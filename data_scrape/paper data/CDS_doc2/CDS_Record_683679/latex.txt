**Abstract**

In this paper, we briefly recall the main characteristics of the minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model, a gauge theory which suggests that parity gets restored at high energy and which may also allow neutrinos to be massive. If neutrinos turn out to be Majorana particles, the See-Saw mechanism implies that the light left-handed neutrinos should have heavy right-handed partners. In this theoretical framework, one may expect the discovery of three new gauge bosons (\(W_{R}^{+}\), \(W_{R}^{-}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\)) as well as heavy right-handed Majorana neutrinos (\(N_{l}\)) at the future LHC. Two possible signals have been simulated in the ATLAS detector : \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to eejj\) and \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\to eejjjj\). After three years of data-taking at nominal luminosity and an appropriate reduction of the background, the first channel may allow us to discover \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{e}\) up to masses of 6.4 and 3.3 TeV respectively, while the second process may lead to the observation of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson up to a mass of 4.5 TeV, provided that \(m_{N_{e}}\) is smaller than 1.7 TeV.

Introduction.

Despite its remarkable agreement with the current data, the Standard Model [1] cannot be considered as a complete theory, since in this framework, too many fundamental questions have not been satisfactorily answered yet. To exemplify this, let us concentrate on the parity violation and the question of the neutrino mass.

The gauge group of the Standard Model is \(SU(2)_{L}\times U(1)_{Y}\). Left-handed and right-handed fermions are treated as isospin doublets and isospin singlets respectively. Furthermore, as the \(W\) boson only couples to left-handed fermions and as neutrinos are exclusively sensitive to weak interactions, there is no need to include right-handed neutrinos in the minimal Standard Model. As a result, one cannot build a mass term of the form :

\[{\cal L}_{v}{}^{mass}=m_{v}(\vec{\nu_{L}}\nu_{R}+{\rm h.c})\]

Consequently, neutrinos remain purely massless in the Standard Model, in spite of the fact that they are almost treated in the same way as the other elementary matter particles. However, since no physics principle forbids neutrinos to acquire masses, it is often presumed that these particles should eventually have very small masses, in accordance with experimental data. This suggests that the Standard Model is not the ultimate theory and, as a consequence, new data in unexplored sectors are needed in order to search for new phenomena that could pave the way to a deeper understanding of this issue.

In section 2, we will describe an alternative model which restores the left-right symmetry at high energy by introducing three new heavy gauge bosons : \(W_{R}^{+}\), \(W_{R}^{-}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\). If neutrinos are treated as Majorana particles, this Left-Right Symmetric Model may also provide an explanation for the lightness of the left-handed neutrinos (\(\nu\)'s) at the cost of introducing heavy right-handed neutrinos (\(N\)'s). Some of the processes which could lead to the discovery of the new gauge bosons and the right-handed Majorana neutrinos at LHC will be described in section 3. Then, a study of the discovery channels in the ATLAS detector will be presented in section 4. Finally, our conclusions and outlooks will be given in section 5. The work which is presented here is an extension of a study which was formerly conducted in [2].

## 2 An overview of the Left-Right Symmetric Model and the See-Saw mechanism.

### The Left-Right Symmetric Model.

The Left-Right Symmetric Model [3] is a gauge theory in which right-handed and left-handed fermions can both take part to weak interactions. In this framework, the parity violation which is observed at low energy would result from a natural suppression of the right-handed currents due to the heaviness of their associated gauge bosons.

In this theory, the gauge group which is considered is \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)_{B-L}\), where \(B\) and \(L\) refer to the baryonic and the leptonic numbers respectively. Under this symmetry, both left-handed and right-handed fermions transform as isospin doublets. Their quantum numbers are summarized in table 1.

In order to spontaneously break the \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)_{B-L}\) symmetry, the following Higgs multiplets are used (the numbers between parentheses are the values of \(I_{L},\ I_{R}\) and \(B-L\) for these fields) :

* \(\phi(\frac{1}{2};\frac{1}{2};0)\) with the following vacuum expectation value : \[<\phi>=\left(\begin{array}{cc}k&0\\ 0&k^{\prime}\end{array}\right)\]
* \(\Delta_{L}(1;0;2)\) and \(\Delta_{R}(0;1;2)\) with the following vacuum expectation values : \[<\vec{\tau}\cdot\vec{\Delta_{L}}>=\left(\begin{array}{cc}0&0\\ v_{L}&0\end{array}\right)\,\ \ <\vec{\tau}\cdot\vec{\Delta_{R}}>=\left( \begin{array}{cc}0&0\\ v_{R}&0\end{array}\right)\] Note that one chooses isospin triplets because neutrinos will be further treated as Majorana fields. If one wants to work with Dirac neutrinos, then only additional isospin doublets must be considered here.

Assuming \(v_{R}\gg k\gg k^{\prime}\), the minimization of the potential which is introduced by these fields in the Lagrangian leads to a condition of the following form :

\[[v_{L}v_{R}-\gamma k^{2}](v_{L}^{2}-v_{R}^{2})=0\]To account for the violation of parity at low energy, \(v_{L}\) must satisfy :

\[v_{L}=\gamma\frac{k^{2}}{v_{R}}\]

The complete spontaneous breaking of the \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)_{B\_L}\) symmetry then leads to the following results :

* in the charged sector, the mass eigenstates are \(W_{L}\) and \(W_{R}\) with the following eigenvalues : \[m_{W_{L}}^{2}=\frac{1}{2}g^{2}k^{2}\,\ m_{W_{R}}^{2}=g^{2}v_{R}^{2}\] Here \(g\) stands for the coupling constant which is associated to both \(SU(2)_{L}\) and \(SU(2)_{R}\). Since \(m_{W_{R}}\gg m_{W_{L}}\), the contribution of the right-handed currents to weak interactions is negligible at low energy.
* in the neutral sector, the mass eigenstates are \(Z^{\prime}\), \(Z\) and the photon. If \(\theta_{W}\) stands for the Weinberg angle, one gets : \[m_{Z^{\prime}}=\sqrt{\frac{2cos^{2}\theta_{W}}{cos2\theta_{W}}}m_{W_{R}}\approx 1.7m_{W_{R}}\] while, for the \(Z\) boson and the photon, the results are exactly the same as in the Standard Model : \[m_{Z}=\frac{m_{W_{L}}}{cos\theta_{W}}\,\ m_{\gamma}=0\]

The minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model is very attractive because it assumes a parity conserving Lagrangian. The difference between V-A and V+A interactions is only due to the Higgs mechanism which generates different masses for \(W_{R}\) and \(W_{L}\). Furthermore, as all fermions are now symmetrically treated as left-handed and right-handed isospin doublets, the neutrinos can be massive.

### The See-Saw mechanism.

Unlike other fermions, neutrinos are electrically neutral particles and can thus be their own charge conjugates. If this turns out to be the case, neutrinos are Majorana particles, which can be described in a two-component spinor formalism [4]. Majorana neutrinos can be introduced in the Left-Right Symmetric Model. In what follows, right-handed (respectively left-handed) neutrinos will be symbolized by the letter \(N\) (respectively \(\nu\)). Under certain conditions, this leads to what is called the See-Saw mechanism. When \(v_{R}\gg k\gg k^{\prime}\gg v_{L}\), the following neutrino mass term is obtained [5] :

\[{\cal L}_{\nu N}^{\,\underline{mass}}\propto(\vec{\nu}\ \vec{N}^{\,\varepsilon}) \left(\begin{array}{cc}0&m_{D}\\ m_{D}&M_{R}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}\nu^{\,\varepsilon}\\ N\end{array}\right)+\mbox{h.c}\]

If \(tan2\theta=\frac{2m_{D}}{M_{R}}\) and \(m_{1,2}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\sqrt{M_{R}^{2}+4\,m_{D}^{2}}\ \mp M_{R}\right)\), the mass eigenstates are :

\[n_{1}=cos\theta(\nu-\nu^{\,\varepsilon})+sin\theta(N-N^{\,\varepsilon})=-n_{1 }^{\,\varepsilon}\]

\[n_{2}=sin\theta(\nu+\nu^{\,\varepsilon})+cos\theta(N+N^{\,\varepsilon})=n_{2 }^{\,\varepsilon}\]Therefore, both \(n_{1}\) and \(n_{2}\) are Majorana fields. As \(M_{R}\gg m_{D}\), the mixing between these two eigenstates is negligible and one has :

* \(n_{1}\approx\nu-\nu^{\varsigma}\) with \(m_{1}\approx\frac{m_{D}^{2}}{M_{R}}\).
* \(n_{2}\approx N+N^{\varsigma}\) with \(m_{2}\approx M_{R}\).

The See-Saw mechanism [6] which was succinctly described above, implies that the masses of the left-handed Majorana neutrinos are inversely proportional to the masses of the right-handed ones. As both \(N\) and \(W_{R}\) have masses of the order of \(v_{R}\), the right-handed Majorana neutrinos are presumably very heavy and consequently their left-handed partners are very light.

### Theoretical and experimental constraints.

Up to now, no evidence has been experimentally found for the production of \(W_{R}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\). The limits which are set by direct searches at the Tevatron are :

* \(m_{Z^{\prime}}>445\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\)[7].
* \(m_{W_{R}}>720\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) if \(m_{N_{\epsilon}}\ll m_{W_{R}}\), or \(m_{W_{R}}>650\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) if \(m_{N_{\epsilon}}<\frac{1}{2}m_{W_{R}}\)[8].

The best indirect limits on \(m_{W_{R}}\) come from:

* the searches for neutrinoless double beta decays, which could possibly be induced by the exchange of \(W_{R}\)'s and \(N_{\epsilon}\)'s. According to the theoretical analysis done in [9], this implies : \[m_{W_{R}}\geq 1.1\ \text{TeV}\times\left(\frac{m_{N}}{1\ \text{TeV}}\right)^{-\frac{1}{4}}\] where \(m_{N}\) is the effective mass of \(N_{\epsilon}\).
* the analysis of the contribution of the right-handed currents to the \(K_{L}^{0}\)-\(K_{S}^{0}\) mass difference \([10]\) : \[m_{W_{R}}\geq 1.6\ \text{TeV}\]

Also, a theoretical analysis of the vacuum stability was performed in [11]. It suggests that at least one of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos is lighter than \(W_{R}\) :

\[(\sum_{l}m_{N_{l}}^{4})^{\frac{1}{4}}\leq 1.18\ m_{W_{R}}\]

Furthermore, in the supersymmetric extension of the minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model, a theoretical upper limit for the mass of the \(W_{R}\) boson was derived in [12] :

\[m_{W_{R}}\leq g\frac{M_{SUSY}}{h}\]

where \(g\) is the \(SU(2)_{R}\) coupling constant and \(h\) is the coupling constant of the right-handed Majorana neutrino to \(\Delta_{R}\). If \(M_{SUSY}\) is of the order of 1 TeV and if the \(g/h\) ratio remains in a 1-10 range as suggested in [12], this inequality indicates that the discovery of \(W_{R},\ Z^{\prime}\) and the right-handed Majorana neutrino could be made at the Large Hadron Collider.

Probing the Left-Right Symmetric Model at LHC.

In this section, we describe the various processes which may allow us to observe a \(W_{R}\) and a \(Z^{\prime}\) at the future LHC. In order to generate \(\mbox{\it pp}\to W_{R}\) and \(\mbox{\it pp}\to Z^{\prime}\) events, we use PYTHIA 5.7 and JETSET 7.4 [13], with the following vector and axial couplings :

* for \(W_{R}:\;g^{f}_{V}=g^{f}_{A}=+1\)
* for \(Z^{\prime}:\;\left\{\begin{array}{l}g^{f}_{V}=\frac{+2}{\sqrt{ cos2\theta_{W}}}(I_{3R}cos^{2}\theta_{W}+(I_{3L}-2Q)sin^{2}\theta_{W})\\ g^{f}_{A}=\frac{-2}{\sqrt{cos2\theta_{W}}}(I_{3R}cos^{2}\theta_{W}-I_{3L}sin^{2 }\theta_{W})\end{array}\right.\)

Furthermore, the default versions of the codes were modified in order to include right-handed Majorana neutrinos with all their decay modes.

### Production of \(W_{r}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) at LHC.

Figure 1 shows the physics process involved in the production of a \(W_{R}\) or a \(Z^{\prime}\) boson in a _pp_ collision :

If the energy in the center of mass is \(\sqrt{s}\) (14 TeV at LHC), then the corresponding cross section is :

\[\sigma_{tot}=\int\!\int f_{1}(x_{1},Q^{\,2})f_{2}(x_{2},Q^{\,2})\tilde{\sigma }(x_{1}x_{2}s)\;dx_{1}\;dx_{2}\]

Figure 1: Production of \(W_{R}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) in a _pp_ collision.

Here, \(f_{1}(x_{1},Q^{2})\) and \(f_{2}(x_{2},Q^{2})\) are the parton-distribution functions, which are used to parametrize the probability to find a given parton \(i\) with a fraction \(x_{i}\) of the beam momentum. In addition, \(Q^{2}\) must satisfy \(Q^{2}=x_{1}x_{2}s\). The physics of the collision is described in the partonic cross section \(\tilde{\sigma}(x_{1}x_{2}s)\).

Figure 2 shows the total production cross sections for \(W_{R}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) as a function of the boson mass.

Let us focus on the fractions of \(W_{R}\) bosons produced with a positive or a negative charge. Table 2 shows how their values, computed using PYTHIA, depend on \(m_{W_{R}}\) :

A first order analytical calculation can be performed to check these values. Let us consider that \(W_{R}\)'s are produced at rest (which is the average situation). With this approximation, one has \(x=x_{1}=x_{2}=m_{W_{R}}/\sqrt{s}\). As the main processes involved in the production of \(W_{R}\) are \(u\bar{d}\to W_{R}^{+}\) and \(\bar{u}d\to W_{R}^{-}\), the production cross sections for

Figure 2: Total production cross section for \(W_{R}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) at LHC.

\(W_{R}^{+}\) and \(W_{R}^{-}\) are roughly proportional to \(f_{u}(x)f_{\overline{q}}(x)\) and \(f_{\overline{u}}(x)f_{\overline{d}}(x)\) respectively. The relative contributions of \(f_{u}(x)f_{\overline{d}}(x)\) and \(f_{\overline{u}}(x)f_{d}(x)\) to the production cross section of \(W_{R}\) are shown on figure 3 : they are in good agreement with the fractions of \(pp\to W_{R}^{+}\) and \(pp\to W_{R}^{-}\) events given in table 2.

### Decays of \(W_{r}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\).

The \(W_{R}\) boson decays into either a \(q_{i}\overline{q}_{j}\) pair or a \(lN_{l}\) pair, provided that \(m_{N_{l}}\) is smaller than \(m_{W_{R}}\). If \(m_{j}\ll m_{i}\), the partial widths of the various \(W_{R}\) decay modes can be calculated with the following formula :

\[\Gamma(W_{R}\to f_{i}\overline{f}_{j})=\frac{N_{C}\,g^{2}m_{W_{R}}}{48\pi} \times|U_{ij}|^{2}\times(1-\eta_{i})^{2}\,(1+\frac{\eta_{i}}{2})\,\,\mbox{with $\sqrt{\eta_{i}}=\frac{m_{i}}{m_{W_{R}}}$}\]

As far as the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson is concerned, the possible decay products are a \(q\overline{q}\) pair, a \(l^{+}l^{-}\) pair, a \(\nu_{l}\nu_{l}\) pair and, if \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\) is greater than \(2m_{N_{l}}\), a \(N_{l}N_{l}\) pair. The partial widths of the various \(Z^{\prime}\) decay modes can be calculated with the following formula :

\[\Gamma(Z^{\prime}\to f\overline{f})=\frac{N_{C}\,g^{2}m_{Z^{\prime}}}{192\pi cos ^{2}\theta_{W}}\times\sqrt{1-4\eta_{f}}\,\left({g_{V}^{f}}^{2}(1+2\eta_{f})+{ g_{A}^{f}}^{2}(1-4\eta_{f})\right)\,\,\mbox{with $\sqrt{\eta_{f}}=\frac{m_{f}}{m_{Z^{\prime}}}$}.\]

Figures 4 and 5 show how the branching ratios of these decays depend on the masses of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos. Two cases have been studied : \(m_{N_{e}}\approx m_{N_{p}}\approx m_{N_{\tau}}\) and \(m_{N_{e}}\ll m_{N_{\mu}}\ll m_{N_{\tau}}\) with both \(m_{N_{\mu}}\) and \(m_{N_{\tau}}\) greater than \(m_{W_{R}}\) or \(m_{Z^{\prime}}/2\).

The calculation has been performed with \(m_{W_{R}}=\,2\) TeV.

### Decays of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos.

If the mixing between \(W_{L}\) and \(W_{R}\) is negligible, a right-handed Majorana neutrino \(N_{l}\), when produced, immediately decays into a charged lepton \(l^{\pm}\) and an off-shell \(W_{R}\) boson, which leads to the production of either a \(q_{i}\overline{q}_{j}\) pair or a \(l^{\prime}N_{l^{\prime}}\) pair, if \(m_{N_{l^{\prime}}}<m_{N_{l}}\). The partial widths of the various \(N_{l}\) decay modes can be calculated using the following formulas [14] :

\[\Gamma(N_{l}\to lf_{i}f_{j})=N_{C}\times\frac{g^{4}m_{N_{1}}^{5}}{6144\pi^{3} m_{W_{R}}^{4}}\times|\!|\!|\!|\!|^{2}\times f_{1corr}(W_{R},N_{l})\times f_{2 \in err}(f_{i},N_{l})\]

\[f_{1\in err}=\frac{6}{a^{4}}\left(2a-a^{2}+2(1-a)ln(1-a)\right)-\frac{2}{a} \mbox{ with }a=\left(\frac{m_{N_{1}}}{m_{W_{R}}}\right)^{2}\]

\[f_{2\in err}=1-8b-1\,2b^{2}lnb+8b^{3}-b^{4}\mbox{ with }b=\left(\frac{m_{f_{i}}}{m _{N_{l}}}\right)^{2}\mbox{ and }m_{f_{j}}\ll m_{f_{i}}\]

In order to compare the branching ratios of the various \(N_{l}\) decay channels, we first calculated the partial width corresponding to \(N_{l}\to l^{\pm}q_{i}\,\overline{q}_{j}\), for \(m_{W_{R}}=2\) TeV and various values of \(m_{N_{l}}\) (see figure 6.a). Then, having fixed \(m_{N_{l}}\) to 1 TeV, we computed the partial width corresponding to \(N_{l}\to l^{\pm}l^{l\mp}N_{l^{\prime}}\) for various values of \(m_{N_{l^{\prime}}}\) (see figure 6.b).

It appears that \(N_{l}\to l^{\pm}l^{l\mp}N_{l^{\prime}}\) decays are minor processes, which will be neglected in the following of this paper.

Search for right-handed Majorana neutrinos \(N_{e}\) in the ATLAS detector.

### Assumptions used in the analysis and detector simulation.

In this section, we will estimate the discovery potential of the ATLAS detector for the \(pp\to W_{R}\to e\,N_{\epsilon}\) and \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{\epsilon}N_{\epsilon}\) processes. The assumptions that we will use in the following are :

* the \(W_{R}\)-\(W_{L}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\)-\(Z\) mixings are negligible.
* the coupling constants which are associated to \(SU(2)_{L}\) and \(SU(2)_{R}\), as well as the CKM matrices for left-handed and right-handed quarks, are identical.
* as for the neutrino masses, we will only consider the two following situations : \(m_{N_{\epsilon}}\approx m_{N_{\mu}}\approx m_{N_{\tau}}\) and \(m_{N_{\epsilon}}\ll m_{N_{\mu}}\ll m_{N_{\tau}}\) with \(m_{N_{\mu}}\) and \(m_{N_{\tau}}\) both greater than \(m_{W_{R}}\) (and thus to \(m_{Z^{\prime}}/2\) as well). This allows to minimize the numbers of parameters used in the calculation of the cross sections. Furthermore, the only \(N_{R}\) decay that we will have to take into account is \(N_{\epsilon}\to e\,q_{i}\bar{q}_{j}\).

The ATLAS detector response is simulated by using the ATLFAST 1.57 code [15]. For this analysis, we are mainly interested in the reconstruction of electrons and jets.

In a first step, the transverse energies of all stable particles (except neutrinos and muons) are summed in calorimeter cells of a given granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) (0.1 \(\times\) 0.1 for \(|\eta|<\) 3 and 0.2 \(\times\) 0.2 for \(|\eta|>\) 3). Then, clusters are defined in decreasing order of \(E_{T}\), by adding all the cells in a cone of radius \(\Delta R\) = \(\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) = 0.4 around the cell with highest \(E_{T}\). A particle identification is then performed for all the clusters found.

A cluster is tagged as an electron when it matches a generated electron passing the selection criteria (\(p_{T}>\) 5 GeV and \(|\eta|<\) 2.5) with \(\Delta R<\) 0.1. Isolation cuts are then applied : the electron must be separated by \(\Delta R>\) 0.4 from other clusters, the difference between the transverse energy collected in a cone of \(\Delta R\) = 0.2 around the electron and the transverse energy of the original electron should not exceed 10 GeV. The energy of an isolated electron is then smeared by using the expected energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter, which is :

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{12\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{\sigma_{n\,\oplus\,st}} {E_{T}}\oplus 0.7\%\]

where the noise coefficient \(\sigma_{n\,\oplus\,st}\) is parametrized as in [15].

The probability of misidentifying the electron charge sign has been implemented to the default version of the code. The wrong sign assignment fraction is 1.4% for \(p_{T}\) = 500 GeV and 13.3% for \(p_{T}\) = 2 TeV ( see figure 4.13 in [16]).

When a cluster is not identified as an electron or a photon, it is classified as a jet. Its energy is smeared according to a gaussian distribution whose parameters are given by :

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{50\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3\%\mbox{ for }|\eta|<3\mbox{ and }\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{1 00\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 7\%\mbox{ for }|\eta|>3\]At high luminosity, a pile-up noise term is added in quadrature (\(\sigma_{pile\to up}=7.5\) GeV for a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.4\)).

Then, to correct for the jet energy leakage, one uses the following calibration :

\[E_{T}^{real}=E_{T}\,\times\left\{\begin{array}{l}1.054+(0.0541\,E_{T}+0.160)^{ -1.37}\mbox{ for jets labelled as $b$-jets}\\ \\ 1.030+(0.0693E_{T}+0.155)^{-1.50}\mbox{ for light jets}\end{array}\right.\]

### A study of \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to eejj\) in ATLAS.

In this paragraph, we will restrict our study to the search for electronic right-handed Majorana neutrinos (\(N_{e}\)'s) which come from \(W_{R}\) decays. The cross section associated to the \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to eejj\) process is given on figure 7 for several values of \(m_{W_{R}}\) and \(r_{W}\), defined as the ratio of \(m_{N_{e}}\) over \(m_{W_{R}}\).

#### 4.2.1 Event selection.

Only a fraction of the expected \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to eejj\) events will be detected in ATLAS. For \(m_{W_{R}}=2\) TeV, the numbers of reconstructed electrons and jets are summarized in table 3 for various values of \(r_{W}\).

For low values of \(r_{W}\), one can notice that more than half of the events have a number of isolated electrons which is smaller than two : the lighter \(N_{\epsilon}\) is compared to \(W_{R}\), the higher its kinetic energy is, which makes it difficult to separate its decay products in the detector. We also notice that the number of reconstructed jets is generally higher than two, because of the remnants of the _pp_ collision and the gluons which are radiated by the quarks coming from \(N_{\epsilon}\) decays. In the following, we will only select events with two isolated electrons and at least two jets in the final state and we will assume that the two jets with highest \(E_{T}\) come from the right-handed Majorana neutrino. The corresponding overall efficiency is also given in table 3.

#### 4.2.2 Reconstruction of \(N_{\epsilon}\) and \(W_{r}\).

As we do not know a priori if a given electron comes from \(N_{\epsilon}\) or \(W_{R}\), the two possible \((ej_{1}j_{2})\) combinations must be examined to reconstruct the right-handed Majorana neutrino. Let \(m_{1}\) and \(m_{2}\) be the invariant masses of the \((e_{1}j_{1}j_{2})\) and \((e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\) systems respectively. When filling the same histogram with these two variables, one obtains the mass spectrum which is shown on figure 8. Note that the distribution is not symmetric around the \(N_{\epsilon}\) peak, because of the final state radiation. To account for this effect, we have chosen to further select the events which pass the following criterion :

\[0.7m_{N_{\epsilon}}\leq m_{1}\ {\rm or}\ m_{2}\leq 1.1m_{N_{\epsilon}}\]

\(W_{R}\) is then reconstructed by plotting the invariant mass of the \((e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\) system. Figure 9 shows the corresponding spectra for \(m_{W_{R}}=2\) TeV and three values of \(r_{W}\). The heavier \(N_{\epsilon}\) is, the less symmetric the distribution is, because the final state radiation increases with the energy of the quarks coming from \(N_{\epsilon}\). As for the \(N_{\epsilon}\) peak, we have chosen to further select the events which are in the \(W_{R}\) peak by defining an assymetric cut :

\[(0.9-0.2r_{W})m_{W_{R}}\leq m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\leq 1.1m_{W_{R}}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|r|} \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{\(m_{W_{R}}=\,2\) TeV} \\ \hline Numbers & \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{Fraction of the events when \(r_{W}\) is} \\ of electrons & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 & 0.7 & 0.9 \\ \hline \(n_{\epsilon}\) = 0 & 3.6\% & 1.1\% & 0.8\% & 1.1\% & 1.4\% \\ \(n_{\epsilon}\) = 1 & 49.2\% & 19.5\% & 14.6\% & 13.9\% & 16.1\% \\ \(n_{\epsilon}\) = 2 & 47.1\% & 77.5\% & 81.9\% & 81.9\% & 79.8\% \\ \(n_{\epsilon}\) = 3 & 0.1\% & 1.9\% & 2.7\% & 3.1\% & 2.7\% \\ of jets & & & & & \\ \hline \(n_{j}\) = 1 & 7.1\% & 0.7\% & 0.3\% & 0.2\% & 0.1\% \\ \(n_{j}\) = 2 & 24.1\% & 13.2\% & 9.9\% & 8.7\% & 7.2\% \\ \(n_{j}\) \geq 3 & 68.8\% & 86.1\% & 89.8\% & 91.1\% & 92.7\% \\ \hline \(n_{\epsilon}\) = 2 and \(n_{j}\geq 2\) & 41.1\% & 76.8\% & 81.6\% & 81.7\% & 79.8\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In order to estimate the mass of \(W_{R}\), the spectra are fitted with a sum of two gaussian distributions.

The following method can be used in order to determine the origin of the two electrons : for each of them, we calculate \(\delta m(e_{i})=\left|m_{N_{e}}^{rec}-m_{inv}(e_{i}j_{1}j_{2})\right|\) and we assume that the electron with the smallest \(\delta m\) comes from \(N_{e}\). Figure 10 shows the corresponding efficiency for various values of \(m_{W_{R}}\) and \(m_{N_{e}}\). Its minimum is obtained for \(r_{W}\approx 0.75\) : in this case, we can consider in a very rough approximation that \(m_{W_{R}}\) is equally distributed among the two electrons and the two jets coming from \(W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to eejj\). As a result, the \((e_{1}j_{1}j_{2})\) and \((e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\) systems are more likely to have close invariant masses when \(r_{W}\approx 0.75\) than in the other cases.

#### 4.2.3 Reduction of the physics background.

All the physics processes which lead to two isolate d electrons and at least two hadronic jets in the final state are potential sources of background. In the framework of the Standard Model (SM), we will consider the following processes :

\[pp\to\left\{\begin{array}{c}W^{+}W^{-},\ ZW^{\pm},\ ZZ\\ t\overline{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\overline{b}\\ Z/\gamma^{*}\end{array}\right\}+\mbox{jets}\to ee+\mbox{jets}+...\]

Their main experimental features are shown on figure 11. The two isolated electrons come from either a \(Z\) or a \(W^{+}W^{-}\) pair, directly or via \(\tau\to\nu_{\tau}\nu_{e}e\). Thus, their transverse energy is rather limited. The same conclusion stands for the two selected jets.

Figure 10: Efficiency of the method used to identify the origin of the electrons as a function of \(m_{W_{R}}\) and \(m_{N_{e}}\).

(a) and (b) Transverse energy spectra for the two isolated electrons.

(c) and (d) Transverse energy spectra for the two jets with highest \(E_{T}\).

(e) Invariant mass spectrum for the (\(ee\)) system.

In order to reduce the background without lowering too much the signal statistics, we have chosen to apply the following cuts :

* \(j_{1}\) and \(j_{2}\) must both have a transverse energy greater than 100 GeV.
* the invariant mass of the (_ee_) system must be greater than 200 GeV : this allows us to eliminate the events in which the two isolated electrons come from a \(Z\) boson, but it also reduces the number of background events in which the electrons have a weak transverse energy.

Only 0.35% of the background events which passed the event selection on the number of reconstructed electrons and jets survive these cuts, while the signal loss remains reasonable : when \(m_{W_{R}}=2\) TeV, it is 59.1% when \(r_{W}=0.1\), 18.4% when \(r_{W}=0.5\) and 14.1% when \(r_{W}=0.9\).

Note that some processes coming from the Left-Right Symmetric Model itself may also fake the experimental signatures of \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to e\,ejj\) :

\[pp\to\left\{\begin{array}{c}W_{R}\to\tau N_{\tau}\\ Z^{\prime}\to e^{+}e^{-},\ \tau^{+}\tau^{-},\ N_{e}N_{e},\ N_{\tau}N_{\tau},\ t \overline{t}\end{array}\right\}+\mbox{jet}\,\mbox{s}\to e\,e+\mbox{jets}+...\]

However, as the corresponding cross sections are very small compared to the one associated to \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to e\,ejj\), we will neglect the effect of these processes in the following of our analysis.

#### 4.2.4 Discovery potential for \(W_{r}\) and \(N_{e}\) in ATLAS.

In order to determine which values of \(m_{W_{R}}\) and \(m_{N_{e}}\) could allow the discovery of the \(W_{R}\) boson and the electronic right-handed Majorana neutrino in the ATLAS detector, we proceed as follows :

* for both the signal and background processes, we apply a cut at 200 GeV on the invariant mass of the (_ee_) system and a cut at 100 GeV on the transverse energy of the two hadronic jets with highest \(E_{T}\).
* then, we compare the number of signal events \(S\) which pass the selection criteria for both \(m_{inv}(ej_{1}j_{2})\) and \(m_{inv}(eej_{1}j_{2})\) to the corresponding number of background events \(B\).

Figure 12 shows the mass spectra obtained for both the signal and the background when \(m_{W_{R}}=2\) TeV and \(m_{N_{e}}=1\) TeV, once the origin of each electron has been determined and after all the cuts have been applied.

For a discovery, one must have \(S\geq 10\) and the signal must exceed five statistical fluctuations of the physics background (i.e. \(S/\sqrt{B}\geq 5\)) in the selected mass window. As it can be noticed on figure 13, after three years of data-taking at low luminosity, the \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to e\,ejj\) channel allows to discover \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{e}\) up to masses of 4.7 and 2.7 TeV respectively. After three years of data-taking at high luminosity, these limits can be pushed up to 6.4 and 3.3 TeV respectively.

Figure 12: Mass spectra of \(N_{\epsilon}\) and \(W_{R}\) when \(m_{W_{R}}\) = 2 TeV and \(m_{N_{\epsilon}}\) = 1 TeV, with the inclusion of the SM background (dashed lines). The plots are given for an integrated luminosity of \(3\times 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), when \(m_{N_{\epsilon}}\approx m_{N_{\mu}}\approx m_{N_{\tau}}\).

#### 4.2.5 Further studies on \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{\epsilon}\to eejj\).

Other physics quantities can be measured in order to further confirm the observation of the \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{\epsilon}\to eejj\) process.

a) Fractions of reconstructed \(pp\to W_{R}^{+}\) and \(pp\to W_{R}^{-}\) events.

Figure 14 shows the fraction of reconstructed \(pp\to W_{R}^{+}\to e^{+}N_{\epsilon}\) events when \(m_{W_{R}}=2\) TeV and for various values of \(m_{N_{\epsilon}}\), before and after inclusion of the background processes. Let us recall that, at the output of PYTHIA, 76% of the \(W_{R}\) bosons are produced with a positive charge.

Let us first concentrate on the results obtained before the inclusion of the background. For a given value of \(r_{W}\), the fraction of \(W_{R}\) bosons reconstructed with the correct electric charge strongly depends on the efficiency of the method used to identify the origin of the electrons. Note that, when \(r_{W}\to 0\), the fraction of \(pp\to W_{R}^{+}\to e^{+}N_{\epsilon}\) events is lower than expected, despite a 100% efficiency for the electron assignment : the smaller \(r_{W}\) is, the higher the energy of the electron coming from \(W_{R}\) is, leading thus to a larger charge misidentification probability.

After the inclusion of the background, the fraction of reconstructed \(pp\to W_{R}^{+}\to e^{+}N_{\epsilon}\) events can still be measured with a good precision, provided that \(r_{W}\) remains sufficiently small.

b) Polarization effects involved in \(\mathit{pp}\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\).

The polarization effects, which appear both in the production and the leptonic decays of \(W_{R}\) bosons, can also be studied at LHC and in ATLAS. For this, we assume that the two partons involved in the production of the bosons have no transverse energy, so that the \(W_{R}\)'s can only be longitudinally polarized. Thus, the \(W_{R}\) rapidity (further referred to as \(y\)) is easy to derive from the beam momentum fractions :

\[E=(x_{1}+x_{2})\frac{\sqrt{s}}{2}\ \mathrm{and}\ p_{z}=(x_{1}-x_{2})\frac{ \sqrt{s}}{2}\ \Longrightarrow\ y=\frac{1}{2}ln\left(\frac{E+p_{z}}{E-p_{z}}\right)=\frac{1} {2}ln\left(\frac{x_{1}}{x_{2}}\right)\]

In the \(W_{R}\) frame, an electron \(e^{-}\) (respectively \(e^{+}\)) is preferentially emitted parallel (respectively antiparallel) with respect to the spin of the boson. If \(\theta^{*}\) is the angle of the electron with respect to the beam axis in the \(W_{R}\) center of mass, one has [17] :

\[\frac{d^{2}\sigma}{dy\,dcos\theta^{*}}\propto\left\{\begin{array}{l}f_{u}(x _{1})f_{\overline{d}}(x_{2})(1-cos\theta^{*})^{2}+f_{u}(x_{2})f_{\overline{d}} (x_{1})(1+cos\theta^{*})^{2}\ \mathrm{for}\ W_{R}^{+}\to l^{+}N_{l}\\ f_{d}(x_{1})f_{\overline{u}}(x_{2})(1+cos\theta^{*})^{2}+f_{d}(x_{2})f_{ \overline{u}}(x_{1})(1-cos\theta^{*})^{2}\ \mathrm{for}\ W_{R}^{+}\to l^{-}N_{l}\end{array}\right.\]

If \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) are such as \(x_{1}x_{2}s=m_{W_{R}}^{2}\), then the fractions of \(W_{R}\) bosons produced in the \(+1\) and \(-1\) helicity states are :

* \(X_{S_{z}=+1}^{W_{R}^{+}}\propto\int_{\frac{m_{W_{R}}}{\sqrt{i}}}^{1}f_{u}(x)f_ {\overline{d}}\left(\frac{m_{W_{R}}^{2}}{xs}\right)dx\) and \(X_{S_{z}=-1}^{W_{R}^{+}}\propto\int_{\frac{m_{W_{R}}}{\sqrt{i}}}^{1}f_{u}\left( \frac{m_{W_{R}}^{2}}{xs}\right)f_{\overline{d}}(x)\,dx\).
* \(X_{S_{z}=+1}^{W_{R}^{-}}\propto\int_{\frac{m_{W_{R}}}{\sqrt{i}}}^{1}f_{d}(x)f _{\overline{u}}\left(\frac{m_{W_{R}}^{2}}{xs}\right)dx\) and \(X_{S_{z}=-1}^{W_{R}^{-}}\propto\int_{\frac{m_{W_{R}}}{\sqrt{i}}}^{1}f_{d} \left(\frac{m_{W_{R}}^{2}}{xs}\right)f_{\overline{u}}(x)\,dx\).

For a given rapidity \(y\), let \(F(y)\) and \(B(y)\) be the number of events with \(cos\theta^{*}>0\) and \(cos\theta^{*}<0\) respectively. Then, \(X_{S_{z}=+1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}}\) and \(X_{S_{z}=-1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}}\) can be calculated using :

\[X_{S_{z}=+1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}}-X_{S_{z}=-1}^{W_{R}^{\pm}}=\frac{4}{3}\left|\frac{ \int_{y>0}(F(y)-B(y))dy-\int_{y<0}(F(y)-B(y))dy}{\int_{y>0}(F(y)+B(y))dy+\int_ {y<0}(F(y)+B(y))dy}\right|_{W_{R}^{\pm}}\]

When \(m_{W_{R}}=2\) TeV, one finds by using PYTHIA that \(X_{S_{z}=+1}\) is roughly equal to \(77\%\) for \(W_{R}^{+}\) and \(71\%\) for \(W_{R}^{-}\). Figure 15 shows that after requiring that the two electrons have the same electric charge to further suppress the background, it is possible to observe these polarization effects as long as \(r_{W}\) remains far enough from \(0.7\) (otherwise the electron identification is not good enough).

### A study of \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\to eejjjj\) in ATLAS

The \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\to eejj\) process can serve as a very good probe for the Left-Right Symmetric Model at LHC and in the ATLAS detector. If \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{e}\) are discovered thanks to this channel, a next step could be the search for the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson. In this paragraph, we will investigate the discovery potential of ATLAS for the \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\to eejjjj\) process. The corresponding cross section is given on figure 16 for various values of \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\) and \(r_{Z}\), defined as the ratio of \(m_{N_{e}}\) over \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\).

Figure 15: Fraction of \(W_{R}^{+}\) and \(W_{R}^{-}\) bosons found in the \(S_{z}=+1\) polarization state, for an integrated luminosity of \(3\times 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

#### 4.3.1 Event selection.

For \(m_{Z^{\prime}}=3\) TeV, the numbers of reconstructed electrons and jets are summarized in table 4 for various values of \(r_{Z}\). For low values of \(r_{Z}\), the number of isolated electrons is generally smaller than two, because the kinetic energy of \(N_{\epsilon}\) is so large that it is difficult to separate its decay products in the detector. Also note that the number of reconstructed jets is generally higher than four, because of the remnants of the \(pp\) collision and the final state radiation. In the following, we will only select events with two isolated electrons and at least four jets in the final state and we will assume that the four jets with highest \(E_{T}\) come from the right-handed Majorana neutrino. The corresponding efficiency is also given in table 4.

#### 4.3.2 Reconstruction of \(N_{\epsilon}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\).

The assignment of the two electrons and the four jets to their correct \(N_{\epsilon}\) decays is achieved as follows : for each \((e_{1}j_{a}j_{b};e_{2}j_{c}j_{d})\) combination, we calculate \(\delta m_{ab}^{\,\,\,cd}=\left|m_{1ab}-m_{2cd}\right|\), where \(m_{1ab}\) and \(m_{2cd}\) stand for the invariant masses of \((e_{1}j_{a}j_{b})\) and \((e_{2}j_{c}j_{d})\) respectively. Then, we assume that the correct combination is the one that minimizes \(\delta m_{ab}^{\,\,\,cd}\). The invariant masses of the selected \((e_{1}j_{A}j_{B})\) and \((e_{2}j_{C}j_{D})\) systems are plotted on figure 17.a. To account for the final state radiation in the \(N_{\epsilon}\) decay, we have chosen to further select the events which pass the following criterion :

\[0.7m_{N_{\epsilon}}\leq\,m_{inv}(e_{1}j_{A}j_{B})\,\,\text{and}\,\,m_{inv}(e_{ 2}j_{C}j_{D})\leq 1.1m_{N_{\epsilon}}\]

The \(Z^{\prime}\) boson is then reconstructed by plotting the invariant mass of the \((e_{1}e_{2}j_{A}j_{B}j_{C}j_{D})\) system (see figure 17.b). Again, to account for the disymmetry of the mass distribution, we have chosen to further select the events which pass the following criterion :

\[(0.9-0.4r_{Z})m_{Z^{\prime}}\leq\,m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{A}j_{B}j_{C}j_{D})\leq 1.1m_{Z^{\prime}}\]

#### 4.3.3 Reduction of the physics background.

All the physics processes which lead to two isolated electrons and at least four hadronic jets in the final state are potential sources of background. We will distinguish between the processes coming from the Standard Model (referred to as background A) and the ones coming from the Left-Right Symmetric Model (referred to as background B).

* background A : \(pp\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\left\{\begin{array}{c}W^{+}W^{-},\ ZW^{\pm},\ ZZ\\ t\overline{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\overline{b}\\ Z/\gamma^{*}\end{array}\right\}+\mathrm{jets}\to ee+\mathrm{jets}+...\)
* background B : \(pp\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\left\{\begin{array}{c}W_{R}\rightarrow\,eN_{\epsilon},\ \tau N_{\tau}\\ Z^{\prime}\to e^{+}e^{-},\ \tau^{+}\tau^{-},\ N_{\tau}N_{\tau},\ t\overline{t} \end{array}\right\}+\mathrm{jets}\to ee+\mathrm{jets}+...\)

To reduce background A, we apply a cut at 100 GeV on the transverse energy of each of the four jets and we select the events for which the invariant mass of the (_ee_) system is greater than 200 GeV. Only 0.05% of background A events survive these cuts.

Among the background B processes, we focused on \(pp\)\(\rightarrow\)\(W_{R}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(eN_{\epsilon}\) since, in this category, it has by far the largest cross section. When \(r_{Z}\) is close to 0.4, \(r_{W}\) = 1.7\(r_{Z}\) gets close to 0.7 and, as a result, the two electrons coming from \(pp\)\(\rightarrow\)\(W_{R}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(eN_{\epsilon}\) might have similar energies (see paragraph 4.2.5 for details). Associated with four jets, they can fake a \(N_{\epsilon}N_{\epsilon}\) pair. To reduce this background, we ask that :

\[m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\leq(0.9-0.2r_{W})m_{W_{R}}\ \mathrm{or}\ m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\geq 1.1\,m_{W_{R}}\]However, when \(r_{Z}\) is far enough from 0.4, imposing that the invariant masses of the selected \((e_{1}j_{A}j_{B})\) and \((e_{2}j_{C}j_{D})\) systems are both between 0.7\(m_{N_{e}}\) and 1.1\(m_{N_{e}}\) is sufficient for a reduction of background B. Table 5 compares the signal efficiency, the number of reconstructed \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) events and the corresponding background, obtained with and without this cut on \(m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\), for \(m_{Z^{\prime}}=3\) TeV and various values of \(m_{N_{e}}\), after three years of LHC running at high luminosity. It shows that the cut on \(m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\) is required for certain values of \(r_{Z}\) only.

#### 4.3.4 Discovery potential for \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) in ATLAS.

To determine the discovery potential of \(Z^{\prime}\) and \(N_{e}\) in ATLAS, we proceed as follows. For both the signal and background processes, we apply a cut at 200 GeV on the invariant mass of the \((ee)\) system and a cut at 100 GeV on the transverse energy of the four hadronic jets with highest \(E_{T}\). We also apply the cut on \(m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\) if it significantly increases the signal-to-background ratio. Then, we compare the number of signal events \(S\) which pass the selection criteria for \(m_{inv}(e_{1}j_{A}j_{B})\), \(m_{inv}(e_{2}j_{C}j_{D})\) and \(m_{inv}(eej_{A}j_{B}j_{C}j_{D})\) to the corresponding number of background events \(B\).

Figure 18 shows the mass spectra obtained for the signal and the background together when \(m_{Z^{\prime}}=3\) TeV and \(m_{N_{e}}=900\) GeV, after all the cuts are applied.

For a discovery, one must have \(S\geq 10\) and the signal must exceed five statistical fluctuations of the physics background (i.e. \(S/\sqrt{B}\geq 5\)) in the selected mass window. After three years of data-taking at low luminosity, the \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\to eejjjj\) channel allows to discover the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson up to a mass of 3.4 TeV, provided that \(m_{N_{e}}\) remains smaller than 1.3 TeV. After three years of data-taking at high luminosity, these mass limits can be pushed up to 4.5 TeV for the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson and 1.7 TeV for the right-handed Majorana neutrino \(N_{e}\) (see figure 19).

Figure 19: Discovery potential for the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson and the right-handed Majorana neutrino \(N_{e}\) in ATLAS when (full lines) \(m_{N_{e}}\approx m_{N_{\mu}}\approx m_{N_{\tau}}\) and (dashed lines) \(m_{N_{e}}\ll m_{N_{\mu}}\ll m_{N_{\tau}}\) with both \(m_{N_{\mu}}\) and \(m_{N_{\tau}}\) greater than \(m_{Z^{\prime}}/2\).

Figure 18: Mass spectra of \(N_{e}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) when \(m_{Z^{\prime}}=3\) TeV and \(m_{N_{e}}=900\) GeV, with the inclusion of the background (dashed lines). The plots are given for an integrated luminosity of \(3\times 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), when \(m_{N_{e}}\approx m_{N_{\mu}}\approx m_{N_{\tau}}\).

Conclusion and outlooks.

The discovery potential of right-handed Majorana neutrinos as predicted by the minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model has been estimated in the ATLAS detector, thanks to the \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\) and \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) channels. After three years of LHC running at nominal luminosity, \(N_{e}\) can be discovered in ATLAS together with the \(W_{R}\) boson, provided that \(m_{N_{e}}<3.3\) TeV and \(m_{W_{R}}<6.4\) TeV. If \(m_{N_{e}}\) is smaller than 1.7 TeV, then a \(Z^{\prime}\) decaying into two right-handed Majorana neutrinos \(N_{e}\) can as well be observed if its mass is lower than 4.5 TeV.

If the new gauge bosons of the Left-Right Symmetric Model are discovered, the LHC and ATLAS will allow us to deeper probe the theory. For instance, we assumed so far that the coupling constants were identical for both left-handed and right-handed fermions. But, it is not necessarily the case [18]. If a new parameter \(\kappa\) is defined as \(g_{R}=\kappa g_{L}\), two methods can be used to measure it [19] :

* a comparison of \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\) to \(m_{W_{R}}\), because \(\frac{m_{Z^{\prime}}}{m_{W_{R}}}=\sqrt{\frac{2\kappa^{2}cot^{2}\theta_{W}}{ \kappa^{2}cot^{2}\theta_{W}-1}}\).
* a study of the polarization effects in the \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to ee\) process through the measurement of the angular distribution of electrons, since it strongly depends on the coupling constants and thus on the value of \(\kappa\).

Further explorations of the Left-Right Symmetric Model at LHC may include the study of the muonic decays of the new gauge bosons (i.e. the \(pp\to W_{R}\to\mu N_{\mu}\to\mu\mu jj\) and \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{\mu}N_{\mu}\to\mu\mu jjjj\) channels), as well as an investigation of the Higgs sector which in this context is more sophisticated than in the Standard Model.
