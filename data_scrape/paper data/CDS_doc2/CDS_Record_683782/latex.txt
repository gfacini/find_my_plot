###### Abstract

We present results of the 1995 Muon Test Beam, obtained with drift tubes with anode wire diameters of 30, 50, 70 and 160 \(\mu\)m. Measurements with high energy muons are complemented with photon data, using \({}^{55}\)Fe and \({}^{241}\)Am sources. The data was taken at the nominal MD T pressure of 3 bar absolute, at zero magnetic field.

For each gas we give gas gain as a function of high voltage, and the fraction of limited streamers, as a function both of high voltage and of gas gain.

Streamer fractions are well below 1% at a gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\), for all gases and wire diameters. Only a weak dependence of the streamer fraction on the wire diameter was observed. Therefore the streamer fraction should have little influence on the choice of the wire diameter.

Introduction

During the beam period in 1995 several gases for drift tubes were studied in the Muon test beam at CERN. Gas mixtures from previous years are now considered flammable which would demand high safety measures if they were to be used in ATLAS. All four gas mixtures we tested have the advantage that they are considered non-flammable by CERN standards at the present time.

The purpose of our measurements was to determine the suitability of the "new" gas mixtures for ATLAS MDT, as well as studying the influence of the wire diameter on streamer rates. In addition to the determination of gas gain and limited streamer rates we also studied maximum drift times and after-pulsing rates.

We studied the gases Ar:N\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)= 91:4:5, Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)= 92:5:3, Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)= 93:4:3 and Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):N\({}_{2}\):CF\({}_{4}\)= 95:2:2:1 with single drift tubes equipped with anode wire of 30, 50, 70 and 160 \(\mu\)m diameter.

Measurements were made with high energy muons in the M2 beam line halo and with gamma sources (\({}^{55}\)Fe and \({}^{241}\)Am) to study the differences in the results with different ionisation mechanism.

All measurements were made at zero magnetic field. We used the nominal MDT pressure of 3 bar absolute [1] for our studies.

The gases studied belong to three classes, all based on argon with small amounts of quencher.

The first gas contains nitrogen, which saturates the electron drift velocity, leading to a linear rt-relationship (space drift time relationship) and a maximum drift time around 480 ns. It has the disadvantage that the few streamers that do occur have a higher charge than streamers in gases without nitrogen. In addition the reaction \({}^{14}\)N(n,p)\({}^{14}\)C can produce 600 keV protons (from background neutrons) inside the tube which contribute to the ageing. A pessimistic calculation (appendix A) indicates that the total deposited charge in the tubes might be increased by 20%.

The second gas contains CO\({}_{2}\), which reduces the streamer charge and the Lorentz angle. The rt-relationship is non-linear and the gas is slow (600 ns maximum drift time predicted by Garfield). The drift properties of gases containing CO\({}_{2}\) seem to be strongly influenced by contaminations, especially water; drift times up to 850 ns were observed in several MDT detectors in the test beam.

The third gas is a derivative of the second, containing less CO\({}_{2}\), which leads to a slightly more linear rt-relationship. The influence of contaminations is reduced but was still significant.

The fourth gas is the only four component mixture we studied. It consists entirely of non-flammable components and provides a linear rt-relationship in a magnetic field of 0.6 T. At higher gains after-pulsing was observed. The influence of CF\({}_{4}\) on ageing has to be investigated.

A full description of the methods and the results can be found in [2] (in German).

The dependence of resolution and efficiency on wire diameter will be discussed in a separate note.

## 2 Setup

Fig. 1 shows the setup in the M2-Halo at CERN. The M2 area was built to test small to medium sized MDT prototypes with high energy muons, and offers the possibility to make studies inside magnetic fields. Trigger systems and several precision references systems are available.

A coincidence of the four hodoscope planes constituted the main trigger for our beam measurements. The hodoscope planes covered an area of 1.4 \(\times\)1.4 m\({}^{2}\), each plane consisting of 16 partly overlapping scintillators. In addition a small scintillator (C1, 4 \(\times\) 100 cm\({}^{2}\)), mounted directly in front of the tubes, was put into coincidence with the hodoscope. For source measurements the signal itself was used to provide a trigger.

The drift tubes were placed inside a reference system of two Cathode Strip Chambers [3] and two Resistive Plate Chambers [4] for tracking.

The setup contained originally 6 tubes with 30, 40, 50, 70, 100 and 160 \(\mu\)m wires. The 40 \(\mu\)m tube was accidentally aged by a continuous discharge over a time period of 3 days prior to our measurements. The discharge was set up to burn away some contaminations in the tube which produced a Malter effect [5, p. 338]. In all our measurements this tube behaved as if it had a 65 \(\mu\)m wire. After the beam period we opened the tube and analysed the wire. The surface was covered uniformly with green crystalline structures. Fig. 2 shows a photograph of the wire surface. An analysis of the X-ray spectrum of the wire revealed a high concentration of chlorine and oxygen, apart from the expected Cu peak (the wire material was CuBe). We believe that the structures are crystals of CuCl\({}_{2}\) and Cu(OH)\({}_{2}\), possibly with water trapped inside the domes. The origin of the chlorine has to be investigated. The wire will be excluded from further discussions.

The 100 \(\mu\)m wire had no electrical contact to the p

Figure 1: Experimental Setupreplacement was manufactured we substituted a second 50 \(\mu\)m tube. The 50 \(\mu\)m tubes will be designated 50 I and 50 II.

The five drift tubes studied had 30 mm outer diameter and 400 \(\mu\)m wall-thickness, and were made of an Al-Mn alloy with no cathode treatment. Table 1 gives an overview of the tube parameters.

Each tube was equipped with separate front end electronics. At the HV end the termination resistor was chosen to match the tube impedance, thus minimising reflections at that tube end. The preamplifier side was terminated with a protection resistor and the input impedance of the preamplifier (22 \(\Omega\) in our case), the sum being smaller than the tube impedance, leading to negative reflections at this end (transmission coefficient tube-termination greater than 1) [6]. This allows us to collect a bigger fraction of charge compared to equal terminations. Table 2 lists the passive electronic components, and fig. 3 shows the circuit diagram.

All tubes were equipped with the L3 preamplifier [7]. The L3 is a fast preamplifier originally built for the L3 wire chambers. It has the drawback that the output must be AC coupled. This coupling produces a shallow (5% of the peak amplitude) but very long (several micro seconds) undershoot. To avoid that the undershoot cancelled out the signal, we had to use short ADC gates that reject the undershoot. The short integration time leads to large correction factors to extrapolate the collected charge to the the total charge deposited on the wire. With our gate width we collected about 10-20% of the

total charge. A careful calculation of the correction factors is necessary since the time derivatives are large. The L3 preamplifier has a gain of 24 mV/\(\mu\)A with a shaping time of 4 ns and provides a differential output. This shaping time is too short and the amplifier gain is too low to trigger comfortably on the 25th electron at a gas gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\), which is the current aim for ATLAS.

The read-out electronics aimed to provide both charge and time information. The non-inverted L3 output was duplicated in an active splitter box (essentially an emitter follower) and provided the analog ADC signal. After this duplication the differential signal was discriminated and provided the time information. We used a 48-channel L3 discriminator card [8]. Thresholds down to 5 mV, well below the recommended 20 mV were used. No oscillations or instabilities were observed. The analog signals were recorded with a charge sensitive LeCroy 2249W ADC. The time information was recorded using a LeCroy 2277 TDC, which allows up to 16 hits per channel. The multi-hit capability was used for simple after-pulsing studies. All discriminator and ADC channels were calibrated individually. Fig. 4 shows a schematic of the read-out electronics. The data acquisition system of the Muon test beam is described in [9].

The gas system used premixed bottles. The tubes were connected in parallel to the gas system, and the flow rate was adjusted to give 1 volume exchange every 6 hours. The pressure was measured with a high precision absolute pressure gauge and regulated via an electronic flow-control valve connected by a feedback loop (MKS Baratron 690, MKS 248 Valve and MKS 250 Controller Unit with MKS 270C Signal Conditioner). For all measurements the gas pressure was kept constant at 3 bar absolute with a rms deviation of 0.1%.

## 3 Gas gain measurements

### Calculation of the Gas gain using ADC spectra

The gas gain \(G\) is defined as the ratio of the deposited charge on the wire and the primary charge. For a given track, the charge \(q_{i}\) of the i-th cluster generates a charge \(G\,q_{i}\) when reaching the wire. If we ignore saturation effects, which are small for proportional mode signals at low rates, the gas gain is independent of the charge arriving at the wire. Therefore the total charge arriving at the wire from the track is

\[Q\ =\ G\sum_{cluster}q_{i}. \tag{1}\]

Some of the charge \(Q\) is lost at the HV end of the tube, and some of it arrives outside the ADC gate, so we collect only a smaller charge \(Q_{col}(\tau)\) -- which depends on the gate width \(\tau\) -- in the ADC.

Assuming a linear response of the electronics, \(Q_{col}(\tau)\) is the sum of charges collected from the clusters,

\[Q_{col}(\tau)\ =\ G\sum_{cluster}q_{col}(\tau_{i})\ =\ G\sum_{cluster}f(\tau_{i})\, q_{i}\, \tag{2}\]

where \(\tau_{i}\equiv\tau-t_{i}\) with \(t_{i}\) the drift time of the i-th cluster to the wire, \(q_{col}(\tau_{i})\) is the charge seen by the ADC from the i-th cluster and

\[f(\tau_{i})\ \equiv\ \frac{q_{col}(\tau_{i})}{q_{i}} \tag{3}\]

is the fraction of the cluster charge that is collected. We write

\[f(\tau_{i})\ =\ \frac{q_{col}(\tau_{i})}{q_{ind,i}(\tau_{i})}\ \frac{q_{ind,i}(\tau_{i})}{q_{i}}\, \tag{4}\]

Figure 4: Schematic view of the read-out electronics for the Munich Single Tubes.

where \(q_{ind,i}(\tau_{i})\) is the integral of the induced current on the wire in the effective gate width \(\tau_{i}\).

For the time range \(0\leq\tau_{i}\leq 1\)\(\mu\)s the ratio \(q_{sol}(\tau_{i})/q_{ind,i}(\tau_{i})\) is approximately independent of the collection time and the exact pulse shape. Fig. 5 shows this ratio (taken from [10], where pulse shapes and the charge fraction reaching the preamplifier are calculated). It will therefore be approximated by a constant, \(f\), given in table 3.

The induced current on the wire, neglecting the electron component, is created by the drifting ion. Assuming a constant ion mobility the induced current for one single-charged ion is [5]:

\[I(t^{\prime})\ =\ \left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{e}{2\ln(b/a)}\,\frac{1}{t^{ \prime}+t_{0}}&(0\leq t^{\prime}\leq t_{max})\\ 0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{array}\right.\, \tag{5}\]

where \(e\) is the elementary charge, \(a\) the wire radius, \(b\) the inner tube radius and \(t^{\prime}\equiv t-t_{i}\) is the time since the cluster reached the wire. \(t_{max}\equiv\ln(b/a)/2\mu V\,(\,b^{2}-a^{2})\) denotes the drift time of the ion to the tube wall. The time constant \(t_{0}\) of the ion pulse is given by

\[t_{0}\ =\ \frac{\ln(b/a)}{2\mu V}\,a^{2}\, \tag{6}\]

with \(\mu\) being the ion mobility and V the applied high voltage.

Integrating (5) gives

\[q_{ind,i}(\tau_{i})\ =\ \int_{0}^{\tau_{i}}n_{i}\,I(t^{\prime})\;dt^{\prime}\ =\ \frac{n_{i}\;e}{2\ln(b/a)}\ln\,\left(1+\frac{\tau_{i}}{t_{0}}\right)\, \tag{7}\]

where \(n_{i}\) is the number of electrons in the i-th cluster.

Regrouping (2), we get a measure of the gas gain for each track:

\[G\ =\ \frac{Q_{eol}(\tau)}{f\sum q_{ind,i}(\tau_{i})}. \tag{8}\]

With our assumption of no saturation effects the gain is independent of the primary charge, therefore (8) holds as well for the mean value taken over all possible tracks and therefore for the mean value over the tube:

\[G\ =\ \left\langle\frac{Q_{eol}(\tau)}{f\sum q_{ind,i}(\tau_{i})}\right\rangle\ =\ \frac{\langle Q_{eol}(\tau)\rangle}{\langle f\sum q_{ind,i}(\tau_{i})\rangle}\, \tag{9}\]

where the angle brackets denote the average value over the tube. The last equality holds because we assumed a constant gain. For this case the collected charge is proportional to the primary charge for all radii; both are distributed with the same function, therefore the average of the ratio equals the ratio of the averages. We also introduced the explicit dependence of the collected charge on the track distance \(r\) from the wire; \(r_{i}\) denotes the distance of the i-th cluster from the wire.

Using the observable ADC value we can substitute the charge of the mean ADC value, \(Q(\langle ADC\rangle)\) for the mean collected charge in (9):

\[G\ =\ \frac{Q(\langle ADC\rangle)}{\langle f\sum q_{i}(\tau_{i})\rangle}. \tag{10}\]

The numerator was taken from the measured ADC spectra, see below.

The denominator was calculated by Monte Carlo methods. For the beam data, the calculation used Poisson distributed clusters along the track and the experimental clustersize distribution of argon, measured by Fischle et al. [11]. The mean value of 105 cluster/cm for the Poisson distribution was taken from [5] (for \(\gamma=1000\)), scaled by a factor of 3 to account for our pressure of 3 bar absolute. We used a maximum cluster-size of 500 electrons. Although events with more than 30 electrons are very rare (\(<1\%\)) they nevertheless contribute to the mean charge, as we have on average 250 clusters per track. The drift times of the individual clusters were calculated by linear interpolation of a Garfield simulation [12]. The Garfield results were scaled to match the observed maximum drift times (see section 5). For the source data the primary ionisation was calculated from the photon energy and the effective ionisation energy of argon (26 eV). The 5.9 keV \({}^{55}\)Fe photon produces 227 electron/ion pairs. The 59.8 keV photons of the \({}^{241}\)Am source are partly converted to 17.4 keV photons in an 0.4 mm thick Mo-foil. We used only the 17 keV peak with a primary ionisation of 670 electron/ion pairs, since the 60 keV photon liberates too much charge which leads to saturation effects. The clusters produced by \({}^{55}\)Fe photons were considered point-like, while those produced by \({}^{241}\)Am were smeared out radially by \(\pm 0.5\) mm from the creation point. Since the source data was taken with a self trigger, all electrons arrive at the same time relative to the gate and contributedthe same fraction of collected charge, apart from the small effect of the smearing. Fig. 6 illustrates the dependence of the collected charge fraction on the HV for both beam and source data.

The dependence of the collected charge fraction for different wire diameters at a fixed HV follows from the dependence of \(t_{0}\) (cf. eq. (6)) on the wire diameter. Neglecting the logarithmic term, \(t_{0}\) depends quadratically on the wire diameter, with less charge collected for thicker wires.

As a final step we have to infer the mean collected charge from the mean ADC value in the measured ADC spectra. For beam data, we set the upper boundary for the mean by cutting off the streamer pulses and, following [5], the upper 5% in the ADC spectrum, fig. 7 (a). The lower boundary cuts off the pedestal. For source data, the peaks were fitted with a Gaussian and a second order background polynomial, fig. 7 (b).

Conversion of the ADC-value into the actual charge used a calibration curve for each channel. For the ADC calibration we fed pulses into the tubes via the test input (fig. 3) which is essentially a potential divider used to attenuate the output of a pulse generator. The ADC gate was triggered by the pulse itself. Only the differentiated edges of the test-pulse were transmitted by the AC coupled L3 preamplifier. The rise-time of the test pulses was chosen so that the undershoot of the pulse is rejected by the gate. We used 100 ns for the source measurements (300 ns gate length) and 300 ns for beam measurements (600-850 ns gate length). The charge \(Q_{calib}\) that arrives inside the ADC gate at the preamplifier input is approximately equal to the voltage drop across R\({}_{1}\) times the effective capacitance of the circuit (C\({}_{1}\) in series with C\({}_{2}\)):

\[Q_{calib}\ =\ U_{0}\ \frac{C_{1}C_{2}}{C_{1}+C_{2}}\ \frac{R_{1}}{R_{1}+R_{4}}\, \tag{11}\]

where \(U_{0}\) denotes the input pulse amplitude, see fig. 3 for symbols. Corrections for the finite gate length, the wire resistance and the HV resistor are at the percent level. The pulse amplitude was varied to give different charges. The corresponding ADC values of 10000 pulses were recorded and calibration curves such as fig. 8 were produced.

The linear dependence of the charge on the ADC channel justifies the use of \(Q(\langle ADC\rangle)\) instead of \(\langle Q(ADC)\rangle\) in (10).

### Gas gain measurement using current integration

An alternative way to measure the gas gain is to measure the current flowing in the tube with no preamplifier and decoupling capacitors. This method was tested by C. Sartena1 with a one meter long drift tube of 3 cm outer radius, 400 \(\mu\)m wall thickness, equipped with a 50 \(\mu\)m wire [13]. The tube was mounted parallel to the M2 muon beam, 30 cm below the beam line. The parallel geometry maximises the primary ionisation of a muon in the tube by maximising the path length. The path length calculation took the beam profile, measured with two movable scintillators, into account. Background was suppressed by requiring the coincidence of two \(10\times 10\) cm\({}^{2}\) scintillators, mounted directly in front and behind the tube. The current drawn by the tube during a beam spill was measured as the voltage drop to ground across a 10 M\(\Omega\) resistor. The current was converted into charge and the gain was calculated as the ratio of the measured charge, divided by the primary charge in the mean track length. A measurement was made for the Ar: N\({}_{2}\): CH\({}_{4}\) = 91:4:5 gas mixture and is in very good agreement with our results for low gas gains. The intrinsic problem with this kind of measurement is to know the muon flux through the tube precisely. For higher gas gains the current measurement overestimates the gain, because no distinction is made between limited streamer and proportional signals. If the streamer fraction and the ratio of streamer to proportional charge is known, this overestimate can be corrected.

## 4 Method of Streamer fraction measurement

### Beam data

The number of streamer pulses for the beam measurements was estimated using an ADC-vs-TDC plot (fig. 9). We applied two cuts, one to cut off the pedestal, the second one to distinguish between proportional and streamer signals. Every hit between the two cuts was counted as a proportional signal, everything above the second cut as a streamer. To obtain an error estimate, we varied the cut position for the streamer by 50 ADC bins, but left the pedestal cut fixed, since it is well defined. The use of the 2d plot allowed us to take the Landau tail and delta-rays into account and approximately correct for them by shifting the cut to higher ADC values.

### Source data

For the source data there is, of course, no TDC spectrum, since we must use a self trigger of the signals. Therefore, we could only use the ADC spectra to decide where to cut. The method stays essentially the same as for the beam data. Two cuts, pedestal and streamer, are applied. The latter was varied by 50 ADC bins to obtain an error estimate. If the streamer charge is small, around 3-5 times the proportional mode charge, it becomes impossible to use the 211Am source, since the streamer signals coincide with the 60 keV peak. This was the case for the Ar:CO2:CH4=93.4:3 gas. Only the 55Fe source can then be used.

## 5 Maximum drift time measurements

The maximum drift times were obtained from the raw TDC spectra; t0 corrections for the Hodoscope time reference were in the order of 1 ns and therefore negligible, as well as signal propagation times (\(\leq 3\) ns). Only the first hits were used, thus avoiding \(\delta\)-electrons and after-pulses which might shift the drift times to bigger values. The values are extrapolations of the slope of the rising and falling edges to a bin-content of zero. Errors were estimated from the deviations of the bin contents from the mean slope and are around 10-15 ns. The measured results are compared with Garfield predictions.

Figure 9: ADC versus TDC spectra. (a) Ar:CO2:CH4=93.4:3 at 3.7 kV, 3 bar, (b) Ar:CO2:N2:CF4=95:2:2:1 at 3.7 kV, 3 bar, the linear rise to the overflow is due to the saturation of the L3 preamplifier. Smaller TDC times correspond to bigger distances.

## 6 After-pulsing studies

Photons created in the avalanche can travel to the cathode and eject electrons (photo effect), leading to a cluster of electrons near the tube wall. The cluster can drift to the wire and create a second avalanche, an after-pulse. The after-pulse spectrum thus starts after the maximum drift time, allowing a simple measure of the after-pulse rate. Fig. 10 shows a spectrum with after-pulses (TDC \(<\) 1170 ns) as well as the hits due to primary ionisation (TDC \(>\) 1170 ns). The ratio of hits in these regions gives a measure of the after-pulse rate. After-pulses are undesirable because they can create fake tracks in the detector. They also increase the total amount of deposited charge. The reduction of the life time however is small, since the cluster charge is typically much smaller than the primary ionisation. The method used here only counts clusters large enough to trigger the discriminator, which is the important statistic for tracking.

## 7 Results

In the following sections we present our results for each gas mixture. They start with the dependence of the gas gain on high voltage, followed by the limited streamer fraction dependence on gas gain and on high voltage. We indicate qualitatively the charge contained in a streamer pulse. Quantitative results are not possible due to the saturation of the L3 preamplifier and the limited range of the ADC. We then discuss the observed maximum drift times and compare them with Garfield [12] predictions. Finally the high voltages and gas gains for a level of 1% after-pulsing are given.

It is possible to extract the Diethorn parameters [5] of the gas from the "linear" part

Figure 10: TDC spectrum of A:CO\({}_{2}\):N\({}_{2}\):CF\({}_{4}\) = 95:2:2:1 gas showing after-pulses, 160 \(\mu\)m wire at 5.3 kV, threshold 50 \(e^{-}\) (the direction of time is reversed).

of the log(Gain) vs HV curves. In the Diehorn model the parameter \(\Delta\Phi\) plays the role of the potential difference necessary to create a new electron/ion pair (the ionisation energy divided by the elementary charge), and E\({}_{min}\) is the minimum E-field to start the avalanche process. E\({}_{min}\) scales with the pressure. With the assumption that the First Townsend coefficient depends linearly on the electric field, the gas gain G is given by:

\[\ln G\ =\ \frac{\ln 2}{\ln(b/a)}\,\frac{V}{\Delta\Phi}\,\ln\frac{V}{\ln(b/a)\,a \,E_{min}(\rho)}\, \tag{12}\]

where \(V\) is the applied anode voltage, \(\rho\) is the gas density, \(a\) denotes the wire radius and \(b\) the inner tube radius.

The Diehorn parameters depend only on the properties of the gas mixture; they should be independent of the wire diameter.

At higher gain values a saturation of the gas gain was observed. The saturation was less for the \({}^{55}\)Fe than for the \({}^{241}\)Am and the beam. This effect was observed in all gas mixtures, suggesting that the total primary charge in the tube per track (227 e- for \({}^{55}\)Fe, 670 e- for \({}^{241}\)Am and around 600-700 e- for muons) is important for saturation effects, not the cluster sizes which are smaller for the muons than for the photons. This could result from the long ion drift times: the wire potential is shielded even for late coming electrons, resulting in a lower gain.

We observed systematic differences in the slopes of the gas gain curves for source and \(\mu\)-beam data, the source curves being steeper. This effect might be caused by the undershoot of the preamplifier. In the long (beam) ADC gates the dependence of the ion-pulse time constant \(t_{0}\) on the applied HV (shorter for higher voltages, see (6)) leads to different amounts of undershoot inside the gate. For lower voltages the gain is underestimated, for higher voltages it is overestimated, tilting the gain-HV curve. The short (source) ADC gates exclude almost all of the undershoot. As an example, fig. 11 shows the difference of the gas gains measured with \({}^{241}\)Am and muons for the Ar:N\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=91:4:5 mixture. It should be noted that the data is consistent within the (systematic) errors. The different slopes of the Gain curves for beam and source data are also obvious in the Diehorn parameters. The beam data always exhibits a bigger \(\Delta\Phi\) (inverse proportional

to the slope of the curve) than the source data. The \({}^{241}\)Am and \({}^{55}\)Fe measurements are consistent with each other for all gases.

Error bars on the gain plots include random and systematic errors. Random errors are due to the uncertainties in the mean ADC-value. Systematic errors come from the ADC calibration and the calculated correction factors which include uncertainties from the primary ionisation, cluster size distribution, Garfield rt-relations, as well as contributions from pulse shaping and charge division factor. The overall systematic error is 10% of the gain value. At low gas gains the total error is dominated by the statistical contribution, at higher gains by the systematic part.

For the streamer fraction, the main uncertainty is in where to place the cut between streamer and proportional mode signals. The error bars were determined by studying the effect of moving this cut, see section 4.

### Ar:N\({}_{2}\):Ch\({}_{4}\)=91:4:5

Fig. 12 shows the gas gain for the muon data. Two data sets were analysed to check the reproducibility of the method and are in excellent agreement with each other. Fig. 13 shows the HV-Gain plot for the \({}^{241}\)Am data, and fig. 14 compares the gas gain for beam, \({}^{241}\)Am and \({}^{55}\)Fe measurements for the 50 \(\mu\)m wires; also included is the data from the measurement of the tube current.

Tables 4, 5 and 6 list our results on the Diethorn parameters. The source measurements give different values from the beam measurements, but within a group the data is consistent.

Fig. 15 and fig. 16 show the measured streamer fractions, for the beam and \({}^{241}\)Am data. Fig. 17 compares all measurements for the 50 \(\mu\)m wires, including the \({}^{55}\)Fe data. The order of the streamer fraction for the source data is expected. The \({}^{241}\)Am photons produce bigger clusters (670 \(e^{-}\)) than the \({}^{55}\)Fe photons (227 \(e^{-}\)). Therefore the charge density is higher for the \({}^{241}\)Am cluster, favouring the creation of a limited streamer signal. The high streamer fraction in the \(\mu\)-beam data is not well understood. For a gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\) the streamer fraction is well below 1% for all wire diameters. There is only a weak dependence of the streamer rate on the wire diameter. For easier comparison with measurements from other groups, fig. 18 and fig. 19 give the streamer fraction dependence on HV.

Unfortunately, we were not able to determine the charge contained in the limited streamer signal. The streamer signals end up in the ADC overflow. In addition, they saturated the L3 preamplifier. Therefore we are can only give a lower limit of 10 times the proportional charge for a limited streamer signal. Measurements by the Seattle group [14] indicate a factor of 70-130 for a similar mixture containing 5% N\({}_{2}\).

The Ar:N\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=91:4:5 mixture has a very linear rt-relationship (fig. 20), with maximum drift times around 480 ns. The Garfield predictions are in good agreement with the observed values (the deviation around 5%), with Garfield being too slow for most HV and wire diameters. The maximum drift times are almost independent of the applied high voltage and the wire radius, see fig. 21. This behaviour is expected for a linear gas, since the electron drift velocity is saturated and does not depend on the electric field.

The Ar:N\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=91:4:5 mixture shows no after-pulsing rates greater than 1% in the whole range of our measurements (up to a gas gain of \(11\times 10^{4}\)).

### Ar:Co\({}_{2}\):Ch\({}_{4}\)=92:5:3

Fig. 22 shows the gas gain for the muon data. For the Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=92:5:3 gas no \({}^{241}\)Am data was taken. Fig. 23 compares the \({}^{55}\)Fe and beam measurements.

Table 8 lists the Diethorn parameters for the muon data. The 30, 70 and 160 \(\mu\)m wires give the same results, within the errors, but the 50 \(\mu\)m wire deviates by a factor of 2. The 50 \(\mu\)m showed the biggest deviations from the Garfield rt-relationship and possibly our simple scaling of the Garfield rt-relationship to match the maximum drift times was insufficiently accurate, leading to the wrong correction factor for the charge extrapolation.

Fig. 24 shows the limited streamer fraction for muons. Fig. 25 shows a comparison between the beam and \({}^{55}\)Fe data for the 50 \(\mu\)m wire. For a gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\) the streamer rate is well below 1%, for all wire diameters. Due to the above mentioned difficulties in the gain measurement, the results for the 50 \(\mu\)m wire could have a large systematic error. The charge contained in a single streamer is small (3-5 times the proportional charge). Fig. 26 and fig. 27 show the corresponding plots for the HV dependence of the limited streamer rates.

The gas mixture Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=92:5:3 has a very nonlinear rt-relationship, see fig. 28. Garfield predictions of the maximum drift time are around 500 ns. Fig. 29 shows the dependence of the maximum drift time, taken from the first hit TDC spectra, on the wire diameter. As expected for a nonlinear gas, the maximum drift time is a strong function of wire diameter. The observed maximum drift times were inconsistent. During the measurement period 3 bottles of premixed gas were used. For the first bottle the measured maximum drift times were up to 300 ns longer than the Garfield predictions; for the second and third bottle, they were 100 ns longer.

The dependence of the drift times on the HV follows Garfield, except for the 160 \(\mu\)m wire. The measurements suggest that the Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=92:5:3 gas is affected strongly by contaminations; temperature changes were uncorrelated with the measured drift times, and the gas pressure was constant. By adding 0.2.0.5% of water in the Garfield simulation it is possible to reproduce the observed drift times for the first bottle. Nevertheless the drift time behaviour of the 160 \(\mu\)m tube cannot be explained by merely adding water. The observed variations are enormous and would require an extremely careful control of gas impurities to achieve the stability needed at ATLAS.

After-pulsing poses no problem for the Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=92:5:3 mixture. The gas gain at which the 1% level is reached is well above the (proposed) working point of \(2\times 10^{4}\), see table 7.

### Ar:Co\({}_{2}\):Ch\({}_{4}\)=93:4:3

Fig. 30 and fig. 31 show the gas gain for \(\mu\)-beam data and \({}^{21}\)Am data. The comparison of the gas gain measurements for beam and gamma-source data, fig. 32, shows the same systematic effect as for the Ar:N\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=91:4:5 gas.

The Diethorn parameters are given in Tables 10, 11 and 12. Again the source measurements give different values from the beam measurements, but within a group the data is consistent.

Fig. 33 and fig. 34 give the results for the limited streamer fraction dependence on the gas gain. No \({}^{24}\)Am measurement was made because the streamer pulses coincide with the 60 keV peak of the source. Of all gases studied the Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=93:4:3 mixture shows the highest streamer rates, but the charge contained in a single limited streamer pulse is small (3-5 times the proportional charge). Fig. 35 and fig. 36 show the dependence of the limited streamer fraction on the HV.

This gas is a derivative of the Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=92:5.3 gas. The amount of CO\({}_{2}\) was reduced by 1% to achieve a (slightly) more linear rt-relationship (fig. 37) and to make the gas faster. The reduction of CO\({}_{2}\) makes the mixture also a little less prone to effects of contaminations.

All observed maximum drift times are slower than the Garfield predictions, with deviations up to 150 ns. Apart from the different maximum drift time values the dependence on the HV follows the Garfield prediction. Fig. 38 shows the dependence of the maximum drift times on the wire diameter for a gas gain of \(2\cdot 10^{4}\). As expected for a nonlinear gas, the drift times become smaller with increasing wire diameter.

After-pulsing poses no problem with this gas. The level of 1% after-pulsing is only reached at high gains, around \(8\cdot 10^{4}\), see Table 9.

Summary

The results obtained can help in the choice of gas and wire diameter for both DATCHA (Demonstration of ATLAS Chamber Alignment) and the final experiment. We discuss the relative merits of the four gases, with a summary in table 17.

The Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\) gases were proposed largely for their good ageing properties and it was also claimed they had a low streamer rate. We find the latter not to be the case, but we do see a very much smaller streamer charge than with gases containing nitrogen. Both gases have a non linear rt-relationship, with the Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\) = 92:5:3 worse than the Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=93:4:3 mixture. In general rt-relations of non linear gases change more quickly with operational parameters (temperature, pressure, high voltage, etc.) than linear gases, making it harder to maintain good resolution. Especially the Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=92:5:3 mixture showed large variations in the rt-relationship during data taking. We observed different maximum drift times even for the two 50 \(\mu\)m tubes which differed only by the gas flow rate: the 50 I tube had a longer small diameter gas pipe connecting it to the gas distributor than the 50 II tube. Small contaminations seem to have big effects on the drift properties of these gases. This makes the working point unstable and very hard to control. Furthermore non-linear gases are predicted to have poor resolution at high rates: the increased sensitivity of the electron drift velocity on the electric field leads to bigger changes in the rt-relationship when local variations of ion charges distort the nominal field. For linear gases this effect is much smaller due to saturation of the electron drift velocity.

The Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):N\({}_{2}\):CF\({}_{4}\)=95:2:2:1 mixture is very promising. It contains no flammable components, enhancing safety. It is very fast, reducing occupancy and reducing the frequency with which one hit obscures another. Both these enhance tracking efficiency. This mixture showed the highest after-pulsing rates of the gases tried, so it would probably be improved by adding more quencher. We recommend studying Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):N\({}_{2}\):CF\({}_{4}\)=90:4:4:2. The effect of CF\({}_{4}\) on ageing would have to be carefully studied. Also the CF\({}_{4}\) could be replaced by CH\({}_{4}\) which has very similar drift properties.

The Ar:N\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=91:4:5 gas performed very well. It is linear, has only three components, is non-flammable and has low diffusion. It has a higher streamer charge, which is probably related to the wave length shifting properties of nitrogen. But since the limited streamer fraction is very low this is not a problem. The reaction \({}^{14}\)N(n,p)\({}^{14}\)C, which produces a 600 keV proton, leads to additional ageing. A pessimistic estimate of the con

tribution to ageing of this particular reaction is given in appendix A and indicates that the total deposited charge on the wire during operation might be increased by 20%. More detailed calculations are necessary. This mixture should be further studied, especially in a magnetic field and for autocalibration.

One of the goals in finding a gas suitable for DATCHA was to have only 3 components. Then of the gases studied here, the Ar:N\({}_{2}\):C H\({}_{4}\)=91:4:5 is recommended for DATCHA.

The wire diameter has an impact on many aspects of drift tube performance. Here we just consider one aspect, namely the limited streamer fraction, which for a given gas gain depends on the wire diameter. Limited streamer signals can contain a large charge (up to around 100 times the proportional charge), so that a small streamer fraction can still contribute significantly to ageing. Our results show that at the proposed gas gain of 2\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\), streamer fractions are low (\(\ll 1\%\)) for all gases and wire diameters. Even at 4\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\), they are acceptable (\(\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$<$}}1\%\)) with most gas/wire combinations. This implies that the limited streamer fraction should not be a big factor in choosing the wire diameter: other factors such as resolution, efficiency, ageing and attenuation in long tubes could be more important. However, it should be remembered that the streamer fraction will increase in magnetic fields as tracks from slow charged secondary particles (e.g. \(\delta\)-electrons) curl up.

Furthermore the effect of wire diameter on streamer fractions is small. The gas gain at which a fixed streamer level is reached seems to have a shallow minimum around 80-90 \(\mu\)m wire diameter. In fig. 49 (a) we plot the gas gain at which the limited streamer fraction reaches the 1% level against the wire diameter for all gases studied. Comparing the dependence of the streamer fraction on the wire diameter between the gases is difficult because of the large fluctuations. To clarify the trend, we average for each wire diameter over the gases, and plot the mean values (filled circles). The gain minimum at around

80-90 \(\mu\)m is then clearly visible. Fig. 49 (b) is the corresponding plot at the 5% level of streamers. Again it shows the minimum at around 80-90 \(\mu\)m. The minimum in the gain as a function of wire diameter at a fixed streamer fraction corresponds to a maximum of the streamer fraction as a function of wire diameter at a fixed gain. The fall off of the limited streamer fraction above 90 \(\mu\)m could be a result of the reduction in charge density at the anode: as the wire diameter increases, at a fixed gain, the height above the wire at which the avalanche starts increases. This allows the avalanche to spread more. However, we do not understand why the streamer fraction decreases in the domain 30 \(\mu\)m to 50 \(\mu\)m. The maximum is also apparent in [15], where there is a rise from 50 \(\mu\)m to 70 \(\mu\)m, which flattens so that the 90 \(\mu\)m wire has the same streamer fraction as the 70 \(\mu\)m.

Fig. 49 suggests the wire diameter either be kept small (\(\leq 50\mu\)m) or large (\(\geq 120\mu\)m) to minimise streamers. However, as already explained, this will have little influence on the detector performance.

The streamer rates depend on the ionisation mechanism and the primary charge. Higher energy photons create more streamer mode signals than lower energy photons. For muons we observed limited streamer fractions comparable to those of 17 keV photons.

All gases showed less than 1% after-pulsing at a gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\), with the Ar:CO\({}_{2}\):N\({}_{2}\):CF\({}_{4}\)=95.2:2:1 mixture coming close to this level.

## 9 Conclusions

With the Ar:N\({}_{2}\):CH\({}_{4}\)=91:4:5 mixture a good candidate for the final ATLAS gas mixture has been found. It has a stable working point, a linear rt-relationship with maximum drift times around 480 ns and shows only very low limited streamer fractions at a gas gain of \(2\cdot 10^{4}\). No after-pulsing rates bigger than 1% were observed, even at very high gains. However, we would like to stress that the influence of neutron capture in N\({}_{2}\) on ageing has to be investigated in greater detail. We recommend this gas for use in DATCHA and for further study for possible use in the final ATLAS detector.

The stability of the working point of mixtures containing CO\({}_{2}\) but no nitrogen is questionable, small contaminations seem to have big effects. In addition these gases have a nonlinear rt-relationship which enhances the influence of changes in the operational parameters (temperature, pressure, magnetic field etc.), and give poor resolution at high radiation rates.

At a gas gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\) and zero magnetic field, limited streamer fractions are low (\(\ll 1\%\)) for all gases and wire diameters. The streamer fraction varies only slowly with wire diameter. Hence the streamer fraction should not be a major factor in the choice of the wire diameter.
