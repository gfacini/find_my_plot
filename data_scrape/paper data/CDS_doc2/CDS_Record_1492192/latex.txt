###### Abstract

In 2012, the LHC has been operating at a higher center-of-mass energy and higher instantaneous luminosity, compared to 2011, providing the experiments with unprecedented amounts of proton-proton collision data. This document summarizes how the challenge of triggering on new physics signatures, such as supersymmetry, using jets and missing transverse momentum, has been approached by the ATLAS experiment.

**Jet and missing transverse momentum trigger improvements for supersymmetry signatures in 2012 with the ATLAS detector**

ATLAS Collaboration

Introduction

To cope with the increased energy, luminosity and pile-up conditions of the 2012 data taking, the ATLAS experiment deployed improvements in the trigger selections and algorithms. Improvements in jet and missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) triggers, relevant to the supersymmetry (SUSY) searches, are summarized in this document.

## 2 The ATLAS trigger system

The ATLAS trigger system consists of a hardware-based component, the Level-1 (L1), and two software parts, the Level-2 (L2) and the Event Filter (EF). The L2 and the EF are referred together as High Level Trigger (HLT). Cost reasons define the limitation in the output bandwidth of both the L1 and the HLT. The detector readout bandwidth and the processing power in the HLT limit the L1 output rate to 75 kHz and the L2 output rate to 6 kHz. The offline computing capacity for storing and processing data promptly limits the EF output rate to O(400 Hz). An additional O(200Hz) is stored for later reconstruction, in the so-called 'delayed stream'. A comprehensive summary of the ATLAS trigger system can be found elsewhere [1].

## 3 Jet-based triggers

The jet-based triggers were improved to no longer rely on the Region of Interest (RoI)-based reconstruction as that is found to exhibit a reduced efficiency for close-by jets. In 2011 a 'full-scan' calorimeter reconstruction algorithm, making use of the full calorimeter readout, was used for anti-\(k_{t}\) jets at the EF level. In 2012, a similar strategy has been implemented at the L2, using a full-scan algorithm involving the L1 trigger towers rather than the calorimeter cells that cannot be read out in its entirety at the L2 input rate. The algorithm, known as 'L1.5 jets', uses \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta=0.1\times 0.1\) trigger towers for the jet identification, rather than the \(0.2\times 0.2\) trigger towers used at L1, thus achieving better resolution.

This improvement had a significant impact on the multi-jet triggers, which are used extensively in SUSY searches for gluino/squark production in multi-jet final states. The 2011 five-jet trigger selection required five anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R\)=0.4, central, uncalibrated jets with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV at the EF, reconstructed using the calorimeter full-scan algorithm. It required five \(R\)=0.4, central and uncalibrated jets with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV at L2, reconstructed using a cone algorithm in calorimeter RoIs identified by the L1. At L1, a \(0.8\times 0.8\) sliding window algorithm was used to select five central jets with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV. In 2012, the EF requirement of the five-jet trigger changed to five anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R\)=0.4, central and calibrated jets with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>45\) GeV. At L2, five \(R\)=0.4, central and uncalibrated jets with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>15\) GeV are reconstructed using the 'L1.5' algorithm, and at L1 four 15 GeV jet RoIs are required. A comparison between the five-jet trigger performance in 2011 and in 2012 is shown in Fig. 1 for a simulated direct top squark (stop) pair production scenario1 where each stop decays to a top quark plus an invisible neutralino giving rise to \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). The use of the 'L1.5' full-scan reconstruction algorithm at L2 and a smaller number of jets in the L1 seed recovers the close-by jet inefficiencies, seen in the plateau of the 2011 five-jet trigger efficiency curve.

In the 2012 trigger menu, the lowest unprescaled multi-jet trigger with jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>50\) GeV is a six-jet trigger. It is similar to the five-jet trigger described already, with an additional requirement for a sixth jet with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>45\) GeV at the EF level. The five-jet selection of jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>50\) GeV is recorded in the delayed stream. A comparison of the performance of these triggers in 2012 versus 2011 for SUSY multi-jet topologies is illustrated in Fig. 2, in a simulated gluino-mediated stop plus top production scenario giving a final state with four top quarks from the gluino pair and missing transverse momentum from the neutralino pair.

## 4 \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)-based triggers

\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)-based triggers are strongly affected by the increased pile-up conditions, and considerable improvements were implemented in 2012 to cope with them. These improvements resulted in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)-based triggers that, in spite of the harsher conditions, gave better performance in 2012 than 2011. These improvements are summarised below.

1. In 2011, the L1 \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) was computed from the transverse vector sum of all trigger towers above a nominal noise threshold of about 1.2 GeV. This configuration suffered from a strong pile-up dependence of the trigger rate. For 2012 the noise thresholds in the forward (\(|\eta|>\)2.5) part of the calorimeters were raised to up to 10 GeV for certain L1 towers to reduce the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) sensitivity to the strong pile-up contamination in this region.
2. There was no L2 \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) calculation and selection in 2011. In 2012, the readout electronics of the calorimeters are used to provide an energy sum of all cells in each individual readout board. This is read out and summed at L2, resulting in an improved \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution compared to L1, and a L2 trigger rate reduction of a factor of more than five.
3. At the EF level all cells above three times the expected noise level were used for the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) calculation in 2011. In 2012 the algorithm changed to a sum over clusters that were calibrated at the

The lowest unprescaled multi-jet trigger chain in 2011 is compared to the lowest unprescaled multi-jet trigger chain in 2012 that stores data into the delayed stream. The efficiency is evaluated in events with at least five central (\(|\eta|<2.8\)) jets and is plotted as a function of the offline calibrated fifth jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

hadronic scale, which further improved the pile-up robustness and the resolution.

The combination of the improvements at L1 and L2 have allowed looser L1 selections in 2012 as compared to 2011. An additional option to veto at L1 the first three bunches in an LHC train, which were found to be the most sensitive to varying pile-up conditions, allowed to further lower the L1 \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) thresholds.

The impact of these improvements on SUSY searches is significant. For example, several all-hadronic analyses used the 'jet & \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)' trigger selection in 2011. In 2012 a significant bandwidth is given to the improved \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) triggers, which render the 'jet & \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)' triggers largely redundant. This results in a higher flexibility when adjusting analysis selections.

The acceptance improvement for SUSY processes is demonstrated in Fig. 3 where the lowest unprescaled trigger in 2011 is compared to those of 2012 in the prompt and delayed streams, respectively. The SUSY scenario chosen corresponds to simulated gluino-mediated bottom squark (sbottom) production in final states with four bottom quarks and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\).
