## 1 Introduction

The Insertable B-Layer (IBL) [1] is the fourth and innermost layer of the ATLAS Pixel Detector [2] for the Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It is one of the major upgrades to the ATLAS performed during the Long Shutdown 1 of the LHC. The IBL is composed of 14 staves surrounding the beam pipe (Figure 1(a)). Each stave comprises a 70 cm-long mechanical structure called the bare stave which holds a titanium cooling pipe. For each stave there are 12 planar pixel sensors are placed at the central region of the stave, each of which is connected to two front-end chips, and four 3D sensors, each of which is connected to single front-end chip, are placed on the both extremities of the stave. Each stave mounts 32 pixel front-end chips[3] in total, which are connected to the readout service bus, the Stave Flex, which is glued on the other side of the bare stave.

During the commissioning of the IBL, it was observed that the IBL staves exhibit a distortion of the shape from the design geometry. The distortion is found to depend on the operating temperature and is caused by a mismatch between the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE) of the components in the IBL staves. The maximum displacement due to the distortion is more than 300 \(\mu\)m at the planned operating temperature of \(-20\)\({}^{\circ}\)C with respect to the nominal position at room temperature. Therefore, the stability of the operation temperature will be crucial for the precision of position measurements of charged particle tracks with the IBL.

This note reports preliminary investigations of the characteristic of this distortion and is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) which confirms that the distortion is driven by the mismatch of the CTE. Section 3 reports track-based alignment results and measurements of the distortion using the cosmic-ray events. The size of the distortion is quantitatively determined and parametrized as a function of temperature. Section 4 provides a study of the IBL stability using the temperature monitoring system during the cosmic-ray data-taking. The effect on the transverse impact parameter is presented in Section 5 using a simulation with distortion model derived from the observed temperature stability. A brief summary and preliminary consequences are discussed in Section 6.

## 2 Finite Element Analysis

The IBL staves are mounted on the Inner Positioning Tube and are fixed at the End-Blocks at both ends of the stave as illustrated in Figure 1. Each stave is constrained to the Inner Positioning Tube at the both ends of the stave named End-blocks (Figure 1(b), Figure 2(a)); for the \(-z\)-direction side, the stave is tightened with a screw and the positioning pin, and for the \(+z\)-direction side it is aligned with a pin and the stave is allowed to move in \(z\)-direction by \(\pm 0.5\) mm. Staves are constrained to each other via the central ring which sits at the middle of the stave (see Figure 2(b)). The central ring constrains the radial displacement of the staves, but allows motion in the azimuthal direction. A three-dimensional finite element analysis (FEA) is performed to understand the observed large distortion of the IBL staves [1]. The model is 14-fold symmetric around the beam pipe and considers the detailed structure of the staves. The FEA implements the constraint due to the central ring and mechanical boundary conditions at screws, alignment pins and glues. A uniform temperature is assumed over the full package of the IBL in calculation of the distortion in this simulation.

The FEA simulation shows that the stave bows to the negative \(\phi\)-direction in the ATLAS global coordinate system1 when it is cooled down (Figure 3). The CTE of the bare stave is almost zero ppm, while the polyvinylde flex bus line (Stave Flex) glued on one side of the bare stave is several tens of ppm. It is thought that the Stave Flex shrinks more than the bare stave, resulting in the bowing of the stave, towards the azimuthal direction. The FEA simulation also predicts radial distortions other than the region around the central ring.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the interaction point to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r\),\(\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe.

The FEA simulation calculates that the magnitude of the bowing is expected to be approximately parabolic to the azimuthal direction with maximum at the center of the stave (Figure 3(b)). At \(\varDelta T=-60\)\({}^{\circ}\)C from the nominal temperature the magnitude of the displacement is calculated to be about \(-0.27\) mm at the center of the stave in the negative \(\phi\)-direction (or in the local-\(x\) direction; see the figure). Note that the scale uncertainty of the calculation of the distortion magnitude is considered to be sizable due to lacking the precise informations of some material properties (e.g. CTE of the Stave Flex) as well as implementation of the detailed structure (e.g. glueing of components). It is calculated that the distortion size is proportional to the temperature difference from the nominal temperature.

## 3 Measurement of distortion size as a function of set temperature

In order to study the temperature correlation to the size of the IBL distortion, cosmic-ray events were collected in March 2015 at different temperature set points: \(+15\)\({}^{\circ}\)C \(\rightarrow\)\(+7\)\({}^{\circ}\)C \(\rightarrow\)\(0\)\({}^{\circ}\)C \(\rightarrow\)\(-10\)\({}^{\circ}\)C \(\rightarrow\)\(-20\)\({}^{\circ}\)C. To quantify the size of the IBL distortion, track-based alignment corrections [4] are applied to determine the positions of the IBL modules as well as their geometrical distortions relative to the nominal (ideal simulated) geometry.

Figure 1: (a) Cross-section view of the IBL Layout seen from the interaction point to \(+z\)-direction. (b) The layout of the bare stave. The stave is constrained to the Inner Positioning Tube at the both end-blocks, and it is also fixed to the central ring at the central fixation jig. For the end-block of the \(-z\)-direction side, the stave is tightened with a screw and the positioning pin, and for the \(+z\)-direction side it is aligned with a pin and the stave is allowed to move in \(z\)-direction by \(\pm 0.5\) mm.

There are more than \(5\times 10^{5}\) events of cosmic-ray data accumulated at each temperature set point with both the toroid field and the solenoid field on. The trigger for cosmic-ray events is the Fast-OR trigger of the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT), a hardware-based logical OR of the TRT wires having a hit along a likely muon track path. The trigger efficiency is over 90% [5] and an average rate of 4.84 Hz. Tracks are reconstructed from hits measured by three subdetectors: the Pixel Detector (including the IBL), the Semiconductor Tracker (SCT), and TRT. 17% of Fast-OR triggered events were used in the distortion studies after a series of track quality cuts:

* \(N_{\text{Pixel}}+N_{\text{SCT}}\geq 4\): at least four silicon hits.
* \(N_{\text{TRT}}\geq 25\): at least 25 hits in the TRT.
* \(p_{T}^{\text{Track}}\geq 2\) GeV: 2 GeV threshold of the transverse momentum.

The \(p_{T}^{\text{Track}}\geq 2\) GeV is applied in order to reduce the impact of multiple scattering in the traversed material.

The unbiased track-to-hit residual vector, \(\vec{r}_{\text{res}}\), is used to quantify the distortion of the IBL. It is defined as

\[\vec{r}_{\text{res}}\equiv\vec{r}_{\text{hit}}-\vec{r}_{\text{exp}}, \tag{1}\]

where \(\vec{r}_{\text{hit}}\) is the vector of measurements of the hit position in the module and \(\vec{r}_{\text{exp}}\) is the expected position according to the track fitting. Both are defined in the local coordinate system2 of the module registering the hit. The schematic drawing of the local residual vector and the transformation from the local coordinate system to the global coordinate system3 are shown in Figure 4. Residuals are defined as un

biased, when the hits on a certain module are removed from the track fit before computing the track-to-hit residual.

To demonstrate the distortion effect due to temperature variation, a set of initial alignment constants with ideal geometry of flat staves is used as the reference constant set for the track reconstruction. There is a global alignment for the whole IBL as a rigid body to account for global displacement of the IBL with respect to the other ID sub-detectors. There are total 3 degrees of translation and 3 degrees of rotation for the IBL. This initial alignment corrections [4] is derived from the cosmic-ray data collected in February 20154. Figure 5 shows the observed local \(x\)-residual averaged over all modules of the same global \(z\) position in different staves (each data point contains the contribution of 14 modules). The distribution of the \(+15\)\({}^{\circ}\)C temperature set point is flat within a few tens of micrometers. It implies that the stave distortion is not sizable at the temperature set point closer to room temperature (\(+20\)\({}^{\circ}\)C).

Footnote 4: The initial alignment corrections are derived using the cosmic-ray events collected at \(-5\)\({}^{\circ}\)C with both toroid field and the solenoid field off.

In order to quantitatively estimate the temperature gradient, a set of module level alignment correction was calculated using the data collected at \(-20\)\({}^{\circ}\)C. The module level alignment takes each individual IBL module as the basic element of the geometry correction. Three degrees of translations, and one degree of rotations around local-\(z\) axis are allowed. There are 840 degrees of freedom in total for the IBL. The observed residual after this alignment correction at \(-20\)\({}^{\circ}\)C in the Figure 6 is consistent with zero, which shows that the distortion of the IBL can be corrected with the alignment algorithm. The \(y\)-residual shows no temperature dependence effect within 20 \(\mu\)m uncertainty.

As described in Section 2, the FEA simulation calculates that the averaged local-\(x\) residuals \(\varDelta x_{L}\), is expected to be parabolic. Therefore a fitting function to describe \(\varDelta x_{L}\), is parametrized with the following parabolic function:

\[\varDelta x_{L}(z)=B-\frac{M}{z_{0}^{2}}(z^{2}-z_{0}^{2}) \tag{2}\]

Figure 4: The coordinate system of the track-to-hit residual vector of the IBL module. The two dimentional local residual vector is calculated in each module frame. The approximate mapping of the local coordinate system (indexed \(L\)) to the ATLAS global coordinate system (indexed \(G\)) is indicated.

where \(z\) is the global \(z\) position of the module, \(z_{0}\equiv 366.5\) mm is the fixing point of the stave at both ends, \(B\) is the baseline which describes the overall translation of the whole stave and \(M\) is the magnitude of the distortion at the center of the stave. \(B\) is set to a common constant for all temperature points because the end-blocks of each stave are fixed mechanically. \(M\) is the free parameter in the fit and it can be used to quantify the size of the distortion. The parametrization function describes distortion shape of each temperature point as presented in Figure 6(a).

Figure 7 shows the magnitude of the distortion as function the operating temperature. A linear dependence on operating temperature of the magnitude of the distortion is observed. The temperature gradient of the magnitude of the distortion, \(M\), is fit as

\[\frac{dM}{dT}=-10.6\pm 0.7\ [\mu\mathrm{m/K}]. \tag{3}\]

The uncertainty on the above gradient is estimated by comparing to a fit performed without constraining the baseline \(B\) in addition to the statistical uncertainty. The observation supports the hypothesis that the distortion is driven by the mismatch of the coefficient of thermal expansion.

## 4 Temperature stability during cosmic-ray data-taking

The sources of the instability of the IBL temperature are classified as:

* The intrinsic stability of the cooling system and the ambient environment
* The variation of power consumption of the front-end modules and the services as the heat load

Figure 5: The track-to-hit residual mean in the local-\(x\) direction. The residual mean is averaged over all hits of modules at the same global-\(z\) positon. There is no alignment corrections applied to the local positions in the IBL module frame during the track reconstruction.

Figure 6: The track-to-hit residual mean in the (a) local-\(x\) and (b) the local-\(y\) direction. The residual mean is averaged over all hits of modules at the same global-\(z\) positon. The alignment corrections derived at \(-20\)\({}^{\circ}\)C are applied to the local positions in the module frames. For local-\(x\), each data set is fitted to a parabola which is constrained to match to the baseline \(B=0\) at \(z=\pm z_{0}=\pm 366.5\) mm (see Eq. 2).

Since the thermal capacity of the cooling system is much larger than the module's power consumption, the cooling pipe temperature stability is assumed to be decoupled from the variation of the power consumption.

The stability of the temperature of the IBL cooling system was investigated using the temperature sensor monitoring system during the same cosmic-ray run studied in the previous section. There are 10 negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors for each stave. They are composed of one NTC for every four front-end chips (eight in total per stave) and one NTC for each of the inlet and outlet sides of the cooling pipe at \(z\simeq\pm\)700 mm. The precision of the NTC sensors on modules and the sensors on the cooling pipe is estimated to be 0.02-0.03 K. The IBL employs a bi-phase CO\({}_{2}\) cooling system [6]. The coolant, CO\({}_{2}\), is liquid at the inlet and it transits to bi-phase (gas and liquid) as it absorbs the heat dissipated in the stave. The actual position of transition varies by staves. Therefore the outlet side is considered to represent the temperature of the coolant temperature reference more accurate than the inlet side. On the other hand, the NTC sensors on modules are used to evaluate the temperature stability at the modules.

For each sensor \(i\) of each run \(k\), the temperature value is read out \(N_{i}^{(k)}\) times in the detector control system, while each run is a block of the data-taking period. The standard deviation and the peak-to-peak values of each sensor \(i\) of each run \(k\) are defined as:

Standard deviation : \[\delta T_{i}^{(k)} \equiv\sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{i}^{(k)}}\sum_{j}\left(T_{i}^{(k)}[j]- \langle T_{i}^{(k)}\rangle\right)^{2}}\ ;\] (4) Peak to peak : \[\Delta T_{i}^{(k)} \equiv\max_{(j)}\left(T_{i}^{(k)}[j]\right)-\min_{(j)}\left(T_{i} ^{(k)}[j]\right)\,\] (5)

where \(T_{i}^{(k)}[j]\) is the \(j\)-th temperature readout and \(\langle T_{i}^{(k)}\rangle\) represents the average temperature read out. For the cooling pipe outlet, there are 14 sensors in total. The standard deviation of \(\delta T_{i}^{(k)}\) over 14 sensors,

Each data point is a best fit of a parabola to the local-\(x\) residual mean as function of the global-\(z\) of the module position. The alignment corrections derived at \(-20\)\({}^{\circ}\)C are applied to the local positions in the module frames.

denoted as \(\delta(\delta T^{(k)})\) is defined as follows:

\[\delta(\delta T^{(k)})\equiv\sqrt{\frac{1}{14}\sum_{i}\left(\delta T ^{(k)}_{i}-\langle\delta T^{(k)}\rangle\right)^{2}}, \tag{6}\]

where \(\langle\delta T^{(k)}\rangle\) represents the average of \(\delta T^{(k)}_{i}\) over 14 sensors. Figure 8 shows the results of the stability study using the cooling outlet pipe temperature sensors. Each bar represents a run. There are two kinds of bars denoted as "RMS" and "peak-to-peak". The vertical range of the RMS bar for each run \(k\) is defined as:

\[\text{RMS}:\ \left[\langle\delta T^{(k)}\rangle-\delta(\delta T^{(k)} ),\ \langle\delta T^{(k)}\rangle+\delta(\delta T^{(k)})\right], \tag{7}\]

and the vertical range of the peak-to-peak bar is defined as:

\[\text{Peak to peak}:\ \left[\min_{(i)}\left(\Delta T^{(k)}_{i} \right),\ \max_{(i)}\left(\Delta T^{(k)}_{i}\right)\right] \tag{8}\]

The width of each bar represents the duration of the corresponding run. As seen in the plot, the RMS bar of the temperature during a run is well within 0.05 K while the peak-to-peak bar is within 0.2 K.

The same summarization of the stability is performed for 112 NTC sensors on the modules, and the result is shown in Figure 9. For most of the runs the peak-to-peak value of them are within 0.25 K, which is not significantly larger than the stability of the outlet cooling pipe of 0.2 K. The maximum peak-to-peak values in some of the runs are close to 0.4 K. These excess values are recorded by the sensors which are the closest to the inlet cooling pipe. It is considered that the temperature fluctuation at this position is caused by the bi-phase transition of the CO\({}_{2}\) coolant. Such a local temperature fluctuation is expected to have small impact to the global distortion of the stave. The fact that the variation of module temperature is not very deviated from the cooling output pipe temperature stability indicates that the dominant source of the module temperature variation could be considered to be from the stability of the cooling system and environment.

In this report, the mechanical stability study is only performed in the stable cosmic-ray data-taking where the power consumption of the front-end modules (and hence that of the Stave Flex) is relatively stable than that in the proton-proton collision data-taking. There are two major factors affecting the power consumption of the modules: one is the module operation procedure and the other is the hit occupancy. To protect modules against unstable collision beams, the IBL modules are kept at high discriminator threshold and the high-voltage bias to the sensor is switched off in the beginning of beam collision data-taking. Once the stable beam condition is declared and the low background activities are verified by the monitoring system, the IBL modules are switched to data-taking operation with lower discriminator threshold and activation of the high-voltage. During this operation, the power consumption of the modules increases and results in temperature rise-up by about 0.5 K. The time constant of this transition in temperature measured by the module NTC sensors is less than 10 s. The hit occupancy of the front-end modules depends on the instantaneous luminosity of the collision beams which induces variation of the power consumption of the modules via the hit latency counters in the modules. No dedicated data-taking has been made to quantify the effect of power consumption variation to the mechanical stability. The temperature stability during collision beam condition is under investigation.

Each bar represents the block of data taking period called runs. The width of each bar represents the duration of the data-taking of the run. For each cooling pipe sensor, the RMS and the peak-to-peak values of the temperature readout during the run are calculated. The “RMS” bar in the figure represents the variance of the RMS values of the 14 temperature sensors with indicating \(\pm\)1 RMS range around the average RMS. The “peak-to-peak” bar represents the variance of the peak-to-peak values of the 14 sensors with indicating the maximum and the minimum values among peak-to-peak values among the 14 sensors.

The “peak-to-peak” bar represents the variance of the peak-to-peak values of the 112 temperature sensors with indicating the maximum and the minimum peak-to-peak values among the 112 temperature sensors.

## 5 Effect on the transverse impact parameter

In order to assess the effect of track reconstruction under varying temperature conditions, a set of alignment constants is produced to mimic the IBL stave distortion in the local-\(x\) axis. It is assumed that a certain amount of displacement of module positions, generated by the temperature fluctuation under stable collision data-taking, is not corrected by the alignment procedure. For this estimation, the same distortion model as given in Equation 2 is used. The magnitude of the distortion is corresponding to a \(\delta T_{\rm flex}=-0.2\) K (\(\sim 2~{}\mu\)m of displacement at the center of the stave).

It is expected that the transverse impact parameter (\(d_{0}\)) of a charged track is the most sensitive track parameter to the distortion of the IBL. Figure 10 shows the \(d_{0}\) distribution of muon charged tracks with respect to the beamspot using the Monte Carlo simulation of \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events in \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV proton-proton collisions based on the nominal geometry and the distortion geometry. For each event, only a pair of opposite-sign reconstructed muons with the invariant mass of \(60<m_{\mu\mu}<120\) GeV, and with the opening angle of two muons greater than 0.2 radians is selected. The track quality selection is similar to the requirement described in Section 3 except the minimum threshold of the transverse momentum is increased to \(15~{}\rm{GeV}\). A bias of \(\sim 1~{}\mu\)m is observed by comparing the mean values between the nominal distribution and the distorted distribution. It is small in comparison to the expected \(d_{0}\) resolution, \(O(10~{}\mu\)m). In Figure 10, the full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the \(d_{0}\) distribution includes the transverse size of the beamspot, \(14~{}\mu\)m \(\times 14~{}\mu\)m and doesn't change due to this distortion model.

Solid circle shows the nominal geometry and the open square shows the distorted geometry corresponding to a temperature variation of the IBL at \(-0.2\) K (\(\sim 2~{}\mu\)m of displacement at the center of the stave).

## 6 Summary

In this report, the preliminary studies of the distortion of the IBL stave driven by the operating temperature are presented. The studies include thermo-mechanical analyses using the finite element analysis (FEA), track-based alignment of position corrections of the IBL modules on track reconstruction, measurements of the distortion as a function of temperature using cosmic-ray data, evaluations of the temperature stability of the system, and assessments of the effect of the distortion on track reconstruction.

The observed distortion of the IBL staves using the cosmic-ray data agrees qualitatively with the FEA simulation in the aspects of the distortion shape and the linear dependence of the magnitude of the distortion as a function of temperature. These support that the observed distortion is the consequence of a mismatch in the coefficient of thermal expansion between the bare stave and the Stave Flex glued on it. The size of the distortion is mainly determined by the temperature of the Stave Flex. Using the temperature scan during cosmic-ray data-taking, the gradient of the magnitude of the distortion is measured to be \(\sim 10~{}\mu\mathrm{m/K}\).

The maximum displacement of the IBL module position relative to the nominal geometry is greater than \(300~{}\mu\mathrm{m}\) at \(-20~{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\). It is possible to correct for this displacement with track-based alignment when the distortion is static in time. The remaining bias comes from the fluctuation of the temperature of the system.

Based on the data collected from the temperature sensors of the IBL during the stable cosmic-ray data-taking, the size of the peak-to-peak temperature variation of the IBL staves is measured to be less than \(0.2~{}\mathrm{K}\). The effect of the IBL distortion due to temperature variation of \(0.2~{}\mathrm{K}\) is estimated using \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events from a Monte Carlo simulation of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13~{}\mathrm{TeV}\). The expected bias to the transverse impact parameter (\(d_{0}\)) of charged tracks is \(\sim 1~{}\mu\mathrm{m}\). It is small in comparison to the expected \(d_{0}\) resolution, \(O(10~{}\mu\mathrm{m})\).

The mechanical stability study due to module power consumption variations in proton-proton collisions is under investigation.
