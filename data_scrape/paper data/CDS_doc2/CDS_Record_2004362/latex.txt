A study of the sensitivity to the Pythia8 parton shower parameters of \(t\bar{t}\) production measurements in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Various measurements of \(t\bar{t}\) observables, performed by the ATLAS experiment in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV, are used to constrain the initial- and final-state radiation parameters of the Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator. The resulting tunes are compared to previous tunes to the \(Z\) boson transverse momentum at the LHC, and to the LEP event shapes in \(Z\) boson hadronic decays. Such a comparison provides a test of the universality of the parton shower model. The tune of Pythia8 to the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements is applied to the next-to-leading-order generators MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Powheg, and additional parameters of these generators are tuned to the \(t\bar{t}\) data. For the first time in the context of parton shower tuning in Monte Carlo simulations, the correlation of the experimental uncertainties has been used to constrain the parameters of the Monte Carlo models.

## 1 Introduction

The physics models employed in the Monte Carlo (MC) event generators are expected to describe simultaneously a large variety of hard scattering processes in different types of collisions [1]. Stringent tests of the universality of such models can be obtained by performing independent optimisation of their parameters, henceforth referred to as _tunes_, on various hard scattering processes, on various observables, at various collider energies, or with different collider types [2]. As suggested in Ref. [3], the consistency of independent tunes supports the universality of the model, whereas deviations from this universal behaviour can be associated with a breakdown of the modelling. The observed deviations between data and predictions, and the tensions between the various observables, can provide important information on the nature of the breakdown.

Measurements of \(t\bar{t}\) production in hadronic collisions are sensitive to the parameters of the parton shower models. At the LHC \(pp\) collider, for the first time, \(t\bar{t}\) processes can be measured with enough accuracy to be used for constraining the parameters of the MC models. The ATLAS experiment has performed various measurements of \(t\bar{t}\) observables in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV, sensitive to QCD radiation [4, 5, 6, 7], some of which have been recently used in the A14 [8] global tune of Pythia8[9]. This note aims at studying the sensitivity of these \(t\bar{t}\) measurements to the initial- (ISR) and final-state radiation (FSR) parameters of the Pythia8 MC. Also, by performing independent tunes to these measurements, the resulting optimised values of the parameters can be compared to the values constrained by other observables, such as the \(Z\) boson transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), as measured by ATLAS [10] and event shapes in \(Z\) boson hadronic decay as measured at LEP [11, 12, 13, 14]. The compatibility of the resulting parameters is a prerequisite for the use of the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements in the context of global tunes.

The modelling of ISR and FSR in \(t\bar{t}\) events is crucial for a precise measurement of the mass of the top quark, \(m_{t}\). In the most precise single measurement of \(m_{t}\) at the Tevatron, performed with the D0 experiment [15, 16], the uncertainty due to the modelling of ISR and FSR is constrained from the measurement of the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson transverse momentum distribution [17], an idea first introduced by the CDF experiment in Ref. [18]. This technique, which provides a significant reduction of the modelling uncertainty, assumes the universality of the parton shower model between \(Z\) boson and \(t\bar{t}\) production. Whereas at the Tevatron proton-antiproton collider both processes are dominated by quark-antiquark initiated production, at the LHC the \(t\bar{t}\) process is dominated by gluon-gluon initiated production, and even more so the universality of ISR needs to be verified.

The NLO+PS MC event generators include next-to-leading-order (NLO) corrections, in the perturbative expansion in the strong-coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}\), to the calculations of the matrix elements of the \(pp\to t\bar{t}\) process, and supplement them with parton showers (PS). With respect to Pythia8, which calculates the hard scattering only at leading-order (LO), the NLO+PS predictions are less sensitive to variations of the renormalisation and factorisation scales and have better accuracy in the total cross sections rates. The NLO+PS generators are also expected to benefit from an improved tune of the parton showers, and to this purpose, the Pythia8 tunes to the ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\) measurements are applied to the NLO+PS generators Powheg+Pythia8[19, 20, 21] and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8[22]. Additional parameters of the Powheg and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO generators, which show sensitivity to the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements, are tuned to the data.

This note is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the data sets used, the parameters of models, and the methodology of the parameter optimisation. Section 3 shows the sensitivity of the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements to theMC parameter variations. Sections 4 and 5 present tunes of the parameters governing ISR and FSR, respectively. Section 6 presents a simultaneous tune of the ISR and FSR parameters. Sections 7 and 8 show the application of the Pythia8 tune to the \(t\bar{t}\) data to the NLO+PS generators MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Powheg. Section 9 summarises the results.

## 2 Methodology

Three ATLAS measurements at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV are used to constrain the ISR and FSR parameters of the Pythia8 MC: differential \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections as functions of jet multiplicity and jet transverse momentum [6], \(t\bar{t}\) production with a veto on additional central jet activity [4], henceforth referred to as gap-fraction measurements, and jet shapes in \(t\bar{t}\) events [5]. The statistical correlations among the various observables of these \(t\bar{t}\) measurements were not studied, hence a set of observables is chosen, which are sufficiently statistically independent, so as to avoid any bias in the results. In Ref. [6] the \(t\bar{t}\) production cross-section is measured differentially in jet multiplicity and in jet transverse momentum in the single-lepton channel, without explicit separation between jets related to \(t\bar{t}\) decays and additional jets. The jet multiplicity is measured for several different jet transverse momentum thresholds and the cross section with respect to the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is measured separately for the five highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets. The differential cross sections as functions of the leading-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), of the 5th leading-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), of jet multiplicity for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\geqslant 25\) GeV and jet multiplicity for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\geqslant 80\) GeV are used. The overall normalisation of these observables is sensitive to higher-order QCD corrections. In order to reduce the effect of missing higher-order QCD corrections on the minimisation of the MC parameters, the predictions of the \(t\bar{t}\) + jets differential cross sections are normalised to the data, separately for each observable. From Ref. [4], only the inclusive gap fraction as a function of the leading-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold, \(Q_{0}\), is used. This measurement is performed in the dileptonic channel, to ensure that the additional jets can easily be distinguished from the \(t\bar{t}\) decay products. The gap fraction is defined as \(f(Q_{0})=n(Q_{0})/N\) where \(N\) is the number of selected \(t\bar{t}\) events and \(n(Q_{0})\) the fraction of those events that do not contain an additional jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>Q_{0}\) in a central rapidity interval. The inclusive gap fraction as a function of the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets, \(Q_{\mathrm{sum}}\), is considered statistically correlated to the inclusive gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\), and is not used. Differential gap-fraction measurements as a function of rapidity were also measured in Ref. [4], but they are not used in this study, since the parameters of the model do not show sensitivity to the rapidity dependence of the gap fraction. In Ref. [5], the differential and integral jet shapes as a function of the jet radius \(r\) are measured for light- and \(b\)-jets in five exclusive \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges of the jet. Samples of top-quark pair events are selected in both the single-lepton and dilepton final states. The shapes of the jets initiated by bottom-quarks from the top-quark decays are compared with those of the jets originated by light-quarks from the hadronic \(W\) boson decays in the single-lepton channel. Jet shapes are sensitive to the details of the parton-to-jet fragmentation processes, such as the value of \(\alpha_{S}\) used in the branchings of FSR, the fragmentation model and the underlying event. In this study only the differential jet shapes are used. They are defined as the average fraction of transverse momentum contained within an annulus of inner radius \(r_{a}=r-\delta r/2\) and outer radius \(r_{b}=r+\delta r/2\), where \(r\) is measured relative to the jet axis and lies in the range \(\delta r/2\leqslant r\leqslant R-\delta r/2\).

\[\rho(r)=\frac{1}{\delta r}\cdot\frac{1}{N_{\mathrm{jets}}}\cdot\sum_{\mathrm{ jets}}\frac{p_{\mathrm{T}}(r_{a},r_{b})}{p_{\mathrm{T}}(0,R)} \tag{1}\]

\(R\) represents the maximum radius, and is set to 0.4, the radius used in the jet reconstruction algorithm. \(\delta r=0.04\) is the width of the annulus and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(r_{a},r_{b})\) is the scalar sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the jet constituentswith radii between \(r_{a}\) and \(r_{b}\). Recently, another measurement of \(t\bar{t}\) production in \(pp\) collisions has been performed with the ATLAS detector [7], in which differential cross sections are presented in terms of kinematic variables whose dependence on theoretical models is minimal. This measurement, which is not included in this study, is also expected to be sensitive to QCD radiation.

The Pythia8 MC version 8.201 is used throughout this study. The 4C [23] tune with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [24], or the more recent Monash [2] tune with the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set [25] are used as baselines for the parameter optimisation, henceforth referred to as _tuning_. In the Pythia8 MC event generator, the matrix elements for \(t\bar{t}\) production are computed at LO, and supplemented with parton showers. The \(t\bar{t}\) process receives significant corrections at NLO in \(\alpha_{s}\), and such corrections need to be accounted for when performing a tuning of the parton shower parameters to observables in the \(t\bar{t}\) final state. In Ref. [26] it was shown that a modification of the parton shower emission probability with a damping factor can be used to approximate the effect of NLO corrections to the \(t\bar{t}\) production. The ISR emission probability \(\mathcal{P}_{\rm ISR}\) is modified as

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathcal{P}_{\rm ISR}}{\mathrm{d}p_{\rm T}^{2}}\propto\frac{1 }{p_{\rm T}^{2}}\,\frac{k^{2}M^{2}}{k^{2}M^{2}+p_{\rm T}^{2}} \tag{2}\]

where \(p_{\rm T}\) is the transverse momentum evolution variable, as defined in Ref. [27], \(M\) is the factorisation scale, which is set to the smaller of the squared transverse masses of the two outgoing particles, and \(k\) is a fudge factor of order unity, which corresponds to the tunable parameter \(p_{\rm T,damp}^{\rm ISR}\). The scale \(k\cdot M\) corresponds to a transition from the \(1/p_{\rm T}^{2}\) to the \(1/p_{\rm T}^{4}\) behaviour in the probability of ISR emission.

Four parameters of the Pythia8 parton shower model are studied and tuned to the data: two ISR parameters correspond to the value of the strong-coupling constant at the mass of the \(Z\) boson for ISR, \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm ISR}(m_{Z})\), and the fudge factor for the damping of the ISR radiation, \(p_{\rm T,damp}^{\rm ISR}\), and two FSR parameters are the value of \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm FSR}(m_{Z})\) and the infrared cut-off \(p_{\rm T,min}^{\rm FSR}\). A similar fudge factor for the damping of the FSR radiation, \(p_{\rm T,damp}^{\rm FSR}\), has been considered, but the data does not show sensitivity to this parameter. Higher-order corrections can be partially absorbed in the effective values of \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm ISR}(m_{Z})\) and \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm FSR}(m_{Z})\). However the structure of higher-order splitting kernels differs between ISR and FSR [9], hence the \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm ISR}(m_{Z})\) and \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm FSR}(m_{Z})\) parameters are allowed to assume different values in the tuning. The strategy followed in this study is to first perform independent tuning of the ISR and FSR parameters: the results of these tunes can be compared to previous tunes to test the universality of the model separately for ISR and FSR. Later, a simultaneous tune of ISR and FSR is performed, which accounts for the interplay between the ISR and FSR parameters. Whereas the values of \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm ISR}(m_{Z})\), \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm FSR}(m_{Z})\), and \(p_{\rm T,min}^{\rm FSR}\) are expected to be process-independent parameters of the Pythia8 parton shower model, the value of \(p_{\rm T,damp}^{\rm ISR}\) is expected to be process-specific. Moreover, the damping of the ISR emission probability should be used only when showering LO \(t\bar{t}\) matrix-element calculations, and disabled by setting SpaceShower:pTdampMatch=0 when Pythia8 is interfaced to NLO \(t\bar{t}\) or multi-leg \(t\bar{t}\)+jets MC generators.

After tuning the ISR and FSR parameters to the \(t\bar{t}\) data, the resulting Pythia8 tune is used with the NLO+PS generators Powheg v2-r2915 [19, 20, 21, 28] and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.2.2 [22]. The CT10nlo PDF set [29] is used in both Powheg and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. The renormalisation and factorisation scales in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO are set to the sum of the transverse masses of the top and the antitop. In Powheg they are set at the generator default value \(Q\), defined as \(Q=\sqrt{m_{t}^{2}+p_{\rm T}^{2}}\), where \(m_{t}\) and \(p_{\rm T}\) are the top quark mass and the top quark transverse momentum evaluated for the underlying Born configuration (i.e. before radiation). In the Powheg generator, it is possible to introduce a damping factor \[F=\frac{\texttt{hdamp}^{2}}{p_{\text{T}}^{2}+\texttt{hdamp}^{2}} \tag{3}\]

to the singular part of the real radiation [30], where \(p_{\text{T}}\) is the transverse momentum of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. The hdamp parameter is parametrised as \(\texttt{hdamp}=h\cdot m_{t}\), and the factor \(h\) is tuned to the \(t\bar{t}\) data. Previous studies showed that values of \(h\) between one and two lead to a good description of QCD radiation in \(t\bar{t}\) events [31; 32]. The starting scale of the parton shower is set to the \(p_{\text{T}}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. In the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO generator, it is possible to change the upper scale for the MC subtraction term, which corresponds to the starting scale of the parton shower [22]. The upper scale for the MC subtraction term is set as a fraction of a reference scale, which corresponds to the invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. The parameters frac_upp and frac_low, determine the minimum and maximum fractions, respectively, of the reference scale, which are used as an upper limit for the MC subtraction term. The parameters frac_upp and frac_low are set to \(\texttt{frac\_upp}=\texttt{frac\_low}=f\), the sensitivity of the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements to the \(f\) parameter is studied, and the optimal value is extracted from the data. Unlike the parton shower parameters \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{ISR}}(m_{Z})\), \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{FSR}}(m_{Z})\), and \(p_{\text{T,min}}^{\text{FSR}}\), the parameters hdamp, frac_upp and frac_low are expected to be process dependent, and the results obtained are specific to \(t\bar{t}\) production. In the tuning of the hdamp parameter in Powheg, and of the frac_upp and frac_low parameters in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, the Pythia8 parton shower parameters are fixed to the values obtained by tuning Pythia8 to the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements. This is based on the assumption that the effective values of \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{ISR}}(m_{Z})\) and \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{FSR}}(m_{Z})\) are not significantly affected by the inclusion of the NLO corrections to the calculations of the matrix elements of the \(pp\to t\bar{t}\) process. Tables 1 and 2 show the parameters, the corresponding MC settings, and the ranges considered in the tuning for Pythia8 and for the NLO+PS generators, respectively.

The tuning is performed using Professor v1.4 [33] for the fit to the data, and Rivet v2.2.0 [34] for the implementation of the measurements. The method implemented in Professor permits the simultaneous tuning of several parameters by using an analytic approximation for the dependence of the physical observables on the model parameters, an idea first introduced in Ref. [13]. Polynomials of third-order are used to parametrise the response of the observables to the generator parameters, the coefficients in the polynomials are obtained by fitting MC predictions generated at a set of randomly selected parameter points, called anchor points. The number of anchor points used is 50 for one-parameter tuning, 100 for two-parameters tuning, and 400 for four-parameters tuning, with \(2\cdot 10^{6}\) dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) events and \(10^{7}\) semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events generated at each point. The optimal values of the model parameters are obtained with a standard \(\chi^{2}\) minimisation of the analytic approximation to the corresponding data using MINUIT [35].

The MC statistical uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated and included in the definition of the \(\chi^{2}\) function. For the first time in the context of parton shower tuning in MC simulations, the correlation of the experimental uncertainties is included in the \(\chi^{2}\) minimisation. In presence of correlations, the \(\chi^{2}\) function is defined as:

\[\chi^{2}=(\vec{x}-\vec{\mu})^{T}C^{-1}(\vec{x}-\vec{\mu}) \tag{4}\]

where \(\vec{x}\) is the vector of data, \(\vec{\mu}\) the interpolated MC prediction and \(C\) the covariance matrix of the data. Each source of systematic uncertainty is treated as fully correlated across the bins of each observable, and across the various observables of each of the three \(t\bar{t}\) measurements. The measurement of the gap fraction has also a significant bin-to-bin statistical correlation, which is considered in the definition of the covariance matrix \(C\). The MC statistical uncertainty of the \(t\bar{t}\) +jets measurement is considered uncorrelated across bins.

## 3 Sensitivity study

As a first step in the process of tuning the MC to the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements, a study of the sensitivity of the various observables to the parameters is performed. The results of the sensitivity study can guide the selection of the observables to use for tuning the ISR and FSR parameters, respectively, and the parameters of the NLO+PS generators.

The sensitivity of each observable bin to a set of parameters \(p_{i}\), is estimated from the interpolated response of the observables to the parameters, with the following formula:

\[S_{i}=\frac{\partial MC(\vec{p})}{|MC(p_{0})|+\epsilon w_{MC}}\frac{|p_{0,i}|+ \epsilon w_{p_{i}}}{\partial p_{i}} \tag{5}\]

where \(p_{0}\) is the centre of the parameters range, \(MC(p_{0})\) is the interpolated MC prediction at \(p_{0}\) and the \(\epsilon\) terms, set to 1% of the parameter range are introduced to avoid the ill defined case \(MC(p_{0})=0\), \(\partial p_{i}=0\). \(w_{p_{i}}\) corresponds to 80% of the original sampling range and is used to construct \(w_{MC}\).

Figure 1 shows the sensitivity of the differential \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections as functions of jet multiplicity and jet transverse momentum, and of the gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\), to the Pythia8 parton shower parameters. Both measurements are mostly sensitive to the ISR parameters \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm ISR}(m_{Z})\) and \(p_{\rm T,damp}^{\rm ISR}\), and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \hline \hline  & Powheg setting & Variation range & default \\ \hline Real radiation damping & hdamp = \(h\cdot m_{t}\) & \(0.5\cdot m_{t}-4.0\cdot m_{t}\) & \(\infty\) \\ \hline  & MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO setting & & \\ \hline Upper limit of the MC subtraction term & frac\_low = frac\_upp = \(f\) & \(0.2-1.0\) & frac\_low = 0.1 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The sensitivities are shown as functions of (a) jet multiplicity for jets with \(p_{\rm T}\mathrm{jet}\geqslant 25\) GeV, (b) jet multiplicity for jets with \(p_{\rm T}\mathrm{jet}\geqslant 80\) GeV, (c) leading-jet transverse momentum, (d) 5th-leading jet transverse momentum, and (e) gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\).

to less extent to the FSR parameter \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{FSR}}(m_{Z})\). Figure 2 shows the sensitivity of the light-jet shapes to the Pythia8 parton shower parameters. The light-jet shapes are mostly sensitive to the FSR parameter \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{FSR}}(m_{Z})\), some sensitivity is observed also to the FSR parameter \(p_{\text{T,min}}^{\text{FSR}}\) and to the ISR parameter \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{ISR}}(m_{Z})\). Similar sensitivities are observed for the \(b\)-jet shapes.

Based on the results of the sensitivity study, the differential \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections as functions of jet multiplicity and jet transverse momentum, and the gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\) are used to study the consistency of the ISR parameters with previous tunes to the \(Z\) boson transverse momentum, whereas the jet-shapes are used to study the consistency of the FSR parameters with previous tunes to the LEP measurements. However, the sensitivity study also shows that the ISR and FSR parameters are not completely decoupled: the observables sensitive to the ISR parameters have some sensitivity to \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{FSR}}(m_{Z})\), and the observables used to tune the FSR parameters have some sensitivity to \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{ISR}}(m_{Z})\). To account for such an interplay between ISR and FSR parameters, a simultaneous tune of ISR and FSR parameters is performed using all the measurements.

Figure 3 shows the sensitivity of the differential \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections as functions of jet multiplicity and jet transverse momentum, and of the gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\), to the \(h\) and \(f\) parameters of Powheg and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. The light- and \(b\)-jet shapes have negligible sensitivity to the \(h\) and \(f\) parameters, hence only the \(t\bar{t}\) + jets differential cross sections and the \(t\bar{t}\) gap fraction measurement are used in the tuning of these parameters.

## 4 Initial-state radiation

As shown in the previous section, the differential \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections as functions of jet multiplicity and jet transverse momentum, and the gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\), are sensitive to the ISR parameters \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{ISR}}(m_{Z})\) and \(p_{\text{T,damp}}^{\text{ISR}}\). While the fudge factor for the damping of ISR, \(p_{\text{T,damp}}^{\text{ISR}}\), is introduced in the specific case of the \(t\bar{t}\) production to compensate for missing matrix-element corrections in the Pythia8 MC [23], the \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{ISR}}(m_{Z})\) parameter is expected to be universal across different processes. In particular, by comparing the value constrained in \(t\bar{t}\) production, to the value preferred by the transverse momentum spectrum of \(Z\) bosons produced in \(pp\) collisions [10], the validity of the ISR parton shower model can be tested in processes dominated by different initial states: gluon-gluon for \(t\bar{t}\) production and quark-antiquark for \(Z\) production. Table 3 shows the results of the tuning of the ISR parameters to the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements using the 4C tune as baseline. The results are compared to the AZ tune to the \(Z\) boson transverse momentum spectrum [10], which was performed using the same 4C tune as baseline, and the same CTEQ6L1 PDF set.

The sensitivities are shown as functions of the light-jet radius \(r\) for jets with (a) \(30<p_{\rm T}{}^{\rm jet}<40\)  GeV, (b) \(40<p_{\rm T}{}^{\rm jet}<50\)  GeV, (c) \(50<p_{\rm T}{}^{\rm jet}<70\)  GeV, (d) \(70<p_{\rm T}{}^{\rm jet}<100\)  GeV, and (e) \(100<p_{\rm T}{}^{\rm jet}<150\)  GeV.

The sensitivities are shown as functions of the differential \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections as functions of (a) jet multiplicity for jets with \({p_{\rm T}}^{\rm jet}\geqslant 25\) GeV, (b) jet multiplicity for jets with \({p_{\rm T}}^{\rm jet}\geqslant 80\) GeV, (c) leading-jet transverse momentum, (d) 5th-leading jet transverse momentum, and (e) gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\).

multiplicity and jet transverse momentum, and to the gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\), show very similar results for the optimised parameters. The value of \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm ISR}(m_{Z})\) obtained from the tune to both measurements is in rather good agreement with the value of the AZ tune. Figure 4 shows the comparison between the optimal values of the ISR tunes to the \(t\bar{t}\) data and the AZ tune, which is constrained to the ATLAS measurement of the \(Z\) boson transverse momentum at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The 68% confidence interval in the \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm ISR}(m_{Z})\) and \(p_{\rm T,damp}^{\rm ISR}\) space is obtained from the Hessian matrix of the \(\chi^{2}\) at the minimum.

Table 4 shows the results of the tuning of the ISR parameters to the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements using the Monash tune as baseline and the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF set. The optimal values of the ISR parameters obtained using Monash as the baseline tune are slightly different to those obtained with 4C, and the value of the \(\chi^{2}\) is up to six points better in the case of Monash.

Monash tunes, respectively. Although the addition of \(p_{\rm T,min}^{\rm FSR}\) as a free parameter restored compatibility in the value of \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm FSR}(m_{Z})\) between the tunes to the light-jet shapes in \(t\bar{t}\) events, and the tunes based on LEP event shapes, the resulting higher values of \(p_{\rm T,min}^{\rm FSR}\) leave an undesirable gap between the FSR cut-off and the scale of hadronisation [2]. Indeed, the scale of the \(p_{\rm T}\) kicks involved in string breaking of the Pythia8 hadronisation model (corresponding to the StringPT:sigma parameter) is set to \(\sigma_{\perp}=0.304\) GeV in the 4C tune, and \(\sigma_{\perp}=0.335\) GeV in the Monash tune. The result of \(p_{\rm T,min}^{\rm FSR}\) is also incompatible with the determination of this parameter from LEP data of Ref. [36], which is 0.41 GeV. The difference in the preferred values of \(p_{\rm T,min}^{\rm FSR}\) suggests that there is a residual tension between the light-jet shapes in \(t\bar{t}\) events and the LEP event shapes. Further studies on the impact of changing parameters of the fragmentation function, of different colour reconnection models [37], and of NLO corrections in \(W\) boson hadronic decays [38], could cast light on the nature of such a tension.

The tune of the FSR parameters to the light-jet shapes in \(t\bar{t}\) events, with the Monash tune as baseline, shown in Table 8, is referred to as ATTBAR-FSR. Figure 6 shows the measurements of light-jet shapes in \(t\bar{t}\) events, compared to the Pythia8 predictions with the Monash and ATTBAR-FSR tunes. The \(b\)-jet shapes differential distributions are compared in Fig. 7 to the Pythia8 predictions of the same Monash and ATTBAR-FSR tunes. The comparison shows a mismodelling of the \(b\)-jets shapes, which are predicted to be wider than observed in the data. The mismodelling is more pronounced at high jet \(p_{\rm T}\) above 70 GeV and at large angle \(r\) above 0.1. The NLO corrections in top quark decays, which has been included in Powheg[38], have an impact on the \(b\)-quark fragmentation function, and could improve the agreement between the measurements and the predictions.

## 6 Simultaneous tune of ISR and FSR

As observed in Section 3, the observables used for tuning the ISR parameters have some sensitivity to \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm FSR}(m_{Z})\), and the observables used to tune the FSR parameters have some sensitivity to \(\alpha_{s}^{\rm ISR}(m_{Z})\). To account for the interplay between ISR and FSR parameters, a simultaneous tune of ISR and FSR

The variations of the ISR and FSR parameters induce a change in the overall energy and particle flow, which affects the underlying event activity. Measurements of the underlying event in the \(t\bar{t}\) final state could be used to tune the multi-parton-interaction (MPI) parameters, but only a measurement from CMS was performed [39], which is a preliminary result. Assuming that the MPI model can describe simultaneously both \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\) boson production, the change in the energy and particle flow is compensated by adjusting the MPI cut-off to match the inclusive charged particle production and energy flow in \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) underlying event data measured by ATLAS at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [40]. The MPI cut-off in ATBAR is changed from 2.28 GeV, the value in the Monash tune, to 2.16 GeV. The same value of the MPI cut-off is used also for the NLO+PS predictions.

global-recoil configuration, and predictions with the ATTBAR-MG5aMCNLO tune.

Although the global-recoil configuration is theoretically more consistent, the \(\chi^{2}_{\rm min}\) of the tuning for the local-recoil configuration is up to 17 points lower, and the agreement with the data is significantly better in the gap-fraction measurement, and in the 5th jet bin of the differential cross section as a function of jet multiplicity for jets with \(p_{\rm T}\geqslant 25\)\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). The modeling of the first radiation includes fixed-order and all-order effects. For the current configuration of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 Monte Carlo generator it is not obvious which of these effects is responsible for the difference between the global and local recoil strategies.

## 8 Tune of the Powheg generator

The simultaneous ISR and FSR Pythia8 tune to the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements, ATTBAR, is applied to the Powheg generator, with the exception of the \(p_{\rm T,\,dump}^{\rm ISR}\) parameter, and the hdamp factor of Powheg is tuned to the \(t\bar{t}\) data. The hdamp factor is parametrised as hdamp\(=h\cdot m_{t}\), and the optimal value of \(h\) is obtained by tuning the Powheg+Pythia8 prediction to the differential \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections as functions of jet multiplicity and jet transverse momentum, and to the gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\).

Table 15 shows the results of the tuning of the \(h\) parameter to the differential \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections as functions of jet multiplicity and jet transverse momentum, and to the gap fraction as a function of \(Q_{0}\), using the ATTBAR tune. The value of \(h\) obtained by tuning to the \(t\bar{t}\) + jets measurements is consistent with the value obtained by tuning to the \(t\bar{t}\) gap fraction, with the latter having larger uncertainty. The value of \(h\), obtained by tuning to both measurements, is \(h=1.8^{+0.4}_{-0.3}\), which corresponds to hdamp\(~{}=~{}310^{+70}_{-50}\)\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), and this tune is referred to as ATTBAR-POWHEG. Figure 10 shows the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements compared to the Powheg+Pythia8 predictions with the Monash and ATTBAR-POWHEG tunes.

## 9 Summary and conclusions

Figures 11, 12, 13, and 14 show Pythia8 predictions with the ATTBAR tune, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 predictions with the ATTBAR-MG5aMCNLO tune, and Powheg+Pythia8 predictions with the ATBAR-POWHEG tune, compared to the ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\) measurements. Table 16 summarises the settings of the ATTBAR tunes for the Pythia8, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8, and Powheg+Pythia8 generators.

Independent tunes of ISR and FSR parameters of the Pythia8 MC to the ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\) measurements, and a simultaneous tune of the ISR and FSR parameters have been performed. The latter tune, named ATTBAR, is in very good agreement with the data. The value of \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{ISR}}(m_{Z})\) tuned to the \(t\bar{t}\) data is in good agreement with previous tunes to the \(Z\) boson transverse momentum distribution measured by ATLAS [10], and the value of \(\alpha_{s}^{\text{FSR}}(m_{Z})\) is in good agreement with tunes to the LEP event shapes in \(Z\) boson hadronic decays [11, 12, 13, 14]. The value of \(p_{\text{T,min}}^{\text{FSR}}\) preferred by the tunes to the \(t\bar{t}\) light-jet shapes is at the level of 1 GeV, which is significantly higher than the values used in the 4C and Monash tunes of about 0.5 GeV, and in disagreement with the determination of this parameter from LEP data [36]. Measurements of \(t\bar{t}\)\(b\)-jet shapes are not well described by the Pythia8 MC, which predicts wider shapes than observed in the data. Significant disagreement with the data is observed in the region of \(p_{\text{T}}\geqslant 70\) GeV and \(r\geqslant 0.1\). Variations of the parameters considered in this study cannot account for the tension between the data and the predictions.

The ATTBAR tune is applied to the NLO+PS generators Powheg and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, and the sensitivity of the \(t\bar{t}\) measurements to additional parameters of these generators is studied. A reasonable agreement of the Powheg+Pythia8 predictions to the \(t\bar{t}\) data is achieved by lowering the hdamp parameter, and the optimal value preferred by the data is \(1.8\cdot m_{t}\). The sensitivity of the \(t\bar{t}\) data to the upper scale of the subtraction term, \(f=\text{frac\_low}=\text{frac\_upper}\), of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is studied. In order to match the subtraction term of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, the Pythia8 FSR should be performed with a global recoil strategy. However, the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 generator with the global recoil strategy for FSR predicts too high cross sections for \(t\bar{t}+\geqslant 5\) jets with \(p_{\text{T}}\geqslant 25\) GeV, and too small gap fraction probabilities for a leading jet in the range \(25\leqslant p_{\text{T}}\leqslant 100\) GeV, as shown in Fig. 9. Such a disagreement is not observed when using the local recoil strategy for FSR.

The use of the uncertainties correlation in the tuning procedure gives a proper statistical meaning to the parameters values and their uncertainties, and provides a significant reduction of the parameters uncertainties.
