## 1 Pure WIMP Dark Matter triplet

A fermionic triplet \(\chi\) of the \(SU(2)_{L}\) group with null hypercharge (\(Y\)),

\[\chi=\left(\begin{array}{c}\chi^{+}\\ \chi_{0}\\ \chi^{-}\end{array}\right) \tag{1}\]

is added to the SM with a Lagrangian:

\[\mathcal{L}_{MDM} = \frac{1}{2}\,\bar{\chi}(i\not{D}+M)\,\chi\] \[= \frac{1}{2}\,\bar{\chi}_{0}(i\not{\partial}-M_{\chi^{0}})\,\chi_{ 0}+\bar{\chi^{+}}(i\not{\partial}-M_{\chi^{+}})\,\chi^{+}\] \[+ g(\bar{\chi^{+}}\gamma_{\mu}\chi^{+}(\sin\theta_{W}A_{\mu}+\cos \theta_{W}Z_{\mu}))+\bar{\chi^{+}}\gamma_{\mu}\chi_{0}W_{\mu}^{-}+\bar{\chi}_{ 0}\gamma_{\mu}\chi^{+}W_{\mu}^{+}\]

where \(g\) is the \(SU(2)\) gauge coupling; \(M\) is the tree-level mass of the particle; \(\sin\theta_{W}\) and \(\cos\theta_{W}\) are the sine and cosine of the Weinberg angle; \(A_{\mu}\), \(Z_{\mu}\), \(W_{\mu}\) are the SM boson fields. The lightest component of the triplet is stable if some extra symmetry is imposed, like lepton number, baryon minus lepton number (B-L) or a new symmetry under which \(\chi\) is charged (e.g. R-parity in SUSY).

At tree level all the \(\chi\) components have the same mass, but a mass splitting is induced by the electroweak corrections given by loops of SM gauge bosons between the charged and neutral components of \(\chi\). These corrections make the charged components heavier than the neutral one. The neutral component (\(\chi_{0}\)) is therefore the lightest one and its mass differs by \(\simeq\) 165 MeV [1] from the one of the charged components. Being neutral and stable, \(\chi_{0}\) constitutes a potential DM candidate. If the thermal relic abundance is assumed, the mass of \(\chi_{0}\) is \(M_{\chi_{0}}\simeq 3\) TeV. However, if \(\chi\) is not the only particle making the whole dark matter or if it is not thermally produced [2], its mass can be \(M_{\chi_{0}}<\)3 TeV.

This model provides a benchmark of a typical WIMP DM candidate and its phenomenology recreates the one of supersymmetric models where the Wino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). For this reason this triplet is referred to as _Wino-like_. Together with providing a good DM candidate, this Wino-like triplet has other interesting features, for instance it modifies the running of the Higgs quartic coupling stabilizing the electroweak vacuum. It also changes the running of the gauge couplings helping with their unification. As studied in Ref. [3], treating \(M\) as a free parameter, this triplet can be probed at the LHC in different ways. Once produced, the charged components of the triplet decay into the lightest neutral component \(\chi_{0}\) plus very soft charged pions. \(\chi_{0}\) is identified as \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) in the detector while the pions, because of the small mass splitting between the neutral and charged components, are so soft that they are lost and are not reconstructed. Therefore, the production of \(\chi\) can be searched for by:

* mono-X searches, such as mono-jet (see also Ref. [4]) and mono-photon;
* VBF +\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) searches as \(\chi\) can also be produced via VBF (see also Ref. [5]);
* disappearing tracks searches: the lifetime of \(\chi^{\pm}\) is about \(\tau\simeq\) 0.2 ns and it corresponds to a decay length at rest \(d=c\tau\simeq 6\) cm, this means that almost all the \(\chi^{\pm}\) particles decay before reaching the detector. However, a small fraction of them can travel enough to leave a track in the detector. In this case, the signature of these events is characterized by high \(p_{T}\) tracks (caused by \(\chi^{\pm}\)) which end inside the detector once they have decayed into \(\chi_{0}\) and soft pions [6].

This document is focused on the VBF production mode and mono-photon final state. They constitute a necessary complement to the mono-jet and disappearing track searches, because of the very different dependencies on the model parameters like the EW representation and the value of the mass splitting. For example, the strong reach of disappearing track searches [7] would be significantly reduced for larger values of the mass splitting because the lifetime scales as the inverse of the third power of the mass splitting. On the other hand, the reach of VBF and mono-photon searches would not be substantially altered because the decay products other than \(\chi^{0}\) would still be too soft for our vetos, see e.g. [8]. Furthermore, the mono-photon final state provides a complementary channel with respect to the mono-jet one as the mono-jet signature arises from initial state radiation while in case of the mono-photon the radiation can also be emitted from an intermediate \(W\) boson or \(\chi^{\pm}\) particle.

LEP limits exclude masses below \(\sim\)90 GeV [9; 10; 11], therefore we focus on \(M_{\chi_{0}}\geq\)90 GeV.

## 2 The LHC, HL-LHC and the ATLAS detector

The expected luminosity that will be collected at the end of run-2 is estimated to be \(\sim\)150 fb\({}^{-1}\)(end of 2018) with an instantaneous luminosity of \(\sim\)1.5\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and an average number of collisions per bunch crossing \(<\mu>\sim 30\). The run-2 will be followed by a long shutdown (2019-2020). Collisions will restart in early 2021, in the so-called run-3. During this run, the instantaneous luminosity will increase up to \(\sim\)2\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and \(<\mu>\) is expected to be \(\sim\) 60. The amount of data which is expected at the end of run-3 corresponds to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). An increase of the centre-of-mass-energy to \(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV is foreseen.

The HL LHC will start after 2025. The centre-of-mass-energy will be \(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV for an instantaneous luminosity of 7.5\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and the aim is to achieve \(\sim\)3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of total integrated luminosity per experiment in 10 years of running time. The pile-up will increase substantially with an expected \(<\mu>\) growing to \(\sim 200\). This implies the necessity of developing techniques able to mitigate it in order to perform physics analysis.The ATLAS detector and the trigger system will undergo several upgrades to collect data during the HL-LHC [12; 13].

In this note projections corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) are presented for analyses performed with run-2 data [14; 15], this allows to exploit the full complexity of run-2 analyses. The upgrades of the detector are expected to lead to a better background rejection, while the different pile-up conditions will constitute a challenge, as shown in Sec. 5.2 for the VBF+\(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) analysis.

## 3 Simulation setup

EW triplet DM signal generation for mono-photon and VBF plus \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) analyses

The model has been implemented in FeynRules 2.3.24 [16] and considers the electroweak triplet \(\chi=(\chi^{+},\chi_{0},\chi^{-})\) described in Sec. 1. This model implementation is the same that has also been used for the phenomenological studies in Ref. [3]. MadGraph [17; 18; 19] at Leading Order (LO) has been used to generate the hard-scatter process. Madgraph is then interfaced to Pythia8 [20], with the parameter values set according to the ATLAS tune A14 [21], for parton shower, hadronization and underlying event simulation. The parton distribution function (PDF) set used is NNPDF2.3 at leading order (LO) [22].

For the mono-photon analysis, events with a pair of \(\chi\) and one final state \(\gamma\) with at least \(E_{T}^{\gamma}\)=130 GeV are generated. For the VBF+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) analysis, events with a pair of \(\chi\) and two final state partons with transverse momentum \(p_{T}>\)40 GeV, pseudorapidity separation \(\Delta\eta>\)3 and invariant mass of at least 500 GeV have been generated at the matrix-element level. Some Feynman diagrams for the two processes are shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2 respectively. Notice that, for the VBF+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) analysis, also diagrams not properly originating from two vector bosons (in contrast to pure VBF processes) contribute to the signal (and also background) events as those diagrams produce a jets+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) signature where the jets have large pseudorapidity separation. In particular, all the diagrams generated from processes with a final state pair of \(\chi\) particles and two quarks, passing the generator level selections listed above, are included as part of the signal. Cross sections, computed at \(\sqrt{s}=\)13 and 14 TeV for comparisons, for different values of the \(\chi_{0}\) mass, are shown in table 1 and 2 for the mono-photon and VBF+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) final states respectively. Only samples generated at \(\sqrt{s}=\)13 TeV have been used in the analyses described in Sec. 4 and Sec. 5.1, the cross sections at \(\sqrt{s}=\) 14 TeV are only listed for reference to show the relative change due to the increase in the center-of-mass energy.

Signal samples have been simulated for different values of \(\chi_{0}\) mass with the official ATLASFAST-II simulation of the current detector [23] at \(\sqrt{s}=\)13 TeV. For the mono-photon analysis Monte Carlo (MC) samples have been simulated for \(\chi_{0}\) masses ranging from 90 GeV to 1 TeV, while for the VBF+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) analysis, a scan of \(\chi_{0}\) mass has been performed in the range 90-200 GeV.

### Datasets for pile-up studies

To investigate the realistic conditions for the HL-LHC, a study using the VBF+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) topology employs a full simulation of the upgraded ATLAS detector with \(<\mu>=200\) and at \(\sqrt{s}\)=14 TeV. The main

background1 for the VBF \(H\to\) invisible search is the strong production of \(Z\)+jets, where the \(Z\) decays to neutrinos. Event samples of VBF \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to\nu\bar{\nu}\nu\bar{\nu}\) and strong production of \(Z\)+jets are generated at \(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV with Powheg-Box v1_r2856 [24, 25, 26, 27, 28] using the CT10 [29] PDF set and interfaced with Pythia8 v8.186 [20, 30]. The invisible Higgs event sample further includes EvtGen (v1.2.0) [31] and uses the AZNLOCTEQL1 [32] set of tuned parameters for Pythia 8. The cross-section for this signal sample is 4.32 fb. In the run-2 analysis, there is also a non-negligible contribution of \(ggH\) production (about 15%); this is ignored in the results presented in Sec. 5.2 as it does not qualitatively change the conclusions. The \(Z\)+jets event sample additionally includes PhotosPP [33] and uses the AU2 [34] set of tuned parameters for Pythia 8. Detector simulation including digitization uses a full simulation based on Geant 4 [35, 36]. The detector geometry includes the upgraded ATLAS inner tracker (ITk) [37, 38] with five barrel pixel layers and four barrel strip layers. Pythia 8 minimum bias events are overlaid on top of each hard-scatter event to simulate pile-up.

## 4 Mono-Photon final state

The mono-photon analysis is characterized by a relatively clean final state, containing a photon with a high transverse energy and large \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), which can be mimicked by few SM processes. The run-2 search for new phenomena performed in mono-photon events in pp collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV at the LHC, using data collected by the ATLAS experiment in 2015 and 2016 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\)[15], has shown no deviations from the SM expectations. The mono-photon search has been interpreted in terms of the pure WIMP triplet model described in Sec. 1 at high luminosity by keeping the same event selection and the same strategy for the background estimates to exploit the full complexity of the analysis.

The dominant backgrounds consist in processes with a Z or W boson produced in association with a photon, mainly Z(\(\rightarrow\nu\nu\)) + \(\gamma\) and processes containing a photon with associated jets, \(\gamma\)+jets. They are estimated by normalizing the MC prediction for those backgrounds with factors obtained from a simultaneous fitting technique, based on control regions built by reverting one or more cuts of the signal region such that one type of process becomes dominant in that region. Other subleading backgrounds, like W/Z + jet, top and diboson, in which electrons or jets can fake photons are estimated with data-driven techniques and their contribution obtained with 2015 and 2016 data, is rescaled to the high luminosity scenario.

Events passing the lowest unprescaled single photon trigger are selected requiring \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>150\) GeV. The leading photon has to satisfy the "tight" identification criteria and is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}>\)150 GeV, \(|\eta|<2.37\) and to be isolated. The photon and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) are required to be well separated, with \(\Delta\phi(\gamma,\ E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})>0.4\). Finally, events are required to have no electrons or muons and no more than one jet with \(\Delta\phi(\mathrm{jet},\ E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})>0.4\). Five signal regions (SRs) are defined corresponding to different \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) ranges. The run-2 analysis shows that the total background prediction uncertainty, including systematic and statistical contributions varies from 6.1% to 13.5% for the various SRs, dominated by the statistical uncertainty in the control regions which varies from approximately 4.3% to 10.4%. The largest systematic uncertainties are due to the uncertainty in the rate of fake photons from jets and to the uncertainty in the jet energy scale. Exclusion limits have been set on the production cross section of DM models using a one-sided profile likelihood ratio and the CLs technique [39; 40] with the asymptotic approximation[41]. In the run-2 analysis, a multiple-bin fit has been performed on the expected \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions of the signal samples by combining the information from the three SRs with increasing \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) ranges. Model independent limits on the fiducial cross section, defined as \(\sigma\times A\), where \(A\) is the acceptance, have been obtained using inclusive SRs with increasing \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) thresholds in order to provide useful constraints on new physics which can be re-interpreted in terms of signal models not covered by this study.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline \(\chi_{0}\) mass [GeV] & Signal Efficiency [\%] \\ \hline
90 & 36.6 \(\pm\) 0.5 \\
100 & 36.7 \(\pm\) 0.5 \\
200 & 38.2 \(\pm\) 0.5 \\

\end{table}
Table 3: Summary of signal efficiencies for different values of \(\chi^{0}\) masses for the mono-photon analysis in the SR.

The reinterpretation of mono-photon search in the context of the pure WIMP triplet model uses the full simulated MC signal samples described in Sec. 3. The simultaneous fit is performed on the most inclusive SR, corresponding to \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>\)150 GeV, that gives the best expected sensitivity as this model provides a medium-low \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution for the various signal samples studied. All background samples, including fake photons estimated with data-driven techniques, have been included in the fit rescaling the run-2 estimates to the high luminosity scenario. For an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), the number of background events in the SR before any fit is 217400 \(\pm\) 7600, where the error is statistical only. The pre-fit distribution of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) for the dominant backgrounds and some signals is shown in Figure 3. All the systematic uncertainties on the MC background samples have been taken into account to obtain projections of the expected upper limits on the \(\chi_{0}\) at 95% CL for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)and \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, that are shown in Figure 4. The expected limit is obtained from a fit to the so-called Asimov dataset [41], with the signal and all backgrounds scaled to their predicted values. Masses of \(\chi_{0}\) below 310 GeV can be excluded at 95% CL by the analysis assuming the same systematic uncertainties adopted in Ref. [15]. For an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\), corresponding to the run-2 analysis, masses of \(\chi_{0}\) below 50 GeV could be excluded. A sensitivity to masses above 90 GeV, which corresponds to the current limit by LEP, can be reached only with the increased luminosity provided by the HL-LHC scenario.

The impact of the systematic uncertainty on the sensitivity of the analysis has been checked considering that the analysis will no more be limited by the statistical uncertainty at high luminosity. In a scenario in which the current systematic uncertainties are halved, an exclusion of \(\chi_{0}\) masses up to about 340 GeV could be reached. Thanks to the increased statistics, the analysis at high luminosity could be further optimized by performing a multiple-bin fit, thus on more bins in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) improving the overall sensitivity of the analysis.

The increase in the \(\sqrt{s}\) from 13 TeV to 14 TeV has not been taken into account: the cross section of the signals close to exclusion are expected to increase by \(\sim\)20% (see table 1), while those of the main \(Z\rightarrow\nu\nu+\gamma\) background are expected to increase by \(\sim\)10-15% leading to a slight increase in the signal significance.

Figure 3: Pre-fit distribution of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) for the dominant backgrounds W/Z+\(\gamma\) and \(\gamma\)+jets and some signal samples in the SR corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). Subleading backgrounds, estimated in run-2 analysis with data-driven techniques, are not included.

## 5 VBF plus \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) final state

The VBF+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) topology is characterized by two quark-initiated jets with a large separation in rapidity and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). In analogy to the mono-photon result presented in the previous section, the sensitivity of the VBF+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) analysis to the pure WIMP triplet model is presented in Sec. 5.1 as a reinterpretation of the run-2 results for the high luminosity scenario foreseen for the HL-LHC. As pile-up is a key experimental challenge for event reconstruction in the VBF topology at the HL-LHC, a dedicated study of its impact is shown in Sec. 5.2 using VBH \(H\rightarrow\)invisible as benchmark.

### Projections at high luminosity for DM for EW triplet DM

As the mass splitting \(\Delta M\) between \(\chi^{\pm}\) and \(\chi_{0}\) is small (\(\Delta M\sim\) 165 MeV), the \(\chi^{\pm}\) particles decay into \(\chi_{0}\) and very soft pions, which are not reconstructed and are lost in the detector. Therefore the signature of a triplet produced via VBF is defined by the presence of two energetic jets, largely separated in pseudorapidity, with \(\mathcal{O}\)(1) TeV invariant mass, and large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) coming from the DM particles. A search for an invisibly decaying Higgs boson produced via VBF has been performed by ATLAS using a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision at \(\sqrt{s}=\)13 TeV [14]. The final state is defined by the presence of two energetic jets, largely separated in pseudorapidity and with \(\mathcal{O}\)(1) TeV invariant mass, and large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) coming from the invisible particles from the Higgs decay. This analysis set limits on the Branching Ratio (\(\mathcal{B}\)) of the Higgs boson decaying into invisible particles. The main

Figure 4: Expected upper limits at 95% CL on the production cross section of \(\chi\) as a function of \(\chi_{0}\) mass in mono-photon final state corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)and assuming the same systematic uncertainties adopted in Ref [15]. The red line shows the theoretical cross section.

backgrounds to this analysis arise from \(Z\to\nu\nu\)+jets and \(W\to\ell\nu\)+jets events. The contribution of \(W/Z\) events is estimated with the following approach: dedicated regions (control regions) enriched in \(W\to\ell\nu\) (where the lepton is found) and \(Z\to\ell\ell^{2}\) events are used to normalize to data the MC estimates using a simultaneous fitting technique and to extrapolate them to the signal region. The multijet background comes from multijet events where large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) is generated mainly by jet mismeasurements. This is highly reduced by a tight \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cut and is estimated via data-driven methods resulting in less than 1% of the total background.

This analysis is reinterpreted in the context of the model described in Sec. 1 for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\): the same selections, background samples and analysis strategy are used to set limits on the cross section of the pure WIMP triplet produced via VBF at an integrated luminosity corresponding to the one which will be reached by HL-LHC. The only selection which has been changed is the separation in pseudorapidity between the two leading jets (\(\Delta\eta(j_{1},j_{2})\)) which has been relaxed from \(\Delta\eta(j_{1},j_{2})>\)4.8 to \(\Delta\eta(j_{1},j_{2})>\)3.5. A relaxed \(\Delta\eta(j_{1},j_{2})\) selection increases the sensitivity to the model as, in addition to the pure VBF Feynman diagrams, also diagrams with strong production contribute to the signal. Therefore, a signal region is defined by selecting events passing the lowest unprescaled \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) trigger, containing no electron and muon, having exactly two jets with transverse momentum \(p_{T}(j_{1})>\)21 nov 80 GeV and \(p_{T}(j_{2})>\) 50 GeV, which are not back to back in the transverse plane (\(\Delta\Phi(j_{1},j_{2})<\)1.8) and which are separated in pseudorapidity (\(\Delta\eta(j_{1},j_{2})>\)3.5). Events are required to have large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) (\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>\)180 GeV), the two leading jets are separated from the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) (\(\Delta\Phi(j_{1},\ E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss})>\)1, \(\Delta\Phi(j_{2},\ E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss})>\)1), the vectorial sum of all the jets (including the pile-up ones) is required to be \(H_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>\)150 GeV and the invariant mass of the dijet system is required to be \(M(j_{1},j_{2})>\)1 TeV. For all the details about jet, electron, muon and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) reconstruction and details about the selection refer to Ref. [14]. As done in the run-2 analysis, the selected events are then split into three categories (_bins_) according to the invariant mass of the dijet system. In particular, the following bins are selected by requiring: 1 TeV\(<M(j_{1},j_{2})<\)1.5 TeV; 1.5 TeV\(<M(j_{1},j_{2})<\)2 TeV; \(M(j_{1},j_{2})>\)2 TeV. Similarly, the control regions enriched in \(W/Z+\) jets processes used in the analysis to constrain the backgrounds, are also split in the same three categories. The same background MC samples that have been used for the run-2 analysis, produced at \(\sqrt{s}=\)13 TeV, have been used for this study by rescaling the luminosity to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), the signal samples used are the ones described in Sec. 3.1. Following the same run-2 strategy, a simultaneous fit in SR and CRs, using the three \(M(j_{1},j_{2})\) bins to increase the signal sensitivity, is used for the \(W/Z+\) jets background estimation and for the limit setting. The signal efficiencies, prior to any fits, for the three values of \(\chi_{0}\) mass considered in the analysis, are shown in table 4 for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The total background, before any fits, in the three bins is respectively 215000\(\pm\)4900; 72000\(\pm\)3300; 48400\(\pm\)1900, where the error is statistical only. Pre-fit distributions of \(\Delta\eta(j_{1},j_{2})\) and \(M(j_{1},j_{2})\), for the total background and the signals, in the inclusive \(M(j_{1},j_{2})>\) 1 TeV SR bin, are shown in Fig. 5.

Exclusion limits are set on the production cross section of the model using a one-sided profile likelihood ratio and the CLs technique [39; 40] with the asymptotic approximation[41].

Experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties have been taken into account and are included in the likelihood as Gaussian-distributed nuisance parameters. Experimental systematic uncertainties include the ones related to the jet energy scale (JES) and resolution (JER), \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) soft term and lepton measurements. The main experimental systematic uncertainties for the run-2 VBF+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) analysis come from JES and JER [42]. At HL, some of the experimental systematic uncertainties are expected to be reduced or become negligible, therefore, for this projection, all the run-2 experimental systematic uncertaintiesFigure 5: Pre-fit distribution of event yields for \(\Delta\eta(j_{1},j_{2})\) (top) and \(M(j_{1},j_{2})\) (bottom) in the signal region (inclusive \(M(j_{1},j_{2})>1\) TeV bin). The backgrounds (\(W/Z+\)jets, dibosons, top) and the three signal samples considered in the analysis are shown.

have been rescaled according to the HL expectations which are discussed in Ref. [43]. In particular some of the main JES and JER systematic uncertainties are halved. The main theoretical sources of uncertainty for the run-2 analysis come from choices on the resummation, renormalization, factorization and CKKW matching scale for the \(W/Z\)+jets backgrounds processes. A significant improvement in these systematic uncertainties is expected. Therefore, the current run-2 theoretical systematic uncertainties on the \(W/Z\)+jets backgrounds have been rescaled down to reach the level of few % (5% of the run-2 theoretical systematic uncertainties is kept). This level of systematic uncertainties corresponds to the one employed by the run-2 ATLAS mono-jet search [44]. Such an improvement in theoretical systematics for the VBF final state may be reached using similar techniques and here it is assumed that these improvements on the theoretical side will be reached for the HL-LHC phase. The same correlation scheme that has been used in [14] is also used for the projections presented here. Uncertainties arising from the finite MC statistics of the samples used are assumed to be negligible.

The results obtained by rescaling the signals and backgrounds to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Fig. 6. The results indicate that with such a luminosity the lowest masses considered (\(M_{\chi}\sim\)110 GeV) can be excluded at 95% CL. This study is aimed at providing a first idea of the potential reach of such an analysis with an increased luminosity. Indeed, with an integrated luminosity corresponding to the one that will be reached at the end of the run-2, there is no sensitivity to masses above 90 GeV. This analysis is very sensitive to the systematic uncertainties and a further optimization of the selection cuts on this model, taking into account the higher luminosity, could help to achieve a better reach. Furthermore, the HL-LHC trigger scenario has not been considered in this note. VBF analyses will probably benefit from a combination of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and VBF jet triggers. However, even with \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) thresholds raised by 50-100 GeV with respect to the current ones, the analysis is still sensitive to this model for the masses considered. The increase in the center of mass energy \(\sqrt{s}\) from 13 TeV to 14 TeV, which is expected at HL-LHC, has not been taken into account: the cross-section of the signals considered are expected to increase by \(\sim\)20% at \(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV, as shown in table 2, while the \(W/Z\)+jets cross sections will increase by \(\sim\)8%. Therefore, a slight increase in the signal significance is expected.

### The challenge of pile-up for VBF at the HL-LHC

In this study, jets are built from particle flow objects [45] using the anti-\(k_{t}\)[46] algorithm with radius parameter \(R=0.4\) as implemented in FastJet [47]. Even though the current ATLAS standard jet collection is constructed from locally calibrated topological calorimeter-cell clusters [48], particle flow jets are used for this analysis because of their superior jet energy resolution and pile-up stability at low \(p_{\rm T}\). Aside from a constant calibration to bring the jet response close to unity on average, jets are not further corrected for pile-up or calibrated for the detector response. Jets are only considered if \(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<4.5\).

Particle-level jets are built from detector-stable particles (\(c\tau>10\) mm) excluding muons and neutrinos as well as pile-up and any particles resulting from interactions with the detector. The same algorithm is used at particle level as is used at detector-level. A particle-level jet is matched to a detector-level jet if it is the highest \(p_{\rm T}\) particle-level jet satisfying \(p_{\rm T,part}>10\) GeV and \(\Delta R({\rm part.,det.})<0.3\). The parton label of a detector-level jet is the type of the highest energy parton ghost-associated [49] to the matched particle-level jet. Detector-level jets originating mostly from pile-up (henceforth, 'pile-up jets') will have no associated particle-level jet. There are ambiguous cases where a jet may have significant contributions from both the hard-scatter process as well as pile-up. The ambiguous case is assigned when there is a particle-level jet with \(p_{\rm T}>4\) GeV close (\(0.3<\Delta R<0.6\)) to a given detector-level jet.

Figure 7 shows the average number of jets of each type in \(H\to\) invisible and \(Z\)+jets events. Most Higgs events have two quark-initiated jets, but there is only 1 quark-initiated jet with \(p_{\rm T}>50\) GeV on average. The average number of pile-up jets per event in the two processes is nearly the same and is about 0.2. In the absence of any pile-up jet mitigation, there is also a spike in the \(\Delta\eta\) distribution at the edge of acceptance that is dominated by pile-up jets. Therefore, pile-up jet rejection is critical for the success of this analysis.

Charged particle tracks are constructed from hits in the upgraded inner tracker. No explicit track quality selection is applied in terms of the hit pattern in the ITk, though the baseline fake rate is expected to be significantly better than for the present detector. Tracks are ghost associated to the jets and required to have \(p_{\rm T}>900\) MeV and \(p_{\rm T}<40\) GeV (to suppress fake tracks). The difference between the primary vertex3\(z\) position and the track \(z_{0}\) (longitudinal impact parameter) must be less than \(2\sigma\), where \(\sigma\) is

the sum in quadrature of the track \(z_{0}\) and the vertex \(z\) uncertainties. The left plot of Figure 8 shows the vertex \(z\) resolution for the signal and background samples. The standard deviation of the central peak is about 0.1 mm. The reason for the long tails is from events where the selected vertex is not the primary vertex. The right plot of Figure 8 shows the vertex \(z\) resolution extended over the entire beamspot size. A Gaussian fit away from the peak indicates that the wrong vertex is chosen about 25% of the time. Further implications of this mis-identification are discussed below.

One of the key discriminating observables between pile-up jets and hard scatter jets is \(R_{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\)[50], which is the sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the tracks associated to the jet normalized by the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Only tracks with \(\Delta R<0.3\) are considered in the calculation of \(R_{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\). Figure 9 shows the distribution of \(R_{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\) for hard-scatter and pile

up jets which are relatively forward/central (\(|\eta|>1.2\)) and cases where the primary vertex is or is not correctly identified. When the primary vertex is mis-identified, the distribution of \(R_{P_{\mathrm{T}}}\) for hard-scatter jets is nearly the same as it was for pile-up jets when the vertex is correctly identified. For forward jets, the separation between the two classes is worse, due to the poorer vertex and track-to-vertex performance. As a baseline4, jets are declared 'hard-scatter' if \(R_{P_{\mathrm{T}}}>0.05\) which corresponds to 85% hard-scatter efficiency and 2% pile-up jet efficiency when \(|\eta|<1.2\) and \(|z^{\mathrm{reco}}-z^{\mathrm{true}}|<0.1\).

Footnote 4: Clearly, the optimal configuration will have an \(|\eta|\)-dependent definition.

A last input that is critical to the \(H\to\) invisible search is the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), a proxy for the Higgs \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). As it depends on all of the reconstructed objects, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) reconstruction is a complex task. There has not been a detailed optimization of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) reconstruction for the upgraded ATLAS detector; in this analysis, the negative sum of the transverse momenta of all reconstructed jets is used (and indicated by the symbol \(E_{\mathrm{T,jet}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)).

An event selection based on the jets and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) described above is modeled after the run-2 analysis [14] in order to assess the impact of various pile-up mitigation scenarios. It is likely that a dedicated optimization for the amount of data and detector conditions will improve the result, but this is beyond the scope of this illustrative study5. Due to limitations of MC statistics, a simplified version of the run-2 VBF \(H\to\) invisible analysis as introduced in Sec. 5.1 is used. In particular, all of the angular requirements with jets are removed and there is no binning in \(M(j_{1},j_{2})\). Additionally, \(E_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm miss}>150\) GeV6.

Footnote 5: Furthermore, the challenges of event triggering are ignored. With the many improvements to upgraded ATLAS triggering system, it is likely that despite a more challenging environment, triggering may be more effective at the HL-LHC than the present LHC as mentioned before.

Footnote 6: Reference [14] required the full \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>180\) GeV and the \(H_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) to be above 150 GeV. The latter also includes pile-up jets. The requirement used here is a hybrid that uses the sum of jets (so like \(H_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)) but does not include pile-up jets (like \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)) that compromises performance and the availability of MC statistics.

For the run-2 analysis, the event selection efficiency for \(Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}\) events is about \(2\times 10^{-6}\) and about 0.5% for the signal with a \({\cal B}(H\to\mbox{\rm invisible})=100\%\) (which is about 85% from VBF). The background is nearly half QCD \(Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}\) and half QCD \(W\)+jets. Since the following results are only based on \(Z\)+jets, branching ratio limits are computed by doubling the \(Z\)+jets background. It is likely that with the extended coverage of the ITk relative to the current tracker the lost leptons will be suppressed and thus the \(W\)+jets background will be less than the \(Z\)+jets rate so this approximation is conservative.

A simplified statistical analysis is performed to assess the impact of several scenarios on the \(H\to\) invisible branching ratio limit with the full HL-LHC dataset. A one-bin statistical test with one overall source of systematic uncertainty is performed to determine if a particular signal yield is excluded. The signal yield is scanned to determine the largest branching ratio that would be not excluded at the 95% confidence level. Table 5 presents the corresponding limits, normalized to the one for the run-2 systematic uncertainties and truth-based pile-up tagging to show the relative gains and losses possible under various scenarios. The choice of showing only a normalized \({\cal B}\) is motivated by the fact that a simplified analysis has been performed with the aim to show the importance of having a pile-up tagger for this analysis and not to optimize the reach of an Higgs invisible search at HL-LHC. The three rows correspond to different strategies for removing pile-up jets. The first row corresponds to the case where pile-up jets are not actively removed, the second row indicates the performance when pile-up jets are identified using \(R_{p_{\rm T}}\), and the last row represents the case where truth labels are used to reject pile-up. The four columns correspond to different assumptions on the systematic uncertainties at the time of the HL-LHC. A total systematic uncertainty of 10% is used7, which is similar to the run-2 result; this scenario is indicated by the results in the first column. The second and third columns show results with systematic uncertainties that are half as large and the last column uses systematic uncertainties that are a factor of ten smaller than the present analysis. To give an indication of the potential of harsher event selections, the third column supposes that the HL-LHC analysis will have the same number of selected signal events as the current analysis. For this scenario, the background efficiency is assumed to be 10% of the signal efficiency.

Footnote 7: Implemented as a single component uncertainty for a one-bin counting experiment.

With a realistic reduction in the systematic uncertainty and tighter selection criteria, it may be possible to significantly improve the sensitivity. The limit improves from including a simple \(R_{p_{\rm T}}\)-based pile-up jet rejection, though the gap with the truth-information-based tagger indicates that there is room (and reward) for developing a more sophisticated approach.

## 6 Conclusion

A new \(SU(2)\) fermionic triplet, added on top of the SM with an approach inspired by the Minimal Dark Matter model, provides a good dark matter candidate if a new symmetry is imposed (e.g. the SM B-L). This triplet has mass \(\sim\)3 TeV if the relic abundance is matched, however smaller masses are also allowed in case of non-thermal production mechanisms or if it constitutes only a fraction of the DM abundance. Such a triplet can be produced at the LHC and it can be probed in different ways. This note presents results for the mono-photon and the VBF+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) final states.

The run-2 mono-photon search has been reinterpreted in the context of this model assuming an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), which will be available with the HL-LHC. The result of this study shows that masses of \(\chi_{0}\) below 310 GeV will be probed at 95% CL assuming the same systematic uncertainties adopted in the run-2 analysis.

The pure WIMP triplet can also be produced via VBF giving rise to a final state with jets largely separated in rapidity and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). This final state is the same final state that has been defined to look for the invisible decay of the Higgs boson produced via VBF. The run-2 analysis, applying small changes in the selection, is used as basis, to test the DM triplet model at an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). Projections are presented for the HL-LHC scenario are presented showing that, with such a luminosity, it will be possible to test the lower masses of this model (up to \(\sim\)110 GeV). A slight improvement in the signal significance from the increase of the center-of-mass energy to \(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV foreseen for the HL-LHC is expected for both analyses. Complementary searches, such as mono-jet searches and disappearing track signatures, would also set stringent constraints to this model.

Many experimental aspects of the search in the VBF+\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) channel will be particularly challenging including the rejection of pile-up jets, the identification of the primary vertex, and the resolution of low \(p_{\rm T}\) jets. With a combination of pile-up robustness studies, analysis optimization, and theory uncertainty reduction, perhaps in part from auxiliary SM measurements, then \(H\rightarrow\) invisible and EW triplet DM searches at the HL-LHC may be significantly improved.
