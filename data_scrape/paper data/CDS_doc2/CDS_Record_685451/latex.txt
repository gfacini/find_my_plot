A key requirement for the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker is to contribute to the electron identification by detecting transition radiation. The quality and quantity of the radiator material is a critical parameter for the performance of any transition radiation detector. In this note, studies of the transition radiation yield with the actual ATLAS TRT geometry are presented and compared with the results presented in the ATLAS Physics TDR. A comparison with the optimal configuration for the transition radiation performance is made.

## 1 Introduction

The Transition Radiator Tracker (TRT) [1] is one of the tracker devices of the Inner Detector of the ATLAS experiment. The TRT is a straw drift tube detector with a central barrel section and two end-cap sides. It provides electron identification via transition radiation and it is a continuous tracking device, providing 36 measurements for a track in average.

When a charged ultra-relativistic particle crosses the boundary between two media with different dielectric constants, the abrupt change in the electric field triggers the emission of electro-magnetic radiation, the transition radiation (TR). Since the particle energy is very high, the emitted photons are soft X-rays that can be measured easily. However, to have a significant number of photons many boundaries are required. This can be achieved either by means of "regular radiators" built with many evenly-spaced foils or with "irregular radiators" made of foams or fibres. Consequently, a critical parameter for the electron identification performances of any transition radiation detector (TRD) is the quality and quantity of the radiator material. Standard radiators for TRD are made of 15-20 \(\mu\)m thick polypropylene foils with a regular spacing of 200-300 \(\mu\)m between them. Such regular radiators provide the highest TR yield, if the foil thickness and the spacing between foils can be optimised for the detector considered. However, in general the spacing is determined by the maximum practical length of the detector, and not by the optimal TR yield.

Because of its particular geometry, for the barrel part of the TRT a radiator made of foils cannot used. The axial barrel straws are embedded in a radiator made of polypropylene/polyetilene fibres. These fibres have been measured to provide a TR yield close to 80% of the optimal one. In the end-cap, layers of radial straws are alternated with layers of polypropylene foils, which provide 90% of the optimal TR yield. Foils are interlaced with a fabric spacer 0.2 mm thick and with a density of 2 g/m\({}^{2}\).

This note describes TR performance studies done using a more update TRT geometry and radiator configuration with respect to [1], and an improved TR, dE/dx and charge collection simulation. This new simulation has been optimised and tested using data collected during two dedicated test-beams in the H8 beam line at the CERN SPS. Data collected with a small amount of TR radiation have been used to tune the simulation of the straw ionization.

This new code gives an agreement with data for dE/dx better than 1%. Hence, we used it together with the data with TR radiation to tune the Transition radiation simulation of the TRT. The improvements and the comparison with data will be presented in section 2. In section 3, the effect of the new TRT geometry on TR performances are studied using this improved simulation. The results are also compared with the performances studies in the ATLAS physics TDR [2].

## 2 Optimisation of the TR and dE/dx Monte Carlo simulation

### Experimental set-up

Data collected with two test-beam set-ups in the H8 beam line at the CERN SPS in 1999 and in 2000, have been used to study different radiator materials and to tune the TRT simulation. Data containing charged pions and electrons were collected at 5 GeV, 10 GeV and 20 GeV energies.

In 1999, the test beam set-up straw prototype consisted of 12 straws perpendicular to the beam axis, arranged as shown in Figure 1. Other equipment consisted in two silicon detectors, with an intrinsic accuracy of about 10 \(\mu m\) and excellent tracking capability, two standard beam chambers for a first coarse track reconstruction and two scintillators used in the trigger. Two Cherenkov detectors and a lead-glass calorimeter were used for particle identification. The straw prototype was placed between the two silicon detectors. Tracks were reconstructed using the silicon detectors. Only well-identified particles crossing all straws and perpendicular to the radiator material were used.

The test beam prototype was made of standard TRT 4 mm diameter Kapton straws, 10 cm long and with a 30 \(\mu m\) gold-plated tungsten wire. The ionization gas mixture was 70% Xe + 20% CF\({}_{4}\)10% CO\({}_{2}\). The gain was set to \(2.5\times 10^{4}\) and stabilized with an accuracy better than 1%, nominal ATLAS TRT values.

There was a 2 cm gap between the straws optionally interleaved with different radiator samples. Tree types of radiator were tested: a regular radiator 8 mm thick made of 15 \(\mu m\) foils interleaved with 200 \(\mu m\) spacers made of tulle, and two kinds of fibre radiators always 8 mm thick. Each straw was read out by a conventional ADC, to be able to measure the full dE/dx and TR spectra.

Test beam data collected with a TRT sector prototype without radiator material, were used to validate the drift time simulation. Standard TRT straws were read out using the nominal TRT front-end electronics. The rest of the equipment and the straws conditions were as above. The straw space-drift time relationships were measured using the tracks reconstructed with the silicon detectors.

To compare the experimental data with the Monte Carlo simulation, samples of charged pions and electrons of 5 GeV, 10 GeV and 20 GeV were generated and tracked through the GEANT [4] simulation of the test beam apparatus. The Monte Carlo is based on GEANT 3.21 and runs under ATLSIM [3]. The simulation used the response to tracks and TR photons impinging on each straw implemented the standard digitisation procedure in the ATLAS TRT simulation.

### TR and dE/dx simulation

The energy loss for each charged particle crossing the ionization gas is calculated using the Photo-Absorption Ionization (PAI) model [5]. The track ionization is deposited in a number of primary ionization clusters along the particle path length in the straw gas. These clusters drift towards the anode, where the signal amplitude and arrival time are calculated adding on all primary clusters produced by charged particles traversing that straw. In case transition radiation photons are produced (as described below), the deposited point-like ionization cluster is added to the other clusters in the straw. The obtained signal is then folded with a model of the electronic signal shape.

electrons. The simulated dE/dx spectrum for both electrons and charged pions, generated using the code in [1], showed a 2% discrepancy in the high energy deposited tails and a disagreement in the peak position due to a miss-modelling of the low energy cluster deposition [6]. The discrepancy was due to a non prefect modelling of the electron attachment effect (which affect the peak), space charge effects and \(\delta\)-ray tracking into the straw, which affects the tails.

Hence, following changes were introduced in the digitisation code:

* the electron attachment effects were added to the avalanching model simulation;
* the space charge screening due to the electron-ion avalanche was re-activated. This has particular relevance once a TR photon is produced, as it influences the acceptance and calibration parameters of a straw; In a proportional or drift chamber, positive ions are released during the amplification process. While the negative charges (electrons) are collected on the anode wire, the ions drift slowly towards the cathode. In normal operational conditions the charge density in the electron-ion avalanche is small compared to the charge density on the wire, and only small signal distortions occur. However, the charge accumulated by the TR photon may produce distortions of the effective electric field, thus influencing acceptance and calibration parameters of the chamber.
* the simulation of \(\delta\)-rays was modified to avoid double counting and to correct their path length inside the straw.

These changes reduced the data Monte Carlo discrepancies to less than 1%. At this point, we could use the data collected with the radiators interleaved between the straws to tune the TR simulation.

The simulation of the transition radiation is more complicated, as GEANT3 does not have the transition radiation process as default. This process is introduced modifying GEANT3 during the simulation phase. The emission of TR photons with the appropriate energy and the probability of their absorption by the material before they reach the anode, is parameterized using the formulae in [7]. These formulae are coded in a routine called each time GEANT does a step. TR photons are then generated in the radiator material and only for tracks with a suitable Lorentz factor \(\beta\gamma>1000\) (mainly electrons). The TR photons absorbed by the straw active gas are added to the straw output signal.

For the TR generation, the regular radiator (end-cap) is assumed to be made of 12 \(\mu\)m foils to reproduce the single straw energy deposition spectrum measured in test-beam data. In reality the foil is 15 \(\mu\)m thick, thus the number of foils in the simulation is increased by 25%, to account correctly for the radiator material, and the gap between foils is decreased. To ensure that particles perpendicular to the radiator traverse all the stack, the number of gaps is set to be equal to the number of foils. The fibre radiator (barrel) is also simulated as a stack of 12 \(\mu\)m foils separated by a gap of 160 \(\mu\)m. The value of the gap is set to reproduce the foam radiator TR yield as measured in the test beam data.

In the end-cap, to correctly account for the TRT material in GEANT, the stack of radiator foils is described as a single volume, with a density equal to the integral of the foils and spacer material over the full distance between neighbouring straw layers. For the barrel the density is the one of the foam radiator.

Figures 2 and 3 show the comparison between test-beam data and Monte Carlo simulation for 20 GeV charged pions and electrons. For pions all straws are used. For electrons only straws between layer 6 and 9 are used, as for these straws, the TR reached saturation. Figure 2 shows the differential distribution of the energy deposited in each straw for charged pions and electrons (foil radiator). The overflow is set by the ADC dynamical range and the last bin in the plot is the integral of all events with energy deposited above 10 keV. Electrons and charged pions differential spectra have similar dE/dx shape, but electrons have a significant tail at energies above 4.5-5 keV due to TR photons. For pions, the dE/dx spectrum above 4.5-5 keV is mostly due to \(\delta\)-rays.

Figure 3 shows the integrated probability that the energy deposited in a straw by a track exceeds a certain threshold. All Figures show an excellent agreement between test-beam data and Monte Carlo simulation.

All these improvements in the TR and dE/dx simulation have been transfered to the full ATLAS TRT simulation to re-evaluate the detector performances.

The data collected in the year 2000 test beam with a TRT sector prototype, without radiator material between straws, have been used to validate the the Monte Carlo simulation of the straw drift time.

In the program used for the TDR and for Time-over-Threshold studies [6], the wire voltage was set to 1.8 keV, higher than the nominal one (1.5 keV). Thus the total charge-collection maximum time was shorter than the measured one, 38 ns compared to 42 ns. Once the wire voltage was correctly set and the nominal electronics shaping functions were implemented, the agreement between Monte Carlo and data both for the RT relations and track resolution became quite good, as shown in Figures 4.

## 3 TR performance with the improved simulation

Since the TRT will be both a tracking device and a transition radiation detector, a standard TRT straw drift tube provides two types of information: the distance of closest approach of the track to the wire (tracking) and the energy deposited in the straw (particle identification). This deposited energy is the sum of the ionization loss from the charged particle traversing the straw and the large energy deposition due to TR photon absorption. Hence, to ensure a good track reconstruction efficiency and electron identification, the TRT front-end electronics has two discriminator thresholds. The low threshold, set to 0.2 keV, is just above the noise level and below the average energy loss of a MIP in the straw gas (2 keV). It records the initial ionization cluster of a charged particle and is used for track reconstruction (TRT hits). The higher threshold, 5 keV (TR threshold), is used for electron identification and is set to maximize the separation between electrons and charged pions over a large range of energies.

Electrons are identified counting the fraction of TRT straws, associated to a track, which have a high-threshold hit (TR hits). The minimal value of this fraction is set by the chosen electron efficiency. The TR performance is then studied by looking at the efficiency of charged pions which pass this cut. Charged pion rejection is defined as the reciprocal of the efficiency.

Since [2], the TRT geometry has changed. Removing the service gap between the wheels A and B has a minor impact on the particle identification performance of the detector. Other modifications reduced the electron/pion separation: a 3 mm dead region was introduced at each end of each straw and, in the barrel the straw active length was shortened by 2 mm. Furthermore, the service gap between barrel and end-cap has been widened and the barrel modules structure implemented, see Figure 5.

The particle identification performance in [2] were underestimated, as in the simulation the description of the radiator material and the treatment of particles not perpendicular to the radiator were not optimal and led to lower TR yields. In this new version of the simulation, the correct path length for particles not perpendicular to the radiator foil is used and the effective number of foils is derived from test-beam data, as discussed above. Table 1 shows the number of radiator foils and spacers in the end-cap wheels used for the physics TDR. Table 2 shows the number of foils for the three end-cap wheels in the new simulation. The number of foils for the barrel is now 39. Figure 6 displays the new TRT end-cap geometry. The predicted number of radiator foils in the end-cap is show Table 2.

The TR performance has been studied using 2 GeV and 20 GeV p\({}_{\rm T}\) charged pions and electrons generated through the full inner detector geometry and reconstructed using the XKALMAN pattern recognition program.
