**Expected electron performance in the ATLAS experiment**

The ATLAS collaboration

###### Abstract

We describe the latest improvements in electron reconstruction and identification and give an update on the expected electron performance of the ATLAS detector. All results presented in this note are based on Monte-Carlo simulation studies. They indicate that with a good understanding of the combined inner detector and calorimeter performance, powerful reconstruction software and a detailed material description in front of the calorimeter, a rejection of \(10^{5}\) against jets and background electrons from photon conversions can be achieved with an electron efficiency of 71% for \(p_{T}>20\) GeV. A very high purity electron sample can therefore be obtained in this \(p_{T}\) range.

## 1 Introduction

Estimating the nature and relative contributions of the main backgrounds to measurements in final states with isolated electrons at the LHC over the full detector acceptance is of crucial importance. The background to isolated electrons include electrons from heavy flavors and background electrons from Dalitz decays or photon conversions originating from neutral pion decays and jets. It has been shown that in the case of inclusive electron searches, a rejection of \(10^{5}\) against jets and background electrons is required to bring the background safely below the level of single isolated electrons, which is about two orders of magnitude worse than at the Tevatron [1]. At the same time, a high and uniform efficiency over the full \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) range is necessary 1. To achieve this, the combination of inner detector and calorimeter information, a powerful reconstruction software as well as a detailed material description in front of the calorimeter are essential. This note describes the latest status of the reconstruction and identificationalgorithms as well as the expected performance on physics processes. The performance numbers quoted in this note are mostly based on simulated samples at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV and are calculated in the absence of pile-up. Updated numbers on efficiency and rejection related to recent changes in the identification selection are given for samples at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The difference between 7 TeV and 10 TeV samples is expected to be small for efficiency and rejection estimates over the whole phase space. We will focus on cuts-based electron identification as opposed to more complex multivariate identification tools that are described elsewhere [2].

Electron trigger performance is described in Section 3. In the following sections the improvements in reconstruction are discussed followed by the offline identification cut optimisation strategy, chosen variables and cut values. Section 6 describes the most recent changes in electron identification based on the 2009/2010 LHC data-taking runs. Section 7 is dedicated to the calorimeter and tracking isolation and the final sections to the estimated efficiency and rejection for known and hypothetical physics processes covering the detector \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) acceptance.

## 2 The ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter and inner detector

The ATLAS electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter has a fine segmentation in both the lateral (\(\eta\times\phi\) space) and longitudinal directions of the showers. At high energy, most of the EM shower energy is collected in the second layer which has a lateral granularity of \(0.025\times 0.025\) in \(\eta\times\phi\) space. The first layer consists of finer-grained strips in the \(\eta\)-direction (with a coarser granularity in \(\phi\)), which offer excellent \(\gamma-\pi^{0}\) discrimination. These two layers are complemented by a presampler layer placed in front with coarse granularity to correct for energy lost in the material before the calorimeter, and by a back layer behind, which enables a correction to be made for the tail of very highly energetic EM showers. The transition region between the barrel and end-cap EM calorimeters, \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\), is expected to have poorer performance because of the large amount of material in front of the first active calorimeter layers. The presampler layer covers only the range \(|\eta|<1.8\). The end-cap EM calorimeters (EMEC) are divided into two wheels, the outer and inner wheels covering the ranges \(1.375<|\eta|<2.5\) and \(2.5<|\eta|<3.2\), respectively. The forward calorimeters (FCal) cover the range \(3.1<|\eta|<4.9\) and also provide some EM shower identification thanks to their longitudinal segmentation into three layers as well as the different absorber material used (copper for the layer closest to the interaction point and tungsten for the other two).

The ATLAS inner detector provides precise track reconstruction over \(|\eta|<2.5\). It consists of three layers of pixel detectors close to the beam-pipe, four layers of silicon microstrip detectors (SCT) providing eight hits per track at intermediate radii, and a transition radiation tracker (TRT) at the outer radii, providing about 35 hits per track (in the range \(|\eta|<2.0\)). The TRT also provides substantial discriminating power between electrons and pions over a wide energy range (between 0.5 and 100 GeV). The pixel vertexing layer (also called the b-layer) is located just outside the beam-pipe at a radius of 50 mm, and provides precision vertexing and significant rejection of photon conversions (through a requirement of a track with a hit in this layer).

## 3 Electron and photon trigger

The ATLAS trigger system is divided into three levels. The hardware based first level trigger (L1) performs a preliminary selection using reduced granularity data from the calorimeter and dedicated muon chamber information. It operates within a latency of 2.5 \(\mu s\), designed for an average output rate of 75 kHz, with an upper limit of 100 kHz. Further event selection is done by the software based second level trigger (L2) and Event Filter (EF), collectively referred to as the High Level Trigger (HLT). The reconstruction at L2 is seeded by the L1 result and uses the full granularity of the ATLAS subdetectors. The processed data are contained in the regions of the detector identified by the L1 as Regions of Interest (RoI) and corresponds to about 1-4 % of the data of each detector. The L2 is designed to give an output rate of less than 2 kHz with a mean processing time of 40 ms. Upon an L2 accept all the detector data are combined together into a single data block in a process called event-building. The EF has a latency of 4 s. The event rate is further reduced to about 200 Hz. Seeded by the L2 results, more complex algorithms, profiting from offline-like calibration and alignment can be used.

### Electron and Photon Trigger Selection

At L1, photons and electrons are selected using calorimeter information with a reduced granularity which is given by the so-called Trigger Tower (TT), with a size of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\). RoIs are formed for each identified electromagnetic object and information on the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) position and the energy threshold passed are associated to them. The L1 cluster size is \(4\times 4\) trigger towers.

L2 is seeded by these L1 RoIs. At this stage full granularity data are available. Fast calorimeter and tracking reconstruction algorithms are deployed. The default calorimeter reconstruction works in a similar way as the offline algorithms (the offline algorithms will be described in the next section). The main difference to the offline is the cluster seed finding step which is done using the most energetic cell in the second EM layer at L2 while in the offline reconstruction the sliding window algorithm is used. Cluster building, calibration and cluster corrections are the same as in the offline reconstruction. For tracking purposes three different tracking algorithms are available: SiTrack, IdScan and TRTSegFinder. SiTrack and IdScan have been developed in an independent way from the offline track reconstruction to fulfill the more stringent requirements at L2 concerning timing and complexity. TRTSegfinder has been ported from the offline into L2. Detailed information about these algorithms can be found in [2]. The main characteristics are:

* IdScan: fast pattern recognition is done by first determining the z-position of the interaction point along the beam axis and then performing combinatorial tracking only inside groups of space points that point back to that determined position.
* SiTrack: the formation of track seeds is done using all possible pairing of space points coming from the innermost two layers. Each seed is extrapolated to the beam line using a straight line approximation and a transverse impact parameter cut is applied. Each remaining seed is then extrapolated to the following silicon layers and extensions to the track are selected applying a cut on the distance between the outer space point and the extrapolated seed. The full track is then formed from the union of the space points from all the merged extensions and a track refit is done after removal of duplicate tracks.
* TRTSegFinder: TRT track reconstruction is based on the Hough-transform [3] (histogramming) method. In the initialisation step, a set of trajectories in the \(\phi-\) R(Z) space is calculated in the barrel (endcap) TRT taking into account the value of the local magnetic field. Then a histogram is filled for each event with the TRT hit positions. Track candidates are identified from peaks in this histogram. At least 8 hits are required for a track candidate which in addition has to fulfill track quality criteria such as number of unique hits (hits belonging to only one track) and the ratio of hits to number of straws crossed by the trajectory. In the final step drift information is used by tuning the parameters so that the track lies on the maximum number of drift circle positions.

The performance of SiTrack and IdScan in simulation is similar. However, differences in performance very likely will occur during data taking due to e.g. the effects from dead and noisy channels. In initial running all three will be run to ensure minimal trigger losses with respect to offline. In the softwarerelease used for these studies, the main electron chains use an 'or' between SiTrack and IdScan. The EF uses the offline reconstruction algorithms. Due to timing constraints, Bremsstrahlung recovery is not performed. Non-essential parts for the identification of e/\(\gamma\) candidates, such as the four-momentum builder, are not run. The electron and photon identification performed at the trigger level is similar to the offline identification (the offline identification selection will be described later). The cuts used at the EF level are harmonised to the offline ones. However, unlike the offline identification cuts, the trigger level cuts are not \(p_{T}\) dependent. The cuts for the trigger selection are taken from the offline selection in the \(p_{T}\) bin corresponding to the trigger threshold. At L2 only a subset of the offline/EF selection criteria is used and the optimisation is done in such a way that the cuts are looser than the EF ones. For the first physics runs, the so called primary or main triggers to be used and their physics motivations are summarised in Table 1.

### Expected E/\(\gamma\) trigger performance

For the first physics run a luminosity of \(L=10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) was assumed at a center of mass energy of 10 TeV. In the meantime the center of mass energy for initial running has been reduced to 7 TeV. Table 2 shows the expected trigger rates for the primary e/\(\gamma\) triggers at 10 TeV. At 7 TeV, the cross sections of the backgrounds and Standard Model physics channels are about 30% lower with the exception of minimum bias events, which only decrease by about 10%. The uncertainties on the QCD jet production from MC is of the order of 2-3. Fig. 1 shows the electron trigger efficiency as a function of \(E_{T}\) and \(|\eta|\) for the primary triggers foreseen at \(L=10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The efficiencies in the plateau region are also given in Table 3. The trigger losses with respect to offline are of the order of 1% and to a large extent occur in the barrel/endcap crack region. At L2, the e5_medium and e10_medium losses are mainly arising from the calorimeter selections, tracks which were not found by the L2 Si-based tracking algorithms (especially in the end-cap region) and by losses due to the cluster-track matching cuts in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline
**Signature** & **Motivation** \\ \hline \hline
2e5\_medium & \(J/\psi\to ee\), \(Y\to ee\), Drell-Yan production \\ e10\_medium & \(e^{\pm}\) from b,c decays, E/p studies \\ g20\_loose & direct photon production, jet calibration using \(\gamma\)-jet events, high-\(p_{T}\) physics, e-no track \\  & trigger \\ e20\_loose & high-\(p_{T}\) physics, \(Z\to ee,W\to e\nu\) \\ em105\_passHLT & New physics, check for possible problems \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Summary of the main electron and photon triggers envisaged for the first physics run at L \(\approx 10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) together with their physics motivation. The terminology used for the trigger signature column in the table is the following: “2e5_medium” for example stands for 2 electron objects with a \(p_{T}\) greater than 5 GeV and “medium” identification requirements (the electron identification criteria is explained in Section 5); “g20_loose” describes a single photon trigger with a threshold of 20 GeV and “loose” identification requirements; “em105_passHLT” is a trigger that looks for energy deposits greater than 105 GeV in the electromagnetic calorimeter, “passHLT” meaning that there is no requirements (no selection) at the high level trigger.

Figure 1: Trigger efficiencies at L1, L2 and EF as a function of the generated electron \(E_{T}\) (left) and \(|\eta|\) (right) for the signatures e5_medium, e10_medium and e20_loose. The efficiencies are obtained using single electrons from a sample with \(0.5<E_{T}<80\) GeV and are normalised with respect to offline electrons with \(E_{T}>5,10\) or 20 GeV passing the medium (for e5_medium and e10_medium) or loose (for e20_loose) set of electron identification cuts in the \(\eta\) range -2.5 to 2.5 (see section 5 for details on offline identification selection). For the \(|\eta|\) plot single electrons with an offline \(E_{T}>10,15\) or 25 GeV (from the top to the bottom plot) were chosen to show the efficiency in the plateau.

Each of these sources of losses occur equally frequently in e5_medium, however, for e10_medium, the majority of the L2 losses arise from the cluster-track matching cuts. At EF the losses for these triggers arise mainly from differences in the tracking. In the case of e20_loose, additional losses of 0.8% occur due to loose offline electron objects associated with a TRT-only track. Thus, these tracks are not reconstructed by the Si-based L2 track algorithms, but are, to a large extent, reconstructed by the TRT based L2 tracking algorithm.

## 4 Electron reconstruction algorithm

The standard electron reconstruction procedure is based on clusters reconstructed in the electromagnetic calorimeter, which then are associated to tracks of charged particles reconstructed in the Inner Detector. This algorithm has been developed to allow for an optimal reconstruction of the four-momentum of electrons for the full momentum and pseudorapidity range and for any luminosity. Information from both detectors is used to allow electrons to be identified with the lowest possible amount of background, keeping in mind that the optimum between the identification efficiency and background rejection depends on the analysis.

Electron reconstruction begins with the creation of a preliminary set of seed clusters. Seed clusters with energies above 2.5 GeV are formed by a sliding window algorithm, where the seed clusters are \(3\times 5\) in \(\eta/\phi\) middle layer cell units (\(0.025\times 0.025\)). After an energy comparison, duplicate clusters are removed from nearby seed clusters.

In the region of the tracker detectors (\(|\eta|<2.5\)), an electron is defined by the existence of one or more reconstructed tracks matched to a seed cluster. The \(\eta\) region above 2.5 will be discussed in Section 9. The track-to-cluster matching thus forms the central part of the electron reconstruction. Reconstructed tracks are matched to seed clusters by extrapolating them from their last measurement point to the second

The efficiencies for e5_medium and e10_medium are given with respect to the medium offline selections (see section 5 for details on offline identification selection) with a \(E_{T}\) threshold which is 5 GeV higher than the cut applied at the EF (e.g. it is 10 GeV for e5_medium). In the case of e20_loose the efficiency is given with respect to the loose offline selections. The error given is the statistical error.

layer of the calorimeter.

The impact point \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) coordinates are then compared to the corresponding seed cluster \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) in that layer. If their difference is below a certain threshold then the track is considered matched to the cluster. Special care is taken in order to account for Bremsstrahlung losses. To this end, the sign-corrected \(\Delta\phi\) window is larger on the side where the extrapolated track bends as it traverses the tracker magnetic field. In the case of tracks that do not contain silicon hits, the matching is restricted to the \(\phi\) coordinate, due to the fact that the accuracy on the \(\eta\) coordinate, as measured by the TRT, is limited. In this case only a rough track matching, e.g. barrel track matched to a barrel cluster, is required.

It is quite possible (e.g. in the case of electromagnetic showers) that more than one track matches the same seed cluster. In this case all the tracks are retained and ordered according to the quality of their match. The track with the smallest difference \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) between its impact point on the electromagnetic calorimeter and the seed cluster is considered as the best match. Tracks with silicon hits have priority over tracks without silicon hits, the latter tracks being viewed as more likely to belong to electrons originating from photon conversions. The information related to the track-to-cluster matching is retained for all the tracks assigned to the reconstructed electron object and is used during the particle identification, as described later in this note.

As mentioned above, the track matching is affected by Bremsstrahlung losses which result in an asymmetric sign-dependent \(\Delta\phi\) distribution. Studies have shown that this distribution becomes symmetric if one extrapolates the track from the perigee and uses the cluster energy for the electron momentum. While the extrapolation from the last measurement is used in the track match, the \(\Delta\phi\) value from the extrapolation computed with the latter procedure is stored for each track assigned to the electron object. Using the new extrapolation in the track-to-cluster match remains an option and could be used during any reprocessing campaign.

There is an inherent ambiguity between a prompt electron and a converted photon, since both objects are characterized by the existence of tracks pointing to an electromagnetic cluster. In the current reconstruction strategy, objects that have tracks matched to seed clusters will subsequently be treated as electrons. As a result almost all converted photons will be handled as electrons during this stage of the reconstruction and end up in the electron container. This results in a significant contamination of the electron sample by converted photons but ensures on the other hand a high electron reconstruction efficiency. The particle identification criteria, described later in this note, will be able to select the prompt electrons from the original electron candidate sample. Converted photons which are ambiguous with reconstructed electrons are specifically labeled and can also be found in the photon container (as duplicates).

Electromagnetic showers characterized by tracks matched to the seed cluster are considered as electron candidates. The electromagnetic cluster is then recomputed using a \(3\times 7\) (\(5\times 5\)) sliding window in \(\eta/\phi\) middle layer cell units in the barrel (end caps). A \(3\times 5\) seed cluster size is explicitly chosen to be a subset of the final electromagnetic cluster sizes. Several corrections to the reconstructed cluster energy are then applied. Finally the electron four-momentum is computed using in addition the track information from the best track matched to the original seed cluster (keeping links to all tracks matched to the electron in a \(\Delta\eta\), \(\Delta\phi\) window). The energy is computed as a weighted average between the cluster energy and the track momentum. The \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) directions are taken from the corresponding track parameters unless the track contains no silicon hits, in which case \(\eta\) is provided by the cluster \(\eta\)-pointing. In cases where the track has only TRT hits, the \(\phi\) position is taken from the track and the \(\eta\) is provided by cluster \(\eta\)-pointing.

The reconstruction efficiency of low-\(p_{T}\) electrons (a few GeV) can be improved by using the track as a starting point. The track is then extrapolated to the electromagnetic calorimeter and a cluster is built using the track impact point as a seed. This algorithm will not be further described in this note. It is described in detail in [2]. In the case of very forward electrons, where there are no tracking detectors, the electron candidates contain only the electromagnetic calorimeter cluster information.

The most important changes in the electron reconstruction since reference [1] concern the cluster seed finding and track matching. The cluster seed definition was changed to improve the performance at low energy. Moving from \(5\times 5\) cells in middle layer cell units with a threshold of 3 GeV used in [1] to \(3\times 5\) cells and 2.5 GeV threshold improves the reconstruction efficiency of low energy clusters and lowers the duplicate cluster rate. The duplicate cluster rates are now below the percent level for both \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events, while with the previous cluster definition this was a few percent. The improvements in the cluster-track match concern both the selection criteria and the cuts applied. In reference [1], track candidates were rejected for \(E/p>10\) and the "best track" was selected to be the one with \(E/p\) closest to 1. The \(E/p\) cut resulted in a few percent inefficiency due to Bremsstrahlung losses mostly at large \(\eta\). The \(E/p\) cut is now not applied anymore. In addition, only one track match was kept for further analysis. This has now been extended to include all matches in a \(\Delta\eta\), \(\Delta\phi\) window, giving priority to tracks with silicon hits. This facilitates the study of complicated topologies.

## 5 Cuts-based optimisation for electron identification

The baseline electron identification in ATLAS relies on cuts using variables that provide good separation between isolated electrons and jets (faking electrons). These variables include calorimeter, tracker and combined calorimeter/tracker information. They can be applied independently and three reference sets of cuts have been defined with increasing background rejection power: loose, medium and tight. Shower shape variables of the second calorimeter layer and hadronic leakage variables are used in the loose selection. First calorimeter layer cuts, track quality requirements and track-cluster matching are added at the level of the medium selection. The tight selection adds E/p, b-layer hit requirements and the particle identification potential of the TRT. Table 4 gives the list of all variables used in the "loose", "medium" and "tight" selections. To allow for robustness at startup, various changes are made based on the expected level of understanding of the detector performance (changes are given with respect to [2]):

* The cluster track matching and transverse impact parameter requirements are loosened.
* Redundant first layer variables are removed from the selection and new, more discriminant, variables are added.
* All first layer cuts are loosened to account for uncertainties on the material in front of the calorimeter and cross-talk dependence. For compensation, the lateral shower shape cuts in the second layer of the EM calorimeter are tightened as well as the hadronic leakage requirements.
* In addition, the trigger and offline selection have been harmonised in accordance with g20 loose and e10 medium rate requirements (see section 3 for details).

The classification of electron candidates based on Monte-Carlo truth is crucial for any cut optimisation. Truth classification (provided by a common tool in ATLAS) was used for all of the following cut optimisation studies. The categories most commonly considered are:

* Isolated electrons, if they match a true electron originating from a Z or W boson.
* Hadron Fakes, if they do not match a true electron, muon or tau.
* Non-isolated electrons, if they match a true electron originating from b(c)-mesons.
* Background electrons, if they match a true electrons coming from Dalitz decays or coming from a photon. The electrons from photons can be further divided depending upon the origin of the photon, for example the photon may arise from a decay of a neutral pion, from the Bremsstrahlung cascade from a true electron coming from a Z, or from an initial or final state radiation of a Z boson.

### Definition and optimisation of "loose" and "medium" electron selection

The shower variables used in the loose and medium selection are given as an input to a multi-variate analysis program (TMVA [4]) in order to perform a cut optimisation in 10 bins of cluster \(\eta\) (defined by calorimeter geometry, detector acceptances and regions of increasing material in the inner detector) and 11 bins of cluster \(E_{T}\) (from 5 to above 80 GeV). This allows for a proper handling of correlations between variables assuring the highest possible electron efficiency for a given jet rejection (results on efficiency and rejection are given in section 8). The "loose" selection uses the following variables (see also Table 4 for definitions):

* \(R_{had1}\), \(R_{had}\): The distributions of these variables are shown in Fig. 2 for isolated and non-isolated electrons and all background electron candidates. Fig. 3 highlights the \(E_{T}\) dependence of this variable. All layers of the hadronic calorimeter are summed in the region \(|\eta|>0.8\) and \(|\eta|<1.37\) to compensate for the crack between the barrel and extended barrel of the tiles.
* \(w_{\eta 2}\): The distributions of these variables are shown in Fig. 4 for isolated and non-isolated electrons and all background electron candidates. Fig. 5 highlights the \(E_{T}\) dependence of this variable.
* \(R_{\eta}\): The distributions of these variables are shown in Fig. 6 for isolated and non-isolated electrons and all background electron candidates. Fig. 7 highlights the \(E_{T}\) dependence of this variable.

The "medium" selection adds the following shower variables to the "loose" selection (see also Table 4 for definitions):

* \(w_{\rm{sto}}\): The distributions of these variables are shown in Fig. 8 for isolated and non-isolated electrons and all background electron candidates. Fig. 9 highlights the \(E_{T}\) dependence of this variable.
* \(E_{ratio}\): The distributions of these variables shown in Fig. 10 for isolated and non-isolated electrons and all background electron candidates. Fig. 11 highlights the \(E_{T}\) dependence of this variable.

The "medium" selection also includes tracking related cuts (shown in Fig. 13 to 12) which are optimised by considering their robustness for first data:

* The cut on the number of pixel-layer hits and on total number of silicon hits are set to \(\geq 1\) and \(\geq 7\) respectively. These values have shown to provide high efficiency with good rejection while being at the same time quite robust.
* Following a similar argument the cut on the \(\Delta\eta\) matching between the extrapolated track and the cluster \(\Delta\eta_{1}=|\eta_{Calo}^{1star}-\eta_{Track}|\) is set to \(\leq 0.01\). Fig. 13 shows the \(\Delta\eta\) distribution for the different types of electron candidates.
* Finally, the cut on the electron transverse impact parameter \(d_{0}\) is set to \(\leq 5\) mm. \(d_{0}\) is calculated with respect to the beam spot.

### Definition and optimisation of electron "tight" selection

The tight selection is foreseen to achieve high rejection power. The variables added to the "loose" and "medium" selection in the "tight" definition are shown in Fig. 14 and 15 and defined in Table 4. The variables used and cuts applied are the following:

* \(\Delta\phi\) between the cluster position in the second layer of the calorimeter and the extrapolated track. The distribution of this variable is shown in Fig. 14 and the cut value is set to 0.02.
* Cluster energy over track momentum (\(E/p\)). The distribution of this variable is shown in Fig. 14.

* Total number of TRT hits. The difference between the measured number of hits and the expected average number of hits is required to be within 15 hits. This variable is shown in Fig. 14.
* Fraction of high threshold TRT hits. The distribution of this variable is shown in Fig. 15.
* Electrons matching reconstructed conversion photons are rejected. Details on how photon conversions are reconstructed are given in [5]. Fig. 16 shows the conversion bit for all candidates passing the previous tight cuts.

In addition, the tight selection has stricter \(|\Delta\eta|\) (\(<0.005\)) and impact parameter cut (\(<1.0\) mm) than the medium selection.

## 6 Recent changes in electron identification (based on the 2009/2010 LHC data-taking runs)

Since the very early data taking periods in 2009 and the first collisions at 900 GeV [6], the data/Monte-Carlo comparisons have highlighted discrepancies in the shower shape distributions. In particular, the electromagnetic showers are seen to be broader in data than in the Monte-Carlo, which translates into a shift in the relevant distributions (R\({}_{\eta}\) and \(w_{\eta 2}\)). This shift is consistently observed on pure hadronic background (on the very first electron candidates for example) as well as on isolated electrons from W or Z bosons decays (from tag and probe studies). The reason for this discrepancies is not yet clear, though it is believed to be related to the Geant 4 description of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Studies are ongoing on this issue. In order to maintain the robustness of the electron identification criteria in both the trigger and the offline selections, the cuts on R\({}_{\eta}\) and \(w_{\eta 2}\) are loosened. The cut is placed on the tail of the relevant distributions from data, which thus reduces systematics due to a mismodeling of the shapes. In addition, the low \(p_{T}\) selection is improved based on tag and probe studies with J/\(\psi\) decaying to electrons. The probe electron efficiency and the trigger rates versus the shower shape cuts are studied to find the optimum between higher efficiency and acceptable trigger rates.

Other changes include:

* Modification of the hadronic leakage cut due to a change in the modeling of the hadronic calorimeter electronic noise. Based on early data, the electronic noise is now modeled using a double gaussian and is thus wider.
* The tight selection has been adapted to take into account disabled b-layer modules. If the tight candidate electron crosses a disabled b-layer module, it is kept, where as it was rejected in the previous definition of tight. The conversion flag is set if the electron is identified as a conversion. This recovery procedure however did not check the status of the crossed b-layer. Thus tight electrons crossing disabled

Figure 16: Conversion bit (is 1 if the electron candidate is considered a conversion), this particular variable is shown for all candidates passing the full set of cuts (tight) apart from the conversion bitb-layers were identified as single track conversions, and therefore they did not satisfy the standard isEM tight criteria. This problem is now corrected with the new definition of tight.
* As result of broader \(\Delta\eta\) and \(\Delta\phi\) distributions observed in data than in Monte-Carlo due to not yet optimal calo-ID alignment, the new tight selection applies only the looser medium \(\Delta\eta\) cut, while the \(\Delta\phi\) cut is removed from the selection. Improvements are expected on this issue in the near future.

The results for electron efficiency and jet rejection are given in section 8.1.2.

## 7 Electron isolation algorithm

The electron identification described so far does not include dedicated isolation cuts. Various analyses may require different isolation criteria of different tightness and therefore the isolation cuts are applied on top of the electron identification. Different calorimeter and tracking based isolation variables have been studied and optimised. They are used to define a set of reference cuts.

A calorimetric isolation discriminator is computed from the reconstructed energy in a cone of half opening angle \(R_{0}\) around the electron candidate direction, where the energy of the electron itself is excluded. While a larger cone will contain more energy in case of misidentified jets, a smaller cone is more robust against energy depositions from pile-up events. A cone with \(R_{0}=0.3\) has been found to give the best trade-off with high discrimination power and robustness against pile-up at the same time.

In addition, a tracking based discriminator is used, which is the summed scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of tracks in a cone of \(R_{0}=0.3\) around the electron. In contrast to the calorimetric isolation, neutral particles do not contribute to this quantity. The advantage, however, is that track quality criteria can be applied in order to reject tracks from secondary vertices. Track isolation considers tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV, a hit in the innermost pixel detector layer, at least 7 hits in silicon detectors and transverse and longitudinal impact parameter less than 1 mm. For tracks with \(\Delta R<0.1\) with respect to the electron it is also required that they are not matched to a conversion vertex.

When applying cuts on the isolation variables, the dependence of the isolation variables on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) is taken into account by separately optimising the cuts for different regions in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(|\eta|\). Especially for higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges, this procedure is limited by the statistics of the simulated jet sample. To further reduce correlation effects, the described isolation variables are divided by \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) (see Fig. 17).

The electrons which are used for the cut optimisation are required to pass the medium electron identification criteria. The optimisation is done in such a way that the efficiency for isolated electrons, with respect to the pre-selection, is constant in all ranges of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(|\eta|\). Three sets of cuts that exploit calorimetric and tracking isolation variables are part of the recent software releases. Each of them allow to retain 99 %, 98 %, 95 % or 90 % efficiency for isolated electrons. The rejection factors of the isolation cuts in combination with the tight and medium electron identification criteria are discussed in the next section.

## 8 Expected electron reconstruction and identification performance

The expected performance of the ATLAS detector in terms of isolated electron efficiency and jet rejection is summarized here. The full coverage in \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) is studied via known Standard Model processes as well as more exotic models. For Standard Model processes, the electron efficiency is evaluated on the following Monte-Carlo samples:

* A Pythia \(Z\to ee\) sample with a one lepton filter requiring one electron above 0 GeV in \(p_{T}\) within \(|\eta|\leq 2.8\).

* A \(H\to 4l\) sample with a Higgs boson generated at 130 GeV and a generator filter requiring 4 leptons (electrons or muons) with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV within an \(|\eta|\) range of 10.
* A \(J/\psi\to ee\) sample with a generator filter requiring one electron above 3 GeV in \(p_{T}\) within \(|\eta|\leq 2.7\).

The jet rejection is evaluated on the following samples:

* A filtered inclusive di-jet sample of the most important hard processes generated with Pythia including all hard QCD processes (\(qq\to qq\), \(q\bar{q}\to q\bar{q}\), \(q\bar{q}\to gg\), \(qg\to qg\), \(gg\to qq\) and \(gg\to gg\)), heavy flavor production (\(q\bar{q}\to Q\bar{Q}\), \(gg\to Q\bar{Q}\)), prompt photon production (\(q\bar{q}\to g\gamma\), \(q\bar{g}\to q\gamma\)) and W and Z production (\(q\bar{q}\to Z^{0}\), \(q\bar{q}\to W^{\pm}\)). This sample has a jet filter applied at generator level. This filter sums the transverse energy of all stable truth particles (excluding muons and neutrinos) in a grid of \(0.12\times 0.12\) in \(\eta\times\phi\) and looks for a transverse energy deposit greater then 17 GeV within an \(\eta\) range of 2.7.
* A minbias using the same jet filter as described above but with a transverse energy cut at 6 GeV.

Note that the Monte-Carlo used is not corrected for the observed broader shower shapes 6 and since the shift in the shower shapes seems to be consistent for hadron background as well as isolated electrons it is assumed that the all expected jet rejection numbers are underestimated on an un-corrected Monte-Carlo.

Common definitions for electron efficiency and jet rejection are used. The electron identification efficiency is defined as :

\[\varepsilon_{e}^{truth}=\frac{N_{e}^{reco}}{N_{e}^{truth}}, \tag{1}\]

where \(N_{e}^{truth}\) is the total number of true electrons and \(N_{e}^{reco}\) is the number of reconstructed signal electrons matched to true electrons and which pass certain identification cuts, within the same acceptance.

Figure 17: Calorimetric and tracking isolation energy normalised to the transverse energy, \(E_{T}^{\rm cone}/E_{T}\) and \(p_{T}^{\rm cone}/E_{T}\), for a cone of \(R_{0}=0.3\). The electron candidates are required to have a transverse energy larger than 15 GeV and to pass the medium electron identification. The samples used are a Pythia \(Z\to ee\) sample for the signal and a Pythia di-jet sample for the background.

The quoted jet rejections are derived from di-jet samples (filtered at generation level) and are normalised with respect to the number of truth particle jets. The jet rejection is defined as :

\[R_{\rm jet}=\frac{N_{\rm truthjets}}{N_{\rm fakes}}, \tag{2}\]

where \(N_{\rm truthjets}\) is the number of true jets in the initial sample and \(N_{\rm fakes}\) is the number of candidates which pass a certain selection. The filter at generation level sums the transverse energy of particles in a \(0.12\times 0.12\)\(\eta\),\(\phi\) grid. Only the events passing the the filter are going through the full simulation of the ATLAS detector.

Truth jets are defined by summing particle four-momenta within a cone of size \(\Delta R=0.4\) and passing a 1 GeV transverse energy threshold. The number of truth jets per event is derived from a dedicated un-filtered sample of di-jets events. The total number of truth jets is then obtained through:

\[N_{\rm truthjets}=\frac{N_{\rm total}\times F_{\rm jets}}{\epsilon_{\rm filter}}, \tag{3}\]

where \(N_{\rm total}\) is the number of events passing the filter, \(\epsilon_{\rm filter}\) the filter efficiency and \(F_{\rm jets}\) the number of truth jets per generated event. \(F_{\rm jets}\) was determined to be 0.53 for 10 TeV and 0.50 for 7 TeV samples.

Note that the samples used are simulated filtered di-jet events, where all main QCD hard processes, heavy quark production as well as (for the higher ET thresholds) the prompt photon and W, Z production are included.

### High \(p_{T}\) electrons: Standard Model processes

#### 8.1.1 Results of standard selection

The efficiency for the cuts-based identification algorithm is evaluated on a \(Z\to ee\) inclusive sample and is shown in Fig. 18 for the three reference electron identification selections "loose", "medium" and "tight". The results in this section are based on \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV Monte-Carlo samples and do not include the latest changes in electron identification described in Section 6. The efficiency on \(Z\to ee\) for \(E_{T}>20\) GeV is given in Table 5. For \(E_{T}>8\) GeV, efficiency numbers are derived from a \(H\to 4l\) sample and given in Table 6. It should be noted that the efficiency has significantly improved with respect to previous software releases. For similar rejection, the efficiency increases, in the "medium" selection, from 77.3% in previous publications [2] to 90.0% in the present note. This is due to the improvements in the reconstruction described in section 4 as well as the optimisations described in section 5.

Rejection numbers for \(E_{T}>20\) GeV (in Table 5) come from a filtered dijet sample. A filtered minimum bias sample is used to derive the \(E_{T}>8\) GeV numbers (in Table 6).

As can be seen from Table 5, the tight selection at high \(E_{\rm T}\) has a rejection of \((1.39\pm 0.06)\times 10^{5}\) for an efficiency of 71.6 %. This is comparable to previously published expectations [2]. Removing the rejection of reconstructed photon conversions matched to the cluster, results in a loss in rejection of around 45 % for a gain in efficiency of around 3 % and the fraction of background electrons remaining after selection rises to 25 %.

It is interesting to examine the fraction of surviving electron candidates remaining after a corresponding selection criteria. It can be seen in Table 5, that after the tight selection, the largest background contribution to isolated electron from b(c) decays. The second largest contribution is equally shared between hadrons and background electrons from Dalitz decays or photon conversions originating from neutral pion decays. A partial explanation for this can be found in figures 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10 showing the shower shape distributions for b(c) electrons and background electrons coming from photon conversions or Dalitz decays. One can observe that b(c) electrons more closely resemble isolated Z electrons than hadron fakes or background electrons.

#### 8.1.2 Results on recent modification of identification (based on 2009/2010 Run)

The efficiency and rejection numbers presented in Table 7 are based on 7 TeV center-of-mass Monte-Carlo samples. They are based on the more robust identification selection optimised on the latest data taken (see Section 6).

#### 8.1.3 Possible further improvements of the tight selection

Studies are ongoing to further improve the tight selection, by, on one hand, adapting to a better understanding of the various distributions and, on the other hand, introducing new, possibly more optimal variables. The first variables that will be reintroduced in the tight selection are the tighter track matching variables that had initially been removed due to calo-ID misalignment. Moreover, cut optimisation is studied for variables like \(\Delta\phi\) and \(E/p\) (see Section 5.2 for variable definitions). Those two variables are especially affected by Bremsstrahlung and the possibility of using variables corrected for those effects is investigated. In particular, the correlation of \(E/p\) and \(\Delta\phi\) can be used to define a new, Bremsstrahlung corrected, \(E/p\) variable based on the measured \(E/p\), the standard \(\Delta\phi\) between the extrapolated track and the electron cluster and the \(\Delta\phi\) between the track at the perigee and the cluster position. In addition, for the extrapolation to the calorimeter, the standard \(\Delta\phi\) could be improved by using the energy of the calorimeter instead of the track momentum in a simple extrapolation formula.

### High \(p_{T}\) electrons: Beyond the Standard Model processes

Searches beyond the Standard Model usually involve leptons of \(p_{\rm T}\) well above the range used for Standard Model gauge boson physics where data-driven estimations of efficiency can be obtained with the tag-and-probe method. This section considers the electron identification efficiency for exotics (Z' and W', both with a 1.5-TeV mass) and SUSY (SU42, benchmark point in ATLAS for low-mass SUSY production) processes. The \(t\bar{t}\) sample with one lepton filter is also considered since it is the main background for SUSY searches. Table 8 shows the results for efficiency in these samples for \(E_{\rm T}>17\) GeV. Fig. 20 shows the Loose and Medium electron efficiency as a function of the electron \(p_{\rm T}\).

Footnote 2: SU4 is low-mass mSUGRA point which is defined by the following parameters: \(m_{0}=200\) GeV, \(m_{1/2}=160\) GeV, \(A_{0}=400\) GeV, \(\tan\beta=10\) and \(\mu>0\).

As shown, differences of a few percent are found between these results and the reference values obtained with \(Z\) boson samples. For instance, the overall Medium electron efficiency for \(Z^{\prime}\) and \(W^{\prime}\) samples is more than 5% higher than for SUSY or \(t\bar{t}\). Indeed, the results between the different samples can only be compared in bins of variables such as \(p_{\rm T}\), \(\eta\) and isolation, since different topologies in the electron production for each physics process can lead to these differences once integrated over the whole phase space.

### Low \(p_{T}\) electrons from J/\(\psi\)

Table 9 shows the electron reconstruction and identification efficiency obtained for the different standard levels of cuts for electrons from J/\(\psi\). The reconstruction efficiency is \(\sim 71\%\) for a transverse energy

\(E_{T}>5\) GeV. For a tight selection it is \(\sim 45\%\) which correspond to \(\sim 62.8\%\) relative to the reconstruction efficiency. Fig. 21 shows the \(E_{T}\) and \(\eta\) dependence of the identification efficiency.

## 9 Forward algorithm in high \(\eta\) electron studies

The electron identification in the forward region (\(2.5<|\eta|<4.9\)) is essential in many physics analyses, including electroweak measurements and new phenomena searches. In contrast to the central electron, the forward electron reconstruction uses only the information from the calorimeters as the tracking system is limited to \(|\eta|<2.5\). Obviously it is not possible to distinguish between electrons and photons. The forward algorithm is based on topological clusters measured in the various subdetectors of the forward calorimeters and provides energy and position measurement. The selection criteria for high \(\eta\) electrons are based on cluster moments and shower shapes which provide efficient identification due to the good transverse and longitudinal segmentation of the calorimeters. An electron candidate in the forward calorimeters is reconstructed if there is a cluster with \(E_{T}>5\) GeV. The direction of the electron is defined by the barycenter of the cells belonging to the cluster in the calorimeter. The energy of the electron is determined by the sum of the cluster cells.

In order to distinguish electrons from hadrons the difference in the electromagnetic showers induced by the electrons and the hadronic showers induced by the hadron (eg. pion) is exploited. These differences appear in the energy deposition and the shower shape of the two types of particles.

### Optimisation

Most of the variables used as input to the cuts-based identification method are defined as the cluster moments or a combination of them. The cluster moment of degree \(n\) for a variable \(x\) is defined as:

\[\langle x^{n}\rangle=\frac{1}{E_{\mathrm{norm}}}\times\sum_{i}E_{i}\ x_{i}^{n}, \tag{4}\]

where \(E_{\mathrm{norm}}=\sum_{i}E_{i}\) and \(i\) is the cell index of the cluster.

For the electron identification, the following discriminating variables are studied:

* \(r_{i}=\mid(\vec{x}_{i}-\vec{c}^{\prime})\times\vec{s}\mid\): Electromagnetic and hadronic showers have different shapes in both the transverse and the longitudinal directions. Hadronic showers are usually deeper and broader than electromagnetic showers. To evaluate the shower shapes in the transverse direction the second moment of the distance \(r_{i}\) of each cell \(i\) to the shower axis is used. \(\vec{c}\) is the center of the shower and \(\vec{s}\) is the shower axis.
* \(lat_{2}/(lat_{2}+lat_{max})\): Normalized lateral moment, where \(lat_{2}\) is the second moment of the variable \(r_{i}\) for which it is imposed that the distance \(r=0\) for the two most energetic cells. For \(lat_{max}\) it is imposed that \(r=4\) cm for the two most energetic cells and \(r=0\) for the remaining cells.
* \(\lambda_{i}=(\vec{x}_{i}-\vec{c}^{\prime})\cdot\vec{s}\): To evaluate the shower shapes in the longitudinal direction the second moment of the distance of each cell \(i\) to the shower center is used.
* \(long_{2}/(long_{2}+long_{max})\): Normalized longitudinal moment. It takes also into account the two most energetic cells. \(long_{2}\) the second moment of the variable \(\lambda_{i}\) for which the distance \(\lambda=0\) for the two most energetic cells is used. For \(long_{max}\) we impose that \(\lambda=10\) cm for the two most energetic cells and \(\lambda=0\) for the remaining cells.
* \(\frac{1}{E_{\mathrm{norm}}}\times\sum_{i}E_{i}\ (E_{i}/V_{i})\): where \(V_{i}\) id the volume of the cell \(i\). This variable represents the energy density. The EM shower is broader and deposits locally more energy than the hadronic shower.
* \(f_{max}\) Fraction of the energy in the most energetic cell of the cluster. By measuring the energy fractions deposited in the cells of a segmented calorimeter it is usually possible to distinguish incident hadrons from electrons and photons.
* \(\lambda_{center}\) distance of the shower barycenter from the calorimeter front face measured along the shower axis.

A combination of the optimal set of variables should be done from the list of the variables that are shown above. These variables are first classified with respect to their discriminating power. An iterative method was used where one iterates until the best possible efficiency is reached.

For the early LHC running a robust set of variables (and cuts) is also needed. The variable distributions should ideally not depend too strongly on \(E_{T}\) and \(\eta\). The first moment of the energy density variablefrom the optimal list is not fulfilling this requirement (see Fig. 22). Only the remaining 6 variables are kept. Fig. 23 shows the lateral moment for the electrons signal from \(Z\to ee\) events and jet background from QCD induced events.

### Expected performance

Two levels of selection for offline electrons are defined. Loose electrons (using a subset of the previously defined variables with mainly longitudinal and transverse shower profile variables) and tight electrons adding further requirements on shower shapes. The "loose" working point is defined at 74 % efficiency and the tight at 60 % with a fake rate of about 0.13 % and 0.06 % respectively. This performance is expected to yield a clean \(Z\to ee\) sample where one of the electrons is in the forward region. Fig. 24 shows the expected background contribution under the \(Z\) peak for one tight central electron and one loose forward electron. A significance (\(S/\sqrt{B}\)) of 4 can be achieved for about 300 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.

## 10 Conclusion

The assessment of the expected electron performance in the ATLAS experiment over the full acceptance in \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) was performed using the latest reconstruction software and detailed geometry description of the detector. The electron trigger identification variables were described, the electron menus defined and the rates estimated. The offline electron reconstruction algorithms were summarized and the expected performance of the various levels of identification cuts estimated on known Standard Model as well as on more exotic processes. This includes a careful study of the calorimeter and tracking isolation criteria which play a central role in various analysis where different levels of isolation are required. The strict requirements for isolated electron searches are met through a combined reconstruction and identification effort over all calorimeter and tracking subdetectors. We find a mid-range pT efficiency of around 70 % for a rejection of \(10^{5}\) for the central part of the detector (up to 2.5 in \(\eta\)). This extends to the low pT region were the modularity of the cuts allows to have similar rejection with only a small cost in efficiency or equivalent efficiency with slightly lower rejection. The forward region offers in addition an 80 % efficiency on Z boson electrons with good signal/background separation if one electron is required

to be in the central region. This latest estimation of the ATLAS detector performance in terms of electron reconstruction and identification confirms the design requirements. This has been achieved by careful improvements in the reconstruction and identification software adapting to the more accurate description of the detector in the simulation.
