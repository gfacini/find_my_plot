**Abstract**

The B-trigger relies on good quality track reconstruction, both in terms of efficiency and track parameter resolution, at transverse momenta down to \(\sim\)1 GeV. It is important for the trigger to be robust with respect to the effects of misalignment and detector inefficiency. In this note, the effects of pixel, SCT and TRT misalignment are evaluated for three B-trigger channels \(B_{d}^{\circ}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\)\(\pi^{-}\), \(D_{s}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\pi\) and \(J/\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)\(e^{+}\)\(e^{-}\). In addition the effects of pixel and SCT inefficiency have been studied.

Introduction

In this note the possible sources and expected levels of misalignment and inefficiency in the Inner Detector (**ID**) are listed and results are given for their effect on the B-trigger. Previous studies have focussed the effects of misalignment on offline track reconstruction at high \(p_{T}\)[1], [2]. For the B-trigger good track reconstruction efficiency and track parameter resolution must be maintained down to low transverse momenta (\(p_{T}\sim\)1 GeV). These tracks must be reconstructed in the environment of a \(b\)-jet and so pattern recognition considerations are important. For this reason, these studies have been performed with algorithms suitable for the trigger using data from a full GEANT-based simulation. In the trigger, constraints on execution time and trigger rate must be taken into account. These factors may limit the scope for loosening cuts to compensate for misalignment.

The 1D consists of three parts, the **pixel detector**, the Semi-Conductor Tracker (**SCT**) and the Transition Radiation Tracker (**TRT**), see Figure 1. The data for these studies were simulated using the detector geometry described in the ID TDR [3] (section 3). There have been a number of changes since this layout [4], [5], however these are not expected to affect the conclusions drawn from this work.

The pixel detector consists of a **barrel** containing three cylindrical layers and two **end-caps** each with four discs (in the TDR layout). The inner barrel layer (**B-layer**) covers the entire pseudo-rapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\). The outer two barrel layers together with the end-cap discs ensure that tracks traverse two further layers over this pseudo-rapidity range. The transition from barrel to end-cap geometry occurs at \(|\eta|\sim 1.5\). The SCT consists of four cylinders in the barrel and nine discs, of varying radial coverage, in each end-cap. For the SCT, the transition from barrel to end-cap geometry also occurs at \(|\eta|\sim 1.5\). A single SCT detector provides a one-dimensional measurement (in contrast to the two-dimensional measurement provided by the pixels). For this reason, whilst a **pixel module** contains a single silicon wafer, an **SCT module** contains two detectors2 with strips in one detector rotated at a small stereo angle with

respect to the other. An SCT module provides a precise measurement in the R\(\phi\) direction and a lower precision measurement in the second coordinate (z in the barrel and R in the end-caps3).

Footnote 3: The coordinate system used in this note is defined with z along the beam-pipe, the radial direction, R, perpendicular to this and \(\phi\) is the azimuthal angle.

The TRT is composed of straw detectors. In the barrel straw tubes run parallel to the beam-pipe and in the end-caps the straws are arranged radially. Two different length straws are used in the end-caps, longer straws at high \(|z|\), extending to smaller inner radius, ensure coverage to \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\). A track traverses at least 36 TRT straws over most of this pseudo-rapidity range, but there are fewer measurements in the barrel to end-cap transition region at \(|\eta|\sim 0.85\). Straws are grouped into **TRT modules**. In the barrel there are three concentric rings of 32 modules with respectively 19, 24 and 30 straw planes in each ring4. In the end-cap there are 18 wheels each containing two or four sub-wheels with four planes of straws each. The TRT has an electron identification capability based on transition radiation information.

Footnote 4: The modularity of the TRT barrel was not simulated, instead the straws were distributed uniformly in \(\phi\), but this difference is not expected to have a significant affect on the results presented here.

The ID is contained inside a solenoid. For these studies a uniform 2 T field has been used. In practice the field will deviate significantly from uniformity at large z and R, requiring the use of a field map. These issues are not discussed here but are addressed in [2], [6], and [7].

In this note, the effects of inefficiency and misalignment are shown for the level-2 trigger selections for \(B_{d}^{o}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(D_{s}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\pi\) and \(J/\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)\(e^{+}e^{-}\). These will be referred to respectively as the \(B_{d}^{o}(\pi\pi)\), \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) and \(J/\psi(ee)\) triggers and are described in detail in [8]. The selections are based on tracks reconstructed in the pixel and SCT detectors and additionally, for the \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger, the TRT. The aim of these studies is to measure the impact of detector effects on trigger efficiency, using a fixed set of cuts, in order to determine the level of misalignment and inefficiency that can be tolerated in the trigger. In practice cuts are likely to be optimized for the alignment precision achieved. For example, looser cuts could be used to improve efficiency at the price of an increased trigger rate.

## 2 Data Samples

The results presented in this note were produced from data simula

based simulation of the ID using DICE code. The physics simulation was performed using the ATGENB package which is based on PYTHIA. Pile-up of minimum bias events corresponding to low luminosity running (\(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) was added to all data-sets. The generated data contains a simulation of an inefficiency of 3% for the SCT strips, pixels and TRT straws. Noise has been simulated at the level of 0.001% of pixels and 0.003% of SCT strips. Noise has not been simulated in the TRT, but it is not expected to be significant compared to the average hit occupancy (1.5% to 3.5% at low luminosity). More details of the data-set productions can be found in [9]. The data-sets used for the studies reported in this note are listed in Table 1. The \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) and \(J/\psi(ee)\) event samples are the same as those in [8] but larger signal and background samples have been used here for the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) results. The following event samples were derived from these data-sets.

#### Signal sample

All physics selections will contain cuts on the \(p_{T}\) of the tracks considered in the analysis. Hence the signal sample is defined as the sub-set of events from the appropriate signal data-sets after the application of cuts on the true \(p_{T}\) of the B-decay products matching the values of the \(p_{T}\) cuts used in the offline analysis. The values of the \(p_{T}\) cuts are given in Table 1.

The signal data samples do not contain a simulation of the muon detector. For the results presented here, the effect of the muon trigger has been simulated using Monte Carlo truth information. The event is required to have a muon with generated \(p_{T}>6\) GeV produced in the region \(|\eta|<2.5\).

#### Background

A sample of fully simulated \(B\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)X events with pile-up. No additional cuts are applied to the generated event sample. This sample is used to determine trigger rates.

## 3 The Level-2 B-trigger

The B-trigger selection is initiated by a level-1 muon trigger with a \(p_{T}\) threshold of 6 GeV. At level-2 the muon is confirmed or rejected on the basis of data from detectors lying within the RoI defined by level-1. After this selection the rate for this trigger (\(\mu\)6) is about 5 kHz of which about one third is due to \(b\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\) decays. Further rate reduction is achieved by selecting specific channels of interest for physics studies based on tracks found in the ID and, in some cases, extrapolated to the calorimeter and muon systems [8]. This selection is kept as inclusive as possible at level-2 with some more exclusive selections at the Event Filter (EF). The rate reduction is achieved by identifying decay products, for example \(D_{s}\) or \(J/\psi\), characteristic of the channels of interest. In some cases an exclusive reconstruction is necessary, e.g. for \(B_{d}^{\circ}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\)\(\pi^{-}\).

### Track Reconstruction

Since the level-1 trigger muon provides no guidance on the position of the other \(b\)-jet in the event, tracks must be reconstructed within the entire volume of the ID in order to identify the final state decay products. The \(p_{T}\) threshold for this search, \(p_{T}>0.5\) GeV, is determined by the requirement of the \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger for good electron reconstruction efficiency at \(p_{T}>1\) GeV.

The first stage of track reconstruction is a data preparation step which converts the raw data into a suitable format. In this step, firstly **hits** (raw digitizations) on adjacent SCT strips or pixels are grouped into clusters and then clusters from the two stereo layers of a SCT module are associated. Detector geometry information is then used to convert these two-dimensional measurements into three-dimension **space-points** in the ATLAS coordinate system. More details of the data preparation steps can be found in [12].

Two modes of ID track reconstruction have been studied, **pixel-seeded** and **TRT-seeded**, in which reconstruction is initiated by a scan of the whole volume of the pixel detector or TRT respectively. The seed tracks produced by these scans are extrapolated into the SCT and, in the case of TRT seeds, continued into the pixel detector. The TRT-seeded method benefits from the large (\(\sim\)36) number of TRT measurements along a track and the early identification of electron candidate tracks, which can then be treated differently in the extrapolation. Pixel seeds, on the other hand, provide three high precision three-dimensional measurements which, being at low radius, are less affected by material interactions and so provide better guidance for extrapolation into the SCT. As a result, however, pixel-seeded reconstruction is more dependent on the effects of misalignment. The pixel-scan requires space-points in all three layers traversed by the track which gives the trigger a strong dependence on pixel detector efficiency. Pixel-seeded reconstruction has been used for the \(B_{d}^{a}(\pi\pi)\), \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) and \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger studies presented in this note. Additionally, for the \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger, results are shown for the TRT-seeded method.

Since the aim of these studies is to measure the impact of misalignment on efficiency for a fixed set of cuts, the cut values have been chosen to provide reasonable performance over the range of misalignments studied. The track reconstruction and selection steps are described in [8]. The same cut values have been used here, with one exception; the cut on the distance \(\Delta\)z\({}_{3}\) between the track extrapolated from the inner two pixel layers and the hit in the third pixel layer. Distributions of \(\Delta\)z\({}_{3}\) are shown in Figure 2 as a function of misalignment of the pixel barrel in R in (Figure 2 left) and z (right). As a result, a value of 0.1 cm has been chosen for this cut c.f. 0.06 cm used in [8]. This gives no significant change in trigger rates, execution times or efficiencies apart from a small (\(\sim\)2%) loss of \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) trigger efficiency. This is possibly due to increased pattern recognition errors as a result of the larger number of points passing the looser \(\Delta\)z\({}_{3}\) cut. The values of the pixel cuts used in this study are listed in Appendix A.

Figure 2: Distributions of \(\Delta\)z\({}_{3}\) as a function of misalignment of the pixel barrel in R (left) and z (right). Results are shown for no misalignment, and for random misalignments with Gaussian widths of 160 \(\mu\)m and 320 \(\mu\)m.

### B-Trigger Selections

The selections for the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\), \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) and \(J/\psi(ee)\) triggers are described in detail in [8]. The dominant factors affecting trigger efficiency as a function of misalignment differ in the three cases. The \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) selection uses a rather loose mass cut and so is less dependent on track parameter resolution than the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) selection which relies on relatively tight \(\phi\) and \(D_{s}\) mass cuts. However, the lower \(p_{T}\) cut used in the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) trigger means that multiple scattering effects dominate the track parameter resolution up to larger levels of misalignment. The \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger has the lowest \(p_{T}\) cut and so suffers relatively more from multiple scattering effects. In addition the electrons undergo Bremsstrahlung energy loss which causes deviations in the trajectories. As a result the \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger relies on electron identification in the TRT together with a fairly loose set of cuts on reconstructed quantities.

Note that only Level-2 trigger selections are considered here. Selections at the EF make use of secondary vertex reconstruction and transverse impact parameter cuts, but these are not currently used at Level-2.

A summary of the cuts used in the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\), \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) and \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger selections are given below. Signal and background efficiencies are also quoted; these are taken from [8] for the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) and \(J/\psi(ee)\) triggers, but for the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) trigger the efficiencies have been updated based on larger data samples.

### \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) trigger

An event passes the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) trigger selection if it contains at least one opposite charge-sign track-pair satisfying the following criteria:

* each track has \(p_{T}>3.9\) GeV and is separated from the trigger muon in \(\phi\)-\(\eta\) space by \(\Delta\)R\({}_{\phi\eta}\)\(>\) 0.2;
* the sum of \(p_{T}\) for the track-pair satisfies \(p_{T}^{+}\) + \(p_{T}^{-}\)\(>\) 10 GeV
* The z intercepts of the two track trajectories are separated by \(|\Delta\)z\({}_{0}|<2\) cm
* The invariant mass of the track pair, with a pion hypothesis, satisfies 4.3 GeV \(<\) M(\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\)) \(<\) 6.3 GeV

With no misalignment, following these cuts the efficiency for selecting events from the signal sample is 77.5\(\pm\)3.5%. The fraction of events from the background sample selected is 0.93\({}^{+0.31}_{-0.24}\)%.

### \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) trigger

An event passes the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) selection if it contains at least one track triplet satisfying the following criteria:

* each track has \(p_{T}>1.4\) GeV and is separated in \(\phi\)-\(\eta\) space from the trigger muon by \(\Delta\)R\({}_{\phi\eta}\)\(>\) 0.2;
* the triplet contains an opposite charge-sign track-pair with invariant mass (kaon hypothesis) within a 3\(\sigma\) (\(\sigma\) = 5.7 MeV) mass window around the \(\phi\) mass;
* the third track (pion hypothesis) combined with the \(\phi\)-candidate gives an invariant mass within a 3\(\sigma\) (\(\sigma\) = 24.7 MeV) window of the \(D_{s}\) mass.

The signal and background data samples used for the results presented in this note are respectively 2.5 and 3.1 times bigger than those used in [8]. Following the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) selection, with no misalignment, the efficiency for events from the signal sample is 53\(\pm\)1.1%. This is 5% lower than the efficiency quoted in [8] due, in roughly equal parts, to the change in the pixel \(\Delta z_{3}\) cut and a statistical fluctuation as a result of an increased data sample. The fraction of events selected from the background sample is 3.4\(\pm\)0.26%.

#### \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger

The \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger requires that the event contains at least one pair of tracks satisfying the following cuts:

* Each track has \(p_{T}>0.5\) GeV, at least 10 TRT hits and contains a hit in the B-layer.
* The tracks have opposite charge-sign and pass electron identification cuts both individually and as an \(e^{+}e^{-}\) candidate pair (details of the cuts are given in [8]).
* The sum of the \(p_{T}\) values of each track satisfies \(p_{T}^{+}~{}+~{}p_{T}^{-}~{}>3\) GeV.
* The tracks are separated in pseudo-rapidity by \(|\eta|<1.5\) and differ in z-intercept by \(|\Delta z_{0}|~{}<~{}2\) cm.
* The invariant mass of the track pair (electron hypothesis) satisfies 2 GeV \(<~{}M(e^{+}e^{-})~{}<\) 3.8 GeV.

Following these cuts, the signal efficiencies are 51\(\pm\)0.9% using pixel-seeded reconstruction and 52\(\pm\)0.9% for TRT-seeded. The fractions of events selected from the background sample are 7.3\(\pm\)0.6% for pixel-seeded reconstruction and and 10\(\pm\)0.7% for TRT-seeded reconstruction.

## 4 Sources of misalignment and limits on precision

In this section the sources of misalignment are briefly reviewed and order of magnitude estimates given. More details can be found in [13]. Final positional accuracy will depend on survey precision and alignment by tracks. However it is important to also consider build and placement precision as they determine the assumptions that can be made about detector symmetry which in turn influence the size of the constants database required. For example, the size of the Look Up Table (**LUT**) used by a candidate TRT Feature EXtraction (**FEX**) algorithm [14] can be considerably reduced if build errors are sufficiently small to allow rotational symmetry to be assumed. Similarly, if the SCT and pixels contain sufficient symmetry, reductions can be made in the size of the LUTs used for the conversion of hits to space-points [12]. Conversely if, for example, detectors are not sufficiently flat, additional constants will be required to describe the deviations from planarity.

### Build errors

Features on a silicon wafer are expected to be positioned with a precision generally better than 1 \(\mu\)m. Wafers within a module are expected to be aligned to 2-3 \(\mu\)m. However, the SCT detectors can have a curvature giving a variation in the separation of the two detectors in a module by up to 100 \(\mu\)m.

Within a barrel TRT module the end of the wires will be positioned with a precision of 70 \(\mu\)m in R\(\phi\) and R. At the mid-point, z = 0, the wires will be within 250 \(\mu\)m of their nominal position. In the end-cap modules the wires will be located with a precision of 100 \(\mu\)m at the inner and outer radii. X-ray measurements on individual barrel modules after assembly will allow the positions of each wire to be located to 25 \(\mu\)m in the transverse plane at the end-plates and to about 70 \(\mu\)m at z = 0. X-ray measurements will give a precision of about 30 \(\mu\)m for end-cap modules, but a comprehensive X-ray survey of all wires in all modules is not planned.

### Detector Placement Errors

Limits are given in Table 2 for the precision of module placement in the radial direction, R, the direction measuring the azimuthal angle, R\(\phi\), and in the direction parallel to the beam-pipe, z. These requirements refer to placement within a structure, e.g. within a barrel layer or disc. Within each unit (the entire barrel, -z end-cap or +z end-cap) individual barrels, discs and TRT modules should be mounted within 500 \(\mu\)m of their nominal positions.

The precision with which the ID will be centered on the theoretical interaction point is expected to be \(\pm 3\) mm. The rotation with respect to the theoretical beam-line is expected to be \(<1\) mRad (in x, y and z).

#### Survey precision

X-ray survey measurements prior to installation will determine module positions to 10 \(\mu\)m in R\(\phi\) and 50 \(\mu\)m in R and z. However structures may distort by \(\sim\)100 \(\mu\)m when mounted in position on the beam-line. The SCT has an alignment system based on Frequency Scanned Interferometry (FSI) [15] which will determine the relative positions of fixed points on the discs and barrels to about 5 \(\mu\)m. A complete set of measurements will take about 30 minutes.

#### Alignment with tracks

The studies reported in [2] indicate that, for the SCT and pixels, an average precision of 1 \(\mu\)m in R\(\phi\) could be achieved after running for one day at low luminosity. In addition, positions in R and z should be known to 10 \(\mu\)m as a result of X-ray and FSI measurements. Alignment with tracks should give a precision for the TRT of 30 \(\mu\)m with less than one days running [3].

### Magnetic Field

The solenoid may be up to 13 mm from its nominal position in x and y and up to 10 mm from nominal position in z. This gives a worse case rotation of 4 mRad between the field axis and

\end{table}

the theoretical beam axis which would result in a 0.008 T radial field component. However the ID field, in any case, has a radial field component that rises to 0.6 T at large z and R. This necessitates the use of a 3-dimensional field map in track reconstruction. The field map is expected to be measured to a precision of about 0.1% (0.002 T)

### Interaction Point

The interaction region has an RMS size of 16 \(\mu\)m in x and y and about 6 cm in z. In the transverse plane, the interaction point is expected to be within \(\pm\)4 mm of its nominal position. In stable conditions variations of less than 1 mm are expected fill to fill. The beam position within a fill can be controlled to \(\pm\)1\(\mu\)m.

### Offline requirements

The impact of misalignment on offline track parameter resolution has been reported elsewhere [1]. A requirement that, for \(p_{T}=100\) GeV particles, no reconstructed track parameter (\(p_{T}\), \(\theta\), \(\phi\), \(z_{0}\), or \(d_{0}\)) be degraded by more than 20% leads to the limits on pixel and SCT misalignment shown in Table 3. The limits are about 30% looser for a \(p_{T}=\)10 GeV track, and will be looser still for the \(p_{T}\) regime of the B-trigger where multiple scattering effects become significant.

The intrinsic resolution of a TRT straw is 170 \(\mu\)m. A degradation of this resolution to 230 \(\mu\)m would cause a 20% loss of \(p_{T}\) resolution compared to the ideal case [3]. This leads to a limit for the random R\(\phi\) misalignment of a straws of 155 \(\mu\)m (a lower limit would apply to the misalignment of a TRT module as a whole). This is much larger than the expected alignment precision of 30 \(\mu\)m expected using tracks.

Recently, more stringent requirements have been suggested based on the desire to measure the W-mass to 25 MeV [2]. This leads to requirements for average alignment precisions of 1 \(\mu\)m in R\(\phi\) and 10 \(\mu\)m in R and z for the pixels and SCT and about 5 \(\mu\)m in R\(\phi\) for the TRT.

\end{table}
Table 3: Offline requirements: the maximum misalignment giving less than 20% degradation in any offline track parameter [1].

Effect of misalignment on the B-trigger

Misalignment has been simulated by applying Gaussian smearing to the positions of the reconstructed space-points. In each event, each space-point is shifted in R\(\phi\), R or z (or all three directions) using displacements taken randomly from parent distributions with the appropriate Gaussian widths. In these plots, and in the following discussion, **misalignment** refers to the width of the Gaussian. Offline requirements were used to set the scale for the range of misalignments studied. Misalignments were applied in multiples of 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16 times the **unit misalignments** defined in Table 4.

### Pixel misalignment

The effects of misalignment of the pixel detector are shown in Figure 3 for the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) trigger (top), \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) trigger (centre) and \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger (bottom). Pixel-seeded reconstruction has been used in all cases. The figure shows the efficiency for selecting signal events as a function of increasing misalignment. Misalignment has been applied separately to the barrel geometry layers (Figure 3 left ) and end-cap (right). In order to show the effects more clearly, the results of barrel misalignment are shown for \(|\eta|<1.5\), based on the \(|\eta|\) of the parent \(B^{0}\), \(D_{s}\) or \(J/\psi\), and for \(|\eta|>1.5\) in the case of end-cap misalignment. Note, however, that although the effect of misalignment of the B-layer (barrel geometry) is only shown in the left-hand plots, i.e. for \(|\eta|<1.5\), B-layer misalignment will affect tracks over the entire \(|\eta|\) coverage. Three curves are shown on each plot in Figure 3, corresponding to misalignment in R, R\(\phi\) and z. In this and subsequent figures, due to the log scale on the horizontal axis, the zero misalignment point is shown plotted at a misalignment of 1 \(\mu\)m.

Table 5 shows the limits on misalignment which give less than 2% or less than 5% loss of trigger efficiency. A requirement for less than 2% efficiency loss gives a R\(\phi\) limit of 18 \(\mu\)m for the barrel geometry pixel layers and of 60 \(\mu\)m for the end-caps. With the chosen cuts, the corresponding limits on misalignment of the barrel (end-cap respectively) pixels in R is 170 \(\mu\)m (120 \(\mu\)m) and the limit in z is 180 \(\mu\)m (1000 \(\mu\)m). If a tighter \(\Delta z_{3}\) cut is used, the limits on misalignment in R and z are reduced. Figure 4 shows a comparison of efficiency as a function of misalignment of the pixel barrel for the chosen \(\Delta z_{3}\) cut of 0.1 cm and a lower value of 0.06 cm.

The effect of pixel misalignment on the trigger is primarily due to a reduction in reconstruction efficiency. Figure 5 shows the efficiency to reconstruct all three daughters (K, K, \(\pi\)) of the \(D_{s}\) as a function of pixel R\(\phi\) misalignment. Since the pixel F

in all three planes traversed by the track, efficiency falls rapidly with increasing misalignment due to points which fail the cuts for association to track candidates.

Since a loss of reconstruction efficiency is the dominant effect of pixel misalignment on the trigger, curves of efficiency as a function of pixel misalignment for background events, shown in Figure 6 (left), show a similar trend to the curves for signal events. Hence, when selection cuts remain unchanged, an increase in pixel misalignment, above some level, gives a decrease in trigger rate. In practice, however, cuts are likely to be optimized for the alignment precision ultimately achieved; a higher level of misalignment might lead to looser selection cuts being chosen to maintain efficiency giving an increase in trigger rate.

### SCT misalignment

Since track reconstruction requires only a minimum of two SCT space-points on a track out of four planes typically traversed by a particle, track reconstruction efficiency is less dependent on SCT misalignment than pixel misalignment. This is shown in Figure 5 which compares the efficiency to reconstruct all three daughters of the \(D_{s}\) as a function of SCT misalignment with the results for pixel misalignment. No loss of reconstruction efficiency is seen over the range of misalignments tested. As a consequence, the \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger is insensitive to the effects of SCT misalignment within the range of misalignments tested and the \(B_{d}^{o}(\pi\pi)\) trigger, which has only a loose mass-window cut, is also relatively insensitive to the effects of misalignment. The efficiency for background events is independent of misalignment over the range studied, see Figure 6 (right).

The effects of SCT misalignment on the efficiencies of the \(B_{d}^{o}(\pi\pi)\) and \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) triggers (pixel-seeded reconstruction) are shown in Figure 7. No significant reduction of \(B_{d}^{o}(\pi\pi)\) trigger efficiency is observed for SCT end-cap misalignments over the range studied, and for the SCT barrel only R\(\phi\) misalignments by more than 100 \(\mu\)m cause a significant loss of efficiency. The limits on misalignment shown in Table 5 are, therefore, determined by the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) trigger. A 2% loss of efficiency is seen for a R\(\phi\) misalignment of 70 \(\mu\)m (100 \(\mu\)m) in the barrel (end-cap, respectively). No significant loss of efficiency is seen in either the barrel or end-cap for R and z misalignments in the range studied.

The dominant factor affecting the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) trigger efficiency as a function of SCT misalignment is a degradation in track parameter resolution, important due to the relatively tight \(D_{s}\) and \(\phi^{0}\) mass cuts. SCT misalignment has a greater impact on track parameter resolution than pixel misalignment due to the larger measurement radius. The width of the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) mass peak is shown in Figure 8 as a function of SCT misalignment. There is degradation of mass resolution with misalignment in R\(\phi\). A 20% increase in the \(D_{s}\) mass width occurs for a R\(\phi\) misalignment of 55 \(\mu\)m in the barrel and 96 \(\mu\)m in the end-caps. Since the width of the \(D_{s}\) mass-window was fixed at a value based on the mass resolution at zero misalignment, the degradation in mass resolution with R\(\phi\) misalignment leads to a loss of trigger efficiency. There is a similar effect with the \(\phi\) mass-window cut. If, instead, wider mass windows were used, efficiency could be improved at higher levels of misalignment, but with an increase in trigger rate. As an example, a 50% increase in the width of the mass window gives almost a factor of 2 increase in trigger rate.

### TRT misalignment

The effect of TRT misalignment on the \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger is shown in Figure 9 for both pixel-seeded and TRT-seeded reconstruction. For clarity, separate plots are shown for the barrel (\(|\eta|<0.9\)) and end-caps (\(|\eta|>0.9\)), based on the \(|\eta|\) of the \(J/\psi\). The resulting limits on TRT misalignment are given in Table 5.

In pixel-seeded mode the TRT has only been used for electron identification. In TRT-seeded mode, the TRT tracks additionally provide seeds for extrapolation into the SCT and pixels. In both cases only SCT and pixel points have been included in the fits to determine the final track parameters. As a result, in pixel-seeded mode, the trigger is insensitive to TRT misalignment, with less than 2% loss of efficiency over the range of misalignments tested. In TRT-seeded mode, the precision of the TRT track in R\(\phi\) is important in providing guidance for the extrapolation into the SCT. As a result, a 2% loss of trigger efficiency is seen for an R\(\phi\) misalignment of 1200 \(\mu\)m for the barrel and 900 \(\mu\)m for the end-caps.

Misalignment has been applied simultaneously in R, R\(\phi\) and z in multiples of the values quoted in Table 4 which are based on offline limits.

### Comparison with Offline requirements

In Figure 10 the efficiencies of the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\). \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) and \(J/\psi(ee)\) triggers (pixel-seeded reconstruction) are shown as a function of misalignment applied simultaneously in R, R\(\phi\) and z. The Gaussian widths used to derive the misalignments in each direction are multiples of the values given in Table 4 which are based on offline limits on misalignment. Three curves are shown on each plot corresponding to misalignment of the pixels, SCT and both the SCT and pixels. Results are shown separately for misalignment of the barrel (Figure 10 left) and end-caps (right). It is pixel alignment that is the most important factor for the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) and \(J/\psi(ee)\) triggers. A 2% loss of \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) triggers is seen for a misalignment of \(\sim\)2 (\(\sim\)4) times the Table 4 values for the pixel barrel (end-cap, respectively). The \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger is less sensitive to pixel misalignment; a 2% loss is seen for barrel (end-cap, respectively) pixel misalignments of \(\sim\)5 (\(\sim\)10) times the Table 4 values.

For the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) trigger, both pixel and SCT alignment have an effect. A 2% loss of \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) triggers is seen for SCT misalignments of \(\sim\)5 times the Table 4 values and for barrel (end-cap, respectively) pixel misalignments of \(\sim\)5 (\(\sim\)8) times these values.

The effect of ID misalignment on TRT-seeded reconstruction is shown for the \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger in Figure 11. A 2% loss of triggers is seen for misalignments of the TRT barrel (end-cap, respectively) of \(\sim\)8 (\(\sim\)4) times the Table 4 values.

Figure 12 shows the effect of misalignment applied simultaneously in R, R\(\phi\) and z on the width of the \(B_{d}\) mass peak in \(B_{d}^{\circ}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) events (Figure 12 left) and on the width of the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) mass peak in \(B_{s}^{\circ}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) events (Figure 12 right). SCT R\(\phi\) alignment is the most important factor affecting the mass resolution. A 20% increase in the width of the \(B_{d}\) mass peak is seen for a misalignment of \(\sim\)2 times the Table 4 values. A similar degradation of the \(D_{s}\) mass resolution is seen for a misalignment \(\sim\)4 times the offline limits. The \(D_{s}\) mass resolution is less affected by SCT misalignment since a lower \(p_{T}\) threshold is applied and so multiple scattering effects dominate up to higher levels of misalignment.

The curves show the efficiencies predicted by a simple model, see text.

Effect of inefficiency

The datasets used here and in [8] include, as part of the simulation, a 3% inefficiency of SCT strips, pixels and TRT straws. For this note, the effect of additional inefficiency has been studied. Inefficiency has been simulated in two ways:

* **hit deletion:** random deletion of a given fraction of hits;
* **space-point deletion:** random deletion of a given fraction of space-points.

Hit deletion simulates the effect of dead SCT readout strips or pixels or dead read-out channels. In some cases an entire read-out chip or a whole detector could be faulty. This effect is simulated by space-point deletion.

The effect of deleting space-points is shown in Figure 13 for both the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) trigger and \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) triggers. Separate plots are shown for pixel inefficiency and SCT inefficiency. Note that the same data-sets have been used for each inefficiency point (with successively more space-points deleted as inefficiency increases). This explains the relatively smooth variation seen as a function of inefficiency as compared to the statistical errors in the efficiency measurements (given in Section 3.2). A loss of 1% of pixel space-points leads to a 5% loss of efficiency for the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) trigger and 4% for the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) trigger. A loss of SCT space-points has a much smaller effect than the deletion of the same fraction of pixel space-points. When 1% of SCT space-points are deleted there is no loss of events from the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) sample and only a 0.2% loss of trigger efficiency for \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\).

The basic behavior of efficiency as a function of the fraction of deleted space-points can be predicted using a simplified model which ignores the effects of pattern recognition and assumes a uniform coverage of 3 pixel layers and 4 SCT layers. In fact there are deviations from this uniform coverage due to overlaps and gaps between detectors. Since the pixel FEX used in these studies requires space-points in all three layers traversed by the track, in this simplified model, the trigger efficiency would be expected to fall as \(\varepsilon(x_{\mathit{pix}})=\varepsilon_{0}(1-x_{\mathit{pix}})^{3N}\) where \(x_{\mathit{pix}}\) is the fraction of pixel points deleted, \(\varepsilon_{0}\) is a normalization factor and N is the number of tracks required by the trigger i.e. \(N=2\) for \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) and \(N=3\) for \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\). The normalization factor takes into account the 3% inefficiency, which is part of the simulation, as well as losses due to pattern recognition effects and due to the trigger selection cuts. A particle generally traverses four layers of the SCT; the trigger selection requires at least two SCT points on the reconstructed track. As a result, the trigger efficiency is much less sensitive to SCT inefficiency and, in the simplified model, would be expected to follow: \(\varepsilon(x_{\mathit{SCT}})=\varepsilon_{0}\,((1-x_{\mathit{SCT}})^{4}+4x_{ \mathit{SCT}}(1-x_{\mathit{SCT}})^{3}+6x_{\mathit{SCT}}^{2}(1-x_{\mathit{SCT} })^{2})^{N}\), where \(x_{\mathit{SCT}}\) is the fraction of SCT space-points deleted.

The curves derived from the above equations are shown superimposed on the plots in Figure 13 where the normalization, \(\varepsilon_{0}\), is the efficiency at the first point (0.1% deleted space-points). The curves are in good agreement with the measured points (stars) for the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) trigger, but the agreement is less good for the \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) trigger. The failure of the curves to completely reproduce the trends shown by the points results from the simplifications listed above. Another factor, leading to a higher efficiency than that predicted by the simple model, is that a fake combination of tracks may cause the event to trigger even though one or more tracks from the \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) or \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\) decay has not been reconstructed.

Figure 13 also shows the effect of deleting hits. A loss of 1% of pixel hits leads to a reduction in trigger efficiency of 2% for both \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) and \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\). A loss of 1% of SCT hits causes no measurable effect. The loss of a given fraction of pixel hits has a smaller effect than the loss of the same fraction of space-points since a pixel space-point is formed from a cluster which, in a

A reduced efficiency for detecting transition radiation hits has been simulated by removing the high-threshold flag for a given fraction of TR-hits. The efficiency of the \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger is shown in Figure 15 as a function of the fraction of TR-hits converted to low-threshold hits, for a constant set of cuts. A loss of 1% of TR-hits causes a 0.9% loss of trigger efficiency in both the barrel and end-caps. As expected, due to the lower average number of TR-hits, efficiency falls more rapidly with the removal of barrel TR-hits than for the end-caps.

## 7 Future Work

The effects of misalignment on the selections at the EF have yet to be studied. These selections are expected to be more sensitive to misalignment than the level-2 selections since, at the EF, track reconstruction is repeated using offline-type algorithms and tighter cuts are applied. Secondary decay vertices are reconstructed and cuts applied to the fit quality of the reconstructed vertex as well as cuts on transverse decay lengths. Studies of misalignment and inefficiency should be extended to the EF. These measurements may also be relevant to level-2 as it is possible that the use of vertex reconstruction might be extended to level-2.

## 8 Conclusion

In this note the effects of misalignment and inefficiency have been measured for example level-2 selections for \(B^{o}_{d}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(D_{s}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\pi\) and \(J/\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)\(e^{+}e^{-}\). The most constraining limit is for R\(\phi\) alignment of the pixel B-layer and pixel barrel layers, for which a misalignment with a Gaussian width of 18 \(\mu\)m gives up to 2% loss of trigger efficiency. For the pixel end-caps, SCT barrel and SCT end-caps the limits on misalignment are 60 \(\mu\)m, 70 \(\mu\)m and 100 \(\mu\)m respectively

Figure 15: The efficiency of the \(J/\psi(ee)\) trigger as a function of the fraction (%) of TR-hits converted to low-threshold hits. Results are shown separately for the barrel, \(J/\psi\) produced at \(|\eta|<0.9\), and end-caps, \(|\eta|>\) 0.9.

for \(<2\%\) loss of trigger efficiency. It is anticipated that this precision can be achieved by a combination of survey and FSI measurements during running. The final R\(\phi\) precision attainable using alignment by tracks is not necessary for the level-2 selections described here, which do not make use of vertex reconstruction or decay length cuts. Furthermore, the trigger efficiencies are relatively insensitive to misalignment of the pixels and SCT in the R and z directions. The trigger selections studied are insensitive to TRT misalignments of up to \(\sim\)1 mm.

The trigger efficiency is insensitive to SCT efficiency, but is strongly dependent on pixel efficiency. This is a consequence of the present pixel-scan algorithm which requires measurements in all three layers traversed by the track. A 1% loss of pixel efficiency results in a 2% loss of trigger efficiency for both \(B_{d}^{\circ}(\pi\pi)\) and \(D_{s}(\phi\pi)\). TRT-seeded reconstruction is expected to show a weaker dependence on detector efficiency, however, for electron-based triggers, the efficiency for high threshold TR-hits is important.

A pixel-scan algorithm is under development which will additionally make use of SCT information. This will greatly reduce the dependence of the trigger on pixel efficiency and so result in a trigger that is insensitive to misalignment and inefficiency at levels that can be reasonably expected during running.

## Appendix A Pixel cuts

The pixel full-scan algorithm takes as input the pixel cluster positions produced by a separate data preparation step [12]. In the first step of the full-scan algorithm, clusters are combined in pairs. All cluster-pair combinations are tested with one cluster in the innermost layer (B-layer) and one cluster in the next barrel layer or in one of the two innermost end-cap discs. The trajectory is extrapolated inwards to give the distance of closest approach to the origin in the R\(\phi\) plane, \(\Delta\)R\(\phi_{12}\), and in the z direction, \(\Delta\)z\({}_{V}\). The interaction point is taken to be the origin in the R\(\phi\) plane and the z-position is given by the trigger muon. Due to the different geometry, different cuts are applied to the two quantities \(\Delta\)R\(\phi_{12}\) and \(\Delta\)z\({}_{V}\) depending on whether the second cluster is in the barrel or end-cap. Surviving track candidates are extrapolated outwards to search for nearby clusters in the third barrel layer or one of the outer two end-cap discs. Cuts are applied to the distance between the extrapolated track and third cluster position in the R\(\phi\) plane, \(\Delta\)R\(\phi_{3}\), again separate cuts are applied for the barrel and end-caps. Cuts are only applied in the z direction, \(\Delta\)z\({}_{3}\), for the barrel. In both selection steps the extrapolation is linear. Details of the pixel-scan algorithm are given in [16]. The pixel cuts used for the results presented in this note are given in Table 6.
