Tungsten alloys have not seen extensive use in liquid argon calorimeters so far. Because the manufacturing process for tungsten is different from the more common metals used in liquid argon there is concern that tungsten could poison the argon thereby creating difficulties for precision calorimetry. In this paper we report measurements of outgassing from the tungsten alloy slugs proposed for use in the ATLAS FCal module and estimate limits on potential poisoning with reasonable assumptions. This estimate gives an upper limit poisoning rate of \(\leq 2\) ppb/yr into a volume of liquid argon equal to the volume of tungsten slugs.

Is it possible that tungsten alloys used in the ATLAS Forward Calorimeters could poison the liquid argon? Because the signal produced by the ATLAS ionization sampling calorimeters relies on drifting electrons in the liquid argon sensitive medium, any electro-negative contaminants (poisons) would reduce the signal. Some information on poisoning can be deduced by measuring the outgassing rate in vacuum of the suspect material, tungsten in this case. Such outgassing rates can provide tight upper limits on potential poisoning because most poisons are gasses at room temperature. If the type of gas is not determined then upper limits are all that can be obtained because 1) most gasses do not poison the argon and 2) many gasses solidify at liquid argon temperatures and do not mix with the argon.

At Arizona we set up a test facility to measure outgassing from the tungsten slugs purchased from MiTech by Toronto for the maquette. A schematic of the setup is shown in Figure 1. The tungsten alloy slugs were loaded into the "T" fixture (the test compartment) connecting the Huntington Mechanical Laboratories EV-150 O'ring sealed valve and the INFICON IPN 850-675-G1 hot cathode ionization gauge. A copper mesh prevented theslugs from migrating towards the valve. After pumping with a Leybold TURBOVAC 50 turbo pump (backed by a Leybold TRIVAC D 1,6 B forepump) to a good vacuum the valve was closed and the rate of increase of the pressure, due to outgassing, was measured. The same procedure was followed when the slugs were removed from the test compartment to determine the baseline.

Table I shows the surface areas and volumes of the relevant components of the vacuum system. The total in the table includes the surface area and volume exposed to the gauge when the valve is closed but excluding the sample tungsten slugs which are listed separately. The surfaces of the vacuum system are stainless steel and glass. Conflat copper gaskets were used at all flanges except for the O'ring seal in the valve. But because the vacuum pump was generally left on even when the valve was closed, there was vacuum on both sides of this O'ring seal and so no significant possibility of leaks. In the rare instances when the turbo pump was off, no increase in pressure at the gauge was observed over the case with the turbo pump on. We never took data with the forepump off.

The MiTech tungsten alloy slugs came in plastic bags from the manufacturer. The bags were opened and the slugs were handled before this test. Immediately before the test the slugs were bathed in acetone. A baking procedure was refined over the months the tests were conducted. The test compartment, with the slugs, was baked at temperatures up to 300\({}^{\circ}\)C. The ionization gauge was baked separately. We learned much about vacuum systems during this time.

Figure 2 shows the pressure, as measured by the ionization gauge, as a function of time after the valve was closed. It is clear that the pressure build-up is not uniform. In fact the pressure dropped initially, perhaps because the ionization gauge also acts as a getter. Other complicated effects likely contribute to the structure seen in these curves. A run ended when the pressure approached \(10^{-4}\) torr because the outgassing rates were so low that a run would become unacceptably long if we waited for the pressure to reach a higher value. The later runs show better vacuums because of longer and hotter baking.

Data taken before the extensive baking are shown in Figure 3 on a linear scale. There is little difference in the outgassing rates with the slugs in the test compartment and with the compartment empty. However this data is not as sensitive as later results.

Because the outgassing rate, as measured by the ionization gauge, is not at all constant we have chosen to summarize the data by taking an average rate of pressure change over each run. The average starts at the best pressure achieved during the bakeout and ends at approximately \(10^{-5}\) torr. We estimate that this averaging introduces uncertainties of order a factor 2 in the outgassing rates observed due to different initial conditions.

Figure 4 summarizes our earlier work. Each datapoint in this and in succeeding plots represents an average over a complete run such as the runs shown in Figure 2 and 3. The first series of runs with the slugs in the test compartment (filled circles) shows slow improvement with baking of the test compartment after an initial drop. During this series we discovered that baking the ionization gauge, however, leads to big improvements. We next emptied the compartment and started another series of runs represented by open circles in Figure 4. When we baked the gauge the outgassing rate improved rapidly. When we baked the compartment (now empty) the outgassing rate sometimes did not improve at all and even got worse. So we pushed as far as we could and achieved an excellent 'empty compartment' outgassing rate slightly better than \(10^{-10}\) torr/min. We decided to fill the compartment again with slugs to see if we could improve on the earlier series now that our procedure was settling down. This series is represented by the closed squares. Here we baked only the gauge.

Apparently the ionization gauge accumulates volatile substances while the container is open. In discussions with colleagues who work with vacuum systems we were informed that ionization gauges must be baked extensively to work well in high vacuums. Having learned that what we discovered was well known by the vacuum community we then standardized to an improved technique. For each run we first baked the gauge. Figure 5 shows some of our experiments to determine the length of time necessary to bake the gauge. Because the slugs block the path between the gauge and the vacuum pump the gauge baking time is considerably longer when the slugs are in the test compartment.

Figure 6 summarizes the results of many series of runs done since we standardized our techniques. Shown are the starting outgassing rates before gauge baking and the final outgassing rates after optimal gauge baking for each series. Two empty compartment series are interspersed with tungsten-loaded compartment series. Of course only the outgassing rates after optimal gauge baking are relevant. There is some variation from series to series and some hint that the empty compartment series are better but we cannot be certain of this. One could argue that there is no clear difference between the compartment-empty and compartment-full series. The variation from series to series may be related to environmental changes in the laboratory. While Tucson, Arizona is noted for very low humidity, these data were taken during our monsoon season when the humidity increases to levels more commonly seen in other parts of the world.

We therefore conservatively take the outgassing rate of \(4\times 10^{-10}\) torr/min as the upper limit due to the tungsten slugs. This translates to \(\sim 2\times 10^{-4}\) torr/yr. Assuming the gas is air (\(\rho=1.29\) mg/cm\({}^{3}\) at 1 atmosphere and room temperature) the outgassing rate is \(0.3\times 10^{-8}\) g/cm\({}^{3}\)/yr into a volume equal to the slug volume. This corresponds to \(\sim 2\times 10^{-3}\) ppm/yr by weight of air into a volume of liquid argon equal to the slug volume, a standard we will adopt for comparisons. It is likely that the liquid argon will be slowly recirculated through a filter and that contaminants will be removed on a time scale faster than one year. In any event, even if all of the gas is actually oxygen, this is a very acceptable poisoning rate. And remember that this is an upper limit.

**Figure Captions**

1) Schematic diagram of the vacuum setup at Arizona used to measure the outgassing rate of tungsten alloy slugs. The slugs were inserted through the bottom flange of the "T" connecting the valve and the ionization gauge. We call this the test compartment. Slugs were prevented from sliding into the valve chamber by a copper wire mesh (screen).

2) Ionization gauge pressure in torr with the test compartment filled with 530 slugs versus time after the valve was closed to the turbo pump. The successive runs were with improved baking of the compartment and, more importantly, of the ion gauge.

3) Ionization gauge pressure in torr versus time for 530 slugs in the test compartment (solid triangles) and for an empty compartment (open diamonds) after pumping but no baking.

4) Ionization gauge pressure change in torr/minute versus clock time under different conditions of compartment and gauge baking.

5) Ionization gauge pressure change in torr/minute versus the time the gauge was baked. During the baking the valve was open so that the test compartment and gauge volumes were being pumped out. At each data point the gauge was allowed to cool down to ambient temperature and the valve was closed so that the outgassing rate could be measured. When the slug were in the test compartment the path between the gauge volume and the pump was largely blocked so that pumping was especially slow.

6) Ionization gauge pressure change in torr/minute at the beginning and end of several of the later series of runs. Between beginning and end the gauge was baked. Only the data at the end is relevant as only then has the ionization gauge been properly treated.
