We report on the WLS fibre quality control (QC) procedure developed in Pisa. We have built and put into operation a set up and an analysis procedure which allow a fast and accurate measurement of both light yield and attenuation length of 18 WLS fibres at once. We have measured the overall accuracy of our method to be 1.5% in the measurement of light yield and 3% of the attenuation length. We report also on the results obtained with this method in the QC of fibres of the first batch recently delivered by Kuraray.

Introduction

In this note we describe in detail the experimental apparatus built and put into operation in Pisa to perform the QC of WLS fibre which we are receiving from Kuraray and which will be installed in the Tile Cal calorimeter modules in the forthcoming years. The total number of fibres needed for Tile Cal sums up to about six hundreds thousands and we are obliged to make a test of a sample of the fibres. Hoverer the number of fibres to be measured is still of the order of several thousands and our previous methods for fibre characterization which can test one fibre at the time [1][2][3][4] and which provides also accurate information on absolute quantities such as number of photoelectrons [5], cannot be used. We developed then, a procedure which allows the measurement of many fibres at once in a fast way still keeping a good accuracy. The measurements include:

* the attenuation length for distances larger that 70 cm;
* the light yield at 140 cm.

Particular care is devoted to calibrate the light source (a blue LED) and the PM gain variation by the use of two well known reference fibres that were kept untouched along all measurements and whose light yield is used as normalization for all the fibres under test. The overall precision achieved is 1.5% for the light yield and 3% for the attenuation length.

The procedure described here was applied to fibres from the first batch recently delivered by Kuraray and it will be shown that its precision was adequate to discover that fibres from one preform (out of 11) did not satisfy our QC requirements.

Finally we will show also the results of a simple statistical analysis performed to investigate the consequences on the acceptance/rejection procedure of future fibres, due to our QC requirements.

## 2 The experimental apparatus

The setup used for the QC measurements is sketched in figure 1. It consists of an alluminium plate 2 m long installed on a precision test bench inside a dark room. The alluminium plate was machined to obtain 20 parallel V-shaped grooves that will house the 20 WLS fibres under test. The distance between grooves is 1 cm. The light source is a blue LED (\(\lambda\)=500 nm) DC operated. The LED was kept at about 20 cm from the fibres inside a case and its light was collimated with a 0.7 mm slit to form a light pencil. The LED system was positioned an a precision x-y table moved in precise steps under computer control.

The light collection is performed via 20 clear fibres (2 mm in diameter) facing one edge of the WLS fibres. The light of the 20 clear fibres is collected to a single PM (Hamamatsu H3178). The PM current signal is read out by a digital voltmeter (Keithley 2001) with an integration time of 30 ms.

## 3 The measurement procedure

The fibre scanning is performed by moving the light source both in x and y coordinate (the analogous set up developed at LIP [6], instead, moves the table housing the fibres, in x coordinate). The steps are:

* along the fibre (x-coordinate) 10 cm from 70 to 170;
* across the fibre (y-coordinate) 0.1 mm.

At a given x, the scanning across the fibres produces 20 peaks of photocurrent corresponding to the 20 fibres (see figure 2 left plot). Figure 2 right

plot shows the detail of a single peak. The light yield of the fibre is defined as the maximum value of individual peaks. By repeating several scanning across the fibre we found that the fluctuation in peak finding is below 0.9%.

Figure 3 is an example of an attenuation curve of a fibre fitted by a single exponential between 70 and 170 cm; the quality of the fit is generally good.

Measurement precision

We have monitored carefully the stability and the precision of our measurements by checking the following quantities:

* _Light source variations_. This is monitored by continuously measuring the DC current flowing in the LED: the current stability was kept within 0.1% and corresponds to negligible variations of the light yield of the LED.
* _PMT gain variations_. The signals from the all fibres are always referred to the signal from two reference fibres which where kept untouched along all measurements. The ratio of the signals of the two reference fibres are in turn used as stability monitor, we measured a stability within 0.8%.
* _Channels intercalibration_. Each channel was intercalibrated with all the others by measuring the same fibre in all channels: this intercalibration was performed with several fibres and an average individual calibration constant per channel was extracted. Figure 4 (upper plot) shows the response of a particular fibre measured in different channels before and after the correction for the channel calibration. Figure 4 lower plots show the dispersion in light yield before (left plot) and after (right plot) the channel calibration correction: figure 4 lower right shows that the final dispersion and therefore precision in light yield is (RMS) 1.3%.

Figure 5 shows the values in attenuation length obtained by measuring the same fibre in different channel. The dispersion in this case is (RMS) 3.4% which, therefore, indicates the accuracy in the measurement of this parameter.

Quality control of the first batch of fibres from Kuraray

Recently we received from Kuraray about 25000 fibres from 11 different preforms for the QC procedure. From each preform we sampled randomly 18 fibres 2.0 to 2.23 m long depending on the preform. Each fibre was labeled, cut at one end by a diamond cutting machine and blackened at the other end. The quality of the fibre in terms of light yield and attenuation length was then investigated with the set up described above.

Figure 6 is an example of these measurements. The figure shows respectively the measured light yield and attenuation length for each of the 18 fibres (channels 2-10 and 11-20) and the two reference fibres housed in channels 1 and 11. Figure 6 shows also the distributions of attenuation length and light yield for this preform. The fibres from this preform are in excellent agreement with the reference ones: the average values are within 3% and 1% from the values of the reference fibres for the attenuation length and light yield respectively. The relative spread is 5% and 3% for attenuation length and light yield respectively. Another example of QC analysis is presented in figure 7 for fibres of preform n. 4: again the quality of the fibres is excellent.

In contrast we show in figure 8 the situation for fibres from preform n. 8. The average values and the spread for both parameters are rather poor, with individual fibres which are lower up to 20% in light yield and lower up to 40% in attenuation length compared to the reference fibres. We have repeated the measurements using two more sets of 18 fibres from preform 8 (the last set of fibre are from the batch of 193 cm) and the results did not change (see figures 9 and 10).

Figure 11 summarizes results of the average attenuation length for all preforms (the error bars indicate the RMS of each distribution). It is clear that the 3 measurements of fibres from preform 8 give, both in absolute value and in dispersion, much worse results. Figure 12 summarizes the results for the light yield and again preform 8 for at least 2 sample is worse both in absolute value and in dispersion.

## 6 Criteria for preform acceptance

We assume that the fibres of this first batch (180 fibres excluding preform 8) represent the reference sample for the future fibres to be accepted or rejected. The statistical characteristics of these fibres for the light yield are:

1. average light yield \(L_{ref}=0.986\);
2. RMS of the means of the preforms \(\sigma_{Lref}=0.015\);
3. RMS of all (180) fibres \(\Delta L_{fibres}\)=0.033.

Similarly for the attenuation length:

1. average attenuation length \(\lambda_{ref}\)=331 cm;
2. RMS of the means of the preforms \(\sigma_{\lambda ref}\)=11 cm;
3. RMS of all (180) fibres \(\Delta\lambda_{fibres}\)=18 cm.

Figure 10: _Light yield and attenuation length measured from additional 18 fibres from preform AP008._Figure 11: _Summary of average attenuation length for 11 tested preforms, the errorbars indicate the RMS of the distributions._

Figure 12: _Summary of average light yield for 11 tested preforms, the errorbars indicate the RMS of the distributions._

Assume that \(\lambda\) is the measured average value of the attenuation length of a given preform, \(\sigma_{\lambda}\) its dispersion and \(\lambda_{i}\) the attenuation length of individual fibres \(L\), \(\sigma_{L}\) and \(L_{i}\) are the average light yield, its dispersion and light yield of individual fibres. We propose the following 6 criteria for preform acceptance:

1. \(L/L_{ref}>0.95\)
2. \(\sigma_{L}\,/L<0.055\)
3. \(L_{i}\,/L_{ref}>0.9\) any \(i\)
4. \(\lambda/\lambda_{ref}>0.9\)
5. \(\sigma_{\lambda}/\lambda<0.075\)
6. \(\lambda_{i}\,/\lambda_{ref}>0.84\) any \(i\)

To study which would be the probability of rejection of a good preform because of chance effects, we have run a simple MonteCarlo program. We have simulated 100000 preforms whose average \(\lambda\) and L are Gaussian distributed with mean values \(\lambda_{ref}\) and \(L_{ref}\) and widths \(\sigma_{\lambda ref}\) and \(\sigma_{Lref}\) respectively. We have used for \(\lambda_{ref}\), \(L_{ref}\), \(\sigma_{\lambda ref}\) and \(\sigma_{Lref}\) the values measured in Batch1 (preform 8 excluded). Then we sorted 6, 9 or 18 individual fibres where \(\lambda_{i}\) and \(L_{i}\) are obtained from a Gaussian distribution with mean \(\lambda\) and \(L\) and with dispersion \(\Delta\lambda\) and \(\Delta L\) respectively.

Figure 13 shows the number of rejected preforms as a function of the cut number (1 to 6) as listed above. The study is presented for 6, 9 and 18 sorted fibres. The overall effect of the acceptance windows is a rejection of 3-4% of preforms quite independent of the number of fibres under test. In statistical jargon this are errors of type II. The power of the test is \(p=1-0.035=95\%\). As expected, as the number of fibres increases, the cuts on the average parameter of the preforms become less effective but the effect of cuts on individual fibres increases.

As a check we apply the acceptance criteria to 9 or 6 fibres randomly extracted from the preforms 1-11 of the first batch: we find that preforms n. 8 still fails the requirements 3,4,5,6 in case of 9 fibres and it also fails requirements 4 and 6 in case of 6 fibres sorted. For all other preforms all acceptance requirements are satisfied even reducing to 9 or 6 the number of fibres under test (see table 1).

## 7 Conclusions

We have built and put into operation a system for QC of 18 WLS fibres at once. This procedure provides a precision of:

* \(\Delta L/L\)=1.5% for the light yield;
* \(\Delta\lambda/\lambda\)=3% for the attenuation length.

We applied this system to the first batch of fibres received from Kuraray and we found that its quality is within the acceptance windows with the exception of fibres from preform n. 8 whose optical quality is clearly poorer than that of the other ones.

Based on the characteristics of the 10 good preforms we propose an acceptance scheme for the forthcoming batches of fibres which is able to provide good QC while reducing the probability of preform rejection due to statistical fluctuations to a few percent.
