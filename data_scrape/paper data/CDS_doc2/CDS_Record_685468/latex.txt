###### Abstract

This note presents a full simulation study of the expected ability of the Tile calorimeter to identify low \(p_{T}\) muons, either isolated or inside b-jets, using the information from its last compartment in depth and from the respective trigger towers. Two methods to tag muons in the Tilecal are compared. The performance is evaluated as a function of the expected rejection for u-quark jets in the three main regions of the Tilecal (barrel, extended barrel and \(\Pi\)C) and as a function of the \(p_{T}\) of the jets.

This calorimeter is able to trigger muons with \(p_{T}\) above about 2 GeV, and the efficiency depends strongly on the electronic noise and on the direction in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) of the incident muon.

The expected efficiency in the first level is of the order of 6 5% against an efficiency for light quark and gluon jets of the order of 8 %, for jet \(p_{T}\sim 40\) GeV. In the second level, it is of the order of 70 % against an expected efficiency for light quark and gluon jets of the order of 8 % for jet \(p_{T}\sim 40\) GeV. The worse performance expected in the first level is mainly due to the higher electronic noise in the analog signals available at that level.

Introduction

Muons with momentum above \(\sim\)4 GeV will be triggered and measured in the muon trigger chambers in the outer surface of the ATLAS detector after crossing more than 10 \(\lambda\) of calorimeter material.

A low p\({}_{T}\) muon loses energy mainly by ionization, behaving approximately like a mip, and, depositing in average about 2-3 GeV in the material in front the muon spectrometer. The energy deposited in the calorimeters will fluctuate from event to event due mainly to the radiative processes and can be larger than 3 GeV.

The possibility to trigger low p\({}_{T}\) muons using the information of the Tilecal allows to help in the suppression of the background in the muon trigger chambers and to lower the limit of the muon \(p_{T}\) that could be triggered in the ATLAS detector, which is also useful to tag b-jets in the subsequent trigger levels.

Two kind of Tilecal calorimeter signals will be available in the first level trigger. The first kind corresponds to the trigger tower signals summed in depth over a suitable number of channels, approximately two per calorimeter depth. The other set corresponds to the signals of the cells in the last Tilecal compartment in depth (D-cells). Figure 1 shows the Tilecal segmentation. The tower signals are obtained by summing up the analog signals from the correspondent channels, while the signals in the cells of the last Tile compartment are analog non-summed signals from each channel, as implemented in the 2002 test beam.

For the following trigger levels, the full digitized information of this calorimeter is available.

The \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) segmentation is 0.1\(\times\)0.1 for the first two depth compartments (A and BC/B cells) and 0.2\(\times\)0.1 for the D-cells, as shown in figure 1.

Each cell is readout by two PMTs (or channels). The Tile trigger tower segmentation is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\), being this segmentation achieved by adding up two signals in the corresponding cells of the two inner compartments with the signal of one of the PMTs that readout the corresponding D-cell in the outer compartment. The signal of the second PMT reading the D-cell is added to the next trigger tower, as described elsewhere [1]. A complete trigger tower is formed by the signals from 5 channels. There is one incomplete trigger tower containing a D-cell in the extended barrel region and none in the barrel.

In the following sections two methods to tag muons are presented and compared. The first method uses a threshold in the signal of the most energetic s3 cell (D-cell) and the second requires that this signal is within a range of energies.

The simulation presented in the following sections was done using Pythia [2] to generate the physics processes (jet events), Dice [3] and Atrecon [4] to simulate and reconstruct the generated and simulated events, respectively.

## 2 Few remarks on the ATLAS physics

The ATLAS experiment has a wide physics program, which includes the search for the Higgs Boson, B-physics studies, top physics studies, etc.

Many of the B-physics channels that will be studied in the ATLAS detector, like \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})K^{0}\), will require a muon trigger in the first level and an extra muon in the second level and event filter. The main source of background to trigger those channels in the muon trigger chambers comes from the cavern background [5] which can contribute to the muon trigger by accidental coincidence of hits of charged particles like muons, charged pions and kaons, etc.

Figure 2 shows the expected event rate in the muon trigger chambers. The

punch through of the jets is not an important source of background in this ATLAS subsystem.

To keep the first level trigger rate at an acceptable level it will be necessary to increase the minimum muon \(p_{T}\) that it is triggered to about 6 GeV, if the muon trigger chambers are used in a stand alone mode.

The trigger of channels like \(WH\to l\nu_{l}b\overline{b}\) or \(t\overline{t}\to l\overline{\nu}b\overline{b}jj\) will require a high \(p_{T}\) lepton trigger in the first level, and the tagging of the b-jets with momentum above \(\sim\)15 GeV in the second level [7].

In the first level the muons will be triggered in the muon trigger chambers.

In the second level, the signals of the inner detector are already available and can be used to tag b-jets.

The b-jet tagging in the ATLAS detector can be done by the calculation of the impact point (\(d_{0}\)) for the reconstructed vertexes, and, additionally, by searching for low \(p_{T}\) leptons inside the jet, being the total efficiency :

\[\epsilon_{b}^{tot}=\epsilon_{b}^{pert}+\epsilon_{b}^{\mu/e}-\epsilon_{b}^{pert} \epsilon_{b}^{\mu/e} \tag{1}\]

In this note it is shown that the Tilecal can be used to trigger low \(p_{T}\) muons either in the first or second levels and two methods [8, 9, 10, 11] to do it are

Figure 2: Differential cross section (\(d\sigma/dP_{T}\)) for inclusive muon production in ATLAS for \(|\eta|<\)2.7 [6].

compared from the point of view of their efficiencies to trigger the signal and reject the background (light quark and gluon jets).

## 3 The methods

The methods used to trigger muons in the calorimeter use the fact that muons are penetrating particles, behaving approximately like mips and losing energy mainly by ionization, deposited in a limited region of the calorimeter which spreads over one or two calorimeter cells in each depth. In this way, the muon trigger is done by searching for the most energetic cell in the last compartment in depth.

Two methods are presented and compared from the point of view of their efficiencies either to trigger muons or to reject jets without muons. The first method (here called **method 1**) tries to reject the jet events without muons and accept b-jet events with muons with an energy threshold in the signal of the most energetic Tilecal s3 cell.

The second method (here called **method 2**) requires that the energy of the most energetic s3 cell is compatible with the expected signal of a mip in that region of the calorimeter by imposing an energy threshold and a veto to the signal.

For each s3 cell giving a muon trigger, the respective most energetic trigger tower, between the two possibilities, is searched for and it is required a signal in this trigger tower compatible with the signal of a muon in the respective region.

## 4 Tile response to isolated muons

Tests carried out with prototype and final modules of the Tile calorimeter have shown that this subdetector is able to detect isolated muons. The deposition of energy by a low \(p_{T}\) muon follows approximately the behaviour of a Minimum Ionizing Particle (mip), which means that the spectrum of the energy deposited in each cell spreads over a limited interval of energies and the deposition of energy in each depth of the calorimeter is limited to one or two cells, since it is done mainly by ionization. The spectrum of a 100-180 GeV muon in the Tilecal follows approximately a Landau distribution with a high energy tail due to depositions by radiative processes. The signal per calorimeter cell depends on the depth of the cell and on the direction of entrance (\(\eta,\phi\)) of the muon and it peaks at about 0.35 GeV for cells in the first compartment in depth, it is higher (about 1.2 GeV) for cells of the second compartment, due to the thickness of these cells, and it peaks at about 0.6 GeV for cells in the last compartment, for a beam entering the barrel module at \(\eta\)=0.45, as it is shown in figure 4. It is also shown the signal in the tower, which peaks around 2.1 GeV. Test beam results from the August 2002 test beam period are compared with simulated data.

The conversion of pC to GeV was done by calibrating the modules with 20 GeV to 180 GeV electrons entering the modules at different angles and

incidence points. An average factor of 1.20 pC/GeV was found [12] for the 2001 and 200 2 test beam periods and it is used in the work presented in this note. In the 2002 test beam, the gain applied to the last compartment channels of D0, D1,...,D4 cells was increase by a factor of about 20%. This factor was corrected with off line intercalibration, but it was considered in the study presented in this note, in the determination of the electronic noise. Two electronic noises were considered: 0.19 pC/PMT and 0.07 pC/PMT, which correspond to \(\sim\)158 MeV/PMT and \(\sim\)58 MeV/PMT (or to \(\sim\)136 MeV/PMT and \(\sim\)50 MeV/PMT in the D0,...,D4 cells), respectively.

The equalization of the simulated data with the test beam data was done by the equalization of the peaks of both spectra for 180 GeV muons entering the detector at \(\eta=0.45\) in the center of a module, as shown in figure 4.

### Average energy lost versus muon energy

Muons with small p\({}_{T}\) (less than about 2 GeV) are completely absorbed in the inner layers of the ATLAS calorimetry, producing no signal in the last Tile compartment in depth. Muons with p\({}_{T}\) above about 2 GeV can leave a significant signal in the last Tilecal compartment, as can be seen in figure 4.

Figure 4: Signal produced in the most energetic cell of the Tile sampling 3 by a beam of muons entering the ATLAS detector at \(\eta\)=0.35 and \(\phi\)=0.049 (center of a module) as a function of the energy of the incident muon. Electronic noise of 0.19 pC rms per channel. (MC simulation).

The average signal produced in the last compartment in depth by muons with p\({}_{T}\) higher than about 2 GeV is approximately constant and equal to about 0.5 GeV for muons entering the detector at \(\eta\)=0.35. The slightly increase in the plateau of the curve as the energy of the muon increases (about 10% for muons with \(p_{T}\) between 2.5 GeV and 10 GeV), is mainly due to the increasing loss of energy by ionization and to the increasing probability of losses by radiative processes.

### Average energy lost versus \(\eta\)

Since the quantity of material in the Tilecal depends on \(\eta\) and \(\phi\), the average energy lost by muons in the Tile calorimeter will also depend on the impact point and direction of the incident muon, as it is shown in figure 5 for the last sampling. The maximum energy lost by muons in one cell of the Tilecal corresponds to an incident \(\eta\) value of about 1.2 where the quantity of material in the last Tilecal compartment (s3) is the largest. The minimum energy lost corresponds to an incident \(\eta\) value of about 0.8 in the gap between the barrel and the extended barrel modules. From both plots of figure 5 one can see that there is a good agreement between the energy lost in the most energetic s3 cell and the quantity of material traversed by the beam, see reference [13] for more details in the distribution of material in the ATLAS detector.

The large fluctuations in the energy lost by muons entering the ATLAS detector at \(\eta\) around 0 are due to the large fluctuations in the sampling fraction in this \(\eta\) region of the calorimeter as it is detailed in reference [13]. For \(\eta\) near 0 there is a high probability that a muon traverses mostly absorber or scintillator producing almost no signal or a large signal, respectively.

The top and the bottom plots of figure 5 show the signal in the last Tilecal sampling produced by muons with p\({}_{T}\) between 2.5 and 3 GeV and between 3 and 7 GeV, respectively. About 15% of the events in the top plot, and 13% of the events in the bottom plot (in the \(\eta\) range \(|\eta|<1.4\), produce a signal lower than 250 MeV (or 0.3 pC). These events correspond mainly to muons that traverse the Tile calorimeter in the central region (\(\eta\sim 0\)) or in the gap between the two Tilecal main cylinders or in the two regions \(|\eta|>1.4\). The geometrical acceptance of the last Tilecal compartment is \(|\eta|<1.4\), as shown in figure 5.

It was found that 98% of these events were triggered in a \(\Delta\eta\) window of \(\pm 0.2\) around the initial direction of the muon, as shown in figures 6 and 7 for events triggered in the Barrel, Extended Barrel and ITC. Muons triggered outside this window come mainly from events with muons generated at \(\eta\) values coincident with the gap between the barrel and the extended barrel (\([0.7,0.8]\)) or at low \(\eta\) values (\(\eta\)\(\sim\) 0).

Figure 7 reflects the \(\eta\)-segmentation of the calorimeter in the last sampling. The right plot shows events triggered in a \(\Delta\eta\) calorimeter window of \(\sim\pm 0.35\)

Figure 5: Response of the Tilecal to 2.5-7 GeV muons entering the ATLAS detector at different \(\eta\) values and \(\phi\)=0.049 (center of a Tile module), as a function of the muon \(\eta\) entrance. An electronic noise of 0.19 pC was considered. (MC simulation).

around the direction of the incident muon.

Most events are identified in a \(\Delta\eta=\pm 0.2\) calorimeter window around the initial direction of the muon, except the events triggered in the \(D\pm 6\) cells (cells at the largest values of \(|\eta|\)) which cover a \(\eta\) range larger than the normal \(\Delta\eta=0.2\) (see figure 1 for details in the geometry ).

The right plot in figure 7 shows events identified in s3 cells with \(\eta\) coordinates farther than 0.2 from the initial direction of the muon. As shown, most of these events were generated at \(\eta\) values coincident with the gap in the region of the ITC or at \(\eta\sim 0\). The regions \(|\eta|>1.4\) are not covered by the last Tilecal

compartment.

Most events generated at \(|\eta|<1.4\) and identified outside a \(|\Delta\eta|<0.2\) calorimeter window do not leave enough energy in the calorimeter to pass a threshold in the s3 cell, except by accident, due to the electronic noise. So, in general, these events are not triggered.

In the \(\phi\) direction 99.7% of the events (positive muons) were triggered in a window with dimension 0.2 at a distance 0.1 from the initial direction of the incident muon, as shown in figure 8. This shift is due to the magnetic field in the inner detector which bends the muon trajectory in the ATLAS detector.

## 5 Signal produced by b and u-jets

To evaluate the ability of the Tilecal to identify b-jets with muons and to reject other jets without muons, b and u-jets with several different momenta entering the detector at two different \(\eta\) values (\(\eta\)=0.45 and 1.15) were generated. For each b-jet, it was required the presence of at least one muon with transverse momentum between 2.5 GeV and 7 GeV. It was shown in previous works [8, 9, 10] that the signal produced by gluon and light quark jets is identical to the signal produced by u-jets, as well as the signal produced by b and c-quark jets without muons.

As mentioned before, the method used to identify muons with this calorimeter aims to use advantage from the fact that those particles can penetrate large amounts of material before being completely absorbed while most of the other particles (depending on their energies) are absorbed before, in the e.m.

calorimeter and/or in the first two layers of the hadronic Tile calorimeter.

The energy in the cells of the last Tilecal depth was investigated and the signal in the most energetic cell of this compartment is shown in figure 9, for both b-jets containing at least one muon and u-jets.

The search for the most energetic cell of the sampling 3 was not confined to a region of the calorimeter around the direction of the jet, but it was extended

Figure 9: Signal in the most energetic cell of the last Tilecal compartment in depth, produced by b-jets containing at least one muon with p\({}_{T}\) between 2.5 GeV and 7 GeV (left side) and u-jets (right side). Jets with \(p_{T}\) equal to 10 GeV (yellow plots), 100 GeV (red plots), 200 GeV (blue plots) and 300 GeV (blue plot in c)) were generated at \(\eta\)=0.45, \(\eta\)=1.15 and \(\phi\)=0.049. (Electronic noise of 0.19 pC/channel.)

to the whole calorimeter.

The electronic noise and photostatistic effects were included with Gaussian and Poisson smearings in the simulated data, as before. An average of 55 photoelectrons per  GeV of deposited energy and per cell was considered. Two different values of electronic noise (0.19 pC and 0.07 pC) were considered.

It was found that 62% of the events were identified in a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)=0.4\(\times\)0.7 window around the direction of the initial quark, for b-jets with \(p_{T}\)=20 GeV.

Table 1 summarizes the fraction of b-jets+\(\mu\) tagged in a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) calorimeter window around the direction of the incident parton, for calorimeter windows with different dimensions.

Figure 9 shows that the spectrum produced by b-jets with muons peaks around 500 MeV (or 0.6 pC) in the s3 cells of the barrel, and, around 1.5 GeV (or 1.8 pC) in the s3 cells of the extended barrel which approximately corresponds to the signal produced by single muons in these regions of the calorimeter. The spectra produced by u-jets have the peak at \(\sim 0\) which in the extended barrel increases with the increasing \(p_{T}\) of the jet. As the \(p_{T}\) of the jet increases the fraction of events in the high energy tails of the spectra increase for both jet flavours which have similar responses for high values of deposited energies.

The quantity of material in the last compartment of the extended barrel at \(\eta\)=1.15 is about 5.1 \(\lambda\), while the quantity of material in the last barrel compartment at \(\eta\)=0.6 is about 2.2 \(\lambda\). Since the quantity of material in the last Tile extended barrel sampling is quite large, the fraction of energy sampled in this compartment can be large, as far as the energy of the jet is not absorbed in the previous layers of the detector.

The efficiency to tag jets was calculated as the ratio between the total number of jets passing an energy threshold and the total number of generated jets (equation 2) and it is shown for some jet momenta and for \(\eta\)=0.45 and \(\eta\)=1.15, in figure 10.

\[\epsilon=\frac{\#\,of\,jets\,passing\,the\,threshold\,}{total\,\,\#\,of\, generated\,jets} \tag{2}\]

In the barrel region (\(\eta\)=0.45) for low \(p_{T}\) jets (\(p_{T}\)=20 GeV), the signals

produced by the two jet flavours are well separate: for an energy threshold equal to 300 MeV (or 0.36 pC) the number of b-jets\(+\mu\) with \(p_{T}\)=20GeV passing this threshold is about 80%, while the number of u-jets with \(p_{T}\)=20 GeV passing the cut is of the order of 15%, as shown in figure 10. As described before, as the \(p_{T}\) of the jet increases the punch through in the last Tilecal compartment increases and the separation between the two signals becomes worse.

As mentioned before, the signal produced by b-jets\(+\mu\) and u-jets in the extended barrel is in average larger (figure 9) since the thickness of the cells in the last compartment is larger and the quantity of material in front this compartment is the same or less than in the barrel. As shown in figure 10, for an energy threshold equal to 0.7 GeV the number of low \(p_{T}\) jets (\(p_{T}\)=20 GeV) passing the cut is of the order of 80% while the number of u-jets (\(p_{T}\)=20 GeV) passing the cut is of the order of 15%, approximately like in the barrel for this jet \(p_{T}\).

The "purity" (equation 3) 1 as a function of the energy threshold, shown in figure 11, was calculated as the ratio between the efficiency for the physics signal (b-jets\(+\mu\)) and the sum of the efficiencies for the physics signal and background (u-jets), for jets with \(p_{T}\)=10 GeV and \(p_{T}\)=100 GeV:

Footnote 1: Actually the purity should be calculated as the ratio \(\eta=\frac{\epsilon(signa)!}{\epsilon(signa)!+\frac{\sigma\left[{\it background }\right]}{\epsilon(signa)!}\left[{\it background}\right]_{\it\epsilon}(background)}\), where \(\sigma(background)\) and \(\sigma(signal)\) are the cross sections for production of background and signal events, respectively.

\[purity\,=\frac{\epsilon(b-j\,et\,s+\mu)}{\epsilon(b-j\,et\,s+\mu)+\epsilon(u- j\,et\,s)} \tag{3}\]

As shown previously, this figure confirms that, the separation between the signal (b-jets\(+\mu\)) and the background (u-jets) depends on the \(p_{T}\) of the incident parton and, in general, is better in the barrel than in the extended barrel. For 10 GeV jets, the maximum purity for events identified in the barrel is above 90% while for events identified in the extended barrel is of the order of 87%.

In the barrel the "purity" changes \(\sim\) 5% for an energy threshold between 300 MeV (or 0.36 pC) and 600 MeV (or 0.72 pC) and it is maximum at \(\sim\) 600 MeV. For this range of thresholds, the efficiency to detect the physics signal varies between about 80% and 40% for jets with \(p_{T}\)=20 GeV, while the fraction of accepted background changes less than 10% in this interval, for jets with \(p_{T}\) below 100 GeV.

In the Extended Barrel the "purity" changes less than 5% for an energy threshold between 0.7 GeV and 1.2 GeV. In this range of thresholds, the efficiency to detect the signal varies between about 65% at 0.7 GeV and \(\sim 55\%\) at 1.2 GeV, for jets with \(p_{T}\)=20 GeV, while the efficiency for the background (u-jets) changes less than 10%.

The energy threshold was chosen as a compromise between the best purity and a good efficiency to tag muons either in b-jets or isolated. As a first approximation an energy threshold of 0.3 GeV, for an electronic noise of 0.07 pC, (or 0.35 GeV for an electronic noise of 0.19 pC per channel ) was chosen for events

Figure 11: The purity as a function of the energy threshold for jets with transverse momentum equal to 10 GeV (top plots) and 100 GeV (bottom plots), entering the detector at \(\eta\)=0.45 (left plots) and \(\eta\)=1.15 (right plots). Electronic noise equal to 0.19 pC/channel.

tagged in the barrel and 0.7 GeV for events tagged in the extended barrel.

The veto was chosen in order to accept more than 95% of the signal for a \(p_{T}\) equal to 20 GeV. For the barrel (\(|\eta|<0.6\)) a veto of 1.2 GeV was chosen, and, for the extended barrel, it was chosen 2.4 GeV.

## 6 Efficiency as a function of the \(p_{T}\) of the jet

To study the performance of the last Tile sampling to distinguish between the signals produced by b-jets+\(\mu\) and the signals produced by u-jets as a function of the \(p_{T}\) of the jet, single b and u-jets with transverse momentum in the range from 10 to 500 GeV were generated uniformly at different incident \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) values. A \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) scan of the detector was done in the range -1.4\(\leq\eta\leq\)1.4 and \(0\leq\phi\leq 2\pi\). The events were generated uniformly in the whole \(\eta\) interval. As before, it was required the presence of at least one muon with \(p_{T}\) between 2.5 GeV and 7 GeV in the b-jets.

The most energetic cell of the sampling 3 was searched for and the efficiency to tag b-jets (\(\epsilon(b-jets+\mu)\)) and u-jets (\(\epsilon(u-jets)\)) is shown in figure 12 for an energy threshold of 0.35 MeV and a veto of 1.2 MeV for events tagged in the barrel and an energy threshold of 0.7 MeV and a veto of 2.4 MeV for events tagged in the extended barrel. The efficiencies are integrated in (\(\eta,\,\phi\)) and the search for the most energetic cell was not confined to a region of the calorimeter around the direction of the jet, but it was extended to the whole calorimeter, as before. The performance of the last Tile sampling to tag b-jets+\(\mu\) is shown for the two methods: the method 1 which uses only a threshold and the method 2 which uses a window of energy.

With the second method (window), as the \(p_{T}\) of the jet increases the fraction of accepted background also increases up to a maximum of \(\sim 30\%\) for a \(p_{T}\) of the order of 200  GeV. The efficiency to tag b-jets with \(p_{T}<150\) GeV is above \(\sim 60\%\) in the barrel and extended barrel.

With the first method (threshold) the fraction of accepted events increases systematically with the jet \(p_{T}\) for both jet flavours.

The ratio (R) between the fraction of the signal and background events accepted with both methods is shown in figure 13 for an electronic noise of 0.19 pC per channel, which shows that the second method improves slightly

Figure 12: Efficiency to tag b-jets + \(\mu\) (top row) and u-jets (bottom row) as a function of the \(p_{T}\) of the jet for the barrel (left plots) and extended barrel (right plots). The method 1, \(E_{cell}>0.35\)  GeV, is compared with the method 2 (0.35 GeV \(<E_{cell}<\)1.2 GeV), for an electronic noise of 0.19 pC per channel.

the separation between b-jets+\(\mu\) and u-jets due to a better rejection of the background. This improvement depends on the electronic noise.

The efficiency to tag b-jets+\(\mu\) and u-jets with the second method (window) and the respective ratio (R) is shown in figure 14 for an electronic noise of 0.07 pC (or \(\sim 50\) MeV)2 An energy threshold of 0.3 GeV was applied to events tagged in the barrel. The other cuts are the same of figure 12.

Footnote 2: As mentioned before, in the 2002 test beam period the gain applied to the last compartment channels was increase by a factor of 20 % in the D0, D1,...,D4 cells, which improved the signal to electronic noise ratio.

The ratio R=\(\epsilon(b-jets+\mu)/\epsilon(u-jets)\) depends on the \(p_{T}\) of the jet and, in the extended barrel, is strongly dependent on the direction of the parton. In

average, R is higher in the barrel.

## 7 Information in the Tilecal towers

Since muons lose energy mainly by ionization which is absorbed in a localized region of the calorimeter around the trajectory of the muon, and since the Tile towers are almost projective, at least in the barrel, the signal of a muon should be mostly contained in one trigger tower.

The \(\Delta\eta\) segmentation of the Tile calorimeter in the sampling 3 is 0.2 and

Figure 14: Efficiency to tag \(b-jets+\mu\) and u-jets with the second method, as a function of the \(p_{T}\) of the jet for an electronic noise of \(\sim\)0.07 pC rms. The \(\epsilon(b-jet\,s+\mu)/\epsilon(u-jets)\) ratio is shown on the bottom.

the segmentation of each trigger tower is 0.1, as mentioned before and shown in figure 1. So, to each Tilecal s3 cell corresponds two trigger towers, and, in general, the energy lost by muons will be mostly contained in one of them.

For each s3 trigger cell the most energetic tower, between the two towers containing one channel of the s3 cell, was searched for and its signal is plotted in figure 15 for jets with \(p_{T}<\)60 GeV tagged in the barrel, and in figures 16 and 17 for jets with \(p_{T}<\)60 GeV tagged in the extended barrel, for electronic noises of 0.19 pC and 0.07 pC. In the barrel, while the b-jets+\(\mu\) spectrum in the most energetic tower peaks around 2 GeV, as expected from a signal of a muon in a Tilecal barrel tower, the signal from u-jets peaks around zero. The low energy peak in the b-jet spectrum is mainly due to b-quarks generated at \(\eta\) values corresponding to the gap between the barrel and the extended barrel or generated at low \(\eta\) values (\(\eta\sim\)0).

In the extended barrel the overlap between the two signals is higher because the projectivity of the calorimeter towers in \(\eta\) is not as good as in the barrel and the muon signals are, in general, shared between more than one tower. The signal of b-jets+\(\mu\) peaks at a lower value than in the barrel. If the trigger towers were projective the tower signals would be expected to be higher in the

extended barrel where the global amount of material crossed is higher.

The extended barrel towers were numerated in increasing order of \(\eta\):

* Tower 1: C9+D4+D5(one channel)
* Tower 2: B10+D5(one channel)
* Tower 3: A12+B12+D6(one channel)
* Tower 4: A13+B13+D6(one channel)

This separation between the two signals allows to require a signal above a threshold in the most energetic trigger tower. This threshold was calculated for the different regions of the calorimeter as a compromise between extra reduction of the background and the maintenance of the efficiency for b-jets+\(\mu\) tagging. The choice of thresholds for the trigger towers should depend on the choice of thresholds for the last sampling trigger signals, in order to avoid that the threshold in the tower will reduce significantly the b-jet+\(\mu\) events tagged in the

last Tilecal layer.

The efficiency was calculated as a function of the \(p_{T}\) of the jet when the following cuts are applied:

* Barrel: \(0.3\mbox{GeV}<E_{cell}<1.2\mbox{GeV}\) and \(E_{tower}>0.5\mbox{GeV}\) for an electronic noise of 0.07 pC/channel or \(0.35\mbox{GeV}<E_{cell}<1.2\mbox{GeV}\) and \(E_{tower}>0.5\mbox{GeV}\) for an electronic noise of 0.19 pC/channel
* Extended Barrel: \(0.7\) GeV \(<E_{cell}<2.4\) GeV and \(E_{tower}>0.5\mbox{GeV}\) and it is shown in figures 18, 19 and 20 for two different electronic noises: 0.19 pC and 0.07 pC.

The expected efficiency for b-jets with muons is of the order of 70% over a wide range of momenta (\(p_{T}<150GeV\)) for an electronic noise of 0.07 pC per channel and of the order of 65% for an electronic noise of the order of 0.19 pC per channel, for events tagged in the barrel (\(|\eta|<0.6\)).

The threshold in the most energetic tower helps to eliminate the background from u-jets. For 100 GeV jets, the the threshold in the most energetic tower improves the rejection by about 20%, as can be seen from figures 12 and 18.

In the extended barrel the efficiency depends strongly on the direction of the jet and it is about 80% for jet events with \(p_{T}<100GeV\) triggered in D5

and D6 cells and towers 2, 3 4, and lower in the rest of this region, for an electronic noise of 0.07 pC per PMT. In average it is about 5 or 10% lower for an electronic noise of 0.19 pC per PMT, as shown in figures 19 and 20.

## 8 Efficiency to trigger isolated muons

The efficiency to trigger isolated low \(p_{T}\) muons with the thresholds and vetoes found to trigger muons inside jets was calculated as a function of the \(p_{T}\) and direction \(\eta\) of the incident muon, and it is shown in figures 21 and 22. No cuts were applied in the trigger towers. As it is shown in figure 21 the Tilecal is able to identify muons with \(p_{T}\) above approximately 2 GeV. The efficiency is

Figure 20: Efficiency to tag jets in the different regions of the extended barrel and ITC. Electronic noise of 0.19 pC per channel.

about 75% for muons with \(p_{T}\) above \(\sim\) 2.5 GeV entering at \(\eta\)=0.35, using the cuts chosen before (0.35 GeV \(<E_{cell}<\) 1.2GeV and \(E_{lower}>\) 0.6GeV, electronic noise of 0.19 pC per channel). It varies between about 60% and 85% in the barrel, depending on the initial direction of the muon being slightly lower for \(\eta\)'s around zero (about 55%), due to the high probability of the muon to cross mainly steel in this region, producing a smaller signal, as explained before.

The average efficiency varies between 60% and 90% in the extended barrel being lower for muons that cross approximately the middle of the D5 and D6 or in the outer border of these two cells. In the ITC the efficiency to tag isolated

low \(p_{T}\) muons is quite poor.

Almost all muon events (about 98%) were identified in a \(\Delta\eta=0.1\) region around the direction (\(\eta(\mu_{gen})\)) of the incident muon, as shown in figures 23 and 24. The few events outside this window correspond mainly to muons entering the detector at \(|\eta|\sim 0\) or in the region of the ITC or at \(|\eta|\sim 1.4\). Most of these events do not contribute to the trigger because the signal produced by them in the most energetic s3 cell is, in general, quite low to pass the threshold. In order to study the spatial resolution of the Tile calorimeter to muons, an additional tower was constructed in the extended barrel, composed by the channels: A14+B14+D6(one channel).

Figure 22: Efficiency to trigger isolated muons with \(p_{T}\) between 2.5 GeV and 3 GeV (top plot) and with \(p_{T}\) between 3 GeV and 7 GeV (bottom plot) as a function of the direction \(\eta\) of incident muon. (Electronic noise of 0.19 pC/channel).

Figure 24: Distance in \(\eta\) (\(\Delta\eta\)) between the direction of the incident muon and the trigger tower where the muon was confirmed, as a function of the direction of the generated muon.

As shown, the Tilecal is able to identify muons with \(p_{T}\) above about 2 GeV with a spatial resolution in \(\eta\) described by a Gaussian distribution with \(\sigma_{\eta}=0.04\). About 99% of the muons are identified in a calorimeter window with radius \(\Delta\eta=0.1\) centered in the most energetic trigger tower, where the muon is confirmed.

## 9 The electronic noise and response dependence on \(\phi\)

At the moment, the signals available in the first level trigger are analog non-summed signals from each one of the two PMT's reading out each D-cell which have a higher electronic noise than the digitized signals available in the second level trigger.

The expected electronic noise per channel in the LvL 1 Tilecal muon trigger signals is of the order of 0.19 pC (with the "integration method" 3) while in the LvL 2 it is of the order of 0.07 pC.

Footnote 3: The muon signals in the Tilecal have been obtained by the integration of the current over an interval of time of the order of 75 ns. With this method, the electronic noise is integrated as well over this interval of time, which makes it higher. A new method to obtain the signals for the first level is under study and is based on the search for the peak of the signal in a fixed interval of time. This is expected to reduce significantly the electronic noise.

If \(\sigma_{1}\) is the electronic noise of each individual channel, and \(S_{1}\) is the MOP of a muon signal in each individual channel, the electronic noise in the cell (\(\sigma_{c}\)) is of the order of \(\sigma_{c}\sim\sqrt{2}\sigma_{1}\), and the MOP of a muon signal in the cell is \(S_{c}\sim 2S_{1}\), for muons entering the detector in the middle of a module.

In this way, the \(S/\sigma\) ratio in the cell is about \(\sqrt{2}\) of the \(S/\sigma\) ratio in each individual channel (\(S_{c}/\sigma_{c}\sim\sqrt{2}\,S_{1}/\sigma_{1}\)).

Since the electronic noise in each one of the two channels that read out the same cell is essentially non-correlated, imposing a quite low threshold to both channels, the fraction of accepted electronic noise would be very reduced, to the level of a few percent.

However the response of the Tile calorimeter to muons depends on the angle \(\phi\) of entrance of the muon in the cell, and this dependence is stronger when the signals in the individual channels are analized instead of the signal in the cell (PMT 1+PMT 2), as shown in figure 25. This figure shows the signals in the individual channels of the D3 cell and in the sum of the two channels (signal in the cell), when beams of 180 GeV muons enter a barrel module at \(90^{0}\) in tile #10 with impact points at different distances from the readout fibers. The signals are shown as a function of the distance between the center of the beam and the center of the tile. The data was taken in the August 2002 test beam (\(\phi\) scan). The responses are normalized to the individual channels when the muon beam enters the module in the center of the cell, which should be the same for both PMTs as far the channels are intercalibrated and the test beam table is correctly aligned.

At 100 mm far from the center of the tile the average response in the farther

Figure 25: Fraction of signal collected in the two channels reading out the cell D3 and in the whole cell (sum of the two channels), for beams of 180 GeV muons entering the barrel module at \(90^{0}\). “\(\phi\) scan” performed in the August 2002 test beam.

PMT (channel) decreases about 25% with respect to the response of the channel when the beam enters in the center of the tile, and about 40% at 150 mm from the center of the tile.

In this way, the efficiency to trigger muons will depend on the muon entrance angle \(\phi\) in the calorimeter.

One possible way to make the efficiency to trigger muons less dependent on the impact point of the muon in \(\phi\), it is to apply the energy thresholds to the signals in the cells and not to the signals in the individual channels. Another possibility, it is to require to only one of the two channels reading out the same cell a signal above a threshold (\(E_{pmt1}>E_{thres}\) _or_ \(E_{pmt2}>E_{thres}\)) and not to both (\(E_{pmt1}>E_{thres}\) _and_ \(E_{pmt2}>E_{thres}\)).

## 10 First Level Muon Trigger

The first level muon trigger is steered by the pivot station or middle station, as shown in figure 26. Each time a strip in the pivot station is fired the trigger logic searches for fired strips in the other two stations, as described in detail in reference [14].

Figure 26: Scheme of the muon trigger chambers.

Two trigger logics are foreseen: one for low \(p_{T}\) muons and another for high \(p_{T}\) muons. The low \(p_{T}\) muon trigger requires a coincidence of the pivot station with the inner station while the high \(p_{T}\) trigger requires a coincidence with the other two stations.

Within this scheme, the Tilecal can act as a third layer to confirm the muon candidate in the low \(p_{T}\) trigger logic. After the confirmation of a coincidence of the fired strip in the pivot station with some suitable strips in the inner station, the search can be extended to the cells of the last compartment of the Tile calorimeter.

The search for the confirmation should be done by looking for a signal compatible with the signal of a muon (\(E_{Thres1}<E_{cell}<E_{veto}\)) in a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) calorimeter window around the expected trajectory of the candidate to muon. A \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.4\times 0.2\) calorimeter window should be wide enough.

For each calorimeter cell found with a signal satisfying the previous condition, the most energetic tower between the two containing the channels of the respective D-cell, should be found. This tower should have a signal above a threshold (\(E_{tower}>E_{Thres2}\)). This condition helps to eliminate the electronic noise.

The Tilecal is able to identify muons with \(p_{T}\) above about 2 GeV. Muons not absorbed before the end of the last Tile calorimeter will lose in average \(\sim 400\) MeV in the girder if they are able to cross the full width of this steel compact structure.

In this scheme it would be possible to trigger muons with \(p_{T}\) above about 3-4 GeV.

The use of the Tilecal as a third layer for the confirmation of a muon candidate would also improve the rejection of the cavern background in the muon trigger chambers. To quantify this improvement it is necessary a detailed study of this background.

## 11 Second Level muon Trigger

A Tilecal muon trigger can be used to help in the trigger of some B-physics channels requiring the trigger of a second muon in the LvL2. It can also be used to tag b-jets improving the efficiency for b-tagging.

For this last purpose (b-tagging), the search for the muon can start in the cells of the last compartment (D-cells) in a \(\,\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) calorimeter region, around the direction of the incident jet. This represents a search over 10 calorimeter cells.

The most energetic cell, in this calorimeter window, must have a signal compatible with the signal of a muon in that region of the calorimeter (\(E_{Thres}(c\,dl\,)<E_{cell}(c\,dl\,)<E_{veto}(cell)\)).

If this condition is satisfied there is a muon candidate in a region with width equal to \(\,\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\) centered in the middle of the D-cell in \(\eta\) and shifted in \(\phi\) by \(\pm 0.1\) (depending if it is a \(\,\mu^{\pm}\)).

The most energetic trigger tower, between the two containing one channel from the D-cell which gives the trigger of the muon candidate, should have a signal above a threshold (\(E_{lower}>E_{Thres2}\)).

If this condition is satisfied, the muon candidate is confirmed in a region \(\,\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.2\) with coordinates centered in the center of the most energetic Tile trigger tower in \(\eta\) and shifted by \(\pm 0.1\) in \(\phi\).

## 12 Summary

The Tilecal is able to trigger muons with \(p_{T}\) above about 2 GeV in the \(\eta\) range covering the interval \([-1.4,1.4]\).

The efficiency depends strongly on the cuts imposed in the cell of the last Tile compartment which gives the trigger of the muon. It depends also on the direction \((\eta,\,\phi)\) and on the impact point (z) of the incident muon in the Tile calorimeter and on the \(p_{T}\) of the jet. The trigger is worse at \(|\eta|\) values between \([0.7,0.9]\) in the region of the ITC where there is a gap for the passage of cables and services for the calorimetry.

Two methods to tag muons and to reject light quark and gluon jets using the last Tilecal sampling are compared from the point of view of their efficiencies: The method 1 uses a threshold in the energy of the most energetic s 3 cell and the method 2 requires a signal within an interval of energies.

The method 2 (window) shows to improve slightly the reduction of the fraction of accepted background over a wide range of jet \(p_{T}\). The threshold aims to eliminate the electronic noise and the signal produced by light quark and gluon jets which is, in average, lower. While the veto aims to eliminate events that deposit a large fraction of energy in the last Tilecal sampling which is, in average, mainly due to the punch through of the jets.

The threshold in the most energetic trigger tower helps to eliminate the background from u-jets. For 100 GeV jets, this threshold improves the rejection by about 20 %.

The spatial resolution (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\,\phi\)) of the Tile calorimeter to trigger muons (\(\mu^{+}\) or \(\mu^{-}\)) using its last compartment is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.2\) around the direction of the incident muon in \(\eta\) and shifted by \(\pm 0.1\) in \(\phi\) (in the positive or negative direction depending if it is a \(\mu^{+}\) or \(\mu^{-}\)). Muons (\(\mu^{+}\) or \(\mu^{-}\)) in b-jets with \(p_{T}<100\) GeV are identified with an efficiency of \(\sim 70\)%, in almost the whole \(|\eta|<1.4\) range against a rejection factor for u-jets of the order of 5 % for a \(p_{T}\sim 20\) GeV and for an electronic noise of 0.07 pC per channel.
