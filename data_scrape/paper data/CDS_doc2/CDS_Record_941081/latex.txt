###### Abstract

We describe a set of characterization measurements of scintillating fibres in view of their potential use in a tracking detector to determine absolute luminosity for ATLAS [1] at IP 1. The study concerns optical absorption length, reflectivity of Al-coatings of the fibre ends, minimum bending radius and geometrical fibre parameters.

## 1 Optical absorption length measurements

Fibre type: Kuraray SCSF-78, 0.5 mm\({}^{2}\), square, single cladded, S-type

Method 1: A fibre of 3 m length is laterally excited by UV light at 350 nm. The fluorescence light is detected at the fibre end by a Silicon photodiode as a function of the distance between excitation and detection point. The light at the opposite end of the fibre is lost except of a small fraction which undergoes Fresnel reflection (R \(\sim\) 5%) at the interface fibre/air. Light propagating in the fibre cladding is suppressed by an Aquadag coating of 3 cm length before the photodiode.

Results: The photocurrent of the photodiode varies exponentially with the distance. For distances up to 60 cm the data can be described by an absorption length of 120 cm. For larger distances (120 - 300 cm) the data is fitted by an absorption length of about 170 cm.

Method 2: For completeness we are including a measurement performed by our colleagues in Lisbon [2]: A fibre of 30 cm length is laterally excited by UV light at 375 nm. The fluorescence light is detected at the fibre end by a photomultiplier tube with bialkali photocathode as a function of the distance between excitation and detection point. The light at the opposite end of the fibre is lost except of a small fraction which undergoes Fresnel reflection (R \(\sim\) 5%) at the interface fibre/air. Light propagating in the fibre cladding is not explicitly suppressed. The influence of the cladding contribution needs to be quantified in a forthcoming test.

Results: The photocurrent of the measured with the PMT varies exponentially with the distance. The absorption length is about 70 cm.

Conclusions drawn from the two methods: As the absorption length is also wavelength dependent, the spectrum of the light detectable at the fibre end shifts with increasing fibre length to the red. The measured absorption length depends therefore on the sensitivity spectrum of the photomultiplier tube.

A second observation is that the absorption length appears to increase with the length of the fibres. To a certain extent this is also an indirect consequence of the wavelength dependence of the absorption coefficient. The absorption first removes primarily blue photons with a small \(\lambda_{\mathrm{abs}}\)(blue) value and then, when the spectrum is consequently shifted towards longer wavelength, red photons are absorbed with a larger \(\lambda_{\mathrm{abs}}\)(red) value.

There may however also be reflection related losses (e.g. absorption in the corners of the square fibres) which could lead to an apparent fibre length-dependent absorption length. Also the influence of the light transported over short distances in the cladding may lead to a shorter effective absorption length.

## 2 Reflectivity measurements of coated PMMA and fibre samples

The reflectivition properties of evaporated Aluminium films on various PMMA samples has been studied using the VUV spectrometer of the Thin Film & Glass lab (PH-DT2). The angle of incidence is 5\({}^{\circ}\).

PMMA samples: 1mm thick PMMA plates, 1 sample with the original surface polish, and two samples with diamond single point machining polish (with different speed parameters). All samples covered with a 100nm thick aluminium layer on machined side.

Aluminium coating:

Measurement on PMMA side Results:

-The original surface polished sample measured from Al side and through PMMA show reflectance values close to simulations (FilmStar \({}^{\mathrm{TM}}\) software).

On machined surfaces, the reflectance drop measured through PMMA (at PMMA-aluminium interface) is significantly higher than the one measured on the aluminium-air interface.

### Measurements on the 45/90\({}^{\circ}\) fibre test bundle:

The measurements were performed with Kuraray 3-HF and SCSF-78 fibres using a similar method as described in section 1.

Side reflectance on 45\({}^{\circ}\) cuts:

\begin{tabular}{l l} External Al & \\ mirror & \\ \end{tabular}

Side aluminium coating

3 configurations were measured:

1.) No mirror on end cuts: Two reflections on 45\({}^{\circ}\) ends (total reflectance angle for \(\sim\)30% of the incident light) + 1 reflection on Al side of fibre.
2.) With an external Al mirror to recuperate part of the light passing through the end cuts.
3.) With an aluminium coating on the end cuts (total reflectance is lost, \(\mathrm{R_{eff}\cong R_{Al}}^{3}\)) The effective reflectivity of the rear end cuts is calculated from photodiode current measurements, taking in account the absorption length of the fibers and assuming that the effective reflectivity of a 90\({}^{\circ}\) cut without mirror or coating is 5.2%The data is interpreted in terms of the transport efficiency _TE_, defined as the ratio of detected light divided by the produced light \(I_{0}\) (obtained from the measurement with a fibre without end coating). Assuming that the absorption length is known from the previous measurements the data allow to extract the reflectivity \(R\) of the reflective coating.

\[TE=\frac{1}{I_{0}}\,I_{\mathrm{det.}}=\frac{1}{I_{0}}\cdot\frac{I_{0}}{2}\left( e^{\frac{-L2}{\lambda}}+e^{\frac{-L1}{\lambda}}\cdot R\cdot e^{\frac{-L1+L2}{ \lambda}}\right)\]

Values taken for the calculation:

\begin{tabular}{l c c}  & Kuraray 3HF & Kuraray SCSF-78 \\  & fibres & fibres \\ \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{l c c} Absorption length \(\lambda\)[cm]: & 200 & 160 \\
11 [cm] & 15 & 15 \\
12 [cm] & 15 & 15 \\
1 n polystyrene & 1.59 & 1.59 \\ Air/polystyrene reflection & 0.052 & 0.052 \\ \end{tabular}

Results:

\begin{tabular}{l c c c}  & Kuraray 3HF & fibres & Kuraray SCSF-78 fibres \\  & Effective & Effective & \\  & Reflectivity at & Transport & Reflectivity & Transport \\  & end & efficiency & at end & efficiency \\ No mirror, 90\({}^{\circ}\) & 0.052 & 0.498 & 0.052 & 0.48 \\ No mirror, 45\({}^{\circ}\) & 0.335 & 0.620 & 0.56 & 0.68 \\ Ext. Aluminium mirror, 45\({}^{\circ}\) & 0.539 & 0.707 & 0.68 & 0.72 \\ Ext. Aluminium mirror, 90\({}^{\circ}\) & 0.657 & 0.759 & 0.69 & 0.72 \\ Aluminium coating, 45\({}^{\circ}\) & 0.304 & 0.607 & 0.51 & 0.66 \\ Aluminium coating, 90\({}^{\circ}\) & 0.640 & 0.751 & 0.76 & 0.76 \\ \end{tabular}

Conclusions:

- Fibres with 90\({}^{\circ}\) end cut: An evaporated Al coating increases the light yield by 0.76/0.48 = 1.58, i.e. 58% compared to an uncoated fibre.

- Fibres with 45\({}^{\circ}\) end cut: The uncoated fibre provides a slightly higher light yield than a coated fibre. The increase in light yield is 0.68/0.48 = 1.42, i.e. 42% compared to an uncoated fibre.

## 3 Bending tests of Kuraray and Bicron fibres

The measurements were performed with a set-up schematically shown below. It comprises a Xenon arc lamp, which is followed by a double monochromator to select a wavelength of 350 nm. The fiber under test is held in a small metal piece with a hole such that it can be excited by the light from the monochromator. The fluorescence light (~500-600 nm for a Kuraray 3-HF fibre) produced inside the fiber is read out by two identical (calibrated) photodiodes (Newport, type 818-UV). Diode 1 is mounted about 35 cm from the excitation point and serves as reference to cope with the intensity variations of the Xe lamp, which are normal particular after lamp start-up. Diode 2 measures the intensity after about 1.2m propagation through the fiber. The photocurrents were measured with a Keithley picoampere meter. The photocurrents were typically 1-5 nA. The fiber can be fed through a Teflon sleeve which wound around a cylinder. The diameter of the cylinder defines the bending radius of the fiber. The Teflon sleeve avoids any unnecessary mechanical stress which could occur from clamping the fiber. Most of the set-up is situated inside a light tight box. All tests were performed at ambient temperature.

Two PVC pieces with different diameters (15, 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 mm) which were used to define the bending radius of the fibers. The Teflon sleeve is fixed on the position with 60 mm diameter.

We have performed bending tests of Kuraray 3-HF 0.5 mm square scintillating fibers. The light transport performance of the bent fibers was measured over periods of up to 1 week.

Bending radii in the range 15 - 30 mm were investigated. The bending tests were performed at ambient temperature and no special techniques were applied.

* small section scintillating fibers require great care in manipulation in order to preserve a perfect surface quality.
* bending 0.5 mm square S-type fibers at a radius of 30 mm and below leads to a significant degradation of the light transport performance.
* the light transport suffers from cracks which are formed in the cladding layer and which possibly also extend into the fiber core.
* the fiber damage and the associated transport losses evolve in time. The initial loss rate increases with decreasing bending radius and reaches values in the 1% per minute range. On the time scale of one week we have not observed a full stabilization.

### Bending tests with scintillation light produced by a Sr-90 source

A comparative test was performed with 3 fibres in parallel: Kuraray SCSF-78, Bicron 612 and Bicron 612 MC, 0.5 mm\({}^{2}\), squared. The fibres were again coiled on the above described spool to a bending radius of 30 mm. The fibre ends were then exposed to electrons from a Sr-90 source. The scintillation light was detected by a Hamamatsu MAPMT H7568. The output signals of the MAPMT were recorded by a digital oscilloscope which measured both the pulse height and the integral under the waveform, i.e. the signal charge. Data was taken over a period of 9 days. In all 3 cases stability was found within the measurement precision.

## 4 Comparison of geometrical parameters of Kuraray and Bicron square fibres

We have performed a comparative analysis of the geometry of square scintillating fibers of 3 different types.

- Bicron BC612

- Bicron BC612MC

- Kuraray SCSF-78

All fibers are of square cross-section and have a nominal size of 500 \(\upmu\)m.

10 samples of about 1 cm length were prepared of each fiber. The samples were taken from the fiber at intervals of \(\sim\)10 cm. The samples were glued in PMMA blocks and polished. The blocks were then inspected under a microscope (x 100) and recorded by a CCD camera. The geometrical parameters (see below) were obtained by analyzing the calibrated images of the CCD camera.

Results

The Kuraray fiber has a better defined geometry than both Bicron fiber types:

- it's size is close to the nominal value

- it has a thinner inactive cladding

- the fiber shape deviates less from a square

- it has smaller cushion shape deformation

- it has smaller skewnessSkewness (difference of length of diagonal in \(\upmu\)m) and deviation from rectangular shape in mrad.
