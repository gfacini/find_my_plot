**Magnetic system description**

To estimate a behaviour of the ATLAS solenoid magnetic field inside hadronic tile calorimeter a set of 2-dimensional calculations is done using the CERN POISSON program package [1]. A model of the magnetic system is described as follow (see Figs. 1-5, for example):

* the solenoid coil has a length of 6.3 m, an inner radius of 1.23 m, and a thickness of 2 cm. A total current used for the whole coil length is 10.6 MAmpere-turnes, that gives magnetic flux density in a center of solenoid around 2 T;
* at 3 cm from the each edges of the barrel part. Thus,
there is 2 cm iron plate at each edge of the barrel part of hadronic calorimeter. At last the thickness of scintillator plate is 0.5 cm, and the thickness of iron between each two scintillator plates is 1.5 cm. As it is mentioned above, even rows of scintillator plates are shifted along the _z_-direction by 1 cm with respect to the odd rows.

A width of scintillator plates in the first three rows is 10 cm, this width in the next three rows is 13 cm, plate width in the following three rows is 16 cm, and this width in the last two rows is 17.5 cm;

there are two extended barrel parts of hadronic tile calorimeter beginning from the distances of 0.5 m from each edge of the barrel part. Its inner and outer radii are the same as for the barrel part. The length of each extended barrel part is 2.7 m, the inner structure is similar to the structure of the barrel part;

the last part of magnetic system consists of two iron support tubes of 12.3 m length. The first tube has an inner radius of 3.8 m and its outer radius varies from 3.85 to 4.1 m for different sets of the calculations. So, this tube has a thickness of 5 cm (set ATLAS_C_5), 10 cm (set ATLAS_C_10), 20 cm (set ATLAS_C_20), and 40 cm (set ATLAS_C_42). The second support tube has an inner radius of 4.1 m and a thickness of 10 cm. There is an air between these support tubes in the first three sets of the calculations.

## Results

The results of the calculations are shown in Figs. 1-20 and in Tables 1-4. For each set of the calculations the figures contain the general view of the magnetic system and four enlarged parts of the hadronic calorimeter presenting the behaviour of the magnetic flux lines in detail. The tables describe the values of magnetic flux density inside the scintillator plates at \(r\) =2.27, 2.54, 2.81, 3.08, 3.35, 3.62 m, and for the scintillator plates displaced at the centre of the barrel part (_z_ =0.75, 2.75 cm), at the edge of the barrel part (_z_ =2.9075, 2.9275 m), at the beginning of the extended barrel part (_z_ =3.4725, 3.4925 m), and at the end of the extended barrel part (_z_ =6.0925, 6.1125 m).

From these tables one can see that the typical values of the magnetic flux density inside the scintillator plates go-down in the central part of the barrel from 0.1-0.3 T for the 5-10 cm first support tube to 0.01-0.04 T for thicker tubes. One can see also, that these values for the other parts of calorimeter do not change much with the thickness of the first support tube and are around 0.1-0.6 T. Small deflections of the field lines from the smooth curves can be explained by the small number of the mesh nodes used for the calculations in the radial direction. This is caused by a huge number of the mesh nodes used in the \(z\)-direction and by the computer memory restrictions.

The figures clearly display that the general behaviour of the field lines in the centre of the barrel part depends from the thickness of the support tube.

## Conclusions

The presented results show that an essential part of the magnetic flux lines go through the central part of the hadronic calorimeter nearly parallel to the \(z\)-direction. An increase of the thickness of the support tube changes the behaviour of the field lines and decreases the value of the magnetic flux density in approximately an order. It means also, that for the choiced construction of the support beams, which have double-T shape, the magnetic flux density will vary with the azimuth in the central part of hadronic calorimeter.

To make more precise estimations of the magnetic flux behaviour inside the hadronic tile calorimeter, it is necessary to do 3-dimensional calculations of the magnetic system. That definitely will cause a lot of hard work for a person who will agree to do it.

Please  consider this note only like some kind of report on the present status of  my calculations, not more. Now I well understand the high value of magnetic  field inside the scintillator plates is a result of poor mesh I used for  these calculations. As I told you there are restrictions on the number of  nodes because of computer memory. So, to describe a hole magnetic- system I  used not only thicker scintillator plates, but only 6 nodes of mesh for  each plate: & in the corners, and two in the middles of radial sides. It's  not enough to get a right or close to right value for the field inside the  plate. Now I'll try to use 12 nodes for each scintillator plate, and I hope  that the field will be in 1-2 order of magnitude less.  But for the general behaviour of the field lines, I believe it's right.  In my absence here Boris Klochkov will describe the new geometry for  the calculations and we will continue our work. It is necessary to take  into account the stray field from the barrel muon toroid, it's possible in 2-D calculations too. But we can't take into account the stray fields from  the muon end cup toroid, again we need 3-D calculations for that. We have a  very simple program to calculate 3-D geometry for such magnetic systems  like the ATLAS air toroid's coils. But the time needs to make some  conjunction between this program and POISSON package. I will contact also  with the guys from Dubna you indicated me. So, the life is still continued.  I will keep in touch with you about all our successes.  Thank you very much for your care about me, maybe some time you will get a  success in this way. My greetings to Peter. ---  Cheers,  Slava.

From the table of B-H dependence I sent you before one can see that in my case the saturation of iron begins at about 1.3-1.4 T; - what is the field in the 2 cylinders. Do we saturate or not? The field is 1.75-1.4 T (barrel part) and 1.0-0.05 T (extended barrel part) in the first (5 cm thick) cylinder. The same is 1.6-1.1 T and 0.9-0.05 T in the second (10 cm thick) cylinder. So-the iron is saturated in the barrel part; - Is it different to have 1 cylinder or 2 cylinders with air in between. I conceder 2+5+air+10 cm and 2+40 cm as two extremal cases of field behaviour for using of double-T shape support beams. Of cause this is rough approximation, but I have no other way out. From the figures done in the previous answer and from the pictures which you will see I can suppose that the field in each support beam of double-T shape will have some spatial inhomogenety, that causes azimuthal ununiformity of field inside the iron of the tile calorimeter; - If I calculate the surface of continuos iron in the support structure, in the today design I have about 900-950 cm2 for each module (angle=360/64). I can immagine to increase that using the last 10 cm of the calorimeter to 1250 cm2. Doing more will be difficult! In all cases I calculated the part of magnetic flux goes through the inner part of calorimeter, not through the support structure only. So, if my future calculations will give an acceptable values for the field inside the scintillator plates, it will not necessary to increase the cross-section of the support beams. Let's wait and see;_ why in certain places you have (like at 227) a very large field? Because the field inside the scintillator plates is calculated using the values of magnetic potential on the closest nodes of the mesh used in the calculations. In my case this is the nodes on the boundaries between the iron and scintillator, and at r=2.25-2.27 the field is high (1.9-1.4 T). So I don't consider this large field at 2.27 m as a right one; - I do not see much difference between the results with 20+10 and 40. Is the difference important for you? Just visually, from the pictures. For all pictures I have drown 30 potential lines. And I repeat again that all obtained results are the first approximation only. It is a lot of work ahead. Kind regards, Slava.
