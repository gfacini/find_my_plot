Introduction

Radiation damage and radiation-induced background may affect all detectors in ATLAS. Front-end electronics must thus be carefully tested to track possible failures. The HV distributor system of the Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) does not depart from ATLAS rules and all tests to qualify the production components must be performed.

Particles causing Total Ionizing Dose (TID) such as photons will be numerous in ATLAS. Their interaction in oxides (such as SiO\({}_{2}\)) is the following[2]: electron-hole pairs are produced (the photon energy is about 1 MeV). A partial recombination can occur but an electric field induces a drift of the entities. Because of their high mobilities electrons will leave the oxide whereas holes are mostly trapped. The result is a net positive charged trapped in the oxide and a deterioration of the system response.

The main components of the High Voltage Distributor system of the TileCal, namely HVmicro and HVpto cards, were irradiated at Pagure (Saclay-France) on november 29, 2001 to evaluate the effect of TID on their behaviour. This note reports the doses applied, the results obtained and the conclusions infered.

## 2 Test procedure

Simulations [1][5] were recently performed for the whole ATLAS detector subdivided in elementary domains of 10x10 cm\({}^{2}\). At any location of the HV distributor system, the expected dose can be computed, taking safety factors into account (uncertainties from simulation, low dose rate and variation of radiation tolerance from lot to lot for electronic components) (figure 1). Explicit numbers are given in table 1 and one observes that the highest expected doses are 21.6 Gy and 30.5 Gy for HVmicro and HVpoto cards respectively. The doses applied during the tests were 45 Gy (62 Gy) for the HVmicro (HVpoto) card (uncertainty: 10%). These numbers were given by the simulations at the time of the tests. They are twice higher than the new expectations.

As requested in [1], ten cards of each type (HVmicro and HVpoto) were irradiated. These cards were extensively tested at Clermont according to a procedure followed for

\begin{table}

390\(\leq\)R\(\leq\)400 & Z\({}_{min}\)(cm) & Z\({}_{max}\)(cm) & Highest Dose (Gy) & Z\({}_{min}\)(cm) & Highest Dose (Gy) \\ \hline HVmicro & 202.1 & 218.6 & 21.63 & 528.4 & 544.9 & 10.08 \\ \hline HVpoto (external) & 147.3 & 201.7 & 24.64 & 473.6 & 528.0 & 26.88 \\ \hline HVpoto (internal) & 78.4 & 132.8 & 30.52 & 404.7 & 459.1 & 26.74 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

each production card: a functional test, one burn-in week (65\({}^{o}\)C), a functional test and calibrations (HVopto). More details on this subject can be found in [4].

The source was made of Co\({}^{60}\) (T\({}_{1/2}\sim\)5.2 years), a \(\beta^{-}\) nucleus giving photons of energies 1.173 and 1.332 MeV. The size of our cards (16.5x9.4 cm\({}^{2}\) for HVmicro and 54.4x9.4 cm\({}^{2}\) for HVopto) prevented us from testing ten sets at a time. Taking into account the activity of the source and the space available two runs were needed (each lasting two hours and seven minutes) to obtain the requested dose (precision: about 10%): for each run, a set of five HVmicro cards and five HVopto cards was irradiated. The locations of the cards (173 cm and 150 cm from the core for HVmicro and HVopto respectively) were computed to have an homogeneous beam for all the cards located on a given frame (see figure 2).

All the cards were under bias during irradiation (low voltages for HVmicro; low and high voltages for HVopto). The setup used is given on figure 3 and the card numbers in table 2. Radiation sensitive components are listed in table 3 and 4. Even if it was not mandatory in [1], we performed online measurements on two (one for each run) HVopto cards. Details are given in the next sections. Information concerning the cards (design, components,...) can be found in [3] and [4].

## 3 Results

### HVmicro cards

No HVmicro card was surveyed online during the tests but all the cards were tested afterwards (3 weeks after the tests) at Clermont. In particular, it was carefully checked that:

* the MicroController was working fine.
* the communication via RS232 and CANBUS was ok.
* there was no problems in reading/writing in the RAM and the EEPROM.

_After irradiation,the ten HVmicro cards passed all tests succesfully._

### HVpoto cards

#### 3.2.1 Online measurements

Even if it is not requested in [1], we performed online measurements on two HVpoto cards (namely numbers 150-039 and 150-044). The quantities recorded were the following (Labview based GUI):

Table 4: List of HVpoto components radiation sensitive. HV\({}_{in}\) is the common drawer HV (-830 V for extended barrel, -950 V for barrel see [3])* DAC counts, ADC counts (HVopto card) and high voltages (measured by a multi-meter) for the 24 HV channels.
* HV\({}_{in}\) for each side (odd and even) of the card (HV supply and ADC of the HVopto card).
* Temperatures (one on the card and two AD590 probes).
* Two -5V (one for each set of three DACs) and a reference voltage (1.23 V) digitized by the ADC.
* Low voltages and high voltage currents (given by the supplies).

No effect was seen on the low voltages (-15 V and +5V) and high voltage currents (stability better than 2% over the runs). A small decrease of the +15 V current was seen, even though not dramatic (roughly 0.15% of an equivalent ATLAS year). Bigger effects were observed on:

* the ADC: a reference voltage of 1.23 V (component: AD589JR) located on the HVopto card can be read by the ADC and is not \(\gamma\)-sensitive (see tests in [3]). The ADC digitization of this reference voltage as a function of ATLAS time is given on figure 4 for card number 150-039 (similar results were obtained for card number 150-044). A regular decrease of about 0.04% per ATLAS year is observed. A 0.5% loss is reached between 12 and 13 ATLAS years. After measurement of the reference voltage with a multimeter, one concludes that this decrease is due (at least partly) to the ADC (internal reference voltage). This is confirmed by looking at HV\({}_{in}\) values (given by the HV supply and the ADC) and has of course impact on the digitised HV values by the ADC: as seen on figure 5, a 1.5 to 2 % decrease is observed after twenty years. One can nonetheless correct for this taking into account the reference voltage: the variation is then less than 1% for most of the channel considered after twenty years of ATLAS operations. The fact that the HV decrease is bigger than the reference voltage one (and that we can not recover by using the reference voltage) may be due to other component such as the multiplexer.
* the regulation loops: we could have an estimation (at the 0.1 V level) of the oupt values of the regulation during irradiation thanks to a multimeter. This gave us a direct view on the behaviour of the regulation loops themselves. The results obtained (figure 6) are interesting: whereas all ADC values were decreasing, one observes that the "real" high voltage can increase or decrease. Most of the channels considered are within 0.5% of their initial value after ten equivalent years of ATLAS operations (only one channel was found with a 0.6% decrease after twenty years on card 150-039).

We must add that we encountered some problems with the on/off system [3] during irradiation: for some reasons the odd side of the cards went off but could be recovered.

The results obtained here can be compared to observations of previous tests[3] and one concludes that they are compatible: the ADC losses were of about 2.4% after 200 Gy and we have here 0.8% after 62 Gy (for the reference voltage).

regulation loop outputs (read by a multimeter) and the ADC conversions are given on figure 8. The mean values are close to zero (as expected if the calibration is ok) and RMSes are of about 0.06 to 0.08 V.

If one compares these results with the same obtained before irradiation (figure 9), one concludes that the calibration of the irradiated cards fully recovered the drifts triggered by the photon beam.

Another comparison that can be done concerns the calibration constants. In the procedure defined in [3], a quadratic fit of the pairs (ADC output, multimeter output) is performed. The resulting parameters are given in table 5, before and after irradiation. One can observe that the parameters obtained (before and after irradiation) are compatible, except parameter 1 which corresponds to the slope of HV output as a function of ADC counts. The difference is on average precisely 1.2% that is the same difference as the one found during post irradiation measurements. This simply means that TID affect only the slope of the ADC via its internal reference voltage. No additionnal non-linearities are created.

## Conclusions

Ten HVmicro and ten HVopto cards were irradiated at total doses equal to 45 Gy and 62 Gy respectively (uncertainty: 10%). According to simulations, these doses are the _highest_ expected in the HV distributor system area in ATLAS for twenty years of operations, taking into account all possible safety factors. _No component was killed during irradiation_. Post irradiation measurements at Clermont showed that no effect was observable on HVmicro cards. For what concerns HVopto cards, a drift on ADC results was seen (1 to 2 %). It could be partially corrected with the use of a reference voltage insensitive to radiations. Regulation loops did not show big losses: a decrease of less than 0.5% of the output voltages was observed after ten equivalent years of ATLAS operations. All the drifts encountered could be recovered after a new calibration of the HVopto cards.
