## 1 Introduction

One of the main opportunities of an upgrade of the LHC to deliver high luminosity, the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), is to enable precise measurements of the Higgs boson properties. In the Standard Model (SM), all properties of the Higgs boson are defined once its mass is known. However, this model has many open questions such as the hierarchy problem and the nature of dark matter. Many alternative theories addressing these issues make different predictions for the properties of one or more Higgs bosons. Precise measurements in the Higgs sector are therefore a high priority in the future programme of particle physics.

A comprehensive study of the projected precision of measurements of the Higgs boson production cross section times branching ratios and Higgs boson couplings was published by the ATLAS Collaboration in 2014 [1]. It was based on the extrapolation of the Run 1 results to the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity expected at HL-LHC. Figure 1 displays the expected precision at that time for the end of Run 3 (300 fb\({}^{-1}\) ) and HL-LHC. The published Run 1 [2] and Run 2 [3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9] results are also included as reference to demonstrate that current Run 2 results, based on 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) dataset, are close to expected precisions with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and that Run 2 extrapolations to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) will provide much better precision than previously expected. As consequence, the limitation induced by the current knowledge of systematic uncertainties will occur at a lower integrated luminosity than expected previously, if their magnitude is not reduced.

The aim of this note is to list the most critical theory uncertainties on the Higgs production mechanism and to evaluate their impact on cross section and signal strength measurements with \(\mathcal{L}\) = 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). Only a subset of production modes of the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) process and of decay modes for the \(t\bar{t}H\) channel are discussed in this note. These preliminary results will be presented in the June 18 HL/HE-LHC workshop to motivate the interest in improving theoretical estimates for the Higgs boson production, in view of the HL/HE-LHC CERN Yellow Report.

The results shown in this note use the statistical framework of the published Run 2 analysis with 36 fb\({}^{-1}\). The Run 2 extrapolation to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) accounts for the increase of cross-sections from 13 to 14 TeV and the increase of integrated luminosity. With respect to the previous Run 1 extrapolations [1], the Run 2 extrapolations benefit from the analysis improvements implemented in the Run 2 measurements.

To simplify the extrapolation, object reconstruction efficiencies and resolutions are assumed to be similar in the Run 2 and HL-LHC environments. This is based on the assumption that ATLAS upgraded detectors at HL-LHC will compensate the degradation from the higher pile up environment. All the systematic uncertainties, experimental and theoretical ones, considered in these extrapolations, are the same as those used in the Run 2 analysis.

Impact of theory signal uncertainty in the \(t\bar{t}H\) multi-leptons and \(t\bar{t}H,H\to\gamma\gamma\) channels

In this section the impact of the theory signal uncertainties is addressed for the \(t\bar{t}H\) multi-lepton (ML) and \(t\bar{t}H,H\to\gamma\gamma\) channels.

The \(t\bar{t}H\) ML channel targets Higgs boson decays to \(WW^{*}\), \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) with hadronically and leptonically decaying \(\tau-\)leptons, and \(ZZ^{*}\) without \(ZZ^{*}\to 4l\). Its extrapolation is based on the Run 2 analysis done with 36 fb\({}^{-1}\)[10]. The signal yields have been scaled according to the Higgs production cross sectionsvalues at 13 and 14 TeV, reported in Ref. [11]. The background yields have been scaled according to the parton luminosity ratio between 13 and 14 TeV, reported in Ref. [12], taking into account whether the background process is quark or gluon initiated

Figure 2 presents the ranking of signal strength uncertainties with \(\mathcal{L}\) = 3000 \(\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). The most important theory uncertainty arises from theoretical predictions in the assumed SM cross section which include uncertainties due to missing higher-order in QCD predictions and uncertainties on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) and the strong coupling \(\alpha_{S}\). This is the main component of the '\(t\bar{t}H\) model (inclusive)' label in Figure 3, that displays the breakdown of uncertainties on the signal strength for the \(t\bar{t}H\) ML channel as a function of the integrated luminosity. This uncertainty affects only the signal strength and

The full area corresponds to the statistical error while the dashed indicates the increase from theoretical uncertainties. The vertical blue/red lines correspond to the published Run 1/Run 2 (36 \(\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) ) precisions. The precisions are the publicly available ones and correspond to the expected/observed ones for Run 1/2. The Run 1 and Run 2 limits for \(Z\gamma\) and \(\mu\mu\) final states are outside the limits of the plots.

not the cross-section measurement accuracy itself. The main source of signal theory uncertainty for the cross-section measurement is the parton shower modelling \(t\bar{t}H\) which is evaluated from the comparison of alternative simulated samples, as done for the Run2 measurement [10]. It is the main component of the '\(t\bar{t}H\) model (acceptance)' label in Figure 3 which shows that it becomes dominant over the statistical precision for \(\mathcal{L}\) = 1000 \(\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). Figure 2 also shows that systematic uncertainties related to background modeling (\(t\bar{t}Z\)) and experimental uncertainties (\(\tau\) identification efficiency, jet energy scale) are highly correlated with the background model uncertainty. The uncertainty in the cross-section measurement is \(\sim\) 10%.

ranked. The experimental uncertainties are expected to be reduced with the full HL-LHC dataset.

A similar exercise, but without the signal and background cross-section scaling from 13 to 14 TeV, is done for the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel based on Ref. [3]. Figure 4 displays the ranking of all systematic uncertainties. Figure 5 shows the breakdown of uncertainties on the signal strength as a function of the integrated luminosity. The ranking and conclusions on the signal theory uncertainty are similar to the \(t\bar{t}H\) ML channel except that the \(t\bar{t}H\) model (parton shower), which affects both the cross-section and the signal strength measurement accuracies, matches the statistical precision only for the full HL-LHC dataset. Figure 4 also shows that the luminosity and analysis method uncertainties (these latter ones are related to the spurious signal determination), have similar magnitude as the signal theory one.

## 3 Impact of theory signal uncertainty in the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) channel

In this section, the impact of the theory signal uncertainties in the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) channel for the \(ggF\), \(VBF\) and \(VH\) production modes is addressed. The \(t\bar{t}H\) production mode is not considered here. The expected results are extrapolated from the Run 2 analysis based on 36 \(\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)[4]. For the following results, the Stage 0 - Simplified Template Cross Sections framework (STXS 0) has been used.

The ranking of uncertainties on the signal strength from the various signal theory uncertainties is shown for the three production modes. Only the values for \(\mathcal{L}\) = 36 \(\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) are presented but it was checked that their amplitudes will not be significantly reduced for \(\mathcal{L}\) = 3000 \(\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\).

A statistical precision of around 2%, 9% and 17% is expected with \(\mathcal{L}\) = 3000 \(\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) respectively for the signal strengths in the \(ggF\), \(VBF\) and \(VH\) production modes. For these processes the impact of the experimental systematic uncertainties is smaller than that of the signal theory uncertainties, which dominate the signal strength measurement precision. It should be pointed out that, for the \(ggF\) cross-section measurement, the luminosity uncertainty, assumed to be of the order of 3%, is the largest source of systematic uncertainty. For the \(VBF\) and \(VH\) production modes instead, also the cross-section accuracy is dominated by signal theory uncertainties.

For the \(ggF\) production mode, the signal theory uncertainty with the largest contribution comes from the QCD scale uncertainty for \(ggF\) events as shown in Figure 6. The second largest source of signal theory uncertainty is related to the PDF uncertainties. They are estimated with the eigenvector variations of the PDF4LHC_NLO_30 Hessian PDF set. These two uncertainties affect mostly the signal normalization and therefore have a negligible impact on the \(ggF\) cross section measurement accuracy. The main sources of signal theory uncertainty affecting the cross section are the tuning of the underlying event and the parton shower uncertainty for ggF events and have a similar impact as the luminosity uncertainty. They are estimated with AZNLO tune eigenvector variations and by comparing the acceptance using the parton showering algorithm from Pythia 8 with Herwig 7, as in Ref. [4].

The ranking of the signal theory uncertainties for the \(VBF\) signal strength is shown in Figure 7. The largest contribution comes from QCD scale uncertainty from \(ggF\) events with migration from the 0\(\rightarrow\)1-jet category. This migration is realized when \(ggF\) events with extra-jets from QCD radiation enter as background in the \(VBF\) categories, where two or more jets are required.

To estimate the migration effects on the \(n-\)jet \(ggF\) cross sections, the approach described in Ref. [11] is used, as in Ref. [4]. This uncertainty affects both the signal strength and the cross section measurement precision. The second largest impact is due to the uncertainties associated to modeling of parton shower and underlying event, which are primarily uncertainties on the acceptance, and affect therefore both the signal strength and the cross section measurement accuracy.

As shown by Figure 8, the QCD scale uncertainties for \(ggF\) events with migration from 1\(\rightarrow\)2-jet and 0\(\rightarrow\)1-jet categories are the two largest sources of theory uncertainty for the \(VH\) production mode. They affect both precisions of the signal strength and of the cross section measurements.

The black points, which refer to the lower \(x\) axis, show the fitted values and uncertainties of the nuisance parameters, relative to their prefit values, \(\theta_{0}\), and uncertainties, \(\Delta\theta\). The black lines show the postfit uncertainties of the nuisance parameters, relative to their nominal uncertainties, which are indicated by the dashed line.

## 4 Conclusion

A study on the impact of theory uncertainties related to the Higgs boson production mechanism in the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) multi-leptons and \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) channels at HL-LHC has been performed using extrapolations from Run 2 analyses based on 36 \(\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\).

For the signal strengths of the \(t\bar{t}H,H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) multi-leptons channels, the uncertainty on the assumed SM cross section is the largest source of systematic uncertainty. The second largest source is given by the uncertainty on modeling of the \(t\bar{t}H\) acceptance which affects the accuracy of cross section measurement as well.

In the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) decay channel for the \(ggF\) production mode, the two largest theory uncertainties for the signal strength are the QCD scale uncertainty and the PDF uncertainties. These uncertainties do not affect the cross section measurement precision which is limited by the luminosity uncertainty, the tuning of the underlying \(ggF\) event and the parton shower uncertainties. For the \(VBF\) production mode, the two largest theory contributions come from the QCD scale uncertainty from \(ggF\) events with migration from the 0\(\to\) 1-jet category and from uncertainties on modeling of parton showers and underlying event. For the \(VH\) production mode, the QCD scale uncertainties for \(ggF\) events with migration from 1\(\to\)2-jet and 0\(\to\)1-jet categories are the major sources of theory systematic uncertainty. For both the \(VBF\) and \(VH\) production modes, these uncertainty contributions affect both the signal strengths and the cross section measurement accuracies.
