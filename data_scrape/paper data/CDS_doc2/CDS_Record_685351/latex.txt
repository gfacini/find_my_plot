###### Abstract

The Tile Calorimeter contributes to the first level trigger with the fast analog signal coming from the trigger summing boards, so-called analog adder. The adders provide two kinds of output: the total energy sum in a trigger tower and the signal from the respective cell of the last radial calorimeter layer, which can be used for identifying muons, thus making the muon first level trigger more robust.

This note reviews the adder specifications and laboratory tests, whereas the main focus is put on the data analysis from the testbeam periods in 2001. Several improvements achieved by tuning the read-out are described. Using the testbeam results, the ability to identify muons in the last radial Tilecal layer is discussed. The experimental results obtained at the testbeams are completed with the Monte Carlo simulations.

## 1 Introduction

The Tile Calorimeter (Tilecal) is a hadronic sampling calorimeter of the ATLAS detector, being developed to perform the measurements at the LHC. The calorimeter makes use of steel as absorber and scintillating tiles as active material, which are readout by wavelength shifting fibres [1]. The light signals are converted into electrical signals by means of photomultiplier tubes (PMT) that readout specific groups of fibres, allowing radial and longitudinal cell segmentations.

The detector is composed of one barrel and two extended barrels, where the barrel covers rapidities \(|\eta|<1.0\) and the extended barrels cover the region \(0.8<|\eta|<1.7\). Radially, the detector is segmented into three layers and azimuthally, both the barrel and extended barrels are divided into 64 modules. The detector layout with the pseudo-projective cell definition is shown in the Fig. 1 (only one half of the barrel and one extended barrel is displayed).

Tilecal provides two kinds of analog signal to the first level trigger (LVL-1) system:

* Trigger tower sum with the granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\). Together with the tower sums from electromagnetic calorimeter it enables to perform the on-line event selection based on the transverse energy threshold for single or multiple jets and/or missing transverse energy [2].
* The signal from the third Tilecal radial layer (D-cells in Fig. 1). Shall be used by the muon trigger, to reduce the rate of fake triggers [3] due to low-energy particles background.

The Tilecal trigger towers are built by combining linearly five signals from the three sampling layers: two from the first1, two from the second and one from the last layer. Some towers, near the gap between the barrel and the extended barrel, require the sum of six signals. This task is performed by analog adders (adder boards) located inside the Tilecal electronic drawer. These boards also make available the third layer signal for the muon trigger system.

Footnote 1: Note that one cell is seen by two photomultipliers, which read-out the signal from the respective side of the Tilecal module wedge.

This note is organized as follows: next Section is devoted to the more detailed description of the adder board and the main results of the laboratory tests are presented. Then we report the results coming from the data taken during several testbeam periods in 2001, showing the effect of several improvements achieved. With the best settings, the performance of the third layer signal (muon output) is reported. The presented results are completed by the MC studies.

Although the main focus is on the muon output signal, the comparison with the digitized data is also shown. The trigger tower response to muons is discussed as well.

## 2 The Analog Adder Board

The circuit design should comply with input and output signals specifications.

The input signals are furnished by the 3-in-1 cards, they are differential, should be matched with 50 \(\Omega\) load, unipolar with 50 ns FWHM and 1.25 mV/pC calibration. As signals from different depths of the calorimeter are to be combined, the timing of different signals within 1.5 ns is required [4].

The adder output is readout directly by the level one trigger system and the level 1 requires a differential output signal able to drive 50 \(\Omega\) loads, 10 mV/pC calibration, maximum voltage swing of 4.0 V (400 pC), 10-bit dynamic range (noise smaller than 2 mV rms (0.2 pC)), linearity better than 2 %, fast overload recovery for 800 pC and the gain dispersion for all production should be smaller than 3 %. The signal from the third sampling layer should be available at one

specific adder output for the muon trigger. Both kinds of output (the trigger tower sum and the muon output channel) are amplified (voltage gain of 8).

### Circuit Description

The adder circuit is functionally composed by three stages: the input buffers, the signal addition and the output buffer.

The input buffers match the cable impedance and prevent inter-channels crosstalk. They are implemented by transconductance amplifiers (MAX435 from MAXIM [5]), which provide an output current proportional to the input voltage.

The signal addition is implemented by gathering all channel currents together to an electrical node and the total current is then transformed into voltage by a resistive load.

The output buffer is implemented as an instrumentation amplifier (OPA4650 from Burr-Brown [6]), in order to drive differentially the LVL-1 signal cable.

The third layer signal is provided by the independent input (MAX435) and output buffers (OPA4650), with the same calibration as the sum output.

The block diagram of the LVL-1 Tilecal adder is displayed in Fig. 2. One can identify each of the above mentioned stages.

### Laboratory Test Results

The main goal of this test was to obtain the circuit performance using a test setup as close as possible to the real experiment, therefore we used some parts of the Tilecal electronics front-end. The Tilecal mother-board and five 3-in-1 cards were used to perform this test. The results can be summarized as follows:

* Power consumption: 2.4 Watts.

Figure 2: _Block diagram of the LVL-1 Tilecal analog adder board._

* Linearity better than \(0.6\,\%\).
* Voltage swing \(\sim 4.0\) V.
* Gain \(\sim 8\) for both outputs.
* **Calibration 10 mV/pC**.
* Recovery time from saturation (800 pC): 24.2 ns.
* Signal speed on the level of the 3-in-1 card.
* Noise level at the sum output:
* \(0.9\pm 0.3\) mV rms (without the 3-in-1 card connected)
* \(1.9\pm 0.2\) mV rms (one 3-in-1 card connected)
* \(4.7\pm 0.3\) mV rms (five 3-in-1 cards connected).
* **Noise level at the muon output:*
* \(0.6\pm 0.3\) mV rms (without the 3-in-1 card connected)
* \(1.7\pm 0.3\) mV rms (with the 3-in-1 card connected).

The 3-in-1 card and the adder output signals are shown in Fig. 3. Note that there is no signal distortion caused by the analog adder, one can also identify the gain factor of 8.

## 3 Testbeam Performance

During the summer and autumn 2001, five Tilecal modules have been calibrated with the SPS beams. At the same time, the adder readout settings were investigated with the goal to achieve the best possible separation of the muon signal from the noise.

Figure 3: _The 3-in-1 card output signal (left) and the adder output obtained with this signal as input (right). Spectra are measured with the digital oscilloscope, when the charge of 200 pC was injected._

The adder signal was transmitted from the Tilecal electronic drawer to the control room by a special trigger cable (see below) and then processed in the following way:

* Read-out by a special prototype receiver.
* The amplitude was decreased by adjustable attenuators so that the trigger tower sum signal range (up to 400 pC) matches the dynamic range of the ADC. The attenuation of 12.1 dB was set.
* The signal was digitized by a 12-bit charge ADC unit. The ADC gate was set to 175 ns, which is large enough to contain the whole signal peak coming from the shaper (a part of the 3-in-1 card).

The trigger cable consisted of multiconductor twisted pairs (31 twisted pairs inside without the shielding) with 120 \(\Omega\) impedance between conductors at 50 MHz, the conductor cross-section being 28 AWG. The measurements of CIS (charge injection system) signal and noise performed with the digital storage oscilloscope revealed that the cable attenuated the signal amplitude by 35 %, whereas the noise only by 25 % (in terms of voltage rms). It means that the signal-to-noise ratio was reduced by 15 % with respect to that on the adder board output. This is a consequence of the cable attenuation and signal reflection on the receiver input impedance of 100 \(\Omega\).

### The Muon Signal Versus Noise

Using this setup, the response to high energy muons (150 and 180 GeV) was investigated. The spectra (sum of two adder muon outputs from the same cell) are shown in Fig. 4 as an example.

Figure 4: _The spectra of the adder muon outputs (sum of two adders seeing the same cell). Muons entered the calorimeter at \(\eta=0.25\) (left plot) and \(\eta=-1.05\) (right plot\({}^{\,2}\)). The hatched peaks correspond to the respective noise._

The signal in barrel is smaller than that in extended barrel due to different length of the muon path: the radial segmentation is different in barrel and extended barrel (the third barrel sampling consists only of scintillator rows 10 and 11, whereas in extended barrel it is represented by rows 8 - 11) and the higher impact angle in extended barrel3 also causes the muon track is longer.

Footnote 3: Here the signal/noise separation is worse than usual because of a problem in one adder muon output.

Footnote 3: Muons entering the calorimeter at projective \(\eta\) are considered.

The separation of the signal from the noise is based on thresholds applied to the signal/noise spectra. The fraction of the muon signal above a threshold (muon signal efficiency) versus the accepted fraction of the noise is shown in Fig. 5. The demonstrated separation of the signal from the noise is quite poor especially in barrel module (due to the short muon path).

A better signal/noise separation can be achieved when taking into account the whole trigger tower response for an isolated muon. As an example, let us consider the muon entering the calorimeter at \(\eta=0.25\) (see Fig. 6): the left plot shows the respective spectra, the muon signal efficiency as a function of the noise fraction accepted is shown in the right plot.

Figure 5: _The muon signal efficiency (fraction of signal above the applied threshold) versus the accepted fraction of noise with the original readout settings. Note that the efficiency was obtained for the sum of two adder muon outputs seeing the same cell. The difference between the barrel (\(\eta=0.25\)) and extended barrel (\(\eta=1.05\)) is due to the different muon path length (see text)._

#### 3.1.1 The Influence of Attenuators

Since the range of the adder muon output is small compared to that of the towers, the attenuators are not needed for the muon outputs. Moreover, they may introduce additional thermal noise. Therefore, the signal/noise separation should be better without the attenuators.

In order to compare the signal/noise separation in various read-out settings, the signal-to-noise ratio \(S/N\) (most probable value4 of the signal over the noise sigma) is an appropriate quantity.

Footnote 4: The most probable value (MOP) is obtained from the Landau-Gauss convolution fit to the muon signal spectrum [7].

When comparing the same channel with and without the attenuator, the signal-to-noise ratio appears to be systematically better when attenuators were removed. This feature is illustrated in Fig. 7 for a single adder muon output (\(\eta=1.05\)). Whereas the spectra with attenuator (left plot) exhibit \(S/N=2.5\pm 0.1\), the right plot (attenuator removed) shows \(S/N=3.5\pm 0.3\).

#### 3.1.2 The Gate Tuning

Since the adder muon output will be used only for separation of the muon signal from the background, the full pulse integration is not needed. One can decrease the ADC gate so that the ADC integrates less noise (in the narrow peak's vicinity only). Although some part of the signal is lost in such a case, the signal-to-noise ratio improves.

The response to muons entering the extended barrel at \(\eta=-1.05\) was investigated with several ADC gate settings. Attenuators were removed. The resulting signal-to-noise ratio (relative to the original value obtained with 175 ns gate) is shown in Fig. 8. The ratio improves with the decreasing gate. The range of measurement was limited by the ADC (min. gate of the ADC used is around 50 ns).

Figure 6: _The noise and muon response spectra from the calorimeter tower (left plot). Isolated muons entered the calorimeter at \(\eta=0.25\). The right figure shows the derived efficiency versus the fraction of accepted noise._Figure 8: _The signal-to-noise ratio for the 180 GeV muons at \(\eta=-1.05\) as a function of the ADC gate. Two single adder muon outputs are displayed. The ratio is normalized to its original value corresponding to the gate of 175 ns._

Figure 7: _The analog adder muon output spectra (one channel) obtained with 180 GeV muons at \(\eta=1.05\) together with the respective noise (hatched peaks). The spectra are drawn in ADC units to clearly show the difference. The signal-to-noise ratio is better without the attenuators (see text)._

#### 3.1.3 The Influence of the PMT-Gain

The PMT-gain does not influence the noise level coming from the adder output, whereas it is proportional to the signal. Therefore, the increase of the PMT-gain also improves the signal-to-noise ratio.

This dependence was also investigated with muons entering the extended barrel at \(\eta=-1.05\), the ADC gate was kept at 65 ns (corresponds to the best performance achieved). The gain of one PMT was changed in several steps by adjusting the respective high voltage (HV). The gain of the second PMT was kept constant for reference.

The results are displayed in Fig. 9, both the HV and the signal-to-noise ratio are given relative to the original settings. The ratio improves with the increasing HV of the PMT as expected.

The improvements of the adder muon output signal-to-noise ratio are summarized in Tab. 1 for the extended barrel module \(|\eta|=1.05\) as an example. Taking into account the best achieved performance, the muon signal efficiency versus the fraction of noise accepted is shown in Fig. 10. The results for the extended barrel directly come from the measurements. The barrel module curves (\(\eta=0.2\)) are derived from the extended barrel ones

Figure 9: _The signal-to-noise ratio for a single adder muon output as a function of the photomultiplier HV (relative to the original HV, so-called equalized HV, denoted \(V_{\text{EQ}}\)). Measured with 180 GeV muons at \(\eta=-1.05\). The ratio is also shown relatively to its original value at equalized HV. Since the noise is HV independent, the \(S/N\) ratio scales with HV in the same way as the gain \(G=\alpha V^{\beta}\) (the fitted function)._muon signal scaling. Thus, the results in barrel region represent the estimated performance.

Also shown in the Fig. 10 is the effect of increasing the PMT gain (from the original "equalized" high voltage \(V_{\rm EQ}\)): whereas no significant effect would appear in the extended barrel, the improved performance in the barrel region would enable to achieve the muon signal efficiency of 87 % with only 10 % fraction of the noise accepted.

Further improvements are still possible, e.g. to reduce the noise in the readout system. If subtracting the noise coming from the trigger cable and receiver, the efficiency curve for barrel module \(\eta=0.2\) (equalized HV) moves up to 85 % efficiency at 10 % of accepted noise (to be compared to 80 % efficiency - see Fig. 10).

Finally, let us compare the analog LVL-1 muon signal with the standard digitizer one5: the respective spectra (\(|\eta|=1.05\)) are shown in Fig. 11 as an example. Even with the best achieved adder readout settings, the adder muon output signal is broader than the digitized signal because of the larger noise in the analog adder6: whereas the adder noise sigma amounts to 0.27 pC (sum of two adder muon outputs from one cell), the corresponding digitizer noise sigma amounts to 0.07 pC only.

Footnote 5: The signal from every Tilecal photomultiplier is digitized by the front-end electronics. The digitized signal enters the high level trigger and is stored for offline processing (if the event is accepted by the trigger), only the LVL-1 trigger deals with the analog signal.

Footnote 6: The input signal of the analog adder comes from the low-gain signal of the 3-in-1 card while the digitizer makes use of the high-gain output for energies below 16 pC. The low-gain signal has a poor signal-to-noise ratio which causes the high noise level on the adder output.

### The Analog Signal Pulse Height

Using the results of the testbeam measurements, one can estimate the pulse height of the analog signal coming from the adder muon output. Taking into account the adder calibration (10 mV/pC - see Section 2.2) and the muon response obtained with digitizers, the pulse height of the MOP muon signal at \(\eta=0.25\) amounts to 2.5 mV. This amplitude comes from the adder output, nevertheless the signal is then attenuated in the trigger cable (see Section 3). Therefore, the resulting amplitude is:

\[U\approx 1.8\ {\rm mV}\ {\rm at}\ \eta=0.25 \tag{1}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Readout settings & \(S/N(|\eta|=1.05)\) & Improvement factor \\ \hline initial & 2.5 & \\ attenuator removed & 3.5 & 1.4 \\ tuning ADC gate (65 ns) & 4.9 & 1.4 \\ increase PMT gain (by 20 \%) & 5.7 & 1.15 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _The improvements of the signal-to-noise ratio in the single adder muon output measured in the extended barrel at \(|\eta|=1.05\)._Such amplitude is too small to be treated by standard discriminators, therefore a hardware improvement is being implemented on the adder boards. The first laboratory tests indicate that the muon output calibration increases to \(\sim 300\) mV/pC and also the \(S/N\) ratio improves by \(\sim 30\%\).

Moreover, it is foreseen to increase the HV in the 3rd sampling so that the gain of the D-cells increases by a factor of 1.25. Thus, the resulting pulse height would correspond to7

Footnote 7: The signal attenuation in the cable of 30 % is considered. Although the trigger cables in ATLAS will be 70 m long (to be compared to 40 m cable used in the testbeam), the attenuation should not increase due to the better quality cables.

\[0.25\ {\rm pC}\times 300\ {\rm mV/pC}\times 1.25\times 0.7=66\ {\rm mV}\ {\rm at}\ \eta=0.25 \tag{2}\]

The first improved adder boards have been tested with the charge injection system. These laboratory tests indicate that using a simple threshold discriminator the muon signal efficiency of 90 % (while keeping 10 % fraction of accepted noise) can be achieved even for lower signal amplitude 0.17 pC. This efficiencies apply to single muon output, therefore a combination of two adder muon outputs (seeing the same cell) should provide even better signal/noise separation.

The improved adder boards are expected to be tested in the beam line in summer 2002.

Figure 10: _The muon signal separation from the noise in the sum of two adder muon outputs, taking into account all improvements achieved during the 2001 testbeam periods. The plot displays the muon signal efficiency as a function of the noise fraction accepted. The full symbols correspond to the original “equalized” HV applied to the PMTs. The open squares show the improved performance in the barrel region (\(\eta=0.2\)), when increasing the PMT gain by 20 %._

### The Coherent Noise

The level of the coherent noise has been investigated in the muon output channels for the best configuration (ADC gate 65 ns, no attenuators present, but keeping the original PMT gain 1.15 pC/GeV, which corresponds to the "equalized" HV). Denoting the Gaussian widths of the noise in channels 1,2 as \(\sigma_{1}\) and \(\sigma_{2}\) respectively, the coherent part of the noise \(\sigma_{\rm coh}\) in the sum should obey the relations

\[\sigma^{2}(1+2) =\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}+\sigma_{\rm coh}^{2} \tag{3}\] \[\sigma^{2}(1-2) =\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}-\sigma_{\rm coh}^{2} \tag{4}\]

The coherent part of the noise found in the data is at the level of \(\sigma_{\rm coh}=0.08\) pC (using the scale from the adder versus digitizer relation at the respective ADC gate), i.e. roughly 70 MeV, which represents 32 % of the total noise \(\sigma(1+2)\). The main part of coherent noise comes from the receiver and/or ADC (\(\sigma\approx 0.07\) pC, measured when the adder boards were disconnected), not from the adder.

Figure 11: _The muon response in the third Tilecal sampling at \(|\eta|=1.05\) as seen with the analog adder muon outputs (solid line) and the standard digitizer signal (dashed line). Two photomultipliers seeing the same cell are summed. The analog signal is broader because it is smeared by a large noise (shown with fitted Gaussian), which is almost 4 times larger than the corresponding noise in digitized signal (see text for more details)._

### The Adder Crosstalk

The crosstalk from a tower sum to a muon output channel would deteriorate the ability to identify muons in the outermost calorimeter sampling. Therefore the effect of the tower sum signal on the adder muon output was investigated for two different cases:

1. The crosstalk from a tower to a muon output in one adder: non-projective 20 GeV electrons entering the extended barrel were used for this purpose. No crosstalk effect has been observed in the muon output channel.
2. The crosstalk from a tower to a different muon output was investigated with 180 GeV electrons entering the extended barrel in the high \(|\eta|\) region. The crosstalk seen in the muon output channels was well below 0.1 %.

These investigations were completed with the tower-to-tower crosstalks studies using the 50 GeV and 180 GeV electron beams impinging the extended barrel module at 90 deg (samplings \(1,2\)). These beams deposited the whole energy in one tower only, the signal in other towers was used for evaluating the crosstalk. The analyzed data were collected with the original conditions (gate 175 ns, attenuators always present in the hadronic output channels). We found the typical crosstalk level of 0.2 %, the worst one seen just in one channel amounted to 0.4 %.

## 4 Geometrical Acceptance

So far we dealt only with muons entering the calorimeter at distinct eta values, crossing just one cell in the third Tilecal sampling. Since the cell segmentation is not perfectly projective (see Fig. 1) and moreover there is a 600 mm gap between the barrel and extended barrel part (needed for the inner detector and electromagnetic calorimeter services), the muon signal seen in one cell exhibits a large variability with the \(\eta\) coordinate.

This dependence has been studied using the standard Monte Carlo (MC) simulation packages (Dice, Atrecon8). The simulated muon response profile together with the known electronics noise (obtained from the testbeam measurements) allow us to evaluate the muon signal efficiency over the full Tilecal \(\eta\) coverage. Samples of 180 GeV and 8 GeV muons were generated in the full \(\eta\) range of the Tile calorimeter.

Footnote 8: Study done with SRT/CVS version 1.3.3 on the ATLAS Linux machines.

Fig. 12 shows the energy deposition by 180 GeV muons (8 GeV sample gives the same results) in the D-cells as a function of the pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\). If a muon crosses 2 D-cells, both signals are considered (two entries in the mentioned plot). Muons give a sort of radiography of the cell structure with a more less flat region in the barrel, and the triangular shaped edges in the extended barrel. Starting from \(\eta=0\) one can identify the D-cell edges (compare with Fig. 1) at \(\eta=0.1\), \(\eta=0.3\), \(\eta=0.5\) and \(\eta=0.7\) respectively, the gap region, the peak due to ITC (D-4) and the bigger cells D-5, D-6 in extended barrel (they give highersignal due to their larger radial thickness - see Section 3). At small eta (less than 0.1), the muon response exhibits a large spread due to large variations in the sampling fraction (iron/scintillator).

To account for the electronics noise, Monte Carlo data were smeared by a Gaussian distribution. The sigma of the smearing was chosen according to the respective noise seen in the testbeam data. The obtained MC spectra correspond then very well to those found in the testbeam both for the digitized and analog (LVL-1) signals. This fact is illustrated in Fig. 13 for muons entering the calorimeter at \(\eta=1.05\).

After the Gaussian smearing (according to that found in the best read-out configuration) applied, we have a realistic MC data sample, which can be used to estimate the efficiency of identifying a muon over the \(\eta\) range covered by the Tile calorimeter. Keeping the 10 % fraction of noise accepted (noise event reduction by a factor of 10), we have estimated the behaviour of muon signal efficiency. The results are shown in Fig. 14 (efficiencies for the 2.3 % fraction of noise accepted can be found in [8]). We have to notice:

1. The experimental points (see Fig. 10) obtained with the same fraction of accepted noise are in a good agreement with the MC simulation results - both the directly measured at \(\eta=1.05\) (almost 100 % efficiency) and the derived one for \(\eta=0.2\) (80 % efficiency).

Figure 12: _Energy deposited in the cells of the third Tilecal sampling by 180 GeV muons as a function of \(\eta\) (small point). The profile (average energy deposition) is superimposed to drive the eyes (full circles)._

2. The muon signal efficiency clearly shows the same behaviour as the energy deposition (muon path length) with important losses of efficiency at the cell edges due to muons splitted in nearby cells. For this reason, a muon tag based on a simple logic such the D-cells energy discrimination threshold is probably not the best strategy; a more complex approach (for instance, summation of nearby cells, before discrimination, etc.) should be studied.

## 5 Conclusions

The specifications of Tile calorimeter trigger summing boards (analog adders) are shortly reviewed and the summary from the laboratory measurements is given. The results are within the required specifications.

The note concentrates on the analog adder performance measured during the Tilecal testbeams in summer and autumn 2001. Especially, the signal from the adder muon output has been carefully studied, since it could be used to reduce the fake trigger rate in the LVL-1 RPC system.

Several improvements have been achieved in terms of signal/noise separation in these channels. With the best settings, the \(86\,\%\) efficiency of the muon signal can be achieved with only \(10\,\%\) fraction of the noise even at low pseudorapidities (\(\eta=0.2\)). Further improvements are still possible (reducing the noise in the read-out chain), the hardware changes in conjunction with the direct analog signal treatment (without integrating by ADC) look very promising (see Section 3.2). In the higher \(|\eta|\) region, the situation is even better mainly due to the different radial segmentation of the calorimeter layers.

The crosstalk between two trigger tower signals has been measured with

Figure 13: _Comparison of the Monte Carlo simulation data and the measured signals in the D-5 cell for muons at \(\eta=1.05\): digitizer signal (left plot) and LVL-1 analog signal (right plot). The same Gaussian smearing as seen in the testbeam data has been applied to the MC data._

high energy electron beams, its level amounts to \(0.2\,\%\) only. The crosstalk from a tower to the muon output channel has been investigated as well. It is well below \(0.1\,\%\).

The coherent noise in the adder muon outputs has been investigated as well. With the best settings, it amounts to \(0.08\) pC (\(32\,\%\) of the total noise), its main part comes from the receiver and/or ADC.

The studies are completed with the full ATLAS Monte Carlo simulations using the realistic noise. The muon signal efficiency (fraction of signal above the applied threshold) is shown over the full Tilecal pseudorapidity range. Using the very simple tagging logic and keeping the fixed noise level, the efficiency varies as a function of \(\eta\). The MC results are in a good agreement with the experimental ones.

Figure 14: _The muon signal efficiency in the sum of two adder muon outputs seeing the same cell as a function of \(\eta\). The fraction of accepted noise is kept constant on the level of \(10\%\). The efficiency variations follow the cell boundaries. The higher values in cells D-5, D-6 (extended barrel region) are due to the longer muon paths there (see Section 3)._
