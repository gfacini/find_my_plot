Motivation

The plots presented in this note compare the response of the ATLAS detector to electromagnetic processes in data at 8 TeV, and in simulated samples using different Geant 4 versions and physics lists. \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events and isolated direct photon candidates are used. We present three series of plots:

* Comparison of electromagnetic shower shapes as described in simulation by two different GEANT4 versions (Section 4.1);
* Comparison of the \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) lineshape in \(pp\) data at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 8 TeV and in simulated samples using two different GEANT4 versions (Section 4.2);
* Comparison of the relative fraction of converted photons in \(pp\) data at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 8 TeV and in simulation using two different GEANT4 conversion models (Section 4.3).

A brief description of the Monte Carlo (MC) samples used in the plots is provided in Section 2, while Section 3 gives a brief overview of the selection in of electrons and photons in data.

## 2 Simulation samples and setups

A detailed description of the ATLAS event generation and simulation infrastructure is provided in Ref. [1].

For this study, \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) Monte Carlo (MC) samples are obtained using POWHEG[2] interfaced to PYTHIA 8[3] with AU2CT10 tuning [4]. When appropriate, these simulated events go through the same selections as the data, as described in Section 3, and are corrected for a number of known discrepancies between data and simulation, e.g. the different distributions of average number of interactions per bunch crossing in data and MC; slight discrepancies in the electron trigger, identification and reconstruction efficiencies; the distributions of the primary vertex \(z\) position; the line-shape of the \(Z\) boson, to emulate a running \(Z\) boson width from the fixed width used in POWHEG.

Direct photon MC samples are obtained using PYTHIA 8 with AU2CT10 tuning. As for the \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) samples, these simulated events also go through the same selections as the data, and are moreover corrected for a number of known discrepancies, namely the different distributions of average number of interactions per bunch crossing in data and MC, the distributions of the primary vertex \(z\) position, and the distribution of the shower shapes in the LAr Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMC) used to define the quality of the photon candidates.

The ATLAS detector response is simulated using the GEANT4 program [5]. In order to study the impact of different detector simulation setups, \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) and direct photon MC samples are produced using alternative GEANT4 versions, and using different physics lists:

* \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\)**samples*
* GEANT4 v. 9.4, including a fix for the electron multiple scattering bug affecting Urban93 models [6];
* GEANT4 v. 9.6, using Urban95 models [6]. Both samples have been simulated either without pileup overlay, in order to allow for a more sensitive comparison between GEANT4 versions (Section 4.1), or with full pileup overlay, and are used to compare the detector response to electrons in data (Section 4.2).
* **Direct photon samples*
* GEANT4 v. 9.4, using Conv93 photon conversion model [7];
* GEANT4 v. 9.4, using Conv95 photon conversion model [7]. Both samples have been simulated including the pileup overlay, in order to allow for a direct comparison of the detector response to photons with data (Section 4.3).

## 3 Data selections

This study uses \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 8 TeV collected by the ATLAS detector [8] in 2012. All events are requested to pass the standard ATLAS data quality requirements. Events where the ATLAS LAr EMC or the ATLAS Hadronic Calorimeter response is affected by transient problems are rejected.

### Electron candidate selections

When the comparison is restricted exclusively to \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) MC samples (Section 4.2), electrons and positrons from \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events are simply selected by requesting they have \(|\eta_{e}|<2.47\)1, and \(E_{\rm T}^{e}>20\) GeV.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

When instead data is compared to MC (Section 4.2), \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) candidates are initially selected from events satisfying a trigger requirement with either one electron candidate with \(E_{\rm T}>24\) GeV passing the medium quality selection and being loosely isolated, or with one electron candidate with \(E_{\rm T}>60\) GeV passing the medium quality selection. This medium quality selection is based on rectangular cuts on tracking information and calorimetric shower shapes, following the procedure described in Ref. [9], with selections optimized for the pileup level expected in 2012 \(pp\) collisions. These events must then contain exactly two electron candidates in the detector central region (\(|\eta_{e}|<2.47\)), both satisfying the calorimetric quality requirements, passing the medium quality selection, and having a reconstructed transverse momentum, defined from the calibrated electromagnetic cluster energy and the polar angle measured in the ATLAS Inner Tracking Detector ID, above 27 GeV. Events are finally retained if the two electron candidates have opposite charges and an invariant mass in the range \(80<m_{ee}<100\) GeV. An additional selection on the \(z\) position of the reconstructed primary vertex, \(|z|<150\) mm is applied to improve the agreement between the the primary vertex \(z\) distribution in data and simulation. This selection retains about 6.25 million events in the \(pp\) data collected by ATLAS at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 8 TeV in 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 20.3 fb\({}^{-1}\). The same selections are applied to the correponding MC samples.

### Direct photon candidate selections

Direct photon candidates are initially selected in data from events satisfying at least one of several single-photon triggers, each requiring the presence of a photon candidate passing the loose selection, based on calorimetric shower shapes, and having transverse momentum larger then 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 GeV respectively. During the 2012 data-taking, no pre-scale was applied to the 120 GeV threshold trigger, and the collected total integrated luminosity amounts to about 20.3 fb\({}^{-1}\); increasing pre-scale factors were applied to the lower \(E_{\rm T}\) threshold single photons triggers, leading to smaller integrated luminosities. These events must then have at least one reconstructed primary vertex with at least two associated tracks. They must contain at least one photon candidate in the detector precision region (\(|\eta_{\gamma}|<1.37\), or \(1.56\leq|\eta_{\gamma}|<2.37\)), satisfying calorimetric quality requirements, passing the tight quality selection, and having a reconstructed transverse momentum \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\). The photon tight quality selection is based on rectangular cuts on calorimetric shower shapes, following the procedure described in Ref. [10], with selections optimized for the pileup level expected in 2012 \(pp\) collisions. The isolation energy \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}\) associated to each photon candidate must be smaller than 3 GeV. \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}\) is computed as the sum of the transverse energies of noise-suppressed clusters in a cone of radius \(R=\sqrt{(\eta-\eta^{\gamma})^{2}+(\phi-\phi^{\gamma})^{2}}=0.4\) centered around the photon direction, corrected by subtracting both the mean value of the small leakage of the photon energy outside its cluster, evaluated as a function of the photon transverse energy, and the estimated contributions from the underlying event and pileup. This correction is computed on an event-by-event basis using the method suggested in Ref. [11, 12] and first implemented in Ref. [13]. The same selections are applied to the correponding MC samples.

## 4 Response comparison

### Electromagnetic shower shapes

The response of the ATLAS LAr EMC to electron-induced electromagnetic showers in data and MC is evaluated by studying the behavior of different shower shapes, sensitive to the properties of the shower development in the detector. These shower shapes are computed as follows:

* **Variables using the second compartment of the EMC (Middle)*
* _Middle \(\eta\) energy ratio_ \[R_{\eta}=\frac{E_{3\times 7}^{S2}}{E_{\gamma\times 7}^{S2}}\] (1) is the ratio between the sum \(E_{3\times 7}^{S2}\) of the energies of the EMC Middle cells contained in a \(3\times 7\)\(\eta\times\phi\) rectangle (measured in cell units), and the sum \(E_{7\times 7}^{S2}\) of the cell energies in a \(7\times 7\) rectangle, both centered around the cluster seed.
* _Middle \(\phi\) energy ratio_ \[R_{\phi}=\frac{E_{3\times 3}^{S2}}{E_{3\times 7}^{S2}}\] (2) is defined similarly to \(R_{\eta}\).
* _Middle lateral width_ \[w_{\eta}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum E_{i}\eta_{i}^{2}}{\sum E_{i}}-\left(\frac{\sum E_{ i}\eta_{i}}{\sum E_{i}}\right)^{2}}\] (3) measures the shower lateral width in the EMC Middle, using all cells in a window \(\eta\times\phi=3\times 5\) measured in cell units.
* **Variables using the first compartment of the EMC (Front)*
* _Front lateral width (3 strips)_ \[w_{s\,3}=\sqrt{\frac{\sum E_{i}(i-i_{\mathrm{max}})^{2}}{\sum E_{i}}}\] (4)

### Fraction of reconstructed photon conversions

Photon candidates are reconstructed in ATLAS from energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter, possibly matched to tracks consistent with a photon conversion in the detector material. Candidate photon conversion vertices get reconstructed from tracks pre-selected as loosely matching electromagnetic energy deposits: they can consist of one or two tracks, where single-track vertices are constructed from tracks that are missing the hit in the innermost layer of the ID despite passing through a functioning detector module. If neither a track nor a vertex is matched to a cluster, the object is considered to be an unconverted photon.

The photon reconstruction procedure has an overall expected efficiency of about 98% for photons with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\), being on average \(>\)99% for unconverted photons, and about 95% for converted photons. The expected fraction of converted photons increases from about 20% at \(|\eta_{\gamma}|\sim 0\) to about 45% at \(|\eta_{\gamma}|\sim 1.6\), due to the increased amount of material in front of the EMC.

In data, photon candidates passing the tight shower-shape based selection, and satisfying the isolation requirement \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}<3\GeV\), are expected to have a purity above 80% at \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\sim 25\GeV\), and of better then 99% for \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}>200\GeV\) (see for instance Ref. [15]).

Figures 11, 12, 13 and 14 show the fraction of photon candidates reconstructed as converted photons over all selected photon candidates, in the pseudorapidity regions \(|\eta_{\gamma}|<0.6\), \(0.6\leq|\eta_{\gamma}|<1.37\), \(1.56\leq|\eta_{\gamma}|<1.81\) and \(1.81\leq|\eta_{\gamma}|<2.37\) respectively, for data and MC samples, as a function of the photon candidate energy \(E^{\gamma}\). The data are compared with the predictions from GEANT4 simulations using the Conv93 and Conv95 conversion models. For both data and MC, the uncertainties are statistical only. They do not account for any background contamination, nor for possible systematic uncertainties associated with the reconstruction of photon conversions. In general, a qualitatively better agreement between data and MC is observed when the Conv95 conversion model is used in simulation.
