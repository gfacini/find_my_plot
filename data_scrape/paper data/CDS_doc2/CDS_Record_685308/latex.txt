The \(W(\to\ell\nu)b\bar{b}\) production at LHC is an irreducible background for the possible observability of the Standard Model (SM) and Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) Higgs boson in the associated WH production with \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay. Here we present comparison of the background estimates as obtained with (a) complete massive matrix element for the \(q\bar{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) process; with PYTHIA implementation of the (b) \(q\bar{q}\to W\) process and (c) \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\) and \(gq\to Wq\) processes; followed by the parton shower. All of them: (a), (b) and (c) are leading to the production of the W-boson accompanied by the b-quarks in the final event but differ in the used approximation. We concentrated on the discussion of the predictive power of these approaches on the quantities relevant for the background estimates to the Higgs boson searches at LHC.

Introduction

The \(W(\to\ell\nu\,)b\overline{b}\) production at LHC has been recognized as the most substantial irreducible background for the Standard Model (SM) and Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) Higgs boson observability in the associated WH production followed by the \(H\,\to\,b\overline{b}\) decay.

The expected signal rates would be sufficient for the signal observability in the mass range around 120 GeV if the background could be efficiently suppressed [1]. For this channel both b-quarks are required to be tagged as b-jets and reconstruction of the peak in the invariant mass of the b-jet system concentrated around a mass window of \(\pm\) 20 GeV around the expected Higgs mass could lead to the evidence of the signal. The accompanying lepton is required to be identified to trigger an experiment. Relatively simple topology of the final state leaves not much room for severe optimisation of cuts. Just veto on an additional jet to suppress reducible backgrounds or angular correlations between reconstructed b-jets themselves or b-jets and lepton seem the only possibilities which can be explored.

The irreducible \(Wb\overline{b}\) background at the lowest level can be generated using complete matrix element for the \(q\overline{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu\,)g^{*}(\to b\overline{b})\) process. This has been implemented in [2] with the interface to PYTHIA 6.1 [3]. Using complete \(2\to 4\) matrix element might not be sufficient however, as only the direct \(g^{*}\to b\overline{b}\) splitting is taken into account. Just the cascade splitting like eg. \(g^{*}\to gg^{*}(\to b\overline{b})\) is not included; the splitting into heavy flavour quarks occurs directly at the first step of the cascade. The approximation used for the process of the gluon cascading into heavy flavour is more complete when using directly PYTHIA implementation of generating \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) hard process, with massless quarks and gluon, and involving parton shower afterwards. In that case the cascade splitting \(g^{*}\to gg^{*}(\to b\overline{b})\) is realised within the shower approximation. Using this second generation stream has however an obvious caveats: (a) the generation of the hard process itself is not reliable in the low range of the t-channel transfer of the hard process; (b) the \(2\to 2\) matrix element assumes on-shell gluon, the virtuality of the outgoing gluon is created with the parton shower approximation only and is not matching that one obtained from the complete \(2\to 4\) matrix element. Quantitative comparisons of these two generation streams are discussed in Section 2 of the paper. In the following in that Section is discussed also reweighting procedure for the \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) events, which would improve reliability of the generation algorithm in the region of the low t-channel transfer (low \(p_{T}^{W}\)) and enhance the high virtuality tail of the outgoing gluon (large \(m_{g^{*}}\)). Studied there are also few possible modifications of the parameters in the underlying showering model of PYTHIA 6.1.

The more complete generation streams, but simply \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) hard scattering, are discussed in Section 3. Here we access more inclusive W-boson productions, accompanied by the heavy flavour quarks. Namely, we generate \(2\to 1\), \(2\to 2\) and \(2\to 4\) processes at the hard scattering level, and allow for the partonic shower in the initial and final states. We compare quantitatively predictions on the distributions relevant for the experimental analysis.

As the complete evaluation of the expected \(Wb\overline{b}\) background should include its estimates for both irreducible and reducible components, the issue of establishing procedure for the appreciate Monte Carlo generation is crucial. Quantifying the discrepancies between different predictions is important because it could help to indicate how the simulation of the reducible \(Wb\bar{b}\) and \(Wjj\) backgrounds should be carried on.

Final conclusions are summarised in Section 4.

## 2 Matrix element versus partonic shower

The \(q\bar{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)b\bar{b}\) production is discussed below and predictions from two different approximations for generation streams are compared. The Fig. 1 illustrates these approaches.

* **(ME)**: Complete massive \(2\to 4\) matrix element \(q\bar{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\). This matrix element is not taking into account partonic cascade (higher orders) in the decay of the intermediate gluon \(g^{*}\). Once interfaced to PTTHIA 6.1, the partonic cascade from the \(g^{*}\to b\bar{b}\) primary tree can be also activated, but leads to the cascade separately from the \(b\) or \(\bar{b}\) quarks only.
* **(PS)**: The \(2\to 2\) matrix element \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\) with massless quarks and gluon followed by the parton shower for building gluon virtuality and gluon splitting \(g^{*}\to(g)b\bar{b}(g)\), and by W-boson semileptonic decay. The procedure of the partonic shower creates virtuality of the gluon, initially being on shell in the \(2\to 2\) matrix element, and adjust respectively kinematics of the intermediate \(g^{*}\) and W-boson. In this process \(g^{*}\) decays into cascade of quarks/gluons, a fraction of these decays include also splitting into heavy flavour. Just the \(g^{*}\to(g)b\bar{b}(g)\) denotes that the heavy flavour splitting might occur not as that one from the primary \(g^{*}\).

In the (ME) case we use complete \(2\to 4\) massive matrix element; in the (PS) case we factorise it into \(2\to 2\) matrix element with on-shell gluon, convoluted with the process of gluonic cascade/virtuality builded up and followed by the W-boson semileptonic decay. The most outstanding feature of the (PS) approach is that the matrix element is not corrected back afterwards to take into account builded up virtuality of the outgoing gluon. Ones the (ME) approach is strictly in a given order of the perturbative expansion, the (PS) approach represents a mixture of approximations in different orders of used for the description of the hard process and hadronisation/fragmentation.

Total cross-section times branching ratio, as generated with \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\) subprocess followed by the \(W\to\ell\nu\) decay (single flavour) down to the lowest technically allowed transverse momenta of the hard scattering process, (\(p_{T}^{hard}=2\) GeV), is \(\sim 21\ 000\) pb. Requiring \(p_{T}^{hard}>10\) GeV in the hard process frame, the \(\sigma\times BR\) becomes \(\sim 3\ 000\) pb. Just implemented matrix element with on-shell gluon is divergent at small \(p_{T}^{hard}\). Requiring in the event record two b-quarks originating from the gluon splitting and \(p_{T}^{W}>10\) GeV (after parton shower kinematics is in place), the \(\sigma\times BR\) is reduced to \(30\) pb only. Requiring \(p_{T}^{W}>10\) GeV obviously biases the sample as the transverse momenta of the W-boson is not reconstructed in the experimental analysis.

Figure 2: _The transverse momenta distribution of the W-boson. Compared are predictions from the complete (ME) \(2\to 4\) and from the \(2\to 2\) processes. Top: b-quarks not required in (PS) events; bottom: only events with heavy flavour content._

Respective total cross-section, calculated with the complete massive matrix element \(q\vec{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) is 33.3 pb. In this case the two b-quarks are present in each generated event. The cross-section is reduced to 25.0 pb if \(p_{T}^{W}>10\) GeV. At this stage, without imposing any selection on b-quarks, the (PS) predictions are 20% higher than the (ME) ones.

Fig. 2 (left-top plot) compares the transverse momentum distribution of the W-boson, between the complete matrix element (ME) and parton shower (PS) events. For the (PS) events the b-quark content of the \(g^{*}\) cascade has not been required. It is shown (right-top plot) that above \(p_{T}^{W}>40\) GeV roughly factor 30 would be sufficient to scale distribution from the complete matrix element with two b-quarks in the final state, to agreement with that from the inclusive \(q\vec{q}\to Wg\) production. One should notice however that for the low \(p_{T}^{W}\) this ratio is not flat, indicating discrepancies for that region between (PS) and (ME) generation streams2. Fig. 2 (right-bottom plot) shows the same distributions after requiring b-quarks in the final state. The effective branching ratio of the parton shower cascade, \(g^{*}\to(g)bb(g)\), turns out slightly higher than expected from the ratio of the inclusive \(p_{T}^{W}\) distributions. It leads to the (PS) predictions being 10% ro 20% above the (ME) ones in the wide range of the W-boson transverse momenta, \(p_{T}^{W}\,=\,30-200\) GeV.

Footnote 2: It should be also noticed that this ratio becomes flat down to the lower \(p_{T}^{W}\) values after requiring b-quarks in the gluonic cascade.

One of the key points for this comparison is in fact distribution of the virtuality of the gluon which initiates cascade \(g^{*}\to(g)b\bar{b}(g)\), because that distribution will determine final spectra of the reconstructed invariant mass of the b-jet system. The meanfull comparison with the complete \(2\to 4\) (ME) calculations should first investigate agreement of these distributions. For the phenomenological study discussed here interesting is region well above the threshold of the minimal mass of the two b-quarks \(m_{g^{*}}>>2m_{b-quark}\). Requiring eg. \(m_{g^{*}}>30\) GeV in the \(q\vec{q}\to Wg\) subprocess, after building up the gluon virtuality via mechanism of the partonic shower, reduces \(\sigma\times BR\) to 420 pb and, after additionally requiring two b-quarks in the cascade of the gluon splitting, reduces \(\sigma\times BR\) to 14 pb. Respective \(\sigma\times BR\) for the \(q\vec{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) process is 10.0 pb. Direct comparison of the above cross-sections might be interpreted 3 as observation that the cascade splitting \(g^{*}\to(g)bb(g)\) in the partonic shower gives effective branching fraction into heavy flavour quarks much higher in the (PS) events than in the (ME) calculations.

Footnote 3: The inclusive \(q\vec{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}\) cross-section has not been estimated independently with (ME) calculations, so we are not in the position of making this statement stronger.

The similar set of plots as in Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. 3, but as a function of the gluon virtuality \(m_{g^{*}}\). Here it is evident that the slope of the \(m_{g^{*}}\) distributions is very different for the (ME) and (PS) events. Ones the b-quarks are required in the (PS) events, the ratio becomes flat, around value 1.4 for the virtuality of the gluon below 120 GeV. For higher virtualities this ratio drops down rather rapidly. This indicates some discontinuity with which that distributions is modeled with the parton shower. As discussed latter, this apparent turning point could be shifted towards higher masses by changing the allowed scale of the parton shower evolution.

Recent discussion in [4] indicates that estimating the effective branching ratio into heavy flavours remains a subject of the large theoretical and experimental uncertainties. The effective branching ratio is plotted in Fig. 4 as a function of the \(p_{T}^{W}\) and of the \(m_{g^{*}}\). It is rising rather fast with increasing virtuality of the gluon: from 2% for \(m_{g^{*}}\sim\)20 GeV to about 10% for \(m_{g^{*}}\sim 20\) GeV. Here we don't have equivalent matrix element implementations with which we could compare these distributions. The fact, that the effective branching ratio seems to be higher than the predicted by the (ME) might as well be explained by the b-quark production in the cascade splitting being more abundant than in the direct \(g^{*}\to b\overline{b}\) production.

Figure 3: _The distribution of the mass of the virtual gluon \(g^{*}\). Compared are predictions from the \(2\to 4\) (ME) and from the \(2\to 2\) (PS) events. Top: b-quarks not required in (PS) events; bottom: only events with heavy flavour content._

Fig. 5 shows yet another differences between (ME) and (PS) events. What is compared there is the distribution of the virtuality of the gluon and invariant mass of the produced b-quarks system. The splitting between these both curves is due to the multi-parton showering in the cascade which was activated both for the (ME) and (PS) events. The effect is much stronger in the case of the (PS) events. This is rather obvious, in that case first step in the cascade is not necessarily splitting into b-quark pair, could be as well splitting into two gluons, one of them splitting latter into the b-quark pair. This leads to the further softening of the \(m_{bb-quarks}\) distribution with respect to the primary \(m_{g^{*}}\) distribution.

There are clearly several effects identified in the discussed above Figs. 2 - 5, which might partially cancel each other for the final distribution of the mass of the reconstructed b-jet system:

* Fraction of the effective gluon splitting into heavy flavour, considered as an average versus transverse momenta of the W-boson, is higher by 10 % to 20% in (PS) events than what predicted by the direct \(g\to b\overline{b}\) splitting in (ME) events. If compared versus virtuality of the gluon \(g^{*}\), in the large range of the \(m_{g^{*}}\) it is higher by 40 %.
* The distribution of the virtuality of the gluon in (PS) events is underpopulated in the high mass range.
* Evolution of the partonic cascade, so building up virtuality of the gluon, is modeled in the (PS) events including higher order corrections in the LL approximation. It leads to the softer b-quark spectrum with respect to the primary \(g^{*}\) spectrum than in the (ME) events.

While the first effect leads to increase of the effective cross-section for the \(Wb\overline{b}\) events, the second and the third ones would lead to the lower acceptance of the kinematical selection.

Few more distributions, illustrative for comparing the (ME) and (PS) events are shown in Fig. 6. The b-quark transverse momenta spectrum from the (ME) events is harder, \(<p_{T}>~{}=~{}18\) GeV, to be compared with \(<p_{T}>~{}=~{}12\) GeV from (PS) events. The invariant mass of the b-quark system is shifted to the lower values for the (PS) events, on average being \(<m_{bb-quarks}>~{}=~{}24\) GeV from the (ME) and \(<m_{bb-quarks}>~{}=~{}19\) GeV from the (PS) events. Distributions for cone separations \(R_{bb-quarks}\) and \(R_{bb-quark}\), respectively between b-quark pair and b-quark and lepton, are very similar in the (ME) and (PS) events. One can notice however that the (PS) events are populating more region with the small \(R_{bb-quarks}\). In both generation streams b-quarks have the tendency to be back-to-back with the lepton from the semileptonic W-boson decay.

### Weighting events with massive \(2\to 2\) matrix element

We discuss possibility to improve (PS) generation stream by weighting events with \(2\to 2\) (ME) which takes into account virtuality of the gluon \(g^{*}\). This weight is applied externally to the generation and defined as a ratio of the _off-shell_ to _on-shell_ matrix elements (the _on-shell_ matrix element is implemented in PYTHIA 6.1). The weight is calculated using kinematical variables after and before creation of the virtuality of the \(g^{*}\). It has the following form:

\[w=\frac{(\hat{u}_{P\,S}^{2}+\hat{t}_{P\,S}^{2}+2m_{3}^{2}\cdot\hat{s}+2m_{4}^{ 2}\cdot\hat{s})/\hat{u}_{P\,S}/\hat{t}_{P\,S}}{(\hat{u}^{2}+\hat{t}^{2}+2m_{3}^ {2}\cdot\hat{s})/\hat{u}/\hat{t}} \tag{1}\]

The \(\hat{s}\), \(\hat{u}\) and \(\hat{t}\) are Mandelstam variables calculated from the event kinematic in the hard scattering; \(\hat{u}_{P\,S}\) and \(\hat{t}_{P\,S}\) are calculated from the kinematics after final state radiation taking into account cascade initiated by the gluon produced in the hard scattering. The \(m_{3}^{2}\) denotes squared invariant mass of the W-boson, \(m_{4}^{2}\) denotes squared virtuality of the gluon calculated as the invariant mass of the cascade products from the gluon from hard scattering. All required information about event kinematics is easily accessible from the PYTHIA 6.1 event record.

The distribution of the event weight is shown in Fig. 7. It suppresses contributions at small transfers (small \(p_{T}^{W}\)) and enhances contributions from events with large virtuality of the cascading gluon (large \(m_{g^{*}}\)). For \(p_{T}^{\,W}>40\) GeV averaged weight is flat as a function of \(p_{T}^{W}\) and roughly at the value of 1.1. The averaged weight is also relatively flat as a function of \(m_{g^{*}}\) up to \(m_{g^{*}}\sim 1\,20\) GeV, where it starts rising fast. It is about 2.25 for \(m_{g^{*}}\sim 200\) GeV. This is consistent with correcting behaviour of the ratio (PS) distributions, which is underpopulated in the range of high gluon virtuality, as observed in Fig. 3 (bottom-right).

In Fig. 8 compared are \(p_{T}^{W}\) and \(m_{g^{*}}\) distributions for (ME) and (PS) events after reweighting procedure. Let us recall that PYTHIA 6.1 generator itself in the process of the final state radiation is correcting kinematics only, but leaves cross-section unchanged. Just the cross-section remains as initially calculated for the \(2\to 2\) hard scattering with on-shell gluon. One can observe that reweighting procedure brings shapes of the differential cross-sections as a function of both \(m_{g^{*}}\) and \(p_{T}^{W}\) distributions much closer to that of the (ME). As an effect of reweighting, the low \(p_{T}^{W}\) cross-section is regularised and the tail in the \(m_{g^{*}}\) distribution becomes much harder.

Figure 8: _The differential cross-sections and their ratios for the \(2\to 4\) (ME) and \(2\to 2\) (PS) events after requiring two b-quarks. Left-top: as the function of \(p_{T}^{W}\) (\(m_{g}^{*}>10\) GeV required); right-top: as the function of \(m_{g}^{*}\) (\(p_{T}^{W}>10\) GeV required). The (PS) events are weighted with massive \(2\to 2\) matrix element. No kinematical selection imposed on b-quarks._

Ratios of the differential cross-sections, (PS)/(ME), as a function of both \(p_{T}^{\,W}\) and \(m_{g^{*}}\), indicate constant relative normalisation factor of about 1.4. It can be interpreted as the fact that, after correcting for mass effects in the generation of hard scattering, the effective branching ratio for \(g^{*}\to(g)b\bar{b}(g)\) in (PS) events stabilizes at value about 1.4 higher than what predicted by the (ME) with direct \(g^{*}\to b\bar{b}\) splitting.

After reweighting, the total cross-section for the \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\) with \(W\to\ell\nu\) (single flavour) with \(p_{T}^{hard}>2\) GeV becomes 15 300 pb (instead of 21 000 pb). The weighting procedure has an obvious advantage of correctly regularising divergent matrix element of the hard process and not affecting tuning of the (PS) model itself. Applied weight is however still not sufficient to achieve full agreement with the shapes of the \(p_{T}^{\,W}\) and \(m_{g^{*}}\) distributions for the (ME) events. The agreement is nevertheless significantly better, compare Fig. 8 with Figs. 2 and 3.

### Non-default tuning of the (PS) model

One of the further or alternative possibilities for modifying (PS) predictions is to change internal parameters of the showering model. The modifications, which have been studied here, are given by the three options specified below:

* set 0: The default setting.
* set I: The tuning of the kinematics and branching ratio for the \(g^{*}\to b\bar{b}\) is possible in the event generation. It is controlled by the values of parameters MSTJ(42) and MSTJ(44). Value MSTJ(42)=MSTJ(44)=3, as recommended in [4], are used instead of the default ones.
* set II: The scale of the maximum parton virtuality allowed in the shower is set with respect to the \(Q^{2}\) scale of the hard scattering. The parameter PARP(71) is used to define this scale, the value PARP(71)=8 is used instead of the default one.

Fig. 9 shows comparison, for different options, of the differential cross-sections as a function of \(m_{g^{*}}\) and of \(p_{T}^{W}\). Roughly speaking they overlay each other, so neither of the specified above sets is able to reproduce correctly the \(2\to 4\) (ME) spectrum for the \(m_{g^{*}}\). With pushing up virtuality scale, like with set II, one can obtain the effect of shifting the range of the significantly different slope of the distributions into higher values of the \(m_{g^{*}}\). This is rather weakly controlled procedure, because affects the FSR shower model everywhere, while the primary reason of this disagreement is too crude approximation (matrix element with on-shell gluon not corrected for the virtuality of the gluon in the final state) used for the hard process generation.

Fig. 10 shows comparison, for different options, of the invariant mass, transverse momenta and opening cone of the b-quark pair and also opening cone of the b-quark and W boson. Plots are normalised to \(\sigma\times BR\) in pb. Clearly the most evident is the difference in the opening cone of the two b-quarks (between set 0 and set I) and in the \(m_{bb-quark}\) invariant mass spectra (between set 0 and set II). Set II gives the hardest virtuality tail in the \(m_{g^{*}}\) distribution.

Solid line is for events generated with default set 0, dashed for events generated with set I and dots for events generated with set II (see text). Plots normalised to \(\sigma\times BR\) in pb._

### Invariant mass of the b-jet system

Finally, we compare distributions obtained from the (ME), (PS) set 0 and (PS) weighted set II generation streams. The (PS) set 0 and (PS) weighted set II represent respectively _untuned_ and _best corrected_ (PS) generation streams. In each event sample, reconstruction of b-labeled jets4 is performed [5].

Footnote 4: Reconstruction of b-labeled jet means that the jet with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV (after energy recalibration) is reconstructed within pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\) and that the b-quark is present within the jet cone. One should not neglect however that process ofjets reconstruction/realibration might introduce additional systematical bias to the comparison between (ME) and (PS) predictions.

Table 1 quantifies comparison between (PS) predictions with different settings (with and without reweighting) and (ME) predictions. Consistently \(p_{T}^{W}>10\) GeV is required, applied after partonic shower.

For events where two b-jets are found, ratio between \(\sigma\times BR\) for (PS) and (ME) events is reduced from factor 1.2 to even below 1.0. Just the acceptance within kinematical cuts (transverse momenta and pseudorapidity) and reconstruction efficiency of b-labelled jets is higher for (ME) events. Very different, as observed already for the b-quark system, is the tail of the invariant mass spectrum of b-jet pair in accepted sample; (ME) events have much harder tail in the higher mass range and also harder \(p_{T}^{b-jet}\) spectrum, and less populated region of small \(R_{b\mathbf{b-jets}}\) separation. Figs. 11 shows comparison of these distributions.

Shown are also results after reweighting (PS) events. The 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy and CTEQ5L structure functions were used for the simulation. Consistently, the \(p_{T}^{W}>10\) GeV is required for all samples, applied after partonic shower. As specified, FSR, followed by the hadronisation were activated with different settings. No kinematic selection is imposed on the b-quarks. Fiducial cuts for lepton and b-jets are: transverse momenta \(p_{T}>15\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\). Efficiencies for b-tagging and lepton identification are not included._Fig. 12 shows estimates of the final mass spectra, with and without requiring threshold on the minimal \(R_{bb-jets}\) cone separation. Clearly, event rates for \(\ell b\overline{b}\) final state with \(m_{bb-jets}>100\) GeV, if generated with (PS) generated streams are underpopulated with respect to the (ME) predictions. This is directly related to the fact that the shape of the \(m_{g^{*}}\) spectrum is too soft, and not to the effective fraction of the \(g^{*}\to b\overline{b}\) splittings being too small. In fact, the initial fraction of events with two b-quarks has rates 20% higher than the predicted from the (ME) calculations.

It was checked, that the fact of imposing \(p_{T}^{\,W}>10\) GeV threshold in the (ME) sample has negligible impact on the final rates of reconstructed \(\ell b\overline{b}\) events. Also the requirement about minimal \(R_{bb-jets}\) separation, \(R_{bb-jets}>0.7\), have the minimal impact on the expected number of events in the mass window \(m_{bb-jets}=100-140\) GeV. It has the impact however on the slope of the \(m_{bb-jets}\) distribution in the lower mass range. Just with rising threshold on the \(R_{bb-jets}\), events from the low mass range get removed.

reconstruction, (PS) approach is effectively overpopulating low \(R_{bb-jets}\) and low \(m_{bb-jets}\) ranges and underpopulating the large \(m_{bb-jets}\) range.

The (PS) predictions can be tuned to some extend by rising maximum virtuality scale for the showering. Also they can be corrected, on the level of the calculations of the hard scattering matrix element, by reweighting events. The _best corrected_ (PS) distribution is shown in Fig. 12 with dashed line. The (PS) predictions turns out to be systematically lower than (ME) ones, despite the fact of the higher effective branching ration for the \(g^{*}\to b\overline{b}\) splitting. One can conclude that for events with \(R_{bb-jets}>0.7\), the (PS) weighted set II is still 40% lower than the (ME) distributions but the ratio of (PS)/(ME) distributions becomes almost flat in the mass range \(m_{bb-jet}>60\) GeV. This is the most relevant range, with respect to the overall shape and normalisation, for the Higgs search in WH, \(H\to b\overline{b}\) channel at LHC. The additional contribution from the initial state bremsstrahlung (ISR) is less than 10% in the mass range \(m_{bb-jets}=60-140\) GeV.

## 3 What is the \(Wb\bar{b}\) irreducible background?

As already briefly discussed in the introductory section, the \(q\bar{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) process, although dominant, is not the only source of events with \(\ell b\bar{b}\) final state. In the formalism of \(2\to 2\) hard scattering also the \(qg\to Wq\) production will contribute to this background with \(g^{*}\to b\bar{b}\) splitting in the cascade of final or initial state radiation. Contributions from these both subprocesses \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\) and \(qg\to Wq\) should be added together for the consistent approach of \(2\to 2\) matrix element. Alternatively one can say that the inclusive \(q\bar{q}\to W\) production with heavy flavour quarks production in the evolution of the structure functions (ISR) is the more complete description of all sources of the \(\ell\,b\bar{b}\) final state.

Here we discuss different available generation streams which can be used for estimating irreducible \(Wb\bar{b}\) background. By (PS) we indicate these generation streams where the decay \(g^{*}\to b\bar{b}\) appear as a step in the cascade of the parton shower. By (ME) we indicate that stream where \(g^{*}\to b\bar{b}\) decay is included in the matrix element of the hard process.

* **(ME):** Use \(2\to 4\) matrix element for \(q\bar{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) process as implemented in [2]. The \(\sigma\times BR=33.3\) pb single leptonic flavour W-boson decay. The \(g^{*}\to b\bar{b}\) splitting is coded already at the level of the matrix element. This matrix element represents lowest order contribution to the \(\ell b\bar{b}\) final state.
* **(PS):** Use \(2\to 2\) matrix element \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\) and \(qg\to Wq\) processes as implemented in PYTHIA. With the threshold \(p_{T}^{hard}>10\) GeV, the \(\sigma\times BR=6220\) pb for \(qg\to Wq\) and \(30\,20\) pb for \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\). Gluon splitting in the ISR and FSR partonic cascades is the source of b-quarks in the event. Both contributions should be added. The threshold \(p_{T}^{hard}>10\) GeV is imposed as \(2\to 2\) matrix elements are divergent at low transfers in the t-channel. This cut is however not imposed explicitly in the experimental selection procedure so introduces bias on the generated sample.
* **(PS):** Use \(2\to 1\) matrix element for \(q\bar{q}\to W\) process as implemented in PYTHIA, followed by the ISR. The \(\sigma\times BR=17320\) pb for \(q\bar{q}\to W\) production. Gluon splitting in the ISR partonic cascade is the source of b-quarks in the event. The ISR cascade for this process has been coded with the dedicated procedure to match first order matrix element calculations of the \(p_{T}^{W}\) spectra and shows very good agreement [6] with the Tevatron data.

In the parton shower approach _a priori_ higher order corrections are already included at least in the leading log approximation. Only the lowest order term for the \(g^{*}\to b\bar{b}\) splitting is present in the matrix element calculations. However, as we use \(2\to 4\) matrix element with activated ISR and FSR, the higher order corrections are also to some extend included. They might introduce slightly shifted kinematics of the event and/or additional branching eg. \(b\to bg\). What is not included in the \(2\to 4\) matrix element calculations is contribution from events where gluon/quark interacts in the hard process to produce \(W\)-boson, but the gluon splitting into b-quarks occurs in the further steps of the cascade. As well not included is contribution where final state gluon in the hard process decay into light quarks, while b-quarks appear in another branch of the parton shower.

We start this comparison by looking more closely at the two components of the \(2\to 2\) matrix element, the \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) and \(qg\to Wq\) processes5.

Footnote 5: For consistency the reweighting procedure discussed in the Section 2 for the \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) events is not applied here, as the similar procedure was not prepared for the \(qg\to Wq\) process.

Fig. 13 shows the \(p_{T}^{W}\) spectra obtained with these subprocesses. They are clearly different in shape, also the overall normalisation indicates that the \(qg\to Wq\) production mechanism is a dominant one. However its contribution drops rapidly with \(p_{T}^{W}\) and for the \(p_{T}^{W}>100\) GeV dominant becomes the \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) production.

Contribution from the \(2\to 2\) subprocess \(qg\to Wq\) itself to the \(Wb\overline{b}\) events is significant, as the density of the gluon structure function is strongly enhanced. Predicted shape of the \(m_{bb-jet}\) distribution is different for the \(qg\to Wq\) and \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) subprocesses, as shown in Fig. 14. In case of the \(qg\to Wq\) process it shows the double-peak structure, likely the effect from the jets reconstruction/calibration procedure. This structure is removed only after events with \(R_{bb-jet}\ >\ 0.7\) are required. The contribution from this subprocess is dominant in the mass window \(m_{bb-jets}=80-120\) GeV but for higher masses is below that from the \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) subprocesses. It is clearly an issue, as the relative contributions from these subprocesses is changing rapidly in the mass range of interest.

For the further evaluation of the generation streams contributions from both \(qg\to Wq\) and \(q\overline{q}\to Wg\) subprocesses are added together. In Fig. 15 compared are the transverse momenta spectra of the W boson simulated with \(2\to 1\), \(2\to 2\) and \(2\to 4\) processes. All events were filtered on the presence of b-quarks in the cascade but kinematical selection was not imposed on the b-quarks. As shown in the plots, the shape of the \(p_{T}^{W}\) distribution is in better agreement between \(2\to 1\) and \(2\to 4\) processes. This is the effect of the dedicated improvement of the modeling of the parton shower presently implemented in

PYTHIA 6.1 for the \(q\bar{q}\to W\) subprocess. But, as also can be concluded from the ratio of these distributions, both shapes and normalisations are very different between all three generation streams.

In Fig. 16 and 17, compared are directly differential distributions between \(2\to 2\) and \(2\to 4\) processes (Fig. 16) and between \(2\to 1\) and \(2\to 4\) processes (Fig. 17). Plotted are distributions relevant for the experimental analyses. They are significantly different, just illustrating the fact that any attempt towards optimising selection will be very biased by the approach which have been used for the generation of the background events.

Solid line is for events generated with \(2\to 4\) matrix element, dashed with sum of \(2\to 2\) matrix elements followed by the parton shower. Generation as for Fig. 15._

In the specific mass window of the b-jets system invariant mass, estimates from different generation streams can be very different as the slope of the \(m_{bb\mathbf{-}jets}\) distribution is very different in above cases. This is illustrated in Fig. 18 - 19. In general, gluon splitting in the parton shower underpopulates events with higher \(m_{bb\mathbf{-}jet}\) masses, despite initial larger effective branching ratio of the \(g^{\ast}\rightarrow(g)b\bar{b}(g)\) splitting than predicted by the matrix element. Threshold on b-jets cone separation, \(R_{bb\mathbf{-}jets}\,>0.7\), has almost no impact on the number of events accepted in the specified mass windows. The same is true for the \(p_{T}^{W}\,\,>10\) GeV threshold applied on the generation of the \(2\to 2\) subprocesses.

Fig. 18 shows estimates for the final mass spectra and their ratio between \(2\to 2\) and \(2\to 4\) processes. Plotted are distributions for events with \(R_{bb\mathbf{-}jets}\,>0.7\) and with/without jet-veto on an additional jet. Requiring jet-veto on any additional jet is the selection

imposed in the analysis for the Higgs boson observability. It is clear that slopes of the distributions are more converging after jet-veto. Similar plots but comparing \(2\to 1\) and \(2\to 4\) distributions are shown in Fig. 19. Consistently also in this case slopes of the distributions are more converging after jet-veto is applied. This is only to be expected as with such hard jet-veto the topology becomes closer to the one directly generated by the (ME) approach.

Estimates from the \(2\to 1\) process are in better agreement with the (ME) ones than these from the \(2\to 2\) subprocesses. This process is predicting comparable rates for \(m_{bb-jets}>80\) GeV and no jet-veto, and rates lower by 50% if jet-veto is required. Simulation with \(2\to 2\) processes is predicting higher rates in the large \(m_{bb-jets}\) region with respect to the \(2\to 4\) (ME) calculations, consistently lower rates if jet-veto is required. The higher rates predicted by (PS) generation streams are consistent with the fact that the \(g^{\,*}\to(g)b\overline{b}(g)\) splitting is taken into account both in the final and initial state. Also the comparison between inclusive two b-quarks rates in \(q\bar{q}\to Wg^{*}(\to b\overline{b})\) and \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\) processes indicated that the effective fraction of the \(g^{*}\to(g)b\overline{b}(g)\) splitting is higher in the parton shower implementation than predicted by the direct \(g^{*}\to b\overline{b}\) splitting. This ratios of (PS)/(ME) distributions are more flat for (PS) events generated with \(2\to 1\) process than these generated with \(2\to 2\) processes.

In both cases predictions from (PS) events are above these from the (ME) without applying jet-veto, and are below after applying jet-veto. The jet-veto obviously introduces new, not so easy to control element to this comparison. Just the jet-veto rejects more events from the (PS) generation stream than from the (ME) one. In neither of the cases we found the agreement between the slopes of the distributions.

Conclusions

The aim of presented studies was to quantify and if possibly better understand differences between different generation streams which can be used for evaluation of the irreducible \(Wb\overline{b}\) background.

Complete matrix element \(q\overline{q}\to W(\to\ell\,\nu)g^{*}(\to b\overline{b})\) is a very good reference generation stream. Generation with the \(2\to 1\) or \(2\to 2\) matrix elements for W-boson production, followed by the partonic shower, gives predictions where several components are not that easy to control. Depending on the tuning of the shower evolution energy scale, approach for matching of the \(2\to 1\) and higher order matrix elements, treatment of the events with low transfer at the hard scattering, predictions might differ significantly.

In the process of the evaluation presented here several effects which might add or cancel each other became visible: (a) fraction of effective gluon splitting into heavy flavour seems to be factor 1.4 higher in (PS) events than in (ME) events; (b) the distribution of the virtuality of the gluon in (PS) events is underpopulated in the high mass range; (c) evolution of the partonic cascade is more realistically modeled in the (PS) events and leads to the softer b-quark spectrum than in the (ME) events.

What is the irreducible \(Wb\overline{b}\) background? The question remains still open. _Rough guess_ is that, for the mass window 80-140 GeV, somewhere between 1 - 2 times above the complete matrix element calculations for \(2\to 4\) process if jet-veto is not applied. Applying very hard jet-veto brings the predictions from \(2\to 1\) and \(2\to 2\) processes below expectations from the matrix element \(2\to 4\) process. The differences between differential distributions from different approaches indicates that it would be still rather too soon to start process of the cuts optimization. One needs to understand and control much better the Monte Carlo predictions first. Important step in this direction, as the calculations of the NLO corrections to the \(q\overline{q}\to Wb\overline{b}\) process are available [7], would be understanding how they compare with the (PS) predictions.

At this point one would rather recommend using \(2\to 1\) subprocess in PYTHIA 6.1 than the sum of the \(2\to 2\) subprocesses for the simulation of irreducible and reducible backgrounds (\(Wb\overline{b}\), \(Wbj\) and \(Wjj\)). It shows better and more stable overall agreement with the \(2\to 4\) (ME) calculations and does not require dedicated treatment of the divergent range of the low \(p_{T}^{\,W}\).

Finally, it might be worthwhile to list a few key points regarding the presented (ME) and (PS) comparison:

* Parton showering approach is a semi-phenomenological model and with this respect can be tuned to match the data collected by the previous HEP experiments; this in turn strongly speaks in favour of its power of prediction. The (PS) also provides an 'inclusive' treatment of processes in view of that it in principle models a process to any order (e.g. \(gg\to b\overline{b}+n\)jets). On the other hand, the parton showering is in essence nothing more than Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi (GLAP) equations in a very sophisticated implementation; thus the implicit assumption for the (PS) modeling to work is that any hard process (+ higher order corrections) can sort of be expanded into a 'Taylor series' of GLAP diagrams, which is in itself very efficient approach; its validity for the general case is however not on firm theoretical grounds6.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:26]

the final selection one is thus usually left with a sample of events with a very clean topology that can be accurately described only by the hard (ME) implementation (the following parton showering and fragmentation are mostly important for accurate kinematic reconstruction studies..). This is why for example at LEP the MC generators used were made with tree level diagrams only (+ FSR + ISR parton showering in GLAP form), and they still described the data with a high level of accuracy.

The aim of the studies presented in this note is essentially to compare the matrix element and parton shower approach at the level of intermediate cuts, i.e. somewhere in between the two extremes described above, where the two approaches should (approximately) match. In the absence of data this is assumed to be useful for cross-checks on the predictions of the two approaches as well as for developing reasonable estimates of significances, efficiencies etc.. of the future analyses.
