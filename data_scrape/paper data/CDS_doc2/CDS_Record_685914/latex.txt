**Abstract**

A technical proposal on an X-ray test station for the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker is presented. At the first stage one section of a TRT endcap ( " wheel" ) is planning to be calibrated using the existing PNPI X-ray apparatus with 36 keV narrow beam. A device providing the possibility to direct the X-ray beam to a chosen direction within some solid angle, supplied with an angle position measurement system which is planned to be designed and constructed, bearing in mind a possibility to use this Beam Directing Device ( BDD ) for calibration of other subsystems of the ATLAS Inner Detector. A R&D program preceding the test station design and construction period is also discussed.

## 1 Introduction.

Precision position knowledge of Straw Proportional Tube ( SPT ) wires in the TRT is an important physics requirement necessary to minimise error in detecting and tracking high energy particles that are deflected by the magnetic field within the ATLAS Inner Detector. A manufacturing precision, in spite of quite stringent tolerances, can not guarantee the necessary SPT wire position accuracy. An independent space calibration of the wire positions is eagerly desirable.

Recently an X-ray diagnostic device for measuring SPT wire positions has been developed [1, 2]. A narrow 36 keV energy monochromatic beam irradiated an array of the SPT assembled in a endcap section ("wheel") cell prototype. It was shown that wire position determination accuracy below one micron was attainable. We are planning to use on the first stage this X-ray installation with the X-ray beam parameters at a monochromator exit slit as following:

\begin{tabular}{l l} energy & 36.03 keV \\ intensity & 2000 1/ sec \\ width & 50 \(\upmu\)m \\ height & 22 mm \\ horizontal. divergence & \(\pm\)55\(\upmu\)rad \\ vertical divergence & \(\pm\)42 mrad \\ X-ray tube current & 19 \(\upmu\)A \\ X-ray tube voltage & 95 keV \\ \end{tabular} The X-ray apparatus with the monochromator in a unit block has to be installed on a device providing the possibility to direct the X-ray beam to a chosen direction within some solid angle. The BDD should be supplied with a co-ordinate measuring system. Two options of the BDD have been considered.

### Comparison of the BDD options

Taking into consideration the SPT configuration ( radial in the endcap) together with the X-ray beam form one can conclude that the cylindrical or the spherical co-ordinate systems are preferable compared to the rectangular one as in the later case essential noncoliniarity of the wires and the X-ray beam cross-section in the longitudinal direction produces essential broadening of wire profiles. The cylindrical geometry considered in [2] seems to be the most suitable for the "wheel" calibration, however it is less universal compared with the spherical one considered in [3] for GEM Muon system global alignment. Keeping in mind a possibility to usethis BDD for calibration of other ID subsystem we have chosen the spherical geometry in spite of two drawbacks, namely :

Due to larger distance between the X-ray unit exit slit and the "wheel" the wire profiles will be broader,

There is no internal linear scale in the BDD.

**2. General.**

A schematic view of the "wheel" calibration geometry is shown in Fig.1. The "wheel" and the BDD are placed on their independent supports, so that a BDD horizontal axis of rotation approximately coincides with the "wheel" symmetry axis. The BDD should provide turning around two rectangular axes. An angle range around the horizontal (polar, CC in Fig.1) axis has to be slightly more than 360\({}^{\circ}\) and an angle range around rectangular (elevation, OO in Fig. 1 ) has to be about \(\pm\)60\({}^{\circ}\). Angle positioning might be realised with a worm and wheel transmission driven by stepping motors via additional gears.1 For precise angle measurements Angle Encoders ( AE ) connected directly with the axes seem to be adequate.

**2.1 Draft design.**

A draft design of the BDD with the X-ray unit is shown schematically in Fig. 2. The "wheel" (2) is attached to a three point support (1) supplied with adjustment screws to put the "wheel"s symmetry axis horizontal at a height of \(\sim\)1400 mm from the floor. The X-ray unit (4) is fixed on a frame (5) turning around the OO axis by a stepping motor (7) via a double-reduction gear transmission (6). The first AE ( Absolute Rotary Encoder, ( ARE ) or Incremental Angle Encoder ( IAE ), not seen in Fig. 2 ) is connected with a shaft with a flexible coupling. Shaft bearings are fastened at a frame (8),connected rigidly to a shaft (9), turning around the horizontal axis in two bearings (10) installed on a bed frame (11). Angle positioning is realised with the second double- reduction gear and stepping motor (12).For precise angle measurement an IAE (13) is used. The BDD bed frame supplied with legs (15) for adjustment in vertical and horizontal directions is placed on some available rigid table (14) which simplifies the adjustment procedure.

### Design requirements and tolerances.

As mentioned above, it is desirable to design the BDD applicable for alignment of other subsystem of the Inner Detector and, if possible, for the assembled ID. Pixels in forward and barrel regions have been chosen as the highest precision elements of the ID. Using required spatial resolution values, listed in [4], and assumption that a calibration error should not exceed 1/3 of the resolution, one can estimate the calibration error for the "wheel" to be about 50 \(\upmu\)m and for the pixels about 5 \(\upmu\)m in the axial direction and about 30 \(\upmu\)m in the radial one. Taking into account a radial distance ( up to 1000 mm for the SPT and about 200 mm for the pixels ) and a distance between the detector to be measured and the BDD ( about 1200 mm and 5000 mm for the pixels in the assembled ID ) one can obtain the following sets of requirements and tolerances: Set 1 for the "wheel" calibration, Set 2 for the barrel calibration, Set 3 for the endcap and Set 4 a, b for the pixels calibration in the assembled ID, ( 4a - only the axial co-ordinate, 4b - the axial and the radial ones ). The main requirements listed in Table 1 has been calculated under assumption that, all errors originated from X-beam position instability, two axes wobble, angle ( \(\Phi\) ) measuring error, calibration error, and statistical error can be added with m. s. r. procedure with equal weight.2 Note : the endcap calibration and the calibration in the assembled ID is supposed to do with high power X-ray tube supplied with a double flat crystal monochromator; the Set 4 requirements are also sufficient for the assembled ATLAS Muon system projective calibration and alignment.

Footnote 2: Only 4 errors are supposed to be essential for Set 4, as the statistical error can be decreased due to essential increase of the X-ray beam intensity and high registration efficency, the calibration error is not important due to small radial distance.

### Requirements to the X-ray unit.

The existing X-ray unit ( see Fig. 3, 4 ) that is supposed to be used for the first two stages, was not designed to work in rotating devices. A supporting frame and the monochromator might need reconstructing after test ( see "A & D program" section ) to fulfil Set 1, 2 stability requirements. The unit should be supplied with adjustment devices ( see section "Adjustment procedure" ). An additional shield against a background should be optimised so that the unit weight with the shield will be not larger than 20 kg.

**2.4 Requirements to the polar axis unit.**

An angle range should not be less than 370\({}^{\circ}\). The shaft design should provide possibility to directly connect an incremental angle encoder. A backlash in the gear transmission has to be less than 1/10 of the angle measurement accuracy.

**2.5 Requirements to the elevation axis unit.**

An angle range of \(\pm\)60\({}^{\circ}\) is chosen to increase an X-ray beam incident beam angle for back ends of the barrel wires and makes it possible to adjust the X-ray beam relative to the BDD ( see section "Adjustment procedure"). The angle measurement precision and resolution has been chosen so that one can neglect a projection of a \(\Theta\) error on a \(\Phi\) error ( see "Measurement procedure" ). A backlash in the gear transmission has to be less than 1/10 of the angle measurement accuracy.

**2.6 The axes crossing angle.**

If the axes crossing angle differs from the right one, a trace of the X-ray beam on a wire plane should be a hyperbola instead of a straight line ( we consider the case when the polar axis coincides with the X-ray direction, see "Adjustment procedure" and Appendix 1). Results of measurements have to be corrected, if the difference is greater than values listed in the upper line of Table 1. In the lower line limits are listed for the case when the calibration procedure can provide 10% accuracy in the crossing angle determination.

**2.7 Requirements to air condition.**

Temperature stabilisation have to be done within \(\pm\)1\({}^{\circ}\) for Sets 1,2,3 and about 0.1\({}^{\circ}\) for Set 4. Humidity should be measured.

**2.8 Reference marks.**

We consider here temporary reference marks applicable for the "wheel" calibration, that can be used during the measurement with a theodolite and with the X-ray beam. Detailed description is placed below in "Adjustment procedure".

**2.9 Additional requirement.**

It is desirable to take into account the possibility to install on the BDD in future, a high power X-ray tube unit. Being of the same weight ( with an additional shield ) the power tube is connected with HV supply unit by a rigid cable bending of which applied to the BDD movable frame additional forces variable within several kg.

**3. Adjustment procedure for the "wheel" calibration.**

The adjustment procedure consists of two consecutive steps: the adjustment of the X-ray beam relative to the BDD and adjustment of BDD relative to the "wheel".

**3.1 The X-ray beam adjustment.**

The goals of the adjustment are following:

- to diminish eccentricity of the X-ray beam below 10 \(\upmu\)m ( narrow side ),

and about 100 \(\upmu\)m in the perpendicular direction,

- to put the X-ray beam direction in coincidence with the horizontal (polar)

axis with the accuracy not worse than 3 arc sec in the X-ray beam low

divergent plane and about 30-40 arc sec in the perpendicular plane,

- to measure the axis crossing angle with accuracy of 10 arc sec.

**3.1.1 The procedure.**

A sketch of a set-up for the adjustment is shown in Fig. 5. A tungsten ( or Cu Be bronze ) wire 50 - 100 \(\upmu\)m in diameter ( 1 ), serving as a thread for

a plumb is placed into the X-ray beam closely to the exit slit ( 2 ). The

beam profile is measured using the wire shadow on a Na J detector ( 3 ),

placed behind the wire on a rack ( 4 ). A wire support is placed on a

movable table ( 5 ), that provides accurate movement in a short range of 5

- 10 mm. The profile measurement is repeated for the X- ray beam position turned around the horizontal axis on 180\({}^{\circ}\).Using adjustment screws and

digital indicators, installed on the X-ray unit frame one can decrease the

eccentricity below desirable level. The same adjustment devices are used

to make coincidence between the X- ray beam direction and the BDD

horizontal axis. The moveable table is shifted on some distance ( 500 - 700 mm ) from the exit slit. The axes crossing angle is measured by the same

method, measuring the beam profiles at different height positions, using the BDD angle measuring system.

**3.1.2 The BDD adjustment relative to the "wheel".**

For the first step of the adjustment a theodolite should be used. After a

triangulation procedure to measure "wheel" dimensions and position, and

the "wheel" position stability, a tungsten wire cross has to be placed into acentral hole of the "wheel" support under control with the theodolite (another option is to make a wire cross on the whole "wheel" ). The next steps of the adjustment can be done with the theodolite placed in turn behind the BDD and the "wheel", using a mark placed on the BDD centre and "wheel" reference marks on one side, and the wire cross in the hole and the X-ray unit exit slit, irradiated by a light source trough a frosted glass put behind the slit on the other side.

**3.1.3 Reference marks and connecting "wheel" and BDD co-ordinate systems. Calibration of a linear scale.**

To connect two co-ordinate systems the reference marks ( at least 4 of them ) have to be applicable both for measurement with the theodolite and with the X-ray beam. One of the possible solution is to put the wire cross over the light marks. The second one is to prepare special optical marks from metallic foil ( copper alloy, tungsten, lead, nickel ) 100 - 200 \(\mu\)m of thickness, with crossed slits \(\sim\) 50 - 100 \(\mu\)m in width coated with a paint transparent for the X-rays. The Na J detector placed in sequence behind the marks is supposed to serve for a signal registration. For wire position description the distance between the BDD axes crossing point and the wire plane has to be known with relative accuracy about \(2^{\bullet}10^{\text{-3}}\). One of the ways to calibrate the linear scale is to measure elevation angle ( \(\Theta\) ) between upper and lower marks. The marks have to be supplied with metallic strips of 5 mm width glued to the optical marks at known distance from the optical cross for the first option, or with an additional slit of 5 mm width in the second option.

**4. Measurement procedure.**

Wire projections on the X Y plane are straight lines at the first approximation. The aim of the measurement to find a line equation parameters, chosen in the following form:

\[\text{ ( x - a) tan }\Phi\text{ - y = 0}\]

here \(\Phi\) is an angle relative to the X axis, "a " is a segment on the X axis cut by the line (see Fig. 6 ). For the ideal adjustment (zero eccentricity in both directions : r=0, e=0 ) wire profile have to be measured turning the X-ray beam around the BDD horizontal axis for two values of the elevation angle \(\Theta_{1}\)and \(\Theta_{2}\). Using profile centre of gravity values \(\varphi_{1}\) and \(\varphi_{2}\), value of d - distance between the BDD axes crossing point and the wire plane, one can calculate the wire line parameters, using the following formulae:

\[\Phi\text{=Arc tan }[\text{ ( tan }\Theta_{2}\text{ sin}\varphi_{2}\text{ -tan }\Theta_{1}\text{ sin}\varphi_{1}\text{ ) / ( tan }\Theta_{2}\text{ cos}\varphi_{2}\text{-tan }\Theta_{1}\text{ cos}\varphi_{1}\text{)]}\]\(a=d\tan\Theta_{1}\tan\Theta_{2}\sin(\varphi_{2}-\varphi_{1})/(tan\Theta_{2}\sin \varphi_{2}-tan\Theta_{1}\sin\varphi_{1})\)

and polar distance is

\(p=|\,d\tan\Theta_{1}\tan\Theta_{2}\sin(\varphi_{2}-\varphi_{1})/[tan^{2}\Theta_{1} -2\tan\Theta_{1}\tan\Theta_{2}\cos(\varphi_{2}-\varphi_{1})+tan^{2}\Theta_{2}]^{ 1/2}\,|\)

If \(\varphi_{2}-\varphi_{1}\equiv\Delta\Phi<<1\) then:

\(\Phi\equiv\mbox{Arc tan}\) ([1-tan \(\Theta_{1}\cot\Theta_{2}\)tan \(\varphi_{1}\))+\(\Delta\Phi\))] / [(1-tan \(\Theta_{1}\cot\Theta_{2}\))-\(\Delta\Phi\) tan \(\varphi_{1}\)],

\(a\equiv d\,\Delta\Phi/(cot\Theta_{1}\sin\varphi_{2}\)-cot \(\Theta_{2}\sin\varphi_{1})\),

\(p\equiv|\,d\,\Delta\Phi/(cot\Theta_{1}\)-cot \(\Theta_{2})\,|\),

and connection between \(\Phi\) error (\(\delta\Phi\)) produced by \(\Theta\) error (\(\delta\Theta_{1}\)=\(\delta\Theta_{2}\)=\(\delta\Theta\)) is described by the following formula:

\(\delta\Phi=\delta\Theta\,\Delta\Phi\) [(\(\sin 2\Theta_{1}\))\({}^{2}+(\sin 2\Theta_{2})^{2}\,]^{1/2}\sin^{2}(\Theta_{2}\)-\(\Theta_{1})\).

The "p" error equals:

\(\delta p=[\,(\Delta\Phi\ \delta d)^{2}/(cot\Theta_{1}-cot\Theta_{2})^{2}+(d \,\delta\Delta\Phi)^{2}/(cot\Theta_{1}-cot\Theta_{2})^{2}+\)

\(+(d\,\Delta\Phi\ )^{2}(cosec^{4}\,\Theta_{1}+cosec^{4}\,\Theta_{2})(\delta\Theta)^{2} \,/\,(cot\Theta_{1}-cot\Theta_{2})^{4}\,]^{1/2}\).

One can see that requirements to \(\Theta\) and "d" measuring accuracy depends on the "p" value which is the algebraic sum of a wire line polar distance relative to a wires position symmetry centre and a radius-vector projection on the p direction. The wires position symmetry centre unknown before the measurement will be found as a result of averaging p(\(\alpha\)) measured values. The numbers listed in Table 1for Sets 1,2,3 are calculated under assumption that p \(\leq\) 2 mm, and the \(\delta\Theta\) error yields into \(\delta\Phi\) error budget about 5 %. Note that the requirement to \(\delta\Delta\Phi\) error imposes restriction mainly on the angle position resolution.

If the residual eccentricity parameters remain to be essential after the adjustment, corrections should be inserted into the formulae. These corrections do not impose additional restrictions. The corresponding formulae are placed in Appendix 2.

**5. Realisation. Cost estimation.**

The existing apparatus with the monochromator and spare tubes with the cost about 53 kSF, including necessary modernisation, is not included into cost list, being the PNPI responsibility. Design cost and electronics for the wire signal processing are not considered here also.

**5.1** The following options have been considered, keeping in mind the possibility to use some units or the BDD for several tasks.

**5.1.1** Zero option. We have not found any commercial two axes device, that takes minimal reconstruction, with appropriate technical parameters and price. Two axes rotary stage AOM 360 D, produced by AEROTECH LTD., being the closest to our requirements, does not completely satisfy Set 1 parameters (axis wobble not less than 3 arc sec ) and has a price 200 kSF for the unit with a relevant electronics. Multi-axes devices especially designed for investigations with X-rays (HUBER GMBH.) have angle precision about 30 arc sec and price with electronics around 100 kDM.

**5.1.2** In options discussed below it is supposed that the mechanical unit has to be designed and constructed especially. The design variant briefly described above has been chosen, as it seems to be relatively cheap and provides a possibility to borrow some units for the first tests. Some variants of the unit choice are listed in Table 2.

**5.1.3** We propose to choose the combined solution, as it satisfies to Set 1,2,3 requirements and takes changing only one angle measuring device ( RON 905 instead of ROC 417 ) and two additional units AWE 1024 for the most precise version. As mentioned above, for this version the installation should be supplied with a new X-ray beam unit providing more intensive and stable beam but this is to be considered separately. We suggest to design and construct the mechanical unit in St. Petersburg as it is cheaper and PNPI will have possibility to share expenses, so that 20 kSF, including transportation expenses, are needed. Additional advantage of this suggestion is a possibility to correct quickly the unit design according to results of the X- ray beam stability test.

**5.1.4** Below there is the list of items which have to be constructed (c ), bought ( b ), or borrowed ( br ) and that are not included in the list of the BDD Main Components:

1. BDD bed frame c

2. rigid table br

3. shaft to AE couplings b

4. "wheel" marks c

5. Na J detector br, or b

6. detector rack c

7. plumb with support c, b

8. movable table br

9. 4 digital or clock

indicators br, or b 

## 6 R&D program.

We will consider here only two urgent items that have to be developed before and during design period, namely: the X-beam long-term stability and stability in the X-ray unit turning, and the choice of the most optimal X-ray energy. To carry out the X-ray beam stability investigation an auxiliary installation schematically shown in Fig. 7, is planned to construct. The X-ray unit (1) is mounted within a frame (2) at the end of which an entrance slit (3) of Na J detector (4) is fastened. The entrance slit has to be supplied with a device that fixes the slit alternatively on the left and right slopes of the X-ray beam profile. Relative adjustment of two slits has to be done using prototypes of the X-ray unit adjustment devices ( see above ). The frame which can be turned in bearings (5) is installed on a platform (6) that can be inclined within \(\pm 60^{\circ}\) angle range.

The X- ray energy optimisation can be done with the existing equipment.

**7. Time schedule.**

It takes 3.5 months for the design, including the first item of the R&D program and 2\(\div\)3 months for construction.

## Appendix 1

Let us suppose that the axes crossing angle differs from the right one by a small angle \(\zeta\) ( see Fig. 8 ). After the adjustment the X- ray beam direction coincides with the BDD polar axis. A cone surface equation in the X', Y, Z' co-ordinate system, where Z' is a normal to the elevation axis, is the following:

\[y^{2}+z^{*2}-x^{*2}\cot^{2}\zeta=0\]

After co-ordinate transformation into X, Y,Z - system and substitution the projection plane equation \(z=d\), one obtains a hyperbola equation:

\[x=\tan 2\zeta\ d/2\ [(\ 1+y^{2}/d^{2}\cos 2\zeta\cos{{}^{2}\zeta}\ )^{1/2}-1\ ],\ \ \text{and as}\ \zeta<<1\ \text{so}\]

\[x\equiv\zeta\ d\ [(1+y^{2}/d^{2}\ )^{1/2}-1],\ \ \ \text{and in}\ \Phi\ \text{angle units}\]\[\phi\equiv\zeta\;{\rm d}\;/\;(\;{\rm d}^{2}+y^{2}\;)^{1/2}\;[(\;1+y^{2}/\;{\rm d}^{ 2}\;)^{1/2}-1\;]=\zeta\;[1-1/(\;1+y^{2}/{\rm d}^{2}\;)^{1/2}].\]
