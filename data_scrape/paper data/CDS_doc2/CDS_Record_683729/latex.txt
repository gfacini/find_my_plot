Irradiation of the MDT tubes and sputtering for reanimation or tube cleaning may cause aluminium, sputtered from the cathode surface, to settle on the insulating surfaces of the end plugs, thus making them conductive to a certain level. In the presence of high electrical fields this may lead to an increased leakage current and spurious pulses through discharges.

In order to verify that this does not jeopardize the operation of the tubes, currents have been measured on 48 3.8 m long tubes of the "Merlin" chamber [1] which were operated with Ar/CH\({}_{4}\)/N\({}_{2}\)/CO\({}_{2}\) (94%/3%/2%/1%)+1200 ppm H\({}_{2}\)O at 3 bar in the X5 irradiation facility at CERN for several weeks. 17 tubes were collecting about 140 mC/cm in two runs, the remaining 31 tubes collected about 70 mC/cm in one run. All tubes of the 140 mC/cm sample and 21 tubes of the 70 mC/cm sample were sputtered as described below in order to reanimate the 17 tubes from the first run and to clean the cathodes of the new tubes before their first run.

The sputtering was done the following way: the parameters for the first run (see Table 1) were fixed following the experience from successful reanimation in 30 cm long single tubes in Freiburg [2].

The total integrated charge in this run was 1660 mC/cm. Since the reanimation of the 17 inefficient tubes failed and the sputtering of the 21 other tubes lead to deposits on the wire of the new tubes a second run with an argon/oxygen mixture was carried out. The total integrated charge was about 680 mC/cm. The second run accomplished a complete reanimation of the previously inefficient tubes and also repaired the damaged new tubes except for distinct local inefficiencies.

However, one of the new tubes was left with a high counting rate which did not vanish during the aging run. A recent current measurement for single tubes showed that this tube drew a current of 270 nA, while all other 47 tubes drew less than 15 nA. The Ohmic resistance was larger than 1 G\(\Omega\) in all cases measured. Note, however, that the critical tube was not accessible for the resistance measurement. Currently this tube is sputtered again in Ar/O\({}_{2}\) to check if the noise can be cured (compare to the other test described below).

A detailed analysis of the inner plastic surface of one of the end plugs is presently being performed at CERN using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The first results are compatible with the expected atomic composition of the material (Noryl): only carbon and oxygen are present in significant quantities, aluminium is absent at levels beyond 1% of an atomic layer. A few peaks with intensities close to the detection limit still need to be identified [4].
