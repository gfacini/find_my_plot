###### Abstract

The present note presents studies of the decay channel \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}l^{+}l^{-}\) through a virtual Z\({}^{*}\) at point 4 of mSUGRA. Two versions of PYTHIA were compared by studying the differences in the invariant mass distributions of opposite-sign same-flavour lepton pairs. The newest version of the two, includes the spin-averaged matrix element in sparticle decays, thus taking into account the spin of the neutralinos and the propagator. The effect of this inclusion is profound. This note shows that the dilepton mass can be used to distinguish the three body matrix element decay from a pure phase space one.

## 1. Introduction

The Standard Model (SM) [1] describes successfully the fundamental interactions (electromagnetic, weak and strong) of elementary particles at the smallest scales and highest energies accessible to current experiments. Nevertheless, it cannot be considered to be the ultimate theory of Nature because it can not provide answers to many questions. The SM is a work in progress and will have to be extended to describe physics at arbitrarily high energies. A very motivated extension of the Standard Model is Supersymmetry (SUSY) [2]. SUSY is a generalization of the space-time symmetries of quantum field theory that transforms fermions into bosons and vice versa. That is, every known elementary particle has a supersymmetric partner, or superpartner, which is like it in all respects except for its spin. Spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) fermions, leptons and quarks have spin-0 superpartners, while spin-1 bosons, like the photon, have spin-\(\frac{1}{2}\) superpartners.

SUSY must of course be broken, since superpartners have not been observed. But SUSY particles, if they exist, should be observable in the next generation of accelerators, since their mass estimates, are in the TeV region. In the general MSSM, supersymmetry breaking is accomplished by hand, that is by including in the Lagrangian the most general renormalizable soft-supersymmetry breaking terms consistent with the \(SU(3)\times SU(2)\times U(1)\) gauge symmetry and R-Parity invariance. These soft terms are mass terms of all superpartners and Higgs-squark-squark and Higgs-slepton-slepton trilinear interaction terms (these are the so-called 'A parameters'). This effect results in the introduction of many new free parameters which actually parametrize our ignorance of the fundamental mechanism of supersymmetry breaking. There are a total of 105 new parameters in addition to the SM ones, thus the total number of truly independent parameters that the MSSM possesses is 124. Electroweak symmetry can not be broken by hand in a similar way, since this would destroy gauge invariance. In the SM masses can be introduced only by spontaneous symmetry breaking using the Higgs mechanism.

The addition of so many new parameters in the MSSM Langragian mentioned above, can not be arbitrary. For a better and more complete understanding of this, it is necessary to consider models in which SUSY is spontaneously broken and then it is transmitted to the MSSM by some mechanism.

Since none of the fields of the MSSM can develop non zero vacuum expectation value to break SUSY without spoiling the gauge invariance, it is supposed that spontaneous supersymmetry breaking takes place via some other fields. According to the most common scenario for producing low energy supersymmetry breaking, there exist two sectors: a 'hidden' sector consisting of particles, which lead to breaking of SUSY and are completely neutral with respect to the SM gauge group, and a 'visible' sector consisting of the particles of the MSSM. SUSY breaking is assumed to occur in the hidden sector and as these two sectors interact with each other by exchange of some fields called messengers, the SUSY breaking is mediated from the hidden to the visible sector. There might be various types of messengers fields: gravity, gauge, etc. Therefore there exist different scenarios of SUSY breaking. The scenario where the messsenger is gravity is called Minimal Supergravity Model (mSUGRA) [3].

Once SUSY and electroweak symmetry are broken, particles with the same quantum numbers will in general mix. Gauginos (winos and bino) and Higgsinos mix to form:

* two pairs of charged spin-1/2 particles, the charginos \(\tilde{\chi_{i}}^{\pm}\) (i = 1, 2)
* four neutral spin-1/2 particles, the neutralinos \(\tilde{\chi_{i}}^{0}\) (i = 1, 2, 3, 4)1

Footnote 1: The numbering of the \(\tilde{\chi_{i}}^{0}\) is ascending with their mass.

In the mSUGRA approach, the MSSM-124 parameter freedom is sharply reduced to 23: 18 of them (excluding the Higgs mass) are the Standard Model parameters and the remaining five are the following:

* \(m_{0}\) the common scalar mass,
* \(m_{1/2}\) the common gauginos and Higgsinos mass,
* \(A_{0}\) the trilinear Higgs-sfermion-sfermion couplings,
* \(tan\beta\) the ratio of the two Higgs vacuum expectation values,
* \(sign(\mu)\) the sign of the Higgsino mass parameter.

The masses of the two lightest neutralinos and the lightest chargino are determined by the \(m_{1/2}\). The slepton masses are determined by \(m_{0}\) and \(m_{1/2}\). Within mSUGRA the following relations are valid [4]:

\[M_{\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}}\approx M_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}}\approx 2M_{\tilde{ \chi}_{1}^{0}}\approx(0.25-0.35)M_{\tilde{g}}\approx 0.9\ m_{1/2} \tag{1}\]

\[M_{\tilde{l}_{L}}^{2}=m_{0}^{2}+0.52\ m_{1/2}^{2}-0.5(1-2{\rm sin}^{2}\theta_{ \rm W})\ {\rm m_{Z}^{2}}\ \cos 2\beta \tag{2}\]

\[M_{\tilde{l}_{R}}^{2}=m_{0}^{2}+0.15\ m_{1/2}^{2}-{\rm sin}^{2}\theta_{\rm W} \ {\rm m_{Z}^{2}}\ \cos 2\beta \tag{3}\]

where \(M\) denotes the mass of the corresponding particle which is indicated as an index.

The masses, mixings and decays of all SUSY and Higgs particles are determined in terms of the five mSUGRA parameters mentioned above. The LHC Committee (LHCC) selected five mSUGRA parameter space points in 1996 for detailed study by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations. The parameters of the five LHCC points are listed in Table 1.

SUGRA phenomenology for \(tan\beta\geq 10\) is more complicated because of the need to include additional Yukawa couplings and mixings in the \(\tilde{5}\) and \(\tilde{\tau}\) sectors. For this technical reason the five LHCC mSUGRA points were selected to have \(tan\beta\leq 10\). There is, however, no reason to disfavour larger values of \(tan\beta\). Therefore, a sixth point with large \(tan\beta\) was added later by the ATLAS experiment for detailed studies. This point was selected so that the only two-body gaugino decays are \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{\tau}_{1}\tau\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\rightarrow\tilde{\tau}_{1}\nu\); these decays therefore dominate and give signatures involving \(\tau\)'s.

The study presented here has been carried out at Point 4 of mSUGRA as well as at some points around it. Point 4 was chosen to be near the boundary for electroweak symmetry breaking, implying that \(\mu\) is small so that there is quite strong mixing between gauginos and Higgsinos. This boundary turns out to be quite sensitive to the details of how electroweak symmetry breaking is implemented. At point 4 the gluino is relatively light (small gaugino mass \(m_{1/2}\)) and the total SUSY cross-section is \(\simeq 32\) pb. Furthermore squarks and sleptons are heavy (large scalar mass \(m_{0}\)) at point 4. As a consequence, the second neutralino (\(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\)) has a three body decay through a virtual \(Z^{*}\) (\(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to Z^{*}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0 }l^{+}l^{-}\)).

A study of this decay channel and and its potential SUSY and SM backgrounds is presented here. Two versions of the Monte Carlo generator PYTHIA were used: PYTHIA 6.158 and PYTHIA 6.160. The main difference between the two versions is that although in 6.158 the decays of sparticles are purely phase space treated, in 6.160 the spin-averaged matrix element is included in these decays.

The generated events were passed through the standard fast simulation of the ATLAS Collaboration, ATLFAST. For an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), we reconstructed the invariant mass of opposite-sign same-flavour (OS-SF) lepton pairs at point 4, as well as at three other points of the \((m_{0},m_{1/2})\) space (where the mass difference between the two lightest neutralinos is the same as at point 4, \(M_{l^{+}l^{-}}^{max}=M_{\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}}-M_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\simeq 72\) GeV). The same procedure was followed for a few more points of the mSUGRA parameter space where we changed also the \(tan\beta\) and the \(sign(\mu)\). After applying stringent selection criteria in the distributions obtained, we compared the two models as it will be described in the next section.

## 2 Neutralino decay studies in mSUGRA

The Monte Carlo generators used for the study presented here was PYTHIA 6.158 and PYTHIA 6.160. The supersymmetric extension of PYTHIA, which is called SPYTHIA [5] and can simulate particle production and decay in mSUGRA (approximately), is implemented already in the above mentioned versions of PYTHIA.

The weak point of the version 6.158 (and of course of all the older ones), arises from the pure phase-space treatment of SUSY particle decays and from not accounting for spin correlations, neither at production not for decays. It is assumed that the matrix element for these decays is relatively flat in phase space, and could thus be treated as a constant. In July 2001, the version 6.160 was released. The spin-averaged matrix element is now included in the decays of SUSY particles, thus taking into account the spin of the neutralinos, as well as the propagator in three-body decays. A number of approximations were although made. The decay chain is really treated in independent steps, instead of including the possibility of correlations. For example, in the decay of the gluino (\(\tilde{\rm g}\to{\rm q}\tilde{\rm q}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\)), gluino spins are averaged over; so, if there was any polarization in the production process, it is ignored. Next, the \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) spins are summed over, so again, any polarization of the \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) is lost in this summation. Finally, when the \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) is decayed (\(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}{}^{\dagger}{}^{\dagger}{}^{-}\)), the \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) spins are averaged over, and the \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) spins are summed [6].

In the present note, the first studies for the second neutralino decay at point 4 of mSUGRA using the improved code of PYTHIA (PYTHIA 6.160) are presented. A comparison between the results of the two versions of PYTHIA is made offering the possibility of distinguishing between a spin-averaged matrix neutralino decay and a pure phase space one.

### 2.1 Main Characteristics of the fourth point

The point 4 is characterised by the following values of the parameters in the 5-dimensional mSUGRA space:

\(m_{0}\) = 800 GeV

\(m_{1/2}\) = 200 GeV

\(A_{0}\) = 0

\(tan\beta\) = 10

\(sign(\mu)\) = +

The particle mass spectrum for this specific point is given in Table 2. Among the SUSY processes, which have large cross-sections at Point 4 at the LHC, gluino pair production dominates (since the gluino is light) followed by \(\tilde{\rm q}\tilde{\rm g}\) production. Since the squarks are heavy in this point, \(\tilde{\rm q}\tilde{\rm q}\) production has a much smaller cross-section (Table 3). Figure 1 shows processes ofgluon fusion, quark-antiquark and quark-gluon scattering that produce gg and qg.

At point 4 the gluino mass is smaller than the squark mass, therefore the gluino can not decay to qq pairs as it does at the other four mSUGRA points. Instead, it undergoes three-body decays into a qq pair plus a gaugino (see Table 4).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(\mathrm{Gluino}\) & \(\mathrm{Decay}\) channel & BR (\%) \\ \hline \(\tilde{g}\rightarrow\) & \(q\overline{q}^{\prime}\chi^{\pm}_{1}\) & 51.18 \\ \hline  & \(q\overline{\tilde{\chi}}^{0}_{2}\) & 31.23 \\ \hline  & \(q\overline{\tilde{\chi}}^{0}_{1}\) & 17.32 \\ \hline  & \(q\overline{q}^{\prime}\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{2}\) & 0.12 \\ \hline  & \(q\overline{\tilde{\chi}}^{0}_{4}\) & 0.12 \\ \hline  & \(q\overline{\tilde{\chi}}^{0}_{3}\) & 0.01 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 3: _Production cross-sections for some main SUSY processes at Point 4, as given by PYTHIA 6.160._At point 4 leptons are mainly produced in the chargino and neutralino decays shown in Table 5. The light charginos and neutralinos have no two-body decays at this mSUGRA point. The second neutralino decays into the first neutralino and two leptons in a three-body decay that occurs through a virtual \(\mathrm{Z}^{*}\). The branching ratio of this decay, considering only electrons and muons, is about 5%. The study of this decay channel is the subject of the following sections.

### 2.2 Dilepton invariant mass distribution

The three-body decay of the next-to lightest neutralino (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\)) gives an interesting signature for point 4, which should allow not only the observation of a SUSY signal, but also the measurement of some parameters of the theory such as the mass difference between the second lightest and the lightest neutralino. The relevant Feynman diagram is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 1: _Processes responsible for gluino pair production as well as for squark-gluino production at LHC._

For our studies, SUSY signal events for point 4 were generated using PYTHIA 6.158 and PYTHIA 6.160. All SUSY processes were switched on at the same time (MSEL=39 in SPYTHIA). The total number of events produced for each version of PYTHIA was 3 \(\cdot 10^{5}\). Subsequently, these produced events were passed through the standard fast detector simulation and physics analysis program ATLFAST [7].

The main potential Standard Model backgrounds are \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) production, W and Z pair production (WW, ZZ), Z +jets, W + jets and finally WZ. We produced \(2\cdot 10^{6}\) tt events (\(\sigma=399\) pb) and \(8\cdot 10^{5}\) events of the remaining processes (\(\sigma=2300\) pb). These events were also processed through ATLFAST. A cut of \(p_{T}>\)100 GeV of the hard-scattering process was applied at the generation level.

Features discriminating SUSY events from SM processes are the large transverse missing energy, due to the presence of two \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)s in the final state, and large multiplicity of high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) jets and/or leptons, since the produced sparticles are usually heavy and decay through cascade decays. Therefore, in order to select a clean SUSY sample and eliminate as much as possible the SM background, the following selection criteria are applied [8]:

* Two opposite-sign same-flavour (OS-SF) isolated2 leptons (electrons or muons) are required. Footnote 2: A lepton is labelled as ‘isolated’ if the transverse energy contained in a cone of size \(\Delta\mathrm{R}=\sqrt{\Delta^{2}\eta+\Delta^{2}\phi}=0.2\) around the lepton direction is smaller than 10 GeV and the lepton is seperated from calorimeter clusters by \(\Delta\mathrm{R}>0.4\).
* The most energetic lepton of the two should have a transverse momentum \(p_{T,1}>20\) GeV while the less energetic should have \(p_{T,2}>10\) GeV. Both should have pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\).
* The missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}\) in our events should be \(E_{T}^{miss}>200\) GeV to account for the lightest neutralinos \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) escaping the detector.

Figure 2: _The second neutralino decay through a virtual \(\mathrm{Z^{*}}\) at point 4 (\(l^{+},l^{-}=\) leptons)._

* At least four jets with transverse momenta \(p_{T}>100\), 55, 55 and 55 GeV respectively and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<3.2\) are required to account for gluino pair production as primary production mechanism.

After selecting the opposite-sign same-flavour leptons, which satisfy the above selection cuts, we reconstructed their invariant mass. This dilepton mass distribution was then normalised for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (three years of LHC running at low luminosity). The dominant remaining SM background is from \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production and it was also normalised for the same integrated luminosity as the SUSY reconstructed events. The other SM backgrounds (WW, WZ, ZZ, Z+jets and W+jets) are completely suppressed by the jet multiplicity cut and the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) cut. Figure 3 shows the dilepton mass distribution for both versions of PYTHIA used. In both cases around 6500 SUSY events (OS-SF) remain while the SM \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background is reduced to only 250 events. The main background left comes from other SUSY processes e.g. chargino decays (SUSY background).

An excess of dileptons with the specific shape of the dilepton mass spectrum shown in this Figure, can be used as evidence for discovery of SUSY through \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) production. The endpoint of the distribution measures the mass difference between the second lightest and the lightest neutralino [9]\(M_{l^{+}l^{-}}^{max}=M_{\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}}-M_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\simeq 72\) GeV (same for both versions). It is obvious that the inclusion of the spin-averaged matrix element in the second neutralino decay modifies the shape of the dilepton mass spectrum (Figure 3b), which peaks close to the endpoint, indicating more apparently that the decay takes place through a virtual Z and not an slepton (which is heavy at this mSUGRA point anyway).

In both Figures the SUSY background consisting of opposite-sign same-flavour lepton pairs is also indicated (grey histogram). The dashed histogram represents the combinatorial background consisting of opposite-sign opposite-flavour lepton pairs._

It should be pointed out that the dilepton mass distribution of PYHTIA 6.158 (Figure 3a), differs a bit from the one presented at the [9] and [8]. The main difference is the absence of a peak at around 90 GeV in our results. This structure concentrated around the Z mass, while using older versions of PYTHIA, indicated the production of Z bosons in SUSY cascade decays. This Z peak was mainly due to the production of the second chargino \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{\pm}\) in the gluino decay (\(\tilde{\rm g}\to{\rm q}\bar{q}^{\prime}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{\pm}\)) with a branching ratio of 6%, followed by the decay \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{\pm}\to{\rm Z}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\). In the versions of PYTHIA that we used in the present study, the branching ratio for this gluino decay is only 0.12%, thus the Z peak almost vanishes.

The combinatorial background contribution from other SUSY processes can be estimated by using a sample of events selected with the same cuts as already described earlier in this section, except that the two leptons are required to have opposite sign and opposite flavour (OS-OF), i.e. \({\rm e}^{+}\mu^{-}\) or \({\rm e}^{-}\mu^{+}\). About 3300 such events are expected from SUSY production at Point 4 for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). Figure 3 shows the dilepton invariant mass distribution for the OS-OF SUSY sample (both PYTHIA versions), superimposed to the OS-SF SUSY and background distributions. The distribution of this combinatorial background is very similar to the SUSY background given by the simulation and is therefore a powerful tool to estimate the SUSY background in real conditions at LHC.

A more quantitative comparison between the invariant mass spectra of the two PYTHIA versions is made by fitting the two distributions with the same function and compare its parameters. After several attempts, we obtained the following fitting function:

\[F(x)=p_{1}\cdot e^{\frac{(x-p_{2})}{p_{3}}-e^{\frac{x-p_{2}}{p_{3}}}{p_{3}}}+P \tag{4}\]

where \(p_{i}\) (\(i=\) 1,2,3) are the parameters determined by the fit, while \(P\) is a fixed polynomial of 6th degree that fits the combinatorial distribution determined from the OS-OF sample and is treated as a constant in the fit using the function \({\rm F}(x)\). The parameter \(p_{1}\) serves as a normalisation parameter for the size of the distribution, the \(p_{2}\) is the peak position and finally \(p_{3}\) characterizes the width of the distribution. The result obtained after we performed the fit on the dilepton mass distributions shown in Figure 3, is presented in Figure 4.

It is obvious, as indicated also by the values of the parameter \(p_{3}\), that the mass distribution where only the phase space neutralino decay is taken into account, has a larger width than the distribution where the spin-averaged matrix element is included in the sparticles decays (\(p_{3}\approx 14\) and \(\approx 8\) GeV for PYTHIA versions 6.158 and 6.160 respectively). The peak of the distribution for PYTHIA 6.160 is shifted to higher energies and is expressed by the value of the parameter \(p_{2}\approx 62\) GeV, while for PYTHIA 6.158 is \(p_{2}\approx 52\) GeV. Therefore at Point 4 the effects of the matrix element inclusion are profound.

### 2.3 Modifying the parameters of mSUGRA

#### Changing the \(\bf{m_{0}}\) and \(\bf{m_{1/2}}\)

Our purpose is to study the change of the shape of the dilepton mass distribution and not of the endpoint position (as already studied in [8]) of the decay \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}l^{+}l^{-}\) in different points of the mSUGRA parameter space, starting from the point 4. Therefore we selected those points of the parameter space where the mass difference between the next-to lightest and the lightest neutralino is that of Point 4 (\(M_{\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}}-M_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\approx 72\) GeV). In points where this requirement is not fulfilled, the position of the endpoint of the invariant mass distribution of the OS-SF lepton pairs would change. We scanned the \(m_{0},m_{1/2}\) space only, while keeping the values of the \(tan\beta\), the \(sign(\mu)\) and the \(A_{0}\) the same as in Point 4. Some of the points where \(M_{\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}}-M_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\approx 72\) GeV, are shown in Figure 5. The parameter \(m_{1/2}\) is almost completely responsible for determining the gluino mass, as well as the masses of the two lightest neutralinos (see equation 1). Therefore the mass difference between \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) is not very sensitive to the change of the parameter \(m_{0}\).

Figure 4: _The dilepton invariant mass distributions of Figure 3 fitted with the function (4) for (a) PYTHIA 6.158 and (b) PYTHIA 6.160. The fitted function is plotted as a solid line in the mass region used in the fit._It is important to mention that the scan of the parameter space was made for values of \(m_{0}<800\) GeV and \(m_{1/2}>200\) GeV. For the region around Point 4, values of \(m_{0}>800\) GeV and \(m_{1/2}<200\) are excluded either by theory or experiment. From the points presented in the above Figure, we selected the ones listed in Table 6. We named them as A, B, C and D for quick reference.

For each of these scan points we reconstructed for both versions of PYTHIA (6.158 and 6.160), the invariant mass distribution of opposite-sign same-flavour lepton pairs and applied the same selection cuts as described in the previous section. The dilepton mass spectra obtained for points A, B and C are presented in Figures 6, 7 and 8 respectively. The combinatorial background coming from other SUSY processes is also plotted. For point D, the branching ration for the decay \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}l^{+}l^{-}\) is negligible, so this channel is almost closed and practically no signal events were observed.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Point & \(m_{0}\) & \(m_{1/2}\) \\ \hline A & 600 & 205.5 \\ \hline B & 400 & 210.5 \\ \hline C & 200 & 213.5 \\ \hline D & 25 & 215.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 7: Same as in Figure 6 but for point B.

In order to quantitatively distinguish between the two PYTHIA versions for each scan point, we fitted the mass distributions with the function (4). The fitted curve is shown in the Figures 9, 10 and 11 for the points A, B and C respectively. The values of the parameters \(p_{2}\) and \(p_{3}\) that were obtained from the fit, as well as the number of OS-SF SUSY events in each distribution, are summarized in Table 7.

Figure 8: Same as in Figure 6 but for point C.

Figure 10: _Point B: The dilepton invariant mass distributions of Figure 7 fitted with the function (4) for (a) PYTHIA 6.158 and (b) PYTHIA 6.160._

It is obvious that for points A and B, the two versions of PYTHIA can be distinguished. The effect of the spin-averaged matrix element is profound, as the mass distribution obtained using the newer version, is still steeper close to the endpoint position and its width is smaller than the one resulting from the use of the older version. The shape of the invariant mass distribution for signal events, is not very sensitive to the change of the parameter \(m_{0}\); for the wide range of \(m_{0}=800\) GeV till \(m_{0}\sim 400\) GeV the shape is very similar. In this range it is therefore possible to test whether the \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) three body decay is described by the SUSY matrix element without a precise knowledge of \(m_{0}\). At point C, the distributions for both versions of PYTHIA become quite similar. The number of OS-SF events for both versions stays quite the same.

A noticeable difference between the invariant mass spectra for different values of \(m_{0}\), is the appearance of a peak around 90 GeV (see points B and C).

At point B, the Z peak is mainly due to the production of the second chargino \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{-}\) in the decay \(\tilde{b}_{1}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{-}\)t with a branching ratio of 17%. At this mSUGRA point the squarks have smaller masses (\(\sim 600\) GeV) than those at Point 4 so the \(\tilde{\rm qg}\) production dominates. The SUSY cross-section is larger (63.34 pb). Moreover, the gluino decays mainly as \(\tilde{\rm g}\rightarrow\tilde{b}_{1}\tilde{b}\), \(\tilde{\tilde{b}}_{1}\tilde{b}\) (78% branching ratio). Such a decay mode of the gluino at Point 4 is impossible due to the fact that \(\tilde{b}_{1}\) is heavier there.

At point C, the \(\tilde{\rm qg}\) production again dominates. The gluino does not have three body decays at this point; instead, it decays mainly to \(\tilde{\rm qg}\). Subsequently the squarks decay producing neutralinos and charginos. The Z peak at this point comes from the decays of these charginos. The SUSY cross section is even larger here (94.3 pb). Although at points B and C the Z peak is quite high, it still does not obscure the mass distributions for \(<72\) GeV that we are interested in.

As we move from point 4 towards point C, the masses of the sleptons (squarks) decrease from \(\sim\)800 GeV (\(\sim 900\) GeV) down to \(\sim\)250 GeV (\(\sim\)500 GeV).

### Changing the \(tan\beta\) and \(sign(\mu)\)

A supplementary step in our studies was to explore the potential use of the channel \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}l^{+}l^{-}\) in more regions of the mSUGRA parameter space where except from the \(m_{0}\) and \(m_{1/2}\) parameters, the value of \(tan\beta\) and the \(sign(\mu)\) were changed. Therefore we considered two more cases where first the \(sign(\mu)\) was taken negative (while the remaining mSUGRA parameters were the same as the ones at point 4) and secondly the value of the \(tan\beta\) assumed to be equal to 2 (\(\mu>0\)). For these two cases, as well as for the case where \(tan\beta=10\) and \(sign(\mu)>0\) (as they are point 4), we first calculated the branching ratio of our decay channel while scanning the parameter space of \((m_{0},m_{1/2})\) (Figure 12).

In the following part of this section, studies in a few selected points with different values of mSUGRA parameters are presented.

The dilepton mass distribution of opposite-sign same-flavour lepton pairs for the point

\[m_{0}=800\,\,\,{\rm GeV}\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,m_{1/2}=200\,\,\,{\rm GeV}\,\,\,\,\, \,\,\,\,A_{0}=0\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,tan\beta=10\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\mu<0\]

called for simplicity in this analysis, point'minus', is shown in Figure 13. The same distribution but fitted with the function (4) is presented in Figure 14. It should be pointed out that this point differs from this of point 4 only by the \(sign(\mu)\).

The number of OS-SF SUSY events expected are about 6700 for both versions of PYTHIA and for an integrated luminosity of 3 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The already well known effect of the spin-averaged matrix element is again visible in these Figures. The mass distribution in Figure 13b is very similar to the one of point 4, as even the position of the endpoint does not change. At point'minus', the mass difference between the next-to lightest and the lightest neutralino is still \(\approx\) 72 GeV. The SUSY cross section for this point is quite the same with the one at point 4 (\(\sim\) 32 pb).

In both Figures again, the SUSY background consisting of opposite-sign same-flavour lepton pairs is indicated (grey histogram)._

Another point similar to that of point 4 but differing only in the \(tan\beta\) value is the following:

\[m_{0}=800\ \mbox{GeV}\ \ \ \ m_{1/2}=200\ \mbox{GeV}\ \ \ \ A_{0}=0\ \ \ \ tan\beta=2\ \ \ \ \mu>0\]

At this point though the branching ratio for the decay \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}l^{+}l^{-}\) is negligible (as can be seen also in Figure 12c). No dilepton mass distribution of OS-SF lepton pairs containing a sufficient number of pure signal events could be reconstructed. Therefore, in order to study the three body \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) decay for \(tan\beta=2\) we used the following parameters:

\[m_{0}=300\ \mbox{GeV}\ \ \ \ m_{1/2}=200\ \mbox{GeV}\ \ \ \ A_{0}=0\ \ \ \ tan\beta=2\ \ \ \ \mu>0\]

The results are shown in Figures 15 and 16 and they are quite similar for both versions of PYTHIA. The number of expected OS-SF SUSY events is \(\sim 15000\) (integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\ \mbox{pb}^{-1}\)). The SUSY cross section is about three times larger than the one at point 4 (\(\sim 104\ \mbox{pb}\)), \(\tilde{q}\tilde{g}\) production dominates, while the mass of the sleptons is about 300 GeV.

## 3. Conclusions

At point 4 of the mSUGRA parameter space, the next-to lightest neutralino (\(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\)) has three body decay (\(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}l^{+}l^{-}\)). This decay, gives an interesting signature for point 4, which should allow not only the observation of a SUSY signal, but also the measurement of some parameters of the theory such as the mass difference between the second lightest and the lightest neutralino. Since the sleptons are heavy at this point of mSUGRA, the decay of the \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) occurs through a virtual Z\({}^{*}\) with a branching ratio of 5%.

For our studies, SUSY signal events for point 4 were generated using two versions of the Monte Carlo generator PYTHIA (namely PYTHIA 6.158 and 6.160). The supersymmetric extension of PYTHIA (SPYTHIA) that can simulate particle production and decay in mSUGRA (approximately), is implemented already in the above mentioned versions of PYTHIA. In version 6.158, the decays of the sparticles are purely phase space treated, while in the version 6.160 the spin-averaged matrix element is included in these decays, thus taking into account the spin of the neutralinos, as well as the propagator (Z*). Subsequently these produced events passed through the standard fast detector simulation and physics analysis program ATLFAST.

The invariant mass of opposite-sign same-flavour lepton pairs was reconstructed at point 4. These events are required to fulfill stringent transverse missing energy and large jet multiplicity selection criteria in order to suppress the SM background. The specific shape of this dilepton mass distribution can be used as evidence for discovery of SUSY through \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) production. A comparison between the results of the two versions of PYTHIA not only at point 4 but also at other points of the mSUGRA parameter space, showed that for values of \(m_{0}\) between 800-400 GeV it is possible to distinguish between a phase space decay and a spin-averaged matrix element neutralino decay, even without the exact knowledge of the value of \(m_{0}\). The channel \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}l^{+}l^{-}\) can be successfully used for SUSY studies in large regions of the parameter space.
