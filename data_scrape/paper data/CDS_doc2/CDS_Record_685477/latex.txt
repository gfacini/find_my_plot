LHC Parton Kinematics

= Essentially all physics at LHC are connected to the interactions of quarks and gluons (small & large transferred momentum).

= This requires a solid understanding of QCD.

= Accurate measurements of SM cross sections at the LHC will further constrain the pdf's.

= The kinematic acceptance of the LHC detectors allows a large range of \(\mathbf{x}\) and \(\mathbf{Q}^{2}\) to be probed ( LHC coverage: \(|y|<5\) ).

Multiple parton interactions (MPI)

AFS, UA2 and more recently (and crucially!) CDF, have measured double parton interactions.

\(\sigma_{D}\left(p_{T}{}^{cut}\right)\)\(=m\)\(\sigma_{A}\sigma_{B}\)\(2\sigma_{eff}\)\(\sigma_{eff}\)\(\sigma_{eff}=14.5\pm 1.7\) mb

\(\sigma_{D}\) decreases as \(\rho_{T}\rightarrow\infty\) and grows

\(\sigma_{D}\) increases faster with \(\mathbf{s}\) as compared to \(\sigma_{S}\).

Multiple parton collisions are enhanced at

the LHC!

Source of background:

\(>\) WH+X\(\rightarrow\) (\(N\)) b\(\bar{5}\)+X,

\(>\) Zb\(\bar{5}\rightarrow\) (\(N\)) b\(\bar{5}\)+X,

\(>\) W + jets, Wb + jets and Wb\(\bar{5}\) + jets,

\(>\) t\(\bar{t}\rightarrow\)\(Ilb\bar{b}\),

final states with many jets \(\rho_{T}{}^{\min}\)\(\sim\) 20 - 30 GeV.

QCD physics at ATLASMinimum-bias and the underlying event

Minimum bias events

Experimental definition: depends on the

experiment trigger! "Minimum bias" is usually

associated to non-single diffractive events

(NSD), e.g. ISR, UAS, E735, CDF.

In a hard scattering process, the underlying event has a hard component (initial + final-state radiation and particles from the outgoing hard scattered partons) and a soft component (beam-beam remnants).

Conclusions:

* LHC will probe QCD to unexplored kinematic limits;
* Jet studies (test of pQCD, constrain p.d.f.'s, physics studies);
* Luminosity uncertainties can be reduced by measurements of relative luminosities: high-Q\({}^{2}\) and wide x-range;
* Prompt-photon production will lead to improved knowledge of background levels (H\(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma\gamma\)), f\({}_{\rm g}\)(x) and parton dynamics;
* \(a_{\rm s}\) at high-energy scales (test of the running of \(a_{\rm s}\));
* Multiple parton scattering: source of background and/or new physics channels;
* Minimum-bias and the underlying event: improved understanding of events dominated by soft processes.
