In this note we discuss algorithm for reconstruction and identification of true and fake hadronic \(\tau\)'s. Track-based approach is proposed to define a seed of reconstructed objects and energy-flow is used to define its energy scale. The single-prong and three-prong modes are discussed separately.

Results are presented for the \(q\overline{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\), \(q\overline{q}\to W\to\tau\nu\) and \(gg,gq,q\overline{q}\to gg,gq,q\overline{q}\) events from DC1 data samples. It is shown, that proposed algorithm leads to very clean signal samples of low background for reconstructed candidates. Background suppression of identification selection is then rather moderate.

Discussion is limited to the barrel region (\(|\eta|<1.5\)) and is based on the DC1 events simulated without pile-up and electronic noise.

Introduction

Identification of hadronic \(\tau\) decays will be the key to the possible Higgs boson discovery in the wide range of the MSSM parameter space [1]. The \(h/H/A\to\tau\tau\) and \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) are promising channels in the mass range spanning from roughly 100 GeV to 800 GeV. The sensitivity increases with large \(\tan\beta\) and decreases with rising mass of the Higgs boson. The \(H\to\tau\tau\) decays will also give access to the Standard Model and light Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model Higgs boson observability around \(m_{H}=120\) GeV, produced by vector-boson fusion [2]. Needless to say that hadronic \(\tau\) identification is very important for searching for supersymmetric particles.

Hadronic \(\tau\) identification in ATLAS has been studied since several years as a key benchmark signature for optimising detector design and presently, to optimise the performance of the final reconstruction algorithms. Results have been reported on several occasions, the most recent references are [1], [3], [4] and [5]. Several details can be also found in earlier notes e.g. [6]. Presently, the _base-line_ algorithm in Athena reconstruction framework is tauRec package [7].

In this note we present further development of the algorithm for hadronic \(\tau\) reconstruction and identification proposed in [8]. The algorithm is intended for studies of a low mass Higgs, around 120 GeV, with visible energy from hadronic \(\tau\) decays in the range 20 - 70 GeV. Algorithm is designed to explore exclusive features of hadronic \(\tau\) decays: single-prong or three-prong signature; the presence of only charged hadronic energy (\(\pi^{\pm}\) or \(3\pi^{\pm}\)) and of only neutral pure electromagnetic energy (\(n\pi^{0}\)), both components being collimated in space. The energy flow [9, 10] is used to define energy scale of reconstructed candidates.

With respect to what discussed in [8], we have slightly modified algorithm for single-prong mode and completed it with the three-prongs mode. We have also implemented important modification to the energy flow approach for defining energy scale. In this note, we present complete results on reconstruction for single-prong and three prongs hadronic \(\tau\) decays of DC1 data [11]. In Section 2 we recall main features of the hadronic \(\tau\) decays, based on the _truth_ information from generation level. In Section 3 we give a detailed description of the algorithm for reconstruction and identification of single-prong and three-prongs decays. In Section 4 we present results on the performance for reconstructing true and fake hadronic \(\tau^{\prime}s\) from large samples of \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\), \(q\bar{q}\to W\to\tau\nu\) and QCD di-jet events. Separately discussed are single-prong and three-prongs modes, given are also estimates for the rejection performance for fake tau's originating from hard-process quarks or gluons. In Section 6 we draw some conclusions for the further development and optimisation of discussed algorithm.

Results are given for events simulated without electronic-noise and pile-up, in the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<1.5\). The algorithm exists presently as a private code working with the CBNT output of Athena in the ROOT tree format. In the appendixes we give some details on the ROOT classes of the algorithm and the parameters used. We also give details on the official ATLAS reconstruction code used in the presented studies, and on the analysed data samples.

Hadronic \(\tau\) decays

For the partonic level studies, events were generated using interface of PYTHIA and TAUOLA packages provided by the AcerMC-2.0 framework [12]. The generation correctly included full spin correlations in the \(\tau\) production and decays.

Table 1 shows branching ratios as presently implemented in the Tauola package [13], with form factors tuned by the CLEO collaboration and distributed with the environment [15].

For single-prong hadronic decays, the \(\tau\to\pi^{\pm}\nu\) mode contributes 23.4% and \(\tau\to n\pi^{0}\pi^{\pm}\nu\) mode remaining 76.6%. For three-prongs hadronic decays, the \(\tau\to 3\pi^{\pm}\nu\) decay contributes 64.6%, and \(\tau\to n\pi^{0}3\pi^{\pm}\nu\) mode only 25.6 %. The decay mode \(\tau\to K^{\pm}X\nu_{\tau}\), (\(\sim 3.8\) % of total) is less clear for classification between single-prong and three-prongs categories as it depends on the interaction with the detector. We will therefore omit this mode in the further discussion in this section. We can also safely neglect other multi-prongs hadronic modes.

Using dedicated partonic level sample of \(10^{5}\) events we have studied expected fraction of charged and neutral energy in the hadronic tau decays and a cone separation between decay products. Fig. 1 shows fraction of \(\sum\pi^{\pm}\) and \(\sum\pi^{0}\) energies with respect to the visible energy of the hadronic decay products of \(\tau\), \(E_{T}^{truth}\), for a single-prong (left) and three-prongs (right) decay modes, selected by requiring \(E_{T}^{truth}>20\) GeV and \(p_{Tmax}^{\pi^{\pm}}>10\) GeV. Asking for \(p_{Tmax}^{\pi^{\pm}}>10\) GeV is clearly enhancing fraction of charged energy in the selected hadronic \(\tau\). For single-prongs, on average, this fraction is 70% at \(E_{T}^{truth}=20\) GeV, decreasing to about 50% for larger values of \(E_{T}^{truth}\). For three-prongs, on average this fraction is about 80%-70%, and remains stable in the energy range \(E_{T}^{truth}=20-100\) GeV.

Fig. 2 shows cone separation \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) between \(\sum\pi^{\pm}\) and \(E_{T}^{truth}\) directions (calculated as energy weighted bary-center), for a single-prong and three-prongs decays. In case of the three-prongs decays shown is also cone separation of the most energetic \(\pi^{\pm}_{lead}\) and \(E_{T}^{truth}\) direction. Clearly, visible decay products of the \(\tau\) are close to each other. In case of single-prong decays, the mean distance between direction of the \(\pi^{\pm}\) and \(E_{T}^{truth}\) direction \(<\Delta R>\) is less than 0.02. In case of three-prongs decays, the mean distance of the bary-center of \(\sum\pi^{\pm}\)'s and \(E_{T}^{truth}\) direction \(<\Delta R>\) is less than 0.01, and is much smaller than the distance of the direction of leading \(\pi^{\pm}\) and \(E_{T}^{truth}\) direction.

## 3 Reconstruction of the hadronic \(\tau\)'s

Following approach proposed in [8], definition of the single-prong and three-prongs hadronic \(\tau\)-candidates is based on the presence of the qualified hadronic track(s) which will seed \(\tau\) reconstruction (see Section 3.1 for more details).

Reconstruction and identification of the \(\tau\)-candidates is based on the following steps:

* Identify and qualify a leading hadronic track;
* Create single-prong (\(\tau_{1P}\)) and three-prong (\(\tau_{3P}\)) candidates; Define (\(\eta,\ \phi\)) position of a seed and the energy scale of the candidate; Check charge consistency for three-prong candidates;

* Calculate calorimetric and energy-flow observables;
* Accept candidate as a hadronic \(\tau\) (single-prong or three-prongs).

Figure 2: _The cone separation between the most energetic \(\pi^{\pm}_{lead}\) and \(E_{T}^{truth}\) directions for a single-prongs (left) and three-prongs (middle), and between \(E_{T}^{truth}\) direction and energy weighted bary-center for three-prongs (right). Preselection of \(E_{T}^{truth}>20\) GeV and \(p_{T_{max}}^{\pi^{\pm}}>\) 10 GeV was applied._

The cone \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the seed is used as a _core_ of the reconstructed visible decay products of the \(\tau\), while region outside \(0.2<\Delta R<0.4\), is used to define isolation criteria. For a single-prong mode we require only one qualified hadronic track with no nearby tracks. For a three-prongs mode, exactly three nearby tracks are required, as the leading chosen is the most energetic one. The nearby tracks are searched for in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the seed, which is defined as track position at vertex (for a single-prong mode) or bary-center of the three tracks weighted with \(p_{T}^{track}\) (for three-prongs mode).

### The leading hadronic track

As already specified in [8], track is considered as a qualified one if it has passed some minimal criteria for a _good quality_ reconstruction. This means requiring a minimal number of hits in the silicon and straw detectors, a threshold on the value of the impact parameter as well as a threshold on the value of the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit for the trajectory reconstruction. The exact selection criteria are specified in Appendix B.1.

Fig. 3 shows efficiency, as a function of the track transverse momenta, for acceptance of a given track as a _qualified_ one. This efficiency is 80% at \(p_{T}>2\) GeV and 90% for \(p_{T}>10\) GeV in the \(|\eta|<1.5\) range.

We require also that the qualified track is not identified as an _electron_ or a _muon_ track. For the time being, this veto is based on the truth information only, because of the lack of the availability of the dedicated algorithms.

We have only roughly checked expected efficiency of using TR hits for identifying electron tracks. Fig. 4 shows the efficiency for labeling a track as an electron track by the requirement that the minimal number of TR hits is equal to 5. With this criterium alone, about 60%-70% of true electron tracks will be labeled as such, with about 2-3% loss of the true hadronic tracks. Results are shown for \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) sample, and electrons come mostly from leptonic decays of a second \(\tau\). This efficiency for electron track veto is certainly not sufficient and the dedicated algorithm for this purpose needs to be prepared.

The _qualified track_ is considered as a _leading track_ if its transverse momentum is above a given threshold \(p_{T}>10\) GeV, and if the number of nearby qualified tracks (in the cone

Figure 3: _The efficiency, as a function of track transverse momenta, for accepting a given track as a qualified one. Plot is shown for non-leptonic tracks only and \(|\eta|<1.5\)._

\(\Delta R<0.2\) and \(p_{T}>2\) GeV) is not greater than 2. Here, with respect to what in [8], we use smaller cone for searching for nearby tracks to the leading hadronic track.

Finally, we have checked that the asymmetry in the charge of the _qualified_ tracks distribution, measured from assigments of the charge by the reconstruction algorithm, is about 0.5% for \(p_{T}^{track}>10\) GeV (in this sample we expect no asymmetry from physics). Wrong assigment of the charge of the track will lead to some loss in the acceptance for three-prongs \(\tau\) decays.

### The \(\tau_{1P}\) and \(\tau_{3P}\) hadronic \(\tau\)'s

The single-prong hadronic \(\tau\) candidate, called \(\tau_{1P}\)-candidate, is seeded by the leading hadronic track, which has no nearby tracks (see previous section). No threshold is initially required on the accompanying calorimetric energy deposition in the cone around the track.

In Fig. 5 and 6, we show separation \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\,\phi^{2}}\) at the vertex between the visible \(\tau\) decay products direction (truth information) and the reconstructed track direction. The results are presented for the \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) sample and for \(\tau_{1P}\) candidates with \(E_{T}^{calo}>20\) GeV. One can conclude that the true direction of the visible \(\tau\) decay products is fairly well represented by the track \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) at the vertex. The track \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) at the vertex will therefore be used as the \(\tau_{1P}\) direction, as already discussed in [8].

The three-prongs hadronic \(\tau\) candidate, called \(\tau_{3P}\)-candidate, is seeded by the leading hadronic track, which has exactly two associated qualified nearby tracks (with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV). No threshold is initially required on the accompanying calorimetric energy deposition in the cone around the track. In Fig. 5 and 6, the middle plot shows the separation \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\,\phi^{2}}\) at the vertex between the visible \(\tau\) decay products direction (truth information) and the reconstructed direction of the leading track. The right plot shows the separation between the visible \(\tau\) decay products and direction of the bary-center (weighted with \(p_{T}^{track}\)) of the three tracks at vertex. Clearly, the bary-center reproduces much better the original direction of the visible decay products of the \(\tau\), therefore it will be used as the \(\tau_{3P}\) direction.

Table 2 summarises quality of the position reconstruction in \((\eta,\phi)\) coordinates for single-prong and three-prong decays. In the \(\Delta R(\tau^{reco},\tau^{truth})<0.025\) (size of a cell in the middle layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter) about 84% of reconstructed \(\tau_{1\tt p}\) and 98.1 % of reconstructed \(\tau_{3\tt p}\) is contained.

Error-bars denote RMS of the distributions. Results for \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) sample._

For \(\tau_{1P}\), reconstruction is unique, namely the same track cannot be used for reconstructing two different \(\tau_{1P}\) objects. For the \(\tau_{3P}\), the same track can be matched together with other two to form different groups of three nearby tracks. However, for the analysed sample of \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) events and true \(\tau_{3P}\) objects, the probability for not unique grouping turned out to be very small. In less than 1% of cases the same track was classified as _nearby_ track to two different leading tracks.

Requirements of the total charge measured from the invididual charge of the tracks to be \(\pm 1\), gives 97.4 % acceptance for the true \(\tau_{3P}\).

### The energy scale of \(\tau_{1P}\) and \(\tau_{3P}\)

The energy scale of the hadronic \(\tau\) candidate is defined using an _energy flow_ algorithm, as discussed in [9] and [10]. Algorithm is executed only on cells belonging to the _core_ of the hadronic \(\tau\), so within a distance \(\Delta R=0.2\) from a seed.

Energy deposition in cells is classified into several categories

* The _pure electromagnetic_ energy, \(E_{T}^{emcl}\). Energy collection is seeded by the _qualified_ electromagnetic cluster, namely only electromagnetic clusters with no substantial hadronic leakage behind and isolated from the _qualified_ tracks are used as seeds. Only presample, strip and middle layers are used. The closest cell to the electromagnetic cluster position is searched for, at each layer, and the distance is calculated from that cell. Energy is collected in two steps. First, narrow window in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) is used, \(0.03\,75\times 0.0375\). In a second iteration a wider window, \(2\cdot 0.0375\times 3\cdot 0.0375\) is used.
* The _charged electromagnetic_ energy, \(E_{T}^{chrgEM}\). Energy collection is seeded by the impact point of the track(s) at each layer. Presample, strip, middle and back layers are used. The closest cell to the track impact point (\(\eta,\phi\)) at each layer is searched for and the distance is calculated from that cell. Only narrow window \(0.03\,75\times 0.0375\) is used.
* The _charged hadronic_ energy, \(E_{T}^{chrgRAD}\). Energy collection is seeded by the (\(\eta,\phi\)) impact point of the track(s) at the last layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline \hline  & \(\tau_{1P}\) & \(\tau_{3P}\) \\ \hline \hline \(\eta^{\tau^{reco}}-\eta^{\tau^{truth}}\) & \(<\)\(m>=-0.7\cdot 10^{-6}\) & \(<\)\(m>=2.2\cdot 10^{-5}\) \\  & \(\sigma=1.8\cdot 10^{-4}\) & \(\sigma=3.1\cdot 10^{-4}\) \\  & \(RMS=1.2\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(RMS=4.5\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \(\phi^{\tau^{reco}}-\phi^{\tau^{truth}}\) & \(<\)\(m>=3.5\cdot 10^{-5}\) & \(<\)\(m>=-5.5\cdot 10^{-5}\) \\  & \(\sigma=6.7\cdot 10^{-4}\) & \(\sigma=6.0\cdot 10^{-4}\) \\  & \(RMS=1.2\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(RMS=5.0\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \hline \(\Delta R(\tau^{reco},\tau^{truth})<0.025\) & \(83.9\%\) & \(98.1\) \% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: _The reconstruction quality of the visible decay products of the hadronic \(\tau\)-candidates from the \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) sample, \((\eta,\phi)\) coordinates._All layers of the hadronic calorimeter are used and energy is collected in a cone \(\Delta R=0.2\).
* The _neutral electromagnetic_ energy, \(E_{T}^{neuEM}\). Energy collection is seeded by the track \((\eta,\phi)\) at vertex and the closest cell is searched for, at each layer. Energy is collected from remaining cells in a cone \(\Delta R=0.2\), only presample, strip and middle layers are used.

Algorithm for energy collection starts from collecting \(E_{T}^{emcl}\) in the narrow window, then the \(E_{T}^{chrgEM}\) and \(E_{T}^{chrgHAD}\) are collected, followed by the second iteration for the \(E_{T}^{emcl}\) performed in the wide window. As the last one, the \(E_{T}^{neuEM}\) is collected. For the \(\tau_{3P}\), the collection of \(E_{T}^{chrgEM}\), \(E_{T}^{chrgHAD}\) is done iteratively for each track.

As the reference, the total calorimetric energy associated with the \(\tau_{1P}\) or \(\tau_{3P}\) objects, \(E_{T}^{calo}\), is calculated using a cone \(\Delta R=0.4\) around the seed. Always the distance is calculated with respect to the cell, closest at a given layer to the nominal \((\eta,\phi)\) of reconstructed \(\tau_{1P}\) or \(\tau_{3P}\) objects. By definition

\[E_{T}^{calo}=E_{T}^{emcl}+E_{T}^{neuEM}+E_{T}^{chrgEM}+E_{T}^{chrgHAD}+E_{T}^ {otherHAD}+E_{T}^{otherEM} \tag{1}\]

where \(E_{T}^{otherEM}\) and \(E_{T}^{otherHAD}\) is calculated from the remaining energy deposition in a distance \(0.2<\Delta R<0.4\) from the nominal \((\eta,\phi)\) of the reconstructed hadronic \(\tau\).

In the energy-flow approach for defining energy scale of the \(\tau_{1P}\) and \(\tau_{3P}\), we replace _charged_ energy deposition, \(E_{T}^{chrgEM}+E_{T}^{chrgHAD}\) by the track(s) momenta (no hadronic neutrals), assume \(\sum\pi^{0}\) contribution to be included in \(E_{T}^{emcl}\) and \(E_{T}^{neuEM}\), we correct for residual effects with \(resE_{T}^{chrgEM}\) and \(resE_{T}^{neuEM}\), and we omit \(E_{T}^{otherHAD}\), \(E_{T}^{otherEM}\). The definition for energy scale \(E_{T}^{flow}\) reads as following:

\[E_{T}^{flow}=E_{T}^{emcl}+E_{T}^{neuEM}+\sum p_{T}^{track}+\sum resE_{T}^{chrg EMtrk}+resE_{T}^{neuEM} \tag{2}\]

For more detailed discussion how the \(resE_{T}^{chrgEM}\) and \(resE_{T}^{neuEM}\) terms are build we refer reader to [10], here we just briefly recall only final formulas.

Tracks in the \(\tau_{1P}\) object are classified into three cathegories, based on the indication if the early interaction of the hadronic track, or the \(\pi^{0}/\pi^{\pm}\) overlap took place. It is shown in [10] that early interaction is correlated with the low hadronic energy deposition around the track impact point. The \(\pi^{\pm}/\pi^{0}\) overlap is correlated with the energy deposition in the narrow window around the track in the presampler and strips layer.

* Cathegory (A): \(E_{T}^{chrgEM01}/p_{T}^{track}<0.05\)
* Cathegory (B): \(E_{T}^{chrgEM01}/p_{T}^{track}>0.05\) and \(E_{T}^{chrgHAD}/p_{T}^{track}>0.40\)
* Cathegory (C): \(E_{T}^{chrgEM01}/p_{T}^{track}>0.05\) and \(E_{T}^{chrgHAD}/p_{T}^{track}<0.40\)

Depending on the cathegory of a track, diferent formula is used for calculating residual terms, as specified in Table 3.

In case of \(\tau_{3P}\) we simplify the procedure, as we expect much smaller contribution from \(\sum\pi^{0}\). Each track is treated separately and the \(resE_{T}^{chrgEMtrk}\) is non zero only for tracksbelonging to cathegory (A). Contribution to the \(resE_{T}^{neuEM}\) is defined independently on the track cathegory. For respective formulas see Table 4.

Table 5 quantifies quality of the energy scale determination. Fraction of events accepted in the mass window of \(\pm 10\%\) and \(\pm 20\%\) around nominal value of the visible \(\tau\) energy is shown. For the \(\pm 20\%\) window the fraction is \(88.3\%\) for \(\tau_{1P}\) and \(93.8\%\) for \(\tau_{3P}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline \hline \(\mathrm{category}\) & \(resE_{T}^{chrgEMtrk}\) & \(resE_{T}^{neuEM}\) \\ \hline \hline \(\mathrm{(A)}\) & \(resE_{T}^{chrgEMtrk}=E_{T}^{chrgEMtrk}-0.7\cdot p_{T}^{track}\) & \(max(-0.1\sum p_{T}^{track},-E_{T}^{neuEM})\) \\  & \(\mathrm{or}\ 0\ \mathrm{if}\ \mathrm{negative}\) & \(max(-0.1\sum p_{T}^{track},-E_{T}^{neuEM})\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

In the bottom line profile plot of the \(E_{T}^{eflow}/E_{T}^{truth}\) ratio as a function of \(E_{T}^{truth}\) is shown. Much better resolution is obtained for reconstructed \(\tau_{3P}\) than for \(\tau_{1P}\). For both cases, the mean position of the energy scale is stable within few % over large range of the nominal energy of the visible \(\tau\).

### The calorimetric observables

Several calorimetric observables should be used to discriminate a narrow \(\tau\)-cluster from the hadronic cluster originating from quarks or gluons. As already discussed in the previous section, for a single-prong hadronic \(\tau\) decays, the cone separation between neutral electromagnetic and charged hadronic decay products is very small. For three-prongs decays, in most of cases, cone \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the bary-center of charged energy is sufficient to contain all three tracks. Just, the \(\Delta R=0.2\) is used to define core of the hadronic \(\tau\) cluster, while a larger cone, \(\Delta R=0.4\), is used for the isolation criteria. All calorimeric variables are calculated at the EM scale.

The discriminating observables which we recall below have been used previously in several analyses [3, 7, 8], although exact definitions might be slightly different.

If not stated otherwise, the calorimetric observables are calculated from cells in a distance from a seed of \(\Delta R=0.2\). The \(\tau_{1\,P}\) is seeded by the leading hadronic track at vertex (track \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) at the vertex). The \(\tau_{3\,P}\) is seeded by the bary-center of three nearby tracks. Some minimal threshold on the energy deposition in cells is also required.

* Electromagnetic radius of the \(\tau\)-candidate, \(R^{\tau}_{em}\), calculated from cells around the seed and weighted by the transverse energy deposition of a given cell. Only cells belonging to the first three samplings of the electromagnetic calorimeter (presampler, strips and middle) are used for the calculation. \[R^{\tau}_{em}=\frac{\sum\Delta R^{\tau_{1\,P},cell}\cdot E^{cell}_{T}}{\sum E ^{cell}_{T}}\] (3)
* Number of strips, \(N^{\tau}_{strips}\) with energy deposition above a certain threshold.
* The width of the energy deposition in strips, \(W^{\tau}_{strips}\), calculated as the variance in the \(\eta\) coordinate, weighted by the transverse energy deposition in a given strip. \[W^{\tau}_{strips}=\frac{\sum(\Delta\eta^{\tau_{1\,P},strip})^{2}\cdot E^{strip }_{T}}{\sum E^{strip}_{T}}-\frac{\sum(\Delta\eta^{\tau_{1\,P},strip}\cdot E^{ strip}_{T})^{2}}{(\sum E^{strip}_{T})^{2}}\] (4)
* The fraction of the transverse energy deposited, \(fracE^{R12}\), in the \(0.1~{}<~{}\Delta~{}R~{}<~{}0.2\) radius with respect to the total energy in the cone \(\Delta R=0.2\). Cells belonging to all layers of the calorimeter are used. \[fracE^{R12}_{T}=\frac{\sum E^{cell}_{T}(R^{\tau_{1\,P},cell}<0.2)-\sum E^{cell }_{T}(R^{\tau_{1\,P},cell}<0.1)}{\sum E^{cell}_{T}(R^{\tau_{1\,P},cell}<0.2)}\] (5)

In Fig. 8 we show the distributions of the above variables for the reconstructed \(\tau_{1\,P}\) and \(\tau_{3\,P}\). The distributions, as could be expected, are a bit different for both cathegories, clearly final optimisation of the selection procedure should be done separately.

We require also a minimal consistency between track transverse momenta, \(p^{track}_{T}\), and energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter, \(E^{chrgHAD}_{T}\). In addition, we impose the _isolation criteria_, namely some requirements on the energy deposited in a ring \(0.2<\Delta~{}R<0.4\), namely on the \((E^{otherEM}_{T}+E^{otherHAD}_{T})/E^{calo}_{T}\) ratio.

In Fig. 9 we show the distributions of \(E_{T}^{chrgHAD}/p_{T}^{track}\), \(E_{T}^{otherEM}\) and \(E_{T}^{otherHAD}\) for \(\tau_{1P}\) and \(\tau_{3P}\) candidates. Also for those variables, final optimisation of selection should be done separately.

Performance for signal and background samples

Performance of the algorithm for the \(\tau_{1P}\) and \(\tau_{3P}\) reconstruction and identification is evaluated below for the fully simulated true and fake hadronic \(\tau\)'s from \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\), \(q\bar{q}\to W\to\tau\nu\) events and fake hadronic \(\tau\)'s from \(q\bar{q}\to W\to e\nu\) and \(gg,gq,q\bar{q}\to gg,gq,q\bar{q}\) events. The \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(q\bar{q}\to W\to\tau\nu\) samples provide true \(\tau\) candidates from decays of gauge bosons. Those samples provide also fake \(\tau\) candidates from QCD ISR and underlying event, which are representative for background to the Higgs search from \(q\bar{q}\to W\to e\nu,\mu\nu\) events. To increase available statistics of QCD ISR fake \(\tau\) candidates we have used also directly the \(q\bar{q}\to W\to e\nu\) sample. The \(gg,gq,q\bar{q}\to gg,gq,q\bar{q}\) events, with hard-process partons which initiate hadronic cascade, provide sample of fake \(\tau\) candidates which can be attributed to gluon or quark splittings. The hard-process partons can be used as reference for evaluating efficiencies and energy scale reconstruction. More details on the samples used can be found in Appendix C.

Before discussing performance, let us present effective fraction of different hadronic \(\tau\) decays, as found in analysed \(qq\to Z\to\tau\tau\) sample from DC1 datasets and as predicted by Tauola-CLEO. The kinematical preselection of \(|\eta|<1.5\) is included. The Tauola-CLEO results were obtained with certified installation of the package [15]. The DC1 sample was generated using PYTHIA native lobup table of branching ratios. We can conclude that the level of agreement is sufficient for the analysis presented here.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline \hline Decay modes & Tauola-CLEO & in analysed DC1 sample \\ \hline \hline \(\tau\to\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) & 18.3 \% & 18.0 \% \\ \(\tau\to\pi^{0}\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) & 41.9 \% & 41.9 \% \\ \(\tau\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) & 15.1 \% & 14.7 \% \\ \(\tau\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) & 1.78 \% & 1.84 \% \\ \hline \(\tau\to\pi^{\pm}\pi^{\pm}\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) & 14.8 \% & 15.5 \% \\ \(\tau\to\pi^{0}\pi^{\pm}\pi^{\pm}\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) & 7.09 \% & 6.15 \% \\ \(\tau\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\pi^{\pm}\pi^{\pm}\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) & 0.82 \% & 0.93 \% \\ \(\tau\to\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\pi^{0}\pi^{\pm}\pi^{\pm}\pi^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) & 0.18 \% & 0.16 \% \\ \hline others & 0.03 \% & 0.76 \% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: _Fractions in the the \(qq\to Z\to\tau\tau\) sample from DC1 datasets, after preselection for \(|\eta|<\) 1.5 and hadronic \(\tau\) decays (with kaons excluded as well). Shown are also fractions as estimated from Tauola-CLEO, extracted from Table 1._True hadronic \(\tau^{\prime}s\) from \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(q\bar{q}\to W\to\tau\nu\) events

The content of the true hadronic \(\tau\) samples have been studied from the Monte Carlo truth information. Table 7 gives the fraction of hadronic \(\tau\) events passing the different selection cuts on the particle level. The numbers are given for \(\tau\to\it had\)\(\nu\) decays (with \(\tau\to KX\nu\) excluded) within a rapidity acceptance of \(|\eta|<1.5\). Approximately \(4.0\cdot 10^{4}\) true hadronic \(\tau\)'s decays from \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(2.0\cdot 10^{4}\) from \(q\bar{q}\to W\to\tau\nu\) events have been found and analysed within kinematical acceptance.

Respectively, 27.8% of the hadronically decaying \(\tau\)'s will form true \(\tau_{1P}\) candidates: single-prong with \(E_{T}^{truth}>20\) GeV and \(p_{T}^{\pi\pm}>10\) GeV; and 10.8% of the hadronically decaying \(\tau\)'s will form true \(\tau_{3P}\) candidates: three-prongs with \(E_{T}^{truth}>20\) GeV and \(\it max(p_{T}^{\pi\pm})>10\) GeV and \(\it min(p_{T}^{\pi\pm})<2\) GeV.

At the particle level, defining core of the hadronic decay of the \(\tau\) with \(\Delta R=0.2\) is adequate. For three-prongs decays 98.9% of \(\tau^{\prime}s\) accepted by other selection is contained within a cone \(\Delta R=0.2\). For single-prong decays this fractions is higher than 99.5%.

efficiency is 82.0%. For single prong decays this efficiency is of 90.3%, dominated by the inefficiency for a track to be classified as _good quality_ track. For three-prong decays reconstruction efficiency is of 60.6%, also dominated by the inefficiency for all three tracks to be classified as _good quality_ tracks. Let us recall, that for low \(p_{T}^{track}\) this efficiency is only about 80% per track, see Fig. 3. Some small loss is also due to the requirement of the charge consistency. We can conclude that the performance and purity of the \(\tau_{1P}\) reconstruction is very good. For \(\tau_{3P}\) reconstruction efficiency is much lower but still reasonable, some inefficiency could be recovered by relaxing requirement on the quality of the nearby tracks.

The total efficiency for reconstructing hadronic \(\tau\)'s as \(\tau_{1P}\) or \(\tau_{3P}\) is 32.0%. Out of those, about 78.4% will be reconstructed as \(\tau_{1P}\) and 20.4% and \(\tau_{3P}\). When compared to the branching ratios, with proposed algorithm the total efficiency for reconstructing single-prong is 32.7% and three-prongs is 28.8%. About 15% of the three-prongs candidates, \(\tau_{3P}\), come from single-prong decays (the nearby tracks come from underlying event or QCD ISR/FSR).

In the following a simple cut-based identification selection is proposed, using calorimetric variables as discussed in Section 3. Table 9 shows cumulative acceptances for identification selection. Only for two of those variables different thresholds are used for \(\tau_{1P}\) and \(\tau_{3P}\) identification. The cumulative acceptance is 58.8% and 57.3% respectively. The profile plot as a function of \(E_{T}^{truth}\) for the reconstruction efficiency and reconstruction+identification efficiency, with respect to hadronic \(\tau\)'s, which pass the kinematical selection at truth level is shown in Fig. 11.

Fig. 12 shows the same efficiency but with respect to all hadronic \(\tau\)'s. Final numbers are summarised in Table 10. With respect to all hadronic decays, total efficiency of proposed algorithm is 18.6% with one-prong mode contributing 14.7% and three-prongs 3.75%.

### Fake hadronic \(\tau^{l}s\) from dijet events

To evaluate rejection power of the proposed algorithm against fake \(\tau^{l}s\) we have studied with the full simulation background sample of QCD di-jet events from \(gg,gq,q\bar{q}\to gg,gq,q\bar{q}\) process, called in following the dijet35 sample. This sample is clearly biased because was generated with minimal threshold on the transverse momenta of hard scattering, \(p_{T}^{hard}>35\) GeV. Fig. 13 shows transverse momenta distribution of the hard process partons in this sample. It nevertheless provides large statistics of jets in the relevant kinematic region and allows for straightforward control on the reconstruction and identification efficiency (hard-process parton can be used as a reference).

In total, we have analysed \(2\cdot 10^{5}\) events from dijet35 sample. The kinematical selection of \(p_{T}^{hard}\) and \(|\eta|<1.5\) has been passed by \(1.4\cdot 10^{5}\) partons from hard scattering; 82% of them gluons and 18% quarks.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline \hline Selection/Acceptance & \(\tau\)’s & single-prong \(\tau\) & three-prongs \(\tau\) \\ \hline \hline \(\tau\to\)_had_\(\nu\) & 100.0 \% & 76.7 \% & 22.7 \% \\ \hline \hline + reconstruction & 32.0 \% & 25.1 \% & 6.54 \% \\ \hline \hline + identification & 18.6 \% & 14.7 \% & 3.75 \% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

In the acceptance of \(|\eta|<1.5\) and hadronic decays only, effectively available sample of hadronic \(\tau\) decays was \(4\cdot 10^{4}\) from \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(2\cdot 10^{4}\) from \(q\bar{q}\to W\to\tau\nu\) events._

Requirement on the charge consistency accepts 93% of reconstructed \(\tau_{3P}\) candidates. Only 75% of all \(\tau_{1P}\) and \(\tau_{3P}\) candidates were matching hard-process partons, the matching was defined as \(\Delta R<0.2\) between hard-process parton and \(\tau_{1P}\) or \(\tau_{3P}\) candidates. About 25% candidates were not matching, just were reconstructed from FSR/IRS radiation.

Tables 11 and 12 summarise efficiencies for reconstructing \(\tau_{1P}\) of \(\tau_{3P}\) matching hard-process parton. Probability for quarks fragmenting to fake \(\tau\) is almost three times higher than for gluons, fragmentation of gluons gives on average higher track multiplicities. For the same reason we should expect higher background in \(\tau_{3P}\) than \(\tau_{1P}\) subsamples. In total, in the studied di-jet sample, efficiency for reconstructing fake \(\tau_{1P}\) matching hard-process parton is 2.0% and fake \(\tau_{3P}\) is 4.2%.

It is important to realise, that \(E_{T}^{eflow}\) calculation, optimised for the true hadronic \(\tau^{\prime}s\), significantly underestimate energy scale for the fake \(\tau^{\prime}s\) with respect truth energy. Just, it helps in rejecting background from QCD jets as requires much harder hard-process parton than the nominal threshold on the energy scale of the \(\tau_{1P}\) and \(\tau_{3P}\). Figs. 16 and 17 (in Appendix A) show for fake hadronic \(\tau\)'s the \(E_{T}^{eflow}/E_{T}^{truth}\) as estimated with the algorithm proposed here.

For the study of identification selection, we have collected statistics of 3120 \(\tau_{1P}\) and 6 600 \(\tau_{3P}\) from dijet35 sample. Efficiencies for simple cut-based selection are summarised in Table 15. The rejection power of the identification selection itself is rather moderate. Just reconstruction algorithm provides sample of \(\tau_{1P}\) and \(\tau_{3P}\) fake candidates very similar to the those from true \(\tau^{\prime}s\). One should also notice more than factor three spread between rejection against fake \(\tau_{1P}\) from gluons and fake \(\tau_{3P}\) from quarks.

Fake hadronic \(\tau^{\prime}s\) from \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(q\bar{q}\to W\to\tau\nu\) events

The fake \(\tau^{\prime}s\) from the \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(q\bar{q}\to W\to\tau\nu\) events will represent physics background to the Higgs searches in \(H\to\tau\tau\) channel. The seeding partons come from QCD ISR (initial state radiation), transverse momentum spectrum and shape of the shower of cascading partons will depend on the implementation of the QCD shower used.

We have processed about \(2\cdot 10^{5}\) events of the \(q\bar{q}\to W\to\tau\nu\), \(q\bar{q}\to W\to e\nu\) and \(q\bar{q}\to Z\to\tau\tau\) samples and we have reconstructed about 3000 fake \(\tau_{1P}\) and 3200 fake \(\tau_{3P}\) candidates. The \(E_{T}^{\it efflow}\) distribution is shown in Fig. 15. It is noticeably softer than the sample analysed from dijet35 events.

Identification selection will reduce these numbers to 0.46% and 0.57% respectively.

We have checked with simple Atlfast [17] reconstruction, that in 18% of events one would expect non-calibrated jet with threshold \(p_{T}^{jet}>20\) GeV. Roughly, proposed here reconstruction and identification corresponds to rejection power of 30 against such a jet, for each cathegory separately. Clearly including three-prongs cathegory will increase by a factor of two background from QCD ISR radiation.

### Outlook

In this note we discussed further developement of a new algorithm, presented initially in [8], for hadronic \(\tau\) reconstruction and identification, based on the track-seeded reconstruction and energy-flow definition of the energy scale. The algorithm is intended for studies of the low mass Higgs (120 GeV) and the visible energy from the hadronic \(\tau\) decays in the range 20 - 50 GeV.

* The reconstruction process for the \(\tau\) visible decay products requires: reconstructed, good quality and relatively high \(p_{T}\) track(s), and then collected calorimetric energy deposition in a fixed cone seeded by the track \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) at the vertex (for single-prong mode) or bary-center of tracks at vertex (for three-prongs mode). The rigorous veto on electron and/or muon tracks is assumed.
* The energy scale of the reconstructed hadronic \(\tau\) decay is obtained from the energy-flow approach: energy deposited in the calorimeter is classified for its type; the charged energy is replaced by the track(s) momentum of \(\pi^{\pm}\); only the neutral electromagnetic energy, consistent with originating from \(\pi^{0}\) decays, is included in the estimate.
* For the identification process, both calorimetric and energy-flow observables are used. The dedicated optimisation of the single-prong and three-prong decays is assumed.

The main concept is different from the ATLAS _base line_tauRec algorithm within the Athena framework [7].

Using only qualified tracks and seeding reconstruction by the track(s) at vertex gives very good precision for defining direction of the visible decay products of the \(\tau\) decays. Respectively 83.9% (single-prong) and 98.1% (three-prongs) candidates are contained within \(\Delta R(\tau^{reco},\tau^{truth})<0.025\) window.

Energy-flow approach used for defining energy scale gives good resolution, without any additional calibration, and stable estimate within few % over large range of the nominal energy of the visible \(\tau\). About 88.3% (single-prong) and 93.8% (three-prongs) candidates are contained within window \(<E_{T}^{eflow}/E_{T}^{truth}>\) = 0.8 - 1.2. An important advantage of the energy-flow procedure is that by construction it significantly underestimates energy scale for fake \(\tau\) from QCD radiation (with respect to the truth) and therefore requires much harder partons to originate fake candidates than the nominal energy threshold of the accepted hadronic \(\tau\)'s. As a consequence the initial level of the fake background is much lower than with the _base line_ algorithm (see also comparison in [8]).

Identification selection based on the simple cut-based criteria is rather moderate. Separate optimisation of the identification of single-prong and three-prongs candidates seems promising and not explored yet to full extend. Possible improvements should come further optimisation of the identification variables (eg. as used in [18]) and also with using more advanced statistical techniques like eg. multi-variate analysis [19].

The total efficiency achieved with presented here algorithm is 18.6% with respect to all hadronic decays in the \(q\bar{q}\to Z\tau\tau\) sample, with single-prongs contributing 14.7% and three-prongs 3.75%. Respectively rejection against fake \(\tau^{\prime}s\) originating from hard-process gluons (quarks) is 700 (150) for the \(\tau_{1P}\) and 100 (30) for \(\tau_{3P}\) candidates in the transverse-momenta range of 35-50 GeV. Clearly, the \(\tau_{3P}\) cathegor will have much higher background, with rather small gain for the total signal.

Presented above results are very encouraging, but certainly should be confirmed in the full pseudorapidity range and with adding effects from electronic-noise and pile-up.

Algorithms for the hadronic-\(\tau\) candidate

The algorithm for \(\tau_{1P}\) reconstruction was coded in the root classes, in a form of a package build into single executable. This package as input reads Athena CBNT.root file and produces much smaller.root file with information on the reconstructed \(\tau_{1P}\)-objects, \(\tau_{3P}\)-objects and \(\tau_{Kine}\)-objects.

The following classes are available:

* EvenTuple for retrieving information from the.root file conting ATHENA-CBNT.
* EvenInfo for storing information on the reconstructed quantities during execution of the algorithm.
* AlgoTracks for qualifying leading hadronic track.
* AlgoClusters for qualifying electromagnetic cluster.
* AlgoMCTruth for building information on the true \(\tau\) decay, the \(\tau_{Kine}\) objects.
* AlgoTau1P for building \(\tau_{1P}\) object.
* AlgoTau3P for building \(\tau_{3P}\) object.
* ToolKinLib and ToolPrintEvent for calculation of kinematical quantities and printout.
* TreeManager and HistoManager for controling initialisation, filling and storage of the ROOT histograms and trees.

The new.root file is further analysed with the simple root classes and macros.

### Algorithm for qualifying leading hadronic track: AlgoTracks

The algorithm works as following:

* Reconstructed XXalman track is considered if it is within pseudorapidity range limited by \(|\eta|<\) RecoEta_cut.
* Reconstructed XXalman track is qualified if
* It is not an electron or a muon track (information extracted from truth)
* A0Vert < A0Vert_cut,
* NSiHits > NSiHits_cut,
* NSrawHits > NSrawHits_cut
* Chi2 < Chi2_cut
* Reconstructed XXalman track is labeled as _true \(\tau\) track_ if it is matching truth particle originated from \(\tau\) decays.

* The leading hadronic track is required to have transverse momentum \(p_{T}>\) pTleadTrack_cut. It is also required that the numer of other tracks with \(p_{T}>\) pTOtherTrack_cut within space distance \(\Delta R<\)detROtherTrack_cut is not bigger than NOtherTracks_cut.

The default value of the parameters (datamembers of the class) are specified below (AlgoTracks.datacard).

```
i0Vert_cut = 1.0 (units inm) iTRHits_cut = 5 (not used) iStauWits_cut = 10 jSiiHs_cut = 9 Cni2_cut = 1.7 RecoEta_cut = 1.5 pTLeadTrack_cut = 10.0 pTOtherTrack_cut = 2.0 (units in GeV) detROtherTrack_cut = 0.2 iOtherTracks_cut = 2
```

### Algorithm for qualifying electromagnetic cluster: AlgoClusters

The algorithm works as following:

* Reconstructed EG cluster is considered if it is within pseudorapidity range limited by \(|\eta|<\)RecoEta_cut.
* Reconstructed EG cluster is qualified if the distance from the impact point of the closest qualified track is \(|\Delta\phi|>\)TrackEGclusPhi2_cut (at second sampling of the calorimeter) and \(|\Delta\eta|>\)TrackEGclusEta1_cut at first sampling of the calorimeter. Also it is required that the hadronic leakage being the cluster is smaller than EGclusEta1_cut.

The default value of the parameters (datamembers of the class) are specified below (AlgoTracks.datacard).

```
EGclusET_cut0.2 TrackEGclusPhi2_cut0.0375 TrackEGclusEta1_cut0.01 EGclusEta1_cut0.10 RecoEta_cut1.5
```

### Algorithm for building \(\tau_{1P}\)-object: AlgoTau1P

This algorithm starts from a collection of leading hadronic tracks and selects only those for which there is no other accompanying tracks, NOtherTracks = 0. Such track becomes a seed for the \(\tau_{1P}\) object.

For each \(\tau_{1P}\) object calorimetric variables are calculated.

* The infomation of the energy deposition of all cells within space distance \(\Delta R<\)RconeTrack_cut and with energy deposition above ETcellmin_cut is used.
* For calculating calorimetric variables entirely based on the energy deposition in strips (NStrips and WStrips) only strips with energy deposition above ETstripmin_cut are used. For calculating NStrips only strips within distance in pseudorapidity smaller than detstrip_cut are used (of course the basic \(\Delta R<\)RconeCore_cut condition has to be also fulfilled). The WStrips is calculated using all strips within RconeCore_cut distance.

* The charged energy, associated with a track is calculated from energy deposition in cells within the \((\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi)\) window, is defined by dphiChrgEM_cut, detaChrgEM_cut for the electromagnetic samplings and by RconeCore_cut for the hadronic samplings.
* The neutral electromagnetic energy, associated with a track, is calculated from the remaining energy deposition in cells within RconeCore_cut and belonging to the first three layers of the electromagnetic calorimeter.
* The \(E_{T}^{calo}\) and \(E_{T}^{efflow}\) are calculated.

For each of the \(\tau_{1P}\)-objects given is also information on the index (in the original CBNT) of the true \(\tau\) (if applicable) and origin of the track guiding reconstruction of the \(\tau_{1P}\)-object.

The default value of the parameters (datamembers of the class) are specified below (AlgoTau1P.datacard).

ETcellmin_cut 0.1 (units in GeV) ETstripmin_cut 0.2 (units in GeV) detaStrip_cut 0.2 (units in GeV) RconeCore_cut 0.2 RconeTan_cut 0.4 dphiEMCL_cut 0.0375 dphiEMCL_cut 3 detaEMCLFAC_cut 2 dphiChrgEM_cut 0.0375 detaChrgEM_cut 0.0375

### Algorithm for building \(\tau_{3P}\)-object: AlgoTau3P

This algorithm starts from a collection of leading hadronic tracks and selects only those for which there is no other accompanying tracks, NOtherTracks = 0. Such a track becomes a seed for the \(\tau_{3P}\) object.

For each candidate calorimetric variables are calculated.

* The infomation of the energy deposition of all cells within space distance \(\Delta R<\)RconeTrack_cut and with energy deposition above ETcellmin_cut is used.
* For calculating calorimetric variables entirely based on the energy deposition in strips (NStrips and WStrips) only strips with energy deposition above detaStrip_cut are used. For calculating NStrips only strips within distance in pseudorapidity smaller than detaStrip_cut are used (of course the basic \(\Delta R<\)RconeTrack_cut condition has to be also fulfilled). The WStrips is calculated using all strips within RconeTrack_cut distance.
* The charged energy associated with a track is calculated from energy deposition in cells within the \((\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi)\) window around a track which is defined by dphiChrgEM_cut, detaChrgEM_cut for the electromagnetic samplings and by RconeCore_cut for the hadronic samplings.
* The neutral electromagnetic energy associated with a track is calculated from the remaining energy deposition in cells within RconeCore_cut and belonging to the first three layers of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

* The \(E_{T}^{\mathit{calo}}\) and \(E_{T}^{\mathit{efflow}}\) are calculated.

For each of the \(\tau_{3P}\)-objects also information on the index (in the original CBNT) of the true \(\tau\) (if applicable) and origin of the track guiding reconstruction of the \(\tau_{3P}\)-object is given.

The default value of the parameters (datamembers of the class) are specified below (AlgoTau3P.datacard).

```
ETcellmin_cut0.1(unitsinGeV) ETstripmin_cut0.2(unitsinGeV) detaStrip_cut0.2(unitsinGeV) ReconeZero_cut0.2 konemat_cut0.4 dphiEMCL_cut0.0375 detaEMCL_cut0.0375 dphiEMCLFAC_cut3 detaEMCLFAC_cut2 dphiChrgEM_cut0.0375 detaChrgEM_cut0.0375
```

### Algorithm for building \(\tau_{Kine}\)-object: AlgoMCTruth

This algorithm starts from a collection of MC particles, selects true \(\tau\) particle and loop over its daughters. It accepts particles if they are in the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<\mathit{RecoEta\_cut}\). It calculates the bary-center of the \(\tau\) visible decay products, total transverse energy, bary-center position and multiplicities of \(\pi^{0}\)'s, total transverse energy, bary-center position and multiplicities of \(\pi^{\pm}\). For each \(\tau_{Kine}\)-object information on the index (in the original CBNT) of the true \(\tau\) is also given.

The default value of the parameters (datamembers of the class) are specified below (AlgoMCTruth.datacard).

## Appendix C Packages used for reconstruction

We have used ATLAS Release 7.8.0 to perform reconstruction of the fully simulated events. The default parameters were used for XKalman track reconstruction and energy reconstruction in calorimetric cells. Information on reconstructed quantities were stored in the format of ROOT CBNT. We have used information from the default CBNT_Truth and CBNT_Track blocks. In addition, two extensions have been introduced:

* The full cell map was stored in the CBNT.
* The track vicinity in each layer of the calorimeter was calculated and stored in the CBNT.

Data samples used for the analysis

The following physics events samples have been used:

* The 100 000 \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events (Ztautau sample) reconstructed from dataset 4 /castor/cern.ch/atlas/project/dc1/simul/data/002054/dc1.002054.simul.000xx.hlt.pyt_Z_tautau.zebra.
* The 30 000 \(W\to e\nu\) events (wtoen sample), reconstructed from dataset /castor/cern.ch/atlas/project/egamma/simul/egamma.002510.pyt_w_enu.simul/data/egamma.002510.pyt_w_enu.simul_00xx.zebra. We have used all available events.
* The 100 000 \(W\to\tau\nu\) events (wtoaunun sample), reconstructed from dataset gridftp.fzk.de/grid/fzk.de/software/atlas/dc1/simul/data/002053/dc1.002053.si. We have used all available events.
