**Electrical Design and Performance of Single- and Double-Sided Silicon Modules for the ATLAS Phase II Upgrade**

ITK-SC Module Working Group

For the full replacement of the ATLAS tracker during the Phase II Upgrade, the design and construction of a Silicon Strip Detector is currently being planned. In this note, the design plans for the readout structures (hybrids), Silicon-strip modules, readout and powering bus tapes and end-of-substructure cards for the ATLAS Silicon strip system are described. Module assembly and specific tooling are detailed. This document is one of five supporting documents for the silicon strip chapter of the ATLAS Phase II Letter of Intent.

## 1 Introduction

The smallest building blocks of the ATLAS Silicon Strip Upgrade for the Phase II Upgrade will be modules. A module consists of one sensor and one to four thin readout structures (hybrids). Two complementary support structure solutions are considered: the baseline approach with single-sided modules mounted on "staves" in the barrel and on "petals" in the end cap; and an alternative "super module" approach using double-sided modules. In this document the module design and the production methods for both approaches are described. Common aspects for both designs, in addition the end-of-substructure electronics are described. The support structure (local support) as well as the ASIC chip sets are covered in separate documents.

#### 1.0.1 Staves and Petals

The baseline concepts for the integration of these single-sided modules are staves [1] and petals described in more detail in [2] in which the modules are positioned on a local support structure. The support structures are highly integrated with short cooling paths between the ASICs, the sensors, and the cooling pipes; these short cooling paths lead to a lower amount of material in the module supports. The core of the local support structure consists of a Titanium cooling tube sandwiched between two carbon fiber facings, spaced with either carbon honeycomb or foam. Figure 1 shows the top view of a full stave with 13 modules on each side of the stave, one stave side having axial strips and the other side small angle stereo. The End-of-Substructure electronics (see Section 3.4) will be positioned on an ear-like extension of the stave shown in Figure 1. The petal is mechanically merely a stave with a trapezoidal shape (Figure 5). Each petal side has 9 silicon sensors and 13 hybrids.

### Super-Modules

In the super-module concept [3], individual short-strip or long-strip double-sided stereo modules are attached to a light, stable carbon-fiber local support that is inserted into the overall tracker support

structure, as shown in figure 2. On each side of the support, high conductivity cooling blocks provide mechanical attachments for the modules and a thermal path to cooling tubes connected with high conductivity grease to minimize thermal stress. On one side of the support, also in thermal contact to the cooling, a multilayer cable bus transfers signals from each module to the End-of-Stave electronics. The local support holds 13 modules.

## 2 Silicon Strip Module Description

In this section the overall description of the different module types is given. Due to the large number of single-sided modules (\(>\) 21000), the module also has been designed for mass production and for low cost. The production steps and the expected performance will be described later in this document.

### Barrel Single-Sided Modules

Modules are constructed by directly gluing kapton flex hybrids to silicon sensors with electronics-grade epoxy. The design is focused on material reduction with no substrate between kapton and sensor, taking advantage of the heat path through the large cross-sectional area to the underlying mechanical support with an embedded cooling (known as the stave, see Section 1.0.1). This layout differs from the current SCT design, where heat from ASICs and detectors is conducted out laterally through lower cross-section paths leading to the module edge.

Two different strip lengths are foreseen: long strips are possible in the lower occupancy region at larger radii, whereas further subdivision with shorter strips is required at lower radii. Therefore also two different module types are required for the single sided barrel concept: short and long barrel modules where "short" and "long" refers to the strip length. The short barrel modules contain two hybrids, each with 10 readout ASICs (ABCN130), and a Hybrid Controller Chip (HCC). Long barrel modules have only one hybrid. The single sided module for the barrel region of the Silicon strip detector consist of:

* one silicon strip sensor (with 5120 strips in 4 rows or 2560 strips in 2 rows)
* one or two hybrid PCB boards made of multilayer flexible kapton
* 10 ASIC readout chips per hybrid(ABCn130)
* 1 Hybrid Controller ASIC per hybrid(HCC)

For the short barrel modules there are two potential configurations for the positioning of the hybrids, shown in Figure 4:

Figure 3: Photograph of a barrel single-sided module using ABCn250 (prototype of 2011).

* standard configuration: the same hybrid is glued onto alternative columns of the sensor
* symmetric-inboard configuration: two mirrored hybrids are glued onto the inner columns of the sensor

For the module production, the standard module is preferred as only one hybrid type would be needed for the short and long strip modules, therefore simplifying the entire production chain. The symmetric layout forces two hybrid types (see section 5.1). The symmetric layout has the advantages of having two adjacent column without hybrid when mounted onto a stave; this may be a benefit for hybrid-to-bus tape bonding, module mounting and stave handling. In addition, the symmetric layout minimizes the distance between hybrids which may be crucial for noise performance. The choice between the two alternatives can only be made when the whole electrical chain is fully designed.

### End Cap Single-Sided Modules

Both forward regions are covered with end-caps, each built out of discs covered with single sided modules similar to the modules described in Section 2.1. The discs are subdivided into wedge shaped substructures (petals) providing the local support for those modules. At the same time the disks are subdivided into 6 rings, the number of rings resulting from the maximal possible sensor sizes (6 inch wafers). The rings are numbered from R0 to R5 by increasing radius. Due to occupancy considerations, shorter strips will be necessary at the lower radii. In the rings 0 and 1, the sensor will be read out by four and two hybrids, respectively. At larger radii, the sensors are split in two columns readout by one hybrid. Due to the changing number of strips different numbers of readout chips per hybrid are also necessary. In table 1, the number of chips for the different rings are given. In Figure 5, a sketch of a petal showing the six rings of sensors and the different types of hybrids is shown (this sketch is based on an older layout and the number of hybrids and chips in not correct). On the sides of the petal ears are indicated which will house the EoS cards.

Mechanically, the petal was derived from the stave design, and has taken many features from the stave concept. The biggest difference in the modules for barrel and end-caps is the geometry of the sensors. The complex shape of the petals results in six different sensor and module layouts. Electrically there are some differences between how the barrel staves and the end-cap petals approach modules, mainly due to the transition from one to two sensors per ring on a petal. This has significant impact on the hybrid design and the bus tape routing. At the time of writing no decision has been made and therefore the options will be presented here.

Figure 4: Two potential configurations for short strip modules. a) Standard with two identical hybrids, b) symmetric-inboard with two mirrored

In "Option-1", the modules are serviced via a bus tape carrying data and power on the same side of the petal. Each sensor would be serviced by its own hybrid. This simplifies the module testing procedure, while the routing of the hybrid is more complex and requires a left and right hybrid design. For the second option, "Option-2" power and data signals are routed via the two sides of the petal separately as with the staves. Single hybrids would bridge the two sensors in the rings R4 to R6. Here the sensors would need to be connected due to stability reasons. In Figure 6, both design options are sketched. A third option "Option-3" is aimed for a completely symmetric design. In Figure 7 the orange box indicates the EOS. The other EOS is on the other side of the other (black) ear. It is called the "symmetric petal" because both sides are identical: if one rotates the petal 180 degrees about the central long axis, the petal is identical. Hybrids are connected at one side only. One EOS serves 6 modules on one side and 3 outer modules on the other.

### Barrel Double-Sided Modules

The double-sided module (DSM) is largely based on the SCT barrel module used in the current Inner Detector. The module is designed for: repairability and replaceability operations up to the last assembly stage; accurate space-point formation for pattern recognition due to the short distance between detector planes; hermeticity of the tracker in both \(R\phi\) and \(Z\); and ease of testing in heterogeneous environments due to the relatively small size of a single module.

A photograph of a module using ABCN250 [4, 5] and cartoon-like layout of the DSM using ABCN130 are shown in Figures 8 and 9 respectively. The DSM is composed of two \(\sim 10\times 10\) cm\({}^{2}\) n-on-p silicon micro-strip sensors glued to a central Thermo-Pyrolitic-Graphite (TPG) base-board. The TPG ensures

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Ring & Hybrid & Number & Strip Length \\  & & of ABCn130 & [mm] \\ \hline \hline R0 & H0 & 8 & 8.1 + 14.1 \\ \hline  & H1 & 9 & 14.1+12.1 \\ \hline  & H2 & 9 & 12.1+13.1 \\ \hline  & H3 & 10 & 13.1+18.1 \\ \hline R1 & H4 & 11 & 24.3+18.3 \\ \hline  & H5 & 11 & 21.3 \\ \hline R2 & H6 & 12 & 31.3 \\ \hline R3 & H7 & 7 & 58.3 \\ \hline R4 & H8 & 8 & 54.4 \\ \hline R5 & H9 & 9 & 49.9 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

excellent thermal contact for optimum heat dissipation. Two aluminum-nitride (AlN) facing plates are located at the ends of the TPG base-board, which is in contact with the cooling blocks via thermal grease. Two u-shaped hybrids, one per module side, are bridged on top of the facings using carbon-carbon sheets underneath the flex circuits. This ensures that the hybrids remain electrically and thermally decoupled from the silicon sensors. Precision washers will accurately position the module on the support structure using the six holes in the AlN facing plates (see section 1.1).

## 3 Hybrids, Bus Tape and End-of-Substructure Description

### Hybrids for the Single-Sided Modules

The hybrids [6] for the single-sided modules are designed to minimize material usage. Wire bonds instead of connectors are used to make the electrical connections to the service bus tape; the hybrids use a kapton flex technology with no laminated stiffener. A large number of hybrids (\(\sim 30000\)) will have to be assembled, bonded, and tested in the approximately three year long assembly period, so low cost, industrialized production is important. These requirements have lead to a panelized design of the hybrids as shown in Figure 3. Using the ABCN25 during the R&D phase, each hybrid for the short strip barrel has two columns of 10 ASICs; the final hybrid will have one column of 10 ABCN130.

Current hybrids have on-board shunt control with discrete SMD component for serial powering (SP). Both available SP as well as DC-DC converters have been tested with current hybrids using 250 nm ASIC, only requiring changes of single wire bonds and external power configuration. In the future, custom power control ASICs will be used which set off-hybrid on the local support; the various available configurations will again be selectable by single wire bonds.

The three metal-layer hybrids will use conservative design rules (100 \(\mu\)m track and gap, blind laser-drilled vias with 375 \(\mu\)m lands with 150 \(\mu\)m drill, and 50 \(\mu\)m adhesive-less polyimide dielectrics) in order to have high yields at low prices with more than one large volume foundry available; currently stave and petal hybrids are produced by two different foundries using very similar design rules. The

flex is selectively laminated to a FR4 carrier which acts as a temporary substrate during assembly, wire bonding and testing. The carrier allows for the industrial machine placement and solder re-flow of passive components. Wire bonding, while done currently in-house, can proceeded at rates consistent with mass production; with the 250 nm ABCNext, hybrid bonding takes 10-15 minutes per hybrid.

The hybrid size and associated material will be greatly reduced with the 130 nm CMOS ASIC set as the number of ASICs halves and their size shrinks; preliminary layouts estimate a hybrid size of \(98\) mm \(\times\) 15 mm \(\times\) 190 \(\mu\)m. With the final ASIC set (ABCN130, powering ASIC and Hybrid Controller Chip (HCC)), all the hybrids in a panel can be tested at once with only one data I/O and one power connection, furthering the industrialization capacity of hybrid production and testing. For the barrel probably only two hybrid types are necessary while the end-cap requires 6 or 9 hybrid types depending on the electrical design decision ("Bear vs. "Lamb and Flag").

### Hybrids for the Double-Sided Modules

The hybrid [5] to be used in the double-sided modules allow for various powering and grounding schemes to be investigated by changing wire bonding on the hybrid and applying different external voltages. The hybrid power unit will be integrated as close as possible to the two hybrid rows to the module facing, which will optimize the heat exchange to the cooling plate. The interconnection of the module will be made by one pigtail per side that will directly connect to a service bus running along the super-module and toward the super-module controller (SMC) card (see Fig. 9).

A hybrid is composed of two double-sided flexible polyimide (PI) sheets with four circuit layers (L1-L4) with a 0.8 mm pitch miniature Samtec connector. It holds 20 ABCN130 ASICs [8] arranged in two columns of ten. The first two layers, L1 and L2, carry the main circuit patterns for the front-end chips while layer L3 and L4 are used for power distribution and grounding respectively. All Cu/PI sheets are made with adhesive-less technology, being the thickness of the polyimide and copper sheet of 25 and 12 \(\upmu\)m respectively. Electrical connections among different layers are realized by either through-holes, penetrating all layers, or laser-cut via-holes between two adjacent layers. The usage of the button plating technology (plating in a limited area around the holes instead of having a whole plated surface) reduce the weight of the bare circuit by \(\sim\) 40%.

400 \(\upmu\)m thick carbon-carbon(CC) sheets are glued underneath the flex circuit to bridge the hybrid over the silicon sensor avoiding any interference with the detector surface. Fig. 10 shows pictures of the top and bottom sides of the bare circuits used with current ABCn250, and after including the CC-sheet on the bottom side. The CC bridge provides mechanical rigidity and improves thermal performance. Seventeen thermal through-holes are added underneath the analogue part of each ASIC. These vertical copper holes are filled with thermally and electrically conducting glue. This ensures thermal and electrical connections between each chip and the CC bridge.

### Bus Tape

#### 3.3.1 Stave and Petal Bus Tapes

The integrated electro-thermal-mechanical stave and petal concepts includes a laminated aluminum-copper-kapton bus structure which distributes the Timing Trigger and Control (TTC), the Detector Control System (DCS) signals and the power to the hybrid, provides for digital data return, and acts like a shield between the fast signals and the modules. The bus tape lamination occurs in a single "co-curing" step coincident with the formation of the stave facings themselves. This serves to minimize material, to control thicknesses, and to simplify and reduce the cost of stave construction. The bus will be designed as a controlled impedance structure. The bus prototype is shown in Figure 11 and the impedance structure is shown in Figure 12 which specifies the thicknesses of the various layers. The calculated impedance is about 70 Ohms. The bus contains two conducting layers. Signals and current flow on a copper layer which is fabricated from \(\frac{1}{2}\) ounce copper with 100 \(\mu\)m minimum track and gap. Shielding is provided by a 25 \(\mu\)m thick aluminum layer. A variant of this design dispenses with most of the aluminum and instead has the bus tape co-cured inside the stave/petal carbon fiber core, utilizing the carbon fiber also as an electrical shield layer. Other variants attempt to reduce the material in the aluminum shield by either thinning it or hatching it with various fill-factors. The bus tapes for the staves are up to 1.3 m in length. Two sources for these long cables have been identified and multiple prototyping orders have been placed and successfully delivered from both. Signals from the bus are interfaced to the hybrid via LVDS or M-LVDS receivers within the HCC chip. In the case of serial power, these signals are AC coupled using external components which precede the HCC. Interconnections between the bus and the HCC or other hybrid components are done with aluminum wedge bonds. In the case of serial power the 1/2 ounce copper is sufficient to carry current along the stave/petal. For DC-DC powering, the power traces may need to be supplied by a separate thicker power bus which would replace the (approx.) 6 mm at one edge of the bus. The petal bus is shorter than the stave bus so no particular difficulty is foreseen in the manufacture, performance, or integration of this component.

Depending on the electrical design of the petal ("The Bear" or "Lamb and Flag", see Section 2.2), either one or two different bus tapes will be needed. The baseline solution proposes bus tapes only at the edges of the petal (Figure 6), with no tape material under the sensors as for the stave. This reduces width of the tape, easing manufacture. It also reduces the thermal impedance between the modules and the cooling pipe. Depending on the detailed layout of the petal, a bridge tape will be needed to connect both tapes to the EoS. The tapes would have a trapezoidal shape, with required widths to carry all the lines between 30mm and 10mm.

#### 3.3.2 Bus tape and EOS for the double-sided modules

For the super-modules, the most important outstanding R&D issue is the development of a very compact and low mass service bus, which would allow for integration of the super-module rows without any clash at all radii. The design being evaluated foresees a significant width reduction by implementing all electrical lines within 20 mm. The design will benefit from the development and production of the IBL stave flex which is a mixture of aluminum and copper, significantly reducing the material budget [7]. The preliminary design has 5 layers: two aluminum layers for the LV supply and 3 copper layers for

Figure 10: Pictures of the bare flex printed circuit front (top) and back-side (middle), and after mounting the carbon-carbon sheet and the 0.8 mm-pitch miniature Samtec (CLE-130-01-G-DV) connector (bottom). The thermal through-holes underneath the readout ASICs are visible in the middle picture.

the data, slow-control (DCS) and high voltage. At each connection area, a stiffener will ease insertion and extraction of the electrical coupling. It will additionally allow a reinforced mechanical coupling of the two service bus sides without an external support frame. More than one iteration of the service bus may be expected, in part to optimize the electrical and mechanical performance, in part because of uncertainties of the front-end powering (serial powering or DC-DC), and in part because of evolving specifications for the sensor HV multiplexing.

Figure 12: Build up and impedance calculation for the stave bus cable.

### End-of-Substructure Card

The End-Of-Substructure (EoS) Card is the interface between the Stave/Petals or Super-Modules with the off-detector electronics. The EoS Schematics are common; however, the layout will differ according to the geometrical requirements in the barrel and end-cap substructures. The detailed implementation of the EoS card critically depends on the choices made for the LV distribution scheme (DC-DC or Serial powering) and the HV distribution system. In addition, the DCS integration of the EoS is currently still evolving.

The EoS will host a GBTx serializer/deserializer and a Versatile Link transceiver VTRx. For the incoming TTC optical links the optical-to-electrical conversion is performed by the VTRx. The data is deserialised by the GBTx. The 40 MHz clock, the 40 Mbits/s Level-1 trigger and the control data are all distributed to the HCCs on the modules. The 160 Mbits/s data from each HCC are serialized by the GBTx and converted to optical by the VTRx. Thus, each EoS requires at least one pair of VTRx and GBTx and two optical fibers. If it is decided to employ redundancy, duplication of these components will be required. Part of the DCS information will be handled by the GBTSCA chip. The EoS will also host filters for the LV/HV plus a possible HV control unit. Finally it will host a series of temperature, humidity, voltage and current sensors that will provide inputs to the DCS via the GBTSCA chip.

#### 3.4.1 Interlocking Scheme

For the DCS & Interlock scheme, an entirely independent scheme is not feasible due to cabling constraints. To ensure detector safety an independent set of hardware interlocks will nevertheless be necessary. In order to minimize the number of dedicated cables required, the interlock will be based on two redundant temperature readings on the outlet of the cooling pipes for each substructure. Temperature readings from the modules will be made available in the data stream through the HCC. Additional temperature and humidity data will be fed into the GBTx so that high granularity DCS data will be available. As an additional safety feature, FE ASICs could have a scheme in which they sense temperature and power off automatically if they detect the temperature being above a defined threshold.

#### 3.4.2 I/O, Cables and Connectors

For the DCS we foresee to have a least three digital I/O channels to control each module, leading to at least 48 digital I/Os alone on the GBTSCA. In terms of logical cable units, each EoS has one LV and one HV cable, the high speed fiber link plus the external DCS information.

## 4 Material Considerations

### Single-sided Modules (Steaves and Petals)

Based on the current module [9] design for the ABCN13, a material budget estimate has been made of the barrel module.1 End-cap modules will be similar with the differences due to the fractional coverage of the sensors by the hybrids in the various rings. Assuming a 320 \(\mu\)m thick sensor, this yields a predicted radiation length for short barrel and long barrel modules of 0.55% and 0.44%, respectively. Figure 13 shows the fractional contributions for the different materials to a module. As the sensor dominates the material, the single-sided modules has been well optimized to minimize material. Further reductions are unlikely as the second largest contributor to the radiation length is copper. Reducing the copper's thickness could affect the hybrid's yield. Hatching the copper area may cause unacceptable voltage drops and/or noise increases.

The resulting hybrid is 15 mm\(\times\)98 mm and has 3 metal layers. Based on the current prototype hybrids using the ABCn25, we estimate a bare hybrid will be 0.11% of a radiation length (\(X_{0}\)) and its components (ASICs, SMDs, solder, and epoxies) is 0.1% \(X_{0}\) averaged over the module. The total radiation length of a stave is estimated to be under 2%, including the stave core, cooling pipes, bus tapes and modules.

### Super-Module Material

The material for the super-module was also based on an extrapolation of the current prototype modules. Using the ABCn130, the radiation length of one of the hybrid's legs (10 ASICs), including flex-circuit layers and CC-bridge and electrical components (SMDs and ASICs) is estimated to 0.17% X\({}_{0}\) equivalent radiation lengths (normalized to the sensor area). A double-sided silicon module, with two u-shaped hybrids, connectors, a 300 \(\mu\)m-thick CC-bridge, TPG base-board and aluminum-nitride facing would represent about 1.7% X\({}_{0}\) improving by about 30% the total radiation length for the current module.

The total radiation length of a super-module, including the modules, the local support, and the mechanical and electrical services, is estimated to be between 2.15% X\({}_{0}\) and 2.25% X\({}_{0}\) depending on the detailed design choices.

## 5 Module Production

### Stave/Petal Modules

Stave and Petal modules are very similar and in the current design the same production steps are planned. The main difference will be the geometry of the different tools. For the petal modules a new set of tools have been adapted from the stave tooling. The construction of a full module follows the following procedure:

1. ASICs are glued onto hybrids
2. ASICs are wire bonded to hybrids
3. Hybrids are tested electrically (HSIO based DAQ tests e.g. timing, gain, noise, etc.)
4. Hybrids are glued onto sensors

Figure 13: Fractional contributions for different materials to the radiation length of the barrel modules. Left: Short Barrel. Right: Long Barrel.

5. ASICs are wire bonded onto sensors
6. Full module is tested

The reduced number of steps in the assembly and bonding should improve module throughput and reduce length of the quality assurance chain. Within the module, location precisions between the ASICs, bare hybrids and sensors are much more relaxed as it is set by what is wire bondable (\(\sim 200\)\(\mu\)m); the high precision action is the attachment of the modules to the stave cores. As such, all ASICs can be placed relative to their cut edges simultaneously using custom vacuum tools, which easily meet the needed precision. In addition, systems using dowel pins for module assembly can be utilized, which can be mass-produced cheaply.

#### 5.1.1 ASIC to Hybrid Gluing

The details of the ASIC to hybrid gluing process are depicted in Figure 14. Several tools are used for this process. Initially chips are aligned in a mask made up of a precision, laser-cut stencil and plastic tray, as shown in Figure 14 a. After being picked up with a vacuum pickup tool, as shown on Figure 14 b, the silver epoxy (Traduct 2902) is distributed onto the ASICs with another \(120\)\(\mu\)m thick, laser cut stencil which acts as a glue mask that is attached onto the pickup tool. Figure 14 d shows the resulting glue spots. As the last gluing step, the chips are lowered onto the hybrid. The x-y alignment is set by precision holes in the hybrid panel and pins in the pickup tool. The silver epoxy thickness of \(80\)\(\mu\)m is set by 4 precision jacks in the pickup tool referenced to the ASIC locations by 4 landing pads on the panel. The pickup tool is left until the glue has set, weighted by a brass block. Setting times are at the order of 6-12 hours. After the glue has set, the chips are wire bonded to the hybrid, followed by a set of electrical qualification tests of the final object.

#### 5.1.2 Hybrids to Sensors

The hybrid to sensor gluing process is depicted in Figure 15. Several further tools are used for this process. Electronics grade epoxy (fuller Epolite 5313) is applied to the back side of the hybrids using a

second 200 \(\mu\)m thick, laser cut glue stencil mask, shown on Figure 15 a. The hybrids are placed onto the sensor using the same vacuum pickup tools as used for the ASIC to hybrid gluing and left weighted down to set for another 6-12 hours. The hybrid placement in x-y is set by pins in the pickup tool locating into holes in the module assembly plate. The final 120 \(\mu\)m glue thickness is set by the 4 jacks in the pickup tool landing of ground pedestals on the assembly jig. The targeted glue coverage of \(\sim\)60% allows for the variation of the hybrid's and applied glue layer's thicknesses and of the hybrid's flatness, while still supporting the relevant areas for wire bonding and ASIC cooling. An example of the resulting glue spots is shown (using a glass sensor dummy) in Figure 15. Once more, after the glue has set, the readout pads of the ASICs are connected to the strip pads and further electrical quality control steps are performed.

#### 5.1.3 Finalized Module

A nearly fully bonded full barrel module is shown in Figure 16.

The green frame in which the module rests is used for connecting the module to power and readout for qualification tests. These tests include e.g. calibrations, gain and noise measurements. Typical values of noise with the 250 nm prototype barrel

modules are 400 ENC before the strips are connected to the readout channels and, due to the added capacitance, 590-620 ENC after the connection is made depending on the hybrid coverage.

### Double-Sided Modules

The main stages of the assembly sequence of a double-sided silicon strip module are described below. More details can be found in [10]. The different jigs used during the assembly are explained in section 6.2.

1. Base-board and facings assembly: A rectangular Teflon piece with a single linear vacuum channel is fixed on top of each far-end of the base-board assembly plate. The four alignment pins located in the corners of the base-plate are used to drive auxiliary jigs at different stages of the module assembly. Two AlN facings are positioned to the plungers over the Teflon pieces and vacuum is applied to avoid displacements. Glue (Araldite 2011) is dispensed to the facings. The TPG base-board is laid on top of the facings by means of the four guiding pins. Two other AlN facings are held with vacuum on two independent vacuum chucks. Each chuck contains the same Teflon structure as in the base-board assembly plate so that all four module facings are identical. The vacuum chucks are inserted into the alignment pins of the base-plate (Fig. 17a). Vacuum is applied to press the facings to the base-board while glue-curing.
2. Assembly of high-voltage tongue to sensors A silicon detector is placed (back-plane facing up) on a detector vacuum chuck by aligning two of the sensor edges to three alignment pins. Vacuum is applied to hold the detector and the high-voltage tongue assembly jig is inserted into the chuck by means of two guiding pins. The _s-shaped_ tongue is positioned (Fig. 17b) and glued with Araldite-2011 (electrically non-conductive). After removal of the assembly jig, the electrical connection to the sensor back-plane is made with four low-height wire-bonds.
3. Detector assembly The assembly of the detectors to the TPG base-board is the same for both sensors. A 100 \(\upmu\)m-thick mask with a glue pattern is distributed over the base-board between the facings and fixed with kapton tapes before spreading the glue (Fig. 17c). The pattern provides a good glue coverage for most of the sensor area while avoiding the edges and ensures the required fixation of the sensor (and in particular under the bond-pads) that avoids difficulties during wire-bonding operations. The second detector, with the HV-tongue already bonded to the back-plane, is transferred to the base-board and pressed against it. After curing during 24 hours at room temperature, the set is ready and IV-characteristics are measured for both sensors.
4. Hybrid assembly The complete set of base-board and sensors is transferred to the hybrid assembly plate. The T-shaped hybrid placement jig is positioned on top of one sensor by means of two guiding pins. Glue is dispensed to the the CC feet of the bridge the main flex sits on and two hybrids are aligned with respect to their edges to the placement jig. The hybrid pressing jigs are put in place so that to press both ends of the hybrids to the facings (Figs. 17d). After glue curing, the set is turned upside-down and the other two remaining hybrids are assembled the same way.
5. Wire-bondingThe module is transfered to the multi-purpose holding box for bonding. The chip-to-hybrid and the chip-to-sensor wire-bonds are made using with standard 25 \(\upmu\)m Al-Si(1%) wire. Due to the presence of the CC-bridge underneath the hybrid flex, the wire-bonds to the sensor may reach several milimeters-height. Each of the 40 ABCN-13 chips of the module is bonded with a unique address.

## 6 Assembly, Bonding and Testing Tooling

### Single-Sided Modules

A number of special tools are needed for the module assembly step described in Section 5.1.

Here only the most important tools will be shown, a complete list of the tools including the drawings can be found in [11].

* The _Chip Tray_(Figure 18a) is a laminate of a stainless steel laser cut stencil and a plastic tray. The cut-outs place the ASICs in within 50 \(\mu\)m on the ideal position. The position accuracy is limited by the accuracy of the ASIC cut edge, but it is well within the needed tolerance.
* The _Hybrid Pickup Tool_ (Figure 18b) is a plastic, metal laminate as well. Two pins are used to position the tool in x-y relative to the chip tray, ASIC glue masks, hybrid panels, and module assembly tool. Four metal jacks are used to set glue thicknesses during ASIC attachment and module assembly. The final tool will most likely has a anodized aluminum contact face to improve glue thickness precision and stability of the jig.
* The _8-way Vacuum Jig_ (Figure 18c) has 8 independent vacuum areas (one for each hybrid in the panel). It is used during ASIC attachment, hybrid wire bonding and during hybrid testing.

Figure 17: Basic set of jigs used for the assembly of double-sided strip modules.

* The _ASIC Glue Mask_ (Figure 18d) is made up of a laser cut, stainless steel glue mask and an outer frame which stiffens/ruggedizes the mask. It sets the amount and location of the silver epoxy between the ASICs and hybrids. The glue mask is aligned to the hybrid pickup tool by a two holes.
* Sensors and hybrids are glued together using the _Module Assembly Plate_ (Figure 19a). Sensors are positioned relative its cut edges by 3 precision pins. The sensor is vacuumed to the assembly plate by a series of vacuum holes. Hybrids are placed in x-y relative to sensor by 4 holes in the plate. The hybrid-to-sensor glue thickness is set by 8 ground pin surfaces places in brass inserts.
* The electronics grade epoxy thickness is set and is located in x-y by the_Module Glue Mask_ (Figure 19b). The module glue mask is a third laser cut, stainless steel sheet which is located to the hybrid by 2 holes in the mask.
* The _Module Bonding Plate_ (Figure 19c) is a simplified module assembly plate without the sensor locating pins. During bonding between the sensor and ASICs and between the module and frame, the module is held in place by a set of vacuum holes.
* The _Module Testing Plate_ (Figure 19d) is the final jig used in single module testing. It consists of two pieces of aluminum and two isolating inserts (one peek and one kapton). During testing, the module is vacuumed to the jig with a set of vacuum holes. The top plate provides the high voltage. The bottom plate provides the cooling with a water-glycol channel. This part of the plate is held at ground.
* Modules are testing in PCB_Module Test Frame_ (Figure 19e and 19f) which provides the traces and connections between the hybrids, DAQ system, and power supplies. The PCB frames provide a cheap, flexible test bed for the different powering (serial powering [12] and DC-DC converters [13]), shielding and grounding configurations under consideration.

### Double-Sided Modules

A set of jigs has been developed to assemble the DSM prototypes (see Fig. 20). Tight mechanical tolerances were not required for these prototypes as proving the electrical performance of the double-sided module concept was the main focus. As such, the jigs have been produced following a design that is simple and low cost. More stringent alignment precisions during the module assembly can however be achieved easily with minor modifications of these jigs.

* The _base-board assembly plate_ (Fig. 20a) consists of an aluminum plate with two linear vacuum grooves, four alignment plungers and four guiding pins. The plate is used to position and glue one side of the TPG base-board to two AlN facings. Two additional identical vacuum chucks will put in place the two remaining facings on top of the base-board.
* Two _detector vacuum chucks_ (see an example in Fig. 20b) are used to hold with vacuum the sensors while assembling them onto the TPG base-board. Each chuck consists in a Teflon plate bolted on top of an aluminum plate. In both cases, a series of vacuum holes pull the sensors onto the Teflon plate. Three alignment pins are used to place the detector with respect to its cut edges. Six holes, three on each side with respect to chuck center, are used to hold plungers to align the base-board and facings to the sensor. One of the chucks has two additional vacuum channels to fix the facings while assembling one of the module sides. Lastly, two alignment pins are used to place one chuck on top of the other while sandwiching the set of silicon detectors, facings and base-board. An additional different chuck is used to assemble the high-voltage tongue to each sensor.
* The hybrids are positioned with a special _placement jig_ (Fig. 20c) which is longitudinally aligned with the sensor central axis. Once a first module side has been completed, it is transferred to a _hybrids assembly plate_, an aluminum plate very similar to the base-board assembly plate with two large symmetric apertures that provide the required space for the front-end electronics. The _hybrids pressing jigs_ (Fig. 20d) are used to press the hybrids against the facings while glue-curing.
* After assembly, the module is stored in a _multi-purpose holding box_. The box is also used as

bonding jig, and thus it remains a very convenient container to store and transport the module before, during and after bonding operations.

## 7 Performance

Using the ABCN25 front-end chip, the electrical performance has been studied in single-module and multi-module configurations for single-sided and double-sided barrel modules. The electrical performance of 4-module single-sided stavelets has been studied using both serial power and DC-DC converters for the front-end electronics [17], and up to 7 double-sided modules have been operated satisfactorily together in an electrical super-module using DC-DC converters [5]. Furthermore, single irradiated modules of both types have been shown to operate satisfactorily.

The noise performance of the final system can be estimated using inputs from the sensor working group [14], the geometry of the silicon sensors for the different barrel layers and end-cap rings, the estimated maximum fluences at end-of-lifetime [15], the estimated maximum sensor temperature at the end-of-lifetime, and the measured performance of the 130 nm ABCn front-end from a MPW submission [16]. For this calculation, all effects introduced by low-voltage powering method, multi-module and other environmental influences are assumed to be negligible. In the stave and petal modules, gluing

directly on the sensor face adds two additional sources of load capacitance. The glue increases the inter-strip capacitance; this increase has been measured to be \(\sim 0.3\) pF per centimeter of coverage with the glue Epolite 5313. The close proximity of the hybrid ground also added to the load capacitance; it can be modeled as a parallel-plate capacitor partially filled with dielectric (the hybrid's solder resist and the epoxy attaching the hybrid to the sensor. This calculation has been cross-checked with measurements of 250 nm prototype modules and is consistent to better than \(\sim 10\%\). By gluing directly to the sensor surfaces, the total load capacitance (inter-strip plus hybrid ground) is increased by 10-20% depending on the geometry of the sensor and hybrid.

All strip lengths in the LOI have been calculated, with indicative sections of the end cap modules shown in the tables. For super-modules, the noise performance will be the same as stave module sections without hybrids.

From these inputs, the expected collected charge, load capacitance, leakage current, and noise after irradiation have been determined, shown in a table Figure 21. For efficient tracking, it has been shown that the signal-to-noise (S/N) has be larger than 10:1 with the signal-to-threshold larger than 2.2:1. All layers and rings have a predicted signal-to-noise of greater than 14:1 at the end-of-lifetime. As long as a threshold of 0.75 fC, the electrical performance with respect to signal efficiency and noise occupancy will be more than sufficient at end of lifetime. The ABCn250 can run stably with a threshold of 0.5 fC.

The performance estimated above could be degraded further by additional noise sources. From studies of stavelets with ABCn25 using serial power and DC-DC converters, two additional effects have been noted. The noise on stave is slightly elevated (by \(\sim 5\%\)) relative to single-module test with both serial power and DC-DC converters [17]. Some sensitivity to double trigger effects which limit the minimum threshold has also been seen using serial powering, but have been controlled by changing the segmentation of the the SP chain from single hybrids to modules. Both symptoms are fairly well understood and new stavelets with ABCn25 are in process which include features to address these issues [18]. The

noise and double trigger (DT)2 noise can only be truly evaluated with the first prototype ABCn130 as the operating voltages and currents will be lower and the digital section of the ASIC will change significantly. As the S/N for single modules is predicted to be greater than \(16:1\), there can be an optimization between increased noise in a multi-module system and material using in shielding and powering, as long as minimum usable threshold is unaffected above \(0.5\) fC.

Footnote 2: The double trigger noise probes coherent noise effects by sending two triggers. The second trigger is stepped through the trigger and readout cycle of the first trigger and the noise at each step is calculated.

## 8 Conclusions

In this report the module designs for single sided and double sided modules for the ATLAS Silicon Strip Upgrade are presented. It was shown that both module types with well developed and would provide the performance necessary for the final system at the end of lifetime. Cable and End-Of-Substrucuc cards have also been described which will provide the LV and HV power, data i/o, clock and DCS connectivity between the modules and the global infrastructure.
