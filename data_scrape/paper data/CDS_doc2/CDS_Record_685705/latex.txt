###### Abstract

The layout and module geometry of the Liquid-Argon Hadronic End-Cap Calorimeter

and its digitisation are described. The description has been done in DICE-95 framework[1].

(HSHP), interleaved by the liquid argon gaps (HLAR). The first plate in each wheel, encoded as HFPL, also consists of copper, is 1/2 of thickness of ordinary one ( 2.5 cm and 5.0 cm for inner and outer wheels, respectively).

## 4 Hadronic Endcap \(\eta\)-granularity.

The module is divided into radial blocks ( denoted as HETA ) with boundaries calculated according \(\eta\) values which are corresponds to actual \(\eta\) granularity of the calorimeter. The typical tree structure of the HETA branch is presented in fig. 6

## 5 The individual liquid-argon gap.

The liquid-argon gap between two subsequent shower plates is the sensitive volume with thickness 0.85 cm. Inside this sensitive volume the three kapton plates are inserted, encoded as HKAP. The thickness of these kapton foils, on which the sensitive electronics would be glued, is 300 \(\mu\) for Padboard and 100 \(mu\) for EST boards, as considering at present.

The z - view of the one liquid-argon gap is shown at fig. 7

## 6 Materials in HEND.

One of the important characteristics of geometry description is a correct material distribution in code. To check it, the material distribution in absorption lengths vs \(\eta\) is plotted in fig. 8. This distribution was performed by geantino scan.

## 7 Access to digits.

Due to possibility in DICE95 to have different bins and the limits for digits in different places of the same logical detector[2], this feature was implemented in HENDDIG module.

Example for the HEND calorimeter:

 Fill HDIG! Digitization parameters  Version =1! Version  Scale =1.e6! ADC scale factor  EMax =100! Max energy  EtalMx =3.3! Rapidity limit  DEta =0.05! Finest eta granularity  DPhi =2*pi/64! Phi granularity
* do i = 1,8  if (mod(i,2)!= 0) then "wheel outer part"  DIGI HENN type=i:4:,  Eta:hdig_DEta:(1.5,1.8),  phi:hdig_dphi:(0,TwoPi),  Eloss:0:Calo(0,hdig_EMax)  else if (mod(i,2)== 0) then "wheel inner part"  DIGI HENN type=i:4:,  Eta:hdig_DEta*2:(1.8,3.3),  phi:hdig_dphi:(0,TwoPi),  Eloss:0:Calo(0,hdig_EMax)  end if  end do
*

The /ittype parameter in DIGI statement is used as a switch between different DIGI parameters for different homogeneous parts of calorimeter.

The full text of HENDDIG routine is included in this note.

## 8 Summary.

The Liquid-Argon Hadronic Calorimeter GEANT geometry description and digitisation procedure in DICE95 standard has been created.
