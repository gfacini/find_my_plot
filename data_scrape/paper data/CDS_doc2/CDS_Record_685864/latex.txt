**Proposal to Study a Revised Inner Tracker Layout for ATLAS**

**A.G.Clark and G.N.Taylor**

**Introduction**

In this paper we propose an optimisation of the layout of the ATLAS inner detector. Important aspects of the current "Cosener's House" design are maintained whilst some perceived shortcomings are removed. In particular, it is proposed to study a design with the barrel TRT consolidated into one unit, and moved to the outermost radius. All the precision tracker (silicon) layers would then be placed inside the inner radius of the TRT.

The reasons behind this suggestion include:

* simplifying the mechanical design
* reducing the occupation in the TRT
* matching detector resolution with appropriate radial position in the barrel (within cost limitations)
* reducing the number of interfaces between difference sub-detectors and the inherent dead material associated with these interfaces.

Some ideas for the improving the transition region between the barrel and the endcap are presented.

Although specific dimensions are given, they are intended to be starting values for the necessary Monte Carlo optimization which will follow.

**Silicon Tracking at High Luminosity**

The outer layers of the silicon tracker are required to provide robust tracking at full luminosity, whilst being able to survive the radiation levels expected over a 10 year period of ATLAS operation. Calculations of the expected radiation suggests that operation of silicon detectors may be possible beyond a radius of approximately 50cm.

In the present design a layer with 20\(\upmu\)m resolution at a radius of 30cm has been found to be important in several aspects of pattern recognition and track fitting. The radiation levels expected at this radius are 2-3 times higher than at 50cm radius. We propose studying the effect of moving this layer to a radius where safer operating conditions are expected. The performance of the inner tracker with this layer moved out as far as a radius of 40cm should be investigated.

Maintaining the resolution of this layer at 20\(\upmu\)m and increasing the radius by 33% results in an increase in silicon area and channel count. Studies of the effect of increasing the element size of this layer should thus also be carried out.

The remainder of the outer silicon is to be placed in the region from about 50cm radius to the inner radius of the barrel TRT. The larger this radius the better for the performance of the silicon tracking.

### Barrel TRT Dimension

The following analysis suggests that pushing the barrel TRT inner radius to approximately 72-74cm will maintain the TR performance of the barrel TRT as currently described in the Cosener's house design. The overall tracking performance of the combined silicon/TRT tracking is also expected to be maintained.

The literature would suggest that an approximate scaling rule exists for the pion rejection factor for TR detectors -- removing 10cm from the total length of the TRD (radiator and detector elements combined) decreases the pion rejection by a factor of 5.

Considering results from RD6 [1, 2] for pion probability at 90% electron identification efficiency, and \(\eta\)=0, the scaling rule is seen to be observed (see figure 1, points label A, B).

The total thickness of the TRT in the barrel at \(\eta\)=0 in the current design is 42cm. Extrapolating to this thickness leads to point C. However, this 42cm is split into two sections of 21cm each in the current design, resulting in a reduction of the pion rejection by a factor of two (point D). Maintaining the resulting rejection ratio (approximately 16), but moving back on the "single TRD" line ends at point E, corresponding to a radius of approximately 38cm.

Finally, in view of the very high expected occupancy it has been suggested that the straw diameter in the TRT be reduced from 4mm to 3.5mm. Maintaining the same radiator, this reduces the TRT radial thickness by a further 2cm, since there are 40 straws in the radial direction.

Thus it could be expected that a single barrel TRT of approximately 36cm thickness should have the same TR performance as the current Cosener's House design.

Maintaining 40 straws radially, each 3.5mm in diameter, this design would allow 0.56cm radiator between straws in the radial direction. Reduced from approximately 0.68cm in the current design, the smaller radiator will be offset by the single barrel design and the reduced occupancy. With the TRT at the outermost radius available the occupancy is considerably reduced and the performance at high luminosity is expected to be better than that of the Cosener's House design.

It is proposed to move the outer radius to at least 110cm, with the possibility of an even greater outer radius. Detailed mechanics considerations of this region of the tracker, will also be required before such an increase in the TRT outer radius can be assumed. However, it has been shown that removing the moderator from the central barrel region (lzl < 100cm), results in a small increase (20-30%) in the calculated radiation damage in the outer silicon layers [3].

Thus additional radial space for the TRT could well be found at the outer radius.

Although the _stand alone_ tracking performance of the TRT in the current proposal is slightly worsened by the reduced radial spacing, this effect is somewhat off-set by the smaller straw diameter and reduced occupancy. However the combination of the silicon and TRT will together cover the same radial projection, thus their combined track momentum error will not change significantly.

**Proposal**

It is proposed therefore that a solution be studied where the barrel TRT is consolidated in the region approximately 74cm<x<110+cm.

It is also proposed that the current 30cm radius silicon layer be moved out to a radius of approximately 40cm.

The remaining outer silicon layers, having larger element size, would consist of 2 pairs of \(\phi\)-,z-layers at approximate radii 50 and 70cm, with an additional \(\phi\)-layer at a radius of approximately 60cm. (If the operation of the 40cm radius layer cannot be guaranteed due to radiation damage, a further z-layer will be required at larger radius.)

Preliminary dimensions for this arrangement are shown table 1. A diagram of the proposed layout is shown in figure 2, alongside the current design.

**Changes to Current Cost Estimates**

The change in the number of TRT channels will be insignificant in the total costing.

The current design has 5 layers of silicon at radii greater than 50cm. The proposed design maintains 5 layers in this region, with a total area that is reduced from 44.2m\({}^{2}\) in the Cosener's House design to 36.3m\({}^{2}\). Being at lower radii it is necessary to reduce the \(\phi\)-element size. The total channel count with 150\(\mu\)m \(\phi\) segmentation is approximately the same as the Coseners House design. Thus a reduction of approximately 1.2MCHF results from the reduced silicon area (assuming 15CHF per cm\({}^{2}\), which will need verification.)

In the proposed 40cm radius layer, the element size is expected to be maintained as it is for the 30cm radius layer in the current design. Thus the area and number of channels in this layer is increased from the Cosener's House design by 33%. The cost of this layer thus increases from 6.77MCHF to 9.03MCHF, a difference of 2.26MCHF. If the simulations show that the element size of this layer can be reduced, a cost reduction could be foreseen. For costing over ten years of operation, it is important to understand the survivability of this layer, even at the larger radius of 40cm.

The total cost increase for the silicon detectors is thus approximately 1MCHF, with the important high resolution layer in a considerably safer position in terms of radiation damage.

**Transition Region**

The transition between the barrel and forward trackers needs careful optimisation but here we provide information on two possible options.

The "single barrel TRT" design, with all silicon layers in the inner region of the barrel makes the addition of the "transition TRT modules" very restrictive. We prefer to consider designs without these modules.

The first alternative is to simply keep the barrel region defined by the z-boundary as in the Cosener's House design with no transition modules(figs. 2, 3). The design maintains good tracking characteristics across the transition region, but would lack good TR performance in the cone defined approximately by 0.9<\(\eta\)|<1.1 This design is the simplest and maintains the all important tracking ability.

A more complex design would aim to extend the barrel TRT in order to provide the same \(\eta\)-coverage as the precision trackers. However, because of the length required to do this, the barrel TRT would need to be split. The optimal split would be at right angles to the tracks in the non-bending planes. One possibility which provides good tracking throughout the transition region, whilst improving the TR chracterisitics from the simple design above is shown in figure 4. A module at approximately 45\({}^{\rm o}\) angle consists of a large TRD volume followed by a complete MSGC module to provide a space point. At larger z the current forward tracker remains. Two partial discs of MSGC are added in the transition region to give extra points on tracks not intercepting all the silicon barrel layers.

Optimization of such a layout needs consideration of many effects, especially the space requirements for electronics and services.

**Vertex Detectors**

The high precision silicon/pixel layers are left in the present proposals as in the Cosener's House design. Tracking at high luminosity most not rely on these layers due to the radiation levels expected.

**Summary**

A proposal is made to study a simplified and more coherent barrel tracker. In this proposal a single barrel TRD module is used with precision tracking detectors kept within the inner radius of the barrel TRT volume.

This design has the potential of providing good coverage for central tracking, is mechanically simpler and places the straws of the TRD at greater radii for recued straw occupancy.

The design allows for precision layers needed for high luminosity to be placed at radii greater than 40cm, an important aspect for radiation damage in the silicon detectors.

In addition to this simple re-arrangement of the barrel region, a possible improvement to the transition region bewteen the barrel and forward detectors is suggested.

**FORWARD JET TAGGING IN HEAVY HIGGS PRODUCTION AT THE LHC**

V.V. Zmushko

IHEP, Serpukhov, Russia

The process

\[qq\to qqH\to qqZZ, \tag{1}\]

gives at large \(M_{H}\) and LHC energies approximately the same contribution to the Higgs production as the process

\[gg\to H\to ZZ. \tag{2}\]

Tagging a single forward jet in the process (1) leads to the suppression of the background caused by the QCD nonresonance Z7-pairs [1]. Once the Higgs will be discovered, the separation of the process (1) allows also to study the VVH coupling and the scattering of the longitudinal vector bosons.

In Ref. [1] a parton level study has been made with the exactly calculated amplitudes for the process\({}_{qq}\to qqZZ\). The work [1] was done for SSC. A goal of this work is to consider in case LHC a possibility of the jets tagging by a forward calorimeter with rather rough granularity \(\Delta_{\mu}\times\Delta_{\phi}=0.5\times 0.5\), as it was suggested in Ref. [2]. The \(H\to 4l\) (\(l=e,\mu\)) and \(H\to ll\nu\nu\) decay modes are considered only.

For calculations the ISAJET program (version 6.36) is used. The full matrix elements of (1) are not included in the ISAJET program. For Higgs production the \(VV\to H\to VV\) and \(VV\to VV\) amplitudes are taken into account only. The vector bosons are appear from a quark bremsstrahlung in the parton cascade. In order to estimate the efficiency of the jet reconstructing algorithm the results are compared with the parton level calculations.

For the parton level calculations for LHC the ISAJET program is also used. The partons from the parton cascades with \(Q^{2}>0\) and the maximum \(\rm{pr}\) are chosen for the tagging. Then as for the particle jets from two partons with \(2<|\eta|<5\) we use one that have the maximum energy.

It is supposed that the forward calorimeters will have the coverage \(3<|\eta|<5\). The coverage is enlarged by using the end cup calorimeters with the running parameters. For all calorimeters the granularity is \(\Delta_{\pi}\times\Delta_{\phi}=0.5\times 0.5\) and the energy resolutions are \((\Delta F/F)_{\gamma m}=20\%/\sqrt{E}\) and \((\Delta F/E)_{n}=100\%/\sqrt{E}\). For the forward calorimeter the cell size will be compatible with the hadronic shower size. As it was shown in Ref. [1] the hadronic shower size for the calorimeter granularity \(\Delta>0.2\) has small influence on the reconstruction of the jets in the forward calorimeter. Therefore for calorimeter simulation the shower size is not taken into account.

To search the Higgs boson with high mass the luminosity up to \(2^{+}10^{34}~{}cm^{-+}s^{-}\) is needed. At this luminosity there are about 20 inelastic pp interactions in each bunch crossing. We mixed the considered event with \(n_{MB}\) MINIBIAS-events and \(n_{T}\) TWOJET events with \(p_{T}^{jet}>3~{}GeV/c\) in order to simulate the pile-up. The quantities \(n_{MB}\) and \(n_{T}\) were Poisson simulated with the average value of 10. _MC scale effects measured from a hard object: \(\sigma_{\rm{tot}}\)-up_.

The typical transverse energy distributions for tagged jets in the calorimeter are shown in Fig. 1. The jets are reconstructed with the help of the cluster algorithm [1]. The cell with maximum \(E_{T}\) was chosen, then the connected set of the cells with \(E_{T}^{\rm{eff}}>E_{T}^{\rm{eff}}\) forms the cluster. The value \(E_{T}^{\rm{eff}}\) is taken from the condition \(E_{T}^{\rm{eff}}>E_{T}^{\rm{eff}}>\). For the Higgs and QCD background events with pile-up \(<E_{T}^{\rm{eff}}>\) is equal about \(5~{}GeV/c\) and \(E_{T}^{\rm{eff}}=10~{}GeV/c\).

The analysis is carried out for the Higgs mass \(M_{\mu}-\) and \(GeV\) and the t quark mass \(m_{t}=140~{}GeV\). The leptons are assumed to be measured with 100% efficiency. We have put the cuts for the 41 channel on the Z transverse momenta, pseudorapidity and ZZ invariant mass:

\[p_{T}^{Z}>\frac{1}{\gamma}\sqrt{M_{Z\,g}^{2}-4M_{Z}^{2}},\quad|\eta_{Z}|<2.5, \quad M_{ZZ}>500~{}GeV \tag{3}\]

and for the \(ll\nu\) channel the cuts on the transverse momentum and the pseudorapidity of the reconstructed from \(l^{+}l^{-}\) Z, and the missing transverse momentum:

\[p_{T}^{Z-\mu}>150~{}GeV/c,\quad|\eta^{2-\mu}|<2.5,\quad p_{T}^{miss}>150~{}GeV/c. \tag{4}\]

Since in this case the precision of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) measurement is not important, \(p_{T}^{miss}=p_{T}^{\rm{eff}}\) is taken. For the \(\eta\) coverage \(|\eta|<5\) the cut \(p_{T}^{miss}>150~{}GeV/c\)is sufficient to suppress the background from the process \(pp\to Z+jets\) [3]. The \(p_{T}\) cuts are chosen relatively small in order to save a shape of the \(p_{T}^{2}-^{11}\) and \(M_{T}^{2\,\pi}\) spectra.

Fig. 2 and 1 show the energy distribution of the tagged jet for 41 and \(W\nu\nu\) channels, respectively (the hadron level calculation of the QCD background has been made only for 41 channel). For \(VV\cdots\)\(H\) events the curves of the parton and hadron level calculations are coincide for \(E_{j}>1000\)\(GeV\). The QCD background events give somewhat greater number of jets because of the fake jets in low \(p_{T}\). The background may be suppressed further, if the cut on \(p_{T}\) of jets is imposed ( Table 1 ). Mass distributions of Z pairs before and after jet tagging for 41 events are shown in Fig. 3. The numbers of signal and background events expected at the LHC with an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\) are presented in Table 1. It can be seen that in this case it is not profitable in terms of statistical significance to use tagging for Higgs search. The decay mode \(H=ll\nu\nu\) has branching ratio six times larger than the decay to 41. In the \(ll\nu\nu\) channel the signal may be searched as a Jacobian peak in the \(p_{T}^{2\,\pi-l}\) distribution or in the transverse mass distribution, \(m_{T}^{2\,\pi}\)[3]. These distribution are shown in Fig. 5 and 6, respectively. In both cases the signal is clearly visible for the tagged events.

Thus, the forward calorimeter with rough granularity \(\Delta_{\eta}\times\Delta_{\phi}=0.5\times 0.5\) is useful for the jet tagging. The considered here single jet tagging can be used to enhance the Higgs signal in the \(ll\nu\nu\) channel.
