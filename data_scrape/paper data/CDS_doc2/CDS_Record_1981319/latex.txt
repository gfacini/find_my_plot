Introduction

The modelling of final state particles in events where top quarks are produced is one of the major systematic uncertainties in measurements of top quark cross sections and of top quark properties in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV at the LHC collider. Since top quark pair production is one of the major backgrounds for Higgs measurements and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, these analyses would also benefit from a better understanding of \(t\bar{t}\) modelling.

In this note predictions of various Monte Carlo (MC) generators are compared to data. Section 2 gives a short description of the MC samples presented in this note and Section 3 gives a brief summary of the data measurements that the MC samples are compared against. Section 4 presents the studies using Powheg\(+\)Pythia6 samples, where the scale parameters as well as the used Parton Distribution Function (PDF) sets are varied and compared to unfolded ATLAS data using the Rivet framework. Afterwards, Section 5 presents more studies where the \(t\bar{t}\) Powheg\(+\)Pythia6 sample is compared with new next-to-leading order (NLO) generator setups, Powheg\(+\)Pythia8 and MadGraph5\(\_\)AMC@NLO+Herwig\(++\), and also with ATLAS data using the Rivet framework as in the previous section. Finally, in Section 6 the conclusions of the studies discussed in this note are shown.

All studies are performed either at parton level or at particle level using MC samples. The studies in this note are relevant to TOP LHC Working Group discussions on top quark event modelling.

## 2 Sample and object definitions

The MC generator samples discussed in this note are presented in this section. A summary of the generator settings is available in Table 1.

* The Powheg\(+\)Pythia6, P2011C sample is generated using the Powheg NLO generator [1, 2, 3] (revision 2330, version 3.0) with the NLO CT10 [4] PDF. An NLO matrix element (ME) is used for the \(t\bar{t}\) hard scattering process. The \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) factor, which is the model parameter that controls ME/Parton Shower (PS) matching in Powheg and effectively regulates the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) radiation, is set to the top quark mass, i.e. 172.5 GeV. The default value used by most Run 1 analyses corresponds to \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=\infty\). The PS and the underlying event (UE) are simulated using Pythia6[5] (version 6.427) with Perugia 2011C tune [6] and the corresponding leading order (LO) CTEQ6L1 [7]. The hard process (renormalisation \(\mu_{r}\) and factorisation \(\mu_{f}\)) scales are set to the generator default value \(\mu\) that is defined by: \[\mu=\sqrt{m_{\mathrm{top}}^{2}+p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}},\] (1) where \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are the top quark mass and the top quark transverse momentum, evaluated for the underlying Born configuration (i.e. before radiation). Additional samples are produced to estimate the effect of more or less radiation, considering variations on the \(\mu_{f}\) and \(\mu_{r}\) scales as well as variations on the used \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) value as shown in Section 4. These scale variations are as follows: \(2\cdot\mu\), \(0.5\cdot\mu\), \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=m_{\mathrm{top}}/2\), \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=2\cdot m_{\mathrm{top}}\), \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=4\cdot m_{\mathrm{top}}\) and \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=\infty\) and they are applied standalone or combining a \(\mu\) variation with a \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) variation. Additional samples are produced considering different NLO PDF sets at ME generation. The considered PDF sets are: NNPDF2.3 [8], MSTW2008 [9], HERAPDF1.5 [10] and NNPDF3.0 [11].

* The Powheg+Pythia8, AU2 sample is generated using the same setup as for the Powheg+Pythia6 sample but the PS and the UE are simulated using Pythia8[12] (version 8.183) with AU2 tune [13] and the corresponding CTEQ6L1[7] PDF and the matching is performed using the Main31 user hook [14] of Pythia8.
* The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++, UEEE5 sample is generated with version 2.1.1 of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO event generator [15]. A NLO ME and CT10 PDF are used for the \(t\bar{t}\) hard scattering process. The hard process scale \(\mu\) is set to the MC@NLO generator [16] default value defined by: \[\mu=\sqrt{\frac{p_{\mathrm{T,top}}^{2}+p_{\mathrm{T,top}}^{2}}{2}+m_{\mathrm{ top}}^{2}},\] (2) where \(p_{\mathrm{T,top(\overline{\mathrm{top}})}}\) corresponds to the transverse momentum of the top or anti-top quark. The renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to the value of the scale \(\mu\). The PS, hadronisation and the UE are modelled using the Herwig++ (version 2.7.1) [17] generator. The UEEE5 author Herwig++ tune and the corresponding CTEQ6L1 PDF are used.

Both dileptonic and lepton+jets event samples were produced for comparison with the measured data distributions. All MC generator samples are produced with \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) = 172.5 GeV and within the ATLAS software framework. The hard process scales for Powheg and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO are different due to the technique used to subtract the overlap of the NLO calculation and the PS in each case.

## 3 Data measurements

The published data measurements to which the MC predictions are compared are briefly described below. All the measurements have been performed at the centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. A measurement of \(t\bar{t}\) production with a veto on additional central jet activity has been performed by ATLAS in Ref. [18]. The measurement of jet multiplicity in \(t\bar{t}\) events has been performed in Ref. [19] and also includes measurements of the jet transverse momentum distributions. Finally, the measurement of the differential cross-section as a function of the kinematics of the top quarks has been performed in Ref. [20]. The comparisons all make use of the Rivet analysis system [21].

* \(t\bar{t}\) **production with a veto on additional jet activity** The measurement of the production of \(t\bar{t}\) events with a veto on additional jet activity [18] uses the 'gap fraction' \(f(Q_{0})\) and \(f(Q_{\rm sum})\) variables to quantify additional jet activity. The variables are defined as follows: \[f(Q_{0})=\frac{n(Q_{0})}{N},\] (3) \[f(Q_{\rm sum})=\frac{n(Q_{\rm sum})}{N},\] (4) where \(N\) is the number of selected \(t\bar{t}\) events and \(n(Q_{0})\) is the subset of these events that do not contain an additional jet with transverse momentum, \(p_{\rm T}\), above a threshold, \(Q_{0}\), in a central rapidity interval. \(n(Q_{\rm sum})\) is the number of \(t\bar{t}\) events in which the scalar transverse momentum sum of the additional jets in the rapidity interval is less than \(Q_{\rm sum}\). The gap fraction defined using \(Q_{0}\) is mainly sensitive to the leading-\(p_{\rm T}\) emission accompanying the \(t\bar{t}\) system, whereas the gap fraction defined using \(Q_{\rm sum}\) is sensitive to all hard emissions accompanying the \(t\bar{t}\) system. The \(t\bar{t}\) events are selected in the dilepton channel, requiring exactly two leptons and at least two jets tagged as originating from a \(b\)-quark. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) jet algorithm with a radius parameter \(R=0.4\)[22] and are required to have \(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV and \(|y|<2.4\). Jets originating from \(b\)-quarks are defined as any jet that is within \(\Delta R<0.3\) of a \(B\)-hadron, where the \(B\)-hadrons are required to have \(p_{\rm T}>5\) GeV. All measurements are defined at truth particle level and are corrected for detector effects.
* **Measurement of the \(t\bar{t}\) production cross-section as a function of jet multiplicity and jet transverse momentum** The differential cross-sections are measured as a function of the jet multiplicity for up to eight jets using jet transverse momentum thresholds of 25, 40, 60, and 80 GeV, and as a function of jet transverse momentum up to the fifth leading jet [19]. The events are selected in the lepton+jets channel, requiring exactly one lepton and at least three jets with at least one of the jets tagged as originating from a \(b\)-quark. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) jet algorithm with a radius parameter \(R=0.4\)[22] and are required to have \(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Jets originating from \(b\)-quarks are defined using a \(B\)-hadron matching, requiring at least one \(B\)-hadron to be found within the jet using the ghost association technique [23; 24; 25]. The results are defined at truth particle level and are corrected for all detector effects, within a kinematic range closely matched to the experimental acceptance.
* **Measurements of normalized differential cross-sections for \(t\bar{t}\) production** Differential cross-sections for top quark pair production are measured as a function of the top quark transverse momentum, and of the mass, transverse momentum, and rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) system [20]. Events are selected in the lepton+jets channel, requiring exactly one lepton and at least four jets with at least one of the jets tagged as originating from a \(b\)-quark. Jets are selected as in the previous analysis. The top and anti-top quarks are reconstructed from the reconstructed jets, leptons and missing transverse momentum. The distributions are unfolded to the parton level, corresponding to the point after the top quark has emitted any QCD radiation, but before it decays.

## 4 Powheg+Pythia6

In this section studies using Powheg+Pythia6 samples are performed. Scale parameters as well as the PDF used in the ME calculation are varied and the predictions are compared to unfolded collision data using the Rivet framework. In the dilepton channel the jet gap analysis [18] is used, while in the lepton + jets channel a measurement of the jet multiplicity and transverse momentum spectra is used [19]. Kinematic distributions of the top quark and the \(t\bar{t}\) system are compared on parton level to unfolded data distributions [20]. For more details see Section 3.

### Resummation damping

In this section we study the effect of varying \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) on the top quark and \(t\bar{t}\) system. We compare Powheg+Pythia6 samples with \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=0.5\cdot m_{\mathrm{top}}\), \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), \(2\cdot m_{\mathrm{top}}\), \(4\cdot m_{\mathrm{top}}\) and \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) set to infinity, which is the default setting used by most Run 1 analyses. Since \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) controls the hardness of the hardest emission, which recoils against the \(t\bar{t}\) system, only the transverse momenta are expected to be sensitive to this parameter. Figure 0(a) shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the partonic top quark, where variations of the distribution are visible only for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>200\) GeV, while the discrepancy between the experimental data and the prediction for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>100\) GeV are not resolved by any variation. Figure 0(b) shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system and here a much bigger variation, as expected, is observed. In this observable, smaller values of \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) are preferred. Only values close to the top quark mass are compatible with the unfolded data.

The same variations are also studied using differential distributions of the jet multiplicity as well as the differential distribution of the transverse momentum of the jets.

Figure 1(a) and Figure 1(b) show jet multiplicities for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>80\) GeV, respectively. This measurement is done in the lepton+jets channel which has four jets with high transverse momentum from the top quark decay products in its final state. Therefore the first emission

Figure 1: The Powheg+Pythia6 samples with different \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) variations are compared for the top quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events using unfolded ATLAS data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [20]. The data are represented as closed (black) circles with statistical uncertainties. The yellow band is the total experimental uncertainty on the data (statistical and systematic). The generator predictions are shown as solid coloured lines.

is typically represented by the fifth jet. This can be observed in the jet multiplicity distribution for jets with \(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV. For jets with \(p_{\rm T}>80\) GeV the correlation is not so clear anymore and therefore the \(h_{\rm damp}\) variation is visible in all jet bins. However all variations are within the experimental uncertainty. In the bottom row of Figure 2 the \(p_{\rm T}\) distributions of the first and fifth hardest jet in the event are shown. The hardest jet in the event typically comes from the top quark decay and therefore only mild variations are observed. The first jet has a significant probability of coming from the extra emission only when it has very high \(p_{\rm T}\), leading to the variations seen in the last bin of the distribution. In contrast, the fifth hardest jet typically corresponds to the first emission and therefore significant differences are observed. Note the different ranges of the \(x\)-axes. For this distribution the \(h_{\rm damp}\) =0.5\(\cdot m_{\rm top}\) and \(h_{\rm damp}\) =\(\infty\) samples have deviations that are a bit larger than one standard deviation.

Figure 2: The Powheg+Pythia6 samples with different \(h_{\rm damp}\) variations are compared to jet multiplicities and the transverse momentum of the first and fifth hardest jet in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events using unfolded ATLAS data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [19]. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

In summary, the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system is found to be the observable that is most sensitive to variations of \(h_{\rm damp}\). There one can observe that the smaller the value of \(h_{\rm damp}\) is chosen, the better the prediction fits to the unfolded data. However a value of \(h_{\rm damp}=\)0.5\(\cdot m_{\rm top}\) is outside the uncertainty band of the \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution of the fifth hardest jet as well as for the jet multiplicity distribution for jets with \(p_{\rm T}>80\) GeV.

Taking the available unfolded data into account, the conclusion is that a value of \(h_{\rm damp}\) equal to the top quark mass gives the best data description so far. It must be, however, pointed out that this parameter variation does not improve the description of the top quark momentum.

### Scale variations

In order to access systematic variations connected with the amount of additional radiation and variations of the hard scatter scales two Powheg+Pythia6 samples are compared. The first one uses \(h_{\rm damp}\) =\(m_{\rm top}\), the second \(h_{\rm damp}=2\cdot m_{\rm top}\). For each sample the factorization and renormalization scale are simultaneously (\(\mu=\mu_{f}=\mu_{r}\)) varied by a factor 0.5 or 2, respectively. Independent variations have also been studied, and it was found that the simultaneous variations cover the envelope of all independent variations. The samples are compared with the gap fraction observables [18] in Figure 3, for the jet observables in Figure 4 and with differential distributions of the top parton in Figure 5. The distributions shown in Figure 3 demonstrate nicely that the scale variations and variation of \(h_{\rm damp}\) are correlated, i.e. distributions obtained with \(h_{\rm damp}=2\cdot m_{\rm top}\) are very similar to distributions obtained with \(h_{\rm damp}=\)\(m_{\rm top}\) and \(\mu^{\prime}=0.5\cdot\mu\), where \(\mu\) is the default scale choice detailed in Eq. 1. Additionally the envelope of the variations covers a wider range than the experimental uncertainties. In the case of the jet distributions, the variations are slightly smaller than the experimental uncertainties. As expected the distribution of the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system shows the highest sensitivity to these variations. More sensitivity to scale variations than to changing \(h_{\rm damp}\) can be observed in the \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) distribution, shown in Figure 5b.

In summary, one can see that the variations of \(h_{\rm damp}\) and the factorization and renormalization scale are correlated and that the following two settings cover the envelope of the studied samples: \(h_{\rm damp}\) =\(m_{\rm top}\) together with \(\mu^{\prime}=2\cdot\mu\) and \(h_{\rm damp}=\)\(2\cdot m_{\rm top}\) together with \(\mu^{\prime}=0.5\cdot\mu\). It must, however, be pointed out that none of the variations significantly improves the agreement with data for the top \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) distributions.

This statement does not change if consistent variations of the scale in the PS are also considered. In order to do this we change the tune from the default Perugia 2011c tune to the Perugia 2012 radLo tune [6] for \(\mu^{\prime}=2\cdot\mu\) and the Perugia 2012 radHi tune [6] for \(\mu^{\prime}=0.5\cdot\mu\), respectivly. The result is shown in Figure 6 in the top row. In order to understand if the impact of changing the scale in the parton shower is correlated with the hard scatter scale or anti-correlated, both settings are compared in Figure 6 in the bottom row. The observed differences are very small and we therefore suggest to use the correlated variations as a natural choice for a systematic uncertainty.

Figure 3: The Powheg\(+\)Pythia6 samples with different factorisaton and renormalisation scale variations and different damping values are compared for the jet gap observables [18] in \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton events at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. \(Q_{0}\) is the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold in a central rapidity interval for additional jets and \(Q_{\mathrm{sum}}\) is the scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) sum threshold of the additional jets in a rapidity interval. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

Figure 4: The Powheg+Pythia6 samples with different factorisaton and renormalisation scale variations and different damping values are compared to jet multiplicities and the transverse momentum of the first and fifth hardest jet in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events using unfolded ATLAS data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [19]. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

Figure 5: The Powheg+Pythia6 samples with different factorisaton and renormalisation scale variations are compared to the transverse momentum of the top quark, and the invariant mass and transverse momentum of the \(t\bar{t}\) system in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events using unfolded ATLAS data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [20]. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

Figure 6: The Powheg+Pythia6 samples with different factorisaton and renormalisation scale variations, where the scale is also consistently adjusted in the parton shower (radHi, radLo), are compared for the jet gap observables [18] in \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton events at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. \(Q_{0}\) is the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold in a central rapidity interval for additional jets and \(Q_{\mathrm{sum}}\) is the scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) sum threshold of the additional jets in a rapidity interval. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

### PDF studies

Another free parameter in generating simulated samples for \(t\bar{t}\) production is the choice of PDFs in the generation of the ME. It was shown in Ref. [20] that the choice of the PDF can have quite a significant impact on the kinematics of the \(t\bar{t}\) process. Therefore a variety of NLO PDF sets were studied, including the new NNPDF 3.0 which contains over a thousand new data points, both the recent HERA-II measurements and a wide set of new LHC data as well as improved theory calculations. The result for the kinematic distributions of the partonic top quark is shown in Figure 7. The discrepancy between the prediction and the experimental data for high top quark \(p_{\rm T}\) cannot be solved by any of the used PDF sets. HERAPDF1.5 is closest to the data, but is still outside the uncertainty band. For the \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) distribution, all samples apart from the HERAPDF1.5 are close together. Using the HERAPDF1.5, agreement with the experimental data is achieved in this observable. As expected, the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system shows little sensitivity to the choice of PDF. In contrast to the \(h_{\rm damp}\) and scale variations, the chosen PDF does change the rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) system as shown in Figure 7c. This distribution is described best by the NNPDF sets, while the distribution obtained with the CT10 PDF set is outside the experimental uncertainty. Distributions of the jet multiplicity and the rapidity gap analysis do not show big differences between the different PDF sets and are therefore not shown here.

In conclusion one can see that the PDF mainly changes the invariant mass and rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. In particular the rapidity is quite sensitive to the choice of the PDF set, while this distribution is unchanged by variations of \(h_{\rm damp}\) and the hard scatter scales. The new NNPDF3.0 shows a nice agreement with the unfolded rapidity distribution.

Figure 7: The Powheg+Pythia6 samples with different PDF variations are compared to the transverse momentum of the top quark and \(t\bar{t}\) system in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events using unfolded ATLAS data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [20]. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

## 5 Powheg+Pythia8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++

In the following, the ATLAS baseline \(t\bar{t}\) sample (Powheg+Pythia6 with the damping parameter set to \(m_{\text{top}}\)) is compared with new generator setups, namely Powheg+Pythia8 using the AU2 tune and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ with the UEEE5 tune. In the Powheg+Pythia8 sample, the damping parameter is also set to \(m_{\text{top}}\). The generator predictions are compared to the experimental analyses described in Section 3.

Figure 8 shows the comparison of the three different generator setups with the jet gap fraction observables [18] that are discussed in Section 3. \(f(Q_{0})\) and \(f(Q_{\text{sum}})\) are shown for the rapidity interval \(|y|<0.8\) in Figures 7(a) and 7(b) and for rapidity interval \(|y|<2.1\) in Figures 7(c) and 7(d). The generator predictions for Powheg+Pythia8 agree best with the data, while the largest deviation, of around two times the experimental uncertainty, is observed for the Powheg+Pythia6 sample at low \(f(Q_{\text{sum}})\) values. The distributions for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ give a generally good description of the data, with a small disagreement seen at low \(f(Q_{0})\) values in Figure 7(c).

In Figure 9, the three samples are compared to experimental data for the differential cross-section measured as a function of the number of jets with \(p_{\text{T}}>25\) GeV and as function of the jet transverse momentum of the first and fifth jets. For the Powheg+Pythia8 setup, more jets are predicted than for the other two samples. For more than five jets the predictions of both setups are relying on the PS and so only have approximately leading-logarithm accuracy. Therefore a perfect agreement is not expected. For the leading jet \(p_{\text{T}}\), all generators show good agreement with the data, while for the fifth jet transverse momentum, Powheg+Pythia8 predicts a harder spectrum than observed in the data. Since the fifth jet in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events corresponds to one jet in addition to those from the top quark decay, this distribution is expected to be well predicted by all three setups, which provide an NLO description of \(t\bar{t}\) production. A possible reason for the discrepancy between Powheg+Pythia6 and Powheg+Pythia8 lies in the difference in how Powheg is matched to the different parton showers, e.g. starting scale of the shower. The difference between Powheg+Pythia6 and Powheg+Pythia8 is in general seen to be larger than the scale variations presented in Section 4. The agreement for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ with the data distributions studied here has been found to be better than for Powheg+Pythia8.

Figure 8: The \(t\bar{t}\) baseline sample Powheg+Pythia6 (\(h_{\rm damp}=\)\(m_{\rm top}\)), a Powheg+Pythia8 sample (\(h_{\rm damp}\) =\(m_{\rm top}\)) and a MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ sample are compared to the jet gap fraction observables [18] in \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton channel events at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. \(Q_{0}\) is the \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold in a central rapidity interval for additional jets and \(Q_{\rm sum}\) is the scalar \(p_{\rm T}\) sum threshold of the additional jets in a rapidity interval. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

Figure 9: The \(t\bar{t}\) baseline sample Powheg+Pythia6 (\(h_{\text{damp}}=\)\(m_{\text{top}}\)), a Powheg+Pythia8 sample (\(h_{\text{damp}}\) =\(m_{\text{top}}\)) and a MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ sample are compared to the differential cross-section observables [19] in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets channel events at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

Summary

Various MC generators have been compared to ATLAS measurements of top quark pair production. The impact of variations of the scale and the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter in the Powheg+Pythia6 setup have been investigated and a setting of \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=m_{\mathrm{top}}\) is found to best describe the data, although none of the settings provide a good description of the transverse momentum of the top quarks. The PDF variations show a small impact on the transverse momentum of the top, and a large discrepancy with the data distribution remains. Two new generator setups, Powheg+Pythia8 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ are also compared to the measurements. MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ is found to generally give a better description of the data in the studied distributions, while Powheg+Pythia8 is found to produce too many additional jets and to have a harder transverse momentum spectrum for the fifth jet in lepton+jets events than that observed in the data. Further studies are planned, including comparisons with generators capable of predicting both inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}+1\) jet at NLO accuracy.
