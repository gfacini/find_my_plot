## Chapter 1 Introduction

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is a high energy (14 \(TeV\) center-of-mass) and high luminosity \(proton\)-\(proton\) collider which is being built in the existing LEP tunnel at CERN [1], to be operative in mid 2005. Although LEP has tested the Standard Model with unprecedent precision, there are still open questions about fundamental physics, such as the origin of the electroweak symmetry breaking. The primary purpose of the LHC is to address these questions. The LHC physics agenda includes searches for Higgs and heavy bosons (W',Z'), for super-symmetric (SUSY) particles, for compositeness of fundamental fermions, studies of CP violation in \(B\)-decays, and detailed measurements of \(top\) quark properties.

Most of the physical questions to be answered involve interactions with very low cross section. In this scenario, not only a high energy but also the maximum possible luminosity is required. The \(pp\) bunch crossing rate at the LHC will be 25 \(n\,s\) and the design luminosity is \(10^{34}\;cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). The total inelastic, non-diffractive cross-section at LHC energies will be about 70 \(m\,b\), corresponding to an interaction rate of almost \(10^{9}\;Hz\). High energy and high luminosity open a door to find new physical processes beyond our current understanding.

ATLAS is one of the two general purpose detectors designed to operate at the LHC and to exploit its full discovery potential. ATLAS follows the usual layout of collider detector, with several cylindrically symmetric concentric layers of detection elements. One of those is the hadron calorimeter sub-detector, which is based on a steel-scintillator sampling calorimeter (TileCal). It will measure jet energies and directions as well as missing transverse energy.

The IFAE group is responsible of the construction of one of the two Extended Barrelsof the TileCal hadronic calorimeter. In 1997, a full prototype Extended Barrel module 0 was built in the IFAE assembly hall. Later on, the hall was equipped with all the tools for the assembly of the entire modules and the already-existing submodules assembly line was refurbished. In May 1999 the assembly of the submodules started and the modules instrumentation (equipping the mechanical part with scintillators and fibers) started in October 1999.

The modules are subjected to detailed tests to verify the overall module uniformity and quality. The optical faults must be repaired to assure that the instrumented modules satisfy the physics requirements of ATLAS and be fully operative. The module testing program and its results are the main subject of this work.

It is organized as follows: in Chapter 2 general notions on electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry are given. In Chapter 3 the ATLAS detector is described. The hadronic calorimeter, TileCal, is described on Chapter 4. In Chapter 5 the calibration of the Tile Calorimeter detector is reviewed. In Chapter 6, the assembly procedure of the Extended Barrel modules at IFAE is presented. The optical quality control system used to certify a module is described in Chapter 7. Chapter 8 is devoted to the optical quality control procedure and to a general analysis of the faults found on the first 18 modules produced and their corrections. A related line of work, on the uniformity and light yield of the tiles, and of a module constructed at IFAE and tested at CERN with the \(Cs^{13}\)[7] radioactive source, are described in Chapter 9. Finally, Chapter 10 gives the conclusions of this work and an appendix describes the standard tasks during the optical quality control of a calorimeter module.

## Chapter 2 Calorimetry.

The defining goal of calorimetry is to measure the energy of a high-energy particle by total absorption of its kinetic energy. In this chapter, the basic processes for electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic showers will be described and some basic calorimeter concepts and limitations will be presented [2][3]. Calorimeters play an important role at high-energy machines because, in contrast to other detectors such as magnetic spectrometers, their fractional resolution improves with energy. In particular, at the LHC, calorimeters will be important for the reconstruction of physics channels of prime interest [4].

### 2.1 Basic concepts of calorimetry.

A calorimeter is a block of matter which intercepts a moving particle. Its thickness must be sufficient to cause the particle to interact and deposit essentially all of its energy within the detector volume. At relatively high energy, this process involves the formation of a cascade or "shower" of lower energy particles. Some fraction (often small) of the deposited energy is detected in the form of a signal (i.e. scintillation light, Cherenkov light, or ionization charge), which is proportional to the energy of the incident particle.

Calorimetric particle detectors can be divided in two types: homogeneous calorimeters and sampling calorimeters. In the first, the particles release all their energy in an active medium, which provides the measurable signal. In sampling calorimeters only a fraction of the energy is released in the active medium, which is interleaved between layers of passive absorber medium.

The key parameters that characterize calorimeters are the variation of response showerto shower which determines the energy resolution of a detector, and the average response as a function of energy and type of particle. For electrons and photons only the EM interactions are important, providing the basis for EM calorimeters. However, hadrons mostly shower via hadronic interactions, which involves very different requirements on the instrument. Muons deposit energy predominantly through ionization or excitation (and radiation, pair production at LHC energies), leaving a distinctly different signature. Neutrinos, which interact only weakly, are indirectly detected through the absence of energy deposited in the calorimeter ("missing energy").

Calorimeters offer many attractive capabilities, supplementing or replacing information obtained with magnetic spectrometers:

* They are sensitive to charged and neutral particles, often providing the only practical method for measuring the latter.
* The energy measurement is based on the total absorption of the incident particle through a series of inelastic collisions degrading its energy. The average number \(\overline{N}\) of secondary particles produced at the shower maximum is proportional to the energy of the incident particle \(E\). In principle, the uncertainty in the energy measurement is governed by statistical fluctuations in \(\overline{N}\), and hence the relative energy resolution \(\sigma/E\) improves as \(1/\sqrt{N}\sim E^{-1/2}\).
* The ideal calorimeter should contain the whole shower. Therefore, the depth of a calorimetric detector should match the scale of the longitudinal shower profile, which increases only with the logarithm of incident particle energy (see section 2.2). This can be compared to magnetic spectrometers, where the size of the instrumented magnetic field scales with \(p^{1/2}\), to obtain a given relative momentum resolution \(\Delta p/p\).
* They can be segmented to a very high degree, which allows a precise measurement of the direction of the incoming particles and helps in particle identification.
* Their different response to electrons, muons, and hadrons can be exploited for particle identification.
* The energy information can be available on a relatively fast time scale, depending on the nature of the active medium. This feature is essential for online event selection.

### 2.2 Electromagnetic showers.

The principal mechanisms by which particles that interact only electromagnetically lose their energy in matter include well-understood effects, governed by quantum electrodynamics (QED). There are two EM energy loss mechanisms at high-energy (\(E\geq 100\) MeV) through which the EM cascade grows. Electrons and positrons lose energy by bremsstrahlung radiation (see figure 2.1), whereas photons do so by producing electron-positron pairs (figure 2.2).

Although the rate of these processes depends on energy, at high enough energy one

Figure 2.1: Energy loss mechanisms for electrons and positrons.

Figure 2.2: Photon cross section in lead as a function of the photon energy.

can assume a constant cross section or constant mean free path between energy degrading collisions because the energy dependence is small. This picture allows to construct simplistic but still useful models.

In order to discuss EM calorimetry independently of the material used, it is convenient to introduce two quantities [5]:

* The critical energy, \(E_{c}\), which is defined as the electron energy at which the energy-loss rate for ionization and bremsstrahlung are equal. This can be roughly parameterized as a function of the atomic number of the absorber by \(E_{c}=(610\ MeV)/(Z+1.24)\) for solid and liquids, and \(E_{c}=(710\ MeV)/(Z+0.92)\) for gases.
* The radiation length, \(X_{0}\), which is defined as the distance in the absorber over which the electron energy is reduced by \(\frac{1}{e}\) by bremsstrahlung only. The radiation length can be parameterized within a 5% accuracy as: \[X_{0}\ [g\cdot cm^{-2}]=\frac{71\,6.4\cdot A}{Z(Z+1)\ln(287/\sqrt{Z})}\] (2.1) where \(Z\) is the atomic number and \(A\) the atomic weight. This can be well approximated by \(X_{0}\ [g\cdot cm^{-2}]\approx 1\,80A/Z^{2}\) (to better than 20 % for \(Z>13\)), where \(X_{0}\) is normalized to the density of the material.

As a shower develops, more and more particles are produced by radiation and pair production, but the average energy of these particles decreases. When the average energy of the shower particles reaches \(E_{c}\), the ionization energy loss becomes important and radiation losses become less important. The shower will thus reach a maximum, after which the number of particles decreases gradually. Very roughly, the maximum will occur at \(t_{max}=\ln(E_{0}/E_{c})/\ln(2)\) (as may be derived using a simplified model of the shower).

The longitudinal development of the shower can be described in an almost material independent way in terms of the radiation length \(X_{0}\), for high-energy showers. This scaling in \(X_{0}\) is rather well confirmed by observations (see figure 2.3).

A description of the longitudinal shower profile has been given by Rossi [6] based on the following assumptions:

* the cross section for ionization is energy independent, i.e. \(dE/dx=-E_{c}/X_{0}\);* multiple scattering is neglected and the EM cascade is treated one-dimensionally;
* Compton scattering is neglected.

A convenient analytical description of the profile can be given in the form [5]:

\[\frac{dE}{dt}=E_{0}\,b\frac{(bt)^{a-1}\,e^{-bt}}{\Gamma(a)} \tag{2.2}\]

where \(t=x/X_{0}\), and \(a\) and \(b\) are parameters such that \(t_{max}\) occurs at \((a-1)/b\).

Nowadays, very complete and extensively checked EM shower simulation codes exist. They are used to design calorimeters and simulate in detail their performance.

The transverse shower properties can also be easily understood qualitatively. In the early, most energetic part of the cascade, its lateral spread is characterized mostly by the bremsstrahlung emission and pair production, both of which occur within angles \(\sim m/E\)

Figure 2.3: Longitudinal shower development (left ordinate) of 6 GeV/c electrons in three very different materials, showing the scaling in units of radiation lengths \(X_{0}\). On the right ordinate the shower radius for 90% containment of the shower is given as a function of the shower depth.

to the initial direction. The multiple scattering angle of electrons and positrons in the absorber increasingly influences the lateral spread as the average particle energy decreases; it causes a gradual widening of the shower. In the later development of the cascade, the radial shower dimension scales with the Moliere radius \(\rho_{M}\):

\[\rho_{M}\ [g\cdot cm^{-2}]=X_{0}\frac{E_{s}}{E_{c}} \tag{2.3}\]

where \(E_{s}\approx 21\) MeV. For the purpose of total energy measurements, 99 % of the cascade energy is deposited within a cylinder of radius \(R\)\(\cong\)\(3.5\rho_{M}\).

#### Experimental requirements and limitations of EM calorimeters.

Position and angle measurements are also performed with calorimeters, as well as particle identification.

**- Energy measurement.**

The most important aspects of energy measurement are linearity and resolution. Nonlinear response could be a major concern in experiments where particle energies cover a large range. For instance, in an LHC experiment, one has to measure electrons with a transverse energy from a few GeV (\(H\to ZZ\to 4e\)) up to a few TeV (\(Z^{\prime}\to e^{+}e^{-}\)). For example, operating in a high magnetic field can also be a source of poor linearity at low energy.

The energy resolution gives the uncertainty in a calorimeter measurement and is usually parameterized by the following quadratic sum:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{b}{E}\oplus c \tag{2.4}\]

where \(a\) is the stochastic term (intrinsic resolution), \(b\) is the noise term and \(c\) is the constant term (\(E\) is expressed in GeV). Depending on the energy range involved in an experiment, the optimization of these three parameters can be very different. The best resolution is commonly reached by homogeneous calorimeters, if they are thick enough to absorb \(\gtrsim\) 99 % of the incident energy. There, the intrinsic resolution is given by the statistical fluctuation of the number of detected primary processes. The threshold of detection is usually small enough that the number of processes, which give a useful signal, is large and gives good intrinsic resolution. In general, this fluctuations have to be convoluted with instrumental effects which dominate the resolution: uncertainty in the calibration, stability of the electronics or fluctuations in shower leakages, which contribute to the constant term and the noise term.

In a typical sampling calorimeter, and up to very high energy, the main contribution to the energy resolution is due to sampling fluctuations. The signal is determined by the number of charged tracks crossing the active layers. The total track length (\(T\)) is proportional to the incident particle energy but the number of track segments intercepted in the active layers is \(N\propto f_{samp}\cdot T\). Then the energy resolution is given by the fluctuation in the number of track segments \(N\):

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\propto\frac{1}{\sqrt{f_{samp}E(GeV)}} \tag{2.5}\]

The approximation used is enough to demonstrate the energy dependence of the resolution. As a very large fraction of the energy is deposited by low-energy electrons (MeV) in the high-Z material (absorber), the energy resolution is improved by decreasing the absorber thickness (\(f_{samp}\) will be larger for smaller thickness). This scaling law is valid as long as the absorber thickness is large enough that the crossings between consecutive layers are not correlated.

The \(b\) term of the energy resolution describes the noise and may be dominant at low energy. Besides the electronics noise, a second contribution is important in LHC calorimeters: the pile-up noise. At the LHC design luminosity, about twenty soft collisions will be produced, on average, every bunch crossing, giving rise to so-called pile-up both in space and time. This reflects the high multiplicity of charged and neutral particles with a low average momentum (500 MeV/c) which impact in the calorimeter during each bunch crossing. The fluctuations in the mean value of this pile-up contribute as a noise term to the energy resolution.

The constant term \(c\), dominant at the higher LHC energies, includes many contributions:

* Non-uniformity of the calorimeter from both electronic and mechanical design.

* Signal variation with temperature or pollution of the active medium which may vary across the calorimeter or as a function of time.
* Lateral and longitudinal leakage.
* Degradation of the energy resolution due to the material in front of the calorimeter.

* **Position and angular measurement.**

The segmentation of calorimeters in strips or towers, which are read by different readout elements, has been used to find shower impact positions using center-of-gravity methods. Practical detectors can reach resolutions at the level of a few mm\(/\sqrt{E}\). The energy dependence comes directly from the energy resolution in each of the cells.

The need for an angular measurement provided by the calorimeter has been stressed recently in the context of the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel produced in _pp_ collision at the LHC. The \(\gamma\gamma\) angle enters into the mass resolution, and since at high luminosity the vertex will not be known very precisely, it is necessary to measure this angle with the calorimeter. Such a measurement requires at least two segments in depth and a sufficiently long level arm.

* **Particle identification.**

Rough particle identification is performed using as a basis the lateral and longitudinal shower profiles and comparing them to those expected from EM versus hadronic showers. The typical pattern of energy deposition of muons also allows to identify them in most cases. The demands are quite different depending on the physics process to be studied.

### 2.3 Hadronic showers.

When a hadron passes through matter, it interacts with the nuclei of the medium through strong interaction processes. This opens up a large variety of reaction channels for hadronic showers to develop, making them more difficult to describe and predict than EM showers. Basically, when a hadron enters the absorber, it interacts with a nucleus and produces many secondary particles. These particles then lose their energy either by starting further reactions and creating more particles or by ionizing the surrounding media, propagating in a shower (figure 2.4) until all the incident energy is spent.

Two main parts of a hadronic shower can be distinguished:

* A considerable part of the secondary particles are \(\pi^{0}\)'s, which will shower electromagnetically after the \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay without any further nuclear interactions (EM component). The size of the \(\pi^{0}\) component is largely determined by the production of \(\pi^{0}\) in the early stages of the shower development, and event by event fluctuations about the mean are therefore important.
* The rest of the hadron secondary particles lose some energy by \(dE/dx\) in the material, but a sizeable amount of the available energy is converted into excitations or break-up of the nuclei. Therefore only a fraction of the energy losses will result in detectable ('visible') energy.

The distribution of the deposited hadron energy is similar to that of an EM shower in shape, but its dimensions scale roughly with the nuclear interaction length \(\lambda\). The nuclear interaction length governs both the lateral and longitudinal dimensions of the hadronic shower. A rough estimate can be made using:

\[\lambda\;[g/cm^{2}]\simeq\;35A^{1/3} \tag{2.6}\]

The longitudinal shower maximum occurs at a distance from the front of the detector, \(t_{max}\) which may be parametrized by:

\[t_{max}[\lambda]\simeq 0.2\ln(E)+0.7 \tag{2.7}\]

Figure 2.4: Hadronic shower development.

where \(E\) is the energy of the incoming hadron in GeV. The depth required to contain on average \(\,95\%\) of the energy is [2]:

\[t_{95\%}[\lambda]\simeq t_{max}+2.5E^{0.13} \tag{2.8}\]

with \(t_{max}\) in units of \(\lambda\) and \(E\) in GeV. An experimental measurement of the longitudinal profile in a calorimeter is shown in figure 2.5.

The lateral energy deposit profile shows a highly energetic, relatively collimated, core due to \(\pi^{0}\) production in the shower with a halo produced by shower particles of lower energy which move further away from the shower axis. The lateral dimensions scale with \(\lambda\), but also depend on the energy of the incident particle.

The shower dimensions can be used to distinguish between hadronic and EM showers most easily in materials with large Z. In this case, the ratio \(\lambda/X_{0}\) is high and the hadronic showers are much longer and wider than the EM showers.

#### Energy resolution and limitations of hadronic calorimeters.

As for EM calorimeters, one can parameterize the resolution by the relation 2.4. The first term, \(a\), is the quadratic sum of sampling fluctuations and intrinsic resolution. The sampling fluctuations are roughly twice as large for hadronic showers than for EM showers

Figure 2.5: Longitudinal (\(300\,\) GeV) and lateral hadronic shower profiles.

in the same calorimeter. The fluctuations in hadronic shower development are greater than those for an EM shower. This is not only because the shower is produced by relatively few interactions, but also because processes develop very differently. There are large, non-Gaussian fluctuations in the EM fraction of hadron shower, largely dependent on the nuclear interactions early in the shower. The fraction of energy that does not produce a signal varies from event to event with an average of \(\sim\)40%. These fluctuations contribute to the resolution in a statistical way, proportional to \(E^{-1/2}\).

One of the most important parameters for energy resolution in a hadronic calorimeter is the ratio of observed signal for the EM and non EM components of a hadronic shower, the so-called \(e/h\) ratio. The consequences of \(e/h\neq 1\) include:

* A contribution to the energy resolution due to fluctuations in the fraction of the EM component;
* A non-linear response with energy;
* A non-Gaussian signal distribution;
* Deviations from scaling with \(E^{-1/2}\), which dominate the energy resolution at high energies;
* Energy dependence of the measured \(e/\pi\) signal ratio.

Therefore, a compensating calorimeter is desirable for high-precision hadron detection. Various possibilities to achieve \(e/h\sim 1\) have been investigated:

* The non-EM response can be increased by using a fissionable material as an absorber, such as depleted uranium [7]. The extra energy created in the nuclear fission reaction can be detected in the readout material.
* The EM response can be decreased by combining a low-Z active material with a high Z-absorber in order to suppress the response from the photoelectric effect in the active material.
* The non-EM response can be increased by using a hydrogenous material as the active component. In such a material, due to elastic \(n-p\) scattering, protons will take up an appreciable fraction of the energy of the neutron, and will produce a visible ionization signal.

The second term in the energy resolution parameterization, \(b\), as well as the constant term, \(c\), has the same contributions than the ones for the EM calorimeter, i.e. electronic noise and pile-up for the second term; and energy miscalibration, non-uniformities, leakage, etc. for the constant term. However, there is an additional contribution from \(e/h\neq 1\) that is typically the main irreducible contribution to the constant term.

The two general purpose LHC experiments have chosen hadronic calorimeters without compensation. The ATLAS central hadronic calorimeter [8] is made of large scintillating tiles based on a sampling structure with interleaved steel absorber and scintillating plates read out by wavelength shifting fibers. The \(e/\pi\) ratio for such a calorimeter is around 1.1-1.2, the introduction of depth segmentation permits the application of software corrections that restore linearity, thereby fulfilling the requirements without the constraints imposed by the design of a compensating calorimeter.

## Chapter 3 The ATLAS detector for the LHC.

Different design philosophies, optimizing the physics goals and trying to reduce the costs, have been followed for the experiments being constructed to exploit the LHC physics potential. ATLAS [9][10] is one of them: a general-purpose detector which uses a large air-core toroid system as a muon spectrometer, the liquid-argon technique for the electromagnetic and end-cap hadronic calorimeters, iron-scintillator hadronic calorimetry in the barrel, a superconducting solenoid as the tracker magnet, semiconductor detectors in the inner-tracking system and straw-tubes in the outer tracker part.

The design of ATLAS and the other LHC detectors is driven by the need to select the "interesting" events from the \(\sim 10^{9}\) interactions/second that will take place at design luminosity. Besides being able to trigger on such events, the detector must measure the relevant kinematic quantities with sufficient precision to achieve the required rejection power against the expected backgrounds. A special case is "pile-up": in each bunch crossing, 23 interactions will take place which imposes strong requirements to the design and performance of the LHC detectors. They must be rather fast (response \(<\) 50 _ns_) and highly granular to minimize the contribution of pile-up in a given detector cell. Also, the detectors have to be resistant enough to work in a high-radiation environment, due to high fluxes of particles resulting from the \(pp\) interactions.

### 3.1 ATLAS: The overall detector concept.

The detector has been designed to have very good electromagnetic calorimetry for \(e\),\(\gamma\) identification and measurement, hermetic jet and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) calorimetry, efficient tracking athigh luminosity for lepton measurements, \(b\) quark tagging and enhanced \(e\),\(\gamma\) identification, \(\tau\) and heavy flavor vertexing and reconstruction capability of some \(B\) decays and low _p_\({}_{T}\) thresholds for the trigger. A few aspects of the sub-detector systems are listed below.

The magnet configuration, with the inner superconducting solenoid, and large superconducting air-core toroids consisting of independent coils arranged with an eight-fold symmetry outside the calorimetry, offers a high-resolution, large-acceptance and robust stand-alone muon spectrometer.

The inner detector is contained within a cylinder of 7.0 \(m\) length and 1.15 \(m\) radius (acceptance in the range \(|\eta|<2.5\)), in a magnetic field of 2 \(T\). Pattern recognition, momentum and vertex measurements with high efficiency, and electron identification are achieved with a combination of discrete high resolution pixel and strip detectors in the inner part and continuous straw-tube tracking detectors with Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) capability in the outer part of the detector volume.

The electromagnetic calorimeter is a highly granular lead liquid-Argon (LAr) detector with accordion geometry. The electromagnetic sampling calorimetry has a good performance in terms of energy and position resolutions, covering the pseudo-rapidity range

Figure 3.1: General view of the ATLAS detector.

\(|\eta|<3.2\). In the end-caps, the LAr technology is also used for the hadronic calorimeter, sharing the cryostats with the electromagnetic end-caps. The same cryostats also house the LAr forward calorimeters which extend the coverage to \(3.2<|\eta|<4.9\). The bulk of the hadronic calorimetry is provided by a scintillator Tile Calorimeter, TileCal, which is separated into one large barrel and two extended barrel cylinders on each side. The whole calorimeter system contributes to the very good jet and \(E_{T}^{m\,s\,s}\) performance of the detector.

The calorimetry system is surrounded by the muon spectrometer. Three stations of high precision tracking chambers with \(\sim 60\)\(\mu\)_m_ intrinsic resolution measure the coordinates of muons bending in the field. The muon instrumentation is complemented with fast trigger chambers.

The combination of all these sub-detectors defines the overall dimensions of the ATLAS detector. The outer chambers of the barrel are at a radius of about 11 \(m\). The length of the barrel toroid coils is \(\pm 13\)_m_, and the third layer of the forward muon chambers are mounted on separate "wheels" located at \(\pm 21\)_m_ from the interaction point. The overall weight of the ATLAS detector is of about 7000 tons.

### 3.2 ATLAS calorimetry: description and requirements.

The tasks of the calorimeters at hadron colliders consist of an accurate measurement of the energy and detection of electrons and photons, the measurement of the energy and direction of jets (and of the missing transverse momentum of the event) and particle identification (for instance separation of electrons and photons from hadrons and jets, and of \(\tau\) hadronic decays from jets, and event selection at the trigger level).

The ATLAS calorimeter has been designed to meet the diverse demands of the LHC physics program while operating in its very high luminosity environment. Figure 3.2 shows the calorimeter layout. A barrel cryostat around the inner detector cavity contains the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter and the solenoidal coil, which supplies a uniform magnetic field to the inner tracking volume. This coil is placed in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. Two end-cap cryostats enclose the electromagnetic and hadronic end-cap calorimeters and the integrated forward calorimeter. The barrel and the extended barrel hadronic calorimeters together form a structure that also acts as the main solenoid flux return, and consist of scintillating tiles and iron absorber plates.

#### The Electromagnetic Calorimeter.

Many important physics processes at the LHC, such as the decay of Higgs bosons into photons or electrons, or the detection of new gauge bosons (Z' or W') decaying to electrons, place stringent requirements on the electromagnetic calorimetry in terms of acceptance, dynamic range, particle identification, energy resolution, and direction measurements.

The electromagnetic calorimeter [11] (figure 3.3) must be able to identify and accurately reconstruct electrons and photons over a wide energy range. The calorimeter uses lead absorbers in a liquid Argon ionization calorimeter and is divided into a barrel part (\(|\eta|<1.475\)) and two end caps (\(1.375<|\eta|<3.2\)), both implemented in an "accordion" geometry. The longitudinal and transverse segmentation of the electromagnetic calorimeter allows to reconstruct the shower shape and will be an essential tool in rejecting jet backgrounds. The segmentation of the electromagnetic calorimeter has been chosen to be \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.025\times 0.025\) over most of the rapidity coverage. The first sampling has a much finer segmentation and therefore plays the role of a pre-shower device. The

* **Energy linearity:** from the study of quark compositeness, the jet energy scale has to be linear within 2% up to a transverse energy of 4 TeV.

#### 3.2.2.1 The Tile Calorimeter.

TileCal [8] is the hadronic calorimeter of the ATLAS detector, which covers the range \(|\eta|<\) 1.7. Its detection principle is based on the sampling technique using iron as absorber material and scintillating plates (tiles) read out by wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers. The tiles are placed in planes perpendicular to the beam axis and staggered in depth, simplifying the mechanical construction and the fiber routing, while providing a uniform sampling fraction. The TileCal calorimeter is divided into a barrel and two extended barrel cylinders.

From the test beam runs with the electromagnetic and hadronic prototype modules, the pion resolution obtained was:

\[\frac{\Delta\,E}{E}=\frac{(38\,3\pm 4.6)\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus(1.62\pm 0.29)\% \oplus\,\frac{(3.06\pm 0.18\,)\%}{E}\]

well within the ATLAS specifications for the \(\eta\) region covered by TileCal.

#### 3.2.2.2 The LAr Hadronic Calorimeter system

In the range \(1.5<|\eta|<4.9\) the Liquid Argon Hadronic Calorimeter [11] gradually takes over from TileCal: the end-cap hadronic calorimeter extends to \(|\eta|=3.2\) while the range \(3.1<|\eta|<4.9\) is covered by the high-density forward calorimeter. Both the hadronic end-cap and the forward calorimeters are integrated in the same cryostat housing also the electromagnetic end-caps.

Each hadronic end-cap calorimeter consist of two independent wheels of equal diameter. The first wheel is built out of 25 _mm_ copper plates, while the second one uses 50 _mm_ plates; in both wheels the gap between consecutive copper plates is 8.5 _mm_, and is equipped with 3 electrodes that split it in 4 drift spaces of \(\sim\) 1.8 _mm_ each. The wheels are divided in two longitudinal read-out segments. The read-out cells are fully pointing in \(\phi\) but only "pseudo-pointing" in \(\eta\). The thickness of the active part of the end-cap calorimeter is \(\sim\) 12 \(\lambda_{abs}\).

Figure 3.4: TileCal extended barrel module 0 constructed at IFAE in 1997.

Figure 3.5: Prototype module of the Forward Calorimeter.

In ATLAS the Forward Calorimeter [11] is integrated in the end-cap cryostat, with the front face at about 5 \(m\) from the interaction point. The forward calorimeter is a particularly challenging detector due to the high level of radiation which has to be exposed. However, it benefits from continuity of coverage, reducing to the minimum the effects of the crack in the transition region around \(\eta=3.1\), with advantages for the efficiency of forward jet tagging and the reduction of the tails in the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution. The forward calorimeter has to accommodate at least 9 \(\lambda_{abs}\) of active detector in a rather short longitudinal space. Thus it is a high density detector, consisting of three longitudinal sections, the first one made of copper, and the other two of tungsten. Each of them consists of a metal matrix with regularly spaced longitudinal channels filled with rods. The sensitive medium is Liquid Argon that fills the gap between the rod and matrix. The gaps are 250 microns wide in the first section and 375 (500) microns in the second (last) one. In the forward calorimeter the electronic noise in a jet cone of \(\Delta R=0.5\) is \(\sim 1\) GeV \(E_{T}\) at \(\eta=3.2\) and drops quickly to 0.1 GeV in \(E_{T}\) at \(\eta=4.6\). The expected jet resolution in the full rapidity range combining the information from the various calorimeters is shown in figure 3.6 and is adequate for the measurements to be performed.

Figure 3.6: The expected jet resolution in ATLAS for the full rapidity range.

## Chapter 4 The ATLAS Tile Calorimeter.

In this chapter, the essential design features of the ATLAS hadronic calorimeter at small-to-mid \(\eta\) are summarized: the geometry, the optics and the electronics. It was designed to meet the requirements of the ATLAS detector, exposed in the previous chapter.

### 4.1 The geometry of the Tile Calorimeter.

The Tile Calorimeter consists of a cylindrical structure with inner and outer radius of 2280 and 4230 _mm_ respectively. It is subdivided into a barrel part which is 5640 _mm_ in length along the beam axis and two extended barrels which are 2910 _mm_ long. Between the barrel and the extended barrels there is a gap of about 600 _mm_, which is needed for the Inner Detector and the LAr cabling, electronics and services. The loss of hermeticity implied by this gap is corrected by using an Intermediate Tile Calorimeter (ITC), with the same structure as the rest of the calorimeter, but with special geometry. The barrel covers the region \(|\eta|<1.0\), and the extended barrels cover the region \(0.8<|\eta|<1.7\).

The basic geometrical element of the calorimeter, called a period, consists of two master trapezoid plates 5 _mm_ thick, and one set of spacer trapezoids plates 4 _mm_ in thickness. The spacer plates are placed between the master plates; each master/spacer set defines a half period. The relative position of the spacers in the two half periods is staggered in the radial direction to leave empty pockets where the 3 _mm_ thick scintillator tiles are placed.

Each detector cylinder is built of 64 independent modules along the azimuthal direction. The highly periodic structure of the system (along \(z\)) allows the construction ofthese azimuthal wedges by assembling smaller sub-modules together. Since the mechanical assembly is completely independent from the optical instrumentation, the assembly becomes simple and cost effective.

The thickness of the calorimeter (\(\sim 8\lambda\)) is chosen such that the hadronic showers are well contained and that there is enough material to reduce the particle flux reaching the muon system. In addition, the ability to identify muons will help to recover the momentum resolution for low energy muons, where energy losses in the calorimeter must be accounted for accurately.

### 4.2 The optics of the Tile Calorimeter.

Eleven sets of tiles of radial sizes from 97 \(mm\) to 1 87 \(mm\), pointing radially to the beam line, are used as the active material of the detector. A pair of wavelength shifting (WLS) fibers collects light from the tiles at both of the \(\phi\) edges of the tiles. Readout cells are defined by grouping together a set of fibers onto a PMT, obtaining three-dimensional segmentation. The segmentation formed by the module geometry and scintillator cell structures is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)=\(0.1\times 0.1\). In the last radial layer, where the broad tails of hadronic showers will be measured, the segmentation is \(0.2\times 0.1\).

Ionizing particles crossing the tiles induce the production of light in the base material

Figure 4.1: The principle to the Tile Calorimeter design.

of the tiles, with wavelengths in the UV range, which subsequently is converted to visible light by scintillator dyes. This scintillation light propagates through the tile to its edges, where it is absorbed by the WLS fibers and shifted to a longer wavelength (chosen to match the sensitive region of the PMT photocathode). A light mixer is placed between the fibers and the photocathode to optimize detection uniformity.

The driving philosophy behind the optics design is to achieve and maintain a uniform, minimum light yield that achieves the required resolution. The necessary photostatistics corresponds to a photoelectron yield of 0.5 photoelectrons per minimum ionizing particle (_mip_) per tile at normal incidence. However, including a safety factor the aimed-for yield is 1 photoelectron. The photoelectron yield is a complex factor depending not only on the light output of the tiles, but also on the light collection efficiency, the PMT choice and the fiber choice.

Non-uniformity throughout the detector should also be kept small so as not to impact the constant term of the resolution. The baseline goal is an _rms_ non-uniformity within a cell up to 10%. The radial fluctuations inside a cell due to the fact that two tiles can be read by the same fiber are typically 5% to 10% and cannot be improved without substantially increasing the number of fibers.

Furthermore, the detector is expected to operate a minimum of 10 _years_. Typical aging rates for a scintillator-WLS system is 1-3% loss of light per year. To provide a safety margin for aging and other effects a requirement of a minimum light yield \(<1.2\;phe/mip/tile\) at production was set.

#### The scintillators.

The scintillating tiles are the active medium of the TileCal calorimeter. Light yield, uniformity of response within a tile and tile-to-tile uniformity are key performance issues.

TileCal contains 11 different sizes of trapezoidal shaped tiles, ranging from 220 to 360 _mm_ in the azimuthal direction and from 97 to 187 _mm_ in radial width. The tile thickness is 3 _mm_. Each tile has two holes, 9 _mm_ in diameter, through the surface for the passage of the calibration source tubes, and mechanical fasteners.

Commercially available optically transparent granulated polystyrene is used as the scintillation matrix base. The polystyrene is dried and then mixed with finely dispersed wavelength shifting dyes. The wavelength shifting process consists of a sequence of light absorptions and emissions in the chosen dye system. The chosen dopants are parameter-phenyl (PTP) -1.5%- and POPOP -0.04%-. In a binary scintillator such as used in Tile-Cal, the initial radiation at the wavelengths 240-300 _nm_ induced by the ionizing particles is transmitted through the polystyrene lattice until it is absorbed by a primary PTP molecule. PTP emits light in the range 320-400 _nm_, which is absorbed by POPOP and converted to a longer blue wavelength (around 420 _nm_ and higher).

The uniformity of the light output of a tile depends on the local light yield uniformity and on the tile transparency. Fluctuations in tile properties depend on both the raw material properties and the stability of the molding machine operation. Internal stresses, flow lines and other plastic deformations in the tiles may affect their optical quality.

Before the scintillating tiles are inserted into TileCal, they are wrapped with a covering material. The wrapper protects the optically reflective surface of the tile from contact with other materials. It also provides protection from mechanical damage and enhances the light yield by redirecting some of the light which is not captured by internal reflections back into the tile. To achieve a non-uniformity across the tiles below 5%, a non-reflective mask is printed on the wrapper. \(Tyvek^{TM}\), a material made of high density polyethylene fibers, has been chosen because of its high reflectance and mechanical toughness. The gain in light output is between 5% and 10%, compared to ordinary paper wrapping, and about 20% compared with unwrapped tiles.

#### The WLS fibers.

Each fiber collects scintillation light from of one to three tiles and transmits it to a PMT in the girder. The fluor in the fiber absorbs the blue light from the scintillator and re-emits it at a longer wavelength. The light subsequently propagates along the fiber, of 1 _mm_ diameter, by total internal reflection. Light collection is required to be efficient, fast, with low attenuation along the fiber and the fibers must be radiation hard, up to a total dose of 400 _Gy_. Natural aging over ten years should be negligible.

Four fibers for the barrels and three for the extended barrels are required to read out one side of each half-period. In the barrel the fiber length ranges from between 85 _cm_ and 210 _cm_, depending on which cell is to be read and the location of the half-period. In the extended barrel the fiber length ranges from 90 _cm_ to 230 _cm_. Extruded profiles, each of which carries three (or four) WLS fibers, are used to keep the fibers in contact with scintillator edges (see figure 4.2).

The WLS fibers have been selected to have the following requirements:

* The absorption spectrum of the fiber matches the emission spectrum of the scintillator and the emission spectrum of the fiber matches the quantum efficiency of the PMT.
* The fibers have high light yield and attenuation length.
* The fibers are flexible enough, suffering minimum damage by stress due to curved paths.
* The direct fiber response (Cherenkov and scintillation light) to ionizing particles is small in order to avoid large signals from particles passing between modules.

#### Fiber routing.

The Tile Cal module cells are pseudo-projective in \(\eta\). The cell geometry for half of a barrel module is shown in figure 4.3 and for a full extended barrel in figure 4.4.

One of the most important parameters for the cell response is the "light budget", which is defined as the product of the tile response and the fiber response. The cells within TileCal group several tile sizes and several fiber lengths, in general leading to

Figure 4.2: Profiles driving the WLS fibers to contact the tiles.

## Chapter 4 The ATLAS Tile Calorimeter

Figure 4.4: Cell geometry of a extended barrel module.

Figure 4.3: Cell geometry of half of a barrel module.

non-uniformities of light output within a cell and amongst cells themselves. It is the purpose of the fiber routing design to minimize these non-uniformities. The conditions to be satisfied by the fiber routing design are:

* Minimized non-uniformity within cells.
* Maximal light output in order to keep a high photostatistics level.
* Minimal fiber length for optimum light output, to minimize the volume of the fiber in the girder region and also to minimize the cost.
* Small non-uniformity amongst cells to allow PMTs to have similar gains.
* Small number of different fiber lengths for efficient fiber insertion into profiles.

The fibers reach the PMTs in a bundle, i.e., all the fibers reading one side of a cell are routed in a group. These bundles are glued into containers (called "aspirin tubes"), that have been previously introduced in the bundle rings in the drawer. Later they are cut with a precision of better than 0.1 _mm_, such that the air gap between the end of the bundle and the PMT is \(\sim 1\)_mm_; at the same time, they are polished to a flatness of few \(\mu\)_mm_. Each of the bundles arriving to a PMT is made up of different sub-bundles grouping a smaller number of fibers. The main difference between the different bundles is the way the sub-bundles are routed to their appropriate PMT.

### 4.3 The electronics of the Tile Calorimeter.

Front-end and digitizing electronics reside in a cavity inside the girder, on a system of removable drawers also containing the PMTs. A variety of control and calibration signals are generated within the drawers. They also contain electronics to process the signals coming from the fast pulse shapers and the integrator used for calibration. Phototube HVs are locally regulated and derived from a voltage source common to the drawer. Digitizers and digital pipelines are also local, and the digital information is transferred to the Readout Drivers (RODs) in the counting room via cables or optical fibers.

The only electronics outside the drawers is located in the electronics room, and consist of the HV source power supply, the Level-1 trigger (LVL1), the Tile Calorimeter Readout Drivers, and the control electronics for the three calibration systems. The general scheme of the calorimeter readout is given in figure 4.5.

The calorimeter must be able to measure energy depositions up to 2 TeV in a single cell. This determines, at the high end, the dynamic range of the electronics. At the low end, it should be able to measure the signal from muons, which deposit 0.5 GeV in the thinnest cell. The resolution of the readout system must be small compared to the intrinsic energy resolution of the calorimeter.

#### PMT Blocks.

The PMT block contains a light mixer, a phototube, a divider, and a so-called 3-in-1 base (see figure 4.6). The PMT block is contained within a cylindrical shell which acts as magnetic shielding and reads out one fiber bundle of TileCal.

* **The PMTs.**

Figure 4.5: General scheme of the Tile Calorimeter readout.

The main requirements of the PMTs are a nominal gain of \(10^{5}\) with a high voltage of less than 1 \(kV\); a quantum efficiency of more than 18% at 480 \(\it{nm}\); a dark current at nominal gain smaller than 1 \(\it{nA}\); and a maximum non-linearity of 2% for pulses of 15 \(\it{ns}\) and 50 \(\it{mA}\) currents.

To allow individual adjustment of the PMT gains while keeping a reasonable cost for power supplies, the high-voltage power is organized into two stages. First, a general HV power supply provides a single voltage to each drawer. Then, within the drawers, controllers using optocouplers distribute individual voltages to the PMTs. The external HV power supplies provide 10 \(\it{mA}\) at 1 \(kV\) to each drawer. The individual HVs are stabilized to better than 0.1%.

- Light mixers.Most PMTs exhibit large variations in response over their photocathode surfaces, but the photoelectrons generated by light coming from the various fibers inside a given bundle must be independent of the fiber location at the photocathode. The role of the light mixer is to spread the light coming from the fibers so that there is no correlation between the position of a fiber and the area of the photocathode which receives its light.

The light mixers must have the following characteristics: uniform light output at a

Figure 4.6: PMT block scheme.

level of at least 90%; high light acceptance; light attenuation of a few percent; short length to provide space for the 3-in-1 base and to provide an air gap of less than 1 _mm_ between the PMT block and the fiber bundle; and no Cherenkov light from incoming particles.

A square light guide with a length of 1.9 times its side and with a face that is fully contained by the photocathode exhibits the required performance. This corresponds to a length of 35 _mm_ and a face of \(18\times 18\)\(mm^{2}\) for the chosen PMTs. The maximum variations in uniformity using the light mixer are about 10%.

From the optical point of view, air gaps introduce a sizeable loss of light. However, this loss is stable and independent of the size of the gap, as long as it is within a range of \(\sim\)1 mm. This distance is enough to allow mechanical movement of the drawers.

- 3-in-1 boards.

The 3-in-1 boards in the PMT block form the front-end of the electronics readout chain. They provide 3 basic functions: pulse shaping, charge injection calibration, and slow integration of the PMT signals for monitoring and calibration. They are located inside the steel shield of the PMT. This location of the front-end electronics provides an operating environment shielded from electrical noise and magnetic fields. The ambient radiation levels are low and the thermal stability inside the steel girder is excellent.

#### Fast pulse electronics.

The fast readout electronics must process signals from 10.110 PMTs every 25 _ns._ These signals have a dynamic range of 16 bits and a precision of 12 bits. A design based on using a linear dual-gain pulse shaper and two commercial 12-bit ADC chips per channel (the bi-gain design) has been chosen. For TileCal, with its relatively modest number of channels and low channel density, digital pipeline storage has been developed instead of analogue pipeline storage.

Signals corresponding to the energy in the 2000 calorimeter trigger towers must be formed and sent to the LVL1 trigger electronics on every beam crossing. During the 2.5\(\mu\)_s_ latency of the LVL1 trigger, the individual calorimeter signals are stored in the pipeline. Following the latency period, data from events accepted by the LVL1 trigger are passed to RODs for further processing. Signals from beam crossings failing the LVL1 trigger are discarded.

## Chapter 5 Calibration of the Tile Calorimeter.

The role of the Tile Calorimeter is to measure particle and jet energies and angles, over the interval \(|\eta|<1.7\). The overall energy calibration factor, i.e., the conversion factor that relates the energy released in the calorimeter to the digitized signal produced at the end of the readout chain, is then needed. In such a large experiment, which will last several years, calibration constants for each readout channel could change during its lifetime. For these reasons besides measuring these calibration factors for each readout channel, and minimizing channel-to-channel variations, it is also necessary to monitor these set of calibration factors over the lifetime of the detector.

It is aimed to achieve a 2% constant term in the energy resolution of a system with 10.000 channels. This requires the calibration of each cell to be carefully established and monitored with time. A combined calibration approach involving test-beams, radioactive sources, pulsed laser, and electronic charge injection is planned. Together, these tools monitor the scintillators, fibers, PMTs and readout chain, will identify the source of any variation and will ensure cell-to-cell uniformity.

### 5.1 The overall calibration factor.

The overall calibration of the hadronic calorimeter is not straightforward. The difficulty comes from the transfer of the single-pion response to the jet response, and from the different types of jets (gluon, light-quark, b-quark), which will probably require separatecalibration given their different particle multiplicities, lepton content, etc.

A few approaches have been studied and simulated in considerable detail:

1. \(Tau\) lepton decays are a potential source of isolated hadrons, whose momentum vector \(\vec{p}\) can be accurately measured using the tracking detectors. Since their energy \(E\) will be measured in the calorimeter, the relation \(E/p\approx 1\) can be used to adjust the absolute energy scale for pions. Also for the hadronic calorimeters, the \(E/p\) measurement with single pions is potentially a useful tool for cell intercalibration.
2. Information from \(\gamma+jet\) and \(Z^{0}+jet\) events can be used to transfer the energy scale from the electromagnetic calorimeter and inner detector to the hadronic calorimeters through \(p_{T}\)-balance. In these samples, selection of events where the jet is a \(b\)-quark would provide the \(b\)-jet scale as well. One of the limitations due to systematic effects is that the \(\gamma+jet\) sample contains a significant amount of background (especially for low \(p_{T}\)). Also both contain a mixture of quark and gluon jets; therefore an accurate calibration will require the disentangling of systematic differences between the quark and gluon jet energy scales, which are expected to be different since gluon fragmentation is broader (with higher particle multiplicities) than the light quark fragmentation. Also, the jet veto together with the effect of final state radiation may produce some bias in the \(p_{T}\) balance.
3. The use of \(W\to jet\)-\(jet\) decays, given the precise knowledge of the \(W\) mass, is most probably the best calibration method to be applied in \(top\)-mass measurements, and more generally for dijet and multi-jet mass spectroscopy. At a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)\(cm^{-2}s^{-1}\), hundreds of thousands of \(W\) bosons from top quark decays will be reconstructed each year. This sample will provide a great opportunity to calibrate the absolute jet energy scale of the ATLAS calorimeters, but the overlap of the two jets for energetic \(W\)s will need thorough studies to choose the best algorithm and control systematic effects. However, given the large number of events in these "control samples" at the LHC, the ultimate precision on the energy scale will most likely be dominated by systematic effects, related more to the knowledge of the physics (background, presence of additional jets in the event, underlying event) than to the comprehension of detector effects. Thanks to the availability of high statistics data samples a detailed study of the detector effects will be possible, and will give the possibility of correcting them to a certain extent.

### 5.2 Intercalibration and monitoring.

Under this heading the procedures to equalize and then monitor the responses of the calorimeter cells will be described. The signal path can be separated in three stages (figure 5.1). In the first one, the particle energy deposited into scintillators is transformed into a light pulse. Second, the light pulse is converted into a charge at the PMT anode which depends on gain and quantum efficiency of the PMT. Finally the electrical signal, contained in the charge coming from the PMT anode, is shaped and digitized.

The response of each stage could change in time. Light yield may change due to aging processes of the scintillators and fibers, or to radiation damage (other possible changes of the light yield, such as deterioration of optical contact, may be more abrupt). The photo-multiplier response may change due to gain drifts (typically occurring over hours to days), deterioration of gain or quantum efficiency (much slower except for excessive signal loads), etc. It is also necessary to monitor the behavior of each electronic read-out channel. This will allow a prompt diagnostic of read-out faults and also tests with realistic patterns of energy deposition over the full calorimeter (and incidentally, to test for any cross-talk effects).

The intercalibration and monitoring strategy for the TileCal is based on several tools:

* Movable radioactive sources which excite light in all scintillators in very close analogy to particles produced in LHC interactions.
* A laser which produces, for each PMT, a light pulse which closely mimics scintillator pulses.

Figure 5.1: Conceptual diagram of signal path for the Tile Calorimeter and calibration entry points.

* A charge injection system (CIS), which generates a charge signal like the one that would come from the PMT on each read-out channel.
* During data taking at the LHC, continuous monitoring of the signal produced in the calorimeter by minimum bias (MB or "pile-up") interactions.

Monitoring the calorimeter response with a precision of about 1 % is useful for early detection of any degradation phenomena. Requirements on the intercalibration of the readout cells must be set in terms of the overall resolution of the calorimeter, and they turn out to be much less stringent than 1%.

#### The laser system.

The main purpose of the laser system is to monitor the response of the PMTs on any desired time scale. It is planned to obtain the PMT gain to a relative precision of 0.5% by measuring the laser light intensity pulse by pulse. This system will also be useful to check the performance of fast pulse electronics.

The laser system is based on a computer-controlled frequency-doubled \(YLF\)1 solid-state laser in which the light pulses are externally triggered and intensity-modulated. The laser pulses closely mimic the scintillating light pulses produced by particles in the calorimeter, having a wavelength of 480 _nm_ and a pulse width of about 15 _ns_.

Footnote 1: The frequency of the infra-red light emitted by the laser head has to be doubled to obtain green light that matches the quantum efficiency of the PMTs. YLF stands for Yttrium Lithium Fluoride.

The laser pulse intensity is precisely measured on a pulse-by-pulse basis by photodiodes. The linearity of the photodiode readout electronics is checked with a charge injection system. The response of the photodiodes is monitored with an _Am_24 alpha source, which provides a reference that is stable in time and insensitive to environmental changes.

Footnote 24: The frequency of the infra-red light emitted by the laser head has to be doubled to obtain green light that matches the quantum efficiency of the PMTs. YLF stands for Yttrium Lithium Fluoride.

Laser calibrations are performed generating a train of pulses of increasing amplitude, reaching the upper end of the readout dynamic range. The laser light is transmitted to the PMTs through clear fibers, which are bundled together with the WLS fibers reading the scintillator tiles in the modules (each fiber bundle will contain one clear fiber). The effective dynamic range of the laser in this mode is only about 30, whereas the calorimeter dynamic range in ATLAS is about 60000. To obtain this range a set of remotely con trolled filters will be installed on the laser light path. Amplitude monitoring and timing measurements are made upstream of these filters.

#### Monitoring using the minimum bias events.

LHC detectors will have to cope with a background of inelastic proton-proton collisions at small momentum transfers, that will produce non-negligible occupancies in all detectors. These collisions produce the so-called Minimum Bias (MB) events, which lead to noise in the calorimeters and limit their performance. However, these processes can also be used to continuously monitor the response of the TileCal calorimeter.

The rate of energy deposition by MB processes is proportional to the LHC luminosity and is uniform in azimuthal angle, but is moderately dependent on \(\eta\) over the range spanned by TileCal. It produces a signal in the PMTs that is usually large enough to be recorded by measuring the anode current averaged over a time scale of milliseconds.

The proportionality to the LHC luminosity depends on clean running conditions, i.e. on the absence of appreciable contributions from beam losses due to beam-gas or beam-wall scattering. Under these conditions the average current in each readout cell divided by the instantaneous luminosity gives a number proportional to the overall response of the calorimeter, that should be constant in time. Any variation of the MB current to luminosity ratio can be compared to information from the laser and movable source systems to understand the behavior of the calorimeter in time and correct for it.

The MB signal provides a manner to continuously monitor the response of the calorimeter because it can be read out during physics runs without interfering with normal data acquisition. This is because the quasi-DC component of the PMT anode signal is picked off without disturbing the fast pulse shaper.

#### Source inter calibration and monitoring system.

The Tile Calorimeter is designed to allow a movable \(Cs^{13}\)[7] gamma radioactive source to pass through every scintillator tile, using one of two holes along the symmetry plane of each module. The source guide tube is inserted through one of these holes (see figure 5.2). The radioactive source emits radiation that excites the scintillators. The signal is then integrated and read out, giving information of the cell light yield while the source is traversing the calorimeter. The use of a movable \(\gamma\) source allows to check the quality of the optical response and its uniformity, to equalize the response of all readout cells by adjusting the HV of the corresponding PMT, and to monitor in time the average current of each cell.

Using a JFET-input operational amplifier with an integration time constant of a few _ms_, the signal is converted to a voltage with negligible ripple. In order to clearly see the peak-valley signal structure as the source passes alternatively through steel and scintillator plates, the integration time constant \(\tau\) must be such that \(\tau\ll T\), the time for the source to transverse one period of 18 _mm_. For a source velocity of 300 _mm_/\(s\), \(T=60\)_ms_; a 10 _ms_ integration time turns out to be a reasonable choice. The source-induced current is measured about every 3 _mm_, giving 6 measurements per period, enough to resolve the peak-valley structure. The capability to see individual tiles is due to the fact that the mean free path of the _Cs_[137] gammas (\(E_{\gamma}=0.662\)_MeV_) is only slightly greater than 18 _mm_, which is the separation between tiles.

A typical picture of the source passage through 5 readout cells of the calorimeter is shown in figure 5.3. The multiple peak structure in the response of each PMT is clearly seen. A case of bad light collection from one tile is also spotted out.

The movable source system is the main tool to equalize the response of the calorimeter readout cells within a module, and between different modules. This is done by adjusting the high voltage of each PMT to obtain the same average signal from each cell. The averages are obtained from a computer controlled scan of each cell, giving response curves like those of figure 5.3. The average is simply obtained by summing the measurements over a cell, subtracting the baseline and dividing by the width of the cell. The average response values are measured again at later times, providing information about the stability of the overall calorimeter response and also the cross-calibration information for the analysis of

Figure 5.2: Concept of the source calibration system.

data [14].

A hydraulically driven movable source system allows using just a few sources to calibrate the whole TileCal. For long-term monitoring of the calorimeter response, the precisely known decay rate of the activity of sources must be taken into account.

The design of the movable source system allows to do source scans of the entire TileCal at any desired time after assembly of the full detector. In case a source stops anywhere on its path, it is possible to move it to a safe location without dangerous exposure to people or equipment and without significant loss of time. A full source scan must be done during short beam down periods. This time should not exceed 8 hours. Considering that a path scanning all tiles in the barrel is of approximately 4.000 \(m\) -neglecting interconnections-, this requirement translates into a minimum source velocity of 15 _cm_ /_sec_.

Some requirements on the source system are given next. For cell intercalibration a 5% error on the response of a cell is enough, because a 5% random cell miscalibration would add 1.5% quadratically to the constant term of the energy resolution for pions and less than 1% for jets. However, a \(\sim 1\%\) error is useful to detect changes that could flag the

Figure 5.3: Current measured in the PMTs as a function of the source position along the rod (z axis).

onset of degradation phenomena.

In choosing the source, one must require a \(\gamma\) energy high enough that attenuation through the 1 \(mm\) thick steel tubes will be \(<10\%\), such that the variation of the useful flux due to tolerances on the tube thickness is less than 1%. Also, the lifetime of the source must be sufficiently long to permit at most one replacement over the lifetime of ATLAS, including the construction phase. The activity in a volume not exceeding 5 \(mm^{3}\) should be sufficient to produce average currents of more than 10 \(nA\) at the photo-multiplier anodes. The activity density requirement arises because it is desirable for the source to extend less than 3 \(mm\) - the thickness of scintillating tiles - as illustrated in figure 5.4. The \(Cs^{137}\) isotope (\(E_{\gamma}=0.662\)\(MeV,\ t_{1/2}=30.2\)\(y\)) satisfies all these requirements. The \(Cs^{137}\) from nuclear fuel re-processing is commercially avalaible. It contains a negligible contamination of the short-lived \(Cs^{134}\) isotope (with \(t_{1/2}=2.9\)\(y\)).

##### Source drive system design for ATLAS.

The system is composed of three independent parts, for the barrel and the two extended barrels respectively. These parts are identical in principle and design philosophy, differing only in the details of the layout. Each part is composed of a closed source circuit that passes through every tile of every module, and contains one source.

The drive liquid accesses each circuit through supply/return lines that divide the source circuit into a number of segments. The liquid enters or exits the calorimeter

Figure 5.4: Source location with respect to irradiated tile: the influence of the source length for the efficiency of the system.

through only two of these lines at any time. The moving liquid column spans only a few modules at a time, which keeps the pressure drop across the segment at conservatively low values.

A total of 64 supply/return tubes connect the movable source system to the body of the calorimeter. Within the Tile Calorimeter itself, the main hydraulic components are:

1. The straight calibration tubes passing through the modules.
2. About 2000 curved tube sections, joining the straight tubes to form the source circuits.
3. The tee joints, connecting the supply/return tubes to the source circuit.
4. Three source "garages" in the barrel and two garages in each external barrel. These garages are where the source normally resides and they include mechanisms to lock and release the source.
5. Source passage sensors and local readout electronics.

The general layout of the source circuit and the garages in the barrel is shown in figure 5.5. The supply/return tube bundles are brought to a point at the outer radius of the

Figure 5.5: General source circuit layout for the barrel part of the calorimeter.

Tile Calorimeter and reach the appropriate tee-joints around the external circumference of the barrel. The garages are symmetrically located around the barrel circumference to minimize the time to return the source to a garage (moving in either direction).

#### 5.2.3.2 The Charge Integrator: Front End circuit and readout.

The charge integrator [15] is located on the 3-in-1 card, and is designed to measure the average current of each calorimeter cell due to the energy deposits from the radioactive source, or from MB interactions. The currents from the PMTs are integrated over a time scale which is long enough to suppress the ripple from individual pulses, as well as statistical fluctuations in the amplitude and rate of energy deposits in each cell.

The PMT current induced by 8 \(mCi\ Cs^{137}\) source corresponds mostly to single photoelectrons at a rate of about 4 \(MHz\) giving an average current of about 50 \(nA\) at the nominal PMT gain of \(10^{5}\). The signal variation frequency due to the tile periodicity is 16.7 \(Hz\), for a source velocity of 300 \(mm/s\).

Because the cell intercalibration procedure is based on adding all measurements in a cell, the amplitude of these variations is not critical, however it is important to see properly these oscillations in order to detect optical defects such as broken fibers or bad couplings.

The dynamic range requirements are set by the range of MB currents anticipated as the LHC luminosity increases from an initial value of about \(10^{33}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) to a maximum of \(10^{34}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). The minimum-bias current also varies with radial distance from the interaction point, and with \(\eta\). Taking into account all the dependencies, MB currents in all TileCal cells are expected to span the range between 5 \(nA\) and 500 \(nA\).

The slow current integrator output is digitized by a 12 bit ADC that has an input dynamic range of 5 \(V\). For the \(Cs^{137}\) source calibration, a digitization resolution much better than 1% is achieved but the overall range expected for MB currents does not allow to cover the whole currents range with a resolution of about 1%. Therefore a programmable transimpedance is required to maintain an adequate resolution and its values are chosen according to the calorimeter depth and LHC luminosity (the required resolution is fixed such that the smallest expected minimum bias current will be converted into 40 counts). Using a switched resistor network, six different equivalent integration transimpedances are obtained (2.7, 25, 27.5, 54.3, 72.9 and 99.7 M\(\Omega\) in 3-in-1 version 3.2).

An integrator time constant of 10 \(ms\) is adequate for the source calibration system to limit far below 1% the fluctuations due to the stochastic nature of the source emission. The MB current fluctuations are larger because of the tail of the energy spectra and a time constant of about 100 \(ms\) will be needed. Therefore, a larger time constant is foreseen at the digitizer input stage. All the MB induced currents for a super-drawer can be scanned in a few \(ms\).

The circuit is built around a low cost \(LF411CD\)\(JFET\) input stage operational amplifier (see figure 5.6). Bandwidth and noise are not limiting factors because of the low frequency response of the circuit. The circuit is \(DC\) coupled to the PMT anode through a net that is compatible with the shaper specifications. The programmable gain is achieved with a switched \(T\) feedback network, however the high impedances used make the circuit sensitive to electromagnetic interferences that require careful grounding. Multiplexing is achieved by a local output switch. Commercial CanBus is used as a readout link. The device is controlled by the 3-in-1 controller that sends the appropriate commands through the 3-in-1 CanBus. The commands are decoded and processed by the local logic of the 3-in-1 cards.

## Chapter Assembly of the Extended Barrel calorimeter modules.

In this chapter a general overview of the assembly of the calorimeter and of how a module is "instrumented" with the optical components is presented. A description is given of the quality control steps that are performed on modules during assembly and after completion of assembly. Finally, the reasons for doing an optical quality control of a module, rather than a source calibration, are explained.

### 6.1 The Extended Barrel module assembly and instrumentation at IFAE.

The modular elements of the mechanical assembly of the steel absorber structure of a module, which represents the bulk of the calorimeter absorber, are the sub-modules. The basic geometrical element, called a period, consists of a set of two master plates and one set of spacer plates. This structure is repeated 16 times in the case of a standard sub-module.

The assembly sequence of the submodules consists of surface preparation (roughening) of all plates, washing and drying of the plates, gluing and pre-assembly of the master/spacer sets, and assembly of the latter in a precision press. Once the adhesive has cured, four steel union pieces are MIG-welded in the corners (figure 6.1). The completed submodule is immersion-painted in a dedicated painting station, which guarantees paint surface uniformity by pumping away the paint to a storage tank at constant velocity. Thesubmodule assembly cycle takes about 3 days per submodule.

A mechanically-assembled module consists of 8 standard submodules, a slightly smaller one, all built by IFAE or by IFIC-Valencia, and a special-geometry submodule (known as ITC) built at the University of Texas in Arlington. These 10 submodules are bolted on a welded and precision-machined "girder" structure, together with an end plate. A front plate (at the inner radius in the assembled calorimeter) is arc-welded. This is followed by envelope measurements to check the quality of the assembled module.

Once the module has been mechanically assembled, it has to be instrumented with all the scintillators (about 1500) and the fibers (about 1750) which collect the scintillator light (figure 6.2). The principal steps of module instrumentation are:

* Gluing into the girder the plastic rings into which the fiber bundles will be secured.
* Inserting the scintillator tiles (provided by IHEP-Protvino).
* Inserting the extruded profiles [16], each of which carries three or four WLS fibers, to make contact with the scintillators. Fibers are pre-inserted into the profiles in Coimbra, after being cut, polished and aluminized at one end in Lisbon.
* Sorting the fibers into bundles, each of which will be routed through a girder ring to a PMT.

Figure 6.1: A sub-module being welded before its extraction from the press.

* Checking that all fibers are routed to the appropriate PMT, by illuminating the fibers from the source calibration hole and then from inside the girder.
* Adding clear fibers (for laser monitoring of PMT gain) and "filler" fibers where needed.
* Gluing the fibers into a permanent assembly.
* Cutting and polishing the glued bundles. Polishing is performed by a diamond cutter, driven through the girder cavity.
* Passing a miniature video camera through the girder cavity, verifying that all fibers present a luminous and polished surface (figure 6.3).

At this point, the module is considered to be finished and is ready for its last inspection: the optical quality control. After this step, the module is ready to leave the production line to be prepared for transportation to CERN.

Figure 6.2: View of a TileCal module after being instrumented. It is prepared to be optically qualified.

### 6.2 Quality control during module instrumentation.

Several quality control steps are performed during module assembly and instrumentation [17]. All quality control results are reported in writing and all the tasks that have been performed are described. The quality control reports contain what batches of materials were used, the results of tests and checks, any problems that were encountered and what repairs were made. This is the main source of information for avoiding (or solving) instrumentation problems. The quality control steps performed during module instrumentation are:

1. _QC0 \(\rightarrow\) Module preparation:_ A global inspection of the assembled module is done to check for any problems during the assembly not detected previously. The main checks are spot glue remaining in the slots, burrs on weld bars at the edge of the girder or abnormal spacing between submodules.
2. _QC1 \(\rightarrow\) Tile Inspection:_ The scintillators (delivered in packs of 20 tiles) are checked before and after insertion in the module. Before inserting them it is checked that the tiles have a blue color similar to the standard tile when back-lit with a fluorescent light or a normal lamp. Also tile end surfaces are inspected: they should be clean and undamaged. After tiles have been inserted into the module, it must be checked that all tiles have

Figure 6.3: View of a polished bundle in the aspirin tube captured by the miniature video camera.

the correct size and are centered in slots. Also, tile wrappers should not extend beyond the tile end surfaces.
3. _QC2 \(\rightarrow\) Verify fiber lengths and sorting_: Check that the WLS fibers that belong to the same cell have the same length. Also, it is checked that the sequential groups of fibers of the same length correspond to cell geometries. A light source is inserted in the source holes in order to verify that the fibers have been sorted into the correct depth group. By direct observation, fibers that give abnormally low light are replaced.
4. _QC3 \(\rightarrow\) Verify routing with a light source_: All fiber sub-bundles on both sides of the module are inspected. For each TileRow, a 3 \(m\) long metacrylate tube, containing a row of small incandescent bulbs, is inserted into the module. Upon turning on the appropriate bulbs, the lamps illuminate all tiles and fibers of each cell. It is checked that all of the fibers that belong to the illuminated cells are lit and that none from the other cells are lit.
5. _QC4 \(\rightarrow\) Check for damaged fibers:_ Before gluing the fibers into the aspirin tubes, the WLS fibers are inspected from the point where they exit the profile to the point where they enter the aspirin tube. Broken fibers or fibers with damaged cladding are replaced.
6. _QC5 \(\rightarrow\) Inspect the fiber ends:_ Once the fibers have been glued into the aspirin tubes and have been cut and polished, the polished fiber ends are checked with a miniature video camera inserted into the girder. The epoxy surfaces should be completely cured, mirror smooth, and without scratches or chips.
7. _QC6 \(\rightarrow\) Optical QC test and Certification:_ The whole module is scanned by inserting either a \(Cs^{13}\)[7] source or a LED in the source tubes, recording the signal from the PMTs as the source/LED traverses each tile. The main purpose is to check the quality of the optical response of the modules. All tile-fiber couplings which give low signals are repaired, damaged fibers are replaced and tiles of poor quality are also replaced.

### Why optical quality control and not source calibration?

All TileCal calorimeter modules that are produced are inspected with a special readout drawer, one at every instrumentation site. Due to the front-end electronics schedule, it is not possible to equip a constructed module directly in the assembly line with its own drawer, because production drawers will only be available in 2001. However, for the final setup in the ATLAS pit, each module will have its final drawer, which implies a new set of PMTs with different gains for the same High Voltages. Moreover, Extended Barrel modules have to be transported to CERN, and during the trip changes in response or optical damage may arise. Therefore a final calibration cannot take place at the Extended Barrel assembly laboratories. For this reason it was decided to make only an optical quality control of modules. The final modules calibration can only be done from 2001 onwards, at CERN.

#### Using a blue LED to inspect the quality of a module.

A light source was suggested as a possible alternative to \(Cs^{13}\)[17] for the quality control of the uniformity of the optical response of a module during its production. The use of a light source - specifically, a blue LED that excites scintillation light in the WLS fibers but not in the tiles themselves - was tested at IFAE in early 1999 [18]. Using a sub-module of the calorimeter, it was found that the light signal correlated with only 9% deviations (_rms_ value) with the signal produced by the Cs\({}^{137}\) source. The main advantage of the light source system, in comparison to the previously used radioactive source, is that it does not require assembly activities to be suspended (to avoid radiation exposure) and allows module construction (on one assembly station) to proceed together with the check of another module on the other assembly station, without interruptions.

During the past years IFAE has acquired considerable experience in using a movable source for the calibration system; hence it was well-known how to develop a system for production optical quality control. At the IFAE and MSU assembly halls it was decided to use blue LEDs as a light source to inspect the quality of the constructed modules. At CERN and ANL, the \(Cs^{13}\) source is used to do this last quality check.

As will be discussed later (see chapter 9), experience has shown that use of an LED to check modules is only partially effective in finding variations is scintillator light yield.

## Chapter 7 The optical Quality Control system at IFAE.

After a module is fully instrumented, any defect or error that occurred during instrumentation must be flagged or corrected. To do this, a blue LED coupled to a diffuser is used to systematically check the optical quality of the calorimeter. The main piece of the quality control system, which is shown in figure 7.1, is an automatic tile-scanning machine that exposes each tile and each fiber to the LED light. A special QC drawer is used for the readout of the PMTs. The time stability of the PMT gains, together with the stability of the LED light yield by the diffuser, are measured with a separate tool, the Gain Monitor. The light source system operates under a dark room that is moved as needed from one module assembly station to the other. The main components of the system will be discussed in the next subsections.

### 7.1 The blue LED diffuser characteristics.

The light source used to inspect a calorimeter module consists of a blue LED (NICHIA type NSPB -310A [19], with maximum emission at 470 _nm_). Because its electrodes have no circular symmetry, a light diffuser is required to have light emitted with azimuthal homogeneity. The diffusing material is an epoxy (Araldit Rapid) that fills a metacrylate tube 29 _mm_ long and 5 _mm_ wide. The LED is glued to one end of the tube while black ink covers the other end to avoid forward light emission. Two metal cylinders are glued outside the plastic tube and are separated by a 3 _mm_-wide window, which defines the exit path of the diffused light. A schematic view of the diffuser is shown in figure 7.2.

The motion of the diffuser inside the module is driven by a flexible plastic tube attached to the diffuser, which contains the two power wires for the LED and is flexible enough to be bent to a radius of \(\sim 5\;cm\) on the plastic tube takeup drum.

The azimuthal uniformity of the light emitted by the diffuser depends strongly upon the accuracy of the diffuser window width around its circumference and the air bubbles that remain in the epoxy, which help to diffuse the light emitted by the LED. The azimuthal uniformity of a diffuser was measured with the Gain Monitor (see section 7.3) and was found to be \((2.1\pm 0.5)\%\) (\(rms\) value, see figure 7.3). The design of the diffuser has been improved since the first diffuser tests, where an azimuthal uniformity of \(8\%\) was

Figure 7.1: View of the optical quality control setup.

Figure 7.2: Schematic view of the diffuser.

found [18]. The azimuthal non-uniformity is one of the sources of error which can affect the individual tile response measurements (due to assembly tolerances, it may differ from one diffuser to another).

Good stability of the current through the LED is required in order to have a constant light yield. This is obtained using a regulated Voltage Power Supply (EuroTest LAB/SL120 [20]) connected to the LED via 3 M\(\Omega\) resistor. This resistor also fixes the forward current to be within the LED normal operation range; the light yield is sufficient even using the lowest integrator gain available. The fact that \(R_{LED}\ll R\) ensures the stability needed for the LED current. The warm-up time for the LED to achieve the desired stability of the light yield was found to be about 20 minutes.

When charged particles go through the calorimeter, the light to the fibers is the scintillation light produced in the tiles. When the LED is used to test a module, the scintillator acts only as a light guide, due to the fact that the LED spectra does not match either scintillation dopant of the tiles (see figure 7.4). This will reveal tile-fiber coupling defects, but we must keep in mind that problems related to the scintillation processes are not going to be detected by the LED system. The only scintillation processes excited in

Figure 7.3: LED azimuthal light uniformity measured with the Gain Monitor. The phase between the two PMT responses is due to the geometry of the light collecting fibers in the Gain Monitor.

this mode are due to the WLS fibers, which shift the blue spectra to a longer wavelength.

### 7.2 Properties of the Extender.

The mechanical device that drives the diffuser into the module is known as the "Extender". The diffuser travels through transparent plexiglas tubes inserted into the source calibration holes (to guide the \(Cs^{137}\) source, metallic tubes are used instead). These plastic tubes cross all the scintillators in a TileRow; one of the holes of the tiles is used. The "Extender" also provides the vertical motion of the diffuser between the 11 TileRows of the module. The machine was designed by Lluis Miralles and its control electronics was designed by Georges Blanchot. A photograph and a schematic view are shown in figure 7.5 and figure 7.6 respectively.

Using a DC motor, the Extender moves the diffuser through the module at a constant speed that can be chosen in the range of \((0.1-100.0)\)_mm_/_s_. The plastic tube which drives the diffuser is \(3.15\)_m_ long and is totally rolled up on the takeup drum before the diffuser is inserted. As the drum rotates, the diffuser is inserted into the plexiglas tube. The diffuser traverses the module with the selected velocity and returns to the garage

Figure 7.4: The blue LED NSPB-310A spectra measured at IFAE.

position at the maximum velocity. The diffuser velocity is stable to \((0.36\pm\,0.07)\%\) at the chosen operating value of \(37.5\)\(\mathit{mm}/s\).

A separate motor produces the vertical motion of the Extender from one TileRow to another, which takes \(\sim 15\)\(s\) per TileRow. Inductive sensors stop the vertical movement when the Extender is at each of 11 positions appropriate for diffuser insertion. The sensors

Figure 7.6: Schematic view of the “Extender”.

Figure 7.5: View of the “Extender”.

are arranged according to a binary code, giving the position of the Extender at each stop. Other sensors check that the diffuser is in the "garage" position, i.e. that it is fully rolled up when the takeup drum moves vertically. All this information is used in to initialize the setup to make a full scan of a module. Safety sensors are used to stop and block the system if the diffuser is about to exceed the maximum horizontal scanning distance or if the machine is about to exceed the minimum or maximum vertical limits.

### 7.3 Purpose and description of the Gain Monitor.

The Gain Monitor is a device that complements the optical Quality Control setup. It allows to separately track in time the diffuser light output and the gain of the PMTs in the QC drawer. Monitoring these quantities should allow to factor them out of the QC signals and recognize changes in optical response from module to module.

The Gain Monitor, schematically shown in figure 7.7, is mechanically formed by a housing for a drawer, a holder for the LED diffuser, and a collimating shield for a \(Sr^{90}\) radioactive source. The light emitted by the diffuser is collected by 28 fibers and each of them is brought to illuminate a particular PMT of the drawer. At the PMT end, the

Figure 7.7: Schematic view of the Gain Monitor.

The gain Monitor system is designed to measure both LED and radioactive source signals. The PMT gain and LED dependences in time are measured relative to the source signal. Beyond the design requirements of the Gain Monitor, the system offers the possibility of studying the azimuthal light yield uniformity for the diffusers, by simply rotating the diffuser inside the garage with the help of a specific tool. The stability results obtained with the Gain Monitor will be discussed in section 8.5.

Figure 7.8: a) Schematic view of the diffuser placement on the Gain Monitor and b) the diffuser holder, where the fibers collect the LED light (no fibers are placed behind the rods).

### 7.4 Last but not least: the DAQ software architecture.

To remotely control the components of the quality control system, a PC station with a \(PII\) 350 CPU, 256 \(MBytes\) of RAM and running under \(Windows\)\(NT\) is used. The quality control setup is mounted inside a dark room and the PC is located near the dark room. With this PC, the drawer, the Extender PLCs, the LED, all the power supplies and temperature and humidity sensors are controlled. Both serial ports, a CanBus control card and a DAQ Board are used to perform control tasks:

* Serial ports: they are used to communicate with the PLCs of the Extender, via \(COMMS\) communication protocol. The velocity of the LED insertion and all the Extender movements are controlled.

Figure 7.9: View of the main control GUI to perform the optical quality control of the Extended Barrel modules constructed and instrumented at IFAE.

* \(National\ Instruments\ PCI-CAN/2\) Board [21]: it provides \(2\ CanBus\) lines and it is used to interface with the HV distributor and with the 3-in-1 cards of the drawer, as well as the ADC, which digitizes the values read by the 3-in-1 integrators.
* \(National\ Instruments\ Card\ AT-MIO-16E-10\) Board [22]: it is used to monitor the temperature and humidity sensors (\(Design\ Instruments\ THR-370/AM\)) and to control the Power Supplies (1 kV \(American\ HV\) unit and a \(VICOR\ PFC\ MegaPAC\) to provide the LV).

\(LabView\) 5.0 [23] was chosen as the main software platform for the Data Acquisition [24][25] (see front panel on figure 7.9). Two external executables written in \(C_{++}\) are called from the \(LabView\) shell, and work in real-time through the CERN \(Wi32\) software package. These executables control the setting of the 3-in-1 card gains and the ADC readout. Another \(LabView\) based program (\(qbench\)), provided by the Clermont-Ferrand group, is used to set and monitor the PMT voltages. The main analysis program is written in \(Fortran\ \ 90\) and is also interfaced to the \(LabView\) shell. It takes about 20 minutes to make a complete LED scan of a given module. After such a scan, monitor files and a standard Ntuple are produced with both raw and processed data. Also, \(ASCII\) files containing the raw data are stored.

The main optical quality control Web page1 is updated after each module QC is done. This site includes all of the relevant information about the properties of each Extended Barrel module instrumented at IFAE.

## Chapter 8 Optical QC of Extended Barrel modules instrumented at IAE.

To prepare a calorimeter module for the optical quality control [26], the drawer is inserted into the girder, the Extender is fixed to the end plate and plexiglas tubes are inserted into the calibration tube holes. A movable dark room is placed around the module, the Extender and the drawer are cabled up, humidity and temperature sensors are installed, and finally any light leak into the dark room is eliminated.

The following operations are performed during the optical quality control:

* Checking the response of the laser fibers.
* Scanning the module with a blue LED to spot optical faults.
* Repairing any faults, typically arising from tile-fiber couplings, individual fibers or tiles.
* Performing another scan after the repairs to check that faults have been corrected (if not, more effort is spent to correct them).

Once the module is optically certified, Gain Monitor measurements are taken. The Extender and related hardware are dismounted and the module is prepared for shipping to the storage area at CERN. Optical quality control takes about 3 working days. In the next sections, the quality control steps are described in detail, and the experience with the first 18 of 65 Extended Barrel modules to be constructed at IFAE is reviewed.

### Check of laser fibers.

Clear fibers, bundled together with the WLS fibers, are used to transmit the laser light to the PMTs. These fibers are grouped together in an optical connector (designed and built at the University of Coimbra) which receives the laser light from one fiber, as in the final ATLAS setup. There are two such connectors, one on each side of the module. Each connector is illuminated from the input end with a blue LED, identical to that used for the module scans. The only requirement is to see a signal above pedestal in all PMTs. Typically the signal obtained saturates the integrator output of all or most PMTs.

The High Voltages applied to the PMTs are listed in figure 8.2. They were chosen, at the beginning of module production, to minimize the variations between the cell responses of the module during the LED scan. The LED current is typically \(\sim 4\mu A\) and the minimum 3-in-1 gain is used (corresponding to a 7.5 M\(\Omega\) feedback resistance for this

3-in-1 version). Fibers which do not propagate the light must be replaced. For the 18 instrumented modules, only one laser fiber with a low response was detected (module IFA004, cell \(A\)12 odd). Light was lost because the fiber did not arrive to the bundle end of the aspirin tube.

### 8.2 Scanning a module with the blue LED diffuser.

The entire module scan then follows. The data acquisition parameters are listed in table 8.1. In this configuration, 2 measurements per _mm_ are taken, which is amply sufficient to resolve the Individual Tile Responses (ITRs). Measurements with more than 2 \(samples/mm\) were also taken. They showed that the precision achieved in measuring the ITRs did not improve [27].

#### Single tile response evaluation: spotting optical faults.

Because of the mean-free-path of the _Cs_[13, 13] photons in the calorimeter structure, the response as the _Cs_[13] radioactive source scans the module has contributions from more than one neighboring tile. Therefore, an unfolding method to extract the individual tile responses is needed (see section 9.1.2). This is not the case when the module is scanned

Figure 8.2: GUI of the \(qbench\) LabView software which shows the High Voltages applied to the drawer PMTs.

by the blue LED. The response of the LED displays no leakage to the neighboring tiles, as can be seen in figure 8.3. The ITR is defined as the area below each peak, after subtraction of the pedestal.

To look for optical faults, _e.g._ bad tile-fiber couplings, damaged fibers or poor quality tiles, the so-called "drop" variable is defined. It is the deviation of the \(ith\) ITR (\(I_{i}\)) from the mean value of all the ITRs inside a cell within a TileRow (\(<I>\)). This variable is normalized to the mean value of ITRs (\(<I>\)) and it is expressed as a percentage:

\[Drop_{i}\ (\%)\ =\ (1\ -\ \frac{I_{i}}{<I>})\cdot 100 \tag{8.1}\]

On one of the first modules produced, detailed repeatability studies were done, using

Figure 8.3: An example of the data as the light source transverses a cell within a TileRow.

\end{table}

10 complete module scans. The repeatability of the individual tile responses was found to be \((1.5\pm 0.3)\%\). The repeatability of the "drop" variable, used to flag the optical faults, was of \((0.6\pm 0.2)\%\).

Several sources of instrumental errors which can affect our measurements were investigated. The variation of the LED light yield, which may arise from drift on the LED current and/or inhomogeneities on azimuthal light emission, was measured with the Gain Monitor to be \((2.1\pm 0.5)\%\). Using the _qbench_ software, the High Voltage drifts were measured to be about 0.2%, which implies about 1.2% variations of the PMT gains. The LED velocity changes were measured from the variations of the distance peak-to-peak. They were found to be of \((0.36\pm 0.07)\%\) when the LED travels at \(37.5\,\mathit{mm}\,/s\). The offline software threshold parameter, to automatically find the peaks over all the raw data, contributes to the "drop" \((0.05\pm 0.02)\%\), if one varies this parameter value over its practical range. The electronic noise is \((0.42\pm 0.08)\) ADC counts and is a minor contribution.

During the first scan of the module, it is checked that the numbers of peaks found within all cells are correct. This assures that the fibers have been properly routed. Next, the ITRs with drops greater than 30% are investigated (since module IFA009 all "drops" greater than 25% are investigated and repaired). The offline software package provides a list with all the optical faults found (figure 8.4), and their likely origin. This automatic diagnosis is based on a few simple considerations: similar drops for tiles read by the same fiber indicate a fiber fault; drops correlated on left-right ITRs responses indicate a possible problem in the corresponding tiles; uncorrelated drops are usually related to bad tile-fiber couplings. These problems are investigated and repaired to bring all drops to be below 25%. In the next subsection, faults found on the first 18 modules and the actions taken are described in some detail [28].

\end{table}

### 8.3 Optical faults found and corrective actions.

Table 8.3 shows the number of faults found before and after optical repairs for the first 18 modules instrumented and tested at IFAE. With a drop threshold of 25%, the problems found were related to bad tile-fiber couplings for 70% of cases, to the fibers themselves for 26% of cases and to the scintillators for 4% of the cases. As the table shows, the number of faults per module decreased with time and experience with the instrumentation process.

Note that the modules IFA001-008 have a higher number of faults after repair because the drop threshold for repair was 30% at the time. A detailed description of faults and their corrections follows.

**- Tile-fiber coupling faults:**

1. **Profiles are not well introduced into the slot between master plates:**

Figure 8.4: An example of the optical faults list automatically provided by the offline software package at the end of a module scan.

**Description:** In some cases, when the profile is placed into the slot, it does not fit properly into it so that the fiber remains at some distance from the scintillator. This tends to occur at the inner calorimeter radius, where profile insertion begins.
**Solution:** This fault is easy to confirm by touching profiles: those which do not fit well are loose. It can be solved by extracting and putting the profile again into the groove. If the problem persists, one can add aluminum tape to improve the coupling. In cases where the space for the tile was excessive, thin aluminum plate can be inserted into the scintillator slot to fix the problem.
**Considerations:** As a consequence of the cutting method, the master plates have curved edges on one side. It is more likely that the profile fits loosely into the slot if it is between two curved edges [29]. Also, it is important to periodically check and

tune the profile insertion tool. If it is damaged, a large fraction of the profiles may have this problem. **Statistics and problem evaluation:** 31 faults of this type were detected, with drops from 30% to 100%. After the actions were taken, the drop was not brought to a value below 25% in 6 cases.
2. **Fiber nested between iron and scintillator: Description:** When a profile is introduced into the slot, the fiber may lose its center position within the profile. In this case it may get caught between iron and scintillator, remaining trapped there. **Solution:** Take out the profile and put it back gently pulling the fiber to keep it at the center of the profile. **Considerations:** This was the most frequent problem of the Barrel module0 [30]. In some cases, the fiber cladding can be scratched and the fiber must be replaced. **Statistics and problem evaluation:** 10 faults of this type were detected, with drops from 50% to 100%. In all cases, the drop was brought to a value below 25%.

Figure 8.5: A tile-fiber coupling fault observed to have an excessively low response in comparison with the other ITRs in a cell within a TileRow.

3. **Fiber not well centered:** **Description:** In this case the fiber is not nested between iron and scintillator but displaced from the center of the slot. When the fiber is significantly off center, the light coupling to the scintillator is less efficient. **Solution:** Same as in case 2, above. **Considerations:** On \(D\) cells, the possibly large curvature of fibers at the exit of the profile favors this problem. Low bundle curvature of fiber exit from the profile must be kept when routing fibers. **Statistics and problem evaluation:** 4 faults of this type were detected, with drops from 30% to 50%. After the actions were taken, the drop was not brought to a value below 25% in only 1 case.

**- Fiber faults:**

1. **Fiber does not reach the bundle end:** **Description:** The curvature of fiber bundles near the aspirin tube may make fibers slip away from the end of the tube. After they are glued, that results in fiber not reaching the end of the bundle; in this case, there is a substantial loss of light transmission to the PMT. **Solution:** On the first two modules instrumented, the solution adopted was to cut the fiber and splice it to a dummy fiber glued in the aspirin tube. Splicing was indicated only when the drop was higher than 50%. A new method was reported by Lluis Miralles at the February 2000 Atlas week after successfully testing it at IFAE. A thin (1.5 _mm_\(\phi\)) teflon tube is glued into a bundle, much like a dummy fiber. After the glue cures, the teflon tube is removed, leaving a hole through which a new fiber can be glued. After gluing and polishing the new fibers, the drops are completely recovered. This method is now used in all instrumentation sites. **Considerations:** Spliced fibers typically still had drops of about 45%. By using the teflon tube technique, complete drop recovery was achieved. **Statistics and problem evaluation:** 9 faults of this type were detected, with drops from 35% to 85%. 4 spliced fibers remain with drops \(\sim\)45%, while in all cases where fibers were replaced by the teflon tube technique the drop was brought to a value below 25%.
2. **Short Fibers:** **Description:** In some cases, the fiber glue joint within the profile comes unstuck and the fiber partially slides down the profile. Therefore only a fraction of the tile is coupled to the fiber, with a loss of light collection. In other cases, it was the fiber itself that was not glued at the proper position. **Solution:** The fiber is pushed back to the proper position inside the profile. If the fiber is too short, one may have to replace it. **Considerations:** In some cases, it is useful to fasten the fiber end to the profile with a drop of glue. **Statistics and problem evaluation:** 4 faults of this type were detected, with drops from 30% to 100%. After the actions were taken, the drop was not brought

to a value below 25% in only 1 case.
3. **Fiber damage: Description:** In a few cases, the fibers were found to be deformed and/or the cladding mechanically damaged. Some of these faults were due to a problem at the fiber insertion machine in Coimbra. **Solution n:** Repairs were made using the teflon tube technique. **Considerations:** The profile insertion machine in Coimbra was re-tuned and the problem was corrected. **Statistics and problem evaluation:** 9 faults of this type were detected, with drops from 30% to 65%. In some cases the fiber damage was not repaired because the damage does not affect to the physics performance of the detector (see section 8.4). 5 of these fibers were not repaired.
4. **Routing errors: Description:** When a module is instrumented an error on fiber routing produces cells with the wrong number of fibers. **Solution n:** With proper quality control during instrumentation, the problem is detected before the fibers are glued into the aspirin tubes. One has simply to extract fibers from the aspirin tube and to re-route the fibers again. The problem is more serious when the mis-routing is detected after gluing the fibers. In this case one has to extract the profiles and the aspirin tubes affected and replace them. **Statistics and problem evaluation:** A mis-routing for cells B12 and B13 (even side) was found for the first module instrumented at IFAE (IFA002). It was corrected by changing the profiles and aspirin tubes.
5. **Scratched Fiber Ends: Description:** Scratches found on the polished face of fibers at the end of the aspirin tube. **Solution n:** Re-polish the fiber ends to achieve a good quality fiber surface. **Considerations:** This may happen in case of irregular operation of the cutting/polishing machine. Sometimes the machine stops inside the girder before the cutting cycle is complete. In these cases, the aspirin tubes and the quality of the polished fibers must be checked.

**Statistics and problem evaluation:** 3 aspirin tubes with scratched fiber ends, for modules IFA017 and IFA018. Good quality of fiber surface was achieved in all cases after re-polishing.

**- Scintillator faults:**

1. **Non-uniformity of scintillator quality:**

**Description:** Two different types of faults were observed: 1. Occasionally a tile with low light transmission is encountered. In this case the two fibers coupled to each side of the tile have a similar light loss (correlation between left and right PMT responses). 2. In a TileRow, a mix of packs of scintillators with different optical properties may occur.

**Solution:** If packs of tiles with very different light yield properties have been inserted, the solution is to open profiles and replace all the scintillators.

**Considerations:** This problem has been extensively studied. Tile selection criteria have been developed to avoid large differences in optical responses within a cell (the measurements and the method to sort tiles into are explained in detail in chapter 9).

**Statistics and problem evaluation:** The two major occurrences spotted with the LED were: _(a)_ in module IFA002, two sets of tiles used for cell D6 (TileRow 10), _(b)_ in module IFA008, cell A13 (TileRow 2), 10 Tiles were replaced (as shown in figure 8.7).
2. **Scintillator** **Tyvek envelope displaced:**

**Description:** The Tyvek which covers the tile is displaced when the tile is inserted into module. In other cases, the Tyvek is exfoliated. In both situations, the source hole is partially obscured by the Tyvek.

**Solution:** Extract the scintillator and insert it again having correctly placed (or replaced) the envelope.

**Considerations:** In this case, no correlation is found between left and right PMT responses if the envelope masks only one side of the source hole. The faults may bemisdiagnosed as a fiber coupling problem. With experience, it has become customary to extract and inspect the corresponding scintillator if a drop on one fiber only is not cured by carefully re-inserting the profile. **Statistics and problem evaluation:** 4 cases detected, with drops near 30% in case of paper displacement and drops near 50% in case of exfoliated paper. In all cases, the drop was brought to a value below 25%.
3. **Chipped scintillators: Description:** We have found scintillators that are chipped on one side of the source hole. The fracture looks like it is due to the impact of a sharp object. In this case the fiber coupled on this side gave low signal. **Solution n:** The problem is solved by replacing the tile. **Considerations:** One tile chipped on one side would look like a bad tile-fiber

Figure 8.7: Correlation on left and right PMT signals are found when some tiles in a TileRow give low/high responses. In this case, 10 tiles were replaced and a coupling was also repaired.

coupling. However, this could not be cured by realigning the fiber to the tile. Chipped tiles are detected by direct observation.
**Statistics and problem evaluation:** 3 cases detected, with drops near 45 %. In all cases, the drop was brought to a value below 25%.

### 8.4 Overall evaluation of modules.

Moving beyond diagnosis and repair of optical faults, it is even more interesting and useful to study whether intrinsic non-uniformities of the optical response of the instrumented modules would produce substantial effects in the detected physics [31][32]. For this purpose, the global uniformity of the module and the uniformity within cells must be checked. Also, MonteCarlo studies of pions and muons suggest criteria of module evaluation, by showing how physics performance depends on module non-uniformities.

In this section, results on the first 18 Extended Barrel modules instrumented at IFAE are compared to the indications from these MonteCarlo studies.

#### Overall module uniformity.

The overall uniformity of Individual Tile Responses (ITRs) of a module is a useful parameter to characterize its optical quality. The distribution of ITRs, for one module before and after repairs, is shown is figure 8.8. All the individual tile responses are normalized to the mean response in the TileRow within a cell, to which each ITR belongs. This normalization is done to cancel out the effect of tile size, PMT gain and fiber length dependences. On these plots, an asymmetry is clearly seen. It indicates that at the lower end a fraction of the ITRs is anomalously low; however, these cases cannot be separated from the tail of the distribution.

The _rms_ of the distribution is used to estimate the goodness of the optical response of the module, which improves after the optical repairs. Part of the distribution is fitted to a Gaussian to obtain the standard deviation as an overall uniformity estimator for the module. Typically, this values are around 4.5% for the LED scans. The scintillation processes, not seen by LED, make the distribution broader and for \(Cs^{137}\) scans the Gaussian \(\sigma\) is slightly increased (see section 9.1.3). A summary of all these measurements for all modules instrumented at IFAE is shown in figure 8.9. It can be shown that if the _rms_ of the response distribution is kept below 10 %, the constant term of the calorimeter resolution for hadrons will not be affected. Therefore it is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition that the normalized ITR distribution have _rms_\(<\)10%. This condition was met for all modules.

Figure 8.8: Distributions for all normalized ITRs of the module IFA017, before and after optical repairs.

Figure 8.9: Summary plot for all modules instrumented at IFAE, where the uniformity measurements are shown.

Two problems which appeared during production affected the uniformity of some modules. For module IFA003, the profile insertion tool was worn out and profiles were not compressed enough into the slots, resulting in degraded uniformity comparing with the rest of modules. The insertion tool was then replaced by one of a sturdier design. For modules IFA006 and IFA007, several damaged fibers were detected. These problems disappeared after re-tuning the fiber insertion into profiles at Coimbra.

At the time of the blue LED scans, the PMT gains are not set to equalize the cell responses as precisely as in \(Cs^{137}\) calibration scans. To study the calorimeter response over different TileRows, it is necessary to cancel out the PMT gain dependences. This is done by normalizing all the ITRs in a TileRow within a cell to the mean value of all ITRs in a cell. In figure 8.10, the average response over TileRows is shown. After data normalization, the response variations among TileRows within a sampling are around 5%. This is expected from the differences in tile sizes and fiber lengths belonging to TileRows. For sampling 3, the variation is slightly bigger due to the higher response given by the TileRow 9. This effect might be due to a relatively higher transmission of light in tiles of row 9.

Figure 8.10: Response average over TileRows for the 18 Extended Barrel modules instrumented at IFAE. The error bar represent the _rms_ of the average taken over each module.

#### Quality of the 1st and 2nd sampling.

The requirements on the quality of the 1rst and 2nd samplings derive mainly from the repercussion of the non-uniformity on the measurement of the energy of isolated pions. In ATLAS, most of the pion shower energy is deposited the first and second sampling of the Tile Cal calorimeter, compared to the third sampling.

The observed optical responses in the Module0's served as a basis for a MonteCarlo simulation of the pion response. A study of the effect of the uniformity of the response on the calorimeter performance for pions was carried out [33]. Pions were simulated with the Detector Integration CodE (DICE) [34], developed as an interface to the GEANT package [35], including a detailed TileCal geometry description.

The study established criteria in the uniformity among cells and within a cell for a good physics performance of the calorimeter. The _rms_ of the response of all TileRows of the 1998 Module0 was 5%. It is shown that such a dispersion has only a marginal effect on the resolution. From figure 8.11 a deterioration of the constant term is observed when the _rms_ reaches 10%. This also occurs, when the response of an individual tile row of the 1rst and the 2nd sampling deviates more than 20% from the average.

The _rms_ of the response for cells of 1st and 2nd sampling for the 18 Extended barrel

Figure 8.11: Energy resolution for different _rms_’s for all TileRow responses. A deterioration of the constant term is observed when the _rms_ reaches 10%.

modules instrumented at IFAE is shown in figure 8.12. After the optical faults were repaired, the mean value of the \(rms\) for all the modules is \((4.3\pm 2.0)\%\), which satisfies the above requirement. Only 3 cells have \(rms\) slightly above 10%. This small tail is acceptable. Even though the uniformity within a group of tiles in a TileRow within a cell improves after optical repairs, from the plot it is seen that imperfections in the optical response, once they have been repaired, do not affect significantly the cell uniformity.

#### Quality of the 3rd sampling.

The most stringent criteria for the uniformity of the 3rd sampling comes from muon detection, due to its relevance for the LVL1 trigger [36][37]. Muons were simulated, as pions, with the Detector Integration CodE (DICE) [34]. Muon simulations showed that the individual tile-fiber pair response could affect muon detection in the 3rd sampling [18]. Therefore, the ITR uniformity in the 3rd sampling needs particular attention during optical QC. The impact on the efficiency for identifying muons of a locally degraded optics response is shown in figure 8.13.

The number of fibers in each row that is crossed by a muon varies from 10 to 15 fibers per TileRow in the Extended Barrel modules. A single broken fiber has essentially no

Figure 8.12: Cell \(rms\)’s in percentage for 1st and 2nd sampling of the 18 Extended Barrel instrumented at IFAE.

effect, and it may not be necessary to repair every single broken fiber in the 3rd sampling. In ATLAS, the gain of the PMTs will be adjusted to equalize the average response of the cells, but irregularities in the couplings could locally affect the muon efficiency.

For all modules, special attention has been devoted to optical faults in the 3rd sampling. The non-uniformities in the tile-fiber couplings within a cell for the 3rd sampling for

all 18 instrumented modules are shown in figure 8.14. An improvement in the uniformity on the response of tiles in a cell within a TileRow is obtained after repairing the optical faults flagged by the LED system. The 3rd sampling mean _rms_ for the instrumented modules is of \((6.0\pm 1.6)\%\).

### 8.5 First Gain Monitor results.

After module scans and all repairs are finished, the drawer is inserted into the Gain Monitor and data are taken. As pointed out above, the purpose of the Gain Monitor is to measure the PMT gain and LED light yield variations in time by using the LED and a _Sr\({}^{90}\)_ radioactive source.

Before starting systematic measurements, several special runs were taken to study the errors which could affect the experimental data [38]. It was found that the repeatability of the LED signal for the LED extraction/insertion in the LED holder was approximately \((1.5\pm 1.0)\%\). The repeatability of the source signal after extraction/insertion of the _Sr\({}^{90}\)_ source on the Gain Monitor was 0.9% and 0.3% for PMTs 3 and 4 respectively. A stability of 0.5% was found over 25 minutes of data taking. The warm up of the Gain Monitor electronics was chosen to be five minutes. Negligible changes were observed when extracting/inserting the drawer into the Gain Monitor.

#### Gain Monitor operation.

The drawer is extracted from the module and introduced into the Gain Monitor. Then, the LED/diffuser assembly is fully moved out of the Extender and inserted into its holder.

The first measurement is made without the _Sr\({}^{90}\)_ source, to establish the pedestals of PMTs 3 and 4. Then, the source is placed into its enclosure and the response of PMTs 3 and 4 to the scintillator irradiated by the source is measured. The maximum integrator gain (99.7 M\(\Omega\)) is used for the signal and pedestal measurements. The source is left on for the next steps. The LED measurements follow. Pedestals and signal are measured at an intermediate gain (27.5 M\(\Omega\)) on all PMTs (the small source signal, adding to the response of PMTs 3 and 4, is easily subtracted).

#### Comparison of Gain Monitor measurements with QC6 module measurements.

To get a first indication of the variation in time of the module signals, the following analysis was performed:* For each cell of each module, an average QC6 signal is calculated.
* The ratio of this average to the Gain Monitor signal for that cell is taken.
* Finally, for each module the average of these ratios is taken, and is plotted in figure 8.15 for modules IFA013 to IFA017.

It is seen that the average ratios, module by module, are reasonably stable from module IFA013 to module IFA017, corresponding to about two months of module assembly. However, the distribution of individual ratios has substantial tails, whose origin must be investigated.

Note that the results in figure 8.15 are independent of any gain variations of the PMTs from module to module (as long as the PMT gain is stable between QC and gain monitor runs).

#### Source response: a puzzle.

The source measurements should in principle provide a monitor of the evolution of the PMT gains in time - directly for PMTs 3 and 4, that see the source signal in a scintillator, and less directly for the other channels, by correlating with the LED response measured in PMT 3, 4 and all the other PMTs.

Figure 8.15: Module cells response to Gain Monitor ratio for all the instrumented modules analyzed. Dashed lines mark a \(\pm\)10% variation.

Here the first results indicate a progressive loss of signal from PMTs 3 and 4 that is hard to interpret. We suspect mechanical damage in the fiber connectors to these PMTs because the LED signals in these PMTs also appear to progressively decrease, with some correlation to the source signals. If this is the case, repairs are needed in order to calculate and factor out the PMT gains from the measurements, as was planned originally.

### 8.6 Conclusions.

The procedure to test the optical quality of the constructed modules is now firmly established. It has varied very little after the tests of the first few modules.

The quality of the measurements is summarized by the repeatability of the "drop" variable, that is of \((0.6\pm 0.2)\%\). We classify optical faults into three categories: fiber-coupling faults, fiber damage and tile faults. Every fault found in a module was investigated and almost all were understood. Currently, a good understanding of the faults that can appear on a module and which is the action to be done to fix the fault are available. This knowledge has allowed to reduce the "drop" threshold for action from 30% to 25%. In most of the cases, the faults are corrected, which means bringing all drops to a value below 25%.

It is also encouraging that the optical quality of modules has improved as instrumentation proceeded. The spread of ITRs over a module have become stable since the fifth constructed module, which indicates that the instrumentation process is under control and it is now stable. Repairing the optical faults, special care to achieve sampling uniformities within safe _rms_ limits has been taken. These limits were set based on physics performance of the calorimeter with MonteCarlo simulations of pions and muons. The instrumented modules have been shown to be within the criteria imposed by these studies.

The preliminary conclusions from the Gain Monitor LED signals over 5 modules is that no overall dramatic change in module optical properties have been detected. However a number of large variations from individual cells is seen, and must be understood. It has not been possible yet to monitor the gains of the PMTs of the QC drawer.

## Chapter 9 Further studies of module uniformity and tile light yield.

A potential module production problem was reported at the beginning of April 2000 by the ANL group [39]. The problem was related to the scintillator light yield: when the ANL004 module was scanned with the \(Cs^{137}\) source, abnormal tile light output was observed for groups of 20 tiles within a TileRow. As tiles are delivered from the production site (IHEP Protvino) and installed in packs of 20, this observation suggested that juxtaposing packs of tiles with different light yields could constitute a serious source of response variation within cells. At that time, a few cells with these problems had already been found at CERN and IFAE (see figure 9.1 for an example). However, for the ANL004 Extended Barrel module, the light output differences were large enough that a warning had to be placed on production. To deal with this problem a discussion was initiated [40] to improve the uniformity of the instrumented modules.

As a first step for learning more about the source of the problem, it was decided that the optical quality of a module instrumented at IFAE should be tested at CERN with the \(Cs^{137}\) radioactive source. In this chapter the results of scanning the module IFA002 at CERN with the \(Cs^{137}\) source are reported and compared with the previous results of the blue LED scan. Also shown are the results of tile optical properties studies, which where carried out at IFAE. These studies were made to find an estimator for the light yield of the tiles. On the basis of these results, a decision was made1 on an improved method to reduce the variation of tile light yield within cells. This method is also described.

Footnote 1: ATLAS Week in Dubna, June of 2000.

### 9.1 Scanning a module with the \(Cs^{137}\) radioactive source.

The \(Cs^{137}\) test of module IFA002 was principally to see whether the response uniformity of IFAE modules was acceptable, considering that variations in the light output of the batch of tiles delivered to IFAE might have gone unnoticed with the LED-based test set-up.

#### The source system.

In the optical quality control tests at CERN, an hydraulic system is used to drive the \(Cs^{137}\) source trough the calibration tubes. The source calibration tubes are filled with distilled water which is set in motion with a pump. A capsule containing an \(8\,m\,Ci\)\(Cs^{137}\) source is placed in the water. The capsule has a diameter slightly smaller than the tube aperture. The flow passing through the capsule is negligible and its velocity is practically the same as that of the liquid. (This setup is a prototype for the system that will be used in ATLAS, see section 5.2.3).

Eleven tubes (one per TileRow) are connected together, with bent tube sections, to form a single circuit which traverses all of the calorimeter tiles (see figure 9.2). The two ends of the circuit are connected to the liquid drive unit by flexible tubes. The drive unit is located in the control room and consists of a gear pump, pressure and temperature sensors, electromechanical valves and a reservoir. The system is remotely controlled. The source capsule is kept in a \(Pb\) garage outside the test room. A remotely controlled mechanism

inserts the source into the moving liquid column. At the end of its path through the calorimeter, the source comes to rest against a mechanical stop. The direction of the liquid flow is then inverted, and the source returns to its starting place.

#### Single tile response evaluation.

Due to the \(Cs^{137}\) photons mean free path in iron, when the source is scanning a TileRow some radiation can reach the nearest TileRow and produce scintillation light there [42]. Therefore, the raw data from Cesium scans of a typical TileRow mix the responses of two TileRows. Using Barrel Module0 '98 \(Cs^{137}\) data, a study was done to estimate the fraction of the signal which goes to the nearest TileRow [18]. This is referred to as "leakage" signal. Since TileCal modules are divided into three longitudinal samplings for the readout, pure "leakage" signals can be obtained in some TileRows from the source data and this fraction of the signal can be estimated. It was observed that when the source traverses the outer hole of the tiles, 78% of its energy is deposited in the row. Approximately 20.5% of the total energy is collected by the row of tiles located radially outwards from the row being tested (and 1.5% of the source energy is deposited in one row at smaller radius). The observed _rms_ deviations of the leakage signals were of \(\sim\) 0.4%.

Also, when the source is scanning a TileRow, several tiles in that TileRow scintillate as

Figure 9.2: Radioactive source path scheme for an Extended Barrel module.

the source is positioned in a specific tile. In order to extract the individual tile responses a data fitting procedure has been developed2[41]. To estimate the individual tile response, the response of the \(i\)th peak in a TileRow within a cell is approximated to be the sum of a Gaussian and a symmetric exponential contribution,

Footnote 2: The procedure described here was developed by E. Startchenko and A. Karioukhine of IHEP-Protynio.

\[\mathcal{F}_{i}\ (\mathtt{x})=A_{i}\cdot(\mathcal{G}\cdot e^{-0.5\cdot(\frac{x-x_{i}}{ \pi})^{2}}+(1-\mathcal{G})\cdot e^{\frac{-|x-x_{i}|}{\lambda}})\]

where \(\mathcal{G}\) indicates the fraction of the Gaussian and \((1\cdot\mathcal{G})\) the fraction of the exponential contribution.

As already said, when the radiation "leakage" goes to a different calorimeter sampling (so that the "leakage" signal can be cleanly separated), the \(Cs\)[137] readout corresponds to \(78\,\%\) of the source signal deposited in this TileRow. More than three hundred of these cases were fitted to obtain the parameters \(\mathcal{G}_{78}\),\(\sigma_{78}\) and \(\lambda_{78}\), which are listed on table 9.1. The same exercise was done for the cases with \(20.5\%\) "leakage". The fit was performed under exactly the same conditions as for the \(78\,\%\) cases. Over a hundred cases were fitted and the values of the parameters obtained (\(\mathcal{G}_{20.5}\),\(\sigma_{20.5}\) and \(\lambda_{20.5}\)) are also listed on table 9.1. These are the fit parameters used to perform the multi-tile fits of the raw \(Cs\)[137] data.

For a given cell, first the outer tube data which correspond to a pure \(78\%\) case are fitted. The parameters are fixed to values \(\mathcal{G}_{78}\),\(\sigma_{78}\) and \(\lambda_{78}\), shown above. The only variables of the fit are the peak positions and amplitudes for all tile responses: \(\{A_{i}^{\mathit{Outer\ tube}},\)\(x_{i}^{\mathit{Outer\ tube}}\}\). The fitting error for the amplitudes in this case is approximately \(1\%\). After this, the neighboring TileRow source data are ready to be fitted. To approximate from this TileRow the energy "leakage", the data structure of the nearest row, which has been already fitted, is scaled down by the factor \(0.205/0.78\) and is reproduced using the peak amplitudes and positions \(\{A_{i}^{\mathit{Outer\ tube}},\)\(x_{i}^{\mathit{Outer\ tube}}\}\) and the set

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{**Fitted parameters**} \\ \hline \hline _Pure_\(78\,\%\) _case_ & _leakage_\(20.5\%\) _case_ \\ \hline \hline \(\mathcal{G}_{78}\) = \(0.52\pm 0.02\) & \(\mathcal{G}_{20.5}\) = \(0.14\pm 0.10\) \\ \hline \(\sigma_{78}\) = \(4.82\pm 0.14\) _mm_ & \(\sigma_{20.5}\) = \(3.43\pm 1.39\) _mm_ \\ \hline \(\lambda_{78}\) = \(21.60\pm 0.46\) _mm_ & \(\lambda_{20.5}\) = \(24.81\pm 1.42\) _mm_ \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

of parameters associated with the "leakage" structures: \({\cal G}_{20.5}\), \(\sigma_{20.5}\) and \(\lambda_{20.5}\). After subtracting this approximation to the "leakage", the resulting distribution can be fitted as a pure case, using \({\cal G}_{78}\),\(\sigma_{78}\) and \(\lambda_{78}\), and the \(\{A_{i}^{Outer\ tube-1},\)\(x_{i}^{Outer\ tube-1}\}\) values can be obtained. The fitting errors on the amplitudes are approximately 3% in this case. A case where the "leakage" signal is subtracted from the raw \(Cs^{137}\) signal is shown in figure 9.3.

#### Comparison between the \(Cs^{137}\) source scan and the LED scan for mo dule IFA002.

For module IFA002, we measured the response of each individual tile by using the \(Cs^{137}\) source at CERN and the blue LED at IFAE. Few cases of tile light output deviation were observed, specially in TileRow 2. In general, these "light output steps" inside a cell were not observed at IFAE during the blue LED scan. Figure 9.4 displays a typical case. In this plot, the fitted peak amplitudes obtained from the unfolded \(Cs^{137}\) data are plotted together with the individual tile responses obtained from the blue LED scan. In both cases, the data values have been normalized to the mean value of these group of tiles. In both left and right PMTs, groups of tiles with different light yield are observed. The "steps" in response were observed coinciding with the boundaries between packs of 20 tiles.

Figure 9.3: The true \(Cs^{137}\) signal obtained after the imitated “leakage” signal has been subtracted from the raw data. The fitted peak amplitudes are also plotted.

These light yield "steps" confirm that the problem was related to the scintillation processes in the tiles. Moreover, another module (IFA008) was scanned at IFAE with both a blue and an UV LED (NICHIA type NSHU-590E [19], with maximum emission at 370 \(\it{nm}\)), which excites the POPOP component of the scintillator. The correlation found between the ITRs seen by both sources of light was good, with an error of 1.5%. This result indicates that the problem with the light yield of the scintillators could reside at the PTP scintillation molecules level.

Even though the LED does not flag the tile light yield problems, it is very interesting to study how well \(Cs^{13}\)[7] and LED data are correlated. To compare the individual tile responses for the two sources we took the ratio of the two data sets, normalizing all of them to the mean value of all ITRs in a cell within a TileRow. For module IFA002, the \(\it{rms}\) dispersion of the ratio distribution was about 8% (Figure 9.5).

Note that \(\sim 9\%\) (\(\sim 12\%\)) correlation was found during the previous checks of light source for quality control with module prototypes, where another \(Cs^{137}\) unfolding method was applied [18] ([44]). No scintillator problems were observed at that time.

Figure 9.5: Correlation of the ITRs measured by LED and \(Cs^{13}\)[7] for module IFA002.

We observed at least one case where the LED tests spot changes in response associated to scintillators. The case is shown in figure 9.6, where both the \(Cs^{137}\) and the LED scans detected a group of tiles with low response with respect to the others. Due to the fact that the blue LED does not induce scintillation processes in tiles, the problem observed here is probably related to a group of tiles with lower light transmission than the other packs used in the cell.

The \(Cs^{137}\) scan revealed worse module uniformity than the blue LED scan. This is due to the scintillation fluctuations themselves and the fact that the tile packs within a cell are very different, from tile optical properties point of view. Figure 9.7 shows the entire tile-fiber couplings uniformity for the IFA002 module, as seen by the \(Cs^{137}\) source and the blue LED. On these uniformity plots it is observed that the \(Cs^{137}\)\(rms\) is of 8.9%, which is significantly greater than the LED \(rms\), which is of 6.8%.

The \(Cs^{137}\)\(rms\) also contains contributions from some optical faults that appeared after the transportation of the module to CERN. In table 9.3 the faults flagged by the \(Cs^{137}\) and LED are listed (to facilitate future repairs, these faults were marked on the module itself).

Figure 9.7: Uniformity distributions for all normalized ITRs of module IFA002, for both the \(Cs^{137}\) and LED scans.

The Gaussian part of the module uniformity distribution has been fitted to obtain the standard deviation for the \(Cs^{137}\) and LED data. Also, fits for the different samples have been performed. The results are given in table 9.2. An increase of about 2% in the \(rms\) is observed for samplings A and C, while for sample B the increase is \(\sim 1.5\%\).

Also, a comparison has been made between the TileRow responses seen by the \(Cs^{137}\) radioactive source and those observed by the blue LED. To evaluate the TileRow responses, each TileRow response within a cell is normalized to the whole cell response in order to cancel the PMT gain dependences. The longitudinal profile for the LED and the \(Cs^{137}\) is shown in figure 9.8. In order to analyze the difference between the LED and the Cs data, we compared the distribution of ratios of the Tilerow responses determined with the \(Cs^{137}\) and LED data. The \(rms\) of the ratio is 4.4%. However this number tells us only a small part of the "story". In figure 9.8, the response given for each TileRow is the mean of the responses \(\mu_{i}\) for each cell sector \(i\) within a TileRow (counting both sides, even and odd PMTs). The vertical error bar is not the error of the mean of each response, but the \(rms\) spread of the \(\mu_{i}\). It can be seen that for TileRows 2 and 10 the spread is very large in the \(Cs^{137}\) data. This is a strong indication of variation of tile light output, not seen with the LED source. Even though over a whole module this spread is considered tolerable, this is one of the observations that led the TileCal collaborators to further studies a subsequent changes in the sorting of tiles.

### 9.2 Tile light yield parameters and estimators.

The scintillators, produced in a factory near Protvino under IHEP supervision, are grouped in packs of 20 tiles. Before sending the tiles to the instrumentation sites, two properties are measured for one tile out of every pack [43] using a \(\beta\) source: the light yield and the transmission of the tiles. A fiber is attached to one side of the last tile of the pack and it is routed to a PMT; the PMT current, proportional to the light yield, is read-out. Figure 9.9 illustrates how the measurements are taken: the light yield (\(I_{0}\) ) from the tile is measured by putting a radioactive source at the center of the tile and near the fiber. By measuring the light yield when the source is on the other edge (\(I_{1}\)), the transmission (\(I_{0}/I_{1}\)) of the tile can be estimated. A reference tile, one for each tile size, is used to normalize all the measurements in order to cancel the PMT gain variations in time. The packs are subjected to an acceptance cut, which is set to \(\pm 8\%\) for \(I_{0}\) and \(\pm 10\%\) for \(I_{0}/I_{1}\), taken with respect to reference measurements. Tile packs which are outside this "acceptance corridor" are rejected. Finally, these measured tile property parameters are introduced into a database, which is used thereafter for further studies.

The tile packs are sent to the instrumentation sites in boxes (each containing from 6 to 18 packs, depending on tile sizes). To find out why it was possible to have tiles within a cell having very different light yield, we proceeded to examine the \(I_{0}\) and \(I_{0}/I_{1}\) distributions. We observed that the \(rms\) of the distributions for the entire production batch received, for any specific tile size, were typically comparable to the \(rms\) of the tiles in a box (\(\sim 5\%\)). During the instrumentation, the tile boxes were opened in sequence:

Figure 9.9: Protvino setup to measure the tiles light yield properties: \(I_{0}\) and \(I_{0}/I_{1}\).

when a box was empty, another one was opened to continue instrumenting modules. Therefore, it is plausible that in extreme cases (i.e, those cases which correspond to both extremes of the distributions), tiles put in sequence in a cell could show differences of up to 15-20%, for the \(I_{0}\) and/or \(I_{0}/I_{1}\) parameters.

Once the problem was understood, the issue of defining an estimator of the tile light yield, based on \(I_{0}\) and \(I_{0}/I_{1}\), became topical. Several estimators were considered in order to reduce the parameters needed to describe the tile optical properties to just one:

* \(I_{0}\)**:** This parameter indicates the light yield of the tile measured at one side of the tile. It does not take into account the light absorption occurring while the light propagates inside the tile. However, \(I_{0}\) often represents most of the observed effects.
* \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\)**:** It can be simply shown that the light seen from the center of the tile (using the \(Cs^{13\,7}\) source) is proportional to \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\). This approximation does not take into account the light reflections at the end far from a fiber and assumes that light is absorbed exponentially during its propagation inside the tile.
* **(\(I_{0}+2\cdot I_{1}\))**:** This estimator was introduced by Protvino group [43]. It can be shown that this expression is to a good approximation equivalent to expanding \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\) at first order, for \(I_{0}/I_{1}\) values around 2.

#### 9.2.1 Tile light yield measurements at IFAE, using a \(Sr^{90}\) radioactive source.

An attempt to compare the predictive power of the estimators listed above, using a simple setup [45] to simulate \(Cs^{13\,7}\) calibration scans usually conducted at CERN, was done at IFAE in May 2000. The tile under test was placed in a light-tight black box. A \(Sr^{90}\) beta source was positioned at the center of the tile with an estimated accuracy of \(\pm 2\)\(mm\). Two optical fibers at the edges of the tile collected the light produced in the scintillator and channeled it to a single PMT. Reproducible optical contact between the fibers and the tile was insured. An electronic circuit integrated the current at the anode of the PMT and provided a DC voltage which was measured by a digital voltmeter (see figure 9.10).

Two reference tiles were used to evaluate the experimental error. Repeatability measurements were performed as follows. The tile was placed in the box, the fibers were attached to the tile, the source was placed and voltage measurements were taken. Then, the fibers were removed from the tile. We repeated this sequence 10 times; the measured \(rms\) of the response on the reference tiles of size 11 and 1 to be 0.6% and 0.7%, respectively. Three sources of experimental uncertainties were identified: drifts in HV applied to the PMT, repeatability of the fiber-tile coupling and repeatability of the radioactive source positioning over the tile.

18 tile packs of sizes 1,6,10 and 11 were used to compare the predictive power of the estimators. The packs were selected to include extreme cases of the variables \(I_{0}\) and \(I_{0}/I_{1}\), in order to be more sensitive to the signal variations when comparing the estimators [46]. The signals measured for the last tile from the packs of one size were normalized to the mean value. The estimator values were normalized in the same way. The \(\chi^{2}\) was calculated by assuming a 2% uncertainty on the value of \(I_{0}\), as indicated by measurements at CERN3. Similarly, a 2% error was attributed to the \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\) and \((I_{0}+2\cdot I_{1})\) estimators. The resulting \(CL(\%)s\) are shown in table 9.4. As a complement to the \(CL\)s study and in order to get a semi-quantitative understanding of the agreement or disagreement of measurements and estimators, we analyzed the distribution of ratios measurement/estimator, for all tile sizes studied taken together. The _rms_ of the ratios are also listed in table 9.4. Results show that either \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\) or \(I_{0}+2\cdot I_{1}\) estimators can predict the tile light yield.

Footnote 3: M. Cobal, private communication

A separate issue was investigated with the IFAE setup. During about of 20% of the first batch of tile production, the dopants were not uniformly mixed during tile extrusion. Due

Figure 9.10: The IFAE setup to measure the tiles central light yield properties in order to find the best estimator.

to this fact, the \(I_{0}\) parameter of the tiles contained in a certain pack changed significantly within one pack4, by perhaps 10%. The Protvino group suggested to reject 5% of tile packs delivered to the labs because of that. Therefore, we conducted a check of the uniformity of the tile optical properties within a given pack. The packs were selected to represent the best and the worst packs available at that moment (the worst packs were those flagged for rejection by the Protvino group and they correspond to TileRow 11). Signals from 5 tiles (1,6,11,16,20) per pack for 7 packs were used to calculate _rms_ within the pack. The resulting voltage measurements _rms_'s (as percentages) are given in table 9.5. Packs flagged to be rejected, as Protvino suggested, had worse uniformity of the tile

light yield within a pack. However the difference of uniformity within packs is not large, and the statistics of this study is small.

### 9.3 Decisions adopted to reduce light yield variations within cells.

At IFAE, the following approach to scintillator insertion was applied to modules IFA011 to IFA016. We opened up all of the tile boxes and re-ordered all tile packs in ascending order with respect to the \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\) estimator. By ordering the tiles in this manner, we found that steps within a cell were rarely greater than 3%; we thus avoided the problem of having extreme differences of tiles light yield within a cell (e.g. steps up to \(\sim\) 15-20%). The scintillators were inserted into the modules following this methodology.

Before module instrumentation took place at CERN, the tiles were divided into two populations, based on the \(I_{0}\) parameter. This ensured at least a factor of 2 reduction in the in the step differences. An analogous method was also used at the ANL site.

Finally, for the second batch (sizes 1,2,3) and the third batch (from sizes 4 to 11) of tiles, it was agreed to use the following method at all instrumentation sites 5. Having decided that the \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\) variable as the most reliable estimator of the packs optical properties, all the packs of a given size in the batch were re-arranged in descending order

Figure 9.11: Packs ordered in descending order based on the \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\) estimator for tile size 2. Site divisions are also shown.

of \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\) and the resulting distribution was divided in three populations. The one for the Barrel has the higher values of \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\). The second and third populations were assigned to IFAE and ANL Extended Barrels, respectively 6 (see figure 9.11). All the tiles were distributed at CERN following this criteria and then sent to their respective instrumentation sites. By making these tiles divisions, for a given tile size, the maximum variation in light yield between the two most extreme packs is \(\sim\)8-10% for CERN, \(\sim\)2-4% for IFAE and \(\sim\)6-9% for ANL. In table 9.6, the light yield difference for the two most extreme packs, for all tile sizes and sites is shown.

Footnote 6: A curiosity: the choice between the IFAE and ANL batches was made by P. Jenni tossing a coin.

Within each site, tile packs will be inserted into modules as they come. This avoids the time-consuming pack choice process used for IFAE modules IFA011 to IFA016. Note that IFAE received the central part of the distribution, which contains smaller variations than those for the other sites.

### 9.4 Conclusions.

The scan of module IFA002 with the \(Cs\)[13]7 radioactive source at CERN showed that differences in light yield from pack to pack did indeed produce significant differences in response within a cell. Over a whole module, these variations are acceptable; however the result triggered two actions:

## Chapter 10 Summary and conclusions.

The main thrusts of this work are the procedure to test and the results of tests of the Tile Cal Extended Barrel modules assembled at IFAE.

The quality control system has been demonstrated to be reliable enough to test the optical quality of the constructed calorimeter modules: the repeatability of the "drop" variable, used to look for optical troubles, is of \((0.6\pm 0.2)\%\). The blue LED scans spot all the assembly faults which can affect the future performance of the instrumented modules. As shown, correlating optical faults often allows to understand the origin of the pathologies. The faults can be divided in three categories: bad tile-fiber couplings, damaged fibers and poor tiles quality. Every fault found in a module was investigated and corrected if possible. All of these are listed and presently we have a good understanding of the faults that can appear on a module and which is the action needed to fix the fault. This knowledge has also allowed us to reduce the threshold to investigate and repair any optical faults from 30% to 25%. In most of the cases, the faults are corrected, thus bringing the drop under 25%, for more than 3000 individual responses in a module scan.

It is encouraging to notice that the optical quality of the modules has improved during the instrumentation: the number of faults per module decreased with time and experience with the instrumentation process (this is seen at all instrumentation sites). The whole module uniformity distribution for modules constructed at IFAE always has \(rms<10\%\), as required not to deteriorate the calorimeter resolution constant term. When repairing the optical faults, special care to achieve sampling uniformities within safe limits has been taken. These limits are based on simulations of the resolution of the calorimeter for isolated pions, and on the requirement of good detection efficiency in the 3rd sampling for muons. In all cases, the instrumented modules are within the criteria imposed by these studies.

The last chapter of this document is devoted to the investigations that followed the observation of large differences in tile response at ANL. A scan of the module IFA002 with the \(Cs^{13\,7}\) radioactive source revealed "response steps" (not as large as those suggested by the ANL) in certain cells, specially those in TileRow 2, that had not been observed by the blue LED scan. These steps are consistent with the correlation (\(\sim\)8%) between LED and \(Cs^{13\,7}\) scanning methods. Looking at the main tile light yield properties measured at Protvino (i.e. \(I_{0}\) and \(I_{0}/I_{1}\)) it was realized that packs corresponding to the extreme sides of these distributions placed in a cell could produce differences of up to 15-20%. Thus it became desirable to sort tiles into subsets that would reduce these differences within cells. For this purpose, a light yield estimator had to be defined and experimentally checked. A simple experiment to compare the predictive power of several estimators was performed at IFAE. The results showed that the parameters \(\sqrt{I_{0}\cdot I_{1}}\) and \((I_{0}+2\cdot I_{1})\) are reliable estimators of the light yield produced by the tiles. Based on these results, the latest batches of tiles (June 2000, about \(\frac{1}{2}\) of the total needed) was divided into subsets with separate and smaller ranges of light yield. Each subset will be used at each instrumentation site. This is expected to reduce the variation of response within cells and thus avoid significant local non-uniformities.

## Appendix A The QC6 shifter's manual.

This Appendix is meant to serve as an archive of the manual used by data-takers who perform the optical quality control of the Extended Barrel modules constructed at IFAE.

After a calorimeter module has been fully instrumented, technicians place the movable dark room enclosing the module, fix the Extender at the module front plate and put the plastic tubes into the source calibration holes. The shifter tasks to QC'ed a module are described below.

### A.1 Preparation of the module.

1. **Putting the drawer into the girder:** the drawer will be stored in the Gain Monitor. Place the Gain Monitor in front of the girder and slide the drawer in (with care).
2. **Cabling the system:** follow the color codes which indicate where the cables have to be connected.
3. **Checking the "Extender" environment**: With the PLC front panel keyboard, check that the "Extender" stops properly at each TileRow. If a TileRow is missed, check the "Extender" sensors with the help of a technician. Check also that the diffuser enters and exits at each TileRow with no difficulty: the plastic tubes have to be well fixed at the module front plate.
4. **Light leaks?:** Check for any light leak inside the Dark Room. They must be eliminated to avoid overexposure of PMTs to light.
5. **Test run:** Make a test run for TileRow 1 to check the communication with the PC (_ifa e-w19_). The steps to be followed are:* Close the Dark Room and turn lights off. Block the door with the sign: "STOP: HV ON".
* Set the HV to 750 V. Also switch the LV PS on.
* Open _c:/qbench/qbench.exe._ Load _module6.hv_ values and send them the HV controller.
* Open the main DAQ program which stands at _e:/main_qc_program/daq_program.vi_ (see figure A.2). Launch it and follow the instructions. The parameters to be entered are shown in figure A.1.

Figure A.2: Location of the main QC programs on the _ifae-w19_ hard disk.

## Appendix A.2 Check of the laser fibers.

1. Cable the "plastic diffuser" in the Extender blue diffuser connector. Insert it into one of the two laser bundle connectors.
2. Close the Dark Room and turn lights off. Block the door with the sign: "STOP: HV ON".
3. Set the HV to 750 V. Also switch the LV PS on.
4. Open _c:/qbench/qbench.exe._ Load _module6.hv_ values and send them the HV controller.
5. Open the main Gain Monitor program which stands at _e:/main_qc_program/gm_program.vi._ Launch it and follow the instructions. The parameters to be entered are shown in figure A.3. Take a measurement with the HV on, LED V off (pedestals) and another with the HV on, LED V on (signal).
6. Turn HV off, go inside the Dark room and re-position the diffuser on the opposite side laser connector of the module.
7. Repeat the steps from item 2, but take only a signal run (the pedestal have been taken previously).
8. Compare left and right laser signals with pedestals: do you see the signal in all 28 channels? Good.
9. Un-cable the "plastic diffuser" and connect the "Extender" blue diffuser cable in the LV connector.

### A.3 First scan of the module.

1. Tape the last three profiles of the C10 cell.
2. Close the Dark Room and turn lights off. Block the door with the sign: "STOP: HV ON".
3. Set the HV to 750 V. Also switch the LV PS on.
4. Open _c:/qbench/qbench.exe._ Load _module6.hv_ values and send them the HV controller.

5. Open the main DAQ program which stands at _e:/main_qc_program/daq_program.vi_. Launch it and follow the instructions. The main parameters to be entered are shown in figure A.5, but set the electronics warm-up to 0 _min_.
6. Monitor that the HV is not lost with the help of the GUI of the _qbench_ software. If it was lost stop the program, erase the last raw data file, modify the run counter down by 1, restart the _qc_main.vi_ from the TileRow where you had lost the HV. Finally do not forget to modify the log_file (see figure A.4\(\rightarrow\)run_number.dat_ and _log_file.txt_).
7. When the module has been scanned, check the 3-in-1 calibration in the monitor files (figure A.4).
8. Analyze the data (accessible on the local network on _ifa_e-w19_). Generate the trouble file, check the histograms and send the results by e-mail to all QC team (the analyzing software can be found at _ifa_e-c0/users/jflix/qc6_soft/_.

### 0.4 Performing the optical repairs.

With the help of the trouble file, all the problems with thresholds greater than 25 % must be repaired (see section 0.3). After the repairs, the final scan follows.

### Final Scan

1. Check for any light leak inside the Dark Room.
2. Close the Dark Room and turn lights off. Block the door with the sign: "STOP: HV ON".

Finally do not forget to modify the log_file (figure A.4, _run_number.dat_ and _log_file.txt_).
7. When the module has been scanned, check the 3in1 calibration in the monitor files (figure A.4).
8. Analyze the data (accessible on the local network on _ifae-w19_). Generate the trouble file, the trouble GIF images, check the histograms and send the results by e-mail to all QC team (the analyzing software can be found at _ifae-c0/users/jfik/qc6_soft/_).
