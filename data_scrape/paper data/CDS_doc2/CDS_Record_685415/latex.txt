In note [1] a program to calculate the magnetic field of the ATLAS detector was presented. Since that time some changes in the geometry of the detector have been made. In this note the effect of special fingers and moved shielding plate are studied, using the program of [1]. The mesh was adapted for each case. Field maps are presented and results are discussed.

## 1 Special fingers

### Introduction

The special fingers are the 8 fingers passing through the Liquid Argon Calorimeter (LAr) supports, two fingers for each support. These fingers are presented in drawing ATLLBMH 0014, stored in CDD and called "special finger series B2". In this note we will call them "special fingers".

The special fingers differ from the other fingers in that they contain an 8.5 cm long section in the z-direction with less iron. This section has an outer dimension of 21x21 cm [2] an a thickness of 1.5 cm.

To calculate the magnetic field in the special finger region, the model of ATLAS with discrete meshing of spokes was used. This model is described in [1].

The mesh covers only 1/16th of total space, using the symmetry of the detector, and has about 64000 nodes. As the special fingers are situated far away from the z = 0 plane, the same boundary conditions as for the standard model of ATLAS were used.

The model represents 8 modules situated at f from 90 deg. to 45 deg. with toroid coil at f = 78.5 deg. As the LAr supports are at f = -45 deg. and -135 deg, the position of the special fingers will be in the place of right and left standard fingers with the center at f = 47.8125 deg. and at f = 87.1875 deg. That corresponds to a 'worst'case with two special fingers every 45 deg. (in reality every 90 deg.).

The following cases were studied:

-a model with 2 special fingers

-a model with 2 special fingers made from only aluminium on the length of 8.5 cm in

the z-direction

-a model with all the fingers with thickness of 1.5 cm iron on all their length in z direction

All these cases use the same mesh with different list of attributed materials.

### Model

The model of [1] was adapted for the present calculations:

a) refinement of the mesh in the region of the spokes and the fingers

4 subdivisions (instead of one) in the spokes region in the r-direction,

7 subdivisions (instead of 5) in the finger region in the z-direction

New mesh has about 85000 nodes.

b) adaptation of the mesh and materials to the dimensions of the special fingersThe special fingers are represented as standard fingers with thickness of 1.5 cm. This part begins at z = -2.82 m and has a length of 8.5 cm in the z-direction.

Exact modelling of the special fingers will complicate the calculation since non-regular triangular elements must be introduced. Instead it can be represented by a lamination factor of 0.4286=1.5cm/3.5cm in the f-direction (3.5 cm is the thickness of the standard finger). Use of a lamination factor conserves the standard mesh. For details see [1], appendix I.

c) a new fast **iterative** solver (Jacobi conjugate gradient algoritm) was implemented.

The solver used before was based on the **direct** Cholesky method for positive definite band matrices. It was very slow (11.6 hours for a model with 86.000 nodes). The new solver needs only 45 minutes for the same model.

## 1.3 Results

**Fig.1 a)** shows \(|\)B\(|\) in the xy-plane in the finger region at z = -2.86 m with only standard fingers.

In **fig.1 b)** the maximum is set to 0.03 T.

**Fig.2 a)** gives \(|\)B\(|\) in the xy-plane in the finger region at z = -2.86 m with 2 special fingers.

In **fig.2 b)** the maximum is set to 0.03 T.

The asymmetry in B comes from the interference of toroid and solenoid.

**Fig.3 a)** gives \(|\)B\(|\) in the xy-plane in the finger region at z = -2.86 m with 2 special 'aluminium' fingers (fingers made from only aluminium on the length of 8.5 cm in the z-direction).

In **fig.3 b)** the maximum is set to 0.03 T.

**Fig.4** gives the comparison between above 3 cases with \(|\)B\(|\) as function of z at radius  r = 4.035 m (center of the fingers) and at radius  r = 4.11 m (bottom of the fingers).

The case with all standard fingers is represented with a solid red line, the case with 2 special fingers with a dashed dark blue line, the case with 2 special 'aluminium' fingers with a solid blue line.

**Fig.4 a,c)** shows the field inside the special finger at  f = 47.8125 deg. (lateral center) for r = 4.035 m and r = 4.11 m.

**Fig.4 b,d)** shows the field at the lateral center of a normal finger at f = 59.0625 deg. (the 6th finger counted from the OY-axis) for r = 4.035 m and r = 4.11 m.

The field in the center of the special finger is about 2 times higher than in the center of the standard finger, but is still below 50 Gauss.

The influence on the field in the other fingers is very small (+7%).

**Fig.5 a)** gives \(|\)B\(|\) in the xy-plane in the finger region at z = -2.86 m in case all fingers were special.

**In fig.5 b)** the maximum is set to 0.06 T.

The asymmetry in the field comes from the interference of toroid and solenoid.

The maximum of the field in the center of the fingers is in this case 300 Gauss at f = 75.9375 deg. (in the center of the third finger counted from the OY-axis).

## 1.4 Conclusions

The calculated field in the center of the special fingers is below 50 Gauss. Even in the case when all fingers are special, the maximum of the field is only 300 Gauss. It seems possible to install the same electronics in the special fingers as in the standard fingers.

The influence of the special fingers on the magnetic field is small. For the future general model of the ATLAS detector they can be neglected.

## 2 Moved shielding plate

### Introduction

Another change in the geometry of the ATLAS detector, studied in this note, is the position of the shielding plate. This plate will be moved at least 20 cm in the z-direction compared to the old model, creating an air gap between the end of the girder and the shielding plate.

### Model

The mesh of the model from [1] was adapted to the studied case. New mesh has 4 subdivision in the r-direction in the region of the spokes. To establish the amount of subdivisions in the air gap between plate and girder two models with 3 and 6 subdivisions were compared. As one can see in fig.9, the model with 6 subdivisions for the air region gives a good approximation.

### Results

**Fig.6** shows \(|\)B\(|\) in the rz-plane for the model with a 20 cm air gap between the girder and the shielding plane at f = 56.85 deg. This angle was choosen because here the field is maximal. The maximum of the scale is set to 0.5 T.

**Fig.7** gives a closer look to the end of the girder. The maximum is set to 0.5 T.

**Fig.7a)** shows \(|\)B\(|\) in the rz-plane for the model with a 20 cm air gap between the girder and the shielding plane at f = 56.85 deg.

**Fig.7b)** shows \(|\)B\(|\) in the rz-plane for the model without an air gap.

**Fig.8** gives \(|\)B\(|\) in the air gap at z = - 6.675 m. The maximum is set to 0.06 T.

The asymmetry is caused by the return flux of the solenoid.

**Fig.9** gives the comparison between the model with 3 subdivisions for the air gap between the end of the girder and the shielding plate (dashed blue line) and the model with 6 subdivisions (solid blue line). The model without air gap is represented with a dashed red line.

The \(|\)B\(|\)-field is shown as function of z at r = 4.035 m at f = 81.5625 deg.

**Fig.10** gives the comparison in the girder between the model with and without air gap. \(|\)B\(|\) is shown as function of z at r = 4.18 m. The model with the air gap between the girder and the shielding plate is represented with a dashed blue line. The model without it is represented with a solid red line.

**Fig.10 a)** at f = 56.85 deg.; **fig.10 b)** at f = 90 deg.

### Conclusions

The results show that the maximum field in the center of the spoke region at r = 4.035 m is under 160 Gauss. At the bottom of the spokes at r = 4.12m a maximum of \(|\)B\(|\) is found of 450 Gauss, as one can see from fig.8.
