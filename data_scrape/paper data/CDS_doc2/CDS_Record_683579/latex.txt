**Abstract**

This note describe a method to estimate the R5900 PMT's 480 nm quantum efficiency, using only measurements of "white" and "blue" photocathode luminous sensitivity. The method had been first tested on two PMT for which the full spectral characteristics are available. One of these PMT's corresponds to a "typical" R5900, and the other to a non "typical" one in point of view of its characteristics. The method had been then applied to the set of 65 PMT's used in Module 0. Cross check of the 480 nm quantum efficiency estimation are performed using 480 nm DC light photocathode sensitivity already measured for these PMT's previously to their use in Module 0.

**1. R5900 photometric and radiometric**

**characteristics**

When delivering PMT's Hamamatsu used to provide their measurements of some photometric and radiometric characteristics of the supplied PMTs. These characteristics are:

- The "white" photocathode luminous sensitivity (\(\mu\)A/lm).

- The "blue" (Corning CS-58 filtered) photocathode luminous sensitivity (\(\mu\)A/lmb)

- The anode luminous sensitivity in (A/lm).

These characteristics had been measured by Hamamatsu at 800 Volts and using a specific voltage repartition: 1.5:1.5:1.5:1.1:1:0.5. Figure 1 show these characteristics for the whole set of R5900 ordered for the Module 0. Average "white" photocathode luminous sensitivity is of the order of 75 \(\mu\)A/lm, and the "blue" cathode luminous sensitivity is on the average a factor 8.3 smaller. The PMT current amplification is equal to the ratio of the anode luminous sensitivity on the photocathode luminous sensitivity and could be estimated on average to 2.4 10\({}^{6}\) with a maximum amplification equal to 5.5 10\({}^{6}\).

_Figure 1 : Main characteristics of the whole set (65 samples) of R5900 dedicated for Module 0. Data are reported in Tables (1) and (2)._Even if these standard characteristics are useful to select PMT's, they don't give any information about the efficiency of the PMT to convert the light from the fibres, i.e. the quantum efficiency of the PMT at the specific wavelength they should be used in the Tilecal. The main goal of the following is to estimate this quantum efficiency only by the way of the standard characteristics. But one should keep in mind that on a large scale, this measurement should be performed by the PMT test bench using a calibrated light source.

**1.1 The photocathode and anode luminous sensitivity**.

**Luminous sensitivity is a photometric measure**1 used when comparing the sensitivity of photomultiplier tubes categorized in the same types. It is expressed in units of ampere per lumen (A/lm):

Footnote 1: the subscripts \(e,\nu\) designate usualy radiometric and photometric quantities respectively

\[S_{k}(A/lm)\ =\ \frac{I_{k}(A)}{\Phi_{\nu}(lm)} \tag{1}\]

This sensitivity is generaly defined for a specific spectral distribution of the radiation, i.e., a tungsten lamp at a colour temperature of 2856K [1]. The relative spectral irradiance of such a lamp is shown in Figure 2.

By definition, **photometric measurement depends on how the radiation source appears to the human eye**. The response of the "standard" light adapted human eye (photocopic vision) is denoted by the normalized function \(V(\lambda)\). This function is called the photocopic luminous efficiency [2],[3], and its variation as a function of \(\lambda\) is also shown on Figure 2. Finally the variation of the eye response with wavelength, and the spectrum of the radiation, determine the luminous sensitivity.

Figure 2: Left: relative spectral irradiance from a tungsten lamp operated at a color temperature of 2856 K. Right: photocopic luminous efficiency, \(V(\lambda)\). Data are reported in Tables (3) and (4).

PMT's are tested by manufacturers using a calibrated lamp with brightness of some Candela (cd). Candela is a unit taking into account of human eye's response, and lumen is defined as following: the illumination intensity on a surface one meter away from a point light source of one Candela, is one Lux, and one lumen equals the luminous flux of one lux passing through an area of one square meter.

Hamamatsu measures photocathode (anode) luminous sensitivity using a luminous flux of around \(10^{-4}\)_lm_ (\(10^{-8}\)_lm_) on the PMT photocathode. We can so calculate the PMT current amplification by the way of the ratio of the anode luminous sensitivity to the photocathode luminous sensitivity.

However it should be noted that lumen is the unit of luminous flux with respect to the standard human's visual sensitivity, and by the way it has no physical significance for most of the PMT's applications.

That is why it would be better to use a radiometric measure of the device sensitivity as the radiant sensitivity, defined as the photoelectric current from the photocathode divided by the incident radiant flux (expressed in ampere per watts).

\[S_{k}(A/W)\ =\ \frac{I_{k}(A)}{\Phi_{e}(W)} \tag{2}\]

Conversion from a radiometric quantity (in watts) to the corresponding photometric quantity (in lumens) simply requires multiplying the spectral radiant distribution curve by the photocopic response curve, integrating the product curve and multiplying the results by a conversion factor of 683. So for a photometric quantity (_PQ_) and its matching radiometric quantity (_SPQ_), one has the following relation:

\[PQ\ =\ 683\int(SPQ)_{\lambda}\ V(\lambda)\ d\lambda \tag{3}\]

In most of the application with photomultipliers, one used a specific radiation. That is why one often define a spectral response characteristic which is a display of the response of a photosensitive device as a function of the wavelength of the exciting radiation. So, if \(d\Phi_{e}\) is the incident radiant flux in a range \(d\lambda\) around a specific wavelength \(\lambda\), and \(dI_{k}\) is the corresponding photocathode current, the following expression:

\[S_{k,\lambda}(A/W)\ =\ \lim_{d\lambda\to 0}\left[\frac{dI_{k}(A)}{d\Phi_{e}(W)} \right]_{\lambda} \tag{4}\]

defines the monochromatic radiant sensitivity or spectral radiant sensitivity. Such characteristics may be on an absolute or a relative basis. Relative spectral response characteristics is the ratio of \(S_{k,\lambda}\) on the radiant sensitivity at some specific wavelength \(S_{m}\). Usually \(S_{m}\) is choozen equal to the maximum of \(S_{k,\lambda}\), so that the curves are usually normalized to unity at the peak of the spectral response curve.

The ratio of the number of emitted photoelectrons to the number of incident photons is the quantum efficiency \(\eta\).

The quantum efficiency is related to the spectral radiant sensitivity by the following expression,

\[S_{k,\lambda}\ \ =\ \ \frac{\eta e}{hc/\lambda}=\ \frac{\eta e\lambda}{hc} \tag{5}\]

in units of amperes per watt, where \(e\) is the charge of the electron. Solving for the quantum efficiency

\[\eta\ =\ \frac{hc}{e}\times\frac{S_{k,\lambda}}{\lambda}\ =\ 124\,\times\frac{S_{k, \lambda}}{\lambda} \tag{6}\]

where \(\lambda\) is given in nanometers, \(S_{k,\lambda}\) is given in milliamperes per watt, and \(\eta\) is given in per cent.

Let the relative radiant sensitivity of a typical R5900 photocathode be represented by \(R(\lambda)\), and designate the absolute radiant response at the peak of the response curve by \(\sigma\). The complete radiant response characteristics is given by the function:

\[lim_{d\lambda\to 0}\left[\frac{dI_{k}(A)}{d\Phi_{e}(W)}\right]_{\lambda}\ =\ \ S_{k,\lambda}(A/W)\ =\ \ \sigma R(\lambda) \tag{7}\]

Figure 3 shows the typical relative spectral radiant sensitivity of the R5900 PMT's.

Figure 3: Typical Relative radiant spectral sensitivity (\(R(\lambda)\) of a R5900 PMT’s. \(S_{k,\lambda}\) is equal to \(\sigma R(\lambda)\) with \(\sigma\) is the absolute radiant response at the peak of the response curve. Data are reported in Table (5).

The spectral distribution of the lamp radiation striking the photocathode be given by \(W(\lambda)\). The average power radiated from the light source, and seen by the photocathode, may be expressed as follows,

\[\Phi_{e}(W)=\int W(\lambda)d\lambda\ =\ P_{0}\int W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda \tag{8}\]

where \(W^{\prime}(\lambda)\) is normalized to unity at the peak of the spectral radiation characteristics, and \(P_{0}\) is some constant (in watts).

The response of the photocathode (in amperes) to the radiation is then given by:

\[I_{k}(A)\ =\ \sigma\int R(\lambda)W(\lambda)d\lambda\ =\ \sigma R_{0}\int R( \lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda \tag{9}\]

The integration is done over the complete range of wavelengths limited either by \(R(\lambda)\) or \(W^{\prime}(\lambda)\). The radiant photocathode sensitivity is,

\[S_{k}(A/W)\ =\ \frac{I_{k}(A)}{\Phi_{e}(W)} \tag{10}\]

subsituting equations (8) and (9) in (10) gives,

\[S_{k}(A/W)\ =\ \frac{\sigma P_{0}\int R(\lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda}{P _{0}\int W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda}\ =\ \frac{\sigma\int R(\lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda}{ \int W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda} \tag{11}\]

note that \(P_{0}\), need not to be known.

The light flux in lumens, \(\Phi_{\nu}\), represented by the total radiant flux, \(\Phi_{e}(W)\), is given by:

\[\Phi_{\nu}\ =\ 683\int V(\lambda)W(\lambda)d\lambda \tag{12}\]

where \(V(\lambda)\) is the spectral luminous efficiency as modelised in Figure 2. The luminous photocathode sensitivity in amperes per lumen is given by the ratio of expressions (9) and (11)

\[S_{k}(A/lm)=\frac{\sigma\int R(\lambda)W(\lambda)d\lambda}{683\int V(\lambda)W (\lambda)d\lambda} \tag{13}\]

from equation (13) the absolute radiant response at the peak, \(\sigma\), may be obtained,

\[\sigma\ =\ \frac{683S_{k}\int V(\lambda)W(\lambda)d\lambda}{\int R(\lambda)W( \lambda)d\lambda}\ =\ \frac{683S_{k}\int V(\lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda}{ \int R(\lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda} \tag{15}\]

note again that absolute magnitude of the function \(W(\lambda)\) need not to be known. If one assume that the shape of the spectral radiant sensitivity is the same for each PMT, one could easily deduces \(\sigma\) as a characteristic of each PMT, using equation (15) and a sampling of \(V(\lambda)\), \(W^{\prime}(\lambda)\) and \(R(\lambda)\).

As a concrete application, Hamamatsu data indicates that for PMT \(\#5D17F4\)\(S_{k}\) is equal to 80 \(\mu\,A/lm\). Using equation (15) in a sampled form, one obtains a estimed value,

\[\sigma=83.54\ m\,A/W\]

where the value from directly measured spectra is,

\[\sigma=80.98\ m\,A/W\]

There is a systematic difference between the estimed value and the measured one which is due to the sampling used for the integrations in the expressions. From some PMT's measured spectra, we calculate that this systematic error is of the order of 3%, and we shall take that systematic into account in the following calculations.

As once one knows the estimed value for \(\sigma\), and using the typical relative radiant spectral sensitivity as shown on Figure 3, one could easily deduce the spectral radiant sensitivity, and finally the quantum efficiency for any wavelength using relation (7).

As an illustration using the typical relative radiant spectral sensitivity of Figure 3 for the PMT \(\#5D17F4\), one estimate the quantum efficiency to be 17.38% at 480 nm instead a direct Hamamatsu directly measured value of 17.35%.

**1.2 The filtered photocathode luminous sensitivity**.

As lumen is the unit of luminous flux with respect to the standard visual sensitivity, it has no physical significance for photomultipliers tubes which have a spectral response range beyond the visible region (350 to 750 nanometers). That is why manufacturers often use "blue sensitivity". This sensitivity is measured with the same standard light source as luminous sensitivity but with a colour filter placed between the source and the photocathode to simulate the emission spectrum of another source, mostly a scintillator. The used filter is a Corning Cs No. 5-58 polished to half stock thickness, which closely simulates the emission spectrum of a NaI(Tl) scintillator (peak wavelength 420 nanometers). The photocathode current corresponding to 1 lumen incident on this filter is so called the photocathode blue sensitivity and is expressed in \(\mu\)A/lmb (b for "blue") or sometimes in \(\mu\)A/lmF (F for "filtered"). From manufacturer's experience, the "blue" and radiant sensitivities are empirically related:

\[\text{radiant sensitivity at 400 nm(mA/W)}\ \sim\ 8.3\ \times\ \text{blue sensitivity ($\mu$A/lmb)} \tag{16}\]

As the input light distribution incident on the detector is modified with the "blue" filter, the spectral distribution of the radiation striking the photocathode gets now \(W^{\prime\prime}(\lambda)\). So the average power, seen by the photocathode, may be expressed as follows,

\[\Phi_{e}(W)=\int W(\lambda)^{\prime\prime}d\lambda\ =\ P_{1}\int W^{\prime \prime\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda \tag{17}\]

where \(W^{\prime\prime\prime}(\lambda)\) is normalized to unity at the peak of the spectral radiation characteristics, and \(P_{1}\) is some constant (in watts). Relative spectral irradiance from a tungsten lamp operated at a color temperature of 2856 K, and transmitted by a "blue" filter is shown in Figure 4.[4]

The response of the photocathode (in amperes) to the radiation is then given by:

\[I_{k}(A)\ =\ \sigma\int R(\lambda)W(\lambda)^{\prime\prime}d\lambda\ =\ \sigma P_{1}\int R(\lambda)W^{\prime\prime\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda \tag{18}\]

The Hamamatsu "blue" photocathode luminous sensitivity corresponds to,

\[S_{kb}(A/lm\,b)\ =\ \frac{I_{k}(A)}{\Phi_{\nu}(lm)}\ =\ \frac{\sigma P_{1}\int R( \lambda)W^{\prime\prime\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda}{683P_{0}\int V(\lambda)W^{ \prime}(\lambda)d\lambda} \tag{19}\]

\(W^{\prime}\) and \(W^{\prime\prime\prime}\) are normalized functions but now \(P_{0}\) and \(P_{1}\) does not cancel as in expression (11). This ratio take into account of the "blue" filter light attenuation. It should be determined first by the way of the ratio of \(S_{k}/S_{kb}\), i.e., the ratio of expression (13) and (19),

\[\frac{S_{k}}{S_{kb}}\ =\ \frac{P_{0}\sigma\int R(\lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d \lambda}{683P_{0}\sigma\int V(\lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda}\times\frac {683P_{0}\sigma\int V(\lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda}{P_{1}\sigma\int R( \lambda)W^{\prime\prime\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda} \tag{20}\]

\[\frac{S_{k}}{S_{k}b}\ =\ \frac{P_{0}\int R(\lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda}{P _{1}\int R(\lambda)W^{\prime\prime\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda} \tag{21}\]

Under the assumption that \(R(\lambda)\) is typical of a set of PMT and that experimental conditions for sensitivities measurements do not change, \(S_{k}/S_{kb}\) should remains constant and allows to estimate the ratio \(P_{0}/P_{1}\).

**1.3 Calculation of light fibre's specific sensitivity**

Extending the notion of specific sensitivity used for the definition of the "blue" luminous sensitivity, one could define a specific sensitivity taking into account of the matching between the PMT photocathode spectral sensitivity and the light emission distribution of the Kuraray fibers. If one assumes that in equation (18), \(W^{\prime\prime\prime}\) could be identify to the spectral distribution of the fibers shown in Figure 5, the following expression is equal to the overall sensitivity of the photocathode to the light emission from the fibers,

\[S_{kura}(A/W)\ =\ \sigma\frac{\int W^{\prime\prime}(\lambda)R(\lambda)d\lambda}{ \int W^{\prime\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda}\ =\ \sigma\frac{\int W^{\prime\prime\prime}(\lambda)R(\lambda)d\lambda}{ \int W^{\prime\prime\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda} \tag{22}\]

The ratio of integrals is only depending of the shape of the curves \(W^{\prime\prime\prime}\) and \(R(\lambda)\). Using the calculated value of \(\sigma\) for PMT \(\#5D17F4\), and spectra of Figures 3 and 5, one obtains,

\[S_{kura}\ =\ 70.77\ m\,A/W\]

## 2 Definition of a subset of typical R5900 PMTs

From now we will use the above described method, together with the data provided by Hamamatsu for the whole set of PMT, to estimate for each PMT, first the 480 nm quantum efficiency and then to determine the light fibre's specific sensitivity.

### Determination of the \(\sigma\) factor

Using expression (15), one first deduce the value of \(\sigma\), assuming, for each PMT, that the relative radiant spectral sensitivity is given by the distribution shown in Figure 4, and that \(V(\lambda)\) and \(W(\lambda)\) is modelled by Figures 2. The distribution of the \(\sigma\) values for the whole set of R5900 is shown in Figure 6. The averaged value of \(\sigma\) is of the order of 76.6 mA/W with a dispersion of 8.5%.

_Figure 6 : Distribution of the estimated \(\sigma\) values for the whole set of R5900._

### Characterisation of the "typical" PMTs

Limitation of such a method could result from the variation of the shape of the relative spectral radiant sensitivity as a function of \(\lambda\) for each PMT. For all the PMTs, we check the assumption that distribution can be modelised by the typical one. This is achieved by the way of the 400 nm quantum efficiency that could be estimated by two independant methods,

\(\bullet\) Using the measured "blue" photocathodes sensitivity and expression (16) to estimate first 400 nm radiant sensitivity. The 400 nm quantum efficiency is then calculated from expression (6).

\(\bullet\) Using \(\sigma\) value and relative spectral radiant sensitivity to estimate first 400 nm radiant sensitivity. Finaly the 400 nm quantum efficiency is calculated from expression (6).

For each PMT, the both methods should give roughly the same value for the 400 nm quantum efficiency, and so a ratio of both estimation equal to 1.

Figure 7 presents this ratio for the whole set of PMTs, we define as "typical", PMT's for which the ratio is between the range \([0.95-1.05]\). That condition defines a subset of 37 of the initial set of 65 samples. For that subset of PMT's the averaged 400 nm (480 nm) quantum efficiency is 23.9 (16.5)%. At 400 nm, the dispersion of the estimed quantum efficiency is \(\sim\) 6.3%.

_Figure 7: Right: Distribution of the ratio of the two independant estimation of the 400 nm quantum efficiency for the whole set of R5900. Left: 400 nm quantum efficiency of the subset of "typical" PMT._

### Determination of the "blue" filter attenuation

Using only the subset of "typical" R5900, one could estimate the ratio \(P_{0}/P_{1}\) from the the ratio \(S_{k}/S_{kb}\),

\[\frac{S_{k}}{S_{kb}}\ =\ \frac{P_{1}\int R(\lambda)W^{\prime\prime\prime}( \lambda)d\lambda}{P_{0}\int R(\lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda} \tag{23}\]

and,

\[\frac{P_{0}}{P_{1}}\ =\ \frac{S_{k}\int R(\lambda)W^{\prime\prime\prime}( \lambda)d\lambda}{S_{kb}\int R(\lambda)W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda} \tag{24}\]

The distribution of the estimed ratio \(P_{0}/P_{1}\) is shown in Figure 8. It spreads over a range of 2 10-3, with an averaged value,

\[\langle\frac{P_{0}}{P_{1}}\rangle\ =\ 0.043 \tag{25}\]

We should keep in mind that this ratio is completely independant of the PMTs and only reflects of the operating conditions (light source and Corning filter)

## 3 Correction from the fluctuation of the shape

of the PMT spectral distribution

As claimed above we should take into account of the variation of the shape of the relative spectral radiant sensitivity for each different PMT. This fluctuation generaly results in a shift of the spectral PMT sensitivity for higher values of the wavelength. Difference below 400 nm does not have any influence on the photocathode luminous sensitivity since phototopic response is equal to 0 in that range. It is not the case for wavelength in the 600 nm range. We simulate the fluctuation, as a global shift of the "typical" relative spectral radiant distribution, i.e.,

\[R(\lambda)\ \longrightarrow R(\lambda-\lambda_{0}) \tag{26}\]

where \(\lambda_{0}\) is the value of the shift. In order to check that corrective method we use a second PMT (#6E06D2) for which the relative spectral radiant distribution (and quantum efficiency) had been fully measured by Hamamatsu.

This PMT has a luminous photocathode sensitivity ("blue" luminous sensitivity) equal to 101 \(\mu\)A/lm (9 \(\mu\)A/lmb). Using the previous method for \(\sigma\) determination, together with the measured \(S_{k}\), and the relative spectral radiant sensitivity, one estimate \(\sigma\) to 102.35 mA/W instead of 77.35 mA/W for the measured value.

Using once more the relative radiant spectral distribution, the 400 (480) nm quantum efficiency is 31.7 (21.9)%, to be compared with the Hamamatsu measured values: 21.8 % for 400 nm and 19.1 % for 480 nm.

Figure 8: Distribution of the estimated P0/P1 ratio from the subset of 37 ”typical” R5900.

Moreover, if one use \(S_{kb}\) together with expression (16) and (5), one estimate that the quantum efficiency at 400 nm is 23.3 %; that is a very different estimation from the previous one (31.7%). So PMT #6E06D2 cannot be defined as a "typical" one.

Introducing the shift in \(R(\lambda)\), \(P_{0}/P_{1}\) gets,

\[\frac{P_{0}}{P_{1}}\ =\ \frac{S_{k}\int R(\lambda-\lambda_{0})W^{\prime\prime \prime}(\lambda)d\lambda}{S_{kb}\int R(\lambda-\lambda_{0})W^{\prime}(\lambda)d\lambda} \tag{27}\]

Now we make \(\lambda_{0}\) take values, with 10 nm steps in the \([-50,50]\) nanometer range. For each step, the new value of the ratio \(P_{0}/P_{1}\) is calculated, and the final value of \(\lambda_{0}\) is the one for which the difference between that new ratio \(P_{0}/P_{1}\) and \(\langle P_{0}/P_{1}\rangle\) (expression (25)) is the minimum.

For PMT #6E06D2, the shift is of the order of 30 nm and Figure 9 presents the comparison between the measured distribution and the approximated one from the 30 nm shifted typical distribution. It appears clearly that in the \([400,500]\) nm range, both the curves are almost the same. Below 350 nm there is a hudge difference but that does not matter so much since in that wavelength the photocopic sensitivity and the Kuraray spectral distributions are equal to zero. With the 30 nm shifted spectral radiant sensitivity, the estimated value of the 400 (480) nm quantum efficiency is 20.6 (18.50)%, to be compared with measured values: 21.8 (19.1) %.

_Figure 9 : Relative radiant spectral sensitivity of a R5900 (PMT #6E06D2) that differ from the typical one. The shifted typical relative radiant spectral sensitivity is shown._

## 4. Estimation of the 480 nm quantum efficiency

The above described procedure had been applied to the 28 non "typical" PMT's. The left part of Figure 10 shows the 480 nm quantum efficiency for each of these PMT's before and after the shift of \(R(\lambda)\). The final 480 nm quantum efficiency for the whole set of PMTs is also presented in right part of Figure 10.

The averaged value is,

\[\langle\eta_{480}\rangle\ =\ 16.4\%\]

with a dispersion of 6.2%.

Two of the PMT's (# 6A31D4) and (# 6A12C7) cannot be corrected since for these PMTs the 10 nm step is too wide to allow to correct efficiently the ratio \(P_{0}/P_{1}\).

In order to test the sensitivity of the corrective method on the estimated ratio \(P_{0}/P_{1}\), one redo the 480 nm quantum efficiency determination of the non "typical" PMT's with the two extrema values for \(P_{0}/P_{1}\): 0.041 and 0.045. On average, the 480 nm quantum efficiency decreases from \(6.4\pm 1\%\) when \(P_{0}/P_{1}\) is going from 0.041 to 0.045. One will used this value to have an estimation of the systematic error for this method.

_Figure 10 : Right: Distribution of the final 480 nm quantum efficiency for the whole set of R5900. Left: 480 nm quantum efficiency for each of the non "typical" PMTs before (x-axis) and after (y-axis) the shift of \(\lambda_{0}\)._

The distribution of the \(\sigma\) values for the whole set of R5900 is shown in the left part of Figure 11. The averaged value of \(\sigma\) is the same as before any correction (76.6 mA/W), but now the dispersion is 6.5%.

The PMT's specific sensitivity to Kuraray fibres light emission (expressed in m A/W) is also represented in right part of Figure 11. The averaged value of \(S_{kura}\) is 73.4 mA/W, with a dispersion of 6.2%. All the data for the whole set of R5900 are summarized in Tables (8) and (9).

## 5. Cross-check of the method

Relative photocathode sensitivity measured with a 480 nm interferential filter is correlated with the 480 nm quantum efficiency. This measurement is not so strongly correlated since one should also take into account of the PMT's light collection efficiency. But as soon as the voltage between photocathode and all other tied dynodes is above 50 Volts, the measured photocathode current reach a plateau, and one could assume that this value is independant of the PMT's light collection efficiency (\(\sim 95\%\)).

The relative photocathode sensitivity of the 65 PMT's had been measured previously in four differents laboratories (Pisa, Valencia, Illinois, and Clermont) before their use in Module 0.

To be consistent we perform the cross-check with PMT's of a same subset of PMT's measured in one place, and used one of the sample as a reference. Figures 12 represent the correlation between the estimated 480 nm quantum efficiency (x-axis), and the photocathode current measured at the "plateau" with the 480 nm interferential filter (y-axis).

For each subset of PMT's, one of the samples had been used as a reference. We fix to 5% the systematic error on the relative 480 nm quantum efficiency, and 1.5% the systematic error on the relative photocathode current.

Figure 12: Correlation between the estimated 480 nm quantum efficiency (x-axis), and the photocathode current measured at the "plateau" with the 480 nm interferential filter (y-axis). For each subset of PMT's, one of the PMT had been used as a reference: #5M18C3 for Clermont subset, #5M27C5 for Valencia subset, #6A12C7 for Illinois subset and #6A31C4 for Pisa subset. We fix to 5% the systematic error on the relative estimated 480 nm quantum efficiency, and \(1.5\%\) the systematic error on the relative photocathode current.

Figure 13: Correlation between the estimated 480 nm quantum efficiency (x-axis), and the photocathode current measured at the "plateau" with the 480 nm interferential filter (y-axis). For each subset of PMT’s, one of the PMT had been used as a reference: #5M18C3 for Clermont subset, #5M27C5 for Valencia subset, #6A12C7 for Illinois subset and #6A31C4 for Pisa subset. We fix to 5% the systematic error on the relative estimated 480 nm quantum efficiency, and \(1.5\%\) the systematic error on the relative photocathode current.

In each subset, there is a correlation between the 480 nm quantum efficiency and the measured current.

Valencia subset seems to be more homogeneous, at least for 13 of them that belongs to the same manufacturer's serie (# 6A--).

In Illinois plot, one of the PMT's is out of range (# 6A24C6), and two of them (# 6A24C4 and 6A24C5) are very far from the correlation line.

Pisa group also measured directly the PMT's quantum efficiency, using a He-NE laser (543.5 nm) together with a calibrated EG&G photodiode [5].

From these measurements they estimate the 480 nm quantum efficiency for this same subset of PMT's. They only report 480 nm quantum efficiency, and found an averaged value of 16.6% with a 13% dispersion. In table (10) are reported the Pisa 480 nm measurements, together with our estimation for the same PMT's for both 480 and 540 nm. Using their measurements we plot in left part of Figure 13, the correlation between their measured 480 nm quantum efficiency (x-axis), and the photocathode current they measured at the "plateau" with the 480 nm interferential filter (y-axis). This plot could be directly compared to the bottom-left part of Figure 12 since we use the same PMT (# 6A31C4) as a reference. Now the correlation seems to be not so clear as in Figure 12.

The left part of Figure 13 shows the correlation between our estimation of the 480 nm quantum efficiency (x-axis) and their measurements of that quantum efficiency.

Figure 13: Left: Correlation between the Pisa measured 480 nm quantum efficiency (x-axis), and the photocathode current measured at the ”plateau” with the 480 nm interferential filter (y-axis). Right: Correlation between the Pisa measured 480 nm quantum efficiency (x-axis), and our estimation (y-axis).

Among this subset of samples, PMT #6A25D8 4 80 nm quantum efficiency had been measured in Pisa to only 12.8 %. This value is surprisingly very low when considering Hamamatsu "blue" photocathode luminous sensitivity (9.14 \(\mu\)A/lmb), as well as "white" photocathode luminous sensitivity (80.6 \(\mu\)A/lm) measurements for this PMT, since these values are above mean values for the whole set of R5900. For this PMT, our estimation is 16.5 %, and seems to be more compatible.

Using only the Pisa subset of PMT's, we found a mean value of the 480 nm quantum efficiency of,

\[\langle\eta_{480}\rangle\ =\ 16.5\%\]

with a dispersion of 6.5%. That is very close of the estimation for the whole set of 65 samples.

Using Pisa data the mean value of the 480 nm quantum efficiency for that same subset of PMT's is,

\[\langle\eta_{480}\rangle\ =\ 16.6\%\]

but with a dispersion of 13.9%.

Using for the same 15 PMT's, the Hamamatsu measured characteristics ("blue" photocathode luminous sensitivity), we found a dispersion of 5.5% only.

It is not so clear in the Pisa note on how the 480 nm quantum efficiency is deduced from the 543.5 nm measured one, but it is not easy to deduce it using a R5900 typical relative spectral sensitivity since in that subset of 15 PMT's, we tagged 12 of them as non "typical".

## 6 Conclusions

We try to estimate the 480 nm quantum efficiency of the 65 PMT's used for Module 0, using only the main PMT's characteristics,

- The "white" luminous photocathode sensitivity,

- The "blue" luminous photocathode sensitivity,

together with standard definitions of photometric and radiometric quantities, and a typical shape of the R5900 relative radiant spectral sensitivity.

Nevertheless one should take into account of the variation of the shape of that relative spectral radiant sensitivity. This variation generaly results in a shift of the spectral PMT sensitivity for higher values of the wavelength. Each different PMT is so tagged as "typical" or non "typical" by the comparison of two calculation of the PMT's 400 nm quantum efficiency: one using the typical shape as relative spectral radiant sensitivity, the second one using the direct measured "blue" photocathode luminous sensitivity.

This method had been tested on two specific PMT's, #5D17F4 ("typical") and #6E06D2( non "typical"), for which complete data had been provided by Hamamatsu. The 480 nm quantum efficiency estimation, as well as the corrective method are efficient for these two PMT's, and that is why the method had been applied to the 65 R5900's used in Module 0.

On the set of 65 PMT's, 37 of them had been tagged as "typical", i.e. 37 PMT's for which the relative radiant spectral sensitivity could be modelised by the function shown in Figure 2.

For the complementary subset of non "typical" PMT's, we correct the relative radiant spectral sensitivity by a global shift of the wavelength.

As a final result, we estimate that the 480 nm quantum efficiency is on the average of,

\[\langle\eta_{480}\rangle\ =\ 16.4\%\]

with a dispersion of 6.5%

In order to cross-check these estimations, we correlate that 480 nm quantum efficiencies with the 480 nm photocathode current measured at the "plateau" in the 4 different laboratories. These comparisons show clearly that these two set of data are correlated, indicating by theway that we could have some confidence in our estimation of the 480 nm quantum efficiency.

Finally we compared our estimation for the Pisa subset, with direct measurements they performed on these same PMT's. The two set of data are less correlated.

Using their measurements, they claimed that the dispersion is of the order 13.8%, when our estimation of this same dispersion is only of 6.2%.

It is clear that we need to perform a systematic measurement of the 480 nm quantum efficiency for the 10 000 PMT's that will be used in TILECAL. That is why we are designing now a calibrated bench for 480 nm radiation measurement using a Hamamatsu photodiode (S6337-01). This device have the same effective area that the R5900 photocathode (18 \(\times\) 18 mm), together with a high and uniform efficiency. The calibration of the bench will be performed independantly by the french "Laboratoire National d'Essais".
