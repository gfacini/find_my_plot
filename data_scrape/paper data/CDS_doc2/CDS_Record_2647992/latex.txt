Sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to long-lived particles with a displaced vertex and \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) signature at the HL-LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note presents the estimated sensitivity of a search for long-lived particles decaying within the tracking volume to multiple outgoing charged particles, using a signature of a displaced vertex and missing transverse momentum, in the upgraded ATLAS detector for the High-Luminosity LHC. The dataset is taken as 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. The replacement of the existing tracking detector with a full-silicon inner tracker (ITk) significantly changes the search sensitivity, which is estimated using extrapolations of the reconstruction capabilities for displaced tracks and displaced vertices from a combination of the performance of the current detector and a simulation of the proposed upgraded detector. Results are projected in the context of gluino \(R\)-hadron pair production. For long-lived gluinos which decay to SM quarks and a 100 GeV stable neutralino, ATLAS should have the sensitivity to discover \(R\)-hadrons with lifetimes from 0.1 to 10 ns with masses up to 2.8 TeV. In the absence of long-lived gluino production, the 95% CL upper limit on gluino masses will reach 3.4 TeV.

## 1 Introduction

One of the most intriguing scenarios of new physics to look for at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is new particles with measurably long lifetimes. Whether in the Standard Model (SM) or in new physics models, particles can acquire discernible lifetimes from a variety of mechanisms, including weak effective couplings to the final state due to heavy intermediate particles, which can arise in models with mass hierarchies, or due to small coupling constants, which can arise from conserved or nearly-conserved symmetries. Long lifetimes can also manifest due to decays that are phase-space suppressed or from new particles which interact only weakly with the SM particles via mediators.

If a new long-lived particle decays within the detector but at an observable distance from the proton-proton interaction point, and if its decay products include multiple charged particles reconstructed as tracks, it can produce a distinctive signature of an event containing at least one displaced vertex (DV). There are several recent papers at the LHC which have searched for displaced vertices, including Refs. [1; 2; 3].

This note presents a projection of the expected sensitivity of the analysis published in Ref. [2] in the context of the planned upgrades to the LHC and the ATLAS detector, presenting in detail and extending a study shown in Ref. [4]. The study assumes that the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) will deliver 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV to the ATLAS experiment, and it explores the effect that the geometry of the new inner tracker (ITk) of the upgraded ATLAS detector will have in extending the acceptance for reconstructing DVs.

The search presented here requires at least one displaced vertex reconstructed within the ITk, and events are required to have at least moderate missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)), which serves as a discriminant against background as well as an object on which to trigger. The analysis sensitivity is projected for a benchmark supersymmetry model of pair production of long-lived gluinos, as shown in Figure 1. Each gluino hadronizes into an \(R\)-hadron and decays through a heavy virtual squark into a pair of SM quarks and a stable neutralino with a mass of 100 GeV. Results are presented for discovery and exclusion potential are explored for several different gluino lifetimes and for varying masses of the gluino.

Figure 1: The benchmark model considered in this projection is a supersymmetric scenario with a long-lived gluino, which hadronizes after production into an \(R\)-hadron, and then decays through a virtual squark into a pair of SM quarks and a neutralino.

## 2 ATLAS Detector

ATLAS is a general-purpose detector1 with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical symmetry described in detail in Ref. [5]. For the purpose of this study, only the inner detector tracking system is described in detail below.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

The current ATLAS tracker, referred to in this note as the Run 2 inner detector (ID), is composed of three detector systems organized in concentric layers, and covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\), immersed in a 2 T superconducting solenoid. The outermost layer, the transition radiation tracker (TRT), consists of densely packed proportional gas-filled straw tubes [6]. The semiconductor tracker (SCT) is equipped with silicon microstrip detectors and occupies the radial region from roughly 300 mm to 550 mm [7]. The innermost layer consists of a silicon pixel detector [8], which was upgraded in 2015 with an additional innermost pixel layer [9]. The pixel detector typically provides four precision measurements (hits) for each track at radial distances of 33 mm, 50 mm, 88 mm and 122 mm from the LHC beam line, while the SCT has four layers that typically provide eight hits in total, as each layer is composed of of double-sided stereo strip sensors.

The central barrel portion of the Phase II ATLAS tracker, the ITk, will be composed of four double-sided silicon strip detectors and five layers of silicon pixel sensors [4; 10]. There will be no gaseous detector to replace the TRT in the ITk; the new-generation silicon strip and pixel sensors will fill the entire volume inside the solenoid. The pixel coverage will be extended from \(|\eta|<2.5\) to \(|\eta|<4.0\), and the pixel layers in the central region will be located at approximately 39 mm, 99 mm, 160 mm, 220 mm, and 279 mm. The distance between one silicon layer and the next layer will increase relative to the ID. For charged particles coming from the primary vertex at \(|\eta|\approx 0\), the typical number of silicon hits available for tracking will increase from twelve to thirteen, and will increase significantly more at higher \(|\eta|\). While the exact configuration of the pixel layers in the endcap region is not yet finalized, this study used the Inclined Duals geometry described in Ref. [4]. The ID and ITk layouts are shown in Figure 2 and the expected performance are summarized in Ref. [11]. In addition to the new layout for ITk, the pixel size will decrease relative to the current detector.

## 3 Analysis overview

In this study, the event selection closely follows the requirements in the recent Run 2 search for a DV and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)[2]. Events are required to have at least one DV in the ITk and at least five tracks must be associated to that vertex. To exclude hadronic interactions of SM particles, the vertex must not be located within a region of the detector filled with solid materials, and the invariant mass of the reconstructed vertex must be larger than 10. The event must pass the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) trigger and have reconstructed \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>200\).

Estimating the future sensitivity to the distinctive signature of a DV in a new detector with new reconstruction tools requires creative methods of extrapolation and necessitates several assumptions about the future layout and performance of the detector. As the tracks comprising the signal DVs have fewer hits and much larger impact parameters than tracks from the primary vertex, the reconstruction algorithmnects to cover a much wider tracking phase space than tracking for prompt particles. To efficiently reconstruct signal tracks, a custom, extended configuration of the ATLAS tracking software is required. This custom configuration, hereafter referred to as _displaced tracking_, is optimized for the Run 2 detector and software [12]. Similarly, a custom algorithm is required for reconstruction of the displaced vertices. These customizations depend heavily on the geometry of the tracker, and neither a dedicated displaced tracking nor DV reconstruction setup has yet been developed for the Phase II detectors.

Many ATLAS Phase II projection studies rely on simulated events which have been fully reconstructed by tracking software specially developed for finding prompt tracks in the Phase II detector. In other studies, generated Monte Carlo (MC) events are used to obtain particle-level kinematic properties, which are smeared by functions which estimate the future detector's performance. In this analysis, a hybrid approach is developed to estimate the prospective acceptance and efficiency for reconstructing and selecting displaced vertices. In this approach, particle-level Monte Carlo events are used to obtain kinematic distributions for the signal. The displaced tracking performance is estimated by factorizing the current displaced tracking performance into acceptance and efficiency terms, and assuming that the efficiency performance of the Run 2 algorithm will be reproduced for ITk for particles which pass the acceptance. The tracking acceptance is based on the number of hits left by a charged particle traversing the silicon sensors, and is calculated for the tracks of interest using a full simulation of the ITk geometry. The current DV performance is parameterized and extrapolated to the new detector geometry.

Other selections are either directly applied at particle-level to the signal events, or use the results of the Run 2 reinterpretation material which are publicly available [13] to estimate the efficiency. The background estimation is extrapolated from the Run 2 data-driven result, and systematic uncertainties are taken directly from the existing analysis.

## 4 Simulation samples

This study makes use of Monte Carlo simulation samples to obtain the kinematic properties of signal events, which are then used to estimate the efficiency for selecting signal events. The pair production of gluinos from proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) was simulated in Pythia 6.428 [14] at leading order with the AUET2B [15] set of tuned parameters for the underlying event and the CTEQ6L1 [16] parton distribution function (PDF) set. The gluino mass, \(m_{\tilde{g}}\), ranges from 2.0 to 3.8 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). After production, the gluino hadronizes into an \(R\)-hadron and is propagated through the ATLAS detector by Geant4 [17; 18] until it decays. Pythia 6.428 is called to decay the gluino into a pair of SM quarks and a neutralino and models the three-body decay of the gluino, fragmentation of the remnants of the light-quark system, and hadronization of the decay products. The gluino lifetime ranges from 0.1 ns to 10 ns, and the neutralino mass is fixed to 100 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). In this study, only particle-level information about the \(R\)-hadron's decay products is used.

To normalize the expected number of signal events in the full HL-LHC dataset, the cross-sections for pair production of gluinos are calculated at next-to-leading order at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) using Prospino[19], assuming no contribution from the squark. The resummation of soft-gluon emission is taken into account at next-to-leading-logarithm accuracy (NLO+NLL) for cross-sections for gluino masses up to 3.5 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\), beyond which a linear extrapolation of the correction for the NLL term is performed [20]. Uncertainties on the cross-section prediction are taken by varying the choice of PDF set and factorization and renormalization scales, as described in Ref. [21], with a reduction of 50% applied to the uncertainties to account for improvements by the time the analysis will be performed. This approach is also consistent with the expected improvements in PDF uncertainties described in Ref. [22].

## 5 Projection of displaced tracking performance

Both standard and displaced tracking reconstruction in the ATLAS ID require that each track have at least seven silicon-detector hits, where each side of the double-sided SCT strips counts as a hit. For a typical particle in the central part of the current ATLAS detector travelling away from the interaction point, the maximum radial distance at which a particle can originate and still have seven silicon hits is approximately 300 mm, the first layer of the SCT. Previous studies on reconstructing displaced tracks in the ID found that for simulated particles which do produce seven silicon hits, the probability of reconstructing a track is between 90-100% for a radius of production in the transverse plane, \(r_{\mathrm{prod}}\), from 0 mm to 300 mm [12].

For this study, it is assumed that the tracking algorithms in Phase II will be able to match the current performance. Therefore, the total efficiency for reconstructing displaced tracks is factorized into an algorithmic efficiency, \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{alg}}\), and a fiducial acceptance, \(A_{\mathrm{fid}}\), where \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{alg}}\) is the probability of reconstructing a track given a particle has deposited at least seven silicon hits, and \(A_{\mathrm{fid}}\) is the fraction of particles which deposit at least seven hits. \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{alg}}\) is taken to be 100% in this study. While this is consistent with the current performance, the increased instantaneous luminosity of the HL-LHC will make it more difficult to efficiently find tracks with large impact parameter. However, this study assumes that the following factors will work to mitigate the effect of high pileup: 1) the increase in the number of silicon layers is expected to increase the ability to separate tracks from actual prompt particles from combinatoric fakes, thereby mitigating the potential problem of fake prompt tracks claiming hits from displaced particles, 2) the increased resolution of the pixel detector will help to mitigate efficiency loss due to pileup, and 3) thecollaboration will continue to adapt the tracking and vertexing algorithms until the era of the HL-LHC to deal with the more difficult conditions.

To estimate \(A_{\rm fid}\) for the ITk layout, the particles from the \(R\)-hadron decay are propagated through a detailed simulation of the ITk Inclined Duals geometry using their generator-level radius of production and momentum vector. Only charged decay products with \(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV are considered. Along each particle's trajectory, the number of active silicon layers traversed, \(N_{\rm Si}\), is recorded, as well as the integrated amount of active and passive material traversed from one hit to the other in terms of the nuclear interaction length, \(N_{\lambda}\). Each sensor's hit efficiency is assumed to be 100%. The effects of multiple scattering are not included. The probability that each particle reaches the next silicon strip layer of the tracker volume without undergoing a hadronic interaction is estimated as \(\rm e^{-N_{\lambda}}\). \(A_{\rm fid}\) is taken as the ratio of the number of particles with \(N_{\rm Si}\geq 7\) that do not undergo a hadronic interaction divided by the total number of particles.

In Figure 3, the total tracking efficiency calculated using this method is shown, for the decay products of \(R\)-hadrons with a mass of 2.0 TeV which decay with a mean proper lifetime of 1 ns. The tracking efficiency is shown as a function of the \(R\)-hadron decay position.2 As \(\epsilon_{\rm alg}\) is taken to be 100%, the total tracking efficiency is simply \(A_{\rm fid}\), and is shown with and without the effects of hadronic interactions due to material. The tracking efficiency is shown for the ITk as well as the Run 2 ID geometry. The steep drop off in efficiency in the present ID at around 300 mm corresponds to the farthest radial extent of the first layer of the SCT, after which it is unlikely that a typical particle would traverse seven strip layers. In the ITk, the equivalent drop-off does not occur until after 400 mm due to the larger spacing between the silicon layers. Similar tracking efficiencies are observed within statistical uncertainty for the decay products of \(R\)-hadron with a range of of gluino masses, lifetimes, and neutralino masses.

Footnote 2: The values of the \(R\)-hadron decay radius, \(r_{\rm DV}\), and the radius of the decay products production,\(r_{\rm prod}\), are identical at the MC generator level for the \(R\)-hadron model used in this note, but \(r_{\rm DV}\) is preferentially used when focusing on the vertex properties, while \(r_{\rm prod}\) is used when focusing on the outgoing particles.

Figure 3: The probability that a charged particle, with \(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV produced in the decay of a 2.0 TeV \(R\)-hadron with a lifetime of 1 ns, passes through at least seven silicon layers, as a function of the decay radius of the \(R\)-hadron, for both the Run 2 and ITk detector layouts [4]. The probability is shown with and without the simulated effect of material producing hadronic interactions.

## 6 Projection of displaced vertexing performance

The configuration of the algorithm for reconstructing displaced vertices has recently been optimized within ATLAS for finding signals such as decaying \(R\)-hadrons. The efficiency of reconstructing a displaced vertex is measured in simulation as a function of the number of reconstructed tracks which belong to the vertex at generator-level, \(n_{\mathrm{tracks}}\), and the radius of the vertex position in the transverse plane, \(r_{\mathrm{DV}}\).

For this study, it is assumed that similar performance of the vertexing algorithms can be achieved in Phase II. However, given the different geometry of ITk relative to the current detector, the vertexing efficiency measured for Run 2 can not be applied directly to this study. The Run 2 vertex efficiency is parametrized and extrapolated as described below.

The Run 2 vertex efficiency is parameterized as a function of \(r_{\mathrm{DV}}\) for bins of \(n_{\mathrm{tracks}}\). One of the main reasons that the reconstruction efficiency depends on \(n_{\mathrm{tracks}}\) is due to the fact that the number of trials of vertex forming using seed tracks increases with \(n_{\mathrm{tracks}}\). The efficiency is fit with a function which smoothly combines an error function at low \(r_{\mathrm{DV}}\) to model the initial rise in efficiency, a linear plateau, and an error function at high \(r_{\mathrm{DV}}\) to model the falling off of efficiency near the beginning of the SCT. The fit values are compared across all bins of \(n_{\mathrm{tracks}}\), and some smoothing of values is performed for bins which suffer from poor statistics.

To extrapolate from the Run 2 efficiency to the expected performance at ITk, the same fit values are used for each bin of \(n_{\mathrm{tracks}}\). However, the mean of the error function used to model the turn-off is moved from 300 mm to 400 mm to reflect the change in the location of the inner silicon strip layer.

The vertex efficiency parameterized in this way in shown in Figure 4 for the case where \(n_{\mathrm{tracks}}=10\). The efficiency is shown as fit in the Run 2 measurement and as extrapolated to ITk. Also shown is the plateau of the efficiency as a function of \(n_{\mathrm{tracks}}\) for the ITk extrapolation, assumed to be the same as that measured in Run 2.

(b) The plateau of the vertex efficiency as a function of \(n_{\mathrm{tracks}}\) for the ITk geometry.

## 7 Event selection

The event selection efficiency is estimated on signal events for the following selections:

* Event must pass \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) trigger and have offline \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>250\) GeV.
* Event must have at least one displaced vertex which passes the following requirements:
* the vertex is not located in a region of the detector with material;
* the vertex must contain at least 5 reconstructed tracks;
* the invariant mass of the reconstructed tracks in the vertex, \(m_{\mathrm{DV}}\), must be larger than 10 GeV.
* Each reconstructed track must satisfy:
* \(6\,\mathrm{mm}<r_{\mathrm{prod}}<400\) mm;
* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV;

The efficiency of passing the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) trigger and offline \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) requirements is taken from the Run 2 analysis, as parameterized in Ref. [13] as a function of the generator-level \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and the decay radius of the \(R\)-hadron in the event which decays the farthest from the interaction point. The generator-level \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is calculated as the magnitude of the transverse component of the vector sum of the momenta of the stable, weakly-interacting particles in the final state. For an event in which the farthest \(R\)-hadron decays before the calorimeter, the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) efficiency plateaus near 100% for generator-level \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) of 500 GeV, while the plateau is between 80-90% for decays inside or after the calorimeter.

The efficiency of the material veto is estimated with a material map derived from a detailed geometry model of the ITk implemented in Geant4 [17; 18], which is used for the full Phase II MC simulations. All locations of passive and active material within the boundaries of 1200 mm in the radial (\(r\)) dimension and 3000 mm in longitudinal dimension (\(z\)) are stored in a binned \(r\)-\(z\) projection of the ITk. For each \(R\)-hadron decay in an event, the position of the \(R\)-hadron decay is checked against the map. If the decay vertex is consistent with any material, the vertex is not considered further. For a \(R\)-hadron with a mass of 2.0 TeV and lifetime of 1 ns which decays into a 100 GeV neutralino, roughly 60% of the signal events pass the material veto.

For each \(R\)-hadron which passes the material selection, an estimation is made of which of its decay products would be reconstructed as a track with a random sampling of the displaced tracking efficiencies. It is parameterized as a function of the particle production radius, as calculated in Section 5. Only charged decay products with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV, \(|\eta|<5\), and with 6 mm \(<r_{\mathrm{prod}}<400\) mm are considered. The requirements on the track's production radius at truth level approximates a selection on the radius of a reconstructed vertex. If at least five charged particles of the decay are within the fiducial acceptance and modeled as reconstructed, then the invariant mass of those particles, \(m_{\mathrm{DV}}\), is calculated, assuming all are pions.

If \(m_{\mathrm{DV}}>10\) GeV, the vertex is accepted based on a random-sampling of the vertex reconstruction efficiency computed in Section 6, which depends on the number of tracks and the vertex radius \(r_{\mathrm{DV}}\). If at least one vertex is accepted in an event, the event is considered to have passed all selections, and an event weight is applied based on the event \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) efficiency.

## 8 Background

In the search for events with a displaced vertex and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) in Run 2, the main source of background arises from hadronic interactions of SM particles with residual material not accounted for in the material map (such as gas molecules) and from low-mass vertices, such as from the decay of a SM hadron, which are either merged, or which are crossed by an unrelated, high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) track which promotes the vertex to higher \(m_{\mathrm{DV}}\). The contribution from different background sources was estimated independently in control regions in data and tested in validation regions. The total expected background for 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) was estimated to be \(0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.01}\) events.

Given that the background for this search is entirely instrumental in nature, it would not be reliable to perform a simulation-based projection of the expected background for a different detector and different reconstruction algorithms. Therefore, for the purpose of this projection, two different extrapolations of the size of current background are performed.

The default extrapolation assumes that the background will scale linearly with the size of the dataset, resulting in an expected background of \(1.8^{+1.8}_{-0.9}\) events. However, several handles could be tightened in the analysis selection to continue to reject background without introducing appreciable signal efficiency loss. For example, additional requirements on the vertex goodness-of-fit or the compatibility of each track with the vertex could be imposed to further reduce backgrounds from low-mass vertices which are merged or crossed by an unrelated track. Therefore, a more optimistic scenario is also considered in which the total background is kept to the current level of \(0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.01}\) events.

## 9 Results

The expected number of selected \(R\)-hadron events in the full HL-LHC dataset of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Figure 5 for different gluino masses and lifetimes. This note focuses on the 0.1-10 ns lifetime range, which is expected to be the most sensitive range for this analysis. The sensitivity is expected to gradually drop off at lifetimes shorter than 0.1 ns, and below 0.01 ns searches for other signatures are expected to perform better.

To estimate the potential discovery and exclusion sensitivity, an estimate is needed of the uncertainty on the number of expected signal events. The signal selection uncertainties are taken to have the same relative size as in the existing Run 2 analysis. The uncertainties on the cross-sections for gluino pair production are described in Section 4. Finally, the uncertainties on the number of expected background events are taken to be the same relative amount as in the existing analysis, for both scenarios of the background size.

Using the number of expected signal and background events with their respective uncertainties, the expected exclusion limit at 95% confidence level (CL) on the gluino mass, as a function of lifetime, is calculated assuming no signal presence. In the case that signal is present, the \(3\sigma\) evidence and \(5\sigma\) discovery reaches are also calculated. Both the exclusion and discovery reach are estimated in the two background scenarios described in Section 8: linearly scaling it with integrated luminosity, and keeping the same value as in the Run 2 analysis. The exclusion and observation reach are calculated with pseudo-experiments following the \(\mathrm{CL_{s}}\) prescription [23]. The results are shown in Figure 6 for both background scenarios.

For an expected background of \(1.8^{+1.8}_{-0.9}\) events, ATLAS should have sensitivity to a \(5\sigma\) discovery of a gluino \(R\)-hadron decaying to SM quarks and a 100 GeV neutralino with masses up to 2.8 TeV over a range of lifetimes from 0.1 ns to above 10 ns. For the optimistic background scenario of \(0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.01}\) background events expected, the projected discovery reach goes up to 2.9 TeV at a lifetime of 1 ns.

In the absence of long-lived gluino production, this analysis is projected to be able to exclude at the 95% CL \(R\)-hadrons with masses up to 3.3 TeV for lifetimes from 3 ns to above 10 ns, and up to 3.4 TeV for lifetimes between 0.1 ns and 3 ns, assuming the scaled background estimate. For the smaller background scenario, the 95% CL exclusion is above 3.4 TeV for the whole lifetime range, and up to 3.5 TeV around 1 ns. The significant increase in sensitivity relative to the ATLAS result with 33 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV comes in part from the increase in collision energy and integrated luminosity. For longer lifetimes, a significant gain in selection efficiency and therefore reach is due to the larger volume of the silicon tracker, which allows displaced tracks and displaced vertices to be reconstructed at larger radii. This pushes the radius at which tracks from long-lived particles can be efficiently reconstructed from 300 to 400 mm, with corresponding gain in acceptance for longer lifetimes. While the existing analysis with the Run 2 ID loses sensitivity for \(R\)-hadrons with lifetimes of 10 ns or longer, it is expected that a similar analysis with the ITk will have sensitivity for lifetimes up to and beyond 10 ns.

While the results presented here were studied only for a fixed neutralino mass of 100 GeV, based on the results in Ref. [2], comparable sensitivity is expected over a large range of neutralino masses. As the neutralino mass increases for a fixed gluino mass, the multiplicity and momentum of the visible SM particles decreases, which in turn decreases the efficiency of the requirements on the track multiplicity, vertexing reconstruction, and vertex invariant mass as the difference between the neutralino mass and the gluino mass, \(m_{DV}\), falls below 400 GeV. To efficiently select events with low \(m_{DV}\), it is especially important to retain high \(\epsilon_{\rm alg}\) and high vertexing efficiency in the HL-LHC conditions. Moreover, new background estimation techniques could allow a future analysis to relax the requirement on track multiplicity. While such studies require data and full reconstruction and are therefore beyond the scope of this note, future advances in reconstruction or analysis techniques could significantly improve the sensitivity to signals with fewer visible decay products due to a compressed mass spectrum or different signal models.

Figure 5: The number of expected \(R\)-hadron events selected for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV as a function of the gluino lifetime and gluino mass for gluinos which decay to SM quarks and a neutralino with a mass of 100 GeV.

Figure 6: The projected sensitivity for the upper limit on the mass of a gluino \(R\)-hadron that can be observed with \(3\sigma\) and \(5\sigma\) confidence or excluded at 95% CL, as a function of the gluino lifetime, for (a) a background of \(1.8^{+1.8}_{-0.9}\) events and (b) a background of \(0.02^{+0.02}_{-0.01}\) events. These results are valid for a gluino which decays to SM quarks and a stable neutralino with a mass of 100. Results assume 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) collected with the upgraded ATLAS detector, and are compared to the observed ATLAS exclusion limits for a dataset of 33 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\).

## 10 Conclusion

The upgraded energy and the larger dataset expected from the HL-LHC will increase significantly the sensitivity to new, heavy, long-lived particles. For models with a signature of a displaced vertex within the tracker and moderate \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), the larger silicon volume of the upgraded ATLAS detector will further extend the reach for lifetimes longer than 10 ns. For 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, ATLAS could discover gluino \(R\)-hadrons with masses up to 2.8 TeV and lifetimes from 0.1 ns to 10 ns, when the gluino decays to SM quarks and a 100 GeV stable neutralino. In the absence of long-lived gluino production, the 95% CL upper limit on gluino masses is projected to reach or exceed 3.4 TeV.
