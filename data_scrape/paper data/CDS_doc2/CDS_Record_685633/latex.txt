The special designed drift chamber is used to measure deflection angle of drifting electrons in crossed electric and magnetic fields. Fig.1. shows a schematic view of the apparatus. The drift chamber is placed in air gap between magnet poles where uniform magnetic field up to 6 kG is created.

The drift chamber has drift gap with maximal drift distance of 7 cm and single sense wire. The uniform electric field is created by two planes of wires with uniformly distributed potential. The thickness of gap is 10 mm. The sense wire is separated from drift gap by grounded cathode foil with small window through which drifting electrons can go to sense wire.

The electron beam is produced by radioactive source Sr\({}^{90}\). Its width is defined by collimators. The electrons go through the chamber and trigger small plastic scintillator. The scintillation light is transmitted through light-guide to PM which is placed out of magnet. The scintillation counter and radioactive source are mounted on the same platform and can be moved in y-direction parallel to the sense wire simultaneously. The counting rate of wire will depend on position of platform with source and for zero magnetic field it will be largest when source will be in front of slit in cathode foil. In presence of magnetic field the position of source when counting rate maximum occurs will be displaced due to Lorentz angle. So, as it is seen in fig.1(a), to measure deflection angle we must measure the dependence of the sense wire counting rate as a function of Y-coordinate of source for two X-positions.

2. RESULTS

The counting rate of sense wire as a function of Y-coordinate of source is shown in fig.2 for several values of electric field strength. The counting rate is number of sense wire pulses in coincidence with scintillation counter trigger when gate was 2\(\mu\)s. The clear peak is visible when source is moved along wire.

The width of peak (FWHM) is less than 5 mm. The fig.2 proves the capability of apparatus to measure Lorentz angle. The angle is defined as

tan(0)={{(Y(B,X2)-Y(0,X2)}-{(Y(B,X1)-Y(0,X1)})/(X2-X1),

where Xi is X-coordinates of source (1=!,2); Y(B,Xi) or Y(0, Xi) is a mean value of gaussian fit for counting rate dependence on y-coordinate of source at fixed X1 and with (B) or without (0) magnetic field. The difference {(Y(B,X)-Y(0,X)} is relative change of counting rate dependence maximum due to magnetic field for drift coordinate X. The result for Ar+6%CO2 is presented in fig.3 where the measured deflection angle as a function of electric field strength is shown for magnetic field 2.8 kG.

3. CONCLUSION

The technique for measurement of Lorentz angle in crossed electric and magnetic field is developed. Its capability is proved. Now we are working on increasing of magnetic field in air gap between poles as much as 8 kG. After finish of the work we shall start systematic measurement. The simultaneous drift velocity measurement is considered also.
