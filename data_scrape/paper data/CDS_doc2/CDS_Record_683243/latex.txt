macmail.cern.ch_Introduction

The electronics in ATLAS will dissipate a large amount of power : the USA 15 underground technical cavern will be equipped with 250 racks and approximately 150 will be mounted around the detector. Assuming that in the cavern each rack contains 5 VMEbus-9U crates dissipating 2kW each, the total power dissipated would amount to 2.5MW ; similar assumptions can be drawn for the crates around the detector.

The possibility of removing the heat from the electronics by water cooling is being investigated. It should allow consistent savings on air-conditioning and, in addition, the elimination of ventilating fans.

In ATLAS, it has been decided to look for a general purpose solution, one that could profit to other potential users. Therefore a standard VMEbus crate type V 430 (1), equipped with modules complying with the standard VMEbus dimensions, have been used. For the cooling system, the LCS (2) developed at CERN, has been adopted. When facing the task of water cooling the electronics, two main sources of heat should be considered: the electronics modules and the power supplies. Both of them have been addressed by the tests here referred.

## 2 Water Cooling the VMEbus Modules

The tests have been made on a rack, equipped with the LCS cooling system (Fig. 1). Two crates type V 430, without the ventilating fans, have been mounted on the rack. They were equipped with a V 431 (J1, J2, Jaux) backplane and a V 429 power supply, with its fans. To simulate commercial modules and obtain the necessary flexibility in the power dissipation, a module equipped with resistors has been developed: its dissipation can be varied in the range 0 to 62 W, by actuating front panel switches (Fig. 2). The cooler consisted of a double wall metal frame, its thickness being approximately 1.5 mm (Fig. 3).

Fifty modules have been built, to fully equip the two crates. The coolers have been made in the industry (3), and mounted on the modules at CERN.

A series of tests have been performed to evaluate the influence of the distance cooler to module on the cooling efficiency. A test module has been equipped with twelve temperature probes (Fig. 2). Some of them measured the input (3-10) and the output (1-2) air temperature, two of them the input and output water temperature (11-12). Probes 4 to 9 were mounted on critical regions of the module. The cooler distance could be varied between 0 and 4 mm in steps of 0.5 mm. The results of these measurements are shown in Fig. 4. In this case the cooler was mounted on the component side of the card.

The cooler can also be mounted on the soldering side of the card. The effect of its mounting at a distance of 1.5 mm from both sides is shown in Fig. 5.

To enhance the heat removal from the modules, tests have been performed with thermally conductive elastomeric materials, silicone rubbers charged with ceramics powders of high thermal conductivity [(4)].

A Gap-Pad rubber layer 3 mm thick has been inserted in a module between the soldering side of the PC board and the cooler. To ascertain the effect of the rubber, two series of tests have been done, with and without rubber. The result of these measurements are reported in Fig. 6. When the rubber is used, a considerable reduction of the probes temperature, of the order of 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C, is obtained. If these preliminary results should be confirmed by tests of water cooled commercial modules, a significant improvement of the electronics M.T.B.F. could be expected.

## 3 Water Cooling the Power Supply

A prototype water cooled power supply has been developed, in collaboration with an industrial partner [(5)]. The unit dimensions are the same as the VMEbus standard type V 429, to allow its accommodation in a standard crate. The unit architecture is similar to the V 429 : a modular system based on independent power modules that can be assembled in the unit according to the user requirements. The prototype is equipped with one power module. Two additional modules insure the a/c. mains and the monitoring and control services. A sketch of the unit is shown in Fig. 7. The water cooling is obtained by water flow inside a main radiator. Two secondary radiators, in thermal contact with the main one, cool down a 500 W (5.2 V-100A ) power module. A layer of silicone rubber is inserted between the module card and one of the secondary radiators.

The unit has been enclosed in a expanded polystyrene insulating box, 2 cm thick, to minimize heat dispersion in the room and allow measurements of the water cooling efficiency, once the supply was connected to the LCS cooling system (Fig. 8). The test of this unit has started recently, therefore many measurements have not yet been done. In Fig 9 a block diagram of the supply is shown. The input power, the power delivered to the load and the power distribution inside the unit are reported. The table at the end summarizes some recent findings. It can be said that when the unit delivers its maximum power to the load (500 W), about 145 W are dissipated in the power module. The water cooling carries away approximately 83 W, the cooling efficiency being of the order of 57%.

Future tests will include water cooling of commercial modules and measurements of the overall efficiency of the cooling system for a crate and a rack. In the case of the power supply, it is thought that the cooling efficiency is too low. This can probably be ascribed to the partial water cooling adopted in the unit, where, as it can be seen in Fig. 7, the heat is transmitted to the cooling element by thermal conduction only. Direct water cooling of all modular units contained in the supply should radically improve the cooling efficiency. A prototype made according to this principle is being developed by the industry (6) and should be available for testing by the middle of the year. Other suggestions are welcomed.

This work has been done with the help of M. Bosteels and P. Bonneau, who has prepared the LCS system, P. Fontaine-Vive Roux who has performed many tests and the encouragement of H.F. Hoffmann and M. Hatch. Many thanks to all of them.
