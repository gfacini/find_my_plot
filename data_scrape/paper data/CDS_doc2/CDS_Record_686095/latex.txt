###### Abstract

Because a liquid argon calorimeter employs high voltage in its operation sparking can occur; a discharge through a preamplifier caused by a spark may destroy the preamplifier. In this note a spark induced discharge in an EST electrode structure is compared to the discharge in a customary electrode structure and found to be typically a factor of 10 to 40 smaller in the EST structure.

## Introduction

One of the important considerations in liquid argon calorimeter design is the protection of the preamplifiers when a gap discharges due to a spark. A common cause of failure of the preamplifier is the overheating of its FET by the current produced during a spark1. Protection of the preamplifiers is imperative when it is not feasible to replace damaged ones. In the following the discharge produced from an electrostatic transformer (EST) gap electrode structure2 is compared with that from a standard gap electrode structure

Historically, the EST was invented to better match the load capacitance to the preamplifier as an alternative to the use of ferrite toroid transformers since ferrite toroid transformers are not suitable for use in strong magnetic fields. Subsequent developments3 have adapted the EST electrode structure for use in wide argon gaps which allows the use of standard gap voltages as well as operation at higher luminosity.

### Standard Gap Design

Liquid argon sampling calorimeters are constructed using a series of plates of absorber material with a liquid argon filled gap between each pair of them. An electrode structure located within each gap measures the ionization in the liquid argon from high energy particle showers. In a standard gap electrode structure the signal electrode normally is centered between two absorber plates. Fig. 1 shows a schematic of such a typical standard gap design. For simplicity only one half of the electrode structure is shown. The missing structure would be represented by a mirror image at the ground side of the signal decoupling capacitor.

To assure efficient charge transfer to the preamplifier, the decoupling capacitor will have several times the gap capacitance. In many designs the decoupling capacitor is made from a sheet of G10 or Kapton where a copper pad on one side serves as the gap electrode and a second pad on the opposite side serves as the signal electrode. In the case where Kapton is used, the decoupling capacitance is \(\sim\)40 times the gap capacitance. A factor of 20 comes from the much larger separation between the gap electrodes than between the decoupling electrodes. A factor of \(\sim\)2 comes from the larger dielectric constant of Kapton compared to liquid argon.

When a high voltage, V, is applied across the argon gap, then a charge q = CgV appears on the gap electrodes and a charge q' = CdV appears on the decoupling capacitor. When a spark occurs across the argon gap, which we treat as shorting out the gap, a charge q flows to ground and a voltage -V appears on the signal electrode. To return the signal electrode to ground, a charge q' flows through the preamplifier. We note that when Kapton is used a factor of about 40 more charge flows through the preamplifier than if just the charge associated with the gap capacitance were to be released. To keep the discharge through the preamplifier to a minimum, the coupling capacitance should be kept modest by making the signal electrode much smaller than the pad so as to reduce the decoupling capacitance down to the minimum required. A factor of \(\sim\)10 is required to achieve good charge transfer but a factor of \(\sim\)40 is dangerous overkill.

### EST Gap Design

Fig. 2 shows a schematic of a typical gap design for an electrostatic transformer (EST) gap structure. Again for simplicity we show only one half of the structure. This arrangement would be appropriate to a situation where the spacing between absorber plates was \(\sim\)8 mm.

Figure 1:

Figure 2.

As before when a high voltage, V, is applied to the argon gaps, a charge q = C\({}_{\mbox{g}}\)V appears on the gap electrodes and a charge q' = C\({}_{\mbox{d}}\) V appears on the decoupling capacitors. If the argon gap on the left in Fig. 2 is suddenly shorted, then the voltage -V appears at the preamplifier input as before. Now however the amount of charge transfer necessary to restore the voltage at the preamplifier to zero is much smaller than for the standard electrode structure. Since q' is much larger than q, after an amount of charge q moves through the preamplifier, the voltage across the second argon gap becomes -2V, the voltage across each of the two decoupling capacitors stays about -V. Hence the voltage at preamplifier is restored to zero and charge stops flowing. More precisely the charge \(\delta\) that flows through the preamplifier is

\[\delta=\frac{C_{d}C_{g}}{(C_{d}+2C_{g})}V=C_{g}V.\]

The voltage V' appearing across the unshorted argon gap (on the right in Fig. 2) is given by

\[V=\left(1+\frac{C_{d}}{(C_{d}+2C_{g})}\right)V=2V.\]

Efficient charge transfer implies C\({}_{\mbox{d}}>>\) C\({}_{\mbox{g}}\) just as in the standard gap case and hence the limiting case of \(\delta=\) C\({}_{\mbox{g}}\)V and V' = 2V are a good approximations. We also note that for the analysis to be appropriate, the argon gaps must be able to withstand 2V for a short time.

The same analysis holds if he second argon gap, the one on the left in Fig. 2, were to short. A charge q moves through the preamplifier and a voltage 2V appears across the argon gap on the right in Fig. 2.

For completeness we calculate the change in energy stored in the capacitors from the time immediately after the spark to the time where the voltage at the preamplifier has returned to zero. For simplicity we the use the limit where q' >>q. The energy lost to each of the decoupling capacitors is qV while that gained by the argon capacitor is 1/2Cg(2V)2 - 1/2CgV2 = 3/2CgV2 = 3/2qV. Hence a net 1/2qV energy is lost in the process.

## Conclusion

We find that when a spark occurs in a standard gap design, the discharge through the preamplifier is many times the charge required to generate the voltage across the gap. Efficient charge transfer keeps this amount of charge large. In contrast, the EST gap structure limits the charge through the preamplifier to only the charge necessary to generate the gap voltage. Hence the EST design is much more benign in terms of preamplifier safety.
