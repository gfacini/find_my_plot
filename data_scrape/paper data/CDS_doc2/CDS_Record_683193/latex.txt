###### Abstract

In this paper we present a summary of the present calorimetry design as it is used in the official ATLAS simulation (DICE) for the Technical Proposal. Dimensions, material distributions, as well as useful informations about data and code access, are collected in order to better coordinate the work needed for the Technical Proposal in terms of calorimetry understanding and optimization. This note and all figures are available in PS format on the ATLAS WWW page (Software).

Dimensions of the barrel EM calorimeter in DICE

### separate preshower mode

The dimensions are described starting from the internal radius. When no dimension is specified for " ends at", it is where the next item starts. The official datacards to be used for this mode are "ATL_TP0.datacard" (panel tracker) or "ATL_TP2.datacard" (Annecy tracker).

* panel tracker layout (or Annecy tracker layout)
* no moderator in the barrel
* coil description: the geometry of the coil is defined in routine COILGEO, the defaults in routine COILDF3 in the DICE cmz package. The field is kept constant at 2T up to the end of the cavity. The version of the coil is the short one with a maximum Z of 2700 mm. All cryostats are defined in the CRYODF3 default routine, which already contains the description of the latest Aluminium version of the cryostats (Saclay design).

The material for G10 is the same used in the accordion description (epoxy, material number 37 with \(X_{0}=22\) cm). The electronics and cables are a mixture of LAr (70%) and plexiglas (30%) (\(X_{0}=20\) cm). The preshower strips are defined at the step level (COPSSTE), in the default the granularity is chosen to be \(\Delta\eta=0.100\) and \(\Delta\phi=0.0031\) in the first active layer, \(\Delta\eta=0.0031\) and \(\Delta\phi=0.098\) in the second active layer. Longitudinally the preshower extends up to the end of the calorimeter (Z=3200 mm).

* **Accordion EM calorimeter: the geometry definition is in routine ACCPGEO and the defaults in ACCPDEF (see also CAL-NO-70 and RD3 Note 41). The sampling fraction of the calorimeter is changed at \(\eta=0.9\) by changing the Pb thickness from 1.85 mm to 1.2 mm. The overall plate thickness is kept constant by increasing the amount of glue. The support structure of the accordion is simulated with an average 5 mm thick steel cylinder. All material beyond this cylinder in radius are part of the cryostat definition (CRYODF3). No material of the barrel EM calorimeter exceeds \(\eta\)=1.4. This particular corner is filled with excluder material (air in the simulation). The calorimeter is segmented in three samplings in depth. The sampling thicknesses (constant at fixed radius) are 8.55, 8.0 and 7.66 \(X_{0}\) respectively at \(\eta=0\).** **Item Material** **Starts at (mm) ends at (mm)** **calc electronics elect 1482 1512** **calc support bars G10 1512 1532** **gap nose LAr (inactive) 1532 1545** **accordion zigs ACCORD ACTIVE 1545 1980** **gap tail LAr (inactive) 1980 1993** **calc support bars G10 1993 2013** **calc elect(outer) elect 2013 2053** **clearance LAr 2503 2098** **support(averaged) Fe 2098 2103** **clearance LAr 2103 2140**

#### 1.1.1 material distribution

Figure 2 shows the passive material distribution in front of the first and second active layer of the preshower, and in front of the active part of the barrel accordion calorimeter. In A this is done without the tapered lead layer in front of the preshower. In B 2 \(X_{0}\) are forced in front of layer 1 and 3 \(X_{0}\) in front of layer 2. The tracking material (panel design) is taken into account (see also Figure 1). It can be seen that the desired amount of material can be controlled up to \(\eta=1.1\) for the first preshower layer and up to \(\eta=1.4\) for the second preshower layer. Figure 3 shows in detail the material distribution up to \(\eta=1.1\) for the second preshower layer. The tracking material is then fed to the front of the preshower layer and the tracking material is fed to the front of the preshower layer.

## 2 Dimensions of the end-cap EM calorimeter in DICE

### separate preshower mode

The dimensions are described starting from the internal Z position. When no dimension is specified for " ends at", it is where the next item starts.

* end-cap moderator from 3400 mm to 3450 mm
* cryostat description in the routine CRYOGEO, the defaults in the routine CRYODF2 in the DICE cmz package. All cryostat walls are made out of Aluminium. The two front walls (cold and warm) are 3 cm thick.

* separate preshower : described in routine COPEGEO, with defaults in COPEDF2. The preshower coverage extends from 1.4 to 2.6 in rapidityFigure 8: material distribution in the tracker (panel version) in front of the end-cap moderator

* accordion EM calorimeter: the geometry is in routine ENDEGEO and the defaults in ENDEDF3. This is still a plate calorimeter with the same sampling fraction and thickness as the Spanish Fan. The exact accordion geometry is still missing. The maximum radius is 2000 mm and the maximum \(\eta\) coverage is 3.2 (back of the accordion). 

* LAr HAD end-cap : it is a plate calorimeter, with geometry defined in routine ENDHGE2 and the defaults in ENDHDF2. The maximum radius is 2000 mm, and it consists of four wheels resting on the \(\eta=3.2\) line (four cylinders). No exact details of the material used as support between EM and HAD LAr calorimeters is present in this model. A copper cylinder is put on the back of the HAD calorimeter to ensure enough material in front of the muon chambers. 

#### 2.1.1 material distribution

Figure 9 shows the material distribution in front of the first and second active layer of the preshower, and in front of the active part of the end-cap EM calorimeter. In A this is done without tapering the Pb layer in front of the preshower. In B 2 \(X_{0}\) are forced in front of layer 1 and 3 \(X_{0}\) in front of layer 2. The tracking material is taken into account (see also Figure 8).

## 3 EM layout summary

Figure 11 shows the separate preshower layout as it is implemented in DICE and described in this document. The associated datacards are named ATL_TP0.

Figure 11: DICE layout for the separate preshower geometryFigure 12 shows a summary of the material distribution. The upstream material is not controlled between \(\eta\)=1.40 and \(\eta\)=1.55. In this region some optimization work is still required. The material contribution mainly comes from the cold wall of the cryostats and from the end flanges of the barrel cryostat.

### Calibration of the EM calorimeter

The calibration of the EM calorimeter for the version with separate preshower has been installed in the package ATRECON, namely in routines ECALCAL, ENDECAL, COPSCAL, COPECAL. The datacards to be used to activate this calibration (mode 2) are: DETA 'ECAL' 5=2 DETA 'COPS' 4=2

The detector has been calibrated with electrons of \(E_{T}\)=2,5,10,20,40,80 GeV. The overall calibration formula is:

\[E_{tot}=\gamma\times(\delta\times EM_{samp1}+EM_{samp2}+EM_{samp3}+\alpha \times(\beta\times PS1+PS2))\]

The same set of coefficients is used at all energies at a given rapidity.

The calibration formula given above can also be used for the integrated preshower case (with \(PS2\)=0 and \(PS1\)=presampler). The resulting coefficients are given below.

Hadronic Tile Calorimeter

The barrel and extended barrel Tile calorimeters are placed around the barrel and endcap cryostats. Three cylinders are positioned: a central barrel and two extended barrels, each one divided azimuthally into 64 sectors. Each sector consists of an active part (absorbers plus scintillator plates), a support part (girder) which also acts as return flux, a front plate and two end plates. In GEANT the barrel and extended barrels have exactly the same structure, but different longitudinal dimensions. The sector geometry is generated by a single routine (H8BAWED) in patch TILECAL of DICE. The Tilecal geometry is steered by routine H8BAGEO. A description of the code and of all parameters can be found in the TILECAL patch of file TILEDOC or in the DICE manual. The GEANT description is very accurate in all details and reflects the engineering design of the calorimeter. All detector parameters are stored in routine TILEDF1. The barrel cylinder is centred around 0., the extended barrels start at \(\pm\)3450 mm in z.

All parameters defining the geometry are defined and stored in the TILE DETG zebra bank. The list, the meaning and the default values of these parameters can be found below. At the hit level, all individual Tile hits are stored separately, allowing this way a further reorganization of the readout cells.

### General layout

The Integrated LAr Forward Calorimeter (IFC) is housed in the same cryostat as the end-cap calorimeters. It consists of three longitudinal segments. The active material (LAr) is placed in the absorber in the form of cylindrical tubes with their axes parallel to each other and the beam line. In the lateral cross section they are arranged in such a way, that each tube is at equal distance from its 6 neighbours (hexagonal pattern) with centre-to-centre distance of 7.50 mm. The outer tube radius is 2.50 mm, the inner one is 2.25 mm. The active material of the IFC is confined in the pseudorapidity range 3.17 - 4.87.

The calorimeter itself is preceded by excluder and polyethylene disks. The excluder is made of light material and serves to expel passive LAr in front of calorimeter. The poly disk is used to reduce neutron albedo in the inner detector. The last segment of the calorimeter is followed by a passive absorber which improves shielding of the 1-st forward muon superlayer. Though the support structure of the IFC is not yet designed, two aluminium support disks are placed in front of the 1st and 3rd segments. Certainly it is in no way sufficient and the proper support structure should be introduced as soon as it will be chosen.

The transition region between the IFC and the end-cap calorimeter is defined as

Figure 13: normalized response for 1 TeV jets as a function of \(\eta\). For comparison the normalized response over the full calorimetry system is shown (the statistical errors are much smaller than the point size).

Figure 14: energy and transverse energy resolution for 1 TeV jets as a function of \(\eta\) (when not visible, the error bars are slightely smaller than the point size).

follows: the EM end-cap and the 1st longitudinal segment of the HAD end-cap are projective along \(\eta=3.2\). The excluder and poly disk in front of the IFC are tapered correspondingly. The three last hadronic end-cap segments are cylindrical with stairs centered at \(\eta=3.2\). The corresponding three IFC segments follow this step structure. Thus the \(\eta\) region 3.17 - 3.26 is shared between the hadronic end-cap and the IFC calorimeter.

### Geometry and material definition

The IFC geometry in DICE is described in FWDCGE3 routine. Most of the geometrical defaults listed below are defined and stored in DETP bank in FWDCDF3 routine and are therefore accessible via datacards. Part of the parameters is calculated (e.g. Rmin of calorimeter segments, Rmax of excluder and poly block) in FWDCSE3 routine, which also stores all the parameters (both primary and derivative) in common block FWDPA3 for further usage in FWDGE3 and other routines.

Had 2 heavymet + LAr (act.) 5700 94 479

passive absorber heavymet (W+Ni+Cu) 6160 80 483

6350 80 483

All the gaps between calorimeter parts are filled by (inactive) LAr.

The IFC specific materials (excluder, brass and heavymet) are defined in FWDCGE3 routine (user material numbers 201, 202 and 203 respectively). Brass is defined as a mixture of copper and zinc (0.65 and 0.35 content by weight). Heavymet is composed of tungsten, nickel and copper (0.950, 0.035 and 0.015).

### \(\eta-\phi\) segmentation, HITs and DIGIts

Hitization of IFC calorimeter (FWDCST3 routine) is based on its simplified (all the cells are considered to be equal, \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.0982\)) \(\eta-\phi\) segmentation preserved in DETG bank. As an \(\eta-\phi\) position of the hit the centre of the corresponding \(\eta-\phi\) cell is assumed, as a Z-position the centre of the corresponding longitudinal segment is assumed.

Digitization (FWDCDI3 routine) is made in a standard way for \(\eta-\phi\) segmented calorimeters utilizing the CALODIG DICE routine.

No electronic noise or cell thresholds are yet introduced for IFC at DICE or ATRECON level.

More realistic segmentation, reflecting grouping of individual tubes into readout channels, should probably be implemented in the future.

### Datacard selections and calibration coefficients

To select IFC, 'GEOM' 3 for 'CENT', 'CRYO' and 'FWDC' itself must be selected in the corresponding "*MODE" cards. These selections are now defaults and are applied in atl_tpx.datacard.

Calibration coefficients for the IFC were derived from comparison of the response to electrons and pions (energy smeared between 200 - 400 GeV) hitting the IFC in the \(\eta\) window 3.6 - 4.2. The constants of 85.2, 185. and 185. were obtained for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd segment respectively. No attempt was made so far to finely tune the calibration allowing for different constants for the 2nd and 3rd segment.

The ATRECON jet reconstruction package includes now the IFC information in the common \(\eta-\phi\) matrix, thus the response to jets can be analyzed in the full ATLAS calorimetry coverage. The \(\eta\) dependent calibration for each segment of each hadron calorimeter (including IFC) can be easily introduced now through the ATRECON function HCALCLB. This function reads the DETC bank of the corresponding calorimeter (if present) and/or uses its own defaults. Since the DETC bank can be modified/created via datacard, one can correct the calibration constants of hadronic calorimeters without changing the code. Presently it contains as default \(\eta\)-independent constants for all hadronic calorimeters.

To activate the jet finder and insert the correct calibration for the IFC one should add the following datacards:

 (activate jet finder in ATRECON)

 *MODE 'HCAL' 'RECO' 1 (set energy calibration mode to 11, i.e. call HCALCLB)

 *DETA 'HCAL' 5=11.

 (enter correct calibration for IFC)

 *DETA 'FWDC' 11=85.2 21=185. 31=185.

#### 5.4.1 IFC performance: Monte Carlo results

Using DICE version 2.03 the performance of the IFC was studied.

The single particle resolution (particles distributed randomly in \(\eta\) from 3.6 to 4.2) was found to be

for pions:

\[\frac{r.m.s.}{E}=\frac{0.32\pm 0.04}{\sqrt{E}}+(0.029\pm 0.005)\]

for electrons:

\[\frac{r.m.s.}{E}=\frac{0.22\pm 0.04}{\sqrt{E}}+(0.040\pm 0.005)\]

The important feature of the forward region is the capability of reconstructing high energy jets. To evaluate the response for jets (especially in the end-cap/forward transition region and at the boundary of the effective pseudorapidity coverage, beyond \(\eta\)= 4) small samples of 1 TeV di-jet events at various \(\eta\) were generated. Standard ATL-SJTP0.DATACARDS were used. For GEANT simulation, only particles inside an \(\eta-\phi\) cone of size 0.7 around the jet direction were retained. The jet direction was found by means of LUCELL routine. The energy of muons and neutrinos was not included in the energy of the generated jet.

To find the jet in the calorimeter the standard ATRECON jet reconstruction package was used. The only modification was introduced to take into account the fact that for high pseudorapidities the size of the hadronic shower becomes comparable to the \(\eta-\phi\) cone size used to find the jet and sum up its energy.

The very preliminary results of these simulations are shown in Figure 13 and 14. It should be noted that the algorithm of jet reconstruction is not yet optimal for the very forward region and requires some further tuning. Furthermore a more complicated \(\eta\) dependent calibration of the calorimeters could also improve the resolution.

MC simulation

Several tapes of electrons, photons and pions have been generated at CERN. For this generation the GEANT321 version has been used, as well as DICE 2.04. The list of tapes generated is available on WWW or on VM in the file PROD TAPES on the Group disk (G). A subsection of this file is attached to this note. It contains the most relevant tapes used to optimize the calorimeters.

For all these tapes the information about decays in the tracker is also stored in the KINE bank. An example on how to analyze back these tapes can be found in the Atlas software manuals. All relevant algorithms are part of the ATRECON library.
