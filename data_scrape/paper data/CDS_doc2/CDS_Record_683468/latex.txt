In this document we present a new approach to the construction and assembly of a TILECAL module. The basic idea is to assemble 6 m long modules from initial 1 m long submodules in which the plates are glued one to each other. Engineering calculations, tools design and assembly procedure are described in detail herein.

Introduction

The standard Tilecal design forsees the construction of 64 modules of about 5900 mm length for the barrel calorimeter and 128 modules of about 2650 mm length for the extended barrel part.

A barrel module consists of 325 basic periods of 18 mm thickness (spacer layer-master-spacer layer-master), compressed into a stack imbetween a 20 mm thick front plate and a 20 mm thick end plate. The question arises about the way to compress the stack and pile up 6000 mm of laminated iron plates.

On top of the original scheme to use rods through the whole lenght for compression, two different approaches have been proposed by our Protvino and Argonne colleagues. There the idea is to assembly the final 6 m using precompressed 1 m long submodules. After initial doubts and the advice of magnet specialists who are used to similar problems we have agreed upon the advantages of such a solution and we have tried to develop a different approach wich should offer the advantages of both methods.

As input parameters we have used the specifications for the steel procurement of the TILECAL note 12 and the official dimensions for master, spacers and support structure.

For the design we require that the final gap between modules will not exceed 0.5 mm at any place.

We also require the presence of calibration tubes, like in the test beam modules, that cross each scintillator, and the possibility to insert scintillator tiles at any moment after the mechanical assembly.

Assembly procedure

All assembly operations can be summarized in 4 steps:

* Construction of 250 mm high premodules by glueing and compressing all interfaces between master and spacer plates.
* Assembly of this premodules into 1 m long submodules. Additional fixation is obtained using 3 welded external iron straps.
* Assembly of the 1m long submodules into a 6 m long final module. As structural element both side plates, the front plate and a 50 mm thick support plate are welded to the stack. Longitudinal rods and calibration tubes are introduced into the stack at that moment.
* Final assembly of the module with his double I support structure. Insertion of scintillators, drawer system and fibers.

### The 250 mm thick premodules

The 250 mm thick premodule assembly will be realized by compressing in a pressing tool (see Figure 1 and 2 ) preassembled half periods ( 28 times ).

First half periods are assembled using elastic dowels, like it has been done in the first prototype construction. Each elastic pin will not extend outside an half period (8.5 mm long pins). In this way all spacer plates will be perfectly aligned on the masters. A layer of epoxy glue is applied on the spacer to master contact face. To avoid that the epoxy is squeezed by compression outside the contact surface, the glue will be applied up to 1 to 2 cm from each edge. The glue has the role of keeping the stack compact and at the same time of compensating for surface planarity defects. In this way the stack will be kept perfectly parallel. Tipically on each contact phase the amount of glue will be of the order of 0.010 mm.

Each premodule is assembled in a dedicated pressing tool. Details of the pressing tool are shown in Figure 1,2,3 and 4. This consists of a base with well machined surface (REP 1) to get good planarity and of two poles (REP 2 and 3) used as reference plane for front and side face. The pressure will be applied via a 3 cm thick plate (REP 6), using a screw system (REP 4,7) of at least 6 screws. The pressure transferred can be of 20-30 tons distributed uniformly and will be kept in place during the polymerization. At least 4 such tools have to operate in parallel (4 premodules per day) The glue polymerizes typically within 24 hours. The time needed is at least 1 week for 6 1 m long submodules, using 3 crews of 3 people. Construction of all barrel premodules will then take 64 weeks.

Three out of 4 premodules will be made of 14 periods. The 4th one will be shorter and consists of 12 periods. Assuming that due to the initial 75 \(\mu\) thickness tolerance, masters and spacers will be sorted out into 2 families, the total thickness dispersion of all premodules should be kept at the level of less than 0.3 mm (assuming a gaussian thickness distribution). Part or most of this thickness dispersion can be compensatedby the glue. Each stack will be measured in this phase. Glueing tests and R&D will be performed at CERN in july. Each stack will be measured in this phase.

The planarity of the \(\phi\) crack surfaces will be controlled on one side with the 2 reference planes, while on the opposite face the planarity is determined by the the cutting tolerances (each half period is positioned independently). Tolerances of the order of 0.1 mm will result in a 0.2 mm surface irregularity wich will allow to keep the cracks between modules below the design goal of 0.5 mm over the full lenght of 6 m.

The total weight of 1 premodule will be about 750 Kg. Particular handling tools have to be developped for such premodules.

### The 1000 mm thick submodule

Four premodules will then be used to assemble a 1 m long submodule, using a pressing and assembly tool similar to the one used in the preceeding phase, but capable to press a 1 m long stacks (Figure 3 and 4). The 4 premodules will again be glued together. At this point eventual thickness correction can be applied.

Once the stack is compressed and the glue is polymerized, 2 metal bars of 10 mm thickness and 80 mm width are welded to the external (REP B and C of Figure 4) face. Similarly a 60 mm wide and 10 mm thick metal strap is welded across the center of the inner (small radius) face (REP A). This will add strength and safety to the compression and will allow further manipulations of the submodule. A crew of 2 people will be dedicated to this operation. Assuming a thickness tolerance of 0.3 mm for the 250 mm premodules, 0.6 mm tolerances should be obtained for the 1 m stack. Stack planarity can be very good and will be kept below 0.5 mm

At the end of the stacking operation and polymerization eventual traces of glue at the position of the scintillator will be removed mechanically using a dedicated tool. Tests of scintillator insertion will also be made systematically.

Each submodule will then be measured, catalogued and prepared for short term storage and eventual transportation.

The mechanical rigidity of such an object has been simulated (see FEA section). No particular problems where anticipated.

### Assembly of the 6 m long module

The submodules will then be layed down horizontally on the 6 m assembly tool (Figure 5 to 10). This consists of a chassis on which the modules are layed down (reference plane REP 9 Figure 5), with on one side two mechanical stops and references (REP 11). After two submodules have been glued together (Figure 6), they will be put under compression using a pressing system (REP 12). The quality of the lower \(\phi\) crack plane will be kept optimal because of the reference system. The quality of the upper one will depend on the planary obtained in the submodule assembly phase and on the cutting tolerances. Possible adjustements between submodules to reach the design module lenght can be applied at this moment. Rods and calibration tubes will then be inserted. Once the 6 m stack is compressed via the press mechanism and the rods, and the glue is polymerized,2 additional iron bars (10 mm tick, 60 mm wide and 5900 mm long) will be welded at the small radius surface (Figure 8 REP D).

At large radius a 45 mm thick and 5900 mm long support plate will be welded (Figure 9 REP 9). A particular ajustement and fixation tool is forseen (see Figure 9 REP 10) to allow easy and effective fixation starting from the top of the module.

These three long welded plates will further improved and assure the stack compression and will allow save manipualtion of the 18 tons module (special tools have to be developpedfor that).

Each submodule will at this point be ready for medium term storage and transportation.

### FEA results

Ii it the object of this Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to determine the behaviour of the solution described in this document.

The simulation model describes a 6 m module formed by one meter submodules. Every submodule is composed by masters and spacers glued together. These packets are supported by a 45 mm thick steel plate. First we have calculated the forces between masters and spacers, the force supported by the glue, and in function of these results the behaviour of the 6 meter module has been calculated, where the submodules are considered to be homogeneous and with steel properties.

#### 2.4.1 Model Definition

The 1 meter module has been simulated with the following assumptions:

* Masters and spacers have been simulated with shell elements.
* The support bars have been simulated with three dimensional solid elements.
* The glue has been simulated using contact interface elements in parallel with spring elements.
* Then with two symmetry planes, only a quarter of the modules has been described.
* Only the forces are expected to be correct not the deformations.

The 6 meter long module has been simulated under the following assumptions:

* The joint between packets is perfect.
* The submodules behaviour is homogeneous with the equivalent density of steel and scintillators.
* Forces and deformations are expected to be correct.

#### 2.4.2 Load case definition

In all the cases the load is the gravity, the difference between cases is the module position in space.

* Case 1. 1 m module positioned at 6 o'clock. Boundary conditions: displacements restricted in the three directions to a zone of 20 mm in the end's module.
* Case 2. 6 m module positioned at 6 o'clock. Boundary conditions: simulation of joints between adjacents modules.
* Case 3. 6 m module positioned at 9 o'clock. Boundary conditions: simulation of joints between adjacents modules.

#### 2.4.3 Results

* Case 1. The maximum stress for the glue is 0.168 MPa, this stress is perfectly admissible. We can assume that the submodule works like one piece with steel characteristics.
* Case 2. The maximum stress is (von Misses)= 1.8 Mpa. Maximum deformation = 1 \(\mu\)m. Stress and deformation are perfectly admissible.
* Case 3. The maximum stress (von Misses) = 0.6 Mpa The maximum stress (shear) = 0.1 MPa The maximum deformation = 22 \(\mu\)m

Stress and deformation are all acceptable.

### Final assembly of a 6m module

In the end phase the double I beams are monuted on the 45 mm plate using screws.

The scintillator tiles are inserted by removing the rods and tubes involved for each size.

Fibers are inserted in the scintillators and then routed to the PM location. Once a boundle is formed, it will be glued and polished in place (using a particular diamond polishing tool).

A test drawer is then inserted and aligned inside the support structure and a first source debugging QC is performed to spot eventual assembly problems of the optical elements.

After all this the module is ready for the final drawer insertion and calibration.
