## 1 Introduction

Detailed calculation of the production and diffusion of neutrons, photons and charged particles has been recently presented in several workshops of the muon group of the ATLAS Collaboration. This flux is expected to be high and to be the most important source of background for muon chambers. The muon detector counting rates are expected to be considerably high.

In this condition the level-1 muon trigger system must deal with this noisy environment and therefore it should be designed to ensure a robust track identification

## 2 Background particle fluxes in the experimental hall

The evaluation of the neutral and charged particle background fluxes in the Atlas hall is very important for designing a safe level-1 muon trigger system.

These are the main sources of background particles:

* neutrons, photons, muons and charged hadrons produced by hadron interactions at large \(\eta\) with the beam pipe wall, the very forward calorimeters, the collimators and the quadrupoles [1]. Without any shielding the expected fluxes for neutrons/photons and muons are so large (\(\approx 10^{6}\) Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) and several \(10^{2}\) Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) respectively) to make impossible the experiment. With a plausible shielding the particle background flux is reduced by about a factor 100. Accounting for a typical neutron and photon sensitivity of the muon detectors considered in ATLAS (0.001 and 0.01 respectevely), the background counting rate is predicted to be up to 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) in the region \(\eta\leq 1.5\), up to 200 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) in the region \(1.5\leq\eta\leq 2.3\) and \(\approx 500\) Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) for \(\eta\) close to 3. Muon rates are of the order of a few Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) on the barrel and a few tens of Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) in the forward region; hadron rates are about 10 times higher than the muon ones.
* muons and hadrons due to the beam halo. This background is similar to the previous one but, its absolute level is not very well known yet. It's mainly related to the probability of beam iteractions with the beam pipe. Machine design constraints are such that a high beam halo would prevent the normal LHC operation [2]. For this reason the level of this background should be negligible with the respect to the one discussed before.

* muons produced by pion and kaon decays in the central cavity. The level of this background has been calculated by several authors; at the design luminosity \(L=1.7\times 10^{34}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) an (almost) uniform rate of 0.2 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) is expected in the barrel, whereas the rate depends on \(\eta\) in the forward regions. The rate reaches the value of 70 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) at \(\eta=2\)[3].
* muons and hadrons produced by the hadron punchthrough in the central calorimeters. The rate is lower than the previous one: 0.02 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) in the barrel and 0.2 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) at \(\eta\)=2 [3].
* cosmic rays. This source of background has not studied in detail yet. From a simple analytical calculation we expect in the barrel a rate of a few \(10^{-3}\) Hz/cm\({}^{2}\).

## 3 Accidental trigger rates

In this chapter we calculate the random trigger rate in the barrel muon system as a function of the background particle rate hitting the detector. In what follows, the noise seen in a point of the muon system is assumed to be fully uncorrelated with the noise seen in any other point. Later in this paper possible effects of noise correlations will be considered.

Let's consider now the simplest trigger scheme, based on two planes of strip detectors (see fig. 1). The trigger is satisfied by any coincidence of a strip of plane 1 with a set of adjacent strips of plane 2. Studies of this algorithm have been presented in [4].

If the strip surface is \(S\), the probability \(P_{trig}(S,\Delta t)\) that a given strip in plane 1 gives accidental trigger is

\[P_{trig}(S,\Delta t)=P_{1}(S,\Delta t)\times P_{2}(S_{bend},\Delta t)\]

where

\[P_{1}(S,\Delta t)=r_{1}S\Delta t\] \[P_{2}(S_{bend},\Delta t)=r_{2}S_{bend}\Delta t\]

\(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\) are the background fluxes on plane 1 and 2 respectevely; \(\Delta t\) is the time coincidence between the two random hits, whereas \(S_{bend}\) is the coincidence surface on the bending projection with the fired strip of plane 1. The choice of \(S_{bend}\) determines the transverse momentum cut. Let's assume \(r_{1}=r_{2}=r\). Consequently,

\[P_{trig}(S,\Delta t)=r^{2}SS_{bend}(\Delta t)^{2}\]

By integrating over the full number of strips of station 1 covering the barrel and dividing by \(\Delta t\), the trigger rate \(Tr\) results:

\[Tr=r^{2}S_{barrel}S_{bend}\Delta t\]

Now,* \(S_{barrel}(Radius=7.5~{}m)=1.2\times 10^{7}\) cm\({}^{2}\)
* \(S_{bend}(Radius=10.0~{}m,p_{T}^{th.}=20~{}GeV/c)=40\times 215~{}cm^{2}=8600\) cm\({}^{2}\)
* concerning \(\Delta t\) let's assume \(\Delta t\)=20 ns.

In this situation it turns out that

\[Tr=2.1\cdot 10^{3}\times r^{2}~{}Hz\]

r (background flux) [Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)] Tr (acc. trigger rate) [Hz]

1 2.1 \(\cdot 10^{3}\)

10 2.1 \(\cdot 10^{5}\)

100 2.1 \(\cdot 10^{7}\)

These rates should be compared with the beauty trigger rate of about 4 kHz (in the barrel; muon p\({}_{T}>20\) GeV/c) at the luminosity \(L=1.7\times 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

This situation is unacceptable: more trigger planes have to be added to strongly reduce this large accidental trigger rate.

It can be shown that, in general, for \(n\) planes in coincidence still assembled in two stations, the accidental trigger rate is

\[Tr=k\cdot r^{n}S_{barrel}S_{bend}(\prod_{i=1,n-2}S_{i})~{}(\Delta t)^{n-1}\]

where k (k\(\geq 1\)) is a constant scheme dependent and the various \(S_{i}\) are the additional coincidence surfaces. Assuming that \(S_{1}=S_{2}=\cdot~{}\cdot~{}\cdot=S_{n-2}=S_{c}\) the formula simplifies in

\[Tr=k\cdot r^{n}S_{barrel}S_{bend}S_{c}^{n-2}(\Delta t)^{n-1}=\] \[=k\cdot r^{2}S_{barrel}S_{bend}\Delta t~{}~{}\times~{}~{}[rS_{c} \Delta t]^{n-2}\]

Neglecting the k-constant, the left-side of the formula is just the contribution of a two-planes trigger as seen before, while the reduction to it is given by the term \([rS_{c}\Delta t]^{n-2}=O_{c}^{n-2}\) appearing in the right-side of the formula. It is worth to notice that the term \(O_{c}=rS_{c}\Delta t\) is simply the occupancy of the coincidence surface \(S_{c}\) at the noise rate \(r\).

The reduction is obtained only if \(O_{c}^{n-2}~{}<~{}1\): this implies \(O_{c}~{}<~{}1\). However, any effective system must have the occupancy \(O_{c}~{}\ll~{}1\). This implies:

1. very small coincidence surfaces
2. very small time coincidence gate

Otherwise, if 0.1\(<O_{c}<\)1, \(n\) must be very large, with the consequence that trigger systems with many layers in coincidence are very sensitive to noise uncertainties:

\[if~{}~{}~{}r\rightarrow\alpha r~{}~{}~{}~{}then~{}~{}~{}~{}Tr\rightarrow \alpha^{n}\times Tr\]

## 4 Dedicated muon trigger systems

We have seen that a robust trigger system capable to operate in a large particle flux environment should have very small occupancy, i.e. small coincidence surfaces and very small time coincidence among different chamber planes used for triggering. In addition to this, the muon trigger system in ATLAS is supposed to identify the bunch crossing also [5]; this additional requirement to the system endorses the preference for a fast detector (for example see [6]), for which this performance is natural if the time resolution \(\delta t\) is \(\delta t<5\) ns.

Drift chambers, used for the precise measurement, don't match well the above requirements and therefore cannot be simply used in a fast system. The fast chambers would be an additional detector in the muon spectrometer.

Even with a very fast trigger system we have to consider the coincidence of several trigger detectors to strongly reduce the trigger rate due to uncorrelated background. In particular an additional trigger system that operates in the non bending projection (plane R-\(\phi\)) can be a very effective way to suppress the accidental trigger rate [7]. From this additional system one could also easily derive the second coordinate with the accuracy that is required for a precise standalone muon momentum measurement (\(\sigma_{R\phi}\approx 1\) cm)[8].

However, additional cost and the effect of additional material on the final momentum resolution of the muon spectrometer should be taken into account (the maximum amount of extra material allowed in the sagitta station should be \(\approx 0.1\) X\({}_{\rm s}\)).

### The trigger tower geometry

Fig. 2 shows the trigger tower geometry considered for this study (the spectrometer assumed here is a 10-coils system, i.e. 30 trigger subsectors (R-\(\phi\) sector devided in three subsectors; the results found apply also for a 8-coils system, taking into account that in this case the sector would be devided in four subsectors: in total we would have 32 subsectors ). The dimensions correspond to the modularity of the coil structure along the beam direction (2.4 m) and by the positions of station 1 (sagitta station, radius R=7.5 m) and station 2 (outer station, radius R=10.0 m). The detector considered is a strip detector with stripsize \(W_{\rm c}\) = 3 cm. The strip run parallel and orthogonal to the beam line, in order to provide an indipendent trigger in the bending projection (R-\(\varepsilon\)) and in the non bending one (R-\(\phi\)). The trigger window in the bending projection has been fixed to \(W_{\rm bend}\) = 40 cm (actually it his \(\eta\) dependent, ranging from 27 cm at \(\eta\) = 0 to \(\sim\) 60 cm at the end of he barrel) corresponding to a \(p_{T}^{th}\) = 20 GeV/c. The trigger window in the transverse plane has been fixed to \(W_{\phi}\) = 10 cm, well adequate for selecting with very high efficiency muons with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV/c. The time gate coincidence is \(\Delta t=20\) ns, unless otherwise specified.

The occupancy of a generic strip is less than 0.004 at \(r\) = 300 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). In the same condition the occupancy of a drift wire tube with 3 cm diameter and 600 cm long is 0.16.

### Trigger rate from uncorrelated background

In this section we present trigger rates as a function of the background flux assuming a completely uncorrelated background. In the next one, instead, we present trigger rates due to correlated background. For both sections two possible schemes have been considered.

#### 4.2.1 Scheme 1

In the first example each trigger station is made by three layers of detector planes (see fig. 3); each detector is equipped with two strip layers, one providing the coordinate in the bending projection and one for the trigger in the other projection. In total we have 3+3 measurement planes for the R-z coordinate and 3+3 for the R-\(\phi\) coordinate, for a 6-layer trigger system.

The trigger logic requires a (2/3) majority per station per projection.

The number of possible configurations is k=3\(\times\)3=9. The accidental trigger rates of this scheme results to be

\[Tr=9\cdot r^{4}S_{barrel}S_{bend}S_{e-z}S_{e-\phi}(\Delta t)^{3} \times(W_{\phi}/1.3L_{\phi})(W_{c}/L_{*})(W_{c}/L_{\phi})\] \[=9\cdot r^{4}S_{barrel}W_{bend}W_{\phi}W_{c}^{4}(\Delta t)^{3}=r^{4 }\times 2.8\cdot 10^{-11}\ Hz\]

r (noise rate) [Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)] Tr (acc. trigger rate) [Hz]

100 \(\approx 0\)

300 0.2

500 2

700 7

1000 30

It is possible to see that with this approach there are not problems for background rates even beyond 1 kHz/cm\({}^{2}\).

The trigger efficiency \(\epsilon_{trig}\) as a function of \(\epsilon_{1}\) is \(\epsilon_{trig}=(\epsilon_{2/3})^{2}\) where \(\epsilon_{2/3}=3\epsilon_{1}^{2}(1-\epsilon_{1})+\epsilon_{1}^{3}\).

\(\epsilon_{1}\)

0.97

0.95

0.93

0.90

This scheme implies a global detector surface of 9000 m\({}^{2}\) and 3\(\times 10^{5}\) electronic channels (barrel

#### 4.2.2 Scheme 2

Let's consider now the scheme in fig. 4. The two stations are made by 4 chamber planes each, two providing only the R-z coordinate and two only the R-\(\phi\) coordinate. In total we have 2+2=4 planes in the bending projection and 2+2=4 planes in the transverse projection. The trigger is satisfied by a (3/4) majority in the bending projection and a (3/4) majority in the transverse one. The number of possible configuration accepted by this requirement gives the k-constant of the formulae in section 3; for this particular scheme k=4\(\times\)4=16. The accidental trigger rate is

\[Tr=16\cdot r^{6}S_{barrel}S_{bend}S_{e-\phi}S_{ tower}S_{\phi}S_{e-z}(\Delta t)^{5}=\] \[=16\cdot r^{6}S_{barrel}1.3^{2}1.16^{2}W_{bend}W_{\phi}W_{c}^{2}L_ {\phi}^{3}L_{z}^{3}(\Delta t)^{5}\] \[Tr=r^{6}\times 3.1\cdot 10^{-13}\ Hz\]In the next table the random trigger rates given by this scheme is given as a function of the background rate

r (noise rate) [Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)] Tr (acc. trigger rate) [Hz]

50 \(\approx\) 0

100 0.3

300 230

500 \(\quad\) 4.9\(\times 10^{3}\)

As we can see this scheme can be employed succesfully in environment with background counting rate up to 300 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\).

The overall trigger efficiency \(\epsilon_{trig}\) as a function of the single detector plane efficiency \(\epsilon_{1}\) is \(\epsilon_{trig}=(\epsilon_{3/4})^{2}\) where \(\epsilon_{3/4}=4\epsilon_{1}^{3}(1-\epsilon_{1})+\epsilon_{1}^{4}\). The result of this calculation is presented in the following table.

\(\epsilon_{1}\)\(\epsilon_{trig}\)

0.98 0.995

0.95 0.972

0.90 0.898

Good trigger efficiency can be obtained with detector efficiency above 0.95.

This scheme implies a global detector surface of 12000 m\({}^{2}\) and 2\(\times 10^{5}\) electronic channels (barrel only).

### Trigger rates from correlated background

So far, the particle background flux has been assumed to produce noise hits completely uncorrelated. Actually it must be considered the effects also of the same particle background that produces hits in 2 or more detector planes.

Muons (and charged hadrons, mainly pions), even at low momentum, can satisfy easily the trigger logic in one of the two trigger stations, particularly if the detector planes in the trigger stations are very close by. In this condition the coincidence of the muon detected in one of the two stations with either neutron/photon hits or with another muon could satisfy the trigger conditions with large rate.

In addition to muons, also electrons with kinetic energy above \(\approx\) 500 KeV can cross the detector walls and other materials that separate the independent detector planes, producing hits in the trigger station. The probability that this happens depends strongly on the particular detector design (geometry, magnetic field intensity and material arounds the sensitive volumes of the chamber): study on this topic are still in progress.

However, the additional requirement for each trigger station that the local hit pattern defines a track pointing back to the interaction region should strongly reduce the trigger rate due the uncorrelated background. A carefull and detailed study of this problem is needed.

In the following two subsections we consider the trigger rate due to the coincidence of a muon (or any charged particle) hit pattern in one of the two stations with hits induced by uncorrelated background particles or by another muon (or any charged particle) in the other station.

#### 4.3.1 Scheme 1

In this case we benefit of the _local_ tracking property of this scheme since the three-layer structure of each station for the two independent projections.

The accidental trigger rate from muon-neutron/photon coincidence is

\[Tr=6\cdot r^{2}r_{\mu}S_{barrel}S_{bend}S_{c}(W_{\phi}/1.3L_{\phi})(W _{e}/1.3L_{\phi})(\Delta t)^{2}=\] \[=6\cdot r^{2}r_{\mu}S_{barrel}W_{bend}W_{\phi}W_{c}^{2}(\Delta t)^ {2}=r^{2}r_{\mu}\times 1\times 10^{-4}\ Hz\]

where r\({}_{\mu}\) is the rate of pointing muons that should be not confused with the muon rate integrated on all possible flight directions (that is the only one studied, so far).

By fixing the muon rate to 1 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) we obtain:

r (noise rate) [Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)] Tr (acc. trigger rate) [Hz]

100 1 300 9 500 26 700 49 1000 100

For this scheme, even if the muon-neutron/photon accidental trigger rate is larger than the one due to pure uncorrelated noise, the trigger rate is still very low up to 1 kHz/cm\({}^{2}\) noise rate. This still holds even for larger muon (or any other charged particle) flux rate.

In case of a muon-muon coincidence the scheme is reduced to a simple two-plane algorithm. The accidental trigger rate is then

\[Tr=r_{\mu}^{2}S_{barrel}S_{bend}(W_{\phi}/1.3L_{\phi})(\Delta t)=\] \[=r_{\mu}^{2}S_{barrel}W_{bend}W_{\phi}(\Delta t)=r_{\mu}^{2}\times 9 6\ Hz\]

r\({}_{\mu}\) (muon back. rate) [Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)] Tr (acc. trigger rate) [Hz]

0.1 100 1 5 \(2.4\times 10^{3}\)

10 \(9.6\times 10^{3}\)

From this table we see that the muon-muon coincidence (or more generally track-track coincidence) can give fake trigger with large rates if the single muon (charged particle) rate \(r_{\mu}\) producing local coincidences is above a few Hz/cm\({}^{2}\).

#### 4.3.2 Scheme 2

Let's suppose that the muon hits the station 1. Thus, assuming efficiency \(\approx 1\), 2 hits in coincidence in the bending projection and 2 in the transverse one are produced. To satisfy the trigger condition, only 1 hit in the bending projection and 1 in the non bending one are needed. If these hits are produced by neutron/photon background then the trigger rate would be (accounting also for muon hitting station 2 and neutron/photon hitting station 1):

\[Tr=4\cdot r^{2}r_{\mu}S_{barrel}S_{barrel}S_{barrel}(\Delta t)^{2} + 4\cdot r^{2}r_{\mu}S_{barrel}S_{barrel}S_{barrel}(W_{\phi}/1.3L_{\phi}(\Delta t)^{ 2}=\] \[=4\cdot(1.3^{2}+1)r^{2}r_{\mu}S_{barrel}W_{barrel}W_{barrel}L_{\phi} L_{z}(\Delta t)^{2}=r^{2}r_{\mu}\times 0.818\ Hz\]

The constant 4 represents the number of possible configurations.

By fixing the muon rate to 1 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) we obtain

r (noise rate) [Hz/cm\({}^{2}\)] Tr (acc. trigger rate) [Hz]

50 \(2.1\times 10^{3}\)

100 \(8.1\times 10^{3}\)

300 \(7.3\times 10^{4}\)

500 \(2.1\times 10^{5}\)

As it is possible to see, this rate dominates largely the one due to pure uncorrelated background. In addition already with a background of 50 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) we have a trigger rate comparable with the one from beauty. Therefore this scheme seems to be not not well adequate for triggering in large background environment.

The case of muon-muon coincidence rate is equivalent to the previous scheme.

## 5 Conclusions

Muon systems at the LHC will be exposed to large background flux. This is particularly important for open muon systems as the Atlas aircore toroid. Muon detector counting rate of the order of 100 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) are expected when the forward devices present in the experimental hall are very well shielded. Furthermore, we have to take into account that a realistic shielding could easily give larger background fluxes.

As a consequence the level-1 muon trigger must be protected against this huge background that would induce large trigger rate.

The trigger detector should be then preferrably fast and highly segmented in order to reduce the occupancy of the elementary trigger surface to a very low level. Moreover, the trigger algorithm should be based on measurement redundancy; individual detectors should provide two independent coordinates, allowing to trigger independently in the bending and non-bending projection. In this way, as it has been shown in this note, trigger rate from uncorrelated background can be made negligible with the respect to the signal rate.

Concerning the correlated background, the effects from genuine muon, pion and electron coincidences need more studies. However it seems plausible that the additional requirement on the track segment detected locally in each trigger station pointing back to the interactionregion reduces the trigger rate to acceptable values. Any other effect due to correlated background can be kept at very low level.
