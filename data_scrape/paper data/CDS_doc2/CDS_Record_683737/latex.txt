On Gluing Tubes into Multilayers

Conventional Approach

In the past we have considered applying epoxy beads on the open surface of a tube layer fixed by bottom assemble combs. The glue lines can be placed either along the tube length or perpendicular to the tubes. Another layer of tubes is placed above the glue lines. Once the last layer of tubes is in place, top combs are placed above the multilayer until the epoxy is cured.

This approach has some obvious disadvantages.

1. The worklife of epoxy, for example the 3M DP serial structural epoxy, has worklife no more than 90 minutes. There will be serious consequences if any unexpected problems occur during the gluing process.
2. Because the bottom surfaces of tubes are not easily reachable, glue lines must be placed from above. The resulting configuration of glue joints is thus asymmetric. Internal stresses could potentially cause a multilayer to bend slightly.
3. Epoxy dispensing machines are expected to be large and expensive because the epoxy must be place precisely and quickly over an area of 3m x 6m.

New Approach

Tubes are placed in the assembly jig layer by layer forming a multilayer without any epoxy. Epoxy is placed into the triangle shaped holes at the joints of every three tubes. This is accomplished by an epoxy dispensing head which conforms the shape of the opening at the intersection of three tubes. The epoxy is pumped to the dispensing head through a piece of tubing. There are three small holes on the glue dispensing head to allow the glue to enter the three corners of the triangle.

All potential problems mentioned above are automatically solved:

1. The rate of placing tubes in the jig will not be forced by the worklife of the epoxy. The gluing process can be stopped and resumed when necessary. The multilayer which is held in the assemble jig without any epoxy can first be carefully checked to ensure every thing is in order. The epoxy enters the wedge shaped areas where adjacent tubes make contact only after the tubes are correctly located. Thus, the epoxy does not interfere with the tube placement process.
2. The glue line configuration is completely symmetric.
3. The epoxy dispensing system is simple, inexpensive and easy to handle. It does not interfere with the assembly jig. Epoxy can be placed only at desired locations. The amount of glue applied can be minimized because the glue is delivered precisely to where it should be. Discontinuous glue lines, if desired, can be easily realized.

## Tests and Discussions

The key of this approach is how fast the epoxy can flow in a small diameter tube. The glue flow speed is determined by four factors:

1. Maximum ID of the glue transporting tube (~4 mm).
2. Flow properties of the mixed epoxy inside such a tube.
3. The applied pressure.
4. Length of the tubing. Assuming we start gluing the 6 meter long module from its middle, the maximum length of the glue transporting tube is ~3 meters.

In our tests, we first tried 3M DP-460 epoxy which we have been using for some time. We use the standard 400 ml cartridge and glue gun with a mixing nozzle. The air pressure for powering the glue gun is ~7 atm (100 PSI). A specially made triangle shaped glue dispensing head is attached to a short piece of copper tube (OD = 4.0 mm, ID = 3.3 mm). The mixed epoxy flows out easily and the resulting three glue lines are uniform and fill the three corners nicely as shown in figure 1. We successfully used this system to glue a module with 21 tubes 80 cm long. The length of the copper tube is 90 cm. The results were very satisfactory. This process is shown in figures 2, 3 and 4.

We also tried a piece of long nylon tubing (ID = 3.5 mm). Immediately outside of the dispensing nozzle, the mixed DP-460 epoxy flows at a speed of ~4 cm/sec and it reduced to ~0.4 cm/sec at the end of the 3 meters tubing. This translates to ~1-2 cm/sec pulling speed for sufficient size glue beads. The flow speed became extremely slow when the tubing approaches 6 meters. Nonetheless, the DP-460 epoxy did reach the end of a 6.5 m long nylon tubing and emerged from the three holes after one hour.

We can estimate the time it takes to complete the gluing of a multilayer using this method. For example, to glue a multilayer with 1200 meters of tubes, the glue dispensing head must travel 1600 meters. By using a single glue dispensing head at the pulling speed 2 cm/s, the total time for gluing a multilayer is ~22 hours. We want to reduce this time by a factor of 5-10. In order to achieve this with DP-460 epoxy, we may consider the following straightforward approaches:

* We can use thin wall metal tube to maximize the tube ID.
* We can design a special pumping station and use a metal tube to increase the pressure.
* We can use a multi-head dispensing system.

Using epoxy with lower viscosity can increase the glue flow speed. Three types of epoxy in the 3M product line can be considered in our application. Their general properties are summarized below:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \multicolumn{6}{c}{Summary of epoxy properties} \\ \hline Epoxy & Viscosity & Worklife & Average T-peel & Overlap sheer strength \\  & (CPS) & (minutes) & (PIW) & (PSI) \\ \hline
3M DP-460 & 45,000 & 60 & 60 & 4,500 \\ \hline
3M DP-125 & 15,000 & 25 & 35 & 2,500 \\ \hline
3M DP-190 & 10,000 & 90 & 30 & 1,700 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The DP-190 epoxy was tried with a manual glue gun. The pressure applied to the mixed epoxy in the nylon tubing is not very high. However, the mixed glue which is like light motor oil flows much faster than the DP-460. Bonds between two tubes made with DP-190 is impossible to break without damaging the tubes. The DP-125, on the other hand, did not perform well. The flow is much more difficult than the DP-190 and the bonding is weak. The choice of adhesives for both the tubes and for the structural spacers is a very important issue. We plan to do more tests on DP-460, DP-190 and other adhesives. We also will discuss our problem with the 3M and other adhesive manufacturers.

The design of the epoxy dispensing head needs to be optimized once the type of epoxy and the amount required at each joint are known. Currently the dispensing head is machined into shape from brass (see figure 5). For the final use, it can be made from plastic either by machining or by injection molding. It is estimated that a dispensing head can be made by using a CNC lathe in several minutes. The injection molding approach may be more cost effective if large quantities are needed. In principle, this dispensing head is reusable if cleaned after each use. But it should be cheap enough to be disposed together with the plastic tube and epoxy mixing nozzle once a multilayer is completed.
