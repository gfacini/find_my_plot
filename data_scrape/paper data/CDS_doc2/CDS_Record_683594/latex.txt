**1. Summary of the method**

Note 115 reports on a method to estimate the 480 nm quantum efficiency of the 65 PMT's used for Module 0, using only the main PMT's characteristics, the "white" luminous photocathode sensitivity, the "blue" luminous photocathode sensitivity, together with standard definitions of photometric and radiometric quantities, and a typical shape of the R5900 relative radiant spectral sensitivity. The method had been first tested on two PMT for which the full spectral characteristics were available. One of these PMT's corresponds to a "typical" R5900, and the other to a non "typical" one in point of view of its characteristics. The method had been then applied to the set of 65 PMT's used in Module 0. As a final result, we estimate that the 480 nm quantum efficiency was on the average of,

\[\langle\eta_{480}\rangle\ =\ 16.4\%\]

with a dispersion of 6.5%. Figure (1) shows the 480 nm estimed quantum efficiency distribution for the whole set of PMTs.

_Figure 1 : Distribution of the estimed 480 nm quantum efficiency for the whole set of 65 R5900 dedicated to Module 0._

In order to cross-check these estimations, we correlate for each PMT that 480 nm quantum efficiency with the 480 nm photocathode current. These two PMTs characteristics are strongly correlated as soon as the voltage between photocathode and all other tied dynodes is above 50 Volts, that is when the measured photocathode current reach a plateau, and one could assume that this photocathode current is independant of the PMT's light collection efficiency (\(\sim 90\%\)).

The relative photocathode sensitivity of the 65 PMT's had been measured previously in four differents laboratories (Pisa, Valencia, Illinois, and Clermont) before their use in Module 0. To be consistent we perform the cross-check with PMT's of a same subset measured in one place, and used one of the sample as a reference.

Figures (2) represent the correlation between the estimated 480 nm quantum efficiency (x-axis), and the 480 nm photocathode current measured at the "plateau" (y-axis). These comparisons show clearly that these two sets of data are correlated.

For each subset of PMT's, one of the PMT had been used as a reference: #5M18C3 for Clermont subset, #5M27C5 for Valencia subset, #6A12C7 for Illinois subset and #6A31C4 for Pisa subset._

## 2 Direct measurements of the quantum efficiency

Even if the correlation of the 480 nm quantum efficiency estimation with the 480 nm photocathode current measurement indicates that we could have some confidence in our method, these are only estimations. It is why direct measurements of the 480 nm were performed on a set of 110 R5900 of the same generation of those of the Module 0.

480 nm quantum efficiency was measured using a reference PMT which is itself calibrated on a specific test bench as shown on Figure (3). In this test bench, the wavelength of the monochromatic light is selected with a FWHM of 10 nm. Then the light on the active photocathode surface of the reference PMT is measured with a calibrated photodiode.

_Figure 3 : Experimental set-up used for the calibration of the reference tube used to measure 480 nm quantum efficiency of R5900. The wavelength of the monochromatic light is selected with a FWHM of 10 nm, and the quantum efficiency of the reference PMT at that specific wavelength is measured from a calibrated photodiode when using mirror to illuminate this photodiode._Measured quantum efficiency distribution is reported in Figure (4). The 4 80 nm quantum efficiency is on the average of,

\[\langle\eta_{480}\rangle\ =\ 16.98\%\]

with a dispersion of 6.3%. To be compared to \(\langle\eta_{480}\rangle\ =\ 16.4\%\) with a dispersion of 6.5% for the estimated quantum efficiency values.

The correlation with the photocathode current had also been measured only for a subset of 41 PMT's. Figure (4) shows the 480 nm quantum efficiency distribution for this subset of PMTs, and Figure (5) the correlation between the measured 480 nm quantum efficiency and the measured 480 nm photocathode current.

Using data the 480 nm quantum efficiency had been fitted as,

\[Q.E.(480\ nm)\ =\ 2.2862\ I_{k}(480\ nm)\ +\ 4.9877\]

with a correlation factor of 0.9146

## 3. Conclusions

First, measurements and estimations of the 480 nm quantum efficiency are both compatible: \(\sim 17\%\) on the average.

The dispersion of the distribution is 6.5%. Figure (7) shows what is the proportion of selected PMTs when applying a cutt-off on the 480 nm quantum efficiency: a minimum quantum efficiency of 17% selects only 52% of the 110 PMTs. On the other hand when dropping out only 10% of the PMTs, the minimum 480 nm quantum efficiency of the remaining PMTs is \(\sim 16\%\).

The measurement of the quantum efficiency remains to be experimentally very difficult since one should use of a monochromatic well calibrated light detectector (photodiodes or PMT). But the correlation between the 480 nm photocathode current and the cathode quantum efficiency is still the best way to check easily the PMT's quantum efficiency.

_Figure 7 : Proportion of selected PMTs when applying a cutt-off on the 480 nm quantum efficiency: a minimum quantum efficiency of \(17\%\) selects only \(52\%\) of the PMTs. On the other hand when dropping out only \(10\%\) of the PMTs, the minimum 480 nm quantum efficiency of the remaining PMTs \(is\sim 16\%\)._
