**Abstract**

This note summarizes studies performed in order to estimate the potential of ATLAS to measure the top quark mass from the first few hundred pb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The analyses shown here, based on fully simulated events, have been performed for the channel where the top quarks decay into one lepton plus a number of jets, using various methods to extract the top quark mass. The performance of the detector has been evaluated, including triggering, particle identification, and jet reconstruction. For each method, the expected background, statistical and systematic uncertainties, and linearity have been studied. This work shows that the precision on the top quark mass depends mainly on the jet energy scale uncertainty: a precision of the order of 1 to 3.5 GeV should be achievable with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), assuming a jet energy scale uncertainty of 1 to 5%.

Introduction

At the LHC, top quarks will be produced mainly in pairs through the hard processes \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) (90%) and \(q\bar{q}\to t\bar{t}\) (10%). The corresponding cross section, at next-to-leading order, is 833 pb [1]; therefore, we expect roughly 800 000 \(t\bar{t}\) pairs to be produced with an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), corresponding to about two weeks at a luminosity equal to \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). In contrast to earlier measurements of the top quark mass [2], which concentrated on preserving as much of the signal as possible in order to minimize the statistical uncertainty, the LHC will produce so many top quark pairs that rather stringent requirements can be imposed, to restrict the measurement to regions in which the systematic uncertainties can be well-controlled. With 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, the measurement will already be completely dominated by systematic uncertainties of the order of 1 GeV. The dominant contribution to the systematic uncertainty is expected to be the jet energy scale. In-situ calibration methods will allow the light jet energy scale to be known to the percent level precision after 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of collected data [3]. This high precision can be, at least in part, translated to the \(b\)-jet energy scale, although differences are expected. Detailed studies with the data will be necessary to reach the desired precision.

The top quark mass measurements described here are based on finding the peak in the invariant mass distribution of the top quark's decay products: a \(W\) boson and a \(b\)-quark jet. This closely corresponds to the pole mass of the top quark. Because of fragmentation effects, it is believed that the top quark mass determination in a hadronic environment is inherently ambiguous by an amount proportional to \(\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\)[4]: the intristic ambiguity is of the order of 100 MeV.

This note describes several ways to measure the top quark mass in the semi-leptonic channel, which corresponds to a \(t\bar{t}\) final state where one \(W\) boson decays leptonically while the other one decays into two jets. The primary results rely on a full reconstruction of the final state, with the mass estimator taken as the invariant mass of the three jets from the hadronically-decaying top quark. This has been studied for two cases. In the first case, both \(b\)-jets are identified via displaced vertices, and two different mass measurement methods are presented. In the second case, fewer \(b\)-jets are identified. This latter case is expected to be important during early running, before the detector is fully calibrated. An analysis which relies on a kinematic fit is also presented. Other \(t\bar{t}\) decay channels can also be used, but have not been considered in this note.

Another possibility relies on the determination of the mean distance of travel of b-flavoured hadrons from top quark decays [5]. The top quark mass can be inferred from the averaged lifetime in the laboratory frame of the b-flavoured hadron, since the bottom quark's boost directly impacts the lifetime of the b-flavoured hadron. Rather than measuring the lifetime, the transverse decay length of the b-flavoured hadron is used in this method. The mean of the transverse decay length distribution is determined for different assumed top quark masses, providing an estimator for the experimental data in the mean decay length as a function of the top quark mass. Since this analysis relies mainly on tracking, the systematic uncertainties are mostly uncorrelated with those of other methods; in particular, the influence of the jet energy scale as a source of uncertainty is negligible. Work is ongoing on this method, which is not shown here.

A last possibility is to estimate the top quark mass from the measured \(t\bar{t}\) production cross section. The errors on these quantities are related, in the Standard Model, via \(\Delta\sigma_{t\bar{t}}/\sigma_{t\bar{t}}\sim 5\Delta m_{\rm top}/m_{\rm top}\)[6]. This would allow a determination of \(m_{\rm top}\) independent of the kinematic reconstruction. In addition, it would be clear that the top quark mass is the one used in the perturbative calculations (i.e. the pole mass). However, even without considering experimental uncertainties, the achievable precision would already be limited to 2 GeV due to the uncertainty of the theoretical calculations. The scale dependence, which is the dominant source of uncertainty, might be reduced to the order of 6 % by performing the computation at higher orders, including the resummation of next-to-leading logarithmic corrections(NLL). This scale dependence can also be reduced by using a different mass definition such as the running mass2). This method is not considered further in this note.

Footnote 2): The dependency of the perturbative calculations convergence on the quark mass definition has been observed in other observables in which the running mass has led to better results [7, 8]. This would allow as well a determination of the top running mass.

## 2 Motivations for a precise top quark mass measurement

Electroweak precision observables in the Standard Model and the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) depend on the value of the top quark mass. Therefore, a precise measurement of the top quark mass is important for consistency tests of the Standard Model, to constrain the Higgs boson mass within the Standard Model, and to increase the sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model.

The most important dependency of the electroweak observables on the top quark mass arises via the one-loop radiative correction term \(\Delta r\)[9], which is related to the \(W\) boson mass through the relation \(m_{W}^{2}=\frac{\pi\alpha}{\sqrt{2G_{F}\sin^{2}_{\rm top}}}(1+\Delta r)\) (\(\Theta_{W}\) being the weak mixing angle, \(\alpha\) the fine structure constant and \(G_{F}\) the Fermi coupling constant). The top quark mass is present in \(\Delta r\) as terms proportional to \(m_{\rm top}^{2}/m_{Z}^{2}\), while the Higgs boson mass is present only in terms proportional to \(\log(m_{H}/m_{Z})\). Therefore, the dependence on the Higgs boson mass is much weaker than the dependence on the top quark mass.

The precision of the indirect prediction of the Higgs boson mass depends mainly on the uncertainty on the following quantities: the hadronic contribution to the electromagnetic coupling at the scale \(m_{Z}\)\(\Delta\alpha_{had}\), \(\sin^{2}_{\rm\Theta_{W}}\), \(W\) boson mass and top quark mass. For the current value of the top quark mass (\(m_{\rm top}\) = 172.6 \(\pm\) 1.4 GeV) [10], \(m_{H}=87^{+36}_{-27}\) GeV, implying \(m_{H}<\) 160 GeV at 95% C.L [11]. In order to ensure a similar contribution to the indirect prediction of the Higgs mass, the precision on \(m_{W}\) and \(m_{\rm top}\) must satisfy \(\Delta m_{W}\simeq 0.07\Delta m_{\rm top}\). At the LHC, we expect to reach an accuracy of 15 MeV on \(m_{W}\)[12] and 1 GeV on \(m_{\rm top}\). With these precision measurements, the relative precision on a Higgs boson mass of 115 GeV would be of the order of 18% [13].

## 3 Top quark mass measurement in the semi-leptonic channel with the standard ATLAS \(b\)-tagging

In this section we investigate the determination of the top quark mass using the standard ATLAS \(b\)-tagging.

### Physics background

The major sources of background, listed in Table 1, are single top events (Wt and t channels) and \(W\) boson production (\(W\) boson with \(W\to l\nu\) decay, \(W+b\bar{b}\) and \(W+c\bar{c}\)). It has been shown that backgrounds from \(Z+\rm{jet}\) events with \(Z\to ll\), \(WW\), \(WZ\), and \(ZZ\) gauge boson pair production have much smaller contributions [14]: therefore, their contribution has not been re-evaluated here. Backgrounds from QCD multi-jets and \(b\bar{b}\) production have not been investigated with full simulation. Nevertheless, studies performed on fast simulation have shown that these backgrounds are negligible after leptonic cuts (lepton \(p_{T}\), \(/\!\!\!\!E_{T}\)) [14].

Another source of background comes from \(t\bar{t}\) events themselves (fully leptonic or fully hadronic channels). Moreover, \(t\bar{t}\) events in which the \(W\) boson decays into \(\tau\nu_{\tau}\) are classified in the following way: \(\tau\) decaying leptonically belong to signal events, whereas \(\tau\) decaying hadronically belong to background (fully hadronic \(t\bar{t}\)).

Before any selection requirements, the signal to background ratio is of the order of \(\frac{800pb}{80mb}\), i.e. \(10^{-8}\).

### Combinatorial background

When a \(t\bar{t}\) semi-leptonic decay is reconstructed, one must choose which jets in the event to associate with the hadronic \(W\) boson decay and also which jets correspond to each of the two \(b\)-jets. When at least one of these choices is wrong, the event is classified as combinatorial background.

### Jets

All particles (electrons, muons, jets) forming the \(t\bar{t}\) final state are required to lie within \(|\eta|<2.5\), since \(b\)-jets cannot be tagged and muons are not reconstructed for higher values of \(|\eta|\). See Ref. [15] for a description of the features of jet selection that are common to all top quark analyses; only the points specific to the analyses in this note are discussed below.

#### 3.3.1 Jet calibration

This analysis uses jets defined as in [15]. The jet calibration effects are removed by performing a jet calibration to the parton level using the Monte Carlo information. This allows jet calibration to be disentangled from other effects on the top quark mass measurement from the other effects (selection, reconstruction, measurement methods). This is done by matching jets to partons before radiation (requiring \(\Delta R(\mathrm{quark},\mathrm{jet})\) lower than 0.2) and deriving the difference between reconstructed jet energy and the parton energy as a function of the parton energy. This is performed separately for \(b\)-quark jets with and without muons and for light jets. This procedure leads to a perfect and unbiased jet energy scale.

Uncertainties on the top quark mass measurement arising from the jet energy scale uncertainties will be assessed here by applying miscalibration factors to the calibrated jets.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l|c|c|c|c||} \hline Process & Number & 1 isolated lepton & \(>=4\) jets & 2 b-jets \\  & of events & \(p_{T}>20\) GeV & \(p_{T}>40\) GeV & \(p_{T}>40\) GeV \\  & & and \(\not\!\!E_{T}>20\)GeV & & \\ \hline \hline Signal & 313200 & 132380 & 43370 & 15780 \\ \hline \hline \(W\) boson backgrounds & 9.5 \(\times 10^{5}\) & 154100 & 9450 & 200 \\ \hline \hline all-jets (top pairs) & 466480 & 1020 & 560 & 160 \\ \hline di-lepton (top pairs) & 52500 & 16470 & 2050 & 720 \\ \hline \hline single top, t channel & 81500 & 24400 & 1230 & 330 \\ \hline single top, \(W\) t channel & 9590 & 8430 & 770 & 170 \\ \hline single top, s channel & 720 & 640 & 11 & 5 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Jet scales on data will be obtained in a different way. The light jet energy scale determination is explained in detail in a separate note [3]; the \(b\)-jet energy scale will be measured using Z+jets samples. The \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\) yield will be low at the start of LHC running; therefore, the \(b\)-jet scale will probably be derived from the measured light jet scale, together with a Monte Carlo correction term modelling the difference between the two jet energy scales.

#### 3.3.2 Jet labelling

A jet is called purely electromagnetic if the distance \(\Delta R\) to the nearest electromagnetic cluster is lower than 0.2 and the ratio between the cluster and jet energies is greater than 0.8. Only 0.15% of jets produced by hadronisation pass these cuts. Such objects are ignored for the remainder of the analysis.

A jet is tagged as a \(b\)-jet if its b-weight is larger than 6 (the weight is defined by the three-dimensional space \(b\)-tagging, described in the introduction of this chapter [15]). The \(b\)-tagging efficiency for this weight in \(t\bar{t}\) events is equal to 62% and the light (i.e. u, d and s flavoured) jet rejection to 130 for isolated (\(\Delta R(\mathrm{jet},\mathrm{jet})>0.8\)) jets with \(p_{T}\) greater than 15 GeV (Fig. 1).

All remaining jets (i.e. non b-tagged jets nor purely electromagnetic jets) are called light jets. Therefore, a b-jet which is not tagged by the b-tag algorithm is considered as a light jet.

#### 3.3.3 Jet multiplicity

* The light jet multiplicity, for signal events, is illustrated in Fig. 2.(a), for all light jets, and for light jets above the \(p_{T}\) cut applied (40 GeV). The multiplicity is often higher than two (47% of events, for jets above the \(p_{T}\) cut), due to the presence of initial and final state radiation. This has of course an impact on the combinatorial background size and shape.
* The \(b\)-jet multiplicity, illustrated in Fig. 2.(b), reflects the \(b\)-tagging efficiency.

### Event selection

#### 3.4.1 Trigger

The following Event Filter trigger [16] selections have been applied:

* At least one isolated electron with \(p_{T}\) greater than 25 GeV ("e22i"). This trigger is satisfied by 53% of \(t\bar{t}\)\(e+\mathrm{jets}\) events, and 71% of \(e+\mathrm{jets}\) with \(p_{T}\)(e) greater than 25 GeV pass.
* At least one isolated muon with \(p_{T}\) greater than 20 GeV ("mu20"). This trigger is satisfied by 59 % of \(t\bar{t}\)\(\mu+\mathrm{jets}\) events, and 74% of \(\mu+\mathrm{jets}\) with \(p_{T}\)(\(\mu\)) greater than 20 GeV pass.

#### 3.4.2 Standard cuts

A sequence of consecutive cuts is applied in order to reduce the contribution from physics background.

* Exactly one isolated lepton, with \(p_{T}>20\) (25) GeV for muons (electrons) and \(|\eta|<2.5\). This cut corresponds to the trigger selection. Moreover, the isolation criteria reject a large fraction of the leptonic \(b\)-decays in the all-jets channel: 99.6% of the \(t\bar{t}\) events with both \(W\) bosons decaying hadronically are rejected by this first selection step.
* Missing transverse energy cut: \(\not{E}_{T}>20\) GeV. Together with the lepton requirement, this cut reduces QCD background.
* At least four jets with \(p_{T}>40\) GeV. Below 40 GeV, jets are known to be less precisely calibrated; the jet energy scale will be discussed later on, as a source of systematic uncertainty. Therefore, they are removed in order to improve the precision of the top quark mass measurement [3]. Only 34% of hadronically-decaying \(W\) bosons have both jets passing this requirement. If it is relaxed so that one jet can have \(p_{T}\) down to 20 GeV, 88% of these \(W\) bosons pass, but the combinatorial and physical backgrounds increase. Moreover, due to initial and final state radiation (ISR, FSR), 30% of the signal events have more than two light jets with \(p_{T}>40\) GeV. Therefore, no requirement is made on the number of light jets.

* Among these jets, exactly two must be \(b\)-tagged.

#### 3.4.3 Purity definition

When a \(t\bar{t}\) semi-leptonic decay is reconstructed, one must choose which jets in the event to associate with the hadronic \(W\) boson decay and also which jets correspond to each of the two \(b\)-jets. The success of an algorithm for making such as choice is quantified as its _purity_, the fraction of events in which this choice is correct, based on looking at the Monte Carlo parentage information. For this purpose, jets are matched to the closest Monte Carlo parton with \(\Delta R<0.25\). Purities are defined for identifying the hadronically-decaying \(W\) boson (both light jets chosen are within 0.25 from the quark stemming from the \(W\) boson), the hadronic b-quark, and the hadronically-decaying top quark. Note that the top quark purity is not the product of the other two due to correlations.

### Hadronic \(W\) boson mass reconstruction

Several algorithms have been tried to choose the two light jets from the hadronically-decaying \(W\) boson. Three have been identified that give the best compromise between efficiency and purity:

* the \(\chi^{2}\) minimization method,
* the geometric method: this method consists in choosing the two closest jets,
* choosing the two light jets that give the mass closest to the known mass of the \(W\) boson [14].

The first and last methods are quite similar, but the first one contains in addition an event-by-event rescaling. Therefore, the last method will not be described here.

#### 3.5.1 Hadronic \(W\) boson mass reconstruction with \(\chi^{2}\) minimization method

Events kept after the selection described above have at least two light jets above the \(p_{T}\) threshold (50% of the events have more than two). Figure 3 shows the distribution of the invariant mass of the light jet pairs, in events with only two light jets. As a first step, we select the hadronic \(W\) boson candidates in a mass window of (\(\pm\) 30 GeV) around the peak value of this distribution (82 GeV).

The energy scale of the jets may be shifted, due to effects that include the energy lost out of the jet cone and initial and final state radiation effects, not taken into account in the default jet energy calibration [17]. Moreover, the effects of the jet \(p_{T}\) cut applied during event selection (explained in [3], section 3.3) contribute to the jet energy scale shift. To reduce the effect of such shifts on the final measured top quark mass, the jets are rescaled by constraining the pair to the known \(W\) boson mass using a \(\chi^{2}\) minimization. The quantity to be minimized is shown in Eq. (1). The first term constrains the jet pair mass \(M_{jj}\) to the \(W\) boson mass and width from the Particle Data Group [18] (\(M_{\rm W}^{\rm PDG}\), \(\Gamma_{\rm W}^{\rm PDG}\)). The other two terms are the usual \(\chi^{2}\) terms for scaling the jets with multiplicative constants \(\alpha_{E_{\rm j1,2}}\); \(\sigma_{1,2}\) are the light jet energy resolutions3).

Footnote 3: The light jet energy resolution has been estimated from the gaussian fit of the difference between a light jet energy and the corresponding quark energy. The expression thus obtained is the following: \(\sigma_{E}=E*\sqrt{(a^{2}/E)+b^{2}}\), where a = 0.989 GeV\({}^{1/2}\) and b = 0.075.

\[\chi^{2}\,=\,\frac{(M_{\rm jj}(\alpha_{E_{\rm j1}},\alpha_{E_{\rm j2}})-M_{ \rm W}^{\rm PDG})^{2}}{(\Gamma_{\rm W}^{\rm PDG})^{2}}\,+\,\frac{(E_{\rm j1}( 1-\alpha_{E_{\rm j1}}))^{2}}{\sigma_{1}^{2}}+\,\frac{(E_{\rm j2}(1-\alpha_{ E_{\rm j2}}))^{2}}{\sigma_{2}^{2}}. \tag{1}\]This \(\chi^{2}\) is minimized, event by event, for each light jet pair. The pair with the smallest \(\chi^{2}\) is kept as the hadronic \(W\) boson candidate. This minimization procedure also gives the corresponding energy correction factors \(\alpha_{E_{11}}\) and \(\alpha_{E_{2}}\), shown in Fig. 5. Given the jet energy resolution, the first term in Eq. (1) dominates the \(\chi^{2}\). Therefore, the hadronic \(W\) boson mass reconstructed with the light jets chosen by this \(\chi^{2}\) minimization is very narrow, as shown in Fig. 4. Further on, only the hadronic \(W\) boson candidates within a mass window of \(\pm\) 2 \(\Gamma_{\rm M_{W}}\) (\(\Gamma_{\rm M_{W}}^{\rm PDG}\) = 2.1 GeV) are kept; this cut is called **C0**.

#### 3.5.2 Hadronic \(W\) boson mass reconstruction with geometric method

In this method, the light jet pair with the smallest \(\Delta R\) distance between the two jets is taken as the hadronic \(W\) boson candidate. This method is simple and does not depend on the accuracy of the jet energy scale. The resulting \(W\) boson mass distribution is shown in Fig. 6. Only hadronic \(W\) boson candidates within a mass window of \(\pm\) 2 \(\sigma_{\rm M_{W}}\) (\(\sigma_{\rm M_{W}}\) = 10.4 GeV) around the peak value of the invariant mass distribution of all light jet pairs are kept; this cut is called **C1**.

### Leptonic \(W\) boson mass reconstruction

The main difficulty in reconstructing the leptonic \(W\) boson comes from the kinematics of the neutrino. The missing transverse momentum \(\not{E}_{T}\) is used as an estimate of the neutrino transverse momentum. This is, however, only an approximation, illustrated in Fig.7, as there may be other, softer, neutrinos in the event, such as from leptonic \(b\)-decay. With this hypothesis, \(p_{T}^{\nu}\) is underestimated by more than 2% (miscalibration of \(\not{E}_{T}\) and fake missing \(\not{E}_{T}\) also contributes to this shift).

Using the known \(W\) boson mass, four-momentum conservation for the \(W\to\ell+\nu\) decay gives a quadratic equation for the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum \(p_{x}^{\nu}\) (\(\ell\) stands for lepton and \(\nu\) stands for neutrino):Figure 5: Energy correction factors estimated by the \(\chi^{2}\) minimization.

Figure 6: Hadronic \(W\) boson mass with the geometric method (the contribution of physics background is shown in black, the one from combinatorial background, in grey).

\[M_{\rm W}^{2}=m_{\rm I}^{2}-2(p_{\rm x}^{1}p_{\rm x}^{\nu}+p_{\rm y}^{1}p_{\rm y}^{ \nu})+2E_{1}\sqrt{{E_{T}}^{2}+(p_{\rm z}^{\nu})^{2}}-2(p_{\rm z}^{1}p_{\rm z}^{ \nu}).\]

This equation has no solution if the measured \({E_{T}}\) fluctuates such that the neutrino-lepton invariant mass is above the \(W\) boson mass; this happens in 30% of the remaining events after the C0 cut. In this case, \(p_{T}^{\nu}\) is reduced until a solution is found, with the restriction that the transverse \(W\) boson mass remain below 90 GeV (see Fig. 8). Only 11% of the events still have no solution after this procedure. Otherwise, the equation has two solutions. The choice among the two \(p_{z}^{\nu}\) is performed together with the association of the \(b\)-jet to the corresponding \(W\) boson: the combination giving the smaller difference between the hadronic and leptonic top quark masses is kept.

### Top quark reconstruction

The two methods used for the hadronic \(W\) boson reconstruction lead to two methods for the top quark mass reconstruction. Moreover, additional cuts are applied in order to increase the purity of the selected sample; their relevance is illustrated below.

Once the hadronic \(W\) boson is reconstructed, the next step is to choose from the two \(b\)-jets the one to associate with the hadronic \(W\) boson in order to reconstruct the hadronic top quark. Several methods have been investigated:

* choose the \(b\)-jet that maximizes the hadronic top quark \(p_{T}\).
* Choose the \(b\)-jet closest to the hadronic \(W\) boson.
* Choose the \(b\)-jet furthest from the leptonic \(W\) boson.

All three methods give similar results, but the second method has a slightly higher purity, so that one has been chosen. The remaining \(b\)-jet and the leptonic \(W\) boson then define the leptonic top quark.

The performance of the analyses before any additional cuts is summarized in Tables 2 and 3, in a full top quark mass window and within \(\pm\) 3 \(\sigma_{m_{\rm top}}\), where \(\sigma_{m_{\rm top}}\) = 10 GeV.

Leptonic \(\tau\) decays are counted together with the signal.

#### 3.7.1 Additional cuts

Additional cuts can be applied in order to increase the final top purity (combinatorial background rejection).

* Cut **C2**: the invariant mass of the hadronic \(W\) boson and the \(b\)-jet associated to the leptonic \(W\) boson must be greater than 200.
* Cut **C3**: the invariant mass of the lepton and the \(b\)-jet associated to the leptonic \(W\) boson must be lower than 160.

These cuts are illustrated in Figs. 10 and 10. Their effects on efficiency and purity are shown in Tables 2 and 3.

The combinatorial background can be further suppressed with two more cuts [19]. These are defined based on the following variables, where \(E^{*}\) denotes the energy of a particle in the top quark rest frame:

\[X_{1} = E^{*}_{\rm W}-E^{*}_{\rm b}=E^{*}_{\rm j1}+E^{*}_{\rm j2}-E^{*}_{ \rm b}=\frac{M^{2}_{\rm W}-M^{2}_{\rm b}}{M_{\rm top}}, \tag{2}\] \[X_{2} = 2E^{*}_{\rm b}=\frac{M^{2}_{\rm top}-M^{2}_{\rm W}+M^{2}_{\rm b}} {M_{\rm top}}. \tag{3}\]

We call the peak and width of the \(X_{1,2}\) distributions \(\mu_{1,2}\) and \(\sigma_{1,2}\), as is found from simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events with \(m_{\rm top}=175\)  that satisfy all previous requirements. Then the two following cuts are defined:

* Cut **C4**: \(|X_{1}-\mu_{1}|<1.5\,\sigma_{1}\),
* Cut **C5**: \(|X_{2}-\mu_{2}|<2\,\sigma_{2}\).

These cuts are illustrated in Figs. 11 and 12. With respect to C2 and C3, these cuts reduce the efficiency by 30% but increase the purity to 85%, as shown in Tables 2 and 3. The numbers are identical in the full top quark mass window and within \(\pm\) 3 \(\sigma_{m_{\rm top}}\), since C4 and C5 restrict the top quark mass to a more stringent window than \(\pm\) 3 \(\sigma_{m_{\rm top}}\) around the peak value.

Table 4 summarizes the cuts applied in these analyses.

### Top quark mass measurement

In Fig. 13, the hadronic top quark mass reconstructed with the \(\chi^{2}\) minimization method is fit to the sum of a Gaussian and a polynomial (third degree). For 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), the fit Gaussian has its mean at \(175.0\pm 0.2\) GeV and a width of \(11.6\pm 0.2\) GeV (\(\chi^{2}\)/dof = 137/67). It is seen that C2 and C3 do not significantly shift the top quark mass: \(m_{\rm top}\,=\,174.8\,\pm\,0.3\) GeV with a width equal to 11.7 \(\pm\) 0.4 GeV (\(\chi^{2}\)/dof = 82/67: C2 and C3 improve significantly this value).

Figure 14 shows the result of the hadronic top mass reconstruction using the geometric method, fit to the sum of a Gaussian and a threshold function4)(left, \(\chi^{2}\)/dof = 97/75) and to a pure Gaussian (right, \(\chi^{2}\)/dof = 38/24). After all cuts, the Gaussian mean fits to \(175.0\pm 0.4\) GeV with a width of \(14.3\pm 0.3\) GeV. The width is larger than with the \(\chi^{2}\) minimization method since no attempt is made to perform an event-by-event rescaling of the light jets. Nevertheless, the contribution of the light jets to the top quark mass resolution can be removed to first order by computing the top quark mass as \(m_{\rm top}=M_{\rm jjb}-M_{\rm jj}+M_{\rm W}^{\rm peak}\). The results of this geometric method with rescaling are shown in Fig. 15. The width decreases to 10.6 GeV, consistent with the results from the \(\chi^{2}\) minimization method.

Footnote 4): The formula of the threshold function used is the following:

\[A\cdot e^{-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x-M_{\rm top}}{M_{\rm top}}\right)^{2}}+CstBdf \cdot(x-threshold)^{b}\cdot e^{-c(x-threshold)} \tag{4}\]

. The width decreases to 10.6 GeV, consistent with the results from the \(\chi^{2}\) minimization method.

Table 5 summarizes the fit results from all the methods discussed here.

### Kinematic fit

The top quark mass can be extracted from a kinematic fit using a \(\chi^{2}\) based on the entire final state, as defined in equation (5). The terms in the first line consist of the usual \(\chi^{2}\) terms5), while the last four constrain the object masses. The resolutions are extracted from Monte Carlo. The \(\chi^{2}\) is calculated event by event and the resulting \(\chi^{2}\) distribution, shown in Fig. 17, exhibits a higher purity for lower \(\chi^{2}\) values. The purity of the final sample could be improved by cutting on the \(\chi^{2}\).

Footnote 5: The \(m\) index stands for measured quantities and the\(f\) index, for fitted quantities. E, \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) are respectively the energy, pseudo-rapidity and polar angle of the considered objects.

\[\begin{split}\chi^{2}=\sum_{\rm jets}((\frac{\eta_{\rm i}^{\rm m }-\eta_{\rm i}^{\rm f}}{\sigma_{\rm i}^{\rm m}})^{2}+(\frac{\phi_{\rm i}^{\rm m }-\phi_{\rm i}^{\rm f}}{\sigma_{\phi}^{\rm i}})^{2})+\sum_{\rm jets,lepton}( \frac{\rm E_{\rm i}^{\rm m}-E_{\rm i}^{\rm f}}{\sigma_{\rm i}^{\rm i}})^{2}+ \sum_{\rm x,y,z}(\frac{\rm P_{\rm i}^{\rm m}-P_{\rm i}^{\rm f}}{\sigma_{\rm i \nu}})^{2}\\ +(\frac{m_{\rm jj}-M_{\rm W}^{\rm PDG}}{\sigma_{W}})^{2}+(\frac{ m_{\rm l\nu}-M_{\rm W}^{\rm PDG}}{\sigma_{W}})^{2}+(\frac{m_{\rm l\bar{\rm j}b _{\rm h}}-m_{\rm top}^{\rm fit}}{\sigma_{\rm f}})^{2}+(\frac{m_{l\nu b_{\rm l }}-m_{\rm top}^{\rm fit}}{\sigma_{\rm f}})^{2}.\end{split} \tag{5}\]

The \(\chi^{2}\) minimization provides a high constraint on the jets from \(W\) boson. In an earlier study [14], it has been shown that the accuracy of the determination of the top quark mass depends on the \(\chi^{2}\). For events in which the b-quark jets are well measured and extra final state effects are small, the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit is close to 0 and produces a top quark mass value reflecting the Monte Carlo generated top quark mass. For larger \(\chi^{2}\) value, this top quark mass value decreases while the fraction of b-quarks with a large gluon radiation increases. This observation can be used by performing a linear fit to the extracted top quark mass as a function of the \(\chi^{2}\). The fit is shown on Fig. 17 where the top mass distribution is fitted by a gaussian for each \(\chi^{2}\) slice. The most accurate estimate of the top quark mass is obtained by extrapolating this linear fit to \(\chi^{2}=0\). This procedure should lead to a lower sensitivity to final state radiation effects of the extracted top quark mass, which is found to be \(m_{\rm top}=174.8\pm 0.4\) GeV, where the uncertainty is statistical.

This method is more computationally intensive than the others to assess the systematics, and is not considered further in this note.

### Statistical uncertainties

The statistical uncertainties quoted have been evaluated using a single simulated experiment with statistics corresponding to \(1\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). To evaluate the reliability of these estimates, a bootstrap resampling technique has been used [20].

The pull distributions for the top quark mass measurement \((M_{\mathrm{i}}-M_{\mathrm{gen}})/\sigma_{\mathrm{M_{i}}}\) have been produced for each method using 1200 pseudo-experiments. The biases and widths are reported in Table 5 for all the analyses shown in this note. Fig. 18 shows the pull distributions for the \(\chi^{2}\) minimization method and for the geometric method, after cuts **C2** through **C5**. All pull mean values are of size 0.5 or less: this indicates that the biases induced by the methods of measuring the top quark mass are of the order of 0.1 to 0.2 GeV depending on the cuts applied. The pull widths are slightly larger than 1; this indicates that the statistical uncertainty of the fit is slightly underestimated.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l|l|c|c|c|c||} \hline Method & Cuts & Top quark mass & \(\sigma\) & Pull & Pull \\  & & [GeV] & [GeV] & bias & width \\ \hline \hline \(\chi^{2}\) minimization & **C0** & 175.0 \(\pm\) 0.2 & 11.6 \(\pm\) 0.2 & \(-\)0.3 & 1.23 \\ \hline \(\chi^{2}\) minimization & **C0**, **C2**, and **C3** & 174.8 \(\pm\) 0.3 & 11.7 \(\pm\) 0.4 & \(-\)0.2 & 1.11 \\ \(\chi^{2}\) minimization & **C0**, **C2**, **C3**, **C4**, and **C5** & 174.8 \(\pm\) 0.3 & 11.8 \(\pm\) 0.4 & \(-\)0.5 & 1.00 \\ \hline Geometric & **C1**, **C2**, and **C3** & 174.6 \(\pm\) 0.5 & 14.1 \(\pm\) 0.5 & \(-\)0.39 & 1.03 \\ \hline Geometric & **C2**, **C3**, **C4** and **C5** & 175.0 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 14.3 \(\pm\) 0.3 & \(-\)0.37 & 1.11 \\ \hline Geometric and rescaling & **C1**, **C2**, and **C3** & 175.4 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 10.6 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 0.51 & 1.10 \\ \hline Geometric and rescaling & **C2**, **C3**,**C4**, and **C5** & 175.3 \(\pm\) 0.3 & 10.6 \(\pm\) 0.2 & 0.17 & 1.15 \\ Kinematic fit & & 174.8 \(\pm\) 0.4 & & & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Systematic uncertainties

The statistical uncertainty on the top quark mass being negligible with a few fb\({}^{-1}\) of collected data, the total uncertainty will quickly be dominated by the systematic uncertainties. All the contributions are listed below and summarized in Table 6.

#### 3.11.1 Jet energy scale (JES)

The effect of the uncertainty of the jet energy scale on the top quark mass measurement has been estimated by multiplying separately the light jet and \(b\)-jet momenta by several rescaling factors (20 factors, between \(-10\%\) and \(+10\%\)). Neither the event selection nor the \(\not{E}_{T}\) have been changed after this jet energy rescaling.

The resulting top quark mass depends linearly on the rescaling factor. The related systematic uncertainty on the top quark mass can therefore be expressed as a percentage of the light jet and \(b\)-jet energy scale miscalibration.

* The uncertainty in the \(b\)-jet energy scale produces an uncertainty in the top quark mass of 0.7 GeV/%. The \(b\)-jet scale will ultimately be determined with data from \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\). However, at the start of LHC running, the \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\) statistics will be low, so the \(b\)-jet scale will be derived from the measured light jet scale togheter with a Monte Carlo correction term modelling the difference between the two jet energy scales. The systematic uncertainty associated with these methods has not been yet evaluated.
* The uncertainty in the light jet energy scale produces an uncertainty in the top quark mass of 0.2 GeV/%. The reduced dependence compared to that of the \(b\)-jet energy scale is due to the \(W\) boson mass constraint used in the rescaling (\(\chi^{2}\) minimization method or kinematical fit) or the definition of the top quark mass estimator (geometric with rescaling method). It has been shown that the light jet energy scale should be known with a precision of 1% in 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data [3]: the corresponding uncertainty on the top quark mass would therefore be 0.2 GeV.

#### 3.11.2 Initial and final state radiation (ISR and FSR)

The study of the effect of initial and final state radiation on the top quark mass measurement is still preliminary. Several samples have been simulated for this study, corresponding to different sets of parameters:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l|c|c||} \hline Systematic uncertainty & \(\chi^{2}\) minimization method & geometric method \\ \hline \hline Light jet energy scale & 0.2 GeV/\% & 0.2 GeV/\% \\ \hline b jet energy scale & 0.7 GeV/\% & 0.7 GeV/\% \\ \hline ISR/FSR & \(\simeq 0.3\) GeV & \(\simeq 0.4\) GeV \\ \hline b quark fragmentation & \(\leq 0.1\) GeV & \(\leq 0.1\) GeV \\ \hline Background & negligible & negligible \\ \hline Method & 0.1 to 0.2 GeV & 0.1 to 0.2 GeV \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Systematic uncertainties on the top quark mass measured in the semi-leptonic channel.

* Sample 1: AcerMC \(t\bar{t}\) events, with maximum reconstructed top quark mass (half the default value of \(\Lambda\)(QCD) for FSR; twice the default value of \(\Lambda\)(QCD) for ISR).
* Sample 2: AcerMC \(t\bar{t}\) events, with default ISR and FSR parameters.
* Sample 3: AcerMC \(t\bar{t}\) events, with minimum reconstructed top quark mass (twice the default value of \(\Lambda\)(QCD) for FSR, half the default value of \(\Lambda\)(QCD) for ISR

For each sample, a specific jet calibration has been applied (separately for \(b\)-jets and light jets).

The measured top quark masses are summarised in Table 7. A shift on the top quark mass is observed. A first estimate of the systematic uncertainty due to initial and final state radiation can be estimated from the relative difference between these three top quark mass values: it is approximately equal to 0.3 GeV (more statistics would be necessary for a more precise estimate).

This preliminary study shows the impact on the top quark mass measurement of a given change of ISR/FSR parameters, but the estimate of the systematic uncertainty due to ISR or FSR will benefit from a measurement of these effects with ATLAS data. Figure 19 shows, for example, that the jet multiplicity could help to determine the size of the initial and final state radiation contribution. Initial state radiation could be measured with Drell-Yan events, as has been done at the Tevatron.

#### 3.11.3 b-quark fragmentation

The effect of b-quark fragmentation has been estimated by varying the Peterson parameter within its uncertainty (study performed on fast simulation [14]).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||} \hline Sample & Top quark mass [GeV] & \(\sigma\) [(GeV) \\ \hline \hline
1 & 176.6 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 13.4 \(\pm\) 0.6 \\ \hline
2 & 176.3 \(\pm\) 0.7 & 13.7 \(\pm\) 0.8 \\ \hline
3 & 176.3 \(\pm\) 0.5 & 12.7 \(\pm\) 0.6 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 19: Light and \(b\)-jet multiplicity for several values of the ISR/FSR parameters (\(p_{T}\)(jet) \(>\) 40 GeV).

The resulting uncertainty is lower than 0.1.

#### 3.11.4 Background estimate

Variations in the size of the background have no noticeable effect on the extracted top quark mass. Nevertheless, it is important to extract the shape of the background from data.

### Linearity of the method

The analysis leading to the top quark mass measurement has been applied to samples corresponding to several values of generated top quark mass. Figures 20 and 21 show that both methods have good linearity. The reconstructed top quark mass lies above the generated one by an average offset equal to 0.2% of \(m_{\rm top}\). This comes from the \(p_{T}\) jet spectrum which is different for each sample with a different generated top quark mass [3]. The jet energy scale is then a little bit different in each sample due to the \(p_{T}\) cut applied on jets.

Top quark mass measurement in the semi-leptonic channel with relaxed requirements on the \(b\)-tagging

At the start of LHC running, the detector will not be optimized and will require a commissioning phase with first data to calibrate its sub-components. This is particularly true for the pixel detector and its capability to tag \(b\)-jets. Thus, it could be useful to have a top quark mass measurement analysis in which the use of \(b\)-tagging is reduced. This is addressed in this section by performing a first analysis in which exactly one \(b\)-jet is \(b\)-tagged (the assumed \(b\)-tagging efficiency is the same as before: \(\epsilon_{b}\simeq 60\%\)). This sample has no events in common with the sample used in section 3. In a second analysis, \(b\)-tagging is not used in the reconstruction of the \(t\bar{t}\) events. Even if not used, this sample contains events with 0, 1, or 2 \(b\)-tagged jets and overlap with the other two samples.

Figure 20: Reconstructed top quark mass with 2 \(b\)-tagged jets as a function of the generated top quark mass (left: \(\chi^{2}\) minimization method, after C0 cut; right: geometric method after C1 cut). The method has good linearity.

### Displaced vertex \(b\)-tagging, 1 \(b\)-tagged jet

The sample is here limited to events with no more than five jets. In this case, the best method to select the two light jets from the \(W\) boson is the one which minimizes \(M_{\mathrm{jj}}-M_{W}^{\mathrm{peak}}\). The \(b\)-jet associated with the hadronic top quark decay is then chosen among the remaining light jets and the tagged \(b\)-jet. The best choice is the one which minimizes \(\sqrt{\left(X_{1}-\mu_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(X_{2}-\mu_{2}\right)^{2}}\) (see equations (2) and (3)).

A large fraction of the non-hadronic \(b\)-jets is removed by requiring the \(b\)-jet to be closer to the reconstructed \(W\) boson than the lepton originating from the leptonic top quark decay:

* cut \(\mathbf{C6}:\Delta R(\mathrm{lepton},b_{\mathrm{had}})-\Delta R(W,b_{ \mathrm{had}})>1\)

As in previous sections, the purification cuts **C1** and **C3** are applied. Harder purification cuts (**C4** and **C5**) could also be applied. The top quark mass spectra derived after applying the two sets of purification cuts are shown in Fig. 22.

Table 8 summarizes the reconstruction efficiency and purity related to this reconstruction method for both sets of cuts.

The systematic uncertainties on the top quark mass measurement, determined in the same way as in the previous section, are summarized in Table 9.

The top quark mass values obtained are shown in Table 10 together with the pull distribution results. The single-tag sample can be added to the double-tagged sample to perform a top quark mass measurement with 50% more signal events.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l|c|c|c|c|c||} \hline Cuts & Efficiency (\%) & \(W\) boson purity (\%) & b purity (\%) & top purity (\%) & Number of events \\ \hline \hline

### Top quark mass measurement in the semi-leptonic channel assuming no \(b\)-tagging

The same analysis is performed with no use of \(b\)-tagging information. The main difference with the two \(b\)-tagged analysis comes from the larger contribution of the combinatorial and physics background.

The corresponding top mass spectra are given in Fig. 23 for both sets of cuts. Table 11 summarizes the efficiency and purity related to this method.

The systematic uncertainties on the top quark mass measurement are summarized in Table 9. The obtained top quark mass values together with the pull distribution results are shown in Table 10.

For the second set of cuts (right plot of Fig. 23), the background contribution (\(\simeq\) 45 % of the sample) is peaked exactly below the signal contribution, preventing a fit using a parametrization like gaussian function (signal) + polynomial function (background). An event mixing technique has been used to fix the background shape in the parametrization. The event mixing technique consists in replacing one of the two jets momentum associated to the W with a simulated jet whose energy, \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) distribution is randomly selected according to the global energy, \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) distributions observed for the jets associated to the W. This technique looks very promising as shown in Fig. 24 comparing data and event mixing samples for the two jet and three jet invariant masses after preselection.

## 5 Conclusion

Several methods have been investigated in order to perform an accurate top quark mass measurement with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of collected data, in the \(t\bar{t}\) semi-leptonic channel. The best top quark mass determination is achieved with two \(b\)-tagged events and a top mass estimator taken as the invariant mass of the three jets from hadronically-decaying top quark; the uncertainty on the top quark mass measurement with this analysis will be dominated by systematics, the statistical uncertainty being already small (\(\leq\)0.4 GeV). The precision on the top quark mass relies mainly on the jet energy scale uncertainty: a precision of the order of 1 to 3.5 GeV should be achievable with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), assuming a jet energy scale uncertainty of 1 to 5%. \(W\) boson sample can be extracted from the \(t\bar{t}\) sample in order to constrain the light jet energy scale. The main uncertainty on the top quark mass measurement will come from the b-jet energy scale.

Events with one or no \(b\)-tagged jets lead also to an interesting measurement if the background (physical and combinatorial) shape is constrained from data. The estimated precision on the top quark mass value is below 2 GeV (assuming a jet energy scale uncertainty of the order of the percent), with a very good signal over background ratio. These samples are thus very useful for jet energy scale or \(b\)-tagging studies during the commissioning phase with early data.
