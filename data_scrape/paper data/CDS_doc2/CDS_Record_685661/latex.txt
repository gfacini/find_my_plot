**Abstract**

We present how to integrate the FERMI readout system to the electromagnetic central barrel of the ATLAS experiment. The considered case includes the 2-D integrated preshower (also called the UVGEM preshower). A solution with a minimum of added dead material, optimised cabling, Level-1 trigger combination and eventual pre-processing is proposed. It represents a total of 100.352 channels to be treated.

## 1 Introduction

At the time people are starting to design the detectors for LHC, it is important to start thinking how to integrate the readout electronics, and especially the parts which are going to sit on or very nearby the detectors. This includes of course, having a first evaluation of the cabling, the power dissipation, the supply of high and low voltages needed, the cooling system and the mechanical implementation and location of these electronics. In the framework of the Liquid Argon Unit of ATLAS, FERMI was reported on the subject last April. This note is a first attempt to push further the ideas presented at that time [1]. It will concentrate on the general description of the readout architecture proposed, using the _FERMI concept_ (see Section 2) and its main consequences in terms of space occupancy, of power dissipation and of cabling (see Section 3). The calorimeter considered here is the central electromagnetic barrel with the 2D-integrated preshower "a la UVGEM" of the ATLAS experiment. The number of channels and trigger cell organization is derived from the one presented by J. Colas [2]. For all what concerns the description of FERMI and any information related to this digital Front-End and Readout M!crosystem for the calorimetry at LHC, we refer the reader to the last DRDC status report of the FERMI Collaborationand all the references therein [3].

## 2 The proposed readout architecture using FERMI

One of the attractive point concerning the FERMI approach is that it fits in a natural way with the Level-1 architecture of any experiment. This is due to the fact that it is a modular system and that the modularity can be made to follow the Level-1 trigger architecture as the elementary unit of the FERMI system, namely the FERMI module, can be adapted to treat the number of channels corresponding to the one defining an elementary cluster cell in the trigger. In the case we are considering here, the Level-1 elementary trigger cell is defined as follows [2]:

* _In (U,V) coordinates for the 1st sample in depth in the e.m. calorimeter, it groups 16 cells in U, and 16 cells in V_
* _In (\(\eta,\phi\)) coordinates for the 2nd sample in depth in the e.m. calorimeter, it groups \(4x4\) cells_
* _In (\(\eta,\phi\)) coordinates for the 3rd sample in depth in the e.m. calorimeter, it groups 2 x 4 cells_

### Elementary Level-1 trigger cells and the FERMI modules

According to the structure above, there is a total of three different types of elementary level-1 trigger cells. They cover the region in the (\(\eta,\phi\)) space corresponding to (\(\Delta\eta=0.1\))\(z\)(\(\Delta\phi=\pi/32\)) and each one of them correspond to a sampling in depth in the calorimetry. Let's assume that to cope with these differences in the organization of the elementary trigger cells for each sampling in depth of the calorimeter, we built two types of FERMI modules, namely one type of FERMI module will treat 16 channels (let's label it : \(FERMI_{16}\)), whereas the other type of FERMI will treat 8 channels (let's label it \(FERMI_{8}\)). The size of the \(FERMI_{16}\) will be 60 x 60 \(mm^{2}\), and the size of the \(FERMI_{8}\) will be 40 x 40 \(mm^{2}\). The quoted sizes are preliminary and will depend upon the final choice of package, the CMOS technology etc...

It is usefull at this stage to briefly remind the main components which define the FERMI environment. As it is well known, FERMI is a full readout system for calorimetry [3]. It offers a full readout architecture. This architecture is made in a modular way starting from the most elementary component, namely the FERMI module which fully process the signal as delivered by a number of calorimeter channels which basically correspond to the number of channels forming an elementary trigger cell. Presently in the ATLAS calorimetry this number is typically 4 x 4 channels. A certain number of FERMI modules are then grouped into a Fermi board, which will include of the order of 20 to 40 FERMI modules. This FERMI board will sit on or nearby to the detector and will have a FERMI board controller which ensures the connection of the FERMI modules with the "outside world", through an electro-optical interface and the associated optical fibers. The number of channels treated by each FERMI board is of the order of a few hundreds (300 to 400). The FERMI board can be arranged in a way to correspond to a larger subdivision of the trigger/readout architecture. For instance, following the sampling of the calorimetry part in \((\eta,\phi)\) cones of a certain size and summed over all sampling in depth of the calorimeter, the FERMI board can be associated to these cones which are often called "towers". These towers constitute larger sectors of the Level-1 trigger and DAQ system architecture. As last component of the FERMI environment there will be the Remote FERMI Board (RFB)which will be sitting in the control room. It will still have higher levels of control and processing than the FERMI board and will group in one RFB the information corresponding to a few FERMI boards directly linked to it through optical fibers. Of course, in the RFB, one can combine the information from different types of calorimeters such as for instance, the e.m. and the hadronic parts of the central barrel. The RFB will be directly interfaced to the DAQ system of the experiment. For instance an RFB could be well associated to the ROI as defined in EAST.

### Elementary tower of the Level-1 trigger

A first stage in defining a tower of the Level-1 trigger, in the e.m. calorimetry is by grouping the three elementary cells corresponding to the three samplings in depth of the cone in \((\Delta\eta,\Delta\phi)=(0.1,\pi/32)\). This would correspond to:

* _In the 1st sample in depth: 16 U channels grouped into one \(FERMI_{16}\) module_
* _In the 1st sample in depth: 16 V channels grouped into one \(FERMI_{16}\) module_
* _In the 2nd sample in depth: (4x4) channels in (\(\eta,\phi\)), grouped into one \(FERMI_{16}\) module_
* _In the 3rd sample in depth: (2x4) channels in (\(\eta,\phi\)), grouped into one \(FERMI_{8}\) module_
* **This represents a total of 56 channels read out by three \(FERMI_{16}\) modules plus one \(FERMI_{8}\) module**

We call this entity an **horizontal row of the FERMI board** that we are going to define now.

### Supertower of the Level-1 trigger and the FERMI board

In ATLAS, the central barrel will cover the region in \(\eta\) going from -1.4 to +1.4. Let's define a supertower as the region in \((\eta,\phi)\) space corresponding to \((0.7,\pi/32)\) and moreover grouping all the related samplings in depth. This follows the mechanical definition of a supertower in the central barrel e.m. calorimetry. Of course we could adapt the proposed modularity to any other relevant definition.

Let's define a FERMI board, as the FERMI entity which corresponds to this supertower of the detector. This FERMI board will then group together 7 x (three \(FERMI_{16}\) modules plus one \(FERMI_{8}\) module), so a total of 28 FERMI modules. It will fully treat the information of the corresponding **392 channels** of the calorimeter. It will be made of 7 **"horizontal rows"** as defined in the previous subsection. The size of the card to which it would correspond is 45 x 25 \(cm^{2}\), so roughly the size of a fastbus card.

One should note that this is just a proposed definition for the FERMI board, it can be defined differently according to the wanted purpose and use and in particular to the trigger and DAQ architecture definition. But this is an educated guess and, as such, it gives an idea of the number of channels and FERMI modules, a FERMI board will correspond to. One must also note that the FERMI board is part of the second stage of the FERMI R&D, just starting now. Figure 1, sketches in a very preliminary way how this FERMI board looks like within the environment we have just briefly described above (see Subsection 2.1) Related to this FERMI board there is a total of 3 optical fibers which will carry the necessary informations. One of this fiber is the information -coming from the BCO timing/general control signals as delivered by the so-called Taylor-system. The two other fibers are two fibers which send out of the 'FERMI board the FERMI-processed informations for Level-1 (one fiber) and the DAQ system (the second fiber). Finally one should also note that the estimate for the power consumption per FERMI channel is equal or less than one watt total. It is important to note that it corresponds to the full processing that FERMI does on each channel, before restoring the information to the DAQ system; Namely the processing includes the front-end treatment, digitization, level-1 full processing (FIR Filter), Level-1 and Level-2 pipelined memory, level-2 full processing (FIR-OS digital filter).

## 3 The consequences in terms of space occupancy, cabling, cooling, etc...

We have summarized the first important consequences of the integration of such a readout system in the framework of the central e.m. calorimetry in the two Tables below. In Table 1 we indicate the correspondance between the current Level-1 trigger architecture and the proposed architecture for the FERMI environment.

In Table 1 we introduce the concept of a "FERMI-box". This is a possibility which is foreseeable, depending the requirements of the mechanics of the detector. Indeed we aim to directly fix each FERMI board in the available space, as near as possible of the feedthroughs of the calorimeter cryostat, on the walls of the detector. This is to take advantage of this interesting feature of the FERMI system; There is no need to have special crates to install these cards. But if for any reason, the cards must be placed by groups in several well defined locations, one may then foresee to put them together by groups of say N FERMI-boards, in a simple mechanical box, that we label, a "FERMI-box". We are studying the various possible scenarios together with the definition of the mechanics of this detector and in particular of the feedthroughs.

The corresponding important integration parameters for this scenario with FERMI are summarized in Table 2.

In particular one must note the following important/relevant numbers: With the proposed architecture, they will be in each hole due to the cryostat of the central e.m. barrel, 128 FERMI boards. It represents a total volume of roughly \(0.22m^{3}\) per cryostat-crack and a total of 272 optical fibers per crack. This number of fibers is obtained in multiplexing the signals from the Taylor system for each group of 8 FERMI boards. If no multiplexing there is a total of 384 optical fibers per cryostat crack. The total crack volume, not instrumented is \(12m^{3}\). So the proposed FERMI system occupies only 1.8%. This do show the compactness of such a system. The power dissipation corresponding to a FERMI board as defined in our present example is of the order of 400 watts per board. We are studying in more details the power dissipation in the board and how to implement the cooling system

## 4 Conclusion

We have discussed in this note, how to possibly implement the FERMI readout architecture within the calorimeter topology and the Level-1 trigger and DAQ architectures, taking as an example the case of the central electromagnetic barrel of ATLAS and one of the possible preshower option. This is just a possible scenario we have imagined. Many others are foreseeable according to the final design of the trigger and DAQ architecture of this detector without forgetting more definite ideas about the mechanical design of the detector and its surrounding infrastructure. But it already gives a quasi-realistic approach of how the FERMI environment can easily fit to any calorimeter readout architecture. It also gives an idea of the compactness of this full readout system and of the easiness of its implementation not only from the electronics but also the mechanical and engeneering points of view. Still more realistics studies are underway for what concerns the mechanical implementations near the feedthrough and the proposed cooling system. It will be circulated soon in a forthcoming note.
