## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS muon spectrometer is based on a 8 coils toroid magnet which generates an approximately toroidal magnetic field over a radial distance of the order of 5 m with an average field integral of 2.7 T.m. More details on the magnet design can be found in [1]. The momentum determination rests on a sagitta measurement using 3 layers of chambers. The chamber layout has been optimized with respect to spectrometer resolution, geometrical acceptance, access to electronics, alignment facilities using projective light rays, field inhomogeneities and chamber construction. A more detailed description of the ATLAS muon spectrometer with its resolution on momentum measurement can be found in [2]. In the barrel part, the resolution, at the level of 2%, is dominated by multiple scattering in the magnet and the middle chamber material for momenta below 150 GeV. At very high momenta, the resolution is limited by the chamber precision (of the order of 50 \(\upmu\)m on the sagitta measurement) which results in a less than 10% error for P\({}_{\mathrm{t}}\) = 1000 GeV.

In order to achieve such performance, a highly sophisticated alignment system is required. Provided that the chamber displacements are not too large (below 5mm in translation and 5 mrad in rotation), a system based on projective light beams connecting the chamber corners can in principle provide a correction to the observed muon track sagitta with a precision better than 30 \(\upmu\)m [3]. Nevertheless, this correction can be affected by badly controlled systematic effects like local temperature gradients, unexpected mispositioning of the optical sensors on the chambers or uncontrolled chamber deformations. Given the cost of the whole muon spectrometer (which includes the toroid magnets), we think that a direct calibration using tracks of known momentum is necessary. This absolute alignment, even if it is limited to the barrel part, would also serve as a cross-check of the alignment with light rays.

## 2 How to Get Absolute Alignment?

### Data with 0-field

At a luminosity L=10\({}^{33}\).cm-2.s-1, the rate of muons with P\(>\)20GeV is about 0.1 Hz.m-2 on the first layer of barrel chambers. In principle, tracks with known curvature (e.g. without magnetic field) can be used for the alignment of a projective tower of chambers. At 20 GeV, the rms. of the sagitta distribution induced by multiple scattering is of the order of 400 \(\upmu\)m. Therefore, a set of 400 straight tracks is equivalent for the alignment to a light ray of the alignment system. Collecting this number of tracks over 0.1 m2 can be achieved in a 10h run with field off. The selection of high momentum muons would require the use of the inner detector.

Unfortunately, as the magnet cryostat will move when the current is switched on, these data cannot be used for the calibration with field on (nevertheless, they will be useful for the calibration of the optical sensor positions on the chambers).

### Extrapolation from central detector

For muons with momenta in the 20 GeV range, the momentum is also measured in the inner detector with a comparable precision as in the muon spectrometer. Unfortunately, the extrapolation requires the precise knowledge of the energy loss in the calorimeter and the solenoid return yoke (of the order of 3 GeV). For a sagitta calibration at the 30 \(\upmu\)m level, the average energy loss would have to be known with a precision better than 30 MeV in absolute. With the present knowledge of the muon energy loss in the various materials in the calorimeters, this level of accuracy seems out of reach. Moreover, a difference between the energy loss of positive and negative muons of that order is far from being excluded. Such a difference would lead directly to a systematic shift in the muon spectrometer calibration.

2.3. Calibration using \(\mathrm{Z^{0}\to 2\ \upmu}\) events

Although certainly very useful at the end, the available statistics of such events is clearly too low (a few Hz over the whole detector at L=10\({}^{33}\).cm-2.s-1) to calibrate individual towers, given the large number of degrees of freedom required to describe the tower geometry.

2.4. A dedicated device for the absolute alignment

It appears that the availability of muon tracks with very well calibrated momentum (in average: 1% for 20 GeV muons) requires the use of a small dedicated spectrometer. This device could be used either for a direct calibration of the individual towers by comparison of the momenta measured in the small and the large spectrometers, or quasi equivalently by giving to calibrated muons tracks the same role as to the light rays of the alignment system. If the resolution of this device is better than the one of the large spectrometer for \(\mathrm{P_{t}}\)=20GeV, a sagitta calibration at the level of 20 \(\upmu\)m requires about 400 muons with \(\mathrm{P_{t}}\)\(>\)=20GeV. With a small spectrometer cross-section of 0.06 m\({}^{2}\) this corresponds to 20h of regular data taking at L=10\({}^{33}\).cm-2.s-1. As only one tower can be calibrated at a time, the ATLAS barrel spectrometer would be calibrated in one or two weeks provided that each sector contains its own calibrating spectrometer. One should notice that in contrast with the field off runs, this calibration could run in parallel with the regular data taking (except that all the high \(\mathrm{P_{t}}\) muons of the calibrated tower have to be available for off-line analysis).

As this spectrometer is supposed to work in parallel, it has to be light and transparent to muons, small and mobile to be able to travel along a sector in between two toroid coils and in the free space left between two layers of chambers. Finally the cost will be a crucial issue. It depends on the number of such individual devices needed for the calibration of the whole ATLAS spectrometer. Ideally, one needs one calibrating spectrometer per toroid sector. In practice, in the two sectors that are impaired by the inner detector feet, it is impossible to implement this moving device so that 6 is the maximum number. With only one (or two for cross-checks) spectrometer, one sector of the ATLAS spectrometer can be properly calibrated. A comparison with the inner detector measurement in this sector would provide with a great accuracy the effective difference between the momenta measured before and after the calorimeter/return yoke. Then, provided that the azimuthal homogeneity of the inner detector calibration is controlled at the 1 % level when moving from one sector to the others and that the azimuthal distribution of matter in the calorimeters is controlled at the per cent level (1 cm Fe equivalent), the calibration of one sector can be propagated in the others with the help of the inner detector. These requirements are the basis to a decision on the number of calibrating spectrometers.

3. GENERALITIES

3.1. Aim

To get an absolute alignment of the \(\upmu\)-chambers, we propose to build a silicon tracker, MUST, able to locally measure muon momentum simultaneously with the \(\upmu\)-spectrometer. By comparing these two independent measurements, performed in the same field, one can check and correct the alignment constants, provided that the internal calibration of MUST is known with sufficient accuracy.

3.2. Principles

In the toroidal field of the ATLAS spectrometer, the trajectory of the muon is, in a first approximation, contained in a plane, and the momentum measurement turn out to be a measurement of the track curvature in this plane. Therefore, by measuring the co-ordinates of at least three points in this plane, one can compute the sagitta of the track, and the muon momentum. (Fig.3-1).

Fig. 3-1.

In practice, the r-coordinates of points'will be fixed by mechanics, and only one co-ordinate per point is needed. With the notation of figure 3-1, and in a constant magnetic field B, the track momentum p is given by:

\[\mathrm{p}\approx\frac{\mathrm{qB}}{8}\cdot\frac{\mathrm{L}^{2}}{\mathrm{s}}\]

where s, due to small angles, is approximately equal to the sagitta.

However, due to dependence of the B-field on the azimuthal angle, the transverse coordinate must also be measured, albeit with a looser precision (few mm).

3.3. Requirements

The expected contribution of alignment uncertainties to the momentum resolution in the \(\mathrm{\mu}\)-spectrometer is \(\leq\)10 % at 1 TeV. This extrapolates to 2 % at 20 GeV, and sets an upper limit on the required knowledge of the internal calibration of MUST. By an exposure in test beam, a number, at least as good, is easy to reach. Then, the mechanics has to be carefully studied to guarantee the stability of such an alignment.

On the other hand, as we want to operate MUST simultaneously with the \(\mathrm{\mu}\)-spectrometer, it must be as transparent as possible.

The resolution of MUST is not a fundamental parameter, however the better it is, the shorter is the time needed to measure the alignment constants of \(\mathrm{\mu}\)-chambers. In the case of three measurements, we can derive from the previous formula an expression for the resolution:

\[\frac{\delta\mathrm{p}}{\mathrm{p}}\approx\frac{8}{\mathrm{qB}}\cdot\frac{ \delta\mathrm{s}}{\mathrm{L}^{2}}\cdot\mathrm{p}\]

- 4 -This relation shows that the best location for MUST lies near the maximum field, i.e. between super-layer 1 and 2. In this region the maximum available clearance is 1.40 m. Therefore, a reasonable value for L might be 1.20 m. As recalled above (section 1), the total momentum resolution of the \(\mu\)-spectrometer is 2 % at 20 GeV. So, a reasonable aim for MUST is \(\sim\)1 %. With a B value of.57 T (see next section), and p=20 GeV, this leads for \(\delta\)s to:

\[\delta\mathrm{s}\approx 20\ \mathrm{\mu m}\]

and for \(\sigma\), the error on individual measurements \(\mathrm{x_{i}}\) of each point, to:

\[\mathrm{s}=\frac{1}{2}\big{(}\mathrm{x_{i}}+\mathrm{x_{j}}-2\,\mathrm{x_{j}} \big{)}\quad\Rightarrow\quad\delta\mathrm{s}=\sqrt{\frac{3}{2}}\cdot\sigma \quad\Rightarrow\quad\sigma\approx 15\mathrm{\mu m}\]

The same formula implies that the internal alignment of MUST has to be known at a 1 \(\mu\)m level to keep the contribution of this systematic error near 1 %.

Finally, to explore the full domain covered by the barrel \(\mu\)-chambers, MUST has to be movable, and able to point towards the interaction point.

## 4 A Simplified Simulation

### Program description and limitations

In order to optimise the parameters of MUST, a very simple Monte-Carlo program was developed to simulate the muon hits in the detector. For this preliminary estimate, the field was assumed to be constant and the multiple scattering was neglected and will be considered latter (section 4-2-2). With these conditions, the trajectories are circular, which allows for a very simple reconstruction algorithm.

Fig.4-1 shows the variation of the magnetic field along an axis pointing towards the interaction point, and in the regions where MUST can be positioned. Depending on the z-position of MUST, hence its orientation, the intercepted regions in the toroidal field have variable extension in r. Curves drawn for three positions, show less than 5 % variations, so that a constant value of.57 T has been used.

### Results

#### 4.2.1 Resolution with 3 planes

For a detector with 3 planes, as long as multiple scattering is neglected, and for tracks at small angles with respect to the detector axis, one can use the formulae of section 3 for the resolution. With \(\lambda\) the width of the strips, one has:

\[\sigma=\frac{\lambda}{\sqrt{12}}\quad\Rightarrow\quad\frac{\delta\mathrm{p}}{ \mathrm{p}}=\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{\mathrm{qB}}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{\mathrm{L^{2}}} \cdot\mathrm{p}=.0575\,\mathrm{\%\ GeV^{-1}}\cdot\mathrm{p}\]

Fig.4-2 shows the results of Monte-Carlo for L=1.20 m and \(\lambda\)=50 \(\mathrm{\mu m}\). The line corresponds to the above equation.

#### 4.2.2 Multiple scattering effects

The dominant effect of multiple scattering occurs when the muon goes through the central plane, and it affects the last measured point. For a rms. value \(\theta\) of the scattering angle in the central plane, the coordinate of the hit in the third plane has a dispersion with rms. \(\delta\mathrm{x}\):

\[\delta\mathrm{x}\approx\theta.\mathrm{L}\ /\ 2\]In the table below, we give values of \(\delta\)x for two hypotheses on material thickness, and 20 GeV muons:

1. 300 \(\mu\)m: this is the minimum (the thickness of 1 silicon crystal)

2. 600 \(\mu\)m: more realistic, it includes some supports....

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(\varepsilon\) (\(\mu\)m) & 0 (\(\mu\)rad) & \(\delta\)x (\(\mu\)m) \\ \hline
300 & 30 & 18 \\ \hline
400 & 35 & 21 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

These numbers give a contribution of 9 \(\mu\)m (10.5 \(\mu\)m) to \(\delta\)s. This is to be compared with the 17 \(\mu\)m coming from the spatial resolution. Thus, the multiple scattering effect is smaller, but not completely negligible. The two contributions are plotted in Fig.4-3. At 20 GeV, the resolution is 1.35 %.

To gain on the total resolution, the spatial one must be improved. As the dimension for L is limited by geometrical constraints, and for \(\lambda\) by electronic ones, we have examined the possibility of having a fourth plane.

#### 4.2.3 Resolution with 4 planes

Several distributions of planes along the MUST axis can be considered.

With four equally spaced planes, the resolution is not significantly improved with respect to the 3-plane case. This results from the fact that the sagitta is measured away from where it is maximum.

Two planes in the centre, as close as possible (\(<\) 1 mm), and shifted by \(\lambda\)/2 is a more attractive arrangement. In some sense, this is equivalent to three planes, the central plane having a pitch divided by 2. This implies an improvement in the spatial resolution, but a part of this gain is eaten by the bigger multiple scattering effect (see Fig.4-4).

With this configuration, the resolution is 1.25 % at 20 GeV (Fig.4-5).

#### 4.3. Summary

A detector built with four sensitive planes is able to achieve the 1% level in momentum resolution at 20 GeV, provided that:

* two planes are placed in the central position as close as possible and shifted by half the pitch.
* the distance between external planes is at least 1.20 m.
* the read-out pitch is 50 \(\mu\)m.

A detector with 3 planes can approach the same performance.

These results lead to the proposed design for MUST.

## 5 Proposed Design

### Sensitive planes

The sensitive planes are formed by a mosaic of silicon crystals.

The basic element is a silicon crystal \(\sim\)6 x 6 cm\({}^{2}\), 300 \(\mu\)m thick, with 1024 strips of 50 \(\mu\)m width. Four crystals are glued on a ceramic (or glass,...) support, forming a ladder. The successive strips are bonded. Thus, a ladder is equivalent to a detector with 1024 strips 24 cm long, at 50 \(\mu\)m pitch.(Fig.5-1)

Finally, four ladders are glued on a frame to form a square detector 24 x 24 cm\({}^{2}\) with 4096 channels. The same frame will receive the front-end electronics. With this area the ex pected counting rate for muons above 20 GeV is 20 muons per hour, at luminosity L=10\({}^{33}\).cm-2.s-1.

All the gluing is done under microscope, giving a positioning precision of the order of 2 \(\mu\)m.

The last step consists in inserting these delicate objects in aluminium flanges (see exploded view 5-2).

5.2. Trigger planes

As stated in section 3-2, we also need a measurement in azimuth. This will be done by two hodoscopes made of scintillator bars of section 5x5 mm2, and located before (after) the first (last) sensitive plane. Their read-out can be done with APD's.

Signals given by muons going through these planes will also be used to trigger the read-out process.

5.3. Mechanics

The mechanical structure has two functions:

* Ensure the spacing and parallelism of strips between planes.
* Ensure the rigidity of the full system (\(\sim\)1 \(\mu\)m stability required).

In our design these two functions are separately fulfilled.

The flanges are held together by an aluminium tubular structure. (Fig.5-2). The two external ones are equipped with small devices allowing a fine tuning of the strip orientation.

Two aluminium honeycomb cylinders, which provide the rigidity, are screwed on the central flange, and hold the other flanges. They also support the trigger planes.

Calculations for an aluminium honeycomb structure 15 mm thick, with.5 mm skins, show that the bending at the end of the tube is less than 0.2 \(\mu\)m in the horizontal position. This achieve a sufficient stability, but mechanically the successive planes are only aligned with a 5 \(\mu\)m precision. Therefore, to go down to the required 1 \(\mu\)m, a calibration in a beam test is needed.

This required precision implies also tight constraints in the temperature gradients. This explains the choice of aluminium for the structure instead of carbon fibre for instance.

For the displacements, we foresee a motorised wagon rolling on rails fixed on the voussoirs of the toroid. A rotation is also possible to allow a pointing of MUST towards the interaction point.

A set of technical drawings are added as Figs 5-3,4,5.

5.4. Electronics

For the position resolution required, and with the pitch chosen, knowledge of the exact position of hits in the strips is not necessary; the strip number is sufficient. Therefore the digitisation can occur very early, and a front-end electronic channel would consist of a charge amplifier-filter followed by a discriminator.

The heat dissipated by the electronics must be evacuated by a cooling system, to avoid variations in the strip position due to thermal effects.

5.5. Slow-control

In addition to the remote control of motors, and safety during displacements, a slow-control system will have to monitor temperatures in MUST, and Hall probes will measure the magnetic field in-situ.

6. COST & SCHEDULE

As discussed in section 2-4 the ideal number of MUST is 8: i.e. one per octant. But, in the present design of the toroid, only 6 positions are accessible.

For reason of costs, we can imagine a staged solution with only 2 detectors that we can move around. The following table gives prices for 2 MUST + 6 equipped positions for movements (in French francs).

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \cline{2-3} \multicolumn{1}{c|}{} & FF & \\ \hline Mechanics & 410 & 11,47\% \\ Mock-up & 150 & 4,20\% \\ Wagon & 610 & 17,07\% \\ Tools & 350 & 9,80\% \\ Slow control & 368 & 10,30\% \\ Sensors+components & 207 & 5,79\% \\ Silicon+supports & 858 & 24,01\% \\ Electronics & 560 & 15,67\% \\ Scintillators & 60 & 1,68\% \\ \hline  & 3 573 & 100,00\% \\ Contingencies & 357 & \\ TOTAL & 3 930 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

This prices do not include prototype development, nor internal manpower.

A more detailed table can be found at the end of this note, as well as a schedule for the mounting of two detectors MUST.

7. CONCLUSION

To obtain an absolute in-situ alignment of muon chambers using muon tracks, we propose the construction of 2 (6) mobile silicon trackers.

The particular attention paid to the mechanical design allows to keep the effect of systematic errors below 1%. The choice of parameters gives a resolution of the order of 1 % at 20 GeV. With these properties, we can obtain a sagitta calibration at the level of 20 \(\upmu\)m.
