The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN collected a data set of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with an integrated luminosity of 6 pb\({}^{-1}\) during June 2015. Kinematic distributions are presented for selected data samples in regions dominated by either the single-lepton or dilepton \(t\bar{t}\) decay modes. Clear evidence for the production of top-quark pairs is observed in both the single lepton and dilepton channels.

## 1 Introduction

The large production cross-section of top quark pairs (\(t\bar{t}\)) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV means that samples enriched with top quarks may be selected and distinguished from background processes, even with a relatively small amount of integrated luminosity. This note presents kinematic distributions of events that were selected from the first \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV proton-proton collisions recorded at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by the ATLAS detector [1], using selection criteria designed to select \(t\bar{t}\) events in either the dilepton or single lepton decay mode. In all distributions presented in this note, the expectations obtained from Monte Carlo (MC) simulation are scaled by a constant factor such that the total predicted number of signal and background events equals that observed in data. A description of the reconstructed objects used in this note is presented in section 2, followed by a discussion of the data sample and MC simulation that is used in section 3. A description of the dilepton selection and the single lepton selection is presented in sections 4 and 5, respectively. Finally, a brief summary is presented in section 6.

## 2 Object Selection

Wherever possible, the same object identification is used for both the single lepton and dilepton analyses. Small differences are necessary in some objects in order to account for the different background processes in each channel.

### Electrons

Electron candidates are selected using a multivariate identification algorithm, based on input from inner detector (ID) tracks and associated energy deposits in the electromagnetic calorimeter (ECal) [2; 3]. For the dilepton channel, the identification requirements are selected to provide high efficiency and good rejection of fake and non-prompt electrons. For the single lepton channel, the identification requirements are tighter in order to better suppress contributions from fake and non-prompt electrons. Electrons are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and pseudorapidity of \(|\eta|<2.47\), where the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the electron is calculated from both the energy in the calorimeter and the track direction. Candidates with calorimeter clusters falling within the transition region between the barrel and end-cap of the ECal, \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\), are excluded. Isolation requirements, based on both ID tracks and ECal energy deposits, are used to reduce the background from fake and non-prompt electrons. For ID tracks, the sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all tracks, excluding the track associated to the electron, in a variable cone size around the lepton, are used for the isolation. The size of the cone scales with the electron \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) such that the higher the electron's \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), the smaller the size of the cone. For ECal energy deposits, the sum of the energy in topological clusters not directly associated to the electron in a cone of fixed size around the electron are used for the isolation discriminant. Variable isolation requirements are imposed such that the requirements are 85% efficient at lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=25\) GeV and 99% efficient at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=60\) GeV, where efficiency is measured in simulated events.

### Muons

Muon candidates are selected by matching tracks from the muon spectrometer to tracks from the ID [4]. Additional quality criteria are applied to reduce the contributions from fake and non-prompt muons. Both the dilepton and the single lepton channels use the same quality criteria, which provide high selection efficiency and good fake and non-prompt muon rejection. Muon candidates are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and pseudorapidity of \(|\eta|<2.5\). In addition, the candidates are required to be isolated from energy in the calorimeter and from tracks in the ID using the same variables as for the electron candidates, with the same efficiency performance when measured using \(t\bar{t}\) simulated events.

### Jets

Jets are reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{T}\) algorithm [5] with a radius parameter of \(R=0.4\) using calorimeter energy clusters calibrated to the electromagnetic energy scale. Jets are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\). A multivariate jet-vertex-tagger (JVT) [6] is used to reject jets from pileup interactions.

The energy scale corrections for the jets are derived using MC simulations. These MC simulations describe the individual changes in detector and data taking conditions that the ATLAS detector has experienced in the transition from the 2012 to the 2015 data-taking period [7].

Jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<50\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.4\) are required to be identified as coming from the primary vertex1 using the JVT discriminant. Jets are identified as originating from \(b\)-quarks using a multivariate discriminant, MV2c, which uses impact parameter and secondary vertex information. The chosen MV2c working point corresponds to an average \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 77% for \(b\)-jets in simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events.

Footnote 1: The primary vertex is defined as the vertex with the highest \(\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}\) of tracks associated to it.

### Missing Transverse Momentum

Missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) is reconstructed using calibrated electrons, muons and jets. Electrons and muons used in the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) calculation are required to satisfy the object selections described above. The contribution to the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) from energy not associated with electrons, muons or jets is computed using tracks associated to the primary vertex.

### Removal of Overlapping Objects

The following procedure is used to remove objects overlapping with one another in the detector:

1. Electrons that share a track with a muon are removed.
2. The closest jet to each electron is removed if the \(\Delta R(e,\mathrm{jet})<0.2\). This removes duplicate "electron-jets", as the jet reconstruction algorithm reconstructs all electron energy deposits as jets.
3. Electrons with \(\Delta R(e,\mathrm{jet})<0.4\) are removed in order to suppress events where the energy from a nearby jet has contaminated the electron energy measurement.

4. Jets with fewer than three tracks are removed if they are within \(\Delta R(\mu,\mathrm{jet})<0.4\) as these are likely to be caused by muon energy deposits in the calorimeter.
5. Muons with \(\Delta R(\mu,\mathrm{jet})<0.4\) to any jet with more than three tracks are removed in order to suppress muons originating from heavy-flavour decays.

## 3 Data and Monte Carlo Samples

The figures in this document use a combination of data, recorded by the ATLAS detector, and MC simulation from various MC generators.

### Data Sample

The figures in this note show data collected by the ATLAS detector on the 13th and 14th of June 2015 at a centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The recorded data correspond to an integrated luminosity of approximately 6 pb\({}^{-1}\). The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity is \(\pm 9\%\). It is derived, following a methodology similar to that detailed in Ref. [8], from a preliminary calibration of the luminosity scale using a pair of x-y beam-separation scans performed in June 2015. Only data collected with all detector systems operational are used. Events are selected using either a single electron or single muon trigger, with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds of 17 GeV and 14 GeV, respectively. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirements on electrons and muons ensure that the selection is well within the efficiency plateau for these triggers. There are no isolation requirements on the triggers used to select events.

### Monte Carlo Samples

For top quark production processes (\(t\bar{t}\) and single top), the Powheg Box[9, 10, 11] generator is used, interfaced to Pythia 6[12] for the simulation of the parton density functions and parton shower and fragmentation. The non-perturbative effects are modelled using the Perugia 2012C (P2011C) underlying-event tune and the top-quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV. Events containing \(W\) or \(Z\) bosons with associated jets are also simulated using Powheg but interfaced to Pythia 8[13]. Diboson processes (\(WW\), \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\)) are simulated using the Sherpa generator[14]. All generated samples are passed through Geant 4[15] for full simulation of the ATLAS detector and reconstructed in the same manner as the real ATLAS data. Pileup is simulated by overlaying inelastic proton-proton interactions simulated with Pythia 8. All MC samples are normalised to the Standard Model prediction for the sample process before being scaled by a constant factor such that the total predicted number of signal and background events equals that observed in data.

### 4 Dilepton Channel

The dilepton event selection is split into two sub-channels: events with two electrons or two muons (same-flavour events) and those with one electron and one muon (\(e\mu\) events). For each sub-channel a different selection is used. In both channels, the estimation of fake and non-prompt leptons is derived from the MC truth information.

### Same-Flavour Selection

Same-flavour dilepton events are selected by requiring exactly two leptons with the same flavour (either electrons or muons) that have oppositely-signed electric charge. In addition, the invariant mass of the dilepton pair must be separated by at least 10 GeV from the \(Z\)-boson mass and the event must contain at least 30 GeV of missing transverse momentum. These criteria remove the majority of the background events originating from \(Z\)-boson production in association with extra jets. Finally, there must be at least one \(b\)-tagged jet present in the event. After all selections, the purity of the sample is very high, with 85% of expected events originating from the \(t\bar{t}\) process. In the \(ee\) channel, 14 events are observed in the data, while in the \(\mu\mu\) channel 19 events are observed. Figure 1 shows the kinematic observables in the same-flavour dilepton selection in the combined \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels. Figure 1(a) shows the jet multiplicity in events passing the selection, while Fig. 1(b) shows the number of \(b\)-tagged jets, before requiring that each event contains at least one \(b\)-tagged jet. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions of all leptons (two entries per event) and all \(b\)-tagged jets are shown in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 1(d), respectively. The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution, without the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) requirement, is shown in figure Fig. 1(e). Finally, the lowest average invariant mass of the lepton and \(b\)-jet, \(m_{lb}\), is shown in Fig. 1(f). This observable is constructed by first pairing the leptons with either the two highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(b\)-tagged jets or, in events with only one tagged jet, the \(b\)-tagged jet and the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) non-tagged jet. The average invariant mass is then calculated from the two lepton-jet pairs. Both possible permutations of lepton-jets are considered and the permutation that gives the smallest average invariant mass of both lepton-jet pairs is taken as the observable. In \(t\bar{t}\) events, this observable peaks below the top-quark mass, but background processes have no such kinematic limit. The data are well modelled by the simulation and the non-\(t\bar{t}\) background is expected to be small.

### \(e\mu\) Selection

Events in the \(e\mu\) channel are selected by requiring exactly one electron and one muon that have oppositely-signed electric charge. No requirements are made on the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) or the invariant mass of the dilepton pair, but there must be at least one \(b\)-tagged jet present. This selection closely follows the same selection that was used in previous ATLAS cross-section results in the same channel [16]. The purity of the sample after \(e\mu\) selection is very high, with approximately 90% of expected events originating from \(t\bar{t}\). Fifty-one events are observed in the data. Figure 2 shows the kinematic observables in the \(e\mu\) dilepton selection. Figure 2(a) shows the jet multiplicity in events passing the selection, while Fig. 2(b) shows the number of \(b\)-tagged jets, before requiring that each event contains at least one \(b\)-tagged jet. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions of the electrons and muons passing the selection are shown in Fig. 2(c) and Fig. 2(d), respectively. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all \(b\)-tagged jets are shown in figure Fig. 2(e). Finally, the lowest average invariant mass of the lepton and \(b\)-tagged jet, \(m_{lb}\), is shown in Figure Fig. 2(f). As in the same-flavour dilepton channels, the data is seen to be well described by the simulation.

Figure 1: Kinematic distributions in the same–flavour dilepton selection. For the \(b\)–jet multiplicity distribution (b) the requirement of at least one \(b\)–tagged jet has been removed. For the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution (e) the requirement of at least 30 GeV has been removed. For the lowest average lepton-\(b\)–tagged jet invariant mass (f), an additional requirement of at least two jets has been applied, in addition to the one or more \(b\)–tagged jet requirement. In all figures, the highest bin also contains events that are above the \(x\)–axis range.

Figure 2: Kinematic distributions in the \(e\mu\) dilepton selection. Events are selected with an electron-muon pair and at least one \(b\)–tagged jet. The number of jets (a) and number of \(b\)-tagged jets (b) do not include the at least one jet requirement. For the lowest average lepton-\(b\)–tagged jet invariant mass (f), an additional requirement of at least two jets has been applied. In all figures, the highest bin also contains events that are above the \(x\)–axis range.

## 5 Single Lepton Channel

To select \(t\bar{t}\) events in which one \(W\) boson decays to a electron or muon and a neutrino, while the other \(W\) boson decays to two quarks, events are required to have exactly one electron or muon, and at least four jets. To select a high purity sample of \(t\bar{t}\) events, at least two of the jets are required to be \(b\)-tagged. Finally, to remove background events due to non-prompt leptons events with one electron are required to have either \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>40\) GeV or \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}>50\) GeV,2 while events with one muon are required to have \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}>60\) GeV. These requirements select a sample of \(t\bar{t}\) events with a purity of \(\approx 90\%\). After applying these selection criteria, the only remaining backgrounds with a significant contribution are single top quark events and events with fake and non-prompt leptons. In the data sample, 139 events are selected containing one electron, while 120 events are selected containing one muon.

Footnote 2: The transverse mass of the \(W\) boson \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) is defined as \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}=\sqrt{2p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}( 1-\cos(\phi^{\ell}-\phi^{E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}}))}\)

The estimation of fake and non-prompt leptons is performed using the data-driven matrix method [17].

In the following plots the \(e\)+jets and \(\mu\)+jets channels have been combined into a single \(\ell\)+jets sample. Figures 3(a), 3(b) and 3(c) show the transverse momenta of the selected lepton, the jets and the \(b\)-tagged jets, respectively, in events that pass either the electron or muon selections described above. The number of jets per event is shown in Figure 3(d).

Figures 3(e) and 3(f) show \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) and \(m_{jjb}\), respectively. The procedure to construct \(m_{jjb}\) follows that in Ref. [18]. The two highest-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(b\)-tagged jets are taken as the two \(b\)-tagged jets coming from the decay of the top quarks. The \(\Delta R\) between each of the \(b\)-tagged jets and the selected lepton is computed and the \(b\)-tagged jet with the largest \(\Delta R\) with respect to the lepton is identified as the \(b\)-tagged jet from the hadronically decaying top quark. The quantity \(m_{jjb}\) is the invariant mass of this \(b\)-tagged jet and the two highest-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets that are not one of the two \(b\)-tagged jets already used in this calculation.

In all distributions the data are well described by the prediction. The \(m_{jjb}\) distribution peaks close to the top-quark mass in both data and simulation.

## 6 Conclusion

The data collected by ATLAS during June 2015 provide clear evidence for the production of top-quark pairs in both the single lepton and dilepton channels in just 6 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. Tight selection criteria are applied to suppress background processes and kinematic distributions are presented. Within the limited data statistics available, the shapes of the kinematic distributions appear to be well modelled.
