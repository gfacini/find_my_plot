###### Abstract:

New all-degenerate charged and neutral heavy leptons are a feature of a number of theories of physics beyond the Standard Model. The prospects for detecting these at the Large Hadron Collider using a time-of- right technique are considered, along with any cosmological or experimental constraints on their masses. Based on a discovery criterion of 10 detected exotic leptons we conclude that, with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb \({}^{-1}\), it should be possible to detect such leptons provided their masses are less than 950 GeV. It should also be possible to use the angular distribution of the produced particles to distinguish these exotic leptons from supersymmetric scalar leptons, at a better than 90% confidence level, for masses up to 580 GeV.

## 1 Introduction

One of the most widely considered possibilities for new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM ) is supersymmetry (SUSY) [1, 2]. Supersymmetry is theoretically attractive and is able to solve some of the problems faced when trying to understand how fundamental models at higher energy scales are consistent with what is seen by experiments at low energy scales. SUSY solves the so-called hierarchy problem and improves the unification of the three gauge couplings at a higher energy scale.

The simplest possible SUSY extension of the Standard Model is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM ). The model has a second Higgs scalar doublet and for each SM particle there is an associated superpartner.

We know that supersymmetry is broken because we do not see associated superpartners with the same masses as the known particles. It has long been known that a viable way to break supersymmetry is in a hidden sector - the SUSY breaking in a particular model is then transmitted to the Voutside world" by same means (usually gravitational or gauge interactions).

One scenario motivated by string theory is that of an intermediate scale [3, 4]. This is a result of the realisation that, if a fundamental theory includes higher dimensional objects like D-branes, the fundamental scale is effectively a free parameter anddoes not have to be close to the Planck scale as previously thought. The fundamental scale could, in theory, be as low as experimental limits allow (i.e. 1 TeV ).

In the type of model being considered here, gauge coupling unification is assumed to occur at an intermediate scale. \(\langle\)Intermediate" refers to an energy scale ( \(~{}10^{11}~{}\)GeV ) which is the geometric mean of the weak and Planck energy scales. This choice is motivated by the scale of supersymmetry breaking in hidden sector, gravity mediated, scenarios. One of the strongest arguments supporting the intermediate string scale scenario is that of the axion decay constant [4]. The axion field is the Goldstone mode of a chiral symmetry introduced to the Standard Model to solve the strong Charge Parity problem (which gives an unnaturally small bound on one of the parameters) [7]. A astrophysical and cosmological bounds constrain the axion decay constant to be in the approximate energy range \(10^{9}\) [\(10^{12}~{}\)GeV. The intermediate scale is also consistent with some neutrino mass mechanisms, and is favoured by certain cosmological in ation models. High energy cosmic ray observations and certain non-thermal dark matter candidates are also supporting arguments for the intermediate energy scale.

Various intermediate scale models are motivated from different string models in references [3(6)]. Some phenomenological constraints on intermediate scale models are provided by [8], and \(g~{}~{}~{}2\) constraints have also been discussed [9, 10].

One of the ways of achieving this intermediate scale unification is to include new leptons as part of extra supermultiplets added to the MSSM. Although this choice is not unique, the extra leptons in [8] are three vector-like copies of left-handed SU (2) doublets (\(L^{0},L^{0}\)) and two right-handed singlets (\(E^{0}E^{0}\)).

By assumption there are no new Yukawa couplings for the model in [8]. This means that the lightest heavy lepton is stable and the others will decay into it. This is possible because the tree-level mass degeneracy of the charged and neutral leptons will be destroyed by electroweak symmetry breaking.

As in the MSSM, the renormalisation group equations can be used to determine the spectrum of supersymmetric particles which will have phenomenological implications for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). However the characteristic feature of this model is the new leptons and so this work concentrates on the phenomenology due to the extra leptons themselves. More specially we consider whether it will be possible to detect them at the LHC, and for what range of masses.

Previous limits on the masses of any new quasi-stable charged leptons have been determined by the energy available for particle production in lepton colliders. The gauge unification arguments in intermediate scale models can that the extra leptons are expected to have masses in the TeV range. At the LHC enough energy should be available to produce and detect these exotic heavy charged leptons.

In this paper we first review the existing cosmological and experimental limits on heavy particles to ensure that the leptons incorporated in this intermediate scale model are not ruled out. In section 3 we describe the changes to the HERWIG MonteCarb event generator to take account of these new heavy leptons. Then we consider the detection of these leptons at the LHC using a time-of- light" technique. Heavy leptons will arrive at the detector significantly later than relativistic particles - in section 4 the prospects of using this time delay as a method of detection are studied for a range of masses. We also consider how to distinguish such leptons from scalar leptons on the basis of their different angular distributions. Our results are presented in section 5.

## 2 Cosmological and Experimental Constraints

The mass degeneracy of the charged and neutral leptons will be broken by radiative corrections. The electromagnetic self-energy correction for the charged lepton ensures that its mass will be greater than that of the neutral lepton [11]. This means that the charged lepton can decay to its neutral partner producing either a real or virtual W, depending on the mass difference. The neutral heavy lepton can be assumed to be totally stable (i.e. it has a lifetime orders of magnitude longer than that of the universe) because of the assumption that there are no new Yukawa couplings.

There are a number of cosmological and experimental limits on leptons (particularly charged leptons) as a function of both mass and lifetime:

The relic abundance of the leptons (calculated from the self-annihilation cross section) must not (over-close" the universe i.e. provide more than the critical energy density ( \(10^{5}\) GeV cm\({}^{3}\)) which is presumed to be accounted for by Dark Matter [12, 13].

A stable, charged lepton must have a low enough relic abundance for it not to have been detected in searches for exotic heavy isotopes in ordinary matter (see e.g. [14]).

The massive lepton and any decays it may have must not significantly a ect nucleosynthesis or the synthesised elemental abundances [15, 16].

If the lepton decays before the recombination era (at \(10^{2}\) s) it must not distort the cosmic microwave background radiation [15].

If the lepton has a longer lifetime it must not contradict the limits from gamma-ray and neutrino background observations [17, 18].

The mass and lifetime of the new leptons must not be such that they would have been detected in a previous collider experiment [19].

Most of these limits are summarised in [20] and no constraints on charged leptons are found for lifetimes less than \(10^{6}\) s, even for masses up to the TeV scale. The

## 4 Implementation

### Modifications to HERWIG 6.3

The above formulae were incorporated into a new subroutine added to HERWIG 6.3 together with new particle entries (for the heavy leptons) and new process codes (IPROCs) for the new processes.

Increasing them ass of the new leptons allowed the variation of cross section with mass to be studied - the mass was varied over a range from of order the top quark mass to a maximum of order 1 TeV. The lifetimes of the charged leptons produced were set to 1 so that the number of decays occurring inside the detector will be negligible.

The angular distribution of the produced leptons was studied over the same mass range to investigate the possibility of distinguishing heavy leptons from MSSM sleptons.

### Time-of-flight Technique

Our main aim was to consider the possible detection of charged heavy leptons at the LHC and for what mass ranges this might be practical. This work refers specifically to the technical specifications of the ATLAS detector [25]. However we believe similar results will be obtained for the CMS experiment [28].

The method used was a time-of- light technique as discussed in ref. [29]. This method utilises the fact that, when compared to relativistic particles, there is a considerable time delay for heavy particles to reach themon system. Heavy charged leptons like those being considered in this work will be detected in both the central tracker and the muon chambers, and from the measured momentum and time delay it is possible to reconstruct the mass.

In perfections in the time and momentum resolutions will cause a spread of the mass peak. Uncertainty over which bunch crossing a particular detected particle comes from may also provide a background signal (from muons produced in Drell-Yan processes and also from heavy quark decays). Plots from [27] display the behaviour of the processes which are most likely to produce muons which might be identified as heavy leptons. These are reproduced in figures 1 and 2.

The studies presented here do not attempt to model the background, which it is not thought will be significant (there is no physics" background, only "detector" background as discussed above), and use a simple cut (as in [29]) on the range of time delays allowed.

The calculation of a reconstructed mass from the time delay \(t\) and momentum is straightforward. For a lepton hitting the radial part of the muon spectrometer, the time delay with respect to a relativistic ( \(=\frac{\nu}{c}=1\)) particle is given byt= \(\frac{r}{P_{T}}\) (E \(\quad\)p); (4.1)

where \(r\) is the radius of the outer layer of the muon system, \(P_{T}\) the transverse momentum, and E and p the total energy and momentum respectively. Substituting for E in the energy-momentum invariant \(E^{2}\quad p^{2}=m^{2}\) gives the result

\[m^{2}=p^{2}\quad\frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}}\quad 1\ =\ \frac{P_{T}t}{r}\quad 2p+\frac{P_{T}t}{r}\quad: \tag{4.2}\]

It is also necessary to check for occasions when the lepton hits the endcap of the detector by considering the magnitude of \(\frac{P_{T}}{P_{T}}\). The muon system is modelled approximately as a cylinder of radius 10 m and a half-length of 20 m [27]. A pseudo-rapidity cut requiring that \(<\beta\):7j was applied to take account of the region close to the beam where particles cannot be detected.

From the expression (4.2), the time delay and measured momentum for any particle detected in the muon system can be used to calculate the mass. As in [29] the time delay was smeared with a Gaussian (although a width of 0.7 ns [27] rather than 1 ns was used) and a cut on the smeared time delay was applied such that 10 ns \(<\tau<\) 50 ns. Increasing the lower limit on \(t\) would reduce the efficiency but

inprove the mass resolution by removing many of the high leptons for which the time resolution contribution is large. The upper limit eliminates very slow particleswhich lose most of their energy in the calorimeter. An alternative upper limit of 25 ns, reflecting practical concerns, is discussed in section 5.2.

The most important contribution to the momentum uncertainty \(p\) is due to the measurement error on the sagitta (the deviation from a straight line of a charged particle in a magnetic field). \(P_{\rm sag}\) was taken into account by using

\[\frac{P_{\rm sag}}{P^{2}}=11\quad 10\ ^{4}; \tag{4.3}\]

where \(p\) is the total momentum in GeV. The constant in eq. (4.3) was obtained from [25] as an average over the different parts of the ATLAS detector. This expression should be valid near the discovery limit for heavy leptons when multiple scattering is insigni cant - the maximum time delay cut is found to remove most of the low leptons for which multiple scattering would have more effect. However to allow investigations over a full mass range a multiple scattering term ( \(P_{\rm ns}\)) was also incorporated with

\[P_{\rm ms}=2\quad 10\ ^{2}\ \frac{q}{P^{2}+m^{2}}. \tag{4.4}\]

The constant depends on the material distribution in the spectrometer - the above value is given in [30] for the ATLAS muon detector.

The two errors in eqs. (4.3) and (4.4) were taken to be independent and hence combined in quadrature. A third possible contribution to momentum resolution - due to \(\nu\)uctuation in the energy loss in the calorimeter - is neglected as it is always dominated by one of the other terms.

Using the momentum and time resolution as described above we are able to satisfactorily reproduce the mass resolution as a function of \(\tau\) for 101 GeV particles as given in [25].

The efficiency of the muon detection system is approximated to be 85%, independent of the particle momentum [25].

## 5 Results

### Backgrounds

Any detector" background is greatly dependent on the details of the muon detection system. Such a background would come from muons either from the decay of heavy quarks or from Drell-Yan (both these processes have very high cross sections compared to that for heavy lepton production). If timing inadequacies do mean that same of these muons are mistakenly thought to have come from an earlier interaction i.e. they appear to have a large time delay, they could obscure the exotic lepton mass peak. For a background signal to look like a heavy lepton neutral current signal, however, two opposite charge muons would have to be identified at the same time which makes it very unlikely that background could be significant.

To eliminate any possible background from heavy quark decays, a cut requiring the transverse momentum to be greater than 50 GeV was made to produce the plots in section 5.2. Figures 3 and 4 show that a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) cut at 50 GeV should remove most of the muons from bottom quark decay without significantly reducing the exotic heavy lepton signal. It can be seen that as the mass of the exotic heavy lepton increases, the peak in the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) spectrum becomes less well defined and shifts to higher values. Top quark decays can give rise to muons at high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) but the small top cross section, combined with the in probability of mis-identifying two muons, should so to eliminate this source of background.

### Heavy Lepton Mass Peaks

The results presented in this section show the reconstructed mass peaks for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) after the cuts outlined above have been applied.

Figure 3: \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) spectrum for muons produced in b decays.

The possibility of detection at the LHC is found to be entirely cross section limited - the decrease of cross section with increasing lepton mass is shown in figure 5. The fraction of leptons passing the cuts actually slightly increases with mass due to the longer time delays.

Figure 6 for the neutral Drell-Yan process makes it clear that for masses up to about 1 TeV it should be possible to detect new charged heavy leptons at the LHC (particularly if a larger integrated luminosity can be obtained). A discovery criterion of 10 leptons (from 5 events) in them aspeak is found to give a mass limit of 950 GeV for the detection of such leptons using an integrated luminosity of 100 fb [1].

To reduce possible backgrounds the plots are based on events from which both leptons produced passed the cuts imposed.

We note that the long drift times in the muon chambers used by ATLAS allow the recording of events with time delays at arrivalm which greater than the 25 ns beam crossing interval of the LHC [27]. We have assumed a maximum time delay of 50 ns following [29]. However, to correctly associate the delayed track in the muon system with the event recorded in the other detector systems would require a specialised trigger, based, for example, on the presence of high \(p_{T}\) tracks in the inner detector, which would identify the true event time. Without this, the maximum delay time allowable would be 25 ns, and the discovery reach would be reduced to a lepton mass of 800 GeV. The statistical sample available for the angular distribution analysis in section 5.3 would also be reduced by a factor of about 2, depending on the lepton mass.

of integrated luminosity.

Figure 8 shows that it will be possible to rule out scalar leptons at a cone of level of better than 90% up to a mass of 580 GeV. The angular distribution does not change significantly over the mass range of this plot - the decreasing probability of ruling out the scalar hypothesis as the mass increases is mainly because of the decreasing statistics.

## 6 Conclusions

This work was motivated by some of the new models of physics beyond the Standard Model in which the gauge couplings unify at an intermediate energy scale (\(~{}~{}10^{11}~{}\mathrm{GeV}\)). Many of these intermediate scale models include additional leptons added to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model and which are expected to have TeV scale masses.

We conclude that, assuming Standard Model couplings and a long enough lifetime, it should be possible to detect the charged heavy leptons in intermediate scale models up to masses of 950 GeV with 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. Background from this-identified muons should be negligible and can be reduced by the application of a \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{\pm}}^{\pm}\) cut at about 50 GeV. It will be difficult to use the angular distribution of the produced particles to distinguish them from scalar leptons for masses above 580 GeV because the falling cross section limits the available statistics.

The absence of a specialised trigger in the inner detector could reduce the discovery limit to 800 GeV and would reduce the statistics available for the angular distribution analysis.

No present cosmological or experimental limits were found to rule out additional exotic leptons at the masses considered in this work.
