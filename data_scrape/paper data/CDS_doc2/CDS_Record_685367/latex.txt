The discovery potential of ATLAS detector for \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) is discussed for the case of the Higgs production in association with one jet. The detailed simulation of the signal and the backgrounds was carried out. For signal the different approaches are compared which led to a similar results after the choice of the proper cuts and normalization. The \(pp\to\gamma\gamma+jet+X\) background was generated with the exact matrix-elements. The parton-shower, hadronization and detector simulation influence on results was studied. It was found the result dependence with respect to the choice of the parton-showering scale \(Q\) for the background. In any case, for \(m_{H}\)= 115 \(\div\) 140 GeV the signal significance was evaluated about or above 5 for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Introduction

The production of the Higgs in association with large \(p_{T}\) jet can be used to improve the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) signal significance and signal-to-background (S/B) ratio. The specific jet distributions in the \(\gamma\gamma\ +\ \mathrm{jet}\) final state are different for signal and background processes. Promising results have been obtained in the parton-level study [1]. It was shown that, selecting of the jet with \(p_{T}\ >\ 30\) GeV and using the cut on the partonic subprocess energy \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\), the S/B ratio could be significantly improved and the discovery level \(S/\sqrt{B}\) = 5 can be achieved for \(m_{H}\) = 110 \(\div\) 140 GeV for the integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The goal of this study is to reproduce above-described results on particle-level with detector simulation. Some estimates were done in [2] where PYTHIA 5.7 [3] was used to generate the signal and background events. Here the signal events were generated by PYTHIA 6.2 [4]. For the background calculation the events from the \(2\to 3\) subprocesses were generated with exact matrix-elements by CompHEP package [5] and then they were used as an input to PYTHIA 6.2. The detector response was simulated with ATLFAST package [6].

## 2 Selection criteria and cuts

The event selection criteria are similar to the set 2 in the analysis performed in [1]:

* 2 isolated photons with \(p_{T}^{\gamma}>40\) GeV and \(|\eta_{\gamma}|\ <\ 2.5\),
* at least one jet with \(p_{T}^{jet}\ >\ 30\) GeV and \(|\eta_{jet}|\ <\ 4.5\).

The events with one or more photons in region of the electro-magnetic barrel/endcap transition, \(1.42<\ |\eta|\ <1.57\), were rejected.

The \(\gamma\)-jet separation \(\Delta R\ =\ \sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}\ +\ \Delta\eta^{2}}=0.4\) was determined by the photon isolation criteria in ATLFAST.

It has been found in [1] that the background events from the \(gq\to\gamma+\gamma+q\) and \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma+\gamma+g\) subprocesses have a smaller \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) than the signal events from \(gg\to gH\), \(qg\to qH\) and \(q\bar{q}\to gH\) and the cuts on \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) is very useful. On parton-level study one has \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\)= \(M_{\gamma\gamma parton}\). In this study the cut on \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}\) was imposed, where the jet with the largest \(p_{T}\) was selected for the multi-jet final states.

## 3 Signal and background generation

### Signal

The \(2\to 2\) QCD subprocesses \(gg\to gH\), \(qg\to qH\) and \(q\bar{q}\to gH\) are commonly considered as source of the H + jet events with large \(p_{T}\). On the other hand the parton emission from the initial partons in the fusion subprocesses \(gg\to H\) and \(q\bar{q}\to H\) can also produce jets with \(p_{T}<m_{H}\). In PYTHIA 6.2 the parton emission in the \(gg\to H\) fusion process is corrected by the ratio of the matrix-elements square of the \(2\to 2\) processes to the probability of the parton emission, and the shower-generator limit \(Q_{max}=m_{H}\) is replaced by \(Q_{max}=\sqrt{s}\) to extend the \(p_{T}\) range up to \(\sqrt{s}/2\). Note that the other partons from the backwards shower evolution have smaller \(p_{T}\) due to \(p_{T}\)-ordering. The \(gg\to H\) fusion process with the matrix-element corrections (ISUB = 103) can be used for the description H + jet production for all \(p_{T}\) values of jet. In this study both approaches are considered and compared.

The contribution from the process \(q\bar{q}\to gH\) and \(q\bar{q}\to H\) is small and can be neglected.

The H + jet events can be produced also in the WW or ZZ fusion subprocesses \(qq\to qqH\) (ISUB = 123 and 124) and in the Higgs production associated with W, Z (ISUB = 24 and 26) where the vector boson decays into a quark-antiquark pair.

The events were generated by PYTHIA v.6.202 with the default CTEQ 5L parton-distribution set. The same values for \(Br(H\to\gamma\gamma)\) were used as it was done for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel study in [7].

In Fig. 1 the \(p_{T}^{H}\) and \(p_{T}^{jet}\) distributions for the \(gg\to H\) fusion process with the matrix-element corrections are compared with the distributions for the \(gg\to gH\) (ISUB = 113) and \(qg\to qH\) (ISUB = 112) processes with and without parton showering. As usual the cut is imposed on \(\hat{p}_{T}\) to exclude singularity in the \(2\to 2\) processes when the parton showering is on. Here \(\hat{p}_{T}\) is a parton transverse momentum in the rest frame of the hard interaction. The two cases \(\hat{p}_{T}>\) 10 GeV and 20 GeV are considered.

In PYTHIA 6.2 the \(gg\to H\) process with the matrix-element corrections is normalized in order to have the same value for the total cross-section as for the \(gg\to H\) process without corrections. In this study the factor 1.5 is included in order to have the cross-section value for large \(p_{T}^{H}\) the same as for \(2\to 2\) processes, which describe the LO large \(p_{T}\) Higgs production. In fact, though the \(2\to 2\) processes contribute to the NLO total cross-section, the NLO corrections mainly come from soft- and virtual-gluon effects and factorize into K-factor. Note, that the NLO K-factor for \(gg\to H\) is about 1.7 for \(m_{H}\)= 100 \(\div\) 150 GeV [8]. Thus, we have a correct LO behaviour for large \(p_{T}\) and the NLO total cross-section. The NLO corrections are also calculated for large \(p_{T}\) Higgs production and K-factor is about 1.6 [9]. This K-factor is not included here.

There is good agreement between the \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{H}\) cross-sections calculated within the \(gg\to H\) with the matrix-element corrections and \(2\to 2\) approaches for \(p_{T}^{H}>m_{H}\). The \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{jet}\) cross-sections for the \(gg\to H\) with the matrix-element corrections and the \(2\to 2\) processes without showering have about the same values for \(p_{T}^{jet}>\)30 GeV. The \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{jet}\) for the \(2\to 2\) processes with showering has a slightly different \(p_{T}\)-dependence.

The \(2\to 2\) processes approach with parton-showering and \(\hat{p}_{T}>\) 10 GeV overestimates the cross-section for the low \(p_{T}\) range. In this case the part of the cross-section is saturated by the soft \(2\to 2\) interaction. It can be seen from Fig. 2 where we present the \(\hat{p}_{T}\) distribution for events with \(p_{T}^{jet}>\) 30 GeV. The cut \(\hat{p}_{T}>\) 20 GeV provides the rejection of the contribution from the soft interaction.

The \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}\) distributions are shown in Fig. 3. There is a good agreement between the \(gg\to H\) approach and the \(2\to 2\) approach with the cut \(\hat{p}_{T}>\) 20 GeV for \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>\)250 GeV. If \(\hat{p}_{T}>\) 10 GeV, the agreement is better for low values of \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}\). We can compare the \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}\) distribution with the \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) distribution for the \(gg\to Hg\), \(gq\to Hg\) events. The distributions are very similar for \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>\) 250 GeV (see Fig. 3). Fig. 4 shows the same distributions after the cut \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>\) 300 GeV. Some contribution from the low \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) region is noticeable here. In particular, about 20% of the contribution is coming from the \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}<\) 240 GeV region in the case of the \(\hat{p}_{T}>\) 10 GeV cut. The events from the \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}<\) 240 GeV region have the low values of \(\hat{p}_{T}\) and \(p_{T}^{jet}<m_{H}\) (see Fig. 5). This implies that the selected jet is not from the final state of the \(2\to 2\) interaction but is emited from the initial parton. The corresponded Feynman diagram contributes to NLO corrections. There is no ambiguity of the jet selection for the \(gg\to H\) approach with the matrix-element corrections because \(p_{T}\)-ordering of the partons.

### Background

The background consists of the the irreducible background from the reaction \(pp\to\gamma\gamma+jet+X\) and the reducible one from the reactions \(pp\to\gamma+jet+jet+X\) and \(pp\to jet+jet+jet+jet+X\) where one or two jets are misidentified as photons. The reducible background was estimated with PYTHIA 5.7 simulation [2] assuming parametrised photon/jet separation efficiency [7] and consists of about 10 \(\div\) 20% from the irreducible one.

At LO level the irreducible background receives contributions from the \(gq\to\gamma+\gamma+q\) and \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma+\gamma+g\) subprocesses.

For the \(\gamma\gamma\) channel the contribution from the NLO one-loop subprocess \(gg\to\gamma+\gamma\) is same as the contribution from the LO subprocess \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma+\gamma\) because the parton-luminosity is rather low for the \(q\bar{q}\) initial state. For the \(\gamma\gamma+\)jet channel the contribution from the NLO one-loop subprocess \(gg\to\gamma+\gamma+g\) is less than 20% of the LO contributions [10] and can be neglected for this study.

The CompHEP 33.23 package [5] was used for calculation of the matrix-elements for the \(gq\to\gamma+\gamma+q\) and \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma+\gamma+g\) subprocesses and then for generation of \(pp\to\gamma+\gamma+q(g)\) events with weights.

For this study CompHEP was linked with PDFLIB [11]. The CTEQ5 L parton-distribution set and the corresponded \(\alpha_{S}\) was used for the background calculation the same as for the signal generation. The \(Q^{2}\) definition was changed to correspond to the PYTHIA \(Q^{2}\) definition for the \(gg\to(H\to\gamma\gamma)+g\) and \(gq\to(H\to\gamma\gamma)+q\) signal subprocesses \(Q^{2}=0.5M_{\gamma\gamma}^{2}+(p_{T}^{q(g)})^{2}\). The electroweak coupling value was 1/137.036 since the photons are on-shell (the default CompHEP choice is \(\alpha(M_{Z})=1/128.9\)).

The following cuts were imposed on the parton kinematical variables:

* \(p_{T}^{\gamma}>30\) GeV (25 GeV, for \(m_{H}\)= 110 GeV),
* \(p_{T}^{jet}\;>\;20\) GeV,
* \(|\eta_{\gamma}|\;<\;3\),
* \(|\eta_{jet}|\;<\;5\),
* \(\Delta R_{\gamma q(g)}>0.3\),
* \(\Delta R_{\gamma\gamma}>0.3\).

The parton cuts are looser than the cuts for the reconstructed photons and jets because the kinematical variables of photons and jets differ from the kinematical variables of their parent partons after the parton-showering, the hadronization and the detector simulation. The parton cuts were chosen in such a way as to minimize their influence on the kinematical variables distributions for the reconstructed jets and photons and to exclude the singular regions of the parton kinematical variables.

The events with weights from CompHEP were converted to an unweighted event samples and saved on the disk. The parton-showering and the hadronization was generated by PYTHIA 6.202 where the unweighted parton-level events were considered as events from the external process.

To generate events by PYTHIA with external process one needs to set the Q scale for parton-showering. The common choice is the scale, as used in the calculation of parton distribution, i.e. \(Q^{2}=0.5M_{\gamma\gamma}^{2}+(p_{T}^{q(g)})^{2}\). In this case \(p_{T}\) of the jet emitted from the initial parton can be larger than \(p_{T}\) of the jet from the hard subprocess. The more preferablechoice from the point of view of the physical pattern of the process and the LO approximation is \(Q^{2}=(p_{T}^{q(g)})^{2}\). In this case the selected jet with the largest \(p_{T}\) always results from the hard subprocess and there is no double counting of Feynman diagrams. The three cases were considered here to study the parton-shower influence on the results: 1) \(Q^{2}=(p_{T}^{q(g)})^{2}\), 2) \(Q^{2}=0.5M_{\gamma\gamma}^{2}+(p_{T}^{q(g)})^{2}\) and 3) \(Q^{2}=M_{\gamma\gamma}^{2}+2(p_{T}^{q(g)})^{2}\).

The background cross-section was averaged on \(M_{\gamma\gamma}\) within the \(m_{H}\pm 5\ GeV\) interval.

Fig. 6\(\div 13\) show the kinematical variables distributions for the reconstructed photons and jet in comparison with the corresponded kinematical variables distributions for photons and quark (gluon) in final state of the underlaying parton subprocess after applying the event selection criteria and before and after the \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>300\) GeV cut in the case \(m_{H}\)= 120 GeV. One can see that the parton variables were generated in the appropriate ranges and the contribution from the region outside this ranges is small.

As it seen from Fig. 12, the parton interaction with low \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) contributes to the events with \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>300\) GeV in case \(Q^{2}=0.5M_{\gamma\gamma}^{2}+(p_{T}^{q(g)})^{2}\) for the parton showering. It could be possible if the selected jet which has the largest \(p_{T}\) is emited from the initial parton but not from the hard interaction as it is described above for the signal. The contribution from the low \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) region can be considered as some correction to the LO approximation. This contribution is about 30% for \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}<240\) GeV and increases with value of the \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}\) cut, e.g. it is about 38% for \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>400\) GeV.

The \(p_{T}^{jet}\) and \(p_{T}^{q(g)}\) distributions for the \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>300\) GeV cut are shown in Fig. 13. We can see that the low \(p_{T}\) region is saturated with the events which have \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}<240\) GeV in case \(Q^{2}=0.5M_{\gamma\gamma}^{2}+(p_{T}^{q(g)})^{2}\) for the parton showering.

## 4 Results

The production cross-sections for the Higgs boson with \(m_{H}=120\) GeV generated with QCD processes after applying the photons and jet selection criteria and after the \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>300\) GeV cut are presented in Table 1 for the following approaches for Higgs production:

1. \(gg\to H\) fusion process with ME corrections and factor 1.5;
2. \(gg\to Hg,gq\to Hq\) subprocesses with \(\hat{p}_{T}>20\) GeV;
3. \(gg\to Hg,gq\to Hq\) subprocesses with \(\hat{p}_{T}>20\) GeV without ISR and FSR;
4. \(gg\to Hg,gq\to Hq\) subprocesses with \(\hat{p}_{T}>10\) GeV.

The cross-sections for the parton-level calculation are also shown in this Table. The difference from the corresponding cross-sections in the parton-level study [1] is mainly due to the ATLAS barrel/endcap crack. About 10% of events is lost because the efficiencies of the reconstruction of isolated photons and jets are not 100% and the momentum rescaling. As expected, the \(2\to 2\) subprocesses with the \(\hat{p}_{T}>10\) GeV cut, which is too low, overestimate the cross-sections. The parton-showering has small influence on the cross-sections for Higgs production in the case \(2\to 2\) interaction with the proper choice of \(\hat{p}_{T}\) cut. The results are very similar in the case 1 and 2. In what follows the approach 1 is used as more consistent.

The cross-sections for the background events in the case \(m_{H}\) = 120 GeV after applying the photons and jet selection criteria and after the \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>300\) GeV cut are presented in Table 2 for the parton-level calculation, the calculation with the hadronization and the detector simulation without and with the parton-showering.

The inclusion of the detector simulation and FSR reduces the cross-section. The ISR increases the cross-section. The increase is very small for the \(Q^{2}=(p_{t}^{q(g)})^{2}\) choice for the parton-showering. The default PYTHIA choice \(Q^{2}=0.5M_{\gamma\gamma}^{2}+(p_{t}^{q(g)})^{2}\) is used in what follows to be conservative.

Table 3 shows the comparison of the cross-sections for the signal and background events and the contribution of the different channels. The cross-sections for the QCD and EW Higgs production are about the same after the \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>300\) GeV cut. In [1] only one jet with \(p_{T}^{jet}\,>\,30\) GeV and \(|\eta_{jet}|\,<\,4.5\) is required. This requirement suppresses the contribution from the EW Higgs production.

As expected the \(gq\to\gamma\gamma q\) channel is the main background for this channel.

The background processes contribute at a smaller \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}\) in comparison with the signal processes ( see Fig. 14 ). The \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>300\) GeV cut reduces the background by a factor of 6.1 while the signal is reduced only by a factor of 2.2.

The cross-sections for the parton-level calculation are also shown. The errors are statistical ones due to the Monte-Carlo calculations._The other cuts were considered to suppress the background. Unfortunately, it turns out that they are not very efficient. For example, the cut on the minimal separation between the photons and the jets in the event \(R_{\gamma-jet}\) which is correlated with the cut on \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}\) (See Fig. 15 \(\div\) 16).

For the evaluation of the number of the signal and background events the \(M_{\gamma\gamma}\) interval of \(\pm 1.4\sigma=3.64\) GeV was used with \(\sigma=1.3\) GeV [7]. This interval contains 80% of the signal events. The photon identification efficiency of 80% per photon is assumed.

The numbers of the signal and background events, the \(S/B\) ratios and the signal significances \(S/\sqrt{B}\) for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Table 4 after applying the photons and jet selection criteria and in Table 5 after \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>\)300 GeV cut. Here the reducible background is added. It is assumed 20% from the irreducible one.

The dependence of the \(S/B\) ratio and the significance on the \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}\) cut is shown in Fig. 17. The S/B ratio is significantly improved with increasing of the \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}\) cut value. \(S/\sqrt{B}\) varies slowly and has a maximum at the cut value about 300 GeV.

The results are presented for the different choices of \(Q^{2}\) for the parton-showering in the background calculations. The significance is above 5 for \(m_{H}\)= 110\(\div\)140 GeV in case \(Q^{2}=p_{T}{}^{q(g)}\) which corresponds the LO approximation. In other cases, where there is a contribution corresponded the NLO corrections, the significance and S/B ration has some low values. Note that the NLO K-factor for the large \(p_{T}\) Higgs production is not included here.

Fig. 19 shows the expected signal from Higgs over the background in \(M_{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution before and after the \(M_{\gamma\gamma jet}>\)300 GeV cut.

## 5 Conclusions

The detailed simulation of the signal and the background for \(H(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)+jet\) channel have been carried out for ATLAS detector. The promising results of the parton-level study [1] have been confirmed.

The different approaches for signal generation led to a similar results after the choice of the proper cuts and normalization. The background cross-section slightly differs from the parton-level estimate if the parton-showering generation corresponds the LO approximation. The more conservative approach yields a factor of 1.2 \(\div\) 1.4.

In any case, for \(m_{H}\)= 115 \(\div\) 140 GeV the signal significance was evaluated about or above 5 for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The S/B ratio could reach the values of 0.3 \(\div\) 0.5.
