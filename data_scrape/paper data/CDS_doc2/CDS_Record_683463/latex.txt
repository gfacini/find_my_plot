Introduction and scope of the study

### The ATLAS project

The ATLAS collaboration at CERN proposes to build a general purpose proton-proton detector for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), capable of exploring the new energy region which will become accessible. ATLAS is an international collaboration consisting of about 100 institutions (University groups and research laboratories) spread out all over the world. The ATLAS facility includes a large scintillating tile hadron calorimeter based on steel as showering material. This detector will have the task of measuring jets and missing transverse energy. The chosen technology is based on a sampling technique, with wavelength shifting fibre readout of the scintillating plates. Characteristic of this design is the unusual orientation of the scintillator tiles in the direction of the primary particle.

### Scope of these technical specifications

This document summarizes the characteristics and specifications of the steel sheets needed in the construction of the TILE calorimeter for the ATLAS detector at CERN. About 2400 t of ordinary low carbon magnetic laminated steel has to be supplied in form of sheets, ready for further processing (precision punching).

For the mechanical characteristics low internal stresses are important for the punching procedure; the flatness and the regularity of thickness are important for the geometry of the stack. The surface must be free of rust and must be protected against corrosion.

## 2 General Description

### The ATLAS tile hadron calorimeter

Mechanically this calorimeter consists of a cylindrical structure with an inner radius of 2250 mm and an outer radius of 4200 mm. It is divided into a 5900 mm long barrel part and two 2650 mm long extended barrel parts. Each of them is further subdivided into 64 independent sector modules. The steel structure of the active part of each sector module (for example the barrel module) consists of 325 repeated periods sandwiched between two steel end plates. Each period consists of 4 layers. The first and third layer are formed by large trapezoidal steel plates, 5 mm thick, spanning the full radial dimension of the module (master plates, 1550 mm long). In the second and fourth layer, smaller trapezoidal steel plates and scintillator tiles alternate along the radial dimension. The smaller steel trapezoids (spacer plates) are 4 mm thick and of 11 different sizes. In the assembly phase each module will be stacked up against a reference plane. In stacking the successive layers of the module the spacer plates will be placed by means of spring pins pressed into 8 mm holes ( 2 holes per spacer), joining a spacer plate to 2 adjacent master plates. The mounted spring pins will leave a continuous longitudinal channel of 6.5 mm diameter, through which 6 mm rods are fed once the stack is completed. These rods serve to apply a distributed pressure to the stack. On the outer face of the compressed stack (large radius) a strong steel profile will be welded, which will give rigidity to the structure and at the same time will support the light detectors.

### Materials, manufacturing and tolerances

* **base material** : Ordinary low-carbon rolled steel ( Fe 360 or equivalent, defined by the Euronorm EN10025) The chemical composition is defined in this norm, the main aspects are (the values are the maximum allowed): \(C=0.20\%\quad P=0.05\%\quad S=0.05\%\quad N=0.009\%\) The mechanical characteristics are defined by this norm as: \(Re(elastic\ limit)=235\ MPa\quad Rm(crack\ limit)=340\ MPa\) All steel must have the same chemical composition and must have undergone the same heat treatment. The normal magnetic properties of this type of steel are sufficient.
* **production conditions*
* : hot rolled plates. For the thickness of 5 \(mm\) and 4 \(mm\) the tolerances specified in the norm UNE 36-556-80 are: \(TK=4\pm 0.28\ mm\) and \(TK=5\pm 0.29\ mm\) Due to the production process it will be necessary to apply some additional mechanical and thermal treatments:
* Annealing in order to reduce the internal stresses.
Oxide elimination by sand flow application. * Skin-pass to eliminate the Lueders strips, improve surface finish and control the geometrical specifications. (the skin-pass is a cold rolling process with a reduction of thickness of about 5%). * Blueing in order to protect from oxidation. After these mechanical and thermal operations the thickness of the sheets must be: \(TK=4^{+0}_{-0.075}\ mm\) and \(TK=5^{+0}_{-0.075}\ mm\) Different but equivalent types of steel and production techniques can be proposed by the manufacturer to achieve similar thickness tolerances. * **quantity** * 20270 steel sheets of 1350 \(mm\times 1570\ mm\times 5mm\) for a total of about 1720 tons. * 10135 steel sheets of 1350 \(mm\times 1570\ mm\times 4mm\) for a total of about 688 tons. (different dimensions for the 4 mm sheets can also be considered). * **storage** : short-term storage must be provided to allow shipping to the final cutting and assembly plants. * **supplementary information** : associated to each material lot the manufacturer must provide the following information: * Chemical composition certificate * Mechanical characteristics certificate * Material history, including thermal and mechanical treatments and storage conditions. * Quality reports, including the production law (normally a gaussian law) * Magnetic characteristics certificate * Batch identification and history

## 3 Quality Checks and Requirements

Several quality checks (QC) on thickness and flatness tolerances as well as internal stresses and surface quality must be performed by the manufacturer on each batch. The manufacturer shall be entirely responsible for the correct manufacturing of the steel sheets as described in this specification. ATLAS will reserve the right to reject sheets not corresponding to the specifications. Typically for each batch the first, the middle and the last steel sheet will be used for these quality checks.

* **thickness checks*
* : the thickness of the 3 sheets per batch should be measured on 9 points as indicated in Figure 1. The distance from the sheet contour is 20 mm. This measurements can be made using a micrometer or an ultrasonic system. From these 9 measurements, 2 values should be retained:
* average thickness tolerance : \(TK_{nominal}^{lowbound}\leq TK_{average}\leq TK_{nominal}^{upperbound}\), where lowerbound and upperbound are the minimum and maximum values allowed.
* thickness dispersion: \(Q1=(TK_{min}-TK_{max})/TK_{average}\), where min and max are the minimum and maximum value measured on the 9 points. Q1 will not be bigger than 0.2% for the measured sheets.
* **internal stresses** : these will be measured by cutting the steel sheets along both axes of symmetry in 2 parts (different axes for different sheets) The displacements of the 2 halfs which are then put in contact should not exceed 0.3 mm (see figure 4). The sheets shall be as free as possible from internal stresses in order to avoid deformations of the profile of the lamination after punching.
* **surface planarity** : the sample sheet, laid flat on a marble plane without forces applied, will have to present a perfectly developable surface. Furthermore, the amplitude of any local ondulation cannot exceed 0.5% of the local wavelength. The wavelength should not be less than 800 mm in the case of ondulation in the middle of the sheet and 400 mm in the case of ondulation on the edge of the sheet (see figure 2).
* **surface quality** : The surfaces of the heat-treated sheets must be free of visible defects, rust and must be protected against corrosion. The tender is invited to propose a suitable process. Each sheet must have clean surfaces, without irregularities and bumps, in order to assure good stacking. The surface roughness must be of N10 quality according to norm UNE 1037 (E) (which means \(R_{a}=12.5\mu\), see figure 3 for definitions).

## 4 Access to Information and Responsibility

For the items covered by this specification, ATLAS must be informed about all technical details and any subcontracts.

During the manufacturing phase, periodical information shall be sent to ATLAS on the progress of the work. ATLAS also requests the right of access to the plant during manufacturing.

The manufacturer shall be entirely responsible for the correct manufacture of the items described in this specification. ATLAS reserves the right to reject all sheets which are part of a batch wherein the quality checks on the sample sheets are out of specification.

In order to prove the validity of the manufacturing procedure, some prototype steel sheets are required.
