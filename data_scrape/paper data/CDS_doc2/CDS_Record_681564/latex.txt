###### Abstract

Many physics goals in ATLAS and CMS require precise reconstruction of jets and missing transverse energy, among these there is the search for the Higgs boson and for the supersymmetric particles and the study of top quark physics. In this note the most relevant aspects related to the ATLAS and CMS hadron calorimetry and to jet and missing transverse energy reconstruction are described. The quality of the reconstruction, evaluated both on test beam data and simulated events, is presented.

## 1 Introduction

The search for the Higgs boson and for supersymmetric particles and the precise study of top quark are among the main physics goals in the ATLAS and CMS experiments. A precise reconstruction of jets is required to reconstruct top and Higgs decays and to measure the missing transverse energy (\(E_{T}^{miss}\)) allowing, for example, the identification of supersymmetric events.

Both CMS and ATLAS have used test beam data to understand the detector response to single hadrons. These studies, which represent the first step toward jet reconstruction, are discussed in the first section of this note.

The two basic steps of jet reconstruction, i.e., the definition of an algorithm to build clusters of calorimetric signals and the evaluation of the energies associated to them, are described in section 3. In the same section, resultson jet energy resolution and linearity are shown. In section 4 the method used to infer the parton energy from the reconstructed jet is presented. In the final section the most relevant issues regarding the missing \(E_{T}\) reconstruction are discussed. All the results discussed, unless otherwise specified, have been obtained for low luminosity (\(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)sec\({}^{-1}\)). Throughout the note emphasis is given to the comparison of approaches and performances between ATLAS and CMS.

## 2 The ATLAS and CMS Calorimeters

The design of ATLAS and CMS hadronic calorimeters have been driven by the request to have fine enough granularity to allow the detection of particles produced from high \(p_{T}\) particles, good hermeticity and pseudorapidity coverage for missing \(E_{T}\) measurement, good radiation hardness, a dynamic energy range spanning from the energy released by a minimum ionizing particle to a few TeV, a departure from linearity limited to a few percent up to a few TeV. In both experiments, different techniques at different rapidity ranges are used in order to optimize the detector performance maintaining, at the same time, sufficiently high radiation resistance.

The central (\(|\eta|<3\)) CMS electromagnetic calorimeter consists of lead-tungstate crystals covering 26 \(X_{0}\) (1.1 \(\lambda\)) in a length of 23 \(cm\). The electromagnetic calorimeter is followed by the hadronic sampling calorimeters [1], the barrel (HB) and the endcap section (HE), both consisting of 60 to 80 mm thick brass plates interleaved by 4 mm thick scintillator tiles. The whole structure will be placed inside the superconductive coil producing the 4 Tesla solenoidal magnetic, thus brass has been chosen since it is a non-magnetic material. In the barrel region (\(|\eta|<1.7\)) scintillators layers (HOB) are placed just beyond the magnet coil to increase the total depth of the hadronic barrel section. The full depth of HB and HOB is approximately 11 \(\lambda\). The hadronic calorimeter is longitudinally segmented into three sections, two in the HB and one in the HOB. The second section of the HB and the HOB are readout together and correspond to a single signal however the amplification factor of each section may be adjusted separately. The granularity of the central hadronic section is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.08\,7\times 0.08\,7\). The forward region (\(2.85<|\eta|<5.19\)) is equipped with a sampling calorimeter using iron and quartz fibers which is highly radiation resistant.

The electromagnetic section of the central ATLAS calorimeter [2] is a Liquid Argon sampling calorimeter where the absorber and read out lead plates are built in an accordion shape. The central electromagnetic (EM) section,located inside a cryostat (0.4 \(\lambda\)), is longitudinally segmented in three layers and covers a minimum number of 24 radiation lengths and 1.2 \(\lambda\). The hadronic Tile sampling calorimeter, lying just outside the cryostat, consists of three longitudinal samples of 4 to 5 mm thick iron plates and 3 mm thick scintillating tiles assembled in a particular geometry that makes the calorimeter very hermetic. The whole hadronic section is 7.2 \(\lambda\), and has a granularity equal to \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\). At high pseudorapidities, the intrinsically radiation-hard LAr technology is used for all the calorimeters.

ATLAS and CMS calorimeters are non compensated and the degree of non compensation, expressed through the value of the parameter \(e/h\), is equal to 1.4 and 1.30 for the hadronic central section of CMS [3] and ATLAS [4] respectively. The values of \(e/h\) are significantly higher for the electromagnetic sections. Non compensation produces a non-linearity of the pion signal of about \(15-20\%\) when the energy ranges from 20 GeV to 300 GeV. In both experiments compensations is achieved using software algorithms.

Detailed studies of the calorimeter performances are carried out exposing wedges of the calorimeters to beams in test areas. In CMS the energy of the single particles is reconstructed as a weighted sum of the energy deposited in the four sections, the electromagnetic one and the three hadronic ones, of the calorimeter system. In this approach (passive weighting) the weights are given an energy independent value chosen such as to optimize the energy resolution for single 300 GeV pions. A dynamic weighting algorithm was also investigated. In this latter case an energy dependent weight is given to the electromagnetic section. Both methods improve the energy resolution and linearity for single pions, with similar performances. The energy resolution obtained on single pions with the two algorithms is shown in Fig.1. With the passive weighting the energy resolution is well described by the function [3]:

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{122\%}{\sqrt{E(GeV)}}\oplus 5\% \tag{1}\]

The resolution of the hadron section only, obtained on pions seen as minimum ionizing particles in the electromagnetic calorimeter, is shown on the same figure and is expressed as:

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{(101\pm 0.1)\%}{\sqrt{E(GeV)}}\oplus(4\pm 0.1)\% \tag{2}\]

The degradation of the energy resolution of the combined calorimeter (electromagnetic + hadronic section) is due both to the difference between the \(e/h\) ratio for the hadronic and the electromagnetic calorimeters and to the difficulty in obtaining a good compensation when using an unsegmented electromagnetic calorimeter. The energy is reconstructed with a linearity of 15% on the energy range \(20-300\) GeV.

On Figure 1 is shown the resolution on single pions obtained in a ATLAS test beam [5] for a whole slice of the central calorimeter: liquid Argon electromagnetic and hadronic Tile calorimeter. Results obtained using two calibration algorithms are presented. The first one, designed to be simple and indicated as benchmark, is similar to the CMS calibration with passive weighting: the weights of each term are energy independent and are obtained by minimizing the fractional energy resolution of 300 GeV pions. Although simple to apply, the benchmark method does not fully correct for the non linearity introduced by the calorimeter non-compensation which, after calibration, still amounts to about 8% in the energy range \(10-300\) GeV. A second approach for reconstructing the pion energy, inspired to the technique used by the H1 collaboration [6], is based on correcting up-wards the response of cells with relatively small signals, in order to equalize their response to that of cells with large (typically electromagnetic) deposited energies. The total energy is reconstructed applying to the signal of each cell a correction factor which is a function of the energy deposition in the cell and the beam energy. Since in real life the latter information is not available an iterative procedure is applied. An initial estimate of the energy is obtained with a simple method, for example the benchmark method, and is used to have the first estimate of the weights. Then the reconstructed energy thus obtained is used as a new input to calculate new weights and a new estimate of the energy. After three iterations the reconstructed energy is stable within few tens of MeV. With the H1 method the energy is reconstructed with a \(\pm 2\%\) linearity (Fig.1, left) and with a resolution:

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\left[\frac{(41.9\pm 1.6)\%}{\sqrt{E(GeV)}}+(1.8\pm 0.1) \%\right]\oplus\frac{1.8\pm 0.1}{E(GeV)} \tag{3}\]

The energy resolution obtained with the H1 calibration method using the hadronic section only is [4]:

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{(43.6\pm 0.8)\%}{\sqrt{E(GeV)}}+(2.4\pm 0.1)\% \tag{4}\]

The comparison between the resolutions obtained by ATLAS and CMS for the combined calorimeter and for the hadronic section only, shows that differences are due partially to the structure of the hadronic sections (different values of the sampling terms in the energy resolution of the hadronic sections) and partially to the ability to compensate the response of the hadronicand electromagnetic sections. These different performances of the calorimeters were however already present at design level, infact the aimed energy resolution on single hadrons is equal to \((50\%/\sqrt{(}E)\oplus 3\%)\) for ATLAS [7] and \((120\%/\sqrt{(}E)\oplus 5\%)\) for CMS [8].

## 3 Jet reconstruction and calibration

The first step in jet reconstruction consists in defining a _jet algorithm_ to group the calorimetric signals. The following step, indicated as _recombination scheme_, specifies the formulas that allow to calculate the kinematical variables of the jet from the group of clusters. Some _jet algorithms_ allow to assigne the same cluster to more than one jet. In these cases it is necessary to define a splitting/merging procedure which allows to uniquely associate an energy release to a jet.

Among the many existing jet algorithms, the cone jet algorithm is the one historically used by hadron-hadron experiments. The use of this algorithm with seeds and merging/splitting rules, makes it difficult to apply to theoretical calculations [9], however thanks to its simplicity it can still be very usefull to understand details of jet reconstruction. In the following, for the

sake of clarity, it has been chosen to show only results obtained with the cone jet algorithm to compare the CMS and ATLAS performances.

Both CMS and ATLAS use the Snowmass _recombination scheme_[10] to calculate the kinematic variables of the jet.

Once the clusters belonging to a jet have been identified it is possible to reconstruct the jet energy from the cluster energy deposits. As for single particle reconstruction, the energy must be calibrated to correct for non compensation. ATLAS calibrates the jet energy using the H1 weighting tecnique similarly to the reconstruction of the single particle energy. In this case weights of each cell, function of the cell energy and of the nominal jet energy, are calculated minimizing the fractional energy resolution with respect to the total energy of the MC particles belonging to the jet. The jet energy resolution and linearity are shown for jets at \(|\eta|=0.3\) in Fig. 2 selected in a sample of back-to-back \(q\bar{q}\) dijet events. The linearity obtained with the cone algorithm is within \(\pm\) 2% and the resolution is equal to:

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{0.54}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 1.3\% \tag{5}\]

In CMS a first estimate of the jet energy is obtained using a weighted sum of the energy deposited in the four sections of the calorimeter as described previously for single particles. The jet energy so reconstructed however shows miscalibration effects both as a function of the energy and of the

pseudorapidity. An energy correction is thus obtained fitting the average reconstructed \(Et_{rec}\) as a function of the generated one (\(Et_{gen}\)) by a second order polinomial : \(<Et_{rec}>=p_{2}\cdot(Et_{gen})^{2}+p_{1}\cdot Et_{gen}+p_{0}\), and determining three \(\eta\) dependent coefficients \((p_{0},p_{1},p_{2})\) used to extract the calibrated jet energy from the reconstructed one [11]. The calibration improves the jet linearity to about \(\pm\) 1% in the trasverse energy range \(25-400\) GeV (Fig. 3 left). The resolution obtained on calibrated jets, including electronic noise and pileup, is:

\[\frac{\sigma(E_{T})}{E_{T}}=\frac{1.18}{\sqrt{E_{T}}}\oplus\,0.07 \tag{6}\]

## 4 From jet to parton

The precision required on the absolute parton energy scale, imposed mainly by the requirement to reconstruct jet resonances, is at the level of 1%. In particular miscalibrations of the energy scale of either the light jets or b-jets are among of the main source of systematic uncertainties on the measurement of the top mass. Two main issues should be addressed in reconstructing the absolute energy scale: the definition of a method to correct for the amount of energy that has not been correctly attributed to the reconstructed jet and the subtraction of energy not associated to the high \(p_{T}\) interaction (underlying event, multiple interactions, pile-up, noise). Only the first isusse is discussed here, for the latter a refined strategy is still under study.

To correct for energy losses and to set the absolute energy scale the \(p_{T}\) bal

two different variables: the module of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) (CMS) and the scalar sum of the trasverse energy of the whole event (ATLAS). In the latter case the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution is well described by: \(\sigma(E_{T}^{miss})=0.46\cdot\sqrt{\Sigma|E_{T}|}\). It has been shown by ATLAS that the same formula well describe the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution of other samples such as: \(A^{0}\) having masses ranging from 150 to 800 GeV, \(Z^{0}\to\tau\tau\) and dijet events, where the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is small and mainly due to instrumental effects.

The effect of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution obtained by the two collaborations may be evaluated comparing the widths of the invariant mass distributions of the resonance \(A^{0}\to\tau\tau\). The precision of the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) measurement has direct impact on the reconstruction of this resonance since this information is used to evalute the momenta of the neutrinos generated in the \(\tau\) decay. In the case of \(M(A_{0})=500\) GeV the resolutions for ATLAS and CMS are equal to 12% and 15% respectively.

## 6 Conclusions

Some of the most important physics issues addressed by ATLAS and CMS require excellent jet and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction. The performances of the

The plot shown for ATLAS [4] has been obtained using a full detector simulation up to \(|\eta|<3\) and a fast detector simulation for \(3<|\eta|<5\) (full circles), for control one point (star) has also been calculated with a complete detector simulation on the whole pseudorapidity range (\(|\eta|<5\)). For CMS plots [14] three curves are shown: ”no corrections”, i.e., calibration coefficients not applyed, ”type 1 corrections”, i.e., only coefficients for jets are applyed and ”type 2 corrections”, i.e., both jets and single towers are corrected.

calorimetric systems that the two collaborations are building have been investigated with single particles in test beams. The results of these studies proved that the resolution and linearity required for the calorimeter design can indeed be achieved in realistic conditions. The many aspects of the complex issue of jet and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction are under study. The results shown prove that the reconstruction quality is in good agreement with the required performance. Much work is still required to better tune the calibration and reconstruction algorithm and to evaluate all the instrumental and physical effects. It would be very useful if ATLAS and CMS could start a common work on jet reconstruction.
