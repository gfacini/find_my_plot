Combined effective field theory interpretation of differential cross-section measurements of \(Ww\), \(Wz\), \(4\ell\), and \(Z\)-plus-two-jets production using ATLAS data

The ATLAS Collaboration

Wilson coefficients of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) are constrained in a combined fit of differential cross-section measurements of \(WW\) and \(WZ\) production in leptonic final states, the production of four charged leptons, and the production of a leptonically decaying \(Z\) boson in vector-boson-fusion topology. The measurements are based on 36-139 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV. The SMEFT interpretation is performed using a combined likelihood function that takes into account experimental uncertainties and their correlation as well as theoretical uncertainties on Standard Model predictions. Linear combinations of Warsaw basis coefficients are constrained, both in a model containing only linear dimension-six contributions and in one that also includes squared dimension-six contributions. The effect of 33 SMEFT operators that affect the measurements is simulated and 15 sensitive directions in parameters space are constrained simultaneously. No significant deviations from the Standard Model expectation are found. This note highlights how such combined interpretations of multiple measurements can be carried out technically and is a stepping stone for more global effective field theory interpretations.

## 1 Introduction

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT, see for example Ref. [1] for an overview) allows for the description of the effects of a variety of theories beyond the Standard Model (SM) that introduce new-physics states at a mass scale \(\Lambda\) that is large in comparison to the electroweak scale. The theory provides predictions for experimental observables in terms of an expansion in \(E/\Lambda\), where \(E\) is the typical energy exchanged in the process. This is done by using a series of operators \(\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(d)}\), which consist of gauge invariant combinations of SM fields with an energy dimension \(d\) greater than four:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{SMEFT}}=\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}+\sum_{i}\frac{c_{i}^{(5)}}{ \Lambda}\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(5)}+\sum_{i}\frac{c_{i}^{(6)}}{\Lambda^{2}}\mathcal{ O}_{i}^{(6)}+\ldots. \tag{1}\]

Measurements of observables sensitive to the effect of SMEFT operators allow to constrain \(c_{i}^{(d)}/\Lambda^{d-4}\), where \(c_{i}^{(d)}\) are the Wilson coefficients associated to the dimension-\(d\) operator \(\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(d)}\).

In this note a SMEFT interpretation of four measurements is performed to constrain dimension-six operators. The operators are given in terms of the Warsaw basis [2], which provides a complete set of operators allowed by the gauge symmetries. The interpretation combines the measurements of \(WW\) production in the \(e^{\pm}\nu\mu^{\mp}\nu\) final state [3] (where \(\nu\) encompasses both neutrinos and anti-neutrinos), \(WZ\) production in the \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{\pm}\nu\) final state [4] (where \(\ell=e,\mu\)), four lepton production [5] (\(4\ell\), with \(4\ell=\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-}e^{+}e^{-},e^{+}e^{-}e^{+}e^{ -}\)), and \(Z\) boson production in vector-boson-fusion (VBF) topologies with subsequent \(Z\) decay into leptons [6]. The measurements are sensitive to a large number of dimension-six operators that affect weak boson self-couplings, couplings of weak bosons to fermions, and four-fermion couplings.

## 2 Data and input measurements

The \(WW\) and \(WZ\) measurements are based on 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC during the years 2015 and 2016 while the \(4\ell\) and VBF \(Z\) measurements are performed with the full Run 2 data set collected between 2015 and 2018 and corresponding to 139 fb\({}^{-1}\).

For all four analysed processes, multiple differential particle-level cross-sections1 are measured in a fiducial volume that is close to the detector acceptance. From each measurement, the differential cross-section that offers the best sensitivity to a certain class of operators is used for this SMEFT re-interpretation, as outlined below. The event selection criteria of the four measurements are orthogonal to each other. Background contributions to the measurements are either small or estimated with data-driven methods that reduce the dependence of the background prediction on the simulation of the hard process. In both cases, the influence of dimension-six operators on backgrounds is expected to have a small effect on the measurement of the signal process and is neglected in this analysis. The determination of the fiducial differential cross-sections from the data is also fairly model independent, as it mainly relies on the correct modelling of the detector and because little extrapolation beyond the fiducial volume accessible by the detector is performed. Dimension-six operators introduce smooth effects on the measured distributions, with kinematic properties that are similar to the SM prediction. These effects can thus be recovered in ameasurement that assumes SM physics for the unfolding to the particle-level. Injection test of new physics signals performed in the \(4\ell\) analysis suggest that even resonant signals are recovered, with higher accuracy for broader resonances [5].

The \(WW\) measurement [3] accepts events with leptons of opposite charge and different flavour. A veto on jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>35\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<4.5\) is employed in the signal region and a requirement of \(m_{e\mu}>55\GeV\) suppresses contributions from resonant Higgs boson production. The dominant background of the measurement is top-quark production, whose contribution is estimated from control regions with a data-driven technique. The remaining backgrounds are due to misidentified or non-prompt leptons (referred to as fake leptons), Drell-Yan, and non-\(WW\) diboson production, and each contribute with less than 5% to the total SM event yield. The fake lepton background is estimated with a data-driven method. As an input to the SMEFT interpretation in this note, the differential \(WW\) cross-section as a function of the leading charged lepton transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead.\;lep}}\), with 14 bins, is used. The lowest threshold is 27 and the last bin includes events with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead.\;lep}}\). of greater than 300. The distribution is sensitive to SMEFT operators whose impact increases with the parton centre-of-mass energy, \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\).

In the \(WZ\) measurement [4], the two leptons associated with the \(Z\) boson are required to have an invariant mass of \(66\GeV<m_{\ell\ell}<116\GeV\) and a minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 15, while \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\GeV\) is required for the third lepton. In contrast to the \(WW\) measurement, the selection is inclusive in the number of jets. The main backgrounds are due to fake-lepton contributions, which are estimated with a data-driven method, and due to \(ZZ\) and the production of top quarks in association with a vector boson. Each of the three background sources contributes less than 10% to the total number of selected events. For the SMEFT interpretation in this note, the \(WZ\) cross-section as a function of the transverse mass2, \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{WZ}\), which is measured in six bins, with the first (last) bin including events with a transverse mass between 0 and 140 (greater than 600), is used. This distribution also serves as a proxy for \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) and is sensitive to operators whose impact increases with the centre-of-mass energy.

Footnote 2: The transverse mass is defined as \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{WZ}=\sqrt{\left(\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{ \mathrm{miss}}\right)^{2}-\left(\sum\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}+\vec{E}_{ \mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\right)^{2}}\), where \(\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) are the charged lepton transverse momentum vectors and their magnitude, respectively, and \(\vec{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) are the missing transverse momentum vector and its magnitude.

The \(4\ell\) measurement [5] accepts all events with four prompt leptons (\(\ell^{+}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{-}\)) as signal. The leading (sub-leading) lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is required to be at least 20 (10) and every same-flavour opposite-charge lepton pair is required to fulfil \(m_{\ell\ell}>5\GeV\). Leptons are paired into a primary pair, which is the same-flavour opposite-charge pair with an invariant mass closer to the \(Z\) boson mass and a secondary pair, which is the remaining lepton pair. The differential cross-section as a function of the invariant mass of the secondary pair, \(m_{Z2}\) is used for the SMEFT interpretation. This observable allows to distinguish operators that mainly contribute to on-shell \(Z\) boson production from those whose effect is more prominent at higher or lower dilepton invariant mass. The observable is analyzed in three regions of the four-lepton invariant mass: one denoted "\(m_{4\ell}\approx m_{Z}\)" (\(60\GeV<m_{4\ell}<100\GeV\)), one denoted "\(m_{4\ell}>2m_{Z}\)" (\(180\GeV<m_{4\ell}<2000\GeV\)), and one denoted "off-shell" (\(20\GeV<m_{4\ell}<60\GeV\) or \(100\GeV<m_{4\ell}<120\GeV\) or \(130\GeV<m_{4\ell}<180\GeV\)). A fourth measurement region, which targets on-shell Higgs boson production, is omitted from the SMEFT interpretation to emulate the approach of future combinations that will also include dedicated measurements of Higgs boson cross-sections. The main signal contribution is due to \(q\bar{q}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) production but \(H\to 4\ell\) decays as well as triboson and \(t\bar{t}V\) production are also treated as part of the signal and not subtracted as background. These processes comprise at most 3% of the total event yield. The fake lepton background, which contributes about 5% of the total number of selected events, is estimated with a data-driven method.

The VBF \(Z\) analysis [6] targets the production of two opposite-sign same-flavour leptons with an invariant mass of \(81\GeV<m_{\ell\ell}<101\GeV\), accompanied by two jets with an invariant mass of at least \(1\TeV\) and a rapidity difference of \(|\Delta y_{jj}|>2\). The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading (subleading) jet is required to be at least \(85\) (\(80\)) GeV and a veto on additional jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\) in the gap between the two leading jets is employed. The \(Z\) boson is required to be centrally produced relative to the two jets by imposing \(\xi_{Z}<1\), where \(\xi_{Z}\) is defined as \(\xi_{Z}=\big{|}y_{\ell\ell}-0.5(y_{j1}+y_{j2})\big{|}/|\Delta y_{jj}|\). The nominal results of the analysis are differential cross-sections of electroweak \(Zjj\) production, for which \(Zjj\) events in which jets are produced by the strong interaction are subtracted as background. This background subtraction procedure is expected to fail in the presence of some dimension-six operators introduced in this note. However, the VBF \(Z\) analysis also provides alternative results, which include strong \(Zjj\) production as part of the signal. Therefore, this work employs for SMEFT interpretation the differential cross-section of the combined electroweak and strong \(Zjj\) production, as a function of the signed azimuthal angle between the two jets, \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\). The \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\) variable is defined as \(\phi_{f}-\phi_{b}\), where the two highest transverse-momentum jets \(f\) and \(b\) are ordered such that \(y_{f}>yb\). In the original analysis [6], it has been found that this observable is very sensitive to the effect of the triple-gauge-coupling operator \(O_{W}\). Limits on \(O_{W}\) obtained using measurements of differential cross-sections of electroweak and inclusive \(Zjj\) production are compared as a cross check and found to be in good agreement.

The statistical uncertainties of the four measurements were estimated in the Gaussian limit, based on the observed number of events in each analysis bin. Studies performed as part of the \(4\ell\) analysis indicate that this statistical uncertainty estimate biases measurements of some Wilson coefficients towards values that correspond to smaller cross-sections. Furthermore, the coverage probability of confidence intervals did not agree with the one expected in the limit of Wilks' theorem [7], which is also used in this SMEFT interpretation, as discussed in Section 5. For the SMEFT interpretation presented in the \(4\ell\) paper, statistical uncertainties were thus estimated based on the expected number of SM events. In this combined SMEFT interpretation, bins of the \(4\ell\) analysis are instead merged. This reduces statistical fluctuations and improves the accuracy of the Gaussian approximation of the originally Poisson-distributed uncertainties. Three bins are combined to one, except for bins in the region where both \(Z\) bosons are on-shell, as statistical uncertainties are small in these bins, and except for the highest \(m_{ZZ}\) bins, which are required to differentiate the impact of some SMEFT operators. The remaining three measurements are not expected to be affected by the discussed problem as they are performed in fewer bins, of which most correspond to a relatively large number of events.

The distributions from the four measurements that are included in the SMEFT reinterpretation are shown in Figure 1 and compared to the theoretical predictions introduced in Section 3.3.

## 3 Theoretical predictions

### SMEFT parametrization

The general formulation introduced in Equation 1 can be simplified by ignoring odd-dimensional operators, which introduce lepton and baryon number violation, and by restricting the expansion to its leading terms, yielding

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SMEFT}}\approx\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{SM}}^{(4)}+\sum_{i} \frac{c_{i}^{(6)}}{\Lambda^{2}}\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(6)}+\sum_{j}\frac{c_{j}^{(8) }}{\Lambda^{4}}\mathcal{O}_{j}^{(8)}. \tag{2}\]Figure 1: Measured differential cross-sections compared to the SM theory predictions used in this analysis. From top left to bottom right: The leading lepton transverse momentum in \(WW\) production, the \(WZ\) transverse mass in \(WZ\) production, the invariant mass of the secondary lepton pair (the pair that is less compatible with the \(Z\) boson mass) in the three \(4\ell\) analysis regions (one targeting \(Z\to 4\ell\), one targeting off-shell \(ZZ\) production and one targeting on-shell \(ZZ\) production), and the signed azimuthal angle between the two jets in \(Z\)+jets production with a VBF topology.

Here \({\cal L}_{SM}^{(4)}\) is the SM Lagrangian, which contains dimension-two and dimension-four operators only. In the remaining terms, \({\cal O}_{i}^{(d)}\) denote the dimension-\(d\) operators, and \(c_{i}^{(d)}\) stand for the corresponding dimensionless coupling constants referred to as Wilson coefficients. Throughout this note, \(\Lambda=1\) TeV is assumed. Results for alternative values of the new-physics scale, \(\Lambda^{\prime}\), can be obtained by multiplying the dimension-six Wilson coefficients by \((\Lambda^{\prime}/\Lambda)^{2}\).

Scattering cross-sections can be approximated by

\[\sigma \propto|{\cal M}_{\rm SMEFT}|^{2}\] \[=|{\cal M}_{\rm SM}|^{2}+\sum_{i}\frac{c_{i}^{(6)}}{\Lambda^{2}} 2\mbox{Re}\left({\cal M}_{i}^{(6)}{\cal M}_{\rm SM}^{*}\right)+\sum_{i}\frac{ \left(c_{i}^{(6)}\right)^{2}}{\Lambda^{4}}\Big{|}{\cal M}_{i}^{(6)}\Big{|}^{2 }+\sum_{i<j}\frac{c_{i}^{(6)}c_{j}^{(6)}}{\Lambda^{4}}2\mbox{Re}\left({\cal M }_{i}^{(6)}{\cal M}_{j}^{(6)*}\right) \tag{3}\] \[\quad+O\left(\Lambda^{-4}\right),\]

where \({\cal M}_{\rm SM}\) is the matrix element as it occurs in the SM and \({\cal M}_{i}^{(6)}\) are amplitudes containing the operator \({\cal O}_{i}^{(6)}\). The leading contribution in \(\Lambda^{-2}\) is thus given by the interference of dimension-six new-physics effects with the SM, \(\frac{c_{i}^{(6)}}{\Lambda^{2}}2\mbox{Re}\left({\cal M}_{i}^{(6)}{\cal M}_{\rm SM }^{*}\right)\) - also referred to as linear term. The additional contributions, from dimension-six squared amplitudes (quadratic terms) and the interference of two amplitudes containing two different dimension-six operators (cross terms) are expected to be subleading as they enter at \(O(\Lambda^{-4})\). Further \(O(\Lambda^{-4})\) contributions, which include the interference of dimension-eight operators with the SM or double insertion of dimension-six operators are neglected in this analysis.

Results are provided for both a "linear" model that includes contributions up to \(O(\Lambda^{-2})\) and a "linear plus quadratic" model that includes the \(O(\Lambda^{-4})\) contributions that are explicitly listed in Equation 3. As not all \(O(\Lambda^{-4})\) are known and only a subset is included in the fit, the difference between results obtained using the "linear" and "linear plus quadratic" model can be used as a qualitative measure of an uncertainty due the missing \(O(\Lambda^{-4})\) contributions.

The cross-section \(\sigma_{b}\) of a given process in a measurement bin \(b\) can be expanded as

\[\sigma_{b}=\sigma_{b}^{\rm SM}\left(1+\sum_{i}A_{bi}c_{i}+\sum_{i}B_{bi}c_{i} ^{2}+\sum_{i<j}C_{bij}c_{i}c_{j}\right), \tag{4}\]

where \(\sigma_{b}^{\rm SM}\) is the SM cross-section and \(A_{bi}\), \(B_{bi}\), and \(C_{bij}\) correspond to the linear, quadratic, and cross terms in bin \(b\), relative to the SM cross-section. From here on, the superscript \({}^{(6)}\) is dropped for dimension-six operators and their Wilson coefficients.

### Simulation of the effect of dimension-six operators

The effect of dimension-six operators on the signal production processes is simulated at leading order. The first two quark and all three lepton generations are treated as massless and the \(\{m_{W},m_{Z},G_{\rm F}\}\) electroweak input parameter scheme is used. The topU31 flavour symmetry [8], which imposes a flavour symmetry in the first two quark and all three lepton generations, is imposed. For the presented analysis, the use of this flavour symmetry is almost equivalent to a \(U(3)^{5}\) flavour symmetry [9] as third generation quarks only enter in the initial state and as final state jets and both of these contributions do not impact the input measurements.

The list of operators and the corresponding Wilson coefficient affecting the processes studied in this note is given in Table 1. The operators are grouped in purely bosonic operators, operators containing both boson and fermion fields, four-lepton operators, four-fermion operators containing both quark and lepton fields, and four-quark operators. In total 33 CP-even operators are considered. All operators affecting the measured processes at leading order are included, with few exceptions. The operators \(\mathcal{O}_{HB}\), \(\mathcal{O}_{HW}\), \(\mathcal{O}_{HG}\), and \(\mathcal{O}_{H\Box}\) are neglected as they only affect Higgs-boson production and decay, which is strongly suppressed by the event selection criteria of the measurements. Most four-lepton operators are neglected as well, as their effect on the measurements included in this analysis is relatively small [5, 10]. Only the Wilson coefficient \(c_{ll}^{(1)}\) is retained here, which affects the strength of the electroweak interaction, as it enters the determination of the input parameter \(G_{\mathrm{F}}\) in muon decays. The effect of four-fermion operators that couple to quarks and leptons is strongly suppressed by the \(81\mathrm{GeV}<m_{\ell\ell}<101\mathrm{GeV}\) requirement of the VBF \(Z\) analysis and is thus neglected for \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}jj\) production. At O(\(\Lambda^{-2}\)), CP-odd operators only affect the VBF \(Z\) measurement, as \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\) is the only CP-odd observable analyzed. They are thus neglected, as the combination with the other three measurements offers little benefit.

Dedicated samples representing SM, linear, and quadratic effects of dimension-six operators, as well as dimension-six cross terms, are generated at leading order using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 2.8.1 [11] and the SMEFTsim 3.0 model [8, 9]. Events are interfaced to Pythia 8.244 [12] to simulate parton shower and hadronization. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons are performed by EvtGen[13]. Particle level events are analyzed using Rivet 3.1.2 [14].

The effect of dimension-six operators can change the mass and width of intermediate particles, which constitutes an important correction in cases where intermediate particles are on-shell. To account for the effect in the linearized SMEFT expansion, propagator corrections are calculated with SMEFTsim 3.0 using dummy fields, following the methodology described in Refs [8, 15]. Quadratic corrections are expected to be small and are neglected. For the case of the \(WW\), \(WZ\), and VBF \(Z\) measurements, which are dominated by on-shell boson production, the corrections are flat as a function of the measured observable and in good agreement with a linearized branching ratio correction, given by

\[1-\sum_{V}\sum_{i}c_{i}\,\frac{\delta\Gamma^{\mathrm{tot}}_{V,i}}{\Gamma^{ \mathrm{tot}}_{V}} \tag{5}\]

where \(\Gamma^{\mathrm{tot}}_{V}\) is the total width of the boson \(V\), \(\delta\Gamma^{\mathrm{tot}}_{V,i}\) is the linear shift in the total width due to \(c_{i}=1\), and the sum over \(V\) includes \(W\) twice, \(W\) as well as \(Z\), and \(Z\) for the \(WW\), \(WZ\), and \(Zjj\) measurements, respectively.

Higher-order QCD and electroweak corrections are included approximately under the assumption that their relative effect does not change in the presence of dimension-six operators. Differential cross-sections predictions in the SMEFT, which are obtained with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia at leading order (LO), are thus scaled in each differential bin by the ratio of a more precise SM particle-level prediction to the LO SM prediction. It is also assumed that the relative effect of theory uncertainties derived for the SM processes remains valid in the presence of dimension-six operators. Details on the precision SM predictions used are given in Section 3.3.

The SMEFT parametrization of the differential cross-sections is summarized in Figure 2 and Figure 3 for selected operators. Omitted from the figure are four-quark operators involving right-handed quarks as well as \(O_{G}\). The effect of these operators is relatively small and the interference with the SM is close to zero. While not shown in these figures, the interference of amplitudes containing different dimension-six operators, referred to as cross terms, is also simulated for all pairs of operators.

The measurement uncertainty is shown as a grey band. The values of Wilson coefficients approximately correspond to the \(2\sigma\) sensitivity from a fit of the SMEFT model with linear terms only.

### Simulation of Standard Model processes

The \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu\mu^{\mp}\nu\), \(q\bar{q}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{\pm}\nu\), and \(q\bar{q}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) production modes in the SM are modelled using the Sherpa2.2.2[16] generator at next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in the strong coupling for up to one additional parton, and LO accuracy for up to three additional parton emissions. The NNPDF3.0NNLO set of parton distribution functions (PDF) is used [17], along with a set of tuned parton-shower parameters developed by the Sherpa authors. The calculations are matched and merged with the Sherpa parton shower based on Catani-Seymour dipole factorisation [18; 19], using the MEPS@NLO prescription [20; 21; 22; 23]. Virtual QCD corrections were provided by the OpenLoops library [24; 25].

NLO electroweak corrections for the above processes [26; 27; 28; 29] are applied as function of \(m_{4\ell}\) for \(q\bar{q}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) and applied as a function of the measured observable for \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu\mu^{\mp}\nu\) and \(q\bar{q}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{\pm}\nu\).

The gluon-initiated \(4\ell\) and \(e^{\pm}\nu\mu^{\mp}\nu\) production processes are simulated using Sherpa2.2.2 at LO precision for up to one additional parton emission, with the parton-shower modelling being the same as for the quark-initiated samples. NLO QCD calculations [30; 31; 32] are used to correct the \(gg\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) cross-section differentially and the \(gg\to e^{\pm}\nu\mu^{\mp}\nu\) cross-section with a constant factor. For \(gg\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\), an additional correction factor of 1.2 is taken from the ratio of a NNLO QCD calculation [33; 34] with the NLO prediction.

Electroweak \(Zjj\) production is modelled with Herwig7.1.5[35; 36] and VBFNLO3.0.0[37] at NLO QCD. The MMHT2014LO PDF set [38] is used along with the default set of tuned parameters for parton showering, hadronization and underlying event. EvtGen is used for the simulation of bottom and charm hadron decays. Strong \(Zjj\) production is modelled using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[39] event generator and the NNPDF2.3NLO PDF set [40]. The prediction is accurate to NLO in the strong coupling for up to two partons in the final state. Events are interfaced to Pythia8.186 for parton showering, hadronization and underlying-event activity, using the A14 set of tuned parameters [41]. Overlaps between the matrix element and the parton shower are removed using the FxFx prescription [42]. The sample is normalised to a NNLO prediction for inclusive \(Z\)-boson production [43].

Additional processes introduce minor contributions to the fiducial phase space of the \(4\ell\) measurement. These are modelled as described in Ref [5].

## 4 Systematic uncertainties

### Experimental uncertainties

This combined SMEFT interpretation is subject to various systematic uncertainties, many of which affect multiple or all of the measurements. In the \(WW\) analysis, the dominant experimental uncertainty sources arise from the calibration of the jet energy scale and resolution, the \(b\)-tagging efficiency, the luminosity measurement, the pile-up modelling, as well as from the determination of lepton identification and isolation efficiency. The main background uncertainties are related to the modelling of the \(t\bar{t}\) and single top quark backgrounds as well as the background due to non-prompt and misidentified leptons. In the \(WZ\) and \(4\ell\) analyses the dominant experimental uncertainties are the uncertainty in the luminosity measurement, lepton efficiencies, and pile-up modelling, while the dominant background uncertainty is due to the modelling of the non-prompt background. The main uncertainties of the VBF \(Z\) analysis are jet energy scale and resolution, luminosity measurement, pile-up, as well as lepton identification and isolation efficiency.

The correlation of systematic uncertainties between bins of the same measurement has been evaluated as part of the original measurements. For this analysis, the correlation of bins of different measurements is additionally evaluated. Following the methodology of Ref [44], the luminosity uncertainty is split into three components, one that is correlated across all measurements, one that corresponds to an uncertainty on the integrated luminosity collected in 2015/2016, and one that corresponds to the uncertainty of the 2017/2018 luminosity, which only affects the \(4\ell\) and VBF \(Z\) measurements. Part of the lepton efficiency uncertainty is assumed to be correlated across all bins of all four measurements. Most measurement bins are populated by events with leptons of moderate transverse momentum. For these bins, lepton efficiency uncertainties are strongly correlated and of the order of 1%. It is assumed that this correlation also holds across measurements and thus a fully correlated uncertainty with a magnitude of 1% of the measured cross section in each bin is assumed. For high-lepton-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) events additional uncertainty components become important. Their correlation is neglected as measurements in the corresponding analysis bins are statistically limited. The uncertainty of the pile-up modelling, which is evaluated with a consistent methodology for all four measurements, is treated as correlated. Furthermore, the uncertainty of the pile-up jet suppression efficiency is relevant in the \(WW\) and VBF \(Z\) measurement and treated as correlated. Three jet energy scale uncertainty components related to the influence of pile-up on the jet energy scale calibration as well as on the energy scale inter-calibration between central central and forward \(\eta\) regions are correlated among the \(WW\) and VBF \(Z\) measurements. The impact of uncertainties is found to be positively correlated between measurements, except for the \(\eta\) inter-calibration uncertainty, which is anti-correlated between the \(WW\) and VBF \(Z\) measurements. An overview of the correlated uncertainty sources is given in Table 2. The correlation of measurements in the bins of all four analyses is visualized in Figure 4.

The correlation of additional components of the jet energy scale and resolution uncertainty between \(WW\) and VBF \(Z\) measurements is not taken into account, as different calibrations and different schemes to report the uncertainty are used. A possible correlation in the modelling of the fake and misidentified lepton background is also neglected, as different estimation methods are used for the different analyses. The possible correlation of background process uncertainties in one measurement with signal uncertainties in another measurement, for example for \(WZ\) (\(ZZ\)) production, which is a background in the \(WW\) (\(WZ\)) measurement, is not taken into account as these background uncertainties are relatively small.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline Correlated Uncertainty Source & \(WW\) & \(WZ\) & \(4\ell\) & VBF \(Z\) \\ \hline Luminosity (correlated part) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) \\ Luminosity 2015/16 & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) \\ Luminosity 2017/18 & & & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) \\ Lepton efficiency (correlated part) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) \\ Pile-up modelling & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) & \(\checkmark\) \\ Pile-up jet suppression & \(\checkmark\) & & & \(\checkmark\) \\ Jet energy scale (Pile-up modelling) & \(\checkmark\) & & & \(\checkmark\) \\ Jet energy scale \(\eta\)-inter-calibration & \(\checkmark\) & & & \(\checkmark\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Sources of experimental uncertainties that are modelled as correlated between measurements. The checkmark indicates the measurements affected by the uncertainties.

### Theory uncertainties

Theoretical uncertainties in the modelling of signal processes also play an important role as constraints on Wilson coefficients are obtained from a comparison of measurements with theory prediction. These uncertainties are evaluated for the SM processes and it is assumed that the relative uncertainty in each analysis bin remains valid in the presence of dimension-six EFT operators. All modelling uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated for different processes, unless stated otherwise.

Scale uncertainties are evaluated for all processes by varying the factorization and renormalization scales used in the nominal matrix element generator independently by factors of 0.5 and 2, and by taking the envelope of the observed variations as an uncertainty. The impact of scale uncertainties on the measurements is of the order of 10%.

The impact of uncertainties in the parton distribution functions and \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) is evaluated by reweighting events using variations of the nominal PDF set. PDF uncertainties are subdominant and assumed to be correlated for all diboson processes, which are simulated using the same PDF set and are dominantly induced by \(q\bar{q}\) initial states at similar parton-centre-of-mass energies.

For \(WW\), \(WZ\), and \(4\ell\) production a 100% uncertainty on the NLO electroweak correction is introduced, to account for non-factorizing effects and a possible double counting of real photon emissions in the parton

Entries outside the block diagonal, which correspond to correlations across measurements, are estimated for this SMEFT interpretation.

shower. For \(e^{\pm}\nu\mu^{\mp}\nu\) production this is the dominant uncertainty, corresponding to a 3% effect in the first analysis bin, rising to a 25% effect in the last bin.

To account for additional uncertainties in the modelling of jets, the acceptance of the \(WW\) fiducial selection criteria is evaluated using a sample generated with Powheg Box v2 [45; 46; 47; 48] matched to Pythia 8.210 [12], which employs an alternative parton shower model. Furthermore, the merging scale of the nominal Sherpa sample is varied. Generator comparisons are also used in the interpretation of the VBF \(Z\) analysis as large differences are observed in the \(Zjj\) modelling of both electroweak and strong production. For electroweak production the nominal prediction is compared to an EW \(Zjj\) sample produced with Powheg Box v1 [45; 46; 47] and Pythia8.186. The predicted fiducial cross-section is 20% larger than the one from the nominal simulation. An alternative strong \(Zjj\) sample is generated with SHERPA2.2.1 at NLO accuracy for up to two partons in the final state and at LO accuracy for three or four partons in the final state, using the NNPDF3.0NNLO PDF set. The sample is normalized to the same total cross-section as the nominal sample and differences in the simulated acceptance and shape of the \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\) distribution are used to estimate uncertainties. The modelling of the dijet system at high invariant mass, \(m_{jj}\), varies significantly, which results in an uncertainty on the predicted rate for strong \(Zjj\) production of about 20%.

By default, uncertainties in different bins of the same measurement are treated as correlated. To obtain a more realistic estimate of modelling uncertainties and to give the fit model additional flexibility, some of the uncertainties are split into multiple uncorrelated components. The \(WZ\) scale uncertainty is separated into a normalization and a shape uncertainty. The latter mainly affects the last two analysis bins where its relative effect is 5-10%. Scale uncertainties evaluated in different \(4\ell\) analysis regions are treated as uncorrelated. For strong \(Zjj\) production, for which the two compared predictions exhibit sizeable shape and normalization differences, shape and normalization uncertainties are decorrelated. Additionally, a 10% uncertainty on strong \(Zjj\) production is introduced that is uncorrelated in measurement bins that correspond to different \(\left|\Delta\phi_{jj}\right|\). The magnitude of this uncertainty corresponds to the approximate size of scale uncertainties. It is a conservative estimate of uncertainties in the predicted \(\left|\Delta\phi_{jj}\right|\) shape. The introduction of the uncertainty mainly impacts the sensitivity to the linear effect of the \(\mathcal{O}_{W}\) operator, which impacts neighboring bins in the centre of the \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\) distribution in opposite directions. It increases the expected limit at 95% CL from \(|c_{W}|<0.2\) to \(|c_{W}|<0.3\). As a cross check, limits are also obtained using the measurement of the electroweak \(Zjj\) cross-section, which is obtained using a data-driven estimate of strong \(Zjj\) production. While this measurement is less affected by the modelling uncertainties of strong \(Zjj\) production, the background estimate introduces additional statistical uncertainties. The resulting limit is almost identical to the one from the nominal analysis.

## 5 Statistical model

The likelihood function used in the interpretation of the four measurements is based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Experimental uncertainties are encoded in a covariance matrix and theory uncertainties are modelled with nuisance parameters constrained by Gaussian distributions.

The predicted differential cross-sections depend on the values of the Wilson coefficients \(\boldsymbol{c}\) that are listed in Table 1 and are also subject to theory systematics, which are parametrized by nuisance parameters. The predicted fiducial cross-section \(x_{b}^{\text{pred}}\) in a bin \(b\) of the unfolded distribution is parametrized as

\[x_{b}^{\text{pred}}\left(\boldsymbol{c},\boldsymbol{\theta}\right)=x_{b}^{ \text{SM}}\left(1+\sum_{i}A_{bi}c_{i}+\sum_{i}B_{bi}c_{i}^{2}+\sum_{i<j}C_{ bij}c_{i}c_{j}\right)\times\prod_{j}^{n_{\text{syst}}}\left(1+\theta_{j}u_{ b\,j}\right), \tag{6}\]where \(x_{b}^{\text{SM}}\) is the nominal SM cross prediction, \(\mathbf{c}\) are the Wilson coefficients, \(\mathbf{\theta}=(\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{n_{\text{phys}}})\) are nuisance parameters, \(n_{\text{syst}}\) is the number of nuisance parameters, and \(u_{bj}\) is the relative size of the theory uncertainty \(j\) in bin \(b\). The terms \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) are introduced in Section 3. Here it is assumed that the nature and relative effect of theory uncertainties in the case of the linear and quadratic SMEFT expansion is the same as for the SM, as explained in Section 3.2.

The nominal measured differential cross-sections of the four processes, in \(n_{\text{bins}}\) bins, are denoted as \(\mathbf{x}\). Statistical and systematic uncertainties of the unfolded data are correlated and encoded in a covariance matrix \(C\). The correlation matrix corresponding to this covariance is visualized in Figure 4. The likelihood \(L\left(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}\right)\), is then given by

\[\begin{split} L\left(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}\right)=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(2\pi\right)^{n_{\text{bins}}}\det\left(C \right)}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta\mathbf{x}^{\top}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta} \right)C^{-1}\Delta\mathbf{x}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}\right)\right)\\ &\times\prod_{i}^{n_{\text{syst}}}f_{i}\left(\theta_{i}\right) \,.\end{split} \tag{7}\]

Here the \(f_{i}\) correspond to the Gaussian constraints on nuisance parameters while the vector \(\Delta\mathbf{x}=\left(\Delta x_{1},\ldots,\Delta x_{n_{\text{bins}}}\right)\) represents the difference between measurement and prediction. The difference between predicted and measured cross-section, \(\Delta x_{b}\), in a given measurement bin \(b\), is defined as

\[\Delta x_{b}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}\right)=x_{b}^{\text{meas}}-x_{b}^{\text{ pred}}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}\right)\,. \tag{8}\]

For the estimation of confidence intervals for a Wilson coefficient \(c_{i}\), a profile likelihood ratio test statistic is constructed from the likelihood:

\[q\left(c_{i}\right)=-2\log\frac{L\left(\mathbf{x}\middle|c_{i},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}} \right)}{L\left(\mathbf{x}\middle|\hat{c}_{i},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)}. \tag{9}\]

Here \(\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\) is the maximum likelihood estimate of the nuisance parameters for a fixed value of \(c_{i}\) while \(\hat{c_{i}}\) and \(\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\) are unconditional maximum likelihood estimates of \(c_{i}\) and the nuisance parameters. Maximum likelihood fits are performed for individual Wilson coefficients by setting other coefficients to zero and maximizing the likelihood with respect to the nuisance parameters. Additionally, simultaneous fits of multiple Wilson coefficients are performed by also profiling other parameters of interest, i.e. maximizing the likelihood with respect to both nuisance parameters and other Wilson coefficients. Confidence intervals are derived using Wilks' theorem [7], assuming that \(q(c_{i})\) is \(\chi^{2}\) distributed.

## 6 Results

Scans of the profile likelihood ratio test statistic defined in Equation 9, which are used to determine confidence intervals on Wilson coefficients, are shown in Figure 5, for two examples. Results for \(c_{W}\) and \(c_{Hq}^{\left(3\right)}\) are shown for the fits of each of the four individual measurements separately and for their combination, while fixing all remaining coefficients to zero.

### Principal component analysis

The focus of this interpretation is the simultaneous measurement of all relevant Wilson coefficients. The measurements contain insufficient information to constrain all coefficients in a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit using the linear SMEFT parametrization. Multiple degrees of freedom are left unconstrained by the data, which manifests as flat directions in the likelihood. Flat and sensitive directions of the likelihood thus need to be identified to increase the numerical stability of the likelihood analysis and to better understand the directions in the space of Wilson coefficients that can be constrained by the combination of the input measurements. To identify these directions, a modified basis that consists of linear combinations of the Warsaw basis vectors is constructed following the methodology of Refs [49, 50].

In order to obtain the modified basis, a simultaneous measurement of the signal strength in each measurement bin is performed using a maximum likelihood fit that employs a statistical model that is identical to the one in Equation 7, except for a replacement of the SMEFT parametrization \(x_{b}^{\text{pred}}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}\right)\) by a signal strength parameter \(\mu_{b}\) for each bin of the measurement:

\[x_{b}^{\text{pred}}\left(\mathbf{\mu},\mathbf{\theta}\right)=\mu_{b}x_{b}^{\text{SM}} \left(1+\theta_{j}u_{jb}\right). \tag{10}\]

The Hessian matrix \(H_{\mu}\) at the minimum of the negative log likelihood of the \(\mu_{b}\) measurement is reparametrized in terms of Wilson coefficients using the linear parametrization matrix \(A\) introduced in Equation 4. The matrix \(A\) relates the signal strength in each bin to a linear combination of Wilson coefficients. This allows to obtain the Hessian matrix in the space of Wilson coefficients, \(H_{\text{SMEFT}}\), from the Hessian matrix \(H_{\mu}\) in \(\mu_{b}\) space:

\[H_{\text{SMEFT}}=A^{\text{T}}H_{\mu}A. \tag{11}\]

The leading 16 eigenvectors of this 33\(\times\)33 matrix are listed in Figure 6. In the Gaussian limit, measurements of these eigenvectors are uncorrelated and the corresponding eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are related to the expected

These results are obtained while fixing all remaining Wilson coefficients to zero. \(\Lambda=1\) TeV is assumed. In the limit of Wilks’ theorem crossing points of the profile likelihood curves with the dashed lines correspond to borders of the 68% and 95% confidence intervals.

uncertainty \(\sigma\) of a measurement in direction of the eigenvector:

\[\sigma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}} \tag{12}\]

With scans of the profile likelihood it is validated that the eigenvectors are indeed uncorrelated and that the expected uncertainty matches the one obtained from the full likelihood analysis. The eigenvector with the lowest uncertainty (i.e. eigenvector nr. 0 in Figure 6) and thus the best sensitivity is approximately given by

\[c^{\prime}_{0}\approx 0.88c_{lq}^{(3)}-0.37c_{lq}^{(1)}-0.21\,c_{eu}-0.12\,c_{ qe}+0.11\,c_{Hq}^{(3)}-0.10c_{lu}, \tag{13}\]

corresponding to an expected uncertainty of \(\sigma=0.0295\), and introducing a strong enhancement of the differential cross-section in the highest energy bins of the \(WW\), \(WZ\), and \(4\ell\) measurements, driven by the effect of four-fermion operators. The same notation is used for basis vectors and coefficients.

In order to improve the interpretability of the measurement, parameter groups are defined that each contain Wilson coefficients with a similar physics impact. The coefficient \(c_{W}\) is treated as its own subgroup, as its physics effect is unique in that it only affects weak-boson self-couplings. \(c_{Hq}^{(3)}\) is also its own subgroup, as it is closely aligned to eigenvector nr. 1, which can be measured very precisely. \(c_{HWB}\), \(c_{HD}\), \(c_{HI}^{(1)}\), \(c_{HI}^{(3)}\), \(c_{He}\), \(c_{ll}^{(1)}\), \(c_{Hq}^{(1)}\), \(c_{Hu}\), and \(c_{Hd}\) form a third group. In the context of this analysis, the main effect of these operators corresponds to a modification of the coupling of vector bosons to fermions, which is why directions in this subspace are labelled \(c_{V\,ff}^{\{i\}}\). Together with \(c_{Hq}^{(3)}\), operators of this group can be tightly constrained from electroweak precision data, for example from measurements at the \(Z\) pole. The final two groups correspond to four-fermion operators that include both lepton and quark fields and four-quark operators. Directions in these subspaces are labelled \(c_{2I2q}^{\prime\{i\}}\) and \(c_{4q}^{\prime\{i\}}\), respectively. Eigenvectors of the new

The first column to the table lists the rank of the eigenvector and the second column the expected uncertainty. Only eigenvectors with an expected uncertainty of less than 10 are shown. The components of eigenvectors are rounded to the second decimal place. In the Gaussian limit, measurements of these eigenvectors are uncorrelated and the corresponding eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are related to the expected uncertainty \(\sigma\) of a measurement in direction of the eigenvector by \(\sigma=1/\sqrt{\lambda}\).

grouping are shown in Figure 7. The impact of variations of the fit parameters \(c^{\prime}_{j}\) on the measured signal strength is shown in Figure 8.

Eigenvectors that correspond to expected uncertainties of greater than 5 are set to zero. As Wilson coefficients are expected to be of order 1, these directions in parameter space have very little impact on the measurement. The removal of these weakly constrained directions allows to measure the remaining coefficients simultaneously in a maximum likelihood fit.

### Results of the combined fit

Measurements of the 15 sensitive directions are performed using both the linear and the linear-plus-quadratic SMEFT parametrization. Each sensitive direction is fitted separately while keeping the remaining parameters fixed at zero (individual fit) as well as in profiled fits in which the likelihood is minimized with respect to the remaining parameters. Constraints on eigenvectors of the operator subgroups are shown in Figure 9 and Table 3. Differences between the linear and linear-plus-quadratic results, which are sizeable in some cases, indicate that \(O(\Lambda^{-4})\) effects are important, which is potentially indicative of an invalidity of

The first column of the table lists the label of the eigenvector and the second column the expected uncertainty. Only eigenvectors with an expected uncertainty of less than 5 are shown. The components of eigenvectors are rounded to the second decimal place. In the Gaussian limit, measurements of these eigenvectors are uncorrelated and the corresponding eigenvalues \(\lambda\) are related to the expected uncertainty \(\sigma\) of a measurement in direction of the eigenvector by \(\sigma=1/\sqrt{\lambda}\).

Figure 8: Impact of the seven most sensitive fit directions on the differential cross-sections included in the SMEFT interpretation, relative to the SM cross-section. The linear effect of each operator, due to its interference with SM, is indicated by the red line while the quadratic dimension-six effect is shown as a dashed green line. The blue line corresponds to the SM-expectation. In order to illustrate experimental uncertainty to these effects in data, the measurement uncertainty is shown as a grey band. \(\Lambda=1\) TeV is assumed and the values of Wilson coefficients are chosen such that the impact of all operators corresponds approximately to the \(2\sigma\) sensitivity from a fit to the SMEFT model with linear terms only.

Figure 9: Confidence intervals for the 15 parameters included in the combined maximum likelihood fit. Results are quoted both for fits linear in the parameters and for fits that take into account also quadratic contributions. The first case corresponds to a model in which only the \(O(\Lambda^{-2})\) contributions to the cross-section prediction, the interference between SM and dimension-six operators, is included. The latter case also includes quadratic dimension-six contributions, which are part of the \(O(\Lambda^{-4})\) contributions. Comparisons of the two results can be used to estimate uncertainties due to the truncation of the EFT expansion. Confidence intervals obtained for individual parameters, while fixing other parameters to zero, are furthermore compared with the results from the combined fit, in which the remaining 14 parameters are profiled.

Constraints, in particular in the direction of the \(y\)-axis parameters, are comparatively weak and thus of limited physical meaning.

## 7 Conclusion

A combined SMEFT interpretation of four measurements is presented, a measurement of \(WW\) production in the \(e^{\pm}\nu\mu^{\mp}\nu\) final state [3], a measurement of \(WZ\) production in the \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{\pm}\nu\) final state [4], a measurement of four-lepton production [5], and a \(Z(\ell\ell)jj\) measurement in VBF topology [6]. The measurements are based on 36-139 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV.

The combination is sensitive to 33 Warsaw basis operators. Constraints are obtained on two Wilson coefficients, \(c_{Hq}^{(3)}\) and \(c_{W}\), and 13 additional linear combinations of Wilson coefficients. The measurement is performed using both a linear model and one that also includes effects quadratic in the Wilson coefficients. Assuming \(\Lambda=1\) TeV, \(c_{Hq}^{(3)}\), \(c_{W}\), and five additional linear combinations of Wilson coefficients can be constrained with a precision of better than 1 in a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit of 15 parameters. The degrees of freedom not included in the fit correspond to directions in parameter space that only have a small impact on the studied processes.

The combination with additional measurements is required to improve the observed constraints. The constraint on \(c_{Hq}^{(3)}\) is driven by the \(WZ\) measurement and can be improved with a measurement of the process that utilizes the full Run 2 dataset. An inclusion of electroweak precision measurements on the \(Z\) resonance [53] could further improve constraints on Wilson coefficients, both directly and by reducing correlations between Wilson coefficient in the fit. The combination with measurements of high-mass Drell-Yan and \(W\) boson production is required to further constrain four-fermion operators, which would also improve constraints for some of the other operators studied in this note.

Together with the combined SMEFT interpretation of Higgs boson measurements [50] and the combination of \(H(WW^{*})\) and \(WW\) measurements [54] this work constitutes an additional step towards an ATLAS global SMEFT interpretation. The data and some of the predictions used in this work are available on HEPdata3 and Rivet routines also exist4, which allows to perform similar re-interpretations outside the ATLAS collaboration.
