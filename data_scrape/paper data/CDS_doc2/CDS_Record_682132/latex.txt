**4-lepton Signature in Gluino Pair Production**

**Abstract**

The possible 4-lepton signature to search for gluino pair production at LHC is studied. This signature comes from the production of several \(Z\)'s in the gluino cascade decay, followed by their leptonic decays. It is shown, that for ATLAS it is possible to observe such events for favourable sets of SUSY parameters provided an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\ pb^{-1}\) will be collected. The dominant background from \(ZZ\)-continuum production and \(t\overline{t}\) production become negligible after selection cuts. Events with the same signature would be observed, if the probability of \(t\)-quark Neutral Current decay \(t\)\(\rightarrow\)\(Z+c\) would exceed \(10^{-3}\).

Cascade decays of heavy gluinos include decays between neutralinos and between same sign charginos. In these decays multiple \(Z\)'s can be produced. This leads to a possible signature for supersymmetry, which consists of four high-\(P_{T}\) isolated leptons, from \(Z\) decays, and several hard jets. For the preliminary results of studies of this signature see [1].

Different values of SUSY parameters will give different masses to gaugino-higgsino mixed states and also different couplings of them to other particles. The inclusive branching ratio for \(\tilde{g}\!\rightarrow\!Z+X\) strongly depends on the exact choice of the parameters.

We have considered the following decay modes:

1) \(\tilde{g}\!\rightarrow\!\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}+X\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\!\rightarrow\!Z+\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\),

2) \(\tilde{g}\!\rightarrow\!\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{3}+X\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{3}\!\rightarrow\!Z+\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) or \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{3}\!\rightarrow\!Z+\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\),

3) \(\tilde{g}\!\rightarrow\!\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{4}+X\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{4}\!\rightarrow\!Z+\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) or \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{4}\!\rightarrow\!Z+\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) or \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{4}\!\rightarrow\!Z+\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{3}\),

4) \(\tilde{g}\!\rightarrow\!\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{2}+X\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{2}\!\rightarrow\!Z+\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\).

Different sets of SUSY parameters have been tried. Figure 1 shows the inclusive branching ratio for \(\tilde{g}\tilde{g}\!\rightarrow\!ZZ+X\) for \(M_{\tilde{g}}=400\), 600, 800 and 1000 GeV, for \(\tan\beta=2\), 4, 6 and 10 as a function of the \(\mu\) parameter. Other parameters were fixed as: \(M_{\tilde{q}}=2M_{\tilde{g}}\), mass of charged Higgs \(M^{\pm}=500\) GeV, \(M_{top}=140\) GeV. For each gluino mass the discussed branching ratio strongly depends on the \(\mu\) parameter, and it usually increases with increasing \(M_{\tilde{g}}\). For a heavy gluino (\(M_{\tilde{g}}>600\) GeV) the large difference between \(\tan\beta=2\) and \(\tan\beta\geq 4\) values for large values of \(\mu\) is connected with the opening of the significant channel \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\!\rightarrow\!Z+\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\). The branching ratios for this decay mode and also for modes listed above are shown in Figures 2-12 as a function of the \(\mu\) parameter for \(M_{\tilde{g}}=400\), 600, 800 and 1000 GeV and for several \(\tan\beta\) values.

To study the 4-lepton signature we have chosen \(\tan\beta=2\), \(\mu=\) -200 GeV, \(M_{\tilde{g}}=800\) GeV and \(M_{\tilde{q}}=1.6\) TeV. The branching ratio for \(\tilde{g}\tilde{g}\!\rightarrow\!ZZ+X\) is 4% for these particular parameter values. The value chosen is not one corresponding to the largest branching ratio, but it is one of the favourable choices possible for this channel, which yields a detectable amount of events.

The cross section for 800 GeV gluino pair production is 2.35 pb. For an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\) there will be \(9\cdot 10^{3}\) events in which a \(ZZ\) pair is produced. Taking into account the 3.3% branching ratio for \(Z\!\rightarrow\!e^{+}e^{-}\) (and the same for \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)) we expect 40 events in the 4-\(e\), 4-\(\mu\) and 2\(e\)2\(\mu\) channels.

The main backgrounds to this signal will be \(ZZ\) continuum production, followed by leptonic decays of the \(Z\) bosons and \(t\bar{t}\) production followed by semileptonic decays of the \(t\) and \(b\) quarks.

We have used the ISASUSY [2] Monte Carlo to generate signal events and PYTHIA [3] for the background event generation. ISASUSY includes complete set of decay patterns of supersymmetric particles, so more complicated decay modes than those mentioned above have also been taken into account. For \(Z\) particles decay modes \(Z\!\rightarrow\!e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(Z\!\rightarrow\!\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) have been forced both for signal and \(ZZ\)-continuum background. As for \(t\bar{t}\) background, the existing sample of \(t\bar{t}\) production generated by G.Polesello was used. In this sample one of the \(W\)'s was forced to decay semileptonically (to \(e\), \(\mu\) or \(\tau\) ).

The detector response was simulated by smearing particle energies with the expected ATLAS resolution, i.e. for electromagnetic calorimetry we assume \(\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{10\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 1\%\), for hadronic calorimeter resolution we use \(\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{50\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 2\%\), in both cases the analysis has been based on granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.05\times 0.05\). Leptons are considered in the range \(|\eta|<2.5\). For isolation we use the criterium of less than 5 GeV \(E_{T}\) hadronic calorimeter response in the cone \(\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}<0.3\) around the lepton direction. For jet reconstruction we used \(|\eta|<3\) range while for \(\mbox{E}_{T}^{miss}\)calculations \(|\eta|<5\) range was used. No pile-up effect has been considered.

To extract the signal from the background we used the following kinematical criteria:

(1) The event is required to have at least 4 jets with \(E_{T}>50\) GeV.

(2) The hardest jet in the event has \(E_{T}>200\) GeV.

(3) The second hardest jet in the event has \(E_{T}>100\) GeV.

The normalised distributions of these variables are shown in the Figure 13 for the signal, and for the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(ZZ\)-continuum background. Normalization of these distributions corresponds to the amount of events (with mentioned branching ratios) per 1 \(pb^{-1}\). It is clearly seen that the applied kinematical cuts are efficient for the signal while they strongly suppress the background especially from \(ZZ\)-continuum production. As a result of applying these cuts, the cross section of gluino pair production falls from 2.35 pb to 2.09 pb, while for \(t\bar{t}\) (with at least one \(W\) decaying semileptonically) - from 1750 pb to 60 pb. For \(ZZ\)-continuum background (when both \(Z\)'s decay into electrons and muons) the cross section falls from \(6\cdot 10^{-2}\) to \(2\cdot 10^{-5}\) pb.

The other selection criteria consists of requiring four isolated leptons in the event and reconstructing two \(Z\)'s. The \(E_{T}\) distributions of the four hardest isolated leptons in the event (provided they have \(E_{T}>10\) GeV) are shown in the Figures 14-16 for gluino pair production and for background events. For the gluino-gluino events with several \(Z\)'s leptons should have even more spectra, than it is shown in the Figure 14 (where the most of events have no \(Z\) at all). It may be seen from Figure 17, where events with two reconstructed \(Z\)'s are shown. We used the following cuts:

(4) The event is required to have at least 4 isolated leptons with \(E_{T}>10\) GeV, at least two of them should have \(E_{T}>20\) GeV (for trigger purposes). (5) There should be at least two \(ee\) or \(\mu\mu\) combinations with invariant mass \(|M_{ll}-M_{Z}|<6\) GeV.

For \(ZZ\)-continuum background it is relatively easy to produce isolated leptons in the \(|\eta|<2.5\) range, so criteria (4) and (5) will not give a significant reduction of \(ZZ\) background events. One notes that the isolation cut is 100% efficient for this type of events. The result of applying all (1)-(5) criteria to the \(ZZ\) background finally gives a cross section of \((1.2\pm 1.2)\cdot 10^{-5}\) pb. It should be emphasized that \(ZZ\)-continuum production has soft \(\mbox{E}_{T}^{miss}\)distribution (more than 85% events have \(\mbox{$\rm E${}_{T}^{miss}$}\!<40\) GeV, see for example Figure 20), so all background events should have \(\mbox{$\rm E${}_{T}^{miss}$}\!<100\) GeV. Taking into account that gluon-gluon interactions may give additional factor of 1.3-1.5 in \(ZZ\) -production cross section (PYTHIA in this case deals with quarks only), we may expect 0.3 event with \(\mbox{$\rm E${}_{T}^{miss}$}\!>40\) GeV coming from \(ZZ\) -continuum background for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\).

For \(t\bar{t}\) -events \(W\)'s from the decay \(t\!\!\rightarrow\!\!W+b\) will easily give isolated leptons if decaying semileptonically. Leptons that come from \(b\)-quark decay are much more associated with jets, so the probability to find two more isolated leptons in such events should be small. We have found 1 event with 4 isolated leptons (with \(E_{T}>10\) GeV) in the available sample. But this sample itself consists of 4 slices with different statistics, so we cannot get reliable estimates on 4-lepton cross section directly from the Monte Carlo. If we suppose that the probability to find an isolated lepton remains the same for the third and for the fourth lepton (it is natural if those leptons basically come from \(b\) -quark decays in independent jets), then we may expect a cross section after applying cut (4) of \(1.2\cdot 10^{-2}\) pb for \(t\bar{t}\) events. Lepton pairs in these events have a wide distribution of invariant mass (see Figures 18,19), so the \(Z\) mass reconstruction gives an additional strong rejection. The cut (4) plus 1 reconstructed \(Z\) leaves \(2.7\cdot 10^{-4}\) pb, kinematical cuts (1)-(3) additionally decrease cross section to \(5\cdot 10^{-6}\) pb. If releasing the isolation requirement, the cross section before \(\mbox{$\rm E${}_{T}^{miss}$}\) cuts is \((10.0\pm 6.0)\cdot 10^{-4}\) pb., and if cutting at \(\mbox{$\rm E${}_{T}^{miss}$}\) larger than 40 or 100 GeV the cross section is \((5.1\pm 2.5)\cdot 10^{-4}\)pb. and \((1.3\pm 1.3)\cdot 10^{-4}\) pb. respectively. The requirement of the second reconstructed \(Z\) in the event makes the cross section negligible. It should be mentioned here that the probability of finding the third (and more) isolated leptons in \(t\bar{t}\) events strongly depends on the \(E_{T}\) of the lepton (see Figure 15). For \(E_{T}>15\) GeV the \(t\bar{t}\) background cross section falls down by an extra order of magnitude, while signal remains almost the same (20 % less).

We have not imposed any requirements on lepton sign identification. If we require opposite sign leptons for cut (5), it does not affect the signal and \(ZZ\)-background, while it slightly decreases \(t\bar{t}\) background which is already very small.

In principle the other possible background source is Neutral Current decays of \(t\) -quarks, \(t\!\!\rightarrow\!Z+c\). The probability of this decay of \(10^{-3}\) will lead to 1 event with discussed signature for integrated luminosity \(10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\).

The result of applying cuts (1)-(5) to \(\tilde{g}\tilde{g}\) events leads to a final cross section of \((1.3\pm 0.3)\cdot 10^{-4}\) pb. These events will have wide \(\mbox{$\rm E${}_{T}^{miss}$}\)distribution (see Figure 20) with a mean value of about 160 GeV. The background cross section is estimated to be less than \(3\cdot 10^{-6}\) pb for \(\mbox{$\rm E${}_{T}^{miss}$}\!>40\) GeV. The acceptance the ATLAS detector to signal events is about 30% for these particular parameter values. Releasing the isolation requirement for the leptons give a signal cross section of \((4.0\pm 0.5)\cdot 10^{-4}\) pb. before any requirement on \(\mbox{$\rm E${}_{T}^{miss}$}\). If requiring \(\mbox{$\rm E${}_{T}^{miss}$}\) of 40 GeV this reduces to \((3.8\pm 0.5)\cdot 10^{-4}\)pb., while at \(\mbox{$\rm E${}_{T}^{miss}$}\!>100\) GeV the cross section is \((3.1\pm 0.5)\cdot 10^{-4}\)pb. We have also tested another set of parameters with \(\mu\) = -100 GeV, \(M_{\tilde{g}}\) = 500 GeV. In this case the efficiency of ATLAS detector to signal events decreased to \(\approx 20\) %. It should be emphasized that we assumed the 100 % lepton detection efficiency. For the ATLAS detector this value is expected to be of order of 90 % that will give the extra reduction of the signal (and background) events by a factor of 0.65.

Figures 21,22 shows the expected amount of signal events (without correction to the efficiency) for integrated luminosity \(10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\) for two reference values of \(\tan\beta\) = 4 and 10. Com

binations of the parameters, which are excluded by present data, are not shown.

We conclude that for a favourable set of SUSY parameters a signal in the 4-lepton channel can be detected with the ATLAS detector provided an integrated luminosity of at least \(10^{5}\ pb^{-1}\) is collected.
