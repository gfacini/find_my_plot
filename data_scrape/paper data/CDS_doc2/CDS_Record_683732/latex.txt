## Risk of damaging the wires by edges of laser drilled holes in the end plugs

We have tested two tubes with Protvino end plugs. Previously the tubes had been treated for the mechanical acceptance test in the following way:

Temperature cycle 10 times at 1 bar, amplitude between 15 and 40 degrees C, step time = hours (i.e. the time it takes to heat or cool a tube).

Tension cycle: amplitude 7% of wire tension, equivalent to a vibration of the wire (24 hours) near its maximum amplitude (wire touches tube).

They were also submitted to a high voltage test and did not show discharges or currents beyond 5 nA (the sensitivity of the instrument).

We have checked the wire in the region of the Protvino laser drilled hole with an microscope (magnifying factor 100 and 180) and with an electron microscope (magnifying factor 1500)

Three out of the four wires have shown no visible damage at all in the active tube volume close to the laser drilled holes. We investigated the first 5 mm wire length from the hole.

One wire has shown an abrasion (20 \(\upmu\)m x 20 \(\upmu\)m) close to the laser drilled hole, the depth of the abrasion is less than 5 \(\upmu\)m (see Figure 1).

#### Risk of damaging the wires by edges of laser drilled holes in the end plugs

On two wires, we have seen mechanical defects of the gold layer in the inactive zone close to the end of the brass tube making the connection to the outside (see drawing of the Protvino end plug) close to the end of the brass tube (see Figure 2). Most likely this defects happened during the preparation of the wire for our measurement (we have to pull the wire out of the crimp with quite some force) and not during the production of the end plug.

In conclusion, we have seen no sign of damage to the wire by edges of the laser drilled hole, based on a sample of four end plugs.
