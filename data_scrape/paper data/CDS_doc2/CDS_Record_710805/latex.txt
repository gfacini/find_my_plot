Higgs boson production with decay into \(\tau\)-lepton pair will be one of the key final state signature for the possible discovery at LHC collider. Depending on the assumed model, Standard Model or Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, different production mechanisms will contribute to the discovery potential. It is therefore important to study the sensitivity of the signal reconstruction efficiency on the topological features of the production mechanisms. Quantitative discussion is presented for the Higgs boson mass of 120 GeV and ATLAS detector at LHC.

Introduction

The search for the Higgs boson is one of the primary task of the ATLAS experiment at LHC. It has been already established by several studies [1, 2, 3], that the Standard Model Higgs and Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model Higgs can be discovered with high significance over the full mass range of interest.

One of the key final state signature is Higgs boson decaying into \(\tau\)-leptons.

For the MSSM Higgs scenario, decay into \(\tau\)-pair is strongly enhanced at large \(\tan\beta\), one of the parameters of the supersymmetric models. The promising production mechanism is the enhanced production in association with the b-quarks or the inclusive gluon-gluon fusion [3, 4] (depending on the Higgs boson mass and \(\tan\beta\) range.) The analyses prepared for the MSSM Higgs bosons H and A searches discuss only lepton-hadron (or hadron-hadron at large masses) decay mode of the \(\tau\)-pair as the relevant signature. The contribution from the lepton-lepton mode to the discovery potential has been declared as negligible already some time ago [5]. Also, in the MSSM oriented analyses, it was considered as very optimistic to claim any discovery potential for the Higgs boson mass below 140 GeV, due to the large, overwhelming and difficult to control experimentally irreducible background from the Drell-Yan \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) production.

Recently has been shown, [6], that the production in the vector boson fusion will be very promising in the Standard Model scenario for the Higgs mass of 110 GeV - 140 GeV and the \(H\to\tau\tau\) decay channel. Although discovery potential in the lepton-hadron channel is superior over lepton-lepton ones, the second one nevertheless provides important contribution. The discovery potential could be improved even by 40%, with respect to the one estimated with lepton-hadron channel only. This analysis can be reinterpreted for the MSSM scenario and light Higgs bosons h. It brings complementary coverage of the \((m_{A},\tan\beta)\) parameter space to already discussed \(gg\to h\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(t\overline{t}H,H\to b\bar{b}\) channels.

It seems therefore well justified to reconsider potential of the lepton-lepton mode also for the discovery in the MSSM scenario for the H and A bosons and for the different production mechanisms, to understand in details differences and similarities in the overall reconstruction efficiencies for the SM and MSSM oriented analyses for the Higgs boson mass below 150 GeV. It concerns both reconstruction of the signal signature and of the resonant irreducible Drell-Yan \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) background. In this paper we discuss just reconstruction aspects, full analysis of the observability potential will be presented elsewhere [7].

It should be emphasized that the complete calculations embedded in the Monte Carlo generator for the Yukawa induced Higgs boson production in the \(b\bar{b}H\) coupling is not available so far. The inclusive cross-section is dominated by the bottom-quark fusion hard process \(b\bar{b}\to H\), as originally discussed in [8]. Recently remarkable progress has been achieved in the theoretical description of the total integrated cross-section. The total inclusive cross-section for the Yukawa induced Higgs boson production in the \(b\bar{b}H\) coupling, the \(b\bar{b}\to H\), has been evaluated to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) [9]. The NNLO calculations shows almost no scale dependence. The inclusive cross-section was also obtained at next-to-leading order via fixed order calculations for the hard process \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}H\)[10]. The obtained results are compatible with the \(b\bar{b}\to H\) at NNLO, and show that there is actually no large discrepancy between the NLO fixed order calculationsand the use of the b-quark structure functions. This turned out to be contrary to what discussed since long time. Results of the fixed order calculation have a substantial scale dependence and a better control of the residual large uncertainties was mandatory for complete understanding of the comparison between the two approaches. Discussing what is the relevant subprocess for the analyses, as designed in [1], one can argue that if the identified final state has one high \(p_{T}\) bottom quark, the relevant should be \(gb\to bH\) hard process [11]. The cross-section for \(gb\to bH\) hard process has been also computed at NLO [12] and the residual uncertainties due to higher order corrections are small.

Although several new NLO and even NNLO calculations became available for the integrated cross-sections, only _LO matrix element + parton shower_ approach is available for events generation. The three different hard processes: the (\(2\to 1\)) process \(b\overline{b}\to H\), the (\(2\to 2\)) process \(gb\to bH\) and the (\(2\to 3\)) process \(gg,q\overline{q}\to bbH\) can be used alternatively for evaluating Yukawa induced Higgs boson production in the \(b\overline{b}H\) coupling. As we will argue in this paper the proposed reconstruction steps are very sensitive to the topology of the signal production process. The good theoretical modeling and understanding of the possible control channels will be therefore mandatory for the convincing experimental evidence. Those problems need still be addressed from the perspective of the experimental analyses.

For the comparative study presented in this paper we decided to discuss SM-like Higgs boson of the mass 120 GeV. We compare quantitatively reconstruction efficiencies and final resolution figures for different production mechanisms and for both, lepton-lepton and lepton-hadron modes. We discuss also respective irreducible Drell-Yan \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) backgrounds.

## 2 Reconstruction of the basic experimental signatures

Reconstruction of the basic experimental signatures: leptons, \(\tau\)-jets, missing energy have been done with the fast simulation of the ATLAS detector, package ATLFAST-2.0 [13]. This simulation provides parametrized response of the crucial detector performance figures, based on detailed GEANT simulation [1]. Although to large extent it is representing the _best performance_ of the detector, we believe that it is fairly adequate for the comparative studies presented in this paper.

The key experimental issues, which are relevant for discussed analyses are shortly summarized below:

* Both discussed channels have leptons (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) in the final state and can be triggered by either single or the dilepton trigger. The ATLAS trigger acceptance covers the region of \(|\eta|<2.5\) for electrons and \(|\eta|<2.2\) for muons. The respective transverse momenta thresholds are 20 GeV for muons and 25 GeV for electrons. For dilepton trigger respective thresholds are 10 GeV (for \(\mu\mu\) pair) and 15 GeV (for \(ee\) pair).
* It is assumed that in the ATLAS experiment, electrons and muons can be reconstructed in the pseudorapidity range of \(|\eta|<2.5\), with an efficiency of 90%.
* It is assumed that hadronically decaying \(\tau\)'s can be identified over the same range of pseudorapidity. The important ingredient in the \(\tau\)-jet identification is the profile of the energy deposition in calorimeter and the number of tracks pointing to the calorimeter cluster. The \(\tau\) reconstruction efficiency is correlated with the rejection on non-\(\tau\) jets [14].
* Missing energy is calculated after summing up all reconstructed visible signatures in the final states, including also cells and clusters in the calorimeter.

For more detailed discussion on the comparison between full and fast simulations results, which are relevant for this analysis, see [1] and [3].

For presented here analysis we have completed parametrisations for jet energy calibration existing in [13] by the dedicated parametrisations for the statistical energy calibration of \(\tau\)-jets. Detailed discussion can be found in the Appendix of this paper.

## 3 Different production mechanisms

For the signal we consider three production mechanisms which could contribute, in the discussed mass range, to the discovery potential for the Standard Model and/or the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model:

* The production mechanism via gluon fusion \(gg\to H\), dominant in the SM. This is so called _direct Higss production_ process.
* The production mechanism in association of the b-quarks, \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}H\). This is so called _associated Higgs production_ process. This production is almost negligible in the Standard Model scenarios but could be strongly enhanced in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model scenarios. The characteristic topology comes with the presence of the pair of rather soft b-quarks in the final state. In fact we will discuss later three different approaches for generation of physics events which explores Yukawa b-quark coupling to the Higgs boson (so b-quark fusion).
* The production mechanism in the vector boson fusion, the _VBF production_\(q\bar{q}\to Hq\bar{q}\). This production contributes on the level of 20% of the direct production at the mass of 120 GeV of the Higgs boson. The characteristic topology comes with the presence of the pair of forward/backward quarks with large rapidity gaps.

The purpose of the presented here discussion is to quantify the impact of the different production topologies on the quality of signal reconstruction, not so much to embarque in the discussion on the theoretical precision of the Monte Carlo predictions for different production mechanisms.

For events generation we have used PYTHIA 6.2 Monte Carlo generator [15] with CTEQ5L structure functions parametrisation. Table 1 gives cross-section for \(\ell\ell E_{T}^{miss}\) final state (single flavour lepton), for signal and dominant resonant background from \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) production. The value of the branching ratio of \(BR(\tau\to\ell\nu\nu)=0.175\) was used for the calculations. The irreducible background comes from the \(q\bar{q}\to Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) production. However, for the same lepton flavour final state (SF), also directly produced \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) will be an overwhelming background at the production level. For not the same flavour final state, (NSF), the direct \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) will contribute only marginally.

Fig. 1 shows the transverse momenta distribution of the Higgs boson as generated with different production mechanisms. The average \(<p_{T}^{Higgs}>\) distribution for \(H\) production is of 35 GeV, for the \(gg\to b\bar{b}H\) production is 28 GeV and for the \(qqH\) production is of 82 GeV. Observed higher average transverse momenta in the \(gg\to H\) production than in the \(gg\to b\bar{b}H\) production is probably a direct consequence of modeling for the QCD ISR radiation, as implemented in the Monte Carlo generator. For the \(gg\to H\) production implemented is the so called _improved parton shower model_[16], contrary to the case of the \(gg\to b\bar{b}H\) process, for which the simple parton shower model is only available. As already widely discussed in [1, 17] the \(<p_{T}^{Higgs}>\) distribution has a direct impact on the efficiency for signal reconstruction. It will be therefore very important to have precise theoretical understanding and predictions for its shape.

The decay of the \(\tau\)-leptons have been handled by the TAUOLA[18] and PHOTOS[19] packages, interfaced to the generation framework using interface presented in [20]. This setup is allowing for correct simulation of the \(\tau\)-decays and the radiative photons emission from the cascade, relevant in particular for the hadron-lepton mode. Also it takes properly into account spin correlations effects in the Higgs boson (scalar) and Z-boson (vector) decays.

## 4 The \(\ell\ell E_{T}^{miss}\) final state

### Selection criteria

We start with selection procedure as defined in [5] for the lepton-lepton final state. The so called _basic selection_ consists of requiring:

* 2 isolated leptons with \(p_{T}^{\ell}>15\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(\eta^{\,\ell}<2.5\)
* Threshold on the minimal angular separation between leptons, \(|sin(\Delta\,\phi_{\ell\ell})|>0.2\)
* Reconstructed missing transverse energy \(p_{T}^{miss}>15\) GeV.
* Resolved neutrinos from the linear equation system.

To reconstruct invariant mass of the \(\tau\)-lepton system we need to resolve neutrinos 4-momenta. This is made under assumption that the \(\tau\)-lepton is massless and decays collinearly. Two different formulas have been proposed and used since some time:

* If \(E_{1}\), \(E_{2}\) are the energies and \(\hat{u}_{1}\), \(\hat{u}_{2}\) the directions of measured visible \(\tau\)-decay products, and if \(p_{x}^{miss}\), \(p_{y}^{miss}\) are the projections onto the \(x\), \(y\) axes of the measured \(p_{T}^{miss}\), then the energies \(E_{\nu_{1}}\) and \(E_{\nu_{2}}\) of the neutrino systems from \(\tau\)-decay can be obtained by resolving the system: \[p_{x}^{miss}(p_{y}^{miss})=(E_{\nu_{1}}\cdot\hat{u}_{1})_{x,(y)}+(E_{\nu_{2}} \cdot\hat{u}_{2})_{x,(y)}.\] (1) The measurement accuracy of \(p_{x}^{miss}\) and \(p_{y}^{miss}\) and the assumptions used result in many cases in unphysical negative solutions for \(E_{\nu_{1}}\) and \(E_{\nu_{2}}\). Such events are dropped from the analysis. This procedure follows prescription used in [5].
* Fractions of the two \(\tau^{\prime}s\) momenta which are carried by measured visible decay products, \(x_{\tau_{1}}\), \(x_{\tau_{2}}\), can be calculated from solving equations of conservation of the transverse momenta in the Higgs decay. The physical solutions are those for which \(0<x_{\tau_{1}},x_{\tau_{2}}<1\). For such cases the invariant mass of the system of the visible decay products is calculated and the invariant mass of the \(\tau\)-system is expressed as \[m_{\tau\tau}=m_{vis}/\sqrt{x_{\tau_{1}}\cdot x_{\tau_{2}}}\] (2) This procedure follows prescription used in [21].

It was shown already in [3], that ones only physical solution are considered both approaches are equivalent and lead to the same acceptance and shape of the reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\). Our studies performed here confirm this conclusion. In [21], an additional requirement of \((x_{\tau_{1}}^{2}+x_{\tau_{1}}^{2})<1\) has been used, but we found that this requirement is not improving mass resolution but is only leading to an additional loss of signal acceptances.

The \(p_{T}^{miss}>15\) GeV selection is definitively too low for studies done with the fast simulation. This threshold should be raised to at least 30 GeV, for consistencies with analyses made previously we keep nevertheless low threshold for the _basic_ selection.

We have also applied some additional selection, following what proposed in [21]. The primary aim was to improve the mass resolution without loosing too many of signal events.

As shown latter, this additional selection indeed visibly improves mass resolution, at rather small loss of the signal acceptance.

For the case of same flavour leptons (SF) somewhat more stringent selection, directly oriented toward suppressing potentially overwhelming Drell-Yan \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) background is adopted. For events with not-same flavour leptons (NSF) this background can be considered as negligible.

### Signal reconstruction

Table 2 gives cumulated acceptances for the selection described above. After _basic_ selection (following what proposed in [5]), acceptance for the VBF produced Higgs boson is more than two times higher than for the direct production. Just kinematics of those events is more favourable with the average transverse momenta of the Higgs boson being much higher in this case. The less favourable for the reconstruction is kinematics of the associated production, resulting in the lowest acceptance of all production mechanisms discussed in Table 2. The similar behaviour is observed after adding an _additional_ selection and also after adding selection for case of the SF events.

After _basic_ selection acceptance for the VBF produced Higgs boson is 2.5 times higher than for the direct production and almost four times higher than for the associated production. After additional selection these ratios are even higher. The SF selection (increased threshold on \(p_{T}^{miss}\)) suppresses much more the \(gg\to H\) and \(b\overline{b}H\) produced Higgs. Acceptance for the VBF production becomes more than 10 times higher than for the associated production.

The shaded (yellow) area will be accepted by the respective selection. Distributions normalised to total \(\sigma\times BR\) [pb]._

In Fig. 2 we show distributions for some of the kinematical variables used during events selection: \(sin(\Delta\phi_{\ell,\ell})\), \(p_{T}^{miss}\), \(cos(\Delta\phi_{\ell,\ell})\) and \(m_{\ell,\ell}\). One can clearly observe different angular correlations between visible decay products, related to the average transverse momenta of the Higgs system for a given production mechanism. This is the most outstanding favourable effect for the higher acceptance in the VBF production. The second noticeable effect is the higher acceptance for the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) selection and efficiency for resolving neutrino system for the \(gg\to H\) production with respect to the associated \(gg\to bbH\) production.

Please note also that the invariant mass of the visible decay products is well localised and far from the Z-peak. It will facilitate needed high suppression against Drell-Yan \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) background for the SF leptons. In contrast with the invariant mass of the \(\tau\)-system, the invariant mass of the system of visible decay products (leptons) can be quite precisely reconstructed.

### Background reconstruction

Table 3 shows acceptances for the Drell-Yan \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) backgrounds. The \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) background will obviously contribute only to the SF signature. After basic selection, acceptance for the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) is almost five times lower, after additional selection almost ten times lower. The very efficient suppression comes already from the \(cos(\Delta\phi_{\ell,\ell})\) and \(p_{T}^{miss}\) selection. It is however still not sufficient, given the fact that the initial ratio of the cross-sections is of 30. Please note that the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) events reconstructed with the \(\tau\tau\) hypothesis will not peak at the Z-boson nominal mass and will contribute significantly to the background for the SF signature events with the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) around 120 GeV.

Only rejecting events with the invariant mass of the lepton system around Z-peak (and also with very small \(m_{\ell\ell}\)) and increasing significantly threshold on the missing transverse energy allows to suppress this background much below the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) one. One should be however well aware that the suppression capability of the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) selection will be very sensitive to the averaged detector effects. It might turn out to be much less performant with the real data.

In Fig. 3 we show distributions, for \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) background events and some kinematical variables used for events selection: \(\Delta\phi_{\ell,\ell}\), \(p_{T}^{miss}\), \(\cos(\Delta\phi_{\ell,\ell})\) and \(m_{\ell,\ell}\). One can notice that for the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) background, the invariant mass of the visible decay products is well localised and far from the Z-peak. In contrast with invariant mass of the \(\tau\)-system, the invariant mass of the \(\ell\ell\) system can be quite precisely reconstructed. This can be efficiently explored for suppression of the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) events.

### Mass reconstruction for signal events

The expected mass resolution of the \(\tau\tau\) system is a second important ingredient to the total cumulative acceptance. From several previous studies [5, 1], it is rather obvious that the resolution of the reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) distribution and the level of tails outside the fixed mass window depends on the average transverse momenta of the Higgs boson at production (so correctness of the assumption that \(\tau\)-decay products are parallel) and on the quality of the reconstruction of \(E_{T}^{miss}\). A quantitative discussion on the impact of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction can be found in Appendix B. It was shown in [17] that the resolution of the reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) is proportional to \(\sigma E_{Tmiss}/sin(\Delta\phi_{ll})\), where \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) is the angular separation in the transverse plane between visible products of \(\tau\) decays. The average \(sin(\Delta\phi_{ll})\) is closer to zero for lower average \(p_{T}^{Higgs}\), see first line of plots in Fig. 2

Table 4 gives Gaussian resolution and acceptance in the fixed mass window after con

In brackets shown is acceptance within mass window of \(m_{H}\pm 20\) GeV._secutive selection. Almost 50% worse resolution could be expected for the topology of the \(gg\to b\overline{b}H\) production and 20% for the topology of the \(gg\to H\) production with respected to the topology of the VBF production. One should therefore be careful when discussing theoretical uncertainties of the expected signal observability. The systematic error of the theoretical predictions on the topology of production process might be the dominant source of the theoretical error.

From Table 4 is is also obvious that \(R_{\ell\ell}<2.8\) selection is not improving resolution any further, while the \(p_{T}^{miss}>30\) GeV and \(cos(\Delta\,\phi_{\ell\ell})>-0.9\) are both helpful to improve mass resolution. The resolution can be still reduced by increasing further threshold on the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) and by rejecting upper tails in the \(m_{\ell\ell}\) distributions. But the improvement from increasing threshold on \(p_{T}^{miss}\) comes with the price of reducing signal acceptance rather strongly. The kinematics of the \(gg\to b\overline{b}H\) production remains the less favourable one for the expected mass resolution.

Fig 4 shows the final shape of the reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) mass for different production mechanisms of the Higgs boson. We should notice that the fitted peak position is not calibrated well at the nominal generated mass value. As the precision of the lepton energy reconstruction is much better than 1%, this is mostly the effect of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction. We quantify it further in the Appendix B of the paper.

### Mass reconstruction for background events

The signal events at 120 GeV will have to be detected above the steeply falling resonant background. For the irreducible \(q\bar{q}\to Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) background respective distribution of the reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) invariant mass is shown in Fig. 5 (left plot).

The ratio of the generated to reconstructed mass for accepted events, as a function of the generated \(\tau\tau\) pair mass is shown (right plot) in Fig. 5. For the _basic selection_ the background shape will not reproduce the original line shape of the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) (the ratio is not flat in the range \(m_{\tau\tau}=100-140\) GeV) and the ratio is of few. Just at 120 GeV background is dominated by events generated with on-shell Z-boson, and misreconstructed at higher masses. This is also the case after additional selection.

Given this behaviour, one of the important experimental issue will be therefore to evaluate procedure to predict/control precisely the expected background shape. It will be dominated, for individual background events, by the tails contribution in mass reconstruction of the on-shell Z-boson.

### Expected number of signal and background events

The cumulative acceptance in the mass window \(m_{H}\pm\) 20 GeV (including selection efficiencies) is presented in Table 5. After _basic+additional_ selection, for signal reconstruction inside mass window, almost factor 10 difference in the cumulative acceptance is estimated between \(b\bar{b}H\) and \(qqH\) processes, factor 3 between \(gg\to H\) and \(qqH\) processes.

In decreasing order come ratios after consecutive selection._

Table 5: _The cumulative acceptance in the mass window \(m_{H}\pm\) 20 GeV, for different production mechanisms._Finally we present expected number of signal and background events for different production mechanism and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) resonant background only3. Please note that only inclusive reconstruction of signal was considered for the selection criteria. Table 6 shows results for NSF leptons (not-same-flavour) and Table 7 for SF leptons. Numbers are given after adding together both lepton flavours and averaging for the different detector performance in reconstruction of electrons or muons.

Footnote 3: Please note that numbers are indicative only, because we have used the lowest order predictions from PYTHIA.

The final contributions from \(gg\to H\) and \(qqH\) processes are comparable (factor four difference was present at the production cross-section). The contribution from \(b\overline{b}H\) is much lower, as expected given assumed value of the production cross-section.

It is rather obvious that without further optimisation of the selection to the topological properties of the production mechanism (jets with large rapidity gap for \(qqH\) production, or identification of b-jets for \(b\overline{b}H\) production) signal observability over irreducible resonant background would not be possible. In the MSSM, one will also profit from enhancement of the \(b\overline{b}H\) coupling. More details on such dedicated selection can be found in [1, 6]. One should be well aware that such further dedicated selection will have also impact on the resolution and level of tails in the reconstruction of the invariant mass of the \(\tau\tau\) system.

## 5 Different Monte Carlo approaches for Yukawa induced \(b\overline{b}\to H\) production process

As already discussed in Section 1, there are very interesting theoretical issues related to predicting total cross-section and modeling events topologies for generating Yukawa induced \(b\overline{b}\to H\) production process. Let's just concentrate on event topologies only and present status of the Monte Carlo generators. At the hard scattering we may consider just (\(2\to 1\)) process of the \(b\overline{b}\to H\) annihilation, with b-quarks from the structure functions. Second approach would be to consider (\(2\to 2\)) process, \(gb\to bH\) scattering, also relaying on the structure functions for b-quarks. The third one is to consider (\(2\to 3\)) processes, the \(gg,q\bar{q}\to b\overline{b}H\), with no b-quarks structure functions involved. If the \(b\overline{b}\to H\) is considered as lowest order matrix element, second and third hard process contribute to the NLO and NNLO terms respectively. With neither of the existing Monte Carlo generators we can predict correctly mixture of all above topologies, generated according to the complete NNLO predictions. It will be mandatory to have available such Monte Carlo sample, as the complete experimental analysis, which is foreseen for signal observation in the MSSM scenario, requires identification of one relatively soft b-jet, or vetoing the b-jet. More discussion on the theoretical issues related to different approaches can be found in [8, 9, 10, 11, 12].

In Table 8 we list the cross-section as obtained from PYTHIA 6.2 simulation according to default initialisation. No attempt was made to change definition of the renormalisation scale, \(Q^{2}\) scale of the hard process or the definition of the b-quark mass. So the normalisation of the cross-section could be used for illustrative purpose only. We will not pursue further the subject of cross-section normalisation, but concentrate on issues related to the signal reconstruction only.

Fig. 6 shows the transverse momenta distribution of the Higgs boson as generated with different hard processes. The average \(<p_{T}^{Higgs}>\) distribution for \(b\overline{b}\to H\) production is of 23 GeV, for the \(gb\to bH\) production is 31 GeV and for the \(gg\to b\overline{b}H\) production is of 28 GeV.

In Table 9 we compare acceptances for signal events generated with different processes. We follow the same pattern of the selection criteria as discussed in Section 4. Although the differences in the average \(<p_{T}^{Higgs}>\) might not look too sizable, the cumulative effect on the acceptances, after selection \(R_{\ell\ell}\), is of factor two between events generated with \(b\overline{b}\to H\) and \(b\overline{b}H\) hard processes.

This Table indicates, that with analyses as designed presently, the large systematic theoretical uncertainty should be assumed for the efficiency of the selection and reconstruction. This is a consequence of the lack of definitive theoretical predictions for modeling the topology of the production process. For the (SF) case and additional selection the effect is even stronger.

In Fig. 7 we show distributions of the kinematical variables used during events selection: \(|sin(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell})\), \(p_{T}^{miss}\), \(cos(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell})\) and \(m_{\ell\ell}\). One can observe some differences in the shape of the \(cos(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell})\) and \(p_{T}^{miss}\) distributions. The cumulated effect on the acceptance after additional selection is like factor 3 after \(R_{\ell\ell}\) selection (see Table 9).

In Table 10 we compare Gaussian resolutions and acceptances inside mass window of \(m_{H}\pm\) 20 GeV for different production processes. Obtained resolutions are moderately different, eg. by 20% between \(b\overline{b}\to H\) and \(gb\to bH\) topologies. But it will still enhance the differences in total acceptances, already introduced by the differences in the selection efficiencies.

## 6 The \(\ell\)_had \(E_{T}^{miss}\)_final state

For the signal production we consider the same three production mechanisms, as discussed in Section 3. Table 12 gives cross-section for signal and resonant background, including branching ratios respective for the lepton-hadron mode.

The same observations, as discussed in Section 3, for the average transverse Higgs boson momenta are obviously valid in case of lepton-hadron mode as well. In the lepton-hadron channel on average there is more visible energy from the \(\tau\)-lepton decays. Just only the \(\nu_{\tau}\) is emitted in case of hadronic decay, while \(\nu_{\tau}\)\(\nu_{\ell}\) are emitted in case of the leptonic one. It is illustrated in Fig. 8 for the \(gg\to H\) production process. The average transverse momenta of the hadron component of \(\tau\)-decay is 20.3 GeV, while the average transverse momenta of the lepton component of the decay of another \(\tau\), is 16.6 GeV.

The SM Higgs boson of the mass of 120 GeV was generated. For the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) process, cross section is given after preselection on the centre-of-mass energy of the hard process, \(\sqrt{(}\hat{s})\), as specified in the Table_.

### Selection criteria

For the lepton-hadron signature we will discuss only irreducible resonant \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) background.

The so called _basic selection_ criteria, following [1], consists of requiring:

* 1 isolated lepton with \(p_{T}^{\ell}>20\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(\eta^{\ell}<2.5\)
* 1 reconstructed jet with \(p_{T}^{jet}>30\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(\eta^{\ell}<2.5\), identified as \(\tau\)-jet
* Threshold on the minimal angular separation between lepton and \(\tau\)-jet, \(|sin(\Delta\phi_{\ell\tau-jet})|>0.2\)
* Threshold on the maximal missing transverse mass, calculated from lepton and missing transverse energy \(m_{T}^{\ell,miss}=\sqrt{2\cdot p_{T}^{\ell}\cdot p_{T}^{miss}\cdot(1-cos( \Delta\phi_{\ell,p_{T}^{miss}}))}\) (this selection is efficient against reducible W+jet background)
* Resolved neutrinos from the linear equation system.

The additional selections are similar as in the lepton-lepton analysis, just for the consistent comparison of performances in different final states. The complete list of selections and acceptances is given in Table 13. Also the same procedure is used for the reconstruction of the invariant mass of the \(\tau\)-pair, \(m_{\tau\tau}\) (just second lepton is replaced by the \(\tau\)-jet).

Figure 8: _The transverse momenta distribution of the lepton from the leptonic \(\tau\) decay (left) and of the \(\rho\) hadron from the hadronic \(\tau\) decay for the \(gg\to H\) production. Distributions normalised to total \(\sigma\times BR\) [pb]._Figure 9: _The characteristic kinematical distributions before respective selection, for different production processes: gg \(\to H\) (left column), gg \(,q\overline{q}\to b\overline{b}H\) (middle column) and \(q\overline{q}\to q\overline{q}H\) (right column). The shaded (yellow) area will be accepted by the respective selection. Distributions normalised to total \(\sigma\times BR\) [pb]._

### Signal and background reconstruction

Table 13 gives cumulated acceptances for the selection described above. After _basic_ selection (following what proposed in [4]), acceptance for the VBF produced Higgs boson is more than three times higher than for the direct production. Just kinematics of those events is more favourable with the average transverse momenta of the Higgs boson being much higher in this case.

The less favourable for the reconstruction is kinematics of the associated production, resulting in the lowest acceptance of all production mechanisms discussed in Table 13. The similar behaviour is observed after adding an _additional_ selection. The difference between acceptances for \(b\overline{b}H\) and \(qqH\) processes are by factor 10. The similar tendency was observed also in the lepton-lepton mode.

The distributions of the kinematical variables for signal and resonant background are shown in Figs. 9 and 10 respectively. Presented choice of variables is the following one:

Figure 10: _The characteristic kinematical distributions before selection for the \(q\overline{q}\to Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) events before respective selection. The shaded (yellow) area will be accepted by the respective selection. Distributions normalised to total \(\sigma\times BR\) [pb]._\(sin(\Delta\phi_{\ell,\tau-jet})\), \(m_{T}^{\ell,miss}\), \(cos(\Delta\phi_{\ell,\tau-jet})\) and \(m_{\ell,\tau-jet}\). One can clearly observe different angular correlations between visible decay products, related to the average transverse momenta of the Higgs system for a given production mechanism. This is the most outstanding favourable effect for acceptance in the of VBF production. The second noticeable effect (see Table 13) is the higher acceptance for resolving neutrino system for the \(gg\to H\) production with respect to the associated production \(gg\to b\overline{b}H\).

### Mass reconstruction for signal and background events

As already pointed out in Section 4.4., the expected mass resolution of the \(\tau\tau\) system is a second important ingredient to the total cumulative acceptance. Table 14 gives Gaussian resolution and acceptance in the fixed mass window after consecutive selection. Almost 30% worse resolution could be expected for the topology of the \(gg\to b\overline{b}H\) production and 10% for the \(gg\to H\) production with respected to the topology of the VBF production. The sensitivity to events topology is a bit weaker than for the lepton-lepton channel. One can notice also that the resolution in the lepton-hadron final state is about 10% better than in the lepton-lepton final state, for the chosen selection criteria. This is due to the fact that the mean value of the transverse momenta of hadronic decay product of the \(\tau\)-lepton is factor two higher than the mean value of the leptonic decay product.

Similarly, like for the lepton-lepton final state, signal events at 120 GeV will have to be detected above the steeply falling background. For the irreducible \(q\bar{q}\to Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) background respective distribution of the reconstructed \(m_{\tau\tau}\) invariant mass is shown in Fig. 12 (left plot). The ratio of the generated to reconstructed mass for accepted events, as a function of the generated \(\tau\) pair mass is shown (right plot) in Fig. 12. Similarly, like for the lepton-lepton channel, the background shape will not reproduce the original line shape of the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) (the ratio is not flat in the range \(m_{\tau\tau}=100-140\) GeV) and background contribution is dominated by on-shell Z-boson events misrecon

The cumulative acceptance in the mass window \(m_{H}\pm\) 20 GeV (including selection efficiencies) is presented in Table 15. After _basic+additional_ selection, for signal reconstruction inside mass window, almost factor 10 difference in the cumulative acceptance is estimated between \(b\overline{b}H\) and \(qqH\) processes and factor 3 between \(gg\to H\) and \(qqH\) processes, for signal reconstruction inside mass window.

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline \hline Selection & \(gg\to H\) & \(bb\overline{H}\) & \(qqH\) \\ \hline \hline Basic selection & \(3.5\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(2.2\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(9.1\cdot 10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \(p_{T}^{miss}>30\) GeV & \(1.7\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(6.4\cdot 10^{-3}\) & \(6.4\cdot 10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \(cos(\Delta\,\phi_{t_{\tau}-jet})>-0.9\) & \(1.6\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(5.7\cdot 10^{-3}\) & \(6.3\cdot 10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \(R_{t_{\tau}-jet}<2.8\) & \(1.6\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(5.6\cdot 10^{-3}\) & \(6.3\cdot 10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 12: _The reconstructed mass of the \(\tau\tau\) system, for the \(q\bar{q}\to Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) events (left plot), normalised to total \(\sigma\times BR\) [pb]. The ratio of the reconstructed to the generated mass for accepted events is shown on the right plot, as a function of the reconstructed mass. In decreasing order come ratios after consecutive selection._Finally, in Table 16, we present expected number of signal (different production mechanism) and background events for different production mechanism and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) background4. Numbers are given after adding together both lepton flavours and averaging over different detector performance in reconstruction of electrons or muons. Numbers presented here also include assumed efficiency for lepton reconstruction and \(\tau\)-jet identification.

Footnote 4: Please note that numbers are indicative only, because we have used the lowest order predictions from PYTHIA.

The expected number of events is respectively higher than in the lepton-lepton case (see Table 6). But similarly, a comparable number of events from gluon fusion and VBF fusion is expected inside mass window. Also comparable is ratio of the expected events from the \(gg\to H\) and \(b\bar{b}H\) production. At this point of the selection also the ratio of eg. \(gg\to H\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) events is like estimated for the lepton-lepton channel. Just, there is no evidence for the lepton-hadron channel being superior over lepton-lepton channel with respect to the size of the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) background.

It is rather obvious, that without further optimisation of the selection to the topological properties of the production mechanism (jets with large rapidity gap for \(qqH\) production, or identification of b-jets for \(b\bar{b}H\) production) signal observability over irreducible resonant background would not be possible. One should be well aware that such further dedicated selection will have also impact on the resolution and level of tails in the reconstruction of the invariant mass of the \(\tau\tau\) system.

## 7 Different Monte Carlo approaches for the Yukawa induced \(b\bar{b}\to H\) production process

As already discussed in Section 1 and 5, the three different approaches can be used for generating Yukawa induced \(b\bar{b}\to H\) production process. Similarly to what presented in Section 5 for the lepton-lepton final state, in this section we would like to concentrate on issues related to the signal reconstruction only and ones again emphasise sensitivity of the final acceptances to the event topologies.

The predicted cross-sections, with different hard processes used, are given in Table 17.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c||c|} \hline \hline Selection & \(gg\to H\) & \(bb\bar{H}\) & \(qqH\) & \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) \\ \hline \hline Basic selection & 200 & 1.54 & 130 & 18 800 \\ \hline \(p_{T}^{miss}>\) 30 GeV & 96 & 0.45 & 90 & 3 400 \\ \hline \(cos(\Delta\,\phi_{t\tau-jet})>-0.9\) & 90 & 0.40 & 88 & 3 100 \\ \hline \(R_{t\tau-jet}<\) 2.8 & 90 & 0.39 & 88 & 3 000 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 16: _Expected number of signal and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) background events, for an integrated luminosity \(10fb^{-1}\) and within the mass window for reconstructed \(\tau\tau\) system, 100-140 GeV. Additional inefficiency of 90% for reconstructed lepton and 50% efficiency for identified \(\tau\)-jet are included._Figure 13: _The characteristic kinematical distributions before respective selection, for hard processes used: \(b\overline{b}\to H\) (left column), \(gb\to bH\) (middle column) and \(q\overline{q}\to b\overline{b}H\) (right column). Distributions normalised to total \(\sigma\times BR\) [pb]._

In Table 18 we compare acceptances for signal events generated with different hard processes. Just creation of the b-quarks could be or not deconvoluted from the structure functions and included in the hard process matrix element. This Table indicates, that large systematic theoretical uncertainty should be assumed for the efficiency of the selection and reconstruction, being a consequence of the modeling of the topology of the production process.

The Gaussian resolution for the reconstructed invariant mass of the \(\tau\tau\) system is specified in Table 19. Similarly, like for the lepton-lepton channel, the best resolution is obtained for the \(g\,b\to b\,H\) hard process, the \(b\bar{b}\to H\), gives almost 20% worse resolution. The sensitivity to the topology is weaker than for the lepton-lepton channel and on average the resolution is better (for a chosen selection criteria). The differences in the mass resolution will enhance the differences already observed for the cumulative acceptances of the selection criteria.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|} \hline \hline Process & \(\sigma\times BR\) \\ \hline \hline \(b\bar{b}\to H\to\tau\tau\to\ell\nu\nu\) _had_\(\nu\) & \(16.7\) [fb] \\ \hline \(g\bar{b}\to b\bar{H}\to\tau\tau\to\ell\nu\nu\) _had_\(\nu\) & \(9.5\) [fb] \\ \hline \(g\,g,q\bar{q}\to b\bar{b}H\to\tau\tau\to\ell\nu\nu\) _had_\(\nu\) & \(3.9\) [fb] \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline \hline Selection & \(b\bar{b}\to H\) & \(g\bar{b}\to b\bar{H}\) & \(b\bar{b}\bar{H}\) \\ \hline \hline Basic selection & & & \\ \hline \hline \(1\) iso \(\ell\), \(p_{T}^{\ell}>20\) GeV & & & \\ \(1\)\(\tau\)-jet, \(p_{T}^{\tau jet}>30\) GeV & \(14.2\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(14.2\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(14.6\cdot 10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \(|sin(\Delta\phi_{\ell\tau-jet})|>0.2\) & \(6.9\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(7.8\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(7.5\cdot 10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \(m_{T}^{\ell,m\,ss}<50\) GeV & \(6.6\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(7.4\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(7.2\cdot 10^{-2}\) \\ \hline resolved neutrinos & \(3.2\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(4.2\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(3.5\cdot 10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \hline Additional selection & & & \\ \hline \hline \(p_{T}^{miss}>30\) GeV & \(5.5\cdot 10^{-3}\) & \(1.4\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(8.7\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \(cos(\Delta\phi_{\ell\tau-jet})>-0.9\) & \(3.5\cdot 10^{-3}\) & \(1.2\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(7.0\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \(R_{\ell\tau-jet}<2.8\) & \(3.3\cdot 10^{-3}\) & \(1.1\cdot 10^{-2}\) & \(6.9\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 18: _The cumulative acceptances of the selection criteria for different approaches of modeling production process._Different estimates for the total cumulative acceptance inside mass window, as presented in Table 20, are clear indication of the size of the systematic uncertainty which should be assigned to the predictions of the expected number of signal events. One should consider it as indication of the size of the theoretical uncertainties related to the lack of definitive prescription for the modeling of the production process.

## 8 Conclusions

In the paper we have discussed one of the key final state signature at LHC, the Higgs boson decaying into \(\tau\)-leptons. It is promising for the light Higgs for the Standard Model and dominates discovery potential in the very wide mass range for the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model scenario.

We have concentrated on the discussion of the reconstruction efficiencies and mass resolution for the different production modes, hence different event topologies.

* We have shown that depending on the production process the cumulative acceptance in the mass window for the signal reconstruction only may differ by factor few (up to factor 10 even). The main effect comes from average transverse momenta of the Higgs boson.

\end{table}
Table 19: _Gaussian resolution for the reconstructed \(\tau\tau\) system for different approaches of modeling production process. In brackets shown acceptance within mass window of \(m_{H}\pm\) 20 GeV._* Discussing in the comparable manner reconstruction in the lepton-lepton and lepton-hadron mode for signal and dominant \(Z/\gamma\to\tau\tau\) background, we don't see any clear evidence that the lepton-hadron one should be superior. This is a strong indication that the lepton-lepton mode should be revisited for the MSSM scenario, where it has been considered as marginal in performed so far studies for ATLAS detector. Of course all background sources have to be carefully evaluated.
* Strong sensitivity on the production topology indicates that for the more complicated production processes, like \(b\overline{b}H\) Yukawa coupling induced mechanism, the possible large theoretical systematic error should be discussed for the predictions. Even if the overall normalisation can be calculated nowadays with NNLO approximation and effects related to the QCD regularisation and renormalisation scale are well understood, its Monte Carlo implementation will be mandatory for the experimental analysis.
* Studies on the reconstruction of the resonant irreducible \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) background clearly shows that the ratio of the reconstructed to generated events in the mass window about Z peak varies by factor few with different selection criteria. Controlling this background for the Higgs masses nor very far from the Z-boson mass will be a challenge at LHC.

Let us just recall, that for the MSSM Higss scenarios in the parameter space corresponding to the A/H/h masses in the range 100-150 GeV, one would have to combine statistically different production modes (\(gg\to H,\,qqH\) and \(b\overline{b}\to H\)), different final states (lepton-lepton and lepton-hadron) and the overlapping mass values (no degeneracy for the h/H/A masses). The key challenge for the theoretical systematic error will be normalisation and modeling of the production mechanism. The key challenge for the experimental analysis will be controlling the contribution from the resonant \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\) process.

Energy calibration for \(\tau\)-jets

The energy calibration for \(\tau\)-jets is realised in a relatively simple way, following method described in [22]. It is based on 1D calibration function which gives the scale function to energy-momentum four-vector of a reconstructed jet. The function is dependent exclusively on the raw transverse momentum of the reconstructed jet. It has been derived by fitting with Gaussian function peak position of the \(p_{T}^{jet}/p_{T}^{\tau-had}\) distribution and taking calibration factor as a value needed to rescale this position to one. Such fit was performed for several bins of the raw transverse momentum of jets, just giving calibration factor as a function of raw \(p_{T}\) of the jet. Such calibration gives very good overall results in the absence of inhomogenity of the detector. This is the case of the fast simulation where several detector effects are absent or averaged.

The scaling function is shown in Fig. 14, where (for comparison) shown are also calibration factors for b-jets and light-jets, as presently implemented in _AtlfastB_[13].

## Appendix B

Figure 14: _The calibration factor as function of raw jet transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{raw}\) for \(\tau-jets\) (derived here) and for b-jets and light-jets (as presently in AtlfastB) (right -plot)._

In Fig. 15 we show the ratio of \(p_{T}^{jet}/p_{T}^{\tau-had}\) as a function of \(p_{T}^{jet}\) (left) and as a function of pseudorapidity (right) for the production mechanisms \(gg\to H\). Both distributions are flat and close to one (the precision from Atlfast reconstruction should not be pushed too far of course). So just very small calibration factor is necessary to bring \(\tau\)-jets back to the energy scale of the hadronic \(\tau\)-decay products.

Figure 15: _For calibrated \(\tau\)-jets the ratio of \(p_{T}^{jet}/p_{T}^{\tau-had}\) as a function of \(p_{T}^{jet}\) (left) and as a function of pseudorapidity (right). Shown are results for gg \(\to H\) events._

Reconstruction of \(E_{T}^{miss}\)

Very important ingredient to the quality of the signal reconstruction will be reconstruction of the total missing energy. In the fast simulation approach [13] this energy is not calibrated with any dedicated procedure, just recalculated from the total energy balance of reconstructed quantities. In Fig. 16 we just show \(E_{T}^{miss}/E_{T}^{\nu}\) for different Higgs production mechanisms. The mean value is relatively well centered around one (only 2% offset), gaussian peaks are symmetric, but the resolution is different for different production mechanisms (topologies), varying on average from 13% for VBF production, to 21% for \(gg\to bbH\) production.

Figure 16: Shown is ratio \(E_{T}^{miss}/E_{T}^{\nu e}\) for different production processes: \(gg\to H\) (top-left), \(b\overline{b}H\) (top-right) and \(qqH\) (bottom) and lepton-hadron channel.

Figs. 17 and 18 show the reconstructed invariant mass of the \(\tau\)-lepton system in the situation, where either true missing energy (left) or reconstructed missing energy (right) is used for calculating \(x_{\tau 1},x_{\tau 2}\) which enter formula for the \(m_{\tau\tau}\) invariant mass. We can notice, that about 30% contribution to the final resolution comes already from the assumption of \(\tau\)-leptons decaying collinearly. The reconstruction of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) itself adds remaining 70% to the total resolution. Comparing reconstruction in the lepton-lepton and lepton-hadron channels one can easily notice that the absolute and relative contribution from the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction is smaller in the lepton-hadron one, thanks to the harder spectrum of hadronic \(\tau\) decays with respect to the lepton ones (see Fig. 8).

Figure 17: _Shown is \(m_{\tau\tau}\) reconstruction for lepton-lepton channel and different production modes: gg \(\to H\) (top), \(b\overline{b}H\) (middle) and qq\(H\) (bottom), if the true neutrino (left) or \(E_{T}^{miss}\) (right) was used for \(m_{\tau\tau}\) reconstruction._

Obviously results shown on the impact of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction are indicative only. These effects should be studied with the full simulation of the detector.
