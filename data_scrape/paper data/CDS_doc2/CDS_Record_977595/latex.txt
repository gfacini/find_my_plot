###### Abstract

_At the LHC, the production of single top events account for a third of the overall top quark production. With a cross-section of about 300 pb, the LHC should lead to a clear evidence of the single top production mechanisms and open a new era of precision measurements in this field. With more than two millions of single top events produced every year during a low luminosity run, a precise determination of all contributions to the total single-top cross-section will be achievable and provide valuable tests of the electro-weak top quark production. These measurements will lead to the first direct measurement of \(\rm V_{tb}\) at the few percent level of precision. They will also constitute a powerful probe for new physics, from the search for evidence of anomalous couplings to the top quark, to the determination of possible additional bosonic contributions to the top quark production._

_We describe in this report some possible strategies to measure all three components of the single top cross-section : the s-channel, the gluon fusion channel and the associated production of a top and a W boson. These mechanisms result in very distinct final states and topologies, and require the development of specific selections. The corresponding analyses are presented and their performance assessed in terms of statistical sensitivity and systematic uncertainties. Those measurements are in most cases dominated by systematic uncertainties and show the need for early strategies devoted to the control of experimental biases, modeling effects and reliable background determinations._

At the LHC, top quarks are mainly produced via the pair production mechanism. With a total cross-section of about 835 pb [1], the LHC will open a new era of precision measurements in top quark physics. Although non-dominant, the single-top production is however far from being negligible with an expected cross-section of about a third of the pair production. Recently the DO collaboration claimed a 3 \(\sigma\) evidence for a purely electro-weak top quark production via the measurement of the combined of s+t channels. Future measurement should benefit from higher statistics and could lead to clearly identify the individual mechanisms responsible for the single-top production. However, with more than two millions of single top events produced every year during a low luminosity run, only the LHC should allow to perform a precise determination of all contributions to the total single-top cross-section. These measurements will constitute the first direct measurement of \(\mathrm{V_{tb}}\) at the few percent level of precision, and constitute a powerful probe for new physics, via the search for evidence of anomalous couplings to the top quark or the measurements of additional contributions from new bosons to the production mechanisms.

The single top production mechanisms proceeds through three different sub-processes resulting in distinct final state topologies and backgrounds. This report revisits the ATLAS potential for the cross-sections measurement of all three contributions that has been established in ATLAS TDR [2] and Ref. [3]. Note that the first sections are included in our previous work [4] and correspond to a common framework for all three analyses. We decide to regroup them in a single report for completeness.

The paper is organized as follows. The single-top phenomenology at the LHC is described in Section 2 together with the main Standard Model (SM) background contributions that affect the single top selection. The relevant variables used to differentiate signal from main backgrounds are discussed in Section 3. We then review the s-channel analysis in Sections 4, the t-channel in Section 5 and the Wt channel in Section 6. Our conclusions are presented in Section 7.

## 2 Single-top phenomenology at the LHC

### Single-top production

In the Standard Model framework, the single-top production is due to three different mechanisms : (a) the W-boson gluon fusion mode, noted Wg, which includes the t-channel contribution (b) the associated production of a top quark and a W-boson, noted \(\mathrm{W+t}\), and (c) the s-channel coming from the exchange of a charged boson \(\mathrm{W^{*}}\). The corresponding diagrams are shown in Fig. 1. We note however that these definitions are valid only at Leading Order (LO) level of corrections: Next To Leading Order (NLO) calculations may indeed lead to the presence of graphs common to those three mechanisms [5]. The total NLO cross-section for all three mechanisms amounts to about 300 pb at the LHC. Among those channels, the dominant contribution comes from the Wg processes, which account for about 250 pb; the \(\mathrm{W+t}\) contribution amounts for about 70 pb while the s-channel \(\mathrm{W^{*}}\) mode is expected with a cross-section of about 10 pb [6][7][8].

In the Standard Model, the top quark almost decays exclusively into a W-boson and a b-quark. In the following, for the s- and t-channels, we use only the leptonic decay of the W's (\(l\nu b\overline{b}\) and \(l\nu b\overline{b}q\) final states, respectively). For the associated production, we consider the two cases where the leptons originates either directly from the W produced together with the top quark, or from the W-boson appearing in the top quark decay (\(qq^{\prime}l\nu b\) and \(l\nu qq^{\prime}b\) final states). The s-channel contribution from leptonic tau decays has been taken into account and is considered among signal events. For the two other contributions, leptonic tau decays were not included in the analysis.

Table 1 reports the cross-sections corresponding to all three mechanisms depending on the charge of the final W-boson. These values are convoluted with the branching ratios associated with the analyzed final states.

We note that in pp collision, the cross-section for single-top processes are not charge symmetrically produced. The s-channel final state cross-section is thus expected to be produced with a factor of 1.6 higher than the final state. This ratio amounts to 1.7 in the t-channel. This feature is of special interest since it generates a charge asymmetry in the leptonic final state that can be exploited in the analysis to reduce the contamination from the top quark pair production, which constitutes the main background to our analyses. On the other hand, the rates for the charge-conjugate processes \(W^{-}+t\) and \(W^{+}+\bar{t}\) are identical.

Significant sources of uncertainties affect the theoretical predictions of the production cross-sections. The channel is known with a precision of 5.0% at NLO, while the Wg channel

has an uncertainty of 3.8%. An uncertainty of 8% is quoted for the \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{t}\) channel. Those uncertainties come from three main sources. The uncertainty in the parton luminosity, depending upon the choice of the parton density functions, is particularly important (2-4% for the \(\mathrm{W}^{*}\) and \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{g}\) channels), since the b parton or the gluons are involved in the hard processes. The choice for the renormalization and factorization (\(\mu\)) scales accounts for about 2-3% uncertainty in \(\mathrm{W}^{*}\) and \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{g}\) calculations. Finally, an uncertainty of \(\pm 4\)\(\mathrm{GeV}/\mathrm{c}^{2}\) in the top mass \(\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{t}}\) results in an overall uncertainty of 1 to 3% in the single-top cross-section calculations, depending on the processes. The error in \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\) plays an insignificant role in the overall uncertainty.

At the time of the present analysis, only LO single-top generators were available for Monte Carlo studies. We use the TopRex [9] generator for the event production and selection efficiency determination, and normalize a posteriori the event yields to the NLO cross-sections. It is obvious that this approach does not account for the possible biases in final state jet (or lepton) kinematics. The use of a NLO generator as MC@NLO [10] appears necessary to validate the selection as it becomes available.

### Standard Model backgrounds

#### 2.2.1 Top pair production

The top pair production constitutes a dominant background to single-top events. The LHC total production cross-section is \(\sigma(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}})=835^{+52}_{-39}\) pb [1], about 3 times larger than the corresponding total single-top cross-section, and more than 80 times that of the \(\mathrm{W}^{*}\) channel.

The main channel affecting the analysis is the "lepton+jets" one (\(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\to\mathrm{l}\nu\mathrm{b}\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j} \mathrm{b}\)), with a final state composed of two b jets, a high \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\) lepton and missing energy. The "di-lepton" channel (\(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\to\mathrm{l}\nu\mathrm{b}\mathrm{l}\nu \mathrm{b}\)) where a lepton is lost in acceptance also constitutes a major background. Finally, top pairs with one or both W decaying into a \(\tau\)-lepton where the \(\tau\) decays into an electron or a muon, may also survive the selection ("tau+jets" \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\to\tau\nu\mathrm{b}\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j} \mathrm{b}\) or "di-tau" \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\to\tau\nu\mathrm{b}\tau\nu\mathrm{b}\) channels). The corresponding cross-sections, convoluted with the branching ratios, are reported in Table 2. Production cross-sections are calculated up to NLO [10].

Even at NLO, the theoretical uncertainty is dominated by the choice of the renormalization scale: a scale variation of \(\mu/2\) to \(2\times\mu\) results in an uncertainty of about 100 pb. Uncertainties due to the choice of the parton density functions, \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\) or \(\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{t}}\) are much smaller and can be neglected

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline Processes & \(\sigma\)\(\times\) BR (fb) \\ \hline \hline \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\to\mathrm{l}\nu\mathrm{b}\mathrm{j}\mathrm{b}\) & 242,420 \\ \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\to\mathrm{l}^{+}\mathrm{l}^{-}\nu\mathrm{p} \mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) & 38,096 \\ \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\nu\mathrm{p}\mathrm{b} \overline{\mathrm{b}}\) & 9,520 \\ \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\to\tau\nu\mathrm{b}\mathrm{j}\mathrm{j} \mathrm{b}\) & 121,210 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: _Cross-sections convoluted with the Branching Ratios (\(l=e,\mu\)) for top pair production used in our analysis._with respect to the latter. As these events constitute our main background, it will therefore be necessary to use cross-section directly from measurements on data to assess properly the contamination of our final sample.

Regarding the Monte Carlo studies carried on \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events, we use the (LO) TopRex generator and apply a scale factor on the production cross-sections. Thus, the same remarks as for single-top mechanisms apply here. Further studies including the comparison of TopRex and the NLO generator MC@NLO [10] have already started [11].

#### 2.2.2 W+jets and Z+jets production

For W+jets and Z+jets production, including Wbb and Zbb, some calculations provide the NLO cross-sections in [12] for specific final states with a leptonic decay for the W-boson. In these calculations, requirements that reproduces typical LHC acceptance and energy thresholds are imposed on leptons and jets composing the final states. For the various W+2jets and Z+2jets final states including single leptonic decay of the W-boson, cross sections, along with the theoretical uncertainty due to scale dependence, are reported in Table 3. The specific requirements applied on the final partons corresponding to these numbers are: \(\mathrm{p_{T}(lepton)}\geq 15\) GeV/c and \(\mathrm{p_{T}(jet)}\geq 20\) GeV/c

W+light jets events constitute a major source of background because of a cross-section several orders of magnitude above the signals. In our case, these processes can mimic the signal if two light jets are wrongly tagged as a b-jet. WQ events where Q stands for b or c quarks, involve the presence of long-lifetime particle jets that are also present in our signal samples. The corresponding cross-section is about the same order of magnitude that for the W\({}^{*}\).

As no event generator including NLO calculations is presently available, we use the (LO) TopRex and HERWIG [13] generators for the WQQ and W + jets event productions, respectively. The corresponding cross-sections were normalized to the NLO values. This method imposes us to reproduce the criteria applied in the phenomenological approach [12], in order to normalize properly our selection efficiencies. The use of more appropriate generators (ALPGEN, AcerMC, MC@NLO) will be needed for future checks.

#### 2.2.3 Di-boson production

Similarly, di-boson events with light jets are a background to our signal due to the presence a high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton as well as b-jets in the final states. The \(\mathrm{WZ}\to 1\nu b\overline{b}\) production cross-sections have been computed at the NLO level for specific final states including a high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton (electron or muon) and is found to be \(\sigma\times\mathrm{BR}=426\) fb [14]. The \(\mathrm{ZZ}\to 1^{-}1^{+}\)\(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) has a cross-section of 340 fb. The WW production, where a light jet is mistagged as a b-jet, has also to be considered. The corresponding cross-section (\(WW\to l\nu jj\)) is 18,500 fb. Samples of di-boson events have been generated using PYTHIA.

#### 2.2.4 QCD background

With a cross-section of about 100 \(\mu\)b the QCD production of \(\mathrm{pp}\to\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) is one the main important backgrounds to our signal because of the presence of two b jets in the final state. Requiring the presence of a high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton and high missing energy tend to decrease the contribution. However, given the difference in the cross-section magnitudes, QCD events with a fake lepton and/or a bad missing energy reconstruction may pass those requirements. To further reduce this contribution, one can require high thresholds on the b jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\), which peaks at low values for this background. Requiring high jet-jet invariant mass and/or high total energy may also help to reduce this background to a manageable level. We use the HERWIG [13] code to generate the QCD sample.

## 3 Discriminant variables in single-top event analyses

The three single-top processes result in quite distinct final states and topologies, leading to the definition of specific analyses in each case. The discrimination beetween them makes use of differences in jet multiplicity, number of required b-tagged jets, as well as angular distributions of leptons and jets present in the final states. Besides, important difference subsist in the level of backgrounds that are faced in the various analyses, leading to the development of tools dedicated to the rejection of specific backgrounds.

We present in this section the basic set of relevant variables that are used to differentiate single-top events from main SM backgrounds. The selection of single-top events is based upon the presence of an isolated high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton and a high transverse missing energy to reject non-W events. Events are required to contain at least two high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) jets, among which exactly one or two have to be identified as coming from the hadronization of a b quark. This set of requirements allows to reduce significantly QCD, and more generally, the jet production contamination. Global and topological variables may also be used to discriminate top pair and W+jets events from our signal. We use in our case the total transverse energy of the events as well as the reconstructed top mass.

### Lepton selection

In the ATLAS detector, the electron acceptance is defined in the pseudo-rapidity range \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\). Beyond that range, the absence of tracking information makes the lepton identification more complex. The electron transverse energy expressed in GeV is determined with a precision of :

\[\sigma(\mathrm{E})/\mathrm{E}=12\%/\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}\oplus 24.5\%/\mathrm{E}_{ \mathrm{T}}\oplus 0.7\%\]

Fig. 2 displays a comparison of the lepton \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) distribution for single-top events and all various backgrounds. Leptons present in the QCD \(\mathrm{p}\mathrm{p}\to\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) samples originate mainly from the semi-leptonic decays of b-hadrons and are thus much softer than those coming from a W-boson decay. Leptons originating from \(\tau\)-decays in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\nu\mathrm{p}\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\to\tau\nu\mathrm{b}\) jjb events also have much lower \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) spectra. All those backgrounds are therefore very sensitive to the lepton \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) threshold used in the analysis. On the upper range of the distribution, W-boson produced leptons tend to be harder in top events than in W+jets events.

The average \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) is about 40 GeV/c for the single top channels, 50 GeV/c for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events (lepton+jets and di-lepton channels) and has to be compared with the mean value of 30 GeV/c for WZ, Wjj and WQ\(\mathrm{\overline{Q}}\) productions. A threshold of 25 GeV/c is set to select a high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton. This value corresponds to the lepton trigger threshold that is used to detect such events, and allows to reduce significantly the contamination from QCD as well as tau decays from top pair events.

The lepton is required to be isolated. The lepton isolation is defined as the distance to the closest jet by \(\Delta\mathrm{R}=\sqrt{\Delta\Phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\). Note that jets are defined by the use of a cone algorithm whose performance are described in Ref [15]. The isolation of a high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton with respect to the closest jet depends upon the topology of events. In a high jet multiplicity environment like \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) and single top events, the \(\Delta\mathrm{R}(\mathrm{lepton,jet})\) value tend to be lower than in a simple W+jets event. A cut at \(\Delta\mathrm{R}(\mathrm{lepton,jet})\geq 0.4\) is set for the selection.

To remove events with two leptons like \(\mathrm{Z}\to\mathrm{l^{+}l^{-}}\) and dileptonic top pairs, a veto is performed in any pairs of leptons with opposite signs and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) above 10 GeV/c. Note that this lepton veto

Figure 2: _Lepton transverse momentum probability density for signal and backgrounds._may introduce some systematic effects due to the mis-identification of the lepton sign as well as a lower lepton identification efficiency at a lower \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) threshold. These effects have to be addressed in a full event reconstruction stage. Note that the sign of the selected lepton provides the nature of the single-top event: a positron or positive muon will sign a t decay, while an electron or negative muon will sign a \(\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) decay.

### Missing energy \(\mathrm{mE_{T}}\)

The transverse missing energy physically originates from the presence of a neutrino in the W-boson decays. It is shown in Fig. 3 for signal and backgrounds.

Significant differences can be seen in the distributions which carry a significant discriminating power. Average values are around 30 GeV for W+jets production and about 55 GeV for single-top productions. The transverse missing energy is higher than 60 GeV for top pair events.

A threshold at 25 GeV is thus applied to select a leptonic W decay. The use of the full spectrum may however help the discrimination against backgrounds with softer \(\mathrm{mE_{T}}\) like WZ, WQQ, and W+jets events, as well as against events with harder \(\mathrm{mE_{T}}\) spectrum like top pairs. A likelihood approach could thus benefit the selection.

This variable is extremely sensitive to the performance of the hadronic and electromagnetic energy measurement of the detector. Angular and energy resolution, the identification capabilities of noisy calorimeter cells, the modeling of the underlying events and the pile-up effects thus appear as key factors in the missing energy measurement. Again, full reconstruction studies are required to assess the magnitude of those effects.

### Light jets

A jet is reconstructed by using an algorithm which groups clusters of energy within a fixed cone, defined with a radius of \(\Delta\mathrm{R}=\sqrt{\Delta\Phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}=0.4\). In ATLFAST [15], jets are defined in the

Figure 3: Transverse missing energy for signal and backgrounds.

\(\eta\) is the energy of pseudo-rapidity range \(|\eta|\leq 5.0\) with a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) above 15 GeV/c. With energy measured in GeV, the jet energy resolution is given by:

\[\sigma(\mathrm{E})/\mathrm{E}=50\%/\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}\oplus 3\%\text{ for }|\eta_{\mathrm{ jet}}|\leq 3\]

\[\sigma(\mathrm{E})/\mathrm{E}=100\%/\sqrt{\mathrm{E}}\oplus 7\%\text{ for }|\eta_{ \mathrm{ jet}}|\geq 3.\]

Distributions for the leading \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) jets is also shown in Fig. 4. Those Figures show that \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events have harder \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) spectra than the other processes, with average values of about 100 GeV/c and 70 GeV/c respectively for the leading and 2nd highest jet energy. Those values are respectively 80 and 50 GeV/c for all three single-top processes. For WQQ and \(\mathrm{W+jets}\) events, the average energies are found at much lower values, around 35-40 GeV/c for the leading jet and 20-30 GeV/c for the second highest jet energy.

The preselection requires at least two jets above a threshold of 25 GeV/c in order to reduce the QCD, W+jets as well as WZ/WW contamination. Again, the use of the full spectrum

Figure 5: Number of jets for signal and backgrounds.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

a 30 GeV/c threshold. This number falls to 11 at 40 GeV/c and 7 at 50 GeV/c. This gives confidence that a 35 GeV/c threshold is relevant for our selection. WQ\(\bar{\mathrm{Q}}\) events also contain softer b-tagged jets (the same holds for c-jets in W+jets sample) than single-top events, as well as b-jets originated from Z decays, with an average \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of 60 GeV/c (resp. below 30 GeV/c ). A high threshold in the highest b-jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) can therefore help reject significantly the QCD and W+jets background. A looser cut may be applied to the 2nd highest b-jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) to further eliminate the remaining WQ\(\bar{\mathrm{Q}}\) events.

The expected number of b-tagged jet in the acceptance is shown in Fig. 8 for signal and all backgrounds. About 90% WQ\(\bar{\mathrm{Q}}\) events have only one b-tagged jet, the other being either out of acceptance or below the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) threshold. No QCD events out of 5,000,000 pass the requirement on two b-tagged jets. The situation is dramatically different in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) and \(\mathrm{W^{*}}\) events which both contain more than 13% events with two b-tagged jets. Requiring more than one b-tagged jet is

Figure 6: _Highest b-jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) for signal and backgrounds._

Figure 7: _2nd highest b-jet transverse momentum for signal and backgrounds._

therefore mandatory to improve the rejection of QCD and W+jets backgrounds. Regarding the two other single-top mechanisms, the number of b-tagged jets is not as high as for the s-channel events. If one indeed expects two b-hadrons in the \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{g}\) channel, the second b-jet is missed in a significant fraction of times because the b parton is produced along the beam pipe, mostly outside the tracking acceptance and with a low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\), as can be seen in Fig. 7. The probability to see a second b-tagged jet in this sample is less than 5%. For \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{t}\) events, no second b is expected, which results in more than 97% events with only one b-tag, the remaining 2nd b-tagged jet coming mostly from charm decay.

The b-jet multiplicity strongly depends upon the b-tagging capabilities of the detector. A high efficiency and a low mistag rate will affect the discrimination against non-top background, making an impact in the analysis sensitivity. Sections 4.5, 5.3 and 6.3 will adress the effects of deviations from the nominal expected performance on the systematic uncertainties affecting the selection efficiencies.

### Total transverse energy \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\)

The total transverse energy of the event is shown to have a significant discriminant power against both top pair and \(\mathrm{W}+\mathrm{jets}\) production. While the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events tend to contain harder jets, the latter are characterized by the presence of softer jets in the final state compared to those for the signal. One usually uses the scalar sum of transverse energy computed over jets as well as leptons and missing energy. Obviously this variable is correlated to the number of jets and therefore careful treatment must be applied. In our selection \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) is defined as:

\[\mathrm{H_{T}}=\Sigma_{\mathrm{jet}}\ \mathrm{E_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}+E_{T}^{ \mathrm{l}}+mE_{T}}.\]

Probability density for this quantity is represented in Fig. 9 for signal and the various backgrounds. The \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) distribution peaks at around 180 GeV/c for WQ\(\mathrm{\bar{Q}}\) events while the average

Figure 8: _Number of b-tagged jets for signal and backgrounds._

value for the W\({}^{*}\) channel is about 230 GeV/c. For tt events in the various channels the distributions peak around 300 GeV/c. A window in H\({}_{\rm T}\) seems therefore to bring a significant rejection power against both WQ\(\rm\bar{Q}\) and tt backgrounds.

### Reconstructed Top mass \(\rm m_{t}\)

With the LHC statistics, one can consider reconstructing a top mass from its decay products in order to reduce further the non-top background contamination of the selected sample. In our case where the W-boson decays leptonically, one faces an ambiguity arising from the determination of the neutrino longitudinal momentum: while the neutrino transverse energy can be inferred from the transverse missing \(\rm E_{T}\), the longitudinal momentum is unknown. It is however possible to obtain the \(\rm p_{z}^{\nu}\) by using the W-mass as a constraint. The longitudinal momentum can thus be written as:

\[\rm p_{z}(\pm\nu)=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}}{2a}\]

where :

\[\rm a=E^{2}(l)-p_{z}^{2}(l)\,\ \rm b=-2\left(\frac{m_{W}^{2}}{2}+p_{T}^{ \rightarrow}(l).p_{T}^{\rightarrow}(\nu)\right).p_{z}(l)\]

and

\[\rm c=E^{2}(l).p_{T}^{2}(\nu)-\left(\frac{m_{W}^{2}}{2}+p_{T}^{ \rightarrow}(l).p_{T}^{\rightarrow}(\nu)\right)^{2}\]

Usually the twofold ambiguity is lifted by chosing the solution that gives the lowest \(\rm p_{z}^{\nu}\). In our case though we choose not to apply this criterium but apply a criterium at a later stage of the selection. One has to notice that this method may have no solution: this corresponds to events where the transverse reconstructed W mass is larger than the W boson mass due to resolution effects. In this case we keep the real part of the solution, following the DO prescription [16].

Figure 9: _Distribution of the energy \(\rm H_{T}\) for signal and backgrounds._

Once the solutions to \(\rm p_{Z}^{\nu}\) are found there are four possible combinations to reconstruct the top quark momentum and mass: two depending on the neutrino solution and two due to the presence of the b-tagged jets. We choose to keep the solution leading to the highest \(\rm p_{T}\) top [17]. Figs. 10 show the probability densities associated to the reconstructed top mass for signal and the various backgrounds.

Single-top s-channel cross-section measurement

The measurement of the s-channel may appear as the most delicate of the three main single-top processes, because of its relatively low cross-section compared to the two others. It is however one of the most interesting because the production of tb final state events is directly sensitive to contributions from extra W bosons or charged Higgs bosons as predicted in two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) of type II [18]. The s-channel selection as well as the interpretation in terms of charged Higgs may be found in a previous work in Ref. [4].

### Preselection

The s-channel analysis is based upon the following criteria: a selected event must have at least one high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton in the central region with a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) above 25 GeV/c and a total transverse missing energy above 25 GeV/c. The event must pass a secondary lepton veto cut, applied to any lepton with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) above 10 GeV/c with a sign opposite to that of the selected high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton. The sign of the high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton is used to determine the "flavour" of the final top and b-quark pair: a positive (negative) charge lepton signs a \(\mathrm{t\overline{b}}\) (\(\mathrm{\overline{b}}\)) final state.

The event must have exactly two or three jets above 15 GeV/c. Among those, two must be above 25 GeV/c. Finally, the events are then required to have, among those two or three selected jets, two b tagged jets with a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) above a threshold of 30 GeV/c. Selected events are thus classified as "2b0j" (2 b-tagged jets and no extra light jet above 15 GeV/c ) or as "2b1j"

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r r} \hline processes & \(\mathrm{t\overline{b}}\) final state & \(\mathrm{t\overline{b}}\) final state \\ \hline \hline s-channel & \(1,200\pm 7\) & \(840\pm 4\) \\ t-channel & \(1,860\pm 35\) & \(1,120\pm 20\) \\ W+t channel & \(\leq\)8 & \(\leq\)5 \\ \hline \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background & & \\ \(\mathrm{t}\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}\nu\mathrm{b}\;\mathrm{jj}\mathrm{b}\) & \(2,220\pm 75\) & \(2,220\pm 75\) \\ \(\mathrm{t}\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}\nu\mathrm{b}\;\mathrm{e}\nu\mathrm{b}\) & \(2,790\pm 40\) & \(2,790\pm 40\) \\ \(\mathrm{t}\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\tau\nu\mathrm{b},\tau\nu\mathrm{b}\) & \(360\pm 28\) & \(360\pm 28\) \\ \(\mathrm{t}\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\tau\nu\mathrm{b},\mathrm{jj}\mathrm{b}\) & \(60\pm 10\) & \(60\pm 10\) \\ \hline Z/W+jets background & & \\ WQQ & \(2,250\pm 50\) & \(1,410\pm 30\) \\ \(\mathrm{Wjj}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}\nu,\mathrm{jj}\) & \(1,710\pm 170\) & \(1,260\pm 120\) \\ \(\mathrm{WZ}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}\nu\mathrm{b}\mathrm{\overline{b}}\) & \(90\pm 10\) & \(60\pm 5\) \\ \(\mathrm{Zb\overline{b}}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}^{+}\mathrm{e}^{-}\mathrm{b \overline{b}}\) & \(7\pm 3\) & \(7\pm 3\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: _Number of pre-selected events in the ”2b0j” sample expected for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). Uncertainties come from Monte Carlo statistics only_events (2 b-tagged jets plus one extra light jet and no 4th jet above 15 GeV/c ).

Note that the requirement of two b-tagged jets is crucial to reduce the contamination of W+jets events that have a cross-section several orders of magnitude that of the signal. To a lesser extent, this is also true for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events since among the 2-jet and 3-jet events, only a few of them have 2 b-tagged jets. Table 4 reports the number of expected events with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). About 1,200 (840) W\({}^{*}\) events are pre-selected in the \(\mathrm{t\overline{b}}\) (\(\mathrm{\overline{t}}\)) final states. The dominant background comes from the top pair production in the dilepton and "lepton+jets" channels, followed by the WQQ contamination. The remaining W+jets contamination is due to the high cross-section for such events, and is expected, at this stage, to be slightly above the signal expectation. The resulting S/B ratio is about 11% (9%) in the \(\mathrm{t\overline{b}}\) (\(\mathrm{\overline{t}}\)) final state. It is obvious that the combination of both final states is required to improve the sensitivity.

For the 2-jet samples, the signal efficiency is slightly above 3.0%. No QCD events are selected out of \(5\times 10^{6}\). Top pair events are selected with an efficiency below 0.1% in the "lepton+jets" channel while tau+jets events are almost negligible. On the contrary "dilepton" (including "ditau") top pair events are selected with a higher efficiency ranging from 0.25 to 0.5%. Overall, this results in an almost equal contamination originating from "lepton+jets" and "dilepton" channels, due to the difference in branching ratios. As expected, the WQ\(\mathrm{\bar{Q}}\) contamination is greatly reduced by a 2-b tag requirement with a 0.2% selection efficiency. At the same time, only 1.2% WW and WZ diboson events are selected. \(\mathrm{W+jets}\) events are removed because of the presence of non-b softer jets, with a final yield depending upon the mistag rate, for which we take to be equal to 1% in the present analysis. Regarding the three-jet samples, the signal efficiency is about 1.9%. While the double tag requirement keeps the \(\mathrm{W+jets}\) contamination relatively low, the signal is swamped in the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background with a much lower S/B below 1%.

Results have been interpreted as a function of the integrated luminosity. In 2-jet events, a 5 \(\sigma\) discovery requires about 5 fb\({}^{-1}\). The use of the 3-jet samples does not bring any significant improvement since at least 60 fb\({}^{-1}\)are needed to reach the same yields. The statistical sensitivity to the cross-section measurements has also been evaluated from the ratio \(\sqrt{\mathrm{S+B}}/\mathrm{S}\) which provides the sensitivity of the signal to signal and background statistical fluctuations. A statistical sensitivity of 7% can be achieved by combining both \(\mathrm{t\overline{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{\overline{t}}\)b final state analyses with an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). To improve the S/B ratio and reduce further the systematic uncertainties associated to the background estimates, we can choose to apply further requirements on topological variables. Fig. 12 displays the distribution of the total transverse energy of the events while Fig. 12 shows the reconstructed (leptonic) top mass after the preselection.

### HT window optimization

After the pre-selection, the remaining sample is characterized by a low ratio signal over background of about 10% with dominant backgrounds originating from the top pair and WQQ production. In order to purify the sample, we apply further requirements based on the total transverse energy \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) measured in the event and on the top mass reconstructed from the b jet and the leptonic decay products of the W boson.

In order to optimize the upper and lower bounds applied on \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\), one can use three estimators: the ratio S/B, which reflects the sample purity as a function the threshold values; the statistical significance S/\(\sqrt{\mathrm{B}}\); and the sensitivity defined as \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B+\sigma_{B}}}\), which includes the systematic uncertainty in background estimate, set at \(\sigma_{\rm B}=12\%\times{\rm B}\). Figs. 14 and Fig. 14 show the sensitivity as function of the \({\rm H_{T}}\) energy cut for both the lower and upper bounds.

The optimal choice for the window results from a compromise between a minimal loss in statistical sensitivity and a maximal improvement in the purity: the lower threshold is set at 170 GeV/c while the upper bound is set at 300 GeV/c. The signal efficiency is decreased by about 40% for the signal. The corresponding loss is about 50% for \({\rm t\overline{t}}\) events and above 70% for \({\rm WQ\overline{Q}}\) and \({\rm W+jets}\) events, resulting in a slight S/B ratio increase.

### Top mass window optimization

The optimization of the lowest and upper bounds has been performed in the same way as for the \({\rm H_{T}}\) quantity. Fig. 16 and Fig. 16 show the sensitivity as function of the \({\rm M(l\nu b)}\) cut respectively for the lower and the upper bounds. The choice of a reconstructed mass in the \([120,200]\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) range increases the ratio S/B by 40% to about 14% at the loss of half the acceptance in signal efficiency. We also estimate the top purity in our sample by using the MC truth information and comparing the true top momentum \({\rm p_{T}^{true}}\) and phi \(\Phi_{\rm top}^{\rm true}\) with the corresponding reconstructed values \({\rm p_{T}^{rec}}\) and \(\Phi_{\rm top}^{\rm rec}\). For a match defined by the two requirements \(|{\rm p_{T}^{rec}}-{\rm p_{T}^{true}}|\leq 20\) GeV/c and \(|\Phi^{\rm rec}-\Phi^{\rm true}|\leq 0.4\) an overall purity above 60% is measured using the highest top \({\rm p_{T}}\) criterium. Further studies on this topics are still on going in order to optimize the performance.

### Selection efficiency and background rejection

Table 5 reports the number of selected events after the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) and the top mass cuts. The signal efficiency is reduced by 2/3 after both criteria have been applied. At the same time, non-top backgrounds are reduced by 80%. In the top pair background, the contamination from "dilepton" events is decreased by 90% while the "lepton+jet" is decreased by 70%. Note that no significant \(\mathrm{W+t}\) events survive the topological selection.

For the \(\mathrm{t\overline{b}}\) final state, about 385 signal events survive with 2,760 background events, resulting in an improved S/B ratio of S/B = 13.9%. For the \(\mathrm{\overline{b}}\) final state, 275 signal events are remaining for a total background of 2,242, resulting in a S/B ratio of 12.3%. In both cases, the main background is due to the "lepton+jets" top pair production (about 30% of the total), followed by the Wg single-top (27%). Heavy flavour \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{Q}\mathrm{\overline{Q}}\) events now constitute less than 20% of the remaining background, which is about the same order than \(\mathrm{W+jets}\) events. Other top pair backgrounds (including tau decays) and WZ production appear at a negligible level.

### Systematic uncertainties

Three main sources of systematic uncertainties are considered: the systematics coming from the experimental biases that affect the selection efficiency of both signal and background's events; the uncertainty specific to the methods used to estimate the background's contamination; and the systematics due to the determination of the integrated luminosity \(\mathcal{L}\), assumed to be 5% in what follows.

#### 4.5.1 Experimental systematic uncertainty

Common experimental systematics originate from three main sources: the determination of the jet energy scale, the imperfect knowledge of the b-tagging efficiency and mistag rates, and themodeling of initial and final state gluon radiations (ISR and FSR).

#### 4.5.1.1 Jet energy scale

An uncertainty in the jet energy scale affects all jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) distributions, which results in a bias in the jet selection efficiency. This also has a significant impact on the jet veto performance, the determination of the missing energy as well as in the performance of the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) and \(\mathrm{M(l\nu b)}\) criteria that are used in the topological selection.

In order to quantify such effect, the energy of each jet has been shifted up and down in the Monte Carlo by a value corresponding to the jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) uncertainty, and half of the difference in the selection efficiency was taken as a systematic uncertainty. Table 6 reports the variation seen as we vary the jet energy scale. A variation of 3.1% is measured in the signal efficiency \(\mathrm{\epsilon_{W*}}\), resulting in a relative error of \(\pm\)1.6% due to the uncertainty of the jet energy scale. For the background processes, this effect is shown to have a poor impact on the top pair production. On the other hand, the rejection of W+jets events, which contain softer jets, depends significantly from the knowledge of the jet energy scale. A total background variation of 6.8% is measured, thus resulting in a systematic uncertainty of 3.4%.

The magnitude of systematic effects depend on the set of selection cuts and hence may vary with the stage of the selection that is considered. Systematics are slightly higher at the preselection stage and after the application of the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) requirement only: the effect on signal events is 5.9% after the preselection and 4.9% at the latter stage. For backgrounds, those numbers range between 5.4% and 4.5%, significantly higher than after the full selection.

#### 4.5.1.2 b-tagging efficiency

Another source of systematics comes from the imperfect knowledge of the b-tagging efficiency and mistag rates. As can be inferred from the selection described in Section 3 b-tagging

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c c} \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Number of events in 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)} \\ processes & No scaling & \(\mathrm{E_{jet}}+\sigma_{\mathrm{jet}}\) & \(\mathrm{E_{jet}}-\sigma_{\mathrm{jet}}\) \\ \hline \hline Wg channel & 22.2 & 24.1 & 20.4 \\ \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) ”lepton+jets” & 25.1 & 22.8 & 24.8 \\ \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) dilepton & 13.1 & 12.7 & 13.4 \\ \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) ditau,tau+jets & 4.2 & 4.5 & 4.2 \\ \(\mathrm{WQ\overline{Q}}\) & 15.4 & 15.5 & 12.9 \\ Wjj & 11.7 & 11.7 & 9.8 \\ \hline Total Background & 91.7 & 91.3 & 85.5 \\ Signal & 12.8 & 13.0 & 12.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: _Number of selected events after the application of the full topological selection with the effect of a jet energy scale change._performance is crucial for background rejection. A variation of b-tagging efficiency thus directly results in a variation of the relative contribution of each sample.

Fig. 18 and Fig.18 report the variation of the selection efficiency for b-tagging efficiencies taken in the range 55% to 65%. For signal events a 2.6% change in the selection efficiency is seen for a 1% variation of the b-tagging efficiency. This change is similar for most backgrounds, with a variation of 2.7% for the summed backgrounds. This results in a relatively stable S/B ratio over the full range of variation of \(\epsilon_{\mathrm{b}}\), as shown in our previous study [4].

This observation results in a reduced dependence of the cross-section measurement to the exact determination of the b-tagging efficiency. In our case, a 5% variation in the b-tagging efficiency will result in a 13.5% change in the number of selected signal and background events. It is obvious that, the S/B ratio being stable, this number does not reflect the uncertainty in the cross-section. We however conservatively quote half of this number as our systematics associated to the cross-section measurement, ie: 7.0% (including the MC statistics).

The uncertainty on the mistag rate impacts mainly the rejection of W+jets events : in our case a 5% mistag rate results in a 10% variation of the W+jets events. This translates to an uncertainty of 3.5% in the total background estimate. The total uncertainty quoted is thus 8.0%. This number however makes of the b-tagging and mistag rate knowledge one of our main source of errors, which is expected from a double-tag based analysis.
Another source of uncertainty is the modeling of initial and final gluon radiations. ISR dramatically affects the jet multiplicity of the event, while uncertainty in the FSR modeling affects the determination of the jet energy scale, which may result in a change of the selection efficiency.

This is illustrated by Fig. 19 which shows the jet multiplicity for signal and background events with ISR and FSR alternatively switched ON and OFF. For b-jets the effects are particularly significant in the \(\mathrm{WQ}\bar{\mathrm{Q}}\) selection, as seen in Fig. 20. We quantified this effect by switching ON and OFF the ISR and the FSR separately, and by considering 10% of the observed shift in the selection efficiency as a systematic error. This value constitutes a conservative approach and corresponds to the expected precision on the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{\mathrm{s}}\) determination at the LHC [19].

Table 7 reports the number of events after the full topological selection with the ISR and FSR alternatively switched ON and OFF for signal and background. For the signal events selection, a relative variation of 4.9% is seen for the ISR alone while an effect of 6.3% is observed for the FSR. We thus quote an error of 7.7% as the quadratic sum of both effects.

Backgrounds are differently affected by the ISR/FSR modeling. Top pair contributions are increased as the ISR is switched OFF because of the increased population of 2-jet events. On the other hand, as the FSR is switched OFF, most of those processes are significantly more reduced than for signal events. \(\mathrm{WQ}\bar{\mathrm{Q}}\) events selection is particularly sensitive to FSR modeling: switching OFF the FSR tends to increase the jet energies which results in an increased jet selection efficiency. In this particular case, variations that may reach 20% are oberved in the \(\mathrm{WQ}\bar{\mathrm{Q}}\) selection efficiency. The total effect on the sum of all backgrounds is estimated as the quadratic sum of both ISR and FSR effects. An uncertainty of 7.3% is estimated for the total background.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c c} \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Number of events in 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)} \\ processes & ISR/FSR on & No ISR & No FSR \\ \hline \hline \(\mathrm{Wg}\) channel & 22.2 & 27.9 & 32.8 \\ \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) "lepton+jets" & 25.1 & 51.2 & 15.2 \\ \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) dilepton & 13.1 & 27.0 & 16.7 \\ \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) ditau+jets & 4.2 & 8.3 & 3.0 \\ \(\mathrm{WQ}\bar{\mathrm{Q}}\) & 15.4 & 19.5 & 34.6 \\ \(\mathrm{Wjj}\) & 11.7 & 15.0 & 26.0 \\ \hline Total Background & 91.7 & 148.9 & 128.3 \\ Signal & 12.8 & 19.1 & 20.8 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 20: Impact of ISR and FSR on jet multiplicity for s- and Wg single-top channels and for top pair and WQQ productions(right).

Systematic effects appear to affect even more the efficiency at the earlier stages of the selection. For signal, the effect associated to the ISR/FSR modeling is 8.7% after the pre-selection and slightly reduced to 8% with the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) requirement. For background, significant differences are seen in top pair and W+jets productions, as expected from Fig. 19 and Fig. 20. An uncertainty of 11.8% is quoted at the pre-selection stage and is reduced down to 9.1% as the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) window is applied. The use of the topological selection thus helps reducing the magnitude of these effects by cutting off events in distribution tails.

#### 4.5.1.4 Total experimental systematics

The total systematic uncertainty affecting the selection is obtained as the quadratic sum of all effects mentionned previously. A total experimental error of \(\delta\epsilon_{\mathrm{W}*}/\epsilon_{\mathrm{W}*}=12.5\%\) (systematic) is obtained, dominated by the b-tagging efficiency and mistag rates uncertainties amd by the modelling of the ISR/FSR. This level of the systematic uncertainty is thus about the same order of the statistical sensitivity. Table 8 reports the relative systematic uncertainties affecting the selection at different stages of the analysis.

#### 4.5.2 Systematic uncertainty on background estimates

All of the background estimates rely upon Monte Carlo that are used to compute the selection efficiencies. Those generators employ LO matrix element for the hard parton scattering followed by parton showering to simulate radiation and fragmentation. We use in our cases PYTHIA v6.2, TopRex v4.1 and HERWIG v6.4 for the event generation, and normalized the event yields to the NLO cross-section, as mentionned in Section 2.2. However, even at NLO the theoretical sources of uncertainty are significant. As a consequence, direct measurements from data itself will be required.

The sources of theoretical uncertainties come from the choice of the renomalization and factorization scales, the choice of the parton distribution functions and the uncertainty in the input parameters such as the top mass and the b-fragmentation function.

Table 9 reports the magnitude of those effects when available. The single-top cross-section is expected to decrease with the top mass value: a 4 GeV uncertainty results in an 9% uncertainty in the \(\mathrm{W}^{*}\) cross-section and 5% in the \(\mathrm{W}g\) channel. The knowledge of the PDF (b- and gluon

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c}  & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Sources of experimental systematics} & Statistics \\  & jet E scale & b-tagging & ISR/FSR & Total & \\ \hline Pre-selection & 5.9\% & 8.7\% & 8.7\% & 13.6\% & 7\% \\ \hline HT-requirement & 4.9\% & 8.2\% & 8.0\% & 12.5\% & 9\% \\ M(lvb)-requirement & 4.6\% & 8.0\% & 7.7\% & 12.0\% & 12\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: _Experimental systematic uncertainties at different stages of the selection_.

PDF for \(\mathrm{Wg}\) ) contributes significately to the errors. Regarding the top pair production, the cross-section including the NLO+NLL corrections is quoted with an uncertainty of 12% [20]. This number results of a contribution from the scale uncertainty (about \(\pm\) 6%) and from the PDF where the level is at 10% (MRST vs CTEQ5M) for \(\mathrm{m_{t}}=175\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\). The difference between the two sets is about 3% but is highly sensitive to the input value used for \(\mathrm{\alpha_{s}(M_{Z})}\)[20].

Regarding the \(\mathrm{Wbb}\) (\(\mathrm{e\nu bb+X}\)) production, recent computations with MCFM [12] lead to an uncertainty of 20% in the NLO cross-sections, this result being obtained with the use of a LHC-like selection applied on the final lepton and jets. Regarding \(\mathrm{W+jet}\) backgrounds, a conservative approach has been chosen and an uncertainty of 20% is quoted as well. Summing all background contributions (in the fraction of selected events) result in a total theoretical error of 11%.

Note that the input top mass also has an impact in the selection efficiencies determination, the jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) distributions depending upon the mass of the decaying particle. For a higher top mass value, jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) distributions are shifted towards higher values, leading to a better pre-selection efficiency for all top events production: an effect of about 2% is seen in the selection efficiency of \(\mathrm{W^{*}}\) and \(\mathrm{W+t}\) channels as one goes from 175 to 180 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\). This has been investigated in [4] and is considered as negligible in regards to the other sources of error.

### Summary

The precision on the cross-section has been assessed for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\)at different stages of the analysis. After the simple preselection stage, results show a good statistical sensitivity but higher level of systematic uncertainties:

\[\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma}=7\%_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm 13.8\%_{\mathrm{exp}} \pm 11\%_{\mathrm{bckgd\ theo}}\pm 5\%_{\mathrm{lumi}}\]

Using both the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) and reconstructed top mass results in a significantly reduced level of systematics at the price of a loss in statistical sensitivity:

\[\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma}=12\%_{\mathrm{stat}}\pm 12\%_{\mathrm{exp}} \pm 11\%_{\mathrm{bckgd\ theo}}\pm 5\%_{\mathrm{lumi}}\]

The statistical sensitivities obtained with the \(H_{T}\) requirement alone and after the topological selection are shown, as a function of the integrated luminosity, in Figs. 21 and 22, respectively. In all selection cases, systematic errors are expected to dominate the cross-section determination.

Table 9: _Theoretical systematic uncertainties used in the analysis for signal and the main backgrounds. CTEQ5M1 was used [6] to compute those numbers._Experimental effects are dominated by the knowledge of the b-tag and mistag rates, since the double-tag constitutes a central point in the selection. The other significant effect comes from the knowledge of the ISR/FSR modeling effects because of the importance of the jet multiplicity requirement in the selection. It is obvious that the error associated to the ISR/FSR modeling is an overestimation, and that this uncertainty will be constrained by comparison of Drell-Yann data and the event generators. B-tagging should also benefit from the use of a huge b-enriched control sample. Finally, theoretical uncertainties are of the same order of magnitude of the statistical errors. They should be reducible if we are able to estimate the background contamination directly from the data.

Single-top t-channel cross-section measurement

The measurement of the t-channel cross-section benefits from a significantly higher statistics compared to the s-channel analysis. The final topology is also significantly different of that of the s-channel, and leads to a specific selection.

### Preselection

We select t-channel events in the channel where the W boson decays leptonically into an electron or a muon. This leads to requirements based on the presence of a high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton and high missing transverse energy. To remove events with two leptons like those coming from \(\mathrm{Z}\to 1^{+}1^{-}\) and dileptonic top pairs, a veto is performed in any pairs of leptons with opposite signs and above 10 GeV/c, just as in the s-channel analysis.

The situation is distint from the latter analysis in the domain of reconstructed jets. More than 60% of t-channel events have two or three jets. Among those jets, one points towards the forward region, beyond the pseudo-rapidity range \(|\eta_{\mathrm{jet}}|\geq 2.5\). This is a distinct feature which is used to discriminate from the other top quark production sources, as shown in Fig. 23. This forward jet must also pass a high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) threshold in order to reduce the contamination from W+jets, WQQ and QCD, WZ and QCD events. Fig. 24 displays the momentum of the selected forward jet in 2 jet final state events.

Among the two or three jets, at least one jet must be b tagged in the central pseudo-rapidity region. The other b jet present in the final state is usually emitted towards the very forward region, outside the tracker acceptance and thus out of reach of the b-tagging algorithm in most cases.

The pre-selection requires the presence of an isolated high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lepton above 25 GeV/c, missing transverse energy above 25 GeV/c and makes use of a secondary lepton veto. At least one jet must be b tagged with a transverse momentum above 50 GeV/c. The event must

Figure 23: Pseudo-rapidity of the highest jet in two jet events for signal and backgrounds.

contain a forward jet above the pseudo-rapidity \(|\eta_{\rm jet}|\geq 2.5\) with a transverse momentum above 50 GeV/c. Selected events are then splitted into two 2 jet and 3 jet final states. Table 10 reports the efficiencies computed for signal and most significant backgrounds in 2 jet and 3 jet final states. Like in the s-channel analysis, the selection is splitted into the two final states \(\rm\overline{t}\rm\overline{b}q\) and \(\rm\overline{t}\rm\overline{b}q\) in order to reduce the contamination from the charge symmetric top pair production. Only the results for the \(\rm\overline{t}\rm\overline{b}q\) final state are shown.

A special treatment is used to estimate the selection efficiencies of W+jets and Wbb events. In order to be able to use the NLO cross-sections reported in Table 3, the selection efficiencies are determined on samples that already mimic the set of cuts applied at the parton level in the MCFM calculations: the relative efficiency is then determined by applying all selection criteria on the pre-selected sub-sample. Regarding the W+jets events, as no b jet is expected in the sample, we determine the relative efficiency using the results of the selection applied on the Wbb sample. The relative efficiency is then the product of the full selection efficiency as determined using the Wbb sample with at least one b-tagged jet, by the probability to get one jet tagged as a b jet among two light jets, which corresponds to 1.98 % for a corresponding mistag rate of 1/100.

In the two-jet final state, signal events are selected with an efficiency of about 1%, leading to a total of 3,000 events in 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). The global signal-to-background ratio is about 3.4.

Table 10: _Absolute efficiency in ATLAS for pre-selected events with at least one b-tagged jet for the 2-jet and 3-jet samples. Numbers are shown for all processes for the selection of the \(\rm\overline{t}\rm\overline{b}q\) final state. Uncertainties come from Monte Carlo statistics only. (*) see in the text for the specific procedure used for W+jets background’s estimates._The dominant background comes from the W+jets production despite the central high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) b jet requirement. The efficiency for those events is well below the per mill level. Remaining backgrounds consists in top pair events in both the "dilepton" and "lepton+jets" channels, although the low multiplicity cut removes most of them. Finally, the contamination from the other (s- and Wt-) single-top channels represents less than 5% of the selected events. Note that no QCDb\(\bar{\mathrm{b}}\) event pass the preselection stage out of 5 millions of generated events.

In three jet final states, the situation is less favorable because of a higher contamination from high multiplicity events like top pair production. Two situations are considered depending on the number of b tagged jet contained in the event. For events with exactly one b tagged jet and two light jets, the signal efficiency is slightly above 1%. The dominant background comes from the top pair production in both the "lepton+jets" and the "dilepton" channels. The contamination from those events amounts to about 40% of the selected sample. As expected, the single-top Wt channel now also constitutes a significant background, representing 2% of the total. The third jet requirement removes most of the W+jet and WQQ backgrounds. The ratio S/B is about 1.2. For events composed with 2 b tagged jets and one light (forward) jet, the signal efficiency is decreased to 0.17%. This is due to the fact that the second b jet present in such events is expected to point towards the very forward region, thus being out of the tracker acceptance. About 50 events are expected in 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). In this case, dominant backgrounds are the top pair events. The ratio S/B is about 1.5, making this channel the least significant in terms of statistical precision.

### Topological selection

At the preselection stage, no use has been made of the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) nor \(\mathrm{M(l\nu b)}\) criteria. We may though consider using those variables to purify the selected sample. This may be the case if a better control of the systematic uncertainty associated to the non top backgrounds (W+jets) events is required.

Figure 24: _Transverse momentum for the forward jet in two jet events and for signal and backgrounds._

Regarding two jet final state events, the application of a lower cut on \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) is used with \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\geq 200\) GeV/c, mainly to ensure that no W+jets or QCD background is selected. A similar reconstructed top mass window to that defined for the s-channel analysis is also used here, i.e. \(120\leq\mathrm{M(\nu b)}\leq 260\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) to improve non-top background rejection. The selection results in a loss of about 16% of signal events compared to the preselection performance, while WQQ and top pair background in the dilepton channels are reduced by about 40%. The final yields are about 2,700 signal events (resp. 1,600) in the \(\mathrm{t\bar{b}q}\) (resp. \(\mathrm{\bar{t}bq}\)) analysis for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). As expected for an asymmetric production of W+jets and single top Wg channels, the ratio S/B is more favourable in the \(\mathrm{t\bar{b}q}\) than in the \(\mathrm{\bar{t}bq}\) final state because of the constant fraction of (symmetrically produced) top pair events. Top pair and W+jets/Wbb events constitute the dominant backgrounds and account for more than a third of the total background each. Fig. 25 displays the corresponding event yields for the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) distribution before the application of the \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) requirement.

For three jet events, the cut on \(\mathrm{H_{T}}\) is slightly increased to 240 GeV/c and the same window in the reconstructed top mass is applied. The final yield for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\)is about 2,680 (1,580) signal events in the \(\mathrm{t\bar{b}q}\) (resp. \(\mathrm{\bar{t}bq}\)) analysis for a corresponding background of 2,170 (2,115) events. In this case, top pair is the most dominant background because of the higher jet multiplicity requirement, while the W+jets contamination is significantly reduced. The ratio S/B is about 1.2 in the \(\mathrm{t\bar{b}q}\) final state. Top pair events accounting for more than 85% of the total background, the ratio S/B is dramatically lowered down to 0.75 in the \(\mathrm{t\bar{b}q}\) final state search. Table 11 reports the event yields expected in both two and three jet final states after the full selection, for an

### Systematic uncertainties

The procedures used to assess systematic uncertainties are already presented in Section 4.5. In this part, we report the results of such methods to estimate the experimental biases affecting the selection efficiencies as well as the uncertainty in the background's estimate.

#### 5.3.1 Experimental systematic uncertainty

As shown in Section 4.5.1, experimental systematics come from the determination of the jet energy scale, the imperfect knowledge of the b-tagging efficiency and mistag rates, and the modeling of initial and final state gluon radiations (ISR and FSR).

##### 5.3.1.1 Jet energy scale

The t-channel selection is particularly sensitive to jet energy scale because the final state involves the presence of a very forward jet in the acceptance. Besides, the use of the reconstructed top mass also makes the analysis sensitive to miscalibration effects. In order to quantify such effect, we vary the energy of each jet from -10% to 10% and fit the variation observed in the selection efficiency. This exercise has been performed independently for the light jet and the b-jet energy scales although both effects are correlated. Fig. 28 reports the variation seen as we vary both energy scales for the signal events. As expected the selection efficiency follows the sign of the jet energy scale variation. A variation of +0.7% per percent of miscalibration factor is measured for the reconstructed light jet, while this number is 1.2% for b-jets. This can be understood as the selection of the b-jet is made with an already high threshold: a small bias towards lower jet energy immediatley reflects in the selection efficiency.

For the main background processes, i.e. the top pair events, this effect is shown to have a slightly more important impact. Fig. 28 shows the effects on the efficiency for the same range of variation. This time, the efficiency decreases of -1.2% per percent of miscalibration for light jets. This can be explained by the observation that jets in top pair production tend to be initially harder than in single top events. An effect that would tend to reduce the jet energy would thus result in a higher number of jets being selected. For b-jets, the same remarks as for the single top events holds and a similar variation of +1.3% per percent of miscalibration is seen.

Overall, a 2% miscalibration in the light jet energy scale and 3% in the b-jet energy scale result in a total systematics of 3.9% for signal events and 4.7% for background events. We conservatively take 5.0% as the systematic uncertainty associated to the knowledge of the jet energy scale. This number may appear as an overestimation since the correlation between light and b- jets energy scale is not taken into account.

#### 5.3.1.2 b-tagging efficiency

The b-tagging is crucial to reject W+jets background. Fig 29 displays the variation of the signal selection efficiency as a function of the b-tagging efficiency. A variation of 1.7% is seen per percent increase of the b-tagging efficiency. As in the s-channel analysis, this change is similar for most backgrounds as seen in Fig. 30 for top pair production. Overall, a variation 5% in the b-tagging efficiency results in a 8.2% variation of the total number of selected events. Flowing the same argument as in the s-channel analysis, we quote 4.1% as our systematic uncertainty associated to the b-tagging uncertainty. As for the mistag rate, it affects the level of remaining W+light jets events. A 5% mistag rate results in a 5% variation of the W+jets events, which translates an uncertainty lower than 3% of the total background estimate for 2-jet final state, and even less for the 3-jet analysis. The total uncertainty quoted associated to b-tagging and mistag rate is thus 5.0%

#### 5.3.1.3 Gluon radiation modeling

We apply a similar procedure to the one reported in Section 4.5.1.3. Table 12 reports the number of events after the full selection with the ISR and FSR alternatively switched ON and OFF for signal and background and both for the 2 jet final states.

ISR dramatically affects the jet multiplicity of the event: switching OFF the initial state gluon radiation results in a reduced jet multiplicity, which in turn results in a relatively higher fraction of events with exactly two jets. Switching OFF Final State gluon radiation tends to limit the energy loss of the final state jets, which results in a higher selection efficiency for those jets. This is reflected in Table 12 which reports the variation of the selected events as ISR and FSR effects are alternatively switched ON and OFF. As mentionned earlier, the t-channel selection is particularly sensitive to such bias since the final state involves the presence of a very forward jet in the acceptance.

For signal events, the observed variation results in an overall systematic uncertainty of 8.6% is quoted. For top pair production events, the magnitude of the effects is less important, with a 7% uncertainty quoted in the 2 jet final state and 4.7% effect in the 3 jet final state. Two jet final state W+jets events are sensitive mostly to the absence of ISR gluon jets which increase their selection efficiency by about 46% while 3 jet final state is dramatically affected by the absence of final state gluon radiation which can lead to more than a factor 10 change in the WQQ background. We therefore quote two uncertainties related to the gluon radiation modeling for both signal and (total) backgrounds. All those effects are of course correlated and should not be treated separately. Overall, an uncertainty of 9% in both two jet and three jet final states. These numbers are obviously an overestimate of the ISR/FSR effects alone, and are quoted here for consistency reason with what has been done in the other single top channel analyses.

#### 5.3.2 Systematic uncertainty on background estimates

We follow the procedure described in Section 4.5.2. The main background is due to the top pair production. Those effects account for 6.0% of the signal cross-section estimate in both two jet and three jet final state analyses.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c c} \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c}{Number of events in 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)} \\ processes & ISR/FSR on & No ISR & No FSR \\ \hline \hline Wg channel & 268 & 283 & 498 \\ \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) ”lepton+jets” & 145 & 220 & 190 \\ \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{Q}\overline{\mathrm{Q}}\) & 73 & 106 & 67 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 12: Number of selected events after the application of the full selection with the effect of switching ON/OFF the ISR/FSR.

### Summary

With a cross-section corresponding to about a third of that for the top pair production, the t-channel processes will be the first single-top production accessible with the early data at the LHC. Contrary to the situation at the TeVatron, the main background comes from the top pair production, well above the W+jets and WQQ events. The statistical precision is about 4% for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)and well below 1% with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). Fig. 31 shows the statistical sensitivity as a function of the integrated luminosity.

However, this measurement will be limited by the systematic errors. The dominant uncertainties comes from the jet energy scale and the ISR/FSR modeling, which affect directly the selection efficiencies for both signal and backgrounds. The b-tagging systematic error is expected to be reduced compared to the s-channel analysis where two b-tags were required. The uncertainty associated to the background estimate is again a major source of error and, as in the s-channel case, will require the use of data itself. With a simple selection, the precision on the cross-section is expected to be:

\[\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma}=1.0\%_{\rm stat}\pm 11.0\%_{\rm exp}\pm 6\%_{\rm bckgd \ theo}\pm 5\%_{\rm lumi}\ \rm for\ L=30\ fb^{-1}\]

which shows how sensitive the selection is to the experimental and background estimates effects. Same remarks as for the s-channel measurement apply.

Figure 31: _Statistical precision as a function of the luminosity for the t-channel analysis in two- and three- jet events and for \(\bar{t}bq\) and \(\bar{t}bq\) final states. The result of the combination of all channels is also shown._Single-top Wt-channel cross-section measurement

The Wt-channel is the second largest source of single top production. Due to the presence of a second W boson in the final state, Wt events are topologically similar to t\(\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) background events and a clear discrimination is thus difficult to achieve.

### Event selection

As for the s and t-channels, we select W+t events by requiring a single high p\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\) lepton and a high missing transverse energy. Such a selection criteria implies that one W boson decays leptonically and that the second W boson must decay into two jets. Therefore, the selected events have exactly three jets with one of them tagged as a b-jet. This jet multiplicity requirement allows to reject part of t\(\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) background. In addition, by requiring a 2-jet invariant mass within a window around the W boson mass, it is possible to eliminate most events that do not contain a second W, i.e. all backgrounds other than t\(\overline{\mathrm{t}}\). Indeed, as shown in Fig. 32, a sharp peak in the 2-jet invariant mass distribution is observed for the W+t and t\(\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events.

### Efficiencies and background rejection

The selection for the W+t analysis requires the presence of an isolated high p\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\) lepton above 25 GeV/c and missing transverse energy above 25 GeV/c. In addition, a secondary lepton veto cut is applied to any lepton above 10 GeV/c with a sign opposite to that of the selected high p\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\) lepton, similarly to both W* and Wg analyses. The event must contain, among the three jets of p\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\) above 25 GeV/c, one b-tagged jet with a transverse momentum greater than 50 GeV/c. An additional constraint on the 2-jet invariant mass (55-85 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)) is then added to discriminate from W+jets, QCD and the other single top events.

The efficiencies and the numbers of events expected for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\)are reported in Table 13. The corresponding individual signal-to-background ratios are also tabu

Figure 32: 2-jet invariant mass for signal and backgrounds.

lated in Table 13. The calculated values include only the electron/positron contribution of the leptonic components.

The \(\mathrm{W+t}\) events are selected with an efficiency of about 4.6%. Top pair events are selected with a global efficiency of around 1.7% (3.3% for the "lepton+jets" channel, which is the main \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background). As expected, the other sources of background are greatly reduced by the selection criteria ; we obtain efficiencies less than 0.05% for \(\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{Z}\)+jets channels and 0.2%-0.3% for the two other single top production channels.

The predicted global signal-to-background ratio for the Wt-channel is 0.096 and the main background contribution comes from the top pair production in the "lepton+jets" channel. The signal-to-background ratio can be slightly improved (by a factor of 10%) by applying further cuts on the total transverse momentum and on the centrality variable defined as:

\[\mathrm{centrality}=\frac{\Sigma_{\mathrm{jet}}\ \mathrm{p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}}}{ \Sigma_{\mathrm{jet}}\ \mathrm{p^{\mathrm{jet}}}}\]

As we can clearly see in Fig. 33, centrality values are much larger for the Wt events than for most of background events. As expected top pair events and the other single top mechanisms lead to lower values of centrality whereas the distribution is rather flat for signal events.

The performance in terms of statistical sensitivity has been determined for the three jet final state events and shows that a 10% sensitivity can be achieved with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)by combining both electron and muon channels. Figs. 34 and 35 display the event yields for the total transverse momentum and centrality for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), respectively.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:40]

In order to enhance the global efficiency of the selection, events with only two jets of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) above 25 GeV/c, one being a b-tagged jet, were also considered. The selection is much less restrictive than in the previous case since no constraint on the jet invariant mass can be applied. The obtained efficiencies and expected individual signal-to-background ratios are reported in Table 14. For such a sample of events, the efficiency is about 6.6%, a third more than for the three jets events. But, as expected, the background contributions coming from the top pair production and from the two other single top channels are much higher. The global signal-to-background ratio for the Wt-channel becomes in this case 0.081.

### Systematic uncertainties

#### 6.3.1 Experimental systematic uncertainty

As shown in Section 4.5.1, experimental systematics come from the determination of the jet energy scale, the imperfect knowledge of the b-tagging efficiency and mistag rates, and the modeling of initial and final state gluon radiations (ISR and FSR).

#### 6.3.1.1 Jet energy scale

To estimate the effects of the uncertainty in the jet energy scale, we apply the method defined in 5.3.1.1. The Wt analysis is sensitive to the JES since it requires the reconstruction of the hadronic W boson mass in the three jet final state.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline Process & Efficiency & Nb of events & Individual S/B ratio \\ \hline \hline W+t-channel & \(6.59\pm 0.02\) & \(18,504\pm 54\) & \\ s-channel & \(3.78\pm 0.01\) & \(1195\pm 4\) & \(15\) \\ t-channel & \(7.43\pm 0.03\) & \(56,978\pm 207\) & \(0.32\) \\ \hline \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background & & & \\ \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\to\) e\(\nu\)b jjb & \(4.09\pm 0.01\) & \(149,730\pm 429\) & \(0.12\) \\ \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\to\) e\(\nu\)b e\(\nu\)b & \(2.53\pm 0.02\) & \(7,322\pm 55\) & \(2.53\) \\ \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\to\tau\nu\)b \(\tau\nu\)b & \(0.78\pm 0.01\) & \(2,232\pm 29\) & \(8.3\) \\ \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\to\tau\nu\)b jjb & \(0.27\pm 0.01\) & \(9,662\pm 132\) & \(1.9\) \\ \hline W/Z+jets background & & & \\ \(\mathrm{Wb\bar{b}}\to\) e\(\nu\) b\(\mathrm{\bar{b}}\) & \(0.20\pm 0.001\) & \(306\pm 5\) & \(60\) \\ \(\mathrm{Wjj}\to\) e\(\nu\) jj & negl. & negl. & - \\ \(\mathrm{WZ}\to\) e\(\nu\) b\(\mathrm{\bar{b}}\) & \(1.27\pm 0.02\) & \(327\pm 4\) & \(57\) \\ \(\mathrm{Zb\bar{b}}\to\) e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) b\(\mathrm{\bar{b}}\) & \(0.16\pm 0.02\) & \(108\pm 5\) & \(171\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 14: _Two jet final state events. Efficiency, number of events expected for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)and individual signal-to-background ratio for single top processes and background channels. Uncertainties come from Monte Carlo statistics only._The energy scale of each jet is varied from -10% to 10% and we fit the variation observed in the selection efficiency. Fig. 36 reports the variation seen as we vary both energy scales for the signal events. As expected the selection efficiency follows the sign of the jet energy scale variation. A variation of +0.6% per percent of miscalibration factor is measured for the reconstructed light jet, while this number is 1.2% for b-jets.

For the main background processes, i.e. the top pair events, this effect is shown to have a slightly more important impact. Fig. 37 shows the effects on the efficiency for the same range of variation. This time, the efficiency decreases of -0.8% per percent of miscalibration for light jets, which is expected for a jet veto applied on events containing a high mulitplicity of hard jets. For b-jets, a (positive) variation of +0.9% per percent of miscalibration is seen, as expected.

Overall, a 2% miscalibration in the light jet energy scale and 3% in the b-jet energy scale result in a total systematics of 3.8% for signal events and 3.1% for the main background. We conservatively take 4.0% as the systematic uncertainty associated to the knowledge of the jet energy scale.

#### b-tagging efficiency

We proceed here as in Section 5.3.1.2. Fig 38 displays the variation of the signal selection efficiency as a function of the b-tagging efficiency. A variation of 1.5% is seen for a percent increase of the b-tagging efficiency. This change is slightly less for top pair backgrounds, with a variation of 0.6% for top pair production, as seen in Fig. 39. Overall, we quote the variation corresponding to a 5% uncertainty in the b-tagging efficiency. A systematics of 7.5% is quoted for this analysis.

#### 6.3.1.3 Gluon radiation modeling

The effect of the ISR/FSR gluon radiation is assessed as in Section 5.3.1.3. As expected this effect is more important for two jet events than for the three jet selected events. For the main background, i.e. top pair production events, the magnitude of the effects is important in the two jet final state, with a 7% uncertainty. This effect is decreased to 4.2% in the 3 jet final state. At the time of the note, we did not have samples of W+t without FSR or ISR gluon radiations. As the final number of events is mainly driven by the top pair production, we choose to use those numbers as systematic uncertainties related to the gluon radiation modeling.

#### 6.3.2 Systematic uncertainty on background estimates

All of the background estimates rely upon Monte Carlo that are used to compute the selection efficiencies. We proceed here as in Section 4.5.2. These errors come from the uncertainties on the t-channel (70% of the background) and on the s-channel (30% of the background) and lead to a total error of 9.1% in three-jet final state selection. A similar result is achieved in the two-jet final state, where again, the top pair production constitutes our main background.

### Summary

The Wt channel analysis benefits from the relative high cross-section of about 70 pb. However, due to high similarities with top pair events, the selection is hampered by a high level of background contamination. This characteristics makes the Wt cross-section very difficult to measure with the early data at the LHC. The chosen strategy is based on the splitting of the event selection into two jet and three jet final states. In both cases, the main background comes from the top pair production with a S/B ratio well below 10%, making the prior precise determination of the top pair production cross-section mandatory. Combining both electron and muon channels as well as all two and three jet final states leads to a statistical precision slightly below 6% for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). This translates into a precision of about 2-3% at the end of the low luminosity run. Fig. 40 shows the statistical sensitivity as function of the integrated luminosity.

The precision on the cross-section determination is limited by the systematic uncertainties, as shown in the three jet analysis :

\[\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma}=1.5\%_{\text{stat}}\pm 11\%_{\text{exp}}\pm 9.1 \%_{\text{bckgd~{}theo}}\pm 5\%_{\text{lumi}}\text{ for L}=30~{}\text{fb}^{-1}\]

The dominant uncertainties come from the jet energy scale and the ISR/FSR modeling, which affect directly the selection efficiencies for both signal and backgrounds. The b-tagging systematic error is also expected to play a significant role. Again, the uncertainty associated to the top pair background estimate is a major source of error and will require the use of data itself.

Conclusion

We investigate in this report the ATLAS potential for the determination of the single top production cross-sections. The performance are established for a low luminosity run at \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\).s\({}^{-1}\) and an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). We present a strategy to measure all three components of the single top cross-sections, the s-channel, the gluon fusion channel and the associated production of a top quark and a W boson. As the three single top production modes result in very distinct final state topologies, optimized selection criteria are proposed for each channel. The interpretation of such measurements in terms of V\({}_{\rm tb}\), sensitivity to extra bosons and anomalous couplings will be the subject of other studies.

The t-channel analysis appears as the most favourable case of the three, due to the high production cross-section. Because of very specific features in the final state topology, it also benefits from a very favourable signal over background ratio. The precision that can be achieved is:

\[\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma}=1.0\%_{\rm stat}\pm 11.0\%_{\rm exp}\pm 6\%_{ \rm bckgd\ theo}\pm 5\%_{\rm lumi}\ {\rm for}\ {\rm L}=30\ {\rm fb}^{-1}\]

which makes this channel the most promising one for the early data. In this case, the measurement is dominated by the systematic uncertainties. A reliable determination of the jet energy scale is mandatory, especially in the difficult region of high rapidity. The modeling of the gluon radiation is also crucial because the analysis is very sensitive to the performance of the jet veto. As W+jets constitute a significant background, the b-tagging performance is important, specially for two jet final state events.

For the s-channel analysis, the determination of the cross-section is limited both by the statistics and the systematic uncertainties:

\[\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma}=12\%_{\rm stat}\pm 12\%_{\rm exp}\pm 11\%_{\rm bckgd \ theo}\pm 5\%_{\rm lumi}\ {\rm for}\ {\rm L}=30\ {\rm fb}^{-1}\]

This channel is the most delicate one because it requires a reliable estimate of top pair background on one hand and W+jets events on the other hand. This analysis depends crucially upon the performance of the b-tagging since two b-jets are required to be reconstructed and identified. Finally, the use of a jet veto requires a good understanding of the initial and final state gluon radiations, which appear as a significant effect in the present result.

Finally, the Wt channel benefits from an important cross-section but is swamped in a high level of contamination from top pair events. The knowledge of the other two single top contamination is also required. The precision that has been reached is:

\[\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma}=1.5\%_{\rm stat}\pm 11\%_{\rm exp}\pm 9.1\%_{ \rm bckgd\ theo}\pm 5\%_{\rm lumi}\ {\rm for}\ {\rm L}=30\ {\rm fb}^{-1}\]

which, again, shows that the measurement is dominated by the systematic uncertainties. As in the previous analyses, a good determination of the jet energy scale, the modeling of gluon radiation as well as b-tagging performance play an important role.

Overall, these measurements show the importance of a good understanding of the background, which must result in a reliable estimate of top pair and W+jets contamination in the different analyses. A good control of the experimental systematics is also shown important, especially the jet energy scale and the b-tagging. These strategies also show the need for control samples in order to be able to reliably model the effects of gluon radiations and the underlying events.

Finally, it is obvious that the use of more sophisticated methods based on likelihood or Neural Network will bring significant improvements by reducing the level of backgrounds that affect the single top channels. The definition of such procedures and their expected performance are the object of specific studies within the top group and will be reported in future publications.
