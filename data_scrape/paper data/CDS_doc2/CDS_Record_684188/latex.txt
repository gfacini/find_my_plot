TRIUMF Proton Irradiation Facility

The TRIUMF Proton Irradiation Facility (PIF), in Vancouver, was used to irradiate the FPGAs. The PIF provides two proton beams that cover an energy range between 10 MeV and 500 MeV. The protons of the lower-energy beam have an energy range between 10 MeV and 120 MeV. A range of beam energies was obtained using two primary extraction energies, 60 MeV and 120 MeV, and a degrader to obtain energies below the primary energies. The primary energies could be set in approximately ten minutes while degrader settings took about a minute. The energy resolution of the beam varied between 2% with no degrader, to 50% with the degrader on its maximum setting. The proton fluxes at the PIF range between \(10^{5}\) proton/cm\({}^{2}\)/s and \(10^{8}\) proton/cm\({}^{2}\)/s. For a beam diameter of about 2 cm, the proton flux has a uniform intensity to within approximately 5%. The total ionizing dose and proton fluence were measured with an ionization chamber calibrated at the position of the device. The uncertainty in the calibration was 5%. Both total ionizing dose and proton fluence were monitored in real time.

## 3 Test Procedure

The device under test (DUT) was mounted in the proton beam with its top perpendicular to the beam axis. A laser was used to align the DUT with the point in the beam where the calibrations had been carried out. A small telescope was used to ensure that the DUT was centred on the beam (Figure 1). Using a collimator, the beam diameter was set to 25 mm such that it completely covered the die of the device.

### Test Board

The DUT was mounted in a chip carrier with a snap-down lid on a small printed circuit (PC) test board (Figure 2). In addition to the DUT and socket, the PC board contained a 40 MHz oscillator, switches, connectors, LEDs, and a small number of passive components. A section of the lid of the chip carrier was removed above the DUT to minimize the material between the beam and the die. A schematic of the test setup is shown in Figure 3. A data acquisition (DAQ) computer was used to monitor the internal status register of the DUT. The power-supply current of the DUT was monitored during the test to observe the effects of total ionizing dose and possible latch-up. A signal generator (pulser) was used to trigger the DUT into operation. A remote computer, located outside of the radiation test room, was connected to a digital multi-meter and data acquisition computer for logging data.

### Device Under Test

The device tested was the Xilinx XC4036XLA-09HQ240C FPGA. This SRAM-based FPGA is fabricated in a 0.25 \(\mu\)m/0.35 \(\mu\)m hybrid process. The device is composed of an array of 36 by 36 user configurable logic blocks (CLBs), which are configured by switches. The configuration logic blocks offer up to either 41,000 bits of RAM or 36,000 logic gates. A typical gate range for a mixed logic and RAM configuration would be between 22,000Figure 1: Test arrangement at the TRIUMF Proton Irradiation Facility showing the proton beam and device alignment.

Figure 2: The PC test board used for the tests. A section of the snap-down lid above the chip has been removed to minimize the material between the beam and the die.

and \(65,000\) gates. The FPGA operates at \(3.3\) V and was housed in an HQ240C package. This is a \(240\)-pin plastic-molded surface-mount quad flat-pack. The body thickness was \(3.4\) mm and there is an embedded metal heat sink at the bottom of the package [4].

The DUT was configured with the circuit which will be used to control the switched capacitor arrays on the LAr calorimeter front-end readout board in ATLAS. This logic circuit was totally synchronous and was clocked at \(40\) MHz. Portions of the circuit ran continuously and others were triggered into operation at a rate between \(10\) kHz and \(20\) kHz with pulses provided by the pulser previously mentioned. The circuit occupied approximately \(90\%\) of the configuration logic and was comprised of roughly \(50\%\) sequential and combinational logic, and \(50\%\) RAM. Further details pertaining to this circuit can be found in reference [5].

### Upset Detection

A monitoring program running on the local DAQ computer continuously polled a status register [6]. If an upset caused the circuit to operate incorrectly, diagnostic circuits in the DUT would detect it and set a bit in the register. In addition, if an upset occurred in the diagnostic circuitry it could cause the circuit to miss-identify an error and set a bit in the status register. The circuit contained a pipeline of sequential numbers and any upset that affected the circuit would propagate through the circuit and manifest itself as an out-of-sequence number. If a bit was set in the status register, the monitoring program issued a reset. The reset caused a fresh set of sequential number to be loaded into the

Figure 3: The test setup showing the test board in relation to the local and remote data acquisition computers and additional monitoring equipment.

RAM and the state machines were re-initialized. If three successive resets (within a time frame of one second) did not restore the circuit to an operating condition, where no errors were detected, the FPGA was reconfigured. If a circuit reset could clear an upset, the upset was assumed to have occurred in the CLBs. If a reset would not clear the upset, it was assumed to have occurred in the configuration switches, which would not be affected by a reset.

## 4 Results

Six FPGAs were irradiated for the test. The cross-section was given, by definition, as

\[\sigma=\frac{N}{\Phi}\quad, \tag{1}\]

where \(N\) was the number of recorded proton induced upsets and \(\Phi\) was the proton fluence during the irradiation period.

A correction was applied to the number of observed upsets in order to account for those missed during reconfiguration. When an upset occurred it was most often the case that the FPGA required reconfiguring in order to continue normal operation. The reconfiguration procedure took (8 \(\pm\) 1) s. Poisson statistics were used to estimate the number of upsets missed during this time. The actual number of upsets was thus given by

\[N=N_{Obs}+\sum_{\nu=1,2,3,\ldots}P(\nu)\cdot N_{D}\quad, \tag{2}\]

where \(N\) and \(N_{Obs}\) were the actual and measured number of upsets respectively, \(P(\nu)\) were the probabilities of 1, 2, 3, etcetera, upsets coming during the download time, and \(N_{D}\) was the number of circuit downloads. Only \(P(1)\) and \(P(2)\) were used in the calculations as \(P(3)\) only contributed at the 0.01% level. The uncertainty in this procedure was estimated by propagating the statistical uncertainty in \(N_{Obs}\), along with that in the deadtime, and the mean time between upsets.

We were able to measure the number of single-event upsets for the CLBs and configuration switches separately, and thus the single-event upset (SEU) cross-section for each was determined. The numbers of CLB and configuration switch upsets for each energy are listed in Table 11. No upset requiring a circuit reset was observed for a proton energy of 57.7 MeV. We have thus included the 68.3% upper limit in the table.

Footnote 1: While the units for cross-section are given in upset-area/device it should be understood that the cross-section is also “per proton”. The proton was left out as it is not technically a unit. While “device” is not a unit, it was left in to maintain consistency with the literature on the subject

The upset cross-sections for the total device and configuration switches are shown in Figure 4, while the CLB upset cross-section is shown in Figure 5. A fit was made to the total cross-section versus energy data using a three-parameter empirical function in order to extract the threshold energy and saturation cross-section. The saturation cross-section was given by one of the fit parameters, and represented the limit of the cross-section as the energy approached infinity, while the threshold energy was taken to be the energy at which the cross-section dropped by 50% from the saturation value. Due to the limit statistics, the CLB upset cross-section did not appear to have any functional form so the data was averaged to give a single cross-section. It was not possible to determine, with confidence, the threshold energy value for the CLB SEU cross-section. The values for the threshold energies and saturation cross-sections are given in Table 2.

The uncertainties in the configuration switch upset cross-sections were between 20% and 40% of the values, while in the CLBs the uncertainties varied between 30% and 100% of the cross-section values. The dominant contribution to the errors were the statistical fluctuation in the number of detected upsets. Additional uncertainties in the cross-section values came from the procedure that corrected for any upsets that may have occurred during the deadtime introduced by a circuit reconfiguration (a contribution of about 5%) and the 7% uncertainty in proton flux. The 7% uncertainty in proton flux comes from a 5% uncertainty in the flux uniformity over the die surface and a 5% uncertainty in the calibration of the dosimeter. The uncertainty in the energy was attributed to the energy straggling of the protons through the degrader. This was estimated using the SRIM code [7]. All data used in the calculations is tabulated in Appendix A.

Bit Normalization

The cross-sections presented in the last section were specific to a particular circuit configured in the DUT. In general it is desirable to have a value for the cross-section per bit. This allows the prediction of upset cross-sections for other circuits in the same device. The XC4036XLA FPGA contains a total of 832,528 configurable bits. The CLBs were laid out in an array of 36 by 36 blocks and contain about 129,600 bits, or 16% of the total bits. Of the remaining configurable bits, 10% are used for I/O, circuit configuration, and read-back, which were not used in our test. The remaining 632,600 bits make up the configuration switches [8]. These values were used to normalize the SEU cross-sections to a value per bit. Figure 6 shows a plot of upset cross-section versus proton energy for the configuration switches, CLBs, and total device.

## 6 Particle Energy Spectra in Electronics Region

The spectra (flux as a function of energy) for neutrons, photons, protons, pions, and electrons have been calculated2 in the region of the LAr calorimeter readout electronics

Figure 6: The single-event upset cross-section for the total device (circles), configuration logic blocks (triangles), and configuration switches (squares) normalized by the number of bits.

(Figure 7). To obtain these spectra a full simulation of particles passing through the ATLAS detector was made and the radiation levels in the electronics region were extracted. The GEANT 3 simulation package with the GCALOR interface was used.

Uncertainty in these spectra comes from a number of sources: event generation, shower models, neutron transport, geometry, materials, and statistics. It is not possible, in the time prior to the commission of the detector, to address each of these factors in order that a confident value of the uncertainty in the background radiation calculation can be stated. A safety factor of 3.5 has been suggested to account for these uncertainties [1].

## 7 Proton Upset Rate

The upset rate due to protons was calculated using the SEU cross-section for the device and the proton energy spectrum described in the previous section. The upset rate is given by

\[R=\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}\sigma\frac{d\phi}{dE}dE\quad, \tag{3}\]

where \(\sigma\) is the SEU cross-section, \(\phi\) is the proton flux, and \(E\) is the proton energy. It can be seen in Figure 8 that upsets will occur between 18 MeV and 10 GeV, with the majority occurring between 30 MeV and 200 MeV.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

Single-Event Latch-Up

The single-event upsets discussed thus far are "soft" in that they can be cleared without permanently affecting the device. One type of single-event phenomenon which can possibly create damage within a device is single-event latch-up (SEL). Latch-up is defined as a state of a device where low impedance paths between transistors exist. This condition can burn out the device if it is not powered down. If the device is powered down quickly, permanent damage may be avoided.

Single-event latch-up will be observed as a sudden increase in current which can only be cleared by a power-down. A fuse was installed between the DUT and the power supply in order to prevent damage to the device. To search for latch-up we exposed one device at our maximum energy of 105 MeV to a total fluence of (5.9 \(\pm\) 0.3)\(\times\) 10\({}^{11}\) proton/cm\({}^{2}\). One latch-up was observed. This event corresponded to a single-event latch-up rate of 1.7 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-12}\) latch-up\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\)/device. Using Poisson statistics, the single-event latch-up cross-section falls between \(8.5\times 10^{-14}\) latch-up\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\)/device and \(8.7\times 10^{-12}\) latch-up\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\)/device with a 95% confidence level. The error in the proton fluence and simulated proton flux have not been included in the confidence-level interval calculations. No specific tests for latch-up were performed at energies below 105 MeV. Using the estimated proton flux at each energy we have calculated lower limits on the mean time between latch-up at each proton energy setting. The results are tabulated in Table 4. For the one observed latch-up event, we can set an upper limit of eight years.

## 9 Total Ionizing Dose Effects

An additional concern when testing for SEU is that the protons deposit charge within the devices. Total ionizing dose deposited in the DUT could cause an increase in power supply current, which might at some point affect the SEU measurements. To alleviate

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c|} \hline
**Energy** & **Proton Flux** & **Latch-Ups** & **Lower Limit** \\
**(MeV)** & **(Hz/cm\({}^{2}\))** & **Observed** & **(Days)** \\ \hline
18.0 & 10 & 0 & 4.8 \\
20.0 & 10 & 0 & 7.7 \\
26.9 & 17 & 0 & 2.7 \\

\end{table}
Table 4: Lower limits on the mean time between latch-up in ATLAS at the 95% confidence level. The estimated fluxes are for the region of the LAr calorimeter electronics.

this concern, the exposure of the DUT was stopped shortly after it absorbed more than 20 \(\mathrm{krad}\,(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})\).

The total absorbed dose for each device under test is listed in Table 5. A correction to the measured dose was applied since the dosimeter was calibrated at the face of the DUT rather than at the die. The SRIM simulation package was used to calculate the dose at the die after the protons had passed through the device packaging.

DUT #3 absorbed more dose than anticipated since it was irradiated at a proton energy of 20 \(\mathrm{MeV}\), which is the energy at which protons stop in the material of the die. We allowed DUT #5 to absorb a large dose since it was the DUT we used for single-event latch-up testing. The power supply current versus time was recorded for DUT #5 so that we could compare with our earlier total ionizing dose tests using gammas [6]. The current was found to start increasing at about 7.4 \(\mathrm{krad}\,(\mathrm{SiO}_{2})\) when irradiated with protons which was less than the average of (16 \(\pm\) 3) \(\mathrm{krad}\,(\mathrm{Si})\) measured for the same type of device irradiated with gammas. We have no explanation for this discrepancy.

## 10 Estimate of Upset Rates for Neutrons and Pions

Estimates for the upset rates due to neutrons and pions are desirable because of the large fluxes of the particles in the region of the electronics for the LAr calorimeter. While it would be preferable to measure the SEU cross-sections for neutrons and pions separately, estimates can be made using proton data. To relate the SEU cross-sections of the different particles, the relative non-ionizing energy loss (NIEL) cross-sections can be used. We make the assumption that the amount of fragmentation of the silicon nuclei is proportional to the NIEL cross-sections. It is known that the neutron and proton NIEL cross-sections are approximately equal above a few tens of \(\mathrm{MeV}\)[9] and thus the same cross-section used for the proton upset rate calculation was used for the neutron calculation. The pion NIEL cross-section is smaller than the proton NIEL cross-section, by as much as a factor of four, between 10 \(\mathrm{MeV}\) and 120 \(\mathrm{MeV}\), and a correction was made to the SEU cross-section to reflect this difference. To make the correction, the ratio of the pion NIEL cross-section [10] over the proton NIEL cross-section was multiplied by the proton induced SEU cross-section. This correction was made to the pion cross-section at each energy of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l|r||} \hline
**Device** & **Absorbed Dose** \\  & **(krad(SiO\({}_{2}\)))** \\ \hline DUT \#1 & 6.3 \\ DUT \#2 & 28.1 \\ DUT \#3 & 50.7 \\ DUT \#4 & 0.0 \\ DUT \#5 & 38.4 \\ DUT \#6 & 14.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Total ionizing dose absorbed by each devices under test. A correction was made to extrapolate the dose from the face of the package to the die.

the proton beam. Once the SEU corrected cross-section was obtained, the procedure for calculating the upset rate was identical to that described above for protons. The total device upset rates and mean time between upsets are listed in Table 6.

## 11 Comparison With Existing Models

Figure 9 shows a comparison of our SEU cross-section data with three existing models: the one parameter Bendel model [11], the two parameter Bendel model [12], and a modified two-parameter Bendel model [13]. The parameters for the fits made to the data are tabulated in Table 7. In all cases the models do not describe the data very well and thus we have not reproduced the functional forms of the models here. The one parameter Bendel model was fit to the data and gave a value of 30 MeV. This parameter loosely corresponds to the threshold energy. Neither the threshold energy or saturation cross-section are well described by this model. To demonstrate the effect of using a parameter more closely resembling the measured threshold energy, the \(A\) parameter was fixed at 22 MeV and the model superimposed on the data. We see that it is not possible to describe both the threshold energy and saturation cross-section with the one-parameter Bendel model. The two parameter Bendel model has an additional parameter to allow greater flexibility in fitting the data near the threshold energy and the saturation of the cross-section at high energies. An improvement in matching the observed threshold energy was made but the saturation cross-section did not closely approximate the data. The modified Bendel model uses a single parameter to describe the saturation value of the cross-section and another parameter to describe the low energy behaviour. It did indeed fit the asymptotic behaviour of the data at high energies better than the one parameter and two parameter Bendel models, but it did not describe the energy threshold region with sufficient accuracy.

Good agreement between our data and the models is not necessarily expected since the models were made for devices with feature sizes3 greater than 1 \(\mu\)m. Also, the models are based on the ionization caused by the silicon ions which are knocked forward by the incident protons. The contribution of charge deposited into the devices by the protons

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l|c|c|c||} \hline
**Particle** & **Device Upset Rate** & **ATLAS Upset Rate** & **Mean Time Between** \\  & **(upset/s)** & **(upset/s)** & **Upsets (min)** \\ \hline Protons & \(9.4\times 10^{-8}\) & \(2.9\times 10^{-4}\) & 57 \\ Neutrons & \(5.7\times 10^{-6}\) & \(1.7\times 10^{-2}\) & 1.0 \\ Pions & \(1.1\times 10^{-7}\) & \(3.4\times 10^{-4}\) & 49 \\ \hline Hadrons & \(5.9\times 10^{-6}\) & \(1.8\times 10^{-2}\) & 0.9 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

themselves have been neglected. Once the feature size approaches 0.5 \(\mu\)m the effect of ionization caused by the protons themselves becomes important [14]. An additional complication is that the feature size of the XC4036XLA is a combination of 0.25 \(\mu\)m and 0.35 \(\mu\)m. 0.25 \(\mu\)m design rules are used for the five-layer interconnects, but the transistors are built with a channel length of 0.35 \(\mu\)m to support the 3.3 V operating voltage.

To allow interpolation and integration of the cross-section to estimate upset rates, we resorted to fitting an empirical function to the cross-section data, given by

\[\sigma=\sigma_{sat}\tanh\left[a(E-E_{thresh})\right]\quad, \tag{4}\]

where \(\sigma_{sat}\) is the saturation cross-section, \(E_{thresh}\) is the threshold energy, \(E\) is the proton energy, and \(a\) is a shape parameter. The results of this fit are also shown in Figure 9.

## 12 Discussion

Application specific integrated circuits (ASIC) have the advantage of not containing the switching circuitry of FPGAs. The reduced gate count alone should reduce the number of upsets. By unfolding the contribution to the SEU cross-section of the configuration logic blocks and configuration switches for the FPGA it is possible to predict the upset rate in an ASIC made with the same technology as the FPGA we have tested. Based on our

Figure 9: Single-event upset cross-section data fit with three models and a three-parameter empirical function.

results we would expect an ASIC to operate about an order magnitude longer between upsets.

Using our cross-section data we aim to develop a model which is consistent with the data for devices of sub-micron feature size. The purpose of such a model is to be able characterize a device with only a few measurements. One approach to developing such a model is to include the effects of direct ionization of the protons along with the effects caused by spallation reaction products.

We intend to continue studying the effects of radiation on FPGAs, as well as, the single-event effects on a radiation hardened ASIC implementing the same circuit design as used in these tests [15].

## 13 Summary

The proton induced SEU cross-section was measured for the Xilinx XC4036XA FPGA. The saturation cross-section was determined to be (2.7 \(\pm\) 0.2)\(\times 10^{-9}\) upset\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\)/device, while the threshold energy was determined to be (22 \(\pm\) 2) MeV. The SEU cross-sections for the CLBs and configuration switches were determined separately. The saturation cross-sections for the configuration switches and CLBs were (2.6 \(\pm\) 0.2)\(\times\) 10\({}^{-9}\) upset\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\)/device and (4 \(\pm\) 1)\(\times\) 10\({}^{-9}\) upset\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\)/device respectively. The threshold for the configuration switches was also determined to be (22 \(\pm\) 2) MeV.

The cross-sections were used to predict the upset rates for the device in ATLAS. The device had an estimated upset rate of 9 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-8}\) upsets/device/s, or roughly one upset every four months. The upset rate in the entire detector, which will contain 3,072 devices, was estimated to be 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-4}\) upsets/s, or about one upset every hour.

At 105 MeV, the single-event latch-up cross-section was calculated to lie in the range 7.9 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-14}\) latch-up\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\)/device to 8.2 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-12}\) latch-up\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\)/device within a 95% confidence level. Based on these limits we would expect at least one latch-up in ATLAS in less than eight years. Lower limits for the mean time between latch-ups have been set for proton energies below 105 MeV.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||l|c|l||} \hline
**Model** & **Parameter** & **Fit Results** \\ \hline \hline One Parameter Bendel & \(A\) & 30 MeV \\ \hline One Parameter Bendel & \(A\) & 22 MeV (held fixed) \\ \hline Two Parameter Bendel & \(A\) & 14.6 MeV \\  & \(B\) & 11.4 MeV \\ \hline Modified Bendel & \(A\) & 3.7 MeV \\  & \(S\) & 5.4 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-9}\) upset\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\)/device \\ \hline Empirical Function & \(\sigma_{sat}\) & 3.6 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-9}\) upset\(\cdot\)cm\({}^{2}\)/device \\  & \(E_{thresh}\) & 18 MeV, \\  & \(a\) & 0.11 MeV\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: Results of the fits to the cross-section data for the different models and an empirical function.

Based on the relative energy spectra of protons, neutrons, and pions we have estimated the upset rates for all three of these hadrons by comparing their nuclear cross-sections over the energy range of interest. The estimated mean time between upsets due to all hadrons in ATLAS is about one minute.

The SEU cross-section for the CLBs can be used as an estimate of the SEU cross-section for an application specific integrated circuit in the same CMOS technology. If an ASIC device with the same internal structure of the CLBs but without the switching infrastructure was used for the switched capacitor array controller, the proton induced upset rate would decrease by an order of magnitude.
