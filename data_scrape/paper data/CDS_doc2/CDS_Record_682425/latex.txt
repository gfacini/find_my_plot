**Abstract**

This study presents an overview of the Standard Model and Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model Higgs rates, backgrounds and significances expected for the ATLAS detector at LHC. Since the submission of the ATLAS TP, much has changed however in the overall picture of the MSSM Higgs sector. In particular, more complete theoretical calculations are now available, and, more importantly, much more work was done in an attempt at performing a more systematic analysis of the MSSM Higgs sector. This includes a more or less automatic procedure to produce the contour curves in the MSSM parameter space and the analysis of channels not considered at the time of the TP. This part of the work is still ongoing and will be documented in a separate note in the near future. Both this SM part and the existing draft of the MSSM part can be found on WWW under the ATLAS physics page.

Introduction

This note describes in detail the most recent evaluations of rates for signal and background processes, for the electroweak symmetry breaking sector of both the Standard Model (SM) and of one of its possible supersymmetric extensions, the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM).

Present experimental knowledge leaves this sector of the electroweak theory largely unconstrained. Theoretical scenarios tend to fall in one of two classes: either this sector is weakly coupled, and the symmetry breaking sector contains one or more Higgs bosons below \(\sim 1\) TeV in mass, or this sector is strongly coupled, and more complex behaviour is expected at the TeV scale. The many theoretical advantages of supersymmetric extensions of the SM require that the corresponding scale for the masses of the supersymmetric partners of ordinary particles cannot be significantly larger than the scale for electroweak symmetry breaking. The LHC has a crucial role to play in either uncovering or excluding these extensions to the SM.

The recent evidence for top-quark production at the Tevatron [1], although not yet of sufficient precision to directly constrain the Higgs mass through electroweak radiative corrections, has somewhat reshaped the traditional picture of the Higgs sector. In particular, if the top-quark mass \(m_{t}\) is larger than 160 GeV, considerations of the stability of the SM Higgs potential suggest that a Higgs boson mass \(m_{H}\)lower than 100 GeV could only occur if some new physics causes the SM to break down below a mass scale of \(\sim 10\) TeV [2]. In the case of the MSSM, the lighter neutral scalar Higgs boson mass \(m_{h}\), calculated including next-to-leading-order radiative corrections, is constrained to be smaller than 140 GeV for \(m_{t}<190\) GeV [3]. With the additional assumption that the top-quark mass is equal to the infrared fixed-point value given by the renormalization group, \(m_{H}\) is constrained even further to \(m_{H}<120\) GeV [4].

Since the submission of the ATLAS Letter of Intent (LoI), the design of the LHC machine, and its parameters have evolved. In particular, the centre-of-mass energy has been reduced from 16 TeV to 14 TeV, and the peak design luminosity has decreased. Another factor, which has changed the assumptions used when evaluating the expected performance of the proposed detector, is the recent evidence for top-quark production at the Tevatron. Whereas a value \(m_{t}=140\) GeV had hitherto been assumed for the LoI, a value \(m_{t}=170\) GeV shall be used for throughout this note. The dependence of the results on \(m_{t}\) will be discussed wherever relevant.

If not explicitly stated otherwise, physics processes, including initial- and final-state radiation, hadronization, and decays, were simulated using PYTHIA 5.7 [5]. However, large uncertainties in signal and background production cross sections owing to higher-order corrections, structure function parametrizations, as well as the models used for full event generation, remain. In addition, despite the existence of many higher-order QCD correction (K-factor) calculations, such as those for gg \(\to\) H [6], \(q\bar{q}\to\) WH [7], or \(t\bar{t}\) production [8], not all processes of interest at the LHC (in particular background processes) have benefitted from this theory.

retical effort. Therefore, the present studies have consistently and conservatively avoided the use of K-factors, resorting to Born-level predictions for both signals and backgrounds.

The results presented in this note come predominantly from particle-level simulations. However most of the crucial detector-dependent performance figures, such as the mass resolutions, reconstruction/identification efficiencies and background rejections, were obtained using full simulations of the ATLAS detector, and used as inputs to the analysis of signal and background rates presented here.

This note was originally meant to cover both the SM Higgs sector and the MSSM Higgs sector. Since the submission of the ATLAS TP, much has changed however in the overall picture of the MSSM Higgs sector. In particular, more complete theoretical calculations are now available, and, more importantly, much more work was done in an attempt at performing a more systematic analysis of the MSSM Higgs sector. This includes a more or less automatic procedure to produce the contour curves in the (\(m_{\rm A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) plane and the analysis of channels not considered at the time of the TP (e.g. \({\rm H}\to{\rm hh}\), \({\rm A}\),\({\rm H}\to{\rm t}\overline{\rm t}\) and \({\rm A}\to{\rm Zh}\)). This part of the work is still ongoing and will be documented in a separate note in the near future.

As a consequence, this note will only cover the SM Higgs sector, including the most up-to-date results for the \({\rm H}\to\gamma\gamma\) and \({\rm H}\to{\rm Z}{\rm Z}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\) decays, in the mass range \(80<m_{\rm H}<~{}1000\) GeV. A postscript file for this note is available on WWW (on the physics/simulation page as SM-NOTE-048.ps). A draft of the note describing the work done in the MSSM Higgs sector before the TP is also available on the same page (as MSSM-NOTE-048.ps).

The last part of this note compares the expected ATLAS performances at 14 TeV and 10 TeV centre-of-mass-energy for an integrated luminosity of \(3\times 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The study is limited here to the SM \({\rm H}\to\gamma\gamma\) and \({\rm H}\to{\rm Z}{\rm Z}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\) decays, as well as to the more difficult \({\rm W}{\rm H}\), \({\rm t}\overline{\rm t}\)\({\rm H}\), with \({\rm H}\to{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) channels.

## 2 Standard Model Higgs boson

This chapter begins (section 2.1) with a discussion of the general features of SM Higgs production and decay for masses in the intermediate range, i.e. extending from a conservative estimate of the discovery limit at LEP2 of \(m_{\PH}\sim 80\) GeV up to \(m_{\PH}\sim 180\) GeV. This mass range can be explored through the combination of the \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) (section 2.2), the \(\PH\to\bbbar\) (see [9] for a recent detailed study of this channel) and the \(\PH\to\ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) (section 2.3) channels. Larger SM Higgs boson masses, between 180 GeV and 1000 GeV, are discussed in section 2.4 (\(H\to ZZ\to 4\ell\) channel) and section 2.5 (\(H\to WW\to\ell\nu jj\) and \(H\to ZZ\to\ell\ell jj\) channels).

Table 1 shows a few examples of important physics processes with their respective predicted cross sections as used at the time of the ATLAS Lo1 and as used for the TP.

The cross sections for SM Higgs production have decreased by \(\sim 30\%\). A decrease of \(\sim 15\%\) is due to the reduced centre-of-mass energy, while the additional decrease comes from the use of more recent structure function parametrizations. Most of the cross section values used for the Lo1 were calculated with the EHLQ parametrization [10], whereas values quoted in this section come from an average of various sets from the CTEQ [11] and MRSD [12] parametrizations. Branching ratios for the \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(\PH\to\ZZ^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) decay modes were obtained using the most recent theoretical calculations of [13] (see section 2.1).

The use of these new structure function parametrizations unfortunately has the effect of increasing certain background cross sections despite the decrease in the centre-of-mass energy. In particular, the cross section for the irreducible background to \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) decays, which arises from \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma\gamma\) and also from gg\(\to\gamma\gamma\), is now 40% higher than in the Lo1 in a mass bin close to 100 GeV. This increase is entirely due to a factor 2.2 increase in the \(q\bar{q}\) contribution, whereas the gg contribution has decreased by a factor 1.5. For much larger Higgs masses, \(m_{H}=1000\) GeV, the loss of signal cross section is larger, namely \(\sim 40\%\).

### SM Higgs boson with 80 \(<m_{H}<\) 200 GeV

This section discusses some general features of the production and decay of an intermediate mass Higgs, i.e. with 80 \(<\)\(m_{H}\)\(<\) 200 GeV. In the following, two sets of parameters are often compared:

* the one corresponding to the TP, namely \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV, \(m_{t}\) = 170 GeV and the CTEQ2L structure function parametrization (default of PYTHIA 5.7);
* the one corresponding to the LoI, namely \(\sqrt{s}\) = 16 TeV, \(m_{t}\) = 140 GeV and the EHLQ1 structure function parametrization (default of PYTHIA 5.6).

In a first step, the expected production cross sections, obtained from PYTHIA 5.7 for the various subprocesses selected for direct Higgs boson production (MSEL=16), are compared for the two sets of parameters: \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\)\(\rightarrow\) H (ISUB=3), \(\mathrm{g}\mathrm{g}\)\(\rightarrow\) H (ISUB=102), \(\mathrm{q}\mathrm{q}\)\(\rightarrow\) qqH through ZZ fusion (ISUB=123) and \(\mathrm{q}\mathrm{q}\)\(\rightarrow\) qqH through WW fusion (ISUB=124). Table 2 shows, for Higgs masses between 80 GeV and 200 GeV, the contributions to the Higgs production from the subprocesses listed above and the total production cross section \(\sigma_{tot}\) for the TP situation. Table 3 shows the same numbers for the LoI situation. The effect of the change of \(m_{t}\) on \(\sigma_{tot}\) was found to be small (\(\sim\) 3%) in this mass range (only the dominant gluon-gluon fusion contribution is affected). The net decrease of \(\sim\) 30% of \(\sigma_{tot}\), when going from the old to the new situation, is due about equally to the decrease of the centre-of-mass energy and to the change of the structure function parametrization.

The \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\)\(\rightarrow\) H subprocess (ISUB=3) is known to overestimate the cross-section by a large factor at small Higgs masses. For example, Table 2 shows that PYTHIA 5.7 estimates its contribution to be 5.34 pb for \(m_{H}\) = 80 GeV, with a 90% contribution from \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) fusion and the remaining 10% from \(\mathrm{c}\overline{\mathrm{c}}\) fusion. On the other hand, the more correct calculation, used to estimate \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) H and \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) H production [14] in PYTHIA 5.7, yields an estimated 1.1 pb cross-section for the \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) H contribution alone. The last column in Table 2, labelled \(\sigma_{tot}^{\epsilon}\), represents the best estimate of the total production cross-section for the chosen set of structure functions. This was obtained from the sum of all contributions in Table 2 except the \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\) fusion (\(\sigma_{qq}\)), to which were added the estimates obtained using \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) H production, corrected by a factor 1.1 to account for the contribution from \(\mathrm{c}\overline{\mathrm{c}}\) H.

These corrected values are used in the following as one of the ingredients to compute the expected rates for Higgs boson production and decay, but the values labelled \(\sigma_{tot}\) are used when comparing the PYTHIA 5.7 estimates for different choices of parameters.

Table 4 shows the influence of the choice of the structure function parametrization on \(\sigma_{tot}\). The first four sets of parametrizations reproduce more or less well present experimental results at Tevatron and HERA. The ones in the last two columns were frequently used at the time of the LoI but are considered obsolete today. It can be seen that the EHLQ1 parametrization gives values typically 15% higher than CTEQ2L, the present PYTHIA 5.7 default parametrization. For mostcases studied in the Higgs sector for the TP and throughout this note, we have taken the average of the first four sets shown in Table 4 for \(\sigma_{tot}\). In this mass range, the default CTEQ2L parametrization gives the lowest cross section and the total spread of the four sets around their average is \(\pm\) 5%.

Table 3: _Production cross-sections for the SM Higgs boson at a centre-of-mass energy of 16 TeV, for \(m_{t}\) = 140 GeV and the EHLQ1 structure functions._In order to estimate rates for the interesting final states, the Higgs decay branching ratios (BR) are also needed. In the Higgs mass range under consideration here, the dominant decay mode is \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\). Branching ratios to other decay modes are therefore quite small and Table 5 shows them for the \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}^{\star}\) decay modes, as obtained from PYTHIA 5.7 for \(m_{\mathrm{t}}=170\) GeV. The partial width of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) decay mode \(\Gamma_{Hbb}\) has been reevaluated recently [15]. From these recent calculations, one can estimate more accurately the rarer decay mode branching ratios. Results from RG-improved NLO calculations with mass-dependent contributions (as extracted from Fig. 4 in [13]) were used for this. The resulting \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) branching ratios are shown in Table 6 for two choices of the bare \(\mathrm{b}\)-quark mass \(m_{b}\). For the TP, \(m_{b}=5\) GeV was chosen to renormalize the PYTHIA 5.7 BR values of Table 5 to those of Table 6. Figure 1 shows \(\Gamma_{Hbb}/\Gamma_{Hbb}^{0}\) (\(\Gamma_{Hbb}^{0}=3\sqrt{2}/8\pi G_{F}m_{H}m_{b}^{2}\)) and \(\mathrm{BR}(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma)\) as a function of the Higgs mass, for the default version of PYTHIA 5.7 and for the recent calculations discussed above. PYTHIA 5.7 systematically underestimates the \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio (by up to 20%).

### \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) channel

#### 2.2.1 \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) signal

Tables 7 and 8 summarise the results presented in section 2.1, showing the expected \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) rates (cross section times branching ratio) as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\). Table 7 shows the expected rates as obtained using the PYTHIA 5.7 defaults (PYTHIA), the rates used for the TP (TP), and finally the best estimates (final) of these rates, based on the corrected total cross-sections shown in Table 2, on the average over the four sets of structure function parametrizations shown in Table 4, and on the BR values of Table 6. These final rates will be used throughout the rest of this section. The rates obtained using the PYTHIA 5.7 defaults are lower by 5% to 15% over the interesting mass region. This is mainly due to the difference in the BR values. Table 8 compares the values used for the LoI (see also [16]) and the final ones. The final rates are \(\sim 50\%\) lower than those used at the time of the LoI.

In the signal and background analysis, simple kinematics cuts, which optimise the significance of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) signal over the mass range \(80<m_{\mathrm{H}}<150\) GeV, were applied:

\(\bullet\) the photon candidates, ordered in \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\), were required to satisfy \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{1}>40\) GeV and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{2}>25\) GeV. Both photons were required to have \(|\eta|<2.5\). In addition, events with one or more photons in the vicinity of the electromagnetic calorimeter barrel/endcap transition, \(1.42<|\eta|<1.57\), were rejected 1.

Table 9 compares the acceptances obtained for signal events from the previous (16 TeV and EHLQ structure functions) and present (14 TeV and CTEQ2L structure functions) PYTHIA settings. Despite the differences in the centre-of-mass-energy and the structure function parametrizations, the acceptances are very similar in the two cases (for each mass point \(10^{4}\) events were generated), and are of the order of 40%, increasing slowly with \(m_{\rm H}\).

Table 9: _Acceptance of the selection criteria for the \(\rm H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay, for the situation of the LoI (16 TeV and EHLQ structure functions) and of the TP (14 TeV and CTEQ2L structure functions)._To estimate the expected \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) signal rates for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), additional detector-dependent inputs were used:

\(\bullet\) an average photon trigger/identification/reconstruction efficiency of 80%. This average value was obtained from a full simulation of \(\sim 2000\)\(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) signal events and \(10^{6}\) reducible jet background events in the ATLAS calorimeter and tracker. Each signal event was superimposed to 36 (on average) pile-up events, as expected at LHC design luminosity. The cuts were tuned as a function of \(|\eta|\) so as to obtain a photon efficiency as independent of \(|\eta|\) as possible. This efficiency drops, however, very fast near the transition region between barrel and endcap, which is one of the reasons for excluding events with a photon candidate in this region from the final sample. For \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=m_{\mathrm{Z}}\) (see Section 2.2.4), the overall photon efficiency is taken to be only 72% to account for the losses due to the rejection of the resonant \(Z\to ee\) background;

\(\bullet\) signal events were counted in mass bins of \(\sim\pm 1.4\sigma_{\mathrm{m}}\), slightly larger than in the LoI (see also [16]). The full simulation of \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) signal events for \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=100\) GeV has shown that the fraction of events in the chosen bin is typically 80%, after applying photon identification cuts, slightly lower than what would be expected from a perfect Gaussian (81.5%). This fraction is reduced to 75% after applying photon identification cuts, if photons in the transition region between barrel and endcap are not excluded. These numbers are higher than the ones used in the TP, where a value of 70% is quoted for all photon pairs with \(|\eta|<2.5\), and are substantiated by the most recent simulations, which use the best electromagnetic calorimeter geometry and include separate calibrations and cluster sizes for non-converted and converted photons.

Table 10 shows the overall acceptances, including the total event reconstruction efficiency of 64% (or of 52% = 64% \(\times\) 81% for \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=m_{\mathrm{Z}}\)), as a function of \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\), and gives the expected numbers of events, after accounting for the 80% acceptance in the chosen mass bin, for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The last column shows the numbers of events which will be used for estimating the observability of the signal, whereas the column before last shows for completeness the numbers of events which would be estimated using the PYTHIA defaults (see Table 7).

The total signal from \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) decays is somewhat larger than the values shown in Table 10 because of the additional contributions from \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) decays arising from associated Higgs boson production. Tables 11 (ZH production), 12 (WH production), and 13 (\(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) H production) show the corresponding expected cross-sections, acceptances and numbers of events. As in the case of Table 10, the overall acceptances include a total event reconstruction efficiency, which was estimated at particle level in terms of its dependence on event topology. The efficiency of the photon isolation cuts was found to be 75% for ZH and WH production and 69% for \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) H production, as compared to 80% for direct Higgs boson production. The significantly lower efficiency found for \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events is due the large jet multiplicity in these final states (a photon was considered isolated at particle level if in particular there was no reconstructed jet with \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}>15\) GeV within a cone of \(\Delta R=0.7\) around

Table 16 shows the influence of the structure function parametrizations on the summed Born+box differential cross-section \(d\sigma/dm_{\gamma\gamma}\). It can be seen that the EHLQ1 set gives \(\sim 40\%\) smaller cross-sections than CTEQ2L. The total spread of the first four sets around their average is \(\pm 30\%\), decreasing slowly with increasing \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\). There is good agreement between the two old sets (EHLQ1 and HMRSB), which was also the case in the LoI situation (\(\sqrt{s}=16\) TeV), as shown for completeness in Table 17.

Shown separately are the distributions for the Born (dotted) and box (dashed) subprocesses, as well as the summed distributions (solid line)._

in the final state pass the selection criteria. It has been demonstrated [16] that this contribution, if generated using PYTHIA 5.6 single photon production subprocesses: \(q\bar{q}\to g\gamma\) (ISUB=14), \(qg\to q\gamma\) (ISUB=29) and \(gg\to g\gamma\) (ISUB=115) with the second photon generated by initial or final state QED radiation in the parton shower approximation, is in good agreement with semi-analytical calculations [17]. It was also shown that this background amounts to about 50% of the combined Born+box contribution after the selection cuts (a fraction approximately independent of \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\)). The ratio \((\sigma_{gg+q\bar{q}\to\gamma\gamma}/\sigma_{gg-q\gamma})\), for \(\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$}}$}$}$}}}}}$}}$}>20\) GeV and \(70<m_{\gamma\gamma}\) or \(m_{q\gamma}<170\) GeV was found to be approximately the same for the TP situation as for the LoI. Therefore, as for the LoI, the bremsstrahlung contribution has been approximated as 50% of the combined Born+box contribution, but more detailed studies of this process are needed, in particular to evaluate more accurately its magnitude as a function of the isolation cuts and of the \(\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$ \mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$\mbox{$}}$}$}$}$}}}}}}$}}$}\)-balance cut.

The acceptances of these cuts are shown in Table 18 (TP situation) and Table 19 (LoI situation). The total acceptance is significantly lower in the TP situation, mainly because of a much lower acceptance for the Born contribution, which was shown to have increased substantially at low \(\rm p_{T}\) for the new structure function parametrizations. Therefore, despite the larger production cross-section for photon pair production in the TP situation, the irreducible background contribution is somewhat less than in the LoI situation (when comparing the TP and LoI rates, it should not be forgotten that the pseudorapidity cuts used in the TP are looser than those used for the LoI, so the numbers of background events in the mass bins are higher in the TP than in the LoI).

#### 2.2.3 Reducible backgrounds

In addition to the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) background, other potentially large background sources have to be considered. These include jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet events in which one or both jets are misidentified as photons, as well as \(Z\to ee\) decays where both electrons are mistaken as photons. Since the production cross-sections for these processes are many orders of magnitude larger than the signal cross-sections, excellent photon/jet and photon/electron discrimination is required.

Jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet events were generated using the standard subprocesses available in PYTHIA 5.7, i.e. \(\mathrm{ISUB}=11\), 12, 13, 53, 68 for jet-jet and \(\mathrm{ISUB}=14\), 29, 115 for \(\gamma\)-jet. Initial state radiation (\(\mathrm{ISR}\)) and final state radiation (\(\mathrm{FSR}\)) were included, as well as hadronization and unstable particle decays. Jets were reconstructed from calorimeter cells of granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\), where particle energies were stored after appropriate smearing. The jet energies were then collected in a cone of size \(\Delta R=0.4\). The same kinematic cuts as for the signal photons were applied to the reconstructed jets, i.e. \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{1}>40\) GeV, \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{2}>25\) GeV, \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{1}/(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{1}+\mathrm{p_{T}}^{2})<0.7\), \(|\eta|<2.5\) except for \(1.42<|\eta|<1.57\).

From the pairs of reconstructed jets which satisfy these cuts and have an invariant mass in the range from 70 GeV to 170 GeV, the ratios of the jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet cross-sections to the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) cross-section are estimated to be respectively \(2\times 10^{6}\) and \(10^{8}\). These ratios were computed using an overall efficiency of 80% per photon and of 77% per jet (see discussion in [9]). The latter accounts for the fraction of jets satisfying the kinematic cuts at the parton level which fail to satisfy them after reconstruction. There are large uncertainties on these ratios, and on the fraction of jets which are expected to satisfy the photon identification criteria, arising from

Results are from the default version of PYTHIA 5.7 and a single photon efficiency of 80% is included._higher order corrections, from uncertainties in jet fragmentation and from the detector simulation. Therefore it is necessary to reduce these backgrounds well below the level of the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum, which requires rejections of up to \(2\times 10^{7}\) against dijets and up to \(10^{4}\) against single jets.

The photon reconstruction efficiencies are 90% (dashed curve) and 80% (full curve). The default settings of PYTHIA 5.7 were used._

The jet rejection factors were obtained from a full simulation of high-statistics di-jet samples in the ATLAS inner detector and calorimeters. A more detailed description can be found in the TP and in [18]. Here we only recall the main results relevant to this note. With a set of calorimeter cuts (isolation, lateral and longitudinal shower shape), which reduce the jet sample to a sample predominantly consisting of isolated \(\pi^{0}\)'s, rejections of 1200 (2400) were obtained at \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\sim 20\) GeV (\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\sim 40\) GeV) for an isolated photon efficiency of 90% at LHC design luminosity. A further reduction of three of the surviving \(\pi^{0}\)'s was then achieved by using the preshower detector in combination with the tracker [19]. This procedure retains the large fraction of \(\sim 36\%\) of \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decays, which contain at least one photon converted in the tracker material, at the expense of an additional loss of 10% in the overall photon efficiency.

To estimate the invariant mass distribution for the residual jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet backgrounds after photon identification cuts, a linear interpolation of the single jet rejection factors, obtained from full simulation at 20 and 40 GeV, was used to scale the jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet cross-sections obtained after the kinematic cuts described above. The exact values used are given below for completeness:

\(\bullet\) without \(\pi^{0}\) rejection, i.e. without using preshower information, the jet rejection was taken to increase linearly from 1200 at \(\mathrm{p_{T}}=25\) GeV to 2400 at \(\mathrm{p_{T}}=40\) GeV and to saturate at a value of 5000. The photon identification efficiency was taken to be 90%.

\(\bullet\) with \(\pi^{0}\) rejection,, i.e. using preshower information, the jet rejection was taken to increase linearly from 3600 at \(\mathrm{p_{T}}=25\) GeV to 7200 at \(\mathrm{p_{T}}=40\) GeV and to saturate at a value of 10000. The photon identification efficiency was taken to be 80%.

The resulting ratios of the jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet backgrounds to the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum are shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that after \(\pi^{0}\) rejection, the residual jet-jet + \(\gamma\)-jet background is less than 20% of the total irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) background (Born + box + bremsstrahlung) over the mass range relevant to the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) search.

#### 2.2.4 \(Z\to ee\) background

For Higgs masses close to \(m_{\mathrm{Z}}\), the background from \(Z\to ee\) decays is potentially very dangerous. This background is resonant and produced with a cross-section roughly 25000 times larger than that of the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) signal. Therefore, a rejection of about 500 per electron is needed to reduce it to a level below 10% of the expected \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) signal. The desired electron veto efficiency can be reached with the ATLAS inner detector, as discussed in the TP, at the expense of additional inefficiency for photon identification, which is assumed from preliminary studies to be at the level of 10% at design luminosity.

\(Z\to ee\) (or \(\mu\mu\)) radiative production and decays have been studied in [20]. It has been shown that the mass distribution of \(\gamma\gamma\) or \(\gamma\)e pairs, which satisfy the kinematic cuts, is no longer resonant. If an electron veto efficiency of 99.8% and an overall photon efficiency of 72% are assumed, approximately equal contributions from \(\gamma\gamma\) (double radiative production/decay) and \(\gamma\)e pairs (single radiative production/decay and single external bremsstrahlung) are expected and these non-resonant backgrounds are well below 5% of the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum.

The background from pure Z\(\to\)ee decays, which consists of events in which both electrons are misidentified as photons, is therefore potentially more dangerous because resonant. An electron veto efficiency of 99.8% reduces it to the level of 10% of the H\(\to\gamma\gamma\) signal, as shown in Fig. 5, which was obtained by rescaling the results from [20] to the TP situation (\(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV and the CTEQ2L structure function parametrizations).

#### 2.2.5 Expected signal observability

The expected H\(\to\gamma\gamma\) significances, defined for each mass point as \(S/\sqrt{B}\), where \(S\) and \(B\) are the numbers of accepted signal and background events in the chosen mass bin, are given in Table 21 for an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The contributions from both the irreducible (Born + box + bremsstrahlung) and the reducible (jet-jet + \(\gamma\)-jet) backgrounds were accounted for in these estimates. The total expected signal rates, including all production processes discussed in Section 2.2.1, are used, whereas the values for the cross-sections times BR and acceptances are given for the dominant direct Higgs production subprocess. For the first few years of LHC operation at lower luminosities, the mass resolution is expected to be \(\sim 20\%\) better (much smaller pile-up and angular resolution effects), and the photon identification/reconstruction efficiency is expected to be rather 85% than 80%. The significances expected for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in the last line of Table 21. Several years of data taking at high luminosity will be needed to discover a Higgs boson of mass 80-100 GeV in the direct \(\mathbf{H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma}\) channel.

Figure 6 displays graphically, for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the expected sensitivity to \(\mathbf{H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma}\) decays as a function of \(m_{\mathbf{H}}\). The lower curve (full circles) corresponds to the TP results. The middle curve (open circles) shows the change to the sensitivity resulting from a more correct (b\(\overline{\mathbf{b}}\) H contribution) and more complete (associate production) treatment of inclusive Higgs boson production in this mass range. Finally, the top curve (open squares) shows the improvement obtained since the TP from full simulation of a more accurate model of the electromagnetic calorimeter, with separate treatment of non-converted and converted photons. A detailed comparison of the ATLAS and CMS discovery potential in this channel can be found in [21].

#### 2.2.6 Choice of optimal kinematic cuts

The optimal choice of kinematic cuts has been studied in detail as a function of \(m_{\PH}\). Tables 22 (resp. 23) show how the acceptance for the signal (resp. irreducible background) change as a function of the choice of \(\Pgt\)-threshold for the two photons. Table 24 gives the expected signal significances in each case. These values were obtained using the same rapidity and \(\Pgt\)-balance cuts as above. The last column of

Shown are the TP values (full circles), the TP values corrected for the best estimates of inclusive Higgs boson production (open circles), and the TP values also corrected for the most recent results from full simulation (open squares).

the Tables corresponds to the cuts used for the TP, which give the best significances for all values of \(m_{\PH}\). For \(m_{\PH}=80\) GeV, however, one should probably use looser cuts, which would not result in a significant loss of sensitivity, but which would reduce the bias on the \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution induced by the \(\Pgt\)-threshold cuts for low values of \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\).

Finally, Table 25 shows the \(\eta\)-dependence of the total \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) signal rates for \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=100\) GeV, of the irreducible background (Born and box) rates and of the total background (including the bremsstrahlung and residual reducible background contributions). The signal significances improve only slowly beyond \(|\eta|\sim 2.2\). The reducible background, which was assumed to vary in the same way as the irreducible one, is however expected to increase substantially at large values of \(\eta\) (close-by photon pairs from \(\pi^{0}\) decays).

#### 2.2.7 Outlook

Much work is still needed to establish the expected ATLAS performance for the \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) channel on more solid grounds. The contribution from quark bremsstrahlung has to be understood much better, both from a theoretical point of view and from the point of view of cut optimisation (\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)-balance and photon isolation). The \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation has to be studied with full track reconstruction over the whole \(\eta\)-range for converted photons, but also in terms of possible correlations between jet rejection and \(\pi^{0}\) rejection.

In addition, more exclusive channels, although much smaller in rate and worse in significance, may provide confirmation of a possible inclusive \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) signal with considerably better signal to background ratios. Higgs boson production in association with a high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) isolated lepton (see Section 11.2.5 of the ATLAS TP and references therein, as well as Section 12.1.4 of the CMS TP), or with several high-p hadronic jets (see Section 12.1.3 of the CMS TP), are promising such channels but need further study.

### \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{ZZ}^{(\star)}\to 4\ell\) channel

This mode provides a very clean signature for a SM Higgs boson in the mass range from \(\sim 130\) GeV to \(\sim 800\) GeV. For \(m_{\mathrm{H}}<2m_{\mathrm{Z}}\), the Higgs boson is narrow, the expected signal cross-sections are small, and the backgrounds are large.

Table 26, derived from the results presented in Section 2.1, shows the expected rates (\(\sigma\times BR\)) from the default version of PYTHIA (PYTHIA), those used for the TP (TP), and those obtained (final) after correcting the PYTHIA 5.7 production cross-sections, averaging over four sets of structure function parametrizations (CTEQ2L, CTEQ 2MS, CTEQ 2M and MRSD\({}^{-}\)) and using the branching ratio values of Table 6. The rates from the default version of PYTHIA are lower than the final ones by 10 to 25%, and, as for the case of \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) decays, the difference is mostly due to the branching ratios.

The dominant backgrounds to this channel are the irreducible \(\mathrm{ZZ}^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) and the reducible \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) and \(\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) processes. Table 27 shows the influence of the choice of the structure function parametrization on the total production cross-sections for these background processes. The default CTEQ 2L parametrization gives the lowest cross-section and the total spread of the four sets around their average is \(\pm\) 10%.

The \(\mathrm{ZZ}^{*}/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\ell\ell\) continuum has a small cross-section, but it is irreducible, since it has the same final state as the signal. It was studied using PYTHIA 5.7, which only accounts for the subprocess \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\to\mathrm{ZZ}^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) (ISUB=22). The other possible subprocess, \(\mathrm{gg}\to\mathrm{ZZ}^{*}/\gamma^{*}\), is expected to contribute at the level of \(\sim 30\%\) of the \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\) channel [22]. The irreducible continuum is dominated in the 4-electron channel by the contribution from virtual photons, \(\mathrm{Z}\gamma^{*}\), which can be greatly reduced by requiring that the dilepton mass corresponding to the \(\mathrm{Z}^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) be larger than a certain

Table 28 shows, for \(\mathrm{ZZ}^{*}/\gamma^{*}\,\to\,4\mathrm{e}\) events with \(120<\,m_{eeee}\,<180\) GeV and with a pair of electrons with invariant mass close to \(m_{\mathrm{\,Z}}\), \(85<\,m_{12}\,<97\) GeV, the expected rates for the total \(\mathrm{ZZ}^{*}/\gamma^{*}\) contribution (and also for the \(\mathrm{ZZ}^{*}\) contribution alone) as a function of the threshold on this dilepton mass \(m_{34}\). The significance of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{ZZ}^{(*)}\to 4\ell\) signal was found to be optimal for \(m_{34}\,>20\) GeV, a value for which the \(\mathrm{ZZ}^{*}\) contribution is still only 10% of the total continuum background.

A complete note on the expected signal and background rates will be published in the near future [23]. This note will include the impact of inner bremsstrahlung on the efficiency for reconstructing the invariant mass of the 4-lepton final states within the chosen mass window, and complete results from full simulation of combined isolation and impact parameter cuts. Some quantitative results can already be found in the note which compares the potential of ATLAS and CMS for this channel [24]. Since the TP submissions, CMS has corrected and improved their analysis in this channel [25].

All the rates are computed within a mass window of \(\pm\)\(2\sigma_{m}\) around \(m_{\rm H}\). The efficiency for reconstructing the four-lepton signal is 47% at low luminosity, corresponding to a reconstruction efficiency of 90% per lepton, an efficiency of 85% for the lepton isolation cuts, and an efficiency of 85% for the impact parameter cuts (this overall efficiency drops to 28% at high luminosity, due to the lower efficiency for the lepton isolation cuts). The reducible background from \(\ttbar\) and \(\ttbar\) has been brought down to a level well below the irreducible \(\tt ZZ^{*}\), \(\tt Z\gamma^{*}\) continuum.

The expected numbers of events and significances shown for an integrated luminosity of \(3\times 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) demonstrate that the signal from \(\rm H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) decays, for \(130<m_{\rm H}<180\) GeV, would be observable after a few years of running at low luminosity. The expected signal rate drops very rapidly for \(m_{\rm H}<130\) GeV and several years of running at high luminosity would be needed to observe a signal in this channel for \(m_{\rm H}\approx 120\) GeV.

The signal rates after cuts are however small, and the significances expressed as \(\rm S/\sqrt{B}\) are over-optimistic. These small signal rates demonstrate the need in this channel for efficient reconstruction of all multi-lepton final states.

### \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to 4\ell\) channel for \(m_{\mathrm{H}}>2m_{\mathrm{Z}}\)

#### 2.4.1 Signal rates

For \(180<m_{\mathrm{H}}<800\) GeV, the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to 4\ell\) decay mode is considered to be the most reliable channel for SM Higgs boson discovery at LHC, since the expected signal rates are large and the background small. The dominant background source in this mass range is continuum ZZ production. As \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\) increases, the Higgs width grows rapidly, and so do the momenta of the leptons to be detected.

The relevant production subprocesses are gg \(\mathrm{H}\) (\(\mathrm{ISUB}=102\)), qq \(\to\) qqH through ZZ fusion (\(\mathrm{ISUB}=123\)) and qq \(\to\) qqH through WW fusion (\(\mathrm{ISUB}=124\)). The narrow width approximation, which is used for these subprocesses in PYTHIA 5.7, is reasonably accurate for Higgs masses below \(\sim 400\) GeV. For masses between 400 and 700 GeV, this narrow width approximation gradually breaks down and does not accurately predict the Higgs line shape. Over this mass range, the value of \(m_{\mathrm{t}}\) influences the rate of the subprocess gg \(\to\) H (\(\mathrm{ISUB}=102\)), since the threshold for the top-quark loop contribution appears as a small bump in the cross-section situated at \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\sim 2m_{\mathrm{t}}\).

#### 2.4.2 Expected sensitivity to \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{ZZ}\to 4\ell\) signal

Continuum \(\mathrm{Z}(\gamma^{*})\mathrm{Z}(\gamma^{*})\to 4\ell\) production is the dominant background source in this mass range and its total production cross-section times branching ratio is 0.044 pb for \(\mathrm{m}_{ZZ}>200\) GeV. As mentioned in the previous section, this background can be generated in PYTHIA 5.7, only through the \(\mathrm{q}\overline{\mathrm{q}}\) subprocess (\(\mathrm{ISUB}=22\)). The total background rate was therefore multiplied by a factor 1.3, to account for the contribution from \(\mathrm{g}\mathrm{g}\to\mathrm{ZZ}\) production [22]. The lepton candidates (electrons or muons), ordered in \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\), were required to have \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{1,2}>20\) GeV and \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{3,4}>7\) GeV and to be within \(|\eta|<2.5\). The lepton reconstruction efficiency was assumed to be 90%.

Since the Higgs width changes rapidly over the mass range considered in this Section, a variable mass bin, \(\sigma_{m}=\sqrt{(\Gamma_{H}/2.36)^{2}+(0.02~{}m_{H})^{2}}\), was used to evaluate the sensitivity to the signal. A 95% acceptance for the signal was assumed for a mass bin \(m_{H}\pm 2\)\(\sigma_{m}\) (denoted as \(\Delta_{0.95}\)), and a 90% acceptance was assumed for a mass bin \(m_{H}\pm 1.64~{}\sigma_{m}\) (denoted as \(\Delta_{0.90}\)). Table 35 shows the expected rates and significances as a function of \(m_{H}\) after applying the cuts listed above.

Since the Z-bosons from Higgs decay are produced through 2-body decay of a heavy object, a significant rejection of the continuum ZZ background can be achieved, e.g. by requiring that the maximum transverse momentum of the two Z-bosons, \(\mathrm{p_{T}}_{max}(Z_{1},Z_{2})\), be larger than a given threshold. Table 36 shows that the sensitivity to the signal improves substantially for a moderate cut \(\mathrm{p_{T}}_{max}(Z_{1},Z_{2})>m_{\mathrm{H}}/3\). Table 37 shows that the sensitivity improves even further for a much tighter cut \(\mathrm{p_{T}}_{max}(Z_{1},Z_{2})>m_{\mathrm{H}}/2\). This cut however rejects a large fraction of the Higgs boson signal and its efficiency is subject to non-negligible theoretical uncertainties on the Z-boson \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)-distribution at large \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\). Finally Table 38 shows the Higgs boson width and the chosen mass bins, for a 90% efficiency, as well as the final expected signal sensitivities, which were obtained from Table 37 for all Higgs masses, except \(m_{\mathrm{H}}=200\), 700 and 800 GeV, for which the cuts of Table 36 were used.

### Heavy Higgs in semi-hadronic decay modes

This section briefly summarises the expected rates for the \(\PH\to\PW\to\ell\nu\jj\) and \(\PH\to\ZZ\to\ell\jj\) decay modes, in the case of a heavy Higgs boson with mass above 500 GeV. The branching ratio for \(\PH\to\PW\to\ell\nu\jj\) is about 150 times larger than that for the gold-plated \(\PH\to\ZZ\to 4\ell\) channel, thus providing the largest possible signal rate with at least one lepton in the final state to trigger the experiment. The \(\PH\to\ZZ\to\ell\jj\) decay mode, although potentially cleaner, suffers from a rate about 7 times smaller than that of the \(\PH\to\PW\to\ell\nu\jj\) decay mode.

The dominant production mechanisms for a large mass Higgs boson are gluon-gluon fusion and vector boson fusion. In this Section, only vector boson fusion, denoted as \(qq\to qqH\), is considered, since the reconstruction of the two final state quark jets (or tag jets) associated with this production mechanism provides a crucial additional signature for isolating the signal from the backgrounds.

Table 39 shows the expected production cross-sections for the \(ZZ\) fusion (\(\mathrm{ISUB}\)=5) and \(WW\) fusion (\(\mathrm{ISUB}\)=8) subprocesses, and also the total production cross-section, \(\sigma_{tot}\), used for the TP for Higgs boson masses between 500 and 1000 GeV. Table 40 shows that the \(H\to WW\) and \(H\to ZZ\) branching ratios are dominant and do not vary much over this mass range.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline \(m_{\PH}\) (GeV) & \(\Gamma_{tot}\) (GeV) & \(BR(H\to ZZ\)) & \(BR(H\to WW)\) \\ \hline \hline

Table 41 shows the influence of the choice of structure function parametrization on these cross-sections. The total spread of the four sets around their average is \(\pm\) 5%.

As discussed e.g. in [26], the \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\to\ell\nu\mathrm{jj}\) and \(\mathrm{H}\to\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\to\ell\ell\mathrm{jj}\) decay modes suffer from large backgrounds, dominantly from \(\mathrm{W}/\mathrm{Z}+\mathrm{j}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{a}\mathrm{d} \mathrm{t}\) production. The background from \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{W}\) and \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{Z}\) production adds only a small contribution to the total background. Table 42 shows the production cross-sections for the different background processes considered for the TP, and for four sets of structure function parametrizations.

#### 3.1.2 WH with \(\rm H\to b\overline{b}\) channel

For SM Higgs bosons with masses below the threshold for \(\rm H\to WW\) and \(\rm H\to ZZ\) decays, the branching ratio for \(\rm H\to b\overline{b}\) decays is close to 100%. Higgs production in association with a W boson or a \(\rm t\overline{t}\) pair is the most promising signal production process for a search for \(\rm H\to b\overline{b}\) decays. Leptonic decays of the W or \(\rm t\overline{t}\) provide an isolated lepton for triggering the experiment.

A recent study [9] describes the search for \(\ell b\overline{b}\) (WH) and \(\ell b\overline{b}\) (\(\rm t\overline{t}\) H) final states, with the goal of reconstructing a peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the \(\rm b\overline{b}\) pairs. The production cross-sections for the signal and the various backgrounds, including the \(\rm H\), \(\rm Z\to b\overline{b}\) and \(\rm W\to\ell\nu\) branching ratios, are shown in Table 45. The Wjj cross-section is quoted for parton transverse momenta above 15 GeV and angular separation greater than 30\({}^{\circ}\).

Tables 46, 47 and 48 compare the two centre-of-mass energies in terms of expected rates and significances, for \(m_{\rm H}=80\), 100 and 120 GeV and for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). It is assumed that a b-tagging efficiency of 50% with a rejection of 50 against light quark jets can be achieved (for more details about signal and background simulation see [9]).

The observability of the signal improves with decreasing \(m_{\rm H}\), since production cross-sections are larger at smaller values of \(m_{\rm H}\). Backgrounds from \(\rm Wb\overline{b}\), Wjj and Wjb are about a factor of 2 larger for \(m_{\rm H}=80\) GeV than for \(m_{\rm H}=120\) GeV. All these contributions vary smoothly as a function of \(m_{\rm b\overline{b}}\), except for the resonant WZ background, which can however be precisely calibrated using purely leptonic decays.

The signal rates and significances are very similar to those obtained for the WH channel; the main differences are that there is no resonant background but a much larger combinatorial background. The expected sensitivities at 10 TeV and 14 TeV for the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) H channel are compared in Tables 49 and 50, for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

#### 3.1.4 Combined results for 80 \(<m_{\mathrm{H}}<\) 120 GeV

The ATLAS potential in the search for a SM Higgs boson over the difficult mass range, \(80<m_{\mathrm{H}}<120\) GeV, is summarised in Tables 51 and 52 at the two respective centre-of-mass energies and for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The significances, always naively expressed as \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{B}}\), are shown separately for each channel, and also for all channels combined. Clearly, at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, an integrated luminosity about twice as large is needed as at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, in order to establish the evidence for a signal from SM Higgs boson decays if \(80<m_{\mathrm{H}}<120\) GeV.
