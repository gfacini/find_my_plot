## 1 Introduction

An iron toroid magnet concept has been developed in order to provide a conventional and low risk magnet within the framework of the ATLAS LHC collaboration. This report does not aim to present a complete engineering study, but rather a feasibility study of the overall construction methods and manufacturing possibilities.

Only established manufacturing processes, which are readily available within the European industry, have been considered in the design and the final design and construction assume the support of industrial engineering teams. The close link with industry is regarded as essential and references will be made whenever appropriate.

The limitations in road or rail transport to CERN defines the dimensions and weight of the individual pieces that can be pre-assembled outside CERN. Due to the large dimensions of the proposed magnet, the final assembly of the iron structure has to take place at the experimental zone, however, the aim is to reduce this assembly phase to a minimum. Furthermore, it is assumed that the total installation time for the magnet will be limited to not more than one year.

## 2 General description of the magnet

The general layout of the iron structure is based on an octogonal central "barrel" structure and two large mobile end structures as shown in Figures 0(a) and 0(b).

The length of the central part is chosen such as to correspond to the total length of the calorimeter section. This has the advantage that the end toroids become totally independent of the central part and the rail and roller system will not interfere with the active volume of the detector.

Figure 0(a): Basic layout of the iron structure

### Main mechanical parameters

The basic layout of the magnet leads to a structural division of the iron assembly in vertical sections, as indicated in Figure 1b. The total weight of the complete iron assembly, including the support structure, is 26400 t.

The proposed geometry results in a variable iron thickness. The straight line path length will vary between the nominal 2.5 m at 90deg to a maximum of 4.5 m at about the 45deg line. The path length variation as a function of rapidity is shown in Figure 2. The curve in Figure 2 does not include any air gaps between the plates. This is discussed in chapter 5.1.

Figure 1b: Structural division of the iron assembly

Figure 2: Path length in the iron as a function of rapidity (no air gaps).

### Main electrical parameters

From the iron characteristics (see chapter 4) and assuming an 1.8 T induction at the medium line of the barrel (45.4 m long), a total of 0.608 MAmpereturns, are required. This includes an estimated compensation (about 45%) for air-gaps between the iron plates, permeability degradation in the welded joints and a possible down grading of the magnetic quality of the iron.

This magnetisation in the barrel can be achieved by 4 coils, one in each quadrant. Each coil has 8 turns with a 19 kA circulating current.

For the end-caps, the outer part is identical to the barrel and the same coil arrangement can be used. The length of the medium line is 21.6 m (mean value for TF1 and TF2) and 0.304 MAmpereturns are necessary, or 4 coils with 4 turns each and a 19 kA circulating current, using the same compensation factor as for the barrel section.

A summary of the main parameters are shown in Table 2.

3. **The coil design**

The coil circuit is divided into 3 sub-circuits one for the barrel and one each for the moving end-toroids. The corresponding voltage values are; 2*30 V for TB and 2*33 V for each end-toroid (TF1+TF2+TF12+TF22). According to the CERN safety rules this would imply that the magnet can be considered as a low voltage installation. The coil will be mechanically protected in exposed areas and separated from the iron structure by a thin insulator.

\end{table}
Table 1: Iron core toroid electrical parameters.

A study [1] of the assembly procedure for the iron structure and the coils has shown that the best location of the coils are in a cut-outs in the iron, centred on the 45\({}^{\circ}\) symmetry axis. Figure 3 shows the details of this arrangement. Field calculations show that this coil position also results in the most favourable field homogeneity.

The coil is made out of standard Aluminium tube sections with an outer / inner diameter of \(Q\)= 140mm / 40mm. Because of the low stress situation, the basic material has a very low specific electrical resistance in the range of 29.0 to 29.8 n\(\Omega\)=m at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C.

The coil will be produced as prefabricated units in the surface building. The assembly of the tube sections will be made using a orbital welding machine. To provide the necessary space during the welding operation the coil-end are flared out as indicated in Figure 4.

Previous experience (manufacturing of the bus bars for the L3 experiment) has demonstrated the efficiency of the orbital welding method for large circular sections of high conductivity material. However, preliminary tests (at the supplier of the welding equipment) with the proposed cross section have demonstrated that the orbital welding speeds required, for the proposed diameter and the wall thickness, does not give a satisfactory result. Therefore, the conducting cross section will be reduced over a short length to obtain a more favourable diameter ratio, in order to allow an efficient use of this method. The excellent longitudinal

## 0.4 Magnetic field calculations

Measurements made on samples from the L3 magnet, standard Russian steel and on the Russian steel quality A-37 (envisaged for the SDC detector), show that the magnetisation properties of the steel will be of minor importance, since at the envisaged induction, a rather small spread in the permeability values can be expected.

## 5 Design, manufacturing and assembling

### Material selection

The basic plates thickness is defined by the normal standard of the producers and the maximum weight that can be handled in the production lines. According to present findings, the plates thickness should be limited to 100mm, giving a corresponding size restriction of 2500*5000 mm\({}^{2}\) for a maximum weight of 10t. A larger plate thickness would probably induced degradation of tolerances in the plate flatness. The same size restriction will apply for some of the envisaged welding procedures.

The flatness of the plates is important for the mechanical construction of the iron structure, but also for the effective iron thickness (or [Bdl]) seen by a particle track. Figure 8 gives the total air gap lengths for different air gap tolerances as a function of rapidity. Hot-rolled steel plates, corresponding to a 4 mm air gap flatness, could probably be produced. Better tolerances could only be achieved by machining the surface of the plates.

For convenience, the flatness tolerances and the corresponding airgaps are transformed into an effective iron filling factor. For an average air gap of 4 mm the filling factor is 96%.

The finishing quality of the plates will depend strongly on their origin. It seems, however, clear that some plate manufacturers have the capacity to deliver the plates as a finished product (strengthen, cut, sandblasted, protected with a primer and welded), without involving a second workshop stage.

Figure 8: Path length in air gaps for 100 mm platesFor other plate origins one must envisaged to perform additional machining operations (at the steel mill) in order to reach the required plates flatness.

### Welding options

A large amount of welding will be necessary to secure the stability and rigidity of the plates and blocks units. Several methods are being envisaged; submerged arc welding with addition of metal powder and narrow gap welding, which decreases the heat input because of the small joint volume. These two methods would most likely require welding operation in the horizontal plane with an important mechanical preparation of the welding joints and require a relatively large amount of manpower.

A more promising approach seems to be the Elektroslag welding, which is a mechanised welding procedure used in the vertical plane, requiring no special joint preparation. The advantages of this method are a high productivity, small shrinkage across joints and no alignment deformations for butt welds. The main disadvantage seems to be the relative lack of experience within industry.

An other interesting method is the Electron-beam welding procedure (which was used with success for the manufacturing of the L3 coil, 1100t of Al and more than 1300 joints). The use of this method for a low conducting material like iron would probably be easier than for a high conductive material. A rated welding gun power of about 20 KW at 50 keV should be sufficient. The main disadvantage is the need to pre-machine the welding joints.

Special welding institutes [3] have been contacted and a test model is in preparation for test welds with the Elektroslag method. These tests aim to measure the temperature distribution, permeability and resulting mechanical tolerances.

### Manufacturing outside CERN

Preliminary contacts with steel producers (in Sweden, Finland, Russia and Germany) have shown that it would be possible to prefabricate most of the iron structure outside CERN. The amount of preparation being limited only by the transport possibilities from the manufacturer to the CERN site. In our study we have limited the size of a transportable unit to not larger than 4.1 m x 15.0 m and a weight not exceeding 100 t (information received from an international transport firm [4], and national railway companies).

Using these conditions and the size limitations of the individual plates (see 5.1) a set of transportable plate geometries have been established, as shown in Figure 9.

In order to reduce the assembly work at CERN the basic plates will be welded together into larger units, as shown in Figure 10. Several different geometries are possible and the design is continuously evolving.

For the proposed design the number of individual plates to be prepared, and the number of plate-units after the welding operation, are indicated in Table 3.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline TYPE & TB & TF12+TF22 & TF1+TF2 & Total \\ \hline Individual plates & 2336 & 1216 & 1216 & 4768 \\ \hline Plate units after welding & 1022 & 532 & 456 & 2010 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Total number of plates and plate units.

Figure 9: Example of basic unit structure.

The handling of the iron plates for the cutting and welding operations is presently being studied [5] in order to reduce the total cost of the manufacturing and assembling.

### Manufacturing at CERN

At CERN the plate units will be assembled into "blocks". The maximum weight of the blocks will be limited 500 t.

The barrel cross section is divided into six blocks and a separate support structure. The end toroids are composed of an outer part, which is identical to the barrel section. The inner part is composed of six blocks. The symmetry of the arrangement limits the total number of different geometries to eight. Figure 11 shows an example of the block configuration.

Figure 10: Example of basic plate geometries

The surfaces of the end blocks will probably have to be machined in order to stay within the geometrical tolerances in the axial direction

The gap surfaces between the blocks must be machined in order to allow a maximum magnetic contact. The mechanical stability of the blocks will be obtained from bolts or from welding joints between the plates.

The block structure is designed such as to permit a convenient installation of the coil. The coil elements are completely prefabricated on the surface and installed in parallel with the blocks. Special "filler" plates make up for the difference in radial thickness.

Figure 12 shows the general layout of the manufacturing and assembly on the CERN site. In the first assembly hall, the iron sections (delivered by industry) will be welded together into blocks. In the second assembly hall the blocks will be machined and stored until final installation in the experimental area.

Figure 11: Iron block structure

The assembly of the toroid and the various detector units in conjunction with a limited total installation period (i.e. large storage area) will imply the construction of a rather large surface hall, 180 m long and 30 m wide. The visible height of the buildings can be limited to a maximum of 16 m by lowering the main assembly hall into the ground by about 8 m.

Part of this hall will be necessary at the beginning of the magnet construction, but most of the surface area is needed at least two years before the installation of the first detector elements. The part covering the access shaft will only be constructed once the civil engineering of the experimental area is completed. The hall is placed asymmetrically around the main installation shaft, therefore creating two distinct assembly regions. One side will be reserved for the assembly and construction of the magnet and the other side used by the various detector assemblies and the mobile platform for the calorimeter units.

Since a large part of the assembly hall is needed only during the construction and assembly stage, it would be possible to reduce the hall cost by splitting the hall into a smaller permanent construction over the access shaft and a larger temporary construction.

### Mechanical stress calculations

Despite the large weight of the magnet structure, calculations show a very moderate and controlled stress situation. The central barrel section will undergo a maximum movement (due to its own weight) of 0.15 mm. The maximum stress value in the magnetised part will not exceed 9 MPa.

The highest stress value will occur in the support for the end toroids. The calculated peak stress will not exceed 30 MPa. The shape of the support structure will depend of the choice of the muon detectors. The shown support geometry is not optimised to a specific detector design.

Figure 12: Layout of the final manufacturing and assembling on CERN site

### Movement of the end toroids.

It is essential that the end toroids can be easily moved away from the central part (see 6.5). Several different moving systems have been analysed [6], but at present a roller system displaced horizontally by a hydraulic push-pull-traction system, represents the most realistic approach. In between the rollers and the iron structure a system of hydraulic bearing pads will be installed in order to guarantee a vertical adjustment of the complete end toroid system. They also give the possibility to compensate for possible errors in assembly and deformations in the foundation. This system can be actively monitored such that each roller unit carries the same load and that the end toroids are correctly aligned after each movement.

A major concern is the dynamic behaviour of the end toroids during displacement. It will be necessary to build a scale model in order to fully understand the various constraints.

## 6 Installation in the experimental area

### Experimental area

The overall arrangement of the experimental area and installation scenario is mainly governed by the large dimensions and large weight of the proposed detector. It is assumed that all large detector elements will be partly or fully assembled in the surface area and lowered into the underground area in as large as possible units to limit the installation time in the cavern.

In particular, it is considered as a considerable advantage if the central part of the calorimeter could be lowered, as a complete and tested unit into to is final position. In this case a temporary crane of very large capacity (about 2500 t) would be installed over the main shaft. The calorimeter unit, which has been assembled on a concrete platform, is moved over the main shaft, such as to permit the temporary crane to lower the calorimeter into the experimental area.

Figure 13: Overall stress situation in TB sectionSeveral different geometries for the layout of the experimental area have been studied. The most cost-effective civil-engineering layout and the most suitable shape for a convenient and fast installation scenario, seems to be a single large access shaft geometry as shown in Figure 14.

The experimental hall is made up by a central access shaft, with a diameter of 33 m. At beam level, forward alcoves (diameter 26 m) provide space for withdrawing the end toroids and working space for the installation of the muon chambers. The total length of the cavern is 44 m. Each alcove has a smaller central alcove, to allow the very forward calorimeter detectors to be pushed into a garage position, underneath the low 8 magnets.

### Cranes

The surface assembly area will be equipped with a 2 x 250 t gantry crane, capable of moving the largest magnet modules. Two smaller cranes (60 - 70 t) will operate over the entire length of the assembly hall. In the early construction phase, when the hall is split into two parts, each area will be served by one of the smaller cranes.

Contact with crane producers [7, 8] show that the limitation of the largest subassembly to 500 t will still give a sufficient installation capacity without requesting non standard crane constructions.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:19]

### Alignment of the iron structure

Given the stringent requirements of precision and stability for the different detector parts and the overall size and complexity of the proposed detector, alignment considerations will play a major role already in the design of the magnet. In addition crustal movements of the experimental cavern can be expected.

The moving system for the end toroids already incorporate a vertical displacement possibility and in order to allow the complete iron structure to be aligned. It is also envisaged to place the barrel part of the toroid on hydraulic jacks.

### Access scenarios

An important factor in the magnet design have been to provide a fast access for maintenance and a general access scenario for repair or removal of all detector units.

The fast access possibility, which should give access to vital parts of the detector on the time scale of typically one day, can be achieved by withdrawing the end toroids by about 2 m to provide access to the calorimeter end-cap regions.

Figure 16: Isometric view of the complete iron structureThe general access scenario is based on a complete withdrawal of the end toroids by 7.75 m into the alcoves. This implies that the forward calorimeter detectors are displaced and that the low 8 units can partially overlap with the end toroids. Since the longest detector subassembly unit inside the inner cavity does not exceed 6.8 m, it is now possible to, by successive removal, reach and remove all parts of the detector.

Figure 18: General access position for the iron-core toroid

## 7 Safety considerations

Safety considerations play an essential role in the design. The manufacturing and installation of the iron structure does not present any particular safety hazard. The welding and assembly work in the experimental cavern have been reduced to a minimum. Due to the low operating voltage of the coils, the risk of electrocution has been considerably reduced. Similarly the confined magnetic field and the limited stray field contribute to a very assuring safety situation during operation.

## 8 Construction and installation schedule

A study has been made in order to estimate the total manufacturing time needed for the magnet on the basis of industrial production capacity and the proposed surface assembly arrangement. Following the installation scenario developed in chapter 6.3, an estimate has been made of the time needed to install the complete detector into the experimental cavern. Only the mechanical installation work has been considered, based on the proposed crane capacities. All aspects of running in, calibration and testing have been left out.

A period of 4 years will be needed for the production and pre-assembly of the iron structure, whereof 2 years in the surface zone assembly building. The installation into the experimental area is estimated to 8 months for the barrel part and 6 month for the two end caps.

## 9 Cost analysis

A preliminary cost estimated has been made using unit cost indications received from industry or costs based on previous experience, is presented in Annex 1.
