C.L.F. HOWCROFT

###### Abstract

Four \(n\)-in-\(n\) detectors were irradiated at KEK to a fluence of 3*10\({}^{\circ}\) protons cm\({}^{2}\). These were used to construct a thermal barrel module to 070 drawings with an -A3-90 baseboard at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. Thermal tests were conducted on the module, examining the runaway point and the temperatures across the silicon. The results obtained were used to calculate the runaway point under \(\Lambda\)TLS conditions. It was concluded that this module meets the specifications in the Technical Design Report, of 160 \(\mu\)W mm-(a) \({}^{\circ}\)C for runaway and less than 5 \({}^{\circ}\)C across the silicon. The module was also compared to a Finite Element Analysis, and showed a good agreement.

The modules in \(\Lambda\)TLAS SCT will be exposed to a high level of radiation, up to 3*10 [14] protons cm\({}^{2}\). This causes significant radiation damage to the silicon detectors.

The resulting leakage current in the detectors shows strong temperature dependence, of the form:

_Equation 1, the behavior of leakage current on temperature._

\[\mathbf{I}_{\text{\tiny leakage}}\propto\mathbf{T}^{2}\mathbf{e}^{-E_{\text{\tiny g}}/2\mathbf{ K}_{\text{\tiny g}}\mathbf{T}}\] [2]

Where T is the temperature on the silicon, K\({}_{\text{\tiny B}}\) is the Boltzmann constant and E\({}_{\text{\tiny g}}\) is the effective energy gap of the silicon, \(\sim\)1.23 eV.

The power dissipated in the silicon is the product of the bias voltage and leakage current. The power dissipation increases the temperature of the silicon causing further increase in the leakage current. This can result in thermal runaway, where the leakage current and temperatures on the silicon increase without bounds. Adequate cooling is therefore essential, [3].

It is important to understand the thermal behavior of the modules after irradiation by comparing measurements with Finite Element computer Analysis (FEAs). Previous investigations in to thermal runaway used external copper heaters to simulate the behavior of the irradiated detectors, [4].

The modules are expected to meet certain specifications, [5].

* The uniformity of the silicon temperature \(<\)-5\({}^{\circ}\)C.
* That runaway occurs at a power \(>\)80\(\upmu\)Wmm-2 at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C, with a factor of two safety.

Six n-in-n Hamamatsu silicon detectors were irradiated at KEK, to a fluence of 3*10 [14] protons/cm\({}^{2}\). That is approximately 1.5 times as much as they are expected to receive through out the life span of \(\Lambda\)TLAS. Four of these detectors were used in the construction of a thermal module at RAL. The module was built to 070 drawings, with an A3-90 baseboard, [9]. The construction method can be found at URL: [http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/atlasuk/sct](http://hepunx.rl.ac.uk/atlasuk/sct).

Two Thermofoil(tm) copper heaters were used to simulated the chips on the hybrid [7]. They were powered at 4.61 Watts (unless otherwise stated) by a bench supply.

The effects of the atmosphere and the coolant temperatures on the runaway point and the temperatures across the module were investigated.

_EXPERIMENTAL_METHOd_

The module was mounted horizontally on to a copper cooling block using two M1.6 screws and Dow Corning 340 thermal grease to ensure good thermal contact to the facings. The block was cooled by a chilled water/methanol mix for temperatures between 10\({}^{\circ}\)C and -5\({}^{\circ}\)C and Binary Ice for temperatures less than -5\({}^{\circ}\)C.

It was placed inside a glass bell jar so the atmosphere could be removed using an oil free. The enclosure also allowed runs at atmospheric pressure under nitrogen, the agreed ATLAS environment. The nitrogen reduced the risk of condensation forming on the detectors at low temperatures.

To monitor temperatures on the module, platinum resistance thermometers (Pt 100's) were glued on at various points using Boron Nitride loaded Araldite 2011. See Figure 2.

Previous investigations have shown the top left corner to be the first point to runaway, [4] and [10]. Pt's were placed here and on the other silicon corners. Pt numbers 3 and 12 were placed directly over the glue patch on the nose of the baseboard (see Figure 2 and [9]) to investigate the thermal path through this joint.

Pt's 4, 6 and 9 determined the temperature distribution across the hybrid. Previous studies have shown that the hottest point on the hybrid is between chips four and five. Pt 6 was placed at this point and Pt 7 below it on the silicon to investigate the thermal paths between the silicon and hybrid.

The air local temperature was monitored by Pt 16, situated 5 cm below the module.

The detectors were reverse biased in parallel, by two 150 V max. bench supplies. For n-in-n detectors the majority carriers are electrons and therefore the readout strips were positive with respect to the baseboard, [6].

A hardware current limit of 250 mAmps reduced the risk of damage to detectors during runaway of the leakage current. A hardware limit provides a faster response time than a software limit. All detector and hybrid supplies were floating.

The following circuit was used to determine the bias voltage and the leakage by monitoring the voltages, V1 and V2.

Where R\({}_{1}\)=1 M\(\Omega\), R\({}_{2}\)=1.005 k\(\Omega\) and R\({}_{3}\)=100.8 \(\Omega\) measured from the terminals of the box to an accuracy of \(\pm\)0.5% with a digital multimeter.

The V\({}_{1}\), V\({}_{B}\) and the Pts' read out channels exited the bell jar via a 40-way ribbon cable. Each cannel was selected one at a time by a Keithly 7001 Scanner, which was linked to a 199 DMM (Digital Multi-Meter). Read out was monitored and controlled via GPIB-Bus by a Macintosh running a LabVIEW\({}^{\copyright}\) VI (Virtual Instrument). The VI converted the resistances of the Pt 100s to temperatures, V\({}_{l}\) to leakage current and V\({}_{B}\) to bias voltage. These values were recorded to file for later analysis.

To take account of the resistance of the read out cables the first channel was shorted. The resistance of channel one was subtracted from subsequent Pts' resistances.

As expected the leakage current was light sensitive, a factor two difference between being in the laboratory lights and in the dark. This unknown variable was removed by covering the bell jar with two black cloth hoods and so cutting the light falling on the module down to a minimum.

A full schematic can be seen in Figure 4

\(\Lambda\) total of five runs were made. Runs were taken in one atmosphere of nitrogen (760\(\pm\)5 mm Hg) and in low-pressure nitrogen (3.5\(\pm\)0.5 mm Hg). The pressures were measured with respect to a vacuum.

The following Runs were taken:

\begin{tabular}{l|c|l|c} \hline Run & Coolant Temperature (\({}^{\circ}\)C) & Atmosphere & Hybrid Power/ (Watts) \\ \hline A & -5 & In Vacuum (3.5 mm Hg) & 4.61 \\ B & -5 & In Nitrogen (760 mm Hg) & 4.61 \\ C & -10 & In Vacuum ( 3.5 mm Hg) & 4.61 \\ D & -10 & In Nitrogen (760 mm Hg) & 4.61 \\ E & -5 & In Vacuum (3.5 mm Hg) & 0.00 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

A run was taken by increasing the power on the detectors in equal steps and allowing the temperatures on the module to stabilize. The temperature of each Pt 100 was found by averaging over the last six stable measurements taken.

Note that the "Coolant Temperature" quoted above is the temperature of the coolant in the chiller and not the top of the cooling pipe, Pt 15. There are losses in the pipes to the module of the order of a few degrees. The value of Pt 15 was recorded to file and used in analysis as the true coolant temperature.

An example of the raw data taken is shown in Figure 5.

\begin{tabular}{l} _Figure 5, A sample of the raw data taken on Run E, This shows the module temperatures following the coolant temperatures._ \\ \end{tabular}

Unfortunately, an electrical short from the detector to a Pt lead caused irreparable damage to the module. This means that no more runs could be taken with the present module.

## Power density

The leakage current in the detectors is temperature and voltage dependent. The behavior of leakage current with temperature is well known, Equation 1. To a good approximation, the current doubles for every 7\({}^{\circ}\)C increase in temperature. All data shown has been corrected to 0\({}^{\circ}\)C using:

_Equation 2, The correction of the system down to zero degrees Caliins._

_PowerDensity @ 0\({}^{0}\) C = W\({}_{T}\)_* 2\({}^{-T/7}\)

Where W\({}_{T}\) is the power density at temperature T.

There is a range of temperatures on the silicon. Therefore, a consistent average temperature must be used for T. Pt's 2,3,4,7,8,11,12 and 13 were used to calculate a mean temperature on the silicon. Pt 1 was excluded as it caused an overestimation of the average temperature as it was in the hottest corner of the silicon and Pt 5 was not available to balance the effect.

This average was then calculated for every bias voltage on each run and used to correct the power on the silicon down to 0\({}^{\circ}\)C. This removed the effects of the environment and coolant on the silicon temperature thus all runs should show the same voltage/power density at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C curves. See Figure 6.

To estimate the uncertainty due to the averaging procedure, the range of temperatures on the silicon was used to calculate a tolerance in the power density and are shown as error bars.

_Figure 6, The power density at Zero Degrees Caliins vs bias voltage._

A relationship between the power density at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C and the bias voltage can be obtained from a fit to the data:
_Equation 3, The Current-voltage behavior of the silicon detector._

\[PowerDensity@0^{\circ}C=A*V^{\alpha}\]

V is the bias voltage, \(\Lambda\) and \(\alpha\) were found from a fit to Figure 6.

\[A=(5.4\pm 0.3)*10^{-3}\]

\[\alpha=1.6\pm 0.1\]

Equation 3 was used to convert bias voltages to power density at \(0^{\circ}\)C.

If the semiconductor junction is assumed to be planner then the leakage current (at constant temperature) is proportional to the root of the bias voltage [6]. This gives a value for \(\alpha\) of 1.5. The \(\alpha\) determined experimentally above agrees with this theoretical value to within errors.

#### 3.2.1 \(\mathbf{I}\)-\(\mathbf{V}\) Cuvres

Current-Voltage (I-V) curves were plotted in Figure 7. The data was taken at varying temperatures on the silicon and can be corrected down to \(0^{\circ}\)C, Equation 2.

The value for \(\alpha\) was determined above. Equation 3 can be used to find an equivalent relationship for the leakage current at \(0^{\circ}\)C.

_Equation 4, The current-voltage behavior of the Silicon._

\[I_{\mathit{leakage}}=A*SiliconArea*V^{\alpha-1}\]

Curves representing Equation 4 and theoretical behavior [6] is shown overlaid on Figure 8.

_Figure 7, The Raw current-voltage curve._The thermal conductivity across the grease joint can be calculated from the temperatures of the coolant pipe, the top facing and the local environment. The thermal path between the top facing and the coolant pipe and between the top facing and the environment can be modeled by two thermal resistors in series see Figure 9.

Two sets of data are used. With the hybrids and the silicon cold, P=0 W, and with power dissipated in the hybrids only, P=4.61 W. This allows the values of R\({}_{1}\) and R\({}_{2}\) to be estimated for both high and low pressure nitrogen. The results are summarized in the table below.

Consider the module under ATLAS conditions. The temperature of the coolant at -15\({}^{\circ}\)C and the nitrogen environment floating at around -7\({}^{\circ}\)C. Then the AT across this grease joint can be calculated using this model and the resistivities obtained above.

If it is assumed that the total power dissipated is now 5 Watts then,

\[\Delta T=7.4^{o}C\]

\[T_{\mbox{\tiny facing}}=-7.6^{o}C\]

This is larger than the design value. The facing in contact with the coolant pipe was damaged during construction. The result was a poor thermal contact across the grease joint.

It was also noted that after being mounted to the coolant pipe for a few weeks the facings had started to come away from the baseboard. This further reduced the conductivity between the module and the coolant.

\(\mbox{\it TEMPER-ATURES ON THE MODULE}\).

The difference between the hottest point on the silicon and the coolest point on the module (always Pt 10, the top facing) was calculated and plotted against power density at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C, see Figure 10.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Coolant & Atmosphere & R\({}_{1}\) /\({}^{\circ}\)C W\({}^{-1}\) & R\({}_{2}\)/\({}^{\circ}\)C W\({}^{-1}\) \\ Temp./\({}^{\circ}\)C & & & \\ \hline -10 & Vacuum & 9.7\(\pm\)0.3 & 1.45\(\pm\)0.06 \\ -10 & Nitrogen & 4.9\(\pm\)0.4 & 1.46\(\pm\)0.20 \\ -5 & Vacuum & 11.3\(\pm\)0.7 & 1.63\(\pm\)0.20 \\ -5 & Nitrogen & 9.9\(\pm\)1.0 & 1.48\(\pm\)0.25 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 12 shows a plot of the temperature difference Pt 3- Pt 13, i.e. across the glue patch on the nose of the baseboard. See Figure1.1 for glue pattern. The dominant thermal path between the top and the bottom silicon is through the glue. As Figure 12 shows, the top and bottom of the silicon are extremely well coupled together, \(\Delta\)T\(<\)0.6\({}^{\circ}\)C.

_Figure 12, The temperature difference across the glue patch on the nose of the baseboard._

From the above plot, the top detector is a little warmer (order of 0.5\({}^{\circ}\)C) than the bottom. This difference is more pronounced when the same plot is made for the corners of the detectors. See Figure 13 as an example, \(\Delta\)T\(=\)Pt8-Pt13.

Figure 13, Temperature difference across the silicon in the top right corner of the module in figure 2.

The air gaps between the hybrids and the silicon can be considered as conductors. The heat transfer between through this gap was investigated. The temperature difference across this gap (Pt 6-Pt 7) was plotted. See Figure 15.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

The problem was separated into two temperature changes. Firstly the change in temperature on the top facing due the change in coolant temperature and the better thermal contact of the grease joint and secondly the change in environmental temperature. These changes in temperatures gives rise to two correction factors, from Equation 2.

This analysis predicts runaway between 190 and 760 \(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{\text{-2}}\)@ 0\({}^{\circ}\)C, see Appendix 1.

W. Murray's FE\(\lambda\) program [4] was used to simulate this thermal module (070 model and the two large heaters). The thermal conductivity of the grease joint was parameterized and then adjusted to give the same conductivity as the thermal module (table2). The results showed good agreement with the experimentally obtained data, see Figure 17. This plot also shows the thermal module lowered to \(\lambda\)TLAS conditions where it runs-away between 160\(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{\text{-2}}\)@ 0\({}^{\circ}\)C and 240 \(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{\text{-2}}\)@0\({}^{\circ}\)C. If the thermal conductivity of the grease joint is increased to that expected with intact facings then runaway increases to 240\(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{\text{-2}}\)@ 0\({}^{\circ}\)C. These are within the ATLAS limits.

## The effect of environment on the runaway point.

Consider dropping the environmental temperature. It is possible from the data obtained to estimate the effect this will have on the runaway point.

If the whole system was dropped by T degrees then the runaway point will move by a factor of \(\text{2}^{T/7}\).

However, the environment has not moved by T. If the environment is considered to be the bell jar walls then the temperature is constant. Alternatively, there is a slight change in the local air temperature, Pt 16. The effect of the environment can then be estimated by considering the difference between the value of runaway when the temperature of whole system is changes by T and that actually obtained.

If the local air temperature is considered to be the environment:

\(\lambda\) 1\({}^{\circ}\)C change gives rise to an 8.6\(\%\) change in runaway point.

If the temperature of the bell jar is considered to be the environment, then the absolute temperature does not need to be known as it can assumed to be constant.

\(\lambda\) 1\({}^{\circ}\)C change gives rise to 4.5\(\%\) difference in the runaway point.

\(DISCUSSION\)

The method of correcting down to a constant temperature was the dominate uncertainty in the experiment, see error bars on Figure 7 (\(\sim\)\(\pm\)15\(\%\) tolerance). The average of a selection of Pts was taken for each point. The Pt's were chosen to obtain an average as near as possible to the true mean on the silicon. They were arranged in diagonals across the detectors. The average is then used to correct the total power density to a specified temperature. However, there is a range of temperatures across the silicon. Therefore, each element of area on the silicon has a different temperature and hence a different power density. The relationship between current and temperature is non-linear. Therefore, each element should be individually corrected down to 0\({}^{\circ}\)C and then averaged over the silicon. However, it was assumed that the power in an element of silicon area was a linear function of temperature.

A more accurate analysis would require the temperatures on the silicon to be known in detail, for example using a thermal imagining camera.

Figure 6 shows agreement of all runs to within the uncertainties estimated. The value of \(\alpha\) found from a fit to Figure 6 can be used to find a best fit line for the current at constant temperature/bias voltage curve, Equation 4. Theoretical analysis of an infinite planner semiconductor junction gives a value of \(\alpha\)=1.5 [6]. Figure 8 gives the I-V curves at constant temperature. \(\Lambda\) line representing the theoretical value of \(\alpha\) was superimposed on the plot. This line shows poor agreement with the experimental data. There are two dominant systematic errors. Firstly, the uncertainty in the average temperature outlined above and secondly the assumption that the semiconductor junctions are infinite planes.

The bell jar walls were defined as the environment. The air round the silicon contains a feedback loop to the silicon. However, the temperature of the bell jar wall was not dependent on the temperature of the module. The temperature of the bell jar walls was not recorded to a high accuracy, \(\pm 5^{\circ}\)C.

The thermal resistivity of the grease joint is unaffected by the change in environment, the first two lines of the table 1 R\({}_{2}\) agree to within errors. However, the thermal resistivity of the paths to the environment is changed by a factor two by the increase in nitrogen pressure. Thermal conductivity of a gas is constant until very low pressures, around 1 mmHg[8]. Therefore, the difference in thermal resistivity must be due to a change in another heat transport mechanism effected by pressure, i.e. convection.

From the data in Table 2 alone it is not possible to make any firm statements about the temperature dependence of the thermal conductivity of the grease joint. The errors are too large and the number of points too small.

There were two main sources of systematic errors in R\({}_{1}\) and R\({}_{2}\).

1. The assumption that all the power from the hybrid enters the module trough the top facing, i.e. there is no direct thermal path between the environment and the hybrid.
2. That the local air temperature was used to calculate the values of R\({}_{1}\) and R\({}_{2}\) rather than the bell jar walls.

The first assumption is valid as the major heat path from the hybrid to the silicon is via the facings and not through the air gap, see Figure13. The dominant heat path from the module to the environment is via the silicon and not the hybrid as the surface area of the silicon is about five times that of the hybrid.

The order of the systematic errors introduced by the second point can be estimated by recalculating the values of R\({}_{\rm i}\) and R\({}_{\rm 2}\) using an estimate of the bell jar walls temperature instead of Pt 16. Systematic errors in R\({}_{\rm i}\)=\(\pm\)1%, in R\({}_{\rm 2}\)=\(\pm\)20%. The thermal conductivity of the grease joint is of the order of magnitude greater than that of the paths to the environment, see Table 2. Therefore, a small (a few degrees) change in the environmental temperature will not significantly change the heat flowing through it. This is reflected in the size of the systematic errors in R\({}_{\rm i}\) and R\({}_{\rm 2}\).

The environment is warmer than the silicon and so heat flows in to the silicon. It was noted that the higher-pressure atmosphere caused earlier runaway, Figure 10. Therefore, more heat is being supplied to the silicon in the higher-pressure atmosphere. The difference in thermal conductivity's between high and low pressure is negligible. Therefore, significant heat transfer via convection.

As the silicon warms up it becomes closer to the temperature of the environment. Therefore, there is a point where the temperature difference between silicon and environment is small and there is no net transfer of heat. At this point, the pressure of the atmosphere will have a minimal effect on the heat transfer. Therefore, the runs \(\Lambda\) and C converge just before runaway, see Figure 10. This is not seen on the runs at the lower coolant temperature as the silicon goes into runaway before such a point is reached. The solid line shows the temperature of the local atmosphere minus that of the coolest point on the module (for Run \(\Lambda\)).

The solid line does not cross the convergence point of \(\Lambda\) and B. The temperatures represented on the plot are the maximum temperatures on the silicon. Therefore, the rest of the silicon was at a lower temperature and that plotted. So there was still a net transfer of heat into the silicon.

There were differences in temperature between top and bottom detectors, Figure 13. These were caused by convection currents being set up inside the bell jar. The cooled module causes the air locally to sink and thus air warmed by the environment strikes the top surface increasing the temperature slightly. The convection currents are reduced in the lower pressure environment. Therefore, \(\Delta\)T is reduced.

_Figure 16, The convection currents inside the bell jar._

This temperature gradient could have a bimetallic effect, causing the module to flex in the plane of the detectors. This would place stress on the facings and might cause the separation from the baseboard.

There is substantial evidence of convection currents having a significant effect on the temperature of the silicon. In ATLAS convection currents might flow between the barrels of the SCT and could cause significant temperature differences around the barrels. \(\Lambda\) thermal simulation of a cross-section of two barrels would indicate the extent of this effect.

The gap between the hybrid and the silicon is 300 \(\upmu\)m thick. In such a small space no convection currents can be set up and, as already stated, the conduction coefficient is constant. This is supported by Figure 15. \(\Lambda\)t low powers then the \(\Delta\)T across the gap is the same for both low and high-pressure nitrogen. Lowering the coolant temperature has no effect on the \(\Delta\)T across this gap. This implies that small changes in the temperature of the environment do not have a significant effect on \(\Delta\)T.

The thermal module was constructed from irradiated detectors. However, the other components were not irradiated. It is still unknown how the whole module will behave after a heavy dose of irradiation in ATLAS. For example, the \(\Lambda\)raldite glue could be effected and so alter the temperature distribution across the module thus effecting runaway behavior.

It is believed that the damaged to the facings was caused by the pressure of the mounting bolts. The glue was not put directly around the mounting holes to reduce the risk of seepage into the hopes for the bolts. This means that the fragile facings are not well supported in this area and the pressure of the mounting bolts caused them to crack. From previous investigations [4], it was shown that the tightness of the mounting bolts could significantly effect the thermal conductivity of the grease joint. Further investigation into this joint is required.

\(\bar{F}\)**IN-\(\Delta\)\(\mathbf{CONCLUSIONS}\).**

1. Runaway was observed at 40-65 \(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{\circ}\)(0\({}^{\circ}\)C. However, taking in to account the difference in conditions between \(\Lambda\)TLAS and this module's conditions then runaway of the silicon can be predicted to be 190 + \(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{\circ}\)(0\({}^{\circ}\)C.
2. The \(\mathrm{F}\)EA and the thermal module agree to a good approximation.
3. The \(\mathrm{F}\)EA predicts the \(\Lambda\)TLAS modules to runaway between 240\(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{\circ}\) and 320\(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{\circ}\)(\(\bar{\mathit{a}}\)) 0\({}^{\circ}\)C.
4. The measured \(\Delta\)T on the silicon was to within \(\Lambda\)TLAS specifications, \(<\)5\({}^{\circ}\)C prior to the onset of runaway.
5. \(\Delta\)T between the silicon and the hybrids was \(\sim\)7\({}^{\circ}\)C. The dominant heat path was conduction via the hybrid legs.
6. Convection currents are very significant, particularly on the temperature of the silicon corners, though further investigation is required.
7. \(\Lambda\) 1\({}^{\circ}\)C change in the environment gives rise to a 4.5 % change in the power density at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C runaway point.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

If this module was to be put under atlas conditions and did not have cracked facings, then the effects of

1. The cooled environment.
2. The increased thermal conductivity across the glue joint.
3. The lower coolant temperature.

The effect of a and b above can be calculated, however including c requires us to know the effect of the environment compared to the coolant, i.e. the percentage of power that flows to the environment and that flowing towards the coolant.

The temperatures on the left are the conditions nearest to \(\Lambda\)TLAS achieved in this experiment. The temperature on the are the expected conditions in \(\Lambda\)TLAS, with the improved grease joint.

The change in temperature on the facing is 11 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

The change in temperature of the environment is 27\({}^{\circ}\)C.

Therefore we can estimate the change in runaway point due to each of the above as f the whole system moved by this amount.

=2\({}^{\pi_{1}/?}\)

Facings=2\({}^{1.57\dagger 4}\) = 2.97198

Environment=2\({}^{2\gamma/?}\) = 14.49

The delta T of the silicon will be somewhere in between these two values, it will however be waited towards the facings factor as can be seen by the differences in thermal resistively.

Runaway was originally at 56 \(\mu\)W mm\({}^{2}\), therefore it will now be some where between the values of:

_157-760 \(\mu\)W m m\({}^{2}\)_
Run C

Runaway at 45.86 \(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{2}\).

T\({}_{\rm{coolan}}\)=-3.2468\({}^{\circ}\) C\(\bar{\theta}\) Runaway

Local T\({}_{\rm{environment}}\)=17.9732\({}^{\circ}\) C

Run E

Runaway _@_ 53.24 \(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{2}\)

T\({}_{\rm{coolan}}\)=-6.1552 _@_ Runaway (2)

Local T\({}_{\rm{environment}}\)=16.5808\({}^{\circ}\) C

Therefore:

Delta T=2.9084 (3)

Correction Factor to runaway point if whole system was reduced by delta T= 2\({}^{\rm{{}^{h}}_{1}\)/=1.33375 (1)

Therefore:

Expected runaway = 61.1658 \(\upmu\)W mm\({}^{2}\).

Expected increase in runaway=33% From (1)

Actual Runaway increase =16% From (2)

Using the local Temp.

The whole system is moved therefore the expected Delta T =2.9084\({}^{\circ}\) C From (3)

Therefore Expected T\({}_{\rm{environment}}\)=T on run C -delta T

=15.0648\({}^{\circ}\) C

Therefore, the change in temperature that shifts from this expected T to the actual T seen in Run E

=1.516\({}^{\circ}\) C

This causes a shift in runaway =1-(53.24/61.1658)

=13%

\(f^{\circ}\) C makes 8.6 % difference to runaway.

If the environment is considered to be fixed.

The whole system is moved therefore the expected Delta T =2.9084\({}^{\circ}\) C From (3)

Therefore, temperature change required to move this back to the actual temperature seen in Run E.

= 2.9084\({}^{\circ}\) C

This causes a shift in runaway =1-(53.24/61.1658)

=13%

\(f^{\circ}\) C makes a 4.3% difference to runaway.
