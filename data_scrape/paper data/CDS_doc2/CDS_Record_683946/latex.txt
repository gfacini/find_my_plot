**Goals of the test**

The main goal of the performed test was to measure the radiation effects in the front-end parts of ABCD2T (with TrimDacs) chips and ABCD2NT chips (without TrimDacs) when irradiated with 24 GeV protons and with neutrons from the reactor. Another goal was to verify radiation resistance of the digital part of the ABCD2T/NT chip. Similar irradiation tests have been performed before for a single sided 12 cm strip module equipped with 6 previous prototypes ABCD2 chips. The front-end circuitry of the ABCD2 prototypes, in addition to some problems related with stability when connected to 12 cm strips, exhibited a high sensitivity on post-radiation effects in the basic devices, transistors and resistors. The changes and improvements implemented in the ABCD2T and ABCD2NT designs were expected to make these designs less sensitive to variation of the process parameters and on the post-radiation effects in the basic devices. A particularly important goal of the present test was to evaluate degradation of uniformity after irradiation for both designs, ABCD2T and ABCD2NT.

**Hybrid description**

We used for irradiation an SCT prototype barrel hybrid equipped with 6 chips, which was build as a part of the evaluation program of the ABCD readout chip. The support card providing supply voltages and signal buffering between the hybrid and the readout was build using standard no radiation resistant components. In order to avoid radiation damage of this card, which usually is connected directly to the module, it was mechanically separated from the module, protected against protons or neutrons and connected to the module via a 3 m long flat cable. This provided us with a proof that the ABCD2T/NT chip used in the MASTER mode can drive such a load due to the cable length while working with a nominal clock frequency of 40 MHz without degradation of performance.

**Procedure of proton irradiation**

The hybrid was irradiated in the 24 GeV proton beam from the PS accelerator at CERN. During the irradiation, which took about one week, the hybrid received a total fluence of about 3\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) p/cm\({}^{2}\). The hybrid was kept in the cooled box filled with nitrogen at temperature of about 2\({}^{\circ}\)C. Temperature of the hybrid itself measured during operation was about 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C. During irradiation the chips were clocked and read out. All basic analogue parameters of the chips were measured every day. For the measurements the hybrid was removed from the beam to reduce the background from the traversing protons, but remained in the irradiation area. The data was taken via the long cables in the same configuration as during irradiation.

After fluence of 1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) p/cm\({}^{2}\) the ABCD2NT chips in response to calibration signals started to send only zero values. The origin of the problem has not been clarified yet, but most likely the front-end circuits were not biased correctly due to drifts of the device parameters. Fortunately the ATLAS SCT base line chips equipped with TrimDacs show sufficient radiation resistance and stay operational until reaching the full fluence of 3\(\times\)10\({}^{44}\) p/cm\({}^{2}\).

**Results for ABCD2T chips proton irradiation**

During every measurement a set of threshold scans was taken for various values of the preamplifier current (from I\({}_{\text{preamp}}\)=147.2 \(\mu\)A up to I\({}_{\text{preamp}}\)=257.6 \(\mu\)A) and of injected charge (from 1.5 fC to 2.0 fC). The shaper current was varied between I\({}_{\text{dapre}}\)=24 \(\mu\)A and I\({}_{\text{dapre}}\)=31.2 \(\mu\)A. This allows estimating the gain and the noise as a function of the preamplifier and shaper bias currents. No significant temperature effect was noticed when cooling the hybrid from the room temperature to 2 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The chips work properly over a wide range of the preamplifier current and the shaper current at room temperature as well as at low temperature as foreseen in the experiment.

The mean value (50% point) and the noise were extracted for each channel and each operating point from a fit of S-curve to the threshold scan for a given calibration signal. From a linear fit to three points corresponding to the charges of 1.5 fC, 1.75 fC and 2.0 fC the gain of every channel was obtained. The ENC was calculated using the measured noise at 1.75 fC. All three ABCD2T chips behaved quite consistently during irradiation, therefore below we present the results for one chip.

Figure 1 shows the dependence of the gain on the preamplifier current for a constant value of the shaper current before and after the irradiation. While increasing the shaper bias from 19 \(\mu\)A to 36 \(\mu\)A the gain increases from 45 mV/fC to about 62 mV/fC. The chip works properly over the whole range of the preamplifier and shaper current, therefore for the further analysis the working point I\({}_{\text{pream}}\)=202.4 \(\mu\)A and I\({}_{\text{dapre}}\)=31.2 \(\mu\)A is chosen.

One of the most critical issues for the binary readout is the uniformity of the threshold. The first ABCD prototype did not meet the SCT requirement with respect to that parameter and necessary improvements have been implemented in the ABCD2T version. The most important improvement is the implementation of TrimDacs, which enables the threshold correction on channel by channel basis. However, a question how the threshold uniformity can be degraded after irradiation remains as an open issue. Given the fact that the spread of gain in the ABCD2T/NT chip is relatively small, the spread of the 50% points corresponds basically to the spread of the discriminator offset.

The spread of 50% points obtained from fitting S-curves taken by 1.75 fC injected charge is shown in figure 2. The plots show the distribution of the means before and after irradiation. The spread is increased by a factor of about 3, from about 12.5 mV rms up to 42 mV rms. Due to a good linearity of TrimDacs the spread of 50% points can be efficiently reduced down to about 3 mV rms, which is shown in the third plot. Only few channels could not be corrected, which was an effect of the limited range of TrimDacs. As shown in the fourth plot in figure 3 the spread of the 50% points

increases quite rapidly at the beginning of the irradiation, up to of about 1\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\) p/cm\({}^{2}\), and than is stable over the rest of the irradiation period.

The characteristics of the TrimDacs before and after irradiation are compared in fig. 3, which shows separately for every channel the 50% points for an 1.75 fC injected charge as a function of the setting of 16 values of the TrimDac. One can notice a significant improvement of linearity of the TrimDac characteristics after irradiation. This effect was expected as a result of degradation of the current gain factor \(\beta\) in bipolar transistors. It confirms also, that our diagnosis concerning the problems with the spread and nonlinearity of the TrimDac characteristics is correct.

Figure 2: Distribution of 50% points before (left upper plot) and after irradiation (right upper plot). The spread of 50% points is highly reduced by using TrimDacs (left lower plot). The evolution of the spread as a function of irradiation dose is shown in right lower plot.

The gain remains relatively stable during the whole irradiation period, it changes by less than 10% from 68 mV/fC down to 62 mV/fC. It is worth to note that the drift of gain would be easily corrected by adjusting the shaper current. Also the gain spread remains unchanged at the level of 2 mV/fC, showing the good gain uniformity over the whole chip (figure 4).

In figure 5 the ENC noise distributions before and after irradiation are plotted. After irradiation the increased threshold spread is corrected using TrimDacs. The increase of ENC noise from about 450 electrons up to about 590 electrons after irradiation is clearly visible, but this is an expected effect due to the degradation of \(\beta\) of the input transistor resulting in respectively higher base current and so higher shot noise generated by this current.

Results for ABCD2NT chips proton irradiation

As mentioned before we have collected data for the ABCD2NT chips only up to the fluence of 1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)  p/cm\({}^{2}\). The ABCD2NT chips (not equipped with TrimDacs) show also a significant threshold spread after the initial irradiation phase (see figure 6 and 7). However, in that case the offsets can not be corrected and the threshold spread after irradiation becomes significantly worse, compared to the specified requirement. Also the gain spread increases (see figure 8), which was not observed in the case of ABCD2T chips. The mean gain value of all channels in the chip increases slightly. Thus, although in the moment we have data for the ABCD2NT chips only up to the fluence of 1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)  p/cm\({}^{2}\), the degradation of matching is significant and a comparison between the two options indicates clearly for the ABCD2T as a preferential choice.

**Neutron irradiation procedure**

The setup used for neutron irradiation in Ljubljana reactor was similar to the one used at PS at CERN. The hybrid was connected to 2.5 m long low mass tapes for power lines and twisted pair cables for signals. These lines are extended by 3.5 m long twisted pair cable and later connected to the LVDS repeater card. The long cables are needed to put the hybrid into the reactor core and to protect the support card from the radiation damage by keeping it outside. The low mass tapes were used, since they cool down quickly after irradiation.

Figure 7: Evolution of a spread of 50% points as a function of a proton fluence.

The fluence was calculated by the irradiation time in the reactor core and the power of the reactor. All neutron fluences quoted are expressed in 1 MeV NIEL equivalent (i.e. 1 MeV NIEL equivalent fluence of 1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) corresponds to 1.1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) fast neutrons with energy greater than 100 keV, same number of epithermal neutrons and twice as many thermal neutrons E\(<\)0.5 eV) and are accurate to about 10%. During irradiation the air temperature around hybrid was about 20\({}^{\circ}\)C, since no active cooling was applied, one can expect that the chip temperature was about 40 C or higher. The chips were clocked and readout. Chip performance was tested up to a fluence of 2\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\). The ABCD2NT chips were operational up to the fluence of 5\(\times\)10\({}^{13}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\), while ABCD2T were operational until the end of irradiation. The results obtained for ABCD2NT chips were consistent with the performance of the chips observed during proton irradiation.

**Results of ABCD2T chips neutron irradiation**

The fluence received by the chips was increased in four steps: first to 0.2\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\), then 0.6\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\), 1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) and 2\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\). After each irradiation step a set of measurements, same as in during the proton irradiation, was taken. Figure 9 shows the gain distribution before and after irradiation. The gain decreases of about 35%, while the gain spread increases nearly three times.

**Figure 9 Gain distribution for ABCD2T chip before (left upper plot) and after (left lower plot) the irradiation with neutrons (I\({}_{\text{premo}}\)=147.2 uA, I\({}_{\text{hapcr}}\)=31.2 uA). The right plot shows the gain evolution with the neutron fluence.**After neutron irradiation up to 2\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) the noise increases significantly. The increase of noise is much higher compared to the increase after proton irradiation. This indicates for a significant degradation of the current gain factor \(\beta\) in the input transistor, much higher compared to the effect observed after parton irradiation. The detailed studies show, that the gain degradation is slower at the beginning of the irradiation, and the main gain drop happened during irradiation between 1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) and 2\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\).

Figure 11 shows the TrimDacs characteristics before and after irradiation. Similar improvement as in case of proton irradiation of their characteristics is observed due to the degradation of \(\beta\) of the input transistor.

The good linearity of the TrimDacs enables the compensation of the increased offset spread after irradiation. The distribution of 50% points from S-curves before and after the irradiation is shown in figure 12. After irradiation the mean of the distribution is shifted to the lower values due to the gain decrease and the width of the distribution is increased. However, due to the improved performance of the TrimDacs after irradiation, the increased spread of 50% points can be efficiently compensated.

The overall performance degradation after neutron irradiation is similar to the one observed after irradiation with protons. According to [1] a conversion factor of 0.51 between 24 GeV proton fluence and 1 MeV fluence should be applied. Therefore the neutron irradiation with a fluence of 2\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)  n/cm\({}^{2}\) corresponds to a proton fluence of 4\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)  p/cm\({}^{2}\) and one can expect that the overall radiation damage after the neutron irradiation should be greater than after using 24 GeV protons (fluence of 3\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)  p/cm\({}^{2}\)).

## Conclusions

After irradiation all chips equipped with TrimDacs stay fully operational, which shows the radiation hardness of the digital part. The front-end performance degrades during irradiation as expected. The gain decreases by about 10%, and the ENC noise increases by about 30% after irradiation with 3\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)  p/cm\({}^{2}\) protons. The higher gain degradation of about 35% and noise increase of about 80% was observed after the neutron fluence of 2\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)  n/cm\({}^{2}\), which is equivalent to a proton fluence of 4\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)  p/cm\({}^{2}\). The increased threshold spread is efficiently corrected using TrimDacs. This shows usefulness and the necessity of the solution using TrimDacs as implemented in the ABCD2T design.
