Introduction

A good understanding of the Standard Model (SM) predictions for photon production is important in searches for new phenomena.

Prompt photon production at large transverse momenta in high energy processes at hadron colliders can be predicted within the framework of perturbative QCD. The photon can be produced either via hard, direct radiation from a primary quark or anti-quark, or via fragmentation of a hadronic jet to produce an energetic photon. The process is sensitive to the gluon content of the proton through the Compton-like process \(qg\to q\gamma\), which dominates the prompt photon production cross section at the LHC [1], and can be used to constrain the gluon parton distribution function (PDF). The gluon distribution plays an important role in theoretical calculations of most important production processes at the LHC due to the dominance of subprocesses with gluons in the initial state. Therefore, a precise knowledge of the gluon PDF is vital for precise cross section predictions for both signal and background processes at the LHC.

Prompt photon production data has been used to constrain the gluon distribution [2, 3, 4]. Recently [5] there has been progress in the understanding of the predictions for the prompt photon process and a study has been performed [6] using higher energy collider data on inclusive photons to constrain the gluon PDF. The present study assesses the compatibility of recent ATLAS data on prompt photon data [7] with NLO QCD predictions using various current PDFs.

## 2 Experimental Measurement

The recent ATLAS inclusive photon analysis [7] measured the transverse energy (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\) ) and pseudorapidity 1 (\(\eta^{\gamma}\)) cross sections in 2011 data. The analysis was performed in the kinematic region, \(100\GeV<E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}<1\TeV\), within \(|\eta^{\gamma}|<1.37\) (central), and \(1.52<|\eta^{\gamma}|<2.37\) (forward). The range of the measurement in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\) enables the PDF to be probed over the range of Bjorken \(x\), \(0.03<x<0.3\), where \(x\sim 2E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}/\sqrt{s}\). The photon is required to be isolated with respect to significant hadronic activity: the transverse energy within a cone of radius 0.4 in \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) space around the photon must be lower than 7. The analysis uses data-driven techniques to subtract the background and then the signal yield is divided by a bin-by-bin correction factor to extract the cross section.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector, and the \(z\)-axis along the beam line. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam line. Observables labeled “transverse” are projected into the \(x\)–\(y\) plane. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

### Experimental Uncertainties

The precision of PDFs obtained from a QCD fit relies on the experimental precision of the measurements. The impact of new measurements on PDFs can be evaluated using QCD predictions and the full information for the experimental uncertainties. Along with the statistical and luminosity [8] uncertainties there are additional systematic uncertainties whose effects are correlated between different bins in the differential \(\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\) cross section. These consist of:

* The systematic uncertainty from changing the photon energy scale offset. This is the largest uncertainty and is treated as correlated bin-to-bin in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\) but as uncorrelated between the central and forward rapidity regions.

* The impact of the differences in photon isolation between truth and reconstruction in the MC.
* The uncertainty on the photon identification efficiency, obtained by calculating the efficiency using different techniques [9], which also accounts for uncertainties on the amount of material upstream of the calorimeter.
* The uncertainty on the estimation of the subtracted background.
* The effect of altering the non-isolated selection for the background subtraction calculation.
* The impact of fragmentation on the bin-by-bin correction factor.

Two additional uncertainties are considered, the effects of which are treated as uncorrelated between bins:

* The uncertainty on the photon energy resolution.
* The uncertainty arising from the difference in the choice of MC generators, Herwig[10] compared to Pythia[11], in evaluating the bin-by-bin correction factor.

All the experimental uncertainties were symmetrised taking half the interval between the maximum and minimum value for each source.

## 3 Theoretical Predictions

This note compares the cross section for inclusive prompt photon production discussed in the previous section with the predictions of perturbative QCD which are available up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in the string coupling, \(\alpha_{S}\).

This study uses both the JetPhox[12, 5, 13] and MCFM[14, 15] calculations. In JetPhox the cross section for inclusive photon production is calculated at NLO and includes photon fragmentation processes to NLO accuracy. The MCFM calculation evaluates the direct photon subprocess at NLO, but only includes the fragmentation contribution at leading order (LO). Unlike JetPhox, MCFM can be linked to software to allow PDF fits to be performed. The need to integrate numerically over the final state phase space means that fast grids, such as APPLGRID[16], are required in the QCD fit procedure to evaluate the cross section quickly for each iteration of the fit. This note compares the results from MCFM and JetPhox with each other, and with the data with a view to establish the validity of using MCFM in such a fit where JetPhox is impractical.

For this note, both the JetPhox and MCFM calculations are performed with dynamic renormalisation and factorisation scales set to \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\). For the JetPhox calculation, the fragmentation scale was also set to \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\). The electromagnetic coupling is treated differently in each calculation: in JetPhox, \(\alpha_{\mathrm{EM}}\) is set to 1/137 whereas in MCFM it is set to 1/132. To account for this, a rescaling factor of 132/137 has been applied to the predictions from MCFM.

To establish compatibility of the JetPhox and MCFM calculations a direct comparison of the two calculations is made without including fragmentation, since the calculations evaluate the fragmentation contribution at different orders. In JetPhox the direct and fragmentation components can be calculated independently, but still using the same cone isolation used for the experimental measurement in which the sum of the parton energy within a cone of radius 0.4 about the photon direction must be less than 7 GeV. In MCFM the fragmentation component is removed by applying a Frixione style isolation cut[17]. This also takes place within a cone of radius 0.4, consistent with the cone isolation used in the measurement.

In this study however, the MCFM source code was modified to apply a constant 7 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) isolation cut, rather than a cut on the MCFM default fraction \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{h}}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\). This procedure was adopted to match closely the cone algorithm used experimentally, while still removing the fragmentation contribution. The effects of fragmentation at NLO for MCFM are simulated by applying to the MCFM calculation a k-factor, \(\mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{frag}}\), obtained using JetPbox:

\[\mathrm{k}_{\mathrm{frag}}=\sigma_{\mathrm{total}}/\sigma_{\mathrm{direct}},\]

where \(\sigma_{\mathrm{total}}\) is the total cross section including fragmentation and \(\sigma_{\mathrm{direct}}\) is the direct contribution without fragmentation. The k-factors calculated using JetPbox with the CT10 [18], MSTW2008 [19], ABM11_5N [20] HERAPDF1.5 [21] and NNPDF2.3 [22] PDF sets are shown in Figure 1. There is no significant dependence of the k-factors on the parton distribution. The k-factors also show that for centrally produced photons in the region \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}>500\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), the contribution of quark fragmentation into photons is expected to be at the sub-percent level.

The cross section from MCFM without fragmentation agrees to within 2% of the direct contribution from JetPbox for \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}<600\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) in the central rapidity region. This is illustrated in Figure 2. Above 600 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) the normalisation of MCFM and JetPbox do not agree. This may be related to the use of the Frixione isolation in MCFM. However, the sensitivity to the PDFs is not greatly affected by this difference as the experimental uncertainties are large in this region.

### Partonic contributions to the inclusive photon cross section

Figure 3 shows the contribution to the cross sections discussed in Section 2 from different initial state parton-parton subprocesses calculated using the CT10 and ABM11_5N PDF sets. This shows clearly that the \(u\)-\(g\) process dominates, due both to the larger charge of \(u\)-type quarks, and their prevalence in the proton. This contribution reduces slightly at higher \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\) where \(q\)-\(q\) contributions increase. The ABM11_5N PDF has a softer gluon distribution at high-\(x\) such that the contribution from processes with incident gluons in the initial state is smaller at high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\) than that obtained using CT10. The gluon distributions for each PDF set, evaluated at the scale \(Q^{2}=2\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}^{2}\), are compared in Figure 4. The CT10, MSTW2008 and NNPDF2.3 sets have compatible gluon PDFs throughout the full \(x\) range. The HERAPDF1.5 deviates for \(x>0.2\), and ABM11_5N shows deviations both at low \(x\) and large \(x\).

Figure 1: The fragmentation k-factors calculated for different PDFs at NLO with JetPbox in the (a) central and (b) forward regions.

The large contribution from quark-gluon induced processes, for both of these rather different PDFs, suggests that the inclusive photon production cross section can provide significant constraints on the gluon distribution with respect to current predictions.

### Theoretical uncertainties

The renomalisation and factorisation scale uncertainties were estimated by varying both scales independently by factors of 2 and 0.5. The overall scale uncertainty was estimated by taking the envelope of the resulting distributions. The PDF uncertainty was evaluated using the PDF eigenvectors from each set according to the prescription from each PDF group. The uncertainty in the cross section arising from the strong coupling uncertainty was evaluated using special PDF sets fitted with \(\alpha_{S}\) (\(M_{Z}\)) shifted up and down by 0.002 from the default value. The total theoretical uncertainty was calculated by adding the scale uncertainty, the PDF uncertainty and the uncertainty on the strong coupling, in quadrature.

To account for non-perturbative QCD effects, including those from hadronisation and the underlying event, fixed order predictions may need to be corrected. Due to the electromagnetic nature of the hard photon, the size of such corrections for the inclusive photon cross section is of the order of 1%. This is small compared to the scale and PDF theoretical uncertainties, and is not considered further.

Similarly, contributions from electroweak corrections [23] are also not included, as they are smaller than the experimental and theoretical scale uncertainties in the kinematic region of the measurement.

Figure 5 shows the uncertainty due to the renormalisation and factorisation scale variation for the central and forward inclusive photon production cross sections. The uncertainties are shown for both the CT10 and the ABM11_5N PDF sets. The PDF uncertainties and the uncertainty on the strong coupling are also shown in the figure. Figure 6 shows the PDF uncertainties for the central and forward inclusive photon cross section. The uncertainties are illustrated for the five different NLO PDF sets: CT10, MSTW2008, ABM11_5N, HERAPDF1.5 and NNPDF2.3.

The scale and PDF uncertainties are found to be less than 10% in both the central and forward rapidity regions for \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}<700\,\) GeV, rising to approximately 30% for high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\).

The renormalisation and factorisation scale variations are shown labelled as “R+F” and are estimated as discussed in the text. For both PDFs, the figure also shows PDF uncertainty and that due to the strong coupling constant.

Sensitivity to parton distribution functions

The sensitivity of the data to the PDF can be assessed by comparing the measured cross sections to fixed order predictions based on different PDF sets. A quantitative comparison between the inclusive photon cross section measurements and predictions based on different PDF sets has been performed. The HERAFitter package [24] has been used to compute the \(\chi^{2}\) values corresponding to the predictions for each of the PDF sets. Experimental systematic uncertainties and PDF uncertainties are included in the \(\chi^{2}\) calculation.The \(\chi^{2}\) function is defined as

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i}\frac{\left[m_{i}-\sum_{j}j^{\text{exp}}_{i,j}p_{i}b_{j}^{ \text{exp}}-\sum_{j}j^{\text{theo}}_{i,j}m_{i}b_{j}^{\text{theo}}-\mu_{i}\right]^ {2}}{\delta_{i,\text{stat}}^{2}\mu_{i}\left(m_{i}-\sum_{j}\gamma^{\text{exp}}_{i,j}m_{i}b_{j}^{\text{exp}}-\sum_{j}\gamma^{\text{theo}}_{i,j}m_{i}b_{j}^{\text{ thoo}}\right)+\left(\delta_{i,\text{uncor}}\,m_{i}\right)^{2}}+\sum_{j}(b_{j}^{ \text{exp}})^{2}+\sum_{j}(b_{j}^{\text{theo}})^{2}, \tag{1}\]

where \(\mu^{i}\) is the measured cross section in the bin \(i\) with relative statistical uncertainty \(\delta_{i,\text{stat}}\) and relative uncorrelated systematic uncertainty \(\delta_{i,\text{uncor}}\), \(m^{i}\) is the theoretical prediction, \(\gamma^{\text{exp}}_{ij}\) represents relative correlated experimental systematic uncertainties, \(b_{j}^{\text{exp}}\) the corresponding shifts, \(\gamma^{\text{theo}}_{ij}\) the relative PDF uncertainties and \(b_{j}^{\text{theo}}\) their shifts. For each PDF set two \(\chi^{2}\) are evaluated, the first includes only experimental uncertainties, that is the terms \(\gamma^{\text{theo}}_{ij}\) and \(b_{j}^{\text{theo}}\)are neglected. The second \(\chi^{2}\) includes both experimental and PDF uncertainties.

Comparisons of the measured cross sections with the NLO QCD predictions using the five different PDF sets are shown in Figure 7 for MCFM and in Figure 8 for JetPhox. Figures 7(a) and 8(a) show the comparison for central photons, and Figures 7(b) and 8(b) for forward-going photons.

These figures show the ratio of the calculations to the data for each different model, both before and after applying the uncertainty shifts. The contribution of each bin to the \(\chi^{2}\) value (the pulls) are also shown.

Figure 9 shows a comparison of both MCFM and JetPhox predictions using the CT10 PDF sets to the measured cross sections. Both calculations have comparable shapes both in the central and forward regions, with a few percent differences in the normalisation in the forward region.

A comparison of the JetPhox prediction with the data is shown in Figure 10 using the CT10 PDF set, for the cases of including only the experimental uncertainty, or both the experimental and PDF uncertainties. When not including the PDF uncertainties, the pulls are approximately a factor 2 larger.

The overall \(\chi^{2}\) values evaluated between the measured cross section and MCFM NLO predictions, presented in the figures, are shown in Table 1 for the different PDF sets. The scale uncertainties are not included in the \(\chi^{2}\) definition, rather the \(\chi^{2}\) is evaluated with different choices of renormalisation and factorisation factors, \(\mu_{r}\) and \(\mu_{f}\). The envelope of the results for different scale variations is given in the table, and the \(\chi^{2}\) values are shown separately for the cases both including and excluding the PDF uncertainties.

Figure 11 shows the prediction from JetPhox compared to the data for the cases of using a fixed value for the electromagnetic coupling, \(\alpha_{\text{EM}}=1/137\), and using the 1-loop running \(\alpha_{\text{EM}}\). The calculation uses the CT10 PDF set. The JetPhox prediction including the running \(\alpha_{\text{EM}}\) predicts a larger cross section than that obtained using the fixed scale, and is in better agreement with the data although the shape is largely unchanged.

The overall \(\chi^{2}\) values evaluated by comparing the measured cross section with the JetPhox NLO predictions, and using all five of the PDF sets discussed previously, are presented in Table 2. This shows the \(\chi^{2}\) values again, evaluated using the fixed, and the 1-loop running \(\alpha_{\text{EM}}\), evaluated both including and excluding the PDF uncertainties. The values obtained when including the PDF uncertainties are shown in parentheses. There are 23 degrees of freedom.

In (a) and (b) the top right panel shows the ratio of theory to data. The middle panel shows the theoretical predictions \(m_{i}\) shifted by the experimental and PDF uncertainty shift terms \(\sum_{j}\gamma_{i,j}^{\rm exp}m_{i}b_{j}^{\rm exp}\) and \(\sum_{j}\gamma_{i,j}^{\rm theo}m_{i}b_{j}^{\rm theo}\) corresponding to the first term from Equation 1. The lower right panels show the contribution to the \(\chi^{2}\) of each bin, which corresponds to the first term of Equation 1.

The results of the \(\chi^{2}\) tests indicate that there is a tension between the measured data and the predictions for many of the current PDF sets for the central choice of renormalisation and factorisation scales which is reduced when including the PDF uncertainties, however some tension remains. Thus the data have great potential to constrain both the shape and uncertainty of the gluon distribution. However, in the region where the data are most precise, 200\(<E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}<600\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the scale uncertainty is dominant. Just as in the case of jet production, next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) calculations may be necessary to fully exploit this potential.

## 5 Conclusions

The gluon PDF at large \(x\) is responsible for a significant uncertainty in the predictions of the cross section for many important processes at the LHC. The gluon distribution predicted by PDF sets from different groups have larger differences than the quoted uncertainties on the gluon distribution itself.

In the present study the potential of the inclusive photon production cross section to constrain the gluon PDF has been considered using NLO theoretical predictions from the MCFM and JetPhox calculations. Studies using both calculations and current PDF sets indicate that the inclusive photon data from ATLAS displays sensitivity to the gluon distribution, arising from the large contribution from \(u\)-\(g\) scattering in the initial state. The data have potential to constrain both the shape and uncertainty of the gluon distribution. However, at intermediate \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\) where the data are most precise, the scale uncertainty is dominant. Therefore NNLO calculations, which are currently unavailable, may be necessary to fully exploit the measurement.
