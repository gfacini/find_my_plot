## 1 Introduction

High precision measurements of Standard Model cross sections for the production of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons, heavy quarks and jets require a precise determination of the integrated proton-proton luminosity, which should match in precision the level achieved in experiment and theory. For large-rate processes involving clean experimental signatures like isolated leptons at high \(p_{T}\) an experimental systematic uncertainty at the level of 1 % seems not unrealistic. Given the tremendous increase in accuracy of the theoretical predictions with the advent of NNLO calculations and precise tuning of PDF's with HERA data a target precision of \(2-3\) % is aimed for the luminosity by the ATLAS experiment.

A number of methods have been proposed to determine both absolute and relative luminosities. At present it is difficult to predict which method will ultimately yield the best precision, and therefore a safe strategy consists of pursuing in parallel the most promising candidates:

* inclusive production of \(W/Z\), comparison to accurate theoretical calculations of the cross section, large rate, good experimental accuracy
* \(\gamma\gamma\to\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\), \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), purely EM process, low rate, trigger conditions to be verified
* machine parameters, requires precise measurements of bunch profiles, will in any case be done for beam diagnostics
* elastic scattering in the coulomb region

ATLAS intends to build two dedicated luminosity detectors [1], the Roman Pot detector ALFA instruments the forward region around 240 m to measure small-angle elastic scattering and the Cerenkov-counter LUCID will monitor the relative luminosity over several orders of magnitude.

This note is dedicated to the measurement of elastic scattering and describes the simulation performed in order to estimate the expected experimental accuracy for the luminosity determination. The calibration of the absolute luminosity from elastic scattering will require a special optics with a large value of \(\beta^{*}\) and a betatron phase advance yielding parallel-to-point focusing such that from the particle displacement in the transversal plane the scattering angle and hence the \(t\)-value can be reconstructed. The required beam conditions allow only for a running at very low luminosity around \(10^{27}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). Given the large elastic cross section of about 30 mb in a week of running sufficient statistics is accumulated. During that period also LUCID will take data and its integrated rate will be calibrated to the measured luminosity.

It should be noted that beyond the purpose of luminosity determination, running the ALFA detector will also provide precious knowledge of the beam conditions and gain of experience on the operation of forward detectors close to the beam, relevant for future detectors, aiming for the observation of hard central diffraction. From the measured \(t\)-spectrum we will not only determine the luminosity, but also fundamental soft physics parameter like the total cross section \(\sigma_{tot}\), the nuclear slope \(B\) and the \(\rho\)-parameter.

The layout of this note is organised as follows: In section 2 the experimental set-up and the simplifications in its simulation are described, in section 3 the acceptance and resolution for the measurement of the \(t\)-spectrum are given, the method to extract the luminosity and the associated experimental systematic uncertainties are presented in section 4 before to conclude in section 5.

## 2 Simulation of the Experimental set-up

The basic experimental set-up is described in [1]. It consists of 4 Roman Pot stations, two on each side of IP1, at 240m distance, between Q6 and Q7. The two stations in each arm are separated by 4 m. Each station houses two vertical Roman Pots which can be positioned precisely close to the beam. The ALFA detector instruments the Roman Pots with a scintillating fibre tracker. The detector consists of 10 central double-sided detection planes with 64 squared scintillating fibres of \(0.5\times 0.5\) mm\({}^{2}\) section on each side. The fibres are arranged in U-V geometry with an angle of \(+45^{o}\) on the U-side and \(-45^{o}\) on the V-side. The 10 planes are staggered by multiples of a tenth of the effective fibre pitch, i.e. \(500\times\sqrt{2}/10\). In addition a plain scintillator plane covering the crossing area of the central fibres provides a level one trigger signal. The vertical alignment of the upper with respect to the lower detector is achieved by dedicated overlap detector located in the extrusions of the pots, which overlap in the beam position. The overlap detectors are also build of scintillating fibres with 30 horizontal fibres on each extrusion side (left/right). Three staggered planes of overlap detectors are foreseen to complement the set-up.

Further details on the detectors and their associated electronics are given in [2], and results for prototype-detectors in test-beams can be consulted in [3].

### Elastic scattering generation

The simulation chain starts with the generation of elastic \(pp\) scattering. The event generator PYTHIA[4] version 6.326 was modified to include the Coulomb amplitude and the \(\rho\) term in the generation of the \(t\)-spectrum according to the cross section

\[\frac{d\sigma}{dt} = \pi\mid f_{C}+f_{N}\mid^{2} \tag{1}\] \[= \frac{4\pi\alpha^{2}(\hbar c)^{2}}{\mid t\mid^{2}}-\frac{\alpha \,\rho\,\sigma_{tot}}{\mid t\mid}\cdot\exp\frac{-B\mid t\mid}{2}+\frac{\sigma _{tot}^{2}}{16\pi(\hbar c)^{2}}\left(1+\rho^{2}\right)\cdot\exp-B\mid t\mid,\]

where \(\alpha\) is the electromagnetic fine-structure constant, \(\rho\) the ratio of the imaginary and real part of the nuclear scattering amplitude, \(B\) the nuclear slope for \(pp\) scattering and \(\sigma_{tot}\) the total cross section for \(pp\to X\) at the LHC. The default version of PYTHIA does not include the Coulomb term and it should be noted that the modified cross is divergent for \(t\to 0\). The fast rise of the cross section is slightly modified by the introduction of the electric form factor of the proton \(G(t)\), which is, however, neglected for the purpose of this note. In practice the divergence is avoided by a cut-off set to \(t_{min}=5\ 10^{-5}\) GeV\({}^{2}\) in the event generation. The elastic cross section predicted by the default version of PYTHIA is 22.208 mb. All simulations with the modified version are carried out with \(\sigma_{tot}=101.511\) mb, \(B=18\) GeV\({}^{-2}\) and \(\rho=0.15\) yielding an effective elastic cross section \(\sigma_{el}^{eff}=34.29\) mb from the integration of eq.1, hence including also the electromagnetic contribution, with the cut-off mentioned above. A certain but unavoidable arbitrariness affects the choice of the values for these parameters, given their large uncertainty for the LHC [5], but this choice won't have an substantial impact on the evaluation of the experimental systematic uncertainties.

### Beam optics and transport

The main parameters of the beam optics satisfying the requests resulting from the small-angle elastic measurement are summarised in Table 1. The key feature of this optics is the parallel-to-point focusing with a phase advance of \(90^{\circ}\) of the betatron function in the vertical plane. The luminosity for this setting being very small, it is believed that a very small emittance of \(\epsilon_{N}=1\)\(\mu\)rad m is achievable. In order to approach the beam with the detectors at 10 \(\sigma_{\mbox{\scriptsize\it be\,am}}\) a good cleaning efficiency is needed and the halo and background conditions must be affordable. A large value of \(\beta^{*}\), actually of \(L_{eff}=\sqrt{\beta\cdot\beta^{*}}\sin\Psi\), ensures the reach of the small-\(t\) Coulomb region.

Unlike particles produced by an inelastic _pp_ interaction in ATLAS, the trajectory of elastically scattered protons from IP1 to the Roman Pots is determined by the optical functions defining the lattice of the magnetic elements of the LHC accelerator. In the simulation this is achieved by the thin lenses tracking module of MADX [6] which uses the official optics files [7] for the dedicated luminosity optics.

In practice, some of the features of the incoming beams are taken into account at generator level. This concerns the divergence of the beam \(\sigma^{\prime}\), i.e. the angular spread of the two protons, which entails a small crossing angle, nominally vanishing. The distribution of the half crossing angle has a mean at zero and width of \(\sigma^{\prime}=0.226\,\mu\)rad. The the incoming beams are affected by an intrinsic energy spread, i.e. the nominal energy of 7 TeV is altered by a small amount resulting in a energy distribution of \(\Delta p/p\) with a width of \(1.13\,10^{-4}\). By dispersion this energy variation leads to a small displacement of the particles off the nominal orbit at the detector position. Finally the beam spot with a width in \(x\) and \(y\) of \(\sigma=594\mu\)m is also generated in PYTHIA for the outgoing protons. The scattered protons are then fed into the MADX program for the transport through the lattice to the observation places at the Roman pots. At present only files for beam 1 are available and both protons are tracked clockwise along beam 1, assuming tracking symmetry between beam 1 and beam 2.

### Hit generation

The impacts of the tracks are recorded in the transverse plane at the position of the detectors. About 15 % of the tracks don't make up to this point because they are outside the beam aperture and lost in some collimator or beam screen. Valid events are accepted if they have hits in two stations at both sides, i.e. if their space coordinates are reconstructed in 4

detectors. The detector acceptance is at present simulated by means of simple geometrical cuts corresponding to the active detection area. At a later stage we intend to implement a full GEANT4 simulation, currently under development [8]. The true hits generated in the detector are smeared to simulate the detector resolution by a Gaussian smearing with a width of 21 \(\mu\)m, according to the full simulation expectation [8] tuned to describe the observed testbeam performance at lower energies [3]. The detector efficiency within the active area is assumed to be 100 %, in agreement with the testbeam result \(\epsilon>99\%\). The vertical position of the detector, defined by the distance between the centre of the beam and the lower edge of the detector \(y_{d}\), is a variable parameter in the simulation and is set by default to 1.5 mm.

In total 10 million events were generated and simulated, which corresponds to about 100 hours of data taking at \({\cal L}\)=10\({}^{27}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and represents the minimal statistics to perform the luminosity calibration with sufficient precision. In addition several data sets were generated with modified detector/beam parameters in order to study their systematic influence.

The reconstructed hit pattern of the 10 M simulated and accepted events at RP1 is shown in Fig. 1.

## 3 Measurement of the \(t\)-spectrum

In general a particle coordinates at a distance \(u\) (\(u=x,y\)) from the nominal orbit in a transverse plane at any position \(s\) along the ring is related to the particle coordinates and momenta at the interaction point by the transport matrix \(M\)

\[\left(\begin{array}{c}u(s)\\ u^{\prime}(s)\\ \Delta p(s)/p\end{array}\right)={\bf M}\left(\begin{array}{c}u^{*}\\ u^{*\prime}\\ \Delta p^{*}/p\end{array}\right)\;, \tag{1}\]

\[{\bf M}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}\sqrt{\beta/\beta^{*}}(\cos\Psi+\alpha^{*} \sin\Psi)&\sqrt{\beta\beta^{*}}\sin\Psi&D\\ \frac{(\alpha^{*}-\alpha)\cos\Psi-(1+\alpha\alpha^{*})\sin\Psi}{\sqrt{\beta \beta^{*}}}&\sqrt{\beta/\beta^{*}}(\cos\Psi-\alpha\sin\Psi)&D^{\prime}\\ 0&0&1\end{array}\right)\;, \tag{2}\]

where \(\alpha\) is the derivative of the beta-function and \(D\) is the dispersion, which is very small and can be neglected for elastic scattering. With this simplification the coordinate relation reduces to

\[u = m_{11}\cdot u^{*}+m_{12}\cdot u^{*\prime}\,, \tag{3}\] \[= \sqrt{\beta/\beta^{*}}(\cos\Psi+\alpha^{*}\sin\Psi)\cdot u^{*}+ \sqrt{\beta\beta^{*}}\sin\Psi\cdot u^{*\prime}\;.\]

In general there are contributions from the slope and the position of tracks at the IP to the position at the detector. In the combination of the left and the right arm measurements and by making use of the specific back-to-back topology of elastic events the unknown contribution from the vertex cancels out. Denoting the position measurements from the left arm \(u_{L}\) and the right arm \(u_{R}\) the constraints from the elastic topology infer

\[u^{*}_{L}=u^{*}_{R}=u^{*}\;,\;\;u^{*\prime}_{L}=-u^{*\prime}_{R}=u^{*\prime}\;,\]and for the difference between the left and right measurement we obtain

\[u_{L}-u_{R} = m_{11}\cdot u^{*}+m_{12}\cdot u^{*\prime}-m_{11}\cdot u^{*}+m_{12} \cdot u^{*\prime}\;,\] \[= 2m_{12}\cdot u^{*\prime}\;,\] \[u^{*\prime}=\theta_{u} = \frac{u_{L}-u_{R}}{2m_{12}}=\frac{u_{L}-u_{R}}{2L_{eff,u}}\;,\] \[L_{eff,u} = \sqrt{\beta\beta^{*}}\sin\Psi\;, \tag{10}\]

where the scattering angle at the IP \(\theta\) and effective lever arm \(L_{eff}\) are introduced.

Figure 1: Hit pattern of 10M simulated events in RP1 at 239 m. The red cloud corresponds the hit density of all events the black rings are selected values of \(t\) with a width of \(\pm\) 20%. The blue lines show the outer circumference of the ALFA detector, the horizontal lines indicate the vertical aperture of the LHC as observed in MADX.

A large lever arm results into a good measurement of the scattering angle. In the vertical plane the phase advance is \(\pi/2\) and the value for the lever arm is 595 m, in the horizontal plane the parallel-to-point focusing is not exactly realised and the value of \(\sin\Psi\) is about 0.3 leading to a lever arm of 130 m. For small angle elastic scattering the \(t\)-value is given by

\[-t=\left(p\theta^{*}\right)^{2}\, \tag{10}\]

where \(p=7\) TeV is the nominal beam momentum. Collecting all information from the two stations and two arms and splitting the scattering angle into its \(x\)- and \(y\)-components the reconstructed value of \(t\) is obtained as follows

\[-t_{i=1,2} = p^{2}\left(\theta_{x,i}^{2}+\theta_{y,i}^{2}\right) \tag{11}\] \[t = \left(t_{1}+t_{2}\right)/2\, \tag{12}\]

where the index \(i=1,2\) refers to the two stations at resp. 237 m and 241 m.

### Acceptance

The acceptance for elastic events with a coincidence trigger signal in all four stations is shown in Fig. 2 as function of \(t\). The acceptance reaches a maximum at \(-t=0.05\) GeV\({}^{2}\) of about 95 % and decreases for smaller \(t\) given the insensitive zone between the detector edge and the beam core, and for larger \(t\) because of increasing absorption in the collimators. The overall acceptance for \(y_{d}=1.5\) mm is about 66 %. The acceptance for small \(t\) depends crucially on the distance between the detector and the beam. In order to gain sensitivity to Coulomb interference region \(\mid f_{C}\mid\approx\mid f_{N}\mid\) where the luminosity decouples from total cross section a minimal value of \(t\)

\[-t_{min}\approx\frac{8\pi\alpha}{\sigma_{tot}}\approx 6\times 10^{-4}\,\mbox{GeV} ^{2}\]

must be reached. For \(y_{d}=1.5\)mm at \(-t=5.5\times 10^{-4}\)GeV\({}^{2}\) an acceptance of about 50% is obtained. A minimum of 50 % for the acceptance should be requested in order to keep the corresponding corrections and their systematic uncertainties at a reasonable level. The reach in \(t_{min}\) for an acceptance of at least 50 % is shown in Fig. 3 as function of the distance to the beam. Again it appears of highest importance to approach the beam as much as possible. It will depend on cleaning efficiency of the machine and the resulting halo properties how close the detector can be placed.

### Resolution

The resolution in \(t\) is estimated from the comparison of the generated value \(\hat{t}\) and the reconstructed value \(t_{rec}\). Since the resolution depends on the actual value of \(t\) the data are sliced in bins of \(\log(-t)\) of constant width and in each bin the RMS of the normalised residual distribution \((\hat{t}-t_{rec})/\hat{t}\) is calculated. The relative resolution obtained with this procedure is shown in Fig. 4. At small \(t\) a relative resolution of 10 % is obtained, which decreases for larger \(t\) scaling roughly with \(1/\sqrt{-t}\) to about 1 % at \(t=-0.1\) GeV\({}^{-2}\). From Fig. 4 it becomes clear that the \(t\)-resolution is dominated by the divergence of the beam,hile the intrinsic detector resolution contributes only modestly and other effects like vertex smearing and the beam dispersion are negligible. In presence of beam divergence the approximation \(-t\approx(p\theta^{*})^{2}\) becomes less precise since \(\hat{t}\) is modified by the crossing angle in the initial state. A correction has to be applied to the reconstructed \(t\)-spectrum to take this effect into account. This requires also a good measurement of the actual beam divergence in order to keep the systematic uncertainties associated to the correction small. The beam divergence is given by

\[\sigma^{\prime}=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{N}}{\beta^{*}\gamma}}\,\]

which means that the precision of the divergence will also depend on the precision of the measurement of the emittance. The impact of the beam divergence can already be studied at generator level level using the angles of the outgoing protons, without tracking to the Roman Pots. This is illustrated in Fig. 5 where the resolution is shown as function of \(t\) for three values of the emittance.

The divergence of the beam can also be quantified in terms of the angular smearing of the beam, i.e. by the width \(\theta_{i}\) of the angular distributions of the incoming beams, as shown in Fig. 5 for selected values of \(t\).

[FIGURE

Figure 2: Acceptance of the experimental set-up as function of \(t\) for three different distances to the beam \(y_{d}\).

### Alignment

The reconstruction of the \(t\)-value relies on knowledge of the position of the detector with respect to the centre of the beam. The beam position will be monitored by a beam position monitor (BPM) close to the Roman Pots. The BPM will monitor with good accuracy relative movements of the beam, within a fill or from fill to fill. Its absolute precision, however, is not expected to be better than 100 \(\mu\)m.

Therefore the dedicated overlap detectors [2] will provide a better determination of the distance of the upper to the lower pot within a station. The measured beam profile with the central tracking detector can be used to determine the centre of the beam on the basis of symmetry arguments. A symmetric offset can only be measured in the overlap detectors, with a precision of 10 \(\mu\)m.

The effect of a residual mis-alignment on the \(t\)-spectrum is shown in Fig. 6.

The contribution to the \(t\)-resolution is rather small, i.e. the width of the distribution of the residuals is merely increased. But a new effect is observed, which is a systematic shift of the reconstructed \(t\)-value, it can be seen in the mean value of the distribution of the residuals, also shown in Fig. 6. This change of the \(t\)-scale is most prominent at small \(t\) and

Figure 3: Reach in \(t_{min}\) for an acceptance above 50 % as function of the distance to the beam.

decreases rapidly with increasing \(t\). For small \(t\) and a symmetric offset of 10 \(\mu\)m the shift of the \(t\)-scale is as large as 1%.

### Vertex reconstruction

The two stations in each arm are separated by 4.14 m. The measurement of the track positions in the two stations can be combined into a measurement of the local trajectory slope between the two stations. Neglecting the energy dispersion and having obtained a measurement of the particle displacement \(u\) and its angle \(u^{\prime}\) at the Roman Pots the transport equation 1 can be solved for the particle vertex and angle at IP1 by inverting the transport matrix eq. 2.

\[\vec{u^{*}}=\mathbf{M}^{-1}\;\vec{u} \tag{10}\]

According to eq. 2 the matrix inversion needed for the vertex reconstruction involves also the \(\alpha\)-function at the Roman Pots. In Fig. 7 the reconstructed vertex position \((x^{*},y^{*})\) is shown in comparison with the generated vertex, together with the residuals. Note that with the present experimental set-up the \(z\) position of the vertex can not be determined

Figure 4: Resolution in \(t\) as function of \(t\). The total resolution including all effects is shown as full line, individual contributions are indicated by dashed/dotted lines.

precisely, a rough estimate may be obtained on a statistical basis for a systematic displacement of the \(z\)-vertex from the BPMs located close to IP1. A precise event-by-event determination would require a timing measurement (difference of the arrival time between left and right stations), as envisaged for the upgraded detectors for forward physics.

Given the parallel-to-point focusing in the vertical plane the \(y\)-component of the vertex is with a resolution of 3 mm less well reconstructed than the \(x\)-component with 0.7 mm resolution. The vertex reconstruction receives two contributions, one from the displacement measurement (of high accuracy) and one from the slope measurement (of moderate quality \(\Delta u^{\prime}\approx\Delta(u_{1}-u_{2})/\Delta z\approx\sqrt{2}\times 21/4.14 \;10^{6}\approx 7\,\mu\)rad). In the vertical plane the position at the Roman Pot is essentially independent from the vertex, while in the horizontal plane both position and slope contribute sizably to the vertex determination.

The primary purpose of the vertex measurement is to reject background tracks not originating from the interaction point by requesting the vertex to be inside an elliptical area shown in Fig. 7 with half-axes \(a=4mm\) and \(b=14mm\), which does not reduce the signal statistics while suppressing a good fraction of the background.

### Background rejection

Two classes of background sources are considered: background originating from non-elastic interactions at the IP and background from accidental coincidences of halo events. As source for non-elastic background single diffraction processes are taken into account. Double diffraction, minimum bias and deep-inelastic processes can either from their cross section or topology be excluded as background. The simulation for secondary halo background contains distant quasi-elastic beam-gas interactions and protons surviving Betatron- and Momentum-cleaning collimation.

The evolution of the \(t\)-res\(\dot{\rm o}\)tion as function of the smearing angle \(\Theta_{i}\) for selected \(t\) values (right).

#### Single diffraction background

A simple model for single diffraction (SD) is implemented in PYTHIA for two distinct processes \(pp\to p+X\) and \(pp\to X+p\) with a total cross section of 14.3 mb. While the scattered proton has kinematics similar to the elastic case and will often leave a signature in the ALFA detector, the particles generated by the diffractively dissociated proton are mostly absorbed by the beam pipe or upstream collimators. Only a small fraction of these events will produce a particle at high energy and small scattering angle able to travel through the lattice.

The background simulation proceeds along the same lines as for the elastic signal. According to the predicted SD cross section 4.2 M SD events are generated corresponding to 10M signal events. Already at generator level an energy cut is imposed on the leading particle from the diffractive system \(E_{diff}\geq 5\) TeV. Only events with a proton resulting from the diffractive process with an energy above 5 TeV is generated in addition to the opposite scattered proton are passed through the lattice simulation. This cut survives about 8.8% of the SD events. Particles with smaller energy are very likely to be absorbed

in the collimators latest after the first quadrupoles by dispersion.

The remaining events are passed through MADX. Even with the primary energy cut only 70% of the scattered protons and 17% of the diffractive protons make it to the Roman Pots, the others are lost in the machine. A good fraction of these events is also outside the ALFA acceptance and only finally 6% of the events from the IP are seen by the detector. The remaining events are already at a negligible level and can further be reduced by acollinearity and vertex cuts.

The vertex cut is tuned to preserve 99.7% of the elastic signal and rejects events outside an elliptical area with half-axes \(a=4mm\) and \(b=14mm\).

For elastic scattering and in absence of beam divergence the amplitude of scattering angle is the same at the left and right side and the sign is opposite, therefore acollinearity defined by

\[\Phi_{Au}=\mid\overline{\theta}_{u}^{R}+\overline{\theta}_{u}^{L}\mid, \,\overline{\theta}_{u}=\left(\theta_{u,1}+\theta_{u,2}\right)/2\,\,,\theta_{ u,i}\approx\frac{u_{i}}{L_{eff,u,i}}\,\,,u=x,y \tag{10}\]

where the index \(i=1,2\) refers to the two stations at 239 resp. 243 \(\,\)m. Since the angles have to be determined separately for both arms, the contribution from the vertex position does not cancel and degrades the resolution in the horizontal plane. Therefore the angle is split into its two components and separate cuts are applied: \(\Phi_{Ay}<1\,\mu rad\), \(\Phi_{Ax}<5\,\mu rad\). These cuts accept 99.7% of the elastic events. The back-to-back topology of elastic events, only diluted by instrumental effects, enables a very efficient rejection using the acollinearity cut, as illustrated in Fig. 8. The same cuts are also applied to secondary halo events (see next section).

The reduction of the SD background at each stage is summarised in Table 2.

Figure 7: The reconstructed vertex position (back points) compared to the generated vertex (red points), the elliptical line contains 99.7% of the elastic events (left). The residuals in \(x\) and \(y\) of the vertex measurement (right).

At the end 166 SD events survive compared to 6,639,285 selected elastic events, the irreducible SD background amounts to about \(3\times 10^{-3}\%\). No subtraction of this background is considered at this stage and also the potential impact on the systematic uncertainty for the luminosity is neglected.

### Halo background

The secondary halo background is determined from a dedicated simulation [10], which resulted in differential distribution of background protons originating from three distinct

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c|} \hline  & Number of events & fraction [\%] \\ \hline generated & 4.17 M & 100 \\ \(E_{diff}\geq 5\) TeV & 365 045 & 8.75 \\ scattered protons at RP & 253 271 & 6.07 \\ diffracted protons at RP & 60678 & 1.46 \\ both protons at RP & 4899 7 & 1.18 \\ both protons inside acceptance & 13825 & 0.33 \\ after vertex cut & 479 & 0.011 \\ after acollinearity cut & 166 & 0.004 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

ources: momentum and betatron cleaning inefficiencies and distant beam-gas scattering. The observables are the positions in \(x\) and \(y\) of background protons as well as their angles, observed at the Roman Pots. As an example the distribution of the vertical position \(y\), normalized to the vertical width of the primary beam, is shown in Fig. 9. It can be seen that at large \(y\), inside the detector acceptance, the beam-gas is the dominant contribution. These distributions are used to determine sequentially the single background, accidental coincidence rate and the total amount of background events to be added to the elastic signal sample. Since the input distribution represent the number of background protons \(N_{b}\) generated per proton in the primary beam, this can be turned into a single background rate using

\[R_{bs}=N_{b}\times\frac{k_{bunch}\cdot k_{part}}{\tau}\;, \tag{10}\]

where for the high-\(\beta^{*}\)-running the number of bunches \(k_{bunch}\) is 43, the number of particles per bunch \(k_{part}\) is \(10^{10}\) and \(\tau\) is contribution to the beam lifetime for a given background source.

The lifetimes for momentum- and betatron-cleaning are assumed to be the same as for the nominal collision optics and equal to 100 hours. The beam-gas lifetime contribution, however, is strongly dependent on the dynamic gas pressure, in particular in the arcs, which in turn depends on the actual beam current. For collision optics simulations advertise a beam-gas lifetime contribution of 100 hours [11], but for our beam conditions \(\tau=1000\) hours is a very safe estimate.

Figure 9: The distribution of the vertical impact position of secondary halo background protons (ourtesy of I. Bayshev).

The accidental coincidence background rate is obtained from

\[R_{acc}=R_{bs}^{2}\cdot\Delta t_{bunch}\,\]

with the bunch separation \(\Delta t_{bunch}=2.021\mu\)s for 43 bunches in the machine. Obviously the rate will depend on the vertical detector position \(y_{d}\). The integrated beam-gas background rates for \(y>y_{d}\) are given in Table 3.

The accidental rates in Table 3 are to be compared to the elastic signal rate of about 27.8 Hz. For technical reasons background events are simulated above 11 \(\sigma_{y}\) with a rate of 7.82 Hz for beam-gas, of 0.9 Hz for betatron cleaning and of 0.027 Hz for momentum cleaning processes. At this stage no mixed background (e.g. beam-gas + momentum cleaning) is considered since the time-structure of these processes is different. In total 3,151,000 background events are generated, out of which 2,82 M are of beam-gas type and 330000 of betatron cleaning. These events are to be overlaid to the elastic signal sample of 10 M events. From Table 3 it becomes clear that most of the background is accumulated at the detector edge close to the beam, hence at small \(t\), and may endanger the luminosity measurement.

#### Halo background rejection

As in the case of single diffraction the rejection of halo background is based on the reconstructed vertex and on the left-right acollinearity. The cuts applied are the same as for SD background. The reduction of the halo background at each stage is summarised in Table 4. The rejection power of the acollinearity cuts eliminating 75 % of the after vertex cuts still remaining background is illustrated in Fig. 10.

The surviving 140k irreducible background events represent in total only 2.1 % of the accepted elastic signal, but at small \(t\) the signal-to-background ratio is a small as 1.3, as shown in Fig. 11.

#### Background subtraction

The residual irreducible background has to be subtracted off the reconstructed \(t\)-spectrum before the luminosity can be fit. A common procedure consists of a subtraction based on Monte Carlo simulation, but in the case of halo background such simulations are difficult and subject to large systematic uncertainties. Alternatively, the background can also be determined from the data directly, as follows. The signal and its irreducible background are selected in the asymmetric \(+-\) and \(-+\) configurations, meaning protons are detected either in the top (\(+\)) pots of left stations and bottom (\(-\)) pots of the right stations (\(+-\) configuration) or vice versa in the bottom pots of the left arm and top pots of the right arm (\(-+\) configuration). In contrast to the elastic signal, the background is also detected in symmetric topologies (\(++\) and \(--\)), which is'signal-free'. These events are registered within a physics run under same beam and background conditions as for the elastic signal, taking

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c|} \hline  & Number of events & fraction [\%] \\ \hline generated & 3.151 M & 100 \\ accepted by ALFA & 1126140 & 35.7 \\ after vertex cut & 580703 & 18.4 \\ after acollinearity cut & 139702 & 4.43 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

into account variations of the conditions within a fill. A good estimate of the \(t\)-distribution of the irreducible background can now be obtained from the identified symmetric configuration by inverting the sign of the measured \(y\)-position randomly in the left or right arm \(y_{R/L}\to-y_{R/L}\) while keeping the original position in the other arm \(y_{L/R}\to-y_{L/R}\). The total amount of symmetric configurations \(N_{sy}=(N++)+(N--)\) is not necessarily the same as the asymmetric configurations \(N_{as}=(N+-)+(N-+)\), because the background distribution in \(y\) may be slightly asymmetric (the simulated background is symmetric, but real background might be different). A correction for this effect can also be obtained from the data by counting the symmetric top and bottom configurations. The probability to observe a proton in the top(bottom) pot in either arm \(x_{p}(x_{m})\) is

\[x_{p}=\sqrt{\frac{N++}{N_{sy}}}\;,x_{m}=\sqrt{\frac{N--}{N_{sy}}}\;, \tag{3.11}\]

and probability to have an asymmetric configuration is

\[x_{as}=2x_{p}x_{m}\;. \tag{3.12}\]

Therefore the background distribution calculated from symmetric events has to be scaled by the correction factor

\[C_{bg}=\frac{2x_{p}x_{m}}{x_{p}^{2}+x_{m}^{2}}\;,\]

before subtracting off the signal. In all other aspects the calculated background \(t\)-distribution is identical to the irreducible background and it should be emphasized again it is obtained from the data and takes also possible variations of the background conditions during a run into account. This method is free of any Monte Carlo input and is only limited by the statistical accuracy of the symmetric background sample. The procedure and its performance is illustrated in Fig. 12.

### Corrections to the \(t\)-spectrum

Before the data can be presented to the fitting routines in order to extract the luminosity a number of corrections have to be applied to the reconstructed spectra. These are applied as bin-by-bin corrections individually for each effect to be corrected for in the following way:

\[D(t)^{corr}=\left(D(t)^{reco}-D(t)^{back}\right)\cdot A(t)^{det}\cdot A(t)^{ acc}\cdot A(t)^{div}\, \tag{3.13}\]

where

* \({\bf D(t)^{corr}}\) is the resulting corrected \(t\)-distribution,

Figure 12: The true halo background compared to the calculated background using symmetric background events.

* \(\mathbf{D(t)^{reco}}\) is the reconstructed \(t\)-distribution at detector level,
* \(\mathbf{D(t)^{back}}\) is the calculated halo background distribution to be subtracted,
* \(\mathbf{A(t)^{det}}\) is the ratio of the \(t\)-spectrum without detector resolution, i.e. for an ideal detector and the the spectrum measured with the real detector,
* \(\mathbf{A(t)^{acc}}\) is the ratio of the spectrum before and after acceptance selection,
* \(\mathbf{A(t)^{div}}\) is the ratio of the true spectrum of \(\hat{t}\), and the spectrum of \(t\) in presence of beam divergence, both derived at generator level.

In the future more sophisticated correction schemes, like unfolding of resolution or divergence effects by means of transition matrices may be envisaged. The present limited statistics of the simulation to 10M events allows only for a simple correction scenario.

The background subtraction is important in particular at small \(t\), it is to be applied at the first stage before any other correction. The detector resolution correction is rather small and the associated correction close to unity. It should be kept in mind that this correction does not yet take into account the divergence of the beam, but only the transition from the \(t\)-value at the generator, determined by the angles of the outgoing protons at IP1, which are already affected by the divergence, to the value reconstructed at the Roman Pots. Hence, this correction accounts for the intrinsic detector resolution and for the reconstruction method using the beam optics with, for instance, not perfect parallel-to-point focusing in the horizontal plane.

The divergence correction is shown in Fig. 13, where the true spectrum is compared to the spectrum with beam divergence, together with the resulting correction function. At small \(t\) the correction amounts up to 7 %, decreases to 2 % at the lower edge of the fit range around \(-t=5\cdot 10^{-4}\) GeV\({}^{2}\) and becomes negligible for large \(t\).

The most important correction is for the acceptance. The associated correction is the inverse of the acceptance function shown in Fig. 2.

The sequence of the corrections and their impact on the raw spectrum is illustrated in Fig. 14.

## 4 Luminosity determination

The standard elastic scattering formula

\[\frac{dN}{dt}=L\left(\frac{4\pi\alpha^{2}(\hbar c)^{2}}{\mid t\mid^{2}}-\frac{ \alpha\,\rho\,\sigma_{tot}}{\mid t\mid}\cdot\exp\frac{-B\mid t\mid}{2}+\frac{ \sigma_{tot}^{2}}{16\pi(\hbar c)^{2}}\left(1+\rho^{2}\right)\cdot\exp-B\mid t \mid\right), \tag{10}\]

is fit to the corrected reconstructed \(t\)-distribution with four free parameters \(L\), \(\sigma_{tot}\), \(B\) and \(\rho\). The luminosity determined by the fit corresponds to the integrated luminosity in mb\({}^{-1}\) and is converted into an average instantaneous luminosity assuming a running time of 100 hours. Equivalently the input luminosity of the generated sample is obtained from the theoretical cross section \(\sigma_{el}=34.29\) mb and the running time. The \(t\)-spectrum is reconstructed and corrected in two different representations: as \(t\) in a linear scale in 10000 bins of width \(2\times 10^{-5}\) GeV\({}^{2}\) and as logarithmic transformation \(\tau=\log(-t)\) in 100 bins of width 0.05, the two options are referred to as _linear_ and _logarithmic_. The linear representation requires a small binning in order to observe the Coulomb peak and splitting the distribution in a fine binning enhances the sensitivity to the parameters, but suffers from statistical fluctuations with increasing \(t\), in particular for the corrections, given the limited amount of simulated events. On the other hand the logarithmic representation with its large bin size is less affected by fluctuations while the Coulomb regime is nicely separated from the nuclear part, but may also integrate out some details in the interference region resulting in loss of sensitivity to the luminosity. More sophisticated binning schemes are conceivable, linear scales with variable increasing binning for example, the two options presented here can be considered as boundary configurations. Fits to the two representations of the \(t\)-spectrum are shown in Fig. 15.

The fit results are summarised in Table 5. With the anticipated statistics of 10 M events a statistical uncertainty of about 1.8 % for the luminosity is obtained. Also the total cross section and the nuclear scope are determined with good accuracy, while the \(\rho\)-parameters uncertainty is not better than 4 %. The fit quality indicates that the corrections where properly taken into account and don't induce any

distortions of the spectrum. The fit range is primarily set by a threshold of the acceptance corrections to be below 2, the logarithmic fit fully exploits this range, the linear fit is more restricted in the large \(t\) region. This entails slightly different sensitivities to the fit parameters. In both cases a large correlation between the fit parameters is observed.

Figure 14: Step-by-step from the raw \(t\)-distribution to the corrected spectrum: the black histogram is the raw input spectrum, the magenta curve represents the spectrum after correction for the detector resolution (almost identical), the blue histogram, sizably above the previous curves, is also corrected for acceptance and the red curve is the fully corrected spectrum, the small correction for the divergence at small \(t\) is invisible at the scale of the plot.

\end{table}
Table 5: Fit results for the luminosity and forward physics parameters.

n particular the luminosity is anti-correlated with the total cross section with a linear correlation coefficient of about -99%. The correlation between \(L\) and \(B\) is about 50% and between \(L\) and \(\rho\) about 85%. This correlation has to be monitored carefully, as a statistical fluctuation in the data may induce a shift in one of the parameters compensated by a change of the fitted value of another parameter.

It is instructive to consider as option the injection of an external value of the total cross section, as it may be determined in the future by the TOTEM experiment [9] or from some theoretical calculation. Assuming a total uncertainty for \(\sigma_{tot}\) of 1%, then the statistical error on the luminosity is reduced to the negligible level of 0.1%, and the correlations between the parameters are greatly reduced. On the other side the uncertainty of \(\sigma_{tot}\) (\(\pm\)1%) would induce a systematic uncertainty of about 2% on the luminosity. Hence, an improved luminosity determination is only feasible if the total cross section is known to better than 1% accuracy.

### Systematic uncertainties

Experimental systematic uncertainties arise from the limited precision of the knowledge of the properties of the beam or the detector, required for the reconstruction or the correction of the \(t\)-spectrum. Within the current simulation frame not all aspects can be investigated in detail, at some instances simplifications have to be made, which can be refined in the future. In other cases, like the background conditions through secondary halo, present and future simulations have to be taken with a lot of care and reliable information will only come from a real measurement once the LHC is running.

#### Beam divergence and crossing angle

The divergence of the beam, characterised by the RMS of the distribution of the angle

between the \(z\)-axis and the actual proton orbit, entails a systematic distortion of the \(t\)-spectrum at small \(t\).

The mean of the crossing angle \(\Phi_{A}\) for the high \(\beta^{*}\) optics is nominally zero, but this mean can only be measured to a certain precision. Mean and sigma of the crossing angle distribution are needed to derive corrections, and the impact of their uncertainty on the luminosity determination has to be estimated. This is done by assuming a distribution in the simulation with divergence parameters shifted by their uncertainty and re-calculating the correct probability. The fit result using the modified corrections yield the systematic uncertainty on the luminosity, given in Table 6. The uncertainties obtained are in any case below 1% and with the conservative assumption that the divergence is known with \(\pm 10\%\) error and the non-zero mean crossing angle is not larger than \(0.2\mu\)rad the resulting uncertainty for \(L\) is below 0.4%.

### Acceptance

Since the acceptance corrections are large and rapidly changing with \(t\) any uncertainty on their absolute size or slope has a direct impact on the luminosity. At present the acceptance correction is obtained from the simulation, where the detector in implemented by means geometrical cuts. The detector geometry can be inferred from the metrology measurements [3] with a precision of 10 \(\mu\)m on the edges defining the detection volume. The most critical edge is the lower one close to the beam window. The luminosity uncertainty is derived by assuming for each detector individually a detection area enlarged/reduced by edges shifted by \(\pm\) 10 \(\mu\)m on each side. There are 256 combinations for 8 detectors to be either larger or smaller by this amount, each combination has an equal probability, and many configurations are conceptually equivalent. In a worst-case scenario all detectors are modified coherently in the same direction, leading to a maximum uncertainty. More realistically an average error is calculated from all combinations, where equivalent configurations have been simulated only once and are weighted with their multiplicity.

It should be noted that difference between these correction sets is rather small, while the statistical error on the difference is large, since the difference is typically based on a small number of events. Therefore the quoted systematic uncertainties receive also a statistical component, which will decrease in future with higher statistics for the simulation. The resulting uncertainty for the luminosity is given in Table 7. The range between the maximum and average error spans between 0.4% and 1.7% and indicates that a systematic coherent acceptance error is to be avoided, while a random error can be tolerated. Ultimately the effective detection area will be determined from the

data, as shown in Fig. 1. Large statistics will be accumulated in the lower edge region and also the upper detection limit, induced by the vertical beam aperture, will be sufficiently populated. The position of the side edges will be measured by metrology or in a testbeam, these sides impact on the acceptance is limited as few signal particles are expected in this region.

### Alignment

A mis-alignment of the detector has two consequences: First it induces a systematic shift of the \(t\)-scale and second it changes with the absolute position of the detector in space also the acceptance. As outlined in section 3 it is foreseen that the vertical alignment of the pots with respect to the beam can be achieved with a precision of 10 \(\mu\)m. For the estimation of the alignment uncertainty it is assumed that a residual symmetric misalignment, i.e. a mirror-symmetric offset of the top and bottom pots of \(\pm 10\mu\)m may occur. The symmetry request reduces the number of combinations for stations mis-aligned by \(\pm 10\mu\)m to 16. The procedure to evaluate the corresponding systematic uncertainty is the same as in the acceptance case, a maximum error is calculated for a coherent mis-alignment and an average from all combinations. The resulting uncertainty for the luminosity is given in Table 8.

It appears that the alignment is an essential element, which induces even if achieved at the challenging level of 10\(\mu\)m already a systematic uncertainty of 1% on the luminosity.

### Beam optics

The optical functions at the IP and at the Roman Pots are needed for the reconstruction of the \(t\)-spectrum according to eq. 11, where \(\beta\), \(\beta^{*}\) and the phase advance \(\Psi\) enter in the expression of \(L_{eff}=\sqrt{\beta\beta^{*}}\sin\Psi\). An uncertainty on any of the optical parameters induces subsequently an uncertainty on the \(t\)-spectrum and thereby on the fitted luminosity. The \(\beta\)-functions can be measured from tune shifts in the quadrupoles and it is anticipated that \(\beta^{*}\) can be determined with 1% relative uncertainty and \(\beta\) with a few percent. In practice a combined uncertainty on the product \(\beta\beta^{*}\) is assumed, and a realistic range spans from 2 to 5 %. In addition also the phase advance uncertainty has to be considered.

It can be measured rather precisely from a sufficiently large number of turns of the bunches. The experimental systematic uncertainty is determined as for the other cases by repeating the reconstruction with shifted optical parameters, the results are given in Table 9. The change of the \(\beta\)-function entails a distortion of the \(t\)-spectrum in particular at larger \(t\) and therefore the logarithmic fit with its extended fit range is more sensitive to this effect. As the product of \(\beta\beta^{*}\) enters as square root in \(L_{eff}\) the associated systematic uncertainty is only moderate and an uncertainty of 2% on the product can be tolerated. The reconstruction is more sensitive to the vertical components, where the parallel-to

\begin{table}

\end{table}
Table 8: Systematic uncertainties for the luminosity related to alignment.

point focusing occurs, since the vertical displacement receives a larger weight in the \(t\)-reconstruction than the horizontal.

### Detector resolution

A nominal spacial resolution of 21 \(\mu\)m is assumed for the detector, based on a full simulation, and a detector correction is derived and applied to the reconstructed \(t\)-spectrum for this resolution. The systematic uncertainty is obtained by increasing the detector resolution to a larger value, as it may arise from an unexpected performance degradation, while keeping the nominal detector corrections in the fit procedure.

The results for the luminosity uncertainty are given in Table 10. It turns out that the luminosity determination is rather stable under changes of the detector resolution, even a degradation of 30%, which can for sure be observed, would lead to a systematic uncertainty of only 0.3%. The current simulation set-up does not yet allow for sophisticated systematic studies, related to the details of the track reconstruction, and the result has to be taken with some care. In future with a full GEANT4 simulation at hands the expected performance should be verified.

### Background

As outlined in Chapter 3 the background, primarily accidental protons originating from beam-gas interactions, to be subtracted is determined from the data. This procedure is in principle free of systematic uncertainties, but the subtraction is not exact because of statistical fluctuations of the difference between the true irreducible background and the calculated background using symmetric events. The normalisation of the background is with about 140k events well determined, its statistical error is about 0.27 %. But in individual bins the fluctuations are larger and may entail a fluctuation of the fit value of the luminosity. This effect, which is of statistical nature, is estimated as follows. Several independent halo background samples of 3.151M events each were generated and passed through the analysis chain. The resulting true background was added to the signal, the calculated background

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline \(\Delta L\) & lin. fit & log. fit \\ \hline \(\sigma\) = 25\(\mu\)m & \(\pm\)0.1\% & \(\pm\)0.1\% \\ \(\sigma\) = 30\(\mu\)m & \(\pm\)0.29\% & \(\pm\)0.16\% \\ \(\sigma\) = 35\(\mu\)m & \(\pm\)0.35\% & \(\pm\)0.19\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

was subtracted and the luminosity was determined using the nominal fit procedure. For each sample the difference between the actual fit result and the result without background was recorded. Finally the RMS of these values (one per sample), reflecting the statistical precision of the procedure, was calculated and assigned as systematic uncertainty for the background subtraction. The resulting background uncertainty is given in Table 11.

For the logarithmic fit the uncertainty is slightly larger because its fit range extents to smaller \(t\)-values, were background contribution and defects in the subtraction procedure are more prominent. It is questionable whether this uncertainty is to be counted as systematic or statistic. It should further be noted that the overall background normalisation depends strongly on the dynamic gas pressure, which is presently difficult to calculate and must be confirmed at the start-up of the LHC. Furthermore, another background component stemming from near inelastic beam-gas interactions or collimator scattering both resulting in hadronic showers are not taken into account in the present simulation. According to [9] this is not a big effect, but it should be verified in the future.

### Summary

To summarise all systematic effects obtained under the current best estimate of the input uncertainties are listed in Table 12. The total systematic uncertainty is the quadratic sum of the individual components and total error includes also the statistical component.

In the case of the optical functions the values given in Table 12 are the quadratic sum of the \(x\)- and \(y\)-components. The total experimental uncertainty is about 2.5% and the total error about 3%.

## 5 Conclusions

A simulation set-up for the calibration of the absolute luminosity using elastic _pp-_scattering in the Coulomb region at the LHC with the ALFA detector has been developed. This set-up allows the evaluation of the performance of the experimental method, and has been used to estimate the experimental uncertainties.

For a statistics of 10M accumulated events corresponding to about 100 hours of running at average luminosity of \(10^{27}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) with special beam conditions a statistical uncertainty of 1.8% is obtained. The experimental systematic uncertainties take the beam divergence, crossing angle, acceptance, alignment, optical functions and detector resolution into account. The dominant source of uncertainty is originating from the alignment, the optical function and the background subtraction and in total a systematic error of about 2.5% is achieved, yielding a total error of about 3%. With the current level of sophistication of the simulation it is verified that the precision required by the ATLAS experiment of 2-3% on the luminosity can be achieved. Further refinements in the future should concentrate on a full GEANT4 description of the detector for a better estimation of the detector performance and a completion of the background studies by near beam-gas or beam-collimator interactions producing hadronic showers in the detector.
