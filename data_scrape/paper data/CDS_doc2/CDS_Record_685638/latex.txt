The calibration of the radial uniformity of the Spanish Fan endcap has been studied. The modulation generated by the high voltage distribution used is small and does not need any correction. The corrections on energy reconstruction come primarly from clustering. We show that by using the large rate of decays \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) any remaining radial non uniformity can be controlled with an accuracy of about 0.3% after one running day at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

Introduction

The "Spanish Fan" [1] is an "accordion" endcap electromagnetic calorimeter designed to be \(o\) symetric while keeping the sampling fraction and the calorimeter density constant with the radius. Consequently the argon gap varies with the radius and as a fast shaping is used the collected charge will depend on radius if constant electric field is used. To correct this effect a discrete high voltage distribution, by step of one or two cells, will be applied. In the first part of this note we will show that the residual effects of such a discrete high voltage distribution are negligible and will not affect the uniformity response of the calorimeter. The effects of clustering in the endcap will also be described : a tradeoff between the cell size and the pile up contribution to the resolution should be found depending on the luminosity. In the second part we demonstrate that using the large rate of \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\epsilon^{+}e^{-}\) in the endcap the high voltage and cluster effects can be under control in situ with the necessary level of accuracy.

## 2 Description of the simulation and comparison with RD3 data

For CPU time reasons and as it was not crucial for this analysis we have not used GEANT simulation but a fast and simplified simulation with some analytical distribution probabilities in order to reproduce the lateral but not the longitudinal electromagnetic showers development. After having described the procedure the simulated events will be compared with the RD3 data.

### Fast analytical simulation

The lateral energy deposit is described by the following function already used in the NA31 experiment :

\[\frac{dE}{dxdy}=\alpha\frac{E}{\pi}\frac{{\lambda_{1}}^{2}}{{(x^{2}+y^{2}+{ \lambda_{1}}^{2})}^{2}}+(1-\alpha)\frac{E}{\pi}\frac{{\lambda_{2}}^{2}}{{(x^{ 2}+y^{2}+{\lambda_{2}}^{2})}^{2}}\]

The three coefficients \(\lambda_{1}\), \(\lambda_{2}\) and \(\alpha\) have been tuned by adjusting the energy containment in a nonet, in a \(25^{nplet}\) and the mean value of the cluster width. The first member of the formula decribes the core of the shower and the second member the tails.

In order to introduce energy resolution (sampling term) and lateral fluctuations of shower the following procedure is used to generate an event [2]:

* Assuming a sampling term of 10%, we generate a number of hits, N, such as \[\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}=\frac{\sigma_{N}}{N}=\frac{\sigma_{E}}{E}=\frac{10\%}{ \sqrt{E}}\]
* In order to take the lateral fluctuations of the showers into account we generate a scale factor \(\beta\) around 1 with \(\sigma=0.04\).
* For each event we generate the position of the hits according to the previous formula and then replace \(x\) and \(y\) by \(R.x\) and \(R.y\). The calibration constant for a hit is by definition \(N/E=0.010~{}GeV\).

A sample of about \(10^{4}\) electrons of 100 GeV have been generated with this procedure.

### Comparison with RD3 data

In order to compare our simulation with the RD3 data we have used the granularity of the RD3 barrel prototype, that is to say a cell size of \(2.7\times 2.7~{}cm^{2}\). In the table 1 are compared the energy in a nonet, a \(25^{nplet}\), the cluster width and the r.m.s of that distribution for the best simulation parameters (the cluster width is computed in a nonet).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & RD3 data & Simulation \\ \hline \% of energy in a nonet & 93.20 & 93.37 \\ \hline \% of energy in 5 \(\times\) 5 & 98.36 & 98.23 \\ \hline Mean value of cluster width (cell unit) & 0.4110 & 0.4195 \\ \hline r.m.s of cluster width (cell unit) \(\times 10^{-1}\) & 0.098 & 0.103 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 1 : Comparison between simulation and RD3 data

From these values we can conclude that our simulation is in agreement with the RD3 data. The distribution of the energy deposited in a nonet and the cluster width are shown in figure 1. As expected the energy resolution for 100 Gev electrons is about 1%

## 3 Effect of high voltage distribution

Using the previous electron sample we have introduced the dependence of the energy versus radius coming from the high voltage distribution. After having described the endcap geometry used, we will expose this study and the result on uniformity.

### Endcap description

The spanish fan consists in two concentric wheels. The first wheel extends from inner radius of 40 cm to an external radius of 84 cm which is equivalent to a \(\eta\) coverage of 2.89 to 2.16. The granularity is \(\delta\eta\times\delta\phi=0.03\times 0.052\) so that 24 cells will be used in \(\eta\) direction. The liquid argon gap (between an electrode and an absorber) varies from 1.709 mm at R=40 cm to 2.317 mm at R=84 cm as shown on figure 2. In the second wheel the \(\eta\) range goes from 2.16 to 1.45 that is to say from 84 cm to 195 cm. The granularity is \(\delta\eta\times\delta\phi=0.026\times 0.026\) as in the electromagnetic barrel so that 30 cells will be defined in

Figure 1: _Distribution of energy in a nonet and cluster width (simulation)_\(\eta\) direction. As shown in figure 2 the gap variation is the same as in the small wheel but over a larger radius. By construction the endcap should not present inhomegeneities in the \(\phi\) direction except the known modulation due to the accordion structure inside each cell.

### Simulation of the high voltage distribution

As the collected signal is proportional to \(V_{D}/g\) where \(V_{D}\) is the drift velocity and \(g\) the argon gap, and as the gap increases with the radius, the drift velocity, or the electric field, has to increase with the radius in order to keep the ratio constant. The following linear relation which has been used between the electric field and the drift velocity is a good approximation of the exact dependence in the region of high voltage used [3]:

\[V_{D}(mm/ns)=2.33\times 10^{-3}+0.17\times 10^{-3}\times E(kV/cm)\]

By extrapolating some results obtained with full Geant simulation (charge collection included) the expression of the high voltage needed in order to have uniform signal has been

Figure 2: _Gap variation versus the radius in the two wheels_

parametrized [4]. The figure 3 shows the distribution of high voltage, electric field and drift velocity in the inner wheel.

Assuming this dependence, the local effect of discrete high voltage distribution can be estimated. For example on figure 4 is presented the variation of the local collected signal as a function of radius when the cells are paired by 2 at the same high voltage. The signal variation is less than \(\pm 2\%\) over the full range. Moreover for an electromagnetic shower this effect should be smaller because we integrate over the shower lateral size.

In figure 5 is shown the energy measured in the full calorimeter in the case of a continuous high voltage distribution and in the case of 12-fold high voltage distribution in the small wheel. Same figure is shown in the large wheel with a 30-fold high voltage distribution. As expected the high voltage distribution introduces an oscillation of the response versus the radius. The constant term induced by this modulation has been computed in different cases which are summarized in the table 2.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & 1 cell / HV & 2 cells / HV \\ \hline Inner wheel & 0.04\% & 0.21\% \\ \hline Outer wheel & 0.07\% & 0.27\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 2 : Rms of the modulation due to high voltage distribution

Figure 3: _High voltage, electric field and drift velocity variation versus the radius in the inner wheel_

In the small wheel, where will be used a 12-fold high voltage distribution, the residual modulation is about 0.2%. Moreover it should be noticed that by applying different software calibration constants for the even and odd cells this modulation could be reduced to the level of the modulation of the 24-fold high voltage distribution. In the large wheel a cell by cell high voltage can be used so that residual modulation will be less than 0.1%. From these results we conclude that such an effect does not need corrections and would not dominate the constant term.

## 4. Effect of finite cluster size in the endcap

In the previous chapter, we have considered the effect of the high voltage distribution on collected energy in the full calorimeter. This is an ideal approach but in reality the energy will be measured in clusters of fixed sizes in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) in order to minimize the contribution of the pile-up. Clustering effects on energy reconstruction and energy resolution have been studied.

### Energy reconstruction

Three effects can induce an energy reconstruction dependence as a function of the radius :

- A fixed \(\delta\eta\times\delta\phi\) cluster size in the endcap means that the physical cluster area is strongly dependent on the radius. For example in the inner wheel the size of a cell is about \(1.2\times 2.1\ cm^{2}\) at R = 40 cm but \(2.4\times 4.4\ cm^{2}\) at R=84 cm. As a consequence of this purely geometric effect the energy containment varies with the radius. In the small wheel the relative energy variation is about 10%.

- The second effect is also geometric and well known. The energy measured in a cluster whose area does not contain the full shower varies with the impact point inside the

cell. The amplitude of this effect is around 2% over a cell. This effect exists also in the barrel region and is usually corrected by a parabola. It should be noted that for all this study we have shot the electrons always at the centre of the cell in the \(\phi\) direction. The modulation in \(\phi\) direction has already been studied and from our experience with the data taken in the barrel we know that the residual combined effect of these two corrections is at the level of 0.2%.
* The last effect comes from the high voltage distribution described in the previous chapter which is, even when not corrected, below the two others.

On figure 6 are displayed the distribution of energy collected in the full calorimeter, in a nonet and a \(25^{uplet}\) for the two wheels, showing the two effects discussed above.

### Energy resolution

When the size of the cells start to be too small, the energy fluctuation from an event to another event becomes larger and the resolution will be deteriorated. Using ten samples of about 1000 electrons the energy resolution has been computed at various radii in the 2 wheels. As shown if figure 7 the resolution is worsened by 50% and 25% respectively in the inner and outer wheel in the case of a nonet reconstruction. The \(\delta\eta\) cell size choosen for this study in the inner wheel (0.03) is probably too small for a \(3\times 3\) reconstruction. A \(5\times 3\) cluster may be more appropriated or a larger \(\delta\eta\) size (0.05). Nevertheless it should

Figure 6: _Reconstructed energy in a nonet (full curve), a \(25^{uplet}\) (dashed curve) and full calorimeter energy (dotted curve)_

be reminded that at large \(\eta\) the dominant contribution to the energy resolution is not the sampling term but the pile up, not included in our analysis.

## 5 Calibration of the Endcap radius dependence with \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\)

Not with-standing the fact that all calibration constants and geometric effects will be intensively studied with test beams before installation of the Atlas detectors, a ckeck of the energy scale and uniformity during the LHC runs will be of prime importance. The large rate of \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events seems to be the best candidate. After having described the simulation used, we will present an estimation of the accuracy which could be reached on the radial energy calibration of the endcap in one running day at LHC at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

### Description of the \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events

The simulation of the \(Z^{0}\) production at LHC was done with Pythia 5.6 using the Drell-Yan process.A sample of about 55000 events forced to decay into \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs has been generated. Around 10% of this sample has the two electrons in the same endcap (5% in each of them). Assuming \(\sigma\times BR=1.15\ nb\)[5] the expected number of events produced in one day at a luminosity of \(10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) will be around \(10^{5}\). This means that each endcap collects in one day around 5000 such events. Putting together the \(z>0\) and \(z<0\) generated events in one endcap, our sample is equivalent to one running day.

Figure 7: _Energy resolution versus radius in the two wheels for 100 GeV electrons_

### Energy reconstruction

First for each event the longitudinal position of the vertex decay is smeared assuming a vertex accuracy of 5.6 cm and the impact point of each electron in the calorimeter is determined. With the method used in the first chapter, the energy deposit of each electron has been simulated. In order to be more conservative the sampling term used was 12% instead of 10%. The energy of each electron is reconstructed using clusters defined by a nonet. The invariant mass of the two electrons at this level is presented on figure 8 : the distribution is very broad and the energy scale clearly too low. By fitting the energy dependence of the nonet reconstruction already shown (Fig 6), a correction function has been extracted and is applied to each cluster leading to the energy \(E^{C}\). This correction is not optimized and just a first approximation. After this correction the obtained invariant mass is also shown in figure 8.

### Fit procedure

In order to estimate the accuracy we can reach on radial energy calibration, we need to constrain the invariant mass of the two leptons to the nominal \(Z^{0}\) mass. For that purpose the following chisquared has been constructed :

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\left(m_{Z^{0}}-m_{12}\right)^{2}}{{\sigma_{m}}^{ 2}}\]

where :

\(-\quad m_{Z^{0}}=91.17\ GeV/c^{2}\) is the nominal \(Z^{0}\) mass.

Figure 8: _Reconstructed invariant mass of the 2 leptons from the generated energies (full curves), from the raw cluster energies (dashed curve) and from the energies corrected for cluster effects (dotted curve)._We perform a sum over some selected events : the electrons should not have their impact point in a cell near the border of the wheels (for such events a careful reconstruction will be needed) and the invariant mass of the two electrons from the generated energies should be in the range \(m_{Z^{0}}\pm 5~{}GeV/c^{2}\).
* \(m_{12}\) is the invariant mass of the 2 electrons. The energy dependence of the electron has been parametrized with a quadratic form in each of the two wheels : \[E=E^{C}\times(\alpha+\beta r_{n}+\gamma r_{n}^{2})\] \(E^{C}\) is the reconstructed cluster energy, \(r_{n}\) is a normalised variable defined by \[r_{n}=2\times\frac{R-R_{e}}{R_{out}-R_{in}}\] \(R_{e}\) is the radius at the center of the wheel and \(R_{in}\) and \(R_{out}\) the inner and extern radius of the considered wheel.
* \(\sigma_{m}=\sqrt{\sigma_{i}^{2}+\sigma_{r}^{2}}\) is the resolution on the invariant mass. The first term comes from the intrinsic width of the \(Z^{0}\) (we have used \(1.85~{}GeV/c^{2}\) wich is the width of the associated gaussian adjusted on the \(Z^{0}\) distribution in the range used). The second term \(\sigma_{r}\) comes from resolution on mass reconstruction. \[\sigma_{r}=\frac{m_{12}}{2}\left(\left(\frac{0.12\times d_{1}}{\sqrt{E_{1}}} \right)^{2}+\left(\frac{0.12\times d_{2}}{\sqrt{E_{2}}}\right)^{2}\right)^{ \frac{1}{2}}\] \(d_{1}\) and \(d_{2}\) are the function of the radius which takes into account the fact that the nonet energy resolution is not uniform with the radius as already shown in figure 7.

### Results

The \(\chi^{2}\) has been minimized in various cases :

* case 1 : all the events are used, that is to say after fiducial cuts and mass cut a sample of 3677 events.
* case 2 : only events after cuts with the two leptons in the small wheel are used. (856 events)
* case 3 : only events after cuts with the two leptons in the large wheel are used. (1000 events)

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & case 1 & case 2 & case 3 \\ \hline Inner wheel \(\alpha\) & \(0.9991\pm 0.0008\) & \(0.9997\pm 0.0010\) & --- \\ \hline Inner wheel \(\beta\) & \((0.27\pm 0.13)\%\) & \((0.19\pm 0.18)\%\) & --- \\ \hline Inner wheel \(\gamma\) & \((0.11\pm 0.20)\%\) & \((0.18\pm 0.27)\%\) & --- \\ \hline Outer wheel \(\alpha^{\prime}\) & \(1.0013\pm 0.0009\) & --- & \(1.0005\pm 0.0009\) \\ \hline Outer wheel \(\beta^{\prime}\) & \((-0.41\pm 0.14)\%\) & --- & \((-0.42\pm 0.19)\%\) \\ \hline Outer wheel \(\gamma^{\prime}\) & \((-0.07\pm 0.26)\%\) & --- & \((0.14\pm 0.35)\%\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 3 : Results of radial uniformity check.

These results are summarized in the table 3 where the errors quoted are pessimistic because they do not include the correlations between parameters. The fact that these three fits give compatible results means there exists no systematic bias when all events are used. As we have not optimized the cluster energy correction it is not surprising to observe constant terms different of unity and some slopes or quadratic terms.

The errors are smaller in the first case where the full statistic is used. The correlations between the parameters of the two wheels are small (\(\sim 2\%\)) and can be neglected. On the other hand inside a wheel the correlations are much stronger and have been taken into account to quote the error on the uniformity check. On figure 9 is presented the accuracy obtained ( \(\pm 1\sigma\)) for the uniformity check versus the radius (To make the picture easy to understand we have choosen to present the errors in a case where no slope and quadratic terms exist). The accuracy on energy measurement is larger on the edges of the wheel but does not go beyond \(0.3\%\) or \(0.4\%\) in one running day at LHC at low luminosity.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & case 1 & case 2 & case 3 \\ \hline Inner wheel \(\alpha\) & \(1.0090\pm 0.0010\) & \(1.0087\pm 0.0013\) & — \\ \hline Inner wheel \(\beta\) & \((1.28\pm 0.13)\%\) & \((1.21\pm 0.18)\%\) & — \\ \hline Inner wheel \(\gamma\) & \((-0.84\pm 0.24)\%\) & \((-0.82\pm 0.34)\%\) & — \\ \hline Outer wheel \(\alpha^{\prime}\) & \(0.9912\pm 0.0010\) & — & \(0.9907\pm 0.0013\) \\ \hline Outer wheel \(\beta^{\prime}\) & \((-1.40\pm 0.14)\%\) & — & \((-1.42\pm 0.20)\%\) \\ \hline Outer wheel \(\gamma^{\prime}\) & \((0.96\pm 0.26)\%\) & — & \((1.11\pm 0.38)\%\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}.

\end{table}
Table 4: Results of radial uniformity fit when are imposed extra dependences (see text)

Figure 9: _Accuracy (\(\pm 1\sigma\)) on energy calibration in one running day at low luminosity_

Some checks have been done to control the stability and convergence of the fit. For example in table 4 are shown the result when we impose some extra dependences with respect to the one already existing. We have choosen \(\alpha=1.01,~{}J=0.01,~{}\gamma=-0.01,~{}\alpha^{\prime}=0.99,~{}J^{\prime}=-0. 01,~{}\gamma^{\prime}=+0.01\). As expected we found as results the combined effect of the previous results (table 3) and of the extra parameters, that gives us good confidence in our procedure.

## 6 Conclusion

The effects generated by a discreet high voltage distribution have been studied and appear to be small and do not need corrections. The variations of energy reconstruction versus radius because of clustering are much stronger and will deteriorate the energy resolution at a level which seems acceptable. Indeed at large rapidity the dominant contribution to the resolution comes from pile up. By using the large rate of decays \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\), the radial response uniformity can be checked during the LHC data taking. In one running day at a luminosity \(10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) an accuracy of 0.3% can be achieved in each endcap.
