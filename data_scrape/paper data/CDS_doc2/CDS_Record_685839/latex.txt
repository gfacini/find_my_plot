## 1 Introduction

**This note discusses a number of technical aspects of the current tracker designs (as defined in Eagle-note INDET-NO-001), with respect to the Micro Strip Gas Counters. We will follow the list of topics suggested by David Saxon in the Eagle inner tracker meeting of 20 January, 1992:**

* **General layout (number of channels, positions, occupancy, ambiguities)**
* **Performance and optimisation**
* **Readout strategy**
* **Mechanical support; services needs (cables, cooling etc.)**
* **Material vs. rapidity and radius**
* **Assumed radiation tolerance and estimated lifetime**
* **Cost**
* **Milestones establish feasibility**

**We are not able to discuss all theses matters in great detail. It is especially very early to discuss services needs. This note is written in an intermediate stage of the MSGC development, and ideas presented here should be treated as such.**

General layout

**Three layouts will be discussed: the Reference, the Eagle-B and the Hollow Tracker. In INDET-NO-001 these inner trackers are described, and a first estimate for the momentum resolutions of these configurations is presented. The positions of the MSGC discs in these configurations are given in Table 1.**

### Channel count

**The number of channelsofa MSGC tracker depends on the tracker design and the solution we use to solve the problem of second coordinate readout. Concerning the last topic, our standard solution is to position two layers of MSGCs close together at a small stereo angle. Other options are to use pads (pick up signals on the back of the substrate), or not to read a second coordinate at all (which may lead to difficulties in pattern recognition and a less accurate measurement of \(p_{i}\) of low-\(p_{i}\) tracks). In principle, we need twice as many channels for a small stereo angle set up as for a tracker with poor \(r\) measurement: the number of space points does not increase if we use small stereo angles, only the accuracy of these points becomes better. In practice, we may be able to economize on the number of channels in a small angle stereo layout because of the larger redundancy in the hit information. This question should be solved by Monte Carlo studies. As a worst case approximation, we take a factor of 2 for the small stereo angle case. For pads, we use a factor of 1.2, based on the assumption that we will have 100 pads on a 512 channel detector.**

**Our detector prototypes are made on 10 \(\times\) 10 cm\({}^{2}\) substrates. In the outer regions of the tracking volume, an anode of 10 cm long will have an occupancy below 0.5%, which is to our opinion a reason to make longer strips and cover a larger area with one channel. To make a detector with strips of the order of 20 cm, one can either try etching on a larger substrate, or bond two anodes on different substrates together.**

**The number of channels of the three inner detector designs are listed in Table 2. Below is described how we arrived at these numbers for each of the three layouts of INDET-NO-001.**

**The Reference Tracker**

**In the Reference Tracker, the MSGCs are positioned in rings on wheels (see fig. 1). The strips point radially towards the beam axis. The inner radius of the smallest ring is 40 cm. The outer radius of the largest ring is 100 cm. The inner two rings have detectors with strips of 10 cm long. The outer two rings have detectors with 20 cm long strips. A wheel holds a total of 184 detectors of 512 strips i.e. 94.000 strips. The Reference Tracker has 26 wheels, i.e. 2.45 million strips.**

**The Eagle-B Tracker**

**Table 2: Number of channels for the three inner tracker designs and the three options of radial position measurement (in Mch.)**

In this layout MSGCs are only used to measure a few space points on a track beforehand after the TRD. Ten small wheels are positioned very close to the interaction vertex only containing one ring of detectors each. At bigger values of \(z\) the wheels will contain two rings, one with inner radius of 33 cm containing detectors with 5 cm strips and one with inner radius of 97 cm with 16 cm strips. At the end of the TRD there would be 4 full wheels such as the ones used for the Reference Tracker. Not much thought has gone into the detailed design of the wheels and the detectors, so we will calculate the number of channels here supposing a strip pitch of 200 \(\mu\)m at the inner radius of the wheels. The inner rings then have 2\(\pi\times\) 33/0.02=10.000 strips. There are 58 of such rings i.e. 600.000 strips. The 60 outer rings have 60 \(\times\) 2\(\pi\times\) 97/0.02 = 1.8 million strips. The 4 wheels (on both sides) at the end have 8 \(\times\) 94.000=750.000 strips bringing the total to 3.2 million channels.**

**The Hollow Tracker**

In this layout the TRD has been removed from the Eagle-B Tracker and the dimensions of the rings with MSGCs have slightly changed. The smaller rings now go from \(r\)=40 cm to \(r\)=50 cm and there are 29 of those on each side. The larger rings run from \(r\)=80 cm to \(r\)=100 cm and there are 19 of them. As in the TRD tracker there are 4 complete wheels at the end on each side. There is no detailed design for the MSGCs in this layout, so we can only give indicative numbers. If the inner rings would hold strips of 10 cm long and with 200 \(\mu\)m pitch therew would fit 2\(\pi\times\) 40/0.02=12.500 strips on a wheel. This would mean 2 \(\times\) 29 \(\times\) 12.500=730.000 for all small rings. If the outer rings would hold strips of 20 cm long and with a 200\(\mu\)m pitch at a radius of 80 cm this would mean 2\(\pi\times\) 80/0.02=25.000 strips per outerring. For the all outer rings this yields 2 \(\times\) 19 \(\times\) 25.000=955.000 strips. The wheels at the end have again 750.000 strips making a total of 2.45 million strip channels for the whole detector.**

### Occupancies

The occupancy of the anode strips will be highest at small radii. We took as an example the Hollow tracker and counted the number of hits in a detector positioned between \(r=40\) and \(r=50\) cm. The pitch of the anode strips was taken to be 200 \(\mu m\). We overlapped 20 minimum bias events (generated according to the Di Ciaccio tuning of Pythia as defined in Aachenproc. Vol. III page 155), assumed that each crossing particle would occupy two anode strips, took a dead time of 32 ns, and arrived at anoccupancy curve as shown in fig. 2. This graph is in good agreement with earlier calculations showing that the maximum occupancy of an anode strip will be around 1%. This gives us confidence that the problems associated with ambiguities are at tolerable level.

Performance optimisation of the MSGC

### Suitable drift gases

Recently we completed an investigation into gases suited for operation of an MSGC (see NIM A313 (1992) 377). The conclusion of this study was, that a mixture of CO2 and DME is most suited as it has high primary ionization and a low ratio of drift velocity and drift field, leading to a low Lorentz angle. At electric fields of 8 - 10 kV/cm the electron drift velocity can be as high as 70 \(\mu\) m/ns.

In the MSGCs in the forward region of an Eagle inner tracker, the magnetic field is parallel to the drift field of the detector. For the drifting electrons the Lorentz angle is not important in this case, so we could make use of mixtures containing CF4 (to increase the drift velocity). A systematic study of this gas with respect to MSGC response and radiation hardness may lead to even better candidate mixtures.

### Construction

Much work needs to be done to arrive at a light and reliable construction of the counter. Currently at NIKHEF a twin counter is being designed with two layers mounted with a small stereo angle between the strips.

## 4 Readout strategy

### Assumptions

In this section, we assume the following:

* 5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{6}\) measuring channels, delivering binary data
* 500 channels per detector ( => 10\({}^{4}\) detectors)
* Occupancy on average 1%
* Pipeline-buffer on detector
* Readout rate > 50 kHz

Reading out 500 bits per detector with an average rate of 50 kHz (= level 1 trigger rate) means a total data rate of 50 \(\times\) 10\({}^{3}\)\(\times\) 10\({}^{4}\)\(\times\) 500 = 2.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{11}\) bit/s = 31.3 Gbyte/s. Assume that this has to be entered into memories with 100 MByte/s transfer capacity. To accomplish this 313 memory modules would be required, assuming that readout of the memories is already taken into account in the transfer capacity. Conclusion: sparse readout is desirable!

### A simple scheme for sparse readout

Readout with zeros suppression could be implemented as follows. Increment a 9-bit counter for each of the 500 bits stored in the pipeline-buffer of detector. If the output of the preamp/discriminator of a strip is 1, send the contents of the counter via a serial connection, otherwise do not send. Now only the non-zero bits are read. With an occupancy of 1% this gives a reduction of a factor of 100. However now 9 bits have to be read for each non-zero channel, leaving a total reduction of roughly a factor 10. Hence the data output of a 5 \(\times 10^{6}\) channel detector is 3.13 GByte/s and we could use 32 memory modules (in principle). The data flow over 10\({}^{4}\) connections, each carrying 3.13 / 10\({}^{4}\) GByte/s = 313 kByte/s. A 100 MBit/s = 12.5 MByte/s connection can be realized (e.g. with an optical fiber driven by a LED), so that 40 connections in principle can be multiplexed onto one link. This leaves us with 250 links coupled to 32 modules: 8 links per module. To distinguish the 8 (2\({}^{3}\)) links into the module internally in the module 3 more bits per data word are needed, bringing the total of bits per dataword up to 12. If in the whole readout 32 (2\({}^{5}\)) of such modules are necessary a hit will eventually consist of 17 bits. Multiplexing several connections onto one link can be done using a token passing protocol.

### Deadtime

With the scheme described above, readout of one event takes on average 20\(\mu s\). If the pipeline buffer can store a second event the dead time may be acceptable; otherwise additional buffering on the detector has to be added, or the readout time per event has to be reduced by reading out less than 40 detectors via one link.

### Preliminary conclusion

The following conclusions can be drawn:

* we have to apply "on-detector" zero suppression;
* we could use token-passing networks for readout;
* 64 memory processor modules are needed receiving data from the 500 token-passing networks;
* 1905?) would be ideal as a processor, because of its shared memory implementation (each processor can look in the memory of any other processor connected to it).

## 5 Mechanical support and services needs

**At this very early design stage we think it is inappropriate to discuss in any detail the services needed. To give a global idea of the uncertainties encountered: estimates for the power dissipation of a preamplifier for a MSGC vary from 300 \(\mu W\) to 3 \(mW\). If indeed the power dissipation is as low as 300 \(\mu W\) per channel, sufficient local cooling can be reached by convection, with thermal contact to some outer cylinder where global cooling takes place. If, on the other hand, the front-end electronics dissipate 3 \(mW\) per channel, a more local water cooling seems necessary.**

**The mechanical support structure (wheel) is under design. Various wheel designs are being simulated with finite element calculations. Our basic aim is to design a wheel which does not introduce more than 0.5% X\({}_{0}\) of material on average, and still have it intrinsically stable up to the tolerances required.**

## 6 The amount of material vs. rapidity and radius

**A forthcoming Eagle note is dedicated to the subject of material versus \(\eta\) and \(r\) for all subdetectors in the three Eagle tracking options. For all details we refer to this note. The MSGCs are assumed to be 0.7% X\({}_{0}\) thick each in case of a single-layer, or 1% X\({}_{0}\) per double-layer (with small stereo angle), which includes support, cooling etc. This number is based on the thickness of one glass substrate, \(\leq\) 0.24% X\({}_{0}\). For arangle of incidence, (stiff) particles from the vertex will therefore cross less than 8% X\({}_{0}\) in total, in all three tracker options.**

## 7 Radiation hardness

**An experimental programme to determine the performance of MSGCs under high rate and radiation conditions has been started in October, 1991. The MSGCs are to survive 10 years of running (taking 10\({}^{7}\) seconds per year) at a radius of 40 cm and a luminosity of 2 \(\times\) 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\). We can expect a 300 kHz count rate per 10 cm long anode strip (corresponding to 1% occupancy with 30 ns gating) and with an average charge collection of 12000 e\({}^{-}\) per crossing particle per anode (since the charge will spread out over 2 anodes), this leads to an integrated charge of 6 mC/cm over these 10 years of running.**

**In a test performed in the beginning of this year we exposed a MSGC over a time period of 2 weeks locally up to 0.8 mC/cm over a surface of 3 cm\({}^{2}\). The anode and cathode strips were aluminum, and the drift gas wasour standard drift gas DME/CO\({}_{2}\) 60/40. During the test, a gain drop (factor 10) occurred, but no significant damage to the strips was observed. After irradiation, a thin deposit was found on the strips. The composition of this deposit is under analysis. Wehave started to systematically change some relevant parameters (strip material, gas composition).
