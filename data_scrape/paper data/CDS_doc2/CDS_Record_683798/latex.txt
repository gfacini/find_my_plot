###### Abstract

In this short report we summarize a first analysis on how muon can be identified by exploiting fully the TileCal longitudinal segmentation.

After a short description of the geometry and readout scheme of the detector, we analyse its response to single, isolated muon. This allow to define a simple algorithm to tag muon. This algorithm is tested with fully simulated data.

The tag efficiency and the fake muon rate are such to suggest that already this simple method can be implemented in a LVL 2 trigger, where the digitized TileCal data are fully available to tag muons of momenta larger than 3 GeV.

The TileCal geometry

The Tile Calorimeter has a cylindrical shape 12.2 m long with outer radius of 4.23 m and inner radius of 2.28 m (Fig. 1) TileCal is located just outside the

LArg cryostat and inside the muon spectrometer. Azimuthally its structure is divided in 64 wedges. All the wedges are alike and their structure is displayed in Fig. 2. Here we can see that the cylinder is in fact divided in three coaxial cylinders (a Barrel and two Extended Barrels) separated by a gap of about 70 cm needed to accommodate the readout of LArg detectors and for the cryogenics. The gap is instrumented, in the space left free, with a plug calorimeter and a simple scintillator-iron slab.

In the present study we limit our analysis in the region \(\mid\eta\mid\leq 0.75\) to avoid the complicate geometry of the crack. We will consider the full TileCal acceptance in a later report.

Each of the wedges are subdivided in depth in three sections and the readout is arranged in quasi-projective towers (Fig. 2).

## 2 The muon signature

We expect that a high \(p_{\!T}\) muon will have a small energy loss nearly proportional to the amount of scintillator crossed by the particle. The energy deposit will also be contained in a narrow \(\Delta\eta\cdot\Delta\phi\) cone.

Figure 1: Artistic view of TileCal.

A muon of \(p_{T}\geq 3\) GeV will be curved in azimuth by the solenoid field but not enough to cross two wedges. We will limit our study to muon with \(p_{T}\leq 3\) GeV which have sufficient energy to cross fully TileCal. Therefore the azimuthal road will be one wedge.

In \(\eta\) the situation is a bit more complicated since a muon could cross two nearby \(\eta\)-towers (Fig. 2). These cases will be referred to as _split muon_.

A muon could be produced inside a jet or overlapped to a minimum bias event. In these cases the signature could be unclear because of the underlying event. Since we are interested mainly in \(b\overline{b}\) physics, our muon tagging algorithm must be solid enough to tag muons also in a hostile environment.

For what follows in this report the energy deposit in each TileCal depth will be denoted by \(E_{1}\), \(E_{2}\) and \(E_{3}\). One being the first depth, the nearest to the interaction region, 3 being the outer depth. It is intuitive that depth 3 will contain most of the information on the muon signature.

The two critical issues of our study are:

* How often a jet or a minimum bias event will mimic the pattern of energy deposit of a muon. (Fake muon triggers )
* How often the pattern of energy deposit will be blurred by an underlying jet or minimum bias event in a way that the muon do not pass the filter and is lost. (Lost muon )

The algorithm

To settle these questions we first study the response of Tile Cal to single muon. One thousand muons have been generated staring from the interaction region, uniformly distributed in azimuth and in the range \(|\eta|\leq\,0.75\). The interaction of a muon with ATLAS detector has been simulated with DICE 97 06 and reconstructed with ATRECON 141.

Fig. 6 shows the energy distribution in each depth for each tower.

The peaks at \(0.5,\,1.2\) and \(0.6\) GeV correspond to a muon well contained in a \(\eta\!-\!\phi\) tower. The large tails at very small energy deposit are due to muon that cross two towers and leave most of the energy in the nearby tower.

Fig. 4 shows the distribution of the sum of energies in each sample.

Based on these results we have decided the following strategy:

Figure 3: Response of TileCal to single, isolated muon in each depth.

* We consider a tower \(\Delta\eta\cdot\Delta\phi=0.1\)x0.1 which is the basic trigger tower defined in the hardware.
* We require \(0<E_{3}\leq 1.5\) GeV. The third depth is the one which contain most of the information on the muon signature. The low energy tail of a jet, leaking in \(E_{3}\) could fit in this energy window. For this reason we require:
* \(0.<E_{2}\leq 2.7\) GeV. A low energy deposit in \(E_{2}\) by a jet should be incompatible with an appreciable energy deposit in \(E_{3}\).
* \(E_{1}>0\). Since a muon could be within a jet, we decided to make the minimum usage of the first depth.
* \(E_{1}+E_{2}+E_{3}\geq 0.2\) to eliminate he noise.

This algorithm is very simple and fast and should be adequate for a fast decision at LVL2. The precise values of the windows have been determined empirically by compromising between minimum probability for fake triggers and maximum efficiency in detecting real muons.

As we have already noticed, the cell geometry of TileCal can produce two

muon triggers in two nearby \(\eta\) towers. In the analysis we have to consider these cases and count it as one "split muon".

## 4 Data and Programs

We have used fully simulated events. Table 1 shows which data have been used in this analysis.

The fully simulated data have been processed with ATRECON 141. The energy deposit of all calorimeter cells together with the MonteCarlo event info (GKIN bank) were punt in an ntuple. The detailed analysis was done with PAW.

## 5 Single isolated muon

We have used single isolated muons to measure the efficiency of this method in an optimal situation. The next figure shows a typical pattern of energy deposit in TileCal.

It is interesting to note that in sample 3 the signal of the muon is clearly visible.

This sample of data contains muon and jets and it is interesting to check the efficiency of the algorithm in tagging muon and the rate of fake muon induced by the jet activity. The results are encouraging. Only 50 muons out of 456 muons generated and in the selected \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) range are lost:

\[\epsilon=\frac{50\;\mbox{lost}\;\mu}{456\;\mbox{generated}\;\mu}=(89\pm 1.5)\%\]

Also the probability of fake triggers, though larger that in the case of Minimum Bias events is not too large: in 57 cases of fake muon in 998 events:

Figure 5: Response of TileCal to single, isolated muon in each depth.

\[p_{f}=\frac{57\text{ fake }\mu}{998\text{ events}}=(5.7\pm 1)\%\]

The efficiency is the same as in the case of single, isolate muon proving that this algorithm is robust and rather insensitive to the underlying jet activity.

## 8 Conclusions

This study is still very preliminary and more checks are needed before we can draw solid conclusions. However, although the algorithm used to tag muons has not been optimized, it has given encouraging results. We believe that

a LVL2 trigger based on TileCal and suited to low \(p_{T}\) muon (\(3.\leq p_{T}\leq 6.\) GeV ) is possible.
