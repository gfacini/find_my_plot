technology leading to the expectation of advantages in cost and yield combined with improved performance in important properties.

Double sided detectors including their properties after irradiation with 2\(\times 10^{14}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) 24GeV protons are described in references [1] and [2].

Here the single sided p\({}^{+}\)n detectors including the irradiation results are presented. Concept and design are based on extensive simulations and experiences with the earlier double sided detectors.

## 2 p\({}^{+}\)n detectors: motivation and concept

In discussing motivation and concept reference to the ATLAS n\({}^{+}\)n option will be taken. The principal structures (strip region only) of the two options are shown in figures 1 and 2.

### The strip region

During irradiation the originally n-type bulk is transformed to effective p-type (due to the radiation induced creation of deep level acceptor type defects)1.

Figure 1: Wide gap topology of p\({}^{+}\)n binary detectors. The strip width (22\(\mu m\)) is small with respect to the pitch (80\(\mu m\)). All strips are read out. The effective bulk doping changes from n- to p-type after irradiation.

Figure 2: n\({}^{+}\)n binary detector with individual p-stop insulation. Each readout strip is surrounded by a electrically floating p-doped ring.

For the non-irradiated p\({}^{+}\)n detector the space charge region grows from the junction located at the strip side while for the n\({}^{+}\)n detector it starts from the large area backside diode junction. Before irradiation therefore the p\({}^{+}\)n detector can be operated partially depleted while for the n\({}^{+}\)n detector this is not possible due to electrical shortening of the strips by the undepleted bulk.

The situation after irradiation is not completely reversed. The difference lies in the fact that the non depleted type inversed bulk material becomes highly resistive [3], a fact which is understood by the creation of deep level acceptor type defects [4]. Thus holes created in the space charge region will stop at the edge of the undepleted region (which can either be considered as a bad conductor or a imperfect insulator) creating signals in the strips by induction. In principle therefore a type inverted p\({}^{+}\)n detector can be operated in partially depleted mode.

Turning now to the strip structure, both options use narrow strips, so as to reduce the total capacitive load seen by the amplifier. In the p\({}^{+}\)n version p\({}^{+}\) doped strips are separated by large gaps, while in the n\({}^{+}\)n version p-doped rings surrounding the n\({}^{+}\) strips ("individual p-stops") provide the electrical insulation between strips. Such an insulation is not necessary in the p\({}^{+}\)n version, where it is provided automatically by the always present positive oxide charge.

The necessity of the p-stops for the n\({}^{+}\)n option has several technological and functional disadvantages which are absent for the p\({}^{+}\)n version:

1. Complication in technology: one extra photolithographic step and one additional implantation are necessary
2. Increase of the capacitive load, as the gap region between strips is interrupted by floating conducting regions
3. Occurrence of a very large voltage drop in between readout strips and of large electric fields at the outer edge of the p-stops
4. Strong sensitivity to local errors in the production process resulting in narrow or touching n- and p-doped regions. Such errors very often will escape detection in preirradiation tests. They are expected to become effective only during irradiation, prone to cause fatal defects

### The edge region

Considering the situation before irradiation, n\({}^{+}\)n detectors need structuring on both sides of the wafer, as the backside diode must not extend into the heavily damaged cut region.

Detectors to be operated at high bias voltage, as is the case for strongly irradiated detectors, need provisions to guarantee a controlled voltage drop towards the cutting edge, so as to avoid electric breakdown. This can be accomplished by proper design of guard ring structures [5]. On n\({}^{+}\)n detectors these protection structures are provided on both sides of the detector, while on p\({}^{+}\)n detectors this is only done on the strip side. The explanation why such a device works also after strong irradiation is given in references [6] and [2]. It again is based on the low conductivity of type inverted silicon. p\({}^{+}\)n detectors therefore can be produced in a standard single sided process technology.

### The biassing method

Capacitively coupled readout requires biassing circuits for each individual strip. For the analog readout detectors, punch through biasing [7] has been chosen for reasons of simplicity and cost reduction. The standard method of using polysilicon resistors usually requires the additional steps of polysilicon deposition, two photolithographic steps and two implantations.

An alternative biassing method has been developed, which avoids the noise problems encountered with punch through biassing but still keeps almost all technological simplifications obtained with this concept. Biassing is done through the bulk by means of implanted resistors. No additional photolithography is needed as it can be combined with another step needed anyway for providing good strip to implant integrity.

## 3 Detector layout and technology

Detectors were designed for the ATLAS barrel geometry using implanted bias resistors in half of the area and polysilicon resistors in the other half.

Important geometrical and technological parameters of the chosen p\({}^{+}\)n detector prototypes are shown in table 1.

The layout has been chosen so as to assure moderate electric field strength throughout the irradiation scenario in the experiment. Keeping the field strength as low as possible is important, since imperfections of technology and crystal defects can result in local breakdown much below the onset of avalanche multiplication in a perfect structure.

That this is easier to achieve in the p\({}^{+}\)n option is demonstrated in a comparative simulation of the potential distribution in the strip region for the two options shown in figure 3. The geometry of table 1 has been assumed for an irradiated detector with a saturated oxide charge density of N\({}_{\rm ox}\)=1.5\(\times\)10\({}^{12}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) and a radiation induced effective doping density N\({}_{\rm eff}\)=-6\(\times\)10\({}^{12}\)cm\({}^{-3}\) leading to a full depletion voltage (of a planar diode) of 350V. The devices were assumed to be operated at 400V bias. One notices the strong surface potential drop in the gap region of \(\approx\)100V for the n\({}^{+}\)n detector compared to only 14V in case of the p\({}^{+}\)n device, where it is limited by the oxide flat band voltage. Correspondingly higher is the electric field strength which for the n\({}^{+}\) version has its maximum at the outer edge of the insulation structure (at x=19 and 61 \(mu\)m), while for the p\({}^{+}\)n version it is at the strip edge (at x=11 and 69 \(\mu\)m).

For the p\({}^{+}\)n detector, breakdown in the strip region is not a major problem. The region most prone to breakdown is the edge region of the detector where one has to provide Figure 3: Equipotential line plot for p\({}^{+}\)n (left) and n\({}^{+}\)n (right) detectors after strong irradiation resulting in N\({}_{\rm eff}\)=-6\(\times\)10\({}^{12}\)cm\({}^{-3}\) and N\({}_{\rm ox}\)=1.5\(\times\)10\({}^{12}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) operated at 4 00V bias. The simulation region extends from the center of one strip to the center of the following strip (80 \(\mu\)m horizontal scale) and 80 \(\mu\)m into the depth. Strip edges are at 11 and 69 \(\mu\)m.

a controlled potential drop between strip region and backside bias, thus avoiding the occurence of high fields throughout the irradiation scenario. This has been accomplished by the introduction of 16 guard rings [5] with increasing gap widths going from inside to outside.

## 4 Detector properties before irradiation

A total of 16 detectors were produced at the MPI semiconductor laboratory, eight with implanted resistors and the same number with polysilicon resistors. The polysilicon processing was done at SINTEF using their standard process.

The description will be restricted to the the version with implanted resistors, as the polyresistor version was not ready in time for the irradiation test.

The current-voltage characteristics of all 8 unirradiated detectors (fig. 4) shows very low currents (well below 1\(\mu\)A for the 64\(\times\)63.6mm\({}^{2}\) device) up to large voltages. The rise to still low values of few \(\mu\)A disappears when keeping the bias on for prolonged time. This phenomenon is ascribed to the slow process of charging the uncovered oxide surface to an equilibrium value. All of the detectors could be biassed up to 1000V keeping the current still below 20\(\mu\)A.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline  & PROTOYTYPE p\({}^{+}\)n & BASELINE n\({}^{+}\)n \\ \hline \hline STRIP TOPOLOGY & & \\ \hline Readout pitch & 80 \(\mu\)m & 80 \(\mu\)m \\ Strip pitch & 80 \(\mu\)m & 80 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Strip width implant & 22 \(\mu\)m & 22 \(\mu\)m \\ Strip width metal & 16 \(\mu\)m & \\ Isolation stop width & & 18 \(\mu\)m \\ n-p gap & & 8 \(\mu\)m \\ p-p gap & & 6 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline \hline TECHOLOGICAL & & \\ \hline Wafer thickness & 280 \(\mu\)m & 280 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Dielectricum & double layer Si\({}_{3}\)N\({}_{4}\) on SiO\({}_{2}\) & \\ \hline Biassing (opt.1) & polysilicon resistors \(\approx 1M\,\Omega\) & \\ Biassing (opt.2) & implanted resistors \(\approx 1M\,\Omega\) & \\ \hline breakdown protection & 16 guard rings & \\ \hline photolithographical steps & 6 (poly resistors) & \(\approx\)12 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 4: Current voltage characteristics of all 8 unirradiated detectors with implanted resistors, measured at room temperature.

Figure 5: Separation of guard and strip region current of a particular detector.

As the bias ring and innermost guard ring can be contacted separately, it is possible to measure the current from the strip region and the edge region separately (figure 5). The edge generated current is of the order of one percent of the total detector current and the increase above 300V is due to the detector region.

Very high strip yield has been achieved with 99.3% percent for the worst and 100% for the best detectors. Measured were shorts between metal and implant at 50V stress and shorts to neighbours.

The capacitance to the four closest neighbours was measured to be between 0.8 and 0.9 pF/cm strip length. Adding 0.3 pF/cm for the backplane, the total strip capacitance is 1.1 to 1.2 pF/cm

## 5 Static detector properties after irradiation

Detectors were irradiated with 24 GeV protons up to a fluence of 2.1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)cm\({}^{-2}\). The detectors were kept cold (-7\({}^{0}\)C) and under 150V bias during irradiation. Measurements were done keeping detectors cold after irradiation, thus inhibiting both beneficial and reverse annealing and also after a short warmup period still insufficient for complete beneficial annealing.

Figure 6: Current voltage characteristics of the three irradiated p\({}^{+}\)n detectors directly after irradiation with 2.1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) 24GeV protons. The edge generated current (bottom part of the figure) could only be separately measured for two of them due to an electrical shortening produced during bonding

The current voltage characteristics measured before warmup (figure 6) shows identical behaviour of all three irradiated detectors. The edge generated current has risen close to the 10% level of the total current. It shows a kink slightly above 200V bias, whose origin so far is not explained.

The current voltage characteristics measured up to 700V of one detector with a narrow cutting distance of 0.9 mm from the strip ends (the other two detectors were cut at 1.4mm) is shown in figure 7. Perfectly stable behaviour is observed.

The functioning of of the guard ring structure which assures this stable behaviour is demonstrated in figure 8 where the dependance of the potential on individual guard rings on the bias voltage is measured. One notice a significantly larger potential drop between the two innermost guard rings than in the rest of the structure. Thus slight improvement of the structure is still possible.

The effect of a short warmup of the detector to room temperature is shown in figure 9. One notices the decrease of the total reverse bias current and also the near disappearance and shift to lower voltage of the step in the edge generate current.

The temperature dependance of the leakage current of the short time annealed detector is shown in figure 10.

A novel feature of the detectors is the use of of implants for forming bias resistors. That this can be done reliably is demonstrated in figure 11, where for all eight wafers processed the sheet resistance of the implants is plotted for two resistors on each wafer seperated over distances of more than 6 centimeters. Resistors measured on the same wafer in general lie on top of each other, so that they cannot always be distinguished in the plot and the spread of value between wafers with same implantation dose is small.

Figure 8: Potential of individual guard rings as function of the bias voltage. The largest potential drop occurs between the bias ring and the first guard ring (80V at V\({}_{\rm bias}\)=500V).

Figure 9: Current voltage characteristics of one irradiated p\({}^{+}\)n detectors directly after irradiation with 2.1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) 24GeV protons and after a 64 hour warmup to 23\({}^{0}\)C. The kink in the edge generated current (bottom part of the figure) is strongly reduced after annealing.

Figure 10: Temperature dependance of the total current of one p\({}^{+}\)n detectors after irradiation with 2.1\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) 24GeV protons and a 64 hour warmup to 23\({}^{0}\)C. Top part: iv characteristics measured at (from top to bottom) -6, -8, -10, -12 and -13.8\({}^{0}\)C. Bottom part: the logarithm of the current at V\({}_{\rm bias}\)=400V, normalized to the value -13.8\({}^{0}\)C is nearly linearly dependant on the inverse temperature, as is the case for the intrinsic carrier density (continuous line).

Figure 11: Sheet resistance of implanted resistors on all eight wafers produced. Resistors on wafers 1 to 4 were implanted with lower dose than wafers 5 to 8. The increase in resistance after irradiation has been measured for wafers 2 and 8. For the higher dose the resistance increases by roughly 20% due to irradiation resulting in a bias resistor of 1M\(\Omega\).

The resistance increases moderately with irradiation, for the higher doping concentration by \(\approx 20\%\) yielding a bias resistor of 1.05 M\(\Omega\) after irradiation.

### Signal and noise measurements of irradiated detectors

Signal and noise properties were investigated with unirradiated FELIX electronics [8] which was bonded to the detectors after the end of irradiation. This electronics has an intrinsic risetime of approximately 75ns and a built in feature of signal processing (deconvolution) making it possible to use effectively 25 ns shaping. Strips were connected in such a way as to study the situation with 6cm long strips corresponding to the use of a single detector and 12cm length corresponding to daisy chained detectors as foreseen for ATLAS modules. Signal measurements were performed with a beta source.

The detector has been kept cold during and after irradiation with the exception of an 8 hour warmup needed for bonding of the detector to the electronics. The signals are reconstructed forming a cluster consisting of the total charge in a maximum of five consecutive strips. Such a cluster is initiated by a seed of a strip with 4 \(\sigma\) signal and accepted when it has a total charge of at least five sigma above the average noise of the particular channels. A Landau distribution (convoluted with a Gaussian) is fitted to the obtained pulse height spectrum.

Cluster signal distributions and Landau fits are shown in figure 12 for 6 and 12cm strip region. Also shown in the figure are the individual strip noise values. Notice the very uniform noise values in the three regions of 6cm, 12cm and unbonded channels.

Signal and noise spectra obtained in "peak mode" corresponding to 75 ns shaping are shown as function of the bias voltage in figure 13. Full signal height on the not annealed detector is reached at 350V, measurements extend up to 600V. The S/N ratio in the saturation region is 26.5 for 6cm strips and 19 for the 12 cm region. Notice that the noise does not increase with overdepletion of the detector.

The same distribution for the case of 25ns shaping (deconvoluted mode) is shown in figure 14. The corresponding S/N ratio and efficiency dependance on the bias voltage in figure 15.

That the implanted resistors do not produce noise problems is not only demonstrated by the good signal to noise ratios but also by the independence of noise on the operating temperature and therefore also on the leakage current as seen in figure 16.

Important for the efficiency with single strip theshold electronics is the distribution of charge within a cluster. Figure 17 shows the ratio of the highest signal divided by the total signal in the cluster as function of the bias voltage. After irradiation this ratio is 76% in the saturation region, it drops gently with partial depletion.

Figure 12: Signal and and individual strip noise of an irradiated detector measured at -15\({}^{0}\)C. The leftmost 32 channels are bonded to 6cm strips, the following 64 channels to 12 cm strips and the rightmost 32 channels are unbonded. A few individual channel in the 12 cm region are masked, due to malfunctioning electronic channels.

Summary - conclusions

Single sided p+n detectors for the ATLAS SCT have been developed and built in the semiconductor laboratory of the Max-Panck Institutes in Munich. In their design emphasis was put on radiation tolerance and simplicity of technology, so as to allow simple cost effective production. They have been irradiated to a fluence close to the expected value within the ATLAS irradiation test program. All tests performed so far indicate that these detectors are adequate for use in the experiment.

A before untried feature is the use of implanted bias resistors which can be produced with little technological effort. These resistors perform well in all aspects: reproducibility, radiation resistance and noise properties before and after irradiation.

The considerably simpler technology and the much more favorably electric field configuration obtained in device simulations leads us to expect higher production yield, better testability and lower cost as compared to the n\({}^{+}\)n option.
