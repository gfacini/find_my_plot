**Dijet resonance searches with the ATLAS detector at 14 TeV LHC**

The ATLAS Collaboration

In view of the energy upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider, the reach of the search for resonances that decay into pairs of hadronic jets has been investigated. Smeared Monte Carlo truth-jets are used to perform sensitivity scans on benchmark models and set cross section limits with integrated luminosities up to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The results are compared to the published results of the Run-1 analysis. It is shown that 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) of 14 TeV collision data can provide limits competitive to 20 fb\({}^{-1}\) of 8 TeV collisions used for the current limits and 5 \(\sigma\) discovery potential for excited quarks up to \(\sim\)4 TeV and quantum black holes up to \(\sim\)7 TeV is obtained with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) data.

Introduction

After the Phase 0 upgrade, the center of mass energy of the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) will be raised to 13 TeV and subsequently to 14 TeV. This will allow higher masses to be reached and provide an increase of the signal cross sections for common benchmark models, such as excited quarks (q\({}^{*}\)) [1, 2] and Quantum Black Holes (QBH) [3, 4], that surpasses the backgrounds by an order of magnitude. This note presents the sensitivity improvement for dijet resonance searches in 14 TeV\(pp\) collision data recorded over the different LHC phases using the ATLAS detector for q\({}^{*}\) and QBH. However, since neither ATLAS performance nor exact LHC running conditions have been fully determined, these studies should only be considered as an indication of the discovery and sensitivity prospects of the searches.

This analysis applies the same selection and techniques in the existing ATLAS publication [5] to generated Monte Carlo (MC) events. Smearing factors, as evaluated in Ref. [6] for the ECFA upgrade studies, are used to reproduce the effects of detector and pile-up conditions on the detector measurements. The analysis strategy adopted is explained in Section 2. The simulation of signal and background and the event selection criteria are described in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. The extraction of the dijet mass spectrum from MC is explained in Section 5. Section 6 presents how the background is obtained from the dijet invariant mass distribution and how the search for local resonances is performed. The sensitivity to new physics benchmarks is detailed in Section 7. The expected limits on the benchmark models chosen and the systematic uncertainties considered are shown in Section 8.

## 2 Analysis strategy

At the LHC, \(pp\) collisions with the largest momentum transfer typically result in final states with two jets of particles with high transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)). The two leading jets in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) emerging from the collision are employed to determine the dijet invariant mass (\(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\)).

The dominant Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) interactions in this high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) scattering regime are \(t\)-channel processes leading to angular distributions peaking at small scattering angles. A number of new phenomena are expected to modify the central dijet mass distribution, creating an excess of events localized in mass (referred to as a "bump" or "resonance").

The expected background from Standard Model processes is determined by fitting the dijet mass spectrum with a smooth function. The _search phase_ consists in the determination of the compatibility between observed data and estimated background using a series of statistical tests. These tests are able to detect if an excess due to phenomena beyond the Standard Model is present.

If no new phenomena are found, constraints are set on various models pertaining to the dijet signature in the _limit setting phase_, using the same Bayesian techniques and tools used in Ref. [5].

## 3 Simulation

Background QCD events are produced at a center of mass energy of 14 TeV with the event generator Pythia[7] 8.183. The CT10 PDFs [8] are used with the set of parameters tuned to ATLAS underlying event data, called the _AU2_ tune [9].

Excited \(u\) and \(d\) quarks (q\({}^{*}\)) [1, 2], one possible manifestation of quark compositeness, are simulated using the Pythia 8.162 generator, using the CT10 PDFs and the AU2 tune. Excited quarks are assumed to decay to a quark and a gauge boson via gauge couplings set to unity, leading to a \(qg\) final state approximately 83% of the time (the remaining generated decays involve W/Z or \(\gamma\) emission), all decaysare considered in the search. A total of 12 signal mass points have been generated for the q*, ranging from 2 to 13.

A benchmark model for Quantum Black Holes (QBH) decaying to all allowed two-body final states is simulated using the BlackMax [3] generator. This produces a simple two-jet final-state scenario of quantum gravitational effects at the fundamental Planck scale with 6 extra spatial dimensions in the context of the ADD model [4]. The Planck scale is set equal to the threshold mass for the quantum black hole production. The PDF used for the generation and parton shower is CT10 and non-perturbative effects are simulated with 8.170 using the AU2 tune. In total, 9 signal mass points have been generated, ranging from 4 to 12.

The jets used for this study are reconstructed from applying the anti- jet algorithm [10, 11] to particles with a lifetime longer than 10 ps, excluding muons and neutrinos, and using a distance parameter. Jets are subsequently smeared according to the projected energy resolution due to detector effects and pile-up [6]. The parameterization of the jet energy resolution does not depend significantly on the pile-up conditions at the energies of the jets considered in this analysis. For this reason, a single value of the average interactions per bunch crossing () equal to 80 is used.

Mass spectra corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are randomly drawn from the distribution obtained from the smeared MC events (see Section 5). Sufficient Monte Carlo statistics are only available for integrated luminosities up to 25 fb\({}^{-1}\); results corresponding to larger integrated luminosities are obtained using pseudo-data drawn from a fit to the 25 fb\({}^{-1}\) spectrum.

## 4 Event selection

The leading jets must be found within and the next-to-leading jet is required to have a greater than 50 GeV. In 2012, this selection ensured that \(>\)98% of the two leading jets were associated with the hard-scatter collision vertex. Leading jets must have a rapidity in the center of mass frame,, smaller than 0.6.

No jet identification criteria are implemented for this study, as neither beam backgrounds nor detector effects are simulated. In Ref. [5], the kinematic selection above efficiently filtered out fake jets. Specific cleaning cuts [12] remove an additional 2% of events before the full kinematic selection, introducing a negligible inefficiency on real jets that is neglected both in Ref. [5] and the current analysis.

Trigger effects are considered to be negligible in these studies since the analysis is restricted to the high region () or depending on the integrated luminosity), where unprescaled triggers are expected to be fully efficient.

## 5 Dijet mass spectrum

The MC distribution is extracted using the _data-like method_, which can provide a spectrum with the statistical accuracy equal to that of observed data at a given integrated luminosity. The data-like method is based on the effective entries available in MC, which is the number of entries that would have the same statistical power if all entries had weight 1. For each bin, the number of effective entries is computed as:

(1)

where is the weight of the MC event. This would be identically equal to the number of entries if all were equal to 1. When the number of effective entries is greater than the number of weighted MC entries, it is possible to apply the data-like method, i. e. to randomly draw events and assign them a unit weight instead of using all the entries available but with a weight applied. A random number from a flat distribution in the range between 0 and 1 is compared to the ratio of the total number of weighted MC entries to the effective entries, \(r\), for each MC event. The event in question is accepted if the random number is less than \(r\). It is thus clear that the use of the method is limited by the number of entries of the MC sample. In performing luminosity scans the MC is integrated so as to simulate real data taking. As the luminosity increases, \(r\) approaches unity and a constant, bin-dependent seed for the random number generator ensures that once a MC event is selected, it is always selected for larger luminosities. Similarly to the MC QCD background, the signals to be injected are extracted using the data-like method.

## 6 Background estimation and search phase

The background distribution shape is extracted directly by performing a smooth function fit to the dijet mass distribution. This allows the search to be independent of theoretical uncertainties on the background Monte Carlo generation and detector smearing; the uncertainties involved are those on the functional form chosen and those on the parameters of the fit [5].

The background shape is extracted from the dijet mass spectrum with a four parameter function:

\[f_{4}(x)=p_{1}(1-x)^{p_{2}}x^{p_{3}+p_{4}\ln x} \tag{2}\]

where \(p_{i}\) are the parameters and \(x\) is defined as:

\[x\equiv\frac{m_{jj}}{\sqrt{s}} \tag{3}\]

Results have been cross-checked with a five parameter function:

\[f_{5}(x)=p_{1}(1-x)^{p_{2}}x^{p_{3}+p_{4}\ln x+p_{5}(\ln x)^{2}} \tag{4}\]

which has a similar form to Equation 2 but includes an additional term of \(x^{p_{5}(\ln x)^{2}}\).

Once the background shape is extracted, the BumpHunter algorithm [13] is then used to identify the bins in the \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) spectrum that are most discrepant from the fit. This is done by moving a variable sized search window over the entire \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) spectrum, looking for local excesses deviating from the fit. The size of the search window varies from two bins to as much as half the mass range1. A total of 10000 pseudo-experiments are thrown in order to determine the p-value associated with the deviation from the background. In case the p-value of the local excess is below 0.01, the fit is performed again excluding the excess region to avoid signal biases on the background estimation.

Footnote 1: The bin size is chosen to be higher than the detector resolution but smaller than the signal width.

Figure 1 shows two examples of search performed on a QCD background with a 6 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\)\(\mathrm{q}^{*}\) signal injected with 200 fb\({}^{-1}\) and a QCD background with a 10 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) QBH signal injected and corresponding to 500 fb\({}^{-1}\). The blue vertical lines delimit the the bins with the most significant excess.

## 7 Sensitivity to New Physics benchmarks

The sensitivity to resonant dijet signals is assessed for different integrated luminosities by injecting benchmark signals into the QCD background spectrum and performing the full search phase.

A search for localized excesses is performed on dijet mass spectra containing both signal and QCD background, generated as detailed in Section 5, for luminosity values ranging from 0.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). A potential discovery for a given mass point at a given luminosity is defined as a 5 \(\sigma\) BumpHunter deviation.

Figure 2 shows examples of luminosity scans for a q* of 6 and a QBH of 10 mass. The evolution of the local excess identified by the BumpHunter (represented by red points) and its corresponding p-value (represented by black points) are shown together as a function of the integrated luminosity until a 5 \(\sigma\) excess level is reached. With a small integrated luminosity, the BumpHunter algorithm is unable to identify the excesses due to the signals injected but, with sufficiently high integrated luminosity values, the BumpHunter starts to converge on the signal (see for example Figure 1(a) for luminosities above 25 fb\({}^{-1}\)) and in a few luminosity steps the associated p-value drops enough to claim a 5 \(\sigma\) discovery.

The results of the sensitivity scan are summarized in figure 3. The integrated luminosity values corresponding to 1, 25, 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are taken as references as these are the amount of data expected by the end of the first month of data taking, by the end of the first year, by the end of Phase-1 and by the end of Phase-2. It is worth to notice that the first fb\({}^{-1}\) of data collected gives a sensitivity sufficient to discover already a q* of mass up to \(\sim\)4 and a QBH up to \(\sim\)7.

## 8 Expected limits on New Physics benchmarks

For each New Physics (NP) process under study, Monte Carlo samples have been simulated at a number of selected mass points (\(m_{\rm NP}\)). Assuming no signal has been found in the search phase, the Bayesian method [5] is applied to the pseudo-data at these same mass points to set a 95% CL exclusion limit on

Figure 1: results of the search phase performed on the dijet mass spectrum containing a 6 with integrated luminosity of 200 fb\({}^{-1}\) (1a) and a 10 (b). The local excesses identified by the BumpHunter in these two examples correspond to deviations beyond 5 \(\sigma\).

the cross section times acceptance, \(\sigma\times\mathcal{A}\), for the NP signal as a function of \(m_{\text{NP}}\). A constant prior is used for the signal strength while Gaussian priors are used for the nuisance parameters representing the systematic uncertainties taken in consideration. The limit on \(\sigma\times\mathcal{A}\) from data is interpolated linearly between mass points to create a continuous curve. A NP signal is excluded at 95% CL below the mass (or energy scale) value where the \(\sigma\times\mathcal{A}\) limit from data coincides with the theoretical cross section.

The systematic uncertainties considered for this analysis are:

* **fitting procedure**: includes both the effects of limited statistics on the fitting procedure and the choice of fitting function (four or five parameter), as in Ref. [5].

Figure 3: sensitivity scan results for the q* (3a) and the QBH (3b). Red lines indicate 1, 25, 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity values.

Figure 2: luminosity scan on 6 TeV q* (2a) and 10 TeV QBH (2b) signals. The evolution of the local excess identified by the BumpHunter (associated p-value) as a function of the integrated luminosity is shown by the red (black) points. For each signal mass point, the scan is terminated when the associated p-value reaches a deviation corresponding to 5 \(\sigma\).

* **Jet Energy Scale (JES) uncertainty**: where the 8 TeV JES uncertainty [14] is used as a baseline. The JES uncertainty corresponding to jets of a given \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) at 8 TeV is applied to jets with \(1.75\cdot p_{\mathrm{T}}\) at 14 TeV2, to emulate the higher kinematic reach of the processes in the in-situ techniques used to estimate the uncertainty. The effects of the nuisance parameters of the JES uncertainty are propagated separately. This is the dominant uncertainty. Footnote 2: 14 TeV/8 TeV = 1.75.
* **luminosity estimation**: the estimation from 2012 (2.8%) [15] has been used.

These uncertainties are incorporated in the limit setting by varying all sources according to Gaussian probability distributions and convolving them with the posterior probability distribution. Credibility intervals are then calculated numerically from the resulting convolutions. No uncertainties are applied to the theoretical cross section, since the \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) acceptance uncertainty is already accounted for in the JES uncertainty and the jet angular uncertainty is negligible.

The results of the limit setting on \(\mathrm{q}^{*}\) and QBH are shown in Figure 4 and summarized in Table 1. By comparing these results with those obtained using the full 8 TeV statistics [5], it is possible to achieve similar sensitivity to the current \(\mathrm{q}^{*}\) limit with about 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) of luminosity at 14 TeV and significantly improve the limit on QBH. Approximately 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of luminosity is enough to extend the limits up to 5.0 TeV and 8.9 TeV for the \(\mathrm{q}^{*}\) and the QBH, respectively.

Figure 4: expected limits on \(\mathrm{q}^{*}\) (4a) and QBH (4b) models. The dashed vertical lines represent the current limits based on 20.3 fb\({}^{-1}\) of 8 TeV data: 4.09 TeV for the \(\mathrm{q}^{*}\) and 5.75 TeV for the QBH.

## 9 Conclusions

The sensitivity of the dijet resonance search has been investigated in view of the energy upgrade of the LHC. MC samples of \(pp\) collisions at the 14 LHC are used to estimate the reach of the analysis. Samples have been smeared, in order to reproduce the performances of the ATLAS detector, accordingly to the ECFA prescriptions. Excited quarks and Quantum Black Holes have been used as benchmark models.

Sensitivity scans have shown that approximately 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data is sufficient for the discovery at 5 \(\sigma\) of q\({}^{*}\) with mass up to \(\sim\)4 and QBH up to \(\sim\)7. Excited quarks up to masses of 7 will be within reach of discovery with a total integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), while the reach for Quantum Black Holes with the same amount of data extends to 10.

The limits set on q\({}^{*}\) have shown that the current limits (4.09 observed, 3.99 expected), obtained using 20.3 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at 8, can be matched already with 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) at 14 (expected limit at 4.0), while the limits on QBH can be set at 8.2 (from 5.75 for 8, observed and expected). With 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)of data at 14 the limits can be pushed up to 5.0 for excited quarks and up to 8.9 for Quantum Black Holes.

The studies reported in this note have shown that the energy step of the LHC will allow the dijet resonance search to rapidly equal the results obtained during Run-1 and will quickly put within reach the possibility to discover new physics manifesting at higher mass values.
