###### Abstract

Triggered by the requirement of lead absorbers of increasing thickness with radius, we have gained experience with the machining of lead sheets for the absorbers of the ATLAS accordion electromagnetic End-Cap calorimeter. Using several machining techniques, sheets of various sizes and thicknesses have been produced and measured at different companies. Thickness measurement results are presented here in a "chronological" order. The specifications for thickness requirements for ATLAS have been achieved, and manufacturing procedures, as well as full production quotes, have been obtained.

## 1 Introduction

The high precision lepton and photon physics to be carried out with the LHC detectors imposes very tight tolerances in their design and construction. In particular, the Lead-Liquid Argon Electromagnetic Calorimeter for ATLAS needs lead absorbers of uniform thickness to better than 1%. Two geometries for the lead absorbers have been considered in the design phase of the end cap part of the calorimeter. In one of them the thickness of the lead is constant (1.6 mm), whereas in the second the thickness varies linearly with radius (from 1.2 to 2.6 mm approximately).

A feasibility study for the production of such absorbers has been carried out at UAM, with the collaboration of the three following mechanical manufacturing companies:

1. Tecnicas Aeronautics Madrid (TAM). This is a small private workshop (\(\sim\) 20 technicians) located in the Madrid area.
2. Empresarios Agrupados (EA). It is an engineering group which actually subcontracted the machining to another company named CESA (large state-owned workshop specialized in aeronautics). Both EA and CESA are in the Madrid area.

3. Talleres Aratz (TA). This is a small privately owned workshop (\(\sim 20\) technicians) located in the Vitoria area.

A learning curve in the machining of the lead has been achieved. We have produced constant and varying thickness lead plates of several sizes similar to the two types ( 500 \(\times\) 500 mm\({}^{2}\) and 1000 \(\times\) 500 mm\({}^{2}\)) which make up the ATLAS accordion EM End-Cap calorimeter. We present the results as they were obtained during 1995 in a chronological order and sorted by partner companies.

## 2 Results from Tecnicas Aeronauticas Madrid

### Prototype 1

At TAM, three plates of 950 \(\times\) 420 mm\({}^{2}\) with a thickness varying from 1.7 to 2.3 mm were produced. The thickness changes along lines of constant \(x\) in a linear way. The plates were manufactured on a numerically controlled three-dimensional milling machine, equipped with a special cutting head for lead and operated at slow r.p.m.'s with no cooling liquid. The cutting head had a device for removing the debris from the cutting path. The plates were fixed to the machine bed by a vacuum suction support approximately the size of the plate and with a grid of holes spaced a few centimeters apart. The vacuum was contained by a rubber seal close to the edges of the plate. The support jig (made of aluminum) was machined flat in a previous operation, (supposedly) to a smoothness better than few \(\mu\)m.

The thickness measurements were performed with a D. E. A., an automatic 3-D position measurement machine with a (pressure) feeler gauge probe. Each plate was laid flat on the D. E. A. granite table and its height measured at different points following a rectangular grid. A very thin layer of silicon grease was used to help keep the lead plate as flat as possible on the granite.

As an overview, figure 1 shows a three-dimensional plot of the thickness measurements for the first plate made. One can already see by eye that this plate shows some deviations from linearity in the low \(y\) region. To have a more quantitative look at those deviations, figure 2 shows the thickness measurements at four different constant thickness lines of plate 1. See figure 1 for the approximate location of the lines. The R.M.S. corresponding to the measurements in those four lines are 5, 7, 28 and 41 \(\mu\)m. The thicknesses toward the edges in the \(y\) direction are systematically lower, as seen specially in the bottom plots of figure 2. This behavior, with similar R. M. S. values, is seen also for the other two plates which were machined.

Figure 3 shows measurements along lines of changing thickness (constant \(y\), see figure 1 for the approximate location of the lines). As we move from high to low \(y\) clear deviations (of \(\sim\pm 50\mu\)m) from linearity are observed. Again, this trend is also observed in the other two plates. TAM traced those problems down to an insufficiently dense grid of vacuum holes in the low \(y\), low \(x\) (see figure 1) corner of the vacuum jig. This vacuum jig was not designed and built for this prototype, but rather it was one of the tools from a previous project at the company and had a different hole density at different \(y\) values.

The quality of the measurement method was carefully checked for reproducibility. In addition, a totally different measurement method based on an ultrasonic probe was also Figure 1: _Thickness measurements of one plate. Coordinates are in mm._

used. In this case the probe was located on the plate by hand by a technician. As a gauge of the measurement accuracy, figure 4 shows the difference in thickness measurements for the same points obtained with the two methods. The difference shows a \(\sigma\) of 9 \(\mu\)m while its mean is displaced by 5 \(\mu\)m from zero. The displacement of the mean may indicate an imperfect calibration of the ultrasonic probe.

This was, as far as we know, the first time that thin lead plates covering a large area were machined to achieve thickness tolerances at the 10 \(\mu\)m level by a Spanish company. The results of this first prototype, although not yet within our specifications, showed us the feasibility of mass production of variable thickness lead plates with the very stringent tolerances imposed by the physics of the LHC.

### Prototype 2

Using a vertical lathe equipped with a special cutting head for lead, two sheets of radially varying thickness were manufactured. The plates were held in a special jig with a vacuum support structure, which was rigidly and precisely attached to the rotating disk of the lathe, the head moving only vertically and radially. Again, the vacuum support structure had been machined flat in a previous operation and the vacuum was contained by rubber sealing. The suction of the vacuum was not enough to overcome the centrifugal force on the plate due to the disk rotation. Therefore the lead plates were also clamped to the jig along their whole contour.

The plates were the size required for the inner ring of the EC modules covering a

radius from 614 mm to 1077 mm and with thickness increasing outwards from 1.0 to 1.8 mm. The plates, when flat, cover a sector of 60\({}^{\circ}\).

Measurements were performed this time with the ultrasonic probe on a grid of 6 arcs (of constant thickness) with 11 measurements (every 5\({}^{\circ}\)) on each. The probe was located by hand by the technician. The R.M.S. spreads of the measured thicknesses at constant radii vary from 7 to 14 \(\mu\)m on plate 1 and from 7 to 13 \(\mu\)m on plate 2. Figure 5 shows the thickness at the 6 different radii for plate 1. One can observe smaller thicknesses at the first and last measurements of some of the radii, probably due to the stiffness of the rubber below the sheet holding the vacuum. Figure 6 (top) shows the profile of the increasing thicknesses for several radii. At each radius, the mean value of the measured thicknesses was taken. A straight line fit over all the radii was performed for each plate. The deviations of the thickness measurements from these lines (as seen in figure 6 bottom) have an R.M.S. spread of 16 \(\mu\)m in the case of plate 1 and 32 \(\mu\)m for plate 2.

The difference in thickness between the two plates has a mean value of 60 \(\mu\)m with an R.M.S. spread of 26 \(\mu\)m. However, a change in the difference can be seen. While for the two first (most internal) radii the difference is \(\sim 100\)\(\mu\)m, the measurements for the other radii show a difference of \(\sim 40\)\(\mu\)m. If we take plate 1 as a (good) reference, we conclude some step occurred in the machining of plate 2. This conclusion was confirmed by TAM. There was a power outage during the machining of plate 2 and an offset appeared when resuming the work on it.

### Reproducibility study

To study the reproducibility of the production of radially variable thickness plates, 5 sheets were machined consecutively on the vertical lathe. Each one is of the type described in the previous section. This time, however the thickness was measured with the ultrasonic probe on a finer grid, with 11 points measured along each of 9 arcs of increasing radii.

For all plates, the thicknesses measured along lines of constant thickness have R.M.S. spreads of 6 to 17 \(\mu\)m with typical values of 12 \(\mu\)m. Figure 7 shows a detailed look at those measurements at different radii for plate 3. A systematic effect of increasing thickness with angle at first and then decreasing after the middle of the plate can be seen at most radii. While the rising and decreasing thickness can be seen for all 5 plates, the "peak" thickness is found at different angles for different plates. Furthermore, there seem to be two "sorts" of plates, one group ( formed by the so-called plates 3 and 7) with the "peak" thickness almost in the middle of the plates at 30\({}^{\circ}\), the other group (plates 4, 5 and 6) somewhat "earlier" (20\({}^{\circ}\)). The reason for this effect is not understood by TAM, but, if corrected, the R.M.S. values of the measurements at constant thickness lines could be reduced further to below 10 \(\mu\)m.

We have compared the thickness at the same points on different plates. Table 1 shows the mean values and \(\sigma\)'s ( \(<z^{i}-z^{j}>\) and \(\sigma(z^{i}-z^{j})\) ) of the distributions formed by the difference of measured thicknesses for the different combinations of pairs of plates (plate \(i\) vs. plate \(j\)). If the plates belong to the same "group" the \(\sigma\) spread of the thickness difference can be as small as 6 \(\mu\)m, while if from different groups it is more like 14 \(\mu\)m. The mean values of the latter distributions show a large spread.

Figure 7: _Thickness at several radii._As in figure 6, we can plot the thicknesses along a radius. Fits to straight lines (one line per plate) show rather similar slopes (equal within \(\sim 1\%\)) but the intercepts differ by up to \(\sim 8\%\) meaning that the mean thickness of the plates differs to that extent. These results are summarized in table 2. The different intercepts are consistent with the results in table 1 already discussed. TAM is confident that these offsets can be eliminated in mass production. The residuals of the measured thicknesses to the straight line fits have \(\sigma\) spreads of 15 to 18 \(\mu\)m (see table 2). These spreads could be reduced substantially if the systematic increase/decrease thickness pattern along the lines of constant thickness is eliminated.

## 3 Results from Empresarios Agrupados

At Empresarios Agrupados, two plates of each of the two sizes needed were manufactured for the variable thickness option. The sizes were 600 \(\times\) 800 mm\({}^{2}\) and 1200 \(\times\) 800 mm\({}^{2}\) with thickness varying linearly between 2.9 and 1.7 mm.

The thickness measurements were done in an automatic 3D D. E. A. machine following a rectangular grid. In order to help keeping the lead plate as flat as possible on the granite

table, a thick, heavy stainless steel plate was placed on top of the lead. The steel plate had holes at the points corresponding to the measurement grid. Each hole was big enough to allow the probe to reach the lead.

A contour plot with the measurements of one of the two large plates can be seen in figure 8. The deviation from the theoretical tilted plane was measured with an R.M.S. of 33 \(\mu\)m and a mean deviation of 12 \(\mu\)m.

Table 3 shows the mean and R.M.S. values of the deviations from nominal thicknesses for the two small and the two large plates manufactured by EA. The reason for the measured offset was not identified. The large R.M.S. in the small plate 1 was due (again) to a too stiff rubber vacuum seal. This was partially corrected for the plates machined afterwards.

## 4 Results from Talleres Aratz

In a first iteration Talleres Aratz produced a long plate with a rather small width (1270\(\times\)130 mm\({}^{2}\)) and a constant thickness, 2.8 mm. Excluding some measurements at one side of the plate where the machining started and where a problem was identified, the R.M.S. of the thickness measurements was 18 \(\mu\)m.

The machining method was similar to that for the first prototype at TAM and for all the plates at EA.

A lead plate with a more realistic size (1200 \(\times\) 600 mm\({}^{2}\)) was machined in the second iteration. The thickness measurements were performed in this case by using a manual 3D D.E.A. machine following a rectangular grid. The plates were kept flat on the granite table by means of iron blocks on top of the lead. The global R.M.S. of the thickness measurements was \(\sim\) 25 \(\mu\)m. Grouping the measurements along the machining direction, the R.M.S. obtained was below 10 \(\mu\)m, while a systematic increase (of several 10's of \(\mu\)m) in thickness was observed in the perpendicular direction. This problem was traced by TA to some temperature gradients in the milling machine.

In the third iteration however (also with a 1200 \(\times\) 600 mm\({}^{2}\) plate), the milling machine was running during the whole night before machining in order to minimize any possible temperature gradient at the time of machining and in this way, the problem was solved. A surface with the measurements of this third plate can be seen in figure 9. Figure 10 shows the Gaussian behavior of the thickness measurements of this plate. The fit gives \(\sigma=10\mu m\).

To investigate the possibility of reducing production costs, a fourth plate of the same dimensions was machined. The main difference in this last iteration was that the "raw material" was a (precision) laminated (to an accuracy of \(\pm\) 50 \(\mu\)m) plate provided by "Apparatebau Goslar" (a German metal supplier). The plate required less machining to achieve a result similar to the third plate, and TA was confident enough with the procedure to reduce its cost estimate for lead sheet production by 25%. Nevertheless, from this last iteration it became apparent that careful handling of the lead (e.g. by means of vacuum tools) is needed even at the "raw" stage.

## 5 Summary

During 1995 under the leadership of the HEP group of the Universidad Autonoma de Madrid, three companies have developed tools and methods for machining large area, small thickness (\(\sim\) 2 mm) lead plates with variable and constant thickness and with very tight thickness tolerances (1%). This study was part of the R & D phase of the design of the End-Cap part of the ATLAS electromagnetic Liquid Argon accordion calorimeter.

Several prototypes have been manufactured and their thicknesses carefully measured. R.M.S. spreads in thickness of less than 1% are now routinely achieved for both constant and variable thickness lead plates of sizes similar to the Liquid Argon End Cap Calorimeter absorbers.
