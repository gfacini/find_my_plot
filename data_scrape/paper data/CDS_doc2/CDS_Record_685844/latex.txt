## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS muon spectrometer is based on a 8-coil toroid magnet which generates an approximately toroidal magnetic field over a radial distance of the order of 5 m with an average field integral of 2.7 and 6 Tm in the barrel and endcaps respectively [1]. The muon detector consists of precision chambers made of pressurized drift tubes and trigger chambers for which the baseline is a combination of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) and Thin Gap Chambers(TGCs)) [2]. It is divided into the barrel region (\(|\eta|<1.2\)) and the endcap region (\(1.2\lesssim|\eta|\lesssim 2.8\)). In the barrel region the momentum determination rests on a sagitta measurement, in the endcap region on a point-angle measurement. In both cases three layers of chambers are used, called MI, MM, and MO for the inner, middle and outer stations respectively. The chamber layout which has a direct impact on the spectrometer resolution has been optimized with respect to geometrical acceptance, access to electronics, alignment facilities, field inhomogeneities and chamber construction [1].

This note describes the precision chambers based on the Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) concept which emerged from the three different approaches which were studied extensively over the past years. It combines the most attractive features of the HPDTs [3], HSCs [4], and JCCs [5] in a single technology. In addition, the developments for the muon detectors of SDC and GEM at the SSC have contributed substantially to our approach.

Each MDT chamber consists of six or eight layers of drift tubes, arranged such that three or four layers of closely-packed tubes (multilayers) are mounted to either side of a support structure. The two multilayers and the support structure form a chamber, see Fig. 1. The chambers are attached to the toroid magnet structure using three-point kinematic supports. Within the multilayers the wire support points are precisely positioned by construction andreferenced to multilayer fiducials.

Precise knowledge of the position of each wire is of central importance to the ATLAS muon system design. Within the system of three projectively aligned chambers forming a measurement tower we want to know the position of each wire to better than 0.050 mm (rms). This in turn requires that we know the placement (position) of anode wires relative to fiducials on the chamber to 0.020 mm rms. An internal monitoring system is used to track distortions in the chamber.

The critical elements of the muon chambers are the cylindrical drift tubes. They are specified to be 30 mm outer diameter aluminium tubes with 0.250 mm wall thickness. The choice of anode wire material and diameter has not been made; it will depend on resolution, reliability of operation (broad voltage plateau) and mechanical stability. Studies to determine the best choice of anode wire and other critical drift tube components will be carried out this year. The anode wire will be tensioned to approximately 60% of its elastic limit to minimize wire sag. Along its full length, the tube must be concentric with the wire within 0.100 mm (rms). The tubes range in length from approximately 1.2 m to 6 m. For the longest tubes it will probably be necessary to include a wire support at the midpoint. The design parameters and tolerance specifications for the drift tubes are listed in Table 1. The design goal for the single cell rms resolution averaged over the tube is 0.060 mm.

The very important area of signal processing and trigger processors is not addressed in this note. Although considerable experience exists in a number of groups, we must first

analyze the specific demands imposed by the MDT concept before launching electronics R&D. Ongoing efforts on trigger chambers and software are not part of this note.

## 2 Mechanical Construction of MDTs

### Production of Tubes

The basic drift cells of MDT chambers are round aluminium tubes with an outer diameter of 30 mm. The tubes are produced by chamber extrusion and are industrial standard. The material is a hard aluminium alloy of the Al Mn type (ALUMAN 100). By drawing the tubes over a mandril the wall thickness can be reduced to 250 \(\mu\)m. Tubes are made round and straight in a special machine by squeezing them to 80% of their diameter and by rotating and advancing them at the same time. Finally they are cut to the required length and the ends deburred. Degreasing of the surfaces in the factory is done by passing the tubes through a perchlor bath.

The tolerances for the final product are listed in Table 1. They will be controlled on a statistical basis during manufacturing. The weight of the tubes is 63 grams per metre.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline Outer diameter & \(30\pm 0.015\) mm \\ Wall thickness & \(0.250\pm 0.020\) mm \\ Eccentricity & \(<0.010\) mm \\ Straightness & \(<0.100\) mm/m \\ Anode wire diameter\({}^{a}\) & 0.050 mm \\ Wire material\({}^{b}\) & gold-plated W–Re \\ Tube concentric with anode wire & 0.100 mm (rms) \\ Anode wire tension & \(\sim\)60\% of elastic limit \\ Intermediate wire supports & smallest possible number \\ Gas mixture\({}^{c}\) & Ar-CO\({}_{2}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) (86:4:5:5) \\ Gas pressure\({}^{d}\) & 3–5 bar absolute \\ Maximum drift time & 500 ns \\ Single cell resolution (averaged over cell) & 0.060 mm (rms) \\ Tube length\({}^{e}\) & 1.2–6 m \\ \hline \end{tabular} \({}^{a}\)Final choice will depend on resolution studies

### Assembly of Individual Tubes

The goal is to fabricate individual tubes and test them for gas tightness and verify electrical properties before their assembly into multilayers. Given the large number of tubes, automatic assembly of the individual tubes with wire, wire supports and endplugs is foreseen.

The wire supports are injection moulded centering discs which can be produced with a precision of better than \(\pm\) 3 \(\mu\)m. The location of these supports is close to the tube ends and at the center of the longest tubes. In the presently preferred design the wire supports touch the inner wall of the tubes and have an opening for the wire which is at the same time accurately positioned and free to slide. The tube endplugs provide the electrical contact to the wire and hold the mechanical wire tension. They also contain the gas seals of each tube as well as a stub for the flexible gas tube that connects to the manifold. The endplugs may also carry small PC boards for the preamplifiers, the decoupling capacitors, and the terminating resistors. All of this is housed in a small Faraday cage which is grounded. The final design of the endplug is not yet fixed; one of the possible solutions is shown in Fig. 2.

Before equipping the tubes they need a further careful cleaning to remove residual impurities and to prepare the tube surface for glueing. A possible assembly sequence is as follows: First the wire is strung and pulled through the (relatively large) openings of the endplugs. Then the wire supports are placed around the wire, in their final position. After that the aluminium tube is pushed over this assembly and the endplugs are fixed to the tubes using for example the method of 'electromagnetic crimping'. The principle of this technique is to discharge a capacitor into a coil and thus induce eddy currents in the aluminium in such a way that it contracts the tube end. The wire is then stretched to \(\sim 60\%\) of its elastic limit and fixed to the contact pin.

Figure 2: Example of an endplug design with its attached front-end electronics

### Assembly of Multilayers

Tested drift tubes (DTs) are assembled into units consisting of three or four layers of closely-packed tubes. The number of DTs per unit is at this moment not defined, pending the results of prototyping. It may range from as few as eight per layer up to \(\sim 100\) per layer. Essential to the construction of these units is the use of precision jigging to establish and maintain, during assembly and while the adhesive cures, the position (0.020 mm rms) of the DTs. In this approach we assume that the extruded DTs will meet the tolerances on mean wall thickness, outer diameter, eccentricity and straightness as specified in Table 1. We also foresee to keep the DTs at the nominal operating pressure during the glueing process, taking advantage of the fact that pressurizing the tubes to 5 bar absolute results in reducing the ellipticity to 15% of its value at atmospheric pressure [6].

Figure 3 shows two somewhat different techniques for the assembly of multilayers in a precision jig. The first approach (a) emphasizes smaller, more easily handled units. Single-layer groups of 8 tubes are held in one jig and bonded together. Then pairs of single-layer tubes are held in the jig and bonded into two-layer groups. The jigging controls each tube to very high accuracy at those points where the wires are located, namely the endplugs and wire support. As a final step, pairs of two-layer groups are held in the jig and bonded into four-layer units. The other approach (b) puts more emphasis on the jigging for assembling of complete multilayers. Four layers of tubes forming a multilayer are held in jigging and bonded together. The key elements are: the master base plate which establishes horizontal placement of every tube in the bottom layer; the combs which establish the placement of every tube in the top layer; and the side walls which establish the relationship between the combs and the master base plate [7]. The middle two layers of tubes are positioned indirectly by the top and bottom layers, in contrast to the previous scheme in which each tube is held by jigging as the adhesive sets. Prototypes will be built this year in order to evaluate these procedures. Detailed measurements of the position of the drift tubes will be made in order to determine how well each meets the tolerance requirements for the ATLAS muon system. From this experience we will develop an assembly procedure to be followed by all MDT production sites.

### Assembly of Chambers

Figure 1 shows the two multilayers attached to top and bottom of a spacer structure. Boxes at the ends of each multilayer contain the wiring, front-end tube electronics and gas manifolding.

The multilayers will be mounted so that the curvature of the module follows that of the wire. There are two ways to achieve this: one is to design the support structure so that the curvature of the module is established by the force of gravity; the other is to build the curvature into the spacer structure to which the two multilayers are attached. Both of these concepts are being studied. We are considering both aluminum and carbon fiber composite spacers. The latter results in a considerably lighter structure which, however, is more expensive.

Figure 4 shows an example of an all aluminum structure made from a set of webs, each of which is a simple I-beam; the number of webs and holes shown is purely conceptual at this stage. Lines of sight for monitoring equipment are easily accommodated in this structure.

Figure 3: Examples of jigging methods

of the structure and other geometric considerations. For example, if a single wire support is used halfway along each drift tube, a cross web would be needed at this position.

### In-Plane Alignment

#### 2.5.1 Principle

The tube units of Fig. 1 are mounted on three 'comb plates' (two outer plates and one middle plate; the latter may not be needed for the smaller chambers). The comb plates accurately define the positions of the tube units in \(y\) and \(z\). They are equipped with RASNIK alignment systems [4]. These systems measure the position, in three coordinates, of the middle component (the lens) with respect to the centre point between the outer components (an illuminated coded mask and a CCD with video readout respectively). There are two systems along the chamber edges parallel to the tubes, and two diagonal systems, see Fig. 5. The edge and the diagonal systems share the same CCDs.

Shifts in the position of the middle comb plate with respect to the outer two is monitored by the two edge systems. The shift in \(z\) of the middle comb is measured twice, while the shift in \(y\) and the rotation over the \(x\) axis (the tube direction) follows from the \(y\) values of the edge systems. The torque of the chamber can be defined as the relative rotation around the \(x\) axis of the two outer comb plates. The diagonal systems can monitor this rotation by

Figure 4: Example for a support structure

taking the difference between the two \(y\) values. The average of the \(y\) and \(z\) values of the diagonal systems are also a measure for the \(y\) and \(z\) shift of the middle comb, thus providing for redundancy in the data. A shift in \(x\) of the middle comb plate causes a change in the \(z\) values of the diagonal systems. The correlation between the diagonal \(z\) coordinates and the \(x\) (\(3^{rd}\)) coordinate of all systems provides again for redundancy. The consistency of the data is a measure for the errors of the in-plane alignment.

The in-plane alignment data is to be combined with data from the projective and axial alignment of the muon towers. The components for these alignment systems are mounted on the edges of the outer comb plates. The position of the four corners of the middle chamber with respect of those of the other two chambers in the muon tower is therefore known, and thus, with the in-plane alignment data, the relative position between wires within the tower.

#### 2.5.2 Mechanical realisation

One concept for the outer comb plates is shown in Fig. 6. The plates have an I-beam shape; the top and bottom constricts allow a different thermal expansion of the top and bottom tube units. The middle comb plate has the shape of a box girder and fixes the relative position of the top and bottom multilayers.

Figure 6 also shows the design of the holes in the central part of the comb plates which are used for mounting the piece with a mask or a CCD. A similar design is used for the lens piece of the edge RASNIK systems. For the diagonal systems an additional wedge-shape spacer is needed for the lens pieces.

The offsets of the RASNIK pieces are measured in an alignment station as shown in Fig. 7. It consists of three position-adjustable supports for the pieces. The alignment of the three supports is measured by means of three calibration pieces: gauge blocks with either a mask, a lens or a CCD. After measuring the position of the image on the CCD, all three blocks are put upside down on their supports: the shift of the image on the CCD equals four

Figure 5: The in-plane and projective alignment systems of a muon tower

times the misalignment of the middle support with respect to the outer two [4].

Successive gauge block rotations and adjustments of the position of the supports results in an alignment error of a few microns, in both the coordinates perpendicular to the optical axis.

The alignment station is used for mounting the mask, lens or CCD on their pieces. For each individual piece the (offset) values for the three coordinates of the lens can be read out and stored in a database.

#### 2.5.3 Verification

For the assembly with the tube units, the comb plates are put in position in an assembly station. The RASNIK pieces are put in their position determined by the holes shown in Fig. 6. The consistency of the data from the four RASNIK systems is a measure for the precision of the systems, of the measurement of the offsets in the alignment station, and of the position of the reference holes in the comb plate.

### Acceptance Test for Chambers

We are evaluating a concept for the final acceptance procedures of completed chambers. The procedures cover both electrical and mechanical checks to certify compliance with the ATLAS muon chamber specifications.

The possibility to use X-ray radiography to measure the wire position in the finished detectors has been advocated for both the ATLAS muon chambers [8] and the ATLAS TRT [9]. The idea is simple: a collimated beam of X-rays is scanned across the detector; in one scheme, the absorption of the beam, produced by the detector is recorded. Wire positions can be derived from the additional absorption caused by the anode wire. Tests carried out at Dubna demonstrated that this method provides adequate sensitivity. Calculations indicate that the same method can be used to X-ray a finished MDT module and to obtain in one scan the wire positions of all 6 (8) layers.

An interesting variant of the simple absorption approach has been suggested by the RD 6 collaboration: X-rays will eject photoelectrons from the surface of the anode wire. If the tubes are scanned in an operational mode (appropriate gas filling, HV, electronic readout activated) the count rate registered at the anode as a function of the X-ray beam position would then provide an accurate measurement of the wire position. This method has the attractive advantage to provide a simultaneous mechanical and electrical acceptance test of the chambers prior to installation.

The ATLAS muon group plans to develop these techniques rapidly as a tool to assure the mechanical integrity of the various prototypes which will have to be constructed in the coming 18 months. After this initial round of experience it will be decided if one of these methods will be finally used for overall acceptance tests of the muon chambers.

### Chamber Support on the Magnet

Given that the design of the toroid is not yet finalized and that the chamber design is still at a very conceptual stage, only a preliminary discussion of mounting schemes is possible.

It is assumed that, wherever possible, the individual muon chambers will be installed on the barrel toroid by rolling them in from the ends on a set of rails. As even the largest chamber is quite light (less than 1500 kg, including its trigger chambers) only small bearings and rails are needed. However, as the rails have to span the gaps between the struts of the toroid it will be necessary to mount the rails on a longitudinal support which is stiff enough to keep the deflections within acceptable limits. As this system will become part of the toroid structure, it must be designed in close collaboration with the barrel toroid design team.

#### 2.7.1 Barrel chamber mounting

Figure 8 shows a conceptual study for the mounting of the barrel chambers. Depending on the position and size of the chambers the mounting scheme will vary.

Large chambers:The large MI chambers can be mounted on rails attached to the reinforcement plates on the cryostat. These plates are used to transfer the circumferential forces from the struts through the individual coil tanks.

The large MM chambers can also be mounted on rails attached to the reinforcement plates. Alternatively, special attachment points could be provided on the vacuum tank for this purpose.

The mounting of the large MO chambers presents the greatest difficulty. In the present chamber layout the large chambers are mounted at larger radius than the small MO chambers, and with an overlap. The outer struts in the toroid structure provide anchoring points for the rail system. However, the rails must be mounted on brackets which snake through the gap between the large and small chambers. The RPCs may have to be located on the outside of the MO chamber to provide clearance for these brackets.

Small chambers:The small MI chambers are stiff structures. Several possibilities to support these chambers exist, for example they can be mounted on the inner edge of the cryostat reinforcing plates. The small MM chambers interlock through the holes in the coil cryostat and must be mounted directly in place. Probably, brackets welded to the cryostat will be used. The small MO chambers are large enough to require that the module shape matches the wire sag. They are best mounted on a rail system using the same brackets as the large MO chambers.

Figure 8: Conceptual study for the mounting of the barrel chambers

Trigger chambers:FEA analysis of the chambers shows that mounting the RPCs directly on the chambers requires a very heavy internal chamber structure. It is much more efficient to use a lightweight and relatively flexible frame to hold the RPCs and to mount this frame to the chamber at the same points used to mount the chamber to the toroid. This ensures that no forces from the RPCs are applied to the chamber. The whole chamber, complete with RPCs can then be installed as a unit.

#### 2.7.2 Endcap chambers

The endcap muon system is at present less well defined than the barrel. Three different mounting schemes will be used: chambers mounted on the barrel toroid, chambers mounted on the endcap toroids, and chambers mounted on the cavern wall.

In the endcaps all chambers are vertically oriented so matching to the wire sag is a function of the chamber construction, not its mounting. The chambers mounted on the wall and on the barrel toroid will be put in place individually using adjustable brackets. The chambers mounted on the endcap will probably be assembled as complete rings and then lowered into the cavern. Given the limited longitudinal space available for these chambers, the support structure between the two half-layers of tubes will have to be extended to act as a complete'spider' such that a complete ring assembly can be constructed. No design concepts for this have been generated yet.

## 3 System Performance of MDTs

### Properties of Single Drift Cells

Several constraints determine the performance of single tubes: due to the cylindrical cell geometry the electrical field varies with \(1/r\) leading to non linear time-space relations. To limit chamber ageing and occupancy the drift tubes will be operated in the proportional mode. The maximum drift time should not exceed 500 ns in order to keep the occupancy due to the expected photon and neutron background sufficiently low. Gas diffusion has to be small enough to allow for a single wire resolution of 60 \(\mu\)m at pressures in the range of 3-5 bar. The variation of the drift velocity per degree of temperature change should be less than 0.1%. The pressure dependence of the drift velocity should not exceed 0.1% per 1 mmHg. Another aim is to keep the Lorentz angle below 10\({}^{\circ}\) for a typical magnetic field of 0.6 T. Finally, the gas mixture must be non-flammable for safety reasons.

The properties of various gas mixtures were studied either through computer simulation (MAGBOLTZ [10], GARFIELD [11]) or by measurements in a test beam. A good candidate for a suitable gas was found with a mixture of Ar, CO\({}_{2}\), N\({}_{2}\) and C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\). The time-space relation is given in Fig. 9 for different gas mixtures. Ar(90%) C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\)(5%) N\({}_{2}\)(5%) has a linear time-space relation because the drift velocity is in saturation in about 90% of the drift space. The mixture ist fast enough due to the content of C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) while the addition of N\({}_{2}\) has a smoothing effect on the drift velocity. Since this gas mixture has a rather high Lorentz angle (30\({}^{\circ}\)) a small component of CO\({}_{2}\) was added. In Fig. 10 the Lorentz angles are plotted as a function of \(E/p\) for different gas mixtures and pressures. A 4% addition of CO\({}_{2}\) at 3 bar is sufficient to limit the Lorentz angle to about 10\({}^{\circ}\) for the entire range of operation. As a small disadvantage, however, a reduced linearity of the drift time-space relation has to be taken into account.

Figure 11 shows an example of the single tube resolution as measured with the above discussed gas mixture. Studies and test experiments will continue for further optimisation of the gas mixture.

### Chamber Properties

Table 2 gives the contributions to the final measurement error in the bending plane with the present understanding of the chamber tolerances. The choice of a mattress structure in two separate layers (with an average distance between the two layers of the order 40 cm) has been guided by considering pattern recognition performance, autocalibration and angular resolution of single chambers. The possible use of four drift cell layers instead of three, although it improves slightly the spatial and angular resolutions of chambers, would be mainly driven by the improved robustness of the autocalibration procedure of individual chambers and of the pattern recognition in the spectrometer. The very good angular resolution allows an acceptable momentum measurement in the regions of limited acceptance (which represent \(\sim 8\%\) of \(4\pi\)) where only two chambers are available. It also improves significantly the measurement of muons crossing a strut between the magnet coils and in the region close to the coil where the sagitta determination is degraded by multiple scattering in matter located between the inner and middle chambers.

Figure 9: Drift time–space relation for different candidate gas mixtures

### Calibration

To fully exploit the single wire resolution of the MDTs the relation between the drift distance \(r\) and the drift time \(t\) has to be known with a precision of about 0.1%. Therefore it is necessary to follow all changes of the \(r-t\) relation due to variations of parameters like temperature, pressure, gas composition and contamination and the non-uniform magnetic field in the toroid. MAGBOLTZ and GARFIELD simulations show that the expected variation of the maximum drift time in the barrel system due to the inhomogeneous magnetic field is approximately 40%.

The following methods will contribute to the determination of the \(r-t\) relation for the ATLAS Muon Chambers:

* The use of simulation programs like MAGBOLTZ and GARFIELD. The present absolute precision of these simulations is limited by the accuracy of the calculation of the drift velocity and is a factor 10 worse than the required one. Accurate measurements of the drift velocity (to better than 0.3%) and the Lorentz angle over the whole parameter space are necessary.
* Test beam measurements where all operating parameters are varied and the corresponding \(r-t\) relations are stored in look-up tables. This procedure was adopted for the L3 muon detector for a less complicated magnetic field and a saturated drift gas. For this method the gas parameters and the magnetic field have to be known at each point of the muon chambers. This requires a system of temperature, pressure and magnetic field sensors as well as the use of monitor chambers to monitor the gas composition.
* Autocalibration, an in-situ calibration method which uses muon tracks in the spectrometer during normal operation. The \(r-t\) relation is determined in an iterative

Figure 10: Lorentz angle as function of E/p for different pressure valuesprocess, where a fit to the reconstructed hits is used to improve the \(r-t\) relation. This method has the advantage that a precise knowledge of gas parameters and magnetic field is not needed. For a successful use of this method one has to apply the autocalibration mechanism to data taken in a region where the bias introduced by variations of the parameters is sufficiently small.

One can also consider a combination of these methods. Simulations and test beam measurements together with autocalibration will most likely be used in areas where 'conventional' autocalibration is impossible due to strong changes of the parameters. An example for this may be the endcap muon chambers because of the strongly varying magnetic field in this region.

The feasability of different calibration techniques is currently under study using test beam data [4, 12] as well as simulations.

### Momentum Resolution

The calculation of the resolution has been worked out using the 3-dimensional field map of the toroids. The chambers are simulated by two tracking planes of equal resolution, \(\sigma=40\ \mu m\). The distance between the two planes is adjusted to match the angular resolution obtained with the full set of \(2\times 3\) drift cell layers. The alignment error, \(\sigma=30\ \mu m\) is applied coherently to each double plane system. A detailed description of the matter distribution seen by tracks has been introduced in the calculation. In the barrel region, the main contributions

Figure 11: Single tube resolution as measured with one of the candidate gas mixtures

come from the middle chamber (0.20 \(X_{0}\) at pseudo-rapidity \(\eta=0\) taking into account the thickness (0.10 \(X_{0}\)) of the trigger chambers) and the coil struts (3 \(X_{0}\) at maximum) which cover \(\sim\) 40% of the solid angle between two neighbouring coils. In the endcaps, the main contribution comes from the endplate of the toroid cryostat (0.8 \(X_{0}\)) located next to the middle chamber. Another contribution to the momentum resolution originates from the energy loss fluctuation in the calorimeter and the return yoke of the central solenoid. This contribution can be parametrized by a linear function of the muon momentum, varying from 0.31 GeV for \(p_{\mu}\)=10 GeV to 0.77 GeV for \(p_{\mu}\)=100 GeV, assuming that electromagnetic showers above 5 GeV coming from catastrophic energy loss can be detected in the hadron calorimeter.

As the field integral varies with azimuth from 2.3 Tm to 3.4 Tm (in the barrel), when moving from the medium plane between two coils to the coil plane, the momentum resolution is azimuth dependent. Figure 12 shows the resolution as a function of pseudo-rapidity at an average azimuth angle of 11.25 degrees with respect to the coil axis. It is dominated by energy loss fluctuations below \(p_{t}\)=25 GeV, and by the multiple scattering contribution in the range \(p_{t}\)=25-200 GeV. In the region covered by the magnet struts, the angle-angle measurement (using the MM and MO chambers), combined with the standard sagitta measurement, improves the total resolution by \(\sim\) 1% absolute for \(p_{t}\)=50 GeV.

## 4 Programme of Work

In this section we summarize instrumentation activities which have been started in a number of ATLAS institutes.

Work on the MDT concept proceeds on a number of components. Glueing tests of modules using precision jigging are under preparation at several institutes. Similarly the design effort continues on a few options of the spacer structure which will support the two multilayers and which together will form a chamber. Work on the other components

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline Drift cell layers/chamber & \(3+3\) & \(4+4\) \\ Average number of hits per chamber & 7 & 9 \\ \hline RMS positioning of wire w.r.t. chamber fiducials & 20 \(\mu\)m & 20 \(\mu\)m \\ RMS multilayer precision & 39 \(\mu\)m & 35 \(\mu\)m \\ RMS chamber precision & 28 \(\mu\)m & 25 \(\mu\)m \\ Thermal expansion (\(\Delta T=3K\)) & 5 \(\mu\)m & 5 \(\mu\)m \\ Total RMS precision of chamber & 30 \(\mu\)m & 27 \(\mu\)m \\ RMS error of sagitta measurement & 37 \(\mu\)m & 33 \(\mu\)m \\ RMS sagitta error incl. alignment error (30 \(\mu\)m) & 47 \(\mu\)m & 45 \(\mu\)m \\ Chamber thickness with carbon fiber support & 0.09 \(X_{0}\) & 0.10 \(X_{0}\) \\ Angular resolution for \(p_{t}~{}=~{}50~{}GeV\) (MM layer) & 0.13 mrad & 0.12 mrad \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Properties of the MDT chambers for the case of three and four layers of tubes per multilayer(endplugs, wire centering pieces) is also proceeding. A prototype of an automatic tube assembly stand is under construction at CERN. With this preliminary work we aim to arrive at a mechanical design for the MDT chambers in the fall of 1994. Several laboratories (Frascati, MPI Munich, NIKHEF, Seattle) have indicated that they are prepared to construct such a prototype, once the design features are defined.

Work on the preparation for test beam activities has also started. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the operational characteristics of the drift tubes, including their behaviour in a magnetic field. For this purpose we are planning to use rather small modules and to use as an external reference a high-resolution Si-strip telescope. As one of our major aims we wish to demonstrate calibration features, including autocalibration. These test beam measurements will be complemented by laboratory studies on gas mixtures, wire diameters and electronics.

Hardware oriented activities on tower and in-plane alignment will be continued. The muon alignment group is elaborating a proposal for the 'Demonstration of the ATLAS Chamber Alignment' (DATCHA). In this test stand we wish to develop the instrumentation and procedures in order to verify the quality of the proposed alignments schemes by construct

Figure 12: Transverse momentum resolution of the muon spectrometer, as a function of pseudorapidity \(\eta\). The discontinuities are caused by the structural elements (struts) of the barrel toroid magnet.

ing full scale models of the muon towers. The DATCHA proposal will be submitted to the collaboration in fall; we expect to start work on the alignment stand before the end of 1994.

We are actively evaluating procedures for MDT chamber acceptance tests. We have started to work on an 'X-ray tomograph' with the aim to measure the wire position of completed MDT chambers to an accuracy of \(\sigma\leq 20\)\(\mu\)m. Other methods, such as photogrammetry, are also being actively pursued. We expect to have first results on the feasability of such methods by the time of the technical proposal.
