###### Abstract

During September 1993, the University of Alberta provided a readout system for the RD3 calorimeter based on switched capacitor array chips. The readout system was tested by recording events from electron beams of various energies and calibration data. This note describes our analysis. A similar analysis has been performed by E. Auge _et al._[1].

## 1 Introduction

The RD3 calorimeter uses the liquid argon sampling technique with accordion geometry. This calorimeter is a prototype of the ATLAS electro-magnetic barrel calorimeter and is being tested in the H8 beam-line at the SPS. The prototype module is a section of a 2 m long cylinder which is divided radially into three depths: front, middle and back. Each depth covers \(27^{o}\) in the azimuthal (\(\phi\)) and has a pseudo-rapidity interval of \(0\leq\eta\leq 1.08\). The front and middle depths have a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.018\times 0.020\), while the back is twice as coarse in \(\eta\). Further details of the calorimeter have been described elsewhere [2].

Fast readout of the calorimeter is essential for minimizing the pile-up noise from the LHC. Charge preamplifiers based on silicon JFETs were used in the tests described here. These preamplifiers are mounted directly on the front and back faces of the calorimeter and operate at liquid argon temperature. The outputs from the preamplifiers are shaped with bipolar filters working at room temperature. The peaking time of the shaper response to a short current pulse is 18 ns, while a triangular ionization signal from the calorimeter peaks in about 35 ns. The average incoherent noise of this amplifier combination was measured to be about 50 MeV [3].

Readout System

The data were stored in analog pipelines until a readout trigger occurred. The signals from the shapers were sampled at 40 MHz and stored in analog memories. The memories used the switched capacitor array (SCA) technique and provided 256 storage cells (capacitors) per channel. When a readout trigger was received by the pipeline controller, the writing was stopped until the data from 10 time samples in each channel were read out. This method of operation had a large dead-time but simplified the controller functions to enable a detailed study of the SCA to be made.

The tests were performed by instrumenting 120 channels of the calorimeter with SCA readout. The readout system consisted of five readout modules and a controller board. Each readout module contained two SCA chips with 16 channels each. The tests described here used 12 of the 16 channels to simplify the connections to the shaper electronics. The data was digitized by 12-bit ADCs before being written to tape. The SCA readout system has been previously described in more detail [4, 5].

The readout system covered the calorimeter region \(0\leq\eta\leq 0.216\) and \(13.5^{o}\leq\phi\leq 18^{o}\). Two of the readout modules were allocated to the front, two to the middle, and one to the back calorimeter depths. The electronic channel assignment to calorimeter cells is shown in appendix A.

## 3 Data Analysis

Data from 29 runs were recorded and are summarized in appendix B. The data structure of the pipeline data block is described in appendix C.

The data is prepared for analysis as follows. Events are read from the input data file until an end-of-file or zero length event is found. If the event is a pre-burst or post-burst event, it is skipped. This occurs for about 13% of the events in the electron data. The first two events in a burst are skipped since many ADC values are either zero or saturated in these events. This occurs for about 0.9% of the events in the pedestal and pulser data. For each event read the data structure is checked. The pipeline data block is missing in about 9% of the events. If the pipeline data block is found the event is unpacked. Checks on the data are performed during unpacking and the event skipped if an error is detected. The addresses of the read out capacitors in the data should increase sequentially over the time samples. About 2% of the events have jumps in the capacitor addresses and are skipped. A bit pattern in the data word sequentially numbers the data. About 0.01% of the events have jumps in the data word sequences and are skipped. No events fail the other unpacking checks. After event reading and unpacking, approximately 84% of the events are available for analysis.

### Analysis of Pedestal Data

In total 14 pedestal runs were recorded. Three of the runs contain 3000 events and the remaining runs contain 1000 events each. We use one of the 3000 event runs (run 12650) as a typical run for our plots but have performed the analysis on all the runs.

None of the pedestal runs contain enough events to be able to determine a pedestal for each time sample for all capacitors. Figures 1 and 2 show histograms of the capacitor addresses and the number of ADC counts read out, respectively. The number of ADC counts range from about 30 to 200 counts. Since the distribution of addresses is not uniform we lack statistics for some capacitors. Hence we calculated pedestals for each capacitor by averaging over the time samples and pedestals for each time sample by averaging over the capacitors in each channel.

An error in the reset on the SCA chip caused the mean ADC counts for a given capacitor to be significantly different depending on the times sample read out. This is shown by the data points in figure 3a.

About 14% of the events have ADC counts about 40 counts above pedestal in all channels for a single time sample. This occurs most often for the first sample and frequently for the higher numbered samples. This is shown by the rms error on the data points in figure 3a. These events have been excluded from the analysis using the method described later.

The first time sample is very different from the others and the last sample significantly different. We thus ignored the first and last time samples in the analysis and only considered the remaining eight. This does not present a difficultly for the analysis since the pulses tended to have a maximum in either the fourth or fifth time sample. In the eight time samples there is on average a rise in ADC counts for a given capacitor with sample number. We used the pedestals for each time sample averaged over capacitors in each channel to estimate corrections that would make the pedestal of a capacitor independent of the time sample. Figure 3b shows the mean ADC counts versus sample after the first and last samples have been removed and the events with abnormally high ADC counts in a single sample have been removed. The rms errors are now approximately uniform over the samples. Figure 4 shows the sample corrections for each channel as a function of sample number. The spread in the data for each sample number represents the range of corrections which are applied to the channels.

The steps performed in the analysis of the pedestal data are as follows. Pedestals for each time sample in each channel are calculated by averaging over the capacitors in the channel. These pedestals are used to estimate sample corrections. The sample corrections are then used to calculate a pedestal for each capacitor by averaging over the time samples. Next the pedestals and sample corrections are recalculated by excluding events with the total number of sample-corrected and pedestal-subtracted ADC counts too large (2000 counts). Finally, another iteration of the last step is performed. Figure 5 show the total sample-corrected and pedestal-subtracted number of ADC counts in each event. A clear separation of the events with abnormally high ADC counts is seen.

A number of statistics are calculated for each run. For each capacitor with greater than one data value the mean ADC counts (pedestal) and rms deviation are calculated. The mean ADC counts for each capacitor averaged over the channels and mean ADC counts for each channel averaged over the capacitors, as well as, the global mean ADC counts averaged over all capacitors in all channels are calculated. The average rms deviation over the capacitorsFigure 2: Histogram of the number of ADC counts for each capacitor in run 12650.

in each channel and over the channels for each capacitor, as well as, the average of all rms deviations are also calculated. Figure 6 shows the number of mean and rms ADC counts versus channel number and versus capacitor number.

We observed that channels 72 and 73 were dead and have excluded them from all the analysis. The calorimeter cells corresponding to these channels are in the corner of the middle depth and should not affect the electron reconstruction. Likewise, capacitor 170 in channels 48 to 59 have been excluded since they are about 70 ADC counts above normal. These are all the channels in the first SCA chip on the third board and are connected to a quarter of the middle calorimeter depth. The even and odd channels have pedestal values differing by about 50 to 100 ADC counts. This is because the capacitors in the SCA chip were connected to different reference voltage lines for the even and odd channels. This peculiarity will be removed in the next version of the SCA chip. The pedestals cluster in groups of 12 corresponding to the different SCA chips. Channels 38 and 39 are noisy for each run. The last channel on each board is noisy and the first chip on the last board is particularly noisy.

The pedestals within a channel show a clear increase with capacitor number. This increase is too large, when compared to the noise, to have one pedestal per channel. We hope to reduce this slope in the future by performing a proper reset of the readout bus but do not anticipate a performance requiring only a single pedestal per channel.

The global mean ADC counts and average rms deviation for each pedestal run are shown in the table in appendix B. The global mean ADC counts and average rms deviation

Figure 6: Mean and rms ADC counts versus channel and versus capacitor in run 12650.

are about 93 and 1.3 counts respectively.

The pedestal subtracted ADC counts for the capacitors were histogramed and fit to a gaussian curve. Figure 7 show the presence of small non-gaussian tails. We use the one standard deviation width of the gaussian fit as an estimate of the noise per capacitor in the system (appendix B). We obtain an average noise per capacitor of 1.3 ADC counts. The noise includes contributions from the preamplifiers and shaping amplifiers. This contribution is estimated to be about 0.6 ADC counts, incoherent over the channels. The average noise in the pipeline system is thus about 1.2 ADC counts (100 MeV). A fraction of the noise from the pipeline system is coherent over the channels. We are in the process of performing a more detailed noise study.

Subtracting the average pedestal from the total ADC range gives a usable range of about 4000 counts. The ratio of the usable range to the noise is thus 4000/1.2 = 3333 counts, or greater than 11.7 bit.

Four of the 14 pedestal runs contained enough data to calculate a pedestal for each capacitor: runs 12650, 12887, 13005 and 13009. The pedestals and sample corrections from these valid runs will be used in the subsequent pulser and electron beam data analysis.

### Analysis of Pulser Data

In total eight pulser runs were recorded. The runs were taken with a variety of DAC settings and number of pulses per channel at each setting (see appendix B). The DAC settings ranged

Figure 7: Pedestal-subtracted number of ADC counts for the capacitors in run 12650.

from 0 to 24000 counts and covered about 60% of the ADC range. Normally the channels were pulsed in groups of 20 for 20 events at each DAC setting. Each time the pulser setting changed we skipped the event because of problems with the pulser. In the analysis of the pulser data, sample corrections and pedestals were calculated from the valid pedestal run which was recorded closest in time to the pulser run.

There is not enough pulser data in any of the runs to calibrate each capacitor individually. The best that can be done is to determine calibration constants for each channel. Run 12622 contains 100 pulses per channel at 30 different DAC setting. This would be an ideal run from which to determine the calibration data but the timing and gains are slightly different for this run when compared to the others. The log book shows that the trigger delay was changed between this run and subsequent pulser runs. We have not used run 12622 in the following analysis.

Run 12788 contains 500 pulses per channel at only two different DAC settings. In this case all channels were pulsed each event. While this run is not useful for determining channel gains, non-linearities or cross-talk, it could be used to study the capacitor-to-capacitor gain differences within a channel. This work is in progress so run 12788 is not included in the subsequent analysis.

A description of the analysis of the pulser data follows. Run 13010 (3000 events) was used as the typical run for the plots but we have performed the analysis on all the pulser runs; except for the two runs mentioned above.

We used the number of ADC counts from three adjacent time samples to estimate the pulse height. For each event and each pulsed channel, we determined the time sample, \(S_{max}\), with the maximum number of ADC counts, \(ADC_{max}\), after sample correction and pedestal subtraction. The ADC counts in the time samples before and after \(S_{max}\), along with \(ADC_{max}\), were fit to a parabolic pulse shape and the time, \(t_{max}\), of the maximum of the parabola calculated. Figure 8 is a scatter plot of \(S_{max}\) versus \(t_{max}\). The time of \(S_{max}\) was taken to be zero. We see that the pulses peak most often in the fourth and fifth time samples (95% of all pulses). The peaks occur in two time samples because the trigger and pipeline controller clocks were not synchronized, and hence could differ by up to one clock cycle.

We have estimated the channel-to-channel time differences. For each DAC setting we calculated the time difference between \(t_{max}\) of each pulsed channel and \(t_{max}\) of a reference channel. The reference channels in each of the six groups were chosen as 8, 9, 12, 13, 100 and 102; these being the most likely in each group to have the highest pulse height in the electron data. Figure 9 shows the time difference distribution for pulsed channels in all events. A simple fit to a gaussian resolution function gives an average channel-to-channel systematic time difference of about 1 ns. This number does not include time differences between the channels in different depths of the calorimeter.

For each pulse we formed the ratio of \(ADC_{max}\) to DAC counts. \(ADC_{max}/DAC\) is shown as a function of channel number in figure 10. We notice that channels 72 and 73 are dead, as in the pedestal runs. Also, for most of the pulser runs channel 24 was dead. All pulser runs also showed channels 84, 92, 98 and 99 having gains and non-linearities substantially different from the others. These bad channels have been excluded in any calculation involvingFigure 8: Sample number with the maximum ADC counts in each pulsed channel versus the time (ns) of the maximum of a parabola fit to the three ADC values centred on the maximum ADC value for run 13010.

an average over channels.

In a first pass through the pulser data we calculated a pulse height correction. For each pulse we plotted \(ADC_{max}/DAC\) versus \(t_{max}\) (figure 11a) and fit the data to a fourth order polynomial. We then made another pass through the data and divided \(ADC_{max}\) by the polynomial correction to estimate the pulse height, \(E_{max}\) (figure 11b). The correction makes the estimate of pulse height independent of \(t_{max}\) for most channels. The bad channels previously mentioned are clearly visible. Pulse height corrections could be calculated for each channel separately. This has not been done since it does not improve the performance and all the bad channels lie outside the nonet of calorimeter cells that we will consider in the electron analysis.

We calculated the mean and rms deviation of the pulse heights for each channel and each DAC setting. The rms deviations averaged over channels and the rms deviations averaged over DAC settings are shown in figure 12. The rms deviations do no vary much over the channels, except for the bad channels, and the variation is dominated by the last DAC setting. The rms deviation clearly increases with increasing DAC value. We attribute this to coherent noise fluctuations over the channels from the pulser at high DAC settings.

The channel gains and non-linearities were calculated as follows. We performed a least squares fit to the average pulse heights, \(E\), and DAC values for each channel using

\[DAC=g_{0}E+g_{1}E^{2} \tag{1}\]

to determine the channel gain, \(g_{0}\), and non-linearity, \(g_{1}\). Because of the non-linearity of the pulser at small DAC counts, we excluded the first DAC setting from the fits.

Since some of the events give abnormal pulse heights in several channels (as in the pedestal data) we have rejected these events in our calculations. The events were rejected by making a first pass through the data to calculate the gains and non-linearities using all events. We then use these gains and non-linearities in a second pass through the data to reject the events with the total energy (summed over all pulsed channels) too far from expectation and re-calculate the gains and non-linearities with the remaining events. Figure 13 shows \(E_{max}/DAC\) versus total fractional energy difference in the event. The total fractional energy difference,

\[\delta=1-\frac{g_{0}E+g_{1}E^{2}}{DAC}, \tag{2}\]

is summed over all pulsed channels in the event. Selecting events with \(|\delta|<1\) eliminates most of the bad events.

Figure 14 shows the resulting gain and non-linearity for each channel. The mean gain averaged over all the good channels is 11.0 DAC/ADC counts. The gains vary from 10.2 to 12.4 DAC/ADC counts except for the previously mentioned bad channels. The non-linearity (negative) is small and has a magnitude less than \(3\times 10^{-4}\) DAC/ADC\({}^{2}\) counts for

all channels. The percentage residuals of the fits are shown in figure 15. The fits are good except for the few bad channels previously mentioned and the lowest DAC setting.

The function in equation 1 contains no constant term since the pedestal has already been subtracted. If the pedestal is included as a free parameter in the fit, the gain and non-linearity for each channel change by less than 0.003% and 0.05% respectively.

We have attempted to determine the accuracy of the gains. Since the non-linearity is small, we have neglected it and calculated the average and rms deviation of the ratio \(DAC/E\) (gain) using all pulsed channels and DAC settings. We obtain \((10.8\pm 0.2)\) DAC/ADC counts.

We are in the process of using the pulser data to calculate the cross-talk in the system.

### Analysis of Electron Beam Data

In total seven electron runs were recorded. The runs were performed with three different beam energies and at four different impact point on the calorimeter (see appendix B). There is one run at 100 GeV, four at 180 GeV and two at 200 GeV. The impact points are all on cell 14 in \(\phi\) and cells 5, 8, 9 or 13 in \(\eta\).

In the analysis of the electron data, sample corrections, pedestals and gains were taken from the valid pedestal and pulser runs which were recorded closest in time to the electron runs. Run 12890 was used as the typical run for the plots but we have performed the analysis on all the electron runs. A description of the analysis of the electron data follows.

Figure 14: Gain and non-linearity versus channel number for run 13010.

We corrected the data by applying the sample corrections, subtracting the pedestals and applying the calibration coefficients to the ADC counts for each time sample and channel.

To determine the region of the calorimeter containing the electron shower we determined the impact cell in the front calorimeter depth. The impact cell was chosen to correspond to the channel with the highest ADC counts in either time sample four or five. As for the pulser data, the time sample with the maximum ADC counts is most often sample four or five.

A seed tower was formed by summing the ADC counts sample by sample in the impact cell and the cells behind it in the middle and back calorimeter depths (three cells in total). We called the time sample with the maximum summed ADC counts \(S_{max}\). If \(S_{max}\) was not sample four or five we rejected the event. We fit a parabola to the summed ADC counts in \(S_{max}\) and the summed ADC counts in the time samples before and after \(S_{max}\) to determine the time of the maximum of the parabola, \(t_{max}\).

We estimated a correction that would make the energy in a nonet of calorimeter towers (\(9+9+6=24\) calorimeter cells), centred on the seed tower, to be independent of \(t_{max}\). The nonet will contain approximately 94% of the electron energy [3]. For each event, we determined \(S_{max}\) and \(t_{max}\), and also summed the ADC counts, \(ADC_{nonet}\), for time sample \(S_{max}\) in the nonet. Figure 16 shows \(E_{nonet}\) versus \(t_{max}\). We fit this data to a sixth-order polynomial and then divided the ADC counts for time sample \(S_{max}\) in each channel by the polynomial correction. Figure 17 show \(ADC_{nonet}\) versus \(t_{max}\) after the pulse height correction. The correction is rather good and no cut on \(t_{max}\) is needed.

Figure 15: Percentage residuals versus a) channels and b) DAC counts for run 13010.

Figure 16: ADC counts in nonet versus time of maximum ADC counts in the seed tower for run 12890.

Figure 17: ADC counts in nonet versus time of maximum ADC counts in seed tower for run 12890

With the above corrections we have an estimate of the pulse height in each channel. We re-calculated \(ADC_{\mathit{nonet}}\) and also calculated the electron impact position by forming the ADC counts weighted sum of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) (in cell units) for the cells in the front calorimeter depth. Figure 18 is a scatter plot of the impact positions. Figures 19 and 20 show \(ADC_{\mathit{nonet}}\) versus \(\eta\) and versus \(\phi\) respectively.

In all runs the distribution of azimuthal angles, \(\phi\), was centred on cell 14 with a rather wide asymmetric distribution over the entire cell. The distribution in pseudorapidity, \(\eta\), was narrower and centre on a particular impact cell for each run. Rather than estimate corrections as a function of impact position we made tight cuts on the angles. We applied cuts around the mean impact position as follows: \(\left|\left\langle\eta\right\rangle-\eta\right|<0.05\) cell unit and \(\left|\left\langle\phi\right\rangle-\phi\right|<0.1\) cell unit.

After all of the above cuts we histogramed \(ADC_{\mathit{nonet}}\) for each electron run. The data taken after run 12898 (3 runs) are inconsistent with the other electron runs and have not been considered further. We are thus left with three runs with a 180 GeV beam and one run with a 100 GeV beam. We fit the \(ADC_{\mathit{nonet}}\) distributions to a simple gaussian resolution function and extracted the means and standard deviations. The results of the fits are shown in table 1. The percentage resolution numbers have the contribution from the beam momentum spread subtracted (\(\Delta p/p=25\%/p\oplus 0.5\%\)) [3]. The average conversion from ADC counts to energy is approximately 80 MeV/ADC count. Figure 2l show \(ADC_{\mathit{nonet}}\) for two different beam energies.

Figure 21: ADC counts in nonet for a) run 12890 (100 GeV) and b) run 12782 (180 GeV).

The resolution obtained with the standard RD3 electronics is

\[\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{9.99\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{0.28}{E}\oplus 0.35\%. \tag{3}\]

If we subtract the above sampling and constant terms from the resolutions in table 1, we obtain an average electronic noise with the pipeline system of about 850 MeV. The constant term in the above resolution formula was determined by applying impact-position corrections that were determined over the entire calorimeter. The constant term would be less if these corrections were determined from a single cell. Since we made no impact-position corrections in the analysis of the pipeline data but instead severely restricted the impact position, there is some uncertainty in using the above constant term.

We have also run the above electron analysis on three different pedestal runs and obtained an average noise for a nonet of channels of about 645 MeV. We consider this compatible with the above noise figure. From the noise in a nonet and the previously determined incoherent single-channel noise of about 100 MeV, we estimate a coherent noise over a nonet of about 18 MeV. We are in the process of improving our estimate of the coherent noise.

## 4 Conclusions

We have tested an analog pipeline readout system on the RD3 calorimeter. The incoherent noise of a single time sample for one channel was approximately 100 MeV, with a coherent noise over the channels in a nonet of calorimeter cells of about 18 MeV. The channel-to-channel time difference in a calorimeter depth was about 1 ns. The dynamic range of the pipeline system was 11.7 bit. The non-linearity was small and the channel-to-channel gain differences less than 13%. The ability to reconstruct electrons was demonstrated and the electronic noise contribution to the energy resolution was estimated to be 850 MeV. There is some uncertainty in this estimate of the noise due to the uncertainty of the constant term in our energy resolution. The main contribution to the coherent noise in the system was believed to be due to the power supply on the VME crate.

## Appendix B RD3 Data Recorded with SCA Readout

The RD3 data recorded with the switched capacitor array readout system is summarized in table 3.

## Appendix C Data Structure

Within the pipeline data block are five blocks of data; one for each readout module. The data for each module is divided into 10 sections; one for each time sample read out. The data for each sample consists of one address word, six data words, another address word, and another six data words. The first block of six data words contain the data for the odd channels in the readout module and the second six the even channels. Identical address words occur twice in the data block for the samples. Both types of word have the module number (0 to 4) in bits 28-30. An address word is distinguished from a data word by having the last bit set. The address words have the SCA read address in the first eight bits. Each data word contains the ADC values for two channels. The 12-bit ADC values are in bits 0-11
