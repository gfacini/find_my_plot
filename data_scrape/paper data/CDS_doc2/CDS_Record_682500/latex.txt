ABSTRACT

This note presents the results of a study of the detection sensitivity for the intermediate mass Higgs with the ATLAS detector through four muon final state. A full detector simulation and event reconstruction using the ATLAS muon spectrometer has been performed.

_Analysis submitted to the 97 EPS Conference_Introduction

Spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model gives rise to a fundamental massive neutral scalar particle, the Higgs boson (\(H^{0}\)). In the standard model the couplings of the Higgs boson to the fermions and the vector bosons are known, but the Higgs mass is not specified. Higgs searches have been performed at LEP (Large Electron-Positron Collider). So far the results of the searches have been negative, and the symmetry breaking mechanism remains mysterious. The current lower mass limit of the Higgs is 77 GeV [1]. It is expected that LEP II can reach the Higgs search limit up to \(M_{H}\sim 95\) GeV [2]. The Higgs search will remain a central topic of experimental high energy physics during the coming decade. The continuation of the search for the Higgs particle will be one of the main objectives of the LHC physics programme.

Much work has been carried out to understand the Higgs discovery potential of the ATLAS detector [3] for the LHC. This note reports the results of a study of the detection sensitivity for the intermediate mass Higgs (130 GeV \(<M_{H^{0}}<\) 180 GeV) with ATLAS detector through four muon final state. This study has been performed using a full detector simulation and event reconstruction with the ATLAS muon spectrometer. Our study confirmed that the ATLAS muon spectrometer performance will be achieved as described in the Technical Proposal (TP) submitted in 1994 [4].

## 2 Simulation Programs and Event Samples

The Higgs and background events were generated using PYTHIA program [5] with two proton beams colliding at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. The process cross sections and event samples used in this study are listed in Table 1a and 1b. One should notice that:

* The listed values of cross-section times the branching ratio (\(\sigma\times BR\)) for Higgs events were corrected using the values quoted in [6].
* The value of the \(\sigma\times BR\) for \(ZZ^{*}\) background has been increased by a factor of 1.3 to account for the gluon-gluon fusion contributions since the PYTHIA program doesn't include this interaction.
* The \(Zb\overline{b}\) process in PYTHIA is not usable to generate large statistical event sample due to an inappropriate treatment of the phase space. The background estimation from this channel has used results from previous studies [7].

Higgs event generation and reconstruction were carried out with full detector simulation. The detector simulation program used in this study is a GEANT-based package, LHCTOR [8]. The muon detector layout including the toroid coils of the magnet are modeled in detail, but we used simplified descriptions of the inner tracker and calorimeters. All the physics processes for particles interacting with the detector, such as \(\delta\)-ray production and dE/dx energy loss, are operative for all the simulations. Muon detector digitization and muon track reconstruction were performed using program MUONBOX [9]. This package takes account of the detector inefficiencies chamber resolutions and alignment errors (for both precision tracking device (MDTs) and trigger detectors). Nominal background random hits are also included during the 'digitization' process. Under simulated realistic conditions, MUONBOX performs the muon track pattern recognition and momentum reconstruction in muon chambers. Back-fitting of the muon tracks was carried out using program BMCBOX [10]. This program performs the back-tracking of the muons to the IP (Interaction Point) while adding back the energy loss due to \(dE/dx\) and radiation to the reconstructed muon momentum using muon chamber data alone. In addition, the kinematic constraint of the \(Z^{0}\) mass was performed using MINUIT program package [11] to improve the Higgs mass resolution. Figure 1a-1c show the reconstructed Higgs mass distributions, based on the muon system alone, for Higgs mass of 130 GeV, 150 GeV and 170GeV, respectively. Typical non-Gaussian tails of these distributions are about 15%. These tails are mostly due to missing multi-layer hits in the muon detection because of the muon detector geometric acceptance and because of energy loss fluctuationsss.

Due to CPU limitations, background studies were carried out using a fast simulation package, ATLFAST [12] with very large event samples. The background study performed here provides an independent cross-check of the background contributions for the previous studies done [7]. In these latter studies, the background studies were carried out using full detector simulations of the ATLAS inner detector. Therefore, for our calculations for the final detection sensitivity we have used the estimated backgrounds quoted in [7].

## 3 Event Selection and Efficiency

We have followed the event selection strategy described in the ATLAS TP to identify the Higgs events and to reject the backgrounds. The selection criteria are listed below.

1. **Kinematic requirements** The following kinematic selection cuts were designed to match the muon triggers and to reject the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Z^{0}b\overline{b}\) background: 1. Rapidity cut for each muon: \(|\eta_{\mu}|<2.7\). 2. Transverse momentum, \(P_{T}^{\mu}\), for each muon should be greater than 7 GeV, and at least two muons should have \(P_{T}^{\mu}\) greater than 20 GeV. 3. The di-muon invariant mass of one selected pair of muons should be consistent with the \(Z^{0}\) mass: \(|M_{\mu\mu}-M_{Z^{0}}|<6\) GeV. 4. The other pair of muons should have an invariant mass greater than 20 GeV. The detection efficiencies obtained from the full simulations and reconstructions for different Higgs masses are listed in Table 2, ranging from 27% to 56.7% for masses between 130 GeV and 170 GeV.
2. **Isolation requirement** The \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Z^{0}b\overline{b}\) backgrounds contain muons from \(b\!/c\) decays, which are therefore not isolated. We required all the muons in the final state to be isolated in a cone of radius \(R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.2\) around the muon track. The signal efficiency for applying the isolation cut using the calorimeters in ATLFAST is greater than 98%. More realistic study using inner tracker to perform the isolation cut gives 90% detection efficiency at low luminosity (3 years\(\times 10^{33}/cm^{2}/sec\)), and \(\sim 80\%\) at high luminosity (\(10^{34}/cm^{2}/sec\)). In our signal efficiency calculations, we have used the efficiencies of 90% and 80% for low- and high-luminosity, respectively.
3. **Missing transverse energy cut** To reject the \(t\overline{t}\) background, we required the missing transverse energy for each event should be less than 40 GeV. The signal efficiency is greater than 99% when applying this cut.
4. **Impact parameter cut** An impact parameter cut was performed with full inner detector simulations [7] with the goal to further remove the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Z^{0}\,b\overline{b}\) background far below the irreducible background from the \(ZZ^{*}\) process. The signal efficiency quoted in [7] is about 90% at low luminosity, and about 73% at high luminosity. In this study, we directly use these efficiencies in the detection sensitivity calculations.

Table 2 lists the overall Higgs signal detection efficiencies for low - and high - luminosity, respectively. Where \(\epsilon_{kin}\) is the kinematic cut efficiency, and obtained from full muon detector simulations; \(\epsilon_{ii}\) is the product of the isolation cut efficiency and the impact parameter cut efficiency: \(\epsilon_{ii}=\epsilon_{ isolation}\times\epsilon_{impact}\), coming from [7]; \(\epsilon_{all}=\epsilon_{kin}\times\epsilon_{ii}\). In this table we also give the mass reconstruction resolution \(\sigma_{M}\) and event percentage in \(M\pm 2\sigma_{M}\) region for different Higgs masses. These numbers will be used in calculating the Higgs detection sensitivities in next section.

**Table 2**: Signal detection efficiencies

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{Mass} & \(\epsilon_{kin}\,(\%)\) & \(\epsilon_{ii}\,(\%)\) & \(\epsilon_{all}\,(\%)\) & \(\epsilon_{ii}\,(\%)\) & \(\epsilon_{all}\,(\%)\) & \(\sigma_{M}\) & \% in \\ \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{(GeV)} & & low lumi. & low lumi. & high lumi. & high lumi. & (GeV) & \(M\pm 2\sigma\) \\ \hline
130 & 28.0 & 81.0 & 22.7 & 58.0 & 15.7 & 2.0 & 81.0\(\pm\)3 \\
140 & 38.3 & 81.0 & 31.0 & 58.0 & 22.2 & 2.2 & 81.0\(\pm\)3 \\
150 & 45.9 & 81.0 & 37.2 & 58.0 & 26.6 & 2.6 & 85.3\(\pm\)3 \\
160 & 54.4 & 81.0 & 44.1 & 58.0 & 31.6 & 2.8 & 81.0\(\pm\)3 \\
170 & 56.7 & 81.0 & 45.9 & 58.0 & 32.9 & 3.0 & 85.0\(\pm\)3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The background rejection factor corresponding to the above signal efficiencies are 1200 and 105 for \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Zb\overline{b}\), respectively [7]. As a cross-check, using fast simulations and applying the event selection cuts 1 - 3 listed above to the \(ZZ^{*}\) and \(t\overline{t}\) background samples, the following were found. a) The \(ZZ^{*}\) background contributes 36.5 events for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) in the mass range 110 - 180 GeV at the low luminosity. This background corresponds to 0.52 event per GeV in mass distribution. b) \(\sim\) 0.02 event per GeV in mass distribution come from the \(t\overline{t}\) process for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The summed background from the \(Zb\overline{b}\) process is three times the \(t\overline{t}\) background, implying the overall background between 110-180 GeV is 0.6 events/GeV in the mass distributions. One should notice that these background rates don't include the rejection power using the impact parameter requirement and these estimates are about a factor of 2 higher than the background rate quoted in [7].

## 4 Higgs Detection Sensitivity

In this section we present our calculations of the Higgs detection sensitivities through four muon final state for low and high luminosities. The expected Higgs events produced at the LHC with \(10^{5}\) luminosity are taken from Table 1. The signal detection efficiencies are derived from Table 2. In addition a 9% signal reduction is used in order to take into account the inner bremsstrahlung process at the generator level (since PYTHIA program doesn't include such process). The background events are estimated using the numbers listed in Table 2 in [7], and normalized to \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity (both for low- and high-luminosity). Sensitivity is defined as \(S/\sqrt{B}\), where \(S\) denotes the number of accepted signal events within the mass region of \(M\pm 2\sigma_{M}\), and \(B\), the number of accepted background events in the same mass region as the signal.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \multicolumn{4}{c}{**Table 3a: Higgs detection sensitivity**} \\ through \(pp\to ZZ^{*}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (high luminosity) \\ \hline \(M_{H}\) & Signal & Background & \(S/\sqrt{B}\) \\ (GeV) & & & \\ \hline
130 & 8.5 & 2.7 & 5.2 \\
140 & 19.6 & 1.7 & 15.0 \\
150 & 28.3 & 1.9 & 20.5 \\
160 & 14.7 & 1.8 & 11.0 \\
170 & 8.8 & 1.9 & 6.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Tables 3a and 3b list the expected rates for Higgs events and backgrounds for different Higgs masses, as well as the expected significances at high- and low-luminosity, respectively.

Another way to define the Higgs detection sensitivity is to define required luminosity for a 5\(\sigma\) discovery criteria, namely, the probability for a false discovery claim is less than 2.9\(\times 10^{-5}\). Fig. 2a shows the required integrated luminosity for discovery versus the Higgs mass at high luminosity. Fig. 2b shows the required integrated luminosity for discovery versus the Higgs mass at low luminosity.

## 5 Combining the Muon Measurement with the Inner Tracker

Combining the muon measurement with the inner tracker, we expect to improve the mass resolutions and the tails in the mass distribution. The detection sensitivity is thus expected to increase. For these studies we used the fast simulation package ATLFAST which gives a realistic estimate of the muon resolution. The tracker momentum resolution can be parametrized as

\[dp_{T}/p_{T}=0.0005p_{T}+0.012\]

over most of the \(\eta\)-range, except for \(|\eta|\geq 2\) where the resolution degrades. The combined measurement of the muon 4-momentum, \(p_{final}\), has been evaluated as:

\[p_{final}=\frac{1}{w}\left(p_{muon}/\sigma_{muon}^{2}+p_{track}/\sigma_{track }^{2}\right)\]with \(w=(1/\sigma_{m}^{2}+1/\sigma_{track}^{2})\).

Figure 3a shows the reconstructed mass distribution for 130 GeV Higgs decays measured by the muon spectrometer alone (ATLFAST). The mass resolution is \(\sigma_{M}/M=2.0\) GeV, which is in agreement with the full simulation (MUONBOX). Figure 3b shows the reconstructed mass distribution for 130 GeV Higgs decays using the combined information from the muon spectrometer and the inner tracker. The mass resolution is \(\sigma_{M}/M=1.3\) GeV. The tails of the mass distribution are significantly smaller. The non-Gaussian tails of the two distributions using the fast simulation is 9% for using the muon spectrometer alone, and 3% for using the combined information from the muon spectrometer and the inner tracker compared to 15% with the full simulation.

Detailed studies of full simulations combining the measurements from the inner tracker and from the muon spectrometer will be carried out in the near future. From the fast simulations, we expect that non-Gaussian tails in the mass distributions will decrease substantially, thereby improving our detection sensitivity.

## 6 Conclusion

Our simulations of the intermediate mass Higgs detection sensitivities through the four muon final state show that the ATLAS muon spectrometer offers a good discovery potential in agreement with the earlier studies included in the ATLAS TP. We are confident that the ATLAS muon detector will have a good chance of observing the Higgs scalar with a clean signature in the Higgs mass region greater than 130 GeV.
