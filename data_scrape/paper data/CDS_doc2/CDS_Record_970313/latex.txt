_This is a revised version of the ATL-PHYS-PUB-2006-024 note, which also superseeds the corresponding section in_ TeV4LHC Report: Preparations for Discoveries _(hep-ph/0608322)_.

**Abstract**

_In this note, we develop a model independent determination of the ATLAS efficiency in detecting \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons decaying to an electron positron pair. This efficiency is then applied to the cross section predicted in the CDDT parameterization of \(Z^{\prime}\) models, a model independent parameterization already used by CDF. We then derive the ATLAS Z' discovery potential in this framework. Finally we compare this potential to the results from other colliders, LEP and TeVatron._

The existence of an additional spin 1 neutral boson -denoted as \(Z^{\prime}\) in this note- is predicted in many extensions of the Standard Model (SM), such as \(E_{6}\) or \(SO(10)\) Grand Unified Theories, extra dimensions theories, little Higgs models...

At the LHC, the \(Z^{\prime}\) production process mainly consists in a quark-antiquark annihilation, the \(u\bar{u}\) and \(d\bar{d}\) cases being largely dominant in most models1. In all the following, only decays to known particles are considered; because of the high QCD background, there is very little hope to detect the hadronic decays of a \(Z^{\prime}\) boson; with a large missing energy coming from two neutrinos, the \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) decay is also a very challenging channel. With the Drell Yan process as unique irreducible background and a very limited reducible background, the electron and muon channels are much more promising andcan be considered as golden channels to discover a new neutral gauge boson. Up to \(Z^{\prime}\) masses of about 5 TeV, the signature simply consists in a high invariant mass peak above the Drell Yan line shape.

In this note, the ATLAS potential in term of discovery of a \(Z^{\prime}\) decaying to an electron-positron pair is studied. It is especially detailed in the CDDT parameterization[1] adopted by the CDF collaboration[2]; this parameterization takes into account both experimental limits and general theoretical assumptions to constrain the models with an additionnal neutral gauge boson. Given these, four classes of solutions are found, three parameters remaining totally free in the four classes; these parameters are the mass of the additionnal gauge boson, \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\), the global coupling strength, \(g_{Z^{\prime}}\), and a parameter \(x\) describing the relative coupling strength to the different fermions. An original method to extract a realistic efficiency depending on the model is presented. Since the reducible background is expected to be small, only the irreducible background was considered.

## 1 Samples

In order to study the reconstruction efficiency in a realistic context, several samples of \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma/Z/Z^{\prime}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events were generated with PYTHIA[3], and simulated with GEANT 3 for the ATLAS detector response. The response of the particles with a pseudo-rapidity out of the range [-2.5,2.5] was not simulated. The events were then reconstructed in the official ATLAS reconstruction framework[4].

The samples were generated with two different \(Z^{\prime}\) masses (1.5 TeV and 4 TeV) and for a variety \(\mbox{models}-\mbox{SM}\) like, \(E_{6}\) derived models, Left-Right model - each model being fully determined by its coupling constants to the known fermions. The knowledge of the exact characteristics of these models, which can be found in [5], is not useful here since a model independent approach was chosen. The CTEQ5L parton distribution functions were used and initial/final state radiations were switched on. A total of 150,000 events with di-electron masses above 500 GeV and 15,000 above 2000 GeV were simulated.

## 2 Event selection

First the electron (positron) candidates are reconstructed using the standard ATLAS electron identification: additionally to criteria on shower shape and energy leakage, one requires to have a good track quality, with a total number of hits in the tracking detectors greater than 6. The absence of any additional track in a broad cone (0.05 in \(\eta\) and 0.1 in \(\phi\)) around the matched track is also required in order to reduce the QCD and tau backgrounds.

Although being optimized on low energy electrons, these simple criteria lead to satisfactory results with reasonable angular and energy resolutions (see figure 1) and an acceptable efficiency; this procedure will have to be optimized in a near future but is good enough for our present purpose.

Only events with exactly two electrons candidates are kept; these two candidates were also required to be isolated in the calorimeter, i.e. with no cluster of transverse energy greater than 40 GeV in a cone of radius \(\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}\) equal to 0.5.

Finally, the two reconstructed electrons must be of opposite charge and back to back in the transverse plane, the absolute difference of azimuthal angles having to be greater than 2.9 radians.

The typical efficiencies for this selection are detailed in table 1 for a sample of SM like \(Z^{\prime}\) generated with a mass of 1.5 TeV.

## 3 Model dependence of the efficiency.

With a full detector simulation and the use of the official ATLAS reconstruction framework, the efficiency estimate can be considered as realistic. Nevertheless, it strongly depends on the \(Z^{\prime}\) mass and on the underlying

model; therefore it cannot be used to derive any model independent limit.

The different leptons kinematic characteristics, directly inducing different detector efficiencies, can be controlled by considering two characteristics of the model : the forward backward asymmetry (related to the coupling constants to quark and leptons), and the \(Z^{\prime}\) boost distribution (related to the \(Z^{\prime}\) mass and the coupling constants to quarks).

Introducing the angle \(cos\theta^{\star}\) -the angle between the negative lepton and the incoming quark in the \(Z^{\prime}\) rest frame-, the \(Z^{\prime}\) production cross section is:

\[\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta^{\star}}\propto\frac{3}{8}(1+\cos^{2}\theta^{\star })+A_{FB}\cos\theta^{\star} \tag{1}\]

The \(A_{FB}\) coefficient depends on the boson coupling constants to incoming quarks and decay products and therefore strongly depends on the underlying model; this coefficient however vanishes when integrating over two \(cos\theta^{\star}\) intervals symmetric around 0. Keeping in mind that flipping the \(cos\theta^{\star}\) sign corresponds to swapping the electron and the positron, one can deduce the following property: in any positive (or negative) interval of pseudo rapidity in the \(Z^{\prime}\) rest frame, the total number of leptons, electrons plus positrons, is independent of the \(A_{FB}\) coefficient. Therefore, if the detector is assumed to have equivalent detection and reconstruction efficiencies for electron and positron, the event selection efficiency does not depend on the \(A_{FB}\) coefficient; this however does not mean that it is independent on the model, since the \(Z^{\prime}\) boost still has to be taken into account. There is however a way to control this effect, as explained below. Notice that a forward/backward asymmetric efficiency does not spoil this result since the LHC is a pp collider, and hence the probability for the incoming quark to be forward is the same as the probability for the incoming antiquark.

The \(Z^{\prime}\) boost can be deduced from its mass and its rapidity. The \(Z^{\prime}\) rapidity distribution is represented on figure 2 (left) for two different models.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline At least two electrons with \(|\eta|<2.5\) & (82.1\(\pm\)0.3 )\% \\ \hline \hline At least two identified and isolated electrons & (57.1\(\pm\)0.4 ) \% \\ \hline Electrons candidate of opposite charge & (53.4\(\pm\)0.4 ) \% \\ \hline Electrons candidate back to back & (45.9\(\pm\)0.4 ) \% \\ \hline \hline Accepted events & (45.9\(\pm\)0.4 ) \% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Step by step event selection efficiency - SM like \(Z^{\prime}\) with a mass of 1.5 TeVTheir shapes are different only due to the different \(u/d\) parton density functions in the proton and, because of different coupling constants of the \(Z^{\prime}\) to \(u\) and \(d\), due to the different fractions of di-electron coming from \(u\bar{u}\) and \(d\bar{d}\). When splitting each sample in two subsamples according on the incoming quark flavour, all \(Z^{\prime}\) rapidity distributions become similar, independently of the model as can be seen on figure 1(b).

The same is true for the leptons decaying from the \(Z^{\prime}\) : for a given \(Z^{\prime}\) mass, their kinematic properties only depend on the flavour of the incoming quarks. Consequently, an average reconstruction efficiency can be extracted event by event in any \(Z^{\prime}\) model, with the only knowledge of the incoming quark flavour and the effective \(Z^{\prime}\) mass. These efficiencies are summarized on figure 3 for the two main quark flavours, including the intermediate efficiencies for each selection step2.

Footnote 2: The variable bin size was chosen in order to optimize the number of events by bins.

In both cases, one observes an increase of the number of events fully contained in the considered detector acceptance, when the di-electron mass becomes larger: this is a pure kinematic effect, the leptons being less boosted at large \(Z^{\prime}\) mass. This effect is however counterbalanced by a degraded electron reconstruction efficiency; this can be explained by the fact that the electron identification algorithm is optimized on low energy electrons;

Figure 2: \(Z^{\prime}\) rapidity for two different \(E_{6}\) models in the mass range [1.48 TeV,1.52 TeV] (\(M_{Z^{\prime}}=1.5\)TeV)

there is some hope to recover from such effect by tuning the algorithm for higher energy objects. When the electron transverse momentum becomes larger, the detector charge identification is degraded, whereas the accuracy on the azymuthal angle measurement is improved. Consequently, at higher di-electron mass, the efficiency related to the charge criterion becomes lower and, on the opposite, the efficiency related to the acoplanarity becomes higher.

Finally, the reconstruction efficiency of the \(d\vec{d}\to Z^{\prime}\) is found to be always higher than the one of the \(u\bar{u}\to Z^{\prime}\). This can be explained by the particle density function differences, the \(d\) quark one being less peaked at low x, therefore inducing less boosted events, and consequently events which are more contained in the detector.

These efficiencies can be exploited in two ways:

* considering only a cross section production and ignoring the incoming quark flavour, the \(u\bar{u}\) efficiency can be taken conservatively in order to derive a discovery reach or an exclusion limit.
* in the context of a given model, where the relative fractions of incoming \(u\) and \(d\) quarks are known, the discovery reach and exclusion limit can be precisely extracted.

With a limited number of generated and simulated Monte Carlo events, it is therefore possible to derive realistic limits with reasonable reconstruction efficiency in any model. In any case, this reconstruction efficiency is more realistic than the ones estimated with a fast detector simulation.

ATLAS discovery reach.

The four classes of CDDT solutions were considered with three different values of the \(g_{Z^{\prime}}\) coupling strength, and a wide range of \(x\) parameter values. The events generated by Pythia were efficiency weighted according to the incoming quark flavour and \(Z^{\prime}\) mass, as explained in the previous section, in order to derive an effective production cross section. This procedure was also applied to the irreducible background. Then a significance estimator, called \(2S_{12}[6]\), was used in order to extract the discovery reach in the \((x,g_{Z^{\prime}}/M_{Z^{\prime}})\) plane for several values of integrated luminosities. This estimator is defined by \(2S_{12}=2\times(\sqrt{S+B}-\sqrt{B})\) where \(S\) (resp. \(B\)) is the expected number of signal (resp. background) events; this definition has been shown to be more realistic than the usual \(S/\sqrt{B}\) or \(S/\sqrt{S+B}\).

The results are presented on figures 4 and 5 for two different values of luminosities : 400 \(pb^{-1}\) and 100 \(fb^{-1}\). The ATLAS discovery reach goes beyond the LEP exclusion limits in most scenarios, already in the first months of LHC running (400 \(pb^{-1}\) case); furthermore, with such a limited luminosity, it is also possible to probe large regions of parameters space not yet excluded by CDF. The long term limits (100 \(fb^{-1}\) case), as for them, illustrate the very promising LHC discovery potential which is, as expected, far beyond the ultimate TeVatron one. This would be even more striking when including expected analysis refinements, such as : optimization of the electron reconstruction, including the forward backward asymmetry measurement as done by CDF,...

## 5 Conclusions.

The ATLAS \(Z^{\prime}\) discovery reach has been presented in the context of the CDDT parameterization, by taking into account the efficiency, derived from a detector full simulation, independently of the model. The potential was found to be very promising, even with a limited amount of data.
