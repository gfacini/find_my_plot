**Abstract**

Preliminary results on pattern recognition for ATLAS Silicon Tracker and Vertex Detector were obtained. The recent changes in the Inner Detector concept made some of the geometrical assumptions used for this work obsolete. It is also understood, that stand-alone pattern recognition performance should not be an ultimate criteria for a concept of any ID component. We think nevertheless, that stand-alone abilities are interesting to some extent, and that some observations made during this work could be useful in the present period of discussions.

## 1 Detector model

As a simulation tool SLUG/DICE program was used. Active layers of SITV detector were defined in GEANT in the approximate way and had a shape of cones (figure 1a).

During the digitization step individual silicon plates were defined. It was possible to change the plate positions slightly. Figures 1b and c show two geometrical arrangements which were used (see section 4). Hits were projected from cones to plates according to track directions. At this stage nature of a plate had to be chosen. The following possibilities were included in the program:

\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline layer type & description \\ \hline
1 & single sided strips, \(50\mu m\) pitch \\
2 & double sided strips, \(50\mu m\) pitch on one side and \(200\mu m\) on the another, \(90^{\circ}\) crossing angle \\
3 & double sided strips, \(50\mu m\) both sides, small stereo angle \\ P & \(50\mu m\) x \(200\mu m\) pixels \\ \hline \end{tabular} For strips having \(50\mu m\) pitch the resolution of \(20\mu m\) including alignment was assumed. Two track resolution was \(150\mu m\). For \(200\mu m\) pitch the values were \(40\mu m\) and \(600\mu m\) respectively. In case of double sided strip detectors ambiguity effect was taken into account.

Pattern recognition program

Pattern recognition program was rather simple and has to be considered preliminary. It was supposed to provide the first insight into the problems and to be replaced by something more refined, using all the inner tracker components, faster and more efficient. The following criteria was used to find the tracks:

1. Hits should belong to a road containing the expected high \(p_{T}\) track. In \(\Phi\) the road size was 20\({}^{\circ}\), in \(z\) the size was 10\(cm\) at \(R=30cm\) and 25\(cm\) at \(R=0\). This includes the uncertainty on the z position of the primary vertex.
2. For every two neighboring points of a track candidate the angle \(\alpha\) between the line going through points and the direction towards the beam spot in \(R\Phi\) plane was calculated. The combination was rejected if \(\alpha\) was bigger than 10\({}^{\circ}\) for any two points.
3. For every set of 6 points fulfilling the above a helix fit in space was performed. The \(\chi^{2}\) cut was used to reject fake hit combinations.

Steps 1 and 2 were taken in order to reduce the number of combinations to which the helix is fitted. The algorithm is still very combinatorial. The helix is fitted many times per event and the CPU time needed to analyze one event limits the statistics seriously.

## 3 High \(P_{\perp}\) track on top of minimum bias pile-up.

100 GeV electron tracks was added on top of a pileup of 60 minimum bias events. In this conditions we are interested in finding the _high momentum track only_. As a consequence all the other reconstructed tracks are by definition called 'fake' here. Probably a fraction of this tracks are low momentum ones really existing in the analyzed events, but full event reconstruction was not the goal of this exercise. The approach was rather pessimistic on the start.

The detector consisted of single sided microstrip modules (layer type 1) only. A \(\chi^{2}\) distribution for real and fake tracks is shown in figure 2a. A cut on \(\chi^{2}\) = 1.8 leads to an acceptance for real tracks of 97%. Fraction of fake tracks among the all reconstructed is 40%. It turns out however, that 'fake' tracks usually have relatively low \(P_{\perp}\). Figure 2b shows the same distribution when \(P_{\perp}>10\) GeV is required. Acceptance for real tracks stays the same while the fraction of 'fakes' drops to 5%. This number could be further decreased by making a transverse momentum cut higher.

It was concluded from this, that high momentum track finding even in the presence of a big pile-up should be an easier task then the one which is discussed next. The same observation at the level of 20 minimum bias events was already made in [1]. Further work was devoted to the study of the more difficult case of jet events.

## 4 Jet events

\(t\bar{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\bar{b}\to l\nu q\bar{q}b\bar{b}\) (\(l\) = \(e\) or \(\mu\)) events for \(m_{top}\) = 130 GeV were analyzed. This is an example of events in which track finding down to relatively low \(P_{\perp}\) of the order of 1 GeV is needed for impact parameter based \(b\)-jet tagging [2].

Different SITV layer types were tested. The layer type naming used in the table is described in section 1. '0' means a layer switched-off, present as a material but not used.

Description of symbols used in the table:

events - number of events analyzed within reasonable CPU time, namely 1440 normalized CPU minutes on CERNVM

 hits - number of reconstructed hits in a detector, goes down with overlaps in projection on a plate (for strips) and goes up with ambiguous combinations for 90\({}^{\circ}\) double sided strips

 helix - an average number of times a helix is fitted per event

 accept. - acceptance for true tracks, kept approximately constant using a varying \(\chi^{2}\) cut (between 2.0 and 2.5)

 fakes - fraction of fakes among reconstructed tracks

\(b\)-tag - a parameter describing \(b\)-tagging performance: rejection against non-\(b\) jets for 50% \(b\)-jet acceptance

 The last line of the table, marked with a '*' deserves special attention. It corresponds to a different geometrical setup. The module placement used in all other cases is shown in figure 1b. In case of the last table line layers 1 and 6 were placed as always, while all the others were shifted to make a gap inside a double layer wider and the layer distribution more uniform. This setup is shown in figure 1c. There are two consequences of the layer placement change. A number of times a helix is fitted increases and so does the CPU time consumption. This is a consequence of purely technical nature related to simulations. What is more important is a relatively small but significant drop in the number of fake tracks. This indicates, that from the pattern recognition point of view it seems better to distribute the layers uniformly in R.

When double sided detectors having orthogonal strip directions are used the number of reconstructed hits increases because of ambiguous combinations. This combinations are so common, especially in jets, that the CPU time consumption increases dramatically. It made it impossible to test layer combinations where more than 3 type '2' layers were used. It is not excluded that such a combination could perform well however.

There is no big reduction in the number of fake tracks if only two layers having a resolution in \(z\) are used and all the other are made of single sided strip detectors. Pixels combined with double-sided strips are a successful choice, but 6 layers of double sided small stereo angle have a low rate of fakes too.

In order to check the actual importance of fake tracks a \(b\)-tagging exercise has been made for the geometries for which the program is not too slow. Obtained results have been compared with those of the reference [2]. In all cases the performances were worse than in [2], where for 50% acceptance of b-jets one would expect a rejection factor of around 10 for non-\(b\) jets. The difference is in part due to pattern recognition problems (which were not taken into account in [2]), and in part due to the fact that also the impact parameter resolution deteriorates if only SITV points are used, like in this study. The difference between 11 11 11 and PP 33 33 in the table is also significant. Fake tracks have non-zero impact parameters and their presence obscures the difference between \(b\)-jets and non-\(b\) jets. Good pattern recognition performance is essential for \(b\)-tagging.

When one layer gets switched-off the number of fake tracks increases by about 50%. This means, that if the number of silicon layers at small radii is to be reduced we will have to rely strongly on help from outside. It remains to be shown that pattern recognition in jets will be feasible in such case.

## 5 Conclusions

It is believed now, that full reconstruction of jet events is a serious pattern recognition challenge, more difficult than tracking confined to high \(P_{\perp}\) tracks foreseen for high luminosity conditions [1], [3]. Efficient track finding is essential for impact parameter based \(b\)-jet tagging. With Inner Detector down-grading in view, it will be very important to test the performance of any new tracker concept in this aspect. It has been tested, that 6 layer SITV can find tracks within jets, to some extent even stand-alone.
