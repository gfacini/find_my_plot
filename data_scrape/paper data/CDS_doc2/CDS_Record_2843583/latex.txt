[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]

This document reproduces, on the following pages, the original August 2012 proposal for the device that became the FELIX (Front End LInk eXchange) element in the ATLAS Data Acquisition system.

The Front End Link eXchange (FELIX) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], developed by the ATLAS Trigger and DAQ project, replaces the previous ATLAS Front End readout architecture. FELIX separates data transport from data processing: data are transported by FELIX, a detector neutral custom hardware/software device; data are processed by detector-specific software running on servers. FELIX interfaces multi-gigabit per second optical links, from ASIC's that aggregate several slow serial copper "E-links" (GBTx [6, 7], lpGBT [8]) or from FPGA's, to an industry standard Ethernet network. These links carry readout, calibration and detector monitoring data from the Front End, and configuration and control data to the Front End. Acting similarly to a network switch, FELIX routes these links individually between Front End electronics and the relevant software processes on the network. It also distributes the TTC (Timing, Trigger and Control) signals [9], including the LHC Bunch Crossing clock, to the Front End electronics via dedicated E-links. FELIX provides a common platform for some ATLAS LHC Run 3 subsystems and will do so for all ATLAS LHC Run 4 subsystems. FELIX is built from custom PCIe FPGA cards [4] hosted in commercial Linux servers, each equipped with a high-performance Ethernet interface card. The use of commodity components and the sharing of a common platform by all sub-detectors reduces hardware, firmware and software effort.

An addition reference to the cited GLIB board may be found here [10].
