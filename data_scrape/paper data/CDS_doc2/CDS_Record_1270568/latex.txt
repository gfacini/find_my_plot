Prospects for Higgs boson searches using the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) decay mode with the ATLAS detector at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) 

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The prospects for Higgs boson searches using the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) (\(\ell=e,\mu\)) decay mode at ATLAS are presented, including realistic detector effects and a discussion of methods to estimate the backgrounds and systematic errors. Events are separated into three sets of analyses according to the hadronic jet multiplicity. The sensitivity of the ATLAS detector is computed for 10  proton-proton centre-of-mass energy and assuming a data set of an integrated luminosity of \(200\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). With these conditions a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass in the range \(160-170\)  can be excluded with a 95% confidence level.

Introduction

In the Standard Model there is one particle, the Higgs boson, that is responsible for giving masses to all of the other particles [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. One of the most exciting prospects for the LHC is the observation of the Higgs boson.

The direct search at the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) collider LEP has led to a lower bound on the Higgs boson mass, \(m_{H}\), of \(114.4\,\mathrm{GeV}\)[7]. Indirectly, high precision electroweak data constrain the mass of the Higgs boson via their sensitivity to loop corrections. Assuming the overall validity of the Standard Model, a global fit [8] to all electroweak data leads to the 95% confidence level (C.L.) limit \(m_{H}<157\,\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). Direct searches at the Tevatron yield a 95% C.L. exclusion for Higgs boson masses in the range \(163<m_{H}<166\,\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\)[9, 10].

The search using the decay mode \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to\ell\nu\ell\nu,(l=e,\mu)\) gives strong sensitivity to the SM Higgs boson in the intermediate mass range of \(130<m_{H}<200\,\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\)[11, 12, 13, 14, 15]. The feasibility of Higgs boson searches with the ATLAS detector has been extensively studied and reported in Refs. [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21] for a proton-proton centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) and integrated luminosity of \(10-30\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). This paper discusses the sensitivity of the ATLAS detector with \(\sqrt{s}=10\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) and an integrated luminosity of \(200\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) using the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) decay mode based on a realistic full detector simulation.

Three disjoint analyses are defined according to the hadronic jet multiplicity in the event; they are denoted as the \(H+0j\), \(H+1j\), and \(H+2j\) analyses. Special emphasis is placed on in-situ control samples that can be used to estimate the background contributions using data and on the systematic uncertainties associated with these background determination methods.

The paper is organised as follows: Section 2 gives a description of the Monte Carlo (MC) samples used in the study. Section 3 describes the trigger selection, and Section 4 describes the criteria used to select physics objects such as electrons and muons. Section 5 gives account of the event selection, and Section 6 reports on the various methods for the estimation of backgrounds. The summary of the systematic uncertainties of the backgrounds used in the calculation of the exclusion potential is given in Section 7. Finally, Section 8 reports the sensitivity in terms of the 95% C.L. exclusion limit as a function of the Higgs boson mass.

## 2 Physics Processes and Monte Carlo

This section describes the various signal and background processes important to this study, as well as the Monte Carlo generators used to model them. All processes are generated with a centre-of-mass energy of \(10\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). The cross sections for signal and background processes used here correspond to different levels of theoretical accuracy.

### Signal Processes

The studies in this note focus on the detection of Higgs bosons which decay to \(W\) pairs. In order to suppress large backgrounds from QCD multijet production, the analyses presented here consider events containing two charged leptons (\(e\), \(\mu\)) and missing transverse energy carried by escaping neutrinos, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\,\mathrm{miss}}\). There are two Higgs boson production processes that are important to these searches. The gluon fusion process (ggF) is the leading production mechanism. The Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) process displays two widely separated jets. The charged leptons of the decay of a \(W\) boson pair from a spin-0 particle tend to be observed in the same direction [12, 22, 23]. This leads to final states in which the azimuthal opening angle between the charged leptons is small while the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\,\mathrm{miss}}\) is large. This is used to suppress background processes. These signal processes are modelled with the following Monte Carlo generators:

* \(H\to WW^{(*)}\) signal via gluon fusion: A representative leading order Feynman diagram is shown in Fig. 1 a). It is the dominant signal process in the \(H+0j\) and the \(H+1j\) analyses. This process is modelled using the generator provided in MC@NLO [24]1), which provides next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD corrections in addition to a good description of multiple soft-gluon emission at the next-to-next-to-leading Log Level (NNLL). The generator is configured so that \(W\) bosons decay only to \(e\nu\) or \(\mu\nu\); the contribution from signal events containing \(W\to\tau\nu\) decays is not taken into account. The addition of the \(W\to\tau\nu\) would enhance the signal yield by about 10%. Footnote 1): The spin correlation is taken into account by the modified version of HERWIG. The detailed MC generator study is shown in Ref. [25]
* \(H\to WW^{(*)}\) signal via Vector Boson Fusion. A representative leading order Feynman diagram is shown in Fig. 1 b). The outgoing quarks have a transverse momentum of order of half the \(W\) boson mass and fall with high probability within the detector acceptance, thus giving rise to two jets, which are often well separated; they provide an additional handle which can be used together with the two leptons and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) from the Higgs boson decay to suppress backgrounds. The VBF process is modelled using HERWIG [26]. Both \(W\) bosons are forced to decay leptonically \((e,\mu)\) at the generator level.

The studies presented here consider the Higgs boson in the mass range from 130 to 200 GeV. Table 1 shows the production cross sections for the two signal processes times the branching ratio for \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) as functions of the Higgs boson mass.

### Background Processes

A number of processes give rise to signatures similar to the signal processes described above:

* Continuum \(WW\) production: This process is the dominant background contribution to the \(H+0j\) analysis. The \(qq/qg\to WW\) process is modelled using MC@NLO. The loop-induced \(gg\to WW\) contribution is not negligible due to the large gluon flux at the LHC. This process is generated

by gg2WW [27] with a filter requirement of at least one charged lepton with \(p_{\rm T}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.7\). In the \(H+2j\) analysis, the process \(qq\to WWqq\) is relevant. Therefore, the \(WW\)+jets process is modelled using ALPGEN with matrix elements including up to three partons using the MLM matching framework [28, 29]. ALPGEN calculates a leading-order (LO) cross section, so it is scaled to NLO with a \(K\)-factor of 1.21 [19, 30]. \(W\) bosons are forced to decay leptonically (\(e,\mu,\tau\)) in all \(WW\) background samples.
* \(t\bar{t}\) and single top production comprising \(s\)-channel (\(s\)-ch), \(t\)-channel (\(t\)-ch) and \(Wt\): \(t\bar{t}\) production is expected to be the dominant background in the \(H+2j\) analysis. Events from the \(t\bar{t}\) process are generated using MC@NLO; events where both \(W\) bosons decay hadronically are filtered out. The generated NLO cross section is scaled to the approximate NNLO cross section with a \(K\)-factor of 1.07 [31]. The contribution from \(Wt\) is modelled using AcerMC [32], and the \(W\) boson is forced to decay leptonically. The sum of the \(t\bar{t}\) and the single top production is also referred to as top backgrounds.
* \(W\)+jets production: this process contributes significantly to the background even if the fake rate is as low as \(\sim 10^{-4}-10^{-5}\) because its production cross section is larger than the signal by a factor of \(\sim 10^{4}\). This process is generated using ALPGEN with matrix elements including up to five partons. The \(Wb\bar{b}\)+jets process is also generated using ALPGEN with up to three additional partons. The cross sections are scaled to the inclusive NNLO cross section by a \(K\)-factor of 1.22 [19, 33]. In the \(H+0j\) analysis and for the background studies, an inclusive \(W\) sample is generated using PYTHIA [34]. A filter requirement of at least one lepton with \(|\eta|<2.8\) is imposed at the generator level.
* \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)+jets production: In the same-flavor (\(ee\) or \(\mu\mu\)) channels the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\)+jets process may contribute significantly. The \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\tau\tau\to\ell\ell+X\) process is also a background because the process

has intrinsic \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and a dilepton invariant mass, \(m_{\ell\ell}\), that tends to be well below the \(Z\) mass. These backgrounds are modelled using ALPGEN with matrix elements including up to five partons in the final state. To improve the efficiency of the simulation, these events are generated in two dilepton invariant mass ranges separately: one with \(60<m_{\ell\ell}<200\) and another with \(10<m_{\ell\ell}<60\). In the latter invariant mass region, a filter requirement of two leptons with \(p_{\rm T}>10\), \(|\eta|<2.7\) and at least one jet with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) is imposed. Additionally, the \(Zb\bar{b}\)+jets process is also generated using ALPGEN with up to three partons in the dilepton invariant mass range \(30<m_{\ell\ell}<200\). A \(K\)-factor of 1.22 [19, 33] is applied to scale to the inclusive NNLO cross section. In the \(H+0j\) analysis and the background studies, an inclusive \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\ell\ell\) sample generated using PYTHIA is also considered. Events are required to pass a filter requiring at least one lepton with \(|\eta|<2.8\) in order to go through the detector simulation.
* \(WZ/ZZ\) production2: These processes have small cross sections compared to other backgrounds. However, they can have leptons and neutrinos from \(W\) or \(Z\) boson decays and have a similar signature as in the signal processes. They are modelled using the generator provided in MC@NLO. In this production the bosons are forced to decay into at least one charged lepton (\(e,\mu\)). In the \(H+2j\) analyses, the process \(qq\to WZ(ZZ)qq\) is relevant. These processes are modelled using ALPGEN with matrix elements including up to three partons. The \(K\)-factor of 1.21 [19, 30] is applied to scale to the inclusive NLO cross section. Footnote 2: The contributions from the quark box diagram in the \(ZZ\) process is not included in MC@NLO. It enhances the cross section by about 15% [35]. This contribution is neglected in this analysis.
* QCD multijet production: The presence of two fake leptons from this process may prove a non-negligible background due to its huge inclusive cross section. However, the large amount of CPU power required to evaluate the contamination of these fake leptons in the signal region is a non-trivial obstacle. Therefore this contribution is split into two parts. Events from \(b\bar{b}\) production are generated using PYTHIA with a tight filter requirement of two leptons with \(p_{\rm T}>10\) and \(|\eta|<2.8\) in order to study the potential impact on the analyses in the signal region. QCD multijet samples, including light quarks, are also generated using PYTHIA to estimate lepton fake rate of \(W\)+jets process in \(W\)+jets background study of Section 6.1. This sample including heavy flavor processes overlaps with the \(b\bar{b}\) sample. Therefore it is not used in the signal region because the contribution of double fake events from light jet is negligible and the contribution from heavy flavor is evaluated from enhanced samples as mentioned above.
* \(\gamma\)+jets production: this process generated by PYTHIA is used for the background study in Section 6.1. A filter requirement of at least one photon with \(p_{\rm T}>10\), \(|\eta|<2.7\) and the jet with \(p_{\rm T}>17\) is imposed.

Table 2 summarises the cross sections, filter efficiencies, and \(K\)-factors for the various background processes.

### MC Samples

All Monte Carlo events are produced with a full detector simulation based on GEANT4 [36] within the ATLAS software framework Athena [37]. The event reconstruction algorithm in this framework is the same as that used in real collision data.

The numbers of generated events are listed in Table 2. It is found that almost all processes except for QCD multijet have a number of events comparable or much larger than that expected for the target integrated luminosity of \(200\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). The \(b\bar{b}\to 2\ell+X\) sample is much smaller compared to the number of expected events due to the large cross section of this process.

Trigger Selection

A comprehensive trigger menu has been designed for the first phase of LHC data-taking with instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{31}\)\(\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\)\(\mathrm{s}^{-1}\). Within this menu, the relevant triggers to this analysis are the primary single-lepton triggers (electron and muon) with thresholds of \(p_{T}>10\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\).

The first stage in the trigger chain is the hardware-based Level 1 (L1) trigger. For events with electromagnetic (EM) clusters, a decision on whether to keep the event is made based on the measured transverse energy, \(E_{T}\), in trigger towers in a region of 0.1 \(\times\) 0.1 in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\). A measurement of particle trajectories by the L1 muon trigger is available in the barrel and the endcap regions and is described in Ref. [19].

After L1, events are passed to the High Level Trigger, which consists of the Level 2 trigger and the Event Filter. Both triggers use the \(E_{T}\) calculated with these more sophisticated methods, and the EM trigger applies additional quality criteria.

Given the low thresholds and minimal HLT selection criteria planned for the \(10^{3}1\) trigger menu for electrons and muons, the overall trigger efficiency with respect to the off-line cuts of the analyses (see Section 5) is better than 99% for the Higgs boson signal samples described in Section 2.1.

## 4 Definition of the Physics Objects

Details of the reconstruction of the physics objects with the ATLAS detector can be found in Ref. [19]. The first step in the selection of signal candidates is to identify the basic physics objects that will be used in the analysis:

* **Muons** are selected from combined tracks; these are reconstructed from the combination of a track in the Muon Spectrometer and its best-matching Inner Detector track [19]. The combined tracks are required to have \(p_{T}>15\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\) and lie within \(|\eta|<2.5\). Quality criteria are applied on the combined tracks in order to define a muon candidate. The \(\chi^{2}\) of the match between the track in the Inner Detector and the Muon Spectrometer is required to be smaller than 100. A cut on the impact parameter significance, measured with respect to the reconstructed primary vertex, is also applied; it is required to be less than 10. If any two muons are within a cone \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.3\) then the muon with lower \(p_{T}\) is ignored. Muon candidates are combined tracks that meet the quality criteria and are isolated; the \(\sum(E_{T})\) of calorimeter depositions in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.3\) is required to be less than 10\(\mathrm{GeV}\), and the related value \(\sum(E_{T})/p_{T}^{\mu}\) (where \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) is the transverse momentum of the muon candidate) is required to be less than 0.2. Similar requirements are used for the scalar \(\sum(p_{T})\) of tracks in a cone of 0.3 (excluding the track associated with the muon candidate and tracks with \(p_{T}<1\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\)); this quantity must satisfy \(\sum(p_{T})<10\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\) and the normalised isolation \(\sum(p_{T})/p_{T}^{\mu}\) should not be larger than 0.1.
* **Electrons** are selected from electromagnetic calorimeter clusters reconstructed with the standard ATLAS sliding window algorithm [19]. Electron candidates are reconstructed according to the standard ATLAS "tight" electron definition, or, in the case of the \(H+2j\) analysis, the standard ATLAS "medium" electron definition [19]. They are required to have transverse momentum greater than 15\(\mathrm{GeV}\). The absolute value of the pseudorapidity of the calorimeter cluster is required to be less than 2.47 and outside the barrel-endcap transition region 1.37\(\leq|\eta|\leq\)1.52. The impact parameter significance measured with respect to the reconstructed primary vertex is required to be less than 10. Electron candidates are required to be separated from each other and from muons by at least \(\Delta R=0.3\). If two electrons fail to satisfy this condition, then the candidate with lower transverse momentum is discarded; if an electron candidate and a muon candidate overlap, then the electron candidate is discarded. The isolation requirements for electrons are identical to those used for the muon selection.
* **Jets** are reconstructed from topological clusters using a cone algorithm with a radius \(\Delta R=0.4\), following the studies presented in Ref. [19]. They are required to have \(p_{T}>20\)  GeV and \(|\eta|<4.8\). If a high-\(p_{T}\) electron is found within \(\Delta R=0.4\) around the jet, this jet is removed. This high-\(p_{T}\) electron should pass all the requirements as mentioned in the electron selection above.
* **Missing transverse momentum** is calculated from the energy deposited in all calorimeter cells and from muons. A correction is applied for the energy lost in the cryostat. Cells belonging to hadronic jets, low \(p_{T}\) depositions and electrons get different corrections [19].
* One of the simplest **b-tagging** algorithms appropriate for the early data is used to reject events with \(b\)-jets and to construct control samples to normalise related backgrounds. The ATLAS SV0 algorithm exploits the secondary vertex information. It returns the signed distance (computed in three dimensions) between the secondary vertex candidate and the reconstructed primary vertex, divided by its error. A working point corresponding to SV0 \(b\)-tagging weight \(>5.7\) has been chosen for the analyses reported here. This working point provides \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency of 60% with rejections against light jets and \(c\)-jets of \(\approx 40\) and 6, respectively.

## 5 Event Selection

Events that pass the trigger selection described in Section 3 undergo a candidate preselection (see Section 5.1) and a final selection (see Section 5.2).

### Preselection

The Higgs boson candidate preselection includes cuts which are common for the three analyses with the different jet multiplicities. Events are separated according to lepton flavor (\(ee\), \(\mu\mu\) and \(e\mu\)). The following cuts are imposed:

* **Ia.** Exactly two opposite sign leptons passing the lepton selection are required. This cut strongly suppresses the background from \(W\)+jets events where one jet is misidentified as an electron. QCD multijet and \(b\overline{b}\)-backgrounds are also heavily suppressed by this cut. The event is vetoed if it contains a third electron pseudo-candidate which passes the standard ATLAS "medium" electron selection as well as the following criteria: track based \(p_{T}>15\)  GeV, \(\Delta R>0.05\) between the third pseudo-candidate and each of the two selected leptons, and cluster \(|\eta|<2.47\).
* **Ib.** The invariant mass of the two leptons is required to be greater than 15  GeV in order to suppress \(\Gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\) production. In the case of the same-flavor channels (\(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\)), events with \(m_{\ell\ell}\) close to the \(Z\)-boson peak (\(|m_{Z}-m_{\ell\ell}|<10\)  GeV) are excluded [19].
* **Ic.** The missing transverse momentum, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), is required to be larger than 30  GeV for the \(e\mu\) channel. The cut is raised to 40  GeV in the case of the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels. This offers a strong suppression against the \(b\overline{b}\) and \(Z\to ee/\mu\mu\) backgrounds. The left plot in Fig. 2 shows the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions after the application of cut **Ib**. After the cut on \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) the leading contributor to Drell-Yan processes arises from the decay to \(\tau\tau\).
* **Id.** The transverse mass of the dilepton plus \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) system must be larger than 30  GeV. This transverse mass is defined as \(m_{T}^{\ell\nu}=\sqrt{2P_{T}^{\ell\ell}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\cdot(1- \cos\Delta\phi)}\), where \(\Delta\phi\) is the azimuthal angle 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

Events are included in the \(H+0j\) analysis if they pass the following two cuts:

* **0ja.** Full jet veto: no jet of \(p_{T}>20\) GeV is present in the range \(|\eta|<3\). This cut suppresses top backgrounds strongly.
* **0jb.** The transverse momentum of the lepton pair is required to be \(P_{T}^{\ell\ell}>30\) GeV. This cut is intended to further suppress the Drell-Yan backgrounds.

After cut **0ja** the dominant background source is continuum \(WW\) production. In order to further enhance the signal-to-background ratio, a set of **topological cuts** is applied to all events that pass any one of the jet multiplicity selections:

* **Ta.** After having imposed in the preselection \(m_{\ell\ell}>15\) GeV, require that \(m_{\ell\ell}<50\) GeV in order to suppress several backgrounds, including continuum \(WW\) and top backgrounds. In the \(H+2j\) analysis, this cut is loosened to \(m_{\ell\ell}<80\) GeV.
* **Tb.** The azimuthal separation between signal leptons is required to be \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}<1.3\) rad; this cut exploits differences in the spin correlations between the signal and the continuum \(WW\) background.
* **Tc.** The transverse mass is required to be less than the Higgs boson mass. Here, the transverse mass is calculated as \(M_{T}=\sqrt{(E_{T}^{\ell\ell}+E_{T}^{\nu\nu})^{2}-(\mathbf{P}_{T}^{\ell\ell}+ E_{T}^{\text{miss}})^{2}}\), where the transverse energies are

The upper plots show the jet multiplicity and the dilepton invariant mass after the application of the candidate preselection (see Section 5.1) and cut **0jb**, respectively. The lower plots show the distributions of \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) and \(M_{T}\) after the application of cuts **Ta** and **Tb**, respectively.

defined as \(E_{T}^{\ell\ell}=\sqrt{(P_{T}^{\ell\ell})^{2}+m_{\ell\ell}^{2}}\), \(E_{T}^{\nu\nu}=\sqrt{(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss})^{2}+m_{\nu\nu}^{2}}\), and \(m_{\nu\nu}\) is assumed to be zero [38]. This definition is more accurate than the one used in the preselection part since now the invariant mass of the dilepton system is also taken into account. This requirement helps further suppressing continuum \(WW\) and top backgrounds, especially for lower values of the Higgs boson mass.

The plots in Fig. 3 show relevant distributions summing up the \(ee,\mu\mu\) and \(e\mu\) final states. The upper plots show the jet multiplicity and the dilepton invariant mass after the application of the Higgs boson candidate preselection (see Section 5.1) and cut **0jb**, respectively. The plot on the lower left shows the \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) distribution after the application of cut **Ta**. The background contribution with large values of \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) is suppressed with the application of a tight upper bound on \(m_{\ell\ell}\). The plot on the lower right shows the \(M_{T}\) distribution after cut **Tb**. The upper bound placed on \(M_{T}\) is particularly relevant for low Higgs boson masses.

The effective cross sections, summed over lepton flavor, are shown in Table 4. The \(W\)+jets column includes the \(W\), \(WZ\) and \(Wbb\) contributions, while the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)+jets column includes the \(Z\), \(ZZ\) and \(Zbb\) processes.

#### 5.2.2 \(H+1j\) Analysis

A significant fraction of the Higgs boson signal produced via the gluon fusion mechanism display one high \(p_{T}\) jet due to QCD radiative corrections. By requiring the presence of only one high \(p_{T}\) jet provides sizable Higgs boson signal efficiency while strongly suppressing top related backgrounds.

The \(H+1j\) analysis consists of events which pass the preselection as well as the following cuts:

* **1ja.** Require exactly one jet of \(p_{T}>20\) GeV in the range \(|\eta|<3\); denote this jet as the "tag" jet. This cut suppresses top backgrounds strongly.
* **1jb.** Application of a \(b\)-jet veto. An event is removed if the tag jet is a \(b\)-jet: \(|\eta|<\)2.5, with SV0 \(b\)-tagging weight \(>5.7\). This requirement is meant to suppress top backgrounds.
* **1jc.** Cut on the modulus of the total transverse momentum \(P_{T}^{tot}<30\) GeV. This quantity is defined as \({\bf P}_{T}^{tot}={\bf P}_{T}^{11}+{\bf P}_{T}^{\prime 2}+{\bf P}_{T}^{j}+E_{ \rm T}^{\rm miss}\), the vectorial sum of the lepton and jet transverse momenta, and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). This cut helps further suppress top backgrounds.
* **1jd.** Events which are consistent with \(Z\to\tau\tau\) decays are rejected. The visible energy fractions, \(x_{\tau}^{1}\) and \(x_{\tau}^{2}\), for the two leptons are reconstructed in the collinear approximation, and if both are positive and \(|m_{\tau\tau}-m_{Z}|<25\) GeV, the event is discarded [19].

#### 5.2.3 \(H+2j\) Analysis

The VBF mechanism can produce a Higgs boson in association with two high \(p_{T}\) and well separated jets. By requiring topological cuts on the two leading jets in the event and a veto on additional central high \(p_{T}\) jets, top backgrounds are suppressed strongly while maintaining a significant Higgs boson signal efficiency. The application of topological cuts also reduces other QCD backgrounds (especially top backgrounds) including the \(W\)+jets process. As a result, the electron identification definition is loosened with respect to that used in the \(H+0j\) and \(H+1j\) analyses.

Events that pass the preselection described in Section 5.1 need to satisfy the following cuts:

* **2ja.** At least two jets of \(p_{T}>20\)  GeV are required. The two leading jets are referred to as the "tag" jets. The event is vetoed if an additional jet of \(p_{T}>20\)  GeV is found within \(|\eta|<3\). Therefore, events in which at least one additional jet is found in the forward regions (\(3<|\eta|<4.8\)) pass this cut.

The upper plots show the SV0 \(b\)-tagging weight and \(P_{T}^{tot}\) after the application of cuts **1ja** and **1jb**, respectively. The lower plots show distributions of the dilepton invariant mass and \(M_{T}\) after the application of cuts **1jd** and **Tb**, respectively.

* **2jb.** Top backgrounds can be suppressed by the application of a \(b\)-jet veto. The event is vetoed if any jet has a SV0 \(b\)-tagging weight greater than 5.7.
* **2jc.** The two tag jets must be in opposite hemispheres, i.e. \(\eta_{j1}\cdot\eta_{j2}<0\).
* **2jd.** The \(p_{T}\) of the leading jet must be greater than 40.
* **2je.** A large separation in \(\eta\) between the tag jets is a distinctive characteristic of the VBF Higgs boson production mechanism and it is extremely effective in the rejection of almost all types of backgrounds. The pseudorapidity gap between the tag jets is required to be greater than 3.8.
* **2jf.** Jets in background processes tend to have smaller invariant mass, \(m_{jj}\), than those which accompany the signal. The invariant mass of the tag jets is required to be greater than 500.
* **2jg.** The total transverse momentum is defined as the vector sum \(\mathbf{P}_{T}^{tot}=\mathbf{P}_{T}^{l1}+\mathbf{P}_{T}^{l2}+\mathbf{P}_{T}^{ j1}+\mathbf{P}_{T}^{j2}+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). If no hard initial- and/or final-state gluons are radiated, it is expected that the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson will be balanced by the transverse momentum of the two tag jets. The total transverse momentum is required to be less than 30. This cut is applied to further suppress top backgrounds.
* **2jh.**\(Z\to\tau\tau\) rejection is applied here in the same way as described for the \(H+1j\) analysis in Section 5.2.2.

After these cuts the topological selection described in Section 5.2.1 is applied. The upper plots in Fig. 5 show the SV0 \(b\)-tagging weight and the pseudorapidity gap between tag jets after the application of cuts **2ja** and **2jd**, respectively. The lower plots display the distributions of \(m_{jj}\) and \(P_{T}^{tot}\) after the application of cuts **2je** and **2jf**, respectively.

## 6 Background Estimation

To reduce the dependence on Monte Carlo during the early stages of data taking, several methods for background estimation using input from data have been developed and used in the present analysis. These so called data driven methods are described in this section along with the systematic uncertainties

assigned to them. The majority of the data-driven methods try to identify a control region which is dominated by a single background and use the measurement in the control region in data to normalise the expected contribution in the signal region from this background source. Sections 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 describe the methods used for the extraction of the \(W\)+jets, \(t\overline{t}\) and continuum \(WW\) backgrounds, respectively. The summary of the systematic uncertainties used in the exclusion potential calculation is given in Section 7.

### Data Driven \(W\)+jets Background Estimation

This section introduces two data driven background estimation methods for \(W\)+jets and evaluates the expected systematic uncertainties for each approach. Section 6.1.1 explores an event selection where the lepton selection cuts are loosened in order to provide a control region enriched in \(W\)+jets. This method is referred to as the "Loose Lepton" (LL) method. Section 6.1.2 describes the "Subtraction" method for estimating the \(W\)+jets background normalisation. This method exploits the fact that the contribution from \(W\)+jets depends strongly on lepton identification variables. The Subtraction method is presented here as a cross-check to the Loose Lepton method.

#### 6.1.1 Method 1 (Loose Lepton Method)

The most direct approach to estimate the \(W\)+jets background is to define a control region with a lepton which satisfies a set of loosened selection cuts. Table 7 shows a loosened set of electron and muon

where \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{one\;id\;+\;one\;fake}}^{\mathrm{\ell\;\mathrm{ch}}}\) is the estimated number of \(W\)+jets events contributing to the signal region, and \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{one\;id\;\ell\;+\;one\;fake}}\) is the number of \(W\)+jets events with one identified lepton and one fakeable lepton. This method assumes that the kinematics of the fakeable lepton candidate is similar to the kinematics of fake leptons which pass all the cuts necessary to be classified as identified leptons. Once an event with a fakeable lepton is reweighted by \(\mathrm{f}_{\ell}\), both lepton candidates are treated as though they were identified leptons for the purposes of kinematic cuts.

The key ingredient in this method is the measurement of \(\mathrm{f}_{\ell}\) with a control sample. The first attempt is performed with a dijet-enriched sample. The dominant source of systematic error is the uncertainty in the estimation of the fake rate, and the total uncertainty includes contributions from several sources. First, the dijet sample which is used to estimate the fake rate is contaminated by real leptons from the decays of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons; the fake rate estimate obtained this way may therefore be biased. It is possible to reduce the contamination by vetoing events if a \(Z\) candidate is present (\(76<m_{\ell\ell}<106\) GeV) or if a \(W\) candidate with \(M_{T}>30\) GeV is reconstructed.3) After these cuts are applied, the contamination from real leptons in the dijet sample is not large. The bias in the fake rate is 8.5% for electrons and 5.0% for muons; these numbers are taken to be an uncertainty in the fake rate.

Footnote 3: The transverse mass is defined here as \(M_{T}=\sqrt{2P_{T}^{\ell}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\cdot(1-\cos\Delta\phi)}\), where \(\Delta\phi\) is the azimuthal angle between the lepton and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), and \(P_{T}^{\ell}\) is the transverse momentum of the lepton.

Another source of systematic uncertainty is the statistical error in the number of events in the dijet sample in data and Monte Carlo. With an integrated luminosity of \(200\) pb\({}^{-1}\), the former is not negligible; using a jet trigger with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV threshold (a prescale factor of 42000 in the trigger menu is foreseen for LHC running with an instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{31}\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)), the statistical error is 17% for electrons and 15% for muons. However, the statistical uncertainty due to the limited number of events in the presently available dijet Monte Carlo sample is larger; it is 32% for electrons and 28% for muons. Figure 6 shows the estimated fake rate as a function of lepton \(p_{T}\) with the stat

Additionally, the MC statistics uncertainty is shown in black dotted line.

finite size of the dijet sample expected in data with an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\). No significant differences were found between the results obtained with the dijet and \(W\)+jets samples.

Finally, it is conceivable that the fake rate f\({}_{\ell}\) estimated from the dijet sample will not be exactly the same as the fake rate in \(W\)+jets events. This possible sample dependence is taken into account as an uncertainty. The fractional difference in the observed fake rate in dijet Monte Carlo and \(W\)+jets Monte Carlo, \((\mathrm{f}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{dijet}}-\mathrm{f}_{\ell}^{W\mathrm{+jets}})/ \mathrm{f}_{\ell}^{\mathrm{dijet}}\), is found to be 12% for electrons and 26% for muons; these values are taken as a systematic error on f\({}_{\ell}\). Table 8 shows a summary of all the systematic errors in the fake rate estimate.

In order to define the control sample all kinematic selections described in Section 5 are applied except that one lepton is loosened to comply with the definition of fakeable object. In a second step the fake rate is applied. Table 9 shows a demonstration of the method. This method is applied for the \(H+0j\) and \(H+1j\) analyses but not for the \(H+2j\) analysis; the \(W\)+jets contribution is much smaller in the latter case. The estimated normalisation for Opposite-Sign dilepton events (OS) which is signal region observed in Monte Carlo agrees with the estimate obtained using the Loose Lepton method. The Table also shows a cross-check that can be performed in data: use the Loose Lepton method to estimate the number of Same-Sign (SS) dilepton events in a region with similar kinematic cuts as the signal, and then measure this normalisation in data to see if the estimate is correct. Although the expected number of \(W\)+jets events in same-sign events is as small as it is in Opposite-Sign dilepton events, the contamination from processes like the Higgs boson signal, continuum \(WW\), and \(t\overline{t}\) production is much smaller. The Table shows that the Monte Carlo prediction and the expected estimate from the Loose Lepton method in the same-sign control sample agree.

A second control sample to estimate \(\mathrm{f}_{\ell}\) is the \(\gamma\)+jets process instead of dijets. Clean samples of \(\gamma\)+jets events can be selected using a tight photon identification, suppressing the dijet background. The kinematics and jet composition in the \(\gamma\)+jets sample are closer to those of the \(W\)+jets events than dijets. Using a tight photon selection about 450 events passing the electron identification cuts are expected with an integrated luminosity of \(200\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). Monte Carlo studies haven shown that \(\mathrm{f}_{\ell}\) obtained from a sample of \(\gamma\)+jets events is within 10% of that of \(W\)+jets events.

#### 6.1.2 Method 2 (Subtraction Method)

The second method considered here as a way to estimate the \(W\)+jets background is referred to as the Subtraction method. It is a general method which is applicable in cases where a background of interest is more sensitive to a cut on some variable than other irreducible backgrounds and the efficiency of the cut on the irreducible backgrounds is known.

In the case of the \(H(\to WW^{(*)}\to e\nu\mu\nu)+0j\) channel the method exploits the fact that the \(W\)+jets background is more sensitive to an electron identification cut than backgrounds such as \(t\overline{t}\) and \(WW\), which contain two real leptons from \(W\) decays in the final state. Figure 7 shows the number of expected events for an integrated luminosity of \(200\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) divided by the electron identification efficiency for different processes after cut **0ja** (see Section 5.2.1) for the \(H(\to WW^{(*)}\to e\nu\mu\nu)+0j\) channel except for the requirement on the electron identification. The quantity shown in Fig. 7 is evaluated for different lepton identification criteria. For processes with real electrons, this curve is, by definition, flat as a function of the electron efficiency, provided the efficiency estimate is accurate. However, the same ratio for reducible backgrounds becomes small when the identification cut is tight, as can be seen from the blue curve with square markers in Fig. 7.

Figure 7: Measurement of the irreducible background and \(W\)+jets with the Subtraction method. Results are shown for the \(H(\to WW^{(*)}\to e\nu\mu\nu)+0j\) channel after the application of cut **0ja** (see Section 5.2.1) in terms of the number of expected events, Nevents, divided by the electron identification, ID, efficiency as a function of the electron identification efficiency. The hollow red circles, solid blue squares and upside-down black triangles correspond to the total expected data, \(W(\to\mu)\)+jets and the sum of the continuum \(WW\) and top backgrounds, respectively. The green triangles show the estimated \(W(\to\mu\nu)\)+jets background. A solid curve that goes through the total expected data corresponds to a fit (see text). This fit takes into account the correlations between points. Results are shown for an integrated luminosity of \(200\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\).

The actual estimate of the \(W\)+jets background is obtained by fitting the observed curve in data to the function \(y=p_{0}+p_{1}/(1-x)^{2}\). The fit to the expected data is shown in Fig. 7. This procedure takes into account the correlations between the points of the expected data. The constant term is interpreted as the contribution from the backgrounds with real electrons.

The shapes of the discriminating variables \(m_{T}^{\ell\ell\nu}\) and \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) for \(W\)+jets at the working point can also be obtained using a loose electron identification cut since the contribution from \(W\)+jets is dominant in this region, as shown in Fig. 8.

For the case of the \(H(\to WW^{(*)}\to\mu\nu\mu\nu)\) channels the Subtraction method is also feasible. In the channel \(H(\to WW^{(*)}\to e\nu e\nu)\) channels, one of the electrons is fixed with "tight" identification cut, the other one is scanned with different identification criteria, as the case of \(H(\to WW^{(*)}\to e\nu\mu\nu)\) channels. The comparison between the Loose Lepton and Subtraction methods for the \(H+0j\) and \(H+1j\) analyses is shown in Table 10.

### Estimation of Top Backgrounds

The methods used to normalise the top background are discussed separately for the \(H+0j\), \(H+1j\), and \(H+2j\) analyses, since the three channels have different top background contributions, different dependences on systematics, and different handles available to control the top background normalisation.

In previous studies, the top background in the \(H+0j\) channel was normalised using a control sample where the \(b\)-veto cut that was applied in the signal region was reversed [19]. However, this approach is not appropriate for the early data, since the event rate in such a control sample is small and it relies on good \(b\)-tagging performance for low-\(p_{T}\) jets. Instead, a control sample is used based on \(t\overline{t}\) events where one top decays leptonically and the other decays hadronically, as described in Section 6.2.1.

In the case of the \(H+1j\) and \(H+2j\) analyses, there are high-\(p_{T}\) jets available which can be used to define a \(b\)-tagged control sample; however, in the case of the \(H+2j\) analysis it is useful to loosen the kinematic cuts in order to improve the statistics in the control region. These control samples are discussed in Sections 6.2.2 and 6.2.3, respectively.

#### 6.2.1 Estimation of Top Backgrounds in the \(H+0j\) Analysis

This method is based on a "top box" control region using semi-leptonic decays of \(t\overline{t}\); similar methods were studied in the context of SUSY searches in Ref. [19]. Events are selected by requiring the presence of one lepton with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV if it is an electron or \(p_{T}>20\) GeV if it is a muon, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>60\) GeV, and at least four jets. At least one of the jets is required to be \(b\)-tagged. Both \(W\)s are reconstructed in order obtain two top quark candidates. Both top quark candidates are required to have masses larger than \(150\) GeV. One can approximate the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the leading jet in the two-lepton final state (and hence the jet veto efficiency) by studying the leading jet remaining in events in the top box control region after excluding the two jets comprising the hadronically decaying \(W\) candidate and the \(b\)-tagged jet (since its \(p_{T}\) distribution is biased by the \(p_{T}\) dependence of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency). The plot in Fig. 9 shows a comparison between the jet veto efficiency in the signal region after the application of cut **Id** (blue squares) and the estimated jet veto efficiency using the \(b\)-tagged top box control region (red triangles). The difference in the jet veto efficiency seen in Fig. 9 can be further reduced by lowering the \(p_{T}\) threshold of the \(b\)-jet veto to \(15\) GeV. It was verified that the jet veto efficiency does not change significantly after the application of cuts presented in Section 5.2.1.

The top box control region method only estimates the contribution from \(t\overline{t}\); it does not include the contribution from single top or nonresonant \(WWbb\) production. Treating this contribution conservatively as a theoretical uncertainty leads to a systematic error of \(\sim 40\%\) for the case of a jet veto \(p_{T}\) threshold of \(20\) GeV. In addition, a check on the effect of a shifted jet energy scale indicated that the jet energy scale could lead to an uncertainty as large as \(66\%\) for the same \(p_{T}\) threshold, although it is worth mentioning that statistical errors due to the finite size of the Monte Carlo sample may be contributing to this number. The systematics of this method is further discussed in Section 7.

#### 6.2.2 Estimation of Top Backgrounds in the \(H+1j\) Analysis

The control sample used to normalise the top background in the \(H+1j\) analysis has exactly the same cuts as the signal region for that channel, except that the transverse mass cut is removed and the \(b\)-veto cut is reversed; the "tag" jet is required to have an ATLAS SV0 \(b\)-tagging weight \(>\)5.7 (see Section 4). Therefore, the control sample has two jets in the final state. The control sample is contaminated by events other than top at the level of only a few percent, and a total of roughly 20 events are expected for an integrated luminosity of \(200\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

To obtain an estimate of the top cross section in the signal region given data, one counts the number of observed events in this region and then multiplies by a scale factor, \(\alpha_{top}\), which is related to the \(b\)-taggingefficiency; it is desirable to obtain this scale factor from data.

#### 6.2.3 Estimation of Top Backgrounds in the \(H+2j\) Analysis

One of the most effective cuts against the top background in the \(H+2j\) analysis is the pseudorapidity gap between the tag jets (see Fig. 5). Another tool that helps suppressing top production is a \(b\)-jet veto. Therefore, it is possible to construct a control region enriched in top by reversing this requirement with respect to the signal region. Signal is excluded from this control region by reversing the cut on the invariant mass of the leptons: \(m_{\ell\ell}>80\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). In order to have enough statistics in the control region, the \(m_{jj}\) cut has also been reversed (see Section 5.2.3). Table 11 shows the expected cross sections in the control region. One can clearly see that this control region is a pure top region and can be used to normalise the top backgrounds from data.

The systematics of the method are reported in Section 7. It is possible to further reduce these systematic uncertainties by applying as many similar cuts as possible in the control region and the signal

region. For instance, the uncertainty would be considerably smaller if the \(m_{jj}\) cut were not reversed; as the integrated luminosity increases it will become more advantageous to switch to such a control region.

### Continuum \(Ww\) Background Estimation

The contributions from the continuum \(WW\) background 4 in the \(H+0j\) and \(H+1j\) analyses are normalised using a control region defined by applying all the cuts described in Section 5 except for reversing the \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) selection and requiring \(m_{\ell\ell}>50\). For the like-flavor channels (\(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\)) an extra \(Z\) veto selection is applied (see Section 5.1). This control region is referred to as "the reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\)" control region and its main purpose is to estimate the number of \(WW\) events in the signal region. Overall the contribution from \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) production is small in the control region and it is neglected.

Footnote 4: From now on in this section we refer to this background simply as \(WW\).

The number of \(WW\) events in the signal region is found by multiplying the number of \(WW\) events in the reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) region in data with the ratio of the number of events in the signal region to the number of events in the reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) region for \(WW\) events taken from Monte Carlo. This scale factor is labelled \(\alpha_{WW}\):

\[\alpha_{WW}=\frac{N_{WW}^{S.R.}(\mathrm{MC})}{N_{WW}^{C.R.}(\mathrm{MC})}, \tag{5}\]

where, \(N_{WW}^{S.R.}(\mathrm{MC})\) and \(N_{WW}^{C.R.}(\mathrm{MC})\) stand for the expected number of \(WW\) events in the signal region and the reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) in MC, respectively. Besides the uncertainty on \(\alpha_{WW}\) coming from limited MC statistics, several additional systematic uncertainties are estimated (see Section 7).

The reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) control sample is dominated by \(WW\) events, but there are also significant contributions from the other background processes like \(t\bar{t}\) production and \(W\)+jets. To find the number of \(WW\) events in the control region, these additional background sources are subtracted from the total number of events in the reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) control region. The estimates for the additional backgrounds are found by multiplying the number of events in the control regions for \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W\)+jets with the scale factors for going from these control regions to the reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) region obtained in MC. These scale factors are labelled \(\beta_{top}\) and \(\beta_{W+jets}\).

Given the measured number of events in the reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) control region, \(N_{\Delta\phi}^{C.R.}\), the number of events measured in the \(b\)-tagged control region (see Section 6.2), \(N_{top}^{C.R.}\), and the number of events in the Loose Lepton control region (see Section 6.1), \(N_{W+jets}^{C.R.}\), it is possible to estimate the number of background \(WW\) events in the signal region, \(N_{WW}^{S.R.}\):

\[N_{WW}^{S.R.}=N_{WW}^{C.R.}\cdot\alpha_{WW} \tag{6}\]

where the number of \(WW\) events estimated in the reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) control region, \(N_{WW}^{C.R.}\), is obtained from:

\[N_{WW}^{C.R.}=N_{\Delta\phi}^{C.R.}-\beta_{top}\cdot N_{top}^{C.R.}-\beta_{W+jets }\cdot N_{W+jets}^{C.R.} \tag{7}\]

i.e. the total number of events in the reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) control region minus the expected contamination of \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W\)+jets events in this region. The central values of the cross sections and the scale factors are given in Tables 12 and 13 (see Section 7).

The contribution from the \(WW\) background can also be extracted by means of a MC prediction. This prediction could have significant systematics due to the uncertainty in the luminosity measurement. This error would cancel out in a \(WW\) prediction normalised to the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) production [35]. The latter sample also provides information about the jet veto survival probability of the \(WW\) process [35].

#### 6.3.1 Estimation of \(Ww\)+jets in the \(H+2j\) Analysis

For the \(H+2j\) analysis the \(t\bar{t}\) contamination starts to dominate the reversed \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) control region while the \(W\)+jets contamination is negligible. To increase the purity of the control region, a \(b\)-vetoed top control region similar to the top background control region described in subsection 6.2.3 is used to normalise the \(WW\) background. The \(b\)-vetoed control region is defined by the same kinematic cuts as in the top control region, but with the \(b\)-tagging cut reversed (\(b\)-veto). There is still a significant contamination from the top background in the \(b\)-vetoed control sample, therefore it is important to subtract that contamination. The top control sample defined in subsection 6.2.3 is a natural choice for this purpose; the scale factor \(\beta_{top}\), the ratio of the top cross sections between the \(WW\) control region and the top control region, can be derived from Monte Carlo or estimated from data. Given the number of events in the \(b\)-vetoed control region in data, \(N_{b-veto}^{C.R.}\), the number of background \(WW\) events in the signal region is found from:

\[N_{WW}^{S.R.}=\left(N_{b-veto}^{C.R.}-\beta_{top}\cdot N_{top}^{C.R.}\right) \cdot\alpha_{WW} \tag{8}\]

The numerical values for \(\alpha_{WW}\) and \(\beta_{top}\) together with their systematic uncertainties are discussed further in Section 7.

## 7 Systematic Uncertainties of Background Estimation

In order to determine background normalisations in the signal regions scale factors are needed. As discussed in previous Sections, these scale factors can also be extracted from data. For the computation of the exclusion potential (see Section 8) the scale factors predicted by Monte Carlo are used.

The final result for each of the analyses depends on four event counts measured in data and a set of Monte Carlo scale factors with their corresponding uncertainties. The four input values from data are:

* The number of events in the signal region, \(N^{S.R.}\).
* The number of events in the \(W\)+jets control region, \(N_{W+jets}^{C.R.}\).
* The number of events in the top background control region, \(N_{top}^{C.R.}\).
* The number of events in the \(WW\)+jets control region, \(N_{WW}^{C.R.}\).

To get the estimated number of background events in the signal region, there are three main scale factors - corresponding to the ratio of the number of events in the signal region to the number of events in the control region - and their corresponding uncertainties:

* The \(W\)+jets scale factor, \(\alpha_{W+jets}\).
* The top background scale factor, \(\alpha_{top}\).
* The \(WW\) scale factor, \(\alpha_{WW}\).

Furthermore, there are two secondary scale factors used to subtract off the contamination of top backgrounds and \(W\)+jets in the \(WW\) control region:

* The scale factor for \(W\)+jets, \(\beta_{W+jets}\).
* The scale factor for the top backgrounds, \(\beta_{top}\).

Figure 10 summarises the flow chart of the extraction of the main backgrounds. Shown are the four data samples and how the five scale factors are applied to get the background estimates in a graphical form. The top control region and the \(W\)+jets control regions are considered to be pure samples of top and \(W\)+jets respectively. The normalisation for the \(WW\) background is taken from the \(WW\) control region after subtracting the contaminations from top and \(W\)+jets in the \(WW\) control region. To get the numbers of top and \(W\)+jets events in the signal region and in the \(WW\) control region there are four scale factors, \(\alpha_{top}\) and \(\alpha_{W+jets}\) to get the number of events in the signal region and \(\beta_{top}\) and \(\beta_{W+jets}\) to get the number of events in the \(WW\) control region. Finally there is a fifth scale factor, \(\alpha_{WW}\)  to get the number of \(WW\) background events in the signal region from the number of background subtracted events in the \(WW\) control region.

Table 12 shows the number of \(WW\), top backgrounds and \(W\)+jets events in each of the four regions. Other smaller backgrounds are ignored for the purpose of estimating the scale factors. The assumption that the three control regions are dominated by these three sources of backgrounds is true to a level of 97% or higher. No uncertainty is assigned due to ignoring additional small backgrounds.

The central values for the five scale factors are obtained from ratios of the event counts in Table 12, and are shown in Table 13. Table 14 shows the impact of systematic uncertainties on these scale factors for the \(H+0j\), \(H+1j\) and \(H+2j\) analyses, respectively. The following is a list of the systematic uncertainties considered in the analyses together with a short description of how they are estimated:

* \(WW\) **and Top Monte Carlo \(Q^{2}\) Scale:** The uncertainty from higher order effects on the scale factors for \(WW\) and top quark backgrounds is estimated from varying the \(Q^{2}\) scale of the \(WW\) and \(t\bar{t}\) Monte Carlo samples. Several \(WW\) and \(t\bar{t}\) Monte Carlo samples have been generated with different \(Q^{2}\) scales. Both renormalisation and factorisation scales are multiplied by factors of 8 and 1/8 (4 and 1/4) for the \(WW\) (\(t\bar{t}\)) process. The uncertainties on the relevant scale factors (\(\alpha_{WW}\), \(\alpha_{top}\) and \(\beta_{top}\)) are taken to be the maximum deviation from the central value for these scale factors and the values for these scale factors in any of the \(Q^{2}\) scale altered samples [19].
* **Jet Energy Scale and Jet Energy Resolution:** The Jet Energy Scale (JES) uncertainty is taken to be 7% for jets with \(|\eta|<3.2\) and 15% for jets with \(|\eta|>3.2\). To estimate the effect of the

JES uncertainty on the scale factors, the energy of the jets in the events are coherently scaled up or down according to the JES uncertainty and the shift in jet energy is propagated to the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). The scale factors are re-calculated using the JES shifted events, and the difference between the central value for the scale factor and the re-calculated value for the scale factor for the JES shifted events is taken to be the systematic uncertainty. To make the systematic uncertainty symmetric, the maximum value of the uncertainty from the positive JES shift and the uncertainty from the negative JES shift is finally taken to be the systematic uncertainty. To estimate the effect of the Jet Energy Resolution (JER), the jet energies in the events are smeared according to a Gaussian with mean 0 and width \(0.45\sqrt{E}\) for jets with \(|\eta|<3.2\) and width \(0.63\sqrt{E}\) for jets with \(|\eta|>3.2\). The scale factors are re-calculated using the smeared events, and the difference between the central values for the scale factors and the values obtained with the smeared events are taken to be the uncertainty on the scale factors due to JER. In Table 14 the uncertainties from JES and JER are combined into one systematic uncertainty, this uncertainty is completely dominated by the contribution from the JES.
* \(b\)**-tagging efficiency:** The uncertainty on the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is taken to be 10%, while no uncertainty on the mis-tagging rate is considered. A shift in the \(b\)-tagging efficiency affects the scale factors concerning top quark backgrounds while it has no effect on the scale factors for \(WW\) and \(W\)+jets.
* **Monte Carlo Statistics:** The final systematic uncertainty considered is coming from the limited number of Monte Carlo events in the signal region and in each of the control regions. This uncertainty can be large if the number of events selected is small, this is the case for \(W\)+jets in the signal region for example leading to large uncertainties on \(\alpha_{W+jets}\) from Monte Carlo statistics.

The impact of other sources of systematics, such as the lepton identification uncertainty, is small and it is neglected in the present analysis. The impact on the exclusion potential of the uncertainty in the

The numbers for the top control region in the \(H+0j\) analysis are from the top box control region described in Section 6.2.1; the numbers under \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) correspond to the \(e\) and \(\mu\) channels, respectively. The \(W\)+jets background is too small to be measured in the \(H+2j\) analysis, therefore the \(W\)+jets control region is not used for the \(H+2j\) analysis.

luminosity measurement is discussed in Section 8. A check of the impact of multiple additional soft proton-proton interaction was evaluated using a scenario of instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and \(450\) ns bunch-crossing. This scenario corresponds to an average of four additional soft proton-proton interactions. The impact on the efficiency of Higgs boson signal and top backgrounds is driven by the appearance of extra hadronic activity. A decrease of \(\approx 20\%,5\%\) and \(20\%\) for signal, and \(\approx 25\%,30\%\) and \(0\%\) for top backgrounds is observed in the efficiency of these processes in the \(H+0j\), \(H+1j\) and \(H+2j\) analyses, respectively. The impact of additional soft proton-proton collisions can be alleviated by the use of track-based jets, as demonstrated in Ref. [19].

## 8 Exclusion Potential

Limits on the Higgs boson production cross section and the expected significance are calculated using the usual Likelihood Ratio formalism, recently summarised in Ref. [19]. Since the present analysis is a number counting analysis with control samples to measure each of several background contributions, the Likelihood function is based on a product of Poisson terms for the signal region and each of the control regions.5 The Likelihood function is maximised on the space of a set of free parameters which include normalisations for each of the main backgrounds and nuisance parameters corresponding to the various uncertainties; more details are given below. Several maximisations are performed independently; one with the signal normalisation free to float, and the rest with the signal normalisation fixed to each of a set of values ranging from zero to 10 times the Standard Model prediction. The Likelihood Ratio \(\lambda\) for a given signal normalisation hypothesis is the ratio of the maximum Likelihood with the signal normalisation free to the maximum Likelihood with the signal normalisation fixed to the specified value. The upper limit is the largest value of the signal normalisation hypothesis for which the log Likelihood Ratio is smaller than 1.36 (or, equivalently, \(\sqrt{2\ln\lambda}<1.65\)). This value is chosen to give a 95% confidence level one-sided upper bound; i.e., the expected false exclusion rate is about 5%.

Footnote 5: In the significance calculations presented here, the \(b\overline{b}\) background and its associated control sample is ignored.

As discussed in Section 7, the ratios of background cross sections in the signal region and the various control regions are not always exactly predicted by the Monte Carlo; the Likelihood function therefore

includes nuisance parameters corresponding to these ratios as well as Gaussian constraints to force the nuisance parameters to be close to their predicted values. The background normalisations in different jet multiplicity analyses, as well as the associated systematic errors, are assumed to be completely uncorrelated. Thus, for example, there is no unified top background normalisation parameter that affects the top background in all jet multiplicity analyses; each analysis has its own. The systematic error on the signal is separated into two categories. The contributions to the error from uncertainties that primarily affect jet multiplicity and \(p_{T}\) spectra (jet energy scale and theoretical uncertainties) are taken to be uncorrelated in each analysis of jet multiplicity. In the \(H+0j\) analysis, the jet energy scale uncertainty is estimated to be 6% and the theory uncertainty is estimated to be 4.5%; in the \(H+1j\) analysis, the corresponding numbers are 6.3% and 2%. These sources of systematic errors are ignored in the case of the \(H+2j\) analysis. On the other hand, the contribution to the systematic error on the signal efficiency arising from the lepton reconstruction efficiency is taken to be exactly correlated in all analyses, since it is clear that this is the appropriate treatment for the uncertainty in the lepton reconstruction efficiency. The lepton reconstruction efficiency uncertainty is taken to be 1% per lepton; the reconstruction efficiency uncertainty for electrons is taken to be uncorrelated to the reconstruction efficiency for muons. The lepton reconstruction efficiency uncertainty is ignored for the backgrounds, since it is a small effect which will largely cancel out thanks to the use of control samples.

Because of the heavy use of control samples, the uncertainty in the determination of the integrated luminosity does not enter the background uncertainty, apart from a few places where minor backgrounds are not normalised using control samples; the luminosity uncertainty on these backgrounds is ignored. However, it does affect the expected number of signal events after cuts. This source of uncertainty can be taken into account in the Likelihood function in the same way as the signal efficiency uncertainties

described above by writing the expected number of signal events for a given jet multiplicity as

\[n_{s}^{exp}=\mu\times\mathcal{L}\times\sigma\times BR\times\epsilon\times(1- \delta_{\epsilon})^{n_{e}}\times(1-\delta_{\mu})^{n_{\mu}}\times(1-\delta_{jets}) \times(1-\delta_{\mathcal{L}}) \tag{9}\]

where \(\mu\) is the free parameter for the global signal normalisation (\(\mu\)=1 corresponds the Standard Model), \(\mathcal{L}\) is the integrated luminosity, \(\sigma\times BR\) is the predicted cross section times branching ratio, \(\epsilon\) is the signal efficiency, \(\delta_{\epsilon}\) (\(\delta_{\mu}\)) is the nuisance parameter for the electron (muon) efficiency, \(n_{e}\) (\(n_{\mu}\)) is the number of electrons (muons) in the given signal region or control region, \(\delta_{jets}\) is the nuisance parameter for the jet-related uncertainty discussed above, and \(\delta_{\mathcal{L}}\) is the nuisance parameter for the luminosity uncertainty. In the full Likelihood function combining all analyses, all these constants and parameters are shared across all analyses except \(\epsilon\) and \(\delta_{jets}\). Each of the \(\delta\) parameters is constrained to be close to zero by multiplying the Likelihood function by Gaussian terms (one for each \(\delta\) parameter) centred at zero with a width given by the expected uncertainty. For the luminosity uncertainty, a width of 10% is used; the values of the other systematic errors on the signal are discussed above.

The normalisations for the various signal and background contributions in the same-flavor channels are taken to be the corresponding values in the opposite-flavor channel times a ratio of cross sections taken from Monte Carlo. In other words, the contributions from the \(ee\), \(\mu\mu\) and \(e\mu\) channels are treated as being exactly correlated; this simply reflects the expectation that the lepton reconstruction efficiencies will be well-known.

Putting all the pieces together, the full formula for the Likelihood is given by

where \(G(X|a,b)\) is a Gaussian function of \(X\) centred at \(a\) with width \(b\), \(P(N|n)\) is the Poisson probability to observe \(N\) events given \(n\) expected, \(N_{SR}^{j}\) is the number of events observed in the signal region for jet multiplicity \(j\), \(N_{WWCR}^{j}\) is the corresponding number of events observed in the large-\(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) control region, \(N_{TB}^{j}\) is the number of events observed in the top control region for that jet multiplicity,6) \(N_{LL}^{j}\) is the number of events observed in the corresponding Loose Lepton control region, a superscript of _exp_ on the extrapolation constants indicates the expected value of that parameter, \(n_{s}^{j}(SR)\) is the expected number of signal events in the control region for jet multiplicity \(j\) (which depends on the scale factor \(\mu\) and other quantities as discussed above), \(n_{s}^{j}(CR)\) is the corresponding number for the \(WW\) control region, the other parameters like \(n_{t\overline{t}}^{j}(TB)\) indicate the fitted number of events for the background indicated in the subscript in the control region indicated by the superscript, \({\cal L}\) denotes the integrated luminosity, and \(\sigma_{DY}^{j}(SR)\) (\(\sigma_{DY}^{j}(CR)\)) is the predicted cross section for the Drell-Yan process in the signal region (main \(WW\) control region). Note that the Poisson term \(L_{Pois}^{j,e\mu}\) above only indicates the \(e\mu\) channel; as mentioned above, the corresponding expressions for the same-flavor channels, \(L_{Pois}^{j,ee}\) and \(L_{Pois}^{j,\mu\mu}\), are similar except that the values of the expected backgrounds in the various regions are given by the corresponding value in the \(e\mu\) channel times a ratio of cross sections.7)

Footnote 6: The top box control region for \(H+0j\), the \(b\)-tagged control region for \(H+1j\), and the \(b\)-tagged small-\(\Delta\eta_{jj}\) region for the \(H+2j\) analysis.

Footnote 7: For example, \(\alpha_{WW}^{j}n_{WW}^{j}(CR)\) in the Poisson term for the signal region above would be replaced by \(\alpha_{WW}^{j}n_{WW}^{j}(CR)\times(\sigma_{WW}^{j}(SR,ee)/\sigma_{WW}^{j}(SR, e\mu))\) for the case of the \(ee\) channel.

Only one signal normalisation parameter, \(\mu\), is used for all three analyses (\(H+0j\), \(H+1j\), and \(H+2j\)); it is defined such that \(\mu=1\) corresponds to the Standard Model prediction for the cross section. Since this is the only free parameter describing the signal, one expects the Likelihood Ratio to be distributed as a \(\chi^{2}\) with one degree of freedom in an ensemble of toy Monte Carlo outcomes where the true signal normalisation coincides with the value of the normalisation being tested. Toy Monte Carlo studies show that this is indeed the case; Figure 11 shows the Likelihood Ratio in background-only and signal-plus-background outcomes for two different values of \(\mu\). (Left: \(\mu=0\); right: \(\mu=1\).)

For an upper limit, it is important to check that the probability to incorrectly exclude the signal when it is present is not in conflict with the quoted confidence level. Figure 12 shows the results of a toy Monte Carlo study demonstrating that this condition is satisfied. The left plot shows the distribution of the obtained upper limit on the signal cross section for a representative mass of \(m_{H}=170\) GeV and an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\). The red curve shows the distribution for background-only outcomes and the black curve shows the result for outcomes that contain signal as well as background. In the example, the fraction of the black distribution below \(\mu=1\) is about 5.1%; the plot on the right in Figure 12 shows the value of this fraction as a function of \(m_{H}\). As one would expect for a statement at the 95% confidence level, this fraction is not much more than 5% anywhere.

Tables 15 and 16 display the expected 95% confidence level limit on the signal normalization in units of the Standard Model prediction for an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\). Table 15 shows the results

for a Higgs boson mass of \(m_{H}=170\)  for the \(H+0j\), \(H+1j\) and the \(H+2j\) analyses separately. The errors due to the statistics of the Monte Carlo samples are reported for the expected number of background events. Results in Table 16 are shown for three analyses combined as a function of the Higgs boson mass. Figure 13 shows the expected 95% confidence level limit on the signal normalization as a function of the Higgs boson mass. The green and yellow bands show the expected \(\pm 1\sigma\) and \(\pm 2\sigma\) fluctuations, respectively. The expected value at \(m_{H}=170\)  corresponds to the median of the dashed curve in the left plot in Figure 12; the green and yellow bands are computed similarly. The sensitivity of the individual analyses is also shown in Fig. 13. Figure 14 shows the expected 95% confidence level limit on the signal normalization in units of the Standard Model prediction.

The impact of systematics on the \(H+0j\) and \(H+2j\) analyses is moderate for a Higgs boson mass around \(m_{H}=170\). Doubling the size of the systematic uncertainties would degrade the limit by \(\approx 40\%\) and by \(\approx 5\%\) for the \(H+0j\) and \(H+2j\) analyses, respectively. The situation is different in the \(H+1j\) analysis, where the limit can degrade by a factor of two. This is due to the poorer signal-to-background ratio achieved in this analysis.

## 9 Conclusions

The prospects for Higgs boson searches using the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) decay mode at ATLAS have been presented. This includes the implementation of realistic detector effects and a discussion of methods to estimate the main backgrounds. A detailed systematic error analysis has been presented. Events are separated into three sets of analyses according to the hadronic jet multiplicity. The sensitivity of the ATLAS detector is computed for 10  proton-proton centre-of-mass energy and an integrated luminosity of \(200\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). With these conditions a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass in the range \(160-170\)  can be excluded with a 95% confidence level. The use of more advanced techniques, e.g. multivariate techniques will allow to extend this exclusion range.

Figure 12: Left: the sampling distributions of the obtained upper bound on the signal normalisation for a representative Higgs boson mass of 170  and an integrated luminosity of 200  for background-only outcomes (red) and for signal-plus-background outcomes (black). Right: the probability to incorrectly exclude a Standard Model Higgs boson when it is actually present in the data as a function of the Higgs boson mass.
