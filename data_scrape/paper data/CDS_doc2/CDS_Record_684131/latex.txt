Introduction

A presampler located on the front face of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter [1] is required to achieve sufficient energy resolution of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter system. The presampler is made up of 64 sectors each covering half the length of the barrel calorimeter and 11.25\({}^{0}\) in azimuth. The sectors consist of 8 different modules, approximately 1.5 cm thick, 28 cm wide and with a length varying between 28 and 56 cm.

In this note we present the geometrical and electrical measurements carried out on the preseries of electrodes used in the production of the presampler "module-0". The electrode preseries have been ordered from different companies in order to evaluate their ability to meet the requirements as well as to understand the difficulties of large scale production.

The module assembly procedure is recalled in section 2, the design of the presampler electrodes and the stringent requirements on their fabrication are presented in section 3. Since the production of the electrodes and especially the anodes is at the limit of what can be required from printed circuit boards manufacturers a careful checking of their electrical and geometrical properties is needed before the module assembly. To carry out electrical tests, a testbench has been developed whose design is presented in section 5. More than 2000 electrodes required to the production of the two first full scale presampler sectors (presampler module 0) have been tested electrically and geometrically. The results of the measurements are presented in section 4 and 5.

Measurements on the fully assembled sectors have been carried out at Institut des Sciences Nucleaires de Grenoble and are presented in [2]. Performance in beam tests of a presampler module built with "module-0" electrodes is presented in [3].

## 2 The Module Production Technique

The module production is under responsability of Institut des Sciences Nucleaires in Grenoble. The technique selected for the module production affects the tolerances on the electrodes and is therefore briefly described here. The anode and cathode electrodes are held between two parallel glass-epoxy FR4+ plates (figure 1). The electrodes are glued along their top and bottom edges to the plates with epoxy pre-impregnated prepreg foils [4].

Footnote †: FR4 is a fire retardant epoxy resin/glass cloth laminate

The electrodes are first positioned in a jig by precise shims. Then, the prepreg foils and the plates are applied with a proper pressure on the top and bottom of the electrodes by means of tightening screws mounted on the jig. To symmetrise the mechanical structure, especially in view of reducing the deformations due to the thermal contraction, the glass epoxy-fibre plates are coated with prepreg foils on both sides when possible. The pre-impregnated foils are 0.4 mm thick prior to polymerization and have a high epoxy impregnation density, to ensure good mechanical stability of the glue joint. Finally the modules undergo a polymerization cycle that lasts approximately 16 hours in an autoclave with well defined temperature ramps and plateaus.

## 3 The Electrodes

The pres ampler is made of 64 sectors where each sector is made of 8 modules of different sizes depending on their position in \(\eta\). Table 1 shows the main parameters of the different modules [5].

The total number of presampler electrodes will be approximately 95000 including spares. Half of them are anode electrodes which are 3-layered circuit boards, whose outer layers are kept at a 2 kV positive potential while the inner signal layer is close to ground potential. Therefore the anode electrodes requires a careful check of their high voltage properties as well as a measurement of their decoupling resistors and the electrode capacitance. The electrical requirements and measurements are described in section 3.2 and 5 respectively. The assembly procedure also puts requirements on the quality of the electrode cutting during the production. The electrode geometry requirements and measurements are detailed in section 3.1 and 4.

### The Electrode Geometry

#### 3.1.1 Thickness

The cathode electrodes (see figure 2) are double sided printed circuit boards obtained by using 200 \(\mu\)m FR4 covered with 35 \(\mu\)m of copper on each side, giving a total thickness of 270 \(\mu\)m.

The anode electrodes (see figure 2) are 3-layered printed circuit boards that are produced by starting from 150 \(\mu\)m FR4 which is covered with 18 \(\mu\)m of copper on each side. On one side of the anode two prepreg layers of 65 \(\mu\)m (after curing) and a 18 \(\mu\)m copper layer are added. The nominal thickness is 330 \(\mu\)m.

The thickness of the prepreg after curing can easily deviate from its nominal value depending on the treatment applied by the manufacturer. Schematic views of the electrode structures are shown in figure 2. The tolerances on the anode and cathode thicknesses given by the assembly tools are \(330^{+30}_{-40}\)\(\mu\)m and 270\(\pm\)30 \(\mu\)m respectively. The upper limit is set by the maximum slit size of the module production jig. The lower limit for the anodes is slightly extended to allow for more variation in the prepreg lamination. Nevertheless the requirements on the thickness of the anode electrodes are not easily fulfilled and each electrode needs to be verified before module assembly.

#### 3.1.2 Height

In the modules spanning from \(\eta\)=0.0 to 0.2 (modules type 1) and from 0.2 to 0.4 (modules type 2) the electrodes are slanted at two different slant angles. This implies that the electrodes in these modules have to be higher so that the presampler thickness remains constant. Together with the modules where the electrodes are not slanted (modules 3 to 8) this leads to three different types of anode and cathode electrodes: anodes and cathodes size 1 for modules type 1, anodes and cathodes size 2 for modules type 2, anodes and cathodes size 3 for modules type 3 to 8.

Since the modules will be produced by gluing the electrodes along their edges onto the glass-epoxy plates, it is necessary that all electrodes have the same height. If not, then only the highest electrodes will be glued on their top and bottom edges, while the shorter electrodes will be loose. To avoid this, the tolerance on the height of the electrodes is \(\pm\)100 \(\mu\)m. Drawings of cathodes type 1 and anodes type 3 are shown in figures 3 and 4.

Figure 2: _Cross section of a cathode (left) and of an anode (right). The central copper layer of the anode is the readout layer, capacitively coupled to the outer layers._

#### 3.1.3 Length

The presampler sectors will have to be assembled to form a polygonal shape in the R\(\phi\) plane. The sectors must join correctly, to neither leave any space in \(\phi\) nor overlap, which would lead to problems during the assembly. Therefore the tolerance on the length of the electrodes has been set to \({}^{+0}_{-200}\)\(\mu\)m.

### Electrical Requirements

The cathode electrodes are double sided printed circuit boards. They will be grounded and do not require special testing of their electrical properties.

During operation at liquid argon temperature the anodes must withstand a potential difference of 2 kV between the inner copper layer (signal layer) and the two outer layers. Any leakage current will contribute to the noise level in the module. A large leakage or a short circuit would make the module unusable. It is therefore required that the electrodes withst and 3 kV in tests in air with a leakage current smaller than 5 nA and without sparking. This requirement is compatible with the breakdown voltage limit of 750 V per 25 \(\mu\)m for standard FR4 material and prepreg.

Four 1 M\(\Omega\) high voltage resistors are soldered onto each anode. These resistors connect the high voltage supply line to the outer layers of the anode electrodes. Their purpose is to ensure a protection of the readout electronics against sparks and short circuits. Bad connection of one of the resistors would lead to the non distribution of the high voltage on one outer copper layer, thus leading to a dead cell. For this reason the connection of the resistors has to be verified.

### Electrode Production Details

Normally a \(<\pm 10\%\) absolute tolerance on the thickness of thin printed circuit boards is considered to be on the limit of the standard production technique. By taking a few precautions during the production the required tolerance can however be easily obtained. The cathode thickness of 270 \(\mu\)m is a standard thickness of base material for printed circuit board manufacturing. By using a better tolerance class (III) than what is generally used or by selecting individual sheets of the copper covered FR4 prior to production, the tolerance of \(\pm 30\mu\)m can easily be fulfilled, provided that care is taken that copper plating for the connections between the layers is only applied at the connection tab, where no strict thickness tolerance is demanded.

The \({}^{+30}_{-40}\mu\)m thickness tolerance of the anode is however harder to obtain. The thickness can easily vary due to the curing process of the prepreg used by the manufacturer. The double sided 150 \(\mu\)m copper (2x18 \(\mu\)m) clad FR4 board from which the anode production starts, has as for the cathode to have a good tolerance class or be selected to have the required thickness. The manufacturer then has to take care to carefully control the prepreg curing process and preferably use a vacuum press (autoclave), which has been shown to give a better result than a hydraulic press. The copper plating to achieve a connection between the layers must be applied at the connection tabs, not to deteriorate the thickness tolerance. A manufacturer may use a different thickness of the additional copper sheet to compensate for deviation from the nominal average thickness of the prepreg layer. For the boards in this report all manufacturers had chosen to put electrolytic copper over the whole electrode surface since this requires two operations less in the processing thus reducing the cost.

In all other aspects the production follows the standard procedure used by printed circuit board manufacturers. The final boards have a bare copper surface cleaned by pumice blasting and are eventually rinced in deionized water.

### Electrode Preseries

To understand the precision with which the electrodes can be produced and evaluate the ability of the different manufacturers to meet the requirements the different electrode sizes for "module-0" were ordered from different companies.

Anodes and cathodes size 1 were produced by a single manufacturer, anodes and cathodes size 3 by a second manufacturer and anodes and cathodes size 2 by two other manufacturers. The manufacturer of cathodes size 2 was never able to produce acceptable anodes while the company that produced anodes size 2 was far too expensive. These electrode preseries were cut by milling. With this technique care has to be taken to hold the boards in place when cutting since the vibrations and movements will result in insufficient precision.

A better precision in the cutting is expected by punching the boards rather than milling. However punching requires expensive precise tools. Such a tool was made after the production of the module-0 electrodes. For comparison the profile of a few electrodes cut by using this tool has been measured (see section 4.2).

Geometry Measurements

### Thickness Measurements

The thickness measurements reported here were performed by hand with a friction clutch micrometer. The measurements were read out and stored by a standard personal computer.

In order to detect a thickness variation within an electrode the thickness is measured at 10 different points as shown in figure 5. To give a correct measurement, the micrometer must be zeroed between measurements and the surface of the electrode must be clean. The repeatability of the friction clutch was found to be \(\pm 1\)\(\mu\)m. No absolute calibration other than the factory performed one was made. The absolute error is assumed to be \(\pm 1\)\(\mu\)m according to the micrometer specifications [6].

Table 2 contains a summary of the thickness measurements carried out on module-0 electrodes. The average thickness measured on cathode electrodes size 3 is 242 \(\mu\)m which is significantly lower than the required average thickness. The reason for this is that a wrong copper thickness (17\(\mu\)m instead of 35\(\mu\)m on each side) was used in the production. However the cathode electrodes size 3 had still a small spread which indicates

Figure 5: _Outline of an anode. The points 1 to 10 show where the thickness was measured while the points “a” to “d” show the contacts for electric connections._

that a production with the correct copper thickness would lead to 98.7% of the cathodes being within the thickness tolerances. Beside this mistake it appears as expected that the thickness specifications are better fulfilled for cathode electrodes than for anode electrodes which have a more complex intern structure.

Table 2 shows that the thickness specifications of the anodes are fulfilled with varying success. Some preseries are well fulfilling specifications while other are far from the required quality.

To verify the internal structure of the electrodes and measure the thickness of individual internal layers slice cuts of an anode for module 3 to 8 and a cathode for module 3 to 8 were made (see figure 9). They show that the cathode size 3 have a thinner copper layer, \(\sim\)23 \(\mu\)m instead of the foreseen 35 \(\mu\)m. The anodes have slightly thicker copper on the outer layers (\(\sim\)26 \(\mu\)m) compared to the nominal 18 \(\mu\)m found for the inner layer. This indicates that copper was added to the outer layers during the processing. The _prepreg_ was found to be \(\sim\)135 \(\mu\)m compatible with the expected thickness of two layers of prepreg quality 1080.

### Contour Measurements

#### 4.2.1 Measurement Setup

The measurement set up uses a profile projector [7]. The two main elements of the profile projector are a movable table where the electrode under study is put and an optical part.

Three wheels allow the table to be moved by hand in three orthogonal directions. The two horizontal directions are called X and Y and the vertical axis is called Z. The table is equipped with precise optoelectrically read out glass rulers giving the position with an accuracy of \({}^{+0.5}_{-1.5}\)\(\mu\)m in Y and \({}^{+0.0}_{-3.5}\)\(\mu\)m in X 4. The Z direction is used to set the focus on the electrode. Two counters linked to the table show the current X and Y coordinates.

Footnote 4: Rulers were calibrated by Mitutoyo technicians at our institute.

To be able to easily place the electrodes parallel to the X direction of the table (for length measurements) a jig has been mounted on the table and placed parallel to the X direction with a precision of a few microns. Then the electrode only needs to be placed against the jig to be parallel to the X direction. A thin plastic plate is placed on top of the electrode to keep it flat.

The contour of the electrode is projected on a screen whose diameter is about 30 cm. Lines are drawn on the screen to be used as a reference. The surface of the electrode is magnified 100 times to achieve a sufficient sensitivity in the contour measurement.

#### 4.2.2 Measurements

The contour measurements have been carried out on samples from each company. The height of each electrode is measured at its two extremities.

The length could not be measured in one single measurement since the table was not long enough. The length measurement was therefore done as follows. A reference point on the electrode was chosen, like one edge of one hole. The length between one end and the hole was measured, the electrode was then moved and the length between the other end

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} \hline Heights & Anodes 1 & Anodes 2 & Anodes 3 & Cathodes 1 & Cathodes 2 & Cathodes 3 \\ \hline \hline Average & 14308 & 13318 & 13052 & 14356 & 13267 & 12993 \\ Height (\(\mu\)m) & \(\pm 4\) & \(\pm 5\) & \(\pm 5\) & \(\pm 3\) & \(\pm 4\) & \(\pm 5\) \\ \hline R.M.S.

Note that the errors given for the average thickness are the statistical errors calculated with the number of electrodes measured and the root mean square of the distribution._and the same hole edge is measured. The two lengths were added to give a measurement of the entire length.

The length of the cathode electrodes could not be measured with this method since they do not have any particular point that could be used as reference. For this reason their length was not measured on module-0 preseries.

To fully assess the precision of the punching technique a destructive method has been used on a small number of punched cathode boards. A thin reference was drawn on the copper surface, so that the same procedure as for anodes could be used.

The results of the measurements are shown in tables 3, 4, 5 and 6.

#### 4.2.3 Interpretation of the Results

The contour measurements show that the anode lengths in the module-0 preseries were not fully satisfactory. The electrodes in the module-0 preseries were cut by milling the printed circuit board to the right contour. By using the punching technique a much better precision in the cutting was obtained. The measurements show that the spread of the distributions of length and height of punched electrodes are significantly smaller than the spread of the distributions of the module-0 preseries. Furthermore none of the electrodes cut by punching was outside the specifications.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \hline Heights & Anodes 1 & Anodes 3 & Cathodes 1 & Cathodes 3 \\ \hline \hline Average & 14 316 & 13023 & 14 313 & 13025 \\ Height (\(\mu\)m) & \(\pm 2\) & \(\pm 4\) & \(\pm 3\) & \(\pm 3\) \\ \hline R.M.S.

Note that the errors given for the average thickness are the statistical errors calculated with the number of electrodes measured and the root mean square of the distribution._

#### 4.2.4 Accuracy

To evaluate the precision of the measurements the length and height of a single electrode were measured 30 times. The electrode was removed and replaced against the jig before each new measurement. It follows from this that the accuracy in the measurement of the height is \(\pm 4\)\(\mu\)m (Y direction) and \(\pm 24\)\(\mu\)m for a length measurement (X direction). Since to measure the entire length two measurements are necessary the error is increased to \(\pm 34\)\(\mu\)m (assuming that the two measurements are uncorrelated). The systematic errors of the glass rulers quoted earlier (\({}^{+0.5}_{-1.5}\)\(\mu\)m in Y and \({}^{+0.0}_{-3.5}\)\(\mu\)m in X) are negligible compared to the statistical errors.

### Testbench

The purpose of the testbench is to measure the electrical properties of the anode electrodes. An anode electrode is equivalent to the electric diagram shown in figure 10. Four 1 M\(\Omega\) decoupling resistors are soldered on the anodes to protect the readout electronics against sparks and short circuits and to allow signal coupling to the inner layer. The capacitances arise from the capacitive coupling between the inner signal copper layer parallel to the outer copper layers.

The testbench has to measure the _leakage current_ between the signal layer and the outer layers when a 3 kV potential is applied to the outer layers with the signal layer grounded. The testbench must also be able to detect one or several non connected resistors. The latter is done by measuring the _capacitance and the series resistance_ (RC) between the inner and the outer layers.

The RC measurements are carried out by a LCR meter (Hewlett Packard 4263A). The leakage current under high voltage is measured by a non-destructive insulation tester (Danbridge JP15). This device does not allow a resolution better than 2 nA, which sets the tolerance limit on the leakage current.

The contact points on the electrodes for the high voltage and the RC measurements are the same (points \(a\) to \(d\) in figure 5). However the LCR meter must never be in contact with the high voltage. To be able to carry out the RC and the high voltage measurements separately, the testbench has two arms as shown in figure 11, one equipped for the RC

Figure 10: _Electric circuit equivalent to an anode viewed by the testbench. The dashed lines represent connections made by the testbench itself during the measurement, so that the points c and d are connected together as well as points a and b. The points a, b, c, d correspond to the different connection pads of the anode and are also shown in figure 5. c and d are the contacts to the high voltage lines and points a and b are the two readout strips of the inner layer._

measurements and one for the high voltage measurements. Each arm has four spring loaded probes to make the contact between the connection pads of the electrode and the tester, either the LCR meter or the insulation tester.

Figure 11: _Picture of the testbench._

The arms of the testbench can be in three positions :

* the _Rest Position_,
* the _High Voltage Position_ where the arm equipped for the high voltage measurement is in contact with the electrode,
* the _LCR Position_ where the arm equipped for the resistance and capacitance measurements is in contact with the electrode.

To allow an anode electrode to be removed or inserted into the testbench while another is being measured, thus increasing the measurement speed, the testbench is built with a rail on which two holders matching the electrode layout are mounted (the holders are visible in figure 11).

Protection against high voltage for human and material safety is achieved by a plexiglas plate covering the testbench and a switch ensuring that high voltage is _on_ only during the high voltage measurements. The mechanical aluminium structure of the tester is grounded. The holders are made of _Delrin_ to provide a good electrical insulation.

The arms are mechanically linked so that they cannot be in position for measurement at the same time. They are motor operated. Three microswitches give the position of the two arms. A fourth switch located under the rail carrying the holders forbids the movement of the arms if the holders are not in position for measurement.

The testbench is controlled by a personal computer equipped with a GPIB card and a Lab PC+ I/O board, running a program written in LabViewP. A home made interface was built to control the motor of the testbench and the high voltage tester. The LabView program commands the movements, triggers the measurements, acquires and stores the data and tells the operator if the anode electrode passes the selection criteria, if it has a short circuit, if it needs to be repositionned in the holder or if one or more resistors are badly soldered. The measurement of the capacitance, resistance and high voltage leakage current for one anode takes about 15 seconds.

### High Voltage Measurements

#### 5.2.1 Verification of the probe-anode connections

To ensure the quality of the anode electrodes it is crucial to make sure that during the automatised high voltage tests the high voltage has been properly applied between the signal and the outer layers of the anode electrodes. The testbench has therefore to check that the probes are well connected to the anode during the test.

The charge current, when the high voltage is switched on, depends on the RC of the load. The anodes consist of 4 separate RC nets that are connected in parallel by the test probes. If one or more probes have a bad contact with the anode then the charge current will be lower than if all probes are in good contact. Due to the construction of the Danbridge device the ramp up of the high voltage results in an almost linear increase of the current during the first few milliseconds.

If all probes are well connected to the anode, the current reaches its internal limit after \(\sim 3.5\)ms as seen in figure 12. If one probe is not in contact with the anode (resulting in only one half of the anode to be tested) the current limit is reached after \(\sim 4.3\)ms. If there is no contact between the probes and the anode the charge current is no longer linear as shown in figure 12 and the current limit of the high voltage tester is never reached.

By requiring the time to reach the current limit to be smaller than 3.8ms one can assure a good connection during the high voltage test. However the measured times show a large spread towards larger values. Applying the 3.8ms time limit would therefore require to test each anode in average 2.4 times on each side to pass the test.

Because of the mechanical design of the testbench if one probe is not in contact with the anode only two scenarios are possible:

* All other probes are not in contact and the current limit is never reached, or
* At least two probes are in contact with the anode. In this case the distance between the badly connected probe(s) and the anode has to be very small and can only give rise to a small voltage drop without visible sparks. In this case the high voltage insulation of the anode is properly tested though the imperfect contact between one of the probes and the anode.

For these reasons a limit of 9ms on the time to reach the current limit is sufficient to ensure a proper high voltage testing of the anode electrodes.

#### 5.2.2 Leakage current measurements

After 10 seconds of applying the high voltage the remaining current is measured. Its value is read out from the insulation tester and sent to an ADC in the PC. The output of the insulation tester has been calibrated using a 1 G\(\Omega\) resistor, to ensure a correct current

Figure 12: _Current pulse with good connection between the probes and the electrode pads (left) and no connection (right)._

scale. The obtained value is then compared to an allowed leakage current limit set to 5 nA, corresponding to 2 \(\sigma\) of the resolution of the insulation tester.

The first high voltage measurements showed that more than 10% of the anode electrodes exhibited a leakage current between 5 nA and 20 nA. The surface of these electrodes as well as the surface of the Delrin anode holders were then washed with alcohol. Repeating the high voltage measurements revealed that for two thirds of the anodes the leakage current had decreased to under 5 nA after the washing. This shows that part of the leakage current actually goes through the impurities at the surface of the anodes and the holders. However the leakage current could not be completely removed or even lowered under 5 nA for a certain number of anodes. This indicates that some current goes through the insulator itself. The results of the measurement of 1089 anode electrodes after washing are summarised in table 7.

### Capacitance and Series Resistance Measurements

The series capacitance and resistance are measured for the two halves of the inner layer and the two sides of the outer layer respectively connected in parallel. From the equivalent electric diagram of the anode (see figure 10) one finds that the expected values for R and C are 0.25 M\(\Omega\) and 1.2 nF respectively. The LCR meter uses a 1 kHz frequency signal for the measurement.

Figure 13 shows the resistance and capacitance distributions for 1087 anode electrodes. The contact probes on the testbench have been resoldered twice between different electrode batches because of contact problems with the electrode pads. After these modifications the LCR meter was not recalibrated leading to large systematic errors on the resistance measurements, as shown by the three peaks in the right hand plot in figure 13.

During the tests of 1087 electrodes about 5 % were found to have incorrectly soldered resistors and were resoldered. The average resistance of the 1087 anode electrodes after resoldering is 251.9\(\pm\)0.2(stat) k\(\Omega\) (the systematic error due to recabling between batches is about 2 k\(\Omega\)) and the average capacitance is 1.27\(\pm\)0.04(stat) nF. Note that the systematic errors due to the instrument itself are negligible. The capacitance of the electrodes depends essentially on the thickness of the prepreg and the FR4 layers. These thicknesses are difficult to control during the production leading to a spread in the capacitance distribution.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline Type of leakage current & Number of anodes \\ \hline Short circuit & 2 \\
20 \(nA\leq i_{leakage}\) & 1 \\
5 \(nA\leq i_{leakage}\leq 20\ nA\) & 37 \\ \(i_{leakage}\leq 5\ nA\) & 1049 \\ \hline Total anodes & 1089 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 6 Conclusion

The tests carried out on the electrodes for the construction of the two first final presampler sectors allowed to install and test a set up for electrode measurements and the development of a testbench for fast electrical tests of the anodes.

The electrical tests carried out on thousand anode electrodes from module-0 preseries showed that there was no major problem to fulfil the electrical requirements. Only 3.6% of the anodes had a somewhat too high leakage current and less than 0.2% of the anodes had a short circuit.

The geometry measurements showed that large scale production will probably require to check thickness of all anode electrodes with a fast procedure while tests of small samples of cathode electrodes should be sufficient.

The measurements of the electrode contour indicates that the required precision is on the limit of what is achievable with the milling technique and will require careful adjustments by the manufacturer. The preseries of punched electrodes shows that this technique is accurate enough to fully meet the specifications.
