Introduction

The \(t\bar{t}H\) associated production with the \(H\to b\overline{b}\) decay channel is considered as a discovery channel for both SM and MSSM Higgs scenarios for Higgs boson masses in the range 80-130 GeV [1]. The semileptonic decay of one of the top quarks provides an isolated high \(p_{T}\) lepton to trigger the experiment. The reconstruction of both top-quarks, required by the selection algorithm, reduces the combinatorial background to the \(m_{bb}\) mass spectrum for the signal itself and suppresses, otherwise significant, \(W+jet\) background. The only dominant background to this channel remains the \(t\bar{t}jj\) background. The true \(t\bar{t}b\overline{b}\) events contribute about 60 % to the total background. For an integrated luminosity of \(30fb^{-1}\) about 61 signal and 150 background events, giving a significance of \(S/\sqrt{B}\) of 5\(\sigma\), are expected inside the mass window for the Higgs mass of 100 GeV. For collected \(100fb^{-1}\) (\(30fb^{-1}\) with low luminosity and \(70fb^{-1}\) with high luminosity) the 5\(\sigma\) can be reached for the Higgs mass of 120 GeV.

The above estimates (see [7] for more details) were obtained with the PYTHIA 5.7 Monte Carlo generator. The \(t\bar{t}\) production was generated and additional jets (b-jets) were obtained from the initial and final state radiation (parton shower). It is well known, however, that the parton shower might be giving results on the hard jets multiplicity, being much below, factor 2-3, than these obtained with matrix element calculations. Such comparisons in case of multijet events [5], and W+jets events [6], have been already documented. In the case of multi-b-jet final state this effect might however be compensated by the enhanced gluon splitting into heavy flavours, with respect to what is expected from the lowest order matrix element calculation. In the study presented below for the \(t\bar{t}b\overline{b}\) background rates, estimates obtained with PYTHIA Monte Carlo are compared to predictions from the exact matrix element calculations implemented in the CompHEP Monte Carlo.

## 2 Generation of events

The following procedure is applied for the event generation:

* PYTHIA events: events are generated with the activated production channel for \(t\bar{t}\) production (ISUB=81, 82). The initial and final state radiation, hadronisation and decays are activated as well. For consistency with CompHEP, events were filtered on 2 b-quarks, which appear as first ones in the cascade from gluon splitting, with \(p_{T}>15\ GeV\) and \(|\eta|<3.0\). The default setting of parameters gathering QCD physics in PYTHIA is used.
* CompHEP events: events are generated according to the exact matrix element calculated for the \(t\bar{t}b\overline{b}\) process. In the generated a cut is set on the \(p_{T}>15\ GeV\) and \(|\eta|<3\) of the two hard b-quarks which do not originate from the top decay. The generated hard process events are read as an external events by PYTHIA.

## 4 Top quarks reconstruction

The efficiencies for the reconstruction of both top quarks (see [4]), are compared for events generated with CompHEP and PYTHIA.

* The top quark decaying into lepton, neutrino and b-quark is reconstructed with the assumption that the missing transverse energy is equal to the transverse momentum of the neutrino. Up to two solutions for the neutrino longitudinal momentum are possible from the W-mass equation, and the best one minimising \(\chi^{2}\) (see later) is choosen. In about 26% events solution is not found (equation has no real solution).
* The top quark decaying into jets is reconstructed from two non-b-jets with \(m_{jj}=m_{W}\pm 25~{}GeV\) and \(\left|\eta_{j}\right|<2.5\) and from one b-jet.
* The best combination of the (l\(\nu\)b, jjb) is found by minimising value of the \(\chi^{2}=(m_{l\nu b}-m_{top})^{2}+(m_{\,jjb}-m_{\,top})^{2}\).

Table 2 compares the expected efficiencies for the reconstruction of events simulated with CompHEP and PYTHIA. Since in both cases top-quark decays are simulated with PYTHIA one expects rather good agreement between both simulation streams.

Figure 2: _On the left: cone separation for two b-quarks not originating from top decays from CompHEP events for selection A and B (see text and Table 1) On the right: cone separation for two b-quarks not originating from top decays for selection B. Both the results from CompHEP (solid) and PYTHIA (dashed) are shown._what has been shown in [1] and [4] is obtained thanks to the optimised procedure for the jet energy recalibration [10]. Also the distribution presented here, contains only true \(t\overline{t}b\overline{b}\) events, while on Fig. 19 of [4] the total background from all \(t\overline{t}jj\) events was shown.

## 6 Conclusions

Both generation streams give similar results on the expected background rates. The results obtained from PYTHIA seem to give even higher predictions which is rather unexpected. One should not forget, however, that there is a large degree of ambiguity in setting consistently the parameters for the QCD activity in both simulations streams. The important conclusion from this study is however, that a credible predictivity of the PYTHIA generator for this background channel has been confirmed. The results obtained do not degrade the discovery potential of the \(t\overline{t}H\) channel as presented in [1] and [4].

CompHEP is a program which generates Fortran (or C) code of the squared matrix element for the specified hard process. It then uses Vegas to perform the Monte-Carlo phase space integration and to generate the hard process events. These events are stored in a PEV-file (ASCII file with special format: header and events). As these are only hard process events, PYTHIA is used to simulate ISR, FSR, fragmentation and hadronisation. To obtain full physics event facility of "external process" provided by PYTHIA 5.7 is used. In the next step events are simulated with the fast simulation of the ATLAS detector, ATLFAST. The reconstructed jets, isolated particles, \(E_{T}^{miss}\) but also some parton-level information are stored in file atlfast.ntup

Events produced with CompHEP are stored in: /afs/cern.ch/cms/physics/PEVIB/ directory. THIS DIRECTORY IS MAINTAINED BY THE CMS COLLABORATION SO IT MIGHT CHANGE!

The following input files have to be linked into prod/ subdirectory

1. **INPAR.DAT**. This file contains the information path to the pev-file, process name and number of events (actually one should care only this number to be greater then number of events stored in PEV-file, however if you want to run only part of events in PEV-file, set a proper number here)
2. **data**/ directory
3. **run.dat**: ONLY hadronisation option is active from this data file (you can switch on/off ISR,FSR and hadronisation)

TO RUN

1. First check if proper INPAR.DAT.xx file is linked as INPAR.DAT
2. Check if you've put proper hadronisation parameter in run.dat
3. Check user settings of decay channels, which can be found in INITPY routine after the string 'USER SETTINGS'. In this procedure you can also change parameters of independent fragmentation.
4. In PYUPEV routine you can change ISR and FSR \(Q^{2}\) scales (after string ISR Q2 SCALE)5. If you've changed anything in demo.f you should recompile it with'make'
6. run program with'make run' command or by running demo.exe from prod / subdirectory
