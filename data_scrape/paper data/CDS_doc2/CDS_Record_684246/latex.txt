In ATLAS CP violation is studied in the B meson decays. Some of the decay modes, such as \(B_{S}\) decay to \(J/\psi\)\(\eta\) where the \(\eta\) particle decays to two \(\gamma\)'s and \(B_{d}\to J/\psi\)\(K^{*0}\) where the \(K^{*0}\) decays to \(K^{0}\pi^{0}\) require an extensive use of the liquid argon calorimeter. The observability of these channels depends on the capability of the calorimeter to detect the low \(p_{\rm T}\) clusters produced from the decay of \(\eta\) and \(\pi^{0}\) particles to two \(\gamma\)'s. It is also important to clean up the data from the electronics noise and the pile-up effects, consisting of overlapping minimum bias events with mostly soft charged and neutral pions.

One can achieve an \(\eta\) detection efficiency of about 2.26% with a fake rate of about 24% which makes the study of \(B_{S}\to J/\psi\)\(\eta\) feasible. A \(\pi^{0}\) detection efficiency of 9% is obtained but the fake rate amounts to 73%. Subsequently, it is shown that \(B_{d}\to J/\psi\)\(K^{*0}\) mode is rather difficult to study.

Introduction

CP violation is still one of the experimentally least constrained phenomena in the Standard Model description of electroweak interactions. A very fruitful testing ground for this, is the exploration of physics with b-flavoured hadrons. At hadron machines, like the LHC, very precise measurements of CP violation can be done and clear answers on the validity of the Standard Model and the existence of New Physics will be achieved.

The \(B_{S}\) decay to \(J/\psi\)\(\eta\) is a mode similar to \(B_{S}\) decay to \(J/\psi\)\(\phi\) (golden decay mode for the \(B_{S}\) meson). The branching ratio upper limit is \(3.8\cdot 10^{-3}\)[1]. In this channel very small CP-violation effects are expected within the Standard Model. New physics contributions to \(B_{S}\vec{B}_{S}\) mixing could lead to larger CP asymmetries. The \(B_{S}\) decay to \(J/\psi\)\(\eta\) is a pure CP eigenstate decay. As a consequence, there is no need to perform heavy angular analysis to distinguish between final states as it will be the case for the \(J/\psi\)\(\phi\) decay. Similarily to the work presented for \(B_{d,s}\to J/\psi\)\(K_{S}\) in Ref. [2], it has been proposed to extract the angle \(\gamma\) of the Unitarity triangle through measurements of CP asymmetries in the \(B_{d}\to J/\psi\)\(\eta\) process and measurements of the CP averaged widths of the \(B_{d,s}\to J/\psi\)\(\eta\) processes [3].

There are several reasons to investigate the decay mode \(B_{d}\to J/\psi\)\(K^{*0}\) with a subsequent decay \(K^{*0}\to K^{0}\pi^{0}\). The decay branching ratio is much larger, \((1.58\ \pm\ 0.27)\cdot 10^{-3}\)[1], than the decay branching ratio of the gold-plated mode \(B_{d}\to J/\psi\)\(K_{S}\), which is \(5.0\cdot 10^{-4}\)[1]. Similarily to the gold-plated mode, the decay \(B_{d}\to J/\psi\)\(K^{*0}\) can be used to extract the angle \(\beta\) of the Unitarity angle and probe the accuracy of the Standard Model. The \(J/\psi\)\(K^{*0}\) final state is not a pure final CP eigenstate mode, but the final states with different CP quantum numbers can be separated by measuring angular distributions.

The observability of these channels depends on the capability of the calorimeter to detect the low \(p_{\rm T}\)2 photon clusters produced from the decay of \(\eta\) and \(\pi^{0}\) particles to two photons. It is also important to distinguish between clusters produced from single photons and those originating from two photons which end up superimposed into a single cluster in the calorimeter. We need also to distinguish between \(\eta\) and \(\pi^{0}\) particles and to clean the data from the electronics noise and the pile-up effects since this latter produces mostly soft charged and neutral pions.

## 2 Data samples and analysis

We studied the exclusive modes \(B_{S}\to J/\psi\eta\) and \(B_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*0}\). At the generation level, the \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay was forced. For the \(B_{S}\) decay mode, \(\eta\to\gamma\gamma\) decay with a branching ratio of 39.33% was selected. For the \(B_{d}\) decay mode, \(K^{*0}\to K^{0}X\) was selected (\(K^{*0}\to K^{0}\)\(\pi^{0}\) has a branching ratio of 33% and \(K^{*0}\to K^{0}\)\(\gamma\) has a branching ratio of 0.2% [1] and 50% of the \(K^{0}\) decay to \(K_{S}\)). The decay \(K^{*0}\to K^{+(-)}\)\(\pi^{-(+)}\) with a branching ratio of 66.5% was ignored. The LVL1 cuts (\(p_{\rm T}(\mu)>6\) GeV/c, \(|\eta^{*}|<2.5\)) were also applied at the generation level. The event generation was performed using PYTHIA version 5.7 [4] where we chose the production of \(b\overline{b}\), forcing \(\overline{b}\) to decay to \(J/\psi\eta\) (respectively to \(J/\psi K^{*0}\)). The sets of data were used as inputs for a full simulation in the ATLAS detector using the ATLAS Geant3 based program DICE, srt release 1.3.0. The reconstruction was performed using the ATLAS program ATRECON, srt release 1.3.0. A total of 17000 (respectively 20000) fully simulated and reconstructed \(B_{S}\to J/\psi\eta\) (resp. \(B_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*0}\) ) events were obtained. Three samples of about 10000 single particles (\(\eta,\gamma,\pi^{0}\)) have also been used for the detailed study of the particle identification and to perform efficient cuts for pile-up rejection. The Combined Ntuples (CBN-Tuples) [6] facility was used for analysis with PAW and ROOT.

In the Electromagnetic CALorimeter (ECAL), a cluster is defined as the energy deposit inside the region \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=\)0.075 x 1.25, which corresponds to 3x5 cells in the 2\({}^{nd}\) sampling. Clusters defined inside a 3x3 cells region have also been studied. To find cluster candidates the cells of the different samplings are mapped onto towers of size 0.025x0.025 and a sliding window algorithm is used, taking a 3x3 towers and a transverse energy threshold of 1 GeV. The electronics noise and the pile-up were added at the reconstruction level as described in [5].

An algorithm based on the selection of the two clusters of larger transverse energies was applied to build the clusters invariant mass using their kinematical characteristics (E\({}_{\it cluster}\), \(\eta_{\it cluster}\) and \(\phi_{\it cluster}\)). Only 20% of the generated \(\eta\) particles decaying into two \(\gamma\)'s have a \(\gamma\gamma\) opening angle larger than 5\({}^{\circ}\) and a photon transverse energy higher than 1 GeV. Therefore, the \(\eta\) detection efficiency will be limited to 20% due to the resolution of the ECAL and the clusterization conditions. Figures 1 show the kinematical distributions at the generation level for the \(\eta\) particle and its decay products, the \(\gamma\) particles.

Another algorithm has been built to collect events where the shower of the two \(\gamma\)'s from the \(\eta\) decay are overlapping and which are reconstructed as one cluster in the ECAL. This is also the case for the \(\pi^{0}\)'s where most* \(N_{X}^{fake}\): Number of reconstructed X particles not associated to a generated X particle: \(N_{X}=N_{X}^{true}+N_{X}^{fake}\)
* \(N_{X}^{gen}\): Number of generated X particles
* \(N_{X\;\;from\;Y}^{true}\): Number of reconstructed particles associated to a generated X particle belonging to the decay channel Y
* \(N_{X\;\;from\;Y}^{gen}\): Number of generated X particles belonging to the decay channel Y
* Overall X reconstruction efficiency: \[\epsilon(X)=\frac{N_{X}^{true}}{N_{X}^{gen}}\] (3.1)
* X from Y efficiency \[\epsilon(X\;\;from\;Y)=\frac{N_{X\;\;from\;Y}^{true}}{N_{X\;\;from\;Y}^{gen}}\] (3.2)
* fake rate : \[f_{X}=\frac{N_{X}^{fake}}{N_{X}}\] (3.3)

## 4 \(\eta\) reconstruction

### The \(\eta\) decay topology

The main criterium for \(\eta\) identification is the invariant mass of the two \(\gamma\) particles. Hence, for the reconstruction to be possible, two separated clusters are required. Therefore, the following two conditions have to be satisfied:

* The \(\gamma\gamma\) opening angle has to be large enough (\(>5^{\circ}\)) so that the clusters in the ECAL are not superimposed.
* The \(\gamma\) energies have to be sufficient (\(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV) for the cluster to be found by the clusterization algorithm.

The ratio of \(\eta\) particles satisfying these two conditions gives an upper limit to the reconstruction efficiency which can be achieved by the method presented here. As shown in table 1, about 80% of the events are lost because one or both clusters are not found. This is due to the fact that the energy threshold at the clusterization level is set to 1 GeV. In addition, we chose to combine only well separated clusters, therefore the maximum reconstruction efficiency that can be achieved is 14.5%. The expected rate was 20% as explained in section 2.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

### Reconstruction without pile-up

The distribution of the invariant mass for all possible two-cluster-pairs, figure 2**(left)**, shows the eta peak above the combinatorial background. In order to suppress this combinatorial background, we only look at the two clusters of highest transverse energy. Choosing the clusters by total energy (instead of transverse energy ) was shown to give worse results (smaller efficiencies and higher fake rates). The resulting invariant mass distribution is plotted in figure 2**(right)** where the resolution is found to be 32 MeV. 4.0% of the \(\eta\) particles from \(B_{S}\) decays were found in an invariant mass window of \(\pm\,2\sigma\) around the \(\eta\) mass (0.547 GeV [1]), but still 42% of the reconstructed \(\eta\) are fakes. The parameters of the Gaussian fit and the obtained efficiencies are summed up in table 3 (left side).

In the following analysis, an invariant mass window of \(\pm 2\sigma\) will be used.

### Reconstruction with pile-up

When adding the pile-up corresponding to the low luminosity (\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) and the electronics noise, lots of clusters not originating from \(\eta\) but from other particle decays appear as background noise, as can be seen in figure 3**(left)**. Is observed also that the \(\eta\)-mass peak falls dramatically as compared to the case where pile-up is not added. This is partially due to the algorithm selecting clusters of highest energies which is not able to re

Figure 3: Invariant mass of the two highest-\(p_{\rm T}\) clusters, adding pile-up and electronics noise. **(left)** no further event selection cuts applied, **(right)** including event selection cuts applied, see text. A Gaussian fit to the \(\eta\)-mass peak and the two-standard deviation mass range are shown in the figures.

move minimum bias particles energies added at the cell level. Consequently, the reconstruction efficiency falls to 2.9%, while the fake rate increases to 45%. The detailed results are summed up in table 3 (right side).

Using the generation data, the real origins of clusters which produced a two-cluster invariant mass in the 2\(\sigma\) invariant mass window were searched for. As listed up in table 2, the main contributions are coming from charged and neutral pions, photons and noise.

The task is now to suppress everything that doesn't originate from real \(\eta\) decays.

### Cluster rejection

Clusters originating from hadrons or noise can be identified and rejected using geometrical properties of the cluster:

* In order to reject background photons, which have a low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), and the electronics noise, clusters were rejected if the transverse energy is less than 2 GeV. As the photons from \(\eta\) have also a rather low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), this cut alone reduces significantly the \(\eta\) reconstruction efficiency.
* In the ECAL, hadrons are not absorbed as easily as \(e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(\gamma\) particles. They deposit a higher part of their energy in the third sampling of the ECAL and in the first sampling of the hadronic calorimeter. Therefore, clusters were rejected if more than 4% of the total energy is deposited in the third sampling or if more than 10% of the total transverse energy is deposited in the first sampling of the HCAL, see figures 4(a) and 4(b).
* Clusters originating from single photons are narrower than hadronic clusters and clusters from \(\pi^{0}\), which are a superimposition of two photons with slightly different directions. Therefore, clusters were rejected if the total cluster width, calculated using the energy deposition in 40 strips of the first sampling, is larger than eight strips, see figure 4(c).
* Still taking profit of the difference in the cluster width, cuts on the energy leakage were applied: In photonic clusters, most of the energy

\begin{tabular}{|l|c c c|} \hline Cluster origin & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Fraction} \\ \(\eta\) & 785 & \(\hat{=}\) & 72\% \\ \(\pi^{0}\) & 46 & \(\hat{=}\) & 5\% \\ \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) & 30 & \(\hat{=}\) & 3\% \\ \(\gamma\) & 116 & \(\hat{=}\) & 11\% \\ other particles and noise & 102 & \(\hat{=}\) & 9\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

is deposited in a 3x3 cells region in the second sampling. \(E_{33}\) being the energy deposited in this 3x3 window of the second sampling, \(E_{37}\) the energy deposited in a \(3(\eta\ \mathrm{dir.})\mathrm{x7}(\phi\ \mathrm{dir})\) window and \(E_{77}\) the energy in a 7x7 towers window, clusters were rejected if \[\frac{E_{37}-E_{33}}{E_{37}}>20\%\quad\mathrm{or}\quad\frac{E_{77}-E_{37}}{E_ {77}}>20\%\] (4.1) thus demanding that less than 20% of the energy is deposited outside the 3x3 window in both \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) directions, see figure 4(d).
* Rejection against clusters to which point a charged track has not been studied. This would have probably cleaned significantly the events from the background introduced by minimum bias events. Futur works will include it.

The cuts were applied in such a way that the first two clusters (of highest \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\)) passing the cuts were combined for the \(\eta\) reconstruction. While the efficiency fell to 2.26%, as also some real \(\eta\) clusters were rejected, the fake rate could be lowered to 24%. In the obtained invariant mass distribution, as shown in figure 3**(right)**, next to all the noise has disappeared. The detailed reconstruction results are shown in table 4 and the definition of the variables used in table 5. If we use the same cuts on the data without pile-up, the \(\eta\) reconstruction efficiency is found to be equal to 3.28% while the fake \(\eta\) rate is equal to 20%. Therefore, the pile-up is seen to decrease significantly the reconstruction efficiency while it does not increase the fake rate so much.

The same study as above has been done using clusters defined in a 3x3 cells region. The results show that, although there was a significant improvement in the \(\eta\)-mass resolution (passing from 33 MeV to 29 MeV), the

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

energy maxima are found corresponding to the two \(\gamma\), enclosing an energy minimum in between. Clusters were rejected, if this energy minimum is more than 0.4% of the total transverse energy.
* The energy leakage in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) directions are correlated. Clusters were rejected, if \((E_{37}-E_{33})/E_{37}>~{}15\%\) and \((E_{77}-E_{37})/E_{77}>~{}15\%\). Also, clusters were rejected if \((E_{37}-E_{33})/E_{37}>~{}50\%\) or \((E_{77}-E_{37})/E_{77}>~{}50\%\). This corresponds to a selection of the clusters inside the frame shown in figure 5.

These cuts were chosen after a comparative analysis of the cluster properties, showing that the typical \(\eta\) clusters would pass the cuts. The obtained efficiencies are shown in table 6.

In order to associate the single cluster with the generated \(\eta\) particle, the cluster energy was required to be within a window of \(\pm\) 30% around the generated \(\eta\) particle energy. As before, the direction of cluster and generated

Figure 5: Energy leakage in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) direction of \(\eta\to 1\) cluster events and applied cut, see text.

particle had to match within \(2^{\circ}\).

The reconstruction efficiency and the fake rate were not affected by pile-up, because the cluster energies are now superior to the energies of clusters coming from pile-up.

Nevertheless, the obtained fake rate was very high (85%), while the \(\eta\to~{}1\) cluster efficiency was 35%, much higher than the \(\eta\to~{}2\) cluster efficiency. To lower the fake rate and clean the events from high energy minimum bias, clusters pointing to charged tracks must be suppressed. This has unfortunately not been done. It will eventually be applied to futur works.

Due to the high fake, \(\eta\to~{}1\) cluster events were not considered for the \(B_{S}\) reconstruction.

### Conversions in the inner detector

In the inner detector, approximately 20 % of the photons convert into \(e^{+}\)\(e^{-}\) pairs. Depending on the radius where the conversion takes place, some of the clusters from the \(e^{+}\)\(e^{-}\) are separated (not superimposed) and deviated from the original photon direction by the applied magnetic field. In this case, the photon cannot be found using only the ECAL data. However, photon conversions can be reconstructed using inner detector tracks.

The number of reconstructed photon conversions for photons from \(B_{S}\to J/\psi\)\(\eta(\eta\to\gamma\gamma)\) is shown in table 7.

The algorithm used to take into account the conversions for the \(\eta\) reconstruction tries the following combinations, until an invariant mass within the \(\pm 2\sigma\) is found:

1. Two ECAL clusters of highest \(E_{\rm T}\)
2. ECAL cluster of highest \(E_{\rm T}\) and electron track of highest \(p_{\rm T}\)
3. Two electron tracks of highest \(p_{\rm T}\)

In order to suppress fake conversions, conversions were rejected if the \(\chi^{2}\) parameter of the fit of the conversion vertex was superior to 5, value taken arbitrarily. Cluster rejection was not changed.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r r r|} \hline \(\#events\) & 16679 & & \\ \(\#\gamma\) & 25370 & & \\ \hline \hline \(\#\gamma\to 1\)\(cluster\) & 9369 & \(\hat{=}\) & 36.9\% \\ \(\#\) converted \(\gamma\) & 675 & \(\hat{=}\) & 2.7\% \\ \(\#\) converted \(\gamma\), still giving 1 cluster & 361 & \(\hat{=}\) & 1.4\% \\ \(\#\) converted \(\gamma\), no cluster in \(\gamma\) dir. & 314 & \(\hat{=}\) & 1.2\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: Reconstructed photon conversions. Only photons from the decay channel \(B_{S}\to J/\psi\)\(\eta\)\((\eta\to\gamma\gamma)\) were counted.

Taking into account the conversions, the \(\eta\) from \(B_{S}\) efficiency slightly rises from 2.26% to 2.4%, whereas the fake rate rises a little bit. Therefore, the conversions were not considered for the \(B_{S}\) reconstruction, either.

### Consequences for \(B_{s}\to J/\psi\)\(\eta\) reconstruction

Without pile-up, we can easily find the \(\eta\) peak at 0.547 GeV when calculating the two clusters invariant mass. The combinatorial background can be mostly eliminated by combining only the two clusters of highest transverse energy. The efficiency of \(\eta\) reconstruction for \(\eta\) particles from \(B_{S}\) decays is 4.0%. When adding pile-up at low luminosity, this efficiency falls to 2.9%, due to clusters originating from soft charged and neutral pions, as well as large amount of photons (not originating from \(\eta\)), small quantities of other particles (such as electrons and positrons) and electronics noise. They are also responsible for the rather large fake rate (45%). The pions can be suppressed by applying cuts on the energy deposited in the 3\({}^{rd}\) EM-sampling and the 1\({}^{st}\) HCAL sampling, on the cluster width and on the energy leakages in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) directions. Electronics noise and a part of the photon contribution can be eliminated by applying a 2 GeV transverse energy cut. An \(\eta\) from \(B_{S}\) efficiency of 2.26% was achieved. The fake rate being at 24 %, the signal is rather clean.

\(\eta\to 1\) cluster events are difficult for the reconstruction, as the clusters cannot be easily identified.

As the signal events have a low \(E_{\rm T}\), only few photon conversions into \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs were reconstructed. Consequently, adding conversions to the analysis doesn't change the reconstruction efficiency much and gives a higher fake rate.

After having applied the reconstruction algorithm (without single cluster events and conversions) on the physical background, consisting of \(B\to J/\psi\)\(X\) events, the significance of the signal, which is a measure for the cleanliness, was calculated. The signal was found to be visible enough for the physics analysis [7, 8] since the significance was of the order of 100.

## 5 \(K^{*0}\) reconstruction

The reconstruction of the decay channel \(K^{*0}\to K^{0}\pi^{0}(K^{0}\to K^{0}_{S}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\) consists of two tasks: \(K^{0}_{S}\) reconstruction by identifying the \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) pairs (in the inner detector) and \(\pi^{0}\) reconstruction (in the ECAL ). For this work, the focus was on the \(\pi^{0}\) reconstruction; in order to decide wether an inner detector track came from a \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), the truth information was used. For the \(K^{0}_{S}\) reconstruction, the measured momenta and direction of the \(\pi^{0}\) were used.

### \(\pi^{0}/\gamma\) separation

The \(\gamma\gamma\) opening angle of \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decays is so small that almost all \(\pi^{0}\) give only one cluster in the ECAL, as the clusters from the two photons are superimposed. Therefore, some criteria for \(\pi^{0}/\gamma\) separation had to be found. In order to do this, a set of fully simulated single \(\pi^{0}\) and single \(\gamma\) events without electronics noise and pile-up was used and the cluster properties were analyzed and compared. The \(\pi^{0}\)'s/photons were generated with a transverse energy from 1 to 30 GeV.

As the \(\pi^{0}\) clusters are the superimposition of two photon clusters with slightly different directions, the following convention can be used for a differentiation:

* Cluster shape: \(\pi^{0}\) clusters are larger than single photon clusters. For this reason, the total cluster width can be used as a selection criterium, see figure 6(a).
* Second max: The first sampling of the ECAL has a high granularity in the \(\eta\) direction. Therefore, two energy deposition maxima can be identified, corresponding to the two photons, figure 7. Useful information, such as the transverse energy of the second maximum and the minimum between the two maxima is provided by the reconstruction software and can easily be used for differentiation, see figures 6(b) and 6(c).

High photon rejection and acceptable \(\pi^{0}\) efficiencies could be achieved by applying simple cuts on the mentioned cluster properties, as shown in table 8.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline
**Cuts applied** & **Surviving \(\pi^{0}\) rate** & **Surviving \(\gamma\) rate** \\ \hline \(\frac{E21sts1}{E13\,/\cosh\left(\eta_{2}\right)}>0.06\) & & \\ \(\frac{E21sts1-Emins\,1}{E12\,/\cosh\left(\eta_{2}\right)}>0.02\) & 45.0\% & 4.4\% \\ \(\frac{E21sts1}{E13\,/\cosh\left(\eta_{2}\right)}>0.03\) & & \\ \(\frac{E21sts1}{E13\,/\cosh\left(\eta_{2}\right)}>0.015\) & 22.8\% & 2.9\% \\ \(Emins1/E135>0.01\) & & \\ \(E2ts1/E135>0.02\) & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### \(\pi^{0}\) selection

In order to find the \(\pi^{0}\) coming from the \(K^{\,*0}\) decay, the ECAL cluster of highest \(p_{\,\mathrm{T}}\) which passes the chosen cuts was selected. Compared to the \(\pi^{0}\) studied above, the \(\pi^{0}\) concerned here are at lower transverse momentum, and the cuts presented above have to be re-optimized. In addition, the \(\pi^{0}\) we are looking for are energetically rather close to the pile-up as seen on figure 8, wich makes the search even more difficult.

Figure 9(a) shows the correlation between generated and reconstructed transverse momentum: They match within an acceptable range, as the root mean square of \((p_{\mathrm{T}}^{reconstructed}-p_{\mathrm{T}}^{generated})/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{ generated}\) was 0.18, as shown in figure 9(b).

The \(\pi^{0}\) rejection was optimized in order to obtain the lowest possible fake rate. Table 10 shows the applied cuts and the efficiency obtained: The achieved \(\pi^{0}\) from \(K^{\,*0}\) efficiency was 9.0%, while the fake rate was 73%.

The cuts were found by using a simple search algorithm which finds the cut value giving the minimal fake rate, provided that not more than 70% of the real \(\pi^{0}\)'s are rejected. The cuts slightly improve the \(\pi^{0}\) fake rate, but the \(\pi^{0}\) from \(K^{\,*0}(B_{d})\) efficiency has dropped. With and without the cuts applied, approximately the same amount of the real reconstructed \(\pi^{0}\) (38%) is not coming from \(K^{\,*0}\) decays.

### \(K^{0}_{s}\) reconstruction

For the \(K^{0}_{s}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) reconstruction, the inner detector tracks were used for \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) reconstruction.

Several approaches were made in order to reconstruct the \(K^{0}_{s}\) particles. In all cases, the truth (data from generation) was used in order to decide whether a track is coming from a \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\).

inner detector tracks with vertex fit parameter \(\chi^{2}>6\) were rejected. Two of the used methods are presented below

1. **For reference: Use of the simulation truth.** Using the data from generation, the \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) pairs coming from the \(K^{0}_{S}(B_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*0})\) decays were searched for. Consequently, the \(K^{0}_{S}\) fake rate is practically \(\approx 0\). The \(K^{0}_{S}\) from \(K^{*0}(B_{d})\) efficiency was 31%.
2. **Select \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) with best invariant mass.** Finally, each \(\pi^{+}\) was combined with each \(\pi^{-}\), and the combination giving the best invariant mass (closest to the \(K^{0}\) mass) was chosen. The fake rate rises to 85%, and the efficiency drops to 11%.

The detailed results of \(K^{0}_{S}\) reconstruction using these two methods are given in table 11. As before, an invariant mass window of \(\pm 2\sigma\) was used for all analysis. The invariant mass distributions are shown in figure 10.

An optimized \(K^{0}_{S}\) reconstruction method using specific cuts on the tracks and vertexing is described in [10], where an efficiency of 41% was achieved. This study can be used to improve our results.

### \(K^{*0}\) reconstruction

The last step is to combine the reconstructed \(K^{0}_{S}\) with the \(\pi^{0}\) particles in order to reconstruct the \(K^{*0}\) particle. The best results were obtained by combining the best invariant mass method for the \(K^{0}_{S}\) with the cuts for the \(\pi^{0}\) as described above; The \(K^{0}_{S}-\pi^{0}\) invariant mass distribution is shown in figure 11; the reconstruction results are listed up in table 12. The obtained efficiency with this method was 1.2% with a fake rate of 75%. If

### \(K^{\,0}\) reconstruction

Note that in this later case the fake rate is 85%, but the level of the combinatorial background cannot be seen, because only a narrow mass window around the nominal \(K^{0}_{S}\) mass was considered.

we try to select the \(\pi^{0}\) clusters pointing to the \(K^{0}_{S}\) momentum direction, we might reduce the background and improve the reconstruction efficiency significantly. This task has not been done yet.

### Consequences for \(B_{d}\to J/\psi\)\(K^{*0}\) reconstruction

Whereas \(\pi^{0}/\gamma\) distinction appears not to pose big problems at higher transverse momentum, no effective distinction criterium could be found which could have helped to identify the neutral pions from \(K^{*0}\) decays. Some cuts were found which slightly ameliorate the fake rate but which reject also many real \(\pi^{0}\) particles. The cuts had the same impact on the \(K^{*0}\) reconstruction: The fake rate dropped by some percent, but a great amount of \(K^{*0}\) was lost, too. Table 13 gives a short overview of the \(K^{*0}\) efficiencies obtained by the different methods.

It appears that the \(K^{*0}\) reconstruction could still be rescued by a better \(K^{0}_{S}\) reconstruction method, as the \(K^{*0}\) fake rate is at a rather low level if the truth is used for the \(K^{0}_{S}\), even if the \(\pi^{0}\) fake rate is very high. Selecting \(\pi^{0}\)'s only around the \(K^{0}_{S}\) direction (instead of taking the whole \(\pi^{0}\) angular spectrum), might reduce the background significantly, thus improving the reconstruction efficiency. In addition, a big part of the \(K^{*0}\) should possibly be suppressed if the combination with the \(J/\psi\) particle is done in order to

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|r|} \hline \(\pi^{0}\) **selection** & \(K^{0}_{S}\) **reconstruction** & \(K^{*0}(B_{d})\) **efficiency** & \(K^{*0}\) **fake rate** \\ \hline no cuts & using the truth & 5.0\% & 12\% \\ no cuts & best inv. mass & 2.2\% & 77\% \\ cuts applied & using the truth & 3.0\% & 11\% \\ cuts applied & best inv. mass & 1.2\% & 75\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 13: \(K^{*0}\) reconstruction: Summaryreconstruct the \(B_{d}\) meson.

Making the most optimistic assumptions, and assuming additionally that the \(J/\psi\) particles can be reconstructed with a good efficiency and a very low fake rate, the \(B_{d}\) signal significance should be at least \(\approx 60\).

## 6 Conclusion

The goal of this work was to find strategies to identify low \(p_{\rm T}\)\(\gamma\), \(\eta\) and \(\pi^{0}\) particles from \(B_{S}\to J/\psi\)\(\eta\) and \(B_{d}\to J/\psi\)\(K^{\ast 0}\) decays and to give estimates on the reconstruction efficiencies which will be achieved in the ATL AS detector at LHC.

Using cuts on cluster width, energy leakage and energy deposition in the third ECAL and first HCAL sampling, the clusters from \(\eta\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) could be identified, rejecting the major part of hadronic jets and noise. An \(\eta\) reconstruction efficiency of 2.26% could be achieved; the ratio of fake \(\eta\) particles being at 24%, the reconstruction can be said to be sufficiently clean. In combination with the \(J/\psi\) reconstruction [7, 8], the expected significance of the \(B_{S}\) signal was found to be sufficiently high (\(\approx 100\)).

\(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation, needed to identify the \(\pi^{0}\) particles from \(K^{\ast 0}\) decays, seemed to be feasible at high \(p_{\rm T}\) (\(\approx 1-30\) GeV), using the substructure of the clusters (second maximum, cluster width). Unfortunately, the \(\pi^{0}\) from \(K^{\ast 0}\) are at low \(p_{\rm T}\) (some GeV) and energetically at the same level as the pile-up. Therefore, the identification is much more difficult. Nevertheless, a reconstruction efficiency of 9% could be achieved, whereas 73% of the reconstructed \(\pi^{0}\) were fakes. Thereby, the measurement of the transverse momentum satisfies the requirements. It was shown that a large part of the fake pions can be rejected by combining them with the \(K_{S}\) particles (\(K^{\ast 0}\) reconstruction), using an optimal \(K_{S}\) reconstruction algorithm. Despite the difficulties we encountered for obtaining a clean \(\pi^{0}\) signal, the significance of the \(B_{d}\) signal was found to be satisfying (\(\approx 60\)).
