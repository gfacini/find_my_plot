Abstract

The possibility to search for SUSY signatures by looking for high Pt leptons and jets in the final state and without using the missing transverse-energy (\(\rm E_{t}^{\rm miss}\)) information is investigated. The search for SUSY with the use of the leptonic signature could provide an important redundancy to strength and support an early SUSY discovery, being affected by different systematic uncertainties with respect to the \(\rm E_{t}^{\rm miss}\) one.

## 1 Introduction

It has been shown that even with very small integrated luminosity the missing transverse-energy (E\({}_{\rm t}^{\rm miss}\) ) signature will allow to discover SUSY with very simple selection criteria [1]. On the other hand the E\({}_{\rm t}^{\rm miss}\) signature could be affected by large systematic uncertainty in the first data taking period. In this note it is assumed that the ATLAS detector will be fully installed during the first ATLAS physics run but the missing transverse energy signature _cannot_ be or _it is not_ used.

The idea is then to use the high Pt leptons produced in the cascade decays of the squarks and of the gluinos to select SUSY signals. The presence of high Pt jets in the central region of the detector will be used to further reject the standard model background. As an exercise the effect of one missing calorimeter end-cap is also investigated.

The search for SUSY with high Pt leptons and central jet tag would be a useful channel to confirm a possible excess of events with large E\({}_{\rm t}^{\rm miss}\), which remains the main discovery channels for SUSY.

The signals have been generated in the gravity-mediated SUSY breaking scenario with gaugino and sfermion mass unification at GUT scale (SUGRA) and with R-parity conservation. In this scenario the mass spectrum and the properties of the SUSY particles are determined by 5 parameters:

a) \({\rm m}_{0}\) the scalar mass scale,

b) \({\rm m}_{1/2}\) the gaugino mass scale,

c) \({\rm tan}\beta\) the ratio of the vev's of the two Higgs doublet

d) A0 the trilinear mass term,

e) The sign of \(\mu\) (the absolute value of \(\mu\) is determined by the request of dynamical produced EW symmetry breaking).

## 2 The simulated samples

Different signal points in the SUGRA parameter space have been simulated by using the ISAJET version 7.51 program [2] followed by a fast simulation of the ATLAS detector response performed with the ATLFAST [3] package. The SUGRA points chosen includes some of the points of the Physics TDR [1] (slightly modified to avoid the LEP limits coming from the Higgs bosons searches) and some of the points suggested in [4]. The list of the 13 generated points is given in table 1.

About 10k events per point have been generated. The standard model (SM) processes have been simulated by means of the PYTHIA code [5], followed by the fast detector simulation ATLFAST. The SM backgrounds that are relevant for this work are the ones that contain at least one lepton isolated in the final state. For this reason the processes WW, WZ, ZZ, W-jet, Z-jet, tt, Zbb, Wbb and bb have been simulated. The gauge bosons (W and Z) have been forced to decay to leptons (hereafter a lepton is intended to be an electron or a muon). For the background containing b's the B mesons and the b bar

Since, as explained in Section 3, a hard transverse momentum (Pt) cut is applied to the leptons and to the central jets the SM samples have been generated with a Pt cut on the primary process. The list of the generated SM backgrounds together with their expected cross-sections computed with the PYTHIA program is given in table 2.

For the W-jet, the Z-jet and the bb backgrounds the samples with the Pt cut at 100 GeV have been used to optimize the selection and to estimate the surviving background. For these backgrounds the inclusive samples have been used to estimate the leaking of the low Pt processes in the high Pt selection.

## 3 Selection criteria

A selection mainly based on isolated leptons has been studied. In order to reduce the huge SM background only events with two isolated leptons of the same charge sign or at least three isolated leptons are considered. The isolation criteria are the default ATLFAST ones: for leptons with Pt\(>\)5 GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5 the requests \(\Delta\)R\(>\)0.4 with respect to other clusters and Et\(<\)10 GeV in a \(\Delta\)R=0.2 cone are applied. In order to insure the trigger at least one isolated lepton with Pt\(>\)25 GeV is required. Then two variables based on the isolated leptons are defined: the minimum Pt of the leptons Pt-min and the sum of the absolute values of the Pt of all the isolated leptons Pt-sum. A two-dimensional cut on these two variables is applied depending on the number of isolated leptons identified. If two leptons with the same charge sign are selected then Pt-min must be greater than 40 GeV if 150\(<\)Pt-sum\(<\)300 GeV or Pt-min must be greater than 10 GeV if Pt-sum\(>\)300 GeV. If three or more isolated leptons are selected, then Pt-min must exceed 40 GeV and Pt-sum must be greater than 150 GeV. In addition for both channels the sum of the Pt of the jets in the central region of the detector (\(|\eta|<\)1.36) Pt-jet must be greater than 200 GeV. These selection criteria have been chosen in order to optimize the sensitivity to SUGRA point 5 for 1 fb\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

The distribution of the two leptonic variables for the main SM backgrounds and for the signal are shown in figures 1 and 2 respectively, for the two same-sign and for the three-lepton samples.

The main SM background is given by the two gauge-boson productions: WW, WZ and ZZ. Of this sample 0.136 events per inverse fb of collected luminosity are expected to survive the cuts. Of the other SM backgrounds 0.092/fb\({}^{\text{-1}}\) events from the Z-jet sample are expected to pass the selection.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline SM Process & Pt cut (GeV) & Num. of events / 10\({}^{3}\) & Cross-section (pb) \\ \hline WW, WZ, ZZ & None & 100 & 3.4 \\ \hline tt & None & 750 & 27 \\ \hline W-jet & None & 1500 & 77000 \\ \hline Z-jet & None & 1400 & 9370 \\ \hline bb & 50 & 300 & 3150 \\ \hline W-jet & 80 & 300 & 652 \\ \hline Z-jet & 80 & 300 & 89 \\ \hline W-jet & 100 & 2800 & 343 \\ \hline bb & 100 & 1300 & 261 \\ \hline Z-jet & 100 & 1600 & 49 \\ \hline Z-bb & None & 150 & 33 \\ \hline W-bb & None & 200 & 43 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The selection efficiencies and the number of expected events/fb\({}^{-1}\) of collected luminosity for the different SUGRA signals are reported in table 3. It must be noticed that both the selection efficiency and the production cross section have large variations between the different SUGRA points. The highest efficiency is reached when the sleptons are lighter than the lighter charginos. In this case the chargino decays will produce more high Pt leptons.

In order to evaluate the statistical significance of the selection an appropriate statistical estimator must be defined. Since we are dealing with low statistics the'standard' definition of significance S/N is not applicable. For this reason the results are reported in terms of the expected confidence level for signal plus background experiments assuming the background only hypothesis C\({}_{b}\)(s,b). The mathematical definition of the C\({}_{b}\)(N\({}_{obs}\),b) for given outcome of a counting experiment N\({}_{obs}\) where b background events are expected (i.e., assuming the 'background only' hypothesis) is:

\[C_{b}\left(N_{obs},b\right)=\sum_{k=N_{obs}}\frac{e^{-b}\cdot b^{\ k}}{k!}\,.\]

Very small values of C\({}_{b}\) would imply a discovery (usually the discovery threshold is fixed at a probability of about 6\(\cdot\)10\({}^{\text{-7}}\) corresponding to \(\sim\)5 Gaussian standard deviations). To compute the statistical significance of the selection results the C\({}_{b}\) is computed assuming N\({}_{obs}\)=int(s+b), where s is the number of expected signal events. The value of s+b has been conservatively rounded to its integer part. When the number of background events is smaller than 10 the Poisson probability density function has been used. When b is large (greater than 10) then Gaussian statistics can be used and the C\({}_{b}\) is defined as

\[C_{b}(s,b)=\overline{\int}_{s+b}G(\mu=b,\sigma=\sqrt{b},x)dx\,.\]

The inclusive (i.e., no Pt cut) production cross-sections for the W-jet and Z-jet processes are huge. It is therefore important to evaluate the contribution to the selected background from the processes with lower Pt. In order to do that some extrapolation on the inclusive Pt sample is needed. The ratio of the probabilities of passing the Pt-sum and the Pt-jet cuts of the selection for the inclusive and for the high-Pt sample is computed. This ratio amounts to \(\sim\)6 10\({}^{\text{-5}}\) for the W-jet sample and to about \(\sim\)10\({}^{\text{-4}}\) for the Z-jet sample. These ratios are then multiplied by the ratio of the inclusive to high Pt cross section in order to get an estimate relative contribution to the total background from the inclusive part of the W-jet and of the Z-jet samples. These contributions are estimated to be negligible with respect to systematic error applied to the background expectations as explained in the following. As can be seen in figure 1 the distribution of the bb background is so far from the cuts that no additional uncertainty on the expected background has been added.

To take into account the poor knowledge of the production cross-section a conservative error of 30% has been applied on the expected background by increasing its expectation of this amount. In order to take into

account the systematic error on the signal selection, the identification efficiency for isolated leptons given by ATLFAST has been reduced by 5%.

As an exercise the effect of one missing calorimeter end-cap on this analysis has also been investigated. In order to simulate the missing calorimeter end-cap only leptons (and jets) with 0\(\stackrel{{>}}{{{}_{\sim}}}\)31\({}^{\circ}\) are accepted. The effect of this acceptance reduction is to reduce the signal efficiency by \(\sim\)10-20% relative, depending on the considered SUGRA point. Also the background is slightly reduced going from 0.228 to 0.136 \(\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{f}\mathrm{b}^{\text{-1}}\). The reduction of the background has been conservatively ignored when deriving the results for the misisng end-cap scenario.

The results of the search are used to derive the integrated luminosity needed to reach C\({}_{\mathrm{b}}\)(s,b) equivalent to 5 Gaussian standard deviations. The systematic uncertainties on the signal and on the background expectations have been taken into account as explained in the text. These results are reported in table 4 for the fully instrumented ATLAS detector and for the missing end-cap cases.

## 4 Conclusions

The preliminary studies reported in this note show that for integrated luminosity between 0.2-3.8 \(\mathrm{fb}^{\text{-1}}\) 5 Gaussian-sigma sensitivities can be reached for all the points of the SUGRA parameter space examined with the exception of point 11. This point is characterized by a low production cross-section because of heavy gluinos and squark masses (above 1.5 TeV). It is therefore proved that this analysis would have a good discovery potential for SUSY during the first ATLAS physics run (L\(\sim\)10 \(\mathrm{fb}^{\text{-1}}\)) for squark and gluino masses below \(\sim\)1.3 \(\mathrm{TeV}\).

This signature is systematically and, partially, statistically independent of the missing energy one and can be therefore used to support an eventual SUSY discovery in the first ATLAS physics run. It is also shown that the absence of one of the two end-caps of the ATLAS calorimeter would have a rather small impact on the performance of this analysis.

It should be stressed that this result has been obtained in a quite restrictive scenario (SUGRA) and it would not be difficult to imagine less constrained scenario where the SUSY cascade decays would produce much less energetic leptons, making this analysis inefficient.
