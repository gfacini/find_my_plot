## 1 Introduction

### Physics goals

One of the main tasks of the forward calorimetry ( \(\mid\eta\mid\geq 3\)) is recoil jet tagging in the processes of heavy Higgs production via W or Z fusion, \(W_{L}W_{L}\) scattering, etc. The detail study of heavy Higgs production have been made on the particle level elsewhere (see [1],[2])

Jet resolution and quality of the jet reconstruction in the forward calorimeter is not determined by the intrinsic properties of the calorimeter, but by the general layout of forward region, namely total amount of material in front of the forward calorimeter. The cryostat of the EndCap calorimeter in present design has rather thick walls that has big influence on the jet resolution. This note presents a study of different models for EndCap cryostat from the point of view of the jet reconstruction after full GEANT simulation.

### Software

The simulation was done with DICE version 2.02/07, which is in "/new" area since the end of March. New variant of ATLAS layout has been selected by "INNE 2" and "CENT 2" datacards. Magnetic field has been switched off because it doesn't strongly affect on resolution of 1 TeV jets going into the forward direction but increases computer time. New description of the forward calorimeter was used in simulations. In this description forward calorimeter is situated at the distance of \(15.6\div 18.1\) m from the interaction point. It consists of electromagnetic parallel plate gas calorimeter, hadronic gas tube calorimeter and has a copper shield inside the inner hole (see fig. 1). Such a forward calorimeter now is available in DICE in "/dev" area and can be selected by "FWDC" GEOM 2" datacard. In order to reconstruct jets by means of the standard routines the ATRECON packagehas been updated, so now it knows about presence of the forward calorimeter and uses an information from it at the reconstruction phase.

### Jet production

To produce jets going into the forward direction, events with heavy Higgs (\(m_{H}\) = 1 TeV) have been generated with PYTHIA. Then LUCELL routine has been used to find jets with \(E_{t}>15\) GeV in a cone with \(R\) = 0.5 and all particles belonging to these jets except of muons and neutrinos were stored in jet bank. The energy spectrum of jets is shown in fig. 6.a),b). Their mean energy is about 1 TeV, mean transverse energy is about 70 GeV.

## 2 Study of the cryostat influence

The EndCap calorimeter in layout under discussion has \(\eta\)-coverage up to 3.2 and it is surrounded by the cryostat with double walls. The sketch of the cryostat is shown in fig. 2. Near the beam pipe cryostat has one aluminium wall of 8 mm thick and one steel wall of 6 mm thick. The rare walls of cryostat are made of 40 mm steel. Thus, the cryostat shadows the forward calorimeter up to \(\eta\) = 3.9 and total amount of material in the worst point is about \(1.5\lambda\) or \(11.X_{0}\). Because of such an amount of material the resolution should degrade significantly and we examined another cryostat options, which are schematically shown in fig. 3. We replaced only one (variant 3) or all (variants 4.5,6) steel walls by aluminium walls of 1.5 times thicker. For all these cryostat options we simulated in GEANT response for the jets in rapidity region of 2.6 \(<\mid\eta\mid<4.6\). The ratio of total energy measured in all calorimeters to the original energy of jets is shown in fig. 4. Error bars in all figures are the RMS values of distributions. Figure a) corresponds to the forward calorimeter alone starting at \(\eta\) = 3. The forward calorimeter was calibrated in such a way that \(E^{measured}/E^{generated}\) for the jets would be equal 1 with RMS about 55. One can see that for baseline option (b\({}^{11}\) about 40% of energy are lost. The main reason of such a lost is the leakage of particles outside the \(\eta\) = 3 after the reflection in the cryostat walls. The second reason is the absorption of energy in the walls themselves. For full aluminium-made walls the losses are smaller and the best variant is the cryostat with reverse cone walls. Fig. 5 demonstrates the quality of \(p_{t}\) measurement of jets. Resolution for \(p_{t}\) in shadow region deteriorates even more significantly than the energy resolution.

## 3 Reconstruction of jets

After preliminary study of different cryostats and discussion with engineers the full aluminium cylindrical cryostat has been chosen for further study (see fig. 3.1). The resolution in the forward calorimeter in this case is much better than for steel cryostat and such a cryostat has more realistic construction than the conical ones. A special attention has been paid to the rapidity range 3 <\(\mid\eta\mid\) - 4. Fig. 6.c),d) show total and transverse energy distribution measured in all calorimeters. If we compare this distributions with fig. 6.a),b) we see that about 80 GeV of \(1\)TeV jet are lost. Thus, an attempt to re-calibrate the forward calorimeter in this region have been made. Fig. 7.a),b) show the \(E^{measured}-E^{generated}\) distributions for noncalibrated calorimeter and fig. 8.a),b) for calibrated one. Different recalibration coefficients had been applied in each \(d\eta=0.1\) interval to do \(E^{measured}/E^{generated}\) ratio equal to 1 in each interval, but after such a recalibration RMS of \(E^{measured}-E^{generated}\) distribution increases and we didn't use this calibration in further calculations. The distributions of \(E^{measured}/E^{generated}\) ratio are shown in fig. 9.a),b). The mean energy loss in \(3<\mid\eta\mid<4\) is about 10% and we didn't see long tails of this distribution with 232 events statistics. Dependence of energy losses from \(\eta\) and its RMS are shown in fig. 10. The RMS of energy distribution grows from 4% at \(\eta=2.6\) up to \(\tau\)% at \(\eta=3.6\) and falls down to 5% at \(\eta=4.2\). Very large RMS at \(\eta=4.4\) is due to a single event and at \(\eta=4.6\) The RMS becomes much smaller but still greater than at \(\eta=4.2\) because of energy leakage from calorimeter into collimator. The errors in \(P_{i}\) measurement are much worser and they are shown in fig. 10.c),d).

All distributions mentioned above show the difference in energy of incoming jet and total energy measured in all calorimeters (even in barrel!) The next task is to reconstruct jets in calorimeter using standard jet finding algorithms. Two different algorithms have been used for this purposes (both implemented in ATRECON). First algorithm tries to find the cell with maximum transverse energy and sums all energy in some cone. Another algorithm finds square window \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=2R_{cone}\times 2R_{cone}\) with local maximum. It should be mentioned that in the first case there is one additional parameter, namely threshold on minimal transverse energy of jet initiator (it was 0.5 GeV), which is absent in the second case. Both algorithms give approximately the same results. They found all jets if we set threshold on transverse energy at 8 GeV. Sometimes they found two jets. In this case only a jet with higher \(p_{t}\) was chosen. Distribution of reconstructed energy of jets is shown in fig. 6.e),f). After the reconstruction an additional 10% amount of energy is lost if we sum all energy in cone \(R=0.7\). In fig. 7.c),d, 8.c),d), 9.c),d) different distributions for reconstructed jets are shown. For example, only in one event out of 232 the energy and the transverse energy of reconstructed jet are less than one third of initial energy, i.e. it occurs in less than one percent of events and we can say that rather good distributions of reconstructed energy have the tails at 1% level. Few good and bad events are shown in fig 11-16. Fig. a) shows energy distribution of particles in the jets in \(\eta-\phi\) plane and fig. b) shows the calorimeter response. The worst event is shown in fig. 16. In this event it's very difficult to say that we see jet in calorimeter. \(\eta\)-dependence of reconstructed energy is shown in fig. 17-19. RMS of distribution is about 0.14 at \(\eta=3.6\). Fig. 17 has been obtain using the first algorithm of the jet finding with cone \(R=0.7\). With initial transverse energy of jets greater than 15 GeV and 10 GeV threshold on reconstructed transverse energy, it found 3 events with two jets and 4 events without jets. Sliding window algorithm with the same conditions could not find any jet only in 1 event and found two jets in 1 event. The results of the sliding window algorithm searches are shown in fig. 18. Fig. 17 and 18 coincide even in small details except one bad point at \(\eta=1.1\). Fig. 19 shows the same dependence which has been obtained with the sliding window algorithm but the cone size was reduced to \(R:=0.5\). In this case we lost additional 5% of energy and RMS became a bit worser.

fig. 6.a),b) we see that about 80 GeV of 1TeV jet are lost. Thus, an attempt to re-calibrate the forward calorimeter in this region have been made. Fig. 7.a),b) show the \(E^{measured}-E^{generated}\) distributions for noncalibrated calorimeter and fig. 8.a),b) for calibrated one. Different recalibration coefficients had been applied in each \(d\eta=0.1\) interval to do \(E^{measured}/E^{generated}\) ratio equal to 1 in each interval, but after such a recalibration RMS of \(E^{measured}-E^{generated}\) distribution increases and we didn't use this calibration in further calculations. The distributions of \(E^{measured}/E^{generated}\) ratio are shown in fig. 9.a),b). The mean energy loss in \(3<\mid\eta\mid<4\) is about 10% and we didn't see long tails of this distribution with 232 events statistics. Dependence of energy losses from \(\eta\) and its RMS are shown in fig. 10. The RMS of energy distribution grows from 4% at \(\eta=2.6\) up to \(7\%\) at \(\eta=3.6\) and falls down to 5% at \(\eta=4.2\). Very large RMS at \(\eta=4.4\) is due to a single event and at \(\eta=4.6\) The RMS becomes much smaller but still greater than at \(\eta=4.2\) because of energy leakage from calorimeter into collimator. The errors in \(P\), measurement are much worser and they are shown in fig. 10.c),d).

All distributions mentioned above show the difference in energy of incoming jet and total energy measured in all calorimeters (even in barrel!) The next task is to reconstruct jets in calorimeter using standard jet finding algorithms. Two different algorithms have been used for this purposes (both implemented in ATRECON). First algorithm tries to find the cell with maximum transverse energy and sums all energy in some cone. Another algorithm finds square window \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=2R_{cone}\times 2R_{cone}\) with local maximum. It should be mentioned that in the first case there is one additional parameter, namely threshold on minimal transverse energy of jet initiator (it was 0.5 GeV), which is absent in the second case. Both algorithms give approximately the same results. They found all jets if we set threshold on transverse energy at 8 GeV. Sometimes they found two jets. In this case only a jet with higher \(p_{t}\) was chosen. Distribution of reconstructed energy of jets is shown in fig. 6.e),f). After the reconstruction an additional 10% amount of energy is lost if we sum all energy in cone \(R=0.7\). In fig. 7.c),d,f,c),d) different distributions for reconstructed jets are shown. For example, only in one event out of 232 the energy and the transverse energy of reconstructed jet are less than one third of initial energy, i.e. it occurs in less than one percent of events and we can say that rather good distributions of reconstructed energy have the tails at 1% level. Few good and bad events are shown in fig 11-16. Fig. a) shows energy distribution of particles in the jets in \(\eta-\sigma\) plane and fig. b) shows the calorimeter response. The worst event is shown in fig. 16. In this event it's very difficult to say that we see jet in calorimeter. \(\eta\)-dependence of reconstructed energy is shown in fig. 17-19. RMS of distribution is about 0.14 at \(\eta=3.6\). Fig. 17 has been obtain using the first algorithm of the jet finding with cone \(R=0.7\). With initial transverse energy of jets greater than 15 GeV and 10 GeV threshold on reconstructed transverse energy, it found 3 events with two jets and 4 events without jets. Sliding window algorithm with the same conditions could not find any jet only in 1 event and found two jets in 1 event. The results of the sliding window algorithm searches are shown in fig. 15. Fig. 17 and 18 coincide even in small details except one bad point at \(\eta=1.1\). Fig. 19 shows the same dependence which has been obtained with the sliding window algorithm but the cone size was reduced to \(R\sim 0.5\). In this case we lost additional 5.5 of energy and RMS became a bit worser.

Conclusion

In this note we examined the performance of the forward calorimeter for the jet tagging. It has been demonstrated that almost all jets (with 1% exception) can be reconstructed truly in the forward region in the case of aluminium EndCap cryostat. The transverse energy of jets is 80% of initial energy in the worst place in the shadow of the cryostat. The jet resolution in this place (\(\eta\) = 3.6) is about 15%. All this values depend on the cone radius \(R\). The sliding window algorithm of the jet finding gives a bit better results than the algorithm of the search of a cell with maximum energy.

From our estimations, mismeasurement of jets at 1% level doesn't increase the level of background for such "missing \(p_{t}\)" physics, as \(11\to Z\ Z\to l\ l\ \nu\ \nu\) and it doesn't increase the level of inclusive missing \(p_{t}\) trigger.

All this study have been made with tag jet alone, without underling event. Further investigation should include all particles, a pileup and a noise. As an example, fig. 20-22 show single event with heavy Higgs production on quark, particle and calorimeter level with and without noise and pileup. It is more or less evident from these figures that the quality of the jet reconstruction is determined first of all by pileup. Intrinsic resolution of the forward calorimeter, it's noise and presence of EndCap cryostat in front of it, have only marginal effect on the jet reconstruction.
