## 1 Introduction

The measurement of the \(W\)-boson mass, \(m_{W}\), performed by the ATLAS Collaboration [1] has highlighted the challenges affecting measurements of \(W\)-boson production in the presence of additional inelastic \(pp\) collisions in the same bunch crossing. The average number of such additional collisions, referred to as pileup, was \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 9\) in the data set collected in 2011 and used for the measurement of \(m_{W}\). Later data sets have even larger pileup: the data collected in 2012 at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV have a value of \(\langle\mu\rangle\) of approximately 21, and the data collected in the years 2015, 2016, and 2017 at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV have values of \(\langle\mu\rangle\) of approximately 13, 25, and 38, respectively. The pileup degrades the measurement of the recoil, denoted \(u_{\mathrm{T}}\), which corresponds to the transverse momentum of the system of particles recoiling against the \(W\)-boson decay products. This degradation of the experimental resolution of the recoil measurement, which is at the level of \(\sigma(u_{\mathrm{T}})=13\) GeV in the ATLAS \(m_{W}\) measurement, is the main limiting factor in the accuracy with which the theoretical modelling of the \(W\)-boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) can be compared to data. Increased pileup also degrades the reconstruction of the missing transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and of the transverse mass \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\).1 Consequences for the measurement are reduced statistical sensitivity, larger systematic uncertainties due to the modelling of \(W\)-boson production, and enhanced multijet backgrounds. All these aspects are limiting factors in the perspective of a measurement of \(m_{W}\) with total uncertainty below 10 MeV, as required to match the 8 MeV uncertainty in the indirect prediction of \(m_{W}\) from global fits of the electroweak observables [2].

Footnote 1: The \(W\)-boson transverse mass, \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\), is derived from \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and from the transverse momentum of the charged lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) (\(\ell=e,\mu\)) as \(m_{\mathrm{T}}=\sqrt{2p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}(1- \cos\Delta\phi)}\), where \(\Delta\phi\) is the azimuthal opening angle between the charged lepton and the missing transverse momentum.

These limitations can be mitigated with the help of a sample collected in low pileup conditions. Such a sample would allow precise measurements of the \(W\)-boson production properties, which are difficult to model with the required accuracy, such as the transverse momentum distribution, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\), and the underlying event. These data would provide a means to reduce the uncertainties mentioned above, and the potential to replace the theoretical extrapolation of \(Z\)-boson measurements to \(W\)-boson modelling by direct measurements of the relevant \(W\)-boson distributions. This note discusses the prospect for a measurement of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) from a low pileup sample of approximately 300 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity collected at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, and corresponding to \(3\times 10^{6}\) selected \(W\to\ell\nu\) events, where \(\ell=e,\mu\).

Previous measurements of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) in low pileup conditions were performed by the ATLAS Collaboration at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV with 31 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity [3], and by the CMS Collaboration at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV with 18 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity [4]. These measurements are limited by large statistical uncertainties due to the small number of collected \(W\)- and \(Z\)-boson events in the samples.

Precise measurements of underlying event properties can also be performed in jet, photon, and \(Z\)-boson production, constraining the corresponding uncertainties in physics measurements. Such measurements will have long-term applications given the large amount of data to be taken at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) and \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. The diffractive physics program, and especially the study of central exclusive production, also requires significant integrated luminosity given the moderate cross sections, and requires low pileup conditions to allow a clean identification of the signals. Other possible measurements include the study of photon and jet production at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), with favourable background conditions.

In November 2017, ATLAS collected 280 pb\({}^{-1}\) of low-pileup data at \(\sqrt{s}=5\) TeV, and 160 pb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, in each case with \(\langle\mu\rangle\) of approximately 2. The sample collected at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV already provides about half of the integrated luminosity considered in this study. The \(\sqrt{s}=5\) TeV sample providesan interesting additional opportunity to study the energy dependence of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution. The analysis of these data sets will consolidate the preliminary studies discussed in this note.

## 2 The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution and \(m_{W}\)

The modelling of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution used for the measurement of \(m_{W}\) has a relative uncertainty of approximately 2.5% in the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) region [1]. Predictions are based on the AZ tune of the Pythia8 parton shower [8], which was derived using an earlier measurement of the \(Z\)-boson transverse momentum distribution [9]. The main contributions to the modelling uncertainty are the experimental uncertainty in the measurement of the \(Z\)-boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution (typically 0.5%), and the theoretical uncertainty in the extrapolation from \(Z\)-boson to \(W\)-boson production (2.5%, as estimated using Pythia8 and illustrated in Figure 1(a)). The considered sources of theoretical uncertainties include the charm quark mass, and variations in the QCD factorisation scale and parton distribution functions (PDFs) used in the modelling of the parton shower. The total resulting uncertainty on the \(m_{W}\) measurement of Ref. [1], which corresponds to \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 9\) and which is dominated by a fit to the decay lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution, amounts to 6, as obtained by adding in quadrature the sources of uncertainty related to the AZ tune, charm quark mass and the parton shower (see Table 1).

Various theoretical uncertainties, such as the PDF uncertainties and the uncertainties in the angular coefficients, are expected to improve with the constraints from current and future precise measurements of Drell-Yan processes and by using higher order predictions. In contrast, the theoretical uncertainties in the extrapolation from \(Z\)-boson to \(W\)-boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions are difficult to assess in a rigorous way, and are currently limited by the inability of higher-order predictions to describe the data. As shown in Figure 1(b), state-of-the-art predictions of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}/\,p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) ratio based on transverse-momentum analytical resummation significantly differ from the Pythia8 prediction for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) smaller than 5-6. Measured distributions related to the \(W\)-boson recoil strongly disfavour such predictions [1].

\end{table}
Table 1: Systematic uncertainties due to QCD modelling in the \(m_{W}\) measurement based on 2011 data with \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 9\), as reported in Table 3 of Ref. [1]. Uncertainties are given for the different kinematic distributions and \(W\)-boson charges. Except for the case of PDFs, the same uncertainties apply to \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\). The fixed-order PDF uncertainty given for the separate \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) final states corresponds to the quadrature sum of the CT10nnlo [5] uncertainty variations; the charge-combined uncertainty also contains a 3.8 contribution from comparing CT10nnlo to CT14 [6] and MMHT2014 [7].

A precise measurement of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution in low-pileup events will provide a direct comparison with QCD predictions, and should help to untangle the mechanisms responsible for the differences between \(Z\)-boson and \(W\)-boson transverse-momentum distributions. One specific such difference related to the influence of heavy-flavour initial state partons has been studied previously [10; 11].

Replacing the theoretical extrapolation from \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) by such a direct measurement of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution will be very beneficial for the measurement of \(m_{W}\). Measuring this distribution over the range \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}<30\) GeV with an uncertainty of about 1% in bins of size at most 5 GeV will reduce by approximately a factor of two the related QCD modelling uncertainty in the measurement of \(m_{W}\). Ideally, this precision should be achieved separately for \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) production, as the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distributions differ for the two processes. A measurement of the ratio of the \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions could be performed with good precision, thanks to the cancellation of most of the experimental systematic uncertainties, and should thus provide further constraints on the theoretical modelling.

## 3 Prospects for the measurement of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution

A measurement of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution with an uncertainty of 1% in bins of 5 GeV can only be achieved if the recoil resolution is comparable or better than 5 GeV. A significantly worse resolution would induce large bin-to-bin migrations and substantially reduce the statistical sensitivity of the measurement. A dedicated algorithm based on particle flow objects has been developed and used for these studies [12]. The particle flow algorithm removes calorimeter energy deposits due to charged hadrons in the inner tracker acceptance, instead using measurements of their momenta from the tracking system. The measurement of the recoil based on the particle flow algorithm shows improvements in resolution and pileup stability with respect to a measurement based only on calorimeter energy deposits.

The recoil resolution, \(\sigma(u_{\mathrm{T}})\) is estimated from the width of a Gaussian fit to the \(u_{\perp}\) distribution, which is the projection of \(u_{\mathrm{T}}\) on the plane perpendicular to the boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). In the absence of pileup, \(\sigma(u_{\mathrm{T}})\)

Figure 1: (a) Uncertainties in the extrapolation of the measured \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) distribution to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution, as derived using Pythia8 for the \(m_{W}\) measurement of Ref. [1]. (b) Comparison of the \(W/Z\) distribution ratio for Pythia8 and a set of resummed calculations [1].

strongly depends on the underlying event activity. The latter can be characterised by the scalar sum of the transverse energy of all reconstructed final state particles, excluding the \(W\)-boson decay products, and denoted \(\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\). As shown in Figure 2(a), in the absence of pileup, resolution values range approximately from 3 to 10 GeV as a function of \(\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\), with an average value of 5.5 GeV for \(\langle\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\rangle\sim 170\) GeV. The average value of \(\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\) increases with the amount of pileup, degrading the recoil resolution. The impact of the increasing pileup on the recoil resolution is illustrated in Figure 2(b), which also shows the influence of the calorimeter reconstruction settings. The optimisation of the energy thresholds used for the cluster reconstruction improves the recoil resolution by approximately 35%, compared to the settings used in standard high pileup reconstruction. Such an improvement was estimated in the absence of pileup, and applied for \(\langle\mu\rangle\leqslant 4\).

The expected statistical uncertainty on the measurement of the \(W\)-boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution is estimated using the methodology developed for the measurement of angular coefficients in \(Z\)-boson production [13]. In the context of measuring only the distribution of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\), the angular coefficients are fixed in the fit to NNLO QCD predictions, assuming modelling uncertainties of the order of a few percent. The events are categorised as a function of \(\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\), exploiting the better resolution expected for events with lower hadronic activity than average. The results of this study are summarised in Figure 3, which shows the evolution of the measurement precision as a function of \(\langle\mu\rangle\), when considering a sample of 300 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity of data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. Such a sample would provide about \(3\times 10^{6}\) selected \(W\)-boson events (1.8 and 1.2 \(10^{6}\) for \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) production respectively). The expected statistical uncertainty in the first bin of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution is approximately 0.4-0.6% when \(\langle\mu\rangle\leqslant 2\).

As shown in Figure 4, the recoil-calibration systematic uncertainties (denoted as "Response Matrix" in the Figure) amounted to approximately 2.5% at low pileup for the measurement of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution performed with data collected in 2010 at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV, and corresponding to 31 pb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity [3]. The uncertainty was dominated by the available \(Z\)-boson statistics. Scaling the integrated luminosity to 300 pb\({}^{-1}\) and accounting for the increase in \(Z\)-boson production cross section from \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV to \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, the calibration statistical uncertainty is expected to reduce to 0.6%. Including the impact of the various systematic uncertainties, the expected measurement precision is about 1% at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) for \(\langle\mu\rangle\leqslant 2\) (see Figure 3).

Figure 2: (a) The \(\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution and the corresponding recoil resolution as a function of \(\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\) for simulated \(Z\to\mu\mu\) events at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV without pileup. (b) Recoil resolution as a function of \(\langle\mu\rangle\) for simulated \(Z\to\mu\mu\) events with two different calorimeter settings.

Information from high pileup data can be used, in addition to the \(Z\)-boson \(in\ situ\) calibration, assuming that the \(\mu\)-dependence of the recoil calibration can be mapped precisely and extrapolated to \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 2\). This extrapolation requires a detailed study of the influence of the calorimeter readout settings, which are adjusted as a function of \(\langle\mu\rangle\) to optimise the cell-level energy measurement. Monte Carlo samples can be used to account and correct for the different cluster reconstruction thresholds used at high pileup and at \(\langle\mu\rangle=2\). The expected difference in resolution is in part due to the change in the assumed calorimeter noise, which can be monitored precisely as a function of \(\langle\mu\rangle\) in data. In addition, when lowering the clustering thresholds, low-\(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) clusters that are suppressed at high pileup become visible, and the amount and distribution of these clusters depends on the underlying event in \(W\)- and \(Z\)-boson production.

## 4 Recoil resolution at different collision energies

In the absence of pileup, two factors determine the dependence of the recoil resolution on the collision energy: the evolution of the underlying event activity, characterised by \(\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\), and the evolution of the energy containment, which can be defined as the fraction of the event energy emitted within \(|\eta|<4.9\), that is the acceptance of the ATLAS calorimeter system.

The behaviour of these quantities was studied using \(W^{+}\to\mu\nu\) events generated with Powheg+Pythia8[14] using the CT10nnlo PDF set [5], and simulated with ATLAS fast simulation [15]. Approximately \(10^{5}\) events were simulated without pileup at centre-of-mass energies of 2.76, 5, 7, 8 and 13. The particle-level \(\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions are shown in Figure 5. The underlying event activity increases with \(\sqrt{s}\) as expected. Figure 6(a), shows that the average value \(\langle\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\rangle\) increases proportionally to \(s^{1/4}\).

The evolution of the energy containment is shown in Figure 6(b). The calorimeters capture at least 90% of the total energy on average. Raising the collider energy from 5 to 13, the containment decreases by \(\sim\)4%, leading to a degradation of the recoil resolution of about 2% over this range. In comparison, the

The circles show the expected statistical uncertainty, in the square points the expected recoil calibration uncertainty is included.

The \(W\)-boson decay products are excluded in both cases.

degradation expected from the increase in event activity is about 15-20% over the same range. The effect of the containment is thus small compared to that of the increase in \(\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\).

The behaviour of the recoil resolution as a function of \(\sqrt{s}\) is studied using simulated event samples in Figure 7(a). The resolution is found to be \(\sigma_{u\mathrm{T}}\sim 5\) GeV at \(\sqrt{s}=7,8\) TeV, and increases with centre-of-mass energy as expected. Figure 7(b), shows the evolution of the \(W\)-boson production cross section. The behaviour is essentially linear above \(\sqrt{s}\sim 5\) TeV, and the increase in cross section between \(\sqrt{s}=5\) and 13 TeV is approximately a factor of 2.6.

For equal integrated luminosity, measurements of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution from data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=5\) and 13 TeV are expected to have comparable statistical uncertainties, since at higher centre-of-mass energy the increase in \(W\)-boson production cross section compensates for the deterioration of the recoil resolution.

## 5 Summary

A dedicated run at low pileup has a strong potential for \(W\)-boson measurements. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution could be measured with about 1% accuracy at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\), which represents an excellent opportunity for both QCD and electroweak physics. On the QCD side, the measurement will allow comparisons of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions of \(W^{+}\), \(W^{-}\) and \(Z\) bosons at the percent level, which will strongly constrain the theoretical modelling of these quantities and of their ratios, and will help in particular to understand the impact of heavy-flavour initiated process on weak boson production. An experimental determination of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) spectrum is also a fundamental input in the perspective of \(m_{W}\) measurements with total uncertainty below \(10\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{MeV}\). This program can be realised with a sample of \(3\times 10^{6}\) selected \(W\)-boson events, which corresponds to \(300\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity at \(\sqrt{s}=13\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{TeV}\), of which \(160\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) have been collected in November 2017.

The physics case of a low-pileup run is further enriched by a set of low- and medium-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) QCD measurements, including two-particle correlations, underlying event properties and diffractive scattering, and jet physics. These measurements have a strong potential to constrain some of the larger modelling uncertainties affecting many LHC analyses. While interesting in their own right, they will help reduce corresponding systematic uncertainties affecting measurements and searches performed in high pileup conditions.
