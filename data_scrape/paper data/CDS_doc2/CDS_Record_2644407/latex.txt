The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note describes expected ATLAS measurements of bulk and flow properties of dense nuclear matter measured in heavy-ion collisions (AA and pA) in LHC Runs 3 and 4. In particular projections for heavy flavor flow coefficients measured using muons, and flow decorrelation measured with charged particles are presented for Pb+Pb collisions. For \(p\)+Pb collisions projections Hanbury-Brown Twiss radii and forward-backward multiplicity correlations are shown. Multi-particle cumulants measured in \(pp\) collisions are also presented. The projections are made for a baseline of 10 nb\({}^{-1}\) of Pb+Pb collisions, as well as considering both 500 nb\({}^{-1}\) and 1 pb\({}^{-1}\) of \(p\)+Pb collisions, and 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) for \(pp\) collisions. The performance of the ATLAS Inner Tracker upgrade in heavy-ion collisions is also discussed.

## 1 Introduction

Among the key features of the quark gluon plasma (QGP) created in heavy-ion collisions are the collective properties of produced particles, in particular azimuthal anisotropy of particle emission. Sophisticated analyses of the azimuthal angle distributions of charged particles in Pb+Pb collisions are effective tools to study the QGP [1]. They have been found to be largely consistent with a hydrodynamic description of the produced matter, and are used as input to constrain and tune models of the collision system [2]. In addition, in studies of \(p\)+Pb collisions, which were initially assumed not to display any collective flow, similar properties to Pb+Pb collisions are observed [3, 4, 5]. Future measurements in \(p\)+Pb collisions are expected to shed light on the relationship between the collective properties observed in the \(p\)+Pb system and the QGP.

This note presents several quantities of interest in Pb+Pb and \(p\)+Pb collisions and demonstrates expected improvements to the measurements which can be made with the luminosity and detector upgrades in the upcoming LHC Runs 3 and 4. In particular, the increased acceptance of the Inner Tracker (ITk) will be beneficial for measurements of both soft and hard scale in heavy ion collisions, such as measurement of multi-particle correlations or production of forward jets. The projections are made for a baseline expected luminosity of 10 nb\({}^{-1}\) (5 nb\({}^{-1}\) each in Runs 3 and 4) of Pb+Pb data and two luminosity scenarios for \(p\)+Pb: 500 nb\({}^{-1}\) and 1000 nb\({}^{-1}\). Many of the considered analyses use triggers that do not sample the entire delivered luminosity (_e.g._ a minimum bias trigger), it is assumed that the fraction of the delivered luminosity sampled by the relevant triggers will remain the same as in existing analyses.

## 2 ATLAS detector and Inner Tracker upgrade

The ATLAS detector is described in detail in Ref. [6]. Significant upgrades to the ATLAS detector are expected to be installed for Run 4, in particular the ITk [7] will be of great importance to the discussed measurements. The primary benefit of the ITk for the measurements discussed in this note is the increased tracking acceptance of charged hadrons. The new tracking detector will have a pseudorapidity1, \(\eta\), coverage of 8 units, \(|\eta|<4\) (for comparison the present ATLAS Inner Detector covers \(|\eta|<2.5\)). The design and sensor layout of the ITk detector is described in Refs. [8] and [9]. The considered ITk layout is an all-silicon detector consisting of 5 pixel and 4 double-sided strip barrel layers. The end-cap system on each side consists of 6 strip discs arranged to provide optimal coverage and pixel disk arrangement in the forward direction covering the pseudorapidity range up to \(|\eta|=4.0\). The ITk is immersed in solenoidal magnetic field of 2 T to measure charged particle transverse momenta.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

Performance expectations for the ITk in \(pp\) collisions are detailed in [7] while in this section results for 5.02 TeV Pb+Pb collisions are presented. In order to study the performance of the ITk detector, a minimum bias (0-100% centrality) sample of \(10^{4}\) Pb+Pb Monte Carlo simulated events were generated using HIJING version 1.38b [10]. The generated sample is passed through a full simulation of the detector using Geant4 [11, 12], and the simulated events are reconstructed using the same software as in Ref. [7]. In this study the "Inclined duals" geometry layout is used, as described in Ref. [8]. The performance of the detector in simulated Pb+Pb collisions is found to be comparable to the performance in \(pp\) collisions.

The mean number of silicon clusters (hits) per reconstructed track with the transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.4\) GeV is shown in Figure 1 as a function of \(\eta\) for the pixel tracker, the strip tracker, and both together. The ITk provides at least 12 silicon hits for a track with \(|\eta|<4\). In the barrel region 8 strip clusters are expected on average, and 5 pixel clusters. In the end-cap regions, the number of clusters changes over the pseudorapidity range \(1<|\eta|<4\). A larger number of hits per track, up to \(\approx 21\), is observed in the transition region \(|\eta|\approx 2\).

The tracking efficiency is defined as a fraction of the number of reconstructed tracks matched to truth particles [7]. Figure 2 shows the efficiency to reconstruct tracks of charged particles, with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.4\) GeV, as a function of \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in minimum bias Pb+Pb collisions. A reconstruction efficiency of 70-90% averaged over \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is attained. The efficiency increases with transverse momentum from 65% at lowest-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to about 85% at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 1 GeV and 90% at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 10 GeV. The inefficiency is largely due to hadronic interactions in the detector material. Each reconstructed track is characterized by impact parameters, \(d_{0}\) and \(z_{0}\), where \(d_{0}\) is the distance of the point of closest approach to the beam axis and \(z_{0}\) is its \(z\) coordinate. The resolution of track impact parameters \(\sigma(d_{0})\) and \(\sigma(z_{0})\) as a function of pseudorapidity in minimum bias Pb+Pb collisions is shown in Figure 3. The impact parameter resolution of low-momentum particles, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\sim 0.4\) GeV, is dominated by the effects of multiple scattering. At \(|\eta|=0\), \(\sigma(d_{0})\approx 0.32\) mm and \(\sigma(z_{0})\approx 0.34\) mm and they increase with \(|\eta|\) due to the larger impact of multiple scattering for particles impinging the detector at steeper angles.

## 3 Projections

In the following sub-sections projections are made for several expected observables in Pb+Pb and \(p\)+Pb collisions. The projections presented in this note focus on improvements in statistical uncertainties and

detector acceptance. For the systematic uncertainties, some improvement is expected for the Runs 3 and 4 data based on advancement in measurement technique and improved understanding of the detector. However, at present, it is not possible to make a quantitative projection of these expectations for most of the analyses discussed in this note.

### Pb+Pb Measurements

#### 3.1.1 Heavy-flavor flow

Understanding the interactions of heavy quarks in the quark gluon plasma can help to understand transport properties of the plasma [13; 14]. ATLAS has performed measurements of the elliptic anisotropy of muons from heavy-flavor decays, \(v_{2}^{\rm HF\to\mu}\)[15], but these are of limited experimental precision. Figure 4 shows projections for the elliptic anisotropy of muons from heavy-flavor decays. The projections are made at \(\sqrt{s}=2.76\) TeV assuming an integrated luminosity of 10 nb\({}^{-1}\) and that the muon trigger with a 4 GeV threshold will sample the entire luminosity. The existing measurements [15] using Run 1 data

Figure 3: Resolution of track parameters \(d_{0}\) (left) and \(z_{0}\) (right) as a function of pseudorapidity for minimum track \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold 0.4 GeV in minimum bias (0–100% centrality) Pb+Pb collisions with the ITk upgrade.

corresponding to a luminosity of 0.14 nb\({}^{-1}\) are also shown. The central values of the projections are obtained by fitting the present measurements with an exponential function. The statistical uncertainties in the projections are made by scaling down the present uncertainties to correspond to the expected 10 nb\({}^{-1}\). The projections are also compared to calculations from the DABMod model [16]. Figures 5 and 6 show similar distributions for \(v_{3}^{\rm HF\to\mu}\) and \(v_{4}^{\rm HF\to\mu}\), respectively.

The projections are also compared to calculations from the DABMod model.

The projections are also compared to calculations from the DABMod model.

The present measurements are also shown for comparison. The error bars (shaded boxes) correspond to statistical uncertainties only. The projections are also compared to calculations from the DABMod model.

#### 3.1.2 Flow decorrelation

ATLAS has observed that the factorization of two-particle azimuthal correlations into single-particle flow harmonics is broken [17]. Repeating this measurement in Run 4 will lead to significant improvement due to a larger dataset and especially due to increased tracking acceptance in pseudorapidity with the presence of the ITk detector.

The amount of factorization breaking, or decorrelation, is quantified by constructing the correlator \(r_{n|n;1}\) for the first moment of the flow vectors defined as:

\[r_{n|n;1}(\eta)=\frac{\langle\mathbf{q}_{n}(-\eta)\mathbf{q}_{n}^{*}(\eta_{ \mathrm{ref}})\rangle}{\langle\mathbf{q}_{n}(\eta)\mathbf{q}_{n}^{*}(\eta_{ \mathrm{ref}})\rangle} \tag{1}\]

where \(\mathbf{q}_{n}\) is the normalized flow vector, and \(\eta_{\mathrm{ref}}\) is the reference pseudorapidity [17]. The correlator, \(r_{n|n;1}\), measures the relative difference between flow \(v_{n}e^{in\Phi_{n}}\) at different \(\eta\) and \(-\eta\). When flow is boost-invariant, \(r_{n|n;1}\) will always equal unity. However any difference in the \(\eta\) dependence of the flow magnitude \(v_{n}\) and the event plane angle \(\Phi_{n}\) would result in \(r_{n|n;1}\) smaller than 1. Here, the focus is on elliptic flow which corresponds to the \(n=2\) case. In Run 2, \(r_{2|2;1}\) was measured as a function of \(\eta\) for different event centrality classes and it was found that \(r_{2|2;1}\) differ significantly between central and peripheral collisions [17]. In particular, it was found that:

* \(r_{2|2;1}\) is much smaller in central collisions than in more peripheral collisions, which indicates stronger flow decorrelation.
* \(r_{2|2;1}\) decreases faster in the lower \(p_{T}\) region in central collisions than in mid-central collisions.
* \(r_{2|2;1}\) decreases along a parabolic curve in central collisions, while it decreases linearly in mid-central collisions.

The results show good precision for measurements of \(r_{2|2;1}\), where analysis is done in 5% centrality bins for minimum bias events, but is not viable for smaller centrality bins. By extrapolating from the luminosity used in the existing measurement, projections are made for Run 4 and shown in Figure 7 as dashed lines with color bands representing statistical uncertainties. The projections are made with a luminosity of 5 nb\({}^{-1}\) (estimated for Run 4 without Run 3). The reduced statistical uncertainty is smaller than the marker size. The ITk in Run 4 extends the \(\eta\) range to \(\pm\) 4 units, but the projected measurement is made to \(\pm\) 3.5 units, in order to leave a gap between the ITk and the region of the forward calorimeter in which the reference measurement is made (\(|\eta|=4.4-4.9\)).

### \(pp\) and \(p\)+Pb Measurements

#### 3.2.1 Azimuthal femtoscopy

The freeze-out dimensions of nuclear collisions can be measured with femtoscopy [18]. Knowledge of the wavefunction between pairs of outgoing particles can be leveraged to provide an image of the source, and the Bose-Einstein correlation between identical bosons provides particularly good resolution image of the source. Charged pions are most commonly used, as the final-state interaction between same-charge pion pairs is well-described by a Bose-Einstein correlation with a correction taking into account Coulomb force interactions. The effect of this interaction is an enhancement in the two-particle momentum-space correlation functions that have characteristic widths in momentum space inversely proportional to the length scales of the source function. The extracted length scales of the source are referred to as Hanbury Brown and Twiss (HBT) radii.

With azimuthally-sensitive femtoscopy, the spatial ellipticity of the source at freeze-out can be measured. This measurement can be used to test the prediction of hydrodynamics that an initial source ellipticity leads to increased transverse momentum along the minor axis of the transverse source ellipse. Results at the LHC for Pb+Pb collisions are observed to be consistent with the hydrodynamic expansion of a short-lived source [19]. A preliminary result by ATLAS finds this behavior in central \(p\)+Pb collisions as well [20]. The transverse HBT radius \(R_{\rm side}\), defined by the transverse direction perpendicular to outgoing particle pairs, provides the cleanest signal for detecting an elliptic modulation of the source. Such a signal would be an independent observation of hydrodynamic-like properties in \(p\)+Pb collisions. The normalized second-order Fourier component of \(R_{\rm side}\) as a function of flow vector magnitude, \(|\vec{q}_{2}|\), from the ATLAS preliminary result is shown in Figure 8. This figure also displays projected statistical uncertainties 1 pb\({}^{-1}\) of \(p\)+Pb collisions. These projected statistical uncertainties are obtained by scaling those from

Figure 7: Projection for the flow correlator as expected to be measured in Run 4. The left plot is for 0 - 5% centrality and the right plot for 20-30% centrality. The width of the projection bands indicates the expected statistical uncertainty.

the preliminary result. This improvement in data quantity would allow the measurement to indicate the dependence of the modulation strength on \(|\vec{q}_{2}|\), which is difficult to discern with the current data.

#### 3.2.2 Forward-backward multiplicity correlation

Forward-backward (FB) multiplicity correlations in the longitudinal direction are sensitive to early-time density fluctuations in \(\eta\). These density fluctuations generate long-range correlations (LRC) at the early stages of the collision, well before the onset of any collective behavior, and appear as correlations of the multiplicity densities of produced particles separated in \(\eta\). The event-by-event multiplicity density \(\rho(\eta)\) in pseudorapidity interval \([-Y,Y]\) is quantified in terms of Legendre polynomials \(P_{n}\):

\[\rho(\eta)\propto 1+\sum_{n}a_{n}T_{n}(\eta),\;T_{n}(\eta)\equiv\sqrt{\frac{2n +1}{3}}YP_{n}(\frac{\eta}{Y}) \tag{2}\]

where the coefficient \(a_{n}\) is measured through two-particle correlation function \(C(\eta_{1},\eta_{2})\):

\[\begin{split} C(\eta_{1},\eta_{2})&=\frac{\langle N (\eta_{1})N(\eta_{2})\rangle}{\langle N(\eta_{1})\rangle\langle N(\eta_{2}) \rangle}\\ &=1+\sum_{n,m=1}^{\infty}\langle a_{n}a_{m}\rangle T_{n}(\eta_{1 })T_{m}(\eta_{2})\end{split} \tag{3}\]

where \(N(\eta)\) is the multiplicity density distribution in a single event and \(\langle N(\eta)\rangle\) is the average distribution for a given event-multiplicity class [21].

Significant values are observed for \(a_{1}\) in all multiplicity ranges of \(p\)+Pb collisions and higher-order coefficients are consistent with zero [21], which implies the FB multiplicity correlation is dominated by the linear component of the Legendre polynomials (Eq. 2). However, several theoretical studies suggest

Figure 8: The second-order Fourier coefficient of the sideways HBT radius \(R_{\text{side}}\) as a function of flow vector magnitude \(|\vec{q}_{2}|\), normalized by the zeroth-order Fourier coefficient. The preliminary results from Ref. [20] are shown in the black points with statistical (bars) and systematic (shaded boxes) uncertainties, and projected statistical uncertainties from 1 pb\({}^{-1}\)of future \(p\)+Pb running are indicated by the red bars.

a non-linear component should exist in the region \(|\eta|>2.5\)[22, 23]. The increased tracking acceptance and increase in luminosity in Run 4 will provide a great opportunity to measure possible deviation beyond the linear component of the Legendre polynomials.

The top panel of Figure 9 shows the projection of \(C(\eta_{1},\eta_{2})\) distributions for same-charge pairs into one-dimensional \(\eta_{-}(\equiv\eta_{1}-\eta_{2})\) distributions over a narrow slice \(|\eta_{1}+\eta_{2}|<0.4\). The distributions are denoted by \(C^{\pm\pm}(\eta_{-})\). The red quadratic curve represents the linear component and the relative difference between \(C^{\pm\pm}(\eta_{-})\) and linear component is shown in the bottom panel. Short-range correlation contributes to the peak in the range \(|\eta_{-}|<1.0\), while in the long-range region, \(|\eta_{-}|>1.0\), \(C^{\pm\pm}(\eta_{-})\) is consistent with the linear component. To estimate the Run 4 projection, the magnitude of the first non-linear component, \(a_{2}\), is assumed to be 15% of \(a_{1}\). The statistical precision should be sufficient to quantitatively distinguish the possible non-linear component from the linear component. This projection suggests that Run 4 should bring a better understanding of the early-time density fluctuations in pseudorapidity.

#### 3.2.3 Multi-particle azimuthal correlation

The measurement of multi-particle azimuthal correlations has led to initial observations of collective-like effects in small systems [5, 24, 25]. In \(pp\) collisions at the LHC collective-like effects are of interest in two distinct regions: high-multiplicity collisions to compare to \(p\)+Pb and Pb+Pb collisions, and low-multiplicity collisions to search for the onset of these effects. Several performance estimates are presented here as examples for the rich physics which can be addressed with multi-particle azimuthal correlations in \(pp\) and \(p\)+Pb collisions.

State of the art measured 4-particle cumulants of \(v_{3}\) (\(c_{3}\{4\}\)) in \(pp\) and \(p\)+Pb collisions [25] are presented in Figure 10 overlaid with the projections for Runs 3 and 4. The increase in luminosity in Runs 3 and 4, assumed here to be 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) for \(pp\) collisions and 1000 nb\({}^{-1}\) for \(p\)+Pb (compared with 0.9 pb\({}^{-1}\) and 28

Figure 9: Projection of \(C(\eta_{1},\eta_{2})\) distributions for same-charge pairs (\(\pm\pm\)) into one-dimensional \(\eta_{-}(\equiv\eta_{1}-\eta_{2})\) distributions over a narrow slice \(|\eta_{1}+\eta_{2}|<0.4\). In the top panel, the grey band represents the measurement using Run 1 \(p\)+Pb data and the red curve represents the linear component. The projected Run 4 results are indicated by the blue circles. The relative difference between \(C^{\pm\pm}(\eta_{-})\) and linear component is shown in the bottom panel.

\(\text{nb}^{-1}\) in published \(pp\) and \(p\)+Pb measurements), provides a great opportunity to measure \(c_{3}\{4\}\) with high precision. In order to remove the non-flow contributions, the 3-subevent method is applied [26]. In \(pp\) collisions, with the data collected in Run 2, the statistical uncertainties are large and the \(c_{3}\{4\}\) values are consistent with zero in most of the \(N_{\text{ch}}\) range [25]. On the other hand, in large systems, significantly non-zero \(c_{3}\{4\}\) was measured, which reflects the nucleonic fluctuations in the initial state. If is of great interest to determine whether similar behavior is observed in small systems. With luminosity increased in \(pp\), the statistics will be sufficient to measure a signal down to \(v_{3}\{4\}=1.5\%\) for \(N_{\text{ch}}>170\), while 2% signals are accessible with large significance over a wide multiplicity range (\(N_{\text{ch}}\)>100). Similarly, in \(p\)+Pb collisions, the existing result shows that \(c_{3}\{4\}\) is consistent with zero [25], but increased statistics will help to detect a potential non-zero \(c_{3}\{4\}\) smaller than 1.5% for \(100<N_{\text{ch}}<500\). Similar projections for the case where the \(\eta\) acceptance is extended to 4.0 by using the ITk is shown in Figure 11 and the statistical significance further increases; it is possible to measure \(v_{3}\{4\}\) down to 1.5% even in the intermediate \(N_{\text{ch}}\) range.

Only statistical uncertainties are shown in the figure and the gray band represents the projected statistical uncertainty, with \(c_{3}\{4\}\) assumed to be zero. The red and green dash lines represent 1.5% and 2.0% \(v_{3}\{4\}\) signal separately. The vertical line in the left panel indicates the transition between prescaled high-multiplicity track triggered events and unprescaled ones.

## Summary

This note presents projections for several ATLAS measurements of the bulk properties of the medium created in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC in the upcoming Runs 3 and 4. A key part of future measurements is the installation of the ITk for Run 4, and its performance in the heavy-ion environment is discussed. The tracking performance results demonstrate the excellent potential of the ITk detector for the future LHC heavy ion physics program. Projections are made for flow decorrelation and heavy flavor elliptic flow measurements in Pb+Pb collisions, as well as forward-backward multiplicity correlations and Hanbury-Brown Twiss radii in \(p\)+Pb collisions. These projections are representative of many measurements which can be performed with the ATLAS detector with the high luminosity available in Runs 3 and 4 and are sensitive to the properties of the QGP.

The projections are estimated using particles from \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(|\eta|<4.0\). In order for the Figure to be comparable with Figure 10 the x-axis, \(N_{\rm ch}\), is defined with particles within \(|\eta|<2.5\). Only statistical uncertainties are shown in the figure, with \(c_{3}\{4\}\) assumed to be zero. The yellow, red and green dash lines represent 1.0%, 1.5% and 2.0% \(v_{3}\{4\}\) signals separately. The vertical line in the left panel indicates the transition between prescaled high-multiplicity track triggered events and unprescaled ones.
