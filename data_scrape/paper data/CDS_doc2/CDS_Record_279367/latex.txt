Observed asymmetries in B decays can be a combination of CP- or mixing-originated asymmetries, and intrinsic asymmetries from other sources. The real asymmetries are experimentally damped, 'diluted', by several 'dilution factors'. This note defines the fake asymmetries and dilution factors, estimates their magnitudes in the ATLAS experiment at LHC using simulations, and describes how and to which accuracy they can be experimentally controlled using the ATLAS data.

**1. Introduction**

Asymmetries in B decays can originate from physics processes such as CP-violation or B\({}^{0}\)-mixing. Asymmetries may also originate from a production asymmetry of B-hadrons, or they can be an instrumental effect due to the trigger features or reconstruction inefficiencies. An observed asymmetry is a combination of these effects. In order to measure a physical parameter such as a CP-violation parameter, or B\({}^{0}\)-mixing parameter, effects from other asymmetries have to be well understood.

The statistical significance of the measured asymmetry can be reduced, 'diluted', by several factors such as background, time-integration or fitting, and independent tagging of the B-flavour.

The measured time-integrated CP-asymmetry can be expressed as:

\[A^{\rm obs}\simeq D_{\rm tag}D_{\rm back}(D_{\rm int}\sin 2\phi+A^{\rm p}). \tag{1}\]

\(\phi\) is here the CP-violation parameter, and \(A^{\rm p}\) is the production asymmetry of B\({}^{0}\) and \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}\). \(D_{\rm tag}\) is the dilution factor from tagging, and \(D_{\rm back}\) is the dilution factor from background,defined as

\[D_{\rm back}=N_{\rm S}/N_{\rm total}, \tag{2}\]

where \(N_{\rm S}\) and \(N_{\rm total}\) are the number of signal events and the total number of events, respectively. The dilution factor \(D_{\rm int}\) due to time-integration over \({\rm B}^{0}\) decay times is

\[D_{\rm int}=(\sin\Delta mt_{0}+x\cos\Delta mt_{0})/(1+x^{2}), \tag{3}\]

where \(t_{0}\) is the start time of the integration, \(x=\Delta m/\Gamma\) is the \({\rm B}^{0}\) meson mixing parameter, \(\Delta m\) is the mass difference between the \({\rm B}^{0}\) meson mass-eigenstates, and \(\Gamma\) is the average width of the eigenstates. In case of a time dependent measurement, \(A^{\rm obs}=A^{\rm obs}(t)\), the dilution factor from time-integration should be replaced by a statistical factor \(D_{\rm acc}\).

## 2 Dilution from tagging

Studies which involve neutral B-meson decays in which both the \({\rm B}^{0}\) and the \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}\) meson decay into the same final state, like CP-violating channels \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\to{\rm J}/\psi{\rm K}^{0}_{\rm S}\), \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm d}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) and \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm s}\to{\rm J}/\psi\phi\), need an independent determination of whether the original decaying meson was a \({\rm B}^{0}\) or a \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}\). The same problem is encountered in the measurement of the \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm s}\) mixing, where one needs an independent tag to determine if the \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm s}\) was produced as a \({\rm B}^{0}_{\rm s}\) or as a \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}_{\rm s}\).

The independent determination of the meson B-quantum number, 'tagging', can be performed by defining the flavour of the accompanying B-hadron in the event. The tag can be the charge of the lepton, assuming that the lepton comes from the semileptonic decay of the other B, or the charge of the kaon, using the decay chain b-c-s. Other methods have been proposed as well, like jet charge tags, soft pion tags, and \(\Lambda\) or \({\rm K}^{*0}\) tags.

For ATLAS, a muon tag is the only feasible one due to the trigger requirements, except for \({\rm J}/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays, which can be tagged by other means - we have studied the electron tagging. Charged kaon tags are impossible for ATLAS due to the lack of charged hadron identification.

The statistical significance of the signal is reduced by wrong-sign tags as

\[D_{\rm tag}=1-2W, \tag{4}\]

where \(W\) is the fraction of wrong-sign tags over the total number of tags. Wrong sign muon tags can be caused by cascade decays of the b, \({\rm B}^{0}-\bar{\rm B}^{0}\) mixing, additional c- and b-quark pairs created in the parton shower, hadron background at low muon-\(p_{\rm T}\) (\(\pi\to\mu\nu\) and \({\rm K}\to\mu\nu\) decays, and punchthrough), and top decays. In case of electrons, hadron background is absent, but at very low electron-\(p_{\rm T}\) the tag rates are dominated by conversions and Dalitz decays.

Table 1 gives the wrong sign muon tag rates in \({\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) events. The results were obtained by samples simulated with the PYTHIA 5.7 program [1]3. The generation procedure was

to generate non-biased events (parameter MSEL=1), and to retain for further analysis those which contained a b-quark pair with transverse momenta above a threshold equal to the threshold required from the tag muon (electron). The B-decays were taken according to the standard decay tables in the simulation program. The Peterson fragmentation function was used for b and c-decays, with \(\varepsilon_{\rm b}=0.006\) and \(\varepsilon_{\rm c}=0.07\).

It can be seen that the wrong tag rate is constant with transverse momenta above 6 GeV/\(c\). The effective mixing factor varies slightly from sample to sample since it was estimated from the real number of neutral B-mesons in each sample. Although the total rate is constant above 6 GeV/\(c\), the composition of the sample changes as the transverse momentum threshold increases. The fraction of cascade decays decreases with \(p_{\rm T}\) in the studied range 3-15 GeV/\(c\). The fraction of muon from extra b-quark decays increases slightly, while the fractions of muons from extra c-quark decays and J/\(\psi\) decays stay relatively constant. The increase in the fraction of muons from W decays at high \(p_{\rm T}\) is due to top-quark decays, although in the generated samples the mass of the top-quark was set to 140 GeV/\(c^{2}\), which overestimates the top-quark cross-section.

Table 2 gives the wrong sign muon tag rates for muons originating from hadron decays. The overall muon rates from hadron decays were taken from [2]. Since it is assumed that there is another b-quark in the event which decays into a signal such as J/\(\psi\)K\({}_{\rm 5}^{0}\), the relevant mistag-rate from hadron decays is the probability that a hadron decays into a muon in a b-event. Therefore, the overall h\(\to\mu\) rate has to be multiplied by the probability to create a bb-event. The bb cross-section was taken as 500 \(\mu\)b and the total non-diffractive inelastic cross-section as 70 mb [3].

Tables 3 and 4 give the overall wrong sign muon tag rates for different \(p_{\rm T}\) thresholds of the muon. Including mixing, the total fraction of wrong-sign muons was estimated to be \((22\pm 1)\)% at \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold of 6 GeV/\(c\), which corresponds to a dilution factor \(D_{\rm tag}=0.56\). The wrong-tag rate was found to be the same for the two different muon rapidity coverages (pseudorapidity coverage \(\pm\) 2.2 corresponds to the complete muon trigger system, whereas \(\pm\) 1.6 corresponds to the barrel muon trigger system only).

In Fig. 1, the wrong-tag fraction is shown as a function of the transverse-momentum threshold of the trigger muon, including the different contributions.

The ATLAS detector has the possibility to use electrons as tags combined with J/\(\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays. The sources and fractions of wrong-tag electrons from decays in bb events are detailed in Table 5. The relative fractions of electrons from different sources were found to behave in a way similar to muons with respect to the \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold.

The fraction of wrong-tag electrons from conversions was estimated separately as follows. Conversions were assumed to be non-solvable from the data only if they occurred either in the beam-pipe or in the first layer of the vertex detector. Typical radiation lengths for the tracker were calculated assuming \(|\eta|\)= 1. The total radiation length of the tracker was taken as 50% \(X_{0}\), the beam-pipe was taken to represent 0.5% \(X_{0}\) and the vertex layer was conservatively assumed to represent 1.5% \(X_{0}\) (for \(|\eta|\)= 0, the strip-version of the vertex detector would correspond to 0.5% \(X_{0}\) and the pixel-version 1.0% \(X_{0}\)). In 50% \(X_{0}\), about one third of the photons produce pairs, and about 4% of these pairs are produced in the beam-pipe or in the vertex layer. The number of conversions is therefore \(N_{\rm conv}\simeq 1.33\cdot 10^{-2}N_{\gamma}\). The number of photons can be calculated from the number of Dalitz pairs as \(N_{\gamma}=2N_{\pi^{0}}=2(N_{\rm Dalitz}/0.012)\). Wrong-tag cross-sections can be thus cal culated by \(\sigma_{W}({\rm conv})=2.2\cdot\sigma_{W}({\rm Dalitz})\) since in both processes the probability to obtain a wrong-sign electron is 0.5.

Table 6 summarizes the wrong-tag rates including decays and conversions. The electron wrong-tag fraction is shown in Fig. 2. It was found that at \(p_{\rm T}\) values greater than 3 GeV/\(c\), the fraction of wrong-sign electrons was the same as for muons. For very low values of \(p_{\rm T}\), electrons from Dalitz decays and conversions dominate the single-electron rate. Above 3 GeV/\(c\), the fraction of electrons from Dalitz decays and conversions was found to stay relatively constant at the level of 1-1.5%.

In the studied \(p_{\rm T}\) range it should be possible to use the electromagnetic calorimeter and the preshower detector for electron identification, in addition to the transition radiation tracking. Finally, impact parameter cuts on the tag lepton could be used in the analysis if necessary.

## 3 Experimental control of asymmetries in B decays

Instrumental effects, such as charge-symmetry of the muon trigger, or symmetry of the lepton reconstruction efficiencies, has to be controllable from the data. This can be achieved by using for example \(\rm Z^{0}\), \(\Upsilon\), and \(\rm J/\psi\) decays into a pair of leptons. In addition, the possibility of using an electron-tagged sample gives ATLAS a way of controlling the experimental uncertainties related to muon tags.

The production asymmetry of \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) and \(\rm\tilde{B}^{0}_{d}\), which arises in proton-proton collisions, can be measured for example using tagged samples of \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*0}\) and \(\rm B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) once correction has been made for trigger biases. The production asymmetry has been estimated to be at the per-cent level in central pp-collisions at LHC [4]. The production asymmetry could also be measured independently by using non-tagged samples where the \(\rm J/\psi\) provides the trigger. The result in this case is insensitive to the possible biases for positively and negatively charged trigger muons, thus enabling one to cross-check the results on the production asymmetry obtained with tagged samples. By studying the subsample of events with tags, one has an additional control of the trigger biases.

The fraction of wrong-sign tags can be measured directly from the data using B decays such as \(\rm B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\). The measurement implicitly includes tags originating from all sources. Therefore, the measurement is dependent neither on the relative fractions of different types of B hadrons, nor on the fraction of cascade decays and multiple quark production. The electron and muon-tagged samples give a cross-check of the possible systematics related to the lepton flavour of the tag.

### Control of the production asymmetry

The decay mode \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*0}\) measures directly the asymmetry of \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) and \(\rm\tilde{B}^{0}_{d}\) at the production. The signal and background from \(\rm B\to J/\psi X\) were estimated using a sample of 77,426 \(\rm B\to J/\psi X\) events, normalized to 1.92 nb4. The sample was generated by using the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator [1]. The other B-hadron in the event was required to decay semileptonically into a muon (the trigger muon), and the other B-hadron was required to decay into a final state containing a \(\rm J/\psi\). The \(\rm J/\psi\) was forced to decay into a lepton pair. The event was accepted and written to tape if the trigger muon fulfilled the conditions \(p_{\rm T}>6\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<1.6\), and if the leptons from the \(\rm J/\psi\) decay satisfied the cuts \(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.5\). The number of signal events in the sample was 2,679, normalized separately to 40 pb (in the tapes, the relative branching fractions of the different B-hadrons to \(\rm J/\psi\) final states are approximate). The cross-section for the rest of the sample (background) was corrected accordingly. The particle momenta and impact parameters were smeared to take into account the detector resolution. The momentum resolution was taken as \(\sigma(p_{\rm T})/p_{\rm T}=5\cdot 10^{-4}\oplus 1.2\%\), and the impact parameter resolution was corresponding to the 'Panel' layout of the vertex detector [5].

Footnote 4: Tapes LH1126–38.

The decays \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*0}\) are triggered as for the channel \(\rm J/\psi K^{0}_{S}\). The same \(\rm J/\psi\) cuts were used as for the \(\rm sin\ 2\beta\) measurement [6] :

* Muon tagged \(\rm J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\): tag muon with \(p_{\rm T}>5\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.5\). Muons from \(\rm J/\psi\): \(\mu_{1}\) with \(p_{\rm T}>5\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.5\), \(\mu_{2}\) with \(p_{\rm T}>3\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.5\). In addition,one of the muons was required to satisfy the trigger conditions: \(p_{\rm T}>6\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.2\)5. Footnote 5: Here and in the following, the real pseudorapidity cut was 1.6 due to the stricter requirements on the pseudorapidity when the event was written on tape. After the cut \(|\eta|<1.6\), the number of events remaining was scaled by 2.2/1.6.
* Muon tagged \({\rm J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}}\): tag muon with \(p_{\rm T}>6\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.2\), since the tag muon should also fulfil the trigger requirements. Electrons from \({\rm J/\psi}\): \(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.5\).
* Electron tagged \({\rm J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\): tag electron with \(p_{\rm T}>5\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.5\). Muons from \({\rm J/\psi}\): \(\mu_{1}\) with \(p_{\rm T}>6\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.2\), \(\mu_{2}\) with \(p_{\rm T}>3\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.5\). The muon with higher transverse momentum satisfied the trigger.

Since the simulated sample actually contained only muon-tagged events, the number of events in the electron-tagged \({\rm J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) sample was estimated as a relative rate with respect to the muon-tagged \({\rm J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) sample, taken from [6].

In order to select lepton pairs coming from the same origin, the distance between the two leptons was required to be less than 100 \(\mu\)m. Pairs coming from the primary vertex could originate from a) b-decays with a short lifetime, b) if one of the leptons is a mis-identified hadron, c) for \({\rm J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}}\) Dalitz pairs, \(\eta\)-decays, d) Drell-Yan production and e) real \({\rm J/\psi}\)'s produced in directly in the hadronization. To reject background from primary pairs, the distance between the \({\rm J/\psi}\) decay vertex and the primary vertex in the transverse plane was required to be greater than 250 \(\mu\)m.

The fake \({\rm J/\psi}\) rate was estimated in [6]. The \({\rm J/\psi}\) mass width and efficiency were taken according to results obtained by using a full simulation [7]. For the decays \({\rm J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) a mass resolution of 30 (45) MeV/\(c^{2}\) was obtained for \({\rm J/\psi}\) rapidity range of \(|y|<0.8\) (\(|y|>0.8\)), with an efficiency of 88% for reconstruction within two standard deviations of the nominal mass. Here, an average mass cut of \(\pm 80\) MeV/\(c^{2}\) was used, corresponding to a mass cut of two standard deviations. The fake-\({\rm J/\psi}\) fraction was found to be about 45% in the \(\mu\)-tagged \({\rm J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) channel and 24% in the e-tagged \({\rm J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) channel, the difference coming from slightly different kinematical requirements in the two channels [6]. The efficiency was assumed to be 80% per lepton to account for other inefficiencies due to trigger and lepton identification. For the signal, an extra efficiency factor of 95% was used to take into account the effect of the two-standard-deviation mass cut.

For the decays \({\rm J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}}\) the average reconstruction efficiency was 76% using a mass window of [-400,+200] MeV/\(c^{2}\). The reconstruction algorithm was optimized for recovering from losses due to bremsstrahlung. The Gaussian component of the mass distribution was corresponding to a resolution of 75 (100) MeV/\(c^{2}\) for \({\rm J/\psi}\) rapidity range of \(|y|<0.8\) (\(|y|>0.8\)). In this analysis, the mass window used was [-400,+200] MeV/\(c^{2}\), assuming an efficiency of 80% per lepton. The fake-\({\rm J/\psi}\) fraction was about 95% in this window.

The K*0 was reconstructed by requiring a pair of oppositely-charged particles with \(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV/\(c\), \(|d|/\sigma_{d}>2\), and that the invariant mass of the pair was within \(\pm 50\) MeV/\(c^{2}\) of the nominal K*0 mass. A vertex fit was performed for both the \({\rm J/\psi}\) and the K*0 separately, and the distance between the two reconstructed vertices was required to be less than 200 \(\mu\)m. If the J/\(\psi\) and the K\({}^{*0}\) candidates passed all these cuts, the vertex fit was then performed for the four particles. The \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit was required to be less than 10, and the angle of the transverse momentum vector of the reconstructed B-meson and the line joining the primary and the secondary vertices in the transverse plane was required to be less than five degrees. Finally, a two-standard-deviation cut was applied to the B mass. The J/\(\psi\)K\({}^{*0}\) mass distribution is shown in Fig. 3.

For an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) the total number of events was 33,600, out of which 28,000 were signal events. This gives a statistical uncertainty on the production asymmetry of \(\Delta A^{\rm p}=0.007\). The detailed numbers of signal and background events are given in Table 7.

The decay mode \({\rm B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}}\) can also be used to control the production asymmetry of \({\rm B^{0}_{d}}\) and \({\rm\bar{B}^{0}_{d}}\) at LHC. Since the production asymmetry is less than one per-cent, the precision with which the production asymmetry of charged B-mesons can be extrapolated to apply to \({\rm B^{0}_{d}}\) mesons is sufficient. The decay mode \({\rm B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}}\), being a charged decay, has no CP violation due to mixing. Direct CP violation should not manifest itself here either, because the decay is dominated by a single decay diagram.

Using the selected sample of 102,150 events over a background of 6,550 events (see section 3.2), the statistical uncertainty on the production asymmetry is \(\Delta A^{\rm p}=0.003\).

The white histogram shows the signal, and the small hatched histogram shows the reflection from the charge-conjugated B when the K and the \(\pi\) are assigned wrongly, thus misclassifying the B. The dark histogram shows the background from other sources.

### 3.2 Control of wrong-sign tags

The fraction of wrong-sign tags can be measured directly from the data using B decays such as \(\mathrm{B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}}\). The signal was studied by using a sample of 2,428 \(\mathrm{B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}}\) events6, generated with the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator. The events were generated by requiring that if there was a \(\mathrm{B^{+}}\) in the event, it was forced to decay into a \(\mathrm{J/\psi K^{+}}\), and the \(\mathrm{J/\psi}\) was forced to decay into a lepton pair. The other B-hadron in the event was required to decay semileptonically into a muon (the trigger muon). The cuts for events written on tape were: the trigger muon was required to satisfy \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>6\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<1.6\), the leptons from the \(\mathrm{J/\psi}\) decay were required to satisfy \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.5\), and the charged kaon was required to satisfy \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.5\) GeV/\(c\), \(|\eta|<2.5\). The sample was normalized to 38 pb. The background from \(\mathrm{B\to J/\psi X}\) was estimated using the same sample of 77,426 \(\mathrm{B\to J/\psi X}\) events as in case of the \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*0}}\) analysis, and removing the signal events in the sample. The background from fake \(\mathrm{J/\psi}\)'s was estimated as described in section 3.1. The detector resolution and efficiency were accounted for in the same way as in the \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*0}}\) analysis.

Footnote 6: Tape LH1174.

The same cuts as in the \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{*0}}\) analysis were used for the \(\mathrm{J/\psi}\) and tag selection. The selected \(\mathrm{J/\psi}\)'s were then combined with each additional charged particle in the event. Cuts were applied to the \(\mathrm{K^{\pm}}\) candidate by requiring that the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(\mathrm{K^{\pm}}\) was greater than 1 GeV/\(c\), the kaon impact parameter scaled by its error \(|d|/\sigma_{\mathrm{d}}\) was greater than two and that the distance of closest approach of the kaon candidate to the \(\mathrm{J/\psi}\) vertex was less than 100 \(\mu\)m. The B meson was then reconstructed by using the \(\mathrm{J/\psi}\) mass constraint. Finally, the angle between the reconstructed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) vector of the B and the vector pointing from the primary vertex to the B decay vertex in the transverse plane was required to be less than one degree.

As shown in Fig. 4, there is a clean signal above the background. For an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and using events within two standard deviations of the nominal B mass, the total number of events was 113,530, out of which 108,150 were signal events. The size of the muon tagged sample was about 92,500 events with 89,400 signal events, and the electron tagged sample was about 21,100 events with 18,800 signal events. The sample compositions are detailed in Table 8.

Using the selected sample of muon-tagged \(\mathrm{J/\psi K^{\pm}}\) events, assuming \(W=0.22\) for the signal and for the background originating from B-decays, and \(W=0.5\) for the combinatorial background, \(\Delta D_{\mathrm{tag}}=2\Delta W=0.003\), and the relative systematic uncertainty is \(\Delta D_{\mathrm{tag}}/D_{\mathrm{tag}}=0.005\). The electron-tagged sample gave \(\Delta D_{\mathrm{tag}}=0.007\), \(\Delta D_{\mathrm{tag}}/D_{\mathrm{tag}}=0.013\).

With the \(\mathrm{J/\psi K^{\pm}}\) sample one can also control the symmetry of positively and negatively charged tags. Different values would modify the dilution factor as \(D_{\mathrm{tag}}=1-W^{+}-W^{-}\), where \(W^{+}\) (\(W^{-}\)) is the fraction of wrong-sign tags of the events which should be tagged as \(\mathrm{B^{+}}\) (\(\mathrm{B^{-}}\)).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline  & \(\mu\)-tag & \(\mu\)-tag & e-tag & All \\  & J/\(\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & J/\(\psi\)\(\rightarrow\) e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) & J/\(\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & \\ \hline N\({}_{\rm S}\) & 20,290 & 57,560 & 17,780 & 95,630 \\ \hline N\({}_{\rm B}\) & & & & \\ same B parent & 1,140 & 1,300 & 1,930 & 4,370 \\ combinatorial & 680 & 320 & 1,150 & 2,150 \\ \hline N\({}_{\rm tot}\) & 22,110 & 59,180 & 20,860 & 102,150 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Conclusions

This note dealt with fake asymmetries and dilution factors in B decays collected at the ATLAS experiment.

Dilution from tagging was considered in detail. The fraction of wrong sign tags was estimated to be \(W\)=22% at a \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold of 6 GeV/\(c\) for both muon and electron tags. The statistical accuracy of the estimate, due to the size of the simulated sample, was about 1%. The fraction of wrong-sign tag muons from hadron decays was found to be 0.17% (0.8% of the wrong-sign tag muon sample) at the nominal \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold. The fraction of wrong-sign tag electrons from conversions was estimated to be about 0.66% (3% of the wrong-sign tag electron sample). The systematic uncertainties of the estimated fractions of hadron decays or conversion electrons, however, may be large since the estimates were based on crude assumptions on the average material distribution in the detector.

The dilution factor from tagging was shown to be experimentally controllable with a relative accuracy of \(\Delta D_{\rm tag}/D_{\rm tag}\)=0.5% for the muon-tags and 1.3% for the electron tags using the decay channel \({\rm B^{+}}\rightarrow{\rm J}/\psi{\rm K^{+}}\).

The production asymmetry of \({\rm B^{0}_{d}}\) and \({\rm\bar{B}^{0}_{d}}\) mesons can be controlled by using the decay channel \({\rm B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow{\rm J}/\psi{\rm K^{-0}}\). The statistical error on the production asymmetry was found to be \(\Delta A^{p}\)=0.7%. A better accuracy can be obtained by using the decay channel \({\rm B^{+}}\rightarrow{\rm J}/\psi{\rm K^{+}}\), giving \(\Delta A^{p}\)=0.3%, but in this case the extrapolation from a charged B mesons to neutral B mesons might bring additional systematic uncertainties.
