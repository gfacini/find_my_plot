Constraints on an effective Lagrangian from the combined \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) and \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channels using 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV \(pp\) collision data collected with the ATLAS detector

###### Abstract

Six parameters of an effective field theory are constrained using the combined \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) channels, based on 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The parameters are sensitive to modifications of the Higgs boson couplings to strong and electroweak gauge bosons, and to the top quark. The most stringent constraints are those on the effective couplings to photons and to gluons.

_With respect to the original version, Table 2 has been corrected to remove the \(H\gamma\gamma\) vertex from the operators \(\mathcal{O}_{HB}\) and \(\mathcal{O}_{B}\)._

## 1 Introduction

Following the discovery of the Higgs boson [1; 2], the Standard Model (SM) description of Higgs boson couplings was tested by constraining the \(\kappa\) values that parameterize non-SM effects and are defined as multiplicative factors to the interaction terms in the SM Lagrangian. To extend the interpretation beyond this framework to more general Lagrangian operators, an effective field theory (EFT) framework has been constructed [3]. This framework allows broader tests of Higgs boson interactions and kinematics through a systematic probe of new perturbative physics at a high energy scale.

This note describes measurements of EFT parameters sensitive to Higgs boson production and decay. Fits to these parameters are performed using the full 2015-2016 \(H\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\gamma\gamma\)[4] and \(H\)\(\rightarrow\)\(ZZ^{*}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(4\ell\)[5] datasets that correspond to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\). Six parameters are chosen for the fit based on the expected sensitivity of the measurements. The parameters are related to the data through simplified template cross sections (STXS) based on Stage 1 of Ref. [3; 6].

The note is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the dataset and input measurements, Section 3 describes the fit parameters and their relationship to the simplified template cross sections, Section 4 discusses the statistical model, Section 5 presents the results, and Section 6 provides a summary.

## 2 Data and input measurements

The proton-proton collision data were collected by the ATLAS experiment [7; 8] in 2015 and 2016, with the LHC operating at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\), of which 3.2 fb\({}^{-1}\) were collected in 2015 and the remainder in 2016, for both the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) analyses.

The analyses of the individual decay channels separate the measured events into exclusive kinematic and topological categories, as summarized in Table 1[9]. The category selection separates individual production modes and their kinematic properties based on SM predictions, in some cases aided by boosted decision trees (BDTs). In categories with BDTs, the full binned output is utilized. The categories are designed to measure the simplified template cross sections, defined in Refs. [3; 6] and illustrated in Figure 1, using the SM kinematics of each STXS region as a template. The target STXS regions include gluon-fusion production in bins of jet multiplicity and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{H}\), and in two bins with VBF-like kinematics defined by the presence of two jets with large dijet mass. Quark-initiated production processes \(qq\to Hqq\) are split into a bin with a high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet, two VBF-like bins, a bin with two jets consistent with \(V(\to q\bar{q})H\) production, and a bin for the remaining events. Finally, leptonic decays of the vector boson in \(VH\) production are split into \(H\ell\nu\) and \(H\ell\ell\) final states, and further split by the Higgs-boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

Details of the experimental analyses are given in Refs. [4] and [5].

## 3 Effective Lagrangian parameters

Effective field theories can be used to describe new short-distance physics not included in the Standard Model. Taking the leading terms in an expansion in inverse distance (or equivalently, energy), the first terms that conserve baryon and lepton number have coefficients that are quadratic in distance (makingthe corresponding field operators dimension-6 in energy). The general form of the Lagrangian including dimension-6 operators is [3]:

\[\mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}+\sum_{i}c_{i}^{(6)}\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(6)}/ \Lambda^{2}, \tag{1}\]

where \(\Lambda\) is the energy scale of new processes; in the following the parameters are simplified to \(\bar{c}_{i}=c_{i}^{(6)}/\Lambda^{2}\). Several bases of these operators are available for gauge-invariant products of SM fields; of these, the strongly-interacting light Higgs (SILH) [10] and Warsaw [11] bases have the most complete public implementations. The fit described here focusses on the dominant operator coefficients in the SILH basis, based on leading-order predictions and taking into account precision electroweak constraints [12].

There are 59 operators in the dimension-6 basis assuming flavour-universal couplings, with an additional seventeen operators for the hermitian conjugates. The majority of these operators do not affect Higgs physics or have coefficients that are tightly constrained by precision electroweak data at leading order. Constraints on the coefficients of operators of the SILH implementation in Madgraph (the Higgs Effective Lagrangian, or HEL [13]) have been tabulated in an LHC Higgs working group document [14]. Of the fifteen operators whose coefficients are constrained by Higgs boson interactions, four are CP-odd and are neglected because they do not enter any STXS observable at leading order in \(1/\Lambda^{2}\) and are degenerate with corresponding CP-even operators at \(1/\Lambda^{4}\). Other operators that do not directly affect the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to ZZ^{*}\) measurements are those that affect the Higgs boson self-couplings and the Yukawa couplings

of the Higgs boson to down-type quarks and leptons. Removing these operators reduces the set to eight; as a final reduction, the operator that primarily affects the Higgs field normalization is neglected, as it causes a global change in rates and is not well constrained given the current precision of the data.

The operator reduction described above results in an effective Lagrangian consisting of the SM Lagrangian supplemented by the operators listed in Table 2. The leading vertices produced by these operators are given in the table. The HEL implementation recasts the Wilson coefficients of Eq. (1) into the dimensionless parameters indicated in the table with monospace typing. In this framework the precision electroweak parameter \(S\) is given by \(S=\texttt{cWW}+\texttt{cB}\)[12]; given the strong experimental constraint on this parameter cWW + cB is assumed to be zero and the orthogonal combination cWW - cB is taken as a parameter in the study. The parameters considered in this note are therefore cG, cA, cu, cHW, cHB, and cWW - cB.

To determine the relationship between the STXS measurements and the EFT parameters, the cross section is separated into SM, SM-BSM interference, and BSM components:

\[\sigma=\sigma_{\text{SM}}+\sigma_{\text{int}}+\sigma_{\text{BSM}}.\]

The dependence of the cross section on the couplings can then be expressed as

\[\frac{\sigma}{\sigma_{\text{SM}}}=1+\sum_{i}A_{i}\bar{c}_{i}+\sum_{ij}B_{ij} \bar{c}_{i}\bar{c}_{j},\]

where \(\sigma_{\text{int}}/\sigma_{\text{SM}}=\sum_{i}A_{i}\bar{c}_{i}\) and \(\sigma_{\text{BSM}}/\sigma_{\text{SM}}=\sum_{ij}B_{ij}\bar{c}_{i}\bar{c}_{j}\). The \(\bar{c}_{i}\bar{c}_{j}\) term, which is suppressed by \(1/\Lambda^{4}\), is included because it is the leading term that does not depend on the SM amplitude (the dimension-8

operators suppressed by this factor are subleading interference terms). The inclusion of this term prevents negative cross sections and leads to a better fit of the data. An equivalent expression is used for the partial and total decay widths of the Higgs boson.

The \(A_{i}\) and \(B_{ij}\) coefficients have been calculated using a Madgraph leading-order generation of \(\sigma\) and \(\sigma_{SM}\) for each HEL parameter in each STXS bin, neglecting uncertainties, and documented in Ref. [14]. The fit described here uses separate parameterizations for VBF and associated production with a vector boson, followed by the hadronic decays of the vector bosons. The small contributions from \(gg\to ZH\) and \(tH\) production are not explicitly calculated and therefore use the same EFT parameterizations as ggF, \(H\ell\ell\), or \(t\bar{t}H\). The relationship between EFT parameters and STXS regions is illustrated in Figure 2, which demonstrates the effect of the cA, cHW, cHB, and cWW - cB parameters on a set of STXS regions. These regions form a reduced set of the STXS regions used in the study and are obtained by merging all ggF regions, which are affected in the same way by the parameters, and by merging all \(VH\) categories with \(p_{T}^{V}>150\) GeV, since there is currently little sensitivity to these regions in the data. The value of each parameter in Figure 2 corresponds to the \(\approx+1\sigma\) expected value assuming the SM.

To perform the fit, the procedures of Refs. [4] and [5] are used to relate the yields in each data category to ratios of measured STXS values to those predicted by the SM. The SM predictions are modelled using the best available calculations and generators [9] and take into account the SM theoretical uncertainties (described in Section 4). The ratios are then expressed as quadratic functions of the HEL parameters using the Madgraph generation described above. The result is an effective parameterization of the data yields in terms of the HEL parameters.

The procedure potentially introduces a model dependence because of the assumption that each parameterization does not vary within its STXS region. Theoretical uncertainties covering such model dependence are not included. Higher-order effects introduce dependencies on additional EFT couplings, such as the top-quark loop in gluon fusion that causes an explicit cu dependence in the gluon-fusion regions. Higher-order QCD corrections can affect the momentum transfer distribution within a given STXS region, modifying the dependence on EFT couplings that are sensitive to this distribution (such as the EFT parameters sensitive to the \(HVV\) couplings). These effects are not evaluated here and the relations between the STXS and the HEL parameters do not account for such uncertainties.

## 4 Statistical model

The statistical treatment follows the procedures described in Refs. [9; 15; 16; 17; 18; 19; 20]. The six parameters of interest (POIs) are defined to be cG, cA, cu, cHW, cHB, and cWW - cB (see Table 2), and are fit simultaneously using a likelihood as described below.

For the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) channel, the number of events observed in each analysis bin is treated as an independent Poisson-distributed value. For the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) categories, the likelihood is given by a Poisson term multiplied by a likelihood binned in diphoton invariant mass for categories with more than 220 data events. In other \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) categories an unbinned likelihood is used. The full likelihood is given by the product of likelihoods for each channel and category.

Degrees of freedom related to the data-driven background estimations or the systematic uncertainties are included in the fit as nuisance parameters in the likelihood function. These parameters are constrained by data in the fit and in most cases include auxiliary constraints. Common nuisance parameters are used for shared sources of experimental uncertainty, such as the uncertainties on the integrated luminosity or the jet energy scale and resolution.

The sources of theoretical uncertainty on the SM cross sections of the STXS regions are missing higher-order perturbative corrections, uncertainties in the PDFs, uncertainty in \(\alpha_{S}\), and uncertainties in the modelling of the underlying event and parton shower (UE/PS). In relating measurement categories to STXS regions, migration uncertainties across ggF kinematic regions are accounted for using a generalized covariance matrix [4; 21]. These nuisance parameters and those associated with UE/PS uncertainties are correlated between the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) channels. Theoretical and parametric uncertainties on the decay branching fractions [3; 22; 23; 24; 25] are included, with correlations following the strategy of Ref. [15].

The result of the statistical combination is a likelihood function \(L(\mathbf{\alpha},\mathbf{\theta})\), where \(\mathbf{\alpha}\) represents the parameters of interest and \(\mathbf{\theta}\) the set of nuisance parameters. A statistical test of hypothetical \(\mathbf{\alpha}\) values is carried out

Figure 2: The values of modified STXS regions, relative to the SM, for \(\approx+1\sigma\) expected SM values of cG (\(3\times 10^{-5}\)), cA (\(3\times 10^{-4}\)), cu (\(0.25\)), cWW - cB (\(0.06\)), cHW (\(0.04\)), and cHB (\(0.15\)). The STXS regions have been modified by merging all ggF regions, which are affected in the same way by all parameters, and by merging \(VH\) categories with \(p_{T}^{V}>150\) GeV (“high \(p_{T}^{W}\)” and “high \(p_{T}^{Z}\)”).

using the profile likelihood ratio,

\[\lambda(\mathbf{\alpha})=\frac{L(\mathbf{\alpha},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}(\mathbf{\alpha}))}{L(\hat{ \mathbf{\alpha}},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}})}. \tag{2}\]

In the numerator, the nuisance parameters are set to the values \(\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}(\mathbf{\alpha})\) that maximize the likelihood function for a given set of values of the parameters of interest \(\mathbf{\alpha}\). In the denominator, both the parameters of interest and the nuisance parameters are set to the values \(\hat{\mathbf{\alpha}}\) and \(\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\), respectively, that maximize the likelihood function. Asymptotically, \(-2\ln\lambda(\mathbf{\alpha})\) is distributed as a \(\chi^{2}\) distribution with \(n\) degrees of freedom, where \(n\) is the dimensionality of the vector \(\mathbf{\alpha}\). The results are based on likelihood evaluations and give 68% confidence level (C.L.) intervals assuming the asymptotic approximation [26].

The compatibility with the Standard Model is quantified using the \(p\)-value, defined as the probability to obtain a value of the test statistic that is at least as high as the observed value. It is obtained from the value of \(-2\ln\lambda(\mathbf{\alpha}=\mathbf{\alpha}_{\text{SM}})\) assuming an asymptotic \(\chi^{2}\) distribution with a number of degrees of freedom equal to the number of parameters of interest [26].

## 5 Results

The results of the fit are shown in Figure 3 and Table 3 for the data and for an Asimov dataset [26] generated under the SM hypothesis. The correlations and likelihood scans are shown in Figures 4 and 5, respectively. The quadratic dependence of each STXS region on the EFT parameters leads to degenerate solutions in general; when these are well separated we focus on the solution that is most consistent with the SM (i.e. the value of the EFT parameter closest to zero). The p-value representing the consistency of the 6-parameter with respect to the SM expectation is 47%.

The central values of the parameters are consistent with the patterns observed in the STXS measurements [9]: the ratio of branching fractions \(\mathcal{B}(H\to\gamma\gamma)/\mathcal{B}(H\to 4\ell)\) is measured to be below that of the SM, leading to a positive cA since \(\mathcal{B}(H\to\gamma\gamma)/\mathcal{B}_{SM}(H\to\gamma\gamma)-1\propto-\texttt {cA}\) to first order in the coefficients; the measured VBF cross section is above that of the SM, leading to positive cWW and negative cHW, since \(\sigma(\text{VBF})/\sigma_{SM}(\text{VBF})-1\approx\texttt{cWW}-4\texttt{cHW}\); and the measured \(t\bar{t}H\) cross section is below that of the SM, leading to negative cu since \(\sigma(t\bar{t}H)/\sigma_{SM}(t\bar{t}H)-1\propto\text{cu to first order}\).

Compared to the SM expectation, the sensitivity to the dimension-6 \(HVV\) couplings (cHW, cHB, cWW - cB) is higher because the measured VBF cross-section is higher than (though still compatible with) the SM prediction [9]. This also leads to a positive correlation between cHB and cWW - cB, and a more negative correlation between cHB and cHW than expected in the SM. There is a large anti-correlation between cWW - cB and cHW from the \(VH\) categories, where the corresponding \(A_{i}\) coefficients are large and enter with the same sign [14]. For the \(t\bar{t}H\) coupling cu the observed sensitivity is lower than expected because the low observed yield [9] effectively removes the degeneracy and gives a flatter likelihood profile.

A previous global fit to data from the Tevatron and Run 1 of the LHC found similar constraints on these parameters [12]. The results presented here show improved sensitivity to cG and cA, as expected. The \(HVV\) couplings can be further constrained by including other VBF Higgs measurements and \(H\to WW\) decays. Tighter constraints on cu can be obtained by including measurements of \(t\bar{t}H\) production in other Higgs boson decay channels.

## 6 Summary

An initial fit has been performed for EFT parameters using combined ATLAS Higgs cross section measurements. The constraints on the parameters that describe interactions between the Higgs boson and either gluons or photons are stronger than those from a prior fit to a similar parameter set [12]. The six-parameter fit demonstrates a general procedure for moving beyond \(\kappa\) parameter fits into a more general EFT framework for combined Higgs boson measurements. As more measurements are included and more robust theoretical tools become available, the fits will expand to larger operator sets and will further exploit kinematic distributions to tighten the constraints on EFT parameters.
