# Searches for Supersymmetry at the high luminosity LHC with the ATLAS Detector

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Supersymmetry is one of the best motivated and well-studied extensions of the Standard Model. The current searches at the LHC have yielded sensitivity to TeV scale gluinos and \(1^{st}\), \(2^{nd}\) generation squarks, as well as to \(3^{rd}\) generation squarks and weak gauginos in the hundreds of \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) mass range. The reach at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC is expected to significantly extend beyond the current limits. Selected searches based on an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) and performed with the ATLAS detector are presented in this document.

Introduction

The Standard Model (SM) of particles and fields describes a variety of experimental data over a large energy range and many of its predictions have been succesfully tested at the per mille level. The SM can however be considered a low energy effective theory as the scalar sector is unstable under radiative corrections.

Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] is an hypothetical new symmetry of Nature which relates fermions and bosons. It requires that for every boson (fermion) of the SM there exist a yet unseen fermionic (bosonic) partner. The SUSY particles represent the new degrees of freedom that cancel the quadratic divergences of the SM. SUSY also accommodates the unification of the gauge interactions, a radiative breaking of the electroweak symmetry, and represents an essential ingredient of superstring theories. Under the conservation of \(R\)-parity, \(P_{R}=(-1)^{2s+3B+L}\), SUSY predicts the existence of a candidate for the dark matter in the Universe. Furthermore, the minimal supersymmetric model (MSSM) requires a Higgs boson with mass below \(\sim\)135 GeV which could be consistent with the recently observed Higgs-like resonance [10, 11]. The discovery (or exclusion) of weak-scale SUSY is reckoned among the highest physics priorities for the current and future LHC, including its high luminosity upgrade (HL-LHC (\(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV; 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

### The LHC and HL-LHC

In 2012, the LHC delivered 23.2 fb\({}^{-1}\) at a centre of mass-energy of 8 TeV. During the shutdown following the end of data taking (LS1) the machine will be consolidated to be able to operate at a centre-of-mass-energy close to the design value of 14 TeV. In the following data taking period, lasting till the end of 2017, the LHC will collect \(\sim\)100 fb\({}^{-1}\). A second long shutdown (LS2) will take place starting in 2018 during which the injection chain will be modified to allow for instantaneous luminosities up to \(\sim\)2\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The data collected from 2020 till 2022 will amount to \(\sim\)300 fb\({}^{-1}\). Around 2022, the accelerator chain will be further upgraded to achieve luminosities of \(\sim\)5\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) (LS3). The machine is expected to deliver \(\sim\)3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) by about 2030.

### Selected results from searches for \(R\)-parity conserving SUSY at the LHC

In the framework of generic \(R\)-parity conserving supersymmetric extensions of the SM, SUSY particles are produced in pairs and the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable. In a large fraction of the parameter space the LSP is the lightest neutralino, where neutralinos (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{j}\), \(j=1,2,3,4\)) and charginos (\(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{i}\), \(i=1,2\)) are the mass eigenstates originating from the superposition of the SUSY partners of Higgs and electroweak gauge bosons (higgsinos and gauginos). The scalar partners of right-handed and left-handed fermions can mix to form two mass eigenstates, nearly degenerate in the case of first and second generation squarks and sleptons (\(\tilde{q}\) and \(\tilde{l}\)), whilst possibly split in case of bottom and top squarks (sbottom, \(\tilde{b}\) and stop, \(\tilde{t}\)) and tau sleptons (stau, \(\tilde{\tau}\)). The lighter stop mass eigenstate can be significantly lighter than the other squarks and the gluinos (\(\tilde{g}\), supersymmetric partners of the gluons).

The searches in the initial phases of the LHC (in particular those corresponding to the 35 pb\({}^{-1}\) and the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) datasets) targetted processes with large expected cross-section, such as production of gluinos and 1\({}^{st}\), 2\({}^{nd}\) generation squarks (Fig. 1). As the integrated luminosity increased, the search strategy was refined to access processes with either smaller cross-section or a-priori smaller sensitivity. Nowadays, the ATLAS Collaboration is carrying out a broad programme of searches including searches for light-flavor squarks and gluinos, weakly produced sparticles, and third generation squarks.

Results from the searches mentioned above exclude 1\({}^{st}\) and 2\({}^{nd}\) generation squark and gluino masses below about 1.4 TeV and 1.0 TeV, respectively, under the assumption of a mass-less LSP [13]. Lessstringent limits are placed on third generation squarks [14], weak gauginos [15] and sleptons [16], where the mass constraints strongly depend on the assumed SUSY mass spectrum.

### Selected searches for \(R\)-parity conserving SUSY at the HL-LHC

In order to assess the sensitivity during the HL-LHC phase, three representative analyses are developed:

* search for gluinos and \(1^{st}\), \(2^{nd}\) generation squarks,
* search for direct production of top squarks (referred to as stop),
* search for direct production of weak gauginos,

under the assumptions of:

* 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 14 TeV (LHC)
* 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}\)= 14 TeV (HL-LHC).

For these initial studies, generator level information is used for both the background and the signal processes. Relevant quantities such as the lepton and jet transverse momentum and the missing transverse momentum are corrected to account for a realistic detector resolution as described in Ref. [17]. In particular, the correction accounts for the effect of the number of multiple interactions per bunch crossing ranging between 100 and 140 as expected with 25ns bunch crossing.

In the analysis, "truth" jets are considered as candidate jets if the transverse momentum is larger than 25 GeV. Candidate jets are identified as originating from \(b\)-quarks with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent efficiency as high as 70% for \(|\eta|<1.5\), and smaller at larger \(|\eta|\). The corresponding mis-identification probability of light-flavor quarks is of few percent. The identification efficiency of electrons with transverse energy larger than 20 GeV varies between 85% and 97% depending on the tighteness of the identification criteria. In the case of muons with transverse momentum larger than 7 GeV, the efficiency is 97%. Several triggers, including a single-lepton and an \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) trigger, are used for the SUSY searches. The triggers are optimized to have a physical rate within the allocated bandwidth. In case of the single muon (electron) trigger, the

Figure 1: Next-to-leading order cross-sections for the production of supersymmetric particles at the LHC as a function of the average mass of the pair-produce supersymmetric particles [12].

efficiency for muons (electrons) with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than 25 GeV is 88% (99%). In case of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) trigger, the efficiency for events with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) larger than 180 GeV is 100%. It is assumed that this trigger can be run un-prescaled.

Several Monte Carlo (MC) generators are used to model the dominant SM processes and new physics signals relevant for the analyses. SHERPA[18] is used to simulate the diboson \(W\!Z^{(*)}\), \(W^{(*)}\)+jets, and \(Z^{(*)}\)+jets processes. PYTHIA[19] is used to generate the \(WW^{(*)}\) events. MC@NLO[20] is chosen for the simulation of single- and pair-production of top quarks. Additional dedicated samples for pair-production of top quarks are generated with SHERPA. The expected diboson yields are normalised using next-to-leading-order (NLO) QCD predictions obtained with MCFM[21, 22]. The top-quark pair-production contribution is normalised to approximate next-to-next-to-leading-order calculations (NNLO) [23]. The NNLO FEWZ[24, 25] cross-sections are used for normalisation of the inclusive \(W\)+light-flavour jets and \(Z\)+light-flavour jets. The CTEQ6L1[26] parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used with MadGraph and the CT10[27] PDFs with MC@NLO and SHERPA.

### Expected sensitivity

For the analyses discussed in this document, limits are set using a significance-like variable, referred to as \(Zn\)[28], which takes into account the systematic uncertainties. The value of \(Zn\) is required to be larger than 5 for discovery and larger than 1.641 for exclusion, if not stated otherwise.

Footnote 1: One sided confidence interval.

The most important sources of experimental systematic uncertainties are due to the limited energy resolution of jets, leptons and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\); pile-up, and trigger efficiency. Coarse systematic uncertainties of 30% on the background estimates are assumed, which are consistent with the uncertainties found in published searches. To assess the impact of this assumption, the uncertainties are lowered to 20% in the case of the weak gaugino search. Under this assumption the search achieves a 2% gain in mass reach. Theoretical uncertainties on the SM and SUSY yields due to the choice of renormalization and factorization scales and PDF are not considered in this study.

## 2 Search for squarks and gluinos

The search for the production of gluinos and light-flavor squarks is carried out in final states with several jets and large missing transverse momentum. The model used for the search optimisation and for the interpretation of the results is a simplified SUGRA model with a highly degenerate SUSY mass spectrum as shown in Fig. 2(a) for a benchmark point. The LSP is the lightest neutralino and is here considered to be massless. The study is performed in terms of the masses of the gluinos and the first- and second-generation squarks. The conclusions drawn from this simplification can be extended to other heavy squark and gluino models where \(m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\ll m_{\tilde{q},\tilde{\jmath}}\).

A total of 120 points with masses between 1000 GeV and 4000 GeV for squarks and gluinos respectively is generated with Herwig++[29]. The cross-sections are calculated to next-to-leading order using Prospino 2.1[30]. The two benchmark points used as reference in the figures are:

* \(m_{\tilde{q}}=m_{\tilde{\phi}}=3200\) GeV and
* \(m_{\tilde{q}}=2800\) GeV \(m_{\tilde{\phi}}=2400\) GeV.

### Object pre-selection

The object pre-selection is performed according to the recommendations described in Section 1. In addition, the following kinematic conditions are required:* electrons and muons must have at least \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.5\)
* jets must have at least \(p_{\rm T}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.5\). The \(b\)-tagged jets, used for a parallel study of kinematic properties in case of discovery, are in addition required to have \(p_{\rm T}>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\).

For the version of this study presented in Ref. [32], no \(\eta\) requirements were made.

### Signal region optimisation

For this search the signal region is based on the optimisation studies described in Ref. [33]. In particular, the observables utilized in the search are \(H_{\mathrm{T}}\)  defined as:

\[H_{\mathrm{T}}=\sum_{p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\mathrm{GeV}}^{\mathrm{jets}}|p_{\mathrm{T }}|. \tag{1}\]

and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) significance calculated as \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/\sqrt{H_{\mathrm{T}}}\). The signal region is then defined as follows:

* by vetoing events with electrons and muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV. It is assumed that the lepton veto efficiency will not be significantly deteriorated despite the more challenging environment thanks to the pertinent hardware and detector upgrades.
* by requesting at least 4 jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>60\) GeV. This cut is set to characterise the final state originating from cascade decays of supersymmetric particles;
* by requesting \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/\sqrt{H_{\mathrm{T}}}>15\) GeV\({}^{1/2}\). The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/\sqrt{H_{\mathrm{T}}}\) variable discriminates events with real missing momentum from multi-jet events for which the main source of missing momentum is due to jet mismeasurement. In the ATLAS search for events with high jet multiplicities and no leptons [34], the multi-jet background is seen to lie at \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/\sqrt{H_{\mathrm{T}}}<4\) GeV\({}^{1/2}\). This is also the region where the majority of the other secondary backgrounds lie, although these peak at slightly higher values. A cut in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/\sqrt{H_{\mathrm{T}}}>15\) GeV\({}^{1/2}\) eliminates the \(Z\rightarrow\nu\nu\) peak and is therefore expected to reject most of the multijet background (Figure 3(a)).

The variable used as a discriminant is \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\), defined as

\[M_{\mathrm{eff}}=E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+H_{\mathrm{T}}. \tag{2}\]

and shown in Figure 3(b).

The high \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\)  cut, combined with the cut in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/\sqrt{H_{\mathrm{T}}}\)  and the minimum jet multiplicity requirement, result in an implicit cut in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) at \(\sim 700\) GeV and in the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) at \(\sim 500\) GeV. These \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and jet-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirements are expected to be stringent enough to avoid significant trigger bias from jet-\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) triggers.

Figure 4(a) shows the signal yield, scaled to cross-section and integrated luminosity, and Figure 4(b) shows the signal acceptance of the signal region.

### Expected Sensitivity

Figure 5(a) shows the expected limits and discovery potential achievable for \(\tilde{q}\) and \(\tilde{g}\) in the simplified model with a massless LSP. An increase of integrated luminosity from 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) allows to extend both the exclusion limit and the discovery contour by \(\sim\)400 GeV.

The exclusion limit shown in Ref. [32] uses \(S/\sqrt{B}\) as the significance variable. In that case, it was required that \(S/\sqrt{B}>5\) for discovery and \(S/\sqrt{B}>1.96\)2 for exclusion.

### Search for Higgs bosons in squark-gluino cascade decays

If large deviations are observed with respect to the SM background estimates, the kinematics of the events can be studied in detail and decay products in the SUSY particles decay chain be identified. In particular, it is interesting to look for light Higgs bosons produced in SUSY cascades in the decay of a chargino or a neutralino into a lighter chargino or neutralino, respectively. This case has been studied using a benchmark point with \(m_{\tilde{\chi},\tilde{\phi}}\sim 2\) TeV and \(m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\sim 390\) GeV.

The analysis strategy is similar to the one used for the previous study of the discoverability of heavy

squarks and gluinos, but adjusted to this particular search:

* No electrons or muons with \(p_{\rm T}>20\) GeV.
* At least 4 jets with \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>60\) GeV.
* At least 2 \(b\)-jets with \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5.
* \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}/\sqrt{H_{\rm T}}>10\).
* \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)\(>500\) GeV.
* \(H_{\rm T}\)\(>2000\) GeV.

For each event, all the possible combinations of \(b\)-jet pairs are taken and their invariant mass considered with a weight of \(1/n_{\rm pairs}\). The excess of events at around 125 GeV has a local \(S/\sqrt{B}\) of approximately 9 for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), whereas for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) the significance drops below the discoverability threshold.

Search for direct production of top squarks

### Physics Motivation

Naturalness arguments ([35, 36]) require the light top squark mass eigenstate to be significantly below 1 TeV, which now appears to be significantly lighter than the other squarks.

At \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) the direct stop pair production cross-section, calculated to NLO in the strong coupling constant, including the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy (NLO+NLL), is shown in Fig. 6. For 600 GeV stop mass it is 240 fb and it decreases to 10 fb for \(\mathrm{m}_{\tilde{t}}=1\,\mathrm{TeV}\).

Stops can decay in a variety of modes which are very much dependent on the parameters of the SUSY model assumed. Typically, SUSY final state events contain top or \(b\)-quarks, \(W/Z\) or Higgs bosons, and an LSP. Pair production signatures are thus characterised by the presence of several jets, including \(b\)-jets, large missing transverse momentum and possibly leptons. In some cases (e.g. the loop-dominated \(\tilde{t}\to c+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) decay in the very compressed scenario, or if the stop mass is close to the mass of the electroweak gauginos) the dominant decay chains will be difficult to separate from the SM background and dedicated analyses -- not subject of this document -- must be employed.

### Description of the models

Two models among the possible scenarios are considered in this study.

First, the pair-produced stops are assumed to decay to a top quark and the LSP (\(\tilde{t}\to t+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\)) with 100% BR, requiring that \(m(\tilde{t})-m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0})>m(t)\). The final state for such a signal is characterized by a top quark pair produced in association with large missing transverse momentum from the undetected LSPs. A signal grid is generated with a step size of 50 or 100 GeV both for the stop and LSP mass values.

The second model assumes BR=100% for stop decaying via \(b+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\), with subsequent decay of the charginos as \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\to W^{\pm}+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\). This decay mode of the stop requires that \(m(\tilde{t})-m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm})>m(b)\). A signal

Figure 6: Direct stop pair production cross-section at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) calculated to NLO in the strong coupling constant, including the resummation of soft gluon emission at next-to-leading-logarithmic accuracy (NLO+NLL) [37]

grid is generated with a step size of 50 or 100 GeV for the stop and LSP mass values. Assuming that \(m(\tilde{t})-m(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm})\)=20 GeV the final state events contains two soft \(b\)-jets, two \(W\) bosons, real or virtual, and two invisible particles.

### Event Selection

Two studies are carried out as counting experiments targeting the scenarios described above. A one-lepton-based selection (\(\ell\in\{e,\mu\}\)) with stringent requirements on missing transverse momentum is employed to search for \(\tilde{t}\to t+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\). A two-lepton-based selection (\(e\mu\) only) is used for scenarios with \(\tilde{t}\to b+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\). In both cases signal electrons and muons are required to have \(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5 to fulfill minimum trigger requirements. Jets (including \(b\)-jets) must have \(p_{\rm T}>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5.

#### 3.3.1 1-lepton channel optimization

The strategy employed to search for \(\tilde{t}\to t+\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) follows closely the one adopted in Ref. [14]. In the present study, at least 4 jets with \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>120,100,50\) and 50 GeV respectively are initially selected, and at least one has to be identified as a \(b\)-jet. Three key-observables are used to define the signal regions and suppress otherwise dominant SM background contributions:

* the missing transverse momentum, \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\);
* the transverse mass variable, \(m_{\rm T}=\sqrt{2\times p_{\rm T,\ell}\times(1-cos(\Delta\phi)}\) where \(\Delta\phi\) is the angular separation of the lepton and the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\).
* the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}/\sqrt{H_{\rm T}}\) variable, where \(H_{\rm T}=p_{\rm T}^{\ell}+\sum_{p_{\rm T}>40\rm GeV}^{\rm jets}|\mathbf{ p_{\rm T}}|\);

Pre-selection requirements are placed on \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)(\(>\)225 GeV) and \(m_{\rm T}\) (\(>\)140 GeV), which reduce to a negligible level contributions from the \(W\)+jets background. The remaining SM background mostly arises from top pair-production (fully-leptonic and, to a lesser extent, semi-leptonic), with non negligible contributions from \(\tilde{t}t+W\)/\(Z^{(*)}\) processes 3.

Footnote 3: Due to a lack of 14 TeV samples, the relative contributions of these processes have been extrapolated from the results of the present searches after rescaling to the appropriate cross-section.

An optimisation is performed for each signal point in order to optimize the sensitivity for different stop and LSP masses. For each scenario, the combination of requirements on leading and sub-leading jet \(p_{\rm T}\), \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}/\sqrt{H_{\rm T}}\) and \(m_{\rm T}\) leading to the highest significance is chosen. In particular the requirement on \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) varies between 300 and 600 GeV the one on \(m_{\rm T}\) between 160 and 340 GeV, whilst \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}/\sqrt{H_{\rm T}}\) thresholds of 15, 20 and 25 GeV\({}^{1/2}\) have been considered. As expected, the tightest signal regions have the best sensitivity for high stop mass scenarios, while medium selections are chosen for intermediate stop mass scenarios. For compressed scenarios (small \(\Delta m\) between stop and neutralino masses), the sensitivity depends on the good knowledge of the shape of the kinematic variables in \(\tilde{t}\tilde{t}\) events, as well as on the systematic uncertainties on the theoretical predictions. In this study, the impact of such uncertainties is assumed to be negligible.

#### 3.3.2 2-lepton channel optimization

Events which contain exactly two leptons are selected if at least one lepton satisfies the leading \(p_{T}\) requirement of \(p_{T}>25\) GeV. Only the \(e\mu\) selection is considered such that contributions from \(Z^{(*)}\)+jets backgrounds are negligible.

The dilepton \(m_{\rm T2}\)[38, 39] variable is taken as the main discriminant against SM background processes dominated by top and \(W\) pair production. The \(m_{\rm T2}\) variable addresses the case where two identical 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:12]

exercise, which typically correspond to a statistics of the order of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). In order to avoid biasing the results towards high cut values, when the number of MC events in the sample is zero, an upwards poissonian error corresponding to one MC event is assumed in the significance calculation.

In general, a ten-fold increase in integrated luminosity increases the sensitive stop mass range by more than 100 GeV in both scenarios considered. Further improvements in analyses techniques exploiting specific features that differentiate signal from SM background (_i.e._ missing transverse momentum shape, angular correlations, boosted objects) and taking into account additional final states can considerably extend the mass reach especially in case of heavy \(\tilde{X}_{1}^{0}\).

## 4 Search for the direct production of weak gauginos

### Physics Motivation

Weak gauginos can originate in cascade decays from squark and gluino production or can be directly produced via weak interactions. In scenarios with heavy gluinos and squarks, the direct pair production of weak gauginos, with masses in the hundreds of GeV range and under the assumption of naturalness [35, 36], becomes the dominant SUSY process at the LHC [40]. The \(\tilde{X}_{1}^{\pm}\) can decay as \(\tilde{X}_{1}^{\pm}\to W^{\pm(*)}\tilde{X}_{1}^{0}\) whereas the \(\tilde{X}_{2}^{0}\) as \(\tilde{X}_{2}^{0}\to Z^{(*)}\tilde{X}_{1}^{0}\), leading to final states with three leptons and large missing transverse momentum.

This section presents a study of a search for the associated production of \(\tilde{X}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{X}_{2}^{0}\) in the multilepton final state. The results from the search are interpreted in the context of a simplified model [41, 42] for pair-production of \(\tilde{X}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{X}_{2}^{0}\) via \(s\)-channel. The signal MC samples are produced with PYTHIA and the yields are normalized to the NLO cross-section calculated with PROSPINO. The cross-section ranges from 10 to \(10^{-2}\) pb for masses between 50 and 600GeV as shown in Fig. 9. A branching ratio BR(\(\tilde{X}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{X}_{2}^{0}\to W^{(*)}\tilde{X}_{1}^{0}Z^{(*)} \tilde{X}_{1}^{0}\)) of 100% is assumed. For the search, two benchmark scenarios are selected:* \(m_{\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}}=\)300 GeV and \(m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}=\)200 GeV labelled "small-mass-difference" (smd);
* \(m_{\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}}=\)700 GeV and \(m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}=\)200 GeV labelled "large-mass-difference" (lmd).

### Background Estimate

The background for a signal with three leptons and large \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is dominated by the irreducible process \(WZ^{(*)}\) and by the reducible process \(t\bar{t}\), mimicking the signal when one of the \(b\)-quarks in the event decays semileptonically and is mis-identified as a prompt isolated lepton. Other SM processes are assumed to be negligible based on the on the backgrounds estimated in Ref. [15].

### Event Selection

Events are selected if they contain at least three candidate leptons4 with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than 10 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.6\). At least one lepton must satisfy the single-lepton trigger theshold described in Section 1. All leptons are requested to be separated from each other and from candidate jets. The latter requirement is imposed to suppress the background from semi-leptonic decays of heavy-flavor quarks. This source of background is further suppressed by vetoing events containing at least one \(b\)-quark candidate. To reduce the contamination from low mass resonances, events with a same-flavor opposite-sign (SFOS) pair of leptons with mass below 20 GeV are also rejected. Finally the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is requested to be above 150 GeV. At this stage of the selection, called "pre-selection", the signal over background is significantly below one.

Footnote 4: In the following, leptons are electrons and muons including those from the \(\tau\)-lepton decays but do not include hadronically-decaying \(\tau\)-leptons

The sensitivity is improved by means of a multivariate approach to the search. Boosted Decision Trees are trained to discriminate the signal and the background based on the following set of input observables:

* \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\);

Figure 9: The NLO cross-section of the associated pair-production of mass-degenerate heavy weak gauginos.

* \(m_{\rm T}=\sqrt{2\times p_{\rm T,\ell}\times(1-cos(\Delta\phi)}\) where \(\ell\) is the lepton which does not form the \(Z\)-boson candidate and \(\Delta\phi\) is the angular separation of this lepton and the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)
* \(p_{\rm T}\) of the leptons;
* mass of the \(Z\)-boson candidate;
* \(p_{\rm T}\) of the \(Z\)-boson candidate;
* \(\rm sumE_{\rm T}=\Sigma_{i=1}^{N}p_{\rm T,j_{i}}\) where \(j_{i}\) indicates a jet candidate in the event.

Dedicated BDTs are optimized signal point by signal point to exploit the variation of kinematics depending on the mass hierarchy between the heavy weak gauginos and the LPS. It is found that two BDTs are optimal to yield good sensitivity in the accessible region of the parameter space. One BDT is optimized using the "smd" benchmark point and targets scenarios with small-mass splitting; the second BDT is optimized using the "lmd" signal point and targets large-mass spitting cases.

The signal region will include events satisfying the pre-selection defined above and a lower cut on the BDT score. The value is obtained by optimizing the significance for each signal point.

### Expected Sensitivity

With an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), scenarios with chargino masses up to 350 GeV can be discovered for \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) mass values below 250 GeV. With a ten-fold increase in luminosity, the discovery potential is extended to scenarios with chargino masses values above 800 GeV 5 and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) masses below \(\sim\)350 GeV (see Figure 10(b) ). Independent studies [43] show a similar discovery potential for processes like \(pp\to\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\)+\(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\to(h\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0})+(W^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0})\).

Footnote 5: Further studies carried out on signal grid with coarser granularity indicated that the discovery potential reaches 1 TeV.

The case of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are reported.

Conclusions

The sensitivity to heavy SUSY particles will be increased significantly when the centre of mass-energy of the LHC reaches a value close to the design one, _i.e_\(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. An increase of integrated luminosity from 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) improves the sensitivity to gluinos and first/second generation squarks by approximately 400-500 GeV reaching masses above 3 TeV  and to stops by more than 100-150 GeV reaching masses of 1 TeV. The discovery potential for charginos and heavy neutralinos extends by almost 500 GeV in chargino mass reaching masses above 1 TeV, _i.e._ it doubles with the increased dataset.
