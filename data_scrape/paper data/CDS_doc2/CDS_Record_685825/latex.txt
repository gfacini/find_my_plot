This note is short because it is an update of ongoing work at the University of Arizona which has been reported in detail in previous ATLAS internal notes. Briefly, these calculations are done with GEANT and the GEANT/GCALOR interface to CALOR, which does neutron transport to energies below thermal. The minimum bias events are provided by DTUJET. We work in close collaboration with Alfredo Ferrari and the Milan group, doing crosscheck and complementary studies. When making comparisons with Milan studies, which are done with FLUKA, one should multiply our results by 1.7 to account for different assumptions about the maximum luminosity to be attained by the LHC.

In this note are the results of four geometry studies, plus one plot from a separate \(\eta\) optimization study. The four geometries are (1) L.O.I. baseline with an iron shielding cone which tapers from about 15 cm to 30 cm thickness inside the forward toroid, and a 20 cm thick shielding plate, (2) the June integrated geometry has been reported previously, (3) a fairly close copy of the TP5 geometry of Alfredo Ferrari, and (4) the same as 3, but with the toroid shield outer radius increased by 20 cm (from 60 to 80). Pictures of these four geometries are shown in the first sequence. One dimensional comparison plots are shown in the second sequence, and 2d flux plots are shown in the succeeding sections.

Since there has not been time or CPU power to redo the first two studies, some chronological developments have crept in and created some confusion. The L.O.I. calculationwas done last February when pure Fe was being used for shielding (as noted on the enclosed pictures). After our April working meeting this was changed to Fe with 5% carbon, but subsequent studies showed a very strong dependence of the neutron absorption on this parameter, even up to high carbon ratios. So part of the difference between the L.O.I. simulation and the June one is this material difference, and part is the shielding thickness. In addition, neither of these early options has polyethylene in the toroid region.

The TP5 design has rates which are generally quite comparable to the thick integrated design studied in June. TP5 has considerably larger muon acceptance at high \(\eta\) than the June design. But the resulting background rates are now thought to be too high, in that they allow too little safety margin for muon chamber operation. As a result we studied a design very similar to TP5, but with the copper shielding inside the forward muon toroid thickened by 20 \(cm\). This design holds promise for meeting the requirements for low neutron, photon, and charged particle backgrounds in the muon system.

A separate study was done to see if there was an optimum \(\eta\) line for the inner edge of the forward shielding from behind the endcap calorimeter to the front of the copper shield (the quad. shield). This study shows that there if there is an optimization point, it is very "weak". The statistics are a bit limited in this study, but even the most extreme differences between 4.5 and 4.8 are not greater than a factor of 2. As the shielding is brought closer to the beamline it intercepts more high energy flux, but the thicker shielding removes the extra, and the two effects almost exactly cancel. This conclusion is not generalizable, of course, since it also depends on how thick the beampipe is in this region. The study would have to be repeated if the beampipe is changed.
