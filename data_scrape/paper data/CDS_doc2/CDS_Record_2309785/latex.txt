The ATLAS Collaboration

The measurement of the absolute momentum scale of charged particles provided by the ATLAS inner detector is affected by biases related to geometrical deformations which are not well constrained by the track-based alignment procedure. The focus of this note is on momentum biases related to radial distortions of the inner detector. The \(J/\psi\), \(\Upsilon\), and \(Z\)-boson resonances decaying into pairs of muons are used to study and quantify such radial distortions in the barrel region of the inner detector. The analysis is performed on data collected in 2016 during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider, and corresponding to 33 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.

## 1 Introduction

The determination of the absolute momentum scale of charged particles as measured by the ATLAS inner detector (ID) is fundamental for several precision measurements, including measurements of the masses of the Higgs and bosons [1, 2, 3]. The measurement of the track momentum provided by the ATLAS ID may be affected by various sources of biases: incomplete knowledge of the amount of material in the detector, imperfect measurement of the direction and strength of the magnetic field, and residual geometrical deformations after the alignment of the ID. The latter can be either real detector distortions or artificial deformations introduced by the alignment procedure itself.

The focus of this note is on detector deformations which are connected to the radial distortion of the ID, that is a geometrical deformation in which measurements on a track are radially displaced by an amount proportional to their distance from the interaction point. The \(J/\psi\), \(\Upsilon\), and \(Z\)-boson resonances decaying into pairs of muons are used to study and precisely quantify such possible displacements. The analysis is based on a data sample of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV corresponding to 33 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity collected in 2016 during Run 2 of the LHC.

## 2 The ATLAS detector

The ATLAS detector [4] at the LHC is a multipurpose particle detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry that covers nearly the entire solid angle around the collision point.1 It consists of an inner tracking system (inner detector, ID), a superconducting solenoid, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer. The inner detector is described below. Lead/liquid-argon sampling calorimeters provide electromagnetic energy measurements with high granularity and a hadronic (steel/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range up to \(|\eta|<1.7\). The end-cap and forward regions are instrumented with liquid-argon calorimeters for both the electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements up to \(|\eta|=4.9\). The outer part of the detector consists of a muon spectrometer with high-precision tracking chambers for coverage up to \(|\eta|=2.7\), fast detectors for triggering over \(|\eta|\) < 2.4, and three large superconducting toroid magnets with eight coils each. The ATLAS detector has a two-level trigger system to select events for offline analysis [5].

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuth around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

In Run 2, the ATLAS ID [6] consists of three subdetectors based on different technologies: a pixel detector, including the insertable B-Layer (IBL), a semiconductor tracker (SCT), and a transition radiation tracker (TRT). The ATLAS ID is surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field. The ID was designed to reconstruct charged particles within a pseudorapidity range of \(|\eta|<2.5\). Technical details of the various different ID subdetectors are listed in Table 1. Figure 1 shows a schematic view of the barrel region of the ID.

The outer three barrel layers and the endcap layers of the pixel detector [7] consist of 1744 silicon pixel modules arranged in three barrel layers and two end caps with three disks each. The active area of each module is 16.4 mm \(\times\) 60.8 mm, while the size of each pixel is 50 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 400 \(\mu\)m. The expected hit (detector measurement) resolution is \(\sim\)10 \(\mu\)m along the \(r\) and \(\phi\) coordinates and \(\sim\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline Subdetector & Element size & Intrinsic resolution [\(\mu\)m] & Radius barrel layers [mm] \\ \hline IBL & 50 \(\mu\)m (\(r\)–\(\phi\)) \(\times\)250 \(\mu\)m (\(z\)) & 8\(\times\)40 & 33.2 \\ Pixel & 50 \(\mu\)m (\(r\)–\(\phi\)) \(\times\)400 \(\mu\)m (\(z\)) & 10\(\times\)115 & 50.5, 88.5, 122.5 \\ SCT & 80 \(\mu\)m & 17 & 299, 371, 443, 514 \\ TRT & 4 mm & 130 & from 554 to 1082 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The intrinsic resolution of the IBL and the pixel detector is reported along the \(r\)–\(\phi\) and \(z\), whereas it is shown for the SCT and TRT detectors only along \(r\)–\(\phi\). For the SCT and TRT detectors the element size refers to the pitch of the readout strips and the diameter of the straw tube, respectively.

coordinate. The IBL [8; 9] was added as an additional layer to the pixel detector, reducing the distance from the interaction point to the first tracking layer. It consists of 280 silicon pixel modules arranged on 14 azimuthal carbon fibre staves surrounding the beam pipe at a mean radius of 33 mm. Each stave is instrumented with 12 double-chip planar modules, covering the region of \(|\eta|<2.7\), and 8 single chip modules with 3D sensors [10], four at each end of the stave (\(2.7<|\eta|<3\)). The measured hit resolution is \(\sim\)10 \(\mu\)m along the \(r\) and \(\phi\) coordinates and \(\sim\)70 \(\mu\)m along the \(z\) coordinate [11]. The SCT [12] consists of 4088 silicon strip modules, arranged in four barrel layers and two end caps with nine wheels each. Each module consists of two pairs of single-sided strip sensors glued back to back with a 40 mrad stereo-angle. The barrel SCT sensors have a uniform strip pitch of 80 \(\mu\)m, while the end-cap sensor strips run radially. The intrinsic resolution is \(\sim\)17 \(\mu\)m in \(r\)\(-\)\(\phi\). The TRT [13] is the outermost of the ID subdetectors and is made of approximately 350 thousands gas-filled straw tubes (4 mm diameter) with a single hit resolution of \(\sim\)130 \(\mu\)m along \(r\)\(-\)\(\phi\). The TRT tubes are in their turn arranged in 96 barrel modules (32 per layer) and 40 wheels in total.

## 3 Inner detector alignment

The determination of the geometry of the ATLAS ID tracking system is performed with a track-based alignment algorithm. The formalism is based on the minimisation of the track-to-hit residuals with the least squares method. The alignment is able to cope with relatively rapid movements of the detector (currently the offline ID alignment update is performed down to 20 minutes granularity), as well as with slow drifts of different mechanical units occurring over a data-taking year [14].

Within the hierarchical description of the ID geometry, each module or a grouped collection of modules of the ID, e.g. a subdetector, can be treated as an alignable structure. The alignment is performed at different hierarchical levels following the structure of the ID. Starting with the largest physical structures at Level 1, the detector subsystems are aligned separating into end-cap and barrel regions in order to correct for collective movements. The Level 2 alignment treats individual barrel layers and end-cap disks as physical structures (barrel modules and end-cap wheels in case of the TRT). At Level 3, the individual silicon modules and TRT wires are aligned. Different alignment levels are addressed consecutively during the alignment procedure. More complex alignable structures are possibly defined by introducing intermediate grouping, or partially fixing some detector components as well as alignment degrees of freedom.

The alignment of the ID substructures (Level 2) and modules or wires (Level 3) can introduce systematic biases in the parameters of the reconstructed tracks, associated to unresolved _weak modes_ of the alignment. Weak modes are geometrical distortions of the detector to which the \(\chi^{2}\) of the alignment fit remains approximately invariant. In a weak mode distortion, the detector geometry is deformed in such a way that the reconstructed tracks still follow a helical path, but their parameters are biased by the distorted geometry. Weak modes have two possible origins, they can be real detector distortions which are left uncorrected by the alignment procedure, or they can be artificial detector deformations introduced by the alignment procedure itself. In both cases the geometry used in the reconstruction does not match the actual detector geometry, and the track parameters are consequently biased.

## 4 Radial distortion

An example of a weak mode is a radial distortion of the detector, in which the measurements on a track are displaced proportionally to their radial coordinate: \(\delta R\propto r\). The \(\delta R\) distortion is considered to be local, and varies as a function of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\). The mechanical structure of the detector may introduce more complicated expansion patterns. The deformation considered here represents a simple linear model, which, nevertheless, is able to account for the dominant effects.

Such a distortion does not strictly preserve the helical path of the trajectory. However, when the deformation scale is small, the helical path is preserved to a good approximation. These distortions result in a change of the apparent track curvature and bias equally the momentum of positively- and negatively-charged particles.

The transverse momentum of a particle with charge \(q\) that emerges from the centre of a cylindrical detector of radius \(R_{0}\), with uniform magnetic field \(B\) along the cylinder axis, is given by

\[p_{\mathrm{T}}\sim q\ B\ \frac{R_{0}^{2}}{8s}, \tag{1}\]

with \(s\) the sagitta of the trajectory.2

Footnote 2: In Eq. 1 a term proportional to \(s\) has been neglected, given that \(s\ll R_{0}\).

A radial distortion is a deformation of the detector geometry which alters the radius of the detector to \(\tilde{R}_{0}=R_{0}+\delta R\). The radial-distortion model considered in this analysis is based on the assumption that the geometrical deformation affects the tracks only along their longitudinal direction. According to this assumption, the radial distortion does not change the sagitta of the trajectory, as shown in Figure 2.

Using Eq.1, and neglecting quadratic terms proportional to \(\delta R_{0}^{2}\), the relation between the true momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the momentum reconstructed with the distorted geometry \(\tilde{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\) is

\[\tilde{p}_{\mathrm{T}}=p_{\mathrm{T}}(1+2\epsilon), \tag{2}\]

where \(\epsilon=\delta R/R_{0}\) is the magnitude of the radial distortion. A radial distortion also induces a bias in the polar angle \(\theta\) of the reconstructed track, as shown schematically in Figure 2. The true value of the polar angle \(\theta\) and its value \(\tilde{\theta}\), as reconstructed with the distorted geometry, are related as follows:

\[\cot\tilde{\theta}=\cot\theta(1+\epsilon)^{-1}. \tag{3}\]

Finally, the effect of the radial distortion on the longitudinal component of the momentum is given by:

\[\tilde{p}_{\mathrm{z}}=p_{\mathrm{z}}(1+2\epsilon)(1+\epsilon)^{-1}\sim p_{ \mathrm{z}}(1+\epsilon), \tag{4}\]

where \(p_{\mathrm{z}}\) is the true longitudinal momentum and \(\tilde{p}_{\mathrm{z}}\) is the longitudinal momentum reconstructed with the distorted geometry.

It should be noted that biases in the measurement of the strength of the magnetic field, \(B\) in Eq. 1, would determine an effect on the measurement of the transverse momentum of tracks equivalent to Eq. 2, but they would not affect the measurement of the polar angle \(\theta\).

## 5 Methodology

The particle decays \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), \(\Upsilon\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), and \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) are used to measure the absolute momentum scale, and to infer the radial distortion coefficient \(\epsilon=\delta R/R_{0}\). For the \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) resonances, only the \(1s\) state is considered. The analysis considers the effect of the momentum bias on the reconstructed invariant mass of the \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pair. In general, each particle is detected in a different region of the detector. Since radial distortions can be local, the radial distortion coefficient is a local function \(\epsilon(\eta,\phi)\).

The relationship between the invariant mass reconstructed with perfectly aligned detector, \(m_{\mu\mu}\), and the invariant mass reconstructed using the distorted detector geometry, \(\tilde{m}_{\mu\mu}\), is:

\[m_{\mu\mu}^{2}=\tilde{m}_{\mu\mu}^{2} + 2\left[\tilde{\mathbf{p}}^{+}\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{p}}^{-}+\tilde{\mathbf{p}} _{\mathrm{ T}}^{+}\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_{\mathrm{ T}}^{-}-\frac{\tilde{E}^{-}}{\tilde{E}^{+}}\left((\tilde{E}^{+})^{2}+( \tilde{p}_{\mathrm{ T}}^{+})^{2}\right)\right]\epsilon(\eta^{+},\phi^{+}) \tag{5}\] \[+ 2\left[\tilde{\mathbf{p}}^{+}\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{p}}^{-}+\tilde{\mathbf{p}} _{\mathrm{ T}}^{+}\cdot\tilde{\mathbf{p}}_{\mathrm{ T}}^{-}-\frac{\tilde{E}^{+}}{\tilde{E}^{-}}\left((\tilde{E}^{-})^{2}+( \tilde{p}_{\mathrm{ T}}^{-})^{2}\right)\right]\epsilon(\eta^{-},\phi^{-}),\]

where \(\tilde{\mathbf{p}}\) and \(\tilde{E}\) are the momentum and energy of the muons reconstructed with the distorted geometry, and the \(+\) and \(-\) superscripts refer to the positively- and negatively-charged muons.

The radial distortion coefficients \(\epsilon(\eta,\phi)\) are computed following an iterative procedure. The momentum of each muon is left uncorrected in the first iteration, and corrected with the current values of \(\epsilon(\eta,\phi)\) in the following iterations. The reconstructed invariant mass distribution, computed with the corrected muon momenta, is binned corresponding to the \((\eta,\phi)\) values of each lepton, and the value of \(\tilde{m}_{\mu\mu}\) in each bin is estimated with a Gaussian fit to the invariant mass spectrum. The fit range is adjusted iteratively

Figure 2: Schematic representation of the effect of a radial distortion on (a) the sagitta of the track and (b) the polar angle \(\theta\) of the track. In (a) the reconstructed points are located at different radii, but at the same transverse distance, leaving the sagitta invariant. In (b) true points are given in grey, while the reconstructed points with the distorted geometry are shown in red. In this model, the \(z\) coordinate of the points is preserved and the \(r\) coordinate is changed proportionally to the true radius.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

The measured radial distortion coefficients as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are fit with a linear function \(\epsilon(p_{\mathrm{T}})=\epsilon_{0}+k_{\mathrm{P}}\). The fits yield for the constant term \(\epsilon_{0}\) values of \((-5.0\pm 0.3)\times 10^{-4}\) for the \(J/\psi\), \((-5.1\pm 0.1)\times 10^{-4}\) for the \(\Upsilon\), and \((-6.4\pm 1.4)\times 10^{-4}\) for the \(Z\) boson. The linear term \(k\) is compatible with zero within a maximum of 1.5 standard deviations in all the three cases. The \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) fits test the compatibility of \(k\) with zero at the level of \(10^{-6}\)\(\mathrm{GeV}^{-1}\). The results using \(J/\psi\), \(\Upsilon\), and \(Z\)-boson events are compared in Figure 3. The three samples give compatible results, and the radial distortion coefficient is uniform as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), as expected in the presence of a radial distortion of the detector or of an offset in the strength of the magnetic field. The measured radial distortion coefficient corresponds to a correction of the absolute transverse momentum scale of \(\alpha=2\epsilon\sim-0.1\%\) (see Eq. 2).

## 7 Conclusion

An absolute transverse momentum scale correction of approximately \(-0.1\%\) is obtained from the analysis of \(J/\psi\), \(\Upsilon\), and \(Z\)-boson resonances decaying into pairs of muons, and interpreted as a radial distortion of the barrel region of the ATLAS ID. The radial distortion is compatible for all resonances and it is uniform across the momentum spectrum, hinting at a geometrical deformation affecting all tracks in the same way. The amount of material in the detector and possible biases in the measurement of the strength of the magnetic field are unlikely to be at the origin of the observed transverse momentum scale correction. The first would result in a nonuniform \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) dependence in the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region, the latter is measured with an uncertainty of 0.02% [17], which is significantly smaller than the observed correction.

The observed radial distortion of \(\epsilon=\delta R/R_{0}\sim-0.05\%\) translates into displacements of approximately 250 \(\mu\)m at the SCT outer layer and 500 \(\mu\)m at the TRT outer layer. The distortion could be either a real mechanical expansion of the detector or an artificial contraction of the geometry introduced by the ID alignment procedure. A similar bias of \(\epsilon=\delta R/R_{0}=-0.043\pm 0.003\%\) was measured at the end of Run 1 using 2012 data [14], indicating that the observed radial distortion is relatively stable in time. The result is also compatible with the determination of the absolute muon momentum scale using data collected

in Run 1 [18] and Run 2 [16]. The deformation model used in this study assumes a linear expansion, in which trajectories are distorted by an amount proportional to the radial coordinate: \(\delta R\propto r\). Such a simple model does not account for the composition of the ATLAS ID, which comprises three different subdetectors with different mechanical structures (pixel, SCT and TRT). As a consequence, the results of this analysis provide an indication of the average behaviour of the radial distortion, but cannot give precise information about the deformation of each detector subsystem.

Understanding and correcting such a radial distortion in the alignment procedure would represent a significant improvement in the absolute momentum calibration of charged particles. For the measurement of the \(W\)-boson mass of Ref. [3], the absolute momentum scale of muons was calibrated using only the \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) sample. The removal of the radial distortion would allow the muon momentum calibration for the measurement of the \(W\)-boson mass to be performed using the sample of \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). The larger number of \(J/\psi\) events would allow a determination of the muon momentum scale with a statistical uncertainty which is significantly smaller than the corresponding uncertainty from the \(Z\)-boson sample. As a consequence, a \(J/\psi\)-based muon-momentum calibration has great potential for reducing the corresponding muon-momentum scale uncertainty of 9 \(\mathrm{\,Me\kern-1.0ptV}\) on the measurement of the \(W\)-boson mass in the muon channel of Ref. [3]. Finally, a \(J/\psi\)-based momentum calibration would open the possibility of measuring the mass of the \(Z\) boson with ATLAS. Currently, the most precise measurement of the \(Z\)-boson mass at hadron colliders was performed in the muon decay channel with the CDF detector in Ref. [19]. The measurement relies on the \(J/\psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) resonances for the muon-momentum calibration. The total uncertainty of this measurement is 16 \(\mathrm{\,Me\kern-1.0ptV}\), where the statistical uncertainty is dominant, and the muon-momentum calibration contributes 9 \(\mathrm{\,Me\kern-1.0ptV}\).
