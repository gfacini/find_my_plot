**Abstract**

Wave guide techniques were used to calculate the induced signal in long radiation cylindrical detectors. The same could be done for any cylindrical geometry, e.g., resistive long parallel strip detectors. The difference with the methods used so far is that we use the full Maxwell's equations instead of the quasi-electrostatic ones.

**1. Introduction**

The problem of calculating the induced signals on electrodes due to the motion of charges in the space between them, dates back to the development of vacuum tubes. For the estimation of the signals from radiation detectors, the most cited work and the earliest one, is by S. Ramo [1]a, Ramo's theorem, which is the solution of an electrostatic problem. Another approach, a technique based on energy balance applied to ionization chambers, is presented in the book by B.B. Rossi and H.H. Staub [2]. Later on, several authors developed various techniques to cover many cases of detectors, including semiconductor detectors [3]. Among the methods used is the one based on Green's reciprocity theorem of electrostatics [4]. All the above are essentially quasi-electrostatic techniques. Application, so far, to long detectors, consists of estimation of the current on the detector in the neighborhood of the moving darge and then, splitting the current by hand into two pulses travelling in the two opposite directions of the detector. It is not clear why the above techniques should apply to cases where the electrodes (the detectors) are very long. In such cases, the propagation effects should be considered in the formulation and solution of the problem. The only discussion to this effect is in ref. [2]. Today, particle detectors are built with cylindrical geometries and lengths from one to six meters. They can be wire chambers (tubes with circular cross section) or long parallel strip detectors [5]. The application of wave guide excitation techniques seems more appropriate for these cases. We applied the wave guide method for the case of circular tubes with an anode wire (sense wire) in the center. A rather obvious generalization is given which applies to any cylindrical geometry, including long strip detectors.

**2. Excitation current of the detector wave guide**

The calculation methods for excitation of wave guides are described by many authors [6],[7],[8]. In ref. [8]a p. 301, the method used is the Green function method taken from ref. [8]b,c. It is easy to prove that the method of ref.[8]a is equivalent to the one in refs. [6] and [7]. Our present work is closer to ref.[7]. We start the calculations in the Gauss system and later on we convert and continue in the SI. The geometry of the cross section of the tube detector is shown in fig. (1). The outer radius, cathode, is \(b\) and the inner radius, anode or sense wire, is \(a\). We consider cylindrical coordinates denoted by \((r,\phi,z)\). We assume the simple case of a point charge \(q\) that moves radially and excites the wave guide detector. The speed of the point charge is denoted by \(u\). The \(\phi\) and \(z\) coordinates are constants in time. Thespeed at point \(r\) is given by \(u=\mu E(r)\)

where, \(\mu\) is the mobility of the moving particle (assumed constant), and \(E(r)\) is the electric field at \(r\).

It is understood that positive charge moves radially outwards, and negative charge radially inwards. Primes denote variables refering to the sources of the fields. The charge density for a point charge moving in a track described by \(r^{\prime}=r^{\prime}(t)\) is

\[\rho(r,\phi,z,t)=q\frac{1}{r}\delta(r-r^{\prime}(t))\delta(\phi-\phi^{\prime} )\delta(z-z^{\prime})\]

the corresponding current density is,

\[J(r,\phi,z,t)=\rho\,u\]

Let the high voltage potential difference of the anode \(a\), with respect to the cathode \(b\), be \(\Phi\), then formula \(u(r)=\mu E(r)\), gives for the circular tube detector

\[\frac{dr}{dt}=\mu\frac{\Phi}{ln^{\frac{b}{a}}_{\frac{b}{a}}}\,\frac{1}{r}\]

The field \(E(r)\) is considered to be practically the field due to the potential difference \(\Phi\) only. Obviously,

\[rdr=\mu\frac{\Phi}{ln^{\frac{b}{a}}_{\frac{b}{a}}}\,dt\]

and

\(r^{\prime}=r_{i}\,[1\pm\frac{t}{t_{0}}]^{\frac{1}{2}}\), \(r_{i}\) is the position where the charge starts, at \(t=0\), in other words, the amplification point (region), and \(t_{0}=\frac{r_{i}^{2}\,\ln\frac{b}{a}}{2\mu\Phi}\) is the characteristic time (of the signal development) of the detector [1]b. The current density is obviously,

\[J(r,\phi,z,t)=q\frac{\delta(r-r^{\prime}(t))}{r}\delta(\phi-\phi^{\prime}) \delta(z-z^{\prime})u\quad(1)\]

All formulae in [6],[7],[8] refer to one frequency or, essentially, to the Fourier transformed quantities. The Fourier transform of the current density of relation (1) gives,

\[J(r,\phi,z,\omega)=q\delta(\phi-\phi^{\prime})\delta(z-z^{\prime})\int_{-\infty }^{+\infty}\delta(r-r^{\prime}(t))e^{i\omega t}\,u(t)dt\]obviously,

\[\delta(r-r^{\prime}(t))\,=\,\frac{\delta(t-t^{\prime})}{\mid u(t^{\prime})\mid}\]

with \(t^{\prime}\) the root of

\[r-r^{\prime}(t)\,=\,0\]

from which we get, \(t^{\prime}(r)=t_{0}\mid\frac{r^{2}}{r_{i}^{2}}-1\mid\)

Finally,

\[J(r,\phi,z,\omega)\,=\,q\delta(\phi-\phi^{\prime})\delta(z-z^{\prime})\,\frac {e^{i\omega t^{\prime}(r)}}{r}\]

For positive charge (moves radially outwards) \(b>r>r_{i},\) for negative charge (moves radially inwards) \(r_{i}>r>a,\) for \(r\) outside those ranges, the current density is zero.

**3. Field expansion to its normal modes**

Any field of a wave guide, with no losses, can be expanded into TE, TM and TEM waves. These form a complete set of functions [7]. The signal from a detector is taken from its end as charge, current or voltage versus time developed at the input of a device. We assume that a resistance exists at the end. We let aside any discussion relating to disturbances in wave guides and evanescent modes near the disturbing element [6]. We accept then the idea of calculating the voltage, \(v,\) anywhere, including the end of the tube, according to refs. [6], [9], from the istantaneous integral (\(t=\) constant) of the transverse electric field \(E_{t}\) on a transverse plane, namely

\[v=-\int_{c}E_{t}\ dl\ \ (2)\]

The integral is accross any path, \(c,\) joining the two conductors (from \(b\) to \(a\)) at any two of their points. This technique has no meaning for TM and TE modes. An indication of this is the fact that one can prove easily that, in the case of TM waves, the integral is zero, and in the TE case, it depends on the path of integration and the specific points taken. To assure causality in the transverse direction and for completeness purposes, we dared to calculate all the modes of propagation up to integrals involving special (Bessel) functions. We used wire diameter (\(100\,\mu m\)) and tube diameter (\(3\,cm\)), values typical for the muon drift tubes of the LHC experiment ATLAS (Monitored Drift Tubes, MDT) and found that the cutoff frequencies for TE and TM waves are \(f=14\,GHz\) and \(f=9\,GHz\) respectively. These are much higher than the frequencies the usual High Energy Physics electronics exploit. It is safe then, to ignore any transition of energy by those modes and restrict the analysis to the TEM mode. We extended the analysis of ref.[7] to the TEM case and, in addition, we took the Fourier transform of the electric field, \(E=E(\omega)\), for propagation in the positive \(z\) direction. We get,

\[E(r,\phi,z,t) = -\frac{1}{c}\int r^{\prime}dr^{\prime}d\phi^{\prime}dz^{\prime} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}d\omega e^{-i\omega t}Z(\omega)J(r^{\prime},\phi^{ \prime},z^{\prime},\omega)\] \[\times E(r^{\prime},\phi^{\prime},\omega)e^{-i\,k(\omega)z^{ \prime}}E(r,\phi,\omega)e^{i\,k(\omega)z}\]

with \(z-z^{\prime}\geq 0\) and

\(Z(\omega)=\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{r}}{\epsilon_{r}}}\) (is the dimensionless) field impedance

The correct field impedence, in the Gauss system, is given by

\[Z^{\prime}=\frac{4\pi}{c}\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{r}}{\epsilon_{r}}}\]

\(\mu_{r},\epsilon_{r}\) are the (relative) permittivity and (relative) permeability of the detector dielectric which are considered constants. \(k=\frac{\omega}{c}\sqrt{\epsilon_{r}\,\mu_{r}}\) is the wave number.

After performing the calculations we get,

\[E(r,\phi,z,t)=-\frac{q}{2\,c\,ln\frac{b}{a}}\,\frac{1}{r}\,\frac{1}{t_{0}\pm( t-\frac{z-z^{\prime}}{c}\sqrt{\mu_{r}\,\epsilon_{r}})}\quad(3)\]

with \(b\geq r_{i}\sqrt{1\pm\frac{1}{t_{0}}(t-\frac{z-z^{\prime}}{c}\sqrt{\mu_{r}\, \epsilon_{r}})}\geq a\)

\[z-z^{\prime}>0,\;\;\;t-\frac{z-z^{\prime}}{c}\sqrt{\mu_{r}\,\epsilon_{r}}\geq 0\]

The \(+\) sign corresponds to positive darge moving outwards and the \(-\) sign to negative charge moving inwards. From the inequalities one can find easily the ranges of time \(t\) for which the various signals are non zero at each position \(z\) along the detector, including its end. From now on we convert, according to ref. [7] p. 819, and do the calculations in the SI.

Formula (3) in the SI becomes,

\[E(r,\phi,z,t) = -\frac{q}{8\,\pi}\,\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\epsilon_{0}}}\,\frac{1}{ ln\frac{b}{a}}\,\frac{1}{r}\,\frac{1}{t_{0}\pm(t-\frac{z-z^{\prime}}{c} \sqrt{\mu_{r}\,\epsilon_{r}})}\]The rest formulae (inequalities) remain the same.

For the gas detectors we are interested, it is correct to take (from now on) \(\mu_{r}=1,\;\epsilon_{r}=1\)

The voltage signal, according to relation (2), is

\[v(z,t)\,=\,-\frac{q}{8\,\pi}\,\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\epsilon_{0}}}\,\frac{1}{t_{ 0}\,\pm(t\,-\,\frac{z-z^{\,!}}{\varepsilon})}\quad(4)\]

The magnetic field \(H\) can be calculated from (ref. [8]a p.326),

\[H=\sqrt{\frac{\epsilon_{0}}{\mu_{0}}}\;E\]

and

\[\nabla\times\mathbf{H}=\mathbf{J}+\frac{\partial\mathbf{D}}{\partial t}\]

The fact that the conductors are ideal gives \(\mathbf{D}\)=0. Integration of the above Maxwell's equation on the cross sectional area of the wire gives,

\[H(a)2\pi a\,=\,i\]

\(i\) is the (signal) current of the wire.

Finally,

\[i(z,t)\,=\,-\,\frac{q}{4\,ln\frac{b}{a}}\,\frac{1}{t_{0}\,\pm(t\,-\,\frac{z-z ^{\,!}}{\varepsilon})}\quad(5)\]

Dividing \(v\) by \(i\) gives the characteristic impedance of the detector ([8]a p. 326), considered as a transition line,

\[Z_{\varepsilon}\,=\,\frac{1}{2\,\pi}\,\sqrt{\frac{\mu_{0}}{\epsilon_{0}}}\,ln \frac{b}{a}\]

**4. Generalization**

If the capacitance per unit length, \(C_{l}=\frac{2\,\pi\,\,\epsilon_{0}}{ln\frac{b}{a}},\) is introduced ([8]a p. 326), formula (5) for the induced current becomes,

\[i(z,t)\,=\,-\,\frac{q\,C_{l}}{8\,\pi\,\epsilon_{0}}\,\frac{1}{t_{0}\,\pm(t\,- \,\frac{z-z^{\,!}}{\varepsilon})}\]

The voltage is given by relation (4). It is rather obvious that these formulae hold for any cylindrical geometry with various cross section shapes as for strip detectors, circular cross section detectors, etc. We mention that, in a more general formulation, the expression in the denominator of the above formulae for the signals, should have in place of \(t\), the expression \(t-t_{p}\), where \(t_{p}\), is the primary electron drift time interval from the passage of the detected particle through a region of the detector to the time each one electron reaches the point, \(r_{i}\), of amplification. The formulae we get in this work are essentially the same with the ones calculated with the quasi-electrostatic techniques, provided we put in our formulae \(z=z^{\prime}\) and multiply them by a factor of two. See, for example, the formula for the current in [10]a. The difference is that our analysis gets, naturally, the propagation and the splitting of the signal into two, travelling in the two opposite directions.

**5. Conclusions**

The full Maxwell equations treatment of the long particle detector problem was solved. In the approximation of the TEM waves, the voltage and current induced by a moving point charge are, in a sence, the same with the ones obtained with static methods. The difference is that the propagation along the long dimension of the detector and the splitting of the signal into two halves propagating in opposite directions appear naturally. Energy is propagated by TE and TM modes, but in practical detectors, their frequencies are very high and, probably, the energy is too small to have an effect. In any case, our dynamical method justifies the common practice of the use of quasi-electrostatic techniques for the calculation of induced signals in long detectors.
