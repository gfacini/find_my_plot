## 1 Introduction

The aim of this work is to verify the results obtained with a simplified simulation ( see [1]) on the process:

\[pp\to A^{0}(H^{0})+X\]

\[A^{0}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\]

where the two \(\tau^{\prime}s\) can decay into two different leptons (e-\(\mu\) channel) or one \(\tau\) can decay to lepton and the other to jet (lepton-hadron channel), with a full ATLAS GEANT simulation.

Note that the \(H^{0}\) plays the same role of the \(A^{0}\), as explained in section 2 of [1], so one has to add the cross section of both the processes to obtain the signal rate. All over the text, the tables and the figures \(A^{0}\) means \(A^{0}+H^{0}\), also when not explicitly written.

Events have been generated with PYTHIA MC version 5.5, and the event simulation has been done with GEANT 315 ( HADR=4) and DICE version 1, the datacards used are A. E. FE. A DATACARD with a full liquid argon calorimetry and a granularity of 0.026*0.026 for both barrel and EC calorimeters.

In the detector simulation, the forward calorimeter has been used as a "dump" one, i.e. the particles are tracked to the calorimeter where they depose their energy and then they are stopped. The energy is smeared with\(\frac{20\%}{\sqrt{E}}\) for em particles, and with \(\frac{100\%}{\sqrt{E}}\ \oplus\ 7\%\) for hadronic ones, accordingly with the values written in the LOI [2].

To reduce further the computer time for a single event, in the simulation a minimum GEANT cutoff of 10 MeV is assumed. Moreover, the simulation has been made with an \(\eta\) coverage of 5. The events have been fully simulated only if they survive the trigger cuts ( see below ). The time to generate one single good event is about 140 s on Milano HP720.

The integrated luminosity considered is \(L\ =\ 10^{4}\ pb^{-1}\), which corresponds to one year running at a luminosity \({\cal L}=\)10\({}^{33}\ cm^{-2}\ s^{-1}\). In these conditions only one minimum bias is foreseen to be superimposed to the good events.

In the Appendix a study of the effects of staging or downgrading of calorimetry is summarized.

## 2 \(p_{{}_{T}}\) resolution

For the process we are studying, the A\({}^{0}\) mass can be reconstructed from its decay products. The ingredients of the m\({}_{A}\) calculation are the energies and the directions of the two leptons (or of the jet and of the lepton) and \(p_{{}_{T}},p_{{}_{T}}\) that are used to compute the neutrino energies (see 2a of [1]), for this reason an accurate study of the \(p_{{}_{T}}\) resolution has been done for the full simulated events.

Fig. 1 shows the distributions of \(\Delta p_{{}_{T}},\ \Delta p_{{}_{T}}\), that are the differences between \(p_{{}_{T}}\), \(p_{{}_{T}}\) calculated at particle level with a coverage \(|\eta|\leq 5\) and \(p_{{}_{T}}\), \(p_{{}_{T}}\) calculated using energies deposed in calorimeters in \(|\eta|\leq 5\) in the full simulation. The energy reconstruction is done using also the energy deposed in the preshower:

\[E\ =\ \alpha\cdot E_{PRE}\ +\ \beta\cdot E_{ECAL}\ +\gamma\cdot E_{HCAL}\]

except in FGPF where, at the time of our events simulation, there was a problem in the code (now fixed).

The calibration constants \(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\) are obtained from a fit on the reconstructed energy of 100 GeV jets.

The fitted \(\sigma\) of \(\Delta p_{{}_{T}}\) and \(\Delta p_{{}_{T}}\) distribution is \(\sim\ 12.5\) GeV, while \(\Delta p_{{}_{T}}\) and \(\Delta p_{{}_{T}}\) evaluated in [1] taking into account the sampling term has a \(\sigma\sim\ 3\ GeV\) and \(\sim\ 7\ GeV\) including electronic noise.

Table 1 shows the contribution to the \(\sigma\) of \(\Delta\not{p}\), and \(\Delta\not{p}\) distributions from different \(\eta\) regions. From the table it can be seen that the greatest contribution to \(\sigma\) comes from the barrel region, that the cracks effects are not very relevant (but cracks were not yet described in a fully realistic way in the DICE version used here) and the relative normalisation of calorimeters is important (the quadratic sum of \(\sigma\)'s for different \(\eta\) regions is smaller than the \(\sigma\) of the total \(|\eta|\ \leq\ 5\) region). The last column of the table shows the difference \(\Delta E\) between the energies particle level - full simulation: the calibration constants in EC seem too high, while some energy is lost in the very forward region (the forward calorimeter is used as a "dump" one and the energy lost from particles in the detectors before it is missed, while in the two other calorimeters this effect is taken into account by the calibration constants); these effects have not been studied in detail, as their contribution to \(\sigma(\not{p}_{\tau})\) is negligible.

In a simpler simulation, (total "dump" simulation), where the particles are dumped in all the calorimeters applying resolutions from LOI, a \(\sigma\) of \(\sim\ 5.7\) GeV is found for \(\Delta\not{p}\), and \(\Delta\not{p}\) distributions and a \(\sigma\sim\ 3.5\) is found for \(\Delta\not{p}_{\tau}\) and \(\Delta\not{p}_{\tau}\) computed in \(|\eta|\ \leq\ 1\). Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 show the comparison between the "dump" simulation and the full simulation for \(\Delta\not{p}_{\tau}\), \(\Delta\not{p}_{\tau}\), \(\Delta E\) respectively in \(|\eta|\ \leq\ 5\) and \(|\eta|\ \leq\ 1\).

It has been investigated why the "dump" simulation gives different results respect to the full simulation. Table 2 shows that a lot of low energy particles arrive at the calorimeters (the number of very low energy particles is greatly increased going from the vertex through all the detectors until the calorimeters).

The resolution and the energy reconstruction for low energy particles have been studied, fully simulating single particles with the same 10 MeV minimum GEANT cutoff as in the full simulation of A\({}^{0}\) events and jets. In Fig. 4 the distributions of the ratio of the reconstructed energy (using the calibration constants \(\alpha,\beta,\gamma\) from jets) over the nominal energy as a function of the nominal energy are shown for \(\gamma^{\prime}s\) and \(\pi^{\prime}s\) respectively, for \(|\eta|\ =\ 0\) and \(|\eta|\ =\ 0.8\) (in the present ATLAS simulation the calorimeter sampling frequency and the EM calorimeter effective length are different at different \(\eta\) values). There is an energy loss for low energy particles (\(E\ \leq\ 2\) GeV); this energy loss is not an artefact of the 10 MeV cutoff: it is also present for a 100 KeV cutoff with values similar to the ones of Fig. 4 (within 10%). No effect on resolution is seen for \(\gamma^{\prime}s\) at low energy, while the slope of resolution for pions changes for energies below or above 2 GeV ( see Fig.

5).

If the energy loss for low energy particles as a function of \(\eta\) and the different resolutions for hadrons of low energy are taken into account in the "dump" simulation in the barrel region (where the effects have been studied), the \(\sigma\) of \(\Delta\hbox to 0.0pt{/}p_{\tau}\), \(\Delta\hbox to 0.0pt{/}p_{\tau}\) distributions in \(\mid\eta\mid<1\) region is \(\sim\) 4.7 GeV, accounting for mostly of the widening effect; the \(\eta\) dependence of the resolution and of the calibration constants, which is due to the simplified geometry of the simulation, has not been taken into account and could explain the remaining difference.

In the following of this work no correction for the low energy effects is used and the constants for energy reconstruction are left fixed to the jet ones.

## 3 e-\(\mu\) channel

The process

\[\hbox{pp}\to A^{0}(H^{0})+X\]

\[A^{0}(H^{0})\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\]

\[\tau^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{-}\bar{\nu_{\mu}}\nu_{\tau}\,\ \tau^{+}\to e^{+}\nu_{e} \bar{\nu_{\tau}}\]

and its dominant background:

\[pp\to t\bar{t}\]

\[t\to W^{+}b,\bar{t}\to W^{-}\bar{b}\]

\[W^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{-}\bar{\nu_{\mu}},W^{+}\to e^{+}\nu_{e}\]

have been generated and fully simulated, together with the charge conjugate decays. The fraction \(A^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) giving a final e-\(\mu\) state is 6.3%.

4100 events with \(m_{A^{0}}=300\ GeV\), 2000 events with \(m_{A^{0}}=200\ GeV\), 5000 events with \(m_{A^{0}}=150\ GeV\) for the signal and 2500 events for the background have been generated using \(m_{t}=140\ GeV\).

The requested trigger is:

1) \(p_{T_{\tau}}\), \(p_{T_{\tau}}>15\ GeV\)

2) \(\mid\eta_{e}\mid\),\(\mid\eta_{\mu}\mid<2.5\ GeV\)

3) \(\mid\sin\Delta\phi_{e,\mu}\mid>0.4\).

After these cuts, the acceptance of the signal is 10.7% for \(m_{A^{0}}=150~{}GeV\), 14.8% for \(m_{A^{0}}=200~{}GeV\) and 19.6% for \(m_{A^{0}}=300~{}GeV\), while the \(t\bar{t}\) background is reduced to 39.7%. The events surviving have been fully simulated.

The highest rejection by the trigger cuts is achieved against the other possible backgrounds, such as \(b\bar{b}\) production and \(\tau\) pair production via Drell-Yan or Z exchange followed by decay to e-\(\mu\), that have not been generated because in [1] they were evaluated to be negligible with respect to \(t\bar{t}\) production after these cuts.

A further cut has been applied on the mass reconstructed as explained in section 2\(a\) of [1]: only events with a mass \(M\) between \(M_{A}^{0}-\Delta M\) and \(M_{A}^{0}+\Delta M\) have been accepted, where \(\Delta M\) values for the three different m\({}_{\rm A}\) generated are given in table 3 (the cuts are larger than in [1] and corresponds to a 1.5 \(\sigma\) cut on the present signal mass distribution).

The full simulation for this channel affects mainly the \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) measurement (see section 2), because in the mass reconstruction energies and directions of electron and \(\mu\) are taken from MC generated particles, smeared respectively with:

\[\frac{\sigma_{E_{\tau}}}{E_{\tau}}=\frac{10\%}{\sqrt{E_{\tau}}}~{}\oplus~{}.5\]

\[\sigma_{p_{\mu}}=0.03p_{\mu}.\]

The mass is reconstructed only when the solutions \(E_{\nu_{1}}\), \(E_{\nu_{2}}\) of the system of pag. 3 of [1] are positive, this condition reduces further the acceptance of the signal (8.6% for \(m_{A^{0}}=150~{}GeV\), 12.8% for \(m_{A^{0}}=200~{}GeV\), 17.0% for \(m_{A^{0}}=300~{}GeV\) ) and expecially the acceptance of the background (5.6%). Negative solutions \(E_{\nu_{1}}\), \(E_{\nu_{2}}\) can come from the assumption that the neutrinos directions are exactly the same as the lepton directions and also from \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) and \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) resolution.

The fig. 7 shows the mass distribution for signal and background, the peak of the distribution of the signal is not exactly the value of generated \(A^{0}\) mass; the effect is due to the calibration constants we use to reconstruct particles energy in the calorimeter and to the low energy effects described in section 2; changing the constants obtained from jets in the barrel calorimeter of a 10% (less than what needed for low energy correction, but overestimating the energies \(>2\) GeV) displaces the values of the peak at the nominal value, but does not reduce the width of \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) distribution.

Table 3 shows the final acceptance (that includes only the trigger cut and the mass cut) for signal and background and the signal cross-section for 5

sigmas effect. The value of \(\sigma_{t\bar{t}}\) is taken from [3]: we assume the higher values given there (\(\sigma_{t\bar{t}}=3.5\)\(nb\) if \(m_{t}=140\)\(GeV\)). The final numbers of events expected for a \(L\ =\ 10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) is then computed applying the acceptances of table 3, a single lepton identification efficiency \(\epsilon_{iden}=.9\), a single lepton isolation efficiency \(\epsilon_{isol}=.9\) and the \(t\bar{t}\rightarrow\ e\mu\) and \(\tau\tau\to\ e\mu\) branching ratios.

The value for the signal cross-section for 5 sigmas effect we find are 9-13 % higher than the values of [1] at \(m_{A^{0}}=200,300\)\(GeV\) due to the larger \(p\!\!\!/_{\tau}\) distribution (see fig.8)).

In the case of \(m_{A^{0}}=150\)\(GeV\) the result is 27 % higher related to the lower signal acceptance. In this case the total background takes also in account the contribution from Drell-Yan, that is not completely negligible: it is taken from ref [1] and not simulated.

Finally, table 4 and fig. 9 summarize the value of significances for e-\(\mu\) channel as a function of \(\tan\beta\).

## 4 Lepton-hadron channel

For this channel the process:

\[\mbox{pp}\to A^{0}(H^{0})+X\]

\[A^{0}(H^{0})\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\]

\[\tau^{+}\to had\ \bar{\nu_{\tau}},\ \tau^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{-}\bar{\nu_{ \mu}}\nu_{\tau}\]

and the following backgrounds:

\[\mbox{pp}\to t\bar{t}\]

\[t\to W^{+}b\ \ \bar{t}\to W^{-}\bar{b}\]

\[W^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{-}\bar{\nu_{\mu}},\ \ W^{+}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\nu_{ \tau}\ \ \tau^{+}\to had\ \bar{\nu_{\tau}}\]

\[W^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{-}\bar{\nu_{\mu}},\ \ W^{+}\to hadrons\]

\[\mbox{pp}\to W^{-}+jets.\ \ \ W^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{-}\bar{\nu_{\mu}}\]

have been studied, together with the charge conjugate decays and the processes with exchange e/\(\mu\). The fraction \(\lambda^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) giving a final lepton-hadron state is 46%.

In this channel the full simulation affects not only the \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) resolution but also the \(\tau\)-jet identification.

The numbers of generated events for signals and backgrounds are written in table 5; events have been fully simulated if surviving after the trigger cut (one \(\mu\) with \(p_{T_{\mu}}>15\ GeV\) and \(\mid\eta_{\mu}\mid<2.5\)). For the W + jets background a further selection is applied at the PYTHIA generation level: in order to suppress the bulk of events with only low \(p_{T}\) jets, a minimum \(E_{T}=30\ GeV\) is required for at least one of the "strings" that are the parents of the jets in the Lund fragmentation model. This selection has full efficiency in keeping all the background events with \(E_{T_{\tau\tau}}>60\ GeV\) used in this analysis for all \(A^{0}\) masses except m\({}_{\rm A}=\)100 GeV. Consequently this selection has not been used to generate the background for m\({}_{\rm A}=100\ GeV\).

A window algorithm, width = 0.5 (by S. Hellman) has been used to build clusters in the calorimeter. A track is considered associated to a jet if \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) between track and the barycenter of cluster \(<0.3\).

The following kinematical cuts are firstly applied:

(1) \(p_{T_{\mu}}>24\ GeV\)

(2) \(E_{T_{\mu\tau}}>60\ GeV\) (40 GeV for the analysis of m\({}_{\rm A}=100\)GeV)

(3) \(130^{0}<\Delta\phi_{jet-\mu}<230^{0}\)

(4) \(\mid\eta_{jet}\mid<2.5\),

so the signal and backgrounds are reduced according the acceptances given in table 5. The distributions of quantities used to filter the events are shown in fig. 10-13 for signal and backgrounds.

The second step is \(\tau\) identification performed using a set of criteria similar to the ones studied in the simplified simulation for \(\tau\) identification from \(H^{+}\)[5]:

(5) \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}<3\ GeV\)

(6) \(R_{em}^{d}<0.07\)

(7) \(NTRAS2=1\)

where \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) is the difference between the transverse energy contained in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.2\) and \(E_{T}\) contained in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.1\), \(R_{em}^{cl}\) is the electromagnetic radius of the cluster defined as:

\[R_{em}^{cl}\ =\ \Sigma_{i}^{Ncells}\sqrt{\Delta\Phi_{i}{}^{2}+\Delta\eta_{i}{ }^{5}}\cdot E_{Ti}^{em}/\ \Sigma_{i}^{Ncells}E_{Ti}^{em}\]

and NTRAS2 is the number of track associated to the cluster with \(p_{T}>2\ GeV\) (the association radius is \(\Delta R=0.3\) ).

Distributions of these quantities are shown in fig. 14-16 for \(\tau\)'s from A\({}^{0}\) signal and for all jets from backgrounds 1a (including \(\tau\)'s from W together with all other jets), 1b and 2.

As in the \(e-\mu\) channel, only events with reconstructed mass between \(M_{A^{0}}-\Delta M\) and \(M_{A^{0}}+\Delta M\) have been considered (\(\Delta M\) values are given in table 7).

Table 6 shows the efficiencies on real \(\tau\)'s and on jets after the various cuts described above (these efficiencies have been calculated over all reconstructed jets with \(E_{T}>60\ GeV\) in the event). Comparing this table with table 1 of [5], one can deduce that in the full simulation the cut on the \(R_{em}^{cl}\) is more powerful than at particle level; that is due to the better shower simulation.

Table 7 shows the final acceptances for signal and backgrounds including trigger cuts, \(\tau\)-identification and mass cut, and the signal cross-section for 5 sigmas effects found assuming \(\sigma_{i\bar{\mu}}\) as in the e-\(\mu\) channel for \(m_{t}=140\ GeV\) and taking \(\sigma_{W+jets}\) from [6] (see fig.17). The results are similar to the results of [1]: the effect of the enlargement of the \(\psi_{\tau}\) resolution in the full simulation is here less important than in e-\(\mu\) channel due to the dominance of the jet resolution; however we cannot test the agreement to better than 20% due to the stastical errors. In fact the errors on the discovery limits of table 7 are dominated by the W + jets background where the \(\tau\)-identification criteria leave only 7 events. Note that, except for the background (1a), the rejection power of \(\tau\) identification has been evaluated using all jets with \(E_{T}>60\ GeV\) and the overall rejection has finally been computed as the product of the kinematical and \(\tau\) identification rejections.

In table 8 and in fig.18 the values of the significances as a function of \(\tan\beta\) are shown.

The NHIT criterium (number of hits in the inner tracker at \(R\sim 100\ cm\) within a cone of \(\Delta R=0.3\) around the track of maximum \(p_{T}\) associated to the cluster), asking for \(NHIT\leq 4\), used in our previous analysis, at the present status of simulation has not been used because its meaning is not clear due to the work going on about the redesign of the inner detector, moreover if applied for \(\mid\eta\mid<1.5\) in the simulation we have used it brings only negligible improvement.

The cut on the impact parameter that was used in [1] does not bring appreciable improvement to these results; as studies in the framework of the new integrated inner detector are presently going on for reevaluatingthe rejection power of this parameter when used for tracks in a jet [7], we have decided not to use this quantity in the present analysis.

## 5 Conclusions

The main results of the study of the full simulated \(A^{0}\to\tau\tau\) events are :

* the width of \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) resolution is larger than the width evaluated at particle level in [1] due mainly to low energy particles effects
* the results in the e-\(\mu\) channel are worse than those obtained at particle level of \(10-30\%\) (depending on the \(A^{0}\) mass generated) due to the \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) distribution enlargement
* a good \(\tau\)-jet identification is possible with a rejection factor \(\sim 60\) against the jets and \(\sim 50\) against the b-jets (that could be improved using also the impact parameter).
* the results in the hadron-lepton channel are similar to those obtained with a simplified simulation
* the \(5\sigma\) curve in the \((\tan\beta,m_{A^{0}})\) plane for the hadron-lepton channel, that determines the discovery limit, is very similar to the one (curve e) reported in Fig. 8.8 of the LOI.

Appendix: Effects of staging or downgrading of calorimetry on \(\bf A^{0}\rightarrow~{}\tau\tau\)

### Staging: only hadronic EC

We have considered to have muons until \(\eta=1.2\), electrons and \(\tau\) identification until \(\eta=1.4\).

In this case we find that for the channel:

\(A^{0}\rightarrow~{}\tau\tau~{}\rightarrow~{}e-\mu~{}:~{}S/\sqrt{(}B)\) results multiplied by a factor.68

\(A^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau~{}\rightarrow~{}jet-\mu~{}:~{}S/\sqrt{(}B)\) results multiplied by a factor.86

From the simplified simulation of [5] we have also estimated that:

\(H^{+}\rightarrow~{}\tau~{}\rightarrow~{}jet~{}:~{}S/\sqrt{(}B)\) results multiplied by a factor.80 -.90 going from \(tg(\beta)=6\) to \(tg(\beta)=30\).

These numbers are obtained considering purely the reduction in acceptance, assuming the same \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) resolution.

The \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) resolution has been also studied in events \(A^{0}\) in the \(e-\mu\) channel in that configuration. The study has been done in two different ways:

-with a simulation where all the calorimeters are dumped and the particle energies in EC are smeared using the resolution from \(\gamma^{\prime}s\) and \(\pi^{\prime}s\) simulated in the hadronic EC only

-and with a full simulation where preshower and EM calorimeter are taken away in th EC region and the calibration constant for the hadronic EC calorimeter comes from a fit to 100 GeV jets simulated in the hadronic EC only. (With a 10 MeV Geant low cutoff, as in the generations done for our physics studies, the resolution of a jet in the purely hadronic EC is worse of about 50%.

The results from the two versions are very compatible: the effect on the total \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) resolution is small (\(\leq~{}5~{}\%\)), the effect on \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) resolution in the EC region only is \(5-10~{}\%\), but the contribution of EC calorimeter to the total \(\not{p}_{\tau}\) resolution is small (as shown in table 1).

### Downgrading: doubling the granularity

Comparing the effect of \(\tau\)-identification criteria of table 6 using the granularity.026*.026 and a doubled granularity, we find that the ratio : \(eff(S)/\sqrt{eff(B)}\) decreases of \(\sim\) 15 %, considering the pure calorimetric cuts and of \(\sim~{}13\%\) using also the cut on the number of charged tracks, giving an estimated decrease of \(\sim~{}13\%\) on \(S/\sqrt{(}B)\) ratio.
