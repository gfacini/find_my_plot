# Further studies on simulation of top-quark production

for the ATLAS experiment at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note summarizes recent studies of modern Monte Carlo generator setups for the pair production of top quarks at the LHC. Samples at a center of mass energy of 7 or 13 TeV have been generated using various setup such as MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 at leading order, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 at next-to-leading order using the FxFx merging scheme prescription, Sherpa 2.2 and Powheg+Herwig7. The performance of these samples for several physical observables are compared to the ATLAS baseline generator configuration, Powheg+Pythia6, and to \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV ATLAS measurements. New studies of \(t\overline{t}\) production in association with \(b\overline{b}\) pair are also presented.

## 1 Introduction

Run 2 at the LHC will allow a new level of precision in measurements of the production and decay properties of the top quark. In addition, top quark pair (\(t\bar{t}\)) production is one of the major backgrounds for Standard Model (SM) and Higgs measurements and for searches for physics beyond SM. These analyses would all benefit from a better understanding of \(t\bar{t}\) modeling.

ATLAS has in the past studied a number of Monte Carlo (MC) generator setups, comparing their predictions to measurements performed at a center of mass energy of 7 TeV (where a number of fully corrected distributions are available) and studying how the predictions for distibutions at 13 TeV differ among generators and generator configurations [1]. This note presents recent studies of generator setups for top quark pair production performed by the ATLAS collaboration and serves as an addendum to that earlier work. A summary of the matrix element (ME), parton shower (PS) and underlying event (UE) settings for each of the generator samples studied here is presented in Table 1. Additional information on the configurations used to produce these samples is provided in the sections below.

## 2 Data-Monte Carlo Comparisons for \(t\bar{t}\) production at 7 TeV

Because the number of unfolded distributions currently available using 13 TeV collisions is limited, comparisons of MC predictions to measurements obtained using lower energy data still provide important checks of the generators' performance. Particle-level comparisons to unfolded data are performed using Rivet v2.4.0 [2].

### Mg5_aMC@NLO + Pythia8 with FxFx prescription

The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[3, 4] program is used to compute \(t\bar{t}\) production cross sections by matching NLO QCD predictions with the Pythia 8.210 [5] parton shower, and by merging all of the underlying matrix elements with up to two partons at the Born level using the FxFx prescription [6]. Samples are generated in a 5-flavour scheme and using the NNPDF v3.0 NLO PDF [7] set with \(\alpha_{S}=0.118\). The top quark mass value \(m_{\rm top}\) is set at 173.2 GeV. The showering and subsequent hadronisation is performed using Pythia8 with the A14 [8] set of MC parameters for parton shower and multiple parton interaction, referred to as A14 shower tune, using the NNPDF 2.3 LO PDF set with \(\alpha_{S}=0.13\).

MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 samples are generated using the FxFx prescription with three different choices for the merging scale: \(\mu_{Q}\) = 30, 50 or 70 GeV1 and the A14 Pythia8 shower tune. These are compared to ATLAS measurements carried out with \(\sqrt{s}\) = 7 TeV data [9], [10] and [11]. In addition, a sample generated with Monash [12] Pythia8 shower tune and \(\mu_{Q}\) = 50 GeV is considered for comparison.

Footnote 1: Matrix elements are generated by requiring (for the sake of efficiency) a minimum pt for each light parton, chosen such that it does not bias the chosen merging scale. For \(\mu_{Q}\) = 30 GeV the matrix element jet \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold is 12 GeV, for \(\mu_{Q}\) = 50 and 70 GeV the threshold is 20 GeV.

Table 2 lists the \(\sqrt{s}\) = 7 TeV cross sections for each of the generators and the cross section at next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) in QCD including resummation of next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic (NNLL) soft gluon terms computed using the Top++2.0 program [13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]2. In the following, all samples are normalised to the inclusive NNLO+NNLL \(t\bar{t}\) cross section at \(m_{\rm top}\) = 173.2 GeV and the \(K\)-factor values are given.

Footnote 2: NLO electroweak corrections are not taken into account in this study.

In all figures, the yellow band on the ratio plot in the lower panel represents the quadratic sum of the statistical and systematic uncertainties on the experimental measurements. Fig. 1 shows the \(t\bar{t}\) production cross section as a function of jet multiplicity with increasing threshold on the minimum transverse momentum of the jet (\(p_{\rm T}>25\) and 60 GeV, respectively). All predictions are within uncertainties, with

the Monash sample presenting deviations at high jet multiplicity as expected because of the lower value of \(\alpha_{S}\) adopted in this shower tune. Fig. 2 shows the \(t\bar{t}\) production cross section as a function of the transverse momentum of the leading and subleading jets. Good agreement between the ATLAS 7 TeV data and all MC predictions is observed.

Top quark kinematics can be reconstructed from truth level leptons, jets and neutrinos, using model-independent pseudo-top quark definitions to reconstruct the hadronic and leptonic top quarks as done in [10]. The differential cross-section distributions as a function of kinematic variables such as top quark transverse momentum, top quark rapidity, \(t\bar{t}\) pair transverse momentum, \(t\bar{t}\) pair rapidity and \(t\bar{t}\) pair invariant mass are shown in Fig. 3. The results are evaluated separately for electron, muon and combined channels. FxFx predictions using A14 shower tune are found in good agreement with data independently on the choice of merging scale, whilst small deviations are observed for the Monash sample. Jet shape observables, sensitive to the parton shower MC settings, are checked specifically to compare the two shower tunes. Fig. 4 shows the measurement of differential jet shapes in top pair events for light- and b-jets, defined as jets that originate from the fragmentation of b-quarks, in two representative low transverse momentum ranges. Data agree reasonably well with A14 predictions within the uncertainties, and this shower tune is considered in the following.

The \(t\bar{t}\) MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 FxFx samples with \(\mu_{Q}=50\) and 70 GeV present an overall good agreement with 7 TeV data. The merging scale \(\mu_{Q}=70\) GeV is finally chosen. The predictions are compared to those generated using Powheg [20, 21, 22], the Powheg+Pythia6 sample which is the current default used in ATLAS analyses as detailed in [1]. Samples generated with Powheg+Herwig++ are also reported. Fig. 5 and 6 show the \(t\bar{t}\) production cross section as a function of the jet multiplicity and jet \(p_{\text{T}}\), respectively. The pseudo \(t\bar{t}\) cross section differential distributions can be found in Fig. 7. The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 FxFx predictions describe the ATLAS 7 TeV data as reasonably3

### Herwig7

Previous studies [1] have shown that Powheg+Herwig++[24, 25, 26] using the UE-EE5 tune [27] exhibits large deviations from ATLAS measurements at 7 TeV for the jet multiplicity distribution and for the transverse momentum of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. In December 2015, the Herwig collaboration introduced a major new release of the Herwig++ generator, know as Herwig7[25, 28]. This note compares predictions obtained with Herwig7 (version 7.0.1) to those obtained with Herwig++ release 2.7.1 and to 7 TeV ATLAS data.

The angular-ordered shower from the Herwig7 and Herwig++ generators is used in conjunction with inclusive \(t\bar{t}\) NLO matrix element calculations performed using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Powheg. In case of events produced with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO the recommended settings from the authors are used:

set /Herwig/Shower/KinematicsReconstructor:ReconstructionOption General

This particular setting corresponds to the treatment in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and is necessary to achieve a consistent matching between the NLO hard process and the parton shower. The reason for this is that in MC@NLO-like matchings schemes the first parton shower contribution is subtracted during the hard process generation and therefore the aforementioned setting has to be used so as to recover the correct terms at NLO after showering.

For Powheg events the following default option is used in Herwig7:

set /Herwig/Shower/KinematicsReconstructor:ReconstructionOption Colour3

This parameter concerns the treatment of the global momentum recoils at the end of the showering. More specifically, the Colour3 option takes into account the colour structure of the processes, which is not the case for the General option. In both cases, all other parameters are kept at their default values.

Figure 8 shows the distribution of the number of jets for different thresholds of the jet transverse momenta. The Herwig7 distributions produce many more high multiplicity events than the sample showered with Herwig++ or Pythia6. The Powheg+Pythia6 and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ configurations do the best job of modelling the jet multiplicity distributions4. Distributions of the jet transverse momenta of the five most energetic jets are presented in Fig. 9. For these distributions, Herwig7 provides a better description of the data than Herwig++, but none of the generators reproduce the measured shape of all jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribuions.

Footnote 4: It should be noted that in this region the additional jets are generated by the shower and hence the predictions are expected to have large uncertainties.

Figure 10 shows partonic distributions of the top-quark and the \(t\bar{t}\) system. Figure 11 presents similar distributions on particle level. In general, Powheg+Herwig7 provides a better description of these distributions than Powheg+Herwig++, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ or MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig7.

In summary, none of the generator configurations studied here provides a fully satisfactory description of the measured \(t\bar{t}\) distributions at 7 TeV. Powheg+Herwig7 is significantly better in its description of the top quark and top pair kinematics than the alternative configurations. However, the current tune parameter show a significant excess of jet activity.

## 3 Comparisons of Monte Carlo predictions for \(t\bar{t}\) production at 13 TeV

Although Rivet routines to compare 13 TeV measurements of \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections are still in preparation, the predictions from the various generator setups can be studied relative to each other. This section presents comparisons both for NLO generators and for multi-leg LO generation.

### NLO generators

The following combinations of NLO matrix element calculation and parton shower modeling have been studied: Powheg+Pythia6, Powheg+Herwig++, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 with FxFx merging prescription, and Sherpa 2.2[30] with the MEPS@NLO setup. Sherpa 2.2 is interfaced with OpenLoops [31] to provide the loop integrals for NLO generation. The MEPS@NLO prescription [32] is used to include up to one additional parton at NLO accuracy and four additional partons at LO accuracy. The central scale is defined as \(\mu^{2}~{}=~{}m_{\rm top}^{2}+0.5\times(p_{T,t}^{2}+p_{T,\bar{t}}^{2})\)5 and the matching scale of the additional emmissions is set to be 30 GeV. The default Sherpa 2.2 parton shower is used along with the default parton density function; NNPDF 3.0 NNLO [7]. The other generators are setup in the same way as for the 7 TeV analyses. For the sample generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 and the FxFx prescription the merging scale \(\mu_{Q}\)=70 GeV is chosen.

Footnote 5: This functional form is set in Sherpa using: CORE_SCALE VAR{sqr(172.5)+0.5x(PPerp2(p[2])+PPerp2(p[3]))}.

### Comparison of the different NLO generators at 13 TeV

In all cases, the cross sections have been scaled to the NNLO prediction of \(\sigma^{\rm NNLO}=831.76\) pb for \(m_{\rm top}=172.5\) GeV. The reported cross sections for each sample, together with their respective k-factors, are given in Table 3.

Figure 12 compares the 13 TeV predictions of the generators for the top quark transverse momentum, top quark rapidity, \(t\bar{t}\) pair transverse momentum, \(t\bar{t}\) pair rapidity and \(t\bar{t}\) pair invariant mass at particle level. The plots show distributions for the combined channel (both electron and muon). Although the samples have been corrected to a common value for the total cross section, shape-dependent differences of on order \(\pm 20\%\) are observed among the generators.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Prediction & \(\sigma\) [pb] & \(k\)-factor \\ \hline \hline NNLO+NNLL & 831.76 & - \\ MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 (FxFx) & 704.88 & 1.18 \\ Powheg+Pythia6 & 695.95 & 1.195 \\ Powheg+Herwig++ & 696.32 & 1.1945 \\ MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ & 694.59 & 1.1975 \\ MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 & 679.76 & 1.2236 \\ Sherpa MEPS@NLO & 725.77 & 1.146 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The ratio in the lower pannels is taken with respect to FxFx predictions.

### Mg5_aMC@NLO + Pythia8 multi-leg LO

While NLO matched calculations provide the most accurate modelling of \(t\bar{t}\) production, for searches for new physics signatures where the desire is to probe the extreme corners of parameter space it is sometimes necessary to use multi-leg LO generators to produce enough statistics in the tails of the distributions. Additionally such searches often require additional heavy flavour jets [33], or additional radiation jets [34] such that multiple emmisions in the matrix element are desired to accurately model these processes. On the other hand, control regions to aid in the background estimates can be employed in searches to reduce the impact of theoretical systematic uncertainties which are of course larger for LO calculations. Therefore here a leading order setup of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO interfaced with Pythia8 is studied with up to two additional partons in the matrix element. It should also be noted that for high jet multiplicity final states the matched LO+PS approach can provide ME level calculations for higher parton multiplicities than the inclusive NLO+PS approaches, while to achieve NLO predictions for \(t\bar{t}\) with additional emissions either FxFx merging or MEPS@NLO calculations are required.

The generator is setup to produce matrix elements for zero, one and two additional partons on top of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. These are merged using the CKKW-L algorithm [35, 36] with a radius parameter of 0.2 and 30 GeV matching scale. MadSpin [37] is then used to preserve the spin correlations in the decay of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. Additionally, in the Pythia8 merging Merging:unorderedASscalePrescrip is set. The scale of the hard process in the matrix element calculation is set to the sum of the transverse mass of the matrix element partons divided by two;

\[\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}\sqrt{m_{i}^{2}+p_{\mathrm{T},i}^{2}}. \tag{1}\]

Further details of the setup are given in Table 1. The samples are normalised to the same NNLO \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section as the NLO samples using a k-factor of 1.87.

On a single core, \(\sim\)14 hours of computation can generate the equivalent of 165pb\({}^{-1}\) (135,000 events) which can be filtered for extreme corners of phase space prior to simulation. This can be compared to the Sherpa 2.2, generated at MEPS@NLO and four additional partons at LO accuracy samples, which take \(\sim\)22 hours to produce 2000 events even with pre-integrations being done beforehand. It should be noted that as well as being LO the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 samples have fewer additional jets in the ME this is primarily driven by the fact that pre-integration could not be interfaced with MadSpin and the provision of LHE3 systematic weights in the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version used. This could be increased in future productions.

To test this setup for 13 TeV searches we compare variables similar to those used in these searches at particle level. The multi-leg LO setup of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is compared against the Powheg+Pythia6 sample that is used as the baseline for most ATLAS analyses based on 2015 data and the Sherpa 2.2 setup which has an accurate matrix element computation for higher jet multiplicities. Inclusive distributions are compared of events where at least one of the top quarks decays leptonically. Figure 13 shows the leading four jet's \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)6 for jets with \(|\eta|<2.8\). The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)7 plays a key role in these searches for Supersymmetry and this is shown in Figure 14(a). The effective mass, \(m_{\mathrm{eff}}\), defined as the scalar sum of all jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>50\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.8\) forms a key component in several searches [33, 38] so this is shown in 14(b).

Other searches use the high jet multiplicity selections to distinguish new physics from Standard Model backgrounds [34] so the jet multiplicity for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>50\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(|\eta|<2\) is shown in figure 14. Finally the number of b-jets 8 is a powerful discriminant in some searches [33] so the number of these with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(|\eta|<2.5\) is shown in figure 14. In all distributions some differences are seen between the generators at the level of 20% growing in the more extreme regions of phase space. For results which can cope this level of uncertainty leading order generators might be favoured due to their ability to produce high statistics samples at low cost in computing resources.

Footnote 8: We define b-jets as those which have bottom quark with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>5\,\mathrm{GeV}\) within a 0.3 cone in the \(\eta-\phi\) plane of the jet direction.

## 4 Studies of \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) production at 13 TeV

The production of \(t\bar{t}\) quark pairs in association with \(b\)-quarks constitutes a large irreducible background to the search for Higgs boson production in association with a pair of top quarks in the \(H\to\ b\bar{b}\) channel and other searches with high number of \(b\)-jets in their final states. The modelling of the irreducible \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) background, and the related uncertainties, plays a key role in those analyses and it is also very challenging for the MC generator community. The implementation of the latest theoretical developments is therefore of critical importance. NLO predictions with massive \(b\)-quarks (four-flavour (4F) scheme with the b-quark mass set to 4.75 GeV) in the matrix elements (ME) and matched to parton shower (PS) programs have become available recently within the Sherpa+OpenLoops and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO frameworks. Three sets of \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) samples have been simulated in ATLAS at a center-of-mass of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. For simplicity, only events with a dimuon \(t\bar{t}\) decay mode are generated. A summary of the settings and parameters used in the generation of these samples is presented in Table 4.

In the MC@NLO matching approach, the scale \(\mu_{Q_{sh}}\), the largest hardness accessible to the shower and sometimes generically referred to as "resummation" scale, is a free parameter and it is set to be similar to the factorisation scale \(\mu_{F}\ =\ \mu_{Q_{sh}}\ =H_{T}/2\). In the case of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO samples, a different choice has been adopted since only scales of the form \(\mu_{Q_{sh}}\ =\ f_{Q}\sqrt{s}\) are supported. The prefactor \(f_{Q}\) is an external parameter randomly distributed in the range \([f_{Q}^{min},\ f_{Q}^{max}]\). Since MC@NLO predictions for \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) production are quite sensitive to \(\mu_{Q_{sh}}\), the default MadGraph5_aMC@NLO value for \(f_{Q}^{max}\)[39] was lowered from 1.0 to 0.25, which was optimised by comparing \(H_{T}/2\) and \(\mu_{Q_{sh}}\ =\ f_{Q}\sqrt{s}\) distributions. In the Sherpa+OpenLoops sample, the CT10NLO PDF set is used in conjunction with a dedicated PS tune developed by the Sherpa authors. The samples simulated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO for the hard-process are interfaced to either Pythia8[40] or Herwig++[25] for the showering and hadronisation. For the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 sample, the PDF set used for the simulation of the hard-process is NNPDF3.0NLO[7] and events are showered with Pythia8 configured with the A14 tune [8] using the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set [41]. For the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ sample, the NNPDF3.0NLO PDF set [42] is used for the ME while CTEQ6L1[43] set and the UE-EE-5[27] tune is used for the showering, hadronisation and underlying event (UE).

Table 4: Summary of the settings used for the simulation of \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) 4F NLO samples at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The uncertainty quoted for the cross-section times the branching ratio (XS\(\times\)BR) is due to the limited statistics in the MC samples.

### Heavy flavour classification

Particle jets are defined at truth level, clustering stable particles using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with jet radius R=0.4. Muons and neutrinos are excluded from the jets. \(b\)-jets are defined as a jet containing a \(B\)-hadron with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 5 GeV within \(\mathrm{dR}\) < 0.4 of the jet axis. In order to identify additional heavy flavour production, the closest \(B\)-hadron to a \(b\)-quark originated from the decay of a top quark is excluded. Jets matching these hadrons are not considered as additional heavy flavour. A jet can contain more than one \(B\)-hadron, in most cases, from a collinear gluon splitting where the individual \(b\)-quarks are not resolved into separate jets. \(B\)-hadrons inside jets are counted and jets are categorized into single hadron (\(b\)-jet) and double hadron (\(B\)-jet). The events are then categorized based on the number of heavy flavour particle jets that are not originated from top decays, with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 15 GeV and \(|\eta|\) < 2.5. The "\(t\bar{t}\) + \(b\)" category corresponds to an event with one resolved b-jet and in which the other \(b\)-jet or \(B\)-hadron is out of acceptance, "\(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\)" corresponds to an event with two resolved b-jets, and "\(t\bar{t}+B\)" is an event with one extra double hadron jet.

Given the above definition/classification, the \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) prediction of the different 4F NLO MC samples can be compared. In addition, comparisons with inclusive five-flavour (5F) scheme tt+jets samples with massless \(b\)-quarks in the ME are performed. The absolute contribution of the various topologies to the cross-section is shown in Figure 15. Figure 15(a), the three 4F NLO predictions are compared among them and to the nominal \(t\bar{t}\) sample (Powheg+Pythia6). The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 4F NLO samples and the 5F Powheg+Pythia6\(t\bar{t}\) sample predict higher cross-sections for the \(t\bar{t}+b\) and \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) categories than Sherpa+OpenLoops. The 5F Powheg+Pythia8\(t\bar{t}\) sample predicts higher cross-section than MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 4F NLO samples for the \(t\bar{t}+b\) category, while the opposite is observed for the \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) category. This might be due to harder \(B\)-hadrons but this needs to be further investigated. In Figure 15(b), the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO 4F NLO are compared to 5F \(t\bar{t}\) samples simulated with the same MC generators. MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Herwig++ 5F \(t\bar{t}\) sample predicts lower cross-section than the rest for \(t\bar{t}+b\) and \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) categories, while its prediction is higher for \(t\bar{t}+B\) category. It is important to point out that the truth MC record in 5F \(t\bar{t}\) samples interfaced with Herwig++ does not allow to identify the \(b\)-quarks arising from multiple parton interaction (MPI). Different 5F \(t\bar{t}\) samples (see details in [1]) are compared in Figure 15(c). One can see the effect of variations in the amount of initial and final state radiation or in the PS model in the heavy flavour classification.

### Shape comparisons

Normalized distributions of different relevant variables across categories are shown in Figures 16-17. The plots in the left show comparisons between different 4F \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) predictions and the nominal \(t\bar{t}\) sample (Powheg+Pythia6), while the ones on the right side include comparisons among different 5F \(t\bar{t}\) samples. Some differences (up to 20%) for \(t\bar{t}+b\) category are observed in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{leading}\;b}\) where 4F MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and 5F Powheg predictions are softer than 4F Sherpa+OpenLoops (see Figure 16(a)), while in the \(t\bar{t}+B\) category the situation is reversed (see Figure 16(c)). In the case of \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) category (see Figure 17), disagreements of the order of 10-20% are present in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{b\bar{b}}\) and \(\Delta R_{b\bar{b}}\). From the comparisons between the different PS models in 5F \(t\bar{t}\) samples, it can be noticed that Herwig++ predicts more collimated \(b\)-jets and \(B\)-hadrons and this reflects in higher cross-section for \(t\bar{t}+B\) category and closer \(b\)-jets in \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) category. For samples interfaced with Pythia6 and Pythia8 the angular separation is wider compared to Herwig++ reflected in a higher \(t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}\) cross-section compared to \(t\bar{t}+B\).

## 5 Summary

Further studies of Monte Carlo generator setups for the pair production of top quarks at the LHC have been presented. Samples have been generated at center of mass energy of 7 and 13 TeV using various setup such as MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 at LO, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 at NLO using the FxFx merging scheme prescription, Sherpa 2.2 and Powheg+Herwig7. The performance of these samples for various physical observables are compared to the ATLAS baseline generator configuration, Powheg+Pythia6, and/or to ATLAS measurements at 7 TeV. New studies of \(t\bar{t}\) production in association with \(b\overline{b}\) pair have been also presented.
