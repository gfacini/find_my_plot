###### Abstract

This note documents the first attempt at using Geant4 for the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer full simulation. The development of the code for the detailed description of MDTs, RPCs and TGCs and for the connection to the reconstruction program MUONBOX allows for testing the Muon Spectrometer simulation on physics events, in view of the next Data Challenges. The \(A/H\to\mu\mu\) physics channel is chosen as a benchmark, since dimuon final state identification and reconstruction may be performed with high efficiency by using the standalone Muon System.

Events fully simulated and reconstructed within the Geant4 framework are evaluated and subsequently compared to the results obtained with the ATLFAST fast simulation program. The same kinematic selections have been applied to both event samples so as to be able to compare the final results. A good agreement is found for both the reconstruction efficiency and the signal acceptance.

This work represents the first step towards the Geant4 full simulation of the ATLAS detector and its performance.

## I Introduction

The full detector simulation of a large scale experiment like ATLAS requires a large and complex software system. Since January 2001, a new framework to manage the Geant4 detector description has been developed and the code for a detailed Muon Spectrometer simulation implemented within the alpha release of the framework.

A good benchmark for testing the Muon Spectrometer Geant4 simulation is the \(A/H\rightarrow\mu\mu\) channel, since dimuon final state identification and reconstruction may occur with high efficiency within the standalone Muon System. The standard reconstruction program processes muon hits from the simulation and builds muon tracks based on the same geometry description of the Muon System.

The first part of this work is dedicated to the full simulation results in the \(A/H\rightarrow\mu\mu\) channel. In Section III.1 the geometrical acceptances for direct \(A/H\) and associated \(b\bar{b}A/H\) signals are evaluated for \(M_{A}=150\) GeV. In Section III.2 the reconstruction efficiency is presented. In Section III.3 and III.4 the reconstructed signal is studied for \(M_{A}=150\) GeV and the reconstructed dimuon mass and its resolution evaluated as a function of \(\eta\) using the standalone Muon Spectrometer.

The comparison with the ATLFAST \(A/H\rightarrow\mu\mu\) results is evaluated in Section IV. The standard analysis is applied both to full and fast simulated muons. The channel observability and the expected rates after three years of run at low luminosity are calculated in the Geant4 full simulation scenario. The reliability of the developed code emerges from the comparison with fast simulation/reconstruction (ATLFAST) results. These studies result in [1].

In Section V, the main results are summarised and some conclusions and outlooks are drawn.

## II Full Simulation Environment

* **Physics event generation and ATLAS detector simulation.** Direct and associated \(A/H\rightarrow\mu\mu\) events are generated using PYTHIA (version 6.136) [10] interfaced to the Geant4 framework. The simulation enviroment takes advantage of preliminar studies and provides a detailed description of the Muon Spectrometer. Inner detector, calorimeters and toroids are not included in the simulation. The detector geometry/material follows the muon chamber layout M2.8 as described by the amdb_simrec.m2.D database. A particle filter stops all primary and secondary particles except muons. All electromagnetic physics processes are turned on in the simulation.
* **Reconstruction.** The muon track reconstruction is performed using MUONBOX (standalone program, version 60304) [2]. Using the chamber hit information as obtained from the full simulation, the reconstruction carries out detailed muon track pattern recognition and momentum reconstruction, performing a track measurement in the Muon Spectrometer and then extrapolating back to the vertex region. MUONBOX can be configured to consider dead material due to MDTs, RPCs, etc. to connect for the energy lost in the calorimeters. All the reconstructed track parameters, withtheir full covariance matrices, are provided at three different locations: at the entrance of the Muon Spectrometer (\(R\) = 425 cm for the barrel, \(|z|\) = 682 cm for the endcap), at the entrance of the calorimeters (\(R\) = 105 cm for the barrel, \(|z|\) = 320 cm for the endcap) or at the perigee of the track (distance to closest approach, D.C.A.). At the D.C.A., not only the energy but also the angles are fully corrected by the back-tracking procedures. Detector inefficiencies, chamber resolution and alignment errors are not taken into account. Reconstructed muon tracks in the Spectrometer have been required to pass the tracking fit criteria described in [2]. Reconstructed tracks have \(|\eta|<2.7\), according to the precision chamber pseudorapidity coverage.
* **Fast Simulation.** ATLFAST version 2.0 [9] with PYTHIA generator (version 6.136) [10] is used to simulate \(A/H\to\mu\mu\) events. The dimuon mass is calculated by using the standalone Muon System, to allow for the comparison with the full simulation using the same setup.

An example of fully simulated and reconstructed \(A/H\to\mu\mu\) event is shown in Fig. 1, in which the ATLAS volumes involved in the simulation are visualized. Isolated high-\(p_{T}\) muons result in the final state of both direct and associated events. Jets arising from \(b\)-quark (used to distinguish between direct and associated production) do not appear in the reconstructed final state as well as soft particles produced with muons.

## III Full Simulation Results

### Acceptance Studies

A sample of \(A/H\to\mu\mu\) events (10,000 \(A/H\) from direct production and 10,000 from associated production) at \(M_{A}\) = 150 GeV is simulated in order to evaluate the geometrical acceptance of the precision chambers and of the trigger system for dimuon final states.

Due to the different event topologies, muons from \(A/H\) direct production or \(A/H\) associated events have different pseudorapidity distributions. Table 1 shows the fraction of events with both muons falling within the trigger coverage (\(|\eta|<2.4\)) or within the precision chamber coverage (\(|\eta|<2.7\)) for the two production channels.

The geometrical acceptance for \(A/H\to\mu\mu\) direct production and associated production is listed in Table 2 for the three reconstruction scenarios (3 superpoints, 2 superpoints and 1 superpoint1) and for two trigger configurations (high-\(p_{T}\) and low-\(p_{T}\)). The acceptance is averaged over the full azimuthal range and over \(|\eta|<2.7\) (for the MDT chambers) or over \(|\eta|<2.4\) (for the trigger chambers). Results are normalized to the full \(A/H\) event spectrum and the events considered have both muons within the considered \(\eta\) interval.

Footnote 1: A _superpoint_ is defined as the coincidence of at least six hits in six different tube layers in one MDT chamber [4].

Similar studies for the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\mu\) were performed in the past within the Geant3 environment and are reported in [4].

### Reconstruction Efficiency

The detection efficiency (together with mass resolution) is a crucial issue for new particle searches. Samples of fully simulated \(A/H\rightarrow\mu\mu\) direct and associated events at \(M_{A}=150\) GeV are produced to study in a realistic way the performance of the Muon Spectrometer in the reconstruction of quantities used in the physics event analysis. The analyzed sample consists of 10000 events for each production channel.

Muons must pass two cuts at particle-level to be reconstructed:

* \(p_{T}^{\mu}>6\) GeV, for the event to be triggered
* \(|\eta|<2.7\), for muons to fall within the precision chamber coverage.

At production level, after these cuts event sample is reduced to 15452 muons for \(A/H\) direct production and 16168 muons for \(A/H\) associated production out of 20000 muons (10000 events) for each production channel. At reconstruction level, the surviving statistics depends on the chosen trigger configuration. Table 3 shows the fraction of generated and reconstructed \(A/H\rightarrow\mu\mu\) events according to two different trigger conditions: at least one muon in the trigger acceptance2 or both muons falling within \(|\eta|<2.4\).

Footnote 2: The event could be triggered at LVL1 by one of the two muons, provided the other falls in the precision chamber acceptance.

The fractions of reconstructed event are a convolution of trigger acceptance and reconstruction efficiency. To evaluate the MUONBOX reconstruction efficiency for muon pairs, the number of reconstructed events should be normalized to the number of generated dimuon events sharing the same trigger conditions. The reconstruction efficiencies, averaged over \(|\eta|<2.4\) and \(0^{\circ}<\phi<360^{\circ}\), are shown separately for the two trigger configurations and for the direct and associated channels in Table 4. The estimated single muon reconstruction efficiency amounts to 92.6% at this A/H mass value. It can decrease at higher mass values owing to \(\delta\)-rays and muon bremsstrahlung that affect the pattern recognition performance.

### Signal Reconstruction

Events which fulfil the aforementioned particle-level cuts and one of the two trigger selections, as described in the previous paragraph, are reconstructed.

The reconstructed physical quantities \(p\), \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) and \(p_{T}^{\mu\mu}\) as compared to the generated distributions in the case of both muons falling in the trigger system coverage, are shown in Fig. 2. The distributions, not normalized, show the fraction of reconstructed events. High-\(p_{T}\) muons are better reconstructed while reconstruction efficiency is constant over all the muon momentum range.

### Dimuon Mass Reconstruction

The most critical issue in the detection of \(A/H\) particles through this channel in the few hundred GeV mass range is the suppression of the very large dimuon background. The background to \(A/H\to\mu\mu\) is dominated by the following Standard Model processes:

* irreducible \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\mu\mu\) Drell-Yan production,
* reducible \(t\bar{t}\) production with both \(t\)-quarks decaying semileptonically into two muons, \(t\to\mu\nu b\).

Background channels have higher rates than the signal and a good mass resolution is crucial to isolate the signal.

The reconstructed invariant mass distributions for direct and associated signals at \(M_{A}\) = 150 GeV (after background subtraction) are shown in Fig. 3. The superimposed Gaussian fit (within a 2 \(\sigma\) window) gives a 5.43 GeV mass resolution for the direct and a 5.39 GeV mass resolution for the associated channel at the chosen mass value. Only \(\sim\)0.5 GeV comes from the Higgs natural width (calculated by assuming a Higgs decay width of 0.9 GeV at \(\tan\beta\) = 15 and \(M_{A}\) = 150 GeV). The measurement accuracy is, therefore, the dominant contribution to the mass resolution. The tails at low mass values in these distributions come from inner bremsstrahlung. The combined (direct+associated) invariant mass resolution amounts to 5.2 GeV.

The \(A/H\) reconstructed mass (direct production) for \(M_{A}\) = 150 GeV is shown in Fig. 5 for three different Muon System regions: Barrel region (\(|\eta|<0.8\)), Transition region (0.8 \(<|\eta|<\) 1.1) and Endcap region (\(|\eta|>\) 1.1). The poor mass resolution in the Barrel region is due to the reduced geometrical chamber coverage. This is even more evident in Fig. 4, where the mass resolution is shown as a function of \(\eta\) for the direct production at \(M_{A}\) = 150 GeV. Dimuon final states in the endcap regions are well reconstructed.

The mass resolution can be also improved by combining the measurements from the Muon System and from the Inner Detector [8]. Despite the not so good resolution, the Muon Spectrometer operating in the standalone mode proves to be a robust tool to search for physics beyond the Standard Model.

## IV Comparison with ATLAS

Fully simulated events are compared with fast simulated events with the same statistics for each production channel. ATLFAST events are required to fulfil the same particle-level cuts on \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) and on pseudorapidity as the fully simulated events (\(p_{T}^{\mu}>\) 6 GeV and \(|\eta|<\) 2.7).

The comparison between normalized distributions for fast and fully simulated events is shown in Fig. 6. Fully simulated muons are isolated by definition (no other particle is tracked). The muon isolation criterion is applied to ATLFAST muons3. In Table 5 a quantitative comparison between generated, fully simulated and fast simulated muon quantities is reported.

Footnote 3: The \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) cross section is calculated from the \(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) cross section and the \(\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\) cross section.

### \(A/h\to\mu\mu\) Analysis

In addition to the particle-level filter cuts mentioned above, kinematic cuts for the \(A/H\to\mu\mu\) analysis can be applied to the signal distributions. The best kinematical selections have been evaluated in [5] on the grounds of signal and background distributions:

* \(\mu\mu\) pair: presence of an opposite sign isolated muon pair with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV inside the trigger coverage (\(|\eta|<\) 2.4).
* \(p_{T}^{\mu}\): both muons required to have \(p_{T}>\) 20 GeV (high \(p_{T}\) trigger requirement).
* \(p_{T}^{miss}<\) 20 GeV: this cut is particularly effective against those backgrounds which have a real \(p_{T}^{miss}\), like \(t\bar{t}\).
* \(m_{\mu\mu}\): the recontructed mass of the dimuon system should fall in an interval whose width \(\delta M\) is given by the convolution of the Higgs decay width and the experimental resolution: \[\delta M=1.64\sqrt{\left(\frac{\Gamma^{tot}}{2.36}\right)^{2}+\sigma_{M}^{2}};\] (1) where \(\Gamma^{tot}\) is the total \(A/H\) decay width4 and \(\sigma_{M}\) corresponds to the experimental mass resolution (\(\sigma_{M}\sim M_{A}\cdot 2\%\) in ATLFAST) for the combined (Muon System + Inner Detector) muon reconstruction. Footnote 4: The intrinsic width of the \(A/H\) Higgs boson increases with \(M_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\) going from 1 GeV for \(\tan\beta\)=10 and 100 \(<m_{H}<\) 500 GeV up to 6-25 GeV for \(\tan\beta\) = 50.
* \(p_{T}^{\mu\mu}<\) 100 GeV, where \(p_{T}^{\mu\mu}\) is the transverse momentum of the \(\mu\mu\) pair.

The main quantities used in the analysis, \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) and \(p_{T}^{\mu\mu}\), are shown in Fig. 7 for \(M_{A}\) = 150 GeV after the kinematic selections. Fast and full simulation distributions are evaluated and compared. The quantitative comparison is shown in Table 6, where mean value and RMS of \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) and \(p_{T}^{\mu\mu}\) after the kinematic cuts are listed. Mean and RMS values of the distributions are in good agreement.

The effect of the above kinematic selections, applied in cascade to the 10000 fully simulated events, is shown in Table 7. Cut acceptances which can not be evaluated from the current full simulation5 (\(p_{T}^{miss}\) and \(b\)-jet request) are mutuated from ATLFAST. The acceptances are reported in Table 8. Events which pass \(\mu\mu\) pair selection are those with two reconstructed muons within \(|\eta|<2.4\) and with \(p_{T}^{\mu}>6\) GeV. This selection takes into account the reconstruction efficiency and the geometric acceptance6 evaluated in paragraph 3.1.

Footnote 5: In ATLFAST, the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) components are calculated from the transverse energies of all the primary particles, smeared according to the experimental resolution. In the Geant4 full simulation, the vertex filter stops all generated particles but muons. Therefore, \(p_{T}^{miss}\) can not be evaluated within the full simulation as well as the \(b\)-jet multiplicity.

Footnote 6: In the ATLFAST analysis, \(\mu\mu\) pair selection refers to those events with two isolated muons within \(|\eta|<2.4\). Reconstruction efficiency was taken into account multiplying the number of events passing all the kinematic selections by a factor 0.81 (0.90 for each muon). No geometrical acceptance is considered in the fast simulation.

Fig. 8 shows the comparison of kinematic acceptances after applying each cut to fast and fully simulated events. The effects of each cut are in general comparable for both samples. The existing bias reflects the fact that muon reconstruction and detection efficiency (parametrized by a factor 90% for each muon) has not been taken into account at this level, in the fast simulation. Requiring the reconstructed mass to be in a interval whose width \(\delta M\) is proportional to the ATLFAST mass resolution (according to formula (10)), is extremely strict, since the full simulation mass resolution is actually worse than the one estimated by ATLFAST. The mass cut has a very low acceptance on fully simulated events. The mass window can be broadened if one includes the mass resolution of Fig. 3 in the \(\delta M\) formula (10), or requires about 90% of the reconstructed events to fall into this interval7. The kinematic acceptances after the modificated mass selection result in Fig. 9. A good agreement between fast and full simulation can be observed. Unfortunately, the same mass selection should be also applied to the background, and the gain in signal, as proved below, is almost completely balanced by the background increase.

Footnote 7: Mass windows evaluated for the ATLFAST analysis using (10) are (144-153) GeV for Analysis 1 and (144-156) GeV for Analysis 2 at \(\tan\beta=15\). The intervals evaluated using the fully simulated mass resolution are, instead, (136-164) GeV for Analysis 1 and (135-164) GeV for Analysis 2.

The total acceptances after all cut selections are summarized in Table 9 for both mass windows considered (the one with ATLFAST \(\sigma_{M}\) and the one with Geant4 \(\sigma_{M}\)). When fractional acceptances are applied to the total number of events expected at 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), the number of \(A/H\to\mu\mu\) events expected after three years of running at low luminosity is listed in Table 10 and Table 11 for two \(\tan\beta\) values.

Based on the ATLFAST background estimate, the expected significance at \(M_{A}=150\) GeV can be evaluated, combining the two analysis results, according to the formula [5]

\[\frac{[S_{1}({\rm direct})+S_{1}({\rm associated})]}{\sqrt{B_{1}}}\oplus\frac{[ S_{2}({\rm direct})+S_{2}({\rm associated})]}{\sqrt{B_{2}}} \tag{11}\]

\(S_{1}\) and \(S_{2}\) being the number of expected events for the direct and associated production after the first or the second analysis, respectively, and \(B_{1}\) and \(B_{2}\) being the total background events after each of the two analysis selections. The total significance for \(A/H\rightarrow\mu\mu\) at \(M_{A}\) = 150 GeV is given in Table 12. A comparison with the results in [5] shows a deterioration of the significance with respect to the ATLFAST expectations.

## V Conclusions

\(A/H\rightarrow\mu\mu\) events were fully simulated and reconstructed and results were compared to the fast simulation ones.

Although the \(A/H\) full simulation is performed using the standalone Muon Spectrometer, the present study proves that an agreement between fast and full simulation exists but ATLFAST previous in terms of mass resolution and signal significance seems to be too optimistic.

Throughout this work, the \(A/H\) signal and related backgrounds are first simulated using ATLFAST program. Generated Higgs particles are reconstructed, and related distributions smeared, according to the expected experimental resolution. The full simulation is performed within the FADS/Goofy framework in which the Muon Spectrometer has been described in detail. This is the first step towards the Geant4 full simulation of the ATLAS detector and its performance.

The main results from the Geant4-based full simulation can be outlined as follows:

* The geometrical acceptance, studied on the database for the muon system (AMDB) with details as in the Physics TDR (layout version M2.8), is higher for the \(A/H\) associated channel with respect to the direct channel, both for trigger and precision chamber systems, due to the different event topology.
* The estimated single muon reconstruction efficiency is \(\sim\)92% at the studied Higgs boson mass (150 GeV). The \(A/H\rightarrow\mu\mu\) reconstruction efficiency reaches \(\sim\)86%, slightly depending on the required trigger condition (at least one muon in the trigger acceptance or both muons in the trigger acceptance).
* The dimuon invariant mass is reconstructed with a resolution of 5.43 \(\sigma\) for the direct and 5.39 \(\sigma\) for the associated production channel. These resolution values, lower with respect to the Geant3-based full simulation results in the Physics TDR, should be better evaluated including calorimeters and the Inner Detector in the full simulation.
* The reconstructed mass resolution deteriorates as a function of pseudorapidity, in the transition from the endcap to the barrel region. Dimuon final states crossing the endcap chambers can be better reconstructed with respect to equivalent configurations in the barrel region.

In terms of comparison between fast and full simulation some conclusions can be drawn:

* Under the current running conditions (no noise, no backgrounds, etc. ), the 90% efficiency parametrization of ATLFAST for single muon identification and reconstruction estimates well the fraction of muons which can be fully reconstructed, taking into account the geometric and trigger acceptances.

* Although the \(A/H\) full simulation is performed with the standalone Muon Spectrometer, and is therefore somehow incomplete, a first comparison indicates that ATLFAST seems to overestimate the mass resolution. For example, when only the Muon System is used for muon measurements, a \(\sigma\) = 2.49 GeV for the direct channel is found, to be compared with the full simulation result \(\sigma\) = 5.43 GeV or with the Physics TDR result \(\sigma\) = 4.3 GeV for the same production channel.
* The kinematic cuts give rise to the same acceptances on fast and fully simulated events, provided a larger mass window for the reconstructed dimuon mass is considered, in order to take into account the different mass resolution.
* The ATLFAST expected significance in the \(A/H\rightarrow\mu\mu\) channel differs from the full simulation result by a factor 0.66. This is mainly due to the deteriorated mass resolution which affects the signal-to-background ratio in a similar way for any of the two mass windows widths considered.
