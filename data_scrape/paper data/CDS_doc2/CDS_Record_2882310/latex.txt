# Top EFT summary plots November 2023

The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations

This note presents figures that summarise the limits on effective field theory (EFT) operators derived from measurements of the ATLAS top working group and LHC Top working group (ATLAS+CMS). Measurements of top quark pair production, single top production and associated production processes are interpreted within the SMEFT framework. FCNC processes are also included. Individual and marginalised bounds on Wilson coefficients are derived at the 68% and 95% CL.

The Standard Model of Particle Physics (SM) has proven to be a succesful theory both in describing observed phenomena as well as making predictions which have later been confirmed by experiments. However, there remain unanswered questions that the SM fails to answer such as the asymmetry between matter and anti-matter, the hierarchy between the Planck mass scale and the electroweak scale set by the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs field or the nature of the dark matter and dark energy present in our Universe. This makes mandatory the searches for new physics at the LHC. New physics can be probed directly by searching for new states. However, if the mass of such particles lies outside the direct reach at LHC energies, it is still possible to infer their existence by indirect means.

The Effective Field Theory (EFT) [1] provides a model-independent framework for such indirect searches. Within this framework, the SM is regarded as a low-energy approximation of a more fundamental theory involving interactions at an energy scale \(\Lambda\). New physics is then parametrised in terms of higher dimension operators which only include SM fields. The effective Lagrangian then becomes

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{Eff}}=\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}+\sum_{d,i}\frac{c_{i}^{(d)}} {\Lambda^{d-4}}\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(d)}, \tag{1}\]

where \(\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}\) is the SM Lagrangian, \(\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(d)}\) are the effective operators of dimension \(d\) and the complex coefficients \(c_{i}^{(d)}\) are the Wilson coefficients that parameterise the strength of the interaction.

The measurements included in these summary figures use the Warsaw basis [2] as recommended by the LHC Top Working Group [3]. For all measurements the series is truncated at dimension-6 and the value \(\Lambda=1\) TeV is used.

The bounds in ATLAS-only plots are reported taking into account only the linear term of the SMEFT operator (red lines) and/or the linear and the quadratic terms (blue line), except for Figure 5, where only the quadratic term is reported. The dashed line represents the 95% CL limits while the solid one accounts for the 68% CL limits.

Most interpretations follow the LHCtopWG recommendations from arXiv:1802.07237. The definitions of operators \(O_{uG}\) and \(O_{cG}\) are different in the two searches from references EPJC 82 (2022) 334 and EPJC 79 (2019) 886. For comparison purposes in this plot, the limits for coefficients \(C_{uG}\) and \(C_{cG}\) from Ref. arXiv:2112.01302 are multiplied by factor \(g_{S}(m_{\rm top}^{2})/2=0.57\) to be compatible with the definition used in Ref. EPJC 79 (2019) 886 as it is recommended in Ref. arXiv:1802.07237. Vertical format.
