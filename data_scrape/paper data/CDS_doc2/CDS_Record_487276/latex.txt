## 1 Introduction

The addition of supersymmetry (SUSY ) to the Standard Model (SM ) represents a theoretically attractive way of addressing several of the problems faced when attempting to reconcile constraints from fundamental models at high scales with the phenomenology seen at the electroweak scale. In general, supersymmetric models which attempt to solve the naturalness problem, and \(\chi\) the Higgs mass near the electroweak scale, predict a rich spectrum of physics which can be accessed by experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC ). However, most studies of experimental signals for SUSY have assumed that R-parity (R\({}_{P}\)) is conserved. R\({}_{P}\) is a multiplicative quantum number defined as ( 1)\({}^{3B+L+2S}\) where B and L are baryon and lepton numbers, and \(S\) is the spin of the particle. It therefore distinguishes SM particles (R\({}_{P}=+1\)) from their superpartners (R\({}_{P}=1\)).

IfR\({}_{P}\) is conserved (RPC models), SUSY particles can only be created in pairs, and the lightest SUSY particle (LSP ) is stable. Therefore SUSY events each contain an even number of LSP s, which escape detection and give rise to a large missing transverse energy (E\({}_{T}^{\rm\,miss}\)). This signature has been exploited by many analyses of the discovery potential of the LHC [1], since it provides a clean separation between SUSY events and the SM background. However, the incomplete measurement of the final state makes the reconstruction of the SUSY mass spectrum more di cult.

The following terms [2] may be added to the Minimal SUSY Standard Model (MSSM ) superpotential in order to incorporate R-parity violation (RPV ):

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{W}_{\mbox{\tiny\bf{B}}_{\mbox{\tiny\bf{P}}}}=\frac{1}{2} \ \ {}_{ijk}\mbox{L}_{i}\mbox{L}_{j}\mbox{E}_{k}+\ \ \ {}^{0}_{ijk}\mbox{L}_{i}\mbox{Q}_{j}\mbox{D}_{k}+\ \ \ {}_{1}\mbox{\rm{\small\bf{2}}}\ \ {}_{ijk}\mbox{U}_{i}\mbox{D}_{j}\mbox{D}_{k}+\ \ \ {}_{i}\mbox{L}_{i}\mbox{H}_{2};\end{array} \tag{1.1}\]

where gauge indices have been suppressed.

In the MSSM Lagrangian, SM and SUSY particles are grouped together into lepton (L\({}_{1}\)), quark (Q\({}_{1}\)) and Higgs (H\({}_{1,2}\)) SU (2) doublet super fields and electron (E\({}_{1}\)), down (D\({}_{1}\)) and up (U\({}_{1}\)) SU (2) singlet super fields. In Equation 1.1, \({}_{ijk}\), \({}_{ijk}^{0}\) and \({}_{ijk}^{0}\) are Yukawa couplings between the matter super fields and \({}_{1}\) is the mixing term between the lepton and Higgs doublets. The subscripts i, j and k are family indices. \({}_{ijk}\) is antisymmetric under i S\({}_{1}\) and \({}_{ijk}^{0}\) is antisymmetric under j S\({}_{1}\). \({}_{ijk}\) therefore adds \(9+27+9+3=48\) free parameters to the MSSM superpotential.

Interactions involving the \({}_{ijk}\), \({}_{ijk}^{0}\) and \({}_{1}\) couplings violate lepton number, while those involving the \({}_{ijk}^{0}\) coupling violate baryon number. The simultaneous presence of the second and third terms in Equation 1.1 can lead to fast proton decay in gross non ict with the lower limit on the proton lifetime [3]. Since both lepton and baryon number violation are required in order for the proton to decay, current experimental bounds on the proton lifetime and other SM processes can be respected if either baryon number or lepton number is conserved [2].

The di-emce in experimental signatures between RPV and RPC SUSY models at the LHC depends on the strength of the RPV coupling. We will concentrate on the trilinear couplings and neglect the bilinear term which leads to mixing between the leptons and gauginos, and between the sleptons and Higgs bosons. When the RPV couplings are small compared to the MSSM gauge couplings, the dominant effect is that the LSP can decay into SM particles. For example, the lifetime of the LSP (\({}_{1}^{0}\)) as a function of the RPV coupling \({}_{212}^{0}\) is shown in Figure 1a.

If the RPV couplings and MSSM gauge couplings are of the same order of magnitude, RPV production processes and decays of particles heavier than the LSP become important. For a large \({}_{ijk}^{0}\) coupling, the branching fractions of RPC and RPV decays of a squark can be of the same order of magnitude (Figure 1b), and SUSY particles can be produced singly, as was investigated in [4].

In the present analysis, \({}_{212}^{0}\) is the only RPV coupling set to a non-zero value. This gives rise to the LSP decay mode \({}_{1}^{0}\)! \({}_{1}\) ads. This is the most challenging case experimentally, since there are no leptons or b-quarks among the \({}_{1}^{0}\) decay products which can be used as tags for signal events. As each event will usually contain two \({}_{1}^{0}\)'s there will be at least six jets in the final state.

The RPV coupling was added to a minimal supergravity (mSUGRA) model with 5 GUT scale parameters: a universal scalar mass \({}_{0}=100\) GeV, a universal gaugino mass \({}_{1=2}=300\) GeV, trilinear Hff soft SUSY breaking terms \({}_{0}=300\) GeV, the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets tan \(=10\) and the

long lifetime to decay outside of the detector. If the LSP is changed, heavily ionizing low velocity tracks would be seen in the detector, providing a clear signature. This analysis addresses the case of a neutral LSP, the lightest neutralino (\(\sim_{1}^{0}\)), which has negligible interactions with the detector. For low RPV couplings, the experimental signature is then identical to that of an RPC model. However, if RPV couplings are above 10 [7], the LSP usually decays in the beam pipe and the missing energy signature, seen in RPC models, is not present.

## 2 Analysis Strategy

In this work, HERWIG 6.1 [8] is used as the event generator1, and the \(\alpha\)_cialATLAS simulation program ATLFAST [10] is used to simulate the performance of the ATLAS detector. Since each \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) decays to three quarks, and in general the decay chain produces the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) in association with at least one other quark (typically from squark decay), the mean jet multiplicity (\(N_{\rm jet}\)) in the signal events is high.

Footnote 1: The simulation of RPV events in HERWIG is discussed in [9].

The principal di-cub in measuring the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) mass is the identification of the correct jets from the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) decay. Nearly all right-squarks decay via \(\alpha_{1}\cdot\alpha_{1}^{0}\cdot\alpha_{1}^{0}\cdot\alpha_{1}^{0}\) and one might therefore expect \(N_{\rm jet}=8\) for \(\alpha_{1}\alpha_{1}\) production. Given radiation by quarks, however, raises this to an average of 9 2 jets, in spite of the fact that the three jets from harder \(\sim_{1}^{0}\)s are spatially close together and same emerging of jets occurs. In \(\alpha_{1}\alpha_{1}\) events \(N_{\rm jet}=10\). The increase with respect to the right-handed states is due to the di-cub in couplings to charginos and neutralinos. Gluinos mostly decay into a squark and a quark and \(gg\) events have a higher value of \(N_{\rm jet}=128\). A simple algorithm is used to calculate the jet energies, summing the energy within a cone of size 0 \(A\) about the jet axis in the plane, and at least 8 jets with \(E_{\rm T}>25\) GeV are required in signal events.

The analysis proceeds in the following steps:

Cuts are applied to reduce the SM background to below 10% of the SUSY signal. These cuts rely on the presence of lepton pairs in the signal events. Such lepton pairs are produced from the decay chain \(\sim_{2}^{0}\cdot\Gamma_{1}\cdot\Gamma_{1}\cdot\Gamma_{1}^{0}\) in most SUSY models. An analysis based on looking for events with two such \(\sim_{2}^{0}\) decays was proposed in [11] but the rate for events with four leptons is much lower than for events with only one \(\sim_{2}^{0}\) decay of this type.

In each signal event, cuts are made on the jet transverse momenta (\(p\) ) in order to preferentially select jets from neutralino decays.

All possible combinations of three of the selected jets are inspected, and their invariant mass, \(m_{jjj}\), calculated. Events are retained if two combinations are compatible with the same candidate \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) mass.

combination are plotted with unit weight. However this can lead to one event contributing a large number of combinations and therefore if there are more than \(\nu\) combinations which pass the cuts only the \(\nu\) we with the smallest difference between the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) candidate masses are included.

In events with more than one combination passing the cuts, two combinations of jets often differently in the choice of jets for one of the two \(\sim_{1}^{0}\)s. In such cases, the unique mass combination is included in the histogram only once. The two ambiguous masses are both included with unit weight.

There is a broad combinatorial background beneath the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) mass peak in Figure 5a, the shape of which is defined by the kinematic cuts and is reproduced by the phase-space sample, as shown in Figure 5b. In order to further suppress the background we attempt to find the mass of the \(\sim_{2}^{0}\) in the decay chain \(\sim_{2}^{0}\)! \(\lambda\) 1! 1! \(\lambda_{1}^{0}\) by forming the total invariant mass of the \(O\,SSF\) dilepton pair and one of the 3-jet candidates. We choose the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) candidate which is nearest in \(\lambda\) to either lepton.

By using the extra information from the leptons we are able to supress the combinatorial background. A clear peak in the (\(\sim_{1}^{0}\),\(\sim_{2}^{0}\)) mass plane is visible in Figure 6a. Figure 7 shows slices through the peak along the axes \(m=(m_{jjj})\)\(m_{jjj}\).\(=2\). The peak is present in the centralslices, while the sidebands show similar shapes to the background under the peak. It is clear that this peak is not determined by the kinematic cuts, as it is absent in our phase-space sample (Figure 6b). In

Figure 5: (a) The invariant mass of three-jet combinations passing the cuts described in the text. The mass peak from the decay \(\sim_{1}^{0}\)! \(\alpha_{\rm qq}\) can be seen above the background from wrong combinations of jets. The input \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) mass is indicated by the arrow. (b) A phase-space sample shows a peak in much the same region.

addition we find that the position of the peak accurately follows the input masses, when those are varied from \((116.7,211.9)\) to \((137.8,252.6)\) GeV.

The data in the rectangle shown in Figure 6 were fitted with a 2-d gaussian. Since \(m_{jjj}\) and \(m_{jjj}\), are highly correlated, the peak was fitted in the rotated (m\({}^{+}\)m) coordinate system in which the correlations are smaller. The mass difference relies on lepton rather than jet momenta, so the width in the \(m\) direction (4 GeV) is smaller than in the \(m^{+}\) direction (15 GeV). The standard error on the peak was 4.5 GeV in \(m^{+}\) and 1.5 GeV in \(m^{+}\). This corresponds to a 3 GeV uncertainty in each of the neutralino masses.

Our fitted masses, at \(m(\gamma^{0}_{1};\gamma^{0}_{2})=(118.9,215.5)\) GeV are slightly high when compared to the input values of \((116.7,211.9)\). This is due to several eects, including overlap between the jets, and the contribution of energy from the underlying event in the jet cones. Indeed we would expect that our simple rescaling factor will overcome for energy losses from jet cones, since the three jets from the \(\gamma^{0}_{1}\) decay are close in, so energy losses from one cone can end up in one of the other two.

A filler investigation of these eects is beyond the scope of this study, requiring as it does a fill investigation of the calorimeter calibration procedure for multi-jet events. It is estimated that in the actual experiment, the uncertainty in the absolute

The circle and the ellipse show the peak and standard deviation of a 2-d gaussian fitted to the data contained in the dashed box. The star shows the input masses. (b) The corresponding (\(m_{jjj}m_{jjj}\)) invariant mass combinations from the phase-space sample show no such peak.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:11]

in this section the jet multiplicity cut is therefore relaxed to 8 \(N_{\gamma\gamma}\) 11 in order to increase the statistics. The invariant mass of the three-jet neutralino candidates is adjusted to the best- t mass of the \(\gamma^{0}_{1}\), by rescaling the \(\gamma^{0}_{1}\) jet momenta by the same factor.

The \(\gamma_{1}\) mass is found by combining the \(\gamma^{0}_{1}\) candidate closest to a lepton in with that lepton. The resulting invariant mass distribution, \(m_{jjjj}\), is shown in Figure 9a. The sharp peak was fitted with a gaussian, with another gaussian for the background. This gave \(m(\gamma_{1})=157803\) GeV, which is slightly high when compared to the input value of \(155.3\) GeV for the same reasons as were discussed in Section 4.

The experimental electron and muon momentum scale uncertainties are expected to be small fractions of 1% [1], so the systematic error in the slepton mass measurement will be dominated by the same (3 GeV) jet scale uncertainty as \(m(\gamma^{0}_{1})\). The statistical error in rescaling the 3-jet invariant mass to the fitted m (\(\gamma^{0}_{1}\)) peak introduces another 3 GeV systematic error into the \(\gamma_{1}\) and \(\gamma_{1}\) masses. The overall systematic error in \(m(\gamma_{1})\) is therefore 3 = 42 GeV.

The hardest two jets in the event are assumed to have come from squark or gluino decay, and so are not used in making three-jet combinations for neutralino

Figure 8: The region ofm SUGRA parameter space over which the decay \(\gamma^{0}_{2}\)! \(\gamma^{0}_{1}\)! \(\gamma^{0}_{1}\)! occurs is shaded. M \(\gamma_{0}\) is the universal scalar mass, and M \(\gamma_{1=2}\) is the universal gaugino mass at the GUT scale. The lower hatched region is excluded by lack of electroweak symmetry breaking or the existence of tachyonic particles, whereas the in the upper hatched region the \(\gamma^{0}_{1}\) is not the LSP and our analysis does not apply. The contours show the mass of the \(\gamma_{1}\) squark. The marker shows the chosen point. The other parameters are: tan = 10, A\({}_{0}\) = 300 GeV and sgn( ) = +.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:13]

used in the \(\alpha\) reconstruction with the second hand jet. However while the cuts we applied to reduce the Standard Model background, i.e. requiring the presence of two leptons, mean that all the signal events contain a \(\alpha_{1}\), they do not necessarily contain a right squark. Only a third of the signal events actually contain a \(\alpha_{1}\). Most of the SUSY events at this SUGRA point come from gluino production which will either be rejected due to the large number of jets or contain additional hard jets from the gluino decay, and hence have a large combinatoric background for the \(\alpha_{1}\) reconstruction. In an attempt to reduce this background it is possible to use cuts on the \(\sim_{2}^{0}\) and \(\gamma_{1}\) masses from \(\alpha_{1}\) decay on the other side of the event such that there is only one \(\alpha_{1}\) candidate. However this reduces the statistics so that a signal cannot be observed. This combination of factors makes it impossible to reconstruct the \(\alpha_{1}\) mass at this SUGRA point with the available statistics.

## 6 Other values of \(\alpha_{212}\)

The method outlined above is relatively insensitive to the size of the coupling \(\alpha_{212}^{0}\). However as the RPV coupling \(\alpha_{212}^{0}\) is decreased, the lifetime of the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) increases as shown in Figure 1a. The method will start to fail when \(\sim_{1}^{0}\)s predomately decay beyond the first tracking layer of the detector. Special reconstruction could increase this by about an order of magnitude, at which point the decays would occur outside of the tracking volume. We therefore exclude events when one or other of the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\)s has travelled more than 100 mm (1000 mm ) from the interaction point in the transverse direction.

As can be seen in Figure 10 statistics become limiting for \(\alpha_{212}^{0}\) less than about 10 \({}^{5}\), when \(\alpha_{1}\) = 800 mm. With smaller couplings the RPV decay of the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) e actively switches \(\alpha_{1}\), and a RPC analysis based on a missing transverse energy + lepton(s) signature, such as [13], is effective.

If \(\alpha_{212}^{0}\) is larger than 0.1, an initial \(\alpha_{1}\) often decays immediately into 2 jets and then only one 3 jet invariant mass combination will necessarily be close to the neutralino mass.

The size of the RPV coupling can be determined from the \(\sim_{1}^{0}\) lifetime, as shown in Figure 1a. The lifetime is, in principle, measurable for a wide range of couplings, by using vertexing information. However the need for detector-level Monte-Carlo simulation makes the measurement of \(\alpha_{212}^{0}\) beyond the scope of this paper.

## 7 Conclusions

The usual ubiquitous signature for the \(R_{P}\) conserving MSSM is missing transverse energy. This signature disappears once \(R_{P}\) violating couplings are added, unless they are extremely small and the lifetime of a neutralino LSP is such that it decays outside the detector.
