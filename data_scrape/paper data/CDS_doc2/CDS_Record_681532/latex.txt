In the past the shower production by muons was studied by two groups, namely by the RD5 collaboration [1] at CERN and by the E665 Collaboration [2] at the Fermi laboratory. Both groups obtained a reasonable agreement of their simulated and experimental data. Yet, the simulation of the E665 collaboration overestimates the number of additional hits close to the muon track. This problem does not seem present in the simulation of the RD-5 collaboration. Unfavourably, in their study, the multiplicity of additional hits is investigated only in a 1 cm wider road around the muon beam. The area of 1 cm is too small from the point of view of the muon chambers because the diameter of a drift tube itself is 3 cm. In the present work this area is extended to 140 cm, i.e. by two orders of magnitude.

Within the muon collaboration of the ATLAS experiment, for the first time in 1998, the Munich ATLAS group investigated the multiplicity of hits in a precision chamber if a muon triggered an electromagnetic shower in front of the chamber. The results of their measurements [3] were compared with a GEANT-3 simulation. It turned out that the simulation and the measured data agree qualitatively, but also that the simulation predicted approximately twice as many hits of shower particles than observed in the test-beam experiment. The fact that no watertight findings resulted from the analysis, nevertheless, originates from the limited amount of test-beam data on the one hand and the short-comings of the experimental set-up on the other: shower particles running from the absorber in front of the chamber into the chamber could be absorbed by the support structure of the silicon telescope used in the experiment, without having been detected. Therefore, the test-beam measurements were repeated with an improved set-up and increased statistics in the H8 beam at CERN in September 1999. The recorded data were mainly compared to the new version GEANT-4 [4] which was published in the meantime, but partially to a GEANT-3 [5] simulation, too.

In Section 2 we shall discuss the shower production by muons in matter, before - after a brief description of the test-beam experiment in Section 3 and of the recorded data in Section 4 - explaining the analysis of these data in Sections 5 and 6. In Section 7 we shall compare the results of the measurements with the prediction of GEANT simulations.

## 2 Energy Loss of Muons

The creation of shower particles is connected with the energy loss of the muons. Muons lose their energy by four different basic processes: by ionization and excitation of atoms, by the direct production of an electron-positron pair, by bremsstrahlung, and, finally, by nuclear interaction. The contribution of the processes to the specific energy loss of muons is shown as a function of the muon energy in Figure 1.

Up to muon energies of about 1 TeV, the nuclear interaction contributes so little to the specific energy loss, that it can be neglected with respect to the other three processes.

In the bremsstrahlung process a muon which has been deflected in the electric field of a nucleus emits a bremsstrahlung. In the pair-production process this quantum is virtual and disintegrates into an electron-positron pair. Both the pair-production process and the bremsstrahlung process are only important above 100 GeV muon energy, where their contribution to the specific energy loss rises approximately linearly and is almost of the same amount.

At energies below 100 GeV muons lose their energy essentially by excitation and ionization of atoms. Above 100 GeV the energy loss by excitation and ionization is independent of the muon energy.

Muons therefore lose their energy essentially by electromagnetic processes. So it is, in principle, possible to reliably simulate their energy loss and, hence, the creation of electromagnetic showers by muons. This is the case for the amount of energy lost by the muon; what concerns the number of the shower particles created and detected, this statement is only valid with some restrictions. For shower particles are explicitly produced in Monte-Carlo programmes and their trajectories are calculated only if their energy is greater than a certain threshold energy which is set by the user of the programme. The threshold energy must always be adapted to the detector sensitivity. Sometimes even higher thresholds are used to speed up the simulation.

How this threshold energy should be chosen in case of the muon spectrometer in the ATLAS experiment will be discussed in Section 7.

Figure 1: Contribution of different processes to the specific energy loss of muons [6].

First of all, the set-up of the test-beam experiment mentioned in the introduction will be described.

## 3 Experimental Set-up

The experimental set-up is sketched in Figure 2. The muon beam goes from the left to the right side. The prototype of a BOS chamber is placed in the middle of the set-up. The BOS chamber consists of two triple layers of 3.8 m long drift tubes which are arranged vertically in the test-beam set-up. The three single layers of a triple layer each contain 72 tubes. However, only 48 tubes per layer were read out as depicted in Figure 2.b).

Figure 2: a) Schematic of the set-up of the test-beam experiment. b) Only the shaded cards are read out.

About 1 m behind the muon chamber, a telescope of six silicon-strip detectors [7] detects the muon track. The sensitive area of the strip detectors is quadratic and 25 cm\({}^{2}\) large. The strips of the two outermost counters are arranged orthogonally to the tube axis, i.e. they measure the vertical position of the muon. The strips of the remaining four counters are parallel to the wires of the drift tubes. With this reference device, the muon track can be measured so precisely in the plane perpendicular to the wires of the drift tubes, that the track point extrapolated to tube layer furthest away from the telescope agrees with the true track point in the plane within 20 \(\mu\)m.

The telescope is preceded and followed by scintillation counters with a square active area of 25 cm\({}^{2}\). A coincidence of these counters gives the trigger signal for the read-out system.

Approximately 60 cm in front of the chamber there is a small table which serves as support for up to 30 cm long absorbers with a square cross-section of 36 cm\({}^{2}\). This table is constructed such that there is only little material in the direction of the chamber; the shower particles can fly unhinderedly from the absorber to the chamber.

Crossed scintillation counters are mounted closely to the front of the absorber. These counters are used to ensure that the muon beam crosses the whole set-up, in particular the absorbers. The 20 cm long scintillation counters are divided into eight 8.25 mm wide fingers which are separately read out by charge sensing analog-to-digital converters. The frequency of hits in the crossed scintillation counters is depicted in a two-dimensional histogram in Figure 3. The cross section of the absorbers is completely covered by the finger counters. As the trigger counters only cover a region of \(5\times 5\) cm\({}^{2}\) while the finger counters have a sensitive area of \(6.6\times 6.6\) cm\({}^{2}\), there are no hits in the outermost fingers and just very few in the neighbouring fingers. In other words: one sees the picture of the trigger counters in the finger counters. Therefore, all muons detected by the telescope fly trough the entire set-up, in particular the absorbers.

## 4 Data Samples

The different data samples which were taken at the H8 test-beam of CERN in September 1999 are listed in Table 1. Muons with 100 GeV and 300 GeV energy were available. 300 GeV are the maximum energy of the H8 beam. For some conditions data were taken with two different discriminator thresholds for the muon chamber, first with the low threshold, then with the high threshold. These correspond to the 25th and the 32nd primary ionization electron. The higher threshold setting was used for studies with reduced sensitivity of the chamber to low-energy photons. The distances of the absorbers are given with respect to the center-of-mass of the support frame of the tubes in the muon chamber. The muon beam was almost perpendicular to the chamber, the angle between the muon beam and the tube layer was \(89.75^{0}\).

Both iron and aluminium absorbers were put into the beam because the ATLAS detector is built mainly from iron and aluminium.

## 5 Analysis of the Test-beam Data

### The Basic Idea of the Analysis

The analysis of the test-beam data is based on a simple view of the available data: the muon track is measured by the telescope and the muon chamber records a hit pattern in each event. This hit pattern can be characterized by means of the muon track. If one restricts the analysis to the triple layer which is closest to the absorber, the following classification of the chamber hits seems natural:

1. Hits in tubes which are crossed by the muon track are called _track hits_.
2. All hits which are not track hits are called _extra hits_. Extra hits can be assigned to two subclasses, to the class of _single hits_ and to the class of _cluster hits_. Single hits are hits in a tube whose next neighbours have not been hit or contain track hits. The remaining extra hits occur in clusters.

This classification of the chamber hits suggests the following classification of the events:

Figure 3: Hit distribution in the crossed finger scintillation-counters.

1. events without extra hits,
2. events with extra hits which all are single hits,
3. events with extra hits which all are cluster hits,
4. events with single and cluster hits.

The goal of the analysis of the test-beam data is to determine the relative frequency of these four classes and the average number of extra hits in the first triple layer in an event with extra hits as well as the spatial distribution of extra hits and, finally, to compare the results with a Monte-Carlo prediction.

### Event Selection

First of all, let us describe the selection of those events which enter the analysis of the test-beam data.

An event is only considered in the analysis if exactly one hit is detected in the four inner horizontal finger counters and exactly one hit is detected in the four inner vertical finger counters. Events in which no track with a confidence level of at least 2% is found in the telescope are rejected. If more than one track with a confidence level of at least 2% has been reconstructed, the track with the greatest confidence level is considered the muon track. About half of the recorded events is rejected by these cuts.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Condition & Number of & Threshold: & Threshold: & Energy & Distance from the \\  & events & 25th p.e. & 32nd p.e. & in GeV & muon chamber / cm \\ \hline \hline no matter & 80000 & X & & 100 & — \\  & 650000 & X & & 300 & — \\  & 280000 & & X & 300 & — \\ \hline

\end{table}
Table 1: Data samples. The crosses indicate the discriminator threshold with which the on-chamber electronics was operated in the given data set.

The drift-time spectrum of a drift tube, which is illuminated by the muon beam, is depicted in Figure 4. Entries in the shaded part of the drift-time spectrum correspond to hits which can be correlated with the muon detected in the telescope. Entries outside this part are accidental hits, which cannot be correlated with the muon. Therefore, these hits are disregarded in the analysis of the test-beam data.

### Determination of the Relative Frequency of the Event Classes

We are ready to determine the relative frequency of the event classes introduced before. We indicate the relative frequency of events without extra hits by the Greek letter \(\tau\), the relative frequency of events whose extra hits all are single hits by \(\sigma\), the relative frequency of events whose extra hits all are cluster hits by \(\gamma\), and the relative frequency of events with both single and cluster hits by \(\rho\).

On first sight one would expect \(\tau=1\) and \(\sigma=\gamma=\rho=0\) for the data without an absorber in the muon beam. Yet the muon beam is accompanied by shower particles which are created in the hadron-absorbing iron block upstream and is not clean. Hence, we have \(\tau<1\). In fact,

\[\tau = (66.1\pm 0.6)\%,\]

Figure 4: Drift-time distribution of track hits.

\[\sigma = (16.2\pm 0.3)\%,\] \[\gamma = (13.2\pm 0.3)\%,\] \[\rho = (4.5\pm 0.2)\%\]

at \(100\) GeV,

\[\tau = (76.7\pm 0.2)\%,\] \[\sigma = (9.64\pm 0.08)\%,\] \[\gamma = (10.68\pm 0.08)\%,\] \[\rho = (2.98\pm 0.04)\%\]

at \(300\) GeV with the low threshold, and

\[\tau = (77.4\pm 0.2)\%,\] \[\sigma = (9.0\pm 0.2)\%,\] \[\gamma = (10.8\pm 0.1)\%,\] \[\rho = (2.78\pm 0.07)\%\]

at \(300\) GeV with the high threshold. From now on, these quantities will be labelled by the lower index \(0\).

If an absorber is put into the beam, events with extra hits become more frequent as secondary particles are produced in the absorber when crossed by a muon. The new relative frequencies will be marked by the lower index M. Due to the impurities in the muon beam, these are not the same as the quantities \(\tau_{A}\), \(\sigma_{A}\), \(\gamma_{A}\), and \(\rho_{A}\) which would be obtained with a clean beam. The values of \(\tau_{A}\), \(\sigma_{A}\), \(\gamma_{A}\), and \(\rho_{A}\) must be calculated from \(\tau_{0}\), \(\sigma_{0}\), \(\gamma_{0}\), \(\rho_{0}\) and \(\tau_{M}\), \(\sigma_{M}\), \(\gamma_{M}\), \(\rho_{M}\).

The probability to observe an event without extra hits if the beam traverses an absorber equals the product of the probability to have an event without extra hits without the absorber and the probabiliaty that no shower particle produced in the absorber leads to extra hits in the muon chamber. Hence

\[\tau_{M}=\tau_{0}\cdot\tau_{A} \tag{1}\]

or \(-\)equivalently \(-\)

\[\tau_{A}=\frac{\tau_{M}}{\tau_{0}}. \tag{2}\]

We should point out that Equation (1) is only valid if the absorber does not absorb any shower particles of the muon beam, i.e. if it does not clean the beam. The cleaning effect plays a minor role in the current experimental set-up for two reasons. First, the absorbers are only \(6\) cm wide each, so they completely cover the tube which is hit by the muon and cover half of the left and right neighbouringtube - we recall that the diameter of a drift tube is 3 cm. Second, we reject events with hits in the fingers which cover the region of the neighbours of the tube hit by the muon. In the present analysis, \(\tau_{A}\) can therefore be calculated by means of Equation (2). In the Section 6.1, we shall investigate the systematic error resulting from the use of these equations in more detail.

If the case is neglected that an extra hit caused by a beam impurity and an extra hit caused by a shower particle from the absorber build a cluster (see Section 6.1),

\[\sigma_{M}=\tau_{0}\cdot\sigma_{A}+\sigma_{0}\cdot\tau_{A}+\sigma_{0}\cdot \sigma_{A}=(\tau_{0}+\sigma_{0})\cdot\sigma_{A}+\sigma_{0}\cdot\tau_{A}, \tag{3}\]

which is the same as

\[\sigma_{A}=\frac{\sigma_{M}-\sigma_{0}\tau_{A}}{\tau_{0}+\sigma_{0}}.\]

Equation (3) states that an event containing only single hits as extra hits occurs if either the beam is clean and the absorber produces a single hit or a beam impurity causes an extra hit and no shower particle from the absorber hits the chamber or both a beam impurity and a shower particle from the absorber produce an extra hit.

Correspondingly we have

\[\gamma_{A}=\frac{\gamma_{M}-\gamma_{0}\tau_{A}}{\tau_{0}+\gamma_{0}}.\]

Finally, the normalization condition \(\tau_{A}+\sigma_{A}+\gamma_{A}+\rho_{A}=1\) yields

\[\rho_{A}=1-\tau_{A}-\sigma_{A}-\gamma_{A}.\]

The results of the measurements of \(\tau_{A}\), \(\sigma_{A}\), \(\gamma_{A}\), and \(\rho_{A}\) are listed in Tables 2 to 4. The errors given there have been calculated - as everywhere in the analysis - with the error propagation law under the assumption, that the number of events belonging to an event class is Poisson distributed.

The probability of an event with extra hits varies from about 10 to about 30 percent depending on the experimental condition. In all cases, most of the eventswith extra hits contain only cluster hits. Events which contain only single hits besides track hits or both single and cluster hits are half as frequent as the others. The frequency of events with extra hits rises both with the absorber length and the muon energy, as expected. The results of the measurements with different discriminator thresholds agree within the statistical errors.

### Extra-Hit Distributions

After the investigation regarding the event classes we turn to the spatial distribution of extra hits. As before with the event classes, the influence of beam impurities on the extra-hit distribution must be calculated by means of the data for the set-up without an absorber in the muon beam.

For this, let \(h\) mark the spatial extra-hit distribution in an event with extra hits. In other words: if an event contains extra hits, \(h\) is the probability that a particular tube has detected an extra hit. An upper index marks the event class. There, \((1-\tau)\) means that an event with extra hits has been observed. A lower index specifies the experimental condition.

At first we do not distinguish between different sorts of extra hits, but just

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Condition & \(\tau_{A}/\%\) & \(\sigma_{A}/\%\) & \(\gamma_{A}/\%\) & \(\rho_{A}/\%\) \\ \hline \hline

between track hits and extra hits. In our notation, \((1-\tau_{c})h_{c}^{(1-\tau)}\) is the measured extra-hit distribution in the experimental condition \(c\). The factor \((1-\tau_{c})\), the probability for an event with extra hits under the condition \(c\), takes into account that extra hits are not detected in every event. So far as a shower particle produced in the absorber does not hit the same tube as a beam impurity, the equation

\[(1-\tau_{M})h_{M}^{(1-\tau)} = (1-\tau_{0})\tau_{A}h_{0}^{(1-\tau)}+\tau_{0}(1-\tau_{A})h_{A}^{(1 -\tau)}\] \[+(1-\tau_{0})(1-\tau_{A})\left[h_{0}^{(1-\tau)}+h_{A}^{(1-\tau)}\right]\] \[= (1-\tau_{0})h_{0}^{(1-\tau)}+(1-\tau_{A})h_{A}^{(1-\tau)},\]

holds, which leads to

\[h_{A}^{(1-\tau)}=\frac{1}{1-\tau_{A}}\left[(1-\tau_{M})h_{M}^{(1-\tau)}-(1- \tau_{0})h_{0}^{(1-\tau)}\right].\]

In the analysis of the test-beam data \(h_{M}^{(1-\tau)}\) and \(h_{0}^{(1-\tau)}\) are not measured directly, but the histograms \(H_{M}^{(1-\tau)}\) and \(H_{0}^{(1-\tau)}\) are the measured quantities. Statistical estimates of \((1-\tau_{M})h_{M}^{(1-\tau)}\) and \((1-\tau_{0})h_{0}^{(1-\tau)}\) can be obtained from these bar charts by dividing the entries of the charts by the number of events which enter the analysis of the given experimental condition. This number be \(N_{c}\) for the experimental condition \(c\). Finally one gets the formula

\[h_{A}^{(1-\tau)}=\frac{1}{1-\tau_{A}}\left[\frac{H_{M}^{(1-\tau)}}{N_{M}}- \frac{H_{0}^{(1-\tau)}}{N_{0}}\right].\]

The distribution \(h_{A}^{(1-\tau)}\) in the first tube layer, which is gained that way at 300 GeV muon energy with a 30 cm long iron absorber, is presented in Figure 5.

Extra hits are most frequent close to the muon. Their frequency decreases with increasing distance from the muon. The extra-hit distribution is rather broad, its standard deviation is about 10 tubes which corresponds to 30 cm. Since the distance of the absorber from the chamber is 60 cm, this means that the standard deviation of the angle between the muon and the detected shower particle can be as large as \(27^{0}\). The asymmetry of the extra-hit distribution is caused by the fact that the chamber is not completely orthogonal to the beam axis and, since the absorber is placed orthogonally to the chamber - the absorber's longitudinal sides are not quite parallel to the beam axis. If both rotations, the rotation of the chamber and the rotation of the absorber against the beam, are taken into account in the Monte-Carlo simulation later, a similar asymmetry is obtained.

We consider the standard deviation \(s\) and the total number of extra hits \(\widetilde{Z}\) - this is nothing else but the integral over the distribution - as characteristic numbers of the distributions. The measured values of these quantities are listed in Tables 5 to 7, separated by tube layer and experimental condition.

All extra-hit distributions have the same standard deviation, within the estimated errors. However, they differ in the total number of extra hits; it increases with the muon energy and the absorber length. For 300 GeV muons a saturation is indicated at 30 cm. The number of extra hits also decreases from the first to the third tube layer since low-energy shower-particles can be absorbed in the tube walls between the layers.

In order to complete the investigation of the extra-hit distributions we consider the spatial distribution of extra hits in events whose extra hits are only single hits and in events whose extra hits are only cluster hits.

If we follow our notation, \(h_{M}^{\sigma}\) is the single-extra-hit distribution for the measurement with an absorber in the muon beam. Under the previous assumptions the equality

\[\sigma_{M}h_{M}^{(\sigma)} = \tau_{0}\sigma_{A}h_{A}^{(\sigma)}+\sigma_{0}\tau_{A}h_{0}^{( \sigma)}+\sigma_{0}\sigma_{A}\left[h_{0}^{(\sigma)}+h_{A}^{(\sigma)}\right]\] \[= (\tau_{0}+\sigma_{0})\sigma_{A}h_{A}^{(\sigma)}+(\tau_{A}+\sigma _{A})\sigma_{0}h_{0}^{(\sigma)}\]

Figure 5: Extra-hit distribution in the first tube layer at 300 GeV muon energy with a 30 cm long iron absorber. Tube numbers are given with respect to the tube hit by the muon.

holds. This equation is equivalent to

\[h_{A}^{(\sigma)}=\frac{1}{(\tau_{0}+\sigma_{0})\sigma_{A}}\left[\sigma_{M}h_{M}^{ (\sigma)}-(\tau_{A}+\sigma_{A})\sigma_{0}h_{0}^{(\sigma)}\right].\]

In the experiment, \(\frac{H_{c}^{(\sigma)}}{N_{M}}\) is measured as estimator of \(\sigma_{c}h_{c}^{(\sigma)}\) so that we finally obtain

\[h_{A}^{(\sigma)}=\frac{1}{(\tau_{0}+\sigma_{0})\sigma_{A}}\left[\frac{H_{M}^{ (\sigma)}}{N_{M}}-(\tau_{A}+\sigma_{A})\frac{H_{0}^{(\sigma)}}{N_{0}}\right].\]

Analogously, the cluster-hit distribution is given by

\[h_{A}^{(\gamma)}=\frac{1}{(\tau_{0}+\gamma_{0})\gamma_{A}}\left[\frac{H_{M}^{( \gamma)}}{N_{M}}-(\tau_{A}+\gamma_{A})\frac{H_{0}^{(\gamma)}}{N_{0}}\right].\]

First, our discussion is devoted to the results of the measurement of the cluster distribution. The spatial distribution of cluster hits in the first tube layer in an event whose extra hits all are cluster hits is presented in Figure 6 for the case

standard deviation is not a good characteristic number of the distribution while the total number of hits remains meaningful. It can be found in Table 11 for the different experimental conditions. There is essentially only one single hit in a triple layer, and that independently from the muon energy and absorber length.

We close the paragraph about extra-hit distribution with this observation. Next, we shall compare the results of the measurements with different discriminator thresholds, but otherwise identical experimental conditions.

## 6 Comparison of the Measurement with Different Discriminator Thresholds

In order to compare the results obtained with different discriminator thresholds more quantitatively we introduce two new quantities. If a quantity \(Q\) was measured with the low and the high threshold in an experimental condition \(c\), we

calculate

\[\Delta Q:=\sum_{c}\left(Q_{c}^{low\ threshold}-Q_{c}^{high\ threshold}\right)\]

and

\[\chi_{Q}^{2}:=\sum_{c}\ \ \ \frac{\left(Q_{c}^{low\ threshold}-Q_{c}^{high\ threshold} \right)^{2}}{Var(Q_{c}^{low\ threshold})+Var(Q_{c}^{high\ threshold})}\]

where \(Var(Q_{c})\) is the estimated variance of the quantity \(Q_{c}\). If the results of the measurements are consistent with each other, one expects \(\Delta Q=0\) and \(\chi_{Q}^{2}=5\) since there are 5 experimental conditions in which data were taken with different thresholds and the expectation value of a \(\chi^{2}\) with 5 degrees of freedom is just 5. As \(\Delta Q\) and \(\chi_{Q}^{2}\) are random variables they deviate from their expectation values in practice; the standard deviation of \(\Delta Q\) is

\[\sigma_{\Delta\,Q}:=\sqrt{\sum_{c}\left[Var(Q_{c}^{low\ threshold})+Var(Q_{c}^{ high\ threshold})\right]}\]

and the standard deviation of a \(\chi^{2}\) with \(n\) degrees of freedom is \(\sqrt{2n}\) which equals \(\sqrt{2\cdot 5}\approx 3\) in case of \(\chi_{Q}^{2}\). We say \(\Delta Q\)_is consistent with 0_, if \(-3\sigma_{Q}\leq\Delta Q\leq 3\sigma_{Q}\); if \(0\leq\chi_{Q}^{2}\leq 5+3\cdot 3=14\), then \(\chi_{Q}^{2}\)_be consistent with 5_.1

Table 11: Total number of hits in the single-hit distributions at 100 GeV and 300 GeV with low threshold (l.thr.) and high threshold (h.thr.).

In advance we decide to distinguish four cases:

1. \(\Delta Q\) is consistent with 0 and \(\chi^{2}_{Q}\) with 5. In this case we assume that the results of the measurements with both thresholds are consistent and their errors are estimated correctly.
2. \(\Delta Q\) is consistent with 0, but \(\chi^{2}_{Q}\) is greater than 14. Then the results of the measurements with different thresholds are consistent, but their errors are underestimated, presumably by the factor \(\sqrt{\frac{5}{\chi^{2}_{Q}}}\).
3. Neither is \(\Delta Q\) consistent with 0 nor \(\chi^{2}_{Q}\) with 5. In case \(\Delta Q\) becomes consistent with 0 after multiplication of the error estimates with \(\sqrt{\frac{\chi^{2}_{Q}}{5}}\), we would think that the measurements with different thresholds yield consistent results whose errors, however, have been underestimated.
4. \(\chi^{2}_{q}\) is not consistent with 5 and \(\Delta Q\) remains inconsistent even after rescaling of the errors with \(\sqrt{\frac{\chi^{2}_{Q}}{5}}\). In that case the results of the measurements show a systematic deviation, and attention must be paid to their interpretation.

We had already mentioned, that the frequencies of the event classes which had been obtained with both discriminator thresholds agreed within errors. Hence the results are consistent with each other according to criterion 1. The first case also applies to the number of extra hits and the standard deviation of the extra-hit and cluster-hit distributions. Criterion 2 is valid in case of the number \(\widetilde{Z}\) of cluster hits; the error of \(\widetilde{Z}\) is underestimated by a factor \(\frac{1}{2.6}\) in the first tube layer, by a factor \(\frac{1}{3.1}\) in the second tube layer, and by a factor \(\frac{1}{3.6}\) in the third tube layer. The results obtained with different thresholds for the number of single hits are consistent according to criterion 1 in the first tube layer while criterion 2 applies to the corresponding results for the second and third tube layer; here the results are consistent with each other, their errors, however, are in fact 3.0 times greater than assumed in the second tube layer, and they are 2.4 times greater in the third layer. Criteria 3 and 4 never apply.

The results of the measurements are therefore insensitive to the choice of the discriminator threshold.

The problem that the errors of some quantities had been underestimated may be connected with the precision with which the absorber may be put into the same position that it had before the change of the threshold. For if the absorber is laterally shifted by a millimeter or rotated about 3 mrad about the vertical axis in the Monte-Carlo simulation, the Monte-Carlo prediction of the number of cluster or single hits changes by an amount which is of the same order of magnitude as the fluctuations observed between the measurements with the high and low discriminator threshold. Because of this observation we believe that our interpretation that the errors are underestimated is justified.

### Estimation of Systematic Uncertainties

The past investigation of the test-beam data is based on several assumptions whose limited validity involves systematic uncertainties in the results. How well these assumptions are justified and how strongly they influence the results, will be discussed in the present section. Since the assumption, that the absorbers do not clean the beam, seems to be most dared, we are concerned with it first.

Figure 8 shows the extra-hit distribution in the first tube layer with respect to the tube hit by the muon for the 300 GeV data with low discriminator threshold and no absorber in the muon beam.

The absorber covers the region shaded in the histogram. The left or the right neighbour of the tube which is crossed by the muon are hit in 3630, i.e. 2.3% of the recorded events. As each absorber covers half of the neighbours, the absorber can therefore clean \(\frac{1}{2}\cdot 3630\) of events,

Figure 8: Extra-hit distribution in the first tube layer at 300 GeV muon energy with no absorber in the beam for low-threshold runs. Tube numbers are given with respect to the tube hit by the muon. The shaded area is covered by the absorber. 36789 events enter this histogram.

at most, if the absorber were not 6 cm, but 4 m high such that it covered the drift tube along its full length. Therefore it would be incorrect to assume, that the absorber cleans 1.1% of the events, because the extra hits in the neighbours are distributed along the tubes in a similar way as in Figure 8 and are not restricted to the 6 cm long slice of tube which is covered by the absorber. Hence, only about \(\frac{3630}{36789}\approx 9.9\%\) of the extra hits in the neighbours of the tube hit by the muon fall into the area of the absorber. This means that, in the extreme case, the absorber purges 0.11% of the events which contain extra hits of beam impurities. Then one would have to add to \(\tau_{0}\) the value \(a:=0.11\%\) in the calculation of event-class frequencies. Not

\[\tau_{A}:=\frac{\tau_{M}}{\tau_{0}},\]

but

\[\tau_{A}^{\prime}:=\frac{\tau_{M}}{\tau_{0}+a}=\tau_{A}\cdot\frac{1}{1+\frac{a }{\tau_{0}}}=\tau_{A}\cdot 0.9986\]

would be the probability that the absorber causes no extra hit in the muon chamber. The systematic error entailed by the assumption, that the absorber does not clean the beam, is therefore 0.14% at the most, hence negligible. This proposition remains valid for the 300 GeV data with the high threshold and the 100 GeV data. We conclude: the assumption that the absorber does not purge the beam is justified.

Also the assumption that a single hit from the absorber and a single hit from a beam impurity do not build a cluster, is justified, as this happens in less than 0.05% of all events. This frequency can be estimated from the class frequency and the number of single hits in the tube layers under the assumption that the single hits are uniformly distributed over the tube layers.

Similarly seldom do a beam impurity and a shower particle produced in the absorber hit the same tube so that the assumption, this would not happen, is reasonable.

Another source of a systematic error may be the secondaries themselves which are created in the absorbers. These secondaries could spoil the reconstruction efficiency in the silicon telescope if they hit a silicon plane. There are means to check whether this really happens. For the data with no absorber in the beam were not taken in one go, but in bits of 80000 events before and after a run with an absorber in the beam. The reconstruction efficiency in the telescope before and after each absorber run agrees with the efficiency during each absorber run within the statistical errors. Therefore one can assume that the reconstruction efficiency in the silicon telescope is not affected by the presence of an absorber in the beam.

In short, the systematic uncertainties which follow from our assumptions are less than the errors of the measured quantities and can hence be disregarded.

Comparison with Monte-Carlo Predictions

As mentioned in the introduction, the main goal of the analysis is to check to what extend simulation packages predict the class frequencies and extra-hit distributions. The simulation of the experimental set-up is simplified by the fact that the investigation of the test-beam data always tells us which class and extra-hit distributions are caused by the absorbers. Due to that we can assume a clean muon beam in the simulation. It would be difficult to simulate the impurities of the muon beam in detail. Also, the finger counters do not have to be simulated since, with a clean beam, the cuts on hits in the finger counters just guarantee that the detected muons are restricted to a square of 33 mm length in front of the absorber; this point, however, has to be taken into account in the simulation. In addition, one may assume that showers are not produced in the finger counters. The silicon telescope can be left out as well, because it measures the muon track behind the muon chamber so accurately due its high spatial resolution that it is sufficient to record the parameters of the true muon track behind the chamber in the simulation. The absorbers are put to the same places in the simulation as in the experiment. The support of the absorbers is not simulated as it does not influence the class frequencies and extra-hit distributions by construction (see Section 3).

The principal difficulty in the simulation of the experimental set-up can be summarized in two questions: 1. How is the response of the drift tubes to electrons and photons? 2. What energy thresholds must be set for the creation of a shower particle in the simulation?

First, we describe the response of a drift tube to muons. Muons which traverse a tube at a distance from the anode wire less than 14.4 mm are always detected. On the remaining 200 \(\mu\)m up to the tube wall the detection probability decreases approximately linearly to 0 with increasing distance from the wire [8]. If electrons and positrons are not stopped in the tube walls, they ionize more gas atoms inside the tube than muons and, hence, are detected at least as frequently as muons. Although the detection probability of electrons and positrons close to the tube wall might therefore be greater than for muons, we use the same efficiency for electrons, positrons, and muons. Doing so we underestimate the extra-hit frequency in a tube by 0.7% in the worst case, if the tubes were 100% efficient at the tube walls. Photons cause a hit in a drift tube, if they free electrons in the tube wall or, much rarer, in the gas or the wire. The creation of electrons by photons is, of course, part of the Monte-Carlo simulation. Its accuracy, however, depends on the energy threshold above which electrons are created. But that is already part of the second question.

Electrons flying from the absorber to the muon chamber must have a minimum energy to penetrate the 400 \(\mu\)m thick tube wall. An electron of 311 keV kinetic energy has 400 \(\mu\)m range in aluminium. In order to detect the majority of electrons produced by photons in the tube wall, 100 keV instead of 311 keVis the energy threshold set in the simulation. The energy cut-off for photons is set to a lower value, it is set to 4.5 keV because we set the same range for all the particles as for electrons in the simulation.

According to these considerations the Monte-Carlo predictions of the class frequencies and extra-hit distributions caused by an absorber should not change if the energy threshold is lowered. Indeed do the predictions presented in the following sections vary only within their statistical errors if the cut-off is lowered. This shows that the results are insensitive to the creation of very low energy shower particles.

### A Comment on GEANT-3.21 versus GEANT-4.3.1

In the next section GEANT-4.3.1 predictions are compared with the test-beam results in detail. No extensive comparison with GEANT-3.21 is shown. This has two reasons: first of all, GEANT-4.3.1 is the completely rewritten GEANT library which should become the new standard simulation tool and needs to be tested against experimental data; second, according to the GEANT-4.3.1 manual the electromagnetic cross-sections are the same in GEANT-3.21 and GEANT-4.3.1. The authors verified this statement in two steps: to check that the cross-sections for the primary processes are the same, 100 GeV and 300 GeV muons were shot through a 100 \(\mu\)m thick iron sheet and the number of secondaries, their energy and momentum direction were recorded in front of and behind the sheet in the framework of both simulation packages. The results agreed within a few percent. After the confirmation of the equality of the primary cross-section the frequency of extra hits and the extra-hit distributions in case of 300 GeV and 10 cm iron were compared and they also agreed. It is therefore justified to continue only in the new framework of GEANT-4.3.1.

### GEANT-4 Predictions in Comparison with the Test-Beam Measurements

We are approaching the goal of our efforts, the comparison of the test-beam measurement with its Monte-Carlo prediction. As explained in the previous section, we shall only fall back on the GEANT-4.3.1 package for the predictions. The test-beam simulation programme MTGEANT-4 [9] was used. At first we shall consider the predictions themselves before we shall confront them with the experimental results. Twice as many events as recorded in the experiment were generated for all conditions.

Before, we should mention that the Monte-Carlo data where the muons fly through an absorber in front of the chamber are compared with those data obtained with no absorber in the beam. This is done to take into account that extra hits are also detected by the muon chamber in the second case since, now and then, the muons knock out electrons from the tube walls which hit tubes outside the muon track.

We begin with the prediction of the class frequencies summarized in Table 12.

The probability of an event with extra hits rises with increasing absorber length and muon energy. Half of the events with extra hits contains cluster hits only. At the same muon energy and absorber length, events with extra hits are rarer in case of aluminium than in case of iron as one expects from the size of the cross-sections of the primary processes, namely ionization and excitation of atoms, bremsstrahlung, and direct pair production; for all these cross-sections increase with the atomic number of the absorber material.This result is not obvious a priori, because not only are more shower particles produced in iron than in aluminium, but also more shower particles are absorbed.

Is this also true with the number of extra hits? Are more extra hits detected by the chamber if one replaces an aluminium absorber of equal length? The numbers in Table 13 confirm this conjecture. An event contains about 1.6 times more extra hits if the muons are shot through iron instead of aluminium. For aluminium and iron, the number \(\widetilde{Z}\) of extra hits grows with the absorber length and the muon energy. \(\widetilde{Z}\) decreases from tube layer to tube layer with increasing distance of the tubes from the absorber because secondaries are stopped by the tube walls. The standard deviation of all extra-hit distributions varies between 8 and 9 tubes; there is an tendency that they are smaller in the third than in the second tube layer and smaller in the second than the first tube layer.

A similar situation with the cluster hits - see Table 14. They are distributed around the muon beam with a standard deviation of about 9 tubes. In the third tube layer they do not scatter as strongly around the beam as in the first two layers where their distributions have about the same widths. In these two layers,

the number of cluster hits is about equal while it is lower in the third layer. In total, a bit less cluster hits than extra hits are observed in an event.

At long last the single-hit distributions. The number of single hits in the tube layers is listed in Table 15. In this table no clear dependence of these numbers on the absorber length or the muon energy is evident. Single hits are found least of all in the second layer followed by the third. Most of the extra hits are located in the first layer. The number of single hits in one triple layer of tubes is slightly greater than 1 on the average.

When we compare the Monte-Carlo predictions with the test-beam measurements we observe no big deviations. The Monte-Carlo calculation yields similar event-class frequencies as the test-beam measurement. Events with cluster hits are predominant within the events with extra hits in the simulation and the experiment. The number of all extra hits, of the cluster hits, and of the single hits is predicted at the right order of magnitude, the standard deviation of the total extra-hit and cluster-hit distributions agree with the measured ones within the bounds of the statistical errors.

We use the ratio \(R\) between the calculated and experimental quantities for the number of extra hits and the class frequencies in order to get a better idea of the quality of the Monte-Carlo simulation. For the sake of clarity we write down

where \(Q_{MC}\) is the value of the quantity \(Q\) predicted by the Monte-Carlo and \(Q_{exp.}\) its experimental value. If the quantity \(Q\) was measured both with the low and the high discriminator threshold, we take the arithmetic average of the two single measurements.

The ratio \(R\) of the class frequencies \(1-\tau_{A}\), \(\sigma_{A}\), and \(\gamma_{A}\) is shown in Figure 9. The Monte-Carlo calculation unmistakably tends to predict too many events with extra hits at 300 GeV muon energies for absorber lengths of less than 20 cm, namely by approximately 20%. At the same time, also the probability of events with cluster hits as only kind of extra hits is overestimated by about 30% while the probability of events whose extra hits all are single hits is predicted correctly. It is more difficult to judge the situation at 100 GeV muon energy. On the one hand the Monte-Carlo simulation overestimates the frequency of events with extra hits by about 20% there too, yet, on the other hand, the observed ratios deviate from the ideal value 1 by less than three standard deviations. Therefore, the conclusion that the Monte-Carlo simulation is not able to adequately reproduce the test-beam results seems to be rash. As \(R\) is, besides that, almost 1 for longer

absorbers at 300 GeV, the authors consider it appropriate to indicate the mean precision with which the simulation describes the experimental data. Averaged over both energies, taking into account the errors, it amounts to 7% in case of the probability of an event with extra hits, 7% in case of the probability of an event whose extra hits all are single hits, and 12% in case of the probability of an event which contains only cluster hits as extra hits.

Let us check the ratios \(R\) for the number of all extra hits in Figure 10!

Some values deviate from the nominal value 1 much more than expected from their errors. The observed mean deviation, however, is not unacceptably large, it is 7% on the average in the first tube layer, 11% in the second and again 7% in the third.

There is a similar constellation with the ratios of the number of cluster hits. In the first layer, the ratio \(R\) deviates from 1 by 5% on the average, in the second by 5%, and in the third by 4%. This can be seen in Figure 11.

The mean deviation of the ratios of the predicted and measured number of single hits in

Figure 12 is greater than before, namely 9% in the first, 9% in the second, and 14% in the third tube layer.

Judging the comparison of all measured quantities, i.e. of the class frequencies and the individual extra-hit distributions, the prediction is obviously not perfect. In comparison with the statistical errors of the measured points the observed deviations are too large. Unfortunately, there is no clear pattern in the deviations, which could indicate their origin. Without such a hint it is impossible to answer this question based on the present test-beam measurement. One should keep in mind that the shower production is a complicated multi-step process at the end of which its consequences are considered without the experimental knowledge of the intermediate steps.

A mean accuracy of the prediction of the class frequency and the number of extra hits of the order of 10%, however, is by far sufficient to reach the original goal of developing reliable track reconstruction algorithms with simulated data before the operation of the ATLAS detector. For the spatial distribution of extra hits is predicted in its shape in detail by the simulation over a wide range, as is underlined by Figure 13. There, at 300 GeV muon energy with a 5 cm long iron absorber, the spatial extra-hit distribution which is predicted by the simulation follows the experimental distribution in its shape. The shape of the extra-hit distribution decisively sets the strategy with which muon tracks are reconstructed. In this context it is unimportant whether events with extra hits are predicted with a 10% wrong frequency and whether these events are generated with 10% too many extra hits. This uncertainty merely limits the accuracy which can be achieved in the prediction of the reconstruction efficiency of an algorithm. Obviously, it does not limit the possibility of comparing algorithms with respect to their reconstruction efficiency.

We conclude that we are able to simulate the process of the electromagnetic shower production triggered by muons with an accuracy adequate for the aimed purposes.

## 8 Summary

Let us summarize all results! The muons produced in the ATLAS experiment have to pass a huge amount of matter, namely the calorimeter, before they are detected in the muon spectrometer. They may trigger electromagnetic showers on their way through the calorimeter, a part of which may lead to additional hits in the muon chambers. The production of extra hits can be simulated with GEANT. A GEANT-4 simulation of the shower production in 10 to 30 cm iron and aluminium absorbers at 100 GeV and 300 GeV muon energy was compared to experimental data taken at the H8 test beam in September 1999. The Monte-Carlo simulation is able to reproduce the frequency of extra hits, the shape and the multiplicity of extra hits observed in the test-beam experiment with an average accuracy of about 10%.
