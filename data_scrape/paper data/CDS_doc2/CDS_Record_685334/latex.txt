###### Abstract

The TRT closed-loop gas system needs a special control and monitoring functionality which should maintain a stability of gas gain in spite of unavoidable changes in gas composition and variation of environmental conditions (temperature, pressure etc.). We describe a prototype set-up for the Gas Gain Stabilisation System build and tested at CERN on which basic ideas for algorithms and functionalities were tested. The system is based on special counter - reference straw, where X-ray \({}^{55}\)Fe spectrum is measured. Preliminary results of the prototype reaction to rapid changes in working gas pressure and temperature are presented.

## 1 Introduction

The working gas (Xe/CO\({}_{2}\)/CF\({}_{4}\), 70/10/20) for TRT detector is provided by the recirculating closed-loop gas system. The purifying part of the system has been designed as to keep oxygen and other electronegative admixtures at sufficiently low level and remove other undesirable impurities.

The basic diagram of the gas system showing its main components is presented on the Fig 1.

Close to the TRT detector (in the experimental cavern) the piping is split into 80 individual, thin branches which distribute gas uniformly (balancing the flow in branches) to end-cap wheels and barrel modules. The working pressure in the detector will be few milibars above atmospheric pressure. To remove the heat dissipated in the electronics and detector, special cooling systems have been foreseen. But due to the complexity of the mechanical design the uniformity of the temperature is guaranteed to be kept within \(10^{0}\)C along any given straw in the detector. So we can expect quite substantial gas gain variations due to temperature differences in the detector.

The gas mixer, the CO\({}_{2}\) removal and purification systems will keep the mixture concentration on required level, CO\({}_{2}-10\%\pm 1\%\), CF\({}_{4}-20\%\pm 2\%\). The level of impurities resulting from severe conditions in which detector operates, can also vary due to the imperfections of purifying system and in-time degradation of cleansing media. All this changes - gas concentration, ambient pressure and temperature as well as concentration of impurities will influence the gas gain factor in the straws. To achieve the necessary performance of the detector functionality as the electron identifier, the gas gain should be kept at constant value. The dedicated system - Gas Gain Stabilisation System (GGSS) - has been designed, prototyped and tested. In this note preliminary results of the tests are presented.

## 2 Ggss - structure

The control of the gas gain variations will be executed by monitoring a performance of the straw proportional counters (the same construction as straws in TRT detector) located as close as possible to the gas inlet of the TRT (see Fig. 1 for details). Such a location results in small differential pressure between reference straws and the straws in main detector. Pulse height spectrum from the reference straw will be recorded by the set-up and processed to detect any variations in the peak position (the energy resolution and peak's shape will also be analysed as auxiliary parameters for the system crosschecks and possible way to detect systemmalfunctioning). The algorithm calculates from collected data a voltage needed to maintain peak position constant and transmits its value to the detectors HV system as so-called reference High Voltage (HV\({}_{\mathrm{ref}}\)).

The flow diagram of GGSS algorithm is shown on Diagram 1. and details are given in the text.

Diagram 1. Algorithm of GGSS. (HV, HV\({}_{\mathrm{ss}}\), HV\({}_{\mathrm{ref}}\), pp\({}_{\mathrm{s}}\), ppc, DV, App - are described in text).

The constant gas gain is kept by varying bias voltage of the reference straw.

The correct high voltage is determined in few steps:

* starting values for HV := HV\({}_{\rm s}\) and peak position pp\({}_{\rm s}\) are declared (being also 'default' values found from typical straw characteristics),
* for fixed high voltage, the spectrum of \({}^{55}\)Fe line is collected,
* pp\({}_{\rm c}\), energy resolution and skewness are calculated,
* spectrum is validated i.e. rejected or accepted basing on energy resolution and skewness
* is voltage needed to double the gas gain,
* required accuracy of peak position stabilisation),
* if \(\left|pp_{s}-pp_{c}\right|\leq\Delta pp\) the procedure results in HV\({}_{\rm ref}\) = HV,

The typical spectrum of the \({}^{55}\)Fe line obtained in the set-up is shown in the Fig. 3.

The value of doubling voltage (DV) was experimentally determined for three different straws (Fig. 4) and equals to 70V near the working point of TRT.

## 3 Accuracy requirements for GGSS

The value HV\({}_{\rm ref}\) given by GGSS is further recalculated in the DCS system for every section of the TRT detector supplied form separate HV power supply, basing on equation:

\(HV_{\it section}=HV_{\it ref}+\Delta T\cdot TC\cdot DV\)

where:

\(\Delta\)T - difference in temperature between section and reference straw,

TC - temperature coefficient of gas gain.

As defined in the Technical Proposal relative change in gas gain, A, of whole TRT should be kept below \(\left|\frac{\Delta A}{A}\right|\cdot 100\%\leq 5\%\). Taking into consideration that \(\Delta\)T, TC and DV are determined with some errors, we have estimated that relative change in gas gain in reference straw has to be below 1%. It means that HV\({}_{\rm ref}\) should be determined (and set) with precision better than 0.7 V.

## 4 Tests of the system prototype

The pressure of active gas and reference detector temperature were changed rapidly to observe the resulting behaviour of GGSS. Results for temperature variations are shown in Fig. 5.

The increase in temperature decreases the density of the working gas, which for fixed high voltage, leads to increase in gas gain what is observed as increase in peak position of \({}^{55}\)Fe line. The answer of stabilisation system is delayed due to the collection time of spectrum (5 min). During collection time temperature was also increasing (the pressure was kept constant). When the temperature becomes stable, system reaches the required pp\({}_{\rm s}\) in few steps (4 to 5). Time variation of applied HV corresponds to time variation of the detector temperature. The stabilisation system properly reacts to temperature changes.

The similar tests were performed for fixed temperature but for varying pressure. These results can be seen in Fig. 6. In this case the system also works properly.

## 5 Conclusion

The prototype of GGSS was built and tested. System properly reacts to changes in pressure and temperature of the reference straw keeping the peak position at constant value. The algorithm of stabilisation is considered to be correct. More detailed study on contribution to the error of HV\({}_{\rm ref}\) determination, of the different factors and errors (as determination of the peak position, thermal coefficient, doubling voltage, counting statistic, long term stability of electronic readout) are needed. The final system design has started, basing on results obtained from prototype.
