Abstract

The drift properties of six-barrel chambers installed on the H8 beam line have been studied. The chambers have been kept at constant gas fluxes for a period of more than one month and the data collected during this period of the 2003 run have been analyzed. The drift properties of each tube have been evaluated by means of the measurement of the maximum drift time. Particular emphasis is given to the study of the drift properties of tubes that are in different positions in the on-chamber gas distribution series. A clear dependence of the drift properties on the series position of the tubes has been observed. The dependence of this effect on time, temperature and position along the tube has been investigated. An attempt to give a quantitative explanation of the effect based on the permeability of the MDT end-plugs to water is performed. An approximated estimate of the impact of the effect on single tube resolution is derived.

## 1 Introduction

High-momentum final-state muons are among the most promising and robust signatures of physics at the LHC. To exploit this potential, the ATLAS collaboration has designed a high-resolution muon spectrometer with stand-alone triggering and momentum measurement capability over a wide range of transverse momentum, pseudo-rapidity and azimuthal angle[1]. To achieve this goal, very demanding requirements on the Muon system as a whole have been placed. A real-scale test of the ATLAS muon spectrometer has been setup since 1999 in the CERN north area on the H8 beam line. A general description of the setup and of the goals of this system can be found in Refs. [2][3]. This note is focused on the study of the long-term stability and uniformity of the drift properties of the Monitored Drift Tubes chambers (MDT) installed on the H8 beam line under stable gas flow conditions. In particular a detailed study of the drift time dependence on the position of the tube in the gas series is presented. A change in the drift behaviour of tubes that occupy different positions in the on-chamber gas series (referred to as "serial effect") was already reported in Ref.[4]. The analysis was based on a few runs collected in the year 2002. It was observed that the drift time was increasing along the tube series and that the effect was larger for tubes with smaller gas flow. This year we have taken data for a long period with stable gas conditions in order to perform a systematic study of this effect and try to have a better understanding of its origin and of its stability with time. It is important to have a clear estimate of what will be the size of this effect in "ATLAS like conditions" and which kind of corrective actions can be taken in order to reduce its impact on the MDT performance to a negligible level. In addition to that, the dependence of this effect on the hit position along the tube is also investigated, using the measurement of the second coordinate from RPCs.

The organization of the note is the following: in Section 2 a general description of the 2003 H8 setup is given, in Section 3 the analysed data sample and the experimental method used are described, in Section 4 the experimental results are given, in Section 5 more detailed studies on the origin of the effect and on its impact on MDT's performance are reported and conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

## 2 2003 H8 setup

The H8 muon setup can be subdivided into two parts: a barrel stand consisting of six large MDT chambers, installed on rails, reproducing the geometry of an ATLAS barrel sector (two BILs, two BILs and two BILs) and six End-Cap MDT chambers installed on three large frames reproducing the geometry of one End-Cap octant (EIL1 and EIS1, EML2 and EMS2, EOL3 and EOS3). In addition to that in the barrel stand the BML and BOL stations have also been equipped with their partner Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC). The RPC chambers have been equipped with prototype readout and trigger electronics that provides, in addition to trigger signals, the coordinates of the beam muons along the MDT tube direction. In the EC stand for most of the beam period one TGC (Thin Gas Chamber) triplet and two TGC doublets have been installed close to the EM stand. A schematic view of the 2003 muon H8 setup is shown in Figure 1 (geometry displayed with the PERSINT package[5]).

The trigger has been provided by two different types of scintillators: a coincidence between two small scintillators covering a surface of about 10x10cm\({}^{2}\) (hereafter referred to as 10x10) and a coincidence between two planes of large scintillators covering a surface of about 60x100 cm\({}^{2}\) (hereafter referred to as hodoscope). The 10x10 is used to trigger on the core of the H8 muon beam while the hodoscope (in coincidence with the 10x10 veto) is used to select muons in the beam halo and allows a larger coverage of the muon setup.

All the MDTs have been equipped with final chamber electronics with the exception of the Chamber Service Modules (CSM) that are still prototypes, very close to the final-design ones. The signals from each drift tube are amplified, shaped, discriminated and measured by the Octal-Mezzanine boards. Each mezzanine is able to readout 24 tubes. The CSMs collect the data from all the mezzanines of one chamber and send them to two prototypes of the Muon Read Out Driver via optical fibres. In total more then 3400 channels have been readout with this readout scheme.

The standard MDT gas mixture consists of 93% of Ar and 7% of CO\({}_{2}\) at a pressure of three bars absolute. The H8 gas system consists of one line of Argon and one of CO\({}_{2}\) that are mixed in the gas hut (first floor above the experimental area) by means of two mass flowmeters. These flowmeters can keep the flow of the two gas components constant with time at 1 per mill level. The mixture is then distributed to the experimental area via one single line from which separate inlet lines (one per chamber) are connected to the 12 MDTs. Each MDT is also provided of an outlet that is connected to a common exhaust line. The pressure on the exhaust line is kept at three bars via a system based on a valve controlled by a pressure regulator. Each MDT is equipped with a rotameter, which allows the control of the gas flow of the individual chambers. All the barrel chambers are equipped with serial gas system with the exception of one multilayer of the BML1 chamber that is equipped with a full parallel gas system. For this reason, the BML1 has

two separate gas lines for the two multilayers with two separate rotameters. All the End-Cap MDTs are equipped with parallel gas systems with the exception of the EOL3 chamber that is equipped with a serial gas system. There are two ways of serial connection: in the barrel chambers, triplets of tubes of the same layer are connected, while in EOL3 triplets consist of tubes of three adjacent layers.

In ATLAS the gas flow is foreseen to be at the level of one volume exchange per day (10% of fresh gas and 90% of recycled gas). The gas flows of the 12 MDTs have been kept, by means of the rotameters, to a value that corresponds, roughly, to half volume exchange per day. The rotameter readings during the analysed period were: 20 l/h for the BILs, 40 l/h for the BILs, 60 l/h for the BOLs, 10 l/h for the EIS1, 20 l/h for the EIL1, 60 l/h for the EML2 and for the EMS2, 20 l/h for the EOS3 and 40 l/h for the EOL3. The barrel rotameters have been calibrated[6] by means of mass flow meters and the result of this calibration is reported in Table 1.

## 3 Data Selection and Analysis Techniques

The analysis was performed on a selected number of runs collected from July 19\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\) to August 22\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) of the 2003 H8 test beam period, for a total of approximately 850 hours. The gas flow conditions during this period were kept constant and the events were triggered by the hodoscope.

Different problems, including problems with the beam (9 days from July 25\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\) to August 3\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\)) and lack of barrel chambers temperature monitoring (1.5 days starting from August 10\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\) afternoon), restricted the useful data-taking period to a total of 13 days. At least one run per day was selected from this period, resulting in a total of 14 runs with statistics ranging from 100 to 500 thousand events. Only data from the six barrel chambers were used.

A typical TDC time spectrum for a set of drift tubes in shown in Figure 2. The drift properties of each tube have been characterized by means of the observable \(\mathrm{t_{drift}}\)=(tmax - t0). This quantity, named maximum drift time, is related to the drift velocity and it has been shown to be very sensitive to changes in the drift properties of the tubes, such as variations of the gas mixture or presence of contaminants.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Chamber & \begin{tabular}{c} Rotameter reading \\ (litres/hour) \\ \end{tabular} &

\end{table}
Table 1: Calibration values of the rotameter readings for the barrel chambers. For the BML1 two separate rotameters have been used for fully parallel and serial multilayer.

The determination of t0 and tmax has been performed by a fit to the TDC time spectrum. The functional form used to fit the data is represented by a double Fermi-Dirac plus a constant term which describes the background, as shown in the formula:

\[f(t)=P_{{}_{1}}+\frac{P_{{}_{2}}\times(1.0+P_{{}_{3}}e^{(P_{{}_{3}}-t)/P_{{}_{4 }}})}{(1.0+e^{(P_{{}_{3}}-t)/P_{{}_{5}}})\times(1.0+e^{(t-P_{{}_{3}})/P_{{}_{6}} })}\]

where t0=\(P_{{}_{3}}\) and tmax=\(P_{{}_{6}}\).

In order to study the "serial effect" the tubes have been grouped on the basis of their position in the gas series. In the naming convention used in this analysis, the gas flows from tube 1 to tube 3 in each triplet.

To reduce the statistical uncertainty, time spectra from tubes in different layers have been added together. Additionally, only tubes with a value of the signal to noise ratio greater than 15 were considered. The noise ratio is defined as the number of the events in the in-time window divided by the number of the events it the out of time region on the right side of the spectrum.

For each run and for each chamber, the spectra of the drift tubes grouped by multilayer and tube type have been fitted. The accuracy of the statistical error has been verified by dividing some runs in two sub-samples consisting of odd and even event numbers.

The statistical errors on the measured drift times are much larger for chambers of type 1 with respect to chambers of type 2 because of the different beam illumination.

Figure 2: Typical TDC spectrum (BML2, multilayer 2).

The data were collected at different temperatures, as shown in Figure 3. All the drift times were normalized to a reference temperature (27 \({}^{\circ}\)C) by applying a correction according to the functional form \(\delta\)t\({}_{\mathrm{drift}}\) / \(\delta\)T(K) = -2.4 ns/K reported in [7]. The temperature of each tube was approximated with the temperature of the chamber to which the tube belonged. An example of the drift time dependence on the temperature before and after the correction is shown in Figure 4.

## 4 Experimental results

The values of the drift times for the six barrel chambers have been analyzed as a function of the data-taking time and fitted with a 1\({}^{\text{st}}\) order polynomial. The results, grouped by multilayer and tube type, are shown in Figure 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 for the BIL1, BIL2, BML1, BML2, BOL1 and BOL2 chambers respectively. Results for the BOL1, multilayer 2, have not been fitted due to very low statistics for that particular chamber. The reported errors are statistical only. From the \(\chi^{2}\) /ndf values it can be argued that the errors are underestimated by a factor 2 or 3, depending on the chamber, because of a spread of the drift times due to real variations of the chamber conditions in addition to statistical fluctuations.

Assuming no time dependence of the serial effect, the average drift time and RMS have been computed for each tube type, multilayer and chamber. The results are reported in Table 2 and shown in Figure 11.

The spread of the values of the drift times at short range in time, clearly visible in the Figures from 5 to 10, can be determined from Table 2. It is given by the RMS for chambers of type 2 for which the statistical uncertainty is negligible. It is between 1 and 2 ns.

A comparison of the average drift times shows that the response is uniform from chamber to chamber within \(\pm\)2+3 ns.

Concerning the response of different tube types in the same multilayer, a clear dependence of the drift time on the tube series position is visible for all the multilayers, with the exception of multilayer 2 of the BML1 chamber which is equipped with a fully parallel gas system. This will be discussed in more details in Section 5.

Table 2: Average drift time and RMS for each tube type, multilayer and chamber.

In order to check the time dependence of the "serial effect" the slopes of the 1st order polynomial fit have been extracted. They are reported in Table 3 and in Figure 12 as a function of chamber, multilayer and tube type.

The average value of these slopes is found to be \((0.0011\pm 0.0015)\) ns/h. The mean value is calculated weighting each slope by \(w_{i}=1/\sigma_{i}^{2}\), and the error is estimated with the formula:

\[\sigma^{2}=\frac{N}{N-1}\frac{\sum_{i}w_{i}(x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}}{\sum_{i} w_{i}}\]

where the statistical errors are used only as a relative weight.

It can be concluded that the slopes are compatibles with zero. The corresponding uncertainty on the variation per day is 0.04 ns.

mbar/month). From these measurements a constant increase of t\({}_{\rm drift}\) of the order of 5.5 ns/day is derived in the 'no gas flow' conditions. For a leak-tight chamber the main cause for a drift time change (at least in H8 conditions) is expected to be water contamination entering the drift region from the tube end-plugs. More details and further discussion of this result are given in Section 5.

Figure 13: **Measured t\({}_{\rm drift}\) as a function of time for the multilayer 2 of BML2 in no gas flow conditions.**

It is also important to check the drift time dependence on the coordinate along the tube. If some water vapor is entering from the end-plug the combination between the dry gas flow and the water diffusion could create some non-uniform distribution of this contaminant along the tube. If this is the case, what is observed in the analysis reported above is the average of this effect over the region covered by the trigger. This cannot exclude the fact that locally the effect could be larger. In order to perform this measurement the coordinate along the tube has been derived from the RPC digits. The region that has been explored is limited by the extension of the hodoscope trigger and by the region covered by the RPC readout electronics to about one meter.

The values of the t0 and tmax have been measured as a function of the coordinate along the tube. An example of the t0 dependence on this coordinate is shown in Figure 14. The slope is (18.0 \(\pm\) 1.3) cm/ns1. This dependence can be attributed to the propagation speed of the MDT signal along the wire. The values of the t\({}_{\rm drift}\) as a function of the coordinate along the tube are reported in Figure 15, Figure 16 and Figure 17 for BIL, BML and BOL chambers respectively. A linear fit is performed in order to check the dependence of  t\({}_{\rm drift}\) on the coordinate along the tube. The slopes are: (0.24 \(\pm\) 0.08) ns/m for BIL chambers, (-0.03 \(\pm\) 0.04) ns/m for BML chambers and (-0.22 \(\pm\) 0.55) ns/m for BOL chambers, where the estimated errors are statistical only. The values of the \(\chi^{2}\)/ndf of the fits indicate that uncertainties larger than the statistical estimated errors are present. Taking this into account, within the x range along the tube accessible to the present measurements, no dependence has been seen.

Footnote 1: This value has been confirmed by a measurement of the propagation speed of a signal along the tube performed at LNF by M. Beretta.

## 5 Interpretation of the effect and studies of its impact on the MDT's performance

From the results reported in Section 4 a clear dependence of the measured drift time on the tube position along the gas series ("series effect") is observed. A possible interpretation of this effect, which has been already suggested in the past [4, 9], is that some water vapor is entering from the End-Plugs (EP) of the tubes and it is accumulating in the gas mixture during its flow along the series: in each tube there is a resulting increase of water vapor corresponding to the contribution of two EP.

In this section four different issues are addressed. First of all, the GARFIELD[8] simulation is used to predict the impact of the presence of water on the MDT drift properties. In particular the dependence of \(\mathrm{t_{drift}}\) and of the drift velocity on the amount of water contamination in the gas mixture is computed. Using these predictions the experimental data of the different chambers on \(\mathrm{t_{drift}}\) are then translated into an equivalent \(\mathrm{H_{2}O}\) contamination and compared between the different chambers.

The hypothesis of water contamination coming from the tube EP is tested by computing the equivalent water flux per end-plug (referred to as EHF/EP) needed in the different chambers to obtain the values of \(\mathrm{H_{2}O}\) contamination deduced from the observed \(\mathrm{t_{drift}}\) pattern. If this hypothesis is correct, the amounts of the "serial effect" of the different chambers can be explained by the different gas fluxes with a unique value of the EHF/EP (assuming that all the end-plugs have the same water permeability).

Figure 17: **Measured \(\mathrm{t_{drift}}\) as a function of the distance from the EP for the BOL chambers.**As a third step, an attempt to estimate the impact of the effect on the single tube space resolution for the different type of chambers is performed. This is done on the basis of the GARFIELD simulation and crosschecked with the residuals of one of the run collected in 2003 (run 1559).

The last issue covered in this section is related to the computation of the expected water vapor flow from the end-plug on the basis of the water permeability coefficient of the NORYL and the actual end-plug geometry.

### GARFIELD computation

The GARFIELD simulation code has been used to study the impact of the water vapor contamination on the MDT drift properties. Different quantities of water vapor (50,100, 200, 300 and 400 ppm) have been added to the standard Argon-CO2 MDT gas mixture (93%-7%). An example of the GARFIELD predicted drift velocity as a function of the radius is given in Figure 18 for different contents of water contamination.

From the drift velocity as a function of the radius, _v(r)_, the corresponding drift time _t(r)_ can simply be obtained by the following integral:

\[t(r)=\int_{a}^{r}\ \frac{dx}{v(x)}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \text{Where $a$ is the wire radius.}\]

The maximum drift time t\({}_{\text{drift}}\) is simply obtained as t(r=1.46cm). The predicted change in t\({}_{\text{drift}}\) as a function of the water content is reported in Figure 19. A quite linear behavior is observed in the range 50 to 400 ppm of water. A fit to the points with a linear function gives a slope of 0.065 ns/ppm of water (or \(\delta\)t\({}_{\text{drift}}\)/\(\delta\)H\({}_{2}\)O = 6.5ns/100ppm). This value is in fair agreement with the value of 5.5 ns/100 ppm measured with last year data [4]. By using the GARFIELD slope the differences in t\({}_{\text{drift}}\) between tubes occupying different positions in the gas series, reported in Table 2, have been translated into differences in terms of water vapor content change.

Figure 18: Relative change of drift velocity as a function of the radius as predicted by GARFIELD for 4 different H\({}_{2}\)O contents added to Argon-CO\({}_{2}\) mixture: 100ppm (black), 200ppm (red), 300ppm (green) and 400ppm (blue).

### Comparison of the effect between different chamber types

The further step consists in the translation of the measured water content, derived from the "serial effect" drift time changes and the GARFIELD prediction, into an EHF from each tube end-plug. The assumption is that the mixture sees an increase of water correspondent to the EHF from two end-plugs when going from one tube of the series to the successive one. With this assumption the EHF will depend on the water content, estimated with the drift time measurements, and on the chamber gas flow that changes from one chamber type to another. If our assumptions on the origin of the effect are correct, the EHF of the different chambers should be the same since they are equipped with the same end-plugs. From the t\({}_{\text{drift}}\) measurements reported in Table 2 an average value of the drift time difference for successive tubes belonging to the same series and for different chamber types has been computed. It is assumed that the size of the serial effect is the same for all the multilayers of the same chamber type and these values are therefore averaged to obtain a single value. The BML1 parallel multilayer has not been used in this computation. The results are reported in Table 4.

The EHFs of the different chamber types are in good agreement. This observation is also in agreement with the hypothesis that the "series effect" can be explained with a constant water flux from the two end-plugs due to the NORYL water permeability. A further

check is provided by the data taken without flushing the chambers: these measurements can be translated into an equivalent water flux from the end-plugs under the assumption that the drift time variation is due mainly to this effect. From the rate of 5.5 ns/day reported in Section 4 an EHF of about 0.000309 (bar\(\cdot\)l/day) per end-plug is derived, slightly larger than the numbers reported in Table 4.

### Estimate of the impact of the serial effect on single tube space resolution

In order to estimate the impact of the "serial effect" on the single tube resolution some assumptions on the convergence of the r(t) auto-calibration procedure in presence of such an effect must be done. In this Section it is assumed that the difference between the three "effective" r(t) relations will be averaged out by the auto-calibration procedure so that the final r(t) would correspond to the average of the ones for tubes of type 1, 2 and 3. Under this assumption the r(t) relation of a serial multilayer will be similar to the one of tube of type 2. The other two kind of tube will have a "real" r(t) that is different from the auto-calibration one by the amount predicted by GARFIELD for the equivalent water-content difference between this tube and the tube of type 2.

With GARFIELD the two r(t) relations (the "real", i.e. with the right amount of water, and the "wrong", i.e. with no water) are computed and from their differences as a function of the drift radius an average bias and an RMS are computed.

\[\delta(t)_{\mbox{\tiny\it{xppm}}}=r(t)_{\mbox{\tiny\it{xppm}}}-r(t)_{\mbox{ \tiny\it{xppm}}}\]

\[Bias_{\mbox{\tiny\it{xppm}}}=\frac{1}{t\max-t0}\int\limits_{t0}^{t\max}\! \delta(t)_{\mbox{\tiny\it{xppm}}}\,dt\]

\[RMS_{\mbox{\tiny\it{xppm}}}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{t\max-t0}\int\limits_{t0}^{t\max} \!\delta(t)_{\mbox{\tiny\it{xppm}}}^{2}\,dt-Bias_{\mbox{\tiny\it{xppm}}}^{2}}\]

The values of the bias and RMS as a function of the water content are showed in Figure 20 and in Figure 21. From these two plots the extracted slopes for the Bias and for RMS are: bias \(-0.294\)\(\upmu\)m/(ppm H\({}_{2}\)O) and RMS \(0.245\)\(\upmu\)m/(ppm H\({}_{2}\)O). These Bias and RMS can be used to estimate the error that is caused by the use of the "wrong" r(t) relations (i.e., r(t) relation of tube of type 2 applied to tubes of type 1 and 3). The \(\delta\)t\({}_{\mbox{\scriptsize\it{drift}}}\) between two tubes of the series as measured in Section 3 is translated into an expected Bias and RMS for tubes of type 1 (third and forth column of Table 5). It is also assumed that the biases will average to zero (i.e., bias of tube of type 1 equal to \(-\)bias of tubes of type 3). Therefore the net effect of the "wrong" r(t) relation (i.e., due to the serial effect) will translate for tubes of type 1 and 3 into a smearing of size:

\[RMS(ubes1-or-ubes3)=\sqrt{Bias^{2}+RMS^{2}}\.\]Assuming that tubes of type 2 have the correct r(t) relation then the total contribution to the single tube RMS will be on average of the order of \(\sqrt[]{(}2/3)\) of this amount (fifth column of Table 5). The extrapolation of the effect to "ATLAS like" gas fluxes is reported in the last column of Table 5.

From this approximated study it can be concluded that the impact of this effect on single tube resolution is expected to be negligible at ATLAS gas-flow conditions, even in the worst case (BIL). As a crosscheck the residuals as a function of the drift radius have been studied for run 1559. The cores of the residuals distributions have been fitted to Gaussian

functions and the values obtained for the RMS are (65.1\(\pm\)07) \(\upmu\)m for BIL2, (62.6\(\pm\)0.6) \(\upmu\)m for BML2 and (65.0\(\pm\)0.6) \(\upmu\)m for BOL2. The residuals as a function of the tube type in the series have also been checked and no significant differences (i.e., larger then 15 \(\upmu\)m) have been found. It has to be stressed that residuals are not the same quantity as the single tube resolution, but there is a strong correlation between these two observables.

### Estimate of the expected EHF from the end-plug water permeability

The last aspect treated in this section is the estimate of the water flux from the tube end-plugs based on the known properties of the NORYL material used to build them. On this subject an ATLAS internal note was already published in the year 2003[9]. Here some more accurate numbers on the water permeability and some more realistic geometry model of the MDT end-plugs have been taken into account. For the NORYL type GFN3 used to build the MDT tube end-plugs the water permeability is (number extracted from[10]):

\[P_{w}=2.6cm^{3}\cdot\left(\frac{cm}{cm^{2}\cdot bar\cdot day}\right)\quad \text{at 25}^{\text{o}}\text{C}.\]

From this coefficient the expected water vapor flow (WF) per end-plug can be computed by taking into account the difference of partial pressures inside (dry) and outside the tube (\(\Delta\)P), the surface of the end-plug exposed to the gas (\(<\)S\(>\)) and the average end-plug length (\(<\!\ell\!>\)):

\[WF(cm^{3}\,/\,day)=P_{w}\cdot\Delta P\cdot(<S>/<\ell>)\]

On the basis of the end-plug drawing the external and internal exposed surfaces of the end-plug and the average length have been evaluated. The mean value of the two surfaces is 12cm\({}^{\frac{2}{2}}\) and the average length is 2.7cm.

From these geometrical properties of the MDT end-plug and by using the water partial pressure of 33.5mbar at 26\({}^{\text{o}}\)C (average temperature of the analyzed runs) and assuming a relative humidity of 60% the value of WF=0.000227 (bar liters/day) per end-plug is obtained. This has to be compared with the average value of 0.000204 (bar liters/day) extracted from the test beam data (under the assumptions described above). The agreement between this approximated estimate and the data is quite good.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|r|r|} \hline Chamber & \(\delta_{\text{drift}}\)(ns) & RMS \(<\)21\(>\) & Bias \(<\)21\(>\) & Total \(<\)123\(>\) & Total \(<\)123\(>\) \\ type & & (\(\upmu\)m) & (\(\upmu\)m) & (\(\upmu\)m) & “ATLAS \\  & & & & & flux” (\(\upmu\)m) \\ \hline BIL & 3.2 & 11.4 & -13.3 & 14.3 & 7.2 \\ \hline BML & 2.0 & 6.9 & -7.8 & 8.5 & 4.3 \\ \hline BOL & 1.9 & 6.5 & -7.3 & 8.0 & 4.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: In the first column the chamber type is reported. In the second column the average drift-time differences between two consecutive tubes of the same series are listed. In the third and fourth columns the expected RMS and Bias on the 1\({}^{\text{st}}\) tube r(t) relation, computed as described in the text, are given. In the fifth column the expected average deterioration on the single tube spatial resolution is reported. In the last column the same value is computed for “ATLAS-like” gas flows.

## 6 Conclusions

A systematic study of the drift behavior of six barrel MDT chambers kept in stable gas flow conditions for a period of about 35 days on the H8 beam line has been performed. The typical gas flow of the barrel chambers was of the order of half the one foreseen in the ATLAS experiment (\(\sim\)1/2 exchange per day). The t\({}_{\rm drift}\) observable has been used to study the drift properties of the six barrel chambers. Once corrected for temperature dependence the drift properties of the MDTs have shown to be stable at the level of 0.04 ns/day on long term base and at the level of 1\(\div\)2 ns level on short term time base. The chamber to chamber response uniformity is within \(\pm\)2\(\div\)3 ns. The "serial effect" has been deeply investigated and can be explained with a water contamination due to the NORYL end-plug permeability. From the collected data an equivalent water flux of the order of 0.0002 per End-Plug has been estimated; this flux is in good agreement between chambers of different type and with an approximate estimate based on NORYL-GFN3 characteristics. By using the GARFIELD simulation an estimate of the impact of this effect on the single tube space resolution has been computed and found to be negligible in ATLAS operating gas fluxes.
