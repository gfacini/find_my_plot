## 1 Introduction

The discovery of the Higgs boson in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [1; 2] was quickly followed by the direct observation of fermionic Higgs boson couplings. This observation was achieved in the \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) channel1 through a combination of results from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [3; 4]. Recently, the ATLAS collaboration published an update of the measurement of the \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section using the full Run 2 dataset, consisting of \(139\)\(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV [5]. This publication presents a measurement of the total \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section with an overall uncertainty of \(14\%\). The result of \(\sigma_{pp\to H\to\tau\tau}=2.94\pm 0.21(\mathrm{stat.})^{+0.37}_{-0.32}( \mathrm{syst.})\) pb is found to be in agreement with the Standard Model (SM) prediction of \(3.17\pm 0.09\) pb. A measurement of the cross-sections of the four main Higgs boson production modes, gluon-gluon fusion (ggF), vector-boson fusion (VBF), associated production with a vector boson \(V=W,Z\) (\(VH\)) and associated production with a top quark pair (\(t\bar{t}H\)), is also provided with overall observed uncertainties of \(35\%\), \(22\%\), \(60\%\) and \(120\%\) respectively. All measurements are in agreement with SM expectations. Measurements are also presented in the context of the Simplified Template Cross-Section (STXS) framework [6]. For these measurements a reduced version of the _Stage 1.2_ STXS scheme is used. All STXS results show good agreement with the SM expectations within observed precisions ranging from \(26\%\) to \(120\%\). The best sensitivity is associated to the measurement of the VBF + \(V(\to qq)H\) processes in the high jet multiplicity and high di-jet invariant mass phase space. Conversely, the poorest sensitivity is in the ggF + \(gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) measurement in events with high jet multiplicity, high di-jet invariant mass and Higgs boson transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(H)\)! 200 GeV due to large statistical, theoretical and experimental uncertainties.

Footnote 1: Charge conjugation will be implied throughout the rest of this note unless stated otherwise.

This note describes the extrapolation of the cross-section measurements outlined above to a HL-LHC scenario. For the extrapolation, the dataset considered corresponds to \(3000\)\(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. The extrapolation is performed using the same analysis strategy as the Run 2 analysis, with the results adjusted to reflect the effects of the HL-LHC's larger dataset, higher center-of-mass energy, better theory descriptions, improved measurements of reconstruction and identification efficiencies, as well as improved background estimations.

While a similar extrapolation based on a \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section measurement performed with a partial Run 2 dataset was presented in the Report on the Physics at the HL-LHC [7], significant changes to the analysis strategy and to the measurement granularity motivate the update presented in this note.

## 2 Measurement of \(H\to\tau\tau\) cross-sections using Run 2 data

This section presents an overview of the measurement of \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-sections using Run 2 data, which is the basis of the extrapolation to the expected HL-LHC dataset. It is described in more detail in Ref. [5].

### Categorization

Due to their large mass, \(\tau\) leptons can decay to both lighter leptons and quarks. Leptonic \(\tau\)-lepton decays are labelled as \(\tau_{\mathrm{lep}}\) and refer to the process \(\tau\to\ell\bar{\nu}_{\ell}\nu_{\tau}\), where \(\ell=e,\mu\). They are reconstructed as eitherelectrons or muons. Hadronic \(\tau\)-lepton decays, on the other hand, are labelled \(\tau_{\rm had}\), corresponding to \(\tau\to{\rm hadron(s)}\nu_{\tau}\). The visible decay products are in this case reconstructed as \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\). Measurements of the \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section are therefore made in three different channels: \(H\to\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm lep}\), \(H\to\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm had}\) and \(H\to\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\).

Each channel is further classified into one of three categories: Boost (targeting ggF events with Higgs boson transverse momentum above 100 GeV), VBF (in which the Higgs boson is produced alongside two jets with large separation in pseudorapidity2) and \(V({\rm had})H\) (\(VH\) events with leptonically-decaying vector bosons are considered in a separate analysis). The \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel additionally contains an all-hadronic \(t\bar{t}H\) category, which is orthogonal to the categories of the ATLAS \(t\bar{t}H\) multilepton analysis [8].

Footnote 2: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r\), \(\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). Angular distance is measured in units of \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{\left(\Delta\eta\right)^{2}+\left(\Delta\phi\right)^{2}}\). Rapidity is defined as \(y=(1/2)\ln[(E+p_{z})/(E-p_{z})]\), where \(E\) is the energy and \(p_{z}\) is the \(z\)-component of the momentum. Transverse momentum and energy are defined as \(p_{\rm T}=p\)\(\sin\theta\) and \(E_{\rm T}=E\sin\theta\), respectively.

The event selection corresponding to each production category and decay channel is based on the kinematics of the \(\tau_{\rm lep}\) and \(\tau_{\rm had-vis}\), the reconstructed di-\(\tau\) invariant, collinear and/or transverse mass, the fraction of the momentum that is carried by the visible decay products of the \(\tau\) leptons, as well as the jet and \(b\)-jet multiplicity of the event (where jets and \(b\)-jets are required to have \(p_{\rm T}>30\) GeV) and the amount of missing transverse energy (\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)). These selections aim to ensure optimal sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal and are also designed to be in line with the definitions of the STXS bins.

In the VBF, \(V({\rm had})H\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) categories, a set of Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) [9] is introduced to enhance the signal contributions. In the case of \(V({\rm had})H\) the BDT is used to discriminate the process of interest from other Higgs boson production modes, while in the VBF category a BDT is trained to discriminate against the ggF production mode and the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) background. Finally, in the \(t\bar{t}H\) category two BDTs are used to discriminate against \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\to\tau\tau\) backgrounds.

### Background estimation

The main backgrounds in this measurement are the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) process, contributions from events with objects misidentified as one of the selected leptons and, in the \(t\bar{t}H\) category, processes involving top quarks. Their estimation is described below. All other background predictions are obtained directly from Monte Carlo simulation.

The \(Z\to\tau\tau\) process is the dominant background in most channels of the \(H\to\tau\tau\) analysis, representing between 70 and 90% of the overall background contributions in the various signal regions. A detailed and accurate description of this contribution is therefore required for precise \(H\to\tau\tau\) measurements. However, the similarity between the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) and \(H\to\tau\tau\) processes makes it difficult to create control regions where the \(Z\) process can be studied in detail and where its modelling can be assessed within a phase space relevant to the analysis. For this reason, a parametrized version of the embedding method [10] was introduced, wherein control regions targetting \(Z\to ee\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) are used to study the \(Z\) background. This method, described in more details in Ref. [5], consists in the scaling of the momentum of the leptons from \(Z\to ee\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) in order to replicate the kinematics expected from \(Z\to\tau\tau\) events. This allows the modelling and normalization of the \(Z\) process to be assessed within a phase space that matches the one from the \(H\to\tau\tau\) analysis. Uncertainties related to the embedding procedure are included in the analysis and account for the non-closure of the method.

Background contributions from events with objects misidentified as electrons, muons and \(\tau_{\rm had\mbox{-}vis}\) (jointly called the misidentified \(\tau\) background) are also estimated using data-driven methods. In the \(\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm lep}\) channel, the matrix method [11] is used while in the \(\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm had}\) and \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) channels the fake factor method [12] is chosen. Uncertainties are also included for the matrix method and fake factor estimates; they consist in statistical uncertainties from the limited amount of events in the control regions and Monte Carlo simulations as well as residual mismodelling effects from the method, effects of the flavour composition in the control regions and effects of the kinematic dependence of the estimates.

Finally, the contributions from the top-quark background are studied in dedicated control regions where the normalization of this contribution is also determined.

### Statistical analysis

The \(H\to\tau\tau\) signal is extracted from a fit to 32 signal regions, defined as follows and illustrated on the right side of Figure 1:

* 2 \(t\bar{t}H\) signal regions, one enriched in \(H\to\tau\tau\) events (labelled ttH_1) and one with a higher rate of background events (labelled ttH_0), for the \(\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\) channel only, as defined by the BDT score of the events.
* 6 VBF signal regions, consisting of a region enriched in VBF events (labelled VBF_1) and one with a lower purity of VBF events (labelled VBF_0) for each of the three decay channels, again defined according to the BDT score of the events.
* 6 \(V({\rm had})H\) signal regions, similarly defined as VH_1 and VH_0 in each of the three decay channels.
* 18 Boost signal regions, consisting of six jet multiplicity and Higgs transverse momentum bins for each of the three decay channels (see Figure 1).

The main variable of interest used for the fit in these regions is the mass of the di-\(\tau\) system, and it is computed using the Missing Mass Calculator algorithm [13].

A total of 36 control regions are also included to constrain the normalization of some of the main backgrounds:

* 30 embedded \(Z\to\ell\ell\) control regions, one for each of the signal regions defined above except for the \(t\bar{t}H\) signal regions (the normalization of the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) process is left to float freely in the two \(t\bar{t}H\) signal regions through a shared normalization factor).
* 6 top control regions, consisting of control regions in the Boost, VBF and \(V({\rm had})H\) phase spaces for the \(\tau_{e}\tau_{\mu}\) and \(\tau_{\rm lep}\tau_{\rm had}\) decay channels (the normalization of top-quark processes is again left to float freely in the two \(t\bar{t}H\) signal regions through a shared normalization factor).

Three different types of fits are peformed, with different parameters of interest. In all cases the fits are performed with the constraint of the Higgs boson's rapidity \(|y_{H}|<2.5\) and make use of all the signal and control regions defined above. The first fit aims to measure the inclusive \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section. In this case, the relative contributions from the various production modes are fixed to the SM predictions, and the signal yields in each category are parametrized using the total \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section as a single parameter of interest. The second fit aims to measure the four main production mode cross-sections, and is therefore performed using four different parameters of interest: one for ggF, one for VBF, one for \(VH\) and one for \(t\bar{t}H\). Lastly, in the third fit, the measurement in STXS bins is performed by matching each of the signal regions of the analysis to one of the STXS bins resulting in 9 distinct parameters of interest, as illustrated in Figure 1.

### Expected results

#### 2.4.1 Inclusive \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section

For the inclusive \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section measurement, the expected3 result achieves a precision of 13%. The contributions from the various sources of uncertainty are shown in detail in Section 3. Overall, the largest effects come from theoretical uncertainties on the signal prediction as well as from the experimental uncertainties related to jets and missing transverse energy, and from uncertainties arising from the finite size of the background samples.

Footnote 3: For expected results, fits are performed assuming that all processes are perfectly modeled by the signal and background predictions. Control regions are used to additionally constrain the size of the various sources of uncertainty. This is in contrast to the observed results presented in Section 1.

The relative contributions to each event category from the two most dominant STXS bins are indicated by the two colours used along the width of the category box. Figure from Ref. [5].

#### 2.4.2 Production mode cross-sections

Cross-section measurements are performed for the four main production modes separately. The results correspond to an expected precision of 40%, 20%, 60% and 120% on the cross-section measurements of ggF, VBF, \(VH\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) respectively. For ggF, large contributions from systematic uncertainties limit the precision of the measurement. In particular, the theoretical uncertainties on the signal have a large impact. For VBF, the contributions from systematic uncertainties and from the data sample size have a similar impact. Finally, the precision of the \(VH\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) measurements is limited by large uncertainties from the finite data sample size.

#### 2.4.3 Cross-section measurements in STXS bins

The last set of measurements is performed in a simplified version of the _Stage 1.2_ STXS scheme. The most precise measurement is performed within the bin sensitive to electroweak processes (\(\text{VBF}+V(\to qq)H\)) in a phase space with at least two jets and with a di-jet invariant mass above 350 GeV, with a total expected uncertainty of 22%. For the \(\text{ggF}+gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) processes, the bins where the Higgs boson transverse momentum is between 200 and 300 GeV, and above 300 GeV are also associated to smaller total expected uncertainties, corresponding to 40% and 50% respectively. The least precise measurement corresponds to that of the \(\text{ggF}+gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) bin with at least two jets, a di-jet invariant mass above 350 GeV and Higgs boson momentum below 200 GeV, with a total expected uncertainty of 180%. The contributions from systematic uncertainties and uncertainties due to the data sample size vary significantly across the measured bins. Large uncertainties due to the data sample size are present in particular in the well-measured electroweak bins, and in both \(\text{ggF}+gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) bins where the Higgs boson has transverse momentum above 200 GeV. The \(t\bar{t}H\) bin also suffers from large statistical uncertainties due to the limited data sample size.

## 3 Extrapolation procedure

The extrapolation of the Run 2 results to the HL-LHC expectation takes into account the total integrated luminosity, the center of mass energy and expected size of various sources of uncertainty at the HL-LHC through a scaling procedure.

In particular, the signal and background yields from the Run 2 analysis are scaled to account for the increase of the integrated luminosity from 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) at the end of Run 2 to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) by the end of the HL-LHC programme.

Similarly, a scaling is introduced to correct the cross-sections of the various processes of interest from their values at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV in Run 2 to their expected values at 14 TeV at the HL-LHC, considering the change in quark and gluon luminosities between 13 TeV and 14 TeV. The scaling values are shown in Table 1.

The size of the theoretical and experimental uncertainties is also scaled to reflect the better understanding and higher performance of the ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC, based on the investigations outlined in Ref. [14]. All uncertainty components originating from statistical uncertainties due to the size of the data sample, such as the statistical error on the misidentified \(\tau\) estimates, are scaled to reflect the change in integrated luminosity. The uncertainty related to the finite size of Monte Carlo background samples is alsoreduced under the assumption that the size of these samples will increase proportionately to the integrated luminosity4. It is assumed that the measurement of the luminosity can be achieved within a precision of 1.0% at the HL-LHC, whereas the current precision is 1.7%. Experimental uncertainties related to the triggering, reconstruction, identification and calibration of the various considered objects are also scaled when relevant. In particular, the uncertainties on the energy scale and resolution of the missing transverse momentum are reduced by a factor of two, while those on the energy scale and resolution for particle flow jets are left unscaled. The uncertainties related to the identification of heavy-flavour (\(b\), \(c\)) jets using the DL1r \(b\)-tagging algorithm are scaled down by a factor of two, while the uncertainty assigned to light-flavour jets mis-identified by the algorithm are kept at their Run 2 values. All uncertainties related to leptons (\(e\), \(\mu\), \(\tau_{\rm had\-vis}\)) remain at their Run 2 values. The analysis-specific uncertainty on the parametrized embedding procedure is reduced by a factor of two. Finally, all theoretical uncertainties are reduced by a factor of two. This includes uncertainties on the cross-sections of the processes of interest5, on the value of \(\alpha_{S}\), on the factorization, renormalization and resummation scales, on the parton distribution function and shower models, on the chosen merging scheme, and on the description of the initial and final state radiation. The uncertainty scalings are summarized in Table 2.

Footnote 4: A second scenario where the size of the Monte Carlo background samples is large enough to have a negligible impact on the final result is also considered. Where relevant, results obtained for this scenario are highlighted with a *.

Footnote 5: For signal theory uncertainties, note that cross-section measurements are not affected by uncertainties that impact only the total signal yield. However, signal cross-section uncertainties that impact the acceptance into the various signal regions and those that affect the shape of the \(m_{\tau\tau}^{\rm MMC}\) distribution remain relevant and are therefore considered here.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline \hline Process & Scale factor value \\ \hline ggF & 1.13 \\ VBF & 1.13 \\ \(VH\) & 1.10 \\ \(t\bar{t}H\) & 1.21 \\ \(b\bar{b}H\) & 1.14 \\ \(tH\) & 1.21 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\), single top & 1.16 \\ \(VV\), \(Z\to\tau\tau\), \(Z\to\ell\ell\) & 1.10 \\ Misidentified \(\tau\) background & 1.10 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 4 Results

The results outlined here follow the stucture of the ones presented in Section 2 for the Run 2 analysis. Only expected results, in which the fit is performed under the assumption that all processes are modeled by the signal and background predictions, and in which control regions are used to provide additional constraints on the size of the sources of uncertainty, are compared.

### Inclusive \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section

At the HL-LHC, the inclusive \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section measurement is projected to have a precision of 5%, corresponding to a value of \(\sigma(pp\to H\to\tau\tau)_{\text{exp}}/\sigma(pp\to H\to\tau\tau)_{\text{SM}}=1.00\pm 0.05=1.00\pm 0.01(\text{stat.})\pm 0.04(\text{sig. th.})\pm 0.02(\text{syst.})\). This result is also studied in a second scenario, where the size of Monte Carlo samples is considered to be large enough that its impact is negligible6. This second scenario results in a very similar measurement precision, as outlined in Table 3. In both cases, the dominant source of uncertainty comes from theoretical uncertainties on the signal prediction as shown in the same table in a comparison to the Run 2 result.

Footnote 6: Part of the impact of statistical uncertainties on the estimation of misidentified \(\tau\) backgrounds is due to the data sample size. This part is therefore independent of the size of the Monte Carlo samples and still contributes to the background sample size uncertainty for the HL-LHC* scenario.

\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline Uncertainty & Scale factor value & Comment \\ \hline Data sample size\({}^{\dagger}\) & 0.22 & Scaling from 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) \\ Background samples size\({}^{\dagger}\) & 0.22 & Scaling from 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) \\ Luminosity & 0.59 & Scaling from 1.7\% to 1.0\% \\ \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) & 0.50 & \\ Jets & 1.00 & Unscaled \\ Flavour tagging (\(b\), \(c\)) & 0.50 & \\ Flavour tagging (light) & 1.00 & Unscaled \\ Electrons and muons & 1.00 & Unscaled \\ Hadronic \(\tau\) decays & 1.00 & Unscaled \\ Non-closure of embedding method & 0.50 & \\ Theoretical uncertainties & 0.50 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Production mode cross-sections

The projected precision of the four production mode measurements is presented in Figure 2 for the HL-LHC; the projected precision of the combined measurement is also presented for completeness. The projected values are 11%, 7%, 14% and 24% for ggF, VBF, \(VH\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) respectively, which corresponds to the observation of all production modes except for \(t\bar{t}H\), where the significance reaches 4.4\(\sigma\). Theoretical uncertainties on the signal prediction dominate the uncertainty for the ggF and VBF projections, while in the \(VH\) projection there are similar contributions from experimental uncertainties and uncertainties coming from the data sample size. For the \(t\bar{t}H\) projection, the largest impact is from the various experimental uncertainties, although closely followed by theoretical uncertainties on the signal prediction and from the data sample size. In all cases systematic uncertainties have a larger contribution than the statistical ones from the data sample size. These results are also presented in a comparison to their Run 2 counterparts and to the current and projected theoretical uncertainties in Figure 3 and in table form in Appendix A.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline Source of uncertainty & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Impact on \(\Delta\sigma/\sigma(pp\,\rightarrow\,H\,\rightarrow\,\tau\tau)\) [\%]} \\  & Run 2 & HL-LHC & HL-LHC* \\ \hline Theoretical uncertainty on the signal & 8.5 & 3.8 & 3.7 \\ Jet and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) & 4.2 & 1.7 & 1.7 \\ Background sample size & 3.7 & 1.3 & 0.9 \\ Hadronic \(\tau\) decays & 2.1 & 0.9 & 0.9 \\ Misidentified \(\tau\) & 2.0 & 0.7 & 0.7 \\ Luminosity & 1.8 & 0.7 & 0.7 \\ Theoretical uncertainty in \(Z\,\mathrm{+\,jets}\) processes & 1.2 & 0.7 & 0.7 \\ Theoretical uncertainty in Top processes & 1.1 & 0.3 & 0.3 \\ Flavour tagging & 0.5 & 0.2 & 0.3 \\ Electrons and muons & 0.4 & 0.3 & 0.3 \\ \hline Total systematic uncertainty & 11.4 & 4.4 & 4.3 \\ Data sample size & 6.7 & 1.3 & 1.3 \\ Total & 13.2 & 4.6 & 4.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

A scenario in which the Monte Carlo background sample size is sufficiently large that its contribution as a systematic uncertainty is negligible is also included and labelled as HL-LHC*. The expected fractional impacts of the various sources of uncertainty, computed by the fit, are given, relative to the \(\sigma(pp\,\rightarrow\,H\,\rightarrow\,\tau\tau)\) value. Experimental uncertainties in reconstructed objects combine efficiency and energy/momentum scale and resolution uncertainties. Background sample size includes the bin-by-bin statistical uncertainties in the simulated backgrounds as well as statistical uncertainties in misidentified \(\tau\) backgrounds, which are estimated using data.

The precision of the combined result for the inclusive cross-section, also scaled to its expectation value, is included at the bottom. The uncertainty on the predicted signal cross-section for each production mode, illustrating the current and projected HL-LHC precision of theory calculations, is also shown.

The combined (inclusive) measurement is also shown for completeness. Both total and statistical-only uncertainties are shown. The uncertainty on the predicted signal cross-section in each bin, corresponding to the foreseen precision of theory calculations at the HL-LHC, is also included.

### Cross-section measurements in STXS bins

The cross-section measurement projections within the STXS framework are shown in Figure 4. The most sensitive projected measurements are the VBF + \(V(\rightarrow qq)H\) cross-section in events with at least two jets and a di-jet invariant mass of at least 350 GeV (VBF topology), with an uncertainty of 7%, and the ggF + \(gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) cross-section in events with Higgs boson transverse momentum between 200 and 300 GeV, with an uncertainty of 10%, and above 300 GeV, with an uncertainty of 11%. The last two are expected to be some of the most sensitive measurements of Higgs boson production in that momentum range possible at the HL-LHC. All other STXS bins are projected to have uncertainties below 25% except for the bin corresponding to ggF + \(gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) events with at least two jets, di-jet invariant mass above 350 GeV and Higgs boson transverse momentum below 200 GeV, which is expected to reach a precision of around 50%. These results are also shown in Figure 5 in a comparison to the Run 2 measurements and to the current and projected theoretical uncertainties, and are available in table form in Appendix B.

Figure 4: HL-LHC projection for the expected precision of the various STXS \(H\rightarrow\tau\tau\) measurements scaled to their SM expectation values. Both total and statistical-only uncertainties are shown. The uncertainty on the predicted signal cross-section in each bin, corresponding to the foreseen precision of theory calculations at the HL-LHC, is also included.

All of these projections are also produced with the assumption of very large Monte Carlo samples (scenario HL-LHC*). The effect of this second scenario is noticeable in some bins, such as the bin for ggF + \(gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) events with Higgs boson transverse momentum between 60 and 120 GeV, where the total uncertainty is reduced by 7%. In other bins, like the one associated to ggF + \(gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) events with at least two jets, di-jet invariant mass above 350 GeV and Higgs boson transverse momentum below 200 GeV, the total uncertainty is only reduced by 2.7% when moving to this scenario. Detailed results for the HL-LHC* scenario are available in Appendix B.

## 5 Conclusion

The expected precision of the measurement of Higgs boson production processes in events with \(H\to\tau\tau\) decays at the HL-LHC is derived from an extrapolation of the results obtained with the full Run 2 dataset. This extrapolation takes into account the increase in center-of-mass energy to 14 TeV, the size of the HL-LHC dataset (3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)), as well as the expected evolution of the impact of various sources of uncertainty. The inclusive \(pp\to H\to\tau\tau\) cross-section measurement is expected to reach a precision of approximately 5%, while the precision of the measurements of the ggF, VBF, \(VH\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) production modes is expected to reach 11%, 7%, 14% and 24% respectively. Measurements are also presented within _Stage 1.2_ of the STXS framework. The precisions in this case are expected to range from 7% in VBF topologies to 50% in ggF + \(gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) events with at least two jets, high di-jet invariant mass and \(p_{\rm T}(H)\) < 200 GeV. STXS measurements for \(H\to\tau\tau\) events with high Higgs boson transverse momentum within ggF + \(gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) topologies are expected to reach precisions of approximately 10%, significantly contributing to Higgs boson measurements in this kinematic regime.

Table 7: Expected precision of the STXS ggF \(+gg\to Z(\to qq)H\) production mode measurements for the \(H\to\tau\tau\) Run 2 analysis and the HL-LHC and HL-LHC* extrapolations. The spade symbol (\(\bullet\)) indicates that the criteria for \(m_{jj}\) only apply to events with at least two reconstructed jets. The expected fractional impact of the total uncertainty, computed by the fit, is given relative to the \(\sigma(pp\,\to\,H\,\to\,\tau\tau)\) value.
