an extension of the BML rails. Any larger opening would require rail extensions to be mounted after the radial shift of the EEL.2 chamber.

In the BIL layer only the outermost chamber is moved. There is only about 680 mm free space for the movement of the BIL.6 chamber before it interferes with the EIL.4 chamber. Therefore the BIL.6 chamber in sector 13 has been shortened by 180 mm, leaving a gap of 200 mm towards BIL.5 and a total opening of 870 mm when BIL.6 is retracted. This gap serves at the same time as passage for the support legs of the access platform to the voussoir below. We propose to fix the permanent platform on the other side to the tile calorimeter structure such that no passage through the BIL chamber layer is required on that side. Provisions must be taken that the support legs of the platform can be temporarily removed. This is required to grant access to the BIS chambers which can only be reached by creating openings in the BIL chambers (hopefully not too often) by sliding them on the rails. Such a movement is blocked for the first 5 BIL chambers in sector 13 by the platform support legs.

We do not plan for any movement of the BIS chambers.

## 3 Other openings

If an opening in a second sector is required the proposed scheme can be adapted to the requirements. No problem is foreseen for the BML chambers. Clearly the EEL.2 chamber of the corresponding sector would have to be made radially movable.

Also for the BIL layer no big problems are foreseen provided there are no service lines which would block a major fraction of the space between the BIL and EIL chambers. It should be noted, however, that the shortening of the BIL.6 chamber is only proposed for sector 13; the BIL opening would be restricted to 680 mm in the other sectors.

For the BOL layer an extension of the BOL rails into the space exceeding the barrel toroid may be difficult in the other sectors.

## 4 Conclusions

We think that an access principle through the muon chambers of the bottom sector as proposed by the ATLAS Technical Coordination is feasible with the proposed muon chamber layout. We would like to recall that any movement of chambers requires a disconnect of the chambers or flexible service lines, both of which we try to limit as much as possible. Any movement of end-cap chamber requires in addition some moving mechanism and probably more space for their support structure. It is for this reason that we would like limit the moving of chamber to the absolutely necessary.
