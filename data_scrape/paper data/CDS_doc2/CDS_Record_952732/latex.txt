**Abstract**

We study the sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to the measurement of angular distributions and asymmetries in \(t\bar{t}\) decays. We consider semileptonic decays of the top quark pair produced at LHC, with \(t\to W^{+}b\), \(\bar{t}\to W^{-}\bar{b}\), one of the \(W\) bosons decaying leptonically and the other hadronically. Several event analysis and reconstruction procedures are examined, finding that a convenient choice of the reconstruction method can significantly reduce systematic uncertainties. The most relevant angular asymmetries studied can be measured with a precision ranging from 0.4% to 15%.

The three generation structure of the standard model (SM) was completed with the discovery of the top quark at Tevatron [1]. With a mass around 175 GeV, the top is the heaviest and least studied quark. Although its properties have already been investigated at colliders [2, 3, 4], the available centre of mass (CM) energy and the collected luminosity have not allowed for precise measurements except of its mass. The determination of other fundamental properties, like electric charge, spin and couplings, requires larger top samples, which will be available at Tevatron Run II and LHC. In its first low luminosity (10 fb\({}^{-1}\) / year) phase, LHC will produce several millions of top quarks per year and experiment, mainly in pairs through gluon fusion \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) and quark-antiquark annihilation \(q\bar{q}\to t\bar{t}\), with a total cross section of 833 pb [5]. Single top production [6, 7] will also occur, dominated by the process \(bq\to tq^{\prime}\), with an expected cross section of 306 pb [5]. These and other processes will test the SM predictions for the fundamental properties of the top quark, and in particular they will allow us to measure its couplings [6, 8, 9, 10, 11]. This fact is specially important since, from a theoretical point of view, sizeable deviations from the SM predictions for top couplings are possible in several SM extensions.

Here we concentrate ourselves on the \(Wtb\) vertex. Within the SM this coupling is purely left-handed, and its size is given by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element \(V_{tb}\). In SM extensions, departures from the SM expectation \(V_{tb}\simeq 0.999\) are possible [12, 13], as well as new radiative contributions to the \(Wtb\) vertex [14, 15]. These deviations might be observed in top production and decay processes at LHC. Top pair production takes place through QCD interactions without involving a \(Wtb\) coupling. Additionally, it is likely that the top quark almost exclusively decays in the channel \(t\to W^{+}b\). Therefore, its cross section for production and decay \(gg,q\bar{q}\to t\bar{t}\to W^{+}bW^{-}\bar{b}\) is insensitive to the size and structure of the \(Wtb\) vertex. However, the angular distributions of (anti)top decay products give information about its structure, and can then be used to search for non-standard couplings. Angular distributions relating top and antitop decay products probe not only the \(Wtb\) interactions but also the spin correlations among the two quarks produced, and thus may be influenced by new production mechanisms as well. On the other hand, single top production is sensitive to both the size and structure of the \(Wtb\) vertex, involved in the production and the decay of the top quark [8, 10, 11].

In this paper we study the sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment [16] in the measurement of several angular distributions and asymmetries in the decays of top quark pairs. Previous works made by the ATLAS collaboration [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] have addressed some of the questions discussed in this paper. We consider the semileptonic decay channel of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair, in which one of the \(W\) bosons decays to leptons and the other one to quarks, that is, \(t\to W^{+}b\to\ell^{+}\nu b\), \(\bar{t}\to W^{-}\bar{b}\to\bar{q}q^{\prime}\bar{b}\) and the charge conjugate channels. For definiteness, we will refer to the first possibility from now on. We analyse the charged lepton distribution in the \(W\) rest frame, paying special attention to the forward-backward (FB) [22] and other new angular asymmetries, which do not depend on the top spin but can be related to the \(W^{+}\) polarisation. Additionally, we consider three representative spin correlation asymmetries [5, 23, 24] involving the final state leptons and quarks. The paper is organised as follows. In section 2 we discuss the structure of the \(Wtb\) vertex, defining the asymmetries studied and showing their dependence on the \(Wtb\) effective couplings. In section 3 the generation of the \(t\bar{t}\) signal and backgrounds is briefly outlined, together with the selection criteria used to analyse the \(t\bar{t}\) signal. In section 4 we present our results, and in section 5 we discuss their implications for the experimental determination of couplings and spin correlation parameters. Our conclusions are presented in section 6. Details regarding the estimation of systematic uncertainties are given in the appendices.

## 2 The effective \(Wtb\) vertex and angular distributions in \(t\bar{t}\) decays

The most general \(Wtb\) vertex containing terms up to dimension five can be written as

\[{\cal L} = -\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{b}\,\gamma^{\mu}\left(V_{L}P_{L}+V_{R}P_ {R}\right)t\;W_{\mu}^{-} \tag{1}\] \[-\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\bar{b}\,\frac{i\sigma^{\mu\nu}q_{\nu}}{M_{W} }\left(g_{L}P_{L}+g_{R}P_{R}\right)t\;W_{\mu}^{-}+{\rm h.c.}\,,\]

with \(q=p_{t}-p_{b}\) (we follow the conventions of Ref. [9] with slight simplifications to easy the notation). The new anomalous couplings \(V_{R,\;g_{L}}\) and \(g_{R}\) can be related to \(f_{1}^{R}\), \(f_{2}^{L}\) and \(f_{2}^{R}\) in Ref. [21] (and references therein) once we have \(f_{1}^{R}=V_{R}\), \(f_{2}^{L}=-g_{L}\) and \(f_{2}^{R}=-g_{R}\). If we assume CP is conserved, the couplings can be taken to be real. A general \(Wtb\) vertex also contains terms proportional to \((p_{t}+p_{b})^{\mu}\), \(q^{\mu}\) and \(\sigma^{\mu\nu}(p_{t}+p_{b})_{\nu}\). Since \(b\) quarks are on shell, the \(W\) bosons decay to light particles (whose masses can be neglected) and the top quarks can be approximately assumed on-shell, these extra operators can be rewritten in terms of the ones in Eq. (1) using Gordon identities. Within the SM, \(V_{L}\equiv V_{tb}\simeq 0.999\) and the other couplings vanish at the tree level, while at one loop level a nonzero value \(g_{R}=-0.00770\) is generated [25].

In models with new physics beyond the SM, departures from these predictions are expected. A moderate deviation from \(V_{L}\simeq 1\) is not visible in the process studied, as long as the top quark mainly decays to \(W^{+}b\) and all other channels are rare. The value of \(V_{L}\) sets the global scale for \(V_{R}\), \(g_{L}\) and \(g_{R}\), which can receive radiative contributions from new physics. The size of a \(V_{R}\) term is constrained by the measured rate of \({\rm Br}(b\to s\gamma)=(3.3\pm 0.4)\times 10^{-4}\)[26]. A right-handed coupling \(|V_{R}|\gtrsim 0.04\) would in principle give a too large contribution to this decay [27] which, however, might be (partially) cancelled with other new physics contributions. Hence, the bound \(|V_{R}|\leq 0.04\) is model dependent and does not substitute a direct measurement of this coupling. Similar arguments applied to the \(\sigma^{\mu\nu}\) terms do not set relevant constraints on \(g_{R}\), because its contribution is suppressed by the ratio \(q_{\nu}/M_{W}\) for small \(q_{\nu}\).

### Angular distributions in \(W\) rest frame

For the decay \(t\to W^{+}b\to\ell^{+}\nu b\), one can define \(\theta_{lb}\) as the angle between the three-momenta of the charged lepton and the \(b\) quark, in the \(W\) rest frame. The same definition is used for the charge conjugate decay. Alternatively, one may consider the angle \(\theta_{l}^{*}\) (which corresponds to the \(\Psi\) angle in Ref. [21]) between the charged lepton momentum (in the \(W\) rest frame) and the \(W^{+}\) boson momentum (in the top quark rest frame). Since in the top quark rest frame the \(b\) quark and \(W\) boson have opposite three-momenta, and the boost to the \(W\) rest frame is along the \(W\) momentum direction, we have \(\theta_{l}^{*}=\pi-\theta_{lb}\). Both approaches are equivalent and, in order to follow previous publications [17, 18, 19, 20, 21] the angle \(\theta_{l}^{*}\) is used in what follows. Using the shorthand \(x=\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\), for a given (fixed) value of \(t\) in the interval \([-1,1]\), an asymmetry can be defined as

\[A_{t}\equiv\frac{N(x>t)-N(x<t)}{N(x>t)+N(x<t)}\,, \tag{2}\]

with \(N\) standing for the number of events. The FB asymmetry \(A_{\rm FB}\) is defined by taking \(t=0\). For \(V_{R}=g_{L}=g_{R}=0\), its SM tree-level value is \(A_{\rm FB}=-0.2226\), for \(m_{t}=175\) GeV, \(M_{W}=80.4\) GeV, \(m_{b}=4.8\) GeV and neglecting the top and \(W\) widths (which amount to a \(10^{-4}\) correction). The dependence of the FB asymmetry on the anomalous couplings is depicted in Fig. 1.

Two additional asymmetries are introduced, by choosing \(t=x_{\pm}=\mp(2^{\frac{2}{3}}-1)\),

\[A_{\pm}\equiv\frac{N(x>x_{\pm})-N(x<x_{\pm})}{N(x>x_{\pm})+N(x<x_{\pm})}\,, \tag{3}\]

with \(N\) standing for the number of events. The reason for the choice of these specific values \(x_{\pm}\) will be made clear in what follows. For \(V_{R}=g_{L}=g_{R}=0\), the SM tree-levelvalues are \(A_{+}=0.5482\) and \(A_{-}=-0.8397\) respectively. The dependence of \(A_{+}\) and \(A_{-}\) on the anomalous couplings are depicted in Fig. 2.

These asymmetries can be related to the polarisation of the \(W\) bosons emitted in the decay, for which we take as spin quantisation axis their momentum direction. The \(W\) bosons can be produced with positive, negative or zero helicity, with corresponding

partial widths \(\Gamma_{R}\), \(\Gamma_{L}\), \(\Gamma_{0}\), being \(\Gamma(t\to W^{+}b)=\Gamma_{R}+\Gamma_{L}+\Gamma_{0}\). The different polarisation states of the \(W\) boson are reflected in the angular distribution of their decay products. The differential decay rate for unpolarised top quarks can be written as

\[\frac{d\Gamma(t\to W^{+}b)}{d\cos\theta_{l}^{*}}=\frac{3}{8}(1+\cos \theta_{l}^{*})^{2}\,\Gamma_{R}+\frac{3}{8}(1-\cos\theta_{l}^{*})^{2}\,\Gamma _{L}+\frac{3}{4}\sin^{2}\theta_{l}^{*}\,\Gamma_{0}\,, \tag{4}\]

with the three terms corresponding to the three helicity states, and vanishing interference terms [28]. In terms of the couplings in Eq. (1), we have

\[\Gamma_{0} = \frac{g^{2}|\vec{q}\,|}{32\pi}\left\{\frac{m_{t}^{2}}{M_{W}^{2}} \left[|V_{L}|^{2}+|V_{R}|^{2}\right]\left(1-x_{W}^{2}-2x_{b}^{2}-x_{W}^{2}x_{ b}^{2}+x_{b}^{4}\right)-4x_{b}V_{L}V_{R}^{*}\right.\] \[+\left[|g_{L}|^{2}+|g_{R}|^{2}\right]\left(1-x_{W}^{2}+x_{b}^{2} \right)-4x_{b}g_{L}g_{R}^{*}\] \[\left.-2\frac{m_{t}}{M_{W}}\left.\left[V_{L}g_{R}^{*}+V_{R}g_{L}^ {*}\right]\left(1-x_{W}^{2}-x_{b}^{2}\right)\right.\right.\] \[\left.\left.+2\frac{m_{t}}{M_{W}}x_{b}\left[V_{L}g_{L}^{*}+V_{R} g_{R}^{*}\right]\left(1+x_{W}^{2}-x_{b}^{2}\right)\right\}\,,\] \[\Gamma_{R,L} = \frac{g^{2}|\vec{q}\,|}{32\pi}\left\{\left[|V_{L}|^{2}+|V_{R}|^{ 2}\right]\left(1-x_{W}^{2}+x_{b}^{2}\right)-4x_{b}V_{L}V_{R}^{*}\right. \tag{5}\] \[+\frac{m_{t}^{2}}{M_{W}^{2}}\left[|g_{L}|^{2}+|g_{R}|^{2}\right] \left(1-x_{W}^{2}-2x_{b}^{2}-x_{W}^{2}x_{b}^{2}+x_{b}^{4}\right)-4x_{b}g_{L}g _{R}^{*}\] \[-2\frac{m_{t}}{M_{W}}\left[V_{L}g_{R}^{*}+V_{R}g_{L}^{*}\right] \left(1-x_{W}^{2}-x_{b}^{2}\right)\] \[+2\frac{m_{t}}{M_{W}}x_{b}\left[V_{L}g_{L}^{*}+V_{R}g_{R}^{*} \right]\left(1+x_{W}^{2}-x_{b}^{2}\right)\right\}\] \[\pm\frac{g^{2}}{64\pi}\frac{m_{t}^{3}}{M_{W}^{2}}\left\{-x_{W}^{2 }\left[|V_{L}|^{2}-|V_{R}|^{2}\right]+\left[|g_{L}|^{2}-|g_{R}|^{2}\right] \left(1-x_{b}^{2}\right)\right.\] \[\left.+2x_{W}\left[V_{L}g_{R}^{*}-V_{R}g_{L}^{*}\right]+2x_{W}x_{ b}\left[V_{L}g_{L}^{*}-V_{R}g_{R}^{*}\right]\right\}\] \[\times\left(1-2x_{W}^{2}-2x_{b}^{2}+x_{W}^{4}-2x_{W}^{2}x_{b}^{2} +x_{b}^{4}\right)\,,\]

where in the second equation the plus and minus sign correspond to \(\Gamma_{R}\), \(\Gamma_{L,}\) respectively. We have used the shorthands \(x_{W}=M_{W}/m_{t}\), \(x_{b}=m_{b}/m_{t}\) and

\[|\vec{q}\,|=\frac{1}{2m_{t}}(m_{t}^{4}+M_{W}^{4}+m_{b}^{4}-2m_{t}^{2}M_{W}^{2} -2m_{t}^{2}m_{b}^{2}-2M_{W}^{2}m_{b}^{2})^{1/2} \tag{6}\]

for the modulus of the \(W\) boson three-momentum in the top quark rest frame. Since the total top width is difficult to measure at LHC, it is common to work instead with the helicity fractions \(F_{i}\equiv\Gamma_{i}/\Gamma\). At the tree level, \(F_{0}=0.703\), \(F_{L}=0.297\), \(F_{R}=3.6\times 10^{-4}\), for the top, bottom and \(W\) boson masses quoted before (finite width corrections do not have a relevant influence on the normalised quantities [25]). \(F_{R}\) vanishes in the \(m_{b}=0\) limit because the \(b\) quarks produced in top decays have left-handed chirality,and for vanishing \(m_{b}\) the helicity and the chirality states coincide. The variation of the helicity fractions \(F_{i}\) in the presence of anomalous couplings is plotted in Fig. 3.

The asymmetries \(A_{\rm FB}\), \(A_{+}\), \(A_{-}\) can be expressed in terms of the helicity fractions,

\[A_{\rm FB} = \frac{3}{4}\left[F_{R}-F_{L}\right],\] \[A_{+} = 3\beta\left[F_{0}+(1+\beta)F_{R}\right],\] \[A_{-} = -3\beta\left[F_{0}+(1+\beta)F_{L}\right], \tag{7}\]

with \(\beta=2^{\frac{1}{3}}-1\). The choice of the particular values of \(x_{\pm}\) is now clear: for \(x_{\pm}=\mp(2^{\frac{2}{3}}-1)\), the asymmetries \(A_{+}\), \(A_{-}\) depend only on \(F_{0}\) and \(F_{R}\) or \(F_{L}\), respectively. The helicity fractions can also be obtained from \(A_{\rm FB}\), \(A_{-}\) and \(A_{+}\) by inverting Eqs. (7). The helicity ratios \(\rho_{R,L}\equiv\Gamma_{R,L}/\Gamma_{0}\) have been studied as well, and their variation in the presence of anomalous couplings is plotted in Fig. 4.

We must point out that, although within the SM the effect of the nonzero bottom

quark mass is expected to be small (for example the correction to \(A_{\rm FB}\) due to the nonzero \(x_{b}\simeq 0.027\) is of order \(O(10^{-4})\)), when we consider the possibility of non-standard couplings the bottom quark mass must be kept in the analysis. This can be easily seen from Eqs. (5) and (7). The dependence of the helicity fractions on \(g_{L}\) and \(V_{R}\) is given by linear and quadratic terms on \(x_{b}\). For small anomalous couplings these terms can be of the same size, and neither of them can be neglected.

### Spin asymmetries

Further angular asymmetries can be built, involving simultaneously decay products from top and antitop, and thus their spins. Top quarks are produced unpolarised at the tree level in QCD interactions, and with a very small \(O(10^{-2})\) transverse polarisation at one loop. However, the \(t\) and \(\bar{t}\) spins are strongly correlated, which allows the existence of angular asymmetries at the percent level. The spin of the \(t,\,\bar{t}\) quarks is not directly observable, but influences the angular distribution of its decay products: for the decay \(t\to W^{+}b\to\ell^{+}\nu b,q\bar{q}^{\prime}b\), the angular distributions of \(X=\ell^{+},\nu,q,\bar{q}^{\prime},W^{+},b\) (which are called "spin analysers") in the top quark rest frame are given by

\[\frac{1}{\Gamma}\frac{d\Gamma}{d\cos\theta_{X}}=\frac{1}{2}(1+\alpha_{X}\cos \theta_{X}) \tag{8}\]with \(\theta_{X}\) the angle between the three-momentum of \(X\) (in the \(t\) rest frame) and the top spin direction. The constants \(\alpha_{X}\) are called "spin analysing power" of \(X\) and can range between \(-1\) and \(1\). In the SM, \(\alpha_{\ell^{+}}=\alpha_{\bar{q}^{\prime}}=1\), \(\alpha_{\nu}=\alpha_{q}=-0.31\), \(\alpha_{W^{+}}=-\alpha_{b}=0.41\) at the tree level [29] (\(q\) and \(q^{\prime}\) are the up- and down-type quarks, respectively, from the \(W\) decay). One-loop corrections modify these values to \(\alpha_{\ell^{+}}=0.998\), \(\alpha_{\bar{q}^{\prime}}=0.93\), \(\alpha_{\nu}=-0.33\), \(\alpha_{q}=-0.31\), \(\alpha_{W^{+}}=-\alpha_{b}=0.39\)[30, 31]. We point out that in the presence of non-vanishing \(V_{R}\), \(g_{L}\) or \(g_{R}\) couplings the numerical values of the constants \(\alpha_{X}\) are modified [32], but the functional form of Eq. (8) is maintained. For the decay of a top antiquark the distributions are the same, with \(\alpha_{\bar{X}}=-\alpha_{X}\) as long as CP is conserved in the decay.

Working in the helicity basis, we can take \(\theta_{X}\) to be the angle between the momentum of \(X\) (in top rest frame) and the top momentum in CM frame (and analogously for \(\theta_{\bar{X}^{\prime}}\)), defining the asymmetries [23, 24]

\[A_{\rm X\bar{X}^{\prime}}\equiv\frac{N(\cos\theta_{X}\cos\theta_{\bar{X}^{ \prime}}>0)-N(\cos\theta_{X}\cos\theta_{\bar{X}^{\prime}}<0)}{N(\cos\theta_{X} \cos\theta_{\bar{X}^{\prime}}>0)+N(\cos\theta_{X}\cos\theta_{\bar{X}^{\prime}} <0)}\,. \tag{9}\]

Their theoretical value is proportional to the spin analysing powers of the two decay products \(X\), \(\bar{X}^{\prime}\) times a constant measuring the spin correlation of \(t\) and \(\bar{t}\), whose tree-level value is \(0.319\), and at one loop level is \(0.326\pm 0.012\)[31], dependent to some extent on the parton distribution functions (PDFs) used and the \(Q^{2}\) scale at which they are evaluated. In semileptonic top decays we select as spin analyser the charged lepton, which has the largest spin analysing power, or the neutrino. In hadronic decays, the jets corresponding to up- and down-type quarks are very difficult to distinguish, and one possibility is to use the least energetic jet in the top rest frame, which corresponds to the down-type quark 61% of the time, and has a spin analysing power \(\alpha_{j}=0.51\) at the tree level. An equivalent possibility is to choose the \(d\) jet by its angular distribution in the \(W^{-}\) rest frame [24]. For the charge conjugate decay, \(\alpha_{X^{\prime}}\alpha_{\bar{X}}=\alpha_{X}\alpha_{\bar{X}^{\prime}}\), so the equivalent asymmetry is \(A_{X^{\prime}\bar{X}}=A_{XX^{\prime}}\). Therefore, we can drop the superscripts indicating the lepton charge, and denote the asymmetries by \(A_{\ell j}\), \(A_{\nu j}\).

It is also interesting to study the relative angular distribution of one spin analyser from the \(t\) quark and other from the \(\bar{t}\). Let \(\varphi_{X\bar{X}^{\prime}}\) be the angle between the three-momentum of \(X\) (in the top rest frame) and of \(\bar{X}^{\prime}\) (in the antitop rest frame). With these angles we can build additional asymmetries

\[\tilde{A}_{\rm X\bar{X}^{\prime}}\equiv\frac{N(\cos\varphi_{X\bar{X}^{\prime} }>0)-N(\cos\varphi_{X\bar{X}^{\prime}}<0)}{N(\cos\varphi_{X\bar{X}^{\prime}}>0) +N(\cos\varphi_{X\bar{X}^{\prime}}<0)}\,, \tag{10}\]

which also depend on the top spin correlation. Since these spin asymmetries1 are less sensitive to new physics in the \(Wtb\) vertex [9, 33] and they may involve new physics in the production (that is, new contributions to \(t\bar{t}\) production modifying the spin correlation of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair) as well as in the decay, the correct strategy is to first measure \(A_{\rm FB}\), \(A_{+}\) and \(A_{-}\) (or equivalently, helicity fractions or ratios) to set constraints on \(Wtb\) anomalous couplings, and then use this information to look for new physics in the production through spin asymmetries.

## 3 Simulation of signals and backgrounds and event selection

The signal and various SM backgrounds are generated using several Monte Carlo programs. The \(t\bar{t}\to W^{+}bW^{-}\bar{b}\) events in which one of the \(W\) bosons decays hadronically and the other one in the leptonic channel \(W\to l\nu_{l}\) (with \(l=e^{\pm},\mu^{\pm}),\) are considered as signal events, 2 while any other decay channel of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair constitutes a background to this signal. Top pair production, as well as the background from single top production, is generated with TopReX 4.10[34]. Further backgrounds without top quarks in the final state, i.e. \(b\bar{b}\), \(W\)+jets, \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)+jets, \(WW\), \(ZZ\) and \(ZW\) production processes, are generated using PYTHIA 6.206[35]. In all cases we use CTEQ5L PDFs [36]. Events are hadronised using PYTHIA, taking also into account both Initial State Radiation (ISR) and Final State Radiation (FSR).

Footnote 2: From now on, the \(W\) boson decaying hadronically and its parent (anti)top quark will be named as âhadronicâ, and the \(W\) decaying leptonically and its parent top(anti)quark will be called âleptonicâ.

Signal and background events are passed through the ATLAS fast simulation program ATLFAST 2.53[37] for particle reconstruction and momentum smearing. A cone algorithm is used to associate clusters of energy deposits in the calorimeters into jets if their angular difference in the \(\eta-\phi\) plane, \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}\), is smaller than 0.4. The events are then passed through the ATLFASTB package to identify the jets which originate in \(b\) quarks. The \(b\) jet tagging efficiency is set to 60%, that corresponds to a rejection factor of 10 (100) for \(c\) jets (light quark and gluon jets).

Signal events have a final state topology characterised by one energetic lepton 3, at least four jets (including two \(b\) jets) and large transverse missing energy from the undetected neutrino. We apply three kinds of analyses to the events, two of sequential type and one probabilistic. In the sequential analyses, specific selection criteria are applied to the most relevant kinematical variables describing the event. The event selection in the probabilistic analysis is based on the construction of a discriminant variable which uses the full information of some kinematical properties of the event.

Each analysis develops its own jet association criteria to reconstruct the masses of the \(W\) bosons and top quarks.

### Sequential analyses

In both sequential analyses events are accepted if they have at least one lepton with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) and four high transverse momentum jets (with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV for the first analysis, \(p_{T}>20\) GeV for the second one), having \(|\eta|<2.5\). Two of the jets must be tagged as \(b\) jets, and the missing transverse momentum has to be above 20 GeV.

In the first sequential analysis (which will be labelled as "I") the hadronic \(W\) is reconstructed from the two non-\(b\) jets with highest transverse momentum, and their invariant mass is plotted in Fig. 5c. The parent top quark is reconstructed from these two jets and the \(b\) jet giving an invariant mass (shown in fig. 5a) closest to 175 GeV. The leptonic \(W\) momentum cannot be directly reconstructed due to the presence of an undetected neutrino in the final state. Nevertheless, the neutrino four-momentum can be estimated by assuming the transverse missing energy to be the transverse neutrino momentum. Its longitudinal component can then be determined, with a quadratic ambiguity, by constraining the leptonic \(W\) mass (calculated as the invariant mass of the neutrino and the charged lepton) to its known on-shell value \(M_{W}=80.4\) GeV. The leptonic \(t\) mass, shown in Fig. 5b, is reconstructed with the leptonic \(W\) and the remaining \(b\) jet. The quadratic ambiguity is removed by choosing the solution which gives a mass closer to 175 GeV. The distribution of the lepton transverse momentum is shown in Fig. 5d. The background is suppressed by requiring \(|m_{t}^{\rm had}-175|<40\) GeV, \(|M_{W}^{\rm had}-80.4|<25\) GeV. The number of signal and background events (normalised to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) and the signal efficiency after this selection are collected in Table 1.

In the second sequential analysis (named as "II") the hadronic \(W\) is reconstructed as before but we try an alternative \(b\) jet assignment and solution for the neutrino momentum ambiguity. The \(b\) jet from the hadronic top decay is choosen as the \(b\)-tagged jet maximising the hadronic top \(p_{T}\). The solution for the neutrino longitudinal momentum is the one which minimises the difference between the masses of the hadronic and leptonic top quarks. The cuts on the hadronic top and \(W\) masses are looser, \(|m_{t}^{\rm had}-175|<200\) GeV and \(|M_{W}^{\rm had}-80.4|<100\) GeV. The distributions obtained are shown in Fig. 6, and the number of background events and signal efficiency can be found in Table 1.

Figure 5: Distributions for the sequential analysis I: (a) the top mass reconstructed with the \(W\) decaying hadronically, (b) the top mass reconstructed with the \(W\) decaying leptonically, (c) the \(W\) mass from hadronic decays and (d) the lepton transverse momentum, are shown. The SM background (shaded region) and the \(t\bar{t}\) signal (full line) are normalised to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

Figure 6: Distributions for the sequential analysis II: (a) the top mass reconstructed with the \(W\) decaying hadronically, (b) the top mass reconstructed with the \(W\) decaying leptonically, (c) the \(W\) mass from hadronic decays and (d) the lepton transverse momentum, are shown. The SM background (shaded region) and the \(t\bar{t}\) signal (full line) are normalised to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

### Probabilistic analysis

This analysis is divided in two different levels. In the first one (called the pre-selection), a cleaner sample of signal events is obtained by applying a selection similar to the one in the sequential analysis II: exactly one lepton with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\); at least 4 jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\), two of them \(b\)-tagged as \(b\) jets and at least two not tagged; missing transverse momentum above 20 GeV. The number of signal and background events (normalised to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) and the signal efficiency after the pre-selection are shown in Table 2. Distributions of relevant variables are presented in Fig. 7.

In this analysis the hadronic \(W\) reconstruction is done from the two non-\(b\) jets with highest transverse momentum, as in the previous sequential analyses. The invariant mass of these two jets is represented in Fig. 8 at the pre-selectio

The SM background (shaded region) and the \(t\bar{t}\) signal (full line) are normalised to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

hadronic top, shown in Fig. 8, is reconstructed as the invariant mass of the hadronic \(W\) and the \(b\) jet (among the two with highest \(p_{T}\)) closer to the \(W\). As for the previous sequential analyses, the neutrino four-momentum is estimated by assuming the transverse missing energy to be the transverse neutrino momentum. In order to solve the quadratic ambiguity in the longitudinal component it is required that the hadronic and the leptonic top quarks have the minimum mass difference. The reconstructed mass of the leptonic top is shown in Fig. 8 at the pre-selection.

In the second level (the final selection), for each event we construct signal and background-like probabilities, \({\cal P}_{i}^{\rm signal}\) and \({\cal P}_{i}^{\rm back.}\), respectively, using probability density functions (p.d.f.) built from relevant physical variables:

* The hadronic \(W\) mass.
* The hadronic and leptonic top masses.
* The transverse momentum of the \(b\)-jets associated to the hadronic and the leptonic top quarks.
* The transverse momentum of the jets used in the hadronic \(W\) reconstruction.

Signal (\({\cal L}_{S}=\Pi_{i=1}^{n}{\cal P}_{i}^{signal}\)) and background (\({\cal L}_{B}=\Pi_{i=1}^{n}{\cal P}_{i}^{back.}\)) likelihoods (with \(n=7\), the number of p.d.f.) are used to define a discriminant variable \(L_{R}={\cal L}_{S}/{\cal L}_{B}\). This variable is shown in Fig. 9 for the signal and background. The final event selection is done by applying a cut \(L_{R}>-0.2\) on the discriminant variable, which corresponds to the highest \(S/\sqrt{B}\) ratio. The number of background events (normalised to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) and signal efficiency after the final selection are shown in Table 2.

## 4 Results

We use two methods to measure angular asymmetries, helicity fractions and ratios in top quark decays. The first one relies on the determination of the relevant angular distributions as intermediate steps to obtain the observables. In the second one, the asymmetries are directly calculated with a simple counting of the number of events below and above a specific value of \(\cos\theta\) (with \(\cos\theta\) standing for \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*},\,\cos\theta_{\ell}\times\cos\theta_{j},\)\(\cos\theta_{\nu}\times\cos\theta_{j}\) or \(\cos\varphi_{\ell j}\), depending on the asymmetry considered),4 and in this case Figure 8: Distributions for the probabilistic analysis at the pre-selection: (a) the \(W\) mass from hadronic decays, (b) the top mass reconstructed with the \(W\) decaying hadronically, (c) the top mass reconstructed with the \(W\) decaying leptonically, (d) the transverse momentum of the \(b\)-jet associated with the hadronic top, (e) the highest non b-jet \(p_{T}\) and (f) the second highest non b-jet \(p_{T}\), are shown. The SM background (shaded region) and the \(t\bar{t}\) signal (full line) are normalised to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

the parameters \(F_{i}\), \(\rho_{R,L}\) describing the polarisation of the \(W\) boson are obtained from the asymmetries inverting Eqs. (7).

The simulated angular distributions, which are obtained in each case including the signal as well as the SM backgrounds, are affected by the experimental resolution, reconstruction and selection criteria. After subtracting reference background samples, the distributions must be multiplied by correction functions \(f_{c}\) in order to recover the ones expected in the SM. The correction functions are calculated, for each bin of the corresponding distribution, dividing the number of events at the generator level by the number of events after the event selection, using a reference sample.

Due to the excellent statistics achievable at LHC, systematic errors play a crucial role in the measurement of angular distributions and asymmetries. A thorough discussion of the different systematic uncertainties in the determination of the correction functions is therefore compulsory. We estimate the systematic errors in the observables studied (asymmetries, helicity fractions and ratios) by calculating them with various reference samples and observing the differences obtained. We consider uncertainties originating from:

_Monte Carlo generator:_ The correction functions obtained from a sample generated with TopRex are applied to a sample generated with ALPGEN [38]. The difference between the values obtained at the generator level and after the simulation is considered as systematic uncertainty.

_Structure functions:_ The correction functions obtained from a reference sample

Figure 9: Distributions for the probabilistic analysis at the pre-selection: the discriminant variables for the SM background (shaded region) and the \(t\bar{t}\) signal (full line) are shown normalised to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

generated with CTEQ5L PDFs are applied to samples generated with CTEQ6L and MRST2001 PDFs in order to estimate the effects of the parton distribution functions on the correction functions, and thus on the observables. The most significant deviations found are considered as the systematic error associated to the structure functions.

_Top mass dependence:_ Samples corresponding to top masses of 170, 175 and 180 GeV are simulated, and the influence of \(m_{t}\) on the values obtained for the corrected asymmetries (using correction functions for \(m_{t}=175\) GeV) is determined. The systematic error used here is obtained from a linear fit of the values found corresponding to a top mass uncertainty of 2 GeV. (For this and the rest of the fits, see the appendices.)

_Initial and Final Sate Radiation:_ The effect of ISR and FSR is studied creating an event sample in which ISR and FSR are switched off in the event simulation. We compare the results of the reference sample (with ISR and FSR) with those obtained adding to it a normalised fraction of the sample without ISR nor FSR (from 0% to 25%, in steps of 5%). The values obtained for the observables are fitted with a linear function and the systematic error is considered as the effect of the presence of 20% (a conservative estimate of our level of knowledge of ISR and FSR) of the sample without ISR, FSR.

_b jet tag efficiency:_ The value of the \(b\) jet tag efficiency (and the corresponding \(c\) jet and light jet rejection factors) is varied from 50 to 70%, in steps of 5%, and the values obtained for the observables are fitted with a linear function The systematic error is considered as the effect on the observables of a variation of 5% in the \(b\) jet tagging efficiency, as compared with the standard value of 60%.

_b jet energy scale:_ The value of the \(b\) jet energy scale is changed from -5 to +5%, and the values obtained for the observables are fitted with a linear function. The systematic error is considered as the effect on the asymmetries values of a variation of 3% in the \(b\) jet energy scale.

_Light jet energy scale:_ The value of the energy scale of the light jets is changed from -3 to +3%, and the values obtained for the observables are fitted with a linear function. The systematic error is considered as the effect of a variation of 1% in the energy scale of the light jets.

_Background:_ The background (as obtained from the reference sample) subtracted to the selected sample is varied from -25 to 25%, in steps of 5%, and the values obtained for the asymmetries are fitted with a linear function. The systematic error is considered as the effect on the asymmetries of a variation of 10% on the background level (which takes into account the uncertainties in the cross-sections).

#### 4.1.2 Probabilistic analysis

We plot in Fig. 12 the distributions of \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\), \(\cos\theta_{\ell}\times\cos\theta_{j}\), \(\cos\theta_{\nu}\times\cos\theta_{j}\) and \(\cos\varphi_{\ell j}\), after the full selection. The correction functions \(f_{c}\) are shown in Fig. 13. The simulated values (including the contribution from signal and SM background) and the corresponding corrected values of the four asymmetries are collected in Table 5. Only statistical errors are quoted. The different systematic errors are summarised in Table 6.

### Asymmetry measurement with counting experiments

distributions. We show in Fig. 14, for the probabilistic analysis, the two-binned distributions of the \(A_{\rm FB},\,A_{\ell j},\,\tilde{A}_{\ell j}\) and \(A_{\nu j}\) asymmetries, as it would be obtained in counting experiments where events with \(\cos\theta<0\) (with \(\cos\theta\) standing for \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*},\,\cos\theta_{\ell}\times\cos\theta_{j},\)\(\cos\theta_{\nu}\times\cos\theta_{j}\) or \(\cos\varphi_{\ell j},\) depending on the asymmetry considered) and \(\cos\theta>0\) are kept in two different samples, corresponding to the two bins. The knowledge of the expected background contribution to each sample allows the values of all asymmetries to be reconstructed. This method serves as a cross-check of the previous one, and has the advantage of not being biased by the extreme values of the angular distributions where special care is required (larger uncertainties in the correction functions as it can be seen in Fig. 13). In Table 7 we show the expected statistical and systematic errors in the evaluation of the angular asymmetries with the counting experiment method. These results are in perfect agreement with the ones in Table 6.

### \(W\) polarisation

#### 4.3.1 Differential cross-section distribution

From the full reconstructed angular distribution \(d\sigma/d\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) one can extract the \(W\) helicity fractions by performing a fit to Eq. (4). The results (including only statistical errors) are presented in Table 10 for the sequential II and probabilistic analysis. The systematic uncertainties are shown in Table 11 and are larger than the statistical ones. These results are compatible with the ones of Refs. [39, 40].

The fit to the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) angular distribution can also be made by using only two free parameters (apart from an overall normalization constant) namely the helicity ratios \(\rho_{R,L}=\Gamma_{R,L}/F_{0}\). The reconstructed ratios together with the st

#### 4.3.2 Counting experiments

Another way of extracting the helicity fractions and ratios is through the asymmetries \(A_{\rm FB}\), \(A_{+}\) and \(A_{-}\). Using Eqs.(7) and assuming \(F_{0}+F_{L}+F_{R}=1\) one gets for the helicity fractions

\[F_{0} = -\frac{1+\beta}{1-\beta}\left(1+\frac{4}{3}A_{\rm FB}\right)+ \frac{2A_{+}}{3\beta(1-\beta)}=-\frac{1+\beta}{1-\beta}+\frac{A_{+}-A_{-}}{3 \beta(1-\beta)}\,,\] \[F_{L} = \frac{1}{1-\beta}+\frac{4\beta^{2}A_{\rm FB}-A_{+}}{3\beta(1- \beta)}=\frac{1}{1-\beta}-\frac{A_{+}-\beta A_{-}}{3\beta(1-\beta^{2})}\,, \tag{11}\] \[F_{R} = \frac{1}{1-\beta}-\frac{4\beta^{2}A_{\rm FB}-A_{-}}{3\beta(1- \beta)}\ =\frac{1}{1-\beta}-\frac{\beta A_{+}-A_{-}}{3\beta(1-\beta^{2})}\,.\]

The ratios can be easily obtained from these equations as well. The results (including only statistical errors) are presented in Table 13 for the sequential analysis II. The systematic uncertainties are shown in Table 14 and are larger than the statistical ones. The results obtained are compatible, within the errors, with the ones obtained with

the fitting procedure described above.

## 5 Discussion

The measurement of the asymmetries \(A_{\rm FB},\,A_{+}\) and \(A_{-}\) can be used to set limits on the anomalous couplings \(V_{R},\,g_{L},\,g_{R}\), using Eqs. (7), and Figs. 1-2. Assuming that only one coupling is different from zero at a time, from the values

\[A_{\rm FB} = -0.2237\pm 0.0035\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.0144\ ({\rm sys})\,,\] \[A_{+} = 0.5472\pm 0.0032\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.0099\ ({\rm sys})\,, \tag{12}\] \[A_{-} = -0.8387\pm 0.0018\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.0028\ ({\rm sys})\,,\]

obtained with the probabilistic analysis (in which systematic uncertainties are smaller) we can extract the best \(1\sigma\) limits in Table 15 by intersecting Eqs. (7) for each coupling

(keeping a non-vanishing \(b\) quark mass) with the \(1\sigma\) bands of the asymmetries \(A_{\rm FB}\), \(A_{+}\) and \(A_{-}\) (Fig. 15). For completeness the results for \(m_{b}=0\) are also shown for the FB asymmetry in Fig. 16. While for \(g_{R}\) there is no significant impact on the \(\pm 1\sigma\) limits obtained, the differences could go up to 17% (9%) for \(g_{L}\) (\(V_{R}\)) when the mass of the \(b\)-quark is not taken into account.

Another possibility is to use the \(W\) helicity fractions, from the probabilistic analysis,

\[F_{0} = 0.699\pm 0.004\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.021\ ({\rm sys})\,,\] \[F_{L} = 0.299\pm 0.004\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.019\ ({\rm sys})\,, \tag{13}\] \[F_{R} = 0.0021\pm 0.0030\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.0033\ ({\rm sys})\,,\]

or the helicity ratios from the sequential analysis II,

\[\rho_{R} = 0.0033\pm 0.0044\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.0084\ ({\rm sys})\,,\] \[\rho_{L} = 0.423\pm 0.012\ ({\rm stat})\pm 0.029\ ({\rm sys})\,, \tag{14}\]

to set limits on the anomalous couplings. The results obtained are very similar, and are also shown in Table 15. In Fig. 17 (Fig. 18) the dependence of the helicity fractions (helicity ratios) with the anomalous couplings are represented together with the values obtained for \(F_{0},F_{L}\) and \(F_{R}\) (\(\rho_{R}\) and \(\rho_{L}\)) and the \(\pm 1\sigma\) bands including statistical and systematic errors.

The fit to the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) angular distribution using \(\rho_{R}^{fit}=\Gamma_{R}/\Gamma_{0}\) and \(\rho_{L}^{fit}=\Gamma_{L}/\Gamma_{0}\) as free parameters (apart from the overall normalization constant) has also been used to extract the best \(1\sigma\) limits on the anomalous couplings. The results are shown in Table 15. Although for \(g_{R}\) there is no visible improvement with respect to the previous results, for \(V_{R}\) and \(g_{L}\) the results are better. One should also remark that the ratios \(F_{R}/F_{0}\) and \(F_{L}/F_{0}\) seem to be more sensitive to new couplings than the \(W\) helicity components alone \(F_{R}\), \(F_{L}\) and \(F_{0}\).

A direct measurement of the anomalous couplings can be obtained by fitting the angular distribution of \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) with the help of Eqs. (4) and (5), without evaluating the asymmetries or the \(W\) helicity fractions as intermediate steps. The results are shown in Table 16.

The \(1\sigma\) limits on anomalous \(Wtb\) couplings obtained by any of these methods can be used to constrain the possible variation of the spin asymmetries due to new physics in the decay vertex. In most cases the deviations are much smaller than the systematic uncertainty found in the previous section. Therefore, the measurement of spin asymmetries allow to extract information about spin correlations in a clean way. In particular, the value of spin correlation parameters can be extracted from the spin Figure 15: Measured asymmetries a) \(A_{\rm FB}\), b) \(A_{+}\) and c) \(A_{-}\) and their \(\pm 1\sigma\) bands, including both the statistical and the systematic errors, for the probabilistic analysis, and dependence of these asymmetries on the anomalous couplings \(V_{R}\), \(g_{L}\), and \(g_{R}\) (for \(m_{b}=4.8\) GeV). The \(1\sigma\) limits on the couplings are obtained from the intersection of the curve with the \(1\sigma\) bands.

## 6 Conclusions

In this note we have studied the ATLAS sensitivity to angular distributions and asymmetries in top decays. We have used several analysis and reconstruction methods to extract the values of the asymmetries with their statistical and systematic errors. For a luminosity of \(10\) fb\({}^{-1},\) the precision in the measurement of the asymmetries \(A_{\rm FB}\) and \(A_{\pm},\)\(W\) helicity fractions \(F_{i}\) and ratios \(\rho_{R,L}\) is already determined by the systematic error. Depending on the type of analysis, an improvement of a factor of two can be achieved, which is more related to the top mass reconstruction method than to the specific type of analysis peformed (sequential or probabilistic). For the spin asymmetries studied (\(A_{\ell j},\)\(\tilde{A}_{\ell j}\) and \(A_{\nu j}\)) statistical and systematic uncertainties are found to have roughly the same size after 1 year of data taking at \(10\) fb\({}^{-1}.\)

The expected relative precision of \(A_{\rm FB},\)\(A_{+}\) and \(A_{-},\) for an integrated luminosity of \(10\) fb\({}^{-1},\) is \(7\%,\)\(2\%\) and \(0.4\%,\) respectively. The new angular asymmetries \(A_{\pm}\) are therefore more precise than the forward-backward asymmetry. These asymmetries can be determined either from the full angular distribution \(d\sigma/d\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) or alternatively from a counting experiment method (which avoids the detailed knowledge of the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\)

A fit to the \(d\sigma/d\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) distribution was performed in order to extract the polarisation components of the \(W\) boson \(F_{i}\) (as was done in Refs. [21, 39, 40]). While for \(F_{0}\) (\(F_{L}\)) the relative precision is expected to be 3% (6%), for the \(F_{R}\) component the error

can be below 0.005. These results are compatible with the ones of Refs. [21, 39, 40]. Due to its small value, the \(W\) partial width ratio \(\rho_{R}\) has lower precision if a counting experiment method is used. A direct fit of the angular distribution (for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\)) allows to measure \(\rho_{R}\) with an error lower than 0.002. For the \(\rho_{L}\) a relative precision of 7% can be achieved with counting experiments.

The comparison of the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) distribution with the SM expectation can be used to set limits on possible anomalous \(Wtb\) couplings \(V_{R}\), \(g_{L}\), \(g_{R}\), as parameterised in Eq. (1). The best \(1\sigma\) limits on anomalous couplings are

\[-0.05\leq V_{R}\leq 0.12\,,\] \[-0.05\leq g_{L}\leq 0.02\,,\] \[-0.021\leq g_{R}\leq 0.017\,, \tag{15}\]

and might be slightly improved with more statistics. The bounds on \(g_{R}\) are the most stringent, but the sensitivity reached is not as high as necessary to detect the typical values \(g_{R}\simeq-0.004\)[41], \(g_{R}\simeq 0.003\)[42] predicted in some SM extensions.

The experimental detection of deviations from the SM prediction in the \(\cos\theta_{l}^{*}\) distribution seems unlikely. However, the bounds on anomalous couplings obtained are sufficient to constrain their possible effect on spin asymmetries. Therefore, any signifi

cant departure from the SM expectations for these asymmetries should be due to new physics in the \(t\bar{t}\) production process.
