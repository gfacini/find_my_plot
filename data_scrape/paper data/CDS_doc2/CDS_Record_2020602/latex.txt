**Comparison of Monte Carlo generator predictions from Powheg and Sherpa to ATLAS measurements of top pair production at 7 TeV**

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note summarizes some of the latest Monte Carlo generator studies using top quark pair (\(t\bar{t}\)) events in ATLAS. Variations of the resummation damping parameter \(h_{\rm damp}\) and PDF sets in the Powheg+Pythia8 setup are compared to ATLAS measurements of \(t\bar{t}\) production. In addition, Powheg+Pythia6, Powheg+Herwig++ and Sherpa predictions are also compared to the same measurements.

Introduction

The modelling of final state particles in events where top quarks are produced is one of the major sources of systematic uncertainties in measurements of top quark cross sections and of top quark properties in proton-proton collisions at centre-of-mass energies of \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV at the LHC. Since top quark pair (\(t\bar{t}\)) production is one of the major backgrounds for Higgs measurements and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, these analyses would also benefit from a better understanding of \(t\bar{t}\) modelling.

In this note predictions of various Monte Carlo (MC) generators are compared to data. It represents an update of the \(t\bar{t}\) modelling studies published in early 2015 based on parameter variations within the Powheg+Pythia6 setup [1] and uses the same data measurements as described in that note. Section 2 gives a short description of the MC models based on a NLO matrix element to simulate the hard scattering process which are used in this note.

Section 3 presents the studies using Powheg+Pythia8 samples, where the \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter as well as the used Parton Distribution Function (PDF) sets are varied and compared to ATLAS data corrected for detector effects using the Rivet framework. Afterwards, Section 4 presents more studies where the \(t\bar{t}\) Powheg+Pythia6 sample is compared with new generator setups, Powheg+Pythia8, Powheg+Herwig++ and Sherpa MEPS@NLO and also with ATLAS data using the Rivet framework as in the previous section. Finally, in Section 5 the conclusions of the studies are discussed. All studies are performed either at parton level or at particle level using MC samples.

## 2 Sample and object definitions

A summary of the generator settings of the MC samples discussed in this note are presented in Table 1.

* The Powheg+Pythia6 sample is generated using the Powheg NLO generator [2, 3, 4] (revision 2330, version 3.0) with the NLO CT10 [5] PDF. A NLO matrix element (ME) is used for the \(t\bar{t}\) hard scattering process. The resummation damping factor \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\), which is one of the parameter controlling the ME/Parton Shower (PS) matching in Powheg and effectively regulates the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) radiation, is set to the top quark mass. For the sample used by most Run 1 analyses, no resummation damping was applied (labelled as \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=\) infinity in the following figures). The PS, hadronisation and the underlying event (UE) are simulated using Pythia6[6] (version 6.427) with the Perugia 2011C tune [7] and the corresponding leading order (LO) CTEQ6L1 PDFs [8]. The hard process renormalisation \(\mu_{r}\) and factorisation \(\mu_{f}\) scales are set to the generator default value \(\mu\) that is defined by: \[\mu=\sqrt{m_{\mathrm{top}}^{2}+p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}},\] (1) where \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are the top quark mass and the top quark transverse momentum, evaluated for the underlying Born configuration (i.e. before radiation).
* The Powheg+Pythia8 sample is generated using the same setup for Powheg as for the Powheg+Pythia6 sample but the PS, hadronisation and the UE are simulated using Pythia8[9] (version 8.183) with the A14 tune [10] and the corresponding CTEQ6L1 PDFs. The matching of the ME to the PS is performed using the Main31 user hook [11] of Pythia8. Additional samples are produced to estimate the effect of more or less radiation, with variations on the used \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) value as shown in Section 4. Furthermore, samples are produced consider ing different NLO PDF sets at ME generation. The considered PDF sets are: NNPDF2.3 [12], MSTW2008 [13], HERAPDF1.5 [14] and NNPDF3.0 [15].
* The Powheg+Herwig++ sample is generated using the same setup for Powheg as for the Powheg+Pythia6 sample but the PS, hadronisation and the UE are simulated using Herwig++[16] (version 2.7.1) with the UE-EE-5 tune [10] and the corresponding CTEQ6L1 PDFs.
* The Sherpa[17] sample is generated using v2.1.1 with the MEPS@NLO[18] setup. The events are generated with a \(t\bar{t}\) matrix element plus 0 and 1 parton simulated at NLO and 2,3 and 4 partons at LO. The CT10 PDF is used and the PS, hadronisation and UE are simulated using the default Sherpa settings. For this sample, no tuning to ATLAS data has been performed yet.

Footnote ‡: The unfolding is performed directly to the top quark level. The top quark is defined after QCD radiation and before decay.

Both dileptonic and lepton+jets event samples are produced for comparison with the measured data distributions. All MC generator samples are produced with \(m_{\mathrm{top}}=172.5\) GeV and within the ATLAS software framework.

## 3 Powheg+Pythia8

In this section, studies using Powheg+Pythia8 samples are discussed. The \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter as well as the PDF used in the ME calculation are varied and the predictions are compared to unfolded collision data using the Rivet framework [19]. In the dilepton channel the jet veto analysis [20] is used, while in the lepton + jets channel a measurement of the jet multiplicity and transverse momentum spectra is used [21]. Kinematic distributions of the top quark and the \(t\bar{t}\) system are compared on parton level++ to unfolded data distributions [22]. For more details see Ref. [1].

### Resummation damping

In this section the effect of varying \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) on the top quark and \(t\bar{t}\) system kinematics is studied. A comparison of Powheg+Pythia8 samples with \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}=0.5\cdot m_{\mathrm{top}}\), \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), \(2\cdot m_{\mathrm{top}}\), \(4\cdot m_{\mathrm{top}}\) and \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) set to infinity is performed. The setup with \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) set to infinity had been the default one for most 7 and 8 TeV analyses and has been changed to \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) set to the top quark mass based on the studies presented in Ref. [1]. Since \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) controls the hardness of the hardest emission, which recoils against the \(t\bar{t}\) system, only the transverse momenta are expected to be sensitive to this parameter. Figure 1a shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of

the partonic top quark, where variations of the distribution are visible only for \(p_{\rm T}>200\) GeV, while the tension between the experimental data and the prediction for \(p_{\rm T}>100\) GeV are not resolved by any variation. Figure 0(b) shows the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system and here a much larger effect is observed as expected. In this observable, lower values of \(h_{\rm damp}\) are preferred. Only values close to the top quark mass are compatible with the unfolded data.

The same variations are also studied using differential distributions of the jet multiplicity as well as the differential distribution of the transverse momentum of the jets. Figures 1(a) and 1(b) show jet multiplicities for jets with \(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV and \(p_{\rm T}>80\) GeV, respectively. This measurement is done in the lepton+jets channel which has four jets with high transverse momentum from the top quark decay products in its final state. Therefore at leading order the first emission from the \(t\bar{t}\) hard scattering process is typically represented by the fifth jet. This can be observed in the jet multiplicity distribution for jets with \(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV. For low jet multiplicities the impact of the \(h_{\rm damp}\) variation is small. While many of the variations considered are within the current experimental precision, the data does favour lower values of \(h_{\rm damp}\). For jets with \(p_{\rm T}>80\) GeV the correlation with the top decay products is weaker and the jet from the first emission cannot be mapped to a certain jet bin. Therefore the \(h_{\rm damp}\) variation is visible in all jet bins. All variations are within the current experimental uncertainty for this observable. Figures 1(c) and 1(d) show the \(p_{\rm T}\) distributions of the first and fifth hardest jet in the event. The hardest jet in the event typically comes from the top quark decay and therefore only mild changes under \(h_{\rm damp}\) variations are observed. The fifth hardest jet typically corresponds to the first gluon emission that is recoiling against the \(t\bar{t}\) system. Therefore significant differences as seen in the \(t\bar{t}\) momentum spectrum are expected and observed here. Note the different ranges of the \(x\)-axes. For this distribution the samples with \(h_{\rm damp}\geq 2.0\cdot m_{\rm top}\) have deviations that are a bit larger than one standard deviation.

In summary, the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system is found to be the observable that is most sensitive to variations of \(h_{\rm damp}\). In general one can observe that the smaller the value of \(h_{\rm damp}\) is chosen, the better the

Figure 1: The Powheg+Pythia8 samples with different \(h_{\rm damp}\) variations are compared for the top quark \(p_{\rm T}\) (a) and the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system (b) in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events using ATLAS data unfolded to the top quark level at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [22]. The data are represented as closed (black) circles with statistical uncertainties. The yellow band is the total experimental uncertainty on the data (statistical and systematic). The generator predictions are shown as solid coloured lines.

prediction fits to the unfolded data. However a value of \(h_{\rm damp}=0.5\cdot m_{\rm top}\) is outside the uncertainty band of the \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution of the hardest jet. The behaviour of the Powheg+Pythia8 generator under variations of the \(h_{\rm damp}\) parameter is consistent with the behaviour of the Powheg+Pythia6 generator under the same variations [1]. Taking the available unfolded data into account, the conclusion is that a value of \(h_{\rm damp}\) equal to the top quark mass gives good data description. Although this parameter variation does not give perfect description of the top quark momentum, the Powheg+Pythia8 setup has a better agreement in this distribution than the Powheg+Pythia6 setup studied in Ref. [1].

Figure 2: The Powheg+Pythia8 samples with different \(h_{\rm damp}\) variations are compared to jet multiplicities (a and b) and the transverse momentum of the first and fifth hardest jet (c and d) in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events using unfolded ATLAS data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [21]. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

### PDF studies

Another free parameter in generating simulated samples for \(t\bar{t}\) production is the choice of PDFs in the generation of the hard process. It was shown in Ref. [22] that the choice of the PDF can have quite a significant impact on the kinematics of the \(t\bar{t}\) process. This study is now repeated using Powheg+Pythia8 with \(h_{\rm damp}\) set to the top quark mass as the default configuration. A variety of NLO PDF sets were studied, including the new NNPDF 3.0 which contains over a thousand new data points, both the recent HERA-II measurements and a wide set of new LHC data as well as improved theory calculations. The result for the kinematic distributions of the partonic top quark is shown in Figure 3. A discrepancy between the prediction and the experimental data for the invariant mass distribution of the \(t\bar{t}\) spectrum and the high top quark \(p_{\rm T}\) observed for the default Powheg+Pythia8 can only be reduced by the setup using HERAPDF1.5. This setup is closest to the data, just inside the uncertainty band for high transverse momenta.

As expected, the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system shows little sensitivity to the choice of the PDF and is well described by all setups. In contrast to the \(h_{\rm damp}\) variations, the choice of PDF does change the rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) system as shown in Figure 3d. The best agreement is achieved with the NNPDF setups. The jet multiplicity distributions for jets with \(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV shows a deviation from data only in the eighth jet bin. The multiplicity of jets with \(p_{\rm T}>80\) GeV between three and five jets is well described by all PDF sets. Distributions of the jet momenta and the jet veto analysis do not show big differences between the different PDF sets and are therefore not shown here.

In conclusion one can see that the best agreement with data is achieved using HERAPDF1.5 for the description of the hard scattering process. The rapidity of the \(t\bar{t}\) system is quite sensitive to the choice of the PDF set, while this distribution is unchanged by variations of \(h_{\rm damp}\). The PDFs NNPDF2.3 and NNPDF3.0 show a nice agreement with the unfolded rapidity distribution. When comparing the studies presented here with previous studies performed with Powheg+Pythia6, the trends observed in the \(h_{\rm damp}\) and PDF variations are similar. Looking at the agreement of the two setups with the data distributions, the setup with Powheg+Pythia8 with \(h_{\rm damp}\) equal to the top quark mass and HERAPDF1.5 allows for a better description of the data distributions for the top quark momentum and \(t\bar{t}\) system.

Figure 3: The Powheg+Pythia8 samples with different PDF sets are compared to the transverse momentum of the top quark (a) as well as the mass, rapidity and transverse momentum of the \(t\bar{t}\) system (b-d) in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events using unfolded ATLAS data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [22]. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

Figure 4: The Powheg+Pythia8 samples with different PDF sets are compared to jet multiplicities in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events using unfolded ATLAS data [21]. The data and theory predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

Generator comparisons

In the following, the current ATLAS baseline Powheg+Pythia6 sample is compared with more recent models for the parton showers and hadronisation, namely Powheg+Pythia8 and Powheg+Herwig++. Furthermore, the setups are compared to the Sherpa MEPS@NLO sample. In all Powheg samples the damping parameter is set to \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\). The generator predictions are compared to the experimental analyses described in Ref. [1].

Figure 5 shows the comparison of the three different generator setups with the jet veto observables \(f(Q)\)[20]. The variable \(f(Q_{0})\) is defined as the fraction of events that do not have an additional jet with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) larger than a certain threshold \(Q_{0}\). \(f(Q_{\mathrm{sum}})\) has a similar definition, where the sum of the transverse momenta of the additional jets is compared to a threshold \(Q_{\mathrm{sum}}\). The observables are shown for the jet in the rapidity interval \(|y|<0.8\) in Figures 4(a) and 4(b) and for rapidity interval \(|y|<2.1\) in Figures 4(c) and 4(d). The generator predictions for Powheg+Pythia8 agree best with the data, while the largest deviation is observed for the Powheg+Pythia6 sample at low \(f(Q_{\mathrm{sum}})\) values and for the Sherpa sample for the inclusive regions at high \(Q\). The Powheg+Herwig++ distributions give a generally good description of the data, with a small disagreement seen at low \(f(Q_{0})\) values in Figure 4(c).

In Figure 6, the samples are compared to experimental data for the differential cross-section measured as a function of the number of jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and as a function of the jet transverse momentum of the first and fifth jets. For the Powheg+Herwig++ setup, more jets are predicted than for the other samples. The best agreement with data is here achieved for the Powheg+Pythia6 setup that was chosen as default setup for Run I based on the studies presented in Ref. [1]. For events with more than five jets the predictions of both setups are mainly relying on the PS, thus have approximately leading-logarithm accuracy. Therefore a perfect agreement is not expected. In the Sherpa sample the first additional jet is generated at NLO and good agreement with data is observed. For the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), the Powheg+Pythia6 and Sherpa distributions show good agreement with the data, while the setup with Herwig++ shows deviations both at high and low transverse momentum. Similar observations can be made for the distribution of the fifth jet transverse momentum. Since the fifth jet in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events corresponds to one jet in addition to those from the top quark decay, this distribution is expected to be well predicted by all three setups, which use a LO or NLO \(t\bar{t}\) + 1 parton matrix element. Differences are observed between the distributions for the generator setups (which are within experimental uncertainties). A possible reason for these differences lies in the difference in the matching of Powheg to the different parton showers, e.g. in the starting scale of the shower, and in the parton shower algorithms themselves. Furthermore, the generator setups are tuned to different parameters and data. While the P2011C tune and the UE-EE-5 tune are based on parameters of the underlying event model, the tuning for A14 included also some shower parameters and ATLAS data at high transverse momentum. The disagreement between MC and data is largest for the Powheg+Herwig++ setup. Only the momentum distribution of the fifth jet is still within in the uncertainties of the data measurement. The same trend can be seen in the \(t\bar{t}\)\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions shown in Fig. 6(b). For the top quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions shown in Fig. 6(a) on the other hand, the setup for Powheg+Herwig++ gives the best agreement with data, only showing small descrepancies at low top quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Also the Powheg+Pythia8 sample gives a slightly better agreement with data than the setup with Pythia6.

Figure 5: The \(t\bar{t}\) baseline sample Powheg+Pythia6, a Powheg+Pythia8 sample, a Powheg+Herwig++ and a Sherpa sample are compared to the jet veto observables [20] in \(t\bar{t}\) dilepton channel events at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. \(Q_{0}\) is the \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold in a central rapidity interval for additional jets and \(Q_{\rm sum}\) is the scalar \(p_{\rm T}\) sum threshold of the additional jets in a rapidity interval. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

Figure 6: The \(t\bar{t}\) baseline Powheg+Pythia6 sample, a Powheg+Pythia8, a Powheg+Herwig++ and a Sherpa sample are compared to the differential cross-section observables [21] in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets channel events at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

Figure 7: The \(t\bar{t}\) baseline Powheg+Pythia6 sample, a Powheg+Pythia8 and a Powheg+Herwig++ sample are compared for the top quark \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (a) and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(t\bar{t}\) system (b) in \(t\bar{t}\) lepton+jets events using unfolded ATLAS data at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [22]. The data and generator predictions are represented in the same way as in Figure 1.

Summary

Various MC generators have been compared to ATLAS measurements of top quark pair production. The impact of variations of the \(h_{\rm damp}\) parameter in the Powheg+Pythia8 setup has been investigated and a setting of \(h_{\rm damp}=m_{\rm top}\) is found to best describe the data, although none of the \(h_{\rm damp}\) settings provide a good description of the transverse momentum of the top quarks. The differences observed in this note are smaller than the ones observed with previous Powheg+Pythia6 studies. The PDF variations show an impact on the transverse momentum of the top. Good agreement with data is obtained when using HERAPDF1.5. Powheg+Pythia8 is compared to the Powheg+Pythia6, Powheg+Herwig++ and Sherpa MEPS@NLO setup as well as the unfolded data. Powheg+Herwig++ is found to have an overall softer momentum distributions, leading to a better description of the data for the top and \(t\bar{t}\) momenta. It produces too many additional jets for a \(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV, but less jets for a \(p_{\rm T}>80\) GeV. A few discrepancies have been found for the Sherpa sample in the jet veto distributions. This is expected to improve with a dedicated ATLAS tune for Sherpa. None of the generator setups studied here gives good agreement in all kinematic distributions that are presented. Further studies are planned that include comparisons of distributions obtained with pseudo-top variables based on reconstructed final state objects [23] and the recently published Powheg+Pythia8 ATLAS tunes that include \(t\bar{t}\) observables [24].
