ABSTRACT

**We examine the single production of scalar leptoquarks at the LHC. The signal and backgrounds in observing such leptoquarks with the ATLAS detector are discussed. Under particular assumptions on the theoretical model parameters, the discovery limit is found to reach leptoquark masses of \(\sim 2.2\) TeV assuming \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) collected at \(\sqrt{s}=16\) TeV.**Introduction

The appearance of leptoquarks (S) is predicted in many theoretical models beyond the Standard Model (SM) and is inspired by the symmetry between the quark and lepton generations. These particles do not need to be heavy as they can have a mass of \(\sim 100\) GeV and still avoid conflicts with rapid proton decay and flavour-changing neutral currents (FCNCs) [1].

Leptoquarks appear naturally in composite models of quarks and leptons [2], such as the strong coupling version of the SM [3], where S is the bound state of two fermions. In GUT theories and in superstring-inspired E\({}_{6}\) theories [4], leptons and quarks appear in common multiplets and their scalar sector contains a S besides the Higgs boson(s). It is a member of the \(\overline{5}\) representation in GUT SU(5) theories and of the \(\overline{27}\) supermultiplet in the supersymmetric E\({}_{6}\) theories. Leptoquarks are also predicted in horizontal symmetric schemes where they are regarded as mediators between quark and lepton doublets [5] and in technicolour theories which unite techniquarks and technileptons in common multiplets of some global symmetry containing the SM symmetry [6].

Leptoquarks carry both lepton and baryon number, couple to both leptons and quarks and are triplets under SU(3)\({}_{C}\). The various quantum numbers that a S can have are model dependent thus making unique predictions of their properties difficult. The spin can be 0, 1, or 2, the electric charge Q = \(-\frac{4}{3},\ -\frac{1}{3},\ +\frac{2}{3}\) or \(+\frac{5}{3}\), weak isospin T = 0, \(\frac{1}{2}\), or 1, baryon number \(\pm\frac{1}{3}\), and lepton number \(\pm 1\). Finally, a S experiences three types of interactions. It couples weakly to a quark-lepton pair and it experiences ordinary colour and electromagnetic gauge interactions.

## 2 Present Experimental Limits

At e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) colliders, direct S pair production can proceed through the s-channel Z and \(\gamma\) exchange with the search region restricted by the kinematic reach of the machine. The most stringent result from an e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) collider comes from the LEP experiments where the limit M\({}_{\rm S}\geq\frac{\rm M_{Z}}{2}\) is presented [7]. It is also claimed that single S production from Z decay could extend the LEP I mass reach to \(\sim 70\) GeV [8].

If a S is too heavy to be produced directly at an e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) machine it can perhaps be detected through its indirect effects via virtual exchange since a S can contribute to the process e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\to\) q\(\overline{q}\) through t-channel exchange via its Yukawa couplings [9]. The S exchange will thus modify the q\(\overline{q}\) production cross-section as well as the forward-backward asymmetry A\({}_{\rm FB}\). Such limits will, however, be more model dependent than the direct pair-production case since the parameters of interest depend on M\({}_{\rm S}\) as well as on the ql-S couplings.

Direct S searches have also been undertaken at hadron colliders. The best limit of M\({}_{\rm S}>113\) GeV at 95% C.L. comes from the FERMILAB Tevatron [10]. The UA2 Collaboration [11] has placed a limit of M\({}_{\rm S}>67\) GeV at 95% C.L. for scalar S production assuming BR(S \(\to\) eq) = 50%. Varying this branching ratio from 10% to 100% yields a limit extending from the LEP I result to M\({}_{\rm S}>74\) GeV at 95% C.L. The UA1 Collaboration [12] has presented a limit of M\({}_{\rm S}>32\) GeV at 95% C.L. assuming BR(S \(\to\) \(\mu\)q) = 100%.

Finally, the ep collider HERA, operating at \(\sqrt{\rm s}=\)314 GeV, has a unique opportunity to discover a S through the s-channel resonance formation in the eq-system [13]. The signal would appear in the form of a narrow resonance peak in the x distribution at

\[x\approx\frac{M_{S}^{2}}{s}.\]

The HERA searches are expected to reach a discovery limit of about 250 GeV when the S coupling strength is of the order \(0.01\alpha_{em}\) and upto the kinematic limit if the coupling is equal to \(\alpha_{em}\) assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\). Again, if a S is too heavy to be produced directly at HERA, indirect effects via virtual exchange can be probed to search for deviations from SM expectations for certain processes [14]. For example, examining the ratio R \(\equiv\frac{\sigma_{\rm MC}}{\sigma_{\rm CC}}\), the discovery reach can be extended to \(M_{S}\sim 800\) GeV assuming electromagnetic coupling strengths and an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) per unpolarized electron and positron beam.

## 3 Single Leptoquark Production and Decay at the LHC

The single production of a S proceeds via

\[qg\to Sl,\]

where l is either a charged lepton or neutrino. The Feynman diagrams responsible for this process are shown in Figure 1. This process, however, is proportional to the unknown lq-S coupling and so is very model dependent. The most general form of this coupling is [15]

\[\vec{l}^{i}(A^{ij}+B^{ij}\gamma_{5})q^{j}S\ +\ h.c\]

where i and j are the generation indices and

\[\mid A^{ij}\mid^{2}\ +\ \mid B^{ij}\mid^{2}\ =\ (g^{ij})^{2},\]

which is the strength of the S coupling. This coupling g can be scaled to the electromagnetic coupling, \(\alpha_{em}\), thereby yielding

\[(g^{ij})^{2}\ =\ 4\pi k\alpha_{em}.\]

The value of k can be estimated from the process \(e^{+}e^{-}\to q\overline{q}\)[9]. Requiring that neither its cross section nor \(A_{FB}\) deviate by more than 10% from their SM predictions when incorporating the t-channel S contribution, it has been shown that k \(<0.1\) for \(M_{S}\leq 40\) GeV, k \(<1\) for \(M_{S}<200\) GeV and that k \(>1\) for \(M_{S}>200\) GeV. Since in the present study we consider only the cases with \(M_{S}\geq 1\) TeV, the conservative value of k=1 is used.

The coupling scale k is directly related to the decay width of the S into lq by

\[\Gamma_{S\to\rm lq}\ =\ \frac{M_{S}\ k\ \alpha_{em}}{4}\]

which for \(M_{S}=1\) TeV and k=1 gives \(\Gamma_{S\to\rm lq}=1.8\) GeV. In addition, the subprocess production cross-section \(\hat{\sigma}(qg\to Sl)\) is directly proportional to k [15]. Table 1 lists the total production cross-sections for single-S production at the LHC used in this study assuming k=1.

The S decay is to ql where l is a charged lepton or neutrino and q is a quark. This leads to very distinct signatures for single S detection through the three channels,1. jet + 1\({}^{+}\)1\({}^{-}\),
2. jet + \(\nu\overline{\nu}\),
3. jet + \(\nu\)1\({}^{\pm}\).

In the present analysis the following assumptions are made :

* The S is a spin-0 boson and has a charge of either +\(\frac{2}{3}\) or -\(\frac{1}{3}\) and the sum of both S and \(\overline{S}\) are included.
* Only the case where l = e and \(\nu=\nu_{\rm e}\) is considered, i.e. only a first generation S with no mixing between generations.
* Only the S detection signature (1) above is studied since it is expected to be the most background-free.
* The branching ratio for process (1) above is taken to be 12.5% for a Q= +\(\frac{2}{3}\) S and 37.5% for a Q= -\(\frac{1}{3}\) S. This is concluded on by taking the ratio of the u-quark distribution function in a proton to that of a d-quark to be on average 3 to 1.

The dominant SM backgrounds arise from

\[{\rm jet}+{\rm Z}(\rightarrow{\rm e}^{+}{\rm e}^{-})\]

referred to henceforth as the 'Z+jet' background and

\[{\rm jet}+{\rm t}(\rightarrow{\rm jet}~{}{\rm e}^{-}\overline{\nu}_{\rm e}) ~{}\overline{\rm t}(\rightarrow{\rm jet}~{}{\rm e}^{+}\nu_{\rm e})\]

referred to as the 't\(\overline{\rm t}\)' background. The SM backgrounds arising from WW, WZ, \(c\overline{\rm c}\), \(b\overline{\rm b}\) and Drell-Yan are expected to be negligible after folding in their production cross-sections with the branching ratios to 1\({}^{+}\)1\({}^{-}\) pairs and the kinematic cuts discussed in section 5 and thus will not be considered further.

## 4 The ATLAS Detector and Event Simulation

The Monte Carlo generation of single S production and it decay has been performed using the event generator PYTHIA 5.6 [16] at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 16 TeV since its contains the matrix elements of the necessary tree-level diagrams. In addition, it has the capability for treating the event component not coming from the hard-scattering process such as initial and final

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \hline \({\rm M_{S}}\) (TeV) & \(\sigma_{\rm prod.~{}single}\) (pb) \\ \hline \hline

2.2 & 4.4x10\({}^{-4}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}.

\end{table}
Table 1: Leptoquark Productionstate QCD and QED radiation and spectator parton interactions. It should be noted that no additional minimum bias events have been added to simulate the underlying event component present at the LHC other than what is already present by default in PYTHIA. The EHLQ set 1 structure function set with \(\Lambda_{\rm QCD}\) = 200 MeV [17] have been used with \(\rm Q^{2}=\hat{s}\). The parton fragmentation has been simulated using the Monte Carlo JETSET 7.3 [16]. The coupling scalar k has been set to unity. The S pseudorapidity distribution for \(\rm M_{S}\) = 1 TeV using the above generation prescription is shown in Figure 2.

In this analysis, the following ATLAS detector capabilities are assumed :

* A calorimeter (both for electromagnetic and hadronic showers) covering \(\mid\eta\mid<\) 2 and of granularity \(\Delta\eta\) x \(\Delta\phi\) = 0.02 x 0.02. The energy resolution for electromagnetic showers is \[\frac{\sigma}{\rm E}\ =\ \frac{10\%}{\sqrt{\rm E}}\ \oplus\ 1\%\] and for hadronic showers it is \[\frac{\sigma}{\rm E}\ =\ \frac{50\%}{\sqrt{\rm E}}\ \oplus\ 2\%.\]
* Jet clusters are reconstructed in the calorimeter in cones of 0.5 cell units in \(\eta-\phi\) space and a threshold of \(\rm E_{T}>10\) GeV is applied.

## 5 Leptoquark Signal Extraction

The S mass values considered are \(\rm M_{S}\) = 1.0, 1.5, 2.5 and 2.2 TeV and the signal event sample is selected by requiring the following cuts :

* Require that at least one jet cluster is formed, \(\rm N_{jet}\geq 1\), within \(\mid\eta\mid<\) 2.
* The two highest \(\rm p_{T}\) electron candidates be greater than 300 GeV and be within \(\mid\eta\mid<\) 2. These electron candidates correspond to the electrons produced in association with the S (\(\rm p_{T}^{e_{1}}\)) and from the S decay itself (\(\rm p_{T}^{e_{2}}\)). Figures 3 and 4 show these electron \(\rm p_{T}\) distributions.
* The highest transverse momentum jet cluster in the event, \(\rm p_{T}^{j_{1}}\), be greater than 300 GeV and satisfy \(\mid\eta\mid<\) 2. Figure 5 shows the \(\rm p_{T}^{j_{1}}\) distribution for \(\rm M_{S}\) = 1 TeV. (The low energy shoulder is due, as explained below, to the association of the highest \(\rm p_{T}\) jet with a quark not coming from a S decay.)

The above two cuts increase the sensitivity to the high- \(\rm p_{T}\) kinematic region expected for the high S masses studied, and as will be shown in section 6, defines a region removed from the where the background is expected.

* To reduce the SM background arising from the Z+jet background, the invariant mass of the two highest \(\rm p_{T}\) electrons, \(\rm M_{e_{1},e_{2}}\), is restricted to be greater than 120 GeV. The \(\rm M_{e_{1},e_{2}}\) distribution is shown in Figure 6 for \(\rm M_{S}\) = 1 TeV.

* The invariant mass of the electron from S decay and the highest \(\rm{p_{T}}\) jet, \(\rm{M_{e_{2},j_{1}}}\), is shown in Figure 7 and is requested to be within a window of \(\pm\) 50 GeV from the nominal S mass. This increases the sensitivity to the S resonance and is also removed from the peak in the corresponding distribution from the \(\rm{t\overline{t}}\) background (see section 6).

Following the application of the above cuts, it is possible to calculate the S detection acceptances and the number of events expected at the LHC. Table 2 lists the acceptances for a S of various masses. (Each acceptance is quoted assuming that the previous analysis cut in the list has been performed and \(\rm{M_{e_{2},j_{1}}}\) is calculated within a window of \(\pm\) 50 GeV around the nominal S mass.)

The number of S signal events within a window of \(\pm\) 50 GeV from the nominal S mass is then calculated for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and are listed in Table 3. It is assumed that the detection efficiency for single, isolated electrons is 90%.

Figure 8 shows the \(\rm{M_{e_{2},j_{1}}}\) distribution for \(\rm{M_{S}}\) = 1 TeV with a Gaussian fit superimposed within the interval \(950<\rm{M_{e_{2},j_{1}}}<1050\) GeV. The resolution is found to be about 16 GeV and increases to about 23 GeV for an inferior calorimeter having a resolution for hadronic showers of

\[\frac{\sigma}{\rm{E}}\ =\ \frac{100\%}{\sqrt{\rm{E}}}\ \oplus\ 2\%.\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline \(\rm{M_{S}}\) = 1.0 TeV & \(\rm{M_{S}}\) = 1.5 TeV & \(\rm{M_{S}}\) = 2.0 TeV & \(\rm{M_{S}}\) = 2.2 TeV \\ \hline \hline \(\rm{N_{jet}}>1\) & 0.991 & 0.994 & 0.996 & 0.996 \\ \(|\ \eta^{\rm{jet}}\ |<2\) & & & & \\ \hline \(|\ \eta^{\rm{e_{1},e_{2}}}|<2\) & 0.73 & 0.78 & 0.82 & 0.83 \\ \hline \(\rm{p_{T}^{e_{1}}}>300\) GeV & 0.53 & 0.68 & 0.76 & 0.79 \\ \hline \(\rm{p_{T}^{e_{2}}}>300\) GeV & 0.82 & 0.95 & 0.98 & 0.99 \\ \hline \(\rm{p_{T}^{e_{1}}}>300\) GeV & 0.76 & 0.91 & 0.95 & 0.95 \\ \hline \(\rm{M_{e_{1},e_{2}}}>120\) GeV & 0.991 & 0.994 & 0.996 & 0.997 \\ \hline \(\rm{M_{e_{2},j_{1}}}\) & 0.65 & 0.62 & 0.59 & 0.58 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}
Table 3: Total Number of Expected Leptoquark EventsFor M\({}_{\rm S}\) = 2.2 TeV, the S mass resolution has worsened to about 25 GeV assuming the better of the two calorimeter resolutions.

A non-Gaussian tail is visible on the lower side of the S resonance. This tail is removed when instead of taking the highest \({\rm p_{T}}\) jet, the u-quark parton itself coming from the S decay is'taken when calculating the invariant mass (see Figure 9). The non-Gaussian tail is formed in cases when the highest \({\rm p_{T}}\) jet does not arise from the fragmentation of the u-quark from S decay. When requiring the difference in azimuthal angle, \(\Delta\phi({\rm u-j1})<~{}0.1^{\circ}\), the non-Gaussian tail disappears whereas if a looser cut of \(5^{\circ}\) is applied the non-Gaussian tail is still evident (see Figure 10). The non u-quark jet that is picked up is on average of lower energy than the u-quark from S decay and so the non-Gaussian tail is formed on the lower side of the S resonance.

## 6 Determination of the Background

The first SM background to be studied is Z+jet. The same Monte Carlo packages as used for the signal are used. The \(2\to 2\) tree-level processes \({\rm q\overline{q}\to gZ}\) and \({\rm qg\to qZ}\) have been used. To save on CPU time the events are generated with a minimum \(\hat{\rm p_{T}}\) of 400 GeV where \(\hat{\rm p_{T}}\) is the final-state parton momentum defined in the rest frame of the hard interaction. As is shown in Figure 11 this choice of threshold does not introduce any bias in the number of events expected after normalizing to \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

The Z+jet background is found to be negligibly small after applying the strict kinematic cuts used for the signal from section 5. Figure 12 shows the M\({}_{\rm e_{1},e_{2}}\) distribution of the two leading electron candidates for which a cut at 120 GeV is seen to be very effective as expected in reducing the Z+jet background. Table 4 lists the acceptance for the Z+jet background for the case 950 \(<\) M\({}_{\rm e_{2},j1}<1050\) GeV. The electron-jet invariant mass is independent of which of the two highest- \({\rm p_{T}}\) electron candidates are taken since they both come from the Z decay.

The number of Z+jet background events satisfying 950 \(<\) M\({}_{\rm e_{2},j1}<\) 1050 GeV for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Table 5, from where one can conclude that the Z+jet background is negligible compared to the S signal.

The \({\rm t\overline{t}}\) background is, however, not negligible and for M\({}_{\rm S}\geq 2\) TeV is comparable to the S signal. Again, the same Monte Carlo software as used for the signal simulation has

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \hline Analysis Cut & Acceptance \\ \hline \hline N\({}_{\rm jet}>1\) & 0.99 \\ \(|\eta^{\rm jet}|<2\) & \\ \hline \(|\eta^{\rm e_{1},e_{2}}|<2\) & 0.87 \\ \hline p\({}_{T}^{e_{1}}>300\) GeV & 0.40 \\ \hline p\({}_{T}^{e_{2}}>300\) GeV & 0.06 \\ \hline p\({}_{T}^{1}>300\) GeV & 0.98 \\ \hline M\({}_{\rm e_{1},e_{2}}>120\) GeV & 0.01 \\ \hline M\({}_{\rm e_{1},j_{1}}\) & 0.06 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Z+jet Background Acceptancesbeen used and the \(2\to 2\) tree-level processes gg \(\to\) t\(\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) and q\(\overline{\mathrm{q}}\)\(\to\) t\(\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) have been included. The mass of the top quark has been taken to be 140 GeV. To save on CPU time the events have been generated with a cut of \(\hat{\mathrm{p}}_{\mathrm{T}}>450\) GeV and, as is shown in Figure 13, no bias is introduced in the data sample with this choice of cut-off.

Table 6 lists the acceptances for the t\(\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) background for various \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{e}_{2},\mathrm{i}}\) intervals. The electron-jet invariant mass is independent of which of the two highest- p\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\) electrons is taken. Table 7 lists the number of t\(\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) events for an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

## 7 Leptoquark Detection Sensitivity

Figure 14 shows the \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{e}_{2},\mathrm{i}}\) distributions of the S signal for various \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{S}}\) values superimposed on the expected t\(\bar{\mathrm{t}}\) background with both normalized to 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). A clear signal is visible upto \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{S}}\sim 2.2\) TeV. To quantify this sensitivity, the statistical significance, \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{SD}}\), defined as

\[\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{SD}}\ =\ \frac{\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S}}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{N}_{ \mathrm{\bar{t}}}}}\]

and where \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{S}}\) and \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{\bar{t}}}\) are calculated in the interval \(\pm\) 50 GeV around the nominal S mass, is listed in Table 8. Assuming a cut-off of \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{SD}}\ >\ 5\) to be sensitive to a S signature, the accumulation of 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) enables the detection of a S upto \(\mathrm{M}_{\mathrm{S}}\sim 2.2\) TeV (see Figure 15).

To gauge the effect of the accumulation of less data, Table 8 also lists the expected statistical significance for integrated luminosities of 10\({}^{3}\) and 10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). As expected the S

\begin{table}
