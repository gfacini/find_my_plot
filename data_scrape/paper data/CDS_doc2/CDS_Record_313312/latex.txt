###### Abstract

We present hereafter a particle level simulation of the trilepton signal expected from the MSSM in excess with respect to the corresponding SM processes. We demonstrate the possibility to extract the most favorable SUSY trilepton signal, namely:

\(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\chi^{0}_{2}\longrightarrow 3l+p_{T}^{miss}\) and we propose a new method to measure one of the MSSM parameter (over a quite restricted domain of the parameter space).

All the results are given for one year of LHC run at low luminosity (\(10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\)).

## I. Introduction.

In the framework of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model (MSSM), there are sparticles called charginos and the neutralinos which arise, after the SUSY and electroweak (EW) symmetry breakings, as mixed states of superpartners of the EW gauge bosons and of the two Higgs doublets. There are two charginos, which are Dirac fermions, noted \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\chi_{2}^{\pm}\), and four neutralinos, Majorana fermions, noted \(\chi_{1}^{0}\),\(\chi_{2}^{0}\),\(\chi_{3}^{0}\) and \(\chi_{4}^{0}\) (the subscript increasing with the mass). In the MSSM, one assumes the R-parity conservation, this implies that all sparticles are pair-produced and finally decay into the lightest one (LSP) which is supposed to be the lightest neutralino: \(\chi_{1}^{0}\). This neutral and colorless sparticle behaves essentially like a massive neutrino: it escapes the detector causing the missing \(p_{T}\) generic feature of most SUSY signals. We restricted ourselves to the MSSM framework that we distinguish from the minimal supergravity (SUGRA) model even though the lattest have inspired to some extent our choice for the parameters values. We've tried to summarize some common features and the main differences of the two models in the appendix.

The MSSM depends on five independent parameters :

\(\bullet\)\(m_{\tilde{g}}\): the gluino mass,

\(\bullet\)\(\mu\): the higgsino mass term,

\(\bullet\)\(tan(\beta)\): the ratio of the two Higgs doublets vacuum expectation values,

\(\bullet\)\(m_{A^{0}}\): the pseudo-scalar higgs mass,

\(\bullet\)\(m_{\tilde{\theta}}\): the sfermions universal mass;

plus the bilinear and trilinear coupling terms that will be set null hereafter. At the tree level, the chargino-neutralino sector of the MSSM depends only on three of them: \(m_{\tilde{g}}\), \(\mu\) and \(tan(\beta)\).

The present limits on the MSSM mass spectrum are [1]:

\(m_{\chi_{1}^{0}}>18\ GeV\), \(m_{\chi_{1}^{0}}>46\ GeV\)[4],

\(m_{\chi_{2}^{0}}>45\ GeV\), \(m_{\chi_{3}^{0}}>99\ GeV\),

\(m_{\chi_{4}^{0}}>70\ GeV\),

\(m_{\chi_{4}^{0}}>108\ GeV\) at 95 % C.L., and

\(m_{\tilde{\phi}}>90\ GeV\) (if \(m_{\tilde{g}}<410\ GeV\)), \(m_{\tilde{g}}>100\ GeV\ (\forall m_{\tilde{\phi}})\)

\(m_{\tilde{\phi}}>218\ GeV\) (if \(m_{\tilde{g}}>m_{\tilde{\phi}}\)), \(m_{\tilde{g}}>218\ GeV\) (if \(m_{\tilde{\phi}}\leq m_{\tilde{g}}\)) at 90 % C.L.

The parameter \(tan(\beta)\) is constrained to be: \(1\leq tan(\beta)\leq m_{t}/m_{b}\).

The particular interest in studying the \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\) and the \(\chi_{2}^{0}\) is that they are among the lightest fragments of the MSSM, as shown on figure 3 (done for \(m_{A^{0}}\)=500 GeV).

Figure 3: MSSM low masses spectrum. The sleptons masses were evolved down from the unification scale according to the RGE [1].

The initial aim of this analysis was the study of the purely leptonic decays of charginos and neutralinos at LHC. As shown in [2, 3] the best channel for this is \(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\chi^{0}_{2}\longrightarrow 3l+p_{T}^{miss}\). At first glance, it seemed the signal was visible over the SM backgrounds. But when the issue of additionnal MSSM backgrounds was addressed [5] the answer became less clear. So we decided to determine the main trilepton sources of the MSSM, i.e. any process with \(\sigma_{prod}>10\) fb at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Hence the first question we can answer is wether ATLAS will be able to see an excess in the 3l rate with respect to the SM predictions.

The rest of this note will be organised as follows. In section II we'll describe the main features of the \(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\chi^{0}_{2}\longrightarrow 3l+p_{T}^{miss}\) process, section III will be a review of the main SM and MSSM trileptons sources. The cuts applied will be discussed in section IV and section V will contain the result of the comparison between the MSSM and the SM in the trilepton modes. In section VI, we'll look at specific cuts needed for the \(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\chi^{0}_{2}\) signal to emerge over all the backgrounds and finally, in section VII, we'll try to derive some informations about the model parameters.

All the SUSY processes were simulated with the ISAJET 7.08 Monte-Carlo, whilst the SM ones were generated with PYTHIA 5.7-JETSET 7.4. We performed this analysis at low luminosity for which the pile-up is negligible. In order to evaluate the backgrounds properly, at least \(10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) were generated for each channel except for the SUSY channels at \(m_{\tilde{g}}\)= 200 GeV for which we produced only \(10^{3}\)\(pb^{-1}\) (this represents a total of more than 80 M of events).

We used a simplified calorimeter with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)=0.05x0.05 and a pseudo-rapidity coverage of \(|\eta|<\)5. The energy smearing of the ECAL and HCAL were respectively:

\[\sigma/E=10\%/\sqrt{E}+1\%\]

and

\[\sigma/E=50\%/\sqrt{E}+3\%.\]

For the jets reconstruction, we applied the elementary algorithm GETJET where the jet initiator could be any-cell with more than 1 GeV of \(E_{T}\), the jet cone had a \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.6\) and any hadronic cluster containing more than 10 GeV of \(E_{T}\) inside the cone was considered as a jet. We calculated the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) of each event by doing the vector sum of all the particles (except for the neutrinos and the LSPs) \(p_{T}\) up to \(|\eta|\)=5. The resolutions on leptons \(p_{T}\) and on the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) weren't taken in account.

**II. The \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{0}\longrightarrow\) 31 + \(p_{T}^{miss}\) channel.**

**1. Direct production of \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{0}\) pairs.**

Two subprocesses contribute to the \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{0}\) production in hadronic collisions: there's the DRELL-YAN in the s-channel (fig. 4) and the virtual squark exchange in channels t or u (fig. 5). The resulting cross-section has the magnitude of typical Drell-Yan processes and its dependance on the parameters is shown in figure 6 and 7.

## 2 The leptonic decay modes.

To study chargino-neutralino pairs at high energy hadronic colliders one has to look at their purely leptonic final states because hadronic ones would be overwhelmed by the huge QCD background.

The charginos and neutralinos have three kinds of decay modes:

(1) decay via a vector boson \(W^{\pm}\) or \(Z^{0}\) (real or virtual): with, for instance,

\[\chi_{i}^{\pm}\to W^{\pm}+\chi_{j}^{0}\]

\[\chi_{j}^{0}\to Z^{0}+\chi_{l<j}^{0}\]

(2) decay via a higgs: like

\[\chi_{j}^{0}\to h^{0},A^{0},H^{0}+\chi_{l<j}^{0}\]

or

\[\chi_{i}^{\pm}\to H^{\pm}+\chi_{j}^{0}\]

this occurs when the mass splittings between the states are sufficient to allow the transition, that is when one considers heavy \(\chi_{i}^{\pm}\) or \(\chi_{j}^{0}\) (or very light higgses), or when the gluino mass is large enough.

(3) decay by slepton exchange:

In the 3l mode, we've got: \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\to W^{\pm}+\chi_{1}^{0}\) or \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\to\tilde{l}^{\pm}+\nu\) and \(\chi_{2}^{0}\to Z^{0}+\chi_{1}^{0}\),

\(\hookrightarrow l^{\pm}\nu\)\(\hookrightarrow l^{\pm}\chi_{1}^{0}\)\(\hookrightarrow l^{+}l^{-}\)

where the undetected neutrinos and LSPs (\(\chi_{1}^{0}\)) cause the \(p_{T}^{miss}\).

The two following figures display the leptonic branching fractions of this 31 channel:

fig. 10,11: The \(\chi^{0}_{2}\) and \(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\) leptonic BR as a function of \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) (left) and \(\mu\) for \(m_{\tilde{g}}=\)400 GeV (right).

In order to observe this decay mode, we simulated the signal for the following values of the MSSM parameters:

\(\bullet\)\(m_{\tilde{g}}=\) 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 GeV,

\(\bullet\)\(\mu=-m_{\tilde{g}}\) (to enhance the \(\chi^{0}_{2}\) leptonic BR [4]),

\(\bullet\)\(m_{\tilde{g}}=2m_{\tilde{g}}\) or \(m_{\tilde{g}}=m_{\tilde{g}}+20\) GeV (because having \(m_{\tilde{g}}\approx m_{\tilde{g}}\) also enhances the \(\chi^{0}_{2}\) leptonic BR [4]),

\(\bullet\)\(tan(\beta)=2\) and 20.

For a higher gluino mass the trilepton signal vanishes. This is due to the opening of the modes: \(\chi^{0}_{2}\to Z^{0}+\chi^{0}_{1}\) via a real \(Z^{0}\) (with a smaller leptonic BR and a high background from the EW gauge bosons, see III.1.) as well as \(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\to W^{\pm}+\chi^{0}_{1}\) with a real \(W^{\pm}\), and especially \(\chi^{0}_{2}\to h^{0}+\chi^{0}_{1}\).

\(\hookrightarrow b\bar{b}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:9]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

Taking in account the central values and the lower bound of the top mass as published by CDF [6] and D0 [7], we generated the \(t\overline{t}\) with a mass \(m_{t}\)=175 GeV and also with \(m_{t}\)=150 GeV to check wether the corresponding cross-section (which is a factor 2 higher) threatens the signal observation.

In a detailed simulation one should also consider the main dilepton backgrounds (\(t\overline{t},~{}Z,~{}W^{\pm}W^{\mp}\),...) associated with the instrumental backgrounds faking single electrons.

**2. MSSM trileptons sources.**

Beside these SM backgrounds, all the trileptons sources of the MSSM, except \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{0}\), ought to be considered as backgrounds as soon as one wants to study only this specific channel.

There are four types of 3l sources in the MSSM:

(a) The strongly interacting sparticles: \(\tilde{g}\tilde{g}\), \(\tilde{q}\tilde{g}\), \(\tilde{q}\tilde{q}\). They are produced in SUSY QCD interactions like:

Fig. 17: Gluinos and squarks production at LHC.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

**IV. The cuts.**

To separate the signal from the backgrounds we applied a set of cuts discussed hereafter. At first we required to have trileptons events (like in \(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\chi^{0}_{2}\longrightarrow 3l\)).

(a) Selection of the 3l events:

\(\bullet\) 3l (\(e^{\pm}\) or \(\mu^{\pm}\)) with an \(|\eta|<\)2.5,

\(\bullet\) 1 opposite sign (OS) and same flavor (SF) lepton pair per event (like in the \(\chi^{0}_{2}\) leptonic DK). The invariant mass of such a pair \(m_{\mu l_{1}}\not\in[m_{2^{0}}\pm 10~{}GeV]\) (so as to supress the irreducible SM backgrounds; this cut doesn't affect the signal much because over all the parameter space considered here, the \(\chi^{0}_{2}\) goes into the \(\chi^{0}_{1}\) via a virtual \(Z^{0}\))

\(\bullet\) high \(p_{T}\) leptons: \(p_{T}(l_{1},l_{2})>20~{}~{}{\rm GeV}\) and \(p_{T}(l_{3})>10~{}~{}{\rm GeV}\) (to remove the huge heavy flavors semi-leptonic decays expected in such high energy hadron collisions).

What's more, we adopted an overall lepton identification efficiency of 90 % and a charge misassignment of 1%.

As seen in the following histogram, the \(b\bar{b}\) (and the \(c\bar{c}\) as well) produces trileptons that are too soft to pass the \(p_{T}\) cut; so we won't consider it any longer.

fig. 19: The lepton \(p_{T}\) spectra of the \(b\bar{b}\) DK, the solid line is for the hardest lepton, the dashed line for the second and the dots are for the softest one.

Then in order to have the cleanest leptonic signal in a hadronic environment, we imposed to have as less hadronic activity as possible in the trilepton events.

(b) Reduction of the hadronic activity:

\(\bullet\) lepton isolation: around each triggered lepton, \(E_{T}^{HAD}<\)5 GeV in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.3\) (this cut is especially efficient to remove the semi-leptonic decays of heavy flavors where the lepton is often surrounded by the debris of a nearby jet, see fig. 16)

\(\bullet\) central jets rejection: \(\forall|\eta_{jet}|<\)3, \(p_{T(jet)}<\)25 GeV

This lattest cut doesn't reduce the signal much because its only source of jet is an initial-state gluon radiation (see fig.20) whilst for some backgrounds one can have both initial and final-state QCD radiation plus jets coming from the cascade decay, like the b-jets in the \(t\bar{t}\) decays for instance.

This set of cuts, used for the Technical Proposal will be referred to as TP cuts.

[FIGURE:S

Figure 20: The initial-state gluon radiation is the only source of (soft) jets for the signal.

**V. MSSM trileptons versus SM trileptons.**

The question we try to answer here is wether the ATLAS detector will be able to detect an excess in the trilepton rates (due to the MSSM) with respect to the SM predictions after one year of run at low luminosity (\(10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\)) at high (14 TeV) or low (9 TeV) energy. So we consider here all the MSSM trileptons sources as the signal and the standard ones as backgrounds.

The tables below contain the production cross-sections in pb, the remaining cross-sections in fb and the expected number of events (taking in account the \(e(3l)=72.9\%\) trilepton identification efficiency) after one year of LHC run at low luminosity. The results, presented for the TP cuts, are given in the tables and curves below.

Tables 4,5,6: SUSY processes cross-sections for \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) =500 GeV (top),

for \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) =600 GeV (middle) and SM backgrounds cross-sections (bottom).

We obtained similar results for \(m_{\tilde{q}}=2m_{\tilde{g}}\) and derived the plots of figure 21 for the statistical significances. As one can see on figure 21 (right), a low mass top merely alters those statistical significances.

**2. Results at low energy.**

For a staged LHC machine starting to operate at \(\sqrt{s}=9\) TeV, we calculated the statistical significances excatly in the same manner just replacing the high energy cross-sections by the low energy ones and the results appear on figure 27 (left).

The conclusions on this part are the following:

\(\bullet\) at high energy one can easily detect the excess in the trilepton rates coming from the MSSM after one year of run at low luminosity for a gluino mass ranging from 200 to 600 GeV for \(m_{\tilde{q}}=m_{\tilde{g}}+20\) GeV; for \(m_{\tilde{q}}=2m_{\tilde{g}}\) one obtains the same results up to \(m_{\tilde{g}}=500\) GeV and it would take a little less than three years (2.97 \(\times 10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\)) in these conditions to observe that effect at 5\(\sigma\) for \(m_{\tilde{g}}=600\) GeV.

\(\bullet\) at low energy one cannot claim there's any sizeable excess of trileptons (with this set of cuts).

**VI. Extracting the \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{0}\longrightarrow 3l\) channel.**

Now we'd like to extract specific informations on the \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{0}\) leptonic decays to see wether it will be possible to evaluate their masses and have some insights into the MSSM parameters. Hence, by now we consider the \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{0}\longrightarrow 3l+p_{T}^{miss}\) as the signal and all the trileptons sources of the SM and the MSSM (other than the signal) as backgrounds. For this purpose let's examine a few distributions based on the following kinematical variables:

* ptmiss (the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) of each event),
* m3l (the invariant mass of the three leptons system) and
* \(E_{T}\) (the events "scalar transverse energy" defined as the sum of the three leptons \(p_{T}\) plus each event \(p_{T}^{miss}\)). The plots in figures 22-23, 25-27 and 33-34 have all the same structure: the first one displays the distribution dsigma/dptmiss (in pb/10 GeV) versus \(p_{T}^{miss}\) (in GeV), the second shows dsigma/dm3l (in pb/20 GeV) versus m3l (in GeV) and the third dsigma/dE\({}_{T}\) (in pb/20 GeV) versus \(E_{T}\) in GeV. The plots in figures 22 and 23 clearly show that the TP cuts are unsufficient for the signal to emerge over all the backgrounds for a gluino of 200 or 600 GeV (whilst they're sufficient for \(300<m_{\tilde{g}}<500\) GeV). One can notice on fig. 23 that the SM backgrounds which merely contributes to the total background for low gluino masses tends to dominate at high gluino masses. This is simply due to the fact that the SUSY cross-sections decrease when the gluino mass increases while the SM cross-sections remain constant.

Figure 22: The solid line represents the total background, the dashed curves represents the signal and the dotted one the SM contribution to the background; \(m_{\tilde{g}}=200\) GeV.

Figure 23: As in fig. 22, the signal is the dashed curve; \(m_{\hat{s}}=600\) GeV.

To ensure the visibility of the signal over all the parameter space considered in this analysis we need to harden the cuts. A glance at figure 24 suggests to apply a cut on the jet multiplicity in the events, namely to require a complete jet veto (njet=0).

fig. 24: Jet multiplicities for \(m_{\tilde{g}}=200\) GeV and \(tan(\beta)=2\).

The solid line is the total background and the dashed one the signal.

Indeed on this plot the total background is the solid line and the signal, the dashed one, dominates for njet=0. The distributions including the TP cuts and this lattest one are shown in figures 25 to 27.

The conclusion on this section is essentially that the \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{0}\longrightarrow 3l+p_{T}^{miss}\) is clearly visible over all the backgrounds for a gluino mass ranging from 200 to 500 GeV.

Fig. 25: Here the signal is the solid line, the total background the dashes and the SM contribution is the dots; \(m_{\tilde{s}}=\)200 GeV.

Figure 26: Same as fig. 32; \(m_{\hat{g}}=\)500 GeV.

Figure 27: Same as fig. 22; \(m_{\tilde{g}}=\)600 GeV.

We also wanted to see wether there was an alternative to the njet=0 cut and for this we used the correlation we found between the leptons \(p_{T}\) and the \(p_{T}^{miss}\). If one assumes, as in fig. 28, that the \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\) and the \(\chi_{2}^{0}\) are emitted back-to-back, then the momentum conservation implies:

\[\overrightarrow{p(\chi_{1}^{\pm})}=-\overrightarrow{p(\chi_{2}^{\phi})}\]

\[\sum_{i=1}^{3}\overrightarrow{p(l_{i})}=-\overrightarrow{p(\chi_{1}^{\phi}) }-\overrightarrow{p(\chi_{1}^{\phi})}-\overrightarrow{p(\nu)}\]

, thus

\[\sum_{i=1}^{3}p_{T}(l_{i})=p_{T}^{miss}.\]

We'll denote this last relation: \(p_{T}(l)=p_{T}^{miss}\).

fig. 28: Sketch of the the \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\chi_{2}^{0}\) leptonic DK.

The plots in figures 29 to 31 display this correlation on raw data for different processes and different values of the parameters; whereas figure 32 gives the same information on data that passed the TP cuts.

Figure 29: On the left column there are scatter plots of \(p_{T}(l)\) vs \(p_{T}^{miss}\) and on the right one the difference \(p_{T}(l)-p_{T}^{miss}\) giving a idea of the dispersion of these distributions for the signal.

Respectively from top to bottom and left to right: \(\tilde{g}\tilde{g},\tilde{q}\tilde{g},\tilde{q}\tilde{q},\tilde{G}\tilde{g}, \widetilde{ll}\) and \(\chi^{0}_{2}\chi^{0}_{2}\)Figure 31: The scatter plots of \(p_{T}(l)\) vs \(p_{T}^{miss}\) of SM backgrounds, \(t\overline{t}\) on the top and WZ, ZZ on the bottom.

Thus we applied the TP cuts with \(\forall|\eta_{jet}|<\)3, \(p_{T(jet)}<\)100 GeV (instead of 25 GeV), \(p_{T}(l)=p_{T}^{miss}\pm\) 10 GeV and 10 \(<p_{T}^{miss}<\) 150 GeV (where the lower limit tends to eliminate the ZZ background and the higher the MSSM strong processes). The results appear on the distributions of figures 33 and 34 that show this set of cuts isn't much more efficient than the TP cuts (and so reveal the importance of the complete jet veto in this analysis).

**VII. Mass relations in the \(\chi_{i}^{\pm}\chi_{j}^{0}\) sector.**

Now that we've ensured the signal detectability, we can address the problem of evaluating the charginos and neutralinos masses as well as the MSSM parameters values. This analysis, besides the implicit constraint \(m_{\tilde{q}}<600\) GeV (necessary for the signal to be observable), doesn't provide any method for the direct measurement of the \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\chi_{2}^{0}\) masses but, as we'll try to illustrate, can give interesting informations on one parameter of the sector. We've tried two ways to obtain these informations. The first one [9] is based on the maximum of the leptons \(p_{T}\) distribution in the \(\chi_{2}^{0}\longrightarrow l^{+}l^{-}+\chi_{1}^{0}\) decay. This leads to a relation between the \(\chi_{1}^{0}\) and \(\chi_{2}^{0}\) masses:

\[p_{T}^{max}=(m^{2}(\chi_{2}^{0})-m^{2}(\chi_{1}^{0}))/4m^{2}(\chi_{2}^{0}).\]

This relation (well suited for heavy gluinos) reproduces the theoretical expectations with an error varying between a few percents and 30 %, so we didn't use it. We rather used (as proposed in [8]) the fact that in the \(\chi_{2}^{0}\) leptonic decay the dileptons invariant mass has an upper limit which is \(m_{\chi_{2}^{0}}-m_{\chi_{1}^{0}}\). And it turns out that measuring the largest \(m_{l^{+}l^{-}}\) value gives a quite precise determination of the \(\chi_{2}^{0}\) and \(\chi_{1}^{0}\) mass splitting. This can be seen on figures 35-36 and 38 for which we've selected \(l^{+}l^{-}l^{\prime}\) (\(e^{+}e^{-}\mu^{\pm}\) or \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}e^{\pm}\)) events which passed the cuts: TP + njet=0. The top plot shows the \(m_{l^{+}l^{-}}\) invariant mass distribution for the signal plus the total background whilst the bottom one shows this distribution for the signal alone. It seems very easy to measure \(m_{l^{+}l^{-}}^{max}\) up to a gluino mass of 400 GeV.

Figure 35: Dilepton invariant mass distributions for \(m_{\tilde{g}}=200\) GeV and \(tan(\beta)=2\).

For \(m_{\tilde{g}}=500\) GeV, \(m_{l+l-}^{max}\) seems still visible: it is the last dip before the \(Z^{0}\) rise.

[FIGURE:SFinally, for \(m_{\tilde{g}}=600\) GeV, the \(m_{t+l^{-}}\) maximum stands right under the \(Z^{0}\) peak (as shown on figure 37) and is therefore not measurable because of the \(m_{Z^{0}}\) cut (as shown on figure 38).

fig. 37: Dilepton invariant mass distributions for the signal (dash) and the total background (solid). No cuts are applied and \(m_{\tilde{g}}=600\) GeV and \(tan(\beta)=2\).

Figure 38: Same as fig. 42 for \(m_{\tilde{g}}=600\) GeV and \(tan(\beta)=2\); one can see the effect of the cut around the \(Z^{0}\) peak.

The precision in the determination of \(m_{\chi^{0}_{4}}-m_{\chi^{0}_{4}}\) corresponds exactly to that of the \(m_{i^{\prime}+l^{-}}\) measurement. For instance, we've chosen here a binning of 1 GeV for the \(m_{i^{\prime}+l^{-}}\) distribution and checked that \(m_{i^{\prime}+l^{-}}^{max}\) reproduces the theoretical values of \(m_{\chi^{0}_{4}}-m_{\chi^{0}_{4}}\) with an error smaller than the binning; and we can claim it is valid for \(200<m_{\tilde{g}}<500\) GeV. Over all the parameter space considered here, the \(\chi^{0}_{2}\) and \(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\) are almost mass degenerated (\(m_{\chi^{0}_{4}}-m_{\chi^{0}_{4}}<2\) GeV for \(\mu=-m_{\tilde{g}}\), \(m_{\tilde{q}}=m_{\tilde{g}}+20\) GeV or \(m_{\tilde{q}}=2m_{\tilde{g}}\), \(tan(\beta)=2\) or \(20\) and \(200<m_{\tilde{g}}<600\) GeV). Hence \(m_{i^{\prime}+l^{-}}^{max}\) also gives a good approximation of \(m_{\chi^{\pm}_{1}}-m_{\chi^{0}_{4}}\). We also found an interesting relation between \(m_{i^{\prime}+l^{-}}^{max}\) and \(m_{\tilde{g}}\): for given values of \(\mu\) and \(tan(\beta)\) they are proportionnal. This holds for \(300\leq m_{\tilde{g}}\leq 600\) GeV if \(tan(\beta)=2\) and for \(250\leq m_{\tilde{g}}\leq 600\) GeV if \(tan(\beta)=20\) as shown on figures 39 and 40.

Using the theoretical values of \(m_{\chi^{0}_{2}}-m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\) taken with a precision of 1 GeV, we've chosen a few examples to illustrate this:

(a) for \(tan(\beta)=\)2, \(\mu=-m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(m_{\tilde{q}}=m_{\tilde{g}}+\)20 GeV, we found

\[m_{\tilde{g}}=7.865169\times m_{i+i-}^{max}-104\ GeV\]

with a coefficient of linear correlation COR = 0.9955,

(b) for \(tan(\beta)=\)2, \(\mu=-m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(m_{\tilde{q}}=2m_{\tilde{g}}\),

\[m_{\tilde{g}}=8.436689\times m_{i+i-}^{max}-113\ GeV\]

and COR = 0.9935,

(c) for \(tan(\beta)=\)20, \(\mu=-m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(m_{\tilde{q}}=m_{\tilde{g}}+\)20 GeV,

\[m_{\tilde{g}}=6.328100\times m_{i+i-}^{max}+60\ GeV\]

and COR = 0.9999 and

(d) for \(tan(\beta)=\)20, \(\mu=-m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(m_{\tilde{q}}=2m_{\tilde{g}}\),

\[m_{\tilde{g}}=20/3\times m_{i+i-}^{max}+200/3\ GeV\]

and COR = 1.

So one can evaluate \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) provided on one hand that one has determined the values of the slope and the y-intercept as a function of \(\mu\) and especially of \(tan(\beta)\) and on the other hand that \(m_{i+i-}^{max}\) is measurable for these parameters values. Besides, it turns out that, for large values of \(|\mu|\) (\(|\mu|\geq\) 250-300 GeV), \(m_{\chi^{0}_{2}}-m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\) varies very slowly with \(\mu\) as shown in figures 41 and 42.

In summary we can say that in general \(m_{\chi^{0}_{2}}-m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\) depends on three parameters:

\(\bullet\)\(m_{\tilde{g}}\), on which it depends linearly for \(300<m_{\tilde{g}}<500\) GeV,

\(\bullet\)\(\mu\), on which it is almost independent (for the large values of \(|\mu|\)) and

\(\bullet\)\(tan(\beta)\), which value (at least approximate) should be provided by the MSSM higgses searches (which sector depends on the two parameters \(m_{A^{0}}\) and \(tan(\beta)\) at the tree level at least).

Figure 42: \(m_{\chi^{2}_{2}}-m_{\chi^{2}_{1}}\) vs \(\mu\) for \(m_{\tilde{g}}=400\) GeV, \(tan(\beta)=2\), \(20\) and \(m_{\tilde{q}}=2m_{\tilde{g}}\). It shows that this mass splitting is independent of the relation between \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(m_{\tilde{q}}\) as one could expect.

## VIII. Conclusions.

As general conclusions we can remind first that the trilepton signals expected from the MSSM are clearly visible over the SM backgrounds for \(200<m_{\tilde{g}}<600\) GeV, \(\mu=-m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(tan(\beta)=\)2 and 20 (cause the signal inclusive cross-section is of the same order in this case).

The second point is that the particular \(\chi_{2}^{0}\chi_{1}^{\pm}\to 3l+p_{T}^{miss}\) process can be extracted from the SM and the MSSM backgrounds for \(200<m_{\tilde{g}}<500\) GeV.

What's more the sharp cut-off in the dileptons invariant mass of the \(l^{+}l^{-}l^{\prime}\) events provides a precise measurement of \(m_{\chi_{2}^{0}}-m_{\chi_{1}^{0}}\) (and a approximate one of \(m_{\chi_{2}^{\pm}}-m_{\chi_{2}^{0}}\)) and this measurement could consitute a determination of the gluino mass in the range 300 up to 500 GeV provided that \(|\mu|\) is large enough and that we can get the value of \(tan(\beta)\) from the study of the higgs sector of the model.

This analysis would of course need some refinements essentially by including a better parametrization of the sub-detectors resolutions.

To extrapolate these results at high luminosity we'll take in account the pile-up and modify the thresholds of the jet reconstruction algorithm as well as the one of the lepton isolation.

It would also be interesting to redo this work in the framework of the minimal SUGRA model which has fewer parameters.

## Appendix

This appendix is meant to present a quick overview of some common features and the main differences between the MSSM and the minimal SUGRA model. For more detailed reviews one can refer to [1,10-12]. These two models share most of their theoretical basis: the SM gauge group, a minimal particles content, the R-parity conservation,... In constructing these models, one avoids the very complicated and still open question of the SUSY breaking. One usually divides the lagrangian into a SUSY part \({\cal L}_{SUSY}\) (which is global at the EW scale) and a part \({\cal L}_{SOFT}\) containing terms that explicitly break SUSY but softly (i.e. without introducing quadratic divergences): \({\cal L}={\cal L}_{SUSY}+{\cal L}_{SOFT}\). \({\cal L}_{SOFT}\) parametrizes the unknown SUSY breaking mechanism. The MSSM is then thought of as an effective low energy model of a SUGRA-GUT or a superstring theory in which the SUSY breaking can be consistently implemented, unlike in the global SUSY models. \({\cal L}_{SOFT}\) contains a lot of arbitrary parameters, so, to give some predictivity to the model, one assumes that Grand Unification appears at the scale \(M_{GUT}\) (or \(M_{Pl}\)). The SUSY breaking is supposed to take place in the hidden sector and to be communicated to the visible one by gravitational interactions. Gravitation being flavor and charge independent, this results in the following conditions at \(M_{GUT}\):

* a common gaugino mass \(m_{1/2}\),
* a common scalar mass \(m_{0}\),
* a common trilinear coupling term \(A_{0}\) and
* a common bilinear coupling term \(B_{0}\).

Then the masses and couplings of all the sparticles at the scale \(M_{W}\) can be derived by solving RGE with the preceding boundary conditions and also taking in account the top mass. In the MSSM one ends up with the five basic parameters:

* \(\mu\): the higgsino mass term (which is a free parameter),
* \(m_{0}\sim m_{\tilde{q}}\): the universal'sfermion mass,
* \(m_{1/2}\sim m_{\tilde{q}}\): the universal gaugino mass,
* \(m_{A_{4}}\): the pseudo-scalar higgs mass and
* \(tan(\beta)\): the ratio of the two higgs doublets vevs;

plus the bilinear and trilinear couplings A and B (A will be set null at \(M_{W}\) even though it can have non-zero values at \(M_{GUT}\)). In the minimal SUGRA model (that some authors consider as the MSSM) one can in addition explain the EW symmetry breaking by evolving the two higgs doublets masses from \(M_{GUT}\) down to \(M_{W}\): the squared mass of \(\Phi_{2}\) is driven negative, what's more convincing than introducing "by hand" the negative squared mass of the lone higgs doublet in the SM. Along this procedure one can substitute the values of \(B_{0}\) and \(tan(\beta)\) and fix the absolute value of \(\mu\) by imposing to recover the measured \(Z^{0}\) mass. Finally, one ends up with four parameters: \(m_{0}\), \(m_{1/2}\), A, \(tan(\beta)\) and the sign of \(\mu\). To summarize: both models share the same foundations but the minimal SUGRA model goes beyond the MSSM in explaining the EW symmetry breaking and so imposes more relations between the soft-breaking terms.
