###### Abstract

The ATLAS collaboration aims at performing a wide program of B-physics studies at the LHC. In particular, the search for CP violation in B decays (\(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\to\mathrm{J}/\psi\)\(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\), \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{d}}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\to\mathrm{J}/\psi\)\(\phi\)) and its measurement will be pursued. Other relevant topics will be the measurement of \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\) mixing, the search for rare B decays and the spectroscopy of B hadrons.

## 1 Introduction

The LHC machine, given its high centre-of-mass energy (14 TeV) and luminosity, is a genuine beauty factory. The \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) production cross section is \(\sigma\simeq 0.5\) mb, about 1% of the total inelastic cross section, 10 times larger than at the Tevatron Collider. The production asymmetry, though not negligible, is small (\(\sim 1\%\)). At the luminosity that will be delivered during the initial stage of the machine, \(L\simeq 1\times 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), about 3\(\times 10^{12}\) beauty events/year are produced. At this luminosity, event pile-up is not a major consideration.

The ATLAS detector [1] is primarily optimized for high-luminosity LHC physics. However, the B-physics accessible in the initial running of the machine is influencing the design. In particular, the level-1 muon trigger can operate with a transverse momentum threshold as low as 6 GeV/c (the transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is measured with respect to the beamline). Besides, a vertex detector at low radius from the beamline has been added to the central tracker. Furthermore, the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) allows electron identification down to very low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

The level-1 trigger is delivered by the muon system selecting events with muons of transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>\)6 GeV/c; the corresponding trigger rate is 8 kHz, with a \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) purity of about 60%. Higher-level triggers select specific B-decay channels.

## 2 The ATLAS Detector

The ATLAS detector is based on an air-core toroid system, capable of muon identification for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>\) 5 GeV/c in the barrel (lower in the endcaps) with excellent standalone momentum resolution \(\Delta p/p\simeq 2\%\) for muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>\)10 GeV/c.

The muon magnetic surrounds the barrel hadron calorimeter made of iron and scintillator tiles. The measured energy resolution for charged hadrons is \(\sigma(E)/E=47\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 2.3\%\) (\(E\) measured in GeV). This detector also has a (limited) capability to identify muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>\) 3 GeV/c. The hadron calorimeter in the endcaps is based on Liquid Argon (LAr) technology to withstand the high radiation level in the forward region. Again, the absorber material is iron.

The electromagnetic calorimeter uses lead absorber and the LAr ionization technique is implemented in an "accordion" geometry, both for the barrel and for the endcaps. The measured electron energy resolution is \(\sigma(E)/E=0.35\%\oplus 10\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 0.28/E\) (\(E\) in GeV). A preshower detector is integrated in the electromagnetic calorimeter.

The Central Tracker, crucial for B-physics, is presented in the next section.

### The Central Tracker

The ATLAS inner detector is shown in Fig. 1. It occupiesthe cylindrical cavity defined by the boundaries of the electromagnetic calorimeter cryostats, with a radius \(R=115\) cm and \(|\mu|\)=345 cm. The cavity is enclosed in a solenoid with an axial field of 2 T; the superconducting coil is integrated in the cryostat of the barrel calorimeter.

The beam pipe, 0.3 \(X_{0}\) thick at normal incidence, has a diameter of about 5 cm.

The layout of the inner detector makes use of a combination of a few high-precision, high-granularity layers in the inner part of the tracker, and straw tubes in the outer part which supply a large number of measurements on the track trajectories. This concept offers the benefits of a robust and safe pattern recognition through the large number of "continuous" track measurements, together with precise momentum measurement using the high-precision points.

Four detector types are employed:

* Pixel detectors are used nearest to the beam pipe. The ATLAS pixel system includes two barrel layers and eight disk layers to provide at least two points for tracks with \(|\eta|<2.5\). The barrel pixel layers use 50 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 300\(\mu\)m pixel size and are placed at radii \(R=11.5\) cm and \(R=16.5\) cm. The space resolution in the \(R-\phi\) plane is \(\sigma(R-\phi)=14\)\(\mu\)m; the space resolution along the beam direction is \(\sigma(z)\)=87 \(\mu\)m.
* Strip detectors are used for the large area precision trackers. High precision is obtained in the \(R-\phi\) plane in both the barrel and the forward regions. A lower precision is acceptable in the non-bending plane and this is obtained by the use of small-angle stereo, which also gives a low fraction of ambiguous hits. Silicon detectors are foreseen in the barrel region, with GaAs substrates used in the region of highest fluence of the forward system, exploiting their high radiation tolerance. Four silicon layers are placed in the barrel at radii \(R=30,40,50\) and 60 cm. The strip size is 75 (or 112) \(\mu\)m\(\times\)12 cm. The space resolution per layer in the bending plane is \(\sigma\)=15 \(\mu\)m; in the non-bending plane \(\sigma\)=770 \(\mu\)m.
* Straw tubes are used at large radii (60 cm \(<R<110\) cm, in the barrel) where the track density is relatively low. With at least 35 points per track, the pattern recognition is robust. The single-tube space resolution is \(\sigma\simeq 170\)\(\mu\)m. Radiators are included to generate transition radiation which gives electron-identification capability for \(p_{\rm T}>\)1 GeV/c; this is of particular importance for electron identification in the level-2 trigger, where the identification of J/\(\psi\rightarrow\) e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\)is used to enlarge the \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\rightarrow\rm J/\psi\)\(\rm K^{0}_{S}\) event sample.
* A vertex detector is included at radius \(R=4\) to 6 cm, to enhance significantly the vertex-finding capability for B-physics during the first few years of LHC operation. This layer is foreseen as either an additional pixel layer (50 \(\mu\)m\(\times\)300 \(\mu\)m pixel size; \(R=4\) cm) or a double-sided silicon-strip layer (\(R=6\) cm). The space resolution is about 15 \(\mu\)m in the bending projection, and below 100 \(\mu\)m in the other projection.

The transverse-momentum resolution of the ATLAS central tracker is expressed by the formula

\[\sigma(p_{\rm T})/p_{\rm T}=(5\times 10^{-4}p_{\rm T}\oplus 1.2)\times 10^{-2} \tag{1}\]

(\(p_{\rm T}\) measured in GeV/c; the effect of misalignment is not considered).

The ATLAS tracker has no hadron-identification capability (\(\pi\)/K separation). This has a relevant impact on the analysis of the \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) process, as will be shown later in this paper.

## 3 The ATLAS B-physics trigger

The ATLAS trigger is organized in three levels. The first-level trigger for B-physics is delivered by the muon system with the selection of events with \(p_{\rm T}>\)6 GeV/c muons in the pseudorapidity region \(|\eta|<\)2.2. The muon trigger system is based on dedicated, fast response, high-granularity detectors (Resistive Plate Counters in the barrel; Thin Gap Chambers in the end-caps). The low-\(p_{\rm T}\) muon trigger requires the coincidence within a road with a 3/4 majority between two trigger detectors doublets. The coincidence is required for the two projections (the bending and the non-bending planes of the muon system). A tight time coincidence \(\Delta t<\)20 ns is also required in order to identify the bunch crossing and to reduce the fake-trigger rate. The efficiency curves for different \(p_{\rm T}\)-thresholds are presented in Fig. 1.

With a 6 GeV/c threshold the expected trigger rate is 8 kHz; the event sample selected is 60% bb, 20% c\(\overline{\rm c}\) and 20% of \(\pi\)/K decay background.

In the second level trigger high-\(p_{\rm T}\) tracks are reconstructed in the inner detector; therefore different trigger criteria are applied for each process considered for physics analysis. In general, the rate after the second level is around 1 kHz.

Finally, in the third-level trigger, a detailed event reconstruction is performed.

## 4 Event simulation and reconstruction of \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi\,K^{0}_{S}\)

The beauty final states are complex: only a few of them can be completely reconstructed in ATLAS. The channel \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi\,K^{0}_{S}\) is of particular interest as the reconstruction of \(\rm K^{0}_{S}\) and \(J/\psi\) is simple even in experiments at hadron machines.

If not explicitly stated otherwise, B-physics processes, including initial and final state QCD radiation, hadronization and decays were simulated using the PYTHIA Monte Carlo program [2].

The reconstruction of \(\rm K^{0}_{S}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) decays has been studied using a full GEANT detector simulation [3]. Two oppositely charged pions with \(p_{\rm T}\!>\!0.5\) GeV/c are required in the pseudorapidity region \(|\eta|<\)2.5; the two-track distance of closest approach is required to be \(d<0.5\) cm and the decay radius must be in the interval 1 cm \(<R_{d}<50\) cm. The \(\rm K^{0}_{S}\) mass resolution is 3 MeV/c\({}^{2}\) to 6 MeV/c\({}^{2}\), depending on the decay radius. The reconstruction efficiency is estimated to be larger than 95% for \(R_{d}<30\) cm and larger than 85% up to \(R_{d}=50\) cm. The fraction of fake \(\rm K^{0}_{S}\) is about 10% at \(L=10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\); it gets worse at higher luminosity.

Two oppositely charged leptons are required to initiate the \(\rm J/\psi\to t^{+}t^{-}\) search. For the decay \(\rm J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) the electrons are accepted if both have \(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV/c (\(|\eta|<2.2\)); concerning the decay \(\rm J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), the two muons must have \(p_{\rm T}>5\) GeV/c and \(p_{\rm T}>3\) GeV/c respectively (may be identified in the hadron calorimeter). The distance of closest approach between the two lepton candidates forming the \(\rm J/\psi\) is required to be \(d<100\,\mu\)m. The distance in the transverse plane of the \(\rm J/\psi\) decay vertex from the primary vertex is required to be larger than 250 \(\mu\)m. The \(\rm J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) mass resolution is about 40 MeV/c\({}^{2}\). The \(\rm J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) reconstructed mass shows a quite significant tail at mass values lower than the nominal \(\rm J/\psi\) mass. This is because of electron bremsstrahlung effects, due to the material present in the central detector. It has been shown, in a detailed GEANT simulation study, that a bremsstrahlung fit reduces the tail size significantly [4]. After bremsstrahlung recovery the \(\rm J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) mass resolution is about 90 MeV/c\({}^{2}\).

The track impact parameter to the primary vertex is measured with high accuracy if the vertex detector is used. The space resolution is better than 70 \(\mu\)m for \(p_{\rm T}\!>1\) GeV/c and it improves to 20 \(\mu\)m for \(p_{\rm T}\!>10\) GeV/c. Without this detector layer the resolution would be worse by a factor 2\(\div\)3.

In the physics analysis, the reconstruction efficiencies were taken to be 0.95 for charged hadrons (e.g. pions from \(\rm K^{0}_{S}\) decays) and 0.80 for electrons and muons (includes trigger efficiency). Muons with \(p_{\rm T}\) in the range 3\(\div\)5 GeV/c, identified in the calorimeter, were used only if they were accompanied by a second muon with \(p_{\rm T}\!>5\) GeV/c, where the pair was consistent with the decay \(\rm J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). These assumptions have been checked using full simulation and event reconstruction.

Unless stated otherwise, the results here presented are based on a total integrated luminosity

## 5 CP-violation search in the B-system

In order to present the approach to the study of CP violation in B systems, let us consider the decay \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\,K_{S}^{0}}\) as an example. Ideally,

\(\mathrm{N}\bigl{(}\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\,K_{S}^{0}}\bigr{)}\propto e^{- \Gamma t}\bigl{(}1\pm\sin 2\beta\sin\bigl{(}\Delta m\,t\bigr{)}\bigr{)}\), where the sign depends on the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\) flavour; \(t\) is the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\) proper decay time, \(\Delta m\) is the difference between the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}}\) mass eigenvalues and \(\beta\) is one of the inner angles in the CKM unitarity triangle. The corresponding time-dependent asymmetry is therefore

\[A\bigl{(}t\bigr{)}=\frac{\mathrm{N}(+,\mathrm{t})-\mathrm{N}(-,\mathrm{t})}{ \mathrm{N}(+,\mathrm{t})+\mathrm{N}(-,\mathrm{t})}=\sin 2\beta\sin\bigl{(}\Delta m\,t \bigr{)}; \tag{2}\]

its amplitude is a direct measure of the \(\sin 2\beta\) parameter. In the time integrated method [5], the asymmetry is "diluted" by the factor \(D_{\mathrm{int}}\!=\!x_{d}\) /(1+\(x_{d}\)\({}^{2}\)): A =\(D_{\mathrm{int}}\sin 2\beta\), where \(x_{d}=\Delta m/\Gamma\); if \(x_{d}=\)0.71 [6], then \(D_{\mathrm{int}}\!=\)0.47.

The flavour of the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\,K_{S}^{0}}\) system at production is established by tagging the charge oflepton produced in the semileptonic decay of the other b-quark in the event. This lepton can be the trigger muon or an electron, in which case the trigger muon is produced by the decay \(\mathrm{J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\). Several processes lead to a wrong-charge tag:

* the tag lepton can be produced by \(\mathrm{b\to c\to\mu}\) decay;
* the tag can be from a neutral B meson that oscillates before decaying, changing its flavour;
* the lepton can be produced by extra b or quarks in the event, or by pion/kaon decays;

These effects are summarized by another dilution factor \(D_{\mathrm{tag}}\!=\)1-2W, where W is the wrong-tag fraction. For lepton tags with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\!>\)6 GeV/c, \(D_{\mathrm{tag}}\!=\)0.56 (assuming \(x_{d}=\)0.69, \(x_{s}=\)10, u:d:s:baryons = 40:40:12:8). For lower transverse momentum thresholds the tagging dilution deteriorates; therefore this trigger threshold is well matched to physics.

Background also dilutes the observed asymmetry; this effect is represented by another dilution factor, \(D_{\mathrm{back}}\!=\)N\({}_{s}\) /N\({}_{\mathrm{tot}}\), where N\({}_{s}\) is the number of the signal events and N\({}_{\mathrm{tot}}\) is total number of events (signal + background).

A small production asymmetry, \(A_{p}\!\simeq\)1%, is to be expected because of the pp initial state. This asymmetry can be measured using control samples which are expected not to exhibit any CP asymmetry. For example, in the case of the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\,K_{S}^{0}}\) suitable control processes are \(\mathrm{B^{\pm}\to J/\psi\,K^{\pm}}\) and \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\,K^{*}}\). Furthermore, an independent asymmetry could be generated by a tiny bias introduced by the level-1 muon trigger, when the trigger muon is also the tag lepton. In addition to the above processes, dimuon events selected with the inclusive muon trigger can be used to measure the trigger bias.

In conclusion, the measured asymmetry is related to CP-violation through the relation:

\[\mathrm{A}=D_{\mathrm{tag}}D_{\mathrm{back}}\bigl{(}D_{\mathrm{int}}\sin 2 \beta\ +\ A_{p}\bigr{)} \tag{3}\]

For small asymmetries (A \(\ll\)1) the statistical error on \(\sin 2\beta\) is

\[\delta\bigl{(}\sin 2\beta\bigr{)}\simeq\frac{1}{D_{\mathrm{tag}}D_{\mathrm{int}} \sqrt{D_{\mathrm{back}}}\sqrt{N_{s}}} \tag{4}\]

This error can be improved with a "time-dependent" analysis. With the same data sample, the statistical error on \(\sin 2\beta\) can be reduced by about 25%. Furthermore, the time-dependent analysis checks that the time dependence of the asymmetry is as expected (this is, however, more complicated for the \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}}\) process).

### CP-Violation in the process \(\mathrm{B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi\,K_{S}^{0}}\)

Three data sample are considered:

* muon tag, \(\mathrm{J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}}\) ;
* muon tag, \(\mathrm{J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) ;
* electron tag, \(\mathrm{J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\) ;

The first level trigger is provided by the muon system. The second-level trigger selection is made by requiring:

* additional muon: \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\!>\)5 GeV/c, \(|\eta|<\)2.5; or
* electron (tag): \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\!>\)5 GeV/c, \(|\eta|<\)2.5; or
* e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) pair with electron \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\!>\)1 GeV/c, \(|\eta|<\)2.5.

The trigger rate after the second level is about 600 Hz, dominated by the dielectron selection. The same trigger selects the control sample events.

At the analysis stage the \(\rm K^{0}_{S}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) and \(\rm J/\psi\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) candidates are required to have the nominal mass within \(\pm 2\sigma\). Furthermore, the proper decay time of the \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) system is required to be larger than 0.5 ps. As shown in Fig. 2, the \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) mass is reconstructed with a resolution \(\sigma\)=18 MeV/c\({}^{2}\) (\(\rm J/\psi\) and \(\rm K^{0}_{S}\) are constrained to have their nominal masses). The expected number of signal events in a one-year run (\(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)) is about 22000; the background level is about 2600 events.

The statistical error is \(\delta(\sin 2\beta)=0.020\) with a time-integrated analysis [7]; it is reduced to \(\delta(\sin 2\beta)=0.018\) if a time-dependent analysis is performed.

The expected high B-purity at LHC explains the large signal-to-background ratio for this channel. Already at the Tevatron-collider energy \(\sqrt{s}\)=1.8 TeV, CDF sees a very clean inclusive \(\rm J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) signal. The presence of a \(\rm J/\psi\) originating from a displaced vertex and accompanied by an extra lepton acts as a b-tag and brings the non-beauty background to negligible level.

The main source of background is accidental coincidence of genuine \(\rm J/\psi\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) and \(\rm K^{0}_{S}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) originating from fragmentation of the b-jet. Other background sources are genuine \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) decays to \(\rm J/\psi\)\(\rm K^{0}_{S}\)\(\rm X\), or \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) decays to \(\rm J/\psi\)\(\rm K^{+}\pi^{-}\), where the charged kaon is used in the analysis as a pion. The first type of background peaks below the \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\) mass, while the second is suppressed by mass and decay-length cuts on the \(\rm K^{0}_{S}\).

### Experimental control of systematic errors

The error on \(\sin 2\beta\) depends on several experimental uncertainties [8]:

\[\delta(\sin 2\beta)^{\rm sys}\simeq\ \left[\sin^{2}2\beta\left(\frac{ \delta D^{2}_{\rm tag}}{D^{2}_{\rm tag}}+\frac{\delta D^{2}_{\rm back}}{D^{2}_ {\rm back}}+\right.\right.\] \[\left.\left.+\frac{\delta D^{2}_{\rm int}}{D^{2}_{\rm int}}\right) \right.+\frac{\delta A^{2}_{\rm p}}{D^{2}_{\rm int}}\right]^{1/2} \tag{5}\]

The dilution factor \(D_{\rm tag}\) can be measured with the channel \(\rm B^{\pm}\rightarrow\rm J/\psi\)\(\rm K^{\pm}\) with lepton tag, by comparing the kaon charge with the charge of the tag lepton. The number of signal events in a one-year run is expected to be about 96000, with a background of about 6600 events, as shown in Fig. 3a). If \(\rm W\)=0.22, \(\delta D_{\rm tag}/D_{\rm tag}\)=5\(\times 10^{-3}\).

Concerning \(D_{\rm back}\), allowing a conservative assumption on the relative error of the number of background events \(\delta N_{\rm b}/N_{\rm b}\)=10 %, we have \(\delta D_{\rm back}/D_{\rm back}\)=1.1\(\times\)\(10^{-2}\).

Using the measured value \(x_{d}=\)(0.71\(\pm\)0.06) [6] and a proper lifetime cut \(t>\)0.5 ps, the resulting error on \(D_{\rm int}\) is \(\delta D_{\rm int}/D_{\rm int}\)=1.3\(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\). However the errors will be certainly be reduced by 200.

The last error source is the uncertainty on the production (and trigger system) asymmetry \(A_{\rm p}\). The decay mode \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\rightarrow\rm J/\psi\)\(\rm K^{*}\), \(\rm K^{*}\rightarrow\rm K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}\) (expected not to be CP-violating) measures directly the asymmetry due to the \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\overline{\rm B}^{0}_{d}\) production and to the bias introduced by the trigger system. The event sample is predicted to be made of about 28000 signal and 5600 background events, as shown in Fig. 3b). This corresponds to an error \(\delta A_{\rm p}\)=7\(\times 10^{-3}\). It is also possible to use the process \(\rm B^{\pm}\rightarrow\rm J/\psi\)\(\rm K^{\pm}\) to cross-check the result and reduce its error; however, an extrapolation of the measurement with this re

Figure 2: Reconstructed (\(\rm J/\psi\)\(\rm K^{0}_{S}\)) mass. The white histogram shows the signal and the hatched histogram shows the background.

action to B\({}_{\rm d}^{0}\) production is needed, and this adds an extrapolation error.

The systematic error on sin 2\(\beta\) for a one-year run can be written as follows:

\[\delta(\sin\ 2\beta)^{\rm sys}=(1.8\sin\ 2\beta\oplus 1.1)\times 10^{-2}\,; \tag{6}\]

therefore the global systematic and statistical error on \(\delta(\sin\ 2\beta)\) is \(2.1\times 10^{-2}<\delta(\sin\ 2\beta)<2.8\times 10^{-2}\) (depending on the measured value of sin 2\(\beta\)) for an integrated luminosity L= 10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The ultimate error (L = 4 \(\times\) 10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) and negligible error on \(z_{d}\) ) is 1\(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\) to 1.4\(\times\)10\({}^{-2}\).

The theoretical error (due to penguin contribution) is small compared with the experimental error.

### CP-Violation in the process \(\mbox{B}_{\rm d}^{0}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\)

In this channel,the CP-asymmetry is dependent on the angle \(\alpha\) in the unitarity triangle. The estimated branching ratio of this decay is assumed to be less than \(2\times 10^{-5}\). Experimentally this process is more difficult than \(\mbox{B}_{\rm d}^{0}\rightarrow\mbox{J}/\psi\,\mbox{K}_{\rm S}^{0}\) for two reasons: there is no hadron identification in ATLAS and we cannot benefit from the \(\mbox{J}/\psi\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) signature. The secondary vertex signature and mass resolution are important to suppress the background.

The second-level trigger requires an unlike-charge pair of tracks with \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>\)15 GeV/c (\(p_{\rm T}\)\(>\) 6 GeV/c for each track).

In the offline analysis, the pair is required to be consistent with a secondary vertex separated from the primary one by more than 300 \(\mu\)m in the transverse plane; furthermore, the \(\mbox{B}_{\rm d}^{0}\) line of flight is required to be parallel to the transverse momentum within 6\({}^{\circ}\) degrees. Besides, the events are selected if the two-pion mass is within a 1\(\sigma\)-interval (50 MeV/c\({}^{2}\)) around the nominal value.

With these cuts, 7100 signal events and 7000 background events are selected, as shown in Fig. 4. The background is dominated by two-body B-meson or \(\Lambda_{\rm b}\) decays for which one of the final state particles is either a \(\mbox{K}^{\pm}\) or a proton. The reconstructed mass obtained by assigning the nominal \(\pi\) mass to both charged tracks peaks very closely to the nominal \(\mbox{B}_{\rm d}^{0}\) mass. The background estimation is less accurate than in the previous process: the experimental control of the various background sources is difficult and several branching ratios are currently unmeasured. This has a significant impact on the systematic error on sin 2\(\alpha\) because of the small signal-to-background ratio. A study of fake B\({}^{0}\) production (when the B\({}^{0}\) is reconstructed from two charged tracks coming from distinct piled-up events in the same bunch crossing) is in progress; still, we expect this contribution not to be significantly high, because of the kinematical constraints applied in the event selection (in particular, the \(p_{T}\) and the impact parameter cuts).

This situation is complicated by the theoretical uncertainties on the expected CP asymmetry: the penguin diagram contribution complicates the time dependence [9]:

\[A\big{(}t\big{)}=\Lambda_{c}\cos(\Delta m\,t)+\Lambda_{s}\sin(\Delta m\,t) \tag{7}\]

where \(\Lambda_{c}=-2\rho\sin 2\delta\sin\alpha\) and \(\Lambda_{s}=-(\sin 2\alpha+2\rho\cos\delta\cos 2\alpha\sin\alpha)\); \(\rho=A_{P}/A_{T}\) is the ratio of penguin to tree amplitudes (0.2\(\pm\)0.2); \(\delta\) is the strong-phase difference between the tree and the penguin diagrams.

The statistical error on \(\sin 2\alpha\) with the "time-dependent" analysis (one-parameter maximum likelihood fit) is \(\delta\)(sin 2\(\alpha\))=0.045 (assuming \(\rho\)=0.2 and \(\delta\)=\(\pi\)/2 as known values) [10]. An example of time-dependent fit of the CP-asymmetry in this channel is shown in Fig. 5, where \(\sin 2\alpha=0.6\) is used as the input value for the event generation. The error propagation of \(D_{\rm lag}\) and \(D_{\rm back}\) (assuming a 20% relative error on the background level) is \(\delta(\sin 2\alpha)/\sin 2\alpha=0.005\) and \(\delta(\sin 2\alpha)/\sin 2\alpha=0.10\), respectively. The effect of the production asymmetry is \(\delta(\sin 2\alpha)\)=0.007. The global expected experimental error is \(\sin 2\alpha=0.063\oplus 0.10\sin 2\alpha\).

The theoretical error on \(\sin 2\alpha\) caused by the poor knowledge of \(\rho\) and \(\delta\) is \(0.2\div 0.3\).

### CP-Violation in the process \({\bf B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\ \phi}\)

The CP-asymmetry in this channel is related to the third angle \(\gamma\) in the unitarity triangle; however, a small asymmetry is expected in the Standard Model for \({\bf B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\ \phi}\) (about 3%): the observation of a higher asymmetry would indicate the presence of new physics. Because of the high value of \(z_{s}\) the asymmetry measurement is feasible only with a time-dependent analysis (\(D_{\rm int}\)\(<0.1\) for \(z_{s}>\)10). The good time resolution provided by the system (\(\sigma(t)\simeq 0.07\) ps) is well justified by the analysis requirements.

The \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\,\phi\) search [11] is similar to the search of \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi\,K^{0}_{S}\); the \(\phi\) is identified by combining two oppositely-charged tracks with \(\rm p\,r\!>\!0.5\) GeV/c with invariant mass in the range \(1.01\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\div 1.03\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\), having assigned the \(\rm K^{\pm}\) mass. The final selection is made by fitting the \(\rm J/\psi\) and the \(\phi\) to a common vertex. The proper time of the B system is required to be \(t>\!0.5\) ps.

The number of signal events is about 15000 with 2900 background events, as shown in Fig. 6. The statistical error on the decay asymmetry is \(\sigma(A)\)=0.025 if \(x_{s}=\)10; it increases to 0.06 if \(x_{s}=\)25. The systematic error due to \(D_{\rm tag}\) is \(\delta A/A\!=\!0.005\); the error due to background subtraction is \(\delta A/A\!=\!0.016\), assuming 10% uncertainty on the estimated number of background events in the mass window; the effect of production (and trigger) asymmetry is \(\delta A_{p}\simeq\)0.007.

The global experimental error is \(\Delta A\!\simeq\!0.04\) for \(x_{s}=\)10; it increases to \(\Delta A\!\simeq\!0.06\) for \(x_{s}=\)20.

## 6 \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\) mixing

The Standard Model allowed range for \(x_{s}\) is \(5.4\!<\!x_{s}<\!60.2\) at 90% confidence level [12]. The experimental limit on \(x_{s}\) is \(x_{s}>\!9\)[13].

The parameter \(x_{s}\) can be measured by comparing the flavour of the B meson at the decay and the charge of the tag lepton produced by the other B-hadron:

\[A(t)=\frac{dn_{\rm mx}/dt-dn_{\rm nm}/dt}{dn_{\rm mx}/dt+dn_{\rm nm}/dt}=D{\rm cos }(x_{s}t/\tau_{\rm B_{s}}) \tag{8}\]

where \(n_{\rm mx}\) is the number of the events for which mixing occurred and \(n_{\rm nm}\) refers to the number of events with no mixing.

For this measurement the decay \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\to\phi\pi^{-}\pi^{+}\to K^{+}K^{-}\pi^{-}\pi^ {+}\) is considered [14]. The charge combination of the \(\rm D_{s}\) and the \(\pi\) gives the flavour of the neutral \(\rm B_{s}\) meson; the muon tag is used to classify the event.

The event is reconstructed by a progressive vertex fit: first the \(\phi\) system is reconstructed and it is used to reconstruct the D meson. Finally the \(\rm B^{0}_{s}\) candidates, obtained by combining the D meson with the pion, are required to have \(\rm p_{T}\!>\!10\) GeV/c, a proper decay time \(>0.4\) ps and an impact parameter b\(<\)55 \(\mu\)m with respect to the main vertex; the resulting B-meson proper-time resolution is \(\simeq 0.069\) ps, and the corresponding resolution in the transverse decay length is \(\simeq 50\)\(\mu\)m.

The number of expected signal events is 2650; Concerning the background, the following processes have been considered: 1) \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\); 2) \(\rm B^{0}_{d}\to D^{-}\pi^{+}\); 3) \(\rm A_{b}\to\Lambda^{+}_{c}\pi^{-}\). Random combinations are another source of background; no events have been found in \(3.7\times 10^{4}\) inclusive \(\mu\)X events in the mass window 5\(\div 6\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\). Therefore, an upper limit of 1140 events has been used in the analysis.

The measurement error on \(z_{s}\) turns out to be \(\delta(x_{s})=\)0.05 (for \(x_{s}=20\)). The analysis has shown sensitivity up to \(x_{s}\simeq 40\): see Fig. 7.

## 7 Other B-physics topics

Other important B-physics topics have been considered by ATLAS. Among them, it is worth while mentioning:

Figure 6: Reconstructed (\(\rm J/\psi\,\phi\)) mass for signal (white histogram), background from other B decays and combinatorial background from real/fake J/\(\psi\)’s and real \(\phi\)’s (dark histogram); the remaining combinatorial background is shown in the hatched histogram.

* the measurement of the differential cross-section for b-quark production, to be compared with the ones measured by UA1 (\(\sqrt{s}\)=630 GeV) [15] and CDF (\(\sqrt{s}\)=1.8 TeV) [16].
* the search for rare B-decays; the Standard Model predicts very small branching ratios for \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d,s}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) (less than 2.5\(\times 10^{-9}\) for \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{s}\)); The expected sensitivity in ATLAS is about 10\({}^{-8}\) from one year running at low luminosity [17]; these channels can be studied at higher luminosities and the Standard Model limit may be within reach; other channels are under study.
* B-baryon polarization;
* B\({}_{c}\) meson production cross section [18];

## 8 Conclusions

The ATLAS detector is primarily optimized for high-luminosity running. The B-physics requirements are considered in the design; the detector provides a low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) muon trigger, electron identification down to low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and precise vertexing at low radial distance from the beam line. The high centre-of-mass energy and the high initial luminosity delivered by the machine allow one to consider the LHC as a beauty-factory with high signal-to-noise ratio.

The CP asymmetry of B-systems can be measured with good accuracy. With a one-year run at \(L=10^{33}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), \(\sin 2\beta\) is measured with an error \(\delta(\sin 2\beta)\simeq 0.018(\mathrm{stat.})\oplus 0.015(\mathrm{sys.})\); the sensitivity on \(\sin 2\alpha\) is \(\delta(\sin 2\alpha)=0.04\oplus 0.015\) (the first error is statistical and the second comes from experimental systematics). The analysis of \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) is complicated by the large theoretical uncertainties due to the contribution of penguin diagrams, leading to additional systematic errors.

\(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{s}\) mixing can be measured for \(x_{s}\) values up to \(x_{s}\)=4.0.

Other B-physics topics under study in ATLAS are the measurement of b-quark production differential cross section, the search of rare B-decays, the measurement of B\({}_{c}\) mesons and the the measurement of B-baryon polarization.
