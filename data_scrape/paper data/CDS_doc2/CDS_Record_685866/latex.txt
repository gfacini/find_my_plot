**Abstract**

We present results from some simple calculations of the average occupancy and total charge per unit anode length for the 3 cm diameter Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) as a function of pseudorapidity for the Endcap Muon Subsystem. Occupancies at th level of 10% per tube and total charge of \(\approx 1\) C/cm for 10 years of operation are found for a substantial fraction of the Endcaps. We also briefly comment on the desirability of triggering over the entire eta coverage.

## 1 Introduction

A major development in the ATLAS Muon System effort during the last couple of months has been the adoption of the Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) concept as the basic detector for the precision muon measurement in ATLAS. The concept combines the most attractive features of the three candidate technologies that were being pursued in parallel. A description of the MDT concept as well as detailed parameter tables can be found in the May 1994 Progress Report on ATLAS Milestones [1]. Most of the parameters used in this note can be found in these tables. For the purpose of this discussion the basic MDT can be viewed as a drift cell 3 cm in diameter. having aluminum walls 250 \(\mu\)m thick. The operating gas is a mixture of Ar/CO\({}_{2}\)/N\({}_{2}\)/C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{4}\) (86/4/5/5%).

Most of the studies of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer have been concentrating in the barrel section of the system. It is highly desirable (and also it has been the ATLAS philosophy) to use the same technology in the endcap subsystem as well. It is frequently argued, however, that this may not be possible for the entire endcap area because of the very high rates of both decay muons and neutron and photon induced backgrounds. The expected rate at \(\eta=2\). for example, is in excess of 3 kHz/cm\({}^{2}\). In this note we examine two rate related parameters, occupancy and total collected charge as a function of pseudorapidity in a system with 3 cm diameter drift tubes operating at 5 atm of absolute pressure.

The somewhat related issue of triggering in the very forward endcap system (\(\eta>2\)) is examined in the last section of this report. Physics arguments are presented for the desirability of triggering over the entire area covered by the endcap muon system. Triggering at \(\eta>2\) is, of course, most challenging to say the least. A very forward system based on inherently fast multiwire proportional chambers with a highly segmented cathode readout as described in ATLAS Muon-No-38 [2], could provide enough power to make such a trigger feasible while alleviating the problems of occupancy and aging in this region.

The fact that in this technology the same chamber provides both the precision measurement and the trigger functions means that one could, in principle, have six or eight measurements in both coordinates in all three superlayers to use for a robust trigger with efficient background rejection.

## 2 Occupancy Levels in the Endcaps

The mean occupancy per single drift tube is given by:

\[O_{c}=LDr\Delta t\]

where:

L is the length of the drift tube in cm.

D is the tube diameter in cm.

Figure 1: Average occupancy levels per drift tube as a function of pseudorapidity for the three endcap superlayers.

r is the average rate in Hz/cm\({}^{2}\), and

\(\Delta t\) is the maximum drift time in sec.

We used the rates as a function of pseudorapidity and distance from the interaction point as they appear in the Milestones document [1]. It should be emphasized that these rates depend on a specific detector configuration and shielding strategy which may change as ATLAS evolves. This is true especially if the integrated version of the forward calorimeter is adopted. It is unlikely, however, that in a realistic configuration they would be significantly lower. This is particularly true for \(\eta>2\) since the rate of muons from pion and kaon decays in the inner detector account for most of the rate in this region. The length of each tube was calculated at each \(\eta\),Z location assuming an octagonal layout of chambers. Finally the maximum drift time was assumed to be 500 ns and the diameter of the drift tubes equal to 3 cm.

Figure 1 shows the calculated occupancies for the three superlayers. The solid lines are just smooth curves connecting the data points. One may note that, apart from the very forward region, the average occupancy per tube as a function of pseudorapidity remains relatively constant as the tubes become longer while the background rates decrease.

Total Accumulated Charge per Unit Wire Length

Aging of wire chambers, usually not a concern in muon systems, may become a problem at LHC luminosities. Aging effects are directly proportional to the total accumulated charge per unit wire length. They also depend, among other factors, on the gas used. Although there is no consensus on the exact value of total charge that can be tolerated, most experts would agree that for precision measurements and for gases not containing significant amounts of CF4 the charge limit is of the order of one Coulomb per centimeter over the life of the detector.

The total charge per centimeter of wire length accumulated over one year of operation is given by:

\[Q=DrN_{e}q_{e}N_{s}G\]

where:

D is the drift tube diameter (3 cm)

r is the expected rate (Hz/cm\({}^{2}\))

\(N_{e}\) is the average number of primary ionization electrons (\(\approx\)1500 for 5 atm)

\(q_{e}\) is the charge of an electron

\(N_{s}\) the number of seconds in a year (\(10^{7}\))

G is the "true" gas gain (assumed to be \(10^{5}\))

By "true gain" we mean the gain for an infinite charge collection time. For a typical 20 ns integration time, the charge seen by the preamplifier is about 10 times lower than the charge actually collected by the anode wire. This is known as the ballistic deficit due to the finite integration time of the front end electronics. There is some diversity of opinion as to what the true gain would be in the case of the MDTs. We believe that the assumed gain of \(10^{5}\) is correct to within a factor of two or so. Electronic noise and the optimum threshold are the determining factors.

Figure 2 shows the total charge per one centimeter of wire length for a year's operation as a function of pseudorapidity and for the three endcap superlayers. Again the solid lines are simply smooth curves connecting the data points.

## 4 Would a smaller diameter drift tube help?

For the mean occupancy the answer is definitely yes. The occupancy is reduced roughly with the square of the tube radius. Of course there is a linear increase in the number of electronic channels but this is the unavoidable price one pays for the reduction in the mean occupancy when everything else remains the same.

As for aging the answer is not as obvious. In principle the total charge per unit wire length is reduced proportionaly with the smaller radius. However reoptimization of the threshold to a smaller number of primary electrons will require a higher gas gain thus cancelling the advantage of a smaller radius. One may also add that the nominal \(10^{7}\) seconds per year may represent a conservative assumption when calculating potential yields for various physics processes but it may only be one third or one half the actual operating time.

## 5 Muon Coverage

The ATLAS baseline muon system provides muon measurements for \(|\eta|<2.8\), a coverage well matched to LHC physics. However, the baseline only provides a trigger for \(|\eta|<2\). For multimuon final states the loss in trigger acceptance is generally considerably less important than the loss in \(\eta\) coverage. Muons from a system with a mass less than several hundred GeV will generally have a rather flat distribution in \(\eta\). Thus, the probability that at least one of the \(n\) muons with \(|\eta|<2.8\) will have \(|\eta|<2.0\) is approximately

\[{\cal P}_{1\mu}\approx 1-\left(\frac{2.8-2.0}{2.8}\right)^{n}=1-(0.3)^{n}\,.\]

For a heavier system the events are more central, and the probability of seeing at least one muon is greater than this. Thus one can trigger with reasonable efficiency by relying on a single muon trigger. On the other hand, the probability that all the \(n\) muons are in the trigger acceptance is

\[{\cal P}_{n\mu}\approx\left(\frac{2.0}{2.8}\right)^{n}=(0.7)^{n}\,,\]

which becomes uncomfortably small for, say, \(n=4\). That is, by restricting the trigger coverage. one gives up the ability to apply more restrictive triggers and so unnecessarily sacrifices some trigger bandwidth. Also, having multiple redundant triggers allows one to determine the trigger efficiency directly from the data and so to reduce somewhat the systematic errors on the observed cross section. Without knowing what new physics might be discovered, it is hard to say whether these losses might be important or not.

Figure 3: Muon asymmetry in \(W^{\prime}\) production.

There are at least two classes of events, single muon signatures such as \(W^{\prime}\to\mu\nu\), and low-\(p_{T}\) muons such as those from \(B\) physics, for which the gain from increased muon trigger coverage may be greater than for generic \(n\)-muon signals.

For \(W^{\prime}\to\mu\nu\) the single muon provides the only trigger. Hence, for light masses one gains linearly with the \(\eta\) coverage, but the cross sections are then so large that this is not essential for discovering the particle. A consideration more sensitive to the \(\eta\) coverage is the ability to determine the \(W^{\prime}\) couplings by measuring the difference in the \(\eta\) distributions for \(W^{\prime+}\to\mu^{+}\nu\) and \(W^{\prime-}\to\mu^{-}\bar{\nu}\). A \(V-A\) coupling to both quarks and leptons will give a flatter distribution for the \(\mu^{-}\) and a more central distribution for the \(\mu^{+}\). For a 500 GeV \(W^{\prime}\), about the limit for observation at Fermilab, the two distributions are clearly different if one covers \(|\eta|<2.8\) but not well distinguished if one covers only \(|\eta|<2.0\), as is illustrated in Figure 3.

For a 1 TeV mass, coverage to \(|\eta|<2.0\) is sufficient to see the difference, but coverage to \(|\eta|<2.8\) is still significantly better. More generally, greater \(\eta\) coverage for the muon trigger gives a better ability to determine the \(\eta\) dependence of any new single-muon signal.

Muons with very low \(p_{T}\) lose so much energy in the calorimeter that they are hard to measure in the central region. This is illustrated in Figure 4, which shows the \(\eta\) distribution for single muons with \(E_{\mu}>6\) GeV from \(B\) decays. The distribution peaks strongly in the region not covered by the baseline trigger. Of course the single muon rate is so large that it would saturate the trigger bandwidth, but one can imagine triggering on several low-\(p_{T}\) muons, for example to select \(B^{0}\to vK_{s}\) with \(\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) plus a \(\mu\) tag for the other \(B\). With such a trigger the low-\(p_{T}\) muons at large \(|\eta|\) will be much easier to measure in the external spectrometer than those in the central region.

Finally, the ability to trigger on muons at all \(\eta\) would facilitate collection of data samples to be used to study the alignment and resolution of the entire muon system. While it should be possible to use \(Z^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events to do this, using single muons in the region of interest is clearly more convenient.

Another intriguing possibility of unique physics with a forward muon system is the potential for observing quark-gluon plasma in ultra relativistic heavy ion collisions that will be available at the LHC. One potentially powerfull signature of quark-gluon plasma formation is considered to be the suppression of \({\rm J}/\Psi\) and \(\Upsilon\) production due to color screening. It is important to observe the relative production of the excited states of these quarkonia since screening would be different because of the different effective radii distinguishing this signature from other possible effects resulting in production suppression. Access to muons with the lowest \({\rm P}_{T}\) is clearly necessary for this physics and can only be done in a very forward system. It should be noted that ALICE, the dedicated Heavy Ion experiment at the LHC can not, in the present design, probe this important topic. Further studies are, of course, required to quantitatively investigate this possibility in ATLAS and work has already started in that direction.

Perhaps none of the points discussed in this section is by itself a sufficient basis for extending the trigger to the full eta coverage, but all of them argue that such a system will produce better physics. There is no physics argument for reducing the trigger acceptance.
