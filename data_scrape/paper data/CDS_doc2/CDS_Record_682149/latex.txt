**Abstract**

We discuss the radiation of hard photons in the \(t\bar{t}\)_production_ and _decay_ as a background for the intermediate Higgs search at LHC/SSC experiments. For the purpose of experimental simulation of this process we propose to use the approximate Monte Carlo algorithm together with any physics Monte Carlo not including QED corrections. We verify, by comparison with the exact matrix element Monte Carlo TOPKI, that this method can be used to generate single- and double-photon bremsstrahlung in the \(t\bar{t}\) production process with a precision of 10% for experimental cuts. The predictions for the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background from photons radiated in the _production_ of \(t\bar{t}\) pair and their cascade _decays_, within simplified experimental cuts, are presented for the first time. We show that, even after additional cuts on the minimal lepton-photon mass, photons radiated in the production _and_ decay of a \(t\bar{t}\) pair increase this background by a factor of 2 with respect to previous estimates from radiation in the \(t\bar{t}\) production alone.

Introduction

One of the main physics goals of LHC and SSC experiments is the discovery of the Higgs boson. The present search strategies for the Higgs boson face a serious background problem in the mass region of the so-called intermediate Higgs, i.e. 80 GeV \(<M_{H}<\) 130 GeV. The dominant decay channel into a pair of heavy quarks has overwhelming QCD two-jet background in this region. The rare decay mode \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) with a branching ratio of \(\sim 2\times 10^{-3}\) is seriously considered as a potential signal for intermediate Higgs production [10]. The proposed signatures are well isolated \(\gamma\gamma\) or \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) events [11].

These signatures suffer from the very large background coming from different processes where photons can be radiated in the particle _production_ and/or _decay_. The photons contributing to a \(\gamma\gamma\) pair can be produced in many subprocesses of a proton-proton collision, e.g. \(q\bar{q}\to\gamma\gamma\), \(Z_{0}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}(\gamma)(\gamma)\), \(gg\to t\bar{t}(\gamma)(\gamma)\), \(t\to Wb(\gamma)\), \(W\to e\nu(\gamma)\), \(B\to D\nu(\gamma)\). The two photons in a pair can come from the same subprocess, _or_ from different ones. Moreover, to this background contribute events with photons faked by jets, \(\pi^{0}\) or electrons.

Exact calculations of single- and/or double-photon bremsstrahlung corrections for these subprocesses would be complicated, but not impossible. Such exact calculations for several subprocesses, e.g. \(gg\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\), \(gg\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\)[12, 13] or \(B\to De\nu\gamma\)[14], \(W\to\ell\nu\gamma\)[15] have been performed. In particular, those of the background for the Higgs search from \(gg\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) and \(gg\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) subprocesses have been performed in [16, 17].

However, the complete analysis of the \(\gamma\gamma\) background requires simultaneous control of photons radiated from the different sources in the same event. This requires complex theoretical calculations. This huge project is probably not necessary, because the precision required of the theoretical predictions is not very high. Analytical calculations alone will anyway give only a lower limit on the expected background. The full calculations can be performed by the complete physics Monte Carlo where detector effects can be included as well.

We would like to propose and present the following strategy for including QED backgrounds in the physics simulation with well _controlled_ precision:

* The simulation of the \(\gamma\gamma\) background is performed with a approximate Monte Carlo, which can implement QED bremsstrahlung for any subprocess and can be combined with any physics generator not including QED effects.
* The precision of this approximate approach is verified for each particular subprocess by comparison with an exact calculation also embodied in the form of a dedicated Monte Carlo.
* If the required precision for a particular subprocess becomes very high, the approximate simulation for this subprocess is replaced by the exact one in the full physics Monte Carlo.

In this paper we would like to realize part of this strategy. We discuss and test the PHOTOS package [1] as an approximate Monte Carlo for generating, up to \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\), two hard-photon QED corrections to the \(t\bar{t}\) production in \(pp\) collisions. Then, as an example, we use this package to simulate \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background for the Higgs search coming from the photons radiated in the \(t\bar{t}\) production and in one of the cascade decay channels, \(W\to\ell\nu\).

The \(t\bar{t}\) pair production in proton-proton collisions is dominated at LHC energies by the gluon-gluon scattering. The heavy top-quarks decay semi-weakly into bottom quarks plus \(W\) bosons [2]. The possible sources of photons are the top quarks, the \(W\)'s, their decay products, and finally any charged particle that appears in the cascade after parton shower and hadronization. One does not expect photons emitted very late in the cascade to have enough energy and transverse momentum to contribute to the Higgs background significantly. However, at least photons emitted from the top quarks and from the leptons in the semileptonic decays of \(W\)'s should be considered simultaneously. Therefore, we generate QED bremsstrahlung (up to two photons) in the hard process of the gluon-gluon scattering \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) and simultaneously generate photons in the semileptonic \(W\) decays. In the \(\gamma\gamma\) pair, both photons can be emitted from the top quarks or from the \(W\) decays, or one photon can be emitted from a top quark while the other one comes from a \(W\) decay.

The generation of the events, i.e. \(t\bar{t}\) production, their decay into \(W\) and \(b\), and the creation of the cascade, we perform with a Monte Carlo, PYTHIA56 [3]. A good candidate for an approximate Monte Carlo that generates hard photons in all subprocesses of the event is the package PHOTOS. This package generates QED single-photon bremsstrahlung in decays of particles and is universal in the sense that it allows for easy interface with "any" program generating decays of "any" particle.

However, the application of this package to the generation of bremsstrahlung photons (up to two photons) in the \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) subprocess requires additional modifications and verification of the precision of the results. This verification can be performed by comparison with exact calculations. For this purpose we construct an exact matrix element Monte Carlo TOPKI, which simulates the following subprocesses: \(pp\to t\bar{t}X\), \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma X\) and \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma X\). This program is based on our own, independent, exact matrix element calculations and provides full kinematics of outgoing particles.

The outline of this paper is as follows. In section 2 we describe the exact Monte Carlo generator TOPKI, which simulates \(pp\to t\bar{t}(\gamma)(\gamma)X\) processes. Section 3 is devoted to a discussion of the applicability of the PHOTOS package for simulation of the single- and double-photon bremsstrahlung in the \(pp\to t\bar{t}X\) process. In section 4 we compare numerical results from this package and the exact matrix element Monte Carlo, to discuss its precision. In section 5, for simplified experimental cuts, we simulate the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background coming from photons radiated in the production \(and/or\) decay of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs for simplified experimental cuts. Conclusions are presented in section 6. All the technical details are collected in Appendices. Exact matrix element calculations and the corresponding Monte Carlo TOPKI algorithm are de scribed in Appendix A. The details of the modifications of the approximate package are described in Appendix B.

## 2 Dedicated Monte Carlo TOPKI for the exact matrix element simulation of processes

\(pp\to t\bar{t}X\), \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma X\), \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma X\)

In this section we would like to describe a Monte Carlo dedicated to the simulation of the \(pp\to t\bar{t}(\gamma)(\gamma)X\) processes.

The process of \(t\bar{t}\) pair production in \(pp\) scattering is described in standard QCD through annihilation of a quark-antiquark pair (\(s\)-channel reaction), gluon-gluon scattering (\(s\)-, \(t\)-, \(u\)-channel reactions) or \(W\)-gluon fusion. The gluon-gluon scattering is the dominant mechanism at LHC energies for the \(t\bar{t}\) production for top-quark masses upto \(\sim 250\) GeV [10] and we limit ourselves to this channel. As regards Feynman diagrams, we consider only the lowest-order QCD diagrams for the hard process and leading-log structure functions, but with up to \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) two hard-photon QED corrections. The virtual QED corrections are not included in this program.

The algorithm of the generator consists of a few separate segments:

* Generation of the parton energy fractions.
* Generation of the phase-space configuration for the desired option (0, 1, 2 photons).
* Structure function calculation.
* Exact matrix element calculation for the desired option (0, 1, 2 photons).
* Calculation of the final event weight.

Let us briefly describe each of the segments listed above. We start with the generation of the energy fractions \(x_{1},x_{2}\) carried by the scattering gluons. We generate these variables according to the crude distribution \(1/x_{1}^{2}x_{2}^{2}\) in the allowed kinematical region, i.e. for parton-parton energies greater than two top-quark masses.

For the known energy of the interacting gluon-gluon pair we generate 2, 3 or 4 particles phase space, depending on which option of the program is executed. We generate complete phase-space, including all mass effects, with presampling for photon energy singularity. The photon is generated with an energy greater than the small fraction \(\epsilon\) of the total available hard-process energy. The phase-space is generated in the parton-parton rest frame and then all four momenta are boosted into the laboratory frame. This boost can change the photon energies significantly, so that the infrared parameter \(\epsilon\) should be set sufficiently small, depending on the region of interest of photon energies in the laboratory frame. The details concerning this phase-space generator are described in Appendix A.

After generation of the phase-space, a pre-trigger is applied: if the event is not accepted, lengthy matrix element and density function calculations are omitted. For accepted events, the gluons structure functions are calculated. The structure functions, QCD coupling constant and energy scale for QCD evolution are parametrized as in the default version of PYTHIA56 [10]. For the QED coupling constant the low-energy value \(\alpha_{e}=1/137\) is used.

The crucial parts of the program are the exact matrix element formulae for the \(gg\to t\overline{t}\), \(gg\to t\overline{t}\gamma\) and \(gg\to t\overline{t}\gamma\gamma\) processes. The exact analytical formula for the \(gg\to t\overline{t}\) process is available in several papers [11]. For the \(gg\to t\overline{t}\gamma\) and \(gg\to t\overline{t}\gamma\gamma\) processes we use formulae coded in a form convenient for numerical calculations. We use our own code, based on the spinor product formalism developed by the CALCUL collaboration [12]. The technical details concerning this code are described in Appendix A. Contrary to the other realization of the CALCUL method, our realization does not require an algebraic manipulation.

The exact matrix element formulae for the \(gg\to t\overline{t}\gamma\gamma\) and \(gg\to b\overline{b}\gamma\) processes have been coded before [13, 14]. However we have coded them independently and accordingly to a completely different scheme. We have checked the results from our code, and from formulae included in unpublished programs by Kunzat et al. [15]. We have found an agreement better than \(2\times 10^{-5}\). We have also checked the agreement separately for the phase-space generation and energy-fraction generation. After consistently parametrizing structure functions and coupling constants, we have found agreement on the cross-section from our generator and the programs from ref. [16] at the level of a few per cent (statistical error). For the two-photon option our generator is slower by a factor of 2 than the generator from [17] in calculating the cross-section with the same statistical error. We have noticed that the difference in definition of the evolution energy scale \(Q^{2}\) between ref. [18] and PYTHIA56 leads to differences at the level of 40% for the cross-section.

For the time being, this program TOPKI can be executed only for one chosen option (0, 1 or 2 photons in the final state) at a time. So far, it produces weighted events only.

PHOTOS as an approximate Monte Carlo for generating single and double bremsstrahlung in the \(pp\to t\bar{t}X\) process

The Monte Carlo package PHOTOS [19] implements an algorithm of QED single-photon radiative corrections in decays. This program is universal, i.e. it generates, with a certain approximation, single-photon bremsstrahlung in the decay of "any" resonance. It is based on the leading-log approximation for the bremsstrahlung matrix element, but conserves also a proper soft-photon behaviour. It provides the four momenta of particles in the final state, including mass effects.

Let us recall here briefly the basic principle of the algorithm. The process-independent approximate formula for QED final bremsstrahlung is constructed in the framework of the leading-log technique [10] and of the factorization property [11] of the bremsstrahlung kernel, which have been used successfully for many purposes [12]. This factorization property leads to a formula that can be written approximately as:

\[d\sigma^{radiative}=d\sigma^{Born}\rho_{\gamma}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)dkd\cos \theta\frac{d\phi}{2\pi}, \tag{1}\]

where \(k\) denotes the photon energy normalized to the available energy \(E=1/2\sqrt{s}\), \(s\) being the square of the process energy; \((\theta,\phi)\) define the photon direction with respect to the emitting fermion. This factorization property extends in some cases also to the exact \({\cal O}(\alpha)\) calculations [10]. More details on the function \(\rho_{\gamma}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) are given in Appendix B.

The package has been tested by comparison with exact calculations for the decay channel \(Z_{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\gamma\)[10], and for the decay channels \(\tau^{\pm}\to e^{\pm}\bar{\nu}_{e}\nu_{\tau}\gamma\)[11, 12], \(B^{\pm}\to D^{0}e^{\pm}\bar{\nu}_{e}\gamma\)[10] and \(W\to\ell\nu\gamma\)[10]. For these, it works remarkably well, reproducing QED effects with a precision better than 10%.

The simulation of single bremsstrahlung by this package in the subprocess \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) is far beyond straightforward applicability for two reasons. First, because the ratio of the top-quark mass to the available energy can be of the order of one, which makes leading-log terms comparable with subleading ones. Second, because the dominant channel of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair production, i.e. gluon-gluon scattering, is not the decay of a resonance. There is also the question of whether this package can be used to simulate properly double-photon bremsstrahlung. Such a simulation, consistent with leading-log \({\cal O}(\alpha^{2})\) approximation, can be performed by executing the leading-log \({\cal O}(\alpha)\) algorithm twice1. We must however include an additional weight \(1/2\) for each single/double-photon event. For the single-photon configurations, this is because we generate twice as many single-photon configurations as in the leading-log \({\cal O}(\alpha)\) case. For double-photon configurations, this is because of the statistical factor \((1/2!)\) for two identical particles (photons) in the final state.

Footnote 1: This method does not apply for calculating the total cross-section, because virtual corrections in the 0- and 1-photon configurations are not reproduced correctly in such a simulation.

All these questions relating to the applicability of the described package to generate single- and double-photon bremsstrahlung in the \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) process will be, in the next section, checked numerically by comparison with exact calculations. Some modifications of the package are necessary for the purpose of such simulations anyway.

These modifications are mainly connected with the definition of the photon density function. The density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{PHOTOS}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\), used originally in the algorithm of the PHOTOS package [10], is based on the leading-log approximation. In the \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) process there are two charged particles in the final state, so that the significant effect of interference between emission from \(t\) and \(\bar{t}\) lines has to be included. This inclusion of the interference term leads to a modification in the definition of the density function; this modified function will later be called \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\). We also consider a less universal definition of the density function, \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\), where in addition to including interference terms we include also mass terms taken from calculation for pure \(s\)-channel process. This density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) reproduces the exact \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha)\) photon spectrum in the case of the \(s\)-channel process \(Z_{0}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\gamma\)[2]. These two definitions of density functions (explicit formulae are given in Appendix B) are consistent with the leading-log approximation and differ only by subleading mass terms. The verification of which one is a better approximation of this particular \(gg\to t\bar{t}\gamma\) process can be answered only by comparison2 with exact calculations.

Footnote 2: For the time being we include the modifications of the photon density function as an event weight outside the original PHOTOS package.

Let us notice that, for the time being, single/double hard-photon simulation with this package requires a special treatment of the events. The single-photon algorithm has to be applied twice for each event, but the second time the algorithm is executed on the modified event. If a first photon is generated then the kinematics for the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) event is balanced and the second execution of the package simulates the second photon as a single-photon radiation in the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) event. In this way kinematical constraints are fulfilled without any approximation. The question of the infrared photon cut-off is not completely trivial in such an algorithm. The emission of the second photon changes the kinematics (boosts) of the first one, and this transformation may decrease or increase energy of the first photon, depending on its orientation in phase-space. One should also remember that even for single-photon emission, boosting from the parton-parton rest frame, where the photons are emitted, into the laboratory frame may change photon energies significantly. Therefore, to avoid this problem, the value of \(k_{0}\) used for generation should be set sufficiently smaller than the desired photon energy range. For the physics simulation this problem does not show up if the desired region includes only high-transverse-momentum photons.

Let us make a general remark concerning the application of this package to the PYTHIA physics generator. Usually this package could be applied after the full event has been generated by PYTHIA. However, if photons are to be radiated in the processes where the outgoing particles form strings and hadronize (e.g. \(gg\to t\bar{t}\), \(t\to Wb\) ), the package should be applied before the parton shower and hadronization are generated by PYTHIA.

Comparison of the exact and approximate simulations for the \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma X\) and \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma X\) processes

In this section we present the comparison between the exact and approximate simulations for the \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma X\) and \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma X\) processes. The aim of this comparison is to verify the precision of the approximate simulation. We are interested in obtaining not only a reasonable precision in reproducing the exact cross-section, but also good agreement for several distributions that are experimentally of interest.

To perform the approximate simulation we generate \(pp\to t\bar{t}X\) events with the TOPKI. They are then treated by PHOTOS to generate single/double hard-photon corrections to this process. The results of this simulation are compared with the exact simulation of \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma X\), \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma X\) events by the corresponding options of TOPKI.

We will examine several distributions that are interesting for experimental analysis, such as transverse momentum and pseudorapidity distributions of photon and top quark, hard-process energy distribution, photon energy spectrum, and finally, in the case of two photons, photon-pair mass distribution. For moderate experimental cuts and photon density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}\), the obtained agreement on these distributions, at the level of 10%, seems to be sufficient for the requirements of the background estimation. The density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) underestimates the cross-section by 20% if cuts are applied and is therefore not recommended for simulation of this particular process. Nevertheless as another legitimate choice of the photon density function helps to better control systematic errors of the method. However it is necessary to verify the precision of the approximate simulation again, if the chosen experimental cuts become very strong, leaving only a region very close to phase-space boundaries.

### Single-photon bremsstrahlung: \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma X\) process

In Figs. 1a and 1b we present comparisons of the basic theoretical distributions: the photon energy spectrum multiplied by the photon energy (\(kd\sigma/dk\)), and the photon angular distribution with respect to the top quark (\(d\sigma/dcos\theta_{\pi}\)) for the hard \(gg\to t\bar{t}\gamma\) subprocess in the gluon-gluon rest frame of fixed energy \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}=400\) GeV and for \(m_{t}=140\) GeV. The distributions generated by the approximate package according to the density functions \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) (thick line) and \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) (thin line) are compared with those generated by the exact Monte Carlo (full circles). The distributions \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\), \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\), integrated over the \(\theta\), \(\phi\) dependence and multiplied by the Born cross-section, are drawn in Fig. 1a (small dots) as well. The photon spectra (Fig. 1a) agree, as they should, in the soft-photon region, whereas their behaviour in the very-hard-photon region is different. We have checked that the difference disappears when \(4m_{t}^{2}/\hat{s}\to 0\). However it must be noticed that the very-hard-photon region does not contribute significantly to the hard cross-section if the cuts applied on the photon energy are not very strong. In the medium-\(k\) region the distribution \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) agrees better with the exact calculations. In Fig. 1b we show the photon angular distribution (\(d\sigma/d\cos\theta_{\gamma}\)). The agreement between the exact and approximate calculations is very good. The slightly larger values of the \(d\sigma/d\cos\theta_{\gamma}\) distribution in the region \(\cos\theta_{\gamma}\sim-1\), as obtained from the \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) density function, is the consequence of the larger number of very hard photons (a very hard photon has to be opposite to the \(t\bar{t}\) pair). The integrated hard cross-sections differ only by about 5% (see Table 1).

The full proton-proton process means not only a variable energy for the hard process and convolution with structure functions, but also boosts of all momenta into the laboratory frame. The emitted soft/hard photon in the gluon-gluon frame may not be so in the laboratory frame, and these kinematical effects will be mixed in the final distributions. The distributions for the \(pp\to t\bar{\gamma}X\) process in the proton-proton rest frame (laboratory frame) are presented in Figs. 2a-2g. In Figs. 2a and 2b we present comparisons of the photon energy spectrum multiplied by the photon energy (\(E^{\gamma}d\sigma/dE^{\gamma}\)) and photon angular distributions (\(d\sigma/dcos\theta_{\gamma t}\)). The photon energy spectrum (Fig. 2a) is better reproduced by the simulation with density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}\) in the presented energy range. The disagreement in the hard part of the spectrum (Fig. 1a) is overspread by boosts and nearly invisible in the (\(d\sigma/d\cos\theta_{\gamma t}\)) distribution (Fig. 2b). In Fig. 2c we present the hard process energy distribution \(d\sigma/d\sqrt{\hat{s}}\), where \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}\) is the energy of the gluon-gluon pair. The exact distribution is better reproduced by the simulation with the \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}\) density function, except in the region just above the threshold of the \(t\bar{t}\) production. The same observation holds for the distribution \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{t}\) of the top transverse momentum with respect to the beam axis \(z\) (Fig. 2d). Figure 2e shows the top-quark pseudorapidity \(d\sigma/d\eta^{t}\) distribution,

The simulation with the \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) density function slightly overestimates the cross-section and that with \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) slightly underestimates it. We expect (see Fig. 1a) that this tendency will show up more strongly after applying cuts on photon energy. One should be aware that this cross-section, without any cuts, comes mostly from the soft-photon emission in the gluon-gluon frame (small-\(k\) region in Fig. 1a). Increasing the required photon transverse momentum (the transverse momentum is the observable that does not change due to the boost from the hard-process frame into the laboratory frame), we push the region of accepted photons into the direction of middle-\(k\) (see Fig. 1a), where the discrepancies between the exact calculations and the approximate density functions \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}\) start to be visible. On the other hand, increasing the required quark transverse momentum we increase also the minimal hard-process energy \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}_{min}\) and therefore decrease the value of \(k\) for a fixed photon energy; we also reduce the mass terms \(\sim m_{t}^{2}/\hat{s}\) contributions. These two effects are shown in Tables 3 and 4. A moderate experimental cut such as \(p_{T}^{\gamma}>25\) GeV decreases the agreement between exact and approximate calculations but a simultaneous cut on the top-quark transverse momenta \(p_{T}^{t}>25\) GeV improves the agreement again. The simulation with the photon density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) agrees with the exact calculations at the level of 10%, even after moderate cuts are applied. The exact and approximate cross-sections differ by only a few per cent. The simulation with the density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}\) significantly (by 20%) underestimates the hard cross-section.

### Double-photon bremsstrahlung: \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma X\) process

As in the single-photon case, we start this comparison by checking the results of exact and approximate simulation in the gluon-gluon rest frame. In Figs. 3a and 3b we present comparisons of the photon energy spectra (single-photon spectrum integrated over the second one) multiplied by the photon energy (\(kd\sigma/dk\)) and the angular distributions (\(d\sigma/d\cos\theta_{\gamma t}\)) for the hard \(gg\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) process in the gluon-gluon rest frame with fixed energy \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}=400\) GeV. The distributions generated with the density functions \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) (thick line) and \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) (thin line) are compared with those generated by the exact Monte Carlo (full circles). The photon energy spectra (Fig. 3a) are shifted a little in the soft-photon region, which is the effect of slightly different values of the integrated single-photon spectra andalso the residual effect of the kinematical shifts on the infrared cut-off in the case of double-photon configuration. In the medium- and large-\(k\) region, a simulation with the density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}\) significantly overestimates this distribution, whereas one with \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}\) is in good agreement with the exact calculations. The photon angular distributions with respect to the top-quark axis (\(\,d\sigma/d\cos\theta_{\gamma t}\)) are compared in Fig. 3b. The overestimation of the distribution in the case of simulation with the density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}\) is visible in the whole range of \(\theta_{\gamma t}\). The integrated hard cross-sections are collected in Table 1, above. Simulation with \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) overestimates this hard cross-section by 20%, the agreement for \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) is better than a few per cent.

The distributions for the full \(pp\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma X\) process in the proton-proton rest frame (laboratory frame) are presented in Figs. 4a-4h. As in the single photon case several kinematical effects are spread over. In Figs. 4a and 4b, we present comparisons of the photon energy spectra, multiplied by the photon energy (\(E^{\gamma}d\sigma/dE^{\gamma}\)) and angular distributions (\(d\sigma/d\cos\theta_{\gamma t}\)) in the proton-proton rest frame. In Fig. 4c we present the hard-process energy distribution, i.e. the energy of the gluon-gluon pair. Figure 4d shows the top-quark transverse momentum distribution \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{\gamma}\) and Fig. 4e its pseudorapidity \(d\sigma/d\eta^{t}\) distribution. Similar distributions for photons \(d\sigma/dp_{T}^{\gamma}\) and \(d\sigma/d\eta^{\gamma}\) are shown in Figs. 4f and 4g. Finally, in Fig. 4h the distribution of the mass of the photon-photon pair \(d\sigma/dM^{\gamma\gamma}\) is presented. The exact and approximate distributions agree at the level of 10%. As in the single-photon case a simulation with \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) density function overestimates the cross-section by 10% and one with \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}(k,\cos\theta,\phi)\) slightly underestimates it if no additional cuts are applied. The hard cross-sections are also collected in Table 2.

However we expect that the application of the experimental cuts will have the same effects as in the single-photon case. The obtained hard cross-sections have been collected in Tables 3 and 4. The agreement on the hard cross-section is better than a few per cent in the case of the \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}\) density function and is at the level of 10% for the distributions. Simulations with the photon density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{B}\) has the tendency to significantly underestimate the cross-section (15%) after some cuts are applied, and is not recommended for this particular process.

## 5 The \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) events from the \(t\bar{t}\) production _and_ decay

The background of \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) events coming from two-hard-photons radiation in the \(t\bar{t}\) production alone (i.e. from \(gg\to t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) process) has already been calculated [10, 11] and we have reproduced the results from these articles.

However, the photons coming from the decay of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs have never before, to our knowledge, been considered simultaneously in published articles. For this simulation, as physics Monte Carlo we use PYTHIA 56 with switched on hard subprocesses \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) and \(qq\to t\bar{t}\), and default version of structure functions, evolution energy scale, and coupling constants [10]. The top quark decays into \(W\) and \(b\) quark. The \(W\)'s decay non-leptonically or semileptonically into \(\ell\nu\) pairs. After these decays the cascade creation is stopped. The package PHOTOS with the density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}\) is used to generate up to two hard photons in the \(t\overline{t}\) production process (\(\gamma_{prod}\)). The default version of the density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{PHOTOS}\) is used for the simulation of the single bremsstrahlung in the semileptonic \(W\to\ell\nu\) decay (\(\gamma_{dec}\)). The lepton in the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) event comes from the semileptonic decay of \(W\)'s. The pair of photons in the event can be of three different types \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{prod}\), \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{dec}\), and \(\gamma_{dec}\gamma_{dec}\).

We trigger events using simplified cuts. We require that one of the accepted photons and the lepton have transverse momenta (with respect to the beam axis) greater then 25 GeV and another photon has transverse momentum greater than 40 GeV. We also require their pseudorapidity to be in the range \(-2.5<\eta^{\gamma,l}<2.5\). We accept the event if at least one lepton and exactly two photons pass the trigger (for simplicity we omit very rare events with three or four accepted photons).

\begin{tabular}{||l||l||l|l|l||} \hline Cuts & \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{prod}\ell\) [fb] & \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{dec}\ell\) [fb] & \(\gamma_{dec}\gamma_{dec}\ell\) [fb] \\ \hline \(P_{T^{\prime}}^{\gamma,l}>\)25 GeV & & & & \\ \(P_{T^{\prime}max}^{\gamma}>\)40 GeV & 3.471 \(\pm\) 0.033 & 24.058 \(\pm\) 0.044 & 20.040 \(\pm\) 0.009 \\ \(\eta^{\gamma,l}<\) 2.5 & & & & \\ \hline \(P_{T}^{\gamma,l}>\) 25 GeV & & & & \\ \(P_{T^{\prime}max}^{\gamma}>\) 40 GeV & & & & \\ \(\eta^{\gamma,l}<\) 2.5 & 3.237 \(\pm\) 0.042 & 3.924 \(\pm\) 0.088 & 0.582 \(\pm\) 0.039 \\ \(M_{min}^{\gamma\ell}>\) 25 GeV & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Table 5:**_The cross-section for the signature \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) in the pp \(\to t\overline{t}X(\gamma)(\gamma)\) process with \(t\to Wb\) and semileptonic \(W\to\ell\nu(\gamma)\) or non-leptonic decay of \(W\). The pp \(\to t\)TX process is generated by the default version of PYTHIA 56. Approximate package PHOTOS with the density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{A}\) is used to generate single/double bremsstrahlung in \(t\overline{t}\) production and with the default density function \(\rho_{\gamma}^{PHOTOS}\) to generate single photon bremsstrahlung in semileptonic \(W\) decay. The pairs of photons in the events denoted as \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{prod}\) are radiated in the \(t\overline{t}\) production process. In the case of \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{dec}\ell\) events one photon is radiated from the \(t\overline{t}\) production process and one from the \(W\) semileptonic decay, whereas in the events denoted as \(\gamma_{dec}\gamma_{dec}\ell\) both photons originate from the \(W\) semileptonic decays. The leptons come from the semileptonic \(W\to\ell\nu\) decay (each event contains at least one lepton within defined cuts). The proton-proton rest frame energy is \(\sqrt{s}=16000\) GeV, \(m_{t}=140\) GeV and \(\alpha_{e}=1/137\)._

The obtained results are presented in Table 5. The background from \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{dec}\ell\) and \(\gamma_{dec}\gamma_{dec}\ell\) events is larger by a factor of 10 than that from \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{prod}\ell\) events alone,for the \(\gamma\gamma\) pair mass 70 GeV\(<M^{\gamma\gamma}<\)140 GeV (see Fig. 5a). This background can be significantly reduced by applying an additional cut on the minimal lepton-photon mass \(M^{\gamma\ell}_{min}\) as proposed in [7]. The \(M^{\gamma\ell}_{min}\) distribution is shown in Fig. 5b. We have chosen a cut, \(M^{\gamma\ell}_{min}>25\)GeV, which significantly reduces the background from the \(\gamma_{dec}\gamma_{dec}\ell\) and \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{dec}\ell\) events. Even after this cut (see Fig. 5b), the background from \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{dec}\ell\) events is still comparable with that from the \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{prod}\ell\) events. Thus the background is higher by a factor of 2 than was estimated from \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{prod}\ell\) events alone (Fig. 5c). From Fig. 5b it is obvious that the contribution from \(\gamma_{prod}\gamma_{dec}\ell\) events cannot be reduced much, by further increasing the cut on \(M^{\gamma\ell}_{min}\).

## 6 Summary

In this paper we have presented a strategy for including QED bremsstrahlung in the \(t\bar{t}\) production and decays.

As utility Monte Carlo to generate QED radiative corrections in the \(t\bar{t}\) pair production and decay, we proposed to use the approximate package PHOTOS combined with a basic physics Monte Carlo such as PYTHIA 56. The application of PHOTOS in the case of the \(t\bar{t}\) production process is non-standard and far beyond the purpose of its original description, so it has required a few modifications3. To verify the accuracy of this solution, we have constructed an exact matrix element Monte Carlo, TOPKI, which simulates \(pp\to t\bar{t}(\gamma)(\gamma)X\) processes. We have checked that this approximate package reproduces the relevant experimental distributions with a precision of 10% for moderate experimental cuts.

Footnote 3: The new version of PHOTOS 2.0 will include these modifications [7].

We have performed a very simple analysis of the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background for the intermediate Higgs search using the proposed approximate package PHOTOS and the physics generator PYTHIA. For the first time, photon radiation in the \(t\bar{t}\) production and decay have been generated simultaneously. These photons contribute to the background for the Higgs search larger by a factor of 10 than photons emitted in the \(t\bar{t}\) production alone. Even after additional cuts, the background from photons radiated in \(t\bar{t}\) production and decay is on the level of the background from photons radiated only in the production, and therefore increases the background from the top events by a factor of 2 with respect to previous estimates. An additional source of photons from the subprocess \(t\to Wb(\gamma)\) was not discussed here. We have estimated with PHOTOS that it effectively increases the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background by the additional factor of 1.2 and 1.1, respectively, according to the case when an \(M^{\gamma\ell}_{min}\) cut is and is not included.
