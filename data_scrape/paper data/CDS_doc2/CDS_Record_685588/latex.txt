**Abstract:**

We have measured the characteristics of 3.8 m Menziken aluminum tubes from a batch that is to be used in the construction of the Common Prototype BOS ATLAS muon chamber. We find that the properties of these newly delivered tubes are comparable to those incorporated in the previous BMS Prototype chamber, which suggests that the Menziken manufacturing process is reliable and sufficiently stable for supplying tubes to ATLAS.

**Introduction and Procedure:**

Prior to constructing the BMS Prototype chamber in the Spring of 1996 [1], we measured the properties of 700 Menziken 2.2 m long tubes, to determine whether they were whithin the specified dimensional tolerances [2]. The most appropriate tubes were subsequently selected for matching to aluminum endplugs. This required that the endpugs fitted snuggly within the tubes, but that they did not widen them beyond their elastic limit in the process of their installation.

To check the reproducibility of the manufacturing process at Menziken, we measured the outer diameters of 100 newly produced 3.8 m tubes, intended for use in the upcoming construction of the Common Prototype BOS muon chamber. The tubes were placed as straight as possible in 90 V-blocks that were positioned at the ends of each tube. Additional support was provided in the middle of the tube. The V-block at which the measurements were taken, had a small steel ball-bearing embedded on either side of the V surface, and 15 mm from the center of the V point. A feeler gauge, giving deviations in \(\mu\)m, was placed on the side opposite to one of the steel balls to measure the tube diameter at that point of contact. A thin layer of grease was used to prevent the steel balls from scratching the tubes during the measuring process. Each tube was measured about 25 mm away from the end. Nine measurements were recorded at eight locations, spaced in about 45\({}^{o}\) azimuthal intervals (with the ninth repeating the first measured point). The ball bearings minimized surface contact between tube and V-block, and thereby provided a precise measure of the diameter of the tube. The measurements were calibrated using a 30.000 mm and a 30.020 mm diameter precision steel cylinder.

In addition, in order to check that the variation of the wall thickness for any single tube, as well as among the new tubes, was acceptable, we measured the thickness of walls in 24 tubes. This was done by suspending each tube between a V-block at one end, and a small cylinder with an imbedded steel ball-bearing at the other end. The measurement was performed using a feeler gauge located on the side of the wall opposite to the position of the supporting ball bearing. The thickness was measured at eight locations (roughly at 45\({}^{o}\) intervals), about 10 mm from the end of the tube. Both sides of the tubes were measured, but there was no attempt made to maintain an absolute orientation between the two sides. The first twelve tubes were measured relative to a calibration point established by the top of the ball bearing, and the second twelve relative to a 400 \(\mu\)m shim that was placed on top of the bearing. The latter calibration required less extrapolation, and was therefore thought to be more accurate.

**Results of the Studies**

To determine the reproducibility of the method we used for measuring tube diameters, we repeated and compared the measurements for 20 tubes. Figure 1 displays the results obtained for the difference between two equivalent measurements of mean tube diameters for Tubes 20-40. The results of a set of nine measurements were averaged, and that average value subtracted from an average of a second set of nine measurements that were taken about 1 mm further along the length of the tube. The mean values of the diameters for these two independent measurements of the tubes are also plotted in Fig. 1, in terms of a shortfall from the nominal value of 30.000 mm. The mean diameter for this sample is about 25\(\mu\)m below the nominal 30 mm, which corresponds to an about 5\(\mu\)m greater shortfall than was the case for the previous batch of tubes [2]. The reproducibility appears to be about 1.5\(\mu\)m per measurement, and the dispersion is more like 5\(\mu\)m. The means of the nine measurements for all 100 tubes are shown in Fig. 2, with the distribution of the means given in Fig. 3. The mean diameters were specified to lie in the range of 29.970 mm to 30.000 mm, and the asymmetry in Fig. 3 suggests that Menziken had to discard a substantial fraction of tubes that had diameters below 29.970 mm. We see again that the mean

diameter is approximately 25\(\mu\)m below 30 mm, and the dispersion in diameters is about 5\(\mu\)m.

The departure of a tube's circumference from circularity can be gauged from the dispersion of the nine measurements relative to the mean value of that tube's diameter. The distribution for these individual standard deviations is shown in Fig. 4, for all 100 tubes. The departure from circularity appears to be quite small, and within ATLAS specifications.

Now, turning to measurements of the wall thickness, we show in Fig. 5(a), in consecutive order, the eight measurements obtained at one end, followed by

the eight measurements at the other end, for each of the first 12 tubes. The analogous results for the next 12 tubes, using the somewhat better calibration procedure, are given in Fig. 5(b). The dispersion in thickness for all 24 tubes is consistent with 4\(\mu\)m (which is the error used in the figure to calculate the \(\chi^{2}\) for an assumed constant thickness). The mean values differ by 5\(\mu\)m, which we

attribute to the different calibration methods used in measuring the two samples. The mean absolute value of the wall thickness is \(402\mu\)m, as inferred from Tubes 13-24, which were measured using the more reliable calibration. We estimate an uncertainty of \(<2\mu\)m in the absolute value. (The thickness specification to Menziken was \(400\pm 5\mu\)m.)

The difference in the mean of the two sets of eight measurements for each of the 24 tubes is shown in Fig. 6(a), and the dispersion for all 16 thickness measurements about the mean value for each tube is given in Fig. 6(b). From Fig. 6(a), we can deduce that the variation in mean thickness of the tubes is well within \(1\mu\)m (which was the value used in the calculation of the \(\chi^{2}\)). Finally, from Fig. 6(b), we infer that the thickness variation around the circumference of individual tubes is about \(1.5\mu\)m (again, the value used in the calculation of the \(\chi^{2}\) in the figure).

**Discussion and Conclusions:**

Measurements of the thickness and diameters of a new batch of Menziken tubes indicate that the production process at the firm is well in hand, and that ATLAS can rely on obtaining tubes that have acceptable roundness, and wall thickness and diameters that are within specifications.
