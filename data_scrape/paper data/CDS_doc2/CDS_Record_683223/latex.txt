## Foreword

A draft version of this report was distributed to the members of the ATLAS magnet panel on the 8 January 1993. Since then the project has evolved and involved more people at CERN, RAL & SACLAY. This has brought some modifications to the content of this report. The main changes can be listed as follows:

- _Surface building & crane requirements_

The dimensions and configuration of surface buildings have changed, as have their

crane requirements.

- _Experimental area layout_

The elliptical shaft has now been adopted as the preferred arrangement.

- _Installation procedure & Outline time schedule_

The PERT model has been updated to incorporate the following:

- RAL & SACLAY revised work schedules.

- Revised work sequences following discussions with the CERN civil engineers.

- Revised work sequences due to the elliptical shaft modifying the assembly

sequence once the barrel toroid has been assembled underground.

In addition, the ATLAS collaboration issued a report " Staging/Down-grading of

ATLAS " on the 19 March 1993. Staging has, therefore, not been explicitly addressed in

this report. However, as a general remark, the surface building requirements would be

less and the overall installation of the first phase of the detector would be somewhat shorter.

It is emphasized that this report represents the conceptual studies that have been

made. More detailed studies are in progress. It reflects our present understanding and

will clearly evolve once the actual configuration of the detector is known.

## Introduction

This report describes what conceptual studies have been made for the

Superconducting Air Core Toroid option of the ATLAS detector in relation to the

following:

- Surface building & crane requirements

- Experimental area layout

- Installation procedure

- Outline time schedule

- Cryogenic requirements

- Infrastructure requirements

The air core toroid consists of the barrel toroid (BACT) and the 2 end cap toroids

(EACT). This report is based on the 12 coil configurations.

In analysing the above it is clear that the magnet cannot be considered separately from

the rest of ATLAS. The experimental area layout and surface building requirements,together with the installation procedure, need to take into account all the ATLAS components ( the calorimeters, muon chambers, etc. ) to show what the infrastructure requirements would be (cranes, etc) and to determine how long the whole assembly process would take - surface and underground.

The installation sequence of the muon chambers and the inner detector is relatively independent of the particular detector technology chosen. However, this is not the case for the installation of the calorimeters. Here it is appropriate to study 2 scenarios; a full ( Em + Hadronic ) liquid argon calorimeter ( barrel = 2300t ) and a hybrid scenario with only an Em liquid argon calorimeter ( barrel < 330t )

The 2500 t crane mentioned in the LOI would only be necessary for the full ( Em + Hadronic ) liquid argon calorimeter. This calorimeter would need to be assembled into its 3 cryostats on the surface, an underground assembly would take too long.

## SURFACE BUILDING & CRANE REQUIREMENTS

Four main surface buildings are required for the experiment. Since at this stage of the project the actual site layout is still under discussion, we show a conceptual building arrangement - with realistic dimensions - in appendix 1. The four buildings are as follows:

**BACT assembly building**

A building, 93 x 28 x 16m high, is required for the testing and assembly of the coils.

Appendix 2 (i) shows a plan view of the surface building as proposed by Saclay together with a perspective view of the assembly sequence and crane systems *.

For the storage of the coil assemblies an external area, 67 x 28m, is also required.

Crane requirements = 2 x 63t overhead travelling crane.

**EACT assembly building**

A separate building, 75m x 28m x 16m high, is required for the complete assembly and testing of the EACT's. Appendix 2 (ii) shows the proposed arrangement by RAL.

Crane requirements = 1 x 63t overhead travelling crane.

This building would probably not be required if the EACT's were to be staged by three years.

**Calorimeter assembly building**

The site layouts show a building, 30x28x16m high, as being required for the surface assembly of the calorimeters. The dimensions of this building have not been studied in the context of this report.

Crane requirements = 1 x 63t overhead travelling crane.

**Shaft / Cavern cover**

A building, 60 x28x16m high, is required to cover the shaft and the experimental cavern. This building can only be built once the underground civil engineering activities are completed. Appendix 1 shows a plan view of the 2 phases involved with the surface buildings.

Crane requirements = same crane as used in the calorimeter building.

In addition to these four main surface buildings there are requirements for other buildings ( offices, access control, cryogenic plant, etc.). These buildings appear on site layouts but are not included in this report.

#### Crane systems

In addition to the above cranes, a gantry crane system is also required. This crane would be used in all the above buildings for the handling of large assemblies. Crane rails would be provided in the ground to allow for this 2 x 165t  crane system to be used.

For the full LAr Calorimeter scenario a fixed 2500t crane is also required.

For the underground cavern it is proposed that 2 x 5 t travelling cranes be used for the handling of the muon chambers.

\({}^{\ast}\) C. Camut and his colleagues of CERN MT division have studied the crane systems and the handling operations in much more detail. They are preparing a report on this subject for the Air core toroids.

## Experimental Area Layout

The current proposed layout of the experimental area is shown in Appendix 3 (i). The dimensions are as given in the LOI. However, the forward muon chambers are shown being fixed from a structure on the end walls. The exact configuration of the experimental area and the respective dimensions are likely to change once all parameters are known in more detail (Muon chamber layouts, Services distribution, Calorimeter design & Cryogenic requirements).

An elliptical shaft, centrally positioned above ATLAS and providing access from above at both ends, has been adopted in preference to the offset circular shaft. The actual shape of the ellipse would need to take into consideration the access requirements for the barrel calorimeter with the BACT in place.

Additional caverns are required to house the electronic counting rooms and the cryogenic plant.

Appendix 3 (ii) shows the arrangement of the experimental area for points 1 & 7. At point 1, the experimental cavern with its dimensions of 44m x 26m, as given in the LOI, fits. However, it should be noted that its dimensions could not be modified by much without interfering with the existing LEP structures.

For point 7 the cavern and shaft dimensions could be increased, if necessary, without interfering with the existing LEP structures.

## Installation Procedure

With the exception of the BACT all detector components would be completely assembled on the surface for the full LAr scenario, whilst for the hybrid calorimeter some underground assembly of the calorimeter modules would be required (see below).

### Surface pre-assembly

From the summary installation schedule, appendix 5, the surface assembly of the EACT's and Calorimeters could start 3 years after the approval of the project (T0). The surface tests and assembly of the BACT modules could start 4 years after T0.

The main activities on the surface are described below.

_The superconducting barrel air core toroid (BACT )_

Each coil would receive an electrical test at the place of manufacture. Then, upon arrival at CERN, they would be pumped and cooled down for cryo tests. The cryogenic installation, which could be housed in a separate building common to all cryogenic plant, would need to be installed and operational prior to the delivery of the coils.

The BACT, due to its large dimensions - 20m diameter x 26m long - does not lend itself to being completely assembled on the surface. Instead, it is proposed to assemble the 12 separate superconducting coils into 4 modules consisting of a top and bottom module of 4 coils and 2 side modules with 2 coils and the support beam. These modules would each incorporate the cold and warm ties and would be less than 7m high. The largest module would weigh = 330 t. The final module could be ready half way through the 6th year following T0.

Saclay have produced detailed drawings showing the surface and underground assembly sequences. An example of which, showing the installation of the lower four coil assembly underground, is given in appendix 3 (iii).

_The end cap air core toroids ( EACT's )_

Each EACT comprises of a cryostat housing 12 coils. The shape of the outer shell of the cryostat is similar to that of a cog wheel to allow for its insertion between the coils of the BACT.

The dimensions of the cryostat are = 12m dia x 5.6m long. They will be assembled in the surface building from large pieces prefabricated by industry weighing from 10 to 50 t. The EACT assembly line consists of four points: coil assembly, heat shield assembly, magnet assembly and vessel assembly. The PERT diagram, appendix 6, incorporates the latest work schedule from RAL dated the 12 March 1993.

Most of the EACT assembly operations take place with the axis in the vertical position. However, the EACT must be tested with its axis in its normal horizontal position. Transportation with the gantry crane, through the surface buildings to the top of the shaft, will need to be carried out with the axis in the vertical position. This due to the building height restrictions. Therefore, the EACT may have to be tested at the top of the shaft in the pit reserved for the sliding radiation shielding plug. It is here that the EACT axis rotation operation is envisaged. Alternatively, the test could be performed underground with the definitive cryogenic system.

Three months for each EACT has been allowed for final testing. It is envisaged that the cryogenic plant for the BACT will also be used for the testing of the EACT's. The tests are therefore shown taking place once the testing of the BACT coils is completed.

_Calorimeters_

The calorimeter modules would be delivered to CERN for pre-assembly, possibly within a clean air enclosure. The modules would be inserted into the cryostat. Electrical wiring and tests performed. Then the cryostat vessel would be closed. Pumping, cool down, cryo and electrical tests, emptying and warm up tests can then all be performed on the surface.

In the full LAr scenario the cryostat would be assembled into the solenoid flux return yoke. This would need to be performed on a rail system as when completed it would weigh 2300t for the barrel. The end caps would weigh = 1000 t each. They would be eventually moved over the large shaft to allow for them to be positioned below the 2500t crane.

In the hybrid calorimeter scenario the heaviest single calorimeter component could be dimensioned so as not to exceed = 330t. The modules of the hadron calorimeter could be pre-assembled into sub-units of a few hundred tonnes accordingly.

### Underground assembly of ATLAS

The summary schedule, appendix 5, shows the completion of phase 1 of the underground civil engineering some 3 and a half years after T0. If LEP is stopped at this time then phase 2 can begin - the completion of the cavern and shaft which could take a further 6 months. Whilst the civil engineers are working on the underground cavern and shaft a surface building would need to be built over the shaft. Once this is completed and equipped, 4 and a half years after T0, then work could start in the cavern. This work would include lights, ventilation, infrastructure, etc. In the middle of the 6th year after T0 the cavern could be handed over to the experiment for the underground assembly work to begin.

Appendix 4 shows a series of sketches that indicate the sequence of the installation. The 12 steps are referred to in the text below.

**Step 1** Once the underground area is equipped with the 5t travelling cranes and the rail support columns then the base module of the BACT, total weight = 330 t, would be lowered into the cavern using the surface buildings gantry crane.

**Step 2** The base module would be positioned with its coil support ties passing between the support columns. Once the base module is in position it would be fixed to the rail support system. The rail support columns with a height of = 6.5m would be tied together to provide the necessary restraints against movement. The rails would then be lowered, fixed and aligned onto the support columns.

These rails and their supporting structure would extend from the ends of the BACT to the ends of the cavern. They would allow for the elements of the central detector to be lowered from the surface building and then rolled into position. Furthermore, they will allow for the elements of the detector to be rolled back for access once the detector is completed and operational.

Step 3 The 4 BACT support feet for the cold mass would be lowered and fixed to the floor of the cavern. When this is done the 2 side modules can be lowered into the cavern.

Step 4 The 2 sides of the BACT would then be assembled in the final position. Each side of the BACT includes a support beam which would rest on the 2 support feet. The bottom module would then be fixed to the 2 side modules.

Step 5 The top of the BACT would then be lowered and assembled in the final position.

The mechanical assembly of the BACT can be completed after 2 months.

After Step 5 the remainder of the ATLAS assembly can be carried out largely in parallel. This includes:

- The completion of the BACT installation including the welding of the cold ties,

electrical and cryogenic connections, pumping, cool down, cryo and electrical tests.

- The mounting of the Muon chambers

- The installation of the calorimeters

- The installation of the end cap toroids

Step 6 The barrel calorimeter is either lowered as a complete assembled unit weighing some 2300 or it is assembled underground. The latter scenario has not been studied in detail.

Step 7 The calorimeter barrel complete with superconducting solenoid would be rolled to just inside the barrel. The Inner Detector could then be lowered and inserted within the barrel calorimeter.

Step 8 The barrel calorimeter is rolled into its final position. Scaffolding would then be erected and the final connections made. The end cap calorimeters are on the rail system in an "access" position. This, after either being lowered as complete assembled units,

each weighing some 1000 or being assembled underground.

Step 9 While work is proceeding with the calorimeters the muon chamber installation in the barrel would start.

Step 10 The EACT's are lowered as complete units onto the rail system either having been previously tested on the surface or for connection to, and testing by, the definitive cryogenic system.

Step 11 The EACT's are rolled into their final position complete with attached muon chambers. Final connections are made.

**Step 12**: The end wall muon chamber systems would be completed and the forward calorimeters would be lowered as complete units onto their elevator supports. These supports could be operated by remote control.

**The Muon system** would include the support structure and walkways which would be fixed inside the barrel. The support system could allow for the individual muon chambers to be lowered and then slid into position through the open BACT structure. Alternatively, they could be introduced through the sides of the BACT.

The lowering of the muon chambers in large batches could be done using the surface building travelling cranes. For the positioning and fixing of the muon chambers the 2 x 5t crane system will be used. Their installation would proceed in parallel with the other activities from **Step 1 to 12**. For the estimation of the time required to install the muon chambers a total number of 740 has been allowed with 4 chambers being fixed per day.

## Outline time schedule

A summary of the installation schedule is shown in appendix 5 for the hybrid calorimeter scenario. The schedule is based on the PERT diagram in appendix N6. It shows that 5 3/4 years following T0 the underground installation of the detector can start. The mechanical assembly of the BACT takes about 2 months. After the mechanical assembly of the BACT the remainder of the activities, steps 6 to 12, have an estimated duration of 13 months.

**At this conceptual stage of the project this information can only be considered as a preliminary estimate.** However, the most up-to-date schedules for the BACT from Saclay and the EACT from RAL have been used. While, the installation of the inner detector, calorimeter and the muon chambers are not (yet) based on detailed schedules. It is intended to improve and update these PERT models as more information becomes available.

## Cryogenic requirements

The helium refrigeration plant would need to have a capacity of between 3 and 4kW at 4.5K. This plant would serve the BACT, EACT's and the central solenoid. The compressors would be housed in the same surface building as that required for the LHC machine plant. For the cryogenic tests on the surface the cold box (7m x 2.5m x 4.5m high) would be located close to where the tests are to be performed. Once these tests have been completed the cold box would be lowered underground and installed in the UW cavern. It would be connected to a distribution valve box, also in the UW, from which transfer lines would be taken to serve the BACT, EACT's and solenoid.

## Infrastructure requirements

In addition to the general requirements the following items are particular to the air core toroids:- Cryogenic requirements (see above)

- The rail support system

- The reinforced concrete floor slab should be suitable for the 6000 t load (calorimeter

+000t, the BACT 1000t, the EACT's 500t and 500t for the rail support

system ).

- The permanent aluminium access structure inside the BACT.

- A surface gantry crane of 2 x 165t

- Surface overhead travelling cranes, 2 x 63t for the BACT building

- A surface overhead travelling crane, 1 x 63t for the EACT building

- Two underground travelling cranes, each 5t.

## Conclusions

It has been shown that the underground detector installation time is 15 months. Prior to this a 5 3/4 year period of civil engineering and technical service installation work for the surface and underground areas is needed. The PERT diagrams show that this coincides well with the requirements for the manufacture and surface assembly of the detector components.

It has also been shown that after the 2 months required for the mechanical assembly of the BACT a number of activities can then proceed in parallel while work on the BACT is being completed. The most time consuming single activity in the underground assembly process is the installation of the muon chambers.

**Phase 1 - Surface pre-assemble & storage**

**Work carried out at the same time as the underground civil engineering.**
