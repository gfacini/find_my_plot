Previous experiments with MDT's showed inconsistencies or a lack of reproducibility concerning the electron drift properties, if Rilsan hoses were used as gas connections. Since Rilsan is known to outgas H\({}_{2}\)O [12] the uncontrolled water content was assumed to be the reason for it. Furthermore the Magboltz prediction of the drift properties for gases with a small water content was known to be poor [10]. Both, the experiment and the simulation, led to the following assumptions

* the electron drift properties of MDT gases strongly depend on the water content
* the maximum drift time as a function of the water content has a minimum at a certain amount of H\({}_{2}\)O vapour in the gas.
* water reduces the Lorentz angle

The question arose whether the dependence of the drift properties on the water content and hence the contribution to the resolution drop is minimal at a certain water content. Furthermore it seemed interesting to study if adding aqueous vapour to the MDT gas could optimise the linearity of the space to drift time relationship and to what extent the Lorentz angle could be reduced. Apart from a possible improvement of the drift properties the water content is believed to be helpful against wire chamber ageing [12] and known to preserve the mechanical and electrical isolating properties of plastic parts [1].

We concluded that a systematic investigation where all parameters but the water content and the magnetic field are fixed became necessary.

In this note we describe the experimental setup in H8 and the method of analysis. We then present the results and discuss their implications for Atlas.

## 2 Experimental Setup

The measurements of the drift properties were performed at the Atlas test beam area H8 in spring 1997. We investigated the gases Ar, CH\({}_{4}\), N\({}_{2}\)\((91,5,4)\), which is known as the Datcha gas and Ar, CH\({}_{4}\), N\({}_{2}\), CO\({}_{2}\)\((94,3,2,1)\), which will be referred to as the four component gas in the following.

Aqueous vapour has been mixed to the drift gas by splitting the gas flow from the supply into a fraction that remained unchanged and second one that was mixed with water vapour in a bubbler (figure 1). A temperature conditioner was used to keep the bubbler at a temperature of \(14\,^{o}\)C, which at 3 bar corresponds to a water content of \(\approx\) 5300 ppm (assuming 100 % saturation). Since the saturation in the bubbler was about 80 % efficient (figure 6), any water content between 0 and 4500 ppm could be maintained in the drift chamber, by changing the ratio of the gas flows. The water temperature was permanently measured with a pt100 thermo coupler at the bubbler, while the water content was monitored just before the chamber with two Endress & Hauser DY 73 Alphasensors. They are designed to measure the dewpoint with an accuracy of \(\pm 1\,^{o}\)C.

The setup of the detectors consists of four major parts:

* a drift chamber with 16 tubes
* a silicon microstrip detector with six planes as an external reference system
* two scintillators in coincidence as a trigger

Figure 1: Schematic view of the gas system. A fraction of the gas is moistened in a bubbler to have a variable water content in the drift chamber. It is monitored with two Endress & Hauser Alphasensors.

Figure 2: Setup of the detectors. T\({}_{1}\) and T\({}_{2}\) are two scintillators in coincidence. S\({}_{1}\) to S\({}_{4}\) are the four planes of the silicon telescope. The two inner planes measure in y-direction while the outer ones measure in x and y direction. The drift tubes are in a 1 Tesla magnet.

* a magnet with a field of up to 1 Tesla

Four of the six planes of the silicon telescope measure the y-coordinate, which was the precision coordinate, with a resolution of \(<\) 10 \(\mu\)m. The other two planes measure the x-coordinate, which is the direction along the wire. For details about the setup please refer to figures 1 and 2 as well as table 1 while a detailed description about the silicon telescope can be found in [5].

The gas gain for both gases was chosen according to the Atlas baseline of 2 \(\cdot\) 10\({}^{4}\). This corresponds to a high voltage of 3270 Volt for the Datcha gas [11] and 3130 Volt for the four component gas. The latter was obtained by comparing the ADC-spectra of both gases in the Freiburg ageing setup.

## 3 Method of Analysis

### Determination of the rt-Relation

**Determination from the measurement :**

We determine the space to drift time relationship (rt-relation) with an iterative method by computing the residuum \(\Delta t\) in a space region (figure 3). The residuum \(\Delta t\) is defined as the difference between the drift time \(t_{\mathit{t}dc}\) and the silicon telescope time \(t_{\mathit{stel}}\)

\[\Delta t\quad=\quad t_{\mathit{t}dc}\,-\,t_{\mathit{stel}}\quad=\quad t_{ \mathit{t}dc}\,-\,t\,(r_{\mathit{stel}})\]

\(t_{\mathit{stel}}\) is obtained from the silicon telescope track \(r_{\mathit{stel}}\) using the rt-relation. The new rt-relation is calculated by using the mean of the residuum in a bin as the correction to the old rt-relation

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline detector & parameter & value \\ \hline \hline silicon telescope & sensitive area & \(51\times 51\) mm\({}^{2}\) \\  & planes in x /y & 2 /4 \\  & resolution & \(<\) 10 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline drift tubes & wire length / diameter & 98 mm / 50 \(\mu\)m \\  & wire material & W Re \\  & inner radius & 14.75 mm \\  & wall thickness & 0.250 mm \\  & pressure & 3 bar \\ \hline trigger & sensitive area & \(52\times 52\) mm\({}^{2}\) \\ \hline magnet & maximum field & 1 Tesla \\ \hline Datcha gas & Ar, CH\({}_{\mathrm{t}}\), N\({}_{2}\) & 91 \% 5 \% 4 \% \\  & HV / gas gain & 3270 Volt / \(2\cdot 10^{4}\) \\ \hline
4 component gas & Ar, CH\({}_{\mathrm{t}}\), N\({}_{2}\), CO\({}_{2}\) & 94 \% 3 \% 2 \% 1 \% \\  & HV / gas gain & 3130 Volt / \(2\cdot 10^{4}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Summary of important detector and gas parameters(figure 4). We use a polygon to parameterise the rt-relation.

Since the residuum distribution has approximately a Gaussian shape for \(r>2\)mm the mean value in a bin is calculated with a Gauss Fit. The RMS of the mean values in bins with \(2\,\)mm\(\,<\,r\,<\,14\,\)mm is after about eight iterations given by RMS = \(\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}\), if N is the average number of entries in a bin and \(\sigma\) the average width of the Gauss-fit. For a more detailed description see [1].

**Determination with a simulation :**

In addition to the measurements, Garfield/Magboltz simulations [2] of rt-relations were performed for both gases. A temperature of \(20^{\,o}\)C was assumed. All other input parameters were chosen according to table 1.

For simplicity the simulation was done without taking effects like diffusion and clustering into account. The resulting difference between this simulation and the one that takes the above effects into account can be up to \(20\,\)ns [2].

### Determination of the Maximum Drift Time

There are many ways to define the maximum drift time. E.g. the time between the passage of a muon at the outer edge of the tube and the arrival of the first electron at the wire. This definition is for the following reasons not very practical

1. the time of the muon passing is not known
2. at the outer edge of the tube the efficiency is zero [14]

A more practical way is to measure the width of the drift time distribution. But we 1. do not know which points of the spectrum to call start and end.
2. need to allow for a correction of the inefficiency at the wall.

We determine the maximum drift time by two methods: a fit to the whole drift time distribution using Fermi functions and secondly measuring the rt-relation and extrapolating it to the outer edge of the tube. A comparison of both methods is presented in section 4.1.

In order to have a common systematic error for simulation and measurement, the maximum drift time was calculated in both cases with the extrapolation method.

#### 3.2.1 Fermi Method

To measure the width of the drift time distribution we fit slightly modified Fermi functions, \(N_{r}(t)\) and \(N_{f}(t)\), to the rising edge and the falling edge of the spectrum* (See figure 5):

Footnote *: If the drift time distribution is flat both fits can be made simultaneously [11].

\[N_{r}(t)\,=\frac{R_{3}+R_{4}\cdot e^{\frac{t}{R_{5}}}}{\left(1+e^{\frac{R_{1}- t}{R_{2}}}\right)},\qquad\qquad N_{f}(t)\,=\,\frac{F_{3}}{\left(1+e^{\frac{F_{1}- t}{F_{2}}}\right)} \tag{1}\]

where \(F_{1}\) is the time that corresponds to the half height of the falling edge, while \(R_{1}\) is approximately the time of half height of the rising edge (modified by \(R_{4}\cdot e^{\frac{-t}{R_{5}}}\)). \(F_{2}\) and \(R_{2}\) describe the slope of the edges. Without the exponential component in \(N_{r}(t)\), the fit often fails, and the

\(R_{1}\) parameter becomes very dependent on the range of the fit.

The maximum drift time in the Fermi method is then defined as

\[t_{max}\quad:=\quad(F_{1}\,+\,\alpha F_{2})\,-\,(R_{1}\,+\,\beta\,R_{2}) \tag{2}\]

where \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) account for the fact that the maximum drift time is not equal to the time difference between the half height of the rising and falling edges. Four instead of two parameters were used in the hope that further investigations will show that \(F_{2}\) and \(R_{2}\) are gas dependent, while \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are universal. The value of \(\beta\,R_{2}\) = 1.8 ns was determined with the silicon telescope. For the analysis \(\alpha\) was assumed to be zero. In section 4.1 we will show how a better approximation for \(\alpha\) can be obtained.

#### 3.2.2 Extrapolation Method

The rt-relation was measured as described in section 3.1. The maximum drift time \(t_{max}\) is obtained by extrapolating it to the outer edge of the tube. The extrapolation becomes necessary because the tube is inefficient near the aluminium wall. We apply a linear fit through the last four points of the rt-relation.

### Determination of the Water Content

The measurement of the water content with the given Endress & Hauser Alphasensors is rather difficult since they are only accurate to \(\pm\,1\,^{o}\)C dewpoint. To give an example the table below lists the accuracy of the water monitor in different ranges for the given dewpoint accuracy.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline dewpoint & water content \(w\,\pm\,\sigma_{dp}\) & relative accuracy \\ \hline -69\(\,{}^{o}\)C \(\pm\,1\,^{o}\)C & 0.995 ppm \(\pm\) 0.147 ppm & 14.8 \% \\ \(3\,{}^{o}\)C \(\pm\,1\,^{o}\)C & 2498 ppm \(\pm\) 177 ppm & 7.1 \% \\ \(13\,{}^{o}\)C \(\pm\,1\,^{o}\)C & 5258 ppm \(\pm\) 645 ppm & 13.3 \% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Because of the difficulties we investigated whether the alphasensors are consistent within the design limits and compared their measurement with the expected water content (figure 6). The latter was calculated from the ratio of both gas flows, the temperature measured at the bubbler and the assumption, that the gas in the bubbler is 100 % saturated. The expected value is therefore an upper limit for the actual water content.

The agreement between the alphasensors was within the design limit except for the range of 0 to 100 ppm. To determine the agreement between expected and measured value we calculated their ratio, which can be regarded as the level of saturation in the bubbler. The fact that the saturation remains at about 80 % is another proof of the reliability of the water measurements. The water content during one run is calculated by averaging over both alphasensors and all slow control entries during the run. Its error is the quadratic sum

\[\delta w\quad=\sqrt{\quad\sigma_{RMS}^{2}\quad+\quad\sigma_{dp}^{2}} \tag{3}\]where \(\sigma_{RMS}\) is the RMS of the slow control entries and \(\sigma_{dp}\) the contribution from the accuracy of the water monitor. The higher the water content the more important the contribution from \(\sigma_{dp}\) becomes. At 20 ppm \(\sigma_{dp}\) is about twice as big as \(\sigma_{RMS}\) while at 4500 ppm it is about 30 times bigger. \(\delta w\) is the uncertainty of the water content shown in the figures 8 to 13 and 14 to 16.

### Resolution Drop due to Water Content Instabilities

We investigated the contribution to the resolution drop of the drift tube due to water content instabilities \(\Delta w\). An estimate for this contribution is the RMS difference \(D_{\Delta w}(w)\) of an rt

relation with a water content of \(w\) and a second with a water content of \(w+\Delta w\)

\[D_{\Delta w}(w)\quad=\quad\sqrt{\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(r_{w}(t_{i})-r_{(w -\Delta w)}(t_{i})\right)^{2}} \tag{4}\]

where the sum goes over all polygon points of the rt-relation and \(r_{w}(t_{i})\) is the drift distance that correspond to the polygon point \(i\).

For water contents between those at which measurements were made, \(r_{w}(t_{i})\) was obtained by interpolation with spline fits.

## 4 Results

### Comparison of Fermi and Extrapolation Method for the Maximum Drift Time

We calculated the maximum drift time with the Fermi and Extrapolation method. The difference \(\Delta t_{max}=t_{max_{fermi}}-t_{max_{effrap}}\) was histogrammed in figure 7 for all fully illuminated tubes of the Datcha-gas at 0.6 and 0.8 Tesla. This difference has a slight dependence on drift gas, B-field and water content, and the spread is partly due to these systematics. The choice of this data sample in figure 7 is a compromise between high statistics and a data sample without systematics.

The RMS of 1.0 ns is therefore the combined error of both methods and an upper limit for the error of each method. It accounts for the random error as well as the systematic error. The random errors of each method sum up to \(\approx 0.3\) ns, which is more than a factor of three smaller than the RMS.

This discrepancy is not fully understood. It is partly explained by the following

reduction of the Lorentz angle through water could be demonstrated. The Datcha gas is different from the four component gas in the sense that all drift property minima (maximum drift time at different B-fields, contribution to the resolution drop) show up at \(\approx 1800\,\)ppm. For the four component gas the minima of the maximum drift time at different magnetic fields are distributed over \(\approx 600\,\)ppm and the contribution to the resolution drop due to instabilities of the water content is, in the range that we investigated, a broad plateau, which does not lie in the range of the minima of the maximum drift time.

If one adds water vapour to the gases mentioned above the Lorentz angle and the maximum drift time decrease and the linearity of the rt-relation improves (up to a certain degree). The inevitable instability of the water content and hence the contribution to the resolution drop can be kept below \(10\,\mu\)m, if the stability is better than \(3\,\%\).

Based on these results the water content of the four component gas in the Freiburg ageing setup was set to \(1500\,\)ppm.
