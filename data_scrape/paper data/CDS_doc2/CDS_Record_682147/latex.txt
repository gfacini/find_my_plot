###### Abstract

This note presents the study on 1 TeV and 1.5 TeV scalar leptoquark pair production at LHC and their detection with the ATLAS apparatus. The \(2j+2e\) signature and the dominant \(t\bar{t}\) background are studied by a Monte Carlo simulation. The effect of a realistic resolution and granularity of the calorimeters is taken into account. After applying suitable kinematic cuts the signal is clearly observable for a 1 TeV leptoquark mass even for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}pb^{-1}\) and is at the limit of observability for a 1.5 TeV mass and \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\).

## 1 Introduction

Leptoquarks are color-triplet particles which couple to a lepton-quark pair; they are naturally present in many theories beyond the Standard Model [1][2][3][4]. There are different quantum numbers that leptoquarks can have according to these theories; in this study are considered _scalar_ leptoquarks with \(Q=+\frac{2}{3}\) and \(Q=-\frac{1}{3}\). Moreover it is assumed that each fermion generation has its own leptoquarks which couple only within that generation and that the coupling is chiral. The lepton-quark-leptoquark coupling strength is usually expressed by \(k\) where \(k\alpha_{em}=g_{LQ}^{2}/4\pi\) ; we assume, as is usually done, that \(k=1\).

At parton level the processes which are responsible for leptoquark (LQ) pair production are gluon-gluon fusion and quark-antiquark annihilation (fig. 1). The production cross-section is dominated by gluon-gluon fusion [5][6], which doesn't involve the l-q-LQ coupling, and is therefore only slightly dependent on \(k\)1.

The signatures for LQ pair production are:

**1)**: \(2j+l^{+}l^{-}\)
**2)**: \(2j+\nu\overline{\nu}\)
**3)**: \(2j+\nu l^{\pm}\)

with relative probabilities of occurrence of 25%, 25% and 50% respectively [5].

The first signature which, with two jets and two charged leptons in the final state, allows full recontruction of the masses of the two leptoquarks is the most promising and will be studied in the following. The main background source is \(t\overline{t}\) production with

\[t\overline{t}\to 2j+l^{+}l^{-}+X\]

Additional but smaller background contributions arise dominantly from \(Z+jets\) and can be easily removed by an invariant mass cut on the lepton pair.

Leptoquark and \(t\overline{t}\) background2 production at LHC (\(\sqrt{s}=16\) TeV) was simulated using the Monte Carlo event generation programs PYTHIA 5.6 and JETSET 7.3[7] with default settings. All the production sub-processes are currently implemented but it is assumed that leptoquarks carry specific quark and lepton quantum numbers (up and electron by default).

Footnote 2: \(m_{top}=140\) GeV is used throughout the simulation.

In fig. 2 is shown the production cross section computed by PYTHIA and in table 1 the expected rate for the \(2j+2l\) channel (where the branching ratio of 25% is included) for one year of LHC high-luminosity running (\(10^{5}pb^{-1}\) integrated luminosity). Two masses have been chosen for this study: 1 TeV and 1.5 TeV. The former is beyond the reach of HERA [8] and LEP II [9]. The latter, considering only the signal rate, is at the limit of observability at LHC.

We have compared the PYTHIA MC and the prediction in ref. [5] at SSC c.m. energy. The PYTHIA cross section is higher by a factor 2 than in ref. [5]. Moreover the LQ rapidity distribution has a quite different shape (fig. 3). This discrepancy is due3 to a bug in the structure functions used by the authors of ref. [5].

Footnote 3: F. Nessi and E. Tsesmelis spoke to the authors

In the following sections are discussed the choice of kinematic cuts, the algorithm used to reconstruct jets in the calorimeter, the effect of calorimeter resolution and finally the conclusions on the observability of leptoquarks at LHC with the ATLAS detector.

## 2 Choice of kinematic cuts

The \(t\overline{t}\) background rate is several orders of magnitude higher than the signal. It is therefore necessary to apply kinematic cuts with a high background rejection but without losing too much signal, since the production rate is already quite low, in order to extract a potential LQ signal from its dominant background.

An initial parton level study was carried out in order to optimize the kinematic cuts. Fig. 4 shows the \(p_{t}\) distribution of the quark with minimum \(p_{t}\) for \(m_{LQ}=1\) TeV and 1.5 TeV. In table 2 is shown the acceptance of different \(p_{t}\) cuts applied to the two quarks and the two electrons.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline  & \(m_{LQ}=1\) TeV & \(m_{LQ}=1.5\) TeV \\ \hline \(p_{t}^{cut}(\)GeV\()\) & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{acceptance(\%)} \\ \hline
100 & 91 & 96 \\
150 & 82 & 90 \\
200 & 68 & 84 \\
250 & 52 & 76 \\
300 & 36 & 67 \\
350 & 21 & 57 \\
400 & 10 & 46 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Acceptance of \(p_{t}\) cut on signal

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline \(m_{LQ}\) (GeV) & Events \\ \hline
200 & \(2.1\cdot 10^{6}\) \\
400 & \(8.5\cdot 10^{4}\) \\
600 & 11000 \\
800 & 1900 \\
1000 & 430 \\
1200 & 110 \\
1400 & 40 \\

\end{table}
Table 1: Rate for \(2j+2l\) channel for \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\)A cut \(p_{t}^{l,q}>200\) GeV has been chosen for both 1 TeV and 1.5 TeV leptoquarks.

In order to have more efficient background generation a \(p_{t}\) cut for the top quark (\(p_{t}^{top}>350\) GeV) has been imposed in the \(t\overline{t}\) background generation. Fig. 5 indicates that this choice does not introduce a bias in the generated sample. With this cut a sample of 50000 events was generated; the production cross-section is \(\sigma_{prod}^{t\overline{t}}\) = 29.9 pb, the branching ratio (both \(W\)s decay into electron and neutrino) is \(\frac{1}{81}\) and the rate normalized for one year at LHC (\(10^{5}pb^{-1}\)) is 37000 events. The acceptance of the cut, \(p_{t}^{l,q}>200\) GeV, for the \(t\overline{t}\) background is 0.44% (see table 3).

The distributions of \(\eta_{max}\), the maximum \(\eta\) of the electrons, for signal and background after the \(p_{t}\) cuts are applied, are shown in fig. 6. A cut \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|<\) 2.5 for both quarks and electrons has been chosen. This cut does not affect neither the signal nor the background rate but corresponds to the \(\eta\)-coverage of the Atlas Inner Detector and the range of trigger ability of the e.m. calorimeter.

In table 3 a summary of expected rates and acceptances, for signal and background, after all cuts are applied, is shown.

## 3 Electron and jet detection with ATLAS

In the ATLAS detector the electrons are identified by the e.m. calorimeter and the Inner Detector, with an assumed efficiency of 90%. The energy of the electron is measured by the calorimeter with a resolution

\[10\%/\sqrt{E_{el}}\oplus 1\%\]

In this study are used the energy, smeared according to this e.m. calorimeter resolution, and the \(\eta,\phi\) coordinates of the electron as generated by the MC.

A jet energy resolution of

\[50\%/\sqrt{E_{jet}}\oplus 3\%\]

is expected for ATLAS. The energy of the jets, reconstructed by the algorithm described in the following section, is smeared accordingly.

### Jet reconstruction algorithm

In order to simulate jet detection and measurement with the ATLAS calorimeters the transverse energies4 of the particles generated by the MC are deposited in a grid of cells with size

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(m_{LQ}=1\)TeV & \(m_{LQ}=1.5\) TeV & \(t\overline{t}\) \\ \hline Rate (\(yr^{-1}\)) & 430 & 20 & 37000 \\ acceptance(\%) & 67 & 82 & 0.44 \\ Rate (after cuts) & 288 & 16 & 163 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: effect of kinematic cuts at _parton level_\(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta=0.1\times 0.1\), where \(\phi\) is the azimuth and \(\eta\) the pseudorapidity. The coverage used is \(\mid\eta\mid<3\) corresponding to the coverage of the barrel and the end-cap calorimeters of the proposed detector.

To reconstruct jets, we studied an algorithm which:

1. finds the highest \(p_{t}\) cell, provided it is over a certain \(p_{t}\) threshold, chosen to be 10 GeV;
2. reconstructs \(p_{t},\eta,\phi\) of the jet using a square of \(n\times n\) cells centred on this "seed" cell;
3. if \(p_{t}^{jet}\) is above a certain threshold, retains the jet, and after finding the highest \(p_{t}\) cell among the remaining unused cells, repeats the above procedure until no more cells above threshold are left;
4. distributes the energy of cells belonging to more than one jet proportionally to \(p_{t}^{jet}\) and recomputes \(p_{t},\eta,\phi\) for these jets;
5. removes jets associated to electrons from the list and orders remaining ones with decreasing \(p_{t}\);

This algorithm has been compared to another algorithm which:

1. scrolls a _window_ of \(n\times n\) cells across the whole \(\eta\times\phi\) space to find the highest \(p_{t}\) jet;
2. if \(p_{t}^{jet}\) is above threshold, retains the jet and removes used cells;
3. repeats the first point until no jets above threshold are left;
4. as (5) above.

To optimize the square (or "cone") size, single jet reconstruction has been studied at _parton level_, after final-state radiation, considering the quark and the gluons radiated from each final state quark, in an \(\eta\times\phi\) square centred on the quark direction; at _particle level_, that is considering particles after hadronization, the study was performed using physical particles in the square centred on the quark direction or using the algorithms discussed above and choosing the accepted jet nearest to the original quark.

In fig. 7 is shown the electron-jet mass reconstruction efficiency, without energy smearing and for a single jet in the central region of the detector, in a mass bin of \(\pm 50\) GeV around the generated 1 TeV LQ mass, for a sample of events passing the kinematic cuts, as a function of the square size and for different jet energy collection algorithms. When partons coming only from one of the two quarks produced in the LQ decay are used, the efficiency increases with the size of the square showing that these jets have a quite wide angular aperture. If also partons from the other quark or from initial-state radiation are included or if final state particles are used, it is found that the efficiency grows up to a square size of \(13\times 13\) and \(9\times 9\) cells (that is about \(\Delta\mbox{R}^{5}=0.5\)) respectively and then decreases because of the inclusion of too many initial-state radiation and underling event products. The effect of the incomplete acceptance in a finite cone size and of the smearing due to initial-state radiation and spectator energy can be seen in the reconstructed LQ mass distribution (fig. 8).

There are non-gaussian tails especially for masses smaller than the generated mass in both cases (_partons_ and _particles_). In case of parton-reconstructed masses, the non-gaussian tails decrease as the cone size increases, indicating that they correspond to energy lost outside the cone. In case of particle-reconstructed masses, tails at high mass appear when the cone size get large, indicating that significant spectator energy has been included in the jet energy.

When the jet is reconstructed using the _"max \(p_{t}\) cell"_ algorithm (algorithm 1 in fig. 7) the reconstruction efficiency is only slightly lower than for "particle" reconstruction (where the information about the original quark direction was used). The _"window"_ algorithm (algorithm 2) has an efficiency even higher than for partons for cone sizes less than \(5\times 5\) cells but displays large losses for bigger sizes, showing that this algorithm is very good only when the contribution from spectator energy is negligible.

The same study for the reconstruction efficiency of both LQ masses in a \(\pm 50\) GeV mass bin (for \(m_{\it LQ}=1\) TeV) is summarized in fig. 9. The maximum efficiency of the _window_ algorithm, slightly smaller than \(50\%\) for a size of \(7\times 7\) cells, is about the same as the maximum efficiency of the _max \(p_{t}\) cell_ algorithm obtained with a size of \(11\times 11\) cells. The latter algorithm has been chosen because of its higher speed with respect to the former.

The results for a 1.5 TeV leptoquark (see fig. 10) are essentially the same.

A square of \(11\times 11\) cells has been chosen for both LQ masses as optimum size. In real running conditions, because of the _pile-up_, not included in this study since its contribution to the jet energy resolution is not the dominant one for high energy jets, the optimum cone size could be smaller than the one found here.

## 4 Results

### \(m_{\it LQ}=1\) TeV

The electron-jet mass distribution for the events passing the kinematic cuts ( 2 jets and 2 electrons with \(p_{t}>200\) GeV and \(\mid\eta\mid<2.5\) each) is shown in fig. 11. The two highest-\(p_{t}\) jets are used. The mass resolution is \(\sigma_{m}=27\) GeV. Since in about one third of the events there are more than two reconstructed jets passing the cuts (see table 4), the significance of a possible signal over the expected background (\(S/\sqrt{B}\)) has been studied as a function of the jet multiplicity. In table 5 are shown the expected rates of reconstructed electron-jet combinations, normalized to one year of LHC running, in a mass bin of \(\pm 2\sigma_{m}\) around the LQ mass, for different allowed jet multiplicities. Quoted are the statistical errors of the MC sample. The best statistical significance is achieved for allowed jet multiplicities of up to four; the statistical significance of the signal is 69.

Instead of using all the mass combinations it is possible to select the pair of masses that has the minimum mass difference out of all the possible pairs. At _parton level_, without energy smearing, the "right" pair of masses can be selected in this way with an efficiency of 97.8%. In table 6 are quoted the normalized number of combinations in a \(\pm 2\sigma_{m}\) mass bin with this selection criterion. In this case \(\sigma_{m}\) is about 25 GeV and the best statistical significance is 75. This figure is slightly better than the one obtained using all the mass combinations.

In fig. 12 is shown the electron-jet mass distribution of the signal added to the background, normalized for \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\) and randomized to simulate one experiment.

Table 8: Signal and background mass combinations in \(\pm 70\) GeV mass bin selected by _minimum mass difference criterion_ for \(m_{LQ}=1.5\) TeVPoisson distribution with \(<n>=40\), were superimposed to each generated event. Minimum bias events were generated using PYTHIA (6 charged particles per unit pseudorapidity). The resulting effect was an increase of both the mean and the width of the mass peak. In reality, since the signal pulse from the calorimeter has a bipolar shaping, the mean should not be affected by the pile-up. This is not taken into account in this simple simulation. The increase of the width is compatible with the contribution to the jet energy resolution computed with full GEANT simulations [10]. To minimize this effect only cells above an \(E_{t}\) threshold were used in the jet reconstruction. As shown in fig. 17 the width of the reconstructed mass peak increases in presence of pile-up, but this effect depends on the cell \(E_{t}\) threshold. With a sufficiently high threshold of 1 GeV, the jet energy resolution still dominates the mass resolution.

## 5 Conclusions

The _two lepton + two jet_ signature for leptoquark pair production, for \(m_{LQ}<1.5\) TeV is observable with the ATLAS detector at LHC over one year of high-luminosity running. For \(m_{LQ}=1\) TeV the signal is clearly observable above from the background even for \(10^{4}pb^{-1}\) integrated luminosity. A leptoquark of 1.5 TeV mass is at the limit of observability after one year of running at design luminosity.
