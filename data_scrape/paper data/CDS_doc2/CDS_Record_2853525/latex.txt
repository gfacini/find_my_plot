## Preliminary analysis of the luminosity calibration of the ATLAS 13.6 TeV data recorded in 2022

This note presents figures and tables from the preliminary analysis of the ATLAS luminosity calibration for the data recorded in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13.6\) TeV in 2022. The tables include a detailed breakdown of the systematic uncertainties.

## 1 Introduction

This note collects figures and tables from the luminosity calibration of the \(\sqrt{s}=13.6\) TeV pp collision data sample recorded by the ATLAS detector at the LHC in 2022.

The uncertainty in the integrated luminosity for data recorded in 2022 is 2.2%, following the methodology discussed in Ref. [1], using the LUCID-2 detector [2] for the primary luminosity measurement, complemented by measurements using the inner detector and calorimeters. The uncertainty is dominated by effects from horizontal-vertical correlations, known as non-factorisation, in the bunch-density distributions during the beam-separation scans used to determine the absolute luminosity scale, as well as by uncertainties in transferring this calibration from the data-taking conditions of the absolute luminosity calibration to the conditions of routine physics data-taking. Various beam-, calibration method-, consistency-, reproducibility-, as well as stability-related effects provide smaller contributions to the overall uncertainty.

Figures related to the absolute luminosity calibration based on van-der-Meer (vdM) scans are shown in Section 2, figures and a table illustrating the calibration transfer and the long-term stability monitoring for physics data-taking are given in Section 3, and tables summarizing the systematic uncertainties are shown in Section 4.

## 2 Van der Meer scans

Figures that illustrate the analysis of the van der Meer (vdM) scans. In all cases the LUCID Bi2HitOR algorithm is used. This algorithm counts the total number of hits in the four LUCID Bi2 tubes on each side of ATLAS. All variables are defined in Ref. [1].

Figure 1: Visible interaction rate \(\mu_{\mathrm{vis}}\) per unit bunch population product \(n_{1}n_{2}\) vs. beam separation during a horizontal vdM scan, for bunch slot (BCID) 103 in scan 1 of 2022, using the LUCID Bi2HitOR algorithm. The measured rate is shown by the red circles, the background-subtracted rate by the pink squares, the estimated background from noise and afterglow by the blue upward-pointing triangles and that from beamâ€“gas interactions by the green downward-pointing triangles. The error bars show the statistical uncertainties, which are in some cases smaller than the symbol sizes.

Figure 2: Time evolution of the horizontal and vertical convolved beam widths (\(\Sigma\)) measured in four consecutive on-axis vdM-scan pairs. The points are the values measured for each bunch separately, plotted at the time of the middle of the scan. The lines are linear fits to the data; the averaged fitted slopes and their RMS spreads are displayed in the legend.

Figure 3: Time evolution of the bunch-averaged horizontal and vertical convolved beam widths (\(\Sigma\)) measured in four consecutive on-axis vdM-scan pairs, and in two off-axis scan pairs (circled symbols). The points are the values measured for each bunch separately, plotted at the time of the middle of the scan. The lines are linear fits to the on-axis data. A large deviation of the off-axis convolved width from the solid line of the same colour is indicative of a potential non-factorisation bias.

Figure 4: Bunch-by-bunch horizontal convolved beam width (\(\Sigma_{x}\)) measured in the four on-axis scan pairs. The vertical lines represent the weighted bunch-averaged value for each scan pair separately. The error bars are statistical only, and are approximately the size of the marker. The numbers given in the legend are the bunch averaged values for each scan. The statistical uncertainty in the numbers is smaller than the precision shown.

Figure 5: Bunch-by-bunch vertical convolved beam width (\(\Sigma_{y}\)) measured in the four on-axis scan pairs. The vertical lines represent the weighted bunch-averaged value for each scan pair separately. The error bars are statistical only, and are approximately the size of the marker. The numbers given in the legend are the bunch averaged values for each scan. The statistical uncertainty in the numbers is smaller than the precision shown.

Figure 6: Bunch-by-bunch peak specific interaction rate measured for the horizontal scan in the four on-axis scan pairs. The vertical lines represent the weighted bunch-averaged value for each scan pair separately. The error bars are statistical only, and are approximately the size of the marker. \(\mu_{\rm vis}^{\rm max}\) denotes the maximal fitted visible interaction rate \(\mu_{\rm vis}\) over the scan. \(n_{1},\ n_{2}\) are the number of protons in the two colliding bunches in beam 1 and 2. The numbers given in the legend are the bunch averaged values for each scan. The statistical uncertainty in the numbers is smaller than the precision shown.

Figure 7: Bunch-by-bunch peak specific interaction rate measured for the vertical scan in the four on-axis scan pairs. The vertical lines represent the weighted bunch-averaged value for each scan pair separately. The error bars are statistical only, and are approximately the size of the marker. \(\mu_{\rm vis}^{\rm max}\) denotes the maximal fitted visible interaction rate \(\mu_{\rm vis}\) over the scan. \(n_{1},~{}n_{2}\) are the number of protons in the two colliding bunches in beam 1 and 2. The numbers given in the legend are the bunch averaged values. The statistical uncertainty in the numbers is smaller than the precision shown.

Figure 8: Fully corrected, bunch-by-bunch \(\sigma_{\rm vis}\) values measured in the four on-axis scan pairs. The error bars are statistical only. The vertical lines represent the weighted bunch-averaged visible cross-section, separately for each scan pair. The numbers given in the legend are the bunch averaged values for each scan and their statistical errors.

Figure 9: Visible-cross-section measured in the four on-axis scan pairs, as a function of time in the vdM-calibration fill, after beam-beam (BB) correction, and either before (red squares) or after (black circles) non-factorisation (NF) correction. The horizontal dashed line represents the non-factorisation-corrected \(\sigma_{\rm vis}\) value averaged over the four scans. All \(\sigma_{\rm vis}\) values shown refer to the average over all 144 bunches, whereas the non-factorisation correction is obtained only from the 9 bunches for which beamspot data are available. The error bars show the statistical uncertainty and the spread among the 144 bunches. The horizontal axis shows the time half-way between that of the peaks of the horizontal and vertical scans.

Figure 10: Relative deviation of the bunch-by-bunch visible-cross-section measured in the four on-axis scan pairs with respect to the fully corrected value, averaged over all scans and all 144 colliding bunches, as a function of time in the vdM-calibration fill, after beam-beam (BB) correction, and either before (red symbols) or after (black symbols) non-factorisation (NF) correction. Each of the nine shapes (open or filled squares, circles, triangles, etc) is associated with a specific colliding-bunch pair for which luminous-region data are available; the corresponding bunch-crossing identifier (BCID) is indicated next to the symbol. On the horizontal axis, each cluster of symbols is centred on the time half-way between the peaks of the horizontal and vertical scans. The Roman numbers in the figure refer to the number of the on-axis scan pairs.

Table 1: Range of shifts in the ratios of the Tile-calorimeter luminosity and the track-counting luminosity (denoted as Selection A in Ref. [1]) in a set of LHC fills from 29 September to 1 October 2022, with increasing number of simultaneous interactions (\(\mu\)), increasing number of bunches, and moving from isolated bunches to bunch trains. These ranges of shifts probe the linearity of the track-counting algorithm, which is used in Figure 11 to extrapolate the absolute LUCID calibration from the vdM regime (low-\(\mu\), low number of bunches, isolated bunches) to the data-taking conditions of physics running (high-\(\mu\), large number of bunches, bunch trains). The fills are selected and compared such that either all three running conditions are modified (1-step extrapolation), or only one or two (2-step extrapolation). The comparison of track-counting is done to different Tile cell families, corresponding to different regions in the ATLAS Tile calorimeter. The Tile cell families used to obtain the range of shifts are indicated for each extrapolation step. The Tile data has been corrected for residual ambient activation, except for one extrapolation step indicated with (*), where at high \(\mu\)-values the bias from the activation is considered small. The rounded maximum shifts are used as an upper limit on the impact of the extrapolation on the luminosity calibration. This is added linearly with the potential effect from missing laser corrections, which trace gain changes in the Tile readout photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). These corrections are determined with a laser calibration system that injects laser pulses into the Tile PMTs between physics runs and records the integrated PMT current. The upper limit on the total impact of the extrapolation from the vdM to the regime of physics data-taking is symmetrized and considered as calibration transfer uncertainty.

Figure 12: Ratios of the per-fill integrated luminosity measured by the electromagnetic endcap calorimeter (EMEC): A-side, C-side and the mean of both, to that measured by track-counting (denoted as Selection A in Ref. [1]) in ten physics fills surrounding the vdM fill, as function of the LHC fill number. The vdM fill is indicated by the blue arrow. The ratios are normalised such that the average over all ten fills is unity. The legends show the RMS difference between the calorimeter and track-counting measurements in each case. The largest RMS across the calorimeter subsystems (Figure 13 and here) sets the calibration-anchoring uncertainty.

Figure 13: Ratios of the per-fill integrated luminosity measured by the electromagnetic forward calorimeter (FCal): A-side, C-side and the mean of both, to that measured by track-counting (denoted as Selection A in Ref. [1]) in ten physics fills surrounding the vdM fill, as function of the LHC fill number. The vdM fill is indicated by the blue arrow. The ratios are normalised such that the average over all ten fills is unity. The legends show the RMS difference between the calorimeter and track-counting measurements in each case. The largest RMS across the calorimeter subsystems (Figure 12 and here) sets the calibration-anchoring uncertainty.

Figure 14: Fractional differences in fill-integrated luminosity between the EMEC, FCal and LUCID Bi2HitOR luminosity measurements and the track-counting luminosity algorithm (denoted as Selection A in Ref. [1]), as a function of the fractional cumulative integrated luminosity in 2022. The EMEC and FCal measurements are averages of the respective A- and C-side algorithms. The \(\mu\)-correction fill corresponds to the dataset used for the calibration of LUCID to track-counting for physics data-taking, the anchoring region marks the range of ten fills around the vdM fill used for normalising the calorimeter measurements to track-counting. The selection of fills is restricted to those passing standard data-quality requirements.

Figure 15: Fractional differences in fill-integrated luminosity between the EMEC and FCal luminosity measurements (A- and C-sides separately) and the baseline LUCID Bi2HitOR luminosity algorithm, as a function of the fractional cumulative integrated luminosity in 2022. The \(\mu\)-correction fill corresponds to the dataset used for the calibration of LUCID to track-counting for physics data-taking, the anchoring region marks the range of ten fills around the vdM fill used for normalising the calorimeter measurements to track counting. The selection of fills is restricted to those passing standard data-quality requirements.

Figure 16: Distributions of relative differences in fill-integrated luminosity between the EMEC luminosity measurements (A-side and C-side separately) and the baseline LUCID Bi2HitOR luminosity measurement, weighted by the integrated luminosity in each fill, for 2022. The selection of fills is restricted to those passing standard data-quality requirements; the quoted integrated luminosity is the one delivered by the LHC, not corrected for ATLAS detector and trigger readiness. The mean and RMS values for each algorithm are indicated in the legend. The largest mean deviation across the calorimeter subsystems and track counting (Figures 17â€“18 and here) sets the long-term stability uncertainty.

Figure 17: Distributions of relative differences in fill-integrated luminosity between the FCal luminosity measurements (A-side and C-side separately) and the baseline LUCID Bi2HitOR luminosity measurement, weighted by the integrated luminosity in each fill, for 2022. The selection of fills is restricted to those passing standard data-quality requirements; the quoted integrated luminosity is the one delivered by the LHC, not corrected for ATLAS detector and trigger readiness. The mean and RMS values for each algorithm are indicated in the legend. The largest mean deviation across the calorimeter subsystems and track counting (Figures 16 and 18 and here) sets the long-term stability uncertainty.

Figure 18: Distributions of the relative differences in fill-integrated luminosity between the track-counting luminosity measurements and the baseline LUCID Bi2HitOR luminosity measurement, weighted by the integrated luminosity in each fill, for 2022. The selection of fills is restricted to those passing standard data-quality requirements and tightened to reject fills suffering from known Inner-Detector operational issues that affect the track-counting luminosity measurement. The quoted integrated luminosity is the one delivered by the LHC, not corrected for ATLAS detector and trigger readiness. The mean and RMS values for each algorithm are indicated in the legend. The largest mean deviation across the calorimeter subsystems and track counting (Figures 16-17 and here) sets the long-term stability uncertainty.

## 4 Systematic Uncertainties

The systematic uncertainty in the integrated luminosity for the data sample from 2022 as well as a breakdown of the uncertainties are given in Table 2. The absolute integrated luminosity and uncertainty numbers are quoted in Table 3, using datasets based on data-quality requirements for three different trigger configurations. The relative uncertainty is independent of the specific data-quality selection and rounded to 2.2%.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Data sample & 2022 \\ \hline Uncertainty contributions [\%]: & \\ Statistical uncertainty & 0.01 \\ Fit model & 0.24 \\ Background subtraction & 0.06 \\ FBCT bunch-by-bunch fractions & 0.01 \\ Ghost-charge and satellite bunches & 0.17 \\ DCCT calibration & 0.20 \\ Orbit-drift correction & 0.06 \\ Beam position jitter & \textless{}0.01 \\ Non-factorisation effects & 1.07 \\ Beamâ€“beam effects & 0.35 \\ Emittance damping correction & 0.21 \\ Length scale calibration & 0.03 \\ Inner detector length scale & 0.24 \\ Magnetic non-linearity & 0.32 \\ Bunch-by-bunch \(\sigma_{\text{vis}}\) consistency & 0.50 \\ Scan-to-scan reproducibility & 0.27 \\ Reference specific luminosity & 0.43 \\ \hline Subtotal vdM calibration & 1.45 \\ \hline Calibration transfer & 1.50 \\ Calibration anchoring & 0.53 \\ Long-term stability & 0.41 \\ \hline Total uncertainty [\%] & 2.19 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Systematic uncertainties associated with the preliminary luminosity calibration of the 2022 \(pp\) data sample at \(\sqrt{s}=13.6\) TeV. The fractional systematic uncertainty is broken down into four main contributions: absolute vdM calibration (detailed per uncertainty source, and subtotal), the calibration transfer from the vdM to the physics regime, calibration anchoring of the calorimeters for physics runs, and long-term stability of the luminometer response.
