# Modeling the Mobility and Lorentz angle

for the ATLAS Pixel Detector

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The electron and hole mobility plays a key role in determining the cluster shape in the ATLAS silicon pixel detectors. A proper model of the mobility is therefore important for accurately simulating track reconstruction. Various mobility models are studied in the ATLAS simulation framework to determine their predictions for Run 2 conditions. One way to probe the mobility directly in data is to study the Lorentz angle. Measurements of the Lorentz angle are used to assess the mobility model quality. As a result of these studies, the default mobility model is updated from the Run 1 default.

## 1 Introduction

As minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) traverse the silicon sensors of the ATLAS pixel detector, electron-hole pairs are generated and drift in the presence of an electric field. These ionization charges travel at a velocity set by the mobility \(\mu=v/E\). The mobility depends on the temperature and also on the electric field. When the field strength is low, the mobility \(\mu_{0}\) is nearly independent of the field. In contrast, when the field strength is high, the mobility is nearly inversely proportional to the field and therefore the velocity is nearly constant (saturation velocity or \(v_{s}\)). The critical electric field (\(E_{c}\)) defines the transition between these two asymptotic regimes. In planar sensors like the one illustrated in Fig. 1, electrons and holes travel at an angle with respect to the electric field as a result of the Lorentz force from the magnetic field. This angle is called the Lorentz angle (\(\theta_{L}\)) and is set by \(\tan\theta_{L}=r\mu B\), where \(r\) is the Hall scattering factor that is numerically close to unity [1]. Therefore, the mobility plays a key role in determining the cluster shape which has important implications for the resolution on the track reconstructed parameters.

The ATLAS inner tracking detector (ID) is composed of three components: a pixel detector, a silicon strip detector (SCT) and a transition radiation tracker (TRT). These detectors are immersed in a 2 T solenoidal magnetic field. Surrounding the ID are calorimeters and muon tracking chambers that altogether provide nearly \(4\pi\) solid angle particle detection [2]. Track reconstruction from the ID covers the full \(2\pi\) in azimuth and extends out to1\(|\eta|<2.5\). The pixel detector [3; 4] consists of four barrel layers and a total of six disk layers, three at each end of the barrel region. The four barrel layers are composed of \(n^{+}\)-in-\(n\) planar silicon

sensors at 33, 50.5, 88.5, and 122.5 mm from the geometric center of the ATLAS detector. There are 3D sensors at the ends of the innermost barrel layer, which are not used in the following analysis because their Lorentz angle is negligible as a result of the charge carrier drift direction. Due to the sensor material, electrons (and not holes2) are responsible for most of the collected charge. The sensors on the innermost barrel layer (the insertable \(b\)-layer or IBL [4]) are 200 \(\mu m\) thick, while the sensors in the other layers are 250 \(\mu m\) thick. At high \(|z|\) on the innermost barrel layer, there are 3D sensors [5] that are 230 \(\mu m\) thick. The pitch of the IBL sensors is \(50\times 250\)\(\mu m^{2}\) while for the other layers, the pitch is \(50\times 400\)\(\mu m^{2}\). Charge is digitized and read out using the FEI3 [6] pixel chip on the outer layers and the FEI4 [7] chip on the innermost barrel layer. Analogue to digital conversion is performed using the time over threshold (ToT) method with 8 bits of range for FEI3 and 4 bits for FEI4.

Footnote 2: In contrast, holes are the primary charge carrier for the SCT.

In the production of simulated data samples, particle interactions with detector material are modeled by a combination of Geant4 [8] and custom algorithms for charge deposition, transport, and digitization. A MIP generates about 80 electron-hole pairs per micron in silicon3, with large fluctuations that are simulated by the Bichsel model [9]. The mobility model used for Run 1 and the first part of Run 2 is an industry standard temperature and electric-field dependent function from the Jacoboni et al. review article published in 1977 [10]. The details of this model are described in Sec. 2, but measurements of the Lorentz angle during Runs 1 and 2 discovered a disagreement between the simulation and data. In particular, the actual Lorentz angle (\(\approx 200\) mrad) in the planar pixel sensors was about 10% too high in simulation. Therefore, an ad-hoc 90% scaling factor for the Lorentz angle has been used up to now in order to improve agreement with data.

Footnote 3: The mean ionization energy in silicon is about 3.6 eV and \(\langle dE/dx\rangle\approx 3.9\) MeV/cm.

The purpose of this note is to explore various mobility models in order to identify a better fit for our data and ideally remove the ad-hoc scaling factor. Section 2 reviews the most commonly used mobility models in both the low and high electric field regimes, including recent developments. Predictions for the mobility for a variety of models using Run 2 conditions are presented in Sec. 3. Comparisons with data are shown in Sec. 4 and the note concludes in Sec. 5.

## 2 Mobility Models

Generically, mobility modeling can be decomposed into three pieces: low-field, high-concentration, and high-field components. For collider applications, the concentration is sufficiently low that we can ignore concentration-induced effects (e.g. carrier-carrier scattering). The following sections describe available models in the literature for both the low-field mobility and models for extending to high electric fields (\(\gg\mathcal{O}(\mathrm{kV/cm})\)). The models considered here were identified after a literature search that included all of the models listed in the state-of-the-art Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) packages Silvaco [11] and Synopsys [12].

### Low Field Mobility

To make it easier to compare models and extract values, the temperature dependence for all models is normalized to 300 K (\(T_{n}=T/300\) K). The names given below are chosen to be representative of the models and values used, but do not always indicate all authors whose work a given parameterization is based on. The list below is also not exhaustive - the goal is to include plausible models that are based on fits with data. For example, the Silvaco default [11] model uses round numbers with an analytic temperature dependence4\(\mu_{e,0}=1000\times T_{n}^{-3/2}\) cm\({}^{2}/(\rm V\cdot s)\) and \(\mu_{h,0}=500\times T_{n}^{-3/2}\) cm\({}^{2}/(\rm V\cdot s)\). Since these values significantly differ from other models based on data, the model is excluded from the list.

Footnote 4: The dominant contribution to the mobility is carrier-phonon scattering. Phonons follow Bose-Einstein statistics, so the number density is given by \(\langle n\rangle=(e^{\hbar\omega/k_{B}T}-1)^{-1}\approx\frac{k_{B}}{\hbar\omega }T\) at high \(T\). We can then write \(\mu\sim q\tau/m\propto(\langle n\rangle\times v_{e/h}^{\rm thermal})^{-1}\sim(T \times T^{1/2})^{-1}=T^{-3/2}\), where the thermal velocity has the usual form \(v_{e/h}^{\rm thermal}\sim\sqrt{k_{B}T/m}\).

1. **Jacoboni-Canali**[10]. This is the ATLAS Run 1 default mobility [13]. The model is from the Jacoboni et al. review article, which is based on the parameterization from Ref. [14] and the numerical values in Ref. [15]. However, the values are slightly mis-transcribed for electrons. In particular, the saturation velocity in Ref. [15] is given as \(v_{s}=\mu_{e,0}\times E_{c}=1.42\times 10^{9}\;T^{-2.42}\times 1.01\)\(T^{1.55}=1.43\times 10^{9}\;T^{-0.87}\) cm/s whereas in Ref. [10], the same value is quoted as \(1.53\times 10^{9}\;T^{-0.87}\) cm/s. Normalizing the temperature dependence to 300 K gives the electron and hole mobilities displayed in Eq. 1 and 2, respectively. This model is the most widely-used in the device simulation literature. \[\mu_{e,0}(T) =1533.7\;\rm cm^{2}/(\rm V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-2.42}\] (1) \[\mu_{h,0}(T) =463.9\;\rm cm^{2}/(\rm V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-2.20}\] (2)
2. **Canali**[15]. This is the same as the Jacoboni-Canali model, but with the corrected value for the electron mobility, as shown in Eq. 3. This results in a low-field mobility that is just over 6% smaller for electrons than the value presented in Jacoboni et al. [10]. Note that Ref. [15] presents the low field mobility and the critical electric field, from which the saturation velocity can be extracted: \(v_{s}=E_{c}\mu_{0}\). This parameterization is based on data collected with lightly doped silicon spanning 300-430 K and electric fields spanning \(10^{3}\)-\(10^{5}\) V/cm applied parallel to the \(\langle 111\rangle\) silicon lattice orientation. \[\mu_{e,0}(T)=1437.7\;\rm cm^{2}/(\rm V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-2.42}\] (3)
3. **Arora**[16]. This model is based on a series of experimental data [17; 18; 19] at high temperatures (200-500 K) and high dopant concentration (\(10^{13}\)-\(10^{20}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)). The low concentration limit (bulk doping in ATLAS pixels is \(\mathcal{O}(10^{12})\)) of the full formula is presented in Eq. 4 and 5 for electrons and holes, respectively. The first term in each of Eq. 4 and 5 is the minimum concentration-independent mobility while the second term is the zero concentration limit of a concentration-dependent mobility correction. \[\mu_{e,0}(T) =88.0\;\rm cm^{2}/(\rm V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-0.57}+1252.0\; \rm cm^{2}/(\rm V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-2.33}\] (4) \[\mu_{h,0}(T) =54.3\;\rm cm^{2}/(\rm V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-0.57}+407.0\;\rm cm^ {2}/(\rm V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-2.33}\] (5)4. **Masetti**[20]: A large range of dopant concentrations (\(10^{13}\)-\(10^{20}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)) were measured at room temperature and different models were required to fit phosphorous and arsenic doping for high fields. As phosphorus is used for the ATLAS pixel detector, those are the values presented below. The low concentration limit of the full formula is presented in Eq. 6 and 7 for electrons and holes, respectively. The temperature-dependence is taken from Ref. [15] (an analytic value of \(-3/2\) is used by default in Silvaco for this model). \[\mu_{e,0}(T) =1414.0\;\mathrm{cm}^{2}/(\mathrm{V}\cdot\mathrm{s})\times T_{n} ^{-2.42}\] (6) \[\mu_{h,0}(T) =470.5\;\mathrm{cm}^{2}/(\mathrm{V}\cdot\mathrm{s})\times T_{n} ^{-2.2}\] (7)
5. **Klaassen**[21]. This model is based on a wide range of experimental data in order to incorporate many physical effects such as lattice scattering, impurity scattering, carrier-carrier scattering, and impurity clustering. The values at room temperature are from Ref. [20] and the temperature dependence is refit. The relevant component for the temperature and dopant concentrations used by ALTAS is the lattice scattering mobility, shown in Eq. 8 and 9 for electrons and holes, respectively. \[\mu_{e,0}(T) =1414\;\mathrm{cm}^{2}/(\mathrm{V}\cdot\mathrm{s})\times T_{n} ^{-2.285}\] (8) \[\mu_{h,0}(T) =470.5\;\mathrm{cm}^{2}/(\mathrm{V}\cdot\mathrm{s})\times T_{n} ^{-2.247}\] (9)
6. **Lambardi**[22]. As with the Klaassen model, the values at room temperature are from Ref. [20] and the temperature dependence is refit. This model incorporates many high-field effects (\(10^{14}\) up to \(10^{17}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)) that are not relevant for the ATLAS pixel bulk. The low concentration limit of the full formula is presented in Eq. 10 and 11 for electrons and holes, respectively. This is the default mobility model in Synopsis [12]. \[\mu_{e,0}(T) =1414\;\mathrm{cm}^{2}/(\mathrm{V}\cdot\mathrm{s})\times T_{n} ^{-2.5}\] (10) \[\mu_{h,0}(T) =470.5\;\mathrm{cm}^{2}/(\mathrm{V}\cdot\mathrm{s})\times T_{n} ^{-2.2}\] (11)
7. **Bologna**[23, 24]. The main new feature of this model is its extended temperature range, spanning 300-700 K. Furthermore, it reformulates some high-concentration behavior. The low concentration limit of the full formula is presented in Eq. 12 and 13 for electrons and holes, respectively. \[\mu_{e,0}(T) =1441\;\mathrm{cm}^{2}/(\mathrm{V}\cdot\mathrm{s})\times T_{n} ^{-2.45-0.11T_{n}}\] (12) \[\mu_{h,0}(T) =470.5\;\mathrm{cm}^{2}/(\mathrm{V}\cdot\mathrm{s})\times T_{n} ^{-2.16}\] (13)
8. **Hamburg-Thomas**[25]. Recent time of flight measurements are used to fit the parameterization from Ref. [14]. This determination also includes an assessment of systematic uncertainties, which are at the sub-percent in most cases and never more than a few percent. Mobility determinations were performed for both the \(\langle 100\rangle\) and \(\langle 111\rangle\) orientations. The ATLAS detector uses a mix of orientations, with the latter used by the IBL [26, 27]. One low field parameterization is used for both crystal orientations and is reported in Eqs. 14 and 15 for electrons and holes, respectively. The values in parentheses are the uncertainty on the last digits. \[\mu_{e,0}(T) = 1440(15)\ \mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-2.260(7)}}\] (14) \[\mu_{h,0}(T) = 474(10)\ \mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-2.619(7)}}\] (15)
9. **Hamburg**[28, 29]. Recent high precision measurements with \(\langle 100\rangle\) silicon lattice orientation data are fit with a large range in bias voltage. A new high field parameterization (with high luminosity colliders in mind) is introduced and the low field mobility is evaluated using a global fit to the data. The resulting values are shown in Eq. 16 and 17 for electrons and holes, respectively. \[\mu_{e,0}(T) = 1430\ \mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-1.99}}\] (16) \[\mu_{h,0}(T) = 457\ \mathrm{cm^{2}/(V\cdot s)\times T_{n}^{-2.80}}\] (17)

### High Field Mobility

There is some ambiguity in how to extend the above models to high fields5. Some of the low field models predict the critical electric field (\(E_{c}\)) and the saturation velocity (\(v_{s}\)) from which \(\mu_{0}=v_{s}/E_{c}\) (1,3), others predict \(E_{c}\) and \(\mu_{0}\) which gives \(v_{s}=\mu_{0}E_{c}\) (2) and others still predict \(\mu_{0}\) directly (4-10). Many extrapolations to high field use the carrier velocity, for which \(E\mu_{0}\) is a reasonable choice. This creates a slight mis-match when a model does predict \(v_{s}\) because \(\mu_{0}^{\mathrm{model\ 1}}E/v_{s}^{\mathrm{model\ 2}}=E/E_{c}^{\mathrm{model\ 1}} \times(v_{s}^{\mathrm{model\ 1}}/v_{s}^{\mathrm{model\ 2}})\). Silvaco and Synopsis exclusively use extensions based on velocity; alternative models in terms of \(E_{c}\) are also listed below. There are generally three parameterizations for the high field behavior, and for each parameterization there are multiple choices for the parameters themselves. First are the three parameterizations:

Footnote 5: A typical field value at full depletion for planar sensors is \(4kV/\mathrm{cm}\) and can be up to an order of magnitude larger for irradiated sensors.

1. **Extended Thomas**[14]. The original result used \(E/E_{c}\) as in Eq. 18, but since that time, results based on \(\mu_{0}E/v_{s}\) as in Eq. 19 are also common. \[\mu(T,E)=\mu_{0}(T)\left[1+\left(\frac{E}{E_{c}(T)}\right)^{\beta}\right]^{-1 /\beta}\] (18) \[\mu(T,E)=\mu_{0}(T)\left[1+\left(\frac{\mu_{0}(T)E}{v_{s}(T)} \right)^{\beta}\right]^{-1/\beta}\] (19)2. **Hansch**[30]. A theoretical analysis is performed to derive a field-dependent carrier mobility that includes temperature effects. Once again, the extrapolation could use the critical electric field instead of \(v_{s}\), but Eq. 20 uses the velocity as it is more commonly used (was also used in the original paper). \[\mu(T,E)=2\mu_{0}(T)\left[1+\left(1+\left(\frac{2\mu_{0}(T)E}{v_{s}(T)}\right)^ {\beta}\right)^{1/\beta}\right]^{-1}\] (20)
3. **Hamburg-Trofimenkoff**[28, 29, 31]. The model was particularly tailored for high fields, \(E>2.4\) kV/cm. Different parameterizations are given for electrons (Eq. 21) and holes (Eq. 22). \[\mu_{e}(T,E) =\left[1/\mu_{e,0}+E/v_{s}\right]^{-1}\] (21) \[\mu_{h}(T,E) =\begin{cases}\mu_{h,0}&E<E_{0}\\ \left[1/\mu_{0,h}+b(E-E_{0})+c(E-E_{0})^{2}\right]^{-1}&E\geq E_{0}\end{cases}\] (22)

Table 2 shows the parameters proposed in the literature for the above high field models. In principle, any one of the low-field models can be matched with any of the high-field models resulting in 70 total models. Note that not all of the model combinations are sensible - for example, the Extended Hamburg-Trofimenkoff model was optimized using the Hamburg-Trofimenkoff low field mobility; any other low field mobility will result in a sub-optimal model. In addition, matching the typo-corrected Canali model with the Jacoboni-Canali saturation velocity with a typo has never been and will likely never be used. This will be an important consideration when selecting the models after studying their predictions for the ATLAS pixel detector in Sec. 3. The \(\beta\) values for the extended Hamburg model have been measured for both the \(\langle 100\rangle\) and \(\langle 111\rangle\) lattice orientations. Values for the \(\langle 100\rangle\) orientation are reported in Table 2.

## 3 Simulation Results

Using the various models presented in the previous section, Fig. 2 displays the electron and hole mobility predicted for an ATLAS IBL (200 microns thick) with an applied bias voltage of 80 V at -4\({}^{\circ}\) C. The relative change in the mobility (and thus also the Lorentz angle) is shown in Fig. 3. For electrons, nearly all predictions are below the default ATLAS Run 1 model. This is expected, as its value was erroneously high by over 6% as noted earlier. In contrast, the values for holes tend to be higher than the nominal, though most values are within a few percent of the nominal. The corrected default (Canali + Extended Canali) predicts a 6% decrease in the electron mobility with no change in the hole mobility. The most recent prediction with the \(\langle 111\rangle\) lattice orientation (Hamburg + Extended Hamburg \(\langle 111\rangle\)) calls for a 7% decrease in the electron mobility and a 9% decrease in the hole mobility.

The ATLAS Run 1 default is shown in the bottom left corner. See the text (Sec. 2) for details about the various low and high field mobility models.

## 4 Comparison with Collision Data

To avoid complications from radiation damage, the simulations are compared with data from 2015, early in Run 2 when the IBL was new. Figure 4 shows the average transverse cluster size in \(Z\to\mu\mu\) events as a function of the track incidence angle. The angle at the minimum cluster size is the Lorentz angle (about 0.26 rad). Predictions with various mobility models are compared with the data. Even though a large number of models were studied in earlier sections, only three models are considered here in order to focus on the most relevant models: the current ATLAS default (Jacoboni-Canali (low field), Extended Jacoboni-Canali (high field)) without an ad-hoc 10% correction applied, the same model but with the typo corrected (Canali / Extended-Canali), and the recent Hamburg-Thomas / Extended Hamburg model with the \(\langle 111\rangle\) lattice orientation parameters. The Canali / Extended-Canali and Hamburg models provide an accurate description of the data as the difference with data is nearly flat in the lower panel of Fig. 4, indicating that it correctly predicts the Lorentz angle. Since the Canali / Extended-Canali also does not change the hole mobility (not constrained by 2015 pixel data), it will become the default simulation during the shutdown between Runs 2 and 3.

The predictions for various mobility models are shown with colored markers. The first model name is the low-field model and the second model name is the high-field model.

## 5 Conclusions and Outlook

This note has presented a review of silicon mobility models and compared several common or recent ones with Lorentz angle data from the ATLAS pixel detector collected during the LHC Run 2. The ad-hoc 90% scaling factor from Run 1 can be largely explained by the choice of model and has been replaced with a new model for the rest of Run 2 and beyond. The importance of mobility modeling for charge collection in the ATLAS pixel detector will only increase with time due to radiation damage. The sensors will be operated at high bias (\(\approx 5\) V/\(\mu\)m) with a non-trivial electric field profile due to defects in the silicon lattice that also lead to charge trapping. The mobility will determine if electrons and holes travel fast enough to be trapped and otherwise determine their location at trap. Therefore, the results presented here are a critical step to a complete model for the current and future life of the pixel detectors.
