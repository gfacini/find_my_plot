[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]

For B-physics studies, the LVL1 trigger will be an inclusive muon trigger with a \(p_{T}\) threshold of 6 GeV. Requiring at least one muon with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV in an event leads to the following composition of the accepted events after LVL1: 30% are events with a decay of b-quark to a muon, \(\sim 16\%\) of events contain muon from charm decays and the rest are due to \(K/\pi\rightarrow\mu\nu\) decays. At low transverse momenta (\(p_{T}<8\) GeV) muons originating from \(\pi\) and \(K\) decays in flight dominate over all other sources. The task of the LVL2 muon trigger is to reduce the fraction of muons from \(\pi\) and \(K\) decays. At LVL2, the muon trigger is able to identify muons and define the track parameters more precisely than at LVL1. However this is not enough to reject all background muons. Extrapolation of muon track to the Inner Detector and comparison of it's parameters with those reconstructed in the Inner Detector gives a possibility to reduce the trigger rate by requiring a good match. A muon originating from a \(\pi/K\) decay has a lower momentum measured in the muon detector than the original meson detected in the Inner Detector. In addition, a kink could be observed when trying to combine the track segment in the ID and muon detector. This will lead to an increased of \(\chi^{2}\) for the combined track. However, the multiple scattering and energy loss fluctuations (for example in the calorimeters) dilutes this effect.

The possibility of rejecting the muons originating from \(\pi\) and \(K\) decays has been investigated using offline tools, xKalman for the reconstruction in the Inner Detector (ID) and MuonBox for the reconstruction in the Muon Spectrometer (MS). Promising results were obtained by using the method of statistical combination (STACO) of the two segments of muon track from ID amd MS. The procedure STACO is described in detail in the [3]. It was shown that only 10-15 % of muons from \(K\) decays and 30-50% of muons from \(\pi\) decays are misidentified as prompt muons at the 90% efficiency for the prompt muons in the \(p_{T}\) range 6-10 GeV.

At LVL2, the expected resolutions for the track parameters are worse compared to offline. This leads to a decrease in the rejection power of the \(\chi^{2}\) cut. Also, at LVL2 the full track information including co-variance matrix may not be available. The question is whether it would be possible to reject non-interesting muons using a simplified STACO procedure. To investigate this, the single muon studies were performed and compared to results obtained with \(\overline{b}b\rightarrow\mu X\) samples and minimum bias events with non-prompt muons.

## 1 Single muon studies.

An investigation of the non-prompt single muon rejection was performed using samples of muons with fixed \(p_{T}\) between 6 and 12 GeV in \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|<2.5\). The decays of \(\pi/K\) were limited to the radius 1.40 m. The reconstruction of tracks in Muon Spectrometer and Inner Detector was performed using offline tools, MuonBoX and xKalman. The resolutions obtained with offline code were compared to the resolutions obtained with trigger code both for the ID and MS. The expected resolutions at LVL2 (after the reconstruction in the SCT and Pixels with Pixel+Si-Kalman code) are given in [2] These are approximately twice as large as those obtained with offline code. The same situation is seen in the Muon Spectrometer [1]. To get a realistic estimation of the reduction of non-prompt muons, a factor 2 was chosen to smear the quantities reconstructed by the offline tools, xKalman and MuonBox. These smeared values will be referred to as "trigger-like" measurements.

In Fig.1 the single muon resolutions in \(1/p_{T},\phi,\eta\) and \(z\) are shown, ID resolutions on the left and MS on the right. One can see that all measurements made by the ID are more precise than those made by MS. When combining the information from both the muon-spectrometer system and the Inner Detector, weighted by the errors, the dominant contribution will be from Inner Detector. At LVL2 a cut is made on the \(p_{T}\) measured by the MS. A value of \(p_{T,thr}^{MS}=4.2\) GeV is chosen to preserve a high reconstruction efficiency for prompt muons with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV. The role of muon LVL2 trigger is to identify muons and to provide a region of interest (ROI) to search for a corresponding track segment in the ID. The parameters of muon track \((p_{T},\phi,\eta,z)\) can be used to restrict the range of possible trajectories for an associated track in the ID.

The next step is a search for a track candidate segment in the ID within an ROI defined by the muon track. An ID track is considered for association to the as a muon candidate if it satisfies the

following cuts:

* Number of precision hits \(\geq\) 9
* Number of pixel hits \(\geq\) 2
* 1 associated hit in the B-layer
* Number of TRT hits \(\geq\) 20
* \(p_{T}^{ID}>\) 5.5 GeV

The efficiencies to pass these selection criteria for the prompt muons and for muons from \(\pi/K\) decays are shown in the [3] as functions of \(p_{T}\). For example, efficiency to pass the ID selection cuts is around 95% for the promt muons with \(p_{T}\) = 8 GeV,\(\sim\) 85% for muons originated from pions with \(p_{T}\) = 8 GeV and \(\sim\) 45% for muons originated from kaons with \(p_{T}\) = 8 GeV. After a track candidate has been found in the ID, it is considered for merging with the track segment from the MS. Matching between the ID and MS track segments can be made by using the variable R defined as:

\[R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta p_{T})^{2}}, \tag{1}\]

where

\[\Delta\eta=\eta_{\mu}^{MS}-\eta_{\mu}^{ID}, \tag{2}\]

is the difference between measured \(\eta\)'s in the MS and ID,

\[\Delta\phi=\phi_{\mu}^{MS}-\phi_{\mu}^{ID} \tag{3}\]

is the difference between measured \(\phi\)'s in the MS and ID, and

\[\Delta p_{T}=(p_{T\mu}^{MS}-p_{T\mu}^{ID})/p_{T\mu}^{ID}, \tag{4}\]

is the normalized difference between the measured \(p_{T}\)'s in the MS and ID.

One can expect that the cone size, R, will be defined mostly by the MS errors, as the MS measurements have much larger errors.

The dependence of the cone size, R, on the accuracy of measurements is demonstrated in Fig 2. In the Fig.2(a,b), the R-distributions are plotted for 6 GeV prompt muons and for muons from 10 GeV pions respectively for the "ideal" case when all the measurements and corresponding resolutions are the offline ones. One can see that R-distribution is much wider for the non-prompt muons, reflecting the change of trajectory and hence the \(p_{T}\), \(\phi\), and \(\eta\) due to the kink between the \(\pi\)-track and daughter \(\mu\)-track. In the subfigures Fig(c,d), R is shown for the case when measurements in the MS are offline measurements and measurements in the ID are "trigger-like" measurements. Again, there is a big difference between R for the prompt muons and for the non-prompt muons. The next two subfigures, Fig.2(e,f) show the R-distributions for the trigger-like resolutions in Muon Spectrometer and offline resolutions in the Inner Detector. The R-distributions for the case when both measurements in MS and ID are trigger-like measurements are shown in the Fig.2(g,h). The width of R-distribution for the prompt 6 GeV muons becomes comparable with the width of the R-distribution for muons originating from 10 GeV pions. So, the rejection power of the matching requirements decreases strongly with increasing resolutions in MS.

It is known that in the MS the \(p_{T}\) resolution is much better for high-\(p_{T}\) muons. The interesting \(p_{T}\) region for the B-physics is 6-10 GeV. Figure 3 shows the R-distribution for 6 GeV (upper subfigure) and 10 GeV (bottom subfigure) prompt muons with trigger-like resolutions in the MS and ID. For 6 GeV muons the width of the distribution is approximately 1.5 times larger compared to that for 10 GeV muons. For the final performance measurements two different thresholds on R are chosen:Figure 2: R-distributions for single prompt muons with \(p_{T}=6\) GeV (left) and for muons originating from pions with \(p_{T}=10\) GeV (right). The R-distributions are plotted for the different values of the resolutions obtained in the MS and ID (see text).

* \(R<\) 0.5 for \(5.5<p_{T}^{ID}<\) 8 GeV
* \(R<\) 0.45 for \(p_{T}^{ID}>\) 8 GeV

A track from the ID is considered to match the MS track segment, if it satisfies the appropriate R cut shown above.

Finally, a "\(\chi^{2}\)" can be calculated for the combination of the reconstructed segments of the tracks from the ID. Using the only \(1/p_{T}\) measurements, one can define a "\(\chi^{2}\)" as follows:

\[\chi^{2}=\frac{1/p_{T}^{ID}-1/p_{T}^{MS}}{\sigma_{ID}^{2}+\sigma_{MS}^{2}}, \tag{5}\]

where \(\sigma_{ID}\) and \(\sigma_{MS}\) are the \(1/p_{T}\)-resolutions in ID and MS respectively. Only combinations with \(\chi^{2}<8\) are selected.

The selection described above was applied to the single muon samples with different \(p_{T}\)'s. The results obtained are summarized in Table 1. The second column shows the reconstruction efficiency in the MS. The third column shows the overall efficiency for the reconstruction of a muon track in the MS, the reconstruction of the track in ID and passing the selection cuts.

Rejection of 40%-60% of the muons originating from pions which decay in flight and 80%-87% of the muons originated from kaons can be achieved using the proposed method. The efficiency for the prompt muons varies with \(p_{T}\) from 84% for 6 GeV muons to 90% for 10 GeV muons.

## 2 Studies with \(\overline{b}b\) and minimum bias events.

The possibility of rejecting non-prompt muons at LVL2 whilst preserving a high efficiency for prompt muons was verified using samples with full events. The signal sample was \(\overline{b}b\to X\,\mu(p_{T}>\) 6 GeV) and the background sample was minimum bias events, in which the pions and kaons with \(p_{T}>\) 8 GeV were required to decay into \(\mu\nu\). Both samples are without pile-up. The results of the analysis are shown in the Table 2.

The definition of efficiency used for columns 2-3 is the same as in Table 1. The ID efficiency for muons which have been detected in the MS is given in the last column.

A reduction by factor 1.6 can be achieved for non-prompt muons originating from the decays of \(\pi/K\) with \(p_{T}>\) 8 GeV.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \hline Sample & MB Efficiency (\%) & MB+ID Efficiency (\%) \\ \hline \hline
10 GeV prompt \(\mu\) & 98 & 90 \\ \hline
6 GeV prompt \(\mu\) & 95 & 83.6 \\ \hline \hline \(\mu\) from 10 GeV \(\pi\) & 97 & 60 \\ \hline \(\mu\) from 8 GeV \(\pi\) & 94 & 59 \\ \hline \(\mu\) from 6 GeV \(\pi\) & 80 & 39 \\ \hline \hline \(\mu\) from 12 GeV \(K\) & 70 & 18 \\ \hline \(\mu\) from 8 GeV \(K\) & 58 & 17 \\ \hline \(\mu\) from 6 GeV \(K\) & 46 & 13 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

## 3 Conclusions

Using a simplified STACO method it would be possible to reduce the muon rate from pions and kaons decaying in flight by a factor of 1.5-1.6 at LVL2. The applied cuts give an efficiency \(\sim 88\) % for muons from b-quarks which have been detected by muon spectrometer.
