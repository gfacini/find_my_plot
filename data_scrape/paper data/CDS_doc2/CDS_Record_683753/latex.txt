###### Abstract

This note describes the requirements for the cold cables of the ATLAS EM calorimeters and describes how the different parameters can be measured and to which precision. The results of the measurements performed on the cables produced for the module 0 are also discussed.

## 1 Specifications

### Mechanical tolerances

#### 1.1.1 Cable lengths, size, and connectors

Cold cables are meant to bring signals in and out from detector motherboards to the cold flange of the feedthroughs, inside the cryostats.

For the reasons discussed in [1] it was decided to have two types of cold cables depending on their nominal characteristics impedance: 25 \(\Omega\) and 50 \(\Omega\).

Calibration cables are all 50 \(\Omega\) (nominal impedance).

The cables are grouped in bundles of 64, named harnesses. Harnesses going from the detector to a support inside a cryostat, named patch panel, are named of A type and those going from the patch panel to the cold flange of the feedthrough are named of B type.

The harnesses are terminated at both ends by connectors: _low profile_ on the motherboards, eight per harness, \(\mu D\) on the patch panel, one per harness and _ATI_ at the cold flange of the feedthroughs, one per harness.

The different cable types and lengths are listed in a separate paper [2]. Specifications on cable size and connections can be found in [3]. Mechanical characteristics of chosen cables and connectors for module 0 are discussed in [6].

### Electrical tolerances

#### 1.2.1 Calibration cables

The most stringent constraints hold for the calibration cables.

Propagation timeTo keep the sensitivity of the energy resolution to the time jitter below 0.1%, the alignment between signal and calibration signal must be at most \(\pm\) 1 _ns_. For the longest cables (about 6 m) this implies

\[(\Delta t)_{max}<0.33\ ns/m \tag{1}\]

Due to the presence of programmable variable delay chips on the Front-End card, this constraint holds within each individual harness.

Characteristics impedanceTo keep the constant term contribution to the calorimeter energy resolution within acceptable limits (see [1]) it is mandatory to have at most 0.25 % r.m.s. on the calibration signal amplitude. Moreover, to avoid non gaussian tails in the energy response, the maximum dispersion on the calibration signal amplitude is required to be 1%.

Being the cable terminated in its nominal (50 \(\Omega\)) characteristic impedance at both ends, the sensitivity of the signal amplitude to any impedance mismatch is a second order function of the relative mismatch i.e.

\[\frac{\sigma_{s}}{s}=-\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{\sigma_{Z}}{Z_{0}}\right)^{2} \tag{2}\]

0.25% translates into

\[\frac{\sigma_{Z}}{Z_{0}}<10\%\qquad\quad(\sigma_{Z}<5\Omega) \tag{3}\]

This constraint holds for all calibration cables.

AttenuationAt the central frequency of the shaper bandwidth (about 10 Mhz) the attenuation coefficient \(\alpha\) is expected to be, assuming the parallel conductance to be negligible:

\[\alpha=\frac{R}{2Z_{0}} \tag{4}\]

At this high frequency theory predicts \(R\) to be dominated by the skin effect giving:

\[\alpha=\frac{\sqrt{\frac{\mu\nu}{\sigma\cdot\pi\nu}}(\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}) }{2\frac{1}{\epsilon_{0}\sqrt{\epsilon_{r}c2\pi}}ln\frac{b}{a}} \tag{5}\]

where \(\mu\) the magnetic permeability of the kapton, \(\epsilon_{r}\) is the relative dielectric permittivity of the kapton, \(\epsilon_{0}\) the relative dielectric permittivity of the vacuum, \(c\) the speed of light, \(a\) the inner conductor radius and \(b\) the outer conductor radius.

Then, for the longest cables (\(\sim 6m\)), the requirement of 0.25 % r.m.s. on the calibration signal amplitude gives the following constraints:

\[\sigma_{a}<11\mu\,m\qquad\quad\sigma_{b}<40\mu\,m\qquad\quad\frac{\sigma_{ \sqrt{\epsilon_{r}}}}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{r}}}<4.7\% \tag{6}\]where \(\alpha=0.85\%/m\), \(a=0.1\ mm\)[6] and \(b=0.6\ mm\)[6] have been assumed.

Again these constraints hold for all the cables.

These variations, according to theory, would correspond to a relative cable impedance spread of respectively \(6.5\%,4\%,4.7\%\). Requiring a maximum spread of \(4\%\), or \(2\ \Omega\), on the impedance measurements, allows then to keep the relevant cable parameters under control. A maximum dispersion of \(8\ \Omega\) is also required.

Changes in the eccentricity of the coaxial cable are effects of second order with respect to changes of dimensions [7].

A \(4.7\%\) spread in the dielectric constant would correspond also to a \(\sigma_{t}=0.28\ nsec/m\) and to a maximum dispersion of \((\Delta t)_{max}=1.12\ ns/m\), measured over all the cables.

#### 1.2.2 Signal cables

The uniformity constraints on signal cables are less stringent than for the calibration ones since the signal lines are calibrated. However impedance mismatches have to be minimised since reflections are frequency dependent and might distort the signal shape, compromising measurements which depend on pulse shape analysis such as digital filtering, determination of drift time etc.

### Pollution and radiation hardness tolerances

Results on cold cable irradiations with neutrons can be found in [5].

## 2 Measurement techniques: electrical measurements

### Propagation time and characteristics impedance

#### 2.1.1 Experimental setup

In view of the large quantity of harnesses to be measured an automatic test bench is mandatory. Its conception is described in this paragraph. The two parameters, propagation time and characteristics impedance, are extracted from the shape analysis of the same pulse. This has the advantage, compared to a scenario with two different test benches, of both money and time saving in the cable testing. The precision requirements which the test bench aims at are of \(\sigma_{t}\sim 50\) psec and \(\sigma_{Z}\sim 2\%\) as derived from section 1.2.1.

An exponential ATLAS-like calibration voltage signal (\(1\ ns\) risetime and \(400\ nsec\) fall time) was injected into the cables through a \(1\ K\Omega\) resistor (figure 1 a)-b)). The signal was then processed through an ATLAS like shaper, with \(50\ \Omega\) input impedance and displayed on a digital scope. The shaper time constant was set to \(\tau=5\ nsec\), smaller than the ATLAS one (\(\tau=15\ nsec\)). The reason for this choice comes from the impedance measurement and will be discussed later on.

The signal was injected into the 64 cables of a harness and read out using two cards, especially developed at LAL, making use of switchable op-amps to load and scan the different lines.

To adapt the test bench to both A and B-type harnesses, four (two for the 25 \(\Omega\) cables and two for the 50 \(\Omega\) cables) short connection harnesses of the complementary type where used, with a length of 50 cm.

The **propagation time** of the signal pulse inside the cable was measured as the time corresponding to the 5% amplitude on the output signal rising edge from the corresponding time giving the external trigger of the scope. This time included an offset due to the test bench (connection harness, connection cables, scanner card etc.): this offset, which is by the way of no relevance for the measurement of the time propagation spread within a harness, will be corrected for the measurement of the cable mass production.

While the test bench was mainly designed for the time measurement, the measurement of the transmitted signal amplitude provides a method to measure the cable **characteristics impedance**, since a reflection occurs in case of impedance mismatch between the characteristics impedance and the adaptation at the end of the cable.

The sensitivity \(f\) of the amplitude measurement to the cable impedance is defined as

\[\frac{\Delta A}{A}(\%)=f\cdot\frac{\Delta Z}{Z}(\%) \tag{7}\]

where \(A\) is the amplitude of the transmitted signal, \(Z\) the cable impedance. A simulation of the setup performed with SPICE (where transmission line elements are treated as ideal, i.e. without considering any resistive effect) showed that \(f\thicksim 0.5\) independent of cable length and of shaping time \(\tau\) when \(\tau<t_{l}\), where \(t_{l}\) is the time needed for the signal to travel across the cable. Given the cable lengths we have to measure [2], a shaping time of \(\tau=5\)_nsec_ was chosen.

Careful timing and amplitude corrections among the different lines were calculated and applied; the test bench was eventually calibrated before each set of measurements using it with the two connection harnesses in series. Then a residual uncertainty comes from the connection harness which is removed during the final measurement and it was measured to be \(\Delta t_{max}\thicksim 30\)_psec_.

A simulation was also performed with a different setup, with a current signal injected on a capacitance and then in the cable, as in the ATLAS calorimeter, with realistic capacitance values [1]. Values of \(f\) ranging from 0.4 to 0.15 were found, the lower capacitance giving the larger value, indicating that this alternative setup would be less sensitive to the cable impedance.

#### 2.1.2 Calibration of test bench and cross-checks

A few other measurements were performed on a reference harness (a B type of 4 m lenght), chosen as the one with the largest dispersion of measured parameters, to verify the correctness of the previous measurements and to get an absolute calibration of the methods. These measurements were performed in a non-automatic way (i.e. measuring the cables one by one) with two different setups: a) the capacitance with an impedance analyser (H4192A) and b) the time and the characteristics impedance with time domain reflectometry.

CapacitanceIn principle it should be possible to measure a few cable parameters with the impedance analyser. However, the frequencies of interest (around 10 MHz)are very close to the quarter-wavelenght, in particular for the longest cables, and most of the measurements become very imprecise.

The capacitance in stead, measured from the imaginary part of the open circuit impedance with sinusoidal waves, is predicted by theory [7] to be, below 1 Mhz, equal to the cable capacitance per unit length C and independent of resistive effects.

The constancy of the measured capacitance value as a function of frequency below about 1 Mhz was also experimentally observed (see figure 4).

The chosen frequency was 20 KhZ.

Time domain reflectometryThe set-up was as follows. The signal was injected directly into the oscilloscope, without using any injection-scanning card and the harness was put in parallel to the oscilloscope input (on the ATI connector side), leaving the other end open. For the propagation time measurement no shaping was used (figure 1 d)), while for the amplitude measurement the shaping time was set as above at \(\tau=5\)_nsec_ (figure 1 c)). The unshaped signal observed at the scope is shown in figure 2. The appearance of the first plateau at intermediate height corresponds to the signal pulse propagating back and forth inside the cable. Therefore one half the lenght of this plateau (taken for the sake of precision between the times corresponding to the 50% amplitude of the transition at each step) was taken as a measurement of the propagation time. The smoothened shape of the signal is due to pass-band limitation induced by frequency dependent resistive effects [7]. An independent measurement of these effects using the impedance analyser, and terminating the cable at both ends in its nominal characteristics impedance to get rid of first order reflections (see paragraph 1.2.1), confirmed this pass-band limitation to be effective for frequencies larger than 100 KHz and therefore well inside the shaper pass-band too. However, while this limitation has an influence on the signal pulse amplitude, the shaper transfer function in the frequency domain is much narrower than that of the cable and the maximum cable lenght is only 6 m. Therefore pulse shape distorsion during propagation is very limited.

The ratio between the amplitude of the first and the second plateau in figure 2 is expected [7] to be proportional to the ratio between the cable impedance and the terminating impedance. However, since theory predicts the cable impedance to have a significant frequency dependence, it was thought appropriate for the amplitude measurement to shape the signal with the same shaping time as above (\(\tau=5\)_nsec_).

A SPICE simulation of the setup was performed as for the transmission amplitude case and again a factor \(f=0.5\) was found. However to remove any dependence on theoretical assumptions, the reflected amplitude measurement could be calibrated in an absolute way by replacing the cable with resistors of values ranging from 45 to 60 \(\Omega\). Very good linearity was found with the measured signal amplitude and the slope obtained was \(f=0.33\). The difference with respect to the theoretical prediction could be ascribed to both the cable impedance not being a real quantity and to its frequency dependence.

This calibration allows also to calibrate in an absolute way the transmission amplitude method, as will be discussed in the following section.

Comparison of the different methodsThe measurements of the propagation time were found to be very consistent with those obtained with the transmission measure ment as shown in fig 5. The linear fit gives a slope close to one and an offset for the transmission measurement of about 4 nsec. The r.m.s. on the time measurment turns out to be, assuming the two measurements contribute the same and have uncorrelated errors, about 35 psec, of the same order of the estimated uncertainty in section 2.1.1.

For the measurements of the cables of the mass production it is foreseen to use the reflectometry measurement to calibrate the offset of the test bench to zero.

From theory [7] it can be shown that, for the ideal cable, the different parameters \(t_{d},Z,C\) are not independent. Indeed

\[\frac{t_{d}}{C}=Z \tag{8}\]

In figure 6 a) the ratio of propagation time and capacitance vs. characteristic impedance as obtained by time domain reflectometry after calibration with discrete resistors is shown. A linear fit gives a slope of 0.85 with an offset of 4 \(\Omega\), which can both be explained by the frequency dependence of the cable impedance, and the fact that \(\frac{t_{d}}{C}\) correspond to a higher frequency impedance measurement. The uncertainty on the impedance measurement (assuming both measurement to contribute the same) is 0.2 \(\Omega\). The rather good correlation observed between the two quantities gives a strong indication for a correct impedance measurement with time domain reflectometry.

In figure 6 b) the transmitted relative pulse amplitude vs. the (absolutely calibrated) relative characteristic impedance is shown. A linear fit gives again a slope of \(f=0.33\), indicating, as expected, that the correlation between the two (uncalibrated) amplitudes has a slope close to one. Being the uncertainty on the impedance known from the previous plot, the uncertainty on the transmitted amplitude can be derived to be 0.5% or 1.5% on Z. The contribution to the uncertainty coming from the different attenuations of the cables will be discussed further down and turns out to be 0.13% and therefore of little influence on the impedance measurement.

Further work is under way on the test bench to reduce the systematic uncertainties associated to the transmitted pulse amplitude for the measurements of the mass production.

The measurements were also repeated at liquid nitrogen temperature and it was found that the propagation time decreases by 3.3% and that the impedance increases by the same amount, both in agreement with a hypotesis of a variation of the dielectric constant with temperature. No effect on the spread among the values in a harness was found.

### Attenuation

Firstly, the validity of formula 2 was verified using a setup similar to that of figure 1 b, with the scanner and the injection cards removed and the harness replaced by one single 4 m 50 \(\Omega\) coaxial cable. The cable was terminated at the beginning and at the end with resistors of equal value, varied in the range \(50\pm 12\)\(\Omega\). Figure 7 shows the result of the measurement, indicating good agreement with the theory.

The setup to measure the attenuation spread in a harness, shown in figure 9, consisted of a calibration card [8] injecting, one channel at a time, the signal into a warm cable, followed by a pin carrier, the 4 m long 50 \(\Omega\) B harness used for the measurementsdiscussed above, a scanner card, the shaper, with \(\tau\) set to 15 nsec, and the scope. This setup was designed to reproduce as much as possible the cabling structure in the ATLAS calorimeter. The output impedance of the calibration board is 50 \(\Omega\) and the input impedance of the scanner card is 50 \(\Omega\), satisfying the requirement of termination at both ends in the characteristics impedance to avoid the first order effect of the amplitude loss. The uniformity of the signal amplitude from the calibration board was measured to be 0.16% [8]. To reduce the influence of the other elements of the test bench in the attenuation measurement, the bench was calibrated with the B type 50 \(\Omega\) connection harness mentioned before.

The results of this measurements are shown in figure 8 where the transmitted pulse amplitude (relative to the mean) vs. the cable characteristics impedance is shown. There is no correlation between the two variables and the r.m.s. of the amplitude distribution is 0.13%.

Measurements performed with the impedance analyser at liquid nitrogen temperature showed at 10 Mhz a reduction of the attenuation of a factor 2 with respect to room temperature.

### Cross-talk

Due to the coaxial nature of the cables, this measurement was mainly conceived to test the cross-talk level inside the connectors. Therefore it was performed on one harness only.

The setup is the same as above, except for \(\tau\) which was set to 25 nsec to reproduce the peaking time used in the calorimeter of \(t_{p}=40\) nsec.

Figure 10 a) shows the **peak of cross-talk**(%), i.e. the maximum signal amplitude of the induced signal in a channel normalised to the peak amplitude in the channel where the signal was injected. Figure 10 b) shows the **cross-talk at the peak**(%), i.e. the signal amplitude of the induced signal in a channel at the time corresponding to the peak amplitude in the channel where the signal was injected, normalised to this last peak amplitude.

Figure 11, in the upper row (continuous line) shows the signal shapes of one channel where the signal was injected and a of a few adjacent ones.

The cross-talk appears to be concentrated in the channels adjacent to the injection one assuming a maximum peak of cross-talk value of 0.7%. It is well differentiated and of opposite polarity of the signal.

There is no long distance cross-talk (\(<0.005\%\)). The small increase at multiples of 16 channels (\(<0.1\%\)) is due to the \(\mu D\) connector.

A deterioration of the cross-talk is clearly visible on the even channels going towards channel 64. This can be attributed to a ground repair of the warm cable, 0.6 mm away from the signal leads, and thus sligthly inductive.

### Shielding efficiency

Results of measurements performed by the cable provider can be found in [6].

Measurements of the cables produced for the module 0

### Introduction

Results of measurements on cold cables for the module 0 will be separately presented for the 25 \(\Omega\) cables and the 50 \(\Omega\) ones.

Towards the end of cable production for the module 0 the dielectric was changed, from HKJ kapton, produced with a layer of polymide glue onto it, to standard kapton. Some harnesses were produced with the new material and led to an improved quality in terms of uniformity of electrical properties. Since this material is proposed to be retained for the final production, results will also be shown separately for the old and the new cable type.

The e.m. calorimeters module zeros, not including presampler, are equipped with 264 harnesses of 64 cables each.

All the harnesses were measured in our lab. However the first 62 were measured with a preliminary version of the setup described in the previous sections and will not be discussed here. Moreover, since no 25 \(\Omega\) cables with the new dielectric were available for module 0, this paper includes measurements on 9 harnesses of this kind produced by the same company for test purposes.

### Results

Figures 12 and 13 summarise the results of the different measurement s:

* the propagation time (an offset is present due to signal propagation in the connection harness etc.) vs. cable length. Harnesses with cables of different length are represented in blue, while harnesses having all the cables with same length are represented in red (when with the new dielectric) and in green (when with the old dielectric). The correlation between time and length is linear, which indicates the correctness of the time measurement. The slope gives the speed of propagation, about 6 nsec/m. Different intercepts at zero length can be observed for the different groups,in particular for the 25 \(\Omega\) cables, and can be traced to uncorrected offsets in the experimental setup. For the ATLAS mass production an effort will be made to reduce these offset in order to measure the time dispersion over all the cables.
* the maximum time dispersion within a harness.
* the measured amplitude (in arbitrary units) vs. cable length. The value of 1 has been arbitrarily chosen. Again the correlation is linear. The mean attenuations extracted from the plots are \(\alpha=4.5\%/m\) for the 25 \(\Omega\) cables and \(\alpha=3.0\%/m\) for the 50 \(\Omega\) ones. These values are in agreement with attenuation measurement performed with the impedance analyser with cable termination at both ends in its characteristics impedance. Given the fast shaping time (\(\tau=5~{}nsec\)) of the signal used for these measurements, the above measured attenuations correspond to \(\alpha=1.7\%/m\) for the 50 \(\Omega\) cables and \(\alpha=2.6\%/m\) for the 25 \(\Omega\) ones with the ATLAS shaping time (\(\tau=15\;nsec\)) at \(300^{o}\) K. In turn these value correspond to \(\alpha=0.85\%/m\) for the 50 \(\Omega\) cables and \(\alpha=1.3\%/m\) for the 25 \(\Omega\) ones at \(77^{o}\) K.
* d) the impedance of all cables. It is obtained from the amplitude measurement, after correcting for the measured mean attenuation (see above c). An absolute calibration was performed by measuring a few cables per type also with the reflection method, which can be directly calibrated using discrete resistors.

The results of the measurements are summarised in table 1.

The comparison between cables produced with the new and the old dielectric is presented in table 2. It should be remembered that the precision on the time measurement is of the order \(\sigma_{t}\sim 50\;psec\) and that on the impedance of \(1\%\).
