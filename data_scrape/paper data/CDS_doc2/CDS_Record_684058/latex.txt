**Abstract**

This note summarizes the physics requirements for the Higher Level Trigger of the ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition system. Based on the recent 'ATLAS detector and physics performance' TDR, an overview of basic selection criteria for the various physics processes to be studied by ATLAS is given. From this information, a physics (trigger) menu is constructed, which will serve as a basis for a HLT menu.

Introduction

This note summarizes the physics requirements for the Higher Level Trigger (HLT) of the ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition system. Based on the recent 'ATLAS detector and physics performance' TDR, an overview of basic selection criteria for the various physics processes to be studied by ATLAS is given. From this information, a physics (trigger) menu is constructed, which will serve as a basis for a HLT menu.

The note is structured as follows: the next section contains a proposed classification for the physics event selection at low luminosity, followed by a similar section for the case of high luminosity. Based on these classifications, the next section contains a physics trigger menu to be used at the HLT. The appendix contains a section with a summary of the present trigger menus for LVL1 and LVL2, both for the case of low and high luminosities. Next an overview of the variety of physics channels considered in the 'ATLAS detector and physics performance' TDR is presented, with more detailed selection criteria listed and the coverage of the present LVL1 and LVL2 menus being discussed. Then a discussion on prescaled and redundant triggers is provided. Finally, the results of existing studies using offline reconstruction are summarized, which can be used as prototype selections for the EF.

## 2 Physics event selection classification at low luminosity running

The classification criteria for the various physics classes described in this section have been derived from the list of selection cuts listed in the appendix.

TBD: add some comments on the selections made, explain motivation, use of only 'obvious' and simple objects, no detailed cuts,...

### Qcd

The threshold given in the following tables should be taken as an indication, the absolute values needed to be derived correctly, the same holds for the prescale factors.

Not yet included in this menu are items related to the selection of minimum bias event and events related to hard diffractive scattering, as well as studies of heavy quark production and Drell-Yan processes, leading to lepton pairs.

### Electroweak physics

In this part, the classification for electroweak measurements is listed. Two main issues are addressed: the measurement of the \(W\) mass and the measurement of triple gauge boson couplings using \(WZ\) and \(W\gamma\) final states.

### Top physics

The following table contains the selection criteria found for measurements of properties of the top quark (mass, branching ratios and couplings, spin correlations and search for 

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

from the on average 23 minimum bias per bunch crossing, the thresholds for the various selections have to be raised.

TBD: at the moment, these are essentially copy and paste results: NEEDS more effort and thinking!!!

### Qcd

The threshold given in the following tables should be taken as an indication, the absolute values needed to be derived correctly, the same holds for the prescale factors.

### Top physics

### B-physics

At high luminosity, the \(B\)-physics menu only contains items related to rare \(B\) decays.

#### 3.3.1 Standard Model Higgs

#### 3.3.2 MSSM Higgs

#### 3.4 Supersymmetry

This section proposes a compact HLT trigger menu, which covers all the channels and selections discussed in the previous chapter.

The aim of the HLT is to reduce the rate of LVL1 selected events of about 75 kHz (maximum 100 kHz) to an order of 100 Hz (or more precisely to a bandwidth used of 100 MByte/s) going to mass storage. The aim is to be as inclusive as possible, in order not to miss a new signature from the very beginning.

TBD fill in rates, S:B ratios, add uncertainties on rates where known CHECK whether coverage is complete!!

WARNING: the following tables are a proposal for discussion, for some items the thresholds might have to be changed!!!

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline selection & comment \\ \hline \hline \(e25i+E_{T}^{miss}25\) & \(W\) mass measurement \\ \hline \(\mu 25i+E_{T}^{miss}25\) & \(W\) mass measurement \\ \hline \(\gamma 100i+e40i\) & \(W\gamma\) production \\ \hline \((e25i)^{3}\) & \(WZ\) production \\ \hline \((e25i)^{2}+\mu 25i\) & \(WZ\) production \\ \hline \((\mu 25i)^{2}+e25i\) & \(WZ\) production \\ \hline \((\mu 25i)^{3}\) & \(WZ\) production \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Appendix A Present LVL1 and LVL2 trigger menus

This section contains a summary of the present assumptions on the LVL1 and LVL2 trigger menus, as documented e.g. in the TPSR [2]. The composition of the trigger menus in terms of the trigger items is shown for the scenarios of low (\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) and high luminosity (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)).

### Low luminosity scenario

In case of low luminosity, the selection at LVL2 includes criteria for accepting B-physics events, based on an unguided search for low momentum tracks in the Inner Detector. The LVL1 selection for this event class is based on an inclusive muon signature (with low transverse momentum) from the semi-leptonic decay of a \(b\) quark.

#### a.1.1 LVL1, low and high \(p_{T}\) part

Table A.1.1 shows the trigger menu for LVL1 in the case of low luminosity. The total rate at LVL1 in case of low luminosity is dominated by the inclusive muon trigger with 6 GeV nominal threshold, which is needed for the selection of B-physics events and contributes to 50 % of the total rate. About 25 % of the rate are due to the inclusive trigger on an electromagnetic high \(p_{T}\) signature (i.e. an electron or a photon) with a nominal threshold of 20 GeV.

#### a.1.2 LVL2, high \(p_{T}\) part

In table A.1.2 the trigger menu for the high \(p_{T}\) part (i.e. excluding B-physics) is shown for the case of low luminosity. After the LVL2 selection, the total rate (for high \(p_{T}\)) is dominated by the item \(\tau 20+xE30\), contributing about 30 %. The next two largest contributions come from \(j50+xE50\) and the inclusive single muon trigger \(\mu 20\), each giving \(\approx 15-20\) % of the total rate. Less than 10 % each are used by the triggers on inclusive electrons (\(e20i\)) and photons (\(\gamma 40i\)) as well as inclusive jets (\(j180\)).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l||l|c|} \hline
1. & \(\mu 6\) & 23 kHz \\ \hline
2. & \(em20i\) & 11 kHz \\ \hline
3. & \((em15i)^{2}\) & 2 kHz \\ \hline
4. & \(j180\) & 0.2 kHz \\ \hline
5. & \((j75)^{3}\) & 0.2 kHz \\ \hline
6. & \((j55)^{4}\) & 0.2 kHz \\ \hline
7. & \(j50+xE50\) & 0.4 kHz \\ \hline
8. & \(\tau 20+xE30\) & 2 kHz \\ \hline
9. & others & 5 kHz \\ \hline \hline  & total & 44 kHz \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 18: Trigger menu and rates at LVL1 for the low luminosity scenario

#### a.1.3 LVL2, low \(p_{T}\) part

The trigger menu for B-physics at LVL2 is shown in table A.1.3. The total rate is dominated by the trigger on \(J/\Psi\), decaying to two electrons, which amounts to about 30 %. The next two largest contributions come from the trigger for \(B_{s}\) (\(\mu 6+(h1.5)^{3}+m_{\phi}+m_{D_{s}}\)) and for inclusive \(J/\Psi\) decaying to two muons (\(\mu 6+\mu 5\)), which give about \(15-20\) % each.

### High luminosity scenario

For the high luminosity scenario, only selections (at LVL2) based on the RoI guidance by LVL1 are used. No selection of B-physics events (based on an unguided track search) is included, except for the case of rare B hadron decays, which are'self-triggering' with a final state containing two muons.

#### a.2.1 Lvl1

Table A.2.1 shows the trigger menu for LVL1 in the case of high luminosity. The total rate at LVL1 in case of high luminosity is dominated by the inclusive electromagnetic trigger

Table 20: Trigger menu and rates at LVL2 for the low luminosity scenario, showing the items related to B-physics (‘low \(p_{T}\)’)with a 30 GeV nominal threshold, which is needed for the selection of events containing electrons or photons. It contributes to a bit more than 50 % of the total rate. The next largest contribution is due to the trigger on two electromagnetic clusters with a threshold of 20 GeV each, giving a fraction of about 12 % of the rate. About 10 % of the rate are due to the inclusive trigger on a high \(p_{T}\) muon signature with a nominal threshold of 20 GeV. All other items have relative rates of less than 3 %.

## Appendix B Physics processes, event selection criteria and expected rates

In the following subsections, an overview of the basic selection criteria for the various channels to be studied in the areas of QCD, electroweak physics, heavy quark and B-physics as well as for Higgs boson, supersymmetry and other searches is presented.

The various channels and the main selections (like \(p_{T}\), isolation, \(\eta\) range, invariant mass cuts and use of vertexing) have been extracted from the recent 'Detector and Physics Performance' TDR [3] for ATLAS.

### Summary of physics channels not (or not completely) covered by the present LVL1 and LVL2 menus

Existing studies on offline selections The following list of physics channels summarises the cases found which are listed in the Physics TDR, but are not (or only partially) covered by the present LVL1 and LVL2 trigger menu, as described in the same document. This part is restricted to the case of low luminosity, in case of high luminosity there are more channels, where the thresholds are higher at the trigger than in the analysis documented. Most of these analyses however have only been studied for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), i.e. low luminosity running.

**top, hadronic mode (18.1.2.3)**

* selection cuts: 1. \(\geq 6\) jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV, \(|\eta|<3\) 2. \(\geq 2\) of these jets being b-tagged, \(|\eta|<2.5\) 3. \(\sum E_{T}(jet)>200\) GeV The all hadronic mode for top decays will not be selected either at LVL1 or at LVL2, as the four jet trigger threshold is much higher (\((j55)^{4}\)) than used in the analysis. If \(b\)-tagging were available at LVL2, a lower threshold for the four jet trigger could possibly applied at LVL1 and the \(b\)-tagging at LVL2 would keep the rate essentially unchanged (STATED IN PHYSICS TDR).
**Yukawa coupling \(y_{t}\) (18.1.5.3)**

* selection cuts: 1. 1 isolated lepton (\(l=e,\mu\)), \(|\eta|<2.5\), \(p_{T}>20\) GeV (\(e\)) resp. 6 GeV (\(\mu\)) (in case of high luminosity: 30 GeV resp. 20 GeV) 2. missing \(E_{T}>xxx\) GeV 3. 6 jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV (30 GeV at high luminosity) 4. 4 of these as b-tagged
* CHECK CUTS!! In case of the muonics \(W\) decay mode for this channel, the requirement of a \(\mu 6\) will not survive LVL2 cuts, as \(\mu 6\) is only used for \(B\)-physics and the inclusive muon is \(\mu 20\). This channel could be saved by adding a requirement on jets or on missing \(E_{T}\), but it remains to be seen which thresholds could be achieved.

\(t\to g+q\) **via search for \(tt(\bar{t}t)\) production (18.1.5.4)**

This channel could be saved by adding a requirement on jets, but it remains to be seen which thresholds could be achieved.

* 2. 2 b-tagged jets, \(|\eta|<2.5\), \(p_{T}>30-50,30\) GeV This mode will not be selected either at LVL1 or at LVL2, as the four jet trigger threshold is much higher (\((j55)^{4}\)) than used in the analysis. If \(b\)-tagging were available at LVL2, a lower threshold for the four jet trigger could possibly applied at LVL1 and the \(b\)-tagging at LVL2 would keep the rate essentially unchanged (STATED IN PHYSICS TDR).

This channel could be saved by adding a requirement on jets, but it remains to be seen which thresholds could be achieved.
In summary, three classes of selection criteria can be distinguished, which are listed below in order of decreasing importance:

\(b\)**-jet tagging**: Several analyses could profit from having lower thresholds for multi-jet final states (top, hadronic mode, \(b\bar{b}H/A\) with \(H/A\to b\bar{b}\), \(H\to hh\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\)), this can however only be achieved by applying \(b\)-jet tagging already at LVL2. \(\mu 6\)**selection**: In several cases ( Yukawa coupling \(y_{t}\), \(t\bar{t}H\) with \(H\to b\bar{b}\), \(H/A\to t\bar{t}\to W(l\nu)W(jj)b\bar{b}\), \(H^{\pm}\to c\bar{s}\), \(H^{\pm}\to\bar{t}b\)), the physics analyses assumed a 6 GeV threshold for a muon at low luminosity. It should be evaluated, what the loss in significance would be if the muon threshold were to be raised to 20 GeV (in any case, the electron channel is unaffected). An alternative possibility would be to included additional conditions in conjunction with the \(\mu 6\) selection in order to keep the low threshold if deemed necessary. \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) Future studies could be done to determine the additional rate due to the inclusion of this channel, which would extend the reach for the measurement of \(B_{s}\) oscillations.

## Appendix C Pre-scaled and redundant triggers

This section discusses the possible usage of redundant triggers for the determination of trigger efficiencies from data alone, and of prescaled triggers, which can e.g. extend the measurement of inclusive jet cross-sections to lower thresholds.

TBD: expand this part, mention the motivation etc.

### Prescaled triggers and lowest thresholds desirable

### Determination of trigger efficiencies from data

## Appendix D Existing studies on offline selections

This section summarizes existing studies using offline software which give estimates of rates for inclusive selections, which might be used at the EF. It should be noted that no attempt is made here (and has been made yet in existing studies) to quantify the impact of not final calibration, misalignment and so on for the achievable rate reductions.

### Electron signatures

A study on the additional rejection to be obtained by making use of the offline calorimeter and Inner Detector reconstruction for the identification of electrons [4] has shown, that an additional rejection factor of 11.4 (resp. 9.5) w.r.t. the LVL2 selection can be obtained for low (resp. high) luminosity. The offline cuts include calorimeter shower shape criteria, tracking selection and matching the cluster to a track. This would lead to a rate (due to background from jets faking an electron signature) for an inclusive electron selection of 9 (63) Hz at low (high) luminosity, where the minimum \(p_{T}\) is 20 (30) GeV. By making use of the transition radiation in the TRT, a further reduction of \(>3.5\) (\(>1.3\)) can be obtained. The resulting rate is acceptable in the case of low luminosity and in the right order of magnitude for high luminosity.

The expected rate from \(W\to e\nu\) is 50 Hz [1] at design luminosity for \(p_{T}(e)>30\) GeV and \(E_{T}^{miss}>25\) GeV. Requiring in addition two jets two be produced together with the \(W\) with \(E_{T}(jet)>30\) GeV each, leads to a rate of only a few Hz. This selection covers the associated Higgs production in \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(WH\) (for \(W\to ev\) and \(H\to b\bar{b}\)). For the case of \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) (\(l=e,\mu\)) the signal rate at design luminosity is about 10 Hz [1].

### Photon signatures

For an inclusive photon selection, studies performed in the context of optimising the photon identification and jet rejection for the case of \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\)[5] have shown, that w.r.t. to LVL2 an additional rejection of 5.3 (2.6) for low (high luminosity) can be obtained. This would lead to an inclusive photon rate (due to background from jets faking a photon signature), with \(p_{T}>40(60)\) GeV, of 24 (166) Hz at low (high) luminosity. Once again, the rate for low luminosity is acceptable, the one for high luminosity should be further reduced (at least a factor 2 - 3).

The rate for a di-photon final state with the cuts \(p_{T}(\gamma)>20\) GeV and \(m_{\gamma\gamma}>60\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) amounts to a few Hz [1].

### Jet signatures

No studies have been performed on the expected rates for inclusive jet production (single, three or four jets) after an EF selection. W.r.t. a LVL2 selection based on a CONE algorithm however only a small additional reduction in the rate is expected due to the better calibration available at the EF. This is directly related to the fact that jets are the signal (and no easy separation of background is possible without studying the overall event topology). The presently assumed LVL2 output rate for the three items related to jets amounts to 220 Hz at low and to 280 Hz at high luminosity, which clearly exceeds the aim of 100 Hz total output after the EF.

### Tau signatures

### \(E_{t}^{miss}\) signatures

### Muon signatures

At high luminosity, the expected rate for inclusive muon production from \(W\rightarrow\mu\nu_{\mu}\) is about 90 Hz for \(p_{T}(\mu)>20\) GeV alone, a similar size is expected for muons from \(c\)-quark decays. The rate for muons from \(b\) quark decays with \(p_{T}(\mu)>20\) GeV is about 250 Hz [6]. For both sources of muon from semi-leptonic heavy quark decays however, a significant reduction in the rate can be expected by demanding an isolation criteria.

For a di-muon signature with low thresholds (each muon \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV) the rate from semi-leptonic \(b\) decays dominates and contributes to about 50 Hz at low luminosity.

### B-physics

The following results are based on [7].

#### d.7.1 Inclusive muon rate

For the case of low luminosity, the expected rate for a muon with \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV is about 2 kHz from semi-leptonic \(b\)-decays and about 1 kHz from semi-leptonic \(c\)-quark decays.

#### d.7.2 Inclusive \(J/\Psi\) selection

The rate for an inclusive \(J/\Psi\to\mu\mu\) signal in a final state containing two muons with \(p_{T}(\mu_{1})>6\) GeV and \(p_{T}(\mu_{2})>5\) GeV is 5 Hz from direct \(J/\Psi\) production and 3 Hz from \(B\to J/\Psi X\) decays [6].

Using an offline selection, the expected rate for inclusive \(\,J/\Psi\to ee\) together with a 6 GeV muon is about 32 Hz (i.e. 0.35 % w.r.t. to the initial \(\mu 6\) rate of 9 kHz after LVL2). This corresponds to an additional rejection factor of about 10 w.r.t. to the reduction achievable by the \(J/\Psi\) requirements at LVL2.

#### d.7.3 \(D_{s}\) selection

A study done by F. Rizatdinova and N. Nikitine for the \(D_{s}\to\phi(KK)\pi\) decay has shown that using offline code with vertexing and tight mass cuts, a reduction of 0.55 % relative to the inclusive single muon rate (\(p_{T}>6\) GeV) can be achieved. For comparison, the reduction estimated for LVL2 (without vertexing and using only loose mass cuts) is 2.1 % relative to the \(\mu 6\) rate.

This reduction factor of 4 would give an EF rate of about 50 Hz.

#### d.7.4 \(B_{d}\to\pi\pi\) selection

A study on the background reduction yielded a remaining background of about \(5\times 10^{-4}\), leading to an expected rate of about 5 Hz (no signal included yet). This gives a reduction factor of about 12 w.r.t. to LVL2.
