**Abstract**

This note describes the University of Athens Muon Drift Tube assembly line. The nesesecary tooling together with the procedure followed for the wiring is presented. Experience and results of the performance are described based on the assembly of 295 tubes used for the BIS module 0 prototype.

Introduction

University of Athens is responsible for assembly of the BIS MDT tubes. These are ATLAS muon drift tubes of finished length of 1671.5 mm. In our wiring facility we thread the 50 \(\upmu\)m wire through the tube, place and crimp the end-plugs and finally crimp the wire after tensioning it. This operation involves a number of precision steps since a) the wire must be positioned with a \(\pm\)25 \(\upmu\)m accuracy and be tensioned at (350\(\pm\)17) gr, b) the tube has to be assembled in such a way that the accuracy on the finished length is better than 250 \(\upmu\)m and c) when operated at a pressure of 3 bar and a voltage of 3.4 kV, should have a dark current below 3.5 nA and gas leak rate below 1x10\({}^{8}\) bar l/s.

In this note we describe the University of Athens wiring line, the wiring procedure and the experience we had wiring the BIS module 0 tubes. In section 2 a brief description of the site together with the tooling involved in the wiring process is presented. Section 3 describes all the necessary steps of the tube wiring procedure. In section 4 we discuss some particular issues concerning our experience with the wiring of 295 tubes for the BIS module 0 prototype. Section 5 summarizes the results for the produced tubes, while our conclusions are presented in section 6.

## 2 General description of wiring site

The University of Athens tube wiring line consists of two laboratory areas. The first laboratory area is a clean room which houses the wiring table, two PC's, storage racks for about two hundred tubes, a desk for the endplug assembly and a tension measurement area which at present is under development. The second laboratory area is basically a tube testing facility for the HV leak current test, tests with cosmic rays and the wire tension test.

### The clean room

This is the room where the main wiring table is installed. The clean room is of a rough area of 5x10x3.5 m\({}^{3}\), including an entrance vestibule. It is equipped with two air conditioning units of 35.000 btu each and a system of two prefilters plus one absolute filter per unit. There is a 20% fresh air intake which creates an over pressure. Care is taken that the main room has an overpressure with respect to the vestibule which in turn has an overpressure with respect to the outside world. Temperature is held stable at 20\(\pm\)1\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C, controled and monitored by two thermostats (1\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C accuracy), one visual tempometer (1\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C accuracy) close to the wiring table and a sensor (0.1\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)C accuracy), which is recorded through the DAQ card using the Labview software. The entrance vestibule is equipped with a door tack mat. The clean room is fully operational and has been under constant temperature since the middle of May 1999. It has been already used for the wiring of module 0. Protective clothing including dust free coat, hair cover, gloves and booties were used during the wiring of module 0.

### The wiring table

The University of Athens wiring line follows the approach developed at Protvino (Ref 1), modified to meet our special needs. The wiring table is an aluminum bench 50cm wide and 2.5m long. On the table the various tools for wiring _(see drawing 1, top and side view and photos 1 and 2)_ are installed. This table was first used in a non clean environment to wire about 120 tubes for one multilayer of BIS -1 module last winter. No tubes were found to interfere in the jigs during the assembly of BIS module -1 in Thessaloniki. During spring 1999 major modifications of the tooling were implemented as, for instance, the automatic feeding and tensioning of the wire and the table was moved in the clean room.

Presently, there are two basic tube stations/positions used to accomplish the wiring and two additional positions for the QC checks plus one fallback position, set up. Each position/station is used to accomplish a number of different functions:

* Station 1: The wire is threaded through the tube by a vacuum force and through the end-plugs using compressed air. The wire is then crimped on one side of the tube. The station houses the tube clamps, plus the wire spool and two wire threading devices.
* Station 2: The tube is crimped pneumatically on both sides. The wire is tensioned by an automatic device and finally it is crimped on the other side of the tube. The station houses the two gas crimpers and two tube clamps plus the automatic tensioning devices.
* Station 3 (QC): Measurement of angle difference between the end-plug axis and tube axis is performed.
* Station 4 (QC): Measurement of finished tube length is performed.
* Station 5 (presently not used, fallback solution): The wire can be tensioned using weights. The station houses two tube clamps plus a frictionless pulley.

### The tools used for wiring

#### 2.3.1 Tube clamp:

A simple mechanical clamp (_left side of photo 3)_ developed and constructed by Protvino. The tube is clamped at a width of about 1 cm.

#### 2.3.2 Wire spooling and wire insertion:

The plastic wire holder is mounted on a rotating pulley _(photo 4)_. The wire is threaded through the tube by a vacuum force _(photo 5)_. The wire is attached to a frictionless light cylinder _(left side of photo 4)_ which is inserted into the tube. At the other end a rubber cup is attached to a vacuum hose _(photo 5)_ placed over the open end of the tube. The vacuum pump is then switched on and the wire is pulled through the tube with a speed of about 0.4m/sec.

#### 2.3.3 Wire crimper:

This is a simple "crocodile" spring plier _(middle of photo 6)_ developed in Protvino. In the future the spring will be replaced by a pneumatic cylinder. The new pliers are under construction in Protvino.

#### 2.3.4 Wire insertion devices:

The endplug is positioned in a V-support (_photos 7 and 8)_ and pushed by hand against the CERN air insertion device while, by means of a foot valve, compressed air of about 2 atms from a gas bottle -in order to be oil free- is turned on. There are two such devices installed at each end of the table.

#### 2.3.5 Gas crimpers:

They are built by Protvino _(right side of photo 3 and photo 9)_. They perform four different operations:

* Crimp the tube pneumatically into the end-plugs using 200 bars of pressure.

2. Provide the clocking of the tubes (using guide pins which are inserted into the end-plug threaded holes). The guide pins of both sides are aligned during the alignment phase (Appendix I).
3. Provide the variable spacing between the end-plug and the tube end (both sides) in order that the finished tube has at most a 100 \(\upmu\)m fluctuation with respect to the nominal length (the procedure is described in the next section).
4. Determine the finished tube length as the fixed distance between the inner back planes of the crimpers. In order that the crimpers perform correctly the above operations, they should satisfy the following requirements:
5. The two crimpers should be aligned.
6. The axis defined by them should be perpendicular to the back plane of the crimper (the axis of the pins-providing the clocking-should be parallel to the bench).
7. The distance between the crimper and the tube clamp is 30 cm, on both sides.
8. The distance between the two crimper's back planes, during the wiring, gets fixed to be equal to the finished tube length 1671.5cm. To accomplish this a micrometer _(photo 10)_ (with 1\(\upmu\)m accuracy) is mounted on the table and measures the relative position of the left hand side crimper which is movable.

#### 2.3.6 Wire tensioning system:

It is a copy of the system developed in the Univ. of Washington (Ref 2). It uses commercially available components: a three wheel tension meter and a linear actuator pulling the wire _(photo 11)_. A conventional PC controls the tensioning process though a DAQ1 card using the LabView software.

Footnote 1: National Instruments Co, PCI-MIO-16E-4

2.3.7 _Tube ruler:_ It consists of a precision aluminum through fixed on the table. A spring mounted on the device is directly connected to a micrometer (10\(\upmu\)m accuracy). The contact of the spring with the end-plug is done by means of a hollow aluminum tube, one end of which is in contact with the end-plug's back surface and the other with the spring2_(photo 12)_.

Footnote 2: One measures differences only between the finished tube and the reference tube (see footnote 3).

## 3 Wiring Operation Manual

### End-plug assembly procedure

All endplugs, twisters and crimp pins are cleaned in an ultra sonic bath with 100% ethyl alcohol for more than an hour. The end-plugs are assembled first by inserting the twister and then by placing the stopper into place using the tool shown on the left of _photo 6_. Next, the crimp pin has to be crimped on the brass sleeve. One should note that this crimping should be made very tight since a movement of about 10\(\upmu\)m of the crimp pin is enough for the tube to fail the wire tension QA test. After a lot of trials we found out that satisfactory crimping could be obtained by the use of a tool for cable crimping3_(right of photo 6)_. No tubes crimped that way, failed the wire tension test. The O-ring is cleaned by emerging it for a few seconds in 100% ethyl alcohol and installed on the endplug taking care to get no twists. All assembly of the cleaned end-plugs and cleaned parts is done in the clean room using disposable clear gloves and protective clothing.

### Preparation for wiring (Start up phase)

Before starting the wiring operation there are certain preparatory operations done either at the beginning of each production day or when it is judged to be necessary. The following actions are performed:

#### 3.2.1 Alignment of the wiring table.

It is done either once per week or when any of the angle differences measured in the quality checking phase appear to be systematically large. For the procedure followed, see appendix I.

The following actions are performed at the beginning of every production day:

1. Calibration of the tension meter.
2. Using two reference weights of 50 and 450 gr respectively.
3. Verification of pressure of bottle for gas crimping.

The bottle together with the gas lines are refilled when necessary using the

3.00 Atm compressor.
4. Verification of pressure of the gas bottle for wire threading.
5. Verification of lubricated compressed air pressure for the pneumatic wire crimpers.
6. Calibration of the crimper micrometer and tube length ruler, using the reference tube4.
7. The operators log on the PC, initialize the information (operation team, date, etc) for the data base and activate the software for the automatic actions during wiring.

Footnote 4: _reference tube is a raw tube,which was measured at CERN by the metrology service with high precision,on which two end-plugs are crimped without any gap. The length of the reference tube is 1648.07mm(raw tube)+2*11mm(length of end-plug)=1670.07 namely 1.43mm less than the nominal finished tube length._

### Wiring procedure (Steps of main phase)

3.1 The crew places the raw tube in the two tube clamps of position 1, placing the bar code at the 12 o'clock position and clamps it on place. The bar code gets scanned.

3.3.2 The wire is then threaded through the tube by a vacuum force. During the insertion of the wire, a plastic protection collar with a slit is inserted at the end of the tube at the wire spool side, not allowing the wire to touch the edge. After pulling the wire through, a similar plastic protection collar is inserted at the other end of the tube. One then pulls further the wire leaving about 30cm on the crimp side and 50cm on the tensioning side and cuts it.

3.3 The wire is then inserted through the endplugs, using the CERN air insertion devices installed close to both ends of the tube.

3.3.4 After the wire insertion, both endplugs are manually inserted in the tube,while removing the protection collars. Special care is taken so that no twist of the wire takes place and that one of the two clocking holes of the end-plugs -on both sides- is roughly aligned with the bar code axis. In this way, during assembly of the tubes into chambers, the bar code will be on the top and thus readable.
3.3.5 Then the wire is crimped on the left hand side (LHS) crimp tube using the Protvino "crocodile" spring plier. The LHS extra wire is then cut and the tube is released from the clamps and moved to second station.
3.3.6 The non-crimped end of the tube is inserted on the right-hand side (RHS) crimper while passing the hanging wire, by means of a thin pair of tweezers, through the central crimper hole.
3.3.7 The movable and retracted LHS crimper is then slowly moved towards the RHS. During this operation both endplug clocking holes are inserted in the two pins located on the back of both crimpers. By construction when the back plane of the crimper is perpendicular to the tube of axis, the line defined by the two pins is horizontal. Therefore when the two endplugs rest against the back face of the crimpers, the clocking pins are aligned.
3.3.8 After the endplugs are in place inside the crimper, they are secured against the back plane by means of a threaded nut which screws in the central brass pin. One has to thread the wire through the RHS nut before screwing it on.
3.3.9 The LHS crimper is pushed as far as it can go, towards the RHS and a measurement using the micrometer installed on the table, is taken. This reading gives directly the length that has to be added to the tube -provided by the gaps between tube and endplug- in order that the finished tube length will be equal to the nominal length of 1671.5 mm.This number (which is typically of 1.5 mm but fluctuates according to the raw tube length) has to be divided by two in order to give the size of each gap.
3.3.10 The RHS gap is created by pulling back the LHS crimper while the tube is not clamped in place. The RHS endplug does not move so the tube retracts on the left and creates the desired RHS gap.Then the tube is clamped in place and the LHS crimper is further pulled in order to create the desired LHS gap. When the gap of both sides is established then the micrometer indication is zero and the movable crimper is fixed in place.
3.3.11 The crimping procedure then takes place opening and closing both 3-way valves. The tube is crimped and the last step is the wire tensioning.
3.3.12 The RHS nut is removed and the wire is threaded through the three wheel tension meter and attached to the linear actuator tensioning it slightly.The operator activates the Labview program which automatically steps the motor to the pre-determined pre-tension (450gr was used for module 0), waits 15 secs and releases it to the tensioning value (350gr).
3.3.13 The wire is then crimped on the crimp tube using the crocodile plier,an OK is given to the PC by the operator and the step motor returns to its initial position. The wire is then cut and the tube is ready.

### QA/QC procedure

After the completion of the tube wiring, two QC checks are performed on the wiring bench:

3.4.1 Measurement of the finished tube length.

This is performed by placing the tube in the tube ruler.

3.4.2 Measurement of the coaxiality between end-plug axis and the tube axis.

The tube is supported by means of two jiigs, each made with two spheres glued on the table. Each jiig supports the tube at the precision surface of the end-plugs. The eccentricity is measured by means of a micrometer located 21 mm away from one of the spherical supports (_photo 13_). We measure the difference in \(\upmu\)m when the tube is rotated. This displacement is then converted into angular difference.

### Local Database

During the wiring and QC tests, all relevant data are entered in the local DDB.

Most of them are inserted automatically while some must be inserted manually. For the storage of the information, we used the official MDT DB which is an application in Microsoft Access originated from the Rome 1 group (Ref 3).

### Storage and shipment

After the tube is wired and tested for length and coaxiality, it is ready to be shipped to the company performing the laser welding. All tubes were handled using gloves. In order to protect them during the shipment, on each end of the tube, a plastic tube of about 5mm length and 7mm diameter was inserted in the brass pin (in order to protect the gas input from dirt) and the signal cap was then screwed on.

## 4 Experience with Module 0

### Tube handling

The module 0 tubes were shipped in 4m boxes and this length prohibited us from introducing the boxes in the clean room which is located in the first floor of the Physics building. We had to use a third area, a storage room on the ground floor and twice a day the operating team had to fetch tubes. The shipped tubes in the boxes had no protection at the ends and they were placed in a non-sealed nylon bag. The box had to be opened several times in a non-clean room enviroment in order to get tubes out. In the future the tubes will be shipped in 2m boxes and the boxes will be directly introduced and opened in the clean room.

The external surface of many tubes had black marks parallel to the tube axis, few were badly dented in the box and few were clearly non-straight.Most tubes had visible white spots and dust in the interior surface close to the tube ends. For module 0 we found out that the recommended scanner failed to read the bar code printed on the tube,so we had to manually enter the information.

### Wire

While threading the wire we noticed that few times the wire was tangled in the spool and lengths of wire of the order of 5-10m had to be thrown away till one reached a piece which was not tangled and twisted. We also noticed kinks in the spooled wire. A few samples were inspected with a 40x magnification, without noticing any irregularities.

### End-plug assembly

During the assembly and cleaning we noticed that part of the twisters were very dirty, some of them had fingerprints on, which were still visible after the ultrasonic bath. The endplugs had metal chips from the machining attached to them.We used two kind of O-rings, one from Angst and Pfister which were clean and one batch from an unknown supplier which were very dirty and left black traces on the noryl surface, while inserting them in the endplug groove.

The endplugs shipped to us had two different inner diameters of the central brass sleeve, 1mm and 1.3mm. In the case of the 1mm diameter we had to enlarge the hole in order to be able to insert the 1.2mm crimp pin. The enlargement was done using a 1.25mm drill, which we found out was the right diameter in order to get a relatively tight fit of the crimp pin.

An attempt to reuse end-plugs from tubes wired for testing, was proved to be unsuccessful, since the O-ring groove was often scratched by the tool used to remove the old O-ring.

### Wire threading in tube

Using the vacuum force threading of the wire through the tube and the tension applied to it via the spool, a highly smooth insertion of the wire through the tube was achieved. The two plastic collars helped a lot in minimizing the probability of the wire touching the edges of the tube, allowing therefore, no kinks in the part of the wire inside the tube. The wire was cut on one side. We took care that at that moment no force was applied on it. However, in some cases, the wire was already curling while coming out from the spool. In these cases the curly part of the wire was cut and a new piece of it was threaded.

### Wire insertion in end-plug

In most of the cases we observed that threading the wire through the end-plug using the CERN air insertion device without air pressure was as fast (typically 10 seconds) as using it with air pressure of 2-3 Atm (after some tests it appeared that this pressure was sufficient). There were however, some cases of "difficult" wire - end-plug combinations where the air pressure system seem to help a lot. Therefore, the device was used with air pressure through out the production without facing any problems.

Tests using tangos instead of twisters (around 10 tangos were available to us and used) showed that in this case the use of the device with air pressure was more helpful since it minimized the time needed to about the same as for the twisters. Without air pressure the time needed seemed to be significantly longer.

### Tube crimping

Special care was taken, while the tube was inserted in position for crimping, to avoid any possibility of kinks to the wire. This was achieved by the simultaneous movement of the tube by both the operators into place _(photo 14)_.

Different pressures in the range of 195-208 Atm were used for the pneumatic crimping without any obvious differences in the quality of the crimp. In certain cases a large coaxiality angle difference in the QC test was observed in either of the two sides. It was then observed, by eye inspection, that some dust or metallic chip from the end-plug had entered the crimper, which had to be removed. This was also the reason why the crimper O-rings had to be changed a few times, since they were damaged by these metal chips. During the whole period of module 0 production, we faced no particular problems with respect to the crimping devices.

### Wire tensioning

The wire tension procedure was performed automatically using LabView software. It appeared to be relatively slow (30 seconds for stepping from 0-450 gr). After several tests, it was shown that motor speed was the limiting factor. The subject is under study and we hope that, with better motor settings, a faster tensioningprocedure can be achieved. In a couple of cases in the early production, the wire was broken while being pre tensioned. This happened due to a kink of the wire outside the tube volume due to inexperience of handling the wire during the tube crimping phase.

## 5 Results from Module 0

During June 1999, 295 tubes were wired for the BIS module 0 prototype, following the procedure described above, without facing major production difficulties. We achieved a goal of about 7.5 min/tube wiring time, of which about 1-1.5min/tube was devoted to the QC checks described above. This time does not include neither the daily start up phase nor the preparation of the end-plugs. The later, however, although very time consuming, is not expected to create any bottle necks because most of it can be done in parallel with the main tube wiring activity. A half an hour time interval can be safely allocated to the daily start up phase, while at present the alignment procedure is more time consuming. We are working on a more automatic alignment system which will enable us gain significantly on this step.

In figure 2 the number of wired tubes per production day is presented. Note that the lower production rate during certain days, was mainly due to shortage of end-plugs.

Both the length of the raw tube and the finished one were monitored. The finished tube length, which has measured and registered for all tubes, is shown in figure 3. The mean value of the distribution is, as expected, 1671.5 mm, while the sigma is well below the precision requirement and found to be 50 \(\upmu\)m. The raw tube length, which actually reflects the tube fabrication precision, was deduced from the micrometer measurement of step _3.3.9_ and is shown in figure 4.

The angle difference measurement for both end-plugs is shown in figure 5. There are more than one contributions to this measurement, for example:

\(\bullet\) Non coaxiality between the end-plug axis and the tube axis (due to assembly).

\(\bullet\) Eccentricity between the end-plug back surface and the surface on which tube is crimped on (due to end-plug construction).

\(\bullet\) Non-circularity of the tube itself.

\(\bullet\) Curvature of the tube.

Thus, our measurement of eccentricity provides an upper limit on the difference of the coaxiality between end-plug and tube axis. On the other hand, our measurement is the one that counts for estimating the interference between tubes on the jig. Here one should note that out of the 295 tubes wired for module 0, only 1% had an angle difference between 2-3mrad. Most of the time this error was due to a metal chips (from the end-plug machining of the outer surface) sticking on the crimper O-rings while crimping. However, no interference of tubes was observed during assembly at the Univ. of Thessaloniki.

A possible creeping of the wire tension with time, was investigated using a monitored sample of tubes. Five tubes were repeatedly measured in what concerns the wire tension. In a twelve days interval no significant difference in the wire tension has been observed in any of them. The actual accuracy of the measurement was limited due to temperature fluctuations.

The same philosophy of time dependence investigation was followed for the leak current tests. The same test sample was measured after several days of operation at the nominal HV without showing any significant change in what concerns the leak current behavior. These measurements were performed using a home made instrument (ref 4) which was calibrated against the NTU Athens "QA/QC" setup5. The precision of the measurements was of the order of 1-2 nA due to grounding problems. For the purpose of this exercise, however, this precision was adequate. During the HV quality checks performed at the NTUA, a significant proportion of the tubes produced, were found to be above ATLAS current leak limits. This proportion was estimated to be approximately 7%. The possible reasons for this behavior were extensively investigated but no conclusive results have been obtained. It seems that neither small spots in the interior of the tubes nor smooth curls of the wire can be responsible for this behavior. Most of the tubes which showed high dark current, were subjected to reverse high voltage of 3400 V with the 93-7 gas mixture for 1-2 hours. After this treatment, all of them had current leak within the allowed limits.

Footnote 5: Keithley PicoAmperometer based system.

During the gas leak test of the tubes at NTUA, a significant amount of tubes was found to have leaks well above the ATLAS limits. The exact percentage is not well known but even not taking into account the tubes that had reused end-plugs and which presented the problems discussed above, was unexpectedly high. This problem is under investigation by several people and at present seems to be identified with the problematic shape of the O-ring groove used for the module 0 end-plugs.

## 4 Conclusions

Using a wiring line along the lines developed at Protvino, we wired all the tubes of module 0 without facing any major problems. We used automatic feeding of the wire by a vacuum force, high pressure gas for the tube crimping and an automatic wire tensioning device. We implemented two additional QA tests on the wiring table. Namely, the measurement of the finished tube length and a measurement of the coaxiality between the tube and the end-plug axis. The net wiring time per tube, including the QA tests was below 8 minutes.

The standard QA/QC tests were performed in the NTUA and results will be presented elsewhere. The tubes were assembled at the Univ. of Thessaloniki during July 1999. No mechanical problems related to construction accuracy, namely interference in the jijs were reported.

During autumn 1999 we plan to continue the production, starting with module 1 as soon as end-plugs are available. Few improvements, related mainly to a faster alignment procedure will be implemented, but basically the production line is ready and operating.
