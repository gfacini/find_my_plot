Introduction

The constructed ATLAS detector at the LHC will have the great physics discovery potential, in particular in the detection of a heavy Higgs boson [1, 2]. Calorimeters will play a crucial role in this. The key question of calorimetry is the absolute energy calibration,in particular the calibration in the electromagnetic energy scale.

The physics goals have led to the following requirement for the knowledge of the absolute scale of energy: in the case of hadronic jets, the scale should be known to an accuracy of 1% [3].

The other important issue is the energy linearity. The most stringent linearity requirements for the hadronic calorimeter come from the study of quark compositeness where the jet energy scale has to be linear within 1.5% up to the transverse energy of 4 TeV [2, 4].

For each cell of the ATLAS hadronic TILECAL calorimeter [5] the calibration constants, which define the relationship between the calorimeter signals, expressed in picoCoulombs, and the energy of the absorbed particles, which produced the signals, must be determined. The calibration constants depend on the type of particle, or jet and, generally speaking, on their energies [6]. This means that calibration constants determined for one particular type of particle, or jet of one particular energy lead to systematic mismeasurements of energy if used for the interpretation of signals caused by other particles, or jets of other energies.

Among the possible energy scales the electromagnetic energy scale has a great attraction due to a very fundamental calorimeter property which is signal linearity for electromagnetic showers since the entire electromagnetic shower energy is used to ionize and excite the molecules of which the calorimeter consists. Twice as much energy thus leads to twice as many excited and ionized molecules and should thus leads to calorimeter signals that are twice as large [6].

At high energies the electromagnetic fraction is an essential part of an hadronic shower. According to [6], it is parameterized as \(f_{em}=0.11\ln\,E\), [E]=GeV, and amounts to 25% at 10 GeV, 50% at 100 GeV and 91% at 4000 GeV.

It is assumed that for the ATLAS calorimeters the hadronic final states physics objects (hadrons, jets, missing transverse energy) should be reconstructed at first using calorimeter signals on an electromagnetic energy scale [7, 8].

With the aim of establishing of the electromagnetic energy scale and understanding of performance of the ATLAS Tile calorimeter to electrons 12% of modules have been exposed in electron beams with various energies by three possible ways: cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\) at the centers of the front face cells, \(\eta\) scan (\(\eta\) is a pseudorapidity, \(\eta=-\ln\tan((90^{o}-\theta)/2)\) in the case of the test beam setup) and tilerow scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\) for the module side cells.

This work is devoted to the determination of the electron calibration constants of the ATLAS iron-scintillator tile hadron calorimeter modules JINR-55, IFA-42 and ANL-44 on the basis of the July 2002 test beam data using the fit filter method of the PMT signal reconstruction.

Earlier we have performed the electromagnetic calibration for a number of modules [9, 10, 11]. In [12] we have obtained the electromagnetic calibration constants for the JINR-55, IFA-42 and ANL-44 modules on the basis of the July 2002 test beam data using the flat filter method of the PMT signal reconstruction.

## 2 The ATLAS Hadron Tile Calorimeter

The ATLAS Hadron Tile Calorimeter (TileCal) is a 2900 t sampling calorimeter using iron as passive material and tiles of scintillator as active material readout by wavelength shifting fibers [5]. This calorimeter will play a very important role to identify jets, measure their energy and direction, reconstruct the transverse missing energy. The goal of the TileCal is to measure hadrons energy with good resolution (\(\sigma/E=50\%\sqrt{GeV}/\sqrt{E}\oplus 3\%\)) and linearity (1-2 % up to TeV scale).

An innovative feature of this calorimeter is the orientation of the scintillators that are placed in planes perpendicular to the colliding beams (Fig. 1 (left)). This disposition simplifies the tile-fiber and fiber-PMT coupling reducing the dead spaces of the calorimeter and hence increasing hermicity. Due to this feature we can get an hermetic coverage up to \(\mid\eta\mid=1.7\) (\(\mid\eta\mid=5\) with forward calorimeters). This is very important for the reconstruction of the transverse missing energy.

The TileCal is divided into one barrel and two extended barrel sections. All three sections have a cylindrical structure with an inner radius of 2280 mm and outer one of 4230 mm. The barrel section is 5460 mm in length along the beam axis, while each extended barrel has a length of about 2910 mm. Each of the cylinders is further subdivided into 64 inde pendent azimuthally oriented modules. Within each module, there are a number of readout cells. Each cell is a set of scintillating tiles connected by fibers to 2 PMTs. The TileCal will contain 4672 cells which will be read-out by 9344 PMTs. Two fibres collect light from every scintillator tile at both of its azimuthal edges. The total number of tiles is 456000.

In this way, the calorimeter is divided in \(\eta\times\phi\) towers, which have a "pseudo-projective" geometry pointing to the nominal interaction point, and radially segmented in three depths. The thicknesses of depths at \(\eta\)=0 are 1.5 \(\lambda\) (\(\lambda\) is the nuclear interaction length) in the first sampling, 4.2 \(\lambda\) in the second one, and 1.9 \(\lambda\) in the third one, with a total depth of 7.6 \(\lambda\). The granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) at \(\eta\)=0 is 0.1\(\times\)0.1 for the first two depths and 0.2\(\times\)0.1 in the third compartment.

The iron structure of each module consists of a number of repeated periods (Fig. 1 (right)). Each period is 18 mm thick and consists of four layers. The first and third layers are formed by large trapezoidal steel plates (master plates), and spanning the full longitudinal dimension of the module. In the second and fourth layers, smaller trapezoidal steel plates (spacer plates) and scintillator tiles alternate. These layers consist of 11 different trapezoids of steel and scintillator, each spanning from 97 to 187 mm. The master plates, spacer plates and scintillator tiles are of 5 mm, 4 mm and 3 mm thick, respectively. The iron to scintillator ratio is 4.67:1 by volume.

## 3 Test beam setup

The test beam setup used for the calibration is the following (Fig. 2).

The Barrel Module 0 is the bottom module mounted on the table. The middle layer is the production barrel module BM\(\pm\) (JINR-55). The top layer is the two extended barrel modules: EBM+ (IFA-42) for \(\eta>0\) (beam left) and EBM\(-\) (ANL-44) for \(\eta<0\) (beam right). Bad PMT channel is 9 connected with the A2 cell of the BM+ module.

The layout of the readout cell geometry for modules is shown in Fig. 3. Each module is read out in three longitudinal layers. The first layer consists of A-cells, the second one -- of B- and C-cells, and the third one -- of D-cells. There are 11 transverse rows of tiles (tilerows) in a module. For a barrel module A-cells have the 1 - 3 tilerows, B- and C-cells have the 4 -7 tilerows, D-cells have the 10 - 11 tilerows. For a extended barrel module A-cells have the 1 - 3 tilerows, B- and C-cellsFigure 1: Principle of the TileCal (left). Exploded view of an assembled TileCal period (right).

Figure 2: Sketch of the July 2002 test beam setup. Barrel module JINR-55 is the middle layer. Extended Barrel modules IFA-42 \(\eta>0\) (beam left) and ANL-44 \(\eta<0\) (beam right) are the top layer.

have the \(4-6\) tilteows, D-cells have the \(7-11\) ones.

The calibration program with electrons, pions and muons was performed in the H8 beam at the CERN SPS.

## 4 Data analysis

### Data

We have used the July 2002 exposition of the setup by the electron beams with energies the 10, 20, 50, 100, 180 GeV at \(\theta=\pm 20^{o}\), \(\theta=90^{o}\), \(\eta=0.05\div 1.45\). The volume of the analyzed information is the following: 390 ntuples, 200 Gbyte, 15 million events.

Figure 3: The layout of the cell geometry.

### Calibration volume

Since the electron calibration constants will be used for the hadron energy reconstruction [13, 14] we have summed the energy depositions in the cells inside of the cone with the radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}\) in the \(\eta\times\phi\) space. The value of \(\Delta R\) is equal to 0.4 for single hadrons and 0.7 for jets [3, 15]. For the Tile calorimeter module \(\Delta\phi\) is 0.1 and therefore for \(\Delta R=0.4\) we take \(\Delta\eta=0.4\). This corresponds to whole extended barrel module and half of barrel module (Fig. 3).

### PMT signal reconstruction method

For the PMT signal reconstruction we have used the fit filter method [16, 17]. A PMT signal is sampled 9 times with the 25 ns interval. This method is based on fitting the pulse shape function, f(t), to samples \(s_{i}\) (a PMT signal is sampled 9 times with the 25 ns interval) of event

\[f(t)=R_{fit}\cdot g(t-\tau)+\mathit{ped}, \tag{1}\]

where \(g(t-\tau)\) is the known normalized pulse shape function, \(t\) is time, \(\tau\) is the phase (peak position in time), "_ped_" is a pedestal. So, the reconstructed response, \(R_{fit}\), is the amplitude of the PMT signal.

### Electron selection

The H8 electron beams at the SPS CERN are the mixture of electrons, muons and hadrons. For calibration it is important to have the pure electron beam. We have estimated that in order to have the systematic error in the electron calibration constant due to the pion contamination smaller than 0.3 % this contamination must be smaller than 1.5 % in the energy range of \(10-300\) GeV [18].

Therefore, we have performed the identification of (\(e\), \(\mu\), \(\pi\)) particles on the basis of the calorimetric information. We have used the following three selection criteria [18].

#### 4.4.1 Selection with longitudinal shower energy deposition

The first selection criterion

\[C_{i}=\sum_{\mathit{select}\,\mathit{ed}\,\mathit{i}}\ \sum_{k=1}^{2}\sum_{l=1}^{2} \,E_{i\,k\,l}/\,E_{\mathit{beam}\,\mathit{m}}\,, \tag{2}\]is a value of the relative shower energy deposition in the first two calorimeter depths, where \(E_{ikl}\) is the energy response of an _ikl_ PMT, \([E_{ikl}]=\)_pC_, \(k\) is a depth number, \(i\) is a cell number in the \(k\)-depth, \(l=1\), 2 is the PMT number in the \(ik\) cell, \([C_{i}]=\)_pC_/_GeV_.

The basis for this electron-hadron separation is the different longitudinal energy deposition for electrons and hadrons. For example, if a 100 GeV particle crosses 45 cm of the Tile calorimeter from the front face it corresponds to 18 radiation lengths or 2.2 nuclear interaction lengths. The amount of the deposited energy is equal to 95% for the electromagnetic shower and only 50% for the hadronic shower [19].

Fig. 5 (left) shows the typical \(C_{i}\) distributions. The left peak corresponds to the pion events, the right peak corresponds to the electron events.

#### 4.4.2 Selection using lateral shower energy deposition

The second selection criterion is related with the lateral shower spread

\[E_{cut}=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{c}(E_{c}^{\,\alpha}-\sum_{c}E_{c}^{\,\alpha}/N_{ cell})^{2}}}{\sum_{c}E_{c}^{\,\alpha}}\, \tag{3}\]

The peak values are \(<R_{noise}>\)=0.6 MeV and \(RMS_{noise}\)=21 MeV.

where \(l\leq c\leq N_{cell}\), \(N_{cell}\) is the used cells number, \(\alpha=0.6\). For example, for the 100 GeV hadronic shower the 99% containment radius is equal to 430 mm, but for the electromagnetic shower the one is equal to 70 mm.

Fig. 5 (center) shows the typical \(E_{cut}\) distributions. The left peak corresponds to the pion events, the right peak corresponds to the electron events.

Fig. 5 (right) shows the scatter plot of \(E_{cut}\) versus \(C_{i}\). The top right region are the electron events, the bottom left region are the pion events. These Figures allow to determine the values of the cuts and to estimate the contaminations.

We have estimated by extrapolation of the fitted pion peak curve to the region of the electron peak (Figs. 5) that the contamination of the pion events in the electron events does not exceed the 0.2% level [18].

#### 4.4.3 Rejection of muons

For the muon rejection at energies \(E_{beam}\geq 10GeV\) we have used the cut in the total deposited energy: \(E_{tot}>E_{min}\) with \(E_{min}=5\) GeV [20]. This cut effectively selects muons as muons loose a very small fraction of their energy in the calorimeter.

#### 4.4.4 Electrons selection using Cherenkov counter

At energies \(\leq 20\) GeV there is a bad selection of electrons by the \(C_{i}\) and \(E_{cut}\) criteria. This situation is greatly improved by using the first Cherenkov counter signal (cut 3). Fig. 5 (bottom)shows the typical scatter plots of \(E_{cut}\) versus \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\) and \(C_{i}\) versus \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}\). As seen, electrons (left) are well selected.

#### 4.4.5 Resultant cuts

We have used the following three cuts for the electron selection [18]: the cut 1 is \(C_{i}>0.9\div 1.1\), the cut 2 is \(E_{cut}>0.07\div 0.14\), the cut 3 is \(\tilde{\rm C}_{1}>200\div 400\).

Due to these cuts we have obtained the clean sample of the electron events for the calibration of modules of the TILECAL.

Tilecal electron response

The electron response in our calorimeter is a function of a beam energy, an incidence angle, an impact point [21].

The normalized electron response (\(E_{e}/E_{beam}\)) for \(E=20\)\(GeV\) as a function of impact point \(Z\) coordinate (bottom).

The energy response spectrum for given run (beam has the transversal spread \(\pm 15\) mm) as a rule is non-Gaussian as can be seen in Fig. 6. The mean normalized electron responses as a function of an impact point \(Z\) coordinate for A-cells and \(\eta\) scans are described by the sine function (Fig. 6, bottom):

\[f(Z)=P_{2}+P_{1}\sin\,(2\pi\,Z/P_{3}+P_{4}). \tag{4}\]

The normalized electron response (\(E_{e}/E_{beam}\)) for \(E=20\)\(GeV\) as a function of impact point \(Z\) coordinate (bottom).

Electromagnetic Energy Calibration

The calibration constants (the mean normalized electron responses) have been extracted from the data of A-cell, til and RMS values of these distributions are given in Table 13. The average value of the summary distribution (Fig. 17 (left-down)) is equal to \(\langle R_{e}\rangle=1.046\pm 0.004\) pC/GeV and \(RMS=3.8\pm 0.3\%\) for all \(\eta\) values.

### Tilerow-scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\)

Figs. 18-21 show the obtained calibration constants for tilerow-scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\) of EBM\(-\), EBM\(+\), BM\(-\), BM\(+\) modules for different energies as a function of a tilerow number. Tables 9-12 give the corresponding numerical values. Fig. 22 (down-right) demonstrates the distribution of the uniformity RMS values. The mean value is equal to \((4.1\pm 0.3)\%\). Fig. 22 (top, middle) shows the energy dependencies the constants averaged over cells. Fig. 22 (down-left) gives the RMS values of energy non-linearity for separate modules. The mean RMS value is equal \((1.3\pm 0.2)\%\). Fig. 23 demonstrates the distributions of the calibration constants for tilerow-scan for all energies for EBM\(-\), EBM\(+\), BM\(-\) and BM\(+\) modules separately, and for all modules together. The numerical values of means and RMS values of these distributions are given in Table 13. The average value of the summary distribution (Fig. 23 (down)) is equal to \(\langle R_{e}\rangle=1.082\pm 0.004\) pC/GeV and \(RMS=4.5\pm 0.3\%\).

## 7 Comparison of the high and low gain calibration constants

The Tile Calorimeter digitizer system uses the bi-linear approach with two separate high (for energies less or equal than 20 GeV) and low (for energies more than 20 GeV) gain channels [22].

The PMT signal after the shaper is split in two ways: the first one (for energies more than 20 GeV) is feed directly to the input of the ADC (low gain), while the second (for energies less or equal 20 GeV) is first amplified and then feed to the same type of ADC (high gain). The amplification factor between the low and high gains is set about 64.

Fig. 24 shows the distributions of the calibration constants for the high gain (left) and low gain (right) channels. The numerical values of the averages and differences between the corresponding averages are given in Table 14. As seen, for the \(\eta\) and tilerow scans the differences between the mean high and low gain calibration constants are equal to 0 within the errors. At the same time, for the A-cell scan this difference amounts to (3\(\pm\)0.4)%.

## 8 Uniformity of the calibration constants

Figs. 11, 16, 22 (down-right) show the distributions of the RMS uniformity values of the calibration constants for studied scans. The averages of these distributions are given in Table 14. They vary from 2.3\(\pm\)0.2% for \(\theta=20^{o}\) to 4.1\(\pm\)0.3% for \(\theta=90^{o}\). Note that the average tile-to-tile uniformity in a cell obtained on the basis of Cs data is 6% [23].

## 9 Summary of the calibration constants for all scans

The average calibration constants and RMS (%) values for EBM\(-\), EBM\(+\), BM\(-\) and BM\(+\) modules separately, and for all modules together for A-cells scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\), \(\eta\) scan and tilerows scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\), extracted from distributions shown in Figs. 12, 17, 23 are given in Table 13. The average calibration constant for \(\theta=20^{o}\) is of \((3.4\pm 0.4)\)% smaller the one for \(\theta=90^{o}\). This fact can be explained by the transition effect [24, 25, 26], decreasing of the e/mip ratio (mip is a calorimeter response to minimum ionizing particle) with decreasing of the sampling frequency (the number of active layers per radiation length of the calorimeter).

## 10 Conclusions

With the aim of establishing of an electromagnetic energy scale of the ATLAS Tile calorimeter and understanding of performance of the calorimeter to electrons 12% of modules have been exposed in electron beams with various energies by three possible ways: cell-scan at \(\theta=20^{o}\) at the centers of the front face cells, \(\eta\)-scan and tilerows scan at \(\theta=90^{o}\) for the module side cells.

We have extracted the electromagnetic energy calibration constants of the ANL-44, IFA-42 and JINR-55 modules of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter at energies E = 10, 20, 50, 100 and 180 GeV and \(\theta=20^{o}\) and \(90^{o}\) and \(\eta\) scan from the July 2002 testbeam run data using the fit filter method for the PMT signal reconstruction.

The obtained average electron calibration constants equal to \(<R_{e}>=1.046\pm 0.002\), \(RMS=3\pm 0.2\%\) for \(\theta=20^{o}\), \(<R_{e}>=1.082\pm 0.004\), \(RMS=5.3\pm 0.3\%\) for \(\theta=90^{o}\), \(<R_{e}>=1.046\pm 0.004\), \(RMS=3.8\pm 0.3\%\) for \(\eta\)-scan.

The observed variation of calibration constants (\(RMS\simeq 3.0\%\)) for A-cell and \(\eta\) scans probably means that it is necessary to determine individual calibration constant for each cell in order to achieve the 1% accuracy of the absolute energy scale of hadronic jets.

The average calibration constant for \(\theta=20^{o}\) is of \((3.4\pm 0.4)\%\) smaller the one for \(\theta=90^{o}\). This fact can be explained by the transition effect, decreasing of the e/mip ratio with decreasing of the sampling frequency.

The average RMS ununiformity values are equal to (2.3\(\pm\)0.2)% for the cell-to-cell uniformity, \((3.3\pm 0.4)\%\) for \(\eta\)- scan and (4.1\(\pm\)0.3)% for tileros.

The RMS weighted averages of energy non-linearity are equal to \((1.5\pm 0.2\%)\) for \(\theta=20^{o}\), \((1.3\pm 0.2\%)\) for \(\eta\)-scan, and \((0.6\pm 0.2\%)\) for \(\theta=90^{o}\).

The ratio of the flat method/fit method constants equals to

\(<R_{e}>_{20^{o},\ flat}/<R_{e}>_{20^{o},\ f:t}=1.106\pm 0.003\).
