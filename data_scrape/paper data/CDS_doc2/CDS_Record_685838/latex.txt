**Tracking in EAGLE (1.9 \(<\eta<\) 3) in Gallium Arsenide**

**T Sloan - 14/2/92**

Gallium Arsenide (GaAs) is a semiconductor which can be used like silicon as a charged particle detector. Its advantages over silicon are:

(a) it is faster.

(b) it is radiation hard.

(c) it can be optically coupled since it is a direct gap semiconductor.

Fig. 1 demonstrates its radiation hardness. This shows that GaAs survives fast neutron irradiation up to fluences of several times \(10^{14}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\). In addition it has been demonstrated that GaAs charged particle detectors show no deterioration in performance after \(\gamma\) irradiation doses of 20 Mrads.

In this note we show a preliminary design of a detector in EAGLE covering the very forward region (\(1.9<\eta<3\)) using GaAs. Fig. 2 shows a possible layout. This is described in the EAGLE note TRA-No-001 by A Poppleton, Kors Bos and J Schmitz where the extension of the kinematic range and the momentum resolution are discussed both with and without such a very forward detector. The detectors consist of wheels of GaAs microstrip devices covering the region \(15<r<25\) cms from the beam line.

**Radiation Levels at the Detector**

At such small radii to the beam we assume that the main radiation dose suffered by the detector is due to minimum ionising charged particles produced from \(p-p\) collisions which give a radiation dose similar in quality to that from \(\gamma\) rays. GaAs detectors have been shown to be unaffected by \(\gamma\) ray doses of 20 Mrads.

The dose rate at 1.0 cms from the beam line is 4 \(\times 10^{8}\) grey per \(10^{41}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) (\(\sim 1\) year's luminosity) (Fig. 10; G Stevenson: Aachen Proceedings) and this scales as \(\frac{1}{r^{2}}\). Therefore at radius of 15 cms the dose rate will be 1.8 \(\times 10^{4}\) Grey (ie 1.8 Mrads) per year falling to 0.7 Mrads per year at 25 cms radius. GaAs will survive many years at these dose rates.

**Occupancy**

Each wheel in fig. 2 subtends \(\Delta\eta\sim 0.3\). Assuming \(\frac{d^{2}\eta}{d\sigma d\phi}\sim 1\), the occupancy per wheel is about 0.3 \(\times 2\pi\times 20\) (assuming 20 interactions per beam crossing) ie \(\sim 38\) tracks per wheel. There are about \(3\times 10^{4}\) microstrips per wheel, so the occupancy is approximately \(10^{-3}\) per channel. This is satisfactory.

**A Detector Made from Single Sided GaAs Microstrip Cards**

These are similar to the microstrip cards which have already been made and proved to work. The layout could be in the form of a wheel as shown in figure 3 consisting of parallelogram shaped cards (fig. 4). The cards overlap as indicated by the dashed lines in fig. 3 with two such cards cut from a single 3" GaAs wafer (fig. 5). The microstrip cards would be bonded in pairs. There would be four such wheels at each mark in fig. 2 with the microstrips angled in opposite directions to provide small angle stereo. This system would provide two space points at each mark in fig. 2 so that a track segment could be constructed which will be linked to tracks in the outer detector. Redundancy for efficiency measurement comes from overlap between the cards (fig. 3) and comparison with the tracks found at larger radius in the outer tracker.

The strip widths would be 60 \(\mu\) each giving a resolution of \(\sim\) 20 \(\mu\)m perpendicular to a radius and 300 \(\mu\)m parallel to the radius.

**Cooling:** There are 3456 GaAs microstrip cards in total each with 384 channels ie a total of 1.32 \(\times 10^{6}\) channels. Assuming a power dissipation of 5 mW/channel in the read out. the total heat load will be 6.6 Kw. The device can operate at room temperature with cooling to remove this heat load.

**Engineering:** Studies are going on of a mounting system which would be stable to 20 \(\mu\)m accuracy with ambient temperature changes of \(\pm 10^{\circ}\) C.

**Detector Thickness:** Some limited evidence exists that thicknesses of 100-200 \(\mu\)m are likely to be the best compromise between minimising the problems from conversions and multiple scattering and maximising the signal to noise ratio achievable with minimum ionising particles. Assuming four layers of detector at 200 \(\mu\)m thickness per layer, particles would traverse 3.6% of a radiation length of GaAs plus the material of any support structure. Studies are currently proceeding on the problems associated with such support structures.

**Costs:** Accurate costs are difficult to assess at this stage. It has been suggested that processed wafers will cost $1000 per 4" wafer (R D Skinner, What GaAs chips should cost, 13th Annual I.E.E.E. GaAs IC Symposium, Monterey, California; 1991). Based on this estimate it can be shown that a GaAs detector covered by cards (see fig. 3) would cost 500 KFS per m\({}^{2}\) (see EAGLE transparencies October Meeting). Thus the detector proposed here would cost 1.5 MFS. At the Erice Workshop on GaAs detectors and Associated Electronics (January 1992) Vidimari (Teletra-Alcatel) estimated a similar figure to this whereas Willburn (Micron-Semiconductor) and Magarshak (Thomson CDM) estimated figures about twice this value. Thus a likely costing of the detector proposed here is 1.5-3 MFS.

**Other uses of GaAs eg in the vertex detector**

As alluded to above some limited evidence exists which indicates that the pulse amplitude will not increase with detector thickness beyond 100-200 \(\mu\)m. This evidence is contained in fig. 6 which shows the charge collection efficiency versus bias voltage on the detector for incident protons of energy 0.6, 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 MeV. At these energies the protons stop at the end of their ranges (6, 11, 30 and 56 \(\mu\)m in GaAs, respectively).

Interpreting the increase of charge collection efficiency with voltage as the increase of thickness of the depletion layer (see the lower part of fig. 6) shows that this depletion layer thickness is about 100 \(\mu\)m at the normal operating bias electric field of \(\sim 1V/\mu\)m. Thus there will be no gain in pulse amplitude for detector thicknesses \(>100\mu\)m. By implication the pulse amplitude for the 600 \(\mu\)m thick detectors tested up till now will be the same as those of thickness \(\sim 100\)\(\mu\)m. We have proved that our 600 \(\mu\)m thick microstrip detectors work satisfactorily and so, if the above argument is true, thinner detectors should also work satisfactorily. We intend in future to test such thinner detectors.

Assuming that this argument is true. GaAs becomes a relevant technology for the microvertex detector placed at a radius \(\sim\) 10 cms to the beam. At such a radius the dose rate due to minimum ionising particles will be \(\sim\) 4 Mrads per \(10^{41}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) (\(\sim\) 1 year's luminosity). GaAs will survive several years at such a dose rate.

A microvertex detector made from layers of thickness 200 \(\mu\)m would have 0.90% radiation length per GaAs layer. This is similar to the thickness per layer of alternative technologies such as silicon.
