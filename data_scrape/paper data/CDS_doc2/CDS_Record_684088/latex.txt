Introduction

In the present note the potential for the discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson in the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\,\)channel is compared for the CERN LHC and for the upgraded Tevatron collider. In order to perform a consistent comparison, the signal and background cross sections have been generated with the PYTHIA 5.7 Monte Carlo program. All events have been passed through the ATLAS fast detector simulation program ATLFAST. In the calculation of expected event numbers an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\,\)has been assumed. In order to make a comparison to the results obtained during the Tevatron workshop [1] possible, the cuts suggested in [2] have been adopted and applied to the 2 TeV Tevatron events. They have also been used to evaluate the signal significance at the LHC with the aim to compare it with the one achieved in the standard ATLAS analysis [3], as described in the _ATLAS Detector and Physics Performance Technical Design Report_[4].

In Section 2 the signal and background cross sections are given for both the LHC and the Tevatron. In Section 3 the analysis is described for the Tevatron scenario and the results obtained at various stages are compared to the results obtained in Ref.[2]. The results obtained for the LHC using the optimized Tevatron cuts are given in Section 4. Final conclusions are presented in Section 5.

## 2 Signal and background cross sections

The cross section for direct Higgs production at the Tevatron and at the LHC is dominated by the gluon-gluon fusion process. Additional contributions arise from vector boson fusion processes and from the associated production of a Higgs boson with a vector boson or a \(t\overline{t}\) pair. The next-to-leading order QCD corrections for the dominant gluon-gluon fusion process have been calculated [5] and have been found to be large. A K-factor, which is the ratio between the next-to-leading order and the leading order calculation, of \(\sim\)1.6 and \(\sim\)2.0 has been found for the LHC and the Tevatron, respectively. The corresponding QCD corrections for the other production processes have been found to be smaller, with K-factors in the order of 1.1 - 1.2.

The cross sections for the gluon-gluon fusion process used in the following have been computed as a function of the Higgs boson mass with the program _HIGLU_[6]. The leading order and the next-to-leading order values are given in Table 1 for the LHC and in Table 2 for the Tevatron. For the other production processes the leading order contributions have been computed using the PYTHIA Monte Carlo. The corresponding values are included in Tables 1 and 2. The K-factors for the \(gg\)-fusion process are included in the Tables for reference. They are important if a comparison is made to the published results from the Tevatron analysis [2].

These cross sections have been multiplied by the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\,\)and the leptonic branching ratios (\(W\to l\nu,l=e,\mu,\tau\)). The \(H\to WW^{(*)}\,\)branching ratios have been calculated using the _HDECAY_ program [7]. Their values are given as a function of the Higgs boson mass in Table 3. This Table also contains the values of \(\sigma\,\cdot\,BR_{H\,\rightarrow\,WW^{(*)}}\,\cdot\,\,BR_{ep}\) which are given for the Tevatron for the leading and next-to-leading order calculations. After appropriate summing of the various cross section contributions, weighted with the relevant K-factors, an effective K-factor in the range between 1.77 and 1.73 is found, depending on the mass of the Higgs boson.

Also the corresponding leading order LHC cross sections times branching ratios are given in Table 3. They are found to be significantly higher than the Tevatron values. Over the mass range considered, the ratio between the leading order LHC and Tevatron cross sections varies between 73 and 109. In contrast to the numbers quoted in the ATLAS TDR, the full hadronic \(\tau\) decays are included in the branching ratios. In the ATLAS TDR only the leptonic part of the \(\tau\) branching ratio has been included. The hadronic decays will however not contribute to the signal and will therefore result in a lower event acceptance after the lepton identification (e, \(\mu\)) is performed.

In addition to the direct Higgs production also the associated production with a vector boson or with a \(t\overline{t}\) pair has been included for the evaluation of the final signal significance in Ref.[2]. Although this is only a small contribution, it has to be kept in mind, if a direct comparison is made.

A comparison of the background cross sections at the LHC and at the Tevatron is shown in Table 4. The vector boson pair production (\(WW^{(*)}\), \(WZ\) and \(ZZ^{(*)}\)) and the \(t\overline{t}\) production cross sections have been computed using the PYTHIA Monte Carlo program. In addition, the single top production (\(Wt\)), which has been found to be important at the LHC, has been included in the analysis. This background has been generated using the _ONETOP_[8] Monte Carlo program. The vector boson pair production cross sections are found to be about 25% lower than the cross sections quoted in Ref. [2]. The difference is partly due to a rescaling of the cross sections by a factor 1.095 based on Tevatron data, which has been performed in the Tevatron analysis[9]. The remaining difference might be due to different structure functions used. The numbers show that the non-resonant boson pair production, which will be the dominant background after the final signal selection (see below), is only about an order of magnitude larger at the LHC than at the Tevatron. The \(t\overline{t}\) cross section increases by about two orders of magnitude, by a similar factor as the signal cross section.

The calculation of expected event numbers as presented in the following is based on the leading order cross sections for both colliders, the Tevatron and the LHC.

## 3 Tevatron analysis repeated

### Event selection

The cuts (10) to (17) as described in Ref.[2] have been applied to the data samples generated. For completeness they are listed here again. For details the reader is referred to the original discussion in Ref.[2]. In the event selection the following basic kinematic cuts have been applied:

* 2 opposite sign charged leptons
* \(P_{T}(e^{\pm})>\) 10 GeV, \(|\eta_{e}|<\) 1.5
* \(P_{T}(\mu_{1}^{\pm})>\) 10 GeV, \(P_{T}(\mu_{2}^{\pm})>\) 5 GeV, \(|\eta_{\mu}|<\) 1.5
* \(m\,(l^{+}l^{-})>\) 10 GeV, \(\Delta R(lj)>\) 0.4
* \(E_{T}^{miss\,s}>\) 10 GeV
* leading lepton: \(-0.3<\cos\theta_{l_{1}}^{*}<\) 0.8
* \(\Delta\phi(ll)<\) 160\({}^{\circ}\), \(\Delta\theta(ll)<\) 160\({}^{\circ}\)

The angle \(\theta_{l_{1}}^{*}\) is the angle between the momentum vector of the lepton pair and the momentum of the higher \(P_{T}\) lepton in the lepton pair rest frame. The last two cuts in the list \((\Delta\phi,\Delta\theta)\) exploit the spin correlation which is present for the decay \(H\to WW^{(*)}\). The decay of the scalar Higgs particle into two vector bosons results in two W's with opposite spin orientation. Due to the \(V-A\) coupling in the W-decay the leptons are emitted in the same hemisphere, with only a small angular separation. The dominant backgrounds are further rejected by applying the following cuts:

* \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\)-background rejection
* \(P_{T}(ll)>\) 20 GeV
* \(\cos\theta_{l\!-\!E_{t}^{miss}}<\) 0.5
* \(M_{T}(lE_{t}^{miss})>\) 20 GeV
* \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\)-, \(t\overline{t}\),\(WW^{(*)}\)-background rejection
* \(m\,(ll)<\) 78 GeV for \(e^{+}e^{-}\),\(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)
* \(m\,(ll)<\) 110 GeV for \(e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\)
* Jet veto cuts
* veto, if \(P_{T}^{jet_{1}}>\) 95 GeV, \(|\eta_{j}|<\) 3
* veto, if \(P_{T}^{jet_{2}}>\) 50 GeV, \(|\eta_{j}|<\) 3
* veto, if \(P_{T}^{jet_{2}}>\) 15 GeV, \(|\eta_{j}|<\) 3
* b-jet veto
* veto, if \(\mbox{jet}_{1}\) or \(\mbox{jet}_{2}\) is identified with a b-tag
* b-tagging efficiency: \(\epsilon_{b}=1.1\times 57\%\tanh\left(\frac{E_{T}^{b}}{36.05}\right)\)
* veto, if \(P_{T}^{jet_{2}}>15\) GeV, \(|\eta_{j}|<3\)

It should be noted that there seems to be a misprint in the b-tagging efficiency formula1 quoted in [2], which has been corrected to obtain the present results. The cuts listed above will be referred to as the kinematic cuts in the following.

Footnote 1: The correct efficiency formula (17) should probably read: \(\varepsilon_{b}=1.1\times 57\%\tanh\left(\frac{E_{T}^{b}}{36.05}\right)\), where \(E_{T}^{b}\) denotes the transverse energy of the b-jet.

The accepted cross sections after the kinematic cuts are given in Table 5. A lepton identification and reconstruction efficiency of 90% per lepton has been included in the calculation of these numbers.

The results obtained after applying the kinematic cuts can be directly compared to the ones given in Table I of [2]. Although in Ref.[2] it is said that the numbers quoted are given after cuts (10)-(16) are applied, the b-tag cut (17) seems to be included. Otherwise the numbers on the \(t\bar{t}\) background cannot be understood. The corresponding numbers found in the analysis of Ref.[2] are included in Table 5 (numbers in

italics ) for comparison. In the Tevatron analysis the signal cross sections are found to be higher by a factor in the range between 1.6 an 1.75. This difference can be explained to a large extent by the different normalization of the initial cross sections due to the included K-factors in the Tevatron analysis. If the effective K-factors quoted in Table 3 were included in the present analysis, the ratio between the accepted cross sections in the two analysis is found to be one within 10% (see numbers in row four of the Table) over the full mass range considered.

Also the acceptance numbers found for background events in the two analyses are similar. An acceptable agreement is found if the original differences of \(\sim 25\%\) in the WW, WZ and ZZ cross sections are accounted for. It should also be noted that the fake background from W+\(jet\) production has not been calculated in the present analysis, since it has been found to be negligible for the ATLAS TDR analysis[4]. At the level of these cuts the signal significance is still low, with values between 0.7 and 1.6\(\sigma\) over the mass range considered. The signal to background ratio is at the level of 2 to 3%. In order to further improve the signal significance additional, so called optimized (mass dependent), cuts and a likelihood analysis have been applied in Ref.[2]. The optimized cuts seem to be more important to obtain the final signal significance than the likelihood cut. Therefore the likelihood analysis has been omitted in the present study. Also this difference should be kept in mind if final significance numbers are compared.

### Transverse mass distributions

Before the optimized cuts are applied in the present analysis, some important differential transverse mass distributions are compared in the following. In Fig. 1 normalized distributions for various transverse mass definitions are shown for the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\)signal with \(m_{H}=170\) GeV and the leading \(WW^{*}\) background after the kinematic cuts listed above. In the upper row the results of the present simulation are shown for both the distribution of the transverse mass and the cluster transverse mass. The transverse mass and the cluster transverse mass as introduced in [2] are defined as:

\[M_{T}=2\ \sqrt{P_{T}^{2}(ll)+m^{2}(ll)},\]

\[M_{C}=\sqrt{P_{T}^{2}(ll)+m^{2}(ll)}+E_{T}^{miss}.\]

As in Ref.[2], a better discrimination power between signal and background is found for the cluster mass definition. For comparison, the results obtained in Ref.[2] for the same distributions are shown in the lower part of the figure. Good agreement between the two analyses is found for the shape of the \(WW^{(*)}\) background for both mass definitions. The mass resolution for the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\) signal, however, seems to be better in the Tevatron analysis than in the present analysis. The reason for this discrepancy is not yet understood. It would however be surprising if the omittedFigure 1: Normalized distributions \((1/\sigma)d\sigma/dM\) for the signal \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\,\)with \(m_{\,H}=170\) GeV (open histogram) and the leading \(WW^{(*)}\) background after the application of the kinematic cuts to the 2 TeV events. The distributions for (a) the transverse mass \(M_{T}\) (see text) and (b) the cluster transverse mass \(M_{C}\) (see text) are shown for the present analysis in the upper row. The corresponding distributions from Ref.[2] are reproduced in the lower row for comparison. The cut applied in the final event selection (see text) to the cluster transverse mass is indicated in the upper plot (b). All distributions, signal and background, have been normalized to unity.

likelihood cut would lead to such a significant change in the resolution. There is better agreement, if in the present simulation the parton level information (charged lepton and neutrino momenta before any detector resolution effects are applied) is used. The corresponding distribution of the cluster transverse mass \(M_{C}\) is shown in Fig. 2.

It has also been studied whether the cluster transverse mass \(M_{C}\) as introduced in Ref. [2] gives a better discrimination between signal and background than the conventional transverse mass definition as used in the ATLAS TDR. The latter one is computed from the transverse momenta of the dilepton and \(P_{T}^{miss}\) system

\[M_{T}(TDR)=\sqrt{2P_{T}(ll)P_{T}^{miss}\ \ (1-\cos\Delta\phi)},\]

where \(\Delta\phi\) is the angle between the vectors of the missing transverse momentum and the diplepton system in the transverse plane. The two distributions can be directly compared in Fig. 3. The distribution of the cluster transverse mass is shown in part a) and the distribution using the ATLAS TDR definition in part b) of the figure. A comparable separation between signal and background is found for the two definitions.

Figure 2: Normalized distribution \((1/\sigma)d\sigma/dM\) of the cluster transverse mass obtained in the present analysis for the signal \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) with \(m_{H}=170\) GeV (open histogram) and the leading \(WW^{(*)}\) background after the application of the kinematic cuts to 2 TeV events. The value of the cluster transverse mass has been computed using the lepton information from the MC parton level (no detector resolution effects applied, the missing transverse momentum \(P_{T}^{miss}\) has been computed from the true neutrino momenta).

### Event numbers and signal significance

For a given Higgs boson mass an additional cut optimization has been performed in Ref. [2]. For events in a signal region, defined as

\[M_{H}-60<M_{C}<M_{H}+5\ \ \mathrm{GeV}\]

the following optimized cuts have been applied:

\begin{tabular}{|l||r r r r r r|} \hline \(M_{H}\) (GeV) & 140 & 150 & 160 & 170 & 180 & 190 \\ \hline \hline \(\cos\theta_{l_{1}}^{*}\) & & \(<\) 0.6 & 0.35 & 0.35 & 0.55 & 0.75 \\ \(E_{l}^{mis\,s}\) & \(>\) 25 & 25 & 30 & 35 & 40 & 40 \\ \(min\,[M_{l}(l_{i}E_{l}^{mis\,s})]\) & \(>\) 40 & 40 & 75 & 80 & 85 & 75 \\ \(M_{T}(l_{1}E_{l}^{mis\,s})\) & \(>\) 60 & 60 & & & & \\ \(m(ll)\) & \(<\) 65 & 65 & 65 & 75 & 85 & \\ \(P_{T}(ll)\) & \(>\) 40 & 50 & 65 & 70 & 70 & 70 \\ \(\theta(ll)\) & \(<\) 100 & 100 & 70 & 70 & 90 & 90 \\ \(M_{T}\) & & \(>\) 110 & 120 & 130 & 140 & 140 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The expected \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\,\mathrm{signal}\) distributions on top of the leading \(WW^{*}\) background are shown in Fig. 4 for \(m_{H}=170\) GeV before and after the optimized

Figure 3: Normalized distributions \((1/\sigma)d\sigma/dM\) for the signal \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\nu\,\mathrm{with}\)\(m_{H}=170\) GeV (open histogram) and the leading \(WW^{(*)}\) background after the application of the kinematic cuts to the 2 TeV events: (a) The cluster transverse mass \(M_{C}\) (see text) and (b) the transverse mass \(M_{T}\)(TDR) (see text) defined in the ATLAS TDR. The cut applied in the final event selection to the cluster transverse mass is indicated in plot (a).

cuts are applied assuming an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\). In the upper row the results of the present analysis are shown, the results of Ref.[2] are presented in the lower row. While the \(WW^{(*)}\) background distribution is well reproduced, more events are found in the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\)signal distribution of Ref.[2]. Again, this might be primarily due to the included K-factors in the Tevatron analysis.

The accepted signal and background cross sections after all cuts as well as the signal significance are given in Table 6. In first order, these results can be compared to the results quoted in Table IV of Ref.[2]. The corresponding numbers of Ref.[2], excluding the associated VH prodcution, are given in Table 6 in italics for comparison.

The signal cross sections are found to be higher in the Tevatron analysis. As before, most of the effect can be explained by the different input cross sections due to the included

The results obtained in the present analysis are shown in the upper row, the results obtained in Ref.[2] are reproduced in the lower part of the figure for comparison.

K-factors in the analysis of Ref.[2]. After correction for this effect a somewhat higher acceptance, by about 10-20%, is found in the analysis of Ref.[2]. This difference might be related to the better mass resolution assumed in [2].

Also for the background rates and its mass dependence an acceptable agreement is found, if the normalization is performed to the same initial cross sections. Due to the optimized cuts the total background now depends on the Higgs boson mass.

The signal significance has been computed under various assumptions on K-factors. Since the K-factors are not known for all background processes, it does not seem to be justified to include them for the signal but not for the background. If a consistent, but probably conservative, approach is used and K-factors are ignored for both signal and background, a marginal signal significance is found. Even if an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\) and no systematic uncertainties on the background are assumed, the signal significance does not exceed the 3\(\sigma\) level. If K-factors are included for the signal and ignored for the background (i.e. set to 1), the signal significance exceeds the 3\(\sigma\) level in the mass region between \(\sim 155\) and \(\sim 170\) GeV. This approach is certainly optimistic, since in addition to a K-factor of order 1 for the background it is assumed that the absolute background level is perfectly known, an assumption which is not well justified given that the final signal and background shapes are very similar and no mass peak is reconstructed. If in addition to the signal K-factors a systematic uncertainty of \(\pm 5\%\) on the background is assumed, the signal significance is reduced and the 3\(\sigma\) level is only exceeded in a small mass region around 160 GeV.

## 4 Tevatron cuts applied to 14 TeV pp LHC-events

The optimized Tevatron selection has also been applied to the Higgs boson search at the LHC, assuming the ATLAS performance, as described in the ATLAS fast simulation. The results are summarised in Tables 7 and 8, where the numbers of expected signal and background events are given after the kinematic and optimized cuts, respectively. Again an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\)has been assumed. In Table 8 also the corresponding event numbers as obtained in the standard ATLAS analysis, are given for comparison (numbers in italics).

The main observations concerning the final event numbers after applying the kinematic and the optimized cuts are the following: the Tevatron cuts are looser than the ATLAS cuts used in the TDR. Over the mass range considered, the expected signal event numbers (Table 8) are higher by a factor in the range between 1.7 and 4.9. However, also the residual background is found to be significantly higher by a factor which is mass dependent. Around 170 GeV it is found to be 2, for lower and higher masses this factor increases. It is largest for \(m_{H}\)=190 GeV where a value of about 8.4 is reached. It can be seen that the optimized cuts used in the Tevatron analysis lead to an impressive suppression of the \(WW^{(*)}\)background for Higgs boson masses in the central region of the mass range considered. In the mass region between 160 to 170 GeV this background can be suppressed to the level of 35-40% of the signal, whereas in the standard ATLAS analysis the signal and the \(WW^{(*)}\)background are found to be comparable. The situation is however reversed for the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Wt\) backgrounds. Given the larger cross sections at the LHC for these processes, a much stronger jet veto is used in the ATLAS analysis, such that this reducible background is suppressed to the 10% level. This strong rejection is not needed at the Tevatron.

Table 7: Numbers of expected signal and background events and signal significance for \(H\to WW^{(*)}\) and an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\)after application of the Tevatron kinematic cuts to the LHC events. These cuts include the b-tag veto of Ref.[2] with the b-tagging efficiency mentioned above. The significance is given without and with the inclusion of an estimated systematic uncertainty of \(\pm\)5% on the background.

If the signal significance is computed by assuming a 5% systematic uncertainty on the background, a comparable signal significance is found for the two analyses. The significance of the analysis based on the optimized Tevatron cuts is somewhat higher in the mass region between 160 to 170, however somewhat lower outside this region. It seems that the Tevatron cuts are well optimized for a signal region around 160 - 170.

Finally, it has been investigated whether the significance at the LHC can still be improved if the strong suppression of the optimized Tevatron analysis is combined with a stronger jet veto to suppress the larger and backgrounds at the LHC. If a jet veto of 15  is applied together with all the other cuts discussed above, the results presented in Table 9 are obtained. As can be seen, the tight jet veto leads to a strong rejection of the top backgrounds, however also the signal efficiency is significantly reduced. Compared to the results discussed above, the signal to background ratio and thereby the signal significance can be improved over nearly the full

mass range. Compared to the ATLAS TDR results, the significance is found to be higher in the central mass range between 160 and 170 GeV and becomes comparable for the other Higgs boson masses.

In Fig. 5 normalized distributions for the various transverse mass definitions are shown for the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\,\)signal with \(m_{H}=170\) GeV and the leading \(WW^{(*)}\) background after the kinematic cuts with the loose jet veto described above have been applied to LHC events. As already observed for the analysis at 2 TeV, the cluster transverse mass (Fig. 5 (c)) does not substantially increase the discrimination power against the \(WW^{(*)}\) background compared to the transverse mass definition used in the ATLAS TDR (Fig. 5 (a)).

In Fig. 6 the distributions of the transverse cluster mass are shown for signal and WW* background events before (a) and after (b) the optimized cuts have been applied. In comparison to Fig. 4 the greater potential of the LHC to find the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\,\)signal is demonstrated, although at LHC energies the leading \(t\bar{t}\) background contributes significantly more to the total background.

Conclusions

In the present study the Higgs boson discovery potential in the \(\,H\to WW^{(*)}\,\)channel has been compared for the LHC and for the Tevatron. The same fast detector simulation has been applied to both experimental scenarios, and an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\) has been assumed.

The signal significance for a Higgs boson discovery in the direct \(WW^{(*)}\,\)channel at the Tevatron has been evaluated by applying the kinematic and the optimized cuts determined in Ref.[2], except the likelihood cut. The results obtained for the signal and background acceptance are in rough agreement with the results obtained in Ref.[2]. The differences in the final signal significance and therefore in the conclusions are mainly due to the inclusion of K-factors for the Higgs boson signal in the analysis of Ref.[2]. If leading order cross sections are used for both signal and background the signal significance appears to be marginal, with \(S/\sqrt{B}\) values below 3 over the full mass range.

If K-factors for the signal are included, a similar signal significance as in the Tevatron analysis is found, exceeding the 3\(\sigma\) level in the mass range between \(\sim 155\) and \(\sim 170\) GeV. This approach is however optimistic since K-factors for the background are ignored and it is assumed that the absolute level of the background is precisely known. This assumption is not well justified since the final signal and background shapes are very similar and no mass peak is reconstructed. If the K-factors are kept for the signal and an additional uncertainty of 5% on the background is assumed, the 3\(\sigma\) discovery range is reduced to a narrow mass range around 160 GeV.

The present study has also shown that the signal significance which can be achieved is clearly better at the LHC despite the larger \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Wt\) backgrounds. It has also been found that the signal significance as quoted in the ATLAS TDR can still be slightly improved if optimized cuts in a similar way as proposed in Ref.[2] are used. Such sophisticated and mass dependent cuts have not been considered at the stage of the _ATLAS Physics Performance TDR_, mainly in order to keep the analysis simple and straightforward.
