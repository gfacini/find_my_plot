**Prospects for associated single top quark production cross section measurements in the dilepton decay mode with ATLAS**

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

In addition to providing direct access to the CKM matrix parameter \(|V_{tb}|\), single top quark production is also sensitive to the existence of new heavy gauge bosons, flavor-changing neutral current interactions and various other new physics phenomena. This report outlines the prospects for measurements of the associated (Wt-channel) single top quark production cross section in the dilepton decay mode with the ATLAS detector. Most major backgrounds and sources of uncertainty are taken into account, and the performance of a simple cut-based analysis and an optimized analysis based on boosted decision trees are compared for two levels of integrated luminosity at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Relative errors on the cross section of 34% and 12% are found for integrated luminosities of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), respectively. Despite its small cross section, this channel thus appears quite promising for the first few years of ATLAS running thanks to its clean dilepton signature and lack of dependence on \(b\)-tagging for the suppression of non-top backgrounds.

Introduction

Experimental studies of single top quark production are of great interest, as they allow direct access to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix parameter \(|V_{tb}|\), a free parameter in the Standard Model which is still only loosely constrained by experiment if one removes the assumption of three-generation CKM matrix unitarity. The single top quark production cross section is also modified in numerous scenarios for physics beyond the Standard Model [1], making its measurement a powerful tool in the search for new physics. In the Standard Model, three distinct mechanisms contribute to the electroweak production of single top quarks at tree level: the t-channel, the associated or Wt-channel, and the s-channel. Prospects for cross section measurements in all three modes were evaluated as part of the ATLAS Computing Systems Commissioning (CSC) exercise for single lepton final states [2]. However, the Wt-channel production generates two \(W\) bosons, and the possibility of a cross section measurement in the topology where both decay leptonically also merits attention; here, a variety of analysis techniques are used to evaluate this potential in early 14 TeV ATLAS data. Compatibility with the CSC analyses is emphasized, the ultimate goal being a comparison to the CSC results for single lepton final states. This note is organized as follows: in the next section, the phenomenology relevant to this analysis is reviewed. We then detail the procedure used to evaluate the effect of systematic uncertainties on the cross section measurement. Finally, the cross section results obtained with a robust cut-based analysis and an analysis employing multivariate analysis techniques are presented.

## 2 Phenomenology and simulation samples

The three distinct mechanisms leading to single top quark production at leading order in the Standard Model are shown in Figure 1.

In order of decreasing cross section at the LHC they are: t-channel production, where a bottom quark from gluon splitting is converted to a top quark by exchange of a spacelike \(W\) boson; associated or Wt-channel production, where an interaction between a gluon and a bottom quark in the colliding protons results in the creation of a real \(W\) boson and top quark; and s-channel production, where a highly offshell \(W\) boson from \(q\bar{q}^{\prime}\) fusion produces a \(t\bar{b}\) pair. Note that these definitions are only valid at leading order, as higher order diagrams introduce mixing between the different production channels. According to the Standard Model, the top quark decays weakly to a \(W\) boson and bottom quark close to 100% of the time; the resulting \(W\) boson can then decay to a pair of quarks or leptons. In this study, we attempt to isolate Wt-channel single top events in the topologies where both the \(W\) from the top decay and the 'associated' \(W\) decay leptonically. The final state objects which characterize these events are two charged leptons with large transverse momentum \(p_{T}\), a single

high-\(p_{T}\)\(b\)-jet from the top decay, and significant missing transverse energy \(\not{E}_{T}\) due to the presence of two neutrinos from the \(W\) decays.

As with all single top analyses, pair production of top quarks is an important background, particularly in the dilepton decay mode, whose signature differs from the signal by the addition of a single high-\(p_{T}\)\(b\)-jet. Diboson (\(WW\), \(ZZ\), \(WZ\)) events are also a concern, as they can contain multiple isolated leptons, jets, and large missing transverse energy. Interactions where a single \(Z\) boson is produced and decays to a pair of charged leptons cannot be neglected due to their large cross section. Finally, events where a single \(W\) boson is produced with jets, single top events in the leptonic t- and s-channels or the semileptonic Wt-channel, and multi-jet QCD events may pass the event selection due to the presence of fake leptons. The stringent lepton isolation criteria and \(\not{E}_{T}\) cuts used here should allow us to eliminate the latter almost completely, so we neglect the QCD background in this report. Of course, this will have to be studied further once real data becomes available.

As shown in Table 1, we use a variety of Monte Carlo generators as a source of simulated events: AcerMC [3] for the single top channels, MC@NLO [4] for the top pair background, HERWIG [5] for the diboson production, and PYTHIA [6] for \(W/Z\) events. These employ the CTEQ6M (MC@NLO) and CTEQ6L (others) PDF sets [7] through the LHAPDF interface library [8]. The generator output is run through the ATLAS fast simulation or a full detector simulation based on GEANT4. Tau lepton final states with both leptonic and hadronic tau decays are included in the simulation; however, the filtering and event selection are geared toward electrons and muons. We will use the term 'lepton' in an analysis context to refer to electrons and muons only.

Treatment of uncertainties

In this section, we explain the procedure used to evaluate the effect of statistical and systematic uncertainties on the measurement of the Wt-channel cross section. We consider three effects that hinder our ability to measure the Wt-channel cross section precisely: uncertainties on the jet energy scale, integrated luminosity, and theoretical cross sections for background processes. These were found to be the dominant systematic uncertainties in the single top CSC analyses. Of course, other sources of uncertainty on this measurement exist, both theoretical (choice of generator or parton density functions, underlying event model) and experimental (uncertainty on lepton selection or trigger efficiencies, effect of pile-up at high luminosity). Any future measurement will need to give these a full treatment.

The effect of the jet energy scale uncertainty on the event selection is quantified by scaling the transverse momenta and energies of all jets in an event up or down by 5% in the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) analyses and 1% in the 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) analyses, rescaling \(\not{E}_{T}\) according to its jet content, and reapplying our selection. The assumption that the jet energy scale uncertainty will be reducible to 1% with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) is the same as that used in the CSC studies of single top production; the effect of uncertainties is broken down in Tables 4 and 8 so that the effect of different assumptions can be evaluated.

A precise measurement of the integrated luminosity in ATLAS will be very challenging, and since this quantity is used in both the background level estimate and the actual cross section measurement, the effect of its uncertainty on our measurement cannot be ignored. During the first year of data-taking, ATLAS will have to rely on machine estimates for its luminosity measurements: we thus use a shift of 5% in the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) analyses. As more of the ATLAS luminosity monitors (LUCID, ALFA, ZDC) come online in subsequent years, the precision on the integrated luminosity will greatly improve: an uncertainty of 3% is thus used in the 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) analyses, again to facilitate a comparison with the existing CSC analyses.

For each background dataset, the event yield is estimated by multiplying the selection efficiency obtained from Monte Carlo simulations, the theoretical cross section, and the integrated luminosity. However, the theoretical cross section predictions for many of our background processes have large uncertainties due to the choices of factorisation scale, parton distribution functions and the uncertainty on the top quark mass. We thus apply uncertainties of 10% on the \(t\bar{t}\) event yields and 20% on the \(Z\) estimates, which are added in quadrature to account for this effect in the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) analyses. The 20% value for the \(Z\) background was chosen for Alpgen Monte Carlo samples with different kinematics; nevertheless, we keep this value for simplicity. \(W\) background events will not be included in the cross section uncertainty calculation, so we associate no uncertainty to the theoretical cross section for these processes. In the 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) analyses, we apply a 3% variation on the total background level and assume that enough simulated data is available to reduce the uncertainty due to Monte Carlo statistics to a negligible level. This, too, follows what was done in the CSC analyses.

### Propagation to the cross section measurement

In both the cut-based and multivariate analyses, candidates passing our selection are separated into three orthogonal analysis channels based on the flavour combination of the final state leptons: \(e\mu\), \(ee\), and \(\mu\mu\). Given the number of data events \(N\) and the predicted number of background events \(B\), the efficiency for signal events \(\epsilon\) as determined from simulation, and the integrated luminosity \(\cal L\), the cross section measurement from a single analysis channel is obtained using Equation 1.

\[\sigma=\frac{N-B}{\epsilon\times\cal L} \tag{1}\]

We use a toy Monte Carlo to propagate the effect of statistical and systematic uncertainties from \(N\), \(B\), \(\epsilon\), and \(\cal L\) to \(\sigma\). \(N\) is generated from a Poisson distribution and \(B\), \(\epsilon\), and \(\cal L\) are shifted about their central values following a Gaussian distribution for each source of uncertainty. This yields a single measurement of \(\sigma\). This is repeated a few thousand times for each channel, and the mean and RMS of the resulting distribution are interpreted as the measured cross section and its uncertainty, respectively. The three cross section distributions are then combined by minimizing a likelihood function to yield a single measurement of the cross section and its uncertainty. Note that uncertainties on the luminosity and jet energy scale are treated as being fully correlated between analysis channels.

## 4 Cut-based analysis

In this section, successive cuts on kinematic variables are used to select signal candidates and reject background. Electrons and muons are reconstructed within the fiducial volume of the inner detector, corresponding to the pseudorapidity region \(|\eta|<2.5\). We use isolated electrons passing the standard'medium' selection [9] and isolated best-match STACO muons [10]. Candidate events are first required to contain two opposite-signed leptons, both passing the object selection and having transverse momentum greater than 30 GeV. This rejects events with non-prompt leptons, selects events which are very efficiently (\(>\)99%) triggered with single high-\(p_{T}\) lepton triggers, and ensures that the trigger efficiencies are on the plateau, thus decreasing our sensitivity to trigger uncertainties. Events having any additional reconstructed leptons that pass the object selection are vetoed to reject some of the diboson background and ensure the orthogonality of the analysis channels. This reduces the combined \(WZ+ZZ\) background by 39%, for a loss in signal of 1%. In the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels, the invariant mass of the lepton pair must lie outside a 20 GeV range centered on the \(Z\) mass to reduce contamination from the \(Z\) background.

Particle jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV are reconstructed within the acceptance of the calorimeters (\(|\eta|<5\)) using a cone algorithm with radius parameter \(R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.4\). We select events having one reconstructed jet with transverse momentum greater than 30 GeV. Recall from Section 2 that the difference between the signal and top pair dilepton final states is the presence of a second high-\(p_{T}\)\(b\)-jet in the latter. In signal candidates, if a second jet is reconstructed, it is usually due to initial/final state radiation and thus has low \(p_{T}\), making an upper cut on this value a powerful weapon against the top pair background.

The performance of such a cut is evaluated in Figure 2. Ultimately, we require that the transverse momentum of the second jet (if present) be less than 20 GeV in order to reject as many top pair events as possible while avoiding the threshold effect at 15 GeV.

Figure 2: (a) Distributions of the number of reconstructed jets with \(p_{T}>\)30 GeV and (b) selection efficiency as a function of the upper cut on the second jet \(p_{T}\) for simulated signal (green full line, discs) and top pair (blue dashed line, squares) events having two good high-\(p_{T}\) leptons of opposite sign and at least one good high-\(p_{T}\) jet. Uncertainties are due to Monte Carlo statistics only.

We also demand more than 20 GeV of missing transverse energy in the \(e\mu\) channel, effectively selecting events containing leptonic \(W\) decays. This cut is raised to 30 GeV in the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels to improve discrimination against \(Z\to ee\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) background events, which possess no real source of missing transverse energy.

Various detector effects prompt us to apply additional selection criteria. First, events where a good electron is reconstructed in the calorimeter barrel-endcap crack region (\(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)) are vetoed due to poor electron reconstruction performance and a high rate of jets misidentified as electrons in this region. This results in a loss of less than 1% of signal events. Figure (a)a shows that a large fraction of \(Z\to\mu\mu\) events with large \(\not{E}_{T}\) have a muon in the transition region between the barrel and endcap in the muon spectrometer (\(1.1<|\eta|<1.7\)).

Indeed, the resolution of the standalone muon \(p_{T}\) measurement, which is used in the \(\not{E}_{T}\) calculation, is relatively poor in this pseudorapidity region. This degradation is due to the reduced number of MDT stations crossed by muons, the low magnetic field integral in the transition region between the barrel and endcap toroids, and the material in the endcap toroid. We thus veto candidates where a good muon is reconstructed in this \(|\eta|\) range, but only if the \(\not{E}_{T}\) vector is either aligned (\(\Delta\phi<0.5\)) or anti-aligned (\(\Delta\phi>\pi-0.5\)) with the direction of that muon. This gets rid of 48% of the remaining \(Z\to\mu\mu\) events at this stage, for a 15% loss of signal efficiency. Dimuon events where both muons lie in this \(|\eta|\) range are also vetoed, resulting in a further loss of 3% signal. The effect of these vetos can be clearly seen in Figure (b)b: a large proportion of the events which have large fake \(\not{E}_{T}\) due mostly to muon mismeasurement (the markers near the diagonal) disappear after the vetos are applied. This loss of acceptance would be ameliorated by a recomputation of \(\not{E}_{T}\) using also the muon momentum measurement from the inner detector: this will be the subject of further study.

The resulting event yields for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Table 2. When a dataset has no simulated events passing all cuts, the number quoted in the table is obtained by passing a single event; these datasets are then ignored in the cross section calculation. Rows marked with a star (\({}^{*}\)) represent backgrounds that satisfy our event selection owing to the presence of fake leptons. Following the CSC note, we will ignore these in our cross section calculation and the multivariate analysis of Section 5; the numbers and limits given are purely for informational purposes and are not included in the total background calculation. Note that in the context of an early data analysis, the contribution from these backgrounds can be determined by looking at same-signed dilepton candidates in the data.

The \(e\mu\) channel performs best due to its reduced sensitivity to the \(Z\) background; however, the additional requirements imposed in the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels to contain this background appear effective. The yield of \(Z\to\mu\mu\) events is much larger than the yield of \(Z\to ee\); this is due about equally to the differences in lepton selection efficiencies between electrons and muons and to the differences in \(p_{T}\) resolution between standalone muons and electrons. Indeed, even after accounting for events where a muon falls in the muon spectrometer barrel-endcap transition region, a significant number of \(Z\to\mu\mu\) events pass the \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) cut due to fake \(\not\!\!E_{T}\) from mismeasured muons.

### Statistical and systematic uncertainties

Table 3 shows the effect of a 5% systematic shift in the jet energy scale on the event yields obtained in the previous section. Event yields for both signal and background go down when the jet energy scale is raised and vice-versa, indicating that the upper cut on the second jet \(p_{T}\) is the driving factor here. The overall effect on signal is a shift of \(\pm 3\%\), while the background variation shows a distinct asymmetry, at +9.2%-0.4%. Propagating these results to the cross section measurement and accounting for the other sources of uncertainty mentioned in Section 3 yields the results shown in Table 4. The total relative error on the cross section for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) is 50%, the dominant contributions coming from the jet energy scale, luminosity, and background cross section uncertainties. In the high-luminosity analysis, the total relative uncertainty is reduced by a factor of 2.7, and the uncertainty on the integrated luminosity emerges as a clear limiting factor for the achievable precision on this measurement. The low signal-to-background ratios obtained here mean that the error on this measurement is completely dominated by systematic effects affecting the background level estimation. One can reduce the background level by using multivariate analysis techniques and optimizing the selection criteria; this is done in the following section.

## 5 Multivariate analysis

Multivariate analysis (MVA) techniques are useful to combine the discriminating power of several variables with nontrivial correlations. In this section, boosted decision trees (BDT) are used as implemented in TMVA 3.9.5 [11] due to their relative robustness out-of-the-box and strengths in dealing with correlated input variables.

First, the same kinematic cuts as in the cut-based analysis of the previous section are applied, with a few important differences: the range cut on the dilepton invariant mass and the upper cut on the second jet \(p_{T}\) are omitted, and the \(\not{E}_{T}\) cut is set to 20 GeV for all three channels. A single BDT is trained to discriminate against the \(t\bar{t}\) background in the \(e\mu\) channel, while two are used in the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels to separate signal from the \(Z\) and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds, for a total of five decision trees. The input variables used to discriminate against \(Z\) and top pair background events are listed in Table 5 and plotted in Figures 4 and 5 respectively. Separation power is defined in Equation 2, where \(x\) is the variable under consideration and \(S(x)\) and \(B(x)\) are its probability density functions in the signal and background samples, respectively.

\[\text{Sep}=\frac{1}{2}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\frac{(S(x)-B(x))^{2}}{S(x)+B(x)}dx \tag{2}\]

The procedure used to build the discriminants is as follows. First, the sets of signal and background candidates passing the kinematics cuts are each split into two random subsamples of equal size. Two hundred decision trees are built with half the events, using an adaptive boosting algorithm and cost-complexity pruning. Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests comparing the output signal and background shapes

Here, the pruning strength is manually tuned so that the results of these tests are all \(\gtrsim 10^{-3}\), resulting in an optimal pruning strength parameter [12] of 10 for the \(Z\to ee\) BDT and 7 for the others. Other training parameters are set to their default values in TMVA 3.9.5. The resulting BDT output distributions are shown in Figure 6.

The cuts on these outputs are chosen to minimise the total relative error on the cross section in the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) analysis. The resulting event yields for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Table 6. Again, if a dataset has no simulated events passing all cuts, the number quoted in the table is obtained by passing a single event, and this dataset is ignored in the cross section calculation. Comparing with the cut-based results in Table 2, the improvement is quite drastic: \(S/B\) is increased by 110%, 67%, and 144% in the \(e\mu\), \(ee\), and \(\mu\mu\) channels respectively, with comparable or slightly higher significance (\(S/\sqrt{S+B}\)) levels.

### Statistical and systematic uncertainties

Table 7 shows the effect of a 5% systematic shift in the jet energy scale on the event yields obtained in the previous section.

The overall effect on signal is a shift of +2.1%-4.2%, while the background

variation is +11%-1.6%. Propagating these results to the cross section measurement and accounting for the other sources of uncertainty mentioned in Section 3 yields the results shown in Table 8. The total relative error on the cross section for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) is 34%, down from 50% in the cut-based analysis. Thanks to the improvement in the signal-to-background ratios, contributions from the jet energy scale, luminosity, and background cross section uncertainties were reduced by 33-62%. The relative improvement brought on by a tenfold increase in integrated luminosity is similar to the cut-based analysis case, and again, we find that the 3% uncertainty on the integrated luminosity becomes the dominant source of uncertainty in the long term.

## 6 Conclusion

We have presented a study of the prospects for associated single top cross section measurements in the dilepton decay mode at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, following the procedure, expected systematics and conventions that were used in the single top CSC analyses where possible. Our results for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) are summarized and compared to the CSC results in Table 9.

Despite its small \(\sigma\times BR\), the Wt-channel dilepton mode outperforms the semileptonic mode thanks to its clean dilepton signature. Moreover, whereas the'single lepton' single top analyses rely critically on \(b\)-tagging to suppress the large \(W\)+jets background, it is worth noting that this analysis made no use of \(b\)-tagging whatsoever, as the non-top background can be effectively suppressed by other means. This final state should also benefit substantially from the use of data-driven constraints on backgrounds. Indeed, same-signed dilepton events can be used to get a handle on the background from fake leptons, and a \(t\bar{t}\) control region can be used to cancel out many sources of uncertainty for our most important background, as shown in [14]. The Wt-channel dilepton mode can thus make a large contribution to the first measurement of the single top cross section at the LHC, whether as a complement to the t-channel or as a main analysis mode, should the \(b\)-tagging performance not live up to expectations in early ATLAS data. In the medium to long term, the 12% uncertainty achievable with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of ATLAS data translates into sensitivity at the \(8.3\sigma\) level, more than enough for a discovery claim, and 6% uncertainty on \(|V_{tb}|\), an extremely good test of the predicted unitarity of the CKM matrix.
