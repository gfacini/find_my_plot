###### Abstract

This document briefly summarizes the current status and future plans for the development of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer detector description database. It discusses the existing description databases and the associated software and proposes a plan for development for the coming year and beyond. This document is meant as both a source of information and as a starting point for discussions regarding planning for the overall Muon Database Task. Comments and suggestions are welcome and should be sent to the author.

## 1 Introduction

Development and maintenance of the detector description database represents but one aspect of the overall ATLAS Muon Database Task [1]. Other equally important tasks include development of the event data model, persistency classes and schema for the event and detector description data, design and construction of the conditions databases and its integration with the event data model, support of test beam activities, and documentation. While the degree of participation of the Muon Database Group in each task varies, depending on the particular needs, all require the group's attention and resources, and all are essential for the completion of the offline software.

The development of the detector description database, however, has recently been identified by the ATLAS computing management, the database coordination, and the software development teams as being on the critical path both for the needs of specific applications, such as simulation and reconstruction, and for the design and development of the general offline software infrastructure. It is for this reason that the Muon Database Group is currently focusing the majority of its very limitedmanpower on the development of a coherent and complete description of the Muon Spectrometer.

In Section 2, we present a brief outline of the detector description databases currently employed by the muon-specific application software. In Section 3, we summarize ongoing ATLAS-wide activities in the realm of detector description and present several projects being undertaken by the Muon Database Group to develop and test the ATLAS Generic Detector Description (AGDD) software package for the muon-specific applications. Finally, in Section 4, we discuss plans for the development of the Muon Spectrometer detector description database in the coming year, propose potential projects for new contributors, including a timetable for the coordination of these projects, and give a brief overview of the long-term plans.

## 2 Existing Descriptions of the Muon Spectrometer

### Introduction

The ATLAS offline software for the Muon Spectrometer currently obtains detector description data from two ASCII databases, AMDB (ATLAS Muon Data Base) and AGDD (ATLAS Generic Detector Description). AGDD is currently under development and evaluation as a possible replacement for AMDB. We briefly describe the status of these databases in this section.

### AMDB

AMDB [2] is a formatted ASCII file containing most of the basic parameters of the geometry, including the four subsystems and the inert matter (magnets, feet, support structure), as well as some basic parameters describing other ATLAS detectors. The algorithms needed to interpret and translate the parameters into geometrical structures are embedded in the application programs.

The AMDB database is currently used for the baseline reconstruction software, called Muonbox [3], the GEANT3 simulation software, called DICE[4], and the Persint graphics package [5] and is parsed into data structures accessed by the offline software to feed applications based on the MuonDetDescr package, such as the MOORE object-oriented reconstruction program [6] and several of the ATLAS graphics programs. AMDB is also used for the GEANT4 simulation [7] of the Muon Spectrometer and is the basis for the detector description database currently in use by the GEANT4 simulation framework called FADS/GOOFY[8].

### Agdd

In 1999, it was decided by the offline software and physics coordination that the detector description data for all ATLAS detectors should be provided in a standard format and input using common parsing software, independent of the software application. A group of computing and detector experts developed a language to be used for this purpose and a detector description coordinator, Stan Bentvelsen, was selected and asked to lead the project. The resulting language is called AGDD (ATLAS Generic Detector Description) [9] and is based on XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language) [10].

XML was selected because of the simplicity of its structured ASCII format, which allows for a relatively straightforward conversion of the existing ASCII databases and provides maintainability without the need for sophisticated editing software. Another important advantage of the choice of XML is its rapid acceptance as a standard by the global software community and the subsequent availability of parsing tools and validators easily integrated into the software architecture. A layer of ATLAS offline software called the "Generic Model" [11] has been added on top of the parsing software, to provide a simple C++ interface to the geometrical objects and their attributes. This interface defines the source of detector description data for the applications.

## 3 AGDD for the Muon Spectrometer

### Migration to Agdd

There are several key motivations for the migration of the Muon Spectrometer detector description to AGDD. The most important are the following:

* the need for a single source of detector description data for the muon-specific offline software applications;
* the need for a well-defined syntax, common with the other ATLAS detectors, which can be easily maintained and modified by the detector experts;
* the need for a common interface and set of detector description services, integrated into the offline architecture, and optimized for the applications;

For these reasons, the Muon Database Group is making a significant effort to develop, test and evaluate AGDD for the specific needs of the muon software. In addition, it should be noted that the migration to AGDD is a coordinated effort between the database development team and the application developers, with the endorsement of the Muon Software Coordinator and the ATLAS Computing Coordinator.

### Evaluation of Agdd for the Muon Software

It is important to keep in mind that, compared with the other well-tested detector description languages in ATLAS, AGDD is a newcomer. As such, it is still evolving to a certain degree, based on feedback from the subdetector and application communities, and should not be considered to be in its final form.

Indeed, the Muon Database Group has contributed to the ongoing AGDD development by translating much of AMDB into the standard AGDD syntax and testing the utility of the outcome. From this exercise, we have found several distinct advantages and disadvantages to the basic language and are currently striving to optimize it for the needs of the muon detector experts and the software applications.

Our observations include the following advantages for using AGDD to describe the Muon Spectrometer:

* The basic AGDD syntax fulfills the original goal of providing a language capable of describing the detector components in a manner that is independent of the application.
* It has the advantage that the algorithms needed to complete the interpretation are described completely in the XML along side the input parameters and are thus not hidden in the various applications.
* The generality of the language facilitates the translation of geometrical descriptions to applications, such as graphics, and maps easily to simple GEANT4 volume descriptions.

We have, however, also identified the following important shortcomings to the basic AGDD syntax:

* The XML descriptions are not optimal for construction or maintenance by the detector experts. The basic syntax does not allow one to fully exploit the symmetries of the specific detector components, so the descriptions often contain a significant amount of redundant information, making them verbose and difficult to maintain.
* The generic model interface is not optimal for all applications. This is because the detector symmetries cannot be exploited for software optimization and because of the lack of a fixed logical structure to the transient description.

The lack of a logical structure to the description in the transient model can be overcome through the building of tree structures based on the logical identifiers. This has been demonstrated for the construction of simulation geometries using the G4AGDD [12] or G4Builder [13] applications. However, the ability to provide high-level information for the generation of optimized simulation or reconstruction and the need for a maintainable description, easily modified for future changes and additions to the detector geometry, both necessitate modifications to the basic AGDD language and software.

### Muon-Specific Extensions to AGDD

To address the shortcomings of the basic AGDD syntax outlined above, we have introduced a mechanism to AGDD that allows one to extend the language for detector-specific elements. The mechanism works by defining a new element, called <compact>, whose child elements are the new detector-specific elements. Just as each basic AGDD element is mapped to a C++ class in the AGDD package, now each detector-specific element is mapped to a C++ class, defined by the element's author. In the case of the elements specific to the Muon Spectrometer, these classes appear in the package called MuonAGDD.

The C++ class corresponding to a detector-specific element provides a means for applications to access the attributes of that element. In addition, it has been required, by the Detector Description group, that each of these classes have a method, called expand(), which can generate the corresponding geometrical description, using the basic AGDD objects. These objects can then be used as input to those existingapplications which are based on the basic AGDD, such as G4Builder, G4AGDD, Persint and GraXML. The purpose of this requirement is for the developer to provide a reference geometry to be compared to the geometries constructed by the applications accessing the attributes of the element. For example, a GEANT4 geometry built from a detector-specific element, within the FADS/GOOFY framework, can be compared to the GEANT4 geometry produced by running G4AGDD on the objects produced by the element's expand() method.

Using elements developed to exploit the symmetries of the Muon Spectrometer, we are now redesigning the detector description. The goal is to simultaneously optimize the interface to the detector expert (the XML syntax) and the interface to the applications (the C++ classes). Preliminary examples have been presented at the ATLAS Software Workshop in Frascati, Italy (May, 2001) [14] and at the ATLAS Muon Week in Gaeta, Italy (June, 2001) [15]. Since that time, a significant amount of software and several XML examples have been added to the offline software repository (offline/MuonSpectrometer/MuonAGDD). This includes additions to the DTD and software necessary to describe the MDT chambers and the barrel toroid magnet.

### Application-Driven Development

The primary focus of the current effort is to build the basic infrastructure needed to feed the applications with the detector description data and to test those mechanisms with some example geometry. The goal is to first test the complete chain from the XML description to the application, evaluating and tuning the procedure, before continuing to complete the detailed descriptions of all components. Three projects were initiated in the Summer of 2001 to achieve this goal: development of the H8 test beam geometrical description in AGDD, development of the inert material description in AGDD, and the adaptation of Muonbox to use AGDD.

#### 3.4.1 Development of the H8 Test Beam Geometrical Description in AGDD

This project involves building the description of the geometrical configuration of the MDT components used in the September, 2001 H8 test beam. The test beam includes six different types of MDT chambers, aligned in a similar manner as in the final endcap configuration. The goal of the project is to construct the GEANT4 geometry using three different methods:

1. by producing an ASCII description using the AMDB format and feeding that description into GEANT4 using the Muonbox parsing routines and the software developed by the Muon Simulation Group;
2. by producing the AGDD description, including both the XML files and the associated C++ classes, outputting the description in the basic AGDD format, using the expand() mechanism, and then generating the GEANT4 geometry using the G4AGDD or G4Builder applications;
3. by developing the software needed to use the AGDD description to build the GEANT4 geometries from the basic detector parameters in a similar manner as is currently done from the AMDB description.

Method 1 is currently in use by the Muon Simulation Group to develop and test the spectrometer components in GEANT4. It can be considered as a control for the testing of the methods employing AGDD.

Method 2 essentially tests the ability of the expand() methods to generate the basic AGDD description from the compact description. Following the expansion of the descriptions, the programs G4AGDD and G4Builder, already tested on the basic AGDD syntax, can be used to generate GEANT4 geometries for simulation. This is an important step, as this process is intended be used in the future as a means for generating reference geometries to ensure that the GEANT4 geometries generated by other methods are correct. Method 3 is expected to become the standard method for generating the GEANT4 geometries. By allowing the Simulation Group to build the description from the basic parameters, freedom is allowed to use whatever means of optimization are desired. The danger of this method lies in the potential for the parameters to be misinterpreted, resulting in a different description than intended. This again supports the need to develop Method 2. The development of Method 3 is a cooperative effort between the Muon Database and Simulation Groups and first results are expected by the end of 2001.

#### Development of the Inert Material Description in Agdd

This project involves the development of the description of the inert material surrounding and contained by the Muon Spectrometer, including the magnets and the support structures. For the initial test, the barrel toroid will be described, including the coils, cryostat and supports. The project includes the development of the syntax in the DTD file, the XML description, and the associated C++ classes, including the expand() method to generate the basic AGDD description. This project concerns both the simulation and reconstruction. It is especially important for MOORE, as the simulation and Muonbox currently have mechanisms in place to retrieve the geometrical data of the inert material from AMDB, while MOORE does not. Rather than to include those mechanisms in the existing event model, as has been done for the description of the MDT, RPC and TGC components, it is desirable to build the description in AGDD and to provide the necessary mechanisms in the new event model. This would serve as a test of the model and would avoid putting resources into an effort whose days might be numbered. For the simulation, the translation of the AGDD inert material descriptions into the GEANT4 geometry will follow the method described above in Section 3.4.1. For Muonbox, access to this information, as well as to the description of the other Muon Spectrometer components, will be provided directly through the Athena framework, as discussed below in Section 3.4.3. MOORE, however, is currently designed to obtain detector description information through interface classes, called descriptors, in the MuonDetDescr package. It will thus be necessary to design a class to build the MuonDetDescr descriptors from the AGDD objects. This class, to be called AGDD_DetDescrSource, will be similar to the existing ZebraDetDescrSource class, which builds MuonDetDescr objects from the AMDB Zebra data structures, and to ObjyDetDescrSource, which builds MuonDetDescr objects from persistent description objects in the Objectivity database. The initial development of the syntax, XML files, and C++ classes for the barrel toroid description are now complete and being tested using the visualization programsPersint and GraXML. The development of the infrastructure needed to complete the chain to the MOORE reconstruction depends, in part, on modifications to the general database structure, taking it beyond the scope of the Muon Database Group. In particular, it will be necessary to have access to the AGDD description objects in Athena, requiring changes to the current architecture. Development of the muon-specific classes, such as the Barrel toroid descriptors and the local AGDD translators, will begin in Fall, 2001, but dependence on the more general software development makes it difficult to preview exactly when the entire mechanism will be in place. First results might come as early as Summer 2002.

#### Adaptation of Muonbox to Use Agdd

This project involves the modification of the Muonbox application to replace AMDB with Agdd for the input of the description of the Muon Spectrometer. It requires the completion of the AGDD syntax for all active components and inert material, the complete translation of AMDB, and a significant modification to the software mechanisms that input the detector description to the application. Initial efforts will concentrate on the existing AGDD descriptions and will provide feedback before the complete translation of AMDB.

For Muonbox, access to the detector description data is expected to be provided directly from the AGDD objects in the transient detector store. This design allows for the common usage of the parsing and description input mechanisms for various applications. However, it is not yet possible within the current Athena framework and will require some of the same changes to the architecture (providing access to AGDD objects) as required by the MOORE project. In the interim, the initial parsing of the AGDD files and construction of the corresponding descriptions will most likely be based on a standalone mechanism, similar to that used by Persint.

## 4 Future Plans

### Completion of Tests and Evaluation

Efforts in the coming months will concentrate on the completion of the AGDD tests described above. The H8 test beam geometry has been described in general using the compact AGDD and some effort has already been made to build the necessary software to parse these descriptions in the simulation framework. This work is being completed by the Muon Simulation Group. In the coming months, the Muon Database Group will concentrate on generating the GEANT4 geometry from the compact descriptions using the G4AGDD and/or G4Builder mechanisms. Following the completion of these tests, it will be possible to evaluate the methods by comparing identical simulations performed on the two geometries.

Tests of the AGDD description for the reconstruction software will require more time for completion, as it requires changes to the architecture for access to the description data. For MOORE, conversion classes will be needed for the MDT and RPC components, as well as for the barrel toroid. The evaluation will involve the comparison of events reconstructed using AMDB and then AGDD as sources of the detector description.

Testing the AGDD inert material description in MOORE is complicated by the fact that there currently exists no software to input the equivalent description from AMDB. In this case, it would be preferable to compare the AMDB and AGDD descriptions by studying their effects on the performance of Muonbox, once that application is able to input both descriptions. Alternatively, one could compare simulated events, reconstructed by Muonbox using the AMDB description, with the same events, reconstructed by MOORE using the AGDD description. Such an evaluation would be complicated by the inherent differences in the pattern recognition and tracking algorithms of the two programs, however, and would require careful analysis.

### Material Definitions

In parallel to and coordinated with the projects defined above, a serious effort is underway to compile a complete list of the materials present in all components of the Muon Spectrometer. This includes the active components, as well the surrounding inert material, such as the magnets and support structures. This effort is being coordinated by the Muon Simulation and Database Groups, but requires some effort on the part of the detector experts.

To date, only a short, very general list of material definitions exists, some of it coded in the simulation software and some described in the MuonAGDD material definitions file, Materials_Muon.xml. A significant effort remains to compile the complete list of definitions and to ensure a correct mapping between the components and the defined materials. With the cooperation of the detector experts, the complete material list is expected to be ready by Summer 2002.

### Toward a Complete Description in 2002

The tests described above will be used both to tune the syntax and software interface of the descriptions and to evaluate their ability to satisfy the demands of the muon-specific applications. Once a satisfactory solution is found, efforts will turn toward the completion of the full description of the Muon Spectrometer. This, in itself, is a significant task.

#### 4.3.1 Requirements

The development of a complete description of the Muon Spectrometer will require the following:

* Development of the compact syntax for all subdetectors (MDT, RPC, TGC, CSC) and for the inert material surrounding the detector (Barrel Toroid, Endcap Toroid, Support Structures, etc.);
* Development of the associated C++ classes necessary for the interpretation of the data and the expand() methods to generate the basic AGDD syntax;
* Development of the conversion classes and other software services required by the various software applications;
* Conversion of the AMDB descriptions to the compact AGDD syntax.

The initial conversion of the descriptions will be for AMDB version M2.8. This is the version of the detector description used to generate the simulation geometry for the ATLAS Physics Technical Design Report [16]. The motivation for this decision is the requirement by the ATLAS Physics and Software Coordination to test the data simulated using the new mechanisms against the abundance of existing Physics TDR data. The complete conversion of AMDB version M2.8 is planned for the end of 2002.

Immediately following construction of the complete AGDD description corresponding to AMDB version M2.8, it will be desirable to generate a description based on the most recent version of the detector geometry. This is necessary to test the effects of changes to the component geometry on the performance of the detector. The ability to easily change between description versions is an important requirement of the database, motivating its eventual integration into the conditions database, a task to be addressed in the coming year.

#### 4.3.2 Potential Projects for New Contributors

To complete the tasks described above, it will be absolutely necessary for collaborators other than those currently involved in the Muon Database Group to contribute significantly. It is for this reason that an important effort is being put into the development and testing of the underlying infrastructure and the creation of geometrical descriptions to be used as examples. In addition, the overall task has been divided into a set of projects, many of which could be completed in parallel and with minimal dependence on the other ATLAS software packages. These projects include:

1. Evaluation of Current AGDD Projects 1. GEANT4 simulation geometry comparisons 2. reconstruction geometry comparisons
2. Development of the AGDD Syntax and Interface/Interpretation Software 1. completion of inert material syntax and interface software 2. RPC interface software 3. TGC interface software 4. CSC syntax and interface software
3. Conversion of AMDB 1. completion of conversion of geometry version M2.8 2. conversion of geometry version 3. investigation into integration with conditions database
4. Completion of the Material List 1. completion of Material_Muon.xml definitions 2. development of AGDD syntax for materials
5. Development of the Description Model 1. development of AGDD_DetDescrSource classes 2. provision of service classes for the reconstruction software 3. integration with the Event ModelFirst results from the GEANT4 simulation studies (1a) are expected by the beginning of 2002. Results from the reconstruction geometry studies (1b) will require some additional software development (5a and 5b) and are expected in Summer, 2002.

The continuation of the development of the inert material description (2a), the development of the RPC and TGC interface software (2b and c), and the development of the CSC syntax and interface software (2d), are somewhat independent projects, the completion of which is needed for the conversion of the full AMDB description (3a and b).

The conversion from AMDB is essentially a change of formats for the description parameters and ought to be automated to ensure the integrity of the data. Investigations into the integration with the conditions database (3c) will be ongoing and will require coordination with the ATLAS-wide effort.

Completion of the list of materials for the active and inert components of the detector (4a) requires close coordination with the detector experts. There are no serious technical difficulties, although it may be desirable to modify the AGDD syntax for describing the materials (4b), to best suit the needs of the applications.

Development of the description model (5a and b) is necessary to complete the reconstruction geometry studies. Results of the simulation studies may provide important feedback toward the potential of building a standard transient view of the geometry for all applications (5c). This will be an ongoing study, potentially affecting the syntax and software interface development, as well as the integration with the conditions database.

A preliminary timetable for these projects is presented in Table 1. It should be noted that this table only summarizes those activities related directly to the development of a complete conversion of the existing AMDB database to the compact AGDD format. There are other activities, such as the development of a logical software identifier dictionary [17] and the description of the alignment platforms for the MDT multilayers, which are not included here, but are essential to the overall detector description effort.

#### ATLAS Data Challenge DC1

For the ATLAS data challenge DC1, scheduled for early 2002, the offline software management is considering requiring the production and analysis of data simulated with Muon Spectrometer geometry version 0. Using the current version of the offline software, events simulated with geometry 0 can be reconstructed by Muonbox with AMDB. For MOORE to be compatible with this version of the geometry, it would be necessary to complete one of the following options:

1. Develop translation methods for AMDB geometry version 0 to the MuonDetDescr objects, similar to those that currently exist for version M or
2. Develop AGDD descriptions for geometry version 0 and translation methods for AGDD to the MuonDetDescr objects, as described in Section 3.4.2.

Option 1 is the simpler of the two, as it requires the least amount of new software development and the new methods would be very similar to the existing ones.

However, the development of these methods would be only a temporary fix, to be discarded following the data challenge. While the new software would provide a means to test the MOORE reconstruction program using the new geometry, it would not contribute to the development or testing of any of the new database infrastructure nor would it satisfy any of the goals set forth in this document.

Option 2 requires the development and testing of software needed to complete the goals outlined in this document, albeit with a different ordering to the priorities. For it to succeed, work would have to commence immediately with the development of the descriptions and software classes based on geometry version O. This implies that comparisons based on the existing data generated with geometry version M would be delayed. In addition, the development schedule, in general, would become quite aggressive, leaving little time for testing before the beginning of the data challenge.

It is preferable for the Muon Database Group to continue the software development with the schedule outlined in Table 1. However, it is certainly understandable that changes to the overall offline software strategy may require flexibility on the group's planning. If the decision is made to use geometry version O for the data challenge, one of the above two options will be immediately put into action.

### Long-Term Planning

Until the end of 2002, efforts will concentrate on the development of a complete detector description of the Muon Spectrometer, using the compact AGDD syntax and

\end{table}
Table 1: Preliminary timetable for development of a complete conversion of the Muon Spectrometer detector description database from AMDB to AGDD, including testing and evaluation.

the associated software classes. As described above, the development process will be accompanied by a significant amount of testing and evaluation designed to optimize the resulting description both for the maintainability of the persistent descriptions and for the utility of the transient descriptions for the software applications. The process is expected to be iterative, with short development cycles allowing for the application of feedback from the evaluations.

Once an acceptable model is in place, work will concentrate on the integration of the detector description database into the conditions database. Mechanisms will be required to provide the transition between different detector geometries, to control the time validation of the various configurations, and to access and apply positional corrections from the alignment database. Specifications for the Muon Spectrometer alignment database are currently being defined [18] and work may proceed in parallel with the program described in the previous sections.
