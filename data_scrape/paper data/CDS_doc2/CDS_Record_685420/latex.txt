###### Abstract

The observability of an invisible Higgs boson produced via weak boson fusion is presented. A method to measure the expected level of background is presented. An invisible branching ratio of 25% could be reached at 95% CL with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) for a Higgs boson mass of 120 GeV/c\({}^{2}\).

## 1 Introduction

This work is motivated by the fact that many extensions of the SM lead to an invisibly decaying Higgs boson. In Majorons models, the Higgs could decay into light weakly interacting scalars [1]. In MSSM models where gaugino mass unification is required at GUT scale, studies which have been done on light Higgs bosons decaying into supersymmetric particles show that photonic or \(b\) decaying modes could be suppressed up to 80%. Nevertheless, the discovery at LHC is not affected due to the opening of other visible channels. But if the gaugino mass unification is ruled out, the invisible decays could be enhanced and the consequences for searches at LHC could be more problematic [2]. Direct searches for such a decay have been done by LEP experiments and lead to a lower Higgs mass bound of 114.4 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) assuming a Standard Model (SM) production and a totally invisible decay [3]. TeVatron prospects lead to a 3\(\sigma\) observation for a light Higgs with total invisible decay [4]. At LHC, phenomenologicalstudies have been done several years ago leading to optimistic results. In the associated production \(WH\) and \(ZH\)[5], a totally invisibly decaying Higgs boson could be discovered with an integrated luminosity of \(10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)for a mass up to \(150\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\). In the \(t\bar{t}H\) channel [6] discovery could be extended for masses up to \(200\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) with 60 fb\({}^{-1}\). These promising results need to be checked by experimental studies.

This work has been triggered by a recent paper by Eboli and Zeppenfeld [7] about the possibility to measure an invisibly decaying Higgs boson produced via Weak Boson Fusion (\(WBF\)) at LHC.

To study the measurability of this decay mode in ATLAS, sets of background and signal events have been produced using ATLFast [8] and analyzed following the guidelines of the reference [7]. The channel characteristic signature and background is studied in the section 2. The background suppression is discussed in section 3. This measurement needs a good knowledge of the background level. The determination of expected background events using physics events is discussed in section 4. Finally, ATLAS potential is discussed in section 5. The present ATLAS trigger strategy does not include a LVL1 trigger on forward jets associated to missing energy. This possibility is discussed in terms of need in the part 6.

## 2 Kinematic and signal reconstruction

### Weak boson fusion: \(qq\to qq(VV)\to qqH\)

At LHC, weak boson fusion process is, with a \(\sim 4\) pb cross section, the dominant Higgs production process after gluon fusion. In this process, two quarks emit vector bosons which produce Higgs by a fusion process as illustrated by the diagram of the figure 1. The vector boson transverse momenta are of the order of \(p_{T}^{h}\simeq m_{W}/2\) and leads to a Higgs boson momenta of \(p_{T}\sim m_{W}\) as illustrated at the parton level on the figures 2 and 3. Therefore, jets from quarks have a small scattering angle and are emitted in the high rapidity regions (see figures 4 at parton level). Moreover, since vector bosons have an energy of \(\sim m_{H}/2\) to produce the Higgs; final jets have an energy of \(O(TeV)\). An important characteristic of this process is the lack of hadronic activity in the central region due to the singlet-color exchange between the two quarks. The scattered quark and the spectator partons being a color singlet, gluon would be emitted predominantly between the quark and the very forward region. At a second order, a central hadronic activity should be present due to multiple interactions between partons of the protons.

### Signature and background

The signature of a \(qq\to qq(VV)\to qqH\) event where the Higgs decay products are invisible in the detector are two far forward and backward tagging jets of moderate \(p_{T}\) with considerable missing momentum \(p\!\!\!/_{T}\) in the central region. The search for such a signature requires good detector performances in terms of hadronic calorimetry, missing energy measurement and capacity to trigger on such events. The different cuts used for the signal selection are presented in section 2.3. The main sources of background arise from the:* Associated production of a \(Z\) with 2 jets (\(Zjj\)), where the \(Z\) decays predominantly into neutrinos
* Associated production of a \(W\) with 2 jets (\(Wjj\)), with \(W\to l\nu\) where the lepton escapes detection.
* Multi-jet production via purely QCD processes (\(QCDjj\)). The missing transverse energy is due to particles escaping detection or to semi-leptonic decays within the jets.

The corresponding processes are described in more details in section 3. All signal and background events have been generated by PYTHIA-6.158 [9]. Fragmentation, ISR and FSR have been switched on for hadronic activity simulation. Structure functions use CTEQ5L [10] parameterization for all processes. Only low luminosity regime has been considered for this study and pile-up has not been generated. Since the selection efficiency is strongly linked to low energy central jet production, corrections have been applied to take into account the pile-up at the reconstruction level.

### Kinematic and event selection

In this section, the cuts used for the event selection are formally defined; their definition is based on the knowledge of the signal and background kinematics. The two interacting quarks are scattered with a mean transverse momenta of \(p_{T}^{h}\;\sim\;m_{\,W}/2\) providing a di-jet system with a small scattering angle and large invariant mass. The two tagged jets \(j_{1}\) and \(j_{2}\) are the two highest \(p_{T}\) jets. The following cuts are defined for the \(WBF\) process identification (see figure 5).

1. \(p_{T}^{j_{1}},p_{T}^{j_{2}}>40\)\({\rm GeV}/{\rm c}\), \(|\eta_{j_{1},z}|<5\), \(|\eta_{j_{1}}-\eta_{j_{2}}|>4.4\), \(\eta_{j_{1}}\eta_{j_{2}}<0\)

where \(p_{T}^{j}\) and \(\eta_{j}\) are respectively the transverse momenta and the pseudo-rapidity of the jet \(j\). At LHC, QCD jet production leads to systems with small invariant mass. This is due to the low \(x\) gluon production in the proton. Therefore a cut on the di-jet invariant mass allows to reduce this kind of background (see figure 5).

1. \(M_{jj}>1200\)\({\rm GeV}/{\rm c}^{2}\)

The Higgs, produced with a transverse momenta \(p_{T}^{h}\sim m_{\,W}\) and decaying into invisible, leads to a high missing transverse energy (see figure 5). Therefore the following cut is applied:

1. \(p_{T}^{j}>100\)\({\rm GeV}/{\rm c}\)

The lack of central hadronic activity allows a powerful filter for QCD background by using central jet veto techniques.

1. No jets with \(p_{T}>20\)\({\rm GeV}/{\rm c}\) between \(j_{1}\) and \(j_{2}\). \(Wjj\) and \(Zjj\) backgrounds reduction can be achieved by rejecting events with at least one identified lepton. Moreover, for \(W/Z\) production, the bremsstrahlung from one of the quark lines is important, leading to a \(W/Z\) close in azimuth to one of the jets. This forces the second jet to be far away in azimuth from the first. For the signal the a priori azimuthal angle dependence is flat due to the Higgs coupling structure. Once requiring a large \(p_{T}^{j}\), the configuration with the Higgs recoiling against both jets is enhanced. The following cuts are defined for the \(Vjj\) reduction (see also figure 5).

1. No identified lepton with \(p_{T}^{e,\mu,\tau}>5,\,6,\,20\)\({\rm GeV}/{\rm c}\).
2. \(\Delta\phi_{jj}=|\phi_{j_{1}}-\phi_{j_{2}}|<1\) radergy. Events with a transverse momenta \(p_{T}^{h}<50\) GeV/c are not expected to contribute. In order to adapt the production, this has been done by \(p_{T}^{h}\) range. A pre-selection of \(p_{T}^{h}>70\) GeV/c before the reconstruction level has also been done. The table 1 shows the cross sections for each sample before and after the pre-selection.

In QCDjj events, the missing energy could be due to a jet in the beam pipe or to decays involving neutrinos. Figure 8 shows the fraction of b-jets as a function of the \(p_{T}^{h}\) threshold. More than 40% of events with \(p_{T}^{h}>100\) GeV/c contain at least one b-jet; the measured missing energy is essentially due to missing energy in the jet rather than to the limited detector acceptance. Therefore, the number of expected jets could be extrapolated from inclusive jet production at LHC. Moreover, this property could be used by defining a missing energy isolation variable

\[I=min[\phi(\not\!\!p_{T})-\phi(j_{1,2})]. \tag{1}\]

Figures 9 show the azimuthal angle between the two jets as a function of the isolation variable. A selection for \(I>1\) rad allows to reject 97% of QCDjj for a 25% signal loss. It is important to note that the final results are not affected by this cut because the

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

by PYTHIA are 1230 for \(Zjj\) and 1215 for \(Wjj\). Then, considering the electroweak component, the total number of background events becomes \(N_{B}=2930\).

As expected, the \(WBF\) core cuts (c1) and the missing energy cut are very discriminative against the \(Vjj\) events. The \(\not\!\!p_{T}>100\) GeV/c (cut (c3)) allows a good rejection of \(Z\to ll\), where leptons are not identified; the \(Zjj\) background is dominated by \(Z\) into neutrinos decays (\(\sim 95\%\)). The \(\tau\) decay events are mostly rejected by the soft hadronic activity cut. They represent only 2% after the (c1)-(c5) cuts. The \(Z\to ee,\mu\mu\) events, where the two leptons are not identified represent 3% of the events after these cuts.

The \(Wjj\) background is strongly suppressed by the lepton veto with regards to \(Zjj\). Nevertheless, the \(\tau\) contribution (given by parton level information) after all cuts represents \(f_{\tau}=44.5\%\) of the events. This important contribution is due to the misidentification of an hadronic \(\tau\) which is treated as a tagging jet. Therefore, a more careful treatment of the \(\tau\) and a veto could be applied to reduce even further this background. One of the critical point of this analysis concerns veto efficiency on the hadronic central activity. This efficiency is 0.80 for signal and \(\sim 0.53\) for QCD type \(Vjj\) events. This result overestimates by a factor 2 the background efficiency compared with an analytic calculation realized with matrix elements with 2 partons in the final state. Such a

study has been performed at the lowest order [14] and gives an efficiency of 0.87 for the signal, in agreement with PYTHIA and 0.28 for \(Vjj\) background. This uncertainty (PYTHIA vs matrix elements calculation) is actually the most important error source for \(WBF\) analysis. In this note, the results given by PYTHIA are considered in order not to underestimate the background level.

The figure 11 shows the azimuthal angle \(\phi_{jj}\) distributions for the signal and the backgrounds. This cut allows to suppress 65% of \(Zjj\) events against 53% of signal. This allows also to ensure that the QCD background is largely suppressed (see figure 9).

## 4 Experimental background determination

The evidence of an excess of events in the distribution of the figure 11 strongly depends on the knowledge of the background level. If \(\alpha\) is the systematic error on the number

of expected events \(N_{B}\), \(\alpha N_{B}\) is added in quadrature with a statistical fluctuation of \(N_{B}\). Therefore, the usual statistical estimator \(N_{S}/\sqrt{N_{B}}\) becomes:

\[K=\frac{N_{S}}{\sqrt{N_{B}}\sqrt{1+\alpha^{2}N_{B}}} \tag{2}\]

Since the term \(\alpha^{2}N_{B}>1\), the systematic error dominates. In this case, \(K\) reaches an asymptotic value as a function of the integrated luminosity. With the results given in the previous section and assuming that the number of counted events follows a Gaussian distribution, \(N_{B}\) should be known with an accuracy better than \(\alpha=9.7\%\) (\(9.8\%\)) to exclude at \(95\%\) CL a Higgs boson decaying totally in invisible with 10 (30) fb\({}^{-1}\). Actually, the LO QCD calculations give a 300 % uncertainty on the \(Vjj\) with the renormalization scale in this phase space region [7]. Nevertheless, the number of \(Vjj\) events could be directly predicted from measurement of \(Z\to ll\) and \(W\to l\nu\) with a much better precision as shown in the following subsections.

### Experimental estimation of \(Zjj\) background

This estimation could be done with \(Zjj\) events where the \(Z\) decays into electrons or muons. The \(WBF\) core cuts remain the same as for the signal. The missing energy selection (\(c3\)) is equivalent to cut on the reconstructed \(Z\) transverse momenta. The isolation cut is equivalent to cut on the minimum angle between the reconstructed \(Z\) and one of the jets. About \(29\cdot 10^{6}\)\(Z(\to ee)jj\) events have been generated with a cross section of \(3.12\cdot 10^{5}\) fb. It is supposed that efficiencies and acceptances are the same for muons and electrons (which is justified in the case of a fast simulation). After all cuts, the expected cross section is \(7.9\) fb in the \(\phi_{jj}<1\) region and \(25.5\) fb in the region \(0<\phi_{jj}<\pi\). The cross section of the background \(Z(\to Inv.)jj\) background is then

Figure 11: Differential cross section for signal and background as a function of the azimuthal angle between the two jets after isolation cut.

deduced with the formula:

\[\left[\frac{d\sigma}{d\phi_{jj}}\right]_{pred}=R\left[\frac{d\sigma}{d\phi_{jj}} \right]_{rec}=\frac{1}{\epsilon_{2e}}\frac{\mbox{Br}(\mbox{Z}\rightarrow\nu\nu)} {\mbox{Br}(\mbox{Z}\rightarrow\mbox{ee})}(1+f)\left[\frac{d\sigma}{d\phi_{jj}} \right]_{rec} \tag{3}\]

where \(R\) is the background normalization factor using \(Z(\rightarrow ee)jj\) events, \(\epsilon_{2e}=0.34\) is the probability that \(2\) electrons be within the detector acceptance (\(|\eta|<2.5\)). This efficiency is found by using the pseudo-rapidity of the \(Z\) decay products at the partonic level. Nevertheless, it would be directly measured at LHC by using the \(Zjj\) inclusive production. The term \(f=5\%\) is the fraction of \(Z(\rightarrow Inv.)jj\) events which are lepton decays.

Then, the systematic error \(\alpha N_{B}\) is given by the combination of the error on \(R\) and the statistical error on the measured \(Z\to ll\) events. The figure 12 shows the prediction of the \(\,d\sigma/d\phi_{jj}\) distribution for the \(\,Z\to ee\) events compared to the expected background. In order to minimize the Monte-Carlo uncertainty, some cuts have been relaxed (\(p_{T}^{j}>30G\)eV/c, \(p_{T}(Z)>85G\)eV/c, \(M_{jj}>800\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\)). Then, the expected background is predicted with a very good accuracy. Nevertheless, a difference in the shape of the two distributions appears, in particular for small values of \(\phi_{jj}\) where the predicted distribution has a larger slope. This can be explained by the fact that the detector acceptance in pseudo-rapidity is not the same for decay products from \(Z\to Inv.\) and from \(Z\to ee\). Indeed, the \(d\sigma/d\phi_{jj}\) distribution depends on the \(\,\theta\) production angle of the \(Z\). Moreover, the reconstruction threshold is \(5\) GeV/c for electrons and there is also a dependence of this distribution with the \(p_{T}\) of the \(Z\) decay products. The error on the normalization factor \(R\) can be estimated by the RMS of the sum of the residues defined in the figure 12 which leads to \(\sigma(R)=(0.3\pm 2.4)\%\). This error should be reduced with NLO calculations [7] and will be neglected in the following with respect to the statistical error.

By combining electrons and muons, the expected \(Z\to ll\) events with \(10\mbox{fb}^{-1}\) is \(158\) (\(352\)) in the \(\,\phi_{jj}<1\) (\(\phi_{jj}>1\)) region. This leads to an uncertainty of \(\alpha=7.9\%\) (resp. \(5.3\%\)). In fact, this can be reduced by using the shape of the \(\,d\sigma/d\phi_{jj}\) distribution.

Figure 12: Differential cross sections (left scale) \(\,d\sigma/d\phi_{jj}\) for expected background \(Zjj\) (full line) et for extrapolation from \(Z\to ll\) events (dashed line). Residue (right scale) are defined as the difference \(N_{expected}-N_{predicted}\) normalized at the total expected number.

Indeed, the ratio \((d\sigma/d\phi_{jj})_{\phi_{jj}}<(d\sigma/d\phi_{jj})_{\phi_{jj}}^{-1}<\pi\) could be known at NLO with a 5% error [7]. Being the two sets of events in the region \(\phi_{jj}<1\) and \(\phi_{jj}>1\) statistically independent, it is possible to extract the error on the \(\phi_{jj}<1\) with the second set of data. Then, the number of expected \(Zjj\) background events could be predicted with a total uncertainty of 5.6% (4.3%) with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) (30 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

### Experimental estimation of \(Wjj\) background

The \(Wjj\) background could be predicted by using \(W(\to l\nu)jj\) events with an identified lepton (\(e,\mu\)). For this study, \(6.2\cdot 10^{6}\) events have been generated with a \(p_{T}^{h}>60\) GeV/c and a cross section of \(1.3\cdot 10^{6}\) fb. The \(W\) transverse momenta is identified by the sum \(p_{T}(l)+\not\!\!p_{T}\). Then, the expected cross section is simply:

\[\left[\frac{d\sigma}{d\phi_{jj}}\right]_{pred}=R\left[\frac{d\sigma}{d\phi_{jj }}\right]_{rec}=\frac{\epsilon_{0}}{\epsilon_{1}}\frac{1}{1-f_{\tau}}\left[ \frac{d\sigma}{d\phi_{jj}}\right]_{rec} \tag{4}\]

where \(\epsilon_{0}/\epsilon_{1}=0.39\) (\(\epsilon_{0}=0.28\)) is the probability ratio for lepton to be outside (\(\epsilon_{0}\)) or within (\(\epsilon_{1}\)) the detector acceptance. \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu_{\tau}\) events are not used for the prediction. It is necessary to correct by a correction factor \(f_{\tau}\) which represents the \(\tau\) events fraction which passes all cuts. Then, the cross section \([d\sigma/d\phi_{jj}]_{rec}=117.3\) fb in the \(\phi_{jj}<1\) region. Therefore, the relative error on the normalization factor is \(\sigma(R)/R=3.4\%\). As before, only the statistical contribution is considered in the error estimation. The error is then estimated to be \(\alpha=2.4\%\) (1.4%) for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) (30 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

By combining the two sources of irreducible background, the total error on \(Vjj\) estimation is \(\alpha=3.1\%\) (2.3%) for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) (30 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

## 5 Discovery potential

If the Higgs has invisible decay modes, that would be an evidence for new physics beyond the Standard Model. This new physics could occur with a production cross section reduction with regards to SM. In order to estimate the ATLAS potential to discover a partially invisible Higgs, the model dependent variable \(\xi^{2}\) is defined as:

\[\xi^{2}=Br(H\to Inv.)\frac{\sigma_{qq\to qq\,H}}{\sigma_{qq\to qq\,H}|_{SM}} \tag{5}\]

where the second term is a factor which takes into account a possible suppression of \(WBF\) process. The table 4 shows the expected cross section after the all cuts and the \(\xi^{2}\) values which can be probed as a function of the Higgs mass for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) (30 fb\({}^{-1}\)) corresponding to one (three) year(s) of data taking at low luminosity.

Therefore, after one year of data taking, it would be possible to probe \(\xi^{2}\) values down to 35% for a light Higgs and 70% for a mass of 400 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) with a 95% CL. The figure 13 represents in (\(m_{H,}\ \xi^{2}\)) the ATLAS discovery potential with the upper part corresponding to the accessible values.

## 6 Specific LVL1 trigger implementation

Nowadays the ATLAS LVL1 trigger strategy [15] does not include "2 jets + \(\not\!\!E_{T}\)" events in the forward regions. Nevertheless such a selection is technically realizable without changes in the hardware. This section deals with the need of such a trigger in a very naive way. The FCAL trigger electronics presents the following characteristics:

* No segmentation in \(\eta\)
* Hemispheres separation for \(\eta<0\) and \(\eta>0\).
* \(\phi\) segmentation (\(\Delta\phi=0.4\)).
* An analogic balancing for each cell allows to obtain directly transverse energies.

If the forward calorimetry would not be included at the Level-1 the significance \(N_{S}/\sqrt{N_{B}}\) is reduced by a factor \(\sim 2.5\). Therefore, a specific LVL1 trigger is needed for the invisible Higgs search at LHC and the trigger rates and efficiencies should be evaluated with a full detector simulation.

\begin{tabular}{c|l||c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline  & \(m_{H}\) ( GeV/c\({}^{2}\)) & 110 & 120 & 130 & 140 & 150 & 200 & 250 & 300 & 400 \\ \hline \hline \(\mathrm{L}\) (fb\({}^{-1}\)) & \(\sigma(\phi_{jj}<1)\) (fb) & 55.4 & 60.0 & 59.1 & 63.5 & 63.1 & 57.8 & 50.1 & 41.8 & 30.5 \\ \hline

These very encouraging results have been obtained with a fast detector simulation. They should be confirmed by using a full reconstruction. A cut optimization should allow to increase the ATLAS sensitivity. A particular attention should be focused on the \(QCDjj\) background which has a huge cross section; an estimation of the systematic errors on the jet production in the forward regions has to be performed in order to conclude on its total suppression. It has been mentioned that the low energy jet production in the central region suffers of a relevant uncertainty due to \(QCD\) computation. This uncertainty will not affect the measurement because this production will be directly measured with data. Nevertheless, the discovery potential has to be estimated with a better knowledge of this veto. In this study, it has been evaluated in the most unfavourable case.

In a supersymmetric model, it has been seen that a domain in the parameter space favors the light Higgs decay into neutralinos. In a maximal mixing scenario and at the decoupling limit, the light Higgs is SM produced. \(\xi^{2}\) is therefore equal to the invisibly decaying branching ratio and the parameter space which can be probed by ATLAS is shown in the figure 13. For the pseudo-scalar Higgs, the coupling to vectors is strongly suppressed and \(\xi^{2}\) tends to 0. This is why it is necessary to consider scenarios which do not involve vector boson coupling. Moreover, even if there is an excess of events at LHC, it would be difficult to conclude on a Higgs boson signature unless a corresponding excess is also seen in the \(t\overline{t}H\) and \(W/ZH\) channels. For this, the associated production with a \(t\overline{t}\) pair [6] and a \(W/Z\)[5] should be investigated in ATLAS. In conclusion, this analysis only considers SM background processes. A study of the impact of supersymmetric backgrounds which usually carry large \(\not\!\!p_{T}\) should be realized.
