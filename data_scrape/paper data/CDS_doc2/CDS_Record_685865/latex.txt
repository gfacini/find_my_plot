## 1 Introduction

This note describes a simulation of the ATLAS detector to determine the particle fluxes expected in the inner detector. The damage to the silicon has been calculated in terms of the equivalent 1 MeV neutron flux that would produce the same damage. Simulations have been made with different detector configurations. The "Cosener's House" design for the inner detector layout as well as a design with a single barrel TRT, with the silicon layers all inside the inner radius of the TRT, have been studied.

## 2 Details of the Simulation

Simulations have been carried out with the FLUKA93 code [2]. The neutron fluxes quoted have a minimum neutron kinetic energy cut of 150 keV. Hadronic interactions have a energy threshold of 20 MeV for protons and pions and 50 MeV for other hadrons. Below this charged hadrons are ranged out to rest. A minimum kinetic energy cut-off of 10 MeV for all particles other than neutrons has been applied. This cut-off will exclude very few particles as can be seen from figure 4 which shows the energy spectra for particles in the first silicon layer of the Cosener's House design. Leptons and photons have been discarded in these simulations.

Particles produced in the primary p-p interactions as well as the "albedo" neutron flux from showers in the calorimeter are included in the simulations.

### Source

The source of secondaries from proton-proton collisions has been generated with the DTU-JET code [3]. The uncertainty in this is estimated to be around 50%, due to the choice of structure functions, and is the major systematic error in the quoted numbers. Annual fluxes are presented which assume a luminosity of \(1.7\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), an inelastic cross-section of 60 mb and an operating time of 10\({}^{7}\) sec. The uncertainty in the cross-section is of the order 10-20%. Systematic errors have not been included in any of the plots presented here.

### Description of the Detector

The design of the outer detector is based on the LAr option described in the LoI [1]. The geometry used is shown in figure 1. The differences expected with the current design of the barrel calorimeter, which consists of Pb-LAr in the EM part and Fe-Scint in the hadronic part, is expected to be small (\(<15\%\) decrease) based on studies made by Ferrari _et al._[2].

The calorimeters have been simulated by a homogenous mixture of the materials making up those detectors. The electromagnetic calorimeter consists of lead, liquid argon and iron with a volume ratio of 1.8 : 3.8 : 0.4 respectively. This is based on the design of the accordion electromagnetic calorimeter described in the LoI specifying 1.8 mm thickness of lead, which is clad between two 0.2 mm thicknesses of iron, and has 3.8 mm gaps filled with liquid argon. The hadronic calorimeter consists of iron and liquid argon with a ratio of 12 : 2.5 by volume. The densities of these homogeneous mixtures for the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters are 4.82 and 6.76 g/cm\({}^{3}\) respectively. The walls of the cryostat have also been included.

The inner detector region is in a 2 T magnetic field, parallel to the beam axis.

Two variations of the inner detector barrel layout were studied. The first was the "Cosener's House" design [4], with the barrel TRT split into two main sections with an additional two "transition detectors". Silicon layers are placed at 52, 53, 79, 81 and 105 cm radius, each with a longitudinal extent of z = \(\pm\)95 cm. This layout is shown in figure 1.

The second design simulated differed from the Cosener's House design by using a single barrel TRT with radial extent 70-110 cm. This arrangement contains silicon layers at radii of 50, 60, and 69 cm. A diagram of this layout is shown in figure 2.

Both arrangements have silicon layers at 11.5, 14.5, 20, 30 cm. All the silicon layers, except for the first three, extend from z = \(\pm\)95 cm. The first three layers extend from z = \(\pm\)35, \(\pm\)40, and \(\pm\)55. A thickness of 300 \(\mu\)m has been used. This doesn't take into account the effects of material in the supports. A simulation of the Cosener's House design was carried out with 1 mm thick layers of silicon rather than 300 \(\mu\)m to simulate the material in the supports. The effect was not found to be significant.

In both arrangements the end-cap TRT has a inner radius of 50 cm and outer radius of 100 cm and extends from z = 105-330 cm. The TRT's are assumed to contain polyethylene (CH\({}_{2}\)) of density 0.059 g/cm\({}^{3}\). The MSGC wheels have not been included.

Wheels of detectors are included at z = 58.5, 70, 96, and 109 cm. The ones at 58.5 and 70 cm extend from 15-22.5 cm. The others extend from 15-25 cm. These wheels are referred to as GaAs wheels although they have been simulated with silicon of 300 \(\mu\)m thickness. The use of silicon rather than GaAs is not expected to have any effect on the fluxes obtained.

The Cosener's House design has moderator placed on the inside of the barrel calorimeter vessel and the calorimeter entrance face in the end-cap region. The moderator is 5 cm thick in the barrel region and 10 cm thick in the end-cap region. This has been assumed to be polyethylene (CH\({}_{2}\)) of density 0.92.

In the "single barrel TRT" design four moderator configurations have been simulated to determine the effectiveness of the various parts of the moderator in reducing the albedo neutron flux.

#### 3.1.1 Relative effect of Moderator and TRT on Neutron Fluxes

The radiator in the barrel TRT plays a significant role in moderating the albedo neutrons. Figure 10 shows the comparison of neutron fluxes with:

1. No Barrel TRT and No Moderator
2. With Barrel TRT and No Moderator
3. With Barrel TRT and With Moderator

Figure 11 shows this comparison for the total neutron-equivalent damage. This data is also given in tables 5 and 6. The TRT clearly reduces the total neutron flux. For example at the radius of 52 cm (inside the barrel TRT), the neutron flux is reduced by a factor of 2 from the no moderator/no TRT simulation. The moderator produces a further reduction of a factor 3. In the total neutron-equivalent damage this effect is diluted by the primary charged tracks (mainly pions) which dominate at radii less than 50 cm.

A simulation that was carried out with a 5 cm thick end-cap moderator, gave the same fluxes as with a 10 cm thick end-cap moderator.

#### 3.1.2 Comparison of Different Moderator Configurations in the Single Barrel TRT Design

A comparison of the neutron fluxes in the single barrel TRT design with the four moderator configurations described in Section 2.2 above, is summarized in table 7 and figure 12. The comparison of the total damage in equivalent 1 MeV neutron flux is given in table 8 and figure 13.

The effect of the moderator is quite dramatic on the neutron flux calculated. For example the full moderator reduces the neutron flux by a factor of 4 in the radial region 50-70 cm. However, with the dilution of the neutron damage by the addition of the damage caused by protons, pion and kaons, the overall effectiveness of the moderator is reduced. For example, removing the moderator from the central barrel region (\(|\mathrm{z}|<100\) cm), the total neutron-equivalent damage is only increased by approximately 20-30%.

Simulations were also carried out with the moderator in the end-cap region being 5 cm thick rather than 10 cm. The resulting difference for neutron fluxes in the 50-70 cm radial range was insignificant in configuration B, in configuration C there was around a 10-15% increase, and in configuration D about a 20-30% increase.

## 4 Conclusion

Accurate modelling of the ATLAS detector has been carried out using the FLUKA93 package. Both primary particle production and albedo particle fluxes have been simulated to obtain total fluxes expected in the inner detector tracking layers.

Total fluxes, averaged over the inner detector layers, are calculated to vary from near 10\({}^{14}\) equivalent 1 MeV neutrons per cm\({}^{2}\) per year at the innermost radius considered (11.5 cm), to 10\({}^{13}\) at r=(40-50 cm), further reducing with increasing radius.

The neutron moderating effect of the TRT was compared with that of the moderator, as in the current current Cosener's House design. The TRT produces a significant reduction in the neutron flux in the inner detector.

A layout with a single barrel TRT was studied. Calculations show very similar fluxes in the inner barrel region to those calculated for the Cosener's House design. Removal of the moderator from the central barrel region, was shown to have only a 20-30% effect on the total expected radiation damage in the silicon layers, which in this design are all inside the inner radius of the barrel TRT. This could have important consequences for the barrel layout if the additional radial space becomes essential for the active detector elements. With this design, the equivalent 1 MeV neutron flux of \(10^{13}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) per year occurs at a radius of 40-50 cm.
