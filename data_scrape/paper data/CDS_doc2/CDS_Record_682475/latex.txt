**Abstract**

The top physics accessible at the LHC collider is discussed. An estimate of the number of expected \(t\bar{t}\) events is given and a program of study, which includes the \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section, the top mass, the rare decays and exotic production mechanisms, is outlined. The possibility to isolate and study the electroweak production of single top is discussed as well.

Introduction

With the recent discovery of the top-quark at Fermilab [1], top physics has moved from the search phase into the study phase. The motivations for a detailed study of the top-quark properties are numerous:

* The very large mass of the top-quark separates it from the other fermions and new physics may well be discovered in either its production or decays;
* An accurate knowledge of the top mass (\(\mathrm{m}_{top}\)) can put strong constraints on the Higgs mass (\(\mathrm{m}_{Higgs}\)).
* Top events will be the dominant background in many processes for new physics at the TeV scale.
* The \(W\to jj\) decay in top events can be used as an "in situ" calibration of hadronic calorimetry at LHC.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is a _pp_ machine designed to explore the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism up to TeV energies. Data taking at the LHC should start in the year 2005. The design centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV will be reached at the machine start-up. During the first three years of operation the luminosity (L) is expected to increase from \(10^{8}\)-\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) (low L) to the design value of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) (high L).

Top physics at the LHC is expected to be done primarily during the early running [2]. With the about 60000 \(t\bar{t}\) events expected to be produced per day (at L=\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)), LHC can be considered a "top factory": only searches for the rarest phenomena in top production or decays will be limited by statistics. Inclusive top-quark physics can be triggered on by using a single lepton trigger. For a transverse momentum \(\mathrm{P}_{T}>\)20 GeV and a pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<\)2.5, the expected muon trigger rate is of about 200 Hz for L=\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and is dominated by \(b\)-quark production. The inclusive electron trigger will be based on the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter information and at level-1 will be dominated by the very large rate of QCD jet events with a strong \(\pi^{0}\) component. However, by adding the tracking information at level-2, it should be possible to limit the rate to about 200 Hz for \(\mathrm{P}_{T}>\)20 GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5 [3].

An important component to extract clean top physics signals is the possibility to identify \(b\)- quarks. Both the LHC experiments ATLAS [3] and CMS [4] will have two or more Si-pixel layers at distances of 4 cm to 15 cm from the beam pipe. These layers will provide high granularity 3-dimensional reconstruction for \(b\)-quark tagging through detection of secondary vertices. Figure 1 shows the expected \(b\)-tagging capability of ATLAS, as obtained by counting the number of tracks in a jet with large impact parameter. A simplified simulation of the inner detector was used to obtain this figure, which shows that a rejection of at least 100 can be achieved against prompt jets (i.e. jets containing no long-lived particles) at low L for an efficiency of 50% for \(b\)-quarks. This is similar to what is expected from the CMS detector as well as to the performance obtained by the CDF experiment at the Tevatron Collider. The overall \(b\)-tagging efficiency can be increased to about 60% by identifying soft leptons produced in the semileptonic decays of the \(b\)-quarks, using the inner detector and the calorimeters [5]. At high luminosity the jet rejection would be reduced to about 40 (for the same \(b\) efficiency), if the innermost pixel layer were to be removed due to radiation damage.

## 2 Measurements of \(\sigma_{t\overline{t}}\) and m\({}_{top}\)

The measurement of the top production cross-section \(\sigma_{t\overline{t}}\) (similarly to the one presently performed at the Tevatron) is an interesting test of QCD. A deviation from the predicted value could be a signal for a non-Standard Model (SM) production mechanism. The largest uncertainties arise from those on the integrated luminosity, which at LHC should be of the order of 5-10%.

Regarding the top mass, it is important to define how well do we need to measure it. Two possible benchmarks can be the precision reached on the other quark masses (m\({}_{b}\) = 4.95 \(\pm\) 0.15 GeV) as well as the wish not to limit SM tests because of the poor knowledge of m\({}_{top}\). This suggests that \(\Delta\)m\({}_{top}\)\(\simeq\) 2 GeV is a reasonable goal.

### Measurement of m\({}_{top}\) using t\(\to jjb\) decays

This channel provides a high rate as well as the possibility to directly measure m\({}_{top}\) by reconstructing the 3-jets coming from the top hadronic decay. The background is due to fake electrons, \(b\overline{b}+\) jet and \(W+\) jet events. The high statistics at LHC will allow to reduce not only the statistical errors, but the systematics too, by applying tighter kinematical cuts [6]. One can i.e. require two high P\({}_{T}\) top-quarks, such that they decay in two distinct hemispheres. In this case the 3 jets from the hadronically decaying top will be very close in space and, as a consequence, the combinatorial background and the uncertainties coming from \(b\)-fragmentation and gluon radiation will be reduced since all the energy around the \(t\)-quark direction can be collected independently of any specific jet algorithm. Jet energies need however to be corrected for calorimeter non-linearity and other losses (cracks, leakage), energy out of the definition cone and energy entering the cone from the underlying event. It is important to notice that such sources of jet mismeasurements and most of the systematic uncertainties can be calibrated and estimated by using hadronic \(W\to jj\) decays. By requiring 3 jets with P\({}_{T}\)\(>\)40 GeV and \(|\eta|\)\(<\)2 opposite to the trigger lepton, and one jet tagged as a \(b\) one can obtain [6] the di-jet and three-jet masses (after correction) as shown in figure 2.

### Measurement of m\({}_{top}\) using leptons

The multi-lepton channels are characterised by a clean signal but lower statistics and also will allow an accurate measure of m\({}_{top}\). It is important to choose a kinematic variable which is sensitive to m\({}_{top}\) but as little as possible to P\({}_{T}^{top}\). The most promising technique seems to be the one which uses two leptons coming from the same \(t\) decay [7]. For a top mass of about 170 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), if one requires 2isolated leptons with P\({}_{T}\)\(>\)20 GeV and one non-isolated lepton with P\({}_{T}\)\(>\)15 GeV, about 15000 reconstructed events are expected (for an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)), which translate to a statistical error \(\Delta\)M\({}_{top}^{stat}\) of about \(\pm\) 0.5 GeV. The systematic error, which mainly arises from uncertainties on \(b\)-quark fragmentation and on the distribution of P\({}_{T}^{top}\) has been estimated to be \(\leq\)\(\pm\) 2 GeV.

## 3 Single top production

A signal from single top-quark production at LHC can be produced from either the \(W\)-gluon fusion process (92.4%), the Drell-Yan type process (4.3%) or the \(Wt\) production via \(gb\to W^{-}t\) (3.3%). For m\({}_{top}\simeq\) 170 GeV the expected cross-section for single-top production is about 20% of the \(t\overline{t}\) cross section. At a hadron collider the top-quark decay width \(\Gamma\) (\(t\to X\)) cannot be directly measured in the \(t\overline{t}\) sample [8], mainly due to QCD radiation. However, its main component can be accessed through single-top processes, since the single-top cross-sectionis directly proportional to the partial width \(\Gamma(t\to Wb)\). The constant of proportionality between the cross-section and the width has theoretical uncertainties originating in \(\alpha_{*}\), in the parton distribution functions and in the choice of Q\({}^{2}\) scale. This is an important measurement because it directly tests the \(t-b-W\) couplings. Until more detailed studies are performed, one can only crudely estimate that \(\Gamma(t\to Wb)\) could be measured to \(\pm\) 10% at LHC. In addition, assuming no anomalous couplings, the single-top cross-section provides a direct measurement of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element \(|V_{tb}|\). The uncertainty here comes essentially from the knowledge of the gluon distribution functions.

In the SM, the top-quark produced via the \(W\)-gluon fusion process is about one hundred percent longitudinally polarized. The asymmetry \(A\) can be defined as:

\[A=\frac{N(l^{+}\mbox{ {\it out of decay plane}})-N(l^{+}\mbox{ {\it into decay plane}})}{N(l^{+}\mbox{ {\it out of decay plane}})+N(l^{+}\mbox{ {\it into decay plane}})} \tag{1}\]

where N(\(l\)) indicates the lepton from \(W\) decay and the plane is the decay plane of the top. To measure this observable which is sensitive to CP-violation in

Figure 2: Left (L): Two–jet invariant mass distributions after requiring that the three-jet invariant mass be consistent with the \(t\) mass, for m\({}_{top}=\)150 (upper plot) and three–jet invariant mass distribution after requiring that the two–jet mass is consistent with the W mass (lower plot). Right (R): The same but for m\({}_{top}=\) 250 GeV.

top-quark decay [9] one needs to reconstruct the \(t\) and \(b\)-quark directions. It has been shown that it takes about \(10^{7}\)-\(10^{8}\) single-top events [10] to detect CP-violating effects of the order of \(\simeq 10^{-2}\)-\(10^{-3}\). Given that the CP-violating effects in \(b\)-physics can be understood to a systematic uncertainty of about 0.5% [11], and that with \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) about \(2\cdot 10^{7}\) single \(t\) (or \(\bar{t}\)) will be produced, one can optimistically hope that LHC would be able to probe CP-asymmetry in the single-top system at the level of a few percent.

## 4 Exotic top decays

A first look at exotic top-quark decays would come from the measurement of the \(t\to bW\) branching ratio (BR). The ratio of the di-lepton channel to the single-lepton channel cross sections is approximately equal to BR(\(t\to bW\)), assuming that this is the only significant decay mode in the SM. The background in the single-lepton channel is very large and can only be reduced to a few percent by requiring the additional signature of a \(b\) semileptonic decay. However, due to the present uncertainty on BR(\(b\to lX\)), this introduces an additional systematic uncertainty. The ultimate accuracy achievable for this cross-section ratio has been evaluated to be around 5% [7]. This accuracy would provide good sensitivity to possible \(t\to bH^{+}\) decays but not to rarer decay modes.

### \(t\bar{t}\to Hb\)\(Wb\)

This channel has been extensively studied [12]. The decay \(t\to H^{+}b\), if kinematically allowed, can compete with the \(t\to Wb\) decay. The charged Higgs production cross section has a minimum around \(5<\tan\!\beta<10\) ( where \(\beta\) is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets predicted by the given model, i.e. the Minimal Supersymmetric SM or MSSM). As \(\mbox{m}_{Higgs}\) increases the cross-section becomes asymptotically independent of \(\tan\!\beta\). The preferred decay mode of the charged Higgs is into a \(\tau\nu\) pair for \(\tan\!\beta>1\), and it's mass cannot be directly reconstructed due to the escaping neutrino. The signal would be observed as an excess (larger than 15% for all values of the parameters) of \(\tau\)'s in \(t\bar{t}\) events. This would either allow the discovery of the Higgs or the exclusion of the region \(\mbox{m}_{A}<140\) GeV (\(A\) being the neutral pseudoscalar predicted in the MSSM) for \(\mbox{m}_{top}=175\) GeV and for any \(\tan\!\beta\) (see figure 3, left plot).

### Rare decays

Other rare processes can be of interest. The \(t\to Zc\) decay is expected to occur at a very small rate in the SM. This channel is of interest since \(t\bar{t}\to ZZ+cc\) decays would be a serious background to events containing \(Z\)-boson pairs and jets. For \(t\bar{t}\to ZcWb(Z\to ll,W\to jj)\) one should reduce the background from _Zjjjj_ and _Zbbj_ by requiring the \(Z\to ll\) decay reconstruction, a mass m\({}_{Zj}\) within 8 GeV from m\({}_{top}\) and at least 3 jets (one of them from a \(b\)). A BR as small as 5\(\cdot\)10\({}^{-5}\) could be measured with an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). Another decay characterised by a BR (\(\simeq\)10\({}^{-3}\cdot\)10\({}^{-4}\)), which would probably be at the limit of the LHC experiment sensitivity is the \(t\to Ws\) one.

## 5 Top as a background for new physics

It is worthwhile to point out that, due to their high production rate, \(t\overline{t}\) events will be not only a source of exciting physics, but also the dominant background for many processes in both the strong symmetry breaking sector and the Higgs sector of the SM and MSSM. The inclusive production of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs is the main background to the \(WH\to l\nu b\overline{b}\) channel, \(t\overline{t}\gamma\gamma\) events may hide a signal from \(t\overline{t}H\) or \(WH\) with \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), and \(t\overline{t}\) pairs produced in association with jets are a serious source of background for the \(qq\to qqH\to WW+2\ jets\) processes. Let's look as an example, to the \(A\), \(H\to t\overline{t}\) process in the MSSM. This is the dominant decay for m\({}_{A,H}>2\cdot\) m\({}_{top}\) and small tan\(\beta\). Since in this case one would fully reconstruct \(t\overline{t}\) final states, the only background would be the \(t\overline{t}\) continuum. However, the reconstructed Higgs width will be large (between 30 and 80 GeV, depending on m\({}_{A,H}\)) and the expected S/B ratio small (between 2 and 10%) [12]. Therefore a precise knowledge (at the percent level) of the \(t\overline{t}\) cross-section as a function of the invariant mass is needed, which makes this one of the most difficult channels to be observed at LHC.

## 6 Conclusions

The LHC has a great potential for doing precision top physics. In one year of running at \(10^{32}\)-\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) a sample of \(t\bar{t}\) from 100 to 1000 times larger than that available at Tevatron will be collected. Most of the measurements will be limited by systematic uncertainties, and the top-quark mass in particular will be measured to better than \(\pm\) 2 GeV. The first observation of rare decays can come from LHC, and single top production can be detected as well.

Finally, top events will be the dominant background in many channels where to look for new physics. Here, the help from theory is needed, in order to reduce the uncertainties on the \(t\bar{t}\) continuum shape prediction.
