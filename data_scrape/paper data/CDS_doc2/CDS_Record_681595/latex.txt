A new very promising method for the top mass reconstruction in ATLAS is presented. The method uses a special sub-sample of the single lepton plus jet events where the top has high \(p_{T}\) (\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 200 GeV/\(c\)), available with acceptable statistics at LHC due to the high \(t\overline{t}\) production rate. The top mass is reconstructed as the invariant mass of all the calorimeter towers in a cone around the top quark direction. From studies made with both the fast and full detector simulation programs, it is shown that an accuracy of 1-1.5% in the reconstructed top quark mass can be achieved, using only one year's data at low luminosity of LHC (10\(fb^{-1}\)). A detailed study of the systematic errors involved with the measurement is discussed as well.

## 1 Introduction

Within the Standard Model, the top quark decays mainly into Wb, with the W boson decaying into a quark-anti-quark or lepton-neutrino pair. The study presented here uses the _"lepton+jets"_ channel of the \(t\overline{t}\) events, where one of the W bosons decays into a lepton (electron or muon)neutrino pair, and the other into a quark-anti-quark pair. This topology corresponds to 29.6% of the total \(t\overline{t}\) statistics, which combined with the large \(t\overline{t}\) production cross-section at LHC (about 830 \(pb\)[1]), results in about 2.5 million of such events per year at low luminosity 1. These events are easily triggered and selected due to the presence of the isolated lepton, the missing energy (due to the neutrino) and of the four jets. Tagging b-jets is also important to reduce background and combinatorics.

Footnote 1: For the startup phase, the LHC machine is scheduled to run at low luminosity (\(10^{33}\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)), with a total of \(10fb^{-1}\) per year.

Due to the large statistics available at LHC, it is possible to select sub-samples of the \(t\overline{t}\) events for specific studies with good statistics. For the top mass measurement (\(m_{top}\)) in particular, such a sub-sample is the **"high \(p_{T}\) sample"**, where the top and anti-top quarks are produced with sufficiently high \(p_{T}\), above 200 GeV/\(c\). In this topology, the two quarks are produced back-to-back, and the daughters from the two top decays appear in distinct hemispheres of the detector: the _"hadronic"_ one from the decay \(t\rightarrow\,\mathrm{W}b\to jjb\), and the _"leptonic"_ one from the decay \(t\rightarrow\,\mathrm{W}b\to l\nu b\). Due to the high \(p_{T}\) of the event, detector systematics as well as backgrounds from other processes are expected to be small. The distinct feature of these events which is exploited here is the fact that, due to the high \(p_{T}\), the three jets from the hadronic top decay tend to overlap in space. Therefore one could reconstruct the top mass not from the three jets as is usually the case [2, 3], but from summing up the individual calorimeter towers over a large cone (\(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) in the range [1.0-1.5]) around the top direction. The top direction itself can be determined in two ways: i) as opposite to the top direction reconstructed in the leptonic decay, where the missing energy in the event is used to reconstruct the neutrino, and ii) as the direction of the invariant mass of the three jets in the hadronic top decay. There in order to improve the efficiency the jets could be reconstructed using a small cone (\(\Delta\)R=0.2), since we are interested only in their direction and not their energy.

Direct summing of the calorimeter towers avoids problems with the jet reconstruction and energy calibration, particularly demanding in this topology. A different set of systematic errors is also involved, therefore very interesting and useful for the final combined top mass determination by ATLAS. For completeness, the "standard" top mass reconstruction using the invariant mass of the three jet system \(m_{jjb}\) like in the inclusive sample [4] is also studied.

The rest of this note is organized as follows: In the next section the event generation and preselection as well as the basic characteristics of the high \(p_{T}\) top sample are described. An attempt to reconstruct the top mass from the invariant mass of the reconstructed jets is discussed next. The limits of this approach to the resulting top mass accuracy, expected due to the particular topology of the high \(p_{T}\) of the event, are discussed. Following that, the top reconstruction using the calorimeter towers is described in detail. Two topics: the underlying event estimation and subtraction, and the top mass scale calibration (particularly important in this method) are discussed in detail. The studies for the systematic errors relevant to the top mass reconstruction are presented next. The note ends with a summary where a comparison with other top reconstruction methods in ATLAS is given. In all the sections the results from both the ATLFAST and full detector simulation are shown and discussed.

This note follows and extends the preliminary analysis discussed in the ATLAS Physics TDR [5].

## 2 The high \(p_{T}\) top sample

### Event generation and preselection

Samples of high \(p_{T}\)\(t\overline{t}\) events were generated using PYTHIA 5.7[6], with a cut of 200 GeV/\(c\) in the center of mass of the hard scattering. In addition, one of the Ws from the top quark decay was forced to decay leptonically to a \(\mu\nu_{\mu}\) pair. The cross-section of this topology given by PYTHIA is \(\sim 6.34\,pb\) per lepton flavour, corresponding to about 1% of the total \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section. For most of the studies, the parameterized "fast" ATLAS detector simulation program ATLFAST (version 2.30) is used [11]. In addition, a sample of 20000 events was passed from the GEANT-3/DICE98 [12] detector simulation code to its version (3.2) used for the Physics TDR. The latest available version 1.3.0 of the ATRECON program was used for the reconstruction. Jets were reconstructed using the standard fixed cone jet finder provided in ATLFAST and ATRECON, with a cone size of \(\Delta\)R=0.4. The summary Ntuples provided by the programs were used for the analysis.

As a first step, an event preselection was made. Events were selected if:

* the event passes the ATLAS trigger selection,
* there was an isolated muon with \(p_{T}\!>30\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|\!<2.5\),
* the missing energy of the event \(E_{T}^{m\,ss}\) was greater than 30 GeV/\(c^{2}\),
* there was at least four jets reconstructed using a cone of \(\Delta\)R=0.4 with \(p_{T}\!>40\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|\!<2.5\),
* from the reconstructed jets, two were required to be flagged as b-jets, using the ATLFAST tagging routines 2.

Footnote 2: Jets are flagged as b-jets if their direction lies within \(\Delta\)R\(<\)0.2 from the original b quark direction. A \(p_{T}\) independent 60 % tagging efficiency and a 10(1)% miss-tagging probability for c(u,d):jets is applied.

For the jets, the default energy calibration provided by the programs w as used. In Table 1 the effect of successive application of the selection cuts is shown. The overall efficiency is 9%, resulting in 15155 selected events per year at low luminosity, including the electron channel with similar efficiency. Due to the high \(p_{T}\) of the event and the requirement for two tagged b-jets, the background (mainly W+jet, WW or QCD events) is reduced to negligible levels and is therefore not discussed further.

### Event characteristics

The distinct features of the high \(p_{T}\) top sample are described here. In Figures 1 and 2 the \(p_{T}\) distribution, at parton level, for the top quark and the W boson (for the preselected events) are shown respectively. The W bosons have an average \(p_{T}\) of 175 GeV/\(c\).

In the reconstruction method presented here, the top quark mass is reconstructed as the invariant mass of the calorimeter towers around the top direction. It is therefore important to know at parton level, the spatial distance of the three quarks involved in the hadronic top decay: the two jets from the W, and the associated b-jet. In Figures 3 and 4 the \(\Delta\)R distance between the top and the corresponding b quark and W boson are shown. As expected due to the high \(p_{T}\) they are very close, with an average separation of 0.6 and 0.4 respectively.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|} \hline \hline
**Selection cut** & **efficiency** & **events** \\ \hline Produced & & 174,300 \\ ATLAS Trigger + Isolated muon & 80 \% & 139,127 \\ \(E_{T}^{miss}\)\(>\)30 GeV & 54 \% & 93,925 \\ \(\geq\) 4 reconstr. jets & 27 \% & 46,811 \\ \(\geq\) 2 b-tag jets & 9 \% & 15,847 \\ \(\geq\) 2 non b-tag jets (\(p_{T}\)\(>\)40 GeV/\(c\)) & 9 \% & 15,155 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: ATLFAST: Efficiencies and event rates (for 10\(fb^{-1}\)) after successive application of the event preselection cuts.

The \(\Delta\)R distance (at parton level) between the two quarks from the hadronic W decay is shown in Figure 5. For most of the events it is below 1.2, which indicates that energy sharing has to be taken into account in the jet energy measurement, as each jet would typically be reconstructed with a cone of \(\Delta\)R=0.4 or 0.7 for the low luminosity phase.

The \(\Delta\)R distance between the top parton direction and the furthest and closest quark from the W decay are shown in Figures 6 and 7 respectively.

As can be seen from the above distributions, for the majority of the events all three quarks and therefore the corresponding reconstructed jets, are contained within a cone of \(\Delta\)R=0.4-1.1 around the top direction. It is this feature which is exploited with the reconstruction method presented in this note.

## 3 High \(p_{T}\) top mass reconstruction using jets

For the events passing the selection cuts described above, the complete \(t\overline{t}\) topology was reconstructed. First, the hadronic W decay is reconstructed from the two highest \(p_{T}\) non b-tagged jets.

The resulting invariant mass distribution is shown in Figure 9, where a clear peak around the nominal mass is observed. Fitting the six bins around the peak with a gaussian, the resulting mean value is about 1 GeV lower than the nominal W mass (with a sigma of 5.3 GeV/\(c^{2}\)). This result was obtained even if the energy sharing algorithm has been considered in the jet energy measurement.

Selecting the events where \(m_{jj}\!=\!M_{\rm W}\!\pm\!20.0\) GeV/\(c^{2}\), results to an efficiency of 32%, with a purity of 64%. For each accepted \(jj\) combination, the jet energies were rescaled imposing the \(m_{jj}\!=\!M_{\rm W}\) constraint.

Next, the two jets were combined with the b-jet furthest from the isolated muon, in order to reconstruct the \(t\to jjb\) candidates. The high \(p_{T}\) top requirement was imposed by requiring \(p_{T}\)\((jjb)>23\) GeV/\(c\). After selection cuts, the overall signal efficiency was 2%, which results to a sample of \(\sim\)3600 events in this channel for 10\(fb^{-1}\), and the background from sources other than \(t\overline{t}\) was reduced to a negligible level. In Figure 9 the three jet invariant mass is shown. Fitting with a gaussian distribution in the region of \(\pm\) 2 \(\sigma\) around the peak, a top mass consistent but higher by 0.5 GeV/\(c^{2}\) from the generated value was found, with a sigma of 7.9 GeV/\(c^{2}\).

As we have seen in Section 2.2, for the majority of the events the three jets that are used to reconstruct the top mass are spatially very close. Therefore their energy has to be corrected to take into account the energy sharing in the calorimeter towers. In ATLFAST, the algorithm which is implemented assigns the energy of the shared calorimeter towers in proportion to the \(p_{T}\) of the jets. To test the efficiency of the algorithm as well as the jet energy calibration, the reconstructed top invariant mass was plotted versus the top \(p_{T}\), and the distance \(\Delta\)R between any of the jets involved. If the algorithms works well, no dependence would be observed.

In Figures 11 and 11 the variation of the reconstructed top \(p_{T}\) and invariant mass is shown, where for the latter, a variation of 2.3% is observed. Therefore, although the algorithm used for the top mass reconstruction and the jet energy calibration works reasonably well, there is a residual error due to the special event topology of the high \(p_{T}\) sample that limits the accuracy.

### Full Simulation results

Similar results were obtained with the full simulation events. Slightly broader distributions were observed with sigma of \(8.2(13.4)\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\) for two(three) jet invariant mass. This can be partially attributed to the jet calibration used and to the limited statistics available (Figures 12 and 13).

The same dependence of the reconstructed top mass (\(m_{jjb}\)) on the top or W \(p_{T}\), or the \(\Delta\)R distance between the jets as in the fast simulation is observed (Figure 14).

## 4 Top mass reconstruction using a large calorimeter cluster

To take advantage from the particular topology of the high \(p_{T}\) top sample, a special algorithm for the top mass reconstruction was developed. For the events passing the preselection cuts described in Section 2.1, the top quark direction was deteremined as described in Section 1. From the proposed methods described there, the second one was used as it gives better results, and can be applied to the available full simulated data sample 3. This part is similar to the standard method described above. First the hadronic W invariant mass was reconstructed from the two highest \(p_{T}\) non b-tag jets. Combinations where \(m_{jj}\)=\(M_{\rm W}\pm 20.0\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) were selected. Finally, the two jets were recombined with the nearest b-jet to reconstruct the top, which was required to have \(p_{T}\)\(>\)235.0 GeV/\(c\). After all the cuts 3600 events remained per 10\(fb^{-1}\).

Footnote 3: In the full simulation of the high \(p_{T}\) top sample, a limit was put to only trace particles with \(|\eta|\)\(\leq\)2.7, which has a significant impact on the missing energy calculation.

Once the top direction was determined, the invariant mass of all the calorimeter towers (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\)) around this direction was evaluated according to the formula:

\[m_{clust}^{2}(\Delta R)=(E^{2}-p^{2})=(\sum_{i=1}^{n(\Delta R)}E_{i})^{2}-( \sum_{i=1}^{n(\Delta R)}\vec{p}\,\,)^{2}.\]

where \(E_{i}\) is the total calorimeter energy in the i-th tower evaluated in electromagnetic scale, and \(\vec{p}_{i}\) is its three momentum vector. The index \(n(\Delta R)\) runs over all the towers within the selected cone radius. This invariant mass \(m_{clust}\) (hereafter called \(m_{clust}^{top}\)), is a measure of the generated top quark mass.

Figure 15 shows the reconstructed \(m_{clust}^{top}\) invariant mass for a cone size of \(\Delta\)R=1.3. A clear gaussian distribution is observed with peak value around the nominal top mass. Fitting the peak

region with a gaussian, we obtain a \(\sigma\) of 4.8 GeV/\(c^{2}\), comparable to that obtained with the jet method.

Figure 16 shows the purity of the selected event sample as a function of the \(\Delta\)R distance between the top quark direction and the three quarks of the \(t\to jjb\) decay. For \(\Delta\)R=1.3, more a purity of 80% is obtained, which increases to 90% for \(\Delta\)R\(\geq\) 1.6.

The invariant mass \(m^{top}_{d\,ust}\), was evaluated using various cone sizes in the range from \(\Delta\)R=0.9 to 1.8, as there is no reason a priori to select a given value. On the contrary, the resulting invariant mass has to be independent on the cone size used. For each \(\Delta\)R cone size, a gaussian was fitted around the peak position in the invariant mass \(m^{top}_{d\,ust}\) distribution. The fitted peak values for the different cone sizes are shown in Figure 17.

The variation observed (presented by the black triangles) can be attributed to the Underlying Event (UE) contribution which is added for each calorimeter tower, resulting to an increased invariant mass value as the cone size increases. A method to evaluate the UE contribution in each tower is described in the next section.

### The Underlying Event (UE) estimation

The Underlying Event contribution per calorimeter tower (UE\({}_{t\,ow\,er}\)) was estimated from the same high \(p_{T}\) top sample. It represents the average transverse energy \(E_{T}\) deposited per calorimeter tower in each event, once all the towers related with the high \(p_{T}\) products are excluded. The obtained values as well as the number of towers used in each case are shown in Table 2 for different rapidity regions. The \(\Delta\)R value indicates the isolation cut from the reconstructed jets in the event. Calorimeter towers within the selected value of \(\Delta\)R from any of the reconstructed jets of the event were flagged and not used in the UE estimation.

Averaging in all rapidity and isolation cut range within the calorimeter acceptance (\(|\eta|<3\)), a value of UE\({}_{t\,ow\,er}\)=447.5 MeV/\(c^{2}\) is obtained. This value is subtracted from the energy of each tower in the calculation of \(m_{clust}\). Figures 17 and 18 show the effect on the invariant mass \(m^{top}_{clust}\) after the UE\({}_{t\,ow\,er}\) is subtracted. The resulting values (the white crosses on Figure 18) are now independent of the cone size, with an average value of 159.1 \(\pm\) 0.11 GeV/\(c^{2}\) and with all values within \(\pm\)0.15%. This demonstrates that the UE contribution has been correctly estimated. Varying the UE\({}_{t\,ow\,er}\) by \(\pm\)10%, a cone size dependence is again observed, raising to a bit less than \(\pm\)2%. In ATLAS, once the real data become available, the UE\({}_{t\,ow\,er}\) can be calculated in situ from different event samples, like the top sample itself or Z+jets calibration events.

#### 4.2.2 Calibration using \(\mathrm{W}\) from the inclusive top sample

The last and most promising sample to obtain the \(m_{clust}^{top}\) rescaling is the inclusive _"lepton+jets"_ top sample. It offers high statistics, and has practically the same event topology as the high \(p_{T}\) sample in which we are interested. PYTHIA 5.7 was used to generate the events in the single lepton plus jets topology, similar to the one for the high \(p_{T}\) top sample, but with no \(p_{T}\) cut applied to the hard scattering process in this case. The event analysis was done with ATLFAST. The large statistics available allow application of tight cuts in order to select events where the two jets from the hadronic \(\mathrm{W}\) decay are close in space (as in the high \(p_{T}\) sample) and at the same time far away from the b-jet. Events were selected if they pass the following cuts:

* there is an isolated muon with \(p_{T}\!>20\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|\!|\!<\!\!2.5\),
* the missing energy of the event is \(E_{T}^{miss}\!>20\) GeV/\(c^{2}\),
* there are at least four jets in the event, reconstructed in a cone of \(\Delta\)R=0.4, that have \(p_{T}\!>40\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|\!|\!<\!\!2.5\),
* from the reconstructed jets, two are flagged as b-jets,
* the distance between the two highest non b-tagged jets (used to reconstruct the \(\mathrm{W}\) boson), should be \(\Delta\)R\(<\)1.3,
* the two b-jets of the event should be at a distance \(\Delta\)R\(\geq\)2.0 away from the reconstructed \(\mathrm{W}\) direction.

After the selection cuts were applied on a sample of one million of generated inclusive top events, the remained number of signal events is \(\sim\) 4000. The two highest \(p_{T}\) non b-tagged jets were used to reconstruct the \(\mathrm{W}\) and find its direction. Then, the \(m_{clust}^{\mathrm{W}}\) invariant mass was calculated as before. For each tower, the same UE\({}_{tow\,er}\) (obtained by using the high \(p_{T}\) top sample) was subtracted, anexample of the W invariant mass spectrum for \(\Delta\)R= 1.1, after UE subtraction, is shown in Figure 22. In Figure 22 the fitted values of the invariant mass \(m_{clust}^{\,\rm W}\) are shown before and after the UE\({}_{tower}\) subtraction. As before, almost no dependence on the cone size is observed, (variation within \(\pm 0.7\%\) for the whole range of cone values) however the average value is about \(7.68\,{\rm GeV}/c^{2}\) lower than the nominal W mass.

Extracting the calibration factor (\(C_{top}=1.106\)) and applying it to the high \(p_{\!\rm T}\) sample, we obtain much better results shown in Figure 23. As an example, for \(\Delta\)R=1.2(1.3) the \(m_{clust}^{top}\) invariant ant mass after the UE\({}_{tow\,er}\) subtraction was 158.9(159.0) GeV/\(c^{2}\), and after re-calibration becomes 175.7(175.8) GeV/\(c^{2}\). Table 3 summarizes the results.

Taking the average of the recalibrated \(m_{clust}^{\,top}\) invariant mass for all cone sizes, we obtain an \(m_{top}\) value of 175.86 \(\pm\) 0.12  GeV/\(c^{2}\), within 0.5% from the generated top quark mass of 175.0 GeV/\(c^{2}\).

The stability of the reconstructed top (\(m_{clust}^{\,top}\)) and W (\(m_{clust}^{\,\rm W}\)) masses was tested using 17 different event samples, each one corresponding to 10 \(fb^{-1}\). The complete analysis was performed in each sample, using the same UE\({}_{tow\,er}\) estimate. Figure 25 shows the distribution of \(m_{clust}^{\,top}\) obtained versus the \(\Delta\)R distance before the mass rescaling is applied, and Figure 25 is the \(m_{top}\) distribution obtained from all samples after mass rescaling. The average \(m_{top}\) is 175.45 \(\pm\) 1.52  GeV/\(c^{2}\).

### Full simulation results

A similar analysis as the one presented with ATLFAST was repeated with the sample of fully simulated events of the ATLAS detector. The main points of the analysis and in particular the ones that differ from the fast simulation are presented here.

Figure 27 shows the reconstructed invariant mass spectrum for a cone size of \(\Delta\)R=1.3. The variation of the fitted values for different cone sizes is shown in Figure 27. Although the peak values in this case are lower than those of ATLFAST, the overall variation for the same cone size range stays about the same. The difference between the fast and full simulation can be attributed to the shower shape development, which is not included in ATLFAST. In the full simulation we have many more calorimeter towers with lower energy each, while in ATLFAST the energy for each particle is deposited to a single tower.

The UE\({}_{tower}\) was evaluated following the same procedure as with the fast simulation data. The results are listed in table 4.

The average UE\({}_{tower}\) is now about 42.5 MeV/\(c^{2}\), much lower than the fast simulation but calculated over a much larger number of towers. This value was used for all the full simulation studies described below.

The invariant mass after the UE\({}_{tower}\) subtraction is shown in Figure 27 as a function of cone size used. As expected, the resulting fitted values remain basically independent from the cone size used, within a variation of \(\pm 0.3\%\) over the whole range of \(\Delta\)R. The average value is 132.76 GeV/\(c^{2}\), lower by 24.1% from the generated top quark mass.

To verify that the re-calibration procedure studied with the ATLFAST data works equally well in the full simulation, the most promising method of using the inclusive top sample was studied. A sample of 30,000 fully simulated inclusive events was used. The same cuts as in the fast simulation analysis described in section 4.2.2 were used. The W boson was first reconstructed using the jets, and then the invariant mass was calculated for several \(\Delta\)R values. In Figure 28 the invariantmass \(m_{ clust}^{\rm W}\) spectrum is shown, evaluated for cone size \(\Delta\)R=1.1. A gaussian is fitted around the peak. The fitted \(m_{ clust}^{\rm W}\) peak values for different values of \(\Delta\)R are shown in Figure 29, before and after the UE\({}_{ tower}\) subtraction.

As observed before, the resulting \(m_{ clust}^{\rm W}\) invariant mass after the UE contribution is subtracted, is independent from the cone size but 23.5% below the nominal W mass.

The rescaling factor was calculated in the same way (\(C_{top}=1.307\)), and applied to the reconstructed \(m_{ clust}^{top}\) invariant mass. The resulting values are constant within \(\pm 1\)% from the generated top quark mass, for the whole range of cone values (Figure 30). In Table 5 the values from the various fits are summarized.

Evaluating \(m_{ top}\) for the whole range of \(\Delta\)R, we obtain 173.26 \(\pm\) 0.19 \({\rm\,GeV}/c^{2}\), which is 1% below the generated top mass, with all points within \(\pm\) 0.5%. Restricting to the range up to \(\Delta\)R\(\leq\)1.4 the \(m_{ top}\) changes to 173.8 \(\pm\) 0.2 \({\rm\,GeV}/c^{2}\), with the points now having a spread of \(\pm\) 0.3 %.

In summary, the full simulation data show similar results as fast simulation, and confirm the competitiveness of the proposed reconstruction method.

## 5 Systematic errors

We have performed several studies which we believe cover most of the possible systematic errors, at least the ones that can be measured to a reliable way with the present simulation codes and knowledge of the detector. The various error sources studied can be categorized as follows:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\(m_{clust}^{\text{W}}\) (GeV/\(c^{2}\))} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\(m_{clust}^{top}\) (GeV/\(c^{2}\))} \\ \hline \(\Delta\)R & raw & UE subtr. & raw & UE subtr. & mass calibr. \\ \hline \hline

* errors related with the generator and the event topology in general,
* errors related with the reconstruction method,
* errors related with the detector.

The first two categories are mainly studied with the fast simulation program ATLFAST, since they require large samples of data with different parameters to be generated, something not easy to do with the full detector simulation. For the third case, the full detector simulation is used as a more precise description of the detector performance is necessary.

### Generator level studies

#### 5.1.1 Linearity of the reconstruction

Several samples of high \(p_{T}\) top events but with different input top quark mass in the generator from \(160\,\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\) to \(190\,\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\) were produced and analyzed in exactly the same way as explained before. For all the samples the UE energy estimate per calorimeter tower was kept the same, \(44\,7.5\,\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}\), as calculated before. For the \(m_{clust\,st}^{top}\) invariant mass, mass scale calibration values from the inclusive top sample (section 4.2.2) were used. The purpose of this exercise is to see if the reconstruction method is able to determine the input top mass, independently of its value. In Figure 31 the resulting top mass \(m_{top}\) in each sample is plotted versus the input top quark mass in the generator. A linear correlation with a slope of 1.0 is observed, which leads to a negligible error on the top quark mass estimation.

#### 5.1.2 Initial and final state radiation

The presence of initial state radiation (ISR) or final state radiation (FSR) can affect the measurement of the top mass. To study this, samples of high \(p_{T}\) top events were generated with the ISR

Figure 31: Reconstructed \(m_{top}\) invariant mass, as a function of the input top quark mass in the generator.

and/or FSR contributions switched off at the generator level in PYTHIA. The analysis, including the re-calibration factors \(C_{top}\) obtained from the W reconstruction in the top inclusive sample was repeated and keeping the UE\({}_{tower}\) the same. Since this is a very pessimistic approach, the error quoted is 20% of the reconstructed \(m_{top}\) invariant mass shift \(\Delta m_{t}\) observed between the previous values and the ones obtained in the samples with ISR(FSR) switched off. In principle, when the LHC data become available the ISR and FSR contributions could be measured more accurately than the present predictions of the generator currently having an uncertainty about 10% due to the error on the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}\).

In Table 6 the mass shifts and the corresponding errors are listed for one cone size. Not much variation is observed between the different cone sizes.

#### 5.1.3 b-quark fragmentation

In the reconstruction of the top mass, the b-jet tagging and energy reconstruction plays an important role. The b-quark fragmentation which controls the part of the b-quark momentum to might appear as visible energy is known to be different from that of light quarks and is parameterized in the generator with the Peterson formula [7] with a single parameter \(\epsilon_{b}\). Therefore the uncertainty of \(\epsilon_{b}\), currently about 0.0025 [8] will cause a difference in the energy measured (amount and distribution) in the calorimeters and thus an error in the reconstructed top mass. To study this effect, samples of high \(p_{T}\) events were generated with the \(\epsilon_{b}\) parameter changed at the generator level within its error. The top mass was reconstructed in each case using the same UE\({}_{tower}\) and re-calibration factor. As before, the shift in the top mass was measured and quoted as error. As an example, for a cone size of \(\Delta\)R = 1.3 the mass shift was 0.3 GeV/\(c^{2}\), with similar values obtained for other cone sizes.

### Reconstruction method studies

#### 5.2.1 Underlying event estimation

One of the most important points in the top mass reconstruction method is the evaluation of UE\({}_{tower}\). To evaluate the sensitivity of the reconstructed mass on this quantity, the following method was used: The energy estimated per cell, 447.5 MeV/\(c^{2}\) for ATLFAST and 42.5 MeV/\(c^{2}\) for the full simulation, was varied by 10 % 4 and the top mass \(m_{top}\) was recalculated. In order to have consistent results, the reconstruction of the W boson in the inclusive sample was repeated, and new rescaling factors were calculated each time. The results are shown in Figures 3.2 and 3.3. The reconstructed top mass remains within \(\pm\)1(1.2)% to the generated value after the re-calibration is applied, in the fast and full simulation samples respectively.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline \hline  & \(|\Delta m_{t}|\) ( GeV/\(c^{2}\)) & \(\delta m_{t}\) ( GeV/\(c^{2}\)) \\ ISR on/off & 0.7 & 0.1 (2)\% \\ FSR on/off & 0.3 & 0.1 (2)\% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

#### 5.2.2 Calorimeter non-compensation

Since the reconstruction method discussed here works directly with the calorimeter towers (calibrated to the electromagnetic scale), a possible contribution to the systematic error might come from the different response of the calorimeter(s) to hadrons or electrons. From tests with the calorimeter prototypes it has been seen that the combined \(e/h\), is different from 1.0 [13]. In addition in both ATLFAST and GEANT-3 programs used for the detector simulation, the \(e/h\) effect on the calorimeters is not correctly simulated [14].

Figure 33: Same as in Figure 32 but for the full simulation sample.

Figure 32: Variation of the reconstructed \(m_{clust}^{\mathrm{W}}\) and \(m_{clust}^{top}\) invariant masses for 10% change of the UE energy estimate per calorimeter tower. Left: variation on the \(m_{clust}^{\mathrm{W}}\) mass. Right: Variation on the \(m_{clust}^{top}\) mass after the UE subtraction and after the rescaling is applied.

To study this, the fast simulation (ATLFAST) samples were used. The energy deposited by hadrons has been corrected according to Groom's formula [9]:

\[e/\pi(E)=\frac{e/h}{1-(1-e/h)<f_{\pi^{0}}(E)>}\]

being,

\[<f_{\pi^{0}}(E)>=1-(E/E_{0})^{m-1}\]

where \(<f_{\pi^{0}}(E)>\) is the average fraction of the energy that goes into \(\pi^{0}\)s in the hadronic shower, and \(E_{0}\) is a constant, around \(1\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\). Several values of \(e/h\) were tried and the whole analysis, including the evaluation of the UE energy per tower was repeated for each time. In Table 7 the values obtained for the UE energy estimate for different values of \(e/h\) are shown. An overall 6.7% variation is observed when the \(e/h\) changes from 1.00 to 1.63, which is perhaps a bit high for the ATLAS calorimeters.

In Figures 35 and 35 the reconstructed \(m_{clust}^{top}\) invariant mass is shown for different values of \(e/h\), before and after the UE\({}_{four\,er}\) subtraction and re-calibration using the Ws in the inclusive top sample. After rescaling, the top mass \(m_{clust}^{top}\) stays within \(\pm 1\%\) from the generated mass over the full range of \(e/h\) values up to 1.63. Although this is a very positive result, attention should be paid to the fact that Groom's formula does not work well for low energies, therefore we might have additional effects between the UE range and the high \(p_{T}\) part, which may result in a bigger error. Such effects are difficult to evaluate with the simulation programs without the real data, so the error quoted is our best estimate for the moment.

### Detector effects

#### 5.3.1 Calorimeter mis-calibration

In a similar way as the UE estimate error, the effect of possible mis-calibration in the calorimeter towers was studied in the fast simulation sample: The energy registered in each tower was varied according to a gaussian with different values of sigma from 1 to 5%. The top and W reconstruction were repeated each time and the error quoted represents the shift observed in the reconstructed top mass between the case of no effect and with 1(5)%. The results are summarized in Table 8. It has to be noted that this error is a conservative estimate, while the aim is for 1% cell calibration using real data.

#### 5.3.2 Effect of electronic noise

The effect of the electronic noise to the top reconstruction was studied using the fully simulated data. In ATRECON the electronic noise is added as gaussian noise to the cell energies according to the especification [15, 16] for each calorimeter.

5\% & \(1.2\,\mbox{GeV}/c^{2}\) & \(1.3\,\mbox{GeV}/c^{2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Moreover, it is possible to apply a symmetric cut around zero to the resulting values to reject noise or very low energy cells without adding a bias to the overall energy measurement. For our analysis we decided not to apply this cut and use all the calorimeter cells. As before, the complete analysis was repeated, including the reevaluation of \(\mathrm{UE}_{tower}\).

Adding the electronic noise the \(\mathrm{UE}_{tower}\) changes from \(42.5\,\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}\) to \(16\,\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}\). In Figures 36 and 37 the effect of the electronic noise to the reconstructed \(m_{clust}^{\mathrm{W}}\) and \(m_{clust}^{top}\) invariant mass values is shown. After rescaling, the \(m_{clust}^{top}\) mass, remains constant within \(\pm 1.2\%\) for the full range of cone sizes used between 0.9 and 1.6 (Figure 38), with the average value being \(1.2\,\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\) lower than the generated top mass.

### Summary on systematic errors

Table 9 summarizes the systematic errors evaluated for the top mass in both the ATLFAST and full simulated high \(p_{T}\) top samples.

When results are available from both the fast and full detector simulation samples, the highest value is taken.

## 6 Conclusions

A new method for the top mass reconstruction in ATLAS has been presented. The method uses a special sub-sample of the single lepton plus jet events where the top has high \(p_{T}\) (\(p_{T}\!>\!200\) GeV/\(c\)), available with reasonable statistics only at LHC due to the high \(t\overline{t}\) production rate.

The chosen sub-sample has a distinct topology which is exploited with the proposed reconstruction algorithm. After some preselection of the events the top direction is determined using the 3-vectors of the reconstructed jets in the event, around which all the calorimeter towers within a radius \(\Delta\)R are summed and their invariant mass \(m_{\it clust}^{\it top}\) is calculated. A range of values for the \(\Delta\)R from 0.8 to 1.8 is used in order to have accumulated all the energy from the top decay products.

With increasing radius \(\Delta\)R, the calculated invariant mass increases as more of the UE energy is added to it. To correct this, a method to evaluate the mean energy from the UE event per calorimeter tower was developed, which was tested in the top events and gave very good results. After the UE contribution is subtracted the \(m_{\it clust}^{\it top}\) invariant mass remains independent of the cone size used to 1-1.5% level.

Next that, to calibrate the \(m_{\it clust}^{\it top}\) mass, to the top quark mass value, the same method was applied the reconstruction of the W boson in its hadronic decays and to transfer the resulting calibration to the top. Several event samples were studied, with the one giving the best results being the reconstruction of the hadronic W decay in the top sample itself. After rescaling, the obtained top mass is 175.86 \(\pm\) 0.12 GeV/\(c^{2}\), which stays within \(\pm\)0.5% from the nominal top mass.

A careful study of the possible systematic errors in the measurement was performed. Both ATLFAST and GEANT simulation data were used and various error contributions were calculated. From the results obtained, all the errors stay below the 1% level around the top mass. The expected accuracy can be achieved even with one year's data at low luminosity, corresponding to 10\(fb^{-1}\).

We have to stress that this analysis is unique to LHC. It gives very promising results, but we must also say that it relies heavily on the performance of the calorimeters. Energy scale calibration, uniformity and noise contribution can be the dominant factors if the expected behaviour is not met. However, as the method relies entirely on real data, there are many handles and cross-checks that can be made to achieve the performance presented here. Finally, as this technique has an almost orthogonal set of systematics with the "standard" jet method, it is an important component to the final top mass determination in ATLAS.
