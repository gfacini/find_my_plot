###### Abstract

The precise measurement of the momentum of hadrons in the tracking detectors, compared to the energy \(E\) measured in the calorimeters can provide a validation of the hadronic calibration of the response of the calorimeter to pions at the percent level. The \(E/p\) ratio allows the validation of the absolute energy scale calibration over the pseudorapidity range covered by the tracking detectors. Since the selected hadrons are mainly pions, the results obtained for pion response from test beam data are almost directly comparable. The single hadron \(E/p\) performances are studied using minimum bias events.

The tracking system can be used to verify the hadronic calorimeter calibration in the energy range between 400 MeV and 200 GeV. The inner tracking will be able to reach a 1% precision on the transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), with a few months of data taking at low luminosity. The energy over momentum, \(E/p\), ratio allows the validation of the absolute energy scale calibration over the pseudorapidity range of the tracking detectors which covers the Barrel Tile Calorimeter (\(|\eta|<\)1), the Extended Barrel Tile Calorimeter (1\(<|\eta|<\)1.7) and the Liquid Argon Hadronic Endcap Calorimeter up to \(|\eta|\)=2.5. Furthermore, since the selected hadrons are almost exclusively pions, the results obtained for pion response from test beam data are almost directly comparable.

The energy range for which the hadronic calibration must be checked can be determined by jet fragmentation studies at the generator level. It is instructive to investigate the lowest energy needed to obtain a given fraction of the jet energy, denoted \(x\). For this reason, it is useful to define the lowest energy jet particles (LEJPs). Using the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)  jet in QCD dijet events, the lowest energy jet particles (LEJPs) are determined by ordering in energy the stable particles (\(c\tau>10\) mm) in the jet. Starting with the highest energy, the particle energies are summed up until a fraction \(x\) of the jet energy is reached. The particle that pushes this sum over the threshold is the LEJP. Figure 1 shows the mean LEJP energy for a value of \(x=0.95\) as a function of the jet energy for central (\(|\eta|<1.5\)) and endcap (\(1.5<|\eta|<3.2\)) jets. To reconstruct 95% of the jet energy in the central region we have to measure particle energies down to 800 MeV. To reconstruct 99% of the jet energy we need to reach energies down to 200 MeV. The energy of the highest energy particle in the jet ranges from 10 GeV to 550 GeV.

Any hadronic calibration scheme is required to be robust over the energy range 200 MeV to 550 GeV to ensure the correct jet energies scale. Furthermore a large fraction of particles in jets have energy below 10 GeV and a large proportion of them are charged pions. Hence it is important to check the hadronic calibration at low particle energies using the \(E/p\) method. The robustness of the hadronic calibration, the validity of the hadronic shower model in Monte Carlo, and the single charged hadron \(E/p\) performance can be studied in several data samples which cover different energy ranges. The minimum bias sample can reach down to a momentum of 400 MeV and the remainder of this note deals with studies of \(E/p\) in the minimum bias sample.

## 2 Study of \(E/p\) using Minimum Bias events

As discussed above, low energy hadrons carry a large portion of the energy in a jet. It is therefore important to study the \(E/p\) performance at low energies to obtain an ultimate calibration of the jet energy scale to 1% precision. In early data, when a precise hadronic calibration will not be available, this study will be performed using the electromagnetic scale. Subsequently, each step of the local hadronic calibration can be cross-checked and improved. These steps include removal of noise via the use of topological clusters, cluster classification as electromagnetic or hadronic, and calibration of hadronic clusters to the local hadronic energy scale.

Minimum bias samples were used to determine the feasibility of using charged hadrons in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range between 1 to 10 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) to cross-check the single hadron energy scale for topological clusters calibrated to the local hadronic energy scale [1]. The simulation used for this study replicates data collected over only a few days at a trigger bandwidth of 10 Hz. A year of data-taking at low luminosity will reduce the statistical uncertainty to less than 1%. The data collected in one year should allow the local hadronic calibration to be checked as a function of both \(\eta\) and \(\phi\).

The calibration of topological clusters calibrated to the local hadronic energy includes corrections for invisible and escaped energy in the hadronic shower as well as energy lost in dead material, such as the material of the inner detector. It does not include corrections for energy lost in cells outside the cluster (out-of-cluster). In the very low energy regime considered by this study, there are significant energy losses in dead material and from out-of-cluster effects. Even with cluster calibration, it is not possible to completely recover these losses, since many low energy particles do not leave sufficient energy in the calorimeter to meet the cluster reconstruction thresholds. As a consequence, we expect the calibrated value of \(\langle E/p\rangle\) to be below 1. However, as \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) increases, these energy losses diminish and therefore \(\langle E/p\rangle\) approaches 1. Measuring the \(E/p\) distributions for single hadrons can provide a way of determining the size of these energy losses in-situ. It can also be directly compared to the single pion Monte Carlo used to derive the weights and cluster classification used as part of the local hadronic calibration.

### Isolated pions in Minimum Bias events

To eliminate fake tracks and ensure an accurate momentum measurement, only tracks satisfying the following criteria were considered in this study:

* At least one hit in the B Layer of the pixel detector.
* No more than one missing hit in the other pixel and SCT layers.
* Good quality track fit satisfying \(\chi^{2}/\mathrm{ndof}<1.5\).

Approximately 76% of all reconstructed tracks pass these criteria. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range for pions surviving the track quality constraints is given by the dashed curve in Fig. 2. This shows that minimum bias events can provide a source of pions to check the hadronic energy scale from 500 \(\mathrm{Me\kern-1.0ptV}\), the nominal lower energy required for a reconstructed track, up to energies of the order 10 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\).

The pion energy deposited in the calorimeter is found by extrapolating the track direction to the second sampling layer of the EM calorimeter. From this position a cone is defined, \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{cone}}=1.0\), and the energy of each charged hadron is calculated as the sum of all topological clusters within this cone. A topological cluster is considered to be inside the cone if its barycenter is within this \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{cone}}=1.0\) around the extrapolated track position.

In minimum bias events, energy from the underlying event inside the region defined by \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{cone}}\) considerably biases the measured pion energies. Photons originating from the decay of neutral pions are thepredominant source of background. Charged particles also contribute to the background as the reconstruction efficiency of tracks below 5  can be lower than 80% [2]. Selection criteria were used to reduce the contamination from the underlying event. These criteria differ slightly for charged hadrons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\leq 3\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>3\) due to the low multiplicity of higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) tracks in the event and the different hadronic shower shapes in the calorimeter. The selection criteria used to minimise the amount of energy from the underlying event are:

* Isolated from other tracks by at least \(\Delta R=0.4\). The track positions were taken at the second layer of the EM calorimeter.
* The charged hadron must be one of the harder particles in the event.
* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}/\sum_{\mathrm{all\ tracks}}p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.1\) for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\leq 3\) GeV.
* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}/\sum_{\mathrm{all\ tracks}}p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.3\) for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>3\) GeV.
* The energy in the hadronic calorimeter must be isolated by requiring the energy in the outer region \(0.4<\Delta R_{\mathrm{cone}}<1.0\) of the cone to be small.
* \(E_{\mathrm{HAD}_{1.0-0.4}}<0.01\times p_{\mathrm{track}}\) for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\leq 3\) GeV.
* \(E_{\mathrm{HAD}_{1.0-0.4}}<0.05\times p_{\mathrm{track}}\) for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>3\) GeV.

Figure 3 shows the \(E/p\) distribution in minimum bias events before and after cuts, and compares it to single pions. All results shown here and in Section 2.2 are for tracks associated with real pions (studies of the impact of non-pion tracks are in progress). These selection criteria approximately halve the shift in caused by other particles in the cone.

The shift of caused by the selection is primarily due to the isolation cut in the hadronic calorimeter. The shift was estimated using the pion from single particle Monte Carlo and was found to change by 0.006 for 1 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) pions, 0.002 for 2 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) pions, negligible for 5 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) pions and 0.001 for 10 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) pions. The remaining background, due to energy from the underlying event, cannot be removed with cuts. This is justified by the absence of isolated charged hadrons in minimum bias events.

### Data-driven unfolding procedure

The remaining background, present inside the region defined by \(\Delta R_{\rm cone}\), was estimated using a data-driven method described in Ref. [3]. This was then unfolded from the pion \(E/p\) distribution. Most of the energy coming from the underlying event is deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Charged pions which deposit most of their energy in the hadronic calorimeter were therefore selected in order to estimate the energy contamination in the electromagnetic calorimeter. These are labelled as late showering pions.

The energy from the underlying event was studied by dividing \(\Delta R_{\rm cone}\) into the following two regions:

* A region where very little background energy is deposited, consisting of:
* The hadronic calorimeter and
* A core region close to the track:
* \(\Delta R_{\rm core}=0.1\) for \(p_{\rm T}\leq 3\) GeV.
* \(\Delta R_{\rm core}=0.05\) for \(p_{\rm T}>3\) GeV.
* A ring surrounding the assumed trajectory of the pion through the electromagnetic calorimeter contains energy of the underlying event, \(E_{\rm outer-cone}\), defined to be \(\Delta R_{\rm core}<\Delta R<1\) in the electromagnetic calorimeter.

We use the energy in the \(E_{\rm outer-cone}\) of late-showering pions to estimate the underlying event energy. For this study we assume that the energy in \(E_{\rm outer-cone}\) for late-showering charged particles is zero as they

is used to examine the shift caused by any remaining contamination or by the method itself. Results are shown in Table 1. The \(E/p\) values are consistent with the single particle mean, showing that this procedure is promising. However, larger statistics are required to properly assess the ultimate precision of this method.

We compared charged hadrons in minimum bias Monte Carlo events of \(p_{\rm T}=0.8-1.2\) GeV, \(1.6-2.4\) GeV, \(4-6\) GeV and \(8-12\) GeV with single pion samples of 50 000 events generated with \(p_{\rm T}=1\) GeV, 2 GeV, 5 GeV and 10 GeV. As both minimum bias and single particle simulations are done with the same detector geometry and showering model, the \(E/p\) distributions are identical, providing a way to test how well we can retrieve the single pion \(E/p\) distribution in minimum bias events.

Both positive and negative pions were used, and the results were combined to improve the statistical precision. Due to limited Monte Carlo statistics, here we bin only in \(p_{\rm T}\). Ultimately, the \(E/p\) response

will be studied in bins of both energy and pseudorapidity, because the dead material distribution varies dramatically across \(|\eta|\). In minimum bias events, the mean charged particle multiplicity is relatively flat in \(\eta\) for a given \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Single particle samples are weighted to have the same \(|\eta|\) distribution as minimum bias tracks.

### Sources of systematic uncertainties

We studied a number of effects which biased the \(E/p\) distribution. In our study we assumed that all charged hadrons were pions. In minimum bias events, about 75% of all charged particles are pions, with a small number of kaons and protons. Less than 2% of the tracks are due to heavier hadrons, electrons, muons or are fake. However, the mix of particle types is different for late-showering hadrons. Biases arising from this different particle mixture were studied by comparing the \(\langle E/p\rangle\) calculated using all track types with the \(\langle E/p\rangle\) derived frompion tracks alone. Within the available statistical precision, we can put an upper limit of 10% on the shift. We use the energy in the \(E_{\mathrm{outer-cone}}\) of late-showering pions to estimate the contaminating energy. For this study we assume that the energy in \(E_{\mathrm{outer-cone}}\) for late-showering charged particles is zero as they act as mips through the electromagnetic calorimeter. This assumption translates to a shift on \(\langle E/p\rangle\) of less than 4%. The energy from the underlying event in the hadron calorimeter and in the \(\Delta R_{\mathrm{core}}\) region cannot be measured by this in-situ method. The shift of the \(\langle E/p\rangle\) due to this background is estimated using single pions and was found to be less than 4%. The uncertainty in the energy scale is dominated by the unmeasured contaminating energy and the effect of non-pion tracks. All the above systematic uncertainties are statistically dominated.

## 3 Conclusions

Jet fragmentation studies show that low energy hadrons carry a large portion of the energy in a jet. This study shows that isolated charged hadrons produced in minimum bias events can be used to study the \(E/p\) performance in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range from 1 to 10 GeV to obtain an ultimate calibration of the jet energy scale. This sample will provide an in-situ test of the cluster level hadronic calibration down to 1 GeV. Within a year at low luminosity, it will be possible to reduce the statistical uncertainty to less than 1%.

With the available Monte Carlo statistics we obtained a statistical uncertainty of 10% at 2 GeV which goes down to 3% at 10 GeV, mostly dominated by the statistics of the late showering pion control sample. Systematic biases from several sources have been studied. Effects, such as unpredicted detector inhomogeneities, will be studied once data are available.
