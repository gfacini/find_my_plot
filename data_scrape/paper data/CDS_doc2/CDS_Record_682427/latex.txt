For Higgs masses larger than the reach accessible to the \(H\to ZZ\to 4l\) channel, the decay channel \(H\to ZZ\to ll\nu\bar{\nu}\) has to be considered. On one hand this channel benefits from a larger rate (six times higher than for \(H\to ZZ\to 4l\) ) but suffers on the other from incomplete kinematical reconstruction, because of the two undetected neutrinos. This channel has a distinct signature: two high-\(P_{T}\) leptons from one Z boson decay and a large missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}\). Fundamental to this measurement is the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) performance of the calorimeters. In this note are described the results obtained using full simulation of a large sample of Z+jet events, in order to study the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) performance of the ATLAS calorimetry. The chosen geometry is the one described in the Technical Proposal and simulated according to the ATLAS note SOFT-NO-16.

## 2 Signal and backgrounds

\(E_{T}^{miss}\) mis-measurements may be caused by the presence in the detector of inefficient \(\eta-\phi\) regions (cracks) and by non gaussian tails in the energy reconstruction, usually due to losses of energy in passive material. This study concentrates mainly on understanding the effect of the crack region between the barrel and extended barrel parts of the tile calorimeter.

The expected spectrum of missing transverse energy (generated and reconstructed) is shown in Fig. 1 for \(H\to ZZ\to ll\nu\bar{\nu}\) decays with \(m_{H}=900\) GeV. This figure shows that, as expected, the generated \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is quite large ( it should display a Jacobian peak close to half of the Higgs mass), the difference between reconstructed and generated \(E_{T}^{miss}\) has an r.m.s. of about 40 GeV, much smaller than the average \(E_{T}^{miss}\) of about 400 GeV. This signal spectrum has to be compared to that of the competing backgrounds for \(E_{T}^{miss}\) values larger than 100 to 200 GeV.

The various background sources have been discussed previously for the ATLAS letter of Intent, based on particle level simulations (PHYS-NO-007). According to those studies, the main contribution comes from the irreducible \(ZZ(ZW)\to ll\nu\nu\) continuum for \(E_{T}^{miss}>150\) GeV. The irreducible background cross-section is comparable to that of the signal. The uncertainties on these backgrounds are quite large. In particular recent calculations of QCD corrections have shown that substantial increases of the cross-sections at large \(p_{T}\) are expected for Ws and Zs, a factor of about 2 for ZZ and a factor of about 5 for ZW.

Below 150 GeV of \(E_{T}^{miss}\), the Z+jet channel is the dominant background, even in the absence of instrumental effects. In practice, this background will most likely consist of jets, which are either not fully contained in the detector (because of escaping neutrinos or holes in the calorimeter acceptance) or are mis-measured in the calorimeters. This background channel has a very large cross-section and it was therefore decided to evaluate it carefully using full detector simulation.

## 3 Z+jet background

A large sample of Z+jet events was generated and processed through the DICE GEANT simulation of the full detector. In order to save CPU time, only \(Z\rightarrow\mu\mu\) decays were considered. The reconstruction of the two muons was assumed to be perfect, since its quality is irrelevant for the study presented here. The \(E_{T}^{miss}\) was calculated first from the calorimeter information, adding the vector components of the energy reconstructed in each readout cell, but ignoring individual cell noise and thresholds. In a second step, the momenta of all muons inside the detector acceptance were added and the missing transverse energy vector was correspondingly modified.

Four different samples of events were generated and processed, in order to better study particular geometrical regions such as the calorimeter cracks and topologies with lower rate (i.e. high \(p_{T}\) Z-bosons).

* 6182 Z+jet events, where the jet has \(E_{T}\) larger than 100 GeV and \(\mid\eta\mid<\) 2. The total cross-section on tape is 8.7 fb (tape LH0328). The events processed through full simulation are stored on 40 different CERN IBM (200 Mbytes) tapes. This sample is labelled in the following as sample A. If one event from this sample results in large reconstructed \(E_{T}^{miss}\), it will account for 141 events for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\).
* 1050 Z+jet events, generated with the highest \(P_{T}\) jet in the crack region between barrel and extended barrel 0.9 \(>\mid\eta\mid<\) 1.3 and \(P_{T}>\) 100 GeV. The total cross section is 1.8 fb on tape LH0325. The events processed through full simulation are stored on 7 different CERN IBM(200 Mbytes) tapes. This sample is labelled in the following as sample B. If one of such event produces a tail in the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution, it will account for 172 events for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\).
* 1000 Z+jet events generated with the same cuts as sample A, but with a minimal \(P_{T}\) requirement on the jet of 200 GeV. The label for this sample is Ahigh and the total cross section on tape is 1.25 fb. One event of this sample will correpond to 125 events at an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\). The starting tape is LH0327.
* 1150 Z+jet events generated with the same cuts as sample B, but with a minimal \(P_{T}\) requirement on the jet of 200 GeV. The label for this sample is Bhigh and the total cross section is 0.25 fb. One event of this sample will correpond to 22 events at an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\). The starting tape is LH0326.

## 4 Calorimeter calibration

The calibration of the various calorimeters was performed in several successive steps. First, all electromagnetic (EM) calorimeters, including the preshower, have been calibrated as a function of rapidity using single electrons and photons. The hadronic compartments were then calibrated through a single additional calibration constant for each hadronic calorimeter (Tile barrel, Tile extended barrel, LAr hadronic end cap, forward calorimeter), which corresponds to the sampling fraction factor. The calibration of the EM sections for jets is the same as for EM showers. The linearity for jet energy measurements is affected by the imperfect compensation in the ATLAS calorimeters. It was approximately restored by an average and energy independent calibration factor common to all EM and hadronic sections. This procedure works reasonably well for energies reconstructed in EM or hadronic clusters by the standard ATRECON cluster and jet finders. For cells which do not belong to such clusters, a similar calibration procedure is applied, this time using the single tower information.

Fig. 2 shows how well this calibration works over the whole eta coverage of the calorimeters. Even if very crude this method provides a reasonable calibration and a reasonable energy scale for our purposes. Deviations from linearity are affecting mostly the high eta regions, where the LAr calorimetersare less compensating. In the central region (Tile calorimeter), up to eta=1.5 the linearity is preserved at the 5% level. For single and two jet events above 20 GeV, the calibration is good. The problems arise from the low energy response of the calorimeters. Detailed studies which include software compensation will be needed for a better performance.

## 5 Results

Fig. 3 shows the reconstructed \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectra for all events from the various samples of Z+jet events. Fig. 4 shows these events with \(E_{T}^{miss}\) larger than 100 GeV (sample A and B) and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) larger than 200 GeV (sample Ahigh and Bhigh). These events are those which could potentially increase considerably the background to the Higgs signal, and their origin must therefore be understood.

### Instrumental effects

One reason for possible energy mis-measurment in the calorimeter could be energy loss fluctuations in dead materials of cryostats and other support structures; for details see the ATLAS note SOFT-NO-16.

Fig. 5 which shows the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) contribution arising from energy deposited in dead material, proves that this effect is not important. In fact no correlation is observed between the transverse energy lost in dead materials and the reconstructed missing energy spectrum. In addition sampleB, generated with jets pointing into the barrel endcap crack region, does not show more tails than sample A.

Fig. 6 shows the rapidity distribution of the reconstructed jets with highest \(E_{T}\) for all events (top) and only for the events with \(E_{T}^{miss}\) larger than 100 GeV. No obvious correlation is observed in this case either between a large reconstructed \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and the rapidity of the reconstructed jets. Even if in the crack region (around 0.9 to 1.2 in rapidity) good energy reconstruction is not obvious.

### \(E_{T}^{miss}\) from physics

Fig. 7 shows a clear correlation between large reconstructed \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and a significant \(E_{T}\) carried away by neutrinos. All events with \(E_{T}^{miss}\) greater than 150 GeV can be accounted by neutrinos, which are associated to jet or jets produced in association with the Z boson, and therefore most likely associated to semileptonical decays of heavy quarks.

In Fig. 8 the final result is presented, as the expected number of events with \(E_{T}^{miss}\) larger than \(E_{T}^{th}\) as a function of \(E_{T}^{th}\) at an integrated luminosity of \(10^{8}pb^{-1}\). The dark circles represent the results for samples A, the open squares the results for samples B. For both cases the results from full simulation agree well with the predictions at parton level. The dash-dotted curve shows the irreducible rate expected from all Z+jet events (parton level calculation). Within the limited statistics the residual Z+jet background is dominated by neutrinos and well below the irreducible background for \(E_{T}^{miss}\)\(>150\) GeV.

### Conclusions and future plans

The conclusion that can be drawn from the present study is that the crack region causes no severe problems for this Higgs channel. Inside our statistics no particular sign of degradation in the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectrum can be imputed to the detector geometry or the dead material in the cracks. Of course these studies have to be pursued, particularly to increase the statistics and monitor possible problems, which might arise as the cracks develop towards more realistic descriptions experimentally and as more knowledge on the true amount and nature of the dead material becomes available.
