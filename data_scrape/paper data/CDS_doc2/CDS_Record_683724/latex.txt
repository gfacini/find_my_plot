**Abstract**

In this note a commercial laser system for the monitoring of the correct placement of the MDT drift tube end-plugs on the assembly combs is described. The results of various tests are presented; the sensitivity of the system is well matched to the required mechanical accuracy in the MDT chambers construction. We propose this method for QA/QC during tube layers assembling.

## 1 Introduction

The basic element of the MDT assembly procedure is the construction of individual layers of drift tubes up to \(\sim\)2 m wide (\(\sim\)60 tubes); these layers are then stacked together with the help of a support structure (the spacer or the stiff-back) to form a multilayer.

The chamber mechanical accuracy is largely based on the precision with which the end-plugs of the individual tubes are positioned on the precision combs at the edges of the assembly jig. A Quality Control procedure on this positioning is therefore mandatory in order to guarantee the production of MDT chambers according to the requested specifications.

In this note we present a simple and relatively fast procedure based on a commercially available laser device that should guarantee, before the layer gluing, the correct positioning of each tube of a layer at the level of \(\sim\)10 \(\upmu\)m.

## 2 Laser system and monitoring procedure

The laser device we have used is produced by Sensor Instrument GmbH [1] (sender/receiver: A-LAS 24/90, vertical slit; Control Box: SI-CON1) and is used to monitor the correct alignment of mechanical pieces over a distance up to 10 m.

The laser sender produces a rectangular beam, 1x16 mm\({}^{2}\), \(\lambda\) = 670 nm, with a power output up to 1 mW. The amplifier can be tuned to give a voltage output up to 10 V. Both sender and receiver are housed in a box 28x24x96 mm\({}^{3}\) (see fig. 1). (Price about 3.3 KSF).

The principle of the quality control procedure is sketched in fig. 2. The sender and the receiver are mounted on adjustable supports at the two ends of the comb with the slit parallel to the y-axis1. The position and orientation of the sender are adjusted to give a laser beam parallel to the plane defined by the granite table. The height respect to the table is such that a reference rod, 30.000 mm diameter, placed on two adjacent plugs, will intercept \(\sim\)50% of the beam to ensure the best linearity response (see Ref.1). The stainless steel reference rod will be very precise (less than 2 \(\upmu\)m max deviation from circularity) and 10 mm long in order to sit in a comfortable way on the 4 mm wide precision surface of the end-plugs.

Footnote 1: Y-axis perpendicular to the marble table, z parallel to the combs, x in the tube direction.

For the alignment of the beam, precision stainless steel rods with the same diameter of the precision reference ring of the end plugs (30.020 mm) are placed at the two extreme ends of the combs, simulating end-plugs in position on the comb. The reference rod is placed on the first and last pair of rods and the sender angular orientation is tuned in such a way to give the same output voltage on the receiver in both positions, defining in this way the ideal alignment straight line.

Once a full layer of tube end-plugs is positioned on the comb, kept in place by the sucking system, the reference rod will be placed on all pairs of adjacent end-plugs (see fig. 2); any decrease in the output voltage of the receiver will indicate an increase in the laser beam shadowing and therefore a misplacement of one of the two end-plugs in y or z (see fig.3).

## 3 Laser system calibration and performance

The calibration and the accuracy of the system have been measured using a precision rod and \(\sim\) 10 \(\upmu\)m shims. The voltage output of the receiver was monitored with a Keithley 179A multimeter with 1 mV resolution (in the final set-up this could be replaced by an ADC-card read-out by a PC). The operating conditions of the device were: 2.0 V on the laser control voltage, 25 V on the supply voltage. With these settings the full beam was giving a receiver output of \(\sim\)9 V. The laser beam was aligned respect to the precision granite table with sender and receiver placed at \(\sim\)20 cm distance. The reference rod was positioned on the granite table between sender and receiver. The height of the sender-receiver was adjusted until the rod was shadowing \(\sim\)50% of the beam. At this point shims, \(\sim\)10 um thickness each, were placed under the rod and the output voltage was measured as a function of the shim thickness. The height of the rod respect to the granite table was also measured with a Mitutoyo Linear Height 600 device (\(\pm\)1 um accuracy) [2]. The result is shown in fig.4; the linearity is good, with a 0.94 mV/\(\upmu\)m slope. The accuracy (obtained repositioning the rod on the table 30 times) has a \(\upsigma\) of \(\sim\)2.3 um (see fig.5); the same measurement was repeated after one hour and the average value of the output was found to be stable at the mV (\(\sim\)1 um) level.

In order to evaluate the performance of the system we have done a test using one of the final combs (1100 mm long) that will be used in the Rome assembly jig. The set up is sketched in fig.6; the comb was positioned on the granite assembly table (the granite table planarity along a comb is at 3 um level) and the laser system was mounted at the two ends on adjustable supports. The alignment was performed with the procedure outlined above using a precision stainless steel rods (30.020 \(\pm\) 0.002 mm diameter) positioned in the first and last end-plug housings. The reference rod was re-positioned 30 times on the first and last housing. The results show, as expected, accuracy at the level of 2.5 um.

The reference rod was then positioned on the 36 housings of the comb and the rod height measured with the laser device as well as with the Mitutoyo. The plot of the difference \(\Delta\)y between the laser and Mitutoyo measurements as a function of the rod position is shown in fig.7. Fig.8 shows the distribution of \(\Delta\)y. As it can be seen the two measurements are in quite good agreement (a few um systematic of the laser system is visible) and the \(\upsigma\) is 3.5 um, to be compared with 2.5 um expected from the combination of the two devices resolution. The measurements were done in standard ambient light condition, and at a room temperature ranging from 20.5 \(\upsigma\)C to 21.5 \(\upsigma\)C.

## 4 Conclusion

We conclude that the proposed laser monitoring system is able to measure the correct positioning of each plug with accuracy \(\upsigma\) = 3.5 um in y, completely adequate to detect misplacement of the end-plugs that can affect the 20 um requested accuracy. This system is relatively cheap in comparison with more sophisticated systems, fast (the monitor a tube layer takes about half an hour) and easy to use.
