PROSPECTS FOR HIGGS SEARCH WITH TAUS IN THE MSSM

INTRODUCTION

In a supersymmetric theory, a Higgs structure more complex than in the Standard Model is required (by counung of degrees of freedom and also because the masses of up and down type quarks cannot be done with the same doublet). In the minimal supersymetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM),one has just to add a second Higgs doublet. After the Higgs mechanism to give masses to the W and Z, 5 (=8-3,) fields are physical. These fields are 2 scalars (h and H),one pseudoscalar (A) and 2 charged ( H+-). A general overview of the Higgs sector of the MSSM can be found in [1].

In the following,we will first recall briefly the more important features of the model,in the first section. In the second section,we will concentrate on the channels involving tau decay of the neutral Higgses: after an overview of the various strategies,we will discuss the case of both taus decaying to leptons and the case of one tau decaying to lepton,the other one to hadrons. This section will also include few comments on the missing transverse momentum measurement and on the lepton isolation which are important for these channels.

On the lepton-hadron channel two independant studies were performed in Orsay and in Milan, leading to similar conclusions; the Milan one,that uses the same tau identification strategy already employed for the H+ study, is described in the Appendix.

Finally in the third section we will present the consequences for the MSSM model and we will also try to summarize the sensitivity regions of the various channels investigating the Higgs sector of the MSSM.

1) THEORETICAL BACKGROUND ON THE HIGGS SECTOR OF THE MSSM

a) introduction

At the tree level,the Higgs sector of the MSSM depends on only 2 parameters which can be for exemple the A mass and turn( \(\beta\))=v2/v1 (v1 being the vacuum expectation value of the doublet which gives masses to the leptons and down quarks and v2 the v.e.v of the doublet which gives masses to up type quarks. ) The tau( \(\beta\) ) range permitted is = 1 to = m(top)/m(0). At the tree level,one obtains well known relations giving all the masses and also the mixing angle \(\alpha\) between the two neutral scalar bosons. From this one can deduce (at the tree level) the famous inequalities

M(W),M(A)<M(H+),M(H) m(h)<M(Z)<M(H) and M(h)<M(A)<M(H)

All the couplings can also be computed from M(A) and tau( \(\beta\) ).

However, all these results,deduced from tree level computations, are subjets to large radiative corrections ([2]) mainly from the heavy top quark and its supersymetric partner. These radiative corrections contain terms proportional to M(top)**2. An other free additional paramater is the squark mass (with a smaller dependence). It has been assumed that the common squark mass is = 1 TeV. Finally, one ends with 3 main parameters: M(A),tan( \(\beta\) ) and M(top). Figure 1 (taken from [1]) shows the values of M(h), M(H)and M H= in the M(A),tan ( 3 ) plane for for M(^->)=120 and 160 GeV. Clearly in a large parameter space the h mass becomes larger than M(Z), thus escaping probably at LEP2. One should also notice that at large tan 3, M(H) = M(A) for M(A) < 100 GeV and M(H) = M(A) (within 10 GeV) for M(A)>150 GeV.

Concerning the couplings,the h coupling to leptons and down quarks is modified by -sin ( - cos 3 ) - with respect to the SM Higgs, the coupling to up type quarks by cosi ( \(\alpha\)/sum ( 3 ) and the coupling to W and Z by sin ( 3 - \(\alpha\) ). For the H these factors are respectively cosi ( \(\alpha\)/cosi ( 3 ) ) sin ( \(\alpha\)/sum 3 ) and cosi 3 - \(\alpha\) ). Finally for the A one coupling to leptons and down type quarks is proportional to tan ( 3 ) while the coupling to up type quarks is proportional to cotan ( 3 ). The A does not couple to W and Z. The values of these factors are shown in Figure 2 in the M(A),tan ( 3 ) plane

b: channels of interest for the search at LHC

In the following we assume that the MSSM Higgs boson do not decay to supersymetric particles.

For the h.since its mass is smaller than = 130 GeV (except if the top is very heavy = 200 GeV) it can not be seen in 4 leptons and the dominant decay mode is b bbar. The only possible channel is therefore Y Y

In the compuuaton of the Y Branching ratio.one has to take into account not only the modificaon of the coupling but also the presence of supersymetric loops which have the opposite sign of the dominant W loop and therefore reduce by = 30 % the branching ratio. The h is produced by gluon fusion (via top loop) and the cross-section is sensitive to the coupling to the top. The rate is reasonable only if the h couplings are close the S.M Higgs couplings ( for large M(A) values). (see Figure 3)

Concerning the H, the decay to WW and ZZ is supressed by the factor cosi ( \(\beta\) - \(\alpha\) )**2 which is small except for low M(A) values. The b bbar width is also enhanced by the factor tan( \(\beta\) )**2 and therefore the region accessible via the 4 leptons mode is small (see figure 4) In the large tan( \(\beta\) ) region where the dominant decay mode is b bbar, the tau branching ratio is quite large ( M (\(\tau\))**2/(3*M(b)**2) where M(b) is the running mass evaluated at the higgs mass is = 10 %) and the production cross-section can also be large (see Figure 5)

For the H+. the main chance to see it is in the top decay (if M(H+) < M(top) ) followed by H+ -> t v. In the region accessible kinematically, almost all the tan( \(\beta\) ) range can be covered (see [3]).

Finally, for the A,the dominant decay modes are potentially bbar and tbar ( if kinematically allowed) but the second channel is supressed by cotan( \(\beta\) )**4 and therefore at large tan( \(\beta\) ), bbar dominates. Since the coupling to taus is also proportional to tan( \(\beta\) ) the tau BR is quite large : = 10 %. The A cross section production via gluon gluon is also proportional to tan( \(\beta\) )**2 at large tan( \(\beta\) ) where the b loop dominates ( at moderate value of tan( \(\beta\) ) the cross section decreases with tan( \(\beta\) ) because the top loop dominates). The associated bbar A production is also fully proportionnal to tan( \(\beta\) )**2. Therefore at large tan( \(\beta\) ), large rates are expected for A -> t t. (see Figure 6)

2) SEARCH FOR A AND H DECAYS TO TAU PAIRS.

a) Search strategies

First, let us recall that for M(A)>150 GeV, the H mass is equal to the A mass within less than 10 GeV. and also that both the cross-sections for A -> t t and H -> t t can be large. Therefore in this region, the cross-sections of both processes should be added to obtain the signal rate. The same situation happens with the h for M(A)<100 GeV. Figure 7 gives the total signal rate for the t : final state including the various cross-section mecanisms.

PAGE 3

In order to avoid the huge QCD 2 jet background, at least one tau should be required to decay to a lepton electron or muon). Therefore, one can disungush between 2 man channels :

: -> ev v and : -> u v v

: ->| v v and : -> v + hadrons

The first channel has a branching ratio of 6.4% while the second channel has the much larger branching ratio of 46%, but of course the background is also much larger.

An important feature of the kinematic of the final state is that first the tau decay products are going almost in the same direction than the taus and also that, thanks the large transverse momentum of the Higgs produced by gluon fusion, the 2 taus are not going perfectly back to back. Therefore, if the missing transverse momentum is measured, the momentum of each tau can be fully reconstructed ([4]). Let call E1 (resp E2) the total energy of the neutrinos from the first (resp the second) tau and u1 and u2 the two unit vector of the tau direction. One has the system

(E1*u1)x + (E2*u2)x = Px missing

(E1*u1)y + (E2*u2)y = Py missing

The determinant of this system is simply sin( \(\Delta\) ( \(\phi\) )) where \(\Delta\)\(\phi\) is the azimutal separation between the 2 taus which is not egal to \(\pi\). Therefore this system can be solved. and E1 and E2 measured. This allows a full measurement of the 4-momentum of both taus and therefore the mass reconstruction. Obviously, if one neglect the resolution on the leptons, the mass resolution is proportional to \(\sigma\) (Pumiss) / sin( \(\Delta\) ( \(\phi\) )). Both the Pumiss measurement and the Pt of the Higgs are therefore important.

In the section b) we will show the expected Pt (Higgs) distribution and compare the Monte Carlo (PYTHIA) with theoretical computations. The section c) will describe the Pt(missing) measurement and the resolution expected. In d) we will comment on the lepton isolation which is important to reduce b bbar background (this is well known to be the dominant production of single or double lepton in the Pt range 10 -> 50 GeV). Finally section e) will describe the 2 lepton channel and section f) the lepton-hadron channel with emphasis on the identification of the hadronic decay of the tau.These two sections will give the sensitivity cross-sections expected for various Higgs masses.

In all this part, we assume an integrated luminosity of 10**4 pb-1, corresponding to one year running at a luminosity of 10**33 cm-2s-1.

Previous results on this channel can be found in [4],[5],[6].

b) Transverse momentum of the Higgs

We use PYTHIA5.4 to generate gluon gluon -> H(SM) -> t t events with the initial state radiation switched on. The PYTHIA prediction of the Higgs transverse momentum can be compared to theoretical computation using leading log resummation of soft gluons at low Pt and \(\alpha\) s perturbative computation at large Pt [7]. The comparison is shown in Figure 8 for sqrt(s) =40 TeV. A reasonable agreement can be seen, in particular the predicted averages transverse momentum are egal.

In fact the signal that we are looking for is not only Higgs produced by gluon-gluon fusion. An important part of the cross-section originates from the associated b bbar Higgs production via gluon fusion. This production can also be simulated in PYTHIA. The Pt of the produced Higgs is shown in Figure 9 for this process and compared to the standard gluon fusion process. The difference is small ( it has been checked that the acceptances and mass resolutions are very close for a 200 GeV Higgs) and therefore in the following we will use only the gluon-gluon fusion process to generate the events.

PACE 1

c1 Missing transverse momentum measurement

The resolution on the transverse momentum of the neutrino depends on many effects : The rapidity coverage,the calorimeter resolution (including the intrinsic resolution and also the effect of the electronic noise in the case of LAr calorimeter) and the cracks effect. In the following we will investigate the first 2 points with emphasis on the effect of the electronic noise. The cracks effect is mainly expected to unrotuce non-gaussian tails and has effect on the resolution in the events with true neutrinos is probably small.

To investigate the effect of the rapidity coverage, H \(\sim\) + t events generated with PYTHIA have been used to compute the resolution on each component of PYTHIA (missing). The result is shown in Figure 10 as a function of the rapidity coverage of the calorimeter.This Figure shows the resolution with perfect calorimeter resolution and also including a resolution of 10%/sqrt(E) for photons and 80%/sqrt(E) for hadrons. As can be seen on this figure, the effect of the rapidity coverage is dominant up to coverage around 4 to 5 in pseudorapidity. With a coverage of \(\sim\)-5, the effect of particles escaping the acceptance contributes to \(\sim\) 3.5 GeV to the resolution. Including the sampling term of the calorimeter increases this value to \(\sim\) 4.5 GeV. This last value can be consider as the best which can be achieved with a resonable detector.

Concerning the electronic noise, we use the value corresponding to a LAr accordion calorimeter giving a noise of \(\sim\) 215 MeV transverse energy per 0.06*0.06 \(\Delta\)(\(\eta\))\({}^{a}\) (\(\phi\) ) in the barrel ( \(\approx\) -1.6 in \(\eta\)) thus noise being dominated by the noise in the EM part of the calor, and \(\sim\) 320*R/Rbarrel MeV in energy for the End-Cap (the ratio R/Rbarrel accounts for the fact that a constant \(\eta\)\(\phi\) granularity gives cell sizes decreasing in the ratio R(=radial distance to the beam) R(barrel) ). Note that this noise corresponds to a calorimeter optimized for high luminosity operation. An eventual noise in the very forward calorimeters has most probably a negligible effect and is therefore neglected. The resulting resolution on the total transverse momentum is = 12 GeV as computed easily by Monte Carlo and in fact this value is fully dominated by the barrel part which contributes to \(\sim\) 11 GeV. This value can easily be obtained by simple analytical computation. In order to reduce the effect of the electronic noise which at this level is large, it is possible to use only in the missing transverse momentum computation the calorimeter cells in which the transverse energy is larger than some cut. If the cut is correctly choosen, only the cells in which real energy is deposited will be used and the majority of cells which have only electronic noise will be removed from the computation. The prize is obviously to introduce a small bias in the Pt(missing) computation because low energy particles are ignored. The value of the cut has been optimized using H \(\sim\) + t events from PYTHIA ( clearly to do this, one should use events with real neutrinos ) and Figure 11 shows the resolution on each component of the neutrino transverse momentum as a function of the cut. From this Figure an optimal value of the cut around 0.8 GeV can be deduced and this value will be used in all the following. The resulting value for the missing transverse momentum resolution is = 6 GeV, at low luminosity ( 10**33 cm-2s-1).

d) lepton isolation and b bbar background rejection

To investigate the rejection from lepton isolation, a large number of b bbar events have been generated with PYTHIA with Pt \(>\) 10 GeV and Pt \(>\) 25 GeV. From this 2 samples, events containing an electron or a muon with Pt \(>\) 10 ( or 25 GeV) have been selected leading to 2 samples of = 4000 and 2000 events.

The efficiency of a cut of \(\Sigma\) (Et) in a window (2DR*2DR) centered around the lepton is shown in Figure 12 for various sizes DR of the window, for Pt \(>\) 10 GeV and Pt \(>\) 25 GeV, after a crude simulation including the effect of the magnetic field and of the electronic noise ( but without pile-up : We are in this part at 10**33 cm-2s-1). Figure 13 shows the resulting rejection after a cut at 1.5 GeV on this variable and the efficiency on isolated lepton as a function of the Pt of the lepton, using a window of 0.9*0.9 centered on the lepton candidate ( note that the same cut of 0.8 GeV as in the previous section is used to define cellscunturbing to the sum). This '-jection is = 6 at Pt=10 GeV and increases rapidly with the Pt of the lepton ( = 100 at Pt=25 GeV).

An other possibility to apply isolation at low luminosity is to require no additional charged tracks above 1 GeV around the lepton candidate. The result of this method is shown in Figure 13, using a cone of 0.5 on the 0 m space. The rejection obtained is a little bit better a low Pt ( around 8).

These rejection values will be used in the next section in the estimation of the b bbar background.

e) e - u channel

This channel has the (low) Branching ratio of 6.3%. The main backgrounds are : tbar production followed by t -> b e v and the -> bbar u v, bbar production with the same decay and also the tau pair production via Drell-Yan or Z exchange followed by decay to e - u. The tbar and Z/Drell-Yan Backgrounds have been computed using Pythia while for the bbar background the ratio bbar/tbar given in Ref[8] is used together with the rejection value from isolation quoted in the previous section.(this assumes that the kinematical cuts applied after the Pt(lepton) cut have the same acceptances for b bbar and t that is probably pessimistic).

Concerning the simulation of the signal using PYTHIA, we use the standard Higgs production ( via gluon fusion ) to determine the acceptances of the kinematical cuts. In PYTHIA, for the decay of the taus, each tau is assumed to be unpolarized. Of course, in average, in Higgs decay the taus are not polarized but event by event, there is a correlation between the polarization of the t + and the t -. This effect is not included in PYTHIA. In order to estimate the size of this effect on the efficiency of the kinematical cuts on the leptons, the tau decay to lepton in PYTHIA has been replaced by the correct decay to electron or muon. taking into account this effect of correlation. The comparison between the results obtained with this modified PYTHIA with the standard PYTHIA is illustrated in Figure 14 where the efficiency of the cuts Pt(E)=Pt(min) and Pt( u )>Pt(min) is shown as a function of Pt(min) ( for a Higgs mass of 200 GeV) As seen in this figure the difference is very small and therefore the standard PYTHIA has been used to compute all the acceptances. ( As stressed in Ref[3] this effect of the polarization is much larger for the H+ decay to t v because in this case all the taus are right-handed while in the neutral Higgs case the only effect is a effect of correlation between the taus )

The following kinematical cuts are applied to select the events :

Pt(e) and Pt( u ) > 15 GeV with | | < 2.5

| sin( ( e - u )) | > 0.4

The cut on the Pt of the leptons has been choosen to obtain a b bbar background smaller than the t tbar background after isolation,( b-bbar/t-bar = 0.4 using Risolation = 10**2 ) while preserving an acceptable efficiency for the signal.

In the next stage, the mass is reconstructed according to the method described in section 2)a). The cut on sin( ) keeps the events which are expected to have a "good" mass resolution. At this level, the reconstructed neutrinos are required to have positive momentums around the lepton directions. The reconstructed mass are shown in Figure 15 for the different Higgs masses and for the tbar and Z/Drell-Yan backgrounds. The acceptances, including a mass cut around the Higgs mass, are shown in Table 1. From these values, the signal sensitivity (= cross-section*BR (A or H -> t t ) for 5 sigmas effect) are derived assuming a lepton efficiency of 90% and an integrated luminosity of 1000 pb-1.

f) lepton-hadron channel PACE 6

This channel has the advantage of the high Branching Ratio of 46% but require good capabilities to identify hadronic decays of the tau in order to reduce the large backgrounds involving jet misidentification.

For the tau identification, the starting point is jets reconstructed in the calorimeter ( with Pt > 40 GeV). This jet is first required to be isolated by considering the difference between the energy deposited in a 0.4 cone and the energy deposited in a 0.2 cone to be small (typically less than 5 GeV). After this a track with a Pt larger than 10 GeV is required to be in a 0.2 cone around the jet axis and events with an other track above 2 GeV Pt in a cone of 0.4 DR radius are rejected (with this the 3-prong decays of the tau are rejected but the rejection is very significantly improved as can be shown in Figure 16). At this level, the rejection against jets is = 100 with an efficiency for tau ( with Pb=40 GeV) around 60% (see Table 2). The following cuts to define a tau will be referred in the following as the "standard" cuts.

The following kinematical cuts are applied :

Pt(lepton) > 25 GeV

Pt(tau) > 40 GeV

 within = 2.5 in \(\eta\)

 isin (\(\Delta\) (\(\phi\))) > 0.4

 no other jets with Pb=40 GeV in the event

correct reconstruction of the neutrino unpulsions

The various backgrounds envisaged are : W-jet(s), t-bar,Z/Drell-Yan, b-bar.All these backgrounds except b-bbar are computed using PYTHIA. For the b-bbar background the same method as in the previous section is used. This gives an estimate of the b-bbar at the same level than t-bar (after isolation). The results are given in Table 3. The sensitivity is almost the same than in the e \(\mu\) channel (except at large masses where the lepton-hadron channel is = 2 times better) Concerning the signal acceptances, the low values obtained are mainly a consequence of the cuts on the Pt used. In particular the 25 GeV cut on Pt(lepton) seems necessary to have a reasonable first level trigger rate at 10\({}^{\circ}\)*33 cm-2 s-1 ( for the electron case.see [9]) and also to avoid larger background from b-bbar. Concerning the background, the dominant contribution is W-jet but t-bbar is only a factor = 2 smaller. This t-bar background is composed from true tau as t = 60% and fake taus at = 40%. From this, one can deduce that = 15% of the background is irreducible ( true taus), = 30% is from b-jets faking taus and = 55% from other jets faking taus. Obviously, the fraction from b-jets has large uncertainties.

At this level,the background is therefore dominated by the reducible backgrounds and an eventuel improvement in the tau identification can improve the sensitivity of this channel. Two methods can be envisaged: tau-tagging by microvertex or finer analysis in the calorimeter exploiting the granularity to compute the mass of the tau candidate.

For the microvertex, we assume a resolution on the impact parameter of 30 microns ([10]). Figure 17 shows the expected impact parameter distribution of the track associated to the tau candidate assuming 100% efficiency and perfect gaussian resolution for the background. Obviously, a cut on the impact parameter can significantly enhance the tau signal with respect to the non-b jet background. On the other hand, since the b-lifetime is a factor = 3 larger than the tau lifetime and the impact parameter is at first order independant of \(\gamma\), the efficiency for b-jets is in fact larger than the efficiency for tau-jets. This is summarized in Table 2. From this table, one can see that a cut on the impact parameter will in fact reduce the significance of the signal if there is more than = 10% of taus or b-jets in the background before the cut. Since this is probably the case, we don't use a cut on the impact parameter. But,of course, the capabilities to tag taus will be welcome if the non-b jet background happens to be larger, or as cross-check of the "standard" tau selection. The same remarks are also valid for the e \(\mu\) channel where the tagging can reduce significantly the background from t-bar but will probably not increase the significance of the signal because of the non negligible contribution of the b-bbar background. The difference on this point with the Appendix comes probably from a small difference in the tau and b composition of the background since the effect of the impact parameter on the significance is very dependent from this number.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

PACE 3

This channel is discussed in (3). If the H+ mass is smaller than the top mass ( t -> bH+ is allowed) all the tan( 3 ) range between = 1 and 50 can be covered.The resulting coverage in the (M(A),tan( 3 )) plane is shown in Figure 25 ( for M(top)=140 GeV).

### Summary

Figure 26 gives a summary of the expected sensitivity of EAGLE for the Higgs sector of the MSSM ( for Mtop=140 GeV) Both the 5 sigmas and the 2 sigmas contours are shown (2 sigmas correpondes to 95%cl exclusion if no signal is seen). For the t t channel, thanks the tan( 3 )**2 increase of the cross-section,the sensitivity cannot deteriorate very significantly ( event if background is 4 times larger than expected, the minimal value of tan( 3 ) changes by 'only' 40%). Obviously this is not the case for the Y Y channel where a factor 2 reducton in sensitivity reduce to nothing the sensitivity region.

If the top mass is significantly larger ( = 200 GeV), the LEP2 sensitivity region is reduced. The h-> Y can be seen in a larger parameter space (the h mass is larger with a maximum value of = 150 GeV). For the same reason, h-> 41 can be seen at large values of M(A) (typically above = 200 GeV ) where the h couplings are quasi-standards. The H-> 41 sensitivity region is also somewhat increased. Finally,the H+ can be seen in a larger region because t->bH+ becomes possible for larger H+ masses and M(H+) = sqrt(M(A)*2+M(W)**2).

The results presented in Figure 26 agree with the estimation of the various sensitivity regions presented in [1]. Other estimations of the exploration of the Higgs sector of the MSSM can be found in [15], where qualitatively the results are comparable but seem to be more optimistic quantitatively. (in particular the estimation of the LEP2 limits are very significantly more optimistic and the hole at M(A) = 150 GeV and tan( 3 ) = 7 has almost vanished. This difference comes from the fact that [11] assumes the'standard" value sqrt(s)=190 GeV for LEP2 while [15] uses 200 GeV, therefore the kinematical limit for the hZ channel moves by = 10 GeV and this gives significant difference for the sensitivity region in the (M(A),tan( 3 )) plane as can be seen in Figure 1)

Other possible channels are suggested in [15], for instance A -> 2h -> |+h -> bbar at low tan( 3 ) for M(A) < 2*M(top). (for M(A)=200 GeV,tan( 3 )=2 and M(top)=150 GeV, the cross-section for this process is = 0.6 pb. The dominant background is Z*2jets which can potentially be reduced using b tagging?).

As a last comment,it should be noticed that all the previous analysis assume that supersymmetric particles are heavy enough not to affect the production and decay of the Higgs particles ( typically their masses should be larger than = 200 GeV)

## Conclusions

Despite the fact that the Higgs sector of the MSSM is probably a center-example of the no-lose theorem, a significant part of the space parameter is accessible at LHC and improves significantly the expected LEP2 coverage. The two main channels needed to cover large region of the (M(A),tan( 3 )) plane at LHC are h -> Y Y and A (or H) -> t : if the top mass is close to the expected value of = 140 GeV. Concerning the first channel, it should be stressed that the MSSM case is always more difficult than the Minimal Standard Model and that the maximum possible sensitivity is welcome ( as can be seen in Figure 3) For the second channel, part of the job can be 'done using the e H final state. However, the possibility to detect hadronic decays of the tau is clearly very useful. With the ingredients discussed in this note (measurement of P(miss),rejection of lepton from b using isolation,identification of hadronic tau decays,...), the sensitivity expected from this channel is quite important.

## Appendix A \(.4^{0}\) and \(H^{0}\to\tau\tau\): Lepton-Hadron Channel

### Physics processes and background

The process:

\[pp\to A^{0}(H^{0})+X\]

\[A^{0}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\ \tau^{-}\to e^{-}(\mathrm{or}\mu^{-})\overline{\nu_{e}} \nu_{\tau},\ \tau^{+}\to\mathrm{hadrons}\ +\ \overline{\nu_{\tau}} \tag{1}\]

has been studied in the EAGLE framework. The luminosity considered is \(10^{33}\)\(cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

the statistics used corresponds to one year time (\(10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\)); where existing, the charge conjugate processes are always implied. For the \(H^{0}\) role see the beginning of section A.4.

The tagging of the process requires the presence of one isolated \(e\) or \(\mu\) with \(p_{T}>p_{T}^{lept}\) (\(p_{T}^{lept}=24,40\) GeV) and \(|\eta_{e,\mu}|\leq 2\), and the lepton identification efficiency \(\epsilon_{e,\mu}\) is assumed to be = 90%; an efficiency of = 90% for lepton isolation is also assumed.

The sources of background here considered are the Standard Model processes:

\[pp\to t\overline{t}\]

\[t\to\mathrm{W^{+}b},\ \mathrm{a}\ \mathrm{)}\ \mathrm{W^{+}}\to\tau^{+}\nu_{\tau},\ \tau^{+}\to\mathrm{hadrons}\ +\ \overline{\nu_{\tau}}\ \mathrm{b}\mathrm{)W^{+}}\to \mathrm{hadrons} \tag{2a}\] \[\overline{t}\to\mathrm{W^{-}b},\ \mathrm{W^{-}}\to e^{-}\ \mathrm{or}\ \mu^{-}\] (2b) \[pp\to W^{-}+\mathrm{jets},\ \mathrm{W^{-}}\to e^{-}\ \mathrm{or}\ \mu^{-}\] (3) \[pp\to b\overline{b}\] \[\mathrm{b}\to\mathrm{jets},\ \overline{b}\to e^{-}\ \mathrm{or}\ \mu^{-}\] (4) \[pp\to Z^{0}+X\] \[\mathrm{Z^{0}}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-},\ \tau^{-}\to e^{-}(\mathrm{or}\mu^{-}) \overline{\nu_{e}}\nu_{\tau},\ \tau^{+}\to\mathrm{hadrons}\ +\ \overline{\nu_{\tau}} \tag{5}\]

In processes (2b) (3) and (4) the hadronic jets in the event are misidentified as \(\tau\)'s hadronic decays (fake \(\tau\)'s).

### Events generation

Events from processes (1) have been generated using PYTHIA MC (version 3.5) for \(m_{A^{0}}=200,300,400\) GeV (\(\sim 3\) Kevts per mass) using the 2 \(\to\) 1 non SM process gg or \(\mathrm{q\overline{q}}\) into \(A^{0}\). The values allowed for \(\hat{p}_{T}\) range between 0 and 200 GeV, no multiple interactions are generated and \(|y|<6.5\) for the product with largest (smallest) rapidity in the process. The Higgs couplings assumed in PYTHIA are the SM ones: howeverfor cross-sections evaluation a full theoretical computation has been used as describe below in this note.

Process (5) (\(\sim\) 3 Kevts) has been generated with the SM 2 - 1 option, with the same structure; for processes (3) and (4), we used the same generations as in [1]. For process (2) (\(\sim\) 4 Kevts) \(m_{t}\) = 140 GeV has been choosen.

The simplified EAGLE simulation described in [1] has been used, with a calorimeter granularity of 0.03\({}^{\mbox{\scriptsize{\raisebox{0.86pt}{$\bullet$}}}}\)0.02.

### Events selection

The event is selected if there is at least 1 jet with \(E_{T}^{jet}>E_{T}^{\Lambda}\) (\(E_{T}^{\Lambda}\) = 30.60.40 GeV) \(\eta_{\uparrow}\leq 2\), outside a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.4\) around the trigger lepton direction. For \(\tau\)'s identification the set (a) of criteria, as described in [1], has been used.

The jet selected must be isolated from the trigger lepton further requiring the cut:

\(\Delta\Phi(jet-e)>130^{\circ}\)

because in the \(A^{0}\) decay case the \(\tau\) and the lepton are much more back to back than in the backgrounds as shown in figure 1.

A cut is also applied on the mass of the \(A^{0}\) system reconstructed as explained in section 2.a of this note, according to the relation:

\(M_{A^{0}}-\Delta M\leq M_{A^{0}}\leq M_{A^{0}}\) + \(\Delta M\)

where \(\Delta M\) is equal to 50 GeV if \(M_{A^{0}}\) = 200 GeV and equal to 100 GeV in the other two cases. Figure 2 shows the mass distribution for \(A^{0}\) events and for backgrounds. The \(A^{0}\) mass is calculated only if \(E_{\tau_{1}}\),\(E_{\tau_{2}}>0\). In \(\sim\)30% of the \(A^{0}\) events we find \(E_{\nu_{1}}\) or \(E_{\tau_{2}}<0\): this is due in \(\sim\)10% of the cases to the assumption that the two neutrinos have the same direction of the jet and of the lepton respectively; in the other cases this is due to 7% (gaussian) smearing applied to both \(\mu_{\tau}\) and \(\mu_{\tau}\), taking into account resolution and electronic noise as explained in section 2.c of this note.

To distinguish between events with a'spherical' shape and events with a 'back-to-back' shape, the variable circularity has been defined as: \(C=2\lambda_{1}/(\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2})\) with \(\lambda_{1}>\lambda_{2}\), where \(\lambda_{1.2}\) are the eigenvalues of the 2x2 matrix \(T\) (with \(T(1,1)=p_{2}^{2}\), \(T(2.2)=p_{\tau}^{2}\), \(T(2,1)=T(1,2)=p_{\tau}\cdot p_{\tau}\)). This definition corresponds to the 2-dimension analogous of sphericity [2]. \(C\) plots for \(A^{0}\) events and backgrounds are shown in fig. 3. A cut \(C<0.2\) has been tried, but it is not very useful after applying the cut described in the following, and it has not been used in order to save statistics.

A last variable that seems to be very useful is IMP, the impact parameter of the particle defined as the distance of closest approach between a track and the production vertex, projected in the transverse plane. A parametrization of the uncertainty \(\sigma\) on [IMP, reconstructed using the SITV detector has been provided by S. Gadomsky as a function of momentum \(p\) and pseudorapidity \(\eta\): \(\sigma_{IMP}=\sqrt{A^{2}+(B(\eta)/p)^{2}}\) where \(A\) = 0.026 mm. \(B(\eta)=0.22exp[ln10(0.22\eta^{2}+0.04|\eta|)]\) (mm). The IMP distribution is assumed to be a gaussian centered at zero for the tracks coming directly from the main vertex, while in the case of \(\tau\)'s and \(b\)'s, it is centered at IMP\({}_{0}\), given by: IMP\({}_{0}\) = \(\beta\gamma\)ctsin\(\theta\)sin\(\nu\) where \(\beta,\gamma\) are the usual relativistic variables, \(t\) is the lifetime of the particle, \(\psi\) is the angle between the track of maximum \(p_{T}\) of the decay products and the father, \(\theta\) is the polar angle.

A jet is retained as a \(\tau\) candidate only if its highest \(p_{T}\) track has an impact parameter: \(IMP>2\sigma_{IMP}\).

Figure 4 shows the IMP distributions for \(A^{0}\) events and for the backgrounds. This cut improves the final significance of the signal by a factor \(18-27\%\). depending on the \(.4^{0}\) mass.

### Results

For the prediction of Higgs sector cross sections, branching ratios etc., the values given by \(\langle 3\rangle\) are used: note that for the region considered in this study (\(tg3>5.m_{A^{0}}>200\) GeV) the \(H^{0}\) scalar boson is expected to have the same mass as the \(.4^{0}\) and enhances the expected number of \(\tau\tau\) events by a factor \(\sim 2\), which is taken into account in the following.

Table 1 shows the number of \(.4^{0}\) events expected in \(10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\), using \(E_{T}^{\Lambda}=60GeV\) (that is the \(E_{T}^{\Lambda}\) value giving the best relative values for signal and background). \(p_{T}^{lept}=24\) GeV and the cuts described in the previous section for different values of \(tg3\) and the related acceptance.

Note that the acceptances of the signal take into account the lepton identification and isolation efficiencies (.90".90), the branching ratios of one \(\tau\) in lepton and the other in hadrons (.46), the efficiency of the request \(p_{T}\)(lepton) \(>24\) GeV (\(\sim.38-\sim.75\) according to the \(A^{0}\) mass generated), a factor (\(\sim.10-\sim.21\)) due to the kinematical cuts (\(E_{T}^{\Lambda}\), \(\Delta\Phi\), \(m(A^{0})\)), the set (a) of criteria of \(\tau\)-identification (\(\sim.47-\sim.57\)) and the reduction due to the IMP cut (\(\sim.55\)).

Table 2 shows the number of events expected from the backgrounds processes 2-5, (applying the same cuts as for the signal) in the three different mass windows. For the \(\delta\bar{b}\) background a lepton isolation factor = 100 is assumed (see section 2.d).

Most backgrounds are rejected with high efficiency also by kinematical cuts which makes difficult the reliable evaluation of the rejection power of \(\tau\)-identification using less than \(10^{5}\) events. In this case the rejection power of \(\tau\)-identification has been evaluated using events before the kinematical cuts. These values have been found to be consistent with the values quoted in ref.[1]. The overall rejection has finally been computed as the product of the kinematical and \(\tau\)-identification rejection. This approximation has been checked on the \(A^{0}\) events and has been found to reproduce the correct results within 10%.

Figure 5 and 6 show the signal significance, computed as \(S/\sqrt{(}B)\), for the three different masses as a function of \(tg\beta\), with \(p_{T}^{lept}=24\) or 40 GeV; the best significance is achieved for \(p_{T}^{lept}=40\) GeV, however the two values for \(p_{T}^{lept}\) give similar results and actually the significance are almost flat as a function of \(p_{T}^{lept}\), while the number of signal events expected with L = \(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) is reduced by a factor \(42-21\%\) (depending on the mass value).

### Conclusions

The main differences between this study and the one described in section 2.f are the use of the impact parameter and the \(\tau\) identification treatment. Comparing Fig. 24b and Fig. 6 the results on the significance are compatible. this study being only slightly more optimistic towards low \(A^{0}\) masses: the conclusions showed by Fig. 26 are thus confirmed by this Appendix.
