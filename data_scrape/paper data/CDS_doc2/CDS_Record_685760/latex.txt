**Results of the testbeams of RD16 (FERMI) with electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter prototypes**

The FERMI Collaboration

###### Abstract

Early prototypes of the readout electronics developed by RD16 (FERMI) took data during the summer of 1994 with a prototype of the ATLAS Hadronic Tile calorimeter, developed within RD 34, and with two prototypes of the ATLAS Electromagnetic Accordion end-cap calorimeter (the Spanish Fan and the Fresnel Lens). We present in this note a summary of the results with more detailed information available in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. Despite severe hardware limitations due to foundry process problems, the analysis of the acquired data show that the performance of this FERMI prototype version is perfectly adequate for the requirements of a Tile calorimeter.

For an Accordion calorimeter, with its faster shaping time, the prototype performance still requires some improvements. The main problem was connected to the limited bandwidth of the prototype compressor stage.

An event-by-event comparison of FERMI and Tile calorimeter data shows a relative spread of 0.6% at high energies. A similar comparison for Accordion data gives a spread of 1.2%.

The pedestal stability of the FERMI readout was found to be excellent with no drift detected. Also, the noise contribution was found to be 1.6 ADC count.

Experimental setup

### Hardware under test in May/July

The tests during May and July were limited to two channels. The reason was problems at the foundry leading to processing errors of the Analog ASIC which contains the compressor and the ADC.

The ADCs on the Analog ASIC wereunusable, but the compressors were working albeit with limited bandwidth. We therefore used two earlier ADC prototypes, with the compressors on the Analog ASIC, two working channels were obtained.

These channels were mounted on a card specifically designed for FERMI tests, triggered by a sequencer and read into a Fast Dual Port Memory. The channels were built using one VME module housing the compressor function and two ADC evaluation modules. A sequencer was used to control the acquisition and the Fast Dual Port Memory acted as storage interface. The whole system was contained in a VME crate. A description of this set up in in the version for laboratory tests can be found in [7].

### The data acquisition system

The data acquisition system (DAQ) was based on SPIDER, with the data being stored on Exabyte tapes. The system was able to acquire about 1000 triggers per SPS burst, and provided monitoring and online event display facilities.

A pulse window of 60 consecutive samples, corresponding to 1500 ns, was stored per trigger in each channel. The timing of the system was controlled by delay lines in order to have the detector signal to arrive in the interval between the 12th and the 18th sample. For the data taken with RD34 the peak of the signal was between the 18th and the 19th sample. For the data taken with the Accordion prototypes the peak of the signal was between the 15th and the 16th sample.

The relative phase between the triggers and the 40 MHz sampling clock of FERMI was measured with a LECROY 2228A TDC.

This completely stand-alone system provided great flexibility and the possibility, by splitting the analog signal, to carry out FERMI tests in parallel with the standard detector data-taking. For a subset of the data, it was possible to perform offline, an event by event comparison of the data acquired with FERMI and the data taken with the standard detector acquisition system.

### Data taking

For both calorimeters, prototype splitter configurations were designed that routed the output of the shapers to both the standard ADC and FERMI. The realization of this principle for the Tile calorimeter is discussed in [8].

#### 1.3.1 Data taken with the hadronic Tile calorimeter

In order to optimize the containment of electrons with the limited number of channels available, data taken in July had the Tile calorimeter turned 90\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to the beam and with the first two longitudinal sections instrumented. More than 99 % of the lateral and around 96 % of the longitudinal energy deposition for a 150 GeV electron should be contained in these two cells.

In this configuration \(\approx 85\)K events with 180 GeV pions and \(\approx 40\)K events with 100 GeV electrons were written on tape. For most of these events the synchronization with the RD34 DAQ was active, allowing offline comparison with the RD34 data.

In the same geometrical configuration, but with the two sides of a single cell connected to the two FERMI channels, a sample of \(\approx 50000\) muons was collected. For these data the synchronization was not active.

#### 1.3.2 Data taken with the electromagnetic Accordion calorimeter

With the Accordion calorimeter, the configuration having the largest shower containment was two adjacent cells. Even in this case, the fraction of an electron energy contained is limited and no clear peak is visible in the energy distribution.

With the Spanish Fan prototype, the following data were taken with electron beams with the splitters in synchronization with the Accordion acquisition: \(\approx 2300\) events at 20 GeV, \(\approx 1300\) events at 50 GeV, \(\approx 1200\) events at 100 GeV and \(\approx 1700\) events at 200 GeV.

With the Fresnel lens prototype in a stand alone mode, the following data were taken with electrons without the splitters: \(\approx 1000\) events at 20 GeV, \(\approx 1100\) events at 50 GeV, \(\approx 1800\) events at 100 GeV and \(\approx 1000\) events at 200 GeV.

Furthermore, with the Spanish Fan prototype and in a stand alone mode 41 runs of pulser data with \(\approx 5000\) events each were taken, with logarithmically spaced amplitude, scanning the whole dynamic range.

## 2 Pedestals and Noise

The stability of the pedestals and the noise of the Accordion calorimeter data was analyzed in the following way: empty events were selected, on which the pedestalvalue was measured by taking the average value of the ADC output. These events were selected using a cut on the r.m.s. of the distribution of all the samples in one event (the r.m.s. was required to be smaller than 2.5 ADC counts), because for real events the expected r.m.s. value must be significantly higher. This is shown in Fig.1.

The time dependency of the pedestals was analysed. The result is shown in Fig.2 where a straight line has been fitted on the pedestal versus time histogram showing that no drift of the pedestal values could be detected.

The noise of each channel was be measured by averaging the r.m.s. distribution of pedestal events with a typical distribution shown in Fig.3.

This analysis was done on all the data in Table 1. The average noise level is found to be 1.6 ADC counts. It should be noted that runs 162 to 166 were taken with the Fresnel Lens prototype and runs 170 to 174 with the Spanish Fan prototype. Since these two prototypes are equipped with different electronics (preamplifiers and

shapers) this may explain why the pedestal values are found to be slightly higher for the data taken on the Spanish Fan. However, the observed shift is only of the order of half an ADC count.

## 3 Software tools for the analysis

### Look-up tables

In FERMI the shaped signal is fed to an analog compressor that performs a compression of the dynamic range from 16 bits to 10 bits. The samples from the ADC are restored to the full range by a look-up table containing the inverse of the compressor transfer function. For every compressor-ADC combination, the look-up table is constructed using measurements performed in the laboratory where step pulses of known amplitude are fed into the compressor and the amplitude of the outputs are recorded. This procedure gives a relation between input and output of the compress

\end{table}
Table 1: Measured pedestal and noise expressed in ADC countssor that can be inverted to obtain a look-up table. An example of a look-up table calculated in this way is shown in Fig.4.

A potential source of problems with this method is that the measurement is quasi static, that is a level is applied as a step signal at the input and the output is measured when a stable signal is achieved. If the look-up table calculated in this way is used with a shaped pulse, this procedure is correct only if the response time of the compressor circuit is much shorter than the pulse. If this condition is not fulfilled, the compressor output at a time \(t\) depends on the input values in a finite interval before \(t\). Therefore the pulse is distorted and the optimal look-up table to minimize the distortion will depend on the actual pulse shape. Furthermore, this technique does not take into account possible skew rate limitations. If significant, they will give signal distortion depending on the signal amplitu

Figure 4: Look-up table expressed in Volt versus ADC counts for a compressor

As a result of the above mentioned processing errors, the compressors had a bandwidth well below the design value and with slew rate limitations.

In spite of these limitations, the relatively long shaping time of the Tile calorimeter shaper allow the use of a quasi static look-up table with good results, as shown below.

For the Accordion calorimeter, with its faster pulses, those amplitude dependent distortion effects are more evident. The search for the optimal look-up table is therefore important for the analysis. A technique to determine the optimal look-up table using the pulser data is described in [1].

Furthermore, data have been taken in the laboratory with input pulses closely reproducing the ones generated by the shapers of the Tile and Accordion calorimeters. The analysis at these data, to be used as a base for calculating more precise look-up tables, is ongoing.

Nevertheless the final solution to the problem will only be found when chips fullfilling the design specifications become available.

### Algorithms for energy and timing estimation

#### 3.2.1 Time estimator

The test setup included a TDC for measuring the phase of the trigger relative to the FERMI clock. However, due to limitations discussed in detail in [3], it was found that the most adequate way of knowing the timing of an event was the calculation of a timing estimator using the sampled data. The timing estimator, \(s\) in the following, is the difference between the two samples adjacent to the maximum divided by an estimator of the energy. This quantity has a non-linear dependence on the phase of the event. Yet, by assuming a random distribution of the phase, the timing of the event can be calculated from \(s\), following the prescriptions in [3].

The precision of \(s\) depends on the signal to noise ratio of the system and can be measured by fitting linearly the relation between TDC counts and \(s\) in an appropriate range. The precision is \(\approx 1.0\) ns.

#### 3.2.2 Energy estimator

The energy deposited in a cell is estimated through a filtering algorithm applied to the samples. The sources of measurement errors in a sampling system are basically three: jitter, electronic noise and pile-up. A detailed discussion on energy measurement in presence of various noise sources can be found in [9, 10] and references therein.

A simple and effective filter with a good rejection of jitter is the adder [3], i.e. the sum of \(n\) consecutive samples. The adder length is the only free parameter to be optimized, and it depends on the actual shape of the pulse. For the Tile calorimeter shaper a length of 8 samples turns out to be appropriate.

The residual timing dependence of this filter is shown in Fig.5 as the average ratio between FERMI data and Tile calorimeter data versus the timing estimator \(s\). The spread is about 0.5 % and this dependence can be parametrized and corrected for in the data, as is done in the analysis presented below. For the Accordion pulse, a length of 4 samples is sufficient, as it includes the whole positive lobe of the pulse shape. The plot of the residual timing dependence is shown in Fig.6 fitted with a parabola, showing a spread of about 1.4 %.

### Time and amplitude determination with fit

An alternative way to extract the timing and energy estimator is to use a theoretical shape to fit the samples contained in each frame. In the case of the Accordion calorimeter data, this shape has been taken from [9].

The fit generates the start time and the amplitude used to reconstruct the pulse shape. This approach proved especially effective in the case of the Accordion signal.

A preliminary step is the identification and removal of the events not consistent with being single pulses from the detector. A visual scan allows to exclude pedestal, cross-talk and multiple pulse events from the analysis.

In [11], the output of the Accordion preamplifier-shaper complex for an input triangular shaped current pulse is modelled as follows:

\[V(\boldsymbol{x}) = 0 \boldsymbol{x}<0\] \[V(\boldsymbol{x}) = -1+e^{-\boldsymbol{x}}\times(1+\boldsymbol{x}+\tfrac{\boldsymbol{ x}^{2}}{2}+\tfrac{\boldsymbol{x}^{3}}{6})+(1+\rho)\times\tfrac{\boldsymbol{x}^{4}}{24}) 0<\boldsymbol{x}\leq\rho \tag{1}\] \[V(\boldsymbol{x}) = e^{-\boldsymbol{x}}\times(\rho\tfrac{\boldsymbol{x}^{4}}{24}+1-e^ {\rho}+(\boldsymbol{x}-(\boldsymbol{x}-\rho)\times e^{\rho})\qquad\boldsymbol{ x}>\rho.\]

where \(t_{drift}\) is the fall time of the current pulse, \(t_{shape}\) is the shaper time constant, \(t_{samp}\) is the time between two different samples (here 25 ns), \(\boldsymbol{x}=(t-t_{0})/(t_{shape}\times t_{samp})\) and \(\rho=t_{drift}/t_{shape}\).

The shaped signal reaches its maximum at :

\[\boldsymbol{x}_{max}=\frac{4}{1+1/\rho}\]

with a value of

\[V(\boldsymbol{x}_{max})=-1+e^{-\boldsymbol{x}_{max}}\times(1+\boldsymbol{x}_{ max}+\frac{\boldsymbol{x}_{max}^{2}}{2}+\frac{\boldsymbol{x}_{max}^{3}}{6})+(1+ \rho)\frac{\boldsymbol{x}_{max}^{4}}{24}).\]

Letting unconstrained the electron drift time \(t_{drift}\) and the shaper time constant \(t_{shape}\) during the fit, these parameters can be extracted directly from the data and the results are shown in Table 2. At the same time, energy and timing estimators are generated. However, these estimators can be improved, by using the values of the drift time and of the shaper time constant previously found, and rerunning the fit.

The physical parameters extracted in Tab.2 are consistent with the values expected from the design of the detector.

### Signal shape

The pulse shape and its dependence on the amplitude are an important element for the optimization of the analysis. The most effective approach is to measure it directly from the data taken in the experimental setup.

A technique exploiting the timing measurement for each event is described in detail in [3]. Two variants of this technique have been studied, differing in the normalization procedures. In one, the samples used to reconstruct the pulse shape are normalized using the energy estimator. This approach reduces the noise on the pulse shape, but modulates the pulse shape with the dependence of the energy estimator on the phase. In the other, no normalization is applied and therefore no phase dependent bias is introduced, but the shape contains more noise.

With the Tile calorimeter shaper, the phase dependence of the energy estimator, represented in Fig.5, is small enough so that the shape distortion is negligible. Therefore the first variant is used to obtain, from physics data, the pulse shape of the Tile calorimeter as shown in Fig.7.

For the Accordion shaper, the phase dependence is much more significant, and the best way to obtain a clean pulse shape is to make use of pulser data normalized with their known aamplitude. This is shown in Fig.8 for the Spanish Fan shaper. With real data, the pulse reconstruction is more difficult due to the jitter dependence, statistical limitations and spurious pulses (e.g. pile-up), limiting the quality of the pulse reconstruction. An example is shown in Fig.9. More details on the limitations of this method are presented in [3].

This method of pulse reconstruction also allows to study the amplitude dependence of the pulse shape. The most effective approach is the use of sequences of pulses with known amplitudes and reconstruct separately the pulse shapes for each amplitude. A significant amount of pulser data was taken only for the Spanish Fan prototype of the Accordion calorimeter. It is also in principle possible to make use of physics data, selecting the events through an energy estimator, but such method is complex and only a limited amplitude range is available in the data acquired.

For the Tile calorimeter, we can conclude that the amplitude dependent distortions of the pulse shape are small within the amplitude range acquired during these runs. For a more complete study, data taken in the laboratory with a calibrated pulser followed by a Tile calorimeter shaper will be analysed.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Detector & Shaping time (ns) & Drift time (ns) \\ \hline \hline Fresnel Lens channel 1 & 11.6 & 397 \\ \hline Fresnel Lens channel 2 & 11.8 & 395 \\ \hline Spanish Fan channel 1 & 11.6 & 601 \\ \hline Spanish Fan channel 2 & 11.7 & 586 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 9: Pulse shape of the Spanish Fan shaper with a 200 GeV electron beam.

The pulse shape reconstruction technique can also be used to correct the look-up table based on laboratory data, adapting it to any given pulse shape. The basic idea is that the optimal look-up table should minimize the amplitude dependent distortion and this can be done by using the entries of the look-up table as free parameters in order to minimize the differences between pulse shapes reconstructed at different amplitudes. This approach is followed in [1], where the look-up table for one channel is recalculated making use of pulser data.

This optimization depends on the pulse shape and is therefore correct only for the used shaper; the corrected look-up tables will therefore always be used for data taken with the Accordion shapers. For the Tile calorimeter shaper, the lack of good pulser data does not allow a recalculation of the look-up table and therefore the quasi static one will be used.

## 4 Tile calorimeter

### Muons

During the data taking with the Tile calorimeter, about 40000 events were recorded with a muon beam. The two FERMI channels were connected to the two sides of the same calorimeter tower, so that both measured the same energy. In case of muons, having a very low signal and a broad Landau distribution, the main source of error is the electronic noise since the systematic effects are proportional to the energy and have little effect on the precision of the measurement.

For these reasons, we concentrate on the search of the optimum algorithm for measuring a signal in presence of electronic noise, and do not investigate alternative possibilities conceived to reduce systematic effects. In [2] it is shown that the combination of the two signals maximizing the signal over noise ratio is \(S1+\lambda S2\), where S1 and S2 are the signals on the two channels, having noise N1 and N2, respectively, and \(\lambda=\overline{(S2/N2)/(S1/N1)}\), i.e. the ratio of the average values of the signal over noise ratios. The signal is defined as the maximum of a given energy estimator, while the noise is estimated by applying the energy estimator to a range of samples where no physical signal is expected.

As stated above, we limit ourselves to consider adders as energy estimators. Hence the only parameter to be optimized is the length of the adder. In order to do this we have to define the quality factor of the filter. The ones with a direct physical meaning are the fraction of muon events lost for a given fraction of noise events passing the cut, shown in Fig.10, or the fraction of noise events accepted for a given fraction of muons lost, shown in Fig.11. These figures agree in showing that filter lengths shorter than 3 samples are not effective and very unstable, while lengthsFigure 10: Fraction of noise events accepted by applying a cut giving a loss of a given fraction of muon events versus the filter length

longer than or equal to 3 samples show a smooth behaviour with an optimum value at 3.

### Electrons

#### 4.2.1 Physics resolution

Data were taken with the Tile calorimeter turned 90\({}^{\circ}\) with respect to the beam and with the first two longitudinal compartments instrumented.

The electrons deposit about 80 % of their energy in the first compartment, and roughly 20 % in the second compartments, as can be seen in Fig.12, where the spectra of the energy deposition in the two compartments are shown. The quantity plotted is the value in Volt of the 8 point adder. This convention will be kept throughout

Figure 11: Inefficiency in detecting muons by applying a cut giving an acceptance of a given fraction of noise events versus the filter length

the following paragraphs. The conversion factor to energy is \(\approx 100\)\(\mathrm{GeV}/\mathrm{V}\).

The two channels need to be equalized. This is performed by weighting the second compartment with respect to the first in such a way that, for any sharing of the energy between the two channels, the sum of the two has, in average, the same value. The peak for 100 GeV electrons after equalization is shown in Fig. 13. The spread is \(\approx 6.3\,\%\). Such a value is higher than the \(\approx 3\)\(\%\) expected from Monte Carlo. This is justified by the fact that, with only two channels, the energy deposition in the third longitudinal compartment is neglected, and the compartments are read only from one side, thus adding a dependence from the energy response on the impact point along the compartment.

Using the combined data from the two compartments, the same analysis has been performed on the RD34 data. (In the following we will use the name 'RD34 data' for the data digitized with the CAEN ADC used by the RD34 collaboration, and 'FERMI data', for the same data digitized using FERMI.) In Fig.14 the peak of the FERMI data is shown superimposed to the RD34 data. The two peaks are statistically compatible at the level of 96 \(\%\) using the Kolmogorov test.

#### 4.2.2 Linearity and resolution

Shown in Fig.15 is the correlation between FERMI and RD34 data for the two channels available during the July test.

The correlation is very good over the whole energy range covered in the run, approximately 25 \(\%\) of the full dynamic range of the RD34 ADCs. In order to evaluate in detail the quality of the correlation, the relative deviations from a linear fit to the plot of Fig.15 is shown in Fig.16. The maximum deviation is of the order of \(\pm\) 0.5 \(\%\). In order to increase the dynamic range of the RD34 data, the signal from each photomultiplier is split into two paths, amplified by a factor 1 and \(\approx 7\) respectively, and fed into two separate ADCs. The data used in the comparison were, for the low part of the range, coming from the amplified path, and for the high part of the range from the non amplified one.

Various possible explanations for the residual non-linearity have been investigated. In particular, we tried to evaluate whether part of the non-linearity could be ascribed to the RD34 ADC.

We performed a comparison with the amplified channel alone, covering approximately half of the accessible range of the acquired data. In this region the deviation from linearity over the full range of the RD34 ADC is in the order of 0.1\(\%\). This result shows the excellent linearity of the CAEN ADC over the full range, and likewise, the very good performance of the FERMI ADC in the first linear region of the transfer function shown in Fig.4.

Figure 19: Energies deposited in the Channel 1, Channel 2 and their sum.

Fig.19 shows the energy deposited in the two channels as measured by the Accordion DAQ and their sum. The two channels were equalized requiring the average values of the distributions of the ratios between the FERMI and Accordion measurements be equal.

The linearity of the system is estimated through the energy dependence of the average value of the ratio between the FERMI and Accordion measurements. The error introduced by FERMI is estimated through the spread of the same ratio.

In Fig. 20 the ratio of FERMI to Accordion measurements (normalized to 1) is plotted versus the energy measured by the Accordion. A non linearity at the few percent level is visible at low energies, but this region includes only a small fraction of the events. At higher energies, the measurements show that the linearity of FERMI is better than 1%.

This small non linearity could be easily corrected during the analysis, but this

Figure 20: Ratio between FERMI and Accordion measurements versus energy

would contradict the FERMI approach of correcting all the non linearities of the system in the look-up table. Therefore the most appropriate way of removing it would be to recalculate the look-up table. This is fairly complicated and, because of the small contribution, is not done here.

A plot of the ratio for all energies is shown in Fig. 21 both for the two channels separately and their sum. A significant improvement can be obtained considering only the events with an energy above a threshold at 30 GeV in each channel or larger than 50 GeV for the sum. The same plots are shown in Fig. 22. The spread on the ratio versus energy is shown in Fig. 25.

In trying to identify the causes of the spread, we investigated the dependence of the ratio on the timing estimator \(s\) for each channel separately and for their sum. The results for the sum is shown in Fig. 5. A parabolic fit can be used to correct the data on an event by event basis.

The distribution of the ratios for all energies above threshold and the dependence of the energy spread are shown in Figs. 23, 24, 26 with the data corrected for the timing dependence by the energy estimator. These figures show a marked improvements when compared to Figs. 21, 22, 25. In particular, the asymptotic error at high energy decrease from \(\approx\) 2% to \(\approx\) 1.2%.

## 6 Conclusions

Early prototypes of the calorimeter electronics developed by RD16 (FERMI) have been tested in a test beam with Tile and Accordion calorimeter prototypes.

Data taken with the Tile calorimeter, both with muons and electrons show that the performances of the FERMI electronics are perfectly adequate and approach the design figure, in spite of possible contributions from the RD34 electronics itself. In a event-by-event comparison between FERMI and RD34 data, a asymptotic spread of 0.6% at high energies has been measured. Electron data with the Accordion prototypes demonstrate that it still has some limitations, caused by bandwidth and slew rate being below design specification. These problems are particularly evident with the Accordion fast read out electronics. In an event by event comparison a spread of 1.2% at high energy has been measured.

Both pedestal stability and noise was analyzed. The stability is excellent with no detectable drift and the noise contribution from the complete electronics chain, preamplifier, shaper, compresssor and ADC was found to be 1.6 LSB.
