**Abstract**

The straws in the TRT will generate heat that has to be removed from the detector volume to ensure stable conditions. In this report we define the boundary conditions from mechanical and physics requirements taking the barrel TRT as example.

Calculations on the heat generated in the straws and its function of radius, total heat generation and the temperature distribution in the detector volume with and without active cooling are performed. Different cooling schemes are proposed and the required gas flows for these schemes are calculated. The size of the services for two different cooling schemes is discussed.

## 1 Distribution of Power Dissipation

The expected rate for the inner (\(r=0.63\) m) and outer (\(r=1.07\) m) straw layer is

2x1.5 x10\({}^{7}\) s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) and 2x3.8x10\({}^{6}\) s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) respectively [1]. The power dissipation in the 1.6 m long barrel straws follows from:

\[W=Gain\times N\times Rate\times V\times q \tag{1}\]

where N is the _mean_ number of ions produced per hit in the straw, V is the anode wire potential and q is the deposited electron charge. With Gain = 4x10\({}^{4}\), N = 65,

V = 1800 V and Rate = 3.0x10\({}^{7}\) s\({}^{\text{-1}}\) (inner layer) we obtain W = 22 mW. Assuming that the rate per straw varies with radius as

\[Rate\propto\frac{1}{r^{a}}\,, \tag{2}\]

the rates for the inner and outer layer above give \(a\approx 2.51\). This gives a heat distribution as shown in figure 1 and the total power dissipation in the barrel is 574 W.

The above calculated heat dissipation and rates are the inputs in the calculations of the temperature distribution, cooling requirements, etc. throughout the paper.

## 2 Temperature Distribution in the Barrel TRT

Due to the heat produced in the straws and in absence of any internal cooling mechanism, the temperature will rise in the detector volume until a steady state is reached. The generated heat (Q) has the radial dependency calculated above i.e.,

\[Q(r)=\frac{q}{r^{2.51}}\]

Assuming a long hollow cylinder with outer (\(r=1.07\) m) and inner (\(r=0.63\) m) wall temperature of \(~{}20~{}^{\circ}\)C. The temperature as a function of radius can be calculated, assuming a mean thermal conductivity in the material, \(\lambda\), equal to 0.05 W/m/K. The temperature equation in cylindrical coordinates

\[\frac{1}{r}\times\left[\frac{d}{dr}\times\left(r\times\frac{d}{dr}T(r)\right) \right]+\frac{q}{\lambda\times r^{2.51}}=0 \tag{3}\]

gives the temperature distribution

\[T(r)=-2.353\times\frac{\left[3181~{}+1.799\times\ln(r)\times r^{\left(\frac{51 }{100}\right)}\right]}{r^{\left(\frac{51}{100}\right)}}+7538 \tag{4}\]

shown in figure 2.

Figure 1: Heat dissipation per straw as a function of radius.

This gives a maximum temperature difference of about 75 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The calculation of T(\(r\)) is shown in more detail in Appendix A.

## 3 Constrains From Mechanical Tolerances

### Detector Components

The most important task in designing the barrel TRT is to ensure stability of the wire positions down to 40 \(\upmu\)m. Thermal expansion of the detector components will degrade the positioning of the wires and the detector performance. Detector components of interest are summarized in table 1[2]. It is assumed that the temperature variation with time is not larger than the temperature differences inside the detector volume. The thermal elongation, \(\Delta l\), is calculated from

\[\Delta l=\alpha\times l\times\Delta T \tag{5}\]

where \(\alpha\) is the coefficient of linear expansion.

### Straw Walls

The reinforced straws are very resistant to temperature changes compared to the Kapton straw, as can be seen from table 1. For the reinforced straw this means a change in length of

\[\Delta l=1K\times 1.6m\times 6\times 10^{-6}\ /\ K=10\upmu m \tag{6}\]

for a temperature change of 1 \({}^{\circ}\)C. A 100 \(\upmu\)m change in straw length, corresponding to a temperature variation of 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C is acceptable for the 1.6 m long barrel straws.

Figure 2: The temperature distribution in the barrel TRT assuming a long hollow cylinder with the boundaries fixed at 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

**Anode Wire**

For the Cu-Be wire the thermal expansion is given by

\[\Delta l=1K\times 1.6m\times 16\times 10^{-6}\ /\ K\approx 26\upmu m \tag{7}\]

for a temperature change of 1 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

A change in elongation for a 50 \(\upmu\)m diameter wire then corresponds to a force (F) and

\[F=A\times E\times\Delta l=\pi\times r^{2}\times E\times\Delta l \tag{8}\]

where E is Young's modulus for Cu-Be, r the wire radius and \(\Delta l\) the thermal expansion from (7). For E = 21x10\({}^{10}\) N/m\({}^{2}\), r = 25 \(\upmu\)m and \(\Delta l\) = 26 \(\upmu\)m we obtain F = 0.010 N for 1 \({}^{\circ}\)C temperature change, which is \(\sim\) 2 % of the wire tension if the wires are pretensioned to 50 g. A temperature change of 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C should be acceptable.

**Foam Radiator**

The most worrying material from a mechanical point of view is the radiator. The radiator is made in blocks with precision drilled holes for the straws with a diameter of 4.8 mm. This leaves a clearance between a reinforced straw and radiator of 200 \(\upmu\)m.

The radiator is made in blocks, approximately 10 cm x 10 cm x 10 cm and the drilling accuracy is \(\sim\)60 \(\upmu\)m for the holes [4]. The elongation per 1 \({}^{\circ}\)C over 10 cm foam is given by

\[\Delta l=1K\times 0.1m\times 120\times 10^{-6}\ /\ K\approx 12\upmu m \tag{9}\]

and with 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C temperature change this is 120 \(\upmu\)m. Taking into the account the drilling accuracy, a temperature change of 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C is acceptable with a clearance of 200 \(\upmu\)m. However, it should be noted that this acceptable temperature is critically dependent on the construction method chosen.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|} \hline Component & Material & Thermal expansion \\  & & coefficient (1/K) \\ \hline Support structure & 60\% carbon fiber 40\% & -0.42x10\({}^{-6}\)/ 30x10\({}^{-6}\) \\  & epoxy & (along /orthogonal to fiber) \\ \hline Kapton straw (no & Kapton & 3x10\({}^{-4}\) \\ reinforcement) & & \\ \hline Reinforced straw & Kapton + carbon fiber + & 6x10\({}^{-6}\) \\  & epoxy & \\ \hline Anode wire & Cu-Be & 16x10\({}^{-6}\) \\ \hline Anode wire & Tungsten & 4.3x10\({}^{-6}\) \\ \hline Radiator & Polypropylene foam & 120x10\({}^{-6}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Support Structure

The support structure is somewhat decoupled from the problem of cooling the detector volume but, nevertheless the expected elongation from temperature changes is reported. It is reasonable to assume that the outer structure can be kept at a stable temperature. If one assumes that the carbon fiber direction can be chosen to decrease the effect of thermal expansion, then the main uncertainty is the effect of thermal expansion in the nodes, see figure 4. Taking a worst case where the nodes occupy 10% of the radial extension and a \(\alpha=30\)x\(10^{-6}\) /K. For a temperature change of \(1\)\({}^{\circ}\)C the total elongation in r is

\[\Delta l=1K\times 0.04m\times 30\times 10^{-6}\ /\ K=1.2\upmu m\,. \tag{10}\]

For a temperature change of \(10\)\({}^{\circ}\)C, the upper limit for deformation is 12 \(\upmu\)m, which is acceptable.

## 4 Constrains From Straw Performance

To evaluate the cooling needs of the barrel TRT, it is necessary to investigate how temperature variations along the straws influence the physics performance. The gas gain uniformity should remain constant as far as possible. The question is; how do variations in gas temperature affect the gas gain? Resent results show that, for a gas

Figure 4: Support structure geometry for the barrel TRT.

gain of 3x10\({}^{4}\), a gas gain dependency of 2.4 % / \({}^{\circ}\)C for a 50 \(\mu\)m diameter wire and 1.5%/ \({}^{\circ}\)C for a 30 \(\mu\)m wire [5].

### Influence on Electron Identification

If we allow a change in gas gain of \(\sim\) 24% we get a limit on the gas gain of 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C for the 50 \(\mu\)m wire and 15 \({}^{\circ}\)C for the 30 \(\mu\)m wire. How the gas gain affects the electron identification is shown in figure 5, where the pion efficiency is shown as a function of gain variation along the in the barrel TRT, as estimated from test beam. A 25% gain variation is clearly acceptable and therefore also a 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C temperature variation. If the gas gain is increased even further, the probability for streamer increases leading to heating and premature aging of the straws. Some margin is also necessary as there are other effects that alter gas uniformity, for example deflection of the anode wire, bending in the straws etc.

### Drift Time Accuracy

A gain variation corresponds to a variation threshold for drift time measurements. How this affects the resolution is shown in figure 6. A gain variation of 25 % will change the resolution with 10 \(\mu\)m, which is neglectable. A 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C temperature variation is therefore acceptable.

## 5 Cooling Requirements and Schemes

### Introduction

Several sources contribute to the error of wire positioning and straw performance and the errors caused by the temperature differences should be kept small compared to these. The requirements above give an acceptable temperature difference of about 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C and figure 2 in section 2 shows clearly the need of cooling inside the detector volume. Three possible ways for cooling are described below. For simplicity CO\({}_{2}\) is used for cooling outside the straws and Xe is used in the calculation of cooling with the detector gas.

### Cooling Module Boundaries

If the same calculation of section 2 is carried out for the inner module i.e.,

T(\(r=0.630\) m) = T( \(r=0.752\) m) = 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C, the maximum temperature difference in \(r\) is then reduced to below 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C (see figure 7). The calculation is made for the inner module as it is the most critical because of the high rate. Additional cooling can be obtained by cooling all four sides of the module and this will decrease the radial temperature difference in the module below 5 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

Figure 6: Drift time accuracy as a function of discriminator threshold [6].

### Cooling Individual Straws

Two possible ways of cooling the straws with a flow of gas have been studied. In one scheme the detector gas (Xe) is used. A second scheme uses CO\({}_{2}\) that is blown outside, along the straws to maintain the temperature difference in the straw below 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The required gas flow per straw as a function of radius is shown in figure 8 and is obtained from

\[W=C_{{}_{p}}\times\dot{M}\times\Delta T \tag{11}\]

where W is the power dissipation, C\({}_{p}\) is the specific heat, \(\dot{M}\) is the gas flow in mass per second. The total power dissipation of 574 W gives a total gas flow of 0.07 kg/s of CO\({}_{2}\) and 0.342 kg/s of Xe i.e., 41 l/s and 63 l/s at NPT. This is if one uses only the detector gas as cooling method. More details can be found in Appendix B. This values assume an optimized gas flow through the detector according to figure 8.

#### 5.2.1 Cooling With the Detector Gas

One problem with this system is to find enough pumping power (dry pumps) for this high gas flow. The maximum pumping capacity that has so far been found on the market is \(\sim\) 3.3 l/s ( at 1 bar). The pressure drops are significantly higher in the pipe work, 5.6 times, for the same cooling power with Xe (table 2 ). This means more space and material is required with Xe gas cooling.

Figure 7: The temperature distribution for an inner module with an inner outer radius of 0.63 m and 0.752 m respectively.

#### 5.2.2 Cooling With CO\({}_{2}\) Outside the Straws

Another way of cooling the straws is to blow CO\({}_{2}\) between the straws and the foam. The holes in the foam are assumed to be 4.8 mm in diameter and this gap allows a flow of gas around each straw. A flow of 41 l/s NPT for the hole detector is needed for a temperature difference of 10\({}^{\circ}\)C (section 5.2). The pressure drop in the detector volume i.e., between the straws and the foam in the case of CO\({}_{2}\) cooling is small. Calculation of the pressure drop is performed in Appendix C. Experimental values confirm these calculations [4]. The flow around the straws can be decreased by a factor two by having input at both ends of the detector and output in the middle (\(z=0\)). The _total_ gas flow in and out of the detector volume of course stays the same. With CO\({}_{2}\) cooling, standard compressors can be used to circulate the gas as the purity demands are smaller and high flow can easily be obtained. The cleaning of the radiator from Xe is done with the cooling gas.

## 6 Service Estimate

In figure 9 the pipe work to bring in the cooling gas to the detector area is shown and the different sections are market with numbers. The gas input is assumed to be at one end of the detector and the output at the other end. The pipe dimensions, bending etc. are summarized together with the pressure drops in table 2. It is far from complete (no branches for example) but it gives an idea of the pressure drop in the services. The calculation is done until the crack region were a more detailed study of the gas distribution system is required. More details on the calculations of the pressure drops are given in Appendix D.

Figure 8: Required gas flow per straw as a function of radius with a maximum \(\Delta\)T = 10\({}^{\circ}\)C along the straws.

## Conclusions

An active cooling is needed to bring down the temperature differences in the straws to an acceptable value. A flow of CO\({}_{2}\) gas outside the straws or cooling the module boundaries seems preferable.
