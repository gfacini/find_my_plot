**SUMMARY OF THE LHCC-MAGNET PANEL-ATLAS MEETING, DECEMBER 1, 1992 AT CERN**

This note is to summarize the main points, which were discussed in the meeting. My personal, perhaps biased, impression was very positive. The panel made clear, that both options (air core toroids, iron core toroids) are technically feasible, their estimated costs are reasonable, perhaps a bit on the lower side, and their operation is safe within expected standards. The operations cost for the air core magnets is somewhat less than for the iron core magnets. I had the impression, that the LHCC magnet panel will give a positive statement for both solutions to the LHCC. It is up to our collaboration to make the right choice in view of the physics we want to explore with the LHC.

Here is a short summary of the various discussion points (see also attached program).

1. Safety margin and necessary R & D commented by P. Komarek

The proposed air core toroids are using a relatively classical design for the conductor. This means, that the problems are known and precautions can be made to avoid them. Concerning the quench protection the toroid coils are as safe as classical solenoid coils (3000 J/m\({}^{3}\) should be o.k.).

The worst possible accident would be a conductor-conductor short. This would inevitably destroy the coil. However, neighbouring coils and also people will not be hurt. It was recommended to provide a magnet structure, which can take the forces from the outside, if such an accident occurs.

R & D on conductor extrusion (for a conductor length of about 100 m) should be done before going out for tender. The estimated cost for such R & D is 1 Mo. SFR.

2. **Cool down time, switch off time and recovery time after quench** commented by H. Desportes and E. Baynham

a) Barrel air core toroid

The cool down time of 400 tons of material will be about 1 month. The cooling down time depends on the cooling power of the refrigerator. It could be shortened at higher cost. This is perhaps not necessary, because normally a magnet is cooled down only once and forever.

The current ramping will take about 2 hours. For faster ramping (Eddy current limit - 1 hour) one needs a more powerful power supply. Switching off the magnet current will take somewhat longer, unless special systems are used.

The quench recovery (cool down time from 50 K to 4 K) will take about 5 days. It depends again on the available cooling power.

b. End cap air core toroids

The corresponding cool down time for the end cap toroids is estimated to be 2 weeks, depending on the available cooling power. The quench recovery will be about 10 hours, the ramping up time 1 hour and the switch off time 2 hours (use of a passive system). For comparison the ALEPH s.c. solenoid cools down in less than a week. Never any quench occured sofar.

## 3 Barrel-end cap interferences, movement of cold end cap toroids

commented by E. Baynham

The flux and force calculations have been started, but it is too early to have results now. For a warm end cap/barrel interference the forces do not look frightening. An air core barrel quench does not seem to be a problem for warm end cap toroids. Fields at the flux return yoke of the solenoid from the end cap and the barrel are of the order of 0.5 - 1.0 T. The forces have not been calculated yet (see attached Fig.).

The movement (4 - 6 meter) of the cold end cap toroids is in principle possible, but it needs further study. It was felt, that in this case the current connections need to be removed.

4. **Force calculations, mechanical tolerances and magnet/muon chamber interferences** commented by H. Desportes The questioned factor of two between the RAL and Saclay force calculations is nothing to worry about. The values converge, when using the same assumptions. Detailed force calculations have been started now, since the design parameters are better known. Concerning the mechanical tolerances, the structure movement tolerances and the temperature stabilisation outside the cryostat, we should define our needs. It was mentioned, that a movement of the order of 1 - 2 mm can be tracked by the muon chamber alignement system. Vibrations have not been studied yet. The mechanical support for 200 tons of muon chambers does not seem to be a problem. The first fringe field calculations of the air core barrel toroid are shown in the attached Fig. 5. **Thickness of vacuum vessel and of radiation shield. Radiation hardness of resins.** commented by E. Baynham The thickness of the end plates of the vacuum vessel will be 110 mm and the inner tube 20 - 30 mm. The thickness of the radiation shield will be about 20 mm. The radiation hardness of insulator resins (G10) has been tested up to 5 - 10\({}^{8}\) rad (but not with neutrons!). A reduction of the resistivity of 25% was observed. The radiation hardness of the resin is also important in fusion reactor magnets. The neutron fluences are > 10\({}^{18}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\). It was said, that 10\({}^{9}\) rad should not be exceeded. 6. **Tests prior to installation** commented by H. Desportes a. Barrel air core toroid All coils need to be tested individually before the toroid assembly. These tests could also be done in the manufacturing companies, if the necessary cryogenic equipment exist. It is however prefered, that these tests are performed at CERN after the transport of the coils from the manufacturing companies. For the test at CERN a refrigeration system is needed. This can be the final refrigerator of the magnet. But also an existing refrigerator can be considered (Saclay of CERN). For the tests (2.5 month/coil) a total of about 2 years is estimated.

b. Cold end cap toroids

The situation for the end cap toroids is somewhat different, since they are contained in one cryostat. Each of these end cap magnets needs to be tested also at CERN before installation.

The tests and the assembly of the iron core or air core magnets need space, equipment, infrastructure and manpower from CERN.

## 6 Magnetic field measurements

commented by E. Klimenko

For details, see paper distributed by E. Klimenko. The knowledge of the field with an accuracy of \(\Delta\)B/B \(<\) 1% is needed for \(\Delta\)p\({}_{\sqrt{2}}\)/p\({}_{\sqrt{2}}\) - 2%. A large number of distributed sensors (- 10\({}^{4}\)) have to be employed. The main concern about the sensors are the cost (10 SFR/sensor), the sensitivity and the temperature dependence.

## 7 Construction time, installation time, cost estimates and uncertainties, global risk assessments

commented by T. Taylor

The construction and installation times are reasonable as they are given in the document. A construction time of 6 - 7 years for the air core toroid is needed. Therefore it is important to make decisions fast. The estimated assembly time for the magnets looks reasonable. The integration of the detectors is more complicated than the installation of the magnets themselves. The integration is an important issue, which needs to be studied in detail.

The cost estimations look o.k., but they should be considered as lower limits. This is also true for the iron toroids. Since the cost for the iron toroids is mainly due to material (Fe), the Fe prices may change at a later time (we are now in a recession, where prices are low). The uncertainty of the cost estimates of all magnets is in the order of 20%.

The global risks are not large in either case (iron core or air core toroids).

The needed infrastructure from CERN is large for either choice. This should be taken into account in a more careful cost estimate. Previous experience showed, that H1 and ALEPH magnet costs were underestimated in actual manpower.

P. Lazeyras commented, that for the ALEPH magnet only 12 out of 5300 operation hours were lost. Excellent performance was obtained by the s.c. BEBC magnet during 10 years of operation.

## 8 Operations cost

commented by P. Lazeyras

The estimated operations cost for the iron core and the air core toroids is about the same. Perhaps the cost for the air core toroid is somewhat less. The electrical power will be 1.3 MW for the air core toroids and 4 MW for the iron core toroids. The smaller power bill in the case of the air core toroid will be almost compensated by the higher man power and maintenance costs (refrigerator system). As an example the operating costs per year of the ALEPH-magnet are about 250 KSFR. (electrical power) + 500 KSFR. (maintenance) + the salary of 3 people (full time).

## 9 Communication of critical issues

It is planned to have industrial consultations with industry for a better cost estimate. This will be done by Saclay and RAL.

The magnet designers want from us a list of requirements concerning structure movement tolerances, temperature stabilisation outside cryostats, support systems for muon chambers etc....

The LHCC magnet panel is planning to prepare a written report by the middle of February 1993.
