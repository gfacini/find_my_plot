The ATLAS TileCal digitizer boards are designed to compensate for time delays in the calorimeter modules. In this report a method is described to determine the time delays and how to correct for them. The analysis is made using testbeam pion data from 2002 and 2003. The result shows that the sampling clock of the digitizers in the barrel calorimeter can be adjusted in such a way that there always is one sample within 1.5 ns from the pulse peak.

Introduction

### TileCal

The ATLAS Tile Calorimeter [1] is a cylindrical structure divided into one barrel and two extended barrel segments. Each segment consists of 64 wedge shaped modules. The module itself is made as a sandwich of iron plates with scintillating plastic tiles in between. The light produced when charged particles cross the scintillators is brought out to PMTs in the back of the module by wavelength shifting fibers. PMTs, supply electronics and read-out electronics are mounted on an aluminum girder called drawer. The drawer slides into a compartment in the back of the module. A super-drawer consists of two drawers. Each barrel module contains two super-drawers equipped with 45 channels each while the extended barrel module contains only one super-drawer with 32 channels. A so called 3-in-1 card [2] attached to the PMT base amplifies and shapes the PMT signal. Each 3-in-1 card has four outputs: the trigger sum signal connected to a summation unit for the Level-1 trigger system [3], a signal for calibration and two for the digitizer units [4, 5, 6]. The two digitizer outputs have different gains, low and high, with an amplification ratio of 64 to achieve a greater dynamic range of the signal. The two digitizer signals from the the 3-in-1 card are digitized by the digitizer units.

One barrel super-drawer contains eight digitizer boards. Each digitizer board has six high gain and six low gain channels. The Timing, Trigger and Control (TTC) system[7, 8] provides a 40 MHz clock to the digitizer boards. The clock signal is transmitted to the front end electronics via an optical link. The receiver board connects to the two digitizer boards in the center of the super-drawer. From here the TTC signal propagates to adjacent digitizer boards via a passive LVDS bus. Because of the path length difference the TTC signal phase must be corrected for each digitizer board.

### Timing on the digitizer boards

Calorimeter geometrical effects give rise to time differences for signals in the various drawer channels. This has to be adjusted for. The optimal filter used to extract the pulse amplitude has its best performance if the top sample is within 3 ns from the pulse peak[9]. To achieve this each digitizer board uses a TTC-receiver ASIC (TTC-rx)[10]. The TTC-rx decodes the TTC signal into three clocks: system-, clock40des1- and clock40des2-clock. All three clocks run at 40 MHz but clock40des1 and clock40des2 can be shifted in phase relative to the system clock. The clock40des2 clock is used to clock the analog to digital converters (ADC:s). By changing the clock40des2 clock the sample phase can be tuned to achieve the best timing for the digitizer board. Ideally, this is when all channels have a sample at the top of the pulse. A problem is that the digitizer boards have only one TTC-rx ASIC. Thus the clock40des2 setting will affect all six high-gain and all six low-gain channels. Another problem is that the timing between the low- and high-gain channels differs with about 1.7 ns (see section 3). High- and low-gains are analyzed separately.

On the digitizer boards a digital pipeline memory stores up to about 6.4 \(\mu\)s of data. The pipeline memory depth can be set in steps of 25 ns and compensates, in a sense, for the long time latency of the first level trigger. Since the clock40des2 phase is set to tune the sample timing within an interval of 25 ns there are situations when both the clock40des2clock and the pipeline memory depth must be changed to obtain the correct timing for the whole drawer (see section 3.3).

### Test Beam Setup

In the 2002 and 2003 TileCal test-beam [11] area four calorimeter modules were placed on top of a table, see Figure 1. The bottom one is a reference module (module zero) which is a barrel module used in all measurements. Above module zero one barrel module is placed and on the top two extended barrel modules. The table can move in the z-direction and rotate in \(\theta\)-angle where the z-axis is defined as the perpendicular axis relative to the beam and parallel with the floor and the \(\theta\)-angle is defined as the angle between the z-axis and the calorimeter module front-face. The table can be tipped, raised and lowered, so all modules can be tested. By moving and rotating the table, the modules can be positioned such that for each cell the true ATLAS \(\eta\)-direction can be achieved. The \(\eta\)-direction is defined as \(\eta=-ln(tan(\theta_{ATLAS})/2)\) where \(\theta_{ATLAS}\) is the polar angle to the ATLAS beam axis. This analysis uses the kind of run, called \(\eta\)-scan, where the beam direction is parallel to the ATLAS \(\eta\) direction and sweeps form \(\eta\)=0.85 to \(\eta\)=-0.85 for the barrel module and from \(\eta\)=\(\pm\)0.85 to \(\eta\)=\(\pm\)1.45 for the extended barrel modules. The positive and negative \(\eta\)-parts of the module are called P and N sides respectively, see Figure 2. The P and N sides of the barrel each houses one super-drawer.

Figure 3 shows a schematic picture of the master trigger. The master trigger (MTRG) is set by the coincidence of the beam counters S1, S2 and S3. S1, S2 and S3 are the signals from scintillators that are placed in the beam line. For analysis purpose a Time to Digital Converter (TDC) [12] was used to measure the time difference between the TTC clock edge and the master trigger. It is called TDC\({}_{TTC}\). For July 2003 test period a TDC called TDC\({}_{S3}\) measured the time between S3 and the master trigger.

## 2 Method

In ATLAS the TTC-clock and the beam will be synchronized. In test-beam the TTC-clock and the beam are not synchronized and the phase of the sampling clock relative to the arrival of the beam is not trivial to find. In this analysis the relative timing between the drawer channels is evaluated. The task is to find the time between the beam arrival and the pulse peak for each cell. Data from three test beam periods are analyzed: July 2002, July 2003 and the 25-ns run from May 2003. The 2002 runs have most data but some hardware important to understand the timing was missing. The data set includes a barrel module and an extended barrel module. July 2003 only includes data from a barrel module but has more information to understand the timing. In the 25-ns run the beam and the TTC-clock was synchronized making the analysis much easier. The 25-ns run has only data from a barrel module. Because of the lack of extended barrel data only the timing for the barrel module was analyzed. To reject bad data in the analysis some standard cuts used are tabulated in table 4.

### The TTC phase relative to the Master Trigger

The time between the master trigger and a TTC-clock flank is measured by the \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) with a resolution of \(\sim\)1 ns. Figure 4 shows the \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) signal for July 2002 data. The \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) distribution is a sum of two flat uncorrelated distributions. The first is coming from the trigger and the second from the TTC signal. The \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) starts on a TTC clock flank and restarts every 60 ns. The TTC clock has a cycle of 25 ns. The trigger can arrive anytime within this 60 ns window resulting in a trapezoid shaped distribution with the base of 85 ns.

The \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) distribution for July 2003 data is shown in figure 5. The difference between the \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) signals for the July 2003 and July 2002 is that the TDC window size is decreased from 60 ns to 25 ns for July 2003 data. The two peaks to the left and to the right in the 2003 data are not understood and are probably due to a failing TDC.

### The Calculated Time

#### 2.2.1 Reconstruction of the pulse shape

Since the beam is random with respect to the TTC-clock, the pulse will be sampled at random phase, see figure 6. A pulse is digitized with about five samples at 40 MHz. So the time between a sample and its neighbors is 25 ns. The phase is estimated by the \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) value. Now, by plotting the sample values of the pulses versus the sum of the phase and the sample number times 25 ns, we obtain a pulse as shown in figure 7.

The pulse height is proportional to the energy, so data has to be divided into small energy intervals, see figure 8.

Intervals of 10 GeV estimated as the sum of five of the samples of the pulse was used for the reconstruction. To get the fully reconstructed pulse, the pulse for each energy interval is normalized and the pulses are merged. Finally a mean value for each time unit gives the final value. The error was not interesting for this analysis and was therefore left out.

Figure 7: A reconstructed pulse for whole energy region.

#### 2.2.2 Calculated time fit

The time from the highest sample to the top of the reconstructed pulse, as shown in figure 9, is called the calculated time. In the data used, the clock40des2 clock and the system clock were set to same phase. If clock40des2 is set to be in phase with the system-clock the calculated time is a measurement of the phase of the pulse peak with respect to the TTC-clock. In the TFit algorithm the samples are fitted to a known pulse shape and the calculated time is evaluated by a minimization of the \(\chi^{2}\). The distribution is shown to the left in figure 10. The shape can be understood as a convolution of the S3 trigger(, see section 2.5,) distribution relative to the true beam trigger and the uniform distribution of the random phase of the TTC-clock relative to the beam.

#### 2.2.3 The Resolution of the Calculated time fit

The resolution of the calculated time was measured with a Monte Carlo method. A physics pulse shown in figure 11 was restored from July 2002 data. In the Monte Carlo this pulse was sampled and a Gaussian error was added with RMS of 1.2 counts for high gain and 0.7 for low gain. The new samples were fitted by the TFit algorithm. The difference between the true Monte Carlo time and the calculated time is plotted in figure 12 and has an RMS of 0.03 ns.

Figure 12: Histogram of the calculated time resolution. A reconstructed high gain pulse from July 2002 data is sampled and fitted with the calculated time algorithm. The resolution is given by the difference of calculated time and the Monte Carlo time.

### Time between the master trigger and pulse maximum

Figure 10 shows the distribution of the calculated time. The TDC\({}_{TTC}\) measures the phase between the master trigger and the TTC-clock. The calculated time is the time between the TTC-clock and the pulse maximum. The TDC\({}_{TTC}\) and the calculated time are both related to the TTC-clock. They should therefore be related as a line with the absolute value of the slope equal to 1. Due to the calculated time algorithm the slope is -1. In July 2002 data there are four bands, see figure 13. These arise from the TDC\({}_{TTC}\) window size. In the 2003 July data the TDC\({}_{TTC}\) window was changed. The shape shown in figure 14 is strange. The data between 453 and 461 ns has slope of -1 and is used. Many events are cut away (see figure 5) but the result should not be biased since the slope of -1 indicates that the data is good.

### Drawer Timing for July 2002 data

Since the slopes in figures 13 and 14 are -1 the time between the master trigger and the reconstructed time is computed from the sum of the calculated time and TDC\({}_{TTC}\). In figure 15 the 2002 July data has four peaks related to the four bands in figure 13. The four peaks are separated by the expected 25 ns and the widths are the same so they are therefore merged together to achieve the highest possible statistics. A Gaussian is fitted to the peak shown in figure 16. The peak of the fit is the estimate of the time between the master trigger and the top of the reconstructed pulse. This value is used as the relative time for the specific drawer channel. To determine the relative timing for the whole module, this procedure is repeated for all channels (in which there is a signal).

Figure 13: Calculated time versus TDC\({}_{TTC}\) for 2002 July data. The TDC\({}_{TTC}\) distribution reaches from 1620 to 1705 where the TTC clock starts over 3 times (the width of the TDC\({}_{TTC}\) distribution divided by 25 ns) resulting in four bands.

Figure 14: Calculated time versus \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) for 2003 July data. Just one band is obtained. The part between 453 and 460 ns has the slope of -1 and is usable.

Figure 15: The sum of calculated time and \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) from July 2002 data. The Four peaks are due to the \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) window. The peaks have the same width.

The \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) is measured in the same way for all \(\eta\) and is used as the reference for the relative timing.

### Time between the beam counter and the master trigger

The tail to the left in figure 16 is not correlated with any physics variable so the master trigger was suspected to give rise to it. \(\mathrm{TDC}_{S3}\) measures the time difference between the S3-trigger and the master trigger, see figure 3. The distribution of \(\mathrm{TDC}_{S3}\) shown in figure 17 has a similar tail on the left. The master trigger is a coincidence of the S1-,S2- and S3-trigger and where the S3 beam-counter is the most precise. The \(\mathrm{TDC}_{S3}\) is therefore a good measurement of time difference between the master trigger and an arriving particle. The skewness of the trigger timing distribution can be explained by electronic noise causing the leading edge triggers to trigger early.

### Drawer timing for July 2003 data

As for the July 2002 data the \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) value and the calculated time are summed with the \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) and calculated time as described in previous sections. The distribution shown in figure 18 has the same tail as \(\mathrm{TDC}_{S3}\). The difference of the \(\mathrm{TDC}_{S3}\) and the sum of \(\mathrm{TDC}_{TTC}\) and calculated time is the time between the S3 trigger and the pulse maximum. This distribution is more Gaussian shaped than the unreduced distribution and the fit is better. See figure 19. The peak is used as a value of the relative time. The procedure is repeated for all module channels with good signal.

### July 2003 25-ns data

In 2003 data was taken with a 25-ns beam. The beam was synchronized with the TTC clock. To solve the timing for 25-ns data is therefore trivial since the calculated time gives the relative time directly. The clock40des2 clock was tuned during the run and data has to be corrected for this. The clock40des2 clock is shifted in steps of 0.10417 ns. Figure 20 shows the difference of calculated time and clock40des2 clock. The two peaks arise from a phase shift of the clock40des2 clock and the digitizer system clock. A better view of this is figure 21. To merge the two peaks the right one is moved by 25 ns to the left. A Gaussian is fitted to the final distribution. And again the mean value is used as the estimate of the relative time.

## 3 Result

The relative timing for all channels is put together in a graph (figure 22-25). Each point represents a channel number. The x-axis shows channel number and the y-axis shows relative time of arrival for the signal. The result is more or less what we expect. The points are grouped together in groups of six. Each group represents channels from a digitizer board, as channels from one board are sampled with the same clock. Relative timing for groups one to four increase approximately as expected as the TTC signal propagates in the drawer. Groups five to eight have the reversed behaviour since the TTC signal propagates in the opposite direction. The spread within a group mainly depends on the cell size, cell location and fiber length from the cell to the drawer, see figure 2. One can observe the high- and low-gain difference. Figure 26 shows the difference in high- and

low-gain for 2003 25 ns data. The mean value is 1.7 ns with an RMS of 0.3 ns.

### Error estimation

The Error of each point in figure 22 to 25 is the error of the mean value. The mean values are calculated using several thousands of data points and therefore the errors will vanish in the figures. The quality of a point is estimated from the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit. \(\chi^{2}\) of the Gaussian fit for 2003 25-ns and 2003 July TDC\({}_{S3}\) reduced data is much better than for the other two.

### Method Comparison

To be able to compare the methods the bias of the relative timing has to be removed. This is done by minimizing the difference of the relative times for the common channels of each low gain data set in figures 22, 23 and 24 to the 2003 25-ns data in figure 25. Figure 27 shows common low gain channels for all data sets with the bias removed. The errors are not included in the minimization since the number of events varies with more than a factor two in the different data sets. In figure 28 the timing difference of a given method and the 25-ns data is put in a histogram. The RMS of each of these distributions is about 1 ns. Figure 29 shows a histogram of the timing difference of July 2003 data with and without TDC\({}_{S3}\) reduction. The mean value is 0.15 and the RMS is 0.61. Nothing from figure 29 and 28 plot 2 and 3 indicates that one method is better than the others.

### clock40des2 Settings

In table 1 the relative timing values for high- and low-gain are listed. Channel 14,15,40 and 43 covering two \(\eta\)-values each, see figure 2. In these cases the mean values are listed. The clock40des2 values are calculated from the average between the max and min values of the relative times for each board divided by 0.10417 and then rounded to nearest integer. The values are not weighted since the statistics for the different channels is widely varying. The clock40des2 values for this analysis are listed in table 2. The bias for each data set has been removed. To be able to compare the settings for low and high gain the removed bias is the same for both gains.

The clock40des2 values in table 2 are in terms of K-value described in the TTCrx reference manual. The K-values run from 0 to 239 and are monotonically increasing.

Since the Tile-DMU internally uses the normal TTC-clock there can be setup and hold problems for some clock40des2 settings. To avoid that problem one can invert the in-clock[13] for the Tile-DMU. This can give rise to clock shift of one clock cycle and the pipeline memory depth has to be increased by one. The in-clock settings and pipeline offset is tabulated in table 3.

### Conclusions

Figure 30 shows a histogram of the timing for the 2003 low gain 25-ns data. The relative timing values for each board has been subtracted with the clock40des2 values listed in table 2. The worst channels will have a sample about 1.5 ns from the pulse peak. The requirement of a sample within 3 ns from the pulse peak is fulfilled. The rms of the data in the histogram in figure 30 is 0.8 ns.
