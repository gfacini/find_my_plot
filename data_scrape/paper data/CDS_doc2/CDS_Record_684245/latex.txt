A.S. Cerqueira, J.M. Seixas and A. Henriques

###### Abstract

This note describ es the two types of cables used by the trigger summing board, located on the Tilecal's drawer, the delay cables used to connect the 3-in-1 card to the trigger board's inputs, and the output cables to send the trigger board's output signals to the drawer's patch panel. This boards aim to build the trigger tower signals for Tilecal detector.The procedure used to compute the cable lengths of the delay cables is described and the results are presented. The technical specifications of the cables and connectors used are also described.

## 1 Introduction

The Tilecal trigger tower signals are built by analog adders (the trigger summing boards) which collect the PMT signal from the 3-in-1 card (trigger output). To connect the 3-in-1 output to the adder board input and to transmit the Adder output signals to the level 1 receiver 100 \(\Omega\) twisted pair cables are used.

A complete trigger tower signal is composed by two PMT signals from the first sampling layer (sampling A), two from the middle layer (sampling BC for barrel and sampling B for extended barrel) and one from the last layer (sampling D) (see fig. 1). Near the gap between the barrel and extended barrel there are incomplete towers. The tower structure as function of \(\eta\) is given in table 1.

Another signal generated by the trigger board is a buffer for the third layer signal of each trigger tower and is used by the muons trigger. On the barrel there are 10 calorimeter signals (trigger tower signals) and only 7 for the muon trigger and on the extended barrel there are 7 calorimeter signals and 5 for the muon trigger.

Due to requests of level 1 trigger system 1 the trigger tower configuration was changed to reduce the number of signals to be delivered to the level 1 without loosing performance on the trigger system. The proposed configuration can be seen in table 2.

Footnote 1: they use the information of 0.2x0.2 resolution and the level 1 receiver is capable to accept the maximum of 16 signals from 0.0\(\eta\)!1.6

The cables are done in such way that will be possible to cabling 9 or 10 boards on the barrel and 6 or 7 boards on the extended barrel, giving the opportunity

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

to change the configuration on the future. The modules will be instrumented with 10 adders on the barrel and 7 adders on the extended barrel but the cables will be connected to 9 adders on the barrel and 6 on the extended barrel.

The delay cables are described in Section 2 and the cables that send the adder output signals to the drawer patch panel are described in Section 3.

Delay Cables

To connect the 3-in-1 (PMT signal) output to the adder inputs we need to use cables of different lengths to adjust in time each PMT signal of the same trigger tower within 1.5 ns. The time required from the collision point to the signal arrival on the 3-in-1 output should be computed for each PMT, and then, the cable lengths should be computed to compensate the time differences between the PMTs of the same trigger tower.

### Time Required to the Response of Each PMT

The formulas listed bellow were taken from R. Leitner note about trigger cell timing and LVL1 issues [1].

* Consider t=0 the interaction point in ATLAS
* Particles reach calorimeter and shower develops with light speed c=30 cm/ns
* The cell with coordinates \((R_{\it cell},Z_{\it cell})\) is hit by particles in time \[t1=\frac{\sqrt{R_{\it cell}^{2}+Z_{\it cell}^{2}}}{c}\] (1)
* The decay time of polystyrene based scintillator is about \[t2=1.5ns\] (2)
* The transmission of blue light to WLS fibers takes time: \[t3=\frac{1}{2}R_{\it cell}\frac{2\pi}{64}\frac{n_{\it ref}}{<cos(\theta)>c}\] (3) where \(n_{\it ref}=1.59\) is the refraction index of the polystyrene and \[<cos(\theta)>=\frac{1}{2}(1+1/n_{\it ref})\] (4) is an effective cosine of emitted light angle
* The decay time in WLS fibers is [2] \[t4=5.7ns\] (5)
* The transmission time in WLS fibers to PMT \[t5=(L_{\it fiber}(\it cell))\frac{n_{\it ref}}{<cos\phi>c}\] (6) where \(L_{\it fiber}(\it cell)\) are corresponding fibers length, and \[<cos\phi>=\frac{1}{2}(1+n_{\it clad}/n_{\it ref})\] (7) with refraction index of the second cladding: \(n_{\it clad}=1.43\)* The collection time of R5900 PMT's has been measured [2] \[t6=9ns\] (8)
* The time delay in shaper circuit in 3-in-1 cards is [2] \[t7=70ns\] (9)
* Finally, the signals arrive to the shaper output in time: \[tt=t1+t2+t3+t4+t5+t6+t7\] (10)

#### 2.1.1 Tilecal Geometry

The trigger tower geometry can be seen on fig. 1.

**For the barrel:**

* The inner radius is 228 cm.
* There are three tiles (1, 2 and 3) in the first layer (A), three (4, 5 and 6) on second layer (B), three (7, 8 and 9) on the third layer (C), and two (10 and 11)on the last layer (D).
* The B and C layers are grouped together, resulting into the BC sampling layer
* In the radial direction, each tile has 9.7 cm in layer A, 12.7 cm in layer B, 14.7 cm in layer C and 18.7 in layer D.
* The Z coordinate is calculated on the middle of the eta tower, e.g. eta=0.05 for the first tower, 0.15 for the second tower, etc.

**For the Extended Barrel:**

* We have three tiles (1, 2 and 3) in the first layer (A), four (4, 5, 6 and 7) on second layer (B) and four (8, 9, 10 and 11) on the last layer (D).
* The cell C10 has three tiles (7, 8, and 9) and the cell D4 has two tiles (10 and 11).
* The tiles size are the same of the barrel.
* The Z coordinate is calculated on the middle of the eta tower.

The signal of each PMT is composed by a group of aluminized fibers connected to different tile sizes, consequently the fibers lengths change inside a cell as seen in fig. 2 for the barrel and fig. 3 for the extended barrel. The difference in length inside a cell can go up to 65 cm on the BC sampling layer, consequently in the same cell (PMT), we have different arriving times.

Figure 2: The barrel geometry with the fibers sizes and quantities for each cell. [2]

Figure 3: The extended barrel geometry and the fibers sizes for the odd PMTs in negative \(\eta\). [2]

#### 2.1.2 Results

In order to calculate the time for the signals to arrive in the Adder Board the following assumption was done:

* If we want to align the PMT signals by the signal starting point, we should choose the 'tile layer' which has the fastest response for each cell. For example: In the cell A1 we have three layers of tiles (1, 2 and 3); we should compute the time required for each layer and take the fastest one.

The results obtained for the cable length in order to adjust in time the arrival of the signal in the different cells are show in table 3 for the barrel and 4 for the extended barrel, and for comparison the results obtained by J. Pilcher [3] and R. Leitner [4] are given.

From the point of view of the cable assembly and manipulation it's more practical to have a smaller number of cables of different lengths. To achieve this goal we can ignore differences smaller then 0.4 ns (10 cm) on the cables.

The cable lengths for the barrel and extended barrel can be seen in table 5. A summary of the cables lengths for the barrel and for the extended barrel can be seen in table 6 and 7.

#### 2.1.3 Crack and Gap Scintillators

On the extended barrel there are four scintillators, which don't take part of the trigger towers, located on the gap between the barrel and the extended barrel. In figure 1 these scintillators are E1, E2, E3 and E4.

To perform on-line measurements of these signals they will be transmitted from the detector to the receiver by means of cables. The analog signals will be transmitted through 60 meters of cable and the quality of the received signal will be very pour. To increase the signal amplitude and consequently increase the signal noise ratio after the 60 meter of cable, was decided to use one adder board that increases 8 times the amplitude of the signal to be sent from the detector.

On the adder board the sum of the 4 signals will be available in one output and one of the 4 signals will be available on the other output. The signals should be aligned as they were for the trigger towers and using the same procedure the cable lengths were found and can be seen on table 8

### Cable Assembly and Specifications

A drawing and photo of a single delay cable used during the July 2000 test-beam can be seen in fig. 4 and 5.

Special arrangements of the cables of each trigger tower should be made to facilitate the cable connection on the Trigger Board and avoid errors during the drawer assembly. The idea is to group the cables of the same trigger tower in one bundle taking in account the different positions of each PMT and the

position of the connectors on the Trigger Board (see fig. 6). An example can be seen in fig. 7.

The cable lengths in table 5 were chosen considering the \(\mathfrak{D}\) cm gap between the inner and the outer drawers left for the drawer assembly, and the PMT positions related to the Trigger Boards, e.g., the delay cables are long enough to connect the PMT signals to each Trigger Board.

The quantity of cable needed for 130 barrel super-drawers and 130 super-drawers for the extended barrel plus 4 % spares is around 10 Km.

## 3 Adder Output Cables

In this section the cables to send the Trigger Summing Board output signal to the drawer patch panel are described.

On the barrel super-drawer there are 10 adders and on the extended barrel there are 7. From the 10 adders on the barrel, we have 10 calorimeter trigger signals and 7 muon trigger signals. From the 7 on the ext. barrel, 7 signals are calorimeter trigger signals and 5 are muon trigger signals. It gives a total of 17 signals for the barrel and 12 for the extended barrel.

The adder output cables should have a small attenuation to avoid problems with the SNR2 of the trigger tower signals and the cable impedance is 100 \(\Omega\).

Footnote 2: Signal Noise Ratio

On the drawer patch panel two cables (length \(\sim 70\) m) will transmit the calorimeter trigger signals to the LVL1 receiver and the muon signals to the muon trigger receiver. These cables should have 100 \(\Omega\) impedance to avoid signal reflections and should be capable to transmit the trigger signals with minimum distortion (a very good frequency response and very small signal attenuation).

The trigger boards are placed along the drawer (see table 1), consequently the cables should have different lengths. Measuring the distance between the drawer patch panel and each trigger board output, the cables lengths were defined.

A scheme of the Adder output cables for the barrel can be seen in fig. 8 and in fig. 9 for the Extended Barrel. On the scheme we can see that the cables are bundled together providing an easy way to connect the cables on the Adder outputs.

In fig. 10 we can see a photography of the cable used during July 2000 testbeam to send the signals from the inner drawer of the barrel to the drawer patch panel. In fig. 11 the photography of the other part of the cable with the connectors for each trigger board is shown.

Adding the cable lengths for each trigger tower, the quantity of cable needed to instrument 130 super-drawers of the barrel and 130 super-drawers of the extended barrel plus 4 % of spares is around 10 km.

#### Cable Specifications

One shielded twisted pair 100 \(\Omega\) with drain wire.

* Impedance: 100 \(\Omega\) +/- 15 %.
* Attenuation \(<9\) dB/100m (10 MHz).
* Wire size: 26 AWG (conductor OD \(\sim 0.5\) mm ).
* Cacitance nominal 42 pF/m.

Figure 10: Photography of the Adder output cable used during July 200 test-beam. This cable connect the Adder output signals from the inner drawer to the patch panel.

#### Connectors

Three connectors are used on the Adder output cables:

* The Berg [5] connector 78 211-003 (**quantity \(\sim\) 4 000**) with contacts 47565-00 2 (**quantity \(\sim\) 12 000**) to connect with the Adder's output connector.
* The Cannon 2D connector 2D-52 S-FO (female **quantity \(\sim\) 300**), 2D-52 P-FO (male **quantity \(\sim\) 300**), with female contact 030-9 542-00 1 (**quantity \(\sim\) 12 000**) and male contact 031-9 540-000 (**quantity \(\sim\) 12 000**), with plastic hood DB 51212-1 (**quantity \(\sim\) 600**) and locking system.
* The Sub-D connector DC37S064T (**quantity \(\sim\) 540**) with the metal hood DCJ S196 78-3 (**quantity \(\sim\) 540**) on the patch panel. On the drawer patch panel there are 2 Sub-D connectors, one is used for the calorimeter trigger signals and other for the muon signals.

The connectors for the Adder output cables are summarized in table 10.

Figure 11: Photography of the Adder output cable used during July 2000 test-beam. This cable connect the trigger board outputs to the cable seen in fig. 10.

## 4 Conclusions

In this note the delay cables and the output cables for the trigger summing board were described.

The delay cables lengths were computed and the definitive lengths were presented. The calculations done were compared with the results obtained by different sources, with independent methods. The number of cables with different lengths was reduced considering the cables with lengths smaller than 10 cm as cables of the same length.

The lengths and connectors of the Adder output cables were also defined, including the inter-drawer connector.

The delay cables that cross the two drawers will also make use of the inter-drawer connector of the Adder output cables. On the barrel 3 delay cables are connected and 4 delay cables on the extended barrel.

A solution to send the signal of the crack and gap scintillators using the extra adder board on the extended barrel was described. The use of the adder board increases the signal amplitude and improves the quality of the signal received after the 60 meters of cable.
