Introduction

Because of the increasing amount of material in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter [1], a degradation of its resolution is expected with increasing rapidity. At high \(\eta\) values, both the bremsstrahlung losses in the inner detectors and the probability that the electromagnetic shower starts in the material of the coil or the cryostat increase. In such a case, the energy deposition in the electromagnetic calorimeter is smaller than expected because part of the energy is lost in the material in front of it. In addition, the energy reconstructed in the first two layers of the calorimeter, the preshower [2], should be larger than expected.

As an example, the correlation between the preshower energy and the electromagnetic calorimeter energy is shown in figure 1 for 100 GeV electrons at \(\eta=0.1\). This correlation can be used to correct the electromagnetic calorimeter energy with the preshower energy in order to recover the optimal energy resolution.

In this note a calibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter using the preshower information is presented. The procedure used is described in Section 2, the results in Section 3 and finally the conclusions and summary in Section 4.

## 2 Procedu

The calorimeter geometry simulation has been implemented in the SLUG/GEANT framework. Single electron events at 20, 50 and 100 GeV with rapidity values ranging from 0:1 to 2.8 have been generated and processed through the full DICE [3] simulation (version B).

The preshower energy and the electromagnetic calorimeter energy have been combined using the following general expression to improve the resolution at large rapidity values.

\[E=A\,\left(E^{ELEC.CAL.}+B\,E^{PRESH.}\right) \tag{1}\]

The parameter \(.4\) has been chosen to be constant where \(B\) has been allowed to vary as a function of both the energy and the rapidity ones:

As shown in figure 2 the study has been divided into

* \(\eta\,\epsilon\,(0,0.8)\): Central barrel.
* \(\eta\,\epsilon\,(0.8,1.38)\): Extreme barrel.
* \(\eta\,\epsilon\,(1.38,1.42)\): Crack region.
* \(\eta\,\epsilon\,(1.42,1.6)\): Zone in front of the cryostat corner.
* \(\eta\,\epsilon\,(1.6,2.5)\): Endcap with preshower.
* \(\eta\,\epsilon\,(2.5,3.)\): Endcap without preshower.

The reason for this division can be seen in figure 3 where the variation of the energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter as a function of rapidity is shown for 20, 50 and 100 GeV electrons (the quoted energies are uncalibrated, i.e., as obtained from GEANT).

Two discontinuities are seen. The first one, at \(\eta=0.8\), corresponds to a decrease in the amount of lead in the electrodes designed to keep the variation of the effective absorber thickness with \(\eta\) at an acceptable level. The second one, at \(\eta=1.4\), corresponds to the barrel-endcap crack. In figure 4 the energy deposition in the preshower as a function of \(\eta\) for 20, 50 and 100 GeV electrons is shown.

Results

### Central barrel

The following expression for the total energy in terms of the electromagnetic calorimeter and the preshower energies (denoted \(E^{ECAL}\) and \(E^{PS}\) respectively) is assumed

\[E=.4\left[E^{ECAL}+\left(B_{0}+B_{1}\cdot\eta^{2}\right)E^{PS}\right] \tag{2}\]

To determine \(A\), \(B_{0}\) and \(B_{1}\) the following quantity is minimized at each energy point (\(E_{0}\) is the nominal energy and \(K\) is a constant)

\[Q=\sum_{i}\left(E_{0}-E_{i}\right)^{2}+K\ \left(<E^{2}>-<E>^{2}\right) \tag{3}\]

The results of the minimization are shown in table 1

The average of the \(A\)'s and \(B_{0}\)'s at the different energies has been taken and the dependence of \(B_{1}\) with energy (figure 5) studied.

A square root parametrization has been then used (\(B_{1}=\sqrt{B_{10}+B_{11}E}\)) leading to the expression

\[E=6.256\ \left[E^{ECAL}+\left(1.529+\sqrt{0.092+0.00283\ E}\ \eta^{2}\right)\ E^{PS}\right] \tag{4}\]

and finally substituting \(E=6.256\ E^{ECAL}\) the following expression for the energy in the \(\eta\ \epsilon\left(0,0.8\right)\) interval is obtained

\[E=6.256\ \left[E^{ECAL}+\left(1.529+\sqrt{0.092+0.0177\ E^{ECAL}}\ \eta^{2}\right)\ E^{PS}\right] \tag{5}\]

### Extreme barrel

In this region an expression which uses the total energy in the preshower (like the one used for the central part of the barrel) is not good enough to reach the desired resolutions. So the correction has been split into two terms using the energy deposited in each layer of the preshower. The parametrization assumed is the following

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(E(GeV)\) & \(A\) & \(B_{0}\) & \(\bar{B_{1}}\) \\ \hline
20 & 6.284 & 1.532 & 0.366 \\
50 & 6.253 & 1.512 & 0.515 \\
100 & 6.230 & 1.542 & 0.598 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Values of \(.4\), \(B_{0}\) and \(B_{1}\) for 20, 50 and 100 GeV electrons.

\[E=A\left[E^{ECAL}+\left(B_{0}+B_{1}\eta\right)E^{PS1}+\left(C_{0}+C_{1}\eta \right)E^{PS2}\right] \tag{6}\]

Minimizing equation 3 and assuming a linear dependence of the parameters on the energy the following expression is obtained for this region

\[E = 5.618\left\{E^{ECAL}\right. \tag{7}\] \[+ \left.\left[1.763+0.019E^{ECAL}+\left(0.481-0.038E^{ECAL}\right) \eta\right]E^{PS1}\right.\] \[+ \left.\left[1.314-0.045E^{ECAL}+\left(0.139+0.056E^{ECAL}\right) \eta\right]E^{PS2}\right\}\]

### Crack region

In this region the information of the electromagnetic and preshower calorimeters from both barrel and endcap parts has to be combined.

Using the same techniques described above one arrives at the following expression

Figure 5: \(B_{1}\) parameter dependence on the energy.

\[E = 5.610\] \[\left[E^{ECAL}+\sqrt{3.95+0.5E^{ECAL}}\;E^{PS}\right]\;+\] \[.\] \[. \tag{8}\]

where \(E^{ECAL}\) and \(E^{PS}\) are the energies deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter and preshower corresponding to the barrel and \(E^{ENDE}\) and \(E^{PSE}\) are the same for the endcap part.

### Zone in front of the cryostat corner

The resolution in this zone will be worse than expected due to the large amount of material (corner of the coil and cryostat) in front of it.

The energy in this zone can be expressed as

\[E = 5.90\left\{E^{ENDE}\right. \tag{9}\] \[+ \left[-16.50-0.265E+\left(14.04+0.172E\right)\eta\right]E^{PSE1}\] \[+ \left[34.23-0.146E-\left(20.59+0.103E\right)\eta\right]E^{PSE2}\}\]

where \(E=9.5E^{ENDE}\).

### Endcap with preshower

The same energy and eta dependence as for the extreme barrel is assumed for this zone. The minimization leads to the following expression

\[E = 6.073\left\{E^{ENDE}\right. \tag{10}\] \[+ \left[5.818+0.028E^{ENDE}+\left(-1.609-0.017E^{ENDE}\right)\eta \right]E^{PSE1}\] \[+ \left[1.014-0.019E^{ENDE}+\left(0.315+0.005E^{ENDE}\right)\eta \right]E^{PSE2}\}\]

### Endcap without preshower

In this zone there is no preshower in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter so the only thing to be determined is a global factor

\[E=6.11\;E^{ENDE} \tag{11}\]Results and Summary

With the expressions derived in each region the incident energy can be reconstructed in the whole electromagnetic calorimeter \(\eta\) range. The resolution as a function of the rapidity for 20, 50 and 100 GeV electrons is shown in figure 6. Excepting the crack region and the zone in front of the cryostat corner (1.3 \(<\eta<\) 1.6) the resolution is better than 11%.

The ratio between the mean value of the reconstructed energy and the nominal energy as a function of the rapidity for 20, 50 and 100 GeV electrons can be seen in figure 7. This ratio differs from unity in less than 2% in the whole \(\eta\) region (crack and cryostat corner excepted).

Finally, \(\sigma/E\) is plotted versus \(1/\sqrt{E}\) for electrons at \(\eta=0.4\) (figure 8). The data is described by a linear fit

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{A}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus B \tag{12}\]

with \(A=0.093\) and \(B=-0.3\cdot 10^{-3}\).

This calibration is available in the framework of the ATRECON package. To obtain calibrated energies the card "DETA 'ECAL' 8=1 has to be included in the datacard file.
