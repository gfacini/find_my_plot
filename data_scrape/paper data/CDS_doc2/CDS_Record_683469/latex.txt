From our point of view the second way of the supermodules assembly has the following advantages, namely :

1. It isn't required expensive facility of the large sizes for assembly operations.

2. The problems concerning the lifting and transport operations get essentially simplified.

3. In the short module the possible deformations provided by the welding joints are far less and can be easily compensated during the assembly of modules into supermodule.

4. The precise positioning of each half-period on Z-axis is provided in the limits of the supermodule and the whole barrel.

5. It's assured the reproducibility of the linear dimensions for each module and supermodule.

6. There is no problem of the joining and assembling for the end plates of barrel between each other (plates of 20 mm thickness), so one can organize the preliminary test assembly of the end "lids" of barrel.

In the proposed version of the supermodule there is the possibility of the insert the additional steel plate welded inside the slot organized on the inner radius (see Fig.3). The insertion of this plate allows to raise the linearity of supermodule and its stiffness.

Utilization possibility of thin steel strips welded by spot-veld was considered to improve mechanical protection of fibers and to ensure its firm fixation in tile recesses.

**4.0. Module. Design philosophy.**

Supermodule consists of 6 modules, each of them is formed from plates of half-periods welded to 20 mm thickness steel plate and fastened together with thread studs and strips Fig.

Assembly of 1m length individual module is carried out on jig. Assembled stuck of halfperiods is compressed with pressing device of the jig to stops which make the given dimension of a module in Z-direction. Outer plates of a module are pressed against movable and stationary plates of the jig for presence of elasticity forces in a module, i.e. geometry of a module in the jig conforms exactly to the given geometry. Studs are inserted into the holes in the compressed module and are drawn up with nuts (Fig._4-_3_).

Support plate of 20mm thickness is welded to the top part of the module. If assembly of module is completed at this stage and compressing forces are removed free edges of the plates which are clamped up on center with studs fold and module length changes by 2\(\Delta\) (Fig. \(4\)2_).

To exclude this effect and to reduce load to studs it is suggested to add strips into spacers overlap zones from two sides of the module.

During assembly when module is in compressed state strips are pressed into engagement with recesses, tightened and welded (Fig._4-_4_). Then ends are cut. Recasses are made in the parts (FigUsing the method of module forming we can produce necessary geometry of the module.

Proposed construction of modules allows to insure replication of linear dimensions from module to module, transportation problems become simpler.

Elements making base of modules construction are shown on Fig. 8-15

**5.0. Girder and carriage.**

It is suggested to examine new design of support girder and version of PMs placement on removable carriage.

Supermodule is assembled from individual modules which are fastened to two T-beams. In the zone of last spacers and tiles fibers are placed within girder, assembled as bunch and fastened to the plate (Fig. _[_]_ ). Then ends are cut and polished.

Guides are mounted on the plate on which carriage with PMs moves.

This design allows to produce contact of PM mixers with fibers accurate to \(\pm 0.05\)mm.

Suggested structure of the girder allows to make \(\varphi\) force closure between supermodules along lower and upper plates of girder (Fig _[_]_).

Structure of the carriage with self-aligning PMs is shown in Fig. _[_]_.

During transportation PMs are pressed out with stop. After insertion of the carriage into the module the stop is removed and PMs are pressed to fiber bunches with spring. Gapless optical contact is produced.
