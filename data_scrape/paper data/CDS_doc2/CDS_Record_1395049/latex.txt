The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note compiles all ATLAS results on the isolated prompt photon production at 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy. The data are compared to NLO pQCD calculations, obtained with the JETPHOX program using different sets of parton distribution functions (PDFs).

Introduction

The isolated prompt photon production cross section has been measured by ATLAS using all LHC \(pp\) data from 2010, at a center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV. A first measurement [1] used 0.88pb\({}^{-1}\) of data and covered the kinematic region \(15\GeV\leq E_{\mathrm{T}}<100\GeV\) in three different pseudorapidity bins \(|\eta|<0.6\), \(0.6\leq|\eta|<1.37\) and \(1.52\leq|\eta|<1.81\). The most recent measurement [2] explored a higher \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) regime \(45\GeV\leq E_{\mathrm{T}}<400\GeV\) and expanded the coverage to include the \(1.81\leq|\eta|<2.37\) region by using the full \(35\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\)of data from 2010 run.

In both analysis, the JETPHOX[3, 4] program was used to compute the NLO cross sections with different sets of Parton Density Functions (PDFs). A detailed explanation of the code, setting parameters and methods used to calculate the inclusive prompt photon cross section and its uncertainties is found in [5]. Both measurements used the CTEQ [6] PDF for the central value, with additional plots [7, 8] available for MSTW [9] (and in the latter measurement NNPDF [10] too). The only addition in this note are the theoretical predictions for the first measurement using the NNPDF set of parton distribution functions.

## 2 Results

The prompt photon production cross sections are shown in Fig. 1 compared to the theoretical predicition when using the CTEQ6.6 set of PDFs. The four \(\eta\) bins are included, scaled by an arbitrary factor for the sake of clarity. The same is shown in Fig. 2 for MSTW2008 and in Fig. 3 for NNPDF 2.0. A very good agreement can be observed, within uncertainties, between the two measurements in the overlapping region. In turn, the NLO pQCD predictions agree in all cases with the observed cross sections for transverse energies \(>25\GeV\), while for transverse energies \(<25\GeV\) the cross sections predicted by JETPHOX are higher than measured as discussed in [1].

In Figures 4 and 5, the results are re-arranged per pseudorapidity region, with the aim of comparing the NLO predictions obtained by using different sets of PDFs and their agreement to data. The predictions for CTEQ6.6, MSTW08 and NNPDF2.0 are shown, together with the two ATLAS measurements. In the bottom panels, the theory/data ratio is shown for each PDF set. As discussed in [5], the central values obtained with the MSTW 2008 (NNPDF2.0) PDFs are 3 to 5% (1 to 4%) higher than those predicted using the CTEQ 6.6 PDFs. The theoretical uncertainty is dominated by the scale uncertainty (10%), which presently limits the discrimination between PDFs. For this same reason it is not included in Fig. 4 and 5, where only the statistical, PDF and isolation (2%) uncertainties on the theoretical prediction are considered (summed in quadrature).

Future measurements of the inclusive isolated photon production in finer pseudorapidity binning and those of the photon + jet system are expected to give a more sensitive input to constrain the PDFs.
