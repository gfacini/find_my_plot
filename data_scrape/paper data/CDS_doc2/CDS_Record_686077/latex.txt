###### Abstract

The algorithm and basic assumptions used to evaluate the muon momentum resolution in the 8-coil air-core toroid are described in detail. We then investigate the rapidity and \(p_{\perp}\) dependence of the resolution in a typical material-free region, as well as the azimuthal dependence of the resolution, near the coil plane, in the central region. The paper closes with a brief reminder of previously undocumented studies on the impact, on the resolution, of the number of coils and of the magnet length.

## 1 Introduction

This note describes the method used to calculate the resolution on the muon momentum measurements summarized in the Technical Proposal. The algorithm is described in section 2. The magnetic field used in the program is presented in section 3, the chamber layout in section 4 and the material distribution in section 5. Energy loss fluctuations are discussed in section 6. The performance assumed for the muon chambers and its impact on the muon momentum measurement are presented in section 7.

Finally the results on the ATLAS muon spectrometer resolution are discussed in section 8.

## 2 Description of the method

The muon spectrometer is modelled by a set of planes (Fig. 1) which represent either measurement planes (one plane corresponds to one MDT multilayer [1]) or simplified materialdistributions. A muon generated with a given \(p_{1}^{2}\), azimuth \(\phi\) and pseudorapidity \(\eta\) is tracked in the magnetic field without taking into account at this stage multiple scattering in the material planes. This gives a set of reference coordinates \((z(p),r\phi(p)\) in the barrel and \(r(p),r\phi(p)\) in the end caps) corresponding to hits in muon chambers.

Then the program fits (using MINUIT) a total of \(5+2\times N\) parameters (where \(N\) is the number of material planes) :

* 5 parameters which describe the particle trajectory (the momentum \(p\) and the initial direction and position (\(X_{1}\) to \(X_{4}\)) of the muon on a reference plane upstream of the toroid)
* two angles \((\theta_{j}^{1},\ \theta_{j}^{2})\) for each material plane \(j\). In the fit each scattering angle follows a normal distribution of width \(\sigma_{j}\) given by \(\frac{13.6\ \mbox{MeV}}{\beta cp}\sqrt{\frac{x_{j}}{X_{6}}}(1+0.038\ln\frac{x_{j}}{X_{ 6}})\)[2] where \(x_{j}\) is the radiative thickness, in radiation lengths, encountered by the muon when traversing plane number \(j\).

At each step of the minimization procedure, muons are generated with initial momentum and coordinates, \(p+\delta p\), \(X_{l}^{\prime}=X_{l}+\delta X_{l}\), and tracked assuming non zero values of the scattering angles \(\theta_{j}^{1,2}\). This leads to a set of coordinates \(z(p+\delta p,\ \theta_{j})\), \(r\phi(p+\delta p,\ \theta_{j})\) which can be combined with the reference coordinates \(z(p),\ r\phi(p)\), to calculate a \(\chi^{2}\) defined by :

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\left(z_{i}(p)-z_{i}(p+\delta p,\ \theta_{j}) \right)^{2}}{\sigma_{x_{i}}^{2}} + \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\left(r\phi_{i}(p)-r\phi_{i}(p+\delta p,\ \theta_{j}) \right)^{2}}{\sigma_{r\phi_{i}}^{2}} +\] \[\sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{(\theta_{j}^{1})^{2}}{\sigma_{j}^{2}} + \sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{(\theta_{j}^{2})^{2}}{\sigma_{j}^{2}}\]

where :

* \(n\) is the number of measurements (equal to the number of multilayer),
* \(z_{i}(p),\ r\phi_{i}(p)\) are the hits position in the \(i^{\rm th}\) plane for a muon of true momentum \(p\) of the muon (without multiple scattering),
* \(z_{i}(p+\delta p,\ \theta_{j}),\ r\phi_{i}(p+\delta p,\ \theta_{j})\) are the measured coordinates in the \(i^{\rm th}\) plane for a muon momentum \(p+\delta p\) and including multiple scattering,
* \(\sigma_{x_{i}},\sigma_{r\phi_{i}}\) are the errors on the coordinate measurement in the \(i^{\rm th}\) plane (see Sec. 7) 1. Footnote 1: \(\sigma_{x_{i}}\) receives a contribution coming from the error on the drift distance between the wire and the track. So \(\sigma_{x_{i}}\) can be a function of \(z_{i}\).

The minimization procedure outputs two MINOS-based errors, \(\Delta^{+}p\) and \(\Delta^{-}p\), that correspond to \(\chi^{2}\rightarrow\chi^{2}+1\) for \(p\to p+\Delta^{+}p\) and \(p\to p-\Delta^{-}p\). In general, \(\Delta^{+}p\) and \(\Delta^{-}p\) are unequal because the problem is non-linear (due to the field). We define the final error as : \(\Delta p\ =\ \left(\Delta^{+}p+\Delta^{-}p\right)/2\).

As the final result does not depend on the multiple scattering angle assumed for the reference track, it is simpler to generate the latter ignoring multiple scattering altogether.

This program has not the structure of a MC program. Indeed, the estimate of the muon momentum at a given \(p,\ \phi\) and \(\eta\) is not determined by sending a large number of muons in a detailed detector simulation program. This way to proceed would be CPU-time consuming and not well adapted to a phase of muon detector layout optimization.

## 3 Magnetic field

All results, except those given in Appendix B, were obtained using a 3-D magnetic field calculation: this is essential for proper treatment of the barrel to end-cap transition region (\(1.1<\eta<1.8\)). The magnetic field \(B(r,\phi)\) is calculated as the sum of contributions from individual magnet conductors; these are treated as thread-like and consisting of a finite number of consecutive straight segments. Magnetic material (Tile calorimeter, solenoid return yoke, forward iron shield) are not taken into account.

The layout used in evaluating the field in this study is shown in Fig. 2, and the main parameters summarized in Table 1 (they do not correspond exactly to the final TP numbers at the cm level and the inner bore of the End-Cap Toroid is still assumed to be conical, rather than cylindrical).

Typical field maps in the mid-plane of the barrel and end-cap toroids (assuming Staging Document [3] dimensions and evaluated with a simplified 2-D code) are shown in Fig. 3. The field in the transition region exhibits a rather complex pattern, which has significant implications for the second coordinate requirements [4].

## 4 Chamber layout and field integral

Starting with the LoI's layout we converge to the present layout where the muon momentum measurements are based on :

* a sagitta measurement with 3 chambers parallel to the beam axis (barrel), for \(\eta\in[0,\ 1.1]\),
* a sagitta measurement with 3 vertical chambers (barrel and end-cap), \(\eta\in[1.1,\ \sim 1.4]\),
* a point-vector measurement (equivalent to a sagitta measurement) with 3 vertical chambers (end-cap) : one before the end-cap magnet (point measurement) and two after the deflection it provides (vector measurement), \(\eta\in[\sim 1.4,\ 2.8\ \text{or}\ 3.0]\).

Figure 1 shows the layout assumed in the present calculation. The corresponding parameters are listed in Table 2 (they may not correspond exactly to the TP numbers but possible differences would not significantly change the results).

### Effective field integral

In the case of the ATLAS toroids, a muon passing within a few degrees in azimuth of either the Barrel or End-Cap coil planes, experiences reverse field over part of its trajectory. The impact of this reverse bending will depend on where it occurs with respect to the muon measuring stations. A better benchmark of the bending power is therefore The bending power is therefore the effective field integral, defined as :\[\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left|\int_{i}^{i+1}B\mathrm{d}l\right|\]

where \(i\) and \(i+1\) indicate consecutive _multilayer_, and \(n\) is the total number of multilayer.

Fig. 4 (above) displays the effective field integral for infinite momentum muons and 5 GeV \(\mu^{+}\) (see Table 3). For given values of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) at the production point, the muon trajectory depends on its momentum ; the effective bending power is therefore different for an infinite momentum particle, and for, say, a 5 GeV \(\mu^{+}\).

It should be stressed that while the effective field integral is an indicator of the analyzing power of the magnet2, the only really relevant quantity, in the end, is the resolution itself, that takes into account full tracking in the varying magnetic field, as well as other instrumental effects (Sec.s. 5, 6, and 7).

### Muon trajectories in the transition region

In the transition region (\(\eta\in[1.1,\ 1.8]\)) the large variation of \(B\) with \(\phi\) induces important modification of the muon trajectories.

Figure 5 shows the deflection \(\delta\) of a muon at \(\eta=1.45,\ 1.5,\ 1.6,\ 1.65\) (in the end-cap region) and at \(p_{\rm L}=100\) GeV. The deflection is calculated with respect to a straight line joining the entry and the exit positions of the muon at the extremities of the end-cap toroid (so \(\delta_{\rm Entry}=\delta_{\rm Exit}=0\) at \(z_{\rm Entry}=700\) cm and \(z_{\rm Exit}=1300\) cm).

Due to the reverse field at the end of the barrel (\(\eta\sim\ 1.6,\ \phi\leq\ 3^{\circ}\)) the muon experiences a bending opposite to what one would naively expect. The regions where this phenomenon occurs are small (a few % of the overall acceptance). This effect is studied in more detail in Sec. 8.3.

\end{table}
Table 3: Integration limits used for \(\sum|J\,B\!d\,|\)Material distribution

The resolution, at low \(p_{\perp}\), is directly connected to the material distribution. The different sources of multiple scattering are :

* the muon chambers,
* the trigger chambers,
* the chamber support structures,
* the structure of the toroid (conductors, cryostat, voussoir, formers...).

### Material between barrel coils

Table 4 gives the material distribution assumed in the simulation (we neglect the air as it represents only \(\sim 2\%\) of \(X_{0}\)).

Figure 6 displays the radiative thickness of the voussoir (including their cryostat) and cross-braces as a function of \(\eta\). Hatch areas are from the engineering studies [5], horizontal lines are radiation length used in the simulation. As material are simulated by either a horizontal or a vertical plane, the numbers in Table 4 are lower than those shown on Fig. 6 and the program takes into account the angle of the muon track with respect to the material planes.

### Material associated with coils and cryostats

A barrel coil (including its cryostat) extends to an azimuthal angle of \(\sim 5^{\circ}\). In this azimuthal region, there are important variations of the material distribution coming from the shape of the cryostat and also the position of the conductors. Figure 7 shows the total amount of material traversed by a muon as a function of the azimuthal angle (\(\phi=0^{\circ}\) correspond to the plane of the barrel coil). The corresponding structural elements are shown in Fig. 8.

The main contributions (chambers included), are :

* at \(\phi=0^{\circ}\), from the plate of the coil,
* at \(\phi=1.5^{\circ}\), from the inner pancake of conductors,
* at \(\phi=2.1^{\circ}\), from the horizontal component of cryostat (inner and outer ones),
* at \(\phi=2.5^{\circ}\), from the vertical plate of the external cryostat,
* at \(\phi=3^{\circ}\), from the internal horizontal cryostat,
* at \(\phi=3.5^{\circ}\), like at \(\phi=2.5^{\circ}\) with only the inner cryostat.

To simulate thick blocks of material traversed by the muons (at \(\phi=2.5^{\circ}\) and \(r\sim 920\) cm for example), several material planes have to be used in order to take into account the thickness of the material and the correlation coefficient \(\rho_{y\theta}\) between the two scattering variables (\(y\) is the deflection at the end of the material plane and \(\theta\) is the deflection angle).

This coefficient is : \(\rho_{y\phi}=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-1/4n^{2}}}\) where \(n\) is the number of scattering planes. In practice 2 planes are enough as \(\rho_{y\phi}\sim\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}\) when \(n\geq 2\). The simplified model used with simulation is summarized in Table 5.

## 6 Energy loss fluctuation

At low momentum (typically below 30 GeV/c), the resolution is dominated by the fluctuations of the energy loss in the calorimeter and the return yoke. The difficulty is that this contribution to the error follows a highly non-gaussian distribution (Landau + tails) while one would like to reduce it to a gaussian term in order to fold it with the other gaussian measurement errors.

The energy loss of a muon in the inner detectors have been evaluated in a GEANT simulation of a 10 interaction length (\(\lambda_{\rm I}\)) thick calorimeter plus a \(2\lambda_{\rm I}\) thick iron return yoke (at \(\eta=0\)).

There exist various ways to estimate the equivalent gaussian width of the energy loss distribution, none of which is really satisfactory. The following ways have been looked at :

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Material traversed & Radiation length & Radial position \\  & (fraction of \(X_{0}\)) & (cm) \\ \hline Inner barrel chamber & 0.10 & 480 \\ Medium barrel chamber & 0.10 & 715 \\ Trigger chamber & 0.10 & 750 \\ Outer chamber & 0.10 & 1040 \\ External radial cryostat & 0.34 & 510 \\ First inner structure of the end-cap & 0.45 & 360 \\ Second inner structure of the end-cap & 0.45 & 140 \\ First voussoir & 2.45 & 561 \\ Second voussoir & 1.93 & 561 \\ Third voussoir & 1.71 & 561 \\ \hline  & & Z position \\  & & (cm) \\ \hline Chamber + inner side of the end-cap cryostat & 0.242 + 0.580 & 710 \\ Small sagitta chamber & 0.172 & 1040 \\ Chamber after the end-cap (\(\eta<1.7\)) & 0.242 & 1330 \\ Chamber + outer end-cap cryostat (\(\eta>1.7\)) & 0.242 + 0.650 & 1330 \\ Fourth voussoir & 2.05 & 842 \\ Fifth voussoir & 2.37 & 1082 \\ First cross-brace & 0.40 & 120 \\ Second cross-brace & 0.40 & 361 \\ Third cross-brace & 0.40 & 600 \\ Fourth cross-brace & 0.40 & 842 \\ Fifth cross-brace & 0.40 & 1082 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Radiative thickness for various components of the toroid and the muon detectors* A pessimistic view would consist in taking the RMS of the energy loss distribution truncated at some arbitrary upper value. The first line of Table 6 gives these values of the RMS for an upper cutoff of 25 GeV.
* Actually the calorimeter will eventually provide an estimate of the energy loss for isolated muons. In the LoI and the TP, we have considered that any catastrophic energy loss of more than 10 GeV, occurring within the last \(9\lambda_{\rm I}\), would be measured with some resolution ; we took \(30\%/\sqrt{E}\). This measured energy loss was then subtracted from the total energy loss (per muon) and the RMS of the distribution of this corrected energy loss was taken to be the equivalent gaussian sigma. It appears in the second line of Table 6 as RMS (TP).
* The third line shows the same quantities corresponding to a more optimistic cut off at 5 GeV.
* In fact we are interested in the core of the distribution rather than in the tails. In order to consider this core only, we have chosen to fit the distribution of the full energy loss with 2 half gaussian curves of different sigma but with identical peak values. Figure 9 shows this fit for momentum values of 20 and 50 GeV. The equivalent gaussian sigma is then taken to be the average of the sigma of the two gaussian. It is given in the fourth line of Table 6. Considering the full width at half maximum would lead to similar numbers. Although this choice is arbitrary, we have used these values to account for the energy loss contribution (this contribution is quadraticaly added to the others). For \(|\eta|<0.5\), a good parametrization of this equivalent gaussian RMS is given by : \[\sigma(E_{\rm loss})=0.26+0.51\times\frac{P\ ({\rm GeV})}{100}\quad{\rm GeV}\] This width is expected to vary slowly with the thickness traversed (roughly like the square root of the number of \(\lambda_{\rm I}\)).

## 7 Resolution of the muon chambers

Each chamber has a vector measurement capability given by two multilayer stations distant by \(\sim 30\) cm. Table 7 lists the two types of error assumed in the simulation for the measurement of the deflection.

The resolution on the second coordinate \(R\phi\) is given by the combination of two planes per chamber equipped with \(\sim 3.5\) cm wide strips which results in an effective resolution of \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\) cm per chamber.

We assume that the \(r\) position (resp. \(z\) position) is perfectly known for the barrel (resp. end-cap) chambers. Thus, to reconstruct the muon momentum in the barrel, one needs to project the error from the tubes (perpendicular to the muon track) on the \(z\)-axis. This induces a \(1/\sin(\theta)\) dependence for the error 3 On the other hand the number \(N\) of hit tubes varies like \(1/\sin(\theta)\) and the overall error for a multilayer like \(1/\sqrt{N}\sim\sqrt{\sin(\theta)}\). Therefore the sagitta error should vary as \(1/\sqrt{\sin(\theta)}\).

Footnote 3: We have the same dependence in the end-cap with a change from \(\theta\) to \(\pi-\theta\)

For the alignment error we assume that the error varies like \(1/\sin(\theta)\), which is equivalent to a constant error for each muon track for all pseudorapidities.

Finally the global error along the \(z\) axis, per multilayer, 4 is :

Footnote 4: We are pessimistic in the simulation since we assume an alignment error for each chamber. Actually the alignment error should concern only a triplet of chambers (a tower).

\[\delta_{\rm Multilayer}\approx\sqrt{\left(\frac{\sqrt{2}\ \sigma_{0}}{\sin( \theta)}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{\sigma_{\rm multilayer}}{\sqrt{\sin(\theta)}} \right)^{2}}\]

consistent with \(66\ \mu\)m at \(\eta\ =\ 0\) and \(105\ \mu\)m at \(\eta\ =\ 1\). For a chamber the error is \(\delta_{\rm Chamber}\sim\delta_{\rm Multilayer}/\sqrt{2}\sim 46\ \mu\)m at \(\eta=0\).

Finally, the different contributions to the error on the muon momentum measurement are (neglecting any pattern recognition error) :

## 8 Results

The following results are presented :

* resolution as a function of pseudorapidity at an average azimuth \(\phi=11.25^{\circ}\),
* variation of the resolution with the azimuth at \(\eta=0\),
* variation of the resolution with the length of the toroid system.

### Resolution as a function of pseudorapidity

Figure 10 shows the resolution (the azimuthal angle assume is \(\phi=11.25^{\circ}\)) corresponding to the layout of Fig. 1. The discontinuities in the resolution are caused by the voussoir and the cross-braces of the barrel toroid magnet.

At very high transverse momentum, \(p_{\perp}\geq 300\) GeV, the momentum resolution is dominated by the tube and alignment errors.

With decreasing transverse momentum (\(\sim 100\) GeV) the relative contribution of the multiple scattering increases and progressively dominates the resolution.

The energy loss becomes important at energies below 50 GeV and is comparable to the multiple scattering error for transverse momentum of 30 GeV or lower.

The bump around the \(\eta=1.3\) is due to the \(\int Bd\!l\) variation in the transition region, where the reverse field of the end-cap weakens the main deflection from the barrel.

### Resolution near a barrel coil plane (at \(\eta=0\))

In this study, we have assumed the geometry and the chamber performance given in Table 8 (resolution and layout of the Staging Document)

The muon momentum resolution for \(p_{\perp}=30\) and 300 GeV is displays in Fig. 11. The important conclusion from this study is that even in the coil region, where there is a lot of material, the global resolution is very close to the resolution with "material-free" region between coils. This is mainly due, at low \(p_{\perp}\), to the angle-angle resolution between multilayer (\(\sigma_{\text{Angle measurement}}^{\text{Multilayer}}\sim 0.2\) mrad) and the larger \(\int Bd\!l\) closer to the coil.

### Dependence of the resolution on toroid length

We have also studied the impact of the end-cap length on the resolution at \(p_{\perp}=300\) GeV where the resolution is dominated by the measurement error. In this study the multilayer resolution is 70 \(\mu\)m with an alignment error of 30 \(\mu\)m (LoI assumptions) and with a multilayer separation of 35 cm. Three different cases have been studied :* Barrel and end-cap with nominal length,
* End-cap length and barrel half-length reduced by 50 cm (small sagitta chamber shifted in \(z\) by 25 cm and chambers at the end of the barrel and the end-cap shifted in \(z\) by 50 cm),
* End-cap and barrel half length reduced by 100 cm (small sagitta chamber shifted in \(z\) by 50 cm and chambers at the end of the barrel and the end-cap shifted in \(z\) by 100 cm).

Figures 12 and 13 summarize the results for \(\eta\in[1.1,\ 1.9]\) and \(\phi\in[0^{\circ},\ 22.5^{\circ}]\).

In the first case (Fig. 12) the region where \(\frac{\Delta r}{\mathbf{p}}\geq 5\%\) represents only \(\sim 2\%\) of the full acceptance.

In the second case (end-cap and barrel external length reduce by 50 cm, Fig. 13) these areas go up to \(\sim 3\%\) of the overall acceptance. Note that inside the contour the resolution is severely degraded.

In the third case (end-cap and barrel external length reduced by 100 cm, Fig. 13) for about \(\sim 7\%\) of the overall acceptance the momentum resolution is worse than 5%. This third assumption leads clearly to an unacceptable degradation of the muon momentum resolution.

From this study we conclude that the option with the nominal dimensions is close to optimum.

## 9 Conclusions

We have shown that the resolution is only slightly affected in the small phase-space regions where there is a lot of matter traversed by the muon (for \(\phi\leq 5^{\circ}\) and \(\eta\leq 1\)) assuming

Table 8: Chamber parameters and errors assumed in the barrel coil region (\(\phi\leq 5^{\circ}\))that there is an angle measurement for each chamber (which means a multilayer distance, at least, of the order of 20 to 40 cm).

An important issue, presented here, concerns the toroid dimensions. It is important to keep the end-cap length as long as possible in order not to be affected too much by magnetic interaction between the barrel and the end-cap toroid.

Dashed lines represent material from voussoir and cross-braces, ECT cryostats and muon detectors (precision and trigger chambers). Dotted lines correspond to magnet outer conductor centerlines and full lines show the position of the multilayer (\(r\sim 4.8,\ 7.1\) and \(10.4\) meters). Isorapidity (\(\Delta\eta=0.2\)) are shown dotted.
