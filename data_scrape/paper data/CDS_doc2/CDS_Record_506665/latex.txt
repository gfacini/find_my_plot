The EM calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter where absorbers are made of lead and liquid argon is the ionising medium - thus the detector will be placed in a cryostat. Electrodes, separated from the absorbers by honeycomb spacers, collect the signal and set the high voltages. Both electrodes and absorbers have an 'accor-dion' geometry [3]. The calorimeter is segmented in 3 longitudinal samplings: i) _S1_ made of narrow strips to perform \(\gamma\)-\(\pi^{0}\) separation and position measurement. It has a depth of 6 radiation lengths (\(X_{0}\)); ii) _S2_ made of square towers (\(4\times 4\) cm\({}^{2}\) at \(\eta=0\)) with a depth of 18 \(X_{0}\) where most of the energy of e/\(\gamma\) shower is collected; iii) _S3_ with 2 to 12 \(X_{0}\) is used for high energies.

The readout electronics is made of current preamplifiers and shapers, placed outside the cryostat. The signal is sampled, digitised every 25 ns and sent to the control room if accepted by the trigger. The electronics chain has been calibrated continually for each readout channels during the test beam period.

Barrel and endcap modules 0 (full-size final prototypes), equipped with ATLAS-like electronics, were intensively tested during summer 1999 at CERN with 5 to 300 GeV electron and muon beams. The Fig. 2 shows these modules before insertion in the cryostat.

For data analysis, a cluster (typically 3\(\times\)3) is formed in _S2_ around the most energetic cell and then added up with an adequate number of strips and _S3_ cells to compute the total energy, E. Corrections are applied to take into account the finite size of the cluster and the accordion shape of the absorbers. After these corrections,

typical resolutions for both modules are shown in Fig. 3, where \(a\) represents the stochastic term and \(c\) the local constant term. The electronics noise is estimated to be \(\sim\)300 MeV per cluster and has been subtracted from the energy resolution. For muons a signal-to-noise ratio of 4 was obtained.

## Conclusions

Barrel and endcap modules 0 have undergone 3 weeks of intensive beam test at CERN, last year. An energy resolution of \(\frac{\sigma_{B}}{E}\sim\frac{10\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.4\%\oplus\frac{300MeV}{E}\) consistent with simulation has been found for both modules. The overall constant term is still to be obtained.

The module production (32 modules for the barrel and 16 for the endcap) has just started and will last 3 years.
