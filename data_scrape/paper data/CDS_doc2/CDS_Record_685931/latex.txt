**(1) Introduction**

The purpose of this note is to provide a description of the ATLAS pixel detector system so that the pixel detectors may be adequately represented for physics simulations using DICE and ATRECON. It is understood that the design of the pixel system is at a very early stage. While studies of pixel module designs and the overall mechanical design are still under way, it is nevertheless possible to define the dimensions and other properties of a generic pixel system that are suitable for the the simulation needs in preparation of the technical proposal. As the design progresses further, updated simulation geometry descriptions will be released so that the pixel detectors may be adequately represented for future physics simulations.

**(2) Basic Layout and Pixel Size**

The basic dimensions of the pixel system proposed to be implemented in the simulation are given in table (1) below. Alternative layouts are under investigation but the simulation results obtained with the basic layout should be applicable to other layouts. Detector positions and pseudorapidity coverage assumes a 2\(\sigma\) beam size of \(\pm\) 10.6 cm.

**(2.1) Basic dimensions of the proposed pixel layout.**

The pixel system general layout is shown schematically in fig (1). In the barrel region, the radial dimension corresponds to the mean radius of the active detector element, and the half-length represents the distance from the IP to the edge of the active region. In the disk region, the z dimension corresponds to the mid-point between active elements that alternate on either side of the disk structure. The offset of these elements from the mid-point is 0.2 cm. The disk radial dimensions correspond to circles defining the inner and outer edges of the active region. Each disk is made up from 104 wedge-shaped tiles.

The nominal pixel size in the barrel region is 50\(\mu\)m (\(\phi\)) \(\times\) 300\(\mu\)m (z), although other pixel sizes are under consideration [1]. The nominal pixel size is the same for all barrel layers. The nominal pixel size in the disk region is also 50\(\mu\)m (\(\phi\)) and 300\(\mu\)m (r). The pixels in the disk region are not truly radial. The precise layout is described in the section on disk modules below.

located on the outboard edges of the wedges. There are 104 overlapping wedges in one disk; 52 on the front and 52 on the back. The spacing in z between the two overlapping planes of wedges (active silicon to active silicon) is taken to be 0.4 cm. A drawing of a typical module (front and back wedge) is given in fig (3). The pixels within a wedge are arrayed as shown in fig (3). A front and back wedge pair forms one of the 52 trapezoids that form a disk. There is approximately a three pixel overlap at the center of the trapezoid formed by a front and back wedge [see fig (3)] and also at the edges with an adjacent trapezoid. The long dimension of a pixel is parallel to a radius at the center of a trapezoid but not at its edges since the pixels are arrayed in a rectangular pattern.

### (3) Resolution

Since several pixel electronic readout schemes (analog and digital) are still under investigation for the high luminosity LHC application, the ultimate readout resolution is not yet decided, and may be different, for example, in the B physics vertexing layer to the other layers. Table (2) shows the intrinsic resolution achievable with "binary" (s/12) and analog readout. For layers equipped with binary readout, a conservative goal for the \(\phi\) resolution is \(\pm\) 18 \(\mu\)m, including alignment and positioning systematics. In the orthogonal direction (z for cylinders, r for disks), a conservative value for the resolution is \((300\mu\)m/\(\sqrt{1}\)2) = \(\pm\) 87 \(\mu\)m.

With analog readout, an intrinsic \(\phi\) resolution of better than \(\pm\) 7 \(\mu\)m is achievable [3, 4], which when combined with the alignment and positioning precision of \(\pm\) 7 \(\mu\)m, will give an overall spatial resolution in \(\phi\) of \(\pm\) 10 \(\mu\)m. The resolution in z,r will depend on the track incidence, and the crossing point along the 300 \(\mu\)m pixel dimension. Previous pixel resolution studies [3, 4] have shown that the end regions along the pixel long dimension have enhanced resolution - through charge sharing - relative to the central regions, whose resolution is "binary". Fig (4a) illustrates the regions of high and low z,r resolution. We assume that the end 25 \(\mu\)m of one pixel shares charge with the end 25 \(\mu\)m of the next to give an enhanced resolution of 10 \(\mu\)m over an effective area 50 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 50\(\mu\)m. Binary resolution is assumed in the remaining 250 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 50 \(\mu\)m central zone. By weighting the relative areas of the zones of high and low resolution in z,r, we find a weighted z,r resolution of 62 \(\mu\)m for the case of analog readout.

A pixel tiling scheme ["bricking": fig (4b)], with adjacent \(\phi\) rows of pixels shifted in z by half a pixel length (150 \(\mu\)m) will exploit lateral (\(\phi\)) charge sharing (perhaps aided by E\({}^{\Lambda}\)B effects) to further improve the z resolution. An estimate of the z,r resolution is 43 \(\mu\)m, assuming there is always charge sharing in \(\phi\), but ignoring any z,r charge sharing. This value is equal to twice the binary z,r precision for the unbricked case. Taking full account of z,r charge sharing with bricking, we find a second effective 50 \(\mu\)m zone with 10 \(\mu\)m resolution, and two 100 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 50 \(\mu\)m zones with binary resolution. By weighting the relative areas of the zones of high and low resolution in z,r, we find a weighted z,r resolution of 23 \(\mu\)m [table (2)], which probably represents the best z,r resolution achievable.

Since detailed studies of resolution, including the case of a "bricked" array of pixels in the ATLAS geometry have yet to be made in test beams, we have proposed for the purposes of simulation for the technical proposal pixel intrinsic resolutions of 15 \(\mu\)m (\(\phi\)) and 87 \(\mu\)m (z,r) for the case of binary readout, and 7 \(\mu\)m (\(\phi\)) and 43 \(\mu\)m (z,r), in the case of analog readout with bricking, as indicated in table (2).

### (4) Radiation Lengths

The material (X/X0) breakdowns for the B physics (4 cm radius) and high luminosity (11.5 & 16.5 cm) barrel and the disk pixel tile modules, assuming normal incidence, are shown in table (3). The effects of electronics, cooling, cabling and support are averaged over the whole tile area (example: 62.8 x 22.6 mm for barrel pixel tiles) but do not include factors to take account of the overlap in azimuth between adjacent tiles.

Table (3) effectively assumes that the module dimensions will be used in the simulation, which will naturally calculate the overlap factor. If this is not the case, the radiation lengths for the barrel layers at 4 cm, 11.5 cm and 16.5 cm should be increased to take account of azimuthal overlaps occurring;

* between the "full depth" regions (_which include the detector substrate, readout and cabling, plus contributions from all the support elements except for the external beryllium support cylinder_ ) of tiles in a ladder, and the tiles in an adjacent ladder. The full depth regions are 2.06 cm wide, and include an insensitive zone occupied by the pixel column spasification and time stamping logic along the outboard 2 mm of each row of readout chips [fig. (2)]. These regions have effective radiation length 0.77% X/X0 (4 cm layer) and 0.92% X/X0 (11.5 & 16.5 cm layers):

The pixel services must be routed through the gap between the silicon tracker and the first TRT disk. The approximate radiation length of these services is (25cm/R) x 0.89 without the B-physics layer and (25cm/R) x 0.94 with the B-physics layer At the outermost radius these must be added to other services.
