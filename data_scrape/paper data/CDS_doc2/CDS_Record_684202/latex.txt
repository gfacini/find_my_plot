Introduction

This study is based on muons contaminating the high energy electron beams that have been used to test the EM barrel module 0 in July 2000. As muons are minimum ionising particles depositing their energy in a smaller cluster than the electrons, they can provide cleaner or complementary information on the calorimeter. However a muon veto was applied at the trigger level during most of the data taking period. The muon statistics is therefore quite poor and combinations of runs are mandatory to have enough statistics, especially for the study of the \(\eta\)-uniformity. Only 3 runs have been taken without any muon veto, at \(\eta\)=14 and \(\Phi\)=10. They will be referenced in the following as the "lots of muons runs". The studies that their large statistics allows (signal over noise ratio, \(\left(\frac{\mathrm{e}}{\mu}\right)\) ratio, \(\Phi\)-modulation of a cell response, crosstalk) are reported in section 3, the section 2 explaining how the signal is extracted and the muon energy reconstructed. Finally, in section 4 is described the study done on the \(\eta\)-uniformity of the module 0.

## 2 Muon energy reconstruction

### Cuts

The cuts applied to select muons are based on the energy deposited in the calorimeter, on the beam chambers and on the scintillators of the testbeam setup.

The four beam chambers allow to reconstruct the impact position of each event and to know which cell the beam was pointing on. As we are dealing with low energy events, this piece of information is more precise than the weighted barycenter of the module's cells. The third beam chamber is thus used to determine the impact position of the muon events in the calorimeter1 and lead to the following cut :

Footnote 1: the use of the fourth beam chamber has also been tried without any improvement in the cluster building or in the positioning.

* range selection on the third beam chamber x and y coordinates (cuts on xbc3 and ybc3, depending on the run). The x (resp. y) coordinate corresponds to \(\eta\) (resp. \(\Phi\)).

Three scintillators, placed in front of the module 0, are used to trigger physics events by coincidences. The third scintillator provides also the energy deposited by particles. In the case of minimum ionising particles the following cut is required :

* \(800<\mathrm{ADCs3}<1600\) (in ADC counts)

The testbeam setup is also equipped with a pion identifier placed behind the module. It consists of a 10cm thick lead block followed by a scintillator. Pions, unlike muons, start to shower in the lead block and create some secondary particles detected by the scintillator. A low signal in the pion scintillator is therefore required to select muons :

* \(500<\mathrm{pion}<600\) (in ADC counts)

At last, MIP properties of muons imply a selection of events with a low energy deposited in the calorimeter :

* E\({}_{\mathrm{front}}\)+E\({}_{\mathrm{middle}}\)+E\({}_{\mathrm{back}}<\)6 GeVWith such a method, the number of remaining events among the 20,000 initial ones goes typically from 700 to 1000 for standard runs and is up to 8500 for the special "lots of muons" runs.

### Clustering

In the present study, only the information from the middle layer are used. Since the accordion geometry induces a sharing of the energy deposition between two contiguous cells in \(\Phi\) also in the case of minimum ionising particles, the muon signal in the calorimeter is reconstructed by using a \(1\times 2\) cluster in \(\eta\times\Phi\). This is shown in figure 1, which has been obtained with the combination of the 3 "lots of muons runs" : in \(\eta\) (x coordinate of the beam chamber, upper plot), the energy is deposited only in the central cell, whereas in \(\Phi\) (y coordinate of the beam chamber, lower plot), the energy is shared with the closest neighbour.

The choice of the second cell in the cluster is done event by event, according to the y-coordinate of the third beam chamber. For random events, the second cell is chosen randomly.

Crosses are for the central cell (\(\Phi=10\), \(\eta=14\)), empty squares and full circles for its \(\eta\) neighbours (\(\Phi=10\), \(\eta=13\) and \(\Phi=10\), \(\eta=15\)) and empty and full triangles for its \(\Phi\) neighbours (\(\Phi=9\), \(\eta=14\) and \(\Phi=11\), \(\eta=14\)). The vertical lines indicate the cuts done on the third beam chamber coordinates (see section 2.1).

### Muon energy measurement

After amplification and shaping, the analog signals from each cell are sampled at a frequency of 40 MHz. In July 2000, 7 samples were recorded around the signal peak. The energy in each cell is reconstructed :

* either in a crude way, by using a raw conversion in GeV of the ADC counts of the central sample (the fourth one) of the signal. After subtraction of the pedestal, the raw energy is just multiplied by the appropriate gain, which depends on the cell and on the deposited energy.
* or by using the optimal filtering method (see [1] to have an overview of this method). The latter consists in finding some estimators with linear combinations of the seven signal samples. Optimal filtering coefficients used in the present note have been calculated for 250 GeV electrons, as described in [2]. If the electronic chain is linear, they can be applied to low energy events. They are referenced in EMTB as OF4-01 and OF4-04. The latter take into account an absolute electronic calibration (in \(\mu\)A/GeV) to a very good level of accuracy.

Whatever the method is, a correction depending on the temperature of the liquid argon has been applied for each run.

As muons are minimum ionising particles, the energy they deposit when passing through a thin block of matter follows a Landau distribution. This distribution will be characterised in the following by its most probable value. The latter has been obtained by 2 different methods :

1. a fit of the signal with a Landau distribution convoluted with a gaussian [3],
2. a fit of the signal around its peak with a gaussian, the low and high energy tails being trimmed.

The first method is the most natural one. It takes into account the energy deposition of the muons and the limitations of the detector (the results will be presented in more details in section 3) and allows to have a good determination of the absolute energy deposition.

The second method allows to better get rid of the high energy tails which can be due to residuals pions. It gives also a more precise determination of the most probable value because the fit is more simple. It requires however a less natural method :

* trim the tails (1% of lower tails and 15% of upper tails) of the distribution,
* do a gaussian fit on the whole truncated distribution to obtain the mean \(\hat{\mu}\) and the rms \(\sigma\),
* do a gaussian fit between \(\hat{\mu}\)-2.5\(\sigma\) and \(\hat{\mu}\)+\(\sigma\).

This method is the result of different tries. It was found to be very robust against the high energy tails and to give precise measurements of the muon energy.

As a check, the methods have been tested on 17 different runs taken in the same cell at \(\Phi=10\) and \(\eta=14\). The results obtained with the gaussian fit are presented in figure 2, which shows the relative muon energy found for each run. The plot has been normalised such as the mean is equal to 1. The first 10 points correspond to runs with low statistics, the 4 next ones to standard physics runs (as used for example in the uniformity study, see section 4) and the 3 last ones to the "lots of muons" runs. All the results are compatible within the errors. This is confirmed by the distribution of the pulls of each run \(i\), defined as :

\[\left(\mathrm{pull}\right)_{i}=\frac{\mathrm{E}_{i}-\mathrm{mean}}{\sigma_{i}} \tag{1}\]

\(\mathrm{E}_{i}\) and \(\sigma_{i}\) being the result and the error bar of each individual run.

This pull distribution is shown in figure 3. It is compatible with a gaussian distribution which is centered on 0 and has an rms of 1. This is a consistency check that all the results are compatible within the errors and that the latter are well evaluated.

The results that will be presented in the next sections are independent of the fitting method used to determine the muon energy.

Results at \(\eta\)=14 and \(\Phi\)=10

The three runs that have been taken without any muon veto provide an interesting muon statistics in the cell at \(\eta=14\) and \(\Phi\)=10. In this section are reported the studies done to extract the signal over noise ratio, the \(\left(\frac{e}{\mu}\right)\) ratio, the \(\Phi\)-modulation of the cell response and the crosstalk.

### Signal over noise ratio and \(\left(\frac{e}{\mu}\right)\) ratio

In this subsection (and only here), we are interested in the determination of the absolute muon energy deposition. The energy scale is calibrated by adjusting the reconstructed peak of the electrons to the beam energy (119.7\(\pm\)0.1 GeV). The absolute muon energies will therefore suffer from the non-perfect linearity of the calorimeter, which is assumed conservatively to be 1%. The muon energies will be given in the following with 2 error bars, the first one being statistical and the second one coming from the determination of the absolute energy scale.

The distributions of the \(1\times 2\) cluster energy reconstructed with optimal filtering for muons and for random events are shown in figure 4 (a).

Figure 4: Muon signal and noise distribution (a) with optimal filtering and (b) with a raw conversion between ADC counts and GeV (see section 2.3). The signal is fitted with a Landau convoluted with a gaussian and the noise is fitted with a gaussian. The absolute energy scale is calibrated with the electrons.

The random events distribution is fitted with a gaussian, whose sigma represents the noise in one cluster : 40.9\(\pm\)0.4\(\pm\)0.4 MeV.

The signal is fitted with a Landau distribution convoluted with a gaussian :

* the peak of the signal (most probable energy) is 290.8\(\pm\)0.6\(\pm\)3 MeV,
* the sigma of the gaussian convoluted with the Landau distribution is found to be \(38\pm 1\pm 0.4\) MeV, which is comparable to the noise,
* the FWHM of the signal is 142\(\pm\)1\(\pm\)1 MeV.

The resulting signal to noise ratio, defined as the muon most probable energy divided by the noise, is \(7.11\pm 0.07\). It could be slightly increased by using the signal in the strips [4].

The same distributions obtained by using the raw conversion between ADC counts of the fourth sample and GeV to reconstruct the energy (instead of the optimal filtering method, see section 2.3) are shown in figure 4 (b). The muon most probable energy is 282.7\(\pm\)0.9\(\pm\)3 MeV and the noise in one cluster is 71.2\(\pm\)0.7\(\pm\)0.7 MeV. The resulting signal to noise ratio is 3.97\(\pm\)0.04. The sigma of the gaussian convoluted with the Landau distribution to fit the muon signal is found to be 67\(\pm\)1\(\pm\)0.7 MeV, which is also compatible with the noise.

The optimal filtering method allows to decrease the noise by a factor 1.7 and to increase the signal over noise ratio by a factor 1.8.

The \(\left(\frac{\mathrm{e}}{\mu}\right)\) ratio can be deduced from the determination of the absolute muon energy deposition by the following formula :

\[E_{\mu}=E_{\mu}^{\mathrm{measured}}\cdot\frac{E_{\mathrm{beam}}}{E_{e-}^{ \mathrm{measured}}}=\left(\frac{\mu}{\mathrm{e}}\right)\cdot\frac{1}{\mathrm{S }_{\mathrm{fraction}}}\cdot\left(\frac{dE}{dX}\right)_{\mu}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{ \mathrm{argon}} \tag{2}\]

with \(\mathrm{S}_{\mathrm{fraction}}\) being the sampling fraction taken to 0.252. The parameter \(\left(\frac{dE}{dX}\right)_{\mu}\cdot\mathrm{L}_{\mathrm{argon}}\) has been derived from simulations and found to be equal to 53.88\(\pm\)0.02 MeV at \(\eta\)=14.

As a result, we find :

\[\left(\frac{\mathrm{e}}{\mu}\right)=0.75\pm 0.03 \tag{3}\]

As a byproduct, the position resolution in \(\Phi\) has also been looked at. By using the barycenter of the \(1\times 2\) cluster in the middle layer, a resolution between 2.05\(\pm\)0.07 and 2.25\(\pm\)0.05 mrad, depending on the impact position, is obtained.

### \(\Phi\)-modulation of the cell response

The modulation with \(\Phi\) of the response of a cell to an electron signal is well known [5]. Its structure has 4 main peaks, with an amplitude of about 1.5%. This corresponds mainly to the variation of the accordion shape, due to the impossibility for the absorber waves to have strictly sharp bends. Since the sampling depth is constant with \(\Phi\), the argon and absorber thicknesses are complementary. This creates the same kind of modulation in the case of muons.

In the electron case, the modulation is however limited by the transverse size of the electromagnetic showers, which are typically of 4 to 10 consecutive gaps. This induces a smoothing of the modulation. In the muon case, which are almost minimum ionising particles, the transverse size of the region where ionisation is deposited is very small, inducing a larger modulation.

The energy deposited in the middle layer by muons passing through the cell at \(\eta=14\) and \(\Phi\)=10 is shown as a function of the y-coordinate of the third beam chamber (corresponding to \(\Phi\)) in figure 5. The plot has been normalised such as the mean is equal to 1. The horizontal range corresponds to the whole cell. The beam did not cover the rightmost part of the cell in these high statistics runs. As expected, a modulation with 4 main peaks per cell is obtained (only 3 are visible). These peaks correspond to the 4 argon gaps. The amplitude of the modulation is about 6%, which is 4 times larger than with electrons.

Figure 5: Modulation of the calorimeter response recorded by the middle layer to muons along the \(\Phi\) direction (represented by the y-coordinate of the third beam chamber) at \(\eta\)=14. The horizontal range corresponds to the whole cell, whose center is indicated by the vertical line. The plot has been normalised to 1. A fit with 2 sinusoidal functions is superimposed.

### Crosstalk

Measurements of the crosstalk in the EM barrel Module 0 extracted from August 1999, May 2000 and July 2000 beam tests by using calibration runs have been reported [6][7]. Unlike electrons, muons can provide a mean to test these results by using physics runs.

A complete map of the module (as done with calibration runs) can not be done because of the lack of statistics in most of the cells. Thanks to the "lots of muons" runs, the crosstalk has been measured in the cells around \(\eta=14\) and \(\Phi\)=10 when a muon is passing through. This measurement is based on an event by event analysis. For the cell at \(\Phi\)=9 (resp. \(\Phi\)=11), only the events for which the cell at \(\Phi\)=11 (resp. \(\Phi\)=9) is used in the cluster are selected. The results are shown in figure 6.

These results can not be directly compared to those obtained at the peak of the signal by using calibration runs [7], which are recalled in brackets in figure 6. Indeed, during calibration runs, several cells are pulsed simultaneously, inducing a superposition of several crosstalks. During physics runs, only the central cell and one of its \(\Phi\)-neighbour record a signal. The agreement between the results obtained here and those extracted from calibration runs is however correct. As a check, the result obtained in the cell \(\eta=4\) and \(\Phi\)=10, which is very far from the central cell, is found to be \(0.2\%\pm 0.2\), which is compatible with the noise.

Figure 6: Schematic of the crosstalk values found in the cells around \(\eta=14\) and \(\Phi\)=10 by using muons. The number in brackets refer to the results obtained with calibration runs at the peak of the signal [7]. In the latter case, several cells are pulsed simultaneously.

As a second check, the shapes of the crosstalk signals have been looked at in order to verify their inductive behaviour. It is shown in figure 7 (a) for the cell at \(\eta=13\) and \(\Phi\)=10, together with the signal in the central cell (\(\eta=14\), \(\Phi\)=10). The crosstalk signal is magnified by a factor 30. It exhibits a clear inductive behaviour, being close to the second derivative of the signal with a fast first peak. As a comparison, the shapes recorded with calibration runs in the same cells are shown in figure 7 (b). As expected, the shapes are similar and have an inverse polarity [8].

Results on \(\eta\)-uniformity

### Introduction

Preliminary analyses of the electron data taken in August 99', May 00' and July 00', show a non-uniformity of the module response along the \(\eta\) direction [9] at the level of few percents. This non-uniformity has a 8-fold periodicity and is thought to be due to missing ground springs in the readout connector of the electrodes. Obtaining complementary information to those given by electrons scans is therefore very important in order to confirm (or not) the proposed explanation. This section gives conclusive results with muons.

The study concerns the A electrodes of the module. It is based on four \(\eta\)-scans, each with 31 runs (one run per cell of the A electrode, no run taken in the first cell at \(\eta=0\)). Three scans are taken at \(\phi=10\) (two at a beam energy of 245 GeV and one at 99 GeV) and one is taken at \(\phi=9\) (with a beam energy of 245 GeV). As muons are minimum ionising particles, these scans with different beam energies can be merged.

The muon energies are calculated by using the raw conversion between ADC counts and GeV for the results given in subsection 4.2. The subsection 4.3 compares these results with those obtained by using the optimal filtering method. The energy reconstruction methods are described in more details in section 2.3. When using the optimal filtering method, only 3 scans are used because of the lack of optimal filtering coefficients for the cells at \(\phi=8\), which are needed for the scan at \(\phi=9\).

### Results

The results obtained for one individual scan is presented in figure 8. As muons are minimum ionising particles, their deposited energy in the middle sampling is proportional to the argon length through which they have gone, which is also proportional to the X0 thickness of the cell. This explains the global shape of the plot and its correlation to the X0 thickness, which is superimposed in the figure 8. The X0 depth of the middle layer is deduced from the figure 9, where the thicknesses of the three layers of the module 0 are shown.

The same scan after compensation of the dependency on the middle thickness is shown in figure 10 (a). As we are only interested in the relative energies, the plot has been normalised such as the mean energy is equal to 1. Because of the low muon statistics in each run, the error bars are quite large (about 2% on each spot). Therefore no conclusion can be drawn on the uniformity at this level. The points at \(\eta\) equal 7 and 9 correspond to unstable cells and have been removed from the plot, as in the following figures.

To improve the statistics, a combination of 4 different scans has been made. The results of this combination are shown in figure 10 (b). The error bars have been decreased by a factor 2 and are now at the level of 1% on each point. This allows to see that the right cells of the readout connectors of the electrode (\(\eta=15\), 23 and 31, no point for \(\eta=7\)) are above the others, respectively of about 4%, 3%, and 2%, which begins to be significant. The global energy spread is 1.6%.

Figure 8: Raw muon energy scan in electrode A as a function of \(\eta\) (circles with error bars). The two points at \(\eta\) equal 7 and 9 correspond to unstable cells. The depth of the middle layer is superimposed in arbitrary units (full squares). Figure 9: Depth of the three layers of the module 0 (from bottom to top: strips, middle and back) in X0 units [10].

In order to go further, it can be remarked that, in the electron case, the non-uniformity has a 8-fold periodicity. By summing the spots with the same 8-fold periodicity, a further increase in statistics of a factor 2 is obtained. The results are shown in figure 11 (full circles), as a function of \(\eta\) modulo 8. The pattern is now clearer : the first four points are uniform within 0.5%, whereas the four last points gradually increase to 4% above the first ones. The global shape is the same than the one obtained with the electrons. It tends to confirm the effect due to the missing ground connector. The price of the folding, which allows to see clearly the pattern, is that information on a larger scale non-uniformity are lost.

Figure 11: Relative muon energy as a function of \(\eta\), after combination of 4 scans and folding of the cells with the same 8-fold \(\eta\)-periodicity. The full circles correspond to the raw conversion between ADC counts and GeV, the empty triangles are related to the optimal filtering coefficients OF4-01 (only third and eighth points) and the empty squares are related to the optimal filtering coefficients OF4-04 (see section 2.3 for more details). Error bars are at the level of 0.4-0.5%.

This result is obtained after combinations of the results of 116 different runs. We checked the validity of the method by plotting the pull factor of each run with respect to the point of the figure 11 it is related to :

\[\left(\mathrm{pull}\right)_{i}=\frac{\mathrm{E}_{i}-\left(\mathrm{mean}\right)_ {i}}{\sigma_{i}} \tag{4}\]

\(\mathrm{E}_{i}\) and \(\sigma_{i}\) being the result and the error bar of each individual run, and \(\mathrm{mean}_{i}\) being the mean energy after combination of the scans and folding of \(\eta\) modulo 8. The distribution of these pull factors is shown in figure 12. It is fitted with a gaussian, whose mean is 0 and \(\sigma\) is compatible with 1. This is a consistency check that the method is correct.

### Comparison with/without optimal filtering

The same study has been done by using the optimal filtering method instead of the raw conversion between ADC counts and energy (section 2.3).

The optimal filtering coefficients OF4-04 take into account an absolute electronic calibration. It has been demonstrated with the electron data that their use allows a great improvement on the \(\eta\)-uniformity of the module [11]. The results obtained with muons are shown in figure 11 (empty squares). They confirm this improvement, the response of the 8 points being now uniform within 0.4%.

Figure 12: Pull distribution of the 116 studied runs. The definition of the pull factors is given by equation 4. A gaussian fit is superimposed.

The 4% correction on the last point that the use of these coefficients allows is due for one part to the optimal filtering method and for the other part to the absolute electronic calibration. In order to disentangle both contributions, optimal filtering coefficients OF4-01, which do not take into account an absolute electronic calibration, have been used on the third and the eighth points (empty triangles on figure 11). The eighth point is above the lowest ones from roughly 2.5%, instead of 4% with the ADC to GeV method. The use of an absolute electronic calibration allows to correct for these remaining 2.5% non-uniformities.

## 5 Conclusions

Muons contaminating the high energy electron beams have been used to test the EM barrel module 0. As a muon veto was applied at the trigger level during most of the data taking period, the muons statistics is quite poor and combinations of runs have been applied. Specific muons scans during the future test campaigns would greatly help.

By using only the middle layer of the calorimeter, the signal over noise ratio reaches 7.11\(\pm\)0.07 if an optimal filtering method is used and 3.97\(\pm\)0.04 with a raw conversion between ADC counts and GeV. The \(\left(\frac{\mathrm{s}}{\mu}\right)\) ratio is measured to \(0.75\pm 0.02.\) As expected, the \(\Phi\)-modulation of a cell response is larger with muons than with electrons and reaches 6% at the peak. Muons provide also a mean to confirm the crosstalk measurements done with calibration runs. Finally, a study of the \(\eta\)-uniformity of the module has been done with muons. By using a raw conversion between ADC counts and GeV, a non-uniformity of 4% (peak to peak) with a 8-fold periodicity is seen. The use of optimal filtering coefficients taking into account an absolute electronic calibration of the detector allows a great improvement, the response being uniform within 0.4%. This confirms that the origin of the non-uniformities is probably a missing ground spring in the readout connector of the electrodes.
