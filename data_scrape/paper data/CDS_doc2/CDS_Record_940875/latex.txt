**Abstract**

The spatial resolution of a single drift tube in monitored-drift-tube (MDT) chambers of the ATLAS muon spectrometer has to be known in order to ensure optimal muon track reconstruction. In the present note, an iterative procedure and its improvement which allows the in-situ determination of the spatial resolution is described. Both methods do not need an external reference, but use the tracks reconstructed in the drift-tube chambers. Results obtained with both methods on simulated and experimental data are shown.

Introduction

The ATLAS muon spectrometer is designed for the measurement of the transverse muon momenta with an accuracy of 3-10% in a wide momentum range between 10 and 1000 GeV/c [1]. This is achieved by the precise reconstruction of muon trajectories in a typically 0.4 T field of a superconducting air-core toroid magnet. The trajectories are measured in three stations of monitored-drift-tube (MDT) chambers. The barrel chambers form three cylindrical layers coaxial with the beam, the inner, middle, and outer layer, BI, BM and BO. The end-cap chambers are arranged in four disks, the inner, extra, middle and outer disk, EI, EE, EM and EO. The muons traverse the chambers at different angles of incidence depending on the pseudorapidity region. The chambers will operate in conditions of large neutron and photon background count rates from 40 to 500 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) including a safety factor of 5.

The MDT chambers consist of three or four layers of cylindrical aluminium drift tubes of 30 mm diameter with only 0.4 mm wall thickness, on each side of an aluminium support frame. Most of the chambers have six layers of drift tubes. The characteristic geometry of such a chamber is depicted in Figure 1. In the inner muon spectrometer region where the background hit rates are the highest there is an additional fourth tube layer in each multilayer in order to improve the pattern recognition.

The drift tubes contain a 50 \(\mu\)m diameter gold-plated tungsten-rhenium sense wire at the center and are filled with Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) (93:7) gas mixture at a pressure of 3 bar. Operated at a gas gain of 2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\), the drift tubes must provide a spatial resolution of better than 100 \(\mu\)m in order to achieve the required chamber resolution of 40 \(\mu\)m.

The reconstruction of particle trajectories from the hits in the drift-tube chambers requires the precise knowledge of the spatial resolution of the drift tubes if optimum performance is desired. The spatial resolution depends on the operating conditions. For example, it depends on the density and the gas gain of the gas the drift tubes are filled with and even on the level of photon and neutron irradiation in which they are operated [2]. Since we expect these operating conditions to vary during the operation in the ATLAS detector, the drift-tube resolution will have to be re-measured several times during the experiment. In the present note, we first describe an iterative procedure which is commonly used in order to determine the spatial resolution. We shall then

explain the drawbacks of this conventional approach and develop a faster and more reliable method. Both methods do not need an external reference, but use the tracks reconstructed in the drift-tube chambers.

## 2 The Iterative Approach

The spatial resolution of a drift tube can be determined by an iterative method which relies only on the muon hits recorded in the drift-tube chamber.

The principle of the measurement is illustrated in Figure 2. The resolution \(\sigma_{j}(r)\) of the track point \(j\) is obtained by comparing the measured drift radius \(r_{j}\) with the value \(r_{j}^{(fit)}\) predicted from the reconstructed trajectory. The track fit is performed through all track points \(i\) measured by the chamber excluding the track point \(j\). The drift tube resolution is determined from the difference of the variance \(Var\left(r_{j}-r_{j}^{(fit)}\right)\) of the track residuals and the variance \(\sigma_{fit}^{2}\left(r_{j}^{(fit)}\right)\) of the track fit at the radius \(r_{j}\):

\[\sigma^{2}(r_{j})=Var\left(r_{j}-r_{j}^{(fit)}\right)-\sigma_{fit}^{2}\left(r_ {j}^{(fit)}\right). \tag{1}\]

In the appendix A we show that the variance of the track fit itself depends on the spatial resolutions \(\sigma(r_{i})\) of the track points \(i\neq j\) entering the track fit. The resolution \(\sigma(r_{j})\) is therefore determined iteratively. One starts with a first estimate \(\tilde{\sigma}_{(0)}(r)\) of the resolution and computes a first estimate of the track fit variance \(\sigma_{(0)fit}^{2}\left(r_{j}^{fit}\right)\) assuming that the resolution curve is the same in all drift tubes. Using the first estimates one obtains the new resolution curve

\[\sigma_{(1)}^{2}\left(r_{j}\right)=Var\left(r_{j}-r_{j}^{(fit)}\right)-\sigma_ {(0)fit}^{2}\left(r_{j}^{(fit)}\right). \tag{2}\]

In the next iteration step, we replace the first estimates \(\tilde{\sigma}_{(0)i}\) in the expression for the track fit variance with the new result \(\sigma_{(1)i}\). The iterations continue until the results agree within a certain limit \(\lambda\) after the \(n^{th}\) iteration:

\[|\sigma_{(n)}(r_{j})-\sigma_{(n-1)}(r_{j})|<\lambda. \tag{3}\]

Figure 2: Illustration of the spatial resolution measurement for the drift tube in the third layer. This tube is excluded from the track reconstruction and the measured radius \(r_{3}\) is compared with the prediction \(r^{(fit)}\) of the track fit.

The validity of the relation \(\sigma_{fit}\left(r^{(fit)}\right)<\sigma(r)\) guarantees the numerical stability of the method. The smaller the variance of the track fit compared to the spatial resolution, the less sensitive the procedure will be to the initial resolution estimate.

### Variance of the Track Fit in 8-Layer and 6-Layer Chambers

The variance of the track fit computed in an 8-layer chamber will be considerably smaller than in the 6-layer chambers due to the larger number of track points entering the track reconstruction. Contrary to the chambers with six layers, the distance \(L\) between the multilayers in an 8-layer chamber is of the same order or even smaller than the depth \(l\) of a multilayer (compare Figure 1) so that all track points contribute almost equally to the determination of the resolution of \(r^{(fit)}\) which diminishes \(\sigma_{(fit)}^{2}\left(r^{(fit)}\right)\). This is different for a 6-layer chamber with large multilayer spacing because only two or three hits in one multilayer contribute to determination of \(r^{(fit)}\).

Figure 3 shows the variance \(\sigma_{fit}^{2}\left(r_{i}^{(fit)}\right)\) as a function of \(r_{i}^{(fit)}\), for the layers \(i=1,2,3,(4)\) numbered starting from the outermost towards the innermost layer of a given multilayer (compare Figure 2). The results are obtained using the actual geometry of a 6-layer BOS MDT chamber with L=316.9 mm and l=82.1 mm (Figure 3a) and the geometry of an 8-layer BIS MDT chamber with L=8 mm and l=107.9 mm (Figure 3b). The variance of the track fit is smallest when the tube in the innermost layer is excluded from the fit which is therefore preferred for the determination of the drift tube resolution. In the following sections we concentrate on the determination of the spatial resolution in 6-layer chambers.

The full lines shows the result obtained when the outermost tube layer (hit \(r_{1}\)) is excluded from the track fit, the dashed line is obtained for the middle layer(s), the dotted line when excluding a hit in the innermost layer.

### Monte Carlo Study of the Convergence

In the following subsection we test the accuracy and the convergence of the iterative procedure applied on the muon trajectories at different angles of incidence on the 6-layer chamber. We test separately the performance of the method when applying the straight and the curved track fit.

#### 2.2.1 Data Sets and Initial Resolution Estimates

Straight particle tracks traversing a MDT chamber of a type BOS are simulated using the MTGEANT-4 programme [3]. The tracks traverse the chamber at angles of incidence \(\theta\) of \(0^{o}\), \(13^{o}\), \(24^{o}\), \(30^{o}\), \(41^{o}\), \(45^{o}\), \(51^{o}\) which correspond to the actual angles of muon trajectories through the BOS chambers in the ATLAS detector. In addition we simulate curved muon tracks at zero angle of incidence with curvatures corresponding to the transverse momenta of 20, 40 and 80 GeV/c in a magnetic filed of 0.4 T. For each configuration of track parameters 50 000 tracks are simulated uniformly distributed over three tubes in each layer. The chamber response to muons is characterized by the spatial drift tube resolution \(\sigma(r)\) as shown in Figure 4 which is common for all tubes.

One expects the number of iterations needed to reach convergence to decrease with increasing accuracy of the initial resolution estimate. We study the convergence for the three different initial resolution curves shown in Figure 4:

\((i)\) The true resolution \(\sigma(r)\).

\((ii)\) A small deviation \(\delta(r)\) from the true resolution \(\tilde{\sigma}_{(0)}(r)=\sigma(r)+\delta(r)\).

\((iii)\) A constant resolution of \(\tilde{\sigma}_{(0)}(r)\)=const=0.06 mm.

In the first case, we test the limits on the accuracy of the method. Since we start with the true resolution, we expect the method to converge after only one iteration step. The deviation from the true resolution corresponds to the intrinsic accuracy of the method. In the second case - most realistic

Figure 4: The true drift tube resolution \(\sigma\) (full line) and two different initial resolution estimates \(\tilde{\sigma}_{(0)}\) (the dashed and the dotted line) as a function of the drift distance \(r\).

for the ATLAS detector - the deviation \(\delta(r)\) is on the order of the change in resolution due to the maximum photon and neutron background radiation expected in ATLAS. The third, extreme case with large deviation from the true resolution curve presents the biggest challenge for the convergence of the iteration method.

We choose the limit \(\lambda\)=2 \(\mu\)m as the convergence criterion. The difference \(r_{4}-r_{4}^{(fit)}\) is histogrammed in 30 equidistant bins from 0 to 15 mm. The variance \(Var(r_{4}-r_{4}^{(fit)})\) and the average variance of the track fit are computed separately for each bin. For angles of incidence different from 0 the variance of the track fit depends on whether the excluded hit \(r_{4}\) appears above or below the wire in Figure 2. The two cases are treated separately in order to keep the spread of the track fit variances in one bin small.

#### 2.2.2 Iterative Approach with a Straight Track Fit

Taking the true resolution as the initial resolution estimate (case (i)), the iteration procedure converges as expected after only one or two steps. If the approximation \(\sigma_{(1)}(r_{4})\) differs from the true resolution by more than 2 \(\mu\)m, a second iteration occasionally is needed. The difference between the calculated and the true resolution curve as a function of the impact radius \(r^{(fit)}\) is shown in Figure 5 for different angles of incidence.

The number of iterations needed to reach the convergence increases as soon as the initial estimate differs from the true resolution. For a difference \(\delta(r)\) corresponding to the effect of the maximum expected background irradiation in ATLAS, three to seven iterations are needed. As an example, the differences \((\sigma_{i}-\sigma)\) obtained in the \(i^{th}\) iteration step (\(i=1,..,6\)) for tracks with \(13^{o}\) angle of incidence are shown in Figure 6. One observes a typical alternation of over- and an underestimates of the resolution from one iteration step to the next. The difference \(\sigma_{i}-\sigma_{i-1}\) converges to zero.

Figure 5: The difference between the measured resolution \(\sigma_{(n)}\) and the true resolution as a function of the impact radius for different angles of incidence and for tracks traversing the tube below the anode wire.

The deviation of the obtained resolution \(\sigma_{n}\) from the true resolution \(\sigma\) can be expressed quantitatively in terms of the width \(D_{rms}=\sqrt{\left[\sum\limits_{bin}\left(\sigma_{n}-\sigma\right)^{2}\right]/N _{bins}}\). In the first iteration one reaches only a limited accuracy of 10-40 \(\mu\)m. After a sufficient number of iteration steps, the method always converges to the true resolution curve. The average accuracy of the iteration procedure for a sample of 25 000 muon tracks is about 2 \(\mu\)m. Even with the large error in the initial resolution estimate (case (iii)), the iterative method converges to the true resolution curve. The accuracy is similar as in the case of the true initial resolution, however, with a larger number of iteration steps. The accuracies obtained in the final iteration step are shown in Table 1 for three different initial resolution estimates. The total number of iteration steps \(n\) is given as well.

#### 2.2.3 Iterative Approach with a Curved Track Fit

Since the muon chambers will be operated in a magnetic field of 0.3-1.2 T, only the trajectories of highly energetic muons can be considered as straight lines. It is therefore of interest to test the performance of the resolution measurement method with curved trajectories. We modify expression (1) for the determination of the resolution for the curved tracks:

\[\sigma^{2}(r_{j})=Var\left(r_{j}-r_{j}^{(cfit)}\right)-\sigma_{cfit}^{2}\left(r_ {j}^{(cfit)}\right), \tag{4}\]

where \(r_{j}^{(cfit)}\) is the radial distance of the fitted curved track \(y=\sum\limits_{k=1}^{3}\alpha_{k}z^{(k-1)}\) through the measured hit points and \(\sigma_{cfit}^{2}\left(r_{j}^{(cfit)}\right)\) the variance of \(r_{j}^{(cfit)}\) measurement. The expression for the true and the estimated variance of the curved track fit are derived in appendix B. The ratios of the track fit variance and the squared true spatial resolution are shown in Figure 7 for the perpendicular muon trajectories. Compared to the straight line fit, the curved track fit has a significantly larger error exceeding the spatial resolution in most cases. We therefore expect the iteration method to be very sensitive to the initial resolution estimate.

The first test of the modified iterative method is performed on the data samples of straight muon tracks at different angles of incidence used previously. As an example, we show in Figure 8 the resolution curves \(\sigma_{(n)}\) obtained in the \(n^{th}\) iteration step performed on the sample of 25 000 perpendicular straight muon tracks. The initial resolution estimate is the same as for the case \((ii)\) in the previous subsection. Since the initial resolution estimate is above the true resolution, the first iteration step gives an overestimated resolution \(\sigma_{(1)}\) with deviation from the true value \(D_{rms}\)=20 \(\mu\)m. In the next step, the

Figure 7: The ratio between the variance \(\sigma_{fit}^{2}(r_{4}^{fit})\) of the track fit and the squared true drift-tube resolution \(\sigma^{2}(r_{4})\) shown for perpendicular muon tracks. The full (dashed) line represents the values obtained for the curved (straight) track fit.

resolution \(\sigma_{(2)}\) is underestimated, etc. Note that the deviation from the true resolution _increases_ with increasing number of iterations. The iteration procedure diverges for the curved track fit. After the fourth iteration, the estimated variance of the track fit is already larger than the variance \(Var(r-r^{(fit)})\). Similar observations hold for other angles of incidence.

## 3 The Analytical Approach

The limitations of the iteration method require a new approach for the determination of the drift-tube resolution. In this section, we describe an alternative method which is not sensitive to the initial estimate.

For a given angle of incidence \(\theta\), the variance

\[Var\left(r_{4}-r_{4}^{(fit)}\right)=\sigma^{2}(r_{4})+\sigma_{fit}^{2}\left(r_ {4}^{(fit)}\right), \tag{5}\]

with

\[\sigma_{fit}^{2}\left(r_{4}^{(fit)}\right)=f\left(\sigma(r_{i}),\theta\right), \tag{6}\]

depends only on the resolution curve (see the exact analytical expressions in appendices A and B). We parameterize the resolution curve with Legendre polynomials \(P_{l}(r)\),

\[\sigma(r)=\sum_{l=1}^{7}c_{l}\cdot P_{l}(r), \tag{7}\]

Figure 8: The resolution curves measured in \(n^{th}\) iteration step for perpendicular muon tracks. The initial resolution estimate was the dashed line in Figure 4. The curved track fit was performed on tracks traversing the tube below the anode wire. The true resolution curve is shown as dashed line.

and determine the unknown parameters \(c_{l}\) by minimizing the sum over \(r_{4}\)-bins

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{r_{4}\in(0,R)}\frac{1}{\sigma_{fit}^{2}(r_{4}^{(fit)})}\left[\sqrt {Var(r_{4}-r_{4}^{(fit)})}-\sqrt{\sigma^{2}(r_{4})+\sigma_{fit}^{2}(r_{4}^{(fit) })}\right]^{2}. \tag{8}\]

In this way, the resolution curve is obtained without iterations. A possible dependence on the initial resolution estimate occurs only in the selection of hit points for the track reconstruction which must not exceed a maximum allowed distance from the reconstructed track. Since this is a second order effect, we might need one additional iteration step only in the case of a large deviation from the true resolution. We now evaluate the accuracy of the analytical method by comparing the result \(\sigma_{(n)}(r)\) with the true resolution curve \(\sigma(r)\). The studies are performed on the Monte Carlo data samples described in the previous section.

### Analytical Approach with a Straight Track Fit

Independent of the initial resolution estimate \(\sigma_{(0)}(r)\), the final result is obtained with the analytical method already _in the first step_. In the case of a large initial deviation \(\delta(r)=\sigma_{(0)}(r)-\sigma(r)\) from the true resolution \(\sigma(r)\), a second iteration is needed to confirm the convergence: \(|\sigma_{2}-\sigma_{1}|<\lambda\). Table 2 shows the standard deviation \(D_{rms}\) of the difference between the obtained and the true resolution curves. The three cases correspond to the three initial resolution estimates described in the previous section. The accuracy of the analytical procedure does not depend on the accuracy of the initial resolution estimate.

The accuracy of the resolution determination is shown in Figure 9 for the analytical approach in comparison with the iterative method as a function of the number of muon tracks. The accuracy of the analytical procedure is slightly better compared to the iterative method. About 5000 muon tracks are needed for a 2 \(\mu\)m accuracy. With less than 500 tracks, both methods do not give reliable results.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline  & \(Case\)\(i\)) & \(Case\)\(ii\)) & \(Case\)\(iii)\) \\ Angle & \(D_{rms}\) (\(\mu\)m) & \(D_{rms}\) (\(\mu\)m) & \(D_{rms}\) (\(\mu\)m) \\ \hline \hline \(0^{o}\) & 1.1 & 1.2 & 0.9 \\ \(13^{o}\) & 1.7 & 1.8 & 1.5 \\ \(24^{o}\) & 2.8 & 1.7 & 1.8 \\ \(30^{o}\) & 1.2 & 1.6 & 1.4 \\ \(41^{o}\) & 2.5 & 1.3 & 1.3 \\ \(45^{o}\) & 3.0 & 3.6 & 2.7 \\ \(51^{o}\) & 2.3 & 2.9 & 2.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Analytical Approach with a Curved Track Fit

The real advantage of the analytical method becomes evident for the curved track fit. We showed already, with samples of simulated straight tracks, that in this case the iteration method does not converge. On the other hand, the analytical method converges to the true resolution with high accuracy. We test the performance of the analytical procedure with curved track fit for straight muon tracks at different angles of incidence as well as for curved muon tracks at zero angle of incidence and with transverse momenta of 20, 40, and 80 GeV/c in a magnetic field of 0.4 T. Table 3 shows \(D_{rms}\) for the three different initial resolution estimates. Independent of the initial resolution

estimate, the analytical method determines the spatial resolution curve with an accuracy of 5 \(\mu\)m already after the first iteration step. A better accuracy obtained for the tracks with finite curvature can be explained by the fact that in these samples the \(\delta\)-rays, which distort the \(Var(r-r^{fit})\)-distributions were not simulated.

## 4 Performance under the Influence of \(\gamma\)-Irradiation

The performance of the methods for the resolution measurement relies on a reliable selection of the hit points originating from a muon. \(\delta\)-rays and photon and neutron background hits distort the \(Var(r-r^{fit})\)-distribution and degrade the accuracy of the resolution measurement. A 6-layer BOS chamber has been tested in a muon beam under the influence of photon background irradiation in the X5 test-beam at the Gamma Irradiation Facility at CERN. The muon tracks traversed the chamber at \(0^{o}\) angle of incidence. Their trajectories are also recorded in a silicon strip detector telescope used as external reference allowing for an independent resolution measurement \(\sigma_{STEL}(r)\).

Figure 10a shows the resolution curves \(\sigma_{STEL}(r)\) for three different photon irradiation rates. The resolution degrades with increasing irradiation rate due to the increasing effect of space charge fluctuations [4]. Similar resolution curves \(\sigma_{fit}(r)\) are obtained from the track reconstruction in the chamber alone. The differences of the resolution determined by the analytical method with respect the external measurement are shown in Figure 10b. Within the statistical errors, which are given by the size of the data sample, both methods provide the same results.

Figure 10: a) Resolution curves \(\sigma_{STEL}(r)\) measured with the silicon telescope as external reference for three different irradiation rates. b) Difference \(\sigma_{fit}(r_{4})-\sigma_{STEL}(r_{4})\) between the results of the analytical method and the external measurement for the three irradiation rates. (The average difference is given for each case.)

Influence of the Angular Spread of the Muon Tracks

Up to now we have treated the muon trajectories with different track slopes and curvatures separately. In reality, one will rather have an angular spread of trajectories traversing a muon chamber. Since the variance of the track fit \(\sigma_{fit}^{2}\left(r^{(fit)}\right)\) depends on the angle of incidence \(\theta\), one would approximately calculate the spatial resolution by introducing an average \(\left\langle\theta\right\rangle\) over the angular spread into equations 5 and 6, i.e.

\[\left\langle Var\left(r_{4}-r_{4}^{(fit)}\right)\right\rangle_{\theta}=\sigma^ {2}(r_{4})+\left\langle\sigma_{fit}^{2}\left(r^{(fit)}\right)\right\rangle_{ \theta}, \tag{9}\]

with

\[\left\langle\sigma_{fit}^{2}\left(r^{(fit)}\right)\right\rangle_{\theta}=f \left(\sigma(r_{4}),\left\langle\theta\right\rangle\right). \tag{10}\]

This approximation may limit the accuracy of the method. However, note that the variance of the measured residuals can be divided into several terms, each corresponding to a particular angle of incidence \(\theta_{k}\) (\(k=1,..,N_{\theta_{k}}\)):

\[\left\langle Var\left(r_{4}-r_{4}^{(fit)}\right)\right\rangle_{\theta}\equiv \frac{1}{N_{tracks}}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{tracks}}\left(r_{4,i}^{k}-r_{4,i}^{ (fit)}\right)^{2}\]

\[=\frac{1}{N_{tracks}}\left[\sum\limits_{k}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{k}}\left(r_{4,i}^{k}-r_{true}^{k}\right)^{2}+\sum\limits_{k}\sum\limits_{i=1}^{N_{k}}\left( r_{4,1}^{k,(fit)}-r_{true}\right)^{2}\right],\]

if \(r_{4}\) and \(r_{4}^{(fit)}\) are not correlated, which is true since \(r_{4}\) is excluded from the track fit. \(N_{k}\) is the number of muon trajectories at a given angle of incidence \(\theta_{k}\). It follows that

\[\left\langle Var\left(r_{4}-r_{4}^{(fit)}\right)\right\rangle_{\theta}=\sigma ^{2}(r_{4})+\sum\limits_{k}\frac{N_{k}}{N_{tracks}}f\left(\sigma(r_{4}), \theta_{k}\right). \tag{12}\]

Since the different angles of incidence contribute additively to the track fit variance, the accuracy of the determination of the resolution \(\sigma(r_{4})\) should be preserved.

## 6 Limitations from the Accuracy of the r(t)-Relationship

So far we have assumed that the space-to-drift-time relationship (\(r(t)\)-relationship) which relates the measured drift time \(t_{i}\) of a hit \(i\) in a given tube to the drift radius \(r(t_{i})\equiv r_{i}\) is accurately known. We now address the question of how possible systematic errors in the \(r(t)\)-relation affect the accuracy of the resolution determination. We apply the analytical method to the simulated muon tracks of \(0^{o}\) angle of incidence, using a distorted \(r(t)\)-relation:

\[r(t)\longrightarrow(r+\delta r)(t),\,\,\,\mbox{where}\,\,\,\delta r(r)=A\cdot sin (\frac{2\pi r}{R}). \tag{13}\]

The exact \(r(t)\)-relation and the altered one are shown in Figure 11a. The distortion \(\delta r(r)\) (see Figure 11b) is chosen such that the constraints at the tube center, \(r(t=0)=0\), and at the tube wall,\(r(t=t_{max})=R\), remain valid.

The measured variance \(Var\left(r-r^{(fit)}\right)\), defined as

\[Var\left(r_{4}-r_{4}^{(fit)}\right)\equiv\frac{1}{N_{tracks}}\sum_{m=1}^{N_{ tracks}}\left(r_{4,m}-r_{4}^{(fit)}\right)^{2} \tag{14}\]

is affected by the systematic error \(\delta r(r)\) according to

\[Var\left(r_{4}-r_{4}^{(fit)}\right)^{\prime}=\frac{1}{N_{tracks} }\sum_{m=1}^{N_{tracks}}\left[\left(r_{4,m}+\delta r(r_{4,m})\right)-\left(r_ {4}^{fit}+\delta r(r_{4}^{fit})\right)\right]^{2}\] \[=Var\left(r_{4}-r_{4}^{(fit)}\right)\left[1+2\left(\frac{d( \delta r)}{dr}\right)_{r_{4}}+\left(\frac{d(\delta r)}{dr}\right)_{r_{4}}^{2} \right]. \tag{15}\]

Thus, the difference between the measured resolution \(\sigma_{fit}\) and the true resolution \(\sigma\) is related to the the slope of the function \(\delta r(r)\). The result of the Monte Carlo study shown in Figure 12 confirms this prediction. At the radii \(r\)=4 mm and \(r\)=11 mm where \(\frac{d(\delta r)}{dr}=0\) the measured and the true resolution coincide.

Figure 11: a) The exact space-to-drift-time relation \(r(t)\) and the altered relation \((r+\delta r)(t)\) with the systematic distortion \(\delta r(r)\) with amplitude A=0.5 mm given in b).

The average difference \(\langle|\sigma_{fit}-\sigma|\rangle\) is shown in Figure 13 for different amplitudes \(A\) of the distortion. For \(A<250\)\(\mu\)m, the accuracy of the resolution determination is comparable to the one achieved with the exact \(r(t)\)-relationship. With the expected initial accuracy of the \(r(t)\)-relationship of approximately 100 \(\mu\)m the resolution curve can be determined with an accuracy of better than 10 \(\mu\)m.

Conclusions

We tested the performance of two methods for the determination of the spatial drift-tube resolution using the muon tracks recorded in MDT chambers during the operation of the ATLAS detector. The conventional iterative procedure is shown to be sensitive to the accuracy of the initial estimate of the resolution curve, particularly in case of 6-layer chambers where the number of tracking points is smaller compared to the 8-layer chambers. Solution to this is provided by the analytical method which uses the exact analytical expression for the track fit variance to compute the drift-tube resolution.

In case of straight muon tracks both methods provide the resolution curve with an accuracy of 5 \(\mu\)m using a sample of 2000 tracks. The accuracy depends neither on the angle of incidence of the muon trajectory on the chamber, nor on the presence of the \(\gamma\)-irradiation in the ATLAS cavern.

In case of curved muon trajectories the iterative method does not converge. The analytical approach, on the other hand, provides the final result in one iteration step, with an accuracy only slightly worse than for the case of straight tracks.

The systematic errors in the space-to-drift-time relationship affect the accuracy of the resolution measurement. However, with the expected initial accuracy of the \(r(t)\)-relationship of 100 \(\mu\)m and with a sample of 2000 muon tracks, the accuracy of the resolution measurement remains within 10 \(\mu\)m.
