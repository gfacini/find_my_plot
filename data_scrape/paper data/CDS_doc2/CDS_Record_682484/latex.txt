###### Abstract

Between \(m_{H^{0}}=130\) GeV and \(m_{H^{0}}=180\) GeV, the search for the Higgs boson at the LHC relies on the \(H^{0}\to ZZ^{\star}\to 4l\) channel.

A large amount of work has already been done to understand the ATLAS capability to look for the Higgs in this mass window [1], [2]. But some complementary analysis were necessary to understand the signal reconstruction using both the calorimeter and the inner detector, and to investigate with a full detector simulation the reducible background rejections with the aim to reduce the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Zb\overline{b}\) backgrounds below 10% of the irreducible one (\(ZZ^{\star}/\gamma^{\star}\)). To achieve such a goal, it is necessary to use the isolation and the impact parameter criteria.

This note presents the recent reconstruction progress and the achievable rejections using the tracker isolation and the impact parameter. It also introduces the missing \(p_{T}\) as an extra-rejection tool against \(t\overline{t}\).

A summary of the signal search capability is made in conclusion, and it is shown that ATLAS can look for the \(H^{0}\to 4l\) process down to \(m_{H}=120\) GeV.

### Basics

In ATLAS, the search for the \(H^{0}\to ZZ^{\star}\to 4\,l\) signal requires first a set of kinematical cuts devoted to trigger the events and to reject backgrounds [1][3].

* We are looking for 2 leptons (\(4\,e^{\pm}\), \(4\mu^{\pm}\), \(2e^{\pm}2\mu^{\pm}\)) with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) to trigger the experiment.
* Two other leptons with \(p_{T}>7\) GeV are required in the same rapidity range. This cut is fixed to optimize the significance after all cuts.
* One pair of opposite signs leptons with \(m_{l+l-}=m_{12}=m_{\,Z}\pm 6\) GeV. This cut rejects a large part of the \(t\overline{t}\) background. Its optimisation will be discussed in the last section.
* Finally the mass of the two remaining leptons must be above 20 GeV. This last cut reduces the contributions from cascades decays from the \(Zb\bar{b}\) background, and the contributions from the \(\gamma^{\star}\) pole to the irreducible \(ZZ^{\star}\) background. Its value will be also discussed in the last section.

As this selection is not sufficient to reduce the reducible backgrounds below both the signal and the irreducible background (figure 1), we need to use the lepton isolation, the impact parameter and eventualy the missing \(p_{T}\), to obtain a good signal observability potential (\(\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}>5\)) after three years at low luminosity (\(L=3.10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\)).

### Goal

The rejections obtainable using the isolation and the impact parameter are investigated after a full detector simulation using the old DICE. The geometry is the one of the TP. It includes plates in the end-cap calorimeter, and the Morges layout with the B-layer at 6 cm from the beam in the inner detector.

A particular attention is paid to the reconstruction software. The XKALMAN[4][5] program for the inner detector, is interfaced with the standard IRECON reconstruction. It gives the possibility to reconstruct the electrons energy and angles using the electromagnetic calorimeter and the inner detector respectively. Since the muons spectrometer reconstruction code is still under developement, the muons are reconstructed only with the inner detector.

The last part presents the possibility to use the missing \(p_{T}\) as a safety cut against the \(t\overline{t}\).

## 2 Generated Samples

### Signal Sample

The signal samples have been generated [7] with PYTHIA 5.7 [8] interfaced with PHOTOS 2.0 [9] to account for inner-bremsstrahlung.

About 2500 4\(e\) and 4\(\mu\) events with \(m_{\,H^{0}}=130\) GeV have been fully simulated with the DICE program. The extrapolation of the different results to the other Higgs masses are based on particle level analysis.

### Backgrounds

To save computing time, the backgrounds are generated (and simulated) with a first selection using loose kinematic cuts.

* \(t\overline{t}\) : \(0.97.10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\) have been generated with PYTHIA 5.7 for \(m_{t}=170\) GeV. 7000 events 4\(e\), 4\(\mu\) preselected with some loose cuts (\(p_{T_{l\,epton}}>6.5\) GeV, and \(|\eta|<2.7\) and \(m_{\,Z}^{rec}=m_{\,Z}\pm 15\) GeV) have been simulated with DICE.
* \(Zb\overline{b}\)[10] : Since the \(Zb\overline{b}\) process in PYTHIA is not usable due to an inappropriate description of the phase space, the generation uses the exact \(gg\to Zb\overline{b}\) matrix element interfaced with JETSET [6].
* \(ZZ^{\star}/\gamma^{\star}\) : \(6.2\)\(pb^{-1}\) generated with PYTHIA 5.7. with 4\(e\), 4\(\mu\), 2\(e\)2\(\mu\) decay modes. The cross sections are increased by a factor 1.3 to account for the \(gg\to ZZ^{\star}\) contribution [11][12].

For both \(Zb\overline{b}\) and \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds, the cascade decays are properly taken into account.

## 3 Signal reconstruction

For the inner detector reconstruction, we [13] use a global pattern recognition code by applying an optimal filtering method (XKALMAN) for both the TRT and the precision layers. In the analysis, all the tracks with \(p_{T}>0.5\) GeV are reconstructed within \(|\eta|<2.5\).

The calorimeter reconstruction is made with the standard IRECON program.

### \(H^{0}\to 4\mu\) : Inner detector reconstruction

The results have been obtained on a \(H^{0}\to 4\mu\) sample with \(m_{H^{0}}=130\) GeV. The hard inner bremsstrahlung photons reconstructed by the calorimeter (\(p_{T}\geq 7\) GeV), are accounted for by adding their energy to the nearest muon track (see [7]).

#### 3.1.1 Reconstruction efficiency

For \(H^{0}\to 4\mu\) events, the reconstruction efficiency \(\epsilon_{R}\) is defined as the ratio of the number of events passing the kinematical cuts after the reconstruction, over the number of events passing these cuts at particle level.

\[\epsilon_{R}=93\%=98.2^{4}\%\]

#### 3.1.2 Mass resolution

See (fig 2).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Reconstructed \(m_{4\mu}\) & \(\sigma_{M}\) & \% in \(m_{H^{0}}\pm 2\sigma\) & \% in \(m_{H^{0}}\pm 1.4\sigma\) \\ \hline
129.8 \(\pm\) 0.1 GeV & \(1.86\pm 0.1\) GeV & 90.2 & 80.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular} These results obtained with XKALMAN are compatible with the previous analysis [7]. The acceptance loss in the \(2\sigma\) mass bin (90.2 %), compared to the expectation for a gaussian distribution (95%), is mainly due to the inner bremsstrahlung. Figure 3 based on a particle level analysis shows the evolution of this mass resolution with \(m_{H}\). The resolution measured at particle level is better by 5% than the one of the full simulation.

The angular resolution on the \(\mu\) tracks are of the order of a fraction of mrad (fig 4) :

\[\sigma\phi=0.16\pm 0.03\;mr\,ad\]

\[\sigma\theta=0.46\pm 0.07\;mr\,ad\]

With such resolutions, the angular contribution to the Higgs mass reconstruction is completely negligible. A toy monte-carlo has shown that the angular resolutions start to be important for the mass reconstruction above 10 mrad, which is about two order of magnitude higher than the measured one.

### \(H^{0}\to 4e\) : Electrons reconstruction

The electron energy is reconstructed in the calorimeter using (\(\delta\eta\times\delta\phi=0.075\times 0.175=3\times 7\)) clusters. This size is a compromise between the electronics and pile-up noise, and the bremsstrahlung recovery.

No particular correction is applied to the showers in the barrel-end cap crack (\(1.425<|\eta|<1.575\)). The reconstructed energies are degraded by 50% or more, and contribute to decrease the reconstruction efficiency.

The angles are reconstructed using tracks informations. The tracks are associated with the clusters after a track-cluster matching algorithm. This algorithm associates the closest high energy cluster (\(E_{T}>6\) GeV) and high energy tracks (\(p_{T}>5\) GeV).

#### 3.2.1 Bremsstrahlung recovery with the tracker

The angular resolution is also related to the evaluation of the vertex quantities like the transverse impact parameter. To ensure the best impact parameter reconstruction, it is necessary to pay a particular attention to the bremsstrahlung recovery with the inner detector, owing a good angular resolution.

A bremsstrahlung recovery algorithm, looking for a kink on the track, is already included in XKALMAN (Electron-fit). But for the electrons final state, it is necessary to complement it. We use the brem-fit [14][15], which is a powerful complementary way to reduce the bremsstrahlung effects.

In a first approximation, the shower position on the calorimeter is not affected by the bremsstrahlung. This position is known with a precision between \(6/\sqrt{E}\) mm and \(25/\sqrt{E}\) mm in the \(\phi\) direction (\(\phi_{C}\)). This position is used to constrain the overall track fit.

The hits found by the XKALMAN fit for a track, are stored for a second fitting procedure. In this second fit, using a minimal \(\chi^{2}\) method, the \(\theta\) angle and the vertex position (Z) are kept fixed, while the program is trying to find a kink on the track, compatible with this \(\phi_{C}\) position [16].

The fit with the best \(\chi^{2}\) is retained.

Figure 5 shows the reduction of the non gaussian tails on the \(\phi\) resolution distribution, before and after the brem-fit. Without brem-fit 59% of the electrons have a reconstruction error smaller than 0.4 mrad. With the brem-fit it rises to 68%.

This procedure improves significantly the signal acceptance to the impact parameter cut (See 4.2 and Fig 14).

#### 3.2.2 Reconstruction efficiency

The reconstruction efficiency includes both the calorimeter reconstruction efficiency and the quality of the track-cluster matching.

\[\epsilon_{R}=70\%=91.5^{4}\%\]

This result is close to the TP one. It includes the loss due the electrons hitting the crack region. Without these events, the reconstruction efficiency would rise to 76%.

#### 3.2.3 Mass resolution (Low luminosity)

See (fig 6).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Reconstructed \(m_{t\mu}\) & \(\sigma_{M}\) & Events in \(m_{H^{0}}\pm 2\sigma\) \\ \hline
130.1 GeV & \(1.56\pm 0.06\) GeV & 90\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The acceptance in the mass bin has decreased since the T.P. from 93% to 90% because we accounted for inner bremsstrahlung and for events with a lepton in the crack region.

The use of the particle level angles instead of the track reconstructed angles, has no effect on the mass resolution and the acceptance in the \(m_{H^{0}}\pm 2\sigma\) mass bin rises only by about 1%. This justifies the use of the KINE angles in the previous analysis.

The reconstruction of the 4e using the tracker alone is more difficult, because of the degraded \(p_{T}\) resolution on the electrons. Using the bremsstrahlung recovery algorithm (brem-fit) and a constraint mass fit on \(m_{12}\), it leads to \(\sigma_{m_{H^{0}}}=3.9\pm 0.2\) GeV (fig 7).

## 4 Backgrounds rejections

After the kinematical cuts, a complementary rejection of the reducible backgrounds (\(t\bar{t}\), \(Zb\bar{b}\)) is necessary. To reduce them to about 10% of the irreducible one1, a factor \(R\simeq 100\) is needed for the rejection[1].

This can be achieved with the isolation, the impact parameter, and eventually the missing \(p_{T}\).

Footnote 1: This gives a safety margin on the production uncertainties

The backgrounds are simulated, reconstructed and analysed in the same way as the signal.

Before applying isolation, impact parameter or missing \(p_{T}\) criteria, the samples are selected with the final kinematical cuts to suppress any correlation effect. But, to increase the statistics, the cut on the two lepton reconstructed mass pointing to \(m_{Z}\), is relaxed from \(m_{Z}\pm 6\) GeV to \(m_{Z}\pm 15\) GeV. Relaxing the cut doesn't affect the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Zb\overline{b}\) rejection.

### Tracker Isolation

In the \(Zb\overline{b}\) and the \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds, the leptons tend to be non isolated, due to the presence of b-decay products in the neighbouring of the leptons.

In the tracker isolation, a lepton is considered as isolated when there is no charged track above a given \(p_{T}\) threshold \(p_{T_{max}}\), in a cone of radius \(R=\sqrt{\delta\eta^{2}+\delta\phi^{2}}=0.2\) around its own track (fig 8).

Other criteria as the sum of the momentum in the cone or the total number of charged tracks in the neighbouring of the lepton have been investigated, without any improvement with respect to the first one.

Requiring two or three simultaneous isolated leptons is not sufficient. The rejection against the \(t\overline{t}\) is only \(R=25\pm 3\) for a signal efficiency of 85% when asking for only three isolated leptons.

Finally, 4 isolated leptons are required.

#### 4.1.1 Isolation performance (\(H^{0}\to 4\mu\))

The analysis is made for \(m_{H^{0}}=130\) GeV. The study after full simulation is in complete agreement with the particle level one, as can be expected.

The radius of the isolation cone is R=0.2, whereas the \(p_{T_{max}}\) cuts is between 1 and GeV, and without pile-up (fig 9).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Signal efficiency & 85\% & 90\% \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\) & \(170\pm 35\) & \(110\pm 22\) \\ \(Zb\overline{b}\) & \(48\pm 18\) & \(32\pm 10\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} The larger rejection of the \(t\overline{t}\) events with respect to \(Zb\overline{b}\) is related to the harder \(p_{T}\) spectrum of the leptons and to the large fraction of events containing cascade decays leptons.

After the isolation cut, the fraction of cascade decays events is changed in a significant way :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Fraction of cascade decays & After kinematical cuts & After Isolation \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\) & 75\% & 30\% \\ \(Zb\overline{b}\) & 33\% & 10\% \\ \hline \end{tabular} A complementary study, made at particle level for \(m_{H^{0}}=170\) GeV yields the same rejections without any loss on the signal efficiency.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:9]

\[\sigma_{i\,p_{{}_{H\,L}}}=27\mu m\oplus\frac{220}{p_{t}\sqrt{sin(\theta)}}\]

The loss at high luminosity is due to the removal of the B-layer2.

Footnote 2: The possibility to maintain the B-layer at high luminosity in ATLAS is presently considered

#### 4.2.1 Rejection for \(H^{0}\to 4\mu,4e^{\,\pm}\)

At the LHC, the beam has a transverse spread (\(\sigma_{X,Y}=14\ \mu m\)). It induces a loss on the impact parameter resolution. Without any beam spread the impact parameter resolution for \(H^{0}\to 4\mu\) would be \(\sigma=19\pm 0.5\mu m\) (fig 12). When including this beam spread, it becomes \(\sigma=25\pm 0.5\ \mu m\) (fig 13).

For the electrons, the external bremsstrahlung and the inner bremsstrahlung are responsible for large tails on this distribution (fig 12), but the use of the brem-fit method described above, recovers a part of these tails (fig 14). For muons, the small fraction of tails is due to the inner-bremsstrahlung.

The impact of the beam spread on the background rejection is shown in figure 15. The dotted lines present the rejection without any beam spread, whereas the discontinued one gives the rejection when the beam spread is turned on.

The loss of rejection due to this effect is more important for the \(t\overline{t}\) than for the \(Zb\overline{b}\), because the \(Zb\overline{b}\) rejection is already saturated by a worse reconstruction due to the lower \(p_{T}\) of the leptons (multiple scattering).

To compensate the loss due to the beam spread, we have introduced the following algorithm :

The leptons tracks are considered two by two and their 6 intersection points reconstructed in the transverse plane.

\[(x_{ij},y_{ij})=Track_{i}\cap Track_{j}\]

For the Higgs, these points are close from each other, whereas for the \(t\overline{t}\) or \(Zb\overline{b}\) they tend to be more distant. we use simply the sum of their respective distances :

\[D_{sum}=\Sigma_{(i,\ j,\ j>i)}\sqrt{(x_{i}-x_{j})^{2}+(y_{i}-y_{j})^{2}}\]

The cut on this sum, \(D_{sum}<1.5\) allows to recover a large part of the loss (fig 15 16).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & R & \(\epsilon\) \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\) & 12.5 \(\pm 1.1\) & 90\% \\ \(Zb\overline{b}\) & 5.5 \(\pm 0.6\) & 90\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The study made for the \(H^{0}\to 4e\) shows the same rejection with a loss in efficiency of 20%. Without the use of the brem-fit algorithm, this loss would be around 30%.

#### 4.2.2 High luminosity

When going to high luminosity, the main change in the impact parameter evaluation, comes from the removal of the B-layer. The first layer is then at 13 cm from beam line and the resolution is degraded.

To look for high luminosity effects, we have made a simulation at particle level using the parametrisation of the impact parameter resolution evaluated by G. Gadomski in the TP [18].

Using this method, a loss of 40% (30%) in the rejection is measured for the \(t\overline{t}\) (\(Zb\overline{b}\)) when going to high luminosity. This loss comes mostly from the B-layer removal, the contribution from extra-activity in the tracker is small.

### Combined rejections

The isolation change slightly the momentum distribution of the leptons and modifies the proportion of cascade decays events for the backgrounds.

This change may affect the capability to use the IP to reject the backgrounds.

In this section, the isolation and the impact parameter are applied at the same time to evaluate the correlation between the two approaches.

Since the combined rejection is of the order of 1000 for the \(t\overline{t}\) and 100 for the \(Zb\overline{b}\), the results will be affected by the low statistics.

#### 4.3.1 Signal

No effect is seen on the signal efficiency (\(\epsilon\)) when applying the isolation and the impact parameter cut simultaneously.

\[(\epsilon_{iso}\times\epsilon_{IP})<\epsilon_{(I\,so+I\,p)}<1.1\times(\epsilon_ {iso}\times\epsilon_{IP})\]

#### 4.3.2 Backgrounds

Let's define :

* \(R_{iso}\) : Rejection obtained with the isolation only.
* \(R_{IP}\) : Rejection obtained with the impact parameter
* \(R_{tot}\) : Rejection obtained when applying both IP and isolation.

If there is a correlation between the isolation and the impact parameter then :

\[\frac{R_{tot}}{R_{isol}\times R_{ip}}<1\]

Figure 17 shows that for the \(t\bar{t}\) the loss of rejection is lower than 10%, and that for the \(Zb\bar{b}\) it is about 40%.

For the same region mentioned before, after isolation cut the \(p_{T}\) of the leptons from b are in the region where multiple-scattering dominates. This is not the case for \(t\bar{t}\). If we note \(p_{T}^{min}\) the lowest transverse momentum among the four leptons, its mean value is \(<p_{T}^{min}>\simeq 8\) GeV for \(Zb\bar{b}\) after isolation, whereas it is \(<p_{T}^{min}>\simeq 15\) GeV for \(t\bar{t}\).

#### 4.3.3 Total rejection, and implication on the \(H^{0}\to 4l\) analysis

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(m_{\,H^{0}}=130\) & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Muons} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Electrons} \\ \hline \hline Iso + IP & Low lumi. & High Lumi & Low Lumi & High Lumi \\ \hline Sign al & 81\% & 58\% & 57\% & 47\% \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & 1200 \(\pm\) 350 & 810 \(\pm\) 200 & 1200 \(\pm\) 350 & 810 \(\pm\) 200 \\ \hline \(Zbb\) & 105 \(\pm\) 50 & 94 \(\pm\) 50 & 132 \(\pm\) 80 & 47 \(\pm\) 20 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

With such rejections, the \(t\bar{t}\) and the \(Zb\bar{b}\) are reduced well below the irreducible background. After the complete analysis, the \(t\bar{t}\) background is negligible with respect to the other ones. The cut on \(m_{12}\) devoted to its rejection can thus be relaxed for light Higgs masses.

\[m_{\,Z}-\Delta m_{cut}<m_{\,12}<m_{\,Z}+6\ GeV\]

It recovers a part of the off shell Z due to the kinematics (fig 18), but it implies also a loss on the Higgs mass bin acceptance. The down part of the figure 18 shows the evolution of the kinematics and mass bin acceptance depending on this cut.

The value of the cut has been optimized to improve the significance after all cuts in a \(m_{\,H}\pm 1.4\sigma\) mass bin. The values of this cuts are summarized in the table 1.

At the same time, the \(m_{34}\) cut has been optimized to account for the variation of the mean \(Z^{\star}\) mass with \(m_{\,H}\), for the signal and the irreducible background. The values of the cut on \(m_{34}\) are also shown in table 1.

#### 4.3.4 Signal observability

These results are used to evaluate the possibility to look for the Higgs boson in ATLAS. For \(4\mu^{\pm}\) final state, according to the TP, we use a reconstruction efficiency which is 67%. It accounts for the 91% reconstruction efficiency of the inner detector, but also for the muon identification efficiency (including muon spectrometer reconstruction). The mass resolution is the one achievable when combining the tracker and muon spectrometer informations (i.e. 1.6 GeV for \(m_{\,H}=130\) GeV).

For electrons, the 70% efficiency used is close to the canonical (0.9\({}^{4}\)) efficiency expected for 4 electrons identification and reconstruction in ATLAS.

For \(m_{\,H}=130\) GeV, compared to the previous analysis, there is a 10% loss in efficiency due to the inner bremsstrahlung. It is compensated by a better acceptance to the relaxed \(m_{\,12}\) cut. The reconstruction efficiencies are confirmed (\(\simeq 70\%\)). The reducible background rejection is enhanced compared to the previous analysis made with limited statistics. The signal acceptance to the isolation and impact parameter cut has been improved by 5% at low luminoisty (using tracks) and by 15% at high luminosity.

So at low luminosity, this should yield to results close to the TP. But at high luminosity, one may hope to gain 30% of signal yield.

The number of events is calculated for 3 years of the LHC at low luminosity, and 1 year at high luminosity. The significances are calculated using \(\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}\) in a \(m_{\,H}\pm 1.4\sigma\) mass bin (table 2). This method is based on a gaussian approximation. The "\(n\sigma\) poisson" line in the table, indicates the probability that the background rises to the (background+signal) level according to a Poisson probability.

Figure 19 shows the significance obtainable for Higgs masses going from \(m_{\,H}=120\) GeV to \(m_{\,H}=180\) GeV.

The line below the main curve, shows the significance for a pessimistic set of situations :

* The signal cross-section decreases by 10%.
* The backgrounds cross-section increases by 10%.

\end{table}
Table 2: Number of signal and background events and significance for 3 years at low luminosity or 1 year at high luminosity.

* The signal efficiency decreases by 10%.
* The reducible backgrounds rejection decrease by 50%.

These conditions account for a detector potential inefficiency, for the uncertainties on the production process (structure functions), and for the statistical errors on the combined isolation impact-parameter rejection.

Despite this, we can conclude to the signal observability with large safety margins in the mass range going from 130 GeV to 180 GeV. The previous analysis made for the technical proposal are thus confirmed using more complete simulation and a complete investigation of the tracker isolation and the impact parameter rejections.

Moreover, at high luminosity it could be possible to look for the Higgs in this channel down to 120 GeV after two years at high luminosity (\(2.10^{5}pb^{-1}\)).

## 5 Missing \(p_{T}\)

To complete this analysis, we just mention the possibility to use the missing \(p_{T}\) to reject the reducible backgrounds.

Because of the neutrino emission in the \(W^{\pm}\) decay the \(t\bar{t}\) events have a large missing \(p_{T}\) (\(p_{T_{miss}}\)). On the contrary, in the \(H^{0}\to 4l\) channel, this phenomenum doesn't occur. In an intermediate way, the \(Zb\bar{b}\) may present some missing \(p_{T}\) due to the semi-leptonic decay of the b (fig 20).

#### 5.0.5 Analysis

This property is evaluated at particle level using two methods :

* The \(p_{T_{miss}}\) is evaluated with ATLFAST [20].
* An independant analysis evaluates the transverse missing momentum components (\(p_{x}^{miss},p_{y}^{miss}\)) : \[p_{x}^{miss} =\Sigma_{i}p_{x}^{i}\] \[p_{y}^{miss} =\Sigma_{i}p_{y}^{i}\] It accounts for all the particles within \(|\eta|<5\) excluding the neutrinos.

These variables are then smeared according to the parametrisation evaluated in [21] :

\[\sigma_{p_{x}^{miss},\ p_{y}^{miss}}=0.46\times\sqrt{\Sigma E_{T}}\ GeV\]\(\Sigma E_{T}\) is the total energy deposited on the calorimeters. Finally the missing \(p_{T}\) is calculated using \((p_{x}^{miss},p_{y}^{miss})\).

\[p_{T_{miss}}=\sqrt{(p_{x}^{m_{i}\,s})^{2}+(p_{y}^{m_{i}\,s})^{2}}\]

#### 5.0.6 Results

The two methods described above give compatible results :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & R & \(\epsilon\) \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & 12 & 90\% \\ \hline \(Zbb\) & 2 & 90\% \\ \hline \end{tabular} These rejections (fig 21) do not depend on the Higgs mass in the range (130-170 GeV). Moreover, the \(p_{T_{miss}}\) appears to be correlated with the isolation. The rejection of the \(t\bar{t}\) using \(p_{T_{miss}}\) appears to be better by 10% on isolated events than on non isolated ones.

This rejection is not strongly dependent on the error on the resolution parametrisation.

In conclusion this cut doesn't change the philosophy of the \(H^{0}\to 4l\) analysis with respect to the isolation and impact parameter cuts which still constitute the main part of the rejection. But it can provide a good extra-safety cut against the \(t\bar{t}\).

## 6 Conclusion

A large amount of work has been made to understand the reconstruction technics for the \(H^{0}\to 4\mu,4\,e\), using XKALMAN and IRECON.

The brem-fit method has been interfaced with this analysis to reduce succesfully the bremsstrahlung effects on the electrons reconstruction with the tracker.

For \(H^{0}\to 4\mu^{\pm}\) (\(m_{H}=130\) GeV), the obtainable resolution using only the tracker is \(\sigma\simeq 1.9\) GeV. When considering electrons, and using both the calorimeter and the tracker, it is \(\sigma\simeq 1.5\) GeV at low luminosity, and \(\sigma\simeq 1.7\) GeV at high luminosity.

The TDR analysis [22], which has been recently performed with a better description of the inner detector material, confirms these last resolutions. But, it also points out a small loss in the mass bin acceptance, due to enlarged bremsstrahlung tails in the mass distribution.

The capability to reject the reducible backgrounds has been investigated with this reconstruction software after full simulation.

The tracking isolation appears to be more powerful than expected with a rejection of 30 for the \(Zb\overline{b}\) and 100 for the \(t\overline{t}\), which is not an issue anymore. The signal efficiency is 90% at low luminosity, and falls to 65% at high luminosity.

The impact parameter is still necessary to complete these rejection for the \(Zb\overline{b}\).

It reduces the \(t\overline{t}\) by a factor 12 and the \(Zb\overline{b}\) by 5.5. Removing of the B-layer (r = 6 cm) when going to high luminosity, implies a loss of about 40% of the background rejection capability3.

Footnote 3: Particle level result

The combined rejections studied after the complete simulation, are sufficient to reduce the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Zb\overline{b}\) backgrounds well below the \(ZZ^{\star}/\gamma^{\star}\) continuum, giving large safety margins on the Higgs to four leptons discovery (\(\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}\simeq 7\) for \(m_{\,H^{0}}=130\) GeV for \(\int Ldt=3.10^{4}pb^{-1}\)).

At high luminosity, the search can be performed down to 120 GeV after two years (\(2.10^{5}pb^{-1}\)).

This analysis is reinforced by the missing \(p_{T}\) variable that can be considered as a safety cut for the reducible backgrounds rejection.
