###### Abstract

An estimate of \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency for EAGLE detector equipped with a Silicon Tracker/Vertex was made. Usefulness of such tagging in one physics case was also studied. It was shown before [1] that an ideal \(b\)-tagging can be useful for \(t\) quark mass measurement. In this work a more realistic case was studied.

## 1 Events

One of the 'top' mass measurement methods is based on multi-jet mass reconstruction. Present expectations concerning \(m_{top}\) lead to the assumption, that \(t\to Wb\) is the dominant 'top' decay process. In the case of a \(t\bar{t}\) event one of the \(W\)'s may decay to lepton and neutrino, providing a clear signature of an event (high \(p_{T}\) lepton) [1] while the other \(W\) decays to two jets. One could measure the t-quark mass by reconstructing the 3-jet invariant mass in the lepton opposite hemisphere. Two of the jets should have an invariant mass close to the mass of \(W\). The combinatorial background can be reduced further by requiring the third jet to be a \(b\) one.

\(t\bar{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\bar{b}\to l\nu q\bar{q}b\bar{b}\) (\(l=e\) or \(\mu\)) events for \(m_{top}=130\) and \(200GeV\) were generated using PYTHIA. Transverse momentum of a lepton was required to be over \(40GeV\). At least 3 reconstructed jets with \(p_{T}^{j1}>50GeV\) and \(p_{T}^{j2,j3}>40GeV\) in the hemisphere opposite to this lepton were also required.

## 2 The detector model

Magnetic field, multiple scattering and finite detector resolutions were taken into account in the simulation. The program was made with the use of pieces of code obtained from Allan Poppleton. Problems of pattern recognition and detector inefficiency were skipped. They should be included in the future work involving full GEANT simulation.

For a charged particle coming from an event generator the helix is generated. Uniform solenoidal 2T magnetic field is assumed. Every time the track crosses the layer of material it is deflected to simulate multiple scattering. The approximation used is not valid for tracks below 1GeV however, but we use only higher momenta for impact parameter observations. Every point where the track crosses an active layer is a hit. The coordinates are shifted, according to detector resolutions, and then they are all fed to the helix fitting routine. We get the'measured' values of track curvature, projected impact parameter, starting \(\varphi\), \(\theta\) and \(z\).

The detector geometry used consisted of a SITV (Silicon Tracker/Vertex), an outer tracker and a forward tracker. It was one of the geometries used for studies at some stage of an inner tracking concept evolution, nicknamed a 'hollow tracker' [2]. The schematic diagram showing the placement of tracking layers is shown in figure 1. Parameters of tracking layers are listed in a table:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline detector or other material & layers & \(\sigma_{R}[mm]\) & \(\sigma_{R\varphi}[mm]\) & \(\sigma_{z}[mm]\) & \(X/X_{0}\) \\ \hline \hline beam pipe & 1 & - & - & - & 0.3\% \\ \hline SITV & 1,2 & \(0.3/\sqrt{12}\) & 0.020 & \(60.0/\sqrt{12}\) & 0.6\% \\ (3 "super-layers") & 3..6 & \(0.3/\sqrt{12}\) & 0.020 & 1.0 & 0.6\% \\  & support & - & - & - & 1.0\% \\ \hline outer tracker & 1,2,3 & \(0.3/\sqrt{12}\) & 0.060 & \(3.0/\sqrt{12}\) & 4\% \\ \hline forward tracker & inner & 1.0 & 0.045 & \(3.0/\sqrt{12}\) & 0.6\% \\  & outer & 1.0 & 0.060 & \(3.0/\sqrt{12}\) & 0.6\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

In a Monte-Carlo program flat distribution was used assumed where \(\sigma\) is divided by \(\sqrt{12}\) in the table. Gaussian distribution of track position measurement error was assumed in other cases. Definition of forward tracker in a program was simplified, the detector model was valid for \(|\eta|<2\). For sake of this study there was no need to model the detector outside of SITV rapidity coverage.

An impact parameter resolution obtained is shown in figure 2 as a function of momentum and rapidity.

Calorimeter resolution \(\frac{\Delta E}{B}=\frac{50.0\%}{\sqrt{E}}+1\%\) was assumed for hadrons.

## 3 Results

An impact parameter distribution, resolution included, is shown in fig. 3a for \(b\) and non-\(b\) jets. A tagging procedure based on the number of tracks in a jet having an impact parameter greater than \(200\mu m\) and \(p_{T}>2\,GeV\) (other values of an impact parameter and \(p_{T}\) cuts were also tried) was used.

If a jet has more than \(n_{cut}\) tracks fulfilling the requirements it is tagged as a \(b\)-jet. By increasing \(n_{cut}\) we decrease acceptance for real \(b\) jets. Acceptance for non-\(b\) jets (fakes) falls faster with \(n_{cut}\) however. Ratio of the two acceptance versus the one concerning true \(b\)-jets is shown in figure 3b.

The other signature of \(b\)-jets [3] could also be used. It is a correlation between the measured impact parameter \(d\) and the azimuth angle. It should occur only if the tracks really come from a separated secondary vertex. The true impact parameter is correlated with \(\varphi\) while the error is not. The attempts to include the signature in this study failed however. There is too few tracks left after removal of the ones that are consistent with the primary vertex. Also the measurement error is too big probably and no difference in correlation distribution between \(b\) and non-\(b\) jets was observed. In the studies done for SSC [4] this signature was also tried but finally it was not included in the tagging algorithm, despite much more optimistic assumptions on impact parameter resolution than in our case. Multi-jet mass distributions are made with jets in hemisphere opposite to a lepton. Jet pairs

having \(|m_{jj}-m_{W}|<20GeV\) are selected. Each of the jets has to have \(p_{T}>40GeV\). The third jet, with \(p_{T}>50GeV\) is added. In case of \(b\) tagging we veto a \(b\) jet in the pair having a \(W\) mass and we require the third jet to be a \(b\) one. 3-jet mass distributions for perfect and realistic tagging, compared with no-tagging case, are shown in Fig.4 for \(m_{top}=130GeV\) and in Fig.5 for \(m_{top}=200GeV\). Number of entries corresponds to \(10^{3}pb^{-1}\) integrated luminosity (11.6 days of continuous operation at \(L=10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)).

In case of no tagging we get signal and background \((S+B)\) in the top mass peak. For ideal tagging we get all the signal and some fraction of the background not reducible by \(b\)-tagging \((S+\alpha B)\). We can estimate \(\alpha\) using a background sample outside of the peak. This enables to calculate \(S\),\(B\) and their ratio in the peak. The numbers calculated for integrated luminosity of \(10^{3}pb^{-1}\) are shown in tables:

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\(m_{top}=130GeV\)} \\ \hline  & S (x1000) & B (x1000) & S/B \\ \hline \hline no tagging & 14.2 & 13.0 & 1.1 \\ perfect tagging & 14.2 & 1.8 & 7.7 \\ \(n_{cut}=1\) & 8.8 & 2.2 & 3.9 \\ \(n_{cut}=2\) & 7.1 & 1.3 & 5.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Signal to background ratio in a peak improves by a factor 3 to 5. The quality of the \(S/B\) ratio is one of the important inputs into the study of systematic errors on the measurement of the top quark mass using its hadronic decays.
