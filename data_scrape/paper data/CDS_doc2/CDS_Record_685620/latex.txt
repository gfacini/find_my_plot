**Study of the REJECTION OF \(\pi^{0}\)'s BY A COLD PRESHOWER BEHIND THE COIL AND CRYOSTAT (DICE-A) : RAPIDITY DEPENDANCE, NOISE DEPENDANCE.**

1) Introduction

In the search for an intermediate mass Higgs decaying into 2 photons, it is essential to ensure that the apparatus can reject pairs of isolated \(\pi^{0}\)'s and decrease their rate below the \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum.

Thanks to the tests of RD3 and the celebrated study by Fayarunal, there is a good hope that this can be accomplished with the help of a preshower detector made of a converter followed by a liquid argon position detector.

For this physics channel, the good performance of the DICE A solution ( coil integrated in the calorimeter cryostat in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter) relies strongly on the fact that the material contained in the coil and the cryostat of the calorimeter correctly acts as a preshower absorber, although it is not a compact layer. Thus it seems useful to look at possible differences which could appear with respect to previous studies made with a compact absorber, in two respects : rejection at \(\eta=1.5\) with respect to \(\eta=0\), and dependance of the rejection on the noise of each cell.

2) Detector model

The model used is similar to the one of DICE-A.

The preshower detector has 2 layers each 1 cm thick. The inner one measures the phi coordinate with cells 2 mm wide, and the outer one measures the z coordinate with cells 2 mm wide. In the other coordinate, we have usually taken a cell length of 20 mm, but we have checked that the results are the same for a cell length of 80 mm.

At \(\eta=0\), in addition to the coil and cryostat,there is 5 mm of lead in front of the first layer and 1 cm in front of the second layer. At \(\eta=1.5\) there is no additional material.

The preshower is followed by a calorimeter with a \(\Delta\eta\Delta\phi\) granularity of.02x.02. made of an homogeneous lead/liquid argon mixture.

3) Analysis

We have generated samples of 50 GeV \(\eta_{\rm T}\)\(\gamma\)'s and \(\pi^{0}\)'s (each about 350 events).

For each event, the cluster is reconstructed in the calorimeter; the direction of the cluster is found by removing the S-shape both in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) ( this shape has been fitted on electron events). The accuracy in the cluster position reconstruction is compatible with the test-beam data. No cut is made on the cluster shape in the calorimeter.

Then the preshower cells in a route around the cluster direction are looked at. The best cut we have found to disentangle \(\gamma\)s and \(\pi^{0}\)s is a combination of cuts on the two following variables:

. ee = emax1 / e1 + emax2 / e2 where emax1 (2) is the energy in the highest energy cell of layer 1 (2), and e1 is the total energy in the route for layer 1 (2). ee measures the "concentration" of the shower.

. dmax = \(\surd\)( d\(\phi^{2}\) + d\(\eta\)2) where d\(\phi\) is the distance in \(\phi\) between the calorimeter cluster direction and the center of the highest energy cell of layer 1 and d\(\eta\) is the distance in \(\eta\) between the calo cluster direction and the center of the highest cell of layer 2. dmax measures the matching between the preshower and the calorimeter.

An event is rejected (tagged as a \(\pi^{0}\)) if :

there is energy in the first layer and (ee < eecut or dmax >dmaxcut)

Usually there is a range for cuts on these two variables where the rejection is optimum and stable.

4) Results.

We quote the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection factor for a 90 % efficiency on the \(\gamma\)s.

\(\eta\) = 0. no noise.

For eecut =.7 and dmaxcut =.0016 we obtain a \(\pi^{0}\) rejection of 3.9

\(\eta\) = 1.5, no noise.

For eecut =.4 and dmaxcut =.0015 we obtain a \(\pi^{0}\) rejection of 4.3

\(\eta\) = 0. with noise:

We have first added a gaussian noise of 2 MeV r.m.s to each cell ( equivalent to 1 M.LP.), and put a threshold at 6 MeV for reading the cell out. Then the rejection depends on the route taken around the calorimeter cluster direction for considering the preshower cells,

as follows :

Route 8x8 cm 4x4 cm 2x2 cm

Rejection. 3.1 3.4 2.6

For the results with noise, we thus quote the rejection using a route of 4x4 cm (optimum in all cases) The table below shows the result as a function of the noise level.

Noise Threshold Rejection

1 MeV 3 MeV 4.0

2 MeV 6 MeV 3.4

4 MeV 12 MeV 2.5\(\eta=1.5\) with noise:

Here 1 MIP for a particle coming from the vertex, is equivalent to 4 MeV

Noise. Threshold. Rejection

2 MeV 6 MeV 4.3

4 MeV 12 MeV 3.4

At \(\eta=0.\), there is the possibility to put both layers of the preshower behind the lead rather than alternating lead and detection layer as above. We have simulated a model with 12 mm of lead between the cryostat and the first detection layer. The results are given below:

Noise. Threshold. Rejection

0 MeV 0 MeV 3.7

2 MeV 6 MeV 3.7

4 MeV 12 MeV 3.4

So, as could be expected, the performance is slightly worse when there is no noise, but it is more robust to high noise values.

5) Conclusion.

The performance obtained for photon identification is comparable to the one obtained with a compact preshower absorber, even at a rapidity of 1.5. The electronics noise should be kept below 1/2 MIP( 2 MeV at \(\eta=0.\), 4 MeV at \(\eta=1.5\)) for which no effect is seen ; a decrease of the rejection power is seen for noise values from 1 MIP up.
