In the present note the analysis of electron and pion testbeam data of the hadronic endcap calorimeter is described. The data have been taken with the HEC prototype modules in September 1996. The calorimeter response and resolution are determined for data taken over a beam energy range from 20 to 200 GeV. In the pion analysis energy dependent weighting factors for the longitudinal calorimeter segments are introduced, mainly to account for high voltage problems in one segment and for longitudinal energy leakage. In order to eliminate the latter, the whole data sample has been split into three classes, depending on the starting point of the hadronic shower. All results are compared with the predictions of detailed Monte Carlo simulations.

Introduction

The prototype modules of the hadronic endcap calorimeter for ATLAS (HEC) have been tested during three testbeam periods in 1996. During a run in September four modules have been installed, which provided for the first time reasonable, albeit not sufficient coverage, to absorb hadronic showers in the energy range up to 200 GeV. Testbeam data with electrons, pions and muons have been accumulated which allow for a determination of the calorimeter response and resolution for electrons and pions as well as for a study of muon identification. In addition, scans where the impact position of the beam across the calorimeter surface has been varied, have been performed. They allow for a study of the homogeneity of the calorimeter response.

The analysis presented in this note concentrates on the determination of the calorimeter response and resolution for electrons and pions. Since there is no acceptable electronic calibration available, no calibration constants have been applied. The raw data are used to extract global calibration constants for electrons and pions. In order to improve the energy resolution for pions, five additional calibration constants, one for each longitudinal segment of the calorimeter, have been determined in the analysis, by minimizing the energy resolution.

In section 2 of the present note some experimental details are described together with the data samples used in the analysis. The analyses of electron and pion data are presented in Sections 3 and 4. A detailed comparison of the experimental data with predictions from Monte Carlo calculations is presented in Section 5.

## 2 Experimental Setup and Data Samples

### Testbeam Setup

The measurements have been performed in the H6 beam line with the calorimeter prototype installed in the H1 cryostat. In the beamline trigger counters, multi wire proportional chambers and Cherenkov detectors have been installed. They provide the trigger information, particle impact point position and some particle identification. Details can be found in Ref. [1]. The hadronic endcap prototype calorimeter consists of two modules, a so called Russian module or module A, and a Canadian/American module, which is sometimes also called module B. The coordinate system and the numbering scheme of the calorimeter cells and the corresponding ADC channels are described in detail in Ref. [2]. The same conventions have been used throughout the present analysis. In appendix A a schematic view of the calorimeter front face with its cell structure and the ADC channel numbers is given. In depth the calorimeter is subdivided into five segments, each having the same thickness. The total thickness of the calorimeter corresponds to 7.3 hadronic interaction lengths. Each segment has eight liquid argon gaps with an EST readout scheme as described in Ref. [3]. Each gap is subdivided into four subgaps which have a separate high voltage supply. Two out of these four subgaps in the third longitudinal segment of the Russian module had to be disconnected from the high voltage during the runs.

### Data Samples

The data accumulated in September 1996 contain two pion energy scans with pion energies in the range between 20 and 200 GeV at two different impact positions in pads 9 and 90. These data together with the corresponding electron runs have been analyzed. Details on the run numbers, impact positions, nominal beam energies are listed in Table 1.

Starting from the raw data, those events for which the random trigger bit was set have been used for the determination of the pedestals. For each readout channel the mean value and the r.m.s. value of the distribution of ADC counts in those random trigger events have been determined, stored and used to compute the pedestal corrected energies for real events. Mean values in the order of 180 ADC counts have been found, with channel to channel variations (r.m.s. value) of about 5 ADC counts. As an example, the mean values of the pedestals are shown for run 6097 in Fig. 1a). Also the stability of the pedestals has been checked. As an example Figs. 1b-e show the stability of the pedestals for an electron energy scan (run numbers 6097 to 6101). For all readout channels the difference between the pedestal mean values as determined in run 6097 to the ones determined in each individual run is shown. During this period of five runs the variation of the pedestal mean values has been found to be within a band of one ADC count.

In order to select the events for the electron and pion analysis the following selection criteria have been applied:

* No random trigger bit
* The global trigger bit has to be available
* Trigger bits 15 (\(e,\pi,\mu\)) and.NOT.13 (\(\mu\)) for electron triggers
* The same bits were required for the pion selection. Note that the information of the Cherenkov detector (trigger bit 6) has not been used to discriminate between pions and electrons, due to the observed poor efficiency of the Cherenkov counter. This results in some electron contamination in the pion sample, which has to be dealt with. In particular for the data taken at a nominal beam energy of 20 GeV, a special electron rejection had to be performed. This is described in Section 4.

The number of events passing these cuts as well as the number of random trigger events are summarized in Table 1 for both the electron and pion runs.

Electron Analysis

For the reconstruction of the electron energy the individual energies in a cluster of five cells are summed. The shape of the cluster has been optimized in ref. [1]. The same cluster definition is used in the current analysis, which means that only energies deposited in the first two segments of the calorimeter are used, with three cells in the first and two cells in the second segment.

In order to convert the measured ADC values into calibrated energies, only one global calibration constant, \(\alpha_{em},\) is used. This calibration constant is determined from a global minimization procedure in which all events at all beam energies are taken into account.

Figure 2: Distributions of the reconstructed energies for electrons entering at cell 9 with energies of 20, 40, 60, 80 and 100 GeV. Gaussian fits are superimposed.

The function to be minimized is given by:

\[\chi^{2}:=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm run}}\sum_{j=1}^{n_{\rm run}}\frac{(\alpha_{em}\ SADC_{i,j}-E_{0}^{i})^{2}}{\sigma_{i}^{2}},\]

where \(SADC_{i,j}\) corresponds to the sum of ADC counts in the selected cluster for event \(j\) in run \(i\), \(E_{0}^{i}\) is the nominal beam energy for run \(i\). The sums extend over all events in a given run and over all runs. The factors \(\sigma_{i}\) are used to assign different weights to the individual runs. They should correspond to the resolution at the given energies. Approximate values have been used in a first iteration.

For the electron energy scan in cell 9 and cell 90 respectively the global calibration constant is determined to be:

pad 9: \(\alpha_{em}=0.08384\pm 0.00002\) and pad 90: \(\alpha_{em}=0.07686\pm 0.00002\).

The error reflects the statistical precision of the fit. After applying this constant to all electron runs, the energy distributions as presented in Fig. 2 are obtained. The shapes of these distributions can be well described by Gaussians. The corresponding fits are superimposed on the figure. From the mean values and standard deviations obtained in these fits the calorimeter response and the resolution are determined.

The calorimeter response is shown in Fig. 3. The ratio between the reconstructed mean value of the energy distribution and the nominal beam energy is shown as a function of the nominal energy. A flat behaviour is found, with deviations from one which do not exceed \(\pm 0.5\%\).

In Fig. 4 the energy resolution \(\sigma/E\) is shown as a function of the nominal beam energy. The results obtained have been used to determine the usual resolution parameters of a

calorimeter. From a fit to the classical formula

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{E_{0}}}\oplus\beta\oplus\frac{\gamma}{E} \tag{1}\]

the sampling term \(\alpha\) and the constant term \(\beta\) have been determined. The noise term \(\gamma\) has been fixed to the noise value as determined from random trigger events. If in those events the ADC values in the given cluster are summed and the global calibration constant \(\alpha_{em}\) is applied, noise values of 1.68 \(\pm\) 0.04 GeV and 0.98 \(\pm\) 0.07 GeV are found for pad 9 and 90 respectively. Assuming this value for \(\gamma\), the following results are obtained for \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\):

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l} pad 9: & \(\alpha\) & = & 16.8 \(\pm\) 1.0 \% & pad 90: & \(\alpha\) & = & 20.8 \(\pm\) 0.6 \% \\  & \(\beta\) & = & 1.9 \(\pm\) 0.1 \% & \(\beta\) & = & 0.9 \(\pm\) 0.2 \% \\  & \(\mbox{cor}(\alpha,\beta)\) & = & -0.944 & \(\mbox{cor}(\alpha,\beta)\) & = & -0.892 \\ \end{tabular}

In addition, the correlation coefficient between \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) as obtained from the error matrix of the fit is given.

It should be noted that relatively large constant terms are found in the present fit. If in addition to the global constant five additional calibration constants are fitted, one for

Pion Analysis

### Electron Rejection

For the pion analysis all runs listed in Table 1 have been used. Due the the poor performance of the beam Cherenkov detector, especially the low energy pion beams shows a significant contamination of electrons. In order to reject such electron candidates in the analysis, an additional cut has been introduced. If electrons are contained in the beam, they should deposit their energy in the volume of five cells as defined in the electron analysis. In Fig. 5 the reconstructed energy in this volume is shown for the 20 GeV and 60 GeV pion data respectively. For the energy reconstruction the electromagnetic calibration constant \(\alpha_{em}\) has been used. In the case of the 20 GeV beam a clear peak structure around 20 GeV is visible, which is a clear indication of contamination background. Such an excess is not present for the higher pion energies. Therefore events with an energy in the electron cluster above 16 GeV have been rejected for the 20 GeV pion run. No such cuts had to be applied for the higher energy runs.

### Cluster Definition

Also for the reconstruction of the pion energy the individual energies of calorimeter cells belonging to a predefined cluster are summed. For the definition of the cluster a general cone algorithm is usually used. A somewhat different approach has been performed in the

Figure 5: _Reconstructed energy in the electron cluster of five cells as defined in the previous section for pion runs of a) 20 GeV and b) 60 GeV._

present analysis. All those cells in which the mean value of the distribution of ADC counts is above two are included in the cluster. The cluster cell definition has been performed for the pion energy of 100 GeV. The same cluster has been used for all other beam energies. As an example, Fig. 6 shows the distributions of ADC counts for all cells in the second calorimeter segment for the pion run with an energy of 100 GeV and impact point in pad 9. For cells which are included in the cluster the ADC distributions are shaded. In total 42 cells have been included in the cluster for the pion analysis. Details on cell numbers are given in Appendix B. It has been checked that the final results of the analysis in terms on pion resolution and pion response do not strongly depend on the exact cluster definition. Similar results are found by applying a cone algorithm.

Figure 6: _Distribution of ADC counts in calorimeter cells in the second calorimeter segment for 100 GeV pions entering pad 9. For those cells included in the pion cluster the distributions are shaded. The cell numbers (23 and 104) are given as reference for two cells in the center of the cluster._

The energy sharing between the five longitudinal segments is shown in Fig. 7, again for pions with an energy of 100 GeV. As can been seen there is a significant fraction of pions which interact only in the second or even in the third longitudinal segment. They only deposit a mip signal in the first or in the first and second longitudinal layer, which in the case of the present calorimeter cannot be distinguished from noise. Since energy leakage is a concern in the present configuration, the whole sample has been split into three different classes, depending on the starting point of the hadronic shower.

If the sum of ADC counts in the cluster in the first segment exceed the value of 60, the event is put into class 1. Class two events are characterized by having an ADC count of less than 60 in the first segment and more than 60 in the second one. Class three contains all other events. For showers starting early, i.e. in the first longitudinal segment, significantly less energy leakage is expected. The resolution and the response have been determined independently for all three classes as well as for the whole sample together.

### Weighting Factors

The calorimeter response and the energy resolution have been determined using two different weighting schemes. In a first approach only one global constant \(\alpha_{had}\) is fitted in the same way as for the electron analysis. The main difference to the electron analysis is that due to the non compensating nature of the calorimeter, the energy leakage and the high voltage problems in some gaps, the calibration coefficient \(\alpha_{had}\) is not a global constant and depends on the pion energy. If the parameter \(\alpha_{had}\) is determined individually at each energy point the results obtained in Fig. 8 are obtained. The calibration constant is found to rise with increasing pion energy. In case of no leakage and no instrumental defects the ratio between this calibration constant and the electromagnetic one \(\alpha_{em}\) is linked to the \(e/\pi\) ratio. This interpretation is however difficult in the present case given the large energy leakage and HV problems.

In order to improve the energy resolution and to obtain a more linear calorimeter response, five additional constants have been fitted on top of the global constant \(\alpha_{had}\). The energy in each longitudinal segment is weighted by an extra constant \(c_{i}\). Therefore losses due to HV problems and energy leakage should be partially corrected for. The additional parameters are taken to be energy dependent. They are determined at each energy point by minimizing the expression

\[\chi^{2}:=\sum_{j=1}^{n_{ext}:}\ \frac{(\alpha_{had}\ \left(\sum_{i=1}^{5}c_{i} A_{i,j}\right)-E_{0})^{2}}{\sigma^{2}},\]

where \(A_{i,j}\) correspond to the sum of ADC counts in the pion cluster in calorimeter segment

Figure 8: _The energy dependence of the hadronic calibration constant \(\alpha_{had}\). The calibration constant has been determined at each energy point by minimizing the pion energy resolution. The results for both sets of runs with impact point in pads 9 and 90 are given._\(i\) for event \(j\). \(E_{0}\) is the nominal beam energy and as previously \(\sigma\) is used as a normalization factor. It should roughly correspond to the energy resolution at the given energy point.

It should be noted that in the minimization the same parameter \(\alpha_{had}\) is used for all pion beam energies. It has been choosen to be the average value over all pion energies as determined in the one parameter minimization. The energy dependence is therefore transfered to the coefficients \(c_{i}\).

The results of the fits for \(c_{i}\) are presented in Figs. 9 and 10 for both set of runs, with impact point in pad 9 and pad 90. The coefficients and their energy dependence have been determined for all event classes as well as for the whole sample. The following main features are found:

* For pad 9 the coefficients \(c_{1}\) to \(c_{3}\) are found to be close to 1 and no strong energy dependence is observed. Only for the lowest energy point (20 GeV) the coefficients \(c_{3}\) is for class 1 events significantly smaller than 1. This is a reflection of the fact that hadronic showers of small energies are on average absorbed in two longitudinal layers. Since the remaining segments do only contribute to noise in this case, they are deweighted in the minimization procedure.
* This also explains the relatively strong energy dependence of the coefficients \(c_{4}\) and \(c_{5}\). At higher energies they are found to be larger than one, trying to compensate for leakage. For smaller energies they are found to be below one in order to suppress the noise contributions.
* Qualitiatively the same behaviour is found for the coefficients for pad 90. There is however a striking difference for the coefficient \(c_{3}\). Due to the known high voltage problems large values for \(c_{3}\) are found in the fit.

### Energy Resolution and Response

Using the coefficients as determined in the previous section, the reconstructed energy distributions as shown in Figs. 11 and 12 are obtained for the two set of runs. Also in this case the energy response and the corresponding resolution are obtained from the mean value and standard deviation of Gaussian fits. It should be noted that the fits have been performed in the region of \(\pm 2\sigma\) around the central value. The results for the calorimeter response are shown in Fig. 13 for both set of runs. Since there is no significant difference in the response between the various event classes, only the results for the whole event sample are shown. Due to the non compensating nature of the copper liquid argon calorimeter a non linear response is obtained, with a remaining nonuniformity in the order 10% over the pion energy range from 20 to 200 GeV. Due to the large electron backgrounds in the low energy pion beams and due to the applied electron rejection, larger systematic uncertainties must be associated to the low energy data points. Therefore the large spread between the two data samples should not be overstressed.

As in the electron case the energy resolution of the prototype calorimeter is fitted to the parametrization

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{\alpha}{\sqrt{E_{0}}}\oplus\beta\oplus\frac{\gamma}{E}. \tag{2}\]

Also in this case the noise term \(\gamma\) is not fitted. Instead the expected noise has been computed from random trigger events. Special care has been taken to include the energy dependence of the noise contribution \(\gamma(E)\). This is necessary since the coefficients \(c_{i}\) and hence the noise in GeV depends on the energy. The importance of this effect is shown in Fig.14, where the noise at the GeV scale is plotted as a function of energy for the pion data in pad 9.

The results of the fits to the resolution are presented in Figs. 15 and 16 for the two set of runs respectively. Both, the results obtained by fitting only one global parameter and the results obtained by fitting the five energy dependent parameters in addition, are shown. They are again summarized in Table 2. The following main results are found:

* The measured energy distribution functions can only be described with a relatively large sampling term in the order of 90 %. This order of magnitude is also found for the class 1 events, which should not suffer from significant longitudinal energy leakage.
* Also the constant term is found to be large, in the order of 6% for class 1 events. This term is found to be significantly larger for class 3 events due to the larger energy leakage.
* For pad 9, the results of the six parameter fit are only slightly better than the results obtained with the one parameter fit. Only in the case of class 3 events a significant improvement can be found. This is very different for pad 90, since in this case it is important to have individual correction factors for each longitudinal segment.
* No significantly different behaviour between the two modules can be found. This is once more illustrated in Fig. 17 where the energy resolution for class 1 events and for the total event sample is shown on the same plot for both, the Russian and the Canadian/American module.

The origin of the rather large resolution terms has to be clarified by Monte Carlo simulations. This is the aim of the detailed comparison presented in the next section.

Comparison to Monte Carlo Calculations

### Electron Monte Carlo

The Monte Carlo data simulated with the HEC test-beam Monte Carlo software version 1 at MPI Munich1 contain 1000 electron events at 8 energy points in the range of 20 to 200 GeV. For the simulation, the setup corresponds to the test-beam setup of the four modules of the ATLAS hadronic end-cap calorimeter prototype as they were installed in the test-beam period of September 1996. The events are simulated with an impact position of \(x_{ervo}=10.0\) cm and \(y_{table}=5.28\) cm. This corresponds to pad 90. The seen energy (in GeV) for each ADC channel is provided by the Monte Carlo.

Footnote 1: for details see _[http://iws109a2.mppmu.mpg.de/HEC/tbl.htm](http://iws109a2.mppmu.mpg.de/HEC/tbl.htm)!_

For the analysis, the same cluster definition for pad 9 and pad 90 as for the test-beam data is used. First a global calibration constant \(\alpha_{MC\_em}\) is extracted from the entire event sample in the same way as for the real data (cf. Section 3). This together with the global calibration constant of the data is then used to calculate the width of the energy smearing per longitudinal segment from the pedestal distributions of the data. A Gaussian smearing according to the obtained width is applied to the Monte Carlo events.

For the Monte Carlo electron energy scans in cell 9 and cell 90 respectively the global calibration constants are found to be

 pad 9: \(\alpha_{MC\_em}=24.275\pm 0.008\) and pad 90: \(\alpha_{MC\_em}=24.739\pm 0.007\).

The errors represent the statistical precision of the fit. After applying this constant to all MC runs, the energy distributions are fitted by a Gaussian shape. From the mean values and standard deviations of these fits the calorimeter resolution is obtained. The obtained energy response (Fig. 18) for both impact points is found to be flat with deviations from one which do not exceed \(\pm 1\%\).

In Fig. 19 the Monte Carlo energy resolution is shown as a function of the nominal beam energy for both impact points. From a fit to the classical formula (1) the sampling term \(\alpha\) and the constant term \(\beta\) are determined to be:

 pad 9: \(\alpha\) = 21.9 \(\pm\) 1.1 % pad 90: \(\alpha\) = 21.2 \(\pm\) 0.7 % \(\beta\) = 0.4 \(\pm\) 0.4 % \(\beta\) = 0.6 \(\pm\) 0.2 % \(\alpha\),\(\beta\) = -0.923 cor(\(\alpha\),\(\beta\)) = -0.882.

If, like for the data, five individual calibration constants for each cell in the ADC sum are fitted, only a slight improvement of the resolution is found:

 pad 9: \(\alpha\) = 22.5 \(\pm\) 0.4 % pad 90: \(\alpha\) = 21.5 \(\pm\) 0.7 % \(\beta\) = 0.6 \(\pm\) 0.5 % \(\beta\) = 0.6 \(\pm\) 0.3 % \(\alpha\),\(\beta\) = -0.004 cor(\(\alpha\),\(\beta\)) = -0.890.

The fit is shown by the dashed line in Fig. 19. Again large correlations between the sampling and the constant term are observed.

The noise term \(\gamma\) is fitted to be \(1.61\pm 0.06\) GeV and \(0.94\pm 0.06\) GeV for pad 9 and pad 90 respectively, which agrees within the errors with the rms value of the noise distribution of 1.68 GeV and 0.98 GeV used in the Gaussian smearing.

Finally, in Fig. 20 the Monte Carlo results are compared to the fit to the real data in the case of one global calibration constant. For pad 90 (b)) data and Monte Carlo agree well. The sampling and the constant term agree within errors. For pad 9 the Monte Carlo does not describe the resolution seen in the data. This might be an indication that in this case additional instrumental effects exist, which are not taken into account in the Monte Carlo simulation.

### Pion Monte Carlo

Three sets of Monte Carlo data simulated with the HEC test-beam Monte Carlo software version 2 at MPI Munich2 are used for comparison with the pion data at 8 energy points in the range of 20 to 200 GeV. The setup used is similar to the electron Monte Carlo (version 1) except for some additionally implemented leakage detectors to collect the kinetic energy of particles leaving the modules to the bottom, to the rear or laterally. The beam enters at an impact position corresponding to pad 90 ( \(x_{\it exp}=10.0\,\mathrm{cm}\) and \(y_{\it table}=5.28\,\mathrm{cm}\)). There are 2000 events to each energy point provided using the generators GCALOR, GHEISHA and G-FLUKA.

Footnote 2: for details see _[http://ivs109a2.mppmu.mpg.de/HEC/tb2.html_](http://ivs109a2.mppmu.mpg.de/HEC/tb2.html_)

The analysis is performed in a similar way as for the data. The seen energies in the pion cluster per longitudinal segment are summed, where for segment 3 the Canadian/American and the Russian module are summed separately. In addition the four different contributions to the leakage energy are summed.

In order to obtain a more realistic behavior the known defects in the third Russian segment are accounted for by applying appropriate down-scaling factors to the seen energies in the ideal Monte Carlo simulation. In detail the following effects are included (compare to [5]):

Figure 18: _Monte Carlo electron energy response of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter. The response for the two impact points at pad 9 and pad 90 is shown._

* Two subgaps out of four were disconnected from the HV source,
* one sensitive pad in the second gap of channel 118 was disconnected,
* one sensitive pad in the third gap of channel 120 was disconnected and
* only one subgap (out of 4) in the sixth gap was operable.

In the analysis, first a global scaling factor \(\alpha^{\prime}\) is extracted from the 100 GeV data set to transform the seen energy scale in the Monte Carlo to the ADC scale in the real data. This allows to include noise from the measured ADC pedestal distributions and to perform the same analysis procedure as for the real data. The longitudinal energy sharing is well reproduced in the Monte Carlo. As an example, in Figs. 21 and 22 the energy distributions for pions entering pad 9 and pad 90 are shown, respectively. The distributions predicted by the GCALOR model in the Monte Carlo are compared to the ones obtained in the real data. In general good agreement is found. In particular also the differences in the energy distributions in the third longitudinal layer between pad 9 and pad 90 are clearly visible and well reproduced in the Monte Carlo simulation.

The energy resolution is shown for both impact points ( a) pad 9, b) pad 90) as a function of the nominal beam energy. Two fits with one and five global calibrations constants respectively to the formula (1) are superimposed._

As for the real data individual coefficients \(c_{i}\) for each longitudinal segment are determined at each energy point. The resolution curves obtained by fitting the parameterization (1) are shown in Figs. 23 and 24 for the three different hadronic shower models for pions entering the calorimeter in pad 9 and pad 90 respectivly. For comparison the resolution per energy point obtained from the test-beam data is superimposed. The best agreement between data and Monte Carlo is found for the GCALOR model. In particular for events in class 1 the agreement is very good. As observed in previous analyses[4], the G-FLUKA model predicts a resolution which is better than the one observed in the data. The opposite is true for the GEISHA model. It should be mentioned that the fits for class 3 events in the Monte Carlo suffer from large errors due to the small Monte Carlo statistics.

Finally, the leakage energies seen in the Monte Carlo have been included in the energy reconstruction in order to understand the origin of the large constant term. These energies have been added event by event with an additional weighting factor \(c_{eak}\) to the energy sum. The results are shown in Fig. 27 together with the results obtained for the real data.

data and for the standard GCALOR model for the total event sample. A significant improvement in the energy resolution is found over the entire energy range considered. This indicates that the low energy pions are also affected by lateral leakage and leakage through the bottom of the calorimeter in such a way that the resolution is significantly degraded. Including the leakage contributions the resolution can be parametrized with a sampling term of \(72.1\pm 3.1\%\) and a constant term of \(3.2\pm 0.6\%\). It is worth noting that similar resolution values are found for all three event classes. Although these numbers are a bit optimistic since sampling fluctuations are not taken into account for the leakage energies, they provide some hope that by using proper weighting techniques the resolution required for the hadronic calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment might be reached.

All results obtained for the resolution parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) from the fits to the various Monte Carlo samples are summarized in Table 3.

Summary

An analysis of electron and pion testbeam data of the hadronic endcap calorimeter has been performed.

For electrons the results found on the calorimeter response and on the resolution agree well with the expectations from Monte Carlo simulations for pad 90. The sampling term is found to be in the order of 21% with a constant term in the order of 1.0%.

For pions a sampling term in the order of 90% with a constant term in the order of 6% has been found. These rather large values mainly result from lateral and longitudinal energy leakage. Instrumental defects like high voltage problems have been corrected for by using energy dependent weighting factors for the individual longitudinal segments of the calorimeter. The results obtained on the energy resolution are well described by predictions of the GCALOR hadronic shower model. The other models tend to give too optimistic (G-FLUKA) or too pessimistic (GEISHA) values.

It has been shown, that if the leakage energies are taken into account on an event by event basis, the resolution can be significantly improved. In this case a sampling term around 70% with a constant term of 3% is found for the GCALOR model.

It should be noted, that the results presented in the present note are also in reasonable agreement with the results obtained in independent analyses in different laboratories [5],[6].
