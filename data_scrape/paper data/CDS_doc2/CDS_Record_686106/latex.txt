Introduction

To achieve an energy resolution with a constant term of less than 1% the mechanics of the detector have to be controlled to match strict tolerances. In particular, the average separation between two adjacent absorber plates should be controlled to be within \(\pm 50\mu\)m of the nominal value[1].

A possible method of measuring the uniformity of the gap, even after assembly of the entire ATLAS detector, is provided by measuring the capacitance between the readout pad of the kapton sheets and the two surrounding absorber plates.

In this note we describe a measurement of the capacitance of about 720 channels available in the replica of the 2 m long prototype located at ORSAY.

In reference[1, Fig.4] a drop of the capacitance of the gap between modules was reported, implying a wider gap at the transition between modules. This opening could have been caused by the different deformation that the gravitational sagging would cause in the two absorbers at the transition. In this note we measure the average capacitance of 8 gaps with the absorbers in a vertical or in a horizontal position, including one gap in the transition between the 2 modules1.

## 2 Method

The replica available at ORSAY consists of two modules of 16 layers each, stacked above a rotating platform which permits to orient the absorbers horizontally or vertically.

There are 8 layers equipped with kapton electrodes begining at the transition between the two modules.

The measurement was realized with a Hewlett Packard impedance analyzer, model 4192A. The instrument has 4 terminals which are connected as shown in Fig. 1. The non-negligible capacitance between the absorbers and the outer layer of the coaxial cable makes unstable the alternative connection with the L inputs connected to the absorbers. This connection together with the absorber-coaxial capacitance provide a loop which introduces noise into the "I" measurement shown.

The frequency of the sinusoidal generator is set to 100 KHz. At this value the modulo of the impedance of the expected capacitance (\(\sim 100\) pf) is \(\sim 16\)K\(\Omega\), at lower values of the frequency the resistive part of the impedance is not negligible.

### Validation

Several checks were made in order to validate the readings obtained. One of them consisted in checking that the appropiate \(\eta\) dependence (see appendix A) was observed for each layer.

In Figs. 2 through 4 we show the agreement between the fitted function and the measured values as a function of the channel number in \(\eta\). The agreement is very good for the front channels where no obvious systematic deviations are observed. The central and back samplings show deviations which seem to be systematic for each kapton. In Fig. 5 we show the deviations of the measured values from the fitted curve. It is clear that some systematic effect is affecting the capacitance measurements of the central and back samplings.

In Fig. 6 we plot all the fitted coefficients \(C_{j}\) (defined in appendix A) for the front, central and back samplings.

As explained in Appendix B, the central-back coupling is affecting the measurement. In Figs. 7 and 8 we show the resulting distributions after the corrections are applied. We can see that the RMS values have greatly diminished.

In Fig. 9 we plot the fitted coefficients \(C_{j}\) for the front and central and back samplings after coupling corrections as a function of the layer number. In Fig. 10 we plot all the fitted coefficients \(C_{j}\) for the front, central and back samplings after coupling corrections as a function of the layer number. Layer # 1 being at the gap at the transition between modules.

#### 2.1.1 Time stability

We have checked that the measurements are stable in time. In Fig. 11 we show a comparison between two measurements separated in time by one week. The plotted quantity is the percentual difference with respect to the average. We see that the deviations are in general small and tend to be negative, indicating a higher value for the later measurement.

## 3 Horizontal-Vertical Comparisons

A possible source of inhomogeneity in the response of the calorimeter arises from the deformations caused by gravity. Because groups of 16 G10 barswill be assembled into one module via tie rods, it is important to verify the behaviour of the gap at the transition between two modules under gravity.

In Figs. 12 through 14 we show the percentual change when going from the horizontal to the vertical position. The horizontal position is defined as the bottom layer being horizontal and the vertical position as the layer at the transition being vertical. The majority of the changes are positive indicating that the capacitances in the vertical position are slighty higher than in the horizontal orientation. This maybe due to the lack of constraint against a vertical displacement of the inner ring of G10. In any case, the typical change is seen to be less than 0.2% meaning a change of less than 8 \(\mu\)m [2], which is negligible to the intrinsic layer to layer variation shown in Table 7. The presence of a inner support ring in the design of the Atlas barrel calorimeter will decrease this change even further.

## 4 Conclusions

We have shown that for the electrode geometry of the 2 mt prototype, a measurement of the electrode-absorber capacitance is a useful method to determine the uniformity of the gap between layers and also changes in the distance of up to 0.1%.

We have shown that the \(\eta\) dependence of the capacitance can be modeled as proportional to the area of each electrode plus an empirical extra term. The fit allows to summarize each layer by one number, the coefficient \(C_{j}\), which should depend of properties of each layer, not of each channel. This makes it useful as a measurement of the layer to layer uniformity.

Using this procedure we have determined that the effect of gravitational sagging is negligible.

Dependence of Electrodes Area with \(\eta\)

The projectivity in pseudo-rapidity together with the longitudinal segmentation determine that the shape of one sampling is as shown in Fig. 15.

The area will then be given by \(A=(l_{1}+l_{2})/2\times(r_{2}-r_{1})\) and if we define \(\theta_{a,b}\) to be the polar angles of the lines a and b, shown in the Fig. 15 we can then write

\[l_{1} = r_{1}(\frac{1}{\tan\theta_{a}}-\frac{1}{\tan\theta_{b}})-\frac{d }{2}(\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{a}}+\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{b}})\] \[l_{2} = r_{2}(\frac{1}{\tan\theta_{a}}-\frac{1}{\tan\theta_{b}})-\frac{d }{2}(\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{a}}+\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{b}}) \tag{1}\]

with \(d\) the distance between two consecutive electrodes.

Because \(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\) are constant for each sampling, we then have

\[A\propto\frac{1}{\tan\theta_{a}}-\frac{1}{\tan\theta_{b}}+\epsilon(\frac{1}{ \sin\theta_{a}}+\frac{1}{\sin\theta_{b}}) \tag{2}\]

with \(\epsilon\equiv d/(r_{1}+r_{2})\).

By using \(\eta\equiv-\ln\tan\frac{\theta}{2}\), \(\tan\theta=2\tan\frac{\theta}{2}/(1-\tan^{2}\frac{\theta}{2})\) and \(\sin\theta=\tan\theta/\sqrt{1+\tan^{2}\theta}\) we get

\[\frac{1}{\tan\theta} = \sinh\eta\] \[\frac{1}{\sin\theta} = \cosh\eta \tag{3}\]

and thus

\[A\propto\sinh\eta_{a}-\sinh\eta_{b}-\epsilon(\cosh\eta_{a}+\cosh\eta_{b}) \tag{4}\]

for \(\eta_{a}=\eta_{b}+\Delta\eta\) we have after expanding for small \(\Delta\eta\)

\[A\propto\cosh\eta \tag{5}\]

This is a reasonable approximation for the front and central samplings but not for the back sampling.

### Effect of accordion shape

The area shown in Fig. 15 corresponds to the projection of each sampling on the central plane of the "crocodile" shown in Fig. 16, the real shape of the electrodes being a series of trapezoids connected by the shape produced by the round corners. Because these transformations leave the \(z\) dimensions unaltered, the \(\eta\) dependence described by Eq. 4 is unchanged.

### Fitted function

For each sampling, we perform a minimum \(\chi_{2}\) fit of the function

\[C(i,j) = \frac{C_{j}}{\sinh\Delta\eta-\epsilon(1+\cosh\Delta\eta)+\kappa \sqrt{\cosh\overline{\eta}_{i}}}\times \tag{6}\] \[(\sinh\eta_{i}-\sinh\eta_{i-1}-\epsilon(\cosh\eta_{i}+\cosh\eta_{ i-1})+\kappa\sqrt{\cosh\overline{\eta}_{i}})\]

where \(\eta_{i}\equiv i\times\Delta\eta\), \(\overline{\eta}_{i}\equiv(\eta_{i}+\eta_{i-1})/2\), \(i\) runs from 1 to the number of channels, and \(j\) runs over the number of layers. The normalization is such that \(C(i=1,j)=C_{j}\). We use \(\Delta\eta=0.01764\) and \(\epsilon=0.001\) (the results are very insensitive to the choice for \(\epsilon\)). Thus we are simultaneously fitting for \(C_{j}\) and \(\kappa\) over all layers.

The distance \(d\) was 1 mm in between successive channels from the same kapton, but 2 mm in between consecutive channels from two different kaptons, this results in a drop of the capacitance for these boundary electrodes. We have not fitted these.

The last term in Eq. 6 is needed in order to describe the \(\eta\) dependence of the capacitance. As shown in Fig. 17 the lack of this term produces a curve which raises too fast. A possible explanation for this term is the failure of the linear relation between the capacitance and the area due to edge effects; this deviation results in a measured capacitance which is higher than the predicted with the infinite plane approximation. Because the correction should depend on the perimeter of the region considered, we have added a term dependent on the square root of the area.

## Appendix B Central-Back Channels Decoupling

A default in the design of the kapton boards produced a significant capacitive coupling between the channels in the center and back samplings [1]. As indicated in Section 2 the central and back measurements show systematics deviations from the fitted curve. Also the values of the fitted coefficients are larger in relation to the values fitted in the front channels (Fig. 6). This points to a considerable effect of this central-back coupling.

In order to correct this problem we have measured the total central-back coupling capacitances for all three kaptons. This correction includes the accidental coupling due to the high voltage line and also the coupling due to the closeness of the electrodes. This may result in an overcorrection. In Table 1 we give the measured values for these couplings.

We correct for the couplings C-B-C as follows. If we denote as \(b,c_{1}\) and \(c_{2}\) the electrode-absorber capacitances, \(b^{\prime},c^{\prime}_{1}\) and \(c^{\prime}_{2}\) the respective measuredcapacitances and by \(k_{1},k_{2}\) the couplings we then have

\[b^{\prime} = b+\frac{k_{1}c_{1}}{k_{1}+c_{1}}+\frac{k_{2}c_{2}}{k_{2}+c_{2}}\] \[c_{1}^{\prime} = c_{1}+\frac{k_{1}(b+k_{2}c_{2}/(k_{2}+c_{2}))}{k_{1}+b+k_{2}c_{2}/ (k_{2}+c_{2})}\] \[c_{2}^{\prime} = c_{2}+\frac{k_{2}(b+k_{1}c_{1}/(k_{1}+c_{1}))}{k_{2}+b+k_{1}c_{1}/ (k_{1}+c_{1})}\]

These equations are solved iteratively to obtain \(b,c_{1}\) and \(c_{2}\).
