###### Abstract

A level 2 track trigger has been implemented and studied in the barrel of the Cosener's House and Panel ATLAS inner detector designs. Results for electron efficiencies and jet rejections in conjunction with the calorimeter trigger are presented, and the relative merits of the two designs are considered.

## 1 Introduction

The ability to trigger on high transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) electrons is of vital importance for many of the interesting physics processes at the LHC. Electron candidates are initially selected by the level 1 calorimeter trigger, which looks for isolated electromagnetic clusters, and has an output rate of about 30 kHz, dominated by jets that have a large \(\pi^{0}\) component faking the EM cluster trigger. Some further reduction of rate can be achieved at level 2 using the full calorimeter granularity, but a reduction of a factor of approximately 100 is needed to bring the fake electron rate below that from real electrons from gauge boson and heavy quark decays. For this, the inner detector must be used.

Previous studies have shown this objective can be achieved using a silicon tracking detector at large radius (70-100 cm), searching for a high \(p_{T}\) track matched to the calorimeter cluster [1], [2]. It can also be achieved using a design with a large transition radiation tracker (TRT) [3]. The ATLAS collaboration has subsequently decided to use a mixture of precision (silicon) and continuous (TRT) tracking, and recent efforts have concentrated on trying to find the best configuration combining the two techniques.

This note addresses the problems of electron triggering in such'mixed' configurations, using the information from the silicon precision layers. The TRT information can also be used in the trigger, but due to the differing nature of the two detectors and their trigger algorithms, their information will probably be combined at the global level. The use of the TRT information in this way is beyond the scope of this note, as is the extension to the forward region using the GaAs and MSGC precision trackers.

There are two distinct electron triggers envisaged for ATLAS, and their requirements are slightly different. The first is the single electron trigger, which will typically have a threshold of 40 GeV, require an efficiency of 90% and a level 2 jet rejection of around 100. This will be used, for example to trigger on \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events, with one \(\mathrm{t\to be\nu}\). The second is the pair trigger, requiring two electrons above 20 GeV, for processes such as Z and H boson decays. Having two electrons, the rejection requirement per electron is less severe, but the highest possible electron efficiency is required. Studies have so far concentrated on the more demanding single electron trigger, but some results and remarks are presented here about the lower threshold pair trigger.

## 2 Track Triggering using the Silicon Tracker

The current track trigger algorithm uses the information from 4 \(r\phi\) layers of silicon, requiring hits on the track in 3 out of 4 layers to allow for some detector inefficiencies. The algorithm works by performing combinatoric straight line fits in the \((\phi,r)\) plane, in which tracks starting from the origin become straight lines with gradient inversely proportional to their \(p_{T}\). This algorithm has been adopted in preference to the combined histogramming and least squares fitting described in [1] as implementation studies [4] have shown it to be faster in execution, as long as the detector occupancies do not become too high.

### Detector Layouts

The two detector layouts studied are as follows:

**Cosener's House Layout**: This design was the first to mix continuous and precision tracking, and is described fully in [5]. The layout is shown in figure 1, and the parameters of the silicon layers used for triggering are given in table 1. Four \(r\phi\) layers (from 30-105cm) are used in the trigger, and these layers are widely spaced with sections of TRT in between. Additionally, the use of the two \(z\) layers in the trigger was studied. The innermost silicon layers below \(r=30\)cm were included in the simulation, but their information was not included in the trigger as their function cannot be guaranteed at high luminosity.
**Panel Layout**: This simplified design places all the silicon layers inside a single continuous block of TRD, with subsequent benefits in both mechanical construction and material, and is described fully in [6]. It is shown in figure 2 and the trigger layers are listed in table 2. These layers are double sided, but only the \(r\phi\) side was used in the trigger. The other side is envisioned to be either \(z\) strips or stereo, which it may be possible to include in the trigger algorithm at a later stage. The layers are envisioned to be read out using charge division, which probably cannot be used in the trigger system, so strip widths of the _readout_ (not detector) pitch were used in the simulation (and are shown in table 2).

Both layouts were simulated using the standard ATLAS DICE software, with the LAr plate electromagnetic calorimeter ('CENT' 1) and tile hadronic calorimeter. The level 1 and 2 triggers were simulated using the ATRIG trigger package [7], which is now included in ATRECON.

### Track Trigger Performance

The performance of the track trigger in both layouts was first studied using single particles (muons and electrons), before combining it with the calorimeter trigger and looking at jet rejection. All simulations were performed with 2% dead channels distributed

Table 2: Silicon detector parameters in the Panel designrandomly over the silicon layers, but no additional electronic noise. Previous studies [1],[2] have shown that electronic noise increases the standalone track trigger rate, but in general these fake tracks do not line up with the calorimeter cluster. Adding up to 1% electronic noise gave no significant increase in the overall trigger rate, this should be compared with the real hit occupancy of 0.3-0.6%.

Figure 3 shows the trigger efficiency curves for samples of 1000 negative muons generated uniformly from 10-100 GeV in \(\mid\eta\mid<1.5\) with a longitudinal vertex spread of \(\sigma_{z}=5.6\) cm. The acceptance of the silicon layers drops off at about \(\mid\eta\mid=0.9\) in the Cosener's House layout and \(\mid\eta\mid=1.1\) for the Panel layout, so the trigger efficiency is calculated based only on events within these \(\eta\) acceptances. The three parameters shown in the plots give the 50% threshold point, threshold width (10-90%) and asymptotic efficiency.

Both layouts show a good efficient trigger above 40 GeV (the nominal threshold point), however the threshold width is considerably less in the Cosener's House layout.

Figure 3: Trigger threshold curves for single isolated muons in the two detector layouts

This is to be expected since the silicon layers are distributed over a larger radial range, making better use of the bending power of the 2 T magnetic field which gives a better silicon standalone momentum resolution.

Samples of 2000 electrons and positrons were generated in both layouts, with the same kinematics as the muons. Figure 4 (solid lines) shows the trigger efficiency curve for these single isolated electrons. As expected, bremsstrahlung losses both reduce the efficiency and smear out the threshold, as high \(p_{T}\) electrons interact in the material and lose some energy, curving with lower \(p_{T}\) in the outer part of the tracker.

Figure 4(a) shows the Cosener's House design with the trigger threshold set at 30 GeV, giving an asymptotic efficiency of 90%. The low threshold setting is required to maintain good efficiency for the nominal threshold of 40 GeV. Figure 4 (b) shows the Panel design with 32 GeV threshold, which gives an asymptotic efficiency of 94%. The Panel design has less material before the last trigger layer, and this is reflected in lower

bremsstrahlung losses and a narrower threshold--this effect more than counteracts the broader threshold due to layer positioning seen for isolated muons.

The dotted lines in figure 4 show the effect of superimposing on average 20 minimum bias events (generated with GENCL, \(\sqrt{S}=14\) TeV) onto the electrons. This additional occupancy produces some fake triggers at low electron \(p_{T}\), and this effect is worse in the Cosener's House design where the track trigger is extrapolating over a larger radial distance.

## 3 Jet Generation and Calorimeter Triggers

### Jet sample generation

To study the performance of the track triggering jet background events, samples of such events that pass the level 1 calorimeter trigger are required. Since the selection of jets passing level 1 depends on random phenomena such as the jet fragmenting with a large electromagnetic component or showering early in the electromagnetic calorimeter, the only way to produce such a sample is to generate many two-jet events and simulate them all in the detector, keeping those events which pass the calorimeter trigger. To save CPU time, an energy prefilter was applied to remove events that have insufficient energy concentration to pass the level 1 trigger.

The samples generated are listed in table 3. The generation procedure was identical to that described in detail in [1], [2]. The Cosener's House samples were generated as part of the overall ATLAS simulation of \(10^{6}\) jets [8], and contain level 1 triggers over the full rapidity range (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) whilst the Panel samples were generated 'privately' at Oxford and RAL, using an early version of the Panel tracker code1. For these events, only the barrel region of the detector was simulated (\(|\eta|<1.5\)).

Footnote 1: It was necessary to ‘freeze’ the geometry early in order to have sufficient time (2.5 months) to generate the high threshold sample. This early version of the inner detector code was only incorrect in the endcap regions, which were not used in this study.

### Level 1 Calorimeter trigger

The standard ATLAS level 1 calorimeter trigger was applied to the simulated events, looking for greater than \(35\,(15)\) GeV \(E_{T}\) for the high (low) threshold case, in a \(2\times 1\) cluster of coarse granularity trigger cells (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\)) in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Isolation was applied, requiring less than \(5\) GeV total \(E_{T}\) in the 12 surrounding electromagnetic and 16 hadronic cells behind the trigger cluster2.

Footnote 2: To keep the level 1 trigger efficiency high, the isolation requirement will probably be relaxed both for very high energy electrons (\(E_{T}>65\) GeV), and for the pair electron trigger. However, a correspondingly greater rejection will then be obtained by the level 2 calorimeter trigger, so the effect on the global level 2 rate should be negligable.

Events passing the level 1 calorimeter trigger fall into two main types, as shown in figure 5(a) (data from Panel layout simulation). In the first case, the 'leading particle'

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline Tracker & PYTHIA & Prefilter & Level 1 & Events & Events & Events pass \\ Layout & cut (GeV) & cut (GeV) & cut (GeV) & generated & simulated & T1 in barrel \\ \hline CH & 35 & 35 & 35 & 170854 & 46698 & 563 \\ CH & 17 & 17 & 15 & 100000 & 23618 & 638 \\ Panel & 35 & 35 & 35 & 133500 & 37954 & 776 \\ Panel & 17 & 17 & 15 & 51000 & 11028 & 744 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Jet event samples used for background rejection study (the particle in the RoI with the highest \(p_{T}\)) is a photon (shown as light hatching)--probably from an energetic \(\pi^{0}\), which canlook like an electron in the calorimeter. In the second case, the leading particle is a charged hadron, (shown as dark hatching), which has showered early and again faked the signature for an electron in the calorimeter. There are also a few events with a leading electron (not shown), from a heavy quark or gauge boson decay. Clearly the track trigger will be most efficient at rejecting the photon dominated events, and will not help with those containing genuine high \(p_{T}\) charged hadrons.

### Level 2 Calorimeter trigger

In order to evaluate the performance of the track trigger in conjunction with the level 2 calorimeter trigger, a'standard' calorimeter algorithm using the full transverse calorimeters (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times\)0.025) was used. Within the region of interest defined by the level 1 trigger, the transverse energy in a \(2\times 2\) cell core window was maximised. The ratios \(E_{core}/E_{inner}\) and \(E_{core}/E_{outer}\) were then calculated, where \(E_{inner}\) and \(E_{outer}\) are the transverse energies in \(4\times 4\) and \(6\times 6\) square isolation rings around the core. Cuts were made on these ratios and the core energy \(E_{core}\) as listed in table 4. Some typical distributions for electrons and jets in the Panel design are shown in figure 6.

The performance of this calorimeter trigger algorithm is slightly different for each of the two inner detector layouts, due to the different material distributions. In order

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Layout & Threshold & \(E_{core}\) (GeV) & \(E_{inner}/E_{core}\) & \(E_{outer}/E_{core}\) & Electron \(\epsilon\) & Jet \(\epsilon\) \\ \hline CH & High & \(>\) 30 & \(<\) 0.2 & \(<\) 0.1 & 97\% & 26\% \\ Panel & High & \(>\) 30 & \(<\) 0.2 & \(<\) 0.1 & 98\% & 28\% \\ CH & Low & \(>\) 10 & \(<\) 0.35 & \(<\) 0.15 & 97\% & 38\% \\ Panel & Low & \(>\) 10 & \(<\) 0.4 & \(<\) 0.2 & 97\% & 43\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Details of level 2 calorimeter trigger cuts and performance

Figure 5: High threshold events passing (a) level 1 and (b) level 2 calorimeter triggers, showing photon led (light hatching) and changed hadron dominated (dark hatching) led events

to give approximately equal electron efficiency, slightly different cuts were used for the two layouts in the low threshold trigger, as shown in table 4.

This algorithm gives a rejection of around 4:1 against jets passing the high threshold level 1 calorimeter trigger. However, the same algorithm was used in [1],[2], where it gave much better results--an efficiency for jets of only 10% with 97% electron efficiency. The previous study used a simplified homogeneous mixture calorimeter of higher granularity (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.02\times 0.02\)), which probably accounts for the difference. Little attempt has been made to 'tune' the calorimeter algorithm in the present setup, in particular no use has been made of the depth information from the longitudinal samplings. However, it has adequate performance for the present study concentrating on the comparison of tracker layouts.

Figure 5(b) shows the event distribution after applying the level 2 algorithm--as expected the calorimeter does better at removing the charged hadron dominated events

than those dominated by photons. The results for both inner detector layouts are similar.

## 4 Global Trigger Results

The performance of the 'global' trigger (using level 2 calorimeter and track triggers, and matching between them) was studied using the generated electron samples described in section 2.2 and jets described in section 3.1. Minimum bias events generated with GENCL were superimposed to simulate high luminosity running, using an average of 20 events per crossing corresponding to a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-1}\)s\({}^{-1}\).

The cuts used for each layout are summarised in table 5. The track trigger threshold was set somewhat below the nominal energy threshold to minimise the losses due to bremsstrahlung whilst not accepting too many fake triggers from lower \(p_{T}\) particles in jets. The track RMS cut was set to avoid fake triggers from random combinations of closely spaced hits. The \(\Delta\phi\) track-calorimeter matching cut was used to eliminate events with overlapping photons and charged hadrons, where the charged track does not point precisely to the calorimeter cluster.

The results of applying these trigger cuts to the various samples are shown in table 6 for the high threshold and table 7 for the low threshold, where only electrons not satisfying the higher threshold level 1 trigger were considered. To increase the electron statistics for the low threshold, an extra 500 electrons of energies 20-45 GeV and \(\eta\) |\(<\) 0.8 were generated in each layout, and included with the appropriate events from the 2000 electron samples. The results for each layout and threshold are discussed in more detail below.

### Cosener's House Design, High Threshold

With the minimum track \(p_{T}\) cut set at 20 GeV, this layout achieves a standalone track trigger efficiency of \(91.3\pm 1\)%, which rises to \(93.5\pm 1\)% with pileup. This rise can be attributed to fake tracks caused by pileup hits, which are then removed by the track-calorimeter \(\Delta\phi\) match, bringing the global efficiency to around 88%, both with and without pileup. The track trigger alone accepts 15% of the jet events, these being an approximately equal mixture of events led by genuine high \(p_{T}\) charged particles, and events with several overlapping low \(p_{T}\) particles faking a high \(p_{T}\) track. However, when pileup is included, a far higher number of fake high \(p_{T}\) tracks are found, as would be expected from the standalone efficiency curve (figure 4(a)).

The track-calorimeter match \(\Delta\phi\) and \(E_{\sigma\sigma}/p_{sl}\) distributions are shown in figure 7, for electron and jet events passing both the calorimeter and track trigger. An \(E/p\) cut removes the same events as the spatial matching \(\Delta\phi\) cut, as most of the power of the \(E/p\) cut has already been implicitly used in demanding both a high \(p_{T}\) track and calorimeter cluster consistent with a high \(p_{T}\) electron.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Layout & Threshold & Minimum & Maximum & Maximum track-calo \\  & & track \(p_{T}\) (GeV) & track RMS & match \(\Delta\phi\) (rad) \\ \hline CH & High & 20 & 2.5 & 0.03 \\ CH & Low & 10 & 3.0 & 0.04 \\ Panel & High & 32 & 2.0 & 0.02 \\ Panel & Low & 15 & 2.0 & 0.02 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 7: Track calorimeter matching for electrons and jets with pileup (Cosener’s House, high threshold)

The leading particle type and \(p_{T}\) of all events passing the global trigger are shown in figure 8. Without pileup, this rate is dominated by high \(p_{T}\) hadrons and electrons, with only 2 photon-led events (probably conversions), but adding pileup background produces a significant number of extra photons, caused by fake tracks from the silicon trigger which happen to line up with calorimeter photon cluster.

Table 6 also shows the effect of including the two \(z\) layers in the trigger. This causes a small loss in electron efficiency with pileup (\(\sim 1\%\)), and reduces the standalone track trigger rate. However, this reduction does not feed through to the global trigger rate, so it would appear the advantages of using the \(z\) layers in this way is negligible.

### Panel Design, High Threshold

The lower vulnerability of the Panel layout to bremsstrahlung allows the track trigger \(p_{T}\) cut to be set at 32 GeV, giving a standalone track trigger efficiency of \(93\pm 1.1\%\) without pileup. Addition of pileup causes the track trigger efficiency to fall slightly, showing that the extra hits are causing the algorithm to miss a few genuine tracks rather than producing lots of fakes. Requiring a track-calorimeter match produces a global electron efficiency of \(90\pm 1\%\), slightly higher than in the Cosener's House design.

The track-calorimeter match and \(E/p\) distributions are shown in figure 9. The smaller amount of material in the Panel design allows a slightly tighter \(\Delta\phi\) cut of 0.02 rather than 0.03 radians to be used.3 The leading particle type and \(p_{T}\) distributions are shown in figure 10, again the rate is dominated by real hadrons and electrons without pileup, but in this layout the increase in fake triggers due to pileup is much less severe.

Footnote 3: The width of this distribution is dominated by the position measurement from the calorimeter algorithm, so it is possible that a more optimised algorithm may allow a tighter cut to be used for electrons that do not undergo bremsstrahlung.

### Cosener's House Design, Low Threshold

For the low threshold trigger in the Cosener's House design, the \(p_{T}\) threshold was set at only 10 GeV (for an electron threshold of 20 GeV). Even so, the high level of bremsstrahlung produces a standalone track trigger efficiency of only \(87.7\pm 1.4\%\) without pileup, which rises to \(92.7\pm 1.2\%\) with pileup. As with the high threshold data, some of

these partially fake tracks are removed by the \(\Delta\phi\) cut, giving a global trigger efficiency of \(85.7\pm 1.5\%\) without pileup and \(87.5\pm 1.5\%\) with pileup. These low efficiencies are clearly unsatisfactory for a multi lepton trigger, where they will apply on each electron in the event.

The \(\Delta\phi\) and \(E/p\) distributions for events passing both calorimeter and track triggers are shown in figure 11. A relatively loose \(\Delta\phi\) cut of 0.04 was used. The \(\Delta\phi\) distribution has two peaks corresponding to electrons and positrons, but taking this into account and using a tighter \(\Delta\phi\) cut does not bring any significant advantage in jet rejection versus efficiency, nor does an \(E/p\) cut on the remaining events.

The leading particle type and \(p_{T}\) of events passing the global trigger are shown in figure 12. Without pileup, the rate is dominated by hadrons, with some photon events, about half of which have real charged pions between 5 and 10 GeV \(p_{T}\). As in the high threshold case, the addition of pileup produces many more fake track triggers, some of which happen to line up with the photons selected by the calorimeter trigger. These then dominate the global trigger rate at high luminosity.

### Panel Design, Low Threshold

For the Panel layout, the track trigger \(p_{T}\) threshold was set at 15 GeV, giving a stand-alone efficiency of \(93.7\pm 1\%\), which decreases slightly with pileup background. In this setup, the matching between track and calorimeter was of sufficient quality to require the use of a sign dependent matching cut, \(\Delta\phi=\phi_{\mathit{real}}-\phi_{\mathit{trk}}-0.01*S_{\mathit{trk}}\), where \(S_{\mathit{trk}}\) is the sign of the track as determined by the track trigger algorithm. This \(\Delta\phi\) is plotted in figure 13 for electrons and jets, and was cut at 0.02 radians. An \(E/p\) cut removes a similar number of events.

The spectrum of jet events remaining after the trigger matching cuts is shown in figure 14. As with the Cosener's House layout, there are a few photon-led events, some with 5-10 GeV charged hadrons in the region of interest. Adding pileup produces more fake tracks in photon-led events, but the effect is smaller than in the Cosener's House design, and the global trigger rate is still dominated by charged hadrons.

### Discussion

events are given, together with corresponding rates as fractions of the level 1 trigger rate (i.e. normalised by the number of level 1 triggers within the \(\eta\) acceptance of each layout). The rates are very similar for hadrons and electrons, as might be expected (the high \(p_{T}\) hadron rejection comes mainly from the calorimeter). However the rate of fake tracks (i.e. photon-led events) is a factor 2.5 times higher in the Cosener's House than the Panel layout. The hadron rate may be further reduced by an improved calorimeter algorithm. Previous studies [1],[2] have achieved a further factor of around 2 from the calorimeter, and an additional factor of 2 from the preshower trigger, but this will not help with the fake tracks. The TRT will also help to suppress the charged hadron background. Suppressing the hadrons in the Panel layout leads to approximately equal levels of signal (electrons) and background (then photon dominated), which meets the requirements for the level 2 electron trigger. However suppressing the hadrons in the Cosener's House layout will still leave a trigger rate dominated by fake tracks. This shows a clear advantage for the Panel layout--with the silicon layers behind less material, the fake track rate is less, leading to a reduction in the fake electron rate at level 2.

Trigger rates for the low threshold trigger are presented in table 9. In this case, there are far fewer genuine electrons, and the rate without pileup is dominated by charged hadrons in both layouts, which may be reduced by better calorimeter algorithms and use of the preshower. The rate due to photon-led events (fake tracks) increases in both layouts with pileup background, but the increase the Cosener's House layout is much worse, where it dominates the fake electron rate at high luminosity. In the Panel layout,

The actual rejection factor requirements for the level 2 electron pair trigger are not well studied. However, if a reduction factor of 100 in rate is desired, this requires a factor of 10 (\(\epsilon_{jet}<10\%\)) per electron candidate, if the two candidate jets fragment independently. Both layouts give this performance even with the non-optimised calorimeter trigger, the Panel layout having a slightly higher safety margin. However, the very low global electron efficiency in the Cosener's House layout (\(\epsilon_{\epsilon 20}=87\%\)) is unacceptably low for a pair trigger. The Panel layout is better at \(\epsilon_{\epsilon 20}=90\%\), but a higher efficiency is clearly desirable. This requires further study, especially in the area of the global trigger, to find the optimum way to combine the signals from both electrons in the various detectors which maintains the highest possible efficiency.

## 5 Conclusions

A study of jet rejection and electron efficiency has been performed in both the Cosener's House and Panel layouts, for the 40 GeV threshold single electron trigger and 20 GeV pair trigger. The following conclusions can be drawn:

* For the high threshold trigger, the Panel layout meets the requirements (\(\epsilon_{\epsilon 20}=90\%\)), and rejection of about 100:1 against fake electrons (the latter is achieved against fake tracks, but an improved calorimeter algorithm is necessary for the charged hadrons).
* The Cosener's House design does not meet the requirements, having a marginal electron efficiency of \(\epsilon_{\epsilon 20}=88\%\), and a jet trigger rate from fake tracks well in excess of the real electron rate.
* For the low threshold trigger, both layouts meet the jet rejection requirements, but their electron efficiencies are low. The Cosener's House design gives \(\epsilon_{\epsilon 20}=87.5\%\) whilst the Panel layout gives \(\epsilon_{\epsilon 20}=90\%\). Both are really too low for a pair trigger, but the Cosener's House design is worse.
* Therefore from the track triggering point of view, for reasons of signal efficiency and background rejection, the Panel design is favoured.

Further studies are clearly required in many areas, and can usefully use the same simulated event data that has already been described in this note:

**Calorimeter algorithms**: Better calorimeter algorithms are clearly necessary to combat the charged hadron background. In particular, use of the longitudinal information should be investigated, as should the optimal algorithm for the harder lower threshold electrons.
**Global Trigger**: The way information from the various regions of interest in the different subtriggers is combined is crucial to the performance of the trigger. In the single electron case, a simple ANDing of track and calorimeter signatures followed by spatial matching appears to be sufficient. In the pair trigger case, more sophisticated methods will need to be employed to get the necessary efficiency whilst maintaining sufficient rejection.
**Use of the TRT**: This note has not attempted to use the TRT information in the trigger.4 As a separate tracking system, it can clearly contribute, complementingthe information from the precision tracking and also possibly giving additional rejection against charged hadrons from the transition radiation signature. The TRT performance will probably be better in the Panel layout, due to it being in one continuous block with lower occupancy due to shorter straws, but this has yet to be studied in the context of electron triggering.
