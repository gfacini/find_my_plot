## 1 Introduction

The Inner Detector Review Panel has recommended that a design of the tracker using the straw tubes outside of the precision layers should be studied. Such a design would have a lower straw occupancy, but would also place more reliance on the straw precision when measuring momentum. They have formally requested feedback on such a design. It is therefore the duty of the Steering Group to organise an effort to evaluate this layout and to compare it with the existing Coseners House design. While other ideas may also be pursued, this must clearly have a high priority. The final choice of design will depend on the outcome of the studies. In order to examine a reasonable range of options quickly it is proposed that, where possible, different options should be examined in the new simulation work compared to the Coseners House design.

## 2 The Panel Layout

Figure 1 shows the Panel layout as it was presented to the Inner Detector Working Group. The straw tracker occupies the radial range above 60 cm throughout, and precision layers of silicon and MSGCs are used in the barrel and forward regions as before. The panel has not specified the granularities of any of the layers, either in r\(\phi\) or z.

## 3 Proposed Layout

The proposed layout is shown in Figure 2. It follows the panel suggestion as closely as possible, but varies a few parameters with respect to the Coseners design. The barrel length is reduced to 80 cm, in order to study the difference which this makes to the overlap region, and to reduce the straw occupancy. Compared to the Coseners design, the straw occupancy in the barrel should be reduced by \(\sim\)20%. The radial space between 105 and 115 cm has been reserved for alignment, services, a 5 cm thick moderator over the full length of the tracker, the support rails and clearance for access. The exact radial space required for these items is not yet clear, and mainly depends on engineering questions, many of which cannot be resolved until the power and cooling specifications are known.

The barrel region consists of a TRT between the radii of 62 and 105 cm, with a semiconductor tracker inside. The SCT has 5 layers at 20, 30, 40, 50 and 60 cm. They all measure both r\(\phi\) and z, apart from the 50 cm layer which only measures r\(\phi\), thus saving on material, cooling and cost. The question of which technology is best adapted for use in each layer should be addressed after the performance goals are clear. In this note it is assumed that single sided silicon can be used for all of these layers. Given the resolution required (see below), charge division would seem to be desirable in order to give a reduced density of electronics on each module.

The vertexing layers include a double-sided microstrip layer at 6 cm (as suggested by Gadomski et al) to provide the best possible vertexing at low luminosity. It is assumed that this layer will not survive at high luminosity. This layer is complemented by the high precision layer at 20 cm and a single pixel layer at 14.5 cm which is used to break any pattern recognition ambiguities in the vertexing. As the luminosity increases, the vertex region could be reconfigured to include a second pixel layer if pattern recognition proves to be a major problem, and the pixels can survive the radiation damage better than silicon.

The radiation damage for silicon is still uncertain. More measurements are needed of the effect of pions, and further work is needed on the detectors themselves to see where the limits of performance lie. The signal to noise obtainable from the front-end electronics is also a crucial unknown parameter. A signal to noise ratio of 10:1 is assumed when calculating resolutions, and it is assumed that this will limit the resolution obtainable to the readout pitch divided by 10, before accounting for alignment systematics. If all the uncertainties are taken into account, one cannot guarantee the survival of silicon detectors in this region of the tracker for 10 years. The present limit is set by the depletion voltage. It is therefore proposed to consider a design with 250\(\mu\)m thick detectors, which reducethe depletion voltage by 30%. In addition, it may be necessary to design for cold operation, below 5 degrees C. Even with these provisions, it will almost certainly be necessary to replace one or more layers after several years of operation. The cost and technical feasibility of this strategy will need to be examined. However it should be remembered that the cost of the inner layers rises with r\({}^{2}\), and the flux falls as \(1/r^{2}\). Therefore the integrated loss of silicon with time is roughly constant with radius, up to the point where the neutron damage becomes dominant. It may be more effective, from the point of view of spending profiles, to consider replacing a layer at 30 cm every 5 years, rather than to build a larger radius layer intended to survive the full lifetime of the experiment.

The resolutions suggested for each layer are presented in Table 1. In order to give a robust tracking performance, the resolutions of the layers are to be chosen so that each layer contributes to the momentum resolution in normal operation. No single layer is relied upon to measure the sagitta. This means that the performance should not drop catastrophically if a single layer fails. The figures given are rough estimates at this stage, and should be optimised during the simulation. Two numbers are given, the limit given by the readout pitch and signal to noise, and a target which should be met after including all alignment effects. For the layers from 30 cm outwards the channel count is calculated using a readout pitch of 200\(\mu\)m and a strip length of 12 cm. The 20 cm layer is assumed to have a readout pitch of 100 \(\mu\)m and a strip length of 12 cm, while the 6 cm layer is assumed to have a readout pitch of 100 \(\mu\)m and a strip length of 6 cm. Charge division is not assumed in z, and only a target is given, aiming for a \(\theta\) resolution of around 1 mrad.The z strips are all assumed to have the same area as the r\(\phi\) strips in each layer, giving a pitch of 700 \(\mu\)m and a length of 3.4 cm in the outer layers. This should give a z resolution in these layers of around 200\(\mu\)m. The targets given for the z resolution of the 20 and 6 cm layers are based on vertexing. It is assumed that a similar resolution in z and r\(\phi\) is needed to be useful: It is not clear that such a resolution can be achieved with the channel count quoted. A 10% overlap between modules is assumed throughout.

The total channel count is 1.7 Mchannels for the barrel SCT to be compared with 2.8 Mchannels for the Coseners design, not including the pixels. At 2 mW per channel, the cooling load decreases to 3.4 kW from 5.6 kW, with a corresponding reduction in cooling pipe material and power busses. The electronics cost is similarly reduced.

In the forward regions MSGCs and GaAs disks are used to give the required precision points, with the same resolution assumed as for the Coseners design, and with the same stereo layers. This may not be sufficient to give the required momentum resolution without the outer wheels, and simulation may show the resolution would need to be improved. If so, it will be necessary to consider whether any technology is available which can deliver the required performance. The number of disks used in this layout is fairly arbitrary, and appears at first sight to be more than required for the coverage. This should be optimised further using simulation. For this reason the channel count numbers have not yet been calculated for the forward region, but the reduction is clearly more than a factor of 2. The use of GaAs for the inner disks is motivated both by the expected radiation hardness, and the ability to survive the dose without requiring cold operation, which would be difficult to implement for these isolated disks. The position of the GaAs disks in z is chosen to give a high precision point close to the vertex region for vertexing at large \(\eta\). However the mechanical problems of installing the disks in this position, and of routing services around them, may require them to be moved to a larger z.

In the Panel layout, the straw coverage is reduced due to the increase in the inner radius. In the proposed layout the coverage is restored by increasing the radial range of the straws at high z. A potential disadvantage of this approach is that the occupancy of these straw modules is not reduced. compared to the Coseners design, although the first section of forward straw modules has reduced occupancy. In addition, the last four MSGC rings need to be installed in between straws, which is a major disadvantage from the mechanical point of view, since this prevents an easy access to the precision layers in the inner region, and breaks up the mechanical support of the MSGC system. This makes the task of aligning the MSGC system more difficult, as well as complicating the access and the construction of the straw and MSGC modules. This point deserves more study to see whether a better solution can be found.

## 4 Conclusions

A layout is proposed for simulation work which follows the design principles proposed by the Inner Detector Review Panel. This layout also embodies some of the suggestions made for improvements to the existing design in vertexing performance. It uses a shorter barrel in order to evaluate the effect of such a change. Detailed optimisation should be performed by simulation to test the performance of such a design.
