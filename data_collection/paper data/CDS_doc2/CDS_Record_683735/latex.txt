###### Abstract

In the following pages, one should find the basic information concerning the liquid argon pollution studies after neutron irradiation of various parts of the em calorimeter. The tests were performed at the SARA facility in Grenoble. Detailed information about this irradiation facility and about the way the pollution is measured can be found in:

For each sample, its reference and/or origin are given. The neutron fluence has been averaged over the volume of the samples. Two pieces of data are displayed on two graphs. The first one shows the evolution of the monitor response before (where it is averaged to 1.0), during and after the irradiation. The second one shows the attenuation of the monitor response due to irradiation as a function of the electric field. Error bars are purely statistical. The volume of liquid argon was between 5 and 5.5 litres. The comparison of the amount of irradiated material (area, length, number of pieces as the case may be) to the amount relevant to the calorimeter shouldallow to derive the pollution to be expected therein. The loss of signal predicted in the calorimeter must take into account the local neutron fluence worked out in the simulation (see TDR). Finally, a factor of three down must be applied to the calculated loss, due to the difference in the shaping times in SARA and ATLAS electronics.

Almost for every test, a fairly fast drop seems to show up at the very beginning of the irradiation. In some cases, the pollution does not get worse after this first drop, the attenuation is then around 1 or 2 percent. There, the observed attenuation might be due to some pollution coming from the cryostat itself and not from the samples. This is suggested by the data with no samples in the cryostat, see "EMPTY CRYOSTAT". Therefore, pollutions of one or two percent are not absolutly significant and should be interpreted as a maximum. Most of the time, the pollution is not compatible with the presence of oxygen.

## Appendix E EM Endcap epoxy

## Prepreg-2

**glued on both sides of FR4 plates.**

**origin: ISN**

**reference: CTMI 5512-1383-1808-50/110**

**total area: 0.20m\({}^{2}\)**

**date of irradiation: 21 April 1997**

**mean fluence: 2.5 10\({}^{14}\) n.cm\({}^{-2}\) (first irrad), then 0.9 10\({}^{14}\) n.cm\({}^{-2}\) (2nd irrad)**

**comments:** The main point was to check that the pollution does actually scale with the amount of irradiated material. Therefore, it has to be compared to the Prepreg-1 page.

The first picture shows the data after two irradiations. Twenty four hours after the cryostat was refilled with fresh argon, this operation was stopped when the level reached 2 litres and the alpha-cell response was measured (time=145h). The signal loss was then 3.5%. It was measured again when filling was completed and the loss was found to be 1.5%, which implies that impurities were present when refill was started. Either the impurities released after the first irradiation remained in the cryostat after the evaporation (see Prepreg-1), or some air was accidently let in during the operation. In any case, the pollution rate seems to have been the same during the second irradiation, if not larger.

Kapton electrodes, no resistive ink origin: CERN, Cicorel reference: prototype EST electrode total area: 0.86m\({}^{2}\) date of irradiation: 3 March 1998 mean fluence: 1.8 10\({}^{14}\) n.cm\({}^{-2}\) comments: no visible damage on the gluing. The calibration pulser was not perfectly stable.
