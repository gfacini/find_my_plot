A Hamamatsu PIN high resistivity n-type silicon diode was exposed to a fluence of \(0.955\times 10^{14}/\)cm\({}^{2}\) 800 MeV K.E. protons at the LAMPF accelerator in July 1991. The diode was irradiated and stored at \(\sim 0^{\circ}\)C. The diode temperature and radiation exposure are similar to what is expected for the inner layers of the ATLAS SCT. This note reports the depletion voltage measurements over 6 years. The results are in good agreement with a previous parameterization for silicon annealing based on measurements at warmer annealing temperatures.

## 1 Introduction

Bulk radiation damage to silicon sensors results in changes in the effective silicon dopant concentration, \(N_{eff}\). Changes in \(N_{eff}\) are in turn related to changes in the sensor depletion voltage. In practice the maximum operating voltage for a silicon sensor is limited, _eg_ by breakdown. Thus it is essential to make reliable predictions of sensor depletion voltages versus radiation fluence and time at the LHC [1, 2]

The changes in \(N_{eff}\) depend on the magnitude and type of radiation fluence. Time dependent changes in \(N_{eff}\) depend on the sensor temperature and on the radiation fluence. For details see Ref. [1] and references therein.

Planning for the ATLAS pixel and silicon strip tracking systems has relied on studies of silicon sensors irradiated to fluences comparable to those predicted for LHC [3, 4]. However most annealing studies have been done over short periods of time and at elevated temperatures [5-10]. Thus it is important to check that the silicon annealing parameterization applicable at temperatures well above room temperatures also apply to temperatures near the planned operating temperature, \(\sim-10^{\circ}\)C, of the ATLAS SCT.

In this note we report 6 years depletion voltage measurements of a highly irradiated Hamamatsu PIN high resistivity n-type silicon diode. The diode was irradiated and stored at \(\sim 0^{\circ}\)C.

## 2 Results

The silicon sensor reported in this note was a 1 cm\({}^{2}\) Hamam at su PIN Photodiode #S1723-04 with a 170 \(\mu\)m depletion depth [11]. The sensor was irradiated at \(\sim 0^{\circ}\)C to a fluence of \(0.955\times 10^{14}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) 800 MeV K.E. protons at the LAMPF accelerator or in July 1991. Following the irradiation the sensor was stored for one month at \(\sim 8^{\circ}\)C. For the remaining time the sensor has been at \(\sim 0^{\circ}\)C. Details on the irradiation, fluence monitoring procedures, and on the procedures to measure the silicon diode depletion voltage are reported in Ref. [1].

The sensor depletion voltage versus time is given in Fig. 1. Time zero corresponds to the beginning of the \(\sim 5\) day irradiation run. At the end of 6 years the depletion voltage is \(\sim 44\) volts. The corresponding value for a 300 \(\mu\)m sensor would be \(\sim 137\) volts. This latter value is an overestimate of the depletion voltage for a sensor with the same integral fluence at the LHC and/or maintained at temperatures \(<0^{\circ}\)C.
