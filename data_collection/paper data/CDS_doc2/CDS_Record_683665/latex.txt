**Atlas policy on radiation hard electronics**

**DRAFT**

## 1 Introduction.

The electronics installed in the ATLAS detector will be subject to high levels of radiation as described in [1].

The level of radiation at places where the front-end electronics is located in the detector is given in table 1.

It is obvious that one has to build radiation-hardened electronics. This note describes a number of available rad-hard technologies, the strategy ATLAS is planning to follow in this domain and the status of the ASICs which have been developed up to now.

## 2 Available technologies.

There are a number of technologies available, either guaranteed rad-hard or which have shown good rad-hard characteristics. In addition, there are ways to make radiation hard design with radiation soft technologies. They are described in the following section.

### At&t.

AT&T has a bipolar process which is not guaranteed rad-hard but which has exhibited sufficient radiation hard characteristics to be used in front-end application. In particular the \(\upbeta\) degradation of the transistors remains at an acceptable level and does not lead to dramatic noise performance degradation after 50 kGy and \(10^{14}\) N.cm-\({}^{2}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Detector Component & Dose & Neutron \\  & (kGy yr-1 ) & fluence \\  & & (cm-2 yr-1 ) \\ \hline Pixel & 34 & 5.9 \(10^{13}\) \\ \hline SCT Barrel & 15 & 2.7 \(10^{13}\) \\ \hline SCT Forward & 10 & 2.2 \(10^{13}\) \\ \hline TRT Barrel & 2.5 & 6.3 \(10^{12}\) \\ \hline TRT Forward & 4.7 & 1.3 \(10^{13}\) \\ \hline EM Barrel & 0.01 & 1.0 \(10^{12}\) \\ \hline Tile Barrel & 0.02 & 1.6 \(10^{12}\) \\ \hline Tile Extend. Barrel & 0.036 & 2.0 \(10^{12}\) \\ \hline Barrel/EB crack & 0.025 & 1.0 \(10^{12}\) \\ \hline EM End-cap & 0.01 & 1.0 \(10^{12}\) \\ \hline Had. End-cap & 0.03 & 3.0 \(10^{12}\) \\ \hline Forward calor. & 0.01 & 1.0 \(10^{11}\) \\ \hline Muon detec. & 0.001 & 3.0 \(10^{11}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Dmil.

DMILL is a technology which has been developed for radiation hard purposes by a French consortium (CEA, IN2P3, LETTI) and which is now being produced by Matra MHS. It is guaranteed up to 0.1 MGy and 10\({}^{14}\) N.cm\({}^{-2}\) and the following processes are available: Bipolar (NPN only), CMOS, JFET and BiCMOS.

### Harris.

Harris has a bipolar and a CMOS process guaranteed up to 5 kGy and measurements have shown that the degradation of characteristics remains tolerable up to 100 kGy.

### Honeywell.

Honeywell has a CMOS process tested up to 20 kGy and a GaAs process tested up to 2.5 MGy. A new SOI CMOS 0.65 \(\upmu\)m process tested up to 100 kGy is also available. This last one exhibits very low sensitivity to SEE.

### Maxim.

Maxim has a bipolar process which is not guaranteed rad-hard but which has exhibited sufficient radiation hard characteristics to be used in front-end application. In particular the 8 degradation of the transistors remains at an acceptable level and does not lead to dramatic noise performance degradation after 50 kGy and 10\({}^{14}\) N.cm\({}^{-2}\).

### Use of radiation soft technologies.

It could be considered to use radiation soft technologies in areas where the radiation level is moderate (Barrel calorimeter, Muons) and to make the design in such a way that there one can accept degradation of electronics components.

It is also considered to test the radiation hardness of some commercial devices that could be used in moderate radiation environment. An example is the wish to use ADC from Analog Devices for the calorimeter electronics: this bipolar non radiation hard chip has been irradiated and has shown it's still working after 10 kGy dose.

ATLAS is planning to make use of these possibilities to produce the required radiation hard electronics at a cost as low as possible.

## 3 Principles of strategy.

### Design for 2 technologies.

It has long been recognised that reliance on a single supplier of radiation hard circuits would likely result in significantly higher costs than would be available under a competitive-bidding scenario and further that this would pose an unacceptable risk for the experiment since any given vendor could choose to terminate their production capability, or to no longer give access to it to the particle physics community. For this reason, all rad-hard circuit developments within ATLAS are investigating more than one foundry and intend to fully prototype the required circuits in two different processes.

### Testing for functionality after irradiation.

A substantial set of measurements of the radiation hardness of the described processes exists. It is believed that there are at least two processes which will meet the specifications for radiation hardness for the SCT, Pixel and TRT integrated circuits. However, exhaustive tests of the performance to the maximum radiation dose do not yet exist for all processes, for the particular circuits implemented. As it has been shown that the radiation hardness of a particular design strongly depends on the way this design is done, these tests have to be carried out. This is expected to happen during the balance of 1996 and 1997.

### Design and test for reliability.

ATLAS intends to review all designs for reliability. In addition, extensive tests, involving 100-1000 integrated circuits, will be carried out after exposure to radiation, and appropriate annealing, to set lower limits on the MTBF. For these tests, which determine the quality of the process after irradiation as well as verifying robustness of design, it will be valuable to co-ordinate with other experiments and any other potential users of radiation hard circuits from the same processes.

The system design has to be done in such a way that the single event effects (SEE) do not compromise the full system.

### Use of radiation soft technologies.

For foundries that are not labelled radiation hard, but which inherently are very hard to total dose, such as bipolar processes, a series of tests will be carried out to verify that the devices are radiation-hard over many different lots. Again, it may be useful to explore the radiation hardness at the "corner parameters" of the process. It has also been noted that the ft of bipolar devices tends to be strongly correlated with radiation damage due to displacement, e.g. from neutrons and protons, and that ft is typically closely monitored as part of the process monitor. It is expected that radiation resistance to ionising radiation, for bipolar processes, will be stable if the process is maintained stable, i.e. if the basic process is not changed. More work needs to be done on this, but we note that many measurements have been carried out over 3-5 years for the Maxim and AT&T processes and these have always shown similar radiation hardness. At the moment it seems much riskier to attempt to use commercial CMOS processes for chips requiring doses above several kGy. This could change in the future with more information, but at the moment this does not appear to be necessary given the availability of several rad-hard CMOS processes.

For lower radiation environment (Calorimeter and Muon electronics), commercial off-the-shelf components are potentially vulnerable to radiation damage effects. The importance of this issue encourages us for further study in the areas of the radiation-tolerance of non-hardened sub-micron CMOS technologies, methods for the design of radiation-tolerant circuits, and procedures for the hardness screening of commercial components. Information concerning the behavior of commercial components whenirradiated, should be made available to the community. Common projects with other experiments in all these fields should be encouraged.

The following rule should be followed: "any piece of electronics which goes in a radiation environment, even low, must be tested in similar conditions before being installed".

### Define our own specifications.

Experience in space and military applications has shown it necessary to define specifications the different components have to meet. However these specifications are very demanding and lead to an increase in cost we cannot afford. We believe that we can define our own specifications in terms of radiation level expected, dose profile, temperature conditions, power supplies variations, ESD, etc... This will allow to perform the tests with a reduced list of requirements and as a consequence an increase in yield.

For instance, it is useless to require the SCT electronics to work between -50 \({}^{\circ}\)C and +125 \({}^{\circ}\)C as this electronics is running always at about 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Common work in this field must be encouraged.

### Cost of ASICs.

Present cost estimates of the integrated circuits for SCT, Pixels, and TRT are based on quotes from foundries, in particular from Honeywell, Maxim, and DMILL. These quotes are based on delivery of tested dies or on a cost/wafer with an estimated yield (the yield is usually based on both manufacturers estimates and on results of prototyping).

To obtain the best advantage in terms of bidding, it is anticipated that designs will be fully implemented and tested in two processes for each of the integrated circuits.

However, it is likely that the production contract for each chip will go to only one foundry in order to obtain the lowest costs. If the circuits have been fully prototyped in a second process, in the unlikely event that the foundry chosen for production develops problems, the contract for production could be shifted to the second foundry with relatively little delay.

### Production.

We are very aware of the fact that the situation in the radiation hard electronics sector is uncertain. This market was mainly driven by the military missile industry which dramatically decreased during the last few years. As a consequence, the number of radiation hard electronics manufacturers has also decreased (from about 20 to 4 or 5).

Despite the fact that we have been told by Harris, Honeywell and DMILL that they will maintain their radiation hard processes for at least five to ten years, we believe it useful to foresee a full production including running spares in one go.

## 4 ATLAS Asics developments.

We summarise in Table 2, the different integrated circuits for the inner detector and the vendors currently being pursued or which are likely to be pursued:

These integrated circuits in general demonstrate the basic functionality required for the system, but do not necessarily include all interface logic. For the SCT, SCT32B/SCT128B are 32 and 128 channel versions of a BiCMOS chip in DMILL which is intended to include all functionality of the CAFE and CDP128 circuits. SCT32A and SCT128A are 32 and 128 ch versions of a BiCMOS chip including bipolar amplifier and an analog memory. For the TRT system, PLL and Tern Rec refer to the phase lock loop and ternary receiver for the digital time measurement chip (DTMROC). These are the primary mixed analog/digital sections of that chip.

A few comments about the developments:

* For SCT, designs are quite advanced in AT&T, Maxim and DMILL for the bipolar chip and in both Honeywell and DMILL for Digital Chip. For the first DMILL run available from MHS (March 97) it is expected to have two full function designs for both binary and analog solutions.

\end{table}
Table 2: Summary of the required radiation hardness and current radiation tests for integrated circuits for the inner detector system.

* For pixels, extensive prototyping of circuit elements has been accomplished and designs which approach full functionality are nearing completion in DMILL and in rad-soft processes. Production designs are intended for both Honeywell and DMILL. Slightly different designs would be used for the two processes.
* For TRT, a fully functional version of the ASD has been fabricated in the MAXIM process which has been shown to be radiation hard. Several mixed analog/digital elements have been fabricated in DMILL. The full design will be migrated to DMILL in 1997. Prototyping of analog/digital elements will occur in Honeywell in 1997 with a full design expected to be submitted to Honeywell in 1998.
* For the SCT bipolar chip, the TRT bipolar chip, and the TRT Digital Time Measurement chip, it is likely that at least three foundries will be available (the bipolar and CMOS processes of Harris being additional candidates). It is less clear at this time whether there exists a viable third supplier for the SCT and Pixel CMOS chips because of the high density required.

We summarise in Table 3, the different integrated circuits for the calorimeter and the vendors currently being pursued or which are likely to be pursued:

Table 3.

Summary of the required radiation hardness and current radiation tests for integrated circuits for the calorimeter system.

* For the calorimeter electronics there is still some work needed for the design of the "glue" logic needed in the front-end crates located in the crack. Although the level of radiation at that place is moderate, the use of standard electronics may not be possible.

The muon detector electronics is subject to low levels of radiation (10 Gy and 3 10\({}^{12}\) N/cm\({}^{-2}\) for ten years of operation in the worst case [\(\eta=\pm\) 2.3]). It is believed that the use of special technologies is not required. Nonetheless all the electronics components which will be designed or used will be tested after irradiation.

A summary of the integrated circuits for the ATLAS inner tracker, the present status of development and radiation tests, and the plans for fully functional rad-hard versions is presented in Table 4.

For the calorimeter system, all electronics do not accumulate doses greater than 0.25 kGy and/or 10\({}^{13}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\). These levels are not a significant problem for bipolar technologies and a number of "rad-tolerant" CMOS processes which tolerate more than 0.6 kGy exist. Custom circuits will be fabricated using such rad-tolerant processes or truly rad-hard processes. Any commercial components utilised will be fully tested for this level of radiation resistance. A summary of the integrated circuits for the ATLAS calorimeter, the present status of development and radiation tests, and the plans for fully functional rad-hard versions is presented in Table 5.
