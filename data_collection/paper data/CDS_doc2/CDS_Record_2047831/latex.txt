## 1 Introduction

This note reports on the performance of the ATLAS muon reconstruction obtained in early 2015 data. Dimuon resonances (\(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)) are used to measure the muon reconstruction and isolation efficiencies as a function of the muon transverse momentum and pseudorapidity. The same data is also used to validate the muon momentum corrections.

## 2 Data and Monte Carlo samples

The results presented in this note are obtained from the analysis of \(pp\) collision events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 85 \(\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) collected by the ATLAS detector in June and July 2015 at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV during the 50 ns run. Events were accepted only if the Inner Detector (ID), Muon Spectrometer (MS), and the calorimeter detectors were operational, and if both the solenoid and toroid magnets were on. The online event selection was performed by a three-level trigger system described in Ref. [1]. The results presented are based on the analysis of events identified as \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays. The former were selected using a single muon trigger with a nominal transverse momentum threshold of 14 GeV. The \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events used for muon momentum studies were selected using a dimuon trigger with a nominal transverse momentum threshold on each muon of 4 GeV. For \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) efficiency studies, events were selected using a combination of single muon triggers as well as a dedicated trigger requiring a muon with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV, an ID track with \(p_{T}>3.5\) GeV, and a dimuon invariant mass compatible with a \(J/\psi\) resonance.

Monte Carlo (MC) samples for the process \(pp\to(Z/\gamma^{*})X\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}X\) were generated using POWHEG BOX [2] interfaced to PYTHIA8 [3]. The CT10 [4] parton density functions have been used. The PHOTOS [5] package has been used to simulate final state photon radiation (FSR), using the exponentiated mode that leads to multi-photon emission accounting for \(\gamma^{*}\) interference in \(Z\) decays.

The samples of prompt \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) were generated using PYTHIA8 complemented with PHOTOS to simulate the effects of final state radiation. A cut on the transverse momentum of each muon (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}>2.5\) and 4 GeV, respectively) was applied at the generator level.

The samples used for the simulation of the backgrounds to \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) are described in detail in [6]. They include \(Z\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), \(W\to\mu\nu\) and \(W\to\tau\nu\) generated with POWHEG, \(WW\), \(ZZ\), and \(WZ\) generated with SHERPA [7], \(t\bar{t}\) samples generated with MC@NLO [8], as well as \(b\bar{b}\) and \(c\bar{c}\) samples generated with PYTHIA6.

All the generated samples were passed through the simulation of the ATLAS detector based on GEANT4 [9; 10] and reconstructed with the same programs used for the data. The ID and the MS were simulated with an ideal geometry without any misalignment.

The 2012 \(pp\) collisions data at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV, as well as the corresponding simulation, have been reprocessed with the same reconstruction program developed for the new data. This high-statistics sample is used to derive the preliminary momentum corrections.

## 3 Detector description and muon reconstruction

A detailed description of the ATLAS detector can be found in reference [11]. Information from the Inner Detector, the Muon Spectrometer, and - to a lesser extent - the calorimeters, is used to identify and precisely reconstruct muons produced in the \(pp\) collisions.

The ID consists of three sub-detectors: the Silicon Pixels and the Semi-Conductor Tracker (SCT) with a pseudorapidity coverage up to 2.5, and the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) with a pseudorapidity coverage up to 2.0. The ID measures the muon track close to the interaction point (IP) providing high resolution coordinate measurements for track reconstruction inside an axial magnetic field of 2 T.

The MS is the outermost ATLAS sub-detector. It is designed to detect charged particles in the pseudorapidity region up to \(|\eta|=2.7\), and to provide momentum measurements with a relative resolution better than 3% over a wide \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range and up to 10% at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\approx 1\) TeV. The MS consists of one barrel (\(|\eta|<1.05\)) and two end-cap sections. A system of three large superconducting air-core toroidal magnets provides a magnetic field with a bending integral of about 2.5 Tm in the barrel and up to 6 Tm in the end-caps. Resistive Plate chambers (RPC, three doublet layers for \(|\eta|<1.05\)) and Thin Gap Chambers (TGC, three triplet and doublet layers for \(1.0<|\eta|<2.4\)) provide triggering capability to the detector as well as (\(\eta\), \(\phi\)) position measurements with typical spatial resolution of \(5-10\) mm. A precise momentum measurement for muons with pseudorapidity up to \(|\eta|=2.7\) is provided by three layers of Monitored Drift Tube Chambers (MDT), with each chamber providing six to eight \(\eta\) measurements along the muon track. For \(|\eta|>2\), the inner layer is instrumented with a quadruplet of Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) instead of MDTs. The single hit resolution in the bending plane for the MDT and the CSC is about 80 \(\mu\)m and 60 \(\mu\)m, respectively.

During the shutdown preceding the LHC Run 2, the MS was completed to its initial design [12] by adding the last missing chambers in the transition region between the barrel and the end-caps (\(1.0<|\eta|<1.4\)). Four RPC-equipped MDT chambers were also installed inside two elevator shafts to improve the efficiency in that region compared to Run 1. Some of the new MDT chambers are made of tubes with a smaller radius compared to the ones used in the rest of the detector, allowing the detector to cope with higher rates.

The material between the IP and the MS ranges approximately from 100 to 190 radiation lengths, depending on \(\eta\), and consists mostly of calorimeters. The sampling liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter covers \(|\eta|<3.2\) and is surrounded by hadronic calorimeters based on iron and scintillator tiles for \(|\eta|\lesssim 1.5\) and on LAr for larger values of \(|\eta|\).

Muon identification is performed according to various reconstruction criteria based on the information provided by the ID, MS, and calorimeter sub-detectors, leading to the definition of four muon _types_[13]. The different types are: Combined (CB) muons, formed from the successful combination of an MS track with an ID track; Segment-Tagged (ST) muons, resulting from the combination of tracks in the ID with at least one local track segment in the MDT or CSC chambers; Stand-Alone (SA) muons, occurring when the muon trajectory is reconstructed only in the MS; and Calorimeter-Tagged (CT) muons, originating from tracks in the ID that are matched to an energy deposit in the calorimeter compatible with a minimum ionizing particle. CB tracks, which make up the majority of the muon candidates, have the best performance in terms of sample purity and momentum resolution. Their parameters are obtained with a global refit that uses the hits from both the ID and MS sub-detectors.

The reconstruction of the muon types that use the MS information (SA, CB, and ST) is performed using the algorithm defined as _Chain 3_ in [13]. This algorithm has been improved by making it more robust against _fakes_ and faster by using a Hough transform [14; 15] to identify the hit patterns used to seed the segment-finding algorithm, thus providing a better background rejection early in the pattern recognition process. The calculation of the energy loss in the calorimeter has also been improved using a more detailed description of the geometry of the detector to derive an analytic parameterization of the energy loss, and tuning the final estimate combined with the energy measured in the calorimeter to achieve a precision of about 20-30 MeV for muons with transverse momentum of about 50 GeV.

## 4 Muon identification

Muon identification is performed by applying a set of quality requirements based upon the specific features of each of the muon types described in the previous section. Such requirements aim to reject fake muons coming mainly from pion and kaon decays and guarantee a robust momentum measurement. Four muon selections are currently provided for use in physics analyses: _Loose_, _Medium_, _Tight_, and _High-p\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\)_.

The _Loose_ identification criteria are designed to maximize the reconstruction efficiency while providing good quality muon tracks. They are specifically optimized for reconstructing Higgs boson candidates in the four-lepton final state [16]. All muon types are used. CT and ST muons are restricted to the \(|\eta|<0.1\) region, where the ATLAS muon spectrometer is only partially instrumented to allow for cabling and services to the calorimeters and inner detector leading to a loss of efficiency for CB tracks. SA muons are deployed between \(2.5<|\eta|<2.7\), to extend the acceptance outside the ID geometrical coverage.

The _Medium_ identification criteria provide the default selection for muons in ATLAS. They minimize the systematic uncertainties associated with muon reconstruction and calibration. Only SA and CB tracks are used in this selection. The former are required to have at least three hits in each of the three layers of MDT or CSC, and are employed only in the \(2.5<|\eta|<2.7\) region. The latter are required to have \(\geq 3\) hits on at least two layers of MDT, except for the \(|\eta|<0.1\) region where tracks with at least three hits in one single MDT layer are allowed. Moreover, a very loose selection on the compatibility between ID and MS momentum measurements is applied to suppress the contamination due to hadrons mis-identified as muons. The expected probabilities for genuine muons and hadrons mis-identified as muons (_fakes_) to satisfy the _Medium_ identification criteria are shown in Figure 1 for simulated \(t\overline{t}\) events as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\).

_Tight_ muons are selected to optimize the purity of the sample. Only CB tracks satisfying the _Medium_ requirements are considered. Cuts on the the normalized chi-squared of the combined track fit and on the the compatibility between the momenta measured in the ID and MS are applied to remove pathological tracks.

Finally, the _High-p\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\)_ selection aims to maximize the momentum resolution for tracks with transverse momenta above 100 GeV. CB muons passing the _Medium_ selection and having \(\geq 3\) hits in three different precision layers are selected. Specific regions of the MS where the alignment is still preliminary are vetoed as a precaution.

## 5 Muon reconstruction and isolation

Muon reconstruction and isolation efficiencies are measured using a tag-and-probe method [13] for both \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays.

### Muon reconstruction efficiencies

\(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays are selected by requiring the tag and the probe muons to have opposite charge and an invariant mass within 10 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) of the \(Z\) boson mass. The two muons must be emitted back-to-back in the transverse plane (\(\Delta\phi>2\)) and the tag must be isolated.

\(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays provide an abundant sample of muons at low transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}<20\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\)) and are selected by requiring the invariant mass of the oppositely charged pair to be between 2.7 and 3.5 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\).

To measure muon reconstruction efficiencies, a tag muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of at least 28 (4) \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) is required to have triggered the event readout. The probe is selected as a calorimeter-tagged muon (track reconstructed in the ID) with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) (2.5) \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) in \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) (\(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)) events. A probe is considered successfully reconstructed if a reconstructed muon is found within a cone in the \(\eta-\phi\) plane of size \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}<0.05\) around the probe track.

For \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events, residual background contributions are estimated using Monte Carlo simulation and are found to be negligible. For \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events, the background and signal rates are extracted using a fit to the invariant mass spectrum. The measured efficiencies are corrected for the efficiency of the Inner Detector track reconstruction, measured using standalone muon spectrometer tracks as probe muons. This selection yields about 50,000 \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events and 750,000 \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events.

Figure 1: Expected rates as a function of transverse momentum (left) and pseudorapidity (right) for muons fulfilling the _Medium_ requirements in simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events. The rates are shown separately for prompt isolated muons (black dots) and hadrons mis-identified as muons, _fakes_, (red triangles).

Figure 2 shows the results obtained for the _Medium_ identification algorithm for \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). High efficiencies, close to 99%, are observed over the full \(\eta\) range with the exception of the central region (\(|\eta|<0.1\)). In this region, the _Medium_ muon efficiency is reduced to below 60%. These results are found to be in excellent agreement with the prediction by the detector simulation. In Figure 3, results are shown as a function of the leading muon transverse momentum for both \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays in the high \(p_{T}\) region and \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events in the low \(p_{T}\) region.

The ratio between the efficiencies obtained in collision data and simulation, referred to as the _efficiency scale factor_, is used to correct the simulation. Systematic uncertainties are small and dominated by the normalization of the background extracted from data [13] and by the possible dependence of the scale factor on the muon charge. The statistical component of these systematic uncertainties will decrease as more data become available.

Figure 2: Muon reconstruction efficiencies for the _Medium_ identification algorithm measured in \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events (a) as a function of the muon pseudorapidity and (b) for various regions of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. The prediction by the detector simulation is depicted as red circles, while black dots indicate the observation in collision data. The bottom panel shows the ratio between expected and observed efficiencies, the efficiency scale factor. Green error bands indicate the statistical uncertainty, and orange bands the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainty.

The prediction by the detector simulation is depicted as red circles (green triangles), while black dots (blue triangles) indicate the observation in collision data for \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) (\(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)) events. The bottom panel reports the the efficiency scale factors. Green (cyan) error bands indicate the statistical uncertainty, and orange (red) bands the quadratic sum of statistical and systematic uncertainty for \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) (\(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)) events. In one bin (15 GeV \(<p_{T}<\) 20 GeV), results are given for both analyses. The luminosity indicated in the figure refers to the period in which all triggers for muon reconstruction efficiency were active for both resonances.

### Muon isolation efficiencies

\(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays are selected by requiring the tag and the probe muons to have opposite charge and a dimuon invariant mass within 10 \(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) of the \(Z\) boson mass. The isolation studies are conducted for pairs of _Medium_ muons that are separated in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) (\(\Delta R_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\geq 0.3\)) in events where the tag is well isolated.

Muon isolation is quantified by two variables based on the activity in tracking sub detectors and on calorimeters, respectively.

The track-based isolation variable, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{varcone}}\)[30], is defined as the sum of the transverse momenta of the tracks in a cone of \(\Delta R=10\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu}\) around the muon, excluding the muon-track itself. The maximum cone size is \(\Delta R=0.3\). The cone size is chosen to be \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent to improve the performance for muons from boosted particle decays. The tracks considered in the sum must originate from the primary vertex associated to the muon track, have a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), have a \(|\eta|<2.5\), at least 7 silicon hits (not more than 1 pixel holes and less than 2 silicon holes), and have a longitudinal impact parameter with respect to the primary vertex less than 3 mm.

The calorimeter-based isolation variable, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{topocone}}\)[20], is computed by summing the energies of the topological clusters around the muon in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.2\). Clusters within a smaller radius of \(\Delta R=0.1\) are excluded to remove the energy deposit from the muon itself when traversing the calorimeters. The sum is corrected for the effect of pile-up using the ambient energy density [17] computed event-by-event.

The final isolation cuts used in physics analyses are applied relative to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the muon for both the track- and calorimeter-based isolation variables. The distribution of these variables for probe muons in \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays is shown in Fig. 4. The bottom panel shows the ratio between data and simulation with the corresponding statistical uncertainty. For both variables, data and MC are in good agreement after the simulation's pile-up was re-weighed to match the data.

Figure 4: Track-based (a) and calorimeter-based (b) isolation variables, divided by \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Black points show the distribution for data, while the red histograms show the distribution for MC simulation. The bottom panel shows the ratio between data and simulation with the corresponding statistical uncertainty. The data are in good agreement with MC for the two variables. _Medium_ muons are included in the plots when the minimum angular separation between the tag and the probe is such that \(\Delta R_{\mu^{+}\mu^{-}}\geq 0.3\). The Monte Carlo is normalized to the number of events selected in data.

Isolation scale factors, defined as the ratio between isolation efficiency measured in data and MC, are provided for five sets of _isolation working points_. Each working point is tuned to satisfy the needs of different group of physics analyses. The _LooseTrackOnly_ working point is defined by cuts on the relative track-based isolation variable. The other working points are defined by cuts applied separately on both relative isolation variables. All cuts are tuned as a function of the \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) of the muon to obtain a uniform performance.

The target efficiencies of the _LooseTrackOnly_, _Loose_, and _Tight_ working points are \(\geq\) 99%, 99%, and 95%, respectively. For the _Gradient_ (_GradientLoose_) working point, the target efficiency is a function of \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) with at least 90% (95% ) at \(p_{T}\) of 25 GeV, and 99% at \(p_{T}\) of 60 GeV.

The systematic uncertainties on the scale factors are estimated by varying the selection criteria and background contribution within the uncertainties (cut on the \(Z\) mass window, the isolation of the tag muon, the minimum quality of the probe, the \(\Delta R\) between the two muons and the background contribution). The individual systematic uncertainties are considered to be uncorrelated and are added in quadrature to obtain the total systematic uncertainty. The largest contribution arises from the mass window cut in the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region, which suffers from more background, whereas the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region is dominated by statistical uncertainties and systematics due to the requirement on \(\Delta R\) between the two muons.

The comparison between the efficiency measured in data and MC for the five isolation working points is shown in Fig. 5 as a function of the transverse momentum of the muon in \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events, together with the measured scale factors (bottom plots). The plots are made using probe muons which passed the same criteria as in Fig. 4. Overall, data and MC show good agreement.

## 6 Muon momentum scale and resolution

The accurate modelling of the ATLAS detector geometry and material distribution included in the MC simulation provides a good description of the momentum of the muons produced and reconstructed in the detector. To account for second-order effects, a correction to the simulated muon momentum is derived. The corrected transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), is related to the transverse momentum originally reconstructed in simulation, \(\widetilde{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\), by the following expression [13]:

\[p_{\mathrm{T}}=\frac{\widetilde{p_{\mathrm{T}}}+\left(s_{0}+s_{1}\cdot \widetilde{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\right)}{1+\mathcal{N}(\alpha;0,1)\cdot\sqrt{\left( \Delta r_{0}/\widetilde{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\right)^{2}+\Delta r_{1}^{2}+\left( \Delta r_{2}\cdot\widetilde{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\right)^{2}}}, \tag{1}\]

where \(\alpha\) is a random variable distributed according to a normal distribution \(\mathcal{N}\) with mean 0 and variance 1. Two parameters control the momentum scales: \(s_{0}\) and \(s_{1}\). The parameter \(s_{0}\) is used to correct the momentum scale for energy losses in material. Due to the low material density before the Inner Detector, this correction applies only to MS tracks. The parameter \(s_{1}\) is used to correct for radial distortions or mis-modelling of the magnetic field integral. Three additional parameters describe the momentum resolution residual dependence: \(\Delta r_{0},\Delta r_{1}\), and \(\Delta r_{2}\). The parameter \(\Delta r_{0}\) accounts for energy loss fluctuations in the traversed material and can be neglected for ID tracks. Multiple scattering, local magnetic field distortions, and local radial distortions are modeled by the constant term \(\Delta r_{1}\). The parameter \(\Delta r_{2}\) models the intrinsic resolution effects and residual detector misalignment.

These corrections are derived separately for the ID and MS muon momentum measurements, thus allowing for a better understanding of the sources of mis-modelling in simulation. The corrected transverse 

## 4 Conclusions

Muons from \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays are required to pass _Medium_ selection criteria. The last bin includes overflows. Black dots indicate the efficiency measured in data while red circles indicate the prediction from simulation. The errors on the efficiencies are statistical. The bottom panel shows the ratio between data and simulation, as well as the statistical uncertainties (green) and combination of statistical and systematic uncertainties (orange). The largest contribution arises from the mass window cut in the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region, which suffers from more background, whereas the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region is dominated by statistical uncertainties and systematics due to the requirement on \(\Delta R\) between the two muons.

momentum for combined tracks (CB) is obtained as a linear combination of the corrected ID and MS momenta:

\[p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{CB}}=f\cdot p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ID}}+(1-f)\cdot p_{ \mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{MS}}, \tag{2}\]

where \(f\) is derived from the relative weight of each momentum measurement to the CB measurement of \(\widetilde{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\).

The momentum corrections used in this work are extracted by a template-based likelihood fit from \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays following the procedure described in [13]. The muons from the dimuon pair should be of opposite charge, have \(|\eta|<2.5\), and pass the _Medium_ selection criteria. Muons from \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) dominate the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV), while muons from \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) provide a calibration for lower momenta (\(5\mathrm{~{}GeV}<p_{\mathrm{T}}<20\) GeV). The invariant mass of the dimuon system must be in the range [2.4, 3.6] and [75, 105] GeV for \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) candidates, respectively.

Given the limited size of the data sample collected with \(\sqrt{s}=13\) \(\mathrm{~{}TeV}\) collisions, the bulk of the corrections is determined from 5.0 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data collected in 2012 and reconstructed with the same reconstruction program designed for 2015 data. The residual data-to-simulation mismodelling due to changes in the detector conditions between 2012 and 2015 is corrected using 85 pb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions collected in 2015.

The corrections are validated by comparing the results of a binned likelihood fit of a parametric probability density functions (PDF) to the invariant mass spectrum of muons from \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays in data and MC. The results are obtained as a function of the pseudorapidity of the leading muon.

The mass spectrum of each resonance is modeled by a Crystal-Ball [18, 19] PDF, of which the Gaussian component estimates the detector resolution and the exponential component approximates the residual energy loss of the muon from traversing the material. To account for the intrinsic large width of the \(Z\)-boson, the Crystal-Ball PDF is convoluted with a Breit-Wigner PDF. The mean of the Breit-Wigner PDF is fixed to the mean of the Crystal-Ball, thus preserving the scale dependence, and the width is fixed to the natural width of the \(Z\) boson [20]. Residual resolution effects are taken into account by the addition of a Gaussian PDF to the likelihood. Both the amplitude and the resolution of these secondary gaussians are estimated from simulations as a function of leading muon pseudorapidity. The non-negligible fraction of combinatorial background present in \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays is taken into account and parameterized with an exponential PDF.

Figure 6: Resolution and mean value of the dimuon invariant mass resonance measured for \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays as a function of the pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) of the leading muon. Data (black markers) are compared to simulations (red line). The filled area corresponds to the quadratic sum of all systematic uncertainties.

The maximum likelihood estimates of the mean and the resolution of the dimuon resonances measured in data and simulations are compared to assess the validity of the muon momentum corrections applied to the MC. Mean and resolution are proportional to the muon momentum scale and muon momentum resolution, respectively. The results from \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays are shown in Fig. 6. The resolution (mean) of the dimuon invariant mass peak is shown on the left (right) as a function of the pseudorapidity of the leading muon. Similar results are shown for \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays in Fig. 7. Agreement between data and simulation within systematic uncertainties is observed in all detector regions.

Many sources of systematic uncertainties are considered. A systematic uncertainty on the \(\Delta r_{2}\) parameter reflects our current understanding of the detector alignment. A variation of \(\pm 5\) GeV in the mass window used for \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) is used to estimate mismodelling in the simulation of initial and final state radiation. Systematic uncertainties describing non-linear effects in the ID scale correction are estimated by extracting the \(s_{1}\) parameter for the ID independently from fits to the \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) samples. Finally, a systematic uncertainty is introduced to account for the mismodelling due to the additional degree of freedom originated from the background modelling in data for both \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events.

## 7 Conclusion

The initial performance of the ATLAS muon reconstruction in Run 2 was studied using the first 85 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data recorded in early 2015 at \(\sqrt{s}=13\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{TeV}\). Both the reconstruction and isolation efficiencies are found to be very high (\(>99\%\) in most regions of the detector) and in good agreement with the prediction from the MC simulation. The muon momentum resolutions and scales were also measured and found to be in good agreement with the corrected MC simulations.

Figure 10: Dimuon invariant mass distribution for oppositely charged, combined muon pairs with transverse momentum above 4 GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\)  GeV and selected by any ATLAS trigger. The following resonances are clearly visible in the spectrum: \(J/\psi\), \(\psi^{\prime}\), \(\Upsilon\) resonances, and \(Z\). The shoulder visible at \(\sim\)12 GeV is not a resonance but an artifact of some of the triggers used in the selection.
