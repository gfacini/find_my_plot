###### Abstract

The conceptual design of an evaporative two-phase flow cooling system for the ATLAS SCT detector is described, using perfluorinated propane (C\({}_{3}\)Fs) as a coolant. Comparison with perfluorinated butane (C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\)) is made, although the detailed design is presented only for C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\). The two-phase pressure drop and heat transfer coefficient are calculated in order to determine the dimensions of the cooling pipes and module contacts for the Barrel SCT. The region in which the flow is homogeneous is determined. The cooling cycle, pipework, compressor, heat exchangers and other main elements of the system are calculated in order to be able to discuss the system control, safety and reliability. Evaporative cooling appears to be substantially better than the binary ice system from the point of view of safety, reliability, detector thickness, heat transfer coefficient, cost and simplicity.

## 1 Introduction

Following the comments of the LHCC and the review on the ATLAS ID cooling, it was proposed that the priority will be to establish a proof of principle for inert-fluorocarbon based cooling systems throughout the ID, with evaporative methods preferred as the best solution in terms of material, and high pressure liquids as a backup. It was also proposed that work on binary ice continues for a short time in order to finalise its proof of principle.

This document is a write-up of our talk to the ATLAS SCT and ATLAS Cooling Review Committee on 3.9.1997 and 19.9.-1997 entitled "Evaporative Cooling". The material is extended in order to cover areas which could not be dealt with in presentations of 20 minutes.

In all cooling systems so far proposed for the ATLAS SCT and Pixels, evaporative cooling is the method by which heat is extracted from the primary cooling circuit running through the detector. It is therefore legitimate to ask whether the additional primary cooling circuit using binary ice or pressurised single-phase fluid could be simply removed by circulating the two-phase (liquid and vapour) coolant directly through the cooling pipes in the detector. We shall discuss in this paper the conceptual design of such a cooling system, with views on the special requirement of achieving a low contribution to the multiple scattering, on using minimum space in the service path reserved in the detector cracks, and on satisfying the criteria of safety and reliability.

The phase transition from liquid to vapour absorbs heat by\[\dot{Q}=\dot{n}L^{0}\,, \tag{1}\]

where \(\dot{n}\) is the molar rate of vaporisation and \(L^{0}\) the latent heat of evaporation. This is convenient for pool boiling; in two-phase flow a practical form is

\[\dot{Q}=\dot{n}L^{0}\big{(}x_{2}-x_{1}\big{)}\,, \tag{2}\]

where \(x_{1,2}\) are the vapour fractions (quality factors) in the fluid before and after passing through a section of a pipe with the heat load \(\dot{Q}\).

By choosing a coolant fluid with a critical point well above the operating temperature, the latent heat is large so that the mass flow required to absorb a given heat load is low in comparison with single-phase cooling. As an example, evaporation of perfluorinated propane C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) at 258 K (-15.15 \({}^{\circ}\)C) temperature absorbs 9.2 times more heat than the warming of its subcooled liquid from 258 K to 268 K. It is therefore clear that the mass flow in evaporative cooling can be one order of magnitude lower than in subcooled liquid cooling, which entails substantial reduction in the diameter of the pipework and in the mass of the coolant and pipes themselves, both inside the detector and in the service paths. Operation at -20 \({}^{\circ}\)C coolant temperature turns the balance even more favourable for evaporative cooling; such a possibility of reduction of the operating temperature may provide a desirable headroom to deal with the thermal runoff of the sensors when they are fully irradiated. An additional bonus is that the heat transfer coefficient in two-phase flow is much higher than in monophase flow, if the cooling pipe is correctly dimensioned.

In view of the advantages of evaporative cooling, we may ask why such techniques has not been applied before in silicon vertex detectors. The following reasons have been put forward:

* Because silicon detectors have not been used in high radiation environment before, there has been no need to operate at temperatures below 0\({}^{\circ}\)C. Water has large heat capacity, good heat transfer coefficient and low mass, and therefore has been sufficient and cost effective for the present vertex detectors.
* There have been, to our knowledge, so far no conceptual designs of evaporative cooling systems for detector applications. Therefore the advantages have not been evaluated in precise numeric form.
* The trial-and-error tests which have been performed have not been based on two-phase fluid engineering studies, and have therefore produced results which have been difficult to understand and appreciate.

In the following we shall discuss the conceptual design of an evaporative cooling system using the ATLAS SCT as an example. The choice of coolant, perfluorinated propane C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\), and the cooling cycle are discussed in Sections 2 and 3. The fluid dynamic phenomena, which impose restrictions on the cooling tube dimensions, are introduced in Sections 4 and 5. The heat transfer in two-phase flow and the heat exchangers are treated in Sections 6 and 7, and the pipework, compressor and gas handling are outlined in Section 8 to the extent which is necessary in order to justify certain claims on safety. The controls and safety are discussed in Section 9 before concluding in Section 10.

## 2 Choice of Coolant

From the point of view of latent heat and heat transfer coefficient, the best low-mass fluids in the temperature range of -15 to -20 \({}^{\circ}\)C are ammonia (NH\({}_{3}\)) and methyl chloride (CH\({}_{3}\)Cl). These may not be desirable in the detector environment because of corrosion (ammonia), flammability (ammonia and methyl chloride) or ozone depletion potential (methyl chloride). We therefore compare in Table 1 the relevant properties of these fluids with propane (C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{8}\)), perfluorinated propane (C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\)) and perfluorinated butane (C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\)). Propane, however, is highly flammable and therefore may not be desirable in the underground detector. Perfluorinated propane has a higher molar mass, but is perfectly inert. This fluid is also industrially used as a high-voltage isolation, in addition to the cooling applications.

Other possible candidate coolants are ethane, butane, perfluorinated ethane and perfluorinated butane; however, the ethanes require operation at 15 bar pressure and the butanes at subatmospheric pressure, and are therefore less convenient for applications around -15 \({}^{\circ}\)C temperature. There are many other potentially suitable but more exotic fluids; however, we believe that perfluorinated propane would best fulfil the requirements of the ATLAS Inner Detector. For the purpose of comparison we shall present here also numeric results on C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) obtained using the same two-phase flow and heat transfer correlations.

## 3 Cooling Cycle

In our proposed Joule-Thomson (J-T) cycle the coolant is compressed in the superheated gas phase, cooled and condensed isobarically, and then expanded isenthalpically into the two-phase region through an orifice which controls the mass flow rate in the cycle. The two-phase fluid absorbs heat isothermally until all liquid has evaporated. The vapour enters back into the compressor closing thus the cooling cycle.

The efficiency of the cooling cycle can be improved by introducing a countercurrent heat exchanger between the condensed incoming liquid upstream the expansion orifice, and the outgoing evaporated fluid. This brings the incoming liquid further into the subcooled region and leads to a reduced flash evaporation upon expansion. The cooldown becomes somewhat slower which is a desirable advantage because it avoids thermal shock to modules and support structures whose cooling blocks should not be suddenly quenched from ambient temperature to -15 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The cooldown without thermal load can be started gradually from room temperature and is achieved by J-T expansion in the superheated gas phase.

Figure 1 shows the simplified flow diagram for cooling one layer of the ATLAS barrel SCT. The compressor is located in a surface building, together with an exchanger which cools the pressurised gas and the compressor by the flow of water close to ambient temperature, so that no condensation occurs. This is to enable sending the compressed fluid down to the detector in the pit without creating an excessive gravitational pressure in the fluid column. Close to the detector another heat exchanger condenses the gas using water slightly above the dew point in the cavern (about 13 \({}^{\circ}\)C); this avoids the need of substantial isolation on the pipework of either the coolant fluid or the water pipes, thus saving space outside the detector and facilitating leak testing using a helium mass spectrometer. If operation at a lower input pressure is desirable, the condenser can be operated with chilled water at 6 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The slightly subcooled liquid is further cooled in a coaxial countercurrent heat exchanger which is located in the detector crack; depending on the dew point at that location, the exchanger may need some thermal isolation. The countercurrent exchanger has rather small dimensions, which will be discussed in Section 7, and in any case takes less space than the separate input and output lines. The input line is manifolded before the expansion orifices at the barrel layer into the same number of cooling pipes as the number of rows of modules on that particular layer.

The enthalpy-pressure diagram of the above cooling cycle is shown in Figure 2. Compression of the fluid from 2.5 to 9 bar, assumed here adiabatic for simplicity, takes place from point A to point B; the diagram indicates that the gas is heated from 20 to about 60 \({}^{\circ}\)C. In reality the output gas temperature will be slightly above 70 \({}^{\circ}\)C due to the real efficiency of the compressor. The gas is then cooled isobarically back to 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C between the points B and C, without entering into the two-phase region. The condensation takes place isobarically between C and D, and subcooling is achieved in the countercurrent heat exchanger from D to E. The J-T expansion from 9 to 2.6 bar pressure happens between E and F; the diagram shows that only a small (= 5%) amount of flash evaporation occurs because of the subcooling. Heat is absorbed from the cooling pipes almost isothermally from point F to G, which remains in the two phase region preserving a safety margin to cover possible need of additional cooling of the optical data links (a few hundred mW/module) and the power cables mounted in the low-temperature environment. The margin is also needed to compensate any slight flow imbalance in the parallellines. Furthermore, it is desirable that the specific heat of the liquid which is higher than that of the gas in the countercurrent heat exchanger will be compensated by some unboiled liquid entering the low pressure stream of the exchanger. As the diagram is drawn, a rather generous design margin is left so that the heat load at 258 K may be increased by about 50% without affecting the temperature of the two-phase coolant in the pipes. From G to H the fluid is warmed up in the countercurrent heat exchanger and further from H to A in the detector crack. The heat absorption capability from H to A can be used for cooling power cables in the detector crack (total power dissipation about 2 kW).

As one rather small compressor is sufficient for cooling the whole Barrel SCT, it might be simplest to feed the entire subdetector part using only one countercurrent heat exchanger. This would minimise the number of pipe connections which have to be made at the time of the final assembly and demounted during detector disassembly. From the point of view of using the enthalpy of the outgoing gas for cooling of power cables, it may, however, be desirable to manifold each barrel layer already outside the detector; this also allows the independent control of the cooling power and temperature of each SCT barrel layer. These will be discussed in Sections 8 and 9.

The flow in one parallel cooling pipe of the above cooling cycle is obtained by requiring that 50% of the latent heat of evaporation is used in the cooling pipes to absorb the maximum heat load from the modules:

\[\dot{n}=2\,\frac{N\dot{Q}_{\rm mod}}{L^{0}}=7.5\ {\rm mMol}\,/\,{\rm s}\equiv 1.4 \ {\rm g}\,/\,{\rm s}\,, \tag{3}\]

where \(N=12\) is the number of barrel modules in each row, \(\dot{Q}_{\rm mod}=5.45\) W is the maximum heat load from each module of which 4.45 W comes from the front-end hybrid electronics and 1 W from the sensors after full irradiation. With the total number of rows in the 4 barrel layers of 176 = (32 + 40 + 48 + 56), the maximum total flow of the ATLAS Barrel SCT is 1.32 Mol/s which is equivalent to the C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) mass flow of 248 g/s. The molar flow rates with the other coolants would be similar; in the case of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) the required flow in a cooling pipe is 5.4 mMol/s which is equivalent to a mass flow of 1.3 g/s and gives a total flow of 228 g/s for the Barrel SCT.

The total heat load and mass flow requirement for the two ATLAS Forward SCT end-caps is rather close to the Barrel SCT and need not to be separately discussed here. Their manifolding, however, is much more complicated and will require a detailed engineering study. From the point of view of the cooling cycle there is no problem in adjusting the mass flow in each parallel cooling pipe so that it corresponds to the number of modules attached to the particular line. This can be easily achieved by using calibrated capillary pipes rather than orifices for the J-T expansion.

## 4 Pressure Drop

In this Section we shall discuss the design of the pipework inside the detector and calculate the dimensions of the pipes in each sector of the circuit cooling the Barrel SCT. In the sectors with two-phase flow, it is assumed that the flow is homogeneous, i.e. for low quality factor \(x\) (= vapour fraction) we have bubble flow, and for higher \(x\) we have annular mist flow.

Homogeneous flow is desirable because it ensures a high heat transfer coefficient in the cooling pipes, and minimises low-frequency vibrations in pipe sectors with bends. The conditions under which homogeneous flow is obtained are discussed in the next Section.

### Cooling pipes

The pressure drop in two-phase flow inside a heated tube arises from flow friction and from fluid dynamic effects which are due to the increased momentum of the fluid. In homogeneous two-phase flow the frictional pressure gradient can be calculated from

\[\frac{dp}{dz}=\big{(}1-x\big{)}^{2-n}\,\Phi_{L}^{2}(X)\bigg{(}\frac{dp}{dz} \bigg{)}_{x=0} \tag{4}\]

which relates the two-phase pressure gradient to that with liquid only at the total mass flow \(\dot{m}\). The latter pressure gradient can be obtained from

\[\bigg{(}\frac{dp}{dz}\bigg{)}_{x=0}=f\,\frac{G^{2}}{2D\rho_{L}}\,, \tag{5}\]

where \(G\) is the total mass flow per cross sectional area, \(D\) is the hydrodynamic diameter of the tube (the diameter itself for a circular tube), and \(f\) is the friction factor

\[f=0.0056+0.50N_{\text{Re}}^{-0.32}\,. \tag{6}\]

Furthermore, \(n=0.2\) for turbulent flow valid for the case of C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\), \(x\) is the fluid quality factor, and \(z\) is the co-ordinate along the tube axis The function \(\Phi_{L}^{2}(X)\) is the dimensionless Martinelli-Nelson correlation where \(X\) is the dimensionless Martinelli parameter defined by

\[X^{2}=\frac{\bigg{(}\frac{dp}{dz}\bigg{)}_{1}}{\bigg{(}\frac{dp}{dz}\bigg{)}_ {g}}=\Bigg{(}\frac{N_{\text{Re}}^{G}}{N_{\text{Re}}^{L}}\Bigg{)}^{0.2}\bigg{(} \frac{\dot{m}_{L}}{\dot{m}_{G}}\bigg{)}^{2}\frac{\rho_{G}}{\rho_{L}}=\bigg{(} \frac{1-x}{x}\bigg{)}^{1.8}\bigg{(}\frac{\eta_{L}}{\eta_{G}}\bigg{)}^{0.2}\, \frac{\rho_{G}}{\rho_{L}}\] (7a) in the case of turbulent flow in both phases of C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\). Here \[N_{\text{Re}}=D\dot{m}/\big{(}A\eta\big{)}\] is the Reynolds number, \[\dot{m}\] is the total mass flow, \[A\] is the cross-sectional area of the flow channel, \[\eta\] is the viscosity, and the indices \[L\] and \[G\] refer to the liquid and gas phases, respectively. The pressure gradients in the definition of the Martinelli \[X\] are those obtained when the pipe is filled with liquid or gas alone flowing at the rates \[(1-x)\,\dot{m}\] or \[x\,\dot{m}\], respectively. The empirical curve \[\Phi_{L}^{2}(X)\] from [1] was fit by the function \[\Phi_{L}(X)=\sqrt{a_{0}+a_{1}X^{-1}+a_{2}X^{-2}+a_{3}X^{-3}}\,\] (8) with \[a_{0}=1.1664\pm 0.0551;\] \[a_{1}=12.8077\pm 0.6324;\] \[a_{2}=4.2156\pm 0.2156;\] \[a_{3}=0.0040038\pm 0.0016791\]

with errors reflecting the quality of the data and the fit.

Assuming a fairly low relative pressure drop which is desirable in order to obtain a uniform temperature of the detector, we may take the Martinelli-Nelson correlation to be a function of only; this simplifies its integration when calculating the pressure drop. Using \(\Phi_{L}^{2}(X)\) of Eq. (8) and \(X\) of Eq. (7a) with C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) fluid data at 258 K temperature and 2.461 bar saturation pressure was fit using the function

\[\Phi_{L}(x)=\left[\frac{b_{1}x}{b_{3}-x}+b_{2}x^{\frac{1}{b_{4}}}+1\right]^{p_{4 }}\,, \tag{8}\]

the form of which was chosen to give asymptotically correct values for \(x=0\) and \(x=1\). The fit parameters are

\[\begin{split} b_{1}&=1.1792\pm 0.0400;\\ b_{2}&=2.9827\pm 0.1231;\\ b_{3}&=1.0475\pm 0.0029;\\ b_{4}&=1.8835\pm 0.0337\end{split}\] (9a) with errors reflecting the capability of the function to fit the data and the quality of the graph from which the data was obtained, which can be judged from their plot in Fig. 3.

Assuming a constant heat input per unit length of the barrel cooling tube along its 1.5 m length, the integral of Eq. ( 4 ) can be simplified to yield the frictional pressure drop \[\Delta p_{f}=\frac{L}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\left(\frac{dp}{dz}\right)_{x=0}\int\limits _{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}(1-x)^{2-n}\,\Phi_{L}^{2}(x)dx\,.\] (9b)

With the inner diameter of 1.4 mm, C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) mass flow of 1.4 g/s, the range of input quality factors \(x_{1}\) from 0 to 0.5, and heat load of 64.5 W from the 12 modules attached to the tube, numerical integration of Eq. ( 9 ) yields the frictional pressure distribution along the tube shown in Fig. 4a for various input quality factors at constant heat load and mass flow.

The gas dynamic pressure gradient, mainly due to the increase of the quality factor following heating and evaporation, can be expressed and integrated analytically in the conditions described above, yielding

\[\Delta p_{m}=\Phi_{m}\frac{\dot{m}^{2}}{A^{2}\rho_{L}}10^{-6}\,\frac{\mathrm{ cm\ s}}{\mathrm{g}}\,\mathrm{bar}\,, \tag{10}\]

where

\[\Phi_{m}=\frac{\left(1-x_{2}\right)^{2}}{R_{L2}}-\frac{\left(1-x_{1}\right)^{ 2}}{R_{L1}}+\left[\frac{x_{2}^{2}}{R_{G2}}-\frac{x_{1}^{2}}{R_{G1}}\right] \frac{\rho_{L}}{\rho_{G}} \tag{11}\]

depends only on the difference between the input and output quality factors; in our case \(x_{2}-x_{1}=0.5\) which gives \(\Phi_{m}=30.8\). In the above formula \(R_{L,G}\) are the volume fractions of the liquid and gas, respectively, at the points 1 and 2.

The sum of the frictional and gas dynamic pressure drops are shown in Fig. 4a, together with the pressure distribution in the case that only gas flows through the unheated pipe. The last is plotted to ensure that the numeric calculations are correct, which can be seen in the asymptotic approach of the curve to the points for the output quality factor \(x_{2}=1\).

The temperature distribution of the fluid along the cooling tubes is obtained by using the temperature dependence of the saturated vapour pressure of C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\), given by the dynamic pressure distribution of Fig. 4a. The resulting temperature distributions are shown in Fig. 5a for the different input quality factors. For \(x_{\text{in}}=0.05\) we note that in the beginning of the tube the fluid is about 2.35 \({}^{\circ}\)C warmer than in the outlet.

In the case of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) the liquid Reynolds number is 1350 for the pipe diameter of 4 mm and quality factor \(x=0\), and the liquid flow is therefore laminar at all values of \(x\). The gas flow, however, is turbulent already at low values of \(x\), and we assume here that correlations for the case of laminar liquid flow and turbulent gas flow throughout the pipe length can be used without significant error. The correlations for the two-phase flow pressure drop are then

\[X^{2}=\frac{16}{0.046}\frac{\left(N_{\text{Re}}^{G}\right)^{0.2}}{N_{\text{Re} }^{L}}\left(\frac{\dot{m}_{L}}{\dot{m}_{G}}\right)^{2}\frac{\rho_{G}}{\rho_{L} }=\frac{16}{0.046}\frac{\left(N_{\text{Re}}^{G}\left(x=1\right)\right)^{0.2}} {N_{\text{Re}}^{L}\left(x=0\right)}\frac{1-x}{x^{1.8}}\frac{\rho_{G}}{\rho_{L}} \tag{7b}\]

and the fit parameters for Eq. (8') are

\[b_{1} =1.6649\pm 0.0626;\] (8'b) \[b_{2} =4.1896\pm 0.1746;\] \[b_{3} =1.0497\pm 0.0029;\] \[b_{4} =1.9169\pm 0.0329\]

The pressure drop is now integrated numerically from

\[\Delta p_{f}=\frac{L}{x_{2}-x_{1}}\left(\frac{dp}{dz}\right)_{x=0}\int_{x_{1} }^{x_{2}}\left(1-x\right)\Phi_{L}^{2}\left(x\right)dx. \tag{9b}\]

yielding the pressure and temperature along the barrel cooling pipe shown in Figures 4b and 5b.

The local average density of the coolant

\[\overline{\rho}=\rho_{G}\frac{1}{x\left(1-\frac{\rho_{G}}{\rho_{L}}\right)+ \frac{\rho_{G}}{\rho_{L}}}\]

is closer to that of the gas than liquid for \(x\geq.05\). The mass of the coolant in the cooling pipe of 1.6 m length and 1.4 mm diameter is

\[m_{coolant}=\frac{\rho_{G}V_{pipe}}{\left(x_{2}-x_{1}\right)\left(1-\frac{\rho _{G}}{\rho_{L}}\right)}\log\frac{x_{2}\left(1-\frac{\rho_{G}}{\rho_{L}}\right) +\frac{\rho_{G}}{\rho_{L}}}{x_{1}\left(1-\frac{\rho_{G}}{\rho_{L}}\right)+ \frac{\rho_{G}}{\rho_{L}}}\]

which yields 0.191 g for one pipe for \(x_{1}=0.1\) and \(x_{2}=0.5\); the mass depends only weakly on the inlet quality factor. The total mass of the coolant in the Barrel SCT cooling pipes is thus 33.7 g. The mass of the cooling pipe, for 0.1 mm CuNi walls, is 5.6 g which gives 991 g total weight of CuNi for the Barrel SCT.

The Table 2 below shows the contributions of the cooling tube and coolant to the thickness of the SCT barrel module, distributed on the silicon sensor area. The total thickness of 0.102 \(\%X_{0}\) should be compared with that of the module itself, which is 1.20 \(\%X_{0}\). It is clear that reduction of the pipe wall thickness below 0.1 mm is desirable.

In the case of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) with 4.0/4.2 mm ID/OD CuNi pipes the contribution to the barrel module thickness is 0.292 %\(X_{0}\), dominated also by the pipe.

### Barrel layer feed and outlet pipes

Table 3 shows the pressure drop per unit length in each input and output line for the 4 barrel layers at the maximum design mass flow rate. The input lines have inside diameters between 5 and 6 millimetres, resulting in pressure drops around 100 mbar/m for the subcooled liquid of C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\). The output lines can be all 12 mm in diameter, resulting in pressure drops between 150 and 54 mbar/m. The output line pressure gradient was determined for the fluid quality factor \(x\) = 0.63 which gives the maximum pressure drop. In normal operation the outlet quality factor would be closer to 0.5. The pipe diameter can be reduced to 8 mm and the pressure drop reduced if several parallel pipes are used for the outlet of each barrel layer.

In the case of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) the inlet line diameter is similar to that shown in the Table 2, whereas the outlet lines have to be about 3 times larger in diameter.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Item & Material & Volume & Mass & \(X_{0}\) & Thickness \\  & & (mm\({}^{3}\)) & (g) & (g/cm\({}^{2}\)) & (\% of \(X_{0}\)) \\ \hline Cooling tube & CuNi 70/30 & 60.31859 & 0.530804 & 12.892 & 0.10115 \\ Coolant & C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) & 197.04071 & 0.015304 & 34.641 & 0.00108 \\  & & & & Total & 0.10223 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Countercurrent heat exchanger

The pressure drops in the countercurrent heat exchanger, the geometry of which will be described in Section 7, are given in the Table 4. On the cold side we have assumed \(x=1\) which gives a pessimistic estimate.

With C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) the cold return channel diameter needs to be increased substantially (a factor of about 3) because of the low pressure of the fluid at this point. An alternative solution of using a plate heat exchanger may be attractive; in this case, however, the exchanger can hardly be mounted inside the detector, and the fluid input pipes must therefore be well isolated thermally in the detector crack.

### Pipe runs from compressor to pit

The floor of the ATLAS detector cavern is 92.5 m below the floor of the surface buildings, where we propose to locate the compressors of the SCT cooling system. The level difference between the compressor and the condenser entails gravitational pressure differences of 74.3 mbar and 16.7 mbar for the high-pressure (9 bar) and low-pressure (2.3 bar) columns of the perfluorinated propane fluid. Evidently one has to avoid condensation in the high-pressure line, which might benefit from a small amount of thermal isolation in order to avoid minor thermal losses during standby operation, particularly in winter with shielding removed from the pit during maintenance.

The length of the compressor input and output lines might be about 110 m. The pressure differences in the lines are calculated for C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) for two line diameters in the Table 5. The diameters in the case of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) are about twice larger.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

suggests that for \(x\leq 0.37\) the regime is homogeneous bubble flow, whereas for higher \(x\) we have mist flow which is also homogeneous. Reduction of the total mass flow rate by a factor of two will still maintain the homogeneous flow regime, and the same is true if the vapour pressure is reduced by a factor of two. Figure 6 therefore suggests that the homogeneous flow regime can be maintained in all possible operating conditions with the cooling tube diameter of 1.4 mm.

The circles plotted in Fig. 6 are data calculated for C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) at 258 K temperature under saturated vapour pressure, for the molar flow rate of 5.4 mMol/s and pipe diameter of 4.0 mm, and for various vapour fractions with intervals of 0.05. The plot suggests that for \(x<0.3\) the slug flow pattern results; in this case the pressure drop and heat transfer coefficients calculated by using the homogeneous flow model may be even more erroneous than \(\pm 40\%\) which is quoted for homogeneous flow. Furthermore, the flow becomes intermittent and unstable, leading to temporal variations of the pressure gradient and the heat transfer coefficient.

An analysis which gives better extrapolation to unusual fluids and to extreme conditions of horizontal flow [3] due to Taitel and Dukler, indicates that for \(x\geq 0.1\) the cooling pipes have annular mist flow of C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) with a large safety margin of more than 10 in the terms of the Froude parameter

\[Fr=\frac{G_{{}_{G}}}{\left[\rho_{{}_{G}}(\rho_{{}_{L}}-\rho_{{}_{G}})gD \right]^{\nicefrac{{1}}{{2}}}}\,,\]

and that for \(x\) lower than 0.1 we have bubbly flow. Figure 7a shows the Taitel and Dukler flow pattern regions together with the points plotted for the cases of C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) and C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) in 1.4 mm and 4.0 mm cooling pipes, respectively. In this case both fluids would seem to fall in the annular mist flow regime. The Taitel and Dukler parameter

\[T=\sqrt{\frac{\left[\left(dp/dz\right)_{1}\right]}{g\left(\rho_{{}_{L}}-\rho_ {{}_{G}}\right)}}\]

allows, in principle, to differentiate between bubbly and slug/plug flow regimes when Martinelli \(X\) is greater than 1. In our case, however, we have mostly \(X\leq 1\), and therefore the criterion, shown in Fig. 7b, does not enable to differentiate between the flow patterns.

Without going into the detailed analysis of the flow in other parts of the system where we have two phases, we note that it is easy to achieve the homogeneous flow regime as long as a reasonable pressure drop can be allowed. This, of course, is easily achieved when operating at elevated pressure and with a fairly dense gas. With C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) the margin for homogeneous flow might be much smaller owing to the required lower operating pressure and larger pipe diameters, and therefore stable operation can be achieved in a more narrow range of temperatures than in the case of C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\). This restricts the use of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) to applications with shorter cooling pipes.

## 6 Heat Transfer in Two-Phase Flow

We shall now discuss the heat transfer coefficient which is defined as \(\,h=\dot{Q}/\!\left(A_{{}_{h}}\Delta T\right)\,\), and which relates the heat flux to the difference between the heated wall temperature and the average temperature of the flowing fluid.

The heat transfer to the flow of a boiling liquid is much higher than to the flow of subcooled fluid, owing to the fact that two efficient mechanisms work in parallel. The two-phase flow heat transfer coefficient [3]

\[h_{B}=h_{NB}+h_{FC} \tag{12}\]

is the sum of terms due to the nucleate boiling on the pipe wall, and to the forced-convection heat transfer through the thin liquid film covering the tube wall in the annular flow regime. The nucleate boiling term can be obtained from the Forster-Zuber equation for pool boiling and the two-phase flow suppression factor \(S\)

\[h_{NB}=Sh_{FZ}=S\cdot 0.00122\,\Delta T_{sat}^{0.24}\,\Delta p_{sat}^{0.75} \,\frac{C_{pl}^{0.45}\rho_{L}^{0.49}\kappa_{L}^{0.79}}{\sigma^{0.5}L_{0}^{0.24} \eta_{L}^{0.29}\rho_{G}^{0.24}}\,, \tag{13}\]

where \(\,\Delta T_{sat}\,\) is the difference between the saturation temperature of the flowing fluid and the temperature of the tube wall, and \(\,\Delta p_{sat}\,\) the difference between the pressure of the flowing fluid and its saturation pressure at the wall temperature. The suppression factor is a function of the liquid Reynolds number and is a universal parameter for all fluids. It is clear that the nucleate boiling term of Eq. (13) is not a constant but depends on the temperature difference. Further complications arise from the fact that the wall characteristics influence the magnitude of the nucleate boiling term; these lead to the uncertainty of about \(\pm 40\%\) in the heat transfer to the flow of a boiling fluid.

The forced convection part can be determined from

\[h_{FC}=Fh_{L} \tag{14}\]

where \(F\) is the two-phase flow heat transfer coefficient multiplier and \(h_{L}\) is the single-phase flow heat transfer coefficient which is proportional to the Nusselt number

\[Nu_{L}\equiv\frac{h_{L}D}{\kappa_{L}}=0.023N_{\mathrm{Re},L}^{0.8}N_{\mathrm{ Pr},L}^{0.4}\,, \tag{15}\]

where

\[N_{\mathrm{Re},L}=\frac{(1-x)GD}{\eta_{L}} \tag{16}\]

and

\[N_{\mathrm{Pr},L}=\frac{\eta_{L}C_{pl}}{\kappa_{L}} \tag{17}\]

The multiplying factor \(F\) is a universal dimensionless function of the Martinelli parameter \(X\) of Eq. (7). The functions \(F\) and \(S\) are shown in Figure 8a and 8b together with the fits which are used in evaluating the two-phase flow heat transfer coefficient.

Figure 9 shows the heat transfer parameters and the temperature difference between the tube wall and fluid for the \(1.4\,\)mm and \(4.0\,\)mm diameter tube walls and the two-phase coolants C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) and C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\), respectively, at the module cooling contacts of \(3\,\)cm length. As was said above, the relationship between the heat flux and the temperature difference is not linear, and therefore the result cannot be scaled in a straightforward manner to other dimensions of the cooling contact; however, it is clear that a longer contact will result in a lower difference between the wall and the fluid temperatures.

Comparing with the single-phase heat transfer coefficient of Eq. (14), we note that under the conditions of the above example, the heat transfer to the evaporating fluid is higher by a factor of about 10. The comparison, of course, is somewhat hypothetical, because the design of a subcooled fluid cooling system capable of absorbing the heat load of one row of the barrel modules must have a mass flow about ten times higher, which forces to use a larger pipe. This, in turn, drops the heat transfer coefficient but enlarges the contact surface, with a net effect that an even larger temperature drop will be observed.

## 7 Heat Exchangers

The water cooled heat exchanger and condenser are standard industrial devices with leak tightness and pressure specifications adapted for our application. The compressor and gas cooler for both the Barrel and the Forward SCT must be rated at 8 kW and water flow of 4 l/min, whereas the condenser has a load of 22 kW and chilled water flow of 27 l/min at 13 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Their detailed engineering is not discussed here.

The countercurrent heat exchangers are best designed so that each Barrel SCT layer is served by an independent coaxial tube exchanger, to which subcooled liquid is fed from a common condenser. These devices are made by inserting a special exchanger (rifle) tube inside a smooth tube. The rifle tube has fine helical grooves on its inner surface. The grooves spin the low-pressure (L.P.) two-phase flow so that liquid mist is forced to the wall, thus promoting the heat transfer by an enhancement factor of about 2.5 above that for a smooth tube of same diameter. The high-pressure (H.P.) subcooled fluid flows in opposite direction in the annular space between the two tubes; a helical insert centres the tubes so that all of the outer surface of the inner tube is efficient in heat transfer.

The efficiency of such a heat exchanger can be determined from the thermal unit number

\[N_{u}=\frac{UA_{h}}{\dot{n}c_{p,L}}=\frac{\pi L}{\dot{n}c_{p,L}}\Bigg{(}\frac {1}{D_{1}h_{h}}+\frac{1}{\eta D_{c}h_{c}}\Bigg{)}^{\!\!-1} \tag{18}\]

where the indices \(h\) and \(c\) refer to the hot and cold sides of the exchanger wall, \(L\) is the active length of the exchanger, \(\eta\) is the efficiency of the extended cold surface, and the diameters are defined in Fig. 11. With boiling on the cold side the efficiency becomes simply

\[\varepsilon=1-\exp\!\left(-N_{u}\right). \tag{19}\]

Figure 11 shows the proposed geometry of the countercurrent heat exchanger, the length of which was adjusted for each barrel layer so that same efficiency and outlet temperature could be obtained for each barrel layer. In calculating the efficiency it was assumed that on the cold side the heat transfer coefficient was that due to single phase gas flow only, but the rifle tube multiplier was applied to obtain \(N_{tu}\). This is a rather pessimistic approximation, and the real \(N_{tu}\) may be about 50% higher than the values given in Table 6. The purpose of Table 6 is to show that a coaxial tube heat exchanger of 3 m length and 1.6 cm diameter is sufficient for subcooling the perfluorinated propane liquid before the Joule-Thomson expansion.

As was stated in Section 4.3, the low operating pressure of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) makes the use of a coaxial countercurrent exchanger rather impractical and requires its replacement by a plate heat exchanger mounted outside the detector.

## 8 Pipework, Gas Handling and Compressor

The simplified schematic of the main cooling loop is shown in Fig. 1, with only one barrel layer cooling tubes explicitly drawn. The other barrel layers are manifolded before the countercurrent heat exchangers, as indicated in the drawing. In addition to these, some pipes, valves, reservoirs, demountable vacuum joints and other components are required for the following functions:

* Evacuation of the whole circuit and some selected parts of it;
* Leak testing using a helium mass spectrometer, with isolation of selected parts under test;
* Coolant input, storage and removal;
* Compressor and oil filter maintenance;
* Compressor replacement during operation (depending on the mean time between failures (MTBF) of the selected compressor);
* Standby operation with no or reduced module power (for example during detector tests at the time of assembly and alignment in the surface building, and during the annual shutdown of LHC);
* Detector access and disassembly, and possibly transport of the cooled subdetector parts after radiation damage.
* Purge with inert gas such as N\({}_{2}\).

It is clear that the reliability of the cooling system requires that the whole pipework system be of hermetic all-metal construction, with metal gaskets and metal bellows sealed valves. The pipe materials could be 70/30 cupronickel in the thin-walled parts, and 316 L\(+\)N stainless steel elsewhere with the exception of some parts of the heat exchangers which must be made of pure copper. There are no problems with electrochemical corrosion in such pipework, because the coolant is highly non-conductive and does not even dissolve water.

The demountable joints in the pipework should be CEFILAC Kenol type or similar, with aluminium or copper gaskets.

\end{table}

A reservoir is required for the storage of the coolant during shutdown of the cooling system. Storage in liquid form may be most convenient; the reservoir must then have chilled water cooling or an input heat exchanger in order to speed up fluid recovery. A heater is also needed for speeding up gas input to the cooling circuit.

The detailed engineering of the pipework is not discussed here.

The multivane rotary compressor should be followed by an oil removal system, which could consist of a cascade of a cyclone oil separator, an oil mist filter using porous material, and an activated charcoal or molecular sieve oil vapour absorber. The separated liquid oil returns back to the compressor from the two first stages. Such purifier systems provide excellent results in the case of helium cryocoolers. The oil removal, however, is not critical in our proposed cooling system (unlike cryocoolers), when using a fluorocarbon oil which is soluble in perfluorinated propane; based on this principle, ordinary freezers operate without any oil separation reliably during many years without ever requiring maintenance.

The minimum electrical power requirement of the compressor for the Barrel SCT is, for operation with 2.3 bar input and 9 bar output pressure of C\({}_{3}\)Fs,

\[\dot{Q}_{E_{i}}=\frac{1}{\eta}\,\dot{n}\Delta H_{AB}=5.8\ \mathrm{kW} \tag{20}\]

where \(\eta\) is the total adiabatic efficiency of the compressor, assumed here 70%, and AB refers to the points A and B in the enthalpy diagram of Fig. 2. In order to deal with exceptional or transient circumstances, to allow operation at lower input and higher output pressures, and to provide a safety margin, the electrical rating of the compressor should be about 10 kW.

The minimum volume speed requirement for the compressor is

\[\dot{V}=\dot{n}V_{M}\,\frac{p_{STP}}{p_{in}}=\ 14\ \frac{\mathrm{l}\mathrm{l} \mathrm{l}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{e}}{\mathrm{s}}\,, \tag{21}\]

where \(V_{M}=24.41\) l/Mol is the molar volume of the coolant fluid at STP. Again, operation at reduced pressure but maximum cooling power calls for a volume speed rating of 20 - 30 litre/s; this will also enable the control of temperature of the individual barrel layers if desired (see below). There is a vast range of hermetic compressors satisfying the above requirements; some of the are dry and therefore enable to suppress the oil separators which are required with the ordinary multivane rotary compressors.

For C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) the compressor power requirement is similar to above, but the volume speed rating must be in the order of 200 - 300 litre/s. The compression might best be made using a cascade of 3 or 4 hermetic Root's blowers which do not contaminate the gas stream.

## 9 Controls and Safety

Evaporative cooling systems need no active controls with feedback, and monitoring in a simple system can be reduced to the input and output pressures of the compressor. The manifolding of the barrel layers and the individual cooling pipes, however, require additional monitoring in order to assure oneself that there is sufficient cooling power available throughout the volume of the detector. We therefore propose to monitor the mass flow at the output of all foul barrel layers using four calorimetric mass flowmeters outside the detector at the point where the four low-pressure flows are manifolded back to one compressor return pipe. If the mass flows of the individual layers are adjusted using manual control valves in the H.P. lines after manifolding, four pressure gauges will be convenient downstream of the pressure reduction valves. Similarly, four pressure gauges are needed in the L.P. lines before possible control valves for the adjustment of the temperatures of the individual barrel layers. It is clear that these valves are also useful for shutting off the cooling of the inner three layers of the barrel when operating in the standby mode.

Pressure monitoring inside he detector would be cumbersome and unnecessary. Instead, Pt100 temperature sensors which have low magnetoresistance and high radiation resistance, should be used for probing each individual cooling pipe at a few points. In addition, the temperature of the common feed line of each layer should be monitored. This, together with the pressure of the line and the temperature after the expansion orifice, allows one to determine the fluid pressure and quality factor in the beginning of the cooling tubes from the enthalpy diagram. The cooling tube output pressures can be estimated from the pressure measured outside the detector; the comparison of this with the pressure after expansion gives an estimate for the pressure drop and mass flow in each parallel cooling tube.

In addition it may be desirable to measure the temperatures of the last module cooling block and of the end of each cooling pipe, in order to ensure that some unboiled liquid will be left in each parallel cooling pipe, and that the two-phase heat transfer will be sufficiently high throughout the pipes. This is to prevent arriving at such a high quality factor that the heat contact area will become dry which reduces dramatically the heat transfer coefficient.

To get an idea of the distribution of the temperatures along the cooling pipes, it may be interesting to measure the temperature of the cooling block of the first module in each pipe also.

The countercurrent heat exchangers may need monitoring of the input and output temperatures of each stream. In addition, the water cooled exchanger and the condenser require monitoring of the input and output temperatures of the fluorocarbon fluid and the water.

The pressure, temperature and weight of the coolant storage reservoir needs also to be measured, in order to be able to estimate the quantity of the coolant in the circuit.

The adjustment and control of the cooling system can be entirely manual, in order to minimise the risks associated with active devices. The control of the mass flow and therefore of the cooling power is done by adjusting the compressor output pressure, which is done by manual control of the amount of coolant fluid in the circuit. The balance between the individual barrel layers can be controlled manually using the valves placed after the manifolding point of the H.P. line, as was described above.

The adjustment of the temperature of the coolant, and therefore of the temperatures of the modules, is easily accomplished by controlling manually the output pressure of the cooling pipes using the valves which were described above. This, of course, requires that the volume speed of the compressor is sufficient for covering the desired temperature range; reduction of the coolant temperature to 248 K (- 25 \({}^{\circ}\)C), for example, imposes operation at 1.668 bar pressure inside the cooling tubes, and requires the compressor to be able to achieve the required mass flow at an input pressure of about 1.2 bar, thus doubling the volume speed from the minimum of Eq. (21).

The safety and reliability of the proposed cooling system depends on the detailed engineering of its components, and therefore we cannot enter here in quantitative analysis. It is clear,however, that the simplicity of the system provides reliability based on physical principles rather than on active devices which are always the weakest point in any cooling system.

The following sources of risk, presented in the order of decreasing probability, need to be understood and analysed:

* Operator fault;
* Electrical power failure and subsequent power-up;
* Cooling water failure and subsequent recovery;
* Small leaks;
* Pipe failures leading to large leaks.

Operator fault is the most common risk factor in a complex systems, and this can only be minimised by training and access control so that the manual adjustments described above are allowed only to authorised persons. As no adjustments are normally necessary after the initial setting-up of the cooling system, simple measures are sufficient for reducing the risks due to operator faults.

Electrical power failure stops the compressor but also the power feed to the detector. As the warm-up of the detector is rather slow without power dissipation in the modules, there is ample time to restart with emergency power if necessary. The compressor start-up, however, requires some precautions in monitoring the state of the system, and may need the manual operation of the inlet valve, and temporary storage of a part of the coolant fluid. Entirely automatic start-up may require active control loops which reduce the reliability of the overall system.

Expansion of the coolant in the closed circuit after electrical failure and long warm-up may lead to an overpressure which exceeds the safe limit of the thin-wall cooling tubes. This can be avoided by placing a passive mechanical safety valve to the output line of the detector cooling circuit in order to release the expanding gas to a sufficiently large reservoir. As the amount of coolant in the circuit is rather small, this reservoir takes minor space in the surface building.

Failure of the water cooling of the compressor and its outlet will force to stop the compressor, and the start-up requires the same precautions as above. Failure of the chilled water circuit cooling the condenser will lead to increasing pressure but will only slowly reduce the cooling power and increase the detector temperature. Recovery from this depends on whether the compressor needs to be stopped before the condenser operates normally.

Small leaks of the C3F8 coolant from the circuit have no consequence to the environment or to the detector, because of the inoffensiveness of perfluorinated propane, and because it cannot condense anywhere in the detector. The possible small leak inside the detector volume will be diluted by the flow of dry nitrogen. A small leak, however, may necessitate compensating the quantity of the fluid after long operation.

A large leak, caused for example by a pipe rupture following an accident, corrosion or material fatigue, requires shutting off the part of the cooling system which can be isolated, and repairing the leak during a shutdown. If the leak occurs inside the detector, access and detector disassembly is required. Therefore the probability of pipe rupture must be minimised by careful engineering and fabrication.

A rapid loss of coolant happens if any pipework between the condensers and the expansion orifices bursts. In addition this may cause damage to materials close to the area of rupture, due to shock cooling to -37 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The liquid jet speed, however, is not very large if the pipes are correctly dimensioned; therefore the risk of mechanical damage is rather small.

Rupture of a thin-wall cooling pipe causes a jet of two-phase C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) fluid with rate of 1.4 g/s. If this is directed to the bonding wires of a module at a close distance, they may be damaged. The probability of other mechanical damage may be rather small owing to the small mass flow rate controlled by the orifice in each cooling pipe. In any case the damage here will be smaller than in any subcooled pressurised fluid system, because of the lower mass flow rates and the flow-limiting orifices.

Small leaks in C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) cooling pipes will result in the contamination of the cooling fluid by nitrogen, air and possibly water. These need to be separated from the fluid in a specially constructed gas separation plant. Water can be removed using a suitable adsorbent after the compressors. Large leaks will require isolation and shutdown of the sector of the detector cooled by the circuit with the leak.

## 10 Conclusions

The comparison with the binary ice cooling system proposed for the ATLAS SCT is based with the ATLAS Inner Detector Technical Design Report. Comparison with other cooling systems using a subcooled fluid, on which no conceptual design exists yet, is not based on accurate quantitative comparison. The following points are raised:

* Perfluorinated propane C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) is an inert, non-toxic, non-flammable and therefore safe fluid. It can be used in high radiation environment because no long-lived activity is generated and it does not degrade from radiolytic impurities, the yield of which is low due to the chemical inertness. These compare very favourably with the binary ice mixtures.
* The cooling tubes and coolant contribute 0.10223 \(\%\,X_{0}\) to the Barrel SCT module thickness at normal incidence, which is less than the contribution of 0.156 \(\%X_{0}\) due to the binary ice cooling tubes and coolant.
* The heat transfer coefficient is more than 10 times higher than the values for binary ice or subcooled fluids.
* The cooling system is very simple compared with the equipment needed for binary ice or subcooled fluid systems. No automatic controls are needed.
* The cost of an evaporative cooling system is a small fraction of the cost of a binary ice system.
* Low vibration level due to lower mass flow rate.

Before embarking in a serious engineering study, it is necessary to verify the design concepts presented in this paper by tests and measurements made with a scaled-down model. The model could be built using a 200 W compressor feeding up to 10 parallel barrel cooling tubes instrumented to determine

* The limits of flow regimes in the cooling pipes;
* Pressure drop in the cooling pipes;
* Heat transfer coefficient in the cooling pipes;
* Risks to structures or modules due to simulated pipe ruptures;
* Vibration levels and methods of their damping, if necessary.

The design concepts for the Forward SCT are in principle similar, although the cooling pipe lengths and heat loads are not all identical. Also, the manifolding of the coolant flow can be made in many different ways. We shall not discuss these here, because engineering studies will be required in order to carry out the two-phase flow design studies. These studies should take place concurrently with the verification of the tests and measurements listed above.

We believe that it is possible to extend the present design to the ATLAS Pixel detector and other LHC detectors, using identical conceptual principles. Also, it is easy to perform the same design calculations using any coolant fluid, and comparison with C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) was already made here. It appears that a cooling system using C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) can be designed to operate in a wider range of temperatures than one based on C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\), and that longer cooling pipes can be used which results in a smaller number of interconnections and therefore a greater reliability and simplicity of the cooling system. C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) also enables to use smaller cooling pipes and therefore smaller cooling blocks; these entail in a significantly smaller contribution to the detector thickness in comparison with C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\).

There is not much to be gained in choosing a lower mass coolant because the contribution of the coolant to the detector thickness is small due to the low density of the two-phase fluid and to the smallness of the pipes.

Further reduction of the detector mass can be achieved by reducing the coolant temperature while keeping the silicon temperature in the lower limit of the specified range. The resulting larger temperature gradient in the heat conduction path entails lower mass of the heat spreaders and of the cooling contacts. Lower temperature also reduces the sensor dissipation and enables to reduce the mass flow in the cooling tubes. The mechanical structures are not influenced by the lower coolant temperature because their temperature is set by the silicon and hybrids rather than by the cooling pipes owing the smallness of the pipes.

Figure 1: Simplified flow diagram for the evaporative cooling cycle of the ATLAS Barrel SCT. The compressor, oil removal components and the gas handling system are located in a surface building, and the 4 barrel layers are manifolded just outside the detector right after the chilled water condenser using water at 6 \({}^{\circ}\)C or 13 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The coaxial-tube counter-current heat exchanger is located in the detector crack just outside the SCT.

Figure 2: Enthalpy-pressure diagram for C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) with the cooling cycle shown by the thick dashed line. The superheated gas is compressed between A and B and is cooled isobarically to ambient temperature between B and C using water at room temperature. Condensation takes place isobarically between C and D using chilled water. The fluid is subcooled isobarically in the counter-current heat exchanger between D and F, and expanded isenthalpically (Joule-Thompson expansion) in a capillary pipe or orifice from E to F at the inlets of the cooling pipes. The expansion devices determine the mass flow in each of the parallel cooling pipes; their upstream and downstream pressures are equal by the design of the feed and outlet pipework where the pressure drop is small. About one half of the latent heat of evaporation is used from F to G in the cooling pipes to which the SCT modules are attached. The remainder of the latent heat is used in the counter-current heat exchanger from G to H and for absorbing heat from power tapes and cables. The cold gas is heated to room temperature in the pipe run from the pit to the surface building, before entering into the compressor. Volumes on the constant-volume lines are given in units of litre/Mol, and entropies on the constant-entropy lines are given in units of JMol-1K-1.

Figure 4a: Pressure drop of C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) in circular 1.4 mm cooling pipes of 150 cm length used for cooling the 12 Barrel SCT modules in each row. The mass flow is adjusted so that one half of the available cooling (by the latent heat of evaporation) is used for absorbing the heat from the modules. The lower set of points give the frictional pressure drop for various input quality factors (=vapour fraction). The upper set of points give the total pressure drop which is the sum of the frictional pressure drop and the gas dynamic pressure drop due to the acceleration of the fluid following its expansion by evaporation. The solid line, presented for comparison, is the frictional pressure drop if the same mass flow of gas phase only passes through the pipe which is unheated.

Figure 4b: Pressure drop of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) in circular 4 mm cooling pipes under the same assumptions as for Fig. 4a). Because the two-phase flow correlations work rather poorly at pressures below atmospheric, and because the flow is marginally homogeneous, there is an apparent discrepancy between the gas-only pressure drop and the 2-phase pressure drop. The flow is likely to be intermittent and unstable.

Figure 6: Baker flow pattern regions for C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) and C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) in the cooling pipes under the conditions described in Figs. 4 and 5. The first fluid appears to undergo homogeneous flow, while the second enters the cooling pipe is slug flow when the quality factor is below 0.25.

Figure 7a: Taitel and Dukler flow pattern regions for C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) and C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) in the cooling pipes under the conditions described in Figs. 4 and 5. Both fluids appear to undergo homogeneous flow, however, the Froude parameter is known to describe the flow patterns poorly at pressures below atmospheric.

Figure 7b: Taitel and Dukler flow pattern prediction for bubbly flow. For C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) the diagram indicates that at the lowest quality factors the flow is close to homogeneous bubbly pattern, whereas for C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) the flow pattern is undetermined.

Figure 9: The heat transfer coefficient describing the relation between the heat flux and the temperature difference between the fluid and the pipe wall, for 3 cm long isothermal sections of the cooling pipes described in Fig. 4, heated by one module dissipating 5.45 W power all of which is transferred through the heated area. The lines are cubic spline fits to the points of the total heat transfer coefficient for the two fluids; the other points show the contributions of the forced-convection and nucleate-boiling heat transfer to the total heat transfer coefficient for the two fluids. It should be noted that the relationship between the heat flux and temperature difference is non-linear in two-phase heat transfer, and therefore the coefficient cannot be used as such in other geometries or for other heat fluxes.
