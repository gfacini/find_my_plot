###### Abstract

At the LHC, the single top quarks will be produced at a third of the rate of top quark pairs. With more than two million single top quark events produced every year during the low luminosity run, a precise determination of all contributions to the total single top quark cross section seems achievable. Comparison between the measured cross section and the theoretical prediction will provide a crucial test of the Standard Model. These measurements will lead to direct measurement of \(V_{\rm tb}\) at the few percent level of precision, and constitute a powerful probe for new physics, via the search for evidence of anomalous couplings to the top quark or the measurements of additional boson contributions to single top quark production.

The single top quark production mechanism proceeds through three different sub-processes resulting in distinct final states, topologies and backgrounds. Given the level of backgrounds affecting the individual selections and the importance of the systematic uncertainties, the use of sophisticated methods appears mandatory to unambigiously observe each process and determine precisely the corresponding cross sections. This report presents the methods developed to optimize the selection of single top quark events in the three channels and establishes the ATLAS potential for the cross section measurements for the early data period and for a 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) low luminosity run.

Introduction

The top quark is one of the key particles in the quest for the origin of particle mass. In particular the electroweak interaction of the top quark is sensitive to many types of new physics. The electroweak production of top quark leads to a final state of a single top quark plus other particles. The production cross section is sensitive to contributions from new particles such as new heavy bosons W\({}^{\prime}\) or charged Higgs bosons H\({}^{\pm}\). Other processes such as flavor-changing neutral currents also result in a single top quark final state [1]. Furthermore, single top quark production is an important background to many searches for new physics.

The D0 [2] and CDF [3] collaborations at the Fermilab Tevatron reported evidence for single top quark production and a first direct measurement of the CKM matrix element \(V_{\rm tb}\). This involved advanced analysis methods to extract the small single top quark signal out of the large backgrounds. The Tevatron experiments will collect several fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, and expect to not only observe single top quark production at the 5 sigma level but also separate two different production modes: the s-channel and the t-channel. However, the single top quark production cross section is small at Tevatron energies and single top quark measurements will be limited by statistics.

At the LHC, the number of signal events is not a problem anymore. The LHC will not only be a strong interaction top quark factory but will also produce several million single top quark events. The cross section for all three modes of single top quark production as well as the CKM matrix element \(V_{\rm tb}\) can be measured with high precision [4]. Once the single top quark signal has been established, detailed measurements of the process will follow, for example of the top quark polarization, ratios of cross sections, and charge asymmetries. Searches in each of the single top quark channels are sensitive to new physics even before the Standard Model single top quark signal is found. The D0 collaboration has published limits on W\({}^{\prime}\) boson production and flavor changing neutral currents [5, 6].

This paper describes the cross section measurements for the three single top quark production modes and is organized as follows: the single top quark phenomenology is introduced in Section 2. All studies are based on a common event preselection, presented in Section 3. The prospects for the cross section measurements for the t-channel, s-channel and Wt-channel are then presented in Sections 4, 5, and 6. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in Section 7.

## 2 Phenomenology and strategy for single top quark analyses in ATLAS

In the Standard Model single-top quark production is due to three different mechanisms: (a) W-boson and gluon fusion mode, which includes the t-channel contribution and is referred to as t-channel as a whole (b) associated production of a top quark and a W-boson, indicated as Wt-channel, and (c) s-channel production coming from the quark anti-quark annihilation. Among those channels, the dominant contribution comes from the t-channel processes which account for \(246^{+12}_{-12}\) pb [7, 8]. The Wt-channel contribution amounts to \(66\pm 2\) pb [9] while the s-channel mode is expected to have a cross section of \(11\pm 1\) pb [7, 8]. The cross sections are calculated at the next-to-leading Order (NLO) with an input top quark mass of 175 GeV. A 4.3 GeV uncertainty on the top quark mass is included in t-channel and s-channel cross section uncertainties, while the Wt-channel uncertainty includes strong energy scale variations only.

In the Standard Model, the top quark is assumed to decay almost exclusively into a W-boson and a b quark. The W-boson can then decay leptonically or hadronically. In the following, when discussing the analysis strategy in the s- and t-channels, only the leptonic decays of the W-boson are considered (lvb\(\bar{\rm b}\) and lvb\(\bar{\rm b}\)q final states, respectively)2. For the associated production (Wt-channel), only the modeswhere a lepton originating either directly from the W-boson produced together with the top quark or from the top quark decay are used. The \(\tau\) decay modes are included in all relevant samples and treated as a signal for leptonic \(\tau\) decays, since the signal selection is aimed at electron and muon signatures.

Top quark pair production constitutes a dominant background to single-top quark events. The LHC total production cross section computed at NLO with next-to-leading logarithmic resummations is \(\sigma(t\bar{t})=833\pm 100\) pb [10][11], about 3 times larger than the single top quark cross section, and more than 80 times that of the s-channel. Given the fact that single top quark final state topology is characterized by one high \(p_{\rm T}\) lepton, missing energy and jets, \(\rm t\bar{t}\) production represents a significant background in its lepton\(+\)jets decay mode, i.e. when one of the W's decays leptonically and the other hadronically (\(\rm t\bar{t}\to l\nu bjjb\)), with a final state containing two jets from the hadronization of b quarks and two jets from light quarks, a high \(p_{\rm T}\) lepton and missing energy. The "dilepton" channel (\(\rm t\bar{t}\to l\nu bllvb\)) where a lepton is lost in acceptance also constitutes a major background. Finally, top quark pairs with one or both W-boson(s) decaying into a \(\tau\) lepton where the \(\tau\) decays into an electron or a muon, may also survive the selection.

W\(+\)jets events constitute another major source of background because of a cross section several orders of magnitude above the one of the single top quark production. The Leading Order (LO) Alpgen [12] generator with the HERWIG [13] parton shower algorithm was used for the generation of W\(+\)jets and \(\rm Wb\bar{b}+\)jets events in this analysis. The corresponding LO cross-sections have also been used. A 20% uncertainty on the W\(+\)jets and \(\rm Wb\bar{b}+\)jets cross-sections is considered in the following. WW and WZ diboson processes were also studied using samples generated with the HERWIG generator. The corresponding cross-sections are reported in [10].

While QCD dijet and multijet processes do not have features of the signal, they contribute to the background due to their overwhelming cross section and small but finite rate of object misidentification. The estimation of this background needs to be done using data-driven methods and has been studied using full simulated dijet events generated with PYTHIA [14].

## 3 Single top quark event preselection

The three production modes of single top quark events are characterized by similar features that motivate a common set of preselection criteria. This preselection, which classifies the events according to exclusive electron and muon selections, is also aimed at reducing the level of three types of processes which constitute the main backgrounds to single top quark analyses: the top quark pair production, the W\(+\)jets and the QCD events.

### Triggering and event preselection

The triggers for single top quark events rest upon the use of the inclusive isolated electron and muon triggers. Their design and performance for the three levels of trigger are presented extensively elsewhere [15]. Triggering efficiency is 84\(\pm\)1% overall for top pair quark events. Only marginal differences are seen in single top events. Note that for fast simulation samples like W\(+\)jets datasets, where no trigger information is available, a trigger weight derived from turn on curves established on \(\rm t\bar{t}\) events is applied to every event.

Selected events must have at least one offline high \(p_{\rm T}\) isolated lepton in the central region with \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\). The isolation criterion requires that the energy in a cone of \(\Delta R\)\(=0.2\) around the lepton direction be less than 6 GeV and is important for the rejection of QCD background in which a jet can fake an electron or a muon [10]. Muons and electrons are required to have a transverse momentum greater than 30 GeV ensuring that the trigger efficiency is on the plateau and hence less sensitive to trigger uncertainties. Finally, the sign of the highest \(p_{\rm T}\) lepton gives the flavor of the decaying top quark.

The event must then pass a second isolated lepton veto cut, applied to any lepton with a \(p_{\rm T}\) above 10 GeV and in the pseudo-rapidity region \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\) in order to reduce contamination from dilepton backgrounds. The rejection of \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events in the dilepton channel is increased by a factor 2.5 as this requirement is applied. The impact on the signal efficiency is limited, with a loss of 3.6% in both the s- and t-channel and 2.7% in the Wt-channel.

Events are preselected if at least two jets are reconstructed with a \(p_{\rm T}\) above 30 GeV in the pseudo-rapidity region \(|\eta|\leq 5.0\). The \(\rm t\overline{t}\) production being the dominant background to single top quark analyses, the use of a jet veto appears mandatory. The event jet multiplicity is thus further required to be lower or equal to four, where the extra jets must be reconstructed with \(p_{\rm T}\) above 15 GeV. It is important to keep this threshold as low as possible, since lowering the veto \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold from 30 to 15 GeV results in a rejection of \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events increased from 5 to almost 10. Among those events, the \(\rm l+jets\) decay modes are the most sensitive to such a requirement with a rejection rate that is doubled compared to the 30 GeV threshold. Dilepton events are less affected with a rejection rate going from 5 to 6.6. This requirement results in a relative loss of 20 to 25% of the single top quark in the t- and Wt-channel channels and of 7% in the s-channel.

Among the highest \(p_{\rm T}\) jets, one at least must be b-tagged, have a \(p_{\rm T}\) above 30 GeV and be in the central pseudo-rapidity region \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\). The b-tagging algorithms are described elsewhere [10]. A cut on the b-tag weight corresponding to a 60% efficiency and a mistag rate of light jets of 100 [16] is used. The mistag rates being small, we use an additional method to estimate backgrounds which do not contain b partons in the final states but are present in the selected sample because of a cross section several orders of magnitude above that of the signal. This is the case for the W+jets production. In those events, each jet is assigned a tag weight based on the parametrization of the mistag rate as function of the jet pseudo-rapidity and transverse momentum. The combination of all jets results in a weight assigned to the event to be considered as a "1 b-tag inclusive", "2 b-tags" etc... event. Known as the "tagging rate function", this method, which applies on Monte Carlo events, improves the statistics in the distributions of such events, while keeping a global normalization corresponding to the actual mistag rates [17].

Finally the transverse missing energy is required to be larger than 20 GeV. This criterion is consistent with the leptonic decays of a W-boson while reducing the contamination from QCD events.

### Preselection efficiency

Preselection efficiencies as well as event yield for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) are reported in Table 1. The single top quark efficiency ranges between 5 and 6% in the electron channel and between 5.5 and 7.5% in the muon channel respectively. These numbers translate into a total of approximately 5,000 and 4,200 single top quark events in the muon and electron channel respectively including \(\tau\) decays.

The production of \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events constitutes the dominant source of background to single top quark analyses. The \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events in the \(\rm l+jets\)\((l=e,\mu)\) modes are selected with an efficiency lower than 5%, resulting in a total of 22,580 events. The \(\tau+1\) (and \(\tau\tau\)) modes also contribute significantly with about 6,000 expected events. Despite the use of a second lepton veto dilepton events, where a lepton escapes detection, also contribute to the preselected sample significantly with about 4,000 events surviving the selection. The production of W+jets events is also an important source of background, with about 13,000 events in the preselected sample. However these events populate mostly the lower jet multiplicity bin and their selection depends crucially on the mistag rates. The selection of \(\rm Wb\overline{b}+jets\) events results in about 1,000 events.

QCD events may also contribute to the selected sample of events. However, the requirements of the presence of at least one isolated identified lepton and one jet tagged as a b-jet reduce very significantly their level as discussed in [11]. Typically QCD background is expected to be smaller than the W+jets background. Further rejection may be achieved by applying more restrictive requirements on the lepton identification, or on the missing transverse energy and its correlation in \(\phi\) with reconstructed objects like leptons and jets [18]. The uncertainty on the remaining level of QCD background may be large. The QCD background contamination in selected samples should preferably be monitored, for example by the reconstruction of the transverse W-boson or top quark reconstructed masses [19].

### Cross-section determination and systematic uncertainties

Specific selections have been defined for the t-, s- and Wt- channels analyses. A general procedure to determine the cross-section on the selected samples and assess the errors associated to the measurement has been defined and is common to all three single top quark analyses. The following expression is used to calculate the cross section, \(\sigma\):

\[\sigma=\frac{N_{sig}}{a\times\mathcal{L}}=\frac{N_{tot}-B}{a\times\mathcal{L }}, \tag{1}\]

where \(N_{sig}\) and \(N_{tot}\) are the number of signal and all selected events respectively, \(B\) is the number of background events, \(a\) is the signal acceptance and \(\mathcal{L}\) is the luminosity of the data sample. In the following studies, these numbers are estimated using Monte Carlo samples only. Data driven methods are expected be used to estimate specific backgrounds in the forthcoming data analyses.

The propagation of the errors into the cross-section has been done in a consistent way among the three channels. They are combined and propagated to the measured cross section using a Monte Carlo method, which randomly generates \(N_{tot}\) according to a Poisson distribution, and varies randomly \(B\) and \(a\) for every systematic source by an amount chosen around its central value, according to a gaussian distribution. This procedure is performed a few thousand times and the RMS of the resulting distribution is interpreted as the total uncertainty.

The total uncertainty is calculated using a common procedure as described in Section 4.2.3 in the three individual analyses. The main sources of experimental systematic errors taken into account are the b-tagging efficiency, jet energy scale, luminosity, for which central values are provided in the corresponding sections. Theoretical uncertainties that have been considered are the errors on the background cross-sections, as well as the impact of the uncertainties in the parton distribution functions and the b-quark fragmentation in the selection efficiency. Note that we consider the errors as fully correlated between signal and background for jet energy scale, b-tagging, and luminosity.

## 4 Measurement of the t-channel cross section

The t-channel is the most promising channel for single top quark observation at the LHC. It has the largest theoretical cross section of the three channels and its event features give us reasonable visibility of the signal according to the studies done so far [20]. In addition to the cross section measurement, the t-channel single top quark is one of very few candidate channels for the \(V_{\rm tb}\) and the top quark polarization measurements. It is hoped that these measurements will shed light on our understanding of the electroweak symmetry breaking since these quantities have not been studied with high precision in past experiments. Compared to \(\rm\bar{t}\), the t-channel single top quark analysis suffers from a higher level of background due to its lower jet multiplicity, which makes the selection sensitive to QCD and W+jets backgrounds whose cross sections are several orders of magnitude higher than that of the signal. Thus, while the signal production rate is not statistically limited at the LHC, a good strategy for signal extraction is required and a careful estimation of the background rate is necessary.

### Cut based event selection

After the common preselection, the contribution from the background is still high mainly due to W+jets at the lower end of the kinematic distributions (such as in the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum) and \(\rm\bar{t}\) at the higher end. The b-tagged jets coming from \(\rm\bar{t}\)  and the t-channel single top quark tend to have high \(p_{\rm T}\) and to be located more centrally since they mainly originate from top quark decays. On the other hand, b-tagged jets from W-boson events are much softer as they primarily come from mistagged jets originating from extra gluon radiation. Furthermore, the recoiling forward quark in the t-channel single top quark produces a high \(p_{\rm T}\) light jet in the forward direction. This was found to be one of few features useful to reject \(\rm\bar{t}\)  background

Figure 1: Signal and background distributions of the b-tagged jet \(p_{\rm T}\) and multiplicity of jets with \(p_{\rm T}>\) 30 GeV after the t-channel selection.

events because light jets from the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) events are typically initiated from hadronic W-boson decays and are therefore more central. A cut on b-tagged jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>50\) GeV reduces the W+jets significantly, while a cut on the hardest light jet \(|\eta|>2.5\) can reject \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\). Figure 1 shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution of the hardest b-tagged jet and the composition of the sample in terms of the jet multiplicity after the additional event selection.

Table 2 lists the number of preselected events, the number of events selected after the cut on b-tagged jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the number after the light jet \(\eta\) cut for the signal and the background processes. The signal efficiency is 1.81% and the signal to background ratio after all selection is 37%. Note that the single top quark \(\tau\) decays are included in the signal count. By far the largest background contribution comes from the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) process; the \(\mathrm{l+jets}\) top quark pair events contribute the most, although dilepton events have a higher survival probability of 1.36% compared to 0.64% of the \(\mathrm{l+jets}\). W+jets is the second largest background while the \(\mathrm{Wb\bar{b}}\) contribution is relatively small. The s-channel single top quark contribution is almost negligible and the diboson background is even smaller and therefore is not included in the table.

As seen in Table 2, a precision (\(\sqrt{S+B}/S\)) of 5% can be obtained after the final selection. Note, however, that the selection cut does not optimize the precision nor the significance of the signal observation. From purely statistical arguments, the t-channel cross section can be measured to a few percent accuracy with a few \(\mathrm{fb^{-1}}\) of data.

In comparison to the previous study in the ATLAS physics TDR [20], which reported S/B a ratio of 3, there is a significant apparent reduction in the event selection performance. The cut-based selection used here is similar to that used in the TDR and we would have expected a similar result. Further investigation revealed several issues with the TDR analysis. Firstly, Monte Carlo (MC) generators changed drastically in recent years. PYTHIA introduced a new parton shower algorithm, which is much more radiative. The matrix-element generator for the signal has also changed to AcerMC, which combines the NLO diagram contribution to the LO ones as opposed to PYTHIA, which only uses LO. For the W+jets background production, Alpgen is used because it is shown that it reproduces better the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) tails of jet distributions at the TeVatron [21], while Herwig was used in the TDR. In addition, the TDR analysis did not include some of the crucial background processes, like dilepton \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\) channels and \(\tau\) decay modes which are shown to contribute significantly in the present analysis. Therefore, the result of the TDR can

now be seen as too optimistic.

Note that the presence of pile-up affects the reconstruction of the objects selected in the event. In particular, the selection efficiency is directly affected by the presence of extra jets in the events. Specific Monte Carlo samples of single top quark and events have been produced with or without pile-up events superimposed. The use of events with pile-up results in a decrease of about 25% for signal events, and 34% for events. No systematic uncertainties will be associated with this value. The use of data will be mandatory for the tuning of the pile-up modeling and the corresponding uncertainty is expected to be brought down to a negligible value with respect to the other sources of error.

### Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties have been evaluated following a procedure common to all three analyses. This procedure is defined here and the results specific to all analyses are reported in the corresponding sections.

#### 4.2.1 Experimental systematic uncertainties

Various criteria need to be considered to assess the systematic effects as it depends on a number of detector sub-components and theoretical assumptions. A general procedure has been defined to assess all systematic errors in a consistent way for the three single top quark analyses. The estimate is shown here for the t-channel analysis only.

The effect of the uncertainties on the measured cross section is summarized in Table 4. While the statistical uncertainty is not a constraint for the t-channel cross section analysis even with the early data, systematic uncertainties can only be reduced with detailed understanding of the detector performance and theoretical uncertainties. The measurement in the t-channel is largely limited by such effects.

The uncertainty in the b-tagging performance and jet energy scale can have crucial effects on the measured cross section since we rely on jet kinematics to reduce the background. In particular, the large background contribution from can cause a large fluctuation on the total event rate with these uncertainties, which leads to a large error on the cross section measured. The jet energy scale uncertainty affects the distribution of jets strongly at the low end of the distribution. Cutting on in this region can lead to a larger uncertainty on the signal acceptance. The effect of 5% variation of the b-tagging performance has been considered together with the corresponding change in the mistag rate of non b-tagged jets. The effect of a 5% change of the jet energy scale determination (JES) has also been evaluated

on the efficiency. The impact of both effects on the selection is summarized in Table 3. It should be noted that the Wb\(\bar{\rm b}\) and W\(+\)jets backgrounds are more affected by the jet energy scale due to the fact that most of the jets in these sample are in the low-\(p_{\rm T}\) region, which means that they are more likely to enter or leave the acceptance as the scale is changed.

The uncertainty due to the trigger requirements has been estimated by computing the variation in the signal and background rates resulting from a bias of 1% in the inclusive lepton trigger efficiency. This corresponds to the expected level of precision derived from turn on curves determination with the early data. Similarly, a 1% uncertainty in the lepton identification was considered and the corresponding impact on the cross section measurement assessed. These two effects are expected to contribute to less than 2% of the total uncertainty with 1fb\({}^{-1}\).

Note that for all those results, the limited statistics of the Monte Carlo samples may result in fluctuations in the variable distributions used to discriminate signal from background events. The uncertainty associated to the low statistics is found to be 6-8% with W\(+\)jets being the largest cotrigger requirements.

#### 4.2.2 Theoretical and Monte Carlo systematic uncertainties

Since the event selection relies heavily on the jet multiplicity, the number of additional jets from the parton shower can affect the selection efficiency. To evaluate the effect of ISR/FSR uncertainty, two sets of PYTHIA parameter variations were considered for comparison, which control the free parameters in the underlying event, initial- and final-state radiation, showering, and multiple interactions. The variations were combined to maximize the variation in the number of selected events to give a conservative estimate. The effect on the jet multiplicity is shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that the loose jet (\(p_{\rm T}\)\(>\) 15 \(GeV\)) distribution is affected more severely, which affects the selection efficiency due to the jet veto cut. The parameter variation set that gave the largest uncertainty leads to an overall uncertainty in the t-channel selection efficiency of \(-\)11% \(+\) 7%, and is quoted as a systematic uncertainty.

The uncertainty due to PDF was calculated using a re-weighting method together with error PDF sets provided by the PDF packages. While the event generation was done only for the central value PDF,

Figure 2: Variation in t-channel multiplicity for the loose (\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 15 GeV, left) and the tight (\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 30 GeV, right) jets due to ISR/FSR parameter variation. The distributions are shown without applying the t-channel selection cuts. The jet veto cut (\(\leq\) 4 loose jets) and the requirement of b-tagged jet were also removed for these plots to show the uncertainty over all multiplicities\({}^{4)}\). Black points are the nominal entries while the mesh band shows variation from “3/4 jet parameter set” and the filled band shows that of “2/3”, which are the two sets of parameter variations compared to study different jet multiplicity events.

weights were calculated in each event according to:

\[w_{i}^{\pm}=\frac{f_{1}(x_{1},Q;S_{i}^{\pm})\cdot f_{2}(x_{2},Q;S_{i}^{\pm})}{f_{ 1}(x_{1},Q;S_{0})\cdot f_{2}(x_{2},Q;S_{0})}, \tag{2}\]

where, \(f_{1}\) and \(f_{2}\) are the PDF values for a given hard scattering process (characterized by flavors \(f\) and momentum fractions \(x\) of the initial partons, and by \(Q\), the event energy scale) evaluated for the \(i^{th}\) error PDF pair \(S_{i}^{\pm}\). The variation in efficiency was calculated by applying an event selection similar to the preselection cuts at the generator level. The variations in efficiency were added using the Hessian formalism and the results from CTEQ and MRST PDF error sets [22][23] were consistent. The effect of the PDF uncertainty on the signal was evaluated to be +1.4% -1.1% and it is a minor contribution to the final systematics. A larger effect of +6.2% -5.5% was seen on the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) background. The PDF uncertainty was estimated for the leading contribution from the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) process only.

In addition to the above, the t-channel process has a fairly large uncertainty from MC generator predictions. Comparing various combinations of ME and PS generators, it was observed that the Pythia and Herwig parton shower algorithms give significantly different jet multiplicities. While we assume that this difference can be eliminated by tuning the parameters to the observed data5), the instability of theoretical prediction from matrix element generators is an outstanding issue and a 4.2% variation in signal acceptance was seen by comparing AcerMC+Herwig and MC@NLO+Herwig. We quote this as an estimate for systematic uncertainty from the theoretical prediction.

In our present analysis, the background is estimated from Monte Carlo and its normalization is currently estimated based on theoretical uncertainties. When data will be available, the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) and the W+jets backgrounds will be measured from data as well. It is beyond the scope of this paper to discuss methods for the data-driven background estimation and the uncertainty from the background is currently estimated based on theoretical uncertainties.

#### 4.2.3 Summary of uncertainties

A large part of the final uncertainty is due to the overwhelming amount of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background. For this reason, the event selection optimized for statistical significance or statistical precision does not give the smallest total uncertainty when systematics are included. Table 4 reports the uncertainties associated the cross section determination. The total uncertainty is dominated by systematic effects related to the background normalization. Reducing the background contamination to increase signal to background ratio would help to minimize the systematic uncertainty. It is therefore desirable to further optimize the selection beyond what can be achieved with simple cuts on the existing variables.

Note that for an analysis based on 10 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\), the table reports the expected performance assuming a better understanding of the experimental aspects of the detection. Assuming a b-tagging efficiency known with a precision of 3%, the jet energy scale determined at 1%, a luminosity known at 3% and a better understanding of the background to the 3% level and the radiation modeling at 3%, a total systematic uncertainty of 10% seems achievable for the BDT analysis.

### Multivariate event selection

In the cut-based analysis no variable was found that was effective to reject the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background. One commonly employed separation technique is a Multivariate Analysis (MVA), which effectively factorizes the process of cut optimization using a set of rules for separating the signal from the background events. In the present analysis, an attempt to eliminate the remaining background contribution from \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) makes use of the Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) method [25] within the TMVA [26] framework. The sample used is selected with the b-tagged jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut selection, without applying the forward jet \(\eta\) cut. This cut is indeed effective to reduce the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) contribution but not very efficient. About 40 object/event level variables were studied using a genetic algorithm, which scanned a large number of variable sets. Extensive studies of this variable sets revealed that a small subset of the variables can achieve signal to background discrimination close to what was achieved using all variables. This set was further refined so that the chosen variables are not too sensitive to JES systematics:

* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading b-tagged jet and non-b-tagged jet;
* \(\eta\) of the leading non-b-tagged jet and \(\cos\theta\) of the leading jet;
* Centrality (\(\frac{p_{T}^{\mu\pi 0}+p_{T}^{\mu\pi 1}}{|p|^{\mu\pi 0}+|p|^{\mu\pi 1}}\));
* Scalar sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the two highest energy jets, the transverse missing energy \(\not{E}_{\mathrm{T}}\), and the lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\);
* \(\Delta R\) between the two jets with the highest transverse momentum
* \(\Delta R\) between the leading jet and the lepton;
* \(\Delta R\) between the leading non-b-tagged jet and the lepton;
* the lepton, and the W-boson transverse mass;
* \(\eta\) of the jet with largest \(|\eta|\);
* the number of jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV.

Figure 3 (left) shows the BDT output discriminator constructed from the variables discussed above. By cutting on a high value of the discriminator, the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background can be removed more effectively than by cutting on individual input variables. Since the BDT was optimized for the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) separation, as expectedthe output is not effective against W+jets. It can be seen in the right figure that a high level of signal purification is achieved using the BDT discriminator.

We optimized the cut on the BDT output by minimizing the final uncertainty on the measured cross section, including the systematic effects. For each cut, the systematic uncertainties were calculated assuming that the relative systematic uncertainty stays constant for each channel for each source of uncertainty. This is a fairly reasonable assumption considering that the relative uncertainty changes slowly with the cuts and the variables were chosen to avoid larger systematics. For most cut values, the systematic effects are dominant and the total uncertainty is reduced with increasing signal to background ratio. On the other hand, with very tight cuts the statistical error becomes larger than systematics. The overall minimum was found to be at 0.6 where the signal to background ratio is 1.3 and 542 signal events are left as shown in Table 5. The reconstructed top mass distrubution after applying BDT selection is shown in figure 3 (right). The top mass was reconstructed from the lepton, \(\not{E}_{\rm T}\) and the highest \(p_{\rm T}\) b-tagged jet. The W-boson mass was constrained to be 80.4 GeV to obtain two solutions for neutrino kinematics and the one with the smaller \(pz\) was selected. The statistical uncertainty is 5.7% while the total uncertainty is 22% as shown in Table 4.

### Sensitivity at 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and the measurement of \(|V_{tb}|\)

Although the estimated systematic uncertainty of the cut-based analysis is rather large (44.7%), it has been shown that this can be reduced by rejecting the \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) background using boosted decision trees. The total uncertainty decreases as the \(S/B\) ratio increases and the estimated uncertainty at 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) is

\[\frac{\Delta\sigma}{\sigma}=\pm 5.7\%_{stat}\pm 22\%_{sys}=\pm 23\%\,. \tag{3}\]

The t-channel cross section is proportional to \(|f_{L}V_{\rm{tb}}|^{2}\), where the parameter \(f_{L}\) is the weak left-handed coupling and \(f_{L}=1\) in the Standard Model. In the theory predictions, the product \(|f_{L}V_{\rm{tb}}|^{2}\) is always set

Figure 3: Boosted decision tree output for signal and background after the b-tagged jet \(p_{\rm T}\) cut (left) and leptonic top quark mass distribution using cut on BDT output at 0.6 (right).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|r r r r r r|r} \hline Process & t-channel & s-channel & Wt-channel & \(\rm{t\bar{t}}\) & W+jets & \(\rm{Wb\bar{b}}\) & \(S/B\) \\ \hline \hline N(1fb\({}^{-1}\)) & 542 & 3 & 15 & 184 & 201 & 10 & 1.31 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

to unity. Thus, if one measures the cross section, and then divides by the theoretical cross section, one obtains a measurement of \(|V_{\rm tb}|^{2}\), making the Standard Model assumption that \(f_{L}=1\)[27].

The relative uncertainty on \(V_{\rm tb}\) is the relative uncertainty on \(|V_{\rm tb}|^{2}\) divided by two since \(\delta|V_{\rm tb}|/|V_{\rm tb}|=\delta|V_{\rm tb}|^{2}/2|V_{\rm tb}|^{2}\). However, there are additional systematic uncertainties in the \(V_{\rm tb}\) measurement due to the presence of the theoretical cross section in the denominator. Here, we quote the uncertainty calculated in [7], in which a theoretical uncertainty of \(+3.8~{}-4.1\%\) is reported including the contributions due to the strong scale, PDF and top quark mass uncertainties. We use the average of the positive and the negative uncertainties. Therefore, the estimated uncertainty on the measured value of \(V_{\rm tb}\) is

\[\frac{\Delta|V_{\rm tb}|}{|V_{\rm tb}|}=\pm 11\%_{stat+sys}\pm 4\%_{theo}=\pm 1 2\%. \tag{4}\]

### Summary

The cross section measurement of the single top quark t-channel was studied in this chapter. The characteristics of the signal and background were investigated in detail and an analysis strategy was developed first using simple cuts and then using boosted decision trees.

While a cut-based event selection can achieve a statistical precision of a few percent at an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), the tt background is difficult to reduce. This results in large systematic uncertainties coming from both experimental and theoretical origins. Uncertainties in the jet energy scale, b-tagging and luminosity all affect the measurement considerably. The uncertainty on the background cross section is also rather large though we expect that it will be constrained at higher accuracy with the data. This is also true for the QCD background, which is not included in our current analysis. The results shown are obtained on samples without any pile-up and no systematic uncertainty was associated to it. Data-driven background estimation methods should be developed once data is available. Among the theoretical issues, the ISR/FSR uncertainty degrades the measurement more significantly than other theoretical effects such as the PDF and the Monte Carlo generator model.

A multivariate background discrimination method is very effective in reducing the background and thus reducing the total uncertainty to nearly a half of the cut-based analysis. We conclude that multivariate analysis tools are highly effective for a t-channel cross section measurement and further studies of these techniques will be very beneficial for the improvement of the analysis in the future. However, to reach a precision at a few percent level, studies of systematic uncertainties and an excellent understanding of the detector response will be necessary.

## 5 Measurement of the s-channel cross section

The measurement of the single top quark s-channel appears the most delicate of the three main single-top quark processes. Suffering from a low cross section compared to the main backgrounds, the event topology makes this channel very sensitive to the presence of both tt and W+jets events. Because of the low jet multiplicity of such events, the analysis is also expected to be sensitive to dijet production, despite the tight requirements on the presence of at least two b jets. The s-channel is however one of the most interesting because the production of tb final state events is directly sensitive to contributions from extra W-bosons or charged Higgs bosons as predicted in two Higgs doublet model (2HDM) [28].

The event selection is presented in three steps. A first one makes use of a standard cut-based analysis, and will serve as a reference with the early data. In a second step, likelihood functions designed to improve the discrimination against specific backgrounds are presented together with the sets of discriminant variables that enter their definition. Finally, the selection criteria applied on those likelihoods are defined so that the total uncertainty affecting the cross section determination is minimized.

### Sequential cut analysis

After applying the common preselection described in Section 3, only two b-tagged jet events with \(p_{\rm T}\) above 30 GeV are selected, and a jet veto is applied on any other jet with a transverse momentum above 15 GeV. This strong requirement is used to reject \(\rm{\bar{t}}\) events which represent the dominant background to our signal at this stage. This set of requirements also reduces the W+jets and QCD multijet contamination, since those events feature much softer b jets or no b jets at all. The selection also requires the opening angle \(\Delta R\) between the two jets to be between 0.5 and 4.0, the scalar sum of total jet transverse momenta \(H_{\rm T}({\rm jet})\) to be above 80 and below 220 GeV and finally the sum of the transverse missing energy (\(\hbox to 0.0pt{/}E_{\rm T}\)) and lepton transverse momentum (\(p_{\rm T}\)) to be in the range between 60 and 130 GeV.

Selected event yields are reported in Table 6 for the three single top quark processes, and all \(\rm{\bar{t}}\) and \(\rm{W}\)+jets backgrounds. When adding all contributions, the overall signal efficiency is about 1.1% in the electron channel and 1.6% in the muon channel. This corresponds to a total of about 25 selected candidates for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). The signal to background ratio is about 10%. The dominant background is composed of the \(\rm{\bar{t}}\) events which account for about 60% of the total background yield. Among those, the \(\rm{\bar{t}}\) in the lepton+jets mode, including \(\tau\) decays, contribute about 40%. The remaining backgrounds originate from the \(\rm{Wb\bar{b}}\)+jets production, which constitutes about 14% of the background yield, and almost equally from the single top quark t-channel (11%) and \(\rm{W}\)+jets (9%) events. As expected, \(\rm{W}\)+jets events are removed due to the requirement of b-tagged jets, with a final yield depending upon the mistag rate. Diboson contributions (WW and WZ) are found to be negligible.

### Likelihood selection

The cut based analysis shows that a simple approach to select single top quark s-channel events is hampered by a high level of background. The use of a likelihood discriminator is aimed at improving the performance of the discrimination against backgrounds in order to purify the selected signal samples. This approach assumes that the distributions entering the definition of likelihood functions are well known

and validated on data itself. This result can be achieved by cross-checking at every step the agreement between data and Monte Carlo distributions on selected sub-samples where a high level of \(\mathrm{\tilde{t}\tilde{t}}\) and W+jets background is expected. In the following, only pre-selected events with exactly two jets, both of which are b tagged are considered. A jet veto on any other jet is applied.

#### 5.2.1 Definition of the likelihood functions

The main background processes to our signal show very distinct features in the final state and topology that lead us to define several likelihood functions each devoted to the discrimination of a specific process: three likelihood functions are devoted to \(\mathrm{\tilde{t}\tilde{}}\) events in the dilepton, the \(\mathrm{l}+\tau\) and the \(\mathrm{l}+\)jets decay modes and two likelihood functions have been developed to discriminate against W+jets and t-channel events. Due to the limited Monte Carlo statistics, these likelihood discriminators have been defined by combining both muon and electron channels.

The list of variables entering a likelihood function is derived from a procedure of optimization that selects only the variables that bring a significant discrimination between signal and the considered background. The discriminating power of a given variable is computed using the selection efficiencies for both signal and background in the plane \((\epsilon_{S},\epsilon_{B})\). When the discriminating power of a variable is low, the variation of the background efficiency \(\epsilon_{B}\) follows that of the signal \(\epsilon_{S}\). On the contrary, a high discriminating variable results in a larger decrease of \(\epsilon_{B}\) compared to the variation seen in \(\epsilon_{S}\). This variation, computed for each \(\epsilon_{S}\) and integrated over the full range of \(\epsilon_{S}\) can thus be seen as an estimator of the discriminating power of the variable. In this analysis, the variable is selected if the discriminating power is about a few percent. The use of higher thresholds results in a degradation of the performance due to the loss of discriminating power of the formed likelihoods. The set of discriminant variables is built from 16 relevant kinematical variables:

* the opening angles between the lepton and the jets \(\Delta R(l,b_{1}),\;\Delta R(l,b_{2})\)
* the angles \(\cos\Delta\Phi(l,b_{1})\) and \(\cos\Delta\Phi(l,b_{2})\);
* the opening angle between the two b tagged jets \(\Delta R(b_{1},b_{2})\);
* the pseudo-rapidity of the b tagged jets \(\eta_{\mathrm{b1}}\) and \(\eta_{\mathrm{b2}}\);
* the invariant mass formed by the systems of the two b tagged jets \(M_{\mathrm{inv}}(b_{1},b_{2})\)
* the invariant mass formed by the reconstructed \(W\) leptonic boson and the b tagged jets \(M(W_{\mathrm{lep}},b_{1})\) and \(M(W_{\mathrm{lep}},b_{2})\);
* the transverse momentum of the reconstructed top quark candidates \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\;(top_{1})\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\;(top_{2})\)
* the sum of the missing transverse energy and lepton transverse momentum \(\not{E}_{\mathrm{T}}+p_{\mathrm{T}}\;(l)\);
* the transverse mass of the leptonic W-boson candidate \(M_{\mathrm{T}}(W_{\mathrm{lep}})\);
* the scalar sum of the jet transverse momenta \(H_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathit{jets})\);
* global event shape variables: sphericity, aplanarity and centrality.

#### 5.2.2 Optimization of the likelihood selection

The likelihood function distributions corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Figure 4. Thresholds have been applied on each of the 5 likelihood values. In the present analysis, the thresholds on the likelihood values have been set so that the total uncertainty affecting the cross section measurement is minimized. The total uncertainty was calculated as described in Section 4.2.3. The main sources of systematic errors taken into account are the b-tagging efficiency, jet energy scale, luminosity and uncertainties on the background level, for which central values are provided in Section 5.3. Note that we consider the errors as fully correlated between signal and background for jet energy scale, b-tagging, and luminosity.

The thresholds set on the five likelihood outputs resulting from the minimization of the total uncertainty are listed below:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{\tilde{t}/lepton+jets}}>0.34,\] \[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{\tilde{t}/\mathrm{dilepton}}}>0.56,\] \[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{\tilde{t}/\mathrm{\tau+lepton}}}>0.80,\] \[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{W+jets}}>0.32,\] \[\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{t-channel}}>0.46\]

Table 7 reports the number of events expected for all signal and backgrounds for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). The overall signal to background ratio is improved significantly compared to the sequential cuts analysis with a purity increased from 9.8% to 18.7%. This is an expected outcome of the optimization procedure since the main source of errors comes from the uncertainties in the background.

The dominant background comes from \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\)  production, which contributes about 60% of the total event yield. Among those events, the main contribution originates from the \(1+\tau\) decay modes (\(\mathrm{l}{=}e,\mu\)), which corresponds to 45% of the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\)  yield, followed by the dilepton and the \(\mathrm{l}{+}\mathrm{jets}\) channels. The production of \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}{+}\mathrm{jets}\) represents about 20%, while the \(\mathrm{W}{+}\mathrm{jets}\) events still contribute 16% of the total background yield. Finally, the contamination originating from the other single top quark channels is smaller than the signal expected event yield with a contribution of 4% from the sum of \(\mathrm{t}\)- and \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{t}\)- channels. The results show a similar statistical sensitivity compared to the standard cut-based analysis, with an improved signal to background ratio.

As described in Section 4.1 the presence of pile-up affects the reconstruction of the objects selected in the event. The use of events with pile-up results in a decrease of about 9% for signal events, and 15% for \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\)  events. No systematic uncertainty is associated to this difference, as \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\)  events completely dominate the selected sample. Dedicated studies with data will be used to tune all Monte Carlo generators.

### Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties have been evaluated on the likelihood analysis. We follow the procedures defined in Section 4.2.

#### 5.3.1 Experimental systematic uncertainties

The uncertainties on the b-tagging efficiency and the mistag rates have been estimated by varying the b weight cut value corresponding to a change of \(\pm\)5% in the b-tag efficiency with respect to the reference value of 60%. Table 8 shows the impact of such effects on signal and background events. As the b-tag efficiency is varied by +5% and -5%, the signal selection efficiency is shifted by 7.1% and -7.7% respectively. For background events, the impact of such variations result in both cases in an increase of the background level which reaches +15% and +5% respectively because of the change affecting the mistag rates. Table 9 reports the impact on the total cross-section determination. The understanding of the b-tagging performance completely drives the analysis strategy.

A variation of -5% and +5% of the jet energy scale has been propagated to the jet reconstruction and the selection efficiencies were re-assessed. Backgrounds change by about 6% and 3% respectively, while the signal acceptance is found to vary by about \(\pm\)10%. Again, in both cases the background is

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r r r r} \hline Events in 1\(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) & b-tag -5\% & b-tag +5\% & JES -5\% & JES +5\% \\ \hline \hline s-channel & 14.2 (-7.7\%) & 16.5( +7.1\%) & 16.9 (+9.7\%) & 15.4 (negl.) \\ \hline \(\mathrm{t}\) and \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{t}\)-channel & 6.9 (+97\%) & 3.5 (negl.) & 5.1 (+45\%) & 5.1 (+45\%) \\ \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\)  combined & 47.8 (-1.6\%) & 58.1 (+19.5\%) & 49.5 (+1.8\%) & 46.9 (-3.5\%) \\ \(\mathrm{W}\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}{+}\mathrm{jets}\) & 15.5 (-8.8\%) & 16.4 (-3.5\%) & 17.0 (negl.) & 17.0 (negl.) \\ \(\mathrm{W}{+}\mathrm{jets}\) & 17.0 (+26\%) & 17.0 (+26\%) & 15.4 (+14\%) & 15.1 (+11.8\%) \\ \hline Total bkg & 87.2 (+5.4\%) & 94.9 (+14.8\%) & 87.7 (+6\%) & 84.9 (+2.6\%) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

increased with any change of the jet energy scale. Indeed, as the jet scale factor is decreased, top quark pair events in the dilepton and l+jets modes tend to have a lower multiplicity, resulting in an increased contamination. As the scale factor goes up, the low multiplicity events are favored while top quark pair production is almost not affected. Table 8 shows the effects of the jet energy scale variation on the signal and background event yield.

The impact of the trigger efficiency and lepton identification uncertainties has been estimated as explained in the t-channel Section. This reflects as an uncertainty of 6% on the total cross-section measurement. Table 9 reports the impact on the total cross-section determination.

#### 5.3.2 Theoretical and Monte Carlo systematic uncertainties

In the present analysis, uncertainties on the background estimates come from the theoretical uncertainties associated with their cross section. The main background contributions are \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\)  (60%), \(\mathrm{Wb\bar{b}+jets}\) (20%) and \(\mathrm{W+jets}\) (16%), so 10% uncertainties on the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\)  cross-section prediction and 20% on the \(\mathrm{W+jets}\) and \(\mathrm{Wb\bar{b}+jets}\) events lead to a total of 10.3% uncertainty on the total background. The understanding of the background level is thus a crucial point for a precise cross-section determination. Note that despite very distinct topologies, the selections of the s-, t- and Wt- channels analyses are not orthogonal. However it is believed that correlations can be properly addressed with dedicated study and enough statistics.

The selection of a 2-jet final state is very sensitive to the presence of extra jets originating from gluon radiation. Any uncertainty in the ISR/FSR modeling is thus expected to have a significant impact on the selection efficiencies, in particular for the s-channel and the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\)  events. Specific Monte Carlo samples have been generated with ISR/FSR settings leading to the largest cross section variations. Variations of 5% of the signal selection efficiencies are expected, and are due to the change in the jet multiplicity. The uncertainties however reach large values for the \(\mathrm{t\bar{t}}\)  production, with variations of 17.8% between the two extreme cases. Note that these variations have been assessed with non-calibrated jets, although there is a high expected correlation between jet energy scale and ISR/FSR gluon modeling. An overall

\end{table}
Table 9: Summary of all uncertainties that affect the measured cross section. Data statistics is the Poisson error one would expect from real data while MC Statistics is the uncertainty on the estimated quantities due to MC statistics.

9% uncertainty corresponding to half the variation is quoted. Note that the s-channel being produced via quark-antiquark annihilation, some constraints coming from the use of W-boson events should allow the tuning of the showering interfaces.

Another uncertainty is related to the choice of the PDFs. The procedures used to assess the impact of such choice is presented in Section 4.2.2. The expected bias on the signal is below 3% while this number is below 2% for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events.

Finally the effect of the b-fragmentation parametrization has also been investigated using fast simulation. The b quark fragmentation is performed according to the Peterson parametrization, with one free parameter \(\varepsilon_{b}\). Varying the default value from \(\varepsilon_{b}=-0.006\) by \(\pm 0.0025\)[29] and taking the difference as a systematic uncertainty leads to a change of 3.6% in the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) and signal selection efficiencies.

Table 9 lists all sources of uncertainties and reports their impact on the cross-section determination. Two cases are considered: one defined by the level of uncertainty in the b-tagging, JES, luminosity that will presumably characterize the early data taking period and a second one assuming a reasonable improvement on those effects with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). The assumptions made in the latter case are the same as the ones listed in Section 4.2.3.

### Summary

The determination of the s-channel cross section constitutes a challenging measurement, due to the presence of large backgrounds from the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production and from the W\(+\)jets channels. With an expected signal to background ratio of 18% the measurement will be hampered not only by a significant statistical uncertainty but also by the systematic effects affecting both signal and background. The measurement with an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) is thus both statistically and systematically limited, with about 60% of statistical and 90% of systematic uncertainties.

Given the present limitation on the background knowledge, early measurements will have to be devoted to the understanding of the background, in terms of shape and absolute normalization. For this purpose, specific studies performed on enriched background samples can be used. In this area, the knowledge of the effects of the ISR/FSR gluon radiation will need dedicated studies, in particular in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events. The constraint from data itself will thus be very important, and a tuning _a la_ CDF [30] will be crucial for the understanding of these radiations. From the detector side, a reliable cross-section measurement requires a good knowledge of the b-tagging tools performance, since double-tag events are considered. A good determination of the jet energy scale is also mandatory for the selection, at the level of better than 5%. PDF and b-fragmentation effects are expected to have a significant impact only at higher luminosity.

In this context, the use of sophisticated statistical methods appears mandatory to discriminate the signal from the background and to establish convincing evidence for a signal. Their use however requires an a priori good understanding of the background normalization and shapes. With an improved situation for the b-tagging and jet energy scale, with a background normalization determined from the data and a better ISR/FSR knowledge, evidence at 3 \(\sigma\) should be achievable with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 6 Measurement of the Wt-channel cross section

The Wt-channel is characterized by the associated production of a top quark and a W-boson. At the LHC, this single top quark process is the second highest cross-section after t-channel production, with an expected cross section of 66 pb. The final state features two W-bosons and a b jet, making this channel experimentally very close to top quark pair production, from which it differs by the absence of a second b jet in the final state. With a cross section 15 times larger than the Wt-channel processes, top quark pair events will thus constitute the dominant source of backgrounds and drive the definition of the selection criteria in higher jet multiplicity events. On the other hand, low jet multiplicity events will suffer from W+jets contamination. In this report, we consider only the case where one of the two bosons decays into leptons while the other decays into jets. Two approaches have been used to estimate the sensitivity to the Wt-channel cross section measurement: a sequential cut-based analysis, which will provide reference numbers, and an analysis based on the use of Boosted Decision Trees.

### Sequential cuts analysis

The common preselection defined for all three single top quark processes has been extended further to account for the specific topology of Wt-channel events. Selected events must have exactly one high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) b-tagged jet above 50 GeV. A veto on any other b tagged jet above 35 GeV is applied in order to reject \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\overline{t}}\) events. This b-tag veto utilizes a looser b-tag weight cut which has been optimized according to the signal over \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\overline{t}}\) background ratio: a ratio of 18% is reached in 2- and 3- jet final states events while 14% is found in 4-jet events. The corresponding efficiency is about 30% on signal events and 10% on \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\overline{t}}\) events. For events containing more than three high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets, the selection requires that the invariant mass of the two highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) non b-tagged jets to be between 50 and 125 GeV. The number of selected events is reported in Table 10 for signal and backgrounds.

In two jet events (labeled as '1b1j'), the signal yield is about 430 signal events for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), with a signal to background ratio of 6.8%, combining both electron and muon channels. The W+jets production is the dominant background with more than 45% of the total background yield. The \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\overline{t}}\) contamination in the l+jets channel constitutes about 20% of the background, while the other \(\mathrm{\mathrm{t}\overline{t}}\) modes combined contribute 11%. In this low jet multiplicity bin, the single top quark t-channel contamination is significant and represents 19% of the total.

In the three jet final state events (labeled as '1b2j'), 160 signal events are expected in 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), with a signal to background ratio close to 15%. In this final state, the use of the hadronic W boson mass

\begin{table}

constraint helps improve the rejection of W+jets and the other single top quark events. The background is made up of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events which represent 70% of the total background yield, and of about 20% of W+jets events. Among the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events, the \(\mathrm{l+jets}\) mode is dominant and constitutes about 85% of the total.

The four jet final state events (labeled as '1b3j') only bring a marginal improvement to the analysis. The number of expected Wt-channel single top quark events is small and expected to be 40 for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) with a signal to background ratio of 10.6%. In this high jet multiplicity bin, the main background comes from the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events in the \(\mathrm{l+jets}\) mode, which constitute 64% of the background. The rest originate mostly from the single top quark t-channel and from W+jets events, each being of the same order as the signal.

### Boosted decision tree analysis

As in the s-channel analysis, several multivariate discriminators have been defined to optimize the discrimination against backgrounds. Two Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) functions are defined to separate signal and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events, one devoted to the discrimination from the dominant \(\mathrm{l+jets}\) channel \(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{t\overline{t}}/\mathrm{l+jets}}\), and the other against the dilepton channels \(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{t\overline{t}}/\mathrm{dilepton}}\) including \(\tau\)'s. A function \(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{W+jets}}\) has been formed to separate signal from the W+jets sample, defined as the total contribution from light and heavy flavor jets. Another BDT discriminator is devoted to the separation of the signal and the single top quark t-channel events \(\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{t-channel}}\). The analysis being based upon events with jet multiplicity between two and four, specific BDTs have been defined in each jet multiplicity bin for each background. The electron and muon channels are being treated in a combined way, thus leading to the definition of 3 (jet multiplicity) x 4 (background) ie: 12 BDT discriminators in total.

#### 6.2.1 Definition of the discriminant variables

The set of discriminant variables is derived from the same procedure of optimization as the one explained for the s-channel analysis. The final set of discriminant variables is built from 25 relevant kinematical variables:

* the opening angles between the lepton and the jets \(\Delta R(l,b),\;\Delta R(l,j_{1})\), \(\Delta R(l,j_{2})\) where \(j_{1}\), \(j_{2}\) and \(j_{3}\) are the non b-tagged \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ordered jets
* the opening angle between the jets \(\Delta R(b,j_{1})\), \(\Delta R(b,j_{2})\), \(\Delta R(j_{1},j_{2})\);
* the angles \(\cos\Delta\Phi(j_{1},j_{2})\) and the pseudo-rapidity of the non b-tagged jets \(\eta_{\mathrm{j2}}\) and \(\eta_{\mathrm{j3}}\);
* the invariant mass formed by the sum of all jets \(M_{inv}(jets)\) and by the reconstructed W-boson and top quark candidates \(M(W+t)\);
* the mass of the hadronic W-boson candidate \(M(W_{\mathrm{had}})\);
* the sum of the missing transverse energy and lepton transverse momentum \(\not{E}_{\mathrm{T}^{+}}\,p_{\mathrm{T}}(l)\);
* the transverse mass of the leptonic W-boson candidate \(M_{\mathrm{T}}(W_{\mathrm{lep}})\)
* the transverse mass of the systems formed by the b jet and the reconstructed W-bosons \(M(b,W_{\mathrm{had}})\) and \(M(b,W_{\mathrm{lep}})\);
* the scalar sum of the jet transverse momenta \(H_{\mathrm{T}}(jets)\) and of all objects in the events \(H_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathrm{tot})\);
* the transverse jet momenta \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\;(b),\;p_{\mathrm{T}}(j_{1}),\;p_{\mathrm{T}}(j_{2})\);
* the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino solution computed with the top quark mass;* the global event shape variables, sphericity, aplanarity and centrality.

The BDT output distributions associated to each of the four backgrounds are represented in Figure 5 for the 3 jet final state analysis for the electron+muon channels for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\).

#### 6.2.2 Results with the Boosted Decision Trees

Several selections can be designed, allowing for different levels of signal purity. In this analysis as in the s-channel, the cuts on the discriminant BDTs have been set so that the total uncertainty affecting the cross section measurement is minimized.

Figure 5: Distributions for the four BDT defined in the 3 jet (’1b2j’) final state analysis. a) BDT against \(\ttbar\) in the ‘1+jets’ channel; b) BDT against W+jets events; c) BDT against \(\ttbar\) in the dilepton lepton (+tau) channel; d) BDT against single top quark t-channel events.

The thresholds set on the three BDT outputs are:

\[\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ttlj}}>0.6\] \[\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{ttlr}}>-0.36\] \[\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{Wjet}}>0.30\] \[\mathcal{D}_{\mathrm{t-chan}}>0.18\]

The number of events for signal and the different backgrounds is reported in Table 11 for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). In two jet events ('1b1j'), the signal yield is about 60 with a signal to background ratio of 35%, combining electron and muon analyses. This result represents an improvement by a factor 6 compared to the cut-based analysis. This feature is important since one of the main sources of systematic uncertainty originate from the imperfect knowledge of the background levels. Regarding the composition of the background, the W+jets production constitutes the dominant background and contributes 58% of the background yield. \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production in the 1+jets mode represents about 40% of the total. The only remaining single top quark events originate from the t-channel  which accounts for 6% of the total background yield. The statistical significance for this final state analysis alone is 4.5\(\sigma\).

In three jet final state events ('1b2j'), about 20 signal events are expected with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), with a signal to background ratio of 46%. Again, one notices a gain of more than a factor 3 compared to the cut-based analysis. The background events are made up almost exclusively (95%) of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events in the lepton+jets events. The use of the jet-jet invariant mass reduces the W+jets background to a few percent. The selection in this final state alone provides a signal statistical significance of 3.1 \(\sigma\).

In the four jet final state channel ('1b3j'), the number of expected Wt-channel single top quark events is 7 with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). In this bin, the signal to background ratio is about 36%, which corresponds to a gain of a

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r} \hline Events in 1fb\({}^{-1}\) & 2 jet (1b1j) & 3 jet (1b2j) & 4 jet (1b3j) \\ \hline \hline Wt-channel & 58.0 \(\pm\) 5.8 & 20.9 \(\pm\) 3.5 & 6.6 \(\pm\) 2.0 \\ \hline t-channel & 10.2 \(\pm\) 4.2 & negl. & 1.7 \(\pm\) 1.7 \\ s-channel & 1.4 \(\pm\) 0.3 & negl. & negl. \\ \(t\bar{t}\to all\,jet\) & negl. & negl. & negl. \\ \(t\bar{t}\to l+jet\) & 56.3 \(\pm\) 8.2 & 41.8 \(\pm\) 6.3 & 13.7 \(\pm\) 3.4 \\ \(t\bar{t}\to dilepton\) & 1.7 \(\pm\) 1.2 & negl. & negl. \\ \(t\bar{t}\to l+\tau\) & negl. & negl. & negl. \\ W+jets & 92.1 \(\pm\) 8 & 3.2 \(\pm\) 1.4 & 0.2 \(\pm\) 0.1 \\ Wb\(\mathrm{\bar{b}}\)+jets & 3.9 \(\pm\) 3.9 & negl. & negl. \\ \hline Total bkg & 165.6 \(\pm\) 9.2 & 45.1 \(\pm\) 6.3 & 15.6 \(\pm\)3.4 \\ \hline \(S/B\) & 35.0\% & 46\% & 36.2\% \\ \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & 4.5 & 3.1 & 1.7 \\ \(\sqrt{S+B}/S\) & 0.25 & 0.39 & 0.71 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

factor 4 compared to the sequential cut analysis. In this jet multiplicity bin, the only competing processes is the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events in the \(\mathrm{l+jets}\). The signal significance remains small, around 1.7\(\sigma\) with a corresponding statistical precision of 72%.

The effect of pile-up has been investigated with signal and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) samples produced with a pile-up corresponding to a 10\({}^{32}\) cm\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) luminosity run. The results show decreases of 18%, 47% and 26% of the signal event yield in the 2, 3 and 4 jet final states. For backgrounds, similar variations of 16%, 39% and 20% in the 2, 3 and 4 jet final states are seen. As expected the increase of the number of light jets seen in the events directly impacts the tight selection of 2- and 3- jet final states. No systematic uncertainty is associated to this effect, as for the two previous analyses, as only dedicated studies using data itself will be used to tune all Monte Carlo signal and background generators.

### Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties have been evaluated on the BDT analysis. We follow the procedures defined in Section 4.2.

#### 6.3.1 Experimental systematic uncertainties

The b-tagging uncertainties affect the Wt-channel selection because of the requirement of one b-tagged jet on one side, and the use of a veto for any second b tagged jet on the other side. The variation by 5% of the b tagging efficiency and the corresponding mistag rate results in a 7% change of the signal selection efficiency in the 2 jet final state. The sensitivity is higher in the higher multiplicity bins, with effects of 10% seen in the 3 jet bin. Regarding backgrounds, the impact of this uncertainty increases with the jet multiplicity, with \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events being the dominant background. Variations of 3% and 5% are seen respectively in 3 jet and 4 jet final states. Table 12 reports the relative changes in signal and background events. Table 13 reports the impact on the total cross section determination, all final states combined.

The precise knowledge of the jet energy scale is important for the Wt-channel analysis because of the requirements made on the mass reconstruction and \(\mathrm{\mbox{$p_{T}$}}\) thresholds used to select jets. A 5% variation

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|r r r} \hline Process & Events in 1\(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) & b-tag \(\pm\) 5\% & JES \(\pm\) 5\% \\ \hline \hline
2-jet events & & & \\ - signal & 58.0 & \(\pm\) 7.0\% & \(\pm\)0.5\% \\ - total bkg & 165.6 & \(\pm\) 3.0\% & \(\pm\)3.1\% \\ \hline
3 jet events & & & \\ - signal & 20.9 & \(\pm\)10.1\% & \(\pm\)7.0\% \\ - total bkg & 45.1 & \(\pm\)3.2\% & \(\pm\)3.0\% \\ \hline
4 jet events & & & \\ - signal & 6.6 & \(\pm\)3.1\% & \(\pm\)7.9\% \\ - total bkg & 15.6 & \(\pm\)5.1\% & \(\pm\)4.0\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 12: Effect of the b-tag efficiency and mistag rate variation and of the jet energy scale variation on the number of expected events for an integrated luminosity of 1 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) expected from the BDT analysis.

of the jet energy scale has been propagated to the jet reconstruction and the selection efficiencies are re-assessed. Table 12 shows the impact of the jet energy scale variation on signal and background event yields. In two jet events, the effects of the scale variation is about 1% on the signal events and 3% on the sum of all backgrounds. In three jet events a variation of 7% of the signal event yield is observed, with a change of 3% in the backgrounds. In four jet events, variations of 8% and 4% are seen in signal and background respectively. Table 13 reports the impact on the total cross section determination.

An uncertainty of 1% in the lepton identification or in the trigger efficiency would impact the number of selected events. Such an uncertainty would reflect in an uncertainty of 2.6% on the total cross section measurement, which is negligible with respect to the others.

#### 6.3.2 Theoretical and Monte Carlo uncertainties

Uncertainties on the background estimates come from the theoretical uncertainties associated to the cross sections. An uncertainty of 10% is quoted for the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events while 20% is associated to the W+jets and W\(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\)+jets events. This translates into a total of 12.5% in the 2 jet final state and 10% in the higher jet multiplicity bins where \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events completely dominate the background. Note that despite very distinct topologies, the selections of the Wt- and the t- channels analyses are not orthogonal. However it is believed that correlations can be properly addressed.

The selection of a low jet multiplicity final state is very sensitive to the presence of extra jets originating from gluon radiations. Any uncertainty in the ISR/FSR modelling is thus expected to have a significant impact on the selection efficiencies, in particular for the Wt-channel and top quark pair events. We quote an overall 9% uncertainty due to the modelling of gluon radiation in the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events.

The uncertainties in the PDF may affect the topologies as well as the momentum distributions of the final state objects, hence impacting the determination of the selection efficiency for both signal and backgrounds. The procedure to estimate the impact of the choice of the PDF to the selection efficiency is

Data statistics is the Poisson error one would expect from real data while MC Statistics is the uncertainty on the estimated quantities due to MC statistics. (*) background to 2j (12.5%) and 3j and 4j final states (10%)detailed in Section 4.2.2. Complete studies have been performed in each final state and a 2% uncertainty is quoted for signal and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events.

Finally the effect of the b-fragmentation parametrization has also been investigated following a similar procedure of that defined in Section 5.3.2 from fast simulation. The relative uncertainties of the different channel and final state selection efficiencies due to the b-fragmentation uncertainty is found to be 3.6%.

Table 13 lists all sources of uncertainties and reports their impact on the cross section determination. Two cases are considered: one defined by the level of uncertainty in the b-tagging, jet energy scale and luminosity that will presumably characterize the early data taking period; another assuming reasonable improvements on those effects with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). The assumptions made in the latter case are listed in Section 4.2.3.

### Summary

The determination of the Wt-channel cross section constitutes a challenging measurement with the early data, due to the presence of important \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) and W+jets backgrounds. This measurement makes use of the events with a jet multiplicity between two and four jets. With a signal to background ratio of about 30-40%, the analysis requires a good knowledge of the W+jets production in the lower multiplicity bins, and of the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) process in higher bins. The estimates of the shapes and normalization of those processes will have to rely upon the use of data. Strategies exist for QCD and W+jets events, but the discrimination against \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events remains a challenge.

As for the t-channel single top quark analysis, the cross section determination will very early be dominated by systematic uncertainties. The dominant effect is constituted by the background uncertainties, followed by the modeling of the gluon radiation. From the detector side, the dominant source of uncertainty is the b-tagging because of the imperfect knowledge of the b-tag and b-tag veto efficiencies as well as of the mistag rates. Another source is the determination of the jet energy scale, which affects the reconstruction of the W-boson mass and all the jet energies used in the analysis. Note that the determination of the luminosity to better than 5% is required in order to ensure a good measurement, or the use of ratio of different Wt-channel final states [31] can be used as well with higher luminosity. A 3 \(\sigma\) evidence can be reached with a few fb\({}^{-1}\) of data taking and a precision of 20% on the cross section measurement is achievable with about 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) provided that improvements are made in both the experimental aspects of the detection (backgrounds from data, b-tagging, jet energy scale and luminosity) and from the theoretical side.

## 7 Conclusion

At the LHC the production of single top quark events accounts for about a third of the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production, which leads to about 2.5 million events per year during a run at \(10^{32}\mathrm{cm^{2}s^{-1}}\). Similarly to the situation at the Tevatron, the selection of single top quark events will suffer from the presence of both W+jets and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) backgrounds, which are produced at much higher rates. Thus, careful approaches devoted to the understanding of these backgrounds in terms of shape and normalization performed directly from data will have to be defined. Besides, except for the s-channel, single top quark analyses will be very early dominated by the systematic uncertainties, and will require a good control of b-tagging tools and a reliable determination of the jet energy scale.

In a context of low signal over background ratio, the use of sophisticated tools like genetic algorithms, likelihoods and Boosted Decision Trees appears very useful if one wants to establish the signal or to determine its cross section precisely. These techniques, which are now in common use at the Tevatron, will require the use of reliable event samples for modeling signal and backgrounds, that will presumably be produced from the data. The analyses should also be optimized with respect to the total level of systematic uncertainty, which will be the main limiting factor for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) measurements.

Finally, a precise determination of single top quark cross sections can be achieved for a few fb\({}^{-1}\) in the t-channel and the Wt-channel, while for the s-channel, higher statistics will be required. Their possible interpretation in terms of new physics should thus come at a later stage, once the systematic effects are under control.
