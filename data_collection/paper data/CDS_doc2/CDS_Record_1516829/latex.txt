Introduction

In this note we present a couple of options for the layout of the Inner Detector for the phase-II upgrade. In particular we study a layout with 5 pixel barrel layers and we study the impact of shortening the barrel of both the pixel and the SCT detectors.

## 2 Layouts

Figure 1 shows the geometry as used by default for the Letter of Intent in 2012 and 4 alternative geometries that are studied in this note. The geometries all follow the classic barrel-disk structures but differ in the number of pixel barrel layers, and the lengths of the pixel and SCT barrels.

* the _LOI_ layout has 4 pixel barrel layers, 6 pixel disks, 5 SCT barrel layers and 7 SCT disks. In addition it has one short stavelet in the SCT barrel. It is the default geometry for the phase-II LOI. The other layouts all start from this layout.
* the _5-pixel_ layout has a 5th pixel layer added. In addition the SCT stavelet is removed and the remaining SCT layer radii are adjusted to be equidistant. The disk positions are also adjusted to ensure a high number of hits at all \(\eta\).
* the _5-pixel-short_ is similar to the _5-pixel_ layout, but the three outer barrel pixel layers are shortened from 145 to 120 cm.
* the _5-pixel-all-short_ layout is similar to the _5-pixel-short_ layout but now the SCT barrel also is shortened by nearly 20% from 255 cm to 216 cm.
* the _5-pixel-all-short-8-disks_ layout is as the _all-short_ layout but has one additional SCT disk.

Table 1 lists all these layouts, the silicon area they correspond to and the length of the pixel and SCT barrels.

Adding a 5th barrel increases the Pixel area by 25% if the barrels are all kept at the same length. If the outer three barrels are shortened the area is only increased by 14% w.r.t. the LOI layout. The decrease of the SCT barrel length results in a reduction of SCT area by 13%.

## 3 Hit Content and Material Estimate

The hit content is critical for suppressing fake tracks that might otherwise dominate at high \(p_{T}\). Without a full simulation it is difficult to guess the difficulties that the pattern recognition might face. Here we examine a couple of key parameters such as the total number of hits, the number of hits in the pixel and strip detectors and the average and maximum distance between adjacent layers providing hits.

Figure 2 shows the total number of hits comparing the LOI layout to the other layouts. Here the SCT hits are counted as two hits per layer, i.e. hits rather than "space points" are counted. Shown are the hit contents for tracks originating from \(z=0\) and for \(z=+15\) cm. For the latter the coverage is generally worse of course.

At \(z=0\) the LOI layout provides at least 14 hits for \(\eta|<2.5\). For \(z=+15\) cm this is also the case up to \(\eta=2.4\). For the 5-pixel layout the same is true apart from in the range \(0.9<\eta<1.3\) where one hit less is available. This is due to the removal of the SCT stavelet (which provides 2 SCT hits) and the addition of one pixel layer.

For the shorter pixel layers the hit coverage is slightly inferior. Compared to the 5-pixel layout there is one hit less available in the range \(1.2<\eta|<1.4\) since due to the shortened pixel barrel the tracks don't cross the most outer pixel barrel layer. It may be possible to tweak the layout to increase the number of hits at \(\eta=1.3\) from 12 to 13. In the forward region there is also one less pixel hit for \(z=+15\) cm as the

tracks do not cross the inner pixel barrel layer any more in this configuration.

With the shortened SCT barrel the number of hits in the forward region is significantly lower. However, this can be compensated by adding an 8th disc. In that case the number of hits is very comparable to that in the LOI layout.

Fig. 3 shows the number of Pixel and SCT hits for the various layouts for \(z=+15\) cm. For all layouts there are at least 4 pixel hits available up to \(|\eta|=2.7\).

All layouts without the stavelet have a drop by 2 SCT hits (corresponding to the loss of one layer) in the number of hits in the range \(0.9<\eta<1.2\). With the shortened SCT barrel this region gets slightly larger, and in the forward region the hit coverage is also clearly inferior. This is laergely compensated by the addition of an 8th disc.

The distance between the individual layers is another important criterion as the extrapolation over long distances make tracking more difficult. Fig. 4 shows the average distance between hits in adjacent layers. Also shown is the largest distance quantifying the largest extrapolation needed. In both quantities the various layouts are very comparable in most of the \(\eta\) range. However, with the shortened Pixel barrel the average extrapolation is increased at \(\eta\approx 2.5\). Maybe this can be optimized further.

Figure 5 shows the maximum distances between the individual pixel layers and that between pixel and SCT separately.

Figure 6 shows the number of radiation lengths traversed by a particle for the various layouts. In the barrel it is increased from about 20 to 22% due to the addition of the new layer in the Pixel detector. Otherwise no dramatic differences are observed.

## 4 Track parameter measurements

Figure 7 shows the curvature resolution and the \(d_{0}\) resolution versus \(\eta\) for \(p_{T}=1\) GeV. The resolutions are dominated by multiple scattering and thus simply reflect the amount of radiation lengths of each layout.

For \(p_{T}=100\) GeV the resolutions of the curvature \((1/p_{T})\), \(d_{0}\) and \(z_{0}\) are compared for various layouts in Fig. 8. They are very comparable for all layouts. A slight improvement in \(d_{0}\) and \(z_{0}\) resolution is seen with the 5-pixel layout. With the shortened SCT the step in resolution that is usually seen at \(\eta\approx 1.1\) occurs at \(\eta\approx 0.9\) such that in that \(\eta\) range the \(1/p_{T}\) resolution is degraded by 25% and the \(d_{0}\) resolution is degraded by 10%.

Conclusions

We have evaluated the expected performance of a few alternative layouts compared to the LOI layout. In all cases the number of pixel layers has been increased from fou to five and 5 SCT layers of equal length are considered. The length of the pixel and SCT barrel layers is varied to explore the how much the performance would be degraded by such options which would likely be lower in cost. We find that a layout with 5 pixel layers of which 3 layers are shortened by 18% performs well. In this layout the Pixel detector area is 13% larger than in the LOI layout.

We also show that the SCT area can maybe be reduced by about 8% without any loss of performance by reducing the barrel length and adding an additional disk. However, in such a layout significant services would start to disrupt the tracking at lower \(\eta\) values.
