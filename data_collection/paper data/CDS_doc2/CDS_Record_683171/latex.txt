## Abstract

This note documents the work done to study the \(\tau\)-jets separation in ATLAS using a full simulation of the detector.

The criteria used to separate \(\tau\)'s from jets are based on information both from the calorimeters and from the inner detector. The \(\tau\)-identification results strongly \(p_{T}\)-dependent and it also depends on the \(\eta\) position and on the underlying event.

A \(\tau\)-identification with an acceptance around 20% and a very good rejection against the jets from backgrounds (from \(\sim 170\) to \(\sim 1700\)) can be achieved, that is essential for \(A^{0}\to\tau\tau\) analysis; higher acceptances for \(\tau\)'s are obtained with lower jet-rejections.

The results obtained at low luminosity are not sensibly worsened going to high luminosity.

Introduction

Large samples of full simulated events were produced for the preparation of the ATLAS Technical Proposal (TP) [1] and the ATLAS Calorimeter Performance Technical Design Report (TDR) [2], with the aim of studying in a realistic way the performances of the ATLAS detector in the reconstruction of quantities used in the physics event analysis.

In particular a systematic study of \(\tau\)-identification was performed, based on fully simulated events with a pseudoscalar Higgs \(A^{0}\) decaying \(\to\tau\tau\), where one of the \(\tau\)-leptons decays to hadrons and the other one to lepton, and on fully simulated events containing jets. A good sensitivity to \(A^{0}\to\tau\tau\) channel depends crucially on the quality of the \(\tau\)-identification in the ATLAS detector, since backgrounds from jets are potentially very large [1], [2], [3].

This note is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the samples of full simulated events and the detector layouts used; in section 3 it is discussed how a \(\tau\)-jet is chosen in the physics complete events and how precisely the \(\tau\)-jet is measured. The fourth section gives the quantities used to separate \(\tau\)'s from jets. Section 5 describes the criteria used to reach the \(\tau\)-identification versus jet-rejection needed for the study of the \(A^{0}\to\tau\tau\) channel and the sixth one gives the impact of \(\tau\)-identification and jet-rejection and also of \(\tau\) measurement on physics. Section 7 gives the relative dependence between \(\tau\)-identification and jet-rejection as functions of \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) of clusters; the effect of the underlying event is shown in section 8 and the effects of cracks are described in section 9. Section 10 gives criteria for \(\tau\)-veto and finally section 11 shows a comparison between \(\tau\)-identification performances at low and high luminosity.

Event samples and detector layouts

The study of \(\tau\)'s has been performed using the \(A^{0}\to\tau\tau\) full simulated events for \(A^{0}\) masses in the range 100-500 GeV, the background events full simulated for the study of that channel and also the large jet-sample full simulated in 1997 [4]. Also a small sample of isolated \(\tau\)'s has been studied.

In the following sections we call 'TPsample' the sample of events full simulated for the TP, using an old and simplified detector layout, with the electromagnetic calorimeter simulated with a parallel plate geometry and a separated preshower with two views in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter. This simplified layout is not expected to bias significantly the results.

The total 'TPsample' is of \(\sim 13000\) signal full simulated events for 8 different \(A^{0}\) masses and \(\sim 8000\) background events (tt, bb, W+jets), in which \(\sim 10000\)\(\tau\)'s and \(\sim 10000\) jets with \(E_{T}>40\,GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) respectively are present. Details can be found in Table 1 of [3].

A second sample of full simulated events ('97sample') was produced for the preparation of the calorimeter TDR and in 1997 in view of the physics TDR; it is obtained with the 'final' detailed 'Accordeon' geometry for the electromagnetic calorimeters. Details on '97sample' are reported in Tab. 1; it consists of:

* \(\tau\)-jets from two samples of \(A^{0}\to\tau\tau\) signal: associated \(b\!A^{0}\), which is the dominant \(A^{0}\) production process at high \(tg\,(\beta)\) values, and single \(A^{0}\) productions (\(m_{\rm A}\)=100, 150, 300 and 450 GeV). A total of \(\sim\)2700 (+3600) \(\tau\)'s with \(E_{T}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5 have been used.
* jets from typical \(A^{0}\to\tau\tau\) backgrounds like tt, bb, W+jets, in total \(\sim\)3500 jets and \(\sim\)600 b-jets with \(E_{T}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<\)2.5.

We have also used a sample of \(\sim\)26000 jets from the large 1997 jet-sample production, called 'jets97' in the following, consisting in light and heavy quark jets and also gluon jets from many processes (see [4]).

Finally we have also used, for some checks, a sample of 1000 full simulated isolated \(\tau\)'s decaying to hadrons, at fixed \(p_{T\tau}\)=60 GeV and fixed \(\eta_{\tau}\)=0.3, called'single\(\tau\)'.

The results and the figures of this note are generally done using events from '97sample' and from 'jets97'; the results and the figures for 'TPsample' events were given previously in [1], [2] and [3]; however many comparisons between the different event samples are here done.

## 3 \(\tau\)-jet choice and measurement

In all our studies (apart the studies done for cracks) \(\tau\)'s from complete physics events (not isolated \(\tau\)'s!) have been used, so it has to be taken into account that our results are surely worse than the results that can be obtained with single \(\tau\)'s, but they are more realistic to be used for the physics analysis.

In a complete event a jet is labelled as a \(\tau\)-jet if the distance of its barycenter position from the position of the hadronic decay part of the \(\tau\) computed at particle level ( \(\overline{h_{\tau}}\ =\ \overline{\tau}\ -\ \overline{\nu_{\tau}}\)) is \(\Delta R\ =\ \sqrt{(\eta_{\tau-jet}-\eta_{h\tau})^{2}+(\phi_{\tau-jet}-\phi_{h\tau})^{2}} \ <0.3\). Applyingthat criterium, we find that in our physics events, if \(p_{T}(h_{\tau})>\)30 GeV, in 98% of the cases we have at least 1 jet with \(p_{T}>\)30 GeV labelled as \(\tau\)-jet.

The \(\tau\)-jet energy is reconstructed from the calorimeter cell energies, applying the same calibration constants used for jet reconstruction (see [2] and [3]). Fig. 1 gives the distributions of \(p_{T}(\tau\)-jet ) and \(p_{T}(h_{\tau})\) and their ratio. It can be seen that the \(\tau\)-jet energy is overestimated by \(\sim 5\%\) because the electromagnetic content in a \(\tau\)-jet is higher than in a normal jet; the cases in which the \(p_{T}(\tau\)-jet)/\(p_{T}(h_{\tau})\) ratio is very high are due to superposition of other jets to the true \(\tau\)-jet with a consequent too high reconstructed energy. Choosing only \(p_{T}(h_{\tau})>70\) GeV gives a better ratio value with less overflow events. The resolution of the \(\tau\) energy and direction measurement is given in Fig. 2. From the \(\Delta R\) distribution it seems that choosing a \(\Delta R<\,0.1\) cut for \(\tau\)-labelling would not decrease too much the efficiency: that cut could also avoid to accept some of the \(\tau\)'s superposed on other jets.

In any case it will be shown in the section about the impact on physics that the precision of the \(\tau\)-jet energy measurement is not so critical, because the precision of the \(A^{0}\) reconstructed mass is dominated by the \(p_{T}^{miss}\)resolution (see [3] for all details).

## 4 Definition of physical quantities used for \(\tau\)-jet separation

\(\tau\)'s and jets are separated using both information from the calorimeters and from the inner detector.

The quantities used are:

\(\bullet\)\(R_{em}\) that is the jet radius computed using only the electromagnetic cells contained in the jet. It is defined by the following formula:

\(\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}E_{Ti}\sqrt{(\eta_{i}-\eta_{cluster})^{2}+(\phi_{i}-\phi_{ cluster})^{2}}/\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}E_{Ti}\)

where \(i\) is running on all the cells in the electromagnetic calorimeters contained in a cone of R=0.7 around the barycenter of the cluster, whose coordinates are \((\eta_{cluster},\phi_{cluster})\)\(\bullet\)\(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) that is the fraction of transverse energy (computed both from electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter) contained between the cones of size R=0.2 and 0.1 around the barycenter of the cluster;

\(\bullet\)\(N_{tr}\) that is the number of charged tracks with \(p_{T}\) above a fixed cutoff (1, 2 and 5 GeV have been used) pointing to the cluster (within \(\Delta R\)=0.3).

Information from the first layer of the electromagnetic calorimeter, '\(\eta\) strips' layer, have also been studied for events from '97sample':

\(\bullet\) Nstrip that is the number of hit \(\eta\) strips in the '\(\eta\) strips' layer in the electromagnetic calorimeter

\(\bullet\)\(\eta\)-width in '\(\eta\)-strips' layer defined as:

\(\sqrt{\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}E_{Ti}(\eta_{i}-\eta_{cluster})^{2}/\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}E_ {Ti}}\)

where \(i\) is running on all the cells in the first electromagnetic calorimeter layer

\(\bullet\)_distri_ that is the distance between \(\eta\) of the maximum associated \(p_{T}\) track and \(\eta\) of the barycenter of the cluster in the \(\eta\)-strip layer.

The distributions of these quantities for the \(\tau\)'s from \(bbA^{0}\) events in '97sample' and for the jets from 'jets97' are very different if compared before any cut. They are shown in Fig. 3, 4, 5, 6. These quantities are strongly correlated, so, as it will be shown after, it is not necessary to apply analysis cutoffs on all of them.

The \(R_{em}\), \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) and \(N_{tr}\) distributions are in good agreement with the distributions obtained from 'TPsample' and shown in Fig. 4.18 of [2]. Fig. 7 and 8 compare the 'TPsample' (where \(p_{T}>40\) GeV) to '97sample' distributions normalised to the same number of events.

As it will be shown after, there is a strong dependence of the variables we have defined above on the \(p_{T}\) of the cluster, so we have tried to compare 'TPsample' and '97sample' in \(p_{T}\) ranges as much as possible similar; for that reason only jets with \(p_{T}>40\) GeV were here used also for '97sample'; for the \(\tau\)'s in '97sample' \(p_{T}>30\) GeV was used, to have the average values of \(p_{T}\) distributions as much as possible similar. It can be noted that \(R_{em}\) and \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) are narrower for '97sample' events: that can be due to the '\(\eta\)-strips' layer that gives a more accurate estimation of the variables.

On the contrary, Ntr is larger for '97sample' events: that can be due in part to the multiple interactions that were switched off in 'TPsample' simulations and also to the \(\gamma\) conversions in the material in front of the calorimeter (see Fig. 9 where the number of associated tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV is given with and without the tracks from \(\gamma\) conversion). In fact the number of associated charged tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV is sensibly higher than the number of charged particles coming from the hadronic \(\tau\) decay as it can be seen from Fig. 10. Anyway it has been shown that it is possible to identify with a good efficiency the converted photons in the Inner Detector [5], so a correction for this effect is foreseen in future.

## 5 \(\tau\)-jet separation criteria for \(A^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) study

For the study of the \(A^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) channel and to discard as much as possible the background events, very stringent \(\tau\)-identification criteria were chosen.

A hadronic jet with \(E_{T}\)\(>\)30GeV and \(|\eta|\)\(<\) 2.5 was identified as a \(\tau\)-jet if it satisfied the following criteria:

\(\bullet\)\(R_{em}\)\(<\) 0.07,

\(\bullet\)\(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\)\(<\) 0.1,

\(\bullet\)\(N_{tr}=1\) or \(\bullet\)\(N_{tr}=1\) or 3.

The three above cuts are strongly correlated as it can be seen from Fig. 11 and 12. Table 2 shows the efficiencies of these criteria, computed sequentially, for \(\tau\) jets from single and associated bb\(A^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) production events ('97sample'), for jets from the 'jets97' production and from the jets contained in typical backgrounds of \(A^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) channel, which are \(\rm b\overline{b}\), \(\rm t\overline{t}\) and W+jets events.

Table 3 contains the results obtained from 'TPsample', already given in [1], [2], [3] and reported here for comparison (there is a little discrepancy with the results reported in the past because also events with \(m_{\rm A}\)=100 GeV are here used).

In Fig. 11 and 12 the quantities Nstrip, \(\eta\)-width and _distri_ are represented after the three cuts set above. A further cut on these quantities gives no significant gain on the \(\tau\)-efficiency/jet-rejection. This is due to the strong correlation of these quantities with the other ones already used, so, after the cuts, their distributions look very similar for \(\tau\)'s and jets, but it must also be underlined that the cone size used in this analysis (R=0.7) is too large to profit in the best way from the high granularity of the \(\eta\)-strips. In fact the distributions of quantities from \(\eta\)-strips for \(\tau\)'s shown in Fig. 5 have large average values and also long tails due to the fact that many low-energy particles in the event hit the \(\eta\)-strips within the large cone chosen. Average values are smaller and tails are not present if isolated single \(\tau\)'s are studied (see Fig. 24).

An optimisation of the cone size is foreseen in future for the best use of the \(\eta\)-strips for \(\tau\)-identification.

The pure calorimeter cuts (\(R_{em}\) + \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\)) provide a rejection of \(\sim 170\) against jets (from 'jets97') with an efficiency of 40% for hadronic \(\tau\)-decays. Comparing with the results in Tab. 1 of [3], it can be seen that in '97sample' we have the same jet rejection with a higher \(\tau\) efficiency, due to the narrower \(R_{em}\) and \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) distributions, as described at the end of the previous section.

Stronger jet-rejection is achieved using also the number of associated tracks with \(p_{T}>\)2 GeV. The ATLAS inner detector will be able (see section 3.8.5.2 of TP) to reconstruct all tracks starting from a \(p_{T}\)=1 GeV within a low-multiplicity jet environment with very high efficiency and negligible fake track rate, even at the highest luminosities expected at LHC.

The request to have only 1 associated track with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV reduces strongly the \(\tau\) efficiency (a big effect (\(\sim 20\%\)) is due to the \(\gamma\) conversions in the material in front of the calorimeter, as it has been shown in section 4), but it provides an extra rejection factor of \(\sim 3-9\) against jets. The request of having 1 or 3 associated tracks improves of a factor \(\sim\)1.5 the \(\tau\) acceptance, but it does not really improve the sensitivity because also \(\sqrt{B}\), where B indicates the jet background, increases by a factor around 1.5.

Note that here the tracks from KINE bank are used: using the reconstructed tracks in the inner detector (a test has been done on a small \(A^{0}\) event statistics) gives \(\sim~{}10\%\) more of \(\tau\)'s with 1 associated tracks, due to some inefficiency in tracks reconstruction. In Fig. 13 the comparison between reconstructed and KINE tracks is shown, also separately for 1-charged-prong and 3-charged-prong \(\tau\)'s (note that, as it has already said at the end of previous section, the number of associated tracks to 1-charged-prong \(\tau\)'s is in some cases \(>1\), due to the underlying event and to the \(\gamma\)-conversions). From the last plot of Fig. 13 it can be seen that for 1-charged-prong \(\tau\)'s in the 87% of cases the maximum \(p_{T}\) reconstructed track is within \(\pm 5GeV\) the maximum \(p_{T}\) KINE track.

The effect of changing the \(p_{T}\) threshold for tracks has also been studied: results are not sensibly different using 1, 2 or 5 GeV thresholds, as it can be seen from Table 2.

It is important to point out that Table 2 gives results integrated on all clusters with \(p_{T}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) found in signal and background events (\(p_{T}\) distributions are given in Fig. 14 for the different jet types; \(p_{T}\) distribution for \(\tau\)'s was already given in Fig. 1) while for a fixed set of cuts the \(\tau\)-identification efficiency and the corresponding jet-rejection depend on \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) position of clusters (see section 7).

In our \(A^{0}\) analysis, the rejection against jets from t\(\overline{\rm t}\) is better than against jets from W+jets, due to the different jet type (quark or gluon jets) and also to the different \(p_{T}\) distributions. Combining the \(\tau\)-identification efficiencies of t\(\overline{\rm t}\) and W+jets (the relative numbers of events are similar in the samples TP and 97) we obtain a total efficiency of 0.23% which is comparable with the value 0.25% reported in Tab. 3.

The b-jet rejection is stronger than the rejection of other jets, also if it is computed with a large error: 0 b-jets survive over \(\sim\)1600 (considering 622 b-jets in b\(\overline{\rm b}\) events and 1013 b-jets in bbA events), so we quote a b-jet rejection \(<0.06\) (=1./1600).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

After the application of the \(\tau\)-identification criteria with \(N_{tr}\)=1 (see Table 5), for \(m_{\rm A}\)=150 GeV, \(\sim\)88 signal events and \(\sim\)57 background events are expected from the 'a2' analysis while \(\sim\)111 signal events and \(\sim\)1314 background events are expected from the 'a1' one.

The combined significance obtained applying the \(\tau\)-identification criteria is 12.3 which is much higher than the requested significance of 5 which indeed can be obtained with a \(tg(\beta)\) of 6.5.

Asking for \(N_{tr}\)=1 or 3 in the \(\tau\)-identification criteria, the combined significance obtained is comparable or even worse with respect to the one obtained asking for \(N_{tr}\)=1 (see Table 5): this is due to the fact that together with the increase in the expected signal events, there is also an increase in the number of expected background events.

It has been said in section 3 that the precision of the \(\tau\)-jet energy measurement is not so critical in \(A^{0}\) study. In fact the biggest contributions to the width of the reconstructed invariant mass of the \(\tau\)-pair are due to the assumption on the directions of the \(\tau\)-decay products and to the \(p_{T}^{miss}\)resolution (direction and module). Using the reconstructed \(\tau\)-jets instead of the \(\tau\) hadronic part at particle level (\(h_{\tau}\)) the RMS of the reconstructed mass distribution increases only by about 3% and does not change at all its central value (for many details and figures see [3]).

## 7 Jet-rejection vs \(\tau\)-identification

Jet-rejection vs \(\tau\)-identification efficiency has been studied using \(\tau\)'s from associated \(bbA^{0}\) production events from the '97sample' and jets (quark and gluon jets) from the 'jets97', applying to them different cut sets, based on the variables \(R_{em}\), \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) and \(N_{tr}(p_{T}\ >\ 2\ GeV)\), to cover \(\tau\)-identification efficiency values from \(\sim\)10% to \(\sim\)90%.

Due to the dependence on \(p_{T}\) of the \(\tau\)-identification criteria, described previously in section 5, jet-rejection vs \(\tau\)-identification is given for different \(p_{T}\)-ranges.

Fig. 16 and Fig. 17 show how the three variables \(R_{em}\), \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) and \(N_{tr}\) change, changing the cluster \(p_{T}\)-range. The events in each \(p_{T}\)-range were here normalised to 1000 events each: this explains the funny \(p_{T}\) distribution. It is possible to notice that as the \(p_{T}\) gets higher the \(R_{em}\) distribution gets narrower both for \(\tau\)'s and for jets, namely the \(\tau\)-identification efficiency increases while the jet-rejection decreases. This behaviour can be observed in Fig.18 and Fig.19 in which the \(\tau\)-identification efficiency and the jet-rejection are represented widening the \(R_{em}\) cut.

The jet-rejection vs \(\tau\)-identification curves are shown in Fig. 20, for different cut sets that have been obtained widening gradually the \(R_{em}\), \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) and \(N_{tr}\) cuts.

Since a \(\tau\)-identification efficiency value can be obtained from different cut combinations, each time the cut combination corresponding to a maximum rejection against jets has been chosen. These criteria imply that not exactly the same cut combinations have been applied in the different \(p_{T}\) ranges to obtain the curves. A straight line fit has been superimposed on each curve.

As expected, the curves shift to higher \(\tau\)-identification efficiency values as the \(p_{T}\)-range increases. A reasonable approximation of the jet-rejection as function of the \(\tau\)-efficiency and of \(p_{T}\) is given by:

\(rej=10^{(0.027+0.00024*p_{T})*ef_{\tau}+(2.28+0.027*p_{T})}\)

Taking into account that now cuts have been carefully optimised to have the maximum jet-rejection, the agreement with the curves given in [2] is not bad.

To complete this study, also the dependence of \(\tau\)-identification efficiency on \(\eta\) position has been considered. Three \(\eta\) ranges have been considered:

\(0<|\eta|<0.7,\ 0.7\leq|\eta|\leq 1.5,\ 1.5<|\eta|<2.5\).

It is possible to observe that the jet-rejection does not depend on \(\eta\) position as we can see in Fig.21 in which jet-rejection values corresponding to different \(\eta\)-regions are plotted for the same \(\tau\)-identification cuts.

The \(\tau\)-identification efficiency on the contrary is clearly affected by the \(\eta\) position; in Fig.22 it is possible to notice that the average \(\tau\)-identification efficiency values in the full \(\eta\) region (\(0<|\eta|<2.5\)) coincide with the values of the \(0.7\leq|\eta|\leq 1.5\) region, but the \(\tau\)-identification efficiency is higher for central \(\eta\) values and lower for high \(\eta\) values. A parametrization of this behavior is the following:

\((ef_{\tau}(0-07)(in\%)=eff_{\tau}(0.7-1.5)*(1.35-0.0035*eff_{\tau}(0.7-1.5))\)

\((ef_{\tau}(1.5-2.5)(in\%)=eff_{\tau}(0.7-1.5)*(0.70+0.0030*eff_{\tau}(0.7-1.5))\).

This means that the curves of Fig.18 shift towards higher \(\tau\)-identification efficiencies in the \(\eta\)-region (0-0.7) and towards lower \(\tau\)-identification efficiencies in the \(\eta\)-region (1.5-2.5), in particular this shift is more evident for narrower \(\tau\)-identification cuts while the three curves converge as the cuts get wider.

Parametrisations of the jet-rejection vs the \(\tau\)-identification, considering the dependence on \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\), can be useful when the full detector simulation has not been performed. A routine using these parametrisations and giving, for a chosen \(\tau\)-identification efficiency at a chosen \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\), the corresponding jet-rejection has been included in ATLFAST.

## 8 Effects of underlying event

To understand the effect of the underlying event, we have used the sample of full simulated isolated \(\tau\)'s. Fig. 23 shows the comparison of the distributions of the quantities used for the \(\tau\)-identification for isolated \(\tau\)'s and for \(\tau\)'s in bb\(A^{0}\to\tau\tau\) events, choosing for the latter \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) range of \(\tau\)-jets similar to that one of isolated \(\tau\)'s.

The distribution of \(R_{em}\) in particular is larger for \(\tau\)'s in complete events: the difference is high also due to the choice of a quite large cone (R=0.7) for the jet reconstruction. Such choice influences in particular the quantities calculated in \(\eta\)-strips, where many low energy particles can arrive; see Fig. 24 for the comparison of \(\eta\)-strips quantities for isolated \(\tau\)'s and for \(\tau\)'s in events with associated bbA production.

With the criteria used for the \(A^{0}\) analysis reported in section 5, the \(\tau\)-identification efficiency for isolated \(\tau\)'s is about \(36\%\pm 2\%\), that is a much higher value with respect to the efficiencies reported in Tab. 2. More precisely, the \(\tau\)-identification efficiency for \(\tau\)'s in \(A^{0}\) events, chosen in the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) range of the isolated \(\tau\)'s, is \(23\%\pm 2\%\) to be compared with the figure quoted above.

## 9 Effects of cracks

To understand the effect of cracks on \(\tau\)-identification efficiencies on isolated \(\tau\)'s and jets, we report briefly as an example the results of a study done in '95 (full simulation done with july 95 DICE version). In particular the region of the crack between the TILE and the TIXE calorimeter, which corresponded to the region \(0.7\;<\;\eta\;<\;1.2\), was studied.

The sample used consists in a set of isolated \(\tau\)'s and a set of jets generated at a fixed \(p_{T}\)=100 GeV from \(\eta\)=0.3 to \(\eta\)=1.2 (about 500 events for each \(\eta\) point) to cover the region of interest.

In Fig. 25 it is possible to see the \(\tau\)-identification efficiencies vs \(\eta\) for the two sets of events, using the standard \(A^{0}\) analysis cuts of section 5. The \(\tau\)-identification efficiency decreases by 20% for \(\tau\)'s in the crack region while the jets are not particularly affected by the crack, as expected.

## 10 \(\tau\)-veto

The \(\tau\)-veto can be useful for rejection of standard background (for example W \(\rightarrow\tau\nu_{\tau}\)) in the study of SUSY channels. In [2] it was quoted that \(\epsilon_{jet}\sim 84\%\) could be achieved with \(\epsilon_{\tau}\sim 14\%\) requesting \(N_{tr}(>2GeV)>1\) and \(R_{em}>0.12\): the result was integrated on all the \(p_{T}\) of \(\tau\)'s and jets there used.

A more careful study has now been done in three different \(p_{T}\) ranges. Fig. 26 shows a comparison for \(N_{tr}(>1GeV)\), \(R_{em}\) and \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) for \(\tau\)'s and jets in the same \(p_{T}\) range. It can immediately be observed that the difference in the three distributions for \(\tau\)'s and jets decreases from the highest to the lowest \(p_{T}\) range, so the \(\tau\)-veto performance is expected to be different for different \(p_{T}\) ranges.

The results achieved for the \(\tau\)-veto are reported in Fig. 27. It can be seen that \(\epsilon_{jet}\sim 90\%\) can be achieved with \(\epsilon_{\tau}\sim 5\%\) for \(p_{T}>\;60\) GeV, requesting \(N_{tr}(>1GeV)>3\) and \(R_{em}>0.08\). For lower \(p_{T}\) values, a similar \(\epsilon_{\tau}\sim 5\%\) is obtained with a corresponding lower \(\epsilon_{jet}\), decreasing with decreasing \(p_{T}\); \(\epsilon_{jet}\sim 90\%\) is obtained, but with a not negligible \(\epsilon_{\tau}\) increasing with decreasing \(p_{T}\), requesting \(N_{tr}(>1GeV)>1\) and \(R_{em}>0.12\).

A routine with a parametrisation of the \(\tau\)-veto from Fig. 27 has also been included in ATLFAST.

## 11 High luminosity results

It has been verified if the \(\tau\) identification efficiency for \(A^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) study can be maintained at its low-luminosity value with a comparable jet-rejection also at high luminosity.

In [3] that was confirmed using an approximate method to evaluate the contribution of pile-up.

Here pile-up events (obtained summing up full simulated minimum bias events weighted through the electronic shaping functions) are added to physical bbA events in calorimeters: energies from the pileup and from the physical event are added at level of each calorimeter cell. An energy cutoff is applied on the energy in each calorimeter tower: towers are built assuming the wider granularity in a given calorimeter and summing longitudinally the cells in that calorimeter. The cutoff applied corresponds to \(\sim 2.5\sigma\) of the pileup energy in that tower (that cut has been applied to maintain as much as possible the number of reconstructed jets, the jet energy, the total transverse energy in calorimeters and the \(p_{T}^{miss}\)resolution similar to the values obtained when the pileup is not added).

Note that \(R_{em}\) and \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) are built using the cell energy content at low luminosity, while here they are built using the calorimeter tower energy content: this procedure gives a less accurate estimate of the two variables, in particular the \(R_{em}\), but allows to apply a less complicate energy cutoff. Note also that we are here assuming that the number of tracks with \(p_{T}>\)2 GeV is not affected by the pile-up addition.

Fig. 28 gives \(R_{em}\), \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) and \(N_{tr}\) distributions for bbA events with \(m_{A}\)=450 GeV at high luminosity compared with the corresponding distributions at low luminosity. It is also given the distribution of \(\tau\)-jet \(p_{T}\). Fig. 29 is the same as the previous figure for jets in \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\)  events at high and low luminosity. The figures show that the addition of pile-up and the application of calorimeter tower energy cutoff have the effect of enlarging the \(R_{em}\), while the \(\Delta E_{T}^{12}\) distribution is narrower.

Table 6 shows that at high luminosity a \(\tau\)-identification/jet-rejection can be obtained similar to the one obtained at low luminosity, tuning again our analysis cuts.

## 12 Conclusions

The main results of the study are:

* hadronic decaying \(\tau\)'s can be very well reconstructed and identified in ATLAS using information both from calorimeters and inner detector
* \(\tau\)-identification depends on cluster \(p_{T}\), \(\eta\) and on the underlying event
* by tuning the calorimeter and tracking cuts it is possible to change the \(\tau\)-identification acceptance and the corresponding jet-rejection
* with a \(\tau\)-jet identification efficiency of 20% a rejection factor from \(\sim\) 170 to \(\sim\) 1200 against jets from W+jets and \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) and \(\sim\) 1700 against b-jets can be reached, which allows to have a good sensitivity to the \(A^{0}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) channel (\(m_{\mathrm{A}}\)from 100 to 500 GeV)
* by using the same quantities useful for the \(\tau\)-identification it is possible to veto the \(\tau\)-jets (\(\sim\) 5% surviving) with a good acceptance for all other jets (\(\sim\) 90%) if the \(p_{T}\) is above \(\sim\)60 GeV
* the \(\tau\)-identification can be maintained near its low luminosity value with the same jet-rejection also at high luminosity
