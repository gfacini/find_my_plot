The possibility of observing the lightest scalar Higgs boson through the decay \({\rm h\to b\overline{b}}\) is studied within the SUGRA constrained MSSM model. All SUSY processes implemented in PYTHIA are simulated, including \(\widetilde{\rm qq}\), \(\widetilde{\rm qq}\), \(\widetilde{\rm gg}\) production. The \({\rm h\)-boson is mainly produced via the \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)h cascade, with the \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) resulting either from cascade decays of, strongly produced, squarks and gluinos, or from direct chargino/neutralino pair production. The fast simulation package ATLFAST is used for the simulation of the ATLAS detector. The b-tagged jets appearing at the high \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and multi-jet events are used to reconstruct the \({\rm h\to b\overline{b}}\) decay. In several SUSY scenarios, clean signal can be extracted above SUSY and Standard Model background. The \(5\sigma\)-discovery contour curves in the SUGRA parameter space, scanned up to \(m_{0}\)=2000 GeV and \(m_{1/2}\)=1000 GeV, are also shown.

Introduction

One of the most attractive theoretical extensions of the Standard Model (SM) is the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) [1]. The interest in this model lies on the compromise between the simplicity of its particle content, from one side, and on the compatibility with phenomenology, on the other. \(R\)-parity is conserved and, as a consequence, the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is stable and only weakly interacting with matter, giving the characteristic large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) in the supersymmetric (SUSY) events. Although MSSM is highly predictive, the exact phenomenology involved in SUSY cascade processes --necessary for this study-- depends on a large number of parameters, which arise mainly from the soft breaking terms in the supersymmetric potential.

Due to the large number of parameters in the MSSM framework, it is rather difficult to perform a systematic study of the discovery potential of ATLAS in this context. On the other hand, minimal SUGRA model has only five parameters and provides a well defined theoretical framework for the calculation of SUSY particle masses, production cross sections, decay branching ratios, etc. Since it is flexible enough to study a large variety of different SUSY signals, it provides an ideal framework for the study of SUSY signatures in ATLAS, and at the LHC in general.

In order to study the LHC discovery potential, five SUGRA parameter points have been chosen to identify the most interesting, from the experimental point of view, features of the topology of the SUSY events [2, 3, 4]. In particular at Points 1, 2 (\(m_{0}=400\) GeV, \(m_{1/2}=400\) GeV, \(\tan\beta\)=2 and 10, \(\mbox{sgn}\,\mu=+1\), \(A_{0}=0\)) and at Point 5 (\(m_{0}=100\) GeV, \(m_{1/2}=300\) GeV, \(\tan\beta\)=2.1, \(\mbox{sgn}\,\mu=+1\), \(A_{0}=300\) GeV), the lighter Higgs can be easily detected in the cascade decay of SUSY particles, through the decay \(\mbox{h}\to\mbox{b}\overline{\mbox{b}}\). These results give a strong motivation for further studies in the context of minimal SUGRA.

The decay channel \(\mbox{h}\to\mbox{b}\overline{\mbox{b}}\) has been considered so far in the Standard Model and in the MSSM [5, 6, 7], for Higgs boson produced in association with a W or a \(\rm\bar{t}\bar{t}\) pair in Standard Model production processes. In the MSSM case, high squark and gluino masses have been assumed --so that radiative corrections from sparticles are negligible--, and mixing in the stop and sbottom sector is also taken as insignificant. These restrictions led to an almost full coverage of MSSM parameter space for \(m_{\rm A}\gtrsim 100\) GeV [7].

The importance of this discovery channel is dictated by the clearer signature it gives for a large fraction of the SUGRA parameter space, when compared with the SM production of \(\rm Wh\) and \(\rm t\bar{t}h\). Besides that, it provides a starting point to the reconstruction of the SUSY cascade. At Points 1, 2and 5, for instance, a large fraction of the SUSY production involves \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm R}\) associated production, which is followed by the decay chain

\[\begin{array}{ccc}\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}&+\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\\ \downarrow&\downarrow\\ \tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}+\ {\rm q}&\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}+{\rm q}^{\prime}\\ \downarrow&&\\ \tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}+\ {\rm h}&\\ \downarrow&&\\ {\rm b}\bar{\rm b}&\end{array}\]

The distribution of the reconstructed \(m_{\rm bbj}\) allows the measurement of \(m_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}}\)[2, 4, 8], given that \(m_{\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}}\) and \(m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\) are already known from signatures involving leptons. Furthermore, \(m_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm R}}\) can be constrained from the shape of the \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution of the other jet.

This note is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the Monte Carlo programs which were used for the purposes of this study either for the event generation or for the detector simulation. The most important options selected are also mentioned together with some parameters concerning the detector performance. Section 3 is devoted to some general characteristics of SUSY events, as the sparticles' masses, the cross sections, etc., as they vary throughout the SUGRA parameter space. Results obtained in this section are meant to be used as a reference. In Section 4, the Standard Model processes considered as background, as well as the way they were generated, are mentioned. The analysis procedure for extracting the signal is discussed in Section 5.1, where some typical examples are given. The results of the scanning of the parameter space are provided in Section 5.2, showing \(5\sigma\)-discovery contours in the (\(m_{0}\), \(m_{1/2}\)), (\(m_{\rm A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) and (\(m_{\rm h}\), \(\tan\beta\)) planes. The precision with which the h-boson mass can be measured is also discussed in this section. Finally, the conclusions are summarised in Section 6.

## 2 Event and detector simulation

The PYTHIA 6.115 [9] event generator is used for both the SUSY processes and the Standard Model background ones, combined with the package ISASUSY from ISAJET 7.32 [10] for the former. In ISASUSY, the five SUGRA parameters are evolved, by solving the Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs), from the GUT scale down to the electroweak one, in order to obtain the corresponding MSSM parameters. The latter are introduced to PYTHIA, where couplings and sparticles' masses are calculated and event generation takes place. This combination provides the full exploitation of the RGEs implementation in ISAJET (PYTHIA uses only approximate solutions), while at the same time the 2-loop corrections, provided by PYTHIA, are included in the calculation of Higgs bosons masses.

The complete event generation, besides the hard processes, includes Initial and Final State Radiation (ISR, FSR) and hadronization, unless otherwise stated. For the parton distribution, the parametrization CTEQ 3L was used. All the SUSY processes provided by PYTHIA were simulated, i.e., \(\tilde{\chi}\tilde{\chi}\), \(\widetilde{\rm qq}\), \(\widetilde{\rm gg}\), \(\widetilde{\ell}\bar{\ell}\), \(\widetilde{\ell}\widetilde{\nu}\), \(\widetilde{\nu}\widetilde{\nu}\), \(\widetilde{\chi}\widetilde{\rm q}\), \(\widetilde{\chi}\widetilde{\rm g}\), and \(\widetilde{\rm t}\bar{\tilde{\tilde{\chi}}}\) (ISUB=201-280), while the top-quark mass is set to 175 GeV.

The generated events, either SUSY or SM, are afterwards simulated with ATLFAST 1.62 [11]. This includes reconstruction of isolated leptons, missing energy and jets, together with identification of b-jets. The nominal b-tagging efficiency is assumed, namely 60% at low luminosity and 50% at high luminosity. The effect of pile-up events at high luminosity, as implemented in ATLFAST-B, have been taken into account

* by degrading the b-tagging efficiency to 50% (from the assumed 60% for low luminosity), and
* by applying an extra smearing to the jets momentum \[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{7.5\,{\rm GeV}}{p_{\rm T}}\] corresponding to the default cone algorithm (\(\Delta R=0.4\)), which is used during this study.

The minimum values of \(E_{\rm T}\) required for clusters and jets reconstruction were set to 5 GeV and 10 GeV, respectively. These very low thresholds were set in order to allow the use of the same generated sample in analyses for low and high luminosity performance. A more detailed study of the b-tagging performance can be found in Ref. [12].

The presented results correspond to integrated luminosity of \(30\,{\rm fb}^{-1}\) (low luminosity performance) and of \(300\,{\rm fb}^{-1}\) (high luminosity performance).

## 3 SUSY processes

### Sparticles and Higgs masses

In order to have an insight of the processes which lead the production of the Higgs boson, the knowledge of the spectrum of sparticles' masses is necessary.

The masses of the gluino, the average of the squarks' masses of the first two generations, as well as the ratio \(m_{\tilde{g}}/m_{\tilde{q}}\) are shown in Fig. 1. The ratio \(m_{\tilde{g}}/m_{\tilde{q}}\) determines whether the channel \(\tilde{\rm g}\to\tilde{\rm q}\rm q\) is open or not, which is important for the Higgs boson present in the SUSY cascade, as will be described in Section 3.2. Gluino's mass is almost independent of \(m_{0}\), while it increases linearly with \(m_{1/2}\). Squarks' masses, on the other hand, depend on both \(m_{0}\) and \(m_{1/2}\). Squarks' and gluino's masses do not depend on \(\tan\beta\) or \({\rm sgn}\,\mu\) and this is reflected on their production cross sections and decays (see next section).

The theoretically excluded regions correspond to models in which the \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) is the LSP --instead of the lightest neutralino-- (low \(m_{0}\) and high \(m_{1/2}\)), or electroweak symmetry breaking does not occur properly (high \(m_{0}\) and low \(m_{1/2}\)). Regions already excluded by limits on the sparticle masses given by LEP2 and Tevatron [13] are also shown. The actually used indicative bounds are shown in Table 1. The more restrictive limit is the lower bound of the chargino mass, which covers the region with \(m_{1/2}\lesssim 120\,{\rm GeV}\).

The curves of constant mass for the lightest neutralino and chargino are given in Fig. 2. The \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) are almost degenerated in mass and \(m_{\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}}\simeq m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}}\simeq 2\,m_{\tilde{ \chi}_{1}^{0}}\simeq 0.8\,m_{1/2}\). Their masses only depend on \(m_{1/2}\).

Supergravity predicts rather heavy Higgs, when compared with the ones of the more general model of MSSM [14]. The A\({}^{0}\), H\({}^{0}\) and H\({}^{\pm}\) are degenerated in mass to less than 2%, and their masses are above 300 GeV in the allowed part of the parameter space. The lightest Higgs boson, h, is lighter for positive \(\mu\) than for negative \(\mu\), but this difference ceases to exist at higher \(\tan\beta\). The iso-mass contours in the \((m_{0},\,m_{1/2})\) plane for h- and A\({}^{0}\)-boson are shown in Fig. 3 for different values of \(\tan\beta\) and \({\rm sgn}\,\mu\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c||} \hline Particle & Lower mass limit (GeV) \\ \hline \(\rm h\) & 64.5 \\ \(\rm\widetilde{q}\) & 267 \\ \(\rm\widetilde{g}\) & 165 \\ \(\rm\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) & 14 \\ \(\rm\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) & 91 \\ \(\rm\tilde{\ell}\) & 80 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The shaded areas are excluded either theoretically or experimentally.

### Cross sections and branching ratios

As mentioned in the previous section, SUSY production is primarily determined by the relations between the sparticles' masses, and not by the values of \(\tan\beta\) and \(\rm{sgn}\,\mu\). The total cross section has a sharp maximum at (\(m_{0}\), \(m_{1/2})\simeq\) (50 GeV, 100 GeV), where it reaches \(10^{3}\) pb, but it drops rapidly when \(m_{0}\) and \(m_{1/2}\) increase --since sparticles' masses increase--, reaching 0.1 pb for \(m_{1/2}\simeq 700\) GeV (Fig. 4). The contributions of the various SUSY processes to this cross section are depicted in Figures 5-9. The \(\widetilde{\rm qq}\) production involves qq, \(\rm{q\overline{q}}\) and gg fusion resulting in \(\widetilde{\rm q}_{L}\widetilde{\rm q}_{L}\), \(\widetilde{\rm q}_{L}\widetilde{\rm q}_{R}\) or \(\widetilde{\rm q}_{R}\widetilde{\rm q}_{R}\) pairs.

As shown in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6, in the high-\(m_{0}\) and high-\(m_{1/2}\) region of the SUGRA parameter space, the direct production of charginos and neutralinos is not negligible. Effectively, in the upper-right quarter on the (\(m_{0},\,m_{1/2}\)) plane, \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) production contribute to the total cross section at a level of 40% each. Since \(BR(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}{\rm W})\simeq 1\) for the largest part of this plane and \(BR(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}h)>90\%\) (Fig. 11), about 20% of the SUSY events give a clear h \(\rightarrow\) b\(\rm{\overline{b}}\) signal, while the other SUSY events are ruled out bythe selection requirement of having two b-jets. Nevertheless, as it will be shown in the next section, this does not necessarily imply that \(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) can be observed above the background in this region.

The dominant source of signal events are SUSY production processes involving squark and/or gluino production. These are the most significant in the five SUGRA points selected for the study of exclusive channels [2, 3, 4] and in a large part of the scanned SUGRA plane. As one can conclude from Fig. 1 and Figures 7-9, the relative cross sections for \(\widetilde{\mathrm{q}}\mathrm{q}\), \(\widetilde{\mathrm{q}}\mathrm{g}\) and \(\widetilde{\mathrm{g}}\widetilde{\mathrm{g}}\) production, respectively, merely follow the relation between squark and gluino masses. For low \(m_{0}\) and large \(m_{1/2}\), the \(\widetilde{\mathrm{q}}\mathrm{q}\) production is dominant (\(>40\%\)) since \(m_{\widetilde{\mathrm{g}}}>m_{\widetilde{\mathrm{q}}}\), while at large \(m_{0}\) and low \(m_{1/2}\) where \(m_{\widetilde{\mathrm{g}}}<m_{\widetilde{\mathrm{q}}}\), the \(\widetilde{\mathrm{g}}\widetilde{\mathrm{g}}\) production is significant (\(>30\%\)). At the lower-left quarter of the (\(m_{0},\,m_{1/2}\)) plane, where both the \(\widetilde{\mathrm{q}}\) and \(\widetilde{\mathrm{g}}\) masses are low, \(\widetilde{\mathrm{q}}\widetilde{\mathrm{g}}\) contributes more than 35% to the total SUSY production.

Sleptons' and sneutrinos' direct production is not significant except for \(m_{0}<600\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(m_{1/2}>400\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (where they are lighter than squarks, gluinos and charginos), representing a fraction of 2-10% of the total SUSY cross section. Staus and the corresponding sneutrinos are included in this

proportion. Nevertheless, since in the most part of this region, either \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) is the LSP, or these scalars decay to the lightest neutralino and the corresponding fermions, their presence is not a source of signal events.

Mixed processes, like \(\widetilde{\rm g}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\), \(\widetilde{\rm g}\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\), \(\widetilde{\rm q}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\widetilde{\rm q}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\), give smaller contributions of the order or less than 1%. The same holds for the cross section of \(\tilde{\rm t}_{1}\tilde{\rm t}_{1}\) and \(\tilde{\rm b}_{1}\tilde{\rm b}_{1}\) production, which acquire their maximum values for \(m_{\widetilde{\rm g}}>m_{\widetilde{\rm q}}\), but they remain below 0.5%.

The branching ratio of \({\rm h}\to{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) for different values of \(\tan\beta\) and \({\rm sgn}\,\mu\) is shown in Fig. 10. Its value is almost the same for the two signs of \(\mu\), but it decreases with \(\tan\beta\). It depends weakly on \(m_{0}\) and \(m_{1/2}\), and it ranges from 86% to 90%. So since the decay of the h-boson into two b-jets is rather straightforward, the issue is the determination of the parameter points in which:

* h-boson production is high; and
* the irreducible background with two b-jets from other SUSY processes is low.

The complexity of the SUSY signatures according to the processes being involved implies that individual analysis for some SUGRA points is necessary.

Figure 8: Relative contribution of \(\tilde{\rm q}\tilde{\rm g}\) production to the total SUSY cross section for \(\tan\beta\)=10, \({\rm sgn}\,\mu=+1\), and \(A_{0}=0\).

Figure 9: Relative contribution of \(\tilde{\rm g}\tilde{\rm g}\) production to the total SUSY cross section for \(\tan\beta\)=10, \({\rm sgn}\,\mu=+1\), and \(A_{0}=0\).

As already mentioned, h-boson is expected to be produced from the decay \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)h (Fig. 11). This decay has a substantial branching ratio in a large fraction of the parameter space. The lower-\(m_{1/2}\) bound (200-250 GeV for \(\tan\beta\)=2 and \(\sim\) 350 GeV for higher \(\tan\beta\)) separates the kinematically allowed/forbidden region for this decay. Below that bound, three-body decays of \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\) occur, like \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)q\(\bar{\rm q}\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)Z\({}^{0}\).

In Figures 12-17, the branching ratios of the squarks' and gluino's most relevant to this analysis decays are shown. The squarks of the first two generations decay mainly to gluinos (\(\sim\)70%-90%), or --if this decay is kinematically forbidden-- to gauginos plus quarks. In that case, the branching ratios are more or less as follows:

\[\begin{array}{ccc}\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}{\rm q}\ \stackrel{{ 50\%}}{{ \longleftarrow}}&\widetilde{\rm q}\ \ \stackrel{{ 15\%}}{{ \longleftarrow}}\ \tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}{\rm q}\\ &&\Big{\downarrow}_{30\%}\\ &&\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}{\rm q}^{\prime}\end{array}\]

Gluinos, on the other hand, are primarily produced in the low-\(m_{1/2}\) region --\(\widetilde{\rm gg}\) production represents more than 40% of the SUSY processes for \(m_{1/2}<300\) GeV (Fig. 9). They decay into various products, such as \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{i}{\rm q}\overline{\rm q}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{j}{\rm q}\overline{\rm q}^{\prime}\). Among these states, the \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{i}{\rm b}\)\(\bar{\rm b}\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{j}{\rm t}\)\(\bar{\rm b}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{j}{\rm W}{\rm b}\)\(\bar{\rm b}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{i}{\rm t}\overline{\rm t}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{i}{\rm W}{ \rm W}{\rm b}\)\(\bar{\rm b}\) represent a significant irreducible background. Especially for \(\tan\beta\)=2, where \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)h is open for low-\(m_{0}\) values, this background is significant, but the large production rate of SUSY events assures that h \(\rightarrow\) b\(\bar{\rm b}\) remains observable. This is no longer true for values of \(\tan\beta\) where \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\)h is closed. In that cases, h production relies on cascades such as:

\[\begin{array}{c}\widetilde{\rm g}\longrightarrow{\rm heavy}\ \tilde{\chi} \longrightarrow{\rm light}\ \tilde{\chi}+{\rm h}\\ \widetilde{\rm g}\longrightarrow{\rm b}_{1}\ {\rm or}\ \tilde{\rm t}_{1} \longrightarrow{\rm heavy}\ \tilde{\chi}\longrightarrow{\rm light}\ \tilde{\chi}+{\rm h}\end{array}\]

with a low h \(\rightarrow\) b\(\bar{\rm b}\) production rate (about 6% of the SUSY production for \(m_{0}\)=800 GeV, \(m_{1/2}\)=250 GeV, \(\tan\beta\)=2, \({\rm sgn}\,\mu=+1,A_{0}=0\)). Additional background is present from the decay of heavy gauginos (such as \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\)) into lighter gauginos plus Z\({}^{0}\) bozons, which eventually give a b\(\bar{\rm b}\) pair with a probability 15%.

At SUGRA parameter configurations with large squark production, the gluinos are decaying into squarks (Fig. 16), while in the region where electroweak production dominates, gluinos result in stops (Fig. 17). In these cases, however, gluinos are not frequently produced in the cascade.

The dominant SUSY production processes in the SUGRA parameter space (\(\widetilde{\rm qq}\), \(\widetilde{\rm q}\overline{\rm g}\), \(\widetilde{\rm gg}\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\)\(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\), \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\)\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}\)) and their corresponding contributions to the total cross section are summarized in Fig. 18.

Standard Model background

As described in Ref. [2], the main sources of the Standard Model background for the signal channel under study are \(\rm t\bar{t}\), Z+jet with \(\rm Z\to\tau\tau,\,\nu\nu\), and W+jet with \(\rm W\to\ell\nu\), \(\tau\nu\) events. These processes are characterized by relatively large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) (when compared with other SM processes), induced by the undetected neutrinos, while high lepton and jet multiplicity is also present. The \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cut (\(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>200\,\rm GeV\) or higher) suppresses significantly the SM background, and a lepton veto reduces it further excluding to large extend events which survive the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cut. In some regions of SUGRA parameter space, requiring two hard and central jets is very efficient for reducing W+jet and Z+jet background, while still having high efficiency for the signal [2].

Standard Model events were generated in different \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm hard}\) bins, which defined minimum and maximum \(p_{\rm T}\) of the hard scattering process. Only events with at least four reconstructed jets, after processing with ATLFAST, were stored for future analysis, since this requirement --two b-jets plus two additional jets-- is a basic selection criterion for extracting the signal (see Section 5.1). The cross sections of the SM processes are listed in Table 2.

At a first stage, the following'main selection cuts' were imposed to these events:

* \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>200\,\rm GeV\);
* lepton veto on \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm e}>5\) GeV, \(p_{\rm T}^{\mu}>6\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\);
* at least two tagged b-jets with \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm b-jet}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\);
* at least two additional jets with \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<5\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & & Number of expected & \\ Process & \(\sigma\times BR\) (pb) & events after main cuts & Acceptance \\  & & in the mass window & \\ \hline \(\rm t\bar{t}\) & 574 & 19 800 & \(1.15\cdot 10^{-3}\) \\ Z+jet, Z\(\to\nu\nu\) & 4 740 & 73.7 & \(5.18\cdot 10^{-7}\) \\ Z+jet, Z\(\to\tau\tau\) & 1 390 & 2 490 & \(5.97\cdot 10^{-5}\) \\ W+jet, W\(\to\tau\nu\) & 7 710 & 1 150 & \(4.96\cdot 10^{-6}\) \\ W+jet, W\(\to\) e\(\nu,\ \mu\nu\) & 15 500 & 526 & \(1.13\cdot 10^{-6}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Production cross sections, number of events satisfying the main selection criteria and acceptances for the SM background processes and for an integrated luminosity of \(30\,\rm fb^{-1}\).

The effect of these cuts on the SM background is shown in Table 2, where events in the mass window \(|m_{\rm bb}-m_{\rm h}|<25\) GeV are counted assuming \(m_{\rm h}=100\) GeV, so that it is of the same order as the Higgs mass predicted by SUGRA. After these cuts, only the irreducible \(\rm t\bar{t}\) background remains significant, since it always gives a \(\rm b\bar{b}\) pair.

## 5 Observability of the \(\bf h\to b\bar{b}\) channel

### Analysis

As already mentioned, the analysis was performed following the selection algorithm proposed in Ref. [2], where a cut requiring hard non-b-jets was used to suppress the SM background. This would work for large masses of squarks and gluinos. The requirement of at least two b-jets, large missing transverse energy, and the lepton veto represent the baseline of the selection process. The standard cuts used for all parameter points are:

* \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>200\) GeV;
* lepton veto for \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm e}>5\) GeV, \(p_{\rm T}^{\mu}>6\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\);
* at least two non-b-jets with \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta|<5\);
* at least two b-jets (after applied b-tagging efficiency) with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm b-jet}>15\) GeV (low luminosity) or \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm b-jet}>30\) GeV (high luminosity);
* separation angle between the two b-jets \(\Delta R_{\rm bb}>2\); and
* \(m_{\rm bb}\) in a mass window \(m_{\rm h}\pm 25\) GeV.

The selection cuts aimed both at reducing the background from SM processes (basically the \(\rm t\bar{t}\) production), and at excluding SUSY events were no h-boson is produced. The \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) threshold was increased with \(m_{1/2}\) from 300 GeV for \(m_{1/2}=300\) GeV to 600 GeV for \(m_{1/2}=1000\) GeV. This cut, in combination with a cut on the hardest b-jet in the event, suppresses substantially the SM background. The latter cut is essential in cases where the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) of the SUSY events is not much higher than the one of the SM events. The variation of the thresholds on \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and \(p_{\rm T}\) of the hardest b-jet, the mean value of the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) (for \(E_{T}^{miss}>200\) GeV) and the acceptance accomplished with the final selection cuts for several SUGRA points are listed in Table 3.

The \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) acquires its maximum value in the low-\(m_{0}\) and high-\(m_{1/2}\) region, where SUSY production is dominated by squark pairs. This is explained by the fact that LSPs are abundantly produced (as shown in Fig. 15,\(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\)q) \(\simeq\) 50%) directly from the decay of the rather heavy squarks (\(m_{\widetilde{\rm q}}\simeq 1500-2000\) GeV) to the much lighter neutralinos (\(m_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\simeq 300-400\) GeV). On the contrary, at the high-\(m_{0}\) and high-\(m_{1/2}\) part of the parameter space, where about 80% of the events initiates from a \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) or \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) pair, the LSP results from a \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) or a \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) which have a mass of only 500-800 GeV.

As examples of the event topology and the applied selection cuts, three SUGRA points --denoted as I, II and III-- are discussed below.

**I. Higgs production dominated by \(\bf{\tilde{q}}/\bf{\tilde{g}}\) cascade: \(m_{0}\)=800 GeV, \(m_{1/2}\)=500 GeV, \(\tan\beta\)=10, \(\rm{sgn}\,\mu\)=+1, \(A_{0}\)=0.**

At this point, all of the main production processes mentioned in the previous section are involved, with the \(\widetilde{\rm q}\widetilde{\rm g}\) production being the dominant one (\(\sim\) 35%). The SUSY cross section, sparticles' masses, selection cuts and signal

At the point (\(m_{0}\), \(m_{1/2}\))=(300 GeV, 1000 GeV), there is no Higgs production, so no analysis was performed.

significance are listed in Table 4.

For an integrated luminosity of \(30\mbox{ fb}^{-1}\), about 500 signal events are expected to be clearly seen above a background of \(\sim 230\) events, with a significance of \(33\sigma\). The hadronic activity is very high (on average \(\sim 7.6\) non-b-jets for SUSY events selected with the main cuts) due to the jets produced during the cascade decays of the squarks or gluinos. The average missing transverse energy is well above 300 GeV, allowing the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cut to reject a large fraction of the SM background.

The reconstructed \(m_{\rm bb}\) for all the SUSY processes, the SUSY processes where no h-boson is produced, and the Standard Model background is shown in the upper plot of Fig. 19 for this specific point.

**II. Higgs production dominated by electroweak processes (\(\tilde{\chi}_{\bf 1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{\bf 1}^{\pm}\), \(\tilde{\chi}_{\bf 2}^{0}\tilde{\chi}_{\bf 1}^{\pm}\)): \(m_{0}\)=1400 GeV, \(m_{1/2}\)=750 GeV, \(\tan\beta\)=2, \({\rm sgn}\,\mu\)=-1, \(A_{0}\)=0.**

In this case, each of the \(\tilde{\chi}_{\bf 1}^{\pm}\tilde{\chi}_{\bf 1}^{\pm}\) and \(\tilde{\chi}_{\bf 2}^{0}\tilde{\chi}_{\bf 1}^{\pm}\) processes contribute about 30% to the total SUSY production. Thus, the SUSY cascade is shorter and dominated by two decay chains. Since a lepton veto has been applied --hence events with \(\mbox{W}\rightarrow\mbox{qq}^{\prime}\) are mostly selected--, the most characteristic signatures of SUSY events are:

The distributions are shown for the signal+other SUSY processes (light shaded), for the other SUSY processes (dark shaded) and the SM background (black shade).

The number of jets per event is lower than that for Point I (on average \(\sim\) 6.3 jets) but the related cut had to be harder for Point II (as shown in Table 4), in order to overwhelm the large background from the SM processes. Despite that, the channel h \(\rightarrow\) b\(\overline{\text{b}}\) cannot be observed at that point, being only 2.5\(\sigma\) significant over the background for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(\text{fb}^{-1}\). The corresponding \(m_{\text{bb}}\) distribution is shown at the central plot of Fig. 19.

Generally at the upper-right part of the parameter space, the h \(\rightarrow\) b\(\overline{\text{b}}\) signal can be easily distinguished from the other SUSY processes, since its topology is rather well defined. The cross section of the SUSY events, however, is low when compared with the SM background, and does not permit the observation of the channel. Besides that, the cascade initiates from the light gauginos and not from the much heavier squarks and gluinos, resulting in lower \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) than in the SUGRA parameter space of low \(m_{1/2}\) (see Table 3).

**III. Higgs production dominated by \(\mathbf{\tilde{q}\tilde{q}}\) strong production: \(m_{0}\)=400 GeV, \(m_{1/2}\)=750 GeV, \(\tan\beta\)=30, \(\text{sgn}\,\mu\)=-1, \(A_{0}\)=0.**

At this point, the light Higgs is produced either from the decay \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\)h (\(BR=62\%\)), or from the heavy stau with a probability \(BR(\tilde{\tau}_{2}\rightarrow\tilde{\tau}_{1}\text{h})=40\%\). Staus are produced in the decay of heavy gauginos to light ones and their coupling to the Higgs is enhanced by the large value of \(\tan\beta\). This production becomes more important as \(m_{1/2}\) increases. However, in such cases SUSY production has lower cross section and h \(\rightarrow\) b\(\overline{\text{b}}\) remains unobservable.

The reconstructed \(m_{\text{bb}}\) for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(\text{fb}^{-1}\) is shown in Fig. 19 (bottom) and the selection cuts applied are listed in Table 4. The high \(p_{\text{T}}\) of the LSP allows an \(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) cut as high as 600 GeV, which suppresses significantly the SM background.

### Scanning of the SUGRA parameter space

The visibility of the h \(\rightarrow\) b\(\overline{\text{b}}\) channel in SUSY cascade was studied for \(\tan\beta\)=2, 10 and 30, \(A_{0}=0\) and both signs of \(\mu\). For these values, the (\(m_{0}\), \(m_{1/2}\)) plane was scanned for \(m_{0}\) varying from \(\sim\) 100-2000 GeV and for \(m_{1/2}\) from \(\sim\) 100-1000 GeV. In each point of the grid, the production rate of the \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\) events was estimated by generating 1000 hard process events and calculating the fraction which contains at least one Higgs. This number was used to estimate the total expected number of events taking into account: the total cross section, the branching ratio of \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\), and the integrated luminosity. For several points, individual analysis was performed and the obtained acceptances were interpolated to the grid.

In most cases, the significance was estimated with gaussian statistics as \(S/\sqrt{B}\). When both numbers of signal and background events were less than 25, Poisson statistics was employed for the calculation of the significance1.

The \(5\sigma\) observability contours in the SUGRA parameter space are shown in Figures 20-25 for an integrated luminosity of \(\rm 30\;fb^{-1}\) (top plots) and \(\rm 300\;fb^{-1}\) (bottom plots). The \(BR(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\to\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\rm h)=50\%\) contour, which is also drawn, displays the correlation between the opening of this channel and the observation of \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\).

### Precision of the Higgs boson mass measurement

The mass of the lightest Higgs can be determined from the position of the \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\) peak in the \(m_{\rm bb}\) distribution. The precision of this measurement was calculated using the method described in Ref. [15]. A systematic error due to the uncertainty on the absolute energy scale of 1% is assumed for the b-jets. For the statistical error, the background is assumed to be flat under the gaussian2 peak. The width of the mass window (\(\pm 25\) GeV) is kept constant in the parameter space, corresponding to 1-1.7 times the mass resolution. The precisions obtained for three selected points (called A, B and C) are listed in Table 5.

Footnote 2: Actually, the gaussian and the flat distribution are restricted to the mass window when used as probability distribution functions.

First of all, the precision is limited by the systematic error to be of 1% due to the jet energy scale uncertainty. This is demonstrated at Point A, where the number of signal events is as high as 3380, thus making the statistical error very small. For the points with low signal, as Points B and C, the combined statistical and systematic uncertainty does not exceed 2%. So, a precision of 1-2% in the measurement of the lightest Higgs' mass is attainable.

## 6 Conclusions

In this note, the expected potential of the ATLAS detector for observing the decay channel \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\), where the Higgs boson is produced in the cascade decay of SUSY particles was determined. Even for three years of LHC running with low luminosity (integrated luminosity of \(30\:\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)), a large part of the SUGRA parameter space will be covered.

The projection of the \(5\sigma\)-discovery regions in the SUGRA parameter space for both \(\mathrm{sgn}\,\mu\) onto the \((m_{\mathrm{A}},\,\tan\beta)\) and \((m_{\mathrm{h}},\,\tan\beta)\) planes are shown in Figures 26 and 27, respectively, for integrated luminosities of \(30\:\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and \(300\:\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). In the \((m_{\mathrm{h}},\,\tan\beta)\) plane, there is no evident enhancement of the discovery potential when integrated luminosity rises. This is due to the weak dependence of \(m_{\mathrm{h}}\) on the \((m_{0},\,m_{1/2})\) value. In a large fraction of the \((m_{\mathrm{A}},\,\tan\beta)\) parameter space above \(m_{\mathrm{A}}=500\) GeV (resp. \(m_{\mathrm{A}}=400\) GeV) for \(\tan\beta>5\) (resp. \(\tan\beta>30\)), the \(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) will be observable even for an integrated luminosity of \(30\:\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). In this region however, there is no sensitivity to the heavy Higgs bosons in the MSSM model [6]. Only the light Higgs is expected to be observable in this region for the Standard Model production processes with the \(\mathrm{h}\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) mode. Hence, the capability for the discrimination between SM and MSSM Higgs boson is very limited for signal observed in the SM associated or direct production.
