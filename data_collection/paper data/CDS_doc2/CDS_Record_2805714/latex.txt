# Summary Plots for Heavy Particle Searches and Long-lived Particle Searches - March 2022

The ATLAS Collaboration

The results of searches for heavy particles from the Exotics and HDBS physics groups and long-lived particles from the Exotics and SUSY physics groups are summarized in plots for a representative set of models. The latest results, up to March 2022, are included.

## 1 Heavy Particle Searches Summary Plot

Searches for heavy new particles have been carried out with the Run 1 and Run 2 datasets in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) and 13 TeV.

A representative set of the most sensitive recent results is included in the summary plot shown in Figure 1. Some changes are made to include updated references and to supersede older results with new ones. New entries relative to the July 2021 version of the summary plot [1] are as follows.

* Search for pair production of third-generation vector leptoquarks in events with \(\tau\)-leptons and \(b\)-tagged jets [2].
* Search for pair production of doubly-charged Higgs bosons decaying into same-sign leptons \(H^{\pm}\to\ell^{\pm}\ell^{\pm}\)[3].
* Search for \(WZ\) resonances in fully-leptonic final state [4], especially in the vector-boson fusion mechanism.

## 2 Long-lived Particle Searches Summary Plot

Searches for long-lived particles have been carried out with the Run 1 and Run 2 datasets in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) of 8 and 13 TeV.

Recent updates of the results are included in the summary plot shown in Figure 2. Some changes are made to include updated references and to supersede older results with new ones. New entries relative to the July 2021 version of the summary plot [1] are as follows.

* Search for heavy long-lived charged particles with large ionisation energy loss [5].
* Search for long-lived particles decaying into hadronic jets in the calorimeter [6].
* Search for long-lived particles decaying into hadronic jets in the muon spectrometer [7].
* Search for long-lived particles decaying into displaced lepton-jets [8].
* Search for long-lived heavy neutral leptons using a dilepton displaced vertex [9].
