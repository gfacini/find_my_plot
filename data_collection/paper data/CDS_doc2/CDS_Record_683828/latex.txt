###### Abstract

We measured thermal runaway properties of previously irradiated silicon detectors cooled by TPG bars. We simulated their expected behaviour to measure the energy gap in the detector material and to test the validity of various underlying assumptions.

Introduction

Silicon detectors that have been exposed to radiation suffer from large leakage currents. Together with the high depletion voltage needed for their efficient operation, that may well lead to considerable heating of such devices. This will in turn increase leakage currents further, eventually leading to "thermal runaway" and, hence, to unreliable, unstable operation. As a result, much ingenuity has been applied to the installation of effective cooling procedures for detector modules [1].

In this spirit, we simulated the thermal properties of our design, as used in the ATLAS forward central tracker, and subjected several previously irradiated modules to a series of measurements. This permits us to test the validity of the underlying assumptions, and to determine the best parameters for a successful description of the devices. Our assumptions included:

* homogeneous heat production in the detectors, neglecting the effect of the particular structure of the device at hand;
* a temperature dependence of the leakage current according to \[I(T)=I_{0}T^{2}\exp\left(-\frac{E_{g}}{2kT}\right)\] (1) For silicon, the band gap is \(E_{g}=1.1\) eV.

Past experiments on this issue [2] have used dummy silicon detectors, ignoring all detector structure, using heater foils for the simulation of thermal conduction. While useful for an overall assessment of the effectiveness of cooling elements, they were not in a position to provide a realistic picture of local heat production in actual detectors. To remedy such shortcomings, we used detector modules that had been exposed to well- monitored radiation doses; and we cooled them by TPG bars to approximate conditions that will prevail in the final detector. While not realistic for the ATLAS barrel vertex detector in a number of details, where similar studies have been performed [3], our study will help to measure the gap parameter of the irradiated modules as well as the value of finite-element simulations for the description of crucial features of the thermal behavior of our detector.

## 2 Experimental Setup

For the present study, we used ATLAS barrel detector silicon p-on-n units measuring \(64\times 64~{}mm^{2}\)**,** of \(0.5\)mm thickness, made by Eurisys. They had been exposed to a radiation dose of \(3\times 10^{14}\) p/cm\({}^{2}\). For cooling purposes TPG bars, \(120\) mm lang and \(12.6\) mm wide, had been glued to their unpassivated back sides, using NEE-001 silicon-based glue. The TPG bars were long enough (cf. 1) to reach cooling elements used as heat sinks. The uncoated TPG bars were produced by Advanced Ceramics Corp.; their nominal in-plane heat conductivity is \(1700\) W/mK. Their ends were joined to Peltier-type cooling elements fed, in turn, by chillers. We were able to monitor the temperatures along our setup with 6 thermocouples, 3 each on the detectors and on the TPG bars (as shown in Fig. 2).

We operated this setup inside a vacuum vessel which permitted us to minimize the effects of atmospheric heat conduction; as we will mention below, we were not able to do a good job shielding our devices from thermal radiation inside this vessel, which was operated at about 25\({}^{o}\)C, despite some efforts to this effect. The Peltier-driven cooling elements were operable between -30\({}^{o}\)C and +25\({}^{o}\)C.

The setup is schematically shown in Fig. 1; the distribution of thermocouples on the detector array can be gleaned from Fig. 2.

## 3 Measurements

For a proper understanding of the detector properties, we first determined their voltage/current characteristic, up to bias voltages of 400 V, for various cooling temperatures. The results are shown, for the two detectors, in Fig.s 3a,b. Only at low temperatures \(<\)-7\({}^{o}\)C, the behavior is as expected from eq.(1); we can interpret this as telling us that the detector has not been damaged during module assembly. At higher temperatures, thermal effects by heating through leakage currents make the IV curves deviate from the expected one. This deviation, of course, is the subject of the present study. Note that the second detector deviates ever-so-slightly from the behavior just described (Fig, 3b).

For the subsequent measurements of temperature profiles and current "runaway", we now set the bias voltage to 400 V. We then stepped up the temperatures \(T_{c}\) of the chilling

point from -30\({}^{o}\)C to +5\({}^{o}\)C. It is approximately in this temperature range (up to 3.8\({}^{o}\)C for detector 1, 5.3\({}^{o}\)C for detector 2) that stable response is evident. Upon further increase of \(T_{c}\), leakage currents start to rise dramatically, finally reaching the 8 mA current limit of the power supply used in the experiment. This is a clear indication of "thermal runaway".

## 4 Simulation

We simulated our setup using a finite-element-analysis approach. The parameters we used are shown in Table 1. To accommodate the influence of thermal radiation, which is quite evident in our experiments, we entered the relevant heat term in the silicon structure:

\[Q(T_{Si})_{rad}=Q_{bb}(T_{amb}^{4}-T_{Si}^{4}). \tag{2}\]

with \(T_{amb}\) the temperature of the vacuum vessel (\(\approx 26^{o}\)C) and \(T_{Si}\) the silicon temperature. \(Q_{bb}\) was fixed such as to reproduce the observed value of 190 \(\mu\)W/mm\({}^{2}\) at an ambient

\begin{tabular}{|c c c|} \hline material & thickness (\(\mu m\)) & conductivity (\(\frac{W}{mK}\)) \\ \hline silicon & 300 & 136 \\ TPG & 500 & 1700 \\ glue & 200 & 0.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

temperature of 16\({}^{o}\)C, in the absence of leakage currents. Our approximation clearly makes no allowance for the temperature inhomogeneities of the vacuum vessel, which was locally attached to the chilling element; nor does it take into account the different absorption coefficients of the various materials that make up the module itself.

The second module was better shielded when we performed the same measurements on it: we surrounded it with aluminized mylar foil to reflect much of the heat radiation impinging on it. We tried to take that into account in a more sophisticated simulation of radiative heating, and we made sure to take data at various temperatures in the absence of leakage current heating (i.e., while the detector was not powered). This procedure permitted us to determine the parameters for the relevant simulation term more realistically. The radiative heat was thus determined to be absorbed by the TPG bar at 5 times the rate observed in silicon:

\[Q(T_{TPG})_{rad}=5\times Q(T_{Si})_{rad*} \tag{3}\]

At a silicon temperature of -16\({}^{o}\)C and with an ambient temperature of 5\({}^{o}\)C, we reached good agreement with the simulation, which indicated the radiated power to be 77 \(\mu\)W/mm\({}^{2}\). We can then determine the heat generated in the silicon by leakage currents, using eq. 1, to be

\[Q(T)_{leakage}=Q_{0}\frac{T^{2}\exp(-E_{g}/2kT)}{T_{0}^{2}\exp(-E_{g}/2kT_{0} )}, \tag{4}\]

where \(T_{0}=273^{o}\)K.

## 5 Leakage currents

The free parameters in our simulation are \(Q_{0}\) and \(E_{g}\), the silicon gap width in our detector. They can be obtained from our fits to the observed leakage currents, given the bias voltage and the power deposited in the silicon. \(Q_{0}\) was then chosen to reproduce the the current measured when the cooling point temperature was fixed at 0\({}^{o}\)C. Fig. 4 shows the temperature dependence of the leakage current as measured by the thermocouple closest to the cooling point, and compares these data with simulations using three different parameter sets. The best fit is seen to yield

\[Q_{0} = 117\ \mu W/mm^{2}, \tag{5}\] \[E_{g} = 1.26\ eV\qquad\mbox{for detector 1,}\] (6) \[= 1.16\ eV\qquad\mbox{for detector 2.} \tag{7}\]

The value mentioned in the literature, for \(E_{g}\) in unirradiated silicon, is 1.1 eV. The gap width reported for the first sample coincides with that reported in ref. [4].

For detector 2, Fig, 4b shows a discrepancy between data and expectation due to the above parameter fits at low temperatures. We ascribe this feature, which does not persist at higher temperatures, to an extra surface current probably due to the glue. Thermal runaway, on the other hand, comes earlier (at about 3.8\({}^{\rm o}\)C) for detector 1 (Fig. 4a), while detector 2 takes off at 6\({}^{\rm o}\)C, just as our simulation has indicated it should. It stands to reason that the added mylar foil shielding adds stability to the array. For both detector samples, the value of \(Q_{0}=117\mu\)W/mm\({}^{2}\) is remarkably consistent with our expectations, and very close to the value of 120 \(\mu\)W/mm\({}^{2}\) reported in ref. [4]. This work also agrees with the observed \(E_{g}\) of 1.26 eV.

## 6 Temperature profiles

Fig. 5 shows the temperatures of the 6 thermocouples as a function of the measured leakage currents, and compares them with our simulations. The good agreement is evident. Next, we illustrate in Fig. 6 the thermal profiles of the two detectors: as the leakage current increases, the temperatures measured away from the cooling point increase more and more, until the heat generated by these currents leads to unstable operation.

The behavior is fairly well reproduced by our simulation, although there are discrepancies at lower current levels (where thermal radiation is still a factor, and neither our shielding nor our simulation are very reliable). To check this, we look (Fig. 7) at the temperature profiles as a function of the cooling point temperature: as we raise this reference temperature above about -2\({}^{o}\)C, the importance of radiative heat impact recedes, and the simulation becomes more reliable. Detector 2, with its better radiation shield and more careful simulation, shows the better agreement even at lower temperature, and is leakage-current dominated above about -5\({}^{o}\)C. The effect of the thermal radiation is shown in Fig. 8, where the contribution form leakage currents and thermal radiation are plotted separately (from simulations). For detector 1, which was not shielded, the leakage current contribution dominates for \(T_{c}>-3^{o}C\), whilst for detector 2 this occurs already at -5\({}^{o}C\).

## 7 Conclusions

We measured the thermal properties of a silicon-based vertex detector module using two identical samples irradiated by the same proton fluences. We then simulated the thermal profiles of these modules, the only difference of which was in their shielding from ambient blackbody radiation. Agreement of the simulations with the experimental evidence was good at temperatures where thermal radiation heating could be neglected w.r.t.heating by leakage current. In detector 1, without heat radiation shielding, thermal runaway occurs slightly below that expected from the simulation; detector 2 agrees with the simulation in its runaway data.

The most successful fits indicate gap widths of 1.26 eV for detector 1, 1.16 eV for detector 2. Irradiation has clearly changed the gap parameters; we surmise that thermal radiation causes the higher value resulting from the data on the unshielded detector 1. Still, for more general application, it will be safe to use \(E_{g}=1.26\) eV for the design of thermally stable detector configurations.
