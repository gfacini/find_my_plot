**Abstract**

Pollution measurements of liquid argon have been carried out at Grenoble under neutron irradiation. The signal loss due to impurities is recorded using an alpha cell immersed in the irradiation cryostat. The purpose of the note is to extrapolate the effect of the pollution observed on the signal shape and on the signal loss to the case of the ATLAS barrel EM calorimeter with fast readout electronics. When considering the proper amount of polluting material, the present data suggest that the induced signal drops should remain bellow 1% after 10 years of operation.

Introduction

The radiolysis of polymers is a well known phenomenon [1] which has been extensively studied for decades at normal temperatures: \(\sim\)20\({}^{\circ}\). Under cryogenic conditions like those we will face in the context of the liquid argon calorimetry of ATLAS, very few data if any are available. Here, the pollution yields for glass-epoxy components or other polymers such as kapton or pre-impregnated foils are in most cases completely unknown. For this reason and also to study directly in situ the signal drop of the liquid argon EM calorimeter, a cryostat was installed in the irradiation station of SARA [2] to expose, in a neutron beam, samples of polymers which will be used in the construction of the accordion calorimeter. The samples are immersed in 5 l of liquid argon together with an alpha cell whose function is to monitor the purity evolution during the irradiation. The samples are irradiated with measured fluences up to 2 10\({}^{14}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\). The average energy of the neutrons is 6 MeV. The purpose of this note is to describe how we can derive from our alpha cell measurements the EM calorimeter signal loss.

## 2 Signal of the alpha cell

Our alpha cell consists of two metallic disks separated by a liquid argon gap of 0.8 mm. An \({}^{241}\)Am source was deposited on the cathode. The anode signal is read by a charge preamplifier which is located outside the cryostat in a region exposed to smaller neutron fluences. The output of the charge preamplifier is further processed by a CR-RC filter with a 100 ns time constant and is finally digitized by a 12 bit charge ADC with a 100 ns gate centered on the maximum of the filter output. The value of the filter time constant was optimized to reduce the pile-up noise arising from the \({}^{41}\)Ar beta activity during the irradiation. A calibration pulse with a proper shape is injected at the input of the preamplifier to fully monitor the gain stability of the read-out chain. The pedestal of the chain is determined by randomly triggering the acquisition which is done by a PC equipped with a GPIB board.

The current pulse produced by an alpha particle at the input of the preamplifier is given by:

\[i(t)=i_{0}H(t_{d}-t)e^{-t\frac{s_{d}}{\lambda}}\mbox{ with }H(t_{d}-t)=1\mbox{ if }0 \leq t\leq t,0\mbox{ outside} \tag{1}\]

where \(t_{d}\) is the drift time, \(v_{d}\) the drift velocity and \(\lambda\) the absorption length of electrons drifting in the liquid argon gap. The voltage swing at the output of the preamplifier is :

\[v(t)=\begin{array}{l}\frac{Q,\lambda}{C_{f},D}(1-e^{-\frac{t,D}{t_{d}\lambda }})\mbox{ if }t<t_{d}\\ \frac{Q,\lambda}{C_{f},D}(1-e^{-\frac{D}{\lambda}})\mbox{ \ \ if }t\geq t_{d}\end{array} \tag{2}\]

where \(Q=i_{0}.t_{d}\) and \(D\) is the gap width. In the frequency domain, this expression becomes:

\[v(s)=L(v(t))=\int_{0}^{\infty}v(t)e^{-st}dt=V_Then, the final shape of the alpha signal as seen at the output of the filter is obtained in the frequency domain by the product:

\[v_{out}(s)=v(s)H(s)=v(s)\frac{s.\tau_{sh}}{(1+s.\tau_{sh})^{2}}, \tag{4}\]

where \(\tau_{sh}\) is the time constant of the filter. In the time domain, the same signal is determined by taking the inverse Laplace transform of \(v_{out}(s)\), namely:

\[v_{out}(t)=L^{-1}(v_{out}(t))=L^{-1}(V_{0}\frac{1-e^{-(s.t_{d}+D/\lambda)}}{s. t_{d}+D/\lambda}.\frac{\tau_{sh}}{(1+s.\tau_{sh})^{2}}). \tag{5}\]

This expression was computed with the help of Mathematica. Figure 1 shows the result obtained in our configuration: \(D\)= 0.8 mm, \(\tau_{sh}\)=100 ns, \(t_{d}\)=160 ns (E=1 kV/mm), with two different values of the absorption length. The resulting shape is in very good agreement with the one measured. By evaluating the signal loss through the ratio \(v_{out}^{m\,ax.}(\lambda)/v_{out}^{m\,ax.}(\lambda=\infty)\), it was realized that this lengthy procedure is equivalent with a good precision to using the simple expression:

\[v_{out}^{m\,ax.}(\lambda)/v_{out}^{m\,ax.}(\lambda=\infty)=\frac{\lambda}{D}( 1-e^{-D/\lambda}). \tag{6}\]

In other words, our read-out chain almost behaves as a charge integrator since the above expression is in principle only valid when the total charge is collected. In the following, this simplified expression will be used to extract the absorption length for a given signal attenuation.

Absorption length as a function of the electrical field

In liquid argon, the absorption length of drifting electrons is known to be a function of the electrical field. When the pollutant is oxygen, \(\lambda\) is proportional to \(E\) according to [3]:

\[\lambda(E)=\alpha E(\mathrm{kV/mm})/\rho(\mathrm{ppm})\;\;\mathrm{where}\;\; \alpha=14\pm 3\;\mathrm{ppm\;mm^{2}\;/kV}. \tag{7}\]

However, one may find other pollutants as for instance N\({}_{2}\)O [4], for which the absorption length contrarily decreases with \(E\) due to an attachment cross section which increases as a function of the drifting electron energy. To be able to safely extrapolate the signal attenuation measured with our alpha cell to the case of the EM calorimeter, the absorption length is measured as a function of the electrical field. This curve is obtained by recording the signal height as a function of the electrical field before and after the irradiation and by making use of the following expression:

\[v_{out}^{after}(E)/v_{out}^{before}(E)=\frac{\lambda(E)}{D}(1-e^{-D/\lambda(E)}). \tag{8}\]

An example of this curve is shown in Fig. 2 which corresponds to the irradiation of FR4 plates covered with polymerized prepreg foils as those which will be used to build the presampler modules [5]. Note the decreasing profile of \(\lambda\) as a function of \(E\) suggesting that the pollutant is not oxygen.

Extrapolation to the EM calorimeter signal

For the case of an electromagnetic shower which produces an ionized charge evenly distributed in the liquid argon gap, the input current pulse in a polluted liquid is given in the frequency domain by the expression:

\[v(s)=\frac{i_{0}.t_{d}}{s.t_{d}+g/\lambda}(1+\frac{e^{-(s.t_{d}+g/\lambda)}-1}{s.t_{d}+g/\lambda}), \tag{9}\]

where \(g\) is the gap width (2 mm in the case of the barrel accordion) and \(\lambda\) is the absorption length. The signal is primarily integrated with a time constant \(\tau_{0T}\) given by the product of the detector capacitance by the characteristic impedance of the signal cold lead, and then processed by a CR-RC [2] fast filter to get rid of the slow fall of the pulse. The total transfer function reads:

\[H(s)=\frac{R_{f}}{1+s.\tau_{0T}}\frac{s.\tau_{sh}}{(1+s.\tau_{sh})^{3}}\;. \tag{10}\]

The output pulse expressed in the time domain is obtained by taking the inverse Laplace transform of \(v_{out}(s)\), that is:

\[v_{out}(t)=L^{-1}(v_{out}(s))=L^{-1}(v(s)H(s))\;. \tag{11}\]

Again this operation was achieved using Mathematica. Two extreme examples are presented in Fig. 3 for the case of \(\lambda=\infty\) and 2.18 mm. Apart from a signal drop one may also note that a polluted pulse features both a slightly faster peaking time and a modified shape of its trailer.

The extrapolated signal drop of the calorimeter results from the calculation of the ratio \(v_{out}^{m\,ax.}(\lambda(1\,kV/mm))/v_{out}^{m\,ax}(\lambda=\infty)\) with the proper parameters corresponding to

Figure 3: Output signal of the calorimeter with fast analog electronics for \(\lambda=\infty\) and 2.18 mm

the calorimeter configuration: \(g\)=2 mm, \(\tau_{0T}\)=22 ns (440 pF,50 \(\Omega\)), \(\tau_{sh}\)=16 ns, \(t_{d}\)=400 ns, \(E\)=1 kV/mm. For the case presented in the previous section (FR4 plates covered with prepreg foils [5]), the attenuation of the calorimeter signal is 5.4 % while it was measured at 16.5 % at 1 kV/mm with our alpha cell. Indeed this approach is only valid under the hypothesis in which there is no dilution nor any concentration of the pollution in the ATLAS cryostat with respect to what was obtained in the test cryostat, and for which the amount of tested material per liter of liquid is roughly the same in both situations. Knowing the presampler mechanical structure, we are entitled to say that the latter condition is far too pessimistic for the FR4/prepreg test. There was more than 20 times more FR4/prepreg per liter of liquid argon in this pollution test than in the ATLAS cryostat. This leads to an absorption length which for the EM calorimeter should be bigger than 44 mm. Figure 4 shows that if the attenuation length exceeds 20 mm, its effect on the calorimeter signal may be neglected.

## 5 Conclusion

The shape of our alpha signal is well understood, and with a good approximation the output voltage measured at its maximum provides us with a measurement of the total charge collected in the cell. Thus, the classical expression (6) may be used to extract the absorption length of the polluted liquid as a function of the electrical field. We have calculated the shape and the attenuation factor (Fig. 4) of the electromagnetic calorimeter signal knowing \(\lambda\) from the data taken on our alpha cell at \(E\)=1 kV/mm. We essentially note that for a given absorption length, there is three times less signal drop in the calorimeter than in our alpha cell. A slight change in the peaking time (Fig. 5) of the calorimeter signal together with a modification of the after-pulse shape may also be caused by a pollution of the liquid. The effect on the calorimeter signal of the pollution due to the irradiation of FR4/prepreg plates may be neglected if we consider the real amount of this material in the ATLAS cryostat.
