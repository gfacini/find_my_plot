The description of the Quality Assurance and Quality Control (QA_QC) procedure, the quality parameters verification and the obtained results are presented for the construction of the BIS-Module-0 Monitored Drift Tubes. In total 280 tubes have been tested at the NTU.

## 1 Introduction

The production scheme of the BIS-Module-0 Monitored Drift Tubes (MDT) includes tube production, laser welding and QA_QC tests. The MDTs have been wired at the University of Athens, High Energy Physics Laboratory, they were shipped to the Laser Innovative Centre (LIC-FORTH, Koropi Attikis) for the end-plug laser welding and then they were transferred at the NTU for the QA_QC procedure.

The critical aspects of an MDT, in order to be accepted as a particle detector for the ATLAS muon spectrometer are:

* A leak rate less than 10\({}^{-8}\) bar \(\times\) litre / sec for a 3 bar (absolute) gas filled tube.
* A precise wire location with respect to the reference surface of the end-plug less than 25 \(\upmu\)m (10 \(\upmu\)m r.m.s.) in both transverse coordinates.
* A wire tension which is required to stay within a tolerance \(\pm\)5% of the nominal value of 350 gf at the nominal temperature of 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C.
* A very low leak current (2 nA/m) at the high voltage operation of 3.4 kV with the proper gas mixture.

The NTU QA_QC facility can test one MDT, at a time, measuring the wire tension, the HV leakage current and the wire position. The gas tightness set-up tests up to 80 tubes simultaneously.

The wire tension is measured via the CAEN SY502 module [1] and a permanent magnet, where data are taken due to the resonant oscillations of the wire excited by a square current in presence of the magnetic field. The resonance frequency (fundamental) is measured and the tension force is calculated.

The HV leakage current is measured by a 2000 electrometer [2], used as voltmeter to measure the voltage drop across an 1 M\(\Omega\) resistor in series with the tube, when the tube is supplied by the gas mixture Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) (93:7) at 3 bar pressure (absolute) and high tension of 3400 V to the MDT corresponding to the gas gain of 16\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\).

The wire position is obtained via the ROME I - PAVIA electromagnetic micrometer (EMMI) [3], where inductive signals are measured on coils on both ends of the tube.

The gas leak-rate measurement is performed by filling 80 tubes simultaneously with a gas mixture of Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) (93:7) at 4 bar pressure (absolute) via a set-up of equivalent number of valves, which are in parallel connected to a pressure meter. The temperature is recorded during the filling, with an accuracy of 0.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C for the measurement of the first 154 tubes of the 280 tubes measured in total, and an accuracy of 0.1 \({}^{\circ}\)C for the rest of them.

Finally, 280 tubes have been fully tested at the NTU following this procedure of which 240 tubes were used for the BIS module-0 building. All the data from these measurements are stored in an MS-Access database.

## 2 Wire Tension

The gravitational sag of the wires has to be controlled within a tolerance of \(\pm\)10 \(\upmu\)m in order to know the wire position between the tube ends with sufficient accuracy.

The wire sag is related to the wire tension and to the ground mode wire oscillation frequency (from which we can determine the wire tension).

The wire tension is required to stay within a tolerance of \(\pm\)5% of the nominal value of 350 gf at the nominal temperature of 20\(\pm 1\)\({}^{\circ}\)C (the wire ground mode frequency has to stay within \(\pm\)2.5% of the nominal value). During the tension measurements the tube temperature was controlled and measured with this accuracy.

The wire tension of the tube is measured with a wire stretch meter provided by CAEN (module SY502), where data are taken due to the resonant oscillations of the wire excited by a square current in presence of a magnetic field.

The wire stretch meter determines the oscillation frequency (f) of the fundamental mode wire vibration and evaluates the wire tension (T):

\[\mathrm{T}=\pi\mathrm{\rho}\mathrm{d}^{2}\mathrm{L}^{2}\mathrm{f}^{2}\qquad \qquad\mathrm{(S.I.)}\]

The CAEN module accepts, input data: the wire length (L=165 cm), the wire diameter (d=50 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\)) and the density (p=19,3 gr/cm\({}^{3}\)) of the wire material (W-Rh), processes them and gives back the wire tension and the frequency, using a LabVIEW code.

The magnetic field is provided by a permanent magnet (55 \(\times\) 45 \(\times\) 60 mm\({}^{3}\)) made of Alcomex (CERN seem 08.14.01.340.4) [4] or by an alternative permanent magnet (70 \(\times\) 50 \(\times\) 30 mm\({}^{3}\)) of about 2.7 kG (PASCO seem WA-9609A) [5].

The set-up of the wire tension meter (magnet and CAEN module) has been checked and verified by a calibration system designed at the NTU. The calibration system is based on an accurate and horizontal stand. In that stand a similar anode wire of the same length (165 cm) has been stretched with a highly accurate weight of 350 g increased by an additional accurate weight of 100 g, applied only for a few minutes. The wire tension measurement of the calibration system resulted, with the above CAENmodule and magnet, fits the applied weight within the error less than 1 %. The measurements have been extended by applying oscillation frequencies to the wire of second and next order mode and/or of different shape pulses.

It should also be reported that the CAEN module has been checked and confirmed the operation, at NTU, in its electronic circuit in order to calibrate it with an individual simple designed and constructed at NTU electronic device that provides a very well stabilised square waveform of 50 Hz.

The CAEN module should be in operation at least for 15 minutes before starting any measurement for reasons of temperature stabilisation of the module. The permanent magnet edges have been very close of the tube wall and about in the middle its length.

The obtained measurements of the wire tension normalised to the nominal temperature of 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C (see Appendix I) are presented in the figure 1. They have a mean value of 346.8 gf and 4.4 gf r.m.s. Only 0.4% of the tested tubes have been rejected, because they were exceeded the \(\pm\)5% variation. The obtained measurements of the wire frequency normalised to the nominal temperature of 20 \({}^{\circ}\)C is presented in the figure 2. The mean value of the wire frequency is 91.1 Hz and 0.6 Hz r.m.s.

## 3 Laser Welding

The MD Tubes have been welded, on both ends, by a high power Ne-YAG laser beam at 8 points symmetrically distributed around the end-plug circumference, on purpose to get good electrical connection between the end-plug and the cylinder.

_Figure 3 : The plot shows all the tube end to end resistance measurements. The units of the above plot are in \(m\Omega\)._The laser spots are located at the last crimped "ring" of the cylinder, which is produced during the tube wiring.

The Laser Innovative Center team applied two combinations of the laser parameters concerning the pulse duration and the energy intensity on each spot. The first combination had a laser pulse duration of 10 ms and an energy intensity of 27.8 J, while the second had 15 ms duration and 19 J energy.

The resistance, of the order of m\(\Omega\), between the two end-plugs has been measured by applying an 1A, DC current. The obtained data, corrected with respect to the end-plug own resistance (about 4 m\(\Omega\)), are presented in the figure 3.

Measurements on a few dozens of tubes before and after the welding showed that there was not any significant change on the resistance. This was further justified by extracting the end-plugs from some welded tubes. It was observed that there was not any spot due to the laser beam on the surface of the end-plugs.

## 4 HV Leakage Current

The High Voltage leakage current is measured by a KEITHLEY 2000 electrometer. The electric circuit, which has been used for the HV leakage current measurements, is attached at the Appendix II.

The tube is filled with a gas mixture Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) (93:7) at 3 bar pressure (absolute), and then HV is applied up to 3400 V (gas gain 16\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\)). The obtained measurements from the

electrometer are presented in the figure 4, where only the tubes with leakage current less than 3.4 nA have been accepted. In total 27 tubes have not been accepted (9,6 %).

## 5 Wire Location

The wire position inside the MDT tube with respect to the centre of the end-plug reference surface has been measured via the ROME I - PAVIA electromagnetic micrometer (EMMI) for both end-plugs at four equidistant angular positions (at 0\({}^{\circ}\), 90\({}^{\circ}\), 180\({}^{\circ}\), 270\({}^{\circ}\) around the end-plug axis). The EMMI device consists of:

* Two V-block holders, each with two coils between which the MDT tube is placed.
* A signal generation board, which provides the tube wire with an oscillating current.
* Two read-out boards, which read out the signal induced on the coils.

The differential signal between the coils on the sides of a tube end is proportional to the wire position in the tube. The achieved reconstructed wire displacement has been found with an accuracy of 4 \(\upmu\)m.

The measured values coming from processing the signals with differential and lock-in amplifiers, housed on the read-out boards, are measured via digital voltmeters and then are transferred to the data-base.

The electronic part of the EMMI set-up (signal generation board and read-out board) has been adjusted in phase, amplitude and offset and has been calibrated by the manufacturer.

The position calibration function giving the relation between the measured signal in mV and the shift of the wire, with respect to the centre of the tube, in microns, has been obtained with the help of two mechanical gauges (MITUYOMO dial indicator), mounted to each coil.

In addition, 3 reference tubes have been used to obtain an additional correction factor per each coil. Small holes have been opened symmetrically at the two ends of the tube and the wire position was measured in these tubes via a very high quality microscope on different angles (0\({}^{\circ}\), 90\({}^{\circ}\), 180\({}^{\circ}\) and 270\({}^{\circ}\)).

The data obtained for the wire position measurement are presented in the figure 5, where the tubes with the wire displacement less than or equal to 25 \(\upmu\)m from the tube axis in z and y directions, corresponding to 2.5 times the required 10 \(\upmu\)m (r.m.s.), were accepted. Only 2 tubes have not been accepted (0,7 %).

The distance between the end-plug and the middle of the coil where the wire position has been measured is 27 cm. The extrapolation of the measured wire position by the EMMI device at the distance of 27 cm from the tube end to the wire locator can be expanded normally introducing no further problems. This statement is not valid for tubes with the very short length. [6].

At the figure 6 the wire position measurements for the z and y co-ordinates for both ends are shown, while at the figure 7 the radial shift \(r\) from the centre for the two ends of each tube is shown.

Figure 5: The wire position measurements for the \(z\) and \(y\) co-ordinates and the radial shift \(r\) from the axis for the two ends of each tube (\(z_{l}\), \(y_{l}\), \(r_{l}\) and \(z_{2}\), \(y_{2}\), \(r_{2}\)) respectively. The number 1 indicates the tube edge, which is closer to the barcode stamp. The \(y\)-axis is parallel to the line, which connects the two holes (for the electronics) at the end-plugs. The units of these plots are in \(\mu\)m.

## 5 Gas Leak-Rate

The gas leak-rate set-up used in these tests is described in the ATLAS Note MUON-No-200 [7], where up to 80 tubes are connected in parallel to a 200 bar gas bottle with the Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) (93:7) mixture. A block design of the set-up is shown in the figure 8. All tubes are pressurised at 4 bar pressure (absolute) and subsequently the input valves on each tube are closed. The initial pressure, P\({}_{\rm o}=4000\) mbar, and temperature, T\({}_{\rm o}=300\) K, are recorded. The pressure measurement precision was 5 mbar, while for the temperature measurement a device of 0.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C accuracy was used for the first 154 tubes and a device of 0.1 \({}^{\circ}\)C accuracy was used for the rest 126 of them.

measured 4 days under pressure and 0.3\(\times\)10\({}^{-8}\) bar \(\times\)1 / s for tubes measured 6 days under pressure. The obtained measurements are presented in the figures 9 and 10.

The tubes are classified, at the figures 11 and 12, according to the time at which they have been measured under pressure and the corresponding temperature precision. The gas leak rate measurements are expected to become better as the time increases and the temperature precision is improved, which is not clearly seen in these figures.

The obtained gas leak rate measurements have given the following results:

\begin{tabular}{c c c}
**Number of tubes** & **Gas Leak Rate (bar\(\times\)L/s)** \\
69 (24,6 \%) & Gas Leak Rate\(>\) 3\(\times\)10\({}^{-7}\) \\
183 (65,4 \%) & 10 \({}^{-8}\) \(<\) Gas Leak Rate \(<\) 3\(\times\)10\({}^{-7}\) \\
28 (10 \%) & Gas Leak Rate \(<\) 10 \({}^{-8}\) \\ \end{tabular}

Figure 9: The Gas leak rate measurements for BIS module-0. Figure 10 : The distribution of gas leak rate measurements in logarithmic scale [Log\({}_{10}\)( Gas leak rate)( bar\(\times\)l/s)].

Based upon the above remarks plus on our calculations, we decided to check our manifold system tightness, which was measured not better than \(10^{-7}\) bar \(\times\) 1 / s, as it is according to the manufacturer's specification.

Afterwards the tubes with gas leak rate worst than \(10^{-7}\) bar \(\times\) 1 / s were visually inspected and tested for gas leak rate by water bubbles. (see Appendix III).

In conclusion, the applied system for the gas leak rate measurement could be effective using the appropriate manifold system (tightness of the order of \(10^{-10}\) bar \(\times\) 1 / s), but the duration of the measurements in order to achieve the required gas leak rate of \(10^{-8}\) bar \(\times\) 1 / s would be too long and inconvenient for the massive test procedure. So we plan to replace this set-up using a differential manometer, a reference volume and a new manifold with better specifications, in order to reduce the measuring time and improve the quality level of gas leak rate measurement, for the next BIS production module (see Appendix IV). In addition, these measurements will take place in a controlled room with temperature uniformity in order to assure more accurate measurements.
