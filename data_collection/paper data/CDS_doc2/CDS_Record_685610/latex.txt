###### Abstract

The effect of gas gain saturation caused by a local space charge in the avalanche has been studied. An MDT filled with \(Ar:N_{2}:CH_{4}\) (91:5:4) gas mixture and alpha particles as a source of ionization have been used. An extrapolation of the obtained results to the working conditions of the ATLAS muon system predicts a reduction of the gas gain for minimum ionizing particles.

## 1 Introduction

The recent studies [1], [2] have shown that at certain conditions background particles can produce an extremely large primary ionization (up to 1 MeV of corresponding energy loss) in the drift tubes of the ATLAS Muon System [3]. Such events can originate from Compton scattering of few MeV photons in the MDT gas when the recoil electron is curled around the magnetic field lines and deposits its whole energy in the sensitive volume. Another possible mechanism is neutron interaction with nuclei when protons with rather high energy and small rang can be produced.

Our simulation shows that a considerable part of MDT background signals comes from events with large ionization (hundreds keV or even few MeV). However in ourprevious studies of drift tube response we have not observed signals with amplitudes higher than 200 - 300 keV when irradiating a drift tube by fast neutrons [2] or by 1.25 MeV photons in \(\sim\)1 T magnetic field [1].

We ascribed this to a local drop of gas gain due to the effect of avalanche saturation or the so-called limited proportional mode. However in the works mentioned above we did not investigate this effect thoroughly but made only qualitative estimations.

The detailed study of such saturation effect is important for the ATLAS muon spectrometer for at least two following reasons. First, this effect can significantly influence the prediction of the MDT background current which is important for the choice of operating point from the aging point of view. The other reason is that even minimum ionising particles can produce rather high density of primary ionization per unit wire length if the particle goes perpendicularly to the wire. In this case the real signals would be smaller than it is expected.

The goal of the present work was to perform a quantitative study of gas gain saturation effect in MDT. The next section describes our experimental setup. The experimental results are presented in the third section. It is followed by a discussion and the main results are summarised in the last section.

## 2 Experimental setup

To study the avalanche saturation effect one needs events with well known large ionization density with a possibility to vary it.

Due to the above reasons we have chosen alpha particles from \({}^{238}Pu\) as a source of ionization. This source provides 5.499 MeV \(\alpha\)-particles with the range in argon of about 14 mm at 3 bar pressure. Therefore the whole particle energy is deposited in the MDT producing the well known primary ionization. Alpha rays can be easily collimated that is also important for our study.

The experimental setup is presented schematically in fig.1 We used a standart ATLAS MDT tube. It was filled with \(Ar:N_{2}:CH_{4}\) (91:5:4) gas mixture at 3 bar pressure. To make it possible for alpha particles to enter the gas volume a circular window of 3 mm in diameter was drilled in the tube wall. The window was irradiated by alpha particles through a Plexiglas collimator. The collimator, the radioactive source and the drilled part of the tube were covered with a gas sealing container.

The procedure of the signal amplitude measurement were essentially the same as in [1]. The precision of the signal amplitude measurement was estimate as a quadratic sum of two terms: \(\sim\) 1 ADC channel due to pedestal instability and \(\sim\) 2% of signal amplitude due to pressure instability.

## 3 Results

### Spectra from uncollimated alpha rays

Fig.2 presents the ADC spectra of signals from \({}^{238}Pu\) source at different voltages. In these measurements the alpha rays were not collimated and the gas pressure was 3 bar. One can see that at the voltage of 2200 V the spectrum is a rather symmetrical Gaussian peak. With the increase of voltage a left shoulder appears near the main peak. At higher voltages the additional peak grows and its position with respect to the right edge of the spectrum is shifted leftward. With further increase of voltage (2700 V) the left peak becomes dominant.

The observed effect could be explained in the following way. The additional left peak is formed by the saturated signals with reduced amplitudes, while the right part of the spectrum contains the signals with the "nominal" gas gain. The saturation arises due to the screening of the anode wire by positive ions of an avalanche. If the alpha particle track is inclined to the wire the ions are distributed over the longer length of wire and the screening is smaller. It explains the co-existence of saturated and unsaturated signals in the same spectrum.

This hypothesis could be checked using collimated alpha rays with different inclinations to the anode wire. The results of such study are described in the following paragraphs.

### Results with collimated alpha rays

Six Plexiglas collimators used in our measurements were 2.5 mm thick. 0.5 mm in diameter channels were drilled trough the collimators at angles 0, 12, 20, 30, 45 and 60 degrees to the normal. The measured signal amplitude was corrected for the energy losses in the collimator. The dE/dx losses of alpha particles were taken from

[4].

Fig.3 illustrates the ADC spectra measured at 2400 V voltage. The spectra measured with three different collimators (oriented in plane with the tube wire) are compared with the spectrum measured with the split collimator (Plexiglas disc with 0.5 mm width and 1 cm length slot parallel to wire ).

The spectra in fig.3 are in agreement with the hypothesis that the signal saturation depends on the track inclination to the wire. The measurements of amplitude

(corrected for the energy loss inside the collimator) at different voltages and angles are summarised in fig.4, where the signal amplitudes (corrected for the ionization loss) are plotted versus the voltage for different collimators and in fig.5, where signal amplitudes are plotted versus incident angle for different voltages. It should be noted that points presented in the plots are the positions of the main peak in the spectrum.

The signal amplitude with all collimators are almost equal (after correction for the lost ionization) at 2000 V. In increasing the voltage the points corresponding to different angles diverge, so one can conclude that the saturation increases with the decrease of incident track angle. Similarly, one can see that the saturation more prominent for higher values of applied voltage.

Since the gas gain saturation is caused by positive ions screening the signal wire, the main parameter describing this effect should be the linear (per wire length)

avalanche charge density. The linear avalanche density can be varied in two ways: by changing the incident angle of track and applying the different values of high voltage. One can introduce a saturation factor as follows:

\[\alpha=\frac{G_{meas}}{G_{expect}},\]

here \(G_{meas}\) is the actual value of gas gain whereas \(G_{expect}\) is the gas gain without saturation (see below for details).

Fig.6 represents the dependence of \(\alpha\) versus linear avalanche density expressed in number of electrons per 1\(\mu\)m of wire. The points correspond to different values of high voltage and inclined angle. All points lie on the single curve in a good approximation, consequently one can conclude the function \(\alpha\) to be independent on the high voltage applied to a drift tube.

### Determination of the expected gas gain

Due to the extremely large energy deposition of alpha particles we were forced to operate the drift tube at unusually low voltages. So, our first problem was to determine the gas gain value as a function of the high voltage. We have solved it using the well known current method of gas gain determination. The principle of this method is to measure the current from the irradiated drift tube and the tube counting rate. Dividing the current by the counting rate and by the known ionization one could obtain the avalanche multiplication coefficient. However, such method is dangerous for the job whose goal is to study the avalanche saturation. In this way one can measure the gas gain in a saturated avalanche, that is not as exactly as what was desired. Therefore this method is adequate at low voltages only where the saturation is known to be absent. Looking at fig.2 one can conclude the saturation to be negligible up to 2300 V. We have performed the gas gain measurements for

the voltage range 1900 - 2300 V and extrapolated obtained data for higher voltages. The results of this measurement are shown in figure 7. This figure allows us to conclude that we performed the measurements with the \(\alpha\)-particles at 20\(\div\)1000 gas gain.

## 4 Discussion

The observed phenomenon have a significant influence on the MDT chamber operation. Since in the ATLAS muon spectrometer muon tracks are almost perpendicular to the sensitive wires, the produced linear charge density is relatively large and it can essentially affect the effective gas gain. In assumption that the unsaturated gas gain is describes by the following equation

\[G_{expect}=A\exp(BV),\]

Figure 6: Saturation factor _vs_ linear charge density of avalanche.

where V is the high voltage, the effective gas gain for muon track perpendicular to the wire is

\[G_{meas}=A\exp(BV)\cdot\alpha(\rho A\exp(BV)).\]

\(\rho\) is the linear charge density of primary ionization projected onto the wire. Calculations of \(G_{meas}\) and \(G_{expect}\) versus high voltage are shown in fig 8. We used \(A=4.03\cdot 10^{-4}\), \(B=5.4\cdot 10^{-3}\)\(V^{-1}\) (DACHA gas), avalanche spread along the wire \(500\mu\)m.

From this plot one can conclude that for expected gas gain \(2\cdot 10^{4}\) the effective gain of a signal for perpendicular muon track is approximately two times less.

The similar effect was described in [5] for high energy protons, pions and electrons. The ratio of \((dE/dx)_{meas.}\) to \((dE/dx)_{expect.}\) versus ion-pair density of incident particles projected onto the sense wire \(((dE/dx)_{meas.}/\sin(\theta))\) is shown in fig.9.

These results are consistent with the our observation. It demonstrate that gas gain saturation exists not only for \(\alpha\)-particles, producing huge primary ionization,

but also for the minimal ionising particles, which is important for the MDT chambers.

## 5 Conclusions

The well known effect of gas gain saturation was studied in the single ATLAS MDT tube using 5.499 MeV alpha-particles. Observed an unambiguous dependence of gas gain on avalanche linear density. In particular it has been found that saturation factor \(\alpha=\frac{G_{meas}}{G_{expect}}\) describes by one variable, constructed from applied voltage, track projection onto the signal wire and number of electrons in primary ionization. This variable is linear charge density of avalanche.

Using these measurements with alpha-particles one might extrapolate the results

to the ATLAS MDT conditions. At ATLAS MDT conditions factor of 2 gas gain reduction is expected for the muon tracks perpendicular to the wire. Average gas gain drop over the chamber is expected to be 20%.

A direct test will be done in the muon test beam in the near future.
