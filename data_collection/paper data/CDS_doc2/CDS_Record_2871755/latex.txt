Inclusive \(W^{\pm}\) and \(Z^{0}\) production cross sections at next-to-next-to leading order QCD for the ATLAS experiment

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note presents the evaluation of the cross sections for the production of single electroweak vector bosons (\(W\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)) in proton-proton collisions using state-of-the-art calculations for use in the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider. The calculations are performed with a focus on the LHC Run 3 centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13.6\,\mathrm{\TeV}\) and in the phase space of the most common ATLAS Monte Carlo samples. Calculations for the centre-of-mass energies of 5.02, 7, 8, 13, and 14 TeV are also provided. The calculations are performed up to next-to-next-to leading order in the strong coupling and up to next-to-leading order in the electroweak coupling. Uncertainties on the predictions are evaluated from the variation of perturbative scales and from the parton density function sets used. Cross sections for different values of the strong coupling and with the effects of photon induced parton density functions included are also provided. The results from this note will be used for setting the normalisation of the Monte Carlo simulations for single electroweak production in ATLAS analyses.

## 1 Introduction

The production of a single electroweak vector boson (\(W\) or \(Z/\gamma^{*}\), collectively referred to as \(V\)) at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is of fundamental theoretical and experimental importance. The leptonic decays of \(V\) bosons provide a clean experimental signature to allow the precise determination of Standard Model (SM) electroweak parameters as well as tests of perturbative quantum chromodynamics (pQCD). For example, the Drell-Yan (DY) production of \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) boson to lepton pairs is used in the calibration of numerous components of the ATLAS experiment [1, 2, 3]. Furthermore, the relatively large cross section for \(V\) boson production means they are often an important irreducible contribution to measurements of final states involving high momentum leptons and/or large missing transverse energy. For example, in measurements of Higgs bosons [4, 5] and top quark [6, 7] processes as well as in searches for new physics beyond the Standard Model [8, 9, 10]. The analyses often rely on the use of Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the description of \(W\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) processes and a detailed description of the latest generators and event generation techniques used by ATLAS is given in a recent paper [11]. In addition to the highest possible statistical precision and perturbative accuracy across a wide phase space provided by the generators themselves, it is desirable for the analyses to set the normalisation of the simulations to the best known theoretical accuracy. Similarly, up-to-date values for the theoretical uncertainties for the normalisation of the cross section are required for the evaluation of systematic uncertainties in ATLAS measurements.

In this note, cross section predictions for inclusive single boson production and the associated theoretical uncertainties to the highest possible accuracy in both the strong coupling \(\alpha_{s}\) and the electroweak (EW) coupling are provided. The predictions are calculated in a phase space matching that of the most common inclusive \(V\) MC samples used by the ATLAS collaboration. With the Run 3 of the LHC at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13.6\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) currently ongoing, the most detailed calculations are tabulated for this energy and central values are given for other centre-of-mass energies, namely 5.02, 7, 8, 13 and \(14\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\).

Predictions are provided for the following processes

\[pp\to e^{+}e^{-},\ \ \ pp\to\nu_{e}\bar{\nu}_{e}\,,\ \ \ pp\to e^{-}\bar{\nu}_{e}\,,\ \ \ pp\to e^{+}\nu_{e}\,,\]

using the MATRIXv2[12] program which can compute cross sections up to next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) QCD and next-to leading order (NLO) electroweak [13], and combine them by means of a multiplicative prescription [14]. The calculations involving charged leptons are done for electrons only in order to save computational time but the results can be used for decays involving muons or tau leptons as well, neglecting the very small differences due to the lepton masses. Similarly, the process involving the decay to two neutrinos is calculated for the electron neutrino only and, for the total cross section, the cross section should be multiplied by a factor of 3.

Central values of the cross sections at leading order (LO), NLO and NNLO QCD, with and without NLO EW corrections are provided. Uncertainties on the cross section arising from missing higher orders, variation of \(\alpha_{s}\), and variations of the input parton distribution functions (PDFs) are also provided. Contributions from photon induced channels are also assessed.

In addition, the cross sections are computed with the same NNLO QCD + NLO EW accuracy using the DYTurbo-1.3.1[15, 16, 17, 18] and ReneSANCe-1.3.3[19, 20] programs. The DYTurbo program provides fast calculations for the Drell-Yan process including the QCD resummation of transverse momentum and is used here to validate the inclusive cross section results obtained using MATRIXv2.

## 2 Calculation settings

In this section the parameters used to calculate the single boson production cross sections are provided. These include the SM input parameters, the choice of electroweak, mass and flavour schemes as well as the PDF sets used. All results are computed using MATRIXv2.

### Input parameters

Table 1 summarizes the Standard Model input parameters used in the computations. These are also reported in Section 5.1 of the MATRIXv2 documentation [12].

An EW input scheme defines the set of input parameters which are used to derive any remaining EW parameters. Here, the so-called \(G_{\mu}\) scheme is employed, specified by the Fermi constant \(G_{\mu}\) and the mass of the \(Z\) and \(W\) boson denoted \(m_{Z}\) and \(m_{W}\), respectively.

When considering leptonic final states produced via off-shell EW bosons, the complex \(W\)- and \(Z\)-boson masses are used and the EW mixing angle is defined as \(\cos\theta_{W}^{2}=\left(m_{W}^{2}-i\Gamma_{W}m_{W}\right)/\left(m_{Z}^{2}-i \Gamma_{Z}m_{Z}\right)\) and \(\alpha=\sqrt{2}\,G_{\mu}\,m_{W}^{2}\,sin^{2}\theta_{W}/\pi\). All processes considered here apply the five flavour number scheme with a vanishing bottom quark mass \(m_{b}=0\).

The CKM matrix is set to unity, except for the production of a single \(W^{\pm}\) boson, in which case the following SM values [21] are used

\[\begin{bmatrix}V_{ud}&V_{us}&V_{ub}\\ V_{cd}&V_{cs}&V_{cb}\\ V_{td}&V_{ts}&V_{tb}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}0.97417&0.2248&0.00409\\ 0.22&0.995&0.0405\\ 0.0082&0.04&1.009\end{bmatrix}.\]

### Input PDFs and related uncertainties

Cross section calculations are provided for the state-of-the-art PDF sets, as detailed below and summarized in Table 2. For each set, the main features are described and the prescription used to compute the PDF uncertainty of the predictions at a particular order is given.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Parameter & Value \\ \hline \(m_{W}\) & 80.385 GeV \\ \(\Gamma_{W}\) & 2.0854 GeV \\ \(m_{Z}\) & 91.1876 GeV \\ \(\Gamma_{Z}\) & 2.4952 GeV \\ \(m_{H}\) & 125 GeV \\ \(\Gamma_{H}\) & 0.00407 GeV \\ \(m_{t}\) & 173.2 GeV \\ \(\Gamma_{t}\) & 1.44262 GeV \\ \(G_{F}\) & 1.16639 \(\times 10^{-5}\) GeV\({}^{-2}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Electroweak input parameters used for the calculation of inclusive electroweak vector boson cross sections, where \(m\) denotes the particle mass and \(\Gamma\) the total width.

PDF4LHC21:Presented in Ref. [22]. Only NNLO grids are provided which are therefore also used for the LO and NLO calculations. The Hessian eigenvector set denoted as _PDF4LHC21_40_pdfas_ is used. The PDF uncertainty for a predicted cross section, denoted as \(\mathcal{F}^{(k)}\), is computed by summing over the 40 eigenvectors as follows

\[\delta^{\text{pdf}}\mathcal{F}=\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\text{elg}}}\left( \mathcal{F}^{(k)}-\mathcal{F}^{(0)}\right)^{2}}\,, \tag{1}\]

and gives the 68% CL uncertainty according to the symmetric Hessian prescription.

CTEQ18:Presented in Ref. [23]. NLO and NNLO grids are provided for the central fit and 58 eigenvectors sets, corresponding to 29 eigenvectors in the + and - directions. The 90% CL PDF uncertainty is computed according to the asymmetric Hessian prescription

\[\delta^{\text{pdf}}\mathcal{F}=\frac{\sqrt{\sum_{k=1}^{N_{\text{elg}}}\left( \mathcal{F}^{(k)}_{(+)}-\mathcal{F}^{(k)}_{(-)}\right)^{2}}}{2}\,. \tag{2}\]

In the final results the 68% CL, obtained by applying a rescale factor to Eq. 2 is used. LO results are estimated using the NLO grid.

MSHT20:Presented in Refs. [24], [25], and [26]. NLO and NNLO grids are provided for the central fit and 65 eigenvector sets. The PDF uncertainty is computed according to Eq. 2. LO results are estimated using the NLO grid.

NNPDF3.1:Presented in Ref. [27]. LO, NLO and NNLO grids are provided for the central fit as well as 100 MC replicas. To evaluate the best value of the predicted cross section \(\mathcal{F}\) and the corresponding PDF uncertainty the ensemble \(\mathcal{S}\) of the \(\mathcal{F}\) values given the 100 replicas of the set is first computed

\[\mathcal{S}=\{\mathcal{F}^{(1)},...,\mathcal{F}^{(100)}\}\,. \tag{3}\]

The elements of Eq. 3 are placed in ascending order and the lowest and the highest 16% of the ordered replicas are removed, keeping in this way the central 68% replicas. Denoting the resulting 68% CL interval as \([\mathcal{F}_{16},\mathcal{F}_{84}]\) the up and down PDF uncertainties are estimated as

\[\delta^{\text{pdf,up}}\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_{84}-\mathcal{F}_{0}\,,\quad \delta^{\text{pdf,down}}\mathcal{F}=\mathcal{F}_{0}-\mathcal{F}_{16}\,, \tag{4}\]

Where \(\mathcal{F}_{0}\) corresponds to the nominal PDF fit. The median of the ensemble \(\mathcal{S}\) in Eq. 3 is quoted as the best value of the predicted cross section.

NNPDF4.0:Presented in Ref. [28], it represents the latest release of the NNPDF family sets and uses the same prescription as _NNPDF31_.

ABMP16:Presented in Ref. [29]. NLO and NNLO grids are provided for the central fit and eigenvectors. The 68% CL interval is obtained using the symmetric Hessian prescription of Eq. 1. For NNLO results the _ABMP16als118_5_nnlo_ set is used, while _ABMP16als118_5_nlo_ is used for LO and NLO results.

The uncertainty on the cross section from each PDF set is estimated by using the appropriate equation from above (Eqs. 1-4). The numerical accuracy is chosen to match that of the central value in order to provide a reliable estimation of the PDF error.

To reduce the computational cost of calculating the PDF uncertainty, the full NNLO QCD prediction is predicted targeting a numerical precision of 0.1% for the central PDF member only. This is then used to compute NNLO QCD correction K-factors, defined as

\[K_{\text{NNLO}}^{\text{QCD}}=\frac{\sum_{ij}\hat{\sigma}_{ij}^{\text{NNLO}} \otimes\mathcal{L}_{ij}^{\text{NNLO}}}{\sum_{ij}\hat{\sigma}_{ij}^{\text{NLO} }\otimes\mathcal{L}_{ij}^{\text{NNLO}}}\,, \tag{5}\]

where \(\hat{\sigma}_{ij}\) denotes the partonic subchannels and \(\mathcal{L}_{ij}\) the corresponding parton luminosities, computed both in the numerator and in the numerator using the same NNLO input PDF set. NNLO results for the remaining PDFs members are obtained by rescaling NLO QCD predictions (obtained using NNLO luminosities and NLO partonic cross sections), computed with a numerical precision \(<0.1\%\), by the NNLO QCD K-factor.

### Electroweak corrections

Electroweak corrections are computed at NLO, and included through a K-factor defined as

\[K^{\text{EW}}=\frac{\sum_{ij}\hat{\sigma}_{ij}^{\text{LOQCD+NLOEW}}\otimes \mathcal{L}_{ij}^{\text{NNLO}}}{\sum_{ij}\hat{\sigma}_{ij}^{\text{LOQCD}} \otimes\mathcal{L}_{ij}^{\text{NNLO}}}\,, \tag{6}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline  & Number of members & Perturbative orders & Error type & Reference \\ \hline PDF4LHC21 & 43 & NNLO & 68\% CL symmHessian & [22] \\ CTEQ18 & 59 & NLO, NNLO & 90\% CL Hessian & [23] \\ MSHT20 & 65 & NLO, NNLO & 68\% CL Hessian & [24, 25, 26] \\ NNPDF3.1 & 101 & LO, NLO, NNLO & Monte Carlo replicas & [27] \\ NNPDF4.0 & 101 & LO, NLO, NNLO & Monte Carlo replicas & [28] \\ ABMP16 & 30 & NNLO, NLO & 68\% CL symmHessian & [29] \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Summary of the PDF sets used in the cross section calculations.

where the partonic cross sections in the numerator and denominator are computed at LO QCD + NLO EW and LO QCD accuracy respectively. Final results for each PDF member are produced by supplementing the NLO QCD predictions with NNLO QCD and NLO EW K-factors according to

\[\sigma^{\rm NNLO_{QCD}+NLO_{EW}}=\sigma^{\rm NLO_{QCD}}\,\times K _{\rm NNLO}^{\rm QCD}\,\times K^{\rm EW}\,, \tag{7}\]

with

\[\sigma^{\rm NLO_{QCD}}=\sum_{ij}\hat{\sigma}_{ij}^{\rm NLO_{QCD}}\otimes{\cal L }_{ij}^{\rm NNLO}\,. \tag{8}\]

### QCD Scale and uncertainties

QCD scale uncertainties are evaluated using seven point variations of the factorization and renormalization scales coherently in the matrix elements and the parton shower [30]. The scales are varied independently by factors of 0.5 and 2 while avoiding cases where the factorization and renormalization scales move in opposite directions.

### Perturbative cut-off treatment

In order to render all terms of the NNLO computations finite, a cut-off \(r_{\rm cut}\) on the dimensionless quantity \(q_{T}/M\) (where \(q_{T}\) is the transverse momentum and \(M\) is the invariant mass of the colourless system) is used, as described in details in Section 2.1 and 2.2 of Ref. [12]. Depending on the process, the result may show a more or less marked dependence on the choice of such a cut-off, and an additional extrapolation procedure is required to obtain the full NNLO result. In this note, the extrapolated result, denoted as \(\sigma^{\rm extr}\), is taken as the best value of the computation. In the case of the process \(pp\to e^{+}e^{-}\), for which the \(r_{\rm cut}\) dependence is reported to be especially strong, the MATRIX runs have been performed using a dedicated option available in the code, which uses smaller values of the cut-off. The details regarding the extrapolation procedure and the \(r_{\rm cut}\) dependence of the different results are described in details in Section 7 of Ref. [12]. The numerical accuracy of the non-extrapolated NNLO computation of the central values is about \(\sim 0.1\%\). When performing the extrapolation procedure the estimated numerical error is increased to about \(\sim 0.3\%\).

## 3 Results

In the following the report results for single boson production up to NNLO QCD + NLO EW are given. Results are presented for each PDF set listed in the previous section, including uncertainties from the PDF set and scale variations. The fiducial cuts which have been used to produce results are shown in Table 3 and are chosen to match the phase space of the most common MC samples used at ATLAS. To ensure the infrared-safe definition of the cross section at NLO EW, collinear charged-lepton-photon pairs within a cone of radius of 0.1 are recombined into dressed leptons from which the fiducial regions are defined. Calculations for a more complete range of MC samples in use at ATLAS are provided in Appendix A, including fiducial cuts on the transverse momentum of the vector boson.

Tables 4 and 5 report the cross sections for the various PDF sets calculated for LO QCD, NLO QCD, NNLO QCD and NNLO QCD + NLO EW corrections at a centre-of-mass energy of \(13.6\,\mathrm{TeV}\). Grids matching the QCD precision in the matrix element calculation are used for each PDF set where available. Notably, for PDF4LHC21 only NNLO grids are available. This results in the cross sections decreasing when the QCD accuracy is increased from NLO to NNLO, while for all other PDF sets the cross sections increase instead. The tables show that the scale uncertainties are larger than the uncertainties coming from the PDF set, and that the former decrease in size with increasing order of the calculation. The predictions between different PDF sets are in agreement although the uncertainties for the NNPDF40 are much smaller than the others, being around half the size. The predictions before and after extrapolation for the treatment of the perturbative cut-off as described in Section 2.5 are found to be very similar. The results for the single boson cross sections are also shown in Figure 1 for the PDF4LHC21 PDF set with various levels of the QCD and EW accuracy in the MATRIX cross section calculation. A comparison of the cross sections obtained with different PDF sets at the highest precision is shown in Figure 2.

### Estimate of \(\alpha_{s}\) uncertainty

In the following an estimate for the \(\alpha_{s}\) uncertainty is provided. The estimate is done using the PDF4LHC21 set which includes the central fits for variations of \(\alpha_{s}\). As detailed in Ref. [22], the PDF4LHC21 combination assumes

\[\alpha_{s}\left(m_{Z}^{2}\right)=0.1180\pm 0.0010\,. \tag{9}\]

Following the prescription given in Ref. [22], for a given cross section \(\sigma\) the \(\alpha_{s}\) uncertainty is estimated as

\[\delta_{\sigma}^{\alpha_{s}}=\frac{\sigma\left(\alpha_{s}=0.119 \right)-\sigma\left(\alpha_{s}=0.117\right)}{2}, \tag{10}\]

corresponding to an uncertainty \(\delta\alpha_{s}=0.0010\) at the 68% CL. In order to compute Eq. 10 Hessian variants which include the central fits for variations of the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}\left(m_{Z}^{2}\right)\) are provided. Results for single boson production calculated to NNLO in the strong coupling constant and to NLO in the electroweak coupling are shown in Table 6. The variations in \(\alpha_{s}\) are observed to be around the same size as the total PDF uncertainty.

### Photon induced contributions

When computing EW corrections, MATRIX allows the separate computation of photon induced contributions. The numbers reported in Tables 4 and 5 do not include such contributions because the inclusive single boson

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline  & \(pp\to e^{+}e^{-}\) & \(pp\to e^{-}\bar{\nu}_{e}\) / \(pp\to e^{+}\nu_{e}\) & \(pp\to\nu_{e}\bar{\nu}_{e}\) \\ \hline
**lepton cuts** & \(m_{ll}>40\,\mathrm{GeV}\) & \(m_{l_{\mathrm{J}}}>2\,\mathrm{GeV}\) & \(m_{\nu\nu}>2\,\mathrm{GeV}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Fiducial cuts for single boson production processes.

Figure 1: Single boson cross sections at a centre-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV calculated for different orders of pQCD and EW corrections with the PDF4LHC21 PDF set: (a) \(pp\to e^{+}e^{-}\), (b) \(pp\to\nu_{e}\bar{\nu}_{e}\), (c) \(pp\to e^{-}\bar{\nu}_{e}\), and (d) \(pp\to e^{+}\nu_{e}\).

MC samples used by ATLAS also do not include them. However, for separately produced MC samples containing these contributions it is important to understand the size of the effect. In the following the impact of the photon induced channels, using as input PDF the set _NNPDF31luxqed_[31], which contains PDFs for the photon is studied. Results calculated to NNLO QCD + NLO EW with and without photon induced contributions are reported in Table 7. The quoted errors correspond to the scale uncertainty, while the best value of the predicted cross section has been produced using the central value of the _NNPDF31luxqed_ PDF. The variations due to photon induced contributions increase with the number of charged leptons and for the \(pp\to e^{+}e^{-}\) process are around the same size as the total PDF uncertainty.

### Cross sections for different centre-of-mass energies

In the following values for cross sections estimates at different centre-of-mass energies are provided. The fiducial cuts which have been used to compute these numbers are the same as used for the 13.6 TeV values. The results are shown in Table 8. The quoted error corresponds to the scale uncertainty, while the best value of the predicted cross section has been produced using the central value of the PDF4LHC21 PDF.

The first error corresponds to the scale uncertainty, while the second to the uncertainties associated with the PDF set, estimated as described in Section 2.2.

The results calculated using DYTurbo and ReneSANCe are shown in Table 9. The \(pp\to\nu_{e}\bar{\nu}_{e}\) process is excluded because it is not available in DYTurbo.

The NLO EW corrections include NLO contributions from initial-state photon radiation, EW loop corrections, and initial-state-final-state photon interference. The NLO EW corrections applied to the NNLO QCD fiducial cross sections are about \(-0.4\%\) for the \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) channels and \(-0.3\%\) for the neutral-current channel, respectively. Additional two-loop EW corrections for the leading contributions are calculated, and it is found to be \(<0.1\%\). These higher-order EW corrections have only a mild dependence on the centre-of-mass energy, and they are in agreement with earlier results from calculations benchmarked in the LHC EW working group [32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. The cross sections as a function of the centre-of-mass energy are shown in Figure 3.

The inclusive \(W\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) cross sections and uncertainties using the latest MC programs utilised in ATLAS are provided for a centre-of-mass energy of \(13\,\mathrm{TeV}\) in Table 2 of the publication [11]. These multi-jet merged configurations are accurate to next-to-leading order in the strong and electroweak couplings. The uncertainties due to the scale choice are found to be considerably larger (typically by a factor 4 or more) than the higher order corrections shown in this note and, therefore, justify the use of the latter to normalise the cross sections of the MC simulation samples.

## 4 Conclusions

The production of a single vector boson is an important process for study at the LHC and an integral part of the ATLAS physics programme. State-of-the-art predictions for single boson production are routinely used in comparisons with data measurements, and for the modelling the normalisation of backgrounds in measurements of other SM processes or searches for physics beyond the SM.

This note provides cross sections for the inclusive production of \(W\) and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) bosons at the LHC computed up to NNLO in the strong coupling constant and NLO in the electroweak coupling. The cross sections and uncertainties are computed for a number of different PDF sets focusing on the centre-of-mass energy of \(13.6\,\mathrm{TeV}\) corresponding to the ongoing Run 3 of the LHC. The central values of the cross sections are also given for other centre-of-mass energies, namely \(5.02\), \(7\), \(8\), \(13\) and \(14\,\mathrm{TeV}\). Theoretical uncertainties are evaluated for those coming from the choice of perturbative scale and for the uncertainties from the PDF set used, and the former is found be the largest source of uncertainty. Additional calculations are performed including varying the value of \(\alpha_{s}\) and studying the effects of photon induced contributions. These sources of uncertainty are found to be of similar size to those coming from the PDF set. The MATRIX calculations are validated by comparing with results from DYTurbo and ReneSANCe and the results are found to be in agreement at the per-mille level.
