###### Abstract

The aim of our work was to investigate the production of top-antitop pairs and the spin correlations when the top (antitop) quark decays to a b-quark and two leptons (only one lepton is detectable, the neutrino is invisible). Several observables describing spin correlations and the corresponding estimators were studied. The effect of spin correlations was studied in the case of proton-proton collisions at the energy of 14 TeV for the ATLAS detector. A full density matrix was used at the generation level. We can conclude that spin correlations could be observed in the ATLAS experiment.

## Introduction

The Standard Model (SM) is a successful theory of elementary particles even though several free parameters (e.g., masses of quarks and leptons, decay properties, etc.) need to be determined experimentally. The top quark is exceptional having a high mass and a short life-time of \(10^{-24}s\). During this short time the top quark can not hadronise and decays instead as a free quark. Therefore, the decay products maintain the properties of the quark and provide information about its production and decay mechanisms. In the period between 1992 and 1996 the Tevatron accelerator in Fermilab collided protons and antiprotons which were accelerated up to a centre-of-mass energy of \(1.8\,\mathrm{TeV}\) (Run I). The discovery in 1995 of the top quark was the product of

describe the spin state of the \(t\), \(\overline{t}\) quarks. The matrix structure of \(R^{(\lambda)}\) (see [5]) is:

\[R^{(\lambda)}=A^{(\lambda)}\delta_{\alpha\alpha^{\shortmid}}\delta_{\beta\beta^ {\shortmid}}+B_{i}^{(\lambda)}(\sigma^{i})_{\alpha\alpha^{\shortmid}}\,\delta_{ \beta\beta^{\shortmid}}+\vec{B}_{i}^{(\lambda)}\,\delta_{\alpha\alpha^{ \shortmid}}(\sigma^{i})\delta_{\beta\beta^{\shortmid}}+C_{ij}(\sigma^{i})_{ \alpha\alpha^{\shortmid}}(\sigma^{j})_{\beta\beta^{\shortmid}}\,, \tag{2}\]

where \(\sigma^{i}\) are the Pauli matrices. Assuming P, CP and rotational invariance, we get:

\[B^{(\lambda)} = \vec{B}^{(\lambda)}=b^{(\lambda)}\frac{{\bf p}_{1}\times{\bf k}_ {1}}{\left|{\bf p}\times{\bf k}\right|}, \tag{3}\]

and

\[C_{ij}^{(\lambda)} = c_{0}^{(\lambda)}\delta_{i\,j}+c_{4}^{(\lambda)}\,\hat{p}_{i} \,\hat{p}_{j}+c_{5}^{(\lambda)}\,\hat{k}_{i}\,\hat{k}_{j}+c_{6}^{(\lambda)}\,( \hat{p}\,\hat{k}_{j}+\hat{k}_{i}\,\hat{p}_{j}), \tag{4}\]

with \(p=p_{1}\), \(k=k_{1}\). The \(A^{(\lambda)}\), \(b^{(\lambda)}\) and \(c_{k}^{(\lambda)}\) coefficients depend only on the partonic energy and on the c.m. angle of the \(t\) quark and of course on the spin basis of the \(t\) and \(\overline{t}\) quarks. The \(b^{(\lambda)}\) coefficient describes transverse polarization of the \(t\overline{t}\) pairs. From [6] it follows that a measurement of this effect at the LHC will be difficult. Therefore the corresponding part of the density matrix \(R^{(\lambda)}\) can be neglected. We have computed the density matrix (1) and our result is in agreement with the result obtained in [5], [6].

We define the density matrix for the decay \(t\to b\ \overline{l}\ \nu_{\overline{t}}\) of a polarized \(t\) quark as:

\[\rho_{\alpha\alpha^{\shortmid}}=<t_{\alpha}\ \left|{\cal T}_{t}\right|\,b\ \overline{l}\ \nu_{\overline{t}}><b\ \overline{l}\ \nu_{\overline{t}}\left|{\cal T}_{t}^{\dagger} \right|t_{\alpha^{\shortmid}}>. \tag{5}\]A similar \(\vec{\rho}\) matrix is defined for the decay of the \(\vec{t}\) quark. The squared matrix element for the process \(\lambda+\vec{\lambda}\to t+\vec{t}\to b\ \vec{l}\ \nu_{l}+\vec{b}\ l\ \vec{\nu}_{l}\) is then proportional to:

\[{\rm Tr}\left[\rho R^{(\lambda)}\vec{\rho}\right]=\rho_{\alpha^{i}\alpha}R^{( \lambda)}_{\alpha\alpha^{i},\beta\beta^{i}}\vec{\rho}_{\beta^{i}\beta}. \tag{6}\]

## Top-antitop spin correlations

For the expression of the density matrix \(R^{(\lambda)}\) we can choose the helicity spin basis for the \(t\), \(\vec{t}\) quarks. It has been shown [7] that for LHC the off-diagonal elements of the density matrix \(R^{(\lambda)}\) in this spin basis are small and the \(t\), \(\vec{t}\) quarks can be considered as a sharp spin state. The corresponding squared matrix element for the production of \(t\vec{t}\) pairs is expressed in [8].

It is straightforward to rewrite the squared matrix element for the complete decay chain of the \(t\) quark in the sharp spin state [8] to the rest frame of \(t\) quark as

\[\left|{\cal M}\left(t\left(\vec{s}_{t}\right)\to b\ \vec{l}\ \nu_{l}\right) \right|^{2}=g_{w}^{4}\frac{\left(2\nu\cdot b\right)\left(E_{\vec{t}}+\vec{ \overline{l}}\cdot\vec{s}_{t}\right)}{\left(2\nu\cdot\vec{l}-M_{W}^{2}\right)^ {2}+M_{W}^{2}\Gamma_{W}^{2}}, \tag{7}\]

where \(b\), \(\nu\) and \(\overline{l}\) are the corresponding momenta in the top rest frame and \(\vec{s}_{t}\) is a unit vector in the direction of \(t\) quark spin. For massless \(\overline{l}\), the corresponding differential decay rate is proportional to

\[\frac{{\rm d}\,\Gamma\left(t\left(\vec{s}_{t}\right)\to b\ \overline{l}\ \nu_{l}\right)}{{\rm d}\Phi}\propto 1 +\hat{\vec{v}}_{\overline{l}}\cdot\vec{s}_{t}\,, \tag{8}\]

where \({\rm d}\Phi\) is an element of phase space and \(\hat{\vec{v}}_{\overline{l}}\) is the unit vector in the direction of momentum \(\overline{l}\) in the \(t\) quark rest frame. The multiplicative constant depends only on the phase space parametrisation, the momenta \(b\), \(\nu\) and \(\overline{l}\) and does not depend on the direction of the spin \(\vec{s}_{t}\). Similarly for the \(\overline{t}\) quark we get

\[\frac{{\rm d}\,\Gamma\left(\vec{t}\left(\vec{s}_{\overline{t}}\right)\to \overline{b}\ l\ \vec{\nu}_{l}\right)}{{\rm d}\,\Phi}\propto 1-\hat{\vec{v}}_{l}\cdot \vec{s}_{\overline{t}}. \tag{9}\]

The 6-particle decay rate for the process \(t\left(\vec{s}_{t}\right)+\vec{t}\left(\vec{s}_{\overline{t}}\right)\to b\ \overline{l}\ \nu_{l}+\overline{b}\ l\ \vec{\nu}_{l}\) is then proportional to

\[\frac{{\rm d}\,\Gamma^{2}\left(t\left(\vec{s}_{t}\right)+\vec{t} \left(\vec{s}_{\overline{t}}\right)\to b\ \overline{l}\ \nu_{l}+\overline{b}\ l\ \vec{\nu}_{l}\right)}{{\rm d}\,\Phi\,{\rm d}\,\Phi} \propto 1+{\cal A}\ (\hat{\vec{v}}_{\overline{l}}\cdot\vec{s}_{t})(\hat{\vec{v}}_{l} \cdot\vec{s}_{\overline{t}})\equiv \tag{10}\] \[\equiv 1+{\cal A}\,{\rm cos}\ \Theta_{\overline{l}}{\rm cos}\ \Theta_{l}\,,\]where

\[{\cal A}=(1-2P_{lik\,e}) \tag{11}\]

and \(P_{like}\) is the fraction of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs produced with like-spin orientation. It is seen, that for the isotropic decay of \(t\overline{t}\), \({\cal A}=0\). Thus, a nonzero \({\cal A}\) coefficient is a signature of the spin correlation of the \(t\overline{t}\) pairs.

The differential decay rate of polarized \(t\) quark in the rest frame of the decaying particle may also be parameterized as

\[\frac{1}{\Gamma}\frac{{\rm d}\Gamma}{{\rm d}(\cos\,\Theta_{i})}=\frac{1+\alpha _{i}\cos\,\Theta_{i}}{2}, \tag{12}\]

and, similarly, for the \(\overline{t}\) quark

\[\frac{1}{\Gamma}\frac{{\rm d}\Gamma}{{\rm d}(\cos\,\Theta_{\overline{i}})}= \frac{1-\alpha_{\overline{i}}\cos\,\Theta_{\overline{i}}}{2}. \tag{13}\]

The angle between the chosen spin axis and the direction of motion of the decay products (\(i=b\), \(\overline{l}\), \(\nu_{l}\)) in the rest frame of the \(t\) (\(\overline{t}\)) quark is \(\Theta_{i}\) (\(\Theta_{\overline{i}}\)). For \(\overline{l}\) (\(l\)) the value \(\alpha\) is 1, for \(b\) (\(\overline{b}\)) quark is \(-0.41\) and for \(\nu_{l}\) (\(\overline{\nu}_{l}\)) is -0.31 [8]. The double differential decay rate for the two decay products of the \(t\overline{t}\) pair is then

\[\frac{1}{\Gamma}\frac{{\rm d}^{2}\Gamma}{{\rm d}(\cos\,\Theta_{i}){\rm d}( \cos\,\Theta_{\overline{i}})}=\frac{1+\kappa\cos\,\Theta_{i}\cos\,\Theta_{ \overline{i}}}{4}, \tag{14}\]

where

\[\kappa=(1-2P_{lik\,e})\alpha_{i}\,\alpha_{\overline{i}}={\cal A}\alpha_{i} \alpha_{\overline{i}}\,. \tag{15}\]

## Measurement of spin correlations

In this section we investigate how to measure the value of the coefficient \({\cal A}\) from the experimental data. After using the probability density (14) for decay products \(\overline{l}\) and \(l\) we see

\[P(x_{1},x_{2})=\frac{1+{\cal A}\cos\,\Theta_{\overline{l}}{\rm cos}\,\Theta_ {l}}{4}, \tag{16}\]

\[x_{1}=\cos\,\Theta_{\overline{l}},\qquad x_{2}=\cos\,\Theta_{l}\,. \tag{17}\]

It can be shown that

\[{\cal A}={\rm E}(9x_{1}x_{2})\equiv\int\limits_{-1}^{1}{\rm d}x_{1}\,\int \limits_{-1}^{1}{\rm d}x_{2}\,\,9x_{1}x_{2}\,P(x_{1},x_{2}), \tag{18}\]where \({\rm E}(x)\) is the mean value of the \(x\) variable. For example another expression of \({\cal A}\) was introduced [9]

\[{\cal A} = 4\,\left(\int\limits_{0}^{1}P(\xi){\rm d}\xi-\int\limits_{-1}^{0}P (\xi){\rm d}\xi\right) \tag{19}\] \[= {\rm E}\Big{(}4\big{[}2\Theta(\xi)-1\big{]}\Big{)}, \tag{20}\]

with

\[\xi=x_{1}x_{2}. \tag{21}\]

\(\Theta(x)\) is the usual \(\Theta\) function (+1 for positive \(x\), 0 otherwise) and the probability distribution for \(\xi=x_{1}x_{2}\) can be expressed as

\[P(\xi)=-\frac{1}{2}\ln\big{|}\xi\big{|}(1+{\cal A}\xi). \tag{22}\]

This function is illustrated in Fig. 2.

Let us suppose we have \(n\) measured events and \(n\) corresponding pairs \(x_{1}^{(i)}\), \(x_{2}^{(i)}\), \(i=1,\cdots,n\). To measure the \({\cal A}\) coefficient we can use the estimator

\[\hat{\cal A}_{1}=9\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{1}^{(i)}x_{2}^{(i)}\equiv 9<x_{ 1}x_{2}>. \tag{23}\]It can be proven that the mean value of \(\hat{\cal A}_{1}\) is

\[{\rm E}(\hat{\cal A}_{1})={\cal A}, \tag{24}\]

and its variance is

\[\sigma^{2}(\hat{\cal A}_{1})=\frac{9-{\cal A}^{2}}{n}. \tag{25}\]

Similarly, for the estimator \({\cal A}_{2}\)

\[\hat{\cal A}_{2} = 4\left(2\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\Theta(x_{1}^{(i)}x_{2}^{(i)}) -1\right) \tag{26}\] \[\equiv 4\left(2<\Theta(x_{1}x_{2})>-1\right) \tag{27}\]

the mean value and the variance are

\[{\rm E}(\hat{\cal A}_{2}) = {\cal A}, \tag{28}\] \[\sigma^{2}(\hat{\cal A}_{2}) = \frac{16-{\cal A}^{2}}{n}. \tag{29}\]

The estimator \(\hat{\cal A}_{2}\) is equal to the difference between the fraction of events with positive and negative products \(x_{1}^{(i)}x_{2}^{(i)}\).

From (25) and (29) it follows that \(\hat{\cal A}_{1}\) is a better estimator of \({\cal A}\) than \(\hat{\cal A}_{2}\). The best possibility to compute \({\cal A}\) is by using a maximum likelihood method. It is based on a computation of \({\cal A}\) which maximizes the joint probability for all the data

\[{\cal L}({\cal A})=\prod_{i=1}^{n}P(x_{1}^{(i)},x_{2}^{(i)},{\cal A}). \tag{30}\]

An equivalent approach is to solve the equation

\[\frac{{\rm d}{\cal L}({\cal A})}{{\rm d}{\cal A}}=0, \tag{31}\]

or alternatively solving the expression

\[\frac{{\rm d}\ln{\cal L}({\cal A})}{{\rm d}{\cal A}}=0. \tag{32}\]

Using (16) we get the expression

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{x_{1}^{(i)}x_{2}^{(i)}}{1+{\cal A}\,x_{1}^{(i)}x_{2}^{(i) }}=0. \tag{33}\]So far we have used kinematic information about only two decay products: \(\overline{l}\) and \(l\). But using a maximum likelihood method for the 6-particle decay rate (10) from the formula (32) we get the same equation (33) as when using only \(\overline{l}\), \(l\). Thus most information for the computation of \(\mathcal{A}\) is contained only in two decay products (\(\overline{l}\), \(l\)).

Fig. 3 compares the \(\sigma^{2}\) variance obtained by computing \(\mathcal{A}\) using the estimators \(\hat{\mathcal{A}}_{1}\), \(\hat{\mathcal{A}}_{2}\) and the maximum likelihood method. Results are computed for \(\mathcal{A}=-0.34\). It is obvious that for a sufficiently high number of events the use of the estimator \(\hat{\mathcal{A}}_{1}\) is equivalent to the method of maximum likelihood.

## Monte-Carlo simulation

We developed a Monte-Carlo generator [10] based on PYTHIA 6.156 [11], but which includes the spin properties of top-antitop pair production. The library ATLFAST 2.22 [12] was used to simulate the ATLAS detector. The code was optimized for use with the Root 3 [13] framework for data analysis. For PYTHIA fragmentation, the parameters PARJ[55]=-0.0035 and MSTJ[11]=3 were used.

A complete density matrix was implemented for the production and the ensuing decay of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs to gain better accuracy and independence from the spin basis used. For the sake of comparison, an additional simulation was made with only diagonal elements for the density matrix in the helicity basis.

The most important background process is the production of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs where at least one top quark decays to a \(b\)-quark, a \(\tau\) lepton and a \(\tau\)-neutrino. The \(\tau\) lepton can decay to an electron or a muon and two neutrinos. The detected final state particles are the same as in the investigated process but the kinematic topology is different. Such events may affect the kinematic reconstruction of the event topology and (using the present reconstruction algorithm) the observed spin correlations become strongly altered. Events with a \(\tau\) lepton are significantly different from signal events, mainly in the distribution of the transverse momentum of the observed charged leptons (Fig. 4). Therefore we set a cut on the charged leptons \(p_{T}>25\) GeV. At the parton level the ratio between signal and the \(\tau\) background is \(S/B=1/0.382\). After applying all kinematic cuts, simulating the detector response and reconstructing the event topology, this ratio is significantly improved: \(S/B=1/0.117\).

The following event selection criteria were used [15]: events with two detected leptons (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) of opposite charge, pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\), trans

(full line). In Fig. 8 the \(\mathcal{A}\) coefficients computed on the parton level versus \(\mathcal{A}\) computed from the events after ATLFAST+cuts+reconstruction are shown. The points correspond to the energy intervals used in Fig. 7.

Results of computation of \(\mathcal{A}\) for different conditions of the MC generator are summarized in Table 1. The first column shows results obtained from simulations processed at the parton level while in the second column there are results with the kinematic cuts, detector response and event topology reconstruction. The third column shows the corresponding number of generated events.

The first row shows the result obtained using standard PYTHIA without background events. It can be seen that at the parton level, the \(\mathcal{A}\) coefficient

is equal to zero within statistical errors. Nevertheless, the nonzero result in the second column is caused by the kinematic cuts and limitations in the reconstruction of topology of events.

The second row contains results obtained using our modified version of PYTHIA where spin information about top quarks is included and without background events. The full density matrix for the production and decay of top quarks has been used. In this case the \(\mathcal{A}\) coefficient is obviously nonzero.

We also investigated the influence of initial and final state radiation on the \(\mathcal{A}\) coefficient. The next three rows show the results obtained for the previous simulations processed without initial and final state radiation, with only final and only initial state radiation. At the parton level there are no

apparent differences. The values in the second column are not significantly different.

For all the simulations the GRV 94L structure functions were used. As shown in Table 1, we also used the CTEQ 3L structure function with similar results within \(2\sigma\).

The significant influence of the diagonal elements of the density matrix can be seen by comparing row 2 and row 7 of Table 1. The result in row 2 was obtained using the full density matrix while the result in row 7 was obtained only from diagonal elements of the density matrix (in the helicity spin basis).

To investigate the influence of the error on the \(b\)-jet energy calibration, the energy of detected \(b\)-jets was shifted (\(E_{b}+10\%\), \(E_{b}-10\%\)). The effects

of this shift on the \({\cal A}\) value are shown in rows 8 and 9.

Row 10 shows the results for only background events (top or antitop quark decays to tau lepton). It can be seen that, due to the reconstruction algorithm, the \({\cal A}\) values are strongly shifted upwards. Using kinematic cuts (row 11) the influence of such background is significantly reduced.

The final results are presented in the last two rows: results obtained with standard PYTHIA without spin properties of \(t\overline{t}\) including background and results obtained with modified PYTHIA including background. About \(2\cdot 10^{6}\) signal events have been generated. After using ATLAS simulation, reconstruction and cuts about \(870\cdot 10^{3}\) events remained.

## Conclusions

In Table 2 we summarize the results for our study of \(t\overline{t}\) spin correlations calculated under the assumption of low luminosity LHC runs \({\cal L}=10\,{\rm fb}^{-1}\)/year and a \(t\overline{t}\) production cross section \(\sigma=833\,{\rm pb}\)[15]. The spin-spin correlations of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs could be measured with a statistical significance 10 standard deviations with integrated luminosity 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). This would enable the study of the dynamics of heavy quark production and decay even beyond the Standard Model.
