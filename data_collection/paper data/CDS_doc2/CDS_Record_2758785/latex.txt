Combined effective field theory interpretation of \(H\to WW^{*}\) and \(Ww\) measurements using ATLAS data

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Effective field theory parameters are constrained in a combination of a measurement of \(H\to WW^{*}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) in the gluon-fusion and vector-boson fusion production modes with differential cross-section measurements of \(WW\) diboson production in the \(e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) decay channel, with a veto on additional jets. The combination uses the likelihood function obtained in the measurement of the signal strengths of each Higgs boson production mode together with the unfolded differential cross-sections extracted for the \(WW\) process. Uncertainties of the two measurements are evaluated coherently and correlated appropriately. The signal regions of the two measurements are orthogonal and overlaps in control regions are removed. This note highlights how such combinations can be carried out technically and is a stepping stone for more global effective field theory combinations. Both measurements are based on 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV. The combination considers the effect of 20 CP-even Wilson coefficients and is able to constrain eight degrees of freedom simultaneously.

## 1 Introduction

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT, see for example Ref. [1] for an overview) allows to describe the effects of a variety of theories beyond the standard model that introduce new-physics states at a mass scale \(\Lambda\) that is large in comparison to the electroweak scale. The theory provides predictions for experimental observables in terms of an expansion in \(E/\Lambda\), where \(E\) is the typical energy exchanged in the process. This is done by using a series of operators \(\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(d)}\), which consist of gauge invariant combinations of SM fields with an energy dimension \(d\) greater than four:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{SMEFT}}=\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}+\sum_{i}\frac{c_{i}^{(5)}}{ \Lambda}\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(5)}+\sum_{i}\frac{c_{i}^{(6)}}{\Lambda^{2}}\mathcal{ O}_{i}^{(6)}+\ldots. \tag{1}\]

Measurements of observables allow to constrain the coefficients \(c_{i}^{(d)}\) associated to each SMEFT operator.

In this note a SMEFT interpretation of combined measurements is presented to constrain dimension-six operators. The operators are expressed using the Warsaw basis [2], which provides a complete set of orthogonal operators allowed by the gauge symmetries. The combination uses a measurement of the production of an on-shell Higgs boson (\(H\)) with subsequent decay into a pair of \(W\) bosons (\(H\to WW^{*}\)) [3] and a measurement of the production of two on-shell \(W\) bosons (\(WW\)) [4]. Both measurements are sensitive to a large number of dimension-six SMEFT operators and a large fraction of those affect both measurements. The combination of the two measurements requires to overcome several challenges: event selections of the measurements partially overlap and \(W\) boson pair production is background to \(H\to WW^{*}\), systematic uncertainties are correlated between the two measurements, and different analysis techniques are employed. Similar challenges are anticipated for future effective field theory (EFT) combinations of ATLAS measurements, making this combination an instructional test case towards future combinations of EFT-sensitive measurements at the LHC.

## 2 Data and input measurements

Both the \(H\to WW^{*}\)[3] and the \(WW\) measurement [4] are based on 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=\)13 TeV by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC during the years 2015 and 2016.

The \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurement targets Higgs boson production via gluon fusion (ggF) and vector-boson fusion (VBF) and Higgs boson decays through \(H\to WW^{*}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\). It is performed in three signal regions, with zero, one, and two jets. Signal candidates are selected by requiring the presence of an isolated \(e^{\pm}\mu^{\mp}\) pair, with transverse momentum thresholds of 22 and 15 GeV for the higher-\(p_{\text{T}}\) (leading) and lower-\(p_{\text{T}}\) (subleading) lepton. Events with jets tagged as containing \(b\)-hadrons are rejected to suppress background contributions originating from top-quark production. The results are extracted in a maximum likelihood fit of two signal-strength parameters that correspond to the overall normalization of the ggF and VBF \(H\to WW^{*}\) production processes relative to that of the SM. For this EFT interpretation, the signal strength modifiers are reparametrized in terms of Wilson coefficients, the parameters of the effective field theory model.

The \(WW\) measurement accepts all production modes and \(e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) final states. The event selection suppresses \(H\to WW^{*}\) production by requiring the invariant mass of the two charged leptons, \(m_{e\mu}\), to be greater than 55 GeV so that the production of two on-shell \(W\) bosons dominates. A veto on jets with\(p_{\rm T}>35\) GeV and \(|\eta|<4.5\) is employed in the signal region, to suppress backgrounds from top quark production. After subtracting backgrounds, the data is unfolded and fiducial cross sections are reported for a particle-level phase space that is similar to the reconstruction level event selection. The unfolded differential cross section as a function of the highest lepton transverse momentum, \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm lead.\ lep.}\), is analyzed for the EFT interpretation, as it is very sensitive to effects of dimension-six operators that increase with the parton centre-of-mass energy. The differential cross section is measured in 14 bins. The lowest threshold is 27 GeV and the last bin includes all events with \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm lead.\ lep.}\) of 300 GeV or higher. For the EFT interpretation, the predicted cross section in each bin is parameterized in terms of Wilson coefficients.

The signal regions of the two measurements employ orthogonal event selections: \(m_{e\mu}>55\) GeV is required in the \(WW\) and \(m_{e\mu}<55\) GeV in the \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurement. However, the latter measurement uses events with \(m_{e\mu}>55\) to estimate the background from on-shell \(WW\) production, split into two control regions for events with no reconstructed hadronic jets and with exactly one jet. The WW measurement overlaps with the 0-jet control region and, despite the jet-veto requirement, with the 1-jet control region since the \(H\to WW^{*}\) and \(WW\) measurements use different jet object definitions of \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>30\) GeV (\(H\to WW^{*}\)) and \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>35\) GeV (\(WW\)) respectively. For the combination, these control regions of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis are removed and the signal region of the \(WW\) measurement is used instead to constrain the \(WW\) background yield in the \(H\to WW^{*}\) signal region. Uncertainties on this extrapolation are implicitly taken into account by the statistical model introduced in Section 4.

## 3 Theoretical predictions

### Linearized SMEFT model

The general formulation introduced in Eq. 1 can be simplified by ignoring odd-dimensional operators, which introduce lepton and baryon number violation, and by restricting the expansion to its leading terms, yielding

\[\mathcal{L}_{\rm SMEFT}\approx\mathcal{L}_{\rm SM}^{(4)}+\sum_{i}\frac{c_{i}^{ (6)}}{\Lambda^{2}}\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(6)}+\sum_{j}\frac{c_{j}^{(8)}}{\Lambda^{4} }\mathcal{O}_{j}^{(8)}. \tag{2}\]

Here \(\mathcal{L}_{SM}^{(4)}\) is the usual renormalizable part of the SM Lagrangian, which contains dimension-two and dimension-four operators only. In the remaining terms, \(\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(d)}\) denote the dimension-\(d\) operators, and \(c_{i}^{(d)}\) stand for the corresponding dimensionless coupling constants referred to as Wilson coefficients. Throughout this note, \(\Lambda=1\) TeV is assumed. Results for alternative values of the new-physics scale, \(\Lambda^{\prime}\), can be obtained by multiplying the dimension-six Wilson coefficients by \((\Lambda^{\prime}/\Lambda)^{2}\). Wilson coefficients are expected to be \(c_{i}^{(d)}\lesssim 1\) within the range of validity of the EFT [1].

Scattering cross sections can then be expressed as

\[\sigma=|\mathcal{M}_{\rm SMEFT}|^{2}=|\mathcal{M}_{\rm SM}+\sum_{i}\frac{c_{i }^{(6)}}{\Lambda^{2}}\mathcal{M}_{i}^{(6)}|^{2}+O\left(\Lambda^{-4}\right)=| \mathcal{M}_{\rm SM}|^{2}+\sum_{i}\frac{c_{i}^{(6)}}{\Lambda^{2}}2\text{Re} \left(\mathcal{M}_{i}^{(6)}\mathcal{M}_{\rm SM}^{*}\right)+O\left(\Lambda^{-4} \right), \tag{3}\]

where \(\mathcal{M}_{\rm SM}\) is the matrix element as it occurs in the SM and \(\mathcal{M}_{i}^{(6)}\) are amplitudes containing the operator \(\mathcal{O}_{i}^{(6)}\). The leading contribution is thus given by the interference of dimension-six new-physics effects with the SM. Both the leading contributions from \(O_{j}^{(8)}\) operators and dimension-six squared amplitudes only enter the expansion at \(O(\frac{1}{\Lambda^{4}})\) and are neglected in this analysis, since no model is yet available that can give a full description of \(\frac{1}{\Lambda^{4}}\) effects.

In this approximation, cross sections of a given process \(p\) (either Higgs boson production through ggF or VBF or \(pp\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) production) can be expanded as

\[\sigma^{P}=\sigma^{P}_{\rm SM}\left(1+\sum_{i}A_{i}^{p}c_{i}\right), \tag{4}\]

where \(\sigma^{P}_{\rm SM}\) is the SM cross section and \(A_{i}\) is the linear effect of the operator associated with the Wilson coefficient \(c_{i}\) on the cross section, relative to the SM cross section. The superscript is dropped for dimension-six operators and their Wilson coefficients.

The resonant Higgs boson process is simulated using the narrow width approximation, which allows to factorize the cross section into the product of a production cross section and a branching ratio into the final state of interest. For the calculation of Higgs boson branching ratios \(\mathcal{B}\), a SMEFT correction to both the total Higgs boson width \(\Gamma^{\rm tot}\) and the partial width into \(ev\mu\nu\), \(\Gamma^{H\to e\nu\mu\nu}\), are required:

\[\mathcal{B}^{H\to e\mu\nu\nu}=\frac{\Gamma^{H\to e\nu\mu\nu}}{\Gamma^{\rm tot }}=\mathcal{B}^{H\to e\mu\nu\nu}_{\rm SM}\left(\frac{1+\sum_{i}c_{i}B_{i}^{H \to e\nu\mu\nu}}{1+\sum_{i}c_{i}B_{i}^{\rm tot}}\right)+O\left(\Lambda^{-4} \right), \tag{5}\]

where \(B_{i}^{H\to e\nu\mu\nu}\) are the linear corrections to the partial width of the \(e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) final state and \(B_{i}^{\rm tot}\) the corrections to the total Higgs boson width. The linearized expression for the product of production and decay is given by:

\[\sigma^{P}\mathcal{B}^{H\to e\mu\nu\nu}=\sigma^{P}_{\rm SM}\mathcal{B}^{H \to e\mu\nu\nu}_{\rm SM}\left(1+\sum_{i}A_{i}^{p}c_{i}+\sum_{i}c_{i}B_{i}^{H \to e\nu\mu\nu}-\sum_{i}c_{i}B_{i}^{\rm tot}\right)+O\left(\Lambda^{-4} \right). \tag{6}\]

The truncation of the EFT expansion after \(O(\Lambda^{-2})\) results in a theory uncertainty due to missing higher order terms. The uncertainty can be estimated by studying dimension-six squared amplitudes, which are part of the \(O(\Lambda^{-4})\) contributions. For some operators, these are large for Wilson coefficient values that correspond to the typical size of the limits obtained from the fit of the linear EFT model. This is a consequence of the limited sensitivity to the effect of these operators: for large enough values of Wilson coefficients, terms quadratic in the \(c_{i}\) dominate over linear terms. Especially problematic is the \(O_{W}\) triple-gauge-coupling operator, for which the quadratic term is orders of magnitude larger than the linear term, due to a suppression of the interference of SM and dimension-six amplitudes [5; 6]. Since this publication focuses on the experimental challenges of combined EFT interpretations, the estimation of theory uncertainties due to the truncation of the EFT expansion is omitted.

### Simulation of the effect of dimension-six operators

The effect of dimension-six operators on the signal production processes, \(WW\) production as well as ggF and VBF Higgs boson production, is studied at the order lowest order of perturbation theory for which the process occurs in the SM. A \(U(3)^{5}\) flavour symmetry, which requires operators to be symmetric in the three fermion generations, is assumed and the \(m_{W},m_{Z}\), \(G_{\rm F}\) input parameter scheme is used. In total 24 CP-evenoperators affect the signal processes of the two measurements. The operators and their corresponding Wilson coefficient are summarized in Table 1. In the linear approximation, CP-odd operators do not affect the measured observables.

Dedicated samples representing linear SMEFT effects, due to the interference of each dimension-six operator with the SM, are generated using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[7]. The effect of dimension-six operators that contribute to \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) production is simulated at leading order QCD using the SMEFTsim [8] model and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 2.8.1[7], interfaced to Pythia 8.244[9], with the A14 tune [10] for parton showering and hadronization. Events with zero and one jet are simulated in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and the overlap between matrix element and parton shower emissions is removed using the CKKW-L merging procedure [11, 12]. In the signal region of the \(WW\) analysis the effect of operators is parametrized differentially in analysis bins. For the \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) background to

VBF Higgs boson production is also simulated at leading order, using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 2.6.2 and the SMEFTsim model. SMEFT effects in ggF \(H\to WW^{*}\) production are simulated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 2.7.3 and SMEFTatNLO [13], since the leading contribution to the process is at loop level. The ggF process is generated with zero, one, and two additional partons in the final state, using the MLM algorithm for merging [14; 15] is used to eliminate overlap between the matrix elements. VBF and ggF Higgs boson production events are interfaced to Pythia 8.230 for parton showering and hadronization. The dependence of the total width of the Higgs boson on Wilson coefficients is computed by simulating Higgs boson decays to other final states. They are simulated with SMEFTsim, except for the decay into gluons, which is simulated with SMEFTatNLO. An analytically derived parameterization including next-to-leading order electroweak corrections [16] is used for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) contribution to the total Higgs boson width.

In the phase space of the \(WW\) analysis, the loop-induced \(gg\to\mu^{\pm}e^{\mp}\nu\nu\) process is simulated with SMEFTatNLO for all operators that affect ggF production and Higgs boson decays into \(e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\). While the addition of this process constitutes only a small correction to \(WW\) production, the consistent treatment of on-shell and off-shell Higgs boson production is important for the correct modelling of the degeneracies of operators that are involved in ggF production. Operators that do not affect Higgs boson production are not taken into account for \(gg\to\mu^{\pm}e^{\mp}\nu\nu\), as the process only constitutes a higher-order QCD correction to \(WW\) production. Events are generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 2.7.3, interfaced to Pythia 8.230, with the A14 tune for parton showering and hadronization. In the signal region of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis, ggF Higgs boson production is simulated separately from the \(gg\to\mu^{\pm}e^{\mp}\nu\nu\) background and the interference of the two processes is negligible. Since \(gg\to\mu^{\pm}e^{\mp}\nu\nu\) can be treated as a higher-order correction to \(WW\) production and is responsible for only 10% of the total WW background, SMEFT effects on the process are neglected in the signal region of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurement.

Higher-order QCD corrections are included approximately under the assumption that their effect on SM and its interference with dimension-six operators is similar. Total Higgs boson production cross sections are corrected using the ratio of the best-available SM particle level prediction and the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO + Pythia 8 prediction for the SM. Similary, predicted differential cross sections for the \(WW\) analysis are rescaled in every bin by the ratio of the best SM particle-level prediction with the one obtained from MadGraph5_aMC@NLO + Pythia 8. Predictions for \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) and \(gg\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) production are rescaled separately. The total cross section of the particle level predictions used for this correction is normalized to higher-order predictions. Finally, it is also assumed that theory uncertainties derived for the SM processes remain valid in the presence of dimension-six operators. Details on the SM predictions are given in Section 3.4.

The SMEFT parametrization of the differential cross section for \(pp\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) production in the phase space of the \(WW\) analysis and for the ggF and VBF signal strength times branching ratio into \(e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) is summarized in Figure 1.

### Acceptance corrections

The observed Higgs boson signal strength depends not only on the Higgs boson production cross section and branching ratios but also the acceptance and efficiency, i.e., the fraction of events that pass the selection requirements and can be observed in the detector. The acceptance is defined as the fraction of events that are within the analysis phase space at particle level, while the efficiency is the fraction of these events that are reconstructed and analyzed. Both acceptance and efficiency depend on the effect of dimension-six operators that modify the kinematics of Higgs boson production and decay. Acceptance effects are expected to be dominant and no efficiency corrections are derived. The acceptance of the interference of dimension-six operators with the SM is calculated analogously to the acceptance of a physical process, using the particle level samples that represent interference effects, which are introduced in Section 3.2. In the ggF search region of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis, the influence of \(\mathcal{O}_{HW}\) and \(\mathcal{O}_{H1}^{(3)}\) on Higgs boson decay kinematics leads to an acceptance that differs from the SM acceptance. All other operators affecting Higgs boson decays only introduce an overall scaling of the branching ratio. The interference of \(\mathcal{O}_{HW}\) with the SM has a 10% higher acceptance than the SM signal while the \(\mathcal{O}_{H1}^{(3)}\) interference term has an acceptance that is 1.8% lower than the SM. A multiplicative correction to the linear coefficients \(B_{i}^{H\to e\nu\mu\nu}\) corresponding

In order to illustrate experimental sensitivity to these effects in data, the expected total uncertainty on each modifier is shown in the top panel. \(\Lambda=1\) TeV is assumed and the values of Wilson coefficients are chosen such that the impact of all operators is of similar size, for better visibility.

operator to these operators, is introduced to correct for the modified acceptance. It is assumed that the effects of dimension-six operators in Higgs boson production have only negligible impact on the analysis acceptance. The effect of dim-6 operators on the shape of the transverse mass1 distribution, which is used to obtain constraints on the signal strength in a maximum-likelihood fit, is negligible.

Footnote 1: The transverse mass is defined as \(m_{\mathrm{T}}=\sqrt{(E_{\mathrm{T,}e\mu}+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})^{2}-( \vec{p}_{\mathrm{T,}e\mu}+\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})^{2}}\), where \(E_{\mathrm{T,}e\mu}=\sqrt{[\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T,}e\mu}]^{2}+m_{e\mu}^{2}}\) and \(\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) are the missing transverse momentum and its magnitude, respectively.

In the analysis region targeting VBF production, a boosted decision tree (BDT) is used to select events that are compatible with a VBF topology and exhibit lepton kinematics that are compatible with a Higgs boson decay. The binned BDT output is fit in a maximum-likelihood fit using SM templates for signal and backgrounds. In the presence of dimension-six operators, which can affect both Higgs boson production and decay kinematics, the distribution of the BDT output differs from the SM expectation for a \(H\to WW^{*}\) signal. The fit is most sensitive to signal events in the signal-enriched bins of the BDT distribution so that an increased or decreased fraction of events in that bin is expected to increase or decrease the sensitivity to the effect of the operator, respectively. The impact of dimension-six operators on the BDT shape is evaluated at particle level. For the interference of \(\mathcal{O}_{Hq}^{(1)}\) and \(\mathcal{O}_{HB}\) with the SM, the fraction of events in the signal-enriched BDT bins differs by up to 50% from the SM expectation. However, \(\mathcal{O}_{Hq}^{(1)}\) only has a small impact on VBF production and is mainly constrained by the \(WW\) analysis while \(\mathcal{O}_{HB}\) also affects the total Higgs boson width, due to its impact on other Higgs boson decay channels and modifies the branching ratio to \(H\to e^{\pm}\nu\mu^{\mp}\nu\). Since the sensitivity to these operators originates elsewhere, changes in the BDT shape therefore do not have a significant effect on the results of the combination. Up to 10% differences in the fraction of events in the signal-rich BDT bins are observed for \(\mathcal{O}_{HW}\), \(\mathcal{O}_{HWB}\), \(\mathcal{O}_{Hu}\), \(\mathcal{O}_{Hd}\), and \(O_{Hq}^{(3)}\). Only for \(\mathcal{O}_{HW}\) is the constraining power of VBF is similar to the remaining measurements. For \(c_{HW}\) this analysis likely underestimates the limit obtained on that coefficient. Since the exact size of the effect is difficult to estimate at particle level and because uncertainties on the VBF measurement are relatively large, no correction is applied.

The impact of dimension-six operators on the \(WW\) background in the \(H\to WW^{*}\) signal region is evaluated after applying selection cuts that corresponds to the reconstruction-level event-selection. Acceptance effects are thus accounted for.

The differential cross section measured in the \(WW\) analysis is reported for a fiducial phase space that is defined by requirements that are very similar to the data selection and SMEFT predictions are evaluated in this phase space. Little model-dependent extrapolation is needed for the calculation of the measured fiducial cross section and the result is assumed to remain valid also in the presence of dimension-six operator effects. Similar, the unfolding of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead.\,\,lep.}}\) distribution is also expected to be fairly model-independent as it mostly corrects for detector effects that do not strongly depend on the model used for the hard process.

### Simulation of SM processes

For the interpretation of both analyses, \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) production is modelled using the Sherpa 2.2.2[17] generator at NLO accuracy in QCD for up to one additional parton, and LO accuracy for up to three additional parton emissions. The NNPDF3.0NNLO set of parton distribution functions (PDF) is used [18], along with the dedicated set of tuned parton-shower parameters developed by the Sherpa authors. The total \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) cross section predicted by this generator configuration is in good agreement with the NNLO cross section [19; 20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 25; 26]. In the phase space of the \(WW\) analysis, the \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) sample is augmented by a matrix element calculation of \(gg\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) production based on the OpenLoops library [23; 26] that includes off-shell effects and Higgs boson contributions. It incorporates up to one additional parton emission at LO and is matched and merged with the Sherpa parton shower based on Catani-Seymour dipole [27; 28] using the MEPS@NLO prescription [29; 30; 31; 32]. The same parton shower and PDFs as for the \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) sample are employed. The \(gg\)-induced process is normalized to its NLO cross section [33].

In the signal region of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis, SM \(gg\to WW\) production is simulated with the same setup as used for the \(WW\) analysis but excluding \(s\)-channel Higgs boson contributions. SM ggF Higgs boson production is simulated using Powheg[34; 35; 36; 37] NNLOPS [38; 39] with the PDF4LHC15 NNLO set of parton distribution functions [40]. The simulation achieves NNLO accuracy for arbitrary inclusive \(gg\to H\) observables by reweighting the Higgs boson rapidity spectrum in Hj-MiNLO [41] to that of HNNLO [19]. The transverse momentum spectrum of the Higgs boson obtained with this sample was found to be compatible within uncertainties with the resummed NNLO+NNLL HRes2.3 calculation [42; 43]. Events are interfaced with Pythia 8.210 employing the parameter values of the AZNLO tune [44] for underlying event, showering and hadronization. The gluon fusion prediction from the MC samples is normalized to the N\({}^{3}\)LO cross section in QCD plus electroweak corrections at NLO [45; 46; 47; 48; 49]. The VBF production process is generated with Powheg and interfaced with Pythia 8.210 for parton showering and hadronization using the A14 tune. The MC prediction is normalized to an approximate-NNLO QCD cross section with NLO electroweak corrections [45; 50; 51; 52]. For these signal samples and for the modelling of background processes the same generators and settings are used as in the \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurement [3].

## 4 Statistical model

### Statistical model used for the interpretation of the \(Ww\) measurement

The probability density function used in the interpretation of the unfolded \(WW\) measurement is based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution. Experimental and theory uncertainties are modelled with nuisance parameters constrained by Gaussian distributions that represent auxiliary measurements as well as theoretical expectations.

The prediction of the analyzed \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm lead.\ lep.}\) distribution depends on the set of Wilson coefficients \(\epsilon\), which is listed in Table 1, and is also subject to theory systematics, for example factorization and normalization scale uncertainties, which are parametrized by theory nuisance parameters. For a given theory nuisance parameter configuration \(\theta_{\rm theo\ syst}^{WW}=(\theta_{1},\ldots,\theta_{j},\ldots,\theta_{n_{ \rm theo\ syst}^{WW}})\), where \(n_{\rm theo\ syst}^{WW}\) is the number of theory nuisance parameters affecting the signal predictions, the predicted fiducial cross section in a bin \(b\) of the unfolded \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm lead.\ lep.}\) distribution is parametrized as

\[x_{b}^{\rm pred}\left(\epsilon,\theta_{\rm theo\ syst}^{WW}\right)=x_{b}^{\rm SM }\left(1+\sum_{i}c_{i}A_{b,i}\right)\times\prod_{j}^{n_{\rm theo\ syst}^{WW}} \left(1+\theta_{j}u_{b,j}\right)\,, \tag{7}\]

where \(u_{b,j}\) is the relative size of the uncertainty \(j\) in bin \(b\). Here it is assumed that the nature and relative effect of theory uncertainties is the same for linear EFT effects as for the SM, as explained in Section 3.2.

The measured cross section depends on the model that is used to subtract backgrounds, to calculate detector efficiencies, and to unfold distributions. Uncertainties of this model can be parametrized with experimental nuisance parameters \(\mathbf{\theta}_{\text{exp syst}}^{WW}=(\theta_{1},\dots,\theta_{j},\dots,\theta_{n_{ \text{exp syst}}})\), where \(n_{\text{exp syst}}^{WW}\) is the number of experimental nuisance parameters affecting the measurement. The nominal result of the \(WW\) measurement corresponds to a model in which all nuisance parameters are set to their nominal values. Alternative results that correspond to \(1\sigma\) variations of each of the nuisance parameters, are also available. This information is used to calculate an alternative measurement result that is a function of the nuisance parameter values:

\[x_{b}^{\text{meas}}\left(\mathbf{\theta}_{\text{exp syst}}^{WW}\right)=x_{b}\times \prod_{j}^{n_{\text{exp syst}}^{WW}}\left(1+\theta_{j}v_{b,j}\right), \tag{8}\]

where \(x_{b}\) is the nominal measurement result and \(v_{b,j}\) is the relative impact of the systematic variation \(j\) on the measured cross section in bin \(b\). The measured cross section has little model dependence and thus does not depend on the values of Wilson coefficients and theory nuisance parameters, as motivated in Section 3.3.

The nominal measured differential cross section, in \(n_{\text{bins}}^{WW}=14\) bins, is given by \(\mathbf{x}\). Statistical uncertainties of the unfolded data are correlated and encoded in a covariance matrix \(C\). The likelihood \(L^{WW}\left(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}^{WW}\right)\), which is modelled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution and is a function of the Wilson coefficients \(\mathbf{c}\) as well as the union of experimental and theory nuisance parameters, \(\mathbf{\theta}^{WW}\), is then given by

\[\begin{split} L^{WW}\,\left(\mathbf{x}\big{|}\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}^{WW} \right)=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(2\pi\right)^{n_{\text{bins}}^{WW} }\det\left(C\right)}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta\mathbf{x}^{\top}\left(\mathbf{c}, \mathbf{\theta}^{WW}\right)C^{-1}\Delta\mathbf{x}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}^{WW}\right) \right)\\ &\times\prod_{i}^{n_{\text{syst}}^{WW}}f_{i}\left(\theta_{i}^{WW} \right).\end{split} \tag{9}\]

Here \(n_{\text{syst}}^{WW}\) is the total number of experimental and theory nuisance parameters, \(f_{i}\) correspond to the Gaussian constraints on nuisance parameters while the vector \(\Delta\mathbf{x}\) represents the difference between measurement and prediction and its components \(\Delta x_{b}\) are defined as

\[\Delta x_{b}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}^{WW}\right)=x_{b}^{\text{meas}}\left(\bm {\theta}_{\text{exp syst}}^{WW}\right)-x_{b}^{\text{pred}}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{ \theta}_{\text{theo syst}}^{WW}\right). \tag{10}\]

### Statistical model used for the interpretation of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurement

The likelihood for the interpretation of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) signal strength measurement is based on the likelihood definition used to extract the ggF and VBF signal strength in the measurement of Ref. [3]. For each analysis bin \(b\) of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurement, both in signal and control regions, the likelihood associated with the observation of \(N_{b}\) signal events is modelled as a Poisson distribution

\[L_{b}^{HWW}\,\left(N_{b}\big{|}\{\mu_{p}\},\mathbf{\theta}^{HW}\right)=\text{ Poisson}\left(N_{b}\bigg{|}\sum_{p}\mu_{p}S_{p,b}\,\left(\mathbf{\theta}^{HW} \right)+B_{b}\,\left(\mathbf{\theta}^{HW}\right)\right), \tag{11}\]

where \(B_{b}\) is the expected background yield and \(S_{p,b}\) the expected number of signal events for each of the Higgs production processes while \(\mu_{p}\) is a signal strength parameter that represents the cross section times branching ratio of the production process \(p\) (ggH or VBF) divided by the SM expectation. Both \(B_{b}\) and \(S_{p,b}\) depend on the set of nuisance parameters \(\theta^{HW\,W}\) as both the expected signal and background yield are subject to uncertainties in the modelling of experimental effects and in the theoretical prediction of signal as well as background processes. The \(WW\) background is determined in a combined fit that includes control regions that are relatively pure in \(WW\) production.

For the purpose of EFT interpretation, the signal strength parameters \(\mu_{p}\) are re-parametrized in terms of Wilson coefficients,

\[\mu_{p}(\mathbf{c})=1+\sum_{i}A_{i}^{p}c_{i}+\sum_{i}c_{i}B_{i}^{H\to e\nu\mu\nu}- \sum_{i}c_{i}B_{i}^{\rm tot}, \tag{12}\]

as outlined in Equation 6. The likelihood for the \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis, which includes all \(n_{\rm bins}^{\rm SR+CR}\) analysis bins in signal and control regions as well as constraint terms \(f_{i}\) on nuisance parameters is then defined as

\[\begin{split} L^{HW\,W}\left(N\big{|}\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}^{HW\,W} \right)&=\prod_{b}^{n_{\rm bins}^{\rm SR+CR}}\text{Poisson} \left(N_{b}\middle|\sum_{p}\mu_{p}\left(\mathbf{c}\right)S_{p,b}\left(\mathbf{\theta}^ {HW\,W}\right)+B_{b}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}^{HW\,W}\right)\right)\\ &\prod_{i}^{n_{\rm syst}^{HWW}}f_{i}\left(\theta_{i}^{HW\,W} \right),\end{split} \tag{13}\]

where \(N=(N_{1},\ldots,N_{b},\ldots,N_{n_{\rm bins}^{\rm SR+CR}})\) is the observed number of events in the analysis bins. The background \(B_{b}\) depends not only on nuisance parameters but also on Wilson coefficients, whose effect on the \(WW\) background is taken into account.

### Combined likelihood and fit

The likelihoods from the \(WW\) and \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurements are combined to allow a coherent EFT analysis of both measurements. Systematic uncertainties due to identical sources are parametrized with the same nuisance parameter in both measurements so that the total number of nuisance parameters \(n_{\rm syst}^{\rm comb}\) is less than the sum of \(n_{\rm syst}^{WW}\) and \(n_{\rm syst}^{HW\,W}\). In total 332 nuisance parameters affect the interpretation of both measurements while 285 affect only the \(H\to WW^{*}\) and 137 only the \(WW\) measurement.

The \(WW\) control regions of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurements overlap with the \(WW\) analysis phase space, as explained in Section 2. For the combination, these are removed and the overall normalization of the \(WW\) background in the \(H\to WW^{*}\) signal regions is no longer determined from a combined fit of control and signal regions. The \(WW\) background normalization is instead modelled analogously to the signal parametrization in the \(WW\) measurement, which is a product of the SM prediction, its uncertainties, and an EFT parametrization, as shown in Equation 7. Uncertainties affecting \(WW\) production are treated as fully correlated between the \(WW\) and \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurements so that inclusion of the \(WW\) measurement in the fit reduces the uncertainty on the \(WW\) background yield in the \(H\to WW^{*}\) signal region.

The combined likelihood, for an observation of \(N\) events in the \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis bins and a measured differential cross section of \(\mathbf{x}\) in the \(WW\) analysis, is then given by

\[\begin{split} L^{\text{comb}}\left(N,\mathbf{x}\big{|}\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta }^{\text{comb}}\right)&=\prod_{b\notin\text{WW-CR}}^{n_{\text{ bins}}^{\text{SR+CR}}}\text{Poisson}\left(N_{b}\left|\sum_{P}\mu_{P}\left(\mathbf{c} \right)S_{P}\left(\mathbf{\theta}^{HWW}\right)+B\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}^{HWW} \right)\right)\\ &\times\frac{1}{\sqrt{\left(2\pi\right)^{n_{\text{bins}}^{WW}} \det\left(C\right)}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\Delta\mathbf{x}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta }^{WW}\right)^{\top}C^{-1}\Delta\mathbf{x}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}^{WW}\right) \right)\\ &\times\prod_{i}^{n_{\text{syst}}^{\text{comb}}}f_{i}\left(\theta _{i}^{\text{comb}}\right).\end{split} \tag{14}\]

For the estimation of confidence intervals for a Wilson coefficient \(c_{i}\), a profile likelihood ratio test statistic is constructed from the likelihood:

\[\lambda\left(c_{i}\right)=-2\log\frac{L\left(c_{i},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)}{L \left(\hat{c_{i}},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)}. \tag{15}\]

Here \(L\left(c_{i},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)\) is the maximum of the likelihood for fixed \(c_{i}\) and \(L\left(\hat{c_{i}},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)\) the value at the absolute maximum of the likelihood. Maximum likelihood fits are performed for individual Wilson coefficients by setting other coefficients to zero and maximizing the likelihood with respect to the nuisance parameters. Additionally, simultaneous fits are performed for multiple parameters by also profiling other parameters of interest, i.e. maximizing the likelihood with respect to both nuisance parameters and other Wilson coefficients. Confidence intervals are derived using Wilks' theorem [53], assuming that the profile likelihood test statistic is \(\chi^{2}\) distributed [54].

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

Both measurements are subject to various systematic uncertainties. The dominant experimental uncertainty sources arise from the modelling of jet energy scale and resolution, \(b\)-tagging efficiency, luminosity measurement, pile-up, as well as lepton identification and isolation efficiency. The main background uncertainties are related to the modelling of the \(t\bar{t}\) and single top quark background as well as the background due to non-prompt and misidentified leptons. Each uncertainty source is modelled with one or multiple nuisance parameters. The same nuisance parameters model common systematic uncertainties that affect both measurements. All dominant uncertainty sources listed above are treated as correlated between measurements, except for those related to the non-prompt background estimate, as different estimation methods are used.

Theoretical uncertainties in the modelling of signal processes also play an important role. They are evaluated for the SM processes and it is assumed that the relative uncertainty in each analysis bin remains valid in the presence of dimension-six EFT operators. The uncertainty of the total \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) production cross section, which is calculated at NNLO QCD with the MATRIX framework, is estimated by varying factorization and renormalization scales by a factor of two, by taking into account the NNPDF3.0NNLO uncertainty, and by a comparison with the MMHT2014 [55] and CT14nnlo [56] PDF sets. It is found to be 4.3%. Additionally, shape and acceptance uncertainties on the particle level prediction of \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) production are taken into account. These arise due to the choice of factorization and normalization scale, the parton distribution function, matrix element generator, parton shower, and the matrix element parton shower merging. They are evaluated coherently for predictions in the \(WW\) and \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis phase space. Modelling uncertainties are treated as correlated between the \(H\to WW^{*}\) and \(WW\) measurements. This allows to correctly take into account these theoretical uncertainties when extrapolating the \(pp\to WW\) process from the \(WW\) analysis to the \(H\to WW^{*}\) signal regions. For Higgs boson production, off-shell \(gg\to WW\) production, and other background processes the same uncertainties as already evaluated for the \(WW\) and \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurements are assumed.

## 6 Results

To determine deviations between SM predictions and measurements in each region, a simultaneous measurement of 16 signal strength parameters is performed: the two signal strength parameters of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis and 14 signal strength parameters that scale the predicted SM cross section in each bin of the \(WW\) analysis. The measurement is performed using a likelihood function that is identical to the combined likelihood defined in Equation 14, except for the introduction of per-bin signal strength parameters for the \(WW\) measurement and the removal of the Wilson-coefficient dependence. Results are presented in Figure 2. The central values of the measured \(H\to WW^{*}\) signal strengths differ by less than 2% from the standalone measurement. A 10% degradation of the precision of the ggF signal strength measurement is introduced due to the replacement of the \(WW\) control region with the \(WW\) measurement while the VBF measurement precision is unaffected. The \(WW\) signal strengths, in bins of \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm lead.\;lep.}\), are similar to the ratio of unfolded data to the SM prediction that is presented in the original measurement. Differences in this ratio arise because nuisance parameters that parametrize uncertainties on the measurement or the differential \(WW\) cross section prediction are pulled from their nominal value in the maximum likelihood fit. The signal strength results are not directly used in the SMEFT interpretation. In the following, the signal strength parameters are instead reparameterized in terms of Wilson coefficients, as described in Section 4.

Also shown in Figure 2 are limits on each Wilson coefficient \(c_{i}\), with all the other coefficients fixed to the SM value of zero. Limits obtained from the analysis of the \(WW\) measurement, the \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurement, and the combination of the two analyses are compared. Constraints from the combined measurement agree with the SM expectation at the level of two standard deviations or better. The numerically strongest constraints are obtained on \(c_{HG}\) and \(c_{uG}\), which both affect ggF Higgs boson production, on \(c_{Hq}^{(\ref{eq:WW})}\), which affects \(q\bar{q}\to WW\) production as well as Higgs boson production through VBF, and on \(c_{lq}^{(\ref{eq:WW})}\), which modifies the high-energy tail of the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm lead.\;lep.}\) distribution in \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) production. For the Wilson coefficients \(c_{Hl}^{(\ref{eq:WW})}\), \(c_{uW}\), \(c_{uB}\), \(c_{eH}\), obtained constraints are of order 50 or worse and these coefficients are ignored in the following. The uncertainty of the combination is not always smaller than the uncertainties of the individual measurements, as the removal of the \(WW\) control region of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis, leads to a reduced sensitivity of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) measurement. Large deviations from zero are observed for \(c_{W}\), \(c_{II}^{(\ref{eq:WW})}\) and \(c_{HI}^{(\ref{eq:WW})}\) in the analysis of the \(WW\) measurement. The deviations of \(c_{II}^{(\ref{eq:WW})}\) and \(c_{HI}^{(\ref{eq:WW})}\) can be explained by the fact that the fiducial cross section measured in the \(WW\) analysis is larger than the SM expectation, as \(c_{II}^{(\ref{eq:WW})}\) and \(c_{HI}^{(\ref{eq:WW})}\) only change the normalization of the signal in this phase space region. A large value of the \(c_{W}\) coefficient is preferred as it reduces the slope in the ratio of observation and prediction for the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm lead.\;lep.}\) distribution.

Figure 2: Left: Measured signal strengths from the combined fit of signal-strength modifiers in bins of the \(WW\) analysis and for the two signal strength modifiers of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis. Statistical uncertainties are shown in yellow, systematic uncertainties as blue bars and the total uncertainties are indicated by a black lines. The compatibility of the observed data with the SM hypothesis (\(p_{\rm SM}\)) is 53%. Right: Observed limits on individual Wilson coefficients, while setting other Wilson coefficients to zero. Limits observed from an analysis of the SM \(WW\), the \(H\to WW^{*}\), and the combined measurements are compared. The standalone \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis is not identical to the one that enters the combination, where the \(WW\) 0-jet and 1-jet control regions are removed. 68% (95%) confidence level intervals are shown as solid (dotted) lines. Portions of the confidence intervals outside the boundaries of the figure are clipped and different parameter value axis limits are used for illustrative purposes. If a measurement has no sensitivity to a Wilson coefficient, no interval is drawn. \(\Lambda=1\) TeV is assumed. Details of the fits can be found in Section 4.

The data in the two measurements contain insufficient information to constrain all coefficients \(c_{i}\) in a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit. Multiple degrees of freedom are left unconstrained by the data, which manifests as flat directions in the likelihood. Flat and sensitive directions of the likelihood need to be identified to understand the strengths of this combination, to understand where additional measurements are needed to remove degeneracies, and to increase the numerical stability of the likelihood analysis. To identify these directions, a rotation in the space of Wilson coefficients is performed, as outlined in Refs. [57, 58], to determine a modified basis that consists of linear combinations of the Warsaw basis vectors. The covariance matrix \(V_{\text{meas}}\) of the two Higgs signal strength parameters and the 14 signal strength parameters that scale the cross section measured in each bin of the \(WW\) measurement is analyzed. The corresponding correlation matrix \(C_{\text{meas}}\) is visualized in Figure 3. The Hessian matrix \(V_{\text{meas}}^{-1}\) is reparametrized in terms of Wilson coefficients using the parameterization matrix \(P_{\mu\leftrightarrow c_{i}}\), which maps the signal strength parameters to linear combinations of EFT coefficients as outlined in Section 3.1, to obtain the Fisher information matrix

\[V_{\text{SMEFT}}^{-1}=P_{\mu\longleftrightarrow c_{i}}^{T}V_{\text{meas}}^{-1 }P_{\mu^{\text{x}}\leftrightarrow c_{i}}. \tag{16}\]

Figure 4 lists eigenvectors \(c_{j}\) and eigenvalues of the Fisher information matrix. The eigenvalues provide a handle on the expected limits that can be obtained: assuming Gaussian uncertainties, the expected uncertainty for a measurement of an eigenvector is inversely proportional to the square root of the eigenvalue. The first eight directions are shown. They correspond to an eigenvalue of \(\lambda\gtrsim 0.01\), which corresponds to an expected uncertainty of less than 10. These eigenvectors, which each probe linear combinations of large numbers of Wilson coefficients, are not directly measured.

In order to improve the interpretability of the measurement, parameter groups are defined that each contain Wilson coefficients with a similar physics impact. \(c_{W}\) is treated as its own subgroup, as its physics effect is unique in that it only affects weak boson self couplings. \(c_{H\bar{G}}\), \(c_{uG}\), and \(c_{uH}\) form a group as these operators affect ggF Higgs production. \(c_{H\bar{I}}^{(3)}\) and \(c_{\bar{I}}^{(1)}\) form a group as both lead to a shift of the Fermi constant \(G_{\text{F}}\) and mainly change the normalization of the observed processes. The coefficients \(c_{l\mu}\), \(c_{lq}^{(3)}\), \(c_{lq}^{(1)}\), \(c_{ld}\), \(c_{Hd}\), \(c_{Hu}\), \(c_{Hq}^{(1)}\), and \(c_{Hq}^{(3)}\) are grouped because their most important effect is the modification of \(q\bar{q}\to e^{\pm}v_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) production at high parton centre-of-mass energies. They affect both effective boson-fermion and four-fermion couplings. The next two group contains \(c_{H\bar{B}}\), \(c_{H\bar{W}}\), \(c_{H\bar{W}B}\). These parameters affect Higgs boson decays into \(e^{\pm}v_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) and VBF production. The effect of the parameters of the final group, \(c_{dH}\), \(c_{HDD}\), and \(c_{H\Box}\), is similar for both Higgs-boson measurements.

Eigenvectors of the new grouping, referred to as the subspace rotation, are shown in Table 2. The impact of variations of the rotated fit parameters \(c_{j}\) on the measured signal strength is shown in Figure 5. Eigenvectors that correspond to weakly constrainted directions are fixed to zero. These weakly constrained directions are identified by selecting directions which have an uncertainty larger than 10 when considered with the fit directions. Profile-likelihood scans are used to confirm the sensitivity estimate based on the eigenvector analysis. In total, eight eigenvectors are measured simultaneously. They are indicated in Table 2 and visualized in Figure 6. One of the sensitive directions aligns, by construction, with \(c_{W}\). The \(c_{H\bar{I}^{(3)},\bar{I}\bar{I}^{(1)}}^{\text{1}}\) eigenvector changes the normalization of \(WW\) production and affects the VBF and ggF production rates. The second linear combination of these two coefficients, \(c_{H\bar{I}^{(3)},\bar{I}\bar{I}^{(1)}}^{\text{2}}\), mainly effects the rate of VBF Higgs boson production while \(c_{uG,H\bar{G},uH}^{\text{[1]}}\) modifies the ggF-production rate. The main effect of \(c_{lu,Iq^{(3)},\bar{I}q^{(1)},\bar{I}d,Hd,Hu,Hq^{(1)},Hq^{(3)}}^{\text{1}}\) is a change in the rate of \(WW\) and VBF Higgs boson production while the remaining operators of that group modify the tail of the \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{lead.\,\,lep.}}\) distribution. No eigenvector of the last two groups in Table 2 has an expected sensitivity above the threshold of ten when included in the Figure 3: Expected correlation matrix of the signal strength modifiers of the \(H\to WW^{*}\) analysis and the \(WW\) measurement.

analysis. The corresponding operators affect the rate of Higgs-boson production and decay. Only two degrees of freedom can be constrained by the two signal-strength measurements, and these are \(c_{HH^{(3)},II^{(1)}}^{[2]}\) and \(c_{uG,HG,uH}^{[1]}\), following the methodology used for these results.

Constraints on eigenvectors and their correlation are shown in Figure 7. All the measurements agree with the SM expectation at the level of one standard deviation. Four parameters can be measured with a precision of better than 1.

The combination with additional measurements of Higgs-boson production and decay is required to improve constraints and reduce the number of blind directions in the subspace of operators that affect the Higgs sector. The combination with additional measurements of single and multiboson production can help to improve the constraints on the remaining operators and reduce degeneracies among the parameters that affect boson-fermion and four-fermion couplings.

## 7 Conclusion

Effective field theory operators are constrained in a combined analysis of a measurement of \(H\to WW^{*}\to e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) in the gluon-fusion and vector-boson fusion production modes and a differential cross-section measurement in \(WW\) production in the \(e^{\pm}\nu_{e}\mu^{\mp}\nu_{\mu}\) decay channel. The measurements are based on 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at \(\sqrt{s}\) =13 TeV. The two conceptually different measurements are combined in a coherent statistical framework. The combination considers the effect of 20 CP-even Wilson coefficients in the SMEFT framework and is able to constrain eight degrees of freedom simultaneously. Limits obtained from fits of individual parameters and from fits of multiple sensitive directions are reported. No significant deviations from the SM are found.
