# Jet Mass Resolution in ATLAS using Run 2 Monte Carlo Simulation

The ATLAS Collaboration

The ATLAS Collaboration

The jet mass resolution (JMR) and its uncertainty are amongst the limiting systematic effects for precision measurements and searches for physics beyond the Standard Model. This note presents the latest ATLAS Run 2 Monte Carlo-based determination of the JMR for anti-\(k_{\rm t}\) jets of radius \(R\) = 1.0 and \(R\) = 0.4 used to reconstruct events with QCD, \(H\to b\bar{b}\), top, and \(W/Z\) jet topologies in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV. Two different approaches for correcting the JMR in Monte Carlo simulation to match that of data and propagating the relevant uncertainties are compared. The first is based on Gaussian smearing of the jet mass and the second, forward-folding, is a transformation based on information derived in \(in\ situ\) measurements using Run 2 data and simulation. The propagation of uncertainties on the JMR is studied using these two approaches in order to demonstrate the impact of the assumption that the jet mass response has a Gaussian shape. The two methods are found to provide similar results for \(W\) jets, but to differ when applied to top jets.

## 1 Introduction

The jet mass is the Lorentz-invariant square of the jet four-momentum (\(p^{2}=m^{2}=E^{2}-\vec{p}^{2}\)). A perturbative description of the jet mass [1] shows that its value and its distribution are determined by the spatial extent of the jet, intuitively associated to parton branching, the jet momentum and the nature of the parent parton, being quark or gluon.

The jet mass plays an important role in identifying (and tagging [2]) the hadronic decays of top quarks and heavy bosons (\(W\), \(Z\), Higgs) and in differentiating between them. When parent particles have a large transverse momentum compared to their mass, their hadronic decays result in highly collimated ("boosted") decay products that are more efficiently reconstructed into a single large-radius jet. The information about the decay products is incorporated in the jet substructure [3, 4], such as the invariant mass of the jet. Resonant peaks are absent in the invariant mass distribution derived from jets originating from gluon, \(b\)-, \(c\)-, or light-quark jets (QCD jets). Such jets feature only a low mass logarithmic enhancement 1 followed by a phase-space-induced decline. The use of these techniques allows for the selection and reconstruction of event samples of final states containing \(W/Z\), top, and \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets in order to measure their differential kinematic properties and/or to search for resonant and non-resonant deviations from the Standard Model (SM) predictions. A detector's ability to exercise jet mass discrimination, i.e. to resolve jets with different masses, is quantified by the jet mass resolution (JMR). Estimating the JMR and developing a reliable and testable methodology for the propagation of its systematic uncertainties forms the basis for this note.

Footnote 1: The leading order mass differential cross-section \(\frac{d\sigma}{dM^{2}}\approx\frac{\alpha_{s}}{M^{2}}\log(\frac{R^{2}p_{\rm T }^{2}}{M^{2}})\) where \(R\), \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(M\) are the jet radius, transverse momentum and mass, respectively [1].

During Run 2, the ATLAS collaboration has developed a data-driven method to determine the relative difference in the JMR between data and simulation, called forward-folding. Associated techniques to reduce the size of both the JMR and its systematic uncertainty were developed [5, 6]. This is done by incorporating information from tracks and from control samples enriched in highly boosted \(W\) and top jets. Such developments have significantly contributed to successive studies to determine the large-radius jet mass resolution [7] and scale [8]. New studies on reconstructing large-radius jets by using calibrated smaller-radius jets made from calorimeter topological clusters [9] ("reclustered jets") show potential to reduce JMR and to profit from the propagation of calibrations and systematic uncertainties that are precisely determined from data using \(in\ situ\) techniques. Quantifying the JMR of smaller-radius jets provides an understanding of the reclustered jet behaviour, including when the reclustered jet is comprised of a single small-radius jet. The JMR for small-radius jets will be briefly discussed and quantified in several topologies: \(W/Z\), top, \(H\to b\bar{b}\), and QCD jets.

This note will first provide brief descriptions of the ATLAS detector (Section 2), the simulated events used for these studies (Section 3) and the algorithms and properties of the jets themselves (Section 4). In Section 5 the JMR is defined and the procedure for its evaluation in Monte Carlo (MC) events is presented. The Gaussian smearing technique is applied in the context of propagating systematic uncertainties on the MC JMR to both small and large-radius jets for topologies containing \(W/Z\), top, Higgs and QCD jets. Next, Sections 6 and 7 describe the application of the forward-folding approach, used to determine the relative difference of the JMR between simulation and data and to propagate its associated systematic uncertainties. Forward-folding will be directly compared with an equivalent variation on Gaussian smearing to study the impact of Gaussian assumptions on the JMR. Conclusions are drawn in Section 8.

## 2 ATLAS Detector

The ATLAS detector [10] is a multi-purpose particle detector with nearly \(4\pi\) in solid angle coverage 2. From its center outwards ATLAS consists of a radial sequence of sub-detectors: an inner tracking detector, a set of sampling electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and a muon spectrometer for precision muon reconstruction.

Footnote 2: The ATLAS reference system is a Cartesian right-handed coordinate system, with the nominal collision point at the origin. The anti-clockwise beam direction defines the positive \(z\)-axis, while the positive \(x\)-axis is defined as pointing from the collision point to the center of the LHC ring and the positive \(y\)-axis points upwards. The azimuthal angle \(\phi\) is measured around the beam axis, and the polar angle \(\theta\) is measured relative to the \(z\)-axis. Pseudo-rapidity is defined as \(\eta=-\ln[\tan(\theta/2)]\). \(\Delta R\) between two four-momenta \(p_{i}\) and \(p_{j}\) is defined as \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(q_{i}-\eta_{j})^{2}+(\phi_{i}-\phi_{j})^{2}}\) where \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) are the pseudorapidities and azimuthal angles associated with the two four-momenta.

The inner tracking detector is immersed in a 2 T magnetic field, provided by a solenoid, and is used to measure charged-particle trajectories. The inner detector is composed of silicon pixel and microstrip detectors covering the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\) and a straw-tube transition radiation tracker covering the pseudorapidity region \(|\eta|<2.0\). The innermost layer, known as the insertable B-Layer [11], was added in 2014 and provides high-resolution measurements at small radius to enhance the tracking performance.

A set of sampling calorimeters surround the solenoid and inner detector, providing high precision electromagnetic and hadronic energy measurements. Lead/liquid-argon electromagnetic sampling calorimeters are used in both the barrel (\(|\eta|<1.5\)) and endcap (1.4 < \(|\eta|\) < 3.2) regions. A steel/scintillating-tile hadronic calorimeter is used in the barrel region (\(|\eta|<1.7\)) and two endcap copper/liquid-argon sections extend to higher pseudorapidity (\(1.5<|\eta|<3.2\)). Finally, the forward region (\(3.1<|\eta|<4.9\)) is covered by a liquid-argon calorimeter with Cu (W) absorber in the electromagnetic (hadronic) section.

Outside of the calorimeter is a muon spectrometer: a system of detectors for triggering up to \(|\eta|<2.4\), and with precision tracking chambers up to \(|\eta|<2.7\) inside a magnetic field supplied by three large superconducting toroid magnets.

## 3 Monte Carlo Samples

Samples of simulated events for proton-proton (\(pp\)) collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV are used to study the detector response and JMR of various mass reconstruction techniques. Table 1 summarizes the samples used for the studies in this note. More details about the simulation settings are found in Refs. [12, 13, 14, 15].

QCD jets are used to derive the calibration factors for the jet mass scale. The exotic production of \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons [16, 17] provides a copious source of simulated boosted \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons, and of top quarks, respectively. The graviton [18] production provides a source of di-Higgs states, which decay to \(b\bar{b}\). These "signal" samples are produced with \(W^{\prime}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) boson masses ranging from 400 to 5000 GeV and graviton masses ranging from 400 to 3000 GeV. All simulated samples are generated with multiple \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing (pileup). The simulated events are re-weighted so that the distribution of the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing in simulation matches that observed in the data collected by the ATLAS detector in the years 2015 and 2016, a value of 23.7. The samples are processed using the full ATLAS detector simulation [19], based on Geant 4 [20].

## 4 Object Definitions

### Anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) Jets

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) algorithm [25] with two radius parameters: \(R\) = 1.0 (large-radius) and \(R\) = 0.4 (small-radius). The algorithm is implemented in the FastJet package [26]. Calorimeter jets are built from topological clusters [27] ('topoclusters'), which are sets of adjacent calorimeter cells grouped around cells showing a significant energy above the expected calorimeter noise. The topoclusters are defined to be massless. Using information from test-beam measurements, their reconstructed energy is corrected to reproduce the energy deposited by particles in an electromagnetic shower in the calorimeter. If only such corrections are applied, these are named electromagnetic (EM) scale topoclusters. Using cluster shape variables, additional corrections are added to account for the effects of non-compensation, signal losses due to noise thresholds and energy lost in non-instrumented regions of the detector [28]. This calibration scheme is called local cluster weighting (LCW) and the topoclusters corrected in this manner are defined to be at the LCW scale.

Reconstructed (detector-level) jets are those obtained from simulating the entire chain of the ATLAS detector, from interactions of particles with matter, to signal generation and collection in the sub-detectors, to electronic read-out and calibration. The same reconstruction process is applied to jets measured in data.

'Truth' (generator-level) jets are obtained by applying the anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) algorithm to the stable particles in simulated events that have a lifetime \(\tau\) such that \(c\tau\) > 10 mm. Particles that do not leave significant energy deposits in the calorimeter, i.e. muons and neutrinos, are excluded.

To reduce the impact of physics processes not associated to the primary vertex of the event or from out-of-time collisions (jointly referred to as pileup), a jet 'grooming' procedure called trimming [29; 30] is applied to both detector-level and truth large-radius jets. In order to trim the jet, the jet constituents used to reconstruct each large-radius jet are regrouped into sub-jets of radius parameter \(R_{\mathrm{sub}}\) = 0.2 using the \(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) algorithm. The sub-jets with \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}\) = \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{sub-jet}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) < 0.05 are then removed and the jet four-momentum is rederived from the remaining constituents [29]. Small-radius jets are not trimmed, and instead pileup contributions are accounted for by the combination of two corrections [31]: an area-based \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) density subtraction applied on an event-by-event basis and a residual average pileup correction obtained from MC simulation.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l l l l|} \hline Process & Matrix Element Generator & PDF & Parton Shower & Underlying Event \\  & & & & Tune \\ \hline \(W^{\prime}(\to W/Z)\) & Pythia 8 [21] & NNPDF23LO [22] & Pythia 8 & A14 [23] \\ \(G(\to HH)\) & MadGraph5 [24] & NNPDF23LO & Pythia 8 & A14 \\ \(Z^{\prime}(\to t\bar{t})\) & Pythia 8 & NNPDF23LO & Pythia 8 & A14 \\ QCD jets & Pythia 8 & NNPDF23LO & Pythia 8 & A14 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Overview of the simulated samples used in the present analysis.

### Monte Carlo Jet Calibration

After jet reconstruction, a correction obtained from a sample of simulated QCD jet events is used to restore the reconstructed calorimeter jet energy scale (JES) to the truth jet energy scale. An additional correction is applied to the \(\eta\) of the reconstructed jet to account for a bias relative to truth jets in certain regions of the detector [6]. These calibrations are derived in Monte Carlo, but are applied to both Monte Carlo and data.

After the JES correction is applied, the jet invariant mass is calibrated [6], in light of its sensitivity to higher order soft, wide-angle contributions in the parton shower [1]. The calibration procedure measures the relative magnitude of the detector and truth-level jet masses to obtain a response to correct to the truth level. Additional calibrations are then derived to correct jets measured in data to MC [31]. The mass correction [32] is derived using similar techniques used for the jet energy correction.

### Tracks and Particle Flow

Tracks are reconstructed from the hits produced by charged particles interacting with the inner detector. Tracks are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\geq 500\)\(\mathrm{MeV}\). To reduce fake tracks, they are required to have at least a total of 7 hits in the combination of the pixel and silicon microstrip trackers. The product of the longitudinal impact parameter relative to the primary vertex, \(|z_{0}|\sin\theta\), must be less than 3.0 mm. Additionally the track transverse impact parameter \(|d_{0}|\) relative to the primary vertex must be less than 2.0 mm. Tracks are associated with jets using the _ghost-association_ procedure [33]: this keeps a track in a jet if a massless constituent with negligible energy and the same direction as the track would have been clustered into the jet.

Particle flow objects (PFOs) [34] are also considered in the present studies: they are constructed by matching tracks, which have passed stringent selection criteria, to EM scale topoclusters. The tracks used in the matching must be reconstructed from at least nine hits in the silicon detectors, where no missing hits in the pixel tracker are observed. To avoid double-counting energy, the charged component from the track is compared with its expected deposition in the calorimeter, which is then removed from the corresponding matched topocluster. The algorithm further handles the case of energy being split between multiple adjacent topoclusters. The final PFOs contain tracking information from charged tracks, as well as calorimeter information from the corrected topoclusters. The anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) algorithm is then applied to produce small-radius jets from these PFO inputs, only considering tracks with \(|z_{0}|\sin\theta<3.0\) mm. The resulting particle flow jet energy and mass are then fully calibrated using MC correction factors as previously described.

## 5 Jet Mass Resolution from Monte Carlo

In these studies, two different JMRs will be discussed and evaluated. The starting point is the definition of the reconstructed jet mass using information from calorimeters and tracking detectors. An MC-based JMR is then evaluated from the spread of the difference between detector-level and corresponding truth jet mass in simulated events (Section 5.2). In turn, a data-corrected JMR is obtained by using the JMR relative scale between data and simulation derived using the \(in\ situ\) technique of forward-folding [5, 6] (discussed in Section 6). Finally the propagation of JMR systematic uncertainties is illustrated first forthe MC-based JMR [35], and then for the data-corrected JMR (also referred to as forward-folding JMR). This is presented in Section 7.

### Jet Mass Definitions

Two definitions of the detector-level jet mass, \(m^{\text{reco}}\), are considered for large-radius jets.

The first mass definition is calorimeter based: \(m^{\text{reco}}\) = \(m^{\text{calo}}\), the invariant mass from the sum of the four-momenta of the calorimeter topoclusters [36].

The second mass definition includes information from the tracking detectors, and is expected to improve the JMR, particularly at higher transverse momentum where the coarse calorimeter granularity results in a JMR degradation. The starting point is the track-assisted mass, \(m^{\text{TA}}\), defined as \(m^{\text{TA}}\) = \(m^{\text{track}}\frac{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{calo}}}{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{track}}}\), where \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{calo}}\) is the transverse momentum of the detector-level (calorimeter) jet, \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{track}}\) is the transverse momentum of the four-vector sum of inner-detector tracks that are ghost-associated [37] with the calorimeter jet, and \(m^{\text{track}}\) is the invariant mass of the four-vector sum of the same tracks. The ratio \(\frac{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{calo}}}{p_{\text{T}}^{\text{track}}}\) represents the ratio of the charged-to-neutral jet components. A new mass, \(m^{\text{comb}}\), the so-called combined mass [6, 7] is then defined as:

\[m^{\text{comb}}=w^{\text{calo}}\times m^{\text{calo}}+w^{\text{TA}}\times m^ {\text{TA}}. \tag{1}\]

The two weights are obtained by minimizing the resulting JMR from QCD jets and they are constrained to sum to unity [6]. The goal is to achieve an \(m^{\text{comb}}\) JMR lower than those separately attained by \(m^{\text{TA}}\) and \(m^{\text{calo}}\). The combined mass is defined only for large-radius jets, therefore it is only considered in the large-radius JMR studies. All small-radius jet mass studies are conducted using the calorimeter mass definition, and Particle Flow jets are also considered.

### Jet Mass Resolution from Monte Carlo

To define the MC-based JMR, it is first necessary to define the jet mass response [6] as

\[\mathcal{R}=\frac{m^{\text{reco}}}{m^{\text{true}}}, \tag{2}\]

where \(m^{\text{true}}\) is the mass of the truth jet that is associated with the detector-level jet in the MC event of interest by requiring the \(\Delta R\) separation to be less than some defined value. Only jets matching the selection requirements summarised in Table 2 are considered.

For a given \(m^{\text{reco}}\), the fractional JMR definition in MC simulations [6] is defined as:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l l|l|l|} \hline \hline Jet collection & \multicolumn{4}{c|}{Requirements} \\ \hline  & \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{calo}}\) [GeV] & \(|\eta|\) & Truth-matching & Jet isolation \\ \hline large-radius & \(>200\) & \(<2.0\) & \(\Delta R(\text{reco-truth})<0.5\) & \(\Delta R(\text{reco-reco})>2.5\), \(\Delta R(\text{truth-truth})>1.5\) \\ small-radius & \(>100\) & \(<2.8\) & \(\Delta R(\text{reco-truth})<0.3\) & \(\Delta R(\text{reco-reco})>0.6\), \(\Delta R(\text{truth-truth})>1.0\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: The basic jet selections, truth-matching, and isolation requirements for the MC-based JMR evaluation.

\[\sigma_{\rm MC}=\frac{IQnR(\mathcal{R})}{2\times\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{R})} \tag{3}\]

where \(\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{R})\) denotes the median of the jet mass response distribution and \(IQnR(\mathcal{R})\) is the 68.0% coverage interval of the interquantile range 3 of the jet mass response. The \(IQnR(\mathcal{R})\) is used rather than the standard deviation of a Gaussian fit, as the jet mass response does not always follow a Gaussian distribution. In these studies, when the JMR is calculated it is always a fractional JMR; the 'fractional' word in the text description will be dropped for simplicity.

Footnote 3: Such range is defined as \(q_{84\%}\) - \(q_{16\%}\), where \(q_{84\%}\) - \(q_{16\%}\), are the \(16^{\rm th}\) and \(84^{\rm th}\) percentiles of a given distribution.

### Monte Carlo Jet Mass Resolution for \(W/Z\), top, \(H\to b\bar{b}\), and QCD jets

The MC-based JMR is evaluated for the four simulated event samples described in Section 3:

\(W^{\prime}\to WZ\to q\bar{q}q\bar{q}\), \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\), \(G\to HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\), and \(2\to 2\) strong interactions processes, a common background in ATLAS. These samples give rise to large-radius \(W/Z\) jets, top jets, \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets, and QCD jets, respectively. In addition to the basic requirements outlined in Section 5.2, such jets are labelled by ghost-association [37] to a truth-level \(W/Z\), top or \(H\) particle respectively, with the exception of QCD jets, where no matching requirement to a truth particle is imposed.

#### 5.3.1 Monte Carlo JMR Estimate for Large-Radius Jets

The JMR as a function of large-radius jet \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) is shown in \(m^{\rm true}\)/\(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) bins for QCD jets, and \(m^{\rm true}\) bins for \(W/Z\), top and \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets ("signal jets"), for both \(m^{\rm calo}\) and \(m^{\rm comb}\) resolutions, in Figures 1 and 2. For signal jets, \(m^{\rm true}\) bins are used, motivated by the presence of an intrinsic mass scale expectation for such jets. There is no intrinsic mass scale for QCD jets, so the JMR is shown as a function of \(m^{\rm true}\)/\(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\), which is proportional to the angular size of the core energy distribution within the jet. This is a proxy for the particle level angular spread of the decay products produced by the parent particle generating the jet. The JMR behaviour, binned in detector-level quantities, is summarised in Appendix A.

The JMR behaviour as a function of the jet kinematic properties requires additional detailed studies. Here a qualitative description of the possible effects underlying such behaviour is provided.

Binning in \(m^{\rm true}\)/\(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) provides a complete overview of the general JMR behaviour in the QCD jets distribution, where the JMR is largest at low \(m^{\rm true}\)/\(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) values. Fixing this ratio selects jets in which the energy distribution has approximately constant angular spread and increasing energy content as \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) increases. The calorimeter energy resolution is reduced with increasing jet energy and, as the angular resolution contribution is roughly constant, the overall JMR resolution is expected to be reduced as a function of \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) at fixed \(m^{\rm true}\)/\(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\). On the other hand, if instead \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) is fixed, then as \(m^{\rm true}\)/\(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) decreases in size, the angular separation becomes comparable to the finite granularity of the calorimeter, causing the jet mass resolution to degrade. The largest JMR values are observed in the curve corresponding to the smallest \(m^{\rm true}\)/\(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\): here the subjet angular spread becomes comparable in size to a cell in the hadronic calorimeter and the limitations due to the spatial granularity of the detector are more significant.

For \(W/Z\), top and \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets, each JMR curve corresponds to an ensemble of jets with an approximately fixed mass. These span a decreasing angular spread of the decay products as \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) increases. It is therefore expected that the reduction in energy resolution of the calorimeter at higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\) is offset by the increase in angular resolution of the jets. In addition, at a fixed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\), jets with smaller masses are expected to have smaller angular spread and similar energy content to the larger mass jets, thus generally resulting in a larger JMR for a large fraction of the explored \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\) range.

In order to make a quantitative comparison of the MC-based JMR for \(m^{\mathrm{calo}}\) and \(m^{\mathrm{comb}}\), the two different resolutions have been overlaid, as a function of transverse momentum of the truth jet matched to the detector-level jet (see Section 5.2). The JMR for each of the two jet mass definitions is compared in Figure 3, where now large mass windows have been placed on all four sample topologies. In addition to the truth jet matching, the truth jet mass, \(m^{\mathrm{true}}\) is required to be in an interval containing the mass peak corresponding to the reconstructed \(W/Z\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\), or top jets. For the QCD jets, an \(m^{\mathrm{true}}\) interval ranging

Figure 1: The MC-based JMR for \(m^{\mathrm{true}}\) of large-radius jets as a function of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\), for four jet topologies: \(W/Z\) jets, top jets, \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets, and QCD jets. Representative ranges of jet \(m^{\mathrm{true}}\) or \(m^{\mathrm{true}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\) are shown.

Representative ranges of jet \(m^{\rm true}\) or \(m^{\rm true}\)/\(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) are shown.

up to 200 GeV is imposed. For top, \(W/Z\), and \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets there is an absolute 2-7 % improvement in the resolution for \(m^{\rm comb}\), particularly at higher momenta where the jet is more boosted and the \(m^{\rm comb}\) definition relies more upon the tracking information. The \(m^{\rm comb}\) weights are derived using a sample of QCD jets and so, in topologies different from QCD jets, the expected improvement in performance for \(m^{\rm comb}\) can be reduced in the very low \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) regions where the \(m^{\rm calo}\) contribution to \(m^{\rm comb}\) is dominant. This is most evident in the very first \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) bin, for example in the case of \(W/Z\) jets.

Results for four jet topologies are shown: \(W/Z\) jets, top jets, \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets, and QCD jets.

#### 5.3.2 Monte Carlo JMR Estimate for Small-Radius Jets

In Figure 4 the MC-based JMRs of three types of small-radius jets are compared: those reconstructed from EM topoclusters, from PFOs and from LCW topoclusters. As with the comparison of the calorimeter and combined mass JMRs, here a large mass window is taken in each sample. The additional tracking information from PFOs provides a superior resolution across the majority of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\) range, most clearly for the QCD jets where there is up to an absolute 6 % improvement at higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\). The use of PFOs has previously been shown to improve the jet energy resolution at low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\), because there the tracking resolution is superior to the calorimeter jet energy resolution. This feature serves as one of the most important motivations for using particle flow jets, and the improvement in the JMR seen here provides further support for their wider usage. JMR performance of LCW-topocluster-based jets is generally similar to EM-topocluster-based jets.

### Systematic Uncertainties on the Monte Carlo-based Jet Mass Resolution

The MC-based JMR systematic uncertainties result from a multitude of sources encompassing effects from the detector geometry, higher-order corrections in the process of interest, the non-perturbative QCD parton shower and hadronization, and the modeling of the interaction of particles with matter. During Run 1 these were estimated by varying assumptions on each effect separately, re-calculating the JMR for the varied scenarios and quantifying the spread of the observed values. Based on these studies [35] the resulting relative systematic uncertainty on the JMR was estimated to be 20%. This value is also supported by comparisons of Run 1 data with simulations [38]. This 20% is an over-smearing uncertainty, and it is applied directly to the MC-based JMR using the method of Gaussian smearing (see below), in order to account for additional detector effects and mismodelings beyond MC detector-level. Finally the method used to calculate the JMR uncertainty due to the size of the Monte Carlo samples (MC statistical uncertainty) is summarized in Appendix B. The MC statistical uncertainties for large-radius jets are comparable in size for both mass definitions, and are at the percent level in the bulk of the JMR phase-space. At higher transverse momentum and boost, they are slightly larger due to the combination of the falling nature of the involved distributions with the size of the simulated samples. The MC statistical uncertainty is therefore a subdominant contribution compared to the much larger detector and modelling effects, and thus it is not considered further.

To mimic the variation induced by the JMR uncertainty, the JMR is increased by multiplying the jet mass by a random number drawn from a Gaussian distribution. A way to increase the standard deviation of a Gaussian variable by a factor \(\alpha\) is to apply a transformation on the variable that results in a scaled enhancement. This can be applied to the Monte Carlo JMR in the following way:

\[(\alpha\sigma_{\mathrm{MC}})^{2}=\sigma_{\mathrm{MC}}^{2}+(x\sigma_{\mathrm{ MC}})^{2}. \tag{4}\]

For example, for the 20% increase, \(\alpha\) is set to 1.2 and Equation 4 is solved to give \(x\approx 0.66\). The Gaussian random variable used for smearing, \(\mathcal{G}\), is then constructed as a Gaussian distribution of unitary mean and a standard deviation of \(x\sigma_{\mathrm{MC}}\). The smearing transformation is then applied to the jet mass in the following way:Figure 4: The MC-based JMR for \(m^{\rm calo}\) of small-radius jets as a function of truth jet transverse momentum \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) in jet topology-dependent \(m^{\rm true}\) intervals. Results for four jet topologies are shown: \(W/Z\) jets, top jets, \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets, and QCD jets. For each topology three distributions are shown for jets reconstructed from EM topoclusters, PFO objects (Particle Flow) and LCW topoclusters respectively. The black lines indicate the \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) scale with \(2m^{\rm true}\)/(\(R=0.4\)), corresponding to the boundaries where the particle of interest can be reasonably contained within the jet.

\[m^{\rm reco,smeared}=m^{\rm reco}\times\mathcal{G}(1,x\sigma_{\rm MC}). \tag{5}\]

The JMR is then calculated for \(m^{\rm reco,smeared}\). Note that in an analysis the impact of Gaussian smearing would be symmetrized. If the distribution of the response \(\mathcal{R}\) to be smeared is Gaussian, this formalism guarantees that the following condition is satisfied:

\[\sigma^{\rm reco,smeared}_{\rm MC}\equiv\sigma_{\rm MC}(m^{\rm reco,smeared}/m^ {\rm true})=\alpha\sigma_{\rm MC}(m^{\rm reco}/m^{\rm true}) \tag{6}\]

where the JMR \(\sigma_{\rm MC}\) for a given response \(\mathcal{R}\) is defined in Equation 3.

### Investigating non-Gaussian features of the Jet Mass Resolution

The ideal case of a perfectly Gaussian detector response is not realised in reality. In general the jet mass response is affected by non-Gaussian effects, and therefore deviations from \(\alpha\) = 1.2 are expected when comparing the smeared and original resolutions. This leads to a definition of non-Gaussianity that is obtained purely from MC: \(\sigma_{\rm MC}(m^{\rm reco,smeared}/m^{\rm true})/\sigma_{\rm MC}(m^{\rm reco }/m^{\rm true})-(1+s)\), if a \(s\%\) smearing is applied. For a Gaussian detector response, this non-Gaussianity will have a value of 0. Any non-Gaussianities could be inferred by looking at the jet mass response. Example jet mass responses illustrating some non-Gaussian behaviour in QCD jets, and an example of a more Gaussian response in \(W/Z\) jets, are shown in Figure 5. Such response features give rise to the non-Gaussianity shown in Figures 6 and 7 for \(m^{\rm calo}\) and \(m^{\rm comb}\) of large-radius jets, respectively. The non-Gaussianity is obtained relative to the truth-level transverse momentum, selecting a suitable window in truth mass for a given sample topology.

For none of the samples, the ideal smearing of \(\alpha\) = 1.2 is recovered in either mass definition, i.e., a non-zero value of non-Gaussianity is obtained. The combined mass closure appears to be similar to the closure from the calorimeter mass resolution, with some (average) improvements from the combined mass, such as for the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets.

Figure 8 shows the impact of the non-Gaussianity for the four different sample topologies considered for the small-radius jets based on EM topoclusters. Similar levels of non-closure are observed. Differences in non-Gaussianity between small and large-radius jets are expected due to the different jet reconstruction, grooming for large-radius jets, and jet-area pileup correction used for small-radius jets, to name a few effects. At low \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\), the \(b\bar{b}\), top, and \(W/Z\) jets generally have larger statistical uncertainties for small-radius jets.

The results of this section indicate one of the important limitations of using Gaussian smearing to estimate the JMR systematic uncertainty: that the underlying responses are not Gaussian. Section 7 will explore this further, using a JMR based on information from data vs. MC. However, first the idea of forward-folding needs to be presented.

## 6 Jet Mass Resolution from Forward-Folding

Forward-folding measures the JMR scale in data relative to what is expected from Monte Carlo, together with associated systematic uncertainties on that measurement. This information is captured by a set of \(in\)\(situ\)-derived parameters defined below. In the present studies such parameters are then used to correct the Monte Carlo JMR to match data.

In the forward-folding transformation, the detector-level jet mass is modified in the following way (assuming the relative jet mass scale is unity [8]):

\[m_{\mathrm{FF}}^{\mathrm{reco}}=m^{\mathrm{reco}}|(m^{\mathrm{true}},p_{ \mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{calco}})+\Theta\left(m^{\mathrm{reco}}|(m^{\mathrm{true}},p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{calco}})-\langle m^{\mathrm{reco}}|(m^{\mathrm{true}},p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{calco}})\rangle\right) \tag{7}\]

where \(\langle m^{\mathrm{reco}}|(m^{\mathrm{true}},p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{calco}})\rangle\) is the average detector-level jet mass, given a truth mass \(m^{\mathrm{true}}\) and a detector-level \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{calco}}\). The \(\Theta\) parameter is derived from \(in\)\(situ\) studies [8] involving samples enhanced in top jets and \(W\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{calco}}<1.0\) TeV.

For these studies, the forward-folding transformation is applied to large-radius jets in simulated samples of \(W\) and top jets, where the \(\Theta\) depends on the mass and transverse momentum of the jet. To perform the transformation and extract a JMR, information about the jet mass response is required. This is obtained by dividing both terms of Equation 7 by the truth mass, _which is fixed,_ thus obtaining:

\[\mathcal{R}_{\mathrm{FF}}=\mathcal{R}|(m^{\mathrm{true}},p_{\mathrm{T}}^{ \mathrm{calco}})+\Theta\left(\mathcal{R}|(m^{\mathrm{true}},p_{\mathrm{T}}^{ \mathrm{calco}})-\langle\mathcal{R}|(m^{\mathrm{true}},p_{\mathrm{T}}^{ \mathrm{calco}})\rangle\right) \tag{8}\]

Figure 5: The jet mass response for large-radius jets. The calorimeter jet mass definition is used. A Gaussian fit has been overlaid for illustrative purposes. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{calco}}\) bins have been chosen for demonstrative purposes as examples of distributions which are or are not reasonably Gaussian.

The calorimeter jet mass definition is used. A 20.0% Gaussian smearing has been used. The red line gives the mean value, averaged across the points. The green lines provide the standard deviation across the points.

The green lines provide the standard deviation across the points.

Figure 8: The non-Gaussianity, \((\sigma_{\rm MC}^{\rm calo,smeared}{}_{l/\sigma_{\rm MC}^{\rm calo}})-1.2\), for small-radius EM-topocluster-based jets, as a function of truth jet transverse momentum. The calorimeter jet mass definition is used. A 20.0% Gaussian smearing has been used. The red line gives the mean value, averaged across the points. The green lines provide the standard deviation across the points.

where \(\langle\mathcal{R}|(m^{\rm true},p_{\rm T}^{\rm calo})\rangle\) is the average jet mass response, given \(m^{\rm true}\) and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm calo}\). In the forward-folding transformation, the value of \(\Theta\) depends on the mass and on the momentum of the jet. It is more usual to quote the variable \(\kappa\), defined as \(\kappa\equiv 1+\Theta\). The measured values for \(\kappa\), and the associated uncertainties \(\delta\kappa\), are summarised in Table 3. These have been obtained from Figure 16 of Ref. [8].

Consequently, given \(m_{\rm FF}^{\rm reco}\) and \(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF}\), the forward-folding JMR definition is obtained from Equation 3 as:

\[\sigma_{\rm FF}=\frac{IQnR(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF})}{2\times\mathcal{M}( \mathcal{R}_{\rm FF})} \tag{9}\]

where \(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF}\) is parametrised as a function of \(m^{\rm true}\) and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm calo}\).

When \(IQnR(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF})\)/2 coincides with the standard deviation of \(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF}\), here denoted \(\Sigma(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF})\), using the definition of \(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF}\) in Equation 8 allows one to write \(IQnR(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF})/2=\kappa\ \Sigma(\mathcal{R}|(m^{\rm true},p_{\rm T}^{\rm calo}))\). In addition, given that taking the average of Equation 8 results in \(\langle\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF}\rangle=\langle\mathcal{R}|(m^{\rm true},p_{\rm T }^{\rm calo})\rangle\), when \(\mathcal{M}(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF})\) coincides with \(\langle\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF}\rangle\) and \(IQnR(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF})/2\) coincides with \(\Sigma(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF})\), Equation 9 becomes:

\[\sigma_{\rm FF}=\frac{IQnR(\mathcal{R}_{\rm FF})}{2\times\mathcal{M}( \mathcal{R}_{\rm FF})}=\frac{\kappa\Sigma(\mathcal{R}|(m^{\rm true},p_{\rm T }^{\rm calo}))}{\langle\mathcal{R}|(m^{\rm true},p_{\rm T}^{\rm calo})\rangle}. \tag{10}\]

As a consequence Equation 10 provides the following approximation for the forward-folding JMR:

\[\sigma_{\rm FF}=\kappa\sigma(\mathcal{R}|(m^{\rm true},p_{\rm T}^{\rm calo})). \tag{11}\]

This approximation is adopted for \(\sigma_{\rm FF}\) in these studies. In this light it is relevant to emphasize the physical interpretation of the \(\kappa\)-value: it is the \(relative\) JMR, representing the ratio of the forward-folding (data-driven) JMR to the MC-based JMR, and therefore the natural parameter for forward-folding.

The uncertainty on \(\kappa\) is used to derive the corresponding up (+) and down (-) systematic JMR variations \(\sigma_{\rm FF\pm}\) according to :

\[\sigma_{\rm FF\pm}=(\kappa\pm\delta\kappa)\sigma(\mathcal{R}|(m^{\rm true},p_ {\rm T}^{\rm calo})). \tag{12}\]

## 7 JMR comparisons: Gaussian Smearing versus Forward-Folding

With forward-folding defined, two comparisons between it and the purely MC-based, Gaussian smearing can now be made: first the relative JMR magnitudes, and second the relative JMR uncertainties. The comparison of the JMR magnitude for equivalent-sized Gaussian smearing and forward-folding corrections provides a further assessment of the size of non-Gaussian effects on the jet mass reconstruction. The comparison of the relative JMR uncertainties in the two scenarios quantifies the size of their differences.

### Comparing JMR values

In the ideal case of a Gaussian detector response, the ratio of forward-folding to an MC-based JMR modified with Gaussian smearing is expected to yield unity. This property has been confirmed by performing a simulated experiment, in which a Gaussian-distributed random variable is both smeared and forward-folded on an event-by-event basis, and the ratio of the two resulting distributions is consistent with unity.

Given a \(\kappa\) value used in forward-folding, one defines \(\sigma_{\mathrm{MC,corr}}\) to be the MC-based JMR, which has been corrected to the value of the JMR determined \(in\ situ\) from data using forward-folding. This is achieved by applying a Gaussian smearing by \(x\) to the mass such that, assuming a Gaussian detector response, its magnitude is the same as the forward-folding JMR derived using \(\kappa\). Since the JMR in data has a worse resolution than in Monte Carlo, it is necessary to smear the Monte Carlo JMR so that it matches the data. This \(x\) value will be denoted \(x_{\kappa}\) to highlight that it has been calculated to be equivalent to a given \(\kappa\) value assuming a Gaussian distribution. The values of \(\sigma_{\mathrm{FF}}\) and the corresponding \(\sigma_{\mathrm{MC,corr}}\) are referred to as the nominal data-corrected JMR. In forward-folding procedure the \(\kappa\) are a function of jet \(m^{\mathrm{true}}\) and jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\) (see Table 3). Therefore, in order to determine the appropriate equivalent \(x_{\kappa}\)-values, a variable smearing approach is adopted, where the Gaussian smearing also depends on the \(m^{\mathrm{true}}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\) of the jet. This allows for a consistent comparison to be made with the forward-folding. The ratio \(\sigma_{\mathrm{FF}}/\sigma_{\mathrm{MC,corr}}\) then directly tests the initial assumption of a Gaussian detector response necessary to match \(x_{\kappa}\) to \(\kappa\), and therefore deviations from unity quantify the magnitude of the non-Gaussianity in reconstructing the jet mass.

The \(x_{\kappa}\) are calculated by substituting the forward-folding coefficient \(\kappa\) in Equation 11 with the \(\alpha\) coefficient in Equation 6, and by using Equation 4 to derive the corresponding \(x_{\kappa}\)-value. The corresponding uncertainties on \(x_{\kappa}\) are obtained using the same approach, but the \(\kappa\)-value is replaced by its uncertainty, \(\delta\kappa\). The results of this procedure are reported in Table 3. These new \(x_{\kappa}\)-values are then used to construct a Gaussian smearing function where the \(x_{\kappa}\)-value changes as \(\kappa\) changes. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\) ranges considered are different for the two different sample topologies for which the \(\kappa\) parameter is available: \(W\) jets where \(200\GeV<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}<350\GeV\) and top jets where \(350\GeV\leq p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}<1000\GeV\).

The new jet mass- and jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\)-dependent Gaussian smearing scenario is compared with the forward-folding scenario in Figure 9. The magnitude of the ratio is within about 5% percent of unity, thus quantifying the effects from the non-Gaussianity to be at the 5% level.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c c|c c|c c|} \hline Jet \(m^{\mathrm{true}}\) [GeV] & Jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\)[GeV] & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Nominal} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Up-variation} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Down-variation} \\ \hline  & & \(\kappa\) & Equivalent \(x_{\kappa}\) & \(\kappa+\delta x\) & Equivalent \(x_{\kappa}+\delta x_{\kappa}\) & \(\kappa-\delta x\) & Equivalent \(x_{\kappa}-\delta x_{\kappa}\) \\ \hline
50 - 120 & \(200-250\) & 1.32 & 0.86 & 1.48 & 1.09 & 1.16 & 0.59 \\
50 - 120 & \(250-350\) & 1.33 & 0.88 & 1.52 & 1.14 & 1.14 & 0.55 \\

120 - 300 & \(500-1000\) & 1.31 & 0.85 & 1.82 & 1.52 & 0.62 & 0.00 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: The different \(\kappa\)-values considered in the forward-folding procedure, extracted from Figure 16 of Ref. [8]. The two rows are the \(\kappa\) values derived from \(W\) jets, and the bottom two rows are derived from top jets. The corresponding \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\)-values are given. The equivalent \(x_{\kappa}\)-values for a Gaussian smearing, assuming a Gaussian detector response, are also given. In the final row, the \(\kappa-\delta\kappa\) of 0.62 would produce a non-real \(x_{\kappa}-\delta x_{\kappa}\), and so this lower bound is set to 0 (no smearing).

### Comparing JMR Uncertainties

Given the systematic uncertainty on forward-folding JMR defined in Section 6, the up (+) and down (\(-\)) variations of the nominal \(\sigma_{\mathrm{MC,corr}}\), are denoted \(\sigma_{\mathrm{MC,corr+}}\) and \(\sigma_{\mathrm{MC,corr-}}\). These JMRs depend on \(x_{\kappa}+\delta x_{\kappa}\) and \(x_{\kappa}-\delta x_{\kappa}\), respectively. They correspond to an MC-based JMR derived by a Gaussian smearing of \(x_{\kappa}\)\(\pm\)\(\delta x_{\kappa}\), equal to a forward-folding JMR obtained with \(\kappa\)\(\pm\)\(\delta\kappa\), assuming a Gaussian detector response.

The relative size of the propagated JMR systematic uncertainty is then compared by defining two ratios: \(\Delta_{\pm}\), corresponding to the up (+) and down (\(-\)) systematic variations respectively:

\[\Delta_{\pm}=\frac{(\sigma_{\mathrm{FF\pm}}-\sigma_{\mathrm{FF}})/\sigma_{ \mathrm{FF}}}{(\sigma_{\mathrm{MC,corr\pm}}-\sigma_{\mathrm{MC,corr}})/\sigma _{\mathrm{MC,corr}}} \tag{13}\]

Table 4 gives the overview of the "nominal" JMRs and of their systematic uncertainties. The numerator and the denominator of \(\Delta\) measure the difference between the nominal JMR and the JMR including systematic uncertainties ("nominal + uncertainty" - "nominal") for the forward-folding and the corresponding Gaussian smearing approach respectively, normalized by the nominal value.

The values of the \(\Delta_{\pm}\) are shown in Figure 10 and demonstrate that there is a difference between the relative sizes of the two systematic uncertainties propagated in the two approaches. For \(W\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\) < 350, the sizes of the systematic uncertainties associated with forward-folding are consistent with what is observed in the case of the Gaussian smearing. However, for top jets with 350 < \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{true}}\) < 500  the forward-folding systematic uncertainties are consistent with being as much as 20% smaller than the size of the uncertainties associated with Gaussian smearing for for \(\Delta_{+}\). Furthermore, the forward-folding uncertainties are then observed to be up to 40% larger than the Gaussian

The jets are smeared in a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent fashion. The error bars represent the uncertainty due to the finite sample size.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline  & Nominal & Up-variation & Down-variation \\ \hline MC-based JMR & \(\sigma_{\text{MC}}\) & N. A. & N. A. \\ MC-based JMR corrected to data using Gaussian smearing & \(\sigma_{\text{MC,corr}}\) & \(\sigma_{\text{MC,corr+}}\) & \(\sigma_{\text{MC,corr-}}\) \\ Data-corrected (forward-folding) JMR & \(\sigma_{\text{FF}}\) & \(\sigma_{\text{FF+}}\) & \(\sigma_{\text{FF-}}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: The relationship between the different JMR definitions. The nominal JMRs are presented in the first column. The second and third column represent the nominal JMRs which have been modified by additional systematic variations, coming from \(\delta x_{\kappa}\) in the Gaussian smearing approach and \(\delta\kappa\) in the forward-folding approach. Systematic variations are not named (N. A. = Not Applicable) for the nominal MC-based JMR.

Figure 10: The \(\Delta\) ratios for \(W\) and top quark jets. Mass and \(p_{\text{T}}\) windows, as specified on the plots, reflect the mass and \(p_{\text{T}}\) where forward-folding \(\kappa\) parameters have been derived. The jets are smeared in a \(p_{\text{T}}\)-dependent fashion. The up variations are calculated by considering a smearing of \(x_{\kappa}+\delta x_{\kappa}\). The down variations are calculated by considering a smearing of \(x_{\kappa}-\delta x_{\kappa}\). The error bars represent the uncertainty due to the finite sample size. The large difference in the final bin of \(\Delta_{-}\) is due to a large \(\delta\kappa\) and an undersmeared \(x_{\kappa}-\delta x_{\kappa}\) (see Table 3).

smearing uncertainties in \(\Delta_{-}\), for \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) > 500. The explanation behind this sudden jump in the size of the forward-folding uncertainty may have multiple contributions, including differences in the origin of the jet (\(W\) vs. top), as well as the large increase in \(\delta\kappa\) for \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) > 500, as shown in Table 3. There is also an impact from the variable smearing approach itself: the \(x_{\kappa}-\delta x_{\kappa}\) variation for \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm true}\) > 500  requires a Gaussian under-smearing which would not be a real number (i.e. \((x_{\kappa}-\delta x_{\kappa})^{2}<0\)), and therefore no smearing is applied as an approximation. It is therefore reasonable to partially attribute this 40% difference between the two methods to the inability of the Gaussian smearing approach to reduce the JMR. This demonstrates a fundamental advantage of the forward-folding procedure in the treatment of JMR systematic uncertainties. The general differences between forward-folding and Gaussian smearing in \(\Delta_{+}\) of the top jets could be attributed to smearing into the tails of the response itself, resulting in an enhancement of non-Gaussian effects.

## 8 Conclusions

After a brief review of the definition of the Monte Carlo jet mass resolution, the latest ATLAS Run 2 Monte Carlo JMR estimates for large-radius and small-radius jets have been derived for final states containing \(W/Z\), top, \(H\to b\bar{b}\), and QCD jets. The JMR values show a similar behaviour for all topologies. For most of the phase-space, for both small- and large-radius jets, the JMR values are about 10%. JMR values are at the level of 5 to 10% in mass windows around the relevant particle in the three signal topologies. A comparison between the calorimeter and combined masses has also been made, where the combined mass generally features lower JMR values than the calo mass, particularly for the \(W/Z\) and QCD jets.

The MC-based technique of Gaussian smearing is employed to evaluate the magnitude of effects arising from a non-Gaussian detector response. The size of these non-Gaussianities varies between the final state jets and the jet mass definition and can be as large as 10-20%. In other parts of phase-space, the deviation can be within 10% of the central value expected from a 20% smearing.

Next, the method of forward-folding is presented as a means of determining a second JMR, quantifying the difference between data and MC. Finally, the approach of Gaussian smearing is applied to evaluate nominal and systematic variations on the MC JMR in a way that allows this quantity to be compared with the nominal JMR arising from forward-folding, and its respective systematic variations, using top and jets. The relative sizes of the uncertainties in these two approaches is similar at \(p_{\rm T}\) < 500, within the uncertainty due to the sample size. At \(p_{\rm T}\) > 350, where boosted top jets provide a large calibration sample in data, the relative uncertainty from forward-folding varies from being 20% smaller than the corresponding uncertainty from smearing, to up to 40% larger. This 40% difference between the two methods is partially due to the inability of the Gaussian smearing approach to reduce the JMR and thus demonstrates a fundamental advantage of the forward-folding procedure as applied to the treatment of JMR systematic uncertainties.
