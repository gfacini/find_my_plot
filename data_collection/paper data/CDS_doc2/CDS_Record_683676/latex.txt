## 1 Overview of the field

The solenoid which will provide a field for the ATLAS inner detector (ID) volume has a radius of 1.23 m, a half-length of 2.65 m and a current of 9.3 M Ampturns. So it is considerably shorter and fatter than the volume instrumented with tracking detectors which has a radius of 1.05 m and half length of 3.4 m. This mis-match is the result of a deliberate choice to sacrifice some tracking performance at high \(\eta\) in order to improve the calorimeter performance at around \(\eta=1.6\), making the ATLAS solenoid the most non-uniform ever designed for a precision tracker.

The return flux from the solenoid is mostly ( 79% ) [1] carried by the support bars of the tileal which are situated at a radius of about 4 m and have a half length of 6.2 m with a break at \(z=2.8\) m between the barrel and the extended barrel (Figure 1). A significant part ( 13% ) of the return flux is also carried in the iron/glue/scintillator structure of the tileal itself. There is also an iron plate at \(z=6.7\) m but this is so far away that it has only a little influence on the field in the tracking region.

The combined effect of these iron parts is to increase and distort the field relative to that which would be produced by the solenoid coil alone. The contribution of the iron to the total field varies between 3% and 10% over the 1D volume.

## 2 Accuracy requirements

Here we consider the requirements imposed by physics on the accuracy with which we must know the field shape, the field magnitude and the position of the tracker coordinate system relative to the coordinate system in which the field is defined.

### Physics Motivation

There are many examples of physics studies ( H\(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\), H\(\rightarrow\ell\), H\(\rightarrow\)\(b\overline{b}\), SUSY particle three-body decays to leptons or jets...), where the accuracy of the experimental measurement will be dominated by the uncertainty on the overall mass scale. This will be true even at low luminosity. For this reason, the physics we expect to do with ATLAS demands the best possible knowledge of the overall mass scale of the experiment: ambitious targets of 0.1% for electrons and muons and of 1% for hadronic jets have been set at the outcome of recent studies in the context of SUGRA models [3][4]. In these models, many of the SUSY particle masses are directly and sensitively related to some of the fundamental parameters (\(m_{1/2}\), tan\(\beta\)...); as an example, a 0.2% (resp. 1%) measurement of the Higgs boson mass (through its decay into photon pairs) would constrain tan\(\beta\) to 1% (resp. 5%).

We will have to build up a reliable, stable and over-constrained strategy for defining a common mass scale for resonances decaying into any of final states quoted above. It is very hard to define this strategy precisely today, many years before having experimental data in our hands, and it is obviously even harder to estimate the systematic effects we will have to contend with in a quantitative and exhaustive way. However it is clear that as well as being important in itself the ID will be the link by which the electromagnetic, hadronic and muon spectrometer energy scales are cross-calibrated with each other.

ATLAS will obviously record vast numbers of well known resonances such as \(J/\psi\) and \(Z\) which can in principle be used to set the momentum scale, but we should avoid using these to try to tweak the magnetic field map. Many months or years of effort are needed to disentangle the effects of detector misalignment, energy loss in material and magnetic field errors. Furthermore, if resonances were set to their PDG value by definition then we would have nothing left with which to check the calibration and no way of estimating the systematic error.

### Required Accuracy

#### 2.2.1 Magnitude

The discussion above sets our specification that the average value of \(\int B_{z}\times dl\) must be known to 0.1% when all trajectories in a large slice of the tracker acceptance are averaged together. By "large slice" we mean something like a range of one unit of pseudo-rapidity. For example if we reconstruct a heavy resonance mainly in the barrel region and compare its mass with a lighter resonance found mainly in the forward region we will want to know their relative masses to 0.1%.

#### 2.2.2 Shape

By field shape we are referring to errors of the value of \(\int B_{z}\times dl\) over smaller regions of \(\eta,\phi\) space than those mentioned in the previous section. The constraint here comes from the need to use ID momentum measurements

to cross calibrate other parts of the tracker and to measure misalignments within the ID itself. We estimate that errors of at most 0.3% can be tolerated.

#### 2.2.3 Angle between field axis and tracker axis

If there is an unknown angle, \(\delta\), between the true direction of the field and the direction used in the track fit this will result in a systematic bias on some track parameters. A tracking simulation shows that the most sensitive parameter is \(z_{0}\), the \(z\) position of closest approach of the helix to the beam. This is because at certain azimuthal angles the tracks now experience a radial component to the field \(B_{z}\sin\delta\) which bends them slightly in the \(R-z\) plane, whereas the track fit expects a straight line in the \(R-z\) plane causing a systematic bias in the intersection of the fit with the \(z\) axis.

The bias on \(z_{0}\) is largest in the forward region but also exists in the barrel. For 10 GeV tracks \(\sigma_{z_{0}}=110\mu\)m and the bias is 20% or 22 \(\mu\)m when \(\delta=3.1\) mrad. For 2 GeV tracks \(\sigma_{z_{0}}=380\mu\)m and the bias is 20% or 76 \(\mu\)m when \(\delta=2.8\) mrad. If a vertex is formed from a pair of oppositely signed tracks then the effect can be doubled. Since the ID has the potential to make use of \(z\) vertex information in flavour tagging it would be foolish to allow any significant bias so we require \(\delta<1\) mrad.

#### 2.2.4 Tracker-field \(z\) position

Suppose that the centre of the solenoid was displaced in the \(z\) direction by a distance \(t_{z}\) relative to the position assumed by the track fit. The main effect turns out to be a bias on momentum, \(p_{T}\), and transverse impact parameter, \(d_{0}\), in the far forward region. This can be understood because the tracks are entering the low field region at high \(z\) at a different point in their trajectory from that which is expected in the track fit. The fit compensates by adjusting the curvature and \(d_{0}\) slightly to make the best overall \(\chi^{2}\). There is no significant effect in the barrel because it has near-uniform field. In order to keep the bias on \(p_{T}\) scale below 0.1% we need to keep \(t_{z}\) below 2 cm. In this case the \(d_{0}\) bias will be less than 1 micron.

#### 2.2.5 Tracker-field radial position

Suppose that the centre of the solenoid was displaced in the radial direction by a distance \(t_{R}\) relative to the position assumed by the track fit. The main effect turns out to be a bias on momentum, \(p_{T}\), and transverse impact parameter, \(d_{0}\), in the forward regions with the same explanation as in the previous section. In order to keep the bias on \(p_{T}\) scale below 0.1% we need to know \(t_{R}\) to better than 3 mm. In this case the \(d_{0}\) bias will be less than 1 micron.

## 3 2D or 3D?

One important issue to decide is whether our final parameterisation of the field need be three dimensional or whether it can be two dimensional. First of all it is clear that, even if the field has an axis of perfect symmetry, the position

Figure 2: Magnetic field versus Z at a radius of 1 m as predicted by [1]. The points indicate the minimum number of Hall probes which might be needed to map the field.

of this axis relative to the ID coordinate system will not be known _a priori_ to the level that we need: In section 2.5 we found that the uncertainty on \(t_{R}\) must be less than 3 mm whereas [ TECH-NO-030 section 7] states that the solenoid is estimated to have a positioning accuracy of \(\pm 5\) mm in all directions relative to the cryostat centre and may be further displaced by up to 10 mm when the field is switched on. Neither TECH-NO-030 nor the Solenoid TDR quotes a value for the expected angle between the solenoid \(z\) axis and the \(z\) axis of the cryostat, but given the size of expected transverse movements it would not be surprising if this was outside our 1 mrad requirement. So we must expect to measure the position of the solenoid in \(x\) and \(y\), and its tilt relative to the \(z\) axis, but we may rely on construction accuracy and survey to tell us its position in the \(z\) direction. This measurement will best be done with a series of measurements of **B** at several points in \(\phi\) at \(z\approx\pm 3\) m and \(R\approx 1\) m.

Having found the best axis of symmetry, can we expect that **B** will be independent of \(\phi\) around this axis to the level of about 0.1%? Possible effects which may spoil the symmetry are:

* After making about 1175 turns around the solenoid, the current is carried back to the end where it started in a single conductor at \(\phi=90\) deg. This will have a 0.1% effect which can easily be calculated so is not a concern.
* Barrel toroids. The simulation [1] indicates a \(B_{\phi}\) component of about 0.002 T which was originally thought to be due to the barrel toroids. However, it turns out to be present even when the toroids are switched off so it must be an error of the finite element program. Even if this \(B_{\phi}\) value was real it would have negligible influence on track parameters.
* Experts are confident that the end cap toroids will have negligible effect. This has been confirmed by a special run of the simulation ( see section 4.2.2 ).
* Distortion of the solenoid coil from cylindrical symmetry. This is unlikely because the coil will be built to mm level accuracy and when switched on the magnetic pressure will tend to smooth out any irregularities.
* Inhomogeneity of the TileCal. The magnetic susceptibility of the active part of TileCal is sensitive to the size of the glue gap between iron spacers which is difficult to control. The tilecal rails, which carry the majority of the return flux, will also have slight variations in susceptibility from one to the next. It is possible that either of these effects could perturb the ID field at the per mill level. The existing simulation can not be used to check this because it makes use of the 8-fold symmetry of ATLAS to model only one sector of the detector.
* Displacement of Solenoid relative to TileCal. Even if both components have perfect cylindrical symmetry this will be spoilt by the possible mis-placement of the solenoid relative to the tilecal of up to 20 mm [ TECH-NO-030 Table 10]. As above, the existing simulation can not be used to investigate this displacement.

Given that there are many effects which might spoil the \(\phi\) symmetry it would be unwise to assume at this stage that they will all be negligible, so we must assume that a 3D field map is necessary.

Measurement strategies

### Overall scale

Our tight requirement of 0.1% on the overall scale can best be met by having an NMR probe permanently installed inside the tracking volume. This probe will be used to set the initial scale and follow any time dependent effects. Such effects may be caused for example by hysteresis in the iron or by changes in the magnetic contact between the tilecal barrel and extended barrel when the detector is opened and shut. An NMR probe requires a rather uniform field which probably constrains it to be placed somewhere within \(z<30\) cm and \(R<70\) cm.

### Shape

This is the hard part and there are lots of open questions. When measuring field shape it will not be so easy to distinguish between variations ofshape and displacements of the coordinate system from the centre of the solenoid, so here we treat them both under one heading. There are three basic tools available:

#### 4.2.1 Calculation from first principles

Calculation will certainly be used extensively even though other techniques are needed too. The example of H1 [7] shows that, in a simpler situation than ATLAS, the field shape predicted with a 2D calculation was accurate to 0.2%. Calculation will be limited by knowledge of solenoid dimensions and position, and by knowledge of tilecal magnetic properties, so it can not reach the required accuracy.

#### 4.2.2 Mapping machine

One can use a field mapping machine which scans a cylindrical volume with an array of Hall probes. Such a machine already exists at CERN and has been used to measure ALEPH, DELPH and H1 solenoids. It typically takes data over a grid of several thousand points in a few days and give measurements of the three field components at each point to about 0.1% precision, resulting in a map which is better than 0.1% for the Bdl integral. The machine would be placed in the ID cavity when most of ATLAS has been installed but before installation of the ID itself. The magnetically important parts which must be installed are the tilecal barrel and its extension and the iron plate at 6.7 m. In order to decide which magnets must be installed, the simulation [1] was run in three configurations; all magnets on, all on except endcap toroid, all on except barrel toroid.

The difference in the ID field between endcap toroids on and off is at the level of \(10^{-6}\) and is fairly random in sign, probably due to rounding errors in the simulation. Anyway, it is completely negligible so the endcap toroids need not be installed when the field is mapped.

The effect of switching the barrel toroids on is big enough to be seen in the simulation. Figure 3 shows the effect of the barrel toroids multiplied by a factor 1000 and compared with the total field. The main effect of the barrel toroids is to reduce the magnitude of the ID field by about \(2\times 10^{-4}\), with a secondary effect on the shape of the field of order \(1\times 10^{-4}\). This is probably caused by the magnetisation of the outermost parts of TileCal getting close to saturation, which slightly reduces the effectiveness of TileCal as a return yoke for the solenoid, thus reducing the field seen inside the solenoid. Remembering that the field magnitude is anyway monitored by the NMR probe we conclude that the effect of the barrel toroids is negligible so they need not be switched on when the field is mapped.

#### 4.2.3 Fixed array

The measurement can be done with a fixed array of Hall probes which are attached to the ID itself. Conceptually this is the same as the mapping machine except that, since the probes can not be moved it requires a much larger number of them to sample the same space. This technique will be used by the ATLAS muon system to map the toroid field [8].

If this technique was chosen for the ID, Hall cubes should be arranged in a grid over the outer surface of the ID volume. Of course the important question is how many would be needed? At present we can only make a rough estimate: Let us assume that the theoretical calculation gives us a map which is accurate to 1%, then we need to make sufficient measurements to bring the error down to 0.1%.

If the field was known to be 2D then we might use 15 probes to find the position of the field's symmetry axis and a further 35 probes to find a correction to the \(B_{R}\) and \(B_{z}\) components. Perhaps of order 50 probes in total. In fact a 3D map is expected to be necessary which would require reasonable coverage of the whole surface of the ID volume with hundreds of probes. A fair estimate is that \(50^{\frac{2}{3}}=350\) probes would be needed. Another way to arrive at this number is to guess that we might instrument each 30 degree segment of the tracker with a line of 29probes. So the spacing of the probes would be about 30 cm, which looks like a reasonable number of measurements to fit the curve in Figure 2.

The present design of probe for the muon system has three Hall plates mounted perpendicular to each other on a plastic cube of order 1 inch\({}^{3}\). Also included in the cube is some electronics for temperature compensation. If used for the ID, 350 of these cubes would have to be mounted and surveyed with 0.5 mm and 1 mrad precision in the space between the TRT and the cryostat, which is already crowded with services.

## 5 Conclusions

1. A reliable knowledge of the ID magnetic field in three dimensions with overall scale correct to 0.1% and local errors less than 0.3% must be available before ATLAS starts taking data. The magnetic field is one of the few parts of ATLAS which can be calibrated once-and-for-all before taking any data so we want an absolutely reliable map which will later contribute to; calibration and alignment of the ID, calorimeter uniformity and scale, muon energy loss between ID and muon spectrometer, etc.
2. Calculation from first principles will not be sufficiently accurate for our needs.
3. Mapping of the field with a specialised machine is sufficiently accurate and highly reliable ( because of the large number of redundant data points ). It has been done for so many other experiments that it is almost routine. This is the method that we recommend for ATLAS.
4. Measurement of the field with an array of about 350 probes fixed to the surface of the ID is possible in principle but we don't favour this option because: * even if special miniaturised probes were developed for the ID they and their cables would still occupy a significant space in an already crowded area. * we would have to add 350 structurally stable supports for the probes in places where there is at present no requirement for stability ( eg. the squirrel cage ). * even with this number of probes there is not much redundancy, so for example if a situation arose in future where the ID energy scale appeared to conflict with the calorimeter energy scale then one would not know which to believe.
5. The ATLAS experiment will have a lifetime of at least 10 years, and, on this time-scale, one or two months devoted before start-up to carefully measure some of the basic features of the detector does not seem too high a price to pay.
6. Whatever method of field mapping is used we should install a few NMR probes to monitor the overall field scale during the lifetime of the experiment.

## 6 Further Work

Several questions require further work. We should check that the anomalous \(B_{\phi}\) component of the field disappears when a finer grid is used in the simulation. We will have to study with simulation the possible field irregularities mentioned in section 3 to find out which are likely to be dominant. This will enable us to determine the accuracy and number of points which must be recorded by the mapping machine. A strategy for relating the coordinate system of the installed inner tracker to the coordinate system of the mapping machine will have to be defined. Open questions remain about the NMR probe: Can it operated on the end of a cable long enough to site the electronics outside the high radiation region? If not and it needs a pre-amp can the pre-amp be made radiation hard?

The differences are that they have a much larger and more irregular volume to map and their field is dominated by real currents, so the influence of iron is small enough to be safely calculated. They have chosen to use a fixed set of Hall sensors to deduce the positions of the toroid coils and thus calculate the field with Biot-Savart for the currents plus small corrections from the iron. The total number of probes used will be in the thousands.
