## 1 Introduction

The identification of Higgs bosons decaying to pairs of bottom quarks is an important part of the physics program at the Large Hadron Collider [1] and the ATLAS experiment [2]. Many Beyond the Standard Model scenarios introduce new heavy resonances which can decay to Higgs bosons with high transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) [3; 4; 5; 6; 7]. Dedicated reconstruction techniques for boosted Higgs boson decays in which the two \(b\)-quarks are highly collimated are therefore crucial for improving the sensitivity to these searches. These techniques can also play a role in precise differential measurements of Higgs boson production at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)[8; 9].

The ATLAS results referenced in the previous paragraph share a common \(H\to b\bar{b}\) identification recipe [10]. Large radius (large-\(R\)) jets are reconstructed with the intention of capturing the entire Higgs boson decay, while smaller radius jets (subjets) are used to resolve and identify the individual \(b\)-hadrons. The subjets are \(b\)-tagged with multivariate algorithms exploiting multiple features of the b-hadron decays that are trained and optimized in \(b\)-hadron-enriched data and simulated samples [11; 12]. Several subjet definitions are available and have been extensively studied and documented in Ref. [13]. This note focuses on variable-radius track-jets as subjets, and extends the application of \(b\)-tagging at the large-\(R\) jet level by defining a new tagging algorithm optimized specifically for the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) topology that combines the flavor information of up to three subjets within the large-\(R\) jet. For this purpose, a neural network (NN) for \(H\to b\bar{b}\) tagging is introduced, taking advantage of the strong tagging performance for individual subjets and their discriminant correlations, together with the knowledge of the large-\(R\) jet kinematics.

This note is organized as follows: Section 2 describes the definitions of the jets and other objects used in the NN-based \(H\to b\bar{b}\) tagging algorithm. Section 3 details the simulated event samples used and the algorithm is described in Section 4. Its performance is studied in simulated jets and compared to the individual subjet \(b\)-tagging algorithms, as presented in Section 5. Conclusions are presented in Section 6.

## 2 Object Reconstruction and Selection

The \(H\to b\bar{b}\) candidate decay products are clustered into a large-\(R\) calorimeter jet using an anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) algorithm [14] with \(R=1.0\) and using topological clusters with noise suppression as inputs [15]. To minimize contamination from pile-up and the underlying event, the large-\(R\) jet is groomed using the trimming algorithm [16]. In this procedure, the calorimeter constituents of the jet are reclustered with a \(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) algorithm with \(R=0.2\), forming subjets which are discarded if their \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is less than \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}=5\%\) of the initial large-\(R\) jet. A correction is applied to the large-\(R\) jet energy and mass to account for mismodelling in simulation [17]. The resulting trimmed large-\(R\) jet is saved for further analysis if it satisfies the following conditions: \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<3000\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.0\).

The \(b\)-jets originating from the Higgs candidate decay are reconstructed using inner detector tracks, clustered with the variable-radius (VR) anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) algorithm [18]. In contrast with fixed-radius (FR) jet algorithms, the \(R\) parameter in VR jets is modified to be dependent on the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and a constant parameter \(\rho\), scaling as \(\rho/p_{\mathrm{T}}\). As described in Ref. [13], a value of \(\rho=30\,\mathrm{GeV}\) is chosen to maximize the matching efficiency between the \(b\)-hadron direction and the jet axis. Minimum and maximum values for the radius parameter are also defined as \(R_{\mathrm{min}}=0.02\) and \(R_{\mathrm{max}}=0.4\), outside of which the jet's radius stays fixed to avoid jets with an arbitrary small or large radius parameter. The VR track-jets are ghost-associated [19] to the large-\(R\) jets and required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>7\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(|\eta|<2.5\) and at least two track constituents.

Tracks used to build VR track-jets are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>500\,\mathrm{MeV}\), \(|\eta|<2.5\), and at least seven hits in the pixel and SCT detectors. A maximum of one (two) of the expected hit(s) may be missing from the pixel (SCT) detector, and no more than one hit may be shared with other tracks. After the jets are reconstructed, the various \(b\)-tagging algorithms use track selection which differs from that listed above [20]. These tracks are then matched to the VR track-jets based on their angular separation \(\Delta R\).1 The threshold varies with jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)[21] such that the association cone is wider for softer jets and is increasingly narrow for higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets.

Footnote 1: Tracks are matched to jets for \(b\)-tagging if \(\Delta R(\mathrm{jet},\mathrm{track})<0.239+\exp(-1.22-1.64\times 10^{-5}p_{ \mathrm{T}}/\mathrm{MeV})\), where \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) refers to the jet transverse momentum. The matching is exclusive: a track is only matched to a jet if that jet is the closest in \(\Delta R\).

When defining the flavor of a jet, the following labelling scheme is used, based on the angular proximity between the four-momentum of the hadrons in the event and the jet axis: a jet within \(\Delta R<0.3\) of a \(b\)-hadron is labeled as a \(b\)-jet; if a \(c\)-hadron is found within \(\Delta R<0.3\) but a \(b\)-hadron isn't, the jet is labelled as a \(c\)-jet; if no \(b\) or \(c\)-hadron is found, the jet is labelled as light (\(l\)).

## 3 Simulated Event Samples

The studies presented in this note use simulated jets originating from different processes in proton-proton collisions at \(13\,\mathrm{TeV}\). The sample definitions are similar to those used in earlier ATLAS results focusing on similar topologies [13].

Jets from \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decays (signal jets) originate from samples of Randall-Sundrum (RS) gravitons (\(G^{*}\)) [22] that decay to two Higgs bosons, each of which subsequently decays to a pair of bottom quarks. Events are generated at leading order with MadGraph5[23] interfaced with Pythia 8.186 [24], the ATLAS A14 tune [25] and the NNPDF2.3 LO parton distribution function (PDF) [26].

Two categories of background are considered: jets arising from multijet interactions, and jets from processes resulting in high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) top quarks (top quark jets) through \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) production. Both processes are generated using Pythia 8.186 with the ATLAS A14 tune and the NNPDF2.3 LO PDF.

To optimize discrimination over a wide range of large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), multiple Monte Carlo samples are used. The multijet process is simulated in windows based on the particle-level jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), in order to ensure that a sufficient number of events is available up to very high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) regimes. The top quark jets are generated for a range of \(Z^{\prime}\) invariant masses, from \(750\,\mathrm{GeV}\) to \(5\,\mathrm{TeV}\). The RS graviton samples producing \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets are generated for graviton masses between \(300\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(6\,\mathrm{TeV}\); in these samples the Higgs boson is forced to decay only into a \(b\)-quark pair. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution of the multijet background jets, which is used to evaluate the algorithm performance in Section 5, is shown in Figure 1.

All samples are processed through the full simulation of the ATLAS detector [27; 28]. The modelling of the decays of bottom and charm hadrons is provided by the evtgen[29] package. The effect of multiple proton-proton interactions per bunch crossing (pile-up) is included by overlaying additional collisions generated using Pythia 8 on the hard-scatter events from the signal process, multijets and \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\).

## 4 Double \(b\)-tagging algorithm

The goal of a double \(b\)-tagging algorithm is to identify \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decays on a (large-\(R\)) jet-by-jet basis, using information from the large-\(R\) jet and associated VR track-jets. VR track-jets containing single \(b\)-hadronsare identified with track and secondary vertex features, which are constructed by algorithms known as low-level taggers. These taggers are described in detail elsewhere [11]. The most discriminating taggers are high-level algorithms that combine the outputs of the low-level taggers. Two different implementations are used in ATLAS, one using a boosted decision tree (MV2) and another using a deep neural network (DL1r) [11]. Unlike MV2, which was optimized for \(R=0.4\) jets built from topological clusters, DL1r benefits from a dedicated optimization for VR track-jets [30]. In this note, both MV2 and DL1r algorithms will be used as benchmarks when studying the double \(b\)-tagging performance.

The baseline double \(b\)-tagging method requires two subjets within a large-\(R\) jet, each with a \(b\)-tagging discriminant over some threshold. To take full advantage of the information in the large-\(R\) jet, this note introduces an algorithm which combines the outputs from the high-level single-\(b\) tagging algorithms with a neural network. For the purpose of training the algorithm, each selected large-\(R\) jet in the signal sample is required to have a ghost-associated truth Higgs boson, while no truth matching requirement is placed on the VR track-jets. To test the algorithm performance, all requirements described in Section 2 are imposed, as well as a requirement for the jet mass to be between \(76\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and \(146\,\mathrm{GeV}\). In previous studies, this mass window corresponded to a 90% selection efficiency for Higgs bosons in jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>250\,\mathrm{GeV}\)[31].

With these selection criteria applied, approximately 92% of the resulting sample of large-\(R\) signal jets have at least two track-jets labelled as \(b\)-jets (\(bb\)). Within the multijet sample, about 80% of jets have no matched \(b\)- or \(c\)-hadrons (\(ll\)), while top quark jets are dominated by the single \(b\) categories. In terms of multiplicity, over 99% of Higgs and top jets and 97.5% of jets in multijet events have at least two subjets. Table 1 gives a breakdown of large-\(R\) jet composition for all three analysis samples by subjet flavor and multiplicity fraction.

The algorithm presented here for double \(b\)-tagging combines large-\(R\) jet kinematics with flavor tagging information. Flavor tagging information is supplied by the DL1r algorithm, which outputs three values corresponding to the probabilities for the jet to be a \(b\)-, \(c\)-, or light-jet. Discriminants from up to three leading VR track-jets are passed to the double \(b\)-tagging algorithm. In addition to this \(b\)-tagging information, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) of the large-\(R\) jets are used, for up to eleven input variables for each jet. For training, distributions of the transverse momentum of the large-\(R\) jets are downsampled, in that jets are removed until the shape of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution matches for all processes. This procedure prevents the model from learning the different

kinematic properties of the jets. To avoid the introduction of jet weights in the training, the downsampling targets a distribution in which the total number of jets in each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin is equal to the minimum number of unweighted jets in that \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin across all processes.

The model used for double \(b\)-tagging is a feed-forward neural network, with six fully connected 250 dimensional hidden layers and rectified linear unit activation functions [32]. If there are fewer than three associated subjets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>7\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the inputs corresponding to any missing subjets are replaced with the mean input values. Batch normalization is inserted between hidden layers to stabilize training [33]. A final softmax layer is used to assign probabilities to each class, giving three outputs corresponding to the probabilities for Higgs (\(p_{\mathrm{Higgs}}\)), multijet (\(p_{\mathrm{multijet}}\)) and top (\(p_{\mathrm{top}}\)) processes. The model was trained using the stochastic gradient descent and the Adam optimizer [34] in keras[35] with the tensorflow[36] backend. Training data was fed in batches of 10,000 jets, and parameters updated with an initial learning rate of 0.01, which was reduced by \(10^{-5}\) after each batch. The model was trained for 200 epochs. To mitigate overtraining, the data used in training is not used for evaluation. Within ATLAS reconstruction the model is implemented in lwtnn[37].

## 5 Performance

The performance of the new algorithm is evaluated in terms its efficiency (\(\varepsilon\)) for \(H\to b\bar{b}\) tagging, defined as the number of tagged jets divided by the total number of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets in the region defined in Section 4, along with the corresponding background rejection (\(1/\varepsilon\)), considering either top or multijet processes as backgrounds. The three-class output can be combined into a single discriminant roughly corresponding to a log-likelihood ratio, defined as follows:

\[D_{\mathrm{Xbb}}=\ln\frac{p_{\mathrm{Higgs}}}{f_{\mathrm{top}}\cdot p_{ \mathrm{top}}+(1-f_{\mathrm{top}})\cdot p_{\mathrm{multijet}}} \tag{1}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c|} \hline Category & Multijet & Top & Higgs \\ \hline \(\geq 2b\) & 0.022 & 0.019 & 0.922 \\ \(1b+\geq 1c\) & 0.005 & 0.221 & 0.007 \\ \(1b+\,0c\) & 0.039 & 0.481 & 0.070 \\ \(0b+\,2c\) & 0.036 & 0.007 & - \\ \(0b+\,1c\) & 0.098 & 0.109 & - \\ \(0b+\,0c\) & 0.801 & 0.162 & 0.001 \\ \hline = 1 subjet & 0.025 & 0.009 & 0.005 \\ = 2 subjets & 0.469 & 0.463 & 0.585 \\ \(\geq 3\) subjets & 0.505 & 0.528 & 0.410 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Fractional composition of large-\(R\) jets in analysis samples, broken down by flavor combination and the number of subjets. All selection criteria in Section 2 are applied, in addition to the Higgs mass window. Flavor contributions are given as the fractions of large-\(R\) jets that have at least two subjets. Categories without a numerical entry are negligible. In the Higgs category, only the events originating from the decay of the Higgs boson into bottom quark pairs are considered.

where \(f_{\rm top}\) determines the fraction of top background, set to \(f_{\rm top}=0.25\) for the studies presented here. Variations of the discriminant definition in Equation 1 can be tuned to select any of the three large-\(R\) jet species in various proportions.

Figure 2 shows the \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) discriminant calculated for jets in the Higgs, top and multijet samples. For comparison, Figure 2 also shows the discrimination obtained by directly using the DL1r outputs of the subjets. The double \(b\)-tag requirement is fulfilled when the minimum DL1r discriminant value for the two highest \(p_{\rm T}\) subjets is above a given threshold. The strategy of considering only the two highest \(p_{\rm T}\) subjets reflects what has been adopted in the recent ATLAS \(H\to b\bar{b}\) measurements and searches discussed in Section 1.

The \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) performance is evaluated on samples with the selection criteria from Section 2 imposed, as well as the Higgs mass requirement defined in Section 4. Both the Higgs and top samples are reweighted such that their jet \(p_{\rm T}\) distribution matches the multijet \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum as shown in Figure 1.

Jets are considered tagged when either \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) or the minimum of the two subjet discriminants (for MV2 or DL1r) is above some fixed threshold. Figure 3 shows the signal efficiency and corresponding background rejection for a wide range of possible values of this threshold, evaluated for either multijet or top jet backgrounds. To emphasize cases where boosted tagging techniques are important, jets are required to have \(p_{\rm T}>500\) in this comparison. For the full range of signal efficiencies, \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) achieves an equal or higher multijet and top jet background rejection when compared to an MV2 or DL1r double \(b\)-tag. Specifically, the multijet (top jet) rejection for \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) at 60% efficiency is 92 (31), 1.4 (2.0) times that of an MV2 double \(b\)-tag. The multijet rejection for DL1r at 60% efficiency is approximately equal to that for \(D_{\rm Xbb}\), while the DL1r top jet rejection of 19 is lower than that of \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) by a factor of approximately 0.6.

The improvements of \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) become more significant as the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) increases, where the decay product subjets of the boosted Higgs or top are more likely to be fully contained within the \(R=1.0\) jet. This improvement is illustrated in Figure 4, which shows the relative improvement of background rejection of \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) over the MV2 algorithm as a function of the minimum large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(H\to b\bar{b}\) tagging efficiency. In both Figures 3 and 4, the tagger performance is heavily influenced by the performance of jets near the lower \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold, due to the falling \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum shown in Figure 1.

Figure 4: Relative improvement in multijet rejection (left) and top jet rejection (right) as a function of the minimum large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) tagging efficiency. The baseline algorithm is the minimum MV2 score for the two leading variable-radius track-jets, while the new algorithm is \(D_{\mathrm{Xbb}}\) with a top fraction \(f_{\mathrm{top}}=0.25\). The efficiency and rejection are calculated with respect to jets that passed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(\eta\) and mass preselection requirements.

Figure 3: Multijet (left) and top jet (right) rejection as a function of the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) tagging efficiency, for large-\(R\) (\(R=1.0\)) jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>500\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Performance of the \(D_{\mathrm{Xbb}}\) algorithm is compared to DL1r and to two variants of MV2, one evaluated on variable-radius (VR, \(\rho=30\,\mathrm{GeV}\)) jets, the other on fixed-radius (FR, \(R=0.2\)) jets. The efficiency and rejection are calculated with respect to jets that passed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(\eta\), and mass preselection requirements.

The \(p_{\rm T}\) dependence of the various taggers is further illustrated in Figure 5, which shows the rejection of multijet and top jet backgrounds with the tagging threshold adjusted to 60% Higgs efficiency in each \(p_{\rm T}\) bin. Across the majority of the \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) rejects more multijet and top jets than DL1r, which in turn rejects more of both jet flavors than MV2. All three algorithms lose discrimination power for jets with higher \(p_{\rm T}\). This sensitivity loss is more pronounced for MV2 (due to its lack of a designated training with track-jets) and for \(R=0.2\) jets, which lose the ability to resolve multiple \(b\)-hadrons in highly boosted \(H\to bb\) decays.

Since the \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) algorithm was not trained on features that are strongly correlated with large-\(R\) jet mass, such as jet substructure variables, the correlation of \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) and mass is expected to be small. Figure 6 shows the shape of the large-\(R\) jet mass distribution, before and after a selection on \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) on the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and multijet samples. In this case, a single tagging threshold is chosen to give a 60% \(H\to b\bar{b}\) tagging efficiency on all jets with \(p_{\rm T}>250\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The impact of \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) tagging on the large-\(R\) jet mass distribution for the background is found to be less than 20%.

## 6 Conclusions

This note presents a double \(b\)-tagging algorithm to select boosted Higgs bosons which builds upon the optimized \(b\)-tagging techniques for VR track-jets. Subjects are assigned DL1r \(b\)-, \(c\)-, and light-flavor probabilities, as these offer greater discrimination between jet flavors than MV2. The DL1r probabilities for the three leading subjets, along with the large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\), are passed to a neural network which is trained to distinguish Higgs signals from multijet and top backgrounds. Outputs of this neural network are combined into a discriminant \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) which is used to classify \(R=1.0\) jets. When compared to double b-tagging algorithms used by ATLAS in Run 2, \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) improves discrimination against top and multijet backgrounds. Relative to a double MV2 tag, the multijet (top) rejection at 60% efficiency is increased

Figure 5: Multijet (left) and top (right) jet rejection as a function of large-\(R\) jet \(p_{\rm T}\) with a constant 60% Higgs tagging efficiency. Error bars correspond to the statistical uncertainty. Fixed-radius track-jets with \(R=0.2\) begin to lose discriminating power when \(p_{\rm T}\gtrsim 800\,\mathrm{GeV}\), since subjets begin to merge and resolving two independent \(b\)-jets becomes difficult. Variable-radius track-jets, by contrast, can resolve multiple subjets in boosted objects with \(p_{\rm T}\gg 1\,\mathrm{TeV}\). The efficiency and rejection are calculated with respect to jets that passed \(p_{\rm T}\), \(\eta\), and mass preselection requirements.

by a factor of 1.4 (2.0) for jets with \(p_{\rm T}>500\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Further improvement in multijet or top rejection can be achieved by tuning the \(f_{\rm top}\) value in the \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) definition. Considering the same jets, the improvement is still substantial when comparing to a double DL1r tag: the multijet rejection is roughly equal, while top rejection is improved by a factor of 1.7. Furthermore, the \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) discriminant offers these performance increases over DL1r without significantly worsening the impact on the shape of the jet mass distribution.

Table 4: Fractional composition of large-\(R\) jets in analysis samples broken down by flavor combination, after a selection on \(D_{\rm Xbb}\) corresponding to a fixed 60% efficiency. All selection criteria in Section 2 are applied, in addition to the Higgs mass window. Flavor contributions are given as fractions of large-\(R\) jets that have at least two subjets if two flavors are specified, or at least three subjets if three flavors are specified. The order of flavors listed corresponds to the flavors of subjets in decreasing \(p_{\rm T}\) order. Categories without a numerical entry are negligible.
