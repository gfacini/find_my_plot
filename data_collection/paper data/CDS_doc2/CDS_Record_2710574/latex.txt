# Identification of very-low transverse momentum muons in the ATLAS experiment

The ATLAS Collaboration

The standard muon identification in the ATLAS experiment is optimized for muons with transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) above 5 GeV. However searches for low mass resonances and many B-physics studies often need to identify muons with lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), where standard algorithms suffer from large backgrounds originating from sources such as hadron decays in flight. A new _LowPt_ selection has been developed to allow optimal muon identification down to 3 GeV in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) using variables that are sensitive to track kinks in the inner detector and to the imbalance between momentum measured in the inner detector and in the muon spectrometer. The new _LowPt_ identification, analyzed in simulation and in data, shows good efficiencies for muons produced in hard collisions and is effective in rejecting backgrounds.

## 1 Introduction

The identification of low transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) leptons is a crucial aspect of any B-physics measurement or search for low-mass resonances in the ATLAS experiment [1]. High purity and good momentum resolution can be obtained, with the ATLAS detector, for muon tracks reconstructed in both the inner-detector (ID) and in up to three or four stations of monitored drift tube chambers in the muon spectrometer (MS), allowing for a combined reconstruction (CB) for muons with \(|\eta|<2.5\)[2]. This is however challenging for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<5\) GeV muon tracks because of the sizable amount of energy lost in the calorimeter system before reaching the MS. The _LowPt_ identification working-point (_LowPt_ WP) has been developed in order to obtain optimal muon identification down to a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) = 3 GeV.

This note is organised as follows. The data and simulated samples used in this work are described in Section 2. A set of key variables used in _LowPt_ WP are described in Section 3. The details of the selection requirements used for the _LowPt_ WP and its performance in data and simulation are described in Section 4. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 5.

## 2 Data and Simulated Event Samples

The efficiency measurements presented here are obtained from the analysis of 33.0 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data recorded at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV at the LHC in 2016. Events used to measure the muon reconstruction effeciency relative to ID tracks or calorimeter-tagged muons are mainly selected using a combination of single-muon triggers and triggers requiring one muon with transverse momentum of at least 4 GeV and an ID track such that the invariant mass of the muon+track pair is compatible with the mass of the \(J/\psi\).

Monte Carlo simulated samples for the \(t\overline{t}\) process are generated using Powheg-Box 2[3] interfaced to Pythia 8[4]. Samples of prompt \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays are generated using Pythia8 complemented with PHOTOS++[5] to simulate the effect of final state radiation.

All generated samples are passed through the simulation of the ATLAS detector based on GEANT4 [6; 7] and are reconstructed with the same programs used for the data. The ID and the MS were simulated with an ideal geometry without any misalignment.

The effect of multiple proton-proton interactions in each bunch crossing ("pile-up") is modelled by overlaying simulated minimum-bias events onto the original hard-scattering event. Monte Carlo events are then reweighted so that the distribution of the average number of interactions per event agrees with the data.

## 3 Key Variables for Optimal Identification of Low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) Muons

Three variables with good discrimination power between the reconstruction of prompt muon tracks and mis-identified hadron tracks (fakes) have been investigated.

Momentum balance significance (MBS) is defined as \(\mathrm{MBS}=(p_{ID}-p_{MS}-E_{loss})/\sigma(E_{loss})\), where \(p_{ID}\) and \(p_{MS}\) are respectively the momentum measured in the Inner Detector (ID) and in the Muon Spectrometer (MS), \(E_{loss}\) is the energy lost measured in the calorimeter system, and \(\sigma(E_{loss})\) is the uncertainty sigma on \(E_{loss}\). For muons with no momentum measured in the MS, MBS is set to 0.

The scattering neighbor significance (SNS) is a variable estimating the significance of a change in trajectory (kink) along the track, expected in the presence of a hadron decaying to a muon. The SNS is defined as the largest value of scattering angle significances over the entire track. Scattering angle significance is computed considering pairs of adjacent hits along the track, and evaluated as the significance of the angular distance in the bending plane between the two half tracks ending/starting at each of the hits.

The scattering curvature significance (SCS) is computed as the change of the normalized integral of the scattering angle significances in the track bending plane, senstive to large kinks along the trajectory. It is a variable used to capture the presence of a significant discontinuity in the track direction, which is a characteristic of in-flight hadron decays.

Figure 1 shows the distributions of the described variables for prompt muons and for fakes in simulated events.

## 4 _LowPt_ Identification Working Point Definition and Performance

For the _LowPt_ WP, only CB tracks are used. For \(|\eta|<1.3\), at least one MS station is required; for \(1.3<|\eta|<1.55\), at least two MS stations are required; for \(|\eta|>1.55\), the _Medium_ WP [2] requirements are applied. Moreover, a very loose selection on the variables described in Section 3 is used to suppress fakes: \(|\text{MBS}|<3.0\), \(|\text{SNS}|<3.0\) and \(|\text{SCS}|<3.0\).

The expected probabilities for muons and fakes to satisfy the _LowPt_ WP are shown in Figure 2(a) in simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events as a function of the track \(\eta\). Compared with the _Medium_ WP, the _LowPt_ WP recovers more than 20% efficiency for muon in the barrel region at a cost of moderately increased misidentification probability (fake rate), and suppresses fake rate in end-cap region with a few percent loss of efficiency.

Muon reconstruction efficiencies are measured using a tag-and-probe method [2] for \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays. In Figure 2(b), results obtained for the _LowPt_ WP are found to be in excellent agreement with the prediction of the detector simulation. The ratio between efficiencies obtained in collision data and simulation is defined as the efficiency scale factor. The available statistics are the dominant source of uncertainties at low \(p_{\text{T}}\), and dedicated triggers can be used to reduce the statistical uncertainties.

## 5 Conclusion

A new set of identification criteria, the _LowPt_ WP, has been developed. It allows for a muon selection efficiency of about 90% for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) below 5 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) with an expected hadron misidentification probability below 0.5%. The efficiency measurement has been extended down to 3 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) with good agreement between data and simulation.
