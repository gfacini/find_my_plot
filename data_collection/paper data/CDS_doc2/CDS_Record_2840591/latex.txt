## 1 Top-quark pair cross-section measurements

### All channels - ATLAS only

Figure 2: Summary of ATLAS measurements of the top-pair production cross-section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy compared to the NNLO QCD calculation complemented with NNLL resummation (top++2.0). The theory band represents uncertainties due to renormalisation and factorisation scales, parton density functions and the strong coupling. The measurements and the theory calculation are quoted at \(m_{t}=172.5\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{GeV}\). Measurements made at the same centre-of-mass energy are slightly offset for clarity. With respect to the June 2022 note the \(t\bar{t}\) 13 TeV result using full Run2 luminosity was included.
