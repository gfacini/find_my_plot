###### Abstract

The role and performance of various layers (steel, cast iron (CI), concrete, lead, borated polyethylene (BPE), lithium filled polyethylene (LiPE)) and their combinations as shielding against neutrons and photons in the ATLAS experiment forward region (JF shielding) has been studied by means of Monte-Carlo simulations. These simulations permitted one to determine the locations of appearance and disappearance of neutrons and photons and their number at this location. In particular, the determination of the number of newly born neutrons and photons, the number of stopped neutrons and photons, as well as the number of neutrons and photons crossing the borders of shielding layers allowed the assessment of the efficiency of the JF shielding. It provided a basis for comparing the merits of different configurations of shielding layers. The simulation code is based on GEANT, FLUKA, MICAP and GAMLIB. The results of the study give strong support to a segmented shielding made of five layers (steel, CI, BPE, steel, LiPE).

The motivation for and first concept of a shielding solution for the ATLAS experiment forward region have been described in [1]. First studies of the efficiencies of various possible shielding concepts are based on simulations reported in [2] and further developed by other authors (e.g. [3]). The results presented in this article follow experimental [4], physical [5], technological [6] and Monte-Carlo [7] work devoted to an optimisation of the JF shielding for the ATLAS experiment. The simulation codes GEANT [8], FLUKA [9, 10], GHEISHA [11] and MICAP [12] were used for the calculations. In particular, the contribution of photons produced by neutron capture and inelastic scattering of neutrons was calculated using the GAMLIB library [13]. The correctness of the simulation codes used to describe the generation and interaction of neutrons and photons in the shielding materials was proven by the comparison [7] of simulation results with the experimental data [4] obtained from a benchmark experiment.

## 2 Configurations and materials in the JF shielding, description of calculated histograms

The Monte-Carlo simulations were performed for eleven different configurations of the JF shielding, which are listed below with their layer content and thickness. The JF shielding volume and shape were fixed for all the configurations under study.

1) steel1 + ductile iron (D1I, appr. 50 cm) + LiPE (25 cm) + lead (5 cm)

2) steel1 + DI1 (appr. 50 cm) + DI2 (25 cm) + DI3 (5 cm)

3) steel1 + DI1 (appr. 50 cm) + BPE (25 cm) + steel3 (5 cm)

4) steel1 + DI1 (appr. 45 cm) + BPE (25 cm) + steel3 (5 cm) + LiPE (5 cm)

5) only concrete

6) steel1 + concrete1 (appr. 50 cm) + concrete2 (25 cm)+ concrete3 (5 cm)

7) steel1 + concrete1 (appr. 45 cm)+ BPE (25 cm)+ steel3 (5 cm)+ LiPE (5 cm)

8) steel1 + DI1 (appr. 42 cm) + BPE (25 cm) + steel3 (8 cm) + LiPE (5 cm)

9) steel1 + DI1 (appr. 45 cm) + BPE (20 cm) + steel3 (10 cm) + LiPE (5 cm)

10) steel1 + DI1 (appr. 45 cm) + BPE (10 cm) + steel3 (20 cm) + LiPE (5 cm)

11) steel1 + steel2 (appr. 45 cm) + BPE (20 cm) + steel3 (10 cm) + LiPE (5 cm).

In the tables and figures presented in this work, the layers were labeled by numbers: steel1 - 1; DI1 or concrete1 or steel2 - 2; LiPE or BPE or DI2 or concrete2 - 3; lead or steel3 or DI3 or concrete3 - 4; outer LiPE - 5. The JF shielding was divided into 6 regions labeled as A,B,C,D,E,F along the Z direction (Fig. 1).

In order to understand the efficiency of a huge system such as the JF shielding with various shielding configurations, it was necessary to generate many spectra and scatter plots. First of all, scatter plots (radial distribution, R, as a function of the Z direction) were calculated for born and stopped neutrons and photons in the JF shielding. They show the effectiveness of various layers with respect their capability to stop particles without generating additional particles. Further information was obtained from the comparison of simulated spectra of neutrons and photons crossing borders between different layers, outwards and inwards along radial directions. Neutron and photon energies were subdivided into several ranges: 0-10 keV, 10-100 keV, 100-1000 keV, 1-10 MeV, 10-100 MeV and a total range 0-10 GeV, for neutrons; 10-100 keV, 100-1000 keV, 1-10 MeV and 10-100 MeV for photons. All the results presented were obtained for 1000 proton-proton interactions taken from an event file (dtu_7x7.eve), which was generated by the proton-proton event generator DTUJET93 [14].

The knowledge of the location where the neutron terminates its life is important for the understanding of the neutron shielding functionality. This information is also important to assess the need for additional gamma-shielding. During the Monte-Carlo simulations, the information was recorded about the positions where neutrons as well as photons were born or disappeared due to neutron reactions, predominantly radiative capture, allowing the characterization of the effectiveness and functionality of the shielding layers. The positions were saved in 2-dimensional scatter plots (R as a function of Z). Most of the figures show the results for the first ten configurations. Configuration 11 is similar to 9 and gives information about the influence on neutrons of ductile iron if used instead of steel as the second layer. Ductile iron slows down neutrons more effectively than steel due to the higher content of carbon.

The results obtained for born neutrons are shown in Fig. 2. The number of neutrons born in the JF shielding is approximately the same for all configurations with the exception of 2 and 5. For these configurations there is a 22% increase in the number of born neutrons. However, the number of born neutrons is negligible compared to the number of stopped neutrons (Fig. 3). For example, the ratio of born to stopped neutrons is about 0.05 for configuration 4.

As generally accepted, configurations leading to a higher number of stopped neutrons are also configurations offering better shielding capability. Configuration 5 was chosen as a reference for comparison of the number of neutrons stopped in the various configurations. Relative to this reference, other configurations show an increase of the number of stopped neutrons (1 - 112.7%, 2 - 134.9%, 3 - 111.9%, 4 - 111.9%, 6 - 114.6%, 7 - 113.7%, 8 - 112.8%, 9 - 111.0%, 10 - 113.3%). The largest number of stopped neutrons was found in the shielding region E (Fig. 1) and in shielding layer made of steel (steel1), in concrete1, DI1 and in the first polyethylene layer made of BPE or LiPE. The highest number of stopped neutrons for configuration 2 is caused by the increased number of neutrons generated in this configuration.

The scatter plots for born and stopped photons are shown in Fig. 4 and 5, respectively. The total number of these events is found to be very high (more than 7 millions events) and is comparable for all configurations.

Monte-Carlo simulations generated the spectra of neutrons leaking from different layers of the JF shielding as well as the spectra of the leaking photons. Spectra in the range 0-1 GeV obtained for neutrons escaping layers for configurations 1 (baseline), 2 (all-ductile-iron solution), 5 (all concrete) and 9 (segmented shielding) are given in figures 6, 7, 8 and 9. Figure 10 shows full spectra of neutrons entering the JF shielding from outside for all configurations.

Figures 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 and 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 present the results of neutrons leaking out of different layers of the JF shielding for configurations 1 (baseline), 2 (all-ductile-iron solution), 5 (all concrete), 9 (segmented shielding) and 11 (ductile iron was replaced by steel) in energy regions 0-10 keV and 10-100 keV, 100-1000 keV and 1-10 MeV, respectively.

The results for all configurations are summarized in Tables 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Calculations were done without the GAMLIB library for all configurations and with the GAMLIB library for configurations 1, 2, 3 and 9. Since the calculations performed with GAMLIB were expecting to give more realistic results for generated photons, it was necessary to repeat simulations for the configurations expected to be the most promising. The reason for this selection was that these configurations are most frequently proposed solutions for JF shielding from the point of view of physics [3], [7], technology [6] and cost.

Table 1 compares the number of neutrons escaping between layers for different configurations of the JF shielding. The results show that the lowest total number of leaking

and No. 4 (see Table 1). The relative effectiveness of the configurations are as follows: No. 9 - 100%, No. 4 - 103.5%, No. 8 - 108.3%, No. 3 - 112.6%, No. 10 - 114.1%, No. 11 - 117.4%, No. 7 - 143.4%, No. 1 - 164.1%, No. 6 - 228.1%, No. 2 - 462.5%, No. 5 - 703.8%. The comparison between the numbers of escaped and stopped neutrons allows one to conclude that the suppression of neutrons due to the shielding is effective (No. 1 - 0.058%, No. 2 - 0.137%, No. 3 - 0.040%, No. 4 - 0.037%, No. 5 - 0.282%, No. 6 - 0.078%, No. 7 - 0.051%, No. 8 - 0.038%, No. 9 - 0.036%, No. 10 - 0.040%). The situation is changed when the layers 3, 4 and 5 (in some configurations) are removed. In this case the numbers of escaped neutrons are substantially larger (No. 1 - 0.86%, No. 2 - 1.50%, No. 3 - 0.78%, No. 4 - 1.06%, No. 5 - 0.82%, No. 6 - 0.24%, No. 7 - 0.16%, No. 8 - 1.27%, No. 9 - 1.07%, No. 10 - 1.04%).

Table 2 shows the comparison between the numbers of escaping and entering neutrons for all calculated configurations. According to the results presented in Table 2 the numbers of neutrons escaping and entering the JF shielding are approximately comparable, supporting the addition of an outer layer of LiPE as proposed in the segmented shielding (configuration 9). The addition of an outer LiPE layer prevents the production of photons due to neutron capture in JF shielding.

Table 3 summarizes the distribution of escaping neutrons along Z axis for all the configurations. It confirms that the regions A, B, C play a more critical role with regard to escaping neutrons, as expected, since these regions are closer to the interaction point and of lower thickness (fig. 1). However, for configuration 5 (all concrete) the maximum number of leaking neutrons is shifted in Z toward region D.

Table 4 gives the comparison of the efficiency at suppressing the photons leaking out of the JF shielding for all configurations obtained without using GAMLIB and for configurations 1, 2, 3 and 9 with the use of GAMLIB. The Monte-Carlo simulations performed without GAMLIB show that the overall best suppression of leaking photons is achieved for configuration 1. The total number of leaking \(\gamma\)-rays from configuration 1 compared with numbers achieved with the other configurations leads to following relative increases: 1 - 100%, 2 - 268%, 3 - 208%, 4 - 221%, 5 - 1257%, 6 - 578%, 7 - 549%, 8 - 207%, 9 - 151%, 10 - 151%, 11 - 195%. The situation was completely changed using GAMLIB, where the strongest suppression was achieved for configuration 9. Simulations with GAMLIB give an increased photon yield for the studied configurations.

Comparison of configurations 1, 3 and 9 with regard to the efficiency of the shielding at suppressing photons is shown in table 5. The results presented in this table show that the same photon suppression can be achieved by either 10 cm of steel or by 5 cm of lead.

## 4 Conclusions

The aim of this work was to evaluate the effectiveness of the configurations proposed as candidates [3] for the shielding of the ATLAS forward region (JF shielding) as well as to understand the functionality of the shielding layers. The results obtained support the following conclusions:

* The efficiency of the JF shielding is improved by additional layers of BPE or LiPE and iron.
* The efficiency of the JF shielding is improved by adding an outer layer of LiPE to suppress the influence of neutrons entering from outside after being reflected by the ATLAS cavern walls and parts of the ATLAS detector.
* Concrete is not an adequate material for neutron suppression in the present situation. Comparison of the results from configurations 4 and 7 (differ by the replacement shielding using concrete. Also the neutron spectrum is shifted by a factor 2.3 towards higher energies in the case of concrete, as mean energies for neutrons escaping from configurations 4 and 7 are 14.82 MeV and 33.56 MeV, respectively.
* The second layer should be made of ductile iron. The advantage of ductile iron over steel for achieving a lower number of escaped neutrons (suppressing factor of 6.3 in favor of ductile iron) is shown in Table 1 (comparison of configurations 9 and 11, column 2).
* Lead has negative influence when compared with steel regarding the number of escaping neutrons. In the case of the configuration with a lead layer, the number of escaping neutrons is larger by a factor 2.1 compared to the number of entering neutrons (see Table 1, configuration 1, columns 3 and 4). This is most probably a consequence of the generation of additional spallation neutrons in lead. The same factor for steel (see Table 1, configurations 4, 8, 9 and 10, columns 3 and 4) is 1.3. This factor is an average number for the four configurations listed above.
* The same efficiency from the point of view of photon shielding is achieved either using steel layer 10 cm thick or using lead layer 5 cm thick (see Table 5). However, steel is a better structural material [6].

According to our Monte-Carlo results, configuration 9 is the best solution for the JF shielding with regard to photon and neutron suppression. The final decision should be based not only on Monte-Carlo simulation results, but also on the technical feasibility of the selected composition and on costs. Taking into account these constraints, there are several possible solutions, which should be considered carefully regarding their technical and financial aspects, e.g. segmented shielding, all-ductile-iron solution, ductile iron with outer layer made of LiPE solution.
