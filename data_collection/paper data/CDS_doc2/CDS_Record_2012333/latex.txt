Commitment of the Institutions Hosting ATLAS Data

The WLCG MOU [1] describes the commitment of the institutions hosting ATLAS data.

### Preservation of Physics Results & the Ability to Re-derive Them

To produce physics results from ATLAS data, human resources are required in addition to the preservation of data, metadata and documentation. Some of the processes, such as the internal peer review of intermediate and final results, cannot be captured as fully documented, reproducible procedures. The ATLAS Collaboration intends to maintain the knowledge necessary to perform and review physics analysis for as long as possible after data taking ceases.

ATLAS internal documentation relating to physics results, for example the detailed analysis notes that are input to internal review processes, are maintained in a professionally operated document management system.

Scientific outputs published in journals, or submitted to repositories such as arXiv and HEPDATA are assumed to be preserved by the journals or repository operators. In addition they are also archived by the ATLAS Collaboration.

### Outreach and Educational Formats

ATLAS also produces outreach and educational datasets and formats, both for use by ATLAS members and for third parties. While it commits to supporting these activities, it makes no long-term commitment to preserving these datasets and specific formats.

### Data Preservation Beyond the Lifetime of the Collaboration

At the point at which the collaboration becomes inactive, the intention is that the raw collision data and a selection of derived formats will be preserved and made available, along with the appropriate version of the processing software, metadata and associated simulation software.
