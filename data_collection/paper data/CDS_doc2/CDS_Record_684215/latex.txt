ABSTRACT

This note presents the results of a study of the production and detection of a MSSM Higgs (\(A^{0}\)), decaying into the di-muon final state, and new gauge bosons \(Z^{\prime}\) and \(W^{\prime}\), decaying into the di-muon and single muon final states, respectively. A full detector hit-level simulation of the ATLAS muon spectrometer, operating in the stand-alone mode, has been used.

Generic Muon Spectrometer Performance

High precision mass reconstruction and high reconstruction efficiency of multi-muon final states are essential features of a muon system needed for new particle searches at the LHC. Discovery of new physics also requires clean identification of muon charges. The ATLAS muon spectrometer, operated in the stand-alone mode, provides a robust tool for the search for physics beyond the standard model. In order to evaluate the operation of the ATLAS muon system we have carried out generic studies on these performances of the muon spectrometer using benchmark physics processes.

The mass resolution and the multi-muon event reconstruction efficiency for our muon system was evaluated with full detector simulation and reconstruction. The computer programs used in our studies are listed below:

* **Physics event generator:** PYTHIA (V. 5.7) and JETSET (V. 7.4)[1]. The single muon final state is generated using \(W^{\prime\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}+X\) process; Di-muon final states are generated using the MSSM model \(A^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) process for \(M_{\mu\mu}<\)800 GeV; and \(Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) for \(M_{\mu\mu}>800\) GeV. Four-muon final states are generated using the SM process: \(H^{0}\to Z^{0}Z^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\).
* **ATLAS detector simulation:** LHCTOR (V. 40400) [2]. LHCTOR is a GEANT [3] based simulation package. The detector geometry/material setup in the program is fixed by the latest muon chamber layout (version k) and the locations of the toroid coils of the magnet are simulated. Simplified models of the inner tracker and the calorimeters are used in the program. All the physics processes for particles interacting with the detector, such as \(\delta\)-ray production and dE/dx energy loss, are operative for all the simulations.
* **Muon track reconstruction:** MUONBOX (V. 50004) [4]. Using the chamber hit information, obtained from the detector simulation of LHCTOR, MUONBOX carries out detailed muon chamber digitization, taking into account the detector inefficiencies, chamber resolutions and alignment errors. Nominal background random hits are also included during the 'digitization' process. Thus under simulated realistic conditions, MUONBOX performs the muon track pattern recognition and momentum reconstruction in muon chambers.
* **Muon back-tracking to the IP:** BMCBOX (V. 011) [5]. This program performs the back-tracking of the muons to the IP (Interaction Point) while adding back the energy loss due to \(dE/dx\) and radiation to the reconstructed muon momentum using muon chamber data alone.

Reconstructed muon tracks in the spectrometer have been required to pass the tracking fitting criteria described in [4]. The selected _good_ tracks are used for invariant mass reconstruction, using the full momentum reconstruction of the muons at the IP.

We summarize our results on the Monte Carlo (MC) event reconstruction efficiencies and mass resolutions with two plots:

1. The di-muon event reconstruction efficiency as a function of the di-muon mass (\(M_{\mu\mu}\)) is shown in Fig. 1a, b, c, and d. Typical reconstruction efficiency of di-muon events is \(\sim 93\%\). The slight decrease of the efficiency in the high mass region is due to \(\delta\)-rays and muon bremsstrahlung, which affect the pattern recognition performance. The di-muon mass resolution (\(\sigma_{\Delta M/M}\): the standard deviation from the Gaussian fit for the distribution: \(M_{reconstruction}-M_{MC}/M_{MC}\)) as a function of the di-muon invariant mass (\(M_{\mu\mu}\)), is shown in Fig. 1c and 1d. The intrinsic mass resolution for di-muon final states is \(\sim 2.4\%\) to \(\sim 3.4\%\) for the mass region between 100 to 800 GeV. For the higher mass region (1 TeV to 5 TeV), the mass resolution becomes to \(4.2\%\) to \(13\%\).
2. The four-muon event reconstruction efficiency as function of the four-muon invariant mass (\(M_{4\mu}\)) is shown in Fig. 2a. The lower efficiency at the low mass region is due to the difficulty of reconstructing _soft_ muons. Typical efficiencies are \(\sim 88\%\) for mass greater than about 200 GeV. The four-muon intrinsic mass resolution (\(\sigma_{\Delta M/M}\)) as a function of the four-muon invariant mass (\(M_{4\mu}\)), is shown in Fig. 2b. We see that the resolution ranges between 2.0% to 2.6% for masses between 100 to 800 GeV.
3. Studies of the muon charge measurement capability were carried out using \(W^{\prime\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}\nu\) events. The probability of charge confusion is determined by the ratio of the reconstructed muon events with the wrong charge determination to the total reconstructed events. The charge confusion probability as function of the \(W^{\prime}\) mass is plotted in Fig. 3a for the barrel muon system, and in Fig. 3b for the end-cap muon system. As indicated in the plots, the charge confusion is less than 0.5% for a 1 TeV \(W^{\prime}\) charge measurement for the barrel, and it is \(\sim 1.2\%\) for the end-caps. Even at 6 TeV \(W^{\prime}\) mass, the charge confusion is \(\sim 4\%\) for the barrel region, and \(\sim 3\%\) for the end-caps.

We gauge the muon system performance against the requirements for new particle searches beyond the standard model using the results described above in the following sections.

## 2 MSSM Higgs process: \(A^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)

From helicity considerations a 'conventional Higgs scalar particle' is expected to have a very small branching ratio into di-muons. This is not necessarily so for the MSSM [7]. The Higgs sector of the MSSM contains two charged bosons, \(H^{\pm}\); three neutral CP-even bosons, \(h^{0}\), \(H^{0}\); and a CP-odd boson, \(A^{0}\). Due to the absence of \(Z^{0}Z^{0}\), \(W^{+}W^{-}\) and \(h^{0}h^{0}\) decay channels, the \(A^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) process becomes detectable for high \(tan\beta\), defining the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets. It will therefore be interesting to search for narrow peaks in the di-muon spectrum which would be a signature for an \(A^{0}\).

As a benchmark for searches of this kind using the ATLAS muon system in stand-alone mode we have simulated the process \(A^{0}->\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Table I shows the expected cross section times di-muon branching ratio for \(tan\beta=15\) and for \(tan\beta=30\), and the expected total number of events for a beam exposure of \(10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\).

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(M_{A}({\rm GeV})\) & \(\sigma_{tan\beta=15}\cdot Br(fb)\) & \(N_{A}^{exp}\) & \(\sigma_{tan\beta=30}\cdot Br(fb)\) & \(N_{A}^{exp}\) \\ \hline
150 & 14.2 & 1420 & 65.0 & 6500 \\
200 & 5.32 & 532 & 24.6 & 2460 \\
300 & 1.12 & 112 & 5.08 & 508 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The most critical issue in the detection of such a particle in the few hundred GeV mass range is the suppression of the very large di-muon background. There are two main sources of opposite-sign di-muons: 1) \(pp\to Z/\gamma^{*}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), which has a \(\sigma\times BR\sim 61\) pb (for \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>100\) GeV); and 2) \(pp\to t\bar{t}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}+X\), with \(\sigma\times BR\)\(\sim 7\) pb. In order to reject these backgrounds, we performed a full simulation and reconstruction of the background events. By requiring the transverse momentum of each muon, \(P_{T}^{\mu}\), to be greater than 10 GeV and the di-muon transverse momentum, \(P_{T}^{\mu\mu}\), to be greater than 20 GeV, we are able to reject the dominant \(Z/\gamma^{*}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) background by a factor of 6.7. We further reject the \(t\bar{t}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) background by requiring the transverse missing energy in the events to be less than 40 GeV and the muons to be _isolated_ (this is done with the fast simulation package, ATLFAST [8]). The consequent rejection factor for \(t\bar{t}\) is 5.7. The detection efficiencies for the Higgs signature are listed in Table II, as well as the expected selected number of signal events and background events within the \(M_{A}\pm 2\sigma_{M}\) region.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(M_{A}\)(GeV) & \(\epsilon_{sel}\) (\%) & \(N_{A}^{exp}\) & \(N_{DY}\) & \(N_{t\bar{t}}\) & \(S/\sqrt{B}\) \\ \hline
150 & 48.4 & 3149 & 47110 & 6536 & 13.6 \\
200 & 53.4 & 1313 & 23238 & 6252 & 7.65 \\
300 & 61.2 & 311 & 7185 & 2066 & 3.23 \\ \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Expected Events and \(S/\sqrt{B}\) for \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\) (\(tan\beta=30\))} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(M_{A}\)(GeV) & \(\sigma\cdot Br(fb)\) & \(N_{A}^{exp}\) & \(N_{DY}\) & \(N_{t\bar{t}}\) & \(S/\sqrt{B}\) \\ \hline
150 & 14.2 & 688 & 47110 & 6536 & 2.97 \\
200 & 5.32 & 284 & 23238 & 6252 & 1.65 \\
300 & 1.12 & 69 & 7185 & 2066 & 0.72 \\ \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Expected Events and \(S/\sqrt{B}\) for \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\) (\(tan\beta=15\))} \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Over a large region of the MSSM parameter space, the \(H^{0}\) and \(A^{0}\) are degenerate in mass. As a consequence, the signal rates in the di-muon channel can be added. For the summed signal, we present the di-muon mass spectrum for 150 GeV mass Higgs superimposed on the background in Fig. 4a, where we see that a clear peak is observable. The background-subtracted mass distribution is presented in Fig. 4b. We also present the di-muon mass spectrum for 300 GeV mass Higgs superimposed on the background in Fig. 5a. In Fig. 5b, the background-subtracted mass distribution is presented corresponding to roughly 600 reconstructed events. We conclude that the MSSM Higgs should be detectable with the ATLAS muon system for high values of \(tan\beta\).

## 3 New neutral gauge boson detection: \(Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)

One or more new neutral heavy vector bosons are predicted by many theories attempting to extend the Standard Model. Examples are \(E_{6}\)-models [9], \(Left-Right\) symmetric models [10], models with SM-like \(Z^{\prime}\)-couplings [11] and composite models [12]. Despite their theoretical richness, none of these models makes any prediction of the mass of the \(Z^{\prime}\). At this time, the Fermilab experiment CDF has set a lower mass limit on the \(Z^{\prime}\) of 690 GeV [13], and expect to probe for \(Z^{\prime}\)s up to 900 GeV with RunII data. Hence, searches in the mass region greater than 1 TeV will be of interest at the LHC.

The discovery of a \(Z^{\prime}\) involves the observation of a di-muon mass peak above background. For high masses, the background (mainly from the DY process \(pp\to Z^{0}/\gamma^{*}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)) is very small. We show a reconstructed 3 TeV \(Z^{\prime}\) mass distribution in Fig. 7, where the background (DY) is included in the plot. We have investigated the possible background from the \(t\bar{t}->\mu^{+}\mu^{-}+X\) process, and found that \(t\bar{t}\) contribution is negligible.

Once a new vector boson \(Z^{\prime}\) is discovered, the question arises of how to uniquely determine its fermion couplings in order to distinguish different gauge theories. The properties of the \(Z^{\prime}\) couplings may be probed by the charge asymmetry determined by the chiral coupling constants. This quantity is measurable at the LHC since \(Z^{\prime}\)s are produced by the annihilation of quarks and antiquarks, with the quark generally being at a higher momentum than the antiquark; the \(Z^{\prime}\) momentum therefore defines the quark direction. The following ratio defines the forward/backward charge asymmetry:

\[A_{FB}=\frac{\sigma(cos\theta^{*}>0)-\sigma(cos\theta^{*}<0)}{\sigma(cos\theta ^{*}>0)+\sigma(cos\theta^{*}<0)},\]

where \(cos\theta^{*}=sgn(\eta_{B})tanh(\frac{\eta_{-}-\eta_{+}}{2})\), and \(\eta_{B}=\frac{1}{2}(\eta_{-}+\eta_{+})\) is the rapidity of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson. The theoretic asymmetries for different models are illustrated in Fig. 6 (without the detector resolution smearing); the errors indicated in the figure correspond to 1000 \(Z^{\prime}\)s decaying into dimuons. The SM asymmetry is expected to be small and positive based on measurements at LEP and the SLD. The \(E_{6}-I\) model has very large and negative asymmetry.

With full detector simulation and reconstruction, we determined the parameters of \(Z^{\prime}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) detection shown in the following table:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Model & \(SM\) & \(SM\) & \(E_{6}-I\) & \(E_{6}-I\) \\ \hline \(Z^{\prime}\) Mass (TeV) & 1 & 3 & 1 & 3 \\ \hline \(\sigma\times BR(\text{pb})\) & 0.51 & \(2.5\times 10^{-3}\) & 0.24 & \(9.9\times 10^{-4}\) \\ \hline rec. events \(>1\mu\) & 93.0\% & 92.4\% & 92.8\% & 93.4\% \\ fract. same charge events & 2.2\% & 4.1\% & 1.3\% & 3.8\% \\ events for \(A_{FB}\) & 90.8\% & 88.3\% & 91.5\% & 89.6\% \\ events for \(10^{5}pb^{-1}\) & \(4.6\times 10^{4}\) & 221 & \(2.2\times 10^{4}\) & 89 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Using our simulation of the ATLAS muon system we show in Fig. 8a and 8b the expected measured asymmetry for \(Z^{\prime}\)s at 1 and 3 TeV masses for SM and \(E_{6}-I\) model couplings as a function of the upper muon detection rapidity cut. Note that at \(M_{Z^{\prime}}=1\) TeV, with \(\sim\) two days of data taking at the LHC (\(\sim 1000~{}Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) events), the statistics of the measured asymmetry are sufficient to distinguish these two models. At 3 TeV, we need about 2 years of running time (\(2\times 10^{5}pb^{-1}\)) to reach the experimental accuracy on the asymmetry of \(\sim 4.2\%\) for the SM couplings and of \(\sim 8.4\%\) for the \(E_{6}-I\) model (the difference is due to different production rates predicted by the models). The statistical errors shown in the plots are calculated based on the expected number of events as determined by the full simulation and reconstruction. For a given number of detected events the statistical error on \(A_{FB}\) is \(\Delta A_{FB}\sim 1/\sqrt{N}\), where N is the total number of events detected.

Fig. 8 also illustrates the need to have good rapidity coverage in the muon system. Not only is the asymmetry greater at higher rapidity, but also the statistics are larger when a high rapidity cut is possible. Hence the ATLAS end-caps are essential to investigate this important physics.

With a beam exposure of \(10^{5}~{}pb^{-1}\), the ATLAS muon detector will be able to detect a massive \(Z^{\prime}\) up to a mass of approximately 4 TeV. The asymmetry may be used to distinguish various couplings with accuracy (\(\Delta A_{FB}\)) better than 3% for \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) less than 2 TeV. But at higher masses, where the statistics become limited, much more beam exposure time is needed to distinguish models.

## 4 New charged gauge boson detection: \(W^{\prime\pm}\rightarrow\mu^{\pm}\nu\)

At present, the best direct experimental limit on new \(W^{\prime}\) mass is \(>625\) GeV from Fermilab. This limit is expected to improve to 990 GeV with Run II data [13]. Therefore, searches in the mass region \(M_{W^{\prime}}>1\) TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC will be of interest.

The observation of the \(W^{\prime}\) is based on the detection of an excess of single muons at high \(P_{T}\) above background, with a sharp upper edge. With SM couplings, the branching fraction for \(W^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu\nu\) is expected to be of order 8%. The majority backgrounds for the \(W^{\prime}\) detection come from the processes, \(pp\to W+X\rightarrow\mu+X\), and \(pp\to t\bar{t}\to W^{+}bW^{-}b\rightarrow\mu+X\).

The \(W^{\prime}\) production rates predicted by the Extended Gauge Model (SM-like couplings) [11] as a function of the \(W^{\prime}\) mass are listed in the following table:The background production cross section times the branching ratio (\(\sigma\times BR\)) are \(2.3\times 10^{-1}\) pb and \(2.0\times 10^{-1}\) pb for \(W+x\rightarrow\mu+X\) and \(t\bar{t}\rightarrow\mu+X\), respectively. Two partonic kinematical cuts of the PYTHIA program were applied when calculating the above cross sections. These cuts were: (1) \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>1500GeV\), and (2) \(\hat{P_{T}}>200GeV\).

In order to reject the background, we used two simple cuts to select single muon events:

* Transverse momentum of the muon (\(P_{T}^{\mu}\)) should be greater than 200 GeV;
* Transverse missing energy (\(E_{T}^{miss}\)) should be greater than 200 GeV.

The background rejection factor is 5.15 for the \(W+X\) process, and 19.6 for the \(t\bar{t}\) process. The signal selection efficiency is better than 95%.

Fig. 9 shows the single muon \(P_{T}\) spectrum of the \(W^{\prime}\) superimposed on the background, for the ATLAS muon system operating in stand-alone mode; Fig. 9a shows a 2 TeV \(W^{\prime}\); Fig. 9b a 3 TeV \(W^{\prime}\); and Fig. 9c a 4 TeV \(W^{\prime}\).

The transverse mass improves the upper edge shape of the \(W^{\prime}\) signature. By combining the measured muon transverse momentum with the missing transverse energy measurement, the transverse mass can be defined as:

\(m_{T}=\sqrt{(P_{T}^{\mu}+E_{T}^{miss})^{2}-(P_{x}^{\mu}+E_{x}^{miss})^{2}-(P_ {y}^{\mu}+E_{y}^{miss})^{2}}\).

The distribution of this variable shows a sharp upper edge \(\sim M_{W^{\prime}}\). As an example, we plot the \(m_{T}\) spectrum for a 3 TeV \(W^{\prime}\) superimposed on the background in Fig. 10. With an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\ pb^{-1}\), it will be possible to detect a massive \(W^{\prime}\) through the muon decay channel up to 5-6 TeV.
