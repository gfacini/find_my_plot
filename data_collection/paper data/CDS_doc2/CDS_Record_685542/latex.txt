**Abstract**

This note describes an original method which has been developed to determine the trapping time constants in irradiated silicon using the data of the ATLAS Pixel Detector test beams.

The charge collection efficiency is measured as a function of the drift length in irradiated silicon, and the charge carrier trapping lifetime is extracted comparing the data with a numerical simulation of the detector response to ionizing particles.

The measurements have been performed on pixel detectors irradiated with protons to a fluence of \(1.1\cdot 10^{15}\) n\({}_{\rm eq}\)cm\({}^{-2}\).

A trapping lifetime of \((2.3\pm 0.8)\) ns is found after annealing to minimum in full depletion voltage, while it is \((4.1\pm 0.7)\) ns after 25 h annealing at 60 \({}^{0}\)C.

Comparison with measurements made with the transient current technique is discussed.

## 1 Introduction

At the LHC silicon vertex detectors will be exposed to unprecedented levels of ionizing and not-ionizing radiation. The innermost layer of the ATLAS Pixel Detector is required to be tolerant to an ionizing dose of 500 kGy and a hadronic fluence1 of \(10^{15}\) n\({}_{\rm eq}\)cm\({}^{-2}\).

Footnote 1: Hadronic fluence are normalized to the 1 MeV neutron fluence which gives the same non-ionizing energy loss.

As a consequence of displacement damage arising from hadronic radiation, the silicon detectors will change their characteristics during their lifetime [1, 2].

Potential radiation-induced performance degradation is a serious issue, which needs to be studied in detail.

The main radiation-induced changes in the macroscopic properties of silicon detector sensors are an increase in the leakage current, an increase of the reverse bias needed to completely deplete the sensor (full depletion voltage \(V_{f\,d}\)), and a reduction of the charge collection efficiency (CCE) because of the introduction of electron and hole trapping centers.

The dynamics of defects and the related changes of full depletion voltage and leakage current have been extensively studied [1, 2]. Measurements of the effective trapping probability responsible for the decrease in CCE are, on the other hand, much more scarce. Most methods used for the determination of effective trapping time \(\tau\) are based on measurements of time-resolved current shapes in silicon diodes (Transient Current Technique).

TCT measurements made on standard and oxygen-enriched silicon diodes irradiated with charged and neutral hadrons have been reported [3, 4] up to fluences of the order of \(2\times 10^{14}\) n\({}_{\rm eq}\)cm\({}^{-2}\). The trapping probability is found to have a linear dependence on the fluence, \(1/\tau=\beta\Phi\).

TCT measurements require a bias voltage scan above \(V_{fd}\), which for a given fluence depends on the thermal history of the detector, reaching a minimum value after about 10 days of defect annealing at room temperature. Hence the samples are usually annealed to the minimum in \(V_{fd}\) before the measurements. At the LHC, however, the warm-up of the silicon detectors during maintenance period will result in a greater defect annealing.

Some measurements of trapping time as a function of defect annealing time have been reported [4]. These measurements show that the electron trapping lifetime increases with annealing, reaching a saturation value which is 30% higher that the trapping time at the minimum in \(V_{fd}\). The hole trapping lifetime, which is already smaller than the electron lifetime at the minimum in \(V_{fd}\), decreases with annealing by about 30% before reaching a saturation value. These measurements, however, were limited to low-fluence neutron irradiation (\(7.5\times 10^{13}\) n\({}_{\rm eq}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)).

In ATLAS the Pixel Detector will be exposed to fluences up to \(10^{15}\) n\({}_{\rm eq}\)cm\({}^{-2}\), with both neutral and charged particle contributions, and defect annealing during warm-up periods will bring the detectors much past the point corresponding to the minimum in \(V_{fd}\). Measuring the trapping time constants in these conditions is important to compute the effects of radiation damage on the ATLAS Inner Tracker performances, as the effect of charge trapping on the signal/n\(\ddot{\rm a}\)se ratio can not be neglected. Extrapolation of the measurements in the literature leads to trapping time constants of the order of 2 ns, corresponding to a mean drift path of the order of 100 \(\mu\)m, less than the depleted region thickness.

## 2 The tested devices

The ATLAS Pixel sensors [5] consist of n\({}^{+}\) implants on a high resistivity n-bulk substrate. The substrate is oxygenated to improve its radiation hardness.

The pixel dimensions are 50 \(\times\) 400 \(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) and the sensor thickness is 250 \(\mu\)m. The isolation between pixels is achieved with the p-_spray_ technique [5, 6].

The tested devices had a 8 \(\times\) 8 mm\({}^{2}\) sensor connected to a front-end electronics chip [7] of the same size.

Every pixel cell in the sensor is connected via bump-bonding[8] to a matching cell in the front-end chip, which includes a charge preamplifier and a discriminator. The pulse height is obtained from the time the signal stays over the discriminator threshold. The 8-bits Time-Over-Threshold (ToT) is calibrated [7] for each pixel by injecting a known charge. The accuracy of the overall energy scale determined by the calibrations is about 10%. During test-beam operation the pixel thresholds had a mean value of 3000 electrons with a dispersion of 300 electrons rms. The noise was 400 electrons.

Irradiation was performed after bump-bonding at the CERN PS with a beam of 20 GeV protons. The detectors received the total ionizing dose of 600 kGy, corresponding to a fluence of 1.1 \(\times\) 10\({}^{15}\) n\({}_{\rm eq}\)cm\({}^{-2}\). In this paper measurements relative to five detectors (code-named A,B,I,T2 and T3) are presented.

The test beam was performed at the CERN SPS accelerator with a pion beam of 180 GeV/\(c\) momentum. A beam telescope [9] consisting of 4 pairs of double-sided silicon microstrip modules was used to track the particles. The position resolution of tracks projected onto the devices under test was 6 \(\mu\)m.

During irradiation, the devices were kept between -4 \({}^{0}\)C and -10 \({}^{0}\)C suppressing defect annealing processes. After irradiation they were stored at -20 \({}^{0}\)C and during test beam operation they were operated at temperatures between -7 \({}^{0}\)C and -12 \({}^{0}\)C.

After the first period of test-beam data-taking (June 2002) the T2 device was annealed to the minimum in \(V_{fd}\), while the other devices were annealed for 25 h at 60 \({}^{0}\), which should correspond to the annealing of the ATLAS Pixel sensors after 10 years of operation at the LHC. After the annealing the devices were tested again in the July and August 2002 test-beam periods.

Events were filtered with the requirement of one and only one track reconstructed by the silicon microstrip telescope in each event [10]. Tracks were required to extrapolate into a fiducial region inside the pixel sensors. In addition. only events with a track \(\chi^{2}\)-probability greater than 0.02 were kept.

## 3 Measurement strategy

To perform measurements of the trapping time constants, data were taken with the particle beam incident on the sensor at an angle of 30\({}^{0}\) with respect to the normal to the sensor plane (Fig. 1). A particle crossing the detector produces a cluster of hits consisting of the pixel cells that collect a significant fraction of the charge released in the subtended segment of the track.

Because the width of the pixel electrodes is much smaller than the sensor thickness, the signal on the pixel is induced by charges moving relatively close to it (the Ramo potential2 is shown in Fig. 2), at a depth comparable with or smaller than the pixel width.

Hence, the holes moving away from the pixels give a significant contribution to the signal only when they are released very close to the pixels. When an electron/hole pair is generated deep in the sensor, the signal is due to the electrons which reach the region near the pixel where the Ramo potential is significant.

In absence of trapping all the electrons released by the track reach this region and the signal they induce does not depend on the depth of their release in silicon. In irradiated detectors, however, electrons which are released far from the pixel electrodes induce a smaller signal, as they are trapped before reaching the region near the pixel.

Thus the electron trapping can be measured considering the charge collected by a pixel as a function of the depth \(d\) of the track segment under the pixel (Fig. 1). \(d\) can be measured from the pixel position and the tracking information of the silicon microstrip telescope, with an error of about 6 \(\mu\)m/ tan \(\alpha\simeq 10\)\(\mu\)m.

A value of \(\alpha=30^{0}\) has been chosen for this measurement. Larger angles

Figure 1: Schematic view of a sensor crossed by a track at 30 degrees incidence angle.

results in a low track segment length under the pixel, so that even for low values of \(d\) the average collected charge is not much larger than the electronic threshold. At small angles each pixel collects charge from most (or all) of the sensor thickness, because of its finite size.

In Fig. 3 the charge collected by a pixel as a function of the track depth \(d\), measured from the pixel position and the track parameters determined by the telescope, is compared for a not irradiated and two irradiated 250 \(\mu\)m thick sensors.

In the not irradiated sensor the collected charge is constant as long as the track segment subtended by the pixel is entirely within the sensor3. In the irradiated sensors charge trapping results in a decrease of charge collection efficiency with the depth \(d\).

Footnote 3: This occurs for \(I<d<D-I\) with \(I=p/(2\tan\alpha)\), where \(D=250\)\(\mu\)m is the sensor thickness and \(p=50\)\(\mu\)m is the pixel width. At \(30^{0}\)\(I=58\)\(\mu\)m in agreement with data.

The charge scale provided by the calibrations for each detector is affected by an uncertainty of the order of 10%, which is of the same order of magnitude of the charge lost because of trapping. Hence the charge collection profiles were normalized to the average value in the interval \(d=50\div 80\)\(\mu\)m and only the shape of the distribution was used to investigate trapping effects.

The Ramo potential is plotted in the \(xz\) plane, where \(z\) is the depth coordinate and \(x\) is the coordinate along the short pixel dimension. The pixel center at the origin of the coordinates.

## 4 Charge collection profiles

In Fig. 4 the shapes of charge collection profiles are compared for sensor A before annealing, sensor T2 after annealing to the minimum in \(V_{fd}\), sensors A and B after annealing for 25 h at 60\({}^{0}\). All data were taken at 600 V bias voltage.

It can be noticed that the charge collection efficiency of sensor A increases after annealing. Sensor T2 has a much lower CCE than any of the other devices. The data points for sensors I and T3 after 25 h annealing at 60\({}^{0}\) lay within the curves for sensor A and B and have not be reported in the figure for clarity.

The charge collection efficiency as a function of the bias voltage has also been investigated. In Fig. 5 the charge collected profiles are reported for different bias voltage and for sensor A (the dependence on bias voltage is similar for the other sensors). The CCE is basically the same at 600 V and 700 V, indicating that the mean free path \(l=v_{d}\tau\) is independent of bias voltage because of saturation of the drift velocity \(v_{d}\) at high electric fields. When the bias voltage is lowered to 400 V the signal is significantly reduced. The same behavior is observed in all tested devices.

In Fig. 6 the charge collection profile is compared for a not-oxygenated device (sensor S) operated in the 1998 test beam [16] and the oxygenated sensor A. The not-oxygenated sensor was only partially depleted (\(D=(189\pm 12)\mu\)m, [16]) at 600 V despite being irradiated to a somewhat lower fluence (\(10^{15}\) n\({}_{\rm eq}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)). The two profiles should thus be compared only for track segment depths well inside the depletion region (\(d<150\)\(\mu\)m). No evidence of a CCE difference between the two sensors can be seen within this range and the available statistics.

## 5 Extraction of trapping times

The extraction of the microscopic trapping parameters (hole and electron lifetimes) from the charge collection profiles is not straightforward. The shape of

Figure 5: Pixel charge as a function of track depth, for different bias voltages and for sensor A.

the Ramo potential, the discriminator threshold, the finite pixel size and the fluctuations in the energy deposited by the particle must be taken into account.

This section describes how the slope of the charge collection profile was related to the carriers lifetime using a numerical simulation [13] which includes all these effects, and presents the resulting measured lifetimes for the tested devices.

### The numerical simulation

The interaction of the pions with the pixel detector were simulated using the Geant4 package [14]. The charge deposited by the particle in the silicon sensor was divided in small units (25 electrons or holes each) and each unit was separately drifted inside the silicon until it reached the electrodes or it was trapped.

After each drift step, the lateral diffusion r.m.s. and the trapping probability were computed as

\[\sigma=\sqrt{2Dt}=\sqrt{2\mu_{0}\frac{kT}{q}\frac{l}{\mu E}} \tag{1}\]

\[P(\mathrm{trapping})=e^{-t/\tau}=e^{-l/(\mu E\tau)} \tag{2}\]

\(D\) is the lateral diffusivity. It is nearly independent of the electric field [15] so it has been computed using the Einstein relation with the low-field mobility \(\mu_{0}\). \(l\) is the drift step. The carrier mobility \(\mu(E,T)\) was computed from the local

electric field and the temperature using parameterizations [15] of experimental data.

The distribution of electric field inside irradiated silicon sensors is poorly known. The trapping of charge carrier by defect centers affect the distribution of space charge inside the sensor. Evidence for a not uniform space charge distribution, producing a double-peak electric field profile, has been reported [12]. For the results presented here, a constant electric field was used. This is justified in the approximation of very high bias voltage, because the drift velocity reaches the saturation value and does not depend on the electric field. The lifetime was thus estimated from the data taken at the highest available bias voltage (700 V) while the systematic error associated to the constant field approximation was estimated from the difference between the lifetimes measured at 700 V and 600 V.

The charge induced by the moving charges on the pixel electrodes was computed using the Ramo potential [11]. Finally, cross-talk between pixels, the discriminator threshold and noise were simulated.

The tracking telescope was not simulated. The position of the track intercept with the pixel detector provided by tracking was simulated smearing the Montecarlo true position with a gaussian. The gaussian r.m.s was 6 \(\mu\)m, which is the telescope extrapolation resolution after the standard track quality cuts [10, 16]. The same clustering algorithm and analysis used for real data was applied to simulated events.

The parameters used in the simulation were either measured values (cross-talk, threshold, threshold dispersion, noise, bias voltage, sensor thickness) or were taken from the literature on charge drift in silicon (mobility, diffusivity). Free parameters are the lifetimes \(\tau_{\epsilon},\tau_{h}\).

### Measured trapping times and discussion

In Fig. 7 the distribution of the simulated charge collection profiles is reported for several values of \(\tau\) and a bias voltage of 700 V. Electron and hole lifetimes are assumed to be equal. The experimental data of sensor B are reported as well.

The value of \(\tau\) can be extracted by comparing the simulated and experimental distributions. The agreement between the simulation and the data is very good when the best value of the lifetime is chosen. The comparison was made in the interval 80 \(\mu\)m \(<d<\) 200 \(\mu\)m, where the distribution is more sensitive to the value of the trapping lifetime \(\tau\).

The trapping-sensitive variable chosen to extract \(\tau\) from the data was the average of \(Qd\), the product of the track segment depth and the normalized charge. A smaller trapping lifetime results in a steeper decrease of \(Q\) with the depth and thus in a smaller value of \(<Qd>\).

While this variable is sensitive mostly to the electron lifetime, the hole trapping also plays a role. When the hole lifetime is decreased, at fixed \(\tau_{\epsilon}\), the signal for low track segment depth is reduced and the distribution becomes flatter (higher \(<Qd>\)). It proved very difficult to discriminate separately \(\tau_{\epsilon}\) and \(\tau_{h}\) from the distribution shape. The best value for the electron lifetime will be quoted for \(r=\tau_{e}/\tau_{h}=1\) and \(r=2\) instead.

In Fig. 8 the dependence of the simulated \(<Qd>\) on the electron lifetime is reported for \(r=1\) and for \(r=2\). The simulated points are fitted quite well by the relation \(<Qd>=a-b/\sqrt{(}\tau_{e})\) which is the solid line in the picture. The value of the electron lifetime is found as \(\tau_{e}=(\frac{b}{a-<Qd>_{\exp}})^{2}\).

The resulting values, assuming an equal hole and electron lifetime (\(r=1\)) are reported in table 1. The errors were evaluated from the spread in the values found for different test beam data-sets. The value found at the highest bias voltage was used as the best estimate of the lifetime, while the difference

between 600 V and 700 V bias voltage was considered the systematic error associated to the constant field approximation.

The values found for the four sensors annealed to the end-of-lifetime were compatible and were averaged, getting \(\tau=(4.1\pm 0.3\pm 0.6)\)ns, where the second error is the systematic related to the constant field approximation. The lifetime of the sensor annealed to the minimum in \(V_{fd}\) is \(\tau=(2.3\pm 0.2\pm 0.8)\)ns.

The table 2 reports the electron lifetime and the constant of proportionality in the relation \(1/\tau=\beta\Phi\) assuming an hole/electron lifetime ratio of \(r=1\) or \(r=2\). The value of the fluence, needed to measure \(\beta\), was \(\Phi=1.1\cdot 10^{15}\pm 5\%\)[17]. from the dosimetry measurements at the CERN PS.

The systematic errors associated to the trapping lifetime of different sensors are correlated, because they are related to the shape of the electric field distribution, which is similar for the different sensors. Evidence of this correla

tion is given by the observation that the difference between the lifetime values measured at 600 V and 700 V is similar for the five sensors (table 1).

It is difficult to give a precise estimation of this correlation, but it can be concluded that the difference between the trapping lifetime values reported in the first two rows of table 2 provides some evidence of a dependence of the trapping probability on annealing.

The TCT measurements reported in [4] are shown in table 3. The trapping damage constants found for diodes irradiated with protons up to 2.4 \(\cdot 10^{14}\) n\({}_{\mathrm{eq}}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)and annealed to the minimum in \(V_{fd}\) are compatible with the test-beam results presented in table 2.

The authors of ref. [4] also measured the annealing dependence of the trapping time constants, but only with diodes irradiated with neutrons at the relatively low fluence of \(0.75\cdot 10^{14}\) n\({}_{\mathrm{eq}}\)cm\({}^{-2}\). Caution is needed when comparing these results, which are also reported in table 3, with the trapping constants measured with proton-irradiated pixel detectors at the test beam, since the trapping constants measured in ref. [4] at the minimum in \(V_{fd}\) were different for samples irradiated with charged and neutral particles. It is thus not obvious that the annealing dependence is the same.

The decrease of the electron trapping constant is qualitatively in agreement with the test-beam measurements, but more modest.

## 6 Conclusions

A new method to measure the effect of charge trapping in irradiated silicon has been presented. The method allows to measure the electron lifetime with test-beam data once the electron/hole lifetime ratio is known.

The charge collection and charge carrier lifetimes were measured using test-beam data taken with silicon detectors irradiated to 1.1 \(10^{15}\) n\({}_{\mathrm{eq}}\)cm\({}^{-2}\).

Assuming \(\tau_{e}=\tau_{h}\) a lifetime of \((2.3\pm 0.2\pm 0.8)\) ns is found after annealing to the minimum in full depletion voltage, where the second error is the systematic related to the knowledge of the electric field distribution inside the sensor. The lifetime increases to \((4.2\pm 0.3\pm 0.7)\) ns after a further 25 h annealing at 60 \({}^{0}\)C, corresponding to the conditions foreseen for the ATLAS Pixel detector at the end of its operation at the LHC.
