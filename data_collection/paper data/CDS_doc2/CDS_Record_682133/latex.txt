## 1 Introduction

This brief note outlines the motivation for having an air core toroid as opposed to an iron core toroid. Physics examples for expected Standard Model and proposed non-Standard Model processes are used to illustrate the desirability of the air-core toroid over the iron-core.

The air-core provides an entirely independent instrument for identifying muons with better measurement quality than the iron-core. This has a number of consequences. The better resolution simplifies the physics analysis. It also allows us to trigger on and identify muons at lower momenta than in the iron-core.

## 2 A few specific physics examples

In the following we shall compare three different muon systems, a full air-core system, a barrel air-core with warm iron endcap system and a full iron-core system. The muon momentum resolutions expected are documented in the muon chapter of the LoI, in stand-alone mode and in combination with the inner tracking. The full air-core system does not benefit much from the inner tracking except at low muon momenta, whereas the iron systems display significantly better performance (comparable to the full air-core system) if inner tracking is included. In the following, we shall restrict ourselves to comparisons between the stand-alone systems.

We first illustrate the difference between the three muon systems in Tables 1 and 2, which display the expected mass resolutions on the reconstructed dimuon mass (Z mass) and 4-muon mass (Higgs mass). The Z-mass resolutions are quoted for a Higgs mass of 200 GeV/c\({}^{2}\). At relatively low muon momenta, there is quite some gain to be expected with air-core endcaps. This can also be seen in Table 2, over the full Higgs mass range from 130 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) to 200 GeV/c\({}^{2}\). For a Higgs mass of 200 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), the use of the Z-mass constraint on both Z bosons considerably decreases the difference between the various systems.

### Intermediate mass Higgs to 4 muons

For the intermediate mass Higgs, some (but not all) of the mass range may be measured entirely in the muon channel. This is illustrated in fig. 1 where the air-core, air plus iron endcap and all iron-core toroid performances are compared, for a Higgs boson with a mass of 150 GeV/c\({}^{2}\). The signal can be seen in the 4-muon channel with the air-core toroid, for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{8}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). This is much more difficult in the iron toroid case and even in the air plus iron endcap case. The significances of the signal are shown in tables 3 through 5, for Higgs masses of 130, 150 and 170 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), and for the all air, air plus iron endcap and all iron toroid options, respectively. Results are given both including and excluding isolation cuts based on the calorimeter. This example clearly demonstrates that a light particle with low cross section requires high resolution in both the barrel and endcap regions. After isolation cuts, the significance in the full air-core case is almost sufficient to see the signal over the full mass range.

### Heavy Higgs to 4 muons

The physics analysis for the heavier Higgs (\(M_{Higgs}=200\)GeV/c\({}^{2}\)) is simpler with a stand-alone air core system. Kinematic cuts on rapidity and transverse momentum reveal a very clear peak in the case of the air-core toroid, whereas further cuts on the invariant masses of the pairs of leptons and constraining their masses to the Z mass may be required for the iron core. This is illustrated in fig 2 and tab. 6. It is seen that the higher resolution barrel air-core (even if the endcaps are iron) is sufficient to discover the Higgs with simple kinematic cuts. Having a heavy particle that is therefore produced centrally emphasizes the usefulness of barrel toroid precision. The results for the optimal analysis for each system are also shown. As can be seen in Table 2, the optimal analysis implies the use of a Z-mass constraint for the air plus warm iron and full iron-core systems, but not for the full air-core system, which provides a resolution on the Z-mass comparable to the Z-width and therefore suffers from the use of a Z-mass constraint.

These results may also be viewed in terms of the discovery potential as a function of integrated luminosity for the various magnet options _vis-a-vis_ the Standard Model Higgs. This is illustrated in fig. 3 where the discovery cross-sections of the various options are shown with kinematic cuts only and in fig. 4 where the optimal situation is assumed for each toroid option. With the air-core option in stand-alone mode, a S.M. Higgs with a mass of 200 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) can be discovered for an integrated luminosity of \(\sim~{}2~{}10^{3}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), whereas \(\sim~{}5~{}10^{3}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) would be needed in the case of a full iron-core system in stand-alone mode.

### Measurement of Higgs width

For a heavier Higgs, the resolution of the air-core is sufficient to measure the width of the Higgs. This is an important piece of information (other than cross-section) in distinguishing a Standard Model Higgs from a non-standard model particle. This is illustrated in fig. 5, where the expected resolution of the reconstructed 4-muon mass is plotted for the various magnet options. The Standard model and SUSY Higgs widths are also indicated. It can be seen that the SUSY and Standard Model Higgs widths canbe distinguished above 220 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) for the Air core option, 250 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) for the Air core plus iron core endcaps option, and 290 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) for the All iron core option. In fig. 6 the measured width of the mass distribution of the Standard Model Higgs is plotted for each option. The intrinsic mass resolutions were calculated using the reconstructed width of a Standard Model Higgs having no intrinsic width.

### B-physics

The air-core toroid allows one to have a lower muon trigger and detection threshold. The air-core toroid system can trigger on muons as low as \(p_{t}^{\mu}\ >\ 6\) GeV/c and identify muons with \(p^{\mu}\ >\ 5\) GeV/c (assuming the first superlayer would be sufficient for this purpose).The iron core toroid system can trigger on muons as low as \(p_{t}^{\mu}\ >\ 12\) GeV/c and identify muons with \(p^{\mu}\ >\ 5\) GeV/c. The result of this is that for a measurement of CP violation in the B-system, the accuracy with which one can measure the CKM-matrix parameter, \(\sin 2\beta\), is improved from \(\delta\sin 2\beta=0.033\) for a full iron-core system to \(\delta\sin 2\beta=0.018\) for a full air-core system, due to the lower single muon trigger threshold. If the muons from J/\(\psi\) decay have to be identified as muons (due to combinatorial background from pion pairs under the J/\(\psi\) mass peak), the improvement on \(\delta\sin 2\beta\) is from 0.050 (iron-core) to 0.035 (air-core).

This last advantage of the air-core system is independent of the inner tracking, which is on the other hand essential to B-physics studies in itself.

## 3 Conclusions

In this note we have demonstrated several physics cases, where there is a clear advantage for ATLAS with an air-core muon magnet (at least in the barrel region).

The main advantage is in the (not to be neglected) ability to extract resonance signals in multi-muon channels in a stand-alone mode. We believe this ability to be a powerful asset for ATLAS, not because the inner tracking may fail or perform inadequately, but because it provides an independent tool to extract a signal, using only the lowest occupancy elements of the detector, and to compare such a signal to the one obtained in the electron channel. In particular an air-core system would allow us to observe a Standard Model Higgs boson of mass 200 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) at luminosities well below \(10^{33}\ cm^{-1}s^{-1}\).

Further studies are needed to assess more reliably the advantage from the lower muon trigger threshold for B-physics. This also applies to possible heavy ion physics, involving the measurement of bottomium states (\(\Upsilon\), \(\Upsilon^{\prime}\), \(\Upsilon^{\prime}\)).

Finally, although muon measurements beyond \(\sim 2\) TeV are limited by the chamber precision itself for both magnet systems, it may well be that new physics discovered in the TeV range will benefit from the best possible muon system. This is particularly true for the measurement of W' asymmetries and the search for \(W^{+}W^{+}\) states in the TeV region.
