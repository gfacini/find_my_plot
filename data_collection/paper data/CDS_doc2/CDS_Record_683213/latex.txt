**Abstract**

An investigation of the ageing of aluminum drift tubes in laboratory conditions has been made. The test was carried out with Ar+5%CO\({}_{2}\)+3%CH\({}_{4}\) gas mixture at 3 atm pressure and 3.2 kV applied to the wires. Two tubes were irradiated with radioactive sources \({}^{90}\)Sr (activity \(5\cdot 10^{8}\) Bq) and \({}^{204}\)Tl (\(2\cdot 10^{8}\) Bq). The rates of the detector ageing have been found to depend on an irradiation intensity. For detectors, in which the anode current was 1 \(\mu\)A, the rate of the gas gain reduction is estimated to be \((7\pm 1)\frac{\%}{C/cm}\) and for detector with the current 0.3 \(\mu\)A the gas gain reduction rate was \((15\pm 3)\frac{\%}{C/cm}\). At the end of irradiation the anode currents had increased by 20%. The features of this dark current are very similar to the Malter currents.

**Introduction**

The basic element of the ATLAS muon spectrometer are aluminum drift tubes (DT), which provide the precision muon tracking. Background studies which include the setup of the ATLAS detector /1/ have demonstrated that at some DT locations an integrated deposited charge must reach 0.13 C/cm after 10 years of LHC operation. Taking into account safety factor of 5 for uncertainties in the background calculations, DTs should tolerate 0.7 C/cm without noticeable degradation in their performance.

One candidat DT gas is a mixture of argon, CO\({}_{2}\) and methane. The ageing of the wire chambers with gas mixtures of such components have already been studied /2-6/. Although some kind of deposits on the surface of the signal wires were observed, there was no significant ageing in the gas mixtures with small CH\({}_{4}\) fraction. However one cannot make definite conclusions about ageing on the basis of those studies due to the strong dependence of the ageing on the details of the setup and operation, and due to different contents of CO\({}_{2}\) and CH\({}_{4}\) in the gas mixture have been used.

In this report first results of a systematic investigation under laboratory conditions of DT ageing are presented. The gas mixture was Ar+5%CO\({}_{2}\)+3%CH\({}_{4}\) at 3 atm which is currently one of candidates for the ATLAS muon system.

**Experimental procedure**

The experimental setup for the DT ageing studies is shown in fig.1. In this test we have tried to fix as many as possible parameters of DT to be equal to those in ATLAS conditions and to minimize an influence of parameters which have not yet been defined. It is known that the results of accelerated ageing tests could depend on an irradiation intensity /7,8/. For this reason the two DTs were tested at irradiation intensities which differ by approximately a factor of 3. The two \(\beta\)-sources, \({}^{90}\)Sr (\(5\cdot 10^{8}\) Bq) and \({}^{204}\)Tl (\(2\cdot 10^{8}\) Bq), were used for an irradiation. The collimated electron beams from the sources irradiated 12 mm of an anode wire length. At local irradiation we do not expected a influence of DT construction materials (end plugs and tubing). The third tube that was not irradiated was also used as a control detector. The test and control DTs were made of 100 mm long aluminum tubes 30 mm in diameter and 0.4 mm thick. The anodes were made of a gold-plated tungsten wire 50 \(\mu\)m in diameter and end plugs were made of kaprolon. Rubber O-rings were used for gas-tight. Before final assembly the tubes were cleaned with alcohol.

The gas volumes of the control detector and test DT were sequentially connected. For the gas tubing short nylon pieces (RILSAN) were used. The length of the hose at the input was 1 m and at the output 1.5 m. The gas mixture was prepared beforehand by mixing the gas components in a pumped vessel. The quantity ofadmixture in Ar and CH\({}_{4}\) was less than 0.1% (specified by manufacturer). Only the purity of CO\({}_{2}\) was not known. Gas from the DT went out through bubbler with cleaned paraffin oil.

During the irradiation the anode currents were at least 100 times higher than those at expected ATLAS conditions. The gas flow was 6 cm\({}^{3}\)/min that is about 100 times higher than is proposed for the ATLAS muon system.

The normal gas gain for the DT is 2\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\). In fig.2 the dependence of the measured gas gain in our gas mixture on the count rate is shown. Working voltage was 3.2 kV, which corresponds to a gas gain of 5\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\) at a count rate 8\(\cdot\)10\({}^{3}\). Taking into account that during the irradiation the count rates were approximately 10\({}^{5}\) particles per centimeter of the wire, the real gas gain was about 10\({}^{4}\). At the begining of the irradiation the anode currents were 0.3 \(\mu\)A and 1 \(\mu\)A for tubes being irradiated by \({}^{204}\)Tl and \({}^{90}\)Sr respectively. The total deposited charges were computed by integrating the anode currents.

The ageing rate was determined as the relative reduction of the gas gain per unit of an accumulated charge. For measurements of the gas gain the irradiation was interrupted for short periods of time and spectra of signals from \({}^{55}\)Fe were measured using a current amplifier and an ADC (Lecroy 2249W). The \({}^{55}\)Fe was placed on reproducible positions at a fixed distances from the DT. The X-rays penetrated inside tubes through the special holes, where the wall have been made thin enough. To avoid an influence of uncontrolled changes in pressure, temperature, time drift of amplifier and ADC parameters, the amplitude spectra were measured in parallel at tested and control detectors. So the relative gas gain was defined as the ratio of 5.9 keV peak positions of the tested and control detectors. It is known that ageing manifests itself as a loss of an ability of a detector to tolerate high count rates /9/. Therefore the gas gain was measured at different count rates in the range from 0.4 up to 12 kHz/cm.

**Results**

Some indications of a performance degradation of the DT irradiated with high intensity had been observed after few days of irradiation. They had manifested as a visible widening of the main peak in the spectrum of \({}^{55}\)Fe at high count rates. The decreasing in the amplitude resolution can be seen in the fig.3, where the spectra of \({}^{55}\)Fe measured at 10 kHz before and after the irradiation are shown. At the end of the irradiation the form of the main peak had become asymmetrical. Because of this, the position of the main peak was determined as an average amplitude in the region of a maximum.

In fig.4 the relative gas gain for both tubes is plotted as function of a collected charge. The quantitative analysis of the results have been made since collected charge had reached 0.5 C/cm for the tube, which was irradiated by \({}^{204}\)Tl and 1.6 C/cm for tube, which was irradiated by \({}^{90}\)Sr. The fit of the results indicats a (7\(\pm\)1)%(cm/C) ageing rate for tube irradiated with higher intensity and (15\(\pm\)3)% (cm/C) for the other tube.

The additional indication of a slight DT degradation were Malter currents /10/. In fig.5 the dependences of the tube currents on the collected charge are shown. De spite large fluctuations in the measured currents due to uncontrolled pressure changes one can see that the currents tend to increase. We regard this as Malter effect. Malter dark currents refer to currents which slowly vanish after the radioactive source is removed. These currents can be extinguished by turning off the high voltage for a few seconds; however they return when stimulated by a strong source. All this features were observed if the radioactive sources have been removed or high voltage have been turned off for a short period of time. After removing of the source the dark current slowly decreased from 0.1 \(\mu\) to 0.02 \(\mu\), and after recovering of the high voltage without a radioactive source the current increased to 6\(\div\)9 nA. We have estimated the increase in dark currents to be 20% for both tubes at the end of the irradiation.

**Conclusions**

The first accelerated test of the DT ageing in laboratory conditions with Ar+5%CO\({}_{2}\)+3%CH\({}_{4}\) have shown a slow damage rate. After 20 days of continuous irradiation the rate of the decreasing of the relative gas gain for the tube which was irradiated with higher intensity was \(\frac{7\%}{C/cm}\). At that moment the total accumulated charge was 1.6 C/cm. For tube irradiated with lower intensity the ageing rate was \(\frac{15\%}{C/cm}\) after total accumulated charge 0.5 C/cm. Another type of DT damage was observed in both tubes. The Malter-type currents have increased the anode currents on 20% to the end of the test. In addition slightly faster degradation in amplitude resolution have been observed during DT test with \({}^{55}\)Fe in case of higher count rates.

Since the dependence of ageing rate on current density in DT have been observed, it is important to determine more accurately the relationship between current density and damage rate. It should then be possible to project the results of the ageing test the ATLAS conditions.
