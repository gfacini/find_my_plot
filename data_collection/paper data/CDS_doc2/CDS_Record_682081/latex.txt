The ASCOT/EAGLE muon spectrometer will be built into a cylindrical toroidal magnet with end-caps that have equally toroidal fields. Wire chambers will measure the curvature of high-momentum muons with a typical accuracy of 100 \(\mu\)m in each of the'superlayers' of which there are typically four or six in the various existing designs.

Whatever the final construction -- iron core or air core magnet, honeycomb chambers or framed drift chambers or cylindrical drift tubes -- the quoted measurement accuracy can be fully employed for the determination of muon momenta only if the chamber positions are known to a precision which is much better than 100 \(\mu\)m.

In this note we describe a technical solution to this problem. It was originally designed for an air core magnet. If used in an iron-core magnet, numerous unobstructed optical light-paths must be providid across the iron.

2. Distinction between three classes of alignment

The (flat, rectangular) muon chambers are supposed to be only so large that in each one of them the measuring geometry is well under control with respect to certain external reference marks which they carry in their four corners.

Now we distinguish three classes of relative positions of muon chambers, and to each there corresponds a different kind of alignment. There are first the relative positions of those chambers that contribute to the momentum determination of the same high-energy muon, these concern chambers in projective geometry relative to the interaction point. In order to achieve good spectrometer resolution, their relative positions must be most accurately known (say to better than 50 \(\mu\)m), but only in the bending direction. It is for them that our alignment system is intended.

All the other relative positions between muon chambers are in a second category; they are important for the measurement of angles between tracks. The angular accuracy that makes the same contribution to the error of a typical particle mass as the one from the momentum accuracy does requires an alignment to a few mm. Here the positions of chambers must be described in a more complete way and in an over-all coordinate system, albeit less accurately than they have to be in class 1.

Finally we mention a third class of geometrical relations of muon chambers, those to the other detectors in the experiment. Methods of muon track fitting through several layers of detectors will become important for them.

3 Principle of alignment of several chambers that will measure the same high-momentum muon Chambers are cut to form projective towers so that their corners fall on straight lines pointing to the interaction vertex. The corners carry the reference marks which define the coordinates in each chamber. Ideally lying on these straight lines, the reference marks are in practice displaced by small amounts. Optical elements in the corners are equipped to measure the position of each reference mark with respect to a laser beam pointing to the interaction vertex. The optical elements are transparent to a degree that four or six of them (as many as there are superlayers) can be traversed by the light-beam. In order to define the method in which these reference mark positions are going to be used, we imagine the simple case of three chambers in projective positions as shown in Fig. 1. In cylindrical coordinates r, \(\theta\), \(\phi\), let the three chambers be positioned at three different \(\tau_{k}\) (k=1,2,3) and be limited by common boundaries \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\), \(\phi_{1}\), and \(\phi_{2}\). Reference mark positions

Figure 1: Alignment of three projective chamber planes using four laser rays pointing to the interaction point (I.P.).

tions \(z_{ik}\) (i = 1,.., 4, k = 1,2,3 ) are assumed to be measured in each corner of the three chambers in the 'bending plane' \(\phi\) = const.. For each of the four laser rays we define an 'apparent sagitta'

\[s_{i}=\frac{z_{i3}+z_{i1}}{2}\ -\ z_{i2} \tag{1}\]

A high-momentum muon is characterized by a pair of values (\(\theta\),\(\phi\))\({}_{\mu}\), whereas the four reference marks are at (\(\theta\),\(\phi\))\({}_{i}\) (i = 1,..,4). According to our method, the measured value \(s_{\mu}\)\({}^{\text{meas}}\) of the sagitta measurement is to be corrected by the following formula:

\[s_{\mu}^{\text{true}}\ =\ s_{\mu}^{\text{meas}}\ -\ f\left(\left(\theta,\phi \right)_{i},\ s_{i},\ (i=1,..,4);\ \left(\theta,\phi\right)_{\mu}\right) \tag{2}\]

where f is the linear interpolation function of (\(\theta\),\(\phi\))\({}_{\mu}\) that assumes the values s\({}_{i}\) at (\(\theta\),\(\phi\))\({}_{\mu}\) = (\(\theta\),\(\phi\))\({}_{i}\) (i = 1,..,4).

In a more complicated geometry and where the magnet is inhomogeneous, the method has to be generalized. Instead of the simple sagitta-measurement there will be a track fit to a parametric form depending on the particle momentum. In the four corners, the true inverse'momentum' of the laser beams has to be zero, by construction. For a high-momentum muon at some angular position (\(\theta\),\(\phi\))\({}_{\mu}\), the true inverse momentum is obtained from the measured one by subtracting the corresponding interpolation function that assumes the values of the measured inverse'momenta' at the four corner points.

## 4 Properties of formula (2)

It is obvious from the construction of Equ. (2) that it corrects for all linear coordinate transformations in the three planes. These include displacements and small rotations (to first order in the rotation angles) as they may arise from mounting the chambers in positions known only to a few mm. Equ. (2) also removes changes in scale which may result from alterations in temperature of one full chamber. In contrast, Equ. (2) does not remove non-linear coordinate transformations. An example is the gravitational sag of a chamber between its corners, which changes the sagitta in the centre of the chamber in first order of the sag, multiplied by a function of the polar angle \(\theta\). Any other deformation of a chamber out of its plane has a similar effect.

Another example is the inhomogeneous heating of a chamber that results in a temperature gradient between the corners.

## 5 The optical detection elements

Following the experience obtained with silicon strip vertex detectors for charged particles, the technology of precise carrier implantation into silicon crystals was chosen for the production of the optical elements.

A schematic diagram is seen in Fig. 2. Photosensitive strips, 300 \(\upmu\)m wide and 20 mm long, fill a sensitive region of 20 mm x 20 mm. Photocurrents are created in 6 or 10 of these strips when the laser ray hits the surface because the diameter of the beam measures 2 or 3 mm. The photocurrents are read out on both sides so that the electronics is situated symmetrically like wings attached to the sides of the silicon crystal. Reference marks, which are located with \(\upmu\)m-accuracy in relation to the (invisible) strips, make it possible to position the crystal into the base plate of a muon chamber superlayer.

The coordinate mesurement in the direction across the strips is the most precise. Based on an accuracy of 2% in the determination of the photocurrent in one strip, the intrinsic precision in the measurement of the centre of the laser beam is estimated to be \(\pm\) 15 \(\upmu\)m, resulting from a fit to the Gaussian distribution of the light-intensity.

The coordinate measurement in the direction of the strips is based on a comparison of the two photocurrents on both sides. Here the accuray is estimated to be of the order of \(\pm\) 0.5 mm.

Known difficulties with these detectors originate from any non-ideal shape of the silicon crystal and from a possible systematic variation of sensitivity across the surface. These effects can be measured for each individual detector and can be corrected for.

Figure 2: Geometrical arrangement of the silicon strip optical detector.

A wedge angle \(\varepsilon\) (compare Fig. 3 a) gives a kink \(\delta\) to the light-ray which is of the same order of magnitude as \(\varepsilon\) and depends weakly on the angle \(\alpha\) the beam has with the silicon surface.

The thickness d (compare Fig. 3 b) of the silicon plate causes a displacement b of the same order of magnitude as d; b depends strongly on \(\alpha\).

A systematic non-uniformity of response across the strips causes a displacement of the calculated centre of the beam spot, which can be shown to be in lowest order equal to

\[\delta y\,=\,S^{2}\,/\,X \tag{3}\]

where S is the r.m.s. beam width and X characterizes the small non-uniformity \(\Delta\)P of the signal P in the form \(\Delta\)P/P = y/X; X is much larger than the linear dimensions of the detector.

## 6 Laser wave length and detector thickness

The wave length \(\lambda\) must be chosen such that the silicon plates are sufficiently transparent. In Fig. 4 we see the measurements by Dash and Newman [1] of light-absorption coefficients in silicon as a function of the photon energy E\({}_{\nu}\). Characteristic is the sharp decrease below E\({}_{\nu}\) = 1.2 eV, at 300 K. An absorption coefficient of 1 / cm (corresponding to 3% / 300 \(\mu\)m for a commercial standard thickness of silicon) would be ideal. It is reached at E\({}_{\nu}\) = 1.1 eV (\(\lambda\) = 1.12 \(\mu\)m). A suitable laser emission line in the vicinity exists at \(\lambda\) = 1.064 \(\mu\)m, in the well

proven Nd:YAG lasers. For this wave length the absorption in silicon is 20 / cm (or 60% / 300 \(\mu\)m).

In the interest of a homogeneous response of all the four or six silicon plates to be traversed by one laser beam, one would like to either make the detector thinner, say 50 \(\mu\)m (the corresponding absorption being 10% / 50 \(\mu\)m), or to find a better laser at slightly increased wave length.

## 7 Beam- and fibre-optics

A diffraction limited light-beam that is focussed at one point x along its path to a diameter W\({}_{\mathbf{x}}\) (the size of the 'waist') will become larger at some distance D away from the waist, according to the approximate formula

\[\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{D}}^{2}=\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{x}}^{2}+\left(\frac{\lambda \mathrm{D}}{\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{x}}}\right)^{2}\ \ \, \tag{4}\]

\(\lambda=1.06\ \mathrm{\mu m}\) being the wave length.

Since the measuring stations can be apart from each other as much as 8 m in the spectrometer, we optimize the size W\({}_{\mathbf{x}}\) of the waist by minimizing the quadratic sum of the diameters of three light-spots, one at the centre and two 4 m away on either side:

\[\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{4m}}^{2}+\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{x}}^{2}+\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{ 4m}}^{2}=\mathrm{3W}_{\mathrm{x}}^{2}+2\left(\frac{1\ \mathrm{\mu m}\ \mathrm{4\ m}}{\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{x}}}\right)^{2}\ \mathrm{to\ min.} \tag{5}\]

One finds

\[\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{x}}=\mathrm{2\ mm,\ \ W}_{\mathrm{D}}=\mathrm{3\ mm.}\]

Laser light is transportable in optical fibres. For a wave length around 1 \(\mathrm{\mu m}\), a mono-mode fibre is available which has a core diameter of 6.7 \(\mathrm{\mu m}\) and a numerical aperture of 0.11.We propose to transport the laser light in fibres attached to the outside of the spectrometer. Many fibres can be fed from the same laser using beam splitting techniques. For the creation of a suitable diffraction-limited ray at the output end of the fibre one needs a coupler \(-\) a lens or lens system to produce a focus (waist) in the centre of the spectrometer (see Fig. 5). This is a prefereable position for the waist because it minimizes the size of the light-spots.

The production and and adjustment of such couplers requires very accurate and stable mechanics, partly below the tolerance of 1 \(\upmu\)m.

## 8 Full scale alignment milestone in 2 dimensions

Three girders, 2.5 m apart (see Fig. 6), the longest 2 m long, the shortest 1 m long, are aligned with the help of two laser rays traversing optical detectors at the ends of the girders. A third laser ray through detectors in the centres of the three girders represents 'the muon'. The purpose of the milestone is to demonstrate that the sagitta of the muon can be predicted even when displacing, rotating or heating one of the girders. They have to be straight.
