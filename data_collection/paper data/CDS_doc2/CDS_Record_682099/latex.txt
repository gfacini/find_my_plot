###### Abstract

High voltage is distributed to the pads of the readout electrodes of the ATLAS e.m. calorimeter through silk screened resistors. Their resistance values are defined as a compromise between different requirements such as preamplifier protection and minimisation of cross-talk and voltage drop induced by minimum bias events.

Experience with electrode prototypes has shown that, with the sergiraphic technique, deviations of resistance values from the nominal ones can take place.

In this note an analytic calculation is developed to understand how far one can go from nominal resistance values without degrading the calorimeter performance.

The results of this note can be used to define acceptance criteria for the final production of the readout electrodes.

## 1 Contents

Section 2 presents an analytic calculation of the energy deposited in the calorimeter by minimum bias events. A comparison is also made with two Monte Carlo results.

In section 3 the current expected per high voltage channel is calculated.

Section 4 introduces a simplified model of the readout electrodes to treat analytically the effect of high resistor values on the calorimeter performance, which are eventually discussed in section 5.

## 2 Deposited energy

I assume all the particles produced in the pp interaction to be pions, 2/3 of which are charged and 1/3 are neutral: charged and neutral pions are assumed to have the same \(\overline{p}_{T}\)1.

Footnote 1: The quantities used in this note are defined in the appendix

Since neutral pions decay to two photons, the particle density for charged and neutral particles is the same, with the neutral particles having half \(\overline{p}_{T}\) of the charged ones.

Instead of using the full \(p_{T}\) distribution I assume [1] all the particles to have

\[p_{T}=\overline{p}_{T}, \tag{1}\]

which means that at a given \(\eta\) all charged pions will have energy

\[\overline{E}=\frac{\overline{p}_{T}}{sin\theta}. \tag{2}\]

I assume that, in the angular range of the e.m. calorimeters, particles are uniformly distributed in pseudorapidity and

* \((\overline{p}_{T})_{\pi}=0.6\) GeV/c
* \(\frac{dN}{d\eta}=7.4\)

where N is the number of charged particles.

I also assume that neutral particles deposit all their energy in the e.m. calorimeter. This is a pessimistic assumption because some energy is lost in the material in front of the calorimeter (including presampler) and shower leakage is neglected.

Due to their low energy (at the smallest angle \(\overline{E}=7.5\ GeV\)), the charged pions will be assumed to deposit 50% of their energy in the e.m. calorimeter (see also [2] ).

In terms of deposited energy it is therefore expected that neutral and charged pions give the same contribution.

The energy deposited in a calorimeter region between \(\eta_{1}\) and \(\eta_{2}\) per minimum bias event 2 is

Footnote 2: All calculations refer to half detector, i.e. \(\eta>0\).

\[E_{\it event}=\int_{\eta_{1}}^{\eta_{2}}2\cdot\frac{dN}{d\eta}\cdot\vec{E} \cdot d\eta=2\cdot\frac{dN}{d\eta}\cdot\overline{p}_{T}\cdot(\frac{1}{tan \theta_{2}}-\frac{1}{tan\theta_{1}}) \tag{3}\]

Figure 1 shows the energy deposited in the e.m. calorimeter per minimum bias event as a function of \(\eta\), integrated over the azimuthal angle. The \(\eta\) bin size corresponds to the H.V. channel segmentation of the final electrode design.

The white dots are the result of the above calculation, the black stars of the FLUKA Monte Carlo [3] simulation and the the black dots of a Monte Carlo simulation reported in [4].

The power deposited in the calorimeter is

\[P_{R}={\cal L}\cdot\sigma\cdot E_{\it event} \tag{4}\]

Assuming* \(\sigma=80\) mb at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV
* \({\cal L}=10^{34}\) Hz/cm

it is obtained

\[P_{R}=(\frac{1}{tan\theta_{2}}-\frac{1}{tan\theta_{1}})\cdot 0.57\ W \tag{5}\]

Being the \(\eta\) coverage of the e.m. barrel calorimeter 0-1.4 and that of the end-cap 1.4-3.2, the total power is:

\[P_{R}^{barrel} = 1\ W\] \[P_{R}^{\mbox{\tiny{$\eta\in d-exp$}}} = 6\ W \tag{6}\]

## 3 Direct current

The following values were assumed:

* \(W=25\) eV
* for the product \(f(\theta)\cdot K\) the estimate of [5] for the end-cap region and a calculation from data of tables 1-1 and 10-18 of the TDR for the barrel region.

The ionisation rate is given by

\[D=P_{R}\cdot f(\theta)\cdot K\cdot\frac{1}{W} \tag{7}\]

The direct current of electrons and ions produced by ionisation is

\[I=D\cdot e \tag{8}\]

The current per H.V. channel is shown in figure 2. A \(\phi\) segmentation of 64 (32 \(\phi\) subdivision and independent up and down feed of each electrode) was assumed, as proposed in the calorimeter TDR, table 10-173.

The total current in the calorimeter is

Footnote 3: A further splitting of the channels corresponding to the two innermost \(\eta\) segments was recently proposed

\[I^{barrel} = \sum_{H.V.channels}I_{i}=8mA\] \[I^{\mbox{\tiny{$\epsilon\,\mbox{\tiny{$\eta\in d-exp$}}}$}} = \sum_{H.V.channels}I_{i}=32mA \tag{9}\]

while the total dissipated power by the Joule effect is

\[P_{J}^{barrel} = \sum_{H.V.channels}I_{i}\cdot V_{i}=16W\] \[P_{J}^{\mbox{\tiny{$\epsilon\,\mbox{\tiny{$\eta\in d-exp$}}}$}} = \sum_{H.V.channels}I_{i}\cdot V_{i}=60W \tag{10}\]This power, which is mainly 4 dissipated in the liquid Argon, will contribute to heat the liquid up.

It is interesting, though not unexpected, that for the e.m. calorimeter the power \(P_{J}\) dissipated by the Joule effect in the liquid Argon is larger than the power \(P_{R}\) deposited by the particles, opposite to what happens in the e.m. section of the FCAL [1].

It is worth mentioning that the calculation of the present note gives currents smaller by a factor 2 than those derived by the authors of [4], where a factor 2 is inserted in formula (8). Formula (8) follows from the argument of [6].

Footnote 4: It is easily calculated that, for nominal resistance values of the silk screened resistors, the power dissipated in the resistors is at least two orders of magnitude less than that dissipated in the liquid Argon

## 4 Electrode model

The direct current induced by minimum bias events will flow across the resistors of the electrode H.V. layer and, depending on resistance values (at liquid Argon temperature), produce a voltage drop across them.

The H.V. electrode is designed so that the cells of the second sampling are fed in parallel both through the third sampling and from the high voltage line directly. For the calculation of the voltage drop I will neglect the third sampling: my conclusions will then be a little pessimistic. With this approximation, the electrode can be modeled as a two sampling device, with parallel rows running along r, where r is the radial distance from the interaction point.

For \(|\eta|<2.5\) the first sampling (about \(4.5\;X_{0}\) at \(\eta=0\)) in a row is subdivided into 8 strips, which are individually connected (i.e. in parallel) to the second sampling (about \(18\;X_{0}\) at \(\eta=0\)) with silk screened resistors. To protect preamplifiers from accidental sparks in the liquid Argon the rows of the second sampling are segmented in pads connected (in series) by resistors and the last pad is connected to the H.V. line by two resistors in parallel. For \(|\eta|>2.5\) there is no strip section and the first sampling has the same structure of the second sampling of the other \(\eta\) region.

In the following calculation the nominal resistance values are as in table 1 and are approximations of their design values [7].

The energy deposition in the calorimeter was modeled as in section 2 with few more assumptions.

The maximum photon energy is about \(3.5\) GeV. At this low energy I assume that most of the e.m. energy will be released in the first sampling. The current flowing across the resistors of the H.V. layer, \(i_{e}\), is then constant along r.

The hadronic energy, instead, was assumed to be deposited uniformly along r (see for instance [8]). The corresponding current flowing across the resistors, \(i_{h}=i_{e}\), is then linearly increasing with r.

Following this naive model, the current flowing across the resistors connecting the first to the second sampling is about

\[i_{first}=1/8(i_{e}+0.25\cdot i_{h})=0.08i_{tot}. \tag{11}\]

where \(i_{tot}=i_{e}+i_{h}\).

Across the resistors of the second sampling the current is

\[i_{k}=i_{\epsilon}+0.25i_{h}+0.75/n\cdot k\cdot i_{h}, \tag{12}\]

where \(k\) is the pad number (increasing with r) and \(n\) the total number of pads. The voltage drop across each resistor of a row, with respect to the next one, is an increasing function of r, being maximum across the resistor closest to the H.V. line, where the current is \(i_{tot}\).

The total voltage drop (i.e. with respect to the nominal voltage) at resistor \(m\) of the second sampling is

\[(\Delta V)^{m}_{tot}=\sum_{k=m}^{n-1}R_{2}i_{k}+R_{P}\cdot i_{tot} \tag{13}\]

where \(R_{2}\) is the resistance value of the resistive pads of the second sampling and \(R_{P}\) of those connecting the last pad of the second sampling to the high voltage line.

At the first pad of the second sampling

\[(\Delta V)^{1}_{tot}\thicksim(0.85(n-1)R_{2}+R_{P})\cdot i_{tot} \tag{14}\]

and in the first sampling

\[(\Delta V)^{0}_{tot}\thicksim(0.08R_{1}+0.85(n-1)R_{2}+R_{P})\cdot i_{tot} \tag{15}\]

where \(R_{1}\) is the resistor connecting the first to the second sampling. For simplicity the above expression can be approximated to

\[(\Delta V)^{0}_{tot}\thicksim(0.1R_{1}+(n-1)R_{2}+R_{P})\cdot i_{tot}=R_{tff} \cdot i_{tot} \tag{16}\]

## 5 Signal loss and resistor values

### Upper limits on resistance values

With fast shaping (peaking time of the signal much shorter than the drift time) the output signal is sensitive to the initial current

\[s\propto I_{o}=\frac{Q}{t_{{}_{d}}}\propto\frac{QV^{0.3}}{d^{1.3}} \tag{17}\]

where Q is the ionisation charge released in the sensitive medium, \(V\) the voltage applied and \(d\) the gap width.

The initial current, with a high voltage drop \(\Delta V\), is reduced, for small \(\Delta V\), by a factor

\[\frac{\Delta I_{o}}{I_{{}_{o}}}=0.33\frac{\Delta V}{V}. \tag{18}\]

The actual signal loss for showers is given by:

\[\frac{\Delta s}{s}=0.33\frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n}{(\Delta V)^{i}_{tot}\cdot f^{i}}} {V} \tag{19}\](the factor 0.33 becomes 0.31 once the full signal shape after shaping is taken into account) where \(m\) is the total number of pads in a row and \(f^{i}\) the energy fraction deposited at a depth corresponding to the \(i\)-th pad.

The largest signal loss is when all the energy is deposited in the first sampling, i.e. for very low energy showers. In this case

\[\frac{ds}{s}\sim 0.33\frac{(\Delta V)_{tot}^{0}}{V} \tag{20}\]

The maximum tolerable signal loss was defined by comparison with the other systematic effects contributing to the constant term of the energy resolution: being the main contributions of the order 0.2%, it was required

\[\frac{\Delta s}{s}<0.1\% \tag{21}\]

Figure 3 shows (white symbols) the maximum value for the total effective resistance \(R_{eff}\)5 in an electrode row compatible with the requirement of (21). It is seen that the requirements on the resistance values become tighter at large \(\eta\). The sudden drop at the beginning of the end-cap inner wheel is due to both higher current and smaller number of electrodes. In the same figure black symbols represent \(R_{eff}\) with nominal resistance values.

Footnote 5: \(R_{eff}\) can be easily calculated from the individually measured resistance values.

Figure 4 shows the signal loss that one expects with resistors of nominal value.

Due to the serigraphic technique used for the resistors, quite a large spread of resistance values around the nominal ones is expected. The above resistance limits are therefore meant to apply to the mean values of the resistance distributions. Non symmetric distributions could partly modify the above conclusions.

### Examples with resistance distributions of electrode prototypes

The resistors of a few ATLAS electrode prototypes [9], on which the same resistive ink [10] of the final electrodes was applied, were measured.

It is interesting to calculate what the signal loss would be if the resistor quality of these prototypes were the same as that of final electrodes.

To do this, the measured resistance distributions of first and second sampling resistors of two prototypes were used as input for the calculation of the signal drop 6.

Footnote 6: Variation of resistance values between room and liquid Argon temperature is neglected here

The two measured distributions were analytically reproduced by superimposing three gaussians with the same mean value (the nominal resistance value of electrode prototypes) but different r.m.s., and are shown in figure 5. The gaussians are truncated on the lower side at 20% of the nominal value; this lower limit was found to be valid for all the measured ATLAS electrode prototypes. The resistance values extend up to 100 \(M\Omega\) (though it is not shown in the figure), which is the upper limit of the meter range.

The probability distributions for the resist ance values of the final calorimeter electrodes were then generated rescaling the mean resistance values to the nominal values of the final electrodes (see table 1).

To estimate the effect on e.m. showers the following model was used: the energy of a shower was assumed to be deposited in one calorimeter cell 7; the total signal was then obtained adding the signals of first and second sampling together. For each \(\eta\) row all the resistor values were generated according to the above mentioned and the total voltage drop calculated. Then the signal drop on a shower was calculated as an average on 8 half-gaps in \(\phi\).

Footnote 7: This approximation corresponds to assume fully correlated resistance values among the cells hit by the shower

Figure 6 shows, for the resistance distribution corresponding to electrode prototype a) the average signal drop as a function of \(\eta\) (1) and the r.m.s. in the case of fully uncorrelated resistance value generation (2).

In some cases, the measured electrode prototypes showed some degree of spatial correlation of the resistance values, probably depending both on production process and on electrode manipulation. It is of course not possible to know _a priori_ what kind of correlation will be present in the final electrodes; however to estimate the impact of such an effect, fully correlated resistance values were assumed in the second sampling of each electrode (though they were assumed to be different from electrode to electrode). It turned out that the mean value of the signal loss distribution is not affected, but the r.m.s., as shown in figure 6, became larger than in the uncorrelated case.

Figure 7 shows the same quantities for the resistance values corresponding to the electrode prototype b).

From these figures it is seen that, for \(\eta<2.5\), only the resistance distribution of electrode a) leads to mean values of the signal loss larger than tolerable. For \(\eta>2.5\) both distributions lead to signal losses of the order of a few percent. It should be however remembered that only the region \(\eta<2.5\) is meant to be used for precision e.m. measurements.

A large signal drop will eventually require the development of a complicated correction function for the deposited energy as a function of \(\eta\) and of the luminosity based on a full detector simulation which takes into account the data-base of measured resistance values.

## 6 Conclusions

An analytic calculation was developed to estimate the signal drop induced by minimum bias events as a function of resistance values of the resistive pads of the high voltage layer of readout electrodes.

Upper limits on resistance values were then defined as a function of \(\eta\) and can be used to define acceptance criteria for the final production of the electrodes.
