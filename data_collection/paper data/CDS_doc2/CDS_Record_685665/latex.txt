## 1 Introduction

The operation of LHC at high luminosity leads to huge fluxes of secondary particles. Fig.1 shows the densities of the energy and particle fluxes at the surface of the ATLAS end-cap calorimeter as a function of the distance r from the beam line. These data were obtained with the help of the Monte Carlo program PYTHIA [1] and they correspond to the luminosity \(2.5\cdot 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The densities rise rapidly with the decrease of r and at the inner radius of the calorimeter (r\({}_{1}\)=30 cm) the density of the energy flux reaches \(15\cdot 10^{6}\) GeV/cm\({}^{2}\) per second. It leads to very large ionization rates in the sensitive medium of the end-cap LAr calorimeters and, in principle, can give rise to the following problems. Firstly, leakage currents in the high resistive layer (HRL) covering surfaces of a readout board can cause sizable voltage drop in the regions which are distant from high voltage inputs. Secondly, considerable positive space charge can be accumulated in the LAr gaps. Both these effects can lead to the nonuniformity of the electric field in the gap and consequently to the distortion of the triangle time dependence of the ionization current through the gap. In particular, the maximal value of the induced current I\({}_{max}\), which is used as a measure of the deposited energy, can degrade. The aim of this note is to estimate these effects for the ATLAS end-cap LAr hadron calorimeter.

## 2 Calculation of the ionization rates

To calculate the ionization rates in the liquid argon gaps we used 2000 minimum biased events simulated by the program PYTHIA. The geometry used for these calculations is a simplified approximation of the actual design of the ATLAS LAr hadron calorimeter. It is taken that a single absorber element (ABE) consists of a 25 mm copper plate and a double gap of 2*4.0 mm LAr with a readout board in the centre. The hadron calorimeter has the form of a wheel with inner radius \(r_{1}\)=30 cm and outer radius \(r_{2}\)=180 cm which is perpendicular to the beam axis. The distance from the interaction point is equal to 435 cm. Two possible end-cap calorimeter setups are considered. The first one (setup A) is with preceding electromagnetic calorimeter and the second one (setup B) without it. The setup B can presumably take place at the first stage of LHC operation. Also the option when a forward calorimeter is integrated with the end-cap is considered. In this case the inner radius \(r_{1}\) is reduced from 30 cm to 7 cm and this inner part (7-30 cm) is treated as a passive absorber. Since the energy leakage out of the proposed tungsten forward calorimeter would be considerably less than in this simplified description, we obtain somewhat overestimated ion rates at r=30 cm.

Similar to our previous paper [2], we do not generate full e.m. and hadron showers, as it is made for example in GEANT, because for our purposes it is sufficient to use the averaged description of showers parametrized according to ref. [3]. Shower origins are generated according to an exponential distribution. To estimate the energy deposited in a cell, the longitudinal and lateral profiles of all nearby showers (\(\pm 1.5R_{M}\) or \(\pm 1.5\lambda\)) are integrated over the cell volume. Only a small fraction of the deposited energy ( 4.2% for the hadron calorimeter) is released in the sensitive volume. To estimate the number of created electron-ion pairs this energy is divided by 23 eV, needed to produce the pair in liquid argon. The mean density of the current, created by the electrons coming to HRL, is equal to the mean number of the electron-ion pairs created in a unit volume per a second, multiplied with a LAr gap width \(a\). Fig. 2 shows the dependence of this current density on the position of a LAr gap along the depth of the hadron calorimeter. In the case of a single hadron calorimeter (setup B) the maximum of the current density is reached at about 5th gap, and the other case (setup A) in the first one. To estimate the dependence of the current on radius we used later on only these two gaps.

Fig. 3 shows these dependences for both setups.

## 3 Estimates of voltage drop in HRL

The distribution of the potential U in HRL is described by the differential equation

\[\Delta U+\rho\cdot j(t)=\rho c\frac{\partial U}{\partial t},\]

where \(\Delta\) is the Laplacian, j(t) is the density of the current in an argon gap, \(\rho\) is the resistivity of HRL (\(\sim 1\)M\(\Omega\)) and c is its capacitance,

\[c=\varepsilon/d,\]

where d is the thickness of the insulator layer between the HRL and the signal pads. If d is equal to 50 \(\mu\)m and \(\varepsilon=1.5\cdot\varepsilon_{0}\), then \(c\simeq\)25 pF/cm\({}^{2}\). The time scale of processes in HRL is defined by its geometrical dimensions and by the constant \(\rho\)c\(\simeq\)25\(\mu\)s/cm\({}^{2}\). It is obvious from the comparison of this time scale and the flux densities shown in Fig.1 that U is the result of superposition of a large number of showers and any single shower cannot noticeably change the value of U. So eq. (1) can be averaged over time:

\[\Delta U+\rho j=0,\]

where j is averaged over time too.

If HRL has the shape of a ring (or of any of its segment) with inner and outer radii r\({}_{1}\) and r\({}_{2}\), respectively, the solution of eq. (3) is quite simple due to azimuthal symmetry.

a) If high voltage (HV) V\({}_{0}\) is applied at the outer edge (\(r=r_{2}\)), then

\[U(r)=V_{0}-\rho\int_{r}^{r_{2}}I(r)\frac{dr}{r};\qquad I(r)=\int_{r_{1}}^{r}j( r)rdr\]

b) If HV is applied at the inner edge (\(r=r_{1}\)), then

\[U(r)=V_{0}-\rho\int_{r_{1}}^{r}I(r)\frac{dr}{r};\qquad I(r)=\int_{r}^{r_{2}}j( r)rdr\]

c) If HV is applied at both inner and outer edges, then

\[U_{1}(r)=V_{0}-\rho\int_{r_{1}}^{r}I(r)\frac{dr}{r};\qquad I(r)=\int_{r}^{r_{0} }j(r)rdr\qquad r<r_{0}\]\[U_{2}(r)=V_{0}-\rho\int_{r}^{r_{2}}I(r)\frac{dr}{r};\qquad I(r)=\int_{r_{0}}^{r}j(r )rdr\qquad r>r_{0}\]

and r\({}_{0}\) can be found from the condition U\({}_{1}\)(r\({}_{0}\))=U\({}_{2}\)(r\({}_{0}\)).

Provided j(r) can be parametrized with a simple power dependence

\[j(r)=j_{0}\left(\frac{r_{1}}{r}\right)^{n}, \tag{5}\]

one obtains the following analytical expressions of the maximal voltage drop for the three cases, considered above:

\[\Delta U=\rho j_{0}\frac{r_{1}^{2}}{2-n}\left\{\frac{1}{2-n}\left[\left(\frac{ r_{2}}{r_{1}}\right)^{2-n}-1\right]-\ln\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}\right\}, \tag{6a}\]

\[\Delta U=\rho j_{0}\frac{r_{1}^{2}}{2-n}\left\{\left(\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}} \right)^{2-n}\ln\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{2-n}\left[\left(\frac{r_{2}}{r_{ 1}}\right)^{2-n}-1\right]\right\}, \tag{6b}\]

\[\Delta U=\rho j_{0}\frac{r_{1}^{2}}{2-n}\left\{\left(\frac{r_{0}}{r_{1}} \right)^{2-n}\ln\frac{r_{0}}{r_{1}}-\frac{1}{2-n}\left[\left(\frac{r_{0}}{r_{ 1}}\right)^{2-n}-1\right]\right\}, \tag{6c}\]

\[\left(\frac{r_{0}}{r_{1}}\right)^{2-n}=\left[\left(\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}\right) ^{2-n}-1\right]/(2-n)/\ln\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}.\]

To illustrate the scale of the possible voltage drop we consider the case with uniform current density. So, if j=j\({}_{0}\)=const (n=0), r\({}_{1}\)=30cm, r\({}_{2}\)=180cm then \(\Delta U/j_{0}=\alpha=\)7.1, 21.2 and 3.0 [V/(nA/cm\({}^{2}\))], correspondingly.

The real current density is a rapidly decreasing function of r (Fig. 3) and it can be roughly approximated by expression (5) with parameters n=4 and 3 and j\({}_{0}\)=25 and 310 [nA/cm\({}^{2}\)] for setups A and B, respectively. The substitution of these parameters into eq. (6a-b) brings:

\(\alpha=\)0.6, 0.2 and 0.08 [V/(nA/cm\({}^{2}\))] and \(\Delta U=\)14.7, 4.9 and 2.1 [V] for the setup A,

\(\alpha=\)0.9, 0.5 and 0.16 [V/(nA/cm\({}^{2}\))] and \(\Delta U=\)267, 149 and 50 [V] for the setup B.

I\({}_{max}\) is proportional to the drift velocity of electrons v\({}_{-}\), which can be approximated by the expression

\[v_{-}=v_{-}^{0}+\beta(E-E_{0}) \tag{7}\]where \(v_{-}^{0}\)=3.5[\(\mu m\)/ns], \(\beta\)=0.15[(\(\mu m\)/ns)/(kV/mm)] at E\({}_{0}\)=1 [kV/mm]. This rough approximation is made using the data from fig.2 in ref. [4]. So the relative change of the maximal current will be equal to

\[\Delta I_{max}/I_{max}=\frac{\beta}{v_{-}^{0}}\cdot\frac{\Delta U}{a}=0.043 \cdot\frac{\Delta U}{a} \tag{8}\]

For example, if \(\Delta U=\)100 V, then corresponding \(\Delta I_{max}/I_{max}\simeq\)0.1%.

## 4 Estimation of ion loading effects

The problem of ion loading in liquid ionization calorimeters is discussed in details by Rutherford in [5]. It is shown there that the degradation of the signal due to accumulated space charge occurs if the value of positive ion charge \(D\), created in the unit of sensitive volume per a second, exceeds some critical value \(D_{c}\)

\[D_{c}=4V_{0}^{2}\varepsilon\mu_{+}/a^{4}, \tag{9}\]

where \(V_{0}\) is the potential applied across the gap, \(a\) is the gap width, \(\varepsilon\) is the permittivity in the sampling medium, \(\mu_{+}\) is the ion mobility.

The conclusion that signal does not degrade, if \(R=D/D_{c}<1\), implies that the signal is total collected electron charge. But if one use \(I_{max}\) as a measure of signal, the distortion of signal can take place at lower \(R\) due to the nonuniformity of electric field.

Provided the ionization produced by a shower is uniform throughout the gap

\[I_{max}\sim\int_{0}^{a}v_{-}dz, \tag{10}\]

and if one uses linear approximation (7) then

\[\Delta I_{max}\sim\int_{0}^{a}(E-\frac{V_{0}}{a})dz \tag{11}\]

It can be readily seen that the integral in eq. (11) is exactly equal to zero, because \(\int_{0}^{a}Edz=V_{0}\) at any \(R\). So, I\({}_{max}\) does not degrade, if approximation (7) holds. The last condition takes place with sufficient accuracy if \(\Delta E/E<\)0.3-0.4, which corresponds to \(R\) approximately less then 0.4. Probably \(I_{max}\) does not degrade noticeably even at higher \(R\), but to prove this it is necessary to undertake a more careful study.

To estimate \(D_{\rm c}\) we used the following values of parameters: \(V_{0}/a\)=1kV/mm, \(\varepsilon=1.5\varepsilon_{0}\), \(a\)=4mm and \(\mu_{+}\)=0.06 mm\({}^{2}\)/(V\(\cdot\)s). It brings

\[D_{\rm c}=200[nA/cm^{3}] \tag{12}\]

\(D\) is connected with the current density, shown in Fig. 3, by a simple relation

\[j=a\cdot D \tag{13}\]

So, \(D_{max}\simeq 60\) [nA/cm\({}^{3}\)] for setup A, and \(D_{max}\simeq 800\) [nA/cm\({}^{3}\)] for setup B.

## 5 Conclusions

1. For setup A. a) The maximal voltage drop, which is reached in the first gap of the calorimeter at r=30 cm, amounts to 14.7 V, when the simplest way of HV input is used. Corresponding \(\Delta I_{max}/I_{max}\) is equal to 0.016%. b) \(R_{max}=D_{max}/D_{\rm c}\) is equal to \(\sim\) 0.3. These values are somewhat overestimated, as was mentioned in Sect. 2, even for the case of integrated forward calorimeter. They will be considerably smaller, if the forward calorimeter will be placed separately. So, our conclusion is that neither voltage drop in the HRL nor space charge accumulated in the LAr gaps will spoil the hadron calorimeter performance for setup A at the highest possible LHC luminosity.

2. For setup B. The maximal voltage drop (5th gap at r=30 cm) amounts to 267 V and R\({}_{max}\)=4. But these numbers should be scaled in proportion with really reachable luminosity at the first stage of LHC operation, and thus could be not so dangerous.

## Addendum. Influence of the size of HV input on the maximal voltage drop

As it is shown above, the maximal voltage drop for setup A amounts to only 14.7 V, if the outer HRL edge is used as HV input (HVI). It leaves room to reduce the size of HVI, because from the practical point of view it is more convenient to apply HV not to the whole outer edge, but to one point. In this case eq. (3) can not be solved analytically and numerical methods were used to estimate the corresponding voltage drop. The result of such calculations depends not only on \(r_{1}\) and \(r_{2}\), but on the angular size of HRL too. It is proposed that end-cap hadron calorimeter will consist of 32 ring segments, thus the angular size of HRL is equal to \(\alpha=2\pi/32\simeq 0.2\) rad and the length of the outer HRL edge is equal to 35.3 cm. The HVI is placed at the center of the outer edge and its size is taken to be 0.5 cm.

The obtained profile of the voltage drop along the outer edge (\(r=r_{2}\)) is shown in Fig.4a and the one along the radial line, coming through the center of HVI, is shown in Fig.4b. For comparison the numerical solution of eq. (3) is shown in Fig.4b for the HVI size of 35.3 cm, i.e. full outer edge length. The difference between the two curves in Fig.4b is surprisingly small. The maximal values of voltage drop are reached at \(r=r_{1}\) and they are equal to 14.8 and 17.5 V, correspondingly. If the HVI size is reduced up to 1 mm, then the maximal voltage drop slightly increases: up to 18.3 V.

The result can be understood using the expression for the resistance of HRL ring segment

\[R=\frac{\rho}{\alpha}\ln\frac{r_{2}}{r_{1}}, \tag{14}\]

which can be derived from eq. (4). It can be seen that the resistance is defined mainly by the angular size \(\alpha\) of the ring segment and has a weak logarithmic dependence on radial sizes. The effective angular size of the region in the vicinity of HVI is about \(\pi\) (compare to 0.2) and it has relatively small resistance, notwithstanding its small linear size (analog of \(r_{1}\)).

Thus even such a small size of HVI as 1 mm leads to the negligible increase of the maximal voltage drop (3.5 V).
