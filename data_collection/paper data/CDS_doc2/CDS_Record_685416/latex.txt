###### Abstract

The High Voltage discharge incidents during the test of the LAr barrel modules at Saclay damaged several of the calibration resistive networks on the Mother Boards. This effect was reproducible in a controlled test-bench environment. Bench tests have demonstrated that an energy discharge of 120 \(\upmu\)J is sufficient to change the resistance beyond its tight tolerance of 0.1%. This corresponds to a discharge at a HV of 500 Volts, assuming a detector capacitance of 1nF. A diode protection circuit at the MB input has been devised to minimize accidental damage to the calibration resistive networks. This protection network is now being used for both the barrel and endcap EM calorimeters. The design and performance of the protection network under various conditions have been studied and summarized in this note.

## 1 Principle

The typical turn-on voltage for a diode is a few volts and provides a low impedance path for the discharge current. The electrical circuit is shown in Figure 1.

**C\({}_{\rm D}\)** : Detector Capacitance \(\sim\) 1 nF for the middle and back section of the EM calorimeter.

**R\({}_{\rm C}\)** : Injection Resistive Network for the Calibration. The back section of the EM uses 1k\(\Omega\) resistors everywhere while the middle section uses 1k\(\Omega\) (500 \(\Omega\)) in \(|\eta|\)\(<\)0.8 (\(|\eta|\)\(>\)0.8).

**D** : The additional connection is a diode (D) protection network.

**PA:** **Preamplifier. The readout cables, MB and SB are not shown explicitly in this figure.

We have tested two types of diodes, the BAV70 from Phillips Semiconductors and a TVS from Protek Devices. The BAV70 is also used as a protection diode at the input of the preamplifiers. The BAV70 consists of two high-speed switching diodes with common cathodes, fabricated in planar technology and encapsulated in the small plastic SMD SOT23 package. Hence, each package can accommodate two signal channels. It has a repetitive peak forward current of 450 mA. We tested the BAV70 with a 10-ohm resistor in series to minimize the damage to the diode itself in the event of a discharge.

Figure 1: Schematic of the diode protection network (not to scale)The PSOT LC devices from Protek Devices1 are constructed using a single TVS diode in series with a compensating (Zener) diode for low capacitance unidirectional protection against electrostatic discharges. We have chosen the PSOT03LC whose small capacitance (\(<5\) pF) relative to detector capacitance (\(\sim 1\) nF) has minimal impact on the physics signals. The results in this note will demonstrate its tolerance for use in our environment.

## 2 Effect on Physics Signal

The effective capacitance that the additional protection network adds is \(\sim 5\) pF which is small compared to the detector capacitance (\(\sim 1\) nF). The effect of the diode protection network on the physics signal is therefore expected to be negligible. This was confirmed using the test setup at BNL. A protection network using the BAV70 diode in series with a \(10\Omega\) resistor was connected at the signal input to the Mother Board. The test was conducted with an input injection current of \(330\)\(\upmu\)A (mid-gain) and \(1.5\) mA (low-gain) at the SB input to simulate a physics signal. Figure 2 shows the observed signal waveforms with and without the protection network superimposed (not discernable). The residuals are also shown in the figure magnified by a factor of a \(1000\). The observed maximum difference (\(5\) x \(10^{-4}\) for I = \(330\)\(\upmu\)A and \(1.25\) x \(10^{-3}\) for I = \(1.5\) mA) is small compared to the signal and is consistent with the results of a spice simulation. The difference at the peak of the signal is much smaller.

Figure 2: Effect of the diode protection network on the signal waveform

Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the effect on the signal using the TVS diode. The residuals shown are the difference in the measured signal with and without the protection network as a function of time normalized to the observed amplitude without the diode. Each protection network has six diodes and therefore serves six input readout channels. In this test, the waveform is measured in all six channels. Furthermore two channels (Diode 3 and Diode 4) have been intentionally damaged by electrostatic discharges to study the effect of a damaged diode on the physics signal. As we will observe later in the note, the capacitance of a damaged diode is seen to be higher thus having some effect on the signal. The test was done for two gain settings, a low-gain (Figure 3) that utilized an input current of 21 \(\mu\)A (\(\sim\) 7 GeV) and a high-gain (Figure 4) that employed an injection current of 1.25 mA (equivalent to \(\sim\) 400 GeV). The low-gain test is dominated by noise and subtle effects are much more visible in the high-gain mode. The observed peak deviation is about 0.1% increasing to about 0.5% when the diode gets damaged. The observations are smaller at the peak of the signal and the minimal effects can probably be calibrated out.

Figure 3: Residuals with the TVS diode in low-gain mode (current Injected is 21 \(\mu\)A)

## 3 Effect on Noise

We estimate no increase in the noise because the added effective capacitance is very small (5 pF) compared to the detector capacitance (\(\sim\) 1 nF). This was confirmed with the test setup at BNL, where the difference in the noise with and without the protection network was below the sensitivity of the test system (\(\sim\) 1%).

## 4 Effect on Calibration

Below the turn-on voltage (\(\sim\) 0.8 volt for BAV70 and \(\sim\)6 V for TVS), the diode acts as a high impedance device (measured to be several M\(\Omega\)) and therefore does not have any significant effect on the calibration resistive network. This has been verified using the test setup at BNL using the BAV70 diode in the protection network. Figure 5 shows the residuals (Difference in waveform with and without the protection network) for 4 DAC settings. The peak residual is observed to be about 0.1% and much smaller at the peak of the signal.

Figure 4: Residuals with TVS in a high-gain mode (injection current = 1.25 mA)

## 5 Implementation of the protection network

The existing connection between the Mother Board and the Summing Board is accomplished using long pins. The assembly process proceeds approximately as follows: The SB's are first connected to the Kapton Electrodes. The SB sums signal over four signal electrodes in the middle and back layers and bring the output to an open-ended receptacle on the board. Each SB serves 16 electrodes. The total number of signal output per summing board is 16 middle channels and 8 back channels. After all the SB's are installed, a thin sheet of G10 (0.015" thick) is placed over them. The G10 provides an electrical separation between the MB and SB and have holes drilled in appropriate places where the long pins from the MB penetrate to make connection to the receptacles on the SB. The MB's are then installed. Long Pins are inserted through the MB into the SB to make the connection. Finally, the cold cables are attached - the low profile connectors on the cables are connected to the MB. This assembly process is illustrated in the Figure 6.

Each MB in the back region serves four summing boards. There are 13 long pins that are held by a rigid carrier and which can be inserted simultaneously to make the connection between the MB and SB. Eight of these combs (the 13 pins on a carrier look like a comb) are needed to connect each SB to a MB. Note that there is a redundant connection provided for each signal channel and every alternating pin on the comb (and hence the MB & SB) is a ground pin. An artists sketch of the interconnections is shown in Figure 7.

Figure 5: Effect of protection network (BAV70) on calibration signal for 4 DAC settings.

Figure 6: A sketch of the various interconnections between the MB and electrodes

Figure 7: Sketch of the interconnections between the SB, MB and electrodes (not to scale)

The diode protection network was assembled on a modified version of this comb. A special thin printed circuit board (a 2-layer board, 0.062" thick and consistent with the thickness of the rigid carrier supporting the long pins) was designed with surface mount diodes and resistors. Long Pins can then be soldered on this board to provide connection between the MB and SB. Since every alternating pin is a ground pin, the connection of the diode cathode to the ground required no long trace routing. Furthermore, each diode package carries two diodes with a common cathode serving two signal channels. As mentioned earlier, there is a redundant connection between the MB and SB for every channel, i.e. there are two combs that provide connection to the same channels. _The protection network is assembled only on the redundant comb._

A top view of the printed circuit board with the placement of the various components is shown in Figure 8. The rows of holes, labeled "S1", are plated through holes where the long comb-pins will be soldered. Each of these pins is alternating ground and signal connections. The diodes D1, D2 and D3 have the common cathode connected to ground while the resistors R1 through R6 serve the six signal channels on this comb. While we are investigating the production of these boards with an external company, we developed a few prototype boards at BNL for conducting the tests. The results reported are based on these prototype boards. The resistance in series with the diode used in the prototype boards was \(10\Omega\).

Test Bench Setup

A schematic of the test setup is shown in Figure 9. A HV discharge was injected at the input to the summing board. A capacitance of 1 nF was used to mimic the detector. A back MB corresponding to sector 1 (\(0.0<|\eta|<0.2\)) was used in the test. This MB uses 1k\(\Omega\) resistors on all networks. The SB to MB connection is made using the prototype comb with the protection network discussed earlier.

The top half of the MB was cabled (cold cable + pig-tail). All the signal channels were terminated with 25\(\Omega\). The calibration input socket on the MB was terminated with 50\(\Omega\). The calibration resistors were measured both at room and in LN2 before injecting any HV discharges. The test fixture was then placed in LN2. HV discharges are introduced sequentially one at a time on the same channel.

The HV was ramped to 2kV. With a 1nF capacitor, the energy of each discharge is 2 mJ. The discharges were introduced in Channel 27 on the top half of the MB. The region protected by the diodes is shown in Figure 10, and the corresponding calibration resistors were monitored during the test. The calibration resistors were measured in LN2 after injecting a total number of 10, 60 and 160 discharges using a simple 2-point measurement technique. After the 160 discharges, the MB was removed from LN2, warmed up, and the resistors measured at room temperature. The forward and reverse characteristics of the diode where HV discharges were introduced were measured.

Test for failure modes of the diode

We subjected the diode to very high-energy electrostatic discharges that are not expected in a normal operating environment. The purpose of the test was to characterize the possible failure mode of the diode. Additional new combs with the protection networks were used for this test. The test proceeded identically in all aspects as during the test under normal operating conditions. The first phase of the test introduced 10 discharges at 2kV (2 mJ per discharge). The calibration resistive networks were then measured. All resistors were within specification as expected. The HV was then ramped to 5kV and 10 additional discharges were injected. The increased HV corresponds to a factor of 6.25 increase in energy per discharge (12.5 mJ). The calibration resistors were once again measured and the results are tabulated below. The table above shows that under these extreme conditions, the calibration resistors suffer some damage. The largest damage is in the resistor corresponding to the channel where discharges were injected. This resistor measured 734\(\Omega\) instead of 1000\(\Omega\) after the discharges at 5 kV.

The forward characteristics of the diode are plotted in Figure 9. Note that the forward characteristics before and after discharges are plotted on different horizontal scales. They show that the turn on point of the diode before any discharges are injected is at 0.7 V. After 10 discharges are injected at 2kV and then at 5kV, the diode turns on around 3.5 V. Thus the diode looses its effectiveness in providing adequate protection under such extreme conditions. However, note that the late turn-on of the diode implies that below 3.5V, the diode behaves as a high impedance (open) device. This implies that, in the remote scenario that the BAV70 diode does suffer damage due to discharge effects, the physics signal will not be affected. As seen in the table above, such a failure will reduce the protection to the calibration resistive network exposing them to damage from discharges. The loss in protection will depend on how the extent of the damage to the diode.

## 10 Measurement of diode characteristics after irradiation

During the R&D studies of the preamplifiers for the EM barrel calorimeter, the BAV70 diodes, while mounted on the preamplifiers, were irradiated with gamma's with doses exceeding 200 kRad. Some minor effects were noticeable at the time, but are not attributable to the protection diode. The TVS diodes have been irradiated with doses exceeding 0.5 Mrad and no change in its characteristics have been observed after irradiation. The protection networks were also radiated with a total dose of approximately 5 x 10\({}^{14}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\) at CERI (Orleans/France) (1 MeV equivalent neutrons) and no change was observed in the characteristics of the preamplifier. These measurements are discussed in detail below.

A diode leak in a high radiation environment should not have any effect on the signal, as it is AC coupled at the preamplifier. The effect on the calibration has yet to be determined, as there may be a small DC leakage current flowing through the calibration resistive network.

The irradiation with neutrons was made at CERI (Orleans/France), between 24 and 26 Oct 2001 in 3 runs of about 6 hours each, separated by about 18 hours. Samples were immersed in liquid argon during the whole period. The total current delivered by the accelerator was monitored, amounting to a total of 1.75 Cb on target. From the calibrated fluence to current ratio this corresponds to a total dose between 3 to 6 \(\times 10^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\). From Ni probes put close to the electronics components, analyzed meanwhile, the fluence ranged, depending on the exact places from 4.9 to 7.1 10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\)

Taking two points (8mA and 40 mA) from the V/I diode characteristics drawn with an automatic parameter analyser (HP 4145B), the following results are obtained:

On the BAV one observes a slight shift of the corner point, while the slope remains more or less constant. For the TVS, the corner point is more stable, but the slope flattens somewhat. This is illustrated in the figures below.

As a further information, the behaviour of two BAV diodes was followed with a simple multimeter during the full operation and showed the following behaviour:

warm, at startup Vth=0.65 volts

cold, before irradiation Vth=1.05 volt

cold right after first irradiation of \(\sim\)6 hours Vth=1.15 volt

with some recovery (0.02 volt or so) until next irradiation

with a new step of + 0.1 volt typically

after 12 days of recovery, in the warm Vth=0.71 Volts

## 11 Modification of TVS characteristics at cold and under sparking

A small setup was used to bench test BAV and TVS components under sparking. It is based on a piece of an electrode, supplemented by a needle, adjustable in height and connected to ground to trigger spark trains. With a simple circuitry, sparks in a train were counted up to the desired number, when the needle was then manually recessed. The component to be tested was connected between the signal output and ground, with long enough leads (30 cm) to allow immersing it in an open LN2 bath. The same LN2 bath and leads were used to measure the component characteristics with the automatic recorder. Results shown concern the TVS devices, more attractive for our purpose.

### Behaviour in the cold

The characteristics become sharper, indicating a better protection in the cold. After 10 k sparks, in the cold, the characteristic is unchanged.

Figure 18: **Protek TVS characteristics in the cold, before an after ten thousand sparks**

### Behaviour at ambient temperature

Another test consisted in measuring the characteristics after a number of sparks (2000 for data shown in the figure below) at room temperature. In this case one observes two phenomena (Figure 19):

On the Zener side, the characteristics become smoother, indicating a somewhat degraded protection. On the reverse diode side, a conduction branch appears; indicating that the diode associated to the Zener in the TVS might be shorted.

This is confirmed by the fact that the capacitance goes from a few pF for a new device to 30 pF or so after this cycle. The existence of this short is in principle not a problem, at least if one leaves aside the small noise increase brought in by the increased capacity.

From the above it is quite clear that one should avoid sparking at room temperature even when the protective combs are in place.

## 12 Added protection to prevent failures

The redundancy between the SB and the MB helps against any accidental damages. The protection network is only mounted on the redundant comb, the other comb of long-pins remain the same. Furthermore, the length of the long pin has been increased from the present 0.041" to a maximum length of 0.046" to provide additional connection reliability. If there is an open in the protection network, either due to discharges or due to mechanical failures, the physics signal will not be affected with either the TVS or the BAV70 diode.

Figure 19: Behaviour of a Protek TVS at room temperature: (1) before (2) after sparking.

## 12 Installation of protective combs

For modules that have yet to be assembled, the introduction of the combs with protective networks requires no additional resources and does not change the installation process. For modules that have already been assembled, the long pins must be removed and replaced. This also requires removal of some of the low-profile connectors from the MB to gain access to the long pins. However, neither the cable routing nor the already installed MB/SB need to be disturbed.

As already mentioned, only the back motherboards will use the protective networks. The back MB has redundancy in the connection between the motherboard and summing board. Each row of connection, as shown in Figure 10, provides 6 signal connections. These rows are redundant, i.e. there are two rows of connections for the 6 signal connections. The protection network will be mounted on only one of the two rows, the other row retaining the old pin connections. The exception is the outer rows of connections on each motherboard, where protective networks will be mounted on both the redundant rows. This is to provide additional robustness in the connection to the outer rows, which benefit from the larger pin length (0.046") on the protective networks.

## 13 Production and test of protection networks

Each protection network comb accommodates six channels as shown in Figure 8. Each back motherboard require 16 such protection networks + 4 for outer row redundancy as described in the previous section. Each module consists of 14 back MB and hence require 280 protection network boards. A total of 8960 protection networks are required for the barrel calorimeter.

Brookhaven National Laboratory is producing the protection networks for the barrel calorimeter. CPPM Marsielle is handling the production for the Endcap calorimeter. Each protection network board undergoes several tests before being shipped for installation. These include:

After assembly of the combs:

* Visual Inspection after assembly at the factory
* The protection networks are cold cycled in LN2 5 times
* They are then subject to electrical tests to ensure that the diode characteristics are within specification. Proper electrical connectivity is automatically ensured by the following tests.
* Forward Turn-On: \(\circ\) At V = 3.5 volts, require I \(<\) 100 nA \(\circ\) At V = 6.5 volts, require I \(>\) 10 mA (past turn-on)
* Reverse Leakage: \(\circ\) At V = -10 volts, require I \(<\) 100 nA

The testing is carried out at the factory after the assembly of the protection networks. A special test fixture has been where protection network combs can be inserted andautomatically tested to yield a pass or a fail result. Networks that fail the test are discarded.

## 14 Conclusion

Both the BAV70 and the TVS diodes have been demonstrated on the bench to minimize damage to the calibration resistors from HV discharge effects. This device can be accommodated in a special comb that provides the connection between the MB and the SB. The addition of the protective comb does not cause any significant change to either the physics signal or the calibration waveform and does not introduce any measurable noise in the system. These diodes have been demonstrated to withstand high radiation doses expected in the EM calorimeters.

We have chosen the TVS diode for our application as it offers superior protection against large number of discharges. The production of these protection networks began in December of 2001 and the first batch of these networks was delivered early in March 2002.
