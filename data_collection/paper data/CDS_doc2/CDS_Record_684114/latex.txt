## 0 Introduction

The aim of this note is to study the longitudinal and lateral development of high energy gamma showers produced in air. The simulation is performed in the new Geant4 framework (version 4.1.1).

High energy (HE) and very high energy (VHE) gamma rays come from a variety of astronomical sources which produce charged cosmic rays (supernovae, neutron stars, quasars and the cores of active galaxies). They are not deviated by galactic or extragalactic magnetic fields so that their directions bring the information of the production site. The EGRET experiment [6-1] and by ground based telescopes imaging the Cerenkov light of air showers induced by gamma rays in the \(0.4+10\,\mathrm{TeV}\) energy range [6-2] have recently proved that a consistent number of sources of HE/VHE gamma rays do exist.

Gammas up to 100 TeV traversing the Earth atmosphere generate electromagnetic showers.

### 0 Simulated Detector

In our simplified model the atmosphere is assumed to be 28 radiation lengths (r.l.) deep at fixed density (1.290 mg/cm\({}^{3}\)). Electromagnetic cascades from 1 GeV to 10 TeV are simulated and tracked in a big air box.

To guarantee a complete shower containment, the simulated detector is a box, about 9 km (corresponding to 28 r.l.) deep on a surface of 15 r.l. X 15 r.l. Along the longest edge a sandwich of 28 air layers is set to study the shower shape.

Each sandwich (one r. l. deep) is composed of a thin layer (-0.1 mm) for particle counting and a thick layer (-one r. l.) in which the energy loss is recorded.

A grid of small sensitive detectors (4 m\({}^{2}\) each, placed 20 m apart, see Figure 3-1) lies at the box end. The electromagnetic shower starts at the top of the air box (see Figure 3-1). This grid is supposed to cover a large area (\(-9\)km\({}^{2}\)) on the Earth surface in an hypotetical experiment aiming at recording residual high energy gamma showers.

Figure 2-1 shows a 3D view of the simulated detector. Segmentations along the longest edge are shown.

The shower development is studied along the whole path, the simulated detector grid at the end mimics the detector in a true experiment.

## 0.3 Shower Simulation

Electromagnetic showers from gamma interactions have been generated from the upper surface of the air box at different energies. Shower particles are counted every radiation length, when they pass across the thin layers. Energy loss is recorded by the thick layers all along the shower path.

In Figure 3-1 a 10 GeV gamma event in the detector is shown. At this energy the shower is well contained in the volume and all the shower particles stop well before reaching the detector grid (not on scale in Figure 3-1). Residual particles on the grid detector surface are expected at higher energies.

All physics processes, such as bremsstrahlung, ionization, multiple scattering, pair production, are simulated in the tracking.

### 0.3 Simulated Statistics

Different runs were performed at fixed energy. Since the number of particles crossing the thin planes is sensitive to the cutoff energy, different cuts in range for particle tracking were tested. In Table 0.3 all the cuts applied in the present simulation are listed and the correspondent

cut values in energy are shown both for electrons (or positrons) and photons.

The last column refers to the approximate time per event per GeV in SPECint95 units.

Figure 3-2 (a,b) shows the longitudinal developments for a 100 GeV gamma shower with different cuts. The curves are similar for any of the cut applied except for the shorter (1 cm) which it was found _not to be physical_ in Geant4. The parameterization of the total cross section of bremsstrahlung, in fact, requires in Geant4 a default minimum cut of 10 KeV, while 1 cm cut on e+/e- corresponds to \(\sim\)8KeV. The same behavior is present in the energy deposition curves at 1 TeV (c).

Taking into account the characteristics of detectors used in this kind of experiments, our simulation was performed using the following cuts:

_- 200 KeV threshold on e+/e-_, which corresponds to a 38 cm cut in range;

_- 50 KeV threshold on gammas_, up to 1 TeV energy of the incoming gamma;

_- 200 KeV threshold on gammas_, for the 10 TeV sample.

The statistics produced with these cuts is summarized in Table 3-2. The following analysis refers to them.

### Longitudinal and Lateral Shower Development

The longitudinal development is governed by the high-energy part of the cascade, and scales as the radiation length. The histograms in Figure 3-3 and Figure 3-4 show the signal (electrons and protons) as a function of the distance from the gamma vertex (expressed in radiation length) for different energies of the primary gamma. The shower maximum position scales with energy. At each incident energy the total number of electrons along the shower exceeds the correspondent number of positrons, according to the different electromagnetic processes involving particles and antiparticles.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline
**Cut in range** & **Cut on e+/e- energy** & **Cut on \(\gamma\) energy** & **Time / (event X GeV)** \\ \hline
1 cm & 8.07 KeV & 990 eV & 66.9 SPECint95 \\
38 cm & 202 KeV & 2.14 KeV & 7.5 a - 7.1 b  SPECint95 \\
1 m & 378 KeV & 3.15 KeV & 7.7 SPECint95 \\
10 m & 2.4 MeV & 8.08 KeV & 3.9 SPECint95 \\
172 m & 48.8 MeV & 50.3 KeV & 0.75 SPECint95 \\
312 m & 95.2 MeV & 203 KeV & 0.71 SPECint95 \\ \hline \end{tabular} a. This time is computed when the 38 cm cut is applied to e-/e+ while the 172 m cut is set to gammas.

b. This second time refers instead to the same cut on e-/e+ but to a 312 m cut on gammas.

Simulations of the lateral distribution of electromagnetic cascades are shown in Figure 3-5 and 3-6, where the average lateral dimension of the shower at 90% of e+/e- containment has been plotted for different energies. The higher the energy, the narrower the shower.

This transverse size is comparable to the _Moliere Radius_\(R_{M}\). given by

\(R_{M}=X_{0}\cdot E_{s}/E_{c}\)\(\sim\) 137 m

where \(E_{s}\) is the _scale energy_\(=\)\(\mathcal{J(4\pi)\ \sim}\alpha\cdot m_{e}\cdot c^{2}\) - 21 MeV and \(E_{c}=(800\mathrm{MeV})\ /(Z+1.2)\) is the _critical energy_. As it is well known, on average, only 10% of the energy lies outside a cylinder with radius \(R_{M}\). About 99% of the shower is contained within 3.5 \(R_{M}\).

### Energy Deposition and Shower Particle Composition

The energy deposited by the electromagnetic showers along the path (collected by the thick layers) has been plotted for different cuts as a function of the distance from the shower origin (see Figure 3-2 (c)). Figure 3-7 shows fractional energy deposition per radiation length for the five different energies with the final cuts mentioned in section 3-1. One can observe that the electron number in the longitudinal development shown in Figure 3-3 falls off more quickly than the energy deposition. This is because, with increasing depth, a larger fraction of the shower energy is carried by photons.

### 4.0 Conclusions

We simulated high energy electromagnetic showers with different cuts in range and at different energies. Once understood the _best_ cuts in range to apply to particles in the tracking procedure, several runs were performed to reach a good statistics. The lateral and the longitudinal development of the shower as well as the energy deposition along the cascade path were studied.

The shower is almost always contained in the air volume. At 10 TeV anyway some particles reach the final detectors and lose energy as shown in Table 4.1.
