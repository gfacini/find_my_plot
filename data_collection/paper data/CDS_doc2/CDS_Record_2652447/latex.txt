## 1 Introduction

The study of the scattering of two massive vector bosons \(V=W\), \(Z\) (vector boson scattering, VBS) provides a key opportunity to probe the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) mechanism as well as physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) [1; 2]. It is still unknown whether the discovered Higgs boson [3; 4] preserves unitarity of the longitudinal \(VV\) scattering amplitude at all energies, or if other new physics processes are involved [5; 6; 7; 8; 9]. In the VBS topology, two incoming quarks radiate bosons which interact, yielding a final state of two jets from the outgoing quarks, and two massive bosons which decay into fermions. This final state can be the result of \(VVjj\) electroweak (EW) production with and without a scattering topology, or of processes involving the strong interaction, shown in the Feynman diagrams in Figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

With the largest cross-section ratio of electroweak to strong production [10; 11], events with \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}\) plus

The lines are labeled by quarks (\(q\)), vector bosons (\(V\)), and fermions (\(f\)). Particles with different indices may or may not have the same flavour.

two jets (\(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\)) provide one of the best opportunities to study the scattering of two vector bosons. The \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) VBS processes (Figure 1) include the contributions from triple gauge vertices in the \(t\)-channel, quartic gauge vertices, and the \(t\)-channel Higgs-mediated diagram. The non-VBS EW processes with the same final state (Figure 2) also contribute to the signal, but the signal region contributions can be suppressed through kinematic selections used in the analysis. Interactions involving at least two strong couplings (\(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) QCD) are considered as background (Figure 3). We do not consider interference between the EW and QCD processes in this note. ATLAS and CMS have both observed the EW process at 13 TeV with significances 6.9 \(\sigma\) and 5.5 \(\sigma\), respectively [12; 13]. The focus for the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) physics program will be the measurement of the scattering cross section of two longitudinally polarised \(W\) bosons.

The ATLAS detector [14; 15] is a multi-purpose particle detector with a cylindrical geometry.1 It consists of layers of inner tracking detectors surrounded by a superconducting solenoid, calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer, and will need several upgrades to cope with the expected higher luminosity at the HL-LHC and its associated high pileup and intense radiation environment. The primary motivation for the upgrade design studies is to maximise the potential of the experiment for searches and measurements despite these harsh conditions. A new inner tracking system, extending the tracking region from \(|\eta|\leq 2.7\) up to \(|\eta|\leq 4.0\), will provide the ability to reconstruct forward charged particle tracks, which can be matched to calorimeter clusters for forward electron reconstruction, or associated to forward jets. The inner tracker extension also enables muon identification at high pseudorapidities if additional detectors (such as micro-pattern gaseous or silicon pixel detectors) are installed between the endcap calorimeters and the New Small Wheel [16] in the region \(2.7<|\eta|\leq 4.0\). Despite being in an area without magnetic field, such detectors would increase the muon spectrometer acceptance and could be used to identify inner detector tracks in the forward region as muons, while relying entirely on the inner tracker for the momentum measurement. The impact of the addition of the High Granularity Timing Detector (HGTD) [17] is not considered.

Footnote 1: The ATLAS experiment uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal \(pp\) interaction point at the centre of the detector. The positive \(x\)-axis is defined by the direction from the interaction point towards the centre of the LHC ring, with the positive \(y\)-axis pointing upwards, while the beam direction is along the \(z\)-axis. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r\), \(\phi\) ) are used in the transverse (\(x\), \(y\)) plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam direction. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) from the \(z\)-axis as \(\eta=-\ln[\tan(\theta/2)]\). The distance in \(\eta\)–\(\phi\) space between two objects is defined as \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\). Transverse energy is computed as \(E_{\rm T}=E\cdot\sin\theta\).

In this note we study the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) EW production in the context of these planned upgrades, presenting the prospects for the measurement of the inclusive EW, and purely longitudinal scattering cross sections. With a more realistic background and systematics estimation, this result supersedes the prediction of the inclusive \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) EW significance and measurement precision presented in [18].

## 2 Monte Carlo Samples

Various processes aside from QCD and EW \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) contribute to producing an experimental signature of two prompt leptons with the same electric charge, two jets, and missing transverse momentum in the final state. The dominant prompt background process is \(WZ\)+jets production where both bosons decay leptonically and one lepton fails identification or falls outside of the detector acceptance. Other processes with two prompt leptons with the same electric charge in the final state include the \(t\bar{t}V\) process, \(ZZ\)+jets production, and multiple parton interactions. These other processes contribute only a few percent to the total background. The non-prompt-lepton background arises from processes with one or two jets misreconstructed as leptons, or leptons from hadron decays (including \(b\)- and \(c\)-hadron decays), such as \(W\)+jets and top quark production. Finally, processes such as \(t\bar{t}\) and Drell-Yan production contribute with two prompt leptons of opposite electric charge where one lepton's charge is misidentified. We do not consider background contributions from \(W\gamma\) and \(Z\gamma\) processes in this note.

Monte Carlo (MC) generators are used to model signal and background processes at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV, with the number of events scaled to an integrated luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}\)=3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) as expected for the full HL-LHC physics program. The signal (VBS and non-VBS EW) and background (QCD) production of \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) events are simulated using Madgraph5_aMC@NLO[19] with the NNPDF3.0 PDF set [20], interfaced with PYTHIA v8[21] for parton showering, hadronisation and underlying event modelling. An additional Madgraph5_aMC@NLO sample with polarisation information is produced, to separate the longitudinal contribution (LL) to the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) process from the transverse and mixed contributions (LT+TT). In this sample the \(W\) bosons are decayed, assuming they are on-shell and have no spin correlations, using the DECAY routine provided with MadGraph.

The \(WZ\) process is simulated using SHERPA v2.2.0[22, 23, 24, 25] with next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}\) for up to one associated parton, and leading order (LO) accuracy for two and three associated partons in the final state. Both QCD and EW production of \(WZ\) processes are included in the \(WZ\) background estimation. The generation of \(ZZ\) events is done using SHERPA v2.2.2 with up to two additional partons in the final state. For the generation of triboson events, matrix elements for all combinations of \(pp\to VVV\) (\(V=W,Z\)) have been generated using SHERPA v2.2.2 with up to two additional partons in the final state. Both fully leptonic decays, and processes in which one of the bosons decays hadronically, are considered. The generation of \(W\)+jets events is done for electron, muon, and tau final states using Madgraph5_aMC@NLO at LO and the NNPDF3.0 PDF set, plus PYTHIA v8 for fragmentation. They are simulated for up to one additional parton at NLO and up to two additional partons at LO. The generation of \(Z\)+jets events is done using the POWHEG-BOX event generator with the CT10 PDF set [26], plus PYTHIA v8 for parton showering and fragmentation. For the generation of top-quark pairs, the POWHEG-BOX v1 event generator with the CT10 PDF set in the matrix element calculations is used. Electroweak \(Wt\)-channel single-top quark events are generated using the POWHEG-BOX v1 event generator. This event generator uses the four-flavour scheme for the NLO matrix-element calculations together with the fixed four-flavour PDF set CT10f4. For all top-quark processes, top-quark spin correlations are preserved (for t-channel, top-quarks are decayed using MadSpin). The parton shower, fragmentation, and underlying event are simulated using PYTHIA v6 with the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and the corresponding Perugia 2012 tune [27]. The top-quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV. The EvtGen v1.2.0 program [28] is used to decay bottom and charm hadrons for the POWHEG-BOX samples.

Additional pileup interactions are generated with PYTHIA v8 with the AU2 set of tuned parameters [29] and an average of 200 interactions per bunch crossing, and added event-by-event to the simulated samples.

## 3 Object and Event Selection

The analysis begins with particle-level objects, the detector simulation of which is estimated using smearing functions [30] derived from a full simulation of the ATLAS detector based on GEANT4 [31; 32], with the exception of pileup events which are fully simulated.

Lepton trigger and identification efficiencies are derived as a function of the lepton \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and used to estimate the likelihood of a given lepton passing either the trigger or identification requirement, respectively.2 Muon transverse momentum and electron energy resolutions are also parameterised as a function of \(\eta\) and either the transverse momentum (for muons) or transverse energy (for electrons). A tight isolation requirement is applied on the leptons. An estimation of the track- and calorimeter-based isolation is made, summing the momentum and energy, respectively, of stable generator-level particles with momenta greater than 1 GeV in a cone around each lepton. Only charged particles are taken into account for the track-based isolation, while the calorimeter-based isolation considers both charged and neutral particles, with the exception of neutrinos. The isolation criteria applied to each lepton are shown in Table 1, and are important for reducing the large contribution from non-prompt leptons originating from b-decays. An additional function for electrons3 parameterises the likelihood of charge misidentification as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\).

Footnote 2: The muon New Small Wheel Phase 1 upgrade will have extended the muon trigger to \(|\eta|\leq 2.7\).

Footnote 3: The charge misidentification probability for muons is negligible.

The missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) is defined at particle level as the transverse component of the vectorial sum of the final-state neutrino momenta. The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution is parameterised as a function of the overall event activity. Final-state particles with lifetime greater than 30 ps are clustered into jets (denoted as particle-level jets) using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [33] with radius parameter \(R\) = 0.4. Final-state muons and neutrinos are not included in the jet clustering. To avoid double-counting jets associated with electrons, an overlap requirement is applied to exclude jets within a cone of \(\Delta R_{e,j}<0.05\) of any electron with transverse energy \(>7\) GeV. The particle-level jet momentum is smeared as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) to account for detector effects.

The experimental signature of the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) scattering process consists of two leptons (electrons or muons) with the same electric charge, two jets well-separated in rapidity, and moderate \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). Events are preselected by either a single-muon or single-electron trigger requiring transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) and 25 GeV, respectively.

Jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<4.5\) are considered for the analysis, and a selection requirement on all jets with transverse momenta below 100 GeV is applied in order to distinguish between jets resulting from the hard scatter interaction and jets from the accompanying soft interactions (pileup jets). This jet vertex

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c} \hline \hline  & Electron Isolation & Muon Isolation \\ \hline \hline Track-based isolation cone size & \(\Delta R<0.2\) & \(\Delta R<0.3\) \\ Track-based isolation requirement & \(\Sigma p_{T}/p_{T}^{e}<0.06\) & \(\Sigma p_{T}/p_{T}^{\mu}<0.04\) \\ Calorimeter-based isolation cone size & \(\Delta R<0.2\) & \(\Delta R<0.2\) \\ Calorimeter-based isolation requirement & \(\Sigma E_{T}/p_{T}^{e}<0.06\) & \(\Sigma E_{T}/p_{T}^{\mu}<0.15\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Electron and muon isolation requirements.

requirement is based on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction of the jet tracks originating from the hard scattering vertex4. The probability to misidentify a pileup jet as resulting from the hard scattering process is assumed to be 2%, with a resulting signal selection efficiency of 86% for \(|\eta|<1.5\) and 80% for \(|\eta|>2.9\)[34]. Jets either pass or fail this requirement, which is applied for jets with \(|\eta|\leq 3.8\) where track information is available for the entire jet cone. To reduce the significant contamination from pileup jets, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold is increased from 30 to 70 \(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\) for jets outside the region where the vertex requirement is applied. The value of 70 \(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\) was chosen based on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) distributions of the fully-simulated pileup jets in the events, since most pileup jets have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<70\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\) across the entire \(\eta\) range. Jets passing the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold and vertex requirements are preselected.

Footnote 4: The vertex corresponding to the hard scatter interaction, typically the vertex with the highest \(\Sigma p_{T}^{2}\).

Electrons and muons with transverse momenta \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>7\) and 6 \(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\), respectively, and with pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\leq 4.0\) are preselected. An electron fake rate parameterisation allows for a fraction of jets to also be considered as preselected electrons. The fake electron function is based on the expected probability of a jet being misidentified as an electron, parameterised as a function of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\).

After all the object selection criteria have been applied, the two highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets are defined as the leading and sub-leading _tag jets_ in the event, and the two highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) leptons are defined as the leading and subleading _signal leptons_.

The default event selection, as used in [34], is shown in Table 2, requiring two well-separated leptons of the same electric charge, and with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\). A minimum requirement on the dilepton mass reduces the contamination from low-mass Drell-Yan processes. Background contributions from \(Z\) boson decays in the dielectron channel are significant, owing to a high likelihood of charge misidentification for electrons, so events with dilepton mass within 10 of the \(Z\) boson mass are excluded in the dielectron channel. In the dimuon channel we expect this contribution to be negligible. A requirement on \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) further reduces

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c} \hline \hline Selection requirement & Selection value \\ \hline \hline Signal lepton kinematics & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\) and \(|\eta|\leq 4.0\) \\ Tag jet kinematics & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\) and \(|\eta|\leq 4.5\) (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}>70\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\) for \(|\eta|>3.8\)) \\ \hline Dilepton separation and charge & Exactly two signal leptons with \(\Delta R_{\ell,\ell}\geq 0.3\), \(q_{\ell_{1}}\times q_{\ell_{2}}>0\) \\ Dilepton mass & \(m_{\ell\ell}>20\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\) \\ \(Z_{ee}\) veto & \(|m_{ee}-m_{Z}|>10\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\) \\ \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) & \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>40\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\) \\ Jet selection and separation & at least two jets with \(\Delta R_{\ell,j}>0.3\) \\ Number of b-tagged jets & 0 \\ Dijet rapidity separation & \(\Delta\eta_{j,j}>2.5\) \\ Number of additional preselected leptons & 0 \\ Dijet mass & \(m_{jj}>500\)\(\mathrm{\text{Ge}\kern-0.6667pt\text{V}}\) \\ Lepton centrality5  & \(\zeta>0\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

the background from charge misidentified events. The _tag jets_ are required to be well-separated in rapidity and to not overlap with the signal leptons, and events containing any b-tagged jets are vetoed. A veto on additional preselected leptons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>7(6)\) GeV for electrons (muons) significantly reduces background from \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\) events. Finally, the _tag jets_ are required to have a large invariant mass, and a requirement on the lepton centrality \(\zeta\) is imposed to enhance the purity of the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) electroweak signal.

An optimisation of the object and event selection criteria was also performed using the random grid search (RGS) cut-based algorithm [35], to improve the signal selection against the total background, here considering only the longitudinal contribution to the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) scattering as signal. The optimisation was performed over the lepton and jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), dilepton and dijet invariant mass, and centrality requirements, with the additional requirement that there be more than 1000 signal events remaining post-optimisation. The optimised selection criteria are shown in Table 3. The increased lepton and jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirements significantly reduce background contributions, and loosening the centrality requirement increases the number of the typically softer longitudinal \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) events passing the selection. In the next section the event yields and cross section measurement for both the default and optimised sets of event selection criteria are presented. For the extraction of the longitudinal scattering significance, only the optimised set is used.

## 4 Results

The total number of inclusive signal (\(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) EW) and background events expected after the full event selection for an integrated luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}\)=3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Table 4. Events with either a misidentified charge electron, or a jet faking an electron, are summed for all background samples and combined into a

\begin{table}

single entry titled "charge misidentification" or "jets faking leptons", respectively. The remaining \(t\bar{t}\), single top, and \(W\)+jet events that pass the full event selection are listed as "Other non-prompt".

A total of 3490 signal events are expected, with 9888 background events. The relative fraction of signal to background events varies by final state, so the event yields for the separate channels, \(\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}\), \(e^{\pm}e^{\pm}\), \(\mu^{\pm}e^{\pm}\), and \(e^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}\), are also shown. The number of expected signal and background events after the optimised full event selection are shown in Table 5. The dramatic reduction in the background yields is primarily a result of increasing the leading and subleading jet \(p_{\rm T}\) requirements, which rejects most of the background from fake and misidentified charge contributions from \(W\), \(Z\)+jet events.

The dijet invariant mass distributions for all events are shown in Figure 4 for the default and optimised event selections. Additionally for the optimised selection, the dilepton invariant mass and the integrated

number of signal and background events as a function of the dilepton invariant mass is shown in Figure 5. Categorisation by lepton flavour and charge increases the overall analysis sensitivity, so the \(m_{jj}\) distribution is obtained for each of the eight channels6 and combined in a profile likelihood fit to extract the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) electroweak production cross section, using the same method as the ATLAS analysis that presents the observation of \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) (EW) using 13 TeV \(pp\) collision data [12].

The uncertainties considered are given in Table 6. Experimental systematics on the trigger, leptons, jets, and flavour tagging are taken from the 13 TeV analysis unchanged, while for the baseline estimation, rate uncertainties on the backgrounds are halved. An "optimistic" set of uncertainties is also presented, where the uncertainties on the non-data-driven backgrounds are aggressively reduced.

With the default event selection and baseline set of uncertainties, the expected \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) cross section obtained from the fit is \(16.89\ \pm\ 0.36\ (\text{stat})\ \pm\ 0.53\ (\text{theory})\ \pm\ 0.86\ (\text{sys})\) fb. With the optimised event selection the systematic uncertainty is reduced by 5%, with an expected cross section of \(16.94\ \pm\ 0.36\ (\text{stat})\ \pm\ 0.53\ (\text{theory})\ \pm\ 0.78\ (\text{sys})\) fb. Figure 6 shows the projection of the expected total uncertainty on the cross section, as well as the individual components, as a function of integrated luminosity, for the optimised event selection. Additionally, Figure 6 shows the projections with the "optimistic" set of uncertainties, which results in a small effect overall.

In the SM, the Higgs boson unitarises the longitudinal \(VV\) scattering amplitude completely. If, however, the SM is an effective theory of a more general one with an additional strongly-coupled sector, the unitarisation may be only partial, and new physics processes may be involved. In the context of \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) scattering, two quantities that are particular sensitive to the longitudinal scattering component are the dijet azimuthal separation \(\Delta\phi(j,j)\) and leading lepton \(p_{\text{T}}\), with the longitudinal scattering preferentially occurring in the regions of large dijet separation and low leading lepton \(p_{\text{T}}\)[36; 37]. The shape comparisons of these

An additional requirement restricting the pseudorapidity of the subleading lepton to the central region of the detector (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) is made, which

An additional requirement on the subleading lepton pseudorapidity (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) is made to reduce the contributions from the fake and charge-misidentified backgrounds.

The dashed lines show the expected significance for the optimistic scenario (see Table 6).

significantly reduces the contributions from the fake and charge-misidentified backgrounds. A simultaneous binned likelihood fit of the \(\Delta\phi(j,j)\) distributions in the two regions of \(m_{jj}\) is performed in four lepton flavour channels (\(e^{\pm}e^{\pm}\), \(e^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}\), \(\mu^{\pm}e^{\pm}\), \(\mu^{\pm}\mu^{\pm}\)) to extract the longitudinal scattering significance, considering the LT+TT contributions as background. Due to the limited statistics, categorisation by lepton charge or leading lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is not done in this case. The expected significance of the observation of the \(W_{L}^{\pm}W_{L}^{\pm}jj\) process obtained from the fit is \(1.8\sigma\), with an expected precision of 47% on the measurement. Figure 9 shows the expected significance as a function of integrated luminosity.

Measuring VBS processes at a hadron collider is experimentally challenging due to small cross sections and the difficulty of separating longitudinal states from transverse ones. Recent studies [38] have shown that advances in machine learning can improve the prospects for the measurement of the \(W_{L}^{\pm}W_{L}^{\pm}jj\) process. In addition, improvements in the lepton selection efficiency will also help to improve the measurement by increasing the statistics in the signal region.

## 5 Conclusion

The \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) channel is one of the best channels with which to measure the scattering of two vector bosons. Prospects for measuring the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) vector boson scattering process in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider have been studied using simulated events parameterised to take into account the expected detector effects in the high luminosity environment. With the optimised event selection a total of 2431 signal events are expected, for a background expectation of 1460 events. The cross section for the electroweak production process is extracted from a fit to the dijet invariant mass distribution, and an expected total uncertainty of 6% is achieved for an integrated luminosity of 3000fb\({}^{-1}\). Additionally, the purely longitudinal scattering component can be extracted with an expected significance of \(1.8\sigma\) from a binned likelihood fit to the dijet azimuthal separation distribution.
