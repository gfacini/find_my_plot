**Abstract**

Some properties, of gas calorimeters made of the lead medium and gas idnization tubes under a high pressure (SPACAL - type) are investigated by means of a simulation on the GEANT3.14 code. It is observed that there is a well defined orientation of gas tubes to the beam particle direction at which the calorimeters have a property of the compensation. The characteristics of these calorimeters enable to use it in the bad radiation conditions especially in the region of small angles to the direction of colliding high energy particles.

Hollow tubes.

The simulation of an abstract design of a calorimeter was carried out for the careful investigation of the structure influence of a tubes calorimeter on the amplitude distribution of a signal. A prototype of a lead matrix with embeded rows of ionization gas tubes with a wire collecting electrode was chosen, its crossection is presented in fig.1. For the simulating purposes the size of the prototype was significantly enlarged. To minimize the simulation time the thickness of a tube wall was set to zero and the energy of particles was equal to E= 9 GeV. In the regular structure (fig.1) there are two free parameters for the simulation: - the tube diameter (D); - the distance between central lines of adjacent rows (L).

It is evident that there are some restrictions on values of these parameters. As it is known the electromagnetic shower is almost entirely contained in a cylindre with the radius \(R_{m}\), where \(R_{m}\) - the Moliere radius and is defined as the lateral spread of an electron shower energy:

\[R_{m}=7A/Z(g/cm^{2}).\]

For the lead medium \(R_{m}\approx 1.9\) cm. Therefore it is necessary to fulfil the condition \(D(L)\ll R_{m}\), otherwise the value of an electron signal will depend upon the primary coordinates of incoming particles. As it follows from a design \(D\geq 0.2cm\) and from the condition of minimizing of the signal time scale \(D\leq 0.8cm\).

Some examples of calculated amplitude distributions are presented in figs.2,3 for the calorimeter with D= 0.3 cm and L= 0.55 cm. The gas mixture (\(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\)) is under the pressure P= 30 atm.

In these figures one can see the amplitude distributions for different slope angles between the direction of beam particles and the X-axis (shaded) and the Y-axis (gray background). According to the radial distribution of a registered energy for the shower of particles about 50% of the electron energy is released in a cilinder with the radius R= 0.8 cm (for pion R= 4 cm). Due to the large size of a hadron shower in comparison with the mentioned values D(L) it ignores the calorimeter structure, that is why the hadron amplitude distributions do not depend on the beam slope. At the same time it is not so for electrons because of the small lateral size of their shower. A definite broadening of the amplitude distribution can be seen at the slope angle \(\theta(x)=5^{\circ}\) in comparison with the slope angle \(\theta(y)=5^{\circ}\). One can see well-defined image of the line structure of a tubes calorimeter beginning from the value of a slope angle \(\theta(x)=20^{\circ}\) and greater when the particle shower is disseminated not only along a row of tubes but also between adjacent rows, which is the result of two peaks existing instead of one.

One can see the zero angle cffect when charge particles of a shower are spreaded along the tube axis. As a result there is a long "tail" in the amplitude distribution and a great asymmetry. This effect is absent for big enough slope angles. For hadron amplitude distributions the effect takes place at all values of the angle. It can be explained by a relatively broad angular distribution of shower particles and there are always some charge particles wich travel along a tube axis.

Some examples of the angle slope dependence for the intrinsic energy resolution and the the value of a diameter D in the region 0.3-0.6 cm the value of \(\theta_{min}\) changes in the interval \(5^{\circ}-12^{\circ}\). The forward calorimeter of the EAGLE-detector has to cover the angle region \(0.5^{0}-3.5^{0}\), so it is evident that the value of a compensation parameter for this angle region will not be changed more than by 5%.

The estimate of the angle \(\theta_{min}\) can be obtained from a simple geometric image and is expressed as

\[Sin\theta_{min}=\frac{2*L}{25*X_{0}},\]

where \(X_{0}\) - radiation length of lead. The error of the estimate can be defined as \(1^{\circ}\). In fact, the effective length \({X_{0}}^{eff}\) slightly differs from \(X_{0}\) due to the medium of a tube. But the change of \(\theta_{min}\) in that cause is entirely covered by the angle error. For some reasonable row of values for parameters (L,D) the intrinsic energy resolution and compensation parameter were calculated. These data can be fitted by the next expression:

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)_{e}(\%)=53.12*\frac{L^{1.907}}{D^{1.134}} \tag{2.1}\]

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)_{h}(\%)=5.366+54.78*\frac{L^{1.054}}{D^{0.786}} \tag{2.2}\]

\[\frac{e}{h}=1.086+0.016*\frac{D^{6.185}}{L^{9.9}} \tag{2.3}\]

It was observed that for 30% volume of a gas medium in a calorimeter its full length must not be less than \((35\pm 3)X_{0}\) for electrons to absorbe 99% of primary energy E= 9 GeV and \((9\pm 1)\lambda_{int}\) for hadrons.

## 3 Tubes with the pivots.

For the careful investigation the influence the structure of a tubes with pivots calorimeter on the amplitude distribution of a signal, the simulation an abstract design of a calorimeter was undertaken. It was a prototype of a lead matrix with embeded rows of ionization gas tubes with the thick inner electrode filled a lead. Its crossection is presented in fig.5. This prototype was significantly enlarged. To minimize the simulation time the thickness of the tube walls were set to zero and the energy of particles is equal to E= 9 GeV. Therefore the tube diameter D is an outer diameter of a gas ring being 0.25 cm thick. Free parameters for a simulation are the outer ring diameter D and the distance L between the rows of rings.

One can see some distributions in figs.6,7 obtained for a calorimeter with D= 0.66, L= 1.15 cm. It is necessary to note that the value of the ring diameter D in this case is the minimum one otherwise the further decrease of it will give us a simple hollow tube with a wire. Therefore the structure sizes of a rings calorimeter are always of the same order compared with the characteristic size of an electromagnetic shower (fig.6). As a result there must be a dependence of an amplitude distribution of electrons on the coordinates of the entry point of beam particles into a calorimeter and the energy resolution of a rings calorimeter will be worse than that for a tubes one.

explained by the fact that in one case an electron enters into a row of tubes and in the other it penetrates between these rows; in most cases the line effect is not noticable on the background of the other effect - the coordinate dependence of an electron amplitude; for hadrons both effects are displayed much weaker;

- the value of the compensation parameter e/h is mainly defined by the registration quality of an electromagnetic shower in a calorimeter; the dependence of the parameter on the slope angle of beam particles to the ring axis has a characteristic deep and the minimum value of e/h
- parameter is reached at the bottom of the deep and is close to 1.1;

It is necessary to note that at the value of the variable L close to 2 cm the coordinate dependence of the amplitude is observed also for hadrons. For instance, the mean value of hadron amplitude can change by (5-10)% depending on the value of the slope angle and the entry point of beam particles at E= 9 GeV and the value of the energy resolution changes by (10-15)%. Therefore even for a hadron calorimeter the following condition must be satisfied: \(L\leq 2\) cm.

Supposing that the main condition for a calorimeter is that of the compensation one can conclude that the slope angle of ring axes to the beam particles must be determined by the value of \(\theta_{min}\), where the minimum value of e/h - parameter is reached. From a simple geometrical presentation the value of this angle can be defined as:

\[Sin\theta_{min}=\frac{L+D-0.5}{25*X_{0}},\]

where \(X_{0}\) - the radiation length for lead. The error of the angular estimation can be defined as \(1^{\circ}\). This definition is not unique. Due to the complex structure of tubes two other angular definitions can be suggested depending on the presentation of a regular structure of a calorimeter (only the numerator):

\[(2*L)\mbox{ and }2*(L+D-0.5).\]

The size of the pivot is assumed to be negligable. According to the three angular definitions there are three local minimum in the angular dependence of a compensation parameter, therefore the total width of a deep has to be much greater than that for a tubes calorimeter. The values of an energy resolution and a compensation parameter for the lowest value of \(\theta_{min}\) and for different values of variables (L,D) were calculated. These data can be expressed as:

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)_{e}(\%)=46.5*\frac{L^{2.578}}{D^{2.021}} \tag{3.1}\]

\[\left(\frac{\sigma}{A}\right)_{h}(\%)=29.13+32.04*\frac{L^{1.769}}{D^{0.989}} \tag{3.2}\]

\[\frac{e}{h}=1.106+0.0022*\frac{L^{5.571}}{D^{1.610}} \tag{3.3}\]

It follows from the data that at 15% volume gas content in a calorimeter the value of a corresponding c/h - parameter is greater than that for 30% volume gas content. It can be explained by the relatively large absorption of a hadron shower because of the relatively large values of variables (L,D). The same effect takes place with the increase of a diameter
