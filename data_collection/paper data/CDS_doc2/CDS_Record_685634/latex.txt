_I) Dose Levels Expected in the Barrel Hadron Calorimeter in ATLAS._

The doses given below are taken from the ATLAS LoI (pag. 81) and from the A. Ferrari presentation in the calorimeter working group in July 1992 (CAL-TR-059). They include the dose coming from charged particles and neutrons, considering a mean medium in the calorimeters (LAr/Pb in the e.m. calorimeter and LAr/Iron in the had. calorimeter).

In Fig.1 are given the isodose curves expected in the ATLAS detector per year for an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The step between two isodose curves is 5 Gy, see also table 1. The doses expected in the hadron Barrel calorimeter are given in more detail in fig. 2. The curves drawn on the lego plot correspond to the doses for \(\eta=0\) and \(\eta=1.5\) as a function of the calorimeter depth, with peak doses of 10 Gy/yr and 20 Gy/yr respectively.

### Corrections applied to the dose in the case of a TILECAL Hadron Calorimeter

There are some corrections to be applied to the expected dose in the case of a Hadronic TILECAL calorimeter. The contribution of the neutron fluxes and charged particles to the total dose given above by Ferrari et al. have been calculated considering a mean medium of absorber and active material. In the case of a iron/plastic scintillator calorimeter with a ratio of 4.5 to 1, the dose induced by neutrons and charged particles in the plastic scintillator is higher and has to be corrected for.

### Corrections applied to the doses induced by neutrons

In the development of a hadronic shower a fraction of the energy spent in the form of nuclear excitation (binding energy loss) appears in the form of slow neutrons after nuclear deexcitation and inelastic neutron scattering. Fig. 3a shows the expected neutron energy spectra produced in a hadronic shower induced by a 150 GeV pion incident on 9.7\(\lambda\) of iron [Johns K. at II International Conference On Calorimetry in High Energy Physics at TEXAS 1992]. The main conclusions of this simulation study are that:

* The energy spectra sharply cut off at 1 MeV and peak at a few hundred keV (= 300 keV), approximately independent of the beam momentum and absorber thickness (Fe).
* The integrated flux decreases by about a factor of 1.6 for each additional \(\lambda\), see fig. 3b.
* The flux and energy spectrum of albedo neutrons is roughly equal to the flux and energy spectrum of neutrons at 10 \(\lambda\). For more details see the reference indicated above. Independent studies [Ferrari CAL-TR-059 and CMS LoI pag. 8] show that there seems to be a very little variation of the neutron fluxes along \(\eta\) in the Barrel calorimeters (1.5 \(\leq\eta\leq\) 0) for a fixed depth. These references confirm also the neutron flux reduction with the calorimeter depth.

Neutrons produced in the shower will have a large cross section, \(\sigma_{\rm elast.}\), to elastically scatter off the protons in the plastic, which constitutes the active medium of the TILECAL calorimeter. At 1 MeV (the maximal energy of the neutron spectra (fig. 3a)) the \(\sigma_{\rm elast}\) = \(\sigma_{\rm tot.}\) is about 4 b (see Appendix A, fig. A.1). The neutron capture in Hydrogen is negligible with respect to the elastic scattering in the full energy range ( \(\sigma_{\rm n,\gamma}\) = 0.3 b for thermal neutrons and = 30 \(\mu\)b at 14 MeV (table A.1).

A relation between an integrated neutron fluence \(F_{\rm n}\) (n/cm\({}^{2}\)) and the induced dose deposited in the plastic ( Gy) considering only elastic processes (\(\sigma_{\rm elast}\) in cm\({}^{2}\)) is given by [D. Green FERMILAB-FN-597]:

\[({\rm Dose})_{\rm n}=F_{\rm n}\frac{N_{\rm o}\ \sigma_{\rm elast}}{A}\ \frac{<E>}{2} \tag{1}\]

where N\({}_{\rm o}\) is the number of protons per mass unit (N\({}_{\rm o}\) = 5.2x10\({}^{25}\)kg\({}^{-1}\) in the plastic), A is the atomic number of the nucleus on which the neutron is elastically scattered (A = 1 for the free protons in plastic scintillator) and <E>/2 is the mean energy (in J) of the proton recoil after elastic scattering.

In the case of a mean medium of Fe/LAr (A>> 1) there is a negligible neutron contribution to the total dose. By consequence we assume that the total amount of the doses given previously for a mean medium (fig. 1, 2 and table 1) are only coming from charged particles.

Experimental results of plastic scintillating fibres irradiated with neutrons in a \({}^{235}\)U reactor [A. Maio at the LHC Workshop Aachen, Vol. III, pag. 625) have shown that the degradation in both the light emission and light transmission is the same as that from the equivalent dose of \(\gamma\) irradiation (\({}^{60}\)Co), when similar conversions to eq. 1 are applied to the neutron fluences.

The contribution of neutrons to the doses deposited in the plastic scintillator will be calculated directly from the neutron fluxes expected in the barrel hadron calorimeter. Only the fast (E > 100 keV) fluxes (given in table 1 with a 5 cm polyethylene moderator in front of the LAr e.m. calorimeters, e.g. 1.0x10\({}^{12}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\)) were considered. This value is reduced 14% when the LAr is replaced by plastic in the hadron calorimeter [Ferrari EAGLE Internal Note CAL-NO-005]. As discussed later the slow neutrons have a negligible contribution to the dose, and therefore are not taken into account.

For one year running (10\({}^{5}\)pb\({}^{-1}\)), the expected fast neutron peak flux in the plastic scintillator ((1-0.14)x1.0x10\({}^{12}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\)) corresponds to a peak dose (Dose)\({}_{\rm n}\) = 14.7 Gy/y* if we consider <E> = 1 MeV (eq. 1). This assumption overestimates the dose induced by neutrons. This is illustrated in table 2 where the values of \(\sigma_{\rm elast.}\) x <E> are given for several neutron energies taken from fig. A.1, note that Dose\({}_{\rm n}\)\(\propto\) (\(\sigma_{\rm elast.}\) x <E>). For E\({}_{\rm n}\) < 1 MeV the contribution of neutrons to the dose decreases considerably. For 300 - 400 keV (the energy at which the neutron flux is maximal) the dose induced by neutrons is reduced to 65% with respect to the dose induced by 1 MeV neutrons, which reduction factor will be taken into account. For smaller neutron energies the corresponding dose will be much smaller (table 2). The contribution of the neutrons with E\({}_{\rm n}\)\(\leq\) 100 keV to the dose is then negligible with respect to the fast neutrons, even if we take into account the fact that the flux of the slow neutrons is about 70% of the total neutron flux in the TILECAL hadron calorimeter with a moderator [Ferrari EAGLE Note CAL-NO-005]. In this study the fluence values used are for E\({}_{\rm n}\)\(>\) 100 keV.

#### Corrections applied to the doses induced by charged particles and \(\pi^{0}\)'s.

In a iron/plastic scintillator calorimeter with a ratio of 4 to 1, the dose deposited in the plastic by charged particles (\(\pi^{\pm}\)'s) is higher than the values given for a mean medium of Fe/LAr by a factor roughly proportional to (dE/dx\({}_{\rm scint}\)/dE/dx\({}_{\rm Fe}\)/LAr\({}_{\rm 2}\) = (dE/dx\({}_{\rm scint}\)/dE/dx\({}_{\rm Fe}\). = 1.3. To be conservative we keep the total amount of the doses given previously for a mean medium (fig. 1,2 and table 1) assuming that they are only coming from charged particles. The peak doses in the active medium of the TILECAL hadron calorimeter induced by charged particles are then 11.7 Gy/y and 23.4 Gy/y for \(\eta\) = 0 and \(\eta\) = 1.5 respectively.

For an integrated luminosity of 10\({}^{6}\)pb\({}^{-1}\) (10 years working at a peak luminosity of 1.6x10\({}^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) the expected peak doses from charged particles, neutrons and the total doses (n + \(\pi\)'s) deposited in the plastic scintillator of the TILECAL hadron calorimeter are given on table 3a for \(\eta\) = 0 and \(\eta\)= 1.5 with rather conservative assumptions. The variation of the doses with the hadronic calorimeter depth are shown on table 3b and fig. 4.

_II) Radiation Hardness of a Tile/WLS fibre calorimeter_

To evaluate the light reduction as a function of the dose, the SDC experimental radiation damage results were used, since this is the closest configuration to the TILECAL calorimeter. Intensive tests were performed irradiating in electron beams and \(\gamma\)- \({}^{60}\)Co sources several test modules filled with different tile/fibre combinations [SDC technical proposal (SDC-92-201, pag. 6-31 ; Rad. Phys. Chem. Vol 41, 1993, pag. 263, etc.]. We have chosen experimental results of a typical combination tile/fibre module with a good compromise between a high light yield before irradiation and a good radiation hardness, which is a blue plate SCSN81 combined with a green Y7 fibre*, both from Kuraray. In fig. 5 [SDC-92-201, pag. 6-367 and Yasuoka at the TEXAS calorimetry conference September 1992] is shown the light ratio as a function of the dose in Mrad (1Gy = 100 rad) at the maximum of the shower induced by 2.5 GeV electrons in a SDC module filled with SCSN38/Y7 combination. The data from 3 different modules fit well with a 2 exponential curve:

Footnote *: The BCF91A fibre presently used in the TILECAL test modules has similar radiation hardness when compared with the Y7 fibre type [Yasuoka at the TEXAS calorimetry conference September 1992].

\[\rm{I/I_{o}}=0.824\ e^{-D}/\gamma+0.157\ e^{-D}/\gamma 2 \tag{2}\]

With \(\gamma_{1}=4.3\) Mrad (= 43000 Gy) and \(\gamma_{2}=0.135\) Mrad (= 1350 Gy). With this fit a 1.9% permanent light reduction is given for a zero dose, which was not removed to infer the light reduction after a certain dose. This data were obtained with 11x11 cm\({}^{2}\) plates with 3 mm thickness. Tests have also been done comparing the effect of damage on short and long plates. In fig. 6 [Yasuoka at the TEXAS calorimetry conference, October 1992] a transverse uniformity scan is shown before and after

irradiating a plate/fiber (SCSN81//Y7 fibre) assembly (not a module) in a \({}^{60}\)Co source to 0.6 Mrad (6 kGy). The results are given for a short and long tile of 10.5x10.5 cm\({}^{2}\) and 10.5x22.5 cm\({}^{2}\) respectively, showing a negligible difference between the two plates, within the error bars.

Due to the absence of experimental results concerning irradiation in the exact TILECAL configuration, the results of fig. 5 have been used in this study, to be considered the closest to our case. Using eq. 2 and the results of fig. 4 we estimated the light yield ratio expected on the hadron calorimeter for \(\eta\) = 0 and \(\eta\) = 1.5 after an integrated luminosity of \(10^{6}\)pb\({}^{-1}\). The results are shown on table 4 and fig. 7. We observe that before recalibrating longitudinally each of the 4 cells the light reduction in the first tile (the worst case) is 4.8% for \(\eta\) = 0 and 6.2% for \(\eta\) = 1.5. Assuming that it is possible to know the longitudinal profile of the damage, each of the four longitudinal sectors can be calibrated. The results obtained are given on the last column of table 4a,b. The light ratio in the first tile deviates by 1.1% and 1.8% from the calibration constant in the first sector for \(\eta\) = 0 and for \(\eta\) = 1.5 respectively.

Effect of Radiation Damage on the Performance of the TILECAL hadron calorimeter in the Barrel region.

Jets of 300 GeV have been generated using GEANT and FLUKA in the ATLAS configuration (Accordion Lar/Pb e.m. and TILECAL had. calorimeter), at \(\eta\) = 0. The effect of radiation to the jet energy resolution has been studied. The results of table 4a,b have being used giving to each cell a different weight in order to reproduce the light ratio of each tile after 10\({}^{6}\)Pb-1, either at \(\eta\) = 0 or \(\eta\) = 1.5. In the e.m. calorimeter no degradation due to radiation was considered. Fig. 8 shows the signal distribution for 300 GeV jets at \(\eta\) = 0 (a) before irradiation, (b) after irradiation but without calibration, and (c) after longitudinal calibration. The effect of radiation if we considered the doses expected at \(\eta\) = 1.5 is shown in fig. 9.

Figure 8: The signal distribution for 300 GeV jets generated at \(\eta\) = 0 (a) before irradiation, (b) after irradiation with the doses expected at \(\eta\) = 0, but without longitudinal calibration, and (c) after longitudinal calibration. It was considered the effect after 10\({}^{6}\)pb-1.

We observe that even at \(\eta=1.5\) and without longitudinal calibration the effect of radiation on the jet energy resolution is marginal, as well as in the light reduction. In table 5 are given the values of the increase of the jet energy resolution and light reduction both at \(\eta=0\) and \(\eta=1.5\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\(\eta=0\)} & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{\(\eta=1.5\)} \\ \hline Increase on \(\sigma_{\rm E/E}\) & Signal & Increase on \(\sigma_{\rm E/E}\) & Signal reduction \\ \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{(\%)} & reduction (\%) & (\%) & (\%) \\ \hline without calibration & 0.18 & 1.28 & 0.24 & 1.51 \\ \hline after calibration & 0.10 & 0.10 & 0.16 & 0.14 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Expected degradation of the TILECAL hadron calorimeter performance in the ATLAS configuration obtained by generating 300 GeV jets with GEANT and FLUKA. The values given are for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{6}pb^{-1}\).

Figure 9: The signal distribution for 300 GeV jets generated at \(\eta=0\) (a) after irradiation with the doses expected at \(\eta=1.5\), but without longitudinal calibration, and (b) after longitudinal calibration. It was considered the effect after \(10^{6}pb^{-1}\).
