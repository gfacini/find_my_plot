###### Abstract

FCAL resistors, capacitors, and transformers together with capacitors and sintimid disks of the purity monitor have been irradiated in liquid argon to study their possible lead to argon pollution at a maximal neutron fluence of \(10^{16}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\) at the IBR-2 reactor of JINR, Dubna. The results of charge collection measurements before and after irradiation are reported. Electrical measurement on these FCAL capacitors, resistors and transformers were also performed after irradiation. In general, the results of resistance, capacitance, impedance, leakage current and high voltage breakdown measurements after irradiation show minor changes of value only for some parameters from nominal values or values measured before irradiation.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS Forward Calorimeter (FCAL) with liquid argon as active medium will be exposed to high fluences of particles resulting from head-on collisions of 7 TeV protons at an expected peak luminosity of \(1.0\times 10^{4}\) cm\({}^{-2}\). The FCAL located at high pseudorapidity will be exposed to high fluences equivalent to \(\approx 10^{16}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\) over ten years. Large irradiation level can inflict severe damage to this calorimeter such as mechanical damage to parts of equipment, breakdown of electronics components or deep modifications of their characteristics and pollution of the active layer with electronegative impurities released from the surface of materials and equipment immersed in liquid argon.

The behaviour of materials and equipments of the FCAL electronics chain have been tested in Dubna in conditions similar to those met in the final detector during LHC operation. For that purpose FCAL electronics components were exposed to a 10-year dose, or about, within a period of 11-12 days to be tested for their possible outgassing under irradiation in liquid argon. The stability of their electrical properties after irradiation was also observed. The FCAL electronics components tested were consisting of sets ofresistors, capacitors and transformers. The behaviour under irradiation of a motherboard and connectors was also investigated.

The study was carried on at the fast neutron beam line No. 3 of the IBR-2 reactor of the Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics at Dubna.

## 2 Cold test station at IBR-2 reactor of JINR, Dubna

The cold test station is located at the beam line No. 3 of the IBR-2 pulsed neutron reactor (average power is \(\sim\) 2 MW and about 1500 MW in the pulse) of the Frank Laboratory of Neutron Physics with typical fast neutron ( \(E_{n}>\) 100 keV) fluxes of \(\sim\) 10\({}^{10}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) which are uniform over a large beam geometrical acceptance (\(\sim\) 800 cm\({}^{2}\)) and allow one to achieve, within a period of 11 days, a fluence of 10\({}^{16}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\). The cold test station includes a cryostat of 1 litre and a cryogenic tank with liquid nitrogen for argon liquefaction and continuous feeding of liquid nitrogen during long periods (2-3 weeks). The cryostat containing the samples to be irradiated is installed at the head of a 6m long movable platform and can be transported into the irradiated area of the IBR-2 reactor. A schematic view of the cold test station set-up is shown in Fig. 1. Details about this facility can be found elsewhere [1].

## 3 Neutron activation analysis

A sample of the electronic chain was pre-irradiated at a moderate fluence of 6\(\times\)10\({}^{13}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\) to estimate the activation in view of future handling and possible transportation outside Dubna. The sample was consisting of one resistor, one capacitor, one transformer, a connector and a piece of motherboard. The irradiated sample was analysed by means of a GeLi-detector one day after the exposure. Based on these measurements an estimate has been done of the activity which would be induced by a higher fluence of 1\(\times\)10\({}^{15}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\) requested to be inflicted later to connectors and motherboard. It was determined that one week after an irradiation at a fluence of 1\(\times\)10\({}^{15}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\) a major activity would be caused by the \({}^{110m}\)Ag isotope which has a half-life of 250 days. The following activites would exist on the sample surface (in microRoentgen per hour per sample ):

* 30 \(\mu\)R/h (\({}^{110m}\)Ag
- 249.79 days)
* 80\(\div\)100 \(\mu\)R/h (\({}^{110m}\)Ag
- 249.79 days and \({}^{65}\)Zn
- 244.26 days)
* 800 \(\mu\)R/h (\({}^{110m}\)Ag
- 249.79 days)
* 10000 \(\mu\)R/h (\({}^{82}\)Br
- 35.30 hours and \({}^{124}\)Sb
	- 60.2 days)
* low activity (\({}^{82}\)Br
- 35.30 hours)

For the motherboard one might expect to find chlorine which is often accompanying bromine (Br\({}_{2}\)), both may pollute argon by electro-negative impurities. Although the neutron activation analysis after pre-irradiation demonstrated the absence of chlorine, the decision was taken, however, to perform separate irradiations for electronics components and for connectors and motherboard.

## 4 \(\alpha\)-cell and liquid argon purity monitoring

An ionization chamber (\(\alpha\)-cell) installed in the cryostat is used to check for possible outgassing under irradiation of samples immersed in liquid argon and to monitor the purity of liquid argon. An \({}^{241}\)Am \(\alpha\)-source with an activity of 7.7 k Bq/4\(\pi\) is mounted on the cathode of the \(\alpha\)-cell and high voltages of 0 - 2 kV are applied to the anode. The gap between anode and cathode is 0.7 mm. The electron charge produced by the passage of alpha particles in liquid argon is transported across the cell gap. Further details about the \(\alpha\)-cell, the data taking and their analysis can be found elsewhere [2]. During the experiments, ADC spectra are recorded for various values of the electric field in the range (4 - 29) kV/cm. Then, one may determine the \(\alpha\)-peak position and obtain the electric field dependence of the charge collected at the anode of the \(\alpha\)-cell. The ADC calibration in terms of collected charge allows the conversion of the ADC counts into charge units (fC) for further analysis [2].

The collected charge induced by alpha-particles in liquid argon in the presence of low impurity concentrations (\(<\) 10 ppm of oxygen) may be described as a function of the electric field, E(kV/cm), by:

\[Q(E)=Q_{0}\frac{1}{\xi}ln(1+\xi)Abs(E) \tag{1}\]

where \(Q_{0}=37.1\) fC for an alpha-particle produced in the decay of \({}^{241}\)Am (the alpha-particle mean energy is 5.48 MeV and 23.6 eV are needed to create an electron-ion pair in pure liquid argon). The function \(\frac{1}{\xi}ln(1+\xi)\) represents the initial recombination of electron-ion pairs in pure liquid argon [4] and is assumed to be unaffected by low impurity concentration (\(<\) 10 ppm). In Thomas and Imel's model [4], \(\xi\)E = 470 kV/cm. However, discrepancies between their model and data have led [5] to the use of the empirical formula

\[\xi\,E=a(1-k\,e^{-bE}) \tag{2}\]

where a,b and k are free parameters to be fitted to the data. The values of the three parameters are depending on the experimental set-up. The values a = (720.6\(\pm\) 5.6)kV/cm, b = (0.083 \(\pm\) 0.004)(kV/cm)\({}^{-1}\), and k = (0.48 \(\pm\) 0.01), used to understand the presence of liquid argon pollution, were obtained by fitting \(Q(E)\) data measured before irradiation in October 2000. The function \(Abs(E)\) in eq. (1) is the absorption (or attenuation) factor and is given by the following expression:

\[Abs(E)=\frac{\lambda(E)}{d}(1-e^{-\frac{d}{\lambda(E)}}) \tag{3}\]

\(\lambda\)(E) is the charge carrier absorption length and d is the \(\alpha\)-cell gap. In the case of oxygen pollution with concentration \(\rho\) (ppm), \(\lambda\) is given by:\[\lambda(E)=\alpha E/\rho \tag{4}\]

with \(\alpha=14\) mm\({}^{2}\cdot\)ppm/kV [3].

For comparison between collected charge measurements performed before and after irradiation, a normalization factor \(F_{N}\) is introduced to account for possible miscalibration of the readout charge:

\[\frac{Q(E)}{Q_{0}\frac{1}{\xi}ln(1+\xi)}=F_{N}Abs(E) \tag{5}\]

The value \(F_{N}=(0.997\pm 0.003)\) was found for the \(Q(E)\) data measured before irradiation in October 2000.

Several dedicated measurements of our apparatus sensitivity to oxygen pollution of liquid argon permit to state that the sensitivity is at the level of 0.5 ppm or better.

## 5 Pollution tests of FCAL electronic components

The motherboard and two connectors were irradiated in liquid argon to the fluence of 1.1\(\times 10^{15}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\), as requested. The collected charge measurements before and after irradiation are shown in Fig. 2a.

A first set of FCAL electronics components was investigated. It was consisting of 254 resistors, 252 capacitors and 47 transformers. These components were immersed in liquid argon and irradiated to a fluence of 1.1\(\times 10^{15}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\). The collected charge measured before and after irradiation is shown in Fig. 2b as a function of the electric field.

Both figures show a very good agreement between the collected charge measured before and after irradiation and indicate no sign of pollution due to that level of irradiation.

In a subsequent run, performed one year later, 72 resistors and 75 capacitors, representing components of FCAL electronics were immersed in the liquid argon cryostat with 5 capacitors and 6 stimtimid disks of the LARG purity monitor and irradiated to a requested fluence of (1.0\(\pm\)0.1)\(\times 10^{16}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\). This sharing with components of the purity monitor was decided to accommodate another test requested by the LARG Collaboration and to help the reduction of the total number of run campaigns at the facility.

The collected charge was measured as a function of the electric field \(E\) before irradiation and compared to the collected charge measured one, two, three days after the end of irradiation (Fig. 2c). This figure shows very good agreement between the measurements of the collected charge before and after irradiation. Furthermore, Fig. 2c also shows the good stability of the system response over a period of 3 days after irradiation. Figure 2d shows the ratio as a function of the electric field \(E\) between the charge measured three days after irradiation at a fluence of 1.0\(\times 10^{16}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\) and the charge measured before irradiation for the FCAL and purity monitor components. The ratio is consistent with unity and shows that no outgassing, as a result of irradiation, is observable.

Fitting Eqs. (1)-(4) to the data obtained from the charge measurement before and three days after the end of irradiation gave \(\rho=(0.00\pm\)0.02) ppm and (0.00\(\pm\)0.03) ppm, respectively. These results permit to state, within the limit of sensitivity of our apparatus,the absence of sizable pollution after irradiation to a fluence of 10\({}^{16}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\), confirming the direct comparison (Fig. 2d) of the collected charges.

## 6 Electrical tests of FCAL electronics components

### Measurement procedures

The measurement of electrical characteristics of resistors, capacitors and transformers was performed. The values measured after irradiation were compared to nominal values as provided by the manufacturer or those measured before the irradiation.

The resistance measurements were performed using a digital multimeter, model 2000, product of KEITHLEY [6], which has a resolution of 1\(\Omega\) over the range of 1 M\(\Omega\). The multimeter was used in the working mode where the resistance value was shown as the average of 100 measurements. Such measurements were done 3 times and the average over these measurements was used as the final value. That last procedure was used due to very high resolution of the multimeter.

The capacitance measurements were performed using a bridge voltmeter [7]. The device has a sensitivity of 10\({}^{-3}\) nF when 4-wires connection of the capacitors was used. Before each cycle of capacitance measurements "the zero" of the device was adjusted manually. To minimize the influence of industrial noises and parasitic leakages on the capacitance value, the average value of capacitance over three measurements was calculated.

To check the capacitors leakage current, the approach consisted in measuring [8] the capacitors charge current through very precise thermostabilized resistance (R = 958195\(\pm\)3 \(\Omega\)). A high voltage source CAEN, type N-126, and the KEITHLEY multimeter with a sensitivity of 10\({}^{-4}\) mV were used. Again the values used for the leakage current were the values averaged over 100 measurements and those values were renewed every 3.5 seconds. The use of the multimeter in this mode permitted the estimate of the dynamics of capacitors at a voltage up to 1 kV and the measurement of the current in a stationary regime.

The inductances of primary and secondary windings were measured with a Tesla RLCG-Bridge voltmeter of 0.01 \(\mu\)H sensitivity. The leakage current between both windings was measured following the same procedure as used for the measurement of the capacitors leakage current, but the capacitor edge windings were connected to the KEITHLEY multimeter.

The systematic error on leakage current measurement for both capacitors and inductances was estimated at the level of 60pA.

### Electrical tests after irradiation at fluence of 10\({}^{15}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\)

The electrical characteristics of the set of 254 resistors, 252 capacitors and 47 transformers were measured after their irradiation in liquid argon to a fluence of 1.1\(\times\)10\({}^{15}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\).

Late delivery prevented the measurement of their electrical characteristics before irradiation. Therefore, the values measured after irradiation were compared to nominal values as provided by the manufacturer.

The set of 254 resistors were tested after their irradiation in liquid argon. Only one unit could not withstand a high voltage of 550 volts applied for one minute. Two average values of measured resistance were found \(1.001\pm 0.0003\)\(M\Omega\) and \(1.010\pm 0.0003\)\(M\Omega\), both in good agreement with the nominal value of \(1.00\)\(M\Omega\) (Fig. 3). These two values seems to correspond to two batches of resistors within the set of 254 resistors. Thirty units have shown a resistance value larger than the nominal resistance by more than one percent. More results are reported in Table 1.

The set of 252 capacitors were tested after their irradiation in liquid argon. The measured average capacitance was \(11.9\pm 0.2\) n F as reported in Fig. 4. The value is quite consistent with the nominal capacitance of \(12.0\pm 0.6\) nF. The average leakage current at 1000 V was \(1.3\pm 0.9\) nA (Fig. 5) while 14 units failed this power test with a leakage current greater than 10 \(\mu\)A. Other results are reported in Table 1.

The set of 47 transformers were tested after their irradiation in liquid argon. The average induction of primary and secondary windings was \(0.038\pm 0.005\) mH (Fig. 6a) and \(0.7\pm 0.1\) mH (Fig. 6b), respectively. The ratio of secondary loop inductance to primary loop inductance is shown in Fig. 6c. No transformer failed the high voltage test (HV = 50 V). The average leakage current between windings at 50V was found to be \(83\pm 14\) pA (Fig. 7).

A summary of the results of the measurements of the resistors, capacitors and transformers done after irradiation are reported in Table 1 where they are compared to nominal values when available.

### Electrical tests after irradiation at fluence of \(10^{16}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\)

A second set of electronics components was studied on October 2000. This set was consisting of 216 resistors and 233 capacitors. These components were delivered to Dubna well ahead the irradiation start-up, and it was possible to subject them to a series of measurements prior to irradiation.

For the resistors, the value of the resistance was measured and the color of the resistor surface was noted (Table 2).

The capacitors were subjected to a voltage of 1 kV. The value of capacitance and leakage current were measured at that voltage. The capacitors were also tested for voltage breakdown. The type of imperfection was noted such as dial failure, arcing with or without short, increase of leakage current. The color of the capacitor surface was also registered (Table 2).

From this pre-irradiation set of measurements, eleven capacitors were rejected for further studies because of their high leakage current, 5 times larger than the average leakage current measured for the whole set of capacitors, i.e. larger than 6 nA.

After these preliminary measurements were performed, all remaining components were distributed among three groups, with an approximately equal number of resistors and capacitors - about 70 components of each kind.

The components of the first group (72 resistors and 75 capacitors - group 1) were immersed in the liquid argon cryostat and subsequently irradiated at a requested fluence of (1.0\(\pm\)0.1)\(\times\)10\({}^{16}\) n cm\({}^{-2}\).

The components of the second group (72 resistors and 73 capacitors - group 2) were irradiated at room temperature (in "warm" conditions) at the same fluence as the first group. These conditions could eventually allow the check for possible annealing effects on the leakage current comparing the leakage currents of group 1 and 2 measured after irradiation.

A third group of components was selected to achieve, at the end of the study, a survey of the behaviour of the electronic components subjected to a complete set of conditions: irradiation in cold and "warm" condition, no irradiation and then to compare the measurements of capacitance, resistance, leakage currents, color stability and breakdown voltages for all conditions. Then, the components of the third group (72 resistors and 74 capacitors - group 3) were not irradiated but immersed in a cryostat filled with liquid nitrogen and kept out of neutron exposure for a period of eleven days during which group 1 and group 2 were irradiated. These components were taken out of liquid nitrogen at the end of the 11 days period and kept in "warm" conditions. Their electrical measurements were done at room temperature.

The electrical measurements of the irradiated components (group 1 and group 2) were performed one month after the end of the irradiation when the induced activity had dropped down to 5.6 mR/hour.

After the irradiation, the surface of resistors from group 1 and group 2 appeared light yellow colored while the color of the capacitor surface appeared green metallic. However, one month after the measurements, the original colors of those components were practically completely restored. The resistance values (Figure 8) are not affected by any conditions and the mean values are unchanged within 1%. The same conclusion is true for the capacitors for which the measured capacitance values for all groups and conditions are the same with an average value of about 11.6 \(\pm\) 0.2 nF (Fig. 9).

The results of the measurements of the capacitors leakage currents are shown in Fig. 10. It is clearly visible from Fig. 10 that the leakage current increases after irradiation. The leakage current of the capacitors irradiated in "warm" conditions is two times larger than the value measured before irradiation. For the capacitors irradiated in cold conditions, the distribution of the leakage currents measured after irradiation is much flatter with a mean value increased by 6% higher compared to the the value measured before irradiation.

The breakdown voltage has been measured for the capacitors of the three groups. An average value of the breakdown voltage is found to be about 3.3-4.0 kV for the three groups (Fig. 11). The breakdown voltage decreases after irradiation. The mean value shifts down by \(\sim\) 4% and \(\sim\)1% for the capacitors irradiated in liquid argon and in "warm" conditions, respectively.

The type of capacitor breakdown was studied by slow manual increase of the high voltage applied to the capacitors, up to trip occurrence. Three types of events were observed: failure of the capacitor dielectric, arcing between electrodes, and finally continuous increase of leakage current.

The results of the electric measurements of the FCAL electronic components before and after irradiation in the various conditions are summarized in Table 2.
