###### Abstract

A high precision one dimensional alignment scheme for the muon detector is discussed. Up to now it was used in the detectors with solenoidal magnetic field. To realise this scheme in the case of the toroidal magnetic field a projective geometry with straight towers is a more suitable solution for the muon detector's structure. Design of main parts of the Projective Muon Detector with superconducting air toroid magnet is proposed.

## 1 Introduction

This proposal has aim to do the next step 1 in an optimisation of the muon detector design (air toroid option of the ASCOT/EAGLE project, [1]). The muon detector costs near 1/3 of the whole sum. So some improvements and new ideas can produce a meaningfull effect.

Footnote 1: After LOI now

Our optimisation starts from simplification of an alignment scheme and is based on technology and design of existing ASCOT project. Now there is a common understanding that high precision alignment is the most important problem for the muon detector design.

We try to imagine design of the muon detector which provides an alignment of all signal wires in the tower's reference frame with an accuracy \(\delta<<\delta r\) so to exclude it's contribution into resulting error of the muon momentum determination.

For simplicity we consider the scheme when sagitta of curved track is calculated from the coordinate values of three points which are measured by three modules (superlayers of the muon detector ). The neighbouring modules towers are overlapped. We suppose that each module is a package of 4 - 8 layers of drift tubes and measures the distance from the charged particle track to it's signal wires with a summary accuracy \(\delta r=20-30\) microns.

Projective Muon Detector

### Why "projective"?

We are speaking about the projective geometry of the muon detector only in the context of momentum measurement of the highest energy muons (more then 50 GeV). In a real magnetic field the tracks of such particles are near by straight lines coming from the common vertex. So from the point of view of the detector design it can be composed from the separate "projective towers" which are working individualy as a magnetic spectrometers. The pattern recognition and the muon trigger systems are based on the tower structure also.

Many other subdetectors suppose to have projective geometry. If in the whole detector it will be done coherently it will play an important role in the general trigger system.

### "Straight" or "inclined" towers?

For collider experiments it is rather natural to divide detector in some sectors in the azimutal (\(XY\)) plane.

The sector itself in case of toroidal magnetic field can be divided in two ways, see fig.1 :

a) inclined towers - the module planes are parallel to \(Z\) axis (it is a collider beams direction) in the barrel region and perpendicular to \(Z\) axis in the endcap regions;

b) straight towers - all module planes are perpendicular to own radius-vectors started from the interaction point.

Fig.2 illustrates mesurement of sagitta for inclined track. Fig.3 (see definitions) show values of alignment accuracies, \(\delta x_{a}\) and \(\delta y_{a}\), as function of the \(\theta\) when their contributions into summary error are equal and comparable with the error \(\delta r\) from the drift time measurement. _Note_ that \(\delta x_{a}\) and \(\delta y_{a}\) are the summary position accuracies of signal wires in the reference frame of the tower.

So, case (a) is a magnetic spectrometer with large \(\theta\) angle acceptance. In the measurement plane \(\phi=const\) for the values of angle between track direction and normal to module's plane in range of \(\theta=20^{\circ}-70^{\circ}\) we need a high accuracy alignment in two directions (\(\delta x_{a}\approx\delta y_{a}\), fig.3).

We propose to use the case (b) - set of magnetic spectrometers with small \(\theta\) angle acceptance. For \(\theta\leq 5^{\circ}\) we can neglect by \(\delta y_{a}\) (it can be 10 times more then \(\delta x_{a}\)!). The straight towers, like fig.4, structure of the Projective Muon Detector provides one dimensional alignment both in between signal wires inside module and between modules inside the tower as well.

_Note_ that in a solenoid magnetic field the azimutal division of detector automaticaly leads to the "straight towers" structure and as a consequence to the one dimensional superalignment scheme (see the L3 muon detector). And a problem with two dimensional alignment arises only in the case of the toroidal magnetic field.

### 2.3 MODULE: high accuracy "mechanic" or "measurement"?

There are some proposals for multilayer module made of the drift tubes. They hope to attain a high precision spacing of the sensitive wires in the module by using a traditional high precision mechanical design.

In our case the mechanical structure of the module is demanded to be only a rigid and stable support for sensitive wires. It provides also an approximate knowledge about wire spacing with moderate accuracy. A high precision accuracy (10 - 20 microns) will be achived by means of a "coordinate calibration" measurement procedure. The coordinate calibration data for each wire are stored in a computer memory as a usual detector calibration constants accessible by the off- or on-line software.

From the point of view of mass production we follow two main principles:

(a) Each sensitive element of the detector must be tested under working conditions so that modules are mounted from selected elements.

(b) It is better to have one complex and high precision measurement device for production of thousand cheap modules than to produce thousand high precision mechanical devices.

### 2.4 AIR TOROID: "cylindrical" or "spheroidal"?

Magnet system is a part of the muon detector. The air super conducting magnet's design adjusted to the Projected Muon Detector is presented, fig.5. We use the ASCOT barrel magnet technology. The magnet has only two parts, each 14 meters of length. Super conducting coils are mounted on large Al membranes inside own cryostats. But near the beam the cryostats have a common conical volume.

To overcome limitation on total current in the magnet system that goes from critical value of the magnet field in the nearest to beam points of coils we have two sets of coils, fig.6. Eight coils have full length and other eight are more short.

Preliminary estimation for value of the banding power as function of pseudo-rapidity value \(\eta\) is illustriated on fig.7.

## 3 R&D, DESIGN

Of course, all R & D activity with design of drift tubes, module and high accuracy light spot detector started this year [3] are very usefull. But for realisation of this proposal we need some more research:(a) Measurement of wire positions in the module -

Successful measurements of sensitive wire positions inside package of Al drift tubes by X-ray method was made last year in Dubna, [3]. This method (the simplist Tomograph ) can be used for the one dimensional coordinate calibration of drift tube modules with any wire spacers inside. It will be nice to continue this R & D so to produce a working prototype.

There is also proposal of the coordinate calibration by an optic tools in Dubna, [4].

(b) Design of the module -

In the frame of the "coordinate calibration" idea it can be rather simple. But still there are many problems with rigidity of module and with it's support.

(b) Light spot position detector -

We suppose to have in the module an active reference marks (light spot detectors) that can be used as reference system for the coordinate calibration of module itself and for alignment between modules in the tower. On the contrary to the known L3-scheme we propose to have an alignment channel with rather big acceptance (\(\approx 1cm^{2}\)) to monitor small displacements of the drift tube modules. The base elements of this channel are laser, CCD matrix, optic fibers, lenses and prizms.

(c) Design of the magnet -

Is it possible to combine the barrel and endcap coils?

Is it possible to have a cavern so big for moving every part of the magnet?

Is it possible to resolve the problem of an overlapping in the middle superlayer of the muon detector?

Is it possible to mount every part of the Projective Muon Detector (magnet with modules) in the surface building?

[The author knows well that the magnet design is the most weak point of this proposal. This work cann't be done without experts.]

## 4 Conclusion

In the ASCOT/EAGLE project the air toroid magnetic field is proposed as a tool to achive the highest possible accuracy for the muon momentum measurements. It is seems for us that the 20 microns accuracy alignment of the drift tube's signal wires for detector with common area \(\approx 6000m^{2}\) is so difficult problem that we have to examine an opportunity of the straight tower muon detector also.

An advantage of using the one dimensional scheme of an alignment is more then factor 2. It increases by an order of magnitude the possibility to achive our aim. It opens a way for the mass production of cheap drift tube detectors. Of course, the straigt tower structure of the muon detector can be realised in the existing cylindrical toroidal magnet.

On the basis of straight towers the selfconsistent design of the Projective Muon Detector can be achieved. Any collaboration on this way is welcomed.
