**Prospects for early \(t\bar{t}\) resonance searches in ATLAS**

The ATLAS collaboration

###### Abstract

Searches for signatures of new physics in \(t\bar{t}\) events at the LHC require efficient reconstruction of top quarks with a broad range of transverse momenta. Three new reconstruction schemes are developed to deal with the large variety of top decay topologies. Their performance on the lepton \(+\) jets final state is evaluated using a detailed simulation of signal and background processes. Compared to previous ATLAS studies, a much improved reconstruction efficiency is found over a large \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) range. As a consequence, the sensitivity to \(t\bar{t}\) resonances in the \(\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\,\) regime is enhanced considerably. Even in the earliest phase of the experiment, with an integrated luminosity of less than 1 \(\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\,\) at a reduced centre-of-mass energy of 7\(\,\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\), ATLAS is expected to significantly extend the mass reach of existing searches.

Introduction

The LHC, after its start-up in autumn 2009, is beginning to explore a new energy regime. With two proton beams accelerated to 3.5 TeV, and ultimately 7 TeV, the centre-of-mass energy of the colliding partons will reach well beyond a TeV. One of the most exciting prospects is the possibility to observe unknown particles. The top quark, the heaviest known particle, may play a crucial role in unravelling the New Physics that awaits discovery. Many new physics models predict new resonances strongly coupled to the top quark [1, 2, 3].

New states beyond the Standard Model are experimentally constrained by precision electro-weak data from the LEP experiments and SLD and directly by resonance searches at the Tevatron. Di-lepton resonance searches lead to tight constraints: the lower limit on the mass of a heavy counterpart to the Standard Model Z-boson (sequential \(Z^{\prime}\) ) is approximately 1 TeV [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. While resonance searches in \(q\bar{q}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) final states lead to less severe constraints on the sequential \(Z^{\prime}\) boson [9, 10, 11, 12], they lead to strong constraints on models involving coloured objects. Lower limits on the mass of new states like excited quarks (\(qg\to q^{*}\)) [13, 14], axigluons [15] and colorons [16] in the range from 600 GeV to 1200 GeV are derived from di-jet searches. Similarly, the value of \(t\bar{t}\) resonance searches is primarily to constrain models where the top quark acquires a special role in the predicted phenomenology. A well-known example is the lepto-phobic resonance in topcolor [17] models, that is constrained by the Tevatron results. A more recent proposal envisages a heavy partner to the gluon in certain models with extra spatial dimensions [18, 19]. The Kaluza Klein (KK) gluon does not couple to leptons, and the quarks of the third family are strongly favoured over light quarks, so that discovery relies predominantly on the \(t\bar{t}\) signature.

The potential of resonance searches in the ATLAS experiment [20] was shown to extend the mass reach of direct searches well into the multi-TeV domain [21]. More recently, the sensitivity of early searches in the di-lepton and di-jet final states has been evaluated [22], showing that ATLAS may be competitive with the existing limits very early on in the experiment. In this note the prospects are evaluated for early \(t\bar{t}\) resonance searches, with an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) to 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and a reduced centre-of-mass energy (7 or 10 TeV). Results are reported from a full Monte Carlo study were using the detailed detector model and sophisticated reconstruction software developed by the experiment 1).

A number of benchmark models that represent important classes of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) models that give rise to \(t\bar{t}\) resonances was defined for this study. In section 2 the Monte Carlo signal samples used for this study are introduced. The Standard Model processes that constitute the most important backgrounds are also listed.

The large centre-of-mass energy of the LHC, key to the mass reach of resonance searches, also gives rise to a severe experimental challenge. In \(t\bar{t}\) events produced through a heavy resonance, the top quarks have a transverse momentum that is large compared to their mass. Classical top reconstruction algorithms, used at the Tevatron and envisaged for mass and cross-section measurements at the LHC, are not adequate to deal with highly boosted top decay topologies. The challenges faced when attempting to reconstruct the complete \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass spectrum are discussed in some detail in section 3.

The ATLAS top reconstruction algorithms have been adapted to cope with the different \(t\bar{t}\) topologies. Two classical algorithms are adapted to extend their range of applicability into the TeV regime. The alternative approach to top reconstruction tailored to highly boosted tops described in references [18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27] and [28, 29, 30] has led to a third algorithm. These algorithms are discussed in section 4. New full simulation results for their performance, in terms of reconstruction efficiency, background rejection and mass resolution, are presented in section 5.

With these new techniques, the ATLAS potential for \(t\bar{t}\) resonance searches is revisited, with a strong focus on early data. The statistical treatment has been extended to include resonances with a non-negligible width. The expected sensitivity to resonant \(t\bar{t}\) production of an analysis of early ATLAS data is presented in section 6. The most important findings are summarised in section 7. The consequences of this new result in different early LHC scenarios are also discussed in this section.

The scope of this discussion is limited in many ways. The reported analyses focus on the semi-leptonic decay mode of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair, leaving the fully leptonic and fully hadronic modes for a future analysis. More exotic possibilities like the search for new physics in \(tt\) or \(\overline{t}\bar{t}\) final states [31] are not considered here. Preference is furthermore given to a more straightforward resonance search rather than the more powerful analysis unfolding the full \(t\bar{t}\) spectrum, like the determination of the partial cross-section \(\delta\sigma/\delta m_{t\bar{t}}\) recently performed by CDF [32]. By the same token, observables like the charge asymmetry [33] or observables related to top polarisation [34, 35, 36] that potentially yield more powerful handles on new physics are not discussed at this stage.

## 2 Benchmarks and Monte Carlo samples

ATLAS has defined several benchmark BSM setups. Masses in the range 0.5-2 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) are chosen to explore the regime that could be accessible to early searches.

The first samples correspond to a narrow resonance that is representative for colour-neutral \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons in a large range of models. Such states are typically narrow compared to the experimental resolution (\(\Gamma/m\sim 2.7\) % for a sequential \(Z^{\prime}\) boson). The natural width can then be neglected with respect to the experimental mass resolution and a model independent limit can be derived [10, 11, 12]. The production cross-section for a 1 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) resonance is of the order of 15 pb, and the branching ratio is approximately 11 %, leading to a rate of \(\sigma\times BR(X\to t\bar{t})=1.6\) pb at 14 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). The properties indicated here correspond to the sequential \(Z^{\prime}\) boson, that has identical couplings to the SM Z boson, but are representative for a broad range of \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons in a wide variety of models [37, 38, 39, 40]. One exception is formed by the topcolor assisted technicolor model of reference [17]. With its significantly enhanced rate into \(t\bar{t}\) pairs, \(\sigma\times BR(X\to t\bar{t})=6.6\) pb for \(m=1\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) at 14 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\), it could be within reach of LHC searches relatively early. Samples were produced for several masses between 0.5 and 2 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). The 1 and 2 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) points were processed using the detailed _full_ simulation, while intermediate mass points were generated with the ATLAS _fast_ simulation [41]. Further samples were produced where the \(Z^{\prime}\) decays to \(u\bar{u}\), \(c\bar{c}\) and \(b\bar{b}\) pairs. While such decay modes are largely irrelevant for searches, these samples provide a reference for background rejection studies.

The spin-2 graviton in Extra-Dimension models [42] is very narrow and may be produced at a similar rate as the \(Z^{\prime}\) bosons: \(\sigma\times BR(X\to t\bar{t})=2.0\) pb for \(k/M_{Pl}=0.1\) and \(m=1\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) at 14 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). Two samples

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c} \hline sub-sample & cross-section times branching ratio \(X\to t\bar{t}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=10\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) \\ \hline \(Z^{\prime}\), \(\Gamma/m=3.4\) \% & \\ \hline \(m=0.5\)-2 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) & \(\sim 750\) fb for sequential \(Z^{\prime}\) with \(m=1\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) \\ \hline KK graviton [42], \(m=1\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) & \\ \hline \(k/M_{Pl}=0.1\) & 600 fb \\ \(k/M_{Pl}=0.01\) & 6.0 fb \\ \hline KK gluon, basic RS setup [19] & \\ \hline \(m=1\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) & 4.0 pb \\ \(m=1.5\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) & 0.62 pb \\ \(m=2\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) & 0.14 pb \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

were generated, primarily to evaluate the effect of the spin on the extracted limits.

The third class of models envisages a new state that is charged under the strong interaction. Such coloured states may be produced much more abundantly. The KK excited state of the gluon with a mass of 1 TeV in the basic Randall-Sundrum (RS) setup of reference [19] has a cross-section of 30 pb at 14 TeV [19]. With a branching ratio into \(t\bar{t}\) pairs of 92.5 %, this model predicts a rather spectacular signal 2. For such broad resonances, the width must be explicitly taken into account to interpret the result, as in references [47, 48]. Events have been generated in MADGRAPH [49] (MadGraph/MadEvent version 4.4.3) up to the level of the top quark and W boson decay products. The topBSM model (version 1.3) for a generic spin-1, colour octet resonance has been used, with the model-specific parameters of the KK gluon in the basic RS setup [19]. The events are then further processed using PYTHIA 6.417 [50].

Footnote 2: It is noted that in this type of RS models current experimental data yield a lower bound of approximately 2-3 TeV on the mass of the KK gluon. Experimental bounds are partially softened by invoking custodial symmetries [43, 44, 45], but in this type of models a KK gluon mass below 2 TeV is very difficult to reconcile with electroweak precision measurements from LEP. A complete discussion of the experimental bounds on warped 5D models is found in [46] and references therein.

To evaluate the early physics potential of the ATLAS experiment, signal and background samples were generated at centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV. The samples are listed in table 1. Due the reduced parton luminosity at this centre-of-mass energy, the cross-sections in the table are considerably smaller than the 14 TeV values in the literature.

Standard Model background samples were generated for the most relevant background processes. Samples for Standard Model \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top production were generated with MC@NLO [51, 52] (version 3.31). The cross-section for \(t\bar{t}\) production corresponds to 203 pb for events involving at least one lepton from W-boson decay and 171 pb for fully hadronic events. Single-top production yields cross-sections of 43 and 14 pb for t-channel and associated production, respectively. For the \(\mathrm{W+N}\) jets and QCD multi-jet samples ALPGEN 2.13 [53] and PYTHIA 6.417 [50] were used.

To emulate the detector response all generated events were processed with the standard ATLAS simulation 3. This package, based on GEANT4 [54], simulates the interactions of all final state particles with a detailed representation of the ATLAS detector. The detector geometry and material description correspond to the nominal detector geometry, i.e. a perfectly aligned detector.

Footnote 3: This is true for all background samples and nearly all signal samples. The only exception is formed by the intermediate mass points for the \(Z^{\prime}\) signal mentioned before.

Due to the large multiplicity of \(t\bar{t}\) decay products, the average transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) of final state objects is rather moderate: for the \(Z^{\prime}\) mass range considered here, jet and lepton \(p_{T}\) is typically in the range from 100-200 GeV. In this regime, the Monte Carlo description of such objects is expected to be reliable. At the time of writing, the commissioning of the novel observables used in some analyses is being performed on the data samples collected so far.

## 3 Reconstruction of boosted \(t\bar{t}\) topologies

Resonance searches require the reconstruction of a large section of the \(t\bar{t}\) mass spectrum. Previous Monte Carlo studies [22] have revealed that the reconstruction efficiency of standard top reconstruction algorithms degrades rapidly with increasing top quark transverse momentum (or resonance mass). In this section, this problem is analysed and several solutions are presented.

The topology of \(t\bar{t}\) events changes considerably when moving from the low end (\(m_{t\bar{t}}=2m_{t}\)) of the spectrum to the multi-TeV regime. For tops produced at rest the decay products are typically well separated. If the top quarks are produced through a heavy resonance, on the other hand, the top decay products tend to be emitted in a "back-to-back" topology. The boost of the top quark leads to a significant probability that its decay products overlap. Finally, in the limit where the top transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) is much larger than its mass, a mono-jet topology is obtained. The top quark boost is such that its decay products are collimated in a narrow cone. Jet algorithms with standard distance criteria are no longer able to resolve the individual partons and reconstruct the hadronic decay as a single top mono-jet. Similarly, the lepton from the leptonically decaying top quark is embedded in the jet and is no longer isolated.

To put this rather schematic discussion on a more quantitative basis, a parton-level study has been performed on a test sample with an approximately uniform population over a large \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass range ( \(2m_{t}<m_{t\bar{t}}<2.5\) TeV). The probability that the partons from a hadronic top decay are found within a given \(\Delta R\) distance of 0.8, is shown in figure 1(a). Clearly, the resolved topology (no partons merge) dominates for \(t\bar{t}\) events produced at rest. For a \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass greater than approximately 700 GeV the partially merged topology takes over. The mono-jet topology only becomes dominant for masses beyond 1.7 TeV (\(<p_{T}^{\prime}>=600\) GeV). By varying the cone size, the relative frequency of each topology is altered. An increase of the \(\Delta R\) distance to 1.6 brings the 50 % point of the mono-jet approach down to approximately 800 GeV. For any choice of the distance a significant fraction of the events in the test sample is classified in the partially merged topology: 32 % for \(\Delta R=0.8\), 46 % for \(\Delta R=1.4\) and 40 % for \(\Delta R=1.6\). This result clearly shows that a complete reconstruction of the \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass distribution has to deal with very different topologies. In the \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass range between approximately 500 GeV and 1.5 TeV, called transition region in this note, algorithms have to cope with a mixture of topologies.

The topology of the event can be identified on the basis of the substructure of the jets. The jet invariant mass, calculated on all topological calorimeter clusters belonging to the jet, provides a very sensitive measure. The jet invariant mass distribution of the leading (anti-\(k_{T}\), \(R=0.8\)) jet after \(p_{T}\) ordering is shown in figure 1(b). Each event is classified as belonging to the resolved, partially merged or fully merged topology on the basis of the \(\Delta R\) matching of the quarks to reconstructed jets as in the previous section. For the partially merged topology events where the quarks from the W boson decay merge (qq') are moreover distinguished from events where the overlap is between one quark from the W-decay and the b-quark (bq). The distribution for each of these topologies is indicated on the same figure. The three topologies clearly populate different intervals of the jet mass distribution. While the resolved topologies are concentrated at very low jet mass, for events where two or three quarks merge the W and top mass peaks are clearly visible. The topology of the event can be estimated by dividing the invariant mass distribution in three intervals. The estimated topology maps cleanly onto the topology

Figure 1: Probability that the three partons from a hadronic top decay are found within a \(\Delta R\) distance of 0.8 (a). The red squares indicate the probability that no partons merge, the green triangles that two partons merge, but the third remains well separated, and the blue triangles that all three partons merge. Reconstructed invariant mass of the leading jet (anti-\(k_{T}\) on topological calorimeter clusters, with R=0.8) in \(pp\to X\to t\bar{t}\to\text{lepton}+\text{jets}\) events (b).

obtained on the basis of the \(\Delta R\) distance between partons. In more than 80 % of events both criteria agree (this is true for values of \(R\) between 0.4 and 1.0). The invariant mass of the leading jet can therefore be used to determine the topology of the event and select the most appropriate scheme to combine the jets into top and anti-top quark candidates. This idea has been implemented in two ATLAS algorithms, that will be presented in section 4.

## 4 Reconstruction algorithms

The ATLAS sensitivity to \(t\bar{t}\) resonances was studied in the past with an adapted version of one of the algorithms intended for the top mass measurement [22]. This algorithm aims primarily at the topology where all final state partons lead to a cleanly resolved jet. This study clearly identified the main weakness of resolved algorithms: the reconstruction efficiency drops rapidly with increasing invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair, thus limiting the sensitivity of searches for heavy resonances.

The algorithms labelled as _transition region_ algorithms aim at an efficient reconstruction of the mixture of topologies present in the invariant mass regime around 1 TeV. A key asset of these algorithms is that they are able to reconstruct a large section of the \(t\bar{t}\) spectrum. In particular, their sensitivity starts from the production threshold (\(m_{t\bar{t}}=2m_{t}\) ) and includes the mass range tested at the Tevatron. Two approaches, labelled minimal and full reconstruction, have been investigated. In section 4.2 and 4.3, the adaptation of these two algorithms to deal with boosted topologies is discussed.

Many of the ideas developed recently to deal with the large \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) regime have been implemented [30]. These efforts have led to a versatile ATLAS algorithm for reconstruction and identification of _top monojets_. The mono-jet algorithm is presented in section 4.4. The three algorithms discussed in this note use, to a large extent, the same set of input objects. These are described in section 4.1.

### Common definition of input objects

The three reconstruction algorithms apply a pre-selection to select events with well-reconstructed low-level objects. All analyses require a high-quality lepton to be reconstructed. Combined muon candidates, with a matching track in the muon system and the tracker, are required to have a transverse momentum of at least 20 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Electron candidates of medium quality are accepted if their transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) is greater than 25 GeV. Electron candidates beyond \(|\eta|=2.47\) and in the crack region (\(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)) are excluded. All analyses make use of a cut on missing transverse energy, to require the presence of an escaping neutrino. The minimal cut is 20 GeV, and this requirement is tightened for some analyses. The energy deposit from a high-\(p_{T}\) electron gets considered in the jet finding, which can lead to an extra jet for isolated electrons and electron-jet merging for electrons in or close to jets. Special care has to be taken to remove the overlap between the reconstructed sets of electron candidates and jets, especially in boosted topologies where the electron from W-decay may merge with the nearby b-jet. The transition region algorithms (minimal and full) remove jets within \(\Delta R<0.2\) of an electron. Finally to remove non-prompt muons from semi-leptonic B-hadron decays, muons which overlap with selected jets within \(\Delta R<0.3\) of a jet are removed.

### Minimal reconstruction

The minimal reconstruction approach is designed for \(t\bar{t}\) resonance searches in the early stage of the experiment. It is based on an algorithm successfully applied at DO [55]. The strategy is based on a very small number of observables that require minimal reconstruction. Flavour tagging is not used. Thus, this algorithm can be commissioned early on in the experiment and the sensitivity to systematic biases is minimised. It moreover aims to maintain a very high signal efficiency in a wide range of \(m_{t\bar{t}}\).

The selection of lepton + jets decay of \(t\bar{t}\) events is as follows. The online selection is based on the single-lepton trigger streams. Events are required to have at least one isolated high-\(p_{T}\) lepton and at least three high-\(p_{T}\) jets within \(|\eta|<2.5\). If an electron (muon) is selected, an electron (muon) trigger is required. The lepton isolation criteria requires that the transverse energy in a cone of \(\Delta R<0.2\) around the lepton divided by the lepton \(p_{T}\) is less than 0.1. Jets are reconstructed with the standard ATLAS cone algorithm on calorimeter towers with \(\Delta R=0.4\). Only jets with \(E_{T}>40\) GeV are retained. The neutrino is reconstructed using a fit which includes the lepton momentum, the transverse missing energy and the W boson mass constraint. If more than one solution exists, the one with smaller neutrino \(p_{z}\) is chosen. Additionally, to reduce QCD background \(E_{T}^{miss}>60\) GeV is required if the W boson transverse mass is smaller than 40 GeV. These last two cuts lead to a reduction of QCD background by about 85 % and a moderate loss for other sources of about 15 %.

The number of reconstructed jets in the event and the invariant mass of the calorimeter clusters of the leading jet in the event are used to separate the events into subsamples in the following way:

* events containing four jets are assumed to be fully resolved events. The four jets, the lepton and reconstructed neutrino are used to compute the \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass.
* events containing more than four jets are assumed to be fully resolved events with additional jets from gluon radiation. The four jets with highest transverse momenta, the lepton and reconstructed neutrino are used to compute the \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass.
* events containing three jets are assumed to have merged jets. These events are split into two subsamples according to the highest jet mass found in the event. The first subsample consists of three jet events with the highest jet mass below 65 GeV. Three jet events with the highest jet mass above 65 GeV form the second subsample. The three jets, the lepton and reconstructed neutrino are used to compute the \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass.

No attempt is made to fully reconstruct the top and anti-top quarks. By creating subsamples of different jet multiplicity and jet masses their different sensitivities for the mass range from 500 GeV to 2 TeV are used in an optimal way. The contribution of the dominant background sources varies for the different subsamples. In the 3-jet bin the main source of background are W + jets events, in the 4 or higher jet bins SM \(t\bar{t}\) events are the dominant contribution. The number of reconstructed jets and the jet invariant mass distributions are shown in figure 2.

Figure 2: The distributions of the number of reconstructed jets after pre-selection (a) and the highest jet invariant mass in the 3-jet bin (b) for a 1 TeV \(Z^{\prime}\) boson and the most important background processes.

The reconstruction efficiency is slightly different for electron and muon channels. Therefore, the single subclasses are separated additionally in the electron and muon channels. The reconstructed mass spectra corresponding to 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV are shown in figure 3. The number of expected events, contributions of different background sources and the shapes of distributions vary from channel to channel.

### Full reconstruction

The full reconstruction algorithm has its origins in earlier studies reported in reference [22]. As its name indicates it performs a full reconstruction of the top and anti-top quark. Observables like the mass of the reconstructed top quark candidates, in combination with b-tagging, allow for a tight control of the reducible backgrounds. Recent modification of the algorithm have greatly improved its performance for large \(t\bar{t}\) mass.

Reconstructed objects are defined in the same way as for the minimal approach, but the selection cuts are lower: events must have an isolated lepton with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV, jets with \(E_{T}>20\) GeV and missing

Figure 3: The \(t\bar{t}\) mass spectrum for all relevant background processes reconstructed with the minimal reconstruction approach discussed in the text. The four spectra correspond to four different topologies: (a) 3-jet events with \(m_{j}<65\) GeV, (b) 3-jet events with \(m_{j}>65\) GeV and (c) 4-jet events and (d) 5-jet events. The last bin in the histogram collects the overflow.

transverse energy greater than 20 GeV. To cope with different \(t\bar{t}\) topologies events are only classified according to the invariant mass of the jets:

* if none of the jets has an invariant mass greater than 65 GeV a jet multiplicity of at least four is required, of which two must be b-tagged. The pairing of jets to reconstruct the hadronic top proceeds as described in reference [22]. The hadronic W boson candidate is reconstructed by selecting the jet pair with the smallest \(\Delta R\) distance among the jets not selected by b-tagging. The hadronic top quark candidate is reconstructed by adding the closest jet (in \(\Delta R\)) to the hadronic W boson.
* if the jet with largest invariant mass has a mass in the range [65, 130] GeV the event is assumed to be partially merged. At least three jets are required, one of which must be b-tagged. The hadronic top candidate is constructed by adding one jet to the jet with largest invariant mass.
* if a jet with a mass greater than 130 GeV is found this jet is identified with the hadronic top. One b-tagged jet is required on the leptonic top side.

For the leptonic side the W-mass constraint and the missing transverse energy (identified with the neutrino transverse momentum) are used to determine the longitudinal component of the neutrino momentum. Among the two \(p_{z}^{\nu}\) solutions the one providing the leptonic top mass closest to the mean value (over all events) of the hadronic top mass is chosen.

The resonance mass, initially reconstructed as \(m_{bjjb\nu}\), is corrected for mis-measurements by replacing the measured mass of leptonic and hadronic tops by the world average of the top mass [21, 22] (or the generated mass): \(m_{Z^{\prime}}=m_{bjjb\nu}-m_{bjj}-m_{b\nu}+2m_{t}^{PDG}\). This procedure is expected to yield an improvement of the resonance mass resolution, particularly for small resonance masses, below 1 TeV.

The reconstructed mass distribution is shown in figure 4 for \(Z^{\prime}\) samples with masses of 1 TeV and 2 TeV. The contributions from the three topologies are indicated as well. These results clearly show that for invariant masses of 1 TeV the reconstruction is dominated by the resolved topology (86 %) for this choice of jet algorithm (anti-\(k_{T}\) with \(R=0.4\)). The partially merged topology is chosen for a minor fraction (14 %) of events and the fully merged topology is negligible. For a 2 TeV resonance, on the other hand, the weight of the reconstruction is carried by the partially merged topology (53 %). The

Figure 4: The filled markers correspond to the reconstructed mass distribution for a 1 (a) and 2 TeV resonance (b). The contributions due to the three topologies are indicated: the dotted histogram corresponds to the fully resolved topology (\(m_{j}<65\) GeV), the dashed histogram to the transition topology (partial merge, \(65<m_{j}<130\) GeV) and the continuous line to mono-jets (\(m_{j}>130\) GeV).

resolved approach (31 %) is mostly invoked for events that populate the low-mass tail, while events with a mono-jet topology (16 %) are mostly found in the core of the mass peak.

### Mono-jet approach

The mono-jet approach is intended to reconstruct and identify highly boosted top quarks. The underlying assumption is that a large fraction of events correspond to the mono-jet topology, where individual decay products of the top and anti-top quark cannot be resolved individually. Instead these algorithms attempt to reconstruct the full top quark decay as a single jet. To this end a large jet size (anti-\(k_{T}\) on topological clusters with \(R=1.0\)) is chosen. The combinatorics problem of the resolved approach is then entirely avoided. The main challenge is to distinguish the top mono-jet signal from Standard Model backgrounds like QCD di-jet production and W+jets. Methods must be developed to identify or tag top mono-jets. The most important signatures are the jet substructure present in the hadronically decaying top mono-jet and the lepton embedded in a leptonic top jet. In this section, a range of observables are discussed and a baseline selection is defined.

The power of a large number of jet substructure observables has been investigated. In figure 5 the signal (red continuous line) and background (blue dashed line) distributions are compared for a number of them. The signal sample, corresponding to the continuous red line, consists of jets in the \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) samples. The 1 and 2 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) samples are merged to achieve sufficient statistics for all topologies. Jets with a transverse momentum smaller than 200 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) are excluded, as well as jets where the top decay products (three partons for hadronic W-decays, a parton and a lepton for leptonic W-decays) are not matched to the reconstructed jet. For the hadronic top jets, a jet mass greater than 100 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) is required. The background sample, corresponding to the dashed blue line, is made up of jets in the (PYTHIA) QCD di-jet samples satisfying the same \(p_{T}\) and \(m_{j}\) requirements.

The most straightforward observable is the jet invariant mass. If the top decay is fully contained in the mono-jet, the jet invariant mass indeed peaks around the top mass, as shown in figure 5(a). Jets originating in a single light quark or gluon typically have much smaller invariant mass [56].

The substructure of a hadronic top mono-jet can be further revealed by running a jet algorithm on the jet constituents (typically calorimeter clusters). The splitting scales returned by the algorithm represent the scale at which the mono-jet would be split into two, three or even four objects. After early studies [28] applying the Y-splitter tool [27], the current top mono-jet algorithm [30] uses FASTJET [57] to determine the \(k_{T}\) splitting scale \(d_{12}\) of figure 5(c). This observable indicates the scale where the jet splits in two. The 2-3 and 3-4 splitting scales ( \(d_{23}\) and \(d_{34}\) ) can also be used to select the top mono-jet signal. Finally, \(Q_{W}\) is defined as the invariant mass of the sub-jet pair with lowest mass, when the jet is forced to split into three sub-jets (according to the \(k_{T}\) clustering). The distributions of jet mass, \(Q_{W}\) and \(d_{12}\) for boosted hadronic top decays are compared to those of a QCD background sample in figure 5.

Each of these observables provides a certain power to distinguish top mono-jets from jets originating in a single light quark. Most of these measures are strongly correlated among each other and with the jet transverse momentum. The correlation matrix of all observables for the boosted top and QCD samples reveals linear correlation factors greater than 50 % between the jet mass (and \(Q_{W}\) ) and the splitting scales \(d_{ij}\). To reduce this correlation, the splitting scales can be converted into the energy sharing observables proposed by reference [24] according to \(z_{ij}=d_{ij}/(d_{ij}+m_{j}^{2})\), where \(m_{j}\) is the invariant mass of the jet. The correlation factors between the \(z_{ij}\) and the jet mass and \(Q_{W}\) are indeed much reduced, yielding values in the range from 6 % to 40 %.

The sub-jets provide a quite accurate measure of the parton direction and energy. Typically, the sub-jet is well within \(\Delta R<0.1\) of the nearest parton, while the parton transverse momentum is measured with approximately 10 % accuracy.

The leptonically decaying top quark yields a b-jet and a lepton, while the neutrino escapes detection and contributes to the missing transverse energy of the event. For events containing tops at rest, requiringthe lepton to be isolated is an extremely powerful tool to reduce fully hadronic backgrounds such as Standard Model di-jet production. The isolation requirement typically consists of a cut on the energy in a cone around the lepton of size \(\Delta R\). In boosted topologies, however, the distance between the lepton and the b quark becomes very small. Often the lepton is reconstructed as part of the jet, and the traditional isolation criterion cannot be applied efficiently. Thus, leptons from the decay of B- and D-hadrons in bottom and charm jets form a potentially dangerous background.

Several observables have been developed that allow leptonic top quark decays to be distinguished from b- and c-jets. The visible mass \(Q_{vis}\) is defined as the invariant mass of the (leptonic top) jet. This is analogous to \(m_{j}\) in the hadronic case, with the difference that the escaping neutrino can carry away a large fraction of the top mass. A number of observables combining the lepton and jet momenta have been proposed. In the following, the lepton candidate momentum is subtracted from the jet momentum, so that \(p_{j}\) is a measure of the b-jet momentum. This is particularly important for electrons. A number of observables from reference [24] have been investigated. The selection is based on the fraction of the energy and jet mass carried by the jet and by the embedded lepton, and on the distance between the

Figure 5: Distribution for signal jets (red, continuous line) and (PYTHIA) QCD di-jet background (blue, dashed line) for several observables used to select hadronic (top row) and leptonic (bottom row) top mono-jets: jet mass (a), the invariant mass \(Q_{W}\) of the sub-jet pair with the lowest mass (b), the scale \(d_{12}\) at which the \(k_{T}\) algorithm splits the jet in two sub-jets (c), fraction of jet mass carried by the lepton (d), approximate \(k_{T}\) distance between lepton and jet (e) and tracker-based mini-isolation (f). Hadronic top jets are required to have \(p_{T}>200\) and a jet mass greater than \(100\). For leptonic top mono-jets the lepton is required to be within \(\Delta R<1\) of the jet axis. For jets with electrons (muons) the \(p_{T}\) cut is lowered to \(150\).

lepton and the jet axis \(\Delta R_{jj}\) :

\[z_{l}=\frac{E_{l}}{E_{l}+E_{j}},\quad x_{l}=\frac{2p_{l}\cdot p_{j}}{(p_{l}+p_{j}) ^{2}},\quad y_{l}=p_{l\perp j}\times\Delta R_{lj}\]

where \(E_{j}\) and \(E_{l}\) are the jet and lepton energies, \(p_{j}\) and \(p_{l}\) their momenta, and \(p_{l\perp j}\) the lepton momentum with respect to the candidate b-jet. The variable \(y_{l}\) yields a measure similar to (the square root of) the \(k_{T}\) distance used by the \(k_{T}\) clustering algorithm [30]. The signal and background distributions for \(x_{l}\) and \(y_{l}\) are shown in figure 5.

Several isolation procedures based on the energy deposited in a cone around the lepton direction have been studied. The relative isolation \(I^{rel}\) measures the energy deposited in a \(\Delta R<0.2\) cone around the lepton (excluding the lepton itself) divided by the lepton energy. For mini-isolation [58], the size of the cone depends on the lepton momentum \(\Delta R<15\) GeV \(/p_{T}^{l}\). Two mini-isolation observables are constructed, \(I^{mini}_{calo}\), that sums the energy of calorimeter clusters, and \(I^{mini}_{trk}\), that determines the energy carried by charged particle tracks in the cone. As shown in figure 5, the latter turns out to be a very powerful discriminant.

A baseline selection for the top mono-jet approach is chosen to achieve optimal performance for a resonance mass of 1 TeV. It consists of the cuts in table 2. A tighter selection that yields better control of the background for larger resonance mass is listed in table 2 as well.

\begin{table}

Figure 6: The \(t\bar{t}\) reconstruction efficiency and (PYTHIA) QCD di-jet background rejection ( defined as \(R=1-\epsilon\) ) versus jet \(p_{T}\) for the leptonic (a) and hadronic top decay (b).

The signal and background efficiencies of both selections are compared in figure 6. The selection on the leptonic leg, shown in figure 6(a), results in a strong reduction of the QCD di-jet background: for jet \(p_{T}\) between 500 and 1 TeV, the reduction factor is 25 (36) using the baseline (tight) selection. These results show that the selection is quite robust: a strong additional rejection can be achieved at a relatively small cost in signal efficiency. Through cuts on several observables, the leptonic selection also contributes significantly to the reduction of the W+jets background.

The hadronic leg, shown in figure 6(b), is clearly a much less powerful handle on the QCD background than the selection based on the leptonic top decay. To keep a good signal efficiency, both selections place relatively mild cuts on the jet substructure observables, settling for a QCD rejection factor of 3. It should be noted, however, that these observables are quite important to reduce the contribution of background processes involving leptonic W-decay. The combination of leptonic and hadronic top-tagging renders the contribution of reducible backgrounds negligible compared to the irreducible Standard Model \(t\bar{t}\) production. In the remainder of this note, the baseline selection is used.

## 5 Performance

In this section, the performance of the different reconstruction algorithms is discussed. The focus of this comparison is on two aspects: the signal reconstruction efficiency versus background rejection, and the resolution with which the resonance mass can be determined. The former is crucial for early resonance searches, where very few signal events are expected. For narrow resonances, the width of the reconstructed peak, and thus the integrated \(t\bar{t}\) continuum background, depends strongly on the latter.

### Trigger & Pre-selection

The response of the Level-1 and High-Level Trigger (HLT) are emulated as part of the ATLAS full simulation chain, allowing the trigger efficiency to be studied on simulated events. The online selection of lepton \(+\) jets \(t\bar{t}\) events relies primarily on the single-electron and single-muon triggers. The lepton quality criteria and the \(p_{T}\) threshold are expected to vary as the instantaneous luminosity of the LHC ramps up. Several trigger streams have been defined for luminosities of \(10^{31}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) to \(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The efficiencies with which the single lepton streams of the trigger system select the 1 TeV \(Z^{\prime}\) signal and background events are given in table 3, along with the efficiency of the common pre-selection of section 4.1, and the trigger efficiency for events that satisfy the pre-selection requirements.

The trigger efficiencies after pre-selection are found to be close to 100 % for all samples where the electron stems from W-decay. For muons, on the other hand, the trigger shows a significant inefficiency of approximately 20 % in all samples. This inefficiency is due to the L1 selection and is concentrated in several areas in the \(\eta-\phi\) acceptance corresponding to well-known areas of the ATLAS detector. The jet trigger can be used to recover most of the trigger inefficiency, but in the remainder of this note only the lepton triggers are used. The trigger efficiency is found to be independent of the \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass (within the uncertainty of a few %) in the studied range from 500 to 2.5 TeV [59].

After the pre-selection the efficiency is over 55 % for a 1 to 2 TeV \(Z^{\prime}\). The selection efficiency of SM \(t\bar{t}\) events with lepton \(+\) jets final state is of the order of 50 %. Approximately 30 % of W \(+\) jets events with leptonic W decay pass the pre-selection. QCD di-jet production is reduced by well over a factor \(10^{3}\), but reducible background processes still clearly dominate over Standard Model \(t\bar{t}\) production.

### Mass resolution

The expected reconstructed mass distribution for a narrow, 1 TeV \(Z^{\prime}\) boson is presented in figure 7 for the transition region approaches (minimal and full reconstruction) and for the mono-jet approach.

The mean value and the RMS of the reconstructed distributions are presented in table 4. The peak mass typically underestimates the resonance mass by up to 15 %. For the resonance masses considered here (\(m_{Z^{\prime}}=1\), 2 TeV), the RMS of the distribution ranges from approximately 20 % of the resonance mass for the transition region approaches to 14 % for the mono-jet approach. In the full reconstruction and the mono-jet approach, the core of the residual distribution (generated mass - reconstructed mass) is significantly narrower: a Gaussian fit of the residual distribution in a limited interval centred on the peak yields \(\sigma_{core}=9\)-10 % at 1 TeV. Significant low-mass tails are present, especially for full reconstruction, and have a strong effect on the RMS of the distribution.

As discussed in [60] the low-mass tail can be related to gluons radiated off the top quarks. Frequently, these gluons can carry a significant fraction of the energy of the \(t\bar{t}\) pair. In this case, the underestimate of the mass is accompanied by a non-zero transverse momentum of the \(t\bar{t}\) system. In the mono-jet approach, the peak and the width of the residual distribution are, however, found to be essentially independent of \(p_{T}^{t\bar{t}}\). Indeed, this might have been expected: the gluons are typically radiated in the direction of the top quarks and are then contained in the fat jet. For the full reconstruction approach, on the other hand, the

The signal efficiency is listed for the single lepton trigger streams envisaged for early data (the efficiency for events that pass all pre-selection cuts is indicated in parentheses), for the off-line reconstruction and selection of the leptons and for the total pre-selection (events satisfying the lepton and \(E_{T}^{miss}>25\) GeV requirements).

peak is found to become significantly sharper if events are selected where the transverse momentum of the \(t\bar{t}\) system is small, thus reducing both the RMS and \(\sigma_{core}\) by approximately 10 %.

### Reconstruction and selection efficiency

The number of signal and background events expected in 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) at 10 TeV is summarised in table 5. The number of events is given in a mass window around the reconstructed signal peak. The width of the window differs for the various analyses and corresponds to twice the RMS of the reconstructed signal mass distribution (see table 4).

The minimal reconstruction approach described in section 4.2 was designed for high efficiency. The simple selection and reconstruction procedure can be commissioned early in the experiment. The overall signal efficiency is about 28 % after the final selection; about 18 % of signal events are reconstructed in the \(\pm\) 1 RMS around the mass peak. The sample is sufficiently signal-enriched that a good sensitivity to a resonant signal is obtained. Importantly, the reconstruction efficiency is maintained well into the multi-TeV regime. The efficiency is nearly constant over the broad mass range from 1 to 2 TeV.

The full reconstruction approach takes advantage of more information in the event and employs b-tagging. The more sophisticated selection leads to a penalty in signal efficiency, but offers improved control over reducible Standard Model processes (di-jets, W+jets) whose contributions become negligible with respect to SM \(t\bar{t}\) pair production. The adaptation of the algorithm to extend into the transition region is clearly quite successful. A reconstruction efficiency of 5 % is obtained at 1 TeV, compared to 2 % in [22]. More importantly, this higher efficiency is maintained for larger masses.

Finally, the wide range of top-tagging observables used by the mono-jet approach is found to provide good control over the reducible backgrounds. The baseline selection for which results are presented in table 5 is sufficient to obtain a mass spectrum dominated by the \(t\bar{t}\) signal. In the high-mass regime the efficiency of the mono-jet approach is approximately 15 % including trigger and pre-selection efficiency. As discussed in section 4.4, a tighter selection can be designed that further reduces the backgrounds at a relatively small cost in signal efficiency. An important result is the efficiency of nearly 10 % for \(m_{t\bar{t}}=1\) TeV. Thus, this study shows that the application of the mono-jet approach can be extended to masses well below the interval explored in [28] and [30].

Figure 7: The reconstructed \(t\bar{t}\) mass distribution, normalised to unit area, combining the electron and muon signal, for a narrow Z’ (m = 1 TeV \(\Gamma/m=3.3\) %). The three histograms correspond to different approaches for reconstruction of the \(Z^{\prime}\) candidate: (a) minimal reconstruction, 3-jet, high-mass category; (b) full reconstruction; and (c) mono-jet approach. In (b) an additional jet is added if it is found around the direction of one of the reconstructed tops.

With respect to previous ATLAS studies, where the efficiency was found to degrade very rapidly with increasing mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system [22], these results shed a much more optimistic light on the possibility of reconstructing resonances in the large \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) regime.

## 6 Sensitivity

In the previous section, the reconstruction of the \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass spectrum into the \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) regime was discussed. In this section, the reconstructed mass spectrum is presented, and the sensitivity for a resonant signal is discussed.

### Reconstructed mass spectrum

The reconstructed \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass spectrum, corresponding to an early physics run in the ATLAS experiment, is shown in figure 8. The corresponding spectra from the minimal approach are shown in figure 3. Only Standard Model processes are considered. In the early physics scenario used for this Monte Carlo production, 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data at a centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV were envisaged. As discussed in the previous section, SM \(t\bar{t}\) is the dominant background. Other backgrounds are well under control and can be reduced further at an affordable cost in signal efficiency.

Perhaps the most significant difference between the different approaches is found in the low-mass region. The transition region approaches can reliably reconstruct the distribution down to the threshold ( \(m_{t\bar{t}}=2m_{t}\) ). As shown in figure 8(a), the spectrum is described by an exponential in a broad \(m_{t\bar{t}}\) range from 400 GeV to 3 TeV. For the mono-jet approach, the low-mass region is depleted, as the topology assumed in this approach is formed only rarely. For this reason, the background exponential starts at the higher mass of 800 GeV. The delayed turn-on is accentuated by the \(E_{T}\) cut on the leading jet. Loosening this cut, however, does not restore the region to an exponential shape.

Reducible backgrounds include W+jets, Z+jets, single top and QCD di-jet production. For the full reconstruction approach, including b-tagging, the contribution from \(Wb\bar{b}\) is taken into account. For the mono-jet approach, single top and Z+jets were ignored after earlier studies established that their contribution is negligible.

### Sensitivity projection

To determine the sensitivity of the early stages of the ATLAS experiment to \(t\bar{t}\) resonances, a statistical analysis is performed on the distributions of figures 8 and 3. The results are presented in this section. The 95 % confidence level signal cross-section limit is extracted using two different statistical tools:

1. A Bayesian analysis using a tool [61] implemented for the DO experiment is used. For each bin of the \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass distribution, a likelihood function is defined. To retrieve a likelihood for the whole distribution, the likelihoods of the single bins are multiplied. To combine the electron and muon and the several jet multiplicity channels, again the product of the likelihoods of the individual channels is taken. The posterior probability density is calculated using Bayes' theorem, with a flat prior for the positive cross-sections and a prior equal to zero for the negative cross-sections. The cross-section limit of a pseudo-experiment is identified with the 95 % point of the posterior density. The upper limit on the signal cross-section is determined as the median value in 10000 pseudo-experiments. The 16 % and 84 % quantiles are also determined.
2. A Feldman-Cousins [62] limit is determined using an implementation described in detail in [59]. In this approach the mass spectrum for electron and muon channels are fit simultaneously with an exponential \(C_{l}\exp{[-\lambda_{t}m_{\bar{t}}]}\). Thus, the derived limits take into account the uncertainty on the background shape. The signal is represented by a Monte Carlo template. The uncertainty in the signal template is encoded in the systematic error.

Both methods were cross-checked and found to agree with the \(CL_{s}\) method of [63]. The results are shown in figure 9. Those of selected mass points are listed in table 6. For the full reconstruction and mono-jet approaches, both statistical methods have been applied, and a direct comparison is possible. The agreement between the results of the Bayesian and Feldman-Cousins limit calculation is satisfactory.

To estimate the effect of systematic biases and uncertainties on the data, the analysis is repeated after applying relevant effects to the Monte Carlo events. The estimates for the size of systematic detector effects follow the prescriptions in reference [22]. In the following, an uncertainty on the jet energy

scale (JES) of 10 % is considered. The jet energy resolution (JER) is moreover artificially degraded by smearing the jet \(E_{T}\) with an additional 25 % \(/\sqrt{E~{}[\mathrm{GeV}]}\oplus\) 5 %. The combined effect of these systematic uncertainties is a significant degradation of the sensitivity, as indicated by the open markers in figures 9(a) to 9(d). The grey band in the figure indicates the \(\pm\) 1 standard deviation interval determined from the cross-section distribution of the pseudo-experiments without signal.

Several other sources of systematic uncertainties are considered. A 10 % error on the luminosity is found to have a considerable effect when the tool based on the Bayesian prescription is used. The limit for the lowest mass points increases strongly: up to 30 % for \(m_{t\bar{t}}=700\) GeV, while the effect at higher mass is limited to a few %. Good control of the background normalization using data-driven methods is therefore mandatory in this case. The approach based on the Feldman-Cousins prescription, on the other hand, does not rely on the background normalization. The effect of the luminosity error on its results is found to be negligible. The more detailed study in [64] corroborates that jet energy scale and resolution and the luminosity error are the most important sources of uncertainty on the normalization of the SM \(t\bar{t}\) background. The systematics related to initial and final state radiation were moreover studied on the \(Z^{\prime}\) signal samples and found to be negligible.

Figure 9: The ATLAS sensitivity with 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data at a centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV for a narrow resonance obtained with (a) minimal reconstruction, (b) full reconstruction, and (c) mono-jet reconstruction. The sensitivity of the mono-jet approach to a broad resonance is shown in (d). The open markers correspond to the result including systematic effects. The grey band indicates the \(\pm\) 1 standard deviation interval, determined from the cross-section limit distribution of the pseudo-experiments without signal.

The leptophobic \(Z^{\prime}\) of the topcolor model has a production rate, indicated in figure 9, that is comparable to the limits derived here. Therefore, an early LHC run is expected to constrain this model in a mass range that is not covered by previous experiments. The remaining \(Z^{\prime}\) and graviton models have \(\sigma\times BR\) that are significantly smaller, and a greater integrated luminosity is required to constrain such models in the mass range considered here.

The results in figures 9(a) to 9(c) are derived using a signal template based on a spin-1 resonance with a negligible width (\(\Gamma/m=3.3\) %) and are valid only for resonances whose natural width does not contribute significantly to the reconstructed mass distribution of the signal.

The effect of the spin is evaluated by repeating the mono-jet reconstruction on a KK graviton (\(G_{KK}\)) sample with \(k/M_{Pl}=0.1\) and \(\Gamma/m=1.4\) %. Feldman-Cousins limits are obtained for this spin-2 particle of 1.5 pb (statistics only) and 2.9 pb (including systematics). These limits are significantly tighter than for the spin-1 \(Z^{\prime}\) boson, reflecting the differences in acceptance and efficiency of the two benchmark samples.

BSM scenarios with strongly coupled resonances can yield a much larger production rate and branching fraction into \(t\bar{t}\), but are typically much broader than the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson. To estimate the sensitivity to resonances with a non-negligible width, the statistical analysis was repeated using a signal template based on the KK gluon benchmark samples. As expected, the 95 % C.L. limits thus obtained, valid for \(\Gamma/m=15.3\) %, are weaker than those for a narrow resonance. In figure 9(d), the limits are represented graphically, together with the expected cross-section for the KK gluon in the basic RS setup.

## 7 Conclusions & discussion

Three complementary algorithms for the reconstruction of the \(t\bar{t}\) invariant mass spectrum have been developed, described and compared in this note. The results obtained with two adaptations of classical top reconstruction algorithms demonstrate that their range of applicability can be extended well into the TeV regime.

Table 6: The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment after an early LHC run (200 pb\({}^{-1}\) at a centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV) for \(t\bar{t}\) resonances. The numbers indicate the 95 % C.L. exclusion limits, in pb, on the product of production and decay rate into \(t\bar{t}\) events in the absence of signal. Two statistical tools, based on Bayesian and Feldman-Cousins (FC) prescriptions, are used to determine the limits. Results for three approaches to the reconstruction are presented, with and without the systematic effects on the jet energy scale and resolution described in the text. The \(Z^{\prime}\) limits are valid for narrow (\(\Gamma/m<<7\) %) spin-1 resonances, the KK graviton (\(G_{KK}\)) limits for a narrow spin-2 state, and the KK gluon (\(g_{KK}\)) limits for a broad resonance (\(\Gamma/m=15.3\) %).

approximately 18 % for the 1-2 TeV mass range. The full reconstruction method provides additional rejection of the reducible backgrounds at a signal efficiency of approximately 5 % for \(m=1\)-2 TeV. The mono-jet approach, where boosted top decays are reconstructed as a single jet, was found to provide reliable reconstruction down to \(m_{t\bar{t}}=700\) GeV, while a signal efficiency of over 9 % (15 %) is obtained at 1 TeV (2 TeV). Thus, the very challenging mass region where different topologies coexist is covered.

The improved performance of the reconstruction is clearly reflected in the sensitivity of early searches. If no deviation from the Standard Model is observed, a 95 % C.L. limit of \(\sigma\times BR(X\to t\bar{t})=3\) pb is expected for a resonance mass of 1 TeV after 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) at 10 TeV. A consistent statistical treatment for resonances with a different spin or a non-negligible width has furthermore been exercised. For \(\Gamma/m=15.3\) %, the limit is found to be slightly weaker than for a narrow resonance of the same mass. The sensitivity in the 700 GeV - 1.5 TeV mass regime is comparable to the rates predicted in plausible BSM scenarios.

The earliest LHC data is being collected at a centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The production rates of objects with a mass of 1 TeV through \(q\bar{q}\) and \(gg\)-initiated processes are reduced by factors 2.7 and 4, respectively [65, 66]. The cross-section of the benchmark signals considered here is thus affected less than the (predominantly gluon-initiated) background. To compensate for the loss in parton-luminosity due to the reduced centre-or-mass energy, a larger data sample has to be collected. In the run scenario where 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) is accumulated at 7 TeV, the loss in cross-section is compensated for by the gain in integrated luminosity 4). As a result, early searches at 7 TeV are still expected to extend the existing experimental constraints well into the TeV regime.

Footnote 4: The selection efficiency has been cross-checked for some selected 7 TeV Monte Carlo samples and is found to be within 5 % of the values found for this study.

We are greatly indebted to all CERN's departments and to the LHC project for their immense efforts not only in building the LHC, but also for their direct contributions to the construction and installation of the ATLAS detector and its infrastructure. We acknowledge equally warmly all our technical colleagues in the collaborating Institutions without whom the ATLAS detector could not have been built. Furthermore we are grateful to all the funding agencies which supported generously the construction and the commissioning of the ATLAS detector and also provided the computing infrastructure. The ATLAS detector design and construction has taken about fifteen years, and our thoughts are with all our colleagues who sadly could not see its final realisation.
