###### Abstract

The muons produced at LHC will pass through a large amount of matter before they enter the muon chambers. On their way through the ATLAS inner detector, calorimeter and support structures, they can produce electromagnetic showers. In order to study the influence of the shower production on the chamber performance, three runs were taken in August 1998; one run with no absorber in front of the MDT chamber BOS; one with an iron absorber of 5 cm thickness 27 cm in front of BOS; and one with the iron absorber 47 cm distance from the chamber. A silicon telescope in front of BOS was used to determine a reference muon track. The presence of the iron absorber reduces the tracking efficiency by 1% at a muon energy of 180 GeV. The analysis of the data verifies the reliability of a GEANT Monte-Carlo simulation at the muon energy of 180 GeV. The comparison of Monte-Carlo and data is difficult due to the lack of precise knowledge of the impurities of the H8 muon beam. The Monte-Carlo simulation, however, provides reliable upper limits for the decrease of the tracking efficiency at higher energies: At 1 TeV muon energy, the tracking efficiency in a chamber is reduced by 15% in the worst case, i.e. for iron absorbers of more than 20 cm thickness.

## 1 Introduction

When highly energetic muons pass through matter, their energy loss is almost entirely due to radiation processes. At a muon energy of about 180 GeV therelevant processes are pair production, bremsstrahlung, and ionization [1]. These processes add electrons and photons to the muon beam and - since they give additional hits in the muon chamber - may spoil the reconstruction efficiency of the muon chamber behind the matter. In order to get an insight into the behaviour of MDT chambers in the presence of the ATLAS calorimeter and support structures, three runs were taken at the CERN H8 muon beam in August 1998: one run with no absorber in front of BOS; and two runs with a 5 cm thick iron absorber in front of BOS, once 27 cm distance from the chamber, once 47 cm distance. During these runs a silicon telescope (STEL)[2] consisting of four planes of silicon strip detectors was installed in front of the chamber to determin a reference muon track with high precision.

## 2 Event Selection

Figure 1 shows a schematic of the experimental configuration where one can see the positions of the absorber in the silicon telescope. Each of the three runs contains 30000 events. About 10000 events pass all selection criteria which are described below. The shower particles produced in the iron absorber can cause

Figure 1: The experimental configuration at the test-beam runs.

extra hits in the telescope planes behind it. In order not to reject such events we apply the following selection criteria:

1. We require \(-\) avoiding thus a bias \(-\) at least one hit in each STEL plane. This guarantees that a muon was present, on the one hand, on the other hand it is the minimum number of hits needed for tracking because in case of multiple scattering in the iron absorber there are four unknown quantities, namely the slopes and offsets of the incoming and outgoing muon track.
2. We require exactly one hit in the first and in the second STEL plane. With these two hits we can determine a track candidate \(y_{\mu}(z)\). In the notation of figure 1, its slope is \[m_{y}:=\frac{y_{2}-y_{1}}{z_{2}-z_{1}}\text{ with the uncertainty }\delta m_{y}\] and its offset equals \[b_{y}:=y_{1}-m_{y}z_{1}\text{ with the uncertainty }\delta b_{y}.\]
3. We extrapolate the muon track into the fourth telescope plane. The uncertainty \(\delta y_{\mu}\) of the extrapolation \(-\) if there is no absorber in the beam \(-\) is \[\sqrt{(z_{4}\delta m_{y})^{2}+(\delta b_{y})^{2}},\] and with the absorber approximately \[\sqrt{(z_{4}\delta m_{y})^{2}+(\delta b_{y})^{2}+[\theta_{0}\,(z_{4}-z_{a})]^{ 2}},\] where \(\theta_{0}\) denotes the mean scattering angle.
4. We only accept an event, if we find a hit in the interval \[(y_{\mu}(z_{4})-2\delta y_{\mu}(z_{4}),y_{\mu}\,(z_{4})+2\delta y_{\mu}(z_{4})).\]

Our selection does not preferably reject events with a lot of hits in the third STEL plane; the accepted and rejected events have approximately the same multiplicity distribution of hits in the STEL plane behind the absorber.

## 3 Tracking in the Silicon Telescope

The parameters of the track candidate can be refined by a fit. Without the iron absorber in the muon beam, the improved reference track can be obtained by a conventional straight line fit through at least three clusters in the silicon telescope planes. With the iron absorber, multiple scattering in the iron absorber causes a deviation of the outgoing from the incoming muon track. The conventional straight line fit must therefore be replaced by a fit which takes into account multiple scattering. This has been done in the present analysis. Let \(m_{\mathit{in}}\), \(b_{\mathit{in}}\), and \(m_{\mathit{out}}\), \(b_{\mathit{out}}\) be the slope and intercept of the muon track before entering the absorber and after leaving it, respectively. In the fitting procedure, one maximizes the likelihood \(\mathcal{L}\left(m_{\mathit{in}},b_{\mathit{in}};m_{\mathit{out}},b_{\mathit{ out}}\right)\) which is the product of three terms: the probability to measure the two hits at their position in front of the absorber, if the muon track parameters are \(m_{\mathit{in}}\) and \(b_{\mathit{in}}\); the probability that the muon is scattered into the state \(\left(m_{\mathit{out}},b_{\mathit{out}}\right)\); and the probability for the measurement of the hit points behind the absorber.

## 4 Phenomenological Analysis of Extra Hits

In this section we will study the extra hit distribution in the first triple layer of BOS. We will omit the second triple layer because the chamber was unfortunately adjusted such that the muon beam passed through a cross bar between the first and second triple layers.

### Classification of Extra Hits

The shower particles produced by the absorber lead to extra hits in the BOS chamber in addition to the hits produced by the triggering muon. In the analysis, extra hits have been divided into three classes: single hits, second track hits, and cluster hits.

A _single hit_ is a hit which does not lie on the muon track and where there is no hit in the neighbouring tubes. We also consider a hit as a single hit, if the neighbouring hit tube lies on the silicon telescope track (see figure 2).

In addition to the reference track, another track with a confidence level greater than 1% may be found in BOS. Hits that lie on this additional track are collected

Figure 2: A single hit in a triple layer.

in a separate class. We will refer to these hits as _second track hits_.

The remaining extra hits occure in clusters and belong to the third class, _cluster hits_.

The percentage of events containing extra hits of the three different classes have been determined for the three runs. Figure 3 shows the result of the measurement where we considered only extra hits with drift times within the interval \([0,\;500\;\mathrm{ns}]\), which is the drift-time interval for particles in time with the muon. When there is no iron absorber in the muon beam, 33% of the events have extra hits. This number goes up to 38% as soon as the absorber is put into the beam. The total rates for close-absorber and far-absorber data agree within errors as expected, since the number of shower particles produced in the absorber is independent of its relative position to the chamber. In all cases almost all of the extra hits are either single extra hits or belong to a cluster of extra hits. Extra tracks are rare and not discussed any further.

Figure 3: Frequency of events containing extra hits of different kinds: 0 - no extra hits, 1 - only single extra hits, 2 - only track hits, 3 - only clusters of extra hits, 4 - single and track hits, 5 - single and cluster hits, 6 - track and cluster hits, 7 - all three kinds.

### Study of Single Hits

#### 4.2.1 Pure Single Hits

In 11% of the selected events, the extra hits found in BOS are entirely single hits. They will be called _pure single hits_. Most of them are not correlated with the muon trigger as we will see in this section.

Regarding the pure single hits, there is only a difference of (1.0\(\pm\)0.4)% between absorber and no-absorber data. In both cases, they are almost uniformely distributed over the chamber with a small peak close to the muon track (see figure 4).

The spike at about +3 tubes with respect to the muon tube is due to a noisy tube in the first layer. If the pure single hits were not correlated with the trigger, they would look the same for no-absorber and absorber data. Their drift -time spectrum would be flat, for, in case their rate is low, the pure single hits would be uniformely distributed in time. The observed drift-time spectrum is shown in figure 5.

The distribution is quite flat, but has a small excess in the window [0 ns, 500 ns], from which one can conclude that only about 20% are correlated with the muon.

Since the pure single hits are almost not correlated with the trigger, their number per event should be Poisson distributed. The experimental distributions

Figure 4: Spatial distribution of pure single hits.

are indeed approximately reproducible by a Poisson distribution of mean 0.15 per triple layer.

#### 4.2.2 Non-pure Single Hits

Single hits can also occur with clusters of extra hits. Their drift-time spectrum (see figure 6) consists of two parts: a flat background which is not correlated with the muon and, on top of it, a drift-time spectrum characteristic for a tube illuminated by muon-correlated particles; 50% of the hits are correlated with the muon track. We will call single hits which occur with hit clusters non-pure single hits. The spatial distribution of the non-pure single hits is similar to the spatial distribution of the pure single hits. For the first triple layer, the multiplicity of non-pure single hits is also approximately Poisson distributed with mean 0.09.

### Clusters of Hits

Without the iron absorber in front of BOS 16% of the events have cluster hits, rising to 19% for the far iron absorber. This rise should be caused by the iron absorber. Hence the additional hits must be in time with the muon. Figure 7

Figure 5: Spatial distribution of pure single hits.

justifies this conjecture. It also shows that about 80% of the cluster hits are correlated with the muon.

The cluster hits are spread over \(\pm 15\) tubes around the muon track (see figure 8). (The spread is \(\pm 6\) tubes if the absorber is close to BOS.) In other words, the angular spread of the cluster hits with respect to the muon track is about \(60^{o}\). In the relevant drift-time window the absorber causes 0.38 extra hits per triple layer. The cluster-size distribution in a triple layer has its maximum at 3 tubes; its mean is 7-8 tubes.

### Summary of the Phenomenological Analysis

Our phenomenological analysis shows that, without absorber, there is a high rate of extra hits caused by the dirty H8 muon beam. They are spread over the entire chamber and amount to 1.5 extra hits (single hits or cluster hits) per triple layer within the muon time.

The absorber produces extra hits (essentially clusters with and without extra single hits). They are spread over \(\pm 15\) tubes around the muon track. The absorber causes 0.38 extra hits per layer within the muon time.

Monte-Carlo Studies

The higher the muon energy the higher the probability for a shower to be produced. At LHC muons with energies higher than 180 GeV will be observed. It is therefore desirable to study the chamber performance up to the TeV range. Since these muon energies are not available for tests before LHC is running, one has to rely on Monte-Carlo.

We have written a GEANT Monte-Carlo simulation of the test-beam setup. In our simulation, one gets a hit in a tube whenever a charged particle is present in the tube's sensitive gas volume, except at the tube wall where the drop in efficiency is taken into account. The non-gaussian tails in the r-t relation close to the signal wire are simulated [3]. We have chosen the standard ATLAS cuts: electrons and photons are followed to a minimum energy of 100 keV. Lowering the energy cuts for electrons and photons to 10 keV did not change our results.

We compared the Monte-Carlo simulation with the test-beam measurements. In agreement with the test-beam data, in Monte-Carlo the absorber produces mainly single extra hits and clusters of extra hits, extra tracks are very rare. The increase of events with only single extra hits is the same in Monte-Carlo and experimental data. However, the increase of events with only clusters of extra hits is a factor 2-3 greater in Monte-Carlo than in the experimental data.

The main difficulty in quantitatively comparing Monte-Carlo and experimental data is caused by the impurities of the H8 muon beam. The absorber certainly does not only add extra particles to the muon track, it also absorbs impurities in the muon beam. It is not clear how this quantitatively affects the observed extra hit distribution. We therefore considered two extreme cases in our analysis. We either assumed that the absorber did not absorb any beam impurities, or that it absorbed all of them.

We start with the first assumption. We compared the extra hit distribution in the first triple layer in Monte-Carlo with data for the far absorber. We obtained this experimental extra hit distribution by subtracting the extra hit distribution for no-absorber data from the distribution with the far absorber. Figure 9 shows the experimental and the simulated distribution. They agree far from the track. They differ by a factor 2 within \(\pm 5\) tubes around the muon track. Adopting the second assumption, we plot the Monte-Carlo distribution onto the extra hit distribution of the far absorber run (see figure 10) - this time the no-absorber distribution is _not_ subtracted. To take into account the non-correlated part of the extra hit distribution we multiplied the experimental bin entries by 0.8. Now Monte-Carlo and experimental data agree close to the muon track, but differ far from it, as expected since there the absorber can't absorb impurities and the Monte-Carlo does not contain beam impurities. We therefore believe that the second explanation is more realistic than the first one. Nevertheless, the absorber covers only \(\pm 2\) tubes, not \(\pm 5\) (the region where Monte-Carlo and experimental data match); that's why we doubt that the discrepancy is entirely due to the absorption of the beam impurities by the absorber. A way out of the remaining discrepancy might be that the shower particles produced by the aborber are absorbed in the STEL support behind it.

Obviously, further experimental tests are necessary to better judge the quality of the Monte-Carlo simulation. At the moment, to match Monte-Carlo and data, we need the rather extreme assumption that the absorber removes the incoming dirt; otherwise too many secondaries from the absorber are predicted. As the secondaries may spoil the tracking efficiency, the use of the Monte-Carlo leads to lower limits of it.

## 6 Influence of the Absorber on the Tracking Efficiency

### Test-Beam Results

An absolute tracking efficiency can be defined with the help of the silicon telescope as follows: Let \(m_{STEL}\) be the slope of the STEL reference track and let \(m_{\,BOS}\) be the slope of the reconstructed BOS track; we accept tracks with 4, 5, and 6 hits in BOS (not only golden tracks!). Histogramming \(m_{\,STEL}-m_{\,BOS}\) yields a gaussian of mean 0 and standard deviation \(\sigma\). Let us characterize the \(3\sigma\) tracking efficiency as

\[\epsilon_{3\sigma}:=\frac{\#\ events\ with\ |m_{\,STEL}-m_{\,BOS}-\mu\|<3 \sigma}{\#\ select\,ed\ events}.\]

The analysis of the data shows that the \(3\sigma\) tracking efficiency is reduced by 1% for the absorber data compared to the no-absorber data.

Figure 10: Distribution of additional extra clusters of hits caused by the absorber. The Monte-Carlo distribution is plotted onto the extra hit distribution of the far absorber run. The beam hits the tube 0. The experimental distribution is corrected for non-correlated background.

### Monte-Carlo Results for Tracking in a BOS Chamber

The Monte-Carlo simulation enables us to determine the tracking efficiency for higher muon energies and different absorber thicknesses. In the Monte-Carlo, the beam was perpendicular to BOS and centred between the 32nd and 33rd tube of the first layer; a flat horizontal and vertical beam distribution of \(\pm\)3cm was simulated. This causes a relatively low efficiency even without the absorber. In the Monte-Carlo we did not shoot the muon into the cross bar; the main effect of the cross bar is that it causes a flat background in the \(m_{STEL}-m_{BOS}\) distribution, which is the same in Monte-Carlo and experimental data.

Table 1 contains the results of the Monte-Carlo studies. The tracking efficiency is independent of the muon energy if there is no absorber in the beam. At 1 TeV muon energy, however, it is reduced by 10% for a 10 cm thick iron absorber. The effect of the absorber saturates after 20 cm thickness. This study was done without considering the magnetic field which is present in ATLAS and can effect the tracking efficiency.

## 7 Outlook

The currently available data don't allow to profoundly judge whether the GEANT Monte-Carlo simulation can reproduce the test-beam measurement. To judge this, one has to take new data. The uncertainties in the present analysis could be removed, if, in future runs, the absorber is put behind the telescope at different positions. Different absorber thicknesses would help as well. The analysis of the current runs describes the situation at a muon energy of 180 GeV. In order to simulate the shower production in the absorber and its influence on the tracking efficiency more reliably, it would also be important to repeat the test-beam measurements at different muon energies up to 300 GeV (the maximum H8 energy) with an improved set-up which allows an interpretation of the data without the detailed knowledge of the beam halo.
