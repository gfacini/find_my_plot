###### Abstract

This note presents the acceptable values of resistances on kapton electrodes. Using detector considerations and technology aspects, we define for the different types of resistances on the electrodes the range of the acceptable values.

## 1 The method

From geometrical considerations and the hypothesis that the _resistivity per square, R/\(\Box\)_, of the ink is 1 \(M\Omega/\Box\) at room temperature, the _nominal_ values \(R_{nom}\) of the resistance of the individual resistors for each electrode type have been calculated.

Then, to accept an electrode, it was required that for 90% of the resistors the measured R is such that \(0.30\cdot R_{nom}<R<3\cdot R_{nom}\). For the remaining 10% the upper limit was raised to \(10\cdot R_{nom}\). These requirements followed from technology considerations.

Then it was verified that these limits are compatible with the requirements coming from physics considerations. In any case it is assumed that the resistivity of the ink increases by a factor 3 when going to liquid Argon temperature.

A complication comes from the fact that the electrode is a complicated resistive network which has to be taken into account when resistor values are measured with the test bench.

## 2 What is measured with the test bench

A detailed description of the test benches can be found in [1, 2]. The measurements performed on the electrodes are:

* **M1 : S1 to S2** Individual resistances connecting sampling 1 to sampling 2.
* **M2 : S2 front to S2 back** Resistances in series from the front (front=at smaller r) of the sampling 2 to the back of the sampling 2.
* **M3 : S3 to S3** Individual resistances in the sampling 3
* **M4 : S2 to S3** Individual resistances connecting sampling 2 to sampling 3* **M5: S2 to HV bus**Resistances in series from the back of the sampling 2 to the HV bus.
* **M6: S3 to HV bus**Resistance between third sampling cells and the HV line.

The nominal values are shown in figures 1 to 4.

## 3 Requirements from physics considerations

### Lower limits

#### 3.1.1 Information content of the different measurements

* **M1 :** The resistors connecting sampling one to sampling two are directly measured
* **M4 :** The resistors connecting sampling two to sampling three are measured in parallel with the series of two bias resistors (connecting the electrode pads to the HV line) and the N (depending on \(\eta\)) third sampling resistors. So, once the lower limit on the single resistance is defined, the application of the lower limit to this M4 measurement gives a conservative requirement.
* **M3 :** Same as for M4. Again the lower limits are conservative.
* **M2 :** This gives the sum of the resistors within sampling two. One can apply to this measurement the criteria that the measured resistance should be higher than the lower limit times M, where M is the number of resistors within the sampling itself.
* **M6 (the last pad):** The resistance measured between the last pad of the third sampling and the HV line is again measured in parallel with other resistances. The lower limit is again conservative.
* **M5 (the last pad):** Same as for M6

#### 3.1.2 Results

* The lower limit on resistances within a sampling is 1 K\(\Omega\). The value of 1 \(K\Omega\) is given by considerations on preamplifier protection [4]. The limit to **M2** is then R=1 \(K\Omega\times\)M, where M is the number of resistor within the second sampling. To simplify, it is required that everywhere the limit is 10 \(K\Omega\).
* All resistances connecting samplings larger than 200 k\(\Omega\) are acceptable. This limit is given by cross-talk considerations [4]. There can be resistances connecting different samplings as low as 100 K\(\Omega\), but their number should be smaller than 1%. These limits apply to **M1, M3, M4, M5, M6**.

### Upper limits

#### 3.2.1 Information content of the different measurements

* **M1 :** These resistors induce a voltage drop depending on the current crossing them, which is assumed here to be equal to the ionisation rate in the first sampling
* **M2 :** These resistors induce a voltage drop depending on the current crossing them, which is assumed here to be equal to the ionisation rate in the first + second sampling. It is a little pessimistic since this assumes all the current is seen by all resistors.
* **M5 :** It is the path of current going from the last cell of the second sampling to the HV bus. The current can flow either directly to the bus or through the third sampling. In the latter case, which is the pessimistic one the voltage drop will also depend on the current generated by the ionisation in the third sampling.
* **M6:** The remaining case is that of the current generated by the ionisation in the third sampling, when the first/second sampling current easily flows to the HV bus directly. One should measure the resistance between third sampling cells and the HV line. This determines the drop.

#### 3.2.2 Assumptions

* The voltage drop in a given resistor is calculated from the current in a \(\Delta\eta=0.05\) bin for \(\eta<2.5\) (\(\Delta\eta=0.1\) bin for \(\eta>2.5\)), on one electrode face, as displayed in figure 5.
* Nominal high luminosity (23 inelastic interactions per crossing, on average)
* An HV drop locally less than \(3\cdot 10^{-3}\), corresponding to a \(10^{-3}\) signal loss is acceptable. For \(\eta>2.5\) a \(10^{-2}\) signal loss is accepted.

#### 3.2.3 Results

Figure 6 shows the results of our estimate. All resistor limits larger than \(20~{}M\Omega\) have been set to \(20~{}M\Omega\). Please refer to [3] for the foundations of the calculation.

## 4 Conclusion

The requirement based on \(R/\Box\), mainly based on technology considerations, is consistent with the requirements from physics considerations and therefore can be safely applied.
