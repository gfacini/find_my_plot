## 1 Top-quark pair cross-section measurements

### All channels - ATLAS only

Figure 2: Summary of ATLAS measurements of the top-pair production cross-section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy compared to the NNLO QCD calculation complemented with NNLL resummation (top++2.0). The theory band represents uncertainties due to renormalisation and factorisation scales, parton density functions and the strong coupling. The measurements and the theory calculation are quoted at \(m_{t}=172.5\GeV\). Measurements made at the same centre-of-mass energy are slightly offset for clarity.

Figure 4: Summary of measurements of the top-pair production cross-section at 13 TeV compared to the exact NNLO QCD calculation complemented with NNLL resummation (top++2.0). The theory band represents uncertainties due to renormalisation and factorisation scales, parton density functions and the strong coupling. The measurements and the theory calculation are quoted at \(m_{t}=172.5\) GeV.

For each result, the contribution to the total uncertainty originating from the uncertainty on the theoretical prediction for the single top production cross-section is shown along with the uncertainty originating from the experimental measurement of the cross-section.
