###### Abstract

Muon identification and high momentum measurement accuracy is crucial to fully exploit the physics potential of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. The muon detection system of the ATLAS detector is characterized by two high precision tracking systems, namely the Inner Detector and the Muon Spectrometer, and sufficient calorimetry to ensure the safe absorption of hadrons before the spectrometer, yielding high purity muons with momenta above 3 GeV.

In order to reconstruct and efficiently identify muon tracks, the MOORE and Muld Object-Oriented software packages have been developed within the ATLAS ATHENA framework. The MOORE and Muld algorithms combine to identify track segments in the Muon Spectrometer, to associate them with corresponding segments in the Inner Detector, and to exploit calorimeter information in order to identify muons at their production vertex with optimal parameter resolution.

To identify low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muons that do not have a reconstructed Muon Spectrometer track, other strategies must be employed. We report on a method we developed to identify low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muons and describe the offline performance studies.

## I Introduction

Muon identification and high accuracy in momentum measurement are crucial to fully exploit the physics potential of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC. Events with high momentum muons in the final state are among the most promising and robust signature of "new physics" at LHC.

Lower momentum muons, especially those from J/\(\psi\) decay, are an important signature for b-physics.

The muon detection system of the ATLAS detector is characterized by two high precision tracking systems, the Inner Detector and the Muon Spectrometer. There is sufficient calorimeter depth between them to ensure the absorption of hadrons before the spectrometer, yielding high purity muons with momenta above 3 GeV.

The ATLAS Muon Spectrometer [1] has been designed to achieve momentum measurement with high efficiency and good resolution over a wide range of transverse momentum, pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle. Momentum measurement is performed via the magnetic deflection of muon tracks in a system of three large superconducting air-core toroid magnets instrumented with trigger chambers and high precision tracking chambers.

In order to reconstruct and efficiently identify muon tracks, the MOORE and Muld Object-Oriented software packages have been developed within the ATLAS ATHENA framework. Those software packages are describes elsewhere [2] and [3], we repeat here the relevant information. MOORE identifies track segments using local pattern recognition at the detector module level in each of the three stations of the Muon Spectrometer and performs a track fit, based on the package developed for the Inner Detector, iPatRec [4],[5]. The end result of MOORE is a collection of data objects, which describes the reconstructed tracks at the entrance of the Muon Spectrometer.

The Muld algorithms associate muon tracks, which were reconstructed in the Muon Spectrometer, with the corresponding segments in the Inner Detector. A common fit of the track segments in the Inner Detector and the Muon Spectrometer provides a track with the optimal resolution obtainable with both systems.

Muons with low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) lose a significant part of their energy in the Calorimeter, and thus some of them cannot be reconstructed in the Muon Spectrometer. The identification of these low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muons is important for the b-physics capabilities of ATLAS. Up to 70% of J/\(\psi\) decays may be lost after passing the single muon trigger, because one of the muons has low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\), and is not reconstructed in the Muon Spectrometer. To identify these muons that do not have a reconstructed Muon Spectrometer track, other strategies must be employed. We report on a method we developed to identify low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muons and describe the offline performance studies. The time performance of the algorithm renders it suitable for use in the ATLAS High-Level Trigger system, in addition to the usage inthe offline reconstruction. We will discuss and the adaptation of this algorithm for the Level Two Trigger.

## II The algorithm

The identification of low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muons may utilize muon hits in a variety of sub detectors. This note describes a method that uses hits in all the sub detectors of the Muon Spectrometer. Another method for identifying low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muons relies on the part of the ATLAS Hadron Calorimeter that is made of scintillating tiles [6].

Inner detector tracks are extrapolated to the Muon Spectrometer sub detectors, and there the hits of the muon subdetectors are associated with them according to their proximity in \(\eta\) and \(\varphi\). We use hits from the MDT inner station, the CSC, the RPC middle station, and TGC. We also include the \(\eta\) hits of the trigger chambers, which are not used in MOORE. The advantage of using all possible pieces of information is that muons may be identified even when a specific part of a subdetector is malfunctioning.

This method was found to be efficient and provide good purity for identifying a second low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muon resulting from J/\(\psi\) decay, when one muon from the decay was reconstructed in the Muon Spectrometer.

The user may select to search for J/\(\psi\), for events containing two muons, or for any muon. The output of the algorithm is a list of muon candidates, with the list of elements of information that may identify them as muons. The user will make the selection appropriate for her analysis, based on the information provided. Sample decision examples will be provided when we present the algorithm performance.

## III The program

The low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muon identification starts after the MOORE and Muld reconstruction were performed. It follows these steps:

A new container for Muld muon objects is created in which resulting muon candidates will be stored. Muld muon objects constructed by the Muld program described above are fetched. Each Muld object is inserted into the new container. We calculate the invariant mass of each new candidate with oppositely charged tracks that are already in the container. If the invariant mass is within a given window, both candidates are marked as J/\(\psi\) candidates.

The ID track corresponding to the Muld object is identified and extrapolated to the Muon Spectrometer. Propagation through the solenoidal field is performed to obtain \(\phi\) at the spectrometer entrance. A parameterization of the toroidal field effects is used to extrapolate \(\eta\) to the middle MS station.

Fig. 1 shows the distribution of distances in \(\eta\) between the extrapolated ID track and TGC digits from the middle station, for \(\mu\)+ (red) and \(\mu\)- (green). The top graph shows the raw difference without the toroidal field extrapolation, the middle graph shows the fit of the parameterization function, and the bottom plot shows this distance after the extrapolation.

We then attempt to associate each ID track under consideration with digits in each of the MS sub detectors. An association cut was defined for each sub detector; we count the number of digits passing the cut and record the closest digit to the extrapolated track trajectory. In the initial testing period we collect all the associated digits.

After we have gone over the whole list of Muld objects we proceed to do the same to all other ID tracks. These tracks, which have not been identified as muons by MOORE and Muld, are only included as muon candidates if muon spectrometer hits were associated with them. The new list contains candidates that have either been identified by Muld, or had at least one Muon Spectrometer digit associated with them.

Once we have finished processing tracks we check the results against user requirements. If the user asked for J/\(\psi\)

Fig. 1: Extrapolation of ID tracks to the TGC middle station only, we check that there are two muons that are J/\(\psi\) candidates. If the user asked for di-muons we check that there are two muon candidates. If the user asked for any muons we check that the container is not empty. If the requirement is not met, the container is deleted.

## IV Datasets used

Two samples of simulated events were used in order to develop the program and test its performance. A signal dataset \(\mathrm{A_{b}}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\Lambda\) J/\(\psi\) with J/\(\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)2.5 \(\mu\)4 was used to present all bb \(\rightarrow\) J/\(\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)2.5 \(\mu\)4 channels, since the inclusive dataset was not simulated yet. The notation \(\mu\)2.5 \(\mu\)4 indicates that each event was required to contain two muons, one with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>4\) GeV and the second with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>2.5\) GeV. A sample of bb \(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)6 X, i.e. b-bbar events in which there is a muon with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>6\) GeV, was used to represent the background.

In the calculation of purity we used the following cross sections: \(\sigma\) (bb \(\rightarrow\) J/\(\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)2.5 \(\mu\)4) = 8nb and \(\sigma\)(bb \(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)6 X) = 3600nb

The samples were produced using the Pythia [7] physics generation program. The \(\mathrm{A_{b}}\) decay for the signal was generated using the EvtGen [8] program. The interaction of produced particles with the ATLAS detector was simulated using the GEANT4 package [9]. The resulting events were reconstructed with ATLAS reconstruction release 8.4.0.

## V Association cuts

Fig. 2 shows the distribution of distance in \(\eta\) between the extrapolated ID track and Muon Spectrometer sub detector digits for \(\mu^{+}\)(red) and \(\mu\)(green) for signal/background samples.

Using such distributions to guide us, we decided on the association cuts shown in Table 1.

## VI Algorithm Performance

### Performance for J/\(\psi\) decays

Fig. 3 shows the muon identification efficiency of the Muld algorithm, as a function of muon \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\). The algorithm reaches its maximal efficiency of about 80% for a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of about 5.5 GeV. When trying to reconstruct J/\(\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\mu\)2.5 \(\mu\)4, this algorithm identifies 30% of J/\(\psi\) with purity 52%.

Fig. 4 shows the muon identification efficiency of the algorithm described here, when the decision is based on function of muon \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\). Each track is required to have \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) digits. The trigger chambers are slightly less efficient at \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)\(<\)4 GeV, because there are no RPC in the inner station of the

Fig. 2: The distribution of distance in \(\eta\) between the ID tracks, extrapolated to MS entrance, and MDT digits for signal (top) and background (bottom) dataset. The green/red histogram presents the distributions for muons/anti muons separately, and the black histogram is their sum.

barrel, and some muons never reach the middle station. A selection based on trigger chamber information identifies 66% of J/\(\psi\) with purity 46%.

If we select for maximum efficiency, accepting as a muon each candidate that either has precision chamber digits or has \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) trigger chambers digits, the resulting efficiency is 80% but the purity is only 32%. Such a selection of J/\(\psi\) would be suitable as a level-2 trigger decision. Fig. 6 shows the invariant mass distribution of signal and background for this selection. The red histogram shows pairs of real muons from J/\(\psi\), the blue histogram shows fakes and the yellow are real muons not from J/\(\psi\) decay.

Finally, if we require each candidate to have both precision chamber hits and trigger chamber hits, 60% of J/\(\psi\) particles are identified with purity 69%. Fig. 7 shows the invariant mass distribution of signal and background for this selection.

Comparing the invariant mass distributions, presented in the Fig. 6 and 7, we can see that using the both precision and trigger hits decreases the number of misidentified tracks (blue), and thus improves significantly the purity of the method.

### _Performance for single low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) muons_

Table 2 presents a comparison between the efficiency of the algorithm described in this paper and the Muld algorithm for identifying any muon. The fake rate is calculated from all tracks with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) above 2.3 GeV. The efficiency for low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muons in the single mode can be improved by 40% with respect to Muld, when using a tight selection with the same fake rate. Using an inclusive selection the efficiency is very high, but the fake rate is also higher than with Muld. For muons with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>6\) GeV the differences in efficiency are less significant.

## VII Adaptation for the second level trigger

The simplicity of this algorithm renders it suitable for use in the ATLAS Second-Level Trigger (LVL2), in addition to the usage in the offline reconstruction.

The next goal of this work will be the development of a LVL2 trigger algorithm that increases the number of interesting for B physics events via identification of relatively low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) muons that decay from J/\(\psi\). Our algorithm is suitable

for the trigger because there is no complicated pattern recognition and fitting procedure.

The selection of the level 1 trigger is expected to retain 23 KHz events with one \(\upmu\)\(>\)6 candidate. Only 4 KHz of these are b events, with most others either muons from K/\(\pi\) decays or cavern background.

At the level-2 trigger we select again approximately 1/100 events, so could lose many more b events. Rather than be left with an unbiased fraction of \(\upmu\)\(>\)6, we would like to be efficient for "gold" channels (J/\(\uppsi\)) at level 2.

Fig. 8 compares the expected single muon rates to di-muon and J/\(\uppsi\) rates at low luminosity. For di-muons the horizontal axis shows the \(\rm p_{T}\) of the lower \(\rm p_{T}\) muon. A di-muon trigger will allow for an effective selection of channels with J/\(\uppsi\)\(\uppsi\)\(\uppsi\)\(\uppsi\)\(\uppsi\).

Level two trigger algorithms start from Regions of Interest (ROI) found by the level 1 trigger. In order to find J/\(\uppsi\) we open a search window around the direction of the muon ROI. Fig. 9 shows the distribution of angular distance in \(\upeta\) and \(\upvarphi\) between two muons from J/\(\uppsi\) decay. We find Inner Detector tracks in the search region using the trigger-tracking program IdScan. We read out all Muon Spectrometer sub detectors in the region around each selected track and associate Muon Spectrometer digits (hits) with the Inner Detector track.

This part of the development of the algorithm is at an early stage, but its potential for improving the ATLAS trigger for b physics is very significant.

## VIII Conclusion

We have developed an algorithm for identifying low \(\rm p_{T}\) muons with the ATLAS detector. The user may select the purity and efficiency of his sample by simple cuts on the algorithm output. This algorithm provides significantly better efficiency for identifying muons with \(\rm p_{T}\) below 5 GeV than the previously existing one, without compromising the purity of the resulting muon sample.
