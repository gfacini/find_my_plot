Switched capacitor array chips were exposed to the proton beam of the PS and the electron beam of LIL at CERN during June 11-July 7, 1994. We present empirical results of the radiation and temperature sensitivity of the switched capacitor array.

Introduction

A simple readout PC board was assembled for the tests. Different switched capacitor array (SCA) chips could be plugged into a single socket on the board. Four of the 16 SCA channels were multiplexed through two 12-bit ADCs. A separate controller provided a random read address allowing a single capacitor in each channel to be read out at a rate of approximately 200 Hz.

A proton beam from the PS or electron beam from LIL could be directed onto the SCA chip during operation and the beam flux measured. Tests were performed by running the SCA with or without a DC voltage applied to the inputs. The readout board could also be operated in an oven with an accuracy of \(\pm 3^{o}\)C to study the temperature sensitivity and possible annealing of the chip.

The data files and number of events recorded for each run are presented in the appendix. In total, 35 runs were performed with six different SCA chips. Table 1 summarizes the tests performed with each SCA chip. The runs are summarized in table 2.

When a SCA chip has voltage applied, about 0.2% of the ADC counts are approximately 100 counts above pedestal. These counts are significantly different from the others and are believed to be due to an error in the SCA chip.

For each of the 256 capacitors in each channel, a distribution of the number of ADC counts was accumulated, and the mean and rms deviation calculated. In some cases, the tails of the ADC distribution were truncated \(\pm 40\) ADC counts around the mean counts for each capacitor, and the mean and rms deviation recalculated. In the following tables, the mean ADC counts for each channel is the mean ADC counts over all capacitors in the channel. The noise for each channel is an average of the rms deviation of each capacitor in the channel. The global mean ADC counts is the mean ADC counts over all capacitors and all channels, while the global noise is an average of the rms deviation of each capacitor in all channels.

The following sections present the empirical results of the tests and are grouped according to each SCA chip tested. SCA2 and SCA5 were found to be defective and will not be reported on here.

## 2 Effects of Proton Irradiation and Annealing

This test uses SCA0 in runs 1-2, 5-6, 8-18 and 20. Two baseline runs with and without voltage applied were performed (runs 1 and 2) and the results are shown in table 3. _The noise is lower when voltage is applied. About half of the pedestal noise is due to tails in the ADC distributions_.

The chip under voltage was irradiated with the proton beam from the PS for part of a run (run 5). A description of the run under voltage is shown in the first part of table 4. The voltage was disconnected from the inputs and the chip was irradiated again for part of a run (run 6). A description of the run with the voltage removed is shown in the second part of table 4. The chip was irradiated for a total of 0.8 hr and received \(1.5\times 10^{13}\) protons/cm\({}^{2}\). We estimate the total absorbed does to be 0.5 Mrad.

The number of ADC counts versus event number (time) for the first 1.2 hr of the irradiation runs, with and without voltage applied, are shown in figures 1 and 2 respectively. _With voltage applied to the chip, the number of ADC counts dropped to zero in all channels after initial irradiation. With additional irradiation, the number of ADC counts in all channels rose above the baseline counts; two of the channels even saturated. Without voltage applied, irradiation caused the number of ADC counts in all channels to rise above

the baseline counts; two of the channels saturated. Irradiation removed the tails in the ADC distributions when voltage was applied to the chip._

Table 5 shows the mean ADC and noise counts about 36 hr after irradiation (runs 8 and 9). _The baseline pedestals and gains were not recovered after 36 hr. However, the intrinsic noise of the chip decreased by about 35% and the tails in the ADC distributions vanished._

A series of heating runs were performed with SCA0 (runs 10-18) after irradiation. The resulting pedestal and noise counts for the different oven temperature settings are shown in table 6. Figure 3 shows the number of ADC counts versus event number for a 10 hr run after the chip was heated and cooled down (run 18). _The noise increased while the chip was heated. During cool-down to room temperature, channels 0 and 2 showed discrete jumps in the number of ADC counts in parts of the runs. This effect was observed both when the chip was cooled inside or outside the oven. After heating and cool-down the pedestal counts were closer to the baseline counts but still significantly different. The noise was not affected by heating and cooling._

Table 7 shows the mean ADC and noise counts about 89 hr after irradiation and attempted annealing (run 20). _The chip has recovered to the baseline pedestal counts to within about 30 counts and the baseline ADC counts with voltage applied to within about 120 counts; still significantly different from the baseline counts. The pedestal noise has decreased by about 24% from the baseline but the noise with voltage applied has increased by about a

factor of six. About half the noise when voltage was applied was due to the tails in the ADC distributions._

## 3 Effects of Electron Irradiation

This test uses SCA6 in runs 27- 33. Baseline runs with and without voltage applied to the chip were performed (runs 27-29) and the results are shown in table 8. _The noise is higher when voltage is applied. About half of the pedestal noise is due to tails in the ADC distributions._

The chip was irradiated with the electron beam from LIL for part of a run (run 30) and received a flux of \(5.285\times 10^{12}\) electrons/cm\({}^{2}\) after about 1.8 hr. Figure 4 shows the number of ADC counts versus event number for 1.7 hr of the irradiation run. _With voltage applied to the chip, the ADC counts in all channels dropped quickly to about 100 counts after irradiation. The noise increased significantly just before the number of ADC counts started to drop. The tails in the ADC distributions merged with the mean ADC counts during and after the chip began to fail._

After electron irradiation the chip was observed with voltage applied (runs 31- 33). The number of ADC counts began to rise after about 18.5 hr, 27.5 hr, 32.5 hr and 32.5 hr for channels 3, 1, 0 and 2 respectively. Figure 5 shows the number of ADC counts versus event number for the last run (run 33). Table 9 shows the truncated mean ADC and noise counts before and after irradiation. _The number of ADC counts in each channel began to rise about 28 hr after irradiation. After about two days the number of ADC counts in each channel were still far from the baseline counts and the noise was about an order of magnitude larger than the baseline noise. When voltage was applied to the chip, irradiation with electrons did not remove the tails in the ADC distributions. The chip was essentially damaged._

## 4 Temperature Effects

This test uses SCA3 in runs 19, 21-22 and 24. Two baseline runs with and without voltage applied to the chip were performed (runs 19 and 21) and the results are shown in table 10. _About half of the pedestal noise is due to tails in the ADC distributions._

The chip was placed into an oven with the voltage removed and a series of pedestal tests performed at different temperatures (run 21). The resulting pedestal and noise counts for the different oven temperature settings are shown in table 11.

_Jumps in the number of ADC counts were observed in channels 0 and 2 when the temperature rose to 50\({}^{\circ}\)C and dropped to 35\({}^{\circ}\)C. The pedestal and noise counts for channels 1 and 3 did not change after heating. However, for channels 0 and 2 the pedestal counts increased by about 19 counts and the noise approximately doubled._

An additional run was performed at room temperature about 14 hr after heating with-out and with voltage applied (run 22). A final pedestal run was performed about 33 hr after heating to see if the chip had completely recovered from the oven (run 24). Table 12 show the truncated mean ADC and noise counts with voltage applied before and after the chip was heated. _With voltage applied to the chip, the truncated mean ADC counts decreased by about three counts after heating, while the noise did not change significantly. Heating the chip did not remove the tails in the ADC distributions._

## 5 Death by Protons

This test uses SCA1 in runs 3-4, 7 and 23. Two baseline runs with and without voltage applied were performed (runs 3 and 4) and the results are showing in table 13.

_The noise was lower when voltage was applied. The tails in the ADC distributions dominant the pedestal noise._

_We suspect the sample and holds on channels 2 and 3 are defective._

Figure 6 shows the number of ADC counts versus event number for the irradiation run (run 7). After about 0.8 hr the beam was turned on and the chip died about another 0.5 hr later. During irradiation the chip received \(3.79\times 10^{12}\) protons/cm\({}^{2}\), which corresponds to an absorbed dose of about 0.3 Mrad. _Like SCA0, the pedestal increased with irradiation_.

The dead chip under voltage was later placed into the oven and an attempt to recover the baseline counts by annealing was performed (run 23). The truncated mean ADC and noise counts are shown in table 15. _Although the number of ADC counts increased and noise counts decreased, the chip did not recover by annealing._

## 6 Death by Electrons

This test uses SCA4 in runs 25-26 and 34-35. Two baseline runs with and without voltage applied to the chip were performed (runs 25 and 26) and the results are shown in table 16. _The noise is lower when voltage is applied. About half of the pedestal noise is due to tails in the ADC distributions._

During the electron irradiation of SCA6 (run 30), SCA4 was taped to the back of the

After electron irradiation the chip was observed both without and with voltage applied (runs 34 and 35). In both cases all channels had saturated ADC counts except for capacitors 222-225. These capacitors were never read out. Instead capacitors 226 and 227 were read out about four times and twice as often, respectively, as the remaining capacitors. _The chip with no bias voltage applied during electron irradiation was damaged; all the ADC counts were saturated. This was the only run in which individual capacitors or addressing failed._

## 7 Summary

1. In most cases, the radiation doses were too high and the chips were damaged; the number of ADC counts dropped to zero or saturated. Electron irradiation with no bias voltage applied to the chip damaged the addressing for six capacitors in each channel.
2. If a chip was still operational after irradiation, the pedestals and gains changed. Chips did not completely recover from irradiation after long periods of time.
3. In the case of proton irradiation, the intrinsic noise of the chip decreased by approximately 35% about a day and a half after irradiation. Almost four days after proton irradiation, the pedestal noise was approximately 25% lower than the baseline, but the noise with voltage applied was about six times larger. When voltage was applied to the chip, proton irradiation removed the 0.2% of events with ADC counts approximately 100 counts above pedestal. Attempts to recover the pedestal and gains by annealing was partially successful. The intrinsic noise of the chip was not affected by annealing.
4. Attempts to recover dead or almost dead chips after irradiation by annealing failed.
5. Heating a chip that had not been irradiated changed the pedestals and gains by a small amount. While the noise in some channels was not affected, other channels showed significant noise increases.
