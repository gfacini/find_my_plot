###### Abstract

The ATLAS experiment being designed for the CERN LHC will include a large silicon microstrip tracking detector. This must operate in a high radiation environment for at least 10 years, maintaining a satisfactory detector performance despite the resulting progressive and severe changes in the material properties of the silicon and dielectric.

The design, simulation, prototyping and evaluation of appropriate microstrip detectors for these conditions has been in progress for several years within collaborating laboratories and industrial companies. This has resulted in a choice of design which emphasises survivability and makes allowance for the uncertainties in the anticipated radiation environment and device deterioration.

The ATLAS tracker requires one (nearly square) 'barrel' detector design for the majority of the silicon wafers and five slightly different designs for the (wedge shaped) 'forward' detectors which are to be built into disks. The specifications apply to all designs except for the small geometrical differences required for the 'forward' detectors. The final overall production requirement for ATLAS will be for about 20,000 detectors.

## ATLAS Microstrip Detector Specifications

After the radiation doses anticipated after 10 years running at the LHC, all the strip detectors are expected to have significantly changed their device properties. Bulk damage will have altered the detectors' depletion characteristics with the charge collection region growing from the \(n\)-implant side with bias voltage. The voltage needed for full depletion will rise to many hundreds of volts and the possibility of having to operate partially depleted is a major motivation for the choice of \(n-\)side read-out. In addition, surface damage will have raised the oxide-silicon interface charge by an order of magnitude and designs will need to balance the requirements of low capacitance with those of avoiding high field regions and possible breakdown.

In the following pages the issues for the mask designs are separated from the device properties (which give the device performance which each detector must fulfill) and the requirements, which are the goals of the designs and which are necessary, but not testable on a device by device basis. The section on processing reflects the best knowledge we have on how the requirements for operation in the severe radiation environment at the LHC may be met and any alternatives to these proposals will have to be proven in radiation tests up to a proton fluence of \(\sim 2\times 10^{14}\)cm\({}^{-2}\).

Once prototypes have been delivered which are proven to be satisfactory both before and after the radiation tests, it is the company's responsibility to ensure no changes in processing occur which could compromise this performance. It would be desirable for the collaboration to have access to process monitoring test structures, where these can be made available, to ensure any changes during the delivery period are identified quickly and to have the possibility of some diagnostics should problems arise.

Unless stated explicitly otherwise, all dimensions quoted are those to be found in the processed devices, not the dimensions on the mask designs which may vary between suppliers.

Processing techniques to further improve the high voltage performance are under discussion with manufacturers. This list of specifications is for the main prototype order and any exploratory work on variants to this design will be subject to separate negotiations.

* **DETECTOR MASK REQUIREMENTS**
* **Overall device length:** 64mm, cutting line of scribe to cutting line of scribe.
* **Overall device width:** 63.6mm, cutting line of scribe to cutting line of scribe.
* **Number of strips:** 768+2
* **Number read out:** 768
* **Read-out implant strip dimensions:*
* 18\(\mu\)m wide, 62mm long, 80\(\mu\)m pitch, high doped \(n-\)implants. (As stated above, these are the dimensions in the device)
* Sensitive region 62mm long by 61.6mm wide. **Figure 1 shows the overall device layout and locations of bias contacts, bond pads, alignment features, identification marks,**_etc_
* **Read-out strips:** Aluminium, capacitively coupled (see below) over the \(n-\)implant strips with processed aluminium edge \(\geq 1\mu\)m everywhere within the processed boundary of the implant strips. The capacitance and metal resistance requirements imply that these gaps should be as close to 1\(\mu\)m as mask alignment tolerances _etc_ allow.
* **Isolation technique:** Individual \(p-\)stops (see below) with implanted \(p-\)strips normally of 17\(\mu\)m width. The gaps between the \(p-\)implants should be \(\geq 6\mu\)m and the _nominal_ distance _in the device_ between \(n\) and \(p\) structures should everywhere be \(\geq 10\mu\)m. The requirement of no \(p\)implant below the bond pads requires that the width of the implanted \(p-\)stop lines reduces to 8\(\mu\)m in this region. **Figure 2 shows the layout required in the bond pad region**
* **Bias resistors:** Either overlapping the implanted strips or contained within the guard ring region.
* **Sensitive region to cut edge distance:** 1mm.
* **Outermost guard to cut edge distance:** \(\geq 500\mu m\).
* **Back contact and guard designs:** Large contactable \(p-\)implant matching \(n-\)implant dimensions up to first guard. \(p-\)side guard rings _contacted_ to overlapping aluminium _broader_ than the implants. \(n-\)side with both \(n\) and \(p\) implanted guard rings. Only \(n-\)type guard rings contacted to broader overlapping aluminium rings. **See figure 3 (adjacent to bond pads) and figure 4 (corner region) for one proposed design.
* **Read-out:** \(200\times 56\mu m\) bond pads, \(\geq\) two rows, daisy-chainable. **See figure 1**
* \(n-\)**bias contacts:** Available at each corner. **See figure 1**
* **Strip evaluation:** Probe points to read-out strip implants at contact point to bias resistors.
* **Guard rings:** Probe points required away from other connections on prototype run only.
* **Passivation:** Detectors to be passivated on both sides using silicon oxide.
* **Test structures:** Large diode, large capacitor, MOS capacitors, test resistors (polysilicon, implants, aluminium) (To be negotiated). **See figure 5 for ATLAS designed test structure block available on request
* **Identification:** Every 10\({}^{th}\) strip to be clearly numbered, scratch pads **to be used** for detector labeling and agreed alignment marks for module optical metrology required. **See figure 1. (Detailed designs will be supplied to manufacturers)* **DETECTOR MECHANICAL/OPTICAL PROPERTIES**
* **External cut dimensions:** 64mm by 63.6mm with \(\pm 25\mu\)m tolerance. Edge chipping to be avoided.
* **Thickness:** 300 \(\pm\) 15\(\mu\)m.
* **Uniformity of thickness:** \(\pm\)10\(\mu\)m.
* **Mask alignment tolerances:** \(\leq\)3\(\mu m\) misalignment with respect to any other mask. Depends on final tolerances of design.
* **Damage:** Device free from large scratches and gross defects.
* **DETECTOR Electrical PROPERTIES**
* **Strips:** n-implant \(<\) 200K\(\,\Omega\)/cm.
* **Read-out strips:** Aluminium \(<\) 20\(\Omega\)/cm
* **R\({}_{\text{BIAS}}\) :** 1.5\(\pm\)0.5\(\,\)M\(\,\Omega\) polysilicon bias.
* **C\({}_{\text{coupling}}\):** \(>\) 10pF /cm
* **Depletion voltage:** \(V_{\text{depletion}}<\) 100V.
* **Total initial leakage** _incl_ **guard:** \(<\) 6\(\mu A\) at 150V and \(<\) 20\(\mu A\) at 200V is **to be verified by manufacturer**. That I increases by \(<\) 2\(\mu\)A after 24 hours in dry air is further a requirement to establish stability but this need not be the manufacturer's task to verify.
* **Processing reproducibility:** To be monitored **by manufacturer** on test structures (\(V_{\text{FB}}\), \(t_{\alpha\text{r}}\), implant and polysilicon resistivity, aluminium sheet resistance, etching uniformity, dielectric strength). To check the dielectric integrity we require \(I<\) lnA/cm\({}^{2}\) after 1 hour at 100V measured on large area test structures. This is needed to ensure adequate protection against 'beam splashes' occurring when the detector is being operated at high voltage.
* **BAD STRIPS**
* **Coupling dielectric:** Shorts through dielectric at 50\(\,V\)
* **Defective strips:** Metal/diode breaks or shorts to neighbours
* **Polysilicon connection:** Strip connection to bias via polysilicon broken
* **Strip testing:** The above failure conditions will be checked for by ATLAS using both current measurements across the oxide on each strip, to verify the manufacturer's list of shorted strips, and by using an impedance meter to measuring capacitance, \(C\), vs strip number to the bias rail at a typical frequency of 100KHz. Defective strips reveal themselves as falling outside the range \(0.75\tilde{C}<C<1.5\tilde{C}\), where \(\tilde{C}\) is the mean capacitance measured on that device. Failure modes other than dielectric damage should be rare unless there is a problem with masks or processing which would probably affect the whole batch. We would require that these defects are not present at the levels that takes the bad strip count outside the acceptance, but we would not expect the supplier to check for these failure conditions.
* **Acceptance testing:** Each aluminium strip is to be contacted with a probe and checked for shorts (_ie_ no current) through the oxide at 50V **by the manufacturer**.
* **Total bad strip acceptance:** We require a mean acceptance of 99\(\,\%\) in each delivery with no devices below 98\(\%\).

* **DATA SHEETS FOR EACH DETECTOR**
* **IV curves** We require the plot of \(I\) against \(V\) up to 200V.
* **Depletion voltage** We require the value of the wafer depletion voltage.
* **Thickness** We require the value for the wafer thickness.
* **Bad strips** We require either the manufacturer's list of bad strips or the plot of \(C\)_vs_ strip number.
* **REQUINED PERFORMANCE**

No detector is suitable that does not satisfy the additional requirements listed below both **before** and **after** irradiation at the corresponding maximum operating voltages. However, these criteria cannot be checked on a detector by detector basis and therefore we are constrained to demand that prototypes have been delivered that satisfied these conditions and that the design and processing for the main delivery are the same as for the successful prototypes.

* **Maximum operating voltage:** 150V initial, 300V after equivalent of \(\sim 2\times 10^{14}\)protons/cm\({}^{2}\). (Detector well past inversion dose)
* \(\mathbf{R}_{\mathrm{inter-strip}}\): \(>2\times R_{BIAS}\) at maximum operating voltage.
* \(\mathbf{C}_{\mathrm{Total-Load}}\): \(<1.2\)pF/cm at maximum operating voltage.
* **Strip Current:**\(<1\mu\)A per read-out strip at -10\({}^{o}\)C and 300V after equivalent of \(2\times 10^{14}\)protons/cm\({}^{2}\). \(<50nA\) at 150V, prior to irradiation.
* **Total Current:**\(<1\)mA at -10\({}^{o}\)C and 300V after equivalent of \(2\times 10^{14}\)protons/cm\({}^{2}\).
* **Micro-discharge:** No excess noise due to this effect at the maximum operating voltage. (This can only be checked after connection to electronics)
* **Bad strips:** After irradiation, the numbers of strips failing the pre-irradiation criteria should remain within the pre-irradiation acceptances.
* **PROCESSING**

The aim is to satisfy the performance requirements and alternatives proven to \(2\times 10^{14}\)protons/cm\({}^{2}\) will also be considered.

* **Strips:**\(n\)-implant of \(>10^{14}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) and \(1-1.5\mu\)m implant depth.
* **Strip Capacitor Dielectric:** Silicon oxide and silicon nitride layers
* **Back contact:**\(p\)-implant of \(>10^{14}\)/cm\({}^{2}\)
* **Isolation:**\(p\)-stops of \(>10^{13}\)/cm\({}^{2}\) (Doping maximum near oxide interface)
* **Substrate doping:** n-type, 3K\(\Omega\)cm\(<\rho<8\)K\(\Omega\)cm
* **Substrate oxygen concentrations:**\(5\times 10^{15}\) cm\({}^{-3}\), typical, \(<10^{16}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)
* **Substrate carbon concentrations:**\(5\times 10^{15}\) cm\({}^{-3}\), typical, \(<2\times 10^{16}\) cm
