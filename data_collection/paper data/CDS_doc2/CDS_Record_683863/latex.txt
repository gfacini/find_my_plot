**ABSTRACT**

The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to the top-quark rare decay via flavor-changing neutral currents \(t\to Zq\) (\(q\) represents \(c\) and \(u\) quarks) has been studied at \(\sqrt{s}\)=14 TeV in two decay modes:

1.The pure leptonic decay of gauge bosons: \(t\bar{t}\to ZqWb\to l^{+}l^{-}j^{\pm}\nu b\), (l=e, \(\mu\)).

2.The leptonic decay of Z bosons and hadronic decay of W bosons: \(t\bar{t}\to ZqWb\to l^{+}l^{-}jjjb\), (l=e, \(\mu\)).

The dominant backgrounds \(Z+jets\), \(WZ\) and \(t\bar{t}\) have been analysed. The signal and backgrounds were generated via PYTHIA 5.7, and simulated and analysed using ATLFAST 2.14. A branching ratio for \(t\to Zq\) as low as 2.0x10\({}^{-4}\) for the leptonic mode and 5.9x10\({}^{-4}\) for hadronic mode could be discovered at the 5\(\sigma\) level with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Introduction

The existence of the top quark has been established at the Fermilab Tevatron by the CDF and DO Collaborations [1]. Due to the large value of the top quark mass, of order the Fermi scale, the top quark couples strongly to the electroweak symmetry breaking sector. If anomalous top quark couplings beyond the Standard Model (SM) exist, they could affect top quark production and decay processes at hadron and \(e^{+}\)\(e^{-}\) colliders [2, 3]. For example, study of the flavour-changing neutral current top quark decay \(t\to Zq\) (where \(q\) represents either \(c\) or \(u\) quarks) is of great interest. As is well known [4, 5], the LHC can be considered as a "top factory", producing about \(80,000\)\(t\overline{t}\) events per day at \(L=10^{33}\)\(cm^{-2}\)\(s^{-1}\), making the LHC an ideal place to explore this rare decay.

In this note, we present a study of the sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment to the branching ratio of the top-quark rare decay mode \(t\to Zq\) (\(q=u,c\)). In the framework of the Standard Model, the loop suppression and heaviness of gauge bosons make this process extremely rare. The SM prediction for the branching ratio, of order \(10^{-13}\)[6], would render the decay unobservable even with the large samples of top quarks expected at the LHC. However, other models predict significantly larger branching ratios for this process. For example, in two-Higgs-doublet models, the value of \(\mbox{Br}(t\to Zq)\) can reach \(\sim 10^{-9}\)[7], while Supersymmetric (SUSY) models (without \(R\)-parity) can have even much higher values, \(\mbox{Br}(t\to Zq)\)\(\sim 10^{-4}\)[8].

Experimentally, little is known about this decay. The only existing limit comes from a CDF analysis of its Run1 data [9], yielding \(\mbox{Br}(t\to Zq)<33\%\) (95% CL). Given the SM prediction, an observation of this decay mode, even at the LHC, would provide a clear signal of new physics beyond the SM, such as new dynamical interactions of top quark, multi-Higgs doublets, exotic fermions or other possibilities [5, 6, 7]. In addition, this mode is of interest since, if the branching ratio were large, events of the form \(t\overline{t}\to ZZ+c\epsilon\) could prove to be a serious background to events containing \(Z\) boson pairs and jets from cascade decays of squarks and gluinos [10].

The dominant mechanism for top quark production at the LHC is \(t\overline{t}\) pair production via \(gg,q\overline{q}\to t\overline{t}\). The analyses presented here focus on two different final state topologies of \(t\overline{t}\to ZqWb\):

1. The purely leptonic decay of both gauge bosons:

\(t\to Zq\to l^{+}l^{-}j\), \(\overline{t}\to Wb\to l^{\pm}\nu b\) (l=e, \(\mu\))

2. The leptonic decay of the Z boson and hadronic decay of the W boson:

\(t\to Zq\to l^{+}l^{-}j\), \(\overline{t}\to Wb\to jjb\) (l=e, \(\mu\))The value of the branching ratio of the second ("hadronic") mode is three times higher than for the first ("leptonic") one. However, the hadronic mode suffers from enormous QCD-backgrounds, while the leptonic mode has a very distinct experimental signature. Both modes have been studied, and the results of each analysis will be presented below.

## 2 Monte Carlo Event Generation

The dominant source of top quark production at the LHC is pair-production via \(gg,q\bar{q}\to t\bar{t}\). PYTHIA 5.7 was set up to produce \(t\bar{t}\) events at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and \(m_{top}=174\) GeV, with proton structure functions CTEQ2L. Initial and final state QED and QCD (ISR, FSR) radiation, multiple interactions, fragmentations and decays of unstabled particles were enabled.

The decay \(t\to Zq\) is not implemented in the standard release of PYTHIA. To include this process in PYTHIA, all individual decay channels of the top quark were first switched off, except for \(t\to Wb\) and \(t\to Ws\). The channel \(t\to Ws\) was then replaced by the decay \(t\to Zq\), by replacing \(W\) by \(Z\) and \(s\) by \(c(u)\). The total cross-section for \(t\bar{t}\) production was assumed to be \(\sigma_{t\overline{t}}\)=800 pb [12].

The analyses reconstructed the \(Z\) boson via its leptonic decay, \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\). The experimental signature included, therefore, a pair of isolated charged leptons, as well as several jets. The SM backgrounds considered for this process were \(Z+jets\) production, \(WZ\) production, and \(t\bar{t}\to WbWb\) production.

\(Z+jets\) production at the LHC has a relatively large cross-section, dominated by \(qg\to Zq\) and \(q\bar{q}\to Zg\) processes. To decrease the size of the background sample which needed to be generated, thresholds were imposed at the generator level on the invariant mass, \(\hat{m}=\sqrt{\hat{s}}>130\) GeV, and transverse momentum, \(\hat{p_{\perp}}>50\) GeV, of the hard scattering process. The cross-section for this subsample of events was \(\sigma_{Z+jets}\)=3186 pb.

The \(WZ\) background is the electroweak process \(pp\to W^{\pm}Z+X\), and has an assumed cross-section of \(\sigma_{WZ}\) = 26.58 pb.

The performance of the ATLAS detector was simulated using the fast simulation package ATLFAST 2.14 [11], which uses parametrizations of the detector resolution functions.

## 3 The Leptonic Decay Mode

The final state for the leptonic decay mode is \(t\bar{t}\to ZqWb\to l^{+}l^{-}jl\nu b\). The experimental signature therefore includes three isolated charged leptons, two of which reconstruct a \(Z\) boson, and large missing transverse energy due to the neutrino.

The backgrounds considered were \(Z+jets\) production, followed by the decay \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\), \(pp\to W^{\pm}Z+X\to l^{\pm}\nu l^{+}l^{-}\,+X\), and \(t\bar{t}\to W^{+}bW^{-}\tilde{b}\to l^{+}\nu bl^{-}\,\tilde{\nu}b\). Background samples of \(2.1\times 10^{7}Z+jets\) events, 35700 \(WZ\) events, and \(3.7\times 10^{6}\)\(t\bar{t}\) events were generated. Assuming the production cross-sections given earlier, and including the relevant branching ratios, these background samples correspond to an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Table 1 summarizes the effects of the sequential application of the various analysis cuts on the background samples and on the sample of 20565 signal events of the topology \(t\bar{t}\to ZqWb\to l^{+}l^{-}jl\nu b\).

Preselection cuts were first applied, requiring the presence of at least three charged leptons (electrons with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV and muons with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV) within pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\). Of these, at least one pair of leptons must be of opposite sign and same flavour, compatible with them being produced from a \(Z\) decay. In addition, the number of jets in the event with \(p_{T}^{jet}>15\) GeV was required to be at least two. The requirement of three leptons reduces significantly the \(Z+jets\) and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds, while the requirement of two jets reduces significantly \(WZ\) and \(Z+jets\) backgrounds.

The lepton criteria were then tightened, by requiring the presence of at least three isolated, charged leptons (electrons or muons) with \(p_{T}^{l}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta^{l}|<2.5\). The isolation criterion required that there be no additional track with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV in a cone

of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}=0.3\) around the lepton direction. Fig. 1 presents the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the two leptons consistent with originating from a \(Z\) decay for signal and backgrounds, while Fig. 2 shows the \(p_{T}\) distribution for the third lepton. Tightening the lepton criteria significantly reduces the \(Z+jets\) and \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds, where any third lepton found typically comes from cascade decays of \(b\)-jets.

The next requirement, namely that the missing transverse momentum in the event satisfies \(p_{T}^{miss}>30\) GeV, is effective at further reducing the \(Z+jets\) background (see Fig. 3), while having little impact on the signal and other background sources.

Next, it was demanded that there be at least two jets with \(p_{T}^{jet}>50\) GeV, \(|\eta^{jet}|<2.5\), and satisfying the following isolation conditions: \(\Delta R_{jj}>0.4\) (jet-jet isolation) and \(\Delta R_{lj}>0.4\) (lepton-jet isolation). Fig. 4 presents the number of jets with \(p_{T}^{jet}>50\) GeV in an event. One can see that the cut requiring the presence of two and more such jets in each event effectively suppresses the \(WZ\) background.

The presence of a reconstructed \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) decay is a powerful cut against the \(t\overline{t}\) background. A like-sign, same-flavor pair of isolated leptons was required to reconstruct to the \(Z\) mass within a window of \(M_{Z}\pm 6\) GeV mass window. Fig. 5(a) presents the distribution of reconstructed invariant mass of \(ll\) pairs \(m_{ll}\), for all dilepton combinations for the signal events. The width of the accepted window corresponds to approximately

twice the \(Z\) mass resolution of about 2.9 GeV.

The next requirement was the presence in the event of one tagged \(b\)-jet, which is effective at further reducing the \(WZ\) background (see Fig. 6).

Finally, a peak at the top quark mass in the \(Zj\) invariant mass distribution was sought. In Fig. 5(b), the distribution of reconstructed invariant mass \(m_{llj}\) for all combinations of \(llj\) is presented for the signal events. The top quark mass resolution is \(\sigma\left(m_{llj}\right)=14\) GeV. Accepted combinations were required to lie within a window around the known top quark mass. As a check of the stability of the results, three different mass window were considered: \(m_{Zj}=m_{t}\pm 8\) GeV (narrow cut), \(m_{t}\pm 12\) GeV (\(\sim~{}\sigma\)), and \(m_{t}\)\(\pm 24\) GeV (\(\sim~{}2\sigma\)). The top mass window removes almost completely the remaining background.

As summarized in Table 3, the final signal efficiency was 6.1% for the \(m_{t}\)\(\pm 24\) GeV mass window, with a total background of 7 events for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). The results in the table do not yet include the lepton identification efficiencies. Assuming an efficiency of 90% for each of the three leptons, the results correspond to a 5\(\sigma\) discovery potential for Br(\(t\to Zq\)) as low as 2.0x10\({}^{-4}\) and for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). This result is in good agreement with that of reference [13].

## 4 The Hadronic Decay Mode

The final state for the hadronic W decay mode is \(t\overline{t}\to ZcWb\to l^{+}l^{-}jjjb\). The experimental signature for the hadronic mode includes, therefore, two isolated charged leptons which originate from the \(Z\) decay, and four energetic jets.

This mode has the following backgrounds: \(Z(\to ll)+jets,\ pp\to W^{\pm}Z+X\to jjl^{+}l^{-}+X\), and \(t\overline{t}\to WbWb\) with the final state topologies (a) \(l^{+}\nu bl^{-}\tilde{\nu}b\), (b) \(jjbjjb\), or (c) \(l^{\pm}\nu bjjb\). In the case of (a), the additional two jets must come from QCD radiation, while in (b) and (c) the source of leptons is from cascade decays. Therefore, requiring

Figure 5: (a) Distribution of reconstructed invariant mass of the lepton pairs, \(m_{ll}\) for the leptonic mode. (b) Distribution of reconstructed invariant mass of \(t\to Zq\to llj\) for the leptonic mode.

two isolated energetic leptons and four energetic jets, among which only one is tagged as a \(b\)-jet, significantly suppresses the \(t\bar{t}\) background. It has been checked that the small remaining \(t\bar{t}\) background is removed by the reconstruction cuts asking for \(m_{l\hskip-1.0ptl}\) and \(m_{l\hskip-1.0ptl}\) to lie within windows around \(m_{Z}\) and \(m_{t}\) respectively. Therefore, the \(t\bar{t}\) background is reduced to a negligible level, and is not considered further.

Background samples of \(2.1\times 10^{7}Z+jets\) events, and \(1.2\times 10^{5}WZ\) events were generated. Assuming the production cross-sections given earlier, and including the relevant branching ratios, these background samples correspond to an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Table 3 summarizes the effects of the sequential application of the various analysis cuts on the background samples and on the sample of 19000 signal events of the topology \(t\bar{t}\to ZqWb\to l^{+}l^{-}jjjb\).

The analysis began with preselection cuts requiring that the event contains at least two charged leptons (electrons with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV within pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\) and muons with \(P_{T}>6\) GeV within pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.4\)), and include a pair of opposite-sign and same-flavour leptons, compatible with them having come from a \(Z\) decay. In addition, the number of jets with \(p_{T}^{jet}>15\) GeV was required to be at least four. After preselection cuts, 46% of the signal events are accepted, while only 3.5% and 4.1% of the

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

The results in Table 3 imply that a value of Br(t \(\rightarrow\) Zq ) as low as 5.9x10\({}^{-4}\) could be discovered at the 5\(\sigma\) level with an integrated luminosity 100 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 5 Conclusions

We have studied the ATLAS sensitivity to the FCNC top quark rare decay \(t\to Zq\) (\(q=u,c\)) for an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\).

As summarized in Table 3, the results demonstrate that, in the leptonic mode, a branching ratio as low as 2.0x10\({}^{-4}\) and, in the hadronic mode, as low as 5.9x10\({}^{-4}\) could

be discovered at the \(5\sigma\) level with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Table 3 compares the relative efficiences of some of the important kinematic cuts for leptonic and hadronic modes of the signal. One can see that the relative efficiences of leptons, jets, \(Z\) mass, \(b\)-jet and top mass cuts for leptonic and hadronic modes are in good agreement, as expected. This agreement supports the consistency of the two analyses, despite different versions of the ATLFAST code being used in the two cases.

Combining the results from the two decay modes extends the \(5\sigma\) discovery potential down to a branching ratio as low as 1.8x10\({}^{-4}\).
