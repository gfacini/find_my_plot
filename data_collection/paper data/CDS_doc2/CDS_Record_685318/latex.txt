Introduction

For the drift tubes of the ATLAS MDT chambers, the ground contact resistance of the aluminum tube cathode is required to stay below 100 m\(\Omega\) over the lifetime of the experiment (for currents \(\leq 10\) mA). The aluminum tube is crimped on the aluminum ground ring of the endplug. Measurements of the ground contact resistance of tubes in the BML 98 MDT prototype chamber have shown that the simple crimp contact between the two aluminum surfaces is not sufficient. Under normal environmental conditions the contact deteriorated to 10 times the allowed resistance values in less than 1 year.

In order to achieve a reliable ground contact over long term, laser spot welding between the ends of the aluminum tubes and the endplug ground rings has been proposed and applied to the 142 drift tubes manufactured at MPI for one multilayer of the BML 98 chamber. The cross section of the drift tubes and endplugs is shown in Figure 1.

During one year the ground contacts of these tubes did not deteriorate; the resistance, measured at 10 mA, stayed at 10 m\(\Omega\). The welding spots in this case were applied at the edge of the tube. The endplug aluminum alloy used was AlMgSi1.

Laser point welding can be applied to the existing endplug design (see Figure 2). It does not require the use of agressive chemicals and does not heat up the endplug. The welding spots are smooth enough in order not to violate the drift tube outer diameter tolerances.

Metallurgical inspection of laser welds of the aluminum tubes on endplug aluminum alloys of series 2000 and 6000 showed the appearance of cracks in the melted welding spot both for point welds at the edge of the tube and through the tube wall. Such cracks are formed in the transition from liquid to solid state because the microcrystals formed are not soluble in the melted alloy. The absence of crack formation of this kind distinguishes 'weldable' from 'non-weldable' aluminum alloys.

Although so far no significant deterioration of the electrical conductivity of the laser welds on MDT tubes has been observed, improvements of the mechanical quality of the welds have been investigated and implemented by optimizing the materials and laser pulse parameters. We present a practical procedure for laser welding of the ground contacts during drift tube serial production and describe the experience after production and welding of 15% of the BOS drift tubes.

## 2 Aluminum Alloys

The alloy of the hard-drawn precision aluminum tubes, AlMn1 (3103), is insensitive to the formation of cracks during welding and therefore well suited for laser welding. In contrast, with the use of aluminum alloys of series 2000 and 6000 for the endplug reference ring (well suited for high-speed automated machining) cracks in the welding joints can hardly be avoided. Such alloys, e.g. AlCuBiPb (2011) and AlMgSiPb (6012) which are readily available in bar shape, contain lead and copper in order to reduce the chip size in high-speed automated machining. It is well known that these additions significantly compromise the weldability of the alloy. Series 2000 alloys, in particular, are considered unsuitable for welding.

Reliable welding joints can be achieved with alloys close to an eutectic mixture, e.g. AlSi alloy with 11.5% silicon. For this reason, AlSi10 is used as filler material for aluminum welding. AlMg4.5Mn (5083) and AlMgSi1 are best suited as endplug materials with respect to laser welding. These alloys are available in bar shape for use in automated machining.

Even for weld able aluminum alloys, the use of filler material is necessary in order to achieve reliable spot welds without cracks in a reproducible manner, especially when welding lasers have to be used which are affordable for institutes in the MDT collaboration.

Laser welding through the aluminum tube to the endplug aluminum ring is not recommended. For this case, previous tests at MPI have always shown cracks in the metallurgical inspection. In addition, this method does not allow for visual inspection of the quality of the welding contact.

## 3 Welding Tests

Extensive investigations of procedures for reliable laser spot welding of aluminum tubes on endplugs in realistic geometry have been performed in collaboration between MPI and the Metallurgical Institute of the University of Bayreuth, Germany.

The following test program has been performed:

* Optimization of the laser beam parameters taking into account the limitations of welding lasers affordable to the MDT collaboration.
* Quality of welding contacts with and without filler material (0.8 mm diameter AlSi10 filler wire which is commercially available).
* Investigation of different aluminum alloys for the endplug reference ring: 1. AlMg4.5Mn (5083), recommended for best welding quality. 2. AlMgSi1, also a weldable alloy which was used for the laser welded MPI tubes in the BML 98 prototype chamber. 3. AlMgSiPb (6012), suitable for high-speed automated machining. 4. AlCuBiPb (2011), suitable for high-speed automated machining and used for the endplug preseries from IHEP Protvino.

The quality of the welds has been evaluated using metallurgical cuts done at the University of Bayreuth. The quality criteria are: good metallic contacts between tube, endplug reference ring and filler material (if any) and the absence of cracks.

The tests showed that the laser pulses should have a rather long duration in order to achieve good metallic contacts and to avoid the formation of cracks due to different cooling and shrinkage speed of the aluminum ring and the small welding spot. For the better weldable alloys, the requirements on the laser pulse duration and shape are less critical. All endplug alloys have been tested with the same laser beam parameters including the maximum pulse length of 20 ms achievable with low-end welding lasers. For all alloys, the quality of the welds improves with the use of filler material. For the comparison of the different alloys, filler material has been used.

The quality requirements could only be satisfied using alloys no. 1 or 2 for the endplug in combination with filler wire. With alloy no. 1, very good metallurgical quality of the weld was achieved in this configuration (see Figure 3). Without filler material, comparable quality could not be obtained. Alloy no. 2 shows mechanically less strong welding contacts than alloy no. 1 (see Figure 4).

For alloy no. 3, the welding strength at the interfaces becomes rather marginal and small cracks appear in the melted filler material (see Figures 5 and 6). With alloy no. 4, reliable welds could not be produced; they break at the interface between filler material and endplug during cutting for metallurgical inspection which was not the case for the other alloys. With this alloy, cracks in the welding spot could also not be avoided. Even with much longer laser pulses (requiring top-end welding lasers available at the University of Bayreuth which exceed by far the financial limitations for MDT drift tube production) no reliable welds could be produced.

The welding tests lead to the conclusion to use AlMg4.5Mn (5083) alloy for the endplug reference ring. In addition it is welded to the tube end in 3 spots around the circumference AlSi10 wire of 0.8 mm diameter and \(2-2.5\) mm length is used as filler material. The optimized laser parameters are given below.

## 4 Welding Laser

The laser beam parameters have been optimized in a series of welding tests. The following parameters are recommended:

* Laser wave length: 1064 nm.
* Laser spot diameter at focus (FWHM): \(0.7-1\) mm, covering the full thickness of the filler wire. The laser spot size is adapted to the endplug and drift tube geometry. It allows for minimum effort to adjust the beam with respect to the tube. The shape of the spot is not important; therefore an optical fiber light output is not needed.
* Laser pulse length: single pulse of \(20-50\) ms duration. \(20\) ms is the upper limit for most low-end welding lasers and proofed to be sufficient. This pulse length was also used for the test welds shown in Figures 3-5. Welding lasers with up to \(50\) ms long pulses in the same price range are just now becoming available. Such a laser (see Figure 7) with a pulse length of \(50\) ms is used for the welding of the drift tubes for the BOS chambers at MPI. Longer pulses reduce the risk of cracks in the welding spot due to too fast cooling.
* Laser pulse energy: 32 J during the first \(20\) ms plus additional \(30\) ms decay time.
* Corresponding laser pulse power: \(1.5\) kW in the first \(20\) ms.
* Depth of focus from the top of the filler material: \(0.5\) mm.
* Vertical incidence of the laser beam on the welded tube end.
* Protection with inert gas.

A commercial laser system meeting all requirements is shown in Figure 7. The welding is performed inside the completely closed housing containing the tube holder and inert gas and is controlled via the video camera and monitor such that all safety requirements are met.

The infrared laser beam is adjusted with the help of a visible guiding laser using a video camera integrated in the collimator optics and cross wires displayed on a monitor (see Figure 8).

Endplug Geometry

In order to make the laser welding procedure of the drift tubes as robust as possible for serial production, the shape of the crimp groove on the endplug reference ring has been modified (see Figure 9):

The 1.2 mm deep crimp groove contains safely the 0.8 mm diameter filer wire with an additional step between the end of the reference surface and the bottom of the groove to protect the precision surface during welding. The ends of the aluminum tube are retracted from the edge of the reference surface on both endplug by 1.4 mm. The slope of the crimp groove is 11.3\({}^{\circ}\).

## 6 Laser Welding Process for Serial Production

The laser welding of the drift tube ground contact is performed at a dedicated station near the MDT chamber assembly room (see Figure 10). The support for the drift tubes inside the housing of the laser station is shown in Figure 11. The tube is inclined by 15\({}^{\circ}\) such that the inserted filler wire stays in place at the aluminum tube end during the laser shot. The tube ends are positioned on the supports in longitudinal and azimutal direction using an injection moulded clocking piece mounted on one tube end which is also used for the X-ray measurement of the tubes and for the positioning on the assembly combs (see Figure 12).

The welding procedure is the following for each drift tube:

1. Insertion of tube end into the support inside the protected welding chamber flushed with inert gas.
2. Placement of filler wire on the endplug reference ring at the tube end.
3. Verification of the laser beam adjustment on the monitor such that tube end and filler wire are covered by the laser spot but not the endplug reference surface.
4. Release of the programmed laser pulse.
5. Visual inspection of the correct location and quality of the welding spot on the monitor (see Figure 8).
6. Three welding spots are produced at each tube end in azimutal positions away from the glue gaps between tube layers separated by 120\({}^{\circ}\).

Three welding spots on each endplug are sufficient to guarantee reliable mechanical and electrical contact between tube and endplugs with the above procedure (see Figure 13).

The BOS drift tubes are routinely welded at MPI by technicians after a short training period of about one hour. On average, 60 tubes are being welded per day. None of the 6000 tubes welded so far had to be rejected after welding.

## 7 Accelerated Aging Test

Using the method and endplug aluminum alloy described above, 11 aluminum tubes of 20 cm length with dummy aluminum endplugs and 22 aluminum tubes of 20 cm length with standard endplugs have been laser welded and been exposed to a salt spray corrosion test over 48 hoursaccording to ISO 9227-NSS standard. The electrical resistance between the aluminum rings of the two endplugs has been determined before and after the accelerated aging of the laser welds by measuring the voltage drop along the tubes at constant low current of \(5-10\) mA (see Figure 14).

The results of the measurements are summarized in Table 1. The resistances of all test tubes are below \(1\) m\(\Omega\) before aging. After aging, the resistances of all but three test tubes are below \(1\) m\(\Omega\), unchanged within the measurement errors. The three exceptions showed a resistance below \(5\) m\(\Omega\) after aging. The measurement errors are estimated to be \(\pm 0.2\) m\(\Omega\) from measurements of the reproducibility of the electrical contacts to the endplugs. The resistance of the laser welded ground contacts corresponds to a solid metallic connection and is unaffected by the accelerated aging procedure.
