_LIP and Univ. Lisbon, Portugal_Introduction

Until 1997, all the fibres used in the TILECAL prototypes were mirror aluminized in the opposite end to the readout side. This operation was performed always in the Swiss enterprise Precitrame, with the _Magnetron Sputtering_ technique [1]. Before the aluminization, the fibres are cut and then polished in the Swiss enterprise Gebex.

Bicron fibres were used to re-equip half of the Module 0 in 1998, the aluminization of these fibres was performed in Precitrame as in the previous years. The S250 Pol.Hi.Tech fibres were used to re-equip the other half of the Module 0, the aluminization was performed in an Italian enterprise by Cold Plasma Technique in a high vacuum environment.

This note reports on:

* The quality control of the Kuraray Y11(200)MS fibres for the 1997 Extended Barrel Module 0, table 1, performed in April 1997. The light output and effective attenuation length were measured, as well as the fibre to fibre fluctuations. To half of the fibres of each length, the aluminium was taken out and this end was painted black. The reflection coefficient and attenuation length were measured.
* Measurement of fibres produced and aluminized between 1994 and 1996 for the Tilecal prototypes and Module 0. Only the reflection coefficient of the aluminium mirror was measured. Table 2 gives a list of these fibres. The tests were performed in March 1998.
* The quality control of Bicron fibres for half of the Module 0 in 1998 and the measurement of a few samples of Pol.Hi.Tech fibres, table 3. The optical properties of the 1998 fibres are reported in another note [3]. The tests were performed in June 1998.

## 2 Determination of the reflection coefficient

For the determination of the reflection coefficient the following approach was taken. It is assumed that the light output as a function of distance to the PM is well parametrised by a single exponential function for distances higher than \(\sim\)70 cm. In this way the light output of the fibre without aluminium and painted black (\(I_{\mathit{n}\mathit{a}\mathit{l}}(x)\)) is given by:

\[I_{\mathit{n}\mathit{a}\mathit{l}}\left(x\right)=I_{0}\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{ \mathit{a}\mathit{t}\mathit{t}\mathit{t}}}\right) \tag{1}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Fibre Type & Fibre length (cm) & \# fibres \\ \hline BCF99-28 K MC & 220 & 5 \\ BCF99-28 K MC & 230 & 11 \\ \hline BCF91A MC & 120 & 6 \\ BCF91A MC & 140 & 10 \\ BCF91A MC & 150 & 13 \\ BCF91A MC & 165 & 10 \\ BCF91A MC & 200 & 9 \\ BCF91A MC & 210 & 16 \\ \hline S250 Poly. coat & 115 & 3 \\ S250 Poly. coat & 130 & 1 \\ S250 Poly. coat & 190 & 3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}
Table 2: List of the samples of fibres from the 1994 to 1996 production, for which the reflection coefficient was measured.

For \(x>70cm\). The light output of the mirror aluminized fibre (\(I_{a1}(x)\)) can be parametrised by the same function plus reflection, given by:

\[I_{a1}(x)=I_{0}\left[\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{att}}\right)+R\exp\left(-\frac{2l-x} {L_{att}}\right)\right] \tag{2}\]

\(R\) is the reflection coefficient and \(l\) is the length of the fibre. The ratio of equation 2 by 1 gives:

\[\frac{I_{a1}(x)}{I_{a1}(x)}=\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{att}}\right)+R\exp \left(-\frac{2l-x}{L_{att}}\right)}{\exp\left(-\frac{x}{L_{att}}\right)} \tag{3}\]

\[\frac{I_{a1}(x)}{I_{a1}(x)}-1=R\exp\left(-2\frac{l-x}{L_{att}}\right) \tag{4}\]

The attenuation length \(L_{att}\) is determined first from eq. 1 for each fibre, and inserted in eq. 4. In this way the reflection coefficient \(R\) is the average of \(R_{i}\), for each pair of values of \(\left(x_{i},\left(\frac{I_{a1}}{I_{a1}}\right)_{i}\right)\).

## 3 1997 Extended Barrel Module 0 fibres

### Aluminized fibres

For the aluminized fibres the following parameters were taken:

* Effective attenuation length \(L_{eff}\) for \(x\in[70,l-10]cm\), (\(l\) is the length of the fibre), taken from a single exponential fit.
* The light output at \(x=130cm\), \(I(130)\).
* The light output at \(x=180cm\), \(I(180)\), for fibres with \(l\geq 190\) cm

In table 4 it is presented the average and \(RMS\) of these parameters for each length. Figs. 1 and 2, show the light output \(I(x)\) of 10 fibres as a function of distance to the PMT, for 250 cm and 190 cm length fibres respectively.

The light output \(I(130)\) decreases when the fibre length increase, this is due to the fact that the mirror is closer to the PMT for shorter fibres. As expected this also occurs for \(I(180)\), for the fibres with \(190\) cm length and higher. The fibre to fibre fluctuations in the light output are in general \(2\%\) or less. For the \(235\) cm fibres and \(250\) cm fibres without polymer, the fluctuations are \(\sim 4\%\). On the other hand the higher fluctuation (\(\sim 2.5\%\)) for the \(190\) cm fibres is due to one fibre that is below the others, fig. 2.

It can be seen that the _"effective"_ attenuation length \(L_{eff}\) (for \(x>70\) cm) of the aluminized fibres, decreases from \(10.9\) m for \(140\) cm fibres to \(5.5\) m for \(250\) cm fibres, and the fibre to fibre fluctuations also decreases from \(\sim 15\%\) for the shorter fibres to \(\sim 4\%\) or less for the longer fibres. This can be explained by the following facts:

* Since the fit is taken for \(x>70\) cm until the _"end"_ of the fibre, the region of the fit increases with the fibre length, and the mirror is at a longer distance from the readout, decreasing the light output at the same distance. Fig. 3 shows for each fibre length, the average of light output as a function of distance to the PMT.
* Concerning fibre to fibre fluctuations, when the _effective_ attenuation length is very high (as is the case for \(140\) cm and \(165\) cm fibres, \(L_{eff}>9\)\(m\)), very small fluctuations in the light output induce high fluctuations in the _effective_ attenuation length.

### Fibres without aluminium mirror

The reflection coefficient of the mirror aluminium is calculated with eq.4. Table 5 shows the results obtained for the reflection coefficient and attenuation length taken from one exponential fit between \(70\) cm and \((l-10\) cm), where \(l\) is the length of the fibre.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Fibre & Number of & \(L_{eff}\) (cm) & \(I(130)\) & \(I(180)\) \\ length (cm) & fibres & \(x>70cm\) & & \\ \hline \(140\) & \(10\) & \(1088\) (\(14.6\%\) ) & \(0.815\) (\(1.8\%\) ) & **–** \\ \hline \(165\) & \(10\) & \(919\) (\(9.8\%\) ) & \(0.783\) (\(1.6\%\) ) & **–** \\ \hline \(190\) & \(10\) & \(652\) (\(4.5\%\) ) & \(0.735\) (\(2.3\%\) ) & \(0.682\) (\(2.5\%\) ) \\ \hline \(235\) & \(10\) & \(580\) (\(4.9\%\) ) & \(0.710\) (\(3.7\%\) ) & \(0.647\) (\(3.7\%\) ) \\ \hline \(250\) & \(10\) & \(562\) (\(3.8\%\) ) & \(0.677\) (\(1.3\%\) ) & \(0.608\) (\(1.3\%\) ) \\ \hline \(250\) (no polym) & \(10\) & \(549\) (\(2.5\%\) ) & \(0.680\) (\(4.0\%\) ) & \(0.610\) (\(4.2\%\) ) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

It can be seen that the reflection coefficient measured soon after the aluminization is approximately the same as the one measured in March 98. The fibres with polymer and without polymer from the 1996 batch give about the same reflection coefficient. The fibres which were taken out of the Barrel Module 0, were rather curved making it difficult to be measured in our setup, this difficulty is easily overcome by cutting the fibres to 25 cm length. To ensure that this procedure would not bias the results, two samples of fibres were also cut to 25 cm and compared with the 155 cm length fibres from the same samples. As can be seen, both the 95 samples and 96 samples give the same reflection coefficient within fluctuations. All the 96 samples present a similar reflection coefficient of the order of 77% and in rather good agreement with that obtained in TILECAL note 89 [6], of 75%.

## 5 Fibres to re-equip the 1998 Module 0

A large sample of Bicron fibres (80) to re-equip half of the Module 0 in 1998 were measured. In this way fibre to fibre fluctuations in the light output and reflection coefficients were tested. For each length of fibres, the attenuation length of the fibres without aluminium mirror was taken.

In the case of the Pol.Hi.Tech fibres, the same study was done except the fibre to fibre fluctuations due to the small samples of fibres tested. The S250 fibres were inserted and glued to the profiles, in this way the profiles were cut around the small part which was glued to the fibre.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline Fibre & Length & \# & \(R\pm RMS\) (\%) & \(R\) (\%) \\  & (cm) & fibres & March 98 & past \\ \hline Y11 (Prot. 94) & 110 & 8 & 61.2 \(\pm\) 3.4 & 60 [4] \\ \hline Y11 (Prot. 95) & 155 & 8 & 55.8 \(\pm\) 4.7 & 50 [5] \\ Y11 (Prot. 95) & 25 & 7 & 52.8 \(\pm\) 6.7 & – \\ \hline Y11 (BM0 96) with polymer & 155 & 8 & 77.1 \(\pm\) 2.4 & 75 [6] \\ Y11 (BM0 96) with polymer & 25 & 8 & 77.9 \(\pm\) 1.6 & – \\ Y11 (BM0 96) no polymer & 155 & 4 & 76.1 \(\pm\) 2.4 & – \\ Y11 t taken from BM0 96 with pol. & 25 & 5 & 76.8 \(\pm\) 3.3 & – \\ \hline Y11(300)MS STIC calor. 96 & 52 & 32 & 81.2 \(\pm\) 7.5 & 80 [7] \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Aluminized fibres

Table 7 shows the type, length, number of fibres and the light output at 130 cm and 180 cm for the Bicron fibres. In parenthesis it is shown the fibre to fibre fluctuations in the light output. It is seen that, except for the 120 cm fibres, the fluctuations range between 2.2 and 5%, fig 6 shows the 16 BCF91A MC fibres with 210 cm length. This can be compared with the fluctuations measured in section 3 for the EBM0 Y11(200)MS fibres, which were of the order of 2% or less, fig. 1.

The light output at 110, 130 and 180 cm of the aluminized Pol.Hi.Tech fibres, is given in table 8. Comparing the light output of S250 and Bicron fibres of about the same length, it is seen that for 115/120 cm fibres the light output at 110 cm (\(I\) (110)) of the S250 fibres is about 30% lower than the BCF91A MC fibres, and the 190 cm S250 fibres have \(I\) (180) about 20% lower than the 200 cm BCF91A MC fibres. Fig 7 shows the light output \(I(x)\) as a function of distance \((x)\) to the PMT, for S250 and some BCF91A MC aluminized fibres.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Fibre & Fibre & Number of & \(I\)(130) & \(I\)(180) \\ Type & length (cm) & fibres & & \\ \hline BCF 99-28 K MC & 220 & 5 & 0.663 (4.7\% ) & 0.600 (3.8\% ) \\ BCF 99-28 K MC & 230 & 11 & 0.671 (4.8\% ) & 0.605 (4.8\% ) \\ \hline BCF91A MC & 140 & 10 & 0.927 (2.6\% ) & — \\ BCF91A MC & 150 & 13 & 0.854 (3.7\% ) & — \\ BCF91A MC & 165 & 10 & 0.821 (2.2\% ) & — \\ BCF91A MC & 200 & 9 & 0.757 (3.2\% ) & 0.696 (4.2\% ) \\ BCF91A MC & 210 & 16 & 0.715 (4.8\% ) & 0.655 (5.5\% ) \\ \hline  & & & \(I\)(110) & \\ \hline BCF91A MC & 120 & 6 & 1.007 (1.5\% ) & — \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Fibres without aluminium mirror

The aluminium mirror was taken out of about half of the Bicron fibres listed in table 3, and to all the S250 fibres. The fibres were painted black on this side (opposite to the readout PMT).

As in section 3.2, the reflection coefficient is calculated through eq. 4. A fit with 1 exponential between 70 cm and \(l-10\) cm to the light output of the fibres painted black, is performed to evaluate the attenuation length, which is then inserted in eq. 4.

Table 9 shows the fibre length, number of fibres, the reflection coefficient and attenuation length (\(70<x<l-10\)) for each sample of fibres, the \(RMS\) in \(R\) and \(L_{att}\) is also shown. It can be seen that the Bicron fibres aluminized by the sputtering technique present an average reflection coefficient of about 72%, while the S250 fibres aluminized by Cold Plasma technique present a much lower value of about 38%. It is seen that the \(RMS\) in attenuation length of the Bicron fibres is in general about 20-30 cm (except in a few samples), to be compared with about 5 cm or less \(RMS\), presented in table 5 for the Y11(200)MS fibres.

Fig. 8 shows the light output as function of distance to the PMT for the S250 and some BCF91A MC fibres without aluminium. As can be seen both type of fibres have similar light output.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline Fibre & Length & \# & \(R\pm RMS\) & \(L_{att}\) \\  & (cm) & fibres & (\%) & (cm) \\ \hline BCF99-28 K MC & 220 & 3 & 67.5 \(\pm\) 5.1 & 245 \(\pm\) 2 \\ BCF99-28 K MC & 230 & 5 & 75.0 \(\pm\) 8.0 & 256 \(\pm\) 17 \\

Conclusions

The quality control of Y11(200)MS fibres for the Extended Barrel Module 0 in 1997 was performed. Fibre to fibre fluctuations in the light output of aluminized fibres are of the order of 2% or less. The attenuation length of Y11(200)MS fibres without aluminium is of the order of 270-280 cm with a dispersion of 5 cm or less.

Samples of aluminized fibres produced between 1994 and 1996 to equip the several TILECAL prototypes and modules were measured. The quality of the aluminization achieved since 1996, as proven to be satisfactory and no decrease of the reflection coefficient was observed, (see [8]). Reflection coefficients of the order of 75% or higher are thus obtained with aluminization done by the _Magnetron__Sputtering_ technique.

The quality control of Bicron fibres to re-equip half of the Module 0 in 1998 was performed. Fibre to fibre fluctuations in the light output of aluminized Bicron fibres between 2 and 5% were found. The attenuation length of BCF 99-28 K MC fibres was measured to be about 250 cm (220-230 cm length fibres), while for the BCF91A MC fibres the attenuation length is of the order of 280-290 cm with fluctuations of the order of 20 cm.

The reflection coefficient of the Bicron fibres is on average 72%, aluminized (as in previous years) by the _Magnetron__Sputtering_ technique, while the aluminization performed by the Italian enterprise to the Pol.Hi.Tech S250 fibres present a lower reflection coefficient of the order of 38%.

The 20-30% lower light output measured on the S250 aluminized fibres compared with the BCF91A MC fibres is due to the difference in quality of the aluminizations, since the S250 and BCF 91A MC fibres without aluminium present similar light output.
