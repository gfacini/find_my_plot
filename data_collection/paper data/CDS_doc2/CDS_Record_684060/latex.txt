Introduction

Simulations of B-physics events are divided into particle level simulations, simulations of detector response, fast simulations and dedicated simulations for some of the B-hadron decays.

About 1.8 million events were simulated with PYTHIA 5.7 and JETSET 7.4 [1]. This step, the so-called particle level simulation (PL), contains the whole chain of processes, starting with single proton-proton collision and ending with hadron decays, and also including weak decays of beauty, charm and neutral strange hyperons. All events written on the output tapes satisfy the first level trigger condition, that is, the presence of at least one muon with \(p_{\rm\,T}\ >\ 6\ {\rm GeV}\) and \(|\eta|\ <2.4\). About \(25\%\) of the particle level events were processed with the detector simulation program DICE [2] based on GEANT 3. Background events which are rejected by extremely large factors in the analyses were simulated using a fast Monte Carlo simulation program [3]. This includes a parametrization of the detector performance which was tuned to reproduce the results from the reconstruction of fully simulated events in the inner detector [4]. Multiple proton-proton collisions originating from the same bunch crossing were simulated by combining hits from the inner detector simulation of one beauty event and of several unbiased events.

The paper is divided into two parts. The first part (chapters 2 to 4) contains an explanation of the simulation methods and of the choice of parameters for particle level and detector Monte Carlo programs. Also the physics requirements and the types of data samples are described. The essential numerical information is presented in the second part (Appendix) in a compressed form. It also contains cross sections of selected processes, the list of all simulated processes and the tapes, the table of B-hadron masses and lifetimes used, details of inclusive \(b\overline{b}\to{\rm J}/\psi\) sample and a full list of data cards for PYTHIA and GEANT.

### Methods of beauty production simulations

The theoretical aspects which underly the particle level simulations were described in detail in a separate ATLAS note [5]. The explanation given here repeats the basic arguments to motivate the selection of the parameters for the simulations.

Hadronic production of heavy flavours and, in particular, the production of beauty quarks may be reasonably described within perturbative quantum chromodynamics. Although considerable progress has been achieved in calculating the full next-to-leading order (NLO) matrix elements within perturbative QCD [6, 7] it seems that the \(O(\alpha_{s}^{2})\) and \(O(\alpha_{s}^{3})\) contributions do not exhaust all the visible effects. At present, there seems to be room for higher order corrections. The latter cannot be calculated easily. However, their role may, probably, be understood on a phenomenological level in terms of additional production mechanisms. In PYTHIA the following three mechanisms contribute to the production of beauty particles: flavour creation, flavour excitation and gluon splitting.

#### 3.1.1 Pythia

The three beauty production mechanisms mentioned are activated in PYTHIA by choosing the minimum bias option MSEL=1, or, equivalently, the full user control option MSEL=0 followed by explicit statements MSUB(ll)=1, MSUB(ll)=1, MSUB(ll)=1, MSUB(28)=1, MSUB(53)=1, MSUB(68)=1. These statements switch on the following partonic subprocesses: \(q_{i}q_{j}\to q_{i}q_{j}\), \(q_{i}\bar{q}_{i}\to q_{i}\bar{q}_{k}\), \(q_{i}\bar{q}_{i}\to gg\), \(q_{i}g\to q_{i}g\), \(gg\to q_{k}q_{\overline{k}}\), \(gg\to gg\). In particular, the direct production mechanisms \(qq\to\overline{b}b\) and \(gg\to\overline{b}b\) are included in MSUB(ll) and MSUB(53), respectively, and the flavour excitation \(g\,b\to gb\) is contained in MSUB(28). In addition, all the above subprocesses can initiate parton showers (by default, MSTP(61)=1 and MSTP(71)=1 for initial and final state radiation, respectively), in which \(b\)-quarks may appear as a result of gluon splitting. By default, we also assume the possibility for multiple parton interactions (when several pairs of partons from the colliding protons interact independently in the same event): MSTP(81)=1.

The most significant theoretical uncertainties, which affect the size of the production cross section are related to the choice of the factorization and renormalization scales \(\mu_{F}\) and \(\mu_{R}\) and to the quark mass value \(m_{b}\). The factorization scale \(\mu_{F}\) is relevant for the evaluation of the parton distribution functions, and the renormalization scale \(\mu_{R}\) determines the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}(\mu_{R}/\Lambda_{\;QCD})\). We have adopted PYTHIA's default conventions and values: \(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=Q_{\mbox{hard}}^{2}=(m_{T}^{(1)}+m_{T}^{(2)})/2\) (MSTP(32)=2), where \(m_{T}^{(i)}\) are the transverse masses of the partons originating from the hard subprocess, and \(m_{b}=5.0\) GeV (PMAS(5,1)=5.0). The maximal virtuality of the partons appearing in the initial and final state showers (i.e., the available phase space for the showers) is taken to be \(Q_{\mbox{max}}^{2}=4Q_{\mbox{hard}}^{2}\), which is the default definition.

With the above set of parameters PYTHIA can reproduce the Tevatron data on the inclusive B-hadron distributions both in shape and the absolute normalization [5, 8].

To make the generation of \(b\)-quarks more efficient, we apply the following kinematic constraints on the hard partonic subprocess: CKIN(3)=10.0 (lower limit for the \(p_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\) range), CKIN(9)=-3.5, CKIN(10)=3.5 (lower and upper limits for the rapidity range of the first parton), CKIN(ll)=-3.5, CKIN(12)=3.5 (lower and upper limits for the rapidity range of the second parton). A comparison of the loss of \(b\bar{b}\) events due to the cuts CKIN(3)=10.0 and CKIN(3)=6.0 is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the trigger muon transverse momentum \(p_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\)\((\mu)\). At the lowest \(p_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\)\((\mu)\) the difference does not exceed 30%, and it vanishes at \(p_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\)\((\mu)\)\(\simeq 10\) GeV.

Figure 1: The differential cross sections \(d\,\sigma/d\,p_{\rm T}\) of \(b\ \overline{b}\ \rightarrow\mu{\rm X}\) as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\) of muon (maximum of the two normalized to 1) for two cuts on \(p_{\rm T}\ _{{}_{\rm HARD}}\). Full line corresponds to \(p_{\rm T}\ _{{}_{\rm HARD}}>6\ {\rm GeV}\), dashed line to \(p_{\rm T}\ _{{}_{\rm HARD}}>10\ {\rm GeV}\).

#### 3.1.2 MNR code

As an alternative approach, we use the MNR code [7] based on the explicit LO\(+\)NLO matrix elements for the production of beauty quarks. This code is equipped with the \(b\)-quark fragmentation algorithm (Peterson fragmentation function [9]) and with routines simulating semileptonic decays of \(B\)-hadrons (based on the \(V-A\) matrix elements). The accompanying particles are not taken into consideration. The most significant theoretical uncertainties are related to the same parameters as in PYTHIA, that is, to the factorization and the renormalization scales \(\mu_{F}\) and \(\mu_{R}\), and the quark mass \(m_{b}\).

Note that this code cannot be used as an event generator because it may produce negative event weights due to the interference between the tree and one-loop amplitudes in the \(2\to 2\) subprocesses, \(gg\to b\overline{b}\) and \(q\overline{q}\to b\overline{b}\). Physically, these negative contributions are exactly compensated by positive contributions from collinear gluon radiation, \(gg\to b\overline{b}g\) or \(q\overline{q}\to b\overline{b}g\). However, the latter is formally considered in the code as a different, \(2\to 3\), subprocess. The code may be fruitfully used to calculate various kinds of inclusive \(B\)-hadron spectra or \(B\)-\(\bar{B}\) correlations, where the positive and negative weights cancel each other at the histogram level.

In ATLAS simulations, this code was used only for the determination of muon spectra from semileptonic B-hadron decays.

### Parton distribution functions and multiple parton interactions

The sensitivity of the predicted \(B\) production cross sections to the choice of parton distribution functions (PDF) is negligible (provided the PDFs are taken from post-HERA sets), because the relevant \(x\) range (see Fig. 2) lies entirely in the domain covered by HERA, \(10^{-4}<x<0.1\), where all modern PDF parametrizations are very close to each other. We have adopted PYTHIA's default set, CTEQ2L [10] (MSTP(51)=9). Variations in the \(b\)-quark production cross section due to different chosen PDF, even including the obsolete EHLQ [11] set (which has been used as default in old ATLAS simulations1), do not exceed 15% (Fig. 3). The largest changes (up to 75% ) concern the flavour excitation subprocess, because the beauty sea is the most poorly known and greatly fluctuates from one structure function.

Footnote 1: These simulations were done before the year 1995, and are not included in the present note

The predicted overall particle multiplicities (both in minimum bias events and in events containing \(b\)-quarks) are, however, sensitive to the choice of PDF [12]. The \(p_{\,\mathrm{T}}\) spectra of non-beauty particles also posses such a sensitivity. The reason is that PYTHIA takes into account multiple parton interactions, with the probability that \(n\) parton pairs interact independently being proportional to the product of PDF raised to this power (at LHC energies, \(n\simeq 1\,2\)). A dedicated study of multiple parton interaction models may be found elsewhere [12].

### Hadronization

At the hadronization step, the produced \(b\)-quarks are converted into \(B\) hadrons using the Peterson fragmentation function (MSTJ(ll)=3) with the corresponding parameter \(\epsilon_{b}=0.006\) (PARJ(55)=-0.006). The available experimental data on the \(b\)-quark fragmentation properties are yet inconclusive and allow a relatively wide range: \(0.002<\epsilon_{b}<0.006\). The largest value of \(\epsilon_{b}\) leads to the softest \(B\)-hadron spectra, thus providing the lowest (most pessimistic) estimate for the \(B\)-hadron detection rates.

### Decays in PYTHIA

PYTHIA contains an explicit list of all hadronic two-body decay channels, while the hadronic channels with three or more particles are only given in terms of a quark content, in the framework of pure'spectator quark' model. The \(B_{c}\) is an exception: either the bottom or the charm quark decays first, and annihilation

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

Horizontal axis shows the value of the lower limit of the integration over muon \(p_{\rm T}\). **(a)** all production mechanisms summed together; **(b)** various production mechanisms shown separately: full curve â€“ flavour excitation \(g+b\to g+b\), dashed curve â€“ gluon gluon fusion \(g+g\to b+\overline{b}\), dotted curve â€“ gluon gluon scattering followed by gluon splitting \(g+g\to g+g\), \(g\to b+\overline{b}\).

graphs may be non-negligible. Leptonic and semileptonic channels are here given in full, while hadronic channels are again listed in terms of a quark content, with a relative composition as given in [13].

In semileptonic decays and in most multibody hadronic decays, e.g. \(b\to cd\,\!\bar{u}\), the \(c\)-quark is combined with the spectator flavour to form one single hadron, and thereafter the hadron and the two quark (or lepton) momenta are distributed according to the \(V-A\) matrix element. The invariant mass of the two quarks is calculated next. If this mass is so low that two hadrons cannot be formed from the system, the two quarks are combined into one single hadron. Otherwise, another kind of approach is adopted, wherein a multiplicity is selected, a number of hadrons are formed and thereafter momenta are distributed according to phase space.

The masses of the decay products have been neglected in the matrix element, but in the branching ratios the \(\tau\,\!\bar{\nu}_{\tau}\) channel has been reduced in rate, compared with \(e\bar{\nu}_{e}\) and \(\mu\,\!\bar{\nu}_{\mu}\) ones, according to the expected mass effects. No CKM-suppressed decays \(b\to u\,\!l\bar{\nu}_{l}\) are currently included.

In PYTHIA the \(B^{0}\) - \(\bar{B}^{0}\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\) - \(\bar{B}^{0}_{s}\) systems can mix before the decay. In our PYTHIA simulations mixing was not included.

### Inclusive decays \(b\,\!\overline{b}\ \to{\rm J}/\psi\ {\rm X}\)

In PYTHIA, all observed two-body decays containing \({\rm J}/\psi\) meson are explicitly listed for \({\rm B}^{0}\), \({\rm B}^{+}\), \({\rm B}^{0}_{s}\) and \(\Lambda^{0}_{b}\), with their branching ratios set to their measured values. Other sources of \(b\,\!\overline{b}\ \to{\rm J}/\psi\ {\rm X}\) are simulated according to the quark level decay \(b\to c\,\!s\bar{c}\) followed by the fragmentation process which converts quarks into hadrons. However, the latter decays give only a minor contribution (see Appendix C), and and do not sum up to the total branching fraction of the decay \(b\,\!\overline{b}\ \to{\rm J}/\psi\ {\rm X}\).

The channels with \({\rm J}/\psi\) constitute an important background to several CP violation channels. For this reason, we prepared a dedicated simulation of inclusive \(b\,\!\overline{b}\ \to{\rm J}/\psi\ {\rm X}\) decay by simply adding three-body and four-body decays. The approach used in this simulation was based on the idea that the energy left in the decaying beauty system after the creation of \({\rm J}/\psi\) meson is approximately the same as that released in the decay of charmed mesons. Also, in both situations the decay products contain one valence \(s\)-quark. Therefore, we have assumed that the particle contents should be similar (both in multiplicities and flavours) and used the data on charm meson decays. In addition, we used existing experimental data on few exclusive \({\rm J}/\psi\) channels, and the ideas of isospin symmetry. The details for each type of B-hadron and the full list of channels are given in Appendix C. We understand the limitations of this approach.

### Dedicated simulations of some specific decays

In certain analyses it was important to understand the decay amplitudes in more detail, including spin dependences (that is, the production and the decay polarization) and the role of higher order contributions (that is, for instance, penguin diagrams, mixing effects, etc.) or of the final state interactions. In particular this concerns the decays: \({\rm B}^{0}_{s}\ \to{\rm J}/\psi\,\phi\ \,\ {\rm B}^{0}_{s}\ \to{\rm D}_{s}\pi\,\ {\rm B}^{0}_{s}\ \to{\rm D}_{s}{\rm a}_{1}\,\ {\rm B}_{d}\to{\rm J}/\psi{\rm K}^{0}\ \,\ \Lambda^{0}_{b}\ \to\Lambda^{0}\ {\rm J}/\psi\ \,\)\({\rm B}_{d}\to\pi\,\pi\).

Many of these processes are only poorly known at present and various parametrizations are under consideration. This leads us to the solution of a dedicated Monte Carlo simulation (called toy simulation) which is done in a space of variables characterizing a B-hadron decay through a set of input parameters. Detector performance has been taken into account by smearing the variables according to functions deduced from detector simulations and reconstruction.

### Speeding-up the simulation of beauty events

Simulation of one \(b\overline{b}\) event with \(b\) or \(\overline{b}\) producing a muon satisfying the LVL1 trigger condition, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\ (\mu)>6\) GeV and \(|\eta(\mu)|<2.4\), takes \(\sim 40\,s\) on an HP735 2. Much of this time is spent for the creation of a \(b\overline{b}\) pair at the parton level, while hadronization and decay steps are significantly less time consuming. To speed-up the process, the hadronization step is repeated several (MHAD) times for every parton configuration. After the hadronization and decay steps, all events which pass the selection criteria are taken with equal weights (\(=1\)). The cross section given by PYTHIA then is renormalized by a correction factor 1/MHAD. With this method, events may appear that have the same partonic configuration and only differ in the hadronization or decay parts. The number of hadronization repetitions MHAD is always chosen such that the mean number of these events is not far from 1. This gives a reasonable time for the simulation of one event.

Footnote 2: all CPU times mentioned in this NOTE are given for HP735 with 160 MHz processor. This represents a typically used facility, however letâ€™s remark that the simulation was performed in many institutes on different computing facilities, that also had changed within the period 1996-99.

### Simulations of non-B-physics background processes

#### 3.8.1 Direct \(\mathrm{J/\psi}\) production at LHC

Our simulation has been performed in the framework of the Colour Octet Model [14] incorporated in PYTHIA. In this model the dominant contribution to charmonium production comes from gluon-gluon fusion, giving rise to a bound \(c\,\overline{c}\) pair, which may be either in a colour singlet or colour octet state. The latter evolves nonperturbatively into a charmonium state through the emission of soft gluons. The probabilities of these soft transitions, the so-called colour octet matrix elements, were adjusted to the Tevatron data [15] on \(\mathrm{J/\psi}\) and \(\psi^{{}^{\prime}}\) production. The simulated events with direct \(\mathrm{J/\psi}\) production written on the output tapes satisfied the first and second level trigger conditions, that is, the presence of at least one muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\ >6\ \mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|\ <2.4\) and other muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\ >3\ \mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|\ <2.5\).

#### 3.8.2 Minimum bias events

For minimum bias events, as for the events containing beauty quarks, the multiplicities of particles and their \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra are sensitive to the model of multiple parton interactions. For both these types of events we have used PYTHIA's default model and parameter values. The latter are settled in accordance with \(\mathrm{U\,A\,5}\) data [16]. As soon as new CDF data become available, this choice will be revised and updated. Preliminary analyses [12] indicate the necessity for certain refinements.

#### 3.8.3 Charm production

Charm production was done in full analogy with beauty production, with the only exception of a lower quark mass. Here, PYTHIA's default value has been adopted: PMAS(4,1)=1.35. Like in the case of beauty events, all charm events written on the output tapes satisfied the first level trigger condition, that is, the presence of at least one muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\ >6\ \mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|\ <2.4\).

Detector simulation

### Detector simulation requirements.

In several B-physics decays under consideration the secondary charged hadrons will be reconstructed down to momenta as low as \(p_{\rm T}~{}\sim\) 0.5 GeV (for instance channels \({\rm B_{\,d}}\rightarrow{\rm J}/\psi{\rm K^{0}}~{}\), \({\rm B^{0}_{\,s}}\rightarrow{\rm D_{\,s}}\pi~{}\), \({\rm B^{0}_{\,s}}\rightarrow{\rm D_{\,s}}\pi~{}\), \({\rm B^{0}_{\,s}}\rightarrow{\rm D_{\,s}}{\rm a_{1}}~{}\)). To understand the reconstruction efficiencies in these channels it is important to have a reliable simulation of hadron inelastic interactions with material of the inner detector down to \(p_{\rm T}~{}\sim\) 0.5 GeV where the B-signal statistics is dominant. This includes the resonance region \(p_{\rm T}~{}\sim\) 1 GeV where the cross sections increase. This simulation uses the program FLUKA [17] implemented in GEANT. It is based on the cross sections measured in the experiments with low \(p_{\rm T}\) beams summarized in the PDG [18]. Experimental errors of these measurements limit our determination of the reconstruction efficiency.

A typical time for the simulation of 1 event in the full detector was 15 minutes on an HP735 while it took only 1 minute in the inner detector. For this reason the channels for a full detector simulation were carefully chosen. Most of the simulations were done in the inner detector. The decision was made according to the types of secondary particles and their momenta.

Pure hadronic B-decays were simulated only in the inner detector as they do not require the rest of the detector for their reconstruction.

For channels containing electrons the decision was made according to the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the electron. Electrons from \(b\,\overline{b}~{}\rightarrow{\rm J}/\psi\rightarrow{\rm e^{+}e^{-}}~{}\) will be reconstructed down to momenta \(p_{\rm T}~{}\sim 0.5~{}{\rm GeV}\). This is approximately the minimal momentum that electrons should posses after passing through silicon detectors to be reconstructed in the TRT. For a particle identification of electrons with \(p_{\rm T}~{}<~{}2{\rm GeV}\) only the TRT was used, so most of the \(b\overline{b}\rightarrow{\rm J}/\psi~{}\rightarrow{\rm e^{+}e^{-}}~{}\) events were simulated only in the inner detector. The whole detector simulation was done for the inclusive events \(b\,\overline{b}~{}\rightarrow\mu\,eX\). In this case a combined inner detector and electromagnetic calorimeter analysis allowed the efficient identification of electrons with \(p_{\rm T}~{}>~{}5{\rm GeV}\). These electrons will be used for tagging the flavour of B-mesons.

Muons are expected to be identified for transverse momenta as low as 3 GeV. In the barrel region an energy deposition in the last hadronic sampling of TILECAL will be used for identification of muons with \(3~{}{\rm GeV}<p_{\rm T}~{}<~{}5~{}{\rm GeV}\)[19]. In the endcap the muon detector provides an identification for muons with \(p_{\rm T}~{}>~{}3~{}{\rm GeV}\).

For B-physics detector simulations we set all transport cuts to 100 keV and cuts for a production of secondaries to 1 MeV. This was taken for both the inner detector as well as for the rest of the detector.

### Inner detector simulation

All particles from PL events (simulated with PYTHIA) that had \(|\eta|<2.7\) were simulated in the inner detector. No \(\eta\) limit was required for secondary particles produced in GEANT.

The detector volume was limited by the radius \({\rm r_{\rm max}}=115~{}{\rm cm}\) and a \(z\) dimension \({\rm z_{\rm max}}=345~{}{\rm cm}\). With this limitation the back-splash from particle showers initiating at the front face of the EM calorimeter is ignored, but it has been shown [20] that it produces only a very small contribution to the occupancies in the inner detector.

Information about particles resulting from any type of interactions inside the inner detector was stored in the KINE bank, if the incident particle's energy was above 300 MeV, or 10 MeV for Bremsstrahlung. No energy limit (concerning the storage in KINE) was imposed on the secondaries themselves.

B-hadrons and their secondaries were decayed in PYTHIA, including hyperons \({\rm K^{0}_{\,s}}\) and \(\Lambda^{0}~{}\). The probability that \({\rm K^{0}_{\,s}}\) or \(\Lambda^{0}~{}\)will interact within the radial distance \(1-42~{}{\rm cm}\) was simulated with DICE [21] and was shown to be negligible (\(0.5\%\)). This radial distance was chosen for decay vertices of accepted \({\rm K^{0}_{\,s}}\) and \(\Lambda^{0}~{}\)candidates, coming form B-decays. PYTHIA decays were done for any \({\rm K^{0}_{\,s}}\) and \(\Lambda^{0}~{}\)in the event (not only for those coming from the B-hadron signal chain). This leads to a slight underestimation of the number of secondary hadrons produced in inelastic \(\rm K^{0}_{s}\) or \(\rm\Lambda^{0}\) reactions and consequently of the number of muons from \(\rm K^{\,\pm},\pi^{\,\pm}\) decays in flight.

A dedicated simulation of events with decay-in-flight muons is described in the next section.

Versions DICE96-12, DICE97-6 and DICE98-2 were used for the inner detector simulation in the period of 1996-99. Events from versions DICE97-6 and DICE98-2 were combined in event analyses. The full list of DICE datacards is given in Appendix F1.

#### 4.2.1 B-events with pile-up

At the LHC luminosity of \(10^{33}\rm cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) a B-event is expected to be accompanied on average by approximately three minimum bias events coming from the same bunch crossing. This is true not only for B-events but for any event with a cross section negligible compared to the total inelastic cross section. Therefore, it affects also B-physics background processes like charm, direct \(\rm J/\psi\) production or those minimum bias events that switch the LVL1 trigger by a muon from \(\rm K^{\pm},\pi^{\,\pm}\) decays in flight.

Pile-up events were merged with B-events at the level of hits in the inner detector. The mean values of pile-up events at SCT was 2.4 and at TRT 3.2.

### Whole detector simulation

A whole detector simulation for B-physics started with DICE321 released in October 1998. For B-physics simulations we used the version in which the information about muon kinematics is stored also at the entrance and the exit of the muon detector volume. In this case, the muon has the track number of the primary muon stored in UBUF(5), labelling that it is not a new muon.

The kinematics is also stored for all secondary particles coming from decays in the whole volume of the ATLAS detector. This was done mainly to understand sources of background in the muon detector. The events in which \(\rm K^{\,\pm},\pi^{\,\pm}\) decays to muons with \(\rm p_{T}\,>\,6\,\,GeV\) are, however, rare, and therefore a dedicated simulation was done.

All particles from PL events (simulated with PYTHIA) that had \(|\eta|<\,2.7\) were simulated. No \(\eta\) limit was required for secondary particles produced in GEANT. No extra limitations on a detector volume were required. The full list of DICE datacards is given in Appendix E2.

#### 4.3.1 Simulation of muons from decays of \(\rm K^{\,\pm}/\pi^{\,\pm}\)

Minimum bias events containing muons from \(\rm K^{\pm}/\pi^{\,\pm}\) decays are the main source of the LVL1 single muon rate. For this reason we performed a dedicated simulation of these events.

The following method of simulation was used. In each PL simulated event all charged \(\rm K^{\,\pm},\pi^{\,\pm}\) with \(\rm p_{T}\,>\,6\,\,GeV\) and \(|\eta|<\,2.5\) were selected, and one of them was chosen to be forced to decay to a muon.

Lifetime of \(\rm K^{\pm}\) or \(\pi^{\,\pm}\) meson was selected according to an exponential distribution and the probability of the decay within the defined volume was normalized to 1. The volume for a decay was defined as the volume of the inner detector (a cylinder of 350 cm length and of 115 cm radius) extended by 26 cm along the track direction. This is done instead of a real simulation of the \(\rm K^{\pm}/\pi^{\,\pm}\) path in the material of the calorimeter. According to a selected lifetime a decay length DCPATH was calculated. All interactions were allowed until the \(\rm K^{\pm}/\pi^{\,\pm}\) trajectory was shorter than DCPATH. GEANT parameter STEMAX, which denotes a maximal allowed step size of tracking, was controlled after each step and was modified in the case when the distance to the decay length DCPATH was smaller then STEMAX.

The distribution of transverse distances of decay points is falling faster than what would correspond to the proper time, because of the edge effect: tracks pointing to cylinder left/right edges have shorter transverse distances than tracks pointing to the cylindrical surface. Another reason is that additional 26 cm are added in the direction of flight of the particle (which is correct).

## 5 Conclusions

The simulation summarized here was done in the period of preparation of technical design reports. The data were used to prove the capability of the ATLAS detector for the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region, typical for B-physics. To ensure the consistency between the documents, the methods of simulations were not changed within this period. In the future, the particle level program will include a more precise simulation of B-hadron decays, taking into account complex helicity amplitudes and different decay models. In detector simulations we will follow all necessary updates in agreement with requirements of combined detector and trigger groups, which are important users of B-physics (or background related to B-physics) detector simulated processes. As before, for those groups we will simulate also dedicated single particle or inclusive reactions, for methodic studies connected with B-physics.

Comment on how the table was done:

1. We used experimental ratio (B+-0) -> Jpsi(dir) : psi' : chi_{c1} : chi_{c2} 0.8 : 0.35 : 0.37 : < 0.38 in which we have choosen chi_{c2}=0.27, the idea was to achieve 1.14% for Direct (0.8%)+indirect(1.14-0.8)% Jpsi production.
2.We took the PDG96 values for jpsiK0 JpsiK0* and JpsiK+pi-. JpsiK0pi0 from isospin relations.
3. 4 body decays J/psi K+pi- pi0, J/psi K0 pi0 pi0 and J/psi K0pi+ pi- were done in analogy with 3 body decays of D0 meson to the same Kpipi systems. Here we have some very rough analogy, based on arguments of the same isospins and on the mass difference between B and Jpsi that is approximatelly as D0. Relative contribution between 3 body and 4 body decays was estimated based on D meson two body and three body decays.
4. Reactions with psi', chi_lc, chi_2c are copied from Jpsi and scaled according to point 1.

 How it was done:

 Neglecting Jpsi kinematics differences between  Lambda_b-> Jpsi Lambda0(1115.6) and  Lambda_b-> Jpsi + higher Lambdas, only first one was taken  multiplied by factor of 2.  Nonresonant states Jpsi pK- and nK0 added in the same way.

 Jpsi Sigma was added with the same branching as Jpsi Lambda.  Channles Jpsi + higher Sigmas - the same as for Lambdas.  3 body decays included by adding one pi0 to all previous.

 Other B-baryons are not in PYTHIA.

 Sigma_b's and other states decaying into  Lambda_b, Ksi_b and Omega_b by strong and electromagnetic  decays should stay as in PYTHIA.

Comment: For baryons modes we don't fill 0.01, because we don't know if  this is also true for baryons.

 DATA SAMPLES ================================

Comment1:  The number of decay channels will be enlarged (MDCY),  original channels will be moved to the end of the table  and new channels after them (Mark Lehto).
