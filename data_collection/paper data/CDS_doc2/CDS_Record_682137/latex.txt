**Abstract**

An assembly procedure is described for the pressurized drift tube chambers being developed for ATLAS. The procedure achieves a high precision placement (<20 \(\mu\) RMS) of the anode wires and achieves the required moderate precision (~100 \(\mu\) RMS) on the placement of the thin-wall tubes relative to the wires. A reusable template accurately places the anode wires at the tube ends. A new method for creating wire supports in long drift tubes transfers this placement to the supports.

**Introduction**

The assembly of a precision drift-tube chamber is made difficult by the need to control the sag of the anode wire in long pressurized tubes. The sag of the wires can be minimized by supporting the wire at regular intervals within the tube allowing tubes of any reasonable length and diameter to be constructed. In the monitored drift tube chambers (MDT) for ATLAS the tubes are aluminum, 3 cm in diameter. The longest tubes approach 6m in length and will require at least one wire support. A procedure is being developed where the wire, end plugs and supports are inserted as a unit into these tubes by a robot\({}^{1}\). The completed tubes are then stacked into superlayers (3 or 4 tube layers each), one superlayer on the top and one on the bottom of a mechanical support structure that also serves as an assembly jig and contains an internal alignment system. We have been investigating alternative methods for tube production and for module assembly that is simple, uses equipment that is easy to maintain, and can be exported easily to many sites.

In a recent ATLAS note\({}^{2}\) we described a new method for creating anode wire supports in long drift tubes using an adaptive support technique. Initially, the anode wire in an adaptive support is free to move within a small hole (1 mm) in the support but at a later time the wire is permanently fixed in the hole and to the support by injecting glue into the hole. We have verified that the injection and curing of the glue does not disturb the initial position of the wire within the 1 mm hole. One option for glue injection requires penetrating the tube wall with a needle. Another option is to pre-load the support with a small amount of glue before it is inserted into the tube. We have designed a support with a reservoir for a stable glue. Glue injection and curing is triggered by lowering the pressure within the tube; a simple method unique to chambers designed for pressurized operation. In this way the precise positioning of the wire relative to an external reference at the both ends of the tube can be translated to the internal adaptive supports.

This note describes a superlayer assembly procedure where the tubes are pre-wired and closed with end plugs but glue injection into the support holes is delayed until the tubes are bonded into a nearly rigid package. Adaptive supports are pre-loaded into the tubes and anode wires are soldered into precise wire guides that press-fit into the end plugs of each tube. The guide, commercially produced, contains a orifice that is precisely centered in the guide with a diameter only a few microns larger than the diameter of the anode wire. Once the wire is tensioned and secured the tubes can be tested for gas and high voltage leaks and stored until superlayer construction begins.

A surveyed flat surface serves as a reference plane and as a stacking jig for a superlayer. The pre-tested tubes are stacked to the required precision in bonding fixtures attached to the jig. Two reusable templates adjust the ends of the tubes by moving the wireguides slightly (a few 10's of microns) to center the wires in the holes of the template to high precision (<20 \(\upmu\)). The templates are fixed to the jig and constrain the wires to be in their proper grid positions in two dimensions at the ends of the tubes relative to the jig reference plane.

If the jig plane is oriented vertically the wires do not sag relative to it. If the jig is oriented horizontally the wires sag by known amount. In either case the tubes can follow the wires to required moderate precision (100 \(\upmu\) RMS). The jig reference plane is used to obtain high precision (<20\(\upmu\)) in the placement of fiducials on the surface of the package at the ends and at the support points at a precisely determined and fixed distance from the wires. Once the epoxy sets the superlayer becomes a nearly rigid package, the templates can be removed from the jig and the gas connections made to the tubes.

While still secured in the jig the pressure within the tubes is lowered slightly triggering the injection of the glue into the support holes. In this way all of the wires are simultaneously fixed at the internal supports in a pattern that is identical to the wire pattern at the ends relative to the fiducials. The fiducials are, therefore, a permanent external reference for the internal location of the wires. We do not rely on the accuracy of the tube walls, tube surfaces, extreme cleanliness or precision tube stacking to position the wires prior to bonding. We rely only on the accuracy of the jig and the stability of the adhesives to maintain the wire positions relative to the fiducials. This relieves most tolerances on the tube dimensions and on the tube straightness to levels normally supplied by industry for very thin-wall tubes and enables a simple assembly procedure. A more complete description of the components needed in the assembly procedure is presented in the following sections.

## 2 Wire Placement at the Tube Ends

A design study for an end plug and wire guide is shown in Fig. 1. The accurate placement of the wires at the ends is accomplished without using the aluminum tube wall or the surface of the end plugs as these surfaces may be too soft or variable to achieve the desired precision. We use, instead, a commercially produced wire guide containing a precision orifice concentric to a few microns with the outside of the guide. The diameter of the orifice is also controlled to a few microns and is slightly larger than the diameter of the anode wire. An anode wire threaded through the orifice can be accurately located at the center of the guide to better than a 10 \(\upmu\) accuracy. We have found that threading 50 \(\upmu\) wires through a 50+ \(\upmu\) orifice in an artificial jewel is easy if a tapered channel is included in the design of the wire guide as shown in Fig. 1.

The wire guide fits partially into the end plugs but not to the depth of the orifice. The outer surface of the guide is spherical and centered on the location of the precision orifice. When this surface is used to position the guide the design avoids any angular projection error in the position of the wire orifice.

The wire supports, pre-loaded with a glue cartridge and threaded with a leader wire, are inserted into the tube.1 The end plugs are passed over the ends of the leader wire and are then crimped into the tube ends.2 An anode wire is attached to the leader and pulled through one end plug, the 1 mm hole in each support down the length of the tube and through the other end plug. The leader is then detached and each end of the anode wire is threaded through the orifice in the wire guides. The wire guides can then be press fit into the end plugs, the anode wire tensioned and finally soldered (or crimped) into the guides.

A port in the wire guide is provided to inject a small amount of glue to the wire making a good gas seal and a second mechanical hold on the tension. The tube can now be tested for gas leaks and mechanical problems such as a loss of wire tension. Electrical properties can also be tested but without the anode wire glued to the supports.

The pre-tested tubes are stacked in a bonding jig using components similar to those shown in Fig. 2. During bonding the reusable combs shown in Fig. 2a position the tubes on the bottom and top layers of a superlayer to the required 100 \(\upmu\) accuracy (a factor of five less precision than is needed for the wires) with a 50 \(\upmu\) clearance to allow for some adjustment of the tube ends. If the tubes are horizontal the comb heights above the jig reference plane will compensate for the sag of the wires by letting the tubes bend by a similar amount to a 100 \(\upmu\) accuracy. If the tubes are vertical in the jig then all the comb heights will be the same because the wires do not sag in this orientation. There are as many combs as are necessary, perhaps one per meter, to achieve the 100 \(\upmu\) tube placement accuracy over the full length of the tubes. The middle layers are constrained to the same accuracy by the upper and lower layers in a close packed arrangement and by the side braces that constrain the tube package to its nominal width as shown in Fig. 2a.

A thin coating of structural epoxy is spread on each tube as it is added to the stack so that the crevice between each tube of the layer and the contact points with neighboring layers are coated with epoxy. Epoxied to the top and bottom of the tube package between the combs are thin flat sheets of fiberglass or aluminum. These stabilize the tube package with respect to pressure and provide a flat surface on which to mount the reference fiducials.

The jig has two reusable templates with holes as shown in Fig 2b that match the diameter of the spherical surface on the wire guides. Each template has been made from a master template thus insuring an identical pattern of wires for all chambers. After the tubes are stacked in the jig and before the epoxy has set the templates are placed over the wire guides moving the tubes slightly (\(\sim\)50 \(\upmu\)) to align the guides with the template holes. Fixtures to the jig place the two templates, wire guides and, therefore, the ends of the anode wires to the required <20 \(\upmu\) precision in two dimensions in an absolute coordinate system with respect to the jig reference plane and remain there as the tubes are bonded into a nearly rigid package.

At this time gauge bars with fiducial pins permanently fixed to them as shown in Fig 2c are bonded to the top of the package at each end and at intervals corresponding to the support locations. The fiducials are placed to a <20 \(\upmu\) accuracy with respect to and at a fixed distance from the wires in two dimensions as can be determined by spacers attached to the jig epoxy fills a small gap between the gauge bars and the tube package. If the jig is horizontal the height of the gauge bars relative to the jig reference plane can compensate for the well known sag of the wires (and tubes). If the jig is oriented with the wires and tubes running vertically then no compensation is necessary as the wires must be straight and parallel to the reference plane. In this way the tubes are fixed with their centerlines located on the wires to a 100 \(\upmu\) accuracy, as specified

After the structural epoxy cures the superlayer becomes a nearly rigid structure. With the tube package still in the jig the templates can be removed and the gas manifold attached to each tube. If the pressure is then lowered slightly in the tubes it will trigger the injection of the pre-loaded glue into the 1 mm hole in each support. In this way the wires

Figure 2: Jig Components: a) Precision Template, b) Tube Combs, c) Gauge Bar

are fixed in their current locations in the supports. These locations are on a precise grid determined by the templates to <20 u accuracy with respect to the fiducials, as specified.

After the support glue fully cures the combs can be removed allowing the bonded superlayer packages to be released from the jig and transported to a site where they will be mounted on the alignment/support structures. Mounting points are located at the ends of the superlayers and at intervals corresponding to the location of the internal supports. Small adjustments can be made at the mounts to realign the fiducials of both superlayers as they were in the bonding jig and the nominal alignment system parameters recorded. The mounts can now be permanently fixed in their current positions and the alignment system will monitor the distortions of the chamber package from this initial state. The fiducials, however, will always remain as a visible and permanent reference to the wires; a safety feature that should be present in all assembly procedures.

### The Adaptive Supports

The remote injection of glue into the 1 mm hole in the supports is accomplished using a support as shown in Fig. 3. Prior to insertion in the tube a polyethylene cartridge containing a small amount of glue is loaded into the support in a slot shaped for the cartridge. The cartridge has two reservoirs, one for gas (-20 u) and one for the glue (-3 u), connected by a narrow tube.

Figure 3: Wire Support with Glue Injector

The glue reservoir has a nozzle directed into the 1 mm hole. Surface tension prevents the glue from running out of its reservoir prematurely. The wall of the 1 mm hole opposite the cartridge is painted with an activator that will start the curing process once the glue is injected into the hole. If the pressure in the tube is reduced to 0.9 bar the gas will expand in its reservoir by about 10%, pushing some glue (\(-2\)\(\mu\)l) out of its reservoir through the nozzle into the 1 mm hole. The glue is allowed to fully cure before the tubes are re-pressurized.

We have produced some simple prototypes of this glue injection system. In cartridges similar to the one shown in Fig. 3, tested with water, a lowering of the pressure indeed pushes the fluid into the 1 mm hole. Our first tests of this procedure with glue will use acrylic glues and activators. These glues are reasonably stable but will set in a few minutes once activated.

## Conclusions

We have discussed assembly procedures for the ATLAS MDT chambers using adaptive wire supports. These procedures can accommodate any number of supports along the length of the tube and any number of tube layers and do not rely on the walls of the aluminum tubes to position the wires to the specified accuracy.

The assembly places fiducials on the tube package that are visible and remain as a permanent reference to the wires. This will allow chamber (superlayer) construction to be asynchronous with the development and construction of the support structure, alignment components, mounting hardware and perhaps other components of the MDT system. Given the long lead time needed to assemble the large number of superlayers required for ATLAS this independence should remove many of the possible bottlenecks in the construction schedule.

We hope to produce a number of supports and glue cartridges, test some of them ourselves, but also provide a significant number to others who are interested in making tests of these construction procedures.
