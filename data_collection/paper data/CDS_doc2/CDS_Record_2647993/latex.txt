## 1 ATLAS results used in top properties summary figure

* The top charge result is measured in single-lepton \(t\bar{t}\) events at 7 TeV [1].
* The most precise results per LHC energy are used for the top mass points. For 7 TeV  the combined single and dilepton result is used [2]. For 8 TeV  the dilepton result is used [3].
* The top width is measured in single-lepton \(t\bar{t}\) events at 8 TeV [4].
* The spin correlation results used all use the lab-frame \(\Delta\phi(\ell,\ell)\) observable in dileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events at 7 TeV [5] and \(e\mu\)-only events at 8 and 13 TeV [6; 7].
* The 7 TeV charge asymmetry result uses a leptonic pseudo-rapidity asymmetry in dilepton events [8], whereas the 8 TeV result uses top rapidity asymmetry in single-lepton \(t\bar{t}\) events [9].
* All \(|V_{tb}|\) results are derived from \(t\)-channel single top data [10; 11; 12].

Figure 2: Summary of the most precise top-quark related properties per LHC run energy compared to the corresponding theoretical expectations. The properties are categorised as intrinsic properties of the top quark or as properties of its production or decay. Theoretical predictions for the 7 TeV and 8 TeV charge asymmetry and spin correlation results were taken from the predictions by Bernreuther and Si at NLO [13; 14]. For the 13 TeV spin correlation result no directly comparable prediction is available so the uncertainty is taken from Powheg-Box MC samples including scale and PDF uncertainties. The prediction for the top mass is taken from global EW fits by the GFitter group including all available data (including Higgs data) up to 2014 but with top data removed [15]. The prediction for the top width is a LO prediction from Gao, Li, and Zhu [16] and the uncertainty is calculated using NLO Powheg-Box MC samples. The predictions for \(|V_{tb}|\) are taken from the Particle Data Group [17] and the prediction for the top charge measurement is set to 2/3 with no theoretical uncertainty.

Figure 3: Summary of ATLAS measurements of the top-pair production cross-section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy compared to the NNLO QCD calculation complemented with NNLL resummation (top++2.0 ). The theory band represents uncertainties due to renormalisation and factorisation scale, parton density functions and the strong coupling. The measurements and the theory calculation are quoted at \(m_{t}=172.5\) GeV. Measurements made at the same centre-of-mass energy are slightly offset for clarity.

Figure 4: Summary of the latest ATLAS direct mtop measurements. The results are compared with the ATLAS mtop combination. For each measurement, the statistical uncertainty, the jet scale factor (JSF) and b-jet scale factor (bJSF) contributions (when applicable) as well as the sum of the remaining uncertainties are reported separately. The JSF, bJSF contributions are statistical in nature and apply to analyses performing in-situ (top quark pair base) jet energy calibration procedures.

Figure 5: Summary of the latest ATLAS direct mtop measurements. The results are compared to the ATLAS, Tevatron and Tevatron+LHC mtop combinations. For each measurement, the statistical uncertainty, the jet scale factor (JSF) and b-jet scale factor (bJSF) contributions (when applicable) as well as the sum of the remaining uncertainties are reported separately. The JSF, bJSF contributions are statistical in nature and apply to analyses performing in-situ (top quark pair base) jet energy calibration procedures.

Figure 6: Summary of the ATLAS direct mtop measurements. The figure shows the latest results, as well as previous results that are now superseeded. The results are compared with the ATLAS, Tevatron and Tevatron+LHC mtop combinations. For each measurement, the statistical uncertainty, the jet scale factor (JSF) and b-jet scale factor (bJSF) contributions (when applicable) as well as the sum of the remaining uncertainties are reported separately. The JSF, bJSF contributions are statistical in nature and apply to analyses performing in-situ (top quark pair base) jet energy calibration procedures.

Figure 7: Summary of the ATLAS and CMS direct mtop measurements. The results are compared with the LHC and Tevatron+LHC mtop combinations. For each measurement, the statistical uncertainty includes the jet scale factor (JSF) and b-jet scale factor (bJSF) contributions (when applicable), while the sum of the remaining systematic uncertainties is reported separately. The JSF and bJSF contributions are statistical in nature and apply to analyses performing in-situ (top quark pair based) jet energy calibration procedures.
