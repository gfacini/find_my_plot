P\({}_{\rm T}\) resolution with the post-Annecy tracker layout

_Alan Poppleton_

## 0 Introduction

Substantial changes to the inner detector layout and performance were adopted at the June 1994 IDWG workshop in Annecy. In particular, it was decided:

* to choose a panel-style arrangement, i.e. with essentially all of the discrete tracking detectors placed inside the TRT
* to require 6 space-points/track from the discrete tracking detectors
* to introduce forward pixel detectors to give 2 pixel vertexing layers across the full inner detector acceptance (\(|\eta|<2.5\))
* to accept the proposal by the calorimeter group for a shorter solenoid coil, 5.3m long, in order to decrease the amount of material in front of the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter. Thus the field integral was reduced in the forward direction with a consequent degradation of the momentum resolution.

The forward detector layout continued to evolve up to the time of the Technical Proposal, mainly driven by cost-saving measures. For example, the small MSGC wheels with 2 rings of 10cm radial extent were replaced by wheels with a single 16cm ring (and half the electronic channel count). The number and positioning of these wheels were modified to maintain acceptance.

The purpose of this note is to evaluate the momentum resolution for the layout presented in the Technical Proposal, and to explore the effect of reasonable perturbations to this layout. The inner detector performance specifications [1] require \(\sigma(p_{\rm T})/p_{\rm T}\!<\!30\%\) for \(p_{\rm T}\!=\!500\)GeV particles with \(|\eta|\!<\!2.0\), relaxing to \(\sigma(p_{\rm T})/p_{\rm T}\!<\!50\%\) at \(\eta\!=\!2.5\). It is shown that, although the proposed tracker comfortably meets these specifications in the extended-barrel region (up to \(|\eta|\!\sim\!1.9\)), reverse bending effects due to the short solenoid coil make it difficult to attain the desired performance in the end-cap region.

The note is organized into sections on:

* the solenoidal magnetic field* the momentum resolution for the Technical Proposal layout
* the robustness of the observed performance and the sensitivity to the relative contribution from each sub-detector

The deeper questions of the relative pattern-recognition properties and reconstruction performance between the central and forward regions, and between alternative layouts, remain under study.

### 2.0 Solenoidal magnetic field

The solenoidal field-lines are axial in the central region, then bow radially outwards from the axis towards the end of the coil and complete a magnetic loop outside the coil with the help of an iron flux-return yoke positioned behind the calorimetry. The inner tracking cavity is appreciably longer than the solenoidal coil, such that the last tracking detector lies in the fringe field about 0.70m beyond the end of the coil. For accurate tracking in this fringe-field region, it is necessary to take the local field direction into account as well as to allow for the fall in its magnitude. It is not possible to bring the iron return yoke sufficiently close to strongly influence the field-line direction at the end of the tracker without compromising the end-cap calorimetry. Forward-going tracks from the vertex region change the sign of their vector product of track and field directions at about 0.25m before the coil aperture. Thus primary tracks reaching the last tracking detector are subject to reverse bending in the orthogonal R-\(\phi\) plane for approximately the last quarter of their length.

The effect of iron from the tile calorimeter and solenoid return yoke has been included in a detailed calculation [2] on the behaviour of the solenoidal magnetic field using the POIS-SON program. A field map is available in the form of a grid of values within a cylindrical volume with 5m radius and 14m length. However, since the field in the volume occupied by the inner detector is only slightly influenced by the external iron, a simplified analytic representation was preferred in order to reduce the time spent in computation. Along a solenoid axis the analytic solution [3] to Maxwell's equations gives best agreement with the map for a coil of 1.24m radius and 5.23m length with the remaining variables (number of turns times current density) set to give a 2T field at the centre.

The magnetic field is close to being constant for the barrel region of the inner detector, with a maximum variation of around 2%. Going outwards along the coil axis (Z) the longitudinal field component (B\({}_{\rm Z}\)) falls by about 12% halfway along the tracker length (Z=1.7m), reaches approximately half its central value at the coil aperture (Z=2.65m) and continues to fall to around 0.5T by the end of the inner detector. The same general behaviour is observed off-axis, with B\({}_{\rm Z}\) falling to around 1T at the coil aperture for all inner detector radii. However the field gradient near the aperture increases with radius. Thus at the outer tracker radius, B\({}_{\rm Z}\) remains closer to 2T inside the coil length, then falls off rapidly to 0.3T by the end of the tracker.

The on-axis analytic solution was taken with an additional B\({}_{\rm Z}\) term having an R\({}^{2}\) dependence and a dipole-like behaviour about the solenoid aperture in Z. This expression agrees with the grid values of the field map to 0.007T rms within the inner tracker volume (i.e. for Z\(<\)3.4m and R\(<\)1.0m). The radial field component was obtained by applying Maxwell's equation \(\rm\ div\ \textbf{B}=0\) to the expression for B\({}_{\rm Z}\).

The field components are shown below, in the form of surface plots seen from different viewpoints in R-Z projection. Grid lines are drawn every 0.33m in Z and every 0.10m in R. The Z-dependence is clear when seen from the side (left-hand plots), whilst the variations in radial behaviour are easier to understand by looking at the longitudinal component from an upstream viewpoint and the radial component from the magnet centre (right-hand plots).

Lorentz angle effects will significantly affect the MSGC performance wherever the angle between the field direction and Z-axis becomes appreciable. This angle is plotted for the forward part of the inner detector below, with shading used to represent the regions occupied by MSGC's:

Footnote 2: The \(\eta\)-value is calculated from the \(\eta\)-value by using the \(\eta\)-value.

For the inner MSGC wheels (0.44m\(<\)R\(<\)0.60m) the angle is around or below 5\({}^{\rm o}\), apart from the last wheel at Z\(\sim\)2.6m where it varies between 12\({}^{\rm o}\) and 16\({}^{\rm o}\). For the large end wheel the situation worsens in a fairly linear fashion with radius, going from an angle of 16\({}^{\rm o}\) at R\(=\)0.5m to about 33\({}^{\rm o}\) at R\(=\)1.0m.

### Momentum resolution

For every longitudinal vertex-coordinate and \(\eta\)-value under consideration, a high momentum particle is tracked through the solenoidal field to obtain the distance to, and magnetic deflection at, each contributing detector layer. The detector resolutions are propagated to 3 parameters representing the track in transverse projection: 1/pT, azimuthal angle and impact parameter at the vertex. Any contributions from measurement inaccuracies in the R-Z plane are assumed to be negligible. For each \(\eta\)-value the results are averaged over the longitudinal intersection region. This is taken to extend to 3\(\sigma\) on either side of the apparatus centre according to a Gaussian distribution with \(\sigma\)=56mm. The narrow beam spot allows a 15\(\upmu\)m precision to be assumed for the transverse vertex coordinates.

By design the inner detector provides 6 'discrete' hits (forming space-points) and an average of 36 'continuous' TRT hits (in transverse projection) per track. The discrete hits provide vertexing, sagitta and \(\theta\) measurement plus a stiff-track trigger. The continuous tracking complements the performance by adding a precise transverse end-point for momentum determination. It also provides independent trigger information and significantly augments the overall pattern-recognition capability (especially for finding K\({}^{0}\) decays, for distinguishing primary electrons from photon conversions, and for removing fake-track hit-associations within jets). An R-Z projection of the tracker layout is sketched below, with \(\eta\) lines drawn from a 2\(\sigma\) displaced vertex:

Silicon and MSGC detector layers are illustrated using thin lines, whereas the GaAs detectors are drawn with a thicker line to distinguish them from the MSGC's at similar Z-values. The shaded areas represent the TRT. The barrel region consists of 2 pixel layers, 4 SCT layers and the barrel TRT. The pixels are at R=0.115m and 0.165m, extending to Z=0.350 and 0.414m respectively. They are assumed to measure with a precision of 14\(\upmu\)m in the transverse direction. The SCT layers are at R=0.30, 0.40, 0.50 and 0.60m, extend to Z=0.82m and have 15\(\upmu\)m precision on associated \(\phi\)u or \(\phi\)v hits.

In addition to the TRT modules, in each Z-direction the forward/end-cap regions contain 4 pixel disks, 2 GaAs wheels, 12 MSGC'small' wheels and one 'large' MSGC wheel. The pixel disks are at Z=0.499, 0.554, 0.799 and 0.850m. They cover from R=0.1145 to 0.2125m with 14\(\upmu\)m transverse measurement precision. The GaAs wheels are at Z=1.567 and 1.835m, have 10\(\upmu\)m precision on associated uv hits, and cover from R=0.25 to 0.40m and from 0.29 to 0.44m respectively. An MSGC wheel has 35\(\upmu\)m transverse precision on associated uv\(\phi\) hits. The'small' wheels consist of a single ring covering from R=0.44 to 0.60m, and they are centred at Z=0.900, 0.972, 1.043, 1.187, 1.285, 1.382, 1.480, 1.577, 1.711, 1.845, 1.978 and 2.656m. The 'large' wheel lies between Z=3.32 and 3.37m with three rings to cover from R=0.51 to 0.97m. From the sketch it can be seen that the forward disk arrangement has been chosen to satisfy the 6 discrete-tracker points requirement (2 pixel plus 4 space-point hit-associations) out to an unfavourable vertex displacement of 2\(\sigma\).

A small 'crack' (with only 5 hits) remains at just above \(|\eta|\)=1 in order to leave sufficient room for the barrel services.

The TRT is simulated by 4 equally-spaced'master' points per track, at radii of 0.685, 0.795, 0.905 and 1.015m going from the centre out to, respectively, Z=2.776, 2.929, 3.081 and 3.234m, then continuing inwards to R=0.51m. A gap is left between the barrel and forward straws going from Z=0.800 to 0.890m. Tracks are assigned less master points if they cross this gap or are close to the high \(\eta\) acceptance limit. Note that the gap is displaced from the barrel/forward transition in the discrete tracking. Each master point is given a precision of 120\(\upmu\)m to give an overall 60\(\upmu\)m precision on most tracks.

In the above figure the momentum resolution is shown as a function of \(|\eta|\), calculated for tracks with p\({}_{\rm T}\)=500GeV. The thick curve represents the resolution achieved using the sole-noidal field and averaging over the full Gaussian vertex distribution, while the thin curve shows the worst resolution obtained for vertices lying within 2\(\sigma\) of Z=0. The resolution varies from \(\sim\)25% in the extended barrel region to almost 70% at \(\eta\)=2.5, with a reduced radial track length and the falling magnetic field causing the degradation in the end-cap region. The transition from barrel to forward TRT is apparent at \(\eta\)\(\sim\)0.8, as is the improvement given by the MSGC end-wheel above \(\eta\)\(\sim\)1.9. At high momenta the resolution scales with p\({}_{\rm T}\), however below \(\sim\)40GeV multiple scattering becomes significant with an \(\eta\)-dependent contribution of between 1 and 1.5% to \(\sigma\)(p\({}_{\rm T}\))/p\({}_{\rm T}\) according to the amount of material traversed.

The other two curves on the plot illustrate the effect on the high-rapidity performance caused by the non-ideal magnetic field in the forward tracker. The dashed curve is the resolution that would be available from a constant B=2T field along the Z-axis, while the dotted curve just above it was obtained by taking the 5.3m solenoid B\({}_{\rm Z}\) component with the radial component set to zero. From this it can be deduced that the reverse bending, caused by the field lines bowing out from the axis towards the end of the tracker, creates a much more serious degradation to performance than the fall-off in field value. At \(\eta\)=2.5 the corresponding momentum resolutions are 43, 51 and 67% for the constant, B\({}_{\text{R}}\)=0 and 3-D fields.

### Detector sensitivity and performance robustness

The performance presented in the previous section is somewhat optimistic in that no account has been taken of subdetector misalignment or malfunction. It is also prudent to foresee the effect of'spoilt' hits and local inefficiency, especially with the increased detector occupancy and radiation damage expected during high luminosity running. Thus it is reassuring to find that the overall momentum resolution is relatively insensitive to reasonable changes in any individual detector precision. The sensitivity of the momentum resolution to the resolution of the barrel detectors is illustrated below left; the sensitivity to the resolution of the end-cap detectors is shown on the right:

In these plots, the changes in detector resolution and momentum resolution are expressed as relative quantities. By far the largest \(\sigma({\text{p}}_{\text{T}})\) sensitivity, namely 20-30% for a factor 2 change in detector precision, is observed for the track end-point measurement (i.e. for the barrel TRT and MSGC end-wheel). Thus the end-point measurement dominates in the error propagation -- it has a lower absolute precision than measurements of the vertex and sagitta regions.

For a constant magnetic field, it has previously been noted _[4]_ that, given an outer measurement with an appreciably lower precision than the vertex, the optimum position for a high precision intermediate'sagitta' measurement lies at around one third of the distance from the vertex to the outer measurement. This corresponds to the inner part of the SCT in the barrel region. Since all the barrel discrete-layers have fairly similar precision, it follows that SCT layers 1+2 are the main contributors to the sagitta measurement, and that \(\sigma(p_{T})\) is more sensitive to their resolution than to the pixels or the other SCT layers.

For the falling magnetic field distribution encountered in the forward direction, the optimum'sagitta' position moves closer to the vertex. The end-cap pixel layers, which are at around a quarter of the measured track length, are essentially at the optimum distance for momentum determination. However the GaAs detectors, at close to half the track length, are expected to have a significantly higher measurement precision. The result is that the \(\sigma(p_{T})\) sensitivity is shared between these detectors.

The remaining (low sensitivity) detector layers are necessary for vertexing, track angle measurement and pattern recognition in high luminosity and jet environments. They also provide robustness in the case of local detector confusion or malfunction -- for example the resolution obtained without the MSGC end-wheel is given in the plot below:

This wheel is relatively expensive because of its large area, and its performance is also subject to the most severe Lorentz angle effects. However the momentum resolution without this wheel is degraded by a factor around 1.3 for \(|\eta|\)\(>\)2.3 (where the last small MSGC wheel provides an end-point), and by considerably more in the region 2.0\(<\)\(|\eta|\)\(<\)2.3.

The robustness of the momentum resolution to removal of the pixel or TRT detectors is shown in the following plot (next page). The effect of the transverse vertex constraint is also illustrated. The barrel region is certainly robust as the momentum performance specification is satisfied in the absence of either the vertex constraint or the TRT. However continuing out to the extended barrel region (1.6\(<\)\(|\eta|\)\(<\)2.0), i.e. tracks outside the inner SCT layer but not yet in the GaAs detectors, the performance depends on the preseand the vertex constraint. This contribution to momentum measurement from the first set of end-cap pixels is presumably to the detriment of their vertexing power -- it is an indication that a (small) rearrangement of the detectors in this region could improve the robustness.
