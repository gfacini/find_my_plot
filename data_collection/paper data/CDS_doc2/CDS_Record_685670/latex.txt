## 1 Introduction

The gas ionization calorimeter of the high pressure was considered as a forward calorimeter (FC) in the ATLAS set-up[1]. Some prototypes of such type calorimeters are described in [2]. Influence of an electronic noise will be analyzed here for the basic version of the composite gas ionization calorimeter [3][4]. This calorimeter consists of the electromagnetic (EM) and hadronic (HAD) sections. The basic calorimeter version for the simulation has the following features.

* Both sections are composed of the square blocks with the same cross-section (32*32 \(cm^{2}\)) and with the block Z-axis parallel to the beam line. The total calorimeter length is of 2.5 m with the 5 cm gap between the sections. The FC is situated at the distance of 15.4 m from the interaction point and its total cross-section can be described by the circle with the radius R= 1.5 m. The calorimeter has a hole in its center with the radius R= 20 cm which can be filled in the HAD section with the copper passive material.
* The blocks in the EM section with the iron wall thickness of 2 mm have the flaky structure along the Z-axis and consist of 13 iron absorberplates with the thickness of 3 cm. The gas gap between the absorber plates is of 6 mm. The charge is collected from the iron plates installed in the middle of the gas gaps. Each block has 4*4 cells in its cross-section.
* The HAD blocks contain the iron gas ionization tubes with the inner diameter of 0.68 cm and with the iron rod inside (0.36 cm diameter). These blocks have also 4*4 cells in their cross-sections and each cell contains 64 tubes (8*8). Lead is used as an absorber.

The calorimeter is filled with the gas mixture (\(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\)) under the pressure of 15 atm in the EM section and 30 atm in the HAD section.

The simulation has been done with the help of the GEANT3.15 code. The particle flux from the interaction point sows uniformly some cells area. The particle energy values are in the range of (3-150) GeV.

Most of the amplitude distributions obtained for the analyzed calorimeter prototypes are not fitted to the Gaussian, and the histogram RMS values as an estimate for the amplitude dispersions are used here. The energy resolution parameters are defined from the expression

\[\frac{RMS}{E}=\frac{A}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus B \tag{1}\]

by the approximation of the simulated data, where E is the measured energy.

The MINIBIAS and 2-jet events were generated by means of the PYTHIA code[5]. To reproduce the experimental multiplicity distributions of particles[6], the simulation was done with the presence of multiple interactions.

For the simulation purpose the MINIBIAS jets and jets from 2-jet events have been examined with the different jet energies. The MINIBIAS jets are defined here as a collection of the incoming particles inside the circle with the radius in the range of \(30<R<130\) (cm) in the (X-Y) plane (with the aim to diminish the energy leakage). The same constraint has been used for 2-jet events.

Jets from 2-jet events are defined as a number of the particles in the circle with the radius R = 0.5 in the coordinate plane of \((\eta,\phi)\) variables. The cone size of R = 0.5 is chosen as the optimum value with the aim to improve the W mass resolution in the presence of an average pile up of 40 MB events[7]. The center of this circle is defined by the particle flow from the string evolution in PYTHIA.

The total \(P_{T}\) value measured with the help of the FC is determined by the sum of some calorimeter cells

\[P_{T}=\sqrt{{P_{(T,x)}}^{2}+{P_{(T,y)}}^{2}},\]

\[P_{(T,x)}=\sum A_{i}sin\theta_{i}cos\phi_{i},\]

\[P_{(T,y)}=\sum A_{i}sin\theta_{i}sin\phi_{i},\]

where \(A_{i}\) - the amplitude in cell \(i\), \(\theta_{i}\) and \(\phi_{i}\) are the angle coordinates of cell \(i\) in the ATLAS set-up.

The total amplitude value of a signal is defined as the sum of the cell amplitudes with calibration coefficients corresponding to both calorimeter sections. These coefficients are determined by minimization of the following functional:

\[F=\sum^{event}(E-\sum^{cells}(k_{1}A_{1}^{i}+k_{2}A_{2}^{i}))^{2}. \tag{2}\]

E - the energy of the incoming particles (E = 100 GeV in the case of a single pion and E = 200 GeV in the case of jets), \(k_{j}\) - calibration coefficient.

The coordinate resolution for single particle and jet is defined as

\[<x>=\frac{\sum x_{i}*A_{i}}{\sum A_{i}}, \tag{3}\]

where \(x_{i}\) - the cell coordinate. It is necessary to mention that the coordinate resolution can be improved if one use the following expression:

\[<x>=\frac{\sum x_{i}*W_{i}}{\sum W_{i}},\]

\[W_{i}=max\{0,[W_{0}+ln(A_{i}/A_{T})]\},\ \ A_{T}=\sum A_{i},\]

where \(W_{0}\) is a free parameter [8]. For hadronic showers and jets estimate (3) is quite sufficient. However, for a single electromagnetic shower definition (3) contains the systematic error, caused by the large cell size in comparison with the transverse size of an electromagnetic shower. To diminish this effect it is convenient to proceed to the polar coordinates r and \(\phi\), where r and \(\phi\) are the radius and the azimuthal angle in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis, respectively[2].

The electronic noise in both calorimeter sections can take the following values (in the case of the calorimeter calibration for pions)* pessimistic estimation \[\sigma^{EM}_{noise}(cell)=0.6\;\;GeV,\quad\sigma^{HAD}_{noise}(cell)=2.0\;\;GeV.\]
* optimistic estimation \[\sigma^{EM}_{noise}(cell)=0.3\;\;GeV,\quad\sigma^{HAD}_{noise}(cell)=1.0\;\;GeV.\]

By the term \(cell\) is meant the tower in the corresponding calorimeter section.

## 2 Simulation results

The FC is calibrated for all analyzed objects \((e,\pi,jet)\). This allows to determine the accuracy of the amplitude reconstruction of a signal in the presence of the electronic noise in the calorimeter cells. The electronic noise during the simulation is introduced in the following way.

* First of all the calorimeter response is defined to an incoming object with the help of the GEANT3.15 code.
* Thereafter, the random values are added for each cell. The random value distribution is described by the Gaussian with the zero mean and the noise dispersion defined above. The scale of the noise level corresponds to the calorimeter calibration by a single hadron.
* Therefore the next step is to normalize the given random values by the coefficient corresponding to the appropriate calibration of an analyzed object.

Several methods can be used to determine the signal value in calorimeters in the presence of an electronic noise in cells. Among them are the following

1. Method 1. The signal value equals to the sum of the cell amplitudes provided that for each cell the absolute amplitude value \(A_{i}\) is greater than a some cut threshold: \[A=\sum^{cells}A_{i}\;\;,\;\;(|A_{i}|>c_{1}\star\sigma_{i}),\] (4)where \(\sigma_{i}\) is the noise dispersion in cell \(i\), \(c_{1}\) is the coefficient to be determined. This definition of the signal gives practically the non-distorted amplitude distribution, but one can find the negative signal value.
2. Method 2. The signal value equals to the sum of the cell amplitudes provided that the amplitude value \(A_{i}\) is greater than a some cut threshold for each cell: \[A=\sum^{cells}A_{i}\ \,\ \ (A_{i}>c_{2}*\sigma_{i}),\] (5) One can expect that this definition of the signal gives non-simmetrical amplitude distribution and the enlarged average amplitude value, but at the same time there are no negative signal values.
3. Method 3. The signal value equals to the sum of the cell amplitudes with the weight coefficients determined from the minimization of functional (2). The cell amplitudes satisfy condition (4). \[A=w_{1}*(\sum^{EM}_{cells}A_{i}+w_{2}*\sum^{HAD}_{cells}A_{i}),\] (6) In this case coefficients \(w_{j}\) depend on the energy of any analyzed object because of the relation (signal/noise).
4. Method 4. The signal value equals to the sum of the cell amplitudes with the weight coefficients determined from the minimization of functional (2). The cell amplitudes satisfy condition (5). Coefficients \(w_{j}\) depend on the energy of any analyzed object because of the relation (signal/noise).

To measure the total signal amplitude it is necessary define the number of cells to be summed or the radius \(R_{opt}\) around the cell with the maximum amplitude value. This cell is considered as the center of the shower energy in each calorimeter section independently.

### Calorimeter response to pion

The centers of a particle shower in both calorimeter sections are the cells with the maximum energy content. That is one have to find one cell only with the maximum energy content. Used the group of cells (9 cells) to find the shower center, there were obtained results which are worse than in the former case (about 10%).

It is assumed that the signal is observed when in any calorimeter section one or both of these chosen cells \((i,j)\) satisfy the following condition

\[A_{i,j}>3.5*\sigma_{k},\ \ \ (k=1,2) \tag{7}\]

where \(\sigma_{k}\)- the noise value in cells for the EM and HAD sections. Due to the cell noise the coordinate definition in one of the sections can be wrong. Therefore it is necessary to make the shower centers in both sections agree with each other. According to the simulations, it is known that the distance L between these centers in the (X-Y) plane can be very large (the event distribution along distance L has an exponentional like shape). It is believed that the shower centers are defined correct in the case of \(L<30\) cm. About 80% and 97% of events fit this condition at the pion energy of E= 9 GeV and E= 150 GeV respectively. Otherwise, when \(L>30\) cm, in that section where the ratio \(A_{i}/\sigma_{k}\) is least the shower center is considered as the cell \(j\) with the same coordinate as in other calorimeter section.

The efficiency of the event selection is presented in fig.1 where the solid curve is the part of events detected with the help of condition (7). Another curves are the event registration efficiencies when the chosen cell in the EM or HAD sections coincide with or adjacent to the cell chosen in the case of no electronic noise.

According to these data one can conclude that with the pessimistic noise value the signal in the calorimeter can be detected confidently at the particle energy greater than 10 GeV and greater than 3 GeV for the optimistic noise value. The optimum radius value \(R_{opt}\) around the cell with the maximum energy content is defined by the minimum energy resolution RES:

\[RES=\frac{\sqrt{(RMS)^{2}+\Delta^{2}}}{E}\,\ \ \Delta=A-E, \tag{8}\]

where \(RMS\) - the dispersion of the amplitude distribution, E- the energy of an incoming object, A- the average value of the amplitude distribution. Infig.2 one can see dependence of the energy resolution RES on the radius R in the EM and HAD sections for the different amplitude cuts in cells in the case of the pessimistic noise estimation. According to these data the following optimum values of \(R_{opt}\) were chosen:

\[R_{opt}(EM)=20\ cm\ \,\ \ R_{opt}(HAD)=28\ cm.\]

The corresponding number of cells and the detected part of energy are presented in Table 1. For the chosen \(R_{opt}\) the energy loss equals 5% and 3% at the incident energy of 9 GeV and 150 GeV. The energy resolution for the chosen calorimeter range in the case of no electronic noise is

\[\frac{RMS}{E_{R}}=\frac{83\pm 3}{\sqrt{E_{R}}}\oplus(7.5\pm 1.0),\]

where \(E_{R}\)- the signal amplitude in the range of the defined cells. The corresponding noise term from the expression

\[\frac{RMS}{E_{R}}=\frac{A}{\sqrt{E_{R}}}\oplus B\oplus\frac{C}{E_{R}} \tag{9}\]

is determined from the data at the fixed parameters A and B in the energy range of (25-150) GeV. The fitted C values are presented in Table 4 for four methods of the amplitude definition. Here one can see also the d-parameter from the expression

\[\frac{E_{R}}{E_{R}^{0}}=1+\frac{d}{\left(E_{R}^{0}\right)^{1.5}}\ . \tag{10}\]

Expression (10) takes into account the deviation of the measured \(E_{R}\) amplitude from the amplitude \(E_{R}^{0}\) in the case of no electronic noise. One can see that Method 2 gives better resolution than Method 1 but it has the strong dependence on the cell number analysed and the larger deviation of the measured amplitude from the true one. Methods 3 and 4 give the better resolution as it was expected.

Dependence of the weight factor \(w_{2}\) on the particle energy is given in fig. 4. In fig. 5 and 6 one can see the amplitude distributions for the first and second methods of the amplitude definitions. There are no large difference between these two kind of the distributions in the high energy range.

The accuracy of the \(\phi\) and R coordinates definition is determined in the energy range of (25-150) GeV

\[\sigma_{\phi}=\frac{A}{E^{2}}+B.\]

\[\sigma_{R}=\frac{A}{E^{1.5}}+B.\]

The fitted parameters are given in Table 5. The \(P_{T}\) resolution is given in the form[4]

\[\frac{|\Delta\vec{P_{T}}|}{P_{T}}=\frac{76}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 6\oplus\frac{C_{1}}{ E},\]

\[\frac{\sigma(|\Delta\vec{P_{T}}|)}{P_{T}}=\frac{50}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 5\oplus\frac{C_{2 }}{E},\]

where

\[|\Delta\vec{P_{T}}|=|\vec{P_{T}}-\vec{P_{T}}^{\it meas}|\]

The \(\vec{P_{T}}^{\it meas}\) is the total measured \(\vec{P_{T}}\) value of the incoming particle after the simulation of the FC. The fitted \(C_{j}\) values are given in Table 6.

### Calorimeter response to electron

The energy and the center of an electromagnetic shower are defined here only in the EM calorimeter section. The signal is observed when in the EM section there is cell \(i\) with the maximum energy content and at the condition

\[A_{i}>3.5*\sigma_{1},\]

where \(\sigma_{1}\)- the noise value in cells for EM section.

Because of the small lateral size of an electromagnetic shower the signal is defined in the range of 9 cells only or at the radius R= 12 cm around the cell with the maximum energy content. It corresponds to 2.4% and 0.6% energy lack for the particle energy 9 GeV and 150 GeV (see Table 2).

The efficiency of the event selection is presented in fig.1 where the solid curve is the event fraction detected with the help of condition (13). Another curves are the event registration efficiencies when the chosen cell in the EM section coincide with or adjacent to the cell chosen in the case of no electronic noise.

According to these data one can conclude that even with the pessimistic noise value the signal in the calorimeter can be detected confidently at the particle energy greater than 3 GeV. The energy resolution for the 9 EM cells in the case of no electronic noise is

\[\frac{\sigma}{A}=\frac{31\pm 2}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus(9.5\pm 1.0).\]

The corresponding noise term from the expression (9) is determined from the data at the fixed parameters A and B in the energy range of (3-150) GeV. The fitted C values and d-parameters from expression (10) are presented in Table 4 for two methods of the amplitude definition.

In fig. 5 and 6 one can see the amplitude distributions for first and second methods of the amplitude definitions. There are no large difference between these two kind of the ditributions in the energy range of the reliable signal detection.

The accuracy of the \(\phi\) and R coordinates definition is determined in the energy range of (9-150) GeV and the fitted parameters from expression (11) are presented in Table 5. The \(P_{T}\) resolution is given in the same form as for pions (12)

\[\frac{|\Delta\vec{P_{T}}|}{P_{T}}=\frac{40}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 5\oplus\frac{C_{1} }{E},\]

\[\frac{\sigma(|\Delta\vec{P_{T}}|)}{P_{T}}=\frac{60}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 7\oplus \frac{C_{2}}{E}.\]

The fitted \(C_{j}\) values are given in Table 6.

### Calorimeter response to jets

The centers of a particle shower in both calorimeter sections are defined in the same way as in the case of a single pion. The signal is observed when in any calorimeter section one or both of these cells \((i,j)\) satisfy condition (7). Due to the cell noise the coordinate definition in one of the sections can be wrong. Therefore, it is necessary to make the shower centers in both sections agree with each other. It is asumed that the shower centers are defined correct in the case of \(L<40\) cm, where L is the distance between these centers in the (X-Y) plane. About 80% and 99% of events fit this condition at the jet energy of E= 100 GeV and E= 800 GeV respectively. In the opposite case, when \(L>40\) cm, in that section where the ratio \(A_{i}/\sigma_{k}\) is least the shower center is considered as the cell \(j\) with the same coordinate as in other calorimeter section. Used the group of cells (9 cells) to find the shower center, there were obtained results which are the same as in the former case (some improvement can be estimated as \(3\%-5\%\) only).

The efficiency of the event selection under the noise environments is presented in fig.1 where the solid curve is the fraction of events detected with the help of condition (7). Another curves are the event registration efficiencies when the chosen cell in EM or HAD sections coincide with or adjacent to the cell chosen in the case of no electronic noise.

According to these data one can conclude that even with the pessimistic noise value the signal in the calorimeter can be detected confidently at the jet energy of 100 GeV which is quite sufficient for the FC. The optimum radius value \(R_{opt}\) around the cell with the maximum energy content is defined by the minimum energy resolution RES (8). In fig.3 one can see dependence of the energy resolution RES on the radius R in the EM and HAD sections for the different amplitude cuts in cells. According to these data the following optimal values of \(R_{opt}\) were chosen:

\[R_{opt}(EM)=44~{}cm~{}~{},~{}~{}R_{opt}(HAD)=36~{}cm.\]

(In the case of the optimistic noise estimation these values can be enlarged by one step-cell). The corresponding number of cells and the detected part of energy are presented in Table 3. For the chosen \(R_{opt}\) the loss of the jet energy equals 15% and 3% at the incident energy of 100 GeV and 800 GeV. The energy resolution for the chosen calorimeter range in the case of no electronic noise is

\[\frac{RES}{A}=\frac{190\pm 15}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus(3.0\pm 0.5).\]

The corresponding noise term from expression (9) is determined from the data at the fixed parameters A and B. The fitted C values are presented in Table 4 for four methods of the amplitude definition together with the d-parameter defined in expression (10). The energy resolution for Method 2 is better than for Method 1 but there is no deviation in the measured amplitude from the true one in Method 1. The obtained C-values are much greater for jets than for pions. It can be explained by the different calibration coefficients for these objects (the relative part of the energy detected in the HAD section is enlarged in the case of jets). In fig. 5 and 6 one can see the amplitude distributions for first and second methods of the amplitude definitions. There are no large difference between these two kind of the distributions in the high energy range.

The accuracy of the \(\phi\) and R coordinates definition is determined in the same manner as for pions (see Table 5). The \(P_{T}\) resolution is given in the same form as for pions (12)

\[\frac{|\Delta\vec{P_{T}}|}{P_{T}}=\frac{79}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 4\oplus\frac{C_{1}}{E},\]

\[\frac{\sigma(|\Delta\vec{P_{T}}|)}{P_{T}}=\frac{54}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3\oplus\frac{C_ {2}}{E}.\]

The fitted \(C_{j}\) values are given in Table 6.

## 3 Conclusion

There were analyzed four methods of the amplitude definition in the FC. For all incoming objects there have been obtained the energy dependence of the average measured amplitudes. Therefore, one can attempt to define the absolute energy calibration taking into account the non-linear response of the FC. These corrected amplitude distributions are fitted with expression (9) where A and B parameters are fixed at the corresponging values. The fitted C parameters are presented in Table 7 for all 4 methods of the amplitude definition in the case of the pessimistic noise estimation. One can see that these new values of C parameter are larger than those in Table 4.

It was observed that Method 2 gives better energy resolution than Method 1. At the same time the amplitude value and the resolution have very strong dependence on the analysed cell number in Method 2. Therefore this method will have more evident dependence on the background content in cells, that is on the radius of the FC. This conclusion can be attributed to other two methods of the amplitude definition (Methods 3 and 4). At the small energy of an incoming object the amplitude distribution has significant assimetry in Method 2 and 4. This effect can be observed in the Method 3 also.

Taking into account that the final difference between four methods is not so large (compare Tables 4 and 7) it seems that Method 1 is more preferable.

## Figure captions.

**Fig.1**: Dependence of the event detection efficiency on the energy of incoming objects under the noise environments (pessimistic estimation, see text) with the help of condition (7):

(a) pions, (b) electrons, (c) jets.

Solid curve(star) - the event fraction when one can find the cell with the energy content greater than cut. Dotted curve(circle) - the event fraction when the shower center defined in the EM section coincide with or adjacent to the cell with maximum energy content in the case of no electronic noise. Dotted curve(triangle) - the event fraction when the shower center defined in the HAD section coincide with or adjacent to the cell with maximum energy content in the case on no electronic noise.
**Fig.2**: (a) Method 1 of the amplitude definition for pions (pessimistic estimation of the electronic noise): \(|A(cell)|>CUT\), where CUT= 0 (top part of the figure) and CUT= \(\sigma_{noise}(cell)\) (bottom part of the figure). Dependence of the energy resolution and normalized amplitude of the signal on the circle radius R in the HAD section around the cell with the maximum energy content for two energy values: 25 GeV - solid curves, 150 GeV - dotted curves. The cell number in the EM section is determined by the following radius: the circle-sign - R(EM)= 28 cm, the box-sign - R(EM)= 20 cm, the triangle-sign - R(EM)= 12 cm.

(b) The same as in fig.2a for method 2 of the amplitide definition: \(A(cell)>\) CUT, where CUT= \(\sigma_{noise}(cell)\) (top part of the figure) and CUT= \(2^{*}\sigma_{noise}(cell)\) (bottom part of the figure).
**Fig.3**: (a) Method 1 of the amplitude definition for jets (pessimistic estimation of the electronoc noise): \(|A(cell)|>\) CUT, where CUT= 0 (top part of the figure) and CUT= \(\sigma_{noise}(cell)\) (bottom part of the figure). Dependence of the energy resolution and normalized amplitude of the signal on the circle radius R in the HAD section around the cell with the maximum energy content for two energy values: 100 GeV - solid curves, 800 GeV - dotted curves. The cell number in the EM section is determined by the following radius: the circle-sign - R(EM)= 52 cm, the box-sign - R(EM)= 44 cm, the triangle-sign - R(EM)= 36 cm.

(b) The same as in fig.2a for method 2 of the amplitide definition:\(A(cell)>\) CUT, where CUT= \(\sigma_{noise}(cell)\) (top part of the figure) and CUT= 2*\(\sigma_{noise}(cell)\) (bottom part of the figure).
**Fig.4**: Dependence of the weight factor \(w_{2}\) on the energy for two methods of the amplitude definition.

Curve 1 = Method 3; curve 2 = Method 4.
