**Detector technologies for LHC experiments**

**Abstract**

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will provide proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV with a design luminosity of \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The exploitation of the rich physics potential is illustrated using the expected performance of the two general-purpose detectors ATLAS and CMS.

The lecture introduces the physics motivation for experiments at the LHC energy. The design parameters and expected performance of the LHC machine are then discussed, followed by the design objectives for the detectors. The technical solutions are presented for each detector system (calorimetry, muon system, inner tracker, trigger). For each system the requirements, the technology choices and the achieved and expected performance are discussed.
