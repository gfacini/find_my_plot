**Prospects for measurement of the top quark mass using \(t\bar{t}\) events with \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays with the upgraded ATLAS detector at the High Luminosity LHC**

The ATLAS Collaboration

This document presents projections for the top quark mass measurement accuracy using \(t\bar{t}\to\) lepton+jets events with \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) in the final state at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) at the High-Luminosity LHC with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions with the ATLAS experiment. A statistical uncertainty of 0.14 GeV is expected, with a systematic uncertainty of 0.48 GeV.

## 1 Introduction

A variety of alternative methods are exploited to supplement the top quark mass (\(m_{\rm top}\)) measurements from direct mass reconstruction based on jet observables. In this note, one example is investigated, namely the measurement of \(m_{\rm top}\) from final states where one of the \(b\)-quarks hadronises into a \(B\) hadron which decays into a \(J/\psi\) meson, which then decays into a muon-antimuon pair. This approach relies on a template method exploiting the top quark mass sensitivity of the invariant mass \(m(\ell\ \mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) of the system made of the \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) meson candidate and the isolated lepton coming from the associated \(W\) boson decay. As this observable involves only three reconstructed leptons, the sensitivity to the light-jet and \(b\)-jet energy scale is expected to be reduced compared to the final states where the observables are based on jet reconstruction. One of the limiting factors of this approach is the small branching fraction, \(\mathcal{B}(t\bar{t}\to(W^{+}b)(W^{-}b)\to(\ell\nu_{\ell}J/\psi(\to\mu^{+}\mu^{- })X)(qq^{\prime}b))\ \sim 4.1\times 10^{-4}\), where \(\ell=e,\mu\). With this technique, the \(b\)-production and the \(b\)-fragmentation are expected to be among the dominating sources of systematic uncertainties. The use of different approaches and observables to measure \(m_{\rm top}\) should help to reduce the uncertainties in a combination of all measurements.

The use of \(t\bar{t}\) events containing \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays to measure the top quark mass has already been considered by both ATLAS and CMS [1, 2, 3]. These analyses are statistically limited, due to the low branching fraction, and thus will benefit from the High-Luminosity (HL) upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the ATLAS detector [4].

Upgrades of the ATLAS detector [5] will be necessary to maintain its performance in the higher luminosity environment1. A new inner tracking system, extending the tracking region from \(|\eta|<2.7\) up to \(|\eta|<4\), will provide the ability to reconstruct charged particles in the forward region, which can be matched to calorimeter clusters for forward electron reconstruction, or associated to forward jets. The inner tracker extension also enables muon identification at high \(\eta\) if additional detectors are installed in the region \(2.7<|\eta|<4\).

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal IP in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r\), \(\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). The transverse momentum and energy are defined as \(p_{\rm T}=p\sin\theta\) and \(E_{\rm T}=E\sin\theta\), respectively. The angular distance \(\Delta R\) is defined as \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\).

This note presents projections for the accuracy of the top quark mass measurement at the HL-LHC, using the \(J/\psi\) decay mode with the full expected luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. In a HL-LHC scenario, both the ATLAS detector and the analysis strategy are expected to change significantly from the Run-2 analysis and it is difficult to make reliable predictions for the systematic uncertainties relevant to the HL-LHC analysis. Following the existing recommendations for the HL-LHC studies [6, 7], a reduction of the \(t\bar{t}\) modelling uncertainties by a factor of two and a reduction of some of the experimental uncertainties by up to a factor two are assumed. As such, the main result of this study is a statistical projection of the measurement. Where possible, the impact of typical sources of systematic uncertainty on the measurement are estimated.

The top quark mass determined in this method corresponds to the mass definition used in the MC simulation. Because of various steps in the event simulation, the mass measured in this way does not necessarily directly coincide with mass definitions within a given renormalization scheme, e.g. the top quark pole mass. Evaluating these differences is a topic of theoretical investigations [8, 9, 10, 11].

## 2 Simulation samples

Samples of simulated events for signal and background processes are produced at 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy. They include the production of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs, single-top quarks and \(W/Z\) bosons in association with jets. Using their theoretically-predicted cross-sections, the MC samples are normalised to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The EvtGen (v1.2.0) [12] program is used to handle the decays of \(b\)- and \(c\)-flavoured hadrons in all samples.

The baseline \(t\bar{t}\) simulation sample is produced using the next-to-leading order (NLO) Powheg-Box (r3026 v2) matrix-element (ME) event generator [13; 14; 15; 16] and the NNPDF3.0 parton distribution function (PDF) set [17]. The parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event are simulated using Pythia 8 (v8.210) [18] with the A14 tune [19] using the NNPDF2.3 PDF set [20] in the parton shower. The number of generated \(t\bar{t}\) events is \(2\times 10^{7}\) for the nominal sample corresponding to a an equivalent luminosity of 37.1 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Samples of single-top quarks corresponding to the \(t\)-channel and \(s\)-channel are generated with Powheg-Box (r3026 v2) and the NNPDF3.0 parton distribution function (PDF). The parton shower, hadronisation and underlying event are simulated using Pythia 8 (v8.210) with the A14 tune using the NNPDF2.3 PDF set in the parton shower. Samples for the \(Wt\) production are generated with Powheg-Box v1 using the CT10 PDF set, interfaced to Pythia 6 with Perugia P2012C tunable parameters. The higher-order overlap with \(t\bar{t}\) production is addressed using the "diagram removal" (DR) generation scheme [21].

In the above mentioned \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top quarks simulation samples, the top quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV. Additional \(t\bar{t}\) samples are generated for different assumed values of \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\), from 169 to 176 GeV, with otherwise unchanged parameters. Single-top quark production samples with different values of \(m_{\mathrm{top}}\) are not available for this analysis.

Detailed descriptions of other samples can be found in Ref. [22].

## 3 Event reconstruction and selection

After the event generation step, a fast simulation of the trigger and detector effects is added with the dedicated ATLAS software framework [23]. The trigger, reconstruction and identification efficiencies, the energy and transverse momentum resolution of leptons and jets are computed as functions of their \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) using full simulation studies assuming an upgraded ATLAS detector. They provide a parameterised estimate of the ATLAS performance at the HL-LHC. These smearing functions are applied to the particle-level quantities. The smearing functions assume the HL-LHC conditions of an instantaneous luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=7.5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and an average number of additional collisions per bunch-crossing of \(<\mu>=200\).

Details of the object selection and the corresponding assumed reconstruction efficiencies and resolutions can be found in Ref. [6].

Electrons and muons are reconstructed in the fiducial region of transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<4\). Identification efficiencies [4] are applied to the lepton candidates to select which particles are identified as leptons. Similarly, isolation efficiencies are applied. The energy, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the \(\eta\) of the lepton candidates are smeared according to the detector resolution. This analysis makes use of additional muon candidates, selected with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold of 4 GeV, to reconstruct \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) candidateswithin jets. These'soft muons' are required to lie within \(|\eta|<4\) and do not have to satisfy isolation requirements.

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [24, 25] implemented in the FastJet package [26], with a radius parameter of 0.4. Jets are accepted if they have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<4.5\). Double counting of electrons as jets may arise from electron energy deposition in the calorimeter being clustered by the jet algorithm. To mitigate such effects, jets are removed if within \(\Delta R=0.2\) of a selected electron. After this step, electrons within \(\Delta R=0.4\) from a jet are rejected, since they are considered as decay products of the hadrons in the jet. For the same reason, isolated muons that are within \(\Delta R=0.04+(10\GeV/p_{\mathrm{T}})\) from a jet are also removed. A fraction of the particle-level jets are removed, according to the expected jet reconstruction efficiency [6]. The energy, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) of remaining jets are smeared according to the detector resolution. Pile-up jets are rejected using tracking information.

Fake leptons are obtained from functions parametrising the expected level of light-jet to electron fake rate and the level of muon fake rate. Fake electrons are introduced according to the probability that a jet is misidentified as an electron as measured in full simulation, where the jet can come from the hard scattering vertex or from the pile-up. When a jet is reconstructed as an electron its energy is changed accordingly.

The event selection follows the analysis done at 8 [1], except for the increased \(\eta\) acceptance of leptons and jets. Events are required to have at least one charged isolated lepton with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<4\) and at least 4 jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<4.5\). No requirement is applied on the number of \(b\)-tagged jets. Figure 1 shows the distributions of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading jet, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the isolated lepton and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) of the soft muons.

\(J/\psi\) candidates are reconstructed using all pairs of opposite charge sign soft muons. The two muon tracks are not refitted to a common vertex to form a \(J/\psi\). Figure 2(a) shows the invariant mass distributions of the dimuon pairs with an invariant mass value below 20. A peak around the \(J/\psi\) mass is clearly visible. More than \(6\times 10^{6}\) dimuon pairs remain at this level.

Only events with \(J/\psi\) candidates in the mass range [3.0;3.2] are retained. To reduce combinatoric background, only events with exactly one \(J/\psi\) candidate in this mass range are kept. Finally, further selection criteria are applied. At least one of the two muons is required to be within a distance \(\Delta R<0.5\) from a jet. The angular distance between the two soft muons must be \(\Delta R<0.8\). The transverse momentum of the \(J/\psi\) candidate must be \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>8\GeV\). The transverse decay length of the \(J/\psi\) candidate must be \(L_{\mathrm{xy}}>0\) mm, with \(L_{\mathrm{xy}}=\frac{\vec{L}\vec{p_{\mathrm{T}}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\) where \(\vec{L}\) is the vector of the distance between the primary vertex and the extrapolated common vertex of the two soft muon candidates in the transverse plane, and \(\vec{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\) is the reconstructed transverse momentum vector of the dimuon candidate.

Figure 2(b) shows the distribution of the invariant mass of the \(2\times 10^{5}\) candidates, after the final selection, corresponding to an event rate of about 70 events per \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at 14. Due to the higher cross-section and despite possible losses due to trigger conditions and the increase of the pile-up, the amount of expected events is about 18% higher at 14 than at 13. Furthermore, because of the increase of the \(\eta\) coverage with the ATLAS HL-LHC detector to \(|\eta|<4\) for leptons an extra increase of about 10% of events is expected compared to the Run-2 analysis.

Figure 1: Distributions of (a) \(p_{\rm T}\) of the leading jet and (b) \(p_{\rm T}\) of the isolated lepton in events with one isolated lepton and at least four jets, (c) \(p_{\rm T}\) and (d) \(\eta\) of the soft muons in these events. Expectations are obtained from simulation, broken down into contributions from \(t\bar{t}\), single-top, \(W\)+jets, \(Z\)+jets and events with non-prompt and fake leptons (referred to as ‘NP & Fake Lep.’). The shaded area represents the combination of MC statistical uncertainties and systematic uncertainties on cross-sections. The rightmost bin contains all entries with values above the lower edge of this bin.

## 4 Measurement of the top quark mass

### The template method

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the invariant mass \(m(\ell\ \mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) of the system made of the \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) meson candidate and the isolated lepton. The top quark mass can be measured in the selected events by using the sensitivity of \(m(\ell\ \mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) to \(m_{\rm top}\). In the template method, probability density functions are constructed from all signal and background MC simulated samples. They are obtained for different \(m_{\rm top}\) values using \(t\bar{t}\) samples generated at different top quark mass values: 169, 170, 171, 172, 172.25, 172.5, 173, 174, 175 and 176. Appropriate functions are fitted to these templates, interpolating between different input \(m_{\rm top}\). The parameters of the functions are fixed by a simultaneous fit to all templates, imposing linear dependences of the parameters on \(m_{\rm top}\). The resulting template fit function has \(m_{\rm top}\) as the only free parameter and an unbinned likelihood maximisation gives the value of \(m_{\rm top}\) that best describes the data. The choosen analytical function is the sum of a Gaussian and a Gamma function. Figure 4 shows the templates obtained for different \(m_{\rm top}\) input values, overlaid with the corresponding probability density function from the fit. It shows the sensitivity of the templates to the input \(m_{\rm top}\) value, the knowledge of which is currently limited by the low number of MC simulated events.

Figure 2: Distributions of the invariant mass of the dimuon candidates (a) in the mass range [0;20] after the selection of soft muons and (b) in the mass range [3.0;3.2] after the full selection. Expectations are obtained from simulation, broken down into contributions from \(t\bar{t}\), single-top, \(W\)+ jets, \(Z\)+jets and events with non-prompt and fake leptons (referred to as ‘NP & Fake Lep.’). The shaded area represents the combination of MC statistical uncertainties and systematic uncertainties on cross-sections.

The shaded area represents the combination of MC statistical uncertainties and systematic uncertainties on cross-sections. The rightmost bin contains all entries with values above the lower edge of this bin.

### Uncertainties affecting the \(m_{\text{top}}\) determination

Due to the changes of the detector performance for the HL-LHC, it is difficult to estimate precisely the effects of systematic uncertainties. The sources of uncertainty are assumed to be the same as the current ones. Systematic uncertainties are estimated by varying each source of uncertainty and determining the impact on the mass measurement.

The residual difference between fitted and generated \(m_{\text{top}}\) when analysing a template from a MC sample reflects the potential bias of the method. A constant is fitted to the observed \(m_{\text{top}}\) residuals. This constant and its statistical uncertainty is assigned as the method uncertainty. This also covers effects from limited numbers of simulated events in the templates and potential deficiencies in the template parameterizations.

The signal modelling uncertainties of the \(t\bar{t}\) physics processes concern the choices of the \(t\bar{t}\) NLO generator, the parton shower and hadronisation model, the modelling of heavy-flavour production (hereafter \(b\)-production) in \(t\bar{t}\) events, the \(b\)-fragmentation parameters, the modelling of initial- and final-state radiation, the underlying event and the colour reconnection effects. The \(b\)-production uncertainty originates from the effect of the uncertainties on the production fractions for different species of \(b\)-hadrons as well as the uncertainties on the branching fractions of the decays of \(b\)-hadrons to \(J/\psi\), which likely will affect the kinematics of the \(J/\psi\). The \(b\)-fragmentation uncertainty is assessed through a re-tune of the Pythia 8 parameters to describe the \(b\)-quark fragmentation function measured at LEP. All these uncertainties are evaluated from simulated events using different generators or tuning.

The background modelling uncertainties are related to the uncertainties on the shape and normalisation of the fake soft muons, the fake isolated leptons and other background processes.

The \(t\bar{t}\) signal and background modelling uncertainties are measured in the preliminary Soft Muon Tagger analysis at 13 TeV, and are taken as suitable estimates for the \(J/\psi\) analysis.

Experimental uncertainties arise from the modelling and calibration of the ATLAS detector response, affecting the performance of the event selection and the final state reconstruction. This measurement essentially relies on lepton reconstruction, especially on the reconstruction of muons, and is therefore susceptible to uncertainties on the lepton energy scales, resolution and reconstruction efficiencies. As \(m(\ell\ \mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) involves only three reconstructed leptons, the sensitivity to the light-jet and \(b\)-jet energy scale (JES/\(b\)-JES) as well as to the jet energy resolution (JER) is expected to be reduced compared to observables based on reconstructed jets.

### Extrapolation scenario

The estimated Run-2 uncertainties are scaled to align with HL-LHC extrapolations developed by the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations and documented in Ref. [6; 7].

The theory modelling uncertainties are expected to be reduced by a factor two compared to existing values. The larger HL-LHC dataset will allow for generator tuning, as already started with Run-2 data [27], and smaller uncertainties based on the measurements of different kinematic distributions. The \(b\)-fragmentation parameters are expected to be measured directly in the LHC data, leading to a tuning of current generators to get a better match to data and smaller associated uncertainty.

The impact of the experimental systematic uncertainties will likely be reduced relative to their effect on the Run-2 analysis given the large datasets available, allowing precise performance studies to be conducted.

The jet reconstruction uncertainties on \(m_{\rm top}\) are expected to be reduced by a factor up to two, while uncertainties related to the reconstruction of electrons and muons remain the same as in Run-2.

### Results

The projections for the accuracy of the top quark mass measurement using the \(J/\psi\) decay mode with the full expected luminosity of 3000 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) are detailed in Table 1.

A statistical uncertainty of 0.14 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) is expected, with a method uncertainty of 0.11 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\).

From preliminary studies using the Run-2 dataset, the dominant signal modelling uncertainties are related to the \(t\bar{t}\)\(b\)-production and \(t\bar{t}\)\(b\)-fragmentation. These uncertainties are expected to be respectively 0.24 and 0.11 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). Other \(t\bar{t}\) modelling uncertainties are expected to be below 0.1 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) each.

With the level of background being small, the background modelling uncertainties are expected to be 0.10 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c} \hline \hline Source of uncertainty & \(\sigma(m_{\rm top})\) [\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\)] \\ \hline \hline Statistical uncertainty & 0.14 \\ Method uncertainty & 0.11 \\ \hline
**Signal modelling uncertainties** & \\ \(t\bar{t}\) NLO modelling & 0.06 \\ \(t\bar{t}\) PS and hadronisation & 0.05 \\ \(t\bar{t}\)\(b\)-production & 0.24 \\ \(t\bar{t}\)\(b\)-fragmentation & 0.11 \\ Initial- and final-state radiation & 0.04 \\ Underlying event & 0.02 \\ Colour reconnection & 0.02 \\ \hline Background modelling uncertainties & 0.10 \\ \hline
**Experimental uncertainties** & \\ Jet energy scale (JES) & 0.31 \\ \(b\)-jet energy scale (\(b\)-JES) & 0.06 \\ Jet energy resolution (JER) & 0.13 \\ Jet vertex fraction & 0.02 \\ Electrons & 0.03 \\ Muons & 0.09 \\ Pile-up & 0.04 \\ \hline Total Systematic uncertainty & 0.48 \\ \hline Total & 0.50 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The contributions of the various sources to the uncertainty on \(m_{\rm top}\) using \(m(\ell\ \mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) templates, extrapolated to an integrated luminosity of 3000 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) with a center-of-mass energy of 14 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). The last line refers to the sum in quadrature of the statistical and systematic uncertainties.

The experimental uncertainties are expected to be 0.36. They are dominated by the uncertainties related to the JES (0.31 ) and the JER (0.13 ). Presently, the evaluation of both uncertainties still suffers from large statistical uncertainties. The uncertainties related to the muon reconstruction are expected to be 0.09.

Finally, the total systematic uncertainty is expected to be 0.48.

A total of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of 14 data would clearly decrease the statistical uncertainty in this analysis so that the precision would be limited by systematic effects. Therefore, the statistical precision could be traded in various ways for a reduced total systematic uncertainty by cutting into phase space regions where the systematic uncertainties are high.

## 5 Conclusion

The top quark mass measurement using lepton+jets events with in the final state is presented. Based on studies with a 13 dataset, projections for the measurement accuracy at the High-Luminosity LHC using the full expected luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at are derived. A statistical uncertainty of 0.14 is expected, with a systematic uncertainty of 0.48.
