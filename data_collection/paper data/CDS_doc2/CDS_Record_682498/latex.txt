Motivation

The search for lepton number violation is motivated by the fact that there is no known symmetry associated with leptonic quantum numbers and, therefore, there is no reason why lepton flavour should be conserved. Studies of the Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) and in particular of their supersymmetric versions has shown explicit mechanisms of lepton flavour violation [1][2][3]. For example, a version of the SO(5) Supersymmetric Standard Model (SMSM), discussed by J. Hisano et al. [4], contains three families of right-handed neutrinos and the Yukawa coupling of these neutrinos generates off-diagonal entries in the mass matrices for sleptons through renormalization effects. These in turn lead to lepton flavour violation. A number of similar models can be found in the literature. Most of them contain Yukawa couplings that are mass dependent and the calculated rate is strongly enhanced for the \(\tau\to\mu\gamma\) decay as compared to the well studied process \(\mu\to e\gamma\). This enhancement factor depends on the specific model and is typically equal to \(\frac{m_{\tau}^{2}}{m_{\pi}^{2}}\times\frac{m_{\tau}^{2}}{m_{\tau}^{2}}\approx 1.2\times 10^{7}\). The expected rates of lepton number violating processes depend on the specific model and are typically a factor of 50 to 1000 below the present experimental bounds. Thus, searches for such processes provide an interesting alternative to the direct searches for new physics at very high energies and provide complementary information limiting Standard Model extensions.

The present experiment al situation of searches for lepton number violating processes can be summarized as follows:

* Numerically, the best upper limit has been obtained for \(\mu\to e\gamma\) transitions in nuclear targets. The limit is \(B(\mu\to e\gamma)<4.9\times 10^{-11}\)[5]. New experiments aiming to improve the sensitivity by about an order of magnitude are proposed at the Los Alamos and BNL laboratories.
* The best upper limit for \(\tau\) decays with lepton flavour violation comes from the CLEO experiment and is \(B(\tau\to\mu\gamma)<3.0\times 10^{-6}\)[6].

The LHC machine, even at low luminosity, is a prolific source of \(\tau\) production. The aim of this study is to check whether the search for \(\tau\to\mu\gamma\) decays is feasible in the ATLAS experiment and whether the attainable result is competitive with future CLEO III and B-factory experiments which should provide about an order of magnitude improvement over the present limit.

## 2 Signal characteristics and rates

There are many sources of \(\tau\) production within the Standard Model at the LHC :

* W decays : \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\),
* Z decays : \(Z\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\),
* semileptonic and leptonic decays of heavy quarks, e.g. \(B\to\tau\nu_{\tau}X\),
* annihilation processes with virtual photon decays \(\gamma^{*}\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\),
* Higgs decays, e.g. \(H\to 4\tau\).

In addition, each of the parent particles that decays into a tau can be obtained in several different production processes. Among those listed above, the largest \(\tau\) production rate at high transverse momentum appears to be due to W production via the Drell-Yan process with subsequent W decay to tau and its neutrino: \(q\overline{q}\to W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\). The estimated cross section for this process is \(\sigma\times Br=14.8\) nb and corresponds to about \(1.5\times 10^{8}\) events produced per year at low LHC luminosity.

The signal \(\tau\to\mu\gamma\) decay can be identified by requiring that the invariant mass of the muon and the photon be equal to that of the tau mass, \(M(\mu\gamma)=m_{\tau}\). To estimate the characteristics of the signal a simple simulation of the two body decay of the \(\tau\) into a muon and a photon was appended to the PYTHIA [7] generated file of \(W\to\tau\nu\) decays. The W bosons were produced via the Drell-Yan process and spherical symmetry of the decay \(\tau\to\mu\gamma\) in the \(\tau\) rest-frame was assumed. The muon momentum was smeared using the ATLFAST [8] subroutine RESMUO for the low luminosity LHC running. This smearing assumed that the polar and azimuthal emission angles of the muon are well measured in the ATLAS inner detector and therefore that only the momentum and the energy of the muon are affected. Similarly, the photon energy was smeared using the subroutine RESPHO and the assumption was made that the photon direction can be well measured using the vertex information from the extrapolated muon track.

The geometrical acceptance and trigger conditions were simulated by requiring :

* \(|\eta|<2.5\) for both the muon and the photon
* \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV/c,
* \(E_{T}(\gamma)>20\) GeV.

Initially, the above cuts were required to be fulfilled by either the muon or the photon with a transverse momentum above the minimum value. The corresponding distributions of muon and photon transverse moment a, their invariant mass and the separation variable

\[\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\]

are shown in Figures 1 - 4. About 35% of the signal events satisfy the selection criteria.

Subsequent studies of the dominating radiative backgrounds (discussed in the following section) have shown the necessity of introducing additional cuts. The final signal selection requires both \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV/c and \(E_{T}(\gamma)>20\) GeV to be satisfied simultaneously. In addition, the radiative background from \(W\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\) decays is dominated by high \(p_{T}\) muons while the muon spectrum from the radiative \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\nu_{\tau}\) decays is significantly softer. These backgrounds can be minimized by selecting events with a muon momentum in the range 10 GeV/c \(<p_{T}(\mu)<20\) GeV/c. Finally, an optimum background rejection using the separation variable was found for \(\Delta R>0.08\).

The final signal selection efficiency of 5.4% would yield \(8\times 10^{6}\)\(\tau\) decays per year at low LHC luminosity. The rms of the momentum resolution for the selected muons (resp. photons) is 1.3 % (resp. 1.4 %). The reconstructed \(\tau\) mass for the selected events is centred on the input value with a mass resolution of 20 MeV/c\({}^{2}\) (see Figure 1). This resolution is comparable to and even slightly better than the CLEO detector resolution of 25 MeV.

## 3 Backgrounds

There are many background processes resulting in a high transverse momentum muon and a photon :* Heavy-quark pair production with subsequent semileptonic decay of one of the quarks to a muon,
* Final state radiation in W decays to a muon, \(W\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\gamma\),
* Final state radiation in W decays to a tau with subsequent tau decay to a muon \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\gamma\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\nu_{\tau}\gamma\),
* Radiative W production followed by W decay to a muon: \[qq^{\prime}\to\gamma W\to\gamma\mu\nu_{\mu},\]
* Radiative W production followed by W decay to a tau and by tau decay to a muon: \[qq^{\prime}\to\gamma W\to\gamma\tau\,\nu_{\tau}\to\gamma\mu\nu_{\mu}\nu_{\tau}.\]

Heavy-quark pair production leads to significantly different topologies than those expected for the signal. These types of background can be eliminated without a large loss of signal efficiency by requiring that no additional large transverse momentum jet is reconstructed in the event. Additional work is nevertheless needed to check the effect of the jet veto.

The final-state radiation effects have similar characteristics but differ in relative rates:

* The W production with subsequent decay \(W\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\) has a cross section of \(14.8\) nb,
* The W production with subsequent decay \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\) followed by \(\tau\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\) has lower cross section due to the \(17\%\)\(\tau\to\mu\nu_{\tau}\) branching fraction, i.e. \(2.51\) nb,
* The radiative W production (PYTHIA process 20) with subsequent decay \(W\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\) has a cross section of \(0.133\) nb,
* The radiative W production (PYTHIA process 20) with W decay to \(\tau\) followed by the \(\tau\) decay to a muon is further suppressed by the \(\tau\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\nu_{\tau}\) branching fraction and has a small cross section of \(0.02\) nb. It has been neglected in the following analysis.

We investigated the radiative background rejection by studying the \(\mu\gamma\) invariant mass distribution as a function of kinematical cuts on \(E_{T}(\gamma)\), \(p_{T}(\mu)\) and \(\Delta R\). We used PYTHIA to generate specific background processes and the PHOTOS [9] package to generate final state QED radiation :

* Drell-Yan W production with \(W\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\) decay and with final state radiation. This is the most copious background to the signal. In order to minimize the amount of computing time we performed the study in two steps: First, we checked on a small sample of \(10^{5}\) events that for the events fulfilling the trigger selection criteria, the number of entries in the region of low invariant mass, \(M(\mu\gamma)<5\;\mbox{GeV}\), and the shapes of the momenta distributions for particles contributing to this region, are the same with and without the underlying event. Next, we used a larger sample of \(1.2\times 10^{7}\) events generated without the underlying event to study correlations between the kinematical variables. The distributions of the muon transverse momentum, transverse energy of the photon and \(\Delta R\) are plotted in Figs. 2-4 (dashed lines). The final selection of cuts:* 10 GeV/c \(<p_{T}(\mu)<\) 20 GeV/c,
* \(E_{T}(\gamma)>\) 20 GeV,
* \(\Delta R>0.08\), was established by comparing these distributions with the corresponding ones for the signal. For the final cuts there are no background events remaining in the tau mass region defined as \(\pm 2\) standard deviations around \(m_{\tau}\).
* Final state radiation in the process \(W\rightarrow\tau\,\nu_{\tau}\) with \(\tau\rightarrow\mu\,\nu_{\mu}\). This appears to be the most troublesome background. Although the transverse momentum spectra of the muon and the photon, shown in Figures 2 and 3 are similar to that of the direct radiative W decay to a muon there is a much stronger overlap of the background and the signal in the distribution of \(\Delta R\). Here again, the PYTHIA and PHOTOS packages were used to generate a sample of \(10^{7}\) events. For the final set of cuts we find a remaining background of 7 events within \(\pm\) 2 standard deviations around \(m_{\tau}\). The mass distribution of this background is illustrated in Figure 5. These events correspond to an overall background from this process of 17 events expected for one year of low luminosity operation.
* Radiative W production. PYTHIA process 20 was used to generate \(10^{6}\) events of radiative W production with the subsequent decay to a muon and a neutrino. Initial and final state radiation were included in the generation. These background events were then passed through the same selection criteria as the signal events. No events with mass smaller than 2 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) survived the selection criteria. In order to normalize this Monte Carlo to the luminosity expected in one year of the LHC running we assumed a flat mass distribution of this background and estimated that 0.1 event may contribute to the \(\tau\) mass region.

## 4 Extraction of limits

The radiative background is dominated by W decays to tau and is estimated to contribute a total of about 17 events/year to the region with \(M(\mu\gamma)=m_{\tau}\). These events provide the limiting factor for the discovery of neutrinoless tau decays. With the assumption of linear mass dependance of the background near the \(\tau\) mass, this background can be estimated with better accuracy by using mass sidebands which contain 10 times more statistics. The averaged expected limit in absence of signal and including total background substraction, has been derived using a prescription described in [10]. For the process \(W\rightarrow\tau\,\nu\rightarrow\mu\nu\gamma\) at 90 % CL the excluded cross section is 16 fb (resp. 8.6 fb) for one year (resp. three years) of LHC running at low luminosity. This can be translated to a 90 % CL upper limit on the branching ratio \(B(\tau\rightarrow\mu\gamma)\) of \(1\times 10^{-6}\) (resp. \(0.6\times 10^{-6}\)) 1.

Footnote 1: A naive calculation considering the 90 % CL discovery limit obtained when the number of signal events is equal to 2.3 \(\sqrt{\mbox{\it background}}\) would have led to a 1.3\(\times 10^{-6}\) upper limit.

As a cross check, a separate study was done using PYTHIA to generate the radiative backgrounds. Although the inclusive transverse momentum spectra for the muon and the photon appear to be very similar, a strong difference was observed in the angular correlations among them reflecting on average in larger values of \(\Delta R\). However, a new cut optimization procedure leading to the following selection requirements :* \(6\;{\rm GeV}/{\rm c}<p_{T}(\mu)<15\;{\rm GeV}/{\rm c}\),
* \(E_{T}(\gamma)>20\;{\rm GeV}\),
* \(0.07<\Delta R<0.16\),

resulted in a somewhat larger efficiency but similar size of the background and a similar discovery limit of for the lepton number violating \(\tau\) decay.

## 5 Conclusions

The search for the lepton-number violating decay \(\tau\to\mu\gamma\) is background limited at the LHC. The expected sensitivity can reach a branching fraction upper limit of about \(1\times 10^{-6}\) in one year of running at low luminosity. Such an upper limit is only a factor 3 better than the current CLEO result. It should be emphasised that the simulation methods used in this study are quite simplistic : the muon momentum smearing and photon energy resolution approximations are rudimentary and no corrections were made for the tracking and photon finding efficiencies; more detailed studies of pile-up effects at higher luminosity are needed to pursue this subject further. The loss of efficiency for jet veto also needs to be checked in more detail. All these are likely to have small but weakening effects on the upper limit. We conclude, therefore, that ATLAS sensitivity for this analysis will be similar to that expected at the B factories.
