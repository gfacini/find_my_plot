## 1 Introduction

In this note we present a first estimate for the momentum resolution of different inner trackergeometries for Eagle. The resolutions are calculated for 1 TeV tracks in a constant 2T solenoidal field. No attention has been paid to the effects of running at high luminosity, nor have material effects (such as multiple scattering and electron Bremsstrahlung) been taken into account. The detectors do not always have exactly the same parameters as in the presentations to the inner tracker meetings. Approximations have been made in the description of the layout, and all detectors have been assumed to be 100 % efficient. Technical problems for the construction of the detectors presented here have been happily overlooked and left to the technicians. So, the figures presented are only a first guess and serve merely to judge how the different options compare.

**The momentum resolutions are calculated by a least squares fit to a helix passing through the measurements.** _A priori_ knowledge of the transverse vertex coordinates is assumed with a precision of 20 \(\mu m\). This fit is linear given small angle approximations which are valid above a few GeV for the Eagle tracker dimensions. The magnetic field deflects a track in the \(r\phi\) plane, and the measurement precision in this projection propagates essentially to the error on the momentum component perpendicular to the plane. An arrangement of cylindrical detectors concentric with respect to the beam axis (i.e. \(r\phi\) measurements at fixed radii) will measure 1/\(p_{z}\), whereas forward disk chambers at fixed \(z\)-coordinates measure 1/\(p_{z}\). Measurements of the orthogonal component are then needed to determine the track slope in the \(rz\) projection and thus the magnitude of \(p\). In

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

this orthogonal direction a rather modest precision of around 1 cm is sufficient, since uncertainties in \(r\phi\) and multiple scattering errors dominate the momentum resolution1. For this study we are only concerned with the position, orientation and \(r\phi\) precision of the tracking layers. Their resolutions in the orthogonal coordinates are assumed to be sufficiently precise that any contribution to the momentum resolution can be neglected. Systematic errors due to misalignment are partially taken into account by increasing the \(r\phi\) errors.

Footnote 1: However higher precision in the \(rz\)-plane will be needed for pattern recognition at high luminosity (space point matching), for z-vertex association and accurate \(\eta\)measurement.

## 2 Conceptual tracker layout

Theinnertrackershould provide a precise curvature measurement of charged particles in order to:

* distinguish the sign of charge of electrons up to the highest produced momenta (thei energy will be more precisely measured by the calorimeter);
* identify electrons from the correspondence between the momentum measured in the tracker and the energy deposited in the calorimeter;
* complement the toroid measurement of muon momenta (in particular to provide higher precision at low momenta for muons from a virtual \(Z^{\parallel}\) below the real \(Z^{\parallel}\) mass).

These requirements are essentially satisfied provided a momentum precision (\(\Delta p/p\)) somewhat better than 50% at 1 TeV can be achieved (remembering that since the track sagitta is inversely proportional to \(p_{t}\), \(\Delta p/p\) will be directly proportional to \(p_{t}\) for a given layout, ignoring multiple scattering etc.).

A radial space of about 110 cm is available for tracking inside the Eagle Electromagnetic Calorimeter and solenoidal magnet. A charged particle will have a sagitta of \(0.3Br^{2}/8p_{t}\) (with units of Tesla, metres and GeV), which corresponds to about 90 \(\mu m\) at 1 TeV transverse momentum in a 2T field. Thus, a sagitta measurement precision of better than 45 \(\mu m\) will be required.

For a classical three point measurement of a circular trajectory with measurement precision \(\epsilon\) at the start and endpoints and a more precise \(\epsilon/\sqrt{2}\) at the midpoint, the error on the sagitta equals \(\epsilon\). Conceptually this could be obtained from the arrangement sketched in figure 1a, where the shaded areas represent the locations of the three measurement detectors. Of course, these detectors would measure track vectors rather than single points to enable pattern recognition in a multi track environment. For this setup the'sagitta' detector would need to provide a better than 30 \(\mu m\) measurement accuracy, and all three detectors would need to be aligned to within a similar precision.

Figure 2: a) The field integral (’BL’) for Eagle. The solid line gives the field integral for an ideal 2T field; the dotted line was obtained using the Saclay field map for the \(r=120\) cm coil option. The difference between the two cases is 12% for \(\eta>2\). In the rest of the note we use the ideal field approximation. b) The same quantity divided by \(\sin\theta\), which defines the precision of a momentum measurement.

**In practice a realistic outer detector at around \(r=100\) cm can be expected to provide between 40 and 60 \(\mu m\) precision (including alignment errors) and around 15 \(\mu m\) seems to be attainable from an inner detector. The high radiation level at small \(r\) forces the inner detector outwards, but the transverse vertex position, once determined, is expected to remain stable to about 20 \(\mu m\). Using these precision assumptions we can make a global estimate for \(\Delta p/p\) as a function of the position of the middle measurement, as shown in fig. 1b. It can be seen that any radius between 20 and 60 cm will give an acceptable performance. Positioning this detector around \(r=30\) cm will be the optimal choice, because that way we reduce the sensitivity to large errors in the outer measurement, and the number of channels will be minimal. This leads to the attractive possibility of combining the vertex and sagitta measurements in one detector, by extending this track vector inwards to \(r<20\) cm. This will enable a precise determination of the beam spot and give an impact parameter to heavy flavour physics.**

**Another question arises in the forward direction, where an acceptance out to \(\eta=3\) is desirable e.g. for Higgs searches. The length available for tracking is 8 metres, which implies a 'corner' at \(\eta=2.0\), past which particles leave the tracking volume before reaching the full 110 cm radius. Their deflection, hence the transverse momentum precision, is proportional to the double integral of the field with respect to the distance traversed perpendicular to the field direction. (This is just \(Br^{2}/2\) for a perfect solenoid with constant field \(B=(0,0,B_{:})\) everywhere.) This quantity is plotted in fig. 2a as a function of \(\eta\). However for heavy mass decay products a more fair comparison is the behaviour of \(\Delta p/p\) at a fixed momentum i.e. the deflection divided by sin\(\theta\), as shown in fig. 2b. It can be seen that this effective field integral improves with increasing \(\eta\), until the geometrical corner at \(\eta=2\) where the particles start losing on radial track length. Still, the 1/sin\(\theta\) term keeps the integral above the level at \(\eta=0\) out to a rapidity of around 3. So any loss of momentum precision at \(\eta<3\) is a consequence of inappropriately placed detectors.**

## 3 Three possible layouts

### The Reference Tracker

**The Reference Tracker consists of three distinct parts : the Football, the Outer Silicon Detector, and the Forward Tracker (see fig. 3a). GaAsrings can be added to improve pattern recognition and momentum resolution at very forward angles (2.5 \(<\eta<\) 3).**

* **The Football**
* **The tracker closest to the interaction point is an approximation of the Silicon Vertex Tracker as presented by Michal Turala at the inner detector meeting of January 20, 1992 (seetransparencies [GEN-TR-106]). It consists of threeFigure 3: a) The Reference Tracker with GaAs rings; b) The corresponding momentum resolution with GaAs (solid line) and without (dotted line).

superlayers of a "cone" shape rather than the more rounded shape which he presented. The inner and outer radii plus the lengths correspond to the numbers given in his talk. The superlayers however, do not consist of two layers of wafers with strips in different orientations, but are approximated by one single layer of wafers with a resolution of 20 \(\mu\)m in \(r\phi\).
* The Outer Silicon Detector The three layers of Silicon detectors in the barrel at radii up to one meter are a very free extrapolation of what could come out of the RD2 SIT project. The two layers in a superlayer have been approximated by a single layer with \(r\phi\) resolution of 60 \(\mu m\). In the Reference Detector room has been reserved for 10 cm of moderator in front of the calorimeter. The three detector planes are at radii 70, 85 and 100 cm. All planes extend up to \(z\)=125 cm.
* The Forward Tracker Thirteen wheels with Micro Strip Gas Counters (MSGCs) have been positioned at \(z\)-values of 135, 145, 155, 170, 185, 205, 225, 250, 275, 305, 335, 365, and 394 cm. Some free space has been left between the Outer Silicon and the Forward Tracker for cables. The wheels have an inner radius of 40 cm and an outer of 100 cm. The MSGCs have radially positioned strips of 10 cm long with a strip pitch of around 200 \(\mu m\). An \(r\phi\) precision of 60 \(\mu m\) has been assumed for each wheel.
* The GaAs Detector Inspired by the presentation of Terry Sloan at the inner tracker meeting of January 20, 1992 claiming that GaAs can stand almost any radiation level, detector wheels were designed to sit at very small radii (\(r\)=15-25 cm) at \(z\)-values of 90, 120 and 170 cm. Asthey were presented by Terry they consist of strips with small angle stereo radially positioned around the beam pipe. We assume an \(r\phi\) precision of 20 \(\mu m\) for each wheel in our program. The positions along the beam were calculated to have at least one hit in the GaAs Detector for any stiff track between rapidity 2 and 3. It may be desirable to increase the number of these detectors for pattern recognition purposes since at \(\eta>2\) the tracks miss the Football and are only measured by the Forward Detector.

### The TRD Tracker

In this setup (shown in fig. 4a) the Football and the Outer Silicon are the same as for the Reference Tracker except that the radii for the Outer Silicon layers are now 97, 103 and 109 cm to leave space for the TRD on the inside; this Outer Silicon geometry can only be realised if the moderator is not needed in this setup (because of the neutron moderating power of the TRD), in any case it will leave Figure 4: a) The TRD setup (Eagle-B); b) The corresponding momentum resolution with GaAs (solid line) and without (dotted line).

## 4 Momentum resolutions

**In Figures 3-5 each time in a) the setup is drawn and in b) the resolution for 1 TeV tracks. For comparison the resolutions are drawn twice: with and without the GaAs detectors. The spread in the resolution originates from the spread in the position of the vertex. The program varies the vertex position from -14 cm to +14 cm, corresponding to 2.5 \(\sigma\) with \(\sigma\)=5.6 cm from the origin and displays the worst and the best value for the resolution. The worst values should reveal cracks, especially between the barrel and forward detectors.**

* **The setup with the best resolution is the TRD setup. This is not because of the TRD but mainly because the outer tracker devices are extended to a larger radius. The same improvement between \(\eta\)=0 and \(\eta\)=1 could be achieved in the other setups by removing the moderator and by pushing the Outer Silicon to larger radii, or by replacing the moderator by an active devices such as a Scintillating Fiber Detector.**
* **In all three setups it is clear that the GaAs detectors greatly improve the resolution for \(2.5<\eta<3\). The situation could probably still be improved. The present situation is optimized not only for resolution, but also for price. GaAs is quite expensive!**
* **For now systematic effects have been crudely taken into account by increasing** \(r\phi\) **errors as thought appropriate. This will surely require revision when mechanical details of the overall detector support structure become available.**Figure 5: a) The Hollow Tracker; b) The corresponding momentum resolution with GaAs (solid line) and without (dotted line).
