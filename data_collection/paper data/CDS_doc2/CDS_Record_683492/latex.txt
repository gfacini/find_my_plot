**Abstract**

The aim of this note is to describe the procedure used to calculate the geometrical acceptance for the MDT muon spectrometer in ATLAS.

Introduction

The requirement of knowing geometrical acceptance values is deeply connected to the refinement of the muon-spectrometer final design.

Due to the wide angular coverage and the modular, multiplane structure of the MDT chambers, it is mandatory to know geometrical acceptance variations when:

a) the design itself is changed to satisfy apparatus general optimization criteria.

b) new inefficiences are added to take into account crossing of service connections coming from the inner part of the detector.

c) the structures supporting the detector are taken into account.

The detector layout simulated in this work is an evolution with respect to the one presented in the Technical Proposal (TP) at the end of last year, including all recent modifications.

The geometrical description is simulated using CAD systems and translated into a technical database which is suited to describe the dimensions and positions of all muon chambers in the ATLAS muon spectrometer.

This description can be easily used to describe the chamber geometry in the GEANT framework; such a program will be then used to calculate the acceptance of the spectrometer. The advantage offered by this approach consists in the close relation between design and simulation work.

Another feature of this program is the capability to have a 3D interactive view, allowing the display of specific apparatus parts if needed.

In section 2 the updated version of the \(\mu\) spectrometer layout together with the

Figure 2: _Transverse view of the barrel muon detector layout (from CAD)_

naming conventions is presented. In section 3 the database structure is described for both endcap and barrel regions. This database describes the basic structure. It also includes those asymmetries and anomalies due to the magnets and their supports and to service connections as presently known. In section 4 the features of the simulation program are presented and in section 5 results of this study are shown and discussed.

## 2 Detector Layout

To flag the different muon stations we have used the same naming conventions described in the TP:

BI,BM,BO: for the inner (I), middle (M) and outer (O) stations of the barrel (\(\eta\)\(\leq\) 1.05)

TI,TM,TO: for the corresponding chambers in the transition regions (\(1.05\leq\eta\)\(\leq\) 1.4)

EI,EM,EO: for the chambers belonging to the endcap regions (\(1.4\leq\eta\)).

For the complete description of the global MDT system see Refs [1], [2].

The muon system global view is shown in Fig 1. and the transverse view of the precision chambers layout used is presented in Fig 2 for the barrel region only.

In Fig. 3 a 3D view of the barrel system as simulated in the program reflecting the geometry described in the database is presented.

## 3 Database Structure

The database used is sufficient to reconstruct the basic shape of each type of chamber and its location in the detector coordinate system.

Two different types of chambers are described in the database: intermediate/endcap chambers (11 lines of data), barrel chambers (8 lines of data).

For example Fig 4 shows longitudinal and side views of a generic forward chamber with the chamber dimensions as used in the database (Table 1).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Data descriptions & Formats & Comments \\ \hline chamber name & text & \\ position of origin & x,y,z & ( x = 0 in all cases, in mm) \\ azimuth of chamber & \(\phi\) & ( 0, 22.5 or 45 degrees ) \\ repeat count and angle & count,angle & ( 4,90 or 8,45 ) \\ short edge & mm & \\ long edge & mm & \\ width & mm & \\ no. of layers & Nlayer & ( 3 or 4 ) \\ spacer thickness & mm & \\ overlap & mm & \\ multilayer flag & mflag & ( -1, 0 or 1 ) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Intermediate / Endcap Chambers

Figure 5: _Definition of the position as used in the data file_Fig 5 describes the position of a generic forward chamber with respect to the detector coordinate system and Figure 6 shows the definition of a generic chamber azimuth with respect to the detector coordinate system.

The definitions used in the database for the endcap and the barrel chambers are described below in detail.

### Intermediate / Endcap Chambers

The chamber name is made up of its location (TI,TM,TO, EI,EM,EO) and radial location number (1,2,3). It may also have an 'a' or 'b' to indicate whether its large multilayer is closer to or further from the IP.

**Origin of a chamber** is defined as the mid-point of the short edge of the multilayer closest to the IP.

**Origin position** is given for one basic chamber in a given ring of chambers. It is specified as though the chamber was in the sagittal plane, i.e. the x value is always 0. The y value is the radius to the chamber origin from the beam line. The Z-value is the distance along the beam line, always given as positive (everything repeats at the other end of the detector).

**Azimuth of chamber** is the angle by which the basic reference chamber in a given ring is rotated around the beam line away from the sagittal plane.

**Repeat count and angle tell how often to replicate the chamber and the repeat angle around the beam line.

**Short edge** is the length of the shorter side of the long multilayer.

**Long edge** is the length of the longer side of the long multilayer.

**Width** is the width in the radial direction of the chamber

Figure 6: _Definition of chamber azimuth_

**No. of layers** is the number of tube layers in each multilayer ( 3 or 4 ). The tubes are assumed to be 30 mm outer diameter.

**Spacer thickness** is the thickness of the spacer/support structure connecting the 2 multilayers.

**Overlap** is the overlap in the x-direction of the large multilayer over the small multilayer. The short and long edges of the small multilayer are 2*overlap shorter than those of the large multilayer.

**Multilayer flag** specifies whether the larger multilayer is closer to the IP ( mflag =1 ) : the shorter multilayer is closer to the IP ( mflag = -1 ) : both multilayers have the same length ( mflag = 0 ).

All dimensions are for the overall outer envelopes of the chambers. There will be a dead space at the ends of the tube layers made up of the space needed for electronics and gas, the tube endplug and the dead area at the end of each wire. This is probably in the range 130 to 150 mm. Note that this value affects the overlap ( it appears x2 in the overlap ).

An example record for an El chamber is shown in table 2.

### Barrel Chambers

For the barrel chambers the database structure is defined in table 3.

The chamber name is made up of its location ( BI,BM,BO) and axial location number ( 1,2,3...,7 ). The last character indicates whether it is a long (1) or short (s) chamber.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline eila & 0,2090,6798 & 0 & 4,90 & 2684 & 4473 & 2160 & 4 & 250 & 509 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Record for a forward chamber as described in the database

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Data descriptions & Formats & Comments \\ \hline chamber name & text \\ position of origin & x,y,z \\ azimuth of chamber & \(\phi\) & ( 0, 22.5 or 45 degrees ) \\ repeat count and angle & count,angle & (8,45 in all cases) \\ width (in X-direction) & mm & ( this is the tube direction ) \\ length (in Z-direction) & mm & \\ no. of layers & Nlayer & ( 3 or 4 ) \\ spacer thickness & mm & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Barrel Chambers

**Origin of a chamber** is defined as the mid-point of the edge of the multilayer closest to the IP (both radially and axially).

**Origin position** is given for one basic chamber in a given ring of chambers. It is specified as though the chamber was in the sagittal plane, i.e. the x value is always 0. The y value is the radius to the chamber origin from the beam line. the Z-value is the distance along the beam line ( always given as positive - everything repeats at the other end of the detector.

**Azimuth of chamber** is the angle by which the basic reference chamber in a given ring is rotated around the beam line away from the sagittal ring. E.g. the'small' barrel chambers all use a 22.5 degree azimuth.

**Repeat count and angle** tell how often to replicate the chamber and the repeat angle around the beam line.

**Width** is the width in the circumferential direction around the detector, i.e. this is the tube direction.

**Length** is the Z-direction dimension of the chamber.

**No. of layers** is the number of tube layers in each multilayer ( 3 or 4 ). The tubes are assumed to be 30 mm outer diameter.

**Spacer thickness** is the thickness of the spacer/support structure connecting the 2 multilayers.

All dimensions are for the overall outer envelopes of the chambers. There will be a dead space at the ends of the tube layers made up of the space needed for electronics and gas, the tube endplug and the dead area at the end of each wire. This is probably in the range 130 to 150 mm.

An example record for a BI chamber is shown in Table 4. 4 Each chamber is thus just replicated either 8 times at 45 degree intervals or 4 times at 90 degree intervals around the beam line to build one complete ring.

Footnote 4: Database file is available on cadd.cern.ch site in the pub/seattle/database directory. It will have to be extended to include the various notches etc. and this will probably result in some changes to the data structure.

### Special Cases

Some data are available for some important gaps in the barrel coverage caused by the supports for the main detector rails and the rails themselves:

1. The BM(small) chambers do not exist at azimuth locations 12 and 14 (i.e. 22.5 degrees each side of the bottom centre).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline bill & 0,4697,300 & 0 & 8,45 & 2800 & 960 & 4 & 150 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Record for a barrel chamber as described in the database2. The BI(large) chambers have different X-dimensions in the 3 bottom locations:

location 13 ( bottom ) 2400 mm

locations 11,15 ( each side of 13 ) 2000 mm, but note that these are not centered on the 45 degree azimuth. The chamber is cut short by 800 mm at its end which is adjacent to the rails.

Fig. 7 shows the position of the barrel chambers in a transverse view near the rails.

Figure 8: _Special cases (Endcap Region)_

Figure 7: _Special cases (Barrel Region)_

Fig. 8 displays the dimensions of TI chambers in the bottom 3 octants: they are affected by the rails and their supports. The TI1-11 and TI1-13 chambers will also be affected by the profile of the neutron/gamma shield as it has to pass through the TI location during the maintenance moves. The exact shape of these chambers will probably change when the shield design is completed. The current dimensions should give a good idea of the coverage loss.

The EI MDT chambers all interfere with the BT and will need notches in the corners of the large multilayers.

There are similar holes in the EM amd EO layers to accomodate the rails.

## 4 Program structure

The program used to calculate the geometrical acceptances is based on GEANT and its structure. In the simulation only the muon chambers are considered, all other detector parts are excluded. Magnetic field effects are not considered, and physical processes are excluded. Non interacting particles (geantinos) are shot from the geometrical center of the apparatus and hits are recorded in the muon chambers.

All the information from the database has been translated in the Geant geometry description; sensitive and non sensitive volumes are defined if in that space region a chamber or a dead zone is present. In that way all chambers have a four layers structure, overlappings are taken into account, modularity is respected.

Figure 9: _Side view of a set of forward chambers_

Separately we have considered the nonuniformities in the structure due to cracks or notches.

This program operates in two different ways:

1- a batch mode to cope with the needs of high statistics runs to calculate the acceptance.

2- an interactive mode for detailed studies in a 3D view to have a closer look at a specific part of the spectrometer.

Figure 11: _Muon Spectrometer as simulated in GEANT_

Figure 10: _Forward Muon Spectrometer as simulated in GEANT_

The drawings produced from CAD are shown in Figure 9 for a set of forward chambers. Fig. 10 and Fig. 11 show the forward and the complete \(\mu\) spectrometer as simulated in GEANT.

## 5 Results

The results refer to generation runs at high statistics: non interacting particles are produced in the geometrical centre of the apparatus and shot through the muon detector in a region -3 \(\leq\eta\leq\) 3. and 0. \(\leq\phi\leq\) 2 \(\pi\).

In the simulation the points obtained grouping a set of at least 8 hits for each multilayer(I,M,O) are defined as superpoints. In this way requiring a 3 superpoint event means a request of \(\geq\) 8 hits for each set of multilayers. A 2 superpoints event means a request of \(\geq\) 8 hits for a combination of 2 out of 3 multilayers.

The geometrical acceptance has been separately calculated for three different \(\eta\) regions:

1. barrel (0. - 1.05)

2. intermediate (1.05 - 1.4)

3. endcap (1.4 - 1.8)

Figure 12: _Geometrical acceptance for 3/2 superpoints as a function of \(\eta\)_

For the time being no coverage is considered in the very forward region where the presence of CSC chambers is foreseen (these chambers are not currently in the database and hence not simulated).

Fig 12 shows the mean acceptance as a function of \(\eta\) for two different configurations. The lower curve is related to a perfect measurement (three superpoints) and the upper curve is related to the lower limits for a angle - angle measurement (two superpoints).

Table 5 shows the results obtained when the three different \(\eta\) regions are considered for two different event categories (3 and 2 superpoints).

Acceptances in case of looser cuts (only 4 hits per multilayer are required, instead of 8) are indicated in brackets.

### Barrel region

Fig 13 shows the geometrical acceptance averaged in \(\eta\) as a function of \(\phi\) in the barrel region. Losses in the region near the feet, due to the supports and cracks are clearly seen in the figure. The upper curve refers to an angle - angle measurement, the lower one to a perfect measurement.

Figure 13: Geometrical acceptance for 3/2 superpoints as a function of \(\phi\) in the barrel region

Table 6 shows the variation of the geometrical acceptance in the barrel due to the progressive introduction of nonuniformities in the layout:

1:2- \(\eta\) = 0 crack for I,M,O chambers (contributions from small and large chambers are disentangled in the table (points 1:2)). This crack is 48 cm \(\times\) 2 \(\pi\) at BM, BO (large(L) and small (S)) level, 60 cm \(\times\) 2 \(\pi\) at BI level (L,S).

3 - removal of BM in the two bottom sectors

4 - "A" frames: thesesnine frames require the removal of part of BOS chambers in the bottom two octants (rectangular holes 120 \(\times\) 80 cm \({}^{2}\)).

5 - holes in the BMS chambers, due to the toroid ribs ( \(\approx\) 50 \(\times\) 60 cm \({}^{2}\))

6 - large chimney at \(\approx\eta\) = 1 affecting the BOL-6 only (top sector in the large chambers) ( \(\approx\) 170 \(\times\) 170 cm \({}^{2}\)) to allow the crossing of services.

7 - calorimeter support rails.

8 - larger holes near the coil ribs to allow the presence of connectors

9 - four toroid support feet: cuts in BOL 5 and -5; two sectors.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|c|c||c|} \hline  & \(\eta\) ( 0 -.92 ) & \(\geq\) 8 * 3 & \(\geq\) 8 * 2 & \(\geq\) 4 * 3 & \(\geq\) 4 * 2 \\ \hline
0 & No holes & 1. & 1. & 1. & 1. \\
1 & crack at \(\eta\) = 0 (S) &.975 &.988 &.980 &.990 \\
2 & crack at \(\eta\) = 0 (L) &.917 &.962 &.936 &.966 \\
3 & no BMS (2 sectors) &.857 &.959 &.868 &.963 \\
4 & calorimeter support rails BIL &.812 &.959 &.867 &.963 \\

10 & larger BML, bottom sector (60 cm) &.775 &.947 &.804 &.948 \\
11 & \(\eta\) = 0 crack (15 cm ) &.812 &.959 &.844 &.961 \\
12 & alignement holes &.807 &.954 &.839 &.959 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Acceptances for increasing nonuniformities in the barrel region

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline hits * number of multilayers & \(\geq\) 8 * 3 ( \(\geq\) 4 * 3) & \(\geq\) 8 * 2 (\(\geq\) 4 * 2) \\ \hline Acceptance barrel &.807 (.839) &.954 (.979) \\ Acceptance intermediate &.754 (.799) &.949 (1.) \\ Acceptance endcap &.995 (1.) & 1.(1.) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Mean acceptance for different \(\eta\) coverage In the previous table improvements to these acceptance values are also considered:

10 - enlargement of BML chambers in the bottom sector (60 cm in the transverse direction) to better cope with the "A" frames.

11 - reduction of \(\eta=0\) crack to 15 cm in the I,M,O chambers (minimum requirement for the routing of services and cables).

Contributions to the acceptance due to alignement holes are also taken in to account.

Fig. 14 presents the geometrical acceptance in the \(\eta\), \(\phi\) plane for the barrel region. The crack at \(\eta=0\) is on the bottom of this figure and the lack of BMS chambers in the feet sectors is clearly seen.

### Intermediate / Endcap regions

The \(\eta\) region considered goes from \(\eta=\)1.05 and \(\eta=\)1.8. Higher \(\eta\) values are neglected due to the temporary absence of CSC chambers not yet simulated.

The geometrical configuration of the detector in this region, due to the toroid, limits the acceptance to \(\approx.8\) in the intermediate region, while in the endcap this value is always \(\approx\) 1.

Figure 14: Geometrical acceptance for 3 superpoints as a function of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) in the barrel region

Fig. 15 shows the geometrical acceptance for the three superpoint configuration in the region from \(\eta\) 1.05 to 1.8 and from \(\phi\) 0. to 2 \(\pi\).From the figure are clearly seen the struts and the junction between intermediate and endcap region due to the different \(\phi\) segmentation (8 or 16).

Table 7 shows the acceptance mean values obtained for the 3/2 superpoints case considering also some nonuniformities essentially due to:

1 - TI 1 cuts in the two bottom sectors to allow clearance for the rails

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|c|c||c|c|} \hline  & \(\eta\) ( 1.05 - 1.8 ) & \(\geq\) 8 * 3 & \(\geq\) 8 * 2 & \(\geq\) 4 * 3 & \(\geq\) 4 * 2 \\ \hline
0 & No holes &.810 &.988 &.917 & 1. \\
1 & TI 1 cuts (2 bottom sectors) &.798 &.988 &.907 & 1. \\
2 & EO 2 big notches &.798 &.988 &.918 & 1. \\
3 & E notches (all) &.798 &.988 &.918 & 1. \\
4 & alignement holes &.793 &.983 &.913 & 1. \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: Acceptances for increasing nonuniformities in the intermediate / endcap regions

Figure 15: Geometrical acceptance for 3 superpoints as a function of \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) in the intermediate/forward region

2 - notches in the large multilayer of the EI to clear the barrel toroid coils.

3 - notches in EO2 b to clear the detector rails.

Fig 16 shows the behaviour of the geometrical acceptance in the intermediate/endcap region as a function of \(\eta\) for three superpoints requirement. The two different curves show the acceptance when 4 hits or 8 hits per multilayer are required.

All the results reported here are referring to an event generation flat in \(\theta\).

We have also evaluated the acceptance variations generating flat in \(\eta\). The differences for the various contributions are limited in few percents.

## 6 Conclusions

A calculation of the geometrical acceptance of the ATLAS muon system has been performed by using a GEANT based simulation program. The geometrical description has been obtained from the engineering CAD systems via a technical database which provides all geometrical constants needed to describe the chamber layout. Inefficiencies due to cracks, feet and support structures, which cause losses of acceptance, have also been taken into account.

Future Directions

The database was originally developed for use as input to a parametric CAD system. This allowed rapid update to large CAD models of the MDT system in response to layout changes. This continues to be its primary purpose and, as such, it will be continually extended to incorporate both global layout changes and details of the many special chamber shapes, notches etc. needed to accommodate the magnets and their supports and to provide access for service connections. The CSC chambers will be added.

Significant changes can be expected due to the proposed revisions in the magnet design. These will be added to the database once a stable magnet design is achieved.

While the database in its current form is a useful tool, it is not an efficient way to handle the large amounts of geometry data which will be needed to describe the MDT system in fine detail. It is much more desirable to transfer a complete geometric database directly from the CAD program to GEANT. Work is in progress at CERN to use a new CAD file exchange protocol, STEP, to provide such an interface.
