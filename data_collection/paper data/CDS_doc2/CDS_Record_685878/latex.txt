**FEASIBILITY OF Si STRIP DETECTORS WITH CAPACITIVE**

**CHARGE DIVISION AND DECONVOLUTION FRONT-END**

**ELECTRONICS IN THE ATLAS Si TRACKER**

S. Roe and P. Weilhammer

**1. Introduction**

In this note, we address the possibility of using high-resolution Si strip detectors read out with front-end electronics developed by RD20 for the Si tracker planned for the ATLAS experiment. To achieve the optimal position resolution with a given granularity of strips, intermediate (not read-out) strips are implemented to allow the use of charge division in co-ordinate calculation. [All existing large Si vertex detectors (at SLC, SVX at Fermilab and the 4 vertex detectors in the 4 big LEP experiments) use capacitive charge division.] In first approximation, this method gives a spatial resolution only slightly worse than for the case where every strip is read out. This loss in spatial resolution is due to a large extent to loss of charge to the backplane. For completeness, it should be mentioned that for analogue readout of every strip the average resolution (usually quoted as the \(\sigma\) of a Gaussian fit to a residual distribution and corrected for reference track error) is determined by the amount of charge division through diffusion to the 2 strips nearest the particle trajectory and the signal over noise ratio. In the case of, e.g., the L3 vertex detector, the resolution for 50 (150 \(\mu\)m) readout pitch and 25 \(\mu\)m (50 \(\mu\)m) pitch values of \(\sigma\) = 7 \(\mu\)m (15 \(\mu\)m) have been obtained in test beam conditions. Inherent spatial resolutions obtained with detectors employed in the different Si \(\mu\)-vertex detectors running at LEP are summarised in Table 1. It should be noted that the value quoted for the DELPHI detector (\(\sigma\) = 8 \(\mu\)m) includes all alignment errors, indicating that in that case alignment errors contribute overall with less then 5 \(\mu\)m.

**2. Detectors**

It is assumed that detectors with AC-coupled strips and integrated bias resistors will be used. In this note, only single-sided detectors are considered, since this solution is considered to be more robust and easier to implement. This concept however introduces more material and from the physics viewpoint double-sided detectors are preferable. Therefore the double-sided option will be pursued in a parallel effort.

Single-sided detectors considered are of the type developed and tested by the RD20 Collaboration. Some of the most recent results from this work can be found in references [1] and [2]. In summary, it can be said that these detectors are sufficiently rad-hard to survive a 10 year LHC scenario (\(\chi^{2}\) = 10\({}^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)sec\({}^{-2}\)) for radii above 20 cm. However, one should keep in mind that layers around 20 to 30 cm radius may have to be replaced after several years.

Bulk effects caused by radiation are similar to those observed by other groups (SDC, RD2) and surface effects are well understood and only very slightly influence important parameters, such as bias resistance and interstrip capacitance. Interstrip capacitance increases by 15-20% and polysilicon bias resistors change by less then 10%. For the punch-through biasing method, the observed dynamic bias resistance decreases from hundreds of Megohms initially to a few MQ at the highest doses. The tolerable lower limit for operation at LHC is around 0.5 M\(\Omega\) to limit contributions from the bias resistor to the parallel noise.

The detector layout and some detector parameters considered for this study are summarized in Table 2. Interstrip and backplane capacitances are taken from measurements (Fig. 1). C\({}_{\rm is}\) values in particular are chosen such that a sufficiently large amount of charge is coupled from the intermediate strip to the readout strips. The exact optimum for best signal over noise (still to be determined) might result in slightly different values but will have no influence on the conclusions. Capacitive charge loss is calculated for the worst case, where all charge is deposited on the intermediate strip. The insulator is assumed to be 200 nm SiO\({}_{2}\). Technology developments leading to thinner insulators could improve charge sharing efficiencies by a few percent. Biasing could be done either with polysilicon resistors or punch-through/FOXFET principle. Though punch-through biasing is attractive since it represents probably the lowest cost solution, biasing with polysilicon resistors is the safest choice. The definition of capacitances is given in Fig. 2.

## 3 Front-End Electronics

In this study, the RD20 deconvolution readout architecture [3,4,5] is taken to evaluate noise figures. The front-end consists of a low noise charge-sensitive amplifier and CR-RC shaper with a peaking time of 75 nsec. A particular feature of this design is a novel configuration which allows rails of -2 V to +2 V. This has been implemented in order to optimise the trade-off between noise and power.

The RD20 front-end uses relatively slow shaping for good noise performance at low power consumption and a 3-weight deconvolution processor to provide good time stamping. Each component of the circuit chain - the pre-amplifier/shaper, the analogue pipeline (ADB) and the deconvolution unit (APSP) - has been implemented on a separate chip and successfully tested in a beam in 1992 and 1993 [6,7]. A 32-channel version of the full architecture - preamp/shaper, ADB and APSP - has been implemented in a single chip and is at present under test. In 1994, it is foreseen to further develop this chip into two versions of a 128-channel, one with an integrated multiplexer on the output, the other with parallel outputs to be bonded to a sparsification chip. The full chip will be available by the end of 1994. Several circuits needed for sparsification - a fast discriminator, an ADC, a derandomizing buffer chip with multiplexing facility, etc. - exist already and are being tested.

## 4 The Available Signal Charge

In the readout scheme foreseen at present, some sparsification will be implemented upon a level one trigger. Sparsified readout means in this context that strips with a pulseheight above a preset level are detected and these strips and their respective left and right neighbours are read out. Assuming this sparsification to be achieved by means of a discriminator selecting signals at the output of the APSP exceeding a predetermined threshold, one has to define the minimum signal to be detected above noise in order to have an overall efficient system. For the case of tracks below an angle of impact of about 35\({}^{\circ}\), the conditions as depicted in Fig. 3 are considered.

For tracks inclined more than 35\({}^{\circ}\) w.r.t. the strips, a special study is needed and a specially adapted scheme for the pitch and the readout pitch may be required. The signal from a minimum ionising particle in 300 \(\mu\)m (250 \(\mu\)m) thick Si sensors is 22,000 (18,300) eh-pairs. General signal reductions for all events occur through

* "_Ballistic_" deficit : 0.9
* Trapping after irradiation : 0.8
* Capacitive backplane loss : 0.8 to 0.95.

Event to event Landau fluctuations can result in a maximum reduction by a factor \({}^{2}/_{3}\) w.r.t. the most probable value. Charge sharing by diffusion between two adjacent strips and capacitive charge coupling from intermediate strips to readout strips will result in the worst case to find just \({}^{1}/_{2}\) of the deposited charge on one strip. It should be remarked that in this case one of the neighbouring strip will show the same amount of charge. This fact obviously results in an increase of probability to find a cluster seed.

This gives a worst case minimum charge of \(Q_{min}=0.9\times 0.8\times{}^{2}/_{3}\times{}^{1}/_{2}\times{}Q=5280\) (4400) eh pairs. The charge loss from capacitive coupling is taken into account in each case separately, since this depends on the geometry (see, e.g., Table 2). In the following, it is assumed that a readout system should be able to detect charge greater than values calculated in this way. In the case of the above-mentioned sparsification scheme, it is assumed that one can set the threshold of the discriminator corresponding to this value. This implies that the efficiency of detecting a deposited charge is small at the lowest end of the Landau distribution but will increase very rapidly. Simulations to give efficiency numbers are under way.

## 5 Acceptable Noise Level

The number of acceptable noise hits being accepted by the sparsification has to be studied in much more detail, taking into account bandwidth limitations of the data transmission architecture. The upper limit is full data transmission without on-chip sparsification as considered by CMS.

If a system of roughly 4\(\,\bullet\,\)10\({}^{6}\) channels is taken and the noise distribution is assumed to be Gaussian, one gets for different cuts :\(3\sigma\) : 5600 hits 0.14%

\(4\sigma\) : 130 hits 0.003%

corresponding to 5600 resp. 130 "_noisy_" strips read out in addition to the data.

Considering non-gaussian effects, noisy channels, etc., one can conjecture that a discrimination threshold of \(\sim 3.5\sigma\) to \(4\sigma\) noise is adequate. To allow some margin, in the following we assume that a \(4\sigma\) threshold is necessary. This gives a noise "_roof_" of about 1200 e- (1000 e-) ENC for 300 \(\mu\)m (250 \(\mu\)m) Si. If this goal cannot be reached, thresholds have to be set higher at the cost of efficiency. The loss of efficiency in a layer can clearly be compensated for by adding further layers.

## 6 Amplifier Noise

Serial NoiseFor a CR-RC shaped pulse, the dominant serial noise is

\[\mathrm{ENC}\left(T_{P}\right)=\frac{e\,\bullet\,C_{in}}{q}\sqrt{\frac{\Gamma \,kT\,\left(\eta+1\right)}{3\,T_{P}\,g_{m}}}\left[e^{-}\right]\]

\(e\) = 2.71

\(q\) = electron charge

\(C_{in}\) = total capacitance at input

\(T_{P}\) = shaper peaking time

\(g_{m}\) = transconductance of input FET

\(\Gamma\) = quality factor of process

\(\Gamma\) = 1 is the theoretically optimal value

\(\eta\) = ratio of bulk to channel and gate to channel transconductances;

is found to be very small in the AMS process.

Serial noise after deconvolution, \(\sigma_{dec}\), for a deconvolution ratio \(x=\frac{\Delta t}{T_{P}}\) becomes

\(\sigma_{dec}^{\ 2}=\frac{e^{-2}}{x^{2}}\left[e^{2x}+4x\,\text{-}\,e^{-2x}\right] \,\bullet\,\mathrm{ENC}\left(T_{P}\right)\)

For \(x=1/3\), this gives

\(\sigma_{dec}=1.84\times\mathrm{ENC}\left(T_{P}\right)\)

This relationship has been experimentally verified in RD20.

In the RD20 electronics development, two 32-channel chips containing the full architecture but still without sparsification have been designed and are under test or in production. The "_FELIX_" chip, made in a non rad-hard process (AMS 1.2 \(\mu\)m) has \(T_{P}\) = 75 nsec and the APV5 chip in a rad-hard process (Harris ALSVSIRA 1.2 \(\mu\)m) has \(T_{P}\) = 50 nsec.

For a given \(T_{p}\) and \(\Gamma\) factor, the noise slope is limited by the \(g_{m}\) one can reach. The \(g_{m}\) versus drain current \(I_{d}\) of the input FET is shown in Fig. 4 for a 2 mm wide transistor in the AMS process, which is used in the FELIX chip.

In the following, the AMS FELIX chip is assumed for readout. \(g_{m}\) = 4.5 mA/V and \(T_{p}\) = 75 nsec are taken, which requires \(I_{d}\) = 400 \(\mu A\). It has been shown that the FELIX chip will develop \(P\) = 1.9 mW with this drain current [9].

The noise slope with these parameters and assuming \(\Gamma\) = 1, which is very nearly fulfilled in the AMS process, is

\[\text{ENC (75 nsec) / C}_{in}=35\text{ e}^{-}/\text{ pF}\]

The total load capacitance \(C_{\text{load}}\), including all contributions from a detector, is

\[C_{\text{load}}=C_{\text{is}}^{\text{tot}}+C_{\text{BP}}^{\text{tot}}+C_{ \text{INPFET}}+C_{\text{Stray}}\]

The total interstrip capacitance \(C_{\text{is}}^{\text{tot}}\) of one strip is its capacitance to the virtual ground of all neighbouring strips. \(C_{\text{BP}}^{\text{tot}}\) is the total backplane capacitance seen by one amplifier. The values in Table 2, which are used in the following, are taken from recent RD20 measurements with detectors with 50 \(\mu\)m pitch and 100 \(\mu\)m pitch [1].

These values give for 6 cm strip length (12 cm strip length)

\(C_{\text{load}}\) = 14 pF (22 pF) for 200 \(\mu\)m readout pitch

\(C_{\text{load}}\) = 15 pF (22 pF) for 100 \(\mu\)m readout pitch

\(C_{\text{load}}\) = 16 pF for 50 \(\mu\)m readout pitch

In each case, one intermediate strip is taken.

This gives for 6 cm strip length (12 cm strip length)

\(\text{ENC}_{6\text{ cm}}^{\text{tot}}\) = 490 e\({}^{-}\)(770 e\({}^{-}\)) \(T_{p}\) = 75 nsec

\(\text{ENC}_{6\text{ cm}}^{\text{tot}}\) = 525 e\({}^{-}\)(770 e\({}^{-}\)) \(T_{p}\) = 75 nsec

\(\text{ENC}_{6\text{ cm}}^{\text{tot}}\) = 970 e\({}^{-}\)(1420 e\({}^{-}\)) after deconvolution for 100 \(\mu\)m r.o.p.

\(\text{ENC}_{6\text{ cm}}^{\text{tot}}\) = 570 e\({}^{-}\) \(T_{p}\) = 75 nsec

\(\text{ENC}_{6\text{ cm}}^{\text{tot}}\) = 1060 e\({}^{-}\) after deconvolution for 50 \(\mu\)m r.o.p.

_b)_ _Shot Noise from Leakage Current_

The noise contribution from leakage current I\({}_{\text{I}}\) for CR-RC filtering is

\[\text{ENC (I${}_{\text{L}}$T${}_{\text{P}}$)}=\frac{\text{e}}{\text{q}}\sqrt{ \frac{\text{q}^{*}\text{I}_{\text{I}}^{*}\text{T}_{\text{P}}}{4}}\]

The parallel noise after deconvolution is

\[\text{ENC${}_{\text{dec}}$}=\left(\frac{\text{e}^{-2}}{\text{x}^{2}}\right) \times\left[\text{e}^{2\text{x}}\cdot\text{4x}\cdot\text{e}^{-2\text{x}}\right] \times\text{ENC (I${}_{\text{I}}$, $T${}_{\text{P}}$)}\]

In this case

\[\text{ENC${}_{\text{dec}}$}=0.35\times\text{ENC (I${}_{\text{I}}$, $T${}_{\text{P}}$)}\]

This relationship has been experimentally verified in RD20.

Leakage currents and the resulting figures for shot noise are given in Table 3 for several radii and 100 \(\upmu\)m and 200 \(\upmu\)m readout pitch. The calculation of leakage currents used the latest compilation of expected fluences by S. Roe and a damage constant of 3*10-17 A/cm for the non-annealing component (Table 4 and Fig. 5). For 50 \(\upmu\)m, 100 \(\upmu\)m and 200 \(\upmu\)m pitch, the leakage current is 2.7*10-20 \(\times\) F, 5.4*10-20 \(\times\) F and 10.8*10-20 \(\times\) F [amps]. F is fluence in neutron equivalent flux.

_c)_ _Total Noise_

In the best circumstances, the total noise will be the _"square"_ sum of the serial noise of the input FET and parallel noise from leakage current, assuming negligible contributions from 1/f noise, bulk resistance or bias resistor. In Table 5a and 5b, the noise figures and minimum and average signal over noise ratios at the start-up time (neglecting leakage current contributions) are listed for different options of readout. Also shown are signal over noise ratios for the peak sample (75 nsec shaping time), which can in principle be used for co-ordinate calculation until the leakage current becomes dominant. In this case, it is assumed that the time stamping is done with the deconvoluted amplitude.

In Table 6a, the total calculated noise at the end of 10 years running for an average position of tracks along the barrel and tracks which go through the end of the barrel, are shown both for 100 \(\upmu\)m and 200 \(\upmu\)m readout pitch. In Table 6b, the corresponding numbers for minimal signal over noise ratios are given. Tables 7a and 7b give the same information for the case of 12 cm long strips.

Detectors with 50 \(\upmu\)m readout pitch with one intermediate strip and 6 cm strip length, which might be of interest for a precision layer at r = 20 cm, will have an average noise of 1100 e- and a minimal S/N ratio of 4.4 at the end of 10 years.

## 7 Comparison With Readout Of Every Strip

The case of capacitively-coupled detectors with 100 \(\upmu\)m readout pitch, readout at every strip, is treated, assuming again the RD20 front-end electronics for readout. A 12 \(\upmu\)m p\({}^{+}\)-implant width is assumed. The model is shown in Fig. 6.

The values for such a configuration as measured with RD20 prototypes are C\({}_{\text{is}}\) = 0.30 pF/cm (to one side), C\({}_{\text{is}}\) (other strips ) = 0.15 pF/cm (to one side), the backplane capacitance C\({}_{\text{BP}}\) = 0.34 pF/cm and C\({}_{\text{C}}\) = 20 pF/cm. In this case, the fraction of the total charge arriving at the p\({}^{+}\) strip, which is coupled into the amplifier, is Q\({}_{\text{C}}\) = QTOT \(\frac{\text{C}_{\text{C}}}{\text{C}+\text{C}_{\text{is}}^{\text{tot}}+\text{C} _{\text{BP}}}\) = 0.95 QTOT. For a strip length of 6 cm, C\({}_{\text{load}}\) = 15.4 pF. This gives ENC = 540 e which results in 990 electrons after deconvolution.

For a 12 cm strip length, one gets C\({}_{\text{load}}\) = 23 pF and ENC = 800 e equivalent to 1480 electrons after deconvolution. Tables 8a and 8b summarise the total noise and signal over noise ratios, including shot noise, for the case of 12 cm strip length.

## 8 Expected Spatial Resolution

First measurements in a test beam during 1993 using the RD20 T\({}_{\text{p}}\) = 45 nsec prototype CR-RC amplifier-shaper (run with gm \(\leq\) 3 mA/V) and 4 cm long strip detector test devices (irradiated and non-irradiated) are shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. The deconvoluted results were obtained by sampling the shaped output pulse at 67 MHz and performing a deconvolution, using the measured samples [8]. The results indicate that with appropriate improvements in the order of 30% the required noise performance can be reached.

The noise levels required for sufficient noise hit rejection will guarantee that the spatial resolution is good enough for momentum measurement in ATLAS. With 100 \(\upmu\)m and 200 \(\upmu\)m readout pitch and 50 \(\upmu\)m pitch, the ALEPH vertex detector achieves \(\sigma\) = 12 \(\upmu\)m and \(\sigma\) = 18 \(\upmu\)m resp. with S/N ratios in the order of 15 (\(\sim\) 1500 e\({}^{-}\) ENC). For high accuracy vertexing, the necessary precision in r\(\phi\) of around \(\sigma\) = 10 \(\upmu\)m can be obtained with 50 \(\upmu\)m readout pitch in the layer at r = 20 cm (for B-physics also in the r = 6 cm layer), assuming that an alignment precision of better than 6 to 7 \(\upmu\)m can be achieved.

## 9 A Provisional Channel Count and Cost

A typical barrel layout of the type discussed in the Steering Group and the ID Review Panel is considered in INDET-No 035 from 26/11/93 (Table 9). A layout of this kind would fulfil the requirements on resolution, background rejection and efficiency expected from the ATLAS high precision Si tracker for the whole lifetime of the experiment. Important questions such as r\(\phi\), z (short z) versus small angle stereo have to be answered by detailed simulations. It hasalso to be emphasised that an eventual r = 6 cm layer has to be built such that it can easily be removed when it is no longer useful.

The estimated cost of such a detector compared to the estimated cost of the "_Coseners House_" design is given in Table 10.

**10. Summary**

The performance of Si strip detector modules with analogue readout for the ATLAS Inner Tracker is evaluated, assuming that the front-end architecture developed in RD20 is used. In order to achieve the required noise slope of 35 e\({}^{-}\)/pF at T\({}_{\rm p}\)= 75 nsec, the input FET will have to be run with a drain current of I\({}_{\rm d}\) = 400 \(\mu\)A. This will result in a power consumption of 1.9 mW per channel for the full front-end chip, including the ADB (pipeline) and the APSP. The preamplifier alone contributes 0.8 mW.

The calculated noise and signal over noise figures show that for the worst case scenario (minimal signals shared equally between 2 strips, end of 10 years high luminosity running), a 4\(\sigma\) threshold cut in a sparsification scheme will introduce some inefficiencies for the low portion of the Landau distribution. Such inefficiencies will be lowered by the fact that in this case two neighbouring strips will have the same signal and be able to independently trigger the discriminator. It is therefore important to consider at least one additional layer on top of what is minimally needed for good pattern recognition. The inefficiencies will be determined quantitatively through simulation.

A comparison between readout of every strip and capacitive charge division readout with one intermediate strip shows that with equal numbers of electronic channels (12 cm strip length versus 6 cm strip length) capacitive charge division has better performance, both at start-up and after 10 years of running. Comparing capacitive charge division with direct readout, both at 12 cm strip length, the capacitive charge division option is maximally 15% worse in signal over noise for radii of 30 cm and above. Since in this case one has only 50% of electronic channels, one might consider increasing the transconductance to improve the noise performance at the cost of increased power in the pre-amplifier stage (additional 200 to 300 \(\mu\)W per channel). Both methods will suffer from inefficiencies when the noise contributions from leakage currents become important. This may be a good reason for trying to run at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C.

It should be emphasised that with average signal to noise ratios of around 20:1 at the beginning of the experiment, which will deteriorate to around 13:1 at the end of 10 years running, one expects to obtain the required spatial resolution and pattern recognition capability. One of the most critical parameters in the design of a Si tracker appears to be the noise of the front-end amplifier. All efforts will be made to improve the noise performance of the front-end chip. It may be necessary to increase the presently foreseen power consumption slightly in order to decrease the noise slope further.
