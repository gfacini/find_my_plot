**Abstract**

The production of excited quarks at CERN LHC through the quark gluon fusion mechanism and their subsequent decays to ordinary quarks and gluons are investigated.

Introduction

There is a great deal of theoretical activity focused on new physics that would solve the problems of the Standard Model (SM) and which would also be detectable at the energy scale accessible to ATLAS at LHC. Predictions for compositeness have been made from models [1] invoking new phenomena at a scale where we can search for substructure of quarks. The most convincing evidence for a substructure of quarks would be the discovery of excited quarks \(q^{\star}\). Assuming the mass of excited quarks is at least of the order of the compositeness scale \(\Lambda\), the effective Lagrangian for transitions between excited quarks \(q^{\star}\) of mass \(m^{\star}\) and common quarks \(q\) is constrained by gauge invariance to be [2, 3]

\[L=\frac{1}{2\Lambda}\overline{q}_{R}^{\star}\sigma^{\mu\nu}\left(g_{s}f_{s} \frac{\lambda_{a}}{2}G_{\mu\nu}^{a}+gf\frac{\tau}{2}W_{\mu\nu}+g^{\prime}f^{ \prime}\frac{Y}{2}B_{\mu\nu}\right)q_{L}+h.c. \tag{1}\]

where \(G^{a}\), \(W\), and \(B\) are the field-strength tensors for the \(SU(3)\), \(SU(2)\), and \(U(1)\) gauge fields, respectively; \(\lambda_{a}\), \(\tau\), and \(Y\) are the corresponding gauge structure constants; and \(g_{s}\), \(g\), and \(g^{\prime}\) are the corresponding gauge coupling constants. Finally, \(f_{s}\), \(f\), and \(f^{\prime}\) are couplings determined by the compositeness dynamics.

Excited quarks can be produced dominantly via quark gluon fusion, and then decay into a quark and any gauge boson (\(g\), \(W\), \(Z\), \(\gamma\)). We assume that the gauge interactions are dominating. The signals for excited quarks are resonances in channels of large transverse momentum \(jj\), \(j\gamma\), \(jW\) or \(jZ\) pairs with an invariant mass peaking at \(m^{\star}\).

The two-jet invariant mass spectrum as measured by the UA2 experiment [4] was used to search for excited quarks. The limits obtained fir the masses of degenerate \(u^{\star}\) and \(d^{\star}\) excited quarks were found to be greater than 288 GeV. The CDF Collaboration searched for resonances in jet\(+\)photon and jet\(+\)W invariant mass in \(p\bar{p}\) collisions at the center of mass energy \(\sqrt{s}=1.8\) TeV and has excluded the mass range \(80<m^{\star}<540\) GeV [5]. Furthermore, the CDF has excluded the ranges for the excited quark masses \(200<m^{\star}<520\) GeV and \(580<m^{\star}<760\) GeV in the 2-jets channel [7]. The D0 Collaboration has also excluded the mass region \(200<m^{\star}<720\) GeV for all channels [8]. These exclusions are for the couplings \(f=f^{\prime}=f_{s}=1\) and the compositeness scale was set equal to the mass of the excited quark ( \(\Lambda=m^{\star}\) ). Since the mass limit is sensitive to the choice of couplings, the excluded mass regions decrease slightly for smaller couplings.

This work is a continuation of our previous work [9] devoted to the study of excited quark production with its decay to a quark and \(\gamma\). In the present paper, we investigate the quark + gluon decay mode of excited quarks at the CERN LHC.

## 2 Decay Widths

Excited quarks will decay into quarks and gauge bosons. The decay widths can be derived from the effective Lagrangian (1). We assume \(m^{\star}>m_{W,Z}\) and neglect common quark masses to obtain the decay widths [3]

\[\Gamma(q^{\star}\to qg) = \frac{1}{3}\alpha_{s}f_{s}^{\ 2}\frac{m^{\star 3}}{\Lambda^{2}} \tag{2}\] \[\Gamma(q^{\star}\to q\gamma) = \frac{1}{4}\alpha f_{\gamma}^{2}\frac{m^{\star 3}}{\Lambda^{2}}\] (3) \[\Gamma(q^{\star}\to qV) = \frac{1}{8}\frac{g_{V}^{2}}{4\pi}f_{V}^{2}\frac{m^{\star 3}}{ \Lambda^{2}}\left(1-\frac{m_{V}^{2}}{m^{\star 2}}\right)^{2}\left(2+\frac{m_{V}^{2}}{m^{ \star 2}}\right) \tag{4}\]where \(f_{\gamma}=fT_{3}+f^{\prime}\frac{Y}{2}\), \(f_{Z}=fT_{3}cos^{2}\theta_{W}-f^{\prime}\frac{Y}{2}sin^{2}\theta_{W}\) and \(f_{W}=\frac{f}{\sqrt{2}}\) with \(T_{3}\) and \(Y\) being the third component of the weak isospin and the hypercharge of excited quark \(q^{\star}\), respectively. The decay widths \(\Gamma\) of excited quarks into ordinary quarks and gauge bosons \(g,W,Z,\gamma\) and the relative branching ratios BR, obtained from PYTHIA [10], are given in the Table 1 for excited quark masses \(m^{\star}=1-5\) TeV and \(f=f_{s}=f^{\prime}=1\). As can be seen from Table 1, decay of the excited quarks to common quarks via the emission of a gluon represents about \(83\%\) of all its decays and the sum of the partial decay widths into the gluon, W, Z and photon channels, gives the half width \(\Gamma/2\sim 0.03m^{\star}\) when the mass \(m^{\star}=1\) TeV, the couplings \(f=f^{\prime}=f_{s}=1\) and \(\Lambda=m^{\star}\).

## 3 Physics Simulation

The simulation of excited quark signal (quark and gluon ) and relevant backgrounds was performed with ATLFAST [11] to take into account the experimental conditions prevailing at LHC for the ATLAS detector [12]. The hadronic calorimeters which are crucial for the jets reconstruction of the signal are used to reconstruct the energy in cells of dimensions \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.05\times 0.05\) with the pseudorapidity range \(-2.5<\eta<2.5\) ( barrel region ). The hadronic energy resolution is given by \(0.5/\sqrt{E}\oplus 0.03\) over this \(\eta\) region. Hadronic showers are regarded as jets when they lie within a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.7\) and possess a transverse energy \(E_{T}>15\) GeV.

In this work, only the first generation quarks, \(u^{\star}\) and \(d^{\star}\) are simulated for the excited quark signal. We consider the signal through the processes \(ug{\rightarrow}u^{\star}\)\({\rightarrow}ug\), \(dg{\rightarrow}d^{\star}{\rightarrow}dg\), shown in Figure 1. The signal is considered as a peak in the two jets invariant mass \(m_{jj}\) corresponding to the subprocesses \(qg{\rightarrow}q^{\star}{\rightarrow}qg\). The partonic level information from PYTHIA for the decay products of excited quarks are shown in Figure 2. The solid and the dashed lines represent the contribution from \(u\) quark and \(d\) quark, respectively. The ratio of contributions represents the quark constituency in proton.

The main background for these signal processes comes from lowest order QCD subprocesses which produce a large number of jets originating from \(qq{\rightarrow}qq\), \(q\overline{q}{\rightarrow}gg\), \(qg{\rightarrow}qg\), \(gg{\rightarrow}gg\) and \(gg{\rightarrow}q\overline{q}\). Processes involving the production of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons ( with their subsequent decay into jets ) are also analyzed. However, for the latter type of background the relevant cross-section values are small with respect to the lowest order QCD jets background.

As can be seen from Figure 2, the jets from the signal have sufficieFigure 1: Feynman graph for the excited quark production via the quark gluon fusion and the subsequent decay into quark+gluon.

momenta in the mid-pseudorapidity region. That could help to eliminate corresponding backgrounds. Another feature which could be also useful to separate the signal from the background is a dijet angular distribution. For the QCD background, \(dN/dcos\theta^{*}\sim 1/(1-cos\theta^{*})^{2}\), where \(\theta^{*}\) is the scattering angle in the subprocess centre of mass, whereas for the signal process an isotropic dijet angular distribution \(dN/dcos\theta^{*}\sim 1\) is characteristic.

The production cross sections as a function of the mass of the excited quarks are given in Table 2. The CTEQ[13] parton distribution function has been used for the signal and background calculations. It was verified that the use of other PDF like CTEQ4L[14] or MRS[15] would change the presented values by the order of \(\pm(5-10)\%\).

The two jets effective mass distributions, \(m_{jj}\) as obtained from ATLFAST for different \(m^{\star}\) are shown in Figure 3. One can see that the widths of the mass distributions presented are rather small even for high values of \(m_{jj}\). We can see from Figure 3 that the dijet mass resolution is roughly a Gaussian with a RMS deviation of \(\sigma\sim\) of 3-4% depending on the mass value. Jets from a high mass resonance are essentially emitted back-to-back, that provides a good opportunity to separate them.

The relevant background cross sections are presented in Table 3. In order to enrich the event statistics in the region of high invariant masses of the jet+jet system, the background simulation was done separately for events in different regions of the reaction transverse momentum, \(\hat{p}_{T}\). Here the contributions from lowest order QCD background and the background subprocesses with Z and W production are summed up, the contributions from the latter background varies for different \(\hat{p}_{T}\) regions but does not exceed \(0.6\%\) of the total cross-section.

The following cuts were used to separate the signal from the backgrounds:

* The transverse momentum of two jets with highest \(p_{T}\) in event to be at least \(p_{T}>\) 400 GeV ( for \(m^{\star}\)=1000 GeV ) and increased for higher \(m^{\star}\). Minimum transverse momentum cuts are chosen to be \(m^{\star}/2-\Delta p_{T}\), where \(\Delta p_{T}\) is optimized for each \(m^{\star}\).
* The rapidity interval \(|\eta|<\) 2.0 ( \(|\eta|<\) 1.0 for \(m^{\star}>\) 5000 GeV and beyond)
* The angular cut \(cos\theta^{*}<\) 2/3 to reduce the contribution from QCD background jets. The efficiencies of the above cuts on the signal and background separation are presented in Table 4 for \(m^{\star}=\) 1000 GeV and \(m^{\star}=\) 3000 GeV cases.

The results for different \(m^{\star}\) are presented in Figures 4 - 5. The distributions were normalized for an integrated luminosity of \(3\times 10^{4}\)pb\({}^{-1}\). In Figure 4, are shown \(d\sigma/dm_{jj}\) distributions for the excited quark mass \(m^{\star}=\) 1000 GeV and 2000 GeV with the corresponding backgrounds. Invariant mass distributions of the two-jet system for the excited quark signal with the coupling \(f=f^{\prime}=f_{s}=1\) and \(0.5\) and the corresponding backgrounds are also given in Figure 5 for the mass \(m^{\star}=3\) and \(5\) TeV.
