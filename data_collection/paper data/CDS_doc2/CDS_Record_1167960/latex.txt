# Search for highly-excited string states with ATLAS

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Using fully simulated data samples, we have set limits on the cross section versus lower-mass threshold for string ball production. Assuming a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) at a proton-proton centre of mass energy of 10 TeV, cross section values greater than 185 fb over the threshold mass range of 3.0 to 5.4 TeV have been excluded at the 95% confidence level. Based on a simple model for string ball production, values of the string scale of less than 1.6 TeV and the Planck scale of less than 2.4 TeV could be excluded.

Introduction

The possibility of black hole production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has been well studied for the case in which the black hole can be treated semiclassically, and is produced and decays according to the concepts of general relativity (GR). The conditions required on the mass of gravitational objects for them to be considered GR black holes is given by \(M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 5M_{D}\), where \(M_{D}\) is the fundamental Planck scale in higher dimensions. If \(M_{D}\) is about 1 TeV, imposing the GR condition on black holes leads to a requirement on the black hole mass of \(M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim 5\) TeV. Thus high mass GR black holes may not be accessible to the LHC.

Below this GR threshold we enter the regime of quantum gravity. An exciting possibility for this regime is to treat it in the context of weakly-coupled string theory. It has been shown that highly-excited string states - string balls - produced below the GR threshold could have a cross section comparable to that of the black hole [1, 2, 3]. Hence, these states will be even more accessible than black holes at the LHC. Moreover, even if black holes are produced at the LHC, they will evolve into these string states. In themselves, string balls are interesting because they are a new form of matter involving gravity and string theory.

The production of string states and black holes depends on four free parameters: the string scale \(M_{\rm s}\), the string coupling \(g_{\rm s}\), the number of extra dimensions \(n\), and the fundamental Planck scale \(M_{D}\). Typically

\[M_{\rm s}<M_{D}<\frac{M_{\rm s}}{g_{\rm s}^{2}}\,. \tag{1}\]

\(M_{\rm s}/g_{\rm s}^{2}\) is the minimum mass above which a black hole can be treated according to general relativity and thus \(M_{\rm s}/g_{\rm s}^{2}\approx 5M_{D}\). To be in the highly-excited stringy regime, we require the string ball mass to be greater than \(3M_{\rm s}\).

The parton-parton cross section is given by [4]

\[\hat{\sigma}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}\frac{g_{\rm s}^{2}M^{2}}{M^{4}}&M_{ \rm s}\ll M\leq\frac{M_{\rm s}}{g_{\rm s}}\,,\\ \frac{1}{M_{\rm s}^{2}}&\frac{M_{\rm s}}{g_{\rm s}}\leq M\leq\frac{M_{\rm s}}{ g_{\rm s}^{2}}\,,\\ \pi\frac{f^{2}(n)}{M_{D}^{2}}\left(\frac{M}{M_{D}}\right)^{\frac{2}{n+1}}& \frac{M_{\rm s}}{g_{\rm s}^{2}}<M\,,\end{array}\right. \tag{2}\]

where

\[f(n)\equiv\left[\frac{2^{n}\pi^{\frac{n-3}{2}}\Gamma\left(\frac{n+3}{2}\right) }{n+2}\right]^{\frac{1}{n+1}}\,. \tag{3}\]

The lower two energy ranges lead to string ball production and the higher range leads to black hole production.

Highly-excited long strings emit particles with a thermal spectrum at the Hagedorn temperature [5]. Hence, the conventional description of black hole evaporation in terms of blackbody emission can be applied to highly excited string states. Assuming a type-I string theory, the emissions can take place either in the bulk (into closed strings) or on the brane (into open strings). The string ball decays mainly on the brane [1].

Monte Carlo Simulation

String ball production and decay were simulated using the Monte Carlo event generator described in Ref. [4]. The string ball generator was built on a modified version [6] of the black hole generator CHARYBDIS [7]. The beam energy was set to 5 TeV. Five string ball samples were studied. The parameters defining the different samples are shown in Table 1. For each sample, 2,000 events were generated.

Top-quark and QCD dijet events were considered for backgrounds. Events involving \(W\to\ell\nu_{\ell}+\mathrm{jets}\), \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}+\mathrm{jets}\), \(\gamma+\mathrm{jets}\), and \(\gamma\gamma+\mathrm{jets}\), where \(\ell=e\) or \(\mu\), were shown to have negligible contributions to high-mass final states [9]. The top-quark samples were generated using MC@NLO [10] and the dijet samples were generated using PYTHIA [11]. Both hadronic and leptonic decays of the \(W\) bosons from the top-quark decays were allowed. By using PYTHIA dijets, complete QCD inclusive jet production is not fully modelled due to the lack of higher-order QCD contributions. This is a known deficiency of the study presented here. When real data becomes available, QCD Monte Carlo predictions would have to be normalized to the real QCD events in a side band just below the signal region.

A full detector and trigger simulation was used to produce all the event samples. Each string ball produces multiple visible decay products, including hadronic jets, leptons, and photons. The presence of multiple high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets per event, each of which is likely to pass the trigger, results in very high total efficiencies (greater than 99%).

## 3 Particle Identification and Event Selection

We identified muons, electrons, photons, and jets. Collectively we call them objects in this note. Using standard ATLAS identification algorithms [9], we selected muons, photons and electrons in the kinematic range \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>15\) GeV. Jets were selected in the kinematic range \(|\eta|<5\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV.

The identification of objects was sometimes ambiguous, e.g., an electron could be simultaneously reconstructed as a jet. Once an object passed the particle identification criteria, we resolved the ambiguity between objects with \(\Delta R<0.1\) by selecting muons, electrons, photons, and jets in that order of priority. Any remaining ambiguous assignments were removed.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(M_{\mathrm{s}}\) & \(M_{D}\) & \(M_{\mathrm{thresh}}\) & \(\sigma\) \\ (TeV) & (TeV) & (TeV) & (pb) \\ \hline
1.0 & 1.5 & 3.0 & \(2.3\times 10^{+1}\) \\
1.2 & 1.8 & 3.6 & \(4.7\times 10^{+0}\) \\
1.4 & 2.1 & 4.2 & \(9.6\times 10^{-1}\) \\
1.6 & 2.4 & 4.8 & \(1.9\times 10^{-1}\) \\
1.8 & 2.7 & 5.4 & \(3.3\times 10^{-2}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: String ball generator parameters for the different signal samples. \(M_{\mathrm{s}}\) is the string scale, \(M_{D}\) is the Planck scale (PDG convention [8]), \(M_{\mathrm{thresh}}\) is the lower mass threshold for string ball production, and \(\sigma\) is the proton-proton cross section for string ball production.

To reconstruct string balls, we used all the selected objects to form the invariant mass of the event, the scalar sum of \(p_{\rm T}\) of all the objects, etc.. The invariant mass of the event was calculated from the four-momenta \(p_{i}\) of all the reconstructed final state objects and missing transverse energy \(\not{E}_{\rm T}\) using

\[M=\sqrt{p^{\,2}}\,,\quad\mbox{where}\quad p=\sum_{i}p_{i}+(\not{E}_{\rm T}, \not{E}_{\rm Tx},\not{E}_{\rm Ty},0)\,. \tag{4}\]

\(\not{E}_{\rm T}\) was included in the calculation to improve the reconstructed mass resolution.

Fig. 1 shows the reconstructed invariant mass distribution for the string ball events and background events with only particle identification cuts applied. In addition, for the QCD dijet sample, the parton transverse momentum defined in the rest frame of the parton-parton scattering was required to be greater than 70 GeV. Due to finite resolution effects, the reconstructed mass distributions are no longer exponential distributions. There is considerable migration of mass values, including values below the generated mass thresholds. Rather than use an unfolding procedure at this time, we simply require the reconstructed invariant mass to be above the mass threshold. This results in some loss in signal efficiency. Table 2 shows the signal efficiencies after imposing reconstructed invariant mass requirements that are equal to the mass threshold values. Also shown in Table 2 are the remaining number of background events for a luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\).

Background Rejection

Fig. 2 shows the scalar summation of the \(p_{\rm T}\) of all the objects plus missing transverse energy, \(\sum|\vec{p}_{\rm T}|+\not{E}_{\rm T}\), which demonstrates good background discrimination at high values. We require \(\sum|\vec{p}_{\rm T}|+\not{E}_{\rm T}\) to be larger than a cut value to reject backgrounds. Fig. 3 shows the invariant mass distributions after this requirement for \(M_{\rm s}=1\) TeV string balls and backgrounds. The top-quark background is reduced to a negligible level (less than \(10^{-2}\) events per 200 GeV per pb\({}^{-1}\)).

The QCD dijet background is already well suppressed, but we also investigate the effect of a further cut, requiring a lepton (electron or muon) with \(p_{\rm T}>100\) GeV (Fig. 4). This results in the QCD dijet background being rejected (less than \(3\times 10^{-2}\) events per 200 GeV per pb\({}^{-1}\)).

## 5 Exclusion Limits

The five signal data sets shown in the Table 1 were used to calculate the efficiency as a function of the cuts. The cuts on \(\sum|\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}}|+\not{E}_{\mathrm{T}}\) and lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) were chosen to optimise the statistical significance. The cut statistics are shown in Table 3. The reconstructed mass was always required to be above the threshold.

The estimated efficiencies and backgrounds are shown in Table 4, for an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\). Within errors (3%), the efficiency is constant. The quoted efficiency and background uncertainties include only Monte Carlo statistics. The dominant systematic uncertainty is an assumed 15% error on the luminosity. To derive the expected limits, the expected number of background events was conservatively rounded up to the next integer number of observed events, and systematic uncertainties included.

The efficiency and estimated background errors are due to the Monte Carlo statistics only. The effect of a 5% uncertainty in the jet energy scale was studied in the context of black holes in Ref. [9]. The effect on the number of signal events was typically below 1%, while the effect on the number of background events was 10% to 30%. The effect of loosening and tightening the lepton identification was studied in the context of black holes in Ref. [9]. The effect on the number of signal events was typically below 1%, while the effect on the number

of background events was 0% to 17%. In both cases, the uncertainty on the systematic errors for the background events was limited by the Monte Carlo statistics, and in most cases is less than the statistical error on the remaining number of background events. The assumed 15% luminosity uncertainty thus dominates the uncertainties that were considered in this study.

Using the results in Table 4, Fig. 5 shows the 95% upper limits on the cross section for each mass threshold. The cross section is always less than 185 fb. Also shown in Fig. 5 is a model prediction [4]. The cross section upper limits are well below the model predictions over a wide range of mass threshold values. Thus 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data would be enough to exclude most models that predict a cross section based on totally inelastic parton-parton scattering. Such models would predict cross section values above our limits out to high mass thresholds and thus could be used to constrain the fundamental Planck scale to higher values than previous collider limits.

The cross section upper limit is below the model predictions out to a mass threshold value of about 4.85 TeV. This mass threshold corresponds to a string scale of about 1.6 TeV and Planck scale of about 2.4 TeV in the model of Ref. [4].

## 6 Summary

One candidate for quantum gravity is weakly-coupled string theory. By embedding string theory in large extra dimensions it is possible to predict the occurrence of highly excited string states above the fundamental string scale. Assuming a data sample with an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) at a proton-proton centre of mass energy of 10 TeV, cross section values greater than 185 fb over the threshold mass range of 3.0 to 5.4 TeV have been excluded at the 95%

confidence level. Values of \(M_{\rm s}\) less than 1.6 TeV and \(M_{D}\) less than 2.4 TeV could be excluded in the model presented in Ref. [4].
