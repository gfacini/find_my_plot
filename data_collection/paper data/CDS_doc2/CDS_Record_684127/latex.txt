Introduction

The Higgs field added to the Standard Model (SM) to render it renormalizable has a very famous hierarchy problem associated with it. The plausible models available today that can explain this hierarchy all imply new exotic physics. Probably the most favored alternative is that the world is supersymmetric (SUSY) at high energies. And since all current low energy observations can be explained without SUSY, there must exist a mechanism that breaks SUSY at lower energy into the Standard Model (SM) if SUSY shall have any room to play in the domain of TeV physics. An interesting model from an experimental point of view is Gauge Mediated SUSY Breaking (GMSB) [1].

Much of the GMSB phenomenology applicable for the ATLAS detector has already been explored in a previous study [2]. However, a very interesting part of the GMSB parameter space was not covered. That is when the \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) slepton is the only next-to-lightest sparticle (NLSP). Depending on the lifetime of the NLSP which is one of the free parameters in GMSB, two distinct cases emerge. Either the \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) decays close to the production vertex with \(\tau\) leptons in the final state which make the experimental situation quite difficult, or the \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) is quasi-stable and decays outside of the detector. In the latter case the experimental signal is very clean due to the NLSPs that appear as spectacular heavy charged particles in the muon system. Actually one of the most important handles on the model as is pointed out in [3] is the NLSP lifetime. However, lifetime measurements require detailed full simulation which is outside the scope of this work. A detailed discussion can be found in [4].

## 2 The model

The effective models of GMSB is a sub class of models within the framework of the Minimal Supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). Due to general arguments e.g. soft SUSY breaking (SSB) the number of parameters in MSSM are more than 120 in addition to the 19 in the SM. Much of the MSSM parameter space is highly unphysical including e.g. rapid proton decay and lepton number violation and hence a so called R parity conservation is added ad hoc. In order to understand the model some assumptions must be made concerning the origin of the SSB terms. One such assumption is GMSB. In GMSB the _observable sector_**O** containing the Standard Model fields communicates with a _messenger sector_**M** usually built up by GUT preserving gauge fields. **M** then mediates the SSB by overlapping with a rather unspecified _secluded sector_**S**

\[\mathbf{O}\stackrel{{ SU(5),SU(10)..}}{{\longleftarrow}}\mathbf{M} \stackrel{{ X}}{{\longleftarrow}}\mathbf{S}\]

This automatically generates small flavor violations and preserves Grand Unification. In the minimal version of GMSB (mGMSB) the model is highly predictive and fully determined by only six parameters:

* \(\Lambda_{m}=F_{m}/M_{m}\), the effective SUSY breaking scale. Here chosen to be 30 TeV.
* \(M_{m}\), the messenger scale. The messenger scale it set to 250 TeV.
* \(N_{5}\), the parameterization of the \(SU(5)\) messenger fields. Here \(N_{5}\) is set to 3.
* \(\tan\beta\), the ratio of the Higgs vacuum expectation values at the electroweak scale.
* sgn \(\mu\), the sign of the Higgsino mass term. Here sgn \(\mu\) = +1
* \(C_{grav}\), the gravitino mass scaling factor.

Throughout this analysis the GMSB events are generated by the GMSB implementation in ISA JET 7.48 [5]. The major theoretical arguments at the moment against GMSB are the origin of the Higgs parameters \(\mu\) and \(B\) see [1], which in mGMSB are assumed to be determined at the EW-scale, and the somewhat ad hoc use of gauge fields.

## 3 Phenomenology

### The NLSP and the mass spectrum

The dominant SUSY production in a high energy hadron collider is through glue and quark interactions into gluino or squark pairs [6]. However, there is also an interesting contribution from prompt neutralino, chargino and slepton production [7]. Due to the imposed R parity the sparticles will be pair produced and decay down to the LSP. The LSP in mGMSB models is a very light gravitino for any relevant value of the fundamental SSB scale \(F\sim C_{grav}F_{m}\)

\[m_{{}_{\tilde{G}}}=\frac{F}{\sqrt{3}M_{P}}\leq 1\mathrm{keV}\,,\]

where \(M_{P}\) is the reduced Planck mass. This is expected since the model is constructed to keep flavor violations small and hence gravitational effects must be suppressed. The upper bound on \(m_{{}_{\tilde{G}}}\) actually comes from cosmology [1]. For most of the parameter space the NLSP is either a \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\), co-NLSP \(\hat{l}_{R}\), a \(\hat{\tau}_{1}\) or \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) and \(\hat{\tau}_{1}\) co-NLSP. In a very small corner of parameter space \(\hat{\nu}\) NLSP is also possible. An inverted case with the \(\tilde{g}\) as NLSP happens when \(M_{m}\) is very very large. For the parameters in this analysis the NLSP is either \(\hat{\tau}_{1}\) (G3) or co-NLSP \(\hat{l}_{R}\) (G2), see Table 1.

The models G2a and G2b were investigated in [2]. The sleptons are co-NLSP in this case and decay close to vertex for \(C_{grav}=1\) or outside the detector when the gravitino mass is rescaled. As \(\tan\beta\) is increased the \(\hat{\tau}_{1}\) becomes the NLSP due to the mixing effects proportional to \(m_{{}_{\tau}}\). The other SUSY mass differences due to the shift in \(\tan\beta\) appears to be of less phenomenological importance. For a comparison between ISA JET sparticle masses in model G2 and G3 see Table 2.

The connection between the model parameters and the physical mass spectrum is according to [1] at leading order proportional to \(N_{5}\Lambda_{m}\) for the gaugino masses, and \(\sqrt{N_{5}}\Lambda_{m}\) for the slepton masses. There is also an overall logarithmic dependence on \(M_{m}\) due to the boundary conditions for the RGEs.

### Topology

Typical signatures at the end of the decay chain for the G2 and G3 models are

**G2**: \[\begin{array}{lclcl}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}&\rightarrow&\hat{\mu}_{R}^{\pm}& \mu^{\mp}\\ &&\big{|}&&\\ &&\rightarrow&\tilde{G}&\mu^{\pm}\end{array}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l} \hline Point & \(\Lambda_{m}\) (TeV) & \(M_{m}\) (TeV) & \(N_{5}\) & \(\tan\beta\) & sgn \(\mu\) & \(C_{grav}\) \\ \hline G2a & 30 & 250 & 3 & 5 & + & 1 \\ G2b & 30 & 250 & 3 & 5 & + & 5000 \\ G3a & 30 & 250 & 3 & 12 & + & 1 \\ G3b & 30 & 250 & 3 & 12 & + & 5000 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The GMSB model parameters. For the long lived NLSP case the decay is disabled via the ISA JET option NOGRAV.

**G 3**: \[\begin{array}{ccccccccc}\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}&\rightarrow&\tilde{\mu}_{R}^{\,\pm }&\mu^{\mp}\\ &&\big{|}&&\\ &\rightarrow&\tilde{\tau}_{1}&\mu^{\,\pm}&(\tau)\\ &&\big{|}&&\\ &&\rightarrow&\tilde{G}&\tau\end{array}\]

Due to the \(\tilde{G}\) all GMSB scenarios produce missing \(E_{T}\). One exception is when the NLSP is quasi-stable, charged, reconstructed and included in the \(E_{T}\) calculation. In this study the quasi-stable NLSP is included. If the NLSP is charged and quasi-stable its mass and momentum can be fully reconstructed in the muon system and the background in that environment is not an issue.

The signature for the G 3 models unconditionally involves \(\tau\) which makes the detection more challenging compared to the G2 case. The decay mode at the end of the decay chain is either of the type

\[\tilde{\mu}_{R}^{\,\pm}(\tilde{e}_{R}^{\,\pm})\rightarrow\tilde{\tau}_{1}+\mu ^{\,\pm}(e^{\pm})+\tau \tag{1}\]

when the \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) decays outside the detector, or if the \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) lifetime is very short

\[\tilde{\tau}_{1}^{\,\pm}\rightarrow\tau^{\,\pm}+\tilde{G} \tag{2}\]

Due to the limited phase-space in the decay (1), the \(\tau\) lepton is undetectable.

A very large fraction of the events contains the decay

\[\tilde{\chi}^{0}\rightarrow\tilde{\mu}_{R}^{\,\pm}(\tilde{e}_{R}^{\,\pm})+\mu ^{\,\mp}(e^{\mp}) \tag{3}\]

which provides a very clear same flavor opposite charge (SOC) dilepton signal. The SOC results in sharp mass edges (see appendix A) and also removes most of the light QCD background. By forming the flavor combination

\[\mu^{\,+}\mu^{\,-}+e^{+}e^{-}-\mu^{\pm}e^{\mp} \tag{4}\]

a lot of the combinatorial background can be subtracted.

A standard handle on the SUSY signals is \(M_{\rm eff}\). \(M_{\rm eff}\) is defined as

\[M_{\rm eff}=\max_{|\!|\!|\tilde{\nu}_{T_{\rm eff},i}|}\sum_{i}^{4}|\tilde{p}_{ T_{\rm eff},i}|+E_{T_{\rm min}}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c c} \hline Particle & G2 & G3 & Particle & G2 & G3 & Particle & G2 & G3 \\ \hline \(\tilde{g}\) & 699 & 699 & & & & & \\ \(\tilde{u}_{L}\) & 658 & 658 & \(\tilde{u}_{R}\) & 635 & 635 & \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) & 113.9 & 115.5 \\ \(\tilde{d}_{L}\) & 662 & 662 & \(\tilde{d}_{R}\) & 634 & 634 & \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) & 196.2 & 196.1 \\ \(\tilde{t}_{2}\) & 674 & 672 & \(\tilde{t}_{1}\) & 577 & 582 & \(\tilde{\chi}_{3}^{0}\) & 277 & 265 \\ \(\tilde{b}_{2}\) & 640 & 644 & \(\tilde{b}_{1}\) & 631 & 626 & \(\tilde{\chi}_{4}^{0}\) & 329.9 & 316.5 \\ \(\tilde{e}_{L}\) & 204.1 & 204.5 & \(\tilde{e}_{R}\) & 102.7 & 103.3 & \(\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\,\pm}\) & 191.8 & 193.0 \\ \(\tilde{\tau}_{2}\) & 204 & 207 & \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) & 101.6 & 97.4 & \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{\,\pm}\) & 328 & 316 \\ \(\tilde{\nu}\) & 189 & 188 & \(\tilde{\nu}_{\tau}\) & 189 & 188 & & & \\ \(h^{0}\) & 106 & 111 & \(H^{0}\) & 337 & 311 & & & \\ \(A^{0}\) & 334 & 311 & \(H^{\,\pm}\) & 344 & 321 & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

background compared to signal are shown in Figure 1. The number of plotted events are always rescaled to 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) and hence the statistical fluctuations are equal or larger than expected.

### Trigger

The signal has a fairly high probability to pass the trigger due to the presence of very high \(P_{T}\) jets, see e.g. the leading jet variable in Figure 1, and large amount of missing energy. The results given by ATLFAST for the standard trigger menu options XE 50+J50 and J180 are shown in Table 4. To extract the relevant efficiences for the LVL1 XE trigger which only uses the calorimeter information, muons were removed at the generator output. The numbers within parenthesis includes the muon refinement, i.e. standard ATLFAST behaviour. XE 50 represents missing \(E_{T}\) above 50 GeV, and J180 represents jets above 180 GeV. For prompt production in G3a, the trigger criteria \(\tau\) 20+XE 30 combined with a jet veto was investigated. The acceptance for prompt production with this trigger was found to be 9%.

Since the trigger efficiences are so high for both models, a 100% trigger efficiency is assumed in the rest of the analysis. It also gives a conservative estimate of the background.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline Channel & XE 50 + J50[\%] & J180[\%] \\ \hline G3a & 92 & 83 \\ G3b & 92 (62) & 87, 0.005 Hz \\ \(t\bar{t}\) & 56 (31) & 5 (7), 0.01 Hz \\ Wj(\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 20 GeV) & 4 & 0.7 \\ Zj(\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 20 GeV) & 6 & 0.6 \\ WW,WZ,ZZ & 10 & 1.3 \\ QCD(\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 50 GeV) & 0.05 & 0.5, 100 Hz \\ \(b\bar{b}\)(\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 50 GeV) & 1.3 (0.7) & 0.4 (0.6) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Fraction of the events that pass the trigger criteria. The results are from ATLFAST with information only from the calorimeters as is the case for the LVL1 trigger. The equivalent trigger rates are indicated in a few cases. The muon system refined fraction are shown within parentheses. No detector efficiencies are included. Note that the true trigger rates are higher since no pile-up is included in the simulation, at least a factor of five is expected e.g. for the XE 50 trigger. The estimates for the high \(P_{T}\) trigger should however be more reliable.

\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \hline Channel & \(\sigma\)[pb] & Events prod. & Events simu. \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & 580 (833 [9]) & 5.8M & 400k \\ Wj(\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 20 GeV) & 35000 & 350M & 200k \\ Zj(\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 20 GeV) & 580 & 5.8M & 200k \\ WW,WZ,ZZ & 65 & 650k & 200k \\ QCD(\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 50 GeV) & \(23\cdot 10^{6}\) & \(2.3\cdot 10^{11}\) & 300k \\ \(b\bar{b}\)(\(p_{T}\)\(>\) 50 GeV) & 88000 & 880M & 300k \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 1: Variables that can be used to control the SM background. The signal is also included in the plots for comparison. It is quite obvious that \(t\vec{t}\) is the most dangerous background. Meff is defined as the scalar sum of the four leading jets plus Ptmiss. The number of events shown in the plot are events reconstructed in the detector, but without trigger efficiencies.

### Detection

#### 4.3.1 Ordinary particles

The response of the ATLAS detector is simulated by fast parameterizations using the ATLFAST package [10]. The default settings are used. That is, the acceptance is limited to \(|\eta|<2.5\), and reliable results should be expected for ordinary particles since the \(E_{T}\) thresholds are conservative: \(\gamma>5\) GeV, \(e^{\pm}>5\) GeV and \(\mu^{\pm}>6\) GeV. Jets are reconstructed with an R=0.4 cone after binning and smearing the fragmented generator particles according to the calorimeter performance. The jet threshold is \(P_{T}>15\) GeV. The \(\mu\) and \(e\) reconstruction efficiency is assumed to be 100%. Note that in the ATLFAST muon trigger simulation, parameterized muon efficiencies are included but not used since 100% trigger efficiency is assumed.

#### 4.3.2 Tau particles

The tau particles are reconstructed by the hadronic decay modes using standard ATLFAST tau jet isolation criteria The efficiency and jet rejection are parameterized using the result from a separate tau study [11] where full simulation of both calorimeter isolation and inner tracker constraints are used. The parameterization is \(p_{T}\) dependent. E.g. for \(15<p_{T}<30\) GeV a 60% efficiency gives a jet rejection of 10. Here the tau efficiency is fixed to 60%. The modified ATLFAST results for \(M_{\tau\tau}\) and \(\delta M_{\tau\tau}\) from \(Z\) decays were found to be compatible with the full simulation results in [12].

#### 4.3.3 Quasi-stable charged sleptons

The detection of the quasi-stable \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) is parameterized using the results in [14] and is implemented into ATLFAST. Effects of the sagitta measurement, multiple scattering and energy loss fluctuations are taken into account. For a mass measurement (\(m_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}}=p/(\beta\gamma)\)) \(\beta\) is limited to \(0.8<\beta<0.91\), see Figure 2. At \(\beta=0.85\) the \(\beta\) measurement contribution to the resolution is 10% and the momentum contribution 3%, the two terms are independent. The lower bound on \(\beta\) comes from a very conservative estimate of the time window in the trigger chambers needed for the second coordinate [13], and the upper bound from the cut on time of flight needed to reject the muons at the three sigma level [14]. Thus \(m_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}}\) can be measured down to the level of the estimated 0.1% systematic effects due to the high statistics given by 60k of \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). Once \(m_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}}\) is constrained the upper bound on \(\beta\) can be relaxed. 90% reconstruction efficiency is assumed within the acceptance.

## 5 Model G3b

In this model the \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) is a quasi-stable NLSP and it decays outside of the detector. The golden event signature is a very heavy charged particle in the muon system. Virtually no standard model background is present when an additional lepton is required in the event. As described in the previous section, the \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) mass is measured independently in the muon system. This enables the momentum resolution to be vastly improved by a mass constraint. Since everything in the decay chain \(\chi^{0}_{1,2}\to l^{+}\tilde{l}^{-}_{R}\to l^{+}l^{-}\tilde{\tau}_{1}(\tau)\) is well measured except for the very soft \(\tau\), the reconstruction is almost trivial.

### Slepton reconstruction

Only the lowest mass combination is kept in order to reduce the combinatorial background. No charge information is useful here due to the unmeasurable \(\tau\) lepton. The raw invariantmass spectrum for \(M_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}l}\) is shown in Figure 3. After adding the missing \(\tau\) mass to \(M_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}l}\) it should equal the \(\tilde{l}_{R}\) mass. A fit of the function

\[f(x)=\frac{a+b(x-M)}{1+e^{c(x-M)}}+d \tag{7}\]

to the edge in the mass spectrum yields

\[M_{\tilde{l}_{R}}=M_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}l}+M_{\tau}=103.3\,\pm\,0.05\ \mathrm{GeV} \tag{8}\]

where the error is the statistical error from the fit. Within the validity of the fitted function, the result is robust with respect to the mass window.

### Neutralino reconstruction

The \(\chi^{0}_{1,2}\) masses can either be found directly from \(M_{\tilde{l}_{R}^{-l+}}\), i.e. just continue to reconstruct the next particle in the decay chain as is shown in Figure 4, or indirectly from \(M_{\tilde{l}^{+}l-}\) as is shown in in Figure 5. The \(M_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}\) is well determined from \(M_{\tilde{l}_{R}^{-}}\) with the slepton selected from Figure 3 within the mass window 101-104 GeV. The result from a fit to the same function as in Figure 3 gives

\[M_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}=M_{\tilde{l}_{R}l}+M_{\tau}=115.3\ \mathrm{GeV}\,\pm 0.1\ \mathrm{GeV}, \tag{9}\]

The result in insensitive to the selected mass window. \(M_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}}\) seems to be better determined from the dilepton spectrum. For an introduction to effective invariant masses see appendix A. Edges in the dilepton spectrum are expected at

\[M_{ll}^{max} = M_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}\sqrt{1-\frac{M_{\tilde{l}_{R}}^{2}}{M_ {\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}^{2}}}\sqrt{1-\frac{(M_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}}+M_{\tau})^{2} }{M_{\tilde{l}_{R}}^{2}}}=14.5\ \mathrm{GeV}\ (14.3\pm 0.05\ \mathrm{GeV}), \tag{10}\]

and at

\[M_{ll}^{max}=M_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}}\sqrt{1-\frac{M_{\tilde{l}_{R}}^{2}}{M_ {\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}}^{2}}}\sqrt{1-\frac{(M_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}}+M_{\tau})^{2} }{M_{\tilde{l}_{R}}^{2}}}=46.8\ \mathrm{GeV}\ (46.2\pm 0.3\ \mathrm{GeV}). \tag{11}\]

Figure 2: Velocity distribution for \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\).

The fitted function consists of two first order polynomials. The statistical error is very small, hence the dominating error is due to the uncertainty in the shape of the background subtracted signal. Please note that all figures containing dilepton pairs are improved by the flavor subtraction \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}+e^{+}e^{-}-\mu^{\pm}e^{\mp}\).

### Squark reconstruction

The \(\tilde{q}_{L,R}\) masses can be extracted from edges in the invariant mass spectrum \(M_{llj}\). The dominant decay is \(\tilde{q}_{R}\to\chi^{0}_{1}q\), see the left plot in Figure 6. The events are selected by requiring \(M_{ll}<15\) GeV, \(P_{Tll}>65\) GeV, 2 jets with \(P_{T}>25\) GeV and 2 jets with \(P_{T}>50\) GeV. The right plot in Figure 6 also shows the spectrum \(M_{llj}\), but with 15 GeV \(<M_{ll}<4\) GeV. Then the dominant decay is \(\tilde{q}_{L}\to\chi^{0}_{2}q\). The expected edges are

\[M_{llj}^{max}=M_{\tilde{q}_{R}}\sqrt{1-\frac{M_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}^{2}}{M_{ \tilde{q}_{R}}^{2}}}\sqrt{1-\frac{(M_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}}+M_{\tau})^{2}}{M_{ \tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}^{2}}}=320\ \mbox{GeV}\ (316\pm 3\ \mbox{GeV}), \tag{12}\]

and

\[M_{llj}^{max}=M_{\tilde{q}_{L}}\sqrt{1-\frac{M_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}}^{2}}{M_{ \tilde{q}_{L}}^{2}}}\sqrt{1-\frac{(M_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}}+M_{\tau})^{2}}{M_{ \tilde{\chi}^{0}_{2}}^{2}}}=546\ \mbox{GeV}\ (539\pm 5\ \mbox{GeV}). \tag{13}\]

The masses within parenthesis are from the fit. The errors are errors from the fit generously rounded upwards. The estimation is based on values taken from several fits within different regions and different sets of data. Errors from absolute energy scale calibrations are not included. Given the six mass measurements, it is easy to solve for the six masses.

Figure 3: Minimal invariant mass spectrum for a stau and a lepton (\(M_{\tau_{l}l}\)). The \(\tilde{l}_{R}\) mass is extracted from the edge in the three-body decay. The fitted function is a first order polynomial times a sigmoid plus a constant background. The fit yields: \(M_{\tilde{l}_{R}}=M_{\tau_{1}l}+M_{\tau}=103.3\pm 0.05\) GeV.

Figure 4: Invariant mass spectrum \(M_{\tilde{l}_{R}^{+}l_{-}}\) for a slepton and a lepton. The lepton is required to have the opposite charge as the reconstructed slepton charge. The result from the fit is: \(M_{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}=M_{\tilde{l}_{R}^{l}l}+M_{\tau}=11\,5.3\pm 0.1\) GeV (left plot). The \(M_{\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{0}}\) is also visible in the spectrum (right plot), but the mass seems to be better determined from the dilepton spectrum, see Figure 5.

Figure 5: The dilepton invariant mass spectrum \(M_{ll}\). Fits to the edges yield the result: \(M_{ll}=14.3\pm 0.05\) GeV, and \(M_{ll}=46.2\pm 0.3\) GeV.

Figure 6: Invariant mass for a dilepton pair and a jet. The left plot shows \(M_{llj}\) for \(M_{ll}\) with a \(P_{T}<1\) GeV. The decay is dominated by \(\tilde{q}_{R}\to\chi_{1}^{0}q\). The right plots shows \(M_{llj}\) for \(M_{ll}\) with a \(15<P_{T}<46\) GeV. This cut enhances the decay \(\tilde{q}_{L}\to\chi_{2}^{0}q\).

### Proof of the NSLP flavor

In the G3b model one cannot prove the flavor of the NLSP unless the soft tau is found. Since the \(p_{T}\) of the \(\tau\) is so low it will be very hard to find it the calorimeter. However, apart from the soft tau everything else is measurable. Thus, after three sparticle masses have been determined in the decay chain, the tau momentum can be solved by imposing the mass constraints, see appendix B for details.

Three masses and four 4-vectors are needed in order to fix the soft \(\tau\) momentum. A powerful candidate for this type of the decay chain is \(\tilde{l}_{L}\to\chi_{1}^{0}l\to\tilde{l}_{R}^{-}l^{+}l\to\tilde{\tau}_{1}(\tau )l^{-}l^{+}l\) since leptons are easy to measure. A very simple test of the technique has been done assuming perfect knowledge of the reconstructed sparticle masses. This is not a bad approximation judging from the results in the previous sections if the systematic affect are under control, but the robustness against mass errors remains to be tested. The solution in appendix B has been implemented and applied on the events from ATLFAST. The particles are reconstructed in the same way as is described in the previous sections by successive bottom-up reconstruction of the decay chain. The \(\tilde{l}_{L}\) was selected within a mass window of \(\pm\) 6 GeV. To get a hint of the performance, the opening angle between the true \(\vec{\tau}\) vector and the mass constrained estimation \(\vec{\tau}^{*}\) is shown in Figure 7. The vector \(\vec{\tau}\) could e.g. be replaced with tau vertex candidates from the inner tracker and a correlation of the type seen in Figure 7 would constitute a definite proof of the NLSP flavor.

## 6 Model G3a

In the G 3a model the NLSP is assumed to decay close to the vertex. As a result, no SUSY particle is directly detectable. This is in big contrast to the G3b model where the quasi-stable NLSP gives a clear distinctive signal in the muon system. Absence of new particles of course makes the experimental situation a lot more difficult. However, a large amount of missing transverse energy is still generated due to the LSP, and the squark and gluino production will also help in the identification due to the enhanced jet multiplicity. In order to reject the SM background the following general cuts have been applied on all events

Figure 7: The plot shows \(\cos\theta\) for the opening angle \(\theta\) between the true tau momentum vector \(\vec{\tau}\) and the tau momentum vector \(\vec{\tau}^{*}\) estimated from a mass constrained decay chain.

* 4 jets with \(P_{T}>\) 25 GeV, jets identified as \(\tau\)-jets are not included.
* At least one pair of same flavor opposite signed leptons.
* \(M_{eff}>\) 300 GeV.
* \(E_{T_{miss}}/M_{eff}>0.1\).

At the end of the decay chain we find a very hard tau. The most efficient reconstruction of the tau turns out to be via the hadronic decay modes. Hence only taus decaying into hadrons are used.

The decay chain is the same as in G3b, but with the difference that the \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) now decays into \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\rightarrow\tilde{G}\tau\). The complete investigated decay chain looks like \(\tilde{q}_{R}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1,2}q\rightarrow\tilde{l}_{R}^{-}l^ {+}q\rightarrow\tilde{\tau}_{1}(\tau)l^{-}l^{+}q\rightarrow\tilde{G}\tau(\tau) l^{-}l^{+}q\). The \((\tau)\) is once again not detectable in the calorimeter due to the limited available phase-space. The lepton from the \(\tilde{l}_{R}\)-decay is very soft but detectable. The average \(p_{T}\) is 10 GeV, and a cut is made at 15 Gev such that soft leptons are selected below this energy. The \(p_{T}\) of the tau is required to be larger than 75 GeV. The invariant mass \(M_{\tau l}\) for the minimal mass combination is shown in Figure 8. The first edge is expected at

\[M_{\tau l}^{max}=\sqrt{M_{\tilde{l}_{R}}^{2}-(M_{\tilde{\tau}_{1}}+M_{\tau})^ {2}}=29.0\,\,\,\mbox{GeV}\,\,(29.2\pm 1\,\,\mbox{GeV}) \tag{14}\]

when a soft lepton is selected, see the left plot in Figure 8. When selecting hard leptons with \(p_{T}>\) 15 GeV an edge is expected at

\[M_{\tau l}^{max}=\sqrt{M_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}}^{2}-M_{\tilde{l}_{R}}^{2}}=51.7\,\,\mbox{GeV}\,\,(51.1\pm 1\,\,\mbox{GeV}), \tag{15}\]

see the right plot in Figure 8. The plots are surprisingly free of SM background. Very powerful are the dilepton and hard tau requirement. Please note that the statistics is too low, e.g. a factor 10 for \(t\overline{t}\). Hence the fluctuations are too large to represent the real background. Proper statistics should only improve the situation. The edges for \(M_{ll}\) and \(M_{llj}\) are the same as in G3b. However for the SOC dilepton spectrum the background is more complicated. The background under the signal is not flat and causes a systematic shift of the second edge. In order to reduce the background an extra requirement of at least one tau with \(p_{T}>\) 65 GeV is applied. The results from the dilepton and dilepton plus jet fits are

\[M_{ll}^{max}=14.5\,\,\mbox{GeV}\,\,(14.3\pm 0.1\,\,\,\mbox{GeV}),\]

\[M_{ll}^{max}=46.8\,\,\mbox{GeV}\,\,(42.3\pm 5\,\,\mbox{GeV}),\]

and

\[M_{llj}^{max}=320\,\,\,\mbox{GeV}\,\,(313\pm 6\,\,\mbox{GeV}),\]

\[M_{llj}^{max}=546\,\,\,\mbox{GeV}\,\,(530\pm 5\,\,\mbox{GeV}),\]

The measured endpoint is systematically lower in many cases. This is expected to some extent since taus and jets leak out of the cone. The tau also has an unmeasured neutrino.

At this point, just as in model G3b, we now have enough mass relations to solve for six unknown masses which enables us to do a fit for the most probable model parameters.

Conclusions

The signals from GMSB models with \(\tilde{\tau}_{1}\) as the NLSP have been investigated. Both the case with a quasi-stable NALP (G3b), and the case with a NLSP decaying close to the vertex (G3b). The G3b model can be fully reconstructed with good mass resolution similar to related models studied previously [2]. The G3a model is harder than G3b from an experimental point of view due to the fact that the decay chain reconstruction is based on tau leptons in the final state. However, also in this case can masses of sleptons, neutralinos and squarks be determined with a precision of the order of GeV, and few GeV for squarks. As in the case [2] a reasonable estimation of the model parameters should be possible from the measured masses.

## Acknowledgments

I want to thank Ian Hinchliffe and Frank Paige for proposing this study. Frank helped me several times with ISAJET. Ian has been very helpful with ideas and answering questions, especially during my stay at Berkeley Labs. Giacomo Polesello provided a lot of the information on the quasi-stable stau resolution, and also guided me during the initial phase of the background simulations.

Effective mass kinematics in decay chains

One of the basic tools in SUSY measurements are edges in the effective mass spectrum. These masses can be formed from squares of arbitrary 4-vectors at different stages in the decay chain. As an illustration I here derive the upper edge for the simplest possible non trivial effective mass, i.e.:

\[m_{BD}^{2}=(p_{B}+p_{D})^{2} \tag{16}\]

in the decay :

\[A\to B+C,C\to D+E \tag{17}\]

The derivation is general, but since it is used in the dilepton effective mass analysis, the leptons (B and D) are assumed to be massless. The equality sign indicates when this approximation is made. The first step is to find the momentum in the CM of the decaying particle:

\[(E_{B},\mathbf{\tilde{p}_{B}}) \leftarrow A\quad\rightarrow(E_{C},-\mathbf{\tilde{p}_{B}}) \tag{18}\] \[(E_{D}^{\prime},\mathbf{\tilde{p}_{D}^{\prime}}) \leftarrow C^{\prime}\quad\rightarrow(E_{E}^{\prime},-\mathbf{\tilde{p}_{D }^{\prime}}) \tag{19}\]

After expanding Equation (16) and solving for \(\vec{p}^{2}\) one finds

\[p\simeq\frac{m_{A}^{2}-m_{C}^{2}}{2m_{A}}. \tag{20}\]

Thus

\[E_{B}\simeq\frac{m_{A}^{2}-m_{C}^{2}}{2m_{A}}, \tag{21}\] \[E_{C}\simeq\frac{m_{A}^{2}+m_{C}^{2}}{2m_{A}}. \tag{22}\]

The boost between the frames is then simply

\[\beta=\frac{m_{A}^{2}-m_{C}^{2}}{m_{A}^{2}+m_{C}^{2}}, \tag{23}\] \[\gamma=\frac{m_{A}^{2}-m_{C}^{2}}{2m_{A}m_{C}}. \tag{24}\]

By boosting to the unprimed system one finds

\[E_{D}=\gamma E_{D}^{\prime}+\gamma\beta E_{D}^{\prime}=\frac{m_{C}^{2}-m_{E}^{ 2}}{2m_{C}^{2}}m_{A} \tag{25}\]

The upper edge in the effective mass can now be found when \(B\) and \(D\) are back-to-back

\[\max\mbox{$m_{BD}^{2}$}=4E_{B}E_{D}=m_{A}^{2}(1-\frac{m_{C}^{2}}{m_{A}^{2}})(1 -\frac{m_{E}^{2}}{m_{C}^{2}}) \tag{26}\]

The same technique can be used to construct more complex effective masses.

Mass constraints

Given three masses in a decay chain it is possible to reconstruct the momentum of one of the decay products. This solution is due to [2] but is given here explicitly for the generic case. The reconstructed momentum is solved for \(\vec{p_{1}}\). The equation system is:

\[(p_{0}+p_{1}+p_{2})^{2} = M_{1}^{2} \tag{27}\] \[(p_{0}+p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3})^{2} = M_{2}^{2}\] (28) \[(p_{0}+p_{1}+p_{2}+p_{3}+p_{4})^{2} = M_{3}^{2} \tag{29}\]

Expand the squared 4-vectors and collect \(\vec{p_{1}}\) on the left hand side by subtracting the equations (\(E_{a}\equiv E_{0}+E_{2}\), \(\vec{p_{a}}\equiv\vec{p_{0}}+\vec{p_{2}}\)):

\[2E_{1}E_{a}-2\vec{p_{1}}\cdot\vec{p_{a}} = M_{1}^{2}-m_{0}^{2}-m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2}-2E_{0}E_{2}+2\vec{p_{0}} \cdot\vec{p_{2}}=C_{1} \tag{30}\] \[2E_{1}E_{3}-2\vec{p_{1}}\cdot\vec{p_{3}} = M_{2}^{2}-M_{1}^{2}-m_{3}^{2}-2E_{0}E_{3}-2E_{2}E_{3}+\] (31) \[2\vec{p_{0}}\cdot\vec{p_{3}}+2\vec{p_{2}}\cdot\vec{p_{3}}=C_{2}\] \[2E_{1}E_{4}-2\vec{p_{1}}\cdot\vec{p_{4}} = M_{3}^{2}-M_{2}^{2}-m_{4}^{2}-2E_{0}E_{4}-2E_{2}E_{4}-2E_{3}E_{4}+\] (32) \[2\vec{p_{0}}\cdot\vec{p_{4}}+2\vec{p_{2}}\cdot\vec{p_{4}}+2\vec {p_{3}}\cdot\vec{p_{4}}=C_{3}\]

We want \(\vec{p_{1}}\) alone on the left hand side. \(E_{1}(|\vec{p_{1}}|)\) is eliminated by subtraction:

\[(\ref{eq:1})\cdot E_{3}-(\ref{eq:1})\cdot E_{a} \Rightarrow(2\vec{p_{3}}E_{a}-2\vec{p_{a}}E_{3})\cdot\vec{p_{1}} =E_{3}C_{1}-E_{a}C_{2}\Rightarrow\vec{D_{1}}\cdot\vec{p_{1}}=F_{1} \tag{33}\] \[(\ref{eq:1})\cdot E_{4}-(\ref{eq:1})\cdot E_{3} \Rightarrow(2\vec{p_{4}}E_{3}-2\vec{p_{3}}E_{4})\cdot\vec{p_{1}} =E_{4}C_{2}-E_{3}C_{3}\Rightarrow\vec{D_{2}}\cdot\vec{p_{1}}=F_{2} \tag{34}\]

Given two linear equations we can now find a solution for e.g. \(p_{1x}\) and \(p_{1y}\)

\[D_{1x}p_{1x}+D_{1y}p_{1y}+D_{1z}p_{1z}=F_{1}\] \[D_{2x}p_{1x}+D_{2y}p_{1y}+D_{2z}p_{1z}=F_{2} \tag{35}\] \[\left(\begin{array}{cc}D_{1x}&D_{1y}\\ D_{2x}&D_{2y}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}p_{1x}\\ p_{1y}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}{cc}F_{1}&-D_{1z}\\ F_{2}&-D_{2z}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}1\\ p_{1z}\end{array}\right)\Rightarrow\] (36) \[\left(\begin{array}{cc}p_{1x}\\ p_{1y}\end{array}\right)=\frac{1}{D_{1x}D_{2y}-D_{1y}D_{2x}}\left(\begin{array} []{cc}D_{2y}&-D_{1y}\\ -D_{2x}&D_{1x}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}F_{1}&-D_{1z}\\ F_{2}&-D_{2z}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{cc}1\\ p_{1z}\end{array}\right)\Rightarrow\] (37) \[\left\{\mathbf{A}=\frac{1}{D_{1x}D_{2y}-D_{1y}D_{2x}}\left( \begin{array}{cc}D_{2y}F_{1}-D_{1y}F_{2}&-D_{2y}D_{1z}+D_{1y}D_{2z}\\ -D_{2x}F_{1}+D_{1x}F_{2}&D_{2x}D_{1z}-D_{1x}D_{2z}\end{array}\right)\right\}\] (38) \[p_{1x}=A_{11}+A_{12}p_{1z}\] \[p_{1y}=A_{21}+A_{22}p_{1z} \tag{39}\]

This solution is then plugged into equation (30) and squared to avoid the square root in the expression for the energy

\[2E_{1}E_{a} = C_{1}+2\vec{p_{1}}\cdot\vec{p_{a}}\Rightarrow \tag{40}\] \[E_{1}^{2}E_{a}^{2} = C_{1}^{2}/4+(\vec{p_{1}}\cdot\vec{p_{a}})^{2}+C_{1}\vec{p_{1}} \cdot\vec{p_{a}}\] (41) \[(p_{1x}^{2}+p_{1y}^{2}+p_{1z}^{2}+m_{1}^{2})E_{a}^{2} = C_{1}^{2}/4+(p_{1x}p_{ax}+p_{1y}p_{ay}+p_{1z}p_{az})^{2}+\] (42) \[C_{1}(p_{1x}p_{ax}+p_{1y}p_{ay}+p_{1z}p_{az})\]Once the solution for \(p_{1\,x}\) and \(p_{1\,y}\) is plugged in it gets kind of messy, but it is just an ordinary quadratic equation in \(p_{1\,z}\).

\[-(A_{11}^{2}\,+A_{12}^{2}p_{1\,z}^{2}+2A_{1\,1}A_{12}p_{1\,z}+A_{2 \,1}^{2}+A_{22}^{2}p_{1\,z}^{2}+2A_{21}A_{22}p_{1\,z}+p_{1\,z}^{2}+m_{1}^{\,2})E _{a}^{2}+\] \[C_{1}^{2}/4\,+(A_{11}^{2}+A_{12}^{2}p_{1\,z}^{2}+2A_{11}A_{12}p_{ 1\,z})\,p_{ax}^{2}+(A_{21}^{2}+A_{22}^{2}p_{1\,z}^{2}+2A_{21}A_{22}p_{1\,z})p_{ a\,y}^{2}+\] \[p_{1\,z}^{2}p_{az}^{2}\,+2(A_{1\,1}A_{21}+A_{11}A_{22}p_{1\,z}+A_ {12}A_{21}p_{1\,z}+A_{12}A_{22}p_{1\,z}^{2})p_{ax}p_{a\,y}+\] \[2(A_{11}\,+A_{12}p_{1\,z})p_{ax}p_{1\,z}+2(A_{21}+A_{22}p_{1\,z}) p_{a\,y}p_{1\,z}p_{az}+\] \[C_{1}\left[(A_{11}+A_{12}p_{1\,z})p_{ax}+(A_{21}+A_{22}p_{1\,z}) p_{ay}+p_{1\,z}p_{az}\right]\] \[=0 \tag{43}\]

After coefficient identification the final solution reads

\[p_{1\,z} = \frac{-B_{1}\pm\sqrt{B_{1}^{2}-4B_{0}B_{2}}}{2B_{2}} \tag{44}\]

where

\[B_{0} = (-A_{11}^{2}-A_{21}^{2}-m_{1}^{\,2})E_{a}^{2}+C_{1}^{2}/4+A_{11}^ {2}p_{ax}^{2}+A_{21}^{2}p_{ay}^{2}+ \tag{45}\] \[2A_{11}A_{21}p_{ax}p_{ay}+C_{1}A_{11}p_{ax}+A_{21}p_{ay}\] \[B_{1} = 2(-A_{11}A_{12}-A_{21}A_{22})E_{a}^{2}+2A_{11}A_{12}p_{ax}^{2}+\] (46) \[2A_{21}A_{22}p_{ay}^{2}+2p_{ax}p_{ay}(A_{11}A_{22}+A_{12}A_{21})+\] \[2A_{11}p_{ax}p_{az}+2A_{21}p_{ay}p_{az}+C_{1}(A_{12}p_{ax}+A_{22} p_{ay}+p_{az})\] \[B_{2} = (-A_{12}^{2}-A_{22}^{2}-1)E_{a}^{2}+A_{12}^{2}p_{ax}^{2}+A_{22}^ {2}p_{ay}^{2}+\] (47) \[p_{az}^{2}+2A_{12}A_{22}p_{ax}p_{ay}+2A_{12}p_{ax}p_{az}+2A_{22} p_{ay}p_{az}\]
