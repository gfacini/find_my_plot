The Fresnel lens is one of the option for the end-cap e.m. calorimetry of ATLAS. The present paper describes the design and construction of a prototype built according to this idea and tested in the RD3 beam test facility at the SPS at CERN in November 1993, with in front a prototype of the preshower "a la RD3". The preliminary results obtained with this test beam in terms of energy and spatial resolution are discussed here.

**1.- INTRODUCTION**

The ATLAS collaboration has considered different alternatives to build the end-cap e.m. calorimetry. This is also a crucial part of the calorimeter, as it is well known that, as the energy in the c.m. increases, the range which needs to be covered is expanded in terms of pseudorapidity. To have a very performant e.m. detector in the intermediate values in rapidity becomes therefore very important.

The various options which have been worked out were three different LAr calorimeter options. One is the TGT option, implying thin gaps and parallel plates as proposed by the Munich group, the other one is the Fresnel lens or parallel option, the last one which is the one finally retained, is the spanish fan. The two last options are built following the Accordion technique. The "Spanishfan" offers the advantage of being symmetrical in azimuth, whereas the parallel option is relatively simple to build.

The principle and the construction of the prototype are described in Section 2. In Section 3 are explained the whole set of tests made to ensure the good working both of the detector and of its associated electronics. In Section 4 are summarized the preliminary results obtained with the data recorded during the November run, last year. These data suffer of the lack of statistics but already give an indication of the possible performances of such a detector. In conclusion we outline the interest and prospects of the forthcoming run in April 1994.

**2.- DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE FRESNEL LENS PROTOTYPE**

**2.1 Principle:**

The Fresnel lens follows the geometry of the central barrel, that is why it is also called the parallel prototype. The projective geometry is achieved by staggering one module with the next one, by one wavelength (1 \(\lambda\)); moreover, the back side is more opened in \(\theta\) (where \(\theta\) is the angle used to define the pseudorapidity) than the front side. This is clearly shown in Figure 1, where the design of the two adjacent modules of the Fresnel lens prototype is sketched, in (\(\theta\), Z) (where Z is the beam direction).

The pros of such a design are that

1) it is simple to build

2) it is already a well proven technology, as it is identical to the central barrel.

The cons are that

1) It is not \(\varphi\)-symmetrical (where \(\varphi\) is the azimuth)

2) It may occur some problem in the zone between two modules (due to the wavelength shift).

**2.2 Construction:**

The prototype built in our Lab is made of two modules; each module is made of wavelength in phase, constituted by 18 kaptons. And there is an alternation of kaptons and absorbers as shown in Fig. 2.

The kaptons are grouped by three in \(\theta\), making therefore 6 cells per module. There are three samplings in depth. The size of a cell is: 5.6 mrad in \(\theta\), 24 mm length in arc of the angle \(\varphi\) (\(\varphi\) being the azimuth) and 16.5 cm in average in depth.

The prototype has been made by reusing most of the material from a previous prototype.

The kaptons, the absorbers, the preamplifiers have been taken back from previous prototypes. The box which contains the prototype and the mother- and daughter- boards and the electronics cards for the H.V. and L.V. supplies and for the calibration system, are new.

**Fig. 1**_The Fresnel lens end-cap prototype:_ the principleThe two modules are put together with plates of brass. They are sitting in a box of total size 50 x 50 x 50 cm3 (Fig. 3). In front of the calorimeter is installed a prototype of the preshower "a la RD3" which is actually made by Grenoble. The box containing the Fresnel lens prototype has been built such as to include also the preshower prototype, as it is shown in Fig. 4.

### Front-end associated electronics:

The associated electronics consist of low-noise preamplifiers that are the ones made by BNL to equip parts of the LAr e.m. central barrel prototype. They are situated on the mother boards which have been CAD-designed in the Lab. The circuit for the calibration test pulse system as designed by the RD3 collaboration, is also located on these cards (see Fig. 5).

Moreover one has to provide the necessary H.V. (namely 2 kV) and L.V. (namely -3.5 V and +12 V) supplies through the corresponding power supply cards which also have been designed and installed on this prototype (see Fig.3 or 4).

3.- TESTS OF FUNCTIONING

The checks made to test the good working of both the detector and its associated electronics have been done in two stages. The first stage has occured during the construction of the prototype in the Lab. The second stage happened during the installation at the H8-SPS beam test at CERN.

3.1 Tests on the detector and its associated electronics during the construction

The tests have been made both on the kaptons and on the electronics.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:7]

The tests on the mother- and daughter- boards have been done, sending a liquid-Argon like pulse at the input of the cards, with a pulse-generator.

It firstly includes a verification of the routing in both types of cards. Secondly, the homogeneity of the response in time and in amplitude for all the channels of one card (each front mother-board contains 24 channels, i.e. preamplifiers; each back mother-board contains 36 channels). Each channel is pulsed with a signal of triangular shape, similar to the one of the LAr Accordion detector (400 nsec length). The obtained results are shown in Fig.8.

**3.2 Installation of the prototype in the test beam**

Both the Fresnel lens prototype and the spanish fan are tested at the same time, sharing the same beam line. They are installed on a platform, and can be moved following the \(Z\) and \(\theta\) directions, using a step-motor. They are alternately working. The Figure 9 shows the platform where both prototypes are installed, inside the cryostat.

The Figure 10 shows a photograph of the prototype once it has been mounted and inserted in the cryostat.

### Tests of the prototype after its installation at the SPS.

Once the prototype was installed in the experimental area, it has been submitted to the following set of tests before the beam starts.

Using the calibration test pulse system available from RD3, the complete electronic chain has been checked. The electronic set-up used for this purpose is sketched in Fig. 11.

First a rough test is made before the prototype is inserted in the cryostat. It allows to verify, with the test pulse system, that each preamplifier sitting on the mother boards is working: the test pulse is sent through the chain and one looks at the oscilloscope that the signal is properly transmitted from the output of the preamplifier.

Figure 10: Prototype on the H8-SPS test beam at CERNOnce the prototype is installed in the cryostat, one checks that the test pulse signal is properly transmitted up to the output of the shaper (see Fig.11). This means that both the response in time and amplitude is verified channel by channel at the output of the shaper. The obtained results have been recorded as curves and histograms which summarize the response in time and amplitude of all the channels of one mother-board. The Figure 12 shows an example of such an histogram.

### Conclusion

The analysis of the november 1993 run for the parallel prototype turned out to be relatively difficult due to the very low statistics and lots of unusable runs. However, the preliminary results look encouraging. This is particularly the case of the energy resolution with the preshower "a la RD3", taking into account that these results do not include noise studies, and corrections on the preshower data and that the cluster size is reduced to one cell in the calorimeter.

5- Conclusion

The prototype is presently set-up again for the RD3 run which just occurred from the 15th of April till May the 11th. The main aim was to record good and enough data in order to fully exploit the set-up formed by the Fresnel lens prototype with in front the preshower module "a la RD3".

This gives an unique chance to reproduce and test the alternative of such a preshower sitting in front of the e.m. central barrel of ATLAS. At the present time, where a crucial issue is to choose between the various alternatives for the ATLAS preshower, this is a real opportunity to make some progress in this way.

The statistics and the quality of the data we just recorded look much better then the ones of November.
