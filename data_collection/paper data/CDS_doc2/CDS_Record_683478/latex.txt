## 1 Introduction

Plastic scintillator modifies it's scintillation properties and transparency under irradiation. This modification depends essentially on the type of scintillator and have ruther complicated dynamic behaviour due to the processes of destruction and restoration (annealing) of it's chemical components.

To predict long term changes in scintillators performance under real experimental conditions, when irradiation lasts for a couple of years, one have to take data at much higher irradiation rate and to have some model on the rate dependence.

## 2 Experimental set-up and data

Scintillation tiles were produced by injection molding technique [1] at IHEP, Protvino for the construction of ATLAS Tile calorimeter prototype [2]. The components used for it's production were 1.5% of pTp and 0.04% of POPOP as primary and secondary WLS dyes and granulated polystyrene as a base.

To fit available for irradiation volume, these scintillators were cut to dimensions \(170\times 50\times 3mm^{3}\) with their edges polished. All the tiles were wrapped all around by Tyvek film. Irradiation was done by uniformely surrounding the volume \(Cs^{13}\) radioactive sources at the rate of 6 Rad/sec. The tiles were exposed at different dozes, from 65 kRad (3 hours of irradiation) to 1 MRad (2 days irradiation). In a few days after exposition, some tiles were exposed once more, just to compare e.g. 260 kRad exposition with 130+130 kRad ones.

Before and after irradiation the light yield for each tile was measured by the setup shown in Fig.1. Scintillation light was excited by collimated (4 mm in diameter) \(Sr^{80}\) source, then collected by Kuraray Y11 WLS fiber (not being irradiated), and DC of FEU-84 photomultiplier with green extended photocathode was measured. The measurements were done at five different positions over tiles length, at regular time intervals starting just after the end of irradiation. For the crosscheck, 3 tiles were exposed and measured for all but 1037 kRad accumulated dozens. The reproducibility of results was continously monitored by few reference tiles measurements. An estimated measurements accuracy is about 1%.

Some of raw data results are presented in Figs.2-3. One can see quick tiles recovery just after irradiation followed by some degradation and, finally stabilization. Quite surprisingly light yield just after irradiation practically do not depend on the doze, but do depend later.

## 3 Phenomenological model

The aim of proposed model is to provide meaningful parametrization of observed data ruther than to give real microscopic description of processes in plastic scintillators. Let \(L_{0}\) is the average length of polystyrene molecule which do energy transportation through over it's length. An excitation of molecules produced by ionization particles is then transported to dopants and leads to scintillation light. Irradiation of polystyrene leads to the creation of some break points along molecule, where the energy transportation is blocked. The ability for energy transportation at each blocked point restores with some time constant \(\tau\)

\[dN(t)/dt=k*I(t)-1/\tau*N(t)\]

Then, for the constant irradiation intensity \(I(t)=I\), the density of such "points" changes as

\[N(t)=k*I*\tau*(1-exp(-t/\tau))\]

and the average molecule length which do energy transportation is

\[L(t)=L(0)/\left(1+N(t)\right)\]

Figure 3: The dependence of relative light yield on the doze at x=13.5 cm. Left - in a few minutess after irradiation, right - in a few weeks after irradiation.

At the same time irradiation produces some "radicals" with density \(D(t)\) and life time \(\tau_{r}\)

\[dD(t)/dt=k_{r}*I-1/\tau_{r}*D(t)\qquad D(t)=k_{r}*I*\tau_{r}*(1-exp(-t/\tau_{r}))\]

By some mechanism these "radicals" kill scintillation centers. At the time \(t\) the density of such attached "radicals" is

\[N_{a}(t)=k_{a}*f_{0}^{t}D(t)dt=k_{a}*k_{r}*I*(t-\tau_{r}*(1-exp(-t/\tau_{r})))\]

and the density of alive scintillating centers is

\[N_{sc}(t)=N_{sc}(0)*exp(-N_{a}(t))\]

Taking together above formulas we come to the following expression for the time dependence of scintillation light yield \(S(t)\)

\[S(t)/S(0)=L(t)/L(0)*N_{sc}/N_{sc}(0)=\]

\[=exp(-k_{a}*k_{r}*I*(t-\tau_{r}*(1-exp(-t/\tau_{r})))/(1+k*I*\tau*(1-exp(-t/\tau )))\]

If irradiation stops at some moment \(t_{0}\), both values - the density of blocked points and the density of "radicals" decrease exponentially with time constants \(\tau\) and \(\tau_{r}\) respectively, that leads to the following expression for time dependence of scintillation light yield after irradiation

\[S(t)=S(0)*\]

\[*exp(-N_{a}(t_{0})-k_{a}*D(t_{0})*(1-exp(-(t-t_{0})/\tau_{r})))/(1+N(t_{0})* exp(-(t-t_{0})/\tau))\]

Four unknown coefficients in this expression (\(\tau\), \(\tau_{r}\), \(k\) and \(k_{1}=k_{a}*k_{r}\)) have to be defined from experimental data. The data at small distance from the point of scintillation to the fiber were fit by this expression. The result of this fit is shown in Fig.4.

With increasing the distance between scintillation point and the fiber, we have to take into account light attenuation in plastic as well. We will consider "direct" creation of light scatter centers under irradiation with their life time \(\tau_{i}\) (they may be of different types)

\[N_{i}(t)=k_{i}*I*\tau_{i}*(1-exp(-t/\tau_{i}))\]

and scatter centers which appear later, by some "radicals" affinity, with delay time \(\tau_{d}\)

\[N_{d}(t)=k_{d}*I*\tau_{d}*(t-\tau_{d}*(1-exp(-t/\tau_{d})))\]

After end of irradiation at moment \(t_{0}\), these values changes exponentially Figure 4: Relative light yield vs. recovery time for different irradiation doze. x=1.5 cm. Open points - the doze accumulated in two steps.

\(N_{i}(t)=N_{i}(t_{1})*exp(-(t-t_{0})/\tau_{i}))\)\(N_{d}(t)=N_{d}(t_{1})+k_{d}*I*(1-exp(-(t-t_{0})/\tau_{d}))\)

Resulted scintillation light yield at time \(t\) and at the distance \(x\) from point of scintillation to fiber is described by following expression

\[E(t,\,x)=E(0,\,x)*S(t)/S(0)*exp(-x*(\Sigma_{i}N_{i}(t)+N_{d}(t)))\]

To fit experimental data we assumed that there exist scattered centers of two different life times and only one that of "delayed" centers ( six parameters in total). The result of the fit of all experimental data by this expression is shown in Figs.5,6,7,8.

## 4 Predictions for ATLAS Tile calorimeter

Using this model with the parameters taken from the fit of experimental data we can make predictions for the evolution of ATLAS Tile scintillators in long term experiment. We assume that radiation doze for the most irradiated part of calorimeter is 0.04 MRad in 10 years Run at max. luminosity. The change of light yield in time for the middle region of the tile and that near it's edge is shown in Fig.9. We can predict also the variation of scintillator response during shutdowns and that of due to the irradiation by \(Cs^{137}\) source used for TICAL calibration.

## 5 Conclusion

Data analys demonstrated negligable effect of Atlas scintillation tile calorimeter degradation under irradiation at maximum luminosity.

Proposed simplest phenomenological model describes data reasonably well. It can be easely modified to achieve better data description for very low and very high irradiation dozes. It can be used for the analysis of other types of scintillators, for fibers etc. Probably it can give some information for the developing of realistic microscopic description of radiation damage in plastic scintillators [3]. We have to stress here that the irradiation was done with \(Cs^{137}\) source and at rather high irradiation rate. In real conditions the dominant contribution to radiation damage comes from low energy neutrons. More detailed measurements at extremally low and high irradiation dozes are in progress.
