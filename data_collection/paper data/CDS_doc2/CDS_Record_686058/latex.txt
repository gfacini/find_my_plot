The thermal Module

prototype Evaluation

R. Apsimon, M. Gibson, W. Murray, B. Payne

Two ATLAS SCT barrel module thermal prototypes have been constructed at RAL according to the design A1-TB-0059-051-01-A. The four blank silicon wafers were patterned with nichrome heater tracks, and the power dissipation could be individually computer controlled. A module was mounted on a cooling pipe through which water at a controlled temperature was pumped. It was equipped with Pt100 temperature sensors and the temperature distributions measured for a variety of different heating conditions and coolant temperatures.

A finite element model has been built to resemble the module as closely as possible and a comparison of the temperature distributions is presented here.

### Introduction

The thermal performance of ATLAS SCT modules is of great importance. The power dissipated in silicon detectors is given by the bias voltage on the detector multiplied by the current.This current is strongly temperature dependent. If the temperature rises then the current rises, the power rises and the temperature rises further, in what can lead to thermal runaway. From this perspective the temperature should be kept as low as possible.

However, there is an optimal temperature from the point of view of the depletion voltage after irradiation. This is generally agreed to be around -7 'C [1], and this has fixed the ATLAS specification of the module temperature as - 10'C at its coldest point and with \(<\) 5'C \(\partial\)T across the four silicon wafers. Finally, the cooling system is easier to operate the higher its temperature is, and so the temperature difference between the coolant and the coldest point of the silicon should also be minimised.

Thermal simulations of a variety of modules have been made (e.g. [2]). The conclusion of which indicate that very high thermal conductivity Thermal Pyrolytic Graphite (TPG) baseboard material will be required. This electrically conductive material will have an unknown effect on the capacitance between this baseboard and the coolant pipes.

The question of the glue pattern connecting the silicon to the baseboard has not been fully addressed, and is often assumed to be a complete coverage, which is not practicable. This pattern has to be arranged so as not to degrade the thermal performance significantly.

A prototype thermal module was constructed at RAL in accordance with the design 1-TB-0059-051-01-A, Figure 1. This is described in section 2. It has been evaluated and details of this are to be found in section 3. These data have then been compared to FEA simulation of the module in section 4, and section 5 presents our conclusions.

### Module Assembly

The module was constructed using thermally realistic components and adhesives. The four beryllia facings were first glued to the baseboard. The glue patterns were applied using pre-cut masks. Each mask was constructed from three layers of wafer protection film, into which, a series of rectangular openings were cut using a scalpel. These openings defined a realistic glue pattern that would, in an electrically working module, ensure that no glue covered the openings in the p-side passivation layer or the guard ring structures. The two mask patterns used are shown in Fig. 2.

Four small openings were included to simulate the bias contacts that would be made between the detectors and the baseboard. In a final module, these connections would be made with silver loaded epoxy but for simplicity, they were made with the same Araldite mixture as the rest of the module. The final dimensions of the glue pattern in the module are shown in Figure 3.

The four silicon wafers were etch-polished, 300 \(\upmu\)m thick, high resistivity, n-type silicon onto which were deposited nichrome heater tracks [3]. The wafers were glued to the 420 \(\upmu\)m thick (380\(\upmu\)m plus two layers of 20\(\upmu\)m), polyimide coated TPG baseboard using Araldite 2011 and a Boron Nitride filler [4]. A simple jig, using dowel pins to position the components, was employed to align the wafers to the baseboard. Each beryllia hybrid was equipped with 4 thick film resistor packages, each with a nominal resistance of 22\(\Omega\), which were wired in series to a suitable power supply. Connection was made to the nichrome tracks on the detector wafers with silver loaded epoxy. Figure 4 shows a cross-section through the completed module with measured (m), theoretical (t) and calculated (c) dimensions indi

cated. The module was then photographed, before and after the addition of the Pt100 temperature sensors. These photographs are shown in Figure 5 and 6.

The finished module was equipped with 14 small area Pt100 platinum resistance thermometers, connected to a terminal strip mounted off the module. The position of these sensors is shown in Figure 7.

An additional Pt100 (#15) was used to record the ambient air temperature. It was situated approximately 50 mm horizontally from the module, in the same air stream. Two wire read-out was employed since the temperature effects on the cables and connectors would be small. Each pair of wires could be shorted together close to the sensor element. In this way, the short circuit loop resistance for each sensor could be measured before testing the module. Each pair of wires was attached to the terminals of a voltage sensing card in a Keithley 7001 80 channel scanner. A LabVIEW programme controlled the switching of these signals to a Keithley 199 DMM which read the loop resistance of each sensor circuit. These resistances were converted to temperatures, after subtraction of the short circuit loop resistance. The measured temperatures, times and operating conditions were stored to disk for later analysis.

### Static tests in air

Inside ATLAS, each module will be thermally coupled to a flat cooling pipe of 9 mm width. To simulate this arrangement, a copper plate was machined to provide an identical cooling contact. The module was attached by two M1.6 screws. A layer of Dow Corning 340 thermal grease was interposed between the module and the plate to provide a realistic thermal contact. The module was cooled by a supply of temperature controlled water flowing through the pipe.

The beryllia hybrids' resistors, used to simulate the 6 chip sets on the final hybrids, were powered from a standard laboratory bench supply. The detector power was provided by computer controlled supplies connected by GPIB-bus to the local Macintosh computer. The module and cooling pipe assembly were placed inside an insulated, temperature-controlled enclosure.

Table 1: Results from static thermal tests in airData taking runs were first completed for two different hybrid power loads (4W and 4.6W) and ten different silicon detector powers (0 to 4.5 Watts total, in steps of 0.5 Watts). The ambient air temperature remained at about 21\({}^{\circ}\)C for all runs. In general, the coolant was held at about 19\({}^{\circ}\)C, however two runs were made at fixed module power but with the water 5\({}^{\circ}\)C warmer and 5\({}^{\circ}\)C cooler than normal. Finally, runs were made with single detectors powered and with vertical and horizontal pairs of wafers powered. A summary of the conditions and results of each run is given in Table 1. The column of results labelled "Si \(\partial\)T (Inc. centre of hybrid)" is included to provide a worst case indication of what the highest silicon temperature might be on the module. With a gap of only about 175 \(\upmu\)m between the hybrid and the silicon it is probable that the silicon will approach the hybrid temperature. In almost every test, the Si \(\partial\)T is within about 6\({}^{\circ}\)C. The column labelled "Si \(\partial\)T wrt contact point" shows the temperature difference between the hottest part of the silicon wafers and the coldest part of the module. The final column gives the differential temperature between the highest temperature on the module and that on the coolant pipe. Although these results are, in some cases, just outside the ATLAS specification this suggests that the design is close to optimization. If one ignores the temperature at the centre of the hybrid and just considers the measured silicon temperatures, the module clearly remains inside the specification for all running conditions. It should be remembered that a real power limit will exist since the front-end electronics will only be able to operate with a standing current of the order of 1-2 \(\upmu\)A per channel. At 300V operation, this would imply less than 1W total power dissipation in the silicon.

### Thermal Runaway tests in air

A real module inside the ATLAS Inner Detector will dissipate power not only from the front-end electronics and the intrinsic detector leakage currents but also from the damaging effects of radiation. As indicated in section 1, this can result in thermal runaway. The most straightforward way to simulate this effect is by building a module using pre-irradiated detectors. In the absence of these, it was decided to use a software control programme, running within the LabVIEW structure, to vary the power dissipated inside the heaters on the silicon wafers according to a theoretical model of the thermal runaway process.

The module was powered with a starting set of conditions. The hybrid power was left fixed at 4.6W and the silicon power was increased in such a way that the total power dissipated within the four wafers doubled for every 7\({}^{\circ}\)C rise in temperature. In practice, the temperature increase was either measured from the coldest part of the module to the hottest temperature recorded on the silicon or from the coldest point to the average silicon temperature. Whilst the first method would inevitably lead to an over-estimate of the real impact of radiation damage, it was felt that this would indicate the safe working range of the module design.

Table 1: Results from static thermal tests in air The results of a typical run are shown in Figure 8. In this case the initial silicon power was set to1.5W and the incremental changes were computed from the temperature difference between the hottest part of the silicon and the coldest part of the module. Figure 9 shows a comparison between the two methods discussed above. Although the shape of the two curves indicating the value of the highest silicon temperature are clearly different, the end result is the same. With this module, no sign of thermal runaway is seen with a starting power of 1.35W. In practice, the module clearly approached thermal runaway if it was started at 1.8W and at 1.5W the evidence was maginal.

Measurements were repeated under vacuum, so that the contribution of conduction and convection to the module cooling could be eliminated. As before, the coolant temperature was close to that of the ambient atmosphere, except for some special runs. The details of the runs are given in Table 2.

### Vacuum tests

The module was mounted inside a glass bell-jar which could be evacuated by an oil-free diaphragm pump. The ultimate pressure was measured to be \(<\) 18 tor (= 24 mbar). The same temperature sensors and read-out system were used to acquire the data shown. As an additional check, the last seven vacuum runs were repeated under air at atmospheric pressure. Figure 10 shows a comparison of three runs taken with a total hybrid power of 4.6 Watts and a detector power of 2 Watts. Two of these runs were carried out at 1 atmosphere and one under vacuum. The analysis of the data taken indicated that the measured temperature differences between the cooling pipe and the module were significantly different between the static tests in air and those taken in vacuum and in air using the bell jar. In both cases the same module, cooling support, thermal grease and fixtures were used. Despite this, a significant thermal variance remained. To understand this more fully, plots were made of the temperature difference between the cooling pipe and the coldest point on the module, as a function of module power. In both cases a linear relationship was seen. For the first series of runs the thermal resistance was measured as 0.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C/W whilst for the second series it was nearly 1.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C/W. These plots are shown in Figure 11. It is interesting to note that the scatter of points about a straight line fit is independent of whether the power is generated in the hybrid, the detectors or both. This tells us that the design is making full use of the cooling contact. It might also imply that the earlier FEA analysis carried out by Kondo [5] is accurate in advocating the use of the beryllia facings to augment the lateral heat transfer, as well as the mechanical rigidity of the module. After the measurements were made, an attempt was made to replicate the thermal resistance of around 0.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C/W again by further tightening the two screws that secure the module to the cooled plate. This resulted in a minimal improvement to around 1.4 \({}^{\circ}\)C/W. Finally, the module was removed from its mounting and replaced using a new layer of thermal paste. In this case, the measured thermal resistance had fallen to around 0.8 \({}^{\circ}\)C/W. Details of these last two tests are also shown on the graph in Figure 11. It is clear that a potential problem exists with the mounting of modules on cooling pipes. As a follow-up to this work, it is proposed that a series of controlled tests are undertaken to understand the relevant importance of the thermal interface thickness, the fixing procedure and the tightening torque of the mounting screws. This result serves to highlight the need for thermal measurements on modules as they are fixed to the brackets in the final assembly.

### Thermal Runaway tests in vacuum

These tests were carried out to understand whether the effects of conductive and convective heat loss to the surrounding atmosphere had effected the runaway tests carried out in air. Although the final modules will operate in an atmosphere of nitrogen it has been an accepted design criterion that the power generated within the module should be evacuated through the coolant, rather than by the surrounding gas.

The module was again powered using a computer controlled supply. Five runs were carried out with starting powers ranging from 0.8W to 1.8W. Although the module exhibited a similar critical power (the detector power level at which runaway become inevitable) of about 4W, the starting power at which this was achieved had reduced to about 1.35W. Analysis of these results concluded that the module behaviour was essentially unchanged by operation in vacuum. It was therefore concluded that the present design provides an adequate thermal path between the module and coolant.

### Finite Element Analysis

Finite element analysis has been performed using a program written at RAL for the purpose. Because it was designed with this application in mind, certain things are very easy to do: for example the thickness of any material layer can be very easily altered, only one number needs to be changed. However, it is not a professional package, and to some extent the results of these tests can be seen as a test of the coding of this program.

### Outline of FEA program

The FEA code is written in C++, using an object-oriented approach. Classes such as points, lines, planes, 2D and 3D polygons are the basis, and elements are derived from the 3D polygons, with the addition of material information. Contacts are found between all elements, a process which also checks whether they overlap, and is quite slow. Elements are then subdivided if the contacts windows align badly with the volume element centre, or if the element is simply too big. Next the temperature distribution is found approximately, and any elements which have large temperature differences between them and their neighbours are split further.

As in any FEA program, there are approximations. One comes from the finite size of the elements, another from the fact that only heat flows perpendicular to the contact are correctly modelled. Any deviation from this line must introduce errors. This is because it is not known whether the heat will transfer back to the same line at a later stage or not. This restricts the change in size from one element to the next. In this case, if the maximum error is more than a factor of two the element is subdivided.

The approach used, then, is to specify each physical item by as few elements as possible, and then let the code break them up as necessary. For the thermal module some 350 elements are directly specified, and these are subdivided to about 4000 for simulation.

Once all these elements exist, the geometrical side of the problem can be completely forgotten, and it becomes a question of finding the temperatures for all the elements. This is done by solving for each element, assuming the temperatures of its neighbours are fixed, to find the temperature at which it is stable. This is iterated, perhaps 100,000 times until the temperature of all elements converges. To speed up the procedure, it is stopped occasionally, and a guess at the final temperature is made, by extrapolating the temperature history using an exponential.

### Materials used, dimensions and design

The colour of a material refers to its appearance in the module picture; this is the PAW colour scheme, which is converted to shades of grey in black and white.

The radiation length is used to calculate the total radiation length of the module, for comparison with other calculations to check the design is implemented correctly.

The silicon wafers are each 64mm by 63.6mm, and the baseboard and glue pattern are as indicated in figure 3. The cooling contact is 8mm by 62mm, and the hybrid 28mm by 74.6mm.

The intention was to model the thermal module as constructed, rather than an ATLAS ideal. Two cut-away views can be seen in figure 12.

\end{table}
Table 3:The dimensions all match those used, except that the design has been squared-off, so that all angles are right-angles, while preserving areas, and the heat is supplied by 'chips' mounted just on top of the real heaters. All glue joints are 100um, and follow the glue pattern indicated in Figure 3.

The most serious omission in the FEA, is that the entire module is placed in vacuum, and no radiation is simulated.

### Comparison with data

This comparison has been made for several of the static thermal tests, but results are only shown here for the conditions of 4.6W on the chips and 2W on the detectors.Of course the FEA is ideally suited to producing dynamic runs too.

Firstly, it should be noticed that the corrections due to the air are large. It can be seen in table 1 that when all power is off, changing the coolant temperature by 8.75 degrees, from 15.25 to 24, changes the silicon temperature with respect to the cooling by 2.8 degrees, and in fact the sensor number 1 always reads half way between the coolant temperature and the air temperature in the absence of power.

We can see for this corner that the thermal resistance to the environment is equal to that to the coolant. Using this, and the relative temperatures of coolant and environment in any run it is possible to correct the measured temperatures to what would have been observed if this contact did not exist. These corrections are generally small, because the system was operated such that the silicon temperature was approximately atmospheric.

Figure 12:

The comparison between the measured and simulated temperature differences appears below:

Fig 12

\(\bullet\)The measured temperatures of the hybrid are several degrees less than simulated. This is probably because conduction through the air gap has not been modelled.

\(\bullet\)The silicon temperatures, after correction, agree rather well between data and simulation

\(\bullet\)The BeO facing temperature is nearly 1 degree higher than predicted. This is not too surprising as in the simulation the lower facing plate is directly connected to the cool surface, while in the thermal module there is a grease joint and copper block before the coolant.

With these caveats the results are in reasonable agreement.

### Conclusions

These tests have shown that the simple assembly techniques used for the construction of thermal modules work well. The adhesive bonding of dummy detectors to polyimide coated TPG have performed as expected and have given rise to thermal management that is well understood by Finite Element Analysis techniques. We have also learnt of the importance of the convective thermal transfer. Whether this extra thermal transfer is beneficial or not depends upon the temperature achieved by the nitrogen in the enclosed SCT volume, but it is likely to inhibit thermal runaway.

The structural integrity of the modules has been well demonstrated as some of the power levels encountered in thermal runaway tests are far beyond those envisaged in the final experiment. The thermal performance of the Boron Nitride loaded epoxy is also well simulated and appears adequate for the final design.

The Macintosh-based, GPIB read-out system has allowed the rapid acquisition, display and storage of data. The combination of small area PT100 temperature sensors and 2-wire read-out has reduced the levels of additional cabling without significant degradation of the measurement accuracy.
