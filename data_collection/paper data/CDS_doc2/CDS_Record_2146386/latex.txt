**Abstract**

In the context of precision measurements of the properties of the Higgs boson, one of the most fundamental parameters is the knowledge of its mass. One of the achievements of the first run of the LHC is the precise estimate of the Higgs Boson mass, that has been measured by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at a precision of 0.2% using and final states. In the analysis of the experimental data, interference effects of non-resonant \(gg\to\gamma\gamma\) and other processes with resonant \(gg\to H\to\gamma\gamma\) production are not taken into account. The real part of the interference terms change the line-shape of \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) in such a way that an apparent mass shift appears. In this note a study is carried out that quantifies the expected shift of the mass peak position for the SM Higgs boson in the channel for the ATLAS measurement. The purpose is to perform this analysis using the correct detector description and event categorization used for this measurement. The expected median mass shift is found to be \(\Delta m_{H}=-35\pm 9\) MeV assuming a Standard Model width of 4 MeV for the Higgs boson, which is negligibly small with respect to the current experimental error. In addition the mass shift for non Standard Model widths is discussed.

## 1 Introduction

In the Standard Model of particle physics (SM), there exist two processes that have two gluons in the initial state and and two photons in the final state, respectively : \(gg\to H\to\gamma\gamma\) Higgs boson production and non-resonant \(gg\to\gamma\gamma\) production which is mainly mediated by a box diagram of light quarks. As both processes have the same initial and final states an interference between both takes place, as depicted in Fig. 1. The impact of this interference is two-fold:

1. An imaginary component reduces the total signal yield by about 2%. This effect has been taken into account in the existing \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analyses by modifying the gluon-gluon initiated cross sections accordingly [1, 2].
2. A real component that engenders the shift of the Higgs boson mass. This component is odd around the Higgs boson mass and does not change the yield however, when folded with the experimental resolution of the invariant di-photon mass it engenders an apparent negative shift in the observed Higgs boson mass. So far this effect is not taken into account in any of the measurements carried out in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channels as it has not been studied by experimental collaborations.

The impact of the first effect was studied at leading-order (LO) in [3] and the impact of the second at LO and next-to-leading-order (NLO) in QCD by Refs. [4, 5], using approximations for the detector resolution of the diphoton invariant mass. At NLO the gluon-fusion production of Higgs bosons may occur through quark-gluon initiated processes, meaning that it can also interfere with the tree level \(qg\to q\gamma\gamma\) process. The purpose of this note is to carry out an analysis using the correct detector description and event categorization used in the ATLAS measurement of Ref. [1]. This allows to take into account the variation of the resolution and of the background shape and yield across categories, which is needed to properly estimate the impact of this effect. For the interference contribution the Sherpa 2.0 implementation of Ref. [3] is used and the expected mass shift assuming a Higgs boson mass of \(m_{H}=125\) GeV and a Higgs width of \(\Gamma_{H}=4\) MeV is reported. The rest of this note is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly summarizes the methodology of the mass measurement. For more details of the reconstruction, selection and the statistical aspects of the mass measurement the reader is referred to Ref. [1]. Section 3 summarizes the Monte-Carlo samples used in this study. In Section 4 the expected mass shift is presented and Section 5 summarizes the impact of missing higher-order corrections and other systematic uncertainties on the result. Section 6 presents the details of the results and the impact of higher-order corrections separately in each category. Section 7 presents the impact of non-SM width assumptions and Section 8 provides a summary of the findings.

## 2 Overview of the mass measurement in the di-photon channel

The Higgs boson mass measurement carried out by ATLAS and published in Ref. [1] combines the information of the two channels with the best mass resolution, \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to\,4\ell\). For the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) selection, candidate events are retained using a diphoton trigger, which selected events containing two electromagnetic clusters with transverse energies greater than 35 GeV and 25 GeV and shower shapes matching the expectation for electromagnetic showers initiated by photons. Photon candidates are reconstructed from clusters of energy deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter. Both unconverted and converted photon candidates are used in the analysis and the invariant mass of the diphoton pair is required to lie in the range of \(105\leq m_{\gamma\gamma}<160\) GeV. The photons are required to have a transverseFigure 1: Feynman diagrams representing the interference term between the \(gg\to H\to\gamma\gamma\) and either the \(gg\to\gamma\gamma\) or \(qg\to q\gamma\gamma\) processes

momentum satisfying \(p_{T}/m_{\gamma\gamma}>0.35\) (0.25) for the leading (subleading) photon and a pseudo-rapidity1 passing \(|\eta|<2.37\), but excluding the transition regions between the barrel and end-cap calorimeters, \(1.37<|\eta|<1.56\). These photons are also required to satisfy 'tight' selection criteria [6]. Events are simultaneously analysed in ten categories that separate diphoton candidates based on their expected diphoton mass resolution and the signal purity: Table 1 summarises the categorisation criteria.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

Depending on the category, the signal-to-background ratio under the peak varies between 2% and 24.6% and the resolution between 1.21 GeV and 2.41 GeV [1]. Despite having the best signal-to-background ratio and resolution, the high-\(p_{T_{t}}\) categories do not add much statistical power to the mass measurement as the expected number of events in these categories is small for the dataset recorded at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV. As most of the signal events fall in the low-\(p_{T_{t}}\) categories, these categories are bringing most of the statistical power for this measurement.

In each category the signal mass spectrum is modelled as the sum of a Crystal-Ball to describe the core resolution and a wide Gaussian contribution to model far outliers in the mass resolution. The background is obtained directly from a fit to the diphoton mass distribution and described as an exponential of a polynomial of first or second order, depending on the category. The Higgs boson mass is determined using a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit of all categories with the production yields normalized to the SM expectation and the background shape parameters floated. The largest systematic uncertainties on the determined Higgs boson mass in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel are from the photon energy calibration and their effect is included by a set of nuisance parameters into the likelihood with Gaussian constraints. The reported Higgs boson mass in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel is \(m_{H}=125.98\pm 0.42\,(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 0.28\,(\mathrm{syst.})\) GeV. This result was statistically combined with the Higgs boson mass measurement of the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) from ATLAS and equivalent measurements carried out by the CMS collaboration to obtain \(m_{H}=125.09\pm 0.21\,(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 0.11\,(\mathrm{syst.})\) GeV [7, 8, 9, 10].

## 3 Monte-Carlo samples

Gluon fusion signal and interference events are produced using Sherpa 2.0[11, 12]. The interference contributions take into account the interference between gluon fusion signal and non-resonant \(gg\to\gamma\gamma\) box and \(qg\to q\,\gamma\gamma\) processes at NLO precision in QCD, and are matched to a parton-shower (PS) [13] to account for further higher-order effects. The PS parameter CSS_IS_AS_FAC, responsible for the ordering of the showering evolution in Sherpa 2.0, has been tuned in such a way that for gluon fusion signal the Higgs boson's \(p_{T}\) distribution of HRes 2.0[14, 15] is approximately reproduced. The agreement between the differential cross-section with respect to \(p_{T}\) predicted by Sherpa 2.0 after tuning and the one predicted by HRes 2.0 is at the 20% level with a value of CSS_IS_AS_FAC = 1.5. It is assumed that this tuning also improves the interference and background description, which was validated by comparing the backgroung \(p_{T}\) spectrum to ResBos [16]. The gluon fusion signal and interference templates are scaled by \(K\)-factors to account for missing higher-order contributions : for gluon fusion the used factor is \(K_{s}=1.45\) to match the next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO+NNLL) QCD calculation with NLO electroweak corrections applied Ref. [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26] of \(\sigma_{gg\to H}=19.27\pm 2\) pb. For the interference this enters as a scaling of the size of \(\sqrt{K_{s}\,K_{b}}\) where \(K_{b}\) is a factor accounting for missing higher-order corrections in the background. For the background modelling this factor is not relevant, as a data-driven method is used to determine its shape and normalization. In what follows the interference contribution is corrected using an estimate of \(K_{b}=K_{s}\) and the associated uncertainties. The large sample size of the simulated gluon fusion signal and interference contributions needed to achieve the necessary statistical precision for the used templates prevents the use of the full ATLAS detector simulation and a smeared detector modelization is used to account for the photon resolution as well as the photon reconstruction, identification and mistag efficiencies. This simulation is based on the statistical model used in Ref. [1]. Vector-boson fusion (VBF) and associated Higgs production with a vector boson or a \(t\bar{t}\)-pair are added by re-scaling the gluon-fusion signal to take into account these additional contributions. These scaling factors have been determined using the inputs from Ref. [1] that used the full ATLAS detector simulation, and are estimated and applied separately in each category. As the contribution coming from interference between the associated production signal and their respective background is expected to be negligible [27], the interference templates are not modified. Normalizations for VBF and associated production with a vector-boson are corrected to match cross sections calculated at NNLO in QCD with NLO electroweak corrections from Ref. [17, 28, 29, 30]. The normalization for Higgs production in association with a \(t\bar{t}\)-pair is corrected to match the cross section calculated at NLO in QCD with NLO electroweak corrections from Ref. [17, 31, 32, 33, 34]. All samples use a Higgs boson mass of \(m_{H}=125\) GeV and a SM Higgs boson width of 4 MeV, unless stated otherwise.

## 4 Expected median mass shift assuming the Standard Model Higgs boson

The expected median mass shift is estimated by constructing a sample of simulated signal events, usually referred to as an 'Asimov' data set [35]: the simulated Sherpa events are used to build templates for the signal ('S') and interference ('I') components for all 10 categories. These are scaled to the observed integrated luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=20.3\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and merged with the background shape ('B') obtained from a background-only fit using the background functions reported in Ref. [1]. An example for a signal and interference template is shown in Fig. 2. The resulting templates are then fitted using a binned likelihood fit with the same probability density function parametrizations for the signal and background components as Ref. [1]. The size of each invariant mass bin is of 10 MeV, and it has been checked that reasonnablevariations of the bin size was not impacting the result. To validate the procedure a second Asimov data set was generated including only the signal + background components: the resulting coupling strength values (\(\mu\)) and Higgs boson mass values agree within 0.5% and 0.002%, respectively, with the expected generated values. The observed non-closure, which is smaller than the shift itself and the other uncertainties, is likely due to the approximate smearing method that is used and will be considered as an uncertainty. The expected mass shift is obtained from the difference of the fitted Higgs boson mass of the fits excluding and including the interference contribution assuming a SM coupling strength of unity and \(m_{H}=125\) GeV. To estimate the statistical uncertainty four statistical independent signal and interference samples of events were produced and a sample variance of 0.3 MeV was found. Table 2 summarizes the mass shift obtained on each of the individual sample, and the estimated median mass shift is found to be:

\[\Delta m_{H}=m_{H}^{S+I+B}-m_{H}^{S+B}=-35\pm 0.3\ \text{(stat.)}\ \text{MeV} \tag{1}\]

## 5 Systematic uncertainties considered

The size of the expected mass shift depends on the choice of the \(K\)-factors for signal and background, as well as on missing higher-order corrections from QCD in the interference templates.

Figure 2: Mass distribution generated by the signal and interference terms as well as of the combination of both in category 5 (as defined in Table 1). For illustrative purpose the interference term has been scaled by a factor 10.

\(K\)-factor variationsThe \(K\)-factor for signal are varied within the recommended errors of [17] to account for the impact of the uncertainties on parton distribution function and on the value of \(\alpha_{S}\) on the total cross-section. This results in a change of \(K_{S}=1.45\pm 0.1\). For the background \(K\)-factor the value of \(K_{B}=K_{S}\) was chosen for the central value. As higher-order cross sections allow for additional diagrams with more QCD radiation, we expect the total cross-section to grow when increasing the order in the perturbative calculation, i.e. \(K_{B}>1\). In addition, one naively expects \(K_{B}<K_{S}\) due to the additional suppression of heavy quark effects in the leading background box diagram [36]. Thus for \(K_{B}\) a variation of \([1,K_{S}]\) is taken as an uncertainty estimate. The total uncertainty due to choice of \(K\)-factors is taken as the full envelope of all variations and Table 3 summarizes the change in the mass shift \(\Delta m_{H}\).

All the variations and their impacts on \(\Delta m_{H}\) are given in Table 3. The variations of the results with respect to \(K_{S}\) are smaller than for \(K_{B}\). Indeed varying \(K_{S}\) has an impact on both the signal and interference templates, which means that the impact of these variations partially cancels in \(\Delta m_{H}\), making the mass shift fairly insensitive to the value of \(K_{S}\). Conversely, varying \(K_{B}\) only modifies the cross-section of the interference term and directly translates to a bigger variation of the mass-shift as there are no possible cancellations. Taking the largest variation translates into an uncertainty of \(\pm 7\) MeV.

Additional missing higher order corrections from QCDThe impact of missing higher order corrections from QCD on the NLO signal and interference templates is assessed by independent variations of the renormalization, factorization and resummation scales. For the expected mass shift, all scales are set to \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\), and the renormalization and factorization scales are varied within \(m_{\gamma\gamma}/2\) and 2 \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\). The resummation scale, which impacts the behaviour of the parton shower, is changed within \(m_{\gamma\gamma}/4\) and 2 \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\). The resulting uncertainties for the variations are summarized in Table 4. The total scale uncertainty is determined by the envelope of the individual variations.

Other uncertaintiesA non-closure of 3 MeV is observed, when comparing the fitted Higgs boson mass obtained with the signal plus background fit to the ten categories and the input Higgs boson mass used to generate the Monte-Carlo samples.

The impact of the choice of background function in the fit has also been assessed by replacing the background shape by a second-order polynomial in all categories at once. This results in a variation of 3 MeV on the mass-shift.

## 6 Mass shift by categories

The size of the interference induced mass shift depends not only on the overall size of the interference contribution, which is linked to the kinematic of the selected diphoton pair as it impacts the signal-to-background ratio, but also on the overall diphoton mass resolution. Consequently, the expected median mass shift is different for each category (defined in Table 1) : the first line of Table 5 summarizes the category-by-category expected median mass shift. Categories 5 and 10 exhibit the poorest mass resolution and have the largest mass shift of all ten categories of -59 and -62 MeV, respectively. The high-\(p_{T_{t}}\) categories 2, 4, 7 and 9 exhibit fair resolution and most of the interference contributions is in the low \(p_{T}\) region, what results in a much lower mass shift ranging from -2 to -13 MeV. The low-\(p_{T_{t}}\) categories retain most of the Higgs boson signal events and interference contributions; this leads to expected median mass shifts ranging from -41 to -56 MeV. As the full combined ten-category fit obtains most of its statistical power from the signal events observed in the low-\(p_{T_{t}}\) categories, the combined median expected mass shift is dominated by the smaller mass shifts observed in these categories.

The overall size of the category-by-category median mass shift depends strongly on the resummation scale: its value controls the \(p_{T}\) cut-off scale of additional parton emissions from the parton-shower algorithm and emissions with a \(p_{T}\) above this scale originate from fixed-order matrix elements. The transition between these two emission regimes is very abrupt [37] and thus the fraction of interference events in the high-\(p_{T_{t}}\) categories is very dependent of the exact choice of the resummation scale. Another important effect that suppresses the mass shift in the high-\(p_{T_{t}}\) categories are sizeable contributions from \(qg\) interference diagrams, cf. Fig. 1 : their contributions is even around the Higgs boson mass in contrast to the \(gg\) interference contributions, reducing the overall impact on the line shape [5]. The presence of \(qg\) interference contributions can even result in a change of the mass shift from negative to positive values, if one changes the resummation scale. Albeit the systematic uncertainties on the mass shift in the high-\(p_{T_{t}}\) categories is sizable, the total mass shift of the ten-category fit is only weakly affected by changes there due to the lack of statistical power of these categories to affect the combined extracted Higgs boson mass.

## 7 Result for a larger Higgs boson width

An interesting method introduced by Refs. [4, 5] allows one to extract an indirect limit on the total Higgs boson width using the dependence of the apparent mass-shift on the width. A larger Higgs boson width would result in a lower \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) branching fraction, which would be plausible if yet-unobserved or invisible decay channels are present or the Higgs boson's coupling differ from the SM expectation. Such scenarios are discussed in Ref. [38] and, assuming SM couplings of the Higgs boson, the measured coupling strength values in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel strongly constrain the total Higgs boson width. The measured coupling strength could be accommodated by allowing a variation of the effective coupling to gluons (\(c_{g}\)) and photons (\(c_{\gamma}\)), such that the total signal and interference cross-section is modified to :

\[(c_{g}c_{\gamma})^{2}\sigma_{S}(\Gamma)+(c_{g}c_{\gamma})\sigma_{I}(\Gamma)= \sigma_{S}(\Gamma_{SM})+\sigma_{I}(\Gamma_{SM}), \tag{3}\]

where \(\sigma_{S/I}(\Gamma)\) denotes the \(gg\to H\) signal or interference cross section at a Higgs boson width \(\Gamma\) and \(\Gamma_{\rm SM}=4\) MeV.

The induced expected mass-shift for Higgs Boson widths of \(\Gamma=300\) MeV and \(600\) MeV is \(\Delta m_{H}=-313\pm 72\) (total) MeV and \(-453\pm 106\) (total) MeV, respectively, for \(m_{H}=125\) GeV, where the errors are determined in the same way than discussed in Section 5. The resulting shifts evolve linearly with the square-root of the width, as pointed out by Ref. [5].

## 8 Conclusion

In this note the expected shift of the Higgs boson mass in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel due to interference effects between gluon fusion Higgs boson production and its irredublible backgrounds was investigated for a SM Higgs boson, using the correct detector description and event categorization developed for the ATLAS measurement. The necessary predictions were obtained using Sherpa 2.0, that implemented the analytical NLO and LO QCD interference calculation for \(gg\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(qg\to q\,\gamma\gamma\) processes of Ref. [5]. The expected median mass-shift was found to be \(\Delta m_{H}=-35\pm 0.3\) (stat.) \(\pm\) 8 (theo.) \(\pm\) 4 (syst.) MeV assuming \(m_{H}=125\) GeV and a width of the Higgs boson of 4 MeV. The largest uncertainty on the expected mass shift originates from unknown higher-order corrections in QCD and the mass-shift is not sizeable with respect to the total uncertainties of Ref. [1], and is well contained within the current total error if the SM Higgs boson width is assumed. With the large expected datasets of Run 2, measurements of the Higgs boson mass will become systematically limited. In light of this, incorporating the impact of interference effects and their associated uncertainties into the measurements of the Higgs boson mass using the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel will become important.

## Appendix A Results for the inclusive case

This appendix aims at drawing a comparison between the results obtained in this note and the ones that were published in Ref. [5], where an expected median mass-shift of \(\Delta m_{H}=-70\) MeV was reported. There are two main differences, the first being that Ref. [5] did not include the associated production mechanisms and assessed the magnitude of this shift in the pure gluon-fusion channel, and the second being that it did not use an event categorization. In order to produce the equivalent Asimov datasets for this problem, the ten datasets representing each categories have been merged together to form a summed inclusive sample. The background has been determined from a fit to data of an exponential of a second order polynomial. This inclusive Asimov dataset has been fitted using a second order polynomial for the background and an inclusive signal model, which slightly differs from the sum of the signal in the ten categories. Two variations of this Asimov dataset have been generated : either including the associated production component into the fit or not. In the first case an expected mass-shift of \(\Delta m_{H}=-49\) MeV has been determined, whose difference with the main result of this note mainly comes from the difference of resolution between the datasets. Removing the associated production components yields to an estimated mass-shift of \(\Delta m_{H}=-54\) MeV. The resolution of the inclusive dataset from ATLAS is dominated by a Crystal-Ball function with a core resolution of \(\sigma=1.5\) GeV while [5] used an approximate Gaussian resolution function with \(\sigma=1.7\) GeV. This difference of resolution function is known to have a sizeable impact on the estimated mass-shift.
