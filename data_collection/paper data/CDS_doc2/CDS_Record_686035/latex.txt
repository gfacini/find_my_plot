**Abstract**

The design of the First Prototype Pixel Sensors for ATLAS has been completed. The wafers will include two large rectangular structures, each of which accepts 16 readout chips and is compatible with the prototype barrel module design. The two structures, designated Tile 1 and Tile 2, permit examination of a variety of design options and are described here.

## 1 Overview of the ATLAS Pixel Sensor Program

The ATLAS Experiment at the CERN LHC will include a silicon pixel detector as its innermost tracking chamber. The detector will consist of three layers of rectangular sensors arranged in a cylindrical ("barrel") pattern coaxial with the beamline, and 8 layers of wedge-shaped sensors assembled into disks. The detector will require 1586 barrel sensors and 1000 disk sensors.

Details of the Design

### As-cut dimensions

The wafers containing the Tiles are provided by their manufacturer without dicing in order that they may be bumped first. After dicing, the dimensions of the Tiles are:

Tile 1 (default): \(18.6\times 62.6\) mm\({}^{2}\), and

Tile 2 (default): \(24.4\times 62.6\) mm\({}^{2}\).

It may be necessary to increase the distance between the guard ring and scribeline in order to guarantee sufficient radiation hardness. To provide for this possibility, a second scribeline is included which would give the Tiles the following dimensions:

Tile 1 (enlarged): \(19.4\times 63.4\) mm\({}^{2}\), and

Tile 2 (enlarged): \(24.4\times 63.4\) mm\({}^{2}\).

### Active area

The active area of each Tile is drawn as 16 units. A "unit" is defined such that pixels in each unit use a common amplifier chip. The symmetry lines in Figures 2 and 4 show the arrangement of these units. The active area of each Tile (excluding guard ring) has dimensions \(16.4\times 60.4\) mm\({}^{2}\). The symmetry lines themselves do not represent physical structures and are for illustrative purposes only.

### Cell geometry

On the accompanying figures, rows are labelled in the horizontal direction, columns in the vertical. The geometry of each cell is characterized as follows:

* Number of pixel cells per unit: \(164\times 18\)* Total number of pixel cells: 47232 (= 16 \(\times\) 1 64 \(\times\) 18 )
* Pixel cell dimensions: \(50\times 400\mu\)m\({}^{2}\)
* Cells that lie in adjacent columns but are read out by different chips are of dimension \(50\times 600\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) (see Figure 2, Detail B, and Figure 4, Detail B).

### \(n\)-side guard ring

The Tiles use similar designs in the \(n\)-side guard ring area. There is an inner guard ring which consists in a metallized \(n^{\pm}\) implant. On Tile 1 the implant has width 86.5\(\mu\)m; on Tile 2 the width is 90\(\mu\)m. On Tile 2 this inner ring can be used for biassing the whole array. Beyond the inner ring is an outer region covered with \(n^{\pm}\) implant. The inner ring and outer region are separated by a gap. On Tile 1, that gap has total width 30\(\mu\)m and is unimplanted. To provide electrical isolation, a 10\(\mu\)m wide p-stop is placed in the center of the gap. On Tile 2, the gap is 8\(\mu\)m wide, and electrical isolation is provided by the p-spray implant which covers the whole device.

Contact pads to the \(n\)-type implant appear in the four corners of the Tile. One each Tile, one of these contact pads bears a label so that the orientation of the Tile is uniquely specified.

### \(p\)-side guard ring

Both Tiles use the same design[3] for their \(p\)-side guard ring. This design appears in Figure 6 and in its Detail 6A. The multi-guardring structure contains 22 rings with a pitch that varies from 20\(\mu\)m near the sensitive area to 50\(\mu\)m near the edge. The \(p\)-implant is 10\(\mu\)m wide in every ring while the gap increases from the center to the edge. The metal overlaps the implant by half of the gap width on the side of the ring facing the sensitive area. The entire guard ring structure is 520\(\mu\)m wide.

### Implant dimensions

In Tile 1, the _n_-type implants are isolated from one another by p-stops of the individual, or "atoll," design. Pairs of units are additionally surrounded by a common p-stop frame. The dimensions of Tile 1 implants are as follows:

* _n\({}^{+}\)_ implant width: 23\(\mu\)m
* _p\({}^{+}\)_ implant width: 5\(\mu\)m
* gap between _n_-type and _p_-type implants: 6\(\mu\)m
* gap between neighboring _p\({}^{+}\)_ implants: 5\(\mu\)m

Complete dimensions of the structures on Tile 2 are shown in Figure 4, Details A and B. For each pixel cell, the mask width of the central _n_-implant is 13\(\mu\)m, while the _n_-implant that surrounds it is 6\(\mu\)m wide. The spacing between those structures is 6\(\mu\)m. In both Tiles, corners are rounded to reduce electric fields. (See for example Figure 2, Detail D.)

### Metallization

The first metal on Tile 1 has the following shape:

* Metal width on pixels: 14\(\mu\)m
* Metal width on the inner guard ring: 6\(\mu\)m narrower than the implant.

The masks for the metallization over the implant of Tile 2 show a width of 12\(\mu\)m, 1\(\mu\)m less than the mask width of the implant.

### Pads

The bond pads are twenty-sided polygons (approximating circles). On Tile 1 the implant has mask diameter 21\(\mu\)m, or processed diameter approximately 23\(\mu\)m. On Tile 2 the implant has mask diameter 18\(\mu\)m. On both Tiles thefirst and second metals have diameter 20\(\mu\)m. The passivation opening has diameter 12\(\mu\)m.

Bond pads are placed at the end of each pixel cell. This layout anticipates a mirrored electronics layout. The closely spaced bond pads are 50\(\mu\)m apart. (See Figure 2, Details A and B). A cross section of a bond pad region is included in Figure 3.

Some pixels have no bond pads. Those cells will have no preamplifier directly above them and so must have their signals routed to bond pads on pixels a few rows away in the same column. For both Tiles, the routing will use a single metal layer. Figure 2 Details C and E show the routing for Tile 1 while Figure 4 Details B and C show it for Tile 2.

Bias pads are placed in several locations on the inner _n\({}^{+}\)_ guard ring. They form two extra rows with the same 50\(\mu\)m pitch as the pixels have. See Figure 2, Detail F for an example of _n_-side bias pad placement.

Probing pads are placed on the inner guard ring in the region between adjacent units (see Figure 2, Detail F).

### _p_-side (back side) design

This information concerns both Tiles. A _p\({}^{+}\)_ implant is continuous in the area covered by pixels. The aluminization has \(30\times 100\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) apertures to facilitate stimulating the cells from the _p_-side with a laser. No unpassivated _n\({}^{+}\)_ implants or contacts to the _n_-bulk substrate are permitted. Redundant bond pads for _p_-side biasing are provided.

### Double metal

The manufacturers will apply insulator and a second metal layer to 30% of the First Prototypes. Devices with and without double metal will not differ in any aspect of their design other than the double metal itself, the insulator, and the addition of vias to allow access through the insulator to first metal pads. In the First Prototype program, double-metal is being tested in some (redundant) busses on Tile 2 and as routing of signals from pixels at the edge of units to preamplifiers above neighboring implants. The busses run parallel to the long side of the sensor and are located between bump bond pads and the active area. Figure 5 shows a detail of the bus structure on Tile 2.

The narrowest line in Metal 2 is 10\(\mu\)m wide and 1.5-2.0 \(\mu\)m thick. The minimum Metal 2 spacing, which is not critical, is greater than 20\(\mu\)m. In the bus structure, Metal 2 has width 20-50 \(\mu\)m. The contact holes are \(3\times 10\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) in the masks. Metal on the first layer has thickness 1.2-1.5 \(\mu\)m. The insulator material varies with manufacturer: one vendor will use SiO\({}_{2}\); the other, polyimide. To maintain flatness of the bump pads, vias are not located beneath them. Figure 7 shows the second metal design.

Devices that have Metal 1 but not Metal 2 will be completely functional. In the devices with both metal layers, the outermost four rows of pixels are not connected by bumps directly to their preamplifiers (i.e., their bump pads have no vias). Signals from pixels in those rows are instead routed in Metal 2 to neighboring pixels by using the same metal pattern as appears in Metal 1 in the sensor's central region.

### Passivation

The passivation must be compatible with technologies for applying bumps for bonding. A 1\(\mu\)m thick silicon nitride layer is used. The openings in the passivation for bump bonding have 12\(\mu\)m diameter.

## 4 Sensor Optical and Mechanical Properties

### Wafer thickness

During the prototyping phase of the pixel project, options for using thin sensors will be explored. First Prototype sensors from one manufacturer have thickness 300\(\mu\)m, while those from the other have thickness 280\(\mu\)m.

### Tolerances

The sensors must maintain the following tolerances:

* Uniformity of thickness: \(\pm 10\mu\)m
* Mask alignment: \(\pm 2\mu\)m

## 5 Sensor Electrical Properties

The following is a summary of the required electrical properties:

* Initial depletion voltage: \(50\)-\(1\,50\)V
* Initial maximum operating voltage: \(\geq 200\)V
* Initial leakage current (for 300 micron wafers): \(<100\) nA/cm\({}^{2}\)
* Initial oxide breakdown voltage: \(\geq 100\)V.

## 6 Testing

Acceptance testing will be done by ATLAS only. The wafer will have test structures for monitoring flat band voltage, layer thickness, implant resistivity, aluminum sheet resistance, etching uniformity, and alignment.

## 7 Processing

The following processing requirements must be met:

1. _n+_ implant dose: \(>10^{14}\)/cm\({}^{2}\).
2. concerning _n_-side isolation: * for Tile 1, the _p+_ implant dose should be \(\geq 10^{13}\)/cm\({}^{2}\).

* for Tile 2, the p-spray effective dose in silicon should be \(3\times 10^{1.2}/\)cm\({}^{2}\). Doping variation should be less than \(\pm 0.5\times 10^{1.2}/\)cm\({}^{2}\).
* Back contact (_p_-side) dose: \(>10^{14}/\)cm\({}^{2}\).
* Implant depth after processing is to be \(\geq 1\mu\)m.

## 8 Radiation Hardness

The following specifications _will be required_ for production sensors. They are _not required_ of prototypes sensors. The properties of irradiated prototype sensors will nonetheless be studied.

The production sensors must have the following performance after an irradiation of \(10^{1.5}\) p/cm\({}^{2}\):

1. Break down voltage: \(>500\) V.
2. Depletion voltage (for 300 micron sensors): \(<800\) V.
3. Leakage current (measured at \(-5^{\circ}\) C) after one month of annealing at \(20^{\circ}\) C (for 300 micron sensors): \(<12\,5\mu\)A/cm\({}^{2}\) or \(<25\) nA per pixel cell.
