**Abstract**

The prospects for the discovery of heavy lepton-neutrino resonances with the ATLAS detector are evaluated using full detector simulation. The performance of large missing transverse momentum measurement is studied. Its impact on the lepton-neutrino transverse mass reconstruction, and on the backgrounds rejection, is then discussed. As benchmark, the sensitivity to a Standard Model like \(W^{\prime}\) is evaluated. Emphasis is put on the discovery potential of ATLAS with early data, namely with an integrated luminosity of 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) to 10 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Introduction

The Standard Model of particle physics has been able to predict or describe, within errors, almost all measurements performed within its domain. However, several fundamental questions remain unresolved. Its mechanism for electroweak symmetry breaking has not been experimentally confirmed. The model parameters still lack a theoretical explanation. There are indications, therefore, that the Standard Model is not a fundamental theory, but a good approximation of nature at the energy ranges that have been so far accessible to experiment. Thus, the search for physics beyond the Standard Model is an important part of the ATLAS physics program. In this document, a study is presented of the potential for the search of final states comprised of one electron or muon (_lepton_, in what follows) plus missing transverse energy.

A large variety of theories beyond the Standard Model, predict additional gauge bosons. Any charged, spin 1 gauge boson which is not included in the Standard Model is called \(W^{\prime}\) boson and according to several predictions there is at least one \(W^{\prime}\) boson detectable at the LHC. These theories and models which predict new charged gauge bosons range from the Grand Unified Theories [1, 2, 3], the various Left-Right Symmetric Models [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], Kaluza-Klein theories [11, 12, 13, 14, 15], Little Higgs models [16, 17, 18], dynamical symmetry breaking models [19] and even models inspired from superstrings [20, 21, 22]. As an example, the 45 decompositions of the SO(10) gauge group, which is a candidate for large GUT symmetries, under the \(SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}\times U(1)_{B-L}\) gives rise to a (1,1,3,0) triplet coming from the \(SU(2)_{R}\) group. That is, a triplet of right-handed \(W^{\pm,0}\) fields, which carry weak (V+A) interactions. A theoretical model, based on the gauge group \(SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}\times U(1)_{B-L}\) which is called a Left-Right Symmetric Model (LRSM), after spontaneous symmetry breaking, predicts a right-handed \(W_{R}\) gauge boson mixes with the left-handed \(W_{L}\) boson of the Standard Model. The \(W_{R}\) gauge boson is a very attractive \(W^{\prime}\) boson candidate. The search for these particles is an important part of the studies for new physics to be performed at LHC. Studies presented here are based on predictions of a "Standard Model-like" \(W^{\prime}\) boson from so-called extended gauge models [23]. This \(W^{\prime}\) boson has Standard Model-like couplings to fermions and its decays to \(WZ\) bosons are suppressed.

The D0 experiment, at Fermilab, has set the present lower limit for the \(W^{\prime}\) boson mass [24] to \(m_{W^{\prime}}>1\) TeV at 95% C.L. The LHC, with a centre-of-mass energy of \(14\,\mathrm{TeV}\), is expected to increase the search reach even at early stages of data taking. Other ATLAS studies have evaluated the potential for discovery of \(W^{\prime}\to\ell\nu_{\ell}\) where \(\ell=\mu,e\)[25]. This study is based on the most recent realistic detector description, including a complete simulation of the trigger chain.

The remaining of this paper is organized as follows. The Monte Carlo samples which were used are summarized in section 2. Section 3 discusses the expected performance on lepton reconstruction, as well as on missing transverse energy. Section 4 briefly describes the triggers which were used in this study. The event selection is discussed in section 5. The discovery potential of a \(W^{\prime}\) with Standard Model couplings is assessed in section 7, after examining the systematic uncertainties in section 6.

## 2 Monte Carlo Samples

Table 1 summarizes the samples used in this study; a detailed account of the procedures, generators and settings used is given in [26]. Signal samples for masses other than 1 and 2 TeV were produced locally and validated against central production samples.

For the signal, samples of \(W^{\prime}\to\ell\nu\) events were generated with Pythia v6.403 [27], based on the leading order cross sections and the parton distribution functions CTEQ6 [28], where \(\ell\) can be any type of lepton (\(\tau\) included), for true \(W^{\prime}\) boson masses ranging from 1 to 4 TeV.

The main background for a \(W^{\prime}\)-type state is the high-mass tail of Standard Model \(W\) boson production; in order to provide enough background to study also the higher \(W^{\prime}\) boson masses, two samples of Standard Model \(W\) boson events were produced, with different requirements on the true invariant mass of the \(W\) boson: one with \(200\,\,\mathrm{GeV}<m_{W}<500\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\), and one with \(m_{W}>500\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\). In these studies, the alignment and calibration of the detector is assumed to be well described in the reconstruction algorithms.

## 3 Reconstruction Performance

### Muon Reconstruction

Muon reconstruction in ATLAS uses all main detector subsystems. The Muon Spectrometer (MS) is designed to provide efficient and precise stand-alone momentum measurement for muons of transverse momentum up to O(\(p_{T}\)= 1 \(\,\mathrm{TeV}\)). During the back-tracking of the muon to the production vertex, energy loss fluctuations can be measured with the use of the calorimeters, which can also provide independent muon tagging to increase the identification efficiency. For optimum performance in momentum resolution, the MS information is combined with the track information obtained in the Inner Detector (ID). A full description of the algorithms for muon performance and identification can be found in [29] and [30].

Figure 1 shows the inverse transverse momentum (\(1/p_{T}\)) resolution for muons from decays of a \(W^{\prime}\) boson for muons below \(p_{T}=400\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and above \(p_{T}=800\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Especially relevant for the analysis are the negative tails in these plots, since they correspond to reconstructed muon candidates that have a \(p_{T}\) larger than that of the true particle. The relative contribution of these tails can be assessed by the fraction of muon candidates separated by more than \(2\sigma\) from the mean of the distribution (which in both cases is consistent with zero, as it should). The fraction in that negative tail is \((4.9\pm 0.3)\%\) for muons with \(p_{T}<400\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\), and \((3.8\pm 0.4)\%\) for \(p_{T}>800\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\) (to be compared with 2.275% for a gaussian distribution). The transverse momentum resolution achieved is shown as a function of the

pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) in Fig. 2. On average a resolution of 4.5 and 5.5% is recorded for muons from \(W^{\prime}\) bosons of \(m=1\) TeV and 2 TeV respectively.

Figures 3 and 4 show the efficiency for combined muon reconstruction as a function of pseudo-rapidity (\(\eta\)), azimuthal angle (\(\phi\)) and transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) for muons from fully simulated \(W^{\prime}\) boson decays. An overall efficiency of 93.6% and 92.4% is measured for \(m=1\) TeV and 2 TeV \(W^{\prime}\) boson samples, respectively. The regions with lower efficiency in muon reconstruction are observed, as expected, in the middle plane (\(\eta=0\)) and in the transition regions between the barrel and the end-cap sections of the MS (at \(|\eta|\sim 1.2\)). The regions with low efficiency in \(\phi\) correspond to the feet of the detector (\(\phi\simeq-2\), \(-1\)) and to passages for services.

One important issue in this study concerns the background that can rise from badly reconstructed muons. Their momentum being wrongly estimated upwards, can cause both the presence of a high \(p_{T}\) muon and, correspondingly, large missing transverse energy. In the definition of the muon, extra quality criteria may be imposed in order to diminish this probability. In this study, the following mild requirements are adopted:

* An impact parameter in the \(z\)-axis (i.e. the beam axis) smaller than 200 mm.
* An impact parameter significance in the transverse (R-\(\phi\)) plane smaller than 10.

### Electron Reconstruction

Electron candidates are built starting from clusters of calorimeter cell energy depositions, which are matched to a track from the inner detector. Electron identification and reconstruction are described in detail in [31] and [32], where three standard selections were developed to be used in physics searches. The present study uses the _medium_ set of selection requirements, which consists in several requirements on the clusters used (size, containment, association with a track, shower shapes and quality of the track match).

Figure 5 shows the electron energy resolution (in percentage) as a function of pseudo-rapidity (\(|\eta|\)) and true energy. The average energy resolution for electrons in this energy range is close to 1%, and is worse in the transition region between the two calorimeter systems. Figure 6 shows the relative difference between reconstructed and true transverse momenta of isolated electrons with true \(p_{T}\) lower than 400 GeV and higher than 800 GeV. The fractions of events in the upper tails (more than \(2\sigma\) over the fitted mean) are \((11.8\pm 0.6)\)% and \((5.3\pm 0.5)\)%, respectively. These non-Gaussian tails are due to the amount of material in the inner detector and are, therefore, \(\eta\)-dependent.

### Reconstruction of the Missing Transverse Energy

The final state under consideration includes a neutrino, whose momentum information can be inferred only partially from the energy imbalance in the detector (since the total transverse momentum of the event has to add up to zero). The reconstruction of the missing transverse energy (\(\not{E}_{T}\)) in ATLAS is described in detail in [33].

The resolution of \(\not{E}_{T}\) reconstruction in \(W^{\prime}\) boson events containing muons can be seen in Fig. 7. An average resolution of about 18 GeV is observed for \(m_{W^{\prime}}=1\) TeV (25 GeV for \(m_{W^{\prime}}=2\) TeV). In the case of \(m_{W^{\prime}}=2\) TeV the non-Gaussian tails in the resolution are more pronounced, and come from the degraded performance of muon reconstruction at high \(p_{T}\).

Figure 7: \(\not{E}_{T}\) resolution in muonic \(W^{\prime}\) boson decays. \(m_{W^{\prime}}=1\) TeV (left) and \(2\) TeV (right).

Figure 8 shows the \(\not{E}_{T}\) resolution for events that contain one high-\(p_{T}\) electron from a \(W^{\prime}\) boson decay. The left plot corresponds to the \(m=\)1  TeV \(W^{\prime}\) boson, and the right plot to 2  TeV; the resolutions are around 10 and 14 GeV, respectively. These values agree well with the expected \(\not{E}_{T}\) resolution from the mean of the scalar sum of transverse energy (\(<\sum E_{T}>\)) in each case; for the \(m=1\)  TeV sample, \(<\sum E_{T}>\) for the selected events is 439 GeV, which yields an estimated \(\sigma(\not{E}_{T})\sim 0.5\sqrt{\sum E_{T}}=10.5\) GeV; for \(m=2\)  TeV, the expected value (based on \(<\sum E_{T}>\)) is 13.3 GeV.

### Transverse Mass Reconstruction

In the \(W^{\prime}\) boson search, the transverse momentum \(p_{T}\) of the single lepton in the event and the missing transverse energy \(\not{E}_{T}\) are combined to obtain the _transverse mass_ as follows:

\[m_{T}=\sqrt{2p_{T}\not{E}_{T}(1-cos\Delta\phi_{\ell,\not{E}_{T}})} \tag{1}\]

where \(\Delta\phi_{\ell,\not{E}_{T}}\) is the angle between the momentum of the lepton and the missing momentum, in the transverse plane. Figures 9 and 10 show the transverse mass distributions for \(m=1\) and 2  TeV signals, respectively, as obtained from truth information (light gray filled histograms) and the degradation due to detector resolution and efficiency (black hollow histograms). As can be expected from Figs. 2 and 5, the shape of the transverse mass spectrum has a larger distortion in the muon channel than in the electron channel, with larger tails for higher \(W^{\prime}\) boson masses. On the other hand, the reconstruction efficiency is higher in the muon channel (over 86% for each mass) than in the electron channel (about 72%).

Figures 11 and 12 show the distribution of the difference between the "true" transverse mass (i.e. as obtained from the true momenta of the lepton and the neutrino) and its reconstructed value, for electron and muon modes, and for \(m=1\) and 2  TeV \(W^{\prime}\) boson masses. In Fig. 11, single Gaussian fits are shown; a fitted width of about 12  GeV is obtained for the electron channel, while the muon channel, besides having much larger non-Gaussian tails, has a fitted width of about 23  GeV.

Figure 12 shows the corresponding comparison for a 2  TeV signal; however, in this case, the muon channel (on the right) has a stronger non-Gaussian character, which is why no fit was performed. The quadratic mean of the distribution is about 84 GeV.

Trigger

The ATLAS trigger [34] has three levels: events passed by the L1 (level 1) hardware trigger are partially reconstructed in L2 (level 2) processors and, if accepted there, are fully processed in the EF (event filter) processor farm. Only events accepted by the EF (and thus also by L1 and L2) are recorded for later reconstruction and analysis.

Trigger rates are estimated in separate studies of the electron [35] and muon [36] trigger systems. However, this studies were performed with a more recent version of the software than the one used here2. Therefore, we have measured some of the rates directly in simulation using the dijet and top samples described earlier in this note. We additionally measured L1 rates and efficiencies for single-electron and single-muon triggers with thresholds higher than those defined in the simulated trigger menu. The errors we assign to our rate estimates are purely statistical.

Footnote 2: Especially for electrons, the trigger menu and algorithms in the simulated samples are quite different from those in the above notes which are much closer to those expected to be used during actual data acquisition.

### Electron trigger

For a single electron trigger with an \(E_{T}\) threshold of 100 GeV, we measure a L1 rate of \(14\pm 1\) Hz at an instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), similar to the electron trigger study estimate of 10 Hz. The efficiency to trigger on \(W^{\prime}\to e\nu\) events for \(|\eta|<2.5\) is 98% for a mass of either 1 or 2 TeV. If the threshold is raised to 250 GeV, we measure a rate of \(25\pm 4\) Hz at \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and an efficiency of 96% for the 2 TeV mass.

Loose requirements in L2 and EF can further reduce these rates with a moderate degradation of the efficiency. For definiteness in the calculations in the following sections, we assume that a trigger efficiency (applied after all requirements) of \(0.90\pm 0.10\) is achieved with an acceptable rate for all \(W^{\prime}\) boson masses.

### Muon trigger

The trigger menu and algorithms in the simulation samples are similar to those in the muon trigger study and those expected for data acquisition. In contrast to the electron case, lower thresholds can be applied thanks to the lower fake rates. A significant decrease in rate is then obtained thanks to an improved measurement of \(p_{T}\) at each level. Applying a threshold of 20 GeV at each trigger level, we obtain an EF rate of \(20\pm 10\) Hz for an instantaneous luminosity of \(10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), consistent with the muon study prediction of 13 Hz. We measure a \(W^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu\nu\) trigger efficiency for \(|\eta|<2.5\) of 74% for \(m=1\) TeV and 73% at 2 TeV. At \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), we apply a \(p_{T}\) threshold of 40 GeV, the maximum L1 value, and obtain a trigger rate of \(4.1\pm 0.7\) Hz close to the 5.6 Hz obtained in the trigger study. The corresponding trigger efficiency for the \(m=2\) TeV \(W^{\prime}\) boson is 69%.

It should be noted that most of the efficiency loss comes from holes in the coverage of the muon system, where the reconstruction is also inefficient.

## 5 Event Selection

The decay \(W^{\prime}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) provides a rather clean signature consisting of a high-energy isolated lepton and large missing transverse energy. The largest backgrounds are the high-\(p_{T}\) tail of the \(W\rightarrow\ell\nu\) decays and \(t\bar{t}\) production. Both these final states are accompanied by significant jet activity, but contain also leptons that are as isolated as those expected from \(W^{\prime}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) decays.

A potentially dangerous background is the one arising from fake leptons; since this issue is more likely to be significant for electrons than for muons, the backgrounds will be presented separately for \(W^{\prime}\to e\nu\) and \(W^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu\nu\) final states.

### Event Preselection

In addition to the electron and muon identification criteria described above, events are required to have:

* Only one reconstructed lepton with \(p_{T}>50\,\) GeV within \(|\eta|<2.5\).
* Missing transverse energy \(\not{E}_{T}>50\,\) GeV.

Figure 13 shows, on top, differential cross-section as a function of the lepton \(p_{T}\) for the \(m=1\) TeV and 2 TeV signal samples, Standard Model \(W\) boson, \(t\bar{t}\) and dijet production. The dashed vertical line shows the requirement value (50  GeV). The bottom plots in Fig. 13 show the \(\not{E}_{T}\) distributions for the same processes after requiring only one lepton with \(p_{T}>50\,\)GeV; again, the requirement value (at 50  GeV) is shown with the dashed vertical line. This selection provides a relatively clean signal in the high transverse mass region, as shown in Fig. 14, which shows the differential cross-section as a function of the transverse mass after the requirements on \(p_{T}\) and \(\not{E}_{T}\). The background can be further rejected by exploiting additional observables, described in next sections: lepton isolation, lepton fraction and jet veto criteria.

Figure 13: Top: leading lepton \(p_{T}\) distributions (left: electron events, right: muon events). Bottom: \(\not{E}_{T}\) distribution of events with only one reconstructed lepton with \(p_{T}>50\,\) GeV (left: electron events, right: muon events).

### Background Rejection

After the kinematic requirements are applied, the \(t\bar{t}\) and dijets backgrounds are still larger than the high-mass tail of the Standard Model \(W\) boson close to the threshold value on the lepton \(p_{T}\) and on \(\not{E}_{T}\). Since the uncertainties on the rate of these backgrounds are large, it is desirable to bring them below the irreducible background from \(W\) bosons. To achieve this, additional requirements are imposed on lepton isolation and on the lepton fraction, described below. A simpler selection strategy, based on a jet veto, is also explored, since it could prove useful during the first stages of data taking.

#### 5.2.1 Lepton Isolation

As the lepton from a \(W^{\prime}\) boson decay is expected to be isolated, only events without high energy tracks around the lepton trajectory are accepted. The tracking isolation is done by requiring that the sum of the \(p_{T}\) of tracks in a \(\Delta R\)-cone around the lepton be below a threshold; \(\Delta R\) is defined as

\[\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}},\]

where \(\Delta\phi\) and \(\Delta\eta\) are the distances in azimuthal angle and in pseudo-rapidity, respectively, from the lepton under consideration.

Calorimeter isolation was also explored (the calorimetric energy deposited within the volume between two \(\Delta R\)-cones is required to be below a threshold).

Besides requiring a maximum value of \(\sum p_{\rm Trucks}\) (of 10 GeV to 1 GeV), the use of a _normalized_ isolation requirement was also explored, in which the requirement is applied to the \(\sum p_{\rm Trucks}/p_{\rm Tlepton}\) ratio. This ratio is required to be smaller than 0.1 to 0.01. Five different \(\Delta R\) values were used in both cases; as shown in Fig. 15 for muons, the normalized isolation selection achieves a higher \(t\bar{t}\) rejection for the same efficiencies. The efficiencies and rejections achieved for electrons are similar.

The calorimeter energy difference in two cones is not only of use in the electron case, but also in the muon one. High \(p_{T}\) muons coming from \(W^{\prime}\) boson decays can also radiate a lot inside the material preceding the MS. This radiation appears as energy depositions close to the muon in the calorimeters. As can be seen in Fig. 16 (right), the energy deposition in a cone of \(\Delta R<0.1\) around the muon is much higher, around 30 GeV on average, than the deposition in a cone of \(\Delta R<0.5\) when the inner cone is subtracted (in this case the average is about 7 GeV). Moreover, in Fig. 16 (left) it is shown that in the majority of the cases, a high reconstructed energy deposition indicates the existence of high final state radiation. Therefore, the energy deposition in an inner cone (e.g. \(\Delta R<0.1\)) must be subtracted also in

Figure 14: Transverse mass spectrum after the basic kinematic requirements for background and signal (\(m_{W^{\prime}}=1\) and 2 TeV). Left: electron mode; right: muon mode.

the case of muons when isolation criteria based on calorimetry are applied. Also on track based isolation criteria an inner cone containing the muon track itself must be subtracted. In this case however, the inner cone can be much narrower, since it only needs to be able to exclude the track associated with the lepton under consideration. Figure 17 shows the distributions of the isolation energy for different event categories. For these plots, muons with \(p_{T}>20\)  GeV are considered.

For the analysis, a loose requirement of 0.05 is used on the normalized track-based isolation for both channels (electron and muon), and no requirement on the calorimeter-based isolation is applied. Tracks are included in the sum if \(0.02<\Delta R(\mathrm{track},\mathrm{lepton})<0.3\). This requirement keeps about 99% of the signal for both masses (\(m_{W^{\prime}}=1\) and 2  TeV), rejects about 10% of the \(t\bar{t}\) events left after the basic selection and rejects over 99% of the dijet background.

#### 5.2.2 Lepton Fraction

Another variable that can be used to reduce the dijet and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds is the "lepton fraction" of the event, which can be expressed as \(\sum p_{T}^{leptons}/(\sum p_{T}^{leptons}+\sum E_{T})\), where the scalar sum on the lepton \(p_{T}\) sums over \(E_{T}\) as well. Essentially this variable measures the fraction of energy that can be attributed to leptons (including neutrinos, which are assumed to be the main contribution to \(E_{T}\)) in an event. Here,

Figure 16: Left: the true energy deposition as a function of the reconstructed one in a cone of \(\Delta R\)=0.1 for muons coming from decays of \(m=2\)  TeV \(W^{\prime}\) bosons. Right: the solid histogram shows the energy recorded in a cone of \(\Delta R\)=0.1 around the muon. The dashed histogram shows the energy recorded in a cone of \(\Delta R\)=0.5 after the subtraction of the inner cone deposition.

Figure 15: \(t\bar{t}\) background rejection and signal efficiency for different requirement values on the \(\sum p_{T}\) (open markers) and \((\sum p_{T})/p_{T\mathrm{lepton}}\) (filled markers), for the muon channel. Each marker type corresponds to a different value for \(\Delta R\), from 0.1 to 0.5.

out of the visible leptons, only the most energetic one is included in the sum (its \(p_{T}\) is added to the \(\not{E}_{T}\) to form \(\sum p_{T}^{leptons}\)). The distribution of this variable is shown for different event categories in Fig. 18 (left). As expected, it shows a much lower value for \(t\bar{t}\) events (in pink) than for the rest of the samples used (\(W^{\prime}\) boson signals and Standard Model \(W\) bosons). The efficiency for signal versus \(t\bar{t}\) events for different values of the variable, is shown in Fig. 18 (right). A requirement at 0.5 results in a signal efficiency of \(\sim 96\%\) in both channels and a rejection factor of \(\sim\)45 against the \(t\bar{t}\) background, and it suppresses all the remaining dijet events. This value will be used subsequently.

#### 5.2.3 Jet Veto and Jet Multiplicity Requirements

A selection procedure based solely on veto-ing events with high jet activity could provide an alternative way to extract a signal in this search. Several requirements on jet activity were explored; in some, events are rejected if they include any jet over an energy threshold, in others, jet multiplicity information is used. The jet veto was applied just after the basic selection (i.e., lepton identification, \(p_{T}\) and \(\not{E}_{T}\) requirements).

Figure 19 shows the distribution of the \(p_{T}\) of the leading jet after the basic selection; the distribution on the left corresponds to the electron channel and the one on the right to the muon channel. Tables 2 and 3 show the expected rates for several jet veto criteria.

Figure 17: Left: distribution of an absolute track based isolation variable for muons. Right: distribution of a relative calorimetry based isolation variable for muons. In both cases the inner cone of \(\Delta R\)=0.1 is subtracted.

Figure 18: Left: distribution of the lepton fraction variable (see text) for different event categories. Right: signal efficiency versus \(t\bar{t}\) efficiency for different requirement values on the lepton fraction variable.

Figure 20 shows how after a 200 GeV jet veto requirement (and without isolation or lepton fraction requirements), most of the \(t\bar{t}\) and dijet background is rejected, and the signal to background ratio is good for high transverse mass values. Although the signal is reduced by between 5 and 10% with respect to selecting on isolation and lepton fraction, a jet veto requirement may be a good tool if the calibration of the \(\sum E_{T}\) (used to compute the lepton fraction) is not well understood in early data. However, in what follows, this requirement is not used.

### Event Selection Results

Figure 21 shows the expected transverse momentum spectra for signal and background for both channels after all requirements (preselection, isolation, and lepton fraction). The selection requirement flow is shown in Tables 4 and 5. The transverse mass requirement has been chosen by minimizing the luminosity needed to get a 5\(\sigma\) excess. The initial cross-sections for the \(W^{\prime}\) boson signals and for the high mass \(W\) boson tail include the \(K\)-factor obtained in section 6.1.

## 6 Systematic Uncertainties

### Generator-level Systematic Uncertainties

The input for the full simulation studies described in earlier sections was obtained by generating \(W^{\prime}\) boson events using Pythia[27]. Events in the high-mass tail of the \(W\) boson were generated using Pythia as well. Both use the default Pythia parton distribution functions (PDFs), CTEQ6l, the CTEQ6 [37] LO (leading-order) fit with NLO (next-to-leading-order) \(\alpha_{S}\). Here we report on generator-level studies which examine the effects of making use of the NLO matrix elements and varying the PDFs.

#### 6.1.1 Higher Orders

To evaluate contributions from higher order diagrams, we used MC@NLO[38] input to the HERWIG[39] event generator. Both \(W\) and \(W^{\prime}\) boson events were generated using the \(W\) boson production process with the \(W\) boson mass set to the \(W^{\prime}\) boson value for the latter. The \(W^{\prime}\) boson widths were set to the values calculated by Pythia. The masses and widths used are listed in Table 6. Both MC@NLO and HERWIG were run using the default HERWIG PDFs, MRST2004nlo, the MRST 2004 fit using the standard \(\overline{\text{MS}}\) scheme at NLO[40].

One million events were generated for each generator at each of the masses. The cross-section is calculated for transverse mass above 70% of the \(W^{\prime}\) boson mass, i.e. above the values listed in Table 6.

We define the \(K\)-factor to be the ratio of the MC@NLO cross-section to that from Pythia. These are shown as functions of \(\eta\) in Fig. 22.

Integrals of the \(W^{\prime}\) boson and \(W\) boson tail differential cross-sections are given in Table 7. The NLO predictions are 30-40% higher than those from Pythia, with little change with the variations in scale. Although the NLO/LO cross-section and acceptance ratios are of order 40%, the uncertainties on the NLO values are expected to be significantly smaller. Also, the QED corrections are partially included

through PHOTOS [41] for FSR, and should have a small impact on the measurements in case of the observation of a signal.

#### 6.1.2 Parton Distribution Functions

The LHC will take data in a new energy regime and so we expect significant uncertainty in signal and background predictions due to our uncertainty in knowledge of the PDFs.

The CTEQ6.1 fits include 40 error PDFs corresponding to the two limits on each of 20 eigenvectors. These can be used to estimate the uncertainty in predictions obtained with the fit. Figure 23 shows the Pythia prediction for the \(m=1\) TeV \(W^{\prime}\) boson differential cross-section as a function of \(\eta\) for the CTEQ6.1 central value and each of the 40 error sets. Events are required to have transverse mass above the threshold in Table 6. The difference in shape between the positively and negatively charged bosons is a consequence of the parton distribution functions since \(W^{\prime+}\) are from \(ud\bar{d}\) fusion and \(W^{\prime-}\) from \(d\bar{u}\) fusion.

We calculated cross sections for \(W^{\prime}\) boson production with mass of 1 TeV using the CTEQ6.1 central value and error PDFs by integrating over the full \(\eta\) range (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) in Fig. 23. To estimate the overall uncertainty, the positive and negative deviations for each eigenvector were summed separately in quadrature for each charge sign. Where both deviations for an eigenvector had the same sign, only the larger magnitude was included in the sums. Table 8 shows the results.

Combining all the above, we assign a common \(K\)-factor of 1.37 for all masses and charges and assign an 8% uncertainty on this factor.

### Instrumental Uncertainties

Detector related uncertainties for these studies can be divided in two categories: the ones related to the reconstruction of the leptons and the ones corresponding to the global event activity as the \(\not{E}_{T}\) and the jet characteristics. However, the lepton reconstruction uncertainties can be the dominant factor in the \(\not{E}_{T}\) resolution.

#### 6.2.1 Lepton Reconstruction

Three main contributions can be identified in this category. The efficiency of lepton identification, as well as the fake rates associated with this, the \(p_{T}\) or \(E_{T}\) scale and its measurement resolution.

Systematic errors on the momentum scale of the muons can arise for instance due to the non-perfect knowledge of the magnetic field. To take into account such effects, a variation of \(\pm 1\%\) is applied to the \(p_{T}\) of the reconstructed muons. Positive and negative variations are considered separately. In a similar way but for energy, a variation of \(\pm 0.5\%\) was made for electrons.

An incomplete understanding of the material distributions inside the detector as well as possible misalignments in the MS can lead to an additional smearing of the momentum measurement resolution of muons. To evaluate the impact of such contributions on the analysis, a smearing, based on early calibrations of \(\sigma(1/p_{T})=0.011/p_{T}\oplus 0.00017\) is applied. The first term enhances the Coulomb scattering smearing, while the second enhances the alignment contribution, and is the crucial factor in this study.

For the energy measurement resolution for electrons, the total \(\sigma(E_{T})\) is smeared by \(0.0073\times E_{T}\), which enhances the constant term only.

Lepton identification efficiency is obviously important for this analysis. The identification efficiency can be estimated from the data, using the tag-and-probe method described in [42] for muons in the region \(20<p_{T}<50\) GeV and extrapolated to higher \(p_{T}\) using simulated data. A value of \(\pm 5\%\) has been chosen for the evaluation of this uncertainty, corresponding to the early running period of integrated luminosities \({\cal L}<100\) pb\({}^{-1}\). In the case of electrons a \(\pm 1\%\) variation has been applied.

Figure 23: Muon \(\eta\) distributions for positively- and negatively-charged \(m=1\) TeV \(W^{\prime}\) bosons using the CTEQ 6.1 PDF central value (black) and 40 error sets.

#### 6.2.2 Jet Reconstruction

An uncertainty on the jet energy scale of \(\pm 7\%\) was imposed, together with an uncertainty on its resolution of \(\sigma(E_{T})=0.45\times\sqrt{E_{T}}\oplus 5\%\).

#### 6.2.3 Missing Energy

If jets or leptons are systematically shifted, then missing transverse energy should be systematically shifted in a known direction. Based on the jet and leptons performance, the missing energy is shifted as follows:

* \(\not{E}_{T\,(shifted)}(x)=\not{E}_{T}(x)+E^{lepton/jet}(x)-E^{lepton/jet}_{ shifted}(x)\)
* \(\not{E}_{T\,(shifted)}(y)=\not{E}_{T}(y)+E^{lepton/jet}(y)-E^{lepton/jet}_{ shifted}(y)\)
* \(\sum E_{T\,(shifted)}=\sum E_{T\,}+E^{lepton/jet}_{T\,(shifted)}-E^{lepton/ jet}_{T\,(shifted)}\)

In the case of muons, momentum is used instead of energy.

#### 6.2.4 Summary of Experimental Systematic Uncertainties

The effects of the experimental uncertainties are summarized in Tables 9 and 10.

In the high-\(p_{T}\) range under consideration, the systematic uncertainties on the quality of single lepton reconstruction have a stronger effect on the muon channel, for which there are comparable contributions from energy scale, resolution and identification efficiency (with the resolution uncertainty becoming more important for a higher \(W^{\prime}\) mass); out of these three, the energy scale uncertainty dominates in the electron channel for \(m_{W^{\prime}}=1\) TeV, but becomes less important for \(m_{W^{\prime}}=2\) TeV. Jet uncertainties do not play a strong role on either channel.

## 7 Discovery Potential

In order to assess the ATLAS discovery potential in the search for a \(W^{\prime}\rightarrow\ell+\not{E}_{T}\) signal, the luminosity needed for a \(5\sigma\) excess is obtained as a function of the mass of the \(W^{\prime}\) boson.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{electrons} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{muons} \\ \cline{2-5} Description of systematic & \(\delta_{s}\) [\%] & \(\delta_{b}\) [\%] & \(\delta_{s}\) [\%] & \(\delta_{b}\) [\%] \\ \hline \hline Lepton energy scale + & +0.8 & +1.8 & +1.2 & +4.6 \\ Lepton energy scale - & -0.7 & -2.1 & -1.2 & -4.4 \\ Lepton energy resolution & +0.1 & +0.2 & -1.0 & +3.7 \\ Lepton identification efficiency + & +1.0 & +1.0 & +5. & +5. \\ Lepton identification efficiency - & -1.0 & -1.0 & -5. & -5. \\ Jet energy scale + & +0.1 & -0.2 & -0.1 & +0.1 \\ Jet energy scale - & +0.1 & -0.2 & +0.1 & +0.7 \\ Jet energy resolution & +0.0 & +0.1 & -0.1 & +0.3 \\ \hline Luminosity & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(\pm 3\).} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(\pm 3\).} \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 9: Effect of the detector systematics in percentage for \(m_{W^{\prime}}=1\) TeV. \(\delta_{s}\) is the uncertainty on the signal, \(\delta_{b}\) is the uncertainty on the background.

The significance is obtained from the expected number of signal and background events in the region \(m_{T}>0.7m_{W^{\prime}}\), where \(m_{W^{\prime}}\) is the mass of the hypothesized \(W^{\prime}\) boson. Calling these expected numbers \(s\) and \(b\), respectively, the significance \(S\) is obtained as

\[S=\sqrt{2((s+b)\ln(1+s/b)-s)}\]

which gives a good approximation to the likelihood-ratio based significance in the low statistics regime. Figure 24 shows the expected integrated luminosity needed for a 5-sigma excess as a function of the mass of the \(W^{\prime}\) boson.

Higher order corrections for \(W^{\prime}/W\to\ell\nu\) processes are taken into account as stated in section 6.1. Systematic uncertainties listed in Tables 9 and 10 are taken into account by increasing the expected background by the sum in quadrature of its positive expected variations, and by reducing the signal by the sum in quadrature of its expected negative variations; this assumes no correlations of the expected signal and background expectations and, as a result, produces a conservative estimate.

For comparison, the integrated luminosity values for a \(5\sigma\) significance were also obtained taking into account the shape of the signal and background \(m_{T}\) distributions. This was done using a technique in which, instead of an ensemble of Monte Carlo pseudo-experiments [43], a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is used to calculate the experimental estimator distributions [44]. This method allows a fast determination of the probability that background fluctuations produce a signal-like result, but it depends on the assumption that both the location of the signal and its shape are well known. Treating each bin of the transverse mass distribution as an independent search channel, and combining them accordingly, the resulting sensitivity is in general higher than the estimation given in the number counting approach. With this method, the luminosity required for a \(5\sigma\) effect was reduced between 20 and 35% with respect to the values shown in Fig. 24.

Even for very low integrated luminosities (of the order of picobarns), a \(W^{\prime}\) boson with a mass above the current experimental limits could be found with a significance in excess of \(5\sigma\), while, with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), masses of the order of 3 TeV can be reached. As an illustration, Figs 25 and 26 show Monte Carlo outcomes of pseudo-experiments corresponding to 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) and 100 pb\({}^{-1}\), respectively, for both channels. The solid line histograms depict the expected background, those in dotted lines the \(m=1\) TeV \(W^{\prime}\) boson signal and the dashed-dotted line histograms show possible \(m=2\) TeV \(W^{\prime}\) boson signals.

Summary and Conclusion

The potential for the ATLAS experiment to reconstruct and identify the decay of a heavy, charged gauge boson into a lepton and a neutrino has been studied. Various systematic and theoretical uncertainties have been considered, as well as plausible estimations of our uncertainties about the performance of the detector in the early stages of data taking. These studies show that, even with integrated luminosities as low as 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data, it would be possible to discover this type of bosons, should they exist not far beyond the current experimental limits and have Standard Model like couplings. With an integrated luminosity of a few fb\({}^{-1}\), ATLAS has the potential to discover these particles for masses up to 4 TeV.
