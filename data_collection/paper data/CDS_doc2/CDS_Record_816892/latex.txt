###### Abstract:

In the universal extra dimension scenario, Kaluza-Klein (KK) states of quarks and gluons could be produced at the LHC. In the presence of additional large extra dimensions, these states will decay gravitationally. One possible signal would be an excess of dijets with large accompanying missing energy. We have re-calculated the cross sections for direct production of two partonic KK states, following Macesanu _et al._. We then produced a Monte Carlo generator and used it in combination with ATLFAST to evaluate the reach with ATLAS. We find that a compactification scale as high as 2.7 TeV can be probed with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 1 Introduction

The recent extension of string theory to M-theory has brought the unexpected possibility of an experimental reach for some string predictions [1]. Indeed, the possibility that all known non-gravitational particles might be trapped on a 4-dimensional surface (3-brane) embedded in a higher dimensional bulk space allows the string scale to be as low as the weak scale, thus providing a low energy description of the gravitational interaction. These considerations have sparked considerable interest on the low energy phenomenology of string inspired models with large compact extra dimensions [2, 3, 4].

Requiring that the models be testable at reachable energies provides encouragement to consider theories with a low number of large extra dimensions. If there is more than one extra dimension, string theory allows the possibility to devise models with asymmetrical compactification, i.e. with compactified dimensions of different radii. If these dimensions are large, Standard Model particles must be confined to a brane since the gauge interactions are known up to a distance scale of \(10^{-3}\) fm (corresponding to TeV). Such a large extra dimension scenario need not be inconsistent with the presence of _additional_ small extra dimensions of \(<\) TeV\({}^{-1}\)-size, in which SM particles are allowed to propagate. This leads to interesting theoretical consequences. For example, models where such extra dimensions are probed by gauge bosons only will provide gauge coupling unification at the weak scale and a new mechanism for supersymmetry breaking [5, 6, 7]. The same theoretical consequences apply as well to more democratic models, called Universal Extra Dimension (UED) models, where all the SM particles, including fermions, have access to TeV\({}^{-1}\) size extra-dimensions. Moreover, these UED models suffer from looser experimental constraints [5, 8] because Kaluza-Klein (KK) number conservation requires that vertices involve two KK excitations. Indirect effects from virtual KK states would not, therefore, be manifest at colliders and only direct pair-production would be possible 1 To be precise, in fat brane scenarios, single production is possible, but is gravitationally coupled. The case of single production has been considered by [9] meaning that present bounds on the masses of KK states are relatively low. Moreover, in such models, in the absence of a special mechanism, the lowest lying KK-modes of the light fermions and of the gauge bosons are predicted to be stable. However, loop level contributions can cause higher modes (n\(>1\)) to decay [10, 11]. Possible decay mechanisms for the lightest excited mode have been proposed [5, 10, 12, 13]. Mechanisms where the UED thick brane is embedded in a large extra dimension bulk space constitute interesting models since they benefit from the advantage of both the TeV\({}^{-1}\)-size and the large extra dimensions models such as, for example, the stabilization of the Higgs boson mass [14, 15], the possibility to provide a test for quantum gravity [16, 3] and even solving the cumbersome cosmological constant problem [17, 18].

Footnote 1: \({}^{1}\),

Lower and higher experimental bounds on the compactification scale \(M_{C}\sim 1/R\) of UED models with only one TeV\({}^{-1}\)-size extra dimension can be estimated, as shown in [5]. The scale \(M_{C}\) is most strongly constrained at the lower end from precision electroweak measurements which would obtain contributions from KK states at the one-loop level, more precisely from the contribution of the KK modes associated to the top quark and the Higgs bosons. The current lower bound from LEP on the \(T\) parameter of Peskin and Takeushi [19], which encodes the splitting in the W and Z masses due to physics beyond the Standard Model, leads to a lower bound on the compactification scale of approximately \(M_{C}\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$>$}}300\) GeV. There is no relevant constraint from the new physics correction to the electroweak gauge boson propagators, encoded in the S parameter. This bound is however slightly raised by the current limit on direct production of KK excitations at colliders. Run II of the Tevatron sets this lower limit at about 350-400 GeV. At the higher end, the electroweak scale sets a natural theoretical limit on the compactification scale. In fact, since the minimal Standard Model in \(4+d\) dimensions has gauge, Yukawa and quartic-Higgs dimensionful couplings, it is an effective theory valid below some cutoff scale. To avoid fine-tuning the parameters in the Higgs sector, and in order for the D-dimensional theory to remain perturbative for a range of energies above \(M_{C}\), the compactification scale should not be much higher than the weak scale \(M_{W}\)[5]. Energies achievable at the LHC will therefore cover a significant part of the theoretical parameter space.

In this work, we perform a detailed analysis of dijet signals in the ATLAS detector arising from KK states of quarks and gluons in the embedded UED model. For simplicity, we consider a single TeV\({}^{-1}\)-size extra dimension since the LHC will be most sensitive to the largest of these and since bounds from two or more such dimensions are not well determined [5]. We provide a realistic upper limit on the value of the compactification scale \(M_{C}\) which can be detected at the LHC. More precisely we will first show that a value of \(M_{C}\) close to the present lower bound would provide a clear signal of the existence of Universal Extra Dimension embedded in a bulk of large extra dimension, and we will then give the maximum value that \(M_{C}\) can take and still allow a \(5\sigma\) discovery with the ATLAS detector. But first, we summarize, following [5, 10], the phenomenology of the model.

## 2 Physical Predictions

The class of models of present interest2 are those for which all the Standard Model particles reside on a thick brane, i.e. on a four-dimensional world sheet having a small thickness due to a compactified extra dimension of the TeV\({}^{-1}\) size. At high energy (above the TeV scale) the de Broglie wavelength of the SM fields becomes smaller than the size of this extra dimension, and the SM particle wavefunction travels in a fifth dimension subject to boundary conditions. (We compactify on a \(S_{1}/Z_{2}\) orbifold (\(S_{1}:y\to y+2\pi R\), \(Z_{2}:y\rightarrow-y\)) to provide matching of the zero mode with the observed SM particle [5]). From the equivalent four-dimensional point of view, this means that SM KK-modes, obtained by a Fourier expansion in terms of the compactified dimension \(y\), can be produced at energies higher than \(\sim 1\) TeV. This thick brane is then embedded in a bulk space of two large extra dimensions, for example. We will assume that any other extra dimensions, as predicted by string theory, are too small to be tested phenomenologically. This choice is favoured in some models, for cosmological reasons [17, 18]. The KK modes produced in the final state _may_ undergo interactions within the TeV\({}^{-1}\)-thick brane, but will rapidly decay to the zero-mode, with a graviton escaping in the large extra dimensions. For simplicity, and because we can hardly experimentally distinguish between gravitons and other gravitational bulk modes, we will assume that the KK modes decay to a graviton with a branching ratio of one, but further analysis will be required to account for all the other possible degrees of freedom into which KK modes can decay. With this simplification, we compute physical predictions for direct production of stable KK modes but experimentally analyze the signature of decaying KK modes. Since we are interested in LHC implications of this specific UED scenario, our focus will be on the phenomenology of parton subprocesses that involve the direct pair-production of KK excitations of gluons, \(g^{*}\), and two distinct KK quark towers, \(q_{n}^{\bullet}\) and \(q_{n}^{\circ}\) (see later).

From the 5D generalization of the kinematic and interaction terms of quarks and gluons in the SM Lagrangian density:

\[{\cal L}_{5}=-\frac{1}{4}{\cal G}^{a}_{MN}(x,y){\cal G}^{MNa}(x,y)-i\bar{Q}(x,y )\{\Gamma^{M}[\partial_{M}+ig_{5}T^{a}G^{a}_{M}(x,y)]\}Q(x,y) \tag{1}\]

where \({\cal G}^{a}_{MN}\) is the gluon field strength \({\cal G}^{a}_{MN}=\partial_{M}G^{a}_{N}-\partial_{N}G^{a}_{M}+g_{5}f^{abc}G^{b} _{M}G^{c}_{N}\), \(G^{a}_{M}\) the gluon field, \(g_{5}\) is the 5D strong coupling, M is the 5D analog of the Lorentz index \(\mu\), i.e. \(M\in\{\mu,4\}\), \(\Gamma^{M}\) are the gamma matrices in \(4+1\) dimensions and \(T^{a}\) are the Lie algebra generators of the \(SU_{c}(3)\) symmetry; and by the KK decomposition of the 5D fields into 4D fields plus KK modes:

\[Q(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi R}}\left\{\binom{u(x)}{d(x)}_{L}\right._{L}+ \left.\sqrt{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}[Q^{n}_{L}(x)\cos\left(\frac{ny}{R}\right)+Q ^{n}_{R}(x)\sin\left(\frac{ny}{R}\right)]\right\}\] \[G^{a}_{\mu}(x,y) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi R}}\left[G^{a}_{\mu 0}(x)\right.+\left. \sqrt{2}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}G^{a}_{\mu,n}(x)\cos\left(\frac{ny}{R}\right)\right]\] \[G^{a}_{4}(x,y) = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{\pi R}}\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}G^{a}_{4,n}(x) \sin\left(\frac{ny}{R}\right)\]

the Lagrangian density for the lowest KK mode (n=1), after integration on the orbifold of the fifth dimension, is:

\[{\cal L}_{int}= - g\left\{\bar{q}(x)\gamma^{\mu}T^{a}q(x)G^{a}_{\mu,0}(x)-\frac{1 }{2}f^{abc}G^{b}_{\mu 0}(x)G^{c}_{\nu 0}(x)[\partial^{\mu}G^{\nu a}_{0}(x)- \partial^{\nu}G^{\mu a}_{0}]\right.\] \[+ 3f^{abc}G^{b}_{\mu 0}G^{c}_{\nu 1}(x)[\partial^{\mu}G^{\nu a}_{ 1}(x)-\partial^{\nu}G^{\mu a}_{1}(x)]\] \[+ [\overline{q}^{\bullet}_{1}(x)\gamma^{\mu}T^{a}q^{\bullet}_{1}(x )+\widetilde{q}^{\circ}_{1}(x)\gamma^{\mu}T^{a}q^{\circ}_{1}(x)]G^{a}_{\mu,0}(x)\] \[+ [\bar{q}(x)P_{L}\gamma^{\mu}T^{a}q^{\bullet}_{1}(x)+\bar{q}^{ \bullet}_{1}(x)\gamma^{\mu}T^{a}P_{L}q(x)]G^{a}_{\mu,1}(x)\] \[+ [\bar{q}(x)P_{R}\gamma^{\mu}T^{a}q^{\circ}_{1}(x)+\bar{q}^{ \circ}_{1}(x)\gamma^{\mu}T^{a}P_{R}q(x)]G^{a}_{\mu,1}(x)\big{\}}\]

where the \(q^{\bullet}_{1}\) and \(q^{\circ}_{1}\) correspond respectively to the first KK excitation of quark fields with left-handed and right-handed chiralities. These two towers of states couple identically in strong interaction.

We recognize on the first line the SM interaction terms of quarks and gluons, while all the other terms involve the coupling of one SM field with two KK excitations of SM partons. The mass of the KK excitation is due to the quantization of the momentum of the 5D fields in the TeV\({}^{-1}\) extra dimension. This is the only source of mass for the excited gluons \(g^{*}_{n}\). However, if we consider the Yukawa couplings of the 5D quarks multiplets via the Higgs _vev_, we will have an additional mass contribution for the quarks. Diagonalizing the mass matrix yields the net mass \(M_{n}\) of the KK modes in terms of the mass of the corresponding quark field \(M_{q}\) and the mass from the compactification scale \(n/R\):

\[M_{n}=\sqrt{\frac{n^{2}}{R^{2}}+M_{q}^{2}} \tag{2}\]

Since \(1/R\sim{\cal O}({\rm TeV^{-1}})\), in our subsequent calculations we will neglect the SM quark masses except for the top quark, \(M_{t}\). This approximate degeneracy of all the KK states of a given mode means that the first mode of each quark is stable from the UED point of view and can only decay by graviton emission. This is only true at tree level. Loop processes can lift this degeneracy, however [11], allowing decay cascades ending with the lightest KK particle (LKP) which can then eventually decay by gravitational interaction:

\[q_{1}^{\bullet}\rightarrow q\ Z_{1}^{\ast}\ \ \rightarrow\ \ q\ l\ l_{1}^{\bullet}\ \ \rightarrow\ \ q\ l\ \gamma_{1}^{\ast},\ \ \ \ \ {\rm Br.}\ \sim 33\%\] \[q_{1}^{\bullet}\rightarrow q\ W_{1}^{\ast}\ \rightarrow\ \ q\ l^{\prime}\ l_{1}^{\bullet}\ \ \rightarrow\ \ q\ l^{\prime}\ l\ \gamma_{1}^{\ast},\ \ \ \ {\rm Br.}\ \sim 65\%\]

Here, we will not consider these decays, but we will only be concerned with either stable \(n=1\) modes, or gravity-mediated decays in the fat brane scenario. We will not consider \(n=2\) modes or higher excitations, as they will be strongly kinematically suppressed. Also, since we can neglect the content of top flavor in the colliding protons, the only two processes that can involve top quarks are \(gg\to t^{\bullet}\bar{t}^{\bullet}\) and \(q\bar{q}\to t^{\prime\bullet}\bar{t}^{\bullet}\) and the analogous subprocesses for the \(t^{\circ}\)'s. Since their cross section is small compared to the sum of all processes, we will neglect them and will thus not consider KK top production and decay.

The Feynman rules for \(n=1\) can be directly read from the previous Lagrangian density. They are computed in reference [10] and reported for any \(n\) in the appendix. The KK propagators involved in the relevant diagrams are given, for gluons and quarks respectively, by [10; 20]:

\[-i\Delta_{\mu\nu}^{ab}(p^{2}) = -i\delta^{ab}\frac{g_{\mu\nu}-\frac{p_{\mu}p_{\nu}}{M_{KK}^{2}}} {p^{2}-M_{KK}^{2}} \tag{3}\] \[-i\Delta^{a^{\prime}b^{\prime}}(p^{2}) = i\delta^{a^{\prime}b^{\prime}}\frac{\not{p}+M_{KK}}{p^{2}-M_{KK} ^{2}} \tag{4}\]

The differential cross section for the direct production of the different processes that yield two \(n=1\) KK partons in the final state have been calculated in reference [10]. However, we found and reported to the authors a few errors in their published results, some of which were typographical. Since many subprocesses were off, in some cases by more than one order of magnitude, we recalculated the differential cross section for every subprocess in order to obtain a proper evaluation of the total production rate for pairs of KK partons at the LHC. The calculations have been tested by evaluating them in the massless limit where these KK partons become SM particles. The corrected differential cross sections are reported in the appendix.

The total cross section can be obtained, by convoluting the parton level differential cross section with the Parton Distribution Function (PDF), integrating over the phase space and finally summing on the quark flavors. The general expression is:

\[\sigma^{tot}(pp\to 2\text{-KK})=\sum_{j}\int\limits_{\frac{4M_{1}^{2}}{s}} ^{1}\!\!dx_{A}\!\int\limits_{\frac{4M_{1}^{2}}{s\pi_{B}}}^{1}\!\!dx_{B}\ \ f(x_{A},Q)f(x_{B},Q) \tag{5}\] \[\times\int\limits_{-1}^{1}\!\!dz\frac{\pi\sum|\mathcal{M}_{j}|^{2 }}{2\hat{s}}\sqrt{1-\frac{4M_{1}^{2}}{\hat{s}}}\]

where the functions \(f\) are the CTEQ5L PDF [21], \(j\) runs over the processes enumerated above and \(z=\cos\theta\) with the cosine given by the relation \(\hat{t}=-\frac{\hat{s}}{2}(1-\sqrt{1-\frac{4M_{1}^{2}}{\hat{s}}}\cos\theta)+M _{1}^{2}\) in the center of mass system. The numerical integration is performed with PYTHIA [22] which also selects the events and performs the hadronization, the initial state and the final state radiation. In Table 1, we list the processes of interest with their computed cross section for a KK mass of 1.3 TeV. Adding all these numbers yields a total cross section of 2.4 pb, which is large enough to be detectable easily at the LHC. Of course, this cross section drops with increasing value of the compactification scale \(M_{KK}\), as can be seen in figure 1.

Once produced, the KK-states are instantaneously forced to decay into a graviton plus the parton associated with this KK particle. Since we neglect the potential coupling of KK-states with any gravitational fields other than the graviton, we consider that the branching ratio of this decay is 1. The total cross section for direct production of a pair of KK-states will therefore be unaffected, but the kinematics of the events will depend on the details of the decay process. Since it is not performed by PYTHIA, we implemented it explicitly, based on ref [12].

First, we needed to sample graviton masses \(M_{G}\) following the distribution function \(\frac{d\Gamma}{dM_{G}}\) where:

\[\Gamma=\frac{2\pi\bar{M}_{pl}}{M_{D}^{4}}\int_{r^{-1}}^{M_{KK}}dM_{G}M_{G} \frac{|\vec{p}_{i}|}{M_{KK}^{2}}|\mathcal{F}_{1}(\frac{M_{G}}{M_{KK}})|^{2} \tag{6}\]

\(\bar{M}_{pl}\) being the reduced 4D Planck mass, \(M_{D}\) the fundamental Planck scale and \(p_{i}\) the momentum of the decaying KK modes, and where \(\mathcal{F}_{1}\) is the form factor that relates the couplings of the graviton fields to the UED fields with the corresponding couplings of the graviton fields to the SM fields:

\[|\mathcal{F}_{1}(\frac{M_{G}}{M_{KK}})|^{2}=\frac{4M_{G}^{2}}{\pi^{2}(M_{KK}^ {2}-M_{G}^{2})}(1+\cos(\pi\frac{M_{G}}{M_{KK}})) \tag{7}\]After performing the integration numerically we reproduced the \(\frac{d\Gamma}{dM_{G}}\) distribution of ref [12], which confirms that this mechanism provides for a very rapid decay over almost all of the parameter space as we argued before. Next, we forced the decay in the rest frame of the KK parton, and performed a Lorentz boost to the lab frame before filling the simulated event.

We now analyze the results of our simulation, taking the backgrounds into account, to determine what the expected significance of such a signal is and for what mass range ATLAS is sensitive.

## 3 Detailed Simulations

To perform a detailed analysis of the expected signals, accounting for Standard Model backgrounds, and incorporating detector effects, we first assign incoming parton fla

vors for each event according to the CTEQ5L parton distribution functions [21] evaluated at the renormalization scale \(Q^{2}=M_{n}^{2}+p_{T}^{2}\) and we apply color flow between these partons. The backgrounds are described in the next subsection. ATLAS detector effects are incorporated using the fast Monte Carlo program ATLFAST [23].

### Standard Model Backgrounds

The phenomenology of interest is the production of a pair of KK partons each of which immediately decays into its associated parton plus a graviton. Since the graviton will quickly escape into the large extra dimensions, the signal that we are looking for is two energetic jets accompanied by a large amount of missing energy, or \(\hbox to 0.0pt{/}\hskip 1.0pt\hbox{/}_{T}\). The Standard Model backgrounds for this process involve two jets and neutrinos in the final state. The principal backgrounds having these features are \(pp\to 2\) jets \(+Z(\rightarrow\nu\nu)\) and \(pp\to 2\) jets \(+W(\rightarrow\ell\nu)\) where we miss the lepton. Although PYTHIA does not generate these \(Z/W+2-jets\) events from matrix element calculations, it does generate \(Z+jet\) and \(W+jet\) events with additional energetic jets produced from initial or final state QCD radiation and from parton showering. In order to estimate the systematic error due to this approximate simulation of the second jet, we will need to use a next-to-leading order generator such as Sherpa [24] which simulates \(Z/W+2\)-\(jets\) with matrix element code. Here, we will be content, in a first analysis, with the estimate of PYTHIA.

The simulated backgrounds and their cross sections in the phase space region \(E_{T,jet}^{\mbox{min}}>100\) GeV and \(E_{T,jet}^{\mbox{min}}>250\) GeV are given in table 2 while the cross sections for different mass scenarios of the signal with \(E_{T,jet}^{\mbox{min}}>250\) GeV can be read from figure 1 (\(\sigma=1.96\) pb in the case \(M_{KK}=1.3\) TeV).

### Analysis

Here, we first apply experimental selection criteria to the sample of simulated data in order to isolate our signal. We then use these cuts to quantify the largest size of the compactification scale (\(M_{C}=\frac{1}{R}\approx M_{1}\)) which can be expected to be detectable

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Processes & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{cross-section (pb)} \\ \cline{2-3}  & 100 GeV & 250 GeV \\ \hline \hline \(pp\rightarrow\)jet\(+Z(\rightarrow\nu\nu)\) & 129.1 & 5.11 \\ \hline \(pp\rightarrow\)jet\(+W(\to e\nu_{e})\) & 176.7 & 6.75 \\ \hline \(pp\rightarrow\)jet\(+W(\rightarrow\mu\nu_{\mu})\) & 176.7 & 6.75 \\ \hline \(pp\rightarrow\)jet\(+W(\rightarrow\tau\nu_{\tau})\) & 176.6 & 6.74 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

at a \(5\sigma\) significance with the ATLAS detector. Throughout this analysis, jets are reconstructed using the cone algorithm with a cone radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}=0.4\). In the ATLAS detector, leptons are detected if they are emitted in the range of pseudo-rapidity \(-2.5<\eta<2.5\). They are also defined as isolated if the energy deposited by other particles in a cone of radius \(\Delta R\) is less that 10 GeV.

As a first cut we require:

**Cut 1:** No isolated lepton (electron or muon) with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV allowed

in the event.

This eliminates most of the \(W\to e\nu_{e}\) and \(W\rightarrow\mu\nu_{\mu}\) events, leaving only those for which the leptons are not properly reconstructed in the detector. It does not eliminate events such as \(W+jet\rightarrow\tau\nu_{\tau}+jet\) in which the \(\tau\) decays hadronically.

We will first want to eliminate the dominant background, i.e. the \(pp\rightarrow\mbox{jet}+Z\rightarrow\mbox{jet}+\nu\nu\). Since we expect to have two high energetic jets in our signal coming from the decay of the two final state KK partons, it is useful to compare the transverse momentum distributions of the two most energetic jets of the signal events with the corresponding distributions for the background sample. This comparison is shown in Fig. 2. It is clear, from this figure, that with the following cuts:

**Cut 2:** Only events with a jet having a transverse momentum greater than 250 GeV are kept: (\(p_{T}^{jet-1}>250\) GeV).

Figure 2: Comparison of the \(p_{T}\) distributions of the two most energetic jets for the signal (\(M_{KK}=1.3\) TeV) and the background.

**Cut 3:** We keep only events for which \(p_{T}^{jet-2}>150\) GeV, where jet-2 is the jet with second-highest \(p_{T}\).

combined to the **Cut 1**, we can reject most of the background events (\(\sim 92\%\) for W+jets and \(\sim 96\%\) of the Z+jets events) while keeping most of the signal. (About \(35\%\) of the signal events are lost by these two cuts).

For the \(W+jet\to\tau\nu_{\tau}+jet\) background, we expect, in this case, to have also an energetic low-multiplicity jet opposite, in the azimuthal plane, to the principal jet. Following [18, 25], a cut on the difference in azimuthal angles between the two most energetic jets is found to help in eliminating this \(\tau\) background. Indeed, even after making cut 3 above on the second most energetic jets of the events, a cut on the difference in the azimuthal angle of the two most energetic jets will not be redundant, as we can see on the top panel of Fig. 3. This figure shows that indeed the main contribution to the background after cuts 1 to 3 have been applied is \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\). The bottom panel of Fig. 3, shows that we optimize the significance (Signal/\(\sqrt{{\rm B}ackground}\)) of the signal when we impose the following cut:

**Cut 4:** Only events for which \(|\varphi_{j_{1}}-\varphi_{j_{2}}|<2.6\) radians are kept.

Finally, because the emission of massive gravitons from our signal is expected to leave in general much more missing energy than the emission of neutrinos from vector boson decays, we consider the possibility of a cut on \(\hbox{$E$\kern-6.0pt\lower-0.43pt\hbox{/}}_{T}\). We see in Fig. 4 (left panel) that the distribution of this variable is clearly different for the signal and the background. On the right panel we show the significance of the signal as a function of an applied cut on the missing transverse energy and determine the optimum value of that cut. On the basis of this figure, we further require:

**Cut 5:** We keep only events for which \(\hbox{$E$\kern-6.0pt\lower-0.43pt\hbox{/}}_{T}>775\) GeV.

### Results

The above cuts leave us with only \(0.07\%\) (or \(1789\) events for an integrated luminosity \({\cal L}=100\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) of the initial number of background events, for the phase space region \(\hbox{$E$\kern-6.0pt\lower-0.43pt\hbox{/}}_{T,jet}>250\)) and \(14.4\%\) (or \(28210\) events) of the total number of signal events (\(M_{KK}=1.3\) TeV) for a significance of \(670\). It will therefore be easy to detect a pair of \(1.3\) TeV KK particles with the ATLAS detector. A \(5\sigma\) significance can be reached with a luminosity of only \(6\) pb\({}^{-1}\). Imposing the same cuts on the signal samples of different masses yields the curve of figure 5. With an integrated luminosity of \(100\) fb\({}^{-1}\), ATLAS will allow a \(5\sigma\) discovery if the mass of the first excited KK partons is \(<2685\) GeV (i.e. it is sensitive to a compactification radius of the extra dimension of \(\sim 2.7\) TeV\({}^{-1}\)).

We note also that such an high cut on missing transverse energy will help to discriminate with the principal large extra dimension signals ( one jet and missing energy) where only one of the gravitational modes (graviton or its superpartners) are produced.

A KK mass of 1.3 TeV is used as reference. Cuts 1-3 have been applied. bottom: Significance of the signal for different values of a cut on the difference in the azimuthal angle between the most energetic jets of an event.

## 4 Conclusions

In the present work we examined the phenomenology, at the LHC, of Universal Extra Dimensions (UED) models, where all the SM particles propagate in extra dimensions of the TeV\({}^{-1}\) size. Such models are theoretically interesting in that they provide a unification of the SM couplings at the weak scale. Because they require the conservation of momentum in the \(4+1\) dimensions, the KK states cannot be virtual and can only be produced in pair. This implies that these UED models are weakly constrained by previous electro-weak measurements. The models of present interest, motivated by cosmological reasons, also assume that the topology of these UED models form a thick brane embedded in a bulk of two large extra dimensions, allowing decay of the KK states produced in a collider.

mediated decay, i.e. into a graviton plus the zero-mode related to these KK states. The signature expected for such models is therefore a dijet plus a large amount of \(\not{\rm D}_{T}\). After computing, following [10], the cross sections for all the processes where a pair of the first excited KK states (n=1) of quark and gluon is produced in pp collisions, we produce a MC generator as an external PYTHIA routine for the simulation of such processes3. Considering the SM background for which the final state contains jets+\(\not{\rm D}_{T}\) we then find a set of experimental cuts that help to clean the signal and improve the background to signal ratio. With such an analysis we prove that if the mass of the compactification scale is higher than the actual experimental lower bound (\(M_{c}\ \raise 1.29pt\hbox{$>$\kern-7.5pt\lower 4.3pt\hbox{$\sim$}}\ 400\) GeV), we will be able to see this signal at more than \(5\sigma\) significance. For example, if \(M_{C}=1.3\) TeV we can probe these UED with only 6 pb\({}^{-1}\) luminosity, which is indeed a clear signal. We finally conclude that if there is one small extra dimension that can be universally probed by Standard Model particles and if the thin brane that it forms is embedded in a bulk of large extra dimensions as is predicted by Supersymmetric Large Extra Dimensions scenario [17, 18], then ATLAS will allow us to make a \(5\sigma\) discovery for such a signal for a compactification scale up to \(\sim 2700\) GeV.
