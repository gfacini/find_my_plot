**ATLAS interpretation of the combined measurements of coupling properties of the Higgs boson in terms of its production cross sections**

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The interpretation of the preliminary ATLAS combined measurements of coupling properties of the Higgs boson as production cross sections is presented. This combination uses the results for the decay channels \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to ZZ\to 4\ell\), \(H\to WW\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\), \(H\to b\overline{b}\), and \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\). These measurements are done assuming that the branching fractions of the Higgs boson are those expected in the Standard Model. The results obtained for the gluon fusion process for centre-of-mass energies of 8 TeV and 7 TeV, respectively, are \(\sigma^{\rm 8TeV}_{\rm ggF}=25.4^{+3.6}_{-3.5}\) (stat) \({}^{+2.9}_{-2.3}\) (syst) pb and \(\sigma^{\rm 7TeV}_{\rm ggF}=19.0~{}^{+6.2}_{-6.0}\) (stat) \({}^{+2.6}_{-1.9}\) (syst) pb. The result for the vector boson fusion process at 8 TeV is \(\sigma^{\rm 8\,TeV}_{\rm VBF}=2.6~{}\pm~{}0.6\) (stat) \({}^{+0.5}_{-0.4}\) (syst) pb. These measurements are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions.

At the LHC, only the product of the production cross section and branching fraction of a scattering process can be measured. Combined cross sections for Higgs boson production can be determined assuming that the branching fractions are those predicted by the Standard Model. For a Higgs boson mass of 125.5 GeV these are [1]: \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma=(0.22\pm 0.01)\%\), \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}=(2.8\pm 0.1)\%\), \(H\to WW^{(*)}=(22.3\pm 0.9)\%\), \(H\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}=(6.2\pm 0.35)\%\), and \(H\to b\overline{b}=(56.9\pm 1.9)\%\).

The combination of final states allows one to assess the QCD aspects of the Higgs production modes with the highest precision.

The decay channels used for this measurement are \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\)[2], \(H\to ZZ\to 4\ell\)[2], \(H\to WW\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu\)[2], \(H\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\)[3], \(H\to b\overline{b}\)[4]. Their analyses were optimized for sensitivity to different Higgs boson production modes. Only the two main production modes for which evidence was found (gluon fusion and the vector boson fusion) are considered here. The measurements are performed by combining the aforementioned channels using the statistical combination framework described in Ref. [5] for a fixed Higgs boson mass of 125.5 GeV. The contributions of the three associated production modes of a Higgs boson with, (i) a vector boson, (ii) a pair of top quarks and (iii) a \(b\)-quark, or pair of \(b\)-quarks, are taken into account in the combination. The process (i) is allowed to float in the fit while the small contributions from (ii) and (iii) are taken into account as fixed corrections set to their Standard Model expectations. All systematic uncertainties described in Ref. [5] are taken into account except that the theoretical uncertainties on the signal acceptance are neglected. For the VBF process, the measurement is performed for the 8 TeV data only, but the 7 TeV VBF cross section is also varied in the fit. The results obtained for the gluon fusion process are:

\[\sigma_{\rm ggF}\ (8\ {\rm TeV}) = 25.4^{+3.6}_{-3.5}\ ({\rm stat})\ \ ^{+2.9}_{-2.3}\ ({\rm syst})\ \ {\rm pb}\] \[\sigma_{\rm ggF}\ (7\ {\rm TeV}) = 19.0^{+6.2}_{-6.0}\ ({\rm stat})\ \ ^{+2.6}_{-1.9}\ ({\rm syst})\ \ {\rm pb}\]

These measurements are in agreement with the Standard Model predictions of \(19.1\pm 2.8\) pb at 8 TeV and \(15.0\pm 2.2\) pb at 7 TeV [1]. The measurement of the vector boson fusion production of the Higgs boson at 8 TeV yields:

\[\sigma_{\rm VBF}\ (8\ {\rm TeV})\ =\ 2.6\pm 0.6\ \ ({\rm stat})\ \ ^{+0.5}_{-0.4}\ ({\rm syst })\ \ {\rm pb}\]

in agreement with the Standard Model prediction of \(1.57^{+0.04}_{-0.05}\) pb at 8 TeV [1].
