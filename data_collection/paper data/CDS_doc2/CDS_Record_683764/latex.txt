###### Abstract

We describe direct measurements of the thermal conductivity of pyrolitic graphite (pg and tpg) proposed for removing heat from the Atlas SCT modules. For tpg the crucial conductivity (parallel to the lamina plane) is in excess of 1700W/m-K at room temperature with an appreciable negative temperature coefficient and is radiation hard. Measurements of the conductivity perpendicular to the lamina plane suggest that a thin polyimide coating, if required, would not seriously affect its performance.

## 1 Introduction

Forms of pyrolitic graphite (pg), which combine the properties of low mass and high thermal conductivity, are being extensively investigated as a means of removing heat from the SCT detector wafers and associated front-end electronics [1, 2, 3]. Such substrates have a laminar structure and hence highly anisotropic properties. In principle, material with nearly perfect crystal structure can be made. Data for this can be found in the literature [4]. The thermal conductivity in the lamina plane, \(K_{ab}\), is a maximum (\(\sim 5000W\)/m-K) near 100K and falls smoothly to \(\sim 1950W\)/m-K at room temperature. \(K_{c}\), perpendicular to the lamina plane, is smaller by more than two orders of magnitude, being \(\sim 6W\)/m-K at room temperature. In practice, the performance of commercially available pyrolitic graphite, which concerns us here, depends strongly on the degree of regularity of the crystal structure and is a function of the production process.

The highest commercial grade, thermal pyrolytic graphite (tpg) has a conductivity approaching the values quoted above. It is mechanically poor, with low strength perpendicular to the lamina plane and an easily damaged surface. However, in the form of a thin sheet (with thickness in the c direction), sandwiched between the silicon wafers of an SCT module, it offers a very efficient means of reducing the temperature of hot-spots and conducting heat to the external cooling pipe.

A thermally lower grade material, referred to as simply "pyrolitic graphite (pg)", has only a fraction of the thermal performance of tpg: \(K_{ab}\sim 300-400\)W/m-K, but is mechanically stronger and can be machined. Material with intermediate properties has been produced, for instance 1300W/m-K pg was used in an SCT thermal prototype [1].

Details of the fabrication of pyrolitic graphite are not widely published and there is some uncertainty in its performance. Hence it is important to make independent measurements both at the design stage (to assess performance) and during SCT module production (for quality control). Although advanced pulse techniques exist, we have made relatively straightforward, steady-state measurements. The samples examined were usually thin (0.3-0.5mm), as required by the SCT material budget. Except where otherwise stated they were purchased from ACC[5].

## 2 Measurement of in-plane Conductivity, \(K_{ab}\)

### Apparatus

The heat conducted by a bar of uniform cross section A and length L, with temperature difference \(\Delta T\) between its ends, is given by:

\[W=K.A.\Delta T/L \tag{1}\]

where \(K\) is the thermal conductivity of the material. The principle of our measurement is shown in Fig. 1. The sample is clamped at one end to a thick film resistor, which dissipates a measured electrical power W, and at the other end to a heat sink. Four thermistors are distributed along its length to determine the temperature gradient, which should be constant in the region of unidirectional heat flow (sufficiently far from the ends).

For the measurement of thin samples considerable error can arise due to heat lost or gained through the surface. Initially we measured a 0.3mm thick Copper foil (\(K\sim 400\)W/m-K) which has a thermal conductance at the low end of the range of interest, where these surface effects are most important. With no insulation around the sample, its temperature was found to fluctuate erratically due to convection caused by ambient drafts. This was eliminated by insulating the sample with polystyrene foam. Subsequently the temperature distribution was stable but far from linear, and was reproduced in vacuum, indicating that a fraction of the conducted heat was lost by thermal radiation. Application of Stefan's law shows that for such a long, thin sample the correction for radiation is of the same order as the injected power W. 1 Hence the simple arrangement of Fig.1(a) is inadequate for our sample dimensions.

Footnote 1: For a foil of thickness t, \(\Delta T^{\prime}\) above ambient, the ratio of radiated to conducted heat (close to 300K and assuming unit emissivity) is given approximately by \(12L^{2}.(\Delta T^{\prime}/\Delta T)/(K.t)\). For L=0.1m, \(K\)=400W/m-K, t=0.3mm and \(\Delta T^{\prime}\sim\Delta T\) this is equal to 1.

In order to minimise such surface effects we constructed the apparatus shown in Fig.1(b), in which the sample is enclosed by an aluminium box of uniform wall thickness, which acts as a thermal guard. At one end the sample and guard are Figure 1: Measurement of the in-plane conductivity (a) principle of the measurement (b) the thermally guarded apparatus (with outer insulation removed and lid raised)

clamped together and to a heat sink. At the other end they are independently heated. The system is adjusted until the guard temperature matches that of the sample, minimising the temperature gradient orthogonal to its surface.

The sample was supported within the guard box by foam insulation. It was heated by a thick film resistor element clamped to its surface and connected by thin stainless steel leads to minimise conductive loss (these dissipated \(\sim\)0.8 % of the electrical power). The guard box was heated by four resistors attached to its end and was loosely insulated against convection. Power to both sets of resistors was adjusted manually.

Four insulating feedthroughs were fixed into the lid of the guard box. Each carried a thermistor, glued into a cylindrical brass tip which allowed measurement of the sample temperature at an accurately known position. The feedthroughs were spring-loaded to make contact with the sample, which is otherwise difficult in the case of tpg. With this arrangement the sample could be changed quickly whilst retaining a fixed set of thermistors. The guard temperature was measured at a point near the heated end by a thermistor embedded in its surface. The thermistors were selected 'R-T curve-matched' [6] whose relative equalisation was maintained within 0.02\({}^{\circ}\) over a 10\({}^{\circ}\) range. They were monitored by a Keithley 2001 scanner, controlled by a Labview program which also displayed the temperatures and the degree of balance between sample and guard. The heat sink was a large block of aluminium, which was cooled by either air (ambient or fanned), a Peltier stage or melting ice. The time to adjust the system to a steady, balanced state was typically half an hour.

Measurements were made with temperature differences of typically 2\({}^{\circ}\)-3\({}^{\circ}\) between adjacent thermistors, corresponding to dissipated power in the range 0.2-2W. Mean sample temperatures were in the range \(10^{\circ}-40^{\circ}\)C. At the extremes of this range there was a slight departure from linearity at one end of the sample, which dominates our estimated error of \(\pm 5\%\) in the value of \(K\) for low conductance samples. This effect is proportionately less for higher conductance samples, and for tpg the major source of error is the uncertainty in the sample thickness. The low conductance copper test sample was periodically measured, resulting in values for its conductivity in the range 385-420W/m-K.

### Results for tpg

We measured samples of tpg with a cross-section of \(\sim\)0.4mm \(\times\) 10mm, at a power of typically 1W. The corresponding thermal flux density is well above the worst case expected in the SCT module baseplate.

In figure 2 we show results for samples obtained from two manufacturers [5, 7]. Despite differing macroscopic surface structure, their in-plane thermal performance is very similar, and displays the negative temperature coefficient characteristic of the highly regular form of this material. A further sample was uniformly irradiated in the PS test beam to a fluence of \(3\times 10^{14}\,\mathrm{protons}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\). Its subsequent performance is identical within the uncertainty (\(\sim\pm 3.5\%\)) in our measurement.

Two features relevant to the performance of tpg emerged during the course of these measurements. Firstly, in order to achieve reproducible results it was Figure 2: Results for the in-plane conductivity of 0.4mm thick tpg samples as supplied by ACC (fitted data) and ATOMGRAPH. Also shown are results for a second ACC sample irradiated to \(3\times 10^{14}\)protons/cm\({}^{2}\).

essential to coat the ends of the sample with thermal grease. This may be due either to the microscopic structure of the contact, or to the visible unevenness of the tpg surface. Secondly, a sample which was broken in two and then repaired (with a barely visible glue joint) displayed a drastic loss of conductance. We note that a 1\(\mu\)m long air gap in the heat path has a thermal resistance similar to a 7cm length of tpg. Hence, in order to benefit from the high thermal conductivity of this material, breaks in the thermal path such as a poor external contact or material fracture should be avoided. By contrast, we measured repeatedly a sample which had been merely bent (resulting in a visible wrinkle due to de-lamination) but which retained its high in-plane conductivity. Fig. 3 shows a temperature-distance plot for this sample, from which it is clear that there is no appreciable discontinuity in its conductivity within the 45mm length over which the temperature was measured.

### Results for pg

Fig. 4 shows measurements of a sample of pyrolitic graphite purchased from ACC. This has a mean conductivity of 352W/m-K (\(\sim\) 10% below that of copper) and negligible temperature coefficient. It should be noted that this material has been previously referred to as 'PG 700', implying a higher conductivity (the lower value is now well established). Confusion regarding the performance of this lower grade material however emphasises the necessity to continue with such measurements.

## 3 Transverse Thermal Conductivity

For efficient heat removal along a sheet of tpg all of its thickness must contribute to the conduction, i.e. its transverse resistance must be small compared to its longitudinal resistance. For a rectangular sheet of length L and thickness t this is expressed by:

\[K_{c}/K_{ab}\gg(t/L)^{2} \tag{2}\]

For nominal values of the conductivities of tpg and for SCT dimensions (t=0.4mm, L\(\sim\)6cm ) this condition is satisfied by two orders of magnitude. In reality however the geometry of the SCT module is more complicated: it has a profiled tpg baseplate, with localised areas of thermal contact, and non-uniform heat generation. Consequently, the transverse resistivity cannot be trivially neglected, and detailed thermal models and a reliable knowledge of \(K_{c}\) are required. A similar concern is the effect of coating the surface of the tpg with a thin layer of polyimide [8]. We therefore measured conduction through the thickness of both bare and polyimide-coated tpg.

We used the arrangement shown in Fig. 5, in which the sample was clamped very tightly between two blocks of copper (to minimise the contact resistance at its top and bottom surfaces) and temperature was measured by a thermistor embedded in the face of each block.

Figure 5: Arrangement used to measure the transverse conductivity (not to scale). Sample dimensions were 0.4–2.0mm thick \(\times\sim\)150mm\({}^{2}\). Thermistors were \(<\)1mm in diameter, embedded in 5mm thick copper blocks.

Owing to the high in-plane conductivity, a small misalignment of the lamina plane with respect to the sample surface tends to increase the transverse conductance. We found by cleaving and measuring samples that the degree of misalignment was typically a few milliradians, and below we have used 10mr in estimating a lower bound for \(K_{c}\). 2.

Footnote 2: All laminae which intersect the copper surfaces were assumed to be thermally short-circuited, reducing the effective sample thickness by \(\sim 0.1\)m m

### \(K_{c}\) of tpg

Samples of tpg were measured with a thermal flux in the range 10-50mW/mm\({}^{2}\). We measured first a sample of module baseplate material of thickness \(\sim\)0.4mm. Since the copper-tpg contact resistance could introduce a large additional temperature drop into our measurement we also measured a thicker (2mm) sample: this was re-measured after polishing down to 1.8mm, and finally after cleaving to a thickness of 0.95mm.

The measured temperature difference for fixed mean sample temperature was proportional to the heater power. Over the range of sample temperatures 20\({}^{\circ}\)C-50\({}^{\circ}\)C we observed a reduction in conductance of \(\sim 0.3\) % per degree, consistent with the behaviour of \(K_{c}\) given in [4]. In Fig. 6 we plot data taken close to 30\({}^{\circ}\)C. Measurements made with thermal grease between the copper and tpg exhibit good linearity, with a small intercept which indicates that the contribution from contact resistance is small. The transverse conductivity (found from the inverse of the slope, and allowing for the uncertainty in alignment) is \(8.4^{+0.3}_{-0.6}\)W/m-K. For comparison the upper dashed line in fig.6 is drawn with a slope corresponding to \(K_{c}\)=6W/m-K, the value expected for very highly oriented pyrolitic graphite. The lower line corresponds to 25W/m-K, a value which is quoted in the literature but is considerably higher than our result.

### \(K_{c}\) of pg

The above procedure was followed for pg samples, of thickness 0.5mm and 1.8mm. In this case we found \(K_{c}\)=\(2.3^{+0.1}_{-0.2}\) W/m-K.

### Transverse conductivity of polyimide-encapsulated tpg

For use within a module it is proposed to encapsulate the tpg baseplate with polyimide of thickness \(\sim\)20\(\mu\)m [8]. Polyimides can have a low thermal conductivity (of order 0.2W/m-K) so that such a layer would contribute a transverse thermal resistance very much higher than the tpg substrate. To minimise such effects a high quality encapsulation process has been developed [8].

In a typical measurement, a thermal flux of \(\sim\)13mW/mm\({}^{2}\) through 0.4mm thick coated tpg produced a temperature difference across the sample of 4.1\({}^{\circ}\)C. From this we subtracted the tpg contribution of 0.6\({}^{\circ}\)C, estimated using the value of \(K_{c}\) measured above. Following the measurement the polyimide layers were peeled from the substrate and their thickness measured by viewing edge-on on a probe station stage. Mean values for the two faces were 23.0\(\mu\)m and 27.6\(\mu\)m,Figure 6: Transverse resistivity vs tpg thickness (at 30\({}^{\circ}\)C).

with variations of \(\pm 5\mu\)m. The inferred value for the conductivity of polyimide (allowing for the uncertainties in \(K_{c}\) and thickness) was \(0.19(\pm.04)\)W/m-K. This is consistent with the expected value, indicating that there are no large unforeseen effects due to contact resistance or to the coating method. We found negligible variation in conductivity with temperature over the range 6 - 26\({}^{\circ}\)C.

## 4 Summary

We have measured the thermal conductivity of samples of tpg and pg, of similar dimensions to those used in the SCT modules, using a straightforward static method.

The results of the measurements are summarised as follows:

* The in-plane conductivity of tpg is 1720 (\(\pm 3.5\%\))W/m-K at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C, with a temperature coefficient of \(\sim\) -8W/m-K\({}^{2}\). Similar results were obtained for a sample irradiated to \(3\times 10^{14}\) protons/cm\({}^{2}\).
* The transverse conductivity of tpg is \(8.4(^{+0.3}_{-0.6})\)W/m-K at 30\({}^{\circ}\)C, with a temperature coefficient of \(\sim\) -0.03W/m-K\({}^{2}\).
* The ACC pyrolitic graphite has an in-plane thermal conductivity of 352 (\(\pm 5\%\))W/m-K, with temperature dependence \(<0.3\)W/m-K\({}^{2}\). For the transverse conductivity we measure \(2.3(^{+0.1}_{-0.2})\)W/m-K.
* The conductivity of a 25\(\mu\)m layer of encapsulating polyimide was measured to be consistent with its expected value.

We should stress that the transverse resistance of the tpg baseplate, even when encapsulated with polyimide, does not appear to be critical: in the case of uniform detector power dissipation of 100\(\mu\)W/mm\({}^{2}\) the increase in surface temperature should be \(<0.003^{\circ}\)C due to the tpg, and \(\sim\)0.01\({}^{\circ}\)C due to the polyimide. These are small effects compared to the temperature increase across the silicon surface and the contact to the module cooling pipe, as measured in [1, 3].

We remark that some of the problems encountered in our measurements have a natural counterpart in the thermal performance of the module: for instance thermal radiation and convection are expected to contribute at an appreciable level [1, 3]. Misalignment of the tpg lamina axis, which is a limitation in our transverse measurement, should have only a beneficial effect on the thermal performance of a module. Finally, reasonable care should be taken in handling bare tpg, since a fracture can result in a catastrophic loss of conduction.
