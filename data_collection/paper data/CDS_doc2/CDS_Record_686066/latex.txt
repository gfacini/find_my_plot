###### Abstract

Resolution properties of the ATLAS muon spectrometer are investigated in the limit of very high muon energies, where multiple scattering effects are small and where the momentum resolution is determined mostly by the intrinsic detector resolution, the number of detector monolayers, and the chamber layout. It is shown that the present baseline design provides for a momentum resolution which is close to the optimum that can be achieved with a given total number of monolayers, to within 20% for the barrel and 10% for the end-cap and transition regions.

ATLAS Internal Note

## 1 Introduction

At sufficiently high particle energies, the momentum resolution of an open geometry magnetic spectrometer such as the ATLAS muon spectrometer is limited only by detector resolution. In the ATLAS muon toroids, the effects of stochastic energy losses and multiple scattering become small, and the momentum resolution detector limited, for energies above a few hundred GeV [1, 2]. In this regime, the spectrometer resolution profits from a careful optimization of detector resolution and geometry.

This note addresses the problem of computing approximate analytic expressions for the momentum resolution of the ATLAS muon spectrometer in the high-energy limit. These formulas have the advantage of making the resolution properties of the spectrometer transparent, and provide a kit of simple tools for optimizing geometry and layout of the muon chambers in the high energy limit. At smaller muon momenta, multiple scattering and energy losses dilute the results of this study but do not affect the conclusions in any major way.

We also ignore in this note the problem of chamber misalignment because all results refer to individual towers, at which level chamber misalignments cause biases in the momentumdetermination but do not affect the resolution. Of course, such biases effectively degrade the spectrometer resolution when averaged over many towers.

Considering detector resolution only has the advantage that all relevant calculations can be done analytically and do not require Monte Carlo simulations1. In practice, some of the calculations turn out to be complex. The Mathematica program [3] was used to obtain most of the results of this note; they are therefore believed to be reliable, although the responsibility for any mistakes rests entirely with the author.

Footnote 1: The method used here can be generalised to also treat multiple scattering and energy loss provided the topology of the spectrometer is not overly complex. For the ATLAS spectrometer, and in particular for the barrel, this is likely to be a difficult task.

Of course, the computations presented here cannot, and do not pretend to, compete with the accuracy of full-fledged, detailed Monte Carlo simulations [2].

## 2 Detector Resolution and Momentum Resolution in Magnetic Spectrometers

The algorithm employed here to compute the momentum resolution of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is a byproduct of a general and powerful algorithm for the momentum reconstruction of charged particles in magnetic spectrometers, with an optimal statistical treatment of all physical effects that determine the momentum resolution (detector resolution, multiple scattering, and energy loss). This algorithm was originally developed for the NA4 muon scattering experiment at the CERN SPS and is documented in detail in Refs. [4, 5]. The present chapter is an abridged and simplified digest of these two papers. It summarises the key ingredients of the method to the extent that they are relevant for the present discussion, and is included here mostly for pedagogical reasons; the reader who is interested in the results only may skip directly to the next chapter.

### The model for the muon track

The model starts off from the equation of motion of a particle in a magnetic field,

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}=\mathit{e}(\vec{v}\times\vec{B})- \mathit{f}(\mathit{p})\vec{v}, \tag{1}\]

where \(\vec{p}\) is the momentum of the particle, \(\vec{B}\) the magnetic field, \(\mathit{e}\) is the electric charge of the particle, and \(\vec{v}\) is a unit vector in the momenta particle direction. The function \(\mathit{f}(\mathit{p})\), where \(\mathit{p}=|\vec{p}|\), is the energy loss of the particle (often written \(\mathrm{d}E/\mathrm{d}x\)) which is treated here as a continuous average energy loss, i.e. ignoring statistical fluctuations. This can be solved by two equations for the track in space which in cartesian coordinates read

\[x(z) = x_{1}+\mathit{a}z+\frac{X(z)}{p_{1}} \tag{2}\] \[y(z) = y_{1}+\mathit{b}z+\frac{Y(z)}{p_{1}}, \tag{3}\]where \(p_{1}\) is the particle momentum at a point \((x_{1},y_{1},\,z_{1})-\) typically chosen as the point where the track enters the spectrometer - and \(X(z)\) and \(Y(z)\) are given by

\[X(z) = e\int_{z_{1}}^{z}\int_{z_{1}}^{u}\frac{F(v)\,\mathrm{d}v\,\mathrm{ d}u}{1-\frac{1}{p_{1}}\int f(p)\,\mathrm{d}s} \tag{4}\] \[Y(z) = e\int_{z_{1}}^{z}\int_{z_{1}}^{u}\frac{G(v)\,\mathrm{d}v\, \mathrm{d}u}{1-\frac{1}{p_{1}}\int f(p)\,\mathrm{d}s}, \tag{5}\]

where \(\int f(p)\,\mathrm{d}s\) is a line integral over the energy loss along the muon track between the points \((x_{1},y_{1},\,z_{1})\) and \((x,y,\,z)\).2 The constants \(a\) and \(b\) have the physical meaning of first derivatives ("initial slopes") of the track at \(z=z_{1}\). The functions \(F\) and \(G\) are given by

Footnote 2: For the special case of no energy loss, \(\int f(p)\mathrm{d}s=0\), these equations were first derived by H. Wind in the framework of the “quintic spline model” of charged particle tracks in magnetic spectrometers [6].

\[F(x^{\prime},y^{\prime},B_{x},B_{y},B_{z}) = \sqrt{1+x^{\prime}+y^{\prime}}[y^{\prime}B_{z}-(1+x^{\prime 2})B_{y }+x^{\prime}y^{\prime}B_{x}] \tag{6}\] \[G(x^{\prime},y^{\prime},B_{x},B_{y},B_{z}) = \sqrt{1+x^{\prime}+y^{\prime}}[-x^{\prime}B_{z}-(1+y^{\prime 2})B_{x }+x^{\prime}y^{\prime}B_{y}], \tag{7}\]

where \(x^{\prime}=\,\mathrm{d}x/\mathrm{d}z\) etc and \((B_{x},B_{y},B_{z})\) is the magnetic field.

### Momentum fit and momentum error

A "traditional" method of estimating the momentum consists in a \(\chi^{2}\) fit of Equs. (2) and (3) to the measured track coordinates which gives a simultaneous determination of the five parameters \(x_{1},\ y_{1},\ a,\ b\) and \(k=1/p_{1}\)[6]. A more elegant method [4, 5], in particular with a view to the error estimates, is to separate the fit of \(k\) from the fit of the geometrical parameters. This is achieved by introducing so-called pseudoslopes \(s_{i}\), \(t_{i}\) and pseudocurvatures \(\alpha_{i}\), \(\beta_{i}\) which are constructed in a straightforward way from successive sets of two and three coordinate measurements, respectively, in each projection:

\[s_{i} = \frac{x_{i+1}-x_{i}}{z_{i+1}-z_{i}} \tag{8}\] \[t_{i} = \frac{y_{i+1}-y_{i}}{z_{i+1}-z_{i}} \tag{9}\]

and

\[\alpha_{i} = s_{i+1}-s_{i} \tag{10}\] \[\beta_{i} = t_{i+1}-t_{i} \tag{11}\]

Inserting Equs. (2) and (3) yields the following predictions for the pseudocurvatures:

\[\alpha_{i}^{p} = kA_{i}\,\equiv k\Big{[}\frac{X(\,z_{i+2})-X(\,z_{i+1})}{z_{i+2}- z_{i+1}}-\frac{X(\,z_{i+1})-X(\,z_{i})}{z_{i+1}-z_{i}}\Big{]} \tag{12}\] \[\beta_{i}^{p} = kB_{i}\,\equiv k\Big{[}\frac{Y(z_{i+2})-Y(z_{i+1})}{z_{i+2}-z_{i+ 1}}-\frac{Y(\,z_{i+1})-Y(z_{i})}{z_{i+1}-z_{i}}\Big{]}. \tag{13}\]The \(\chi^{2}\) for the comparison of measured and predicted pseudocurvatures reads

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{x}-2}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{x}-2}(\alpha_{i}-k\,A_{i})(E^{-1})_{ ij}(\alpha_{j}-kA_{j})+\sum_{k=1}^{N_{y}-2}\sum_{l=1}^{N_{y}-2}(\beta_{k}-k\,B_{k})(E^{-1} )_{kl}(\beta_{l}-kB_{l}) \tag{14}\]

where \(N_{x}\) and \(N_{y}\) are the numbers of measured coordinates in the \(x\) and \(y\) projections, respectively, and \((E^{-1})_{ij}\)and \((E^{-1})_{kl}\) are the covariance matrices of the pseudocurvatures in the same projections, _i.e._ the inverse of the error matrices for the pseudocurvatures \(E(\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j})\) which are discussed in Appendix A. Minimisation \(\mathrm{d}\chi^{2}/\mathrm{d}k=0\) gives

\[k=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N_{x}-2}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{x}-2}(E^{-1})_{ij}A_{i}\,\alpha_{j} +\sum_{k=1}^{N_{y}-2}\sum_{l=1}^{N_{y}-2}(E^{-1})_{kl}B_{k}\beta_{l}}{\sum_{i= 1}^{N_{x}-2}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{x}-2}(E^{-1})_{ij}A_{i}A_{j}+\sum_{k=1}^{N_{y}-2} \sum_{l=1}^{N_{y}-2}(E^{-1})_{kl}B_{k}B_{l}}. \tag{15}\]

Although this may look complicated at first sight, it represents a very fast method of momentum determination since it does not require numerical minimisation and, as long as the energy loss term \(\int f(p)\mathrm{d}s\) in Equs. (4) and (5) can be neglected, does also not require any iterations. The momentum fit proper is, however, not discussed any further in the present paper.

Standard statistical techniques give the estimated variance of \(k\) which is

\[(\Delta k)^{2}=\Big{[}\sum_{i=1}^{N_{x}-2}\sum_{j=1}^{N_{x}-2}(E^{-1})_{ij}A_ {i}A_{j}+\sum_{k=1}^{N_{y}-2}\sum_{l=1}^{N_{y}-2}(E^{-1})_{kl}B_{k}B_{l}\Big{]} ^{-1}. \tag{16}\]

This is the master equation for all further calculations in this note. It describes the momentum resolution of any magnetic spectrometer in full generality; multiple scattering and energy loss effects are neglected here by omitting the corresponding terms from the error matrix \(E_{ij}\). Finally, remember that

\[\frac{\Delta p}{p}=\frac{\Delta k}{k}=p\Delta k. \tag{17}\]

In practice, Equ. (16) can usually be cast into a much more transparent expression. For high momentum tracks with small curvature, one can always find a coordinate system3 where \(x^{\prime}\approx 0\) and \(y^{\prime}\approx 0\), such that Equs. (6) and (7) simplify to a very good approximation to

Footnote 3: Of course, this coordinate system does, in general, not coincide with the canonical ATLAS coordinate system. For simplicity, we do not change notation each time we make a coordinate transformation.

\[F \simeq -B_{y} \tag{18}\] \[G \simeq B_{x}. \tag{19}\]

Finally, when the magnetic bending is measured in only one plane we can take \(B\equiv B_{y}\) to be the field component orthogonal to the measurement plane and set

\[G=B_{x}=0; \tag{20}\]

in other words, \(B_{i}=0\) for all \(i\) in Equ. (13).

Layout optimisation in the three-chamber approximation

### Momentum resolution from three-point measurements

In this Section, we approximate the measurement of a track in a given chamber by the measurement of a single coordinate, such that the track is measured in only \(N_{x}=3\) points; \(N_{y}\) is now irrelevant because of assumption (20). Equation (16) then simplifies to

\[\frac{\Delta p}{p}=\frac{p\sqrt{E}}{A}, \tag{21}\]

where we have written \(E\equiv(E^{-1})_{11}^{-1}\) and \(A\equiv A_{1}\). For a given geometrical arrangement of chambers, the error matrix element \(E\) contains all information on the detector resolution and \(A\) all information on the magnetic field.

When the track is measured at \(z_{1}\), \(z_{2}\) and \(z_{3}\) with resolutions \(\sigma_{1}\), \(\sigma_{2}\) and \(\sigma_{3}\), we find from Equ. (42) of Appendix A

\[E=\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2}^{2}}{(z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}}+\frac{2\sigma_{2}^{2 }}{(z_{2}-z_{1})(z_{3}-z_{2})}+\frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}+\sigma_{3}^{2}}{(z_{3}-z_{ 2})^{2}}. \tag{22}\]

The chamber resolution \(\sigma_{i}\) depends on the intrinsic MDT resolution \(\sigma_{0}\), the number of MDT monolayers per chamber \(N_{i}\) and a "systems resolution" \(\sigma_{s}\),

\[\sigma_{i}^{2}=\sigma_{s}^{2}+\frac{\sigma_{0}^{2}}{N_{i}}. \tag{23}\]

The term \(\sigma_{s}\) describes all effects of mechanical imperfections inside a chamber, and is assumed to be equal for all chambers.

### Optimal multilayer configurations

To minimise \(E\) as expressed by Equs. (22) and (23), we assume a fixed total number of monolayers \(N_{t}=N_{1}+N_{2}+N_{3}\) and replace \(N_{1}\) and \(N_{2}\) by real variables \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\). Differentiating \(E\) with respect to \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) gives

\[\frac{\partial E}{\partial v_{1}} = \frac{\sigma_{0}^{2}}{\sigma_{s}^{2}}\Big{[}\frac{1}{(z_{3}-z_{2} )^{2}(\,N_{t}-v_{1}-v_{2})^{2}}-\frac{1}{(\,z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}v_{1}^{2}}\Big{]} \tag{24}\] \[\frac{\partial E}{\partial v_{2}} = \frac{\sigma_{0}^{2}}{\sigma_{s}^{2}}\Big{[}\frac{1}{(z_{3}-z_{2} )^{2}(\,N_{t}-v_{1}-v_{2})^{2}}\] (25) \[-\frac{1}{v_{2}^{2}}\Big{(}\frac{1}{(z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}}+\frac{1}{ (z_{3}-z_{2})^{2}}+\frac{2}{(\,z_{2}-z_{1})(z_{3}-z_{2})}\Big{)}\Big{]}.\]

Solving this system for \(\partial E/\partial v_{1}=0\) and \(\partial E/\partial v_{2}=0\) gives the following "physical" solution which satisfies \(v_{1}>0\), \(v_{2}>0\) and \(v_{1}+v_{2}<N_{t}\):

\[v_{1} = \frac{z_{3}-z_{2}}{z_{3}-z_{1}}\frac{N_{t}}{2} \tag{26}\] \[v_{2} = \frac{N_{t}}{2}, \tag{27}\]i.e. one half of the total number of monolayers should always be used in the middle chamber, independent of the position of this chamber and of the field topology. The same result was found, with a different technique, in Ref. [2]. In the ATLAS muon spectrometer, \((z_{3}-z_{2})/(z_{3}-z_{1})\approx\frac{1}{2}\) for both end-cap and barrel. Under the condition that every chamber should consist of at least 6 monolayers, a "minimal" configuration to obtain an optimum momentum resolution would consist of \(N_{1}=6\), \(N_{2}=12\), and \(N_{3}=6\) monolayers, _i.e._ a total of \(N_{t}=24\) monolayers. This scenario will be referred to henceforth as the "optimum" monolayer configuration. We will see below how different configurations affect the resolution obtained with this layout.

#### 3.2.1 End-cap region

We do not need to know the magnetic field in order to compare momentum resolutions for different configurations of detector resolution as long as we do not vary the chamber positions \(z_{1}\), \(z_{2}\), and \(z_{3}\). If we label two such configurations \(a\) and \(b\), then from Equ. (21):

\[\Big{(}\frac{\Delta p}{p}\Big{)}_{a}\Big{/}\Big{(}\frac{\Delta p}{p}\Big{)}_{b }=\sqrt{\frac{E_{a}}{E_{b}}}. \tag{28}\]

For numerical results, we assume the chamber layout shown in Fig. 1 which is discussed in detail in Ref. [1]. From this figure, we find the following approximate positions \(z_{i}^{b}\) along the beam direction:

\[z_{1}^{b}=7.2\;\mathrm{m},\quad z_{2}^{b}=13.6\;\mathrm{m},\quad z_{3}^{b}=21. 3\;\mathrm{m}, \tag{29}\]

where the average of the two \(z\) positions has been used for the third plane. Ratios of momentum resolutions from Equ. (28) apply to all polar angles \(\theta\) in the end-cap region since all distances \(z_{i}-z_{j}\) scale with a common factor \(1/\cos\theta\); the resolution itself does, of course, depend on \(\theta\).

For the MDT resolution, we refer to Table 4.6 of Ref. [1] from which we find

\[\sigma_{0}=60\ \mu\mathrm{m},\quad\sigma_{s}=20\ \mu\mathrm{m}. \tag{30}\]

Results are shown in Table 1 where momentum resolutions for "nearly-optimal" multi-layer configurations are compared to the present baseline designs with an equal number of 6 or 8 MDT monolayers in each chamber, respectively (configurations 1 and 5 of Table 1). For a given total number of monolayers \(N_{t}\), a "nearly-optimal" multilayer configuration is simply computed by rounding \(v_{1}\), \(v_{2}\) from Equs. (26) and (27) to the nearest even integers \(N_{1}\) and \(N_{2}\), assuming that we do not want to construct chambers with an odd number of monolayers; of course, \(N_{3}=N_{t}-N_{1}-N_{2}\). In some cases, similar combinations of monolayers are also shown when they give similar resolutions.

For completeness, we give an example of an explicit expression for \(\Delta p/p\) which is easily computed from Equs. (12), (21), and (22) if we can make analytical approximations to the functional dependence of \(B(z)\). For the most simple model where \(B=\mathit{const}\) for \(z_{1}\leq z\leq z_{2}\) and \(B=0\) for all other \(z\),

\[A=\frac{1}{2}eB(z_{2}-z_{1}) \tag{31}\]\[\frac{\Delta p}{p}=\frac{2p}{eB(z_{2}-z_{1})}\sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{1}^{2}+\sigma_{2} ^{2}}{(z_{2}-z_{1})^{2}}+\frac{2\sigma_{2}^{2}}{(z_{2}-z_{1})(z_{3}-z_{2})}+ \frac{\sigma_{2}^{2}+\sigma_{3}^{2}}{(z_{3}-z_{2})^{2}}}. \tag{32}\]

The computation of more realistic expressions based on more detailed parametrisations of \(B\) is, in general, straightforward. Of course, this formalism can also be used for numerical estimates of the momentum resolution based on complete, three-dimensional field maps.

#### 3.2.2 Transition region

Momentum resolutions in the transition region \(1.05<|\eta|<1.4\) (cf. Fig. 1) can be compared in the same way, provided the small horizontal chambers near \(z^{b}=10\) m, \(|\eta|=1.4\) are neglected. The results are very similar to those for the end-cap region and are not reproduced here. No attempt is made to give an analytic approximation to the momentum resolution in this region; although this does not represent a particular mathematical difficulty, it would probably be of limited usefulness due to the strong fringe field effects in this region.

#### 3.2.3 Barrel

The same technique as for the end-cap region can also be applied to the barrel; remember that Equs. (22) and (28) are independent of the magnetic field topology. We assume the same chamber resolutions as for the end-cap region and radial chamber positions

\[r_{1}=4.9\,\mathrm{m},\quad r_{2}=7.3\,\mathrm{m},\quad r_{3}=10.7\,\mathrm{m}; \tag{33}\]

of course, the same scaling considerations apply as to the end-cap region. Numerical results are given in Table 1. As expected, they are also very similar to those for the end-cap since

Figure 1: _Top view of the muon chamber chamber layout (from Ref. [1])._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

In the barrel spectrometer, there is some freedom to adjust the position \(r_{2}\) of the middle chambers and this expression can be used to find the position that gives an optimum momentum resolution. Figure 2 shows \(\Delta p/p\) as a function of \(r_{2}\). This curve has a minimum at \(r_{2}^{opt}=7.65\) m,4 to be compared to the present baseline position \(r_{2}=7.3\) m. However, the minimum is flat in the neighborhood of \(r_{2}^{opt}\) and the relative change of \(\Delta p/p\) between \(r_{2}=7.3\) m and \(r_{2}=7.65\) m is smaller than 2%.

Footnote 4: This is a numerical result; the minimisation \(\partial(\Delta p/p)/\partial r_{2}=0\) does not have an analytic solution.

## 4 Effects of the Multilayer Spacing

To study the effects of multilayer spacing, the track measurement is treated as a measurement of six points per track. For simple field topologies, applying the formalism of Section 2 to this case is straightforward, involving the inversion of a \(4\times 4\) error matrix as only additional complication. The resulting explicit forms of Equ. (16) are, in general, lengthy and non-transparent; in our case, they easily span more than one page. They are not reproduced here and we limit the discussion to a few numerical results.

### End-cap region

The end-cap region is modeled as a measurement in 6 planes at positions \(z_{1}^{b},\ldots,z_{6}^{b}\) along the beam direction. The value of \(z_{1}^{b}\) is fixed to the position of the first multilayer and \(z_{6}^{b}\) to

Figure 2: _Momentum resolution in the barrel as a function of the position of the middle chambers_

that of the last multilayer; in addition, we fix the position \(z_{m}^{b}\) of the median plane of the second chamber, _i.e._ the average of \(z_{3}^{b}\) and \(z_{4}^{b}\):

\[z_{1}^{b}=6.9\;\mathrm{m},\quad z_{m}^{b}=1\,3.6\,\mathrm{m},\quad z_{6}^{b}=21.5\,\mathrm{m}. \tag{35}\]

The positions \(z_{2}^{b}\), \(z_{3}^{b}\), \(z_{4}^{b}\) and \(z_{5}^{b}\) are varied introducing the multilayer spacing \(d\) which is the same for all chambers:

\[z_{2}^{b} =z_{1}^{b}+d z_{3}^{b}=z_{m}^{b}-\frac{d}{2}\] \[z_{4}^{b} =z_{m}^{b}+\frac{d}{2} z_{5}^{b}=z_{6}^{b}-d \tag{36}\]

The chamber resolution is assumed to be the same in all multilayers. The magnetic field is applied between \(z_{2}\) and \(z_{3}\) and is assumed to be constant along the track. It is scaled according to \(B=C/(z_{3}-z_{2})\), such that \(\int B\mathrm{d}l=C=const\) in dependent of \(d\); in other words, the dimensions of the end-cap magnet are adapted to the free space between the first two chambers while keeping its bending power constant.

Results are shown in Fig. 3(a), where the momentum resolution obtained with this layout, as a function of \(d\), is compared to the resolution for \(d=0\) (equivalent to the 3-point approximation). The slight initial deterioration is due to the loss in lever arm in the measurement before the magnet; for large \(d\), the resolution improves again because the "point-angle" measurement is effectively turned into an "angle-angle" measurement. In any case, the effect is very small for reasonable values of \(d\) of a few 10 cm.

### Barrel

The effect of the multilayer spacing in the barrel is studied in an analogous way. The only difference is that the magnetic field, which is again assumed to vary like \(1/r\), is left unchanged. The first and last multilayer, and the median plane of the middle chamber, are fixed at the radial positions

\[r_{1}=4.6\;\mathrm{m},\quad r_{m}=7.3\;\mathrm{m},\quad r_{6}=10.9\,\mathrm{m}. \tag{37}\]

The result is shown in Fig. 3(b). The \(d\) dependence of the resolution is significantly more pronounced than in the end-cap region because of the larger ratio of multilayer spacing to chamber distance; a typical spacing of \(d=30\) cm causes a relative loss of resolution of \(\sim 10\%\) when compared to \(d=0\). Qualitatively, this effect is expected because moving the multilayers at positions \(r_{2}\) and \(r_{5}\) inside the field volume gives away a part of the bending power provided by the toroid.

## 5 Conclusions

From Table 1 and from Figs. 2 and 3, it appears that the momentum resolution of the ATLAS muon spectrometer is worse than the mathematical optimum that can be obtained with a reasonable number of monolayers, by about \(15-20\%\) for the barrel and by about \(10\%\) for the end-cap region; for the transition region, this degradation will also be of similar Figure 3: _Spectrometer resolution as a function of multilayer spacing \(d\), normalised to the resolution obtained with \(d=0\), for the end-cap region (a) and the barrel (b). The chamber resolution is assumed to be the same in all multilayers._

size. Obviously, an "optimal" layout as it would follow from this note would violate other stringent requirements on the muon spectrometer, such as adequate multilayer spacing for mechanical stability and pattern recognition capability, and sufficient monolayer redundancy in the inner chambers to cope with the large backgrounds expected in this region. Taking such boundary conditions into account, a degradation of resolution of \(10-20\%\) should be acceptable.

Appendix

## Appendix A Error matrices for coordinates, pseudoslopes, and pseudocurvatures

In this Appendix, we give the contributions to the error matrices for coordinate measurements, pseudoslopes, and pseudocurvatures which are due to the intrinsic detector resolution. A more profound discussion of these matrices can be found in Refs. [4, 5], where explicit expressions are given for spectrometers with equal errors on all coordinate measurements. We present here the straightforward generalisation to the case of non-equal measurement errors. In order to include multiple scattering effects into the resolution calculations, the corresponding error matrices have to be added linearly to the ones discussed here. A discussion of multiple scattering errors can also be found in [4, 5]. However, the matrix elements given there cannot be applied to the ATLAS muon spectrometer since they refer to the case where the scattering material is distributed homogeneously throughout the spectrometer, e.g. a massive iron spectrometer.

Assuming a Gaussian distribution for the errors of coordinate measurements, the expectation value for the error of a product of two such measurements is trivially

\[E(x_{i}x_{j})=\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}\delta_{ij}, \tag{38}\]

where \(\delta_{ij}\) is the Kronecker symbol. The error matrices for the pseudoslopes \(s_{i}=(x_{i+1}-x_{i})/(z_{i+1}-z_{i})\) and pseudocurvatures \(\alpha_{i}=s_{i+1}-s_{i}\) introduced in Section 2 are computed from this expression by straightforward algebra:

\[E(\,s_{i}\,s_{i}\,) = \frac{\sigma_{i+1}^{2}+\sigma_{i}^{2}}{(z_{i+1}-z_{i})^{2}} \tag{39}\] \[E(\,s_{i+1}\,s_{i}\,) = \frac{-\sigma_{i+1}^{2}}{(z_{i+2}-z_{i+1})(z_{i+1}-z_{i})}\] (40) \[E(\,s_{j}\,s_{i}\,) = 0,\,\,j>i+1\] (41) \[E(\,\alpha_{i}\,\alpha_{i}\,) = \frac{\sigma_{i+2}^{2}+\sigma_{i+1}^{2}}{(z_{i+2}-z_{i+1})^{2}}+ \frac{2\sigma_{i+1}^{2}}{(z_{i+2}-z_{i+1})(z_{i+1}-z_{i})}+\frac{\sigma_{i+1}^ {2}+\sigma_{i}^{2}}{(z_{i+1}-z_{i})^{2}}\] (42) \[E(\,\alpha_{i}\,\alpha_{i+1}\,) = \frac{-\sigma_{i+2}^{2}}{(z_{i+3}-z_{i+2})(z_{i+2}-z_{i+1})}- \frac{\sigma_{i+2}^{2}+\sigma_{i+1}^{2}}{(z_{i+2}-z_{i+1})^{2}}\] (43) \[-\frac{\sigma_{i+1}^{2}}{(z_{i+2}-z_{i+1})(z_{i+1}-z_{i})}\] \[E(\alpha_{i}\,\alpha_{i+2}\,) = \frac{\sigma_{i+2}^{2}}{(z_{i+3}-z_{i+2})(z_{i+2}-z_{i+1})}\] (44) \[E(\alpha_{i}\,\alpha_{j}\,) = 0,\,\,j>i+2 \tag{45}\]

All matrix elements below the diagonal follow from the symmetry requirement \(E(\,s_{i}\,s_{j}\,)=E(\,s_{j}\,s_{i}\,)\) and \(E(\,\alpha_{i}\,\alpha_{j}\,)=E(\,\alpha_{j}\,\alpha_{i}\,)\).
