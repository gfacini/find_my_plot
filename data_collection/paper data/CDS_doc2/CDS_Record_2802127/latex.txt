## 1 Introduction

Following the experimental discovery of the Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in 2012 [1; 2], major efforts from both collaborations have been dedicated to studying the properties of the Higgs boson. All reported results on the Higgs boson spin and parity [3; 4] and couplings [5; 6] to vector bosons and fermions have been so far consistent with the Standard Model (SM) predictions. However, the properties of the Higgs boson potential, and in particular the Higgs boson self-coupling, are still largely unconstrained.

The Higgs trilinear self-coupling, \(\lambda_{HHH}\), can be constrained via experimental studies of final states arising from the production of two Higgs bosons (\(HH\)). At the LHC, the SM \(HH\) production proceeds mainly through the gluon-gluon fusion (ggF) process with an expected cross-section of \(\sigma_{\rm ggF}^{\rm SM}=36.69^{+6\%}_{-23\%}\) (scale\(+m_{\rm top}\)) \(\pm 3.0\%\) (PDF \(+\)\(\alpha_{S}\)) fb [7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14], evaluated at next-to-next-to-leading order in \(\alpha_{S}\) and including an approximation of finite top-quark-mass effects, for the Higgs boson mass \(m_{H}=125\) GeV and \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, where "scale + \(m_{\rm top}\)" are the uncertainties related to the scale and choice of renormalization scheme of the top-quark mass [13; 14], and "PDF\(+\)\(\alpha_{S}\)" are the uncertainties in the strong coupling constant and parton distribution functions. The sub-dominant SM \(HH\) production mode is the vector boson fusion (VBF) process, which has an expected cross-section of \(\sigma_{\rm VBF}^{\rm SM}=2.1^{+0.03\%}_{-0.04\%}\) (scale) \(\pm 2.1\%\) (PDF\(+\)\(\alpha_{S}\)) fb [15; 16; 17; 18; 19], evaluated at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD. In addition, in beyond the Standard Model (BSM) scenarios, the \(HH\) production rate may be enhanced by an anomalous \(\lambda_{HHH}\) value [20; 21; 22; 23; 24; 25].

The High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) project plans to increase the peak luminosity of \(pp\) collisions by a factor of five with respect to Run 2 of the LHC, and ultimately to deliver 3000-4000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\). Previous ATLAS HL-LHC projections of the \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\), \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) final states and their statistical combination were performed using extrapolations of the early Run 2 measurements with \(24.3\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of data for \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) and \(36.1\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) of data for \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), both at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\). A dedicated analysis using truth information from simulated samples, smeared to emulate the expected ATLAS detector response at the HL-LHC, was developed to estimate prospects for \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\)[26]. Including systematic uncertainties the expected significance for the observation of the SM \(HH\) production was found to be \(3.0\,\sigma\)1 and the signal strength relative to the SM expectation was expected to be measured with an accuracy of 40%. The Higgs boson trilinear self-coupling modifier (\(\kappa_{L}\equiv\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{\rm SM}\)) was expected to be constrained to \(0.25\leq\kappa_{\lambda}\leq 1.9\) at \(1\,\sigma\) confidence level, and \(-0.4\leq\kappa_{\lambda}\leq 7.3\) at \(2\,\sigma\) confidence level.

Footnote 1: The combined significance was updated to \(2.9\,\sigma\) when considering the projected \(b\)-tagging performance expected with the updated ATLAS Inner Tracker Pixel Detector design [27].

This note presents an updated combination of the HL-LHC projection studies of the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final states [28; 29] assessed through extrapolation of the latest available analyses based on the full Run 2 dataset with an integrated luminosity of \(139\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\). The object reconstruction and identification efficiencies are assumed to be identical between the projections and the considered Run 2 analyses [30]. Other aspects, including potentially different triggers, the increased pile-up level, and detector upgrades could contribute to the projections, but they are not considered in this note.

## 2 Description of Run 2 \(HH\) searches

### \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\)

The \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) decay channel has a small branching ratio of 0.26%, but a clean signature thanks to the two photons in the final state. The \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) search [31] selects exactly two photons and two \(b\)-tagged jets, where the di-photon and di-jet systems are both consistent with a SM Higgs boson decay. The \(b\)-jets are identified using the DL1r algorithm [32; 33] using the 77% efficiency working point, which corresponds to a \(1/130\) (\(1/4.9\)) misidentification rate for light-flavor (charm) jets [32]. Electron and muon vetoes are applied for orthogonality with other \(HH\) searches with leptons in their final states. The dominant background processes in the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) search consist of continuum production of photon pairs and jets, and processes where a single Higgs boson decays to a pair of photons. The modified di-photon plus \(b\)-tagged jets system four-body mass \(m^{*}_{b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma}\), defined as \(m^{*}_{b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma}=m_{b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma}-m_{b\bar{b}}-m_{\gamma \gamma}+250\,\text{GeV}\) where \(m_{b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma}\) is the four-body mass, \(m_{b\bar{b}}\) is the two \(b\)-jet invariant mass and \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) is the di-photon invariant mass, is used to split the events into two regions: a high mass (SM-like) category, and a low mass (BSM-like) category. Boosted Decision Trees (BDTs) are trained in both regions and are used to separate signal from background. In the high mass region, the SM (\(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\)) \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) sample is used for training. In the low mass region, a \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\)\(\kappa_{\lambda}=10\) sample is used for training. In each region, two categories based on loose and tight selections on the BDT discriminants are introduced resulting in four final analysis categories. The final statistical results are obtained with a fit to the di-photon invariant mass distribution across all four categories.

### \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\)

The \(HH\to b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) decay channel has a relatively large \(HH\) branching fraction of 7.3%. The \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) search [34] selects two \(\tau\) leptons and exactly two \(b\)-tagged jets. As \(\tau\) leptons can decay leptonically or hadronically, the \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) decay channel has different signal regions targeting semi-leptonic (\(\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\)) and fully-hadronic (\(\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\)) di-\(\tau\) final states.

In the \(b\bar{b}\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channel, events are required to have exactly one electron or muon and one reconstructed hadronic \(\tau\) lepton with opposite charge. In the \(b\bar{b}\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channel, events are required to have exactly two reconstructed hadronic \(\tau\) leptons with opposite charges. An electron and muon veto is applied in the \(b\bar{b}\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channel for orthogonality with the \(b\bar{b}\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channel. In both the \(b\bar{b}\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) channels, the two \(b\)-jets are selected using the DL1r tagger at the 77% efficiency working point. The dominant backgrounds come from \(t\bar{t}\), \(Z\) + heavy flavor (\(Z\)+HF), multi-jet, single top-quark and single Higgs boson production. The normalizations of the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z\)+HF backgrounds are constrained with data in dedicated control regions. The contributions from misidentified \(\tau\) leptons originating from quark- and gluon-initiated jets are estimated using data-driven methods for the \(t\bar{t}\) and multi-jet backgrounds. BDTs and Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are trained and evaluated in each of the \(b\bar{b}\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) signal regions with Monte Carlo samples. Only the SM \(HH\to b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) sample is used for training. The final results are obtained through a fit of the BDT and DNN outputs in the \(b\bar{b}\tau_{\text{had}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau_{\text{lep}}\tau_{\text{had}}\) signal regions.

## 3 Extrapolation procedure

The \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) search channels are projected [28; 29] to the HL-LHC following the procedures below. The projections are combined using the extended statistical framework based on the profile likelihood ratio [35]. Final results are obtained using the asymptotic formulae [35], and upper limits are set following the CLs prescription [36].

First, all signal and background distributions are scaled by a multiplicative factor, which is the ratio between the target integrated luminosity of \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at the HL-LHC to the integrated luminosity of \(139\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) in Run 2.

Next, the change of cross-sections, due to the higher centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) at the HL-LHC, is accounted for with additional scaling factors summarized in Table 1. The cross-sections of the \(HH\) signal and single Higgs boson backgrounds are all scaled following the recommendations [37] from the LHC Higgs Working Group. The remaining backgrounds are scaled by a factor of 1.18 to account for the expected increase in gluon-luminosity at the HL-LHC. In the Run 2 \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) analysis, the normalization of simulated \(Z\)+HF and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds are determined from data. This results in an additional multiplicative factor of 1.37 for the \(Z\)+HF background, while the \(t\bar{t}\) normalization does not change as the multiplicative factor is consistent with unity. The combined results are obtained assuming a Higgs boson mass of \(m_{H}=125.00\), as done in the Run 2 \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\)-\(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) combination [38]. In the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) channel projection, the mass of the Higgs boson is shifted from the Run 2 analysis value of \(125.09\) to \(125.00\). The change in the mass assumption has a negligible impact on the final sensitivity.

The projected results in individual analyses are obtained by considering different scenarios of systematic uncertainties. In the baseline scenario, the systematic uncertainties are adjusted following the latest recommendations for HL-LHC projections [39]. The expected uncertainty on the integrated luminosity (\(L\)) of the full HL-LHC dataset is 1%, while the Run 2 uncertainty is 1.7%. Theoretical systematic uncertainties are reduced by a factor of two relative to those used in the Run 2 analyses, under the assumption of continued theory advances. The statistical components of the experimental uncertainties are scaled according to the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline \hline
**Process** & Scale factor \\ \hline
**Signals** & \\ ggF \(HH\) & 1.18 \\ VBF \(HH\) & 1.19 \\ \hline
**Backgrounds** & \\ ggF \(H\) & 1.13 \\ VBF \(H\) & 1.13 \\ \(WH\) & 1.10 \\ \(ZH\) & 1.12 \\ \(t\bar{t}H\) & 1.21 \\ Others & 1.18 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Scale factors applied to the \(HH\) signal and background processes in the Run 2 \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) analyses to account for the change in cross-sections due to the increase of centre-of-mass energy from \(\sqrt{s}=13\) to \(\sqrt{s}=14\) at the HL-LHC.

increase of the integrated luminosity by \(1/\sqrt{L}\). The Monte Carlo statistical uncertainties are neglected as done in the previous projection studies [26]. The detector-limited components are either kept the same or scaled taking into account detector and performance upgrades. In the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) channel, the uncertainty on the measured value of the Higgs boson mass is reduced from 240 MeV [40] to 20 MeV [37]. The spurious signal uncertainty from the Run 2 analysis is removed assuming that background modeling strategies will improve sufficiently at the HL-LHC [26]. In both the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) Run 2 analyses [31; 34], a reweighting procedure of the simulated ggF and VBF \(HH\) samples is performed to create discriminant distributions for a set of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) values, and a non-closure uncertainty is accounted for this procedure. In their HL-LHC projections, the non-closure uncertainty is removed assuming that computing power will be sufficient to generate signal samples for all relevant \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) values. The systematic uncertainties are modified using scale factors which multiply the magnitudes of the nominal Run 2 systematic uncertainties. These scale factors are summarized in Table 2.

To combine the extrapolated results, the likelihood functions from each channel are multiplied to produce a combined likelihood function. The various searches can then be simultaneously fit to the data to constrain the parameters of interest. All signal regions considered in the combined fit are orthogonal due to different selection criteria or they have a negligible number of overlapping events. The extrapolated systematic uncertainties are correlated between the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) search channels following the same strategies as in Ref. [38].

To provide an envelope for interpreting the results, three additional uncertainty scenarios are considered beyond the baseline configuration described above in the text. The results, presented in Section 4, are obtained considering the following four scenarios:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline \hline
**Source** & **Scale factor** & \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) & \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) \\ \hline

## 4 Results

### \(Hh\) production signal strength

The expected \(HH\) signal significance and precision on the measured signal strength in the SM hypothesis are summarized in Table 3, assuming different uncertainty scenarios. In the baseline scenario, a significance of \(3.2\,\sigma\) is expected to be reached when combining the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) decay channels. The signal strength relative to the SM prediction is expected to be measured with an accuracy of \({}^{+34}_{-31}\%\). Without systematic uncertainties, the expected significance is \(4.6\,\sigma\) and the SM signal strength is expected to be probed with a relative error of \(\pm 23\%\). Under the 'Theoretical uncertainties halved' and 'Run 2 systematic uncertainties' scenarios, the expected significance decreases to \(2.0\,\sigma\) and \(1.7\,\sigma\), respectively. In these two uncertainty configurations, the SM signal strength is expected to be measured with an accuracy larger than \(50\%\).

In the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) channel, one of the main limiting factors to the sensitivity arises from the spurious signal systematic uncertainty associated with the choice of the functional form used for modeling the continuum background. The baseline scenario assumes that the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) spurious signal systematic uncertainty will be 0 at the HL-LHC thanks to improved background modeling strategies. The effect of different levels of spurious signal uncertainty on the baseline scenario was studied in the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) projections [28]. In the most pessimistic projection, where this uncertainty at the HL-LHC is scaled as the continuum background, and it is 25 times the current Run 2 value, the combined significance of the baseline scenario is reduced by 10%. If the spurious signal uncertainty is less than 4 times the current Run 2 value, which is the level suggested by studies of background template-enhancing techniques, the combined significance is reduced by less than 1%.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c|c} \hline \hline  & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{Significance [\(\sigma\)]} & Combined signal \\ Uncertainty scenario & \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) & \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) & Combination & strength precision [\%] \\ \hline No syst. unc. & 2.3 & 4.0 & 4.6 & \(-23/+23\) \\ Baseline & 2.2 & 2.8 & 3.2 & \(-31/+34\) \\ Theoretical unc. halved & 1.1 & 1.7 & 2.0 & \(-49/+51\) \\ Run 2 syst. unc. & 1.1 & 1.5 & 1.7 & \(-57/+68\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Projected significance and signal strength precision of the SM \(HH\) signals at \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) and \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) for the four uncertainty scenarios. The significances for \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) are also summarized.

In the \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) channel, one of the main limiting factors to the sensitivity arises from the statistical uncertainty associated with the Monte Carlo simulated samples [29]. This uncertainty is included in the 'Theoretical uncertainties halved' and 'Run 2 systematic uncertainties' scenarios, but not in the 'Baseline' scenarios. If this statistical uncertainty is neglected in the 'Run 2 systematic uncertainties' scenario, the combined significance for that scenario improves from \(1.7\,\sigma\) to \(2.3\,\sigma\).

In the baseline scenario, the dominant source of uncertainty affecting the combined results is the 100% theoretical uncertainty on the ggF, VBF, and \(W\)-associated single Higgs boson production modes due to the imperfect modeling of additional heavy-flavor jet radiation in these processes [41; 42; 43]. The second largest uncertainty comes from the theoretical uncertainty on the \(HH\) cross-section.

The expected significance is also estimated in cases where the Higgs boson self-coupling may be different from the SM prediction of \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\). For each \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) value, the \(HH\) significance scales with the \(HH\) cross-section and the product of the analysis acceptance times efficiency [38]. Figure 1 shows the \(HH\) significance as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) for all four uncertainty scenarios. The significance is estimated on Asimov datasets produced assuming the signal plus background hypothesis, where the signal is generated with a \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) value under test. In the baseline scenario, evidence for the \(HH\) production (\(3\,\sigma\)) is expected at the HL-LHC if \(\kappa_{\lambda}<1.1\) or \(\kappa_{\lambda}>4.8\), while observation (\(5\,\sigma\)) is expected if \(\kappa_{\lambda}<-0.1\) or \(\kappa_{\lambda}>5.9\).

To further explore the analysis sensitivity, the projected 95% confidence level (CL) limits on the SM \(HH\) signal strength have been evaluated for the various systematic uncertainty scenarios assuming the absence of Higgs boson pair production. They are shown in Figure 2, and summarized for \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and their combination in Table 4. The SM \(HH\) production is expected to be excluded at more than 99% CL in the 'No systematic uncertainty' and 'Baseline' scenarios, and at 96.5% CL in the 'Theory uncertainty halved' scenario. In the 'Run 2 systematic uncertainties' scenario, the 95% CL upper limit on the \(HH\) signal strength is set at 1.16.

Figure 1: Projected \(HH\) significance for different \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) hypotheses at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\text{TeV}\), \(3000\,\text{fb}^{-1}\) at the HL-LHC assuming the four different uncertainty scenarios described in the text. The significance is estimated on Asimov datasets produced under the signal plus background hypothesis, where the signal is generated with the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) value under test. Dashed horizontal lines correspond to \(3\,\sigma\) and \(5\,\sigma\). The dashed vertical line indicates the SM hypothesis of \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\).

Figure 3 presents the significance and the 95% CL limit on the SM \(HH\) signal strength as a function of the integrated luminosity from \(1000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) to \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) at the HL-LHC assuming the four uncertainty scenarios. The 'Run 2 systematic uncertainties' and the 'Theory uncertainty halved' results do not show a large dependence on the increased integrated luminosity, meaning that such scenarios are already expected to be dominated by the effect of systematic uncertainties at \(1000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). In contrast, results in the 'No systematic uncertainties' and the 'Baseline' scenarios improve more substantially with increasing integrated luminosity.

The upper limits for \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) are also included. The limits assume no \(HH\) production.

The limits are derived assuming no \(HH\) production.

### Constraints on the Higgs boson self-coupling

The \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) confidence intervals derived from a likelihood-ratio scan are presented. Several maximum likelihood fits are conducted using an Asimov dataset constructed under the SM hypothesis of \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\). Values of the negative log-profile-likelihood ratio as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) for all four uncertainty scenarios are shown in Figure 4. The corresponding \(1\,\sigma\) and \(2\,\sigma\) confidence intervals are summarized in Table 5. In the baseline uncertainty scenario, the allowed \(1\,\sigma\) (\(2\,\sigma\)) confidence interval for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is expected to be \([0.5,1.6]\) (\([0.0,2.7]\)). With no systematic uncertainties, they are further reduced to \([0.6,1.5]\) (\([0.3,2.1]\)). Figure 5 presents the individual contributions from the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) channels to the combined results assuming the various uncertainty scenarios. It is worth noting that the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) analysis does not exhibit the double minimum feature that occurs in the \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) analysis. This stems from the fact that the search for \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) has different categories based on \(m^{*}_{b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma}\) and can therefore distinguish ambiguous \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) values that are characterized by similar yields, but different \(HH\) mass distributions. The high mass, SM-like categories have strong sensitivity to \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) samples, but are also unable to reject events near \(\kappa_{\lambda}=5\)[28]. The low mass, BSM-like categories are less sensitive to signal when \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is close to 1, and more sensitive to signal where \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is far from 1. Combining the sensitivities of the two categories breaks the degeneracy that would have occurred if the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) analysis had only used a single inclusive mass region.

The significance is evaluated using a signal plus background Asimov dataset generated under the SM hypothesis. The upper limits are derived using background-only Asimov data, where no \(HH\) production is assumed.

Dashed horizontal lines correspond to \(1\,\sigma\) and \(2\,\sigma\) confidence intervals.

The projected 95% CL upper limits on the \(HH\) cross-section as a function of \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) assuming no \(HH\) production are shown in Figure 6 for the baseline uncertainty scenario. The constraints on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) are derived from the intersection of the projection with the \(\kappa_{\lambda}\)-dependent theoretical prediction of the \(HH\) production cross-section at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\)[13]. In the baseline scenario, the projected 95% CL interval on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is found to be \([2.0,4.1]\). The \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) values outside of this interval are expected to be excluded at 95% CL by the HL-LHC using \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\). In particular, the SM hypothesis \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\) is excluded. The \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) constraint intervals derived from the cross-section limit scan for the four uncertainty scenarios are summarized in Table 6.

Figure 6: Expected 95% CL limits on \(HH\) cross-section for different \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) hypotheses at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\), \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) at the HL-LHC with the baseline uncertainty scenario. The expected cross-section limits assume a complete absence of \(HH\) production. The theory prediction curve represents the situation where all parameters and couplings are set to their SM values except for \(\kappa_{\lambda}\). The SM hypothesis corresponds to \(\kappa_{\lambda}=1\).

## 5 Conclusion

A combination of the HL-LHC projection studies of the Higgs boson pair production in the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) final states is presented, based on extrapolations of the full Run 2 analyses.

The projected significance for the SM \(HH\) signal is \(3.2\,\sigma\) (\(4.6\,\sigma\)) assuming the baseline (no systematic uncertainties) scenario. The signal strength relative to the SM prediction is expected to be measured with an accuracy of \({}^{+34}_{-31}\%\) (\(\pm 23\%\)). The \(1\,\sigma\) confidence interval on \(\kappa_{\lambda}\) is constrained to \([0.5,1.6]\) in the baseline scenario or \([0.6,1.5]\) without systematic uncertainties.

Considering the different uncertainty scenarios, the main limitations to the \(HH\) sensitivity are the theoretical uncertainties on the \(HH\) cross-section and on the additional heavy-flavor jet radiation in ggF, VBF and \(WH\) production modes of the single Higgs boson, the limited size of simulated event samples in the projection study of the \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) channel, and the background modeling uncertainty in the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) channel.
