**Abstract**

The performances of reduced Inner Detector layouts are compared to the performance of the full layout presented in the Inner Detector Technical Design Report. Three layouts have been fully simulated: a "new" TDR layout, with a material distribution as described in volume 2 of the TDR, a "new" layout with only 2 pixel layers and one with only 3 SCT layers. Reconstruction is performed with modified versions of the xKalman and iPatRec programs. Results are presented (without and with high luminosity pile-up) for the study of b-tagging, using \(\rm H\to b\bar{b}\) and \(\rm H\to u\overline{u}\) events with \(\rm m_{H}=400\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\). The b-tagging performance is degraded by \(\sim\)30% if a pixel layer is removed and by \(\sim\)10% if an SCT layer is removed.The consequences of these degradations are explored for several physics studies. In particular, the loss of significance for \(\rm WH\) (\(\rm H\to b\bar{b}\)) from removing a pixel layer is \(\sim\)6% and \(\sim\)2% for an SCT layer. In the light of inevitable losses of performance from reduced detector efficiency and pile-up, further loss of performance resulting from a change of layout is undesirable.

## 1 Introduction

The pixel B-layer is now accepted as a permanent addition to the Inner Detector (ID). This represents an increase in the number of tracking layers, with a corresponding increase in the amount of material in the Inner Detector. This means an increase of the interaction probability of charged and neutral particles and therefore of the number of particles produced in these interactions. There is also concern expressed by the ATLAS calorimeter community and the LHCC that the ID material is at the upper end of what can be considered as acceptable in front of the calorimeters [1]. While it was thought that the removal of a precision tracking layer might improve the performance of the calorimeter, the purpose of this note is to evaluate the consequences of such a removal for physics with the Inner Detector and for ATLAS as a whole.

The most challenging pattern recognition study addressed in the ID TDR concerns the reconstruction and subsequent tagging of \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{u}\overline{\mathrm{u}}\) with \(\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{H}}=400\)\(\mathrm{GeV}/\mathrm{c}^{2}\)[2]. In this note, we report on a update of that study with various reduced layouts. To facilitate a comparison of the pattern recognition capabilities of these layouts, only the minimum necessary set of changes have been made from the TDR reconstruction and analysis procedures [3].

The next section describes the layouts which have been simulated and the data sets which have been produced. Then we present the comparison of the b-tagging performances of the different layouts and their implications for ATLAS physics. In the following sections we summarise the other consequences on Inner Detector and Calorimeter performance. Finally we conclude with some comments on the overall performance of ATLAS.

## 2 Description of Layouts

The baseline layout is the "TDR" layout [4], consisting of 7 precision layers (3 pixel and 4 SCT), as defined in September 1996. Between that time and the publication of the Inner Detector TDR, the designs of a few parts of the Inner Detector systems were modified, as summarised in ref.[5]. Although we believed that these modifications would not affect the performance in any significant way, we have upgraded the simulation to take these changes into account.

### Upgrades to the Baseline Layout

The differences between the "TDR" version of the simulation and the June 1997 version are listed below:

* the average material in the pixel barrels (disks) has been increased from 1.39% (0.94%) of a radiation length to 1.63% (1.63%) \(X_{0}\)[6];
* the sign of the \(\beta\)-tilt angle (the angle between the normal to each module and the radial direction in the x-y plane) of the barrel pixels has been changed;
* the B-layer services have been routed along the beam pipe and then out in front of the end-cap cryostat;
* GaAs has been replaced by silicon in the inner rings of the SCT wheels;* the thickness of the material at the outer radius of the end-cap TRT straws has been increased by 5% X\({}_{0}\).

The main effect of these changes is an increase of material at low radius (pixels) and large radius (TRT), accompanied by a more even distribution of the Inner Detector material as a function of \(\eta\). Another effect is a small improvement in point resolution of the barrel pixel detector - a consequence of the smaller average cluster size in R-\(\varphi\), due to the combined effect of the \(\beta\)-tilt and the Lorentz angle. In the following, this layout will be referred to as the "new TDR" layout. This layout is currently used for all on-going simulations.

### Reduced Layouts

For the comparative study of b-tagging performance, we have used two different approaches:

1. following the procedure introduced in ref.[7], the data sets produced with the "TDR" layout have been analysed in three ways: 1. as they are: results of this analysis are presented under the heading "3+4"; 2. suppressing all digits from the 2nd pixel barrel and the 2nd and 4th pixel disks ("2*+4"); this is equivalent to removing the information from one out of three pixel layers over the full \(\eta\) coverage; 3. suppressing all digits from the 3rd SCT barrel, the 2nd and 8th SCT wheels and the inner and middle ring of the 4th SCT wheel ("3+3*"; sometimes referred to as "3+4-1"); this is equivalent to removing the information from one out of four SCT layers over the full \(\eta\) coverage. In cases b) and c), the secondary tracks originating from the suppressed layer have not been considered for the analysis. Nevertheless, all tracks crossing the inactive material are subject to multiple scattering and interactions. Multiple scattering in the inactive material is taken into account by the track reconstruction procedures. Figure 2-1 shows the "TDR"

layout; the detectors shown in bold had their digits suppressed for the "2*+4" layout (pixels) and the "3+3*" layout (SCT) respectively.
2. new data sets have been generated with the "new TDR" geometry: 1. with the default ("3+4") layout; 2. with a layout without the 2nd pixel barrel, the 2nd and 4th pixel disks and their services ("2+4"), see Figure 2-2; 3. with an optimised layout with only 3 equally spaced SCT barrels and 7 SCT wheels ("3+3"), see Figure 2-3.

Figure 2-2: Schematic diagram of the Inner Detector “2+4” layout.

Figure 2-3: Schematic diagram of the Inner Detector “3+3” layout.

Figure 2-4 shows the material distribution, in units of radiation lengths, as a function of \(\eta\), for the "TDR", the "new TDR", the "2+4" and the "3+3" layouts. Figure 2-5 shows the differences in material distributions between the "new TDR" and the "TDR" layouts, and between the "3+4" and the "2+4" and "3+3" layouts, respectively for the pixels and the SCT. Note that in Figures 2-4 and 2-5 the material associated to each detector is only the active material and that part of its own inactive material which is contained within the detector volume, in contrast to Figures 3.18 and 3.19 of the ID TDR, where the material was divided by radial position.

New data sets, consisting of 2500 H \(\rightarrow\) b\(\overline{\rm b}\) and 10000 H \(\rightarrow\) u\(\overline{\rm u}\) events, have been generated for each layout. Data sets with high luminosity pile-up (24 minimum bias events for the pixels and SCT and 32 for the TRT) have also been produced for each layout.

### Pattern Recognition

Although the general philosophy of the pattern recognition programs xKalman and iPatRec has remained unchanged [3], both of them have undergone significant technical changes. These were necessary to enable the programs to work with equal performance on data sets produced with different geometries, to ignore digits from "suppressed layers" or from "inefficient" detectors, and to work efficiently and in a reasonable amount of time on events with high-luminosity pile-up. In addition, improvements to the performance are continuously being implemented as the understanding of the software progresses.

The program xKalman uses a histogramming method to find candidate tracks in the TRT, then extrapolates them into the SCT and pixel detectors using a filtering algorithm (Kalman filter). The track found in the precision detectors is then extrapolated outwards through the TRT to include drift-time hits from the straws which can be unambiguously assigned to each track candidate; finally a global track fit is performed.

The program iPatRec uses a combinatorial method to find candidate tracks in the precision detectors, then extrapolates them and associates TRT hits. The final track parameters are also calculated using a global track fit.

## 3 b-tagging

### Track Selection and Algorithm

The b-tagging performance of different layouts can be compared using as a measure the u-jet rejection at 50% b-tagging efficiency (called \(\rm R_{u}\) in the following). The details of the analysis can be found in the Inner Detector TDR [2]. A brief reminder of the default selection cuts follows:

* jets are defined by collecting all tracks with \(\rm p_{T}>1\) GeV/c, \(\rm\,|\rm\,n\,|<\)2.5 and \(\rm\Delta R<0.4\) around the parton directions;
* tracks must satisfy in addition the following quality cuts for b-tagging:
* at least 9 hits in precision detectors;
* at least 2 hits in pixel detectors, one of which is in the first pixel layer (B-layer);
* impact parameter smaller than 1 mm in the R-\(\varphi\) plane;
* the method for b-tagging is a maximum likelihood ratio method based on the significance of the signed impact parameter.

If the cut on the number of precision hits is increased, both the efficiency and \(\rm R_{u}\) are degraded, irrespective of the layout. If, in contrast, this cut is relaxed, the xKalman results are not significantly affected, whereas the iPatRec results, including \(\rm R_{u}\), do change significantly.

The b-tagging default cuts are modified in the case of the reduced layouts as follows:

* - "2+4": at least 8 hits in precision detectors and 1 hit in pixel detectors;
* "3+3": at least 7 hits in precision detectors and 2 hits in pixel detectors.

### Analysis of the "TDR" Layout with Suppressed Digits

A first analysis, using the data sets produced for the ID TDR and the iPatRec reconstruction program, has already been published. Ref.[7] contains a detailed description of the procedure and of the performance, if digits from various combinations of detectors are suppressed. Results from iPatRec have been presented at the May 1997 ID Performance meeting and results from xKalman have also been presented at the September 1997 ID Performance meeting. Here we recall the main results and present in Table 3-1 a comparison of the following analyses:

* - reconstruction with xKalman, with the addition, for the sake of comparison with iPatRec, of a cut on the quality of the track fit \(\chi^{2}\)/dof\(<\)3 (this cut is intrinsic in the iPatRec pattern recognition procedure);
* - reconstruction with iPatRec with the default cuts;
* - reconstruction with iPatRec applying the same cuts for each layout: 7 hits in the precision detectors, including 2 pixel hits (one of which in the B-layer), plus the 1 mm impact parameter cut.

As can be seen from the first two columns of Table 3-1, the two reconstruction programs, although using different algorithms, agree to a good accuracy for all layouts. The errors on the \(\rm R_{u}\) values are strongly correlated, as the same events are used for all analyses. The errors on differences are therefore much smaller than the errors on the absolute values of \(\rm R_{u}\).

The default cuts give similar track reconstruction efficiencies for the different layouts, accompanied by a significant increase in the number of fakes and secondaries for the reduced layouts. A large degradation is observed for the "2*+4" layout, where the dominant effect is due to tracks with wrongly associated pixel hits. For the "3+3*" layout, the suppressed SCT layer is further away from the vertex region, thus the degradation is less pronounced.

Using the same cuts for all layouts gives similar fake rates in each case and a somewhat smaller increase of the secondary rate for the reduced layouts. The reconstruction efficiency is also higher for the TDR layout. However for the TDR layout there is an increase in the number of secondaries produced after the B-layer with a wrong hit associated in this layer, accounting for the anomalous reduction in rejection observed when comparing the TDR to the "3+3*" layout. In the case of iPatRec, these wrongly associated secondaries are characterised by very low track fit probabilities which suggest that a harder cut could be made on the fit \(\chi^{2}\) probability. The improved performance obtained with the "7+2" cut in the "2*+4" case is a consequence of the 2 pixel requirement, which reduces the high rate of wrong associations observed on tracks formed from the B-layer and SCT without intervening hits. The 2 pixel minimum is somewhat optimistic for this layout as demanding hits in both layers leaves no contingency for detector degradation effects (inefficiencies).

### Analysis of the "New TDR" and Reduced Layouts

The results in this section are quoted for each of the 3 layouts, for the so-called "default cuts" (Section 3.1) and for the 3 following conditions:

* default conditions: 97% hit efficiency in precision detectors, no pile-up;
* hit efficiency reduced to 90% in the precision detectors. In addition to the original 3% of digits flagged as "inefficient", xKalman removes randomly 7% of the digits and iPatRec assigns a 3.5% random inefficiency to read-out chips and a 3.5% random inefficiency to whole detector modules. The requirement on the minimum number of precision hits is reduced by one when applying the default cuts;
* - with pile-up corresponding to a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-2}\).

It has been found that if the same cuts are applied to xKalman and iPatRec internally and externally, then the results are in broad agreement (see for example Table 3.1). Therefore, in some of the studies which follow, results are presented from just one of the programs to provide illustration and avoid repetition.

Figure 3.1 shows the rejection factor \(R_{u}\) as a function of \(\epsilon_{b}\) averaged over \(|\eta|<\)2.5; Figures 3.1 to 3.1 show the \(\eta\)-dependencies of \(R_{u}\) for \(\epsilon_{b}\)=50%, of the primary track finding efficiency, of the secondary rate and of the fake rate. The results from the xKalman program are shown with the default selection cuts. The iPatRec results are broadly similar, except:

* a sharper dip in efficiency at \(\eta\)-1.5 for primary track reconstruction (\(\sim\)84% for iPatRec and \(\sim\)87% for xKalman);
* a much lower fake rate, 0.05% for iPatRec and 0.2% for xKalman;
* - fewer secondaries (\(\sim\)1.8%) as the pattern recognition is initiated from closer to the vertex, before some of the secondaries have been produced.

Some of these differences are due to the implicit \(\chi^{2}\) cut used inside iPatRec.

#### 3.3.1 u-jet Rejection

Table 3-2 shows the u-jet rejection for 50% b-jet efficiency found by xKalman and iPatRec for the default and reduced detector efficiency conditions, and in presence of pile-up (xKalman only). A clear degradation is observed for the reduced layouts compared to the default setup. The degradation, over the whole \(\eta\) spectrum, is more pronounced in the case of the "2+4" layout. In the case of "3+3", the degradation happens mainly in the forward region (see Figure 3-2) and is correlated to the increase of secondary tracks (see Figure 3-5).

\end{table}
Table 2: u-jet rejection for 50% b-jet efficiency for the default and reduced layouts and for different conditions.

From the table, it can be seen that the performance is worse for the reduced layouts than the "3+4" layout. In the case of the primary track efficiency, the differences increase when the detector efficiency falls or pile-up is added. In the case of the secondary and fake rates, the differences are affected most strongly by the addition of pile-up. Figures 3-4 to 3-6 show these efficiencies and rates as a function of \(\eta\) for the default conditions.

Tracks with more than 20% spoilt (wrong or shared) hits in precision detectors have typically 30% worse \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) resolution and tails beyond 3\(\sigma\) around 10%. Tracks with wrong pixel hits have typically 40% worse impact parameter (\(\mathrm{d_{0}}\)) resolution and tails beyond 3\(\sigma\) around 20%. Figure 3-7 shows the impact parameter significance (signed impact parameter divided by its error) for tracks without and with non-unique pixel hits. The distribution is shifted towards positive values as the hit density is higher in the jet core than at the edge of the jet: it is therefore more probable to pick up a wrong hit which pulls the track towards the jet axis. The degradation appears mainly for the "2+4" layout, where the increase in the fraction of primary tracks in the tails of the impact parameter distribution contributes directly to the reduction of the u-jet rejection power.

#### Further Selection Cuts

The main limitation to the b-tagging performance arises from secondary tracks, i.e. tracks originating from interactions of primary tracks with detector material. In simulated events, one can remove secondary tracks from the list of reconstructed tracks used for b-tagging, using the "truth" information provided by the simulation; in this case, \(\mathrm{R_{u}}\) would improve considerably, as shown in Table 3-4. In real events, secondary tracks can only be rejected by applying appropriate cuts on track quality. These cuts have to be adapted to the quality of the tracks being found by the pattern recognition programs, and are therefore different for xKalman and iPatRec. The additional xKalman cuts are:

- impact parameter in the R-z plane relative to the primary interaction point \(<1.5\) mm;
- at most 1 shared hit in the pixels;
- at most 2 shared hits in the precision detectors.

Figure 3-7: Impact parameter significance for primary tracks with only “unique” pixel hits (solid) and with at least a wrong or shared pixel hit (dashed), “3+4” layout (xKalman).

For iPatRec, the same cuts are used for all layouts and efficiencies:

- at least 7 hits in precision detectors;

- at least 2 hits in the pixel detectors, one of which is in the B-layer;

- impact parameter smaller than 1 mm in the R-\(\varphi\) plane;

- impact parameter in the R-z plane relative to the intersection of the highest \(\rm p_{T}\) track with the beam axis smaller than 2.0 mm;

- \(\chi^{2}\) probability of the track fit \(>\)1%.

The rejection factors calculated with these cuts are also shown in Table 3-4. As an example of the reconstruction performance with these cuts, Figures 3-8 to 3-13 show the rejection factor \(\rm R_{u}\) as a function of \(\rm\epsilon_{b}\), the \(\rm\eta\) dependence of \(\rm R_{u}\) for \(\rm\epsilon_{b}\)=50%, the primary track finding efficiency, the secondary rate and the fake rate obtained with iPatRec.

These improved cuts effectively select a slightly smaller but better measured sample of tracks. The net effect is an increase in \(\rm R_{u}\) for all configurations. Table 3-5 shows the track quality obtained with iPatRec before and after applying the improved cuts. Note that what is called the "primary track efficiency" is in fact the fraction of simulated primary tracks which are considered for the b-tagging algorithm; the decrease in this rate is more than compensated by the decrease in secondaries and fakes and the improvement in precision of the measurement of the surviving tracks, as can be seen from the improvement in \(\rm R_{u}\) in most cases.

From Tables 3-4 and 3-5, it is clear that, even with improved track selections, it is not possible to achieve with any of the reduced layouts the same b-tagging performance as with the default layout. This is even more pronounced in the cases of reduced detector efficiency and of high luminosity. Note that the different ways to apply inefficiencies in xKalman and iPatRec produce slightly different results: in the case of pixel or strip clusters, the random inefficiency applied by xKalman will displace the centre of gravity of the remains of the cluster, shifting the reconstructed track from its real trajectory; whereas in the more realistic iPatRec scheme, a dead chip (or module) may introduce confusion in the pattern recognition, result in tracks with

#### Comparison of u-jet Rejections for \(\rm m_{H}\)=400 and 100 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)

All the results quoted above were obtained for jets with an average \(\rm p_{T}\) of 200 GeV/c and an average charged track multiplicity about 10 in a cone with \(\rm\Delta R\)\(<\)0.4 around the b-jet axis. The degradations observed for the reduced layouts are likely to be dependent on track multiplicity and density within jets. In order to estimate this effect, we can compare the results obtained by removing hits (and not layers) for \(\rm m_{H}\)=400 and 100 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) with the "TDR" layout, as shown in Table 3-6. These results are strongly correlated as they are obtained from the same data sets, therefore differences are much more significant than the statistical errors would indicate.

As expected, the significantly lower \(\rm p_{T}\) range of the jets from \(\rm H\to b\overline{b}\) decays with \(\rm m_{H}=100\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) results in a significant improvement in \(\rm R_{u}\) with respect to \(\rm m_{H}=400\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\). This improvement is seen both in the case of the default cuts and of the improved cuts.

In the ID TDR, the physics potential for observing the Higgs in WH production with \(\rm m_{H}=100\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\), W\(\rightarrow\)lv and H\(\rightarrow\)bb\(\overline{b}\) was studied in some detail [8]. The electron or muon from the W provides the trigger, while the signal is observed in the \(\rm b\overline{b}\) invariant mass. The significance of the signal was evaluated in the light of several backgrounds, some of which were reducible (containing non-b jets) and some of which were irreducible (containing b-jets). The raw efficiencies obtained from the ID studies reported earlier in the TDR were transformed into quantities better suited to the parton-labelling in ATLFAST1 and the efficiencies were evaluated as functions of the jet \(\rm p_{T}\).

Footnote 1: For example, what was generated as a u-jet in the ID study may have undergone significant hard gluon emission followed by gluon splitting to a \(\rm b\overline{b}\) pair which would be labelled as a b-jet in ATLFAST.

The table of [8] explicitly identifies all jet types in terms of b, c or light-quark (or gluon) jets, and the contribution of each process to the total rate in the mass interval is directly proportional to the product of the efficiencies for selecting each jet type as a b-jet. Hence the different contributions can readily be evaluated for different values of the efficiencies. This has been done with the following assumptions:* b-jet efficiencies for vertex tagging are taken as 50%1, and the rejections against other jets are evaluated at this efficiency. The efficiency for the inclusion of a soft-lepton tag is assumed unchanged.
* c-jet efficiencies are assumed unchanged at 15%.
* light-quark efficiencies needed as input to the calculations of [8] can be derived by scaling by the ratio of the appropriate rejection obtained in the earlier sections of the TDR (50 in the case of \(\rm m_{H}=400\)\(\rm GeV/c^{2}\) and 80 in the case of \(\rm m_{H}=100\)\(\rm GeV/c^{2}\)) and the values of \(\rm R_{u}\) found in this work.2

Footnote 1: This manifests itself as 53% in the TDR, since some allowance was made for selection cuts in the analysis.

The calculations contained in the TDR correspond to \(\rm m_{H}=100\)\(\rm GeV/c^{2}\) and an integrated luminosity of 3\(\times 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), while the majority of studies described in this note correspond to \(\rm m_{H}=400\)\(\rm GeV/c^{2}\). The last assumption listed above allows for the \(\rm p_{T}\) dependence of the rejection (as illustrated in Figure 6-59 of the TDR) in a simple way - it is impossible to do better without repeating the ATLFAST simulations which were performed for the TDR. However, the assumption is likely to cause overestimation of the consequences of reduced layouts for the 100\(\rm GeV/c^{2}\) Higgs, since the more energetic jets will be tighter and hence more prone to confusion.

In what follows, two quantities have been examined:

* The significance (S) of the signal, defined as \(signal/\sqrt{background}\).
* The ratio (\(\rm R_{bgnd}\))3 of the _reducible_ to _irreducible_ backgrounds. The most important reducible backgrounds arise from QCD processes with relatively large and theoretically uncertain cross-sections, such as Wjj. The rate for these events is reduced substantially by large rejection factors \(\rm R_{u}\) for the light-quark jets. Consequently, the rate of these backgrounds is very uncertain, owing to the large to uncertainties in the cross-section and the tagging. Hence, the larger \(\rm R_{bgnd}\), the greater the potential for large systematic errors in the estimation of the significance of a Higgs signal.

Footnote 3: For example, a value of \(\rm R_{u}=81\) for \(\rm m_{H}=400\)\(\rm GeV/c^{2}\) would lead to the light quark jet efficiency being multiplied by 50/81.

Figure 3-14 shows the significance which can be obtained as a function of \(\rm R_{u}\), where \(\rm R_{u}\) corresponds to the values evaluated for \(\rm m_{H}=400\)\(\rm GeV/c^{2}\). It can be seen that, for \(\rm R_{u}\) greater than \(\sim\)50, the significance changes quite slowly since the backgrounds with heavy-flavour jets dominate. Figure 3-15 shows the ratio of reducible to irreducible backgrounds. This does not fall to zero as \(\rm R_{u}\) becomes large because of the presence of backgrounds containing charm. The fractional changes in this ratio do not depend strongly on the use of the lepton tag, and for what follows only the ratios for the vertex tag alone are given. As in the case of other physics channels, it is desirable to achieve \(\rm R_{bgnd}\) values well below one for the reasons mentioned above.

Tables 3-7 and 3-8 show the expectations using the values of \(\rm R_{u}\) corresponding to xKalman with the "improved cuts" taken from Table 3-4 (for \(\rm m_{H}=400\)\(\rm GeV/c^{2}\)) and Table 3-6 (for \(\rm m_{H}=100\)\(\rm GeV/c^{2}\) and with the original "TDR" layout). The fractional changes relative to the "3+4" layout are shown for the different quantities. The sensitivity to the layout changes is reduced compared to previous presentations [9] because of the "improved cuts". These cuts have reduced the differences in \(\rm R_{u}\) between the various layouts (see Table 3-4). Also, since the values

of \(\mathrm{R_{u}}\) have been increased by the cuts, the reducible background has become less important relative to the irreducible background - the values of \(\mathrm{R_{u}}\) are in a place on the significance curves of Figure 3-14 with a smaller gradient. Hence it is very important to consider what happens with reduced values of \(\mathrm{R_{u}}\) where the gradient of the significance distribution is greater. This is the case for the examples of reduced detector efficiency and pile-up - information which is only available for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\) = 400 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) data. Note the considerable reduction in significance with respect to the default conditions.

Using the rejections obtained for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\) = 400 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\), it can be seen that if a pixel layer is removed, the significance of a WH signal will be reduced by \(\sim\)6%; if an SCT layer is removed, this

#### Other Physics Using b-tagging

#### 3.4.2.1 Top Physics

b-tagging will be an essential component in Top Physics - see Section 11.10 of the Technical Proposal [11]. For Top Physics itself, the b-tagging is not quite so crucial since there is a huge cross-section for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production (6\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\) pairs per day at 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{\text{-}2}\)s-1) and, with this rate, there is the possibility of demanding very clear signatures, e.g. including both an electron and a muon from the two W's, or requiring top quarks with very high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\). On the other hand, as shown in [12], the complete reconstruction of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) pairs with purely hadronic decays from the top quarks is subject to large combinatorial backgrounds from other jets in the events, and therefore b-tagging turns out to be a powerful tool to minimise this type of background.

##### 3.4.2.2 Observation of the Higgs in \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\)H Production

The sensitivity to H\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) in WH production shown above is marginal. This signal will be complemented by \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\)H production, where a search is made for 3 or 4 b-jets [10]. The previous studies showed that the greatest sensitivity came from demanding only 3 b-jets. However, there are significant combinatorial backgrounds arising in the signal events from the 3 different pairings of the candidate b-jets to form the Higgs; further, the signal and background shapes are very similar. Therefore, it is felt necessary to demand 4 b-jets and to consider complete reconstruction of both top quarks [13].

It is less easy to estimate the sensitivity to \(\mathrm{R_{u}}\) for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\)H production since the different components of the background (specifically, the flavour of QCD jets) are not explicitly given in [10]. To provide some quantitative estimate of the sensitivity of this analysis to \(\mathrm{R_{u^{\prime}}}\) the information in Table 19 of [10] for 4 b-jets has been considered and simple assumptions as to the nature of the irreducible backgrounds have been made. After 3 years of low luminosity running (3\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\) pb\({}^{\text{-}1}\)), with \(\mathrm{\varepsilon_{b}}\)=50% and \(\mathrm{R_{u}}\)=80, a sensitivity of 1.9 could be achieved. The most important source of background is the process \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\)jj, where the reducible and irreducible components are of the same magnitude. A 10% (30%) reduction in \(\mathrm{R_{u}}\) would reduce the sensitivity by about 2% (9%). While this channel is more difficult to reconstruct completely than the WH channel, it will be easier to search for at high luminosity, due to the absence of the tight jet veto cuts applied to the WH candidate events in order to reduce the large backgrounds.

##### 3.4.2.3 SUSY Spectroscopy

Precisely which SUSY particles and decays are observable will depend significantly on the model parameters. Nevertheless, it is clear that b-tagging will play a significant role [14], especially for the so-called Points 1, 2 and 5 where \(\mathrm{\chi^{0}}_{\text{2}}\)\(\rightarrow\)h\(\mathrm{\chi^{0}}_{\text{1}}\) with h\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) (\(\mathrm{\chi^{0}}_{\text{1}}\) is the LSP) is kinematically allowed.

The light SUSY Higgs h should be copiously produced at low luminosity and its mass determined from the \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) invariant mass. The other neutral Higgs A and H, might be observable after high luminosity running through \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\)A,H production with A,H\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\)[15]. In this case also, b-tagging will be of great importance since four b-jets have to be identified in each event (as in the case of \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\)H production).

The reconstruction of h\(\rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) will often be the starting point for SUSY spectroscopy:

### \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) Reconstruction

The SCT layers are important for reconstructing \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) decays, for example in \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\rightarrow\mathrm{J/\psi+}\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) decays. The mean energy of \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\)'s from \(\mathrm{B^{0}_{d}}\) decays is 5.4 GeV, resulting in a \(\mathrm{\gamma c\tau}\) value of 29 cm. The analysis reported in Section 6.5 of the ID TDR demanded 4 hits per track in at least 2 super-layers - the minimum required to fully reconstruct the momentum vector of a \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\). The efficiency for reconstructing \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) decays as a function of decay radius is shown in Figure 4-3. Should one set of SCT layers be removed, then it is anticipated that the layers in the barrel would be evenly spaced (as described in Section 2.2), causing the 2nd from last layer to be moved inwards by 3.7 cm. This would result in a reconstruction efficiency loss of at least 5% for \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{s}}\) decays; this loss would obviously increase in case of a reduced detector efficiency.

## 5 Calorimeter Performance

The main effect of the Inner Detector material on the electromagnetic calorimeter performance is to produce low-energy tails in the calorimeter energy measurement. A photon/electron shower which starts in the Inner Detector is opened in \(\varphi\) by the magnetic field, the effect being larger for the smaller particle energies and interaction radii. In order to preserve the shower containment in the EM calorimeter, and therefore a good energy resolution, a large and asymmetric cluster (bigger in \(\varphi\) than in \(\eta\)) has to be used. For instance, whilst for unconverted photons clusters of size 3\(\times\)5 cells in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi\) are large enough to contain the shower, low-energy electrons (E \(<\) 100 GeV) and converted photons1 have to be reconstructed in clusters of 3\(\times\)7 cells in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi\). Despite this, low-energy tails persist, as shown in Figure 5-1. The use of clusters larger than 3\(\times\)7 cells is prevented by the fact that the contribution of the electronic and pile-up noise to the energy resolution would become intolerably large [17]. Figure 5-1 also shows that the tails are larger for small interaction radii, therefore the material in the innermost layers of the Inner Detector is potentially the most damaging for the calorimeter performance.

Footnote 1: Throughout this note, a photon is considered as converted if the conversion occurs at a radius smaller than 80 cm and a z-position smaller than 280 cm, i.e. in the region where it can be efficiently identified by the Inner Detector.

The impact of the three Inner Detector layouts discussed in the previous sections on the EM calorimeter performance has been determined by looking at the calorimeter response to single electrons and by evaluating the experimental acceptance for the two most sensitive physics channels: H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) and H \(\rightarrow\) ZZ\({}^{*}\)\(\rightarrow\) 4e.

Figure 5-1: Energy spectra reconstructed in the EM calorimeter in a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi\) = 3 \(\times\) 7 cell cluster (normalised to the generated particle energy), for electrons of E\({}_{\rm T}\) = 10 GeV at \(\eta\) = 1.2. The full (resp. dashed) histogram is for electrons with an interaction radius larger than 80 cm (resp. smaller than 30 cm).

### Tails in Electron \(\mathbf{p_{T}}\) Distributions

Low-energy tails and their dependence on the interaction radius have been studied with electrons of E\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\)=10 GeV at \(\eta\)=1.2. At this rapidity, the material in the Inner Detector reaches 0.8 X\({}_{0}\) (see Figure 2-4) and low-E\({}_{\mathrm{T}}\) electrons are affected the most by it. Figure 5-2 shows the distribution of the interaction radius, defined as the radius at which the electron has radiated the hardest Bremsstrahlung photon, for the "3+4" layout. Clear peaks are visible at the positions of the Pixel and Silicon layers1, as well as a continuous distribution in the TRT region. The open histogram is for all electrons and the shape and height of the peaks simply reflect the distribution and amount of material in the various parts of the Inner Detector. The black histogram is for electrons in the low-energy tails of the calorimeter energy measurement, i.e. below \(-2.5\sigma\) from the peak of the energy distribution (\(\sigma\)=3.5% is the calorimeter energy resolution without the contribution of the electronic and pile-up noise). At this rapidity, the fraction of events in the tails is 19.2\(\pm\)0.6%. It can be seen that the tails are populated mainly by electrons, which have interacted in the precision layers of the Inner Detector. A more quantitative estimate of the contribution of the various layers to the tails is given in Table 5-1. Each of the pixel and SCT layers produces about 2% of tails. A similar contribution comes from the ensemble of the TRT and the services running at the external radius, despite the fact that the total material in this region is much larger than in a single precision layer. Some decrease of the tails with radius is visible also in the three SCT layers. The typical error on these numbers is 0.2%. Table 5-1 shows also the total amount of tails and their breakdown for the reduced layouts. In both cases, the total fraction of events in the tails is about 16%, which represents a gain of 15% with respect to the baseline layout.

Footnote 1: Note that at this rapidity, the electron track crosses only three SCT layers before entering the end-cap region.

### Consequences for H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\)

**Table 5-2**: Main results for the H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel (m\({}_{\rm H}\)=100 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)) obtained with the three layouts. The statistical error on the acceptances and efficiencies is 0.5%.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c|} \hline  & 3+4 & 2+4 & 3+3 \\ \hline Events with converted \(\gamma\) & 39.6\% & 35.8\% & 35.6\% \\ Photon efficiency & 78.1\% & 79.9\% & 78.2\% \\ Acceptance in mass bin & 84.2\% & 83.7\% & 84.0\% \\ (unconverted photons) & & & \\ Acceptance in mass bin & 80.0\% & 80.8\% & 80.0\% \\ (all photons) & & & \\ Relative S/\(\sqrt{\rm B}\) & 1 & 1.03 & 1.00 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The impact of the Inner Detector layout on the H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel has been studied for m\({}_{\rm H}\)=100 GeV/c\({}^{2}\). About 10000 events were fully simulated in the ATLAS detector for the three layouts. The statistics is reduced to about 4000 events per layout after the kinematic and photon identification cuts. Table 5-2 summarises the main results obtained with the three layouts. The fraction of events containing at least one converted photon decreases from about 40% in the "3+4" layout to about 36% in the reduced layouts. The photon identification efficiency is 2% larger in the "2+4" layout than in the two other layouts, owing to the reduced amount of material at small radius. The acceptance for unconverted photons in the optimum mass bin of \(\pm\)1.4\(\sigma\) (\(\sigma\)=1.3 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) is the mass resolution including all contributions) is about 84%, and is the same for the three layouts, as expected. When all photons are considered, the acceptance in the mass bin is 1% larger for the "2+4" layout, again owing to the reduced amount of material at small radius. Note that the acceptance in the mass bin for a gaussian distribution would be 83.8%, so the tails are at the level of 4%. The last row of Table 5-2 shows that the "2+4" layout would provide a gain of 3% in the signal significance at high luminosity with respect to the "3+4" layout. Part of this gain would come from the larger photon identification efficiency and part from the larger acceptance in the mass bin. On the other hand, the "3+3" layout would not provide any significant gain with respect to the "3+4" layout for the H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel.

### Consequences for H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\)

The H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel is expected to be more sensitive than the H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel to the amount of material in the Inner Detector, because of the presence of four electrons of relatively low p\({}_{\rm T}\) in the final state. About 4000 H \(\rightarrow\) ZZ\({}^{*}\)\(\rightarrow\) 4e events with m\({}_{\rm H}\)=130 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) have been fully simulated in the ATLAS detector for each layout. About 1500 events per layout survive the kinematic cuts. Table 5-3 shows the resulting acceptances for the three layouts in the optimum mass bin of \(\pm\)2\(\sigma\), where \(\sigma\)=1.4 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) is the mass resolution including only the sampling term (no noise, no pile-up, no constant term). Results obtained with internal Bremsstrahlung switched off and on are shown separately. With the "3+3" layout, the acceptance in the mass bin would increase by about 2% with respect to the "3+4" layout. With the "2+4" layout, the acceptance would increase by 3-4%. This translates into a maximum gain of 2% (3-4%) in the signal significance for the "3+3" layout ("2+4" layout) with respect to the "3+4" layout.

### Conclusion on the EM Calorimeter Performance

The impact of the reduced layouts on the EM calorimeter performance is small but visible, and can be summarised as follows. The low-energy tails for electrons of \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\)=10 GeV at \(\eta\)=1.2 decrease by about 15%. The "2+4" layout would provide a gain of 3% in the significance of the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel and of up to 4% in the significance of the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma Z\mathrm{Z}^{*}\rightarrow\mathrm{4e}\) channel. The "3+3" layout would provide no improvement for the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel, but would provide a gain of up to 2% in the significance of the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma Z\mathrm{Z}^{*}\rightarrow\mathrm{4e}\) channel.

## 6 Conclusions

In conclusion, it has been shown that both reduced layouts, while giving a slightly better EM calorimeter performance, give a significantly degraded Inner Detector performance compared to the baseline layout, for b-tagging (including Higgs searches, top and SUSY physics), Level-2 triggering and \(\mathrm{K^{0}_{\mathrm{g}}}\) reconstruction. In particular, the significance of the WH channel, already marginal, is reduced even further. As shown here, there will be serious degradations in the ID performance arising from the inevitable effects of reduced detector efficiency and pile-up. The Inner Detector Community believes that it is highly undesirable to incur additional and avoidable degradations arising from a reduced layout. The impact on the calorimeter performance is being addressed by seeking reductions in passive material, rather than in sensitive elements. The layout with 7 precision layers will give the best overall performance for ATLAS; it is therefore recommended to keep it as the baseline layout.
