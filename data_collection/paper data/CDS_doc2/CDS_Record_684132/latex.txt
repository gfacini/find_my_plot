The observation potential of the decay \(\rm{B^{+}\to K^{+}K^{+}\pi^{-}}\) with the ATLAS detector at LHC is described in this paper. In the Standard Model this decay mode is highly suppressed, while in models beyond the Standard Model it could be significantly enhanced. To improve the selection of the \(\rm{K^{+}K^{+}\pi^{-}}\) final state, a novel selection criterium based on Time-over-Threshold measurements in the Transition Radiation Tracker was implemented.

## 1 Introduction

Many B-meson decays have been considered for observing effects originating from physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). For instance, Flavour Changing Neutral Currents (FNCN) processes such as \(\mathrm{b\to s\gamma}\) have been analyzed, but theoretical uncertainties hamper the observation of new physics signatures [1, 2]. Channels such as \(\mathrm{b\to sq\bar{q}}\)[3] and \(\mathrm{b\to s\bar{l}}\)[4] also suffer from large theoretical uncertainties. Other processes such as \(\mathrm{B\to\tau}\) have been shown to be rather insensitive to a large class of new physics models [5].

New physics can be probed efficiently with the study of decays with extremely tiny branching ratio predicted by the Standard Model. The \(\mathrm{B^{\pm}\to K^{\pm}K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}}\) is a decay mode which is strongly suppressed in the SM. This decay can be produced in the SM by box diagrams (see Fig. 1a) with an estimated branching ratio at a level lower than \(10^{-11}\). The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) introduces squark-gaugino (or higgsino) box diagrams (see Fig. 1b), raising the estimated branching ratio to \(10^{-7}\sim 10^{-8}\)[6]. Supersymmetry with broken R parity provides a model with a significant enhancement of this decay as well (see Fig. 1c). The decay has also been studied in several Two Higgs Doublet Models that could lead to a branching ratio at the level of \(10^{-7}\)[7].

Recently an upper limit of \(8.79\times 10^{-5}\) has been set by the OPAL collaboration for the branching ratio \(\mathrm{BR(B^{\pm}\to K^{\pm}K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp})}\) at 90% confidence level [8].

## 2 Event simulation

The \(\mathrm{B^{+}\to K^{+}K^{+}\pi^{-}}\) decay was implemented in the Monte Carlo program Pythia5.7 [9] in order to generate the signal sample, using the ATLAS B

physics event generation framework 1. In the event generation, b-quark pairs were produced either directly via the lowest order process, or via gluon splitting or flavour excitation.

Footnote 1: [http://msmizans.home.cern.ch/msmizans/production/0.html](http://msmizans.home.cern.ch/msmizans/production/0.html)

Events containing a B\({}^{+}\) meson were selected, and then the B\({}^{+}\) was forced to decay into a K\({}^{+}\)K\({}^{+}\pi^{-}\) final state. The associated \(\bar{\rm b}\) was forced to decay semileptonically into \(\mu\)X, in order to satify the level-1 trigger requirements for B-physics (a muon with a \(p_{\rm T}>\) 6 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.4\)).

The second level trigger for this hadronic B decay could be envisaged to be the presence of three charged particles with \(p_{\rm T}>1.5\) GeV, forming an invariant mass close to the B-meson mass. The detailed trigger rates have not yet been studied.

## 3 Fast simulation parameterisation

For this feasibility study, a fast simulation program was used instead of a full GEANT simulation.

The parametrisation was established by studying in detail the resolutions of the five helix parameters of the tracks in fully-simulated samples, including tails ([10],[11]). The smeared five helix parameters of the track and the corresponding covariance matrix were obtained, and a look-up table as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\) was produced. The parametrisation was then applied to the four-momenta of the generated particles. In case of pions, the parametrisation included a dependence on the decay radius as well, in order to be able to describe pions coming from the decay of long lifetime particles such as K\({}^{0}_{\rm S}\).

The parametrisation handles differently muons, electrons and hadrons. Muon resolutions in fully simulated samples did not show appreciable tails and so they were parametrised with Gaussian functions as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\). Electron resolutions, on the contrary, showed a non-Gaussian behaviour which is due to interactions with the Inner Detector material. To take this effect into account, electron distributions were parametrised allowing for a single hard bremsstrahlung, chosen at random from the appropriate distribution.

The parametrisation for pions was established by studying the resolutions of the five track parameters in fully-simulated samples. The total sample was divided into bins of \(p_{\rm T}\), \(\eta\) and decay radius \(R\) in order to be able to describe also pions from decays of long lifetime particles. In each bin, the track parameter resolutions were described as the sum of two Gaussians in order to take into account the presence of tails. This method allows for obtaining a parametrisation of the full covariance matrix (including the correlation terms) as a function of \(p_{T}\), \(\eta\) and R. This parametrisation was used to smear the five generated pion-track parameters in the fast-simulation program.

## 4 Hadron identification

Efficient separation between kaons, protons and pions is obviously important for many aspects of B-physics studies in the ATLAS experiment [12]. Earlier Monte Carlo studies of K/\(\pi\) separation using signal shape information from the ATLAS TRT are reported in [13].

Recent test-beam data and detailed Monte Carlo simulation show that a time-over-threshold method allows for an improved hadron identification, assuming that the TRT read-out would also provide the time of the trailing edge at low luminosity while preserving the output bandwidth requirements. The time-over-threshold method is described in detail in [14].

The time-over-threshold (ToT) for a single straw is defined as the width of the signal at the output of the low-threshold discriminator in the TRT front-end electronics, as illustrated in Fig. 2. The ToT provides partial information on the particle energy loss in the straw gas, assuming that its dependence on the distance of closest approach of the track to the straw anode has been taken into account.

The energy loss estimator (\(<\Delta_{ToT}>\)) is built on the basis of the individual ToT for all the straw hits on a given particle track, according to

Figure 2: Dependence of the time-over-threshold on the track distance, \(y\), from the wire. The straw signal is shown before and after the low-threshold (200 eV) discrimination.

the procedure described in [14]. In the TRT, on average, 35 straws will be crossed by particle tracks with \(p_{\rm T}>0.5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). The expected \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\) response for pions, kaons and protons was studied in detail by using the full simulation (based on GEANT 3.21) of single particles without pile-up and with the overall straw response tuned to test-beam data. The expected \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\) distributions for reconstructed tracks in the ATLAS barrel TRT at \(|\eta|=0.3\) are shown in Fig. 3 for 5 GeV pions and kaons. The expected K/\(\pi\) separation as a function of energy is shown in Fig. 4 in units of standard deviation. Without including any pile-up effects, the K/\(\pi\) separation is predicted to be above one standard deviation for transverse momenta between 2 and 5 GeV, averaged over the full rapidity coverage (solid line), and above one standard deviation over a broader \(p_{\rm T}\)-range between 2 and 15 GeV at \(|\eta|=0.3\) (dotted line).

In order to study real physics processes in the ATLAS experiment, the mean and the sigma of the \(<\Delta_{ToT}>\) distributions, well described by gaussians, were parameterised as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\) over the full acceptance region of the ATLAS TRT. The comparison between the mean of the \(dE/dx\) distribution for pions, kaons and protons as a function of \(\eta\) is shown in Fig. 5 for \(p_{\rm T}\)=10 GeV particles, while the corresponding distributions for the sigma are shown in Fig. 6.

Both the mean and the sigma of the \(dE/dx\) distribution have been pa Figure 5: Parameterisation of the mean of the \(dE/dx\) distribution as a function of \(\eta\) for \(p_{\rm T}\)=10 GeV pions, kaons and protons (shown in order of decreasing average mean).

The coefficients of this straight line fit, namely the intercept (\(a_{0}^{p_{T}}\)) and the slope (\(a_{0}^{p_{T}}\)), have then been parameterised as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\), as shown for the kaons in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. Linear interpolation was used for this latter parametrisation.

## 5 Analysis

### Event selection

The event selection cuts are summarised in Table 1. The cuts on the transverse momentum of the particles and the loose cut on the B-candidate mass emulate the second-level trigger requirements. The other selection criteria are based on the quality of the B-vertex fit, on the long lifetime of the B meson (the reconstructed B vertex is required to be separated from the primary vertex with at least 100 \(\mu\)m in the transverse plane), on the rejection of events in which two of the particle pairs form masses close to light resonance masses, and on the probability that the three particles form a KK\(\pi\) combination. The last selection criterium is explained in more detail in Section 5.2. The resolution of the decay length in the transverse plane is 72 \(\mu\)m. All cuts are applied in sequence.

The overall signal efficiency was found to be 11.6%, while the background effiency was \(2.8\cdot 10^{-4}\) %. The study of the background rejection was limited by the statistics of the simulated background sample (one million \({\rm b\bar{b}}\to\mu 6\)X events, where \(\mu 6\) denotes the level-1 trigger requirements for the muon).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c||c||} \hline Cuts & Signal efficiency & Background efficiency \\ \hline \(p_{T}\)(tracks) \(>1.5\) GeV & 50.9\% & 68.8\% \\ \hline \(4\) GeV \(<\) M(B) \(<6\) GeV & 97.7\% & 53.1\% \\ \hline \(\chi^{2}\)(triplet vertex fit) \(<2\) & 83.6\% & 68.4\% \\ \hline \(p_{\rm T}\)(B) \(>10\) GeV & 80.1\% & 22.6\% \\ \hline Vertex detachment \(>0.1\)mm & 58.33\% & 0.3\% \\ \hline \({\cal P}(dE/dx)>0.1\) & 87.8\% & 76.3\% \\ \hline Dalitz, \(m_{13}^{2}\) and \(m_{23}^{2}\)\(>2.5\) GeV & 74.4\% & 35.9\% \\ \hline \(5.16\) GeV \(<\) M(B) \(<5.45\) GeV & 91.2\% & 5.8\% \\ \hline \hline Overall & 11.6\% & \(2.8\cdot 10^{-4}\) \% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

### Use of the \(dE/dx\) information

The selection criteria discussed in Section 5.1, reduce the background by six orders of magnitude, while preserving about 12% of the signal, as it is shown in Table 1. In this section, the use of the \(dE/dx\) information is explained in detail.

Using the fast simulation, the detector read-out information is not available. The knowledge of the particle identity is therefore essential in order to simulate the detector \(dE/dx\) response to charged particle tracks. For a track with given \(p_{\rm T}\) and \(\eta\), the so-called \(dE/dx_{actual}\), which in the full simulation would be the \(dE/dx\) as measured by the detector, was simulated using the sigma and the mean provided by the parameterisation, described in Section 4, according to equation (5.1).

\[\frac{dE}{dx}\Big{|}_{actual}=\rm{mean}+\rm{rnd}*\sigma \tag{5.1}\]

where RND is a gaussianly distributed pseudo-random number.

For any given triplet of particles, two positive and one negative -- candidates to be the decay products of the \(B^{+}\) -- the \(\chi^{2}\) distribution was constructed according to formula (5.2):

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{3}\left[\frac{\frac{dE}{dx}\big{|}_{exp}-\frac{dE_{i}}{dx} \big{|}_{act}}{\sigma_{i}}\right]^{2} \tag{5.2}\]

where the index \(i\) labels the individual particles in the triplet and \(dE/dx_{exp}\) (the expectation for the signal hypotesis) is given by the mean value of the \(dE/dx\) distribution for pions (if the track has negative curvature) or for kaons (if the track has positive curvature). The \(\chi^{2}\) probability for three degrees of freedom is then calculated. The \(\chi^{2}\) probability is constructed to be flat for the signal (as expected from equation (5.2)), while for the background it is peaked towards lower probability values, as is shown in Fig. 9. The background misidentification probability as a function of the signal efficiency is shown in Fig. 10 for the \(dE/dx\)\(\chi^{2}\) probability after the proposed second level trigger (see Section 2).

### Results

The number of signal events produced during one year of running at low luminosity at the LHC can be estimated as follows:

\[N^{\rm{prod}}_{\rm{signal}}=\sigma(\rm{pp}\to b\bar{b}\to\mu 6X)\times{ \cal B}r(b\to B^{+})\times{\cal B}r(B^{+}\to K^{+}K^{+}\pi^{-})\times{\cal L }\times T \tag{5.3}\]and

\[N^{\rm obs}_{\rm signal}={\rm N}^{\rm prod}_{\rm signal}\times\epsilon_{\rm reconstruction }\times\epsilon_{\rm identification} \tag{5.4}\]

where

* \(\sigma({\rm pp}\rightarrow{\rm b}\bar{{\rm b}}\rightarrow\mu 6{\rm X})=2.3\mu{\rm b}\)
* \({\cal B}r({\rm b}\rightarrow{\rm B}^{+})=39.7\%\)
* \({\cal B}r({\rm B}^{+}\rightarrow{\rm K}^{+}{\rm K}^{+}\pi^{-})=10^{-7}({\rm assumed})\)
* \({\cal L}=10^{33}{\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}\)
* \(T=10^{7}{\rm s}\) for one year of running.
* \(\epsilon_{\rm reconstruction}=11.6\%\)
* \(\epsilon_{\rm identification}(\mu 6)=0.85\)
* \(\epsilon_{\rm identification}(\pi,{\rm K})=0.90\)

The number of produced signal events per year is thus \(N^{\rm prod}_{\rm signal}=913\), and the number of observed events is \(N^{\rm obs}_{\rm signal}=65\).

The number of background events produced during one year of running at low luminosity at the LHC can be estimated as follows:

\[N^{\rm prod}_{\rm back}=\sigma({\rm pp}\rightarrow{\rm b}\bar{{\rm b}} \rightarrow\mu 6{\rm X})\times{\cal L}\times{\rm T} \tag{5.5}\]The number of produced background events is thus \(\rm N_{bg}^{\rm prod}=2.3\times 10^{10}\). Using \(\epsilon_{\rm reconstruction}=2.8\;10^{-4}\%\) and \(\epsilon_{\rm identification}(\mu 6)=0.85\), \(\epsilon_{\rm identification}(\pi,{\rm K})=0.90\), the number of observed background events is \(\rm N_{bg}^{\rm obs}=4\times 10^{4}\).

Assuming \({\cal B}r({\rm B}^{+}\rightarrow{\rm K}^{+}{\rm K}^{+}\pi^{-})=1\times 10^{-7}\), the signal significance after one year of running is \(S/\sqrt{B}=0.3\) and after three years it is \(S/\sqrt{B}=0.6\). If one requires signal significance of three standard deviations (\(S/\sqrt{B}=3\)), an upper limit of the branching ratio of the signal is

\({\cal B}r({\rm B}^{+}\rightarrow{\rm K}^{+}{\rm K}^{+}\pi^{-})=5.3\times 10^{-7}\)

after three years of data-taking at the low luminosity.

## 6 Summary

The analysis of the \({\rm B}^{+}\rightarrow{\rm K}^{+}{\rm K}^{+}\pi^{-}\) decay with the ATLAS detector permits to set a new upper limit on its branching ratio, which is lower by more than two orders of magnitude with respect to the present estimate. For this analysis, a novel selection criterium based on Time-over-Threshold measurements in the Transition Radiation Tracker has been applied.

In the case of SUSY scenarios this decay could be seen with the ATLAS detector. In R-parity violating models, in particular, branching ratios as large as \(10^{-4}\) can be attained. In these frameworks, ATLAS could contribute in the measurements of some of the bounds, like \(\lambda\), on the R-parity violating couplings.
