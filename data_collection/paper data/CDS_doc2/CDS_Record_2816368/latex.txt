**Dark matter summary plots for \(s\)-channel, 2HDM+\(a\) and Dark Higgs models**

The ATLAS Collaboration

This is an update of summary plots from the Exotics, SUSY, HDBS and Higgs working groups, via the CDM sub-group, for dark matter simplified models with \(s\)-channel Spin-1 and Spin-0 mediators, a Two-Higgs-Doublet model with an extra pseudoscalar mediator (2HDM+\(a\)) and a Dark Higgs model. Results shown are current as of July 2022.

## 1 Introduction

This document provides updated summary plots of mediator-based dark matter models, including \(s\)-channel models [1], a 2HDM+\(a\) model [2] and a Dark Higgs model [3] using results current as of July 2022. Results for \(s\)-channel models are discussed in Section 2. The 2HDM+\(a\) model is discussed in Section 3. The Dark Higgs model is discussed in Section 4.

## 2 \(s\)-channel summary plots

Spin-1 mediators are discussed in Section 2.1 and spin-0 mediators are discussed in Section 2.2.

### Spin-1 Mediators

With respect to the summary results for spin-1 mediators released in December 2021 for the Moriond 2022 conferences [4], no major modifications have been made. The search for dark matter in association with a leptonically decaying \(Z\) boson, denoted \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+Z(\ell^{+}\ell^{-})\) has been published in [5] so the corresponding reference in each plot has been updated. This modification appears in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 5, Figure 6, Figure 9, Figure 10 and Figure 13.

Figure 1: Regions in the (mediator-mass, DM-mass) plane excluded at 95% CL by visible and invisible searches, for leptophobic axial-vector mediator simplified models. Each shaded region represents the union of the exclusion contours of the individual analyses listed in the legend, where more than one result contributes. The exclusions are computed for a DM coupling \(g_{x}=1\), quark coupling \(g_{q}=0.25\), universal to all flavours, and no coupling to leptons. Dashed curves labelled “thermal relic” correspond to combinations of DM and mediator mass values that are consistent with a DM density of \(\Omega h^{2}=0.12\) and a standard thermal history, as computed in MadDM [Phys. Dark Univ. **26** (2019) 100377, AIP Conf. Proc. **1743** (2016) 1, 060001]. Between the two curves, annihilation processes described by the simplified model deplete \(\Omega h^{2}\) to below 0.12. A dotted line indicates the kinematic threshold where the mediator can decay on-shell into DM. Excluded regions that are in tension with the perturbative unitary considerations of [JHEP **02** (2016) 016] are indicated by shading in the upper left corner. The reinterpretation procedure for the TLA analysis follows the procedure recommended by ATLAS in Appendix A of [Phys. Rev. D **91** (2015) 052007], while the high-mass dijet and dijet+ISR analyses are reinterpreted following [Phys. Lett. B **769** (2017) 520].

Figure 15: Hadronic resonance search contours for 95% CL upper limits on the coupling \(g_{q}\) as a function of the resonance mass \(m_{Z^{\prime}_{A}}\) for the leptophilic axial-vector mediator simplified model. The expected limits from each search are indicated by dotted lines. The TLA dijet analysis has two parts, employing different datasets with different selections in the rapidity difference \(y^{*}\) as indicated. The dijet+ISR (\(\gamma\)) analysis also has two parts, each using a different trigger strategy, and each further studied in inclusive and \(b\)-tagged channels. Two lines are also shown for the di-\(b\)-jet search. These are from separate analyses, one which used \(b\)-jet triggers and provides the limit at lower mass, and one which used inclusive jet triggers and provides the high mass limit. Coupling values above the solid lines are excluded, as long as the signals are narrow enough to be detected using these searches. The TLA dijet search with \(|y^{*}|<0.6\) is sensitive up to \(\Gamma/m_{Z^{\prime}}=7\%\), the TLA dijet with \(|y^{*}|<0.3\) and dijet + ISR searches are sensitive up to \(\Gamma/m_{Z^{\prime}}=10\%\), and the dijet and di-\(b\)-jet searches are sensitive up to \(\Gamma/m_{Z^{\prime}}=15\%\). The dijet angular analysis is sensitive up to \(\Gamma/m_{Z^{\prime}}=50\%\). No limitation in sensitivity arises from large width resonances in the \(t\bar{t}\) resonance analysis. Benchmark width lines are indicated in the canvas. \(\Gamma/m_{Z^{\prime}}=50\%\) lies beyond the canvas borders.

### Spin-0 Mediators

This section provides dark matter summary plots from analyses targetting exotic and supersymmetric signal models. This section refers to a signal model which includes a Dirac fermion dark matter candidate, \(\chi\), and a new spin-zero particle, \(\phi(a)\), which couples to Dark Matter and quarks with a new spin-zero scalar (pseudoscalar) particle [1, 6, 7]. Assuming minimal flavour violation [8], the model assumes a Yukawa-like structure of the couplings of the new mediator to the SM particles, which include a common coupling \(g_{q}\). The additional free parameters of the model are the masses of the Dark Matter \(m_{\chi}\), the mediator particles \(m_{\phi}/m_{a}\), and the coupling strength of the interactions between the mediator particle and Dark Matter particles \(g_{\chi}\).

A more detailed description of the models considered in Figures 16 and 17 is now presented:

_Model 1_: considers scalar and pseudoscalar mediators produced in association with a pair of bottom quarks (DMbb). The production cross-sections for these models were evaluated including NLO QCD corrections assuming SM Yukawa couplings to quarks, in a five-flavour scheme, following Ref. [9]. _Model 2_: Scalar and pseudoscalar signal samples were simulated in PowhegBox[10, 11, 12] using a simplified model implementation described in Ref. [13]. The DMS_tloop model was used for the production with \(s\)-channel spin-0 scalar and pseudoscalar mediator exchange with the full quark-loop calculation at LO [14]. _Model 3_: considers scalar and pseudoscalar mediators produced in association with a pair of top quarks (DMtt) and, in addition, single top quark production referred as DMt. Both productions use _DMsimp_ implementation [15]. Signal samples for DMtt are generated using a LO matrix element, with up to one extra parton using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[16] generator interfaced to Pythia and using the CKKW-L merging algorithm [17]. The top quark decay is simulated using MadSpin[18]. Signal cross sections for the DMtt process are calculated to NLO QCD accuracy using the same version of MadGraph, as suggested in Ref. [15]. Signal samples for dark matter associated production with a single top quark are generated using the same settings as the DMtt. No extra partons from the matrix element are generated in this case. DMt signal models are generated separately for \(tW\) and the \(tj\) processes. Each one is normalised to the LO cross section predicted by the model and then the samples are combined (added together).

With respect to the summary results for spin-0 mediators released for Moriond 2022 [4], new analyses have been released publicly and are described in detail below:

\(\mathbf{b\bar{b}+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}0L}\)**:**: The full Run 2 results is included in the current document [19]. No modification has been made for this analysis result. This analysis uses _Model 1_.
**Monojet:**: The full Run 2 result for the jets\(+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) analysis [20] were previously included but only presented for the pseudoscalar interpretation. This analysis uses _Model 2_.
**\(\mathbf{t\bar{t}+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}}\)Combination:**: Previously, results were presented for different leptonic final states explicitly [21, 22, 23]. A new result [24] is now included, consisting of a statistical combination of three searches targeting events with two top quarks and invisible particles considering either zero- (tt0L [25]), one- (tt1L [22]) or two-lepton (tt2L [23]) final states. The tt0L analysis is extended and improved with respect to Ref. [25] benefitting from the Run-2 improvements in the trigger selection of jets containing \(b\)-hadrons (\(b\)-jets) in ATLAS [26] that increases the sensitivity in models with light mediator masses. These three analyses select independent (orthogonal) datasets and their statisticalcombination boosts the sensitivity as they constrain similar parts of the parameter space. This analysis uses _Model 3_.

\(tj+E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}1\text{L}\)**, \(tW+E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}1\text{L}\)**, \(tW+E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}2\text{L}\)**. These three analysis selections were developed in the context of the 2HDM+\(a\) model as a search for single top quarks produced in association with DM candidates [27]. These analysis selections use _Model 3_.

The updated summaries are presented in Figures 16, and 17.

Figure 16: Exclusion limits for colour-neutral pseudoscalar mediator dark matter models [Phys. Dark Univ. **26** (2019) 100371] as a function of the mediator mass \(m_{a}\) for a dark matter mass \(m_{\chi}\) of 1 GeV. The limits are calculated at 95% CL and are expressed in terms of the ratio of the excluded cross-section to the nominal cross-section for a coupling assumption of \(g_{q}=g_{\chi}=1\). The solid (dashed) lines show the observed (expected) exclusion limits for different analyses. The \(b\bar{b}+E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)OL analysis considers the DMbb signal model. The \(t\bar{t}+E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) combination, \(tj+E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)1L, \(tW+E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)1L and \(tW+E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)2L analyses consider DMtt and DMt signal models. Signal cross-sections for the DMtt process are calculated to NLO QCD accuracy while the DMt process is calculated to LO accuracy. The monojet analysis considers the \(j+a\) signal model.

## 3 2HDM+_a_ summary plots

This section provide the 2HDM+_a_[2] summary plots. With respect to the results released for the Moriond 2022 conference [4], only one reference to a public result has been updated:

\(\mathbf{E}_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}+\mathbf{Z}(\ell^{+}\ell^{-})\)  : Shown with the paper publication reference ( Ref. [5] replacing [arXiv:2111.08372]).

### Overview of parameter scans

The following parameter scans released in Ref. [28] are included:

* **Scan 1**: two 2D scans in \((m_{a},m_{A})\) assuming \(\tan\beta\ =1.0\) and 1. \(\sin\theta=0.35\) 2. \(\sin\theta=0.7\).
* **Scan 2**: two 2D scans in \((m_{A},\tan\beta\ )\) assuming \(m_{a}=250\) GeV and 1. \(\sin\theta=0.35\) 2. \(\sin\theta=0.7\).
* **Scan 3**: two 2D scans in \((m_{a},\tan\beta\ )\) assuming \(m_{A}=0.6\) TeV and 1. \(\sin\theta=0.35\) 2. \(\sin\theta=0.7\).
* **Scan 4**: two 1D scans in \(\sin\theta\) with \(\tan\beta\ =1.0\) and 1. \(m_{A}=0.6\) TeV, \(m_{a}=200\) GeV (low-mass scan) 2. \(m_{A}=1\) TeV, \(m_{a}=350\) GeV (high-mass scan)
* **Scan 5**: a 1D scan in \(m_{\chi}\) assuming \(m_{A}=0.6\) TeV, \(m_{a}=250\) GeV, \(\tan\beta\ =1.0\) and \(\sin\theta=0.35\).

In all scans other than the DM mass scan, \(m_{\chi}=10\) GeV is chosen. The choice of \(m_{\chi}\) has a negligible impact on the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)+X signatures for \(m_{a}>2m_{\chi}\). The chosen value ensures a sizeable branching ratio for the decay \(a\to\chi\tilde{\chi}\) for all values of \(m_{a}>100\) GeV that are considered in this note.

### Results

#### \(m_{A}\)-\(m_{a}\) scan

Figure 18: Observed (solid lines) and expected (dashed lines) exclusion regions at 95% CL in the \((m_{a},m_{A})\) plane under the assumption of (a) \(\sin\theta=0.35\) (scan 1a) and (b) \(\sin\theta=0.7\) (scan 1b). The results are shown for several individual searches as well as the combination of the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}+Z(\ell^{\prime}\ell^{-})\) and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}+h(b\bar{b})\) searches. The dashed grey regions indicate the region where the width of any of the Higgs bosons exceeds 20% of its mass. The larger exclusions of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}+h(b\bar{b})\) and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}+h(\gamma\gamma)\) in high \(m_{A}\) region are due to an increase of the cross section of the \(a\to a\,h\) process, which are more significant when \(\sin\theta=0.7\). The observed exclusion of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}+Wt\) search is weaker than the expected sensitivity due to a small (within \(2\sigma\)) excess in the \(tW_{\rm 2L}\) region [27]. Thus in Figure 18(a), no observed exclusion is shown in the parameter space.

## 6 Conclusions

Figure 22: Observed (solid lines) and expected (dashed lines) exclusion limits for the 2HDM+\(a\) model as a function of \(m_{\chi}\), following the parameter choices of \(m_{A}=0.6\) TeV, \(m_{a}=250\) GeV, \(\tan\beta\ =1.0\) and \(\sin\theta=0.35\) (scan 5). The limits are calculated at 95% CL and are expressed in terms of the ratio of the excluded cross section to the nominal cross section of the model. The results are shown for several individual searches as well as the combination of the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) + \(Z(\ell^{+}\ell^{-})\) and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) + \(h(b\,\bar{b})\) searches. The relic density for each \(m_{\chi}\) assumption is superimposed in the plot (long-dashed line) and described by the right vertical axis. For dark matter mass values where the relic density line is below \(\Omega h^{2}=0.12\), the model depletes the relic density to below the thermal value. The two valleys at \(m_{\chi}=125\) GeV and \(m_{\chi}=300\) GeV determine the two \(a\)-funnel and \(A\)-funnel regions [29, 30, 2] where the predicted relic density is depleted by the resonant enhancement of the processes \(\chi\bar{\chi}\to A/a\to{\rm SM}\). The shaded region around 125 GeV indicates a \(\pm 5\) GeV band around the kinematic thresholds \(m_{\chi}=m_{a}/2\) and \(m_{\chi}=m_{A}/2\) where the generator results are deemed unreliable. The interpolation of the exclusion limit for the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) + \(h\) and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) + \(Z\) searches in the region 125-150 GeV in \(m_{\chi}\) is subject to large uncertainties due to the rapidly changing cross sections in this region.

## 4 Dark Higgs summary plot

This section provides a new summary plot from analyses targetting the Dark Higgs Model [3]. This signal model provides a Majorana fermion dark matter candidate \(\chi\) and two mediators: a vector boson \(Z^{\prime}\) and a scalar dark Higgs boson \(s\). The dark Higgs boson does not couple to SM particles, but can decay via mixing with the SM Higgs boson and hence has SM-like branching fractions as long as there are no new decay channels. The additional free parameters of this model are the masses of the Dark Matter \(m_{\chi}\), the mediator particles \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\) and \(m_{s}\), the \(Z^{\prime}\) coupling strength to quarks \(q_{q}\) and to DM \(g_{\chi}\), and the mixing angle \(\theta\) between the SM and dark Higgs bosons.

### Parameter scan

The following parameter scan has been added:

* **Scan1**: a scan in \((m_{Z^{\prime}},m_{s})\) assuming \(g_{q}=0.25\), \(g_{\chi}=1\), \(\sin\theta=0.01\), \(m_{\chi}=200\) GeV. This scan is shown in Figure 23.

Figure 23: Observed (solid lines) and expected (dotted lines) exclusion limits at 95% CL for the Dark Higgs model in the \((m_{Z^{\prime}},m_{s})\) plane under the assumption of \(g_{q}=0.25\), \(g_{\chi}=1\), \(\sin\theta=0.01\), \(m_{\chi}=200\) GeV. The open contours indicates regions of the mass plane not explored for that particular signature. The coloured areas are excluded. The dashed curve corresponds to the combinations of parameter values that are consistent with a DM density of \(\Omega h^{2}=0.12\) and a standard thermal history, as computed in MadDM [Phys. Dark Univ. **26** (2019) 100377, AIP Conf. Proc. **1743** (2016) 1, 060001], with the diagonal lines indicating which side corresponds to an overabundance of DM.
