**Abstract**

Charge, fired strip multiplicity and arrival time distributions for the induced signal were investigated for the \(2\ mm\) gap RPC operating with several tetrafluoroethane (\(C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}\)) based mixtures with variation of isobutane (\(iC_{4}H_{10}\)) and sulphur hexafluoride (\(SF_{6}\)) concentrations.

Suppression of the large fast charges for the mixtures containing \(SF_{6}\) in comparison with the binary \(C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}/iC_{4}H_{10}\) mixture was confirmed. This suppression allows to have a wide plateau region (\(\geq 1\ kV\)) with small average charge and reduced tail of high charges.

Exclusion of isobutane from the mixture with 2% of \(SF_{6}\) does not change charge distributions.

Introduction

A few years ago the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) were proposed as muon trigger detectors which should work in high rate environment [1, 2]. Possibility for high rate RPC operation is defined mainly by the amount of charge produced in the gas gap by the going through charged particle. It is very attractive to have the RPC working mode characterized by the weak gas gain dependence on the applied voltage which can provide approximately the same charge distributions with small average charges and low probability of large charge appearance in a wide HV plateau range. Small values of the average charge provide a low recovery time and the absence of tail with large charges allows to reduce a contribution from high pick-up strip multiplicities. It is desirable to have an average charge at the level of a few \(pC\) as it is seen for avalanche fraction of charge distributions for the binary tetrafluoroethane(TFE)/isobutane(IB) mixtures in the streamer region [3]. It would be an ideal mode of the RPC operation at high rate environment and we call it as "saturated avalanche" mode.

In the last years intensive attempts were made to find such a mode of the RPC operation. Recently it has been shown that this regime is feasible using the proper gas mixtures [4, 5]. It was indicated that the addition of a few percent of sulphur hexafluoride, \(SF_{6}\), to the binary TFE/IB mixture allows to reduce the average fast charge and high charge tail of the charge distribution in the discharge process for a wide plateau region.

Here we have tried to investigate this question with our own approach using several TFE (\(C_{2}H_{2}F_{4}\)) based mixtures with variation of IB (\(iC_{4}H_{10}\)) and \(SF_{6}\) concentrations.

**2 Experimental set-up**

Measurements were made during the December-98 and April-99 runs at the test facility of the IHEP U-70 accelerator in the low momentum (a few \(GeV\)) beam of positive particles, mostly hadrons. The experimental set-up is shown on Fig. 1a.

Trigger was worked out by four-fold coincidence of scintillation counters \(S1-S4\) and picked out \(1.5(H)\times 4.0(V)\)\(cm^{2}\) area of the tested RPC. The veto scintillation counter \(V\) with 25 \(mm\) diameter hole was included to the trigger too. Trigger rate was at the level of 100 \(triggers/spill\) with spill time about 2 \(sec\). To measure precisely horizontal coordinate of triggered particles and remove in the off-line analysis multi particle events the scintillation fiber hodoscope \(HODO\) having \(10(H)\times 10(V)\)\(cm^{2}\) lateral size and 3 \(mm\) fibers, oriented vertically, was used. The test area had high irradiation background at the level of 100 \(Hz/cm^{2}\).

The RPC had one gas gap 2.1 \(mm\) wide with sensitive area \(0.5(H)\times 2.0(V)\)\(m^{2}\). The triggered particles hitted the centre of the sensitive area. Electrodes of the RPC were made from 1.6 \(mm\) thick phenol-melamine bakelite plates with \((1-3)\times 10^{12}\)\(\Omega\cdot cm\) volume resistivity. No additional treatment was applied to the inner surfaces of the gas gap. HV was spread over outer bakelite surfaces with graphite coating with about 50 \(k\Omega/square\) surface resistivity.

The chamber had X and Y read-out strip panels, strip width being 28 \(mm\) with 30 \(mm\) pitch. Two types of strip panels were used. First one was a usual strip panel. The second one had screening tiny strips 1 \(mm\) wide between usual sensitive strips These tiny strips were terminated with resistors equal to their measured impedance of 130 \(\Omega\). Only vertically oriented 2 \(m\) long strips were used for measurements. Comparison of the cross talks for these different strip panels is a matter of the forthcoming note.

The read-out scheme of our measurements is shown in Fig. 1b. For efficiency, singles rate and charge measurements only one strip was used usually. For charge measurements in avalanche region the commercial amplifier U3-33 with maximal amplification of 20 was used. The amplified signal was attenuated when it was needed to fit QDC range. QDC had sensitivity of 0.25 \(pC/count\) and gate width was varied from 100 to 500 \(ns\). Efficiency of picked out strip was obtained using a variable threshold discriminator and mostly corresponded to 0.3 \(mV\) threshold for induced signal.

For pick-up strip multiplicity and arrival time measurements, the 16-channel front-end electronic (FEE) boards with variable threshold were used. Each channel consisted of two stage amplifier and comparator. Outputs of FEE boards were fed to TDCs with about 0.7 \(ns\) binning. Other ends of all strips were terminated with resistors, equal to their characteristic impedance of 24 \(\Omega\), or connected to amplifiers for simultaneous charge measurements with QDCs. Both amplifiers and FEE boards had 50 \(\Omega\) inputs.

Charge data presented here refer to the total fast charge induced on the strip.

## 3 Experimental results.

From the practical point of view it is very desirable to have a 1 \(kV\) plateau region for the "saturated avalanche" mode of the RPC operation. Having such kind of RPC operation region one may choose the working point at 0.5 \(kV\) above the knee and possible plateau range of \(\pm 0.5kV\). If nominal HV is about 10 \(kV\) this corresponds roughly to \(\pm 5\%\) of the field strength variation that can provide soft requirements for electrode resistivity and gas gap width tolerances, possible drifts of these values with a time, ambient temperature and pressure variations and so on.

First of all the influence of the \(SF_{6}\) was studied. The value of the IB was fixed to be 3% and the concentration of \(SF_{6}\) was varied from 0% to 5%. The drastic change of charge distributions was found for the HV range above \(V_{knee}\) (the \(V_{knee}\) was defined as the point with the efficiency 98%). To illustrate and stress this effect Fig. 2 shows charge distributions for selected mixtures at value \(\triangle V=V-V_{knee}=1\ kV\). The transformation of charge distribution shapes with increasing \(SF_{6}\) amount is clearly seen. If for the binary TFE/IB mixture the well known distribution is observed with clear "streamer" peak well separated from the "avalanche" one, then for the mixtures containing \(SF_{6}\) there is an obvious tendency for merging of the "streamer" and "avalanche" parts of the charge distributions with increasing of the \(SF_{6}\) fraction. It seems that the "streamer" charge is moving to lower values and the "avalanche" part of the charge distribution becomes broader. Therefore there is no sense to study the "avalanche" and "streamer" charges separately.

Figure 3 shows the behaviour of the average total charge for these mixtures as a function of \(\triangle V\). For the binary TFE/IB=97/3 mixture the average "avalanche" charge is plotted also as a reference which shows minimal achievable charge deposition providing minimal recovery time. Above the knee the binary TFE/IB mixture retains its behaviour as in the "avalanche" region while the growth of \(<\)q\(>_{tot}\) for mixtures containing \(SF_{6}\) becomes slower and compatible with reference "avalanche" charge growth above the knee. The more \(SF_{6}\) concentration the longer \(<\)q\(>_{tot}\) keeps such behaviour. It is seen that such behaviour is practically saturated at 2% of \(SF_{6}\).

An universal behaviour of average charge as a function of \(\triangle V\) for different mixtures in the "avalanche" region (below knee) is clearly observed. It means that the IB and \(SF_{6}\) additions do not change significantly the dependence of the effective Townsend coefficient as a function of the field strength in comparison with the binary TFE/IB mixture.

Now it is interesting to clarify the real role of the IB addition which is the flammable gas in these gas mixtures. Therefore we have investigated this point separately. Figure 4 shows charge distributions for TFE/IB/\(SF_{6}\) = 93/5/2 and 98/0/2 mixtures at \(\triangle V=1\ kV\). Figure 5 shows the behaviour of average total charge for these mixtures as a function of \(\triangle V\). As one can see there is no significant difference between these two mixtures.

In Table 1 values of the \(V_{knee}\), average charges and average efficiencies above the knee are listed for all mixtures for some specific \(\triangle V\) points. If for the binary TFE/IB mixture drastic increasing of \(<\)q\(>_{tot}\)/\(<\)q\(>_{av}\) ratio from \(\sim 1\) at \(\triangle V=0.0\ kV\) to \(\sim 30\) at \(\triangle V=1\ kV\) is seen, for the 2% \(SF_{6}\) mixture this value is approximately constant at whole 1 \(kV\) plateau range and \(<\)q\(>_{tot}\) is only about 2 times higher than the reference \(<\)q\(>_{av}\) at \(\triangle V=1\ kV\)(see Table 1). It seems that good approximation for "saturated avalanche" mode is achieved.

As the first glance to understand the correlation between the shape of charge distributions and the pick-up strip multiplicity we have plotted the cumulative distribution

\[P(R_{0})=\int_{r\geq R_{0}}\rho(r)\cdot dr\ /\int_{r\geq 1}\rho(r)\cdot dr\]

as a function of \(r=q/q_{th}\) for fixed threshold charge \(q_{th}\). Here \(\rho(r)\) is charge distribution density and \(R_{0}=q_{0}/q_{th}\). This distribution shows probabilities to have a tail of the distribution with \(q>r\cdot q_{th}\).

Figure 6 shows these distributions for selected mixtures for \(\triangle V=-0.3,\ 0.0,\ 0.5\) and \(1.0\ kV\) at \(q_{th}=0.1\ pC\).

The data for \(\triangle V=-0.3\ kV\) show that the shapes of charge distributions are approximately the same for all mixtures in the avalanche region. It means that the universal behaviour observed for averages of charge distributions for different TFE mixtures as a function of \(\triangle V\) in the avalanche region is also valid for charge distributions them self.

For the plateau region (\(\triangle V\geq 0\ kV\)) it seems that for \(r\sim 10-20\) the distributions are the same. But for \(r\sim 100\) the mixtures containing \(SF_{6}\) give roughly 10 times better suppression compare with the binary TFE/IB mixture.

It is interesting to check these conclusions considering the real case - pick-up strip multiplicity per one through going particle. The value of

\[P(m)=\sum_{i\geq m}n_{i}/\sum_{i\geq 1}n_{i}\]

was measured as a function of \(m\) (see Fig. 7) for selected mixtures at different \(\triangle V\) values. Here \(n_{i}\) is the number of events with pick -up strip multiplicity i. Good agreement with the charge distributions behaviour is observed. The universal behaviour of P(m) for different TFE based mixtures is seen in the avalanche region for the whole range of multiplicities which reflects the observed universality of charge distributions. In the plateau region the behaviour of P(m) is the same for \(m\) up to 4. The tail of high multiplicities (streamer fraction) becomes larger and larger with increasing of \(\triangle V\) for the binary TFE/IB mixture and increases moderately for mixtures containing \(SF_{6}\). The proper \(SF_{6}\) admixture gives roughly one order of magnitude suppression for the tail of high multiplicity in comparison with the binary TFE/IB mixture.

Figure 8 shows the average pick-up strip multiplicity as a function of the \(\triangle V\) for selected mixtures for low (0.5  mV) and high (1.0  mV) FEE thresholds. As one can see the behaviour of these averages reflects expectations which were drawn for P(m) cumulative distributions. It is important to note for practical use that the high FEE threshold is

favourable for "saturated avalanche" mode of the RPC operation. It allows to reduce average cluster size by 0.5 unit for the plateau region.

Figure 9 shows arrival time distributions for induced signal from the main strip for selected mixtures at different \(\triangle V\) values. Decreasing of the time delay as a function of \(\triangle V\) is about 2 nsec/1 kV at the plateau region for all mixtures. Time resolutions for our RPC for all mixtures are at the level of 1 nsec. Thus in addition to the significant improvement of the charge and multiplicity characteristics of the RPC performance the \(SF_{6}\) addition does not worse its time properties.

## 4 Conclusions.

Addition of the electro-negative gas \(SF_{6}\) to the ordinary TFE/IB mixture allows to achieve good approach for "saturated avalanche" mode of the RPC operation, i.e. allows for the 1 \(kV\) wide plateau region

- to decrease the average fast charge ;

- to decrease the high pick-up strip multiplicity by an order of magnitude

in comparison with the binary TFE/IB mixture.

Our conclusions are in agreement with results reported in papers[4, 5].

The work in the "saturated avalanche" mode is suitable for application of the high FEE threshold (\(\sim 1\ mV\)) which is favourable for FEE performance.

There was observed no distinguished influence of the small amount of the IB on the charge properties of the 2% \(SF_{6}\) mixtures Therefore the IB can be excluded from the \(SF_{6}\) mixtures in sense of charge properties.

The universal behaviour of the charge distributions for all different TFE based mixtures as a function of \(\triangle V\) is observed in the avalanche region (below the knee). Thus the addition of \(SF_{6}\) does not change in general the process of the avalanche development except increasing of the applied voltage.
