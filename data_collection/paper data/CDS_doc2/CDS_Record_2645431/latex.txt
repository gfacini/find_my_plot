## 1 Introduction

Proton-proton collision data at low pile-up are of large interest for \(W\) boson physics, as the low detector occupancy allows an optimal reconstruction of missing transverse momentum, and the \(W\) production cross section is large enough to achieve small statistical uncertainties in a moderate running time. At \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and for an instantaneous luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}\sim 5\times 10^{32}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), corresponding to two collisions per bunch crossing on average at the LHC, about 2\(\times 10^{6}\) W boson events can be collected in one week. Such a sample provides a statistical sensitivity at the permille level for cross section measurements, at the percent level for measurements of the \(W\) boson transverse momentum distribution, and of about 10 MeV for a measurement of \(m_{W}\).

Additional potential is provided by the new tracking detector, the ITk [1], which extends the coverage in pseudorapidity beyond \(|\eta|<2.5\) to \(|\eta|<4\). The increased acceptance allows \(W\)-boson measurements to probe a new region in Bjorken \(x\) at \(Q^{2}\sim m_{W}^{2}\). This will in turn allow further constraints on the parton density functions (PDFs) from cross section measurements, and reduce PDF uncertainties in the measurement of \(m_{W}\). A possible increase of the LHC centre-of-mass energy, such as the HE-LHC program with \(\sqrt{s}=27\) TeV [2], could play a similar role.

This note presents a first quantitative study of this potential, focusing on the measurement of \(m_{W}\) and restricting the discussion to statistical and PDF uncertainties. Experimental systematic uncertainties are not discussed in this note; their effect is largely of statistical nature for the moderate size, low pile-up samples considered here, and with adequate efforts and exploiting the full available data sample, their impact can be maintained at a level similar to the statistical uncertainty. Theoretical uncertainties in the modelling of \(W\)-boson production, like the description of the boson transverse momentum distribution, will also be constrained by measurements using these data. However, PDF uncertainties do not scale simply and become dominant once sufficient data are collected, which motivates the present study.

PDF uncertainties and their correlations are studied as a function of the \(W\) boson charge, the decay lepton \(|\eta_{\ell}|\), and \(\sqrt{s}\); similar studies were presented in Refs. [3, 4]. Present-day PDF sets are considered as well as projected future sets representing the expected constraints from present and future \(pp\) data, and from the LHeC deep inelastic scattering project [5]. Section 2 summarizes the analysis steps, including event generation, a procedure to incorporate detector effects, and the expected sample after event selection; Section 3 summarizes the methodology and results. Conclusions are presented in Section 4.

## 2 Simulation and event selection

Leptonic \(W\) boson decays are characterized by an energetic, isolated electron or muon, and significant missing transverse momentum reflecting the decay neutrino. The hadronic recoil, \(u_{\mathrm{T}}\), is defined from the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all reconstructed particles in the event excluding the charged lepton, and provides a measure of the \(W\) boson transverse momentum. Lepton transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\), missing transverse momentum, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), and the hadronic recoil are related through \(\vec{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}=-(\vec{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}+\vec{u}_{ \mathrm{T}})\). The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions have sharp peaks at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\sim E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\sim m_{W}/2\). The transverse mass \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\), defined as \(m_{\mathrm{T}}=\sqrt{2p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}} \cos(\phi_{\ell}-\phi_{\mathrm{miss}})}\), peaks at \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\sim m_{W}\).

Events are generated at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) and 27 TeV using the W_EW_BMnnp process [6] of the Powheg event generator [7], with electroweak corrections switched off. The CT10 PDF set [8] is used, and parton showereffects are included using the Pythia event generator [9] with parameters set according to the AZNLO tune [10]. Final-state QED corrections are applied using Photos[11].

For a basic emulation of detector effects, the resolutions on the electron, muon and recoil reconstruction are parameterised as follows:

\[\sigma_{e}(E_{\ell}) = a(|\eta_{\ell}|)\sqrt{E_{\ell}}\oplus b(|\eta_{\ell}|)\oplus c(| \eta_{\ell}|)\cdot E_{\ell}, \tag{1}\] \[\sigma_{\mu}(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}) = r_{0}(|\eta_{\ell}|)\oplus r_{1}(|\eta_{\ell}|)\cdot p_{\mathrm{T }}^{\ell},\] (2) \[\sigma_{\mu\mathrm{T}}(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W},s) = q_{0}\cdot(s/s_{0})^{\alpha}+q_{1}\sqrt{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}}; \tag{3}\]

where \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) are the generator-level transverse momenta of the decay lepton and \(W\) boson, \(E_{\ell}\) the generator-level electron energy, and \(s\) the centre-of-mass energy squared. The calorimeter resolution parameters \(a\), \(b\) and \(c\), as well as the muon resolution parameters \(r_{0,1}\) are functions of the lepton pseudorapidity and taken from Refs. [12, 13], which describe the expected performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector.

During four weeks in 2017 and 2018, ATLAS recorded \(pp\) collision data at low pile-up and two centre-of-mass energies, \(\sqrt{s}=5\) and 13 TeV. The recoil resolution parameters are determined for this study using Monte Carlo samples of \(W\) boson events produced for the analysis of these data. The events were generated as described above, and passed through the full ATLAS simulation [14]. Pile-up is simulated using Pythia, and the average number of collisions per bunch crossing is set to \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 2\), matching the data taking conditions. The resolution parameters \(q_{0}\) and \(q_{1}\) are extracted from the behaviour of the recoil resolution as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) at both energies. The first term reflects the contribution from the underlying event activity; for a reference centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s_{0}}=5\) TeV, its parameters are found to be \(q_{0}=4.1\) GeV and \(\alpha=0.40\), yielding a resolution in \(\mu_{\mathrm{T}}\) of about 6.0 GeV at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, when \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}=0\). The second term is the contribution of the recoil jet, and its coefficient is determined to be \(q_{1}=0.23\), independently of energy. The simulated and parameterised recoil resolutions agree well for 5 and 13 TeV, as shown in Figure 1. The curves for the HL- and HE-LHC are obtained extrapolating this parameterisation to \(\sqrt{s}=14\) and 27 TeV, respectively.

Events are selected applying the following cuts to the object kinematics, after resolution corrections:

* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}>25\) GeV, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>25\) GeV, \(m_{\mathrm{T}}>50\) GeV and \(u_{\mathrm{T}}<15\) GeV;
* \(|\eta_{\ell}|<2.4\) or \(2.4<|\eta_{\ell}|<4\).

The first set of cuts select the range of the kinematic peaks of the \(W\) boson decay products, restricting to the region of small \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) to maximize the sensitivity of the distributions to \(m_{W}\). Two pseudorapidity ranges are considered, corresponding to the central region accessible with the current ATLAS detector, and to the forward region accessible in the electron channel with the ITk.

Signal cross sections, acceptance and the expected number of selected events are summarized in Table 1, accounting for typical electron and muon selection efficiencies. The cross sections are calculated at \(O(\alpha_{S})\) using Powheg; \(O(\alpha_{S}^{2})\) corrections would increase these numbers by 2 to 5% depending on the \(W\) boson charge and \(\sqrt{s}\). Small acceptance losses in the transition regions between the barrel, endcap and forward calorimeter systems are neglected.

The separation of \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) events for \(2.4<|\eta_{\ell}|<4\) relies on a sufficiently accurate measurement of the electron charge. Given the small polar angle and limited magnetic field integral in this region, a rate of charge mis-identification of about 5% is estimated near the detector boundary. While significantly higher than in central region of the detector, this rate can be accurately controlled using the high-statistics \(Z\to ee\) samples available from standard runs at the HL-LHC and does not significantly affect the PDF uncertainty estimates discussed in Section 3.

Distributions of the lepton transverse momentum and \(W\) boson transverse mass are shown in Figure 2 for selected events. In both cases, the detector effects are dominated by the recoil resolution. The difference between the predictions of the full simulation and the parameterised resolution is a few percent of that between the detector-level and generator-level distributions, indicating that the present approach is adequate for this analysis.

## 3 PDF uncertainties in \(m_{W}\)

The Monte Carlo samples are produced using the CT10 PDF set, \(m_{W}^{\rm ref}=80.399\) GeV, and the corresponding Standard Model prediction for \(\Gamma_{W}\). Kinematic distributions for the different values of \(m_{W}\) are obtained by

\end{table}
Table 1: Inclusive \(W\) boson production cross sections, signal acceptance and expected number of selected events at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) and \(27\) TeV. The cross sections correspond to a single decay lepton flavour. For \(|\eta_{\ell}|<2.4\), \(N_{\rm sel}\) corresponds to the sum of the electron and muon decay channels; for \(2.4<|\eta_{\ell}|<4\), only the electron channel is considered.

applying the following event weight to the reference samples:

\[w(m,m_{W},m_{W}^{\rm ref})=\frac{(m^{2}-{m_{W}^{\rm ref}}^{2})^{2}+m^{4}{\Gamma_{ W}^{\rm ref}}^{2}/m_{W}^{\rm ref}}{(m^{2}-m_{W}^{2})^{2}+m^{4}{\Gamma_{W}^{2}}/m_{W}^{2}}, \tag{4}\]

which represents the ratio of the Breit-Wigner densities corresponding to \(m_{W}\) and \(m_{W}^{\rm ref}\), for a given value of the final state invariant mass \(m\).

A similar event weight, calculated internally by Powheg and corresponding to the ratio of the event cross sections predicted by CT10 and several alternate PDFs, is used to obtain final state distributions corresponding to the CT14 [15], MMHT2014 [16], HL-LHC [17] and LHeC [18] PDF sets and their associated uncertainties. Compared to current sets such as CT14 and MMHT2014, the HL-LHC set incorporates the expected constraints from present and future LHC data; it starts from the PDF4LHC convention [19] and comes in three scenarios corresponding to more or less optimistic projections of the experimental uncertainties. The LHeC PDF set represents the impact of a proposed future high-energy, high-luminosity \(ep\) scattering experiment [5] on the uncertainties in the proton structure, using the theoretically best understood process for this purpose.

The shift in the measured value of \(m_{W}\) resulting from a change in the assumed PDF set is estimated as follows. Considering a set of template distributions obtained for different values of \(m_{W}\) and a given reference PDF set, and "pseudo-data" distributions obtained for \(m_{W}=m_{W}^{\rm ref}\) and an alternate set \(i\) (representing, for example, uncertainty variations with respect to the reference set), the preferred value of \(m_{W}\) for this set is determined by minimizing the \(\chi^{2}\) between the pseudo-data and the templates. The preferred value is denoted \(m_{W}^{i}\), and the corresponding bias is defined as \(\delta m_{W}^{i}=m_{W}^{i}-m_{W}^{\rm ref}\). The statistical uncertainty on the measurement is estimated from the half width of the \(\chi^{2}\) function one unit above the minimum.

The present study considers measurements of \(m_{W}\) in separate categories, corresponding to \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) events; five pseudorapidity bins, \(|\eta_{\ell}|<0.6\), \(0.6<|\eta_{\ell}|<1.2\), \(1.2<|\eta_{\ell}|<1.8\), \(1.8<|\eta_{\ell}|<2.4\), and \(2.4<|\eta_{\ell}|<4\); \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{\rm T}\) distribution fits; and two centre-of-mass energies (\(\sqrt{s}=14\) and 27 TeV). For

each category \(\alpha\) and for the PDF sets considered here, the Hessian uncertainty corresponding to a given set is estimated as

\[\delta m^{+}_{W\alpha}=\left[\sum_{i}\left(\delta m^{i}_{W\alpha}\right)^{2} \right]^{1/2}\text{ if }\delta m^{i}_{W\alpha}>0,\hskip 14.226378pt\delta m^{-}_{W \alpha}=\left[\sum_{i}\left(\delta m^{i}_{W\alpha}\right)^{2}\right]^{1/2}\text { if }\delta m^{i}_{W\alpha}<0, \tag{5}\]

where \(i\) runs over the uncertainty sets, and \(\delta m^{i}_{W\alpha}\) is calculated with respect to the reference PDF set. For CT10 and CT14, the uncertainties are divided by a factor 1.645 to match the 68% CL. Only symmetrized uncertainties, \(\delta m_{W\alpha}=(\delta m^{+}_{W\alpha}+\delta m^{-}_{W\alpha})/2\), are discussed below for simplicity. The correlation of PDF uncertainties between different measurement categories is calculated as

\[\rho_{\alpha\beta}=\frac{\sum_{i}\delta m^{i}_{W\alpha}\delta m^{i}_{W\beta}}{ \delta m_{W\alpha}\delta m_{W\beta}}. \tag{6}\]

PDF variations applied as above generate correlated variations in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{Z}\) distributions, while the latter are strongly constrained by experimental data [10, 20]. These constraints were used in the ATLAS measurement of \(m_{W}\)[21], bringing significant reduction in the PDF uncertainties. The uncertainties estimated here as thus conservative from this perspective, and partly account for uncertainties in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) distribution.

The overall measurement precision is evaluated by combining the results obtained in the different categories using the BLUE prescription [22]. Only statistical and PDF uncertainties are considered. The former are assigned assuming an integrated luminosity of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\), and normalizing the samples as summarized in Table 1. PDF uncertainties are estimated as described above.

The results of this procedure are summarized in Figures 3 and 4 and Table 2 for CT10. Figure 3 shows the PDF uncertainty correlations across the different measurement categories, for fits based on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) or \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions. Moderate or negative correlations, which will lead to reduced combined uncertainties, are observed between categories of different \(W\)-boson charges, and between central and forward pseudorapidities, at given \(\sqrt{s}\). On the other hand, PDF uncertainty correlations tend to be large and positive between \(\sqrt{s}=14\) and 27 TeV, for a given boson charge and lepton pseudorapidity range. A similar behaviour is observed for CT14 and MMHT2014.

Table 2 and Figure 4 show the expected measurement uncertainties, and their statistical and PDF components. The numbers quoted for \(0<|\eta_{\ell}|<2.4\) correspond to the combination of the four pseudorapidity bins in this range. As expected from the correlations, combining the central and forward pseudorapidity ranges brings significant reduction in the PDF uncertainties, both at 14 and 27 TeV. On the other hand, combining the 14 and 27 TeV samples mostly improves the statistical uncertainty. Statistical correlations between the fits to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) and \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions were studied and found to be small, which explains the reduction in uncertainties obtained under their combination. With 200 pb\({}^{-1}\)of data collected at each energy, a total uncertainty of about 11 MeV is obtained.

Figure 5 shows the evolution of the statistical and CT10 PDF uncertainties as a function of the size of the collected sample, for the combination of measurements at 14 TeV in all categories. The assumed integrated luminosities range from 200 pb\({}^{-1}\)to 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), approximately corresponding to one to five weeks of machine time. The statistical uncertainty decreases as expected. The statistical sensitivity of the forward categories improves with increasing luminosity, which enhances their impact in the combination with the central categories and explains the slight decrease in PDF uncertainty.

The numbers quoted for \(0<|\eta_{\ell}|<2.4\) correspond to the combination of the four pseudorapidity bins in this range.

The numbers quoted for \(0<|\eta_{\ell}|<2.4\) correspond to the combination of the four pseudorapidity bins in this range.

The numbers quoted for \(0<|\eta_{\ell}|<2.4\) correspond to the combination of the four pseudorapidity bins in this range.

Table 3 and Figure 6 compares the uncertainties obtained for different PDF sets. The CT10 and CT14 sets display similar uncertainty correlations, leading to similar improvement under combination of categories, and yielding comparable final uncertainties. The MMHT2014 uncertainties are about 30% lower. The three projected HL-LHC PDF sets give very similar uncertainties; scenario 2 is the most conservative and shown here. Compared to CT10 and CT14, a reduction in PDF uncertainty of about a factor of two is obtained in this case. Results for scenarios 1 and 3 are given in the appendix.

The LHeC projection results from a QCD fit to 1 ab\({}^{-1}\) of \(ep\) scattering pseudodata, with \(E_{e}=60\) GeV and \(E_{p}=7\) TeV. Such a sample could be collected in about five years, synchronously with the HL-LHC operation. In this configuration, the neutral- and charged-current DIS samples are sufficient to disentangle the first and second generation parton densities without ambiguity, and reduce the PDF uncertainty below 2 MeV, a factor 5-6 compared to present knowledge. Also in this case the \(m_{W}\) measurement will benefit from the large \(W\) boson samples collected at the LHC, and from the anti-correlation between central and forward categories. In this context, PDF uncertainties would still be sub-leading with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of low pile-up data.

## 4 Conclusion

Given the high \(W\) boson production cross section and the importance of an optimal reconstruction of missing transverse momentum in this channel, low-pile-up runs are an important tool for precision measurements of the \(W\) boson properties. With \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 2\), a sample of 200 pb\({}^{-1}\)can be collected in about one week, corresponding to about \(2\cdot 10^{6}\)\(W\) boson events at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, \(3\cdot 10^{6}\) events at \(\sqrt{s}=27\) TeV, and a statistical sensitivity on \(m_{W}\) below 10 MeV. If five to ten weeks can be spent collecting such data in the course of the HL- and HE-LHC, a statistical precision of about 3 MeV can be reached. Experimental systematic uncertainties are not discussed in this note, but their effect is largely of statistical nature; with adequate efforts and exploiting the full available data sample, their impact can be maintained at a level similar to the statistical uncertainty.

The numbers quoted for \(0<|\eta_{\ell}|<2.4\) correspond to the combination of the four pseudorapidity bins in this range. In each case, the first number corresponds to the sum of statistical and PDF uncertainties, and the numbers between parentheses are the statistical and PDF components, respectively.

Using current PDF sets, PDF uncertainties and their impact on the \(W\) boson transverse momentum distribution are typically 12-15 MeV when restricting to the current Inner Detector acceptance. They are reduced to about 5-8 MeV, for a range of current PDF sets, when exploiting the extended coverage allowed by the ITk. These uncertainties are further reduced to about 4 MeV when using the anticipated HL-LHC PDF set.

If the LHeC is built and runs synchronously with the HL-LHC, the combination of the large acceptance and excellent performance of the upgraded ATLAS detector and of the additional constraints on the proton structure from the theoretically clean DIS data reduces PDF uncertainties to less than 2 MeV.
