**Abstract**

This note presents the method to evaluate the resolution on the second coordinate which is needed to cope with rather large azimuthal dependence of the toroid magnetic field. The requirement proceeds from demanding that the finite knowledge of the bending power does not degrade the global momentum resolution by more than 10%. The final resolution is \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) dependent. In most of the rapidity regions, assuming only one plane of strips, the requirement for the strip width is of the order of 1 to 3 cm. In some particular critical region representing less than 10% of the fiducial acceptance, a strip width of the order of 0.5 cm is needed.

## 1 Introduction

In this note, one attempts to answer the following question :

"What is the resolution needed in the \(r\phi\) direction such that the uncertainty on the knowledge of \(\int B{\rm d}l\) (via \(\phi\)) has a negligible impact on the momentum resolution?"

As a rather arbitrary requirement, we have chosen to determine the strip width which measures the second coordinate, perpendicular to the wire measurement, such that the final momentum resolution is not degraded by more than 10% (relative change) with respect to the resolution obtained with a perfect second coordinate measurement1.

Origin of the problem

The degradation of the resolution due to the finite second coordinate resolution comes from the finite number of coils (for both barrel and end-cap). We can infer the most problematic regions by looking at Figs. 1, 2 and 3. Figure 1 shows the position of the conductors assumed for the magnetic field calculation ; Fig. 2 shows at \(z\sim 10\) meters the magnetic field lines (in a 2-D approximation). From Fig. 3 we see that the magnetic bending power (\(\sum_{i=1}^{n-1}\left|f_{i}^{i+1}\,Bdl\right|\) where the sum is performed over the different multilayer crossed by a muon track [1], see Fig. 4 for the layout) is not constant with \(\phi\), especially at some particular rapidities.

At some particular pseudorapidities and azimuth 2 there is a double deflection. Indeed, at \(\eta\sim 1.25\) and \(\phi\sim 22.5^{\circ}\) there is first a deflection due to the reverse field of the end-cap (\(z\sim 760-810\) cm), then the muon is deflected, as expected, in the barrel region (\(z\in[\sim\,850,\,1250\) cm]). In the same way at \(\eta\sim 1.65\) in the barrel coil plane, there is first the expected deflection in the end-cap (\(z\in[\sim 780,\,1200\) cm]), then a deflection due to the reverse field of the barrel coil (\(z\sim 1220-1280\) cm]).

## 3 Effect of the second coordinate resolution

### Definition of the reference

The reference resolution must be estimated without error on \(\int Bdl\) (via the precision on \(\phi\)). Thus, we have studied the variation of the momentum resolution \(\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Measurement}}}\), taken into account only the contribution from the finite chamber measurement precision, as a function of \(\sigma_{R\phi}\), the precision on the track azimuth. Figure 5 shows this resolution at \(\eta=0\) and \(p_{\perp}=30\) GeV as a function of \(\sigma_{R\phi}\). \(\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Measurement}}}\) becomes stable for \(\sigma_{R\phi}\leq 2\) mm, which means that at this level the error coming from \(\int Bdl\) is negligible. If one decreases \(\sigma_{R\phi}\) further, \(\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Measurement}}}\) keeps decreasing, because now there is a measurement of the muon momentum using the second coordinate information.

In the following we assume \(\sigma_{R\phi}^{0}=250\)\(\mu\)m for the reference measurement resolution \(\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Measurement}}}^{0}\).

Figure 6-a shows the energy loss fluctuation contribution and Fig. 6-b the measurement contribution. The total reference resolution, \(\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Tot}}}\), including energy loss fluctuation and multiple scattering, is shown on Fig. 6-c.

### Degradation of the total resolution

With a degraded second coordinate resolution \(\sigma_{R\phi}>\sigma_{R\phi}^{0}\) the momentum resolution \(\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Measurement}}}^{0}\) becomes \(\alpha\times\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Measurement}}}^{0}\) with \(\alpha>1\) (see the appendix for the numerical method used for the calculation of \(\alpha\)). Assuming three sources of error for the reconstruction of the muon momentum (measurement, multiple scattering and energy loss fluctuation in the calorimeter system), the total error is degraded in the following way :

\[\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Tot}}}\rightarrow\sqrt{\alpha\times(\sigma_{\text{ \tiny{Measurement}}}^{0})^{2}+\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Multiple Scattering}}}^{2}+\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Energy Loss}}}^{2}}\ =\ \lambda\sigma_{\text{\tiny{Tot}}}\]

where \(\lambda\) is a function of \(\eta\), \(\phi\) and \(\sigma_{R\phi}\) (through the coefficient \(\alpha\)).

### Requirement on the second coordinate resolution

In order to deal with resolutions averaged over an azimuthal domain, one defines the ratio \(A^{0}\) :

\[A^{0}=\frac{\int\limits_{\phi_{\text{Min}}}^{\phi_{\text{Max}}}\sigma_{\text{ Tot}}(\phi)\ \text{d}\phi}{\int\limits_{\phi_{\text{Min}}}^{\phi_{\text{Max}}}\text{d}\phi}\]

where :

* \(\phi_{\text{Min}}\) is the minimal azimuthal angle considered,
* \(\phi_{\text{Max}}\) is the maximal azimuthal angle considered and
* \(\sigma_{\text{Tot}}(\phi)\) is the total resolution (including multiple scattering and energy loss fluctuation contribution) at the azimuthal angle \(\phi\) assuming a perfect strip resolution \(\sigma_{R\phi}^{0}\) (see footnote #1 and Sec. 2.1).

If one choose now \(\sigma_{R\phi}>\sigma_{R\phi}^{0}\), \(A^{0}\) becomes \(A\) :

\[A=\frac{\int\limits_{\phi_{\text{Min}}}^{\phi_{\text{Max}}}\lambda\sigma_{ \text{Tot}}(\phi)\ \text{d}\phi}{\int\limits_{\phi_{\text{Min}}}^{\phi_{\text{Max}}}\text{d}\phi}\]

Finally the maximum allowed resolution for the strips, \(\sigma_{R\phi}\) (\(>\sigma_{R\phi}^{0}\)), is obtained when \(A=(1+10\%)A^{0}\).

### \(p_{\perp}\) and muon charge dependence

#### 3.4.1 \(p_{\perp}\) dependence

At high \(p_{\perp}\) (\(p_{\perp}\geq 300\) GeV) the muon trajectory is with a good approximation, a straight line. Indeed, small non-toroidal magnetic field induces very small deflection (at the assumed strip width scale). Moreover, as the resolution degrades with increasing momentum, a 10% degradation would correspond to a very poor knowledge of the bending power. Thus, at high momentum the second coordinate is not a crucial issue.

At very low transverse momentum (\(p_{\perp}\leq 20\) GeV) the deflection is very important (several centimeters), but the main contribution to the final resolution comes from the energy loss fluctuation. Therefore the precision on the second coordinate is not an issue at very low momentum.

Resolution curves with MDT chambers [1] show that \(p_{\perp}=30\) GeV seems to be closed to the optimum value to study the requirements on the second coordinate measurement. Indeed at this \(p_{\perp}\) the energy loss is no longer dominating the total resolution which is closed to its best value and the muon momentum is small enough to observe magnetic deviation with respect to a perfect toroidal system.

#### 3.4.2 Muon charge dependence

The results are symmetric for a negative muon at \((\eta,\ \phi)\) and a positive muon at \((\eta,\ 45^{\circ}-\phi)\). Therefore the study has been done for both \(\mu^{+}\) and \(\mu^{-}\) at \(\phi\in[0^{\circ},\ 22.5^{\circ}]\) and tighter requirement chosen as the resolution needed on the second coordinate.

## 4 Results

The different assumptions on chamber resolution and magnetic field are summarized in Tab. 1 (we take into account material distribution only in the calculation of \(\frac{\Delta p_{\perp}}{p_{\perp}}\)).

Assuming only one strip plane placed at the middle layer, the required strip width as a function of azimuth at given values of pseudorapidities (\(\eta=1,\ 1.25,\ 2\)) is shown on Fig. 7. In the barrel, the requirement becomes tighter when pseudorapidity increases. From this figure one notices that it could be interesting to have an effective strip width function of the azimuthal angle. This will need an optimization, especially in the transition region (\(\eta\in[1.1,\ 1.45]\)) where the strip width is quickly changing with \(\eta\) and \(\phi\).

In the transition (\(\eta\in[1.15,\ 1.4]\)) and end-cap regions (\(\eta\in[1.45,\ 2.8]\)), results are given in Tab. 2 and Tab. 3. In both cases, one _assume only one plane of strips_ at \(z=1040\) cm in the small sagitta chamber region and at \(z=1330\) cm in the end-cap region. Results are also given in terms of the angular resolution needed (in degrees).

In the end-cap coil plane we have neglected the material contribution from the cold mass of the end-cap toroid. This material would increase the multiple scattering contribution and subsequently the reference resolution \(\sigma_{\text{Tot}}\), thus, decreasing the relative importance of the second coordinate. This is the case for \(\eta\geq 1.25\) where we are a little bit pessimistic.

## 5 Conclusions

We have shown that the knowledge of the magnetic bending power leads to one of the most stringent requirement on the second coordinate resolution (requirements from alignment and trigger are less tight). Only the constraint set by the Lorentz angle correction in MDT tubes could be locally more stringent.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline item & value \\ \hline Magnetic field & 3-D \\ Multilayer resolution & 50 \(\mu\)m \\ Alignment error & 30 \(\mu\)m \\ \hline Multilayer distance & 40 cm \\ \hline Barrel & \(\eta\in[0,\ 1.05]\) \\ Small sagitta chamber & \(\eta\in[1.1,\ 1.4]\) \\ End-cap region & \(\eta\in[1.45,\ 2.8]\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}.

\end{table}
Table 1: Various hypotheses used in the simulation (see also the layout on Fig. 4).

Nevertheless, taking into account that several strip planes will be available, 3 cm strips are adequate over the most of the phase space. Only in small corners of the transition region, closed to the coils or at very high rapidities, strip widths below 1 cm are required.

Finally, it should be noticed that these studies used an old field map which does not correspond exactly to the toroid design described in the TP [2], especially at very high rapidities (new end-cap cylindrical shape). Apart from this high pseudorapidity region (\(\eta\geq 2.6\)), the results with the proper field map should not differ significantly from those presented in this note.

## Appendix A Numerical method

### Evaluation of the coefficient \(\alpha\)

We shoot one muon at a given \(p_{\perp}^{\mu}\), \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) without the multiple scattering contribution. This gives a first set of points \(r_{i}^{\phi},r\phi_{i}^{\phi}\) in the chambers hit by the muon (here we assume that the muon is seen in the end-cap chambers, so the wire measurement gives the \(r\) information[1]).

Then, we shoot a second muon at the same \(p_{\perp}^{\mu}\) and \(\eta\) but at \(\phi+\delta\phi\). By this way we obtain a second set of coordinates \(r_{i}^{\phi+\delta\phi},r\phi_{i}^{\phi+\delta\phi}\).

Table 3: Strip width and resolution needed in degrees (_assuming one plane_ at \(z=1330\) cm) in the end-cap region (\(\eta\in[1.45,\ 2.8]\)). The azimuthal regions are different with \(\eta\).

The \(r_{i}^{\phi}\) information provides the muon momentum measurement, so at first order, only this information should be used to calculate a \(\chi_{r}^{2}\) normalized to the measurement error of the chambers (see next section for a possible correction). \(\chi_{r}^{2}\) is defined by :

\[\chi_{r}^{2} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\left(r_{i}^{\phi}-r_{i}^{\phi+\delta\phi} \right)^{2}}{\sigma_{r_{i}}^{2}}\] where : * \(n\) corresponds to the number of measurements (equal to the number of multilayer), * \(r_{i}^{\phi}\) are the measured coordinates in the \(i^{\rm th}\) plane with the real azimuthal angle of the muon, * \(r_{i}^{\phi+\delta\phi}\) are the measured coordinates in the same plane for the second muon, * \(\sigma_{r_{i}}\) is the error on the measurement in the \(i^{\rm th}\) plane. By definition of the normalized \(\chi_{r}^{2}\), when \(\dot{\chi_{r}^{2}}\rightarrow\chi_{r}^{2}+(\alpha-1)\) then \(\sigma_{\rm Measurement}\rightarrow\sqrt{\alpha}\times\sigma_{\rm Measurement}\).

### Impact of the strips on the measurement (a possible correction to \(\chi_{r}^{2}\)?)

Strips are not design to measure the deflection of the muon trajectory3, but to provide an information of the position of the track along \(r\phi\) for a precise knowledge of the magnetic field (among other requirements).

Footnote 3: In general, regions where the second coordinate is important are fiducial regions where there is also a bending in the \(r\phi\) plane.

If the measurement is improve by taking into account the strip information, the degradation estimated with \(\chi_{r}^{2}\) is overestimated (the \(\chi_{r}^{2}\) estimator uses only \(r\) information).

In order to calculate correctly the strip width, a second \(\chi^{2}\), \(\chi_{r\phi}^{2}\), using the second coordinate information can be necessary :

\[\chi_{r\phi}^{2} = \sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\left(r\phi_{i}^{\phi}-r\phi_{i}^{\phi+\delta \phi}\right)^{2}}{(\sigma_{r\phi_{i}}^{\Delta})^{2}}\] where : * \(r\phi_{i}^{\phi}\) are the measured strip coordinates in the \(i^{\rm th}\) plane for the reference muon, * \(r\phi_{i}^{\phi+\delta\phi}\) are the measured strip coordinates in the \(i^{\rm th}\) plane for the second muon and * \(\sigma_{r\phi_{i}}^{\Delta}\) is the error due to the strip width \(\Delta\). \(\chi_{r\phi}^{2}>1\) means that with the help of the strips one improves the measurement with respect to the measurement obtain with only the \(r\) information. So, one can allow a larger strip width \(\Delta^{\prime}\) (\(\Delta^{\prime}\sim\Delta\times\sqrt{\chi_{r\phi}^{2}}\), where \(\Delta\) is obtain with only the \(r\) information) remaining the deterioration on the final resolution equal to 10%.

We calculate the \(\chi^{2}_{r\phi}\) as a function of \(\eta\), \(\phi\) and \(\Delta\) which is in all cases below \(1\) (we do not need to correct \(\chi^{2}_{r}\)). In conclusion, \(\chi^{2}_{r}\) is a good estimator since the second coordinate measurement is not precise enough (in the range assumed here) to improve significantly the radial measurement4.

Footnote 4: Indeed, the deflection along \(r\phi\) varies smoothly when going from \(\phi\) to \(\phi+\phi_{\rm Strip}\) where \(\oint_{\rm Strip}\) is related to the strip width \(\Delta\) by : \(\phi_{\rm Strip}=\arctan\left(\frac{\Delta}{R}\right)\) where \(R\) is the radius where the muon crosses the strip plane.
