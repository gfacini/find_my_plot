###### Abstract

The discovery potential of a Standard Model Higgs boson of 1 30 \(\div\)200 GeV produced via the vector boson fusion mechanism and decaying into W pairs is studied in this note. The \(W\)s are detected studying one leptonic and one hadronic decay.

This study was performed using ATLFAST to simulate the detector and using the PYTHIA MonteCarlo to generate both the signal and the background events. The most important background is the QCD production of \(W\)+jets which was simulated also using the VECBOS parton level MonteCarlo generator interfaced to PYTHIA for the showering and fragmentation of quarks. A signal can be observed after 3 years of data taking at low luminosity in the mass interval considered, providing a complementary evidence to that given by other channels studied for this mass range.

Introduction

The Vector Boson Fusion mechanism (VBF) to produce the Higgs boson at the LHC was already identified as the most suitable one to search for a heavy SM Higgs boson with \(M_{H}>600\) GeV ([1], [2], [3]). The favorite Higgs decay channel in this mass region is into \(W\) pairs which can be detected as a dileptonic decays or one into hadrons and the other into a lepton pair.

Recently D. Rainwater and D. Zeppenfeld [5] suggested that also in the intermediate mass range region (130 GeV \(<\)\(M_{H}\)\(<\) 200 GeV) VBF is a competitive production channel compared to the channels previously investigated such as the gluon fusion, the \(t\overline{t}H\) or the \(WH(ZH)\) associated production. The key features of the VBF mechanism are the presence of two energetic forward jets in the final state (tagging jets) and the lack of color exchange between the initial state quarks. This last fact limits the hadronic activity in the central rapidity region in contrast with most background processes where color exchange yields enhanced hadron production between the forward jets.

The Higgs decay products under investigation in ref. [5] were \(W^{+}W^{-}\) where both \(W\)'s decay leptonically or a direct decay of Higgs into \(\tau\) pairs.

In this work a study of VBF is presented studying the case with two \(W\)s in the final state with one \(W\) that decays leptonically and the other one into jet pairs. The advantages of this final state, as compared to the leptonic channel, are the larger branching fraction and the possibility to impose tighter constraints to the decay products, i.e., the invariant mass of the jet pair and the angular correlations between the charged lepton and the jets. On the other hand, studying this channel it is necessary to contrast an additional severe background source, the QCD production of \(W\)+jet events. In spite of this new background, this channel provides a significant contribution to the Higgs discovery, complementary to the full leptonic one, in the interval 130 GeV \(<\)\(M_{H}\)\(<\) 200 GeV.

## 2 Signal and Background Simulation

The ATLAS detector has been simulated using the ATLFAST package [4] with a jet clustering cone of 0.4. Jets are reconstructed within this cone using the standard ATLFAST clustering routine and, to achieve the correct energy scale calibration, a multiplicative correction factor as a function of the raw jet \(P_{T}\) has been applied, as provided in the standard ATLFAST package. This calibration factor corresponds to what will be available to ATLAS for single jet calibration with \(Z\)+jet events. The default settings of ATLFAST have been used everywhere in this note.

### Signal Generation

Samples of 100,000 events in the Higgs mass range between 130 GeV and 200 GeV have been generated using Pythia 6.1, ISUB=123 and ISUB=124 (Vector Boson Fusion). The corresponding cross section for those samples times branching ratio and corresponding integrated luminosity are shown in table 1. These leading order cross sections are in a good agreement with those from the analysis in which both \(W\)s decay leptonically rescaled by a factor 4 to account for a different branching ratio [8].

### Background Generation

A list of the most important backgrounds to this channel, together with their cross section, is given in tab. 2 as compared to the signal from a Higgs boson with \(M_{H}=160\) GeV.

Due to the large production cross section, one of the most important background is the \(t\bar{t}\) production, whose inclusive cross section is three orders of magnitude larger than that of the signal.

The \(WW\)+jets background has also been included, grouping the events as \(WW\) from EW contribution (\(WW\) bremsstrahlung in quark-(anti)quark via \(t\)-channel boson exchange) and \(WW\) from QCD contribution backgrounds (QCD radiation of jets from \(WW\) production). \(WW\)+jets QCD background has been generated using PYTHIA 6.1 ISUB=25 resulting in a cross section about 30 times greater than that of the signal. A Matrix Element generator, provided by Zeppenfeld et al., has been used to generate \(WW\)+jets EW background events and modified to allow the hadron decay of one of the two \(W\)s.

Differently to the analysis presented in [5], the QCD production of \(W\)+4 jet events as to be taken into account as another source of background to this channel. The cross section for \(W\)+4 jet events is two order of magnitude larger than that of the signal. As a first attempt, PYTHIA has been used to simulate this background. However, since PYTHIA cannot generate one \(W\) plus 4 jets as a leading order calculation, but only \(W\) plus one jet followed by showering, to cross check the PYTHIA results the VECBOS [6] parton level generator has been used. VECBOS predicts a cross section two times larger than PYTHIA.

#### 2.2.1 VECBOS Generator Implementation

VECBOS is a matrix element generator, which can generate \(W\)+\(n\) jets, with \(n\) up to four. Details about VECBOS can be found in [6].

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c} \hline Mass (GeV) & \(\sigma\cdot\)BR (pb) & Luminosity Produced (fb\({}^{-1}\)) \\ \hline
130 & 0.42 & 238 \\
140 & 0.69 & 145 \\
150 & 0.94 & 106 \\
160 & 1.23 & 80 \\
170 & 1.28 & 78 \\
180 & 1.17 & 85 \\
190 & 0.90 & 110 \\
200 & 0.78 & 128 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Value of \(\sigma\cdot\)BR and produced luminosity for the Higgs signal as a function of the Higgs mass. These values have been obtained with PYTHIA._Due to the procedure of generation, events from VECBOS have a weight \(W\), which accounts for the matrix element calculations in different regions of the phase space. In order to produce unweighted events, a standard hit-and-miss unweighting procedure was applied:

* Choose a maximum weight value (\(W_{MAX}\)), close to the real maximum weight found in the weight distribution;
* For each event compare its weight \(W\) with \(W_{MAX}\);
* If \(W<W_{MAX}\) generate a random number \(R\) between the minimum of the weight distribution and \(W_{MAX}\), and compare it with \(W\). If \(W>R\) then keep the event and redefine \(W=1\), otherwise the event is rejected;
* If \(W>W_{MAX}\) the event is kept with weight \(W/W_{MAX}\).

Using this procedure, a large number of events with weight one is obtained together with a small number of events with \(W>1\). Thus, the unweighting technique is not complete, and we still have to take care of some weighted events. It is clear from the procedure that as \(W_{MAX}\) is closer to the maximum weight of the distribution, the number of weighted events become smaller. If \(W_{MAX}\) is chosen as the maximum weight distribution the unweighting would be complete. However, in such a case a large number of events would be rejected. The choice of \(W_{MAX}\) is a trade-off between the total number of weighted events obtained and the CPU time needed to generate the sample.

Finally the Jetset MonteCarlo has been used to fragment the partons produced by VECBOS. The color fluxes were assigned in a random way, compatible with QCD rules.

### \(Ww\)+jets EW Generator Implementation

To produce the \(WW\)+jets EW background a matrix element generator provided by Zeppenfeld and his group has been used. This ME generator was written to generate \(WW\)+jets events where both \(W\) decay leptonically. We simply substituted one leptonic pair with an hadronic one (\(u\,\overline{d}\)) after the generation, but before the event is treated by Pythia for initial and final state radiation and hadronization. The color flux was defined taking into account that the hadronic pair is a color singlet. The cross section has been obtained by rescaling that of the process with a fully leptonic final state by a factor four.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c} \hline Process & \(\sigma\cdot\)BR (pb) & generator \\ \hline Signal (\(M_{H}\)=160 GeV) & 1.23 & PYTHIA \\ \(t\,\overline{t}\) & 16\(\cdot 10^{3}\) & PYTHIA \\ \(W+4jets\) & 260 & VECBOS \\ \(WW\)+jets QCD & 28 & PYTHIA \\ \(WW\)+jets EW & 0.325 & ME generator \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 3 Event Selection

### General Cuts (filter level)

A first event selection is applied to reduce the size of the ntuples used for this analysis, applying some loose cuts. The first requirement is the presence of a standard trigger signal:

\[Trig>1 \tag{1}\]

A lepton has to be present in the final state (\(P_{t}>\) 20 GeV, \(\eta<\) 2.5) while the presence of a neutrino assures a sizable amount of \(\hbox{$\,\hbox{$E$\kern-6.0pt\lower-0.43pt\hbox{/}}_{\rm T}$}\) (\(\hbox{$\,\hbox{$E$\kern-6.0pt\lower-0.43pt\hbox{/}}_{\rm T}$}>\) 20 GeV).

The presence of two forward jets, due to the VBF production mechanism, is exploited to reject the backgrounds. Different algorithms have been tried to tag these jets with the final result depending on the algorithm chosen. In this paper we will proceed in this analysis following two different choices. At first, the algorithm which has been optimized to provide the best results is discussed while in sec. 6 the results obtained with the algorithm used in the analysis where both \(W\)s decays leptonic [8] are also presented.

In the first algorithm, tagging jets are those with the largest \(P_{t}\) one in the positive and one in the negative forward (\(2<|\eta|<5\)) regions.

A search is then made for the jets produced from the \(W\) decay. These jets are expected to be central in rapidity, therefore two jets in the central(-2\(<\eta<\)2) region of the detector are required.

Figure 1: \(P_{T}\) _distribution of lepton_. _The signal is compared with WW +jets EW and \(t\overline{t}\) events._

### Cuts on Leptons

The most important backgrounds in this analysis are \(t\overline{t}\) and \(W\)+jets, due to their very large \(\sigma\cdot BR\) (compared to the signal). However, they can be strongly reduced by applying a forward jet tagging and a veto on central hadronic activity. Differently the \(WW\)+jets EW background has kinematical distributions and color structure similar to those of the signal [5], and therefore it is an important background despite the small \(\sigma\cdot BR\). As it can be seen in fig. 1 EW processes and \(t\overline{t}\) production are characterized by a large \(P_{t}\) of the decayed lepton while the signal (\(M_{H}=160\) GeV in the figure) has a lepton with a smaller \(P_{t}\). The same features apply also for \(\not\!\!{E}_{\tau}\). Therefore leptons are selected within a \(P_{t}\) window:

\[30\ {\rm GeV}<P_{ltep}<100\ {\rm GeV}\qquad 30\ {\rm GeV}<P_{miss}<100\ {\rm GeV} \tag{2}\]

As it can be seen in tab. 3 this cut is effective against \(WW\)+jets EW while it does not reject significantly the other backgrounds.

### Cuts on the Forward (tagging) Jets

The presence of two forward-emitted hard jets is the distinctive signature of VBF Higgs production. The presence of these tagging jets provides a powerful tool to reduce the backgrounds significantly as in most of the background events forward jets are not present. A first selection on forward jets has been done at filter level requiring at least one jet in the positive forward eta direction (\(\eta>2\)) and one in the negative backward eta direction (\(\eta<2\)).

The difference in rapidity between the two tagging jets is plotted in fig. 2: jets aremore separated in rapidity for the signal than for the backgrounds. Thus, a cut on \(\Delta\eta\) is applied by requiring:

\[\Delta\eta>5 \tag{3}\]

The energy of the forward jets is expected to be very large as they originate from the valence quark of the incoming protons. Looking at the \(P_{t}\) distributions (fig. 3) of the two jets, it can be noted that the signal is characterized by harder distributions. Thus a high cut on \(P_{t}\) (\(P_{t}>60\) GeV) strongly reduces the \(W\)+jets and \(WW\)+jets QCD backgrounds, but with a low efficiency (\(5-10\%\)) on the signal. A cut on the invariant mass of the two forward jets is suggested by the fact that QCD processes usually have smaller invariant masses than EW processes, as mainly small \(x\) gluons are produced in QCD interactions. To reject \(W\)+jets background as much as possible a cut at 60 GeV both for the leading and next-to-leading forward jets is imposed, as well as a cut on \(M_{jfwinv}>1200\) GeV. The final cuts on forward jets are:

\[P_{tjfw1}>60\ {\rm GeV}\qquad P_{tjfw2}>60\ {\rm GeV}\qquad M_{jfwinv}>1200\ {\rm GeV} \tag{4}\]

After these cuts are applied, the \(WW\)+jets QCD background becomes negligible if compared with the signal and it will be no longer considered. These cuts (especially that on the invariant mass) are also a powerful tool against \(t\overline{t}\). However, the cuts on the forward region are non-effective on the EW background due to its topological similarity with the Higgs signal.

The last requirement applied in the forward region is a veto against an excessive hadronic activity. In fact \(t\overline{t}\) production has an extremely rich hadronic activity while the signal is essentially an EW process. Therefore, a limit in the number of jets in the forward region is imposed (fig. 4), extending the jet veto discussed in sec. 3.5 also in the forward region.

Figure 3: \(P_{T}\) _distribution of the leading (left) and next to leading (right) forward jets. Signal is compared with \(t\overline{t}\), \(W\)+jets and WW+jets QCD backgrounds._

\[N_{jfw}<\,5 \tag{5}\]

### Cuts on the Central Jets

The \(W\) decay products are identified as the leading and next-to-leading jets in the central region. These two jets are expected to be mostly in the central region and this feature is exploited to further distinguish the signal from the backgrounds.

The \(P_{t}\) distributions for the leading and the next-to-leading jet in the central region are plotted in fig. 5 for the signal and the backgrounds. The \(P_{t}\) of jet for signal events is usually smaller than for \(W\)+jets and \(t\bar{t}\) events. This is a consequence of the fact that \(W\)s are produced almost at rest if \(M_{H}\) is about 160 GeV, so that the central jets do not have a boost effect. The cuts applied on the \(P_{t}\) of central jets are:

\[30\ {\rm GeV}<P_{tjetee1}<100\ {\rm GeV}\qquad 25\ {\rm GeV}<P_{tjetee2}<75\ {\rm GeV} \tag{6}\]

For \(M_{H}\geq 160\) GeV the dijet invariant mass peaks at about the mass of the \(W\) while the backgrounds yield a wider distribution (with the exception of \(WW\)+jets, where a \(W\to jj\) decay is present). As fig. 6 shows, the distribution for signal and \(WW\)+jets have a peak, while the distribution for \(t\bar{t}\) events is wider with a small peak coming from hadronic \(W\) decays in \(t\to Wb\) processes.

A cut on the invariant mass of the central jets (\(M_{invjee}\)) is thus applied as:

\[65\ {\rm GeV}<\,M_{invjee}<\,90\ {\rm GeV} \tag{7}\]

When \(M_{H}<160\) GeV is considered, the W bosons produced from the Higgs decay are no longer on mass-shell and a lower cut on the invariant mass of central jets would reduce the total event yield and bias the Higgs mass reconstruction. Hence this cut is released when dealing with smaller Higgs masses.

Figure 4: _Number of forward jets for signal (left) and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds. The hadronic activity is more enhanced for \(t\bar{t}\)._

The optimal strategy was to apply a slightly different set of cuts in the mass region \(M_{H}<160\) GeV by releasing the lower bound for invariant mass of central jets and tightening the cuts on the jet angular separation to keep the backgrounds under control as discussed in the following sections.

### Central Jet Veto

After the cuts on central jets are applied the most important backgrounds are \(W\)+jets and \(t\overline{t}\) production. As the hadronic activity of QCD processes (in particular \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds) is usually higher than for EW processes, a jet veto can be applied as it has been done in every analysis studying VBF signature.

The algorithm chosen is to veto any event with a third jet with \(P_{t}>20\) GeV in the central region.

\[P_{t}(3^{rd}central\ jet)<20\ {\rm GeV} \tag{8}\]

As it can be seen on table 3 this cut has a 90% efficiency on signal and on \(WW\)+jets EW while it reduces \(t\overline{t}\) by a factor of 2/3.

### Cuts on \(\Delta r_{min}\) and \(\Delta r_{max}\)

After the cuts described in the previous sections, the \(W\)+jets background is still three times larger than that of the signal, while the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(WW\)+jets EW backgrounds are almost as large as the signal. To reduce the backgrounds to a level lower than the signal, the angular correlations between the lepton and jets characterizing the Higgs events are exploited.

The Higgs boson is a spin-0 particle decaying into spin-1 \(W\) bosons. As a consequence, one jet and the charged lepton tend to be angularly very close. This fact is further

Figure 5: \(P_{t}\) _distribution of the leading and next to leading central jets. Signal is compared with \(t\overline{t}\), \(W\)+jets and \(WW\)+jets EW backgrounds._

enhanced if there is a boost effect. Moreover, the lepton-dijet system should have a small invariant mass, as a remembrance of the parent Higgs mass. As the invariant mass of three particles goes to zero if they are all close in angle, this feature is tightly correlated with the angular separation between the lepton and the dijet system.

These Higgs decay characteristics are exploited using the variables \(\Delta r_{min}\) and \(\Delta r_{max}\), defined as the minimum and the maximum of the angular distance of the charged lepton from each of the two jets.

A plot of \(\Delta r_{max}\) vs. \(\Delta r_{min}\) for the signal (different \(M_{H}\)) and various backgrounds, shows that the signal events cluster in the bottom left corner of the picture. Moreover, as the Higgs mass decreases, \(\Delta r_{max}\) becomes smaller.

Thus the following cuts for \(M_{H}\geq 160\) GeV are applied:

\[\Delta r_{min}<1\qquad\Delta r_{max}<2 \tag{9}\]

For masses \(M_{H}<160\) GeV, due to the release of the lower bound of the central jet invariant mass, a tighter cut is applied, i.e.:

\[\Delta r_{min}<0.8\qquad\Delta r_{max}<1.4 \tag{10}\]

As shown in tab. 3 (at \(M_{H}=160\) GeV) these tight cuts still have a high efficiency for the signal while they are effective to reduce backgrounds.

## 4 Results

The results of the analysis are summarized in tab. 3 for \(M_{H}=160\) GeV. The corrections due to the detector efficiency and fake veto rate [7], have been applied, but they turn

Figure 6: _Invariant mass distribution for central jets signal is compared with \(t\overline{t}\) and WW+jets EW backgrounds._

out to be negligible, due to the value of \(P_{t}\) chosen for the veto and tagging thresholds. From tab. 3 it is clear that the most important background is \(W\)+jets. Both the results obtained generating this backgrounds with PYTHIA and VECBOS are included, and the two predictions differ by a factor 4 due to the shower approach used in PYTHIA, which produces softer jets and lower jet multiplicity. \(WW\)+jets QCD background is totally negligible while \(t\overline{t}\) and \(WW\)+jets EW together amount to 30% of the signal.

Tab. 4 gives the accepted cross sections and the statistical significance for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) in the mass range 130 GeV \(<M_{H}<\) 200 GeV, compared with backgrounds. The most realistic prediction (i.e. VECBOS) for the \(W\)+jets background has been used. After three years of data-taking at low luminosity, a signal is expected to be visible at least in the \(140\mbox{GeV}<M_{H}<190\mbox{GeV}\) mass range. The Higgs discovery in a wider mass range is limited mostly by the decrease of \(H\to WW\) branching ratio at low masses and by the decrease of the cross section for VBF production at high masses. Moreover, the cut on \(\Delta r_{max}\) is less efficient on the signal as \(M_{H}\) increase.

## 5 Higgs Mass Reconstruction

To reconstruct the Higgs mass the neutrino longitudinal momentum has to be determined. To extract this information the \(W\) mass constraint has been imposed to the lepton-neutrino pair. This leads to a second order equation and therefore to two solutions for the neutrino longitudinal momentum. The lowest solution has been chosen (as suggested by the Monte Carlo) and then the invariant mass of the lepton+neutrino+central jets system can be calculated.

Fig 8 shows the sum of signal and background (full line) and background only (dotted line) for \(M_{H}=160\) GeV, for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 6 A Different Jet Tagging Algorithm

To compare these results with those obtained by other collaborators who studied other decays of the Higgs boson produced via VBF ([8],[9],[10],[11]), a common tagging jet algorithm has been also tried. In this case the tagging jets are identified as the two leading jets respectively in the positive and negative rapidity hemispheres. Moreover, jets

All numbers are expressed in fb._coming from the decay of the \(W\) have been identified as the two jets with the largest \(P_{t}\) in the \(\eta\) region between the tagging jets.Following this new algorithm, also the filtering procedure has been modified accordingly.

The remaining criteria followed were the same as discussed in the previous sections. Optimizing the cuts, the overall results are worse than those of the previous analysis (see tab. 5) as the rejection factor for the \(W\)+jets (a factor four larger than before) and for the \(t\overline{t}\) background (a factor 2 larger than before) is not big enough. The tagging jets, defined using this algorithm, can be also in the central region which is where most of the high \(P_{t}\) jets produced in association with the \(W\) are emitted by the \(W\)+jets background.

Tab. 5 shows the results obtained using the new tagging algorithm for a Higgs with \(M_{H}=160\) GeV. The selection has been made using the cuts discussed in sec. 3. Corrections for detector efficiency and fake veto rate have also been applied.

## 7 Conclusions

The Higgs detection with the ATLAS experiment using VBF \(H\to WW\to jjl\nu\) has been studied. By exploiting the distinctive features of VBF like forward jet tagging, central jet veto and angular correlations, we were able to reduce the number of background events below the number of expected signal events.

A range of Higgs mass from 130 GeV to 200 GeV was investigated, proving that a signal can be observed in the 140 GeV \(<M_{H}<\) 190 GeV mass interval after 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) with a significance as large as 5, depending on the Higgs mass. Compared to the fully leptonic channel, the search in this semileptonic decay channel requires specific algorithms for jet tagging as it is affected by an additional \(W\)+jets background. Although the results obtained are worse than those obtained for the di-lepton channel, the study of this final state is useful to cross check the discovery of the Higgs boson after three years of data taking at low luminosity.
