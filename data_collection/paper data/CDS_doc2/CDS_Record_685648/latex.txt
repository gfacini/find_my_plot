## 1 Introduction

One of the options of the ATLAS detector covering the high rapidity (\(\eta>3.0\)) region is the Combined Gas Ionization Forward Calorimeter (FC). A dedicated code within the ATLAS detector integration software package (DICE) has been written to simulate accurately this calorimeter. It provides the following opportunities:

* to study the influence of the ATLAS subsystems in the forward region on the forward calorimeter performance;
* to record the information from the forward calorimeter together with the other ATLAS calorimeters;
* to use the standard ATLAS software in order to study the combined calorimeter performance for the \(P_{t}^{miss}\) measurements.

The goals of the forward calorimetry simulation as discussed in the calorimetry panel (ref.[1]) are:

* definition of outer radius of the calorimeter;
* design optimization (pad size, etc.) to provide the required Et resolution;
* simulation of combined end-cap/forward calorimetry response,
* evaluation of the effect of interaction in Cu shield, pumps etc.

Here we present the first attempt to answer these questions using a coherent full GEANT simulation of the forward calorimeter together with a detail description of the ATLAS forward region. We also try to understand the role of the electromagnetic and hadronic sections and the cell threshold optimization.

To estimate the FC performance for different forward region configurations and for different calorimeter parameters in this study we use the \(P_{x}\) resolution for the minimumbias (M.B.) events, i.e. the RMS difference between the \(P_{x}\) generated in the following rapidity ranges

a) \(\eta=3\div 7.7\)

b) \(\eta=3\div 5\)

and measured by the calorimeter. The \(\eta=7.7\) point corresponds to the beam pipe and is important in order to understand the copper shield impact on the \(P_{x}\) resolution and the energy correlations between these two rapidity regions.

The \(P_{x}\) resolution in the M.B. events presented here provides an estimate of the missing \(P_{t}\) reconstruction accuracy in the forward region. In the future we plan to calculate the energy and \(P_{t}\)-resolution also for jets in order to study the quality of the jet tagging criteria for the heavy Higgs search (refs.[2-4]).

## 2 Forward calorimeter design

The Combined Gas Ionization Forward Calorimeter (FC), consists of two sections: electromagnetic one and hadronic one. There exist two variants of each section : either rectangular modules or hexagonal ones. The difference in calorimeter characteristics between rectangular and hexagonal variants is expected to be small. For the present study of forward calorimeter characteristics the rectangular geometry has been chosen.

The forward calorimeter design is shown in the fig.1. The following parameters has been used in the simulation:

1. General parameters of the forward calorimeter: * total length.................250 cm * outer radius.................160 cm * z-position.................1560 cm * length of copper shield..120 cm
2. Parallel plate electromagnetic section. * \(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\) gas mixture at 15 atm. * steel absorbers of 3 cm * 6 mm bigap. * em section length........12 bigaps (22 rad.len.) * module size.................40\(\times\)40 \(cm^{2}\) * module wall thickness..3 mm * tower length........6 bigaps
3. Tubes hadronic section * \(90\%Ar+10\%CF_{4}\) gas mixture at 30 atm. * modules of steel absorbers* steel rod radius.........4 mm
* tube radius............8 mm
* distance between tubes centers..1 cm.

## 3 Simulations and results

### Calibration and noise

One of the important characteristics of the FC is the level of the electronic noise (e-noise). This noise both in electromagnetic and hadronic sections, simulated according to the experimental measurements (refs.[5-7]), is shown in fig.2.

The calorimeter response has been calibrated using single \(\pi^{-}\)s and electrons. As an example fig.3 shows the FC response to 16 GeV hadrons simulated at rapidity 3.6. Fig.4 demonstrates the calorimeter response for particles produced in one minimum bias event in the rapidity range \(\eta=3\div 5\).

Fig.5 summarizes the simulated calorimeter energy resolution versus incident energies for electrons and hadrons.

### Forward region layouts

To study the effect of cryostat and copper shield on the calorimeter response we compare four different layouts:

1. Only the FC was used in the simulations. The copper shield and other elements of the forward region were switch off (FC ONLY option);
2. All forward region elements with exception of the copper shield were added to the FC. The last design of the cryostat (cylinder type, fig.6) was used (CRYO1 option);
3. Same as 2, but another cryostat design (Saclay version) was used (CRYO2 option);
4. Same as 2, but including the copper shield inside the FC (CRYO1+Cu option).

To estimate the FC performance in these layouts we compare the width of the measured \(P_{\pi}\) distribution in the forward region. For minimum bias events this generated distribution shown in fig.7 has a width of 2.5 Gev/c. We also take into account that in case of the **CRYO1** and **CRYO2** layouts a part of the leaking energy may be compensated by the signal measured in the end-cap (fig.8).

### Layouts comparison

Fig.9 shows the average energy deposited in the FC by particles as a function of rapidity. Different layouts (dashed lines) are compared to the **FC ONLY** case (solid lines). The **CRYO1** is characterized by energy losses of \(15\pm 4\%\) for particles with initial \(\eta\) below 4,while the **CRYO1+Cu** - by a higher tail for \(\eta>5\) and the **CRYO2** - by a small energy loss near \(\eta\)=3. Similar conclusions can be done from fig.10, presenting the FC measured energy versus radius. In the **CRYO1+Cu** layout about 23 GeV energy is recovered due to the copper shield. The end-cap contributes additionally 1.3 GeV energy.

It should be mentioned that due to the energy leakage in the central hole the distribution of the \(P_{t}^{diff}\), where \(P_{t}^{diff}=(P_{x}^{meas}\bigoplus P_{y}^{meas})-(P_{x}^{gen}\bigoplus P_{y} ^{gen})\) is the difference between the measured and the generated \(P_{t}\) is asymmetric (fig.11). This effect is stronger in the presence of a cryostat due to a larger fraction of energy measured near the hole.

The resulting \(P_{x}\) resolution for different layouts is shown in fig.12 for the generated \(\eta\) below 7.7 (a) and for \(\eta\) below 5 (b). The plots show the energy resolution as measured by the FC only as open circles, while closed circles give the combined end-cap plus FC resolution. It should be noticed that :

* an improvement in point 3 is due to the end-cap information. This is in agreement with a larger energy measured in the end-cap in this configuration.
* a smaller difference between points 1 and 2 for \(\eta=(3\div 7.7)\) (fig.5a) compared to \(\eta=(3\div 5)\) (fig.5b) can be explained by the correlations of the \(P_{x}\) generated within the FC aperture and in the hole.
* different layouts have been simulated using same particles, so the error on difference between the open and close circles is small compared to statistical errors which are about 5%.

An estimate of the \(P_{x}\) resolution for one bunch crossing (about 20 M.B. events at the LHC design luminosity) can be calculated from these plots by introducing a factor of \(\sqrt{20}\) and adding the contribution from the electronic noise (about 1.24 GeV/c for zero threshold). This method is not very precise because the effect of the cut on noise depends on a pileup. However our previous calculations show that with the cut on noise equal to zero the contribution of the electronic noise to the \(P_{x}\) resolution both for 1 and 20 M.B. event pileup is close enough.

### Parameters impact on the \(P_{x}\) resolution

The \(P_{x}\) resolution measured separately in the electromagnetic and hadronic sections is presented in fig.13. The following effects should be mentioned:

* an improvement of the \(P_{x}\) resolution due to the Cu shield for the hadronic section;
* negative correlations of signals in the em and hadronic sections.

Fig. 14 shows the dependence of the \(P_{x}\) resolution on the outer FC radius. For small radii the noise plays a negligible role. A bigger outer radius improves the FC resolution even in presence of a cryostat (closed circles). However this effect is degradated by electronic noise (open circles).

The contribution of the electronic noise to the \(P_{x}\) resolution can be reduced by a cut on a cell signal (fig.15). The optimal cut is sensitive to the pileup and noise level. The dependence of the \(P_{x}\) resolution for 20 M.B. events on a threshold level (measured in \(\sigma_{noise}\) ) shows that a zero cut seems to be the best solution.

Finally, the \(P_{x}\) resolution dependence on the electromagnetic section cell size is shown in fig.16. This resolution is almost insensitive to the cell size up to 30 cm. At the maximum cell size it approaches the width of the generated \(P_{x}\).

## 4 Conclusions

1. Software tools developed for the Combined Gas Forward Calorimeter gives an adequate description of this option in the framework of the full GEANT simulation of ATLAS.
2. A comparison of the different forward region layouts (two types of cryostat, copper shield) from the point of view of the \(P_{x}\)-resolution, energy disappearance and energy recovery has been performed : 1. The disappearance of energy due to the cylinder type cryostat is about 15%. 2. In this layout a 23 GeV energy is recovered due to the copper shield impact and 1.3 GeV due to the end-cap energy. 3. The difference in the \(P_{x}\) resolution between the discussed layouts seems to be small for particles generated in \(\eta=3\div 7.7\) in M.B. events.
3. Taken into account measured level of e-noise in the FC an extension of the outer calorimeter radius beyond 140 cm does not improve the calorimeter \(P_{x}\)-resolution.
4. A zero energy cut on a cell signal seems to be the \(\it{aurea}\)\(\it{mediocritas}\) for the optimal \(P_{x}\) resolution.
5. The em-section granularity below 30 cm does not improve the calorimeter \(P_{x}\)-resolution.
