###### Abstract

A study of the behaviour of very low energy muons in ATLAS TileCal has been made, with data from the stand-alone testbeam of August 2003. Transversal pion beams (\(\theta=90\,^{\circ}\)) with energies 9, 5 and 3 GeV were targeted at TileRow 2 (A-cells). The low energy muons that reached TileCal were pion decay products, both from pions that decayed before momentum selection (thus having the same energy as the pions) and from pions that decayed between momentum selection and TileCal impact (thus having energies from a continuous spectrum, ranging from 57% of the pion energy to the nominal beam energy).

The conclusions of the study are that muons can be separated from pions for these energies and that GEANT4 simulations describe data correctly.

## 1 Introduction

This note describes the main method and the results of an analysis of the behaviour of very low-energy muons in TileCal. "Very low-energy" in this context means energies between 3 and 9 GeV.

During the stand-alone testbeam, the different TileCal modules were tested separately. For the best resolution possible, this analysis contains only data from transversal (\(\theta=90\,^{\circ}\)) testbeam with impact on TileRow 2, which means that the beam goes through the smallest cells in the module, the A-cells. The data used are from the August 2003 stand-alone testbeam run, with run numbers r0360177 (9 GeV), r0360144 (5 GeV) and r0360171 (3 GeV).1

A quick calculation gives a hint on what muon range to expect:

The module is 5.64 meters long [1]. The scintillator material is polystyrene (C\({}_{6}\)H\({}_{5}\)CH = CH\({}_{2}\)), but most of the module is iron (Fe) [2]. Assuming that all of the module is iron, the mean energy loss for one muon passing the entire module should be about 7.9 GeV. We can conclude that we expect most 9 GeV muons to pass, while a muon with lower energy should stop somewhere in the module. GEANT4 simulations (see Section 4) confirm these approximations.

## 2 Muon selection

The beams analyzed contain mainly three different kinds of particles: pions, electrons and muons, where pions are the most abundant.

Since a muon with energy between 3 and 9 GeV is approximately a minimum ionizing particle (mip), it will deposit the same amount of energy per unit length in every TileCal cell it passes, until it has no energy left. A pion in this energy range does not behave like this, and the typical pion signature is a mip signal in the first few cells, followed by an energetic shower. An electron showers even earlier, and typically deposits most of its energy in the first few cells. Since the Tile Calorimeter is non-compensating, more energy will be detected from an electron than from a hadron (i.e. a pion) with the same energy.

In Figure 1 we can see histograms over the sum of the energy of the first cells, for the three different energies. The function fitted to the histograms is a sum of a Gauss-Landau convolution[3] for the muons, and two Gaussians for pions and electrons. As we can see, the fit is very good, and we can distiguish the three different kinds of particles we expected to find in the beam: muons, pions and electrons. Especially for the \(E=3\) GeV figure, it looks like there are many muons. However, there are not as many muons as the figure might suggest, since the muon peak also hides some late-shower pions. Also, the muon peak does not tell us anything about the energy of the muons it contains. Since muons of energies as large as several hundred GeV also can be considered as mips, they will lose the same amount of energy per cell as a muon of much lower energy.

The analysis should be done on low-energy muons only, so we have to cut all the other particles away. That is, electrons and pions should be removed from data, as well as the noise in data and any high-energy muons that might have slipped through the momentum selection. The

The sum is taken over the first three cells for 9 GeV data, for the first two cells for 5 GeV data and for the very first cell for 3 GeV data. Sums of two Gaussians and a Gauss-Landau convolution are fitted to the different histograms. The three different kinds of particles in the beam are clearly distinguished.

variables which we cut are

\begin{tabular}{l l} Trig == 1 & only physics events left \\ Beamextra & removes a handful high-energy muons \\ Ximp, Yimp & to get a straight beam \\ Energy scatter plot & muon selection \\ \end{tabular}

Trig is the trigger variable, to ensure that we only get interesting physics events, and no empty runs. The Beamextra variable contains data from a scintillator that should give a signal if the muon is high-energetic.2 Kimp and Yimp give the impact coordinates where the beam hits the Tile-Cal cell, and a proper choise of impact removes particles with inclined impact. The energy scatter plot cut is illustrated in Figures 2 - 4, which show the energy scatter plot for the different energies.

Footnote 2: However, this does not work perfectly, since there is some admixture of high-energy muons, especially in the \(E=3\) GeV beam.

On the \(x\)-axis we have the total energy deposited in all the A-cells for each particle. On the \(y\)-axis we have, for each event, the fractional energy in the cell with maximum energy detected. The muons, being mips, deposit about the same amount of energy in several cells and can thus be seen as a cluster near the bottom left corner of the plots.

In Figures 2 - 4 we can see that the separation between pions and muons is very good for 9 GeV. For 3 GeV the separation is not as clear, and data becomes very sensitive to the placement of the cut. But separation is still possible, as we will see.

Pion decay in the beam

As we saw in Figure 1, we have pions and electrons in the beam, beside the muons. For each energy, we have about 50 000 events and more than half of them are pions. The number of muons selected with the cuts described in Section 2 is only about 1000. Between the momentum selection and impact of the particles on TileCal module, the particles travel about 17 meters.3 Since the lifetime of a pion is \(2.6\cdot 10^{-8}\) s, a few percent of the pions decay into muons during flight, which means that we have around 1000 muons that are decay products, and therefore not of the same energy as the pions. Since the number of muons observed is about 1000, we can conclude that pion decay _is not_ negligible.

Footnote 3: See Section 6 for a more thorough discussion on pion decay and the test beam layout.

Decay muons have lower energies than the original pions. The momentum of a decay muon in the pion's center-of-mass system (CMS) is

\[p_{\mu,\,\mathrm{CMS}}\cdot c=\frac{m_{\pi}^{2}c^{4}-m_{\mu}^{2}c^{4}}{2m_{\pi} c^{2}} \tag{1}\]

We are interested in the muon energy in the laboratory system, where we make our measurements. A Lorentz transformation of the energy gives us

\[E_{\mu,\,\mathrm{lab}}=\gamma\Big{(}\sqrt{m_{\mu}^{2}\cdot c^{4}+p_{\mu,\, \mathrm{CMS}}^{2}\cdot c^{2}}+c\cdot p_{\mu,\,\mathrm{CMS}}\cdot\cos\theta \Big{)} \tag{2}\]

where the pion speed \(|\overline{v}|\) is approximated as \(c\), and we have used the scalar product relation \(\overline{v}\cdot\overline{p}_{\mu,\,\mathrm{CMS}}=v\cdot p_{\mu,\,\mathrm{ CMS}}\cdot\cos\theta\), where \(\theta\) is the CMS angle of the decay muon with respect to the beam direction.

The expressions for maximum and minimum muon energy in the laboratory frame are obtained by taking the extreme values of \(\cos\theta\) in Eq. 2, that is \(\pm 1\). The numeric results from these equations can be found in Table 1.

From the values of Table 1, it is clear that the pion decay muons have energies that vary between a value about 57% of the pion energy and all of the pion energy. The energy spectrum is flat, since muon decay recoil is equally probable in every direction in CMS, and the solid angle element \(\mathrm{d}\Omega=\sin\theta\,\mathrm{d}\theta\,\mathrm{d}\varphi\) can also be written as \(\mathrm{d}\Omega=\mathrm{d}(\cos\theta)\,\mathrm{d}\varphi\).

## 4 Comparison with simulations

In the previous section we saw that the low-energy muons in the beam are of two different kinds: Muons from pion decay and muons with nominal beam energy. In order to compare our data with simulations, we must reproduce both the nominal energy muons and the continuous energy spectrum of the decay muons.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(E_{\pi}\) (GeV) & \(E_{\mu,\,max}\) (GeV) & \(E_{\mu,\,min}\) (GeV) \\ \hline \hline
3 & 3.0 & 1.7 \\ \hline
5 & 5.0 & 2.9 \\ \hline
9 & 9.0 & 5.2 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Minimum and maximum decay muon energies, for different pion energies.

Nominal energy muons are easily reproduced, since those only require ordinary mono-energetic muon simulations. The decay muon energy spectrum is continuous, so the most correct simulation would of course be a continuous one. However, this is not as straight-forward as mono-energetic simulations. Another approach is to take apropriate amounts of mono-energetic samples of simulations with different energies in the correct range. This should not lead to any significant errors, as long as the energies of the samples chosen are sufficiently close.

As we saw in Section 3, the decay muon energy spectrum is flat. However, the energy spectrum of the decay muons that are actually observed in TileCal is not. This can be understood by thinking about what determines the energy of the decay muon. If a decay muon in the pion rest system is emitted perpendicular to the beam direction, thus getting approximately the medium energy, it also deviates more from the beam than if it is emitted straight forwards or backwards which results in maximum or minimum energy. Since the acceptance in TileCal is energy dependent, we must compensate for this when comparing data with simulations.

One way of estimating the acceptance energy dependence is to make a simple simulation, in which pions are allowed to decay during flight.

Figure 5: Energy spectra for muons accepted in TileCal, for energies 9, 5 and 3 GeV.

To simulate the beam-divergence \(x\)- and \(y\)-impacts of mother particles were taken from the pions recorded in the respective runs. We distinguish two cases: For muons from pi-decays before the the second of the two beam-chambers used to define the impact points on the calorimeter, the impact coordinates were computed using the small angle approximation by just adding the \(\Delta\)-\(x\) and \(\Delta\)-\(y\) obtained from the angle of the muon track with respect to the original pion direction. The acceptance for these muons were then obtained by applying the same impact parameter cut as used for data. There is thus no explicit requirement that the muon hits the trigger scintillator for this type of decay-muons. This is motivated by the fact that in the data sample there is a small admixture of events which, if relying on computed beam trajectory, should have missed the trigger scintillator. The presence of this type of events in data is not understood, but by applying the method above we try to include this type of events also in the acceptance correction. For muons originating from pi-decays after the second of the two beam-chambers used to define the impact points on the calorimeter, the situation is different since the impact co-ordinates will be recorded as those of the mother pion. For this class of decays we therefore cut on the impact parameter of the mother particle, and in addition we require that the decay-muon does hit the trigger scintillator.

Figure 5 shows the energy spectra for accepted decay muons from 9, 5 and 3 GeV pions. The overall acceptances are 38.0% for 9 GeV pion decay muons, 24.9% for 5 GeV and 15.8% for 3 GeV decay muons.

In order to create the simulation of the decay muons from the 9 GeV pions, we have taken a sum of simulation samples with energies 5 GeV, 5.5, 6 etc up to 9 GeV. The terms in the sum are weighted according to the top histogram in Figure 5. The 5 GeV beam decay muon simulation is a sum of samples from 3 GeV to 5 GeV with 0.5 GeV intervals. For the 3 GeV beam simulation, the sum ranges from 1.75 GeV to 3 GeV, but the intervals are 0.25 GeV. The same cuts are applied to the simulations as to data.

The results of the comparisons of data with simulations can be seen in Figures 6 - 8, which show the number of muons observed in each TileCal cell. In the figures, data are marked with stars and the mono-energetic muon simulations as well as the decay muon simulations are marked as dots above and below data. The optimal mixing of the simulated nominal energy muons and decay muons are marked with rings. Data are in good agreement with simulations, except for a small systematic effect when the muons begin to stop in the module. We see that for all three energies the data is slightly lower than the optimal simulation. Most likely this effect comes from pion contamination. Even though the cuts described in Section 2 separates the muons from the pions quite efficiently, a small amount of pions could explain why it looks like the muons stop quicker than expected.

If our cuts are efficient, all the muons we observe in TileCal are either nominal energy muons or pion decay muons.

\[N^{\mu}=N^{\mu}_{nom}+N^{\mu}_{decay} \tag{3}\]

where \(N^{\mu}\) is all of the low-energy muons observed in TileCal.

We can define a mixing parameter, \(a\), for the relative amounts of nominal energy muons and pion decay muons in TileCal.

\[N^{\mu}_{nom}=a\cdot N^{\mu} \tag{4}\]Figure 6: Muons in cells, data and GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations (MC) for nominal beam energy 9 GeV. \(\tilde{\chi}^{2}=0.43,\,18\,d.o.f.\) for the fit.

Figure 7: Muons in cells, data and GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations (MC) for nominal beam energy 5 GeV. \(\tilde{\chi}^{2}=0.31,\,18\,d.o.f.\) for the fit.

\[N_{decay}^{\mu}=(1-a)\cdot N^{\mu} \tag{5}\]

(where Eq. 5 follows from Eq. 3 and Eq. 4.)

By letting \(a\) be a free parameter of the fit, the optimal mixing between the different muon samples is obtained by minimizing the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit. The best values of \(a\) determined in this way can be found in Table 2, as well as the \(\chi^{2}\) values for these fits.

The value of \(a\) for the 3 GeV data is very sensitive to the placement of the upper cut limit in the fractional energy scatter plot (see Figure 4 in Section 2). The cut is placed in the minimum between the particle clusters, where the maximum number of muons is included while the pion contamination is low, see Figure 9.

By moving this cut within sensible limits (that is, moving it up until we have almost all the muons but many pions as well, at approximately \(\mathtt{Energy\,fraction\,in\,max}=0.33\), or moving it down until we have almost no pions but also lose some muons, at \(\mathtt{Energy\,fraction\,in\,max}=0.27\)) we can estimate the cut uncertainty. As we see in Figure 10, \(a\) varies

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Beam & Mixing & \(\tilde{\chi}^{2}\) & \(d.o.f.\) \\ energy & parameter \(a\) & & \\ \hline \hline
9 GeV & \(0.35\pm 0.05\) & 0.43 & 18 \\ \hline
5 GeV & \(0.38\pm 0.03\) & 0.31 & 18 \\ \hline
3 GeV & \(0.29\pm 0.03^{*}\) & 0.44 & 9 \\ \hline \end{tabular} \({}^{*}\) The 3 GeV \(a\) is very sensitive to the placement of the cut, which adds another error of 0.07 to the statistical one, as described below.

\end{table}

linearly with the cut placement. When the cut in Figure 4 is placed high, we include almost all muons but also many pions. \(a\) then drops, because we expect a quicker fall-off among the particles if we have pions. When the cut is placed low, we exclude most pions but also lose some muons, mainly the low-energetic ones, since those are more likely to lose all of their energy in just a few cells, thus ending up in the upper parts of the muon cluster.

The uncertainty of \(a\) due to the cut placement can be determined from Figure 10. Since the cut is varied within reasonable limits in the figure, the cut uncertainty in \(a\) is estimated as the spread in \(a\) values in Figure 10.

Figure 9: Projection on the \(y\)-axis of a strip of the scatter plot in Figure 4 (beam energy 3 GeV). The strip projected has the same width in total energy as the cut, and stretches up to \(\texttt{Energy\,fraction\,in\,max}=0.60\). The left peak contains the muons, the right peak the pions. The pions and the muons are not completely separated, but we can see that the best placement of the cut is at \(\texttt{Energy\,fraction\,in\,max}=0.30\).

The final value of the mixing parameter \(a\) for 3 GeV data is

\(a=0.29\pm 0.03(stat)\pm 0.07(cut\,uncertainty)\)

The cut dependency check also shows that for large pion contamination, data tend to lie lower than the optimal simulation when the muons begin to fall off. This observation further strengthens the hypothesis that the systematical effect observed for all the energies comes from pion contamination.

## 5 Comparison with a pure muon beam

In order to check the hypothesis of pion decay muons, we can take a look at a pure low-energy muon beam. During the test beam period of 1999, one such run was done, with 5 GeV muons. Data from that run (run number r0045360) and a comparison with 5 GeV mono-energetic simulated muons can be found in Figure 11.

The normalization of simulation to data was the free parameter of the fit in Figure 11, and the accuracy of the fit is \(\tilde{\chi}^{2}=0.81\), \(9\,d.o.f\). So the agreement is very good, and most importantly, we can clearly see that we have no pion decay muons, since those would lie lower than the mono-energetic simulation.

## 6 Cross-check of pion decay

In addition to the fit of data to simulations, there is another way to determine the expected number of decay muons. From the number of pions observed in TileCal, \(\tilde{N}^{\pi}\), it is possible to estimate the number of pions in the beam immediately after momentum selection, \(N_{0}^{\pi}\). This number can

be used to calculate the expected number of pion decays during the flight to TileCal, and thus the expected number of decay muons in the detector, \(\tilde{N}^{\mu}_{decay}\).

Immediately after momentum selection, we have pions and muons in the beam (and electrons, but we can ignore them in this case), all with the nominal beam energy. Let's denote these numbers \(N_{0}^{\pi}\) and \(N_{0}^{\mu}\). In TileCal, we observe certain numbers of pions and muons, \(\tilde{N}^{\pi}\) and \(\tilde{N}^{\mu}\). The observed muons are both nominal energy muons (the muons present after momentum selection) and decay muons from pion decays, \(\tilde{N}^{\mu}=\tilde{N}^{\mu}_{nom}+\tilde{N}^{\mu}_{decay}\). But the particles observed in TileCal are not all the particles there are, since e.g. the cuts used and inclined flight-paths reduce the number of particles actually observed. The efficiency the muon cuts, \(f^{\mu}_{cut}\), as described in Section 2 can be estimated from comparisons with simulations, and the acceptance efficiency of pions in TileCal (\(f^{\pi}_{acc}\)) can be determined by comparing the total number of events in the beams with the number of events that pass the technical cuts. Since most of the particles in the beam are pions, this ratio should be a good approximation of the pion efficiency. The acceptance efficiency of decay muons (\(f^{\mu}_{acc}\)) has been discussed in Section 4.

If \(N_{0}^{\pi}\) pions leave the momentum selection magnet, the number of pions that have not decayed after a time \(t\) is

\[N^{\pi}=e^{-t/\gamma\tau}\cdot N_{0}^{\pi} \tag{6}\]

and the number of pions that have decayed into muons is

\[N_{decay}^{\mu}=(1-e^{-t/\gamma\tau})\cdot N_{0}^{\pi} \tag{7}\]

so the total number of decay muons after a time \(t\), expressed in terms of the pions remaining, is

\[N_{decay}^{\mu}=\frac{1-e^{-t/\gamma\tau}}{e^{-t/\gamma\tau}}\cdot N^{\pi} \tag{8}\]

where \(\tau\) is the pion life-time. The time-of-flight \(t\) is determined from the distance between momentum selection and the calorimeter. This distance, between the middle of the selection magnet and the front end of TileCal in position \(\theta=90\,^{\circ}\) is 16.55 m [4].

But the observed pions and muons in TileCal are not all the particles there are, because of cut inefficiency and path deviations as discussed above. We have the relations

\[\tilde{N}^{\mu}_{decay} = f^{\mu}_{cut}\cdot f^{\mu}_{acc}\cdot N^{\mu}_{decay}\] \[\tilde{N}^{\pi} = f^{\pi}_{acc}\cdot N^{\pi} \tag{9}\]

where \(\sim\) denotes observed numbers.

The number of decay muons is related to all the muons in TileCal via Eq. 5, so we finally obtain the expression

\[\tilde{N}^{\mu}_{decay}=\left(1-a\right)\cdot\tilde{N}^{\mu}=f^{\mu}_{acc} \cdot f^{\mu}_{cut}\cdot\frac{1-e^{-t/\gamma\tau}}{e^{-t/\gamma\tau}}\cdot \frac{\tilde{N}^{\pi}}{f^{\pi}_{acc}} \tag{10}\]

from which a cross-check value of the mixing parameter \(a\) can be calculated. In Eq. 10 we assume that the amount of pions interpreted as muons (due to cut inefficiency) is negligible and that the trigger efficiency is the same for pions and muons. The \(a\) values obtained from Eq. 10, the number of muons and pions observed, and the acceptance and cut correction factors can be found in Table 3.

The \(a\) values obtained this way are about a factor two larger than the ones from the data-to-simulation fit. There are however considerable systematical errors in these calculated numbers. First of all, the distance from momentum selection to TileCal is measured from the middle of the selection magnet. In reality one can expect that the acceptance for some of the muons produced in decays between this point and the field-free region is low, which means that we underestimate \(a\) in this calculation. On the other hand: since the distance between the last and second to last dipole is considerable even a relatively small acceptance for muons from \(\pi\)-decays in this region would lead to an overestimation of \(a\). Without a detailed simulation of the beamline transfer function it is difficult to evaluate the direction and magnitude of these effects.

This cross-check is not completely independent from the data-to-simulation fit, since the muon acceptance factor was used in both calculations.

## 7 Conclusions

We have shown that it is possible to separate muons from pions in TileCal for energies as low as 3 GeV, for 90 \({}^{\circ}\)beams.

In the low-energy pion beams studied, the muons found are of two different kinds: Nominal energy muons and muons that come from pion decays. The latter particles have energies from a continuous spectrum between 57 and 100% of the beam energy.

Allowing for mixture between these two kinds of muons, the GEANT4 Monte Carlo simulations describe 9, 5 and 3 GeV data within the experimental limits of this analysis. The parameter \(a\), the ratio of nominal energy muons to all muons in TileCal, which gives the best agreement between experimental and simulated data can be compared to expectations based on the number of observed pions in TileCal. Although these values do not agree completely, they are still of the same order of magnitude. The value \(a\) estimated from pion decay may also have large systematical errors.
