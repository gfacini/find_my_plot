## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note presents a set of plots that summarize the interpretation of various searches for additional Higgs bosons beyond the Standard Model in the H5 plane benchmark of the Georgi-Machacek model. These summary plots use the full Run 2 dataset as recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider using proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV and an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 1 Summary

This note presents a set of plots that summarize the interpretation of various searches for additional Higgs bosons beyond the Standard Model in the Georgi-Machacek model [1; 2]. This interpretation uses the H5 plane benchmark that is described in detail in Ref. [3]. The excluded parameter space areas are obtained by comparing cross-section limits with theoretical predictions, taking into account the sensitivity of the experimental results on the natural width of the Higgs bosons.

## 2 Analyses Considered

Figure 1 shows the expected and observed limits at 95% confidence-level (CL) in the H5 plane benchmark of the Georgi-Machacek model for several analyses based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb\({}^{-1}\). Figures 2 and 3 show the observed-only and the expected-only limits, respectively.

In the Georgi-Machacek model, the Higgs sector contains two electroweak triplets in addition to the doublet of the Standard Model. The Higgs bosons in this model can be organized in custodial symmetry multiplets of which there are one fiveplet, one triplet and two singlets. The H5 plane refers to the Higgs bosons of the fiveplet, all of which are characterized by a single mass scale, \(m_{5}\), shown in the \(x\)-axis of the plots in Figures 1-3. The parameter \(\sin\theta_{H}\) that is shown in the \(y\)-axis of these figures is related to the vacuum expectation values of the electroweak triplets and the electroweak doublet. A more detailed description of the model and the benchmark is given in Ref. [3].

The following analyses are considered in the summary plots:

* "Search for heavy diboson resonances in semileptonic final states in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector" [4]. This is a search for a narrow-width, spin-0 radion, which is interpreted in terms of a narrow-width Higgs boson of the Georgi-Machacek model.
* "Search for heavy resonances decaying into a pair of Z bosons in the \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{\prime+}\ell^{\prime-}\) and \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) final states using 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector" [5].
* "Search for doubly and singly charged Higgs bosons decaying into vector bosons in multi-lepton final states with the ATLAS detector using proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV" [6].
* "Search for resonant \(WZ\to\ell\nu\ell^{\prime}\ell^{\prime}\) production in Run-2 of the LHC proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeVwith the ATLAS detector" [7].

The analyses in Refs. [4; 5; 7] search for the production of Higgs bosons via vector-boson fusion (VBF). The corresponding cross-sections are calculated with the VBF@NNLO code [8; 9] and the corresponding couplings in the Georgi-Machacek model are used to provide the final predictions. The branching ratios and the widths of the Higgs bosons are computed with the programme GMCALC[10]. The procedure follows the recommendations of Ref. [3].

The production of doubly-charged Higgs bosons described in Ref. [6] occurs via the Drell-Yan mechanism and does not depend on the H5 plane parameters. Moreover the doubly-charged Higgs bosons are expected to decay to same-sign \(WW\) pairs with a branching ratio of 1. The production cross-section for this process is taken from the calculation at next-to-leading order in QCD [11] that is used in Ref. [6].

The experimental upper limits provided in Refs. [4, 5] have a dependence on the assumed natural width of the Higgs bosons. In particular, the limits of Ref. [4] are valid for Higgs bosons with a natural width up to 10% with respect to the mass of the Higgs boson, whereas for the analysis in Ref. [5] the limits are valid for a width up to 0.5%. Contours corresponding to these two values of the width are also shown in Figure 1-3, and the upper limits from Refs. [4, 5] are not shown above those contours.

Figure 1: Regions of the H5 plane benchmark [3] of the Georgi-Machacek model [1, 2] excluded via direct searches for new, heavy, neutral or charged Higgs bosons. Limits are quoted at 95% CL and are indicated for the data (solid lines) and the expectation from the background model assuming only SM processes (dashed lines). The coloured areas indicate the observed excluded regions in this parameter space. The Higgs bosons that are searched for are produced via VBF for all searches shown here apart from \(pp\to H^{\pm\pm}H^{\pm\mp}\) production that proceeds via the Drell-Yan mechanism. The vector-boson fusion calculations are performed with the VBF@NNLO code [8, 9], whereas the Drell-Yan calculation follows Ref. [11]. The branching ratios and the natural widths of the Higgs bosons in the Georgi-Machacek model are calculated using GMCALC[10]. Because the heavy scalar search, \(H\to ZZ\to 4l+ll\nu\nu\), and the radion search, \(R\to VV\) (semi-leptonic), are valid only for relatively narrow Higgs bosons, dotted lines at 0.5% and 10% denote the reach of the validity of their exclusion areas, respectively. In particular, for the \(H\to ZZ\to 4l+ll\nu\nu\) search, the limit on the H5 plane is valid up to about a Higgs boson mass of 500 GeV. The red solid and dashed lines beyond this mass correspond to the observed and expected exclusion, respectively, of the cross-section limits without the width limitation.

In particular, for the \(H\to ZZ\to 4l+ll\nu\nu\) search, the limit on the H5 plane is valid up to about a Higgs boson mass of 500 GeV. The red solid line beyond this mass corresponds to the observed exclusion of the cross-section limits without the width limitation.

The red dashed line beyond this mass corresponds to the expected exclusion of the cross-section limits without the width limitation.
