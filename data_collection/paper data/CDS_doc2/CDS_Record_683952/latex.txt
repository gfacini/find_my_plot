**Abstract**

The sources of crosstalk in the LAr EM calorimeter have been studied in details. 1This note presents calculation, simulation and direct measurements on testbench and testbeam.

Introduction

Modules 00 of the barrel and endcap calorimeters with new kapton electrodes have been tested for the first time in 1998. Apart from the physics runs, extensive calibration runs have been taken during this test period. 'These runs allow, among other things, a better understanding of crosstalk in the detector and the full electronic chain.

The most critical sources of crosstalk have been identified and are presented in this note. Calculation or simulation are compared to measurements or test beam showing a correct qualitative and quantitative understanding. A few pathological case leading to large crosstalk, as for example a short-circuit on the electrode, have also been observed.

Capacitive crosstalk is treated in the section 2. Resistive crosstalk between middle and front sampling is detailed in section 3. Inductive crosstalk is presented in section 4, with an emphasis on the effects coming from the mother boards, dominant in the middle/back samplings; the mother boards test bench results and waveforms are compared with test beam data. In section 5, we briefly discuss other types of crosstalk observed. Section 6 is dedicated to general conclusions.

## 2 Capacitive crosstalk

The dominating source of crosstalk in highly segmented detectors is usually due to the coupling capacitance between cells, as sketched in Fig. 1 and calculated in Sec. 2.2 below. In ATLAS, this type of crosstalk can be found in all the samplings (front, middle, back). although it is particularly important in the fine front strips, where the capacitance to the neighbours is almost equal to the capacitance to the grounded absorber.

In first subsection, the calculation of crosstalk when fast shaping is used, is presented. The values of the crosstalk capacitance deduced from the solution of Poisson Equations are shown in second subsection. Spice simulation and testbench measurements are compared in third subsection. Finally crosstalk measured with module 0 in testbeam are presented in last subsection.

### Theoretical shapes

The traditional crosstalk through a coupling capacitor between channels can be calculated from the schematic in Figure 1. At fast shaping and with non-ideal preamplifiers the main result is that the crosstalk waveform is a slower derivative, being thus non-zero at the signal peak.

detector current \(I_{d}\) splits in the three branches : \(C_{d},R_{in}\) and \(C_{x}\). Making the approximation that \(C_{x}\) is small compared to \(C_{d}\)1 allows to calculate the current \(I_{s}\) that flows in the direct channel and \(I_{x}\) that flows in the neighbouring channel.

Footnote 1: more precisely that \(C_{x}+(C_{d}\parallel R_{e})\approx C_{x}\) which is ensured by having \(R_{in}\) small or \(C_{x}\ll C_{d}\)

\[I_{s}=\frac{I_{d}}{1+sR_{in}C_{t}}\hskip 28.452756ptI_{x}=\frac{sR_{in}C_{x}I_{d}} {(1+sR_{in}C_{t})^{2}} \tag{1}\]

in which \(R_{in}\) is the preamplifier input impedance, \(C_{x}\) the coupling capacitance, \(C_{d}\) the detector capacitance, \(C_{t}=C_{x}+C_{d}\).

The waveforms at the shaper output are obtained assuming an ideal current preamplifier with a transresistance \(R_{f}\) followed by the CR RC\({}^{2}\) shaper, whose global transfer function is given by:

\[H(s)=\frac{V_{out}(s)}{I_{in}(s)}=R_{f}\frac{\tau s}{(1+\tau s)^{3}} \tag{2}\]

in which \(\tau\) is the shaper RC internal time constant [2].

Because of the short shaping time (\(\tau\)=15 ns) the triangular detector current can be approximated by a step \(I_{d}(s)=I_{o}/s\). The signal and crosstalk at the shaper output are then given by :

\[V(s)=\frac{I_{o}}{s}\frac{1}{1+sR_{in}C_{t}}\frac{R_{f}\tau s}{(1+\tau s)^{3}} \tag{3}\]

\[X(s)=\frac{I_{o}}{s}\frac{sR_{in}C_{x}}{(1+sR_{in}C_{t})^{2}}\frac{R_{f}\tau s }{(1+\tau s)^{3}} \tag{4}\]

Figure 1: Crosstalk schematic.

Taking the inverse Laplace transform gives the signal in the time domain :

\[V(x)=R_{f}I_{o}\bigg{[}\frac{\lambda^{2}e^{-x/\lambda}}{(\lambda-1)^{3}}-\bigg{(} \frac{x^{2}}{2}+\frac{\lambda x}{\lambda-1}+\frac{\lambda^{2}}{(\lambda-1)^{2}} \bigg{)}\frac{e^{-x}}{\lambda-1}\bigg{]} \tag{5}\]

\[X(x)=-R_{f}I_{o}\frac{\lambda C_{x}}{C_{t}}\bigg{[}\bigg{(}x-\frac{\lambda^{2}+ 2\lambda}{\lambda-1}\bigg{)}\frac{e^{-x/\lambda}}{(\lambda-1)^{3}}+\bigg{(} \frac{x^{2}}{2}+\frac{\lambda+1}{\lambda-1}x+\frac{\lambda^{2}+2\lambda}{( \lambda-1)^{2}}\bigg{)}\frac{e^{-x}}{(\lambda-1)^{2}}\bigg{]} \tag{6}\]

in which \(x=t/\tau\) is the "reduced" time and \(\lambda=R_{in}C_{t}/\tau\) characterises the preamplifier rise time with respect to the shaping time.

These waveforms are drawn in Fig. 2 for \(\lambda\) small and \(\lambda=1\). It can be seen that with a fast preamplifier, the crosstalk signal is an almost perfect derivative of the direct signal with zero contribution at the signal peak, which is no longer the case with a slower preamplifier. Finally, these formulae show that the crosstalk is directly proportional to the ratio \(C_{x}/C_{t}\), as naively expected.

The crosstalk value is usually _specified_ through two quantities :

* \(X_{max}\) : maximum amplitude of the crosstalk signal normalised to the maximum amplitude of the direct signal \(V_{max}\): \(X_{max}=max(X(x)/V_{max})\).
* \(X(t_{max})\): crosstalk at the signal peak \(t_{max}\) normalised to \(V_{max}\).

Figure 2: Signal and Crosstalk theoretical waveforms from Eq. (5) and (6), with \(\tau\)=15 ns, \(C_{x}/C_{t}=1\), \(R_{in}C_{t}\)=1 ns and \(R_{in}C_{t}=15\) ns.

\(X(t_{max})\) is in principle the relevant quantity because the signal is usually sampled at its peak, but it is unfortunately very timing-sensitive and can thus vary by large factors. \(X_{max}\) is usually much more pessimistic, but gives a more precise understanding of the crosstalk.

The upper plot of Figure 3 shows \(X_{max}\) and \(X(t_{max})\) as a function of \(\lambda\). It can be noticed that there is no crosstalk for \(\lambda=0\)2 and that the ratio \(X_{max}/X(t_{max})\) is largest

Figure 3: Theoretical crosstalk amplitude from Eq. (5) and (6). Top curve : \(X_{max}\) and \(X(t_{max})\) as a function of \(\lambda\), normalised to \(C_{x}/C_{t}=1\). Bottom curves: \(X_{max}\) and X(tmax) as a function of \(C_{d}+C_{x}\) for 25 \(\Omega\) and 50 \(\Omega\) preamplifiers and \(\tau\)=15 ns, normalised to \(C_{x}\)=1. Knowing \(C_{d}+C_{x}\), the crosstalk in % is obtained by multiplying the value on the plot by \(C_{x}\). For example, in the strips \(C_{d}\)=150 pF and \(C_{x}\)=50 pF, the top curve in the middle plot gives 0.16 (%/pF) leading to \(X_{max}=0.16\times C_{x}\)=8%.

at small \(\lambda\): the crosstalk signal is a good derivative of the signal, which is the traditional case in'slow' calorimetry.

The middle and bottom plots of Figure 3 show the same results applied to the case of the strips (\(R_{e}=50\Omega\) with typical values of \(C_{d}\sim\)100-200 pF) and the middle (\(R_{e}=25\Omega\) where \(C_{d}\sim\) 500-1500 pF). The values of these capacitances are calculated and plotted in the next subsection.

### Capacitance calculations

#### 2.2.1 Front sampling (strips)

The capacitance between two adjacent cell electrodes has been simulated using 'PRIAM'[3] software to solve Poisson's equations. The signal electrode is sandwiched between the two high voltage electrodes and is narrower by 0.25mm on both sides. The capacitance between the signal and HV electrodes is almost 100 times larger than the capacitance to the absorber, so that they can be considered as perfectly coupled. In the simulation, a 1 V voltage is set on one electrode (signal and HV) and the charges induced on the absorber and neighbouring electrode are calculated, yielding the capacitances \(C_{d}\) and \(C_{x}\). The Figure 4 shows the expected electric field at \(\eta\)=0.

Figure 4: Equipotential lines in the symmetrical configuration. The HV strip width is 5 mm, the gap between HV strips is 0.5 mm and the length is 112 mm (\(\eta\)=0). The signal layer is assumed 0.25 mm narrower than the HV on both sides. The kapton thickness was taken to be 80 \(\mu\)m with \(\epsilon_{r}\) = 3.9 and the Argon gap 2.1 mm with \(\epsilon_{r}\) =1.4.

in between. The HV resistors have been removed to allow a correct measurement. The capacitance measured was \(C_{x}=2\) - 2.4 pF. For 16 electrodes this gives: \(C_{x}=16\times\langle 112\mathrm{mm}/80\mathrm{mm}\rangle\times 2=44.8\) pF to be compared to 38.3 pF for the simulation in the air.

Figure 6: Calculated crosstalk capacitances in the three longitudinal segments of the EM Barrel calorimeter.

#### 2.2.2 Middle sampling

In the middle section, the electrodes are further apart by a factor of two. According to the simulation, the coupling capacitance is reduced by a factor 1.8, leading to **0.15 pF/cm** 'one electrode, both gaps). For example, at \(\eta\) = 0, the strip electrode length is 47.6 cm and 4 electrodes are ganged in phi, leading to \(C_{x}\) = 27.8 pF.

### Spice simulations and test bench measurements

#### 2.3.1 In the strips

The effect of the crosstalk capacitance between two channels has been simulated and measured on a 50 \(\Omega\)\(\emptyset\)T preamplifier, with no cable, soldering capacitors \(C_{d}\) and \(C_{x}\) directly on the preamplifier pins. The signals were looked at the output of the medium gain of the V2bis shaper, similar to what equips the Front-end boards, used in the beam test. The waveforms are shown in Figure 8. It is clear from these plots that the crosstalk capacitance changes the peaking time and reduces the amplitude of the main signal. As

Figure 7: Calculated crosstalk capacitances in the three longitudinal segments of the EM endcap calorimeter.

it was shown in Section 2.1, the crosstalk signal is not a perfect derivative of the signal. as it is integrated on \(R_{0}C_{d}\) in which \(R_{0}\) is the cable (and preamplifier) impedance.

The Figure 9 shows the signal, crosstalk and signal+crosstalk waveforms for \(C_{d}\)=150 pF and \(C_{x}\)=100 pF. Adding signal+crosstalk allows to reproduce nicely the signal waveform with no crosstalk (within 2 per mille).

The maximum amplitude of the crosstalk pulse (\(X_{max}\)) is plotted in Figure 10 as a function of the crosstalk capacitance \(C_{x}\) for three values of capacitance to ground : \(C_{d}\)=100 pF, 150 pF and 220 pF. It can be noticed that increasing \(C_{d}\) capacitance tends to decrease the crosstalk amplitude. This can be explained by the fact that the signal is slower (see Figure 10), inducing a smaller current in the neighbouring channel, (\(i_{x}=C_{x}dV/dt\)).

Figure 8: Measured normalised signal (top) and crosstalk (bottom) waveforms for medium gain in test bench measurements with 01�50 \(\Omega\) preamplifier.

The crosstalk at the peak of the signal, \(X(t_{max})\), is the relevant value for sampling systems such as used in the readout. It is shown in Figure 11. Due to the derivative shape of the crosstalk signal, \(X(t_{max})\) is smaller than \(X_{max}\). It can be seen that the crosstalk at signal peak depends only on \(C_{x}\) and not on the capacitance to ground. This is because the ratio \(X_{max}/X(t_{max})\) decreases with \(C_{x}\) as shown in Figure 11, thus compensating the increase of \(X_{max}\) with \(C_{d}\) (see Figure 10).

From Figures 10 and 11 it can be seen that the simulation with Spice reproduces well the results obtained by testbench measurements, showing a good understanding of the capacitive crosstalk.

Figure 9: The signal waveform with (no) crosstalk is represented with dotted (full) line; the crosstalk waveform (derivative with dotted line) and signal+crosstalk (full line) are also shown. The capacitance crosstalk \(C_{x}\)=100 pF and the capacitance to ground \(C_{d}\)=150 pF. The difference between signal waveform with no crosstalk and signal+crosstalk is near the zero and shown multiply by 10.

Bottom: peak of crosstalk (left) and peaking time (right) as a function of \(C_{x}\), for various capacitance to ground. The symbols correspond to measurements and the lines to the Spice simulation, showing very good agreement.

#### 2.3.2 In the middle

A similar study was done for the middle sampling operating with a 0T 25 \(\Omega\) preamplifier. Signal and crosstalk waveforms are shown in Figure 12. The main differences with the strips are: i) a lower expected crosstalk coupling capacitance (see Section 2.2.2) and ii) a electrode cell capacitances from 5 to 10 times higher. Effects of crosstalk capacitance \(C_{x}\) on signal amplitude, peaking time, crosstalk at peak and under the signal peak are shown in Figure 13 for various capacitance to ground (\(C_{d}\)).

Figure 11: Left: variation of crosstalk at signal peak, \(X(t_{max})\), with \(C_{x}\). Right: variation of ratio of crosstalk peak, \(X_{max}\), over crosstalk at signal peak. The symbols correspond to measurements and the lines to the Spice simulation. Measurements are made for \(C_{d}\) = 150 pF (measurements with \(C_{d}\) = 100 pF, 220 pF are not explicitly shown, but coincide with \(C_{d}\) = 150 pF).

### Test beam measurements

Using the Figures 10, 11 measuring the crosstalk amplitude and peaking time of strips cells the values of C\({}_{x}\) have been measured with testbeam data thanks to the fact that one strip was 3/4 equipped (\(\phi\)=0) and the second 1/4 equipped (\(\phi\)=1) This analysis has been restricted to calibration data taken in the medium gain in order to minimise the effect of

the clock feedthrough from the calibration boards.

#### 2.4.1 Barrel FRT (Electrode A, \(0.2<\eta<0.4\))

The Figure 14 shows the qualitative comparison of the crosstalk signal from the test bench measurements, and the test beam data for strips equipped with 12 electrodes. As it can be observed, the signal shape is in good agreement for the neighbour where capacitive coupling is the dominant effect, while in the second nearest neighbour some contributions seems to add to a naive capacitive coupling.

A more quantitative approach of the crosstalk amplitude has been pursued to extract the crosstalk capacitance:

* It has been shown before that the original signal can be found back adding the crosstalk to the observed signal [3]. Assuming that the summing and mother board capacitance contribution is identical whatever \(\phi\), an average peaking time of 41.2 ns has been measured for \(\phi=0\) (38.7 ns for \(\phi=1\)) for the original signal. Using the relation between \(t_{p}\) and \(C_{t}\) shown in Fig. 15, it translates in \(C_{t}=190\) pF at \(\phi=0\) and 130 pF at \(\phi=1\). Finally, using the fact that the module 00 was only 3/4 equipped in the strips for \(\phi=0\) and 1/4 for \(\phi=1\), and solving the equation system, an equivalent detector capacitance of \(C_{d}\)=120 pF for a fully equipped strip is extracted. This is in good agreement with calculation, but the mother board+summing board (+?) capacitance extracted, C\({}_{MB}\)=100 pF, is higher than expected.

Figure 14: Capacitive crosstalk signal shape: test bench measurements (left) and test beam data (right) with signal (solid line), crosstalk in neighbour (dashed line) and in second nearest neighbour (dotted line). All crosstalk signals are magnified by a factor 10. The gray solid line is the reconstructed sum of the signal and crosstalk signals.

* Taking \(C_{d}\)=120 pF and using the amplitude of the crosstalk signal of Figure 16. 8(3.5) % in average for \(\phi=0(1)\), the crosstalk capacitance is found to be \(C_{x}=53(22)\) pF by extrapolation from Figure 13.

A good cross check consists of extracting the crosstalk at signal peak using C\({}_{x}\) and Figure 11. A value of 4-5(1.5)% while 4.4(1.2)% is measured, demonstrating again a correct quantitative agreement.

Some channels shows a larger crosstalk by almost a constant value (10 %) but the shape remains unchanged. This could be explained by a short between HV capacitance on one electrode4

Footnote 4: This procedure allows to recover a uniform peaking time (\(\sigma=0.6\) ns) for all cells whatever is the crosstalk amplitude as expected.

Figure 15: Total capacitance at the preamplifier input as a function of the measured peaking time (5-100%). The 25 \(\Omega\) preamplifiers are decently fitted by \(C_{d}(pF)=2.87t_{p}^{2}-148t_{p}+2050\) for 30 ns \(<t_{p}<\) 50 ns and the 50 \(\Omega\) preamplifiers by \(C_{d}(pF)=2.21t_{p}^{2}-163t_{p}+3113\) for 40 ns \(<t_{p}<\) 55 ns.

#### 2.4.2 Endcap FRT

Similar shapes as in the barrel were observed with the Endcap module 0 test beam data. The amplitude of the crosstalk peak is around 6%, as can be seen in Figures 17, and the crosstalk under the peak around 3%. Using method of section 2.4.1, the crosstalk capacitance, \(C_{x}\) is extracted from Figure 10. As all the strips were equipped with the same number of electrodes, \(C_{d}\) is taken from theoretical expectation. Then as in section 2.4.1, the crosstalk capacitance is deduced and found equal to 30 pF.

## 3 Resistive crosstalk on the kapton electrodes

Any resistance between channels can couple crosstalk signals, usually with the same shape than the regular signals, sometimes inverted when the resistance is in the ground return connection.

On the kapton electrodes, ink resistors (hundreds of k\(\Omega\)) connect the HV between front and middle sections. These resistors are of course very large (although not very precise), but there are many in parallel, which makes them not negligible compared to the preamplifier impedance. This will be detailed in Sec. 3

### Modelization

The high voltage to the strips is supplied from the middle section via large resistors on the kapton electrodes \(R_{M-F}\). We will now establish, by means of a crude calculation, the relation between the value of \(R_{M-F}\) and the expected crosstalk, \(X_{M-F}\), induced on each strip when a middle cell is pulsed.

Figure 16: Amplitude of crosstalk \(X_{max}\) (black circles) and \(X(t_{max})\) (open circles).

A calibration signal \(V_{cal}\) is sent into two middle cells via the injection resistor \(R^{M}_{\kappa nl}\) (\(500\Omega\) in the middle and 1 k\(\Omega\) in the back samplings). Part of this signal flows in the front cells, given by the resistive divider shown in the schematic (Figure 18):

Figure 17: Peak of crosstalk in the endcap strips when 1 out of 4 strips is pulsed; Left all the strips are shown and Right a zoom on few strips is displayed.

\[V_{M-F}=\frac{50}{R_{M-F}/N_{el}}\frac{25V_{cal}}{R_{cal}^{M}} \tag{7}\]

where \(N_{el}\) is the number of electrodes summed together in the strips (16 in the barrel and 12 in the endcap).

It should be compared to the signal obtained, \(V_{F}\), by sending \(V_{cal}\) directly in the strips via \(R_{cal}^{F}=3\) k\(\Omega\):

\[V_{F}=50\frac{V_{cal}}{R_{cal}^{F}} \tag{8}\]

Given these two expressions, one can obtained the peak-to-peak crosstalk:

\[X_{M-F}=\frac{V_{M-F}}{V_{F}}=25\frac{R_{cal}^{F}}{R_{cal}^{M}}\frac{N_{el}}{R _{M-F}} \tag{9}\]

This crosstalk has been measured during the beam test calibration runs (see section 3.2.1) and we can deduced the value of \(R_{M-F}\):

\[R_{M-F}=\frac{150N_{el}}{X_{M-F}} \tag{10}\]

### Test beam measurements

#### 3.2.1 Barrel

In order to evaluate the resistive crosstalk between front and middle section, the long distance crosstalk detailed in section 5.1 has to be subtracted. Figure 19 presents the

Figure 18: Equivalent schematic of the HV resistor on kapton electrodes.

signal in a strip corresponding to a given front calibration in presence or absence of middle cell pulsed behind. The difference of these two pulses can be attributed to the resistive coupling; this is confirmed by the fact that the shape looks like a real signal (same peaking time).

The Figure 20 shows as a function of the middle cell number and averaged over the \(N_{el}\)=8 strips behind, the amplitude of this resistive coupling, not taken into account the gain ratio between front and middle cells. The resistive crosstalk is estimated around 0.3%, which leads to a 400 k\(\Omega\) middle-front high voltage resistance, see equation (10).

Figure 19: Resistive crosstalk (solid line) resulting from the difference between the signal observed when a middle cell is pulsed behind (dashed line) or not (dotted line).

#### 3.2.2 Endcap

In the endcap electrodes, we also observed signal-like crosstalk shapes when pulsing the middle section and looking to the strips behind the pulsed middle cell. Because of a less significant long distance crosstalk (see section 5.2), we did not subtract this crosstalk contribution. The resistive crosstalk observed is shown on Figure 21 and varies from 0.8% and 2 %. The peaks (dips) corresponds to strip cells (not) in front a pulsed middle cell. The middle-front high voltage resistance is thus between 200 and 400 k\(\Omega\).

## 4 Inductive crosstalk

In this section the inductive crosstalk which mainly occurs in the middle and back samplings is detailed. Because of unexpectly high crosstalk measured during the beam test the various possible source of this crosstalk are described.

### Inductive coupling in the electrodes

1he mutual inductance between cells can induce some coupling, source of an inductive crosstalk. It has been studied in Ref. [4] for the strips and shown much smaller than the capacitive coupling - and therefore will not be mentioned in the following. In the middle section a simulation has been made using the Analog WorkBench facility. The simulated circuit is presented on Figure 22 and an inductance of 20 nH has been chosen as typical value (see the Ref.[5]). The capacitive coupling between two adjacent cells in the signal layer is also represented.

Figure 20: Amplitude of resistive crosstalk : \(\phi=1\) (solid line), \(\phi=0\) with 1 middle cell pulsed behind (dashed line) and \(\phi=0\) 2 middle cells pulsed behind (dotted line).

The Figure 23 shows a pulsed cell and the crosstalk in the nearest cell in \(\eta\). The crosstalk shape fits well to the experimental test bench data and looks like a second derivative with:

* a fast first peak. The amplitude of this inductive peak depends on the coupling coefficient. The duration of this peak, about 10 ns, is coherent with the test bench data.
* a second peak is due to the capacitive coupling. The value, 25 pF here, is adjusted to reproduce the test bench data. For the barrel, we expect typically a value of 29 pF (0.146pF/cm \(\times\) 50cm \(\times\) 4 electrodes).

### Test bench results on the mother boards

The inductive coupling can occurs on the electrodes but also in the mother boards (see more details on Figure 24). Three different paths for inductive coupling can be considered:

* the ground return:
* between calibration signal and output signals:
* between output channels, for example by the loops in regard in the low profile connectors.

Figure 21: Peak of crosstalk in the endcap strips when 1 out of 4 middle cells are pulsed; Left all the strips are shown and Right a zoom on few strips is displayed.

Figure 24: _Front face of a typical mother board (MB1 of the endcap in this case). The channels used in the following are indicated as ”Ch” for the Mil-Max part (the channel numbering for the Low Profile part can be easily deduced from the picture)._

#### 4.2.1 Inductance in the ground return

Inductance in series with the ground return shared by different electrodes leads to crosstalk. The reason is that part of the return current flows through the neighbours rather than through this inductor in the ratio of the impedances: \(sL_{1a}\) to \(R+1/sC_{d}\) (see Figure 25).

It can be easily calculated, although the expressions are too lengthy to be reproduced here. The result is a bipolar shape, with a first fast positive lobe, as can be seen in the Figure 26. When the ground return shared by \(n\) electrodes is asymmetric (only one ground on one side of the Mil-Max), as on the Endcap mother boards, the crosstalk amplitude decreases when the pulsed channel is close to the return (Ch 0-3) and increases as it gets further away. Moreover, the same type of crosstalk also appears on the back cells, which share the same ground return (Ch 32-36 when pulsing Ch 0).

Figure 25: _Equivalent schematic of the ground inductance in the mother boards._A less obvious source of inductance in the ground return is the slits, cut in the ground planes of the mother boards in order to leave the clearance around the Mil-Max connectors. The effect can be seen in the Figure 27.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \(L_{1a}\) (nH) & \(L_{1b}\) (nH) & \(L_{2}\) (nH) & largest xtalk & smallest xtalk \\ \hline
4 & 4 & 4 & 1.7\% & 0.7\% \\
4 & 4 & 0 & 0.65\% & 0.65\% \\
4 & 0 & 0 & 1.3\% & \\
4 & 0 & 4 & 2.5\% & 1.3\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 26: _Crosstalk waveforms with inductive ground return as measured on the Endcap MB tests. Dotted curve is the same channel with a surface mount capacitor soldered directly on the mother board._

#### 4.2.2 Mutual inductance coupling

Another source of inductive crosstalk can come from the mutual inductance coupling in the low profile region (between calibration and output signal, or between output signals). When one loop is circulated by a current \(i\), the facing loop develops a voltage M \(di/dt\). which produces a signal if terminated. A nice cross check of this effect is provided when testing the mother board with no capacitance soldered on it (no current can flow in the 25 \(\Omega\) resistor). As expected, no crosstalk is observed.

The mutual inductance effect is particularly important for channels located near the calibration pulse (Ch 14-15 and 30-31), as a large current varies very quickly (exponential decrease), leading to a large \(di/dt\). Ch 15 crosstalk waveform is shown in the Figure 28.

Figure 27: _Effect of apertures in the ground plane. Waveforms measured on the Endcap mother board with surface mount capacitors, far or close to the output connector._A similar effect occurs between neighbouring output channels in the low profile connector. The effect is smaller as the signals are slower, but still amounts to 0.3% in the neighbours, going down by a factor around 2 in the next neighbours. This scales with the loop area, as can be seen when 2 sockets are used, increasing the crosstalk to 0.45 %. It would thus amount to 0.15% without socket.

### Comparison of test beam and test bench data (Endcap)

There is a correct quantitative agreement between test beam and test bench crosstalk waveforms as can be seen in the Figure 30.

Figure 30: _Crosstalk in the middle sampling when pulsing the middle during the beam test in the Endcap module 0 in the Mother board MB2. Channels shown are from left to right 1, 5, 9, 13 in the upper line and 17, 21, 25, 29 in the bottom line (\(\phi\)=1). Follows the same channels but for test bench measurements._The Figure 31 summarises the peak of the crosstalk obtained by pulsing the 4 different patterns of calibration in the middle. Eight channels out of 32 are pulsed simultaneously (for example 0, 2, 9, 11, 16, 18, 25, 27 in the top plot) and the crosstalk is measured in the others, including the channels of the back section (Ch. 32-47). The numbering scheme and correspondence to eta-phi can be found on Figure 24.

Figure 31: _Crosstalk in the Endcap mother board B2. Stars : Test beam data. Open squares, data measured by replacing the electrodes by 1.5nK’ capacitors. Open circles : data with the 1.5nF capacitors soldered on the mother board. Filled circled: the same with the calibration line soldered on the mother board. Each plot corresponds to a different calibration configuration of the middle sampling._

The good agreement between the test beam (stars) and the test bench (squares) measurements can be seen again. The improvement obtained by soldering surface mount capacitors directly on the mother boards (circles) is also clearly visible, showing the dominant effect of the ground inductance between mother board and summing board.

However, even in this configuration with minimal ground return, some channels (Ch 5-9, 19-23) still suffers from high crosstalk while some did not (Ch 0-3, 12-15, 28-31) - even when being between two pulsed channels. The latter have an uninterrupted ground plane above the signal lines, while the former go through apertures in the ground plane due to the large size of the Mil-Max receptacles.

One last contribution is a mutual coupling between the connector bringing the calibration pulse and the output channels 12 to 15. In channel 15, it goes up to 4% (empty circles). Soldering the calibration line on the mother board, this coupling goes down to less than 0.2% (filled circle).

### Redesign of motherboards

The crosstalk in motherboards is dominated by the inductance in the ground connection between motherboards and summing boards, and to a similar extent, to the inductance of the ground planes on the motherboard itself, due to the apertures around the Mil-Max connectors. In order to reduce this inductance, ground pins will be added, replacing the redundant signal pin by a ground. This will at the same time remove the apertures in the ground planes.

The crosstalk in connectors is dominated by mutual inductance coupling. It is minimised by having small loop areas in connectors. In particular, in the low profiles connectors the loop area is 7.06mm*7mm with a pitch of 2.54 mm. It results in 0.4% crosstalk in the neighbours which are sometimes not neighbours in the detector. This will be reduced to 5.08*2mm by changing these connectors and removing the sockets on the mother boards. The crosstalk then goes down to 0.2%.

We can therefore expect that with modified mother boards and summing boards 5 the crosstalk can be everywhere below 0.5% in the calibration mode.

Footnote 5: One ground pin for each signal pin reduces by at least one order of magnitude the ground connection inductance and also fills the gaps of the ground apertures.

## 5 Long distance crosstalk

### Barrel

In each compartment and in absence of pulsed channel, a negative contribution can be observed and is mainly attributed to crosstalk in the feedthrough.

The Figure 32 shows the signal in the strips when the back compartment is pulsed. It can be observed that the amplitude of this crosstalk depends on the parity of the back calibration lines (For reverse parity of the back calibrations lines amplitudes will be then larger in L0 and L2). Such an effect can be attributed to the crosstalk in the feedthough already observed. The shapes are also slightly different as a function of the front calibration lines, suggesting a small contribution from the calibration pulses itself.

### Endcap

Similar conclusions can be drawn from the endcap test beam data but the long range crosstalk value is much less than in the case of the barrel (typical 0.1%) as it can be seen on Figure 33. In this case, the crosstalk contribution coming from the feedthrough is strongly reduced (only on flange).

## 6 Conclusions

The calibration test beam data from barrel and endcap modules 00 has been used to extract the values of the crosstalk amplitude in front, middle and back sampling. Several conclusions can be drawn from this analysis:

* The crosstalk in the strips is dominated by capacitive coupling between two adjacent electrodes.
* In the barrel, the coupling capacitance is around \(C_{x}=50\) pF on each side for a capacitance to ground (absorber) \(C_{d}=150\) pF. This results in a peak crosstalk of \(\sim\) 10%, with a first derivative shape giving \(\sim\) 5% at the signal peak.
* In the endcap, the extracted coupling capacitance is around 30 pF and the resulting peak crosstalk around 6%.
* The resistive crosstalk between middle and strip section can be explained by the presence of HV resistor ink between these two samplings. The resistance value has been evaluated to few hundred of k\(\Omega\).
* The crosstalk in the middle is dominated by inductive effects, mostly located on the mother boards. The capacitive coupling (\(C_{x}=30\) pF) is expected to contribute around 1% but very poorly differentiated due to the large capacitance to ground.

Figure 33: _Crosstalk observed in the strips (from strip number 80, top left, to strip number 88, bottom right) when back is pulsed as a function on the front calibration line. Medium gain was chosen and the crosstalk correspond to \(\sim\) 0.1% of the pulsed channel._In the Endcap, the crosstalk in the middle and back is dominated by the inductance in the ground return on mother boards and summing boards. It is due to an insufficient number of ground pins between these two boards and to the apertures opened in the ground layers. This will be cured by having one ground pin for every signal pin on the mother boards.
