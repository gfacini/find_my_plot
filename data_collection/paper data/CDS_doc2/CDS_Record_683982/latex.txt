###### Abstract

In this note we derive a general formula for the first Townsend coefficient \(\alpha\) for uniform and non-uniform electric fields over a wide range of gas densities \(N\). In particular, it is shown that the formulae existing in the literature fail for non-uniform electric fields because of the misinterpretation of the gas data obtained in uniform electric. Furthermore, the optimization of the gas gain has been realised, including the space charge effect, streamer and Geiger discharge.

Introduction

In the design and use of the proportional counters it is obviously important to have some theoretical general formulae relating the gas gain to the counter geometry, the voltage and gas pressure. Any theory of ionization in an electric field attempts to derive a relation between the first Townsend coefficient \(\alpha\), (i.e the numbers of the ions pairs produced when an electron has moved one unit length in the direction of the field), and the pressure, temperature, nature and state of the gas and the field strength. If \(n(x)\) is the number of the electrons at a given position \(x\), after a path \(dx\) in the field direction the increase in the number will be

\[dn(x)=n(x)\alpha(x)dx \tag{1}\]

and, by integration between two positions \(x_{2}\) and \(x_{1}\) results to

\[lnM=\int_{x_{1}}^{x_{2}}\alpha(x)dx. \tag{2}\]

It is assumed that the electrons, which regarded as the dominant producer of the ionizations, have collided with the gas molecules at times well before an analysis of their average ionizing power is made. This means that any disturbances caused by electrodes and the wall are excluded. Also only those gases are considered here which do not attach electrons.

## 2 First Townsend coefficient formula

The first Townsend coefficient can be defined as the mean number of collisions for an electron per unit length in the direction of the electric field \(A_{e}\) multiplied the ionization propability \(P(\epsilon_{x}>\epsilon_{s})\), i.e the chance of the energy \(\epsilon_{x}\) gained by an electron from the electric field - in the direction of the field - between two collisions to be higher than the ionization energy \(\epsilon_{s}\)

\[\alpha=A_{e}P(\epsilon_{x}>\epsilon_{s}). \tag{3}\]

The mean number of collisions for an electron per unit length in the direction of the electric field can now be written :

\[A_{e}=(\frac{dn}{dx})=(\frac{dn}{dt})(\frac{dt}{dx})=(\frac{v_{m}}{\lambda})( \frac{1}{v_{d}})=\frac{\omega}{\lambda}=\frac{1}{\lambda_{x}} \tag{4}\]

where \(\lambda_{x}\) is the mean free path for electrons in the direction of the electric field, \(\lambda\) is the mean free path for electrons, \(v_{m}\) is the mean velocity, \(v_{d}\) is the drift velocity and \(\omega=\frac{v_{m}}{v_{d}}\) is a constant [1]. The mean free path is

\[\lambda=\frac{1}{N\sigma} \tag{5}\]where \(\sigma\) is the total scattering cross section. If we define \(s(\varepsilon)\) to be the effective cross section at the electron energy \(\varepsilon\) and \(f(\varepsilon)\) the distribution, we can express \(\sigma\) in the form

\[\sigma=\int s(\varepsilon)f(\varepsilon)d\varepsilon. \tag{6}\]

The ionization probability can be approximated as:

\[P(\varepsilon_{x}>\varepsilon_{\imath})=\exp{(\frac{-\varepsilon_{\imath}}{ \varepsilon_{x}})} \tag{7}\]

where \(\varepsilon_{\imath}\) is the first ionization energy of the gas mixture and \(\varepsilon_{x}\) is the energy that obtained an electron from the field, travelling over a distance \(\lambda_{x}\).

_The mean energy is proportional to the energy \(\Delta\varepsilon\) obtained by an electron from the field, travelling over a distance \(\lambda\) in the direction of the field [1]. Thus we have:_

\[\varepsilon_{m}=\psi\Delta\varepsilon=\psi\int_{r}^{r+\lambda}eE\lambda dr= \psi\omega\varepsilon_{x} \tag{8}\]

Substitution of the equations (4) until (8) to (3) we obtain

\[(\frac{\alpha(x)}{N})=\omega\sigma exp(-\frac{\omega\varepsilon_{\imath}}{ \Delta\varepsilon}) \tag{9}\]

_This is a general formula of the first Townsend coefficient for application in a wide range of gas-mixtures and for all electric fields (uniform and non-uniform). It is obvious that the first Townsend coefficient for non-uniform fields is a function of \(x\) since \(\Delta\varepsilon\) and \(\sigma\) are functions of the \(x\)._

In many gases like argon, methane,ethane and isobutane, \(s(\varepsilon)\) is expressed approximately as:

\[s(\varepsilon)=\gamma\varepsilon\hskip 72.27pt1<\varepsilon<10\hskip 72.27pteV \tag{10}\]

and

\[s(\varepsilon)=\delta\sigma_{\diamond}\hskip 72.27pt0.2<\varepsilon<0.8 \hskip 72.27pteV \tag{11}\]

where \(\gamma\), \(\sigma_{\diamond}\) - the Ramsauer coefficient and the Ramsauer effective cross section respectively - and \(\delta\) are constants for a given gas mixture. Figures (1) and (2) show the collision cross sections for different gases [2][3].

Equation (6) for \(1\) eV \(<\varepsilon<10\) eV becomes

\[\sigma=\gamma\varepsilon_{m} \tag{12}\]

and for \(0.2\) eV \(<\varepsilon<0.8\) eV

\[\sigma=\delta\sigma_{\diamond} \tag{13}\]

## 3 Application of the first Townsend coefficient

### Parallel plate counters

In homogeneous fields - i.e constant electric fields - the calculation of \(\Delta\epsilon\) results to

\[\Delta\varepsilon=\int_{x}^{x+\lambda}eEdx=eE\lambda=\frac{eE}{N\sigma}. \tag{14}\]

If the cross section is constant, that implies that the mean energy of the electrons are locate in the region between 0.2 and 0.8 eV. Insertion of (13) to (14) gives

\[\Delta\varepsilon=\frac{eE}{N\delta\sigma_{o}}=(\frac{e}{\delta\sigma_{o}})S \tag{15}\]

where \(S=\frac{E}{N}\) is the reduced electric field.

The equation (9) becomes

\[\frac{\alpha}{N}=C_{0}e^{-\frac{\epsilon_{o}C_{0}}{S}} \tag{16}\]

where

\[C_{0}=\omega\delta\sigma_{o} \tag{17}\]

The eq. (2) for the gas gain in plate detectors with gap width \(G\) results to

\[\ln M=C_{0}NGe^{-\frac{\epsilon_{o}C_{0}}{S}} \tag{18}\]

The fit results of the parameter \(C_{0}\) using the formula (18) from the data by Sauli [4] are shown in table 1. If we make the assumption that \(\omega\) is close to unity, then the fit values of the \(C_{0}\) accord with experimental values of the Ramsauer cross section \(\sigma_{o}\) - see figures (1) and (2).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Mixture & \(C_{0}\) & \(\varepsilon_{i}\) \\  & \((\frac{cm^{2}}{melecula})\) & (eV) \\ \hline \hline \(Ar-CH_{4}\) (98.4-1.6) & 1.28 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-16}\) & 15.7 \\ Methane \(CH_{4}\) & 6.15 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-16}\) & 12.6 \\ Ethane \(C_{2}H_{6}\) & 6.35 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-16}\) & 11.5 \\ Isobutane \(C_{3}H_{8}\) & 7.83 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-16}\) & 13.77 \\ \hline \end{tabular}.

### Cylindrical counters at low pressure or thin anode wire

At low pressures or thin wires the field nonhomogeneity cannot be neglected and near to the anode wire the \(r\) is comparable to \(\lambda(r)\). Then \(\Delta\varepsilon\) becomes

\[\Delta\epsilon(r)=\int_{r}^{r+\lambda(r)}eE(r)dr=\frac{eV}{\ln(\frac{b}{a})}\ln [1+\frac{1}{\gamma Nr\Delta\varepsilon(r)}] \tag{26}\]

This is a transcedental equation and the calculation of the first Townsend coefficient and gas gain are realised with numerical methods. Figures (5) and (6) show the results of the model for \(P_{10}\) and isobutane respectively [5].

_From this we can conclude that the electrons mean energy \(\varepsilon_{m}\) in radial fields depends on two scaling factors_

\[D_{1}=(\frac{V}{\ln\frac{b}{a}}) \tag{27}\]

and

\[D_{2}=Nr. \tag{28}\]

_Therefore the first Townsend coefficient and the gas gain contains both scaling factors in an independent way. Only in the case of high gas density and large anode wire diameter does the formula depend on the ratio of these factors, \(D_{1}/D_{2}\), which is equal to the reduced electric field \(S(r)\)._

In many publications by various authors semi-empirical first Townsend coefficient formulae for the cylindrical proportional counters are presented. All these formulae were collected in a general model that was created by Aoyama [2]. The dominant characteristic of this model is that it approximated the average energy of the electrons for radial electric fields as a function of the reduced electric field S(r). This approximation is only valid for high pressure cylindrical counters with thick anode wires because, in those cases, the gradient of the field strength can be neglected. _Neglecting the field inhomogeneity is the main reason why the dependency of the gas density in the cylindrical detectors is badly described by gas gain formulae._ Beingesser et al. [6] introduced in their empirical formula a 'non-Townsend'term

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Mixture & \(C_{1}\) & \(C_{2}\) & \(\varepsilon_{*}\) \\ \hline \hline \(Ar-CO_{2}-CH_{4}-N_{2}\) (90-5-3-2) & \(9.80745\times 10^{-8}\) & \(0.12870\) & \(15.54\) \\ \(Ar-CO_{2}-CH_{4}-N_{2}\) (88-5-3-4) & \(10.453585\times 10^{-8}\) & \(0.12895\) & \(15.51\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

to correct for the effect of this field inhomogeneity. Nevertheless, authors attribute the deviations of the gas gain from their formulae to the space charge effect.

### Multi-Wire Proportional Counters (MWPC)

A MWPC consists of a set of the anode wires, all at the same potential and each wire acting as an independent counter. Therefore the MWPC operates as a set of independent counters. A typical cell structure of the MWPC is sketched in figure (7) It is obvious that the equipotential lines of the field near the anode are similar to the cylindrical symmetry. For the testing of the first Townsend coefficient and the gas gain in cell structures we can be use the following trick: We locate the region that the field satifies the cylindrical symmetry and we define as \(R\) the radius of the radial region - see figure (7) - and \(V_{R}\) the potential at a distance \(R\) from the anode wire. The rectangular cell is reduced for the multiplication process to a cylindrical cell with \(a\) and \(R\) the anode and cathode radius, respectively and \(V_{f}=V_{a}-V_{R}\) the effective voltage. This assumption is valid because the avalanche starts near the anode wire.

## 4 Secondary processes

### Space charge effect

The amount of the space charge in cylindrical counters can be found by solving the Poisson equation

\[\nabla^{2}\Phi=\frac{\rho e}{\epsilon_{o}} \tag{29}\]

where \(\rho\) the space charge density.

Using the boundary conditions \(\Phi(a)=V\) and \(\Phi(b)=0\) and if the gas gain is sufficiently high we may assume that all of the positive ions are created near the anode wire. In this region, the electric field is:

\[E(r)=[\frac{V}{\ln(\frac{b}{a})}-\frac{\rho eb^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{o}\ln(\frac{ b}{a})}]\frac{1}{r} \tag{30}\]

Equation (30) shows that the effect of the space charge is to reduce the electric field near the anode due to the applied potential by an amount:

\[\delta V=\frac{\rho eb^{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{o}}. \tag{31}\]

The electric field around an avalanche due to effect of the space charges is demonstrated schematic in figure (8). The calculation of the charge density can be deduced if we approximate the charge lies nearly a sphere of radius \(R_{s}\).

\[\rho=\frac{Q}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_{\ast}^{3}}=\frac{M}{\frac{4}{3}\pi R_{\ast}^{3}} \tag{32}\]

The effects leading to the spatial spread of the avalanche charge are:

* diffusion of the electrons
* the restoring force perpendicular to the direction of electrons cloud motion caused by the heating of the electons.

The spatial spread is given:

\[\sigma=2R_{\ast}=\sqrt{2\int_{a}^{b}\frac{\epsilon_{k}}{E(r)}dr}. \tag{33}\]

The characteristic energy \(\epsilon_{k}\) - which is defined \(\frac{2}{3}\epsilon_{m}\) - is proportional to the mean energy and furthermore proportional of \(\sqrt{S(r)}\) - see equation (21).

Figure (11) shows the plot of characteristic energy \(\epsilon_{k}\) for five pure gases against E [3]. Then equation (33) results to

\[R_{\ast}=\sqrt{\frac{2}{9}[\frac{e}{\gamma}\ln(\frac{b}{a})(\frac{1}{VN})]^{ \frac{1}{2}}(b^{\frac{1}{2}}-a^{\frac{1}{2}})}. \tag{34}\]

From this equation we can conclude that the spatial spread of the electrons - consequently the spatial size of the avalanche also - is decreased for counters with high pressures, thick anode wire, small tube diameter and large Ramsauer coefficient \(\gamma\). As we can see in figure (2) the polyatomic hydrocarbon quenchers have large \(\gamma\). _Since the collection time of the total charge depends on spatial size of the avalanche, that is one reason why we observe short collection time at high pressures and large percentage of polyatomic hydrocarbon quencher. It is not correct that many authors developed the space charge by the assumption that the avalanche is distributed uniformly around the wire._

Substitution of (32),(34) to (31) gives:

\[\delta V=(\frac{0.2164}{\epsilon_{o}})(\gamma)^{\frac{3}{4}}M\frac{(VN)^{ \frac{3}{4}}}{(\ln^{\frac{3}{4}}(\frac{b}{a})}\frac{b^{2}}{(b^{\frac{3}{2}}-a ^{\frac{1}{2}})^{\frac{3}{2}}} \tag{35}\]

Substituting the effective voltage \(V_{eff}=V-\delta V\) into equation (23) we found the gas gain in the presence of the space charge effect. Figure (20) shows the gas gain \(M\) as a function of the applied voltage \(V\) affected by space charge.

### Self-quenching streamer discharge

The streamer effect occurs as follows: if the charge density increases high enough, the space charge potential \(\delta V\) partially cancel the external potential \(V\). As a result the electrons are cooled and radiative recombination [7] may occur.

\[\lambda^{+}+e^{-}\longrightarrow.4+h\nu. \tag{36}\]

Therefore some energetic photons may be produced which travel outside the space charge cloud and produce electrons. A few of these electrons can then drift back and multiply at the top of the positive ion cloud - see figure (9) [7] - where the field is highest. Multiplication should not occur at the sides of the cloud due to the low field. The complete transfer to the streamer mode occurs when \(\delta V\approx V\).

_Finally, we conclude that the main reason for the streamer effect is the high charge density. The secondary avalanches produced only by photons originated with the radiative recombinations of positive ions and electrons._

### Geiger discharge

In many cases, although the density charge of the primitive avalanche is very low, (thus the probability of the radiative recombinations is zero) secondary avalanches occur in the radial direction. The explanation is as fellow: the electrons of the primary avalanche drift towards the anode in the presence of the electric field. Near the anode wire electrons may get an energy much greater then the ionization energy of the neutral molecule and it possible to create an additional electron-excited ion pair in the collision.

In a time that is usually no more than a few nanoseconds,these excited ions return to their ground state through the emission of the photons whose energy may exceed the ionization energy of the molecules.

\[A+e^{-}\longrightarrow A^{+*}+2e^{-}\longrightarrow A^{+}+2e^{-}+h\nu. \tag{37}\]

These photons are the key element in the propagation of the chain reaction that makes up the Geiger discharge in high pressure counters. If one of these photons interacts by the photoelectric absorption in some other regions of the gas, a new electron is liberated which can subsequently migrate toward to the anode and will trigger another avalanche - see figure (10) [8]. Figure (20) shows the gas gain \(M\) as a function of the applied voltage \(V\) affected by secondary electrons. Although there are also photons whose energy may not exceed the ionization energy, their contribution in the creation of extra electrons is impossible at high gas densities (very small probability of photons to reach the cathode tube) since organic molecules have many rotational.vibrational and disassociatedal modes.

Optimization of the proportional region in cylindrical counters

### Conditions for the proportionality of the gas gain

The optimization of the amplification proportional region can be achieved if we optimize the detector parameters to keep the probability of the reactions (36) and (37) sufficient low. The reaction (36) implies that the \(\delta V\) potential of the space charge must be lower than the detector potential V and the reaction (37) implies that the mean energy of electrons is lower than the ionization energy near the anode wire. Thus for the proportionality of the gas gain to apply:

\[V>\delta V \tag{38}\]

and

\[\epsilon_{i}>\epsilon_{m}.. \tag{39}\]

Insertion of (35) to (38) gives:

\[V>L_{0}\gamma^{3}M^{4}N^{3}\frac{b^{8}}{\ln^{3}(\frac{b}{a})(b^{\frac{3}{2}}-a ^{\frac{3}{2}})^{6}}=V_{ST} \tag{40}\]

where

\[L_{0}=(\frac{0.2164}{\epsilon_{o}})^{4}. \tag{41}\]

Combining equations (8), (21) and (39) gives

\[V<\gamma\psi\epsilon_{i}^{2}\ln(\frac{b}{a})Na=V_{GM}. \tag{42}\]

### Transition from propoportional to Geiger region

The transition occurs when \(V=V_{GM}\), therefore the highest proportional gas gain - combining equations(42) and (23) - is

\[M_{GM}=e^{0.231\epsilon_{i}^{2}\psi\gamma Na} \tag{43}\]

From eq. (43) we conclude that the highest proportional gas gain in connection to the Geiger mode is

1. proportional to the detector paramerers \(a\) and \(N\) and
2. proportional to the Ramsauer coefficient \(\gamma\) - the quantity of the quencher.

Figures (12) and (13) show the plots of the highest proportional gas gain as a function of the pressure for various anode diameters and mixtures respectively.

In addition, that is the physical reason why the geiger discharges appear in low gas gains only at low densities, in counters with thin anode wires and low quantities of quencher.

### Transition from propopportional to Streamer region

We define the "streamer tendency coefficient" \(d_{st}\) as

\[d_{st}=L_{0}\gamma^{3}N^{3}\frac{b^{8}}{\ln^{3}(\frac{b}{a})(b^{\frac{8}{2}}-a^{ \frac{8}{2}})^{6}} \tag{44}\]

which depends on:

1. the detector parameters \(a\),\(b\) and \(N\) and
2. the gas parameter \(\gamma\).

Relation (40) becomes

\[V>d_{st}M^{4}=V_{ST} \tag{45}\]

The transition from proportional to streamer mode occurs when \(V=V_{ST}\). The highest proportional gas gain is

\[M_{ST}=(\frac{V}{d_{st}})^{\frac{1}{4}} \tag{46}\]

The calculation of equation (46) is performed with a numerical method since the gas gain \(M\) is a function of voltage \(V\) also.

Figure (14),(15) and (16) show the plots of the highest proportional gas gain in connection to the streamer mode as a function of the pressure for various anode diameters, tubes and mixtures respectively. _We can conclude that streamer signals in low gas gains are produced:_

1. _at high densities,large anode wires and small tubes and_
2. _for high Ramsauer coefficient_ \(\gamma\)_, (therefore for high quantities of quencher)._

### Maximization of the proportional gas gain

The maximum proportional gas gain can be achieved if

\[M_{max}=M_{ST}=M_{GM}. \tag{47}\]

The condition (47) implies:

_we must compensate the detector parameters - \(N,a,b\) - with the gas parameters - \(\epsilon_{*},\gamma\) - to pick up the maximum proportional gas gain._

Figure (17) shows the interconnection between the proportional, geiger, streamer and discharge region for \(Ar-CO_{2}-CH_{4}-N_{2}\) (90-5-3-2).

### Predictions of the model in Muon Drift Tubes

Since the operating pressure of the MDT's is much higher than 1 bar (\(\geq 3bar\)) the proportional mode is attacked only with the streamer mode - see figure (17). The maximization of the proportional gas gain can be achieved, if

1. **we decrease the amount of quencher** (see fig. 16),
2. **we decrease the diameter of the anode wires** (see fig. 14),
3. **we increase the diameter of the tubes** (see fig. 15),
4. **we decrease as far as possible the pressure** (see fig. 14,15,16).

Operating conditions 1 and 4 increases the Lorentz angle - see figures (18a) and (18b)-, moreover condition 1 decreases also the drift velocity - see figure (19).

Condition 2 does not effect the drift velocity and the Lorentz angle (probably it creates additional problems in the X-ray Tomography project).

Condition 3 probably creates additional manufacture difficulties.
