The production of large samples of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs at the LHC allows exploration of the detailed properties of these heavy quarks. The study of top-antitop spin correlations could be used to probe for possible new interactions in the strong production vertex, for example involving supersymmetric particles or extended Higgs sectors. Results are presented of the ATLAS sensitivity to the predicted spin correlations, measured using only lepton observables.

Introduction

Large statistics production of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs at the LHC will allow detailed studies of the properties of the top quark. Due to the large mass of the top quark, some of its properties differ significantly from those of the lighter quarks. In particular, the width of the top quark, governed by its weak decay, is given by

\[\Gamma\,\left(\,t\to b\,W^{+}\,\right)=\frac{G_{F}\,m_{t}^{3}}{8\pi\sqrt{2}}\, \mid V_{tb}\mid^{2}\left(1-\frac{M_{W}^{2}}{m_{t}^{2}}\right)^{2}\,\left(1+ \frac{2M_{W}^{2}}{m_{t}^{2}}\right) \tag{1}\]

For m\({}_{t}\) = 174 GeV, \(\Gamma\,(\,\)t \(\rightarrow\)b W\({}^{+}\,)\(\,\)\(\simeq\) 1.5 GeV, corresponding to a very short lifetime of \(\tau_{t}\)\(\simeq\) 0.5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-24}\) s.

In contrast, the time scale for hadronization, the inverse of the hadronization rate \(\Gamma_{had}\), is given by \(\Gamma_{had}\) = v\({}_{r}\,\Lambda\), where v\({}_{r}\) is the relative velocity of the t-quark and its partner at the other end of the string. The separation distance characteristic of the string breaking is estimated to be about 1 fm, which corresponds to \(\Lambda\simeq\) 200 MeV. Hence, the hadronization time may be estimated as \(\tau_{had}\)\(\simeq\) 5 \(\times\) 10\({}^{-24}\) s. The timescale for confinement, which corresponds to 1/\(\Lambda_{QCD}\), is also of the same order as the hadronization scale.

The top quark lifetime is, therefore, small compared to the confinement and hadronization time scale [1]. As a consequence, top quarks decay, to good approximation, as free quarks before hadronizing, and well before the strong interaction has time to depolarise their spin. Therefore, the spin alignment of the top and antitop quarks in the production vertex could be studied via analysis of their decay products.

According to the Standard Model (SM), more than 99 % of top quarks decay via \(t\to Wb\), in which a longitudinally or transversely polarised W boson is produced in conjunction with a left-handed b-quark. The production of W bosons with helicity \(\,{\rm h}^{W}=+\) 1 is forbidden by angular momentum conservation. W boson production with helicity \(\,{\rm h}^{W}=-\)1 occurs with relative weight = 1, while longitudinally polarised W boson production with helicity \(\,{\rm h}^{W}=\) 0 occurs with relative weight \(f=m_{t}^{2}/2m_{W}^{2}\)[2]. The SM therefore predicts that about 70% of top decays will produce a longitudinally polarised W boson.

In the case of leptonic W boson decays, the SM predicts that the helicity angle \(\theta^{+}\) of the charged lepton, as measured in the W rest frame, will follow the distribution

\[\frac{1}{N_{tot}}\frac{{\rm d}N}{{\rm d}\,\cos\theta^{+}}=\frac{3}{8}\,\frac{ 1}{1+f}\,(1-\cos\theta^{+})^{2}+\frac{3}{4}\,\frac{f}{1+f}\sin^{2}\theta^{+} \tag{2}\]

The production of \(t\bar{t}\) pairs at the LHC is dominated by gluon-gluon (\(gg\)) fusion. The spin polarization of the top transverse to the plane of the hard process \(gg\to t\overline{t}\) in the center-of-mass system is very small, since it results only from higher order corrections to the simple QCD tree diagrams. The polarisation is proportional to \(m_{t}\), and is a function of the production angle and of the top quark energy in the \(t\bar{t}\) rest frame. The predicted tranverse polarisation, however, is below 1.3 %, as shown in Fig. 1, which reproduces the calculation of reference [4]. Therefore, it will be difficult to detect the polarisation in a direct way, even with the large \(t\bar{t}\) production rate at the LHC, while will yield more than 800 million pairs integrated over the complete machine run.

To observe the polarization of top and antitop separately, however, would give opportunity to test P,C and CP violation or conservation in the strong vertex. Such violation could arise due to new mechanisms in the g-\(t\)-\(\overline{t}\) vertex [5],[6],[7],[8],[9].

## 2 Spin Correlations in \(t\overline{t}\) events

Another approach to study the dynamics of the strong vertex in \(t\overline{t}\) production is to look for spin-spin correlations of the \(t\) and \(\overline{t}\) quarks in the \(t\overline{t}\) system. When summed over all events, the predicted correlation is small and does not exceed a few percent [10].

However, there is an asymmetry in the rate for production of "like-spin"

Figure 1: The transversal polarisation of the t-quark as function of the energy \(E_{t}\) in the center of mass of the \(t\overline{t}\) system in GeV and the cosine of the production angle \(\theta_{t}^{*}\).

(LL,RR) versus "unlike-spin" (LR,RL) orientation of \(t\), \(\overline{t}\) quarks if the appropriate spin axes are chosen [3]. The corresponding cross sections for both spin orientations have been calculated. In the case of \(q\overline{q}\) annihilation:

\[\frac{\mbox{d}^{2}\,\hat{\sigma}_{LL,RR}}{\mbox{d}\beta\,\mbox{d} \cos\theta^{*}} \sim (\,1\,-\,\beta^{2}\,)\,\sin^{2}\theta^{*} \tag{3}\] \[\frac{\mbox{d}^{2}\,\hat{\sigma}_{LR,RL}}{d\beta\,\mbox{d}\cos \theta^{*}} \sim (\,1\,+\,\cos^{2}\theta^{*}\,) \tag{4}\]

while for gluon-gluon fusion:

\[\frac{\mbox{d}^{2}\,\hat{\sigma}_{LL,RR}}{\mbox{d}\beta\,\mbox{d} \cos\theta^{*}} \sim {\cal Y}(\beta,\cos\theta^{*})\,(\,1\,-\,\beta^{2}\,)\,(\,1\,+\, \beta^{2}\,+\,\beta^{2}\sin^{4}\theta^{*}\,) \tag{5}\] \[\frac{\mbox{d}^{2}\,\hat{\sigma}_{LR,RL}}{\mbox{d}\beta\,\mbox{d} \cos\theta^{*}} \sim {\cal Y}(\beta,\cos\theta^{*})\,\beta^{2}\,\sin^{2}\theta^{*}\,( \,1\,+\,\cos^{2}\theta^{*}\,) \tag{6}\]

where

\[{\cal Y}(\beta,\cos\theta^{*})\,\equiv\,\frac{7\,+\,9\beta^{2}\cos^{2}\theta^{*}}{ \left(\,1\,-\,\beta^{2}\cos^{2}\theta^{*}\,\right)^{2}} \tag{7}\]

and \(\beta\) and \(\theta^{*}\) are the velocity and helicity angles of \(t\) in the \(t\overline{t}\) rest frame. The indexes L,R refer to the spin orientation left-handed, right-handed of \(t,\overline{t}\) in the helicity system. These relations allow one to calculate, for example, a spin asymmetry given by

\[{\cal A}=\frac{N_{LL,RR}\,-\,N_{LR,RL}}{N_{LL,RR}\,+\,N_{LR,RL}} \tag{8}\]

Figure 2 shows the asymmetry predicted for LHC energies, plotted as a function of \(E_{t}=m_{t}/(1-\beta^{2})^{1/2}\) and \(cos\theta_{t}^{*}\). The asymmetry as shown has been derived using the parton-level relations given above, and a version of Pythia modified as described below to correctly take into account the spin correlations.

From figure 2, one sees a clear enhancement of like-spin helicities in the region of low energies for the \(gg\) subprocess, while for \(q\overline{q}\) annihilation there is an enhancement of unlike-spin helicities. At the LHC, however, \(t\bar{t}\) production is dominated by \(gg\) fusion, which contributes 90% of the total cross-section. Therefore, as shown in figure 2c, \(t\bar{t}\) production at the LHC should demonstrate an excess of like-spin helicities for low energies. This is in contrast with Tevatron \(t\overline{t}\) production where 80% of the heavy quark pairs should have unlike-spin orientation in the beam line system [3].

One can probe the \(t\) and \(\bar{t}\) spin orientations by studying their decay products. In the \(t\) rest frame, the angular distribution of final product \(i\) with respect to the top spin vector will in general follow the simple relation

\[\frac{1}{N_{tot}}\frac{{\rm d}N}{{\rm d}\,\cos\Theta_{i}}=\frac{1}{2}\,\left( \,1\,+\,\alpha_{i}\,\cos\Theta_{i}\,\right) \tag{9}\]

where the coefficients \(\alpha_{i}\) depend on which particle is considered (\(\,\alpha=1\) for leptons, \(\overline{d}\) and \(\overline{s}\) quarks; \(\alpha\) = - 0.31 for neutrino, u and c-quarks; \(\alpha\) = - 0.40 for b-quark ) [3]. From these coefficients, it is evident that, in addition to being experimentally simplest to measure, charged leptons are a good probe of the top spin orientation.

To investigate possible \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlations, one can measure the differential angular distribution for daugther \(i\) from \(t\) decay and daughter \(j\) from \(\bar{t}\) decay, which can be written as

\[\frac{1}{N_{tot}}\,\,\frac{{\rm d}^{2}N}{{\rm d}\cos\Theta_{i}\,{\rm d}\,\cos \overline{\Theta}_{j}} = \frac{1}{4}\left(\,1\,-\,\kappa\,\cos\,\Theta_{i}\,\cos \overline{\Theta}_{j}\,\right) \tag{10}\]

where the coefficient

\[\kappa = {\cal A}\,\alpha_{i}\,\overline{\alpha}_{j} \tag{11}\]

is a measure of the relative spin orientations of \(\,t\) and \(\,\overline{t}\) in the helicity frame, and could provide a test of the SM predictions.

The coefficient \(\kappa\) is bounded between -1.0 and 1.0, and the pure like-spin orientation corresponds to \(\kappa\)\(=-1.\) In the case that both \(t\) and \(\overline{t}\) decayed spherically in their rest frames (uncorrelated spins), one would expect \(\kappa\)\(=\) 0.

In this analysis, we will investigate further only the angular distributions from the two charged leptons arising in events in which both W's decay leptonically. In this case \(\alpha_{i}=\)\(\overline{\alpha}_{j}=1,\) and therefore \(\kappa=\mathcal{A}.\)

The value of \(\mathcal{A}\) computed for 1 million events generated according to SM expectations with PYTHIA is

\[\mathcal{A}_{SM}\,=\,0.33\,\pm\,0.01\,(stat) \tag{12}\]

which is in good agreement with the results of reference [13].

Also the fractional difference between the SM distribution and that measured with (b) standard PYTHIA, (c) the CP28 model, and (d) the CP96 model. In each plot the solid line shows the distribution for all events, and the dashed (dotted) line shows the results for events with \(m_{ll}<M_{Z}\) (\(m_{ll}>M_{Z}\)).

## 3 Generation and reconstruction of dilepton events

For the analysis, Monte Carlo events have been generated with the default version of PYTHIA and also with a modified version, where the top-antitop spin correlation information is provided according to equations (3) through (7) and the matrix element for top decay takes into account the top polarisation:

\[\mid\,{\cal M}\,\mid^{2}\,\,\,\sim\,\,\,\frac{m_{t}^{2}\,E_{l}\,(m_{t}\,-\,2E_{ l})}{(\,q^{2}\,-\,M_{W}^{2}\,)^{2}\,+\,\Gamma_{W}^{2}\,M_{W}^{2}}\,\,(\,1\,-\,h\, \cos\Theta_{l}\,) \tag{13}\]

Here, \(E_{l}\) and \(\theta_{l}\) are the energy and the angle of the lepton with respect to the top spin direction, as measured in the top rest frame, \(q\) is the lepton+neutrino 4-momentum and \(h_{SM}=\alpha_{l}=1\). Predictions from the standard PYTHIA matrix elements would correspond in this approach to the choice \((h,\bar{h})=(0,0)\). The SM prediction corresponds to \((h,\bar{h})=(+1,-1)\).

Also the fractional difference between the SM distribution and that measured with (b) standard PYTHIA, (c) the CP28 model, and (d) the CP96 model. In each plot the solid line shows the distribution for all events, and the dashed (dotted) line shows the results for events with \(m_{ll}<M_{Z}\) (\(m_{ll}>M_{Z}\)).

CP-violation in top production and decay would affect the \(t\) and \(\bar{t}\) spin-polarisation and spin correlation properties, and could give rise to different values for \((h,\bar{h})\). As representative examples of two models incorporating CP violation we consider \((h,\bar{h})=(0.2,-0.8)\) (referred to hereafter as "CP28") and \((h,\bar{h})=(0.9,-0.6)\) (dubbed "CP96").

Physical observable, such as the polar angle \((\cos\theta_{ll})\) and azimuthal angle \((\phi_{ll})\), angles between the two isolated leptons, are sensitive to changes in \(h\)'s. Given their experimental cleanliness, they has been investigated as potential probes of the \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlations.

As mentioned previously, the predicted spin correlations are a function of \(m_{t\bar{t}}\). This quantity cannot be directly measured for dilepton events, due to the missing neutrinos. However, a variety of possible kinematic variables, such as

Also the fractional difference between the SM distribution and that measured with (b) standard PYTHIA, (c) the CP28 model, and (d) the CP96 model.

the dilepton invariant mass, are loosely correlated with \(m_{tt}\) and could be used in the investigation of spin correlations.

For each model about \(10^{6}\)\(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{l}\nu\bar{b}l\bar{\nu}\) events were generated for each different pair of light charged leptons (\(ee,e\mu,\mu e,\mu\mu\)). Each sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of about 100 \(\mbox{fb}^{-1}\), as expected to be collected during the first 3 years of LHC operation. The ATLFAST 2.0 package [11] has been used to simulate the response of the ATLAS detector.

Dilepton events were selected with the criteria described in reference [12], in order to reduce the background from \(DY+jets\),\(Z\to\tau\tau+jets\),\(WW+jets\) and \(b\bar{b}\) production. Smaller background sources, like \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\) production, were also taken into account. For the sake of completeness, it should be noticed that the \(gg\to WW\) contribution was taken into account through a parametrisation

given by theoretical calculation, and is on this basis not expected to contribute significantly to the final sample of selected events. The current knowledge of the cross-section for \(b\overline{b}\) production still allows for a large uncertainty, up to a factor of about 3. However, as will be seen, the selection cuts reduce the background to a small level.

Two sets of cuts were investigated. For SET1 (SET2), two high \(p_{T}\) isolated, opposite-sign leptons were required to have \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}>35\), 25 GeV (35, 30 GeV). For the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) cases, an additional requirement was imposed on the dilepton invariant mass, \(|m_{ll}-m_{Z}|>10\) GeV. Selected events were required to satisfy \(p_{T}^{miss}>40\) GeV. Also, the presence of two jets with \(p_{T}>15GeV\) was required.

These selection criteria resulted in a signal-to-background ratio of S/B=7.8, with a selection efficiency of about 31.5%. Requiring at least one of the jets be tagged as a b-jet improved S/B to 50, and reduced the efficiency to about 23%.

## 4 Results

The selection cuts were applied to the data samples described previously. After cuts, angular distributions for the different MC data samples were normalised to the number of selected events in the SM sample. The results, as described in more detail below, are shown in figures 3 through 8. In all figures, the errors bars shown represent the statistical errors only.

As discussed previously, the correlations due to spin orientations would depend on the center-of-mass energy of the quarks. We have not fully reconstructed events. However, we have investigated using the dilepton mass as an estimator of \(m_{tt}\) for this purpose. (While \(m_{jjll}\), the invariant mass of the system jet-jet-lepton-lepton, or \(m_{jjllptmiss}\), might be expected to be a better estimator of \(m_{tt}\), these would require study of possible systematics due to the jet energy scale, and so have not yet been studied.) In each figure, the solid line shows the case where all events are considered, while the dashed (dotted) lines shows the result for those events with \(m_{ll}<m_{Z}\) (\(m_{ll}>m_{Z}\)).

Fig. 3(a) shows the measured \(\cos\theta_{ll}\) distribution for the case of the SM prediction. The corresponding distribution for the surviving background is shown as the shaded histogram in Fig. 3(a). The fractional differences between the measured distributions for the SM and those for the other models considered are shown in Fig. 3(b) for standard PYTHIA, in Fig. 3 (c) for CP28, and in Fig. 3 (d) for CP96. The same distributions for the azimuthal angle difference \(\phi_{ll}\) are shown in Fig. 4 (a,b,c,d). The azimuthal angles are much less affected by the boost of \(t\overline{t}\) rest system and therefore might give more reliable information.

The same distributions for b-tagged events are displayed in Fig. 5 and Fig. 6 for cuts SET1, and in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 for cuts SET2.

For both polar and azimuthal angles, differences at the level of a few percent are observed between the distributions measured for the different models. The differences from the Standard Model for the CP96 model are somewhat less pronounced than for CP28, as expected due to the smaller deviation of the spin parameters from the SM values.

The differences between the SM distributions and those from the other models seem to indicate stronger deviations for smaller vales of \(m_{ll}\). This dependence is as expected due to the predicted correlation with \(m_{t\bar{t}}\).

In the two leptons channels of \(t\bar{t}\) production the systematics errors were studied in connection with top mass evaluations[12][14]. Similarly, for the angular lepton correlations, used in our case for the observation of spin-correlations, the two sources of systematics errors could be considered: the background effects and errors in the momenta reconstruction of leptons. As seen in Fig.3. and Fig.4. the background contribution depends on cuts on lepton momenta and b-tagged events efficiency. The angular distribution due to background would be changed only slightly, however, the contribution to the systematic error of coefficient \({\cal A}_{\cal SM}\), eq. (12), could reach \(\pm 0.03\). The leptons momenta reconstruction

Also the fractional difference between the SM distribution and that measured with (b) standard PYTHIA, (c) the CP28 model, and (d) the CP96 model. In each plot the solid line shows the distribution for all events, and the dashed (dotted) line shows the results for events with \(m_{ll}<M_{Z}\) (\(m_{ll}>M_{Z}\)).

will also contribute to the error, but for momenta cuts used in selection criteria (SET1, SET1) the error of \({\cal A}_{\cal S\cal M}\) will be bellow \(\pm 0.015\). Therefore, the systematic errors on asymmetry coefficient \({\cal A}_{\cal S\cal M}\), which measures possible signal of spin effects, would be about \(\pm 0.03\). The further study of systematic errors in connection with the ratios of parallel and anti-parallel top spin orientation is necessary.

## 5 Discussion

The comparisons shown in figures 3 through 8 of the angular distributions measured for the SM prediction and the other models demonstrate differences at the several per cent level. These differences are statistically significant, as can

be seen from the relative sizes of the statistical error bars shown on the figures. In addition, the surviving background, which has different angular distributions than the signal, can be seen to have been reduced to a small level.

Given the small size of the deviations, further study of possible systematic errors is needed before a quantitative statement can be made about the observability of the effects. In addition, the studies performed here of the "toy models" should be repeated with more theoretically motivated models incorporating CP-violation in the top sector.

Many suggestions of possible CP-violation mechanisms in the production vertex of \(t\bar{t}\) have been recently published, and variables which could be used to search for such deviations from the SM have been suggested [5]. As an example, we have studied the variable suggested by reference [9], \(cos(\theta_{+})+cos(\theta_{-})\) where \(\theta_{+}\) (\(\theta_{-}\)) is the angle in the laboratory system between the \(z\) axis (direction of one of the primary protons) and the positive (negative) charged lepton.

In Fig. 9 we plot the difference of the distributions of this variable for the SM prediction compared to the toy CP-violating models. Only small differences are observed, again demonstrating the difficulty in observing these effects, despite the large statistical sample of events available at the LHC. As expected, the difference is most visible for model CP28.

Further study is required to quantify the significance of such effects, and to search for methods to enhance their observability.
