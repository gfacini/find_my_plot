**Abstract**

This note presents an extension of a previous study [1] on the expected performance of \(b\)-jet tagging in ATLAS experiment using low \(p_{T}\) electrons from semileptonic \(b\)-quark decays. Inner Detector and the EM Calorimeter information is used. The performance is evaluated in terms of the expected hadron rejection versus the electron identification efficiency and the expected suppression of background events versus the acceptance of signal events. The samples of Higgs decays \(H\to b\bar{b}\) ( \(H\to gg,u\bar{u},c\bar{c}\)) with \(m_{H}=100~{}GeV\) and \(m_{H}=400~{}GeV\) are used as signal (background) events, in full rapidity coverage (\(\mid\eta\mid<2.5\)) and for low luminosity operation. For an algorithm efficiency of 50%, rejections of 470 against \(u\)-jets for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV (resp. 55 for \(m_{H}=400\) GeV), 209 (resp. 43) against gluon jets and of 44 (resp. 22) against \(c\)-jets can be achieved.

Introduction

The identification of low \(p_{T}\) electrons with the ATLAS detector will be important in many areas of physics studies [2, 3]:

* triggers for B-physics channels,
* CP violation studies,
* calibration of the EM calorimeter with \({\rm J}/\psi\to ee\) decays,
* \(b\)-tagging using electrons from semileptonic decays of \(b\)-quarks.

Here we concentrate only on their application for \(b\)-tagging, _i.e._ the selection of jets originating from \(b\)-quark decays. Many interesting physics channels, expected to be observed with the ATLAS detector, will have \(b\)-quarks in the final state. \(b\)-jet tagging will be crucial for SM and MSSM Higgs searches [4, 5], study of the SUSY particles [6, 7] and top-quark decays [8].

The most powerful method of \(b\)-tagging is the vertex method, based on the relatively long lifetime of \(b\)-hadrons [9]. The second method is tagging by low-\(p_{T}\) leptons originating from semileptonic decays of \(b\)-quarks. The lepton tags are efficient only for a few percent of \(b\)-jets, because the branching ratio is low for such decays (about 17% per lepton family), but this method can be combined with the vertex algorithm and provide a complement to the overall \(b\)-tagging performance. In this paper the second method, using soft electrons, is considered. Similar studies on tagging \(b\)-jets with soft muons are presented in [2].

Previous studies [1] were based on the identification of soft electrons for jets of moderate transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{j}\), \(<p_{T}^{j}>\approx 50\) GeV, and over a small central rapidity range \(|\eta|<0.3\). \(H\to b\bar{b}\), \(m_{H}=100\) GeV events were used as the signal sample. To enrich the population of electrons, only selected events with \(b\to e\) decays were fully simulated. In the previous studies, the jets were simulated and reconstructed with the fast simulation. As in the present analysis, the xConver [10] algorithm was applied for \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays and the ATLAS detector was simulated with the DICE 96_9 package. Neither electronic noise nor pile-up effects were included in the reconstruction of the EM Calorimeter information. For a nominal efficiency of the algorithm of 50%, rejections were achieved of \(\sim 200\) against gluon jets, \(\sim 45\) against \(c\)-jets and \(\sim 600\) against \(u\)-jets.

In the present note the previous analysis has been completed and extended by:

* evaluating the electron identification and \(b\)-tagging performance in the full rapidity range of the Inner Detector (\(|\eta|<2.5\));
* using two \(H\to b\bar{b}\) samples, with \(m_{H}=100\) GeV and 400 GeV, which probe different, wider ranges of jet transverse momenta;
* reconstructing jets in the combined electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters;
* estimating the branching ratio BR(\(b\to e\)) by the fraction of reconstructed \(b\)-jets containing electron tracks (involving electrons from \(\gamma\) conversions);
* taking into account the effect of the spiraling of low-\(p_{T}\) electrons in the magnetic field;
* using a more advanced method of electron identification in the EM Calorimeter 2; Footnote 2: Many thanks to Michal Seman for his help and his reconstruction code.
* including the electronic noise in the EM Calorimeter signals.

The overall performance in the full rapidity range is expected to degrade, with respect to that achievable for low \(|\eta|<0.3\)[1], as particles at larger \(|\eta|\) are crossing more material (higher fraction of electrons from conversions, worse electron/pion separation). Also for jets with higher transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{j}\) (\(m_{H}=400\) GeV samples), the \(b\)-tagging performance of this algorithm is expected to be worse in comparison to lower \(p_{T}^{j}\) jets (\(m_{H}=100\) GeV samples), due to the higher density of particles in high \(p_{T}^{j}\) jets.

## 2 Samples

### Generated samples

The samples used for this analysis (the same as in [2]) contain events from Higgs boson associated production \(WH\) (\(W\rightarrow\mu\nu\)). Two Higgs masses \(m_{H}=100\) GeV and \(m_{H}=400\) GeV are used. The signal sample consists of \(H\to b\bar{b}\) events while background samples contain \(H\to c\bar{c},u\bar{u},gg\) events. All samples are generated using the PYTHIA 5.7 Monte Carlo generator.

About 20 000 events with \(m_{H}\) = 100 GeV were fully simulated for each of the signal and background channels. A dedicated subsample of \(H\to b\bar{b}\), about 4000 events, filtered for electrons at the event-generation level 3 is also used in the analysis. For \(m_{H}\) = 400 GeV about 10 000 events were generated for each of the channels \(H\to b\bar{b},c\bar{c},u\bar{u},gg\). The package DICE 98_2[11] was used to simulate the ATLAS detector performance.

Footnote 3: At least one electron with \(p_{T}^{e}>\) 1 GeV and \(|\eta_{e}|~{}<~{}2.5\) is required to be found in a cone \(\Delta R~{}<~{}0.4\) around each \(b\)-quark axis (before FSR). This sample is used only for the optimisation of the variables used for electron identification (see section 3).

The following preselection was applied on the generated events: the events were required to have hard partons (before Final State Radiation) from the Higgs decay with transverse momentum \(p_{T}>\) 15 \(GeV\) and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\).

### Event reconstruction

Jets are identified as clusters in the combined EM and hadronic calorimeters. A noise threshold, set at 2\(\sigma\) of the electronic noise distribution of each cell, and a total \(p_{T}\) threshold of 10 GeV for the reconstructed jets are used. The ID pattern recognition program xKalman [12] is used with the reconstructed jet directions as seeds and a road half-width of 0.5. The \(p_{T}\) threshold for reconstructed tracks is set to 0.7 GeV [2].

The xConver package [10] is used to reject electrons coming from converted photons and from Dalitz decays. The reconstruction of the fully simulated events is performed using the ATRECON package and the Combined Ntuples (CBNT) containing information from all ATLAS subdetectors (tracks, electromagnetic clusters, jets). The tracks are selected according to the so-called 'good quality' criteria [9]:

* number of hits in silicon layers \(N_{Si}\geq 9\) (out of a maximum of 11);
* number of pixel hits \(N_{Pix}\geq 2\) (out of a maximum of 3);
* at least one hit in the B-layer;
* transverse impact parameter \(|d_{0}|<0.1\) cm.

The electron track candidates are selected using the following criteria:

* number of TRT straw hits \(N_{TRT}\geq 20\);
* at least one transition radiation hit (high pulse height TRT straw hit).

The background rejection and efficiency of the algorithm for single tracks are calculated with respect to the number of filtered tracks. The standard CBNT format is extended to contain the energy deposition in each EM Calorimeter cell surrounding the one pointed to by the reconstructed track. This information is recorded for each of the three longitudinal compartments of the EM Calorimeter.

### Event kinematics

#### 2.3.1 Jets

Unlike in previous studies [1], jets are identified as clusters in the combined electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters for this analysis. They are labelled as originating from a b-quark, if a quark with \(p_{T}^{b}>5\) GeV (after FSR) is found in a cone \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}~{}<~{}0.2\) around the jet direction and \(|\eta^{jet}|<2.5\). The labelling for \(c,u,g\)-jets is done in the same way.

Table 1 shows the mean transverse momentum of the reconstructed jets, \(<p_{T}^{j}>\) and the mean multiplicity of tracks with \(p_{T}>0.7\) GeV within the jet cone (\(\Delta R=0.4\)). An increase in the multiplicity of tracks by a factor of two is observed for jets with higher average \(<p_{T}^{j}>\) (\(m_{H}=400\) GeV sample) with respect to the lower \(<p_{T}^{j}>\) sample (\(m_{H}=100\) GeV).

The track multiplicity in jets is calculated using tracks passing the preselection only (see 2.2). The fraction of reconstructed jets with no tracks with \(p_{T}>0.7\) GeV within the jet cone is below 1%.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c||} \hline \hline Jet type & \(<p_{T}^{j}>\) [GeV] & \(<n^{track}>\) \\ \hline \hline \(b\)-jets & 51 (154) & 5.7 (9.3) \\ \hline \(g\)-jets & 55 (168) & 7.1 (13.5) \\ \hline \(u\)-jets & 53 (166) & 4.7 (8.5) \\ \hline \(c\)-jets & 51 (161) & 5.1 (8.9) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Average values of the jet transverse momentum, \(<p_{T}^{j}>\), and average values of the multiplicity of tracks in a cone \(\Delta R=0.4\) around the jet axis, \(<n^{track}>\), with a transverse momentum threshold \(p_{T}^{thr}~{}>~{}0.7\) GeV. The numbers are given for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV (\(m_{H}=400\) GeV) events.

#### 2.3.2 Electrons in jets

There are several sources of signal and background electrons present in jets [1, 13]. The signal (irreducible) electrons inside \(b\)-jets are coming from:

* semileptonic decays of \(B\) hadrons to electron (\(b\to e\));
* cascade decays of \(B\) hadron to \(D\) hadron and later to electron (\(b\to c\to e\));
* leptonic decays of \(J/\psi\) from \(b\) decays (\(b\to J/\psi\to e\));
* \(B\) hadron decays to \(\tau\) lepton and later to electron (\(b\to\tau\to e\)).

The background (reducible) electrons arise from the following processes:

* semileptonic decays in the hadronic cascade;
* \(\pi^{0}\) Dalitz decays (\(\pi^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\gamma\));
* \(\gamma\)-conversions in the Inner Detector material.

Electrons of the above-mentioned origins are expected both in \(b\)-jets and \(c\),\(u\),g-jets 4, but their population and kinematic features are different for different types of jets. The fraction of reconstructed jets containing electron tracks with \(p_{T}>2\) GeV and within the cone \(\Delta R\leq 0.4\) from the jet axis is given in Table 2 for all types of jets.

Footnote 4: for the criteria of jet labelling see section 2.3.1

The dominant source of electrons in the signal jets (\(b\)-jets) are electrons

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c|c|c|c|c||} \hline \hline Jet type & \multicolumn{4}{|c||}{Fraction of jets containing electrons [\%]} \\ \cline{2-6}  & \(\gamma\) conversions & \(\pi^{0}\) Dalitz & \(B\)-hadrons & \(D\)-hadrons & Other \\  & & & & & sources \\ \hline \hline \(b\)-jets & 3.0 (9.4) & 0.7 (1.8) & 7.6 (8.6) & 5.1 (6.7) & 0.5 (0.6) \\ \hline \(g\)-jets & 2.9 (8.7) & 0.8 (2.1) & 0.1 (0.4) & 0.4 (0.9) & 0.1 (0.3) \\ \hline \(c\)-jets & 3.0 (10.1) & 0.8 (2.1) & - ( - ) & 5.7 (7.2) & 0.1 (0.2) \\ \hline \(u\)-jets & 2.7 (9.2) & 0.7 (2.0) & - ( - ) & - (0.1) & 0.1 (0.1) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Fraction of jets with electrons of a given origin (with \(p_{T}>\ 2\) GeV and within \(\Delta R\leq 0.4\) from the jet axis ) in rapidity coverage \(|\eta|<2.5\). The numbers are given after the full detector simulation for events with \(m_{H}=100\) GeV and \(m_{H}=400\) GeV (in brackets).

from semileptonic decays of \(B\) hadrons (\(b\to e\)) and \(D\) hadrons (\(b\to c\to e\)). The semileptonic decays of \(D\) hadrons (\(c\to e\)) occur frequently in \(c\)-jets. The gluon jets have also a heavy-quark content, while \(u\)-jets are almost free from such electrons. In \(u\)- and g-jets the main sources of electrons are \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays.

The presence of any electron in the background jets makes their rejection difficult (as our method uses electrons as tagging particles). As can be concluded from Table 2 the best rejection factor can be achieved for \(u\)-jets and the worst for \(c\)-jets.

For events with \(m_{H}=400\) GeV an increase in number of electrons from \(\gamma\) conversion by a factor of three and electrons from Dalitz decays by a factor of two can be observed. For the signal electrons this increase is smaller (about 1.3).

Table 3 contains similar information as Table 2, but the composition of electrons is shown for jets reconstructed in the central rapidity range (\(|\eta|<0.3\) ) and for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV events only. The fraction of jets with electrons from \(\gamma\) conversions is smaller by a factor of two in the \(|\eta|<0.3\) range comparing with the full \(|\eta|\) range.

Table 4 shows the average values of the transverse momentum of electrons (from all mentioned sources) and of hadrons in various jets. A threshold on \(p_{T}^{track}>2\) GeV is used and only tracks inside a cone \(\Delta R\leq 0.4\) around a jet axis are considered. The numbers are given for tracks after reconstruction and preselection cuts. Particles inside reconstructed jets have average transverse momenta, up to 10 GeV for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV events and up to 19 GeV for \(m_{H}=400\) GeV. Electrons with the highest transverse momentum are present in \(b\)- and \(c\)-jets as originating from heavy \(B\) and \(D\) mesons semileptonic decays. In g- and \(u\)-jets electrons from \(\gamma\) conversions and Dalitz decays dominate, therefore the mean value of \(p_{T}\) for electrons is respectively lower.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c|c|c|c|c||} \hline \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Jet type} & \multicolumn{4}{c||}{Fraction of jets containing electrons [\%]} \\ \cline{2-6}  & \(\gamma\) conversions & \(\pi^{0}\) Dalitz & \(B\)-hadrons & \(D\)-hadrons & Other \\  & & & & & sources \\ \hline \hline \(b\)-jets & 1.7 & 0.4 & 6.7 & 5.7 & 0.3 \\ \hline \(g\)-jets & 1.5 & 0.5 & 0.1 & 0.6 & 0.1 \\ \hline \(c\)-jets & 1.5 & 0.7 & - & 5.4 & 0.1 \\ \hline \(u\)-jets & 1.2 & 0.6 & - & - & 0.1 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Similar to Table 2 but in small rapidity range \(|\eta|<0.3\) and for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV events only. The statistical error on those numbers is of the order of 20%.

The electrons from \(b\)-jets have a harder momentum spectrum than hadrons from \(u\)-, g- or \(c\)-jets.

As can be noticed comparing Table 1 and Table 4, the increase of the average \(<p_{T}^{j}>\) by a factor three increases average momenta of hadron and electron tracks by a factor of two. Figure 1 shows the ratio between the normalised pseudorapidity distributions of signal electrons from \(b\)-jets and of all \(b\)-jets (\(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample) and the similar ratio for electrons from background \(u\)-jets and all \(u\)-jets (\(H\to u\bar{u}\) sample). As can be concluded the pseudorapidity of electrons from \(u\)-jets is less correlated with the pseudorapidity of \(u\)-jets (in contrast to the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) jets) but rather with the amount of material in the inner detector (the ratio is higher in the larger pseudorapidity region).

As electrons from semileptonic direct and cascade decays of \(B\) hadrons are crucial for the soft electron method of \(b\)-tagging, the relatively small branching ratio of \(b\to e\) is a serious limitation of this method. The fraction of reconstructed \(b\)-jets with an electron within a cone \(\Delta R\leq 0.4\) around the jet axis is defined as the effective branching ratio \(BR\). This value is normalised to the total number of reconstructed \(b\)-labelled jets with \(p_{T}^{b-jet}\ >15\) GeV.

In contrast to the previous studies, where particle level information was involved, in the present analysis the reconstructed electron track in the \(b\)-jet is used. The new estimates are shown in Figure 2 for events with \(m_{H}=100\) GeV and 400 GeV, for different cuts on electron track \(p_{T}\) and in the full and central pseudorapidity ranges. For electron tracks with \(p_{T}>2.0\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) this fraction is respectively \(BR_{100}=16.4\%\) (for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV) and \(BR_{400}=24.6\%\) (for \(m_{H}=400\) GeV). However using particle level information as in [1], one would obtain, for the same threshold on the electron transverse momentum and pseudorapidity, \(BR_{100}^{gen}=14.5\%\) and \(BR_{400}^{gen}=19.5\%\). The differences are due to electrons from \(\gamma\) conversions and to smaller extent, due to the lower efficiency for track reconstruction

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c c|c c||} \hline \hline Jet type & \multicolumn{4}{c||}{\(<p_{T}>\)} & [GeV] \\ \cline{2-5}  & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{electrons} & \multicolumn{2}{c||}{hadrons} \\ \hline \hline \(b\)-jets & 10.2 & (18.8) & 7.2 & (12.9) \\ \hline \(c\)-jets & 8.2 & (14.5) & 8.2 & (14.8) \\ \hline \(g\)-jets & 5.6 & (9.4) & 6.7 & (10.8) \\ \hline \(u\)-jets & 7.6 & (12.2) & 9.1 & (16.7) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

and acceptance of preselection criteria. For comparison with estimates in [1], the same distributions are shown without electrons from \(\gamma\) conversion on Figure 3, giving \(BR_{100}^{noconv}=13.8\%\) and \(BR_{400}^{noconv}=17.0\%\) for electron tracks with \(p_{T}>2.0\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\).

The fraction of electrons from conversions becomes substantial at large rapidity and large transverse momenta. Such an enhancement of electrons from conversions happens both in signal and background jets, just making the rejection of background jets more difficult.

For the final evaluation of \(b\)-tagging performance the estimates on \(BR_{100}\) and \(BR_{400}\), presented in Figure 2, for the data samples generated at \(m_{H}=100\) GeV and \(m_{H}=400\) GeV were used.

Electron tracks from conversions are not included. The left plot is for jets in full rapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\), the right one for jets with \(|\eta|<0.3\).

Electron identification

### Electron identification variables

Using information from the Inner Detector (provided by xKalman and xConver) and the EM Calorimeter, a set of variables is constructed to efficiently identify reconstructed tracks as electrons and to reject other tracks. These variables can be classified as following:

Variables using Inner Detector information only:

* number of high-energy hits (TR hits) in the TRT detector along the track.

Variables using EM Calorimeter information (based on the track impact position):

* fraction of the energy deposited in the first longitudinal compartment of the EM Calorimeter,
* fraction of the energy deposited in the third longitudinal compartment of the EM Calorimeter,
* shower isolation in the EM Calorimeter from the ratio of energy deposited in the 3x3 and 3x7 window around the cell with maximum energy deposition summed over the three samplings of the EM Calorimeter,
* energy weighted width of the shower in three strips measured in units of distance between the strips 5. Footnote 5: The width variable is corrected for the impact point in the first layer of the EM Calorimeter.

Variables using combined information from the Inner Detector and the EM Calorimeter:

* ratio of the transverse energy deposited in the EM Calorimeter to the transverse momentum reconstructed in the Inner Detector,
* difference between the track and shower positions measured in units of distance between the strips (from \(\pm\) 7 strips around predicted strip).

For more details see [1].

Figure 4 shows the normalised distributions of these variables. They are efficient for discriminating electrons against other particles (mostly pions).

Figure 4: Normalised distributions of the variables used to identify electron (shaded histogram) and non-electron tracks (open histogram). Plots are for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV events and for \(|\eta|<2.5\).

### Rejection of \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays of neutral pions

For the \(b\)-tagging with soft electron method it is very important to distinguish between signal electrons from semileptonic decays of \(B\) and \(D\) mesons and electrons originating from \(\gamma\)-conversions and Dalitz decays of neutral pions (\(\pi^{o}\to e^{+}e^{-}\gamma\)). For the suppression of such tracks which might be classified by the \(b\)-tagging algorithm as signal electron tracks, the following four discriminating variables are used:

* Number of hits in silicon (\(N_{Si}\geq 9\)), at least one hit in the \(B\)-layer and at least two in the pixels (already used for the preselection in the ntuple);
* The value of the \(\chi^{2}\) fit (xConver package). The fit is performed assuming a common vertex and a zero opening angle between the tracks, which are candidates for a converted pair. All tracks with \(\chi^{2}<200\) are rejected by the tagging algorithm.

### Characteristics of tracks in b-jets

Figure 5: Normalised distributions of the transverse impact parameter \(d_{0}\) and \(p_{T}\) of the track with respect to the jet axis \(P_{TJ}\). White – signal electron tracks in \(b\)-jets, shaded – all tracks in non-\(b\) jets. Plots are for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV events and for \(|\eta|<2.5\).

There are two additional variables characterising some global features of tracks coming from \(b\)-jets. Since a \(b\)-jet is reconstructed from the hadronic cascade containing a heavy and long-living \(B\)-hadron, one expects that many of its charged tracks will have significant impact parameter \(d_{0}\) (long lifetime) and also large \(p_{T}\) with respect to the jet axis, \(P_{TJ}\), (decay of a heavy object). In Figure 5 the \(d_{0}\) and \(P_{TJ}\) distributions are shown for signal electron tracks from \(B\) and \(D\) mesons in \(b\)-jets, and for other charged tracks in non-\(b\) jets. The \(d_{0}\) variable is strongly correlated with the one used by the vertexing algorithm [2, 14].

### Construction of the discriminating function

The distributions of the continuous variables shown in Figures 4 and 5 (\(E_{1}/E\), \(E_{3}/E\), \(ISO\), \(W\), \(POS\), \(E_{T}/P_{T}\), \(P_{TJ}\) and \(d_{0}\)) are treated as the probability density functions and smoothed using the PAW smoothing procedure [15]. The only exception is \(N_{TR}\) for which a look-up table is prepared. For \(\chi^{2}_{CONV}\) a threshold is defined (tracks with \(\chi^{2}_{CONV}<200\) are rejected).

The probability distributions of the identifying variables show a significant dependence on the pseudorapidity and the transverse momentum of the track. Therefore the probability density distributions and the look-up-tables are calculated in 5 pseudorapidity bins:

\[(0,\ 0.8);\ \ (0.8,\ 1.4);\ \ (1.4,\ 1.8);\ \ (1.8,\ 2.0);\ \ (2.0,\ 2.5).\]

The optimisation of the discriminating threshold in \(p_{T}\) bins is not feasible because of low statistics. The threshold on the transverse momentum of the track is set to \(p_{T}>\ 2\) GeV in all bins. In Figure 6 and 7, as example, the \(E_{T}/p_{T}\) variable is shown as a function of \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\). The distributions vary much more strongly in \(\eta\) than with \(p_{T}\). The suppression of the discrimination capability in the third bin (\(1.4<|\eta|\leq 1.8\)) is due to the transition between the barrel and the end-cap regions of the electromagnetic calorimeter where a lot of dead material is present (cryostat walls, cables etc.).

The probability distributions differ for events from heavier and lighter Higgs. In Figure 8 the dependence of number of high TRT hits is shown for signal electrons from \(b\)-jets and pions from background samples. Comparing to \(m_{H}=100\) GeV, distributions for pions from \(m_{H}=400\) GeV samples are extended towards higher numbers of TR hits, which makes the \(e/\pi\) separation more difficult. The extension is due to the transition radiation effect for faster pions.

Figure 6: Normalised distributions of the ratio of the transverse energy deposited in the EM Calorimeter to the transverse momentum reconstructed in the Inner Detector \(E_{T}/p_{T}\) in 5 \(\eta\) bins. White – signal electron tracks in \(b\)-jets, dashed – non electron tracks in non-\(b\) jets. Plots are for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV.

Figure 7: Normalised distributions of the ratio of the transverse energy deposited in the EM Calorimeter to the transverse momentum reconstructed in the Inner Detector \(E_{T}/p_{T}\) in 3 \(p_{T}\) bins. White – signal electron tracks in \(b\)-jets, dashed – non electron tracks in non-\(b\) jets. Plots are for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV and and for \(|\eta|<2.5\).

For each track the discriminating function \(D_{track}\) is calculated:

\[D_{track}=log\frac{\prod_{i}P_{e}(x_{i})}{\prod_{i}P_{h}(x_{i})}.\]

where \(x_{i}\) denotes the value of the \(i\)-th variable for the given track, \(P_{e}(x_{i})\) is the probability that the track originates from a signal electron, \(P_{h}(x_{i})\) is the probability that the track originates from non-signal hadron and \(i\) runs through all the variables used by the algorithm.

A higher rejection power can be achieved by the algorithm if, for tracks with transverse momentum below 4 GeV, the value of \(D_{track}\) is rescaled as follows:

\[D_{track}\to D_{track}+2.5\times p_{T}-10.0\]

where \(p_{T}\) is the transverse momentum of the reconstructed track given in GeV. Even if there is no straightforward motivation for this rescaling, it is effective in rejecting the low-\(p_{T}\) background electron tracks from Dalitz decays and \(\gamma\)-conversions.

### Electron identification efficiency

Figure 9 shows the distribution of the discriminating function \(D_{track}\) for various types of tracks: signal electrons in \(b\)-jets, background electrons and charged pions from the non-\(b\) jets.

A threshold on the value of \(D_{track}\) is used for the separation of signal electron tracks from other tracks. The shape of the \(D_{track}\) variable is very different for pions and for background electrons. It is much more similar for signal and background electrons. The identification of a signal electron

candidate is based on the \(D_{track}\) value of the the given track. The tracks with \(D_{track}\) below threshold are rejected. The identification efficiency versus the rejection power of the algorithm is obtained by varying the value of \(D_{track}^{cut}\). The rejections obtained for pions and for electrons from conversions in various types of jets are presented in Table 5 and in Figure 10. The rejection factors are given with respect to 'good quality tracks' (section 2.2) and with the threshold on the track transverse momentum \(p_{T}>2\) GeV.

## 4 B-jet tagging

### Jet tagging procedure

The jet tagging method is based on the electron identification procedure:

* for each track in the jet the value of the discriminating function \(D_{track}\) is calculated;
* for each jet the track with the highest value of \(D_{track}\) is chosen and its value of the discriminating function is taken as the value of the discriminating function for the jet, \(D_{jet}~{}=~{}max(D_{track})\);
* for a given threshold \(D_{jet}^{thr}\) a jet with \(D_{jet}\geq D_{jet}^{thr}\) is tagged as a \(b\)-jet.

Figure 11 shows the distributions of \(D_{jet}\) for \(g\)-, \(u\)- and \(c\)- jets. The distribution for \(b\)-jets is shown only for jets with an electron from semileptonic \(b\) decay inside the jet cone.

Figure 11: Normalised distribution of \(D_{jet}\) for various types of jets: \(b\)-jets filtered for generated electrons (solid), gluon jets (bold dashed), \(u\)-jets (dashed), \(c\)-jets (dotted). Only tracks with reconstructed transverse momentum \(p_{T}>2\) GeV are used for the \(b\)-tagging algorithm. Plots are shown for events with \(m_{H}=100\) GeV (left) and \(m_{H}=400\) GeV (right).

### Efficiency of b-jets identification

The efficiency of soft lepton \(b\)-tagging is defined as

\[\epsilon_{b}^{soft}=\frac{N_{b}^{t}}{N_{b}},\]

where \(N_{b}^{t}\) is the number of tagged \(b\)-jets in the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sample, and \(N_{b}\) is the number of reconstructed \(b\)-jets in the sample, with at least one reconstructed track with \(p_{T}^{track}>0.7\) GeV inside the jet cone.

The jet rejection factor is calculated as following:

\[R_{jet}=\frac{N_{j}}{N_{j}^{t}},\]

where \(j\) is a given jet type (\(g\),\(u\),\(c\)), \(N_{j}\) is the number of reconstructed jets of type \(j\) in the \(H\to j\bar{j}\) sample with at least one track (\(p_{T}^{track}>0.7\) GeV) inside the jet cone, and \(N_{j}^{t}\) is the number of reconstructed \(j\)-type jets tagged as \(b\)-jets.

The numbers are calculated for a threshold on transverse momentum of the track \(p_{T}>2\) GeV. \(\epsilon_{b}^{soft}\) corresponds to the nominal working point, \(i.e.\) efficiency of the algorithm \(\epsilon_{b}^{alg}=50\%\).

Figure 12 shows the rejection factors for various types of jets as a function of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV and 400 GeV samples. The nominal working point: 50% efficiency of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm and \(p_{T}^{track}>2\) GeV, corresponds to rejection factors extracted for \(\epsilon_{b}^{100}=8.2\%\) for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV (\(BR_{100}=16.4\%\)) and \(\epsilon_{b}^{400}=12.3\%\) for \(m_{H}=400\) GeV (\(BR_{400}=24.6\%\)). The achieved rejection factors for non-\(b\) jets are presented in Table 6.

The rejection for various types of jets shows a strong dependence on the pseudorapidity of the tagged jet. Figure 13 shows the rejection factors as functions of \(\eta\) for efficiency of \(b\)-tagging algorithm 50%, \(i.e.\)\(\epsilon_{b}^{100}=8.2\%\) (\(m_{H}=100\) GeV) and \(\epsilon_{b}^{400}=12.3\%\) (\(m_{H}=400\) GeV) and the threshold on the transverse momentum of the track \(p_{T}^{track}>2\) GeV.

Figure 14 shows the rejection factors as functions of the threshold on track \(p_{T}\), for an efficiency of \(b\)-tagging algorithm 50%. As can be concluded, the best results for rejection can be achieved by setting the track \(p_{T}\) threshold on 2-4 GeV for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV events and 4-5 GeV for \(m_{H}=400\) GeV events.

Table 7 shows the fraction of jets tagged

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:25]

Conclusions

For the nominal working point (50% efficiency of the \(b\)-tagging algorithm) the following rejection factors for non-\(b\) jets are achieved:

* for \(m_{H}=100\) GeV events \(\epsilon_{b}^{100}=8.2\%\quad R_{g}=209\pm 34\)\(R_{u}=470\pm 92\)\(R_{c}=44\pm 3\)
* for \(m_{H}=400\) GeV events \(\epsilon_{b}^{400}=12.3\%\quad R_{g}=43\pm 3\)\(R_{u}=55\pm 3\)\(R_{c}=22\pm 1\)

The rejection factors obtained in this study for the full rapidity region are almost comparable to the values presented previously [1] for the central pseudorapidity range. Additionally the present rejection factors estimated for \(|\eta|<0.3\), (see Figure 13), are much better than those given in [1]. It should be noted, however, that so far the electronic noise is included in the reconstruction of the EM Calorimeter information but not the pile-up effects. This will degrade the overall tagging performance as indicated in [2]. However the following improvements of the presented results should be possible with larger statistics studies:

* optimisation in the \(p_{T}\) bins;
* a new conversion finding algorithm, more efficient than XConver, as electrons from \(\gamma\) conversions contributing substantially to mistagging \(u\)-jets;
* calculation of probability density function \(N_{TR}\) (number of TR hits) as a function of the particle momentum;
* choosing the threshold on the \(p_{T}\) of the tracks used in the \(b\)-tagging algorithm as a function of the jet transverse momentum as signal electrons from semileptonic decays have a fixed average fraction of a B-meson momentum, but background electrons from conversions have a softer spectrum;
* study of the correlations beetwen identyfing variables.

The algorithm used for the present analysis can be combined with the vertex algorithm to improve the overall ATLAS \(b\)-tagging performance. The first such studies are presented in [2].
