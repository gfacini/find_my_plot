ABSTRACT

This note presents the results of a study of the detection sensitivity for the intermediate mass Higgs with ATLAS detector through four muon final state. A full detector simulation and event reconstruction using the ATLAS muon spectrometer has been performed.

Introduction

Spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model gives rise to a fundamental massive neutral scalar particle, the Higgs boson (\(H^{0}\)). In the standard model the couplings of the Higgs boson to the fermions and the vector bosons are known, but the Higgs mass is not specified. Higgs searches have been performed at LEP (Large Electron-Positron Collider). So far the results of the searches have been negative, and the symmetry breaking mechanism remains mysterious. The current lower mass limit of the Higgs is \(\sim\)70 GeV [1]. It is expected that LEP II can reach the Higgs search limit up to \(M_{H}\sim 90\) GeV [2]. The Higgs search will remain a central topic of experimental high energy physics during the coming decade. The continuation of the search for the Higgs particle will be one of the main objectives of the LHC physics program.

Much work has been carried out to understand the Higgs discovery potential of the ATLAS detector [3] for the LHC. This note reports the results of a study of the detection sensitivity for the intermediate mass Higgs (130 GeV \(<M_{H^{0}}<\) 180 GeV) with ATLAS detector through four muon final state. Different from the previous studies, this study has been performed using a full detector simulation and event reconstruction with the ATLAS muon spectrometer. Our study confirmed that the ATLAS muon spectrometer performance will be achieved as described in the Technical Proposal (TP) and submitted in 1994 [4].

## 2 Simulation Programs and Event Samples

The Higgs and background events were generated using PYTHIA program [5] with two proton beams colliding at a center-of-mass energy of 14 TeV. The process cross sections and event samples used in this study are listed in Table 1a and 1b. One should notice that:

* The listed values of cross-section times the branching ratio (\(\sigma\times BR\)) for Higgs events were corrected using the values quoted in an ATLAS Physics note [6].
* The value of the \(\sigma\times BR\) for \(ZZ^{*}\) background has been increased by a factor of 1.3 to account for the gluon-gluon fusion contributions since the PYTHIA program doesn't include this interaction.
* The \(Zb\overline{b}\) process in PYTHIA is not usable to generate large statistical event sample due to an inappropriate treatment of the phase space. The background estimation from this channel has used results from previous studies [7].

Higgs event generation and reconstruction were carried out with full detector simulation. The detector simulation program used in this study is a GEANT-based package, LHCTOR [8]. The muon detector layout including the toroid coils of the magnet are modeled in detail, but we used simplified descriptions of the inner tracker and calorimeters. All the physics processes for particles interacting with the detector, such as \(\delta\)-ray production and dE/dx energy loss, are operative for all the simulations. Muon detector digitization and muon track reconstruction were performed using program MUONBOX [9]. This package takes account of the detector inefficiencies chamber resolutions and alignment errors (for both precision tracking device (MDTs) and trigger detectors). Nominal background random hits are also included during the 'digitization' process. Under simulated realistic conditions, MUONBOX performs the muon track pattern recognition and momentum reconstruction in muon chambers. Back-fitting of the muon tracks was carried out using program BMCBOX [10]. This program performs the back-tracking of the muons to the IP (Interaction Point) while adding back the energy loss due to \(dE/dx\) and radiation to the reconstructed muon momentum using muon chamber data alone. In addition, the kinematic constraint of the \(Z^{0}\) mass was performed using MINUIT program package [11] to improve the Higgs mass resolution. Figure 1a-1c show the reconstructed Higgs mass distributions for Higgs mass of 130 GeV, 150 GeV and 170 GeV, respectively.

Typical non-Gaussian tails of these distributions are about 15%. These tails are mostly due to missing multi-layer hits in the muon detection because of the muon detector geometric acceptance.

Due to CPU limitations, background studies were carried out using a fast simulation package, ATLFAST [12] with very large event samples. The background study performed here provides an independent cross-check of the background contributions for the previous studies done by O. Linossier and L. Poggioli [7]. In their studies the background rejection were carried out using full detector simulations of the ATLAS inner detector. Therefore, for our final detection sensitivity calculations we have used the estimated background quoted in [7].

## 3 Event Selection and Efficiency

We have followed the event selection strategy described in the ATLAS TP to identify the Higgs events and to reject the background. The selection criteria are listed below.

1. **Kinematic requirements** The following kinematic selection cuts were designed to match the muon triggers and to reject the \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Z^{0}b\overline{b}\) background: 1. Rapidity cut for each muon: \(|\eta_{\mu}|<2.7\). 2. Transverse momentum, \(P_{T}^{\mu}\), for each muon should be greater than 7 GeV, and at least two muons should have \(P_{T}^{\mu}\) greater than 20 GeV. 3. The di-muon invariant mass of one selected pair of muons should be consistent with the \(Z^{0}\) mass: \(|M_{\mu\mu}-M_{Z^{0}}|<6\) GeV. 4. The other pair of the muons should have the invariant mass greater than 20 GeV. The detection efficiencies obtained from the full simulations and reconstructions for different Higgs masses are listed in Table 2, ranged from 27% to 56.7% for the masses between 130 GeV to 170 GeV.
2. **Isolation requirement** The \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Z^{0}b\overline{b}\) background contains muons decay from \(b/c\) quark jets, thus are not isolated. We required all the muons in the final states should be isolated in a cone of radius \(R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.2\) around the muon track. The signal efficiency for applying the isolation cut using the calorimeters in ATLFAST is greater than 98%. More realistic study using inner tracker to perform the isolation cut gives 90% detection efficiency at low luminosity (\(3\times 10^{33}/cm^{2}/sec\)),

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

\(t\bar{t}\) background samples, the following were found. a) The \(ZZ^{\star}\) background contributes 36.5 events for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) in the mass range 110 - 180 GeV at the low luminosity. This background corresponds to 0.52 event per GeV in mass distribution. b) \(\sim\) 0.02 event per GeV in mass distribution come from the \(t\bar{t}\) process for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The summed background from the \(zb\bar{b}\) process is three times the \(t\bar{t}\) background, implying the overall background between 110-180 GeV is 0.6 events/GeV in the mass distributions. One should notice that these background rates don't include the rejection power using the impact parameter requirement and these estimates are about a factor of 2 higher than the background rate quoted in the ATLAS note, PHYS-NO-101.

## 4 Higgs Detection Sensitivity

In this section we present our calculations of the Higgs detection sensitivities through four muon final state for low and high luminosities. The expected Higgs events produced at the LHC with \(10^{5}\) luminosity are taken from Table 1. The signal detection efficiencies are derived from Table 2. In addition a 9% signal reduction is used in order to take into account the inner bremsstrahlung process at the generator level (since PYTHIA program doesn't include such process). The background events are estimated using the numbers listed in Table 2 of the ATLAS note, PHYS-NO-101, and normalized for \(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) luminosity (both for low- and high-luminosity). Sensitivity is defined as \(S/\sqrt{B}\), where \(S\) denotes the number of accepted signal events within the mass region of \(M\pm 2\sigma_{M}\), and \(B\), the number of accepted background events in the same mass region as the signal.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \multicolumn{4}{c}{**Table 3a: Higgs detection sensitivity**} \\ \cline{2-4} through \(pp\to ZZ^{\star}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) at high luminosity \\ \hline \(M_{H}\) & Signal & Background & \(S/\sqrt{B}\) \\ (GeV) & (for \(10^{5}\)) & (for \(10^{5}\)) & \\ \hline
130 & 8.5 & 2.7 & 5.2 \\
140 & 19.6 & 1.7 & 15.0 \\
150 & 28.3 & 1.9 & 20.5 \\
160 & 14.7 & 1.8 & 11.0 \\
170 & 8.8 & 1.9 & 6.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Table 3a and 3b list the expected Higgs events and background for different masses, and the detection significances at high- and the low-luminosity, respectively.

Another way to define the Higgs detection sensitivity is to define required luminosity for a 5\(\sigma\) discovery criteria, namely, the probability for a false discovery claim is less than 2.9\(\times 10^{-5}\). Fig. 2a shows the required integrated luminosity for discovery versus the Higgs mass at high luminosity. Fig. 2b shows the required integrated luminosity for discovery versus the Higgs mass at low luminosity.

## 5 Conclusion

Our simulations of the intermediate mass Higgs detection sensitivities through the four muon final state show that the ATLAS muon spectrometer offers a good discovery potential in agreement with the earlier studies included in the ATLAS TP. We are confident that the ATLAS muon detector will have a good chance of observing the Higgs scalar with a clean signature in the Higgs mass region greater than 130 GeV.

Detailed studies of full simulations combining the measurements from the inner tracker and from the muon spectrometer will be carried out in the near future. We expect that non-Gaussian tails in the mass distributions will decrease thereby improving our detection sensitivity.
