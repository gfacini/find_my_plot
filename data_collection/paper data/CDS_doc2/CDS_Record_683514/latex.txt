Footnote 1: This note is the result of calculations and measurements of several institutes. A detailed list of the institutes participating in ATLAS muon detector physics activities is given in the appendix. For further information contact W. Mohr (mohr@hpfrs2.physik.uni-freiburg.de), Michael Treichel (treichel@vxcern.cern.ch) or G. Viehhauser (viehhaus@cernvm.cern.ch).

This note explains the considerations for the choice of the operating point of the ATLAS MDT muon precision chamber. We review the arguments for the pressure and the diameter of the tubes and present the arguments which define the requirements on the operating gas gain.

A main topic of this note is the question of MDT chamber lifetime. We present results of measurements that indicate that the streamer rate, a property potentially dangerous for chamber aging, can be kept sufficiently low at gas gains which can be used for the final MDT operating point. We have found sets of gases, which, apart from their low streamer rate, show also satisfying drift properties in calculations with MAGBOLTZ and GARFIELD.

We give an overview about existing experience with wire chamber aging and present our own efforts to study the behavior of MDTs under high irradiation.

1. Motivation

One of the main tasks of the ATLAS Muon Detector Physics Group is to provide the muon group with the informations needed for the choice of the operating point of the MDT precision chambers. In particular, this choice has to ensure the ability to survive 10 years of operation in the high-rate LHC environment. This note summarizes our understanding of this topic. It gives an overview over the present knowledge and shows our approach towards finding a satisfactory solution.

2. Background

A main parameter which influences the choice of the operating point for the MDTs is the counting rate in the tubes. Background calculations which include the setup of the ATLAS detector as described in the technical proposal, have been performed. The expected counting rates in the MDTs as a function of rapidity are given in fig. 1.

Regions with particular high counting rates are in the inner station at \(\eta=0.7\), where at present the gap between the barrel and the endcap calorimeters allows particles to escape, and again in the inner station, at rapidities \(\eta>1.6\). The optimization of the crack between the calorimeters is the subject of an ATLAS wide effort with the aim to reduce the background significantly.

Figure 1: Counting rates in the MDT as a function of rapidity in a) the inner muon station, b) the middle muon station.

Cathode Strip Chambers have been chosen as the precision chamber technology for the endcap region to avoid counting rates which are potentially dangerous for the operation or the lifetime of the MDTs. The rapidity at which the technology will change will be defined once the limit of the high rate operation of the MDT is established.

Due to the uncertainties in background calculations the ATLAS muon group has decided to apply a safety factor of 5 to all background dependent parameters. That means that the MDTs have to safely operate over the running time of the experiment in a background 5 times higher than the currently anticipated.

3. Gas gain operating window

The operating window for the MDT is defined in terms of gas gain.

The upper limit of the operating gas gain is given by the lifetime of the MDTs. In our present understanding aging is related to the integrated deposited charge per wire length

\[Q=r\cdot d\cdot\left<N_{e}\right>\cdot G\cdot e\cdot t\]

with: r: counting rate

d: tube diameter

\(\left<N_{e}\right>\): average number of primary electrons

G: gas gain

t: running time

The average number of electrons is given by the number of primary electrons per unit length and the average track length in a tube

\[\left<x\right>=2\frac{\int_{0}^{r_{0}}\sqrt{r_{0}^{2}-rdr}}{r_{0}}=\frac{\pi}{ 2}r_{0}.\]

The situation for the number of primary electrons per unit length is less clear. Calculations following [1] would yield about 275 e/cm, whereas the data presented in [2] would indicate a number about 220 e/cm. For our calculation we will assume a value of 300 e/cm. This gives combined with the average tracklength in the MDT \(\left<N_{e}\right>=700e\).

Then the integrated deposited charge for minimum ionizing particles in the regions with the highest radiation environment (see discussion in previous section) at nominal luminosity with the parameters

\[r=100\frac{Hz}{cm^{2}},\ d=3\ cm,\ \left<N_{e}\right>=700e,\ G=2\times 10^{4},\ t=10^{8}s\]

is \(Q=0.067C/cm\). The choice of this gas gain will be justified in the subsequent discussion. In the final setup the integrated deposited charge will be higher due to the higher primary ionization produced by neutrons and photons, which dominate the background and counting rates. Background calculations indicate that these particles have, averaged over the energy spectrum, a primary ionization yield which is higher by a factor 2 than the one for minimum ionizing ones. This gives an integrated deposited charge of \(Q=0.13C/cm\) over 10 years LHC at nominal luminosity.

Streamer signals have to be avoided as already small fractions of streamer pulses increase the integrated deposited charge significantly. If the charge in a streamer pulse is 100 times higher than in the proportional avalanche a fraction of 1% streamer would double the integrated deposited charge.

Finally we apply a safety factor of 5 to account for uncertainties in the background calculations, possibly higher luminosity and bad surprises. We therefore require that the MDTs have to be designed to survive \(Q=0.67C/cm\) such that we are sure that they will survive 10 years of LHC operation. As the main part of the muon spectrometer is irradiated by particle fluxes considerably smaller than the ones in the worst case scenario anticipated above, most of the MDTs will at nominal background be exposed to an integrated deposited charge which is at least a factor 20 lower than this value.

The lowest possible gas gain is defined by the interplay of noise, discriminator threshold and shaping time. The noise of the MDT readout electronics is composed of the serial noise of the termination resistor (380 \(\Omega\)) and the parallel noise of the preamplifier. The ENC (Equivalent noise charge) of the electronics as a function of the termination resistance is given in fig. 2.

We require a discriminator threshold five times higher than the electronic noise, which gives the defining equation for the lower gas gain limit:

\[G_{min}=\frac{5\cdot ENC}{Q_{thr}},\]

where ENC is the total equivalent noise charge and \(Q_{thr}\) the primary ionization charge corresponding to the discriminator threshold. This charge is given by the electron on which the discriminator threshold is set and the fraction \(f_{coll}\) of the charge per electron which is collected during the shaping time, \(Q_{thr}=N_{e}\cdot f_{coll}\). In the case of the MDT this fraction is small as the characteristic time constant \(t_{0}\) of the chamber is large due to the low ion mobility in the pressurized gas (Tab. 1). The ratio of \(f_{coll}\) divided by the ENC defines the minimum gas gain and is depending on the shaping time. The ratio of the two is improving for longer shaping times. The fraction of the collected charge is increasing for smaller wire diameters. This is one reason for preferring a smaller wire (diameter = 50 \(\mu\)m).

Figure 2: ENC as a function of the termination resistance for a shaping time of 14 ns.

The last parameter determining the lower gas gain limit is the average number of electrons on which the discriminator fires. This parameter defines also the single wire resolution of the tube. The weak dependence of the resolution on the discriminator threshold (fig. 2) allows to optimize the discriminator level to reduce the integrated deposited charge. For a gas gain of 2\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\) the lowest discriminator threshold would be at around the 25th electron. A gas gain of 5\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\) on the other hand would allow for an effective discriminator threshold at around the 10th electron, with a 30% gain in single wire resolution.

Figure 2: Average resolution as a function of the gas gain. The discriminator threshold is 5 times higher than the noise. The shaping time is 20 ns.

4. The choice of pressure

There are two principal reasons to choose pressurized drift cells for the ATLAS Muon precision chamber. One reason is that it provides a multihit-capability, which is of considerable advantage in reducing the 'effective' occupancy in the drift cells and in identifying spurious hits due to 8-rays. Useful two-track resolution - at the level of \(\Delta\) = 3 mm - is only possible in pressurized cells with p > 3 bar. A further reason is the potential of very good single-wire resolution [3]. The latter criterion might however also be reached to a considerable extent by choosing cold drift gases (e.g. Ar/CO\({}_{2}\)) at atmospheric pressures.

We have performed calculations of the resolution for different pressures by keeping the integrated deposited charge from minimum ionizing particles constant. This requirement allows to increase the gas gain for lower pressures, thus allowing to set the discriminator threshold to a more favorable, namely earlier, electron. The results of these calculations are presented in figure 3. Decreasing the pressure would result in a significant performance loss even without any gain in the integrated deposited charge of the current seen by the tube. Every decrease of the integrated deposited charge would require further reduction of the gas gain and with it a higher effective discriminator threshold, resulting in an even higher performance loss above the one presented here.

In addition only the integrated deposited charge for minimum ionizing particles scales with the pressure. Photons with several 10 keV, which give a main contribution of the background signals, deposit all their energy in the tube, independent of the pressure. Thus the reduction of the integrated deposited charge for lower pressures is probably significantly reduced.

For higher pressures than 3 bar, on the other hand, the integrated deposited charge increases faster than the pressure, as the probability of streamer signals is rising with pressure.

Given the requirement of two-track resolution, a range of 3 to 5 bar for the pressure should be considered. We find little difference in the resolution for pressures higher than 3 bar as the working pressure.

5. The choice of the tube diameter

Decreasing the tube diameter \(d\) would decrease the integrated deposited charge from minimum ionizing particles as it is proportional to \(d\)[2] (both the primary charge and the exposed surface scale with the diameter). However, there are serious arguments against this.

The resolution near the wire is dominated by the distribution of the primary clusters along the track (fig. 4) which gives a worse resolution in this region than for larger radii, where diffusion is dominating. In the case of a reduced tube diameter the resolution average over the drift distance would become dominated by this effect. Due to the high effective discriminator threshold, which is necessary to allow for a moderate gas gain, this would result in a deterioration of the average resolution. The same effect would increase the overall inefficiency which is dominated by primary charge fluctuations close to the anode and the cathode. An additional layer of tubes, increasing the number of readout channels even further, might become necessary.

Figure 3: Resolution for different pressures. The parameters for the calculation are: gas mixture Ar/C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\)/N\({}_{2}\) 90/5/5, 20 ns shaping time, ENC = 5900e. The pressure dependent parameters are: Gas gain collected charge threshold [e]

1 bar 6\(\times 10^{4}\) 9.6% 6

2 bar 3\(\times 10^{4}\) 8.1% 15

3 bar 2\(\times 10^{4}\) 6.6% 24

4 bar 1.5\(\times 10^{4}\) 6.3% 32

5 bar 1.2\(\times 10^{4}\) 6.1% 40Increasing the tube diameter would improve the average efficiency and resolution. However, the total integrated charge, which limits the lifetime, increases quadratically with the tube diameter, as does the occupancy which is proportional to the product of the exposed surface and the maximum drift time.

Finally, a diameter of 3 cm appears not only to be the optimum from the detector physics point of view, but also the most cost effective solution as the cost of the MDT systems scales approximately with the number of tubes.

6. Gas gain studies

In the following two sections we will discuss data which were collected for a number of possible drift gases for the ATLAS MDT from measurements and calculations. This chapter will concentrate on measurements of gas gain and streamer rate, whereas in the next chapter we will discuss calculations of the drift properties like drift velocity, Lorentz angle and finally the r-t relation. For the final choice of the gas and operating point of the ATLAS MDT other data like resolution or efficiency are also needed. In the time schedule of the detector physics group these

The derivatives of the r-t relation on the operating parameters in the first four lines of table 3 give a measure of the linearity of the r-t relation. This linearity is important to keep biases to the position measurement small. If we fold the derivatives with the expected variations of these parameters inside an area, for which one autocalibration is performed (\(\sigma_{\mathrm{T}}\leq 1\) K, \(\sigma_{\mathrm{p}}\leq 5\) Torr, \(\sigma_{\mathrm{V}}\leq 5\) V, cathode displacement \(\leq 100\) \(\mu\)m), we see, that all the gases given introduce a bias which is less than 30 \(\mu\)m.

The dependence of the r-t relation on the magnetic field has to be treated differently as the variations in the ATLAS toroid are too large to be neglected in the calibration. The values given in the table can then be translated in required measurement accuracy of the magnetic field \(\sigma_{B}=\sigma_{T}/aB\), which must be in the order of 70 G/T for Ar/CO\({}_{2}\)/C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\)/N\({}_{2}\) 86/4/5/5 and scaled accordingly for the other gases.

The drift time for all the gases listed in tab. 3 is below 600 ns, which keeps the occupancy sufficiently low.

As mentioned above, the main components of the muon chamber gas will likely be argon, CO\({}_{2}\) and methane, the latter two gases on a few-percent level. Similar gas mixtures have been used and tested for their aging properties by several other groups before:

* The TASSO vertex chamber (D. Binnie, in J. Kadyk, Proceedings of the Workshop to Radiation Damage to Wire Chambers, Berkeley 1986, LBL 21170, p.213), operating with Ar/CO\({}_{2}\), showed no observable aging after 0.22 C/cm.
* The Mark III Collaboration (H. F.-W. Sadrozinski, same proceedings, p.121) varied systematically the CO\({}_{2}\) and the methane content between 1% and 10% in high-gain (10\({}^{7}\)) proportional counters. Their main result is that the chambers showed little aging up to 2 C/cm wire with less than 4% methane independently of the CO\({}_{2}\) content.
* In his own tests, John Kadyk (same proceedings, p.141) tested the mixtures Ar/CO\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 89/10/1 and 93/3/4 with 50 \(\upmu\)m gold-plated tungsten wires at a gain of 2x10\({}^{4}\). He found a gain loss due to aging of 15-40% per coulomb per cm wire, with less aging for higher gas flow. More recently he has obtained at the same gas gain for the first mixture a gain loss of 2% after 0.3 C/cm if used with a gold wire.
* Rainer Kotthaus (same proceedings, p.161) tested Ar/CO\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 90/9/1 for CELLO at PETRA and for VENUS at TRISTAN with 20 \(\upmu\)m wires. He had various plastics, rubber O-rings and silicone materials in the system and found aging-gain loss of a few percent per mC.
* H. Kado described the performance of the JADE Vertex Detector (same proceedings, p.207), which operates with Ar/CO\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 89.1/9.9/1.0 at 1.15 bar. They observed unusually high currents in their chamber after half a year of running which disappeared after the addition of 0.1% of water vapor to the gas mixture. A slightly different gas composition (Ar/CO\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 90/5/5) was reported to grow carbon filaments on the anode wires. They disappeared again after the return to the original gas mixture.
* Gary Godfrey from the Crystal Ball experiment at SLAC (same proceedings, p.257) reported a gain loss of <100%/C/cm wire in a test with Ar/CO\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 89/10/1 at a gain < 10\({}^{6}\) (accumulated charge 0.1 C/cm). They used that gas mixture for the experiment and had not observed any detector degradation at the time (0.05 C/cm collected).
* R. Bouclier et al. (NIM A 346 (1994) 114) recently tested Ar/CH\({}_{4}\) 90/10 in single-wire proportional counters and found an aging rate of about 40%/C/cm at a gas gain of 2x10\({}^{4}\), with 50 \(\upmu\)m Au/W wires and graphite cathodes.

A common feature of all examples for aging is the deposition of isolating films and/or 'whiskers' on the anode wires, often consisting of hydrocarbon polymers. Usually traces of gas impurities like silicon, sulfur etc. can be found in the deposits as well.

9. Ongoing Activities

The experimental activities towards the choice of the operating points for the MDTs can be divided in two main groups.

During the test beams of this summer we will study the resolution and efficiency of the gases which have shown promising results in the measurements and calculation so far. The most prominent gas for these tests is Ar/CO\({}_{2}\)/CH\({}_{4}\) 92/5/3. The prototypes with which these properties are tested will be single tubes with different wire diameters between 30 and 100 \(\upmu\)m and small bundles of up to 4x8 tubes. There is also a short prototype (\({}^{5}\) 4x4 tubes which will be tested in a dipole magnet, which delivers a field of up to 0.9 T.

Although the integrated charge of 0.13 C/cm in 10 years running at 100 Hz / cm\({}^{2}\) is well within the range in which a significant degradation of the performance through aging may easily be avoided, we have launched a major aging test programme consisting of several test stands.

First results come from Dubna (I.R. Boyko, G.A. Chelkov, M.A. Ignatenko, M. Yu. Nikolenko). MDT's, filled with an Ar / CO2 / iC4H10 mixture have been irradiated with electrons from \({}^{90}\)Sr and \({}^{204}\)Tl. No particular care has been taken to avoid pollution by construction materials. Pulse height degradation begins to be visible at about 1 C/cm. After irradiation, the pulse height decreases sensibly at rates above 500 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\). New, preliminary results with Ar(92%) / CO2(5%) / CH4(3%)indicate that, even without particular selection of construction materials, essentially no pulse height degradation happens up to 1 C/cm.

Another approach, trying to simulate as close as possible the \(\gamma\)-background at LHC, is followed at BNL. Drift tubes are irradiated by various \(\gamma\)-sources (\({}^{106}\)Ru, \({}^{60}\)Co and \({}^{207}\)Bi), yielding different spectra. At present, the average charge per hit deposited on the wire has been determined for these three sources. Especially, the influence of streamers at high gains has been studied. Another aim is to understand the role of space charge screening.

At Freiburg, several drift tubes are prepared to be exposed to the M2 muon beam at CERN. Particular attention is devoted to the cathode surface. Three options, blank aluminium, carbonized aluminium and MoS2 coated aluminium, will be compared.

A group at CERN is setting up a test stand which will serve for comparative studies, aimed at a better understanding of the influence of construction materials and operating conditions on the aging behaviour. The starting point will be a very clean, all-metallic system which will be the reference for all subsequent additions and modifications. At a later stage this setup will be used to study the different components which will be in contact with the gas in the final experiment, i.e. end plugs, O-rings etc.. In this way we want to rule out potentially dangerous materials. This setup is presently assembled and is expected to be operational beginning in July.

The milestone program of the ATLAS muon detector physics group foresees that a baseline operating point should be found until end of 1995. At that time the results from the test beams and first results from the aging test should be available.

10. Conclusions

A working point for the ATLAS MDT, which allows operation at the design luminosity, would result in 0.13\(C\)/\(cm\) integrated deposited charge over 10 years of LHC operation in the parts of the muon spectrometer with the most severe background conditions. However, our attitude to insist on a safety factor of 5 requires to design the chamber system to survive 0.67\(C\)/\(cm\). This value is considerably lower than similar requirements for other LHC detectors. Examples in literature show that such a radiation hardness can be achieved if the detector materials and the gas system are carefully chosen. This should be possible due to the simplicity of the basic MDT detection cell.

informations are to be studied during the testbeams in summer 1995. As no new information since the Technical Proposal about these topics is available we will neglect them in this note.

The present experimental gas studies concentrate on the dependence of the streamer rate on the gas gain under various conditions. The present (preliminary) results are given in tab. 2.

These measurements are still in progress and the final results may differ by a calibration factor of up to 2. However, they indicate that it is possible to find a gas with considerably less than 1% streamer at a proportional gas gain of \(2\times 10^{4}\) and they allow to make comparative conclusions.

Table 2: Gas gain at 1% streamer rate. AP denotes gases with afterpulsingthe measurements show that the achievable proportional gas gain before the onset of the streamer region is higher for

* smaller wire diameter;
* smaller fraction of quencher in the gas mixture;
* smaller pressure.

The MDT chamber gas based on these measurements would consist, apart from its main component argon, of a few percent of hydrocarbon quencher. Only hydrocarbon quenchers offer sufficient quenching power to suppress afterpulsing from photoelectrons emitted from the cathode. This task can be fulfilled by 3% Methane or 0.5% Ethane. Methane is the preferred solution due to the potential danger of pollution of commercially available Ethane. The smaller amount of Ethane needed to suppress the afterpulsing would probably have to be increased for practical reasons in a closed gas system, as presently planned for the MDT gas system, as the purification will make it difficult to keep the gas mixture stable to such a value.

The percentages of hydrocarbon quenchers given above are small enough to keep the gas mixture non-flammable.1

Footnote 1: The level of flammability is for Ar/C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) mixtures at 3% and for Ar/CH\({}_{4}\) mixtures at 6%.

Although we intend to keep the number of components in the gas mixture small, other additives to the MDT chamber gas, like small percentages of CO\({}_{2}\) or nitrogen might be desireable to facilitate the calibration. The former gas decreases the Lorentz angle of the gas mixture, whereas the latter makes the r-t relation of some gas mixtures more linear. This would make the r-t relation more stable against changes of the operating conditions (like pressure, temperature or high voltage). However, the measurements show, that nitrogen increases the probability for streamers. On the other hand, promising gas mixtures exist, for which the linearity does not rely on this additive (see section 5).

For the case that aging of the MDTs with a gas mixture containing hydrocarbon quenchers turns out to be critical, we are also studying gas mixtures where these additives are replaced by \(\mathrm{CF_{4}}\). However, we would like to avoid this component as it is not a sufficiently strong quencher to suppress afterpulsing and might cause problems due to gas gain instabilities. A strong dependence of the drift velocity on the amount of \(\mathrm{CF_{4}}\) in the gas mixture as well as the high price of this gas makes its use in the ATLAS MDTs less attractive.

## 7 Background-induced streamer rate

The streamer probability is not necessarily the same for all incoming particles. In fact, it is expected to depend on the ionization density which may be significantly higher for photons and neutrons than for minimum ionizing particles. A first systematic study has been performed at BNL, using drift tubes filled with \(\mathrm{Ar(90\%)}/\mathrm{C_{2}H_{6}(5\%)}/\mathrm{N_{2}(5\%)}\) and three \(\mathrm{\beta}\) and \(\mathrm{\gamma}\) sources with different energy spectra (\({}^{106}\mathrm{Ru}\),\({}^{60}\mathrm{Co}\) and \({}^{207}\mathrm{Bi}\)) which give rise to different charge densities. Although a clear source dependence is seen, the streamer rate is always lower than 0.1% up to a gain of \(5\cdot 10^{4}\). These studies will be pursued.

## 8 Drift properties

To get first indications of the drift properties of these gas mixtures we used calculations with the simulation programs MAGBOLTZ[4] and GARFIELD[5].

One of the most promising gas mixtures for the MDTs is \(\mathrm{Ar/CO_{2}/CH_{4}}\) 92/5/3. Its drift parameters and r-t relation are shown in fig. 3a. This gas is one of the cases where addition of nitrogen does not change the r-t relation (fig. 3b). Instead, reducing the amount of \(\mathrm{CO_{2}}\) to 3% improves the linearity of the r-t relation at the expense of an increased Lorentz angle and diffusion (fig. 3c).

Similar calculations were performed for gases containing ethane as the quencher. The dependence of the r-t relations on changes in several operating parameters is summarized in tab. 3. For a comparison we also include the gases which were presented in the Technical Proposal.
