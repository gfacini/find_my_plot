## 1 Introduction

Test beam measurements have played a central role during the development of the ATLAS detector concept and design. The results and experience gained in test beams from a broad spectrum of detector R&D projects have often been a decisive element in the choice between different options for detector components. Basic R&D work is still needed in areas related to the electronics and readout systems. However, since 1994 there is a clear evolution of the test beams activities towards ATLAS prototyping, calorimeter calibration and performance tests combining the different subdetectors as well as integration of the overall trigger and DAQ systems. These combined tests require permanent large installations in the control rooms and on the beam lines, especially the H8 beam line, where they include cryogenics for the liquid argon calorimetry, magnets for the inner detector systems, enlargement of the experimental zones to accommodate future set-ups for hadron calorimetry and muon detection.

The main emphasis of the test beam requests for the short-, medium-, and long-term future ( 1996 to about 2001 ) will be on prototype, large-system performance tests, as well as on quality control, calibration and performance checksof detector components during serial production.

During the last few years the ATLAS collaboration has built up substantial installations in the SPS H8 and H6 lines, including cryogenics services, magnets, as well as a parasitic muon test facility in the SPS M2 beam halo. ATLAS would like to maintain these facilities and to develop further the infrastructure and set-ups in the H8 and H6 beams, in view of the large amount of calorimeter modules to be calibrated as well as of common tests involving all major subdetectors, trigger and DAQ systems.

Considering the nearby location of the H8 and H6 beams, which will be very useful for the future sharing of common control room infrastructure and cryogenics facilities, the ATLAS experiment would request the full use of the H8 beam line as well as the major use of the H6 beam line during the future SPS proton periods. The parasitic test facility in the SPS M2 beam halo should also be available to ATLAS for muon detectors tests and quality control. In this preferred scenario, ATLAS would not request to maintain the X5/X7 beam lines in the West area in order to free hall space for LHC detector construction. However, if these beam lines should be kept operational in the future and upgraded to a maximum beam energy of 200-260 GeV, ATLAS would reconsider its future plans, as it would represent some advantages for ATLAS to be able to use part of the X5 or X7 beams and associated areas, following an alternative scenario to be studied. In this case, some subdetector tests could be moved from the H6 beam line to these new facilities.

Some fraction of beam time is also requested at the PS beam lines for low energy calibration of the calorimeters, as well as for some tests of the tracking system.

## 2 H8 Beam Line

The present installation in the H8 beam line comprises high-precision tracking elements in the form of a silicon microstrip beam telescope and pixel detectors, followed by a TRT prototype in a 0.7 T magnetic field provided by a small solenoid (used by the former RD6), a LAr set-up (used by the former RD3), a set-up for the hadronic tile calorimeter prototypes (used by the former RD34) and muon instrumentation prototypes. The tracking and calorimeter systems, together with electronics, trigger and DAQ pre-prototype systems, have taken data in a first combined run in September 1994. The plan is to develop this set-up into a section of the ATLAS detector with a geometry as realistic as possible, and to complete it with a superconducting 1.8T magnet for the inner detector as well as with a complete muon chamber set-up. It is foreseen to make detailed calibration of the combined electromagnetic (e.m) and hadronic calorimetry as well as performance tests of a complete azimuthal section of the ATLAS barrel part. This will require a new dedicated cryostat for the full size e.m. LAr barrel calorimeter modules, a large magnetic field volume for the barrel sector prototype (BSP) of the inner detector, new support structures for the LAr cryostat and hadronic tile calorimeter, and to complete the muon installation. For the BSP, the existing magnet present in the H8 beam line in the zone H8A is presently under recommissionning.

In the H8 beam line, the organisation of the zones should allow for stand-alone tests and calibrations of the different subdetectors in addition to the common ATLAS tests. In order to keep the total beam time request to a reasonable level, sharing of the beam by the various detectors has to be scheduled, especially among the different parts of the tracking system. As the e.m. barrel and hadronic tile calorimeters are heavy users of the H8 beam time, for precise calibration and quality control of the modules during their production phase, the best scenario for stand-alone tests is to alternate them on the beam line and garage positions on a push-pull mode, with a beam dump in between isolating their respective zones. The muon detectors, sitting at the extreme end of the beam line, will profit extensively from parasitic running.

With such a scenario, and testing only one sixth of the production of the e.m. barrel calorimeter modules, the H8 beam time request from ATLAS, in terms of main user of the beam line, amounts to the following values per year of proton period :

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Period & Beam time request \\ \hline
1996 - 1997 & 25 weeks / year \\ \hline
1998 - 2000 & 30 weeks / year \\ \hline
2001 & 25 weeks / year \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The details of the different detector beam time requests as a function of the coming years are listed in Table 1.

It has to be noted that the 1995 test beam time request from ATLAS for the H8 beam already covered the full available SPS proton period, and all subdetector test requests for this beam had to be shortened. For the 1996 proton beam time period the situation is similar and already extensive sharing of the H8 line by the subdetectors had to be scheduled, shortening considerably the initial requests from the subdetectors, in order to fit in the available period. The Collaboration therefore requests that the H8 beam line be fully attributed with priority to ATLAS until the completion of the detector.

## 3 H6 Beam Line

In the H6 beam line, ATLAS is using the LAr cryostat and cryogenics installation of the H1 collaboration (used by the former RD33). Various stand-alone tracking detector and calorimeter tests, such as tests of the Forward Calorimeter (FCAL),have been performed in this beam. The intention is to use the H6 beam also in the future and to develop further its infrastructure in terms of cryostats and cryogenic facilities. In particular we would like to complement it in the future with the adding of an existing cryostat (used by NA31) for stand-alone tests of the e.m. endcap calorimeter modules. Common tests of the LAr endcap detectors, electromagnetic, hadronic as well as FCAL, will benefit from the existing H1 set-up. Given the limited size of the H1 cryostat, special electromagnetic and hadronic modules will have to be constructed in order to be able to perform the necessary common tests. In the preferred scenario, all endcap calorimeter tests will be concentrated in the H6 beam line. The major use of this line by ATLAS is considered necessary as the H8 beam line is already fully dedicated to the ATLAS barrel combined and stand-alone tests. However, some limited time-sharing with other users might remain possible in the H6 beam line.

The scheduling of the H6 beam time is in complete interdependance with that of the H8 line, as the energies of these two beams are coupled. For TRT tests as well as for low energy calibration of the calorimeters we foresee to run the energy of the H8 beam at 20 GeV for a few weeks per year (around four weeks). In this configuration no high energy beam can be delivered in H6. This mode of operation, having the energies of the two beams coupled, represents a limitation that ATLAS is prepared to face, providing that priority be given to ATLAS in the scheduling of the low energy settings in the H8 beam line over the scheduling of H6, in the case where external users to ATLAS would be present in the H6 line.

With all common and stand-alone tests of the endcap calorimeters located in the H6 line, the ATLAS request amounts to the following values per year of proton period :

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|} \hline Period & Beam time request \\ \hline
1996 & 7 weeks/year \\ \hline
1997 & 11 weeks/year \\ \hline
1998 - 2000 & 20 weeks/year \\ \hline
2001 & 8 weeks/year \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The details of the beam time requests are listed in Table 2, for the e.m. calorimeter (EMEC), the hadronic calorimeter (HEC) and the forward calorimeter (FCAL) as well as for the envisaged common tests and inter-calibrations.

The Collaboration therefore requests that the major part of the H6 beam time be attributed with priority to ATLAS until the completion of the detector.

## 4 PS Beams

PS beams will occasionally be required for smaller stand-alone component tests of the tracking system. A low energy calibration of the calorimeters, of major importance to understand the jet response, should equally be foreseen and the Collaboration is studying scenarios to investigate this possibility. This may involve the installation of a large set-up in the PS beam line, in the year 1999 or later.

## 5 M2 Beam Line

The parasitic test facility in the M2 muon beam halo has been very valuable in the past for muon chamber tests. The Collaboration requests to be able to continue its use at the level of 8 weeks/year and therefore recommends that this beam remain operational in the future for such a purpose.

## 6 X5/X7 Beam Lines

In order to optimize the use of the existing hall space in the halls 180/190/191 for LHC detector construction, in particular for ATLAS construction in terms of toroids and LAr detectors assemblies, the Collaboration does not request that the X5/X7 beam lines be maintained operational. As a result, all endcap detectors have to be tested in the H6 beam line as mentioned earlier. ATLAS is willing to bear the consequence that in this case some specific test modules for the combined calorimetry test will have to be assembled due to the limited volume of the existing H1 cryostat.

If CERN would nevertheless decide to keep these two beam lines operational in the future, ATLAS would reconsider its current scenario, as it would represent some advantages to be able to use part of the X5 or X7 beams and associated areas, on the condition that the energies of these beams be upgraded to 200 GeV or even preferably to 260 GeV. By using the present large RD3 cryostat, after some modifications of the platform, the construction of the required special e.m. and hadronic modules would be avoided. With its size, the RD3 cryostat would fit in height in the X5 beam line but cannot, for this reason, be installed in the H6 beam line.

Also in this case, given the fact that endcap calorimeters and cryostat will be assembled in the halls 180/190/191, namely in a very nearby area of the X7A experimental zone, ATLAS would reserve the possibility to set up one of the two final endcap cryostats in the beam in order to study the performances of the overall endcap detectors.

## 7 Summary

The Collaboration requests the full use of the H8 beam line at a maximum level of 30 weeks/year of proton period and the major use of the H6 beam line at a maximum level of 20 weeks/year.

The parasitic test facility in the M2 muon beam halo should be maintained operational in the future years. ATLAS requests to be able to use this facility at a level of 8 weeks/year.

Some weeks/year will occasionally be required at the PS beams for tracking tests and low energy calibration of the calorimeters.

The Collaboration does not request that the X5/X7 beam lines be maintained operational, preferring that this space be used for ATLAS assembly of the toroids and LAr calorimeters and cryostats. However, in the event where these beam lines should be conserved and upgraded in energy for other users, it would represent some advantages for ATLAS to shift part of the H6 activities to these beams.
