## 1 Introduction

The implementation of an effective muon trigger is a crucial item for any p-p detector at LHC/SSC colliders. The lepton identification is in fact the basic signature for the Higgs discovery and many other interesting physics processes and therefore the trigger should select in the fastest and clearest way events containing leptons.

Muons, being penetrating particles, can be searched for after many interactions lenghts of material that will almost completely remove the confusion due to the large number of hadrons emerging from the p-p collisions present in each bunch crossing.

Simple detectors with limited space resolution will be adequate to identify the few penetrating tracks emerging from the inner calorimeter and to perform at the same time a fast evaluation of their momentum.

In this note we present the results of a preliminary study for a muon trigger scheme to be implemented in an iron toroid spectrometer for LHC.

The conceptual design of such a spectrometer has been already presented in the Aachen LHC workshop [1].

## 2 The trigger schemes

Two different trigger schemes can be foreseen according to the possible detector configurations in the spectrometer.

In the first scheme three layers of detector, one just before the toroid, one inside the iron and one outside, surround the central part of the apparatus. In the barrel region the whole circumference is subdivided in 8 sectors. Each sector is covered by a system of chambers with strip orientation perpendicular to the beam direction.

The forward detector are again subdivided in 8 sectors with the strips of circular shape centred on the beam position.

This trigger scheme, for barrel and forward regions, is shown in fig. 1 and has been proposed in the Aachen LHC workshop [2]. When the strip I on the plane 1 is hit then a cone of width A1 centred in the strip O1 of the plane 2 is opened. The centre (O) is the intersection between the plane 2 of the straight line passing for the nominal position of the vertex and the middle of the strip I (plane 1). The width A1 determines the momentum cut.

If the fired strip J of the plane 2 is inside the cone A1 then a second cone from plane 2 to plane 3 is opened. The centre of that cone of width A2 is the intersection on the plane 3 -of the straight line from the nominal position of the vertex to the middle of the strip J. Again the width of the second cone determines the momentum cut.

In the second scheme only two outer layers are used both in the barrel and in the end caps (see fig. 2); the momentum evaluation is performed by looking at the exit angle of the track. With the respect to the previous scheme the advantage of this algorithm is that is simpler from the point of view of the implementation and does not require muon-chunders placed inside the iron toroid.

A hit on the plane I opens a cone of width A1 and hits are searched for on layer 2. No other cones are involved.

The values of the cone sizes definig the momentum cut-off for both schemes have been chosen on the basis of a detailed Monte Carlo simulation (see next section) by requiring a trigger efficiency at \(p_{t}^{th}=p_{T}^{th}\geq 95\%\) (\(p_{t}^{th}\) is the transverse momentum there should given by the trigger).

## 3 The Monte Carlo simulation

Only a very preliminary description of one sector of the apparatus has been used at this stage. No detector response effect has been simulated at this stage.

The layout used in this study of the first trigger scheme is shown in fig.3. After the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter there are 3 layers of magnetised iron starting at \(r>4.8\ m\), 80 cm thick, spaced of 20 cm to allow for the chamber installation. cm thick, spaced of 20 cm. to allow the chamber installation. A muon, crossing the detector at \(\eta=0\), will traverse 293 radiation lenghts (23 in the e.m. calorimeter, 88 in the hadron calorimeter and the remaining 182 in the iron toroid) i.e. 30 interaction lenghts (0.9 in the e.m. calorimeter, 9.9 in the hadron calorimeter and 19 in the iron toroid); in the forward region the muon will cross 371 radiation lenghts i.e. 38 interaction lenghts.

The muon chambers are organised in three planes: the first just behind the first iron block (after the hadronic calorimeter), the second in the middle of the toroid and the third just beyond the last iron block; the coverage is limited to \(\eta_{max}=2\). These chambers are planes segmented with 3 \(cm\) strips.

Concerning the second trigger scheme (two outer trigger planes only, see fig.4) a different detector layout has been adopted, following the evolution of one the EAGLE detector option [3].

The main differences, with the respect to the previous detector, are:

* the inner tracking space is magnetised with a solenoid of 1.5 \(T\) field (190 \(cm\) radius);
* in the barrel there is a return yoke for the solenoid magnet, surrounding the hadron calorimeter, 40 \(cm\) thick and unif-tmlly magnetised. In the end caps no magnetic field has been placed;
* the iron toroid is realized with two blocks of magnetised iron 100 \(cm\) thick (130 \(cm\) in the end caps);* the trigger chambers are placed in two planes outside the toroid with a separation of 100 \(cm\)

The iron toroids are magnetized with an uniform field of 1.8 \(T\) (iron saturation). Stray-field effects have not been taken into account.

The muons originate at the centre of the detector within a gaussian distribution along the beam direction; a conservative value of \(\sigma=8\)\(cm\) has been used in the simulation and fluctuations within \(\pm 2\sigma\) are allowed. The muon have been traced with the GEANT Monte Carlo [4]; energy losses with Landau fluctuations and multiple conolombian scattering are fully simulated; secondary particles originating from the interaction of the muons with the matter are not traced at all.

For each \(p_{T}\) about 50K muons of both charges at 5 different \(\eta\) values (0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0) have been traced up to the outermost layer of chambers in order to estimate the cone sizes. The results for the two schemes for the two schemes for \(p_{T}^{th.}=~{}20\) and 40 \(GeV/c\) are summarized in fig. 5 and 6. The con widths increase from a minimal value at \(\eta=0\) to a maximum at the edge of the barrel region and then decrease again up to the maximum \(\eta\) detectable in the forward region.

## 4 Trigger efficiencies and rates; trigger rates for \(H\to\mu\mu\mu\)

In order to evaluate the performances in terms of trigger efficiency of the proposed schemes, muons with \(p_{T}\) ranging from a minimal value (about 7 \(GeV/e\)) up to 100 \(GeV/e\) at each \(\eta\) have been simulated in the apparatus and in the proposed trigger algorithm has been applied to the hit pattern observed in the chambers. Fig. 7 ad 8 show the efficiency as a function of the muon \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) for two differents values of the threshold and for the two proposed triggers. No relevant differences are observed comparing the rejection power of the two schemes apart a degradation at \(\eta=2\) for the second one. However, in order to have a clear idea about the rejection power of these trigger schemes we have to check that the trigger efficiency for low \(p_{T}\) muons decreases with \(p_{T}\) more rapidly than the increase of the muon production cross section. This has to be shown for two main sources of muons:

1. muons coming from charged meson decays in central detector [2][5];
2. prompt muons, mainly from heavy flavour decays [6].

So far, only processes in 2. have been considered. In fig.9 is shown the effect of the trigger on muons from beauty and charm hadron decays that are the main process of single prompt muon production at LIC [6]. The trigger rates given with these algorithms are compared in Table 1 with those given by an ideal sharp cut at \(p_{T}=20\) in the case of a single muon trigger and a dimuon trigger; the same study has been repeated in the case of the first trigger scheme for \(p_{T}^{th.}=40\)\(GeV/e\); results are in fig. 10 and Table 2.

Figure 11 shows the trigger acceptance for the process \(H\to Z\)\(Z\to\mu\mu\mu\) when a single muon trigger or a dimuon trigger is applied (\(p_{T}^{th.}=20\) GeV/\(c\)). The case of triggering events \(H\to Z\)\(Z\to\mu\mu ee\) with muons is also reported in figure 11. These results are in good

agreement with what we has been found in a previous study [6]. It is possible to see that a dimuon trigger with \(p_{T}^{th}=20\)\(GeV/c\) seems to be a promising way to trigger efficiently heavy Higgs decays to 4 leptons.

## 5 Conclusions

We have perfoned a preliminary analysis of the two possible schemes for a toroidal muon spectrometer at LHC energies, both in the barrel and in the forward region up to \(\eta=2\), using low granularity detectors.

The results indicate that such schemes should provide a good rejection power against the main low energy muon processes, still keeping a high efficiency for the crucial processes like \(H\to\mu\mu ll\)

Acceptable trigger rates are expected with a dimuon trigger with \(p_{T}^{th}\ =\ 20\)\(GeV/e\).

More detailed studies that should provide a realistic muon proposal for the EAGLE detector are in progress.
