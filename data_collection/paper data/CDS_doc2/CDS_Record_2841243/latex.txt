## Overview

This is a collection of plots comparing Monte Carlo simulation of \(t\bar{t}\) events by the ATLAS and CMS experiments using Powheg+Pythia8 and using Sherpa. Common settings are defined for the Powheg-Box-v2 implementation of the HVQ process [1, 2, 3] with Pythia 8 [4] using the respective ATLAS [5, 6] and CMS [7, 8] experimental tunes. Common settings are also defined for Sherpa [9] v2.2.11. Each experiment is able to produce Monte Carlo samples using the agreed upon "Common" simulation settings for both Powheg+Pythia8 and Sherpa within their own software framework, and the distributions produced by the two frameworks agree with each other. The plots shown here focus on comparing distributions for these settings to the nominal Powheg+Pythia8 \(t\bar{t}\) samples used by each experiment. The nominal ATLAS setup also includes decaying of heavy flavour hadrons with EvtGen [10, 11] (version 1.6.0), which is not used in the nominal CMS setup.

In comparison to version 0.1 of the Common MC settings for Powheg+Pythia8 [12], the settings for version 2 have been adjusted to give reasonable agreement with data and with the default Powheg+Pythia8 samples used by both collaborations. This is the first time Sherpa has been implemented in the CMS software, while it has been used previously by ATLAS [13, 14, 15]. The four predictions are compared to unfolded ATLAS and CMS data in dilepton and lepton+jets \(t\bar{t}\) final states using Rivet [16].

An overview of the relevant Powheg+Pythia8 settings is given in Table 1. The common Sherpa settings are summarised in Table 2.

Figure 2: Comparison of common Powheg+Pythia8 settings to the nominal ATLAS and CMS Powheg+Pythia8 settings as well as to Sherpa 2.2.11 for the mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system in the lepton+jets boosted channel. The data are taken from the ATLAS lepton+jets boosted analysis [18], and the same event selection and reconstruction is applied to each of the Monte Carlo predictions. The yellow band in the ratio panel shows the statistical+systematic uncertainty on the data.

Figure 3: Comparison of common Powheg+Pythia8 settings to the nominal ATLAS and CMS Powheg+Pythia8 settings as well as to Sherpa 2.2.11 for (a) the scalar of jet transverse momenta \(H_{T}\), and (b) the jet multiplicity \(N_{\rm jets}\) in the lepton+jets resolved channel. The data are taken from the CMS lepton+jets analysis [19], and the same event selection and reconstruction is applied to each of the Monte Carlo predictions. The yellow band in the ratio panel shows the statistical+systematic uncertainty on the data.

The data are taken from the CMS lepton+jets analysis [20], and the same event selection and reconstruction is applied to each of the Monte Carlo predictions. The yellow band in the ratio panel shows the statistical+systematic uncertainty on the data.

Figure 5: Comparison of common Powheg+Pythia8 settings to the nominal ATLAS and CMS Powheg+Pythia8 settings as well as to Sherpa 2.2.11 for the \(\Delta\phi\) angle between the two leptons in the dilepton channel.
