Introduction

The underlying event (UE) is defined as the activity accompanying any hard scattering in a collision event. This includes partons not participating in a hard-scattering process (beam remnants), and additional scatters in the same proton-proton collision, termed multiple parton interactions (MPI). Initial and final state gluon radiation (ISR, FSR) also contribute to the UE activity. It is impossible to unambiguously separate the UE from the hard scattering process on an event-by-event basis. However, distributions have been measured that are sensitive to the properties of the UE. The ATLAS [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], CMS [6, 7, 8] and ALICE [9] experiments at the LHC have performed many measurements of the observables sensitive to the UE in Run 1. These measurements have helped to constrain the MPI models of Monte Carlo (MC) event generators. This note presents the first look at such observables in Run 2, at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, for detector level reconstructed quantities.

The direction of the leading track is used to define regions in the azimuthal plane1 that have different sensitivity to the UE, a concept first used in [10]. As illustrated in Figure 1, the azimuthal angular difference between tracks and the leading track \(|\Delta\phi|=|\phi-\phi_{\rm{leadtrack}}|\), is used to define the following three azimuthal UE regions:

Footnote 1: The ATLAS reference system is a Cartesian right-handed coordinate system, with the nominal collision point at the origin. The anti-clockwise beam direction defines the positive \(z\)-axis, while the positive \(x\)-axis is defined as pointing from the collision point to the center of the LHC ring and the positive \(y\)-axis points upwards. The azimuthal angle \(\phi\) is measured around the beam axis, and the polar angle \(\theta\) is measured with respect to the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is given by \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). Transverse momentum is defined relative to the beam axis.

* \(|\Delta\phi|<60^{\circ}\), the _toward_ region,
* \(60^{\circ}<|\Delta\phi|<120^{\circ}\), the _transverse_ region, and
* \(|\Delta\phi|>120^{\circ}\), the _away_ region.

The transverse region is sensitive to the underlying event, since it is by construction perpendicular to the direction of the hard scatter and hence it is expected to have a lower level of activity from the hard scattering process compared to the away region. The observables measured in this analysis are shown in Table 1.

The transverse, toward and away regions each have an area of \(\Delta\phi\,\Delta\eta=10\,\pi/3\) in \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) space. The average density of particles, \(\langle{\rm d}^{2}N_{\rm ch}/{\rm d}\eta\,{\rm d}\phi\rangle\), and average transverse momentum sum density, \(\langle{\rm d}^{2}\sum p_{\rm T}/{\rm d}\eta\,{\rm d}\phi\rangle\), are constructed by dividing the mean values by the corresponding area. The leading track is included in the toward region distributions, unless otherwise stated.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} \hline \hline Observable & Definition \\ \hline \(\langle{\rm d}^{2}N_{\rm ch}/{\rm d}\eta\,{\rm d}\phi\rangle\) & Number of tracks per unit \(\eta\)–\(\phi\) \\ \(\langle{\rm d}^{2}\sum p_{\rm T}/{\rm d}\eta\,{\rm d}\phi\rangle\) & Scalar sum of track \(p_{\rm T}\) per unit \\  & \(\eta\)–\(\phi\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 2 Event and object selection

The ATLAS detector covers almost the whole solid angle around the collision point with layers of tracking detectors, calorimeters and muon chambers. It is described in detail elsewhere [11]. For the measurements presented in this paper, the tracking devices and the trigger system are of particular importance. The innermost pixel layer, the insertable B-layer (IBL) [12, 13], was added between Run 1 and Run 2 of the LHC, around a new thinner (radius of 25 mm) beam pipe. It is composed of 14 azimuthal lightweight staves, each of them made of 12 silicon planar sensors in its central region and \(2\times 4\) 3D sensors at the ends. The pixel sizes are smaller than for the other pixel layers giving better longitudinal impact parameter resolution. The smaller radius gives rise to better transverse impact parameter resolution. Furthermore new service quarter panels have been implemented which significantly reduce the material at the boundaries of the active tracking volume.

This analysis uses the same dataset and follows the ATLAS charged particle distribution analysis [14] regarding event and track selections. Events were collected from colliding proton bunches where the Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators recorded one or more counters above threshold on either side of the detector.

The data sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 170 \(\mu\)b\({}^{-1}\). The only additional requirement for this analysis was the presence of a leading track with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of at least 1. This requirement results in a fully efficient trigger, hence no trigger requirement is imposed in MC events.

To reduce the contribution from background events and additional interactions, events are required to contain a primary vertex [15] and no second vertex with four or more tracks. The rate of background events from non-colliding beams is estimated to be less than 0.01% and the contribution from tracks from additional interactions is less than 0.01% after this requirement.

Figure 1: Definition of UE regions as a function of the azimuthal angle with respect to the leading trackThe tracks are selected by requiring:

* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\),
* at least 1 pixel hit with the additional requirement of an innermost pixel detector hit if expected (if not expected then next to innermost hit is required, if expected2), Footnote 2: A hit is expected if the track crosses an active region of a pixel module that has not been disabled.
* at least 6 SCT (semiconductor tracker) hits,
* absolute value of the the transverse impact parameter, \(d_{0}^{\mathrm{BL}}\), calculated with respect to the average beam position to be less than 1.5 mm,
* absolute value of the difference between the (longitudinal) position of the track along the beam line at the point where \(d_{0}^{\mathrm{BL}}\) is measured and the longitudinal position of the primary vertex, \(z_{0}\cdot\sin\theta\) to be less than 1.5 mm, and
* for tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\) GeV, the track \(\chi^{2}\) probability has to be bigger than 0.01 to suppress mis-measured tracks.

## 3 Monte Carlo Models

The data are compared with the Monte Carlo event generator predictions shown in Table 2, after passing the generated events through the ATLAS detector simulation [16], which is based on Geant4 [17].

## 4 Results

The results are presented at detector level, without any corrections (except in MC, the width of the vertex distribution along the \(z\) axis is reweighted to match the data). The uncertainty resulting from tracking inefficiency is estimated by randomly dropping tracks according to the tracking efficiency uncertainty determined as a function of track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\). The tracking efficiency uncertainty is about 2% or

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline \hline Generator & Version & Tune & PDF & Focus \\ \hline Pythia8[18] & 8.186 & A2 [19] & MSTW2008LO[20] & MB \\ Pythia8 & 8.186 & Monash [21] & NNPDF2.3LO[22] & MB/UE \\ Pythia8 & 8.186 & A14 [23] & NNPDF2.3LO & UE/Shower \\ Herwig++[24] & 2.7.1 & UEEE5[25] & CTEQ6L1[26] & UE \\ Epos[27] & 3.1 & LHC[28] & & MB \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Details of the MC models used. It is emphasized that the tunes use data from different experiments to constrain different processes, but for brevity only the _data_ which had the most weight in each specific tune are shown. Some tunes are focused on describing the minimum-bias (MB) distributions better, while the rest are tuned to describe the underlying event (UE) distributions, as indicated. Except for A2 and A14, the tunes were performed by the MC developersless over the majority of the distributions shown in this note. This tracking efficiency uncertainty distribution is also taken from the corresponding charged particle distribution analysis [14]. No correction for secondary tracks is performed.

The average track density and average scalar sum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) density of tracks are plotted as a function of \(|\Delta\phi|\) in Figure 2. They are expected to show a gradual transition from more inclusive minimum-bias type events to events with an identified hard scatter. MB tunes like Pythia8 A2 and Epos do better for the lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead}}\) slice, while UE tunes like A14, Monash and Herwig++ UEEE5 do better for the higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead}}\) slice. In general however these distributions do not show a significant difference in shape between data and MC predictions as seen in an early Run 1 analysis, Ref. [1].

In Figure 3, the average densities of track multiplicity and scalar sum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are shown. In the transverse region, both show a gradual increase, rising to an approximately constant "plateau" for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead}}>6\) GeV. For higher values of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead}}\), the toward and away regions include contributions from jet-like activity, yielding gradually rising average sum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) density. Among the MC models, Pythia8 A14, Monash and Herwig++ UEEE5 predictions are closest to data in the plateau part of the transverse region, but none of the models describe the initial rise well. The Epos generator predicts significantly less activity at higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead}}\), indicating the absence of semi-hard minimum bias events. Compared to 7 TeV results, these represent roughly around a 20% increase to the UE activity.

The leading track is defined to be at \(\Delta\phi=0\), and excluded from the distributions. The distributions obtained by restricting \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead}}\) to different values are shown separately. The bottom panels in each plot show the ratio of MC predictions to data. The shaded bands represent the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties, while the error bars show the statistical uncertainties.

The bottom panels in each plot show the ratio of MC predictions to data. The shaded bands represent the combined statistical and systematic uncertainties, while the error bars show the statistical uncertainties.

Conclusion

A first look at observables sensitive to UE at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV are presented. These detector level distributions show discriminating power between different MC models. However, none of the models are very discrepant from data, building confidence in MPI energy extrapolation model used in these generators.
