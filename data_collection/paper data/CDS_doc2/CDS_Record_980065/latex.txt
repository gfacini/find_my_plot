###### Abstract

SU4 low mass SUSY model was studied at ATLAS with full Geant4 simulation. With a production cross section of 270 pb and masses in the range 60 - 450 GeV, SU4 seems to be a promising target for SUSY searches with early ATLAS data. Multijet events with \(E_{t}^{miss}\) and \(b\) jets were analysed for the inclusive searches and the light stop search from the decay \(\tilde{g}\to\tilde{t}_{1}t\to tb\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) where the final state _tb_ invariant mass distribution was reconstructed with a kinematic endpoint close to the expected position. Pure hadronic events with \(E_{t}^{miss}\) and no \(b\) jets were analysed for the right squark search from the \(\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{q}_{R}\) events where the distribution of Cambridge \(\mathrm{m}_{T2}\) variable was reconstructed with a kinematic endpoint consistent to the SU4 right squark mass value. With only 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data, Standard Model backgrounds can be suppressed to the S/B level of about 3 in the inclusive searches, higher than 4 in the light stop search and above 1 in the right squark search.

## 1 Introduction

Supersymmetry is one of the most promising extensions of the Standard Model. The Minimal Supersymmetric Model has a large number of free parameters which can be significantly reduced by assuming a particular Supersymmetry breaking mechanism. In the framework of mSUGRA Supersymmetry breaking paradigm the masses, mixings, and decays of all SUSY and Higgs particles are determined in terms of five parameters: the common scalar mass \(m_{0}\), the common fermion mass \(m_{1/2}\) and the common trilinear coupling \(A_{0}\) at the grand unification energy scale, together with the ratio \(\tan\beta\) between the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets and the sign of the Higgsino mass parameter \(\mu\). Different regions of mSUGRA five dimensional parameter space have been proposed as SUSY benchmarks [1], [2], [3] and studied at ATLAS in order to optimise search sensitivity and measurement precision.

This paper presents full Geant4 simulation analysis of the SU4 low mass SUSY model which has been chosen [4] to be close to the limit of the Tevatron Run II reach. SU4 model is defined in the mSUGRA framework by the parameters:

\(m_{0}=200\) GeV, \(m_{1/2}=160\) GeV, \(A_{0}=\) - 400 GeV, \(\tan\beta=10\), \(\mu\ >0\).

In the SU4 scenario all masses are in the range 60 - 450 GeV. The phenomenology of the low mass SUSY model is described in Section 2.

Standard Model backgrounds originate from the \(t\bar{t}\), \(W+jets\), \(Z+jets\) and \(multijet\) processes. ATLAS DC2/Rome production datasets used for SU4 signal and SM backgrounds are listed in Section 3.

Inclusive searches are sensitive to \(\bar{g}\) decays to 3rd generation squarks which represent the majority of SU4 events. Having high production cross section of 270 pb, inclusive SU4 signal could be observed above the Standard Model background processes at integrated luminosity of only 200 pb\({}^{-1}\), what is shown in Section 4.

Due to R parity conservation in mSUGRA models every SUSY event has two lightest SUSY particles which are massive and stable but undetectable, thus causing SUSY decay chains to be incomplete and not adequate for mass measurements. Exclusive supersymmetric signals may be extracted from the kinematic limits of various variables. This technique was applied on \(\bar{g}\to\bar{t}_{1}t\to tb\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) decay where the final state _tb_ invariant mass distribution was reconstructed, presented in Section 5 and on \(\bar{q}_{R}\bar{q}_{R}\) events where the distribution of Cambridge m\({}_{T2}\) variable [13] was reconstructed, presented in Section 6.

## 2 Phenomenology

SU4 Monte Carlo events were produced with Herwig - Jimmy generator [5]. Production cross section is given in Table 1. Events representing more than 1% of the SU4 production are listed in Table 1.

SU4 masses and decays were obtained by ISASUGRA 7.71 [6] where top mass of 175 GeV was used. SU4 mass spectrum is presented in Table 2. All SU4 masses are within the range limited by the mass of the lightest SUSY particle which is the first neutralino,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c c c c c c|} \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Production cross section is 270 pb.} \\ \hline event & \(\sigma\) (pb) & (\%) & event & \(\sigma\) (pb) & (\%) \\ \hline \(\bar{g}\bar{g}\) & 56 & 21 & \(\bar{q}_{L}\bar{q}_{L}\) & 13 & 5 \\ \(\bar{g}\bar{q}_{L}\) & 53 & 20 & \(\bar{q}_{R}\bar{q}_{R}\) & 11 & 4 \\ \(\bar{g}\bar{q}_{R}\) & 58 & 22 & \(\bar{q}_{L}\bar{q}_{R}\) & 11 & 4 \\ \(\bar{\chi}^{0}\), \(\bar{\chi}^{\pm}\) & 14 & 5 & \(\bar{t}_{1}\bar{t}_{1}\) & 30 & 11 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: SU4 production cross section \(m(\bar{\chi}_{1}^{0})=60\) GeV and the mass of the heaviest SUSY particle which is the second stop squark, \(m(\bar{t}_{2})=445\) GeV. Gluino and left and right squarks have close masses defining SU4 mass scale at: M\({}_{SUSY}=\min(\rm m(\tilde{g}),\,m(\tilde{q}))\sim\,400\) GeV.

SU4 decays and branching ratios are presented in Table 3. With the probability of 93% the gluino is decaying to 3rd generation \(\bar{q}q\). Being only 30 GeV heavier than its SM partner, light stop is decaying to the final states similar to those of top. Squarks \(\bar{b}_{1}\) and \(\tilde{b}_{2}\) decay to \(\bar{t}_{1}W\) with the probability of about 50% and the other decay channels have the 3rd generation quarks and gauginos \(\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\bar{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) in the final state. The gauginos \(\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\bar{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) have the same mass, 30 GeV above the \(W\) boson mass and decay with almost identical branching ratios to the equivalent SM gauge bosons.

Referring to the SU4 decays and the production rates, the majority of SU4 events (70%) is characterised by at least two \(b\) jets in the final state. Transverse momenta of \(b\) and light \(q\) jets in true SU4 events are plotted in Figure 1 for the decays relevant for the further analysis.

\begin{tabular}{|c c c c c c c|} \hline Particle & Mass & Particle & Mass & Particle & Mass & Particle & Mass \\ \hline \(\bar{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) & 60 & \(\tilde{q}_{L}\) & 412 & \(\tilde{e}_{L}\),\(\bar{\mu}_{L}\) & 232 & \(h^{0}\) & 114 \\ \(\bar{\chi}_{2}^{0}\),\(\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) & 113 & \(\bar{q}_{R}\) & 405 & \(\tilde{e}_{R}\),\(\bar{\mu}_{R}\) & 213 & \(H^{0}\) & 370 \\ \(\bar{\chi}_{3}^{0}\) & 309 & \(\bar{t}_{1}\) & 206 & \(\bar{\tau}_{1}\) & 200 & \(A^{0}\) & 368 \\ \(\bar{\chi}_{4}^{0}\),\(\bar{\chi}_{2}^{\pm}\) & 326 & \(\bar{t}_{2}\) & 445 & \(\bar{\tau}_{2}\) & 236 & \(H^{\pm}\) & 379 \\ \(\bar{g}\) & 413 & \(\bar{b}_{1}\) & 358 & \(\bar{\nu}_{e}\),\(\bar{\nu}_{\mu}\) & 212 & & \\  & & \(\bar{b}_{2}\) & 400 & \(\bar{\nu}_{\tau}\) & 216 & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 Inclusive searches

Inclusive searches are sensitive to \(\bar{g}\) decays to 3rd generation squarks which occur in more than 60% of all SU4 events (Table 1 and Table 3). If gluino is produced with left or right squark there are two \(b\) jets in the final state. If gluino is produced with another gluino there are four \(b\) jets in the final state. At least 2 additional jets in the event come from \(W\), \(\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) and \(\bar{\chi}_{2}^{0}\) decays which are dominantly hadronic (Table 3). The hardest jet is either a light \(q\) jet outgoing from \(\bar{q}_{L}\) or \(\bar{q}_{R}\) decay or a \(b\) jet originating from \(\bar{b}_{1}\) produced in the \(\bar{g}\) decay (Figure 1). A missing energy is provided by the two \(\bar{\chi}_{1}^{0}\) in the final state as well as from the neutrinos in the case of \(W\) and gaugino leptonic decays. In order to separate SU4 gluino events from the SM background processes, selection cuts were applied on multijet events with missing transverse energy and jets tagged as \(b\) jets. Event selection:

* At least 5 jets in the event where at least 2 jets are requested to be tagged as \(b\) jets;
* the hardest jet has \(p_{t}(j1)>100\) GeV;
* the other jets have \(p_{t}(j)>p_{t}^{cut}\), \(p_{t}^{cut}\) = 20, 30, 50 GeV;
* \(E_{t}^{miss}>E_{t}^{cut}\), \(E_{t}^{cut}\) = 100, 150 GeV;
* \(E_{t}^{miss}/M_{EFF}>0.2\).

The effective mass of the event was defined as \(M_{EFF}=E_{t}^{miss}+\Sigma p_{t}(j)\) where all reconstructed hadronic jets were used. In the last request, regarding \(E_{t}^{miss}\) fraction of the effective mass, typical SUSY cut was used.

The effective mass of the SU4 signal and SM background events satisfying selection criteria for the inclusive searches is plotted in Figure 2. The number of corresponding events is listed in Table 6. The results are normalised to integrated luminosity L = 200 pb\({}^{-1}\). Regarding datasets used for the SM backgrounds (Table 4) T1, A7 and J6 events remain after applying selection cuts, while J1, J3, J5, Z\(\nu\nu\)j, ZZlj, ZZ\(\nu\)j and Zbb4l events do not. Consequently, \(Z+jets\) and most of the \(multijet\) processes are suppressed by the selection cuts. Remaining processes are \(t\bar{t}\) dominantly and \(W+jets\). The strongest cut against the \(t\bar{t}\) events is a cut on a missing transverse energy.

Event selection efficiency can be estimated from the numbers of selected (Table 6) and generated events corresponding to the luminosity L = 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) (Table 5). Event selection efficiency for the SU4 gluino events and the remaining SM backgrounds is listed in the Table 7. At low luminosity jet tagging efficiency is higher than 90% for \(p_{t}(j)>20\) GeV [1], [7] and a typical \(b\) tagging efficiency is 60% with the mistag probability 2 - 3% [8], [9].

For the effective mass above 400 GeV, a 150 GeV cut on \(E_{t}^{miss}\) suppresses the Standard Model backgrounds to the S/B level of 2.82 for \(p_{t}(j)>20\) GeV and 3.36 for \(p_{t}(j)>30\) GeV (Table 6). A 50 GeV cut on jet transverse momenta strongly suppresses the signal giving lower value of the S/B ratio.

Figure 2: The effective mass of the SU4 signal and SM backgrounds satisfying selection criteria for the inclusive searches with \(E_{t}^{miss}>100\) GeV (left) and \(E_{t}^{miss}>150\) GeV (right) and \(p_{t}(j)>20\) GeV (above), \(p_{t}(j)>30\) GeV (middle), \(p_{t}(j)>50\) GeV (below). The number of events is normalised to integrated luminosity L = 200 pb\({}^{-1}\).

The SU4 signal statistical significance SU4/\(\sqrt{\rm B}_{SM}\) at the luminosity 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) is given in Table 6 for all applied combinations of cuts. Including only the statistical errors on the SM background rates \(\sqrt{\rm B}_{SM}\)/B\({}_{SM}\) which are of the order of a few percents (Table 6), the SU4 signal significance is far above 5, requested for discovery. The maximal error on the SM background rate for which the signal significance remains above five, evaluated as \(\sqrt{\rm B}_{SM}^{max}\leq\) S/5, \(\sqrt{\rm B}_{SM}^{max}\)/B\({}_{SM}\sim\) 0.40 - 0.60, is for an order of magnitude higher than the statistical error from the Table 6. Even if statistical uncertainties are highly dominated by the systematic ones, the SU4 supersymmetric signal might have significance of about five standard deviations with 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data.

## 5 Light stop search

In order to observe light stop signal in the SU4 low mass SUSY model, gluino decay to light stop and top

\[\bar{g}\rightarrow\bar{t}_{1}t\rightarrow\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}tb \tag{1}\]

was analysed. In the decay (1) the final state _tb_ invariant mass distribution has the upper kinematic endpoint attained when the top and the bottom are back to back in the rest frame of the stop:

\[M^{max}(\emph{tb})=\left[m_{t}^{2}+\frac{m_{\bar{t}_{1}}^{2}-m_{\bar{\chi}_{1 }^{\pm}}^{2}}{2m_{\bar{t}_{1}}^{2}}\left((m_{\bar{g}}^{2}-m_{\bar{t}_{1}}^{2}- m_{t}^{2})+\sqrt{(m_{\bar{g}}^{2}-(m_{\bar{t}_{1}}-m_{t})^{2})(m_{\bar{g}}^{2}-(m_{ \bar{t}_{1}}+m_{t})^{2})}\right)\right]^{1/2}. \tag{2}\]

With \(\bar{g}\), \(\bar{t}_{1}\) and \(\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) masses from the Table 2 and a top mass of 175 GeV, Formula (2) gives

\[M^{max}(\emph{tb})\sim 300\emph{GeV}. \tag{3}\]

SU4 decays giving the same final state are:

\[\bar{g} \rightarrow \bar{b}_{1}b\rightarrow\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}tb, \tag{4}\] \[\bar{g} \rightarrow \bar{b}_{1}b\rightarrow\bar{t}_{1}Wb\rightarrow\bar{\chi}_{1}^{ \pm}bbW,\] (5) \[\bar{g} \rightarrow \bar{b}_{2}b\rightarrow\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}tb,\] (6) \[\bar{g} \rightarrow \bar{b}_{2}b\rightarrow\bar{t}_{1}Wb\rightarrow\bar{\chi}_{1}^{ \pm}bbW. \tag{7}\]

The final states from the decays (5) and (7) are equivalent to the final state from the decay (1) if \(bW\) invariant mass is close to the top mass. Corresponding branching ratios are listed in Table 3. Assuming gluino production with left or right squark (Table 1), decay (1) occurs in 18%, decay (4) in 4%, decay (5) in 9%, decay (6) in 0.1% and the decay (7) in 0.9% of all SU4 events. Due to the low transverse momenta of the \(b\) jets outgoing from the gluino decay \(\bar{g}\rightarrow\bar{b}_{1}b\) (Figure 1), the final states (4) and (5) can be suppressed by imposing a cut on \(b\) jets \(p_{t}\). The final state _tb_ invariant mass distribution in true SU4 events for three decays with the same final state (1), (4) and (5) without and with 50 GeV cut on \(b\) jets transverse momenta is plotted in Figure 3. As the mass difference between \(\bar{g}\) and \(\bar{b}_{2}\) is only 13 GeV, \(b\) jets originating from the gluino decay \(\bar{g}\rightarrow\bar{b}_{2}b\) are on the average below the detection threshold thus suppressing the final states (6) and (7).

In order to extract light stop signal from the \(\bar{g}\bar{q}_{L/R}\) events where gluino decays to stop and top (1), the final state _tb_ invariant mass distribution in the decay (1) was reconstructed assuming only top quark decay into hadronic final states:

\[t\to Wb\to qqb \tag{8}\]and with no assumptions on \(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1}\) decays which are dominantly giving 2 additional light \(q\) jets with low transverse momenta (Figure 1). The hardest jet in the event is a light \(q\) jet originating from the decay of left or right squark produced with the gluino.

Event selection was performed on the set of reconstructed events used for the inclusive searches demanding \(j1\) is a light \(q\) jet, requesting strictly 2 jets in the event to be tagged as \(b\) jets and imposing a cut on the effective mass. Event selection:

* At least 5 jets in the event where
* the hardest jet is a light \(q\) jet with \(p_{t}(j1)>\) 100 GeV;
* at least 2 light \(q\) jets in the event with \(p_{t}(j)>\) 20 GeV;
* strictly 2 jets tagged as \(b\) jets with \(p_{t}(b)>\) 50 GeV;
* \(E_{t}^{miss}>\) 150 GeV;
* \(E_{t}^{miss}/M_{EFF}>\) 0.2;
* \(M_{EFF}>\) 400 GeV.

The effective mass of the SU4 signal and SM backgrounds satisfying selection criteria for the light stop search is plotted in Figure 4. The remaining background events come from T1, A7 and J6 datasets. Event selection efficiency is estimated to 3.81% for signal, 0.10% for T1, 0.01% for A7 and is negligible for J6 events.

Top - bottom invariant mass was reconstructed on the same events satisfying the above criteria for the light stop search. Top - bottom invariant mass reconstruction:

* Excluding the hardest j1, all light \(q\) jets with transverse momenta above 20 GeV were combined in \(jj\) pairs.

Figure 3: The final state _tb_ invariant mass distribution in true SU4 events for three decays with the same final state, without and with 50 GeV cut on \(b\) jets transverse momenta.

* All pairs inside the \(W\) mass region defined as \(m_{W}\pm\) 15 GeV, i.e. with the invariant mass \(|M(jj)-m_{W}|<\) 15 GeV were combined with each of the two \(b\) jets and the \(jjb\) combination with a mass closest to the top mass was selected as top candidate if \(|M(jjb)-m_{top}|<\) 30 GeV.
* The same \(jjb\) combination was coupled with the other \(b\) jet for \(M(tb)\).

SUSY combinatorial background originates from the supersymmetric processes where jet pairs accidentally have the invariant mass within the \(W\) region thus forming fake \(W\) bosons. SUSY background was estimated by using \(W\) sideband method [1], [11] which evaluates fake \(W\) boson contribution to the top mass reconstruction from the decay (8) and consequently to the top - bottom mass reconstruction from the decay (1). \(W\) sidebands were defined as mass regions of 30 GeV below and 30 GeV above the \(W\) mass region. Fake \(W\) bosons contribution was evaluated as the average contribution of the jet pairs from the \(W\) sidebands after they had been scaled linearly to the \(W\) mass region. A detailed description of the method is given in the reference [11]. A reliability of the \(W\) sideband method regarding the underestimate of the fake \(W\) rate is discussed in the reference [12].

The number of SU4 signal and SM background events which are satisfying selection criteria for the light stop search, for which \(M(tb)\) is reconstructed and which are remaining after SUSY background had been subtracted is listed in Table 8. Reconstructed \(tb\) invariant mass distribution is plotted in Figure 5. The results are normalised to integrated luminosity L = 200 pb\({}^{-1}\). Dominant remaining SM background events are \(t\bar{t}\) from the T1 dataset, making main contribution to the S/B\({}_{SM}\) ratio in the selected events: 2.47 and in the events where \(M(tb)\) was reconstructed: 4.12 without and 2.95 with SUSY background subtraction (Table 8). Including only the statistical errors on the SM background rates the SU4 signal significance is far above 5 at the luminosity 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) (Table 8). SUSY combinatorial background dominates over the SM backgrounds giving S/B\({}_{susy}\) = 1.38.

When the same analysis was performed with a 100 GeV cut on the missing transverse energy, lower S/B\({}_{SM}\) ratio was obtained: 1.75 in the selected events, 2.90 in the events with \(M(tb)\) reconstructed and 1.97 in the events remaining after SUSY background subtraction. Corresponding values of the SU4 signal statistical significance at 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) were above 5.

The last row gives the S/B\({}_{susy}\) ratio. The number of events is normalised to L = 200 pb\({}^{-1}\).

SUSY background and the fit of signal \(M(\mathit{tb})\) distribution after SUSY background had been subtracted (right). The number of events is normalised to integrated luminosity L = 200 pb\({}^{-1}\).

SUSY background was at the level S/B\({}_{susy}\) = 1.30. If a 30 GeV cut on the light \(q\) jets transverse momenta was requested with \(E_{t}^{miss}>\) 100 (150) GeV almost twice less signal events remained then with \(p_{t}(j)>\) 20 GeV, giving lower S/B\({}_{SM}\) ratio. Even with \(p_{t}(j)>\) 30 GeV the signal statistical significance at 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) was above 5. The S/B\({}_{susy}\) ratio obtained with \(p_{t}(j)>\) 30 GeV was higher than with \(p_{t}(j)>\) 20 GeV due to the suppression of the soft jets originating from the \(\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) decays.

After SUSY background had been subtracted the signal \(M(tb)\) distribution (Figure 5) was fitted to the function:

\[f(M)=A\int_{-1}^{1}e^{-\frac{(M-M^{max}\sqrt{\frac{1+x}{2}})^{2}}{2x^{2}}}dx+( a+bM),\]

where the Gaussian part represents the reconstructed signal \(tb\) invariant mass distribution and the linear part represents SUSY background unsuppressed by the \(W\) sideband method. The Gaussian smearing \(\sigma\) defines the experimental resolution of the reconstructed signal \(M(tb)\) caused by the jet energy resolution. The smearing parameter \(\sigma\) was set to 10% of the kinematic endpoint \(M^{max}\) based on the mass resolution in dijet measurements at ATLAS [1]. In that way the number of fitting parameters was reduced from five to four: \(A\), \(M^{max}\), \(a\) and \(b\). Linear fit was applied to the events above the endpoint. The enlarged number of events around 400 GeV on the fit plot in the Figure 5 is most likely a statistical anomaly. The signal \(M(tb)\) distribution after SUSY background subtraction, reconstructed on the events selected with \(p_{t}(j)>\) 20 GeV and \(E_{t}^{miss}>\) 100 GeV as well as on the events selected with \(p_{t}(j)>\) 30 GeV and \(E_{t}^{miss}>\) 150 GeV is plotted in Figure 6. The upper kinematic endpoint of the reconstructed signal \(M(tb)\) distribution obtained from the fit is (307 \(\pm\) 14) GeV for 56 events remaining in the selection with \(p_{t}(j)>\) 20 GeV and \(E_{t}^{miss}>\) 150 GeV (Figure 5), (314 \(\pm\) 16) GeV for 57 events remaining in the selection with \(p_{t}(j)>\) 20 GeV and \(E_{t}^{miss}>\) 100 GeV (Figure 6) and (339 \(\pm\) 16) GeV for 36 events remaining in the selection with \(p_{t}(j)>\) 30 GeV and \(E_{t}^{miss}>\) 150 GeV (Figure 6). The expected value is 300 GeV (3).

Right squark search

Cambridge m\({}_{T2}\) variable is defined for the events with the two undetectable decay products [13]. It can be applied on right squark pair events (\(\bar{q}_{R}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}q\)) where the final state has two hard light \(q\) jets and the missing transverse energy originating from the two lightest neutralinos \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\). If applied to \(\bar{q}_{R}\bar{q}_{R}\) events, m\({}_{T2}\) variable is formed from the two final state jets transverse momenta \(p_{t}(j1)\), \(p_{t}(j2)\) and the two dummy vectors \(\vec{k}_{t}(1)\), \(\vec{k}_{t}(2)\) which are introduced due to the unknown transverse energies of the two undetectable \(\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1}\) and constrained by the \(\vec{E}^{miss}_{t}\) of the event: \(\vec{k}_{t}(1)+\vec{k}_{t}(2)=\vec{E}^{miss}_{t}\). In the case of right squark pair events m\({}_{T2}\) variable is constructed as:

\[m^{2}_{T2} =\min_{\vec{k}_{t}(1)+\vec{k}_{t}(2)=\vec{E}^{miss}_{t}}\left[ \max\left\{m^{2}_{T}\left(\vec{p}_{t}(j1),\vec{k}_{t}(1),m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{ 1}}\right),m^{2}_{T}\left(\vec{p}_{t}(j2),\vec{k}_{t}(2),m_{\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{ 1}}\right)\right\}\right].\]

The distribution of the m\({}_{T2}\) variable has the upper kinematical endpoint at the position of the mass of the decaying particle [13] which is \(\bar{q}_{R}\) in this case.

Right squark pair events represent 4% of SU4 production (Table 1). In order to separate \(\bar{q}_{R}\bar{q}_{R}\) events from the SM backgrounds event selection was performed on pure hadronic events with \(E^{miss}_{t}\):

* no \(b\) jets, no \(e\), no \(\mu\) and no \(\tau\) leptons;
* 2 light \(q\) jets with \(p_{t}(j)>100\) GeV and \(|\eta(j)|<2\), forming the angle \(\Delta R>1\);
* \(E^{miss}_{t}>\) 100 GeV;
* \(E^{miss}_{t}/M_{EFF}>\) 0.2.

The m\({}_{T2}\) variable, reconstructed on the SU4 signal and SM background events satisfying selection criteria for the right squark search, is plotted in Figure 7. The results are

normalised to integrated luminosity L = 200 pb\({}^{-1}\). Most of the remaining background events come from the A7 dataset, while the others come from the Z\(\nu\nu\)j, T1 and J6 datasets. Event selection efficiency is estimated to 42.18% for SU4 right squark pairs, 0.34% for A7, 0.08% for Z\(\nu\nu\)j, 0.04% for T1 and 0.03 for J6 events.

The number of SU4 signal and SM background events satisfying selection criteria for the right squark search is listed in Table 9 for m\({}_{T2}\) values above 150 GeV. Absolutely dominant remaining SM background process is \(W+jets\) which is decreasing S/B ratio to the level 1.04. Including only statistical errors on the SM background rates, \(\sqrt{\rm B}_{SM}\)/B\({}_{SM}\) = 0.04, the signal significance is far above 5 at the luminosity 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) (Table 9).

The upper kinematic endpoint obtained from the linear fit of SU4 m\({}_{T2}\) distribution is 407 \(\pm\) 14 GeV (Figure 7). The SU4 right squark mass value is given in the Table 2. The fit error does not include systematic errors which are mainly originating from the jet energy resolution: \(\sigma_{E}/E=(60-80)\%\ /\sqrt{E}+(6-8)\%\)[10] and a missing energy resolution: \(\sigma=0.5\times\sqrt{\Sigma E_{t}}\)[1]. Most of the jets selected for the right squark search have transverse momentum within the interval 100 - 200 GeV. Consequently, a missing energy resolution is estimated to 7 - 10 GeV. For the jet energy domain defined by the same transverse momentum interval and the pseudorapidity cut applied in the event selection, jet energy resolution is estimated to 15 - 20 GeV.

## 7 Summary and conclusions

SU4 low mass SUSY model was studied at ATLAS with full Geant4 simulation. With a production cross section of 270 pb and masses in the range 60 - 450 GeV, SU4 seems to be a promissing target for SUSY searches with early ATLAS data. An excess of events due to the presence of supersymmetric processes may be observed in the multijet events with missing energy and \(b\) jets, which were analysed for the inclusive and light stop searches, as well as in the pure hadronic events with missing energy and no \(b\) jets, analysed for the right squark search. By establishing proper event selection criteria, in each of these searches the excess of SU4 events against the Standard Model backgrounds has the statistical

significance far above 5 standard deviations with only 200 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data.

Inclusive searches are sensitive to gluino decays to 3rd generation squarks which occur in more than 60% of all SU4 events. Standard Model backgrounds, originating from the \(t\bar{t}\), \(W+jets\), \(Z+jets\) and \(multijet\) processes, can be suppressed to the level S/B \(>\) 2.8 with proper event selection criteria. Mean value of the effective mass in the SU4 events M\({}_{EFF}\sim\) 700 GeV is above the SU4 mass scale M\({}_{SUSY}\sim\) 400 GeV.

In order to extract a light stop signal from the decay \(\bar{g}\to\bar{t}_{1}\)\(t\to tb\bar{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\) the final state \(tb\) invariant mass distribution was reconstructed. A kinematic endpoint was observed at a position close to the expected value for this decay chain which is 300 GeV. The S/B ratio is 4.12 for SM and 1.38 for SUSY background. The dominant remaining SM background process is a top pair production.

In order to extract a right squark signal from the right squark pair events the distribution of the Cambridge m\({}_{T2}\) variable was reconstructed with the upper kinematic limit at the position consistent to the SU4 right squark mass value. The dominant remaining SM background is a \(W+jets\) process which is decreasing S/B ratio to the level close to one.
