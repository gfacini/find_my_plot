## 1 Introduction

**In the forward part of the ATLAS inner tracker, we are planning to have an integrated MSGC/TRD setup. Most of the volume is used for generation and detection of transition radiation and global tracking of charged particles, while at the edges of this volume rings of MSGCs provide the accurate measurements needed for the determination of** \(p_{\rm t}\)**. The layout is shown in figure** 1**. This note describes the algorithm used for determining the position of the MSGCs in** \(z\) **and their radial extension. These positions are incorporated in the January release of DICE. There are quite a few parameters involved in a proper calculation of the positions. In listing them all we take the risk to be boring, but it does make the evolving list of numbers reproducible.**

**Currently we aim at having one full MSGC wheel in front of the TRD/T, and two wheels behind it.**

## 2 Radial extension of the MSGCs

**The TRD/T suffers from the presence of the MSGC wheels because they absorb TR photons. (The MSGC wheels are currently estimated to have an average radiation thickness of around 1.5% X.) It is therefore important to push the MSGCs as much out of the TRD/T as possible. On the other hand, the shorter we make the MSGC strips radially, the more wheels we need to come to the minimal number of 2+2 crossed planes for stiff tracks at \(1.7<\eta<2.6\). More wheels effectively mean less room for the TRD/T.**

**MSGC strips are routinely fabricated on substrates up to 4 inch. This means that a strip length around 9-9.5 cm is optimal w.r.t. production cost. It seems that industry will have major difficulties producing tiles with strips longer than 16 cm. This is now our design maximum.**

**Strips between 40 and 50 cm in** \(r\) **have an occupancy of approx. 1%, and between 84 and 100 cm they have a 0.5% occupancy but a larger stereo overlap (longer strips). This is a reasonable occupancy to aim at. Therefore the detectors at the innerrings of the hollow (= non-end) wheels were chosen to have a radialextension from 40 to 49.5 cm. The inner and outer radius of the outer detectors are 84 and 100 cm. The full wheels at the beginning and at the end of the TRD/T have detectors such that the radial area from 40 and 100 cm is covered. All given radii refer to the sensitive volume of the MSGCs. Current estimates indicate that on top of that, we will need around 1 cm at the inner radius, and 3 cm at the outer radius, forelectronics, support etc. Still, the inner MSGC rings hardly enter the TRD/T active volume (which starts at 50 cm); the outer rings are totally embedded in the TRD/T active volume which cannot be avoided within the given space.

## 3 \(z\)-positions of the MSGC wheels

The \(z\)-positions of the MSGC wheels are of course influenced mostly by the position of the barrel tracker, the forward E-cal and the requirement of a minimal number of MSGC measurements for each track. In addition, if we wish to build up the TRD/T from standard modules with a fixed thickness in \(z\), this imposes another condition on the MSGC positions. The input to the position determination done here was the following:

* **The forward tracker starts at \(z\)=105 cm and ends at \(z\)=340 cm;**
* **a full MSGC wheel is 5.0 cm wide in \(z\), and a hollow wheel is 2.5 cm wide;**
* **In a hollow wheel, the MSGC is placed in the middle of the 2.5 cm. In a full wheel, the innermost and the outermost MSGC rings are located in the middle of the first 2.5 cm (so they are not at the center but 1.25 cm more towards \(z\) = 0).**
* **each stiff track from the vertex (out to \(\pm\) 2 \(\sigma\).) should cross at least two inner and two outer MSGCs.**
* **A TRD/T module is either 7.0 cm or 10.2 cm wide, having 8 and 12 straw layers respectively plus 6 mm for the supports. These numbers were input from RD6, and follow from recent design studies.**

This input and the input from section 2 almost fixes the positions of the rings; only the positions of the second wheel and the last wheels are still ambiguous. We have simply set as a border condition that there are as many TRD/T modules behind wheel 2 as behind wheel 1. The last (full) wheels should be as far out in \(z\) as possible so as to maximise the TRD/T volume. On the other hand, putting them too close together has a negative effect on the pattern recognition power (the vectors that are reconstructed in the end wheels need some pointing ability). If the distance between the first and last end wheel is around 10 cm the track reconstruction seems safe. So we reserve 15 cm for the end wheels; the TRD/T then runsout to \(\pm\) 325 cm in \(z\).

**With a fixed position of the end wheels, when we calculate the position of the hollow wheels, the last hollow wheel will in general endup closer to the end wheel then to its hollow neighbour. This will cause a local increase in the average number of crossed planes right in the corner of the tracking volume, where the amount of material is already problematic. Therefore we modify the arrangement of the hollow wheels as follows. First, we set the last hollow wheel equidistant (within TRD modularity constraints) between its neighbouring wheels. Then we make a list of the distances between the hollow MSGC-wheels. We sort this list and then reposition all MSGC wheels at the distances given by the sorted list. The resulting set upshowsagradual increase in the distance between the MSGC wheels, and nod decrease just before the end wheels.**

**A small program was written to position the detectors using this algorithm. Starting with the first threeinner wheels (positioned such that the room left for TRD/T modules is equal), it will calculate the fourth \(z\)-position from the wish that it takes over from layer 2 when \(\eta\) becomes to large to cross layer 2. Then the program tries to fit as many TRD/T modules in between as possible, and shifts back the MSGC ring to where the last TRD/T ring ends. All other rings are positioned the same way.**

**Running this program, the inner part of the MSGC tracker is automatically crack-free, but to get the outer parti right some tunings should be done. Without any tuning, the radial extension of the outer rings should be from 81 to 100 cm to avoid cracks. We aim at having strips no longer than 16 cm, so this solution gives slightly too long strips. If we decrease the inner MSGC radii to 41 and 49.5 cm, the outer detector with 16 cm strips becomes crack free. (This change makes the MSGC wheels move closer together.) This is shown in fig. 1. The \(z\)-positions of the MSGC wheels are given in table 1, the abovementioned input parameters are listed in table 2. Note that the change in inner radii was only to force a proper positioning for the outer rings; in the figure the radii are 40 and 49.5 cm again.**

**The shown layout has 17 TRD modules of 7.0 cm, and 6 modules of 10.2 cm. The average number of crossed MSGC planes is plotted in fig. 2. This figure is produced with a gaussian spread of the vertex with a sigma of 5.6 cm. In the region where only the outer tracker is used (\(1.1<\eta<1.7\)) the average number of hits is 3.4. (No other than MSGC detectors are included in the graph; the barrel detectors will add to the total number of points on a track in this region.) In the region where both inner and outer MSGC s are crossed (\(1.7<\eta<2.6\)), the average number of crossings is 4.8.**

## 4 Conclusions

**The presented forward tracker layout consists of 2\(\times\)17 small and 2\(\times\)6 large TRD modules, adding up to 208 TRD monolayers on each side in \(z\). It has 2\(\times\)3 solidMSGC wheels and 2\(\times\)13 hollow wheels, occupying in total 47.5 cm in \(z\) on each side.

The program used for determination of the MSGC positions can be found at the csf, in directory /u1/zp/bosk/fortran/zdisc.
