**Abstract**

This note deals with techniques for estimating QCD multijet backgrounds to inclusive jets + \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) + leptons searches for Supersymmetry. The note documents how the backgrounds may be estimated using a data set with an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) or less. The likely systematic and statistical uncertainties in such estimates are also discussed. Data-driven approaches discussed include jet smearing with functions derived from data and techniques for background estimation using control samples. Monte Carlo based techniques using a variety of generators and simulation tools are also discussed with a view to establishing their likely precisions and hence the optimum simulation strategy.

Introduction

In searches for supersymmetry in events containing jets and missing transverse energy (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) ) the biggest background-determination challenge will be in understanding QCD jet events. Although fast simulation studies [1] indicate that such backgrounds should be sub-dominant in the high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  and large jet multiplicity region, the situation with real data is still uncertain, and likely to be less favourable for SUSY searches. In particular non-Gaussian tails to the detector jet response function, which can be caused by dead material, jet punch-through, pile-up of machine backgrounds and other effects, can dramatically increase the cross-section of high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  QCD background. QCD jet events in which such processes have occurred shall be referred to in this note as "fake" \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  events in what follows, since in such events the net \(p_{T}\) of non-interacting particles measured in a perfect detector is inherently small. Events in which the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  vector is dominated by contributions from non-interacting particles such as neutrinos or the Lightest Supersymmetric Particle (in the case of SUSY signal) shall be referred to as "real" \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  events.

Accurate estimation of QCD jet backgrounds is difficult for a number of reasons. Processes generating fake \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  from event mis-measurement are expected to be poorly modeled in current GEANT4[2] simulations - this situation will improve once validation has been performed with real data. Furthermore theoretical and experimental uncertainties will conspire to decrease further the systematic precision of Monte Carlo estimates while the large QCD cross-section will limit statistical precision by rendering production of unbiased GEANT4 samples corresponding to more than a few pb\({}^{-1}\) unfeasible. This note addresses these problems, assessing the relative magnitudes of some of the uncertainties, identifying techniques for minimising the contribution of such backgrounds in the SUSY signal region and studying novel Monte Carlo- and data-driven approaches to accurate background estimation. It should be understood that the background estimates presented here are not intended to be definitive; rather the focus is on developing and evaluating the performance of tools for future use. This note should be read in conjunction with the notes outlining ATLAS \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  performance [3], data-driven estimation strategies for \(W\), \(Z\) and top backgrounds [4] and inclusive SUSY searches [5]. The main variables sensitive to the presence of SUSY signal which have been considered in this note are \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  and the 'effective mass' defined by \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}=\sum_{i=1}^{4}|p_{T}(j_{i})|+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)[5], where the sum runs over the four leading jets satisfying the conditions described below.

Wherever possible events appearing in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  or \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) distributions have been selected with a standard jet selection requiring at least four jets with \(p_{T}>50\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), at least one of which must have \(p_{T}>100\) GeV. In some sections describing studies of new simulation techniques with limited available simulation statistics these cuts have been relaxed - these cases are highlighted in the text. In addition the performance of the different background estimation techniques has been compared by assessing the uncertainties of the background estimates for events passing a standard baseline set of cuts for the jets \(+\)\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  + 0-lepton (1-lepton for Section 5.2) channel described elsewhere in this volume [5].

## 2 Fake \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  rejection

### Jet fiducialisation in \(\eta\)

In QCD multijet events the generation of large fake \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  from jets falling in poorly instrumented regions of the detector is a significant mechanism by which such events mimic SUSY signal. Conversely the large number of such events means they can provide a useful in-situ probe of the the ability of the detector to measure \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). Here we consider the use of such events for defining non-fiducial regions where jets may be expected to be poorly measured and hence capable of generating significant fake \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\).

The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)  resolution of the ATLAS detector is known to scale with \(\sqrt{\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}}\)[6], where \(\Sigma E_{\mathrm{T}}\) is the scalar sum over the transverse energies of all calorimeter objects. For this reason the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) -significancedefined by \(S=E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}/\sqrt{\sum E_{\rm T}}\) is frequently used to distinguish real \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) from fake \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). Because QCD multijet events typically have little energy in invisible particles the value of \(\langle S\rangle\) is determined by the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm\,miss}\) resolution of the detector. Much of the variance in \(S\) is due to intrinsic shower fluctuations, but because the reconstructed \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) is dominated by the transverse energy near the highest-\(p_{T}\) jets, some is due to the non-uniformity in energy resolution of the detector. A measurement of \(\langle S\rangle\) in a sample of events in which one of the highest-\(p_{T}\) jets points into a particular region of the calorimeter can therefore be used as a measure of the relative performance of that region.

In this study, the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm\,miss}\) -significance of QCD jet events was used to calculate \(\langle S\rangle\) in \(\eta\) bins across the calorimeter. Each event \(S\) value was used in two \(\eta\) bins - one for each of the two highest-\(p_{T}\) jets. The same techniques could be used generate a full \((\eta,\phi)\) map of the calorimeter. A sample of PYTHIA[7] simulated QCD jet events with \(p_{T}>280\) GeV and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 23.8 pb\({}^{-1}\) was used for the study [8]. Events were required to pass the 160 GeV high-level single-jet trigger [9] and to possess at least two high-\(p_{T}\) jets with \(p_{T}(j_{1})>100\) GeV and \(p_{T}(j_{2})>50\) GeV. These two jets were required to be back-to-back in the transverse plane such that \(\pi-|\Delta\phi(j_{1},j_{2})|<0.4\). Events were vetoed if they contained an isolated lepton with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) or if \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) was greater than 80 GeV. The \(\Delta\phi\) and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cuts eliminate contamination from events with significant true \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), eg. \(Z\) (\(\rightarrow\)\(\nu\bar{\nu}\) ) + jets and heavy quark jets. While the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cut does, in principle, prohibit the identification of catastrophically unresponsive regions with this method, regions with consistently poor response would be readily identifiable via the relative deficiency of events with jets pointing into them.

The resulting calorimeter map is shown in Fig. 1. The degraded response in the tile barrel and tile barrel-extended barrel gaps (\(\eta\sim 0\) and \(0.6<|\eta|<0.8\)) and the LAr barrel-endcap and hadronic LAr-forward calorimeter transition regions (\(1.3<|\eta|<1.5\) and \(3.1<|\eta|<3.3\)) are all clearly visible. The principal application of these data is to define non-fiducial regions of the detector, such that events with jets pointing into these regions can be rejected. Defining a cut value \(\langle S\rangle_{\rm\,min}\) on \(\langle S\rangle\), a region is defined to be non-fiducial if \(\langle S\rangle>\langle S\rangle_{\rm\,min}\) in all of the corresponding bins in the calorimeter map (Fig. 1) and if \(\langle S\rangle-\langle S\rangle_{\rm\,min}>3\epsilon\) in at least one of those bins, where \(\epsilon\) is the uncertainty on the mean \(\langle S\rangle\). Fig.1 also shows the non-fiducial regions obtained in this way with \(\langle S\rangle_{\rm\,min}=0.95\).

The jet fiducialisation process has been tested on the QCD jet sample which was used to define the regions and also on SUSY events from model point SU3 [10]. Events were required to satisfy the jet cuts listed in Section 1 and events with a jet with \(p_{T}>40\) GeV pointing into one of the non-fiducial regions depicted in Fig.1 were rejected. The efficiency of these cuts for the QCD and SUSY samples was \((74.8\pm 0.4)\%\) and \((75.4\pm 0.6)\%\) respectively for \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm\,miss}>0\) GeV, and \((67.5\pm 3.7)\%\) and \((75.5\pm 0.7)\%\) for \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>100\) GeV. The effect of these cuts on the simulated data-samples is clearly small however

Figure 1: \(\langle E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}/\sqrt{\sum E_{T}}\rangle\) vs. \(\eta_{j}\), where \(j\) is the first or second highest-\(p_{T}\) jet in each event (points). The non-fiducial regions selected with a cut at 0.95 (dashed line) are also shown (shaded areas; see text). These regions correspond to the LAr barrel-endcap and HEC-forward transition regions.

they may be of more use with real data acquired with an imperfect detector, and the technique could be used as an on-line monitor of calorimeter performance.

### Jet-\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)\(\phi\) correlations

One of the main methods used to reduce the QCD multijet background in \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)\(+\) jets inclusive SUSY searches at the Tevatron has been the elimination of events in which the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is closely associated with one of the leading jets in the transverse plane [11, 12]. This section provides a brief exploration of this method of background elimination in ATLAS.

Fig. 2 shows the \(|\Delta\phi(j_{1},E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})|-|\Delta\phi(j_{2},E_{\mathrm{ T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})|\) plane for events from the QCD multijet sample described in Section 2.1 which pass the jet cuts described in Section 1 and possess \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>100\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\) (note that this sample has at least one jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>280\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\)\(-\) significantly higher than the SUSY leading-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement of 100\(\mathrm{GeV}\)). Almost all events are confined to small regions around \((\pi,0)\) and \((0,\pi)\), with a small number of events in which the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is not associated with one of the two highest-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (reconstructed) jets lying outside these regions. For comparison, the \(|\Delta\phi(j_{1},E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})|-|\Delta\phi(j_{2},E_{\mathrm{ T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})|\)

Figure 3: The \(\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{min}}\) distribution for QCD multijet (solid line) and SU3 SUSY (dashed line) events passing the SUSY jet cuts and with \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>100\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\), as described in the text. Good discrimination is achieved with a cut at \(\Delta\phi_{\mathrm{min}}=0.2\) (vertical dotted line).

plane for events from a SUSY (SU3 model) sample [8] passing the above cuts is shown in Fig. 2. No such correlation with \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) is observed for this SUSY benchmark point.

For the purposes of background reduction, this technique can be generalised by considering three correlations between the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) vector and the leading three jets by defining \(\Delta\phi_{\rm min}\) as:

\[\Delta\phi_{\rm min}={\rm min}(\Delta\phi(j_{1},E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}),\Delta \phi(j_{2},E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}),\Delta\phi(j_{3},E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss})). \tag{1}\]

The \(\Delta\phi_{\rm min}\) distribution for the QCD and SUSY samples passing the SUSY jet cuts and with \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>100\) GeV are shown in Fig. 3. Also shown is the position of a cut at \(\Delta\phi_{\rm min}>0.2\) used in Ref. [5].

### Calorimeter and tracking cuts

Events in which jet reconstruction problems lead to fake \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) can be identified with several variables [3]. Cuts on the fraction of the total energy of the jet (\(E_{\rm Total}\)) deposited in the outermost layers of the tile calorimeter \(E_{\rm Tile2}\) and in the hadronic endcap calorimeter \(E_{\rm HEC}\) can be defined to veto events with likely problems in jet containment. Additional cuts on the fraction of the jet energy deposited in the cryostat between the tile and the liquid argon (\(E_{\rm Cryo}\) - estimated from the energy in the closest calorimeter layers) and in the gap and crack scintillators (\(E_{\rm Gap}\)) can be used to reject events with large depositions in dead material. It is also possible to identify events in which there have been problems reconstructing the missing transverse momentum by comparing the value calculated from charged tracks (\(E_{\rm T,Ttk}^{\rm miss}\) ) with the usual calorimetric \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\).

Table 1 shows the cross-section of SU3 signal and multijet background following application of the SUSY jet cuts described in Section 1 together with a cut requiring \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)\(>\)100 GeV, and in addition applying the fake \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) cleaning cuts discussed above. The latter cuts were applied to jets with \(p_{T}>150\) GeV with the following acceptance criteria : \(E_{\rm Tile2}/E_{\rm Total}<0.1\), \(E_{\rm Cryo}/E_{\rm Total}<0.2\), \(E_{\rm Gap}/E_{\rm Total}<0.2\), \(E_{\rm HEC}/E_{\rm Total}<0.5\) and \(E_{\rm T,Ttk}^{\rm miss}-E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}<50\) GeV. Note that the specific cut values are analysis dependent and should be adapted for other cases. The table shows that the cleaning cuts are effective at removing between 40% (low \(p_{T}\)) and 70% (high \(p_{T}\)) of the multijet background, while rejecting \(\sim\)30% of the remaining signal after selection cuts.

### Cosmic backgrounds and rejection cuts

Searches for supersymmetry must contend with backgrounds in which fake \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) arises from a variety of sources. Examples in which the fake \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) is generated independently from a hard scatter include dead or noisy calorimeter channels, accelerator-related background and cosmic rays in which a muon undergoes a hard bremsstrahlung. A range of data-cleaning tools is being prepared to reject fake \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) in ATLAS; here we focus on timing information from the hadronic tile calorimeter (TileCal). As one gains a better understanding of the first data, this will be combined with information from other subdetectors.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline Sample & No cuts [pb] & Selection cuts [pb] & Cleaning cuts [pb] \\ \hline SUSY SU3 & 27.51 & \(9.654\pm 0.019\) & \(6.792\pm 0.016\) \\ QCD (280 GeV \(<p_{T}<\) 560 GeV) & 1.25\(\times 10^{4}\) & \(17.2\pm 1.3\) & \(9.7\pm 1.0\) \\ QCD (560 GeV \(<p_{T}<\) 1120 GeV) & 360.0 & \(4.22\pm 0.13\) & \(1.805\pm 0.082\) \\ QCD (1120 GeV \(<p_{T}<\) 2240 GeV) & 5.71 & \(0.434\pm 0.003\) & \(0.130\pm 0.002\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Calorimeter timing can be a powerful tool to remove fake \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) backgrounds from cosmic rays [13]. Timing in ATLAS is defined such that particles from the nominal interaction point (\(x=0\), \(y=0\), \(z=0\)) will arrive in the calorimeter cells at time \(t=0\). Cosmic ray events, however, will arrive at random times with no correlation to the LHC beam structure. One of the methods to reject cosmic rays is to calculate the "up-minus-down" time, in which one divides the TileCal into two segments, an upper segment, with \(\phi>0\) and a lower segment with \(\phi<0\), where \(\phi\) is the angle in the transverse plane. One then calculates the average time of cells in each segment, weighted by the energy of each cell \(i\):

\[t_{\rm up(down)}=\sum_{i}(E_{i}^{\rm up(down)}\times t_{i})/\sum_{i}E_{i}^{ \rm up(down)}. \tag{2}\]

The difference between the two quantities \(t_{\rm up}\) and \(t_{\rm down}\), should reflect the average time-of-flight. The resulting "up-minus-down" time should be centered at \(t=0\) for particles from the interaction point, as demonstrated in Fig. 5. In this figure, the "up-minus-down" time is calculated for a simulated Monte Carlo QCD dijet sample. As expected, the signal distribution peaks near zero. Note that the simulation includes electronic noise, and so the timing distribution has a spread of several ns.

Depending on their trajectory, cosmic ray muons traveling from the top to the bottom of ATLAS at near the speed of light will have a time-of-flight of typically 18-20 ns over their travel distance of approximately 6-7 m [14] in the TileCal. This is demonstrated in Fig. 5 for a simulated Monte Carlo sample of cosmic ray muons. In this case, the distribution peaks near -18 ns (the time of flight is negative as expected for a particle traveling from the top to the bottom). The width of the simulated distribution is 3 ns, allowing for a good separation of the background from the signal peaking at \(t=0\). Further details of calorimeter timing studies with cosmic rays in ATLAS can be found in Ref. [14].

## 3 Monte Carlo systematics

### Generator systematics: proton PDF and underlying event

In this section, uncertainties on the Monte Carlo generation of QCD events arising from proton parton distribution functions (PDFs) and modeling of the underlying event are briefly investigated. These uncertainties provide a limit to the precision with which the novel detector simulation strategies describedin Sections 4.1 and 4.2 can model QCD backgrounds to SUSY. Due to the large number of Monte Carlo samples required for this study, each with different PDF or underlying event parameters, it was unfeasible to work with GEANT4 detector simulation samples. Therefore dedicated samples of events were generated in the same \(p_{T}\) ranges as the GEANT4 samples used elsewhere in this note [8] and passed through the ATLAS fast detector simulation [15]. For all distributions shown in this section, QCD events were selected with the common jet cuts described in Section 1.

Proton Parton Distribution FunctionsAll calculations of cross-sections at the LHC rely on a knowledge of the proton parton distribution functions (PDFs). High-\(p_{T}\) QCD events will be particularly sensitive to the gluon PDF at large \(x\) which, in current global fits [16, 17, 18, 19], is relatively poorly known. In this section, the impact of the PDF uncertainties on distributions of observables sensitive to the presence of SUSY signal is estimated.

Events were generated using PYTHIA 6.403[7], with the following PDFs: CTEQ6L1 [20], CTEQ6.1M[17] and MRST2004nlo [21]. Note that CTEQ6L1 is a leading order (LO) PDF, while CTEQ6.1M and MRST2004nlo sets are both next-to-leading-order (NLO) sets. CTEQ6.1M provides a set of error PDFs (\(S_{i}^{\pm}\)), corresponding to the \(N\) eigenvector directions. Note that the \(S_{i}^{\pm}\) only reflect the experimental uncertainties on the data, and do not include any information on theoretical assumptions used in the fit. The total PDF uncertainty arising from experimental sources, on a given observable, \(\Sigma\), can then be constructed according to:

\[\Delta\Sigma^{\pm}=\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(\max\left(\pm\Sigma(S_{i}^{+})\mp \Sigma(S_{0}),\Sigma(\pm S_{i}^{-})\mp\Sigma(S_{0}),0\right)\right)^{2}}; \tag{3}\]

where \(\Delta\Sigma^{+}(\Delta\Sigma^{-})\) are the upper (lower) uncertainties on the observable and \(S_{0}\) represents the central (best fit) PDF value. For CTEQ6.1M, there are 40 error PDF sets, \(S_{i}^{\pm}\), corresponding to \(N=20\) eigenvector directions. Since the uncertainty band obtained from CTEQ6.1M only reflects the uncertainties of the experimental data, the predictions of this PDF are also compared here to those from MRST2004nlo (an

alternative, independent NLO PDF) and to CTEQ6L12).

Footnote 2): Note that the PYTHIA parameters used by default within ATLAS are tuned to the CTEQ6L1 proton PDF. Strictly, if a different PDF is used, a retuning of the Monte Carlo parameters to data should be performed. This has not been done in the current study, and this should be bourme in mind when interpreting the results.

The distribution of \(M_{\rm eff}\) for the different PDFs considered, and the fractional uncertainty with respect to the central prediction of CTEQ6.1M, is shown in Fig. 6. The CTEQ6.1M uncertainty band ranges from \(\sim 20-50\%\), as \(M_{\rm eff}\) increases. The largest contribution to this band comes from eigenvector 15, which is mainly sensitive to the gluon at large \(x\). The results from MRST2004nlo lie well within the CTEQ6.1M uncertainty band across the whole range of the distribution. The prediction from CTEQ6L1, a LO PDF, lies below those of the NLO PDFs. For \(M_{\rm eff}\gtrsim 1\) TeV, the difference is approximately constant and at the level of \(\sim 20\%\). The validity of using NLO versus LO PDFs, with LO matrix-element generators, is discussed in a recent publication [22]. However, these results indicate that the difference between the results from LO and NLO PDFs is smaller than the CTEQ6.1M uncertainty band.

Underlying EventMonte Carlo generation of QCD events is also sensitive to the underlying event. Multi-parton interactions are modelled in several Monte Carlo generators. For this study, the PYTHIA 6.403 [7], and HERWIG 6.507 [23] (used in conjunction with JIMMY v4 [24]) are used. Further details of the underlying-event models compared are summarised below. Note that, unless otherwise stated, CTEQ6L1 is used as the proton PDF.

The underlying event models considered are briefly summarised below:

* ATLAS default" : the ATLAS default underlying-event tune for PYTHIA 6.4[8].
* Tune A" : a model based on the "PYTHIA-TuneA" [25] to Tevatron data. Note that since underlying-event tunes also depend on the PDFs, CTEQ5L [26], appropriate to Tune A, has been used here.

Figure 7: The \(M_{\rm eff}\) distribution for simulated QCD events satisfying SUSY jet cuts described in Section 1. The left plot shows the number of events per bin and the right plot shows the fractional uncertainty with respect to the “PYTHIA - ATLAS default” model for the underlying event. In each plot, the solid histogram shows the results from the “PYTHIA – ATLAS default”, the dotted histogram shows “PYTHIA – Tune A”, the dashed histogram shows “PYTHIA – no MPI” and the dot-dashed histogram shows “JIMMY – ATLAS default”. The error bars reflect the Monte Carlo statistics.

- no MPI" : a model in which multi-parton interactions have been switched off. All other parameters were left at the PYTHIA 6.403 defaults. This model does not describe the Tevatron data, but is included for comparison.
* ATLAS default"
- the ATLAS default underlying event tune for HERWIG 6.5 + JIMMY 4 [8].

The distribution of \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is shown in Fig. 7. The left plot shows the number of events per bin (scaled to 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)) while the right plot shows the fractional ratio with respect to "PYTHIA - ATLAS default". As expected, the model with no underlying event contribution, "PYTHIA - no MPI", lies below the predictions of all other PYTHIA models. The highest model prediction is given by the "PYTHIA - Tune A" model, based on "PYTHIA-TuneA" to Tevatron data. The ATLAS default tunes, "PYTHIA - ATLAS default" and "JIMMY - ATLAS default", show differences of \(\sim 20\%\). However, some of this difference may come from the different normalisations of PYTHIA and HERWIG and not totally due to the underlying event model. The overall spread in predictions from these models, is \(\sim 40\%\) and is approximately constant across the range of \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) shown.

### Jet energy scale uncertainty

A significant source of irreducible experimental uncertainty in Monte Carlo QCD background estimates will arise from the uncertainty in the jet-energy-scale (JES). In this section, a simple estimate of the impact of the JES uncertainty is performed. For each event, the energy and momentum of each jet has been scaled by a constant factor, corresponding to a 10%, 5%, 3% and 1% uncertainty on the JES. The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) has also been adjusted accordingly, by an amount corresponding to the change in the sum of the jet momenta in the \(x\) and \(y\) directions. All such scaling is performed prior to any selection cuts. For this study, the QCD dijet events generated with PYTHIA have been used, with a fake \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) filter applied to enhance the rate of potentially mismeasured events [3, 8].

Figure 8 shows the resulting \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) distribution. The shaded bands show the uncertainties on the distribution for the four different values of the JES uncertainty considered. For a 10% value, the uncertainty

The left plot shows the number of events per bin and the right plot shows the fractional uncertainty with respect to the central prediction. The shaded bands show the estimated uncertainty on the observable for assumed JES uncertainties of 10% (light), 5% (medium-light), 3% (medium) and 1% (dark).

on the \(M_{\rm eff}\) distribution ranges from \(\sim 50-150\%\). An improved understanding of the JES to a level of 5% reduces the uncertainty on \(M_{\rm eff}\) by more than a factor of two, while a 3% value shows an improved uncertainty on \(M_{\rm eff}\) of between \(\sim 10-30\%\). If the challenging goal of a 1% JES uncertainty is achievable, the results indicate that the uncertainty on high-\(p_{\rm T}\) events could be much reduced, to a level of \(\sim 5-10\%\).

### Generator comparison: PS vs. ALPGEN

The recent development of event generators in which regions of phase-space populated by a multi-parton matrix-element calculation are matched to those populated by a parton shower algorithm offer the prospect of improved simulation of high \(p_{T}\) QCD jet events. In this section we compare the physics performance of such a generator, namely the leading-order ALPGEN[27] code, with that of a conventional stand-alone parton-shower generator (PYTHIA 6.403[7]).

Multijet QCD events were generated with ALPGEN 2.05+JIMMY and with PYTHIA 6.403 and the resulting distributions of observables sensitive to SUSY signal events compared using fast simulation [15]. PYTHIA events were generated in different \(p_{T}\) ranges of the two leading partons to study the high energy tails with sufficient statistics (see Ref. [8]). Such sliced-sample production is also possible in ALPGEN. Only events satisfying the standard SUSY jet cuts described in Section 1 were studied. The number of PYTHIA events passing the jet selection cuts is 2.1 times larger than the number of ALPGEN events for the same integrated luminosity3). To facilitate comparison of the two samples, they were both normalized

to 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\tt ALPGEN\) samples were further multiplied by a factor of 2.1. Error bars on each histogram below are based on the Monte Carlo statistics used in this study.

Footnote 1: The \(\tt ALPGEN\) and \(\tt ALPGEN\) distributions are used to calculate the \(\tt ALPGEN\) and \(\tt PYTHIA\) distributions.

Figure 9 shows the \(p_{T}\) distribution of the leading four jets for \(\tt ALPGEN\) and \(\tt PYTHIA\) events. The new parton shower scheme available in PYTHIA 6.403 can produce hard subleading jets with similar \(p_{T}\) to those produced by \(\tt ALPGEN\) while the two leading jets are somewhat softer. Even though \(\tt PYTHIA\) also generates \(2\to 2\) scattering using matrix-element calculations, the two highest-\(p_{T}\) jets are softer because additional partons are emitted from the leading partons using splitting functions.

The use of fast detector simulation for the comparison of event generators described in this section prevents accurate study of the impact of generator differences on 'fake' \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm\ miss}\) distributions. Nevertheless,'real' \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) events in which heavy quark decays generate neutrinos can potentially dominate in

the tail of the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distribution following application of the cuts described in Section 2 and Ref. [3]. Fast detector simulation can legitimately be used to study this background permitting comparison of PYTHIA and ALPGEN predictions of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and \(M_{\rm eff}\) distributions. Figure 10(a) shows the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distributions obtained from PYTHIA and ALPGEN while Figure 10(a) shows the relative difference between the distributions of the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\).

PYTHIA predicts somewhat larger \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) than ALPGEN, although limited Monte Carlo statistics prevent firm conclusions from being drawn at large \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\). This effect likely originates from the fact that multi-jet events containing gluon splitting are not fully included in ALPGEN because of the requirements of matrix element - parton shower matching. 4 The equivalent \(M_{\rm eff}\) distributions and the relative differences between generators are shown in Figure 11. The \(M_{\rm eff}\) distribution of ALPGEN events is harder than that of PYTHIA events, as expected from Figure 9(a) and (b).

Footnote 4: To avoid double counting of partons generated by the matrix element calculation and parton shower algorithm, the MLM matching scheme employed by ALPGEN requires that matrix element partons satisfy cuts on \(p_{T}\) (\(>\)40 GeV) and \(\Delta R\) between partons (\(>\) 0.7). As a result of these requirements, processes such as \(ggbb\) generating multiple partons with \(\Delta R_{bb}<\) 0.7 are rejected during matching. Events with gluon splitting generated in the parton shower algorithm are however kept.

## 4 Monte Carlo estimates

### Jet smearing with Transfer Function

IntroductionIn this section, a Monte Carlo based detector simulation technique is described which models the response function of the ATLAS calorimeter to jets as a function of energy and \(\eta\) using Monte Carlo "truth" information, and then uses this response function to smear the energies of jets and other objects in Monte Carlo QCD jet events. The truth-derived response function used here is referred to as the particle-jet transfer function (PJTF) and in principle may be measured also from data using techniques such as those described in Section 5.1.

Modeling jets - reconstruction of the PJTFIn this section we use the following terminology for two different types of jets formed from Monte Carlo events - "particle jets", made from all the generated particles in the event except muons and neutrinos, and "calorimeter jets" formed from topological clusters in the calorimeter.

In general there is a high efficiency for reconstructing jets in the calorimeter, even though their energy can potentially be mis-measured by a large amount. Jet fragmentation to particles of different types and the response of the detector material to these particles in different \(\eta\) regions can produce tails in the PJTF. It is possible for there not to be a one-to-one match between generator-level jets and calorimeter jets even though the same jet clustering algorithms are used.

To reconstruct the PJTF it is necessary to measure the response of the calorimeter to generator-level jets. This is accomplished by matching these to calorimeter jets, and requiring a good jet isolation in both jets (separation from nearest jet \(\Delta R>0.8\)), to ensure that accidental jet overlaps do not contribute to the tails in the PJTF. Jet energy responses are modeled with double Gaussians. The ratio of the 1st and 2nd Gaussian components is empirically known to follow the ratio of energy deposits in the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeter and hence the 1st/2nd Gaussian ratio is fixed to the mean value of \(E_{\rm had}/(E_{\rm em}+E_{\rm had})\) with a fitting procedure. GEANT4 simulated PYTHIA dijet samples with \(p_{T}>17\) GeV [8] are used to estimate the PJTF. Reconstructed jet energies are corrected with an energy-density based weighting scheme [28]. The fits are performed before the jet energy corrections have been applied, i.e. the PJTF is obtained at the calorimeter cell energy calibration level. To use the PJTF on reconstructed jets, cell-to-jet energy corrections are applied after the PJTF. For the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) calculation the cell-level correction is used directly to retain consistency with full GEANT4 simulation \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\).

**Modeling \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)** All truth jets (formed from stable truth particles expected to shower in the calorimeter) with energy greater than 10 GeV are smeared with the PJTF. This avoids double counting of interacting particles (electron, photon, tau) due to the potentially different treatment of merging and splitting of objects, for example when the photon is close to a jet. This simplification of reconstructing jets from all stable showering particles mis-measures the energy scale of isolated electrons, photons and taus by a small amount, however the ATLAS procedure of identifying and calibrating electromagnetic and hadronic showers separately ensures that the resulting bias is minimised. This study is additionally focussed on QCD jet events and hence any such bias is still less important. Muons in the event are simulated with the ATLFAST fast simulation code [15] due to the prohibitive time overhead associated with full simulation of the ATLAS tracking systems. Finally in order to account for the potentially large fluctuation in the underlying event, we vectorially sum all the particles that are not part of jets above 10 GeV to form a "soft jet". This soft jet is added to the above jet sum to compensate for the contribution from soft particles outside of the jet cones. Once all the objects in the event are defined, the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) in the event is calculated by summing their four-vectors, enabling comparison of the performance of the PJTF technique with full GEANT4 simulation.

PerformanceThe performance of the PJTF technique was assessed by comparing PJTF predictions with those obtained from full GEANT4 simulation using the \(p_{T}>17\) GeV dijet samples described above. The event-by-event comparison was performed using both ATLFAST and fully reconstructed objects in the GEANT4 simulation samples.

The jet multiplicity difference between full GEANT4 simulation and PJTF, and between full GEANT4 simulation and ATLFAST are shown in Fig. 12. Only jets with \(p_{T}>50\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) were used, but no event selection based on the jet multiplicity was performed.

There is good agreement in jet multiplicity between the full GEANT4 simulation and the PJTF events. The ATLFAST events have a somewhat higher multiplicity due to the simplified calorimeter map used for jet reconstruction. For the PJTF technique to be effective, it is important that the multiplicity at reconstruction level is not biased. This is clearly demonstrated in Fig. 12. Good agreement was found for jet \(p_{T}>40\) GeV, which can be explained as follows. The topological clustering jet algorithm has a \(\sim\)100% efficiency so if the transfer function is correctly scaling and smearing the energy the jet multiplicity could only be biased by jets splitting and/or merging.

Another performance check is the comparison of the scalar \(p_{T}\) sum of the four leading jets obtained from full GEANT4 simulation, PJTF, and ATLFAST events. Events passing the typical SUSY jet cuts listed in Section 1 are used. Fig. 13 shows the comparisons for 140 GeV \(<p_{T}<280\) GeV and 560 GeV \(<\)

Figure 12: Event by event difference in number of jets between full GEANT4 simulation and PJTF (blue,solid) and between full GEANT4 simulation and ATLFAST (red,dashed). The left plot is for 140 GeV \(<p_{T}<280\) GeV events, and the right one is for 560 GeV \(<p_{T}<\) 1120 GeV events.

\(p_{T}<1120\) GeV events. Good agreement is observed between the full GEANT4 simulation and PJTF events, while ATLFAST events have significant deviations for the same reasons as for Fig. 12.

In order to check the performance of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) modeling the typical SUSY jet cuts described in Section 1 were applied, with no \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) cut applied initially. We define fake \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) as follows:

\[E_{T}^{\mathrm{miss,fake}}=|\mathbf{p}_{T}^{\mathrm{miss,reco}}|-|\mathbf{p}_{ T}^{\mathrm{miss,true}}|\]

where \(\mathbf{p}_{T}^{\mathrm{miss,reco}}\) is the missing transverse momentum vector reconstructed using either the PJTF technique, GEANT4 simulation, or ATLFAST, and \(\mathbf{p}_{T}^{\mathrm{miss,true}}\) is the transverse vector of the sum of the neutrino momenta.

Fig. 14 shows the fake \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution obtained from the PJTF technique and from full GEANT4 simulation. Also shown are the ATLFAST results, and the PJTF results without the soft-jet corrections. It can be seen from the figure that \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) estimated with the PJTF technique and with full GEANT4 simulation agree at the 20% level for fake \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)\(<\) 80 GeV (200 GeV) for 140-280 GeV (560-1120 GeV) dijet events. The figures highlight the improvement in performance relative to the naive ATLFAST estimate of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), with the agreement between PJTF and full GEANT4 simulation persisting down into the tail region a factor \(10^{-3}\) below the peak.

Fig. 15 shows the performance of the PJTF technique for estimating QCD backgrounds to the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) distributions obtained following application of the SUSY jet cuts described in Section 1. In these plots the event-weights and errors are normalized to 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). Good agreement is seen between the PJTF distributions and the full simulation distributions over the full \(p_{T}\) range, while the naive ATLFAST distributions show larger deviations from the full simulation results.

Events were required to pass the SUSY jet cuts described in Section 1.

Additional cuts equivalent to the full SUSY cuts described in Section 1 were applied to assess further the consistency between the PJTF results and those obtained with full GEANT4 simulation. In Table 2 the remaining numbers of events after each stage in the event selection are shown. Cut 1 is the standard SUSY jet cut applied above. Cut 2 adds the requirement \(\Delta\phi_{min}>0.2\) (see Section 2.2) while Cut 3 requires additionally \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\,>\) max(100 GeV, \(0.2M_{\mathrm{eff}}\)) and \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}>800\) GeV. Despite limited statistics the results show that the PJTF approach provides reduced event selection bias in comparison with the naive ATLFAST simulation.

### Fast Geant4 simulation

IntroductionThe simulation of the ATLAS detector is currently based on GEANT4 v.4.8.3[2]. GEANT4 simulation is very time consuming however and so its use for QCD background simulation at moderate or low \(p_{T}\) is not viable. The fully GEANT4-based approach (refered to as full simulation in the following) is especially slow in the simulation of electromagnetic cascades in the calorimeters due to their complicated geometry. A fast simulation tool (ATLFAST[15]) based on Gaussian smearing is also available, and is used for studies of systematic uncertainties elsewhere in this note, but it does not reproduce with sufficient accuracy the tails of distributions interesting for SUSY analysis, i.e. \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\,\) or \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\). For this reason, an intermediate approach to the simulation of the ATLAS detector, based on the parameterisation of the calorimeters' response, is under study [29]. In the so-called 'fast' GEANT4 simulation, electrons entering the calorimeters may receive different treatments according to their energy. For high energy particles a shower parameterisation is used while for medium energy particles (below 1 GeV) the detector response is taken from a shower library ("frozen showers"), and low energy particles (below 10 MeV) are "killed" by depositing their energy in a single spot in the calorimeter.

PerformanceWe tested fast GEANT4 simulation algorithms by simulating PYTHIA[7] dijet events with moderate transverse momentum (280 GeV \(<p_{T}<\) 560 GeV). The fast GEANT4 simulation can be performed using different options, which differ in the treatment applied to electromagnetic particles (shower parameterization, frozen showers or "killing") in different parts of the calorimeters (for more details, see [29]). In the following, the fast GEANT4 options are numbered from 1 to 3, the first one being the most conservative option, i.e., the closest to full simulation, and the third one the fastest option currently available. The measured fast GEANT4 simulation time is \(\sim\)60% lower than that required for full simulation. The three fast GEANT4 options differ among themselves by only a few percent of the full simulation time. To study the effect of the fast GEANT4 simulation algorithms in SUSY searches, we compared the distributions of typical quantities, i.e. the jet multiplicity and transverse momentum, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\,\), transverse sphericity, and effective mass in 5000 fast GEANT4 simulated events with the ones obtained from full simulation (see Figs. 16, 17 and 18). We reconstructed jets with \(p_{T}>\) 50 GeV and \(|\eta|<\) 2.5. Due to the limited number of Monte Carlo events, no requirement was applied to the jet multiplicity, except in the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\,\) and \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) distributions, where the standard SUSY jet cuts described in Section 1 were applied.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline Method & Cut 1 & Cut 2 & Cut 3 \\ \hline Full simulation & \((103.8\pm 0.3)\times 10^{3}\) & \((65.7\pm 0.3)\times 10^{3}\) & \(4.3\pm 2.1\) \\ PJTF technique & \((104.9\pm 0.3)\times 10^{3}\) & \((62.3\pm 0.2)\times 10^{3}\) & \(2.2\pm 1.5\) \\ ATLFAST & \((120.0\pm 0.3)\times 10^{3}\) & \((86.1\pm 0.3)\times 10^{3}\) & \(2.1\pm 1.5\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Transverse sphericity and effective mass quantities were calculated only for events with at least 2 jets.

Whilst the largest jet transverse momentum is well reproduced in the fast simulated samples, the average jet multiplicity is lower than that of the fully simulated sample by 1-2%. The most conservative sample (option 1) is in agreement with the full simulation distribution inside the statistical uncertainty. The width of the jet \(p_{T}\) resolution is consistent across the samples, however the jet energy scale is too low by 1-2% (see Fig. 17). Due to the limited number of events available only a qualitative comparison is possible in regions of interest for SUSY searches for \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) (higher than 100 GeV) and transverse sphericity (larger than 0.2). Within the statistical precision possible the fast simulated distributions agree well with those obtained from full GEANT4 simulation. The size of the available samples preclude a full assessment of performance for the baseline SUSY cuts described in the introduction, since no events pass all cuts when using any of the three options. Similarly, from an equivalent number of GEANT4-simulated events, none pass all the cuts.

Overall, the fast GEANT4 simulation has been shown to be a promising faster alternative to the full GEANT4 based simulation. The reconstructed quantities in fast GEANT4 simulated samples are in good agreement with full simulation. Work is on-going to further reduce the simulation time, and to improve the modeling of the jet energy scale.

## 5 Data-driven estimates

### Jet smearing in the zero-lepton mode

IntroductionThe inherent systematic and statistical uncertainties in Monte Carlo based QCD background estimates will limit their use until sufficient data have been acquired to understand both the ATLAS detector and the underlying physics of QCD processes at 14 TeV. For this reason data-driven background estimates with minimal reliance on Monte Carlo simulation will be a priority for the early phase of data-taking.

The method described in this section reduces dependence on Monte Carlo simulation by smearing jet transverse momenta in low \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) QCD multijet data with a data-measured jet response function \(R\) defined as the distribution of event-by-event ratios of measured jet \(p_{T}\) to true jet \(p_{T}\). This response function could potentially be used inter-changeably with the Monte Carlo-truth derived Particle Jet Transfer Function (PJTF) discussed in Section 4.1. Consequently the method described below provides a route to practical realisation of the PJTF technique for use with real data. The technique can be broken down into three distinct parts which are outlined below.

Step 1: Gaussian response function measurementThe "\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) projection method" [30] applied to \(\gamma\) + jet events allows a measurement of the Gaussian response \(R^{G}\) of the ATLAS calorimeters to jets. The limited number of events prevent the measurement of the non-Gaussian tail with this technique (see Step 2). The method uses transverse momentum conservation to constrain the \(p_{T}\) of all activity associated with a reconstructed jet with the \(p_{T}\) of a hard photon. \(R^{G}\) is obtained from the distribution of the photon-jet \(p_{T}\) balance \(R_{1}\):

\[R_{1}=1+\frac{\mathbf{p}_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}\cdot\mathbf{p}_{T}(\gamma)}{| \mathbf{p}_{T}(\gamma)|^{2}}, \tag{4}\]

where \(\mathbf{p}_{T}(\gamma)\) is the photon transverse momentum, and \(\mathbf{p}_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is the missing-transverse-momentum two-vector.

A GEANT4-simulated PYTHIA[7] sample equivalent to \(23.8\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) of \(\gamma\) + jets events was used, with events required to pass a 60 GeV single-photon trigger [9]. With the additional requirement that events should contain one and only one reconstructed jet, the jet response was measured with the distribution of \(R_{1}\) values defined above. The \(R_{1}\) distribution was measured in a number of photon \(p_{T}\) bins, and each was fitted with a Gaussian function. The standard deviations from these fits to the response distributions

are shown in Fig. 19 with the statistical error bars derived from the fit errors. The \(p_{T}\) dependence of the widths of the \(R_{1}\) distributions was fitted with the parametric form

\[\sigma_{R}=A+\frac{B}{\sqrt{p_{T}}}+\frac{C}{p_{T}}\, \tag{5}\]

shown in the figure to describe well the GEANT4 simulated data. The sampling (\(A\)) and stochastic (\(B\)) terms in the above formula were used to calculate the width of \(R^{G}\) as a function of jet \(p_{T}\), while the constant term (\(C\)) was used to estimate the additional smearing of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) not associated with jets (see Step 3 below).

Step 2: Full (Gaussian + non-Gaussian) response function measurementIn order to reproduce the tail of the QCD multijet \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distribution it is necessary to characterise the non-Gaussian response of the calorimeters to jets. The next stage in the technique therefore uses events in which the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) vector can be unambiguously associated in \(\phi\) with a single jet \(J\) to measure that response. The response of the ATLAS calorimeters to jet \(J\) if its \(p_{T}\) lies in the non-Gaussian tail can be obtained from

\[R_{2}=\frac{{\bf p}_{T}(J)\cdot{\bf p}_{T}(J,{\rm true})}{|{\bf p}_{T}(J,{\rm true })|^{2}}\, \tag{6}\]

where \({\bf p}_{T}(J)\) denotes the reconstructed transverse momentum of jet \(J\). If it is assumed that the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) in these events is dominated by fluctuations in \({\bf p}_{T}(J)\) then \({\bf p}_{T}(J,{\rm true})\) can be approximated by

\[{\bf p}_{T}(J,{\rm true})\simeq{\bf p}_{T}(J)+{\bf p}_{T}^{\rm miss}. \tag{7}\]

The non-Gaussian response of ATLAS, \(R^{NG}\), is measured with the distribution of event \(R_{2}\) values.

QCD jet events from the sample described in Section 2.1 were required to pass one of the high-\(p_{T}\) multijet or \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) triggers [9], and required to contain at least three jets with \(p_{T}>250\), 50 and 25 GeV, respectively. Events were also required to possess \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)\(>60\) GeV. Events were further required to contain a jet unambiguously associated with the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) vector - i.e. events with one and only one jet parallel or anti-parallel to the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) vector. Of the remaining jets in each event, the two with the highest \(p_{T}\) were required to have \(p_{T}>250\), 50 GeV. In this way, the selected events predominantly had a 'Mercedes' type configuration, with \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) parallel or anti-parallel to the \(p_{T}\) of one of the jets. The

Figure 19: Standard deviations of Gaussian fits to measured response distributions vs. \(p_{T}^{\gamma}\). The fit is of the functional form \(\sigma_{R}(p_{T})=A+Bp_{T}{}^{-1/2}+Cp_{T}{}^{-1}\).

\(p_{T}\) of this jet was used in Eqn. 6 to measure \(R_{2}\). The estimate of the jet response non-Gaussian tail \(R^{NG}\) obtained from the distribution of \(R_{2}\) values is plotted as the histogram in Fig. 20(right) with a normalisation obtained with the procedure described below. Although not considered in detail here, the \(W(\rightarrow\tau\nu)+2\) jet background could have been removed with a cut on the multiplicity of inner detector tracks per jet.

Next we combine the Gaussian and non-Gaussian components of the jet response \(R\) measured previously. The relative normalisation of the Gaussian (\(R^{G}\)) and non-Gaussian (\(R^{NG}\)) components can be measured using the balance of transverse momenta of jets in dijet events. The relative normalisation can be obtained from the ratio of the numbers of dijet events with respectively one and zero jets with \(p_{T}\) lying in the non-Gaussian tail of the jet response function. We therefore need to define a variable which can classify dijet events according to the number of jets with \(p_{T}\) lying in the non-Gaussian tail. A suitable variable is provided by \(R_{3}(j)\), defined as the projection of the transverse momentum of each jet \(j^{\prime}\) in the event onto the event \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) :

\[R_{3}(j)=1+\frac{\mathbf{p}_{T}^{\rm miss}\cdot\mathbf{p}_{T}(j^{\prime})}{| \mathbf{p}_{T}(j^{\prime})|^{2}}, \tag{8}\]

which measures the response to the other jet \(j\) in the event (cf. Eqn. 4). If \(R_{3}(j)\) lies below some threshold then jet \(j\) can be considered to lie in the non-Gaussian tail.

Events were selected from the QCD jet event sample used above with the requirement that they passed a 160 GeV single-jet trigger requirement [9] and contained two and only two jets, back-to-back in the transverse plane. The distribution of \(R_{3}(j)\) for these events is plotted as data-points in Fig. 20(right). The ratio of the integral of the low tail of the \(R_{3}(j)\) distribution to the integral of a Gaussian function fitted to the peak is used to obtain the relative normalisation of the non-Gaussian and Gaussian components of the jet response function. The full jet response function including normalised Gaussian and non-Gaussian components is plotted in Fig. 20 (left).

As a 'closure test' of the reconstruction of the full response function, jets in a subset of the selected

Right – dijet balance distribution (points) compared with the equivalent estimated distribution obtained from the jet response function to provide a ‘closure test’ of the technique. Also shown are a Gaussian fit to the region \(0.8<R_{3}(j)<1.15\) (thick line), and the non-Gaussian tail distribution (dashed histogram) measured with ‘Mercedes’ events normalised to the tail of the dijet balance distribution.

dijet events with low \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) - significance (see Section 2.1) were smeared to reproduce the \(R_{3}(j)\) distribution. The resulting distribution is shown in Fig. 20 (right) for comparison with 'data'.

Step 3: Seed event selection and jet \(p_{T}\) smearingIn order to estimate the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and \(M_{\rm eff}\) distributions of QCD multijet events the jet response function \(R\) measured in Step 2 was used to smear jet transverse momenta in multijet events with low \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) (referred to below as'seed events'). Seed events were selected from the same PYTHIA jet sample used in Step 2. Seed event candidates were required to pass one of the ATLAS high-\(p_{T}\) jet triggers [9] together with the standard SUSY jet selection cuts described in Section 1 with a reduced jet \(p_{T}\) threshold (\(p_{T}(j_{i})>45\) GeV for \(i=2,3,4\)) in order to avoid biasing the final estimate after smearing. Both the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) significance (see Section 2.1) and the equivalent quantity constructed from \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) derived only from in-cone jet energy were required to be less than 0.5 GeV\({}^{1/2}\) and 0.7 GeV\({}^{1/2}\), respectively. The latter of these two cuts ensures that the hadronic activity in the selected seed events is well contained in the jets that will be smeared.

Smeared events were constructed from each selected seed event by smearing the transverse momenta of their constituent jets with the jet response function \(R\) determined in Step 2. The \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) of smeared events was calculated by replacing the contribution to the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) from the \(p_{T}\) of seed jets with a contribution from the \(p_{T}\) of the equivalent smeared jets. An additional contribution \({\bf p}_{T,{\rm C}}^{\rm miss}\) to \({\bf p}_{T}^{\rm miss}\) generated by the constant term measured in Step 1 was also taken into account. The smeared \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) was therefore given by the magnitude of

\[{\bf p}_{T}^{\rm miss}{}^{\prime}={\bf p}_{T,{\rm C}}^{\rm miss}-\sum_{i}{\bf p }_{T}^{\prime}(j_{i})+\sum_{i}{\bf p}_{T}(j_{i}), \tag{9}\]

where primed quantities are smeared.

Fig. 21 shows the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and \(M_{\rm eff}\) distributions for 23.8pb\({}^{-1}\) of GEANT4 simulated 'data' and smeared seed events passing the SUSY jet cuts listed in Section 1. The estimate was normalised to GEANT4 simulated PYTHIA QCD jet events ('data') with \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}<50\) GeV and somewhat tighter jet cuts (\(p_{T}(j_{4})>60\) GeV) imposed to ensure a reasonable sample of 'data' events obtained with the multi-jet triggers [9].

The dominant sources of systematic uncertainty in the estimate were \(p_{T}\) bias in the selection of events and finite statistics in the non-Gaussian tail measurement. Uncertainties on the \(A\), \(B\), and \(C\) parameters in

Lepton isolation versus \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) for \(b\bar{b}\) + jetsThe dependence of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) on lepton (e,\(\mu\)) isolation was studied with a sample of \(b\bar{b}+\mathrm{jets}\) events generated with ALPGEN[27], corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about 200 pb\({}^{-1}\). At the event generator level, one of the \(b\) quarks was forced to undergo semileptonic decay to \(e\) or \(\mu\); also applied at the event generator level were filters requiring true \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)\(>\) 30 GeV, four or more truth jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>\) 40 GeV, a leading truth jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>\) 80 GeV and truth lepton with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>\) 10 GeV. In the offline analysis, the events were required to satisfy the SUSY jet cuts described in Section 1. The events were required to have one and only one lepton with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) greater than 20 GeV, where the lepton could be either an electron or muon. Events with additional leptons (with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>\)10 GeV) were rejected.

A (non-isolated) control sample was defined by the requirement \(E_{T}^{\mathrm{cone}}=[10,20]\) GeV, where \(E_{T}^{\mathrm{cone}}\) is the \(E_{T}\) inside an \(\eta-\phi\) cone of radius 0.2 centered around the lepton, excluding the lepton \(p_{T}\). The (isolated) signal sample was defined as \(E_{T}^{\mathrm{cone}}\)\(<\) 10 GeV. The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution of the control sample was normalized in the region \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}=[10,20]\) GeV to the signal sample. This normalized \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution was used to estimate the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution for isolated leptons. Fig. 22 shows the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution for the isolated and non-isolated samples. The agreement is good, suggesting that the correlation between \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and lepton isolation in \(b\bar{b}+\mathrm{jets}\) events is small.

It is also apparent from Fig. 22 that the absolute level of background is low, even though typical SUSY selection cuts on \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), transverse mass and effective mass (typically \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)\(>\) 100 GeV, \(M_{T}\)\(>\) 100 GeV, and \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\)\(>\) 800 GeV) have not yet been applied. We will return to this point later. The \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\) distribution after the jet and lepton selection cuts is shown in Fig. 23(left). Ideally, one would like to demonstrate that the lack of correlation between lepton isolation and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) still holds even after the other SUSY selection cuts, such as those on \(M_{T}\) and \(M_{\mathrm{eff}}\), have been applied. This was not possible in this study with fully simulated data due to the limited number of events available.

Contamination from \(W\) + jets and \(t\bar{t}\)An important systematic effect comes from the contamination of the control samples by \(W+\mathrm{jets}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) events. This was studied with fast simulation samples which had no generator-level cuts. The sample sizes corresponded to integrated luminosities of approximately 200 pb\({}^{-1}\), 6 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 3 fb\({}^{-1}\) for \(b\bar{b}+\mathrm{jets}\), \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+\mathrm{jets}\), respectively. The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution, after the event

The two distributions have been normalized to the same area in the region \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}=[10,20]\) GeV.

selection cuts described above is shown in Fig. 23(right) for the \(b\bar{b}\), \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+\mathrm{jets}\) samples for isolated and non-isolated muons defined as above. Looking first just at the \(b\bar{b}\) events, there is good agreement in the shape of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution for the isolated and non-isolated samples; this reinforces the findings from the GEANT4-simulated \(b\bar{b}+\mathrm{jets}\) samples on the independence of muon isolation and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). It is also clear that the non-isolated sample is dominated by \(b\bar{b}\) at low \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). However, the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) tail is dominated by \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+\mathrm{jets}\) events, even in the non-isolated sample.5 This implies that the shape of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution in the control sample will be distorted by the high \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) tail. It is possible to increase the number of \(b\bar{b}\) events in the control sample by further loosening the isolation requirement, however this has the disadvantage of extrapolating into the isolated signal region over a large range, which could be susceptible to correlations between isolation and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). Furthermore, even if the isolation requirement in the control sample were successfully loosened, there is the problem of normalization. In the isolated sample, \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+\mathrm{jets}\) completely dominate, even at very low \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) ; this means that the normalization of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution will be distorted when extrapolating from the control to the signal region.

Footnote 5: As an added complication the shape of this tail will change after the application of the \(M_{T}\) cut which selects primarily dileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) decays.

One might consider correcting the event yields in the control regions for the presence of \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+\mathrm{jets}\) events. An early CDF \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section analysis from Run2 [31] made corrections based on an assumed \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section. D0 [32] used the so-called "matrix method" where additional input on the efficiency for \(t\bar{t}\) and \(b\bar{b}\) events to pass the isolation cuts was used to extract the multijet background. The utility of these methods for the SUSY search could be further studied.

Despite the limitations of the technique in the presence of \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+\mathrm{jets}\) events background it should be noted that this study also indicates that QCD backgrounds are unlikely to be dominant in the 1-lepton channel. Even with application of just the standard SUSY 4-jet and lepton selection cuts, the QCD multijet background in the 1-lepton channel is significantly smaller than the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+\mathrm{jets}\) backgrounds and applying the remaining SUSY selection cuts further suppresses the QCD multijet background. Consequently in the baseline analysis the accuracy of QCD multijet background estimates is less important than that of the estimates other backgrounds described in Ref. [4]. It should be kept in mind however that for some background studies the jet or lepton selection cuts may be further loosened, in which case the the lepton isolation technique might be applicable without the problem of contamination from other backgrounds.

Right: \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions for \(t\bar{t}\) isolated muon sample (black filled circle), \(t\bar{t}\) non-isolated muon sample (red filled square), \(W+\mathrm{jets}\) isolated muon sample (black open circle), \(W+\mathrm{jets}\) non-isolated muon sample (black open square), \(b\bar{b}\) isolated muon sample (blue open triangle), \(b\bar{b}\) non-isolated muon sample (magenta filled triangle).

Upper limit on \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distribution for \(b\bar{b}\) + jetsIf the multijet background is large compared to the background from \(t\bar{t}\) (either because the existing Monte Carlo simulation happens to underestimate the contribution or because the selection cuts were further loosened), then issues of \(t\bar{t}\) contamination will become negligible and the methods described in the previous sections should work well to estimate the multijet background. On the other hand, if the multijet background is small compared to \(t\bar{t}\) as expected, one can obtain the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distribution from the control region (\(E_{T}^{\rm cone}=[10,20]\) GeV) as an upper limit on the multijet background; the (reasonable) assumption here (confirmed in Monte Carlo) is that the \(E_{T}^{\rm cone}\) distribution for multijet background is flat (or falling) as \(E_{T}^{\rm cone}\) approaches zero. After the \(M_{T}\) cut, this control region is expected to be dominated by \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+{\rm jets}\) events containing non-isolated leptons with the QCD multijet contribution playing only a very small role. Thus this will be an upper limit on the multijet background, but the number of events so obtained will in any case be many fewer than from the main \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+{\rm jets}\) backgrounds (with isolated leptons) and so are likely to be negligible.

The contribution from \(b\bar{b}+{\rm jets}\) has been compared to GEANT4-simulated ALPGEN\(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+{\rm jets}\) samples (corresponding to integrated luminosities of about 3 fb\({}^{-1}\)). In addition to the event selection cuts listed above (jet and lepton selection), the events were required to have \(M_{T}>100\) GeV and \(M_{\rm eff}>800\) GeV. The \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) distribution for the sum of \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+{\rm jets}\) samples for events with non-isolated (\(E_{T}^{\rm cone}=[10,20]\) GeV) leptons is shown in Fig. 24; the contribution of \(b\bar{b}+{\rm jets}\) cannot be seen compared to that from \(t\bar{t}\) plus \(W+{\rm jets}\). Furthermore, all contributions are negligible compared to the \(t\bar{t}\) plus \(W+{\rm jets}\) background with isolated leptons. Counting the number of non-isolated \(t\bar{t}\) plus \(W+{\rm jets}\) with \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>100\) (200) GeV, one would find an upper limit on the multijet background in the lepton channel of \(10\pm 2\) (\(5\pm 1\)) events for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). The true number of multijet background events would be estimated to be roughly an order of magnitude lower.

## 6 Summary

This paper has examined a wide range of techniques for estimating QCD backgrounds in searches for Supersymmetry at ATLAS. The focus of the paper has been on outlining the strategies which could be used and assessing the likely uncertainties associated with them. It is important to note that only by comparing uncorrelated results from a number of such independent techniques can a robust QCD background estimate be obtained.

Given the difficulty of obtaining accurate estimates of QCD jet backgrounds generating fake \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) it will be essential to reduce this source of background using the techniques described in Section 2 and also the more general cuts described in Ref. [3]. The remaining backgrounds can be estimated using Monte Carlo (Section 3 and 4) or data-driven (Section 5) techniques.

All Monte Carlo based estimates will be subject to systematic effects arising from parton distribution and underlying event uncertainties (Section 3.1), likely to be of order 20% in each case for events satisfying the baseline SUSY cuts described in Ref. [5]. A jet energy scale uncertainty of 5% (Section 3.2) will contribute a further \(\sim\) 30%. While the precision with which Monte Carlo generators model QCD jet physics at 14 TeV is difficult to assess prior to data-taking, the difference (Section 3.3) between a 'traditional' parton shower dijet estimate and that obtained from one of the newer matched matrix-element + parton-shower generators for the baseline SUSY cut set is of order 50% if an accurate normalisation to data can be obtained. To these effects must be added luminosity uncertainties ranging from 20-30% at start-up (from machine parameters) reducing to \(<\)3-5% (from total cross-section measurements and \(W\)/\(Z\) counting).

In addition to the above systematic effects, Monte Carlo simulation-based estimates will be subject to detector simulation uncertainties - due to the imperfect description of the response of ATLAS to QCD jets, and statistical uncertainties caused by the large QCD cross-section and access to finite computing resources. It is impossible to assess the accuracy of current full (GEANT4) or fast (ATLFAST, 'fast G4'-Section 4.2 or PJTF-Section 4.1) detector simulations without recourse to data, however the results of Section 4.1 suggest that uncertainties \(\sim\) 100% in the understanding of the response of the ATLAS calorimeters to jets may lead to similar uncertainties in the background estimate.

Data-driven background estimates have the advantage that they are less prone to input systematics, and can in some cases benefit from large statistics in control channels used to measure detector performance. However, additional systematic uncertainties have to be considered due to the potential contamination of control samples with non-QCD events, and from relying on Monte Carlo simulation to extrapolate from the control into the signal region. The data-driven estimate for the jets + \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) + 0-leptons channel described in Section 5.1 could potentially give a combined uncertainty of \(\lesssim\) 60% for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity and the baseline SUSY cut set, although a precise figure is difficult to obtain without further Monte Carlo data. In the jets + \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) + 1-lepton channel the QCD jet background is potentially far less significant, in which case the technique described in Section 5.2 is likely to generate a very conservative upper limit on the background a factor \(\sim\)10 above the true background for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\).
