## 1 Introduction

A study of TRT pattern recognition capability in the stand-alone mode with the DICE simulation is presented. Efficiencies and fake track finding probabilities for single muons and electrons are studied as function of the pile up for the barrel in ATLAS2 geometry. New approach for the global pattern recognition method is applied [1]. 'l'his allows to compare it with the other one[2] and thus to check consistency and possible biases, and to provide a nessesary flexibility in algorithm choice for future. Left-right ambiguity for the TRT hits is solved during the track pattern recognition(TPR). To check the quality of the TPR the final helix fit for accepted hits is applied.

## 2 Method of the global pattern recognition.

This method was originally developed for reconstruction of events with charmed particles decays in the EHS experiments at CERN, where it showed very high reliability.

In the simplest case, when track can be approximated by a straight line, our method comprised the following steps:1. Searching among all measured points for the subset of points including maximal number of measurements, which satisfy the next inequalities \[|aX_{i}+b-Y_{i}|<\epsilon_{i}\] Here \((X_{i},Y_{i})\) - track coordinates, (a,b) - straight line parameters, \(\epsilon_{i}\) - measurement errors.
2. Removing measurements of found track from the total sample of measurements.
3. Repeating the procedure with the rest of measurements.

Note that reconstruction of the verticies can be treated in the same manner. It becomes obvious if to take in account that the condition for a track to be linked with a vertex could be written in the same form:

\[|A_{i}x+B_{i}-y|<\delta_{i}\]

where \((A_{i},B_{i})\) - parameters of tracks found, (x,y) - vertex coordinate.

In other words, recognizer step by step finds the "longest" track among rest of measurements ( or vertex with maximal multiplicity ).

So, the task of track recognition is considered as task of search in set of inequalities for subsets which have the solution (and any such subset in principle can be accepted as set of measurements of some track). For each step the maximal power subset is searched ( it corresponds to track with the maximal number of measurements ), and then the procedure is repeated for the rest of measurements, while subset having the solution exists. Now we consider only sets of inequalities with linear dependence on the unknown paramerers, and one of our goal today is to estimate limits of implementation of this approch. Global method by definition requires an analitic description for dependence of measurements from unknown parameters ( linear, in our case ), and we can expect, for example, the better result of recognition of muons, then one for electrons because of bremsstrahlung.

Approch described is universal and may be used for various ATLAS detectors, and TRT one ( essentially endcup ) is the most complicated from them. But this approach permits the data with different parts of ATLAS detector be treated similtaniously, e.g. provide the search for tracks in the whole detector, not in separated, parts and, consequently, to provide much more reliable recognition of complicated events.

It is not obvious, that the linear approach will work satisfactory for all tracks, as it is for tracks of primary vertex with high momenta. Expansion of existing package for non-linear case may be done easily, whith permits to recognise tracks of secondary verticies and tracks with low momenta.

## 3 Data treatment

Data with ATLAS INDET simulation using the DICE for single electrons and muons with \(P_{t}=20\)GeV and all \(\eta\) were used. Pile-up was added from minibias events which were generated with GENCL program.

For the TPR the following parameters were generally selected:

* For barrel the region \(|\eta|<0.65\) was considered. These requirements were chosen for selection of the approximately the same number of hits.
* Road=300 \(\mu\) for drift time counts.
* Number of points for accepted track, NP, should be not less than 20.
* Value of cut for \(P_{t}\) ( \(Pt_{cut}\) ) to select track with transverse momentum higher then this value. For muons we setted \(Pt_{cut}\)=20 GeV. To check the bremsstrahlung influence different \(Pt_{cut}\) values for electron were applied.

## 4 Results of the TPR

To understand the pattern recognition quality the muon TPR without pile-up with \(P_{t}\)=20 GeV was studied as simplest case. Fig. 1 shows the distribution of input points for TRT, the distributrion of the dropped ones by the TPR procedure and the distribution of accepted points, respectively. As one can see the average number of dropped points is around 4 but the small tail with large number of dropped points exists due to muon electromagnetic interactions. Results of the final helix fit for accepted muon tracks are shown in Fig. 2, 3 and 4 (RMS, momentum and angle resolutions for the fit). Fig. 5shows "apparatus" function of the TPR for muons for \(Pt_{cut}\)=20 GeV. It seems that it is rather sharp.

To understand bremsstrahlung effects the TPR procedure was applied for electrons without pile-up with different ptcut values. It was found that \(Pt_{cut}\)=2 GeV accepts almost all electrons (99.4% efficiency). About 10% of events have 2 or 3 accepted tracks. For those highest momentum track was selected. Distributions for input, dropped and accepted points are shown in Fig. 6. Large tail due to bremsstrahlung is seen for input and dropped points. It is very suprising that the average number of accepted points is approximately the same as for muons (see Fig. 1). RMS, momentum and angle distributions after helix fit are presented in Fig. 7, 8 and 9, respectively. The average RMS for this case is the same as for muons. Bremsstrahlung tails for momentum and angle resolutions are obviously seen. The correspondent inefficiency as function of \(Pt_{cut}\) / \(Pt_{t}\) can be estimated from Fig. 10, where the "apparatus" function for that case is shown.

Results of the TPR without pile-up are summarized on Fig. 11. For \(Pt_{cut}\)=15 GeV the road=500 \(\mu\) was chosen.

Then the TPR procedure was applied for electrons and muons with pile-up. The \(Pt_{cut}\)=10 and 20 GeV values were chosen. Correspondent efficiencies and fake track finding frequencies are shown in Fig. 12. The following features can be drawn from this figure:

* Efficiency of this TPR approach is quite high.
* Electron inefficiency due to bremsstrahlung is much higher than TPR one.
* For high pile-up values the "saturation effect" is obsrved which means that fake track finding frequency becomes independent of \(Pt_{cut}\).

The values obtained for fake tracks are compatible with previous one shown in the ATLAS LOI.

Note that all these statements are not provided statistically. High pile-ups take a lot of CPU time for digitizations. More than 10 times powerful computer than IBM is needed to estimate these values with high enough precision ( about 1000 events).
