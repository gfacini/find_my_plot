It is summarized here the actual knowledge of the geometry of the readout cells, for a barrel module of the Tile calorimeter. In particular this case applies to the MODULE 0 construction.

In \(\phi\) the readout cell will be naturally projective because of the wedge structure of the modules. Each module covers \(\Delta\phi\sim\)0.1. In \(\eta\) the module will have just pseudo projectivity. This is done by ganging together in the same PMT readout bundle, fibers coming from different scintillators and related to the same longitudinal sampling. The cells are shown in Fig. 1. There are a total of 3 independent longitudinal samplings, labelled A, BC and D, as can be seen in Fig. 2.

The granularity is \(\Delta\eta\sim\)0.1 in the two inner samplings and \(\Delta\eta\sim\)0.2 in the outer sampling D. The thickness of the samplings is approximately 1.5, 4.2 and 1.9 interaction lengths, for A, BC and D respectively. The BC sampling is internally divided in two sections, B and C, as can be seen in Fig. 1, to give more pseudoprojectivity, but all the BC fibers join together in the same PMT.

In the initial phase only half of the MODULE 0 is instrumented with tiles, fibers and PMT's. The instrumented side is the side that is referred as the negative \(\eta\) region in this note. The cells are labelled with the letter of the respective sampling/subsampling plus a number that grows with \(|\eta|\). The cell numbers are counted from the center at \(\eta\)=0. For future use, a N or a P should be added as prefix, for Negative and Positive \(\eta\) respectively.

The barrel MODULE 0 is made of 19 submodules. The first submodule is a special one and is 306.4 mm long. This submodule is located in one of the extremities of the module, and it is in the instrumented region. This special module is followed by 18 standard submodules 293.2 mm long each one.

The positions of the submodules take into account the various types of submodules and the design gaps in between, and are taken from drawings T305390, T305426 and T305385 of the official tile CADD disk.

The total amount of PMT's for 1 module is 46 on each side, 92 in total, 5888 for the whole barrel cylinder.

By convention, the PMT holes are counted from the center of the girder. A hole of side 1 alternates with a hole of side 2. In half module, 24 holes are on the side 1 (top) and are labelled with even numbers, and 24 are on the side 2 (bottom) labelled with odd numbers. Two holes, one in each side, are empty. The numbering is sequential from 1 to 48. As numbering convention: PMT-1 BN-00 means PMT 1 barrel calorimeter negative eta module number 0, PMT-5-EP-05 means PMT 5 extended barrel postive eta module number 5. This way all readout PMT's are identified in a unique way.

### Sampling A

Sampling A is the the most inner sample of TILECAL. The average radius of this sampling is R=2445 mm. This sampling groups the three smallest scintillators, usually labelled 1 as tiles 1, 2 and 3. Scintillator tiles 1 and 3 are read out by the same fiber, and the other fiber reads only tile number 2.

Footnote 1: The sequential numbering following the tile size, from 1 (smallest) to 11 (largest) is used in this note because it is commonly used by almost everybody. In drawing T305364 it corresponds to the sequence 1, 7, 2, 8, 3, 9, 4, 10, 5, 11, 6.

Table 1 shows, for each \(\eta\) line, the Z coordinate relative to the center of the module, the Z coordinate with respect to the left side (abs.), and the

position of the fiber inside a submodule (submodule number and half period number). The half period shown in the table belongs always to the cell that starts at the \(\eta\) line and finishes at \(\eta\) + 0.1.

The total number of readout cells per module for this sampling is 40. The cells in the negative \(\eta\) half-side are labelled 2 A1 to A10, starting from the center of the module.

Footnote 2: They are labelled NA1 to NA10, but in this note the short form A1 to A10 will be used, since the cells of the positive \(\eta\) side are not described.

### Sampling BC

Sampling BC groups the scintillators 4,5,6 (section B) and 7,8,9 (section C ).

Internally, to give more seupprojectivity, it is divided in 2 sections. One cell of sample BC groups the cells of sections B and C with the same number, e.g., cell BC1 groups B1 and C1.

The first section (B) contains scintillators 4,5 and 6, and is read out by 2 fibers: scintillator tiles 4 and 6 are read out by the same fiber, and tile 5 is read out by the other fiber. The average radius of this section is R=2790 mm. Table 2 shows, for each \(\eta\) position, the Z coordinate relative to the center of the module, the Z coordinate with respect to the left side, and the position of the fiber inside a submodule (submodule number and half period number).

The second section (C, scintillators 7,8 and 9) is read out by 2 fibers in the same way, 1 fiber for scintillators 7 and 9, and the other for scintillator 8. The average radius of this second section is R=3210 mm. For this section, the cell coordinates are shown in table 3.

The total number of readout cells per module is 36 for this sampling. The extreme cells BC8 and B9 are not complete (they cover \(\Delta\eta<\)0.1, and there

### Sampling D

Sampling D is the most outer sampling of TILECAL. The average radius of this sampling is R=3625 mm. It groups the two largest scintillator tiles, 10 and 11. Each tile is read out by 1 single fiber. For this sampling the granularity in \(\eta\) is twice as big as in the previous samplings. The cell coordinates for this sampling are shown in table 4.

The total number of readout cells per module for this sampling is 16. Cells D4 are not complete (they cover \(\Delta\eta<\)0.2).
