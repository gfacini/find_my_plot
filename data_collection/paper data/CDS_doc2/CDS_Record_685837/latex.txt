## 1 General Considerations and Physics Arguments

Tracking in the central region of the EAGLE spectrometer means finding tracks, measuring momentum and reconstructing primary (and secondary vertices) and linking tracks to the correct vertex. Three sets of position sensitive detectors : I, II, III - see Fig. 1 - placed at different radii, and having different roles are considered. Tracking in the forward direction is done by separate detectors.

Pattern recognition is a special problem which has been addressed by D. Saxon at the EAGLE tracking meeting in August [1]. We assume here that unambiguous track finding is easier, if one is not measuring individual points on tracks but track vectors which can be linked together. Such an approach requires grouping detectors into sets of closely spaced layers ("_superlayers"_).

To measure the momenta of particles, one needs to measure the sagitta of tracks which can be done using the interaction point as a constraint and the tracks position in detectors I and II of Fig. 1. The momentum resolution of a tracking system, for different positions of the central tracking layers, was studied by A. Poppleton [2]; in Fig. 2 the results are presented. It can be seen that the radial position of the middle detectors II is not very critical and they can be placed between radius R = 20 - 50 cm. For these calculation, it is assumed that the resolution of the tracking system is equal to 45 \(\mu\)m at station I and 15 \(\mu\)m at station II. The momentum resolution is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in Fig. 2.

Another important role of the tracking system is the reconstruction of vertices in the case of simultaneous interactions. The plot presented in Fig. 3 shows the probability of their separation along the extended interaction region (\(\sigma\) = 7 cm) as the function of the resolution of the tracking system in the z direction and for different luminosities [3]. Currently we are considering 2 scenarios. A very good z resolution is less than 100 microns using orthogonal strips allowing clean vertex separation at the highest luminosity or a more modest resolution in z of about 1 mm, which can be obtained with strips oriented at a small stereo angle.

The best performance of a vertexing system is obtained if one places a position detector as close to the interaction point as possible. This has been quantified by studies of S. Gadomski on b-jet tagging [3] and subsequent work.

* 35 cm, with a spatial resolution of 20
- 30 \(\mu\)m per point,
* a vertex layer at the radius of about 10 cm with \(\leq\) 20 \(\mu\)m resolution.

We consider two possible geometries, which at this stage are driven mostly by technical considerations. The difference in performance for physics is not large and is still under study.

1. A barrel geometry, shown schematically in Fig. 8a, which uses gas cooling.
2. A cylindrical one with forward cones - shown in Fig. 8b, which is water cooled.

Both options give substantial savings in the amount of silicon needed in comparison with cylinders covering the same pseudorapidity range. Both of the designs are under active study; in Appendix I some details of the initial studies of a barrel-shaped detector with gas cooling are presented. This solution is based on helium gas cooling which, having advantages of low mass and easy choice of operational temperatures, is pursued by the RD20 collaboration. First results look promising [4]. Below we list some of the major points of the barrel design.

The Silicon Inner Tracker/Vertex can be built as two half-shells (subdivided in the R-\(\theta\) plane), which can be accurately surveyed before installation and then joined around the beam pipe when the spectrometer is open and then installed.

There will be one main support shell (carbon/carbon composite or beryllium) which will carry all silicon detectors and their readout electronics with integrated power lines and signal cables/fibres.

Up to four tracking layers, arranged as two superlayers of silicon strip detectors assembled out of detector modules are placed on both sides of the supporting shell. The pseudorapidity coverage will extend to \(\eta\equiv 2\).

Each of the modules will be built out of a number of silicon detectors hybridized with frontend electronics and aligned with respect to each other. Individual modules will be mechanically self-supporting and their performances can be electronically tested before assembly.

-5.

In addition to the tracking layers, there is an additional vertex layer (a superlayer) extending over about 50 cm attached to the main shell and supported on two endrings around the interaction point. Such a layer can be assembled, tested and aligned independently. As it is relatively small and "simple" (not too expensive), it could be exchanged, if and when necessary. We consider either the replacement by the same type of detector (if a substantial degradation is observed in the process of irradiation) or a replacement by a next generation of semiconductor detectors, such as GaAS strip detectors or Si pixels.

The total amount of material is 4 - 9% X0, depending on the \(\theta\) angle.

3DETECTORS AND READOUT ELECTRONICS

### Detectors

At present only silicon technology is mature enough to allow the realistic design of a large detector. However, we do not exclude that in the future new radiation-hard technologies will be useful - in particular, for the closest vertex layers and the very forward, small-angle detectors, which will be exposed to heavy radiation.

As basic building blocks, we plan to use double-sided AC-coupled, silicon strip detectors but we may also use single-sided ones. These kinds of detector have been used in a number of experiments (ALEPH, DELPHI, OPAL NA38), where their performances are rather well understood, and are being extensively tested now for use at LHC (RD2 [5], RD20 [6], SDC [7]). They have been exposed to high fluxes of neutrons (up to 10\({}^{14}\)n/cm\({}^{2}\)) and high doses of gammas (up to 2 Mrad) - the results are compiled in Appendix II. The leakage current development seems to be well parametrized and understood. Cooling to a temperature below 0\({}^{\circ}\)C will eliminate the problem of noise increase and rise of power dissipation.

The detectors need to be of modest sizes (60 mm \(\times\) 30-60 mm), which is preferable from the point of view of the total leakage current per strip, interstrip capacitance and the signal propagation, as well as the cost. The strip pitch of these detectors will be between 50 \(\upmu\)m and 100 \(\upmu\)m,. Strips on two sides can be parallel, orthogonal or at small stereo angle. Where appropriate, the detectors will be glued and strips bonded together to form larger units.

-6 -

The number of layers (number of measuring points), orientation of strips and the readout pitch needs optimization and Monte Carlo studies of detector performances for different options are foreseen.

### Electronics

Frontend electronics is being developed by a few groups (RD2 [5], RD20 [8], SDC [7]) and the results are encouraging. It is still too early to freeze the design and to choose a technology while the groups are studying the different systems.

A basic scheme consists of a preamplifier, analog data buffer and a data processor/digitizer; a digital solution also exists and it requires a discriminator just after an amplifier and a digital buffer. The RD20 collaboration has a novel approach to signal treatment and they want to use a "slow" preamplifier and a special pulse shape processor to find the time tag [9] - it is expected that such a design can be superior from the point of view of signal-to-noise ratio and power consumption.

The clock and signal transmission also requires new solutions. All the electronics has to synchronized with the operation of the LHC accelerator - a 67 MHz clock frequency has to be distributed to all the readout chips. It may be necessary to use optical fibres and PIN diodes for clock distribution, to reduce the problems of electromagnetic radiation and pick-up.

The problem of data collection from a system of millions of channels also requires some special attention. There have to be special circuits which will do the data sparsification and multiplexing. The data have to be sent out from the detector probably also using opto-electronics devices and fibres. There are a number of promising developments going on in this field, but already now there exist devices and fibres which allow the design of a digital data transmission system which would work in a radiation environment. The cost would be modest and the power dissipation looks reasonable [10] - see Appendix III.

## 4 Near Future Plans and Cost Estimate

We plan to do the following studies in 1992 and part of 1993 (for the most part within the RD20 collaboration) :

* physics simulation (eg, top physics through b tagging),-7.
* optimization of the detector design (track reconstruction, pattern recognition and momentum results for different options : number of layers, kind of detectors, strip orientation, readout pitch, etc.),
* elaboration of an assembly and alignment procedure of the complete vertex/tracker,
* FE calculations and prototyping of different mechanical components (supporting shells, dummy modules, etc.),
* design and testing of different cooling options,
* development of ideas on the readout architecture and its computer modeling (Verilog, MODSIM, etc.),
* radiation damage studies to readout electronics,
* assembling of dummy detector modules with high speed readout electronics and testing them.

All of these calculations, prototyping and testing will provide us with a solid basis for the preparation of a technical proposal for a Silicon Inner Tracker/Vertex for EAGLE in 1993.

Below we provide a first, very approximate, cost estimate. We break it up into five different items :

1. Simulation, prototyping and testing of selected solutions and components :

- it is assumed that this will be done within already existing R&D projects and/or within budgets presently available or being expected by the labs involved,
2. Silicon strip detectors :

- the design presented in Appendix I contains about 4000 individual strip detectors with surface area 18
- 36 cm\({}^{2}\). The present cost of strip detectors varies between 50
- 300 SFr/cm\({}^{2}\), depending on the complexity, quantity, etc.
- we believe that for large orders it could be 90 SFr/cm\({}^{2}\) for double-sided detectors). If we take a surface of 13 m\({}^{2}\) (as in Appendix I) then we get : 13*10\({}^{4}\)cm\({}^{2}\)\(\times\) 60 SFr/cm\({}^{2}\) = 11.7 MSFr. Every effort is being made at present to
-8. make the detectors cheaper but the final cost cannot yet be guaranteed,
3. Readout electronics : - the total number of channels of an example shown in Appendix I is about 9 million where all detectors are double-sided and the readout pitch is 50 \(\upmu\)). Realistically this number will have to reduce by a factor of about 2 for an optimized version of the detector (larger readout pitch, optimized geometry, etc.), i.e. to about 4 - 5 million. The present cost of ASIC chips for strip detectors is about 50 SFr/128 channels. We take a rather commonly quoted number of 1 SFr/channel for radiation-hard electronics (which includes powering, cables and data acquisition). This gives a total cost of about 4.5 MSFr,
4. Mechanics, cooling and alignment : - as yet we have no reliable cost estimate, as the design is not complete, some of the components will have to be made by industry. By extrapolating from existing detectors, we assign 5 MSFr to this part (note that the SSC Si Tracker Conceptual design report estimated the cost of mechanics of a much larger system, which supports about 40 m2 of silicon, to be about 8 M5[11],
5. Testing facilities and test equipment : - it is difficult to list now all the necessary equipment which will be needed (mechanical stands, cooling facilities, position measuring devices, alignment lasers, computers, test equipment, etc.). We know that such a complicated and delicate apparatus will require quite sophisticated test facilities and again extrapolating from past experience, we take this cost as equal to 5 MSFr, out of which, we assume, 50% can be provided by participating labs in the form of test equipment. Thus the final cost will be around 2.5 MSFr.

The above numbers are summarized in Table 3 (in MSFr). Finally, given the uncertainty of the price of detectors, we add a contingency of 30%.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Item & Cost (MSFr) \\ \hline Design and prototyping & \\ Detectors & 11.7 \\ Electronics & 4.5 \\ Mechanics, cooling, alignment & 5.0 \\ Testing facilities & 2.5 \\ \hline Subtotal & 23.7 \\ \hline Contingency & 7.9 \\ \hline \hline TOTAL & 31.6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Si-vertex/tracker

(ideas to give an input to a wider discussion on

mechanics, cooling and system aspects of the detector)

**General assumptions:**

* _detector is to be a tool for vertexing & momentum measurement_
* _system should fit to a general EAGLE layout and should be easy to install_

_( it means R<40 mm)_
* _gas helium cooling at a temperature_

_below zero C-grad is to be used_1.Proposed geometry of the tracker:

- 3 super-layers (each consists of 2 layers of wafers situated in a distance of 15 mm)

- inner s-layer (for vertexing), 85 mm < R <125 mm, n<1.5

- middle & outer s-layers (momentum measurement),

130 mm < R < 250 mm, 205 mm < R < 365 mm respectively, n < 2 for both

Fig. 1. shows an image of the wafer ditribution in space

2. Ideas on a mechanical support

- Inner s-layer
- modules of nearly 500 mm length are sup-

poted on light endrings

- other s-layers
- 200 to 300 mm long modules fixed to a common cylindrical support (fig. 2.)

3. Estimation of some characteristic numbers

- about 4000 detector wafers (from 60 by 32 to 60 by 64 mm)

- nearly 9 milions of read-out channels

- about 13 kW of power dissipated (when 1.5mW/ch)

- about 1.7 m of length

- about 2500 A of current

- power lines need 1.5 kg of copper or 1 kg of beryllium (when driven from both ends of the detector)

- nearly 30 kilograms in total

- 2 -

## 4 Ideas on cooling

- using gas helium with velocity of 7m/s (mass flow equivalent to an air flow with velocity of 1m/s) blowing through all the detector (needed flow rate
- 3 cu. m/s)

- in-out helium temperature difference = 7 K.

- all the detector is situated inside a gas tight channel which is a part of a close loop for helium flow (with heat exchanger etc.)

## 5 Some Important questions to be answered:

- Could we glue the front-end chips directly on wafer surface with a thin screen only?

- Could we for power lines use beryllium sheets which simultanously would be a part of the support structure?

- Could we put all the rest of read-out elements on the shell structure which is v ery well cooled and where we have a lot of space?

## 6 Installation Inside a spectrometer

- The detector consists of two half-moon parts which should be join together outside (in a free space between a barrel and an endcap when the spectrometer is open) around the beampipe.

- Once when these two parts are join all the detector is driven on rails close to its final position where supporting arms are fixed to the spectrometer.

- Final position of the detector could be achived with a step motor system driven by accurate position measurement device.
