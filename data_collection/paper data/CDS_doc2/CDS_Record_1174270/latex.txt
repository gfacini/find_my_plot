###### Abstract

The prospects for Higgs searches in the \(H+0j\) (\(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\)), \(H+2j\) (\(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\)), and \(H+2j\) (\(H\to WW\to\ell\nu qq\)) channels at ATLAS are presented, including realistic effects such as trigger efficiencies and detector misalignment, with an emphasis on practical methods to estimate the backgrounds using control samples in data. With 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, one would expect to be able to discover a Standard Model Higgs boson in the mass range \(135<m_{H}<190\) GeV and to be able to measure its mass with a precision of about 7 GeV if its true mass is 130 GeV or about 2 GeV if its true mass is 160 GeV.

Introduction

The nature of the Electroweak symmetry breaking sector is arguably the most important unknown in particle physics today. An introduction to the Higgs mechanism and an overview of the possible search channels for a (standard model) Higgs boson at the LHC can be found in Ref. [1]. This note studies the sensitivity of Higgs boson searches in the decay mode \(H\to WW\) to a Standard Model Higgs boson. Special emphasis is placed on in-situ control samples that can be used to estimate the background contributions using data and on the systematic uncertainties associated with these background determination methods.

The note is organised as follows: Section 2 discusses the production mechanisms and final states under study, the relevant backgrounds for each process and the Monte Carlo generators used to model them. In Section 3, the performance of the reconstruction for the various final-state particles is described. In Section 4, an overview of statistical issues common to most of the analyses is presented. Section 5 describes the event selection and control samples for a search for \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) in events where no hard jets are reconstructed in the detector. In Section 6, the analysis of the \(H+2j\), \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) channel is presented, and in Section 7, an analysis of events where one of the \(W\) bosons decays to two jets is discussed. Finally, in Section 8, the combined sensitivity of the ATLAS detector to the presence of neutral scalar resonances in the \(W\) pair final state is presented.

## 2 Physics Processes and Monte Carlo

In the Standard Model, there are two dominant production modes of the Higgs boson in the kinematic region of interest for the \(H\to WW\) decay mode: gluon fusion and Vector Boson Fusion (VBF). In studies of the former production mode, one must consider background processes that yield two leptons and significant missing transverse energy in the final state; in the latter, the final state also includes two hard jets (from the struck quarks) which tend to be well-separated in pseudorapidity. This note considers the following signal and background processes:

* Higgs boson production via gluon fusion: This is the dominant production mechanism for the signal considered in the analysis of Section 5; it is modeled with 48500 events generated by MC@NLO[2, 3]. A Higgs boson decay matrix element similar to the one used in Ref. [4] was used to reweight this Monte Carlo sample to include the complete spin correlations for the Higgs decay.
* Higgs boson production via Vector Boson Fusion: This is the dominant production mechanism for the Higgs boson searches of Sections 6 and 7. This process is modeled with the generators provided in PYTHIA[5] (14500 events), HERWIG[6] (18050 events), and SHERPA[7] (19950 events).
* \(pp\to WW\) production. This is the dominant background contribution to the analysis studied in Section 5; in that analysis, it is modeled with 178450 events generated by MC@NLO. It is important to note that MC@NLO only calculates the \(O(\alpha_{s}^{0})\) and \(O(\alpha_{s}^{1})\) contributions to this process; it does not compute the \(O(\alpha_{s}^{2})\) contributions. Because of the large gluon luminosity expected at LHC it is important to include at least the gluon-initiated component (where the \(W\) pair production proceeds via a quark box) for the analysis of the fully jet-vetoed final state. This contribution is modeled with 176300 events produced using the generator in Ref. [8]. In the Vector Boson Fusion searches, the contributions from processes like \(qq\to WWqq\) (mediated by the exchange of a weak boson or a gluon) become important. Therefore, a sample of 171250events generated with ALPGEN [9, 10] is used instead of MC@NLO to model the \(pp\to WWjj\) background in the analysis of Section 6.
* \(t\overline{t}\) production. The two top quarks decay into a pair of \(W\) bosons and two b jets. The cross-section is expected to be dominated by doubly resonant \(t\overline{t}\) production in the Vector Boson Fusion searches of Sections 6 and 7; however, for the search of Section 5, one must also take care to handle the single-top background correctly. The absolute cross-section for the contribution from single top production is presently only known with leading-order uncertainties, but since the search presented in Section 5 normalises the top background using data, it is only necessary to consider its potential impact on the extrapolation from the b-tagged to the b-vetoed region. In the estimation of the sensitivity of all channels under study, a sample of 538300 events generated with MC@NLO is used to model this background. Two MadEvent [11, 12, 13] samples are used to estimate the importance of the contribution from single-top production in the \(H+0j\) channel: one contains all matrix elements for \(pp\to WWbb\); the other contains only the doubly-resonant contribution.
* \(Z\to ll\) production. In channels with two electrons or two muons, the direct decays of \(Z\to ee\) and \(Z\to\mu\mu\) dominate, but this background can also contribute to \(e\mu\) final states when the \(Z\) decays to a pair of \(\tau\) leptons which both decay leptonically. This background is modeled with a sample of 163200 events generated with PYTHIA in the \(H+0j\) analysis of Section 5 and with a sample of 38150 events produced using ALPGEN in the \(H+2j\) analysis of Section 6.
* W+\(n\) jets production, with \(n\leq 5\). This is the dominant background for the lepton-hadron channel; however, it can also play a role in the dilepton channels as a source of fakes. This background is modeled using a sample of 411424 events generated with ALPGEN. A special subset of this background is W+c+\(n\) jets, with \(n\leq 4\). The charm production in association with a W boson through processes like \(gs\to Wc\) is enhanced, due to the large parton density function of strange sea quarks and the large CKM matrix element \(|V_{cs}|\). Decays of charm mesons are a potential source of leptons. Lepton isolation cuts are tuned on this kind of background, to reach the necessary rejection against leptons from semileptonic charm- or b- decays. [14].
* \(b\overline{b}\), \(c\overline{c}\) and QCD multi-jet. Due to the large cross section of these processes they could be a further source of background. The large amount of CPU power needed makes a Monte Carlo simulation of these backgrounds currently unrealistic. For the dilepton channels the requirement of two leptons and missing transverse energy should reduce these backgrounds to a negligible level.

Table 1 gives an overview of the cross sections of the signal and background samples used in this note. Detailed tables of the Higgs boson cross sections and branching ratios can be found in Ref. [1].

## 3 Reconstruction

The final states considered here all include leptons. Section 3.1 briefly describes the lepton selection criteria and other central aspects of the reconstruction used in this note. Then, in Section 3.2, a few important details about jets, \(E_{T}^{miss}\), and pile-up are briefly discussed. Note that the results presented in this note were made using version 12 of the ATLAS software, whereas the results on detector performance in Refs. [15] and [16] are based on release 13.

### Leptons

The electron selection consists of the following criteria :* Electrons are identified using the standard ATLAS criteria described in Ref. [15]. In the \(H+0j\) (\(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\)) and \(H+2j\) (\(H\to WW\to\ell\nu qq\)) channels, tight electrons are required. In the case of the \(H+2j\), \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) analysis of Section 6, a sufficiently strong rejection against the \(W\)+jets background can be achieved by applying cuts on the VBF tagging jets that it is possible to use a medium electrons instead.
* A track match is required. The transverse impact parameter significance of the matched track, \(d_{0}/\sigma_{d_{0}}\), is required to be less than 10.
* Candidates are required to be well isolated. Calorimeter isolation in a \(\Delta R\) cone of 0.2 is required to be less than 5 GeV, and \(\Sigma p_{T}\) of tracks in a cone of \(\Delta R<0.4\), excluding tracks from other lepton candidates and tracks with \(p_{T}<1\) GeV, is required to be less than 5 GeV.
* Kinematic acceptance: \(p_{T}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) (The \(p_{T}\) threshold is larger for the lepton-hadron channel). Electron candidates in the crack region, \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\), are excluded.

It has been shown that similar isolation criteria can effectively suppress the background from W+c+jet events, where a second lepton comes from charm decay, to negligible levels.

\(W\)+jets is one of the main sources of fake backgrounds for the dilepton channels; it is crucial to achieve a good rejection against this background. The probability for a jet to be misreconstructed as an electron was derived from a W(\(\rightarrow\mu\nu\))+jets sample which contains no true high \(p_{T}\) electrons. The average efficiency to reconstruct an electron candidate without isolation cuts in the \(gg\to H\to WW\) signal events is 60.3\(\pm\)0.5%; the additional isolation criteria reduce this to 50.0\(\pm\)0.5% efficiency. With all cuts, the average fake rate as determined from \(W\rightarrow\mu\nu\)+jets events is \((1.7\pm 0.2)\times 10^{-4}\) before isolation and \((6.7^{+1.5}_{-1.3})\times 10^{-5}\) after isolation.

The muon selection consists of a similar set of cuts :

* Combined muons and best match to an inner detector track [16].
* Calorimeter Isolation based on the \(etcone20\) variable [16] (\(etcone20<2.5\) GeV) and track isolation (in a cone of \(\Delta R<0.4\)) as for electrons, but with a different \(p_{T}\) threshold, \(\Sigma p_{T}<3\) GeV.
* Transverse impact parameter significance less than 10.
* \(p_{T}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) (The \(p_{T}\) threshold is larger for the lepton-hadron channel)

As for the electrons, similar isolation criteria were shown to be effective against the W+c+jet background. The performance for muons is better than for electrons. The average efficiency to reconstruct a muon candidate in \(gg\to H\to WW\) signal events is \(94.2\pm 0.1\%\) before isolation cuts and \(77.1\pm 0.2\%\) after applying cuts. The corresponding fake rate in \(W\to e\nu+\)jets events is \((1.7^{+0.6}_{-0.5})\times 10^{-5}\) after isolation cuts are applied.

### Jets, Missing \(p_{T}\), and Pile-up

In the \(H+2j\) searches of Sections 6 and 7, the presence of at least two jets with \(p_{T}>20\) and a large difference in pseudorapidity are required. It is frequently the case that at least one of these jets will land in the forward region of the detector. To minimise the effect of calorimeter noise and maximise efficiency for the jets of interest to this study, jets reconstructed from topological clusters are used, rather than jets reconstructed from calorimeter towers [17]. For VBF Higgs boson signal processes the efficiency for jets with a cone size of \(\Delta R=0.4\) from topological clusters is 94.3% in the central detector region and 95.3% in the forward region. For jets from calorimeter towers the efficiency is significantly lower with 92.4% in the central detector region and 84.1% in the forward region.

All the searches considered in this note make use of analysis techniques that either select or give a large weight to events without additional jets; in either case, events are effectively rejected if they contain extra jets beyond those jets (if any) that are explicitly required by the analysis. Even in the first years of "low-luminosity" data taking at the LHC, analyses will be affected by the pile-up of multiple collisions per beam crossing. Low \(p_{T}\) QCD interactions (minimum-bias) are present simultaneously to a hard interaction. Such pile-up events will give rise to jet activity that can sometimes cause interesting signal events to be erroneously rejected; in selecting a jet algorithm, it is necessary to consider this effect. Single minimum-bias events have a three times lower probability to be discarded by the central jet veto cut when using jets reconstructed with a cone size of \(\Delta R=0.4\) instead of jets with a cone size of \(\Delta R=0.7\). Furthermore, in the presence of pile-up the jet calibration has to correct for the additional energy that is not from the hard interaction. Due to the well defined jet area, this is much easier done with a cone jet algorithm than with a \(k_{t}\) jet algorithm.

For the reasons mentioned above, the analyses in this note have used jets reconstructed from topological clusters with a cone algorithm of \(\Delta R=0.4\)[17]. Jet efficiencies increase with \(E_{T}\) and are rather stable with \(|\eta|\). However it should be noted that the efficiency drops at \(|\eta|\geq 4.8\) near the boundary of the forward calorimeter, as expected. Therefore this note uses only jets with \(|\eta|\leq 4.8\). Jets within a cone of \(\Delta R<0.4\) of any electron candidate are ignored.

There are other ways to minimise the impact of pile-up; the tracking system of the ATLAS detector is designed to separate the vertices of the different inelastic collisions in an event. Jets built of tracks emerging from the same vertex as the leptons from the Higgs boson decay should be insensitive to pile-up if the vertex reconstruction is working as expected.

While the \(H\to WW\) searches presented in this note use standard calorimeter jets for the jet veto, it is important to illustrate the potential of track jets. The \(H+2j\), \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) analysis has been studied as an example.

Track jets are reconstructed from only those tracks that have \(p_{T}>0.5\) and with at least 7 hits in the pixel and semiconductor tracker. The Higgs boson production vertex is taken to be the vertex for which the sum of the transverse energies of the emerging tracks is largest. All tracks that emerge from this vertex and are not associated with an isolated lepton are fed into the standard ATLAS cone \(\Delta R=0.4\) jet algorithm. Leptons are considered isolated if the sum of the transverse energies of all tracks from the same vertex as the lepton in a cone of 0.01\(<\Delta R<0.2\) around the lepton is less than 5.

The independence of the track jets to activity from pile-up is reflected in the jet \(p_{T}\) distributions in the \(H\to WW\) signal sample without and with pile-up (pile-up was generated with an average of 2.3additional events) in Figure 1. The additional \(pp\) collisions in presence of pile-up created additional standard jets at low transverse energies while the multiplicities of track jets are unaffected by pile-up.

A central jet veto cut is constructed using track jets in the acceptance region of the inner detector of \(|\eta|<2.5\) and standard jets at larger pseudorapidities (up to \(|\eta|<3.2\)). The cut on the transverse momentum of the track jets is chosen such that the same rejection efficiency is obtained for \(H\to WW\) events without pile-up as for the jet veto based on standard jets. This requires a lowering of the \(p_{T}\) cut from 20 GeV for standard jets to 12.3 GeV for track jets.

Table 2 shows the fraction of events passing the different options for the central jet veto. The central jet veto based on standard jets is sensitive to pile-up while the track jets show only small sensitivity to pile-up. The combination of the track jet veto in \(|\eta|<2.5\) and the standard jet veto in \(|\eta|>2.5\) shows robustness against pile-up.

The performance of the missing transverse momentum reconstruction is strongly affected by the presence of pile-up. In this study, the cell based reconstruction algorithm described in Ref. [18] has been used.

Fortunately, the \(H\to WW\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) searches are not very sensitive to the resolution of \(E_{T}^{miss}\). Since the Higgs boson mass cannot be directly reconstructed in the \(2\ell 2\nu\) final state, a transverse mass is used; although this does have a peak centred around the true value of the Higgs boson mass, the distribution is very broad (several tens of GeV). Therefore a degraded \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution is unlikely to significantly alter the transverse mass shape unless the degradation is rather severe. The \(H+2j\) (\(H\to WW\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\)) analysis of Section 6 makes use only of this transverse mass and observables related to the leptons and the jet activity in the event; the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) cut in that analysis serves mostly to reject backgrounds like \(Z\to ee/\mu\mu\) which have no intrinsic \(E_{T}^{miss}\). The \(H+0j\) analysis of Section 5 does make use of the transverse momen

tum of the Higgs boson candidate, which is obviously very sensitive to the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution; however, that analysis involves a fitting algorithm developed with exactly this concern in mind and includes checks that demonstrate that the algorithm still works reliably in the presence of a degraded \(E_{T}^{miss}\) measurement.

In the case of the \(H\to WW\to\ell\nu qq\) analysis of Section 7, the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is used in the reconstruction of the Higgs boson candidate's invariant mass. In principle, then, a degraded \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution does propagate into the Higgs boson mass resolution, and so problems with the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction are more harmful to the \(H\to WW\to\ell\nu qq\) channel than to the dilepton channels. However, for a Standard Model-like Higgs boson with a mass above \(\approx 300\) GeV, the natural width of the Higgs boson tends to become rather large, and the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution is again not the primary concern of the analysis.

Mismeasurements of jets and detector inefficiencies can lead to instrumental \(E_{T}^{miss}\). It is very hard to predict such effects without real data and no cuts to reduce instrumental \(E_{T}^{miss}\) are currently foreseen.

## 4 Statistical Formalism

The sensitivity estimates presented in this note use a fit-based hypothesis testing procedure. Unless stated otherwise, selection cuts are always independent of the Higgs boson mass hypothesis, no matter how broad the range of masses where the search is sensitive. To take advantage of the discriminating power contained in variables for which the distribution depends significantly on the Higgs boson mass hypothesis or is not precisely predicted by theory, a maximum-Likelihood fit to those variables is used. To perform the hypothesis test itself, a Likelihood Ratio is used, \(\lambda=L_{s+b}/L_{bg-only}\). The numerator and denominator of this ratio are obtained from separate fits to the data, with the number of signal floating as a free parameter (subject to the constraint \(N_{s}\geq 0\)) in the fit for \(L_{s+b}\), and with the number of signal fixed to zero in the fit for \(L_{bg-only}\). The sampling distributions of \(\lambda\) at a given luminosity (in the presence of signal and in its absence) are studied by generating pseudo-experimental outcomes and performing the full fit to each outcome.

Throughout this note, when a fit is performed, the Higgs boson mass \(m_{H}\) is allowed to float as a free parameter in the fit. The resulting significance estimates therefore represent the probability that, in the absence of signal, a background fluctuation anywhere in the allowed mass range would produce an excess at least as significant as the observed excess. This is slightly different from the convention adopted in

Figure 2: Left: The log Likelihood Ratio distributions for toy Monte Carlo corresponding to the \(H\to WW\to\ell\nu qq\) analysis at 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) for background-only outcomes (red) and signal-plus background outcomes with several values of the Higgs boson mass. Right: The same plot, but for the \(H+2j\), \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) analysis.

some other studies, where the significance represents the probability that a background fluctuation would produce an excess that is consistent with a specified mass and at least as significant as the observed excess.

Figure 2 shows two examples of the Likelihood Ratio probability distributions. The left plot shows the sampling distribution of the Likelihood Ratio for the \(H\to WW\to\ell\nu qq\) fit discussed in Section 7 (assuming a negligible background from fakes), and the right plot shows the corresponding distributions for the analysis of Section 6.2. A fit to the real data would yield one value of \(\lambda\); to obtain a p-value, one would integrate the red distribution in the acceptance region, i.e. from the observed value of \(\lambda\) to infinity. In the absence of data, the expected significance is computed by taking the "observed" value of \(\lambda\) to be the median of the signal-plus-background distribution for a given mass. The expected significance \(Z\) reported here is one-sided, i.e., \(Z=\sqrt{2}\mathrm{erfc}^{-1}(2p)\). When the number of pseudo-experimental outcomes in the acceptance region is too small, the background-only Likelihood Ratio distribution is extrapolated with an exponential decay.

## 5 Leptonic \(W\) Pair Production with No Hard Jets

The \(H+0j\), \(H\to WW\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) channel has been shown to have a strong discovery potential. [19, 20, 21, 22] The basic event selection consists of only a few simple cuts:

* Require that the event has exactly two isolated, opposite-sign leptons (electron or muon) with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV.
* To suppress backgrounds from single-top production, backgrounds from dileptonic decays of \(b\overline{b}\) and \(c\overline{c}\) resonances, and lepton pairs from \(b\to c\) cascade decays, require that the invariant mass \(m_{ll}\) of the leptons is between 12 GeV and 300 GeV.
* Require that the event has \(E_{T}^{miss}>30\) GeV

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c c c c c} \hline Selection & Selection cuts & \(gg\to H\) & \(t\overline{t}\) & \(WW\) & \(Z\to\tau\tau\) & \(W+jets\) \\ \hline \multirow{4}{*}{pre- selection} & Lepton Selection\(+M_{ll}\) & 166.4 & 6501 & 718.12 & 4171 & 209.1 \\  & \(p_{T}{}^{miss}>30\) GeV & 147.7 & 5617 & 505.25 & 526.3 & 181.6 \\  & \(Z\to\tau\tau\) Rej. & 145.8 & 5215 & 485.12 & 164.2 & 150.4 \\  & Jet Veto & 61.80 & 14.84 & 238.35 & 31.91 & 76.12 \\  & b-veto & 61.56 & 6.85 & 237.87 & 30.76 & 76.12 \\ \hline \hline \multirow{4}{*}{signal region} & \(\Delta\phi_{ll}<1.575\), & \multirow{4}{*}{50.6\(\pm\)2.5} & \multirow{4}{*}{2.3\(\pm\)1.6} & \multirow{4}{*}{85.4\(\pm\)2.7} & \multirow{4}{*}{\(<\)1.7} & \multirow{4}{*}{38\(\pm\)38} \\  & \(M_{T}<600\) GeV & & & & & \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{3-6}  & \(\Delta\phi_{ll}>1.575\), & \multirow{4}{*}{10.9\(\pm\)1.1} & \multirow{4}{*}{4.6\(\pm\)2.3} & \multirow{4}{*}{151.9\(\pm\)3.6} & \multirow{4}{*}{30.8\(\pm\)4.2} & \multirow{4}{*}{38\(\pm\)38} \\ control region & \(M_{T}<600\) GeV & & & & & \\ \hline \hline b-tagged signal region & \(\Delta\phi_{ll}<1.575\) & - & 1.14\(\pm\)1.14 & - & - & - \\ \cline{1-1} \cline{3-6} b-tagged control region & \(\Delta\phi_{ll}>1.575\) & - & 5.71\(\pm\)2.55 & - & - & - \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Cut flows (in fb) for \(M_{H}=170\) GeV in the \(H+0j\), \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) channel. A ‘-’ indicates that the corresponding contribution is ignored in the fit. The WW background contains the two processes \(q\bar{q}\to WW\) and \(gg\to WW\).

* To suppress backgrounds from \(Z\to\tau\tau\), reconstruct the invariant mass of a hypothetical \(\tau\) pair using the collinear approximation [23]. If the energy fractions \(x_{\tau}^{1}\) and \(x_{\tau}^{2}\) are both positive and the invariant mass of the \(\tau\) pair \(M_{\tau\tau}\) is in the range \(|M_{\tau\tau}-M_{Z}|<25\) GeV, the event is rejected.
* To suppress backgrounds from top quark decays, reject events that contain any hard jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta_{j}|<4.8\).
* To further suppress the top background, reject events with any jets with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV and a b-tagging weight greater than 4.

Table 3 shows the cross-sections in the \(e\mu\) channel for signal and background after these cuts.

The trigger efficiency for signal is sufficiently large for this analysis to be viable. Events are required to pass at least one of the ATLAS single-lepton or double-lepton triggers. The level-1 trigger menus used here are 2EM15I, EM25I, EM60I, MU20, and MU40. For the Level 2 trigger and the event filter, events are required to pass the e25i, 2e15i, e60, or mu20i triggers. Details on the trigger menus can be found in Ref. [24]. For the \(e\mu\) channel considered here the trigger efficiency for L1 is 99.0%; for L2 it is 96.7%, and for the EF it is 95.2% The efficiency is quite high, and the trigger efficiency does not distort the shapes of the kinematic variables of interest in the signal in a significant way. Table 3 does not include the trigger efficiency, but it is taken into account as an overall scale factor for the signal and background when generating toy Monte Carlo to test the fitting algorithm described in the next section and in the calculation of the expected statistical significance for this channel.

After the basic event selection (all cuts from Table 3 including the cut on \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\)), the signal to background ratio is only \(\approx\)1:4, but there is still a good deal of discriminating power in the final state. This analysis focuses on three variables:

* the transverse opening angle \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\); a cut on this variable exploits differences in the spin correlations in the WW system in the Higgs signal and the WW background,
* the transverse mass \(M_{T}\), as defined in Ref. [25],
* the transverse momentum of the \(WW\) system, \(p_{T}{}^{WW}\), which tends to be slightly larger for signal than for WW background because gluon-initiated processes tend to have more initial-state radiation than quark-initiated processes.

The distributions of these variables are shown in Figure 3. To make use of the discriminating power of these variables, a maximum-likelihood fit is performed.

Figure 3: Left: transverse opening angle \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) of the two leptons after preselection cuts. Middle : transverse momentum \(p_{T}{}^{WW}\) of the WW system after preselection cuts. Right: transverse mass \(M_{T}\) for events with \(\Delta\phi_{ll}<1.575\) and \(p_{T}{}^{WW}>20\) GeV, in a fitted toy Monte Carlo outcome containing a Standard Model Higgs boson with \(M_{H}=170\) GeV, after 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. The Likelihood Ratio in this outcome is 30.69, which is typical for this value of \(M_{H}\) and this luminosity.

### Fitting Algorithm

The fit is a 2-dimensional fit of transverse mass and \({p_{T}}^{WW}\) in two bins of the dilepton opening angle \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) in the transverse plane. [26] The present study considers a fit to only those events with one electron and one muon, since an in-situ background extraction procedure for the \(Z\to ee/\mu\mu\) background has not yet been studied. After the preselection cuts and the additional requirement that \(M_{T}<600\) GeV is applied, the remaining events are separated into two subsamples, one with \(\Delta\phi_{ll}<1.575\) and the other with \(\Delta\phi_{ll}>1.575\). Table 3 shows the cross-sections for the signal and various backgrounds in these two regions. The region with large \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) (control region) is enriched in background and the region with small \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) (signal region) is enriched in signal.

The top background is estimated with the help of b-tagged control samples with the same kinematic cuts as the signal-enriched and background-enriched regions. Table 3 includes estimates of the top cross-section in the b-tagged control regions. In the present study, the b-tagging efficiency is assumed to be well-known (i.e., the ratio of cross-sections in the b-tagged and b-vetoed regions is taken from Monte Carlo), and the contamination from processes with only light jets in the b-tagged regions is ignored. The \(t\overline{t}\) cross-section estimates in Table 3 are based on Monte Carlo samples that use MC@NLO to model the top background; even if the b-tagging is well-understood, the ratio of the top cross-section in the b-tagged and b-vetoed regions is sensitive to the treatment of the single-top contribution to the background. Moreover, studies based on fast simulation samples have shown that there are also differences in the shape of the distributions of \(M_{T}\) and \({p_{T}}^{WW}\) between top background models based on doubly-resonant top production and models that include the singly-resonant and nonresonant processes. (For example, the single-top contribution leads to a larger number of events with large \(M_{T}\) and small \({p_{T}}^{WW}\).) Nevertheless, in the present study, standalone fits are performed on the b-tagged control samples before the fit to the b-vetoed regions begins, and the top background in the b-vetoed regions is estimated by extrapolating both the shape and the normalization from the b-tagged region to the b-vetoed region based on ratios obtained from MC@NLO.

The \(Z\to\tau\tau\) background is normalized and its shape is determined by studying a sample of \(Z\to\mu\mu\) events taken from real data, where the reconstructed muons are replaced by simulated taus [23]. Two-muon events with a dimuon invariant mass between 82 and 98 GeV are selected, and the same jet veto that is used in the rest of this analysis is applied to the selected events. The effective cross-section after these cuts is roughly 360 pb. The reconstructed muons in the event are replaced with simulated tau leptons, and the remaining event selection cuts are applied. The efficiency of those cuts is about 0.07%, leaving an effective cross-section of roughly 250 fb. To be conservative, the present study assumes that efficency factors will lower this figure to about 200 fb. A standalone fit to these "data-Monte-Carlo" events is performed to determine the shape and normalization of the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) background; in the final fit, the shape parameters are fixed and the normalization is rescaled by a factor that is assumed in this study to be well-predicted. The parameters obtained from the fit to the \(Z\to\tau\tau\) data-Monte-Carlo control sample are not allowed to float in the main fit.

At the time of this writing, an in-situ determination of fake backgrounds from processes such as \(W\)+jets has not yet been studied. For this study, a fixed probability distribution has been used to represent the fake backgrounds, assuming for the moment that the shape and normalization of fake backgrounds are well-predicted. Because of the limited size of the available \(W\)+jets Monte Carlo sample, there are not enough Monte Carlo events remaining after cuts to provide a prediction of the shape of the transverse mass vs. \({p_{T}}^{WW}\) distribution for \(W\)+jets; the shape of this distribution is therefore taken from a set of events with loosened isolation and shower shape cuts. This treatment ignores any potential systematic uncertainty on the \(W\)+jets background; future studies will attempt to address this in more detail.

Once the fits to the control samples are completed, a simultaneous fit of the two \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) bins in the b-vetoed region is performed. A few of the parameters that describe the shape of the transverse mass and \({p_{T}}^{WW}\) distributions of the \(WW\) background are allowed to float in the fit. The \({p_{T}}^{WW}\) distributions forthe \(WW\) background in the two regions are taken to be the same up to a parabolic distortion factor. The normalizations of the \(WW\) background are free to float independently; however, we add a penalty term of the form \((R_{fit}-R_{true})^{2}/\sigma_{R}^{2}\), where \(R_{fit}\) is the ratio of the best-fit number of \(WW\) background events in the small-\(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) region over the number in the large-\(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) region, \(R_{true}\) is the Monte Carlo prediction of the ratio taken from the central-value calculation, and \(\sigma_{R}\) is the uncertainty in the prediction of \(R_{true}\), taken to be 10%. This value of \(\sigma_{R}\) is chosen to be larger than the actual variation of R due to changes in the \(Q^{2}\) scale definition (about 5%) so that the constraint term does not cause a large bias in the observed value of \(R\); such a bias could be expected to lead to a degradation in the sensitivity of the hypothesis test. The value of \(\sigma_{R}\) has not been optimized; such a study may be performed in the future.

In order to demonstrate the robustness of the fit against systematic uncertainties, toy Monte Carlo has been used to compute the sampling distributions for the Likelihood Ratio in several scenarios where the "true" probability distribution has been distorted to model various sources of systematic error. Seven distorted scenarios are considered: four altered \(Q^{2}\) scale choices (factorization and renormalization scales raised and lowered by factors of 8), two alternative top background models (based on leading-order \(pp\to WWbb\) and leading-order \(pp\to tt\to WWbb\)), and one alternative model of all irreducible backgrounds where the \(x\) and \(y\) components of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) have been independently smeared by 5 GeV each. These alternative models have been derived using fast simulation because large-statistics Monte Carlo samples are needed in order to be sure any change in the shape of the observables is actually due to the systematic uncertainty under study and not merely a statistical fluctuation. In these systematic scenarios,

the background contribution from fakes is ignored. Figure 4 shows the Likelihood Ratio distribution for background-only outcomes (upper left) and the distribution of pulls of the fitted Higgs boson mass (upper right) for signal-plus-background outcomes with a true Higgs boson mass of 170 GeV. Both distributions are nearly independent of the systematic distortions.

The lower left plot in Figure 4 shows the linearity of the mass determination as a function of the true Higgs mass. The line shows the mean of a Gaussian fit to the region around the peak of the distribution of best-fit Higgs masses in the toy Monte Carlo sample for the case of nominal detector performance. The green band shows the width of the Gaussian and is a direct measure of the variability of the mass estimate on repetition of the experiment; the error bars show the median fit error. The typical variability of the mass determination at 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) ranges from 5.2 GeV at \(M_{H}=\)130 GeV to 1.6 GeV at \(M_{H}=\)160 GeV to 4.2 GeV at \(M_{H}=\)190 GeV.

Figure 4 also shows the expected significance for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). This channel is most promising for Higgs boson masses near the \(WW\) threshold.

### Cross-check with a Number-Counting Analysis

A number counting analysis of this channel has been performed as a cross-check. The signal region is defined by the basic event selection in addition to the following few additional cuts: \(p_{T}{}^{WW}>10\) GeV, \(M_{ll}<64\) GeV, \(\Delta\phi_{ll}<1.5\), and \(50<M_{T}<180\) GeV. A control region is defined by the requirements \(p_{T}{}^{WW}>10\) GeV, \(80<M_{ll}<300\) GeV, and \(\Delta\phi_{ll}>1.5\). In order to normalize the top background, it is also useful to define a b-tagged region with similar kinematic cuts: \(p_{T}{}^{WW}>10\) GeV and \(\Delta\phi_{ll}>1.5\). Table 4 shows the cross-sections for signal and backgrounds in these regions. Only one of the \(W+\)jets events passes all the selection cuts for the signal-like region; it corresponds to a cross-section of 38 fb. None of the \(W+\)jets events survives in either control region. Because this background is modeled with Alpgen \(W+n\) jets, with \(n\leq 5\), and because the Monte Carlo was generated with different effective luminosities for different jet multiplicities, it is not straightforward to compute a meaningful upper bound on the \(W+\)jets cross-section in the control regions. The quoted cross-section is simply three times the cross-section observed in the signal region (which is based on one Monte Carlo event).

The ratios of background cross-sections in the various regions have to come from a theoretical prediction; in a number-counting approach there is no simple way to constrain them with data. A similar background normalization strategy was studied in Refs. [27] and [28]; in Ref. [27], the theoretical error on the ratio of \(WW\) cross-sections in the signal-like region and the control region was 5%, the systematic error on the ratio of the top background cross-sections in the signal-like and b-tagged regions was 9%, and the uncertainty on the ratio of the top background cross-sections in the control region and the b-tagged regions was also 9%. These systematic errors have not been re-evaluated in the context of this analysis, nor have the relevant instrumental systematic errors been computed; this cross-check simply uses these values as the systematic uncertainties on the extrapolations.

Using the cross-sections for \(M_{H}=170\) GeV in Table 4 and taking into account the additional 95.2% trigger efficiency on signal and background, the luminosity-dependent errors on the normalizations of the control samples (ignoring \(W+\)jets in the Control and b-tagged regions), and the systematic uncertainties

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c} \hline Region & Signal, \(M_{H}=170\) GeV (fb) & \(t\overline{t}\) & \(WW\) & \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) & \(W+\)jets \\ \hline Signal-like & 28.65\(\pm\)0.80 & 1.14\(\pm\)1.14 & 29.35\(\pm\)1.59 & \(<\)1.74 & 38\(\pm\)38 \\ Control & 1.47\(\pm\)0.27 & 5.71\(\pm\)2.55 & 61.13\(\pm\)2.33 & 4.06\(\pm\)1.53 & \(<\)114 \\ b-tagged & 0 & 6.85\(\pm\)2.80 & 0.11\(\pm\)0.09 & 1.16\(\pm\)0.82 & \(<\)114 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Cross-sections (in fb) after all cuts for a number-counting analysis with a test mass of \(M_{H}=170\) GeV in the \(H+0j\), \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) channel.

described above, the expected significance of the number-counting analysis (in the Gaussian approximation, for \(\int L\,dt=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) is \(8.5\sigma\). This figure ignores the error on the \(W\)+jets background prediction; in a future study, it will be important to normalize the \(W\)+jets background using data. In the interest of performing a meaningful comparison with the fit analysis, it is helpful to compute the significance ignoring the \(W\)+jets background altogether: \(10.4\sigma\). This is comparable to the result from the fit; if the contribution from the \(W\)+jets background is ignored there, the significance is \(8.8\sigma\) at the same luminosity.

## 6 Leptonic W Pair Production with Two Hard Jets

This Section presents the analysis of events where a \(W\) pair is produced in association with two hard jets and both \(W\) bosons decay leptonically. [29, 30, 31, 32] In Section 6.1, the main discriminators in this channel are reviewed. For background extraction and significance estimation, two complementary approaches are considered; both of them are fit-based. In Section 6.2, an analysis that uses a Neural Network to combine several jet variables into a single discriminator and fits the Neural Network output and \(M_{T}\) is presented. This method has the advantage that the correlations among variables related to jets (described in Section 6.1) are naturally taken into account by the Neural Network, and the weak correlations between the jet variables and the lepton variables are largely taken into account by the way the control sample is used in the fit. However, it has the disadvantage that the Neural Network must be trained ahead of time; in principle, this may introduce some model-dependence to the procedure. Ideally, one would like to directly model all kinematic variables in a maximum Likelihood fit; Section 6.3 describes an analysis that takes this approach with a fit of five kinematic variables. This method has the advantage that there is no training stage and therefore has the potential to be more model independent than the analysis of Section 6.2. However, because of the difficulty in constructing a fully correlated probability distribution for a 5-dimensional space, the probability distributions used in the fit of Section 6.3 include only the largest correlations among the kinematic variables and ignore some smaller correlations. It is possible to make some corrections to the shapes of the distributions to model correlations not inherently present in the fit model; Section 6.3 explores the prospects for extracting such corrections from b-tagged control samples. The combined significance estimate at the end of this note will be based on the analysis of Section 6.2, but further studies of both approaches are needed in order to converge on a final strategy for the analysis of real data.

### Handles for Suppressing the Top Background

In both of the fit-based approaches under study, \(t\bar{t}\) is the dominant background after the preselection cuts, and in both approaches, similar discriminators are used to suppress it. Two discriminators warrant special attention: jet kinematics, which is discussed in Section 6.1.1, and b-tagging, which is discussed in Section 6.1.2.

#### 6.1.1 Jet Kinematics

One of the main advantages of any search for a Higgs in association with two jets is the possibility to suppress QCD backgrounds with cuts on jet kinematics. The Vector Boson Fusion Higgs signal features several distinctive characteristics:

* The two jets arising from struck quarks (often referred to as "tag" jets) tend to be the highest-\(p_{T}\) jets in the event, and they tend to be well-separated in pseudorapidity;
* they tend to have a large invariant mass;
* there is very little jet activity in the region between the two tag jets.

Figure 5 shows the distributions of the pseudorapidity gap between the tag jets, their invariant mass, and the \(p_{T}\) of the third-highest \(p_{T}\) jet in the event. The figure also shows the distribution of the azimuthal angle between the tagjets, \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\). It is possible to enhance the discrimination against backgrounds with a cut on \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\), but in this study no such cut is applied on the grounds that this angle is needed in a measurement of the spin and CP properties of the Higgs boson [33].

Only one Higgs boson mass is shown for the signal process in Figure 5, but it is worth noting that the dependence of these variables on the Higgs boson mass is rather weak. It is also worth noting that Pythia 6.4 predicts a somewhat harder \(p_{T}\) spectrum for the third jet than Herwig and Sherpa do. This would amount to a difference as large as a few tens of percent in the survival probability if a jet veto cut were applied.

It has been shown in previous studies that hard cuts on the kinematic variables discussed here can provide a strong rejection against the top background [25, 34, 35]. As part of the present study, it has been checked that the high signal-to-background ratio that can be achieved in this channel is not sensitive to degradations arising from detector alignment effects.

#### 6.1.2 Rejecting Top with B-tagging

Another effective way to reject a significant fraction of the \(t\bar{t}\) events while retaining a high efficiency for the signal is to apply a veto on events containing jets with high \(b\)-tagging weights. The \(t\bar{t}\) events naturally

Figure 5: Pseudorapidity gap between tag jets (left top plot), invariant-mass distributions of tag jets (right top plot), azimuthal angle gap between tag jets (left bottom plot) and \(E_{t}\) of the third jet in VBF \(H\to WW\to\mu\nu\)\(\mu\nu\) Pythia events (m(H)=170 GeV). A requirement \(\eta_{1}\eta_{2}\leq\)0 is used in addition to the requirement jet \(E_{t}>20\) GeV.

contain two jets originating from \(b\)-quarks whereas the heavy flavor content in the signal events is limited at tree level to having \(c\) quarks in the tagging jets, and then typically in only one of the two tagging jets. This makes vetoing against events with more than one jet with high \(b\)-tagging weight especially efficient. Figure 6 shows the distribution of leading versus sub-leading jet weights in the events for signal (left plot) and the \(t\bar{t}\) background (right plot). The plots are divided in three regions: I where there is a non-default \(b\)-tagging weight for more than one jet, II where there is only \(b\)-tagging information for one jet in the event and III where there are no jets with \(b\)-tagging information in the event2). The fraction of events in each of the three regions is:

Footnote 2): Jets can lack \(b\)-tagging information if they fall outside the acceptance of the inner tracker, or because there are no tracks with high impact parameter significance in the jet.

* 38% of the events in region I, 48% of the events in region II and 14% of the events in region III for the Higgs signal.
* 85% of the events in region I, 14% of the events in region II and 0.5% of the events in region III for the \(t\bar{t}\) background.

The selection in the leading versus sub-leading jet weights plane was optimized for the highest increase in the number-counting significance after the following cuts have been applied:

* Two leptons, \(p_{T}>15\) GeV
* Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>30\) GeV
* At least two jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<4.8\)
* The two jets with highest transverse momentum are required to be in opposite hemispheres, with \(\Delta\eta(jet1,jet2)>3\)

Figure 6: The distribution of leading versus sub-leading jet weights in the events for signal (left plot) and the \(t\bar{t}\) background (right plot). The plots are divided in three regions: (I) where there is a non-default \(b\)-tagging weight for more than one jet, (II) where there is only \(b\)-tagging information for one jet in the event and (III) where there are no jets with \(b\)-tagging information in the event.

* Require that both leptons are between the two leading jets in pseudorapidity.

Two cuts are applied on the b-tagging weights:

* weight(jet1)+0.6\(\times\)weight(jet2)\(<\)3 for events in region I
* weight(jet1)\(<\)8 for events in region II

These cuts provide a strong rejection against the top background and a large acceptance for the Higgs signal.

### Two-dimensional Fit

To select the events that are used in the two-dimensional fit, the same preselection cuts that were described in the previous section are applied, plus two additional cuts:

* To reject backgrounds from \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\), assume that the leptons are coming from \(\tau\) decays and compute \(x_{\tau}^{1}\) and \(x_{\tau}^{2}\), the fractions of the tau energies carried by the visible leptons in the collinear approximation. If \(x_{\tau}^{1}\) and \(x_{\tau}^{2}\) are positive and \(M_{\tau\tau}\) is close to the \(Z\) mass (\(|M_{\tau\tau}-M_{Z}|<25\) GeV), the event is rejected.
* Require that the transverse mass \(M_{T}\) is between 50 GeV and 600 GeV, and that the transverse mass \(m_{T}^{ll\nu}\) (as defined in Ref. [25]) is at least 30 GeV.

In this analysis, electrons are selected using the standard ATLAS medium electron selection. The definition of muons, and the isolation cuts applied to both, are the same as in the \(H+0j\), \(H\rightarrow\ WW\rightarrow\ e\nu\mu\nu\) analysis in Section 5.

Events surviving the cuts above are used in the fit; they are partitioned into a signal box and a control region defined by additional cuts on the pseudorapidity gap between the leptons and the dilepton opening angle in the transverse plane. An event lies in the signal box if it has \(\Delta\phi_{ll}<1.5\) and \(\Delta\eta_{ll}<1.4\); otherwise, it lies in the control region. Table 5 shows the cross-sections for signal and background in these two regions.

The trigger efficiency has been studied in the context of this analysis. The same trigger menus as in the \(H+0j\), \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) analysis are used, and the results are similar: a trigger efficiency of 99.0% after Level 1, 96.8% after Level 2, and 94.5% after the Event Filter. These efficiencies are quite high, and

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c c c c c} \hline \hline Cut & Signal (170 GeV) & \(t\overline{t}\) & \(WW+\)jets & \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) & W+jets \\ \hline Lepton Selection & 30.20 & 8317 & 838.96 & (2096) & 1323 \\ Forward Jet Tagging & 17.27 & 946.6 & 32.77 & 79.30 & 31.83 \\ Leptons Between Jets & 16.47 & 617.8 & 22.92 & 55.13 & 27.91 \\ \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) Rejection & 15.68 & 561.8 & 21.20 & 39.03 & 27.91 \\ \(p_{T}^{miss}\), \(M_{T}\), \(m_{T}^{ll\nu}\) & 12.78 & 425.9 & 15.28 & 0 & 13.96 \\ b-veto & 12.67 & 206.72 & - & - & - \\ \hline signal box, b-jet Veto & 9.28\(\pm\)0.27 & 28.5\(\pm\)5.7 & 4.75\(\pm\)0.30 & - & 4.3\(\pm\)4.3 \\ signal box, no b-jet Veto & 9.65 & 114.2 & 4.99 & - & 6.07 \\ \hline Control, b-jet Veto & 3.02\(\pm\)0.15 & 89\(\pm\)10 & 9.78\(\pm\)0.43 & - & 7.9\(\pm\)5.0 \\ Control, no b-jet Veto & 3.13 & 311.7 & 10.28 & - & 7.89 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Cut flows (in fb) for \(M_{H}=170\) GeV in the \(H+2j\), \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) channel. Numbers in parentheses are affected by generator-level filter cuts.

as for the \(H+0j\) analysis, it has been checked that the trigger efficiency does not significantly change the shape of the most important kinematic variables. Table 5 does not include the trigger efficiency, but it is taken into account as an overall scale factor for signal and background when generating toy Monte Carlo to test the 2-dimensional fit described in the next section.

After the preselection described above, a four-variable Neural Network is used to further enhance the separation between the signal and the background. The inputs to the Neural Network are:

* \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\), the pseudorapidity gap between the tagjets
* \(M_{jj}\), the invariant mass of the tagjets
* \({p_{T}}^{veto}\), the transverse momentum of the leading non-tag jet in the region \(|\eta|<3.2\), and
* \(\eta^{*}=\eta_{3}-(\eta_{1}+\eta_{2})/2\), the pseudorapidity gap between the tag-tag system and the third jet. It is set to -9 if no third jet is present.

The Neural Network classifies events as signal-like if they have large \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\), large \(M_{jj}\), low \({p_{T}}^{veto}\), and large \(|\eta^{*}|\). Figure 7 shows the Neural Network output and transverse mass distributions in the signal box. The fit is a two-dimensional fit to these two quantities; both the signal model and the background model are uncorrelated product probability density functions (PDFs). The fit does not distinguish among the various types of background.

An in-situ normalization of fake backgrounds has not yet been implemented for this channel. For the present study, a static model has been used to approximate the fake background from \(W\)+jets. The same functional form used for the irreducible backgrounds was fitted to a set of \(W\)+jets Monte Carlo events that pass a loosened lepton selection, and its normalization was scaled to the cross-section obtained with the tighter selection cuts actually used in the analysis. In the present study, none of the parameters governing the shape or normalization of the fake background are allowed to float in the fit; systematic errors on the shape and normalization of the \(W\)+jets background are ignored.

The Neural Network output distribution for the background in the signal box is taken to be the same as the distribution in the control region, but it is multiplied by a linear extrapolation factor. Apart from

the slope of this extrapolation factor, all parameters governing the shape of the Neural Network output distribution in the two regions are required to be the same.

A check on the impact of altered jet energy scales on the Neural Network output distributions for signal and background has been performed; changing the jet energy scale by 5% in the region with tracking and 10% elsewhere does not change the Neural Network output shape in a meaningful way. This is not surprising, since the Neural Network inputs are slowly varying functions of the jet energy. Similarly, raising the jet \(p_{T}\) thresholds from 20 GeV to 30 or 40 GeV to mimic a degraded efficiency for low-\(p_{T}\) jets does not have a large impact on the ratio of the Neural Network output distributions in the signal box and the control regions.

Given the fact that the Neural Network output shape is insensitive to the jet energy scale, one would expect that the ratio of distributions in the signal box and control region would be insensitive to the jet energy scale as well. Other possible sources of uncertainty in the ratio of Neural Network output distributions are underlying event activity and the \(Q^{2}\) scale uncertainty; these sources of uncertainty have not been checked explicitly at this time. However, it is reasonable to think they might be small because the cuts on jets in the signal box are the same as in the control region and because the distributions of variables related to jets are not strongly correlated to the lepton angular variables. If the uncertainty in the ratio of distributions is sufficiently small, then one can fix the parameter governing the extrapolation factor; if it is too large, one must allow it to float in the fit. In the latter case, it may be possible to constrain it somewhat by looking into a b-tagged control sample; this possibility has been studied in the context of the five-dimensional fit discussed in the next section. All of these possibilities require further study in the context of the two-dimensional fit; this note will simply consider both scenarios: allowing the slope of the extrapolation factor to float in the fit and fixing it to a predetermined value taken from Monte Carlo. In both cases, it is assumed that the transverse mass distributions are well-predicted, and that the Neural Network output distribution is not; in practice this means that the \(M_{T}\) parameters are set to fixed values while most of the parameters describing the Neural Network output shape are allowed to float in the fit.

The expected significance is shown as a function of the true Higgs mass in Figure 8 for the two treatments of the extrapolation factor considered in this study. The sensitivity is comparable to what was quoted in previous studies of this channel, at least for the case where the extrapolation parameter is constrained to a fixed value.

### Five-dimensional Fit

A conceptually simpler but more technically challenging strategy is to directly fit the most important kinematic variables. This section describes such an approach to the \(H+2j\), \(H\to WW\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\) channel.

The selection cuts used in this analysis are similar to those used in section 6.2, with a few slight differences:

* Either two or three jets with transverse momentum \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<4.9\) are allowed.
* The missing transverse momentum \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is greater than \(20\) GeV.
* The pseudorapidity gap between the tagjets is required to satisfy \(|\Delta\eta_{jj}|>2.5\), and the invariant mass of the tagjets is required to lie in the range \(m_{jj}\in[600,3000]\) GeV.
* A \(b\)-tagged jet is defined as having a displaced vertex significance greater than 4.5.

The values of the Higgs boson mass, \(m_{H}\), and the cross section, \(\sigma(\mbox{\it VBF}\ H\to WW)\), are determined with an unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the distributions of \(x=(M_{T},\Delta\phi_{ll},\Delta\eta_{ll},\Delta\eta_{jj},m_{jj})\), as obtained from the selected data sample. A multidimensional kernel estimation technique [36] has been used to help model the kinematic distributions in the control samples.

Events in the selected data sample are divided into categories based on four properties: the flavors of the reconstructed lepton pair (\(\mu\mu\), \(\mu e\), and \(ee\)); the number of reconstructed good jets (2jet and 3jet); events with and without a \(b\)-tagged jet (btag and bveto, where a \(b\)-tagged jet is defined as having a displaced vertex significance greater than 4.5); and events that fall into the signal region,'sigbox', having \(|\Delta\phi_{ll}|<1.5\) and \(|\Delta\eta_{ll}|<1.4\), and those that fall outside, into the'sideband' region. The b-vetoed sigbox region is denoted as region 1, the b-vetoed sideband as region 2, the b-tagged sigbox region as region 3, and the b-tagged sideband region as region 4.

Most \(t\bar{t}\) background events contain a \(b\)-tagged jet, whereas most \(WW\) background events fall into the bveto category. The majority of Higgs boson events is expected to be found in physics region 1. Events outside of this region are not considered as signal candidates. These regions are defined to be the background control samples.

For \(t\bar{t}\), \(WW\), and \(H\to WW\) events, the selected samples are mostly dominated by di-leptonic \(W\) decays. For this reason, the relative fractions of \(\mu\mu\), \(ee\), and \(\mu e\) events (\(f_{\mu\mu}\), \(f_{ee}\), \(1-f_{\mu\mu}-f_{ee}\)) are taken to be identical for background and signal events.

The signal model is obtained from fully simulated Monte Carlo events, and is factorized into four shapes, modelling \(M_{T}\), \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\), \(\Delta\eta_{ll}\) and \((\Delta\eta_{jj},m_{jj})\) respectively. The signal shape is assumed to be independent of the lepton pair category and the number of good jets per event.

The Higgs boson transverse mass distribution, \(M_{T}\), is described with a double-sided exponential, having two different lifetimes, convoluted with a Gaussian. The mean of the Gaussian is interpreted as the Higgs boson mass, \(m_{H}\), and is left free in the fit. The left-handed lifetime, \(\tau_{L}\), comes from the missing \(z\)-component in the transverse mass calculation. The parameter \(\tau_{L}\) is a linear function of \(m_{H}\), and equals \(25\) GeV for a Higgs boson mass of \(130\) GeV, and \(45\) GeV for a Higgs boson mass of \(170\) GeV. The right-handed component, \(\tau_{R}\), is the result of the non-validity of the approximation \(m_{ll}=m_{\nu\bar{\nu}}\) in the definition of \(M_{T}\), and is fixed to \(20\) GeV for all Higgs boson masses. The width of the Gaussian, \(\sigma_{MET}\), is interpreted as the resolution on the missing transverse energy, and is fixed to \(15\) GeV.

The distributions of \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) and \(\Delta\eta_{ll}\) in signal are described with single Gaussians, with means fixed to zero, and widths of \(\sigma_{\Delta\phi}=1.09\) and \(\sigma_{\Delta\eta}=0.62\) respectively.

The tagging jet observables \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\) and \(m_{jj}\) in signal are strongly correlated, and are modeled with a 2-dimensional (2D) kernel estimation function.

For these observables, the largest unmodelled correlation is between \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) and \(\Delta\eta_{ll}\), and is found to be 14% from the available signal Monte Carlo sample.

The collection of background events in regions 2-4 serves as a data control sample for the determination of: a) the probability density functions, and b) the number of background candidates in physics region 1. The background shape is assumed to be independent of the lepton pair category and number of good jets per event. The shape is factorized into two pieces, describing \((M_{T},\Delta\phi_{ll},\Delta\eta_{ll})\) and \((\Delta\eta_{jj},m_{jj})\) respectively.

The background distribution of \((M_{T},\Delta\phi_{ll},\Delta\eta_{ll})\) - observables mostly independent of the jet characteristics - is modelled with a 3D kernel estimation function, using the events in physics region 3. A small efficiency correction is applied to the observable \(M_{T}\), calculated as the ratio the distributions of \(M_{T}\) in physics regions 2 and 4, both determined using 1D kernel estimation functions.

Accounting for the hard \(p_{T}\) spectrum of the \(b\)-tagged jet sample, the distribution of \((\Delta\eta_{jj},m_{jj})\) is modelled with a 2D kernel estimation function using the background events in physics region 2. A correction function is applied to \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\), determined as the ratio the \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\) distributions in physics regions 3 and 4, again determined using 1D kernel estimation functions.

The unmodelled correlations between these observables are found to be smaller than 10%, as obtained from the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(WW\) background Monte Carlo samples.

The number of background events in physics region 1 is partially estimated from the number of background events in categories 2-4. For this we assume the ratio of events in the sideband to sigbox regions (\(f_{\rm sigbox-sideband}\)) to be identical for the btag and bveto categories. Given the ratio of events of physics regions 2 and 4 (\(f_{\rm bveto-btag}\)), determined independently for the 2jet and 3jet samples, estimates for the number of background events in physics region 1 can be obtained. These estimates are expressed as the total number of background events, \(n_{\rm bkg}\), and the relative fraction of background event in the 3jet category, \(f_{\rm bkg-3j}\).

Finally, the fitted number of Higgs boson signal events, \(n_{H}\), is determined seperately for the 2jet and 3jet categories.

#### 6.3.1 Toy Monte Carlo Studies

A fit example to approximately 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of fully simulated Monte Carlo events, including Higgs boson signal events with a mass of 170 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\), is demonstrated in the left side of Fig. 9. The plot shows the events in the defined physics region 1, with the total and background fit projections overlaid. Here the signal shape has been obtained from fully simulated Monte Carlo events. The background probability density function has been obtained using kernel estimation from the (Monte Carlo) events in the background control samples.

The corresponding fit results are given in Table 6. The Higgs boson mass found is consistent with the generated value. The total numbers of Higgs boson and background events found are consistent with the input values of 27 and 86 respectively. The fit is most sensitive to Higgs boson events in the 2jet signal region - where most Higgs boson events are expected, and contributions from \(t\bar{t}\) background events are minimal. For Higgs boson masses in the range \([160,170]\)\(\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the signal to background ratio is this category is approximately \(1:1\). The error on the fitted number of background events in the signal region is found to be 7.4. When not including the estimated number of background event from the background control samples in the fit, the error on the number fitted number of background events doubles. The error on the fitted number of Higgs boson events rises by 25%, and the correlation of the fitted number of Higgs boson events with all other fit parameters - mostly correlated to the number of background events - rises from 25% to 45%. The correlation of the Higgs boson mass with all other fit parameters is 12%.

The statistical properties of this fitting algorithm have been studied with about 15k toy Monte Carlo outcomes like the one discussed in the previous paragraph. The toy outcomes have been generated with the same number of events seen in, and the shapes obtained from, the fully simulated Monte Carlo signal and background samples remnant after the event selection, corresponding to 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The mass of the generated Higgs boson sample is varied between 110 and 200 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\), in steps of 10 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The Higgs boson cross-section is adjusted accordingly [1]. The fit algorithm described above has been performed on each generated pseudo-experiment.

The fitted number of Higgs boson events in the 2jet signal region - most sensitive to the Higgs signal - shows an average bias of less than 0.8 event over the entire generated mass range. Roughly 12 Higgs boson events are needed in this region before a clear signal peak can be picked up by the fitter. The error on the fitted number of 2jet Higgs boson events varies between 3.1 and 5.6 events for no generated Higgs boson events to the maximum cross-section between 160 and 170 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) respectively.

The average fit error on the Higgs boson mass parameter is about 14.0 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in background-only outcomes, or about 9.4 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) in outcomes containing both background and a 160 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\) Higgs signal with cross-section as given by the Standard Model. In Fig. 9, note that the background distribution, dominated by \(t\bar{t}\) events, peaks at around 160 \(\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Pseudo-experiments with no generated signal events tend to peak at this mass, where statistical fluctuations are largest. For 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) samples, starting from the generated

Higgs boson mass of 110 GeV with a value of \(+1\sigma\), the fit show a decreasing bias in the mass pull distribution, which is consistent with zero at 160 GeV, and becomes \(-1\sigma\) at 200 GeV. The width of the pull is consistent with one in the generated mass range of \([150,190]\) GeV, and grows for lower cross-section, upto 1.7\(\sigma\) at 120 GeV.

The average statistical sensitivity derived from the toy Monte Carlo study is shown in the right side of Figure 9. At 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, the sensitivity to \(V\!BF\)\(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\to l^{+}\nu\,l^{-}\bar{\nu}\) decays is greater than one for Higgs boson masses greater than 120 GeV. (Below 120 GeV the \(H\to W^{+}W^{-}\) branching ratio becomes too small for this measurement to be effective.) It reaches a maximum of 2.5\(\sigma\) at the Higgs boson mass of 160 GeV.

## 7 W Pair Production with Two Hard Jets in the Lepton-Hadron Channel

This section describes the analysis of events where the \(W\) pair is produced in association with two hard jets and one \(W\) boson decays leptonically (with the other \(W\) decaying to jets). [25, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43] The dominant backgrounds to this final state are \(W\)+jets and \(t\overline{t}\) production; it is possible that QCD multijets will also play an important role. Because of the large jet multiplicity, there are large theoretical uncertainties in the predicted normalization of the backgrounds, especially for \(W\)+jets and QCD multijets. Therefore, this section will emphasize studies of the signal, the \(W\)+jets background, and the \(t\overline{t}\) background, with discussion of how to normalize the backgrounds given data. Quantitative predictions of the discovery sensitivity will not be included here.

Because there is only one neutrino in the final state, this channel permits a better estimate of the Higgs candidate invariant mass than the dilepton channels. Taken together with the large sensitivity of the dilepton channels for Higgs masses near 160 GeV, this means that the \(H\to WW\to l\nu qq\) channel is most interesting for the study of Higgs bosons with masses in excess of roughly 250-300 GeV.

The most obvious way to estimate the invariant mass of a \(H\to WW\to\ell\nu qq\) candidate is to assume that both \(W\) bosons are on-shell. One can then use the \(W\) mass constraint for the \(W\to\ell\nu\) system to estimate the \(z\) momentum of the neutrino.3)

Footnote 3: The \(W\) mass constraint yields a quadratic equation which can have 0, 1, or 2 real solutions. If there are two solutions, the one with smaller \(|p_{z}^{\nu}|\) is used; if there is no real solution, the imaginary term is ignored and only the real part is used.

The analysis of this channel uses reconstructed jets to measure the invariant masses of Higgs boson candidates; it is therefore necessary to consider out-of-cone corrections to the jet energies that were not important in the dilepton channels. Eventually, these corrections should be taken from real data; however, such a study has not yet been performed. For the present study, the out-of-cone correction from ATLFAST-B [43] has been applied to all jets. After applying this correction to the reconstructed jet momenta, the following cuts are applied:

* Leptonic \(W\) selection. The event must contain exactly one hard lepton, with transverse momentum \(p_{T}>25\) GeV for electrons and \(p_{T}>20\) GeV for muons. It is also required that the missing transverse momentum, \(p_{T}{}^{miss}\), be larger than 30 GeV.
* Hadronic \(W\) selection. Out of all jets with large transverse momentum, \(p_{T}>30\) GeV, the two whose invariant mass is closest to the known value of the \(W\) mass are selected. It is required that the reconstructed invariant mass of these two jets be between 64 GeV and 90 GeV.
* Forward Jet Tagging. Select the two jets (excluding those from the \(W\) decay) that have the highest transverse momentum. These are labelled as the "tagging" jets; by construction, they are disjoint from the jets that form the \(W\to qq\) candidate. Require that they be high-\(p_{T}\) (\(p_{T}{}^{j1}>50\) GeV, \(p_{T}{}^{j2}>30\) GeV), that they lie in opposite hemispheres (\(\eta_{j1}\cdot\eta_{j2}<0\)), and that they be well-separated in pseudorapidity (\(|\eta_{j1}-\eta_{j2}|>4.4\)).

* Require that the lepton be between the tagjets in pseudorapidity.
* \(M_{jj}\): require that the invariant mass of the two tagging jets be greater than 1500.
* Central Jet Veto: reject the event if it contains any extra jets (in addition to the two jets from the decay of the \(W\) and the two tagging jets) with \(p_{T}>30\) and \(|\eta|<3.2\).
* b-jet veto: apply the b-jet veto cuts described in Section 6.1.2.
* \(\Delta\eta_{jj,1,t}\): require that the pseudorapidity gap between the leading jet from the decay of the \(W\) and the lepton be no larger than 1.5.
* Reconstruct the mass of the Higgs boson candidate, \(M_{l\nu qq}\), by applying the \(W\) mass constraint to the lepton-\({p_{T}}^{miss}\) system. The resolution is enhanced by performing a kinematic fit to the mass of the hadronically decaying \(W\), minimizing the function \(\chi^{2}=(M_{W}^{rec}-M_{W}^{true})/\Gamma_{W}+(\Delta E_{j1})^{2}/\sigma_{j1}^ {2}+(\Delta E_{j2})^{2}/\sigma_{j2}\), where \(\sigma\), the energy resolution for the jets, is given for now by the parameterization used in ATLFAST, \(\sigma/E_{j}=0.03\oplus 0.5/\sqrt{E_{j}/\ \mathrm{GeV}}\). The left plot in Figure 10 shows the distribution of the Higgs boson candidate invariant mass after all cuts for a representative Higgs boson mass of 300. The figure includes the mass peak obtained in a few distorted scenarios.

Table 7 shows the cut flow for \(W\)+jets, for \(t\overline{t}\), and for signal at a representative Higgs boson mass of 300. At the time of this writing, a detailed estimate of the background from QCD multijet events is not available.

The trigger efficiency for this channel has been estimated, considering only the single-lepton triggers: EM25I, EM60, MU20, and MU40 at Level 1; e25i, e60, and mu20i for Level 2 and the Event Filter. Table 8 shows the trigger efficiency for signal (\(M_{H}=170\)) events that pass the offline cuts. Because the present analysis relies only on single-lepton triggers, the trigger efficiency for this channel is not as

high as for the two-lepton channels. However, it has been checked that the trigger efficiency does not distort the \(M_{l\nu qq}\) shape for signal in a meaningful way. At the time of this writing, the trigger efficiency for the backgrounds has not been explicitly computed; in Table 7, the trigger efficiency for background is assumed to be the same as the trigger efficiency for signal.

The control sample for this channel is a region with loosened cuts on \(\Delta\eta_{jj}\) and \(M_{jj}\). In particular, the event selection is the same as in the signal-like region, except that the pseudorapidity gap between the tagjets is required to be less than 4 instead of larger than 4.4, and the lower bound on the invariant mass of the tagjets is lowered to 500 GeV. Table 7 shows the contributions from the various subprocesses after these cuts are applied. Since both the signal-like region and the control region have a nontrivial contribution from top events, it is necessary to define b-tagged control samples to normalize the top background. These samples have the same kinematic cuts as the signal-like and control regions, but the b-veto cut is reversed. The cross-sections in these two regions are also shown in the table.

The shape of the \(W\)+jets background in the signal-like region is the same as the \(W\)+jets background in the control region to within the available Monte Carlo statistics. Likewise, the top background in the b-tagged region with the same kinematic cuts as the signal-like region has the same shape as the top background in the b-vetoed signal-like region. In fast simulation, there is a small difference between the top background shapes in the control region and the b-tagged region with the same kinematic cuts as the control region, but that distortion is small compared to the statistical errors expected at the luminosities considered here. These statements are robust against a variety of systematic uncertainties, namely changes in the \(Q^{2}\) scale (a factor of 4 up and down for both top and \(W\)+jets) as well as altered jet energy scales (\(\pm\)5% in the region with tracking, \(\pm\)10% elsewhere), degraded jet energy resolution (Gaussian smearing to roughly double the resolution), degraded \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution (modeled by smearing the \(x\) and \(y\) components of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) by 5 GeV each), and \(E_{T}^{miss}\) reconstruction that has been degraded by artificially inducing a shift of 3% in the reconstructed \(E_{T}^{miss}\).

The background is normalized and the signal extracted with the help of a fitting algorithm which implements a simultaneous binned fit in the signal-like region and the main control region in the range 167\(<M_{l\nu qq}<\)1000 GeV. The fit proceeds in two steps: first, standalone fits of the top background model to the b-tagged regions are performed. All parameters governing the shape of the top background distributions are allowed to float in this fit. After the fits to the b-tagged regions, these parameters are fixed, and the histograms are rescaled by the ratio of cross-sections in the b-tagged and b-vetoed regions to obtain estimates of the top background normalization and shape in both b-vetoed regions.

The main fit is a simultaneous fit of the \(M_{l\nu qq}\) distribution in the signal-like and control regions. All shape parameters for the \(W\)+jets background are free to float in the fit, but the parameters governing the top background shape and normalization remain fixed. The \(W\)+jets background shape is assumed to be the same in the signal-like region and the control region, but the normalizations in the two regions are independent. Likewise, the signal shape is assumed to be the same in both regions, but the ratio of signal cross-sections is parameterized as a function of Higgs boson mass based on Monte Carlo. Figure 10 shows the result of an example fit to a toy Monte Carlo outcome with a true Higgs boson mass of 300 GeV.

The performance of the fitting algorithm has been evaluated by generating pseudo-experimental outcomes corresponding to a luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) with and without true signal events. However, because of the large theoretical uncertainty in the prediction of the \(W\)+jets background and the lack of a precise estimate of the QCD multijet background, an estimate of the expected significance is omitted here.

## 8 Conclusions

The prospects for a search for a Standard Model Higgs boson in the \(WW\) decay mode have been studied, using a realistic model of the ATLAS detector, including effects such as trigger efficiencies, backgrounds from fakes, and realistic misalignments. Three channels have been considered: \(H+0\,j\) with \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\), \(H+2j\) with \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\), and \(H+2\,j\) with \(H\to\ell\nu qq\). In-situ background normalization techniques for all three channels have been proposed, and their effectiveness and robustness has been demonstrated with detailed toy Monte Carlo studies.

The \(H+0\,j\), \(H\to e\nu\mu\nu\) channel is very promising for Higgs boson masses in the region around the \(WW\) threshold. For other masses, this channel is still very promising, but the analysis is more difficult because of large systematic uncertainties in the background prediction. It has been shown that these uncertainties can be controlled, and that the background can be normalized, with a two-dimensional fit in the transverse mass and the \(p_{T}\) of the \(WW\) system. With 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, one would expect to be able to reach a \(5\sigma\) discovery with the \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) channel alone if there is a Standard Model Higgs with a mass between \(\sim 140\) and \(\sim 185\). A measurement of the mass of the Higgs boson at this luminosity would have a precision of less than 2 GeV for a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass of 160 GeV, or a precision of less than 4 GeV for a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass of 140 GeV.

The \(H+2\,j\), \(H\to e\nu\mu\nu\) channel has a smaller event rate than the \(H+0\,j\) channel but a similar significance. With 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, one would expect to be able to reach a \(5\sigma\) discovery in the \(H\to WW\to e\nu\mu\nu\) channel alone if there is a Standard Model Higgs boson with a mass between 150 GeV and 180 GeV. A measurement of the Standard Model Higgs boson mass at this luminosity would typically return a precision less than \(\sim\)4-5 GeV if the Higgs boson mass is 160 GeV, or less than 8 GeV if the Higgs boson mass is 140 GeV.

Figure 10: Left: the reconstructed invariant mass of the \(M_{\nu qq}\) system for fully simulated signal Monte Carlo events with a true Higgs boson mass of 300 GeV. The red dashed and black dotted curves show the mass peaks obtained when the jet energy scale is raised and lowered by 7% in the region with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and 15% elsewhere. The blue dot-dashed curve shows the result obtained when the jet energy resolution is smeared by \(45\%/\sqrt{E}\) in the region with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(63\%/\sqrt{E}\) elsewhere. Middle: A toy Monte Carlo outcome corresponding to 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity for the signal-like region of the \(H+2\,j\), \(H\to l\nu qq\) analysis described in Section 7. Here, the background from QCD multijets is assumed to be negligible. Right: the corresponding distribution in the control region.

In the range below \(M_{H}=200\) GeV, both of the dilepton channels are important; it is therefore interesting to consider a combined fit of the two. In the combined fit, a shared mass parameter has been used for the two channels, but the signal normalizations have been allowed to float independently to preserve model-independence. Figure 11 shows the linearity of the mass determination and the expected significance of a combined fit of the two dilepton channels as a function of the true Higgs boson mass. As in the other linearity plots in this note, the green band represents the width of a gaussian fit to the region around the peak of the best-fit mass distribution and the error bars show the median fit error. The combined significance for a Standard Model Higgs is above the \(5\sigma\) level for \(M_{H}\) larger than about 140 GeV.

The \(H+2j\), \(H\to\ell\nu qq\) channel is most interesting for Higgs masses above \(\sim 250\) GeV. It has been shown that the background normalization can be estimated from data, but it is difficult to make a strong statement about the discovery potential of this analysis until a measurement of the \(W\)+4 jets background can be obtained from first data.
