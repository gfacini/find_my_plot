**Abstract**

Prospect of measuring the spin density element, \(\rho_{00}\), of the \(Z\) boson in \(q\overline{q}\to ZZ\to 4\) leptons (muons and electrons) events in ATLAS is presented. This is done through reconstructing the decay angle of the leptons in the \(Z\) rest frame. The fraction of the longitudinal polarized \(Z\)'s is extracted from the angular distribution. The errors presented correspond to an integrated luminosity of a 100fb\({}^{-1}\). The final error on the prospect measurement includes the error due to detector correction and also to some systematics uncertainties due to the proton structure function.

Introduction

The production of \(ZZ\) events has precise prediction in the Standard Model(SM) through quarks scattering. These predictions concern not only the total cross section but also the polarization of the \(Z\)'s produced and their dependence on the centre of mass energy. In LHC there is a unique opportunity to observe the longitudinal polarization of the \(Z\) which was not available for example at LEP2 due to poor statistics. Data and MC comparison of the \(Z\) polarization states will be important for reassuring that this interaction is well understood in the SM.

The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the theoretical framework and motivation for the study. In section 3 the event generation and software are discussed. Section 4 presents the event selection and proposed measurement technique. The systematic uncertainties are discussed in section 6 and the results are presented in section 7.

## 2 Theoretical Framework

### The \(q\overline{q}\to ZZ\) differential distribution

The differential cross section for \(ZZ\) production is given by[1],

\[\frac{d\sigma}{dt}=\frac{2\cdot\pi\alpha^{2}((g_{V}^{i})^{4}+(g_{A}^{i})^{4}+ 6(g_{V}^{i})^{2}(g_{A}^{i})^{2})}{s^{2}e^{4}}(\frac{t}{u}+\frac{u}{t}+\frac{4M _{Z}^{2}s}{ut}-M_{Z}^{4}(\frac{1}{t^{2}}+\frac{1}{u^{2}})), \tag{1}\]

where \(s,t,u\) are the Mandelstam variables for the reaction \(q_{i}\overline{q_{i}}\to ZZ\) and \(i\) corresponds to the quark flavour. The above expression is a sum over all the polarization states of the produced \(ZZ\). It includes the transverse (T) and longitudinal (L) polarization states and the sum is over the TT, TL and LL states. One can note that the at high energy and high momentum transfer the terms involving the mass of the \(Z\) become less important and the dominant contribution is due to the \(t/u+u/t\) terms. This corresponds to the state where the two \(Z\)'s are transversely polarized. The above expression does not include the width of the \(Z\) and therefore is not accurate at relatively low energies around the \(ZZ\) threshold.

Due to limited statistics it would not be possible to make a full study of the spin states of the \(ZZ\), and we consider only the single \(Z\) spin analysis.

The differential cross section to produce transverse and longitudinal polarized \(Z\) are given in terms of the spin density matrix (SDM) elements by,

\[\frac{d\sigma_{L}}{d\cos\theta_{Z}}=\rho_{00}(s,\cos\theta_{Z})\cdot\frac{d \sigma}{d\cos\theta_{Z}}, \tag{2}\]

\[\frac{d\sigma_{T}}{d\cos\theta_{Z}}=(\rho_{++}(s,\cos\theta_{Z})+\rho_{--}(s, \cos\theta_{Z}))\cdot\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_{Z}}, \tag{3}\]

where \(\rho_{++}\), \(\rho_{--}\), \(\rho_{00}\) are the diagonal elements of the SDM and \(\theta_{Z}\) is the \(Z\) production angle. \(\theta_{Z}\) is defined in figure 1. The diagonal elements satisfy the condition: \(\sum\rho_{\tau\tau^{\prime}}=1\). It is possible to extract these diagonal elements from the differential distribution of the fermions in the rest frame of the decaying \(Z\). Assuming spin 1 decay into 2 spin half fermions, the expected angular distribution for massless fermions in the rest frame of the parent \(Z\) is given in terms of the diagonal elements of the SDM[2] by,

\[\frac{1}{\sigma}\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_{f}}=(\rho_{T})\frac{3}{8}(1+\cos^{ 2}\theta_{f})+\rho_{00}\frac{3}{4}\sin^{2}\theta_{f}. \tag{4}\]

where the fermion decay angle, \(\theta_{f}\), is defined in figure 1 and \(\rho_{T}\) is the transverse diagonal element assuming \(\rho_{++}\) = \(\rho_{--}\) = \(\rho_{T}\). In general, it is possible to extract the different \(\rho_{\tau\tau^{\prime}}\) values by constructing projection operators, \(\Lambda_{\tau\tau^{\prime}}\), which satisfy,

\[\rho_{\tau\tau^{\prime}}^{Z}(s,\cos\theta_{Z})=\frac{\int\frac{d^{3}\sigma}{d \cos\theta_{Z}d\cos\theta_{f}d\phi_{f}}\cdot\Lambda_{\tau\tau^{\prime}}(\cos_ {f})d\cos\theta_{f}d\phi_{f}}{\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta_{Z}}}. \tag{5}\]

The projection operators for the diagonal SDM elements are given below[3],\[\Lambda_{T}=\Lambda_{--}+\Lambda_{++}=\frac{1}{2}(10\cos^{2}\theta_{f}-2), \tag{6}\]

\[\Lambda_{00}=2-5\cos^{2}\theta_{f}. \tag{7}\]

In this technique each event gets a weight for the \(Z\) being longitudinal or transverse depending on the fermion decay angle. By summing the weights given by each projection operator over the total number of events and dividing by the total of the different polarization weights, the polarization fractions may be obtained.

## 3 Event Generation

Samples of simulated data events of \(q\overline{q}\) producing two \(Z\)'s in the final state were generated using the Pythia MC generator version 10.0.1 of Athena for the simulation.

In order to evaluate the significance of possible background sources MC samples for \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Zb\overline{b}\) events were produced using Pythia and the Acer MC respectively.

The generated MC samples were processed by the full ATLAS simulation program and then reconstructed as expected for real data.

## 4 Measurement of the \(Z\) boson spin states

### Event selection

The process of \(ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\), \(l=e,\mu\), provides a very clean signal. The possible background sources are \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Zb\overline{b}\) events, both of which can contain four leptons in the final state. However, the requirement that the pair of leptons invariant mass be close to the \(Z\) mass removes both of these backgrounds to negligible levels, of less than 1%. This mass cut also removes the \(Z\rightarrow\tau\overline{\tau}\) background, as in this case the electron or muon coming from the \(\tau\) will be much less energetic and will not add up to give the full \(Z\) mass. The signal selection proceeds by requiring the event to have four identified isolated leptons. The full list of cuts applied are presented in table 1. The \(P_{T}\) and rapidity cuts are motivated by the ATLAS detector acceptance[6].

### Measurement technique

As shown in equation 5, the values of the different SDM elements, \(\rho_{\tau\tau^{\prime}}\) depend on \(s\) and on the production angle of the \(Z\). In \(q\overline{q}\) scattering from proton-proton interactions, the value of \(\sqrt{s}\) varies over a significant range. Therefore, there is a unique opportunity to study the dependence of the different \(\rho_{\tau\tau^{\prime}}\) on \(\sqrt{s}\). According to MC, the dependence of the \(\rho_{\tau\tau^{\prime}}\) on the \(Z\) production angle is quite weak and therefore was not studied in this analysis.

The events were divided into four bins in \(\sqrt{s}\), such there is a variation in the theoretical value for \(\rho_{00}\) and adequate statistics in each bin according to the MC. The \(Z\) decay angle distribution changes considerably from bin to bin. This is shown in figure 2 where \(\cos_{f}\) is presented. The width of the \(\sqrt{s}\) bins is also shown. The variation in the shape of the distribution from bin to bin reflects the different polarization in each of the \(\sqrt{s}\) bins considered.

In each energy bin the statistical estimator of the SDM element is

\[\rho_{\tau\tau^{\prime}}^{Z}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i}^{N}\Lambda_{\tau\tau^{\prime}} ^{(i)}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|r|c|} \hline Transverse lepton momentum & \(P_{T}>7\) \\ \hline Lepton rapidity & \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline \(Z\) mass constraint & \(|M_{ll}-91.2|<12\) GeV \\ \hline At least 2 leptons with & \(P_{T}>20\) GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The cuts applied for \(q\overline{q}\to ZZ\) selection.

where the sum is over all the events. The estimators were not explicitly constrained to lie between 0 and 1, and hence could have unphysical values due to fluctuations in the data.

### Detector Correction

The aim of this study is to measure the true value of \(\rho_{\tau\tau^{\prime}}\) and compare it to the SM value. Therefore, any detector effects on the measurement should be corrected for. The \(P_{T}\) and rapidity cuts summarized in table 1, will reject some of the relatively low \(\sqrt{s}\) events in the original sample and therefore, will have an affect on the measured value of \(\rho\). This effect has to be corrected for.

In order to find the correction factor, the angular distribution of the leptons in the rest frame of the \(Z\) was compared before and after the detector. Since the correction depends on the angle, the sample was divided into 10 bins in \(|\cos_{f}|\). The detector correction(\(det_{cor}\)) for angular bin \(i\) was given by \(det^{i}_{cor}=\frac{N^{i}_{gen}}{N^{i}_{mes}}\). where \(N^{i}_{gen}\) and \(N^{i}_{mes}\) are the number of events in bin \(i\) before and after the detector. As the measurement is done in four bins of \(\sqrt{s}\), this procedure was done in each of the bins separately. The values of the detector corrections for each of the energy bins are shown in table 2. One can see that the largest correction is in the low energy bin where the selection cuts have the largest effect.

## 5 Systematics

A central role of MC in this analysis is to correct for the \(\cos\theta\) distribution of the decaying lepton in the \(Z\) rest frame due to the cuts made for signal selection (shown in table 1). Therefore it was necessary to consider systematic effects on this correction. The uncertainties on this correction may come from MC statistics and the choice of the proton structure function. The error on the MC statistics was computed by considering the statistical error in each angular bin before and after the detector simulation and cuts are introduced and than combining them in quadrature.

The uncertainties due to the proton structure function were evaluated by calculating the correction factor for a set of five structure functions as listed in table 3. This new correction was used to extract a new value for \(\rho_{00}\) and the systematics error was obtained from the difference between this value and the value with the nominal MC structure function. Table 3 summarizes the systematic uncertainties on the angular correction.

## 6 Results

Table 4 shows the fraction of longitudinally polarized \(Z\) bosons measured for each \(\sqrt{s}\) bin using'simulated data' of 100fb\({}^{-1}\). The values have been corrected for the detector effects as described in section 4.3. For comparison the true MC values are shown. The errors on the'simulated data' shows the expected sensitivity of the measurement. These results are also shown in figure 7.

## 7 Conclusions

It was shown that it would be possible to measure the SDM element \(\rho_{00}\) with luminosity of a 100fb\({}^{-1}\). This may be done in bins of \(\sqrt{s}\) which will be interesting for a detailed study of this process. The errors evaluated for this measurement may be reduced by having larger MC samples that will allow to reduce the error on the correction made to the measurement due to the selection cuts.
