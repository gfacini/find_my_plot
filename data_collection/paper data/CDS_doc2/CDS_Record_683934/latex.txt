Introduction

The challenge of the EM accordion calorimeter is to measure the energy of electromagnetic showers with a global constant term of about \(C_{tot}\sim 0.5^{\prime}_{bo}\) as quoted in [1]. As previously shown in [2], the lead plates actually put in the ATLAS accordion calorimeter have a thickness which can fluctuate around the nominal value within a range \(\pm 0.6\%\) of the nominal value. These fluctuations lead to an increase of the energy constant term as studied in [3]. This contribution has to be smaller than \(0.3\,\%\) if we want to be able to study the channel \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) and have a chance to discover a very light Higgs boson.

In order to reduce the effects of lead thickness fluctuation on the energy resolution, a pairing process based on the fact that an electromagnetic shower deposits its energy within \(5\,\)lead plates has been developped. This procedure reduces by almost a factor two the contribution to the constant term coming from lead thickness inhomogeneities. Nevertheless, the produced modules have a residual plate to plate thickness fluctuation.

The ideas and the method presented below intend to show that this residual effect on the constant term can be highly reduced from the knowledge of lead plate thicknesses measured in the hall IN2P3 at Orsay during the construction process.

## 2 Principles of the correction method

The leading idea is to take into account two basic physical effects :

* Five plates are seen by a single electromagnetic shower,
* the signal loss due to an increase by \(1\%\) of the lead thickness is respectively \(0.59\%/0.47\%\) of the nominal signal for a nominal lead thickness of \(1.53\) mm/\(1.13\) mm.

The last statement is coming from the simulation of the EM barrel Module \(0\) made in Paris [4]. We have dedicated a special production of \(4050\) simulated EM showers with a "perfect" module but with a lead thickness \(1\%\) uniformely above the nominal value. "Perfect" module is to be understood as a module with no fluctuation at all in its mechanics structure i.e. every absorber is the same, every gap is the same, every cell sees the same high voltage, etc... We have used \(4050\) showers initiated by \(50\)\(GeV\) electrons in that configuration and \(4050\) other coming from a simulation of a perfect module with the nominal lead thickness \(1.5mm\). These electrons have been shot at \(\eta=0.3\) and in the \(\phi\) range \([0.1;0.3]\). Figure (2) shows the reconstructed energy in both cases. Using the mean values of the distributions or the mean values coming from a gaussian fit made on these distributions lead to an estimation of the energy loss of \(\epsilon_{A}=-0.59\%\pm 0.01\%\).

The same study has also been done in the 1.13 mm lead thickness part at \(\eta=1.1\) as shown figure (2) showing in that region a weaker dependance \(\epsilon_{B}=-0.44\%\pm 0.01\%\).

The available information that we can use to correct the lead fluctuation effect is a precise measurement of lead plates which is available as a map of about \(70\times 15\) points per absorber.

The method applied to correct for lead thickness fluctuation has three steps :

1. the local lead thickness averaged over 5 plates is computed,
2. the obtained distribution is normalised to the nominal value,
3. the correction function is computed taking into account the local difference between the lead thickness and the nominal value.

## 3 Construction of the correction function

In order to study the power of this correction procedure, we have used a set of simulation files with 4050 50 GeV electrons interacting in a module with a determined lead plate distribution shown in figure (3.a) corresponding to a flat distribution with a relative width \(\frac{\Delta e}{e_{0}}=10\%\) where \(e_{0}=1.53\) mm is the nominal thickness.

This very large fluctuation has been made in order to have a very large effect on the recontructed energy distribution. All the electrons have been generated at a fixed \(\eta=0.3\) and in the \(\phi\) range [0.1;0.3] to avoid energy leakage due to the fact that we have a single module in the simulation.

The reconstructed energy fluctuation induced by this lead thickness distribution is shown in figure (4.a) as a function of the generated \(\phi\) angle of the electrons.

Figure 3: (a) Plot of lead plate thickness put in the simulation versus \(\phi\) (\(\phi_{n}=\frac{2\pi}{102\,4}*n\) where \(n\) is the plate indice in the module ; \(n\in[1,64]\)) in the calorimeter, (b) Plot of mean lead plate thickness over 5 plates (computed as explained in the text) versus \(n\), (c) correction function versus \(\phi\)

We construct the correction function following 4 steps :

1. We define an array \(e(n)\) (n=1,..,64) containing all the individual lead plate thicknesses
2. From \(e(n)\), an array \(\overline{e}^{(5)}(n)\) of the mean thickness over 5 plates is computed using a dedicated weighting for each of the 5 plates using the formula : \[\overline{e}^{(5)}(n)=\frac{\sum_{i=n-2}^{n+2}w_{i}\ e(i)}{\sum_{i=n-2}^{n+2}w_{i}}\]

Figure 4: (a) Scatter plot of the reconstructed energy versus \(\phi_{gen}\) for 50 GeV electrons (b) Scatter plot of the corrected reconstructed energy versus \(\phi_{gen}\) for 50 GeV electrons

with 3 options (if \(n\pm i\) (with \(i=1,2\)) is not in the range \([1,64],\,w_{i}=0\)):

* \(w_{n-2}=0,\,w_{n-1}=0,\,w_{n}=1,\,w_{n\,=1}=0,\,w_{n\,+2}=0\)
* \(w_{n-2}=1,\,w_{n-1}=2,\,w_{n}=3,\,w_{n\,=1}=2,\,w_{n\,+2}=3\)
* \(w_{n-2}=e^{\frac{-7}{2\pi^{2}}},\,w_{n-1}=e^{\frac{-1}{2\pi^{2}}},\,w_{n}=1,\, w_{n\,=1}=e^{\frac{-1}{2\pi^{2}}},\,w_{n\,+2}=e^{\frac{-7}{2\pi^{2}}}\)

where \(\sigma=1.67\) is the sigma in number of gaps (or equivalently of plates) obtained from a gaussian fit of the EM energy deposited in the accordion calorimeter for electrons shot at a given (\(\eta,\,\phi\)) point as explained in [3].
* We compute the correction function \(f_{corr}(\phi_{n})\) for each \(\phi_{n}\) with the following formula : \[f_{corr}(\phi_{n})=\frac{1}{(\frac{e^{(5)(n)}}{e_{0}}-1)\times\epsilon_{A}+1}\] For a random \(\phi,\) we determine \(n\) such as \(\phi_{n}<\phi<\phi_{n+1}\) and we make a linear interpolation of \(f_{corr}(\phi)\) between \(f_{corr}(\phi_{n})\) and \(f_{corr}(\phi_{n\,+1}).\)

Figures (3.b) and (3.c) present respectively \(\bar{e}^{(5)}\) and the correction function in the (C) case obtained from the lead plate thickness distribution used in the simulation. The corrected energy is then presented figure (4.b), showing a very good correction of the \(\phi\) inhomogeneities. The corrected energy is obtained with the following formula :

\[E_{rec}^{corrected}=\frac{E_{rec}}{f_{corr}}\]

Here, \(E_{rec}\) is already corrected from the usual \(\phi\) modulation as explained in the reference [4].

## 4 Application to the Module 0 lead plate distribution

In order to validate the method and to evaluate the effect on a realistic lead plate distribution, we have simulated a module with the effective plate thickness of the real Module 0. The plate distribution that we used is presented figure (5.a) as a function of the \(\phi\) angle.

We have triggered 4050 electrons in that simulation at a fixed \(\eta=0.3\) and in the \(\phi\) range \(\phi\in[0.1,0.3].\) We have then applied the same procedure as explained in [4] to extract a relevant evaluation of the sampling and constant Figure 5: (a) Plot of lead plate thickness put in the simulation versus \(\phi\) (\(\phi_{n}=\frac{2\pi}{1024}*n\) where \(n\) is the order indice in which they are put in the module and is in the range [1, 64]) in the calorimeter, (b) Plot of mean lead plate thickness over 5 plates (computed as explained in the text) versus \(n\), (c) correction function versus \(\phi\). This lead plate thickness distribution is the one of the Module 0 built up in Orsay last year.

term of the module 0 taking into account the residual usual \(\phi\) modulation and the lead plate thickness modulation.

Figure (6.a) shows the results obtained when only the usual \(\phi\) modulation correction is applied. We end with a constant term of \(2.9^{o}\!/_{bo}\pm 0.2^{o}\!/_{bo}\) and a sampling term of \(7.76\%\pm 0.08\%\).

Figures (6.b), (6.c) and (6.d) show the results obtained when a correction taking respectively into account :

* thickness of lead plate which is the closest to the generated direction of the electron (option A),
* thickness of the 5 plates with a triangle shower shape (option B)
* thickness of the 5 plates with a gaussian shower shape (option C).

One can see that as soon as one of these corrections is applied the constant term is highly reduced below \(3.^{o}\!/_{bo}\) and that the sampling term stays the same (\(7.76\%\pm 0.08\%\)) within the statistical errors of the perfect case.

Option C gives the best constant term as expected but the difference between option A,B and C is not large and stays in the error bar. Nevertheless, as all these plots correspond to the same initial distribution of events, the different plots are highly correlated. Thus we can infer that the improvement of the constant term from option A to C is real. This is confirmed also by the evolution of the \(\chi^{2}\) of the different fits which favors undoubtly option C.

The best result that we obtain is then a sampling term of \(7.76\%\pm 0.08\%\) and a constant term of \(2.8^{o}\!/_{bo}\pm 0.2^{o}\!/_{bo}\).

This result must be compared to the case of a perfect module with no lead fluctuation. This case has been studied in great details in the reference [4] where the constant term is found to be \(C_{perfect}=2.5^{o}\!/_{bo}\pm 0.17^{o}\!/_{bo}\) whereas the sampling term is \(A_{perfect}=7.89\%\pm 0.08\%\).

P1 is the sampling term and P2 the constant term.

## 5 Correction of a thickness step in the barrel calorimeter

The pairing program has been designed to perform a continuous pairing over the full half barrel. Nevertheless if an unfortunate event would destroy the homogeneity of the mean thickness, we would have a step function in the calorimeter of small amplitude due to the high quality lead used.

In order to test our capability to correct for such an effect, we have designed a toy distribution with a thickness step just in the middle of the simulated module (\(\phi=0.2\)). The thickness of the first 32 plates is \(1.520\;mm\) whereas the thickness of the last 32 plates is \(1.540\;mm\) as shown figure (7). This figure shows also the corresponding correction function computed as explained above.

Figure (8) shows the fit of \(\frac{\sigma_{Erec}}{E_{rec}}\) versus \(\phi_{gen}\) in two cases. The first (a) plot corresponds to the situation where no correction for lead thickness fluctuation is applied, the correspond constant term is found to be \(0.34\pm 0.02\%\). Corrected with the function corresponding to option C, the constant term is drastically reduced to \(0.26\pm 0.02\%\) almost at the level of the constant term of a perfect module i.e. without any lead thickness fluctuation (as shown in reference [4], \(C_{perfect}=0.25\pm 0.017\%\) ).

Conclusion

We have shown that the knowledge of the local thickness of each lead plate put in the calorimeter can be used to correct the reconstructed energy in the calorimeter from lead plate fluctuations. We have described the method used and we have presented an evaluation of the efficiency of this correction method using a simulation of a module with a realistic lead plate distribution taken from Module 0 construction data. We obtain a sampling term of \(7.767\%\pm 0.08\%\) and a constant term of \(2.8^{o}_{/\!\!\!/o}\pm 0.2^{o}_{/\!\!\!/o}\). This constant is to be compared to \(2.5^{o}_{/\!\!\!/o}\pm 0.17^{o}_{/\!\!\!/o}\) which was obtained from the simulation of a perfect module as reported in [4].

The total constant term is the sum of different terms coming from independant sources of inhomogeneities among which the more important are :

* the \(\phi\) asymetry coming from the non exact compensation of \(X_{0}\) depth around the bends in the accordion shape,
* the lead plates thickness fluctuations coming from the finite resolution of the laminating process (\(\sigma\sim 10\ \mu m\)),
* the intercalibration between modules,
* the electronic inhomogeneities of each channel

So the constant term can be written :

\[C_{tot}=C_{accortion}\oplus C_{lead}\oplus C_{electrodes}\oplus C_{electronics}\oplus C_{intercalibration}\oplus\ldots\]

In the present note, we investigate the relation between the first two terms. All the other terms were put to 0 in the simulation. From the "total" constant term of \(2.8^{o}_{/\!\!\!/o}\pm 0.2^{o}_{/\!\!\!/o}\) obtained, we can quote a value coming from the lead thickness fluctuation :

\[C_{lead}=1.2^{o}_{/\!\!\!/o}\]

Even the improbable contribution from a step of the lead thickness has been investigated and has been found to be easily corrected to a residual value which should not be seen in the data.
