## 1 Introduction

The muon momentum resolution in the ATLAS detector is limited by muon energy loss fluctuations in a calorimeter (fig.1). At the same time calorimeters.can provide a valuable information on the energy loss fluctuations on an event by event basis. The muon energy loss resolution in a \(LAr\) calorimeter is determined mainly by three factors: sampling fluctuations, pileup and electronic noise fluctuations. The increase of the ratio of absorber and readout layers means the increase of sampling fluctuations and the reduction of readout channels number that leads to the reduction of pileup and electronic noises and vice versa. This paper presents the results of the preliminary study of the muon energy loss resolution for different configurations of the hadron end-cap calorimeter.

## 2 Simulation Procedure

### Calorimeter

In order to simulate the muon response the hadron calorimeter geometry like shown in fig.2 was implemented in DICE. The two configuration chosen for the present study have the following settings:

Configuration 1 ("\(fine\)"):

* (2.5 \(cm\)\(Cu+0.8\)\(cm\)\(LAr\)) \(\times\) 56
* longitudinal structure: 4 segments (8/16/16/16)
* transverse segmentation: \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 2\pi/64\) above \(\eta=1.8\) \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.05\times 2\pi/64\) below \(\eta=1.8\)

Configuration 2 ("\(coarse\)"):* (2.5 \(cm\)\(Cu+0.8\)\(cm\)\(LAr)\times 24\) + (5.0 \(cm\)\(Cu+0.8\)\(cm\)\(LAr)\times 16\)
* longitudinal structure: 3 segments (8/16/16).
* transverse segmentation: as for the "\(fine\)" configuration.

The longitudinal segmentation (8/16/32) for the "\(fine\)" and (8/16/8/8) for the "\(coarse\)" configurations were considered as additional variants. For the full simulation of muon and minimum bias events the baseline option of electromagnetic part geometry was used.

### Electronic and pileup noise

#### 2.2.1 Hadronic part

The electronic noise (e-noise) was simulated assuming the \(mip/\sigma_{e-noise}\) ratio for one tower equals to two or three. For pileup noise the following dispersion can be derived [1]:

\[\sigma_{pileup}^{2}=\sigma_{E}^{2}\sum_{i=1}^{N}S^{2}(t_{0}\pm i\Delta) \tag{1}\]

where \(\sigma_{E}\) is \(RMS\) of energy deposited in a given calorimeter cell (tower). \(S\) is the signal waveform after the shaper (fig.3)[2], \(N\) is the number of bunch crossings before and after instant \(t_{0}\) that can contribute to the signal at \(t_{0}\), \(\Delta\) is the bunch crossing interval (25 \(ns\)). Therefore the estimate of the pileup noise included the following steps:

1. The full simulation of minimum bias events (1290 events were generated).
2. The division of minimum bias events in bunch crossings. (Each bunch crossing containes appropriate mean number of minimum bias events corresponding to the chosen luminosity).
3. The calculations of RMS of energy deposited in each calorimeter cell (data for same radiuses were averaged).
4. The application of the formula 1.

The pileup (solid histogram) and electronic noise (dashed histogram) distributions in towers at \(\eta=2.03\) for four longitudinal segments of the "\(fine\)" and for three segments of the "\(coarse\)" configurations are shown in fig.4 and fig.5 respectively. The dependences of pileup noise level in towers on \(\eta\) for four longitudinal segments of the "\(fine\)" and for three segments of the "\(coarse\)" configurations can be seen in fig.6 and fig.7 respectively. Fig.8 and fig.9 show the deposited energy distribution (solid) and the one smeared by combined noise (dashed) in towers of longitudinal segments of the "\(fine\)" and the "\(coarse\)" configurations where

\[\sigma_{combnoise}=\sigma_{e-noise}\bigoplus\sigma_{pileup}\]

#### 2.2.2 Electromagnetic part

The data from the table 2.5 (p.31) in TP [3] were used to simulate the electronic noise. The pileup noise was calculated according to formulae [4]:

\[\sigma(E_{t})(MeV)=79.+5995.(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi)^{0.8}\]

### Calibration

The muon energy loss in \(i^{th}\) event can be reconstructed in calorimeter as

\[E_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{M}C_{j}E_{ij}\]

where \(E_{ij}\) is the energy deposited in the \(j^{th}\) longitudinal segment of calorimeter, \(C_{j}\) are the calibration coefficients, \(M\) is the number of longitudinal parts. According to conventional method the calibration coefficients are determined by minimization of the functional:

\[F=\sum_{i=1}^{N}(E_{i}-Eloss_{i})^{2}\]

where \(Eloss_{i}\) is the muon energy loss in the \(i^{th}\) event, \(N\) is the number of events. For the reconstruction of muon energy loss we propose the new technique:

1. The range of energy deposited in a hadron end-cap calorimeter is divided to several intervals (in the our study -- 6).
2. For the each interval the functional is built \[F_{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{k}}(E_{i}-Eloss_{i})^{2}\] where \(N_{k}\) is the number of events with deposited energy (\(E_{d}\)) within \(k\)-interval.
3. The calibration coefficients \(C_{jk}\) correspond to minimum of the functional \(F_{k}\).
4. The muon energy losses for events with \(E_{d}\) within \(k\)-interval are reconstructed using \(C_{jk}\).

The idea of this calibration technique is based on the fact that \(e/mip\) ratio is about 0.9 for \((Cu/LAr)\) combination (fig.10) [5]. Lower energies deposited in the detector respect to \(mip\) whereas higher ones respect to electromagnetic showers. Thus, for different deposited energy intervals different calibration factors should be applied. Fig.11 shows the measured energy as a function of energy loss. One can see the increase of higher measured energies on the 6 intervals plot as compared to the plot obtained by 1 interval (conventional) method. The corresponding reduction of the contribution to muon momentum resolution of energy loss fluctuations (after measurements) can be seen in fig.12. It should be noted that the application of this calibration method for \(em\) part could induce the stronger effect due to large \(Z\) difference for \(Pb\) and \(Ar\) (for the present study we used reconstructed energies in \(em\) part provided by combined matrix).

### Correction methods

There are three methods to correct the muon momentum measured in the ATLAS muon system.

1. \(E_{\mu}=E_{\mu}+<E_{loss}>\) where \(<E_{loss}>\) - is the mean energy loss in a calorimeter. The error of this estimation is equal to \(E_{loss}-<E_{loss}>\)
2. \(E_{\mu}=E_{\mu}+<E_{meas}>\) where \(<E_{meas}>\) - is the energy loss measured in a calorimeter, \(Error=E_{loss}-E_{meas}\)
3. \(E_{\mu}=E_{\mu}+<E_{loss}>\) if \(E_{meas}<threshold\)\(E_{\mu}=E_{\mu}+<E_{meas}>\) if \(E_{meas}>threshold\)\(Error=(E_{loss}-<E_{loss}>|E_{loss}-E_{meas})\)

The last method can be applicable since the errors of energy loss measurement below some threshold turns out to be bigger than the energy loss spread. The fig.13 presents the example of \((E_{loss}-<E_{loss}>|E_{loss}-E_{meas})/E_{\mu}\) distribution obtained for \(\eta_{\mu}=2.03\) in the "\(coarse\)" configuration for the high luminosity. The contribution to the muon momentum resolution of energy loss fluctuations in a hadron end-cap calorimeter after application of the threshold method (third method) is

\[\sigma((E_{loss}-<E_{loss}>|E_{loss}-E_{meas}))/E_{\mu}.\]

Let us call this contribution \(CON_{hadr}\). The contribution of energy loss fluctuations in a full calorimeter will be called \(CON_{full}\) respectively. The \(CON_{hadr}\) as a function of the threshold level for the "coarse" configuration at low and high luminosities is shown in fig.14. The advantage of the threshold method as compared to the measurement of all energies (second method) can be seen in fig.15. The values of \(CON_{hadr}\) on these plots can be compared to about 4.5% that is energy loss fluctuations spread devided by \(E_{\mu}\) (first method error).

### Muon energy detection

The two algorithms of the detection of muon energy depositions in a hadron end-cap calorimeter are considered:

* The signals are detected in the towers that are crossed by muon track which direction can be provided by inner and outer tracker.
* Additionaly to the signals mentioned in the first item the signals in neighbouring towers are detected if the signals exceed \(3\sigma_{combnoise}\) (see 2.2.1).

Fig.16 demonstrates some insignificant advantage of the second algorithm to the first one. So the second one was chosen for signals clusterization.

Results

Figs.17 and 18 present the 37 \(GeV\) and 187 \(GeV\) muon energy loss resolutions versus the luminosity for the "\(fine\)" and the "\(coarse\)" configurations and for the different assumptions for electronic noise level. The energy loss resolutions below and above a threshold are called

\(\sigma(E_{loss}-<E_{loss}>)/E_{loss}\) and \(\sigma(E_{loss}-E_{meas})/E_{loss}\) respectively.

Figs.(\(19\div 22\)) summarize the dependences of \(CON_{hadr}\) (see 2.4) and \(CON_{full}\) on the luminosity for \(E_{\mu}=37.4\ GeV\). The "\(Fine\)" and the "\(coarse\)" configurations are compared on the plots. The calculations were carried out for the rapidities 1.75, 2.03, 2.06, 2.43. The \(\eta=2.06\) corresponds to the muon path through two towers per a longitudinal segment. As to the \(\eta=1.75\) energy losses and depositions only in \(LAr\) calorimeters were taken into account. The two figures per each \(\eta\) point correspond to two assumptions for an electronic noise level. The same study was performed for \(E_{\mu}=187\ GeV\) (figs.\(23\div 26\)). For the \(E_{\mu}=37.4\ GeV\) at the \(\eta=2.03\) and for the high luminosity contribution to muon momentum resolution of muon energy loss fluctuations after the application of theshold method is manly determined by pileup noise, whereas for the muon energy of 187 \(GeV\) and for the high luminosity the influences of the calorimeter configuration and pileup noise are approximatly equivalent at the \(\eta=2.03\). The dependences of \(CON_{hadr}\) on the luminosity for the other possible longitudinal structures for the "\(fine\)" (8/16/32) and for the "\(coarse\)" (8/16/8/8) configurations are shown in fig.27. Some effect on resolutions from the improvement of longitudinal segmentation can be seen when \(E_{\mu}=37.4\ GeV\).

## 4 Conclusion

The preliminary study of the measurement of muon energy loss in \(LAr\) end-cap calorimeter was performed for the different hadron calorimeter configurations, \(E_{\mu}=37.4\), 187 \(GeV\), over \((1.75\div 2.43)\ \eta\) range, \((0.1\div 1.0)\cdot 10^{34}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) luminosity range. The various procedures of calorimeter calibration, muon energy loss detection and correction were considered. The calculations of pileup noise for hadron calorimeter were carried out. Both the pileup and electronic noise were taken into account. The contribution to muon momentum resolution of muon energy loss fluctuations can be reduced by muon energy loss measurements. This effect depends on muon energy, calorimeter configuration, luminosity and electronic noise level. For higher muon energies the calorimeter configuration plays more significant role than for lower ones. This study is preliminary since

1. The electronic noise level should be determined as a function of tower radius.
2. The muon statistics should be increased.
3. The several intervals calibration method should be applied for the \(em\) part (a significant effect is expected).
4. The pileup noise should be calculated separately for three sections of the \(em\) calorimeter (front, middle and back).

5. The energy loss measurement in tiles should be taken into account for \(\eta_{\mu}<1.85\).
