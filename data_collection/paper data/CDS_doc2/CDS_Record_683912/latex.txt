## 1 Introduction-The Quality Assurance Plan

The performance goals of the ATLAS muon spectrometer require unprecedented mechanical precision in the construction of the large number of Monitored Drift Tube chambers (1194) built at many production sites (11) over a period of more than 4 years. At the same time, the reliability the large number of drift tubes (371000) and chambers must be very high.

Measurement of the wire locations in assembled chambers and verification of their accuracy with the X-ray tomograph can only be performed for a fraction of the chambers, approximately 15 %.

The strategy for the distributed, large-scale production of the precision chambers is to guarantee the mechanical precision of drift tubes and assembled chambers by the design of the components and of the assembly method and tooling supplemented by an extensive monitoring program and detailed quality assurance plan for all production sites.

In addition, in a common quality control program of the important parameters for the reliability and performance of individual drift tubes and of assembled chambers are tested. The quality control tests are designed such that they safely detect bad drift tubes and chambers while they can be performed at all production sites and keep up with the production rate. Only small failure rates are acceptable in the production process. The main purpose of the tests is to provide quick feed back for adjustment of the assembly tooling in the case of problems.

Faulty chamber components and drift tubes will be rejected. The failure rate of assembled drift tubes must not exceed the few percent level. Chambers failing the quality control tests have to be repaired (identification of leaks, sputtering of noisy tubes); faulty tubes in a chamber which cannot be recovered will be disconnected. Chambers exceeding the mechanical accuracy requirements can be recovered by measureing the wire locations with the X-ray tomograph. Only in exceptional cases chambers will have tobe rejected.

The quality assurance procedures for MDT chamber construction can be broken down into the following steps:

1. Chamber Components and Materials,
2. Drift Tube Assembly,
3. Drift Tube Test,
4. Chamber Assembly,
5. Chamber Test,
6. Transport and Storage.

The quality assurance procedures for each step are decribed in this document. Quality control of the electronics and data aquisition to be mounted on the chambers during installation in the ATLAS detector will be described in separate documents.

Detailed archiving of the monitoring and test data is necessary in order to monitor and control the production process and to provide complete documentation for the operation of the chambers. The data will be stored in local quality assurance data bases at the production sites and as well as in a central production data base.

The central data base contains the information needed to monitor the production and evaluate the quality of the chambers to be installed and which will be kept for the operation of the muon spectrometer.

In the local data bases all available data from assembly monitoring and quality control should be kept until the completion of all chambers to allow the detection and tracing of problems during chamber production.

In addition, the information about delivery and stock of components and the completion, transport and storage times of drift tubes and chambers is kept in the local and central production data bases at different levels.

The production sites are requested to report all problems occuring during tube and chamber assembly. Production should not continue before the problems are not understood and solved in consultation with the other production sites.

An internal review of each production site will take place before module 0 construction at the site in order to ensure that all procedures and tools follow the specifications.

Before the start of series production, each production site will be qualified based on the data from module 0 construction and test.

This document gives the guidelines and serves as reference for the implementation of the quality assurance procedures and quality control tests at the MDT chamber production sites.

## 3 Chamber Components

The main chamber components and materials to be controlled are:

1. Precision aluminum tubes.
2. Gold-plated W-Rh wire.
3. Precision endplugs and endplug components.
4. Spacer components.
5. Components of the optical alignment system.
6. On-chamber gas distribution system.
7. Faraday cages and patch panels.
8. Glue (several types).
9. Hedgehog boards.
10. Mezzanine cards with readout electronics.
11. Temperature and magnetic field sensors.
12. Protective covers.

Quality and tolerances of the chamber components delivered to the chamber production sites are controlled in four steps:

1. Quality assurance by the supplier
2. Central monitoring of material production including sample tests at an responsible institute.
3. Acceptance tests and visual inspection at the chamber production sites.
4. Specification for packing, transport, storage and handling of the components.

### Aluminum Tubes

The thin-wall aluminum tubes for the drift tubes of the MDT chambers follow tight mechanical tolerances with respect to the outer and inner diameter and the straightness in order to be suitable for the precision assembly of the chambers.

The tubes are cleaned on the inside and outside by the manufacturer according to a cleaning procedure defined in detail which has been approved by the collaboration after ageing tests. The cleaning procedure must not be changed without the agreement of the collaboration and after new ageing test have been performed with the new cleaning procedure.

The mechanical tolerances and the cleanliness of the tubes must be conserved during all further transport, storage and handling of the bare tubes and of the assembled drift tubes (see: Drift Tube Assembly and Storage).

The precision aluminum tubes are procured centrally via CERN.

#### Quality Control by Supplier

The following quality control tests of the bare tubes are required from the supplier with certification:

1. Chemical and mechanical analysis and ultrasonic test of the tube raw materials.
2. Geometrical tolerances of extruded tubes.
3. Geometrical tolerances of drawn and straightened tubes.
4. Geometrical tolerances, including straightness, of at least 10% of finished tubes of each batch.
5. Visual inspection of inside and outside of at least 10% of finished tubes of each batch, including proper deburring of tube ends.

Each finished tube is identified by a barcode (industrial format 39B) which contains the production run number, a sequential tube identification number, tube length and a date and appears also in alphanumeric form. The barcode is written in locations along the tube which will not be attached to the spacer in case additional cleaning is required for glueing.

Quality control documents and data with reference to the tube bar code are provided to the collaboration and are kept in the **Production Data Base** for monitoring of the production.

Detection of small holes on the tube walls by the supplier, e.g. with the eddy current method, is too expensive. Therefore, the walls of all drift tubes have to be tested for gas tightness at the chamber production sites.

#### Production Monitoring

Production monitoring is done centrally at CERN including the following sample tests per batch of tubes delivered to the chamber production sites:

1. Visual inspection, inside and outside (obvious defects or holes, cleaning, deburring, straightness).
2. Geometrical tolerances with 3D metrology.
3. Chemical and mechanical analysis of the finished tube material.
4. Metallurgical analysis of the finished tubes.
5. Chemical analysis of inner tubes surface (monitoring of cleaning procedure).
6. Quality control of cleaning procedure over time with the ageing test stand.

In case of failed tests, the supplier is notified and the affected batches are returned.

During tube assembly at the production sites, each tube is visually inspected at the inside and outside for obvious defects, proper deburring and cleanliness.

#### Tube Transport and Storage

The aluminum tubes are cleaned on the inside and outside by the manufacturer. Afterwards, the tubes are kept under clean conditions and are not cleaned anymore at the chamber production sites, especially not on the inside.

The tubes are transported and stored under the following conditions:1. The tubes are always transported in stable wooden boxes like the ones used for delivery by the manufacturer.
2. The individual tubes are kept separated from each other and held such that they cannot move inside the transport box.
3. The tubeends are closed and protected with soft plastic caps.
4. Inside the transport box and in storage, the tubes are enclosed in air-tight plastic bags containing dehumidifier bags. During longer storage periods, the enclosing plastic bags should be filled with inert gas to prevent corrosion.

#### Quality Control at Production Sites

Quality control tests of the bare tubes at the chamber production sites are summarized in Table 1.

### 3.2 Wire

The gold-plated tungsten-rhenium sense wire for the drift tubes is procured centrally via CERN.

#### Quality Control by Supplier

The following quality control tests of the wire are required from the supplier with certification:

1. Measurement of tensile strength at beginning and end of each spool.
2. Test of percentage of gold plating at beginning and end of each spool.
3. Visual and microscopic inspection of gold plating quality for at least first meters of each spool.

Each wire spool is certified and labelled with date, wire length and production run number.

#### Production Monitoring

Production monitoring is done centrally at CERN including the following sample tests per production run:

1. Measurement of wire diameter.
2. Microscopic inspection of gold plating quality.
3. Inspection of cleanliness.
4. Measurement of tensile strength.
5. Measurement of electrical conductivity.

In case of failed tests, the supplier is notified and the affected batches are returned.

#### Quality Control at Production Sites

Quality control at the chamber production sites is summarized in Table 1.

### 3.3 Endplugs

The endplugs for the drift tubes consist of the following components:

1. Injection moulded insulator made of Noryl GFN3 which contains 30% glass fiber and is machined to be concentric and coaxial with the aluminum ring references surface.
2. Precisely machined metal inserts in the plastic body: 1. Aluminum grounding with precise reference surface for drift tube tube positioning on assembly combs and precise front face for accurate endplug insertion. 2. Central brass insert holding the wire locator in a precisely concentric and coaxial hole with respect to the reference surface.
3. Precise wire locator, machined separately and held in the concentric hole of the brass insert with an injection moulded Noryl clip.
4. Copper wire crimp tube inserted in central brass piece.
5. Brass sealing cap with signal pin to be screwed onto the brass insert.
6. Injection moulded Noryl gas connector sealed with two O-rings between the front face of the plastic body and the signal cap.
7. Brass ground pin in contact with the aluminuming through athreaded hole and a nut with lock washer.
8. O-ring for gas seal of the plastic endplug body in the aluminumtube.

The endplugs and their components are not individually labelled for cost reasons. Endplugs of different production batches are kept in separate boxes at each production site and are not mixed during tube assembly to help tracing of problems.

The endplug components are procured centrally via CERN. At least parts of the endplugs have to be assembled at the chamber production sites.

#### Quality Control by Supplier

The following quality control tests of the endplugs and their components are required from the supplies with certification for a fraction of at least 2% of the endplugs:

1. Visual inspection of the injection moulded piece: smooth surfaces without air bubbles or cracks, especially in the O-ring grooves.
2. Inspection of the bulk of the injection moulded piece by cutting longitudinally through the center: no enclosed bubbles larger than 0.2 mm in diameter, no cracks.
3. Metal inserts must not detach under specified force.
4. Visual inspection of machined endplug components: Proper cleaning and deburing, smooth surfaces, no sharp edges, no metal chips, no scratches, no air bubbles or cracks in plastic piece.
5. Test of fitting of components.
6. Verification of all mechanical tolerances of endplug and wire locator with 3D metrology.

#### Production Monitoring

The production is monitored by responsible institutes which centrally perform the following sample tests per production batch:

1. Visual inspection of all parts: Proper cleaning and deburring; smooth surfaces, no sharp edges, no metal chips, no scratches, no air bubbles or cracks in the plastic parts.
2. Test of fitting of all components.
3. Verification of all mechanical tolerances of endplug and wire locator with 3D metrology.
4. Inspection of the bulk of the injection moulded piece by cutting the endplug longitudinally through the center: no enclosed air bubbles, no cracks.
5. High voltage test of a fraction of endplugs per production batch assembled in drift tubes filled with dry nitrogen: leakage currents below 2 nA up to a voltage of 5 kV.
6. Measurement of the shape and diameter of the wire locating hole and of the concentricity with respect to the endplug reference surface with a CCD camera.

In case of failed tests, the supplier is notified and the affected batches are returned.

#### Quality Control at the Production Sites

Quality control tests at the chamber production sites are summarized in Table 1.

During assembly of the endplugs at the production sites and during preparation for tube assembly, all endplug components, including wire locator and crimp tube, are visually inspected for obvious defects (no sharp edges, proper deburring, no metal chips, no scratches, no air bubbles or cracks in the plastic parts).

All O-rings are inspected for obvious defects during assembly on the endplug. The O-rings must not be exposed to light during storage or assembled on the endplugs to prevent ageing.

The endplug components are cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaning bath using only pure ethanol. Other cleaning fluids are not allowed.

### 3.4 Spacer Components

The extruded aluminum spacer profiles are procured centrally via a responsible institute which monitors the production. Machining of the profiles to reach the final mechanical tolerances is the responsibility of each production site.

The mechanical tolerances of the extruded and cut profiles are verified by the supplier and the responsible institute for each batch delivered.

The mechanical tolerances of the machined spacer components are verified for each chamber at the chamber production sites. The glue gaps between cross plates and tubes layers are verified during spacer assembly (see the **Chamber Assembly Manual**). The functioning of the sag compensation system is tested after assembly on the spacer.

### Optical Alignment System Components

The components of the ATLAS optical alignment monitoring systems installed on the chambers during asse mply are:1. Components of RASNIK monitors (LED with mask, custom-fabricated lens and CCD with infrared filter with housings) for the in-plane alignment system.
2. Mounting platforms for components of the projective alignment monitors.
3. Mounting platforms for the axial/praxial alignment monitors.

The components are procured centrally from industry by responsible institutes which monitor the production and performs sample tests of the optical quality of the lenses (focal length within \(\pm 3\) mm of the nominal value and mismatch between optical and geometrical center \(<1\) mm) and of the electrical functionality of light sources and CCDs.

The focal length of the RASNIK lens is specific for each monitor and engraved on the lens holder. It is specified to be within \(\pm 3\) mm of the nominal value (\(1/4\) of the distance between mask and CCD). This tolerance corresponds to a maximum forseen longitudinal range of adjustment of \(\pm 12\) mm of the light source with mask with respect to the lens. This can be verified on a special RASNIK test stand at the chamber production sites prior to the assembly of the spacer. Otherwise the lens is rejected.

As part of the chamber assembly procedure, each in-plane alignment monitor is adjusted and fully tested on the spacer (sharp and analysable image of the center of the mask with sufficient brightness) before permanent fixation with glue (see the Assembly Control Plan in the Appendix).

The RASNIK components on the spacer must not move after the first zero-reading; otherwise the in-plane alignment system has to be zeroed again on a granite table. In order to detect and trace potential errors of the in-plane alignment system, it is recommended to cover the fixation points of the in-plane alignment components on the spacer with special paint used in aircraft industry which indicates by colour change if a component has moved.

Correct relative orientation of the RASNIK mask and CCD is important for the analysis software and ensured with labelling by the supplier.

The use of the RASNIK systems is described in RASNIK Manuals by the responsible institutes.

### 3.6 On-Chamber Gas Distribution System

The components of the on-chamberg gas system are centrally procured by a responsible institute which monitors the production and the quality control by the suppliers.

The gas manifolds are preassembled at the chamber production sites and tested for gas tightness and flow rate per tube (see Table 3). After mounting on the chamber, the gas system is leak tested together with the whole chamber (see Tables 4 and 5).

Assembly and test of the on-chamber gas system is described in the On-Chamber Gas System Manual by the responsible institute.

### 3.7 Faraday Cages and Patch Panels

The fabrication and quality control of the Faraday cages and patch panels for readout electronics and optical, temperature and B-field monitors are the responsibility of each institute.

### 3.8 Glue

All glue types used for chamber assembly are epoxy resin based two-component glues. They have been selected because they provide sufficient strength in contact with aluminum and handling and curing time are suitable for chamber series production. In dedicated tests and during chamber prototype construction, the shrinkage of the selected glues was found to be small enough to prevent significant chamber deformations. Epoxy resin based glues are known to be radiation tolerant far beyond the radiation levels in the ATLAS muon spectrometer.

Only glue from one supplier, Ciba Geigy, will be used at all production sites. The selected glue types are all widely used standard products of the supplier with well known properties and reliability and have been exclusively used for the construction of all prototype MDT chambers.

The quality of the glue is guaranteed by the supplier. Glue storage and handling follow strictly the recommendations by the glues supplier. Storage time and conditions of the glue is monitored at the chamber production sites.

Details of the glue types and the glueing procedures are given in the chapter **Chamber Assembly**.

### 3.9 Hedgehog Boards

The hedgehog boards are delivered to the chamber production sites fully tested and certified. They are either delivered clean in sealed packages or they have to be cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaning bath at the chamber production site before installation. After unpacking or cleaning, the boards are handled only with gloves.

All boards are visually inspected for obvious defects upon delivery. Correct positioning of the electrical contact holes is verified on a template in order to avoid forces on the endplugs when the boards are installed.

Installation of the boards and high voltage test on the chamber takes place in the chamber test stands at the production sites. The boards stay on the chamber.

### 3.10 Mezzanine Cards

The mezzanine cards with the readout electronics are delivered to the chamber production sites fully tested and certified. The boards are visually inspected for obvious defects upon delivery. Mounting of the cards on the chamber and high voltage and functionality test will take place either in the local chamber test stand or in the central storage area at CERN as soon as the cards have been delivered.

### 3.11 Temperature and B-Field Sensors

The temperature and B-field sensors, including cables, are procured and fabricated centrally by responsible institutes and are sample tested by them. The function of each sensor is tested at the chamber production site before the installation on the chamber.

### 3.12 Protective Covers

The material for the protective covers for installation in the detector will be procured centrally. Cutting to size and installation on the chambers is done at the chamber production sites.

## 4 Drift Tube Fabrication

### Drift Tube Assembly

Operation of the large number of drift tubes in the ATLAS muon spectrometer requires very high reliability with respect to wire tension, gas tightness and high voltage stability. At the same time, the sense wires have to be centered in the precision aluminum tubes with high accuracy: with \(\pm 10\)\(\mu\) m rms relative to the endplug reference surfaces in the \(y\) and \(z\) coordinates of the azimuthally oriented tubes and with a tolerance of \(\pm 100\)\(\mu\)m with respect to the innertube wall envelope. The wire tension has to stay inside tight tolerances in order to predict the wire sag with high accuracy.

During series production, typically 50-100 drift tubes per day have to be assembled and tested at each production site. Because of the large number of tubes, rejection of only few percent of the assembled drift tubes can be afforded after the quality control tests.

The drift tube assembly procedures are designed to guarantee the high precision and reliability of the drift tubes:

1. The drift tubes are assembled in a temperature controlled clean room of class 50000.
2. The room temperature is controlled to be \(20\pm 1^{\circ}\)C. This allows to set the tube length and the wire tension of the assembled tubes with sufficient accuracy.
3. Automatic or semi-automatic wiring stations are used. Manual handling of the wire is minimized.
4. Colinearity of the endplug and tube axes, the relative azimuthal orientation of the two endplugs of a drift tube and the drift tube length (defined as the distance between the aluminum front faces of the endplugs) at a given temperature are mechanically determined by the assembly tooling.
5. Critical parameters of the drift tube assembly process are controlled by computer.
6. The wire is over-tensioned for a defined time interval in order to minimize wire creeping.

The **Drift Tube Assembly Manual** contains detailed instructions for handling and assembly of the drift tubes. The main drift tube assembly steps are implemented in a **Drift Tube Assembly Control Program**.

In particular, the following procedures are applied to maintain the quality of the drift tubes:

1. The tubes are stored in the temperature controlled wiring room before assembly to adapt to the temperature.
2. Each individual tube is identified by its barcode which is read into the data base directly with a barcode scanner just before wiring.
3. The tube wiring room is cleaned regularly.

4. During work in the tube wiring room, hair and shoe protection, coats and gloves certified for clean rooms are used. Before entering the clean room, clothes are changed in a separate chamber.
5. Before assembly, the endplugs are cleaned in an ultrasonic cleaning bath. Only pure ethanol is allowed for cleaning of Noryl plugs.
6. The bare tubes, the endplugs, the wire and the assembled tubes are visually inspected before, during and after the wiring procedure (see Tables 1-3). They are only handled with gloves certified for clean rooms.
7. The sense wire is inserted into the tubes directly from the pool without additional cleaning and risk of contamination.
8. It is recommended to orient the tubes such during tube wiring that the bar codes are accessible when the tubes are inserted into the chamber assembly jig.

### 4.2 Drift Tube Ground Contact

A reliable ground contact between aluminum tube and the aluminum ground ring of the endplug which is long-term stable is ensured by lasers spot welding at the tube ends with at least three spots per endplug. Detailed instructions for the laser welding process are given in the **Laser Welding Manual for Drift Tube Ground Contact**.

The quality of the laser welds is verified by the following procedures:

1. Visual inspection for each tube during (all welds) and after (random sample of tubes) laser welding: welds at correct place, no deformations on the endplug reference surface, visible quality in agreement with reference welds. In case of problems, the laser and setup are adjusted and the welding is redone.
2. Inspection of randomly selected welded drift tubes under a microscope: no obvious cracks in the welding spots. In case of problems, the laser and setup are adjusted and the welding on the affected tubes is redone.
3. At the start of production, a sample of welds from each production site is evaluated metallurgical by cutting and inspection under the microscope.

### 4.3 Drift Tube Transport and Storage

The assembled drift tubes are transported and stored under the following conditions:

1. The tubes are always transported in stable wooden boxes like the ones used for delivery of bare tubes by the manufacturer.
2. The individual tubes are kept separated from each other and held such that they cannot move inside the transport box.
3. The tubends and endplugs are covered and protected with soft plastic caps like the ones used for the transport of bare tubes.
4. Inside the transport box and in storage, the tubes are enclosed in air-tight plastic bags containing dehumidifier bags.

5. After assembly and test, the drift tubes are always kept gas sealed until the gas distribution system is installed on the chamber. It is recommended to store and transport the drift tubes filled with inert gas in order to prevent corrosion.
6. During transport, only temperature variations in the range 0 - 50\({}^{\circ}\)C are allowed. (This means that the wire tension can increase temporarily by up to 45 g (1.5 g/\({}^{\circ}\)C) above the nominal tension of 350 g at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C, i.e. by 13%.)
7. During storage, the temperature has to stay within the range 10 - 30\({}^{\circ}\)C.

## 5 Drift Tube Test

Successful operation of the large number of drift tubes in the ATLAS experiment requires, in addition to the high mechanical accuracy in the wire location, very high reliability of the tubes with respect to high voltage stability, gas tightness and minimized risk of ageing.

Quality control tests of the drift tubes are a major part of the chamber construction. They must ensure the reliability of the drift tubes over their long lifetime. At the same time the tests are designed such that they can be performed routinely and in reproducible manner and fast enough to keep up with the speed of the tube production at a rate of 50-100 tubes per day at each production site. Automated tubes test stands operated under computer control are in preparation (see Figure 2).

The following quality control tests are performed for each assembled drift tube at the tube production sites:

1. Visual inspection.
2. Wire tension (oscillation frequency) measurement.
3. Wire location measurement.
4. Gas pressure and leak test of the whole drift tube.
5. HV stability test: 1. Leakage current measurement. 2. Cosmic count rate measurement (optional).

The mechanical tolerances are tested for a random sample of drift tubes per day.

The ground contact resistance between tube and the aluminum ground ring of the endplug is measured for a random sample of drift tubes after production and monitored overtime for selected drift tubes before assembly and in an assembled chamber.

If drift tube and chamber production sites do not coincide, instructions for packing and transport of the assembled drift tubes have to be observed.

The following tests are recommended to be performed at the accepting site for a random sample of the delivered drift tubes:

1. Visual inspection (defects on endplugs or tubes).

2. Leak test of endplugs.
3. Ground contact resistance (as Table 3).

The wire tension (oscillation frequency) is measured at the chamber production sites for each drift tube before assembly in the chamber.

During all tests, individual drift tubes are identified by their bar code with a bar code scanner.

The drift tube quality control tests performed at all production sites are summarized in Tables 2 and 3. The test procedures are explained in the following. Table 4 gives an overview of the drift tube quality control equipment planned to be used at the production sites.

### 5.1 Wire Tension Measurement

The gravitational sag of the wires has to be controlled within a tolerance of \(\pm 10\)\(\mu\)m in order to predict the wire position between the tubeeds with sufficient accuracy. The wire sag \(s\) between the wire locators is related to the wire tension \(T\) by \(s=g\,\pi\rho d^{2}L^{2}/(32\ T)\) where \(g\) is the gravitational acceleration.

Measurement of the ground mode wire oscillation frequency \(\nu\) allows to determine the tension \(T\) of the wire with density \(\rho\), diameter \(d\) and length \(L\) according to the relation \(T=\pi\rho d^{2}L^{2}\nu^{2}\) and, using the above relations, directly the wire sag \(s=g/(32\ \nu^{2})\) independent of geometrical and material parameters of the wire.

The wire tension is required to stay within a tolerance of \(\pm 5\%\) of the nominal value of \(350\) g at the nominal temperature of \(20\pm 1^{\circ}\)C (the wire ground mode frequency therefore has to stay within \(\pm 2.5\%\) of the nominal value). During wire tensioning and tension measurement, the tube temperature has to be controlled and measured with this accuracy. The wire tension is measured immediately after drift tube assembly to give feed-back to the tube assembly and tested again after at least two weeks before installation in the chamber in order to minimize the risk of wire creep or slippage.

The measurements of the wire oscillation frequency and of the corresponding temperature are stored in the central data base for the accepted tubes installed in the chamber. All measurements including history are kept in the local data bases for reference and tracing of problems.

The instruments used for wire oscillation frequency measurement at the production sites are summarized in Table 4. An example with a commercial tension meter is shown in Figure 1.

### 5.2 Wire Location Measurement

Measurements of the wire locations at the tubeeds in the two transverse coordinates are performed with two methods (see Table 4).

1. X-ray measurement: For the wire position measurement, the tubeeds are held in a jig in the same way and in the same azimutal orientation as later in the chamber assembly jig. Reference wires with known distances are embedded in the V-block holding the endplug. With two X-ray sources illuminating the tube under a stereo angle close to the endplug, shadows of the sense and the reference wires are projected onto two X-ray CCDs (see Figures 3 and 4). Using the reference wire grid, the \(y\) and \(z\) positions of the sense wire can be reconstructed with respect to the endplug reference surface (on which it is supported on the jig) with a resolution of \(2\ \mu\)m. The measurement determines the wire position as in the chamberindependent of the roundness of the endplug reference surface. A second measurement after rotating the tube around its axis by \(180^{\circ}\) determines the wire location for both orientations of drift tubes in the chambers and tests if the wire is held correctly by the wire locator. The layout of a wire location measurement station for series production is shown in Figure 6. The straightness of bare and assembled drift tubes including coaxiality of the endplugs with respect to the tube (see Tables 1 and 2) can be tested on the same jig (tubes interferences and wire displacements).
2. Electromagnetic pickup measurement: Signals of an alternating current circulating through the sense wire is picked up by two coils on opposite sides of the tube (see Figure 5). The difference in the signal amplitudes allows to determine the wire displacement from the center in the plane of the coils with a resolution of 2 \(\mu\)m. By rotating the tube on the support points on the endplug reference surface, the wire displacement from the center of the reference surface in both transverse coordinates can be determined.

The measurement setups are regularly aligned and recalibrated with a calibration tube. Tubes are accepted if the measured wire locations at both ends are within \(\pm 25\)\(\mu\)m of the centers of the endplug reference surfaces in the \(y\) and the \(z\) coordinates (defined by the endplug orientation). The tolerance corresponds to 2.5 times the required rms of 10 \(\mu\)m of the wire location in individual drift tubes. The wire location measurements should be performed for azimuthally oriented tubes, for example by means of the tube clocking piece installed on one endplug which is used during chamber assembly and which seals the tube after tube quality control until installation of the gas system on the chamber. In this way, the wire locations can be determined in a common coordinate system, for instance the ATLAS coordinate system. This helps for the tracing of problems and allows to make contact with the X-ray tomograph measurements and to improve their reliability. It is thefore particularly important for chambers with mechanical problems which need to be recovered by X-ray to mograph measurement. For the module 0 chambers, the wire locations in all tubes will be measured. During series production, the measurement of only a fraction of the tubes produced per day is required to test the quality of the precision endplugs and the tube assembly tooling. The results for accepted tubes installed in the chambers are stored in the central data base; all measurements including history are kept in the local data bases for reference and tracing of problems.

### 5.3 Gas Pressure and Leak Test

Each complete drift tube (including endplugs and tube wall) has to pass a gas pressure test at 1.5 times the nominal overpressure of 2 bar for safety reasons. Afterwards the tubes are visually inspected and tested for gas leaks. A tight limit of \(1\cdot 10^{-8}\) bar l/s is required for the gas leak rate of each individual drift tube in the MDT chambers at the nominal operating pressure of 3 bar in order to prevent back diffusion and gas contamination. The direct detection of holes in the tube walls by the manufacturer, e.g. with the eddy current method, proved to be too expensive. Therefore the whole drift tube including endplugs and tube walls has to be leak tested. For this purpose, the drift tubes are fully enclosed in a container. The drift tubes in the container are filled with an Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) gas mixture with helium admixture up to 3 bar overpressure to perform the required pressure test. Subsequently, the argon or helium leak rate into the evacuated container is measured at the nominal overpressure of 2 bar with a mass spectrometer of helium leak detector (see Figures 7 and 8). For the many different tube lengths in the endcap chambers an alternative method is also used. The leakage of the whole tube is measured in evacuated fixtures at the tubends (endplugs) and with a fixture moved along the tube using a helium leak detector (see Figure 9).

A drift tube is accepted if its individual leak rate at 2 bar overpressure is demonstrated to be below \(1\cdot 10^{-8}\) bar \(\mathrm{l/s}\). The test results for accepted tubes installed in the chambers are stored in the central data base; all measurements including history are kept in the local data bases for reference and tracing of problems.

The gas leak test is the most time consuming part of the drift tube quality control. Automated leak test stands are prepared which measure the daily tube production over night under computer control (see Figure 2 and Table 4). A large number of tubes is either tested simultaneously in multi-tube containers or sequentially in many single-tube containers (see Figure 8). In the automated test stands, the leak test is integrated with automatic wire tension measurement and leakage current measurement for the high voltage stability test.

### 5.4 High Voltage Stability Test

The high voltage stability of the drift tubes is tested with Ar:CO2 (93:7) at 3 bar because this is the baseline gas mixture and particularly sensitive to imperfections of inner tube wall and wire.

Tests have shown that the leakage currents of good drift tubes with this gas mixture at 3 bar are typically 70 pA/m at the nominal operating point at 3080 V (\(2\cdot 10^{4}\) gas gain) and 120 pA/m and 520 pA/m at 3190 V (\(4\cdot 10^{4}\) gas gain) and 3400 V (\(16\cdot 10^{4}\) gas gain), respectively. These currents are close to the expectation from the cosmic count rate.

A common high voltage stability test is defined as measurement of the drift tube leakage current at 3400 V with a sensitivity of 1 nA which the existing commercial HV systems provide. The high voltage is ramped up slowly, typically in steps of 100 V. The tubcurrent at each step is limited to be less than 2 nA/m (measured after settling time). The duration of the high voltage test at 3400 V is limited to 10 minutes.

Drift tubes are accepted if the tube leakage current at 3400 V is below 2 nA per metertube length. The test results for accepted drift tubes installed in the chambers are stored in the central data base; all measurements including history are kept in the local data bases for reference and tracing of problems. Optionally, the following additional high voltage tests will be performed at a number of production sites for all or a fraction of the drift tubes (see Table 4):

1. Monitoring of the leakage current over night at the nominal operating point at 3080 V.
2. Measurement of the leakage current with increased sensitivity with pA-meters.
3. Measurement of the cosmic count rate at 3190 V (\(2\times\) the nominal gas gain).
4. Monitoring of the cosmic count rate over night at the nominal operating point at 3080 V.
5. Measurement of the signal rate and shape with a radioactive source.

The test results are recorded in the local data bases.

To improve the compatibility of the cosmic count rate measurements at different sites, readout electronics using the BNL preamplifier and shaper is prepared at BNL for a common test.

In the automated drift tubes test stands, wire tension, leak rate and leakage current measurements are integrated (see Figure 8).

## 6 Chamber Assembly

### Assembly Setup

#### 6.1.1 Assembly Room

The MDT chambers are assembled in a climatized room in clean environment. The following requirements are important to control the mechanical precision and stability of the chamber construction:

1. The temperature in the assembly room is controlled such that it is stable and uniform within \(20\pm 0.5^{\circ}\)C above the surface of the assembly table and within \(20\pm 1^{\circ}\)C in the rest of the assembly room.
2. Temperature differences between the outer cross plates and the end combs (measured with the temperature probes on the spacer and temperature sensors on the combs) should be below \(0.5^{\circ}\)C during the glueing process in order to avoid unwanted wire offsets between adjacent layers.
3. The relative humidity in the assembly room is controlled to be \(50\pm 10\%\) to ensure proper curing of the glue.
4. The assembly room is cleaned regularly.
5. During work in the assembly room, hair and shoe protection, coats and gloves certified for clean rooms are used. Before entering the clean room, clothes are changed in a separate chamber.

Emergency power is needed in order to restore the climatization quickly after a power failure during glue curing. The vacuum underpressure must not fall below the tolerance before power is restored.

#### 6.1.2 Granite Table

A granite table surface with absolute flatness of at least 20 \(\mu\)m serves as reference for the setup of the assembly jigging. To guarantee the flatness of the granite table and therefore the alignment of the assembly jigging over the whole time period of chamber production, it is recommended to follow the following procedures:

1. The table is kinematically supported on 3 feet as specified by the manufacturer and on a stable concrete floor.
2. The planarity of the table has to be measured after setting it up in the climatized room and before installation of the assembly jigging. The measurement is best done by professionals using tilt meters. If necessary, the required planarity has to be recovered by polishing the surface after installation and measurement of the table in the assembly room.
3. It is recommended to inspect the feet of the table regularly (every week). The load of the table must be only on the 3 kinematical supports; additional feet installed for security reasons must always be free of load (indicated by a loose nut). If this should not be the case, the feet have to be adjusted (best by professionals); chamber assembly can continue only after at least 2 days to allow for relaxation of the table to its original shape.

4. No installations on the table which are firmly connected to the floor.
5. Load on the table must not exceed the design value as specified by the manufacturer.
6. The surface of the granite may have to be cleaned before installation of the jigging. Cleaning should be done only with special fluid and cloth recommended by the manufacturer of the table.
7. The granite table must be kept under constant and uniform environmental conditions which are monitored continuously after setup and measurement as specified by the manufacturers. This includes: 1. Constant and uniform illumination (even with tubelayeron combs). 2. Constant relative humidity, typically \(50\pm 10\%\). 3. Constant and uniform temperature within \(\pm 0.5^{\circ}\)C long-term (monitored with temperature probes on the granite). 4. Temperature gradient between top and bottom of the table below \(0.2^{\circ}\)C (monitored with temperature probes on the granite).
8. The planarity of the granite table surface (where accessible) and the alignment of the jigging have to be measured regularly (initially every 3 months). Tilt meters are recommended for this purpose.

#### Assembly Tooling

The components of the assembly jigging are measured before or after the installation on the granite table:

1. \(z\)-distances and \(y\)-coordinates of cylinders in the V-grooves of the combs (on a 3D coordinate measureing machine).
2. Height of the sphere towers with the different interfaces (on a 3D coordinate measureing machine).
3. \(y\), \(z\) and angular alignment of the comb lines installed on the assembly table (with optical or mechanical gauges).
4. \(y\)-coordinates of the V-grooves of the end comb lines installed on the assembly table (using a feeler gauge) to make sure the combs have not been deformed by mounting them.

The alignment of the comb lines is measured in regular time intervals (typically 3 months which corresponds to the construction of about 6 chambers). The data are stored in the local production data bases for reference and tracing of errors.

The assembly jigging is visually inspected regularly and cleaned when necessary.

The following labelling of the assembly jigging is proposed:

1. Mark readout and high voltage side on assembly table.
2. Mark chamber coordinate system on granite table.
3. Mark sequential numbers of tube insertion on both end combs.
4. Mark reference side on assembly table.

5. Mark sphere support towers with numbers.
6. Mark tower with fixed sphere position.
7. Mark tower interfaces including correspondence to towers.
8. Mark identifiers of force compensation supports on granite table, corresponding with DB.
9. Mark location of transfer blocks for alignment platform positioning on combs.
10. Mark chamber identifier (ATLAS numbering scheme) on RO and HV cross plate outer surfaces and on protective covers.

During the 12 hour curing time of the glue for the assembly of a tube layer, the vacuum suction force of the tubes in the combs has to be continuously active and must not be lost in case of a power failure. Otherwise the accuracy of the tube layer cannot be guaranteed and the layer may have to be discarded. The vacuum underpressure is continuously monitored. Emergency power should be available. The reaction time depends on how long the vacuum system can maintain the underpressure with pump off.

### 6.2 Preparation of Chamber Components

Before entering the assembly room, all chamber components go through a final quality control procedure. The quality of the components is verified by consulting the quality control documentation by the suppliers and the information in the production data base (see the **Assembly Control Plan** in the **Appendix**).

All components, except for the drift tubes which are stored dust-free conditions, are carefully cleaned, the cleaning is verified and the components are properly labelled. All components are stored in the temperature controlled assembly room at least 12 hours before assembly in order to adapt to the temperature of 20\({}^{\circ}\)C.

The following labelling of components is proposed:

1. Mark readout and high-voltage side cross plates.
2. Mark orientation to top multilayer on all cross plates and long beams.
3. Mark identifiers of the in-plane alignment, cross plates sag and sphere monitors on the spacer corresponding with DB.
4. Mark locations of mask, lens and CCD of permanent and temporary RASNIK monitors on cross plates and long beams.

### 6.3 Qualification of Personell

The assembly of a chamber is carried out by 3 operators as described in the **Chamber Assembly Manual**.

Operator 3 coordinates the work in the assembly room and the preparation of materials, ensures that all assembly and quality control steps are performed correctly according to the **Assembly Control Plan** and operates the monitoring devices for assembly control with the help of the **Assembly Control Program**. He also operates the crane during assembly.

The operator team starts its work only after detailed instructions and training on all assembly and quality assurance procedures.

The Production Manager (physicist or engineer) supervises the whole chamber assembly process and makes sure that the quality assurance instructions are correctly followed. He evaluates the monitoring data and has to be consulted when alarms occur. Critical steps have to be approved by him as defined in the **Assembly Control Plan**. He is also responsible that the operators are correctly instructed and trained.

### 6.4 The Chamber Assembly Process

All steps of the MDT chamber construction procedures are described in detail in the **Chamber Assembly Manual** of each production site and, in addition, in associated manuals for specific components and procedures (**Assembly Monitoring Manual**, **Gas System Installation Manual**, **Glueing Manual**).

The detailed work and quality assurance plan for chamber assembly is described in the local **Assembly Control Plan** which to a large extent will be implemented in software, the **Assembly Control Program**, to control the process with the help of a computer which also acquires and analyzes the monitoring data.

#### Monitoring of Chamber Assembly

Monitoring and control of all critical parameters of the assembly process is essential to guarantee the quality and precision of the chambers, in particular since only a fraction of the chambers can be measured completely and with sufficient accuracy after construction. The monitoring and test data taken during assembly are kept in the local production data base for reference and tracing of problems. The following parameters are measured and monitored during chamber assembly (see Tables 5 and 6):

1. Climatization of the assembly room (temperature and relative humidity).
2. Temperature of the cross plates (with the temperature probes to be installed on the spacer) and of the end combs.
3. Vacuum underpressure for tubes suction in the combs.
4. Identification of each drift tube and its location in the chamber via the barcode using a barcode scanner. This includes automatic verification that the tube has been accepted by the quality control tests.
5. Uniform tube length and azimutal orientation of endplugs (by visual inspection).
6. Horizontal glue gap between tubes in combs (by visual inspection with illumination from underneath) to verify the tube straightness (relevant for the 100 \(\mu\)m tolerance on the wire concentricity with respect to the tube wall).
7. Height (in \(y\) coordinate) of endplug reference surface on the combs to verify proper fitting and suction of tubes in the combs. Measurement devices used are: feeler gauges, tilt meters or laser monitors (see Figure 10).
8. Uniform glue distribution with glue dispenser (visual inspection) and glue curing time.
9. Stability of the in-plane alignment monitor readings and of the planarity of the assembly jigging using the in-plane alignment system (RASNIK monitors).

10. Precision of the vertical stacking of tube layers in the \(y\) and \(z\) coordinates using proximity RASNIK monitors (sphere monitors) with large masks mounted close to the spheres at the 4 ends of the two outer cross plates and the in-plane alignment system for the middle cross plate.
11. Measurement of angular deviations \(\Delta\theta_{x}\), \(\Delta\theta_{y}\) and \(\Delta\theta_{z}\) (around the \(x\)-, \(y\)- and \(z\)-axes) of the axial/praxial and the projective alignment platforms from alignment with the axes of the chamber coordinate frame. The measurements are performed with an optical angle measuring device developed at Brandeis University (BCAM) and adapted for this purpose by Saclay (for relative alignment of platforms), and with feeler gauges and tilt meters after installation of the platforms and after assembly of each further tube layer.
12. Monitoring of the forces (measured with strain gauges) applied to the long beams by the automatic force compensation system which is used for the BM and BO chambers to compensate the gravitational sag of the cross plates when supported on the sphere towers during assembly.
13. Monitoring of the gravitational sag of the two outer cross plates during assembly and test of the chambers using RASNIK monitors temporarily installed on the cross plates between the long beams (recommended for the BM and BO chambers initially).
14. Regular verification of the planarity of the granite table and the alignment of the jigging (combs and sphere towers); see section **Assembly Tooling**.

The **Assembly Control Program** automatically generates alarms if any of the monitored parameters is outside the tolerances. Resulting actions are:

* Immediate corrections for the chamber currently under construction (see the **Assembly Control Plan** in the **Appendix**).
* The monitoring data are stored in the local production data base as reference for tracing of errors.
* If the deviations cannot be completely eliminated: The problem is reported and the data are recorded in the central data base; the chamber is flagged for measurement in the X-ray tomograph.

More details on assembly quality control and monitoring procedures are given in the **Monitoring Manual** and the **Assembly Control Plan** in the **Appendix**.

#### Calibration of the Optical Monitors

The optical monitoring devices require careful calibration (see the **Monitoring Manual**):

1. The angular orientation around the \(x\)-axis of the masks of the in-plane alignment RASNIK monitors relative to the surface of the assembly table has to be measured with an accuracy of 10 mrad for the barrel chambers. This allows to measure the gravitational sag (\(y\) displacement of the middle cross plate) of even the longest barrel chambers with an accuracy of 5 \(\mu\)m after compensation of the wire sag of up to 350 \(\mu\)m relative to the zero-readings of the in-plane monitors on the assembly jigging. The calibration can be done after assembly of the spacer by moving the middle cross plate supported on the sphere towers in \(z\) direction parallel to the surface of the granite table by about 1 mm and measuring the change in the \(y\) and \(z\) readings of the in-plane monitors.

The resolution in the angle measurement between mask and CCD around the \(x\)-axis by the RASNIK image analysis software is much better than 10 mrad and does not contribute to the error. The calibration data have to be stored in the central data base.
2. The zero-readings of the in-plane alignment RASNIK monitors on the flat granite table are needed as reference for the measurement of deformations of the chamber during assembly, test (in the cosmic ray test stand and the X-ray tomograph) and operation in the ATLAS detector. Readings of the in-plane monitors are taken as part of the chamber construction procedure after each glueing step, for assembly of the spacer and of the tube layers (see the **Appendix**). The readings have to be stable within \(\pm 10\)\(\mu\) m during the assembly of the chamber. The average or a selection of the readings is taken as zero-reading for the future operation of the chamber. The zero-readings of the in-plane alignment monitors and their readings after each glueing step are stored in the central data base.
3. The zero-readings of the RASNIK cross plates sag monitors are needed as reference for the measurement of the sag of the cross plates during assembly and test (in the cosmic ray test stand and the X-ray tomograph). The zero-readings are taken with the cross plates suspended at one end from a cranes such that there is no deformation. They can be verified by measuring the cross plates sag in the initial and inverted orientation of the spacer on the jigging after adjustment of the long beams on the middle cross plate (see the **Appendix**). The zero-readings of the cross plates sag monitors are stored in the local production data base.
4. The angular orientation around the \(x\)-axis of the masks of the RASNIK sphere monitors relative to the surface of the granite table has to be measured and regularly recalibrated with an accuracy of 50 \(\mu\)rad. This accuracy is needed in order to measure the \(y\) and \(z\) positions of the spheres (where the masks are mounted) with a precision of 5 \(\mu\)m over the measurement range of 52 mm for 3-layer chambers and 78 mm for 4-layer chambers. (The same is true for the reference sensors on the granite table for a laser sphere monitoring system with transparent MPA-ALMY sensors.) The calibration measurement can be done with a tilt meter on the granite table and and on the housing of the large mask in which it has been accurately aligned with respect to an external reference surface. Optical measurement of the mask orientation with a pendulum in front of it using a tilt meter to measure the orientation of the granite table has also been proposed. The angle measurement between mask and CCD around the \(x\)-axis by the RASNIK image analysis software has to be at least as accurate as the calibration in order not to increase significantly the \(y\) and \(z\) measurement error of the sphere monitors. Optimized RASNIK analysis programs have shown 30 \(\mu\)rad angular resolution. Once the angular orientation of the sphere monitor CCD has been precisely measured in this way with respect to the surface of the assembly table on which it is permanently mounted, the mask orientation on the sphere holders mounted on the next chamber can be measured the same way without calibration. Nevertheless, regular recalibration is necessary in order to be sure that the CCD holder has not moved. The calibration data are stored in the local production data base.

#### Glueing Procedures

The following glue types are used for chamber assembly:1. For spacer assembly, glueing of tube layers to the spacer and mounting of gas distribution bars: Ciba Geigy Araldite 2014 (AW 139/XB 5323) with high viscosity to fill the large glue gaps with shrinkage \(<1\%\), setting (usage) time of 40 minutes, curing time of 3.5 (5) hours to achieve minimum shear strength of 1 (10) N/mm\({}^{2}\) at 23\({}^{\circ}\)C on aluminum and a shelve time of 3 years at 18 - 25\({}^{\circ}\)C. As alternative with higher peeling strength, 3M Scotch-Weld DP 460 is under consideration which otherwise has similar properties as Araldite 2014 with about 1.5% shrinkage. The glue is applied with a manual glue dispenser with static mixer. It will be cured for 12 hours during chamber assembly.
2. For glueing of tubes on tubes: Ciba Geigy Araldite 2011 (AW 106/HV 953U) with viscosity of 40 - 45 Pa after mixing at 23\({}^{\circ}\)C, setting (handling) time of 105 minutes in glue container and 90 minutes exposed to air, curing time of 7 (10) hours to achieve minimum shear strength of 1 (10) N/mm\({}^{2}\) at 23\({}^{\circ}\)C on aluminum and a shelve time of 3 years at 18 - 25\({}^{\circ}\)C. The glue is applied in premixed form on a complete tube layer inserted in the assembly combs using an automatic glue dispenser with a speed of typically 20-30 minutes for a layer depending on chamber size which leaves enough reserve in case of problems. Up to 90 minutes glue handling time can be accepted with the proper control of out-of-plane deflections of tubes in the assembly process. Good control of the amount and location of the glue distributed on the tube layer by design of the glue dispenser is important to minimize glue shrinkage and out-of-plane deflections of tubes which can affect the mechanical accuracy of the chambers. The glue will be cured for 12 hours during chamber assembly. Handling of the premixed glue and the automatic glue dispensers is described in the **Glueing Manual**.
3. For glueing of alignment platforms, Faraday cage mounting bars, in-plane alignment monitor components, temperature and B-field sensors: Ciba Geigy Araldite 2012 (AW 2104/ HW 2934) with viscosity as Araldite 2011, setting (usage) time of 5 minutes, curing time of 20 (105) minutes to achieve minimum shear strength of 1 (10) N/mm\({}^{2}\) at 23\({}^{\circ}\)C on aluminum and a shelve time of 3 years at 18 - 25\({}^{\circ}\)C.

All surfaces glued must be cleaned with alcohol and dried before glueing according to the glue handling specifications. This includes the components of the spacer, the gas system, Faraday cages, on-chamber monitors and alignment platforms. The tubes are stored and transported in air-tight bags at all times aftercleaning by the manufacturer. The bags are only opened and packed inside the clean rooms for tube assembly and test and for chamber assembly at the production sites. The tubes are handled with plastic gloves only in order to avoid contamination. If nevertheless tubes get contaminated by dust or grease etc., they have to be carefully cleaned with ethanol without destroying the barcode and bending the tubes. Details about the glueing processes during chamber assembly and the associated quality assurance are described in the **Chamber Assembly Manual** and the **Glueing Manual**. For each glueing step, an aluminum test piece is glued simultaneously from the same glue mixture as used for the chamber assembly to evaluate independently the proper curing of the glue. The glue on the chamber is inspected after the nominal curing time. If the glue should not cure as required even after an extended time period, the tube layer or even the whole chamber have to be discarded depending on the assembly step.

#### Assembly Control Plan

The **Assembly Control Plan** contains detailed instructions for quality assurance and quality control during the construction of a MDT chamber.

An example for the construction of BOS MDT chambers is given in the **Appendix**. The plan is intended as guideline for the preparation of the local QA/QC plan and for the implementation of the QA/QC procedures in an **Assembly Control Program**.

#### Assembly Control Program

Following the specifications in the **Assembly Control Plan**, the **Assembly Control Program** allows to verify all major assembly steps, acquires and analyzes the data of the monitoring devices, stores the data in the local production data base and issues alarms if parameters are out of tolerances. In most cases the control program will be based on the LABVIEW package.

The schematical layout of an **Assembly Control Program** is shown in Figure 11. Figure 12 shows an example of a graphical user interface for the control program.

## 7 Chamber Test

The following quality control tests are performed for each chamber at the production sites immediately after assembly to provide fast feed back (see Tables 7 and 8):

1. Tests of chamber mechanics on the kinematical supports: 1. Measurement of the gravitational sag of the chamber before and after sag compensation with the in-plane alignment monitors. 2. Measurement of the gravitational deformation of the cross plates with the cross plate sag monitors (recommended for BM and BO chambers).
2. Gas pressure and leak test of the whole chamber.
3. High voltage stability test with mounted electronics. 1. Leakage current measurement. 2. Cosmic count rate measurement (optional).
4. Evaluation of performance in cosmic ray test stand.

The following tests are performed for each chamber after transport to CERN and during chamber storage (see Table 9):

1. Acceptance test at CERN: visual inspection.
2. Acceptance test at CERN: gas leak test.
3. Monitoring of gas pressure in sealed chambers over storage time.
4. If final readout electronics installed during storage: high voltage stability test and operation test of electronics.

The following tests are performed for selected chambers after transport to CERN and during chamber storage (see Table 10):

1. Measurement of wire coordinates with the CERN X-ray tomograph.
2. Monitoring of wire tension in one chamber per production site over storage time.
3. Monitoring of drift tube ground contact in one chamber per production site over storage time.

Details of the chamber quality control tests are described in the following. Examples of the test sequence are given in the sections Chamber Test Program at the Production Sites and Chamber Test Program at CERN.

### Gas Pressure and Leak Test

Immediately after assembly, the chambers with in-chamber gas distribution system have to be pressure tested at an overpressure of 3 bar which is 1.5 times the nominal overpressure of 2 bar used during chamber operation.

After the pressure test, the complete chamber is tested for gas leaks at the nominal overpressure of 2 bar with an inert gas. For the same reasons as explained for the single-tube leak test, the leak rate of a complete chamber including the gas distribution system has to be below \(2\cdot 10^{-8}\) barl/s pertube.

The leak rate is determined by monitoring the pressure drop and together with the temperature difference between the chamber and a gas tight reference volume (see Figures 13 and 14). With the sensitivities of differential manometers (\(\Delta p/p=10^{-4}-10^{-5}\)) and calibrated temperature sensors (0.1\({}^{\circ}\)C) distributed on the chamber (permanent or temporary ones) and on the reference volume, the test takes several days in order to be able to detect a pressure drop in the chamber corresponding to the required leak rate limit.

The duration of the test is limited by the accuracy of the temperature monitoring. The reference volumes should be close to the chamber and thermally coupled to it to minimize temperature differences. The temperature of the chamber should be uniform. Performing the test in a temperature controlled room helps to accelerate it.

The same leak test is performed as acceptance test after delivery of the chamber to CERN. During the whole storage time, the chambers stay filled with the baseline gas at 3 bar and the gas pressure is monitored with cheap manometers together with the temperature.

Contact addresses for differential manometers for the test are: JINR Dubna (see Figure 14) and Brandeis University.

All test results including history are recorded in the local production data base for reference and tracing of problems. The leak rate limit and faulty tube identifiers are stored in the central data base.

### High Voltage Stability Test

After installation of the high voltage and readout boards at the production sites, a high voltage stability test is performed with the baseline gas at 3 bar. The leakage current per channel should be below 2 nA/m +5 nA at 8 times the nominal gas gain. For Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) (93:7) gas mixture, this corresponds to a test high voltage of 3400 V. The high voltage is ramped up carefully as for the single-tube high voltage test where the current per channel is limited to be below 2 nA/m +5 nA.

Optionally, the cosmic count rate per tube at the nominal operating point is measured and recorded in the local data base.

The high voltage stability test is repeated after installation of the final readout electronics which for a large fraction of the chambers has to take place in the storage area after the chamber test at the production sites. For these chambers, also a minimum operation test of the final electronics has to be performed which is practical with the setup in the storage area (e.g. without external cosmic trigger). It includes test of all electronics interconnections with pulser, verification of signals from all tubes, measurement of noise level, random rate and uniformity of response.

All test results including history are recorded in the local production data base for reference and tracing of problems. The results of the high voltage stability test, including faulty tube identifiers, are recorded in the central data base.

### 7.3 Cosmic Ray Test Stand

The performance of each chamber is evaluated in a cosmic ray test stand at the production site with the baseline gas at the nominal operating point. One or several chambers simultaneously are tested in a tower with trigger chambers (see Figure 15). The chambers are installed with their kinematical supports on rails as in the ATLAS detector. The in-plane alignment system, cross plates sag monitors if existing and the temperature sensors on the chambers should be continuously active.

Chambers are accepted after all channels have shown the expected performance stable over a period of 1-2 weeks. The measurements are stored in the local data base. Examples of parameters to be monitored are: drift tube efficiency, noise level, random rate, maximum drift time, resolution as a function of \(x\), local wire displacements and uniformity of all channels.

Faulty drift tubes discovered during the operation of the chamber are recorded in the central data base.

### 7.4 Wire Location Measurement in Cosmic Ray Teststands

Several cosmic ray teststands in preparation for the barrel chambers (see Figure 15) allow to test 3 or more chambers simultaneously in horizontal orientation. By selecting high-momentum particles with a lead absorber and using the two outerchambers with precisely known wire locations (e.g. from X-ray tomograph measurement) as reference for the reconstruction of tracks of cosmic rays in the tower, the wire locations in the tested chamber in the middle can be reconstructed. Useful information about the wire positioning accuracy and possible systematic shifts can be obtained already after a data taking time of typically 10 hours. Second coordinate measurement of the tracks with accuracy of typically 1 cm is needed.

The 3 chambers are aligned with respect to each other with tracks. Rotations between the MDT chambers and between MDT and second coordinate chambers around the vertical \(y\) axis must be limited by construction of the rail support system of the chambers in the same way as in the ATLAS muon spectrometer. The tolerances for the rotation angles depend linearly on the second coordinate resolution; for a second coordinate resolution of 1 cm, the rotation angles \(\theta_{y}\) must be smaller than 1 mrad in order not to deteriorate significantly the first-coordinate resolution.

During the measuring time, the relative chamber alignment has to be stable and is monitored with optical sensors.

Simulations show that after half a day of data taking, the wire locations in the horizontal \(z\) coordinate can be measured with an accuracy of \(10-50\,\mu\)m depending on the setup. The measurement accuracy is limited by systematics from autocalibration and alignment stability. Tests will be performed with the Barrel DATCHA test stand at CERN.

For measurement of the wire \(y\) coordinates, the acceptance for cosmic tracks in a horizontal tower is limited; a reconstruction accuracy of typically \(50-100\)\(\mu\)m is expected under the above conditions.

The average \(y\)-pitch and the separation between multilayers can be measured with considerably higher precision. The statistics can be improved by rotating the tested chamber around the \(x\)-axis. More detailed studies are in progress.

For the endcap chambers, the feasibility of measuring wire locations in a configuration where the test chamber is oriented vertically, with wires horizontal as at \(\phi=0\) in the ATLAS detector, will be investigated.

The wire coordinate measurements and the measurement errors of the tested chamber are recorded in the local and central data bases.

### 7.5 Wire Tension Measurement

During the storage time, in one chamber per production site the wire tension (oscillation frequency) is monitored for a large fraction of the drift tubes to obtain information about the long-term behaviour. Devices for practical wire oscillation frequency measurement in complete chambers have been developed at JINR Dubna (excitation in a magnetic field) and at LNF Frascati (electrostatic excitation).

### 7.6 The CERN X-Ray Tomograph

The X-ray tomograph at CERN (see Figure 16) scans a whole chamber horizontally with two X-ray sources under a stereo angle of \(30^{\circ}\) to measure the wire positions in a global coordinate system in the \(y-z\) plane. The shadows of the wires in all layers are reconstructed on the X-ray detector images.

The X-ray tomograph has been tested with recent MDT prototype chambers. The results of a typical X-ray scan of the BOS prototype chamber (along the readout side) are shown in Figure 17: distributions of the residuals of the measured wire positions with respect to a fitted ideal grid including correction for the observed gravitational deformation of the readout-side cross plate due to external moments (sag by \(-17\)\(\mu\)m for this scan). The fitted parameters \(y\)- and \(z\)-pitch and \(y\)-separation between multilayers agree well within the measurement errors with the expectation from the construction of the assembly jigging. From repeated scans at the same position and for the same orientation of the chamber in the tomograph one estimates the measuring accuracy of the X-ray tomograph to be about 5 \(\mu\)m rms in \(z\) and 10 \(\mu\)m rms in \(y\) direction. This is sufficient to verify the accuracy of the MDT chambers.

The CERN X-ray tomograph provides a scan capacity of typically one chamber per week including the chamber setup time. This allows to measure a fraction of about 15% of all chambers built. Initially, approximately the same fraction will be measured for each production site.

The purpose of the X-ray tomograph measurements of MDT chambers is to

* qualify production sites with the scan results of the module 0 chambers,
* verify the mechanical accuracy of the chambers on the basis of a sample test,
* provide feed back to the production sites about systematic deviations from the mechanical specifications,
* measure the coordinates of all wires in chambers flagged for the X-ray tomograph because of problems discovered during assembly or transport.

After measurement in the X-ray tomograph, the wire coordinates of a chamber are known with higher accuracy than specified for the chamber construction. The fraction of scanned chambers therefore will be used in the ATLAS detector even if outside the mechanical tolerances. Only in exceptional cases chambers will have to be discarded because of large distortions detected by the X-ray measurements. Chambers with cutouts in the multilayers require special attention in the X-ray tomograph measurement schedule.

The barrel chambers are installed in the tomograph with their kinematical supports and on rails as in the ATLAS detector. External moments deforming the chamber must be avoided. The endcap chambers have to be mounted in a special support frame for the horizontal scan. The temperature in the X-ray tomograph room is controlled to be \(20\pm 0.5^{\circ}\)C as on the assembly table. The temperature of the chamber is monitored during the measurements with an accuracy of 0.1\({}^{\circ}\)C. Each scan is performed twice in order to test the reproducibility of the measurement and to verify bad wire positions.

The measurements are performed for 3 bar gas pressure in the chamber; for module 0 chambers also at 1 bar to determine the effect of the pressure on the positioning of the alignment platforms.

Repeating the scan at the same \(x\)-position after inverting the chamber around the \(x\)-axis helps to disentangle gravitational deformations of the cross plates on the supports from wire displacements caused during chamber construction. This will be done for the characterization of the module 0 chambers. Additional information about cross plate deformations during the X-ray scans is provided by cross plates sag monitors. The mechanical stability of the cross plates and the effect on the wire positioning accuracy after the chamber assembly should get special attention in the X-ray tomograph measurements of all types of module 0 chambers.

The X-ray tomograph measurements provide the following information:

1. \(y\) and \(z\) coordinates of all wires at the tubed ends (in active scan mode) at known temperature including extra scans at the \(x\)-position of cutouts. This allows to recover chambers outside the mechanical tolerances.
2. \(y\) and \(z\) coordinates of wires embedded in special gauge blocks mounted on the alignment platforms to verify their positioning accuracy.
3. Parameters extracted from the wire coordinate measurements on readout and high-voltage side for evaluation of the quality of the chamber and of the construction procedure: 1. Average \(z\) pitch. 2. \(z\)-pitch for each layer. 3. Average \(y\)-pitch. 4. \(y\)-distance between adjacent layers. 5. \(y\)-distance between multilayers. 6. \(z\)-shift between adjacent layers. 7. \(z\)-shift between multilayers. 8. Global deformations of the chamber in the \(y-z\) plane (fit vs. cross plate monitor measurements). 1. Systematic deformations of individual layers in the \(y-z\) plane (fit vs. cross plate monitor measurements). 2. Rms of the residual distributions of the measured wire coordinates with respect to the nominal wire grid in \(y\) and \(z\). 3. Rms of the residual distributions of the measured wire coordinates with respect to the nominal wire grid in \(y\) and \(z\), separate for each layer. 4. Deviations of residuals from Gaussian distribution; number of wires outside \(\pm 3\sigma\).

The X-ray tomograph data, wire coordinates, analyzed mechanical parameters and the temperature of the chamber for the different scans, are stored in the central data base.

## 8 Chamber Transport and Storage

Chambers are transported and stored in the following condition:

1. The chambers are transported and stored with Faraday cages (protection of the endplugs) and protective covers (protection of the tubes) installed.
2. The chambers are transported and stored suspended on their kinematical supports in a special frame inside a closed container.
3. After test at the production sites, the chambers are kept filled with the baseline gas at 3 bar during all further transport and storage.
4. The chambers are enclosed in an air-tight plastic bag containing dehumidifier bags.
5. The temperature of the chambers is monitored during transport and storage. Temperature gradients on the chamber must not exceed 10\({}^{\circ}\)C during transport and storage to prevent mechanical deformations.
6. During transport, only temperature variations in the range \(0-50^{\circ}\)C are allowed. (This means that the wire tension can increase temporarily by up to 45 g (1.5 g/\({}^{\circ}\)C) compared to the nominal tension of 350 g at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C, i.e. by 13%. The supports in the transport frame have to be able to cope with length variations of the chambers of up to 0.5 cm.)
7. During storage, the temperature has to stay within the range \(10-30^{\circ}\)C.
8. Shocks are limited during transport and are monitored during transports to CERN.

## 9 Monitoring of Chamber Production

The quality control data for chamber materials, drift tube production and chamber construction will be stored in the production data base in order to monitor the production and identify the source of problems at each production site and for the whole collaboration. It is important to keep track of the history and time relations of the quality control and monitoring measurements performed during chamber construction. Each individual tube is identified by a barcode which is read directly into the data base with a bar code scanner everytime the tube is handled in the construction process.

### Central Production Data Base

Data relevant for the global monitoring of the chamber production and for the later operation of the chambers are kept in the central production data base. Each production site is required to report the necessary data as soon as they are available. The data base will be implemented using the Microsoft ACCESS package, a relational data base for Windows, and will be maintained by the Rome MDT group. The content and structure of the central data base as far as quality control information is concerned are described in Table 11. An ACCESS data base template and instructions for the implementation are available at

[http://multifx.romal.infn.it/atlas/rmwork](http://multifx.romal.infn.it/atlas/rmwork).

In the ACCESS data base structure, each object is associated with a table. The following objects have been defined for the central MDT production data base: 'Tube', 'Layer', 'Multilayer', 'Spacer' and 'Chamber' tables. The rows of the table correspond to the different datentries related to the object ('items') and the columns ('fields') contain the data associated with each item. Relationships between different tables are defined via a common field ('primary key') in the linked tables.

### Local Production Data Base

The history of the quality control tests and the full monitoring data (see the **Assembly Control Plan** in the **Appendix**) have to be kept in the local production data bases of the production sites. These data are essential for reference and tracing of problems. It is recommended to keep as much information as possible. The suggested minimum content with a possible ACCESS structure of the local data base is described in Table 12. A template for implementation in ACCESS is available at

[http://multifx.romal.infn.it/atlas/rmwork](http://multifx.romal.infn.it/atlas/rmwork).

The **Assembly Control Program** communicates directly with the local ACCESS data base.
