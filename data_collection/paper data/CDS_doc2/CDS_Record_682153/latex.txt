**Abstract**

In this note we continue our discussion on the hard photons in the \(t\bar{t}\)_production_

and _decay_ as a background for the intermediate Higgs search at LHC experiment. We include full cascade in our simulation and study the effects of lepton and photon isolation cuts and the QCD shower on the simulated \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background.

Introduction

Let us recapitulate briefly our main results presented in [1].

We have proposed a strategy for including QED bremsstrahlung in the \(t\bar{t}\) production and decays.

As utility Monte Carlo to generate QED radiative corrections we proposed to use the package PHOTOS [2] combined with a basic physics Monte Carlo such as PYTHIA 56 [3]. To verify the accuracy of this solution, we have constructed an exact matrix element Monte Carlo, TOPKI, which simulates \(pp\to t\bar{t}(\gamma)(\gamma)X\) processes. We have checked that PHOTOS reproduces the relevant experimental distributions with a precision of 10% for moderate experimental cuts.

We have performed a simple analysis of the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background. In our simulation we have included only leptons from semileptonic decay of \(W\), photons emitted from \(t\bar{t}\) quarks (photons from _production_) and photons emitted from \(W\to\ell\nu\) decay (photons from _decay_). For the first time, photon radiation in the \(t\bar{t}\) production and decay have been generated simultaneously. These photons contribute to the background for the Higgs search by a factor of 10 more than photons emitted in the \(t\bar{t}\) production alone. Even after additional cuts on the minimal photon-lepton mass \(M^{\gamma\ell}\), the background from photons radiated in \(t\bar{t}\) production and decay is on the level of the background from photons radiated _only_ in the production, and therefore increases the background from the top events by a factor of 2 with respect to previous estimates [4].

In this note we discuss topics which have not been covered in [1]: effect of QCD final state shower on photons emitted from top quarks, photon emission from \(t\to Wb\), full hadronic cascade simulation with photons originating from fragmentation, and isolation cut for photons and leptons.

The new version of PHOTOS 2.0, which includes modifications necessary for simulation of this process, has been released recently [5]. We have reproduced all benchmarks included in [1] with this new version. This version is used for simulations presented in this note.

Please note that the default version of PHOTOS does not generate QED radiation in branch which includes quark, gluon, string, diquark, etc. The \(gg(q\bar{q})\to t\bar{t}\) process is the only exception.

## 2 Effect of the QCD final state shower from \(t\bar{t}\) quarks

In the study presented previously we did not discuss the problem of the interplay of QED photon radiation and QCD final state shower from \(t\bar{t}\) quarks.

The problem of QCD shower and its influence on the QED photon radiation was studied for the light quarks with the high precision LEP data (see papers by P. Mattig [6]). There are two effects of QCD shower which disturb the QED photon emission from quarks. The first one is the so called "time" ordering of QCD shower and QED radiation. Its consequence is the competition between photon and gluon emission. The second is the energy scale \(Q_{0}\) of photon and gluon emission cut off and non-separation of QCD infrared singularities from QED ones. A more detailed discussion of these problems can be found in [7]. In general the interplay of QCD shower and QED emission can lead to the reduction of photon spectrum in the very hard photon region even by a factor of 2 [8].

However these effects are not expected to be as important for photon/gluon radiation from top because its mass is large ( \(m_{t}>113\) GeV [9]). The reason is that the natural scale energy cut off \(Q_{0}\) is the quark mass (see [8]) so the probability for QCD branching to take place is thus not very high. We have checked with the QCD parton shower implementation in PYTHIA ( the photon emission in PYTHIA switched off) that for \(m_{t}=140\) GeV and \(pp\) energy 16 TeV the probability for final state QCD shower to take place in the hard process \(gg\to t\bar{t}\) is small. Only in 2% of events the invariant mass of \(t\bar{t}\) pair is reduced by more than 20% as a consequence of this shower. This can be compared with the similar simulation for the b quark production where the reduction of \(b\bar{b}\) pair invariant mass by more than 20% was found in 20% of events. Fig. 1. presents the reduction of \(q\bar{q}\) invariant mass by QCD shower for \(pp(gg)\to t\bar{t}(\mbox{\it shower})\) and \(pp(gg)\to b\bar{b}(\mbox{\it shower})\) processes.

Therefore we conclude that the interplay of photon and gluon emission from top quarks is not significant. However we have made a comparison to estimate this effect. To this end we have considered two extreme option of photon-gluon ordering. In the first one we have radiated photons (by PHOTOS) before final state QCD shower was executed by PYTHIA, in second option we have radiated photons after QCD shower. We have looked at the photon \(p_{T}\) (in the frame of hard process) and \(\eta\) distributions. Results are presented on Fig. 2a and 2b, where solid line denotes distribution if photons were emitted before final state shower and points if photons were emitted after final state shower. The distributions are normalized to the total number of generated \(gg\to t\bar{t}\gamma\) events. No difference is observed on the level of required precision. Therefore we decided to implement QED emission (by PHOTOS) from \(t\bar{t}\) quarks before QCD shower is executed by PYTHIA.

We have studied here only the kinematical effects on the photon emission from the QCD shower. As usually, higher order QCD corrections should be included as a \(K\) factor in the overall normalization of the cross section.

Photon emission in top decay \(t\to Wb\)

The photon emission in the decay \(t\to Wb\) is not simulated by PHOTOS generator. The main reason is that (as can be concluded from Fig. 1 in previous section) in this case we cannot separate photon emission and gluon emission from b quarks in the description of this phenomena. However we expect the contribution from the photons from the \(t\to Wb\gamma\) radiation to be not significant. The reason is that with \(m_{t}=140GeV\) and \(M_{W}\sim 80GeV\), \(m_{b}\sim 5GeV\) there is not much phase space left for emission of hard photons.

We have estimated the effect of this radiation. We have performed simulation (see Table 1) switching on photon emission for branch \(t\to Wb\) in PHOTOS and without QCD shower from b quarks.

**Table 1:**_The cross-section for the signature \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) in the pp \(\to t\bar{t}X\) process. The pp \(\to t\bar{t}X\) process is generated by the default version of PYTHIA 56. The package PHOTOS is used to generate single/double bremsstrahlung in gg(q\bar{q}) \(\to t\bar{t}\) process \((\gamma_{h})\)and to generate single photon bremsstrahlung in semileptonic \(W\) decay \((\gamma_{W})\). In the case of \((\gamma_{W,t-Wb})\) we switched on also radiation in the branch \(t\to Wb\) but without QCD final state shower from the \(b\) quark so this contribution is overestimated. The proton-proton rest frame energy is \(\sqrt{s}=16000\) GeV, \(m_{t}=140\) GeV and \(\alpha_{e}=1/137\).

The numbers presented in Table 1 increase by \(10\%-20\%\) if the QED emission in branch \(t\to Wb\) is allowed. This \(20\%\) should be reduced by the final state QCD shower from b quark. So for the time being we think that this effect can be neglected. But the contribution from this decay channel will increase with increasing of the top mass.

## 4 Energy deposition for leptons and photons

Now let us switch on, full hadronic cascade in our simulation. We generate QED radiative photons by PHOTOS in full cascade but the overhelming fraction of all photons in the multihadronic events comes from the decay of unstable particles, such as \(\pi^{0}\) and \(\eta\). Since these photons are found almost exclusively inside jets, cuts on isolation have to be used to eliminate them from the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background. Also the additional leptons coming from the semileptonic decays of hadrons can be removed from the background by this cut.

In the following we will present the energy deposition distribution for leptons and photons, coming from the different sources, as found from the generator PYTHIA. We define the isolation cone \(R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta^{2}}=0.2\) for each photon/lepton and sum over transverse energy \(E_{T}=\sqrt{p_{x}^{2}+p_{y}^{2}}\) deposited by particles which have been found in this cone. We sum over energy deposition of all stable particles excluding neutrinos. We consider only leptons and photons with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV and \(\eta<2.5\). In Table. 2a and 2b we collected the results of the simulation of \(N_{events}=4\cdot 10^{4}\). We collected separately photons from different sources : \(t\bar{t}\) production, \(W\to\ell v\) decay and hadronic cascade. Also we considered separately leptons from \(W\to\ell v\) decay and leptons from hadronic cascade. The initial and final QCD radiation was switched on (switched off for numbers in brackets).

\begin{tabular}{|l||l|l|} \hline Cuts & \(\ell\) from \(W\to l\nu\) & \(\ell\) from cascade \\ \hline \(p_{T}^{\ell}>\)25 GeV & & & \\ \(\eta^{\ell}<2.5\) & 19 276 (18 953) & 3458 (4206) \\ \hline \(p_{T}^{\ell}>\)25 GeV & & & \\ \(\eta^{\ell}<2.5\) & 13 228 (13 217) & 173 (266) \\ \(E_{dep,R=0.2}^{\ell}<10\) GeV & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{||l||c|c|c|c||} \hline Cuts & \(\gamma\) from \(t\bar{t}\) & \(\gamma\) from \(W\rightarrow\ell\nu\) & \(\gamma\) from cascade \\ \hline \(p_{T}^{\gamma}>\)25 GeV & & & & \\ \(\eta^{\gamma}<\) 2.5 & 106 (104) & 260 (258) & 7643 (7307) \\ \hline \(p_{T}^{\gamma}>\)25 GeV & & & & \\ \(\eta^{\gamma}<\) 2.5 & 101 (103) & 95 (113) & 74 (144) \\ \(E_{dep,R=0.2}^{\gamma}<\) 10 GeV & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

After the isolation cut 75% of leptons from \(W\rightarrow\ell\nu\) but only 6% of leptons from hadronic cascade are accepted. Inclusion of QCD initial and final state shower reduces the number of leptons from cascade which pass the trigger. Only less than 2% of all accepted leptons after isolation cut come from hadronic cascade. We can conclude, from Table 2, that because of isolation cut leptons coming from hadronic cascade do not contribute to the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background. This fact can be used to increase the efficiency of simulation, namely one of the \(W\)'s can be forced to decay semileptonicaly and then the number of generated events can be divided by the branching fraction \(\Gamma_{W\rightarrow\ell\nu}\). The isolation cut does not change contribution of photons from \(t\bar{t}\) in the total sample but reduces by more than 2 contribution of photons from \(W\rightarrow\ell\nu\). Only 1% of photons from the hadronic cascade are accepted after isolation cut (but it is still on the level of accepted photons from \(W\) or \(t\bar{t}\)). The inclusion of QCD initial and final state shower does not increase efficiency of isolation cut for photons from \(W\rightarrow\ell\nu\) decay but reduces the number of accepted photons from hadronic cascade roughly by factor 2. As the dominant fraction of accepted photons from hadronic cascade comes from \(\pi^{0}\) and \(\eta\) decays it can be also reduced due to the \(\pi^{0}\), \(\eta\) rejection in hadronic calorimeter. On Fig. 3a we present the distribution of the energy deposition \(E_{dep}\) for leptons and on Fig. 3b for photons coming from different sources. The initial and final state QCD shower was switched on.

The QCD shower is switched off and results are not corrected for this effect._

From Table 3 it can be seen that for chosen value of isolation cut and \(M_{min}^{\gamma\ell}\) cut, they are both important to reduce the background.

## 5 Additional results from the simulation of the radiative \(t\bar{t}\) channel.

In the following we will present results of the "full" simulation. We generate \(pp\to t\bar{t}\to X\) process by PYTHIA 56 (ISUB=81 and ISUB=82). After hard process is executed (subroutine PYSCAT) we executes PHOTOS on the generated \(gg(q\bar{q})\to t\bar{t}\) event with parameters ISEC=.TRUE. (double bremsstrahlung option) and XPHCUT=0.001 (infrared cut-off for photons). Then the remaining parts of PYTHIA are executed on the \(t\bar{t}(\gamma)(\gamma)\) event which is followed by PHOTOS execution on the full hadronic cascade with parameters ISEC=.FALSE. and XPHCUT=0.01. Because of the problem with CPU we decided to skip initial and final state QCD shower execution in PYTHIA (this will be corrected using information from Table 2a and Table 2b) but we keep hadronization of the cascade. For each event we selected leptons and photons which fulfilled following conditions \(p_{T}^{\gamma,\ell}>25\) GeV, \(\eta<2.5\), \(E_{dep,R=0.2}^{\gamma,\ell}<10\) GeV. If we accepted at least 1 lepton and at least 2 photons in theevent, event was stored and the efficiency on the remaining possible cuts was tested. The Table 4 below present final results. The origin of photons are specified.

Taking into account, that photons from hadronic cascade (\(\gamma_{all}\gamma_{e}\ell\)) will be reduced due to \(\pi^{0}\), \(\eta\) rejection in calorimeter, we do not expect significant increases of the background from this additional source (however it cannot be neglected in the analysis).

**Table 4**: _The number of collected \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background events from \(\mathbf{L}\)= \(10[fb]^{-1}\) generated pp \(\to t\bar{t}\to X\) events is given. Different cuts are specified. The \(\gamma_{h}\) denotes photons from \(t\bar{t}\), \(\gamma_{W}\) photons from \(W\to\ell\nu\) and \(\gamma_{e}\) photons from hadronic cascade. The number of \(\gamma_{all}\gamma_{e}\ell\) is still to be reduced by \(\pi^{0}\), \(\eta\) rejection. (This simulation was performed with QCD shower switched off but respective reducing factors from Table 2a, 2b ( \(0.85\) for events \((\gamma_{h}\gamma_{W}\ell)\), \(0.85^{2}\) for events \((\gamma_{W}\gamma_{W}\ell)\) and \(0.5\) for events \((\gamma_{all}\gamma_{e}\ell)\) ) are included in presented numbers._If one compare numbers from Table 4 with Fig. 5 from [1] the very strong reduction of the \((\gamma_{t},\gamma_{t})\) and \((\gamma_{t},\gamma_{W})\) background (\(\sim 50\%\)) due to the \(E_{de\,p,R=0.2}<10GeV\) cut is observed.

## 6 Summary

In this note we have discussed few additional aspects of the \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) background. We have included full hadronic cascade in the simulation, studied the effect of isolation cuts and final state QCD shower. The general conclusion is that inclusion of hadronic cascade + isolation cuts does not change results from [1], i.e. that background to \(\gamma\gamma\ell\) signature from \(t\bar{t}\) radiation alone increases by factor 2 (up to statistical fluctuations) if additional sources of photons from the decay product of \(t\bar{t}\) are included. The isolation cut \(E_{dep,R=0.2}<10GeV\) reduces the background estimation presented in [1] by \(\sim 50\%\). After isolation cut, the \(M_{min}^{\gamma\ell}\) cut still rejects background. We expect photons from hadronic cascade to be strongly (completely? ) eliminated from the background by isolation cut and \(\pi^{0}\), \(\eta\) rejection in the calorimeter.

It is very difficult to compare results presented here and in [1] with results from [10] as the PYTHIA's options (e.g. structure functions, evolution energy scale) and triggers definitions (e.g. isolation ) are not consistently used.

However it can be concluded that the radiative \(t\bar{t}\) channel contribute on the same level as the direct \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) channel to the background. Therefore respective numbers in Table 4 (from ref. [10] add. 2) for \(t\bar{t}\gamma\gamma\) channel should be multiplied by factor of 2 (2.2?) to include the effect of radiative \(t\bar{t}\) decays. It will leads to the 14 background events/mass bin ( \(M_{H}=80\) GeV) and 8.5 background events/mass bin (\(M_{H}=110\) GeV). The significance will be therefore reduced to the 3.8 (instead of 4.2) and 6.2 (instead of 6.9) for the \(M_{H}=80\) GeV and \(M_{H}=110\) GeV respectively. But please note that this is only very rough estimation of the effect due to the lack of the consistency in the simulation presented here and in [10].
