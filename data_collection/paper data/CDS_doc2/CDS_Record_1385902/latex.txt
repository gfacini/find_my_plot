###### Abstract

Cosmic-ray muon data collected in 2008, 2009 and 2010 have been used in the ATLAS experiment to test the calibration of the hadronic calorimeter, TileCal. The analysis was based on the comparison between experimental and simulated data, and addresses three issues. First, upper limits on the average non-uniformity of the response of the cells within a layer were estimated to be about \(\pm\)2%. Second, the response of the third longitudinal layer of the Barrel differs from those of the first and second Barrel layers by about 4 and 3 sigma, respectively. The responses of all the other layer pairs are consistent. Finally, the differences between the energy scales of each layer obtained in this analysis and the value set at test beams using electrons were found to range between -3% and +1%. The sources of uncertainties in the response measurements are strongly correlated, and include the uncertainty in the simulation of the muon response. The total error of each layer determination represented by the value of the diagonal elements of the error matrix is equal to about 2%. Stable response values were obtained for the three data-taking periods. The uncertainties on the comparisons are less than \(\pm\)1% for the Barrel layers and less than \(\pm\)3% for the Extended Barrel ones.

Introduction

Cosmic-ray muon events were collected by the ATLAS experiment [1] between September and October 2008, in June and October 2009 and in February, March and June 2010. The data have been used to validate the calibration of the hadronic calorimeter TileCal [2]. The inter-calibration of the different calorimeter cells was obtained by equalizing the photomultiplier (PMT) current induced by movable radioactive \({}^{137}\)Cs sources [3] that cross every row of scintillating tiles near the edges (see Figs. 1 and 2). Since the scintillating tile response depends on the impact point position of the particle in the tile and on its size, correction factors were applied for each layer of the calorimeter. Those values were determined from test beam data, measuring the response to muons impinging on the center of each tile-row at 90\({}^{\circ}\) (parallel to the beam direction in ATLAS) [4]. The calorimeter response scale used in ATLAS, referred to as the electromagnetic (\(EM\)) energy scale, is set by adjusting the PMT gain to reproduce the PMT's current of a reference \({}^{137}\)Cs source to the level it had during the tests with electron beams, where the conversion factor pC/GeV was fixed and measured [4]. Analogously the response of simulated electrons is used in ATLAS to fix the energy scale of the Monte Carlo (MC) jets. The full hardware procedure is monitored using a pulsing laser system [5] that checks the PMT gain stability and a system for charge injection pulses (CIS) [5] that measures the pC/ADC conversion factors for each channel of the fast readout used for physics and laser data. The same CIS reference voltages are used to inter-calibrate the slow integrator read-out used to measure the \({}^{137}\)Cs current in each PMT.

The holes of the radioactive source tubes that traverse all the eleven radial tile-rows parallel to the colliding beams are also shown.

The calibration strategy outlined briefly above is in principle straightforward but is technically quite convoluted. The studies of cosmic-ray muons provide an independent and direct method to cross-check the procedure and quantify possible residual systematics in a very clean environment. The interaction of muons with matter is well understood. The bulk of the cosmic-ray muons have an energy below 100 GeV. At such energies, the dominant energy loss process is ionization [6] and the energy lost is essentially proportional to the muon track path length. The response of the detector has been studied determining the ratio between the energy deposited in a calorimeter cell (\(dE\)) and the track path-length in the cell (\(dl\)). The experimental setup is described in Section 2. The most relevant details of the Tile Calorimeter [2], the ATLAS tracking [7] and trigger [8] systems are briefly discussed. The event selection and signal reconstruction algorithms are discussed in Section 3. The systematic uncertainties of the measurements were reduced by comparing the experimental results to the simulated ones. The simulation program makes use of the Geant4 toolkit [9], [10]. The following experimental results are included: a) uniformity of the response of the cells of a layer, b) layer inter-calibration c) stability of the response over three years and d) \(EM\) scale measurement, are reported in Section 4. The systematic uncertainties of the measurements, including by the ones due to the TileCal calibration procedure are also discussed. Summary and conclusions follow in Section 5.

## 2 The experimental set-up

The ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [11] covers almost the whole solid angle around the collision point with tracking detectors, calorimeters and muon chambers. It was designed to study a wide range of physics topics at LHC energies. For this analysis of cosmic-ray muons the tracking devices [7] and the trigger system [8] were particularly relevant.

### The Tile calorimeter

TileCal [2] is a sampling plastic-scintillator/steel calorimeter, covering the region \(|\eta|\leq 1.7\)1. It is divided into three cylindrical sections, referred to as the Long Barrel (LB) and Extended Barrels (EB).

Figure 2: Long Barrel (LB) (left) and Extended Barrel (EB) (right) sections of the calorimeter. Horizontal dashed lines delineate the 11 rows of scintillating tiles. Full horizontal lines define the three radial layers. Full vertical lines show the cell boundaries. They are formed by grouping optical fibres facing the scintillating tiles to different PMTâ€™s. Also shown are lines of fixed pseudorapidity.

Radially, the TileCal extends from an inner radius of 2.28 m to an outer radius of 4.25 m. Each of the three sections is composed of 64 azimuthal segments, referred to as modules, subtending \(\Delta\phi=2\pi/64\approx 0.0982\). The cylinder axis is parallel to the colliding beams direction and coincides with the \(z\) axis of a right-handed reference system centered on the detector. The \(y\) axis is vertical and points up. The azimuthal angle of the modules \(\phi\) in the region \(y>0\) (\(y<0\)) goes from 0 to \(\pi\) (0 to \(-\pi\)). A schematic drawing of a module is given in Fig. 1. The TileCal plates, made of iron and scintillating material, are placed perpendicular to the colliding beam axis and are radially staggered in depth. The structure is periodic along the \(z\) axis. The scintillating tiles are 3 mm thick and the total thickness of the iron plates in one 18 mm period is 14 mm. Two sides of the scintillating tiles are read out by wave-length shifting (WLS) fibres into two separate PMTs. By the grouping of WLS fibres to specific PMTs, the modules are segmented in \(z\) and in radial depth. In the direction perpendicular to the beam axis the first of the three radial long barrel segments, LB-A, spans 1.5 interaction lengths (\(\lambda_{int}\)), the second, LB-BC, 4.1 \(\lambda_{int}\) and the third, LB-D, 1.8 \(\lambda_{int}\). In the extended barrel the first radial segment from the center, EB-A, has a radial dimension of 1.5 \(\lambda_{int}\), the second, EB-B, 2.6 \(\lambda_{int}\) and the third one, EB-D, 3.3 \(\lambda_{int}\). In the following sections the segments will be called layers. The resulting typical cell dimensions are approximately \(\Delta\eta_{c}\times\Delta\phi_{c}=0.1\times 0.1\) (\(0.2\times 0.1\) in the last layer). TileCal comprises 5182 readout cells. The layout of cells is shown in Fig. 2. This segmentation defines a quasi-projective tower structure, in which the deviations from perfect projectivity are small compared to the typical angular size of hadronic jets.

### The inner-tracking system

The ATLAS Inner Detector (ID) [7] has full coverage in \(\phi\) and covers the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\). It consists of a silicon pixel detector (Pixel), a silicon microstrip detector (SCT) and a transition radiation tracker (TRT). These detectors span a radial distance from the interaction point of 50.5 to 150 mm, of 299 to 560 mm and of 563 to 1066 mm, respectively, and are immersed in a 2 T axial magnetic field. The ID barrel (end-cap) parts consist of 3 (2\(\times\)3) Pixel layers, 4 (2\(\times\)9) double-layers of single-sided silicon microstrips with a 40 mrad stereo angle, and 73 (2\(\times\)160) layers of TRT straws. These detectors have position resolutions of typically 10, 17 and 130 \(\mu\)m for the \(R\)-\(\phi\) co-ordinate and, in case of the Pixel and SCT, 115 and 580 \(\mu\)m for the second measured coordinate.

### The trigger system

The ATLAS detector has a three-level trigger system: Level 1 (L1), Level 2 (L2) and Event Filter (EF) [8]. For the measurements discussed in this paper, the trigger relies on the L1 signals from the Resistive Plate Chambers (RPC) and the Thin Gap Chambers (TGC) of the muon spectrometer [12]. At least one track reconstructed in the SCT volume was required at the EF. Both the solenoid and the toroid magnetic field [13] were on.

## 3 The analysis of the data

About one million events were analyzed in each data period (2008, 2009 and 2010). The muon track reconstructed using the SCT and Pixel is extrapolated through the volume of the calorimeter using the method described in Ref. [14], which provides numerical transportation of the track parameters and their covariance matrix taking into account the material and the magnetic field. The extrapolation is performed following both directions, along and opposite to the reconstructed muon momentum. This also allows for the study of the response of the modules in the top part of the detector though with a worse precision precision because the tracks were reconstructed using the ID measurements. The extrapolation provides crossing points of the muon track on each cylinder, which correspond to the calorimeter layer. Additionallinear interpolation, using the detailed cell geometry model, determines the entry and exit points of the muon in every crossed cell. The track path length \(dl\) is then evaluated as the distance between these points for every cell. The deposited energy \(dE\) in a single cell was determined using the Optimal Filtering Coefficients Method [5]. The \(EM\) scale factor (1.050 pC/GeV) was determined at test beams using electron beams directed on the center of each cell with an angle of 20\({}^{\circ}\). The estimated error on the mean value of this factor is 0.5% [4]. It was transferred to ATLAS by means of the \({}^{137}\)Cs source calibration procedure. Corrections due to the magnetic field effect and to the increase or "up-drift" of the PMTs response to a radioactive \({}^{137}\)Cs source, up to about 1% in average in one year, were applied [5].

### Selection criteria

The following criteria were used to select events for analysis:

**a)**: Only one reconstructed track in the event.
**b)**: The quality of the track is enhanced by requiring at least eight hits in the silicon detectors (Pixel and SCT).
**c)**: A cut in the minimum distance of the reconstructed track from the origin of the coordinates system was used to select a well-reconstructed track that follow the projective geometry of the calorimeter. The cut was applied in the transverse and longitudinal components: \(|d_{0}|\leq 380\) mm and \(|z_{0}|\leq 800\) mm respectively.
**d)**: The reconstructed momentum was in the range \(10<p<30\) GeV. The lower limit was chosen to minimize the effects of multiple scattering. The upper limit reduces the muon radiative energy losses which produce large fluctuations.
**e)**: Signals corresponding to path length \(dl\) shorter then few hundred millimeters are affected by large uncertainties. Therefore only cell signals produced by tracks with \(dl>dl_{min}\) = 200 mm were retained.
**f)**: A reconstruction region was defined in each cell and the muon track was required to be fully-contained to reduce extrapolation errors due to multiple scattering. In fact in a small fraction of the events it was observed that the hit cell is compatible with the pedestal level while a neighbouring cell shows a clear muon signal. The tracks were selected applying the cuts:

\[\begin{split}|\Delta\phi_{inner}|&=|\phi_{c}-\phi _{inner}|<0.04\\ |\Delta\phi_{outer}|&=|\phi_{c}-\phi_{outer}|<0.04 \end{split} \tag{1}\]

where \(\phi_{c}\) is the cell azimuthal angle and \(\phi_{inner}\)(\(\phi_{outer}\)) is the the track impact point azimuthal angle at the inner (outer) surface (\(\Delta\phi_{c}\) = 0.0982 being the cell width).
**g)**: In order to remove residual noise contribution, a cut \(dE>dE_{cut}\) = 60 MeV was applied to the measured cell energy \(dE\).
**h)**: Muons with a trajectory close to the vertical direction are poorly-measured in the TileCal due to the vertical orientation of the scintillating tiles [2]. To ensure more stable results, tracks are required to have a minimum angle \(|\theta|>0.13\). In the smallest cells of layer LB-A this corresponds to a track crossing about three iron/scintillator periods (Subsection 2.1). This cut affects the response only on very central cells, located within the vertical coverage of the ID.
**i)**: Since the cosmic-ray muon momentum was measured using the ID, only cells downstream in the lower part of the calorimeter were used in order to have a better path reconstruction.

### The Monte Carlo simulation

A Monte Carlo simulation study of the cosmic-ray muon events was performed. The MC uses the Geant4 toolkit [9], [10] which provides the physics model(s) of particle interactions with material [15], the ATLAS geometry description and the tracking tools. The MC uses the cosmic-ray muon spectrum as measured at sea level [16]. The material between the ground level and the ATLAS cavern, i.e. the overburden, is simulated including the cavern volumes and access shafts. Air showers are not simulated but should have a negligible effect on the analyses presented here due to the single track requirement. In order to save CPU time, the generated events are pre-filtered before entering the full Geant4 simulation by requiring that the particles cross the ID region. The behavior of the front-end electronics (pulse shaping, electronic noise and digitization) is emulated allowing the energy reconstruction procedure to be applied to the simulated events as well.

Two million MC cosmic-ray muon events were produced, about twice the event statistics in each data period. The selection criteria described in Subsection 3.1 were also applied to the simulated data. In Fig. 3 (Fig. 4) the ratios of the average muon momenta \(p\) (paths \(dl\)) in the first calorimeter layer cells obtained from experimental and simulated data are shown as a function of the cell pseudorapidity, \(\eta_{c}\), and the azimuthal angle, \(\phi_{c}\). On average, the simulation and the experimental data are consistent within a few percent.

### The calorimeter response

Figure 5 shows the profiles of the energy deposition, \(dE\), in the second layer cells obtained using the 2008 data as a function of the track impact point azimuthal coordinate, \(\phi_{inner}\). The tracks were selected by applying the selection criteria described in the Subsection 3.1, except for requirement f). The profiles were obtained by averaging the measured values over tracks along \(\eta\) directions in the central Barrel region. The responses corresponding to cells of individual modules are shown with symbols of different

Figure 3: Ratios of the average momenta \(p\) obtained using experimental and simulated data as a function of a) the pseudorapidity \(\eta_{c}\) and b) the azimuthal angle \(\phi_{c}\) [rad] of the cells of the barrel layer LB-A and the extended barrel layer EB-A. Results obtained in the three data periods are shown. The lack of data around \(|\eta|\approx\)1 and at \(\phi\approx\) 0 1s due to the transition gaps between LB and EB modules and the very low flux of horizontal cosmic-ray muons, respectively.

colors/styles. The match with the nominal position of the cell edges, displayed by vertical lines, is evident. The total response summed over all modules is superimposed as well (black full circles) and it is reasonably uniform across \(\phi\). The alignment between the ID and TileCal was investigated using tracks with a limited transverse impact parameter (\(|d_{0}|\leq 100\) mm). The alignment between tracks and the nominal cell edges is within \(\approx 5\) mm [5]. Similar results were obtained for the other data periods.

The response of cells in the LB-BC layer is shown in Fig. 6 as a function of the track path length \(dl\). The tracks were selected by applying the selection criteria described in Subsection 3.1 except for requirement e). The scatter plot includes selected cosmic-ray muon events crossing the BC cells. An edge at the path length of 840 mm is visible in the figure. This represents the radial depth \(\Delta R\) of the BC layer cells. Since most cosmic-ray muons are vertical, a large fraction of muons crossing the central region have a reconstructed path length equal or slightly larger than the layer radius. A fit to the corresponding profile histogram shows that the muon response scales linearly with the path length to a good approximation. This result suggests that the ratio \(dE/dl\) is a suitable quantity to study the calorimeter inter-calibration. The experimental and the simulated distributions of this quantity for cells LB-A3 and LB-D2 (see Fig. 2) are shown in Fig. 7. The results are obtained using 2008 data. Shifts between distributions are a measurement of cell miscalibration.

The curves shown in Fig. 7 are fits of Landau functions, convoluted with Gaussians, to the data. Despite the qualitative agreement the fits show some instabilities and give very low \(\chi^{2}\) probabilities. This indicates that this analytical form does not describe the distributions over the whole range and thus may yield to biases in evaluating parameters such as the peak value. For this reason a truncated mean, \(\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}\), was used to define the muon response. For each TileCal cell it was computed by truncating a fraction (\(F=\)1%) of entries in the upper side of the \(dE/dl\) distributions. The truncated mean was preferred to the full one because it is less affected by rare energy-loss processes, such as bremsstrahlung or energetic \(\delta\)-rays, that can cause large fluctuations on the mean. It is noteworthy that the truncated mean exhibits a slight non-linear scaling with the path length \(dl\).

Figure 4: Ratios of the average paths \(dl\) obtained using experimental and simulated data as a function of a) the pseudorapidity \(\eta_{c}\) and b) the azimuthal angle \(\phi_{c}\) [rad] of the cells of the barrel layer LB-A and the extended barrel layer EB-A. Results obtained in the three data periods are shown. The lack of data around \(|\eta|\approx\)1 and at \(\phi\approx 0\) is due to the transition gaps between LB and EB modules and the very low flux of horizontal cosmic-ray muons, respectively.

This non-linearity and others residual non-uniformities such as differences in momentum and incident angle spectra are, to a large extent, reproduced by the MC, as discussed in Subsection 3.2. To compensate for these effects the ratio between the experimental and simulated truncated means

\[R=\frac{\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}}{\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}^{MC}} \tag{2}\]

was defined for each calorimeter cell. In the following sections the calorimeter response equalization and the \(EM\) scale setting are always investigated using this quantity. The small remaining differences between the momentum and angular spectra in the data compared to the simulation can affect this estimator of the calorimeter response. The behaviour of the ratio in Eq. (2) was studied by varying the dominant parameters in a wide range of kinematical and geometrical regions. The variations observed were included in the systematic uncertainties as discussed in Subsections 4.2 and 4.4. The comparison of experimental and simulated data can also be biased by a poor simulation of the muon interactions in the calorimeter. This effect was estimated by using different Geant4 physics lists [15] which use different models and different precision to describe various critical processes (e.g. multiple scattering). The effects on the layer inter-calibration were found to be negligible. The effects on the \(EM\) scale determination and resulting systematic uncertainties are discussed in Subsection 4.4. The simulation implements a precise description of the ATLAS geometry. The description of the material budget and volume dimensions in the MC has been validated in the past years with great care [2]. As shown in Fig. 7 the experimental \(dE/dl\) distributions are broader than in the simulation. The effects on the determinations of the ratios (2) are discussed in Subsection 4.2.

The average response over all central region cells in each module is shown by symbols of different colors/styles, whereas the total response summed over all modules is shown with black full circles. The vertical lines denote the nominal edges of the modules. Similar results were obtained using 2009 and 2010 data.

## 4 Results

The experimental results: a) uniformity of the response of the cells of a layer, b) layer inter-calibration, c) stability of the response in three data periods and d) \(EM\) scale measurement, are discussed in this sec

The excess of events around the track path length of 840 mm (radial size of the LB-BC cells) is due to the fact that many cosmic-ray muons are close to the vertical axis. Similar results were obtained using 2009 and 2010 data.

### Uniformity of the calorimeter cell response

As described in the introduction, the inter-calibration of the cell light yield was obtained by passing a \({}^{137}\)Cs source through each scintillators tile. The reproducibility of the equalization is within a few per mille [5]. The gamma rays from the source illuminate a limited region in the scintillator, so the cell

Results obtained for the cells a) LB-A, b) LB-BC and c) LB-D of the module with azimuth angle \(\phi_{c}\) = -1.42 are shown. The horizontal lines correspond to maximum likelihood mean value determinations \(\hat{R}_{c}^{l}\) (\(l\)=1, 2 and 3) discussed in the text. Similar results were obtained analyzing the other layers in 2009 and 2010 data.

equalization with the \({}^{137}\)Cs source can be affected by a non-uniformity in the optical properties of the scintillators. The cosmic-ray muons probe the cells more uniformly over the entire volume and can give a response more representative of the average cell light yield.

The inter-calibration of the cells in each layer was tested by comparing the corresponding experimental and simulated \(dE/dl\) distributions. The ratios of the truncated means, \(R_{c}^{l}=(\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}/\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}^{MC})_{c}^{l}\), were computed for a large number of cells \(c\). Furthermore, the upper region of the detector was included in the analysis.

Figure 9: Ratios of the truncated means of the distributions of the energy deposited in the layer cells by cosmic-ray muons per unit of path length dE/dl, \(R_{c}^{l}\), obtained using 2008 experimental and simulated data as a function of the azimuthal angle \(\phi_{c}\). Results obtained for the cells a) LB-A, b) LB-BC and c) LB-D of the module with pseudorapidity \(\eta_{c}\) = 0.35 are shown. The horizontal lines correspond to maximum likelihood mean value determinations \(\delta_{c}^{l}\) (\(l\)=1, 2 and 3) discussed in the text. The cosmic-ray muon intensity around \(\phi_{c}\) = 0 is very small. Similar results were obtained by analyzing the other layers in 2009 and 2010 data.

by releasing the cut \(i\)) discussed in Subsection 3.1. The index \(l\) runs over the three layers of the barrel, LB-A (\(l=1\)), LB-BC (\(l=2\)), LB-D (\(l=3\)), and the extended barrel EB-A (\(l=4\)), EB-B (\(l=5\)) and EB-D (\(l=6\)). Cells crossed by more than 100 cosmic-ray muon tracks were used. For each data set period only the layers with a total number of cells that satisfy these conditions, \(N_{c}^{l}\), larger than 20 were retained. The \(N_{c}^{l}\) values range between \(\approx 30\) (5% of the layer cells) for EB-B and \(\approx 550\) (45% of the layer cells) for LB-BC.

Figure 8 shows the 2008 ratio \(R_{c}^{l}=(\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}/\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}^{MC})_{c}^{l}\) as a function of cell pseudorapidity \(\eta_{c}\) of the layers a) LB-A, b) LB-BC and c) LB-D belonging to the module at the azimuthal angle \(\phi=-1.42\) (see Subsection 2.1). Similarly, the ratios obtained for the cells of the layers a) LB-A, b) LB-BC and c) LB-D at fixed \(\eta_{c}=0.3\) are shown in Fig. 9 as a function of the cell azimuthal angle \(\phi_{c}\). The \(R_{c}^{l}\) values are quite constant moving across the detector \(\eta_{c}\) and \(\phi_{c}\) values. Some differences in the average response of the different layers are visible and will be discussed in the next section. The dispersion of the cells around the average is a measure of a possible non-uniformity of the cell response not described in the MC.

The hypothesis that the cells of each layer \(l\) are inter-calibrated was tested using as a statistic the minimum of the \(\chi^{2}\) function [6]:

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{c}^{N_{c}^{l}}\frac{(R_{c}^{l}-\mu^{l})^{2}}{(\sigma_{c}^{l})^ {2}}. \tag{3}\]

The parameters \(\mu^{l}\) were determined in the minimization. The relevant statistical errors

\[\sigma_{c}^{l2}=R_{c}^{l2}[(\frac{(\sigma(dE/dl)_{r})_{c}^{l}}{\sqrt{N_{c}^{l} }(\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t})_{c}^{l}})^{2}+(\frac{(\sigma(dE/dl)_{r}^{MC})_{c}^{ l}}{\sqrt{N_{c}^{l}\,{}^{MC}}(\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}^{MC})_{c}^{l}})^{2}] \tag{4}\]

are obtained using the RMS of the experimental and simulated truncated distributions, \((\sigma(dE/dl)_{r})_{c}^{l}\) and \((\sigma(dE/dl)_{r}^{MC})_{c}^{l}\), respectively. The quantities \(N_{c}^{l\,{}^{MC}}\) are the number of tracks in a cell \(c\) in the case of simulated data. Apart from the layer EB-B, the \(p\)-values obtained by minimizing Eq. (3) are very small (\(<10^{-5}\)) indicating that the cells fluctuate more than expected by statistical uncertainties. The data, as discussed at the beginning of this section, do not show a clear structure. The deviations of particular cells from the average is consistent in the three periods analyzed, suggesting that this extra dispersion is not random. The same behaviour has been observed in a separate data-driven analysis, indicating that the effect is not due to the MC simulation.

This additional non-uniformity of the cells in a layer, \(s^{l}\), was determined by applying the Maximum Likelihood method described in the following section. Assuming that the quantities \(R_{c}^{l}\) follow a Gaussian distribution, the function

\[L=\prod_{c=1}^{N_{c}^{l}}\frac{1}{\sqrt{(\sigma_{c}^{l2}+s^{l2})2\pi}}e^{- \frac{1}{2}(\frac{\mu_{c}^{l}-\mu^{l}}{\sqrt{\sigma_{c}^{l2}+s^{l2}}})^{2}} \tag{5}\]

where \(\sigma_{c}^{l}\) is defined in Eq. (4) was maximized. The estimations of the mean value of the Gaussian distributions \(\mu^{l}\), \(\hat{R}_{c}^{l}\), and of \(s^{l}\), \(\hat{s}^{l}\), are reported in Table 1. The layer EB-B shows values of \(s^{l}\) consistent with 0, compatible with the results of the \(\chi^{2}\) test of Eq. (3). The horizontal lines shown in Figs. 8 and 9 correspond to the \(\hat{R}_{c}^{l}\) values.

The distributions of \((R_{c}^{l}-\hat{R}_{c}^{l})/(\sqrt{\sigma_{c}^{l2}+\hat{s}^{l2}})\) are compatible with Gaussians with mean values and sigma's equal to 0 and 1, respectively, proving the goodness of the method. The results of the layer LB-BC in the case of the 2010 cosmic-ray muon data are reported in Fig. 10.

The additional term \(s^{l}\) is produced by a combination of different factors, such as systematic errors due to limitations of the simulation and spreads in cell inter-calibration. In particular the MC simulation has no variations in the quality of the optical components of the calorimeter or in the channel signal shape. The resulting values of \(s^{l}\) are then interpreted as upper limits on the average non-uniformity of the cells of a layer. It is worthwhile to recall that a similar degree of non-uniformity was obtained by studying the calorimeter response to electron test beams [4].

### Inter-calibration of the radial layers

In this section the measurement of the layer inter-calibration is presented. In order to have a more reliable determination all the selection criteria discussed in Subsection 3.1 were applied. The \(dE/dl\) distributions were determined for all the cells of a layer. The results obtained using simulated and 2008 experimental data are shown in Fig. 11. They are normalized for comparison.

Only the layers with a number of cells crossed by more than 100 cosmic-ray muons tracks larger than 20 were retained in the analysis.

A Gaussian function fit to the data (red curve) has the mean value and the sigma equal to -0.085\(\pm\)0.050 and 1.064\(\pm\) 0.046 respectively. The \(\chi^{2}\) probability of the fit is 69%.

uncertainties are reported. For each period, the number of tracks per the cell measured in each layer range from 7k (EB) to 100k (LB). The ratio values \(R^{l}=(\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}/\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}^{MC})^{l}\) reported in Table 3 are in agreement with the results of Subsection 4.1. The largest difference between the response of two layers is 4%. The LB measurements are in agreement with those obtained at the test beams using projective muons [5].

Systematic effects have been investigated to establish the significance of the observed differences in response. In the analysis, correlation effects have been taken into account. As summarized in Table 4, ten sources of systematic uncertainties were considered. The sources 1-6 are related to the selection criteria described in Subsection 3.1. To be conservative, the differences between the response produced by cosmic-ray muons in the cells of the lower part of the detector (\(\phi_{c}<0\)), after the muon momentum measurement, and in the upper part of the detector (\(\phi_{c}>0\)), before the muon momentum is measured were considered as source 6. The uncertainties of the method applied to determine the detector response to cosmic-ray muons (Subsection 3.3) are determined considering the sources 7 and 8. The effect of the different spread of the experimental and simulated \(dE/dl\) distributions on the determination of the truncated means discussed in Subsection 3.3 was estimated to be equal to 0.3% using a toy MC. The third class of uncertainties, 9 and 10, concerns the signal calibration procedures performed at the test

beam and in-situ at ATLAS. The uncertainty on the calibration radial correction (Source 9) measured in test beams using \(90^{\circ}\) muons [4] was estimated to be 0.3%. The cell read-out up-drift and magnetic field effect determinations (Source 10), discussed in Section 3, were assigned a systematic correlated uncertainty equal to 1% and 0.6% in the LB and EB cells, respectively. The responses were also compared for various triggers whose efficiencies depend on the muon momentum and also the event topology. The data triggered by the TGC and RPC indicate a good match within uncertainties; therefore the associated systematic uncertainty is considered to be negligible with respect to other contributions reported in Table 4.

Systematic parameters, \(S_{m}\), were considered as random variables [17] and their values were selected according to the distributions reported in Table 4. In the case of the sources 3, 8 and 9 the errors are uncorrelated and a different value of \(S_{m}\) was used for each layer. Each combination of the parameters was used to generat a pseudo-measurement \(R^{\prime l}\) (\(l=1,...,6\)). The distributions obtained using 2010 data for the layers LB-A, LB-BC and LB-D are reported in Fig. 12. The curves correspond to Gaussian functions fit to the data. The error matrix \(V\) was determined using the equation

\[V^{l,r}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}(R^{\prime l}-\hat{R^{\prime}}^{l})(R^{\prime r^{ \prime}}-\hat{R^{\prime l}}^{r})}{N}\, \tag{6}\]

where \(N\), equal to 2500, is the number of pseudo-measurements and \(\hat{R^{\prime}}^{l}\) the averages of the distributions. The 2008 results are reported in Table 5. Similar results were found for the 2009 and 2010 error matrix values. The contribution of the statistical errors reported in Table 2 is negligible. The measurement uncertainties of Table 3 correspond to the square root of the diagonal error matrix elements. The absolute values of the corresponding correlation matrix elements

In the following the results of the method used to establish the uniformity of the layer response are discussed. A model with six parameters, \(\mu^{l}\) (\(l\)=1,..., 6), corresponding to the mean values of a six dimensional Gaussian function (see Eq. (10)) was considered. According to the Bayes theorem the parameter values can be inferred from the \(R^{l}\) measurements reported in Table 3 using the equation

Figure 12: Distributions of the pseudo-measurement ratios of the experimental and simulated truncated means of the energy deposited in the layer cells by cosmic-ray muons per unit of path length. The pseudo-measurements were obtained by changing the criteria applied to select and reconstruct the events. The 2010 results of the Barrel layers LB-A, LB-BC and LB-D are shown. The curves correspond to Gaussian functions fit to the data.

\[f(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6}\mid R^{1},...,R^{6})=\frac{f(R^{1},...,R^{6}\mid\mu^{1},..., \mu^{6})f_{0}(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6})}{\int f(R^{1},...,R^{6}\mid\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6} )f_{0}(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6})d\mu^{1}....\;d\mu^{6}} \tag{8}\]

where the probability function (PDF) of the measurements, for given values of \(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6}\), \(f(R^{1},...,R^{6}\mid\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6})\), is equal to the likelihood function \(\mathcal{L}(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6};R^{1},...,R^{6})\). Due to a "vague" prior knowledge of the parameters, flat prior probabilities \(f_{0}(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6})\)[17] were used and the equation

\[f(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6}\mid R^{1},...,R^{6})\propto f(R^{1},...,R^{6}\mid\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6})\propto\mathcal{L}(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6};R^{1},...,R^{6}) \tag{9}\]

was obtained. Since the \(R^{l}\) distributions are near Gaussian (see Fig. 12), the six layer measurements, \(R^{1},...,R^{6}\) were assumed to be representative of a six-dimension Gaussian function:

\[f(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6}\mid R^{1},...,R^{6})=K\mathcal{L}(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6};R ^{1},...,R^{6})=K^{\prime}e^{[-\frac{1}{2}(\vec{R}-\vec{F})^{T}V^{-1}(\vec{R} -\vec{F})]} \tag{10}\]

where \(K\) and \(K^{\prime}\) are normalization factors, \(\vec{R}=(R^{1},...,R^{6})\) and \(\vec{F}=(\mu^{1},...,\mu^{6})\). The vectors \(\vec{R}\) and \(\vec{F}\) are column vectors. The superscript \(T\) denotes a row vector. The quantity \(V^{-1}\) is the inverse of the error matrix (see Eq. 6).

For each pair of layers, \(l\) and \(l^{\prime}\), the posterior PDF \(f(\mu^{l},\mu^{l^{\prime}}\mid R^{1},...,R^{6})\) was computed integrating numerically Eq. (10) over the other layer parameters. The posterior PDF \(f(\mu^{1},\mu^{3}\mid R^{1},...,R^{6})\) obtained using 2010 data is shown in Fig. 13. As shown in Fig. 14, the PDF of the 2010 data ratios \(\mu^{l}/\mu^{l^{\prime}}\) are well described by Gaussian functions. The mean values and the RMS of the distributions are reported in

### Stability of the layer response

The TileCal response could evolve with time due to: a) PMT response drift, b) aging effects of the scintillator and WLS fibres due to their organic material whose light yield can change with time and c) damage effects due to radiation or mechanical changes in the coupling of the optical components due to stress, vibrations and movements necessary for maintenance operations. As already mentioned, a decrease of the response of the detector of about 1% per year was monitored using the laser and \({}^{137}\)Cs systems. The cosmic-ray muon data allowed for the validation of the adjustments performed in the period 2008-2010.

The results discussed in Subsections 4.1 and 4.2 show that the TileCal response is quite stable over the three years studied. The method described in Subsection 4.2 was used to quantify the stability of the layer response, \(R^{l}\), as a function of time. For each layer \(l\) the measurements \(R^{l}_{y}\) obtained in the three years \(y\)=2008, \(y\)=2009, and \(y\)=2010 were compared. The posterior distribution used was

\[f(\mu^{l}_{2008},\mu^{l}_{2009},\mu^{l}_{2010}\mid R^{l}_{2008},R^{l}_{2009},R^{ l}_{2010})=Ke^{[-\frac{1}{2}(\vec{p}-\vec{G})^{T}W^{-1}(\vec{p}-\vec{G})]} \tag{11}\]

where \(K\) is a normalization factor and \(\vec{P}=(R^{l}_{2008},R^{l}_{2009},R^{l}_{2010})\). The quantity \(\vec{G}=(\mu^{l}_{2008},\mu^{l}_{2009},\mu^{l}_{2010})\) is the vector of the model parameters corresponding to the components of the mean value of a three dimensional Gaussian function. The error matrix \(W\) describes the uncertainties and the correlations of the measurements performed in the different years. This was obtained by analyzing the effect of the selection criteria as described in Subsection 4.2. The elements of \(W\) obtained by comparing the 2008 and 2010 results of the layer LB-A are reported in Table 7. The distributions of the ratios \(\mu^{l}_{y}/\mu^{l}_{y^{\prime}}\) were determined by integrating numerically Eq. (11) over the other \(\mu^{l}\) variables. The mean values of the distributions are reported in Table 8. The errors correspond to the RMS of the distributions. The determinations are consistent with unity and the maximum deviation observed is at the 2 sigma level. The uncertainties of the LB comparisons are close to the PMT's average up-drift measured with \({}^{137}\)Cs in one year (see Section 3). One can conclude then that, within the present uncertainties, the response of the calorimeter to cosmic-ray muons was stable over the three years studied.

### The Electromagnetic energy scale test

In this section the results of a check of the current \(EM\) energy scale value in ATLAS are presented. Since the cosmic-ray muon data show layer miscalibration (see Subsection 4.2) the study was performed independently for each layer. As discussed in the Introduction, the energy scale of TileCal was determined using beams of electrons at test beams and transported to ATLAS using measurements performed with a \({}^{137}\)Cs source. The scale was defined in an analogous way in the MC simulation. The response of electrons was simulated in a setup similar to the test beam one and the incident particle energy was used to define the MC conversion factor. The ratio between the data and the simulated response to muons, Eq. (2), is expected to be equal to 1 and any deviation is attributed to a difference between the current scale in ATLAS, \(EM_{ATLAS}\), and the one set at test beams, \(EM\)

\[R^{l}=R^{l}_{EM}=\frac{EM^{l}_{ATLAS}}{EM}. \tag{12}\]

To identify the possible sources of systematic errors, the \(R^{l}\) ratios can be expressed by making more explicit all the factors which affect the scale setting:

\[R^{l}_{EM}=(\frac{\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}}{\langle dE/dl\rangle_{t}^{MC}})^{l }=(\frac{\langle dE_{pC}/dl\rangle_{t}}{\langle dE_{dep}/dl\rangle_{t}^{MC}}) ^{l}\times\frac{E^{eMC}_{dep}}{E^{eMC}}\times\frac{f_{instr}}{f_{instr}^{e}} \times\frac{E^{eTB}}{E^{eTB}_{pC}} \tag{13}\]

where \(dE_{pC}\) is the signal in pC produced in a cell by cosmic-ray muons, \(E^{eTB}_{pC}\) is the signal measured in pC produced by electrons with energy \(E^{eTB}\) in the range 20 to 180 GeV impinging on the cells at 20\({}^{\circ}\), \(dE_{dep}\) is the simulated energy deposited in the active material of a cell by cosmic-ray muons, \(E^{eMC}_{dep}\) is the simulated energy deposited by electrons with energy \(E^{eMC}\) in the range 20 to 180 GeV impinging on the cells at 20\({}^{\circ}\) and \(EM=E^{eTB}_{pC}/E^{eTB}\). The signals measured in pC take into account the inter-calibration of the electronics read-out with the CIS system and of the cell light yield and PMT gain equalization obtained with the \({}^{137}\)Cs source. The ratio \(R_{instr}\)=\(f_{instr}/f_{instr}^{e}\) describes the differences of the response of the detector to cosmic-ray muons and calibration electrons.

The systematic uncertainties considered are:

* The uncertainiy on the cosmic-ray muons analysis, \(\Delta_{cosm}\), affecting for each module \(l\) the ratio between \(\langle dE_{pC}/dl\rangle_{t}\) and \(\langle dE_{dep}/dl\rangle_{t}^{MC}\) in Eq. (13). It has been already discussed in Subsection 4.2 and the results are summarized in Table 9. For completeness the determinations of \(R^{l}_{EM}\) are also reported in the table
* The uncertainty on the determination of the \(EM\) scale at the TBs, \(\Delta_{cal}\), and its transportation to ATLAS affecting the ratio \(\langle dE_{pC}/dl\rangle_{t}/E^{eTB}_{pC}\) of Eq. (13)
* The uncertainty on the simulation of the muon and electron calorimeter response, \(\Delta_{MC}\), affecting the ratios \(R_{dep}\)=\(E^{eMC}_{dep}/(\langle dE_{dep}/dl\rangle_{t}^{MC})^{l}\) and \(R_{instr}\)=\(f_{instr}/f_{instr}^{e}\) of Eq. (13).

The errors \(\Delta_{cal}\) and \(\Delta_{MC}\) affect all the determinations of \(R^{l}\) in a correlated way and were not considered in the inter-calibration studies reported in Subsection 4.2. The uncertainty \(\Delta_{cal}\), reported in Table 9, was obtained by combining in quadrature the uncertainties on:

**i.**: The \(EM\) scale determined at the test beam due to the precision on the knowledge of the absolute beam momentum (0.5%) [4];
**ii.**: The propagation of the calibration of the \({}^{137}\)Cs readout gain from the test beam to ATLAS (0.2%) [5]

**iii.**: The propagation of the calibration of the digital readout by CIS affected by an uncertainty of 0.1% [5].

The simulation of the muons and electrons transport in TileCal was done with the default ATLAS simulation program [9], [10], based on the Geant4 QGSP_BERT physics list [15]. The systematic errors associated to the use of this specific transportation code can be determined using special simulations of muons and electrons in which different parameters or models are used.

**iv.**: The most important source of systematic uncertainty in the simulation is the use of cuts on the energy of particles described in detail in Subsection 7.4 of Ref. [15]. These cuts are applied to gamma-rays and electrons associated with energetic \(\delta\)-rays and bremsstrahlung. If the secondary electron and gamma are below a defined threshold the secondary is not tracked and its kinetic energy is treated as a local energy deposit. It should be noted that production cuts are expressed in terms of particle range and converted internally by Geant4 into energy cuts. In addition, unlike Geant3, when a secondary is produced it is always tracked down to zero kinetic energy. The cut value has

Table 9: Ratio \(R^{l}_{EM}=EM^{l}_{ATLAS}/EM\) between the actual value of the energy scale in the calorimeter layers of ATLAS and the value obtained at test beams. The differences between the values of the layer energy scale obtained in the analysis and the one set at test beams using electrons range between -3% and +1%. The uncertainty in the third column is the square root of the diagonal elements of the error matrix (see Eq. (6)) describing the uncertainties on the cosmic-ray muons analysis. The values in the fourth column are additional experimental uncertainties on the determination of the \(EM\) scale at test beams and its transportation to ATLAS. The uncertainty on the simulation of the TileCal response to muons is reported in the fifth column. The total error obtained by combining in quadrature the three effects is reported in the last column. It is equal to about 2%.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:23]

The instrumental effects \(f_{instr}\) (\(f^{e}_{instr}\)) considered in the case of muons (electrons) in Eq. (13) are:

**vii.**: Saturation effects described by the Birks law [19] reducing the output light of the scintillators. Since the Birks coefficients have not been measured for the TileCal scintillators, the attenuation of the light is implemented in the detector read-out simulation using the coefficients for the NE-102 scintillator as described in [20]. The systematic uncertainty associated with this effect was studied by making a special simulation in which the beam energy was set to 20 GeV. The difference of the values of \(R_{instr}\) obtained with and without Birks effect was used to estimate the systematic associated to its implementation in the simulation. The value is \(\pm\)0.6%.
**viii**: The PMT photo-statistics effect is the same for muons and electrons and cancels in the ratio \(R_{instr}\).
**ix**: The light attenuation in the fibres is the same for muon and electron signals. The effects of the light attenuation in the scintillating tile were estimated in the data by changing the values of the cuts (f), discussed in Subsection 3.1, applied on the azimuthal angle to ensure containement of the track in the cell under consideration (see Subsection 4.2).

The uncertainties **iv-ix** have been combined in quadrature to obtain the error \(\Delta_{MC}\) reported in Table 9. Since the uncertainties \(\Delta_{cal}\) and \(\Delta_{MC}\) of each measurement are correlated, the error matrices were obtained for each year by adding the quantity \(\sqrt{\Delta_{cal}^{2}+\Delta_{MC}^{2}}=0.00019\) to each value \(V^{l,l^{\prime}}\) obtained using Eq. (6). The 2010 data results are reported in Table 10. The total errors \(\Delta_{tot}\) in Table 9 correspond to the square root of the diagonal error matrix elements.

## 5 Summary and conclusions

Cosmic-ray muon events collected in 2008, 2009 and 2010 have been used in the ATLAS experiment to test the calibration of the hadronic barrel calorimeter TileCal. The results concerning: a) uniformity of the calorimeter cell response, b) layer inter-calibration, c) stability of the response in the three years and d) \(EM\) scale measurement are reported here.

The analysis was based on the comparison between experimental and simulated data. The means of relevant simulated distributions such as the cosmic-ray muon momentum and the cell path length agree with the experimental ones within a few percent.

Upper limits on the average non-uniformity of the response of the cells in a layer were estimated to be \(\pm\)2%. In the study of the layer inter-calibration the systematic error due to the cosmic-ray muon measurements and to the TileCal calibration procedure were considered. A maximal deviation of 4% was observed. A Bayesian statistical method shows that the layer LB-D response differs from that of LB-A and LB-BC by about 4 and 3 standard deviations, respectively. The responses of all the other layer

pairs are consistent. The differences between the values of the layer energy scale obtained in this analysis and the one set at test beams using electrons range between -3% and +1%. The sources of uncertainty in the response measurements are strongly correlated, and include the uncertainty in the simulation of the muon response. The total error of each layer determination represented by the value of the diagonal elements of the error matrix is equal to 2%.

Stable results were obtained for the three periods. They show that the \({}^{137}\)Cs system is able to follow the variations of the PMTs gain and to compensate for the drift of the response at a level better than 1% and 3% in the LB and EB respectively.
