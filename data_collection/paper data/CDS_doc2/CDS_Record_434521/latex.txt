###### Abstract

We report on the development of evaporative fluorocarbon cooling for the ATLAS Pixel and Semiconductor Tracker (SCT) detectors. Data are presented from cooling studies on representative prototype Pixel and SCT detector thermo-structures, using perfluoro-n-propane (C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\)), -butane (C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\)), trifluoro-iodo-methane (CF\({}_{3}\)I) and custom C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\)/C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) mixtures. Thermophysical properties were calculated for custom mixtures.

For most of the structures tested at full projected power dissipation, operation of silicon detector substrates at temperatures below -7\({}^{o}\)C (required for 10 year lifetime in the radiation environment of LHC) should be possible, albeit in some cases with increases in inner diameter (I.D.) of the coolant tubes from those of the present series of prototypes.

Heat transfer coefficients in the range 2-5.10\({}^{3}\) Wm-2K-1 have been measured in a 3.6 mm I.D. heated tube dissipating 100 Watts - close to the full equivalent power (~110 W) of a barrel SCT detector "stave" - over a range of power dissipations and mass flows in the above fluids.

Aspects of full-scale evaporative cooling circulator design for the ATLAS experiment are discussed, together with plans for future development.

## 1 Introduction

The SCT detector [1] will have 4 cylinders around the collision point (_barrel_) and 9 forward disks at each end. Each cylinder consists of "staves" containing 12 silicon strip detector modules, while disks contain 132 modules. The total SCT dissipation will be around 41.3kW, with ~9.2W from each module, subdivided into ~2W (after 10 years of irradiation) from the silicon substrate, and ~7W from the readout electronics.

The pixel detector [2] has ten forward disks and three cylinders containing staves of 13 pixel detector modules. The total detector dissipation will be around 18.7 kW, with around 7.9W from each module (11W in the B-physics layer at a radius of ~4.5 cm from the beams).

Our studies [3],[4] have been directed to cooling systems contributing the minimal possible material, particularly important for the pixel B layer. Evaporative fluorocarbon cooling combines high heat transfer coefficients with very low circulating coolant mass (1-2gram.s-1/100W to evacuate). Liquid refrigerant can be delivered to the detector in capillaries with IDs as small as 0.6 mm. Furthermore, fluorocarbon refrigerants are non-flammable, non-toxic insulators with zero ozone depletion potential.

Latent heat data for the various refrigerants are shown in table 1, together with their saturated vapor pressures and the volume of vapor produced per cm\({}^{3}\) liquid evaporated at -15\({}^{o}\)C (a temperature chosen to accommodate probable thermal impedances between the silicon substrate and the coolant). A target evaporation pressure of 1 bar (abs)

## 2 Test Results on SCT and Pixel Prototype Thermo-Structures

### The Refrigerant Recirculator

A closed-loop evaporative recirculator (figure 1) has been built for testing thermo-structures using all the fluids of table 1. Structures are placed in a chamber purged with inert gas and maintained at \(-7^{\circ}\)C, to simulate the environment of the SCT and pixels in the ATLAS inner detector.

The present circulator contains two compressor stages and a water-cooled condenser, also serving as a high-pressure liquid refrigerant reservoir. The first stage compressor1 is used only with low input pressure vapors as in the case of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) or C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\)/C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\), since the pumping speed of the second stage2 compressor is insufficient at input pressures below 1 bar abs. These compressors will soon be replaced with a single stage dry scroll compressor (Atlas Copco SF4-8-120) with a measured flat pumping speed of \(\sim\)20 m\({}^{3}\)hr-1 for both C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) (P\({}_{\rm in}\) = 0.25, P\({}_{\rm out}\) = 4 bar abs) and C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) (P\({}_{\rm in}\) = 1.4, P\({}_{\rm out}\) = 8 bar abs).

(rated 30 m\({}^{3}\)hr-1 air, Pi\({}_{\rm in}\) 1 bar abs, P\({}_{\rm out}\) = 1.5 bar abs limit)

Liquid refrigerant enters a four-channel supply manifold, whose pressure - defined by a regulator - determines the liquid mass flow. Fluid enters the test structures via capillaries with diameters varying between 0.6 and 1 mm, or via injectors made from synthetic ruby watch bearings with orifices varying between 210 and 300 \(\mu\)m.

The temperature of evaporation of fluid in the test structures depends on the pressure in a 4-channel vapor collection manifold tank, controlled via feedback from a pressure sensor3 to a variable orifice valve located between the tank and the compressor input. The circulating mass flow is metered after the tank.

### Tests on a Forward SCT Thermo-Structure

Figure 2 shows a recent model for the on-detector cooling for a quarter disk of the ATLAS forward SCT, in which 18 similar disks will each support 132 silicon strip modules, and dissipate 1.2kW.

On the "front", heat from two arcs of silicon micro-strip modules (simulated with resistive heaters) is conducted to the coolant via attachment blocks glued to the cooling tubes (figure 3). On the "rear" a third arc of modules will provide tacking hermeticity through overlap.

To accommodate thermal expansion effects, each quadrant has two serpentine circuits with 3.6 mm ID tubes, and lengths 2.5 & 3.5m ("A"&"B"), respectively cooling 14 and 19 modules. Each circuit first cools the inner front arc of modules, follows an arc at the outer radius, and then cools the modules on the rear of the panel.

Thermal connections to the cooling tube are of several types: some attachment blocks evacuate the simulated 7W power of the module readout electronics ("E"): those along the front outer arc evacuate only \(\sim\) 2W of substrate ("S") dissipation. The innermost front blocks traverse the support, and evacuate, in addition to the 9W (E+S) dissipation of the front inner modules, \(\sim\)2W from the simulated substrates of the rear modules. Blocks are of

several different heights, and some span a gap between joined tubes, presenting lower impedance for heat conduction into the fluid.

Figure 4 shows the temperature profile along circuit "B" with C4F10 at half-nominal power (3.42W (E); 0.97W (S)). The tube is everywhere below 10\({}^{\circ}\)C: with the exhaust cooler than the input (characteristic for evaporative cooling), in this case by 6\({}^{\circ}\)C. Most blocks lie below the target temperature of -7\({}^{\circ}\)C. The six with double-sided heating are considerably warmer (from -2\({}^{\circ}\)C to -5\({}^{\circ}\)C) than the (S) blocks or those spanning a tube join.

We could not cool the present structure to -7\({}^{\circ}\)C at the full power dissipation with C4F10, due to the large pressure gradient along the 3.6 mm ID tube, generated by the relatively large volume of vapor produced (table 1) at low boiling pressures of around 500 mbar (abs).

For C3F8 the results were significantly better. At full power (7W (E); 2W (S)) and a boiling pressure 2.3 bar a, the temperature of all blocks, with the exception of the rear "S" side of the double block (now being redesigned), were below -6\({}^{\circ}\)C, and the temperature gradient along the tube was only -2\({}^{\circ}\)C. The temperature difference between the blocks and the tube was also less, probably due to a higher heat transfer coefficient for C3F8. By decreasing this boiling pressure, the temperature of the test structure could be further, uniformly, reduced.

### Tests on SCT Barrel Structures

The present cooling circuit manifolding proposed for the SCT barrel is shown in figure 6. Coolant is injected through a capillary to a series pair of staves with a total tube length of 3.2m. A common exhaust is shared with a second series pair of staves mounted in parallel.

In the present thermo-structure, each stave carries 12 heater plates attached with thermally conductive glue to one 7.2mm side of a flat-walled oval tube having an equivalent I.D. of 2.7mm. A total of 64 temperature sensors are attached to the plates and on the tubes between them. Plates are laminated from two (60 x 20 mm) pieces of aluminum with thermally conductive glue, to investigate the layering of the detector module, in which the hybrid supporting the readout electronics ("E") is mounted on top of the silicon substrate ("S"), which has closer attachment to the cooling tube. Temperature sensors are mounted on the E and S sides of the blocks.

Figure 7 shows sample data taken with C3F8 at -9W/block. The temperature (pressure) gradient between the input of the first series stave and the output of the second is -7\({}^{\circ}\)C (1.1 bar). Block temperatures vary between -2\({}^{\circ}\)C and -13\({}^{\circ}\)C, and the target (S) temperature of -7\({}^{\circ}\)C is not met at the beginning of the first stave. The (60 x 7mm) film of thermal glue fastening the blocks to the tube causes an average temperature difference of -7\({}^{\circ}\)C between the tube and the S sides of the blocks. The E sides are -2\({}^{\circ}\)C warmer. It was concluded that the 2.7 mm ID of the cooling tubes in the present thermo-structure was insufficient to evacuate the

vapor produced from \(\sim\)220W dissipation of two staves in series.

Figure 8 is an example of test data with the manifold rebuilt for a "single pass" of refrigerant. The temperature (pressure) profile along the 1.6m state with the 2.7mm ID tube is \(\sim\)2\({}^{\circ}\)C (0.3 bar). Block temperatures (E) vary between -8\({}^{\circ}\)C and -11\({}^{\circ}\)C, and the target (S) temperature of -7\({}^{\circ}\)C was met everywhere along the stave.

Figures 11a & b show the temperature profile along the stave for CF3I and C4F10 for power loads varying between 78W and 143W, for C3F8 at a power of 100W and for a 50/50 (molar) C4F10/C3F8 mixture at 55W. The average silicon temperatures at the different boiling pressures are given in table 2.

It was found that the ID of the present pixel stave tube is insufficient to maintain the -7C silicon temperature with C4F10 at dissipations exceeding \(\sim\)80W, and with the 50/50 C4F10/C3F8 mixture at dissipations exceeding \(\sim\)60W, but that cooling to the target temperature was possible, both with CF3I and C3F8 at the highest envisaged dissipation (figure 11b). The next version of the pixel stave will use a 4.6 mm equivalent ID tube, which should be large enough to allow pairs of pixel staves to be connected in series.

## 3 Measurement of Heat Transfer Coefficient

A second refrigerant recirculator was constructed to allow simultaneous measurements of heat transfer coefficient (HTC) while full size thermo-structure prototypes were measured in the main circulator. Heat transfer coefficients were measured on a 1.6m long simplified SCT wave with 12 copper blocks soft-soldered onto a 1.6 m long cupronickel tube with 3.6mm ID. On each block were a ceramic heater and a PT100 sensor. PT100's were fitted to the coolant tube in 13 positions between the blocks and at each end. Another sensor measured the liquid temperature upstream of the capillary or injector. In this tube, HTCs were measured at 12 points along the tube from the (block-tube) temperature difference, and knowledge of the dissipation at each block and its contact area with the tube. Typical HTC measurements for the different fluids in this tube are shown in figure 12, and varied in the range 2-5.10\({}^{3}\) Wm-2K-1 depending on power dissipation. The highest HTCs were seen in the case of C3F8, and the lowest with 50/50 C4F10/C3F8. Reduced HTCs for mixtures have been reported elsewhere[10].

## 4 Refrigerant Irradiation Study

### Effects of Neutron Irradiation

Small, static liquid samples of perfluor-n-hexane (C6F14), CF3I, solid Teflon and iodine (I2) were irradiated up to 3x10\({}^{13}\) fast neutrons.cm-2 to simulate the expected environment at LHC. Studies showed the main longest-lived radioisotopes to be \({}^{18}\)F (106 min: 511 KeV

Pixel C-C stave: CF3I and C4F10\(\gamma\) emitter) and \({}^{128}\)I (25 min: 433 KeV \(\gamma\) emitter). From neutron capture cross section data, the expected activity levels for these radionuclides are in the range 10\({}^{4}\)-10\({}^{5}\) Bq.g-1 during circulation (for an instantaneous rate \(\sim\) 10\({}^{6}\) n.cm-2s-1), which is believed to be acceptable in a closed circuit system. However, the overall measured level of I\({}_{2}\) activation was measured to be very high.

### Radiation-Induced Chemical Modifications

Small, static liquid samples of C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\) and CF\({}_{3}\)I were exposed to \({}^{60}\)C gamma irradiation. After an absorbed dose of 3 Mrad, about 1% by weight of C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\) liquid had been radio-chemically modified: there was chemical evidence of the production of reactive HF, due to impurities containing C-H groups. Scanning electron microscopy and Auger electron spectroscopy were used to characterize the morphologies and elemental compositions of C, F and O- containing polymeric deposits formed on stainless steel and aluminum samples immersed in liquid during irradiation. After 6Mrad, surfaces were almost uniformly covered to a depth of \(\sim\) 0.4 \(\mu\)m. Degradation and plate-out were greater in a sample of C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\) to which 3% (vol.) n-heptane had been added to act as a H-source.

Since saturated fluorocarbons (C\({}_{n}\)F\({}_{(2n+2)}\)), are synthesized from alkane precursors, batch testing for residual H contamination (using the characteristic Fourier Transform Infra-Red signature of C-H bonds) is advisable. Techniques for the catalytic removal of C\({}_{n}\)F\({}_{x}\)H\({}_{(2n-x)}\) contamination were developed [11] for the DELPHI RICH detector, where high fluid purity is needed for good UV transparency: similar techniques could be used in the present application.

After irradiation to 2Mrad, liquid CF\({}_{3}\)I had become opaque, and breakdown of CF\({}_{3}\)I into I\({}_{2}\) and HI was seen. This was not a complete surprise, since CF\({}_{3}\)I is a refrigerant with a short (\(\sim\)24 hr) atmospheric half-life. Oily residues (pre-polymers) were observed after the evaporation of the irradiated CF\({}_{3}\)I, and thick deposits, including crystalline I\({}_{2}\) were observed on aluminum and stainless steel immersion samples. Although it was possible to clean the CF\({}_{3}\)I to remove I\({}_{2}\) and re-establish the transparency, CF\({}_{3}\)I was finally abandoned as a coolant owing to its chemical aggressivity, even in the un-irradiated state, to elastomer seal materials.

## 5 Conclusion

Evaporative cooling has been demonstrated at the full power dissipation of the ATLAS SCT and pixel detectors. Studies with engineering prototypes and measurements of heat transfer coefficient indicate that C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) is presently the best candidate refrigerant. The low boiling pressure of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) (\(\sim\)350 mbar abs @ \(\sim\) -25\({}^{\circ}\)C) allows a small pressure head to drive vapor back to the compressor input. Of the fluids with "ideal" thermodynamics (saturated vapor pressure \(\sim\) 1 bar (abs) at \(\sim\) -25\({}^{\circ}\)C), C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\)/C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) custom mixtures are less favored due to lower heat transfer coefficient, while CF\({}_{3}\)I has been rejected due to its chemical aggressivity, poor chemical stability under ionizing radiation, and radio-activation concerns.
