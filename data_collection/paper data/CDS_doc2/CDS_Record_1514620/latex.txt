Introduction

The Phase-2 upgrade of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [1], planned for 2022-2023, will provide conditions rich in possibilities for physics measurements [2], but also extremely challenging experimentally. Following the upgrade, the luminosity of the machine, referred to as the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), is expected to reach \(5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), with a centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Assuming a bunch spacing of 25 ns and the application of luminosity levelling, an average of 140 proton-proton interactions are expected in every bunch crossing at the HL-LHC.

The current ATLAS detector [3], and in particular the Inner Detector, is not suitable for operation in such an environment, and will in any case have reached the end of its useful lifetime due to the accumulated radiation damage and sensor ageing. The Inner Detector must therefore be replaced if the best use is to be made of the upgraded LHC. An all-silicon tracker is the preferred solution for such conditions, since it affords the best balance between measurement precision and material profile. This Phase-2 Inner Tracker upgrade is here referred to as the _ITk_, to distinguish it from the current Inner Detector (ID).

In order to establish whether a tracker design offers the desired performance under these conditions, detailed simulation studies must be carried out, allowing various aspects of the expected tracking performance for this design to be characterised.

### Event Simulation, Digitization and Reconstruction

These simulation studies are carried out within the ATLAS Athena framework [4], [5], using for the most part the full Monte Carlo production chain (Simulation, Digitization, and Reconstruction) [6]. This has advantages and disadvantages for such studies. The advantages are that the framework is detailed, complete, fully validated and the simulated and digitized data is fully compatible with ATLAS offline reconstruction described in Sec. 1.1.1. The major disadvantage is that it is strongly tailored to the current ATLAS design, and does not have full flexibility built-in for studies of designs that deviate from this.

The design of the detector to be studied is defined using the GeoModel package [7]. GeoModel defines detector elements (such as sensors, modules, support structures, service materials, etc.) based on parameters in a database (the ATLAS Detector Description Database, DDDB [8]). GeoModel then interfaces with the simulation toolkit Geant4 [9], [10], [11], building up a software model of the complete detector design through which the transport of particles can be simulated.

The Digitization package takes the simulated energy deposits, and models the detector's electronic response. For this, every readout channel is assigned an _identifier_ which addresses it uniquely within the detector. ATLAS software releases have recently been produced which are fully compatible with the 64-bit identifier schema needed to uniquely address every channel in the ITk design, meaning that such designs can be _embedded_ within the current ATLAS detector description, in place of the current Inner Detector. The majority of the samples used for the performance studies described in this document are produced without including any detectors outside the Inner Tracker, since such samples require considerably less CPU time and memory to produce.

#### 1.1.1 Track Reconstruction

Raw events produced by the digitization modelling are then reconstructed using the standard ATLAS Inner Detector iterative track reconstruction chain [12]. In the first iteration, track seeds are formed from all possible combinations of three pixel space points. For each seed, a search road is defined based on an estimation of the track parameters and a full combinatorial Kalman Filter is then carried out within this road in order to find one or more track candidates based on this seed. In further iterations, pixel plus strip seeds and three strip space point seeds are also constructed and used to form tracks, which helps to recover inefficiencies due to insufficient pixel hits. Sophisticated bookkeeping is used to remove previously-used hits from subsequent track finding iterations, limiting the combinatorial overhead in terms of CPU and memory.

_Ambiguity processing_ is to select the good tracks from the full set of track candidates. At this stage, a fully-fledged track fit with detailed material corrections is used to precisely estimate the track parameters and reject bad track candidates. The material corrections in the fit rely on a precise modelling of the detector material used in the simulation. To facilitate this, a dedicated tuning of the so-called _Tracking Geometry_[13] was carried out to correctly model the ITk material effects in the fit.

In this note, the bremsstrahlung reconstruction feature of the ATLAS track reconstruction is used to study the electron performance in the ITk. For electron tracks, a modified material model is used in the combinatorial Kalman Filter to allow for bremsstrahlung effects. The track fitter then allows for a change in curvature, via the addition of a _bremsstrahlung point_, due to forward photon radiation from the electron in the detector material.

### Pile-up Scenarios

To recreate the beam conditions provided by the HL-LHC, the simulated signal processes for which we wish to study the performance will be overlaid with a large number of additional _pile-up_ collisions. These pile-up collisions are picked randomly from sets of minimum bias events; the minimum bias is generated using Pythia 8, with inelastic, low-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) settings, and simulated in an identical way to the signal, before being combined at the digitization step.

Samples are produced with a level of pile-up matching the nominal average of 140, as shown in Fig. 1, and additionally with a level of 200, to provide an an extreme scenario for study. For the _tracker only_ samples mentioned above, only _in-time_ pile-up (i.e. within the same bunch crossing as the signal) is considered, since the effect of out-of-time pile-up (in neighbouring bunch crossings) is negligible. The

Reconstructed tracks are shown in green, with pixel and strip clusters in orange and yellow respectively.

production vertices of all particles are _smeared_ in order to recreate the expected beam spot dimensions for the HL-LHC of \(\sigma^{beamspot}_{x/y}=12\;\mu\)m in the \(x/y\) plane and \(\sigma^{beamspot}_{z}=75\) mm in the \(z\) direction.

## 2 The LoI Layout

The ITk layout that will be considered in this document is the so-called _Letter of Intent_ (LoI) layout which was developed in order to satisfy the performance and design requirements for an ATLAS Phase 2 tracker, as defined in [15]. The LoI layout improves over the earlier so-called UTOPIA [13] layout, which had previously been used for ITk studies. An initial layout (referred to at the _Cartigny_ layout), optimised for performance, was developed based on results from full Geant4 MC simulations and an analytical tracking model. This was subsequently revised to account for engineering and hardware considerations, resulting in the LoI layout. A short overview of this layout will be given here; detailed design considerations can be found in [16].

### Sensitive Layers

As discussed in Sec. 1 the ITk will be an all-silicon tracker, and will be composed of two subsystem; one using pixel sensor technology and the other silicon microstrips (_strips_), Fig. 2. The position of all sensitive layers in the LoI layout can be seen in Fig. 3. The basic parameters of the layout are listed in Appendix A.

#### 2.1.1 Pixel System

The LoI Pixel system is composed of four barrel layers, with radii from 39 mm for the inner layer1 to 250 mm for the outer layer, and six endcap disks at \(z\)-positions from \(\pm 877\) mm for the innermost disk to \(\pm 1675\) mm for the outermost. The two innermost barrel layers have pixels of size \(25\times 150\;\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) (\(\phi\times\eta\)), while the remaining barrel layers and endcap disks use pixels of size \(50\times 250\;\mu\)m\({}^{2}\). The positioning of modules in the barrel layers, showing \(\phi\) tilt and overlap, can be seen in Fig. 4(a).

Figure 3: Sensitive layers in the LoI layout (r-z view), with the Pixel and Strip systems shown in red and blue respectively.

#### 2.1.2 Strip System

The LoI Strip system surrounds the Pixel system, and consists of five (full length) barrel layers, with radii from 405 - 1000 mm, and seven endcap disks at \(z\)-positions between \(\pm\)1415 mm and \(\pm\)3000 mm. In addition to the five full length barrel layers, short _stub cylinders_ are placed at either end of the barrel between the fouth and fifth full layers, as can be seen in Fig. 3. These stub cylinders provide coverage in an \(\eta\) region which otherwise has a deficiency of hits, resulting in a loss of tracking robustness and \(p_{T}\) resolutions. The average number of hits per track for the LoI layout is shown in Fig. 5 for tracks originating both from the centre of the detector, and also from the \(2\times\sigma_{Z}^{beamspot}\) position at 15 cm. Note that the strip sensors are double sided (with a 40 mrad stereo angle rotation), and so every layer effectively provides two _hits_ which are combined into a single _space point_ in reconstruction. This layout therefore provides at least 14 possible hits per track in the region \(|\eta|<2.5\), which is sufficient to allow robust track reconstruction requiring \(\geq 11\) hits per track (discussed further in Sec. 4.3) with adequate redundancy to protect against module failures.

Strips of length 23.82 mm are used in the inner three layers, and of length 47.64 mm in the outer two layers and stub cylinders. A strip pitch of 75 \(\mu\)m is used throughout the barrel. The positioning of the modules in the barrel layers is shown in Fig. 4(b).

In the endcap, the strip lengths range from 8.1 mm in the innermost region to 58.3 mm, with angular pitches in \(\phi\) from 0.0192 to 0.0085 mrad. These dimensions are based on the assumption of using the _Petal_ design for the strip endcaps. However, within the simulation the strip endcaps are implemented as rings of trapezoidal modules, as is done for the ATLAS ID. Work is ongoing to provide a detailed description of the petal strip endcaps in the ATLAS software framework, which will correctly model not only the petal support structures, but also the geometry of the sensors (for instance, non-parallel sides and curved edges in one possible implementation [18]) and their subdivision into strips (including rotations with respect to the radial direction, and in another possible implementation, truncated strips with ganged readout).

Further parameters of the layout as implemented in simulation can be found in the appendix.

### Support Structures and Services

In order to facilitate replacement of the pixel system in the case of catastrophic failure, two pixel _support tubes_ allow extraction of the entire Pixel system, and the innermost two pixel barrel layers, independent of the rest of the ITk. The Inner Support Tube (IST) at a radius of 110 mm encompasses the two innermost pixels layers, and the Pixel Support Tube (PST) at a radius of 347 mm encompasses the entire pixel system. Both are implemented as simple carbon fibre cylinders within the simulation.

In addition to the overall support structures and services, the average material budget was tuned separately for _local_ (i.e. fully-equipped steave) and _global_ (i.e. supports for each barrel strip layer) support structures. For the barrel pixel subsystem, conservative estimates of 1.5% \(X_{0}\) and 2% \(X_{0}\) were used for the inner two and outer two layers respectively2. The material in the pixel endcap disks was tuned to correspond to 2% \(X_{0}\) plus sensor material. The barrel strip subsystem constitutes 2.5% \(X_{0}\) and 2% \(X_{0}\) in the three inner and two outer plus stub cylinders, respectively. In addition, there is a supporting cylinder of 0.386% \(X_{0}\) for each but the stub strip layer (thin lines parallel to the strip staves on Fig. 6(a)). In the strip endcaps the total material per disk was tuned to match an estimate of 2% \(X_{0}\) per petal adding a conservative estimate of 0.5% \(X_{0}\) per disk to account for a global support frame.

Footnote 2: Hereafter material is quoted for perpendicular traversal of a single detector element, e.g. a steave.

The overall material profile for material within the tracker volume of the LoI layout is shown in Fig. 6(b). This plot includes material outside the active tracking acceptance, i.e. lying beyond the last tracking hit at a given \(\eta\). Such material does not affect the tracking performance directly, but could have indirect effects on quantities such as the occupancy through back-splash, etc. The _pixel_ and _strip_ material includes both sensitive and support material, but not service material, which is collected together in the contribution shown in light brown.

## 3 Occupancies

A fundamental property to be considered in designing a tracking detector is the expected occupancy, as this can have significant consequences for the design of the read-out electronics; if the channel occupancy becomes too high it can cause problems due to dead-time. The hit occupancy is defined as:

\[\text{Occupancy}=\frac{\text{Number of hits per module, per event}}{\text{Number of readout channels per module}} \tag{1}\]

Figure 6: The LoI layout in the r-z plane, showing all (active and passive) material (a), and the average amount of material in \(X_{0}\) within the ITk volume, as contributed by different categories of material (b).

This quantity is therefore independent of any track reconstruction or hit clustering applied.

Figure 7 shows the expected hit occupancies for the LoI layout under pile-up 200 conditions. It can be seen that the occupancy is \(<1\%\) for the strip detector, and \(<0.25\%\) for the pixel detector, and is therefore comfortably within the expected operational limits of the read-out electronics.

## 4 Track Efficiency and Mis-reconstruction

A crucial performance criteria that must be considered for a tracking detector is the tracking efficiency, the fraction of particles for which a track can be reconstructed. This can be studied in simulation by comparing the number of simulated particles in the truth information to the number of tracks finally reconstructed. However, there are often tracks within an event (especially those with high pile-up) that are not expected to be reconstructable, such as low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) tracks or those outside tracking acceptance, or are not interesting to reconstruct, such as secondary tracks caused by interactions with the detector material. Consequently, the definition of which tracks should enter the efficiency calculation is very important.

### Track Selection

The following cuts are applied to the truth particles, in order to define the tracks that we are interested in reconstructing:

* \(|\eta^{truth}|\leq 2.7\)
* \(|d_{0}^{truth}|<1.0\) mm
* \(|z_{0}^{truth}|<150\) mm
* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{truth}>1\) GeV
* particle barcode \(<2\times 10^{5}\)

The particle barcode used in the final cut a is number that uniquely identifies a particle within an event. Barcodes beyond \(2\times 10^{5}\) are reserved for particles generated within Geant4, i.e. secondaries, and so

Figure 7: R-z map, showing expected hit occupancies under pile-up 200 conditions for the entire Inner Tracker (a) and the Pixel subsystem (b).

these particles are excluded by the selection. To select particles of a specific \(p_{T}\), the \(p_{T}^{truth}\) is required to be within 1% of the specified value.

It is also necessary to define what is classed as a reconstructed track; different use cases (such as \(b\)-tagging, as described in Sec. 7) may require different track requirements, but the standard offline track reconstruction cuts are defined as follows:

* \(|\eta^{rec}|\leq 2.7\)
* \(|d_{0}^{rec}|<1.0\) mm
* \(|\varsigma_{0}^{rec}|<150\) mm
* \(p_{\rm T}^{rec}>1\) GeV
* \(N_{hits}^{si}\geq 11\)
* \(N_{holes}^{pix}\leq 1\)

\(N_{hits}^{si}\) represents the total number of hits-on-track in all layers, and \(N_{holes}^{pix}\) the number of Pixel layers traversed where a hit cannot be associated to a track.

### Tracking Efficiency

As will be discussed further in Sec. 4.3, it is possible that a reconstructed track does not closely match any physical or simulated particle. In order to avoid counting such _fake_ tracks in the efficiency calculation, the track _Matching Probability_, \(P_{match}\), is used. This parameter is defined as follows:

\[P_{match}=\frac{2N_{common}^{pix}+N_{common}^{strip}}{2N_{track}^{pix}+N_{ track}^{strip}} \tag{2}\]

where \(N_{common}^{pix/strip}\) is the number of Pixel/Strip hits common to both the track and the particle to which it is being matched, and \(N_{track}^{pix/strip}\) is the number of Pixel/Strip hits on the track. Reconstructed tracks are required to have \(P_{match}>0.5\) to a selected truth particle. The tracking efficiency, \(\epsilon_{track}\), can therefore be defined as the number of selected reconstructed tracks, with \(P_{match}>0.5\) to a selected truth particle, divided by the number of selected truth particles.

\[\epsilon_{track}=\frac{N_{rec}(selected,matched)}{N_{truth}(selected)} \tag{3}\]

The tracking efficiency is primarily determined from samples of isolated \(e^{\pm}/\mu^{\pm}/\pi^{\pm}\), plus pile-up, at a range of different \(p_{T}\) values (typically 5, 15, 50 and 100 GeV). In this case additional cuts to the truth particles can be applied, selecting them based on their truth particle type and \(p_{T}\) (using a \(\pm 1\) GeV window around the required value), in order to obtain separate efficiencies for each particle type and \(p_{T}\) point. For _inclusive_ tracking efficiencies, such as from \(t\bar{t}\) or QCD jet samples, these additional requirements are not applied.

The efficiencies obtained for the LoI layout using this definition can be seen in Fig. 8 for different particle types and momenta. These display the expected behaviour, with muons having uniformly extremely high efficiency, while pions and electrons lose some efficiency due to material interactions. As discussed in Sec. 1.1.1, the track reconstruction makes use of so-called bremsstrahlung refitting, in order to recover electrons that lose energy through interactions with the detector material. As a consequence, the efficiency for electrons is noticeably higher than for pions in many regimes, since there is no mechanism for recovering pions that undergo a nuclear interaction within the detector.

Figure 8: Tracking efficiencies, using the standard selection defined in Sec. 4, for Muons (a), Pions (b) and Electrons (c) at a range of \(p_{T}\) under the expected phase 2 pile-up conditions, and the tracking efficiency for high and low \(p_{T}\) electrons under increasing pile-up (d). Tracking based on forward pixel tracklets (not shown in this figure) further extends the \(\eta\) coverage beyond 2.5, to complement the coverage of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer.

The efficiencies according to this defintion are very stable under increasing pile-up, with the exception of low \(p_{T}\) electrons, which suffer a moderate efficiency loss under increased pile-up, as shown in Fig. 8(d).

The effiencies were also investigated using a slightly different criteria for selecting the signal tracks; rather than specifying the truth particle type and a tight \(p_{T}\) window, a tight cut on the particle barcode was applied instead. By only allowing barcodes within a narrow range, beginning at 10000, it is possible to specifically require that the particles were produced as part of the signal generation process3, and so pile-up tracks are explicitly excluded. The efficiencies obtained using this definition can be seen in Fig. 9, and are extremely compatible with those shown in Fig. 8.

Footnote 3: This is only true for samples produced containing isolated particles from a _particle gun_ - it is not possible to use the particle barcode to separate signal particles produced by a physics generator such as Pythia in such a way.

The efficiencies for far-forward tracks beyond \(|\eta|=2.5\) are not shown in these plots, since using the standard offline selection with \(N_{hits}^{si}\geq 11\) is not optimal for this region. However, through using tracking based on forward pixel _tracklets_ with different selection requirements (due to the lower number of possible total hits on track), the acceptance of the ITk can be extended to complement that of the ATLAS muon spectrometer.

### Track Mis-reconstruction

As mentioned previously, it is possible for tracks to be reconstructed that do not closely match any single physical or simulated particle, but are instead built up from hits from multiple different particles, and/or noise hits. Significant background contributions can arise due to such _fake_ tracks, and so understanding and minimising the number of fake tracks is highly important when designing a tracking detector. An increase in the number of fake tracks is indicated by an increase in the ratio of reconstructed4 to generated tracks in an event, \(N_{rec}/N_{truth}\), the quantity which is shown for inclusive leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) (with at least one leptonically decaying W boson) as a function of pile-up in Fig. 10.

Footnote 4: In this case, the cuts on \(|\mu_{0}^{rec}|\) and \(|z_{0}^{rec}|\) were relaxed to 2 and 250 mm respectively, in order to emphasise the effect.

In Fig. 10(b), \(N_{rec}/N_{truth}\) requiring \(\geq 11\) hits on track remains approximately constant up to 200 pile-up collisions per event, indicating no large increase in the number of fake tracks. This can be contrasted with Fig. 10(a) in which \(\geq 9\) hits on track are required; in this case, a significant increase in the ratio of

Figure 9: Tracking efficiency as a function of the pseudorapidity, \(\eta\), using the standard selection defined in Sec. 4 with a cut on the particle barcode replacing the truth particle type and \(p_{T}\) window cuts, for Muons, Pions, and Electrons at \(p_{T}=5\) GeV (a) and \(p_{T}=100\) GeV (b) under the expected phase 2 pile-up conditions.

reconstructed to generated tracks can be observed, indicating an increasing number of fake tracks. This demonstrates the advantage of the 14 hit (11 plus redundancy) design discussed in Sec. 2.1.2.

It is also useful to look at a more general class of mis-reconstructed tracks, which were specifically excluded from the tracking efficiency calculation discussed in Sec. 4.2. This class of tracks, which cannot be matched with \(P_{match}>0.5\) to any single truth particle, includes fake tracks but also has contributions from genuine tracks to which hits are mis-associated. The mis-reconstructed track fraction can be defined as:

\[N_{mis}/N_{rec}=\frac{N_{rec}(selected,unmatched)}{N_{rec}(selected)} \tag{4}\]

Figure 11(a) demonstrates an increase in the mis-reconstructed track fraction with increasing pile-up. Contrary to fake tracks, an increase in the number of mis-reconstructed tracks does not strictly imply an increase in the total number of reconstructed tracks, since genuine tracks can migrate into this latter category. This fraction is overall very small; even in the most problematic region, \(1.5<|\eta|<2.5\) corresponding to the barrel-endcap transition, it is below 0.1%. Figure 11(b) further demonstrates the advantage of requiring \(\geq 11\) hits on track, which reduces the mis-reconstructed track fraction significantly compared to a \(\geq 9\) hit track selection.

## 5 Resolutions

Reconstructing tracks with a high efficiency and high purity, as discussed in Sec. 4, is of limited use if the track resolution in key parameters is not good. Among the most important tracking parameters are the following:

* longitudinal and transverse impact parameter, \(z_{0}\) and \(d_{0}\)
* polar and azimuthal angle, \(\theta\) and \(\phi\)
* transverse momentum, \(p_{T}\)

Figure 10: Ratio of reconstructed to generated tracks in inclusive-leptonic \(t\overline{t}\) events as a function of the number of true pile-up collisions per event, requiring \(\geq 9\) (a) and \(\geq 11\) (b) hits on track.

The resolutions for these parameters can be obtained from simulation by comparing their reconstructed values for a given particle with the MC truth value. The track selection applied to determine which tracks enter in to the resolution calculations is identical to that defined in Sec. 4.1 for the efficiency calculation.

To define the resolution, the difference between the reconstructed and generated variable is computed for each event and then plotted. In order to control outliers in the tails, the RMS of the distribution is calculated and any points beyond \(\pm 3\times\)RMS are removed. The RMS of the distribution is then re-calculated, and it is this RMS that is taken as the parameter resolution, \(\sigma\).

It is also possible to make estimates of the predicted efficiency of a given layout through analytical methods, as shown in [16], which can be compared to those obtained through full simulation.

In Fig. 12(a) to 12(e), the resolutions for the main tracking parameters with muons are shown. Since muons (in particular at high \(p_{T}\)) are less affected by detector material than other particle types, as discussed previously in Sec. 4.2, they give a better idea of resolution of the layout as determined by factors such as the lever-arm in the magnetic field, and the intrinsic resolution of the sensors. The effect of material interactions on the resolutions is demonstrated in Fig. 12(f), which compares the \(q/p_{T}\) resolution for different particle types at high and low \(p_{T}\).

## 6 Vertexing

Another performance challenge for a tracking detector operating under high pile-up is the reconstruction of vertices. The tracks entering in to the vertex reconstruction shown in this section have a slightly looser selection, applied at the reconstruction level, than the offline selection cuts described in Sec. 4.1. The main differences are:

* \(|d_{0}^{rec}|<2.0\) mm
* \(|z_{0}^{rec}|<250\) mm
* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{rec}>900\) MeV
* \(N_{hits}^{si}\geq 9\)
* \(N_{holes}^{pix}\leq 3\)

Figure 11: Mis-reconstructed track fraction from inclusive-leptonic \(t\overline{t}\) events under a range of pile-up conditions (a), and a comparison of the mis-reconstructed track fraction under the expected phase 2 pile-up conditions using \(\geq\)11 and \(\geq\)9 hit selections (b).

Figure 12: Resolutions in \(q/p_{T}\) (a), \(z_{0}\) (b), \(d_{0}\) (c), \(\theta\) (d) and \(\phi\) (e) for Muons at a range of \(p_{T}\) under the expected phase 2 pile-up conditions, and a comparison of the \(q/p_{T}\) resolution in different particles types at high and low \(p_{T}\) with pile-up 140 conditions (f), using the standard selection defined in Sec. 4.

Aside from changes to track selection, the vertexing applied is the same as for current ATLAS reconstruction, and no optimisation of the vertexing algorithms for high pile-up conditions has been made. Figure 13 shows the number of vertices that are reconstructed on average per event in this scheme with increasing pile-up, of up to 200 pile-up collisions per event. While the deviation from linearity in this figure indicates a reduced vertex reconstruction efficiency at high pile-up, there is no sudden transition which would indicate a limitation of the vertex reconstruction that could not be overcome with optimisation of the algorithms, and no large increase in the number of reconstructed vertices that would indicate a growing problem with fake vertices.

Likewise, the selection of primary vertices currently has no high pile-up optimisation, and the Primary Vertex (PV) is selected on the basis of having the highest \(\Sigma(p_{T}^{track})^{2}\). The resolution for primary vertices selected in such a way is shown in Fig. 14, for primary vertices from inclusive-leptonic \(\tilde{t}\) events under pile-up 23 and 140 conditions. It can be seen that the resolution of the primary vertex selected in this way is very good (around 6 \(\mu\)m in \(x\) and 14 \(\mu\)m in \(z\) for the expected phase 2 pile-up conditions), and is also very robust under increasing pile-up.

These vertexing results assume the beam spot scenario described in Sec. 1.2. For other potential HL-LHC beam spot sizes, e.g. where a large crossing angle results in a significantly smaller luminous region, the vertexing performance could be significantly different.

## 7 B-Tagging, Mass resolution and high \(p_{T}\) Jets

### B-tagging

The analysis of many interesting physics channels relies heavily on the ability to distinguish between jets originating from b-hadrons and light-flavour jets, meaning that the so-called _b-tagging_ performance is an important consideration for the upgraded tracker design. This is particularly relevant in the case of the Phase-2 upgrade, since the identification of b-jets is complicated significantly by the presence of additional tracks from pile-up collisions.

For studying the b-tagging, the main parameter studied was the combined weight output by two b-tagging algorithms, the so-called IP3D and SV1 algorithms [19]. These are robust and well-understood

Figure 13: The average number of reconstructed vertices per event, as a function of the true number of pile-up collisions in the event.

algorithms that use Impact Parameter significance distributions (in the case of IP3D) and Secondary Vertex reconstruction (in the case of SV1) to identify b-jets. These were applied to samples of inclusive-leptonic \(\vec{t}\) under a varety of different pile-up conditions. As a benchmark for comparison, the same analysis was also performed for equivalent samples produced using the _ATLAS+IBL_ tracker layout. The results are shown in Fig. 15.

The curves shown in Fig. 15 show the light-jet rejection as a function of the b-tagging efficiency, obtained by applying different cuts on the combined IP3D+SV1 weight. A general decrease in performance can be observed as the number of pile-up collisions increases, but it should be noted that even at \(<\mu>\)=140, the performance of the LoI layout is better than that of the ATLAS+IBL layout with no pile-up. This is an important observation, as one of the main aims of the tracker re-design is to mitigate the effects of increased pile-up, as is shown here.

Fig. 16 shows the dependence of the b-tagging efficiency on the jet \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\), using a fixed IP3D+SV1 weight, corresponding to an average b-tagging efficiency of 60%, for inclusive-leptonic \(\vec{t}\) under the expected HL-LHC conditions.

### High \(p_{T}\) jets

One of the biggest challenges for tracking is the reconstruction of tracks within the core of high-\(p_{T}\) jets, where the local hit density is extremely high. An interesting parameter to consider is the number of shared clusters, in which multiple tracks contribute to the same cluster, as this gives an intrinsic measure of the limitations on two-track separation. This is shown in Fig. 17 for the innermost pixel and strip layers. The results were produced using truth-seeded tracking on a J6 QCD di-jet slice, comprising jets with \(p_{T}\) between 560 and 1120 GeV, and show the fraction of shared clusters as a function of the distance from the jet axis. These plots demostrate a significantly increased density of tracks in the innermost region of these high-\(p_{T}\) jets, with up to approximately 12.5% of clusters being shared for the innermost pixel layer.

## 8 Conclusions

The 'LoI' tracker layout, designed to operate as part of an upgraded ATLAS detector under HL-LHC conditions, has been successfully implemented in the ATLAS simulation framework.

A number of data samples have been simulated, digitised and reconstructed using this layout, with a variety of different pile-up levels included, and these samples have been used for performance studies. The samples were produced as _tracker stand-alone_ samples, i.e. the rest of the ATLAS detector such as the calorimeters and muon stations was not simulated. This was done in order to save CPU resources, since the simulation of full ATLAS events with HL-LHC levels of pile-up is computationally expensive, and for the studies performed the tracker can largely be treated as decoupled from the rest of the detector. Production of samples in which the _LoI ITk_ replaces the current Inner Detector within the full ATLAS detector are currently in production. These samples will allow the effect of improved tracking on the overall ATLAS physics performance to be established.

The results of the studies presented here are highly encouraging, showing that this tracker layout meets the criteria that were specified during the design phase. The channel occupancies remain below 1% throughout the entire ITk under pile-up 200 conditions. The tracking efficiencies are high for all particle types over the expected \(p_{T}\) range of interest, and thanks to its constant \(\geq\) 14 hit coverage, robust tracking cuts can be applied which result in extremely low rates of fake and mis-reconstructed tracks (\(\leq\) 0.1%). Excellent \(p_{T}\) and impact parameter resolutions are obtained, thanks to the large lever arm, fine granularity and low material budget. Particularly encouraging are the b-tagging results, shown in Sec. 7, which demonstrate that the new tracker completely mitigates the effect of increased pile-up on b-tagging performance, and performs better than the current Inner Detector (including the Insertable B-layer) at much lower levels of pile-up.
