**Abstract**

Search strategies for gluinos at LHC through their cascade decay into isolated same sign charged dileptons are studied. The dominant background process is \(pp\to t\bar{t}\ X\), where both \(W\)'s decay into leptons and one of the charge of the leptons is mismeasured. Another background process is also \(pp\to t\bar{t}\ X\), where one of the same sign dilepton comes from the decay of \(W\) and the other comes from \(b\)-decay of the other top quark. If the probability of the misassignment of isolated lepton charge is controlled within \(O(10^{-3})\), gluino mass accessible at LHC is \(\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$<$}}1\) TeV.

Phenomenology

LHC is an ideal place to search for strongly interacting new heavy particles like gluinos. Gluino, the supersymmetric partner of a gluon, is a spin 1/2 Majorana particle. Even if all the other supersymmetric particles are heavy, gluinos can be pair produced from a virtual gluon. Therefore, cross section is large even for heavy gluinos of \(M_{\tilde{g}}=1\) TeV, as shown in Fig.1. Also a gluino can be produced associated with a squark, if the squark is as light as the gluino.

Decay mode of the gluino was expected to be simple if the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is photino (or the lightest neutralino, in general) and gluino is the second lightest supersymmetric particle (SLSP). In this case, the gluino decays into \(q\bar{q}\tilde{\gamma}\) (via a virtual \(\tilde{q}\)) or into \(g+\tilde{\gamma}\) (via one loop). Expected missing \(E_{t}\) of the gluino events is large because photino carries away a large fraction of transverse momentum.

However, in the parameter space of minimal supersymmetric standard model, the branching fraction of cascade decay of the gluino into unstable charginos or neutralinos is recognized to be important[1]. In general, if gluino is not SLSP and decays into a heavy gaugino which then decays into the LSP and (real or virtual) \(W\) or \(Z\), missing \(E_{t}\) is expected to be smaller than the SLSP case. Although the decay modes are complicated for most of the cascade decay, same sign dileptons is one of the distinctive signature which can be used to look for the gluino. The same sign dilepton comes from a same sign \(W\)-boson pair naturally produced from the decay of the gluino pair, since gluino is a Majorana particle. The physics sources of the same sign isolated dilepton are extensively studied as background processes to the strongly interacting gauge bosons \(W^{\pm}+W^{\pm}\to W^{\pm}+W^{\pm}\) at SSC, and the rate is found to be rather low[3][4]. On the other hand, rate of the opposite sign charged dilepton is high, since they come from the process of \(t\bar{t}\to W^{+}b+W^{-}\bar{b}\to\ell^{+}\nu b+\ell^{-}\bar{\nu}\bar{b}\). Therefore the main background for the same sign isolated charge leptons might be the opposite isolated charged leptons from \(t\bar{t}\) where one of the lepton charged is mismeasured.

## 2 Monte Carlo Studies of Same Sign Dilepton Searches)

We use the ISASUSY Monte Carlo event generator for the production of gluino events. In this study, the following input SUSY parameters, which are expected to be not too sensitive to the cross section and decay branching fractions of gluino, are fixed to their 'typical' values:

\[M_{\tilde{q}} = 2\ M_{\tilde{g}}\quad(squark\ mass) \tag{1}\] \[\tan\beta = 2\quad\quad(Ratio\ of\ vacuum\ expectation\ values)\] (2) \[M_{H^{\pm}} = 500\ GeV\quad\quad(Charged\ Higgs\ mass)\] (3) \[M_{t} = 140\ GeV\quad\quad(Top\ mass). \tag{4}\]

The two remaining parameters, \(M_{\tilde{g}}\) (gluino mass) and \(\mu=-2M_{1}\) (Higgisino mixing parameter), are varied. For a given set of the above parameters, production cross section and decay branching fractions of gluinos are calculated in ISASUSY, which is interfaced to the ISAJET event generator. In ISAJET, initial state and final state parton cascades, as well as fragmentation of partons and decay of unstable particles are simulated.

For the \(t\bar{t}\) background, the Monte Carlo event generator PYTHIA, which is based on JETSET program package, is used to generate the events. Since it is difficult to generate Monte Carlo \(t\bar{t}\) events with reasonably large integrated luminosity because of the large cross section (3.2 \(10^{3}\) pb), all \(W\)'s from top quarks are forced to decay into electrons or muons and the \(b\) quarks are also forced to decay semileptonically. Therefore there are at least two pairs of same sign dileptons in an event. Strictly speaking, missing \(E_{t}\) of the single same sign dilepton event is expected to be smaller than that for the double same sign dileptons. Since missing \(E_{t}>100\) GeV is required for each event, as will be described later, the evaluation of the background level by scaling up the result obtained using the above sample is over estimation, hence it is conservative.

The detector simulation is done by smearing momentum or energy of the final state particles, which are emitted within the detector acceptance[5]. Since an isolated same sign dilepton is required to exist in an event, the result is expected to be insensitive to the detailed detector performances, except for the charge misidentification probability of the isolated leptons.

The actual event selection criteria are:

**(1)**: Event is required to have at least one isolated same sign dilepton which satisfies the following criteria:

* Both leptons have \(|\vec{p}_{t}|\) greater than 30 GeV and are emitted within \(|\eta|<2.5\).
* Isolation criteria for an electron is that the total electromagnetic- plus hadronic-energy deposit is less than 5 GeV in the region between the cones of \(\Delta R=0.3\) and \(\Delta R=0.04\) around the track (\(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\)).
* Isolation criteria for an muon is that the total electromagnetic- plus hadronic-energy deposit is less than 5 GeV in the region within the cone of \(\Delta R=0.3\) around the track.
**(2)**: Missing transverse energy of the event is required to be greater than 100 GeV.

In Fig.2 (a-e), scatter plots of smaller \(p_{t}\) of the isolated leptons vs missing \(E_{t}\) is shown for events with an isolated same sign dilepton (with preselection of \(p_{t}>20\) GeV) for gluino pair production with various gluino masses. In the figures, the cuts mentioned above are also indicated as two solid lines. As can be seen from the figures, detection efficiency is increased while increasing the gluino mass.

The same plot for the \(t\bar{t}\) background is shown in Fig.3, where real same sign dileptons (dileptons due to charge misidentification are not included) are plotted. In this case, one of the isolated leptons comes most probably from \(b\)-semileptonic decay. Increasing the \(p_{t}\) cut value, and hence increasing the boost factor of the \(b\) quark, this background should diminish rapidly. In Fig.4, the same distribution for opposite sign isolated dileptons from \(t\bar{t}\) are plotted. In this case, most of the isolated leptons are from \(W\) decay, hence they have relatively large \(p_{t}\). If the misassignment probability of the lepton charge is large, the major background comes from this source.

The effective cross sections after all the cuts as a function of gluino mass are plotted in Fig.5 for \(\mu=-440\) GeV, \(-300\) GeV and \(-150\) GeV. Also indicated in the figure is the background level of real same sign dileptons from \(t\bar{t}\) without charge misassignment (solid line with dashed lines for \(\pm\sigma_{M.C.stat}\)) and with charge misassignment probabilities of \(10^{-3}\), \(10^{-4}\) and \(10^{-5}\) for opposite sign isolated leptons from \(t\bar{t}\) (dotted lines).

For high mass gluinos (\(M_{\tilde{g}}\geq 750\) GeV), lepton \(p_{t}\) cut value [cut 1(a)] is increased from 30 GeV to 50 GeV to reduce the background. The effective cross section after all the cuts (including \(p_{t}>50\) GeV) as a function of gluino mass is plotted in Fig.6 for \(\mu=-440\) GeV, \(-300\) GeV and \(-150\) GeV. Also indicated in the figure are the 68 % C.L. of the background level of real same sign dileptons from \(t\bar{t}\) (dashed line), as well as the background level expected for opposite sign isolated leptons from \(t\bar{t}\) with charge misassignment probabilities of \(10^{-3}\) and \(10^{-4}\) (dotted lines).

In conclusion, it is possible to find gluino pair production by searching for the same sign isolated dileptons from their cascade decay, up to gluino mass of \(\approx 1\) TeV, if charge misassignment probability for the isolated leptons is less than \(10^{-3}\) with relatively small integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). If this probability is controlled within \(10^{-4}\), gluinos with mass greater than 1200 GeV can be accessible with the same luminosity. The final observable cross section is not so sensitive to the SUSY parameter \(\mu\) as expected.

In order to reduce \(t\bar{t}\) background further, an invariant mass cut of a lepton and the nearest jet, which is proposed by the SDC collaboration[3], will be studied in the near future.
