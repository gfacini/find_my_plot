###### Abstract

Results of tests with the ATLAS Tilecal cooling system used for the calibration in the H8 beam line are presented. In particular the influence of ambient temperature was studied, the foreseen pipe for the final Tilecal cooling system was tested, the efficiency of the cooling and the ideal flow during operation was evaluated for the final electronics and the temperature increase inside the front end electronics was investigated for a disconnected cooling system. The calorimeter response obtained with the Cs calibration system at different cooling temperatures is given.

## 1 Introduction

The new leakless cooling system for the calibration of Tilecal modules was installed in the H8 beam, working successfully in the summer calibration period 2001 and 2002. Due to beam time constraints only 12% of the Tilecal modules will be calibrated with a particle beam. Therefore an identical cooling station will be used for the calibration of all the modules with a Cs source. Also the second unit was already successfully operated in several performed tests and will start operation for the module calibration at the end of 2002.

In both prototype cooling systems the _Leakless Cooling System_ ([6],[3]) is implemented. It uses sub-atmospheric pressure to prevent the cooling liquid from leaking. The Leakless cooling system was chosen for the final ATLAS Calorimetry (Tilecal and LArg) cooling system and will also be used in other detectors like ALICE.

A heat dissipation of 300 W is expected from one superdrawer. 200 W from the electronics in the superdrawers and 100 W from the low voltagepower supply in the fingers. In the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter there will be 256 superdrawers corresponding to an overall power dissipation of 77 kW. As the finger power supply is not yet available an external, non-cooled source was used. Nominal cooling temperature and flow was kept at 18\({}^{\circ}\)C and 60 l/h respectively.

## 2 The Cooling System

The cooling system used for the calibration consist of the cooling unit, the piping and the cooling monitoring system including software and hardware components. It is designed to evacuate 2 kW, hence six superdrawers can be cooled simultaneously. A detailed description of the cooling system is given in the document [1].

## 3 Influence of cooling water temperature on the PMT temperature

In August 2000 a test was carried out in order to evaluate the dependence of the PMT temperature on the cooling water temperature. A former test, performed with a smaller temperature range of the cooling water (16 to 22\({}^{\circ}\)C) and only two superdrawers, presented in [1], indicated that the PMT temperature changes approximately by half of the cooling water temperature, imposing that the cooling water temperature has to be stable within 5\({}^{\circ}\)C. With the new obtained data it was possible to cover a bigger temperature range (18 to 31\({}^{\circ}\)C) and to investigate six different superdrawers simultaneously.

For the test the cooling water temperature was changed from 18 to 31\({}^{\circ}\)C. The PMT temperatures were measured with NTC temperature sensors, placed beside the PMT block 22 inside the superdrawers. The results of the test are shown in figure 1. It was found that the relation between cooling water temperature and PMT temperature follows in average the expression:

\[\Delta T(\mathrm{PMT})=0.74*\Delta T(\mathrm{cooling}) \tag{1}\]

The conclusion can be drawn that in order to achieve the required stability of the PMT temperature of 2.5\({}^{\circ}\)C, the cooling water temperature has to be kept stable within 3.4\({}^{\circ}\)C.

Figure 1: _The PMT block 22 temperatures of six superdrawers, calibrated in the August 2002 beam period are shown versus changing cooling water temperature. By computing the average behaviour the expression \(\Delta\)T(PMT) = 0.74 * \(\Delta\)T(cooling) was found._

Calorimeter response to Cesium calibration for different cooling temperatures

In August 2002 the calorimeter response versus temperature was studied by using the Tilecal Cesium calibration system [2]. The cooling temperature was increased stepwise and finally the cooling was switched off. For each step a \({}^{137}\)Cs-run was taken after a sufficient stabilisation time of several hours. The big difference to the preceding study with a particle beam [1] was that the response of all the 45 PMTs in the superdrawer could be measured simultaneously. The scanned superdrawer was Module 0, positive \(\eta\) side. As temperature reference inside the superdrawer the sensor beside PMT block 22 was taken.

When the Cs source crosses the scintillating tiles, light is produced, propagates through the wave-length-shifting (WLS) fibres and is read out by the PMTs. The signals are integrated for each tile-row in a cell and the average is computed. These values are used to compare the response for different temperatures.

The result is presented in figure 2. A temperature range inside the superdrawer from 19 to 39\({}^{\circ}\)C could be covered and the calorimeter response was normalised to the first measurement, represented by the circle without error bars. At each temperature two consecutive measurements were taken. According to the linear fit the response changes like:

\[\frac{\Delta I}{I}=-0.17\%/^{\circ}C_{PMT} \tag{2}\]

This result agrees with the previous measurement performed in summer 2001 with the particle beam [1]. The old result showed a dependency on the PMT temperature of \(\Delta\)E/E = -0.2% / \({}^{\circ}\)C\({}_{PMT}\).

The error of the measurement is getting bigger for increasing temperatures because the gains of the 45 PMTs do not vary in exactly the same way with the temperature.

When the individual PMTs were studied it was found that not all of them behaved in the same way. Some of them showed to be more sensitive to temperature changes than others. Two examples are presented in figure 3. The left graph shows a PMT (#20) with average behaviour. It changes the gain according to \(\Delta\)I/I = -0.2 % /\({}^{\circ}\)C\({}_{PMT}\). The graph on the right shows a PMT (#3) which is only very little influenced by temperature. Its relation between gain and temperature is \(\Delta\)I/I = -0.06 % /\({}^{\circ}\)C\({}_{PMT}\). It was checked if this different sensitivity is connected with the positions of the PMTs inside the superdrawer but no spatial dependence could be observed.

Figure 2: _The response of module 0, \(\eta\)+, (45 PMTs) for different temperatures using the Cs calibration system. The response is normalised to the first measurement, represented by the circle without error bars. With increasing temperature the response decreases. This outcome coincides with the result found in the study with the particle beam._

In figure 4 the distribution of the gain change of 45 PMTs inside the superdrawer is shown. A Gaussian fit is applied and the number of PMTs inside and outside the one \(\sigma\) interval are given. According to the distribution 25 PMTs behave in the standard way. Nine PMTs show a higher sensitivity to temperature changes and eight PMTs are rather insensitive. It can be seen that there is one PMT (#45) with a change of gain of +0.1 % /\({}^{\circ}\)C\({}_{PMT}\), which does not follow the general behaviour. This value can be explained because this PMT had higher noise than the others and furthermore its signal was unusually low and close to the pedestal. Therefore there is a large error related to this value.

## 5 Influence of the ambient temperature on the cooling water temperature

The stability of the cooling system has been monitored in the September 2001 calibration period [1]. A very good stability of 0.1\({}^{\circ}\)C (r.m.s.) could be observed which is perfectly sufficient for the requirements of the electronics. But we also observed a correlation between the cooling water temperature and the ambient temperature (see figure 5).

Figure 3: _The change of gain of two individual PMTs during a temperature change of \(\sim\) 20\({}^{\circ}\)C is shown. The left graph shows a PMT (#20) with average behaviour -0.2 % \(\diagup\)C\({}_{PMT}\) and the right one a PMT (#3) which is insensitive to temperature changes (-0.06 % \(\diagup\)C\({}_{PMT}\))._

Figure 4: _The distribution of the gain change due to temperature variation of all PMTs of Module 0, positive \(\eta\), is shown. In the one \(\sigma\) interval there are 25 PMTs which can be regarded as ’standard’, nine PMTs are more sensitive to temperature changes and eight PMTs are rather insensitive. One PMT (#45) was not working properly and therefore gave a unusual high value of +0.10 % /\({}^{\circ}C_{PMT}\)._

Figure 5: _The figure shows the ambient and the cooling temperature in a period in August 2001. Note that two different y-scales are used. The cooling temperature clearly follows the oscillation of the ambient temperature. The relation \(\Delta\)T-cooling = 0.163\({}^{\circ}\)C / \({}^{\circ}\)C(ambient) was found for this period. Still the stability of the cooling unit is 0.1\({}^{\circ}\)C._

### Dependency on the ambient temperature

Figure 5 shows a six days period in August 2001. It is clearly visible that the cooling water temperature (T-cooling) follows the change of the ambient temperature at a smaller scale. In fact the change in August was

\[\Delta T_{Cooling}=0.163^{\circ}C/^{\circ}C_{ambient}. \tag{3}\]

An influence of the ambient temperature is worrying because the calibration of the modules will be performed at different times in the year and in different buildings. Hence rather big ambient temperature differences are preprogrammed and would influence the cooling temperature and consequentially the temperature in the superdrawers. In order to obtain good calibration results this influence should be minimised. On the other hand it has to be remarked that the influence of changes of the ambient temperature on the cooling water does not affect us in the ATLAS pit because there will be no such changes of the ambient temperature.

The next step was to try to get an overview of the influence of the ambient temperature over a broader temperature range. Therefore data from August, September and November 2001 was collected and an ambient temperature range from 13 to 24\({}^{\circ}\)C could be covered. Averaged over those months a change of the cooling water temperature of 0.11\({}^{\circ}\)C / \({}^{\circ}\)C(ambient) was found.

Following the performed measurements a range of ambient temperature in the order of magnitude of 10\({}^{\circ}\)C can be anticipated indoors between summer and winter. The resulting variation of cooling water temperature would be:

\[\Delta T_{Cooling}=1.1^{\circ}C\quad per\quad 10^{\circ}C\Delta T_{ambient} \tag{4}\]

Although this is well inside the limit of 3.4\({}^{\circ}\)C which was found in the study of the calorimeter response (presented in [1]) it was decided to further study this effect and to try to reduce the influence of the ambient temperature.

Figure 6 shows the behaviour of the cooling water temperature versus the ambient temperature. It gives an overview of the expected temperature gradient in the buildings for different seasons (August, September, November - in each month the temperatures where monitored during periods of several days).

After a closer investigation of the dependence it was discovered that the temperature sensor of the PID is the weak point in the system. This sensorFigure 6: _The cooling water temperature versus the ambient for periods of several days in the three different months August, September and November is shown. An overall range of 11\({}^{\circ}\)C is covered which corresponds to the expected temperature gradient of the buildings between summer and winter. The dependence of the cooling water temperature is given for each month, the average dependence shows a change of 1.1\({}^{\circ}\)C per 10\({}^{\circ}\)C ambient temperature change. These results were taken without proper insulation of the control sensor._

is situated directly on the distribution manifold of the cooling unit and is read out by the PID which controls the temperature of the cooling water via an electrical resistance heater. As this sensor is only connected to the controller it cannot be read out by the PVSS application. The front part of the sensor sticks directly inside the metal manifold and the rear part of its tube was exposed to the ambient air. As there was no insulation foreseen for this sensor it was very sensitive to ambient temperature changes.

After a proper insulation of the controller sensor and the surrounding manifold, new data was taken in January 2002. The result is shown in figure 7. A significant reduction of the influence of the ambient temperature could be obtained. The reduced dependence of the cooling water temperature on the ambient temperature after the improved insulation in January was

\[\Delta T_{Cooling}=0.3^{\circ}C\quad per\quad\Delta 10^{\circ}C_{ambient} \tag{5}\]

Figure 7: _The cooling water temperature versus the ambient for periods of several days in the four different months August, September, November 2001 and January 2002 is shown. The January data was taken after the improvement of the insulation. The influence of the ambient temperature could be reduced significantly by isolating the control sensor and the surrounding manifold._

That corresponds to a decrease of 73%. All values are summarised in table 1.

## 6 Effects of ambient temperature on non-isolated pipes

So far all the pipes used in the cooling tests were isolated to avoid any influence of the ambient temperature. In the final ATLAS detector setup there won't be enough space for isolated pipes therefore other solutions have to be found.

A favoured possibility is the so called MEPLA tube which was tested on the dependence of the ambient temperature.

### Mepla tube

The MEPLA tube (figure 8) is a product of the European company GEBERIT. It consists of three layers polyethylene-aluminium-polyethylene and combines the advantages of plastic and metal pipes. The major advantages are:

* Fast and easy installation
* No soldering, brazing, thread cutting
* Flexible
* Dimensionally stable
* Corrosion & UV resistant
* Diffusion tight

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l} Month & Cooling water change per \({}^{\circ}\)C(ambient) \\ \hline August & 0.163\({}^{\circ}\)C \\ September & 0.093\({}^{\circ}\)C \\ November & 0.113\({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \hline January (improved isolation) & 0.027\({}^{\circ}\)C \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Summary of the dependence of the cooling water temperature on the ambient temperature. With the improved isolation of the control sensor in January the influence could be minimised._* Complete range of pipes and fittings

The tube also satisfies TIS requirements. Because of those properties the tube seems to be suitable for installation in the final ATLAS detector. The only open question that remained was the influence of ambient temperature on the non-isolated MEPLA tube. This test is explained later.

The MEPLA tube was also used in the real size cooling project [3] in building 185.

### The MEPLA tube test

In the final ATLAS detector setup an ambient temperature gradient of 5\({}^{\circ}\)C is expected between the lowest and the highest module. The distance between those two modules is approximately 10 m. As all the cooling water temperatures at the entrance of the modules should be as close as possible it is important that the temperature pick up due to the 10 m of non-isolated MEPLA tube is negligible. If this temperature pick up is not sufficiently small it would result in different cooling water temperatures in different drawers and therefore also different temperatures of the electronic components which has to be avoided. To equalise the input temperatures for the modules, a system of re-heaters was under discussion. Placed at the entrance

Figure 8: _The MEPLA tube is a three layer pipe (polyethylene - aluminium - polyethylene) and combines the advantages of plastic and metal pipes. The layer structure can be seen very clearly in this picture_

of each module they could have regulated the water temperature individually. But several points made this concept doubtful, for example the limited space, the layout of the re-heaters, their control or the additional cabling.

Figure 9 gives an overview of the situation in the pit.

For the test, the piping of the cooling system in the test-beam area was modified. The isolated inlet pipe of circuit number 4 was replaced by a 10 m long non-isolated MEPLA tube. The water temperature at the beginning and the end of the tube was measured for changing ambient temperature and the results were compared with the isolated tube of circuit number 1. Any ambient effects on the cooling unit have been removed by calculating the difference between the exit and input temperature of the tube.

In figure 10 this temperature difference is shown for the isolated tube

Figure 9: _Sketch of the Tile Calorimeter in the final ATLAS setup. There will be an ambient temperature gradient between highest and lowest module of approximately 5\({}^{\circ}\)C. Despite this gradient the cooling water temperature at the entrance of the modules should be as close as possible._

versus the ambient temperature. A dependence of

\[0.01^{\circ}C/^{\circ}C(ambient) \tag{6}\]

was found and is explainable with the non-perfect isolation of the tube.

Figure 11 shows the same measurement for the MEPLA tube. As expected the slope is a little bit steeper, to be more precisely it is

\[0.04^{\circ}C/^{\circ}C(\mbox{ambient}). \tag{7}\]

Nevertheless this dependence is negligible small in our case. For the expected temperature gradient of 5\({}^{\circ}\)C in the pit it would mean less than 0.2\({}^{\circ}\)C temperature difference of the cooling water between the lowest and the highest module. This difference would cause a change of the PMT temperature of only 0.1\({}^{\circ}\)C. "Less than 0.2\({}^{\circ}\)C" because the temperature gradient of 5\({}^{\circ}\)C in the test between day and night affected the whole length of the

Figure 10: _Temperature difference between exit (T-in-Drawer) and input (T-cooling) of the isolated tube versus the ambient temperature. Building this difference removes any ambient effects on the cooling unit and makes it possible to evaluate the temperature pick up between the two points. The slope of 0.01\({}^{\circ}\)C/\({}^{\circ}\)C(ambient) can be explained with the non-perfect isolation of the tube._

tube whereas in the final detector setup the temperature gradient will be between the two ends of the tube.

\[0.04^{\circ}C/^{\circ}C(\mbox{ambient})\;\;\&\;\;5^{\circ}C\;\mbox{gradient} \Rightarrow 0.2^{\circ}C \tag{8}\]

#### 6.2.1 Calculations

Calculations regarding the heat transfer for a MEPLA tube have also been performed. As boundary conditions a temperature difference of \(5^{\circ}\)C was used and the manufacturer specifications for the tube were taken. All the following formulas and used numbers are collected in [4]. First of all it was important to decide whether the flow was laminar or turbulent. In turbulent flow the heat absorption of the cooling liquid is much higher than in laminar flow because the liquid is constantly mixing. Warm liquid is transported

Figure 11: _Temperature difference between exit (T-in-Drawer) and input (T-cooling) of the MEPLA tube versus the ambient temperature. As expected the influence of ambient temperature is slightly higher than for the isolated tube. Nevertheless the influence of 0.04\({}^{\circ}\)C/\({}^{\circ}\)C(ambient) is absolutely negligible in our case._

from the tube walls to the centre and cold liquid is transported from the centre to the tube walls. In laminar flow there is much less mixing of the liquid and therefore less heat can be transferred from the walls of the tube to the liquid. The two modes, laminar and turbulent are shown in figure 12. To distinguish the two modes the Reynolds-number (Re) is computed. It depends on the density (\(\rho\)), the velocity (u), the tube diameter (D) and the viscosity (\(\mu\)). For the MEPLA tube and water at a temperature of 18\({}^{\circ}\)C it gives

\[Re=\frac{\rho*u*D}{\mu}\simeq 1900 \tag{9}\]

Since the boundary value between laminar and turbulent is around Re = 2300 we are still in laminar flow.

To calculate the water temperature at the end of the 10 m MEPLA tube, the whole length is divided into n segments, each \(\Delta\)x m long, as it can be seen in figure 13. Then a recursive formula is used to calculate the

Figure 12: _Two general flow modes of liquids and gases are shown. The Reynolds-number can be used to identify the flow regime the system is in._

Figure 13: _To compute the water temperature at the end of the MEPLA tube, it is divided into n small segments. Using the recursive formula 12 it is possible to calculate the temperature of each piece._

actual temperature of each piece until the last segment is computed. This procedure is very similar to a finite element calculation and can be easily carried out using a spread sheet program.

We start with the basic formula of calorimetry which gives an expression for the absorbed power (Q [W])

\[Q=\dot{m}*C*(T^{n+1}-T^{n}) \tag{10}\]

(\(\dot{m}\)...mass flow [kg/s], C...specific heat capacity [J/(kg*K)], \(T^{n}\)...water temperature of the actual segment \(T^{n+1}\)...water temperature of the successive segment) Transforming the equation and substituting Q with help of Newton's law for external heat transfer

\[Q=\frac{T_{ambient}-T^{n}}{R} \tag{11}\]

we get

\[T^{n+1}=\frac{T_{ambient}-T^{n}}{R*\dot{m}*C}+T^{n} \tag{12}\]

(R... thermal resistance [K/W]) Formula 12 is the desired recursive formula which can be used to compute the water temperature in the end of the 10 m MEPLA tube. R, the thermal resistance, consists of three terms as shown in formula 13.

\[R=\frac{1}{h_{i}*\pi*\Delta x*D_{i}}+\frac{\ln\frac{r_{o}}{r_{i}}}{2*\pi* \Delta x*K_{M}}+\frac{1}{h_{o}*\pi*\Delta x*D_{o}} \tag{13}\]

(\(h_{i}\)...inner heat-transfer coefficient, \(\Delta\)x...lenght of segment, \(D_{i}\)...inner diameter, \(r_{i}\)...inner radius, \(r_{o}\)...outer radius, \(K_{M}\)...heat conductivity of MEPLA tube, \(h_{o}\)...outer heat-transfer coefficient, \(D_{o}\)...outer diameter)

The first term represents the thermal resistance between the cooling water and the inner wall of the tube, the second term describes the resistance of the tube itself and the third term represents the transition from the outer tube wall to the surrounding air. The heat conductivity for the MEPLA tube is given by the producer (0.43 [W/(m*K)]. The heat-transfer coefficient, h, has to be calculated according to the environmental conditions. In our case a \(h_{i}\) of 208 W/(\(m^{2}\)*K) and a \(h_{o}\) of 4.7 W/(\(m^{2}\)*K) was found.

After inserting all the values in formula 12 and computing the value for the last segment of the 10 m MEPLA tube, we found the value of

\[T_{10m}=18.16^{\circ}C \tag{14}\]Finally the result of the calculation can be compared with the performed measurement. In the calculations a difference between the cooling water temperature and the ambient temperature of 5\({}^{\circ}\)C was assumed. For this assumption the measurement result 7 gives an increase of 0.2\({}^{\circ}\)C of the cooling water temperature and therefore an absolute value of 18.2\({}^{\circ}\)C. Obviously the measurement is in very good agreement with the calculation.

### Conclusion

The tests showed that using the MEPLA tubes the temperature pick up of 0.04\({}^{\circ}\)C/\({}^{\circ}\)C\({}_{ambient}\) per 10 m pipe is negligible for the expected temperature gradient in the final ATLAS detector. Based on this results the idea of installing re-heaters for the different sections of the Tilecal detector to provide equal temperatures was abandoned by the collaboration. In addition samples of the MEPLA tube were given to the TIS division and passed the safety requirements (fire, radiation, etc.).

## 7 Total dissipated power of the final superdrawers

The two main sources of heat production in the Tilecal modules are the electronics of the superdrawer and the low voltage power supply in the fingers. As it can be seen in figure 14 they both build a unit from the cooling point of view and are fed by one cooling channel which delivers cooling water in series first to the superdrawer and then to the finger. As already mentioned the cooling system was designed to extract a total of 300 W per cooling channel and to keep a \(\Delta\) T between input and outlet of the module of 2\({}^{\circ}\)C. 200 W are expected to be dissipated by the electronics in the superdrawer and 100 W by the low voltage power supply in the finger. The 256 superdrawers give an overall power dissipation of 77 kW which has to be extracted by the Tilecal cooling system.

The cooling unit had to be designed before the final superdrawers and low voltage power supplies were constructed and therefore the design was based on theoretical values and measurements of electronic prototypes. This circumstance made it necessary to measure the power dissipation of the final components used for the production in order to verify or to disprove the current cooling system design.

Hence a dedicated measurement of the consumed power of the electronics in the superdrawers has been performed. Since the final low voltage power supplies for the fingers are not yet available, the different components in a superdrawer are powered by external power supplies each providing a different voltage according to the powered component. The voltage and the current were measured with an external multimeter and the consumed power was calculated with Joule's law:

\[P=I*V \tag{15}\]

P... power [W], I... current [A], V... voltage [V]

The amount of electronics in the extended barrel and the barrel superdrawers are different and consequently they have a different power dissipation. Consequently both types of superdrawers had to be measured. In total two extended barrel and three barrel module superdrawers were checked. The results are collected in table 2.

The measured values for both types of superdrawers are within the design values of the cooling unit (200 W). But due to the effects of aging and radiation damage the electronics are expected to increase their dissipated heat with time. Therefore a safety factor of 1.5 was introduced for the total consumed power.

Even with this factor the cooling works sufficiently well to maintain the desired \(\Delta\)T of 2\({}^{\circ}\)C for the superdrawer.

Applying the safety factor for the extended barrel modules we get a average total power dissipation of 198 W which is still within the assump

Figure 14: _The cooling for the superdrawer and the LV power supply inside the finger. The cold water first enters the superdrawer and then the finger. The \(\Delta\) T is measured between inlet and outlet of the module. The design values for the cooling station are also given: 200 W for the superdrawer and 100 W for the LV power supply._

tions for the design. For the barrel module we get a power dissipation of 174*1.5 = 273 W which is above the design value of 200 W.

Nevertheless the \(\Delta\)T below 2\({}^{\circ}\)C will still be maintained for the superdrawer. In the LV power supply, which is not sensitive to temperature, it will be higher, probably at 3\({}^{\circ}\)C.

## 8 Efficiency of the cooling system

### Flow test

In April 2002 a flow test has been carried out in building 185 to determine the amount of heat that is extracted by the cooling system. During the test the water flow was varied from 20 - 82 l/h and the \(\Delta\) T between input and outlet of the superdrawer was measured. With those values it was possible to calculate the extracted heat per second.

#### 8.1.1 Scope of the flow test

The flow test was essential to understand if the current conception of the system is sufficient to fulfil its future tasks.

In order to be able to calculate the extracted heat the flow and the \(\Delta\) T between inlet and outlet of the module (see 14) had to be measured and then used in the formula [5]

\[Q=c*m*\Delta T \tag{16}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c}  & measured value & with safety factor 1.5 \\ \hline Ext.Bar. - IFA 38 & 129 W & 194 W \\ Ext.Bar. - ANL 8 & 135 W & 202 W \\ \hline Average & 132 W & 198 W \\ \hline \hline Barrel - JINR 18 & 166 W & 249 W \\ Barrel - JINR 34 & 173 W & 260 W \\ Barrel - M0- & 182 W & 273 W \\ \hline Average & 174 W & 261 W \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: _The measured values for the total consumed power (without and with a safety factor of 1.5) for two extended barrel superdrawers and three barrel superdrawers are presented. The average consumed power for both types of superdrawers are also given._Q... absorbed heat [J/s = W], c... specific heat capacity [4190 J/(kg*K)], m... mass flow [kg/s]

\(\Delta\) T... temperature difference between input/outlet of the module (\({}^{\circ}\)C)

#### 8.1.2 Measurement of the flow

For the measurement of the flow a commercial plastic flowmeter was used. It works based on the suspended float principle where a conical plastic tube with a scale is placed in vertical position. The water flow, coming upwards, raises a little floater placed inside the tube and the flow can be read off the scale.

The accuracy of the flow measurement was better than \(\pm\)1 l/h. At lower flow rates, more precisely at rates below 20 l/h, the stability of the whole circuit is not very good and the flow tends to start to vary with time. Therefore the error of the measurements at low flow rates is bigger than at higher rates.

#### 8.1.3 Measurement of the \(\Delta\) T

The temperature difference between the outlet and the inlet of the superdrawer was measured with two NTC sensors. The sensors were in direct contact with the cooling water and were well isolated with insulation tape to minimise effects of the ambient temperature.

The data was collected and archived by PVSS like in the testbeam area.

#### 8.1.4 Procedure

During the test the flow was changed successively from the highest possible flow of 82 l/h to 10 l/h. Meanwhile the temperatures of the cooling water at the input and the outlet of the module were measured to be able to compute the extracted heat. To give the system enough time to stabilise, the test was carried out over a few days and a minimum stabilisation time of 4 hours was applied. Throughout the test all the electronics in the superdrawer were powered with their nominal voltage, except the high voltage (HV) supply for the PMTs. The HV could not be used because the light tightness of the modules was not assured since the cover of the modules was partially removed due to reparation work.

To verify that no significant heat dissipation is coming from the HV, testbeam data was checked. The result is presented in figure 15. It can be seen that there is no increase of the \(\Delta\)T between input and outlet of the module, when the HV is switched off. Therefore its heat dissipation can be neglected.

### Results and comparison with previous flow tests

The results of the Flow Test performed in April 2002 are presented in figure 16. They substantially validated the two old flow tests from September 2001 done for only three different fluxes. This can be seen in figure 16 where the symbols of the test in 2001 fit very good together with the newly observed values. The graph shows a plateau at a flow of about 60 l/h. Therefore the previous conclusions regarding the flow in [1] can be confirmed and extended to the final proposition that the flow should not be lower than 60 l/h.

The maximum heat that can be extracted per second with the existing cooling system lies around 92 W for a flow of 60 l/h. Taking into account that the total consumed power by this superdrawer was 129 W it gives a cooling efficiency of 71%. Obviously 37 W are absorbed by the iron mass and have to be extracted by the air condition system of the pit.

It is a crucial point to note that this test was carried out with an extended barrel module which dissipates less heat than a barrel module because it has less electronics inside. Additionally the change of \(\Delta\)T is shown with respect

Figure 15: _The \(\Delta\)T between inlet and outlet of the module (see figure 14) is shown versus time. At 11:17 the High Voltage was switched off. Since no change of the \(\Delta\)T is observable, the heat dissipation of the HV can be neglected._

Figure 16: _Three flow tests with different modules were carried out. The total extracted heat per second versus different flow values is shown. At a flow of 60 l/h a plateau is reached and the maximum extracted power lies between 90 and 100 W. The results from all the three tests coincide very well and show that the minimum flow applied should be 60 l/h. Note that extended barrel modules were tested which dissipate less power than barrel modules._

to different flows in figure 17.

### Conclusion

It is impossible to extract all the dissipated heat with the cooling system because the superdrawers are not isolated from the surrounding iron mass. And since iron has a very good heat conductivity a significant loss of heat can be expected. This consideration was verified by the flow test.

The cooling system showed an efficiency of 71%. The residual heat is lost trough the iron mass to the surrounding air. This has to be implemented in the conception of the air flow system in the ATLAS pit, in particular for the ATLAS muon spectrometer that is located very close to the Tile superdrawers. In a meeting between Tilecal and the ATLAS Cooling Coordination this problem was presented and currently design studies are going on to implement a dedicated cooling system for the muon chambers which are very close to the Tilecal either using air flow or liquid cooling. Including the safety factor a heat flux of 18 kW can be expected through the outer envelop of the Calorimeter.

Figure 17: _The \(\Delta\,T\) is shown versus different flows. For the PMTs in the superdrawer it is important not to exceed the \(\Delta\,T\) above 2\({}^{\circ}\)C because they are sensitive to temperature. The current design of the cooling unit guarantees that even when a safety factor of 1.5 is applied due to aging and radiation effects of the electronics._

The conclusion of a high cooling efficiency at a flow of 60 l/h was confirmed since a plateau is reached at this flow rate. However 60 l/h should be seen as the minimal required flow. Higher flows like 70 or 80 l/h give a similar or slightly better cooling efficiency but are not necessarily needed.

## 9 Temperature development inside the modules without cooling

During the shutdown periods of ATLAS maintenance work on the detector components can be performed. In order to be able to access the barrel part of the detector, the extended barrels will be moved several meters. This movement also has implications on the cooling system since the cooling station is fix installed at the cavern floor and the piping is done with rigid tubes. Therefore it had to be studied if the cooling has to be reconnected after the movement of the extended barrels.

### Possible maintenance scenarios for Tilecal

During shutdown periods several tests are envisaged. Two scenarios can be considered:

1. Checks of the electronics and the readout system will be performed but no other measurements that would require normal operating conditions.
2. Additionally to the checks of the electronics and readout, calibration runs or other precision measurements will be carried out. Normal operational conditions and therefore also cooling is required.

In the second case the cooling has to stay connected or has to be reconnected after the movement of the extended barrels. The implementation has to be considered in the final cooling system design. Possibilities would be flexible tubes that stay connected or are reconnected after movement. Or fix installed tubes for both positions of the extended barrels, closed and opened, that have to be disconnected before and reconnected after the movement.

In the first scenario it would be sufficient if the electronics and the readout chain stay operational, even if the temperatures are higher than nominal. Then the cooling can stay disconnected if the temperatures in the electronics do not exceed 50\({}^{\circ}\)C. To confirm this, dedicated tests have been performed with the cooling unit switched off.

### Maximum temperatures inside superdrawers without cooling

Before certification the electronic boards undergo a burn-out test where they are exposed to a heat of 60\({}^{\circ}\)C for one week. Only then they are installed on the superdrawer. The temperature limit for good operation of the electronics was defined at around 45\({}^{\circ}\)C [6]. Thus a measurement was carried out to determine the maximum temperatures that are reached inside a superdrawer without cooling.

After the June 2002 calibration period this test was carried out with in total six superdrawers. The cooling had been in normal operational mode during the last few days and all the temperatures inside and outside the modules were nominal. At a certain point the cooling for all six modules was stopped and the increase of temperature inside the superdrawers was monitored. After 4 h 16 m the cooling was turned on again. The measurement for the extended barrel IFA 59 can be seen in figure 18, which is representative for all the other modules.

When the cooling was stopped the temperature of all seven temperature sensors placed inside the superdrawer began to rise. The shape of the curve could be fit by the following expression:

\[T_{electronics}=A-B*exp(-\frac{x}{C}) \tag{17}\]

The factor A represents the temperature after an infinite amount of time, factor B gives the difference between the temperature with cooling and without cooling and the factor C represents the time constant for the gradient of the curve.

With the fit it was possible to estimate the final temperatures inside the superdrawer. The results are summarised in table 3. It can be seen that after 4 hours the maximum temperatures are already almost reached. The major temperature rise takes place in the first 2 to 3 hours. On the other hand it takes very long until a stable maximum temperature is reached.

Taking these results into account we can conclude that it is possible to operate the electronics for several hours without the cooling because critical temperatures of above 45\({}^{\circ}\)C are not reached. Nevertheless a massive temperature increase has to be accounted for. Hence the read out signal cannot be taken as calibrated measurement.

\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c} in [\({}^{\circ}\)C] & t = 0 h & t = 4:16 h & t = infinity \\ \hline Int-Opto & 35.9 & 42.7 & 43.9 \\ Ext-Opto & 35.6 & 41.3 & 42.2 \\ Micro & 31.8 & 37.4 & 38 \\ Int-Drawer & 19.6 & 36.3 & 38 \\ Ext-Drawer & 19.1 & 34.1 & 34.9 \\ PMT 22 & 22.4 & 37.1 & 39.1 \\ Interface & 23.9 & 32.7 & 34 \\ \end{tabular}
