## 1 Introduction

Vector boson scattering (VBS) processes of two massive vector bosons \(V=W\), \(Z\) provide a key opportunity to study the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) mechanism, as well as to probe for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) [1; 2]. It is still unknown whether the discovered Higgs boson [3; 4] preserves unitarity of the longitudinal \(VV\) scattering amplitude at all energies, or if other new physics processes are involved [5; 6; 7; 8; 9]. In the VBS topology, two incoming quarks radiate bosons which interact, yielding a final state of two jets from the outgoing quarks, and two massive bosons which decay into fermions. This final state can be the result of \(VVjj\) electroweak (EW) production with and without a scattering topology, or of processes involving the strong interaction, shown in the Feynman diagrams in Figures 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

With the largest cross-section ratio of electroweak to strong production [10; 11],

The lines are labeled by quarks (\(q\)), vector bosons (\(V\)), and fermions (\(f\)). Particles with different indices may or may not have the same flavour.

plus two jets (\(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\)) provide one of the best opportunities to measure the scattering of two vector bosons. The \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) VBS processes (Figure 1) include the contributions from triple gauge vertices in the t-channel, quartic gauge vertices, and the \(t\)-channel Higgs-mediated diagram. The non-VBS EW processes with the same final state (Figure 2) also contribute to the signal, but can be suppressed through kinematic selections during the analysis. Interactions involving at least one gluon (\(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) QCD) are considered as background (Figure 3). ATLAS and CMS reported evidence for the EW production of \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) at 8 TeV with significances of 3.6 \(\sigma\) and 2.0 \(\sigma\), respectively [12, 13, 14], and CMS has observed this process at 13 TeV with a significance of 5.5 \(\sigma\)[15]. The study of this process is an important task that will continue throughout the High Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) physics program.

The ATLAS detector [16, 17] is a multi-purpose particle detector with a cylindrical geometry.1 It consists of layers of inner tracking detectors surrounded by a superconducting solenoid, calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer, and will need several upgrades to cope with the expected higher luminosity at the HL-LHC and its associated high pileup and intense radiation environment. The primary motivation for the upgrade design studies is to maximise the potential of the experiment for searches and measurements despite these harsh conditions. A new inner tracking system, extending the tracking region from \(|\eta|\leq 2.7\) up to \(|\eta|\leq 4.0\), will provide the ability to reconstruct forward charged particle tracks, which can be matched to calorimeter clusters for forward electron reconstruction, or associated to forward jets. The inner tracker extension also enables muon identification at high pseudorapidities if additional detectors (such as micro-pattern gaseous or silicon pixel detectors) are installed between the endcap calorimeters and the New Small Wheel [18] in the region \(2.7<|\eta|\leq 4.0\). Despite being in an area without magnetic field, such detectors would increase the muon spectrometer acceptance and could be used to identify (tag) inner detector tracks in the forward region as muons, while relying entirely on the inner tracker for the momentum measurement.

Footnote 1: The ATLAS experiment uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal \(pp\) interaction point at the centre of the detector. The positive \(x\)-axis is defined by the direction from the interaction point towards the centre of the LHC ring, with the positive \(y\)-axis pointing upwards, while the beam direction is along the \(z\)-axis. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r\), \(\phi\) ) are used in the transverse (\(x\), \(y\)) plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam direction. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) from the \(z\)-axis as \(\eta=-\ln[\tan(\theta/2)]\). The distance in \(\eta\)â€“\(\phi\) space between two objects is defined as \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\). Transverse energy is computed as \(E_{\rm T}=E\cdot\sin\theta\).

In this note we study the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) EW production in the context of these planned upgrades, presenting in detail the results shown briefly in the Inner Tracker and Muon Technical Design Reports [19, 20]. We present the studies in terms of the expected gain to the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) EW measurement when comparing the non-upgraded scenario with pseudorapidity range of \(|\eta|\leq 2.7\), to the upgraded detector, where the extended inner tracking system and forward muon tagging detector improve our identification ability for jets, electrons, and muons up to \(|\eta|\leq 4.0\). These two scenarios are hereafter referred to as without and with forward tracking, respectively.

## 2 Monte Carlo samples

Monte Carlo (MC) generators are used to model signal and background processes at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=\)14 TeV, with the number of events scaled to an integrated luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}\)=3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) as expected for the full HL-LHC physics program. The signal (VBS and non-VBS EW) and background (QCD) production of \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) events are simulated using Madgraph5_aMC@NLO[21] interfaced with PYTHIA v8[22] for parton showering, hadronisation and underlying event modelling. The dominant background process is \(WZ\)+jets production where both bosons decay leptonically and one lepton fails identification or falls outside of the detector acceptance, contributing about 40%, 50%, and 70% of the total background in the \(ee\), \(e\mu\), and \(\mu\mu\) channels respectively. The percentages quoted are based on the 8 TeV background composition which had a lepton pseudorapidity region of \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\); a dependence on the detector configurations studied here is expected. This process is simulated using SHERPA v2.2.0[23, 24, 25, 26] with next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in the strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{s}\) for up to one associated parton, and leading order (LO) accuracy for two and three associated partons in the final state. Both QCD and EW production of \(WZ\) processes are included in the \(WZ\) background estimation. Additional proton-proton interactions (pileup) are generated with PYTHIA v8 with the AU2 set of tuned parameters [27] and an average of 200 interactions per bunch crossing, and added event-by-event to the simulated samples.

The remaining background processes are not simulated for this study but rather estimated from the background composition of the 8 TeV \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) analysis [12]. Other processes with two prompt leptons with the same electric charge in the final state include the \(t\bar{t}V\) process, \(ZZ\)+jets production, and multiple parton interactions. These other processes contribute only a few percent to the total background. The non-prompt-lepton background, from processes with one or two jets misreconstructed as leptons or leptons from hadron decays (including \(b\)- and \(c\)-hadron decays), such as \(W\)+jets and top quark production, contributes 10-20% to the total background depending on the channel. Finally, backgrounds from processes with two prompt leptons of opposite electric charge where one lepton's charge is misidentified, and \(W+\gamma\) production where the photon is misreconstructed as an electron, contribute significantly in channels with electrons (at the level of 20-40%). The upgraded inner detector is expected to have less material than the current tracker, and though this background is difficult to predict, this may result in a smaller contribution from these events.

For estimating the total background contribution, the final event yields from the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) QCD and \(WZ\) backgrounds are summed, and the result is scaled to account for the non-simulated background contributions. The scale factors are derived from the relative background composition observed in the 8 TeV analysis2, calculated for the individual channels (2.2, 1.2, and 1.8 for the \(ee\), \(\mu\mu\), and \(e\mu\mu e\) channels, respectively). For all channels combined the scale factor is 1.7.

Footnote 2: The background cross sections in the signal region scale similarly between 8 and 14 TeV, so we consider this a reasonable method for estimating the total background for this analysis.

## 3 Object and Event Selection

The analysis proceeds on particle-level objects, and detector effects are estimated using smearing functions [28] derived from a full simulation of the ATLAS detector based on GEANT4 [29, 30], with the exception of pileup events which are fully simulated. Lepton trigger and identification efficiencies are derived as a function of \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and used to estimate the likelihood of a given lepton passing eitherthe trigger or identification requirement, respectively.3 Muon transverse momentum and electron energy resolutions are also parameterised as a function of \(\eta\) and either the transverse momentum (for muons) or transverse energy (for electrons). The missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) is defined at particle level as the transverse component of the vectorial sum of the final-state neutrino momenta. The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution is parameterised as a function of the overall event activity. Final-state particles with lifetime greater than 30 ps are clustered into jets (denoted as particle-level jets) using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [31] with radius parameter \(R=0.4\). Final-state muons and neutrinos are not included in the truth jet clustering. To avoid double-counting jets associated with electrons, an overlap requirement is applied to exclude jets within a cone of \(\Delta R_{e,j}<0.2\) to any electron with transverse energy \(>7\) GeV. The truth jet momentum is smeared as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\).

Footnote 3: The muon New Small Wheel Phase 1 upgrade will have extended the muon trigger to \(|\eta|\leq 2.7\).

The experimental signature of the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) scattering process consists of two leptons (electrons or muons) with the same electric charge, two jets well-separated in rapidity, and moderate \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). Events are preselected by either a single-muon or single-electron trigger requiring transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) and \(25\) GeV, respectively. Furthermore, electrons and muons with transverse momenta \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>7\) and \(6\) GeV, respectively, are preselected. In the case of no forward tracking or muon tagging, the leptons are restricted to \(|\eta|\leq 2.7\). For the case where forward tracking is available, we consider the situation where only electron reconstruction is available to \(|\eta|\leq 4.0\), as well as including the forward muon tagger, allowing both electron and muon reconstruction for \(|\eta|\leq 4.0\).

Jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<4.5\) are considered for the analysis, and a selection requirement on all jets with transverse momenta below 100 GeV is applied in order to distinguish between jets resulting from the hard scatter interaction and jets from the accompanying soft interactions (pileup jets). This jet vertex requirement (also known as "track confirmation") is based on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction of the jet tracks originating from the hard scattering vertex. The probability to misidentify a pileup jet as resulting from the hard scattering process is assumed to be 2%, with a resulting signal selection efficiency of 86% for \(|\eta|<1.5\) and 80% for \(|\eta|>2.9\)[19]. Jets either pass or fail this requirement, which is applied over an \(\eta\) region related to the tracking scenario: for jets up to \(|\eta|\leq 3.8\) with forward tracking available, and for jets up to \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\) without forward tracking. To reduce the significant contamination from pileup jets, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold is increased from 30 to 70 GeV for jets outside the region where the vertex requirement is applied. The value of 70 GeV was chosen based on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) distributions of the fully-simulated pileup jets in the events. Jets passing the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold and vertex requirements are preselected, and the two highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets are defined as the leading and sub-leading _tag jets_ in the event.

The extended tracker and forward muon tagger therefore affects the selection of the leading and sub-leading jets and leptons, and their effect on the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) measurement is compared in four scenarios, summarised in Table 1.

Once the jets and leptons have been selected, the same event selection criteria are applied for each of the four scenarios, shown in Table 2. The event selection follows that used in the 8 TeV analysis, requiring two well-separated leptons of the same electric charge, and with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV. A minimum requirement on the dilepton mass reduces the contamination from low-mass Drell-Yan processes, with an additional restriction excluding the \(Z\) mass in the di-electron channel where the likelihood of charge misidentification is higher. A requirement on \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) further reduces the background from charge misidentified events. At least two jets that do not overlap with the signal leptons are selected, with the additional requirements that they are well-separated in rapidity and have a large invariant mass. A veto on additional preselected leptons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>7(6)\) GeV for electrons (muons) significantly reduces background from \(WZ\) events.

Finally, the requirement on the lepton centrality4\(\zeta\), a quantity based on the kinematic signature of the leptons and jets, is imposed to enhance the purity of the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) electroweak signal.

Footnote 4: \(\zeta=\min[\min(\eta_{\ell 1},\eta_{\ell 2})-\min(\eta_{jj1},\eta_{j2}),\max( \eta_{jj1},\eta_{j2})-\max(\eta_{\ell 1},\eta_{\ell 2})]\)

## 4 Results

The total number of signal (\(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) EW) and background events expected after the full event selection for an integrated luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}\)=3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is shown in Table 3, for all channels combined. The values shown in the "Total background" column are obtained by multiplying the summed \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) (QCD) and \(WZ\) backgrounds by the scale factor discussed in Section 2. A discussion on the results observed in the table follows later in the text.

The \(\eta\) distributions for the leading and sub-leading jets after the full event selection are shown in Figure 4 for the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) signal and backgrounds. The solid filled histograms show the contribution when the

selected jet originates from the hard scatter, while the hashed fills show the contributions from pileup jets. A step in the signal sample in the \(|\eta|>2.5\) and 3.8 regions (for the scenarios without and with forward tracking, respectively) is noticeable in the sub-leading jet distributions, showing the truncation due to the raised \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold for jets in these regions.

Assuming that the number of signal events follows a Poissonian distribution and taking into account an estimated systematic uncertainty on the background5 of \(\sigma_{B}\) = 15%, the signal significance \(Z_{\sigma}\) is calculated from the number of estimated signal and background events, indicated by \(N_{\mathrm{sig}}\) and \(N_{\mathrm{bkg}}\), respectively [32]:

Footnote 5: The systematic uncertainty in the 8 TeV result was around 20% [13]. With the much larger integrated luminosity and a sophisticated understanding of the detector performance and backgrounds at the HL-LHC, we expect a 15% systematic uncertainty value to be a reasonable estimate.

\[Z_{\sigma}=\sqrt{2\Bigg{[}\Big{(}N_{\mathrm{sig}}+N_{\mathrm{bkg}}\Big{)}\text {log}\frac{N_{\mathrm{sig}}+N_{\mathrm{bkg}}}{B_{0}}+B_{0}-N_{\mathrm{sig}}- N_{\mathrm{bkg}}\Bigg{]}+\frac{\Big{(}N_{\mathrm{bkg}}-B_{0}\Big{)}^{2}}{ \sigma_{B}^{2}}} \tag{1}\]

where \(B_{0}=\frac{1}{2}\bigg{(}N_{\mathrm{bkg}}-\sigma_{B}^{2}+\sqrt{\Big{(}N_{ \mathrm{bkg}}-\sigma_{B}^{2}\Big{)}^{2}+4\Big{(}N_{\mathrm{sig}}+N_{\mathrm{ bkg}}\Big{)}\sigma_{B}^{2}}\ \bigg{)}\).

The estimated precision on the signal strength measurement, \(\frac{\Delta\mu}{\mu}\), is calculated as

\[\frac{\Delta\mu}{\mu}=\frac{\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{sig}}+N_{\mathrm{bkg}}+\sum_{i=0 }^{\mathrm{bkg}}\Big{(}N_{i}\sigma_{i}\Big{)}^{2}}}{N_{\mathrm{sig}}} \tag{2}\]

where the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) QCD-mediated background, the \(WZ\) background, and the other combined backgrounds are taken into account separately in the summation, with the estimated systematic uncertainties \(\sigma_{i}\) of 15%. Uncertainties related to the limited number of MC events are neglected, and no theoretical uncertainty is added. The estimated systematic uncertainty used here is independent of the detector configuration; improvements to the uncertainties on specific variables owing to the forward detector extensions have been neglected. The significance and precision are calculated separately for the four channels \(ee\), \(\mu\mu\), \(e\mu\), and \(\mu e\) (depending on the leading and sub-leading lepton flavour) with the total background calculated using the respective scale factor for each channel, and combined quadratically as shown in Tables 4 and 5. While the significance and precision of the measurement improves when comparing the scenario with

The total background yield is obtained by multiplying the summed \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) (QCD) and \(WZ\) backgrounds by the scale factor of 1.7 discussed in Section 2.

full forward tracking to that without forward tracking, this is not the case for the intermediate scenarios studied. However, it should be noted that the selection criteria are not reoptimised for each detector configuration, and it is expected that the significance should improve in a more complex analysis with separate event categorisation.

The addition of forward tracking and a forward muon tagger provides two advantages: the ability to tag

and reject pileup jets in the forward region, and the possibility to reconstruct forward leptons, both of which have an effect on the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) EW signal measurement. The latter also affects the ability to reject the \(WZ\) background, with more coverage for the lepton veto. The changes in the signal and background yields and the effect on the significance and precision are summarised in Table 6. In the first row we consider solely the effect of extending the range across which the jet vertex requirement is applied. The second row shows the result of extending the range for all leptons up to \(\eta<4.0\) (assuming the extended range for the jet vertex requirement in both cases). Finally, the overall effect of the combination of the two is also shown. Improvements to the systematic uncertainties on specific variables owing to the forward detector extensions have been neglected.

Footnote 5: The muon reconstruction efficiency is almost a factor of two higher than the electron reconstruction efficiency.

Without forward tracking the increased jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold reduces the number of pileup jets selected, but also reduces the number of signal events passing the event selection criteria. With forward tracking, however, the ability to reject forward pileup jets using the jet vertex requirement allows the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold to remain at 30 GeV up to \(\eta\leq 3.8\), increasing the signal yield by 12%. This increase of the signal yield, however, comes at the cost of also increasing the total background yield, since the signatures for the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) EW, \(W^{+}W^{\pm}jj\) QCD, and \(WZ\) processes all can contain two jets originating from the hard scatter vertex. This leads to a negligible change in the overall significance and precision of the measurement from the pileup jet rejection alone.

The \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) QCD background is reduced by the dijet rapidity separation requirement, leaving the dominant background to originate from \(WZ\) (QCD and EW) events. The main reduction of the \(WZ\) background comes from the veto on additional leptons in the event (where the looser \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement on the additional leptons allows for a greater rejection efficiency). With forward tracking and a forward muon tagger, the ability to reconstruct forward leptons provides a stronger veto since the likelihood of detecting the third lepton is increased, leading to a 7.7% reduction in the background. The extended lepton reconstruction region also increases the signal acceptance, therefore leading to a significant improvement in the overall significance and precision. The rejection power of the additional lepton veto and the improvement in the signal acceptance differs between individual channels, owing to the difference in reconstruction efficiencies6 between electrons and muons [19]. A smaller effect on the veto also comes from the difference in the preselected leptons, with a threshold of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>6\) and 7 GeV for muons and electrons, respectively.

Footnote 6: \(m_{\mathrm{W}\mathrm{,T}}=\sqrt{\left(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell\ell}+E_{\mathrm{ T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\right)^{2}-\left|p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell\ell}+E_{\mathrm{ T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\right|^{2}}\), where \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell\ell}=\sqrt{\left|p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell\ell}\right|^{2}+m_ {\ell\ell}^{2}}\)

In the SM, the Higgs boson unitarises the longitudinal \(VV\) scattering amplitude completely. If, however, the SM is an effective theory of a more general one with an additional strongly-coupled sector, the unitarisation may be only partial, and new physics processes may be involved. These can introduce anomolous triple and quartic couplings (aTGCs and aQGCs), with effects that are predominantly expected at larger mass scales, and affect the distributions of various kinematic variables in the event. In the context of \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) scattering, sensitive variables are the dijet azimuthal separation \(\Delta\phi(j,j)\) and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading lepton, with the longitudinal scattering preferentially occurring in the regions of large dijet separation and low lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)[33; 34]. Figure 5 shows the expected \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) distributions of the dijet separation and leading lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), as well as the transverse mass of the \(WW\) system7, for the four scenarios studied. While extracting the expected sensitivity to measure the longitudinal component of \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) scattering is beyond the scope of this note and likely will not rely on single kinematic distributions [35], it can be seen that for the scenarios with forward tracking the signal yield is increased by more than 10%,including in the large \(\Delta\phi(j,j)\) and low lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) regions that are of particular interest for longitudinal \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) scattering.

## 5 Conclusion

The \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) channel provides a metric against which to evaluate the impact of proposed new detectors in ATLAS for the HL-LHC run. The forward tracker and muon tagger provide pileup jet rejection across a larger phase space, improved signal acceptance, and an increased background rejection owing to a stronger veto on additional leptons in the event, helping to suppress the \(WZ\) background. A forward muon tagger complements the forward tracker, also allowing muon reconstruction in the forward region, and provides a large improvement to the overall analysis owing to the dominance of the muon channels. In pseudorapidity regions without tracking, the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold needs to be increased to reduce the number of pileup jets selected from these regions, which also reduces the overall signal yield. The extended tracker plus forward muon tagger therefore increases the signal yield by 14%, whilst only increasing the
