**Combined effective field theory interpretation of \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) and \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) measurements using ATLAS 13 TeV data**

The ATLAS Collaboration

An Effective Field Theory (EFT) interpretation of the two fully leptonic \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) and \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) measurements is performed to constrain anomalous Quartic Gauge Couplings. Both measurements are based on 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. Confidence Level intervals of 95% on dimension-8 EFT operators are extracted for the individual channels and for the combination, taking into account the correlations between the two channels.

## 1 Introduction

The Standard Model Effective Field Theory [1] is a theoretical framework describing the effects of theories Beyond the Standard Model with the assumption that new-physics states appear at a mass scale \(\Lambda\) that is large in comparison to the electroweak scale. In the Effective Field Theory (EFT) approach to describe the scattering of two massive vector bosons (vector boson scattering, or VBS) the effective Lagrangian includes dimension-eight (D-8) operators that modify the VBS production cross sections via the anomalous quartic gauge couplings (aQGCs) [2]. VBS are rare Standard Model processes resulting from the interaction of two bosons radiated by the initial quarks and leading to a final state with two bosons and two jets and consisting of purely electroweak processes.The increased interest in probing all sources of aQGCs possible motivates the interpretation of measurements from a single experiment with complementary sensitivity to different operators.

In this note, an EFT interpretation of the fully leptonic \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) and \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) electroweak measurements [3; 4] is presented to constrain dimension-eight operators. Both final states can be produced either through purely electroweak processes that include QGCs or by electroweak and strong non-VBS processes that do not include QGCs. The operators are expressed using the Eboli model [2], which provides nine independent charge-conjugate and parity conserving dimension-eight effective operators affecting the quartic couplings, while not modifying the triple couplings.

The note is structured as follows, in Section 2 the data used for the measurements and a brief description of the published results for the two processes are presented. In Section 3 the EFT framework used for this analysis is described, the relevant dimension-eight operators are presented, for which observed and expected limits are extracted. A brief description of the EFT Monte Carlo (MC) production method used, as well as a description of the MC samples employed for the signal prediction are given. Section 4 describes the systematics uncertainties of the measurement and the EFT predictions. In Section 5 the statistical model is presented for each process and for their combination, finally the results are given in Section 6, followed by a summary in the last section.

## 2 Data and Input measurements

The \(W^{\pm}Zjj\)[3] and the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\)[4] measurements are the inputs for this analysis. Both measurements are using 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions collected by the ATLAS experiment [5] at the LHC during the years 2015 and 2016 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV.

For the results presented in this note the differential fiducial cross section of the sum of \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) electroweak and strong production for the transverse mass of the \(W^{\pm}Z\) system (\(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{WZ}\)) from Ref. [3] were exploited in order to extract limits on the relevant EFT coefficients. In addition, the post-fit distribution of the dilepton invariant mass \(m_{ll}\) distribution of events meeting all selection criteria for the electroweak signal and all background contributions in the signal region from Ref. [4] was used to extract limits on the relevant EFT coefficients.

## 3 Effective Lagrangian, Parametrization and EFT samples

### The Effective Lagrangian

Effective field theories that respect the \(SU(3)_{C}\otimes SU(2)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}\) gauge symmetries of the Standard Model (SM) [1] are the natural approach to extend the SM, making the EFT able to describe new, short-distance interactions. The effective Lagrangian can be written in terms of higher dimension operators and their respective Wilson coefficients as:

\[\mathcal{L}_{\text{eff}}=\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}+\sum_{i}\frac{f_{i}^{(6)}}{ \Lambda^{2}}O_{i}+\sum_{j}\frac{f_{j}^{(8)}}{\Lambda^{4}}O_{j}+... \tag{1}\]

where \(O_{i,j}\) are the \(i,j\) dimension-\(6,8\) operators respectively and involve SM fields with respective dimensionless couplings \(f_{i}^{(6)}\) and \(f_{j}^{(8)}\), while \(\Lambda\) is the energy scale of the new processes, where the new processes become relevant.

It is important to note that the energy scale \(E\) of the considered process must be \(E<\Lambda\). However, the important parameters in the expansion are the \(f\)'s and not the scale \(\Lambda\). The \(\Lambda\) and \(f\)'s refer to a specific UV complete model, so even for \(E<<\Lambda\), simple counting of powers may be misleading. That is, the contribution of dimension-6 (D-6) operators to a given process may be suppressed compared to dimension-8 (D-8), contrary to naive \(E/\Lambda\) power counting. Similarly interference terms of D-8 with SM may be subleading compared to [D-6]\({}^{2}\) terms. In the case of the two processes studied here, the D-6 operator effects are assumed to have negligible effect and the dimension-8 operators are assumed to be dominant compared to the D-6. The effect of D-6 operators in VBS processes as well as in QCD diboson production accompanied by jets is of interest on its own [6], but it is not studied in this note.

The basic blocks to construct the effective Lagrangian for a VBS process, the ones studied in this note, are genuine QGC vertices, which in the effective Lagrangian will appear in the lowest order as D-8 operators and can be classified in three groups [2]: operators that contain four covariant derivatives of the Higgs field (Scalar type \(O_{S_{0},S_{1}}\)); those that contain two Higgs covariant derivatives and two field strength tensors (Mixed -scalar and tensor- type \(O_{M_{0,1,2,3,...,7}}\)); and those with four field strength tensors (Tensor type \(O_{T_{0,1,2,3,...,9}}\)).

The first ones are of the Scalar type (\(O_{S_{0},S_{1}}\)), the second of the Mixed type (scalar and tensor) (\(O_{M_{0,1,2,3,...,7}}\)) and the third of the Tensor type (\(O_{T_{0,1,2,3,...,9}}\)). The operators that affect both measurements, i.e simultaneously modify the \(WWWW\) and the \(WWZZ\) vertices are: \(O_{S_{0},S_{1}}\), \(O_{M_{0,1,6,7}}\) and \(O_{T_{0,1,2}}\). The \(O_{M_{6}}\) has a linear correlation with \(O_{M0}\) and thus \(O_{M_{6}}\) is not explicitely studied here. Consequently, the respective coefficients we constrain from these measurements are: \(f_{S_{0},S_{1}}/\Lambda^{4}\), \(f_{M_{0,1,7}}/\Lambda^{4}\) and \(f_{T_{0,1,2}}/\Lambda^{4}\).

### Description of the MC EFT samples generated

The EFT samples used were produced with Madgraph 2.6.5 using the Eboli model [2], exploiting the amplitude decomposition. The hadronization was performed with Pythia 8.186 using the dipole-recoil scheme [7]. The signal simulation after the Pythia 8 shower effects is directly used to compare to the unfolded data in the \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) case [8]; for the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) the signal simulation is folded and then compared to the detector-level data. The folding procedure used takes the particle level dilepton invariant massand accounts for effects of the detector reconstruction using a migration matrix, efficiency, and fiducial corrections [9]. These corrections incorporate migrations between particle and detector-level distributions, detector resolution and efficiency effects. For both processes, the electroweak samples are produced using Madgraph 2.6.5. For the strong \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) contribution, the post-fit distribution of the \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{WZ}\) from Ref. [3] is used, extracted from the sample that has been produced with Sherpa 2.2.2.

#### 3.2.1 The decomposition technique

In the EFT approach, extra operators are added to the SM Lagrangian and the matrix element of a subprocess can be written in general as

\[|A_{\mathrm{SM}}+\sum_{i}c_{i}A_{i}|, \tag{2}\]

where \(A_{\mathrm{SM}}\) is the SM amplitude, corresponding to the SM cross section, and the \(A_{i}\) are the contributions of the individual D-8 operators that contribute to the Lagrangian with a coefficient \(c_{i}=\frac{f_{i}^{(\mathrm{s})}}{\Lambda^{4}}\). Consequently, the total amplitude squared at the EFT point \(i\)\(|A_{\mathrm{SM}}+\sum_{i}c_{i}A_{i}|^{2}\) can be written as

\[|A_{\mathrm{SM}}+\sum_{i}c_{i}A_{i}|^{2}=|A_{\mathrm{SM}}|^{2}+\sum_{i}c_{i}2 Re(A_{\mathrm{SM}}^{*}A_{i})+\sum_{i}c_{i}{}^{2}|A_{i}|^{2}+\sum_{ij,i\neq j}c_{i} c_{j}2Re(A_{i}A_{j}^{*}), \tag{3}\]

where \(A_{\mathrm{SM}}\) is the Standard Model amplitude, \(\sum_{i}c_{i}2Re(A_{\mathrm{SM}}^{*}A_{i})\) is the amplitude of the interference between the SM and the EFT operator (interference term), \(\sum_{i}c_{i}{}^{2}|A_{i}|^{2}\) is the pure EFT operator contribution (which will be referred to as quadratic term) and \(\sum_{ij,i\neq j}c_{i}c_{j}2Re(A_{i}A_{j}^{*})\) stands for the interference between two EFT operators (cross terms).

In Madgraph, one can generate individual samples using only one term at a time (SM, interference, quadratic or cross). To obtain events at a given value of the EFT coefficient, the respective sample is multiplied by the appropriate value (\(c_{i}\), \(|c_{i}|^{2}\), \(c_{i}c_{j}\)). The validity of the decomposition technique for each of the analysis included has been verified by comparing the full production with the sum of the decomposed samples. Throughout this note, \(\Lambda=1\) TeV is assumed. Results for alternative values of the new-physics scale, \(\Lambda^{\prime}\), can be obtained by multiplying the constraints on the D-8 coefficients by \((\Lambda/\Lambda^{\prime})^{4}\).

### The unitarization method: The clipping technique

The EFT framework is not a complete model, and the presence of nonzero aQGCs will violate tree-level unitarity at sufficiently high energy. More physical limits can be obtained by removing the EFT contribution above the unitarity limit and keeping the SM predictions for all \(VV\) invariant masses, even above the unitarity limit.

The approach followed in this note is to extract the individual lower and upper limits for the relevant coefficients of the S0, S1, M0, M1, M7, T0, T1 and T2 operators by removing the EFT contributions that exceed a maximal scale \(M_{\mathrm{cut}}\). This technique will be referred to as clipping technique and is described in Ref. [10]. The clipping is evaluated using boson kinematics at parton level (before parton shower) and applied on the invariant mass of the \(VV\) system.

Systematic Uncertainties

### Experimental Uncertainties

Both \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) and \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) measurements are subject to experimental systematic uncertainties (see Table 1), described in [3, 4], and which affect both of the measurements.

In the \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) result, the dominant experimental uncertainty sources are the unfolding uncertainty, reconstruction uncertainties related to jet reconstruction and electron and muon identification as well as the luminosity measurement and the pile-up modelling. The main background uncertainties are those on the to non-prompt background estimation and the misidentified leptons data-driven method.

In the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) result, the dominant experimental uncertainty sources arise from the calibration of the jet energy scale and resolution, the luminosity measurement, the \(b\)-tagging, the pile-up modeling, as well as from the determination of the lepton identification and isolation efficiency. The main background uncertainties are those on the non-prompt and misidentified leptons data-driven method. The folding procedure of the EFT simulation to detector level also comes with associated uncertainties that were derived by comparing folded and detector simulated samples and applying the difference as an uncertainty on the extracted EFT limits.

The correlation of systematic uncertainties between bins of the same measurement has been evaluated as part of the original measurements.

### Theory Uncertainties

Theoretical uncertainties in the modeling of signal processes play an important role. The following uncertainties were calculated for the SM processes and for the EFT simulated samples.

**PDF and \(\sigma_{S}\)** The PDF4LHC recommendations [11] were used to evaluate the uncertainties on the parton distribution functions (PDF) and strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{S}\).

The uncertainties are evaluated by reweighting events using variations of the nominal PDF set. The value of \(\alpha_{S}\) at the scale \(m_{Z}\) is evaluated to be 0.118. The effect of \(\alpha_{S}\) is evaluated by using the baseline PDF set with varied \(\alpha_{S}\) values, 0.117 and 0.119. PDF and \(\alpha_{S}\) uncertainties are combined in quadrature and the size of this uncertainty typically varies between 1-3%.

**Scale uncertainties** The signal is calculated using the transverse mass of the diboson system as dynamical scale, at leading order. The uncertainty due to missing higher order corrections of the perturbative expansion of the partonic cross section is evaluated by the independent variation of the renormalization and factorization scales, \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) by a factor of \(x=2\) or \(x=1/2\). The variations are then combined by taking an envelope of all of the uncertainties in each bin. The size of scale uncertainties vary depending on the measurements are of the order of 20-30% for the strong-mediated production of \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) and \(W^{\pm}Zjj\), and 6-10% for the electroweak mediated production.

**Parton Shower uncertainties** To account for additional uncertainties in the modelling of jets, the SM and EFT generated samples include on-the-fly weights to evaluate the impact of alternative tuning parameters of the parton shower model.

The interference between the electroweak and the strong production of the \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) channel is treated as an uncertainty. It is estimated at leading order using the Madgraph 2.6.5 generator [12], including only contributions to the squared matrix element of order one in \(\alpha_{S}\).

### Treatment of uncertainties in the combination

For the combination, several correlation schemes for the theory uncertainties were tried and the one producing the most conservative limits was chosen. The theory uncertainties in different bins of the same measurement are treated as correlated. Considering the difference in phase space between the two measurements being combined and the fact that the theory uncertainties on the SM \(WZ\) strong mediated production were not evaluated coherently between the measurements, it was chosen to treat them as uncorrelated. To give the fit model additional flexibility, the scale and parton shower uncertainties for the EFT samples are taken as uncorrelated between the measurements, leaving only the EFT PDF and \(\alpha_{S}\) uncertainties as correlated. The luminosity and pile-up modelling uncertainties are treated as fully correlated between the two measurements.

All the other experimental sources of systematics uncertainties are uncorrelated across the channels. The correlation of additional components of the jet energy scale and resolution uncertainties is not taken into account, as different schemes are used to report them. A possible correlation in the modelling of the non-prompt and misidentified lepton background is also neglected, as different estimation methods are used for the different analyses. The possible correlation of background process uncertainties in one measurement with signal uncertainties in another measurement, for example for \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) strong mediated production, which is a background in the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) measurement, is not taken into account since the difference in phase space might require a non-trivial correlation factor. The effect of different correction schemes of the theory and experimental uncertainties on the limits was found to be below 1%.

An overview of the sources of uncertainty and their correlation scheme is given in Table 1.

## 5 Statistical model

### Statistical model used for the interpretation of the \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) measurement

The probability density function used in the interpretation of the unfolded \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{WZ}\) measurement in \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) is based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The modelling of the experimental and theory uncertainties is performed by nuisance parameters constrained by Gaussian distributions that represent auxiliary measurements as well as theoretical expectations. The prediction of the analyzed distribution is subject to the set of the Wilson coefficients \(\mathbf{c}\), and is also subject to theory systematics, for example factorization and normalization scale uncertainties, which are parametrized by theory nuisance parameters.

For a given theory nuisance parameter configuration \(\mathbf{\theta}_{\text{theo syst}}^{W^{\pm}Z}=(\theta_{1},\dots,\theta_{j},\dots, \theta_{n_{\text{theo syst}}^{W^{\pm}Z}})\), where \(n_{\text{theo syst}}^{W^{\pm}Z}\) is the number of theory nuisance parameters affecting the signal predictions, the predicted fiducial cross section in a bin \(b\) of the unfolded \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{WZ}\) distribution is parametrized as

\[x_{b}^{\text{pred}}\left(\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}_{\text{theo syst}}^{W^{\pm}Z} \right)=x_{b}^{\text{SM}}(1+\Delta_{b}(\mathbf{c}))\times\prod_{j}^{n_{\text{theo syst}}^{W^{\pm}Z}}\left(1+\theta_{j}u_{b,j}\right), \tag{4}\]

where \(\Delta_{b}(\mathbf{c})\) corresponds to the fractional increase of the per-bin cross section with respect to the SM and is obtained from the individual samples that were produced with the decomposition techinque (sec. 3.2.1), and \(u_{b,j}\) is the relative size of the uncertainty \(j\) in bin \(b\).

The cross section measurement is affected by the model that is used to subtract backgrounds, to calculate detector efficiencies, and to unfold distributions (for the \(W^{\pm}Zjj\)). Uncertainties of this model are parametrized with experimental nuisance parameters \(\mathbf{\theta}_{\text{exp syst}}^{W^{\pm}Z}=(\theta_{1},\dots,\theta_{j},\dots, \theta_{n_{\text{exp syst}}^{W^{\pm}Z}})\), where \(n_{\text{exp syst}}^{W^{\pm}Z}\) is the number of experimental nuisance parameters affecting the measurement. The nominal result of each of the measurements corresponds to a model in which all nuisance parameters are set to their nominal values whereas alternative results corresponding to \(1\sigma\) variations of each of the nuisance parameters, are also available. This information is used to calculate an alternative measurement result that is a function of the nuisance parameter values:

\[x_{b}^{\text{meas}}\left(\mathbf{\theta}_{\text{exp syst}}^{W^{\pm}Z} \right)=x_{b}\times\prod_{j}^{n_{\text{exp syst}}^{W^{\pm}Z}}\left(1+\theta_{j }v_{b,j}\right), \tag{5}\]

where \(x_{b}\) is the nominal measurement result and \(v_{b,j}\) is the relative impact of the systematic variation \(j\) on the measured cross section in bin \(b\).

The likelihood is then constructed following the same procedure described for the WW measurement in [13].

### Statistical model used for the interpretation of the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) measurement

The likelihood for the interpretation of the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) signal strength measurement is based on a Poisson distribution. For each bin \(b\) of the \(m_{ll}\) distribution of the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) measurement, the likelihood associated with the observation of \(N_{b}\) signal events is modelled as a Poisson distribution.

\[L_{b}^{WW}\left(N_{b}\big{|}\mathbf{c},\mathbf{\theta}^{WW}\right)=\text{Poisson}\left(N_{ b}\big{|}\mu(\mathbf{c})S_{b}\left(\mathbf{\theta}^{WW}\right)+B_{b}\left(\mathbf{\theta}^{WW} \right)\right), \tag{6}\]

where \(B_{b}\) is the expected background yield and \(S_{b}\) the expected number of signal events while \(\mu\) is a signal strength parameter that represents the cross section times branching ratio of the process divided by the SM expectation; \(\mu\) is parametrized in terms of Wilson coefficients. Both \(B_{b}\) and \(S_{b}\) depend on the set of nuisance parameters \(\mathbf{\theta}^{WW}\) as both the expected signal and background yield are subject to uncertainties in the modelling of experimental effects and in the theoretical prediction of signal as well as background processes.

### Combined likelihood and fit

The likelihoods from the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) and \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) measurements are combined to allow a coherent EFT interpretation of both measurements. Systematic uncertainties due to identical sources are parametrized with the same nuisance parameter in both measurements so that the total number of nuisance parameters \(n_{\text{syst}}^{\text{comb}}\) is less than the sum of \(n_{\text{syst}}^{W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj}\) and \(n_{\text{syst}}^{W^{\pm}Zjj}\).

A profile likelihood ratio test statistic is constructed from the likelihood, in order to estimate the confidence intervals for a Wilson coefficient \(c_{i}\):

\[\lambda\left(c_{i}\right)=-2\log\frac{L\left(c_{i},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)}{ L\left(\hat{c_{i}},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)}. \tag{7}\]

Here \(L\left(c_{i},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)\) is the maximum of the likelihood for fixed \(c_{i}\) and \(L\left(\hat{c_{i}},\hat{\mathbf{\theta}}\right)\) the value at the absolute maximum of the likelihood. For each individual Wilson coefficient, maximum likelihood fits are performed by setting other coefficients to zero and maximizing the likelihood with respect to the nuisance parameters. In the case of two-dimensional limits, the maximum likelihood fits are performed with two free Wilson coefficients and setting other coefficients to zero. Confidence intervals are derived using Wilks' theorem [14], assuming that the profile likelihood test statistic is \(\chi^{2}\) distributed [15].

## 6 Results

The measurements performed in the \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) and \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) are used to constrain aQGCs in the Effective Field Theory framework described in Ref. [2]. Following the methodology described in Section 5, limits on the individual channels are extracted and combined. No excess of events with respect to the SM background predictions is observed. The observed and expected 95% confidence level (CL) lower and upper limits on the aQGC parameters are derived. In Figures 1, 2, 3 and 4 the individual expected and observed limits for the coefficients of the S0, S1, M0, M1, M7, T0, T1 and T2 operators using various energy cut-off values are presented, in the \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) and the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) channel respectively. The theoretical bounds imposed by the partial-wave unitarity of gauge-boson scattering are also drawn, the predictions used were derived in [16] for the minimal scenario with just one non-vanishing QGC Wilson coefficient. The unitarity bounds show the range of validity of the EFT approach, where a contribution of an effective D-8 operator will not lead to unitarity violation at high energies. In our results most of the unitarized limits obtained with the clipping method are outside the validity range and meet the unitarity bound at valuesaround 1 TeV. Nevertheless for the M0 and T0 operators in the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) channel, and for the S1 operator in both channels, no intersection was found due to the limited sensitivity of the measurements. In more realistic scenarios were more than one QGC operator contributes, the unitarity bounds obtained from the partial-wave analyses in [16] are always weaker than the ones shown in the figures for all Wilson-coefficient combinations.

Table 2 shows the individual lower and upper limits obtained without using any unitarization procedure whereas Table 3 shows the individual lower and upper limits for the same set of coefficients after applying the energy cut-off at 1 TeV for both processes. The value was chosen taking into consideration the intersection with the unitarity bound and the expected SM background. Lower clipping values were not used to avoid excluding phase-space that is accessible with data.

In order to probe the correlations between various EFT parameters limits, aQGC parameters are also derived using a two-dimensional scan. In this case, two EFT coefficients of the same family are included in the fit and the rest of the coefficients are assumed to have zero contribution. The observed resulting two-dimensional 95% CL intervals of the M0-M1, M0-M7, M1-M7, T0-T1, T1-T2 and T0-T2 obtained without using any unitarization procedure, using the individual measurements and the combination are shown in Figure 7. Two-dimensional 95% CL intervals where not obtained for the S0-S1 combination as the data in the two measurements contain insufficient information to constrain both parameters. The

exclusion contours obtained by the individual measurements exhibit different shapes, in particular for the \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) channel a flat direction in the likelihood is visible. The shapes of the exclusion contours can be explained by the different correlations between parameters in the studied measurements combined. The combination uses the complementarity of the individual exclusion contours resulting in much more stringent two-dimensional 95% CL intervals.

The constraints on the quartic operators have been derived. The numerically strongest constraints are obtained on the operators of the Tensor type T0, T1 and T2. The measurements are statistically limited. The combination with additional measurements could help to improve the constraints on all the parameters

## 7 Summary

The D-8 EFT operators are constrained in a combined analysis of the fully leptonic \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) and \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) channels. The measurements are based on the partial Run 2 dataset of 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) collected by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC at the \(\sqrt{s}=13\,\mathrm{TeV}\). The differential cross section measurement of the \(W^{\pm}Z\) invariant mass and the reconstructed dilepton invariant mass of the fully leptonic \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) were used in order to derive limits on the EFT coefficients in the individual channels and also limits on their combination. These limits represent the first limits at 13 TeV on aQGC parameters in the electroweak \(W^{\pm}Zjj\) and \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) processes, as well as the first combination of D-8 EFT operators, performed using unfolded and reconstruction-level results.

The combination improves the sensitivity to the aQGC parameters obtained on individual parameters by a maximum of 21%. The two-dimensional constraints show the complementarity of the two channels in the parameter space. Furthermore, for the individual channels, the exclusion bounds are presented by scanning multiple values of the clipping energy. It can be seen by comparing with the unitarity bounds [16] that the measurements in these final states only begin to reach reasonable regions when the clipping energy is at 1.5 TeV or further below. The combination results are presented as well for a clipping energy at 1 TeV.

Comparing the nominal unclipped exclusion intervals with the current best limits, obtained by the CMS collaboration using the \(W^{\pm}Vjj\) fully leptonic [10] and semileptonic [17] channels, it can be seen that the limits are not competitive. However, no optimization was done regarding the binning or the phase space used for this study. The individual limits can be improved by using the Full Run 2 dataset and the combination can be improved, for example, by including more channels as well as a more extensive correlation of the experimental systematic uncertainties. The analysis flow developed for this result makes it straightforward to include additional measurements in the combination in the future.
