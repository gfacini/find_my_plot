To measure the energy of the jets or the missing transverse momemtum, the detector must have enough instrumented thickness. The barrel calorimeter is the thinner part of the calorimetry; in the actual design, at rapidity around 0, the liquid argon calorimeter of the Atlas detector have more than nine instrumented absorption lengths. Using simulated jets having a rapidity near 0 in the Atlas detector, we study the lateral extension of the jets in the liquid argon calorimeter to define the correct opening angle of the cone used to measure the jet energy. For two value of this angle, we look at the fraction of energy deposited in the last three interaction lengths hadronic calorimeter.

**2. Description of the simulated setup**

In our simulation the instrumented thickness of the calorimeter is of the order of ten interaction lengths:

1. 0.06 \(\lambda\) before the cryostat (moderator)
2. 0.2 \(\lambda\) in front of the preshower (cryostat and coil)
3. 0.14 \(\lambda\) in the preshower (lead of the converter)
4. 1.49 \(\lambda\) of material in the electromagnetic calorimeter (lead and liquid argon)
5. 8.1 \(\lambda\) of material in the hadronic calorimeter (iron and liquid argon)

The total instrumented thickness is of the ordre of ten interaction lengths.

The hadronic part of the liquid argon calorimeter is divided in four samplings in the actual design. To study the distribution of the jets energy in the longitudinal samplings, the simulated hadronic calorimeter has been cut in eight samplings of approximatively one interaction length. The cells of the simulated calorimeter have a size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) of 0.02 \(\times\)0.02.

**3. Events sample**

A set of files of jets of d quark having a \(P_{t}\) of 50, 100, 200, 300, 1000 and 300 GeV/c have been simulated. (Cartridges number: 128402, 128403, 128890, 128404, 128405, 128406 Data Cards RD3S) The statistic used is the following:

1. 500 jets of 50 GeV of \(P_{t}\)
2. 500 jets of 100 GeV of \(P_{t}\)
3. 1000 jets of 200 GeV of \(P_{t}\)
4. 250 jets of 300 GeV of \(P_{t}\)
5. 200 jets of 1 TeV of \(P_{t}\)
6. 116 jets of 3 TeV of \(P_{t}\)

**4. Reconstruction of jets**

We use an algorithm very similar to the one coded in subroutine LUCELL of the PYTHIA program. The cells of the simulated calorimeter are grouped 3 by 3. The binning of the table in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) is \(0.06\times 0.06\). The algorithm looks at the cell with the highest transverse energy and adds the energy of the cells contained in a cone of half angle \(\Delta R\) where \(\Delta R\) is defined by \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) These cells are killed and the algorithm is iterated till there is no more cells of transverse energy greater than a threshold. The value of the threshold is 5 GeV and the jet is considered only its \(P_{t}\) is greater than 20 GeV/c. The coordinates of the jets axis in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) are defined by the barycenter of the cells. When two jets are closer than a \(\Delta R_{\rm min}\), the two jets are rejected. The value of the cut on \(\Delta\)R is 2. Most of these jets are due to the split of the initial parton in two jets and the preceding algorithm is too simple to reconstuct the corrected jet energy.

## 5 Lateral extension of the jets

The figures 1a, 2a, 3a and 4a present the mean value of the ratio \(E(\Delta R)/E(\Delta R=1)\) for jets of respectively 50, 200, 1000, 3000 GeV of \(P_{r}\). For the same set of data, we display on the figures 1b, 1c, 1d, 2b, 2c, 2d, 3b, 3c, 3d the distribution of \(E(\Delta R)/E(\Delta R=1)\) for three values of \(\Delta\)R = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7. The Table 1 resumes the fraction of energy contained for three values of the opening angle of the jet cone \(\Delta\)R = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 for the different set of data.

The figures 5a and 5b give the fraction of the events having respectively less than 90 and 95 % of the total energy of the jets contained in a cone of \(\Delta\)R = 0.5 and 0.7. The total energy of the jet is defined as the energy contents in a cone of half angle R = 1.

More than 95% of the total energy of the jets of \(P_{t}\) greater than 50 GeV/c is contained in a cone of half angle \(\Delta\)R = 0.5. To reconstruct the jets with the Atlas's liquid argon calorimeter, we can use cone angle of \(\Delta\)R =0.3 to identify the jets and a cone angle of \(\Delta\)R = 0.7 to measure the energy.

## 6 Effect of the depth of the calorimeter

The figures 6a, 7a, 8a and 9a present the mean value of the fraction of the total energy contained in each of the ten samplings of the simulated liquid argon calorimeter and the RMS of these distributions for jets having 200, 300, 1000, 3000 GeV/c of \(P_{r}\). For the same sets of data the figures 6b,c,d, 7b,c,d, 8b,c,d and 9b,c,d present the distribution of the fraction of the total energy contents in the first seven, height and nine samplings.

The Table 2 on page 3Table 3 on page 3, Table 4 on page 3 give respectively the mean value of the ratio of the energy deposited in the first 7, 8 or 9 sampling of the liquid argon calorimeter over the total energy for two value of the opening angle \(\Delta\)R = 0.5 and 0.7.

Table 4: Ratio E(9 samplings) over the total energyConclusion

A hadronic calorimeter of six to seven interaction lengths following the liquid argon electromagnetic calorimeter of Atlas contains 99 % of the energy deposited in the actual design of the calorimeter. It seems interesting to have a veto to identify the jets which leave more than a certain amount in the last instrumented part of the calor to sign these jets when we want only well contained events.
