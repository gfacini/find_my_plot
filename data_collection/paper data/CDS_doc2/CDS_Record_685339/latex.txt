###### Abstract

The total energy resolution measured by a multi-layers calorimeter can be optimized by applying weighting factors to the energy measured by each of the layers. The set of the optimal weights can be analytically calculated starting from the mean energies deposited in each layer and their covariance matrix. The statistical uncertainties are estimated using a numerical approach. The method is applied to a test beam data set on a production module of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter barrel, showing an improvement in the energy resolution, uniformity and scale.

## 1 Introduction

The shower energy response of a calorimeter with a longitudinal multi-layer segmentation, evaluated as a simple sum of the energies recorded by all layers, is affected by several effects which deteriorate the total energy resolution and bias the measured value of the total energy.

Some of these effects can be recovered by reconstructing the total energy \(E_{\mathrm{tot}}\) as a _weighted_ sum of the energy measurements in all the longitudinal layers:

\[E_{\mathrm{tot}}=\sum_{i}^{n}w_{i}E_{i}\]

(\(n\) being the numbers of sampling layers) where the weights \(w_{i}\)'s are chosen in order to minimize the relative energy resolution \(\sigma[E_{\mathrm{tot}}]/\langle E_{\mathrm{tot}}\rangle\).

In this note the problem is studied on the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter barrel (EMB) [1], which has three longitudinal layers (Strips, Middle, Back) and is complemented by a thin Presampler layer put in front. Referring to this setup:* The energy loss due to the amount of material in front of the EMB can be recovered by weighting the energy deposited in the Presampler (and potentially even in the Strips).
* For showers of few hundred GeV or more, the energy resolution loss due to a longitudinal leakage can be recovered by weighting the energy deposited in the Back compartment.
* Moreover, an accurate choice of the weights can in principle reduce the effects of cross-talk between the layers on the energy measurement.

In this note, an analytic solution for the optimal weights is proposed (in Section 2), together with a numerical method to estimate their statistics fluctuations (see Section 2.3). Furthermore, the technique is applied to the data taken during the exposure of the ATLAS EMB production Module 13 on a test beam (July-August 2001), the optimal weights are studied as functions of the \(\eta,\phi\) coordinates, and the improvements on the energy scale, resolution and uniformity are presented (Section 3).

## 2 Formulation of the problem, and its solutions

The _total optimized energy_, defined as

\[E_{\rm tot}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}E_{i} \tag{1}\]

(\(n\) being the numbers of sampling layers) is a function of the stochastic variables \(E_{i}\)'s, whose averages are \(\langle E_{i}\rangle=\mu_{i}\). Their RMS's and correlations are described by the covariance matrix \({\rm Cov}[E_{i},E_{j}]=C_{ij}\). These parameters can be derived from the data set with the usual formulae:

\[\mu_{i} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}E_{i}^{(k)}}{N} \tag{2}\] \[C_{ij} = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^{N}(E_{i}^{(k)}-\mu_{i})(E_{j}^{(k)}-\mu_{j})}{ N-1} \tag{3}\]

where \(N\) is the number of events collected, and the superscript \({}^{(k)}\) flags the event number.

The average and variance of \(E_{\rm tot}\) are:

\[\langle E_{\rm tot}\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{n}w_{i}\mu_{i} \tag{4}\] \[{\rm Var}[E_{\rm tot}] = \sum_{i,j}w_{i}w_{j}C_{i\,j} \tag{5}\]The goal is to find the values for the \(w_{i}\)'s such to minimize \(\sigma[E_{\text{tot}}]/\langle E_{\text{tot}}\rangle\), where \(\sigma[E_{\text{tot}}]=\sqrt{\text{Var}[E_{\text{tot}}]}\).

The minimization problem can be analytically solved in different ways. In this work we present two possible approaches, one based on matrix algebra (see section 2.1) and one variational (see section 2.2). The result, in both cases, is1

Footnote 1: A generic \(n\times n\) covariance matrix \(C\) is by definition symmetric and semi-defined positive. It can always be written as

\[C=\left(\begin{array}{cccc}C_{11}&\rho_{12}\sqrt{C_{11}C_{22}}&\cdots&\rho_{ 1m}\sqrt{C_{11}C_{nn}}\\ \rho_{1}\sqrt{C_{11}C_{22}}&C_{22}&\cdots&\rho_{m}\sqrt{C_{22}C_{nn}}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ \rho_{n1}\sqrt{C_{11}C_{nn}}&\cdots&\rho_{(n-1)n}\sqrt{C_{(n-1)(n-1)}C_{nn}}&C _{nn}\end{array}\right)\]

 where \(\rho_{ij}\) is the correlation coefficient

\[\rho_{ij}=\frac{C_{ij}}{\sqrt{C_{ii}C_{jj}}}\]

It can be shown [2] that \(C\) is defined positive (and therefore invertible) if there is no perfect linear correlation between any two of the \(n\) variables, namely if \(\rho_{ij}\neq\pm 1\). This is always the case for the energy measurements in different calorimeter compartments, due to the stochastic mechanism of shower development. In case \(\rho_{ij}=\pm 1\), \(C\) is singular.

as extracted according to equations (2),(3) from the finite data sample under exam, are affected by statistical fluctuations, that propagate into the evaluation of the weights2. An estimate of their effect is described in Section 2.3.

Footnote 2: Notice that these fluctuations are completely unrelated to the “errors” that could be obtained from an iterative minimization algorithm (e.g. MINUIT), which are due to the way the algorithm handles the function to minimize. In the case under exam, the minimum is known analytically with absolute precision, once the function is given. However, the function itself is affected by uncertainties of statistical origin (through the quantities \(C_{ij}\)’s and \(\mu_{i}\)’s), and their effect must be studied.

### Matrix algebra solution

The expression \(\sigma[E_{\mathrm{tot}}]/\langle E_{\mathrm{tot}}\rangle\) can be directly manipulated through a matricial approach. Using the notation:

* \(C=\) covariance matrix \(C_{ij}=\mathrm{Cov}[E_{i},E_{j}]\)
* \(\vec{\mu}=\) mean energies \(\mu_{i}\) vector
* \(\vec{w}=\) weights \(w_{i}\) vector
* \(\vec{w}^{T}=\) transpose of the \(\vec{w}\) vector

Figure 1: Relative energy resolution \(\sigma[E_{\mathrm{tot}}]/\langle E_{\mathrm{tot}}\rangle\) as a function of the Presampler and Back weights (3-D plot and level curves). The weights for Strips and Middle layer are constrained to 1.

one can write the total energy resolution as:

\[\frac{\sigma[E_{\mbox{\tiny tot}}]}{\langle E_{\mbox{\tiny tot}}\rangle}=\frac{ \sqrt{\vec{w}^{T}C\,\vec{w}}}{\vec{w}^{T}\vec{\mu}} \tag{8}\]

and directly perform the minimization with respect to the \(\vec{w}\) vector. The extremals of (8) are vectors \(\vec{w}\) that satisfy:

\[0=\frac{\partial}{\partial\vec{w}}\left(\frac{\sqrt{\vec{w}^{T} C\,\vec{w}}}{\vec{w}^{T}\vec{\mu}}\right) = \frac{1}{(\vec{w}^{T}\vec{\mu})^{2}}\left[\frac{(C\vec{w})(\vec{w }^{T}\vec{\mu})}{\sqrt{\vec{w}^{T}C\vec{w}}}-\vec{\mu}\sqrt{\vec{w}^{T}C\vec{ w}}\right]\] \[= \frac{[C\vec{w}\vec{w}^{T}\vec{\mu}-\vec{\mu}\vec{w}^{T}C\vec{w }]}{(\vec{w}^{T}\vec{\mu})^{2}\sqrt{\vec{w}^{T}C\vec{w}}}\]

which is equivalent to:

\[\left(\vec{w}^{T}\vec{\mu}\right)\vec{w}=\left(\vec{w}^{T}C\vec{w}\right)C^{- 1}\vec{\mu} \tag{9}\]

If \(\vec{w}\) is a solution, then it must have the same direction as \(C^{-1}\vec{\mu}\). Conversely, any vector \(\vec{w}\propto C^{-1}\vec{\mu}\) is a solution of (9), as can be easily verified by substitution. Therefore, the (1-dimensional vector space of) extremals \(\vec{w}\) have the form:

\[\vec{w}=\lambda(C^{-1}\vec{\mu})\quad\lambda\in\mathbb{R}\]

that is the matricial equivalent of (6).

### Variational solution

An alternative approach, which avoids dealing with the differentiation of \(\sigma[E_{\mbox{\tiny tot}}]/\langle E_{\mbox{\tiny tot}}\rangle\), is the minimization of \(\mbox{Var}[E_{\mbox{\tiny tot}}]\) with respect to the \(w_{i}\)'s, with the constraint that \(\langle E_{\mbox{\tiny tot}}\rangle\) be constant while the \(w_{i}\)'s are varied, i.e.:

\[\langle E_{\mbox{\tiny tot}}\rangle=\sum_{i}w_{i}\mu_{i}=\mbox{const}.\]

The solution is found by means of the Lagrange multipliers technique, that yields:

\[0 = \frac{\partial}{\partial w_{k}}\left\{\mbox{Var}[E_{\mbox{\tiny tot }}]-2\lambda\langle E_{\mbox{\tiny tot}}\rangle\right\}\] \[= 2\left\{\sum_{i}C_{i}kw_{i}-\lambda\mu_{k}\right\}\]

from which the solution (6) is straightforward.

### Evaluation of statistical fluctuations on the weights

Generally, the uncertainties on the quantities \(\mu_{i}\)'s and \(C_{ij}\)'s are correlated. An analytical error propagation on formula (6) -- or (7) -- is not suitable, therefore a Monte-Carlo (MC) approach has been chosen. The steps are the following:

* Find a linear transform of the variables \(E_{i}\)'s: \[\hat{E}_{\tau}=\sum_{i}U_{\tau i}E_{i}\] such that the covariance matrix \[\hat{C}_{\tau s}=\text{Cov}\,[\hat{E}_{\tau};\,\hat{E}_{s}]\] is diagonal. This is always possible since the matrix \(C\) is symmetric; the transform matrix \(U\) is therefore orthogonal \((U^{-1}=U^{T}),\) and \[\hat{C}_{\tau s}=\sum_{ij}U_{\tau i}U_{sj}C_{ij}\]
* The variables \(\hat{E}_{\tau}\)'s are now uncorrelated. Their average values are: \[\langle\hat{E}_{\tau}\rangle=\hat{\mu}_{\tau}=\sum_{i}U_{\tau i}\mu_{i}\] and their spreads are: \[\hat{\sigma}_{\tau}=\sqrt{\hat{C}_{\tau\tau}}\] For a sample of \(N\) events, the statistical uncertainty on \(\hat{\mu}_{\tau}\) is: \[\text{RMS}[\hat{\mu}_{\tau}]=\frac{\hat{\sigma}_{\tau}}{\sqrt{N}}\] Under the hypothesis of large \(N\) and gaussian distribution, the uncertainty on \(\hat{\sigma}_{\tau}\) is uncorrelated with that on \(\hat{\mu}_{\tau},\) and amounts to: \[\text{RMS}[\hat{\sigma}_{\tau}]=\frac{\hat{\sigma}_{\tau}}{\sqrt{2N}}\]
* For each of the \(\hat{\mu}_{\tau}\)'s and \(\hat{\sigma}_{\tau}\)'s one can generate the corresponding smeared quantity \(\hat{\mu}_{\tau}^{*}\) (randomly sampled from a gaussian distribution centered in \(\hat{\mu}_{\tau},\) with standard deviation equal to \(\hat{\sigma}_{\tau}/\sqrt{N}\)) and \(\hat{\sigma}_{\tau}^{*}\) (randomly sampling the quantity \((\hat{\sigma}_{\tau}^{*}/\hat{\sigma}_{\tau})^{2}\) from a \(\chi^{2}\) distribution with \((N-1)\) degrees of freedom). Applying the inverse transform \(U^{T}\) one obtains \(\mu_{i}^{*}=\sum_{\tau}U_{\tau i}\hat{\mu}_{\tau}^{*}\) and \(C_{ij}^{*}=\sum_{\tau}U_{\tau i}U_{\tau j}(\hat{\sigma}_{\tau}^{*})^{2},\) from which a new set of weights \(w_{i}^{*}\)'s can be evaluated.

* One can repeat the previous procedure several times3 and get a histogram for each \(w_{i}^{*}\) (see Figure 2). The RMS spread of each histogram is then used as an estimate of the statistical uncertainty on \(w_{i}\). Footnote 3: \(N_{\rm MC}=10000\) would provide at least 1% precision on the central values of the weights distributions.

## 3 Application to a test beam data sample

The weights extracted using equation (7) have been applied to the data sample collected from the Module 13 test beam session.

### Data sample and analysis outline

The data set under exam is from the position scan performed on Module 13 with an electron beam at energy \(E_{\rm beam}=245\) GeV (694 data taking runs, most of which containing \(8000\div 10000\) events). The scanned region spans most of the interval \(1\leq\eta_{\rm cell}\leq 45\) (\(0.025\leq\eta\leq 1.15\)) for both \(1\leq\phi_{\rm cell}\leq 6\) and \(9\leq\phi_{\rm cell}\leq 13\)4.

Footnote 4: The angular position, usually defined by the pseudorapidity \(\eta\) and the azimuthal angle \(\phi\) (in radians), in this note will be often indicated by the coordinates \(\eta_{\rm cell},\phi_{\rm cell}\), which are expressed in units of Middle layer cells. Therefore, the Middle cell at lowest \(\eta,\phi\) in the module is labelled by \(\eta_{\rm cell}=0,\ \phi_{\rm cell}=0\), and since the granularity of this layer

Figure 2: Example of typical distributions for the weights \(w_{i}^{*}\), as obtained from the MC errors propagation. The values of \(\mu_{i}\)’s and \(C_{ij}\)’s are from an EMB test beam run, and the weights normalization is \(w_{3}=1\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

After this selection, the cluster energies from all the layers are summed together, and the total energy \(E\) for the selected events is plot into a histogram in the range \(0.8\cdot E_{\rm beam}\div 1.1\cdot E_{\rm beam}\). The distribution exhibits a large non-gaussian lower tail, due to a sizable contamination from pions and electrons that lost energy upstream (see Figure 3). The histogram peak is fit with a gaussian in a range between \(-1.5\sigma\) and \(+2.5\sigma\) from the peak. The result of the fit provides a peak value \(E_{\rm peak}\) and a width \(\sigma_{\rm gauss}\). The events satisfying the following requirement:

* \(|E-E_{\rm peak}|/\sigma_{\rm gauss}<3\)

are considered as "electrons" from now on.

#### 3.1.2 Run and cell selection

Not all the runs can be used for uniformity study and weights optimization, because of the limited statistics and due to local problems. Therefore:

* the position of the hit cell must be extracted from at least 50 events;

Figure 3: Energy distribution from a run taken at \(\eta_{\rm cell}=26\), \(\phi_{\rm cell}=3\) and \(E_{\rm beam}=245\) GeV. The gaussian fit to the peak is shown, and the labels **Mean**, **Sigma** are \(E_{\rm peak}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm gauss}\) respectively.

For each run, the cluster energy spectrum for all layers is histogrammed, using events matching criteria **A1** and **A2**, and the fraction of events above a given energy threshold is evaluated. If such fraction is too low, then the hit cell is probably dead or misbehaving, and the run is rejected. The selection criteria are:

* at least 80% of events must have \(E_{\rm{P}\,resample}^{\rm{cluster}}>0.2\) GeV;
* at least 70% of events must have \(E_{\rm{Strips}}^{\rm{cluster}}>10\) GeV;
* at least 70% of events must have \(E_{\rm{Middle}}^{\rm{cluster}}>100\) GeV;
* at least 80% of events must have \(E_{\rm{Back}}^{\rm{cluster}}>1\) GeV;

Notice that these criteria are used only to select runs: if a run is selected, then the event selection **A1--A5** is used.

To reject runs where the gaussian fit to the energy peak fails (e.g. due to neighbouring dead cells or calibration problems), a loose cut on the energy resolution is applied:

* \(\sigma_{\rm{gauss}}/E_{\rm{peak}}<2\%\)

After this selections, data from different runs belonging to the same hit cell are merged together to increase the statistics, and the gaussian fit is repeated.

* the analysis is performed only on the cells where at least 5000 selected events are collected, of which at least 100 are flagged as "electron" events.

The last requirement is quite loose: on average, in each cell \(\sim 10000\) events are collected, of which \(\sim 650\) are "electrons".

### Weights evaluation

For each selected cell, only "electron" events are used to evaluate the covariance matrix \(C_{ij}\) and the average energies \(\mu_{i}\). Then the weights are evaluated using equation (7). In the present case, the \(M\)-th layer (i.e. that collecting the largest energy signal) is the Middle layer, therefore \(\tilde{w}_{3}=1\).

A variation of this approach consists in grouping the Strips and Middle layers into one pseudo-layer with weight \(\tilde{w}_{2+3}=1\). The motivation is that Strips and Middle are contiguous and homogeneous in terms of constituent materials (not in granularity, of course), and should not suffer of longitudinal containment effects. Moreover, since the energies \(E_{\rm Strips}^{\rm{cluster}}\) and \(E_{\rm Middle}^{\rm{cluster}}\) recorded in Strips and Middle are strongly anti-correlated (\(\rho_{23}\sim-0.97\)), the spread of \(E_{\rm Strips}^{\rm{cluster}}+E_{\rm Middle}^{\rm{cluster}}\) is much narrower than that of \(E_{\rm Middle}^{\rm{cluster}}\) alone (\(\sim 4\) GeV instead of \(\sim 11\) GeV). Since the choice of the weights scale (i.e.

the constant \(\lambda\) in equation (6)) always involves some arbitrariness, taking as a reference Strips+Middle seems therefore reasonable. Of course, this normalization does not correct for the possibility that some shower develops in the material between the Presampler and the Strips.

The resulting weights are shown in Figure 4 and Figure 5, for normalizations \(\bar{w}_{3}=1\) and \(\bar{w}_{2+3}=1\) respectively. Qualitatively, the trends obtained in the two cases are similar. For all layers, the weights are clustered around "main distributions", with some exceptions of points scattered away, that however are affected by large statistical errors. The Presampler weight is \(\sim 1.5\div 2\), while that of the Strips, for the normalization \(\bar{w}_{3}=1\), regularly rises with \(\eta_{\rm cell}\), from 0.97 to 1.02, indicating that the material between Presampler and Strips also increases, as it is intuitive from projectivity considerations.

The weight of the Back has a more complicate structure, that can be understood in terms of the depth of the sampling layers. For \(\eta_{\rm cell}\geq 16\) the depth of Strips+Middle is constant, while that of the Back increases with \(\eta_{\rm cell}\) in the two ranges \(16\leq\eta_{\rm cell}\leq 31\) and \(32\leq\eta_{\rm cell}\leq 47\); the trend of the Back weight tends to compensate the resulting variation of containment. For \(\eta_{\rm cell}\leq 15\) the depth of the Middle decreases for decreasing \(\eta_{\rm cell}\), while that of the Back is constant, therefore the longitudinal leakage is even larger, but more energy flows through the Back; as a result, the Back weight does not need to increase further as \(\eta_{\rm cell}\to 0\).

The dependance of the weights on \(\phi_{\rm cell}\) does not exhibit any evident trend. For this reason, their values at each \(\eta_{\rm cell}\) have been averaged over all the \(\phi_{\rm cell}\)'s (see Figures 6 and 7 for the choices \(\tilde{w}_{3}=1\) and \(\tilde{w}_{2+3}=1\)). To reduce the local fluctuations, the profiles as a function of \(\eta_{\rm cell}\) have been fit with a combination of exponential functions in the three mentioned \(\eta\) ranges.

### Energy uniformity and resolution

The total energy released in the EMB (sum of the cluster energies of all the layers) can be plot as a function of the hit cell position \(\eta_{\rm cell}^{\rm hit},\phi_{\rm cell}^{\rm hit}\). The bare sum of cluster energies (i.e. without applying weights) is displayed in Figure 8. The trend of the total energy as a function of \(\eta_{\rm cell}^{\rm hit}\) is rather flat for the region \(\eta_{\rm cell}^{\rm hit}>32\) (electrode B), but shows a slight slope for the region \(\eta_{\rm cell}^{\rm hit}<31\) (electrode A). Moreover, a fall of few GeV is observable between the levels of electrode A and electrode B. The drop at \(\eta_{\rm cell}^{\rm hit}=31,32\) is due to the small gap between electrodes A and B.

Applying the fit weights displayed in Figure 7, with the normalization \(\tilde{w}_{2+3}=1\), the total energy profile as a function of \(\eta_{\rm cell}^{\rm hit}\) changes slightly, as in Figure 9. The two visible improvements are that now the profile in the electrode A region is flatter, and that the fall between electrodes A and B has disappeared.

on the optimal weights can be efficiently evaluated through a numerical MC approach.

Since the optimal weights are defined up to an overall multiplicative constant, two different normalizations have been developed and tested, consisting in constraining the weight of Middle layer, or that of the Strips+Middle pseudo-layer, to be equal to 1. The algorithm have been applied with success to the Module 13 test beam data analysis. The Strips+Middle pseudo-layer normalization has proved to be the most performing, providing a sensible improvement in the energy uniformity and scale. The relative energy resolution improves by \(0.1\%\div 0.2\%\) with both normalizations.

Future plans are to test the algorithm on data from different EMB production modules, in order to study the stability of the optimal weights, and to investigate their behavior at different beam energies. Further studies will be done using MonteCarlo data sets, both referring to the test beam setup and to the full ATLAS environment.
