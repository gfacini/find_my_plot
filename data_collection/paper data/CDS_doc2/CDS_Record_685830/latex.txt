## Description of the ATLAS Organisation

Torsten Akesson

### Introduction

This report gives an overview of the ATLAS organisation as decided by the Collaboration Board and defined in the ATLAS Internal Notes [1, 2].

### ATLAS organisation

The management operates under the constitution of the ATLAS collaboration [1] which specifies that the collaboration shall have a separation between policy-making and executive powers. This is implemented as shown in the block diagram below:

### Policy

The full collaboration has week-long meetings (ATLAS Weeks) four times a year. The general forum, _the Plenary Meeting (PM)_, and the policy deciding body, _Collaboration Board (CB)_ assemble at these occasions. Systems give overview presentations at the PM and issues to be decided in the CB are presented and openly debated first in the PM before being brought up at the CB for decision. The decisions in the CB are taken by consensus or vote. All votes are open except those concerning persons, e.g. the Spokesperson or CB chair elections. Each institution of ATLAS is represented in the CB and has one vote. Larger institutions can at their discretion have two persons in the CB, but still with only one vote. The exact rules for CB decisions and elections can be found in [1]. The Executive Board (see below) members are ex-officio at the CB.

The CB chairperson can have an Advisory Group to help prepare the agenda. The Advisory Group is nominated by the CB-chair and elected by the CB for the duration the chairpersons office. The Advisory Group also prepares the Spokesperson elections and is the body where especially sensitive issues can be brought up, e.g. issues concerning persons in the executive organisation. The ATLAS Spokesperson, Deputy, Resource and Technical Co-ordinators are in attendance in the Advisory Group, but the CB-chair can decide to hold some meetings without these people present.

The CB can form _Overview Boards_ to monitor the development of crucial items. Currently, the only example is the _Magett Overview Board_ monitoring the largest common project item in the experiment, the magnets.

The _Resource Review Board_, \(RRB\), is the body where the ATLAS resources are approved upon proposals from the collaboration, and monitored. It is composed of representatives of the national funding agencies, the CERN management and the ATLAS management. It is chaired by the CERN Director of Research. The RRB discusses the different national contributions and the Memoranda of Understanding. Inkind contributions to the Common Projects have to be approved in the RRB.

The formal commitments to the ATLAS construction are made through the Memorandum of Understanding signed by the funding agencies and CERN.

### Overall Execution

Having clearly defined System interfaces and guide-lines for organisation [2], performance and technical co-ordination allows Subsidiarity to be a governing principle for the execution of ATLAS; the decision making is done when possible at the System level. However, global directives, approvals and monitoring have to be done centrally to ensure overall physics performance, a synchronous time schedule, integratability, and uniform hardware and software quality in the project.

The Spokesperson is the highest level executive of ATLAS, and as such has the overall responsibility of the ATLAS execution. He or she organises the day-to-day execution of the project. He or she represents the ATLAS executive branch at the CB and is the ATLAS contact to the outside world and the CERN management. The Spokesperson may have one or two deputies. Technical co-ordination is delegated to a Technical Co-ordinator and resource co-ordination to a Resource Co-ordinator. Both are CERN staff. The Technical Co-ordinator monitors the technical aspects of the construction of the System, is responsible for the detector integration, for the overall construction of the detector and of the experimental area, and for common project issues. The Resource Co-ordinator monitors and manages the financial and human resources of the collaboration.

Appointments are done in consultation with the CERN management for the Spokesperson, and in agreement with the CERN management for the Technical and Resource Co-ordinators.

About once a month the _Executive Board (EB)_ meets. The EB is the main body for directing the execution of the ATLAS project and for direct communication between the ATLAS management and the Systems. It monitors the execution of the individual Systems and discusses matters involving several Systems. The EB meetings are prepared by the Spokesperson who claims them. The EB is composed of:

* The ATLAS management (Spokesperson, Deputy Spokesperson, Technical Co-ordinator and Resource Co-ordinator)
* The System Project Leaders and for some Systems additional representation depending on their size and complexity.
* The Magnet Project Leader
* Technical co-ordination staff (in attendence)
* Up to two additional individuals chosen to ensure an overall balance in the complete EB.
* The CB Chairperson and Deputy as ex-officio

The contact between the ATLAS management and the national funding agencies is maintained via an ancillary structure of _National Contact Physicists_ relating to the Spokesperson and the Resource Co-ordinator.

In difficult cases, e.g. when major technology choices have to be made, a review panel can be appointed. Such a panel is chaired by an ATLAS physicist not directly involved in the issue.

### System Interaction with the ATLAS Management

An ATLAS System roughly correspond to a performance task. It is a major activity involving a set of institutions which will produce hardware and software. A System is constrained by a performance specification and the integration requirements of the whole experiment, and has to work inside a geometrical envelope and a cost ceiling. This is specified in its Technical Design Report (TDR). The original version of the TDR is submitted to the LHCC for construction approval. It defines the design, production procedure including quality assurance, maintenance, commissioning and sharing of responsibilities. This includes the formal breakdown structures that are linked to the highest levels of the ATLAS breakdown structures, and the scheduling that is included in the overall ATLAS project planning.

The internal ATLAS TDR approval procedure is the guarantee that the System is coherent with the overall ATLAS organisation and quality. The TDRs are regularly revised to be consistent with the System being constructed. Depending on the level of changes the revision approvals are done at the System levels, by the technical co-ordination, the Spokesperson or the EB. Changes that could have a major impact on the experiment have to be approved by the CB.

The Project Leader regularly communicates the System status to the ATLAS management and technical co-ordination.

The ATLAS management regularly discuss with the Project Leader questions relevant to the System execution and resources.

### System Execution

### General Organisation

The large number of institutions and people involved necessitates a management structure. This management has to have the solid support in the System collaboration and an excellent working relationship with the central ATLAS management team. The day-to-day System execution is lead by the Project Leader who is usually a member of the ATLAS Executive Board. The System has a Steering Group and an Institute Board. If it is convenient for the System, these bodies can be combined in order to be able to carry out the steering and decision making in one group. The Project Leader is the System representative within the ATLAS organisation.

### Steering Groups

Each System has a Steering Group reflecting the range of activities within itself and bringing together the people leading these efforts. The Steering Group takes decisions on technical execution matters and make recommendations to the Institute Board on major technical choices and on matters of sharing resources and responsibilities. The Steering Group is chaired by the Project Leader who prepares its agenda. Its members are nominated by the Project Leader based on broad consultation in the System community and approved by the Institute Board. The frequency of Steering Group meetings shall be sufficiently high to ensure the effective leadership of the System execution. The Project Leader shall routinely consult the Steering Group whenever significant issues arise. The ATLAS management members are ex-officio in all Steering Groups.

### Institute Boards

Each System has an Institute Board. The Institute Board takes decisions on major technical choices and on sharing of resources and responsibilities. Major technology choices affecting the overall performance of ATLAS have to be brought forward to the collaboration as a whole for decision in the Collaboration Board [1]. The institutions are the source of money and manpower, and therefore all major questions involving sharing of responsibilities and contribution of resources have to be agreed upon by the Institute Board. The Institute Board also proposes the Project Leader candidate for approval by ATLAS, and approves the Steering Group composition. In major matters concerning resources the Institute Board shall invite the ATLAS Resource Co-ordinator.

### Sub-System

Each System may be broken up into smaller organisations, Sub-Systems, which in some cases may more directly correspond to the direct detector construction tasks. These Sub-Systems may well have their internal organisations with Project Leaders, Steering Groups and Institute Boards as described in the System organisation. However, the formal lines of responsibilities go through the System Project Leader.

### ATLAS Project Leaders

### Appointment

The Project Leader candidate is nominated by the System participants, short-listed by the Steering Group, elected by the System Institute Board, proposed by the spokesperson to the Collaboration Board and approved by it. The appointment is for two years with the possible extension according to the ATLAS organisation rules[1].

### Mandate

The Project Leader is the person directly and ultimately responsible to the ATLAS collaboration, for ensuring that the design and construction of the corresponding System are carried out on schedule, within the cost ceiling, and in a way that guarantees the required performance and reliability, within the framework of the ATLAS resource planning. He or she collaborate closely with the ATLAS technical and resource co-ordination. The Project Leader shall bring up to discussion, with the ATLAS management, incompatibilities between the required project development and the available resources.

While the responsibility to the ATLAS collaboration remains at all times with the Project Leader, he or she may choose to delegate some tasks, or to appoint people such as project engineer, electronics project engineer, s/w responsible, etc. to assist in managing the project. Such appointments must specify a clear set of responsibilities; they shall be approved by the Steering Group and confirmed by the Institute Board.
