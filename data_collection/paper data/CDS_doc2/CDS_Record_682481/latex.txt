**Abstract**

The possibility of observing the signal from \(\rm B_{c}\) mesons in the ATLAS experiment was studied. In the decay mode \(\rm B_{c}\to J/\psi\pi\) followed by the leptonic decay \(\rm J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-}\) an estimate of the number of produced \(\rm B_{c}\) per year was done combined with a study of the background.

Introduction

At the beginning of the LHC operation studies in B-physics will take place. This is experimentally easiest with the initial low luminosity \({\cal L}=10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)[1], since pile-up effects are small and vertex detectors very close to the beam pipe are expected to survive for several years. The ATLAS detector has many properties suitable for B-physics, with a powerful and flexible trigger system. An efficient track reconstruction and electron identification down to low \(p_{\rm T}\) is available due to the Transition Radiation Tracker and the silicon detectors.

In the framework of QCD potential models [2] the \({\rm B_{c}}\) has an interpolating position between the charmonium and bottomonium-resonances. The data from the studies of these resonances can be used in the description of the \({\rm B_{c}}\) meson. An experimental observation of \({\rm B_{c}}\) could serve as a test for this approach and the mechanisms of the heavy quark production, hadronization and decays.

## 2 Properties of the decay channel

The decay that have been studied to detect the \({\rm B_{c}}\) is

\[{\rm B_{c}}\rightarrow{\rm J}/\psi\pi\qquad{\rm J}/\psi\rightarrow{\rm e}^{+}{ \rm e}^{-} \tag{1}\]

with the detectable decay products \({\rm e}^{+}{\rm e}^{-}\pi\).

The probability of the decay in fig. 1 is small, the branching ratio for \({\rm B_{c}}\rightarrow{\rm J}/\psi\pi\) is calculated to be \(0.3\pm 0.1\%\)[8]. The reason for studying this decay, though the probability is so small, is that the \({\rm J}/\psi\) can be mass determined to a high precision. Because there are no neutrinos the decay can be fully reconstructed. The measured branching ratio for the leptonic decay of the \({\rm J}/\psi\) is \(6.02\pm 0.19\%\)[12].

Figure 1: The weak decay of the positively charged \({\rm B_{c}}\).

The cross section for the production of b-quarks is dependent on the collision energy. According to theoretical predictions the total cross section for \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\)-production is taken to be

\[\sigma_{\mathrm{b\bar{b}}}\sim 500^{+200}_{-300}\ \mu\mathrm{b}\]

at a collision energy of 14 TeV [1]. The probability of a b-quark forming into a \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\) has been calculated by [6] to be in the order of \(10^{-3}\), giving a cross section of 500 nb for \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\) production. The cross section for the decay channel is

\[\sigma_{decay}=\sigma_{\mathrm{B_{c}}}\cdot BR(\mathrm{B_{c}}\to J/\psi\pi) \cdot BR(J/\psi\to e^{+}e^{-})=90\mathrm{pb},\]

including the theoretical uncertainties the cross section varies between 15 and 200 pb.

From the given integrated luminosity \(L=10\,fb^{-1}\)[1] for one year initial running at LHC, the total number of \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\)'s produced can be calculated for the decay channel to be

\[N=L\cdot\sigma_{decay}=900,000\]

produced during one year. If the uncertainties in the theoretical calculations are implemented the number of \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\) produced per year varies from 150,000 to 2,000,000. These events are not yet triggered. The trigger for a b-event in the ATLAS detector is a muon of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>6\)\(\mathrm{GeV}/c\) and within pseudorapidity range 2.2.

## 3 Event generation

PYTHIA 5.7 has been used for the simulation of the \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\). Simulating general collisions with PYTHIA approximately one in every hundred event contains a \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\)-pair 3. To save simulation time, the program can be modified so that a \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\)-pair is created in every event. In the PYTHIA code this way of generating b-quarks is understood as the MSEL=5 option. Demanding this production means that the \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\)-pair is produced in PYTHIA only for lowest order Feynman-diagrams as in fig. 2. One could imagine that the corrections are small for higher orders (fig. 3), but for \(\mathrm{b\bar{b}}\)-production this is not correct. In fact only 30% of the production is due to the lowest order diagrams as fig. 2. This could be a problem, but with the results of [5] it is seen that the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-spectrum of b-quarks from lowest order diagrams has the same shape as for higher order corrections, at least for low \(p_{\rm T}\) b-quarks. Therefore the B\({}_{\rm c}\)'s produced in diagrams of order \(\alpha_{\rm s}^{2}\) (fig. 2) are good representatives, looking at the \(p_{\rm T}\)-spectra of the b-quarks.

For the lowest order diagrams the angular topology concerning the creation of b-quarks differ from higher orders. In the lowest order diagrams the b-quarks are usually created almost back-to-back while for higher order diagrams the angle between the quarks is smaller because they are produced by a gluon splitting into a b\(\bar{\rm b}\)-pair. In the event generation this effect is not taken into account.

The production of c-quarks is not the same as for b-quarks. Instead a b-quark will emit a gluon that splits into a c\(\bar{\rm c}\)-pair as illustrated in fig. 2. This means that there is no easy way to generate the B\({}_{\rm c}\)'s in every event directly.

Of the B\({}_{\rm c}\)'s produced only a few percent pass the first trigger level with a muon of \(p_{\rm T}>\) 6.0 GeV/c and \(|\eta|\leq\) 2.2. The program is modified to increase this rate using the CKIN(3) parameter in PYTHIA that sets a lower limit on the \(p_{\rm T}\) for the hard subprocess. A study was made looking at how different \(p_{\rm T}\)-values of this hard subprocess influenced the number of B\({}_{\rm c}\) produced with a triggering muon. A value of \(p_{\rm T}>\) 8 GeV/c fulfils the demand that not many extra B\({}_{\rm c}\)'s are produced but that the number of muon triggered events are increased.

A change was made in the PYTHIA-program to increase statistics of B\({}_{\rm c}\) mesons further. The gluon splitting in PYTHIA works as follows. Even if the gluon carries the energy needed to create a pair of c-quarks, or more unlikely to create another pair of b-quarks, this does not happen every time. In the program the probability of the quark-creation is the same for the different flavours of quarks lying under the threshold determined by the energy of the gluon. An implementation is done in the program so that every time it is possible to create a pair of c-quarks it is done. This improves the statistics of B\({}_{c}\)'s by a factor 4-5, taking into account the production of b-quarks in the gluon splitting. This gives of course a larger production of c-quarks, because all the gluon splittings which have an energy above the c\(\overline{c}\) threshold will produce a c\(\overline{c}\) pair. It could be suspected that the changes introduced in the gluon splitting could lead to an increased production of J/\(\psi\), but in the generation only 0.2% more J/\(\psi\)'s were created, not causing any problems. The specific changes of the PYTHIA 5.7 code is discussed in Appendix A.

## 4 The analysis program

To implement detector effects the following resolutions were used with the PYTHIA value as mean:

* Transverse momenta: \(\frac{\sigma_{\mathrm{PT}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\)= 5.0 \(\cdot 10^{-4}\,p_{\mathrm{T}}\oplus 0.012\)
* Angles \((\theta/\phi)\): \(\sigma_{\theta/\phi}=2.0/0.5\) mrad
* Impact parameter \((\mathrm{binary\ pixels})\): \(18\oplus 61/p_{\mathrm{T}}\sqrt{|\sin\,\theta|}\)\(\mu\)m
* z-coordinate \((\mathrm{binary\ pixels})\): \(84\oplus 130/p_{\mathrm{T}}\sqrt{|\sin\,\theta|}^{3}\)\(\mu\)m

The parametrisation for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is set taking into account the initial running with low luminosity where B-physics studies are important. To take bremsstrahlung effects into account the transverse momenta was smeared with a different resolution for electrons and positrons. How this is done is discussed in Appendix B.

With the Gaussian distributed data the track of a particle is reconstructed as a straight line. The three candidate tracks from e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\pi\) are fitted together and the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit is calculated. The \(\chi^{2}\) is calculated as

\[\chi^{2}(x,y,z)=\sum_{tracks}\left(\frac{d_{xy}^{2}}{\sigma_{ip}^{2}}+\frac{d_ {z}^{2}}{\sigma_{z}^{2}}\right).\]

In the calculations the distance in the xy-plane is only dependent on the impact parameter and therefore it is normalised in the \(\chi^{2}\) with its resolution and likewise for the component along the z-axis. Since the minimal \(\chi^{2}\) will be at the vertex point for a real \(B_{\rm c}\), the mean vertex point of the three candidate tracks calculated by PYTHIA were used as start-values in the minimisation. The program MINUIT Ver 94.1 [14] was used for the minimisation. The aim was not to create a rigourous vertex algorithm, just to test the potential of such an algorithm. The \(\chi^{2}\) value for the true \(B_{\rm c}\)'s are plotted in fig. 4 and fit well comparing to the \(\chi^{2}\) function of three degrees of freedom.

The knowledge of the vertex point makes it possible to calculate the decay length, evaluated in the xy-plane.

## 5 Results

The mass of the \(B_{\rm c}\) and its excited state \(B_{\rm c}^{*}\) were set to be 6.258 and 6.320 GeV/\(c^{2}\) according to [9]. The lifetime of \(B_{\rm c}\) was set to be 1 ps [9]. The masses of the \(c\)- and \(b\)-quarks were defined as 1.3 and 4.5 GeV/\(c^{2}\). A total of 13,912 \(B_{\rm c}\)-mesons were generated with the simulation technique as described. The sample contained of 5.6 million \(b\bar{b}\)-events with an integrated CPU-time of 45 days on a HP-735. In fig. 5 the \(p_{\rm T}\) and rapidity-distributions for the \(B_{\rm c}\) are shown, normalised to a cross section of 500 nb. The shape of the distributions

look like the theoretical predictions of [10]4 but the distributions are biased towards high \(p_{\rm T}\).

Footnote 4: The normalisation of the distribution is not the same as for [10].

### The \({\rm B_{c}}\)-signal analysis

With an assumed cross section of 500 \(\mu\)b for beauty production at LHC a total of \(5\cdot 10^{12}\) pairs of \({\rm b\bar{b}}\) are produced per year, given an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\)[1]. Since the \({\rm B_{c}}\)'s generated with \(p_{\rm T}>\)8 GeV/c for the hard subprocess are good representatives only if the event contains the 1st level trigger, one has to know how often this occur. According to the Technical Proposal [1] 0.46% of the \({\rm b\bar{b}}\)-events are expected to pass the level 1 trigger. The cross section for the process to occur is

\[\sigma_{{\rm b\bar{b}},muontrig}=0.46\%\cdot\sigma_{{\rm b\bar{b}}}=2.3\pm 0.9\mu{\rm b}\]

with the \({\rm b\bar{b}}\) cross section as before. In the analysis 974 \({\rm B_{c}}\) fulfils this demand.

Shown in tab. 1 are the different cuts that are applied after the level 1 muon trigger. The cuts are implemented in the same order as tab. 1 and the percentage shows how many \({\rm B_{c}}\) that are left when the cuts are applied one after another. The custom pseudorapidity are defined from the range of the detector. The demand on the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the electron clearly fulfilthe condition set for the extra level 2 requirements of [1]. The cut on the angle between the J/\(\psi\) and the pion is very efficient for the combinatorial background of the event. In fig. 6 the \(\cos\beta\)-statistics are shown for B\({}_{\rm c}\) and combinatorial background. Assuming a track reconstruction efficiency of 77% [13] for the decay J/\(\psi\to{\rm e}^{+}{\rm e}^{-}\) and 95% for the pion identification, a total track reconstruction efficiency of 73% is obtained.

The combinations that pass these cuts are shown in fig. 7. The mass distribution of the B\({}_{\rm c}\) is displayed with the combinatorial background. The combinatorial background has no elements near the mass region of the B\({}_{\rm c}\) peak. The area of the B\({}_{\rm c}\)-signal is fitted with a Gaussian distribution. The mean value from this fit is 6.260 GeV/\(c^{2}\) in good agreement with the value of 6.258 GeV/\(c^{2}\) set in PYTHIA, and a resolution from the fit of 53 MeV/\(c^{2}\). This would give a mass determination of the B\({}_{\rm c}\) around 5 MeV/\(c^{2}\). The number of B\({}_{\rm c}\) produced during one year of running is calculated to be

\[N_{B_{\rm c}}=L\cdot\sigma_{\rm b5,\it muontrig}\cdot BR({\rm b}\to{\rm B}_{ \rm c}\to{\rm J}/\psi\pi)\cdot BR({\rm J}/\psi\to{\rm e}^{+}{\rm e}^{-})\cdot \varepsilon_{rec}. \tag{2}\]

It is standard to look at a mass window of 2.8 standard deviations in the distribution. That is in the region

\[{\rm m}_{{\rm B}_{\rm c}}\pm 1.4\,\sigma=6.260\,\pm 0.074,\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Geometry & Acceptance \\ \hline \(|\eta|_{\rm c}\leq\) 2.5 & 73\% \\ \hline \(|\eta|_{\rm\pi}\leq\) 2.5 & 94\% \\ \hline \hline
2nd level trigger & Acceptance \\ \hline \(p_{\rm T}(e)>\) 1 GeV/\(c\) & 74\% \\ \hline \(p_{\rm T}(\pi)>\) 1 GeV/\(c\) & 91\% \\ \hline \hline Reconstruction & Efficiency \\ \hline \(\Delta M({\rm J}/\psi)<\) 50 MeV/\(c^{2}\) & 86\% \\ \hline \(\cos\beta>\) 0.25 & 90\% \\ \hline \(\chi^{2}<\) 8 & 83\% \\ \hline \(L_{xy}>\) 300 \(\mu\)m & 57\% \\ \hline Track reconstruction & 73\% \\ \hline \hline TOTAL & 12\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The number of true B\({}_{\rm c}\) that pass each cut. With 974 B\({}_{\rm c}\) with 1st level trigger, around 120 are left after the cuts. The \(\cos\beta\) represents the angle between the reconstructed J/\(\psi\) and the pion. The \(\chi^{2}\) gives how well the J/\(\psi\) and the pion fit to a common vertex, while \(L_{xy}\) is the decay length of the B\({}_{\rm c}\) in the xy-plane. The cuts are applied one after another.

the number of B\({}_{c}\)'s are counted. This region corresponds to a mass window between 6.186 - 6.334 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) with 139 B\({}_{c}\), that gives us a reconstruction efficiency of 10% within the mass window. With the given parameters eq. 2 is evaluated with a statistical error giving the result

\[433\pm 36(stat)\]

reconstructed B\({}_{c}\) per year. If one invoke the large uncertainties of the cross section of b\(\bar{b}\)-production and the branching ratios, the number of reconstructed B\({}_{c}\)'s per year varies between 70 and 960.

### The background analysis

The background that fakes B\({}_{c}\) events comes from b\(\bar{b}\)-events. The production of J/\(\psi\) in the primary vertex (cc\(\bar{c}\)) is not taken into account since it is unlikely to have a high \(p_{T}\) muon in the event. In the production of b-quarks two possible backgrounds are concerned:

* B-mesons decaying into a J/\(\psi\). This gives us a J/\(\psi\) in a secondary vertex which a vertex fit does not take away. It could then combine with a high energetic pion faking a B\({}_{c}\).
* Electrons and positrons coming from leptonic decays could fake a J/\(\psi\) and combine with a pion.

Figure 6: The \(\cos\beta\)-statistics for the signal (lower distribution) and the combinatorial background (higher distribution).

In the generation of background the same CKIN(3)-parameter was used as for the signal and only lower order diagrams were generated. A total of 3.9 million b\(\bar{\rm b}\)-events were generated with an integrated CPU-time of 32 days on a HP\(\cdot\)735. The J/\(\psi\) was forced to decay into e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) to study the effect of real J/\(\psi\)'s from B-mesons. To increase statistics it was implemented that all the anti-B-mesons were to decay to a muon and anything. It was observed that "anything" predominantly was different kinds of D-mesons, always decaying together with the muon. These D-mesons are dangerous since they often decay to electrons which will be in a secondary vertex.

The background was analysed in parallel with the signal. The cuts of tab. 2 are very efficient in suppressing the background, leaving most of the signal. The effect these cuts have on the background are compared with the signal.

The background collected after these cuts contained 848 fake B\({}_{\rm c}\). One should not compare these plots with the one of the signal because the integrated luminosity is not the same. One should also remember that the background from real J/\(\psi\)'s is favoured by a factor 20, since they have been forced to decay into e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\). In the decay mode

Figure 7: The left figure shows the mass distribution of the B\({}_{\rm c}\) with a clear peak. The hatched distribution represents the combinatorial background from the B\({}_{\rm c}\)-events. In the right figure a Gaussian fit is made to the distribution of real B\({}_{\rm c}\)’s.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Reconstruction & Signal & Background \\ \hline \(\Delta M({\rm J}/\psi)<\) 50 MeV/\(c^{2}\) & 86\% & 22\% \\ \hline \(\cos\beta>\) 0.25 & 90\% & 44\% \\ \hline \(\chi^{2}<\) 8 & 83\% & 31\% \\ \hline \(L_{xy}>\) 300 \(\mu\)m & 57\% & 33\% \\ \hline \hline TOTAL & 37\% & 1\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: The reconstruction efficiencies of the signal compared with the background. The \(\cos\beta\) represents the angle between the reconstructed \({\rm J}/\psi\) and the pion. The \(\chi^{2}\) gives how well the reconstructed \({\rm J}/\psi\) and pion fit to a common vertex, while \(L_{xy}\) is the decay length of the \({\rm B_{c}}\) in the xy-plane. The cuts are applied one after another.

Figure 8: The true \({\rm J}/\psi\) from a B-decay has combined with a pion from the same decay. In case of a several pion-decay the invariant mass is of course lower, but always less than 5.5 GeV/\(c^{2}\).

The remaining 261 background events are split up in two plots (fig. 9). One representing the real J/\(\psi\) combining with a pion that does not come from the same vertex, and one of fake reconstructed J/\(\psi\). The statistics of fig. 9

is not impressing, but this is always a problem in simulating background. If smart cuts are imposed it is possible to remove all the background coming from leptonic decays. In the background we see electrons and positrons decaying from D-mesons combining into a J/\(\psi\), but also the decay of \(\pi^{0}\) (coming from an excited D-meson) into e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\gamma\) then combining with a positron from a B- or D-meson. With a sophisticated secondary vertex algorithm it should be possible to suppress these decays.

An estimate of the background produced in one year can be achieved with the following method. Assuming a nearby flat background in the range of 5.5 - 7.0 GeV/\(c^{2}\) of fig. 9, the mass distribution (number of background events per GeV/\(c^{2}\)) is calculated. Counting the events in the mass region the result

\[\frac{6\cdot 0.06+2}{1.5}=1.57\ \ \mathrm{events}/(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2})\]

is obtained. The number of events (6 and 2) in this mass region can be seen in fig. 9, with the six events from real J/\(\psi\) events normalised since they were forced to decay into e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\).

Figure 9: The left figure shows the background from true J/\(\psi\)’s combined with a random pion/kaon not from the decay. On the right the background from fake J/\(\psi\)’s. The background on the left figure is favoured since the J/\(\psi\) is forced to decay to electrons.

The number of background events produced in one year can be calculated as

\[N_{fake}=L\cdot\sigma_{\rm b\bar{b},muntrig}\cdot\varepsilon_{fake}\]

with the reconstruction efficiency \(\varepsilon_{fake}\) for the fake \(\rm B_{c}\)'s. Looking at the same mass window as the signal i.e. 145 MeV /\(c^{2}\), one can calculate the number of background events to be 0.23 within 145 MeV/\(c^{2}\). The number of generated events that fulfils the 1st level muon trigger is around 270,000. Taking into account the track reconstruction efficiency of 73% a fake reconstruction efficiency of

\[\varepsilon_{fake}=6.2\cdot 10^{-7}\]

is obtained. The results leads us to a total of 14,300 background events per year. The analysis shows that the dominant background comes from the leptonic decays faking a \(\rm J/\psi\).

In fig. 10 the mass spectrum is plotted for background and signal. It could look like this in the results from the experiment. The background is fluctuating around 14,300 and on top of this is seen a little peak.

To test whether the seen peak really is a peak and not statistical fluctuations the

Figure 10: An impression of how the \(\rm B_{c}\)-signal in the electron channel could look like after 1 year of running at LHC.

statistical significance of the peak is calculated. It is defined as

\[S=\frac{signal}{\sqrt{background}}.\]

In the analysis with a signal of \(\sim 400\) and a background of 14,300, a statistical significance of 3.4 is obtained for one year of data taking. The experiment is expected to run for three years with the trigger described in this note. This is of course enhancing the significance with a factor \(\sqrt{3}\), giving a significance of 6.

## 6 Conclusions

In the study of the decay channel \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\rightarrow\mathrm{J}/\psi\pi\) with \(\mathrm{J}/\psi\rightarrow\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\) approximate 400 \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\) can be reconstructed after one year. Taking into account the error of the theoretical calculations, which is much larger than the statistical error, a total of 70 to 960 \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\) are reconstructed per year. The mass of the \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\) can be determined with an accuracy of 5 \(\mathrm{MeV}/c^{2}\). The background events are estimated to be in the order of 14,000 events per year giving a statistical significance of 3.4. After three years of data taking a significance of 6 is achieved. If the theoretical predictions of cross sections and branching ratios are in good agreement with the experimental values, and with a reasonable background, then the \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\) will be visible in the decay channel.

The main uncertainties in the present analysis are:

* In the generation of signal and background only lowest order diagrams are generated. Although there is an argument that the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-distribution has the same shape for lowest and higher orders, the angular correlations of b-quark production is not the same. The angular correlations could be important for the background since decaying leptons from produced B-mesons or later D-mesons get tracks closer together increasing the probability to form fake secondary vertices.
* The misidentification of hadrons could give a large contribution to the background. A hadron, e.g. a pion, could be misidentified as an electron and then combine with an electron to form a fake \(\mathrm{J}/\psi\). This background is ignored in the present analysis.
* In the theoretical calculations for the lifetime of the \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\), there are some contradictions. According to [9] a lifetime of 1 ps could be expected, but in the calculations by [11] they predict a lifetime between 0.4-0.7ps. If the decay time is smaller the significance of the signal will be lower since the density of other tracks increases when the decay length for the \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\) becomes smaller.
* The uncertainties according the probability of creating a \(\mathrm{B_{c}}\) is large, in fact only the order of magnitude is known.

Changes in the PYTHIA 5.7 code

To get the wanted effect of increased cc-production, changes were made in the code of the subroutine LUSHOW in PYTHIA 5.7 for the branching process g \(\to\) q\(\overline{\mbox{q}}\). In the LUSHOW subroutine changes were only made in the code under the comment line shown in fig. 11.

The code line KFLB=1+INT(MSTJ(45)*RLU(0)) tells us the flavour of the branching g \(\to\) q\(\overline{\mbox{q}}\), MSTJ(45) is the maximum number of flavours (normally 5) that can be produced while RLU(0) gives a random number between 0 and 1. This line is replaced in the code with KFLB=4, where 4 represents the flavour charm, imposing that the gluon always branches to cc. The code line IF (PMQ.GE.1.) GOTO 390 states if it is not kinematically possible to create the quark pair, then we go back in the program to generate another quark pair that hopefully is kinematically possible to create. This line is replaced with a section that normalises the quark production so that lighter quarks are produced in the branching if it is not kinematically possible to create a cc pair. The new code that is implemented is shown in fig. 12.

## Appendix B The \(p_{\rm T}\) resolution for electrons

According to the Technical proposal [1] the performance of a bremsstrahlung fit for electrons of \(p_{\rm T}=\)20 GeV / \(c\) has been studied with the results of tab. 3.

The parametrisation of \(p_{\rm T}\) has the form A\(\oplus\)B/\(p_{\rm T}\) where A reflects the detector precision and B the multiple scattering. The second term dominates for low-momentum tracks.

The value of A has been normalised with the use of the values from tab. 3. The results in tab. 3 is obtained with data from the calorimeter but for low \(p_{\rm T}\) tracks the calorimeter gives no useful information, so this is just
