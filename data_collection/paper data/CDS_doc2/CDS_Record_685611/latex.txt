###### Abstract

In this short note we describe the possible use of thin-gap chambers in the ATLAS muon system. We propose to use this technology as a trigger device and a provider of a second coordinate measurements both in the barrel and endcap regions. With its high-rate capability and good position resolution it could be also used as the tracker in the forward region.

Introduction

Thin-gap chambers operating in a saturated mode have been developed [1] at the Weizmann Institute for the use in the OPAL Pole-Tip Hadron Calorimeter[2] and Endcap Electromagnetic Presampler[3]. The devices were developed in 1983-1984 and a mass production facility was established in 1985 to produce the \(500\times 0.7\)m\({}^{2}\) detectors needed for the OPAL project. The detectors consist of 50 \(\mu\)m wires spaced every 2 mm, sandwiched between two graphite cathode at a distance of 1.6 mm from the anode plane. Behind the graphite cathode planes there are strips or pads to perform a capacitive readout in any desired geometry.

The general characteristics of these detectors are summarized in the following. The details are found in the references [1][2][3].

1. Fast signals, with typical rise-time of 10 ns.
2. 100% efficiency: A single layer of the chamber shows no measurable inefficiency except a small area of dead space needed for wire support.
3. Good rate capabilities: with an operating voltage of 3.5 KV, rates of 300K particles/cm\({}^{2}\)/sec can be achieved without signal deterioration.
4. Saturated mode operation: this leads to small Landau tails (\(<2\%\) of the pulse height distribution contained in the tails), and in particular the response to slow neutrons is similar to the one to minimal ionizing particles (M.I.P.).
5. Small parallax: the signal obtained by the passage of a minimum ionizing particle is independent of the incident angles up to 45\({}^{\circ}\).
6. Insensitive to magnetic field: in OPAL the detectors are operated inside a 0.43 Tesla field.
7. Low sensitivity to mechanical deformations: a 200 \(\mu\)m change in the anode to cathode distance changes the gain by less than 20%.
8. High accuracy construction: since the accuracy depends on the quality of the printed circuit board used for readout.
9. Moderate construction costs: \(\sim\)600 CHF/m\({}^{2}\) for materials.

## 2 Performance as a position measuring device

Tests have been performed with a charged pion beam using two small chambers equipped with 2 mm readout strips. By comparing the positions obtained in each of them through weighting the charge distribution, the position resolution of the device was determined to be 150 \(\mu\)m (Figure 1).

Also the two track separation capability was checked by an offline analysis as follows: the pulse height distributions from two different particle interactions are distribution is analyzed by a specially designed algorithm which essentially fits the distribution with a double peak structure. The result is shown in Figure 2, where the reconstructed separation is plotted against the measured one. It can be seen that a 2 mm particle separation reconstruction is achieved.

These two characteristics, together with the high rate capabilities of the device, makes this chamber a possible candidate for the muon tracker in the large rapidity region.

## 3 Capability as a trigger device

Due to its operational characteristics in a saturated mode, thin gap chambers provide a timing signal with a small time jitter. A large (\(1.2\times 0.8\)m\({}^{2}\)) chamber was scanned with a Ru source, where the trigger (start signal) was provided by an outside scintillator. The typical time jitter obtained is shown in Figure 3. It can be seen that it shows an RMS of 5 ns and it is all contained within a 20 ns time interval. Distributions obtained at various points in the detector show the same characteristics. The maximal variation of the peak positions obtained was less than 3 ns, which is consistent with the expectations of the signal propagation along the length of the detector (1.2 m length).

By attaching two such devices, one can eliminate the dead area due to wire support. This can also improve the timing resolution, e.g. by staggering the two layers by half a cell. This can provide a fully efficient trigger device for the ATLAS muon system. By arranging the directions of the strips, the chamber can provide measurements of the second coordinate as well as a bunch crossing identification and a high \(p_{t}\) track trigger.
