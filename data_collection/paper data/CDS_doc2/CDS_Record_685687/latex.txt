Introduction

The design of the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter and preshower detector presented in the ATLAS Letter of Intent [1] was based on studies carried out by the RD3 Collaboration, and consisted of a liquid argon (LAr) accordion calorimeter preceded by a separate liquid argon preshower with two active layers.

Since then a large effort was devoted, in the Liquid Argon community, to the optimization of the EM calorimeter and preshower layout, with the aim of achieving the best performance in ATLAS. The main lines of this study can be summarized as follows:

* reduction of the passive material in front of the EM calorimeter.
* optimization of the accordion geometry (structure of the absorber plates, length of the folds).
* another solution for the preshower detector, first proposed by the GEM Collaboration [2, 3], was investigated. In this approach the first sampling of the EM calorimeter is segmented in narrow strips and therefore acts as an "integrated" preshower device.
* the use of liquid krypton (LKr) as an active medium for the barrel EM calorimeter has been considered. Krypton would allow for better sampling and noise terms of the energy resolution than argon thanks to its shorter radiation length. Owing mainly to cost arguments, it has only been studied for the option with integrated preshower.

The various investigated options have been implemented in a complete GEANT simulation of the ATLAS detector and each of them has been optimized within realistic mechanical constraints. Their merits have then been compared on several critical performance issues - energy resolution, accuracy in position and angular measurements, \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation capability, detection of low-energy electrons - and balanced with arguments of cost and ease of the mechanics and electronics.

These optimization studies led to the choice of a "hybrid" solution, where an independent active layer, installed in the liquid right after the cryostat cold wall, is used as a presampler, and the first sampling of the accordion is segmented in narrow strips (integrated preshower). The task of the presampler is to recover the energy lost in the upstream material and to contribute to the measurement of the shower direction in \(\eta\). The fine-grained first sampling is needed for \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation and for the reconstruction of the shower direction in \(\eta\). This design was adopted in the Technical Proposal (TP, [4]) for the barrel EM calorimeter (\(|\eta|<1.4\)), being the best compromise in terms of cost, low complexity and performance. In the end-cap (\(1.4<|\eta|<3.2\)), owing to the limited amount of material in front of the calorimeter and to the larger shower energy for a given \(p_{T}\), a dedicated presampler layer was found not to be necessary.

Further studies are needed before a choice of the liquid (argon or krypton) for the barrel calorimeter can be made.

Four ATLAS notes summarize the optimization work, illustrate the main features of the various options and compare in detail their performance. This paper, the first of the series, describes the models (Section 2) and presents results on the energy resolution of the EM calorimeter for the various layouts (Section 4 and 5). The position and angular measurements are discussed in [5], the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation capability in [6] and the identification of low-\(p_{T}\) electrons from b decays in [7].

## 2 Description of the models

The layout of the various options has been implemented in the general GEANT simulation of the ATLAS detector, which also includes a precise description of the accordion geometry. All dimensions, thicknesses and materials are described in detail in [8]. Here we only recall the salient features.

### Inner detector

The model of inner detector used in the simulation is a previous version ("Panel layout"), which differs only marginally from the layout described in the TP. The total material for this model is shown in Fig. 1.

### Cryostats and coil

The present cryostats are described in detail in the TP. The simulation follows closely the engineering design. In the barrel the cryostat is identical for the separate and the integrated preshower option in case of argon. For krypton the radial thickness of the cold wall is increased (as mentioned in the TP), but the outer dimensions of the cryostat are unchanged.

The main changes brought by the optimization studies to the LoI design were driven by the need of reducing the passive material in front of the EM calorimeter:

* the barrel cryostat is now fully in aluminium. The external cold wall was in stainless steel and it is now in solid aluminium. The internal cold wall consisted of 27 mm of aluminium plus 2 mm of stainless steel (total thickness 0.41 \(X_{0}\) at \(\eta=0\)) and it is now an aluminium honeycomb sandwich (0.09 \(X_{0}\) at \(\eta=0\)).
* the coil length was reduced from 6.2 m to 5.3 m to improve the energy resolution in the region between the barrel and the end-cap EM calorimeters. The study of the coil structure was taken over by the KEK group which, although using a different technique than that initially proposed by Saclay, reached the same conclusions about the coil thickness in radiation lengths.
* the end-cap cryostat is now also fully in aluminium. Furthermore the front walls lean onto each other through epoxy bumpers, allowing for a minimal thickness.

### Model with a separate preshower

Starting from the internal cold wall of the cryostat, the detector layout is the following (by increasing radius):

* preshower lead layer 1. This layer is tapered with rapidity, to provide a total of 2 \(X_{0}\) of passive material (inner detector included) before the first active layer 1. Therefore at the end of the barrel and in the transition region between barrel and end-cap (\(1.2<|\eta|<1.8\)), where the material in the tracker, coil and cryostat already reaches 2 \(X_{0}\), the lead layer is removed. Footnote 1: In case of a separate preshower detector, a significant amount of passive material in front of the active layers is needed to produce photon conversion, and therefore to achieve an efficient \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation. Test beam results [9] have demonstrated that the best compromise between \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation and energy resolution requirements is to have about 2 \(X_{0}\) (3 \(X_{0}\)) in front of the first (second) active layer.
* preshower active layer 2 (\(\eta\) view). The thickness is the same as in the \(\phi\) layer and the granularity is \(\Delta\phi=0.025\times 4\), \(\Delta\eta=0.025/8\).
* EM calorimeter electronics. It has a thickness of 30 mm and is a CH2/LAr mixture (50/50).
* accordion. The radial space available for the active calorimeter is 435 mm.
* calorimeter supports. The space needed for the supports of the barrel calorimeter inside the cryostat is included in the simulation. However the support rings are modelized by a uniform cylinder of the same total mass.

Figure 2 shows the material distribution in front of the preshower and EM calorimeter as a function of rapidity.

### Model with an integrated preshower and a presampler (TP model)

Starting from the internal cold wall of the cryostat, the detector layout is the following (by increasing radius):

* presampler layer. The total thickness is 31 mm, the active LAr (or LKr) 10 mm. The granularity is \(\Delta\phi=0.025\times 4\), \(\Delta\eta=0.025/8\) for \(|\eta|>0.8\) and \(\Delta\phi=0.025\times 4\), \(\Delta\eta=0.025\) for \(|\eta|<0.8\)[5].
* calorimeter electronics. With argon: it is a CH2/argon mixture (50/50) of thickness 40 mm (more than in the separate preshower case due to the more complex electronic connections). With krypton: it is a CH2/krypton mixture (70/30) of thickness 20 mm. Due to the short radiation length of krypton (4.8 cm), the thickness of this layer was found to be critical for the energy resolution, especially at the end of the barrel. The space taken for connections and electronics was therefore reduced by adopting the 0T readout scheme for the first sampling of the calorimeter (as explained in the TP).
* accordion. The radial space available for the active calorimeter is 480 mm (more than in the separate preshower case owing to the absence of the \(\phi\) layer and lead layers of the preshower).
* calorimeter supports (as described in Section 2.3).

Figure 3 shows the material distribution as a function of rapidity for this model.

### Barrel EM calorimeter

The simulation describes the accordion geometry in full detail [10]. Following Ref. [11], and after many tests, it has been possible to implement in GEANT 3.21 a geometry with the full 2\(\pi\) barrel accordion calorimeter, including more than 60000 volumes, with a reasonable memory size and computing time (1.2 sec/GeV on a HP735 station).

#### 2.5.1 Absorbers

In all models there are 1024 absorbers. Their folds have angles varying with radius so as to keep the LAr gap constant with depth.

The number of folds is 12 for the model with separate preshower and 13 for the model with integrated preshower (thanks to the larger available radial space). The minimal total thickness traversed by particles from the interaction centre to the end of the active accordion part is 26.5 \(X_{0}\).

The \(\phi\) amplitude of the folds is about \(4\cdot 2\pi/1024\) ("N=4"), which means that each fold of a given absorber plate overlaps with four following plates. The precise value of this overlap was tuned to minimize the calorimeter response variation with the particle impact point in \(\phi\).

The absorber plate is a sandwich with a lead central core and two 0.2 mm thick skins of stainless steel, glued to the lead by glass-fiber-reinforced epoxy. At large rapidity the thickness of the absorber plates, as seen from the vertex, increases, thus producing a decrease of the calorimeter sampling frequency and a deterioration of the sampling term of the energy resolution. To compensate for this effect, the sampling fraction of the detector is increased by reducing the thickness (in radiation lengths) of the absorber. Therefore the overall thickness of the converter plates is kept constant with rapidity, but the amount of lead is reduced for \(|\eta|>0.9\) (\(|\eta|>0.6\) for the model with krypton) and replaced by epoxy. This was found to provide a better energy resolution than a previous solution, used for a RD3 prototype, in which the missing lead was compensated with more steel. The optimized Pb thicknesses for the different models are:

- separate preshower with argon: \(1.85\) mm (\(|\eta|<0.9\)) and \(1.2\) mm (\(0.9<|\eta|<1.4\)).
- integrated preshower with argon: \(1.8\) mm (\(|\eta|<0.9\)) and \(1.2\) mm (\(0.9<|\eta|<1.4\)). The difference with the previous case comes from the larger available radial space.
- integrated preshower with krypton: \(1.4\) mm (\(|\eta|<0.6\)) and \(1.0\) mm (\(|\eta|>0.6\)). The lead sheets are thinner because of the shorter radiation length of krypton, but not thinner than \(1.0\) mm for reasons of mechanical rigidity.

The lead thickness, in each case, is dictated by the constraint to have enough radiation lengths in the space available for the EM calorimeter. With more radial space, thinner lead plates could be used to the advantage of the sampling term of the energy resolution.

#### 2.5.2 Readout electrodes

The EM calorimeter has three longitudinal compartments. In the separate preshower model, the compartment thicknesses are constant in radius and correspond to 8.6, 8.0, 7.7 \(X_{0}\) respectively at \(\eta=0\). In the integrated preshower model, the first compartment is tapered with \(\eta\), resulting at all rapidities in a constant thickness of \(4.5\)\(X_{0}\) along a trajectory coming from the interaction centre 2. This allows to improve the measurement of the shower \(\phi\) position in the second sampling, which is needed in case of an integrated preshower with \(\eta\) strips [5]. In the integrated preshower model, the boundary between the second and third sampling is at fixed radius, as in the separate preshower case. The thickness of the last two samplings is 10.1 and 9.6 \(X_{0}\) respectively at \(\eta=0\).

Footnote 2: Some studies of \(\pi^{0}\) rejection have also been done with a first compartment of 5.5 \(X_{0}\)[6].

The nominal transverse granularity of the accordion calorimeter is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.025\), obtained in \(\phi\) by grouping four kapton electrodes in the same readoutchannel, and in \(\eta\) by etching cells on the kapton boards. For all models the second sampling has this transverse granularity, while in the third sampling cells are grouped by two in \(\eta\). In the separate preshower model the first sampling has the nominal granularity.

In the integrated preshower model the first sampling is divided into narrow strips. There are two possibilities for the strip geometry: "\(\eta\)-strips" (as in the GEM calorimeter) and "\(UV\)-strips" [12]. In the first case all electrodes have the same narrow division in \(\eta\), that is 0.025/8. These strips are then grouped by 16 in \(\phi\) to give an effective readout granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.003\times 0.1\). In the second case, \(U\) or \(V\) strips are drawn on even or odd electrodes respectively. In the simulation the (curved) strips are approximated by straight segments. Strips belonging to eight consecutive even (odd) electrodes are grouped to make a \(U\) (\(V\)) readout strip. The stereo angle is 90\({}^{\circ}\), hence \(U\) (\(V\)) strips make a \(+45^{\circ}\) (\(-45^{\circ}\)) angle with the \(z\)-axis, as seen from the vertex. The width of the \(U\) or \(V\) strips is 0.025/4. At \(\eta=0\) the physical size of these strips is \(\sqrt{2}\) times longer and \(\sqrt{2}\) times wider than \(\eta\)-strips. Since there are two views (\(U\) and \(V\)) the number of channels is the same for the \(UV\) and \(\eta\)-strip model.

In the simulation, the charge induced by each hit on the neighbouring strips is computed taking into account the distance of the hit to the strip and its position in the gap.

For the whole accordion, the software is available to compute completely the current induced on the electrodes by the ionization electrons, including the electric field map, the drift velocity, the yield dependence on the field, and the transfer function of the shaping electronics. For the time being, this complex part of the code has only been used to check that the energy resolution with full charge collection is very close to the results obtained by considering only the energy deposited in the liquid. In a model without passive material in front of the EM calorimeter, the sampling term with full charge collection was found to be a factor \(1+(0.05\pm 0.05)\) larger than without charge collection.

### End-cap EM calorimeter

The end-cap calorimeter was implemented in the simulation in a simplified way. Instead of the accordion geometry, a model with parallel plates, perpendicular to the beam direction, was used. The software exists to simulate in detail the accordion geometry in the end-cap, and has been used to optimize the detector in its own right. However this code has not yet been implemented in the general ATLAS simulation program.

As for the barrel calorimeter there are two models for the end-cap, one with separate preshower and one with strips in the first sampling (without presampler). In the latter case only the \(\eta\)-strip option has been considered so far.

Energy reconstruction

### Cluster size

The size and shape of the cluster of cells needed to reconstruct the energy of electrons and photons result from a compromise :

* the contribution of the electronics and pile-up noise to the energy resolution increases with the cluster size, typically like the square root of its area.
* incomplete containment of the shower induces fluctuations and therefore deterioration of the sampling term. In the calorimeter alone more than 95% of the shower energy would be contained in a cluster of 3\(\times\)3 cells (with cell size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.025\)). In the ATLAS environment, particle interactions in the inner detector (conversions for photons, bremsstrahlung for electrons) in the presence of a 2 T magnetic field tend to open the shower in \(\phi\), thus significantly reducing the containment. This led to the choice of asymmetric clusters, larger in \(\phi\) than in \(\eta\).

Figure 4 shows the low energy tails produced by incomplete containment of the electron shower, while Fig. 5 gives the total energy resolution, including the sampling term, the constant term, electronics and pile-up noise, as a function of rapidity. In both figures the results obtained with different cluster sizes are compared. From Fig. 5 it can be seen that the energy resolution is similar for a \(3\times 7\) cell cluster (in \(\eta\times\phi\)) and a \(3\times 5\) cluster. However Fig. 4 shows larger tails for a \(3\times 5\) cluster than for \(3\times 7\) cells, especially at the beginning of the end-cap calorimeter where the tracker material approaches its maximum. Therefore a \(3\times 7\) cell cluster has been chosen for these studies and for the physics analyses presented in the TP.

The remaining losses outside this cluster are mainly in the \(\eta\) direction. They depend on the particle impact position with respect to the cell centre (see Fig. 6) and can be easily corrected for with a parabolic parametrization.

### Calibration

For each model, a set of calibration constants has been determined to reconstruct the energy of the incident particles. Suitable weights are applied to the energy deposited in the active liquid of the calorimeter and of the preshower (or presampler). In the separate preshower model three weights are needed, one for the calorimeter and two for the two preshower layers. For the hybrid option, only two weights are used, one for the calorimeter and one for the presampler 3. These calibration coefficients, which depend on the rapidity but not on the energy of the shower over the investigatedrange, were determined with electrons of \(E_{T}\)=40 GeV incident at different values of \(\eta\). In all cases the shower energy was reconstructed in a \(3\times 7\) cell cluster. Figure 7 shows that after this calibration procedure a good linearity is obtained down to very low energy.

## 4 Optimization results

In this Section we present a set of results which justify the main choices made in the optimization of the calorimeter, cryostat and coil design.

Figure 8 shows the variation of the calorimeter response in \(\phi\) with the chosen "N=4" geometry (see Section 2.5.1). The amplitude of this modulation, which can be parametrized and corrected, is \(\pm\)0.5% peak-to-peak with an r.m.s. of 0.3%. This represents an improvement with respect to test beam results obtained with a large scale accordion prototype, built with an "N=3" geometry, which showed a peak-to-peak modulation of 1% with r.m.s. 0.5% [13].

Figure 9 shows the difference between two possible solutions for the converter, one in which the reduced amount of lead in the absorber plates at large rapidity is compensated by steel, the other one in which it is compensated by epoxy (in these models the lead thickness was changed twice, at \(\eta=0.356\) and \(\eta=1.01\)). These results suggested to replace the lead with epoxy.

In case of an integrated preshower without presampler, as in the GEM detector, the energy lost in the passive material in front of the calorimeter can be recovered, to some extent, by means of the so called "massless gap". This is a few centimetre deep radial region, just at the beginning of the active calorimeter, where the lead in the absorber plates is replaced by light material (like G10). The energy released in the massless gap, which is correlated to the energy lost in the upstream material, is read out together with the first sampling, therefore the massless gap can be made more effective by suitably weighting the signal from the first sampling. This solution, which was well adapted to the design of the GEM experiment, is not optimized for ATLAS, where the amount of dead material in front of the EM calorimeter is larger (mainly due to the coil) and the barrel calorimeter longer than in the GEM detector (so the passive material is seen at shallower incidence angles at the barrel ends).

The massless gap is part of the first sampling of the calorimeter by construction, therefore cannot be read out (and weighted) in dependently. In the case of a separate preshower, or with a presampler device, on the other hand, an independent weight can be applied to the layer located directly after the cryostat wall, which makes the correction for the energy losses more efficient especially at large rapidity4.

Footnote 4: In a previous model with integrated preshower but without presampler the massless gap thickness was optimized for the best energy resolution. In the present model with an independent presampler, the massless gap has been kept, but its optimum thickness has not been reoptimized.

Figure 10 shows the resolution obtained in the ATLAS EM calorimeter for an integrated preshower geometry with and without a presampler. One can also see the benefit of the reduced thickness of the cryostat cold wall with respect to the

LoI design, and the effect of the change in the lead thickness at \(\eta=0.9\). The performance of a model with the TP cryostat and without presampler is discussed in Ref. [14].

With the coil size proposed in the ATLAS LoI, particles produced at rapidities between 1.45 and 1.7 had to cross the coil and six cryostat walls before entering the end-cap calorimeter, which caused a strong degradation of the energy resolution in this region. Figure 11 shows how this degradation has been reduced by shortening the coil. This at the expense of a small decrease of the field bending power in the inner detector at small angles. With this new geometry the "crack" between barrel and end-cap EM calorimeter, that is the region where the upstream dead material is larger than 3 \(X_{0}\), is reduced to the rapidity range \(\eta\)=1.45-1.53 (see also Fig. 2).

## 5 Energy resolution

### Sampling fluctuations

Figure 12 and 13 show the electron energy distributions reconstructed at \(\eta=0.3\) and \(\eta=1.3\) and at various \(E_{T}\) for the TP model. Low energy tails are visible below 10 GeV at central rapidity values and up to 80 GeV at the end of the barrel. Although the accuracy of the energy measurement is reduced at low \(E_{T}\), electrons can be detected to as low as \(E_{T}\)=2 GeV, as demonstrated in [7].

The energy resolution obtained by fitting the gaussian part of the energy spectra is shown in Fig. 14 as a function of rapidity for transverse energies between 2 and 80 GeV. The deterioration with rapidity is mainly due to the increasing amount of material in front of the calorimeter.

Figure 15 gives a quantitative estimation of the low energy tails as a function of \(E_{T}\) and rapidity. The trend with \(\eta\) follows closely the material distribution in the inner detector depicted in Fig. 1.

The sampling terms obtained with the separate preshower model and the TP model for \(E_{T}\)=40 GeV electrons and photons are compared in Fig. 16 and 17. Figure 16 shows that in the end-cap the resolution with the TP model (integrated strips without presampler) is close to the intrinsic calorimeter resolution measured with test beam data, indicating that a presampler device is not needed in this region. The slightly better result with the TP layout than with the separate preshower is due to the smaller amount of material in front of the calorimeter, both in the barrel and in the end-caps. It can also be seen that the resolution is better for photons than for electrons. This is because the photon showers start later than the electron showers and are therefore less hurt by the passive material.

A comparison of the performance obtained in the barrel with different active liquids is shown in Fig. 18 and 19 for the baseline TP model. It can be seen that in the central part of the barrel, krypton would allow to improve the sampling term to about \(7\%/\sqrt{E}\). At the end of the barrel this term deteriorates to almost the same level as with argon, due to the increase of the effective absorber thickness and to the larger amount of upstream material.

An additional contribution to the sampling fluctuations can come from longitudinal shower leakage behind the EM calorimeter. In all models considered so far, the minimum thickness of the accordion is 26.5 \(X_{0}\) (\(\eta\)=0), including also the material in front of the active part. This ensures good shower containment at the highest energies, as demonstrated in Fig. 20 which shows the reconstructed energy distribution for electrons of \(E_{T}\)=500 GeV at \(\eta\) = 0.3 with krypton. The resolution of 0.38% is well below the expected constant term (0.7%). We have also investigated the case of filling with argon a calorimeter optimized for krypton (therefore with thinner lead plates) as a temporary backup solution in the event, for example, of a major pollution of krypton, which would take some time to recover for. In this case the minimum thickness of the EM calorimeter would be only 22.5 \(X_{0}\) (at \(\eta\)=0) and some leakages could occur at high energy. However this effect can be limited by suitably weighting the energy deposited in the third sampling of the EM calorimeter and by collecting the energy in the hadronic calorimeter behind. Figure 21 shows that the energy resolution for electrons of \(E_{T}\)= 500 GeV would be 0.8%. This value, which was obtained without using the information of the hadronic calorimeter, is still acceptable 5.

Footnote 5: A word of caution is needed at this point. Recently an error has been found in GEANT in the pair production cross-section, which affects the electromagnetic shower simulation above 100 GeV [15]. Therefore the longitudinal shower leakage will have to be reconsidered after fixing this problem.

### Total resolution

The other terms, beside the sampling fluctuations, which contribute to the energy resolution have also been evaluated. These are:

* the constant term. The estimation presented in the TP is based on test beam results obtained with a 2 m size accordion prototype, and on the use of \(Z^{0}\) events for further equalization of the various calorimeter modules [16]. The expected figure is 0.7%.
* the electronic noise. The values of noise per calorimeter cell have been given in the TP for the various compartments. The contribution to an electromagnetic shower (\(3\times 7\) cell cluster) scales as 270 MeV/\(sin\theta\) in the barrel. In the end-cap it decreases from 530 MeV at \(\eta\) = 1.4 to 115 MeV at \(\eta\) = 3.2. With krypton the noise in the barrel is a factor 1.6 smaller, as explained in the TP.
* the pile-up noise. It has been evaluated by overlapping fully simulated minimum-bias events with the correct bunch-crossing structure and by including the response of the shaping electronics [17]. With the chosen shaping time \(t_{p}(\delta)=20\) ns, the r.m.s. of the pile-up energy seen in a \(3\times 7\) cell cluster amounts to 320\(\mbox{MeV}/\sin\theta\) at the design luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). For delicate physics studies presented in the TP, such as the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel, pile-up events have been added to the signal.

As an example the total energy resolution obtained by adding the sampling term, the constant term, the electronic noise and pile-up terms described above is shown in Figs. 22 and 23 for photons of \(E_{T}\!=\!50\) GeV in case of an argon and a krypton calorimeter respectively. For krypton a shaping time \(t_{p}(\delta)=17\) ns, which minimizes the quadratic sum of the pile-up and electronic noise, has been used.
