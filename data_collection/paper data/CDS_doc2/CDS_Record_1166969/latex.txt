###### Abstract

An accurate determination of the top quark pair production cross-section at the LHC provides a valuable check of the Standard Model. Given the high statistics which will be available, corresponding to about one top-quark pair per second, at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), the cross-section measurement can be performed relatively fast after the turnon of the LHC. Prospects for measuring the total top quark pair production cross-section with the ATLAS detector during the initial period of LHC are presented in this note. The cross-section is determined in the semi-leptonic channel, and in the dilepton channel. For the semi-leptonic channel we perform the measurement both with and without relying on the tagging of b-quark initiated jets.

The determination of the top quark pair production cross section is one of the measurements that will be carried out once the first data samples are available at the ATLAS experiment. It casts light on the intrinsic properties of the top quark and its electroweak interactions. Cross section measurements are also an important test of possible new production mechanism, as non Standard Model top quark production can lead to a significant increase of the cross section. New physics may also modify the cross section times branching ratio differently in various decay channels, as for example predicted by Supersymmetric models [1] with charged Higgs particles, \(t\to H^{-}\bar{b}\), or with super-partners of the top quark, \(t\rightarrow\tilde{t}\chi_{0}\). The selection of top quark events is based on the identification of a jet from a b-quark, assuming a branching ratio \(BR(t\to Wb)=1\). The consistency of this assumption, performed with kinematic methods, is another important check of the Standard Model prediction but falls outside the scope of this paper.

Last but not least, the top pair production process will be valuable for the in-situ calibration of the ATLAS detector during the commissioning phase. The large cross section and the large signal to background ratio for the semileptonic channel, allows to identify high purity samples with large statistics in a short period of time. Understanding the experimental signatures of top events involves most parts of the ATLAS detector and is essential for claiming discoveries of new physics.

The cross-section values and the Monte Carlo samples which have been used throughout this note, are described in [9].

#### 1.0.1 Cross section measurements at Tevatron

During Tevatron Run I (1992-1996) an integrated luminosity of about 100 pb\({}^{-1}\)at a centre of mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=1.8\) TeV allowed to measure top pair production cross sections of \(6.5^{+1.7}_{-1.4}\) pb and \(5.7\pm 1.6\) pb by the CDF and DO collaborations respectively [2]. The Tevatron Run II started in 2001 and until spring 2006 about 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(p\bar{p}\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=1.96\) TeV have been collected and analysed. At this higher centre of mass energy an increase of about 30% in the cross section is expected. The most recent calculations predict a cross section of \(6.7^{+0.7}_{-0.9}\) pb [3] at NLO+NLL or \(6.8\pm 0.6\) pb [4] at NLO+ threshold resummation for a top mass, \(m_{t}=175\) GeV. CDF and DO measured a combined channels cross-section equal to 7.3\(\pm\)0.5(stat) \(\pm\)0.6(sys)\(\pm\)0.4(lum) [5] and 7.4\(\pm\)0.5(stat)\(\pm\)0.6(sys)\(\pm\)0.4(lum) [6] respectively. All the measurements are in good agreement with the predictions. From a combination of all results, an experimental error of the order of the theoretical error is expected.

## 2 Single lepton channel

In this section the strategy for the determination of the \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section in the semi-leptonic decay mode is described. This channel, which has a branching fraction of approximately 45%, has a clear signature, is experimentally easily accessible and is expected not to suffer from large backgrounds.

A robust analysis is presented of the first 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) ATLAS data, which are expected to be collected during the first few months of the LHC data taking period. In particular it is studied whether a pure \(t\bar{t}\) sample can be identified without utilizing the full ATLAS b-tagging capabilities. This is brought about by the fact that efficient tagging of jets originated from the hadronization of b-quarks, called b-tagging from now on, is non trivial and implies a precise alignment of the inner detector, which will probably require several months of data taking. This analysis solely relies on the measurement of jets, leptons and \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) (transverse missing energy), and requires a functioning lepton triggering system. Thanks to the over-constrained kinematics of the \(t\bar{t}\) system, with the selected events it will be possible to measure the b-tagging performance and the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), as well as to calibrate the light jet energy scale.

### Event selection

The identification of semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events starts by requiring a highest level (event filter) lepton trigger to have fired. In this study we assume that either the single isolated electron trigger e22 or the muon trigger mu20 (for the definition see [7]) has fired. A correct description of the trigger efficiencies is vital for the cross-section determination. The strategy for determining the trigger efficiencies from the Monte Carlo, as well as from the data without relying on Monte Carlo, is not pursued in this note, but included in [7].

Further, we define a candidate \(t\bar{t}\) event as having one reconstructed high-\(p_{T}\) isolated lepton (electron or muon), a minimal amount of missing energy and at least four reconstructed jets. The definition of electrons, muons and jets in our analysis has been discussed before.

For our default off-line selection the events are required to fulfil the following:

* One lepton (electron or muon) with \(p_{T}\)\(>\) 20.
* \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\ >\) 20.
* At least four jets with \(p_{T}\)\(>\) 20.
* Of which at least three jets with \(p_{T}\)\(>\) 40.

The fraction of events passing the individual selection requirements and the overall selection efficiency are shown in Table 1 for semi-leptonic events. In this table we split the efficiencies for semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events according to the \(W\) decay in the Monte Carlo generator: \(t\bar{t}\) (electron) where it decayed to an electron and a neutrino and \(t\bar{t}\) (muon) where it decayed to a muon and a neutrino.

We observe a combined efficiency for these requirements which is somewhat larger for the \(t\bar{t}\) (muon) events compared to the \(t\bar{t}\) (electron) events.

#### 2.1.1 Reconstructing \(t\bar{t}\) events

Before discussing additional requirements to improve the purity of the \(t\bar{t}\) event selection, we present the second step in the event reconstruction. In this step we test the events for compatibility with a \(t\bar{t}\) hypothesis. In the \(t\bar{t}\) candidates, three of the reconstructed jets are expected to form the hadronic top-quark. In the absence of b-tagging there is an additional ambiguity in choosing the correct three-jet combination among the reconstructed jets. We define our top-quark decay candidate as the three-jet combination of all jets that has the highest transverse momentum sum.

Fig. 1 (a) shows the reconstructed top mass for this selection (from now on referred as default selection) for the \(t\bar{t}\) sample. The top mass peak is clearly visible, and the tails of the distributions correspond to the combinatorial background.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c c c c c|c|} \hline  & Trigger & Lepton & \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) & Jet req. (I) & Jet req. (II) & Combined \\  & eff (\%) & eff (\%) & eff (\%) & eff (\%) & eff (\%) & eff (\%) \\ \hline \hline \(t\bar{t}\) (electron) & 52.9 & 52.0 & 91.0 & 70.7 & 61.9 & 18.2 \\ \(t\bar{t}\) (muon) & 59.9 & 68.7 & 91.6 & 65.5 & 57.3 & 23.6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Fraction of events passing the various selection criteria and the combined ‘default’ selection efficiency for semi-leptonic (electron and muon) analyses respectively. The statistical uncertainties on these numbers are negligible.

#### 2.1.2 Selection variations: I

Apart from the default event selection as described above, a number of additional criteria are defined to further increase the purity of the top sample. Here we improve on the simple \(t\bar{t}\) analysis by exploiting additional information: every three-jet combination that originates from a top decay also contains a two-jet combination that originates from a \(W\)-boson decay. To illustrate the presence of the \(W\)-boson we take the three jets that constitute the top quark, and select from the three combinations of di-jets the one that results in the highest value of the sum of the \(p_{T}\) of the two jets. The \(W\)-boson mass is then the invariant mass of the two jet system. In Fig. 2 (a) this mass distribution is shown for the electron analysis, and the \(W\)-boson mass peak around 80 GeV is clearly visible.

However we prefer an unbiased \(W\)-boson mass distribution in the analysis, for which we choose not to pick/define one particular \(W\)-boson di-jet pair out of the three combinations, but rather require that at least one of the three di-jet invariant masses is within 10 GeV of the reconstructed mass of the \(W\)-boson (taken as the peak value of the mass distribution of the \(W\)-boson candidates). This selection will be referred to as the \(W\)-boson mass constraint selection. The distribution of all three di-jet combinations in the top candidate is shown in Fig. 2 (b). Note that each event enters three times in this distribution. In this figure the background, as discussed in the next section, is already included.

The distribution of the three-jet invariant mass after the additional requirement that at least two jets are compatible with the mass of the \(W\)-boson is shown in Fig. 1 (b). This requirement shows a substantial reduction in the \(t\bar{t}\) combinatorial background compared to Fig. 1 (a). Notice that, compared to the default selection, the top mass peak becomes narrower and the tail of the distribution is reduced. However, the \(W\)-boson mass constraint also introduces a visible shoulder in the distribution which makes fitting to the data more subtle.

In Table 2 we show the fraction of \(t\bar{t}\) events that pass these various selection requirements.

#### 2.1.3 Background evaluation

We consider a number of background processes. The dominant expected background is \(W\)-boson+jets, but also single top production, \(Z\)-boson+jets and \(Wb\bar{b}\) are sizeable. Tables 3 and 4 summarise the expected numbers of signal and background events for the electron and muon analysis respectively. The first column of the two tables shows the event numbers obtained by applying the default selection, whilst the second column gives the corresponding numbers with the \(W\)-boson mass constraint. All numbers

are normalised to 100 pb\({}^{-1}\). The evaluation of the QCD fake rate deserves a separate discussion. The QCD production of \(pp\to b\bar{b}\) is characterised by a cross-section of about 100 \(\mu\)b, and can therefore be an important background for our signal. Requiring the presence of a high \(p_{T}\) lepton and missing energy can reduce its contribution, but since the cross-section enhancement relative to the signal is so large, there might be QCD events with a fake lepton and/or poor missing energy reconstruction that pass these requirements as well.

The rate for extra (medium [8]) electrons is studied and found to be roughly 1.0 \(\times 10^{-3}\) per jet. This number is divided between semi-leptonic \(B(D)\) decays and true fakes, i.e. hadronic objects identified as electrons. The origin of extra isolated muons is dominated by semi-leptonic \(B\) decays, i.e. by the presence of hard b-quarks. The isolated muon rate per b-parton reaches a few times \(10^{-3}\) for b-parton momenta around 40 GeV, while the fake rate is only a few times \(10^{-5}\). By studying their origin and dependence on jet/parton kinematics like the \(p_{T}\), \(\eta\), jet multiplicity and quark content of the jet, we can get an estimate of the fraction of multi-jet events that will pass the lepton requirement in the event selection. The validity of this approach has been checked using a large sample of di-jet events at various transverse momenta.

The first three rows correspond to the single-lepton final states, the fourth row to the di-lepton final state and the last row to the hadronic final state.

As a result, the QCD background has been evaluated to be smaller than the \(W\)-boson\(+\)jets background and will not be discussed further.

The distribution of the invariant mass of the three-jet combination that forms the hadronic top-quark candidate with the default selection and with the backgrounds added together, is shown in Fig. 3 (a). The events where the correct jets were selected to reconstruct the hadronically decaying top quark candidate are clearly visible as the mass peak (open histogram) on top of a smooth background distribution. This background is partially composed of events from non-top processes (light shaded histogram), but is dominated by the (combinatorial) background from semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\)  events (dark shaded histogram). The combinatorial background was determined using the matching of the top candidate with the generated top-quark in a cone of size \(\Delta R<0.2\).

In Fig. 3 (b) the reconstructed three-jet mass after the \(W\)-boson mass constraint is presented. The background is also shown.

Table 3 and 4 show the number of signal and background events in a 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) data sample. To give an indication of the signal purity in the top mass peak region, in the third column of Tables 3 and 4 we give the number of events in a hadronic top mass region: \(141<m_{t}<189\) GeV. Although not all signal events are correctly reconstructed, in both the electron and muon analyses the purity of the signal in the top mass window is close to 80%.

#### 2.1.4 Selection variations: II

Additional ways to kinematically select top events other than the \(W\)-boson mass constraint, or to improve the signal purity after having applied the \(W\)-boson mass cut itself, were explored. In the commissioning phase, it can happen that the barrel calorimetry will be better calibrated than the forward one. Therefore, it can be useful to apply the additional request that the three highest \(p_{T}\) jets are all at \(|\eta|<1\). The reconstructed top mass in this case is shown in Fig. 4.

The centrality requirement applied after the default selection allows to reach the same signal-over

Other variables were exploited as well, like the \(\cos\theta^{*}\)2) and the total invariant mass of the event. In the following no cuts on these variables are used in the analysis.

### Determination of the cross-section

In this section two complementary methods to determine the \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section of the commissioning analysis are presented. The first method estimates the \(t\bar{t}\) signal by performing a maximum likelihood fit on the three-jet invariant mass distribution. The second is based solely on counting the number of top candidate events that pass the selection, and subtracting all backgrounds in order to get the yield of \(t\bar{t}\) events in the sample. The two methods are affected by different systematics. Whereas this counting method needs all backgrounds to be properly addressed and normalised, it does not rely on a correct reconstruction of the top quark. The peak-fit method is rather insensitive to background normalisation and efficiencies, but requires a fairly well understood top mass peak.

#### 2.2.1 Likelihood fit method

To extract the number of completely reconstructed \(t\bar{t}\) events (after having applied the default \(+\)\(W\)-boson mass constraint selection) a maximum likelihood fit is performed to the three-jet mass distribution with a Gaussian signal on top of the background described by a Chebychev polynomial, see Fig. 5. It has been verified that the background model correctly describes the combined \(t\bar{t}\) combinatorial and background distribution in the signal region by comparing the fitted background to the subset of events that are not fully reconstructed signal as determined from truth matching information.

Using 10000 pseudo-experiments, based on the input from the full simulation Monte Carlo events, one can extract the average fraction of signal events that pass all selection requirements and enter in the peak (i.e., the fraction correctly reconstructed). The average number of events in the peak in the muon analysis, i.e. correctly reconstructed semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) (muon) events, in 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) is 508 events as shown in Fig. 5 (a). This corresponds to an efficiency of (4.23 \(\pm\) 0.57)%. For the electron analysis this efficiency is (2.73 \(\pm\) 0.47)%.

The signal significance is defined using the likelihood ratio from two hypotheses: the presence of a signal (a peak) and its absence (only the Chebychev polynomial). The amount of data needed to make a statistically significant observation of the \(t\bar{t}\) signal depends on the amount of background. For low luminosities, for example for 25 pb\({}^{-1}\), the sampling fluctuations are too large and there is no typical plot like the one of Fig. 3. To quantify the relation between signal significance, luminosity and the

Figure 4: (a): Reconstructed top mass after \(W\)-boson mass constraint for the electron analysis. The white area represents the \(t\bar{t}\) signal in the electron channel, while the three shaded areas corresponds, going from the lighter to the darker, to the background from \(W\)-boson+jets, single top and all the other background sources considered in the analysis. The distribution is normalised to 100 pb\({}^{-1}\). (b): The same distribution, but in addition requiring that the three highest \(p_{T}\) jets are at \(|\eta|\)\(<\)1.

amount of background, 10000 pseudo-experiments based on the full simulation distribution of the three-jet mass as a function of the integrated luminosity, have been modelled and fitted. The expected statistical significance is shown in Fig. 5 (b), where the yellow band is obtained by assuming the nominal level of QCD \(W\)-boson\(+\)jets background, while the red one refers to the case when this background is multiplied by two.

To go from a fitted number of properly reconstructed hadronic top quarks to a cross-section, one needs to correct for the event selection efficiency and the hadronic top reconstruction efficiency. The statistical error is estimated from having simulated 100000 pseudo-experiments, applying the fluctuations which are expected in 100 pb\({}^{-1}\)to both signal and background and fitting the peak in both the electron and muon channels.

One of the biggest uncertainties is the correct modelling of the jet multiplicity distribution as it affects the fraction of \(t\bar{t}\) signal events that are correctly reconstructed using the algorithm described earlier. An overview of the systematic uncertainties is given in [9].

#### 2.2.2 Counting method

The \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section can be obtained by performing a counting experiment:

\[\sigma=\frac{N_{\rm sig}}{\mathcal{L}\times\epsilon}=\frac{N_{\rm obs}-N_{\rm bkg }}{\mathcal{L}\times\epsilon}\]

\(N_{\rm bkg}\), the number of background events estimated from Monte Carlo simulations and/or data samples, is subtracted from \(N_{\rm obs}\), the number of observed events meeting the selection criteria of a top-event signature. This difference is divided by the integrated luminosity \(\mathcal{L}\) and the total efficiency \(\epsilon\). The latter includes the geometrical acceptance, the trigger efficiency and the event selection efficiency, and is slightly dependent on \(m_{t}\). The advantage of using event counts in the commissioning phase is that, early on, the Monte Carlo simulations may not predict the shapes of distributions very well.

In order to perform the counting experiment the Monte Carlo samples were divided into two, statistically independent: one which represents real data, used to obtain \(N_{obs}\) and the other one used as a Monte Carlo to obtain both \(\epsilon\) and \(N_{bkg}\).

Figure 5: (a): Fit to the top signal. The Chebychev polynomial fit to the background is indicated by the dotted line and the Gaussian fit of the signal events is indicated by the full line. (b): Distribution of the expected statistical significance of the top signal in the peak as a function of the integrated luminosity for two background scenarios. The yellow band is obtained by assuming the nominal level of QCD \(W\)-boson\(+\)jets background, while the red one by assuming that this background is doubled.

#### 2.2.3 Systematic uncertainties

The main sources of systematic uncertainties are described in [9]. Some relevant points for the analyses presented here are discussed for the case of the default selection plus the \(W\)-boson mass constraint. The systematic uncertainty on the cross-section due to the luminosity determination, is factorised and mentioned as a separate uncertainty on the overall results. The event selection efficiencies have a nearly linear dependency for jet energy scale variations, which affects the counting method directly. The hadronic top reconstruction efficiency has an inverse dependence on the jet energy scale, caused by the algorithm that picks the three-jet combination that are considered to be the hadronic top. If the jet energy scale is lowered, the jet multiplicity (and therefore the number of three-jet combinations) increases. The probability that the algorithm picks the right combination generally decreases with the number of combinations to choose from.

The effect of ISR and FSR parameter variations (chosen in such a way to maximise the effect on the cross-section measurement) has been evaluated. For the uncertainties related to the PDFs, both the uncertainty coming from CTEQ and MRST, have been considered and the largest one (coming from CTEQ) has been used for the final systematics evaluation.

The main systematics uncertainties for the two analysis are listed in Table 5.

For the likelihood method a 5% change in jet energy scale causes a 2.3% (0.9%) change in the combined reconstruction efficiency for the electron (muon) channel. The different jet multiplicity distributions affect not only the event selection efficiencies (jet requirements), but also the overall efficiency of the hadronic top reconstruction algorithm. A comparison between the two generators mc@nlo and alpgen has been made to study these systematic effects. alpgen predicts 7% and 4% larger selection efficiencies in the electron and muon channels respectively. For the overall efficiencies the values are 10.5% and 4.7% larger in the electron and muon channel. However, these numbers were not added in the final result since there is overlap with the ISR/FSR systematics. Systematics effects on the shape of the fit as well as the normalisation of the peak fit w.r.t. background is estimated with toy Monte Carlo's. Deviations of 14.0 (10.4)% for the electron (muon) channel are found, while the effect of changing the fit-ranges is negligible.

For the counting analysis the uncertainty arising from the Monte Carlo used to generate the signal process has been taken into account as well. This has been done by comparing the cross-section obtained applying the same analysis to \(t\bar{t}\) events generated with mc@nlo and with the acermc Monte Carlo.

#### 2.2.4 Contributions of new physics

Many models of physics beyond the Standard Model contain new particles which couple to top-quarks. For example, in a supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (SUSY) these new particles are top squarks [10] and in warped extra dimensions they are Kaluza-Klein resonances [11]. Since the new particles are expected around the TeV scale, the typical cross-sections are of order a few pico barns and hence one can expect a few hundreds new physics events in the first 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data. In principle, these new physics events could represent a significant background to the cross-section measurement. For new physics models with much lower masses, e.g. low mass supersymmetry models, there will be many more events: this case will be considered later on. Here the existence of a new particle \(V\) which decays only into \(t\bar{t}\) pairs, \(V\to t\bar{t}\) it is assumed. It is further assumed that this particle has a production cross-section of 5 pb, so that 25/9 pb is the cross-section for the non-fully hadronic decays of \(V\). As a model for \(V\) a 1 TeV Z\({}^{\prime}\) is used. The efficiency for these events with respect to the default selection \(+\) the \(W\)-boson mass constraint is roughly twice the one obtained for Standard Model \(t\bar{t}\) events, and the number of events passing the selection will be of the order of 1% or less of the \(t\bar{t}\) events. Hence the new particle \(V\) will not affect the cross-section determination significantly.

The predictions at several mSUGRA benchmark points [12] have been studied as well. The results are shown in Table 6 and demonstrate that the expected signals are small. At specific parameter points however, like SU4 [12], the cross-section is sizeable and the event topology is similar to that from top quark pairs which results in additional backgrounds as large as the total Standard Model background. In Fig. 6 one can see that the shape of the SU4 supersymmetry signal in the top quark candidate three-jet invariant mass distribution is very similar to that from the Standard Model background.

The separation of \(t\bar{t}\) events and these new physics signals is addressed in more detail in [12], dedicated to searches for supersymmetry.

### Implementation of b-tagging

The possibility to identify b-flavoured jets (b-tagging) will improve the signal to background ratio of the selection. The b-tagging requirements are described in [9]. The number of "tagged" b-jets in the \(t\bar{t}\), single top and \(W\)-boson+jet events which pass the default selection is shown in Fig. 7.

Tables 3 and 4 list the number of \(t\bar{t}\) and background events in the electron and muon channel which survive the default selection plus the \(W\)-boson mass constraint, and the request of having one and only one, or two and only two b-jets (column six and seven). For all these cases, the corresponding signal to background ratios are given. Requiring one or two b-tagged jets improves the purity of the sample by more than a factor of four, while the signal efficiency is only reduced by a factor of two.

In Fig. 8 the reconstructed three-jet mass is shown when one or two b-tagged jets are required for the default selection (a) and for the default selection \(+\) the \(W\)-boson mass constraint (b). To reconstruct the top mass, we find the three-jet combination with the highest possible \(p_{T}\), obtained by requiring that one and only one of the three jets is a b-jet. The \(W\)-boson mass constraint can then be applied to the two jets which are not b-tagged (among the three). If the three-jet combination chosen above is such that the two

(b): Same distribution for the muon channel. The light histogram represents the Standard Model background. i.e. the background from mSUGRA point SU4 is shown separately.

non-b-jets don't combine to give a \(W\)-boson candidate, that event is rejected.

The statistical error on the cross-section which is obtained by requiring one or two b-tagged jets is 4.5%. The systematic error due to the jet energy scale is in this case of 4.9%, while a wrong normalization of the \(W\)-boson+jets background by a factor of 20%, 50% or even a factor two, brings a systematic error on the cross-section of 3.4%, 4.7% and 6.9% respectively. A 5% relative error on the b-tagging efficiency is expected from present studies for an efficiency of 50-60% and for a luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\). The resulting uncertainty on the cross-section turns out to be negligible. The uncertainty on the mistag rate is assumed to be of the order of 50%.

### Results

With the first 100 pb\({}^{-1}\)of data, we can observe a \(t\bar{t}\) signal and determine its production cross-section. This will be determined with a number of methods and we expect to reach the following accuracies (for the default selection with the \(W\)-boson mass constraint, using electron and muons):

\[\mathrm{Likelihood\ method} \tag{1}\] \[\mathrm{Counting\ method} \tag{2}\]

### Differential cross-sections

We studied several differential distributions for \(t\bar{t}\) production. First, we present the momentum and rapidity distribution of the hadronically decaying top quarks, after having applied the default selection and the \(W\)-boson mass constraint. The results are shown in Fig. 9 (a) and (b).

A more detailed study has been performed for the differential cross-section as a function of the \(t\bar{t}\) system mass, and for several double differential distributions as shown in the following sections.

The differential cross-section for \(t\bar{t}\) production can be measured as a function of the invariant mass of the \(t\bar{t}\) system in the semi-leptonic channel (with no tau leptons in the final state). Such a measurement provides an important check of the Standard Model and, at the same time, deviations from the \(t\bar{t}\) continuum could indicate the presence of new physics, for example new heavy resonances decaying into a \(t\bar{t}\) pair [14].

Figure 8: (a): Reconstructed three-jet mass for \(t\bar{t}\), single top and \(W\)-boson + jet events for the default electron selection, requiring one or two jets tagged as coming from a b-quark. (b): Same distribution for the default selection + the \(W\)-boson mass constraint and requiring one or two jets tagged as coming from a b-quark.

The standard commissioning selection is applied and the momenta of the four jets with highest \(p_{T}\), the lepton and the best estimate of the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) vector are used as inputs to a least squares fit with the constraints that, in each event, the masses of both the \(W\)-boson and top-quark are consistent with 80.4 GeV and 175 GeV respectively. The fit procedure is documented in [15]. The goal is to improve the measurement of the reconstructed final state particles' four vectors by incorporating the precise knowledge of the masses of the \(W\)-boson boson and the top-quark. No b-tagging is used in this analysis and hence there are 12 possible combinations to assign jets to the (anti-) top. All combinations were investigated and and one was chosen: the assignment which returned the smallest weighted sum of squared residuals obtained from the kinematic fit. A simpler reconstruction scheme obtains the \(t\bar{t}\) mass by deriving the leptonic \(W\)-boson momentum from the lepton and missing energy momenta with the \(W\)-boson mass constraint and then combining it with the momenta of the four highest \(p_{T}\) jets.

The reconstructed mass distributions for the two methods are compared to the true di-top mass distributions in Fig. 10 (a) for the non-hadronic signal. The true di-top mass distribution is in better agreement with the result obtained by making use of the full event fitting technique.

In this case, the expected mass resolution ranges from 5% to 9% between 200 and 850 GeV. A variable bin size of about twice the expected resolution is used to take such variation into account and reduce bin-to-bin migrations. The di-top mass spectrum (\({\rm d}N/{\rm d}m_{\rm u}\)), reconstructed with the full event fit, is shown in Fig. 10 (b) for the signal and the backgrounds studied. Backgrounds include: full hadronic top, single top, \(W\)-boson\(+\)jets, \(Wb\bar{b}\), \(Wc\bar{c}\), inclusive \(Z\)-boson to leptons. The contribution from the di-boson (\(WW\),\(WZ\) and \(ZZ\)) backgrounds is negligible.

#### 2.5.1 Double differential cross-section as function of \(p_{T}\) and \(y\)

The double differential cross-section for \(t\bar{t}\) production is sensitive to possible new physics beyond the Standard Model, e.g. extra dimensions based on studies of the top quark spin correlation [13], which depends on the knowledge of the top quark's momentum. A measurement investigates the decay products of the top quark in its rest frame and therefore good knowledge of its \(p_{T}\) and \(y\) as defined in (3), for a top quark of energy \(E\) and longitudinal momentum \(p_{z}\), is needed.

\[y=\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(\frac{E+p_{z}}{E-p_{z}}\right) \tag{3}\]

Figure 9: (a): Momentum distribution of the reconstructed three-jet mass for \(t\bar{t}\), single top and \(W\)-boson\(+\)jet events for the electron analysis. (b): Rapidity distribution of the hadronically decaying top quark.

Theoretical predictions can be found in [4]. Here we present a feasibility study which, since the neutrino momentum cannot be directly measured, concentrates on the reconstruction of the hadronically decaying top quark in semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events. Since in this case a high purity is needed, the default event selection is tightened by requiring exactly two b-tagged jets. The reconstruction of the hadronic top quark proceeds as follows: all possible combinations of two non-b-tagged jets with 60 GeV\(<\) m\({}_{jj}<\) 100 GeV are selected as \(W\)-boson candidates. The nearest b-tagged jet for every \(W\)-boson candidate is found. The combination with the highest transverse vector sum momentum is then taken as the reconstructed hadronic top quark. This results in a purity of well reconstructed top quarks of 45%. The main background is due to combinatorics.

Figure 11 shows the reconstructed double-differential distribution of the hadronic top scaled to an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). In (a) the truth distribution of the \(t\bar{t}\) signal is presented, while in (b) the distribution of reconstructed hadronic top-quarks is shown. In this distribution the contribution of background (from single top, \(W\)-boson + jet, \(Wb\bar{b}\) and \(Wc\bar{c}\)), which is very small after the requirement of two b-tagged jets, has been added. After such a selection, the number of expected events limits the

region of interest to \(|y|<2\) and 50 GeV\(<p_{T}<\) 280 GeV. 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) is a reasonable statistic which allows to fill a significant number of bins with an appropriate statistical error. A lower integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) would increase the statistical error of the bin contents at the edge of the interesting area from 10% to approximately 30%, which would limit the measurement to a smaller phase-space. The systematic uncertainties of this feasibility study are expected to be small and under control.

The potential to determine the double differential cross-section of \(t\bar{t}\) events decaying semileptonically has been estimated. The phase space can be determined with an average efficiency of \(3.98\pm 0.04\%\) and a peak efficiency of 8% near the central rapidity region and for \(p_{T}\leq 140\) GeV.

The main systematic uncertainties for this study will come from the jet energy scale and from the initial and final state radiation: each source contributing with an uncertainty of the order of \(\pm\) 15% in the central region.

## 3 Di-Lepton channel

In this section the determination of the \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section where both \(W\)-bosons decay leptonically is presented. This measurement depends crucially on the correct identification of leptons. We proceed by investigating the channel with two electrons, one electron and a muon, and two muons in the final state. Final states with tau leptons are not studied here. The determination of the cross-sections is performed with a simple 'cut and count' method, a template method and a likelihood fit.

### Event selection

The di-lepton sample is expected to be triggered with high efficiency using a combination of single-lepton and di-lepton triggers [7]. The overall trigger efficiency for the electron-muon channel is (\(97\pm 1\))%, for the two electron channel it is (\(98\pm 1\))% and for the two muon channel it is (\(96\pm 1\))%. Due to the trigger OR condition between the channels and the high statistics available for efficiency measurements, the uncertainty is small.

The offline selection of di-lepton events is based on the identification of leptons as described in the introductory section. Two high-\(p_{T}\)opposite signed leptons, i.e. two electrons, two muons, or one electron and one muon, are required. These requirements define the preselection sample and additional selection criteria are imposed depending upon the \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section extraction method. The expected number of events produced after the preselection cuts of two isolated opposite charged leptons is shown in Table 7. None of the selections makes use of b-tagging.

#### 3.1.1 Lepton identification and isolation

The inclusive di-lepton selection requires at least one of the electrons to be identified with the 'tight-electron' algorithm3 to improve the fake lepton rejection.

Footnote 3: The tight-electron algorithm makes full use of the TRT information as described in Ref. [16].

One of the major backgrounds in this channel is given by semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events where the second lepton candidate is faked by a jet. A requirement on the isolation of the electrons lowers this background substantially. Fig. 12 (a) shows the distribution of the variable \(\Sigma_{\Delta R<0.2}E_{T}\), defined to be the energy deposited in a hollow cone with radius \(\Delta R\) of 0.2 around the electron candidate. The figure shows this variable for reconstructed electrons in the semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) background sample which are close to a monte carlo truth electron (\(\Delta R<0.1\) to a truth electron from the \(W\)-boson decay) and for reconstructed electrons with \(\Delta R>0.1\). With the requirement \(\Sigma_{\Delta R<0.2}E_{T}\)\(<6\) GeV, the signal is reduced by only \(\sim 4\%\) whereas the semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) background is reduced by a factor of two.

Two cuts are used to select muons from \(W\)-boson decays while simultaneously rejecting muons from b-jets. The first cut selects the muon candidate with tracks in the muon spectrometer that match best with tracks in the inner detector. Additionally it is required that the muon is not closer than \(\Delta R<0.2\) to a jet, otherwise the muon is removed.

Fig. 12 (b) shows the distance of muons to the closest jet in the event. Muons that are close (\(\Delta R<0.2\)) to a monte carlo truth b-quark are separated from muons that are close to a monte carlo truth muon (\(\Delta R<0.1\)). A \(\Delta R\) cut of 0.2 removes the muons that do not originate from the \(W\)-boson decay. This requirement reduces the semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) background by \(\sim 25\%\), whereas the signal is reduced by only 0.8%.

### Backgrounds

The backgrounds to the \(t\bar{t}\) di-lepton signal can be classified into two main categories: prompt leptons originating from an electroweak decay, or non-isolated non-prompt leptons and jets that are falsely identified as leptons mainly originating from QCD jets.

For the estimation of the electroweak backgrounds we use Monte Carlo samples, as shown in Table 7. For the same-flavour Drell-Yan processes we made an exception, as the size of this contamination depends on the determination of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) which is difficult to model. As a default we use the shape of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution for events with a di-lepton mass inside a window around the \(Z\)-boson mass, to correct the shape of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution in the Monte Carlo. The same correction factor is used for Drell-Yan processes with di-lepton invariant masses outside the \(Z\)-boson mass window.

The backgrounds from fake leptons are estimated from the QCD dijet samples. These estimations of fake leptons are subsequently applied to all objects that can lead to fake leptons (e.g. jets) in the inclusive single electron or muon samples.

### Cross-section measurement

As mentioned, three methods to determine the cross-section for the di-lepton channel are presented. The di-lepton channel profits from having smaller backgrounds and systematics and the methods are complementary to each other. The robust 'cut and count' method can be replaced with the more sophisticated template and likelihood method with increased accumulated data.

#### 3.3.1 'Cut and count' method

A 'cut and count' analysis is the most straightforward method to determine the cross-section. It can be used as the basis and reference for the more elaborate likelihood methods and act as a cross check between the different approaches.

The selection criteria are defined to maximise the efficiency \(\epsilon\) and the purity \(p\) at the same time. The figure of merit is the product

\[\epsilon\times p\propto\frac{S}{\sqrt{S+B}}=s\]

which is referred to as significance.

The variables that best characterise the signal events are the transverse momenta of the two leptons and the two jets, as well as the missing transverse energy. The jet momenta are high since they originate from the b-quarks, not present in the prominent background processes \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) or dibosons \(\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) (\(WW\), \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\)). A large amount of missing transverse energy is expected in signal events due to the two escaping neutrinos. In addition a veto on events with a di-lepton invariant mass around the \(Z\)-boson mass is applied. Fig. 13 (a) shows the di-lepton mass distribution in \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) events. Most of the events are found to have an invariant mass between 85 and 95 \(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). In the case of the \(Z\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) events the peak is shifted and broadened, since the visible leptons do not come directly from the \(Z\)-boson. Also the neutrinos from the \(\tau\) decay add to the missing transverse energy. It is therefore expected that this background will be dominant, although the branching ratio for both \(\tau\)'s decaying leptonically is only \(\sim 9\%\). The optimal selection was found from a multidimensional scan of the significance \(s\). Exactly two leptons are required and at least two jets. The requirements on the lepton and jet transverse momenta and on the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is then varied from 20 to 60 \(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). Finally, the cuts with the maximum significance are used to evaluate the cut and count performance.

As a result, the multidimensional scan indicates that the values of the preselection requirement of 20 \(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) for the two leptons and for the two jets with the highest transverse momentum already maximise the significance. One additional cut is imposed: the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is required to be at least 30 \(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) for a selection oftwo leptons (all sub-channels together), at least 20 GeV for the \(e\mu\) decay channel and at least 35 GeV for the same flavour lepton channels. The distribution of the missing transverse momentum for the signal and the background samples is presented in Fig. 13 (b). The efficiencies, signal over background ratios and the significance for an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Table 8.

The cross-section is derived from:

\[\sigma=\frac{N_{\rm sig}}{\mathcal{L}\times\epsilon}=\frac{N_{\rm obs}-N_{\rm bkg }}{\mathcal{L}\times\epsilon}\]

To evaluate the statistical uncertainty on \(\sigma\), the error on \(N_{\rm obs}\) is taken to be Gaussian assuming it will be measured in the data. The error on \(N_{\rm bkg}\) is calculated here from Monte Carlo and scaled to the desired

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l r r r r|} \hline dataset & \(e\,\mu\) & \(ee\) & \(\mu\,\mu\) & all channels \\ \hline \hline \(t\bar{t}\) (di-lepton) & 555 & 202 & 253 & 987 \\ \(\epsilon\) [\%] & 6.22 & 2.26 & 2.83 & 11.05 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) (semi-leptonic) & 24 & 11 & 4 & 39 \\ \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) & 0.0 & 9 & 0.0 & 20 \\ \(Z\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & 5 & 0 & 51 & 79 \\ \(Z\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) & 17 & 4 & 6 & 25 \\ \(W\,W\) & 6 & 2 & 2 & 10 \\ \(ZZ\) & 0 & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.9 \\ \(W\,Z\) & 1 & 0.6 & 1 & 3 \\ \(W\to e\nu_{e}\) & 7 & 7 & 0.0 & 14 \\ \(W\rightarrow\mu\nu_{\mu}\) & 25 & 0.0 & 7 & 33 \\ single top \(Wt\) & 0.7 & 0.5 & 0.0 & 1 \\ single top s-chann. & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.1 \\ single top t-chann. & 2 & 0.8 & 1 & 4 \\ \hline Total bkg. & 86 & 36 & 73 & 228 \\ \(S/B\) & 6.3 & 5.6 & 3.4 & 4.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

luminosity. The relative error on the efficiency \(\epsilon\) (the product of geometrical acceptance and selection efficiency) here is also calculated from the Monte Carlo. The expected statistical error on the cross-section measurements for different integrated luminosities is given in Table 9. In data the efficiencies regarding leptons will be estimated from \(Z\) data events using tag and probe. Also the rates of backgrounds containing misidentified leptons can only be measured in data reliably.

#### 3.3.2 Inclusive template method

The inclusive template method is based on the observation that the three dominant sources of isolated leptons which can be selected in the \(e\mu\) channel are \(t\bar{t}\), \(WW\) and \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\). However, these three processes can be separated looking at the two-dimensional plane spanned by \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) and number of jets, as shown in Fig. 14.

Table 7 shows that there might be instrumental effects that introduce non-prompt non-isolated or falsely identified leptons, primarily in single \(W\)-boson and Drell-Yan decays to muons. These non-prompt non-isolated or falsely identified leptons can weaken the separation of the templates if their contribution is too large. To reduce this effect we add a 'tight-electron' requirement on one of the electrons. Signal sensitivity and robustness against systematic uncertainties are improved by adding also the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels. In the \(\mu\mu\) channel we reject events where the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) is aligned along any of the reconstructed muons. To further reduce the Drell-Yan background in the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels a \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>35\) GeV cut and a Z-veto are added in those channels. The estimated number of events remaining after these additional background rejection cuts are shown in Table 10.

By constructing normalised 2D templates for each channel we determine the relative size of the \(t\bar{t}\), \(WW\) and \(Z\rightarrow\tau\tau\) contribution by performing a binned log likelihood fit to pseudo-experiments. To ensure a fit with a pull distribution compatible with a Gaussian with zero mean and unit sigma we relax the template likelihood using nuisance parameters constrained to their expected

eters are: common acceptance and common background normalization for each final state. Bias from potential new physics is avoided by adding one free parameter with an associated orthogonal background template. Orthogonal in this context means that an additional background template does not introduce a bias when only SM events are present in the pseudo-experiments. The fit has in total ten free parameters including the \(t\bar{t}\), \(WW\) and \(Z\to\tau\tau\) cross-sections.

Many different configurations of background templates are scanned and the template with the highest probability is selected. For robustness, the fit is first performed in the \(e\mu\) channel, and then the fitted parameters are fed as start values into the full fit which includes all channels: \(e\mu\), \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\). The result from the full fit applied to pseudo-experiments including all systematics is shown in Fig. 15.

Systematic uncertainties enter in two ways: in the acceptance of the two leptons, and in the shapes of the 2D templates exemplified in Fig. 14. The impact of the systematic uncertainties is estimated using pseudo-experiments where all uncertainties and correlations, as discussed in section 3.4, are included, except the luminosity. Note that the acceptance is by definition not affected by the jet energy scale, but has a 2% uncertainty from QCD showering. The shape has a 2% uncertainty from QCD initial state showering, and 2% from the jet energy scale. QCD final state showering only comes from \(t\bar{t}\) and is found not to have any measurable effects on the fit when all channels are included. The projected significance versus integrated luminosity including all systematic uncertainties, except luminosity, is shown in Fig. 15.

#### 3.3.3 Likelihood method

The likelihood method uses the following log-likelihood function to extract the parameters \(N_{\rm sig}\) and \(N_{\rm bkg}\) given the fixed total number of events \(N_{\rm tot}\) and the measurements (\(x_{i}\)):

\[L=-\sum_{i=1}^{N_{\rm tot}}\ln(G[x_{i}|N_{\rm sig},N_{\rm bkg}])+N_{\rm tot}\]

with

\[G(x)=N_{\rm sig}\times S(x)+N_{\rm bkg}\times B(x)\]

The multidimensional function \(G(x)\) is the sum of the functions \(S(x)\) which describes the signal distribution and of \(B(x)\) that describes the background distribution. The functions are determined by

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r r r|} \hline Sample & \(e\mu\) & \(ee\) & \(\mu\mu\) \\ \hline \hline \(t\bar{t}\) (di-lepton) & 516 & 213 & 178 \\ \(t\bar{t}\) (semi-leptonic) & 12 & 11 & 2 \\ \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) & 3 & 9 & 0 \\ \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) & 9 & 0 & 18 \\ \(Z\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) & 151 & 10 & 2 \\ \(W\to e\nu\) & 35 & 28 & 0 \\ \(W\to\mu\nu\) & 11 & 0 & 11 \\ \(WW\) & 57 & 17 & 19 \\ \(WZ\) & 5 & 3 & 2 \\ \(ZZ\) & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ single top & 3 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

fitting Chebychev polynomials to the signal and background Monte Carlo distributions after the cut and count cuts were applied in the variables \(|\Delta\varphi(\mathrm{lepton}_{0},E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})|\) (\(\Delta\varphi\) between the highest \(p_{T}\) lepton and the missing transverse energy vector) and \(|\Delta\varphi|(\mathrm{jet}_{0},E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}})|\) (\(\Delta\varphi\) between the highest \(p_{T}\) jet and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) vector). Fig. 16 shows one of the distributions and the solid line shows the fits to the distribution that are used as \(S(x)\) and \(B(x)\).

The sum of the semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\), \(Z\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) and \(WW\) events are considered as background and added up according to their cross-section to produce one single background distribution.

To estimate the error on the cross-section, ensemble tests were performed for different integrated luminosities ranging from 10 pb\({}^{-1}\)to 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). The relative statistical errors are presented in Table 11.

### Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties have been evaluated according to the standard prescription [9]. In particular, the lepton ID efficiency will be measured from data using \(Z\)-boson events and the uncertainty is expected to be of the order 1%. The lepton trigger efficiency will be measured from data using \(Z\) events with an uncertainty which should also be of the order 1%. The lepton fake rate uncertainty is estimated from dijet events, and during the initial phase of data taking we expect this uncertainty to be of the order of 50%. The systematic effect due to the uncertainty of the jet energy scale is investigated by scaling the

reconstructed jet energies by \(\pm 5\%\). The value of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is rescaled accordingly. The initial and final state radiation was investigated and the results are summarised in Table 12 as well.

For the likelihood, the fit parameters of the Chebychev polynomials were varied by 1 \(\sigma\) at the same time in the same direction. The results can be seen in Table 12.

The reweighting technique, to assess the systematic uncertainties from parton densities is also described in Section [9]. To cross-check the technique ATLFAST samples with different PDFs were used. For the cut and count method the efficiency using MRST PDFs is larger than the efficiency using CTEQ PDFs. Table 12 summarises the changes in the selection efficiency. For the cut and count analysis this directly translates into an uncertainty on the cross-section determination. For the likelihood method the reweighted events were used to fit the \(N_{\mathrm{sig}}\) and \(N_{\mathrm{bkg}}\) to the templates which were generated with the unmodified fully simulated events.

### Contribution of new physics

Many models of physics beyond the Standard Model can have a significant branching ratio to the di-lepton final state. In particular the 'cut and count' method is sensitive to these potential contributions. In some SUSY scenarios the contribution can be as large as one-third of the total \(t\bar{t}\) signal. This indicates how crucial it is to include all final states in order to verify the global consistency of the \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section. The template/likelihood methods are able to consider more distinctive \(t\bar{t}\) event properties and can be made much more robust against non-Standard Model sources.

Data-driven methods which consider the full kinematics of the di-lepton \(t\bar{t}\) system can further help

## 4 Discussion and outlook

In this note we have demonstrated that ATLAS will be able to reliably determine the \(t\bar{t}\) production cross-section already from the startup period of LHC. We have determined this cross-section for the \(t\bar{t}\) system decaying both into a single electron or muon with associated jets, or two electrons or muons with jets. For the single-lepton mode, we have investigated robust selection criteria that do not depend on the \(b\)-quark tagging. For the di-lepton channel various complementary channels have been investigated.

With only 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) of accumulated data, we have shown that we can observe the top-quark signal and measure its production cross-section. Various methods have been presented and the corresponding uncertainties studied. Apart from the luminosity uncertainty, the overall uncertainties are of the order of (5-10)% and are dominated by systematics. Consistency between the methods constrain contributions of new physics as they affect the various methods differently.
