Two major problems for most physics analyses in ATLAS are: (i) the equalization of response of different physical regions of the electromagnetic (EM) Calorimeter (intercalibration), and (ii) the correction of upstream material effects in energy reconstruction through extraction of the EM longitudinal weights. A possible solution to these problems consists of the in-situ calibration of the calorimeter using electrons from W\({}^{\pm}\) or Z\({}^{0}\)-boson decays. When electrons are used, intercalibration depends on longitudinal weights and vice versa, making it very hard to decouple the two effects in-situ. In this note we report on the development of a combined minimization method that provides simultaneous intercalibration and longitudinal weight extraction and can be used during the ATLAS data taking. It is shown that an intercalibration at the \(\simeq\)2ppm level, including upstream material effects and excluding the crack region, can be achieved under realistic conditions. A small degradation of the energy resolution is seen. One advantage of the combined method is the use of a single data sample. In this study event samples from the Data Challenge 2 (DC2) production were used to test the applicability of the method.

Introduction

The precise calibration of the ATLAS Calorimeter during the commissioning phase and during the actual data taking is an important issue for many physics analyses. Two of the most serious problems are:

* the equalization of response of different physical regions of the Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMC),
* the correction of (mostly) upstream material effects in energy reconstruction through application of longitudinal weights for the different samplings of the Liquid-Argon (LAr) EM Calorimeters.

These issues have been addressed in Technical Design Reports [1], [2], while understanding of the calorimeter response has been the main goal of several ATLAS LAr Calorimeter Test-Beams [3], [4], [5], [6]. In particular the most recent understanding of the linearity and resolution of the Barrel Calorimeter is reported in [7].

Recent attempts to extract the EMC longitudinal weights using electrons and applying them at the cluster level during the reconstruction stage in ATHENA have been quite successful [8], [9]. However, in the present ATLAS Monte Carlo simulation, the different regions of the EMC have responses independent of LAr purity and temperature variations, high voltage fluctuations, mechanical and electronics effects and other systematics which affect the resolution constant term. However, such effects will be present during data taking and any realistic calibration method must take them into account. Test-Beams provide crucial information concerning the so-called local constant term, which reflects the detector uniformity in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.4\) windows. Since in ATLAS there are 448 such regions, the equalization of their response must take place in-situ. To achieve the ATLAS requirement of a global constant term of \(\leq 0.7\%\), a uniformity of \(\leq 0.5\%\) in the response of each region and a uniformity of \(\leq 0.3\%\) among all regions is required. A number of EMC modules were found to satisfy the \(\leq 0.5\%\) requirement in ATLAS Test-Beams [3], [4], [5].

A recent attempt for intercalibration is reported in [10], where pp\(\rightarrow\)Z+X\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\)+X, Data Challenge 1 (DC1) samples without noise were used to extract known induced mis-intercalibration constants. The method was shown to achieve a 0.3% uniformity within two to three days of low luminosity running. However, it is clear that the extraction of the intercalibration constants is strongly coupled to the way the electron is reconstructed. In particular, the corrections for energy losses in the material upstream of the EMC, must also be determined from the data. Therefore, the intercalibration constants and the calibration factors for upstream material losses are expected to be better determined simultaneously.

In this note we report on the development of a combined minimization method that provides simultaneous intercalibration and longitudinal weight extraction and can be used during data taking. The method generalizes the pseudorapidity dependent weights to be also azimuth dependent. Our expectation is that mis-intercalibration effects are mostly absorbed in the overall energy scale weight.

The structure of the note is the following: an overview of the present corrections for clusters induced by electrons or photons (e/\(\gamma\)) is presented, followed by a description of the DC2 longitudinal weight extraction and its performance. Finally, an extension of the standard extraction method, which includes intercalibration, is presented, and its performance is studied with independent DC2 samples.

## 2 Overview of Cluster Level e/\(\gamma\) Corrections

The energy deposits of an electron or photon are stored in the cells of the EMC. These are then collected in clusters built around the cell including the shower barycenter in the middle compartment. The clusters are of variable size (\(3\times 3\), \(3\times 5\), \(3\times 7\), \(5\times 5\) in \(\Delta\eta=0.025\) and \(\Delta\phi=0.025\) bins). Corrections directly related to hardware variations or defects are applied to the cell energies. Examples are corrections accounting for the varying capacitance of the cells in the End-Cap module, and corrections for missing high voltage lines. Only few of these effects are presently included in the Monte Carlo simulation. In addition, average sampling fraction corrections are applied in order to produce an initial guess of the true deposited energy in the cell.

A number of cluster level e/\(\gamma\) corrections are applied during reconstruction in ATHENA. Such corrections are applied at the cluster level since they are particle type and/or clustering scheme dependent. The corrections implemented in ATHENA (release 9.0.0) are:

* S-shape correction: corrects the reconstructed position of an EM cluster along \(\eta\). Within a sampling the cluster position is the energy-weighted average of the positions of the cells included in the cluster. Due to the steeply falling lateral profile of the EM shower, the finite granularity of the calorimeter induces a systematic shift of the shower barycenter toward the center of the cell, effect known as S-shape. In the case of the ATLAS accordion calorimeter, this is especially true in the \(\eta\) direction, since in the \(\phi\) direction the accordion waves induce a better energy sharing between neighbouring cells.
* \(\phi\) Modulation: corrects the energy response as a function of the cell impact point in the \(\phi\)-direction. The variation of the cell energy response is caused by the varying amount of passive material crossed by an incident particle due to the accordion geometry.

* Offset in \(\phi\): corrects the cluster position along the \(\phi\)-direction for effects caused by the accordion shape of the cells and the shower depth. The position of a cluster in \(\phi\) is measured in the middle compartment.
* \(\eta\) Modulation: corrects the energy response as a function of the cell impact point along the \(\eta\)-direction.
* Out-of-cone correction: corrects the energy for finite lateral containment, thus taking into account the energy deposits which fall outside the clustering cone.
* Application of longitudinal weights: the ATLAS EMC is longitudinally segmented in up to four samplings. Thus, the reconstructed \(\mathrm{e}/\gamma\) energy is a function of the responses of the different samplings. The standard function (or parametrization) for the reconstructed energy is a simple weighted sum of the individual sampling responses. In the presence of \(\eta\)-dependent material thickness upstream of the EMC, the standard parametrization may need modification in order to preserve a good energy linearity and resolution. In that case the longitudinal weights become strongly correlated to the amount of upstream material [9]. A difficulty is that the weights are in principle particle-type dependent. Currently the longitudinal weights are extracted using electrons (see chapter 3). The extrapolation from the electron energy to the photon energy will be based on Monte Carlo simulation of the detector response, which has been extensively tested with Test-Beam data.

The impact of each one of these corrections has been studied using single electrons and photons using different clustering algorithms and schemes.

The longitudinal weight correction has been added as of the offline release 8.4.0. Currently a major revision of the longitudinal weight correction is planned, driven by recent results from Test-Beam data analyses [12]. In particular the out-of-cone corrections being strongly correlated to the weights will be absorbed in the overall scale weight. The back sampling weight, which is currently supposed to correct for longitudinal shower leakage, will be set to unity i.e. it will be calibrated to the same energy scale as the first and the second compartment. The longitudinal leakage will be calculated as a function of the mean shower depth. It has been shown in [7] that such a correction can be easily parametrized at a fixed \(\eta\) position and is independent of the incident particle energy. In addition new, more refined parametrizations, which include material effects between the strips and the presampler, may be added [12].

DC2 Longitudinal Weights

Starting from offline release version 8.4.0, the parametrization for the application of the EMC longitudinal weights in ATLAS reconstruction is:

\[E_{rec}=\lambda(b+W_{0}E_{pres}+E_{1}+E_{2}+W_{3}E_{3}) \tag{1}\]

where \(b\) is an offset with the units of energy, motivated by recent electron Test-Beam analyses. This offset was found to optimize simultaneously electron energy linearity and resolution. The weight \(W_{3}\) for the third sampling is supposed to be correcting for longitudinal leakage. For energies below 50 GeV, energy deposits in the back compartment are small leading to a noise dominated energy response [4]. Recent calibration studies [12], [7], suggest more effective parametrizations; the possibility of their implementation is presently under investigation.

The mean fractional energy deviation from truth (data points) and the energy resolution (error-bars) for electrons of energies 10, 20, 50 and 100 GeV before application of the longitudinal weights is shown in figure 1. The rest of the e/\(\gamma\) corrections have already been applied. It is clear that the average sampling fractions applied at the cell level (see section 2) provide only rough knowledge of the electron energy, and corrections for the upstream material are necessary. The default DC2 longitudinal weights in ATHENA were extracted using a sample of 400k electrons of energies 10, 20, 50 and 100 GeV (figure 2). For each energy, 1000 electrons were generated per \(\eta\) bin (\(\Delta\eta=0.025\)) for a total of 100 \(\eta\) bins (0\(\leq|\eta|\leq\)2.5). These samples contain realistic EMC noise response. However, there is no underlying event or physics pile-up events added. The weights were calculated for 5\(\times\)5 clusters (in middle compartment cell units). The longitudinal weights presented here were obtained by fitting electrons of known energy through minimization of the function: \(\sum\frac{(E_{rec}-E_{true})^{2}}{\sigma_{EM\,B}^{2}},\) where \(E_{rec}\) is the reconstructed energy, \(E_{true}\) is the true electron energy and \(\sigma_{EM\,B}\) is a calorimeter resolution parametrization. The minimization was performed in 100 \(\eta\) bins from \(\eta=0\) to \(\eta=2.5\) following the granularity of the middle sampling of the EMC (0.025 units in \(\eta\)). The resulting reconstructed energy and energy resolution for electrons of energies 10, 20, 50 and 100 GeV after application of the longitudinal weights is shown in figure 3. The energy is now correctly reconstructed for all energies in most of the \(\eta\) region. The improvement in the energy scale and resolution is shown in figure 4 for 50 GeV electrons. The initial \(-4\%\) shift in the reconstructed energy (upper-left plot) is corrected (lower-left plot). The RMS spread in the mean energy for all 100 \(\eta\) bins is also improved: the upper left plot has an RMS of 0.0081 and the lower left has an RMS of 0.0049. The tail in the lower-left plot comes from the fits in the crack region. The energy resolution per \(\eta\) bin is only slightly improved (right plots). For the central EM Barrel region a \(1.5-1.6\%\) resolution is found (most pronounced peak in the lower-right histogram). Recent EM Barrel Test-Beam analyses find a \(\simeq 1.5\%\) resolution but for 1 X0 of upstream material and 3\(\times\)3 cluster size [3]. The electron energy linearity integrated over the full \(|\eta|<2.5\) range is shown in figure 5. An overcorrection of 0.04% is seen for 10 GeV electron energy.

Lower plots: the corresponding plots after application of longitudinal weights. The energy is now correctly reconstructed and there is a significant improvement in the energy spread around the mean resolution: the upper left plot has an RMS of 0.0081 and the lower left an RMS of 0.0049. The tail in the lower-left plot comes from the fits in the crack region. The energy resolution per \(\eta\) bin is only slightly improved (upper-right and lower-right plots); in particular for the central EM Barrel region a \(1.5-1.6\%\) resolution is found.

The performance of the weights on events from simulated physics processes was studied using independent data samples. Here we present the Z\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) mass resolution from independent H\(\rightarrow\)4e,4\(\mu\),2e2\(\mu\) samples simulated with 8.0.5 and reconstructed with 8.7.0 by the DC2 validation teams (dc2.002896.pyt_h130_41 and dc2.002896.pyt_h180_41) 1. These samples include underlying event and realistic electronic noise simulation.

The Z\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) mass resolution before and after corrections for upstream material effects is shown in figure 6. Also, in this case the Z-boson mass is now correctly reconstructed and the width of the distribution is narrower. Clearly, improvement of electron and Z\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) reconstruction performance has an impact to several physics analyses in ATLAS.

## 4 Extraction of Longitudinal Weights including Intercalibration

The main goal of this note is to examine the possibility of extracting longitudinal weights which also account for intercalibration. This idea was triggered by the results of [10] where the simulation of the detector was mis-intercalibrated in bins of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.4\) regions of the EM Calorimeter, and Z\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) samples were used to determine the calibration factors \(\alpha\) which correct for this mis-intercalibration. A natural extension

Figure 5: Electron energy linearity after corrections for upstream material effects for 10, 20, 50 and 100 GeV electron energies. The markers denote the means of a Gaussian fit for \(|\eta|<2.5\) and the errorbar is the standard deviation of the fit.

of the method outlined in the previous chapter is to make the longitudinal weights also \(\phi\) dependent. The \(\phi\) bins are defined by the 448 intercalibration regions of the EMC. To test the method we inject a 5% mis-intercalibration at the cluster level (it must be ultimately done at the cell level) by multiplying the energy of all EM clusters by a scale-factor randomly drawn from a uniform distribution from 0.95 to 1.05, shown in figure 7. Clusters with (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) within a \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.4\) region of the EMC are scaled by the same factor. For reference the mean fractional energy deviation from truth (data points) and energy resolution (error-bars) for DC2 electrons for a mis-intercalated ATLAS EMC before any corrections for upstream material effects, is shown in figure 9.

The minimization method described in section 3 is used for \(\sim\)800 (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) bins. The usual 100 bins in \(\eta\) are kept and in addition a certain \(\phi\) segmentation is assumed. In the Barrel we have 16 \(\phi\) regions having size \(\Delta\phi=\)2\(\pi\)/16, which is the module size in the azimuth direction. The \(\Delta\eta\simeq\)0.2 is defined by the Front-End Board size. The obtained weights are shown in figure 8. In the upper left plot of figure 8, the scale weight was divided by the induced miscalibration factor. If the miscalibration factor is really absorbed in the overall scale then we should see little change in the divided scale and in the rest of the weights with respect to the ideal case of figure 2. From the plots in figure 8 we conclude that this is indeed the case with the exception of fluctuations coming from the limited statistics per bin.

The resulting mean fractional energy deviation from truth (data points) and energy

The Zs come from independent sample of H\(\rightarrow\)4e,4\(\mu\),2e2\(\mu\) simulated with 8.0.5 and reconstructed with 8.7.0 by the DC2 validation teams.

Figure 8: Longitudinal weights for 5\(\times\)5 clusters after a 5% miscalibration has been applied. The scale weight (upper left plot) was divided by the induced miscalibration. One must compare these plots (except for the \(W_{3}\) plot for which the errors are large) with the ones of figure 2. With the exception of a few \(\eta\) bins for which we had less statistics, for most fits the miscalibration factor is absorbed in the scale weight.

Figure 9: Mean fractional energy deviation from truth (data points) and energy resolution (error-bars) for DC2 electrons as a function of pseudorapidity for a mis-intercalated EM Calorimeter before any corrections for upstream material effects. The EMC was mis-calibrated by applying scale-factors to \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.4\) regions at the cluster level. The factors were drawn from a uniform distribution from 0.95 to 1.05.

resolution (error-bars) after the application of longitudinal weights which depend on the EMC physical region, thus including intercalibration effects, is shown in figure 10.

The distributions of the mean energy deviation from the true electron energy of 50 GeV and the energy resolutions are shown in figure 11. The upper plots show these distributions before any intercalibration or weighting. The lower left plot shows that uniformity is controlled at the \(\simeq\)2ppm level, when the tail which contains fit points coming from the Barrel End-Cap crack region is excluded. The lower right plot shows a resolution of \(\simeq 1.7\%\) in the central barrel region (most pronounced peak in the histogram).

For completion the performance of the weights on events from simulated physics processes is studied using independent data samples. Here we present again results using Z\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) from independent samples of H\(\rightarrow\)4e,4\(\mu\),2e2\(\mu\), simulated with 8.0.5 and reconstructed with 8.7.0 by the DC2 validation teams. The Z\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) mass resolution before and after application of the combined weights which include corrections for upstream material and intercalibration effects is shown in figure 12. The result of the combined method is rather encouraging given the relatively low statistics available per (\(\eta,\phi\)) bin

Figure 10: Mean fractional energy deviation from truth (data points) and energy resolution (error-bars) for DC2 electrons as a function of pseudorapidity after corrections for upstream material and intercalibration effects. The longitudinal weights are now EMC region dependent, thus absorbing any intercalibration effects.

Figure 11: Upper left plot: mean fractional energy deviation from truth for 50 GeV DC2 electrons for 100 \(\eta\) bins within \(|\eta|<2.5\) before intercalibration. Upper right: energy resolution (Gaussian \(\sigma\)) for DC2 electrons for 100 \(\eta\) bins within \(|\eta|<2.5\) before intercalibration. Lower plots: the corresponding plots after intercalibration. The combined method leads to an energy response uniformity controlled at the \(\simeq\)2ppm level, when the tail which contains fit points coming from the Barrel End-Cap crack region is excluded. The spread of the reconstructed energy around the mean is also significantly improved: the upper left plot has an RMS of 0.011, and the lower left plot has an RMS of 0.0047. An energy resolution of \(\simeq 1.7\%\) is found in the central Barrel region (most pronounced peak in the lower-right histogram).

(\(\simeq 200\) electrons per bin). A small over-correction is observed in the reconstructed mass, and the mass resolution (\(\sigma_{M}=0.021\pm 0.005\)) is slightly worse than in the ideal case of fig.6 (\(\sigma_{M}=0.018\pm 0.003\)). It should also be noted that the errors are relatively large. The deterioration of the resolution in figure 12 with respect to the one from figure 6 is not only coming from the reduced statistics but is also due to region boundary effects: clusters in the boundary of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) regions are corrected based on the cluster (\(\eta_{c}\),\(\phi_{c}\)) position, albeit a part of the cluster may belong to the neighboring region(s). These effects will be studied with higher statistics in the future.

## 5 Conclusions

In this note we reported on the development of a combined minimization method that provides simultaneous intercalibration and longitudinal weight extraction. The study performed here serves as a first step toward in-situ calibration. The method generalizes the pseudorapidity dependent weights to be also azimuth dependent. The performance of the combined method was studied using a mis-calibrated calorimeter with independent DC2 physics samples. It was shown that an intercalibration at the \(\simeq\)2ppm level, including upstream material effects and excluding the crack region, may be achieved using electrons. A reasonably good electron linearity and Z\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) resolution was found. The slight deterioration of the resolution is due to reduced statistics and \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) region boundary effects. An advantage of this method is the use of a single data sample.

Figure 12: DC2 Z\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) resolution before and after application of the combined weights which include corrections for upstream material and intercalibration effects. The Zs come from independent sample of H\(\rightarrow\)4e,4\(\mu\),2e2\(\mu\) simulated with 8.0.5 and reconstructed with 8.7.0 by the DC2 validation teams.

The results presented here also indicate that given good knowledge of the upstream material distribution in ATLAS, the longitudinal weights could be obtained by the Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment. Subsequently, intercalibration can be done with Z\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) in-situ to determine the overall scale factors as described in [10]. This approach simplifies the minimization procedure since only one factor per \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.4\) region must be determined.

Future studies may involve a second iteration where intercalibration corrections at the cell level are applied (depending on \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) regions) and weights are then recalculated, thus minimizing boundary effects. It is a necessary next step to test the method using Z\(\rightarrow\)e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) samples for the longitudinal weight extraction.
