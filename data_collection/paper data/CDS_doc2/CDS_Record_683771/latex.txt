We used a prototype set of high pressure monitored drift tubes and electronics at the M2 muon halo in the CERN North Area to study the effects of gas gain, threshold, and amplifier shaping time on resolution. As well as showing the results of the resolutions studies, we provide a detailed description of the gas amplification measurement and the signal threshold determination. We also discuss briefly our drift tube simulation, where the resolution as a function of drift distance was found to be in close agreement with this simulation.

Introduction

Determining the operating point of the MDT for the ATLAS muon system is a complicated process. Several parameters may be varied to provide the optimum performance, which include: gas gain, threshold value, and pulse shaping time. The first aspect of understanding the MDTs is to understand the intrinsic physics of the tube. The largest contributing factors to tube resolution are diffusion, Landau fluctuations and electronic noise.

In this note, we discuss briefly the impact of the operating point on monitored drift tube (MDT) performance, as well as giving the results of MDT resolution studies using a prototype set of tubes. We also describe our drift tube simulation and give a complete description of the gas amplification measurement and the threshold determination procedures.

The high radiation environment of the muon detector area also has a strong effect on the detector performance so that particle rates, aging, neutron flux etc, should be taken into account when the operating point of the MDT is chosen. To this end, the operating point might need to be shifted significantly from its low rate optimum. Lowering the gas gain is one example of such a compromise. Choosing a lower gas gain will improve the long term stability of MDT operation however at the same time slightly worsen resolution. In the end, resolution must be sacrificed to guarantee consistent performance of the MDT.

A series of data were taken in the M2 muon halo to look at the MDT position resolution at low gas gain operation (2*10\({}^{4}\) and 4*10\({}^{4}\)), and the results have been compared with an MC simulation.

## 2 Apparatus

### Monitored Drift Tube

The drift tube's cathode was an aluminum cylinder with an outer diameter of 3.0 cm and wall thickness of 500 \(\mu\)m 1.5 m in length. The anode wire was an enameled piece of tungsten, 50 \(\mu\)m in diameter located in the center of the tube. The endcaps were made of molded plastic and crimped to the ends.

Please refer to figure 1 which shows the setup in the experimental area, where there were 6 tubes oriented in parallel. This means that the wire position of adjacent tubes were separated by 3 cm. Two of the tubes were offset in the measurement direction by 1 mm. The tubes were numbered from 1 to 6, #1 being the most upstream. For these data, tubes #4 and #5 were not operational.

The electronics used in these tests were designed at Brookhaven and the drift tubes were built in the Boston area. The entire circuit consists of the drift tube with a 360\(\Omega\) terminating resistor, preamplifier, amplifier with shaper, discriminator and a single hit TDC. The preamplifier has a rise time of 2 nsec and a decay time of several \(\mu\)sec, therefore the preamp does very little to the shape of the signal. In this case, the shaping amplifier has the task of filtering the signal. These measurements were performed using shaping amplifiers with peaking times of 7.5 and 35 nsec, where this peaking time is defined as the time between the introduction of a square wave signal and the time where the signal is at its maximum voltage.

The gas used for these measurements was Argon 91%, N\({}_{2}\) 4%, Methane 5%, while the gas pressure was fixed at 3 atmospheres.

### Experimental setup

There were two sets of two planes of Cathode Strip Chambers (CSC) used as a reference system. The chamber's effective area is approximately 40 cm in the measurement direction (called \(y\)) and 30 cm in the strip direction (called \(x\)). Each plane of the CSCs gives a position resolution of approximately 60 \(\mu\)m. Formore details about the design and performance of the CSCs, please refer to [1].

The CSC planes were positioned approximately 1.4 m apart in the beam direction, \(z\). This setup gives a highly accurate measurement of muon track between the chambers in the \(y-z\) plane. The drift tubes were placed between the two sets of chambers; tube #1 was located 1.1 m behind the first chamber. This is shown in figure 1.

## 3 Calibration

### Gas amplification

The gas gain measurement was done using fluorescent 17.4 KeV photons produced by 60 KeV photons from an Am\({}^{241}\) source reacting in a 200 \(\mu\)m foil of Molybdenum to give a rather distinct line of 17.4 KeV photons. Figure 2 shows a sample ADC spectrum from this source that shows a central peak, as well as a broadband of lower energy photons from background reactions (various emission lines) and a broad peak of 60 KeV photons from the original Am\({}^{241}\) decay.

The charge on the anode wire was measured using a multichannel analyzer (QVT) in its charge sensing mode. For many high voltages, the peak position of the 17.4 KeV line was measured on the

Figure 2: Sample ADC spectrum from the Am\({}^{241}\)/Mo source where (a) indicates the background photons, (b) the central peak at 17.4 KeV and (c) shows the 60 KeV photons.

QVT. This position was then converted into real charge by inserting a fixed amount of charge on the input of preamplifier that gives the same position as the photon peak. This charge was injected by introducing a square wave with voltage \(U_{pulser}\) across a calibration capacitor \(C_{cal}\).

\[Q_{0}=C_{cal}/U_{pulser} \tag{3.1}\]

The fraction of the total charge collected for time \(t\) is,

\[\xi=\frac{Q(t)}{Q_{0}}=C\ln\left(1+\frac{t}{t_{0}}\right) \tag{3.2}\]

\[C=\frac{1}{ln\left(\frac{r_{a}}{r_{a}}\right)^{2}} \tag{3.3}\]

where \(t_{0}\) is characteristic counter time, \(r_{a}\) and \(r_{b}\) are the radii of the anode and cathode, respectively.

The charge was collected for a fixed interval of 10 \(\mu\)s. For the given tube geometry, C=0.0782, and for the gas mixture, \(t_{0}=11\) nsec. This gives the fraction of charge collected to be \(\xi=53\%\).

The gas gain can be calculated using the relation,

\[G.G.=\frac{Q}{e}\frac{w_{i}}{E_{\gamma}} \tag{3.4}\]

where \(Q\) is the collected charge, \(e=1.610^{-}19\)\(C\) is the electron charge, \(w_{i}=26\) eV is the energy for creating one ion pair in Argon and \(E_{\gamma}=17.4\) KeV is the photon energy.

For the gas Argon 91%, N2 4%, Methane 5%, the gain as a function of voltage is in figure 3.

### Threshold determination

The particular technique we used can only be done with an analog oscilloscope. Again, the Am\({}^{24}\)/Mo source was used. For this case, the background photons were very useful.

Figure 3: Gas gain versus anode voltage for Argon 91%, N2 4%, Methane 5%.

The signal amplitude was reduced by lowering the anode voltage, thus reducing the gas amplification by a factor of 10. In this case, the 17.4 KeV signal will be equivalent to 67 ionization electrons (i.e.). The analog signal from the shaper was split and connected to the inputs of an oscilloscope and a discriminator. The output of the discriminator was used as the scope's trigger.

The 17.4 KeV line was identified on the oscilloscope as a high intensity band of signals, with a peak voltage of \(V_{17.4KeV}\). There was also an almost continuous band of smaller, lower intensity signals due to the various lower energy emmision lines. At a lower voltage, there was an abrupt cutoff of signals; this defined the threshold voltage, \(V_{thres}\).

The threshold voltage can be converted into the number of ionization electrons by

\[T\,hr\,=\,\frac{E_{\gamma}}{10\,\,w_{i}}\frac{V_{thres}}{V_{17.4KeV}}\,\,(i.e.) \tag{3.5}\]

When the threshold measurement was finished the anode high voltage was returned to its original value.

## 4 Space-time relationship

The space-time relation was determined using the muon track information given by the CSCs. A sample \(y\)-\(t\) relation is given in figure 4. To determine the \(r\)-\(t\) relation, two passes were made on the data. In the first pass, the \(t\) values were averaged in bins of \(y\), then the average values were fit to a fifth order polynomial to give the \(r\)-\(t\) relation and to determine the \(y_{0}\) position of the wire. In the second pass, this polynomial was used to remove points greater than 10 \(\sigma\) from the fitted value. Again, the \(t\) values were averaged in bins of \(y\), where these average values were used to determine the space-time relationship. I should emphasize that the polynomial fit was only used for the 10 \(\sigma\) cut to take the average for the true space-time relation where these averages were used in the next section.

## 5 Resolution measurement

The resolution measurement was done by comparing the position of a track, \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\), in two adjacent tubes (#1 and #2). (We found \(y_{1}\) and \(y_{2}\) from \(t_{1}\) and \(t_{2}\) using the space-time relationship discussed in the previous section.) The difference between the two tubes, \(y_{1}-y_{2}\), will be called the residual. The RMS angle of the beam (in the \(y\)-\(z\) plane) was about 2 mrad. A track with an angle of 2 mrad would give a real position difference between adjacent tubes of 60 \(\mu\)m. To remove this contribution, each event was corrected for the angle of the track given by the CSCs. The residual is then put into bins, 1 mm wide, of distance from the wire. This distribution is then fit with a gaussian plus a constant. A sample plot is in figure 5. Figure 5 shows the residuals versus their

Figure 5: Sample fit to residuals for r\(=\) 3.5 to 4.5 mm\(y\) positions where it is easy to see the poor resolution near the wire (center of the figure) due to Landau fluctuations.

The fit on the residuals must now be converted into a resolution. Here we assume that the resolution of each tube is equal. The tube wire position is at the same \(y\) position for both tubes. This geometry makes the error contribution from each tube to be equal. Therefore, the error from the two tubes add in quadrature, which makes the conversion from the residual to the resolution simply a constant factor of \(\sqrt{2}\).

As a consistency check, tubes #3 and #6 were compared with the same method and gave similar results, though less consistent because of the large separation between the tubes.

Drift tube simulation

To optimize MDT performance and study the position resolution dependence on a variety of factors, we have developed an MDT simulation program that takes into account the following processes:

* Cluster production (Position_and_ size of primary ionization clusters along the particle track)
* Electron drift and diffusion
* Charge multiplication
* The prompt electron signal contribution
* Readout electronic shaping
* Electronic noise

The simulation starts by modeling the cluster position along the track according to a Poisson distribution. The particle energy loss in the gas was then simulated using a method that takes into account detector media atomic levels based on the photo-absorption cross section [2]. Based on this energy loss, the number of secondary electrons in a cluster was simulated according to a binomial distribution [3]. For each electron produced, a process of multiplication in a strong electric field near the anode was simulated according to a Polya distribution [4]. The fraction of the prompt electron signal to the total signal was calculated by taking into account the experimentally measured dependence of the gas gain on H.V. (See section 3.1) This fraction contains 1.8% of the total charge, but the electron signal contribution depends on the shaping time. For example, with a shaping time of 10 nsec, the contribution increases to 20% of the signal. The drift velocity and diffusion coefficients were calculated separately using the program MAGBDLTZ and then input into the simulation.

For this note, the input parameters for the simulation were as follows. The input impedence of the electronics was 60\(\Omega\). The equivalent noise charge was 4500 and 7500 electrons for the 7.5 and 35 nsec shaping times, respectively. The values used for the fraction of the total charge collected (equation 3.2) were 4% for 7.5 nsec and 11% for 35 nsec. The Monte Carlo results and comparison with the data are presented in the next section.

## 7 Results

Figures 7 and 8 show good agreement between simulation and data. Qualitatively, these figures show several good characteristics. The first thing to notice is that the resolution starts out very poor near the wire due to Landau fluctuations. Landau fluctuations quickly become less significant, but where Landau effects die out, the diffusion effects start to dominate. The diffusion contribution can be seen as the slow rise in resolution while moving away from the wire. Another feature is that the rise from diffusion is slower for longer shaping times because the diffusion fluctuations are "integrated" away. The figures also show that the resolution is slightly worse for longer shaping times which is due to the larger electronic noise contribution for longer shaping times. The difference between calculation and measurement for long drift lengths could possibly be caused by a difference in the calculated diffusion coefficients (using MAGBOLTZ) and the real diffusion coefficients for this gas. Despite this discrepancy, this agreement gives us confidence in our ability to understand and to predict the drift tube behavior.

Figure 8: Data and Monte Carlo for a gas gain of \(2*10^{4}\)

The data show for a fixed threshold, a faster shaping time gives better resolution. However, in the real experimental set-up containing a large number of readout channels, faster shaping times can lead to unwanted phenomenons such as channel to channel cross-talks, oscillations etc. It seems that the most realistic shaping time is between 10 and 20 nsec. In this case, some loss of resolution is compensated by operational stability of the readout electronics.
