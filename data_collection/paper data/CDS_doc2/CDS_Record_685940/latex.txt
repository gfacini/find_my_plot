## 1 Introduction

The ability to trigger on high transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) isolated electrons is of vital importance to the study of many physics processes at the LHC. Previous studies [1], [2], [3] have shown that a system using level 1 and 2 calorimeter triggers, combined with a level 2 tracking trigger can reduce the background rate from 'electron like' QCD jets below the level of real electrons. The necessary rejection from the inner detector (which mainly reduces the background from jets containing a substantial \(\pi^{0}\) component), can be achieved in the barrel using the silicon detectors (SCT), the transition radiation detectors (TRT), or for maximum robustness, a combination of both.

The current design of the ATLAS inner detector contains a transition from barrel geometry (silicon barrels and axial TRT straws) to endcap geometry (microstrip gas chamber (MSGC) disks and radial TRT straws) at around \(\left|\,\eta\,\right|\)=0.9-1.5 (see figure 1). The combination of silicon and MSGCs means that 4 precision space points (excluding the pixel detectors) are obtained for tracks with nearly all values of \(\eta\). However in the region 1.1 \(<\)\(\left|\,\eta\,\right|\)\(<\) 1.5, some of these are in silicon and some in MSGCs. Whilst this is fine for offline track reconstruction, things are clearly more complicated in the trigger system, where hits from different subdetectors with very different geometries must be combined to form track candidates.

This note investigates the problems of triggering in the transition region, using hits from silicon and MSGC detectors. A possible algorithm is described, and its performance evaluated in terms of electron efficiency and jet rejection. Occupancies and algorithms speeds are briefly discussed, however the detailed implementation questions of combining data from different subdetectors are not considered.

## 2 Track Triggering in the Transition Region

### Detector Layout and Simulation

The inner detector layout used was the DICE 'INNE' 3 layout--the baseline for the Technical Proposal, shown in figure 1[4]. The information from the silicon layers at \(r=\)30, 40, 50 and 60 cm was used, together with the first two MSGC planes at \(z=90.0\) and 97.2 cm. Only the \(\phi\) sides of the silicon layers were used, and the pitch was taken to be 112.5 \(\mu\) m, corresponding to the analogue/digital readout option. No charge division was simulated. The MSGCs extend from \(r=44\) to \(r=60\) cm, with a keystone geometry and a pitch of 178.6 \(\mu\) m at the inner radius. Each wheel consists of \(u\), \(v\) and \(\phi\) detectors, the stereo angle being \(\pm 1\) degree. The use of \(\phi\) detectors alone, and \(u\),\(v\) and \(\phi\) detectors together in the trigger was investigated.

All simulations were performed with DICE 2.03/20 and GEANT 3.21. To simulate high luminosity running, an average of 18 pileup events in the silicon and 36 in the MSGCs were superimposed. The pileup events were generated using GENCL [5] with \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. The silicon detectors were taken to be 98% efficient, whilst the MSGC digitisation was fully simulated in the DICE code, giving a single hit efficiency of \(\sim 95\%\). No additional noise hits were added.

The standard T2SI silicon trigger code in ATRECON was modified to work with the latest DICE 'SCT' detectors in the Technical Proposal layout rather than the 'SITV' detectors in the Panel layout. The trigger performance in the barrel is similar to that found in [3] for the Panel layout. The T2SI algorithm was also modified to use information from the MSGC detectors taken from the RoI building part of the MSGC track trigger (not yet released) [6]. This code simulates the MSGC front end in performing some online clustering of adjacent hits into MSGC clusters, thus reducing the effective occupancy.

### Trigger Algorithms

In the barrel region, the trigger works by performing combinatoric fitting in the \((\phi,r)\) plane, looking for tracks with hits in at least 3 out of 4 SCT layers [3]. In the forward

Figure 1: The technical proposal baseline layout of the ATLAS inner detectorregion, the 'natural' coordinates are \((\phi,z)\), so a smooth transition from one coordinate set to the other is not possible.

The approach used in this work treats the first two MSGC planes as 'virtual' extensions of the last two silicon layers (see figure 2). The SCT is divided into modules along \(z\), each with length 11.7 cm, the last module being number 7, with active area extending to \(z=81.4\) cm. Hits from MSGC plane 1 are placed in the module 8 position, both on SCT layer 4, for tracks around \(\eta\) [\(=1.3\), and on layer 3, for tracks around \(\eta=1.4\). Hits from MSGC plane 2 are placed on silicon layer 4 in the 9th SCT module.

For the \(\phi\) planes, the \(\phi\) coordinate is measured directly by the MSGC, but the radial position of the hit is undetermined. The radial position assumed in the algorithm does not have to be the same as that of hits from the corresponding SCT layer, and was adjusted to give the best resolution. The \(u\) and \(v\) planes do not measure \(\phi\), so here local space point reconstruction was attempted looking for all \(v\) hits that could go with a possible \(u\) hit. This then gave both the \(\phi\) and radial position of the hit.

Two algorithms were investigated--one using just the hits in the \(\phi\) MSGC planes (as in the barrel), and one also using the reconstructed space points from the \(u\) and \(v\) planes. This is not the optimal use of the MSGC information, since it treats \(\phi\) and \(u,v\) hits differently. An optimal algorithm would reconstruct space points taking each of the coordinate pairs \((\phi,u)\), \((\phi,v)\) and \((u,v)\) separately to give \((r,\phi)\) information. In this case, the local pattern recognition problems are more complex, especially as the \(\phi\) detectors are rotated in \(\phi\) with respect to the \(u\) and \(v\) detectors, and it is not clear that such complex processing could be performed in the trigger. This requires further study.

### Performance for single muons

The two algorithms were tested on samples of 1500 \(p_{T}=40\) GeV muons in the transition region. The \(1/p_{T}\) resolutions are shown in figure 3, for runs with and without pileup. The SCT+\(\phi\) and SCT+\(uv\phi\) algorithms both give resolutions of around 18% without pileup, which deteriorate to 21.5% and 19.8% with pileup. The corresponding resolution for the barrel SCT trigger is around 10% at 40 GeV. Significant tails at low \(1/p_{T\{trig\}}\) are also apparent with pileup, showing a number of tracks which have been mismeasured

Figure 2: Layout of silicon and MSGC detectors in the transition region. The ‘virtual’ positions of the MSGC detectors assumed in the trigger are shown by dotted lines

with high \(p_{T}\). This will contribute to the fake trigger rate in jet events.

Figure 4 shows the threshold curve for 1000 muons with \(p_{T}=\)10-100 GeV in the transition region, with the trigger threshold set at \(p_{T}=34\) GeV. The worse \(p_{T}\) resolution than in the barrel clearly affects the threshold width (see [3]), and there is a significant number of fake triggers at low muon \(p_{T}\).

Figure 4 also shows the trigger efficiency as a function of \(\eta\) in the transition region. There is a small dip in efficiency at \(\mid\eta\mid\approx 1.15\), this is caused by the gap in coverage between the end of SCT layer 4 at \(z=81.4\) cm and the first MSGC layer at \(z=90\) cm. Some more recent layout optimisations [8] have eliminated this problem, by reducing the radius of the outermost SCT layer and/or adding to the first forward wheel.

The trigger efficiency starts to drop off beyond \(\mid\eta\mid=\)1.4, so the electron efficiency and jet rejection calculations have been done between 1.1 \(<\mid\eta\mid<\) 1.4. Beyond \(\mid\eta\mid=\) 1.4, the track has more hits in the MSGCs, so an algorithm based on \(\phi z\) triggering and just

Figure 3: Trigger \(1/pt\) resolution for single 40 GeV \(p_{T}\) muons in transition region, without and with pileup

incorporating the innermost silicon layer may be more appropriate to cover this region. The target of all four precision hits in MSGCs is not attained until \(\mid\eta\mid\approx 1.6\)[9].

### Performance for electrons

The performance of the track trigger for single electrons was then investigated, using samples of 1000 \(e^{+}\) and \(e^{-}\) generated uniformly in \(p_{T}\) from 10-100 GeV over \(\mid\eta\mid<2.5\) and an additional sample of 500 \(e^{+}\) and \(e^{-}\) generated over 1.1 \(<\mid\eta\mid<1.5\). The \(p_{T}\) threshold curves, \(1/p_{T}\) resolution (integrated over 40-100 GeV) and efficiency versus \(\eta\) curves are shown in figure 5 for the SCT+\(\phi\) MSGC trigger, and in figure 6 for the SCT+\(uv\phi\) MSGC trigger.

It is clear that electron bremsstrahlung and pileup both adversely affect the trigger

resolution, and hence threshold sharpness and trigger efficiency. The SCT+\(\phi\) MSGC algorithm achieves an efficiency of \(83.7\pm 1.5\%\) for electrons with \(p_{T}>\)40 GeV, with a trigger threshold of 32 GeV. This drops to \(78.9\pm 1.6\%\) with pileup background. The SCT+\(uv\phi\) trigger does slightly better with efficiencies of \(84.7\pm 1.4\%\) and \(80.6\pm 1.6\%\) respectively. The corresponding figures for the barrel (\(\parallel\eta\parallel<1.1\)) using the same threshold, are \(95.4\pm 0.8\%\) without pileup and \(94.0\pm 0.9\%\) with pileup.

Both algorithms have a considerable rate of fake triggers well below \(p_{T}=40\) GeV, which will clearly affect the rate of fake track triggers in jet events. However, in previous studies [1], [3], it was found that the performance of the combined level 2 system (calorimeter + track trigger + \(\phi\) matching) was very robust to degradation of the track trigger. Whether this remains true in the transition region can only be determined by a study of jet rejection, described in the next section.

## 3 Global Electron Triggering

### Event generation

As in previous studies, a large sample of jet events was generated using PYTHIA [7], simulated through the detector and passed through the level 1 trigger, to give a reasonable sized sample of events to test the level 2 system. Two-jet events were produced with \(p_{T(hard)}>35\) GeV and \(\mid\eta\mid_{hard}<2.5\), passed through a particle level prefilter and then simulated with DICE, saving events that passed the level 1 calorimeter trigger. The generation procedure is described in more detail in [1]. A total of 61150 events were simulated at Oxford and RAL, to give 715 events passing the level 1 trigger, of which 422 contained a region of interest (RoI) in the barrel, and 121 in the transition

### Electron efficiency and jet rejection

The performance of the level 2 track trigger was studied in conjunction with the level 2 calorimeter trigger. The calorimeter algorithm used was as described in [3], except that in the transition region, the cuts were reoptimised, being \(E_{\mathit{c}ore}>40\) GeV, \(E_{\mathit{inner}}/E_{\mathit{c}ore}<0.25\) and \(E_{\mathit{outer}}/E_{\mathit{c}ore}<0.1\), for core, inner and outerisolation rings sizes of \(2\times 2\), \(4\times 4\) and \(6\times 6\) electromagnetic calorimeter cells respectively.

Four track triggers were tried in the transition region--the \(\phi\) MSGC and \(\mathit{uv}\phi\) MSGC algorithms, each with a tight \(p_{T}\) cut corresponding to that used in the barrel (32 GeV) and a looser \(p_{T}\) cut, adjusted to give \(\sim 80\%\) efficiency for the global level 2 electron trigger. The minimum \(p_{T}\), maximum fit RMS and maximum track-calorimeter \(\Delta\phi\) match for each trigger are listed in table 1.

The global triggering results are summarised in table 2, for the barrel track trigger and two transition region track triggers. The table shows the efficiencies for calorimeter and track triggers separately, as well as combined and with \(\Delta\phi\) track-calorimeter match, for the electron and jet samples without and with pileup.

The results for the barrel are compatible with those found in [3]. In the transition region, the calorimeter rejection is slightly worse. The track trigger electron efficiencies are worse than in the barrel, as would be expected, being around 87% with the loose \(p_{T}\) cut and 81% with the tight \(p_{T}\) cut, and decreasing slightly with pileup background. The global electron efficiency is between 75% and 80%.

The track trigger jet rejection is around a factor 1.5-2 worse than in the barrel in the absence of pileup, but the global jet efficiency is similar at 1.5%. Only 2 events pass in the transition region, and both of these contain a \(\pi^{+}\) with \(p_{T}>40\) GeV. However, when pileup (36 superimposed events in the MSGCs) is added, the fake track rate rises so much that over 50% of the events have a high \(p_{T}\) trigger. Some of these fake tracks are removed by the calorimeter matching cut, but the final jet trigger efficiency is still in excess of 5%, even for the tight \(p_{T}\) cuts.

Little difference is observed between the \(\phi\) only and \(\mathit{uv}\phi\) MSGC algorithms--the trigger rate appears to be dominated by fake tracks produced by the extra pileup hits, and these tracks cause correlated hits in both the \(\phi\) planes and nearby \(u\) and \(v\) planes. The trigger algorithm allows for one missing 'layer', and the whole \(\mathit{uv}\phi\) triplet of MSGC detectors constitutes one layer, so a track will be allowed even if it has no hit in any of the three detectors in one layer. However, requiring at least one of \(\mathit{uv}\) or \(\phi\) to give a point in the trigger fit on each MSGC layer does not reduce the fake rate, as most of the fake tracks have a missing silicon layer. Also, there are regions in the geometrical acceptance (e.g. \(\mid\eta\mid\approx 1.15\)) where there is no MSGC plane, so no possibility of demanding a 4 point track.

Clearly, the performance of the trigger in the transition region is much worse than

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Trigger & Minimum & Maximum & Maximum track-calo \\  & track \(p_{T}\) (GeV) & track RMS & match (\(\Delta\phi\)) \\ \hline Barrel & 32 & 2.0 & 0.02 \\ \(\phi\) tight \(p_{T}\) & 32 & 2.5 & 0.025 \\ \(\phi\) loose \(p_{T}\) & 26 & 2.5 & 0.025 \\ \(\mathit{uv}\phi\) tight \(p_{T}\) & 32 & 2.5 & 0.025 \\ \(\mathit{uv}\phi\) loose \(p_{T}\) & 25 & 2.5 & 0.025 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

trigger algorithm. The mean number of clusters in the RoI is around 60, compared to 32 in layer 1 and 23 in layer 4 of the SCT. Bearing in mind the two bunch crossings seen in the MSGC, this number is no larger than expected.

The main effect of the pileup background is to produce fake tracks, by random alignment with one layer of silicon. The very simple MSGC hit clustering algorithm may be having an adverse effect here--each track produces a series of closely spaced hits and these are combined into a cluster whose position is the unweighted centre of all the hits. Thus nearby hits can be combined, keeping the cluster occupancy down, but producing wide clusters with a low position resolution. The low spatial resolution of the MSGCs (179 \(\mu\)m at \(r=44\) cm rising to 243 \(\mu\)m at \(r=60\) cm) compared to the silicon (112.5 \(\mu\)m) may also be a contributing factor.

On the other hand, the cluster occupancy of the MSGCs is not much higher than in the silicon, so the data volume and algorithm execution time should not be much worse than in the barrel. Figure 7(b) shows the number of valid _uv_ combinations found per \(u\) cluster, this has an average of only 1.3 so the reconstruction of local space points in the trigger does not look too difficult. However, at least in this simple algorithm, the gain in performance by using the \(u\) and \(v\) plane information seems limited to a small increase

In the electron efficiency, so it may not justify the extra complexity of local space point reconstruction.

## 4 Conclusions

An algorithm has been developed for triggering which gives reasonable electron efficiency in the transition region. However, the rate of fake triggers is around 4 times that found in the barrel, which introduces a significant increase in the overall trigger rate. The standalone track trigger rate is also much higher in the transition region, so the system is much less 'robust' to electronic noise, alignment errors etc. than in the barrel.

More work is clearly needed, some of the more important areas are discussed briefly below:

**MSGC pileup occupancy**: The most important effect appears to be the fake track rate caused by occupancy from pileup. This has been simulated using 2 bunch crossings, but MSGC tagging algorithms may reduce this to 1.5 or even 1, but with some loss in hit efficiency [9]. The sensitivity to low \(p_{T}\) looping tracks may also be reduced. This will clearly affect the fake track rate and needs to be carefully studied.
**Optimisation of layout**: The efficiency vs. \(\eta\) plots (see figures 4, 5 and 6) show a drop in efficiency due to a gap in tracker coverage. This could be improved with an optimised tracker layout in the transition region.
**MSGC (forward) trigger algorithm**: It will be interesting to compare these results with those from a pure MSGC triggering the forward region, to see if the robust trigger performance in the barrel is regained beyond the end of the transition region. Studies of triggering using the MSGCs should also give information on the best way to reconstruct space points using the \(u\), \(v\) and \(\phi\) layers together, and whether space point reconstruction is feasible at the trigger level. The approach used could then be extended to the transition region.
**Implemntation questions**: It has been assumed that the architecture of the level 2 trigger system will allow the raw data from the SCT and MSGC to be used in the same feature extractor running the trigger algorithm. However, this has not yet been studied in detail. In the extreme forward region, the GaAs detectors may also have to be used, giving a similar problem.
