A measurement of the calorimeter response to isolated single hadrons is presented. Inclusive hadron response is measured and found to be in reasonable agreement with the detector simulation, once the neutral background has been removed. Displaced particle decays are used to identify several particle species and measure their responses separately. The previous analysis based on 2010 data and an older Geant4 version and hadronic physics description showed consistency in inclusive single-particle response and 20%-level discrepancies in the modeling of anti-proton response at low momenta. These updated studies suggest that anti-proton response at low momenta is now correctly modeled but indicate a new deficit of about 5% in the modeling of pion response in the central portion of the calorimeter.

Introduction

The measurement of single hadron response in the calorimeter provides an important validation of the modeling of hadronic showers and detector geometry. It is one of the only low-level measurements that can verify, component-by-component, the modeling of jet response. The single hadron response was measured in ATLAS using data in 2010 [1].

This note describes the updated measurement of inclusive single hadron response using data from 2012 and the most recent detector simulation. As in 2010, the decays of known particles are also used to identify the type of particle entering the calorimeter, in order to further validate the details of the hadronic physics models, as well as to understand the effects of clustering thresholds and shower width when particle showers overlap in the calorimeter. The latter provides an in situ test of clustering effects and hadronic shower width, although the two are difficult to disentangle.

The note is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data sample and event selection, as well as the reconstruction methodology. Section 3 then details the measurement of inclusive hadron response, including the subtraction of neutral background particles. The calorimeter response of single hadrons identified using displaced decays is described in Section 4. The same decays are used in Section 5 to test the response of close-by particles. Finally, Section 6 provides some conclusions of these studies.

## 2 Detector, Data and Selection

The ATLAS detector is a general purpose particle detector consisting of an inner tracking detector (ID), a calorimeter, and a muon spectrometer. The details of the detector are given in Ref. [2]. The ID consists of silicon pixel and strip (SCT) tracking detectors and a straw-tube tracker (TRT). The sampling calorimetry is hermetic out to \(|\eta|=4.9\) and is generally divided into barrel (\(|\eta|<1.4\)), endcap (\(1.4<|\eta|<3.2\)) and forward (\(3.2<|\eta|\)) regions. The electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry uses liquid argon with lead or copper absorber. The hadronic calorimetry uses scintillating tiles with steel absorber in the barrel and liquid argon with copper (tungsten) absorber in the endcap (forward) region.

A sample of 8 million data events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3.2 nb\({}^{-1}\) from a minimum bias run taken at the beginning of 2012 at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV are compared to 20 million simulated single-, double-, and non-diffractive proton-proton collision events, generated using Pythia8[3] using the A2 tune [4] and MSTW 2008 LO PDF set [5, 6]. The simulated events are passed through the ATLAS detector simulation [7] based on Geant4[8] 9.4. Two samples with two different collections of hadronic physics models are used: one, called QGSP_BERT (or simply QGSP), includes a quark-gluon string model at high energy and the Bertini intranuclear cascade at low energy; the other, called FTFP_BERT (or simply FTFP), includes the Fritijof model at high energy and the Bertini intranuclear cascade at low energy. The data were collected during a "low-\(\mu\)" run, in which a negligible fraction of events include more than one simultaneous proton-proton collision. The simulated detector conditions match those of the run, and the simulated events and data are passed through the same minimum bias trigger and reconstruction software.

Each event is required to have a well reconstructed vertex with at least four associated tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>400\) MeV. The tracks selected for the measurement are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>500\) MeV and to have at least one hit in the pixel detector and six hits in the SCT, as well as small longitudinal and transverse parameters \(|z_{0}|\mathrm{sin}\theta<1.5\) mm and \(|d_{0}|<1.5\) mm [1]. This ensures that the track comes from the primary vertex and reduces the contribution from fake tracks to a negligible level. In order to ensure that the tracks are isolated, no other track extrapolated to the second longitudinal layer of the EM calorimeter is allowed in a cone of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}<0.4\) around the track of the single charged hadron. This criterion was shown previously to exclude any effect from other nearby charged particles on the measurement [1].

In each event, the calorimeter cells' energy is clustered using a 4-2-0 algorithm [9]. This algorithm suppresses noise by forming energy clusters around "seeds" with at least four times more signal than the typical noise. All neighboring cells with at least two times more signal than the typical noise are added to the clusters, and a final layer of cells at the boundary of the cluster is added. This final layer improved the resolution in single-particle studies with the ATLAS calorimeter testbeam. The clusters are not calibrated beyond a correction for the sampling fraction of the calorimeter; no correction is applied for non-compensation or energy loss outside of the sampling portion of the calorimeter. This clustering suppresses the contribution of noise in the calorimeter.

## 3 Inclusive Hadron Response

The average ratio of the energy deposited by an isolated charged particle in the calorimeter, \(E\), to the momentum of the track \(p\) as measured by the inner tracking detector is used to study the calorimeter response to single charged hadrons. As the track momentum measurement has a small uncertainty, which is negligible below 5 GeV and is taken as a conservative 1% above this value [1], it is an excellent reference for the energy measurement of the isolated charged hadron.

The energy of a cluster in a certain layer of the calorimeter is associated to the track if the energy weighted position of the cells associated to the cluster in that layer is situated within \(\Delta R<0.2\) of the extrapolated position of the track in that particular layer. The cone \(\Delta R<0.2\) around the track was optimized such that about 90% of the energy of the charged hadron is included in it, while the contribution from the neutral particle background is kept to a minimum [1].

### \(E/p\) Distributions

Figure 1 shows two examples of the \(E/p\) distributions in data and both Monte Carlo simulations. The large fraction of tracks with \(E/p=0\) corresponds to tracks without an associated cluster in the calorimeter. This can be caused when a particle interacts hadronically before reaching the calorimeter or when no single energy deposit is large enough to seed a cluster [1]. The small negative tail of these distributions is caused by noise in the calorimeter, while the long positive tail is caused by the background of neutral particles. At high momenta reasonable agreement is visible over the entire distribution, while at low momenta the MC underestimates the negative tail from noise; this tail is only a very small fraction of the distribution.

### Neutral background subtraction

Energy deposits from close-by particles could bias the calorimeter measurement of \(E\). While the isolation requirement on the single hadron track is efficient at reducing the effect of other charged particles to negligible levels, there is no equivalent method for eliminating the contribution from neutral particles, such as neutral hadrons or photons from \(\pi^{0}\to\gamma\gamma\) decays.

Since the deposits of energy from neutral particles are mostly in the EM calorimeter, it is possible to measure the background in situ by considering late showering charged hadrons, which behave like minimum ionizing particles (MIP) in the EM region of the calorimeter. Such late showering hadrons are selected by requiring that they leave less than 1.1 GeV in the EM calorimeter inside a cone of \(\Delta R<0.1\) around their track. They are further required to have an energy deposited in the same cone in the hadronic calorimeter that is at least 40% of the track momentum. The energy deposited by close-by neutral particles is then measured in the EM calorimeter in the region \(0.1<\Delta R<0.2\) around the MIP-like particle's track. A geometric factor of \(\frac{4}{3}\) is applied to estimate the energy deposits from the neutral background in the whole \(\Delta R<0.2\) cone. The mean of this background distribution over many eventsin a given momentum and pseudo-rapidity bin, \(<E/p>_{\rm BG}\), estimates the energy deposited by photons and neutral hadrons in the EM calorimeter. Using a similar method, the energy deposited by the neutral particles in the hadronic calorimeter was found to be negligible. This strategy is described in more detail in Ref. [1].

Figure 2 and Figure 3 show the measured \(<E/p>_{\rm BG}\) in data and both Monte Carlo simulations as a function of momentum and pseudorapidty, respectively. The general trend is confirmed by the simulations, but important discrepancies exist between the two, such as the simulation's overestimation of the background at intermediate (\(2<p/\mbox{\rm GeV}<8\)) momentum. These are attributed to the imperfect modelling of non-perturbative QCD processes in Pythia8, as well as the difficulty of correctly modeling the calorimeter response to low momentum neutral particles.

### Background-corrected single hadron response

The corrected \(E/p\) observable, in which the average neutral background is subtracted, is shown in Figure 4 with statistical uncertainties, for several bins of pseudorapidity. Here, the background estimated in data is subtracted from the raw data \(E/p\), and the background estimated in MC is subtracted from the raw MC \(E/p\). The maximum momentum that can be effectively probed with the available data is about 30 GeV, and the measurement has large statistical uncertainties above 20 GeV, limiting the comparison. Both samples of Monte Carlo overestimate \(\langle E/p\rangle\) at low momentum, by approximately 5% in the most central \(|\eta|\) region. In more forward regions (e.g. \(0.6<|\eta|<1.1\)), where the background is comparable for the same momenta but the material in front of the calorimeter is substantially larger, the agreement is good.

## 4 Identified Particle Response

In addition to the inclusive isolated tracks, jet reconstruction requires an understanding of specific particle species. A jet includes a variety of hadrons which need to be modelled individually. A measurement of the response of individual hadron types can be used to validate that the Monte Carlo correctly models the entirety of the jet shower. This study uses decays of identified, short-lived particles to extract a sample of individual particle species to provide separate measurements of their responses. The results are presented

Figure 1: (a) The \(E/p\) distribution for isolated tracks with \(|\eta|<0.6\) and \(1.2<p/\mbox{\rm GeV}<1.8\). (b) The \(E/p\) distribution for isolated tracks with with \(1.9<|\eta|<2.3\) and \(2.8<p/\mbox{\rm GeV}<3.6\).

as a difference in the ratio \(E/p\) between different particle species to minimize the effect of background.

Decays of \(\Lambda\), \(\bar{\Lambda}\), and \(K_{s}\) hadrons are used to identify individual protons, anti-protons, and pions respectively. These hadrons are required to be isolated from all other tracks in the event. The responses of these particles are expected to differ, particularly for the anti-proton because of its eventual annihilation. These differences can be extracted at low energy, where they have a significant effect, by measuring the response for isolated single protons, pions, and anti-protons.

### Event Selection

In addition to the event selection required for the inclusive tracks listed in Section 2, events are required to have a secondary vertex. The data and Monte Carlo samples are described in Section 2. The same selection used for inclusive tracks is applied to the identified hadrons, except for the impact parameter requirement. In addition, tracks are required to have a pseudorapidity dependent number of hits in the TRT. This requirement suppresses the contribution of nuclear interactions in the inner detector. The definition of the \(E/p\) observable and the isolation requirements are presented in Section 2.

To match the energy available to deposit in the calorimeter, the ratio \(E/p\) is measured as a function of the available energy, \(E_{a}\), calculated using information in the tracker. For pions, the available energy is just the total energy: \(E_{a}=\sqrt{p^{2}+m^{2}}\). For protons, the available energy is just the kinetic energy: \(E_{a}=\sqrt{p^{2}+m^{2}}-m\). For anti-protons, the available energy is the sum of the total energy and the rest mass, to account for annihilation: \(E_{a}=\sqrt{p^{2}+m^{2}}+m\).

### Reconstruction of Particle Candidates

The selection of short-lived particle decays is based on previous ATLAS results [10]. The decay \(K_{s}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), the dominant \(K_{s}\) decay to charged particles by several orders of magnitude, is used to select pions. Similarly, the decays \(\Lambda\to\pi^{-}p\) and \(\bar{\Lambda}\to\pi^{+}\bar{p}\), also the dominant \(\Lambda\) and \(\bar{\Lambda}\) decays to charged particles by several orders of magnitude, are used to identify protons and anti-protons respectively. In \(\Lambda\) and \(\bar{\Lambda}\) decays, it is kinematically favored for the proton or anti-proton to have greater momentum than the pion. So, a positively-charged, higher momentum track indicates that the candidate is a \(\Lambda\) while a negatively-charged higher momentum track indicates that the candidate is a \(\bar{\Lambda}\). The decay product tracks are both required to have \(p_{T}>500\) MeV. The tracks used to measure the \(E/p\) distributions are divided into two bins of pseudorapidity, \(|\eta|<0.6\) and \(0.6<|\eta|<1.1\). Tracks with larger pseudorapidity are consistent with these, but have significantly lower statistics.

Example mass distributions for reconstructed \(K_{s}\), \(\Lambda\), and \(\bar{\Lambda}\) candidates with at least one central track (\(|\eta|<0.6\)) are shown in Figure 5. These mass distributions are fitted to a modified Gaussian signal function and a polynomial background in bins of pseudorapidity as described in Ref. [1]. For each candidate type and each bin of pseudorapidity, the fits are used to construct an acceptance window to minimize background while retaining the majority of candidates. The windows are centered on the fitted mean with a width three times the width of the fitted signal function. The number candidates found in data and each Monte Carlo sample after passing the pseudorapidity dependent mass cuts and the remaining selection are shown in Table 1. These raw counts show clearly that roughly twice as many events were generated with FTFP_BERT as with QGSP_BERT. A similar difference in the relative yields between \(\Lambda\) and \(K_{s}\) was observed in 2010 [1].

### Charged Background

There are three primary sources of charged backgrounds in the identified particle \(E/p\) distributions. First, nuclear interactions in the inner detector can fake short-lived particles. The narrow mass window for decay candidates suppresses this background significantly. The tracks can also undergo nuclear 

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c} \hline Candidate & Data & QGSP & FTFP \\ \hline \(K_{s}\) & \(2.3\times 10^{5}\) & \(2.2\times 10^{5}\) & \(4.4\times 10^{5}\) \\ \(\Lambda\) & \(1.1\times 10^{4}\) & \(7.9\times 10^{3}\) & \(1.6\times 10^{4}\) \\ \(\tilde{\Lambda}\) & \(1.0\times 10^{4}\) & \(7.1\times 10^{3}\) & \(1.5\times 10^{4}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

interactions before entering the calorimeter. These types of interactions are suppressed by requiring that the daughter tracks have hits in the TRT.

Another charged background for identified candidates comes from combinatorics. The purity of \(K_{s}\) candidates is found to be high (\(>99\%\)), and the majority of inclusive tracks are pions, so no correction is applied to the pion \(E/p\) distributions [1]. The \(\Lambda\) and \(\bar{\Lambda}\) candidates can be faked in assigning the proton mass to pions from \(K_{s}\) decays. To remove this background, we veto \(\Lambda\) and \(\bar{\Lambda}\) candidates which fall within the \(K_{s}\) mass window when the invariant mass is calculated using the pion hypothesis. After applying this veto and the remaining selection, the combinatoric background for \(\Lambda\) and \(\bar{\Lambda}\) is found to be small (\(<1\%\)), as seen in Figure 5.

The final charged background for the proton (anti-proton) \(E/p\) distributions occurs when a \(\Lambda\) (\(\bar{\Lambda}\)) decay fakes a \(\bar{\Lambda}\) (\(\Lambda\)) decay because the pion is actually the higher momentum track. This is most common for low energy \(\Lambda\) or \(\bar{\Lambda}\), and is governed by well understood two body decay kinematics. These fakes are suppressed by the kinematic requirements on the candidates, but are still present. However, since the mechanism is well understood, it should be accurately described in the Monte Carlo and is taken into account through Monte Carlo predictions.

There is also a contribution to the \(E/p\) distributions from the neutral background, as discussed in Section 3, as isolation is defined relative to charged particles. The distributions are presented as differences between particle species, and the neutral background should cancel in the difference. The isolation with charged particles ensures that this background is not correlated with jet-like activity. This cancellation was tested using a simulation of single particles and was found to be valid to within statistical uncertainties [1]. No additional correction or uncertainty is added for the neutral background. Thus, all of the systematic uncertainties arising from backgrounds are found to be negligible compared to the statistical errors of the available data sample.

### Identified Particle Response

Examples of the uncorrected distributions of \(E/p\) for \(\pi^{+}\), \(\pi^{-}\), \(p\), and \(\bar{p}\) are shown in Figure 6, for a single bin of momentum and pseudorapidity: \(2.2<E_{a}/\mathrm{GeV}<2.8\) and \(|\eta|<0.6\). As in the inclusive tracks, a small fraction of the identified tracks have negative values of \(E/p\). They are not corrected for the neutral background, and thus have a long positive tail. The positive tail for the anti-proton response is much more prominent because of the annihilation of the anti-proton, which leads to a significantly greater response to anti-protons than to pions or protons. The response is well-modelled by the Monte Carlo to within the available statistics.

A significant feature of the \(E/p\) distributions is the fraction of tracks with \(E=0\), as seen in Figure 1. The fraction is large at low available energy, and the agreement between data and Monte Carlo simulation reflects the modelling of the material in front of the calorimeter. The zero fraction compared between particle species is shown in Figure 7, in data and simulation with FTFP_BERT physics list. The results with QGSP_BERT are very similar. The Monte Carlo simulation underestimates the zero fraction by approximately 10% at low \(E_{a}\), although the available statistics in data and Monte Carlo are very limited.

In order to reduce the effect of the neutral background, the average responses, \(\langle E/p\rangle\), are measured as differences between pairs of particle species. The averages are just the arithmetic means of the \(E/p\) distributions. The difference between \(\pi^{+}\) and \(\pi^{-}\) is shown in Figure 8, for both bins of pseudorapidity (\(|\eta|<0.6\) and \(0.6<|\eta|<1.1\)). The \(\pi^{+}\) response is greater on average than the response of \(\pi^{-}\) at low energy, which agrees with Ref. [11], where the difference is attributed to a charge-exchange effect. The simulation models the data fairly well, with some trend to underestimate the difference, although there are large statistical uncertainties at higher available energy.

Figure 9 shows the difference between proton and \(\pi^{+}\) response for both pseudorapidity bins. The proton response is smaller than the pion response on average because a larger fraction of the initial energy is converted into an electromagnetic shower for pions [12]. This is clear in the \(E/p\) difference,

Figure 7: The zero fraction for identified \(\pi^{+}\), \(\pi^{-}\), \(p\), and \(\bar{p}\) tracks with (a) \(|\eta|<0.6\) and (b) \(2.2<E_{a}/\text{GeV}<2.8\). The panel at the bottom of each figure shows the ratio of data to MC for pions. The proton and anti-proton results have large statistical uncertainties, and the data and MC are consistent.

where the pion response is about 10% greater on average. The data and Monte Carlo simulation are fairly consistent, though there are large statistical uncertainties because of the low number of identified protons.

Figure 10 shows the difference between anti-proton and \(\pi^{-}\) response for both pseudorapidity bins. The anti-proton response is expected to be significantly larger than the pion response at low available energy, because of the annihilation of the anti-proton in the calorimeter. This is clear in both the data and the FTFP_BERT simulation, where the anti-proton response is about 20% greater at low \(E_{a}\). Here, there is a slight preference for the FTFP_BERT model. The disagreement with QGSP_BERT was also seen in Ref. [1].

Insofar as the neutral background is independent of the species of the particle of interest, the neutral background estimate described in Section 3 should be equally applicable to identified particles from displaced decays. Figure 11 shows the \(\langle E/p\rangle\) distributions for \(\pi^{+}\) and \(\pi^{-}\)in both bins of pseudorapidity. The mean values of the \(E/p\) distributions for identified \(\pi^{+}\) and \(\pi^{-}\) tracks are similar to the distributions for inclusive tracks as expected. The difference between \(\pi^{+}\) and \(\pi^{-}\) response is also clear here, as the \(\pi^{+}\) response is greater than the \(\pi^{-}\) response for the same range of \(|\eta|\) and \(E_{a}\). Although the available momenta of identified tracks is limited, these distributions suggest that the data and MC simulation differ in the \(\pi^{-}\) distributions, where the difference is consistently greater than 10% for available energy below 2 GeV, and are more consistent in the \(\pi^{+}\) distributions. This difference may explain the approximately 5% discrepancy at low momentum in the inclusive \(\langle E/p\rangle\) distributions, shown in Figure 4.

## 5 Close-by Particle Response

The identified decay candidates can also be used to measure the calorimeter response for particles with hadronic showers that overlap in the calorimeter. When the mother particle is significantly boosted, the decay products become collimated. For pion tracks above about 2 GeV from \(K_{s}\) decays, the range of opening angles between the two pions is large enough to measure the calorimeter response for overlapping and isolated tracks. This measurement probes the dependence of the response on calorimeter thresholds and splitting factors, as the additional energy of the nearby track can cause energy deposits that would otherwise be neglected to produce a signal. The increase in signal is related to both the threshold values and the width of the hadronic shower.

### Response to Nearby Particles

To measure the \(E/p\) response as a function of the opening angle between decay products, the \(\pi^{+}\) and \(\pi^{-}\) tracks are required to be isolated from all other tracks in the event but not from each other. The response of the \(\pi^{+}\) track is measured as a function of the distance in \(\eta-\phi\) space from the track of the \(\pi^{-}\). This is repeated for \(\pi^{-}\) tracks.

The \(E/p\) ratio should increase for the \(\pi^{+}\) as the separation decreases and more of the energy of the \(\pi^{-}\) is included in the calorimeter energy. In Figure 12, the response as a function of separation is shown as a a ratio to the response of isolated pions. When the separation is large (\(\Delta R>0.4\)), this ratio is constant and equal to unity to within statistical uncertainties. As the separation decreases below \(\Delta R<0.3\), the response is expected to increase and the cones around the pions begin to overlap. The evidence for this growth is statistically marginal but was more clear in previous studies with more luminosity [1].

The height of the response at small opening angles is related to threshold effects, as it measures the out-of-cluster energy [1]. The slope of the curve is related to the hadronic shower width. However, the number of identified tracks with very low separation is small, so the statistical uncertainties are too large to distinguish differences between the data and Monte Carlo simulation in the region of interest.

Figure 8: The difference in \(\langle E/p\rangle\) between \(\pi^{+}\) and \(\pi^{-}\) with (a) \(|\eta|<0.6\) and (b) \(0.6<|\eta|<1.1\).

Figure 11: \(\langle E/p\rangle\) as a function of available energy, corrected for the neutral background, for \(\pi^{+}\) tracks with (a) \(|\eta|<0.6\) and (b) \(0.6<|\eta|<1.1\) and for \(\pi^{-}\) tracks with (c) \(|\eta|<0.6\) and (d) \(0.6<|\eta|<1.1\).

Conclusion

A measurement of isolated single hadron response in the ATLAS detector with data at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV has been presented. This measurement uses the latest detector simulation. After background subtraction, some discrepancy is observed in the inclusive hadron response in the central calorimeter at the level of 5%. In more forward regions the MC simulation is consistent with the data.

Displaced decays are used to construct samples of identified particle species. These samples suggest that the description of anti-proton response from the hadronic physics models in the FTFP_BERT physics list are consistent with the data below 5 GeV, while those in QGSP_BERT differ by 10-20% with the data at low momenta. Both lists show discrepancies with the data in low-energy pion response, with the response of negatively charged pions in particular over-estimated by 10-20% below 2 GeV.
