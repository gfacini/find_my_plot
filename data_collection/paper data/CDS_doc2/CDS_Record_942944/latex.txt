**Abstract**

Precise measurements of the top quark and \(W\) boson polarizations in \(t\bar{t}\) events has been shown possible at a few percent level with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data and a fast detector simulation. These results are reevaluated in this note with a full detector simulation and a next-to-leading order generator for the semileptonic channel (\(t\bar{t}\to WWb\bar{b}\to l\nu jj_{1}j_{2}b\bar{b}\)). A particular emphasis is given to reconstruction and selection efficiencies of electrons, muons, jets and missing transverse momentum, where the main differences with fast simulation are expected. A good agreement is found for selection efficiencies, background rejection and systematic uncertainties coming from the \(b\)-jet energy scale. This assess the robustness of the analysis and confirms the results published previously.

Introduction

The measurements of \(W\) boson and top quark polarization in \(t\bar{t}\) events provide powerful tests of top production and decay mechanisms and are sensitive probes to new physics. \(W\) (top) spin information can be inferred from angular distributions of the daughter particles in the \(W\) (top) rest frame:

* The three \(W\) helicity state probabilities, \(F_{0}\) (longitudinal), \(F_{L}\) (left-handed) and \(F_{R}\) (right-handed), can be extracted from the \(\Psi\) angular distribution [1] : \[\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{d\cos\Psi}=\frac{3}{2}\left[F_{0}\left(\frac{\sin\Psi}{ \sqrt{2}}\right)^{2}+F_{L}\left(\frac{1-\cos\Psi}{2}\right)^{2}+F_{R}\left( \frac{1+\cos\Psi}{2}\right)^{2}\right]\] (1) where \(\Psi\) is the angle between the charged lepton direction in the \(W\) rest frame and the \(W\) direction in the top quark rest frame.
* The production asymmetry in \(t\bar{t}\) event is : \[A=\frac{\sigma(t_{\uparrow}\bar{t}_{\uparrow})+\sigma(t_{\downarrow}\bar{t}_{ \downarrow})-\sigma(t_{\uparrow}\bar{t}_{\downarrow})-\sigma(t_{\downarrow} \bar{t}_{\uparrow})}{\sigma(t_{\uparrow}\bar{t}_{\uparrow})+\sigma(t_{ \downarrow}\bar{t}_{\downarrow})+\sigma(t_{\uparrow}\bar{t}_{\downarrow})+ \sigma(t_{\downarrow}\bar{t}_{\uparrow})},\] (2) where \(\sigma(t_{\uparrow/\downarrow}\bar{t}_{\uparrow/\downarrow})\) denotes the production cross section of a top quark pair with spins up or down with respect to a quantization axis. It can be extracted from the \(\theta_{1}\) and \(\theta_{2}\) angular distribution [2] : \[\frac{1}{N}\frac{d^{2}N}{d\cos\theta_{1}d\cos\theta_{2}}=\frac{1}{4}(1-A|\alpha _{1}\alpha_{2}|\cos\theta_{1}\cos\theta_{2})\] (3) where \(\theta_{1}\) (\(\theta_{2}\)) is the angle between the direction of the \(t\) (\(\bar{t}\)) daughter in the \(t\) (\(\bar{t}\)) rest frame and the \(t\) (\(\bar{t}\)) direction in the \(t\bar{t}\) center of mass system. \(\alpha_{i}\) is the spin analyzing power of particle \(i\), i.e. the degree to which its direction is correlated to the spin of the parent top quark, ranging between -1 and 1.
* The production asymmetry \(A_{D}\), which can also be cast into the form shown in Equation (2), is extracted from the \(\Phi\) angular distribution [2] : \[\frac{1}{N}\frac{dN}{d\cos\Phi}=\frac{1}{2}(1-A_{D}|\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}|\cos\Phi)\] (4) where \(\Phi\) is the angle between the direction of flight of the two spin analyzers, defined in the \(t\) and \(\bar{t}\) rest frames respectively.

The Standard Model (SM) predictions at leading order for \(W\) boson polarization (\(F_{0}\), \(F_{L}\), \(F_{R}\)) and \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation (\(A\), \(A_{D}\)) observables are given in Table 1. The ATLAS sensitivity to these observables has been evaluated with a fast simulation of the detector [3]. A precision of 1 to 5% should be achievable with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, dominated by systematic uncertainties especially coming from the \(b\)-jet energy scale. These measurements require a complete reconstruction of the \(t\bar{t}\) system and a reliable Monte-Carlo description to correct for the biases induced by reconstruction and cuts. The purpose of this note is to assess the robustness of the fast simulation results using fully simulated events, and more particularly test the measurement method and reevaluate the systematics. Only the semileptonic channel (\(t\overline{t}\to WWb\overline{b}\to l\nu j_{1}j_{2}b\overline{b}\)) will be discussed. In this case the most powerful spin analyzers of the top are the charged lepton (\(\alpha_{l}=1\)) and the least energetic non-\(b\) jet in the top rest frame (\(\alpha_{lej}=0.51\)) [4].

This note is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the event generation and detector simulation. In section 3, emphasis is put on the reconstruction and selection of objects needed to reconstruct the \(W\)s and the tops, i.e. leptons, jets and missing transverse momentum. Section 4 explains the reconstruction of the whole event topology, and estimate the background (combinatorial and physics). Polarization results with detector systematic uncertainties are then presented. Section 5 is dedicated to conclusions.

## 2 Event simulation

With a next-to-leading order (NLO) cross-section around 850 pb [5], 3.8 millions of \(t\overline{t}\) semileptonic events will be produced for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), corresponding to one LHC year at low luminosity (\(10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)). Among those, 2.5 millions are signal events (\(t\overline{t}\to WW\bar{b}\to l\nu bq_{1}q_{2}\bar{b}\) with \(l=e,\mu\)) while 1.3 million events with \(l=\tau\) are considered as background. Non-\(t\overline{t}\) background is dominated by \(W\)+4jets and single top productions [3].

### Event generation

The samples used in this study are part of the "Rome" ATLAS Data Challenge [6] whose most important features are recalled here. Generation of \(t\overline{t}\) events is done using Monte Carlo leading-order (LO) generator TopReX 4.09 [7] and next-to-leading-order (NLO) generator MCatNLO 2.31 [8] with version 9.0.4 of ATLAS software [9]. Only the first one includes the Standard Model \(t\overline{t}\) spin correlation. A top mass of 175 GeV is assumed; it is smeared according to a Breit-Wigner distribution in TopReX, while it is kept fixed in MCatNLO. Partons are fragmented and hadronized using PYTHIA 6.2 [10] for TopReX and HERWIG 6.5 [11] for MCatNLO. Background events coming from \(W+4\) jets are treated with AlpGen [12] while the single tops are generated with TopReX. They all contain one \(W\) decaying leptonically (\(W\to l\nu\)). All TopReX samples are simulated without \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\) decays. TAUOLA and PHOTOS [13] are used to process the \(\tau\)-decay and radiative corrections. Initial, final state radiations and multiple interactions are simulated in agreement with CDF data extrapolated to LHC [14]. No pile-up events are added. The complete list of data samples used throughout this note is given in Table 2.

### Detector modeling

Once those events are produced, they are passed through a complete GEANT 4 [15] detector simulation corresponding to the "Rome" ATLAS layout: 2 pixel layers in the barrel, no TRT wheels for \(|\eta|>2.1\), absence of the EE muon chambers in the barrel-endcap transition region (1.0\(<|\eta|<\)1.4). A perfect detector is assumed, i.e. no dead channels or detector misalignments are introduced. The signals of each sub-detector are digitized2 and the whole event is reconstructed with software version 10.0.1 [9]. No trigger simulation is included.

Footnote 2: TRT threshold hits are not available, which mainly affects electron/pion separation.

Object style reconstructed outputs (AOD) are used in the following and all results are given for the MCatNLO sample, unless stated otherwise. An extensive comparison with fast simulation results is proposed throughout the note. They have been produced with TopReX 4.05 and MCatNLO 2.31 coupled to ATLFAST 2.6.0 [16].

## 3 Event selection

Semileptonic signal events are characterized by one (and only one) isolated lepton used for the trigger, at least 4 jets, of which at least 2 are \(b\)-jets, and missing transverse energy. The reconstruction and selection of each of these objects with the full ATLAS simulation are explained in this section. The reconstruction of \(W\)s and tops is reported in Section 4. Details on the \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\), \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) resolutions of each selected object are given in another note [17].

### Leptons

This section presents the lepton reconstruction and selection efficiencies applying calibration procedures tuned on "Rome" single lepton samples provided by \(\mathrm{e}\)/\(\gamma\) and \(\mu\) combined performance groups.

#### 3.1.1 Electrons

Electrons are identified and reconstructed with the egamma high p\({}_{T}\) algorithm (IsEM flag) by combining information from the electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter and the tracker (with no cut on the TRT threshold hits). The reconstruction efficiency averaged over the electron spectrum in \(t\bar{t}\) events is 83.3% for MCatNLO and TopReX. The upper part of Figure 1 shows its evolution as a function of \(\eta\) (left) and p\({}_{T}\) (right). The cracks, at \(\eta=0\) and in the barrel-endcap transition region (\(\eta\sim 1.4\)), are clearly visible, and a slow rising up to p\({}_{T}\sim\)100 GeV is observed. An isolation cut is applied on the EM + Hadronic (HAD) calorimeter activity around the electron cluster: E\({}_{T}\) (EM+HAD in \(\Delta\)R=0.3) \(<\) 10 GeV, isolation in a cone \(\Delta\)R=0.2 is not available in Rome samples.

As the electron momentum is measured in the EM calorimeter and in the tracker, it can benefit from both by mixing the information, see Appendix 1. Selecting events containing only one isolated electron with p\({}_{T}>\)20 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) yields an efficiency of 63% for a very high purity (\(>\) 99%). Injecting a 83.3% electron reconstruction efficiency in ATLFAST (where no inefficiency is assumed) gives 61.5% in fair agreement with the full simulation result. It should be noticed that the efficiency is slightly lower for TopReX (60%) because of a softer p\({}_{T}\) spectrum.

Figure 1: _Reconstruction efficiencies of selected electrons (up) and muons (down) as a function of \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\). No TRT cut on High Threshold hits is included. The lepton selection is p\({}_{T}>\)20 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\)._

#### 3.1.2 Muons

Muons are identified and reconstructed in the muon spectrometer with the Moore high p\({}_{T}\) algorithm. Extrapolated track parameters are then combined to the inner detector ones including information from the calorimeters (MuID algorithm). Only well matched tracks (\(\chi^{2}\)/NDF \(<\)20) are kept, which rejects muons from pion and kaon decays. The reconstruction efficiency averaged over the muon spectrum in \(t\bar{t}\) events is 85.6% for MCatNLO and TopReX. It is illustrated in the lower part of Figure 1 as a function of \(\eta\) (left) and p\({}_{T}\) (right). The crack at \(\eta\)=0 and the absence of the EE muon chambers (\(1.0<|\eta|<1.4\)) are clearly visible. The small drop of efficiency in the endcap region \(|\eta|>2.0\) is due to problems with pattern recognition. It is recovered in later software versions, and has negligible impact on this analysis. On the contrary to electrons, no dependence with p\({}_{T}\) is observed. The muon is required to be isolated, i.e no EM calorimeter activity around its track : E\({}_{T}\) (EM in \(\Delta\)R=0.2) \(<\) 10 GeV. This allows to reject muons from \(b\) and \(c\) jets.

Selecting events with only one isolated muon with p\({}_{T}>\)20 GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) yields an efficiency of 61% with a very high purity (\(>\) 99.5%). Injecting a 85.6% muon reconstruction efficiency in ATLFAST (where no inefficiency is assumed) gives 59% in fair agreement with the full simulation result. It should be noticed that the efficiency is slightly lower for TopReX (58%) because of a softer p\({}_{T}\) spectrum.

### Jets

Jets are reconstructed in the calorimeters with a cone algorithm of size \(\Delta R=0.4\), shown to be best suited for top studies [18]. Electrons and muons may be part of a jet. Corrections must therefore be performed, according to the distance between the jets and the leptons (Figure 2):

* jet)\(<\)0.1, the jet actually corresponds to the electron cluster. This explains the peak at 0 observed on Figure 2 left. This "jet" is therefore removed from the jet list.
* jet)\(<\)0.4, the electron, which is locally isolated, is inside the cone of a jet. In those events the electron 4-momentum is subtracted from the jet one.
* if \(\Delta R\)(muon-jet)\(<\)0.2, for a muon (different from the triggered one) with p\({}_{T}>\) 3 GeV, the muon is assumed to come from the jet. Its 4-momentum is therefore added to the jet one.

In order to compare with fast simulation results, a calibration is performed using the true quark energy from the TopReX sample (the hard process before any radiation has no meaning at next-to-leading order). The energy difference (\(\Delta E\)) between jets and true quarks matched in space (\(\Delta R<\)0.1) is computed in five \(\eta\) slices as a function of the reconstructed energy. Light jets and \(b\)-jets are treated separately. The third-order polynomial fits to those \(\Delta E\) distributions are applied on each jet in all samples (TopReX, MCatNLO, background). Ultimately, calibration functions from \(W\to jj\) in top decays and \(Z+\)jets samples will be used to determine the absolute jet energy scale [19].

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

### \(b\)-tagging

Among the selected jets, at least two are required to be \(b\)-tagged. The tagging algorithm combines the search for secondary vertexes (SV1) and computation of transverse and longitudinal impact parameters (IP3D) [20]. The rejection of the other jets depends on the chosen \(b\)-tagging efficiency (\(\epsilon_{b}\)), as shown in Figure 4. These results are obtained using Monte Carlo labeling, without applying any jet purification (no \(\Delta\)R cut between the jet and the closest b/c quark) or isolation (no \(\Delta\)R cut between jets).

The \(b\)-tagging is one of the main tool to reduce the non-\(t\bar{t}\) background (\(W\)+4jets, single top) to a negligible level. Figure 5 left shows the signal over non-\(t\bar{t}\) background (S/B) when the complete selection is applied (section 4.1), as a function of \(\epsilon_{b}\). No optimum can be found, but the S/B is constant around 40 when \(\epsilon_{b}<65\%\). It is also of particular importance for \(W\) polarization measurement to have the highest \(b\)-jet purity3 on the leptonic side (section 4.3). Figure 5 right shows a b-purity above 80%, with a weak dependence as a function of \(\epsilon_{b}\). The standard choice SV1+IP3D\(>\)4.5, corresponding to \(\epsilon_{b}=60\%\) with rejection factors of \(R_{u,d,s}=160\) and \(R_{c}=7\), is therefore well suited for our study. The performance are comparable to those in the fast simulation \(b\)-tagging procedure, which consists in a random tag using the following parameters: \(\epsilon_{b}=60\%\), \(R_{u,d,s}=100\), \(R_{c}=10\).

Footnote 3: \(b\)-jets are assumed to be well assigned if \(\Delta R\)(true quark, jet) \(<0.4\).

### Missing transverse momentum

The missing transverse momentum is associated to particles escaping the detection. It is calculated by retrieving the calorimeter energy in topological clusters, and compensating for energy losses upstream (in the cryostat) and carried by muons. A shift of -3% on \(\Delta p_{T}^{miss}/p_{T}^{miss}\) is corrected afterward. This in agreement with a -1.2 GeV shift reported in [21]. The p\({}_{T}^{miss}>20\) GeV cut yields an efficiency of 90%, in good agreement with fast simulation (91%).

Figure 4: _Light jets (closed symbols) and c-jets (open symbols) rejection as a function of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency. The cut is applied on the SV1+IP3D weight._

### Kinematic selection efficiency

All kinematic cuts are summarized in Table 3. Their overall efficiency on signal events is 9.5%. This is fairly well reproduced by the fast simulation (9.3%) after including lepton reconstruction efficiencies obtained in sections 3.1.1 and 3.1.2. The TopReX value 8.2% (7.6% 4) for full (fast) simulation is lower because of a smaller jet multiplicity and slightly softer p\({}_{T}\) spectra.

Footnote 4: This corresponds to the result of [3] where a lepton/jet reconstruction effi ciency of 0.9/0.95 was assumed.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c||c|c|} \hline Variables & Cuts & Efficiency (\%) \\  & & full sim & fast sim \\ \hline \hline \(=\)1 isolated lepton & p\({}_{T}\)\(>\) 20 GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) & 62 & 60.0 \\ \(\geq\) 4 jets & p\({}_{T}\)\(>\) 30 GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) & 50 & 55.7 \\ \(b\)-tagging & \(\geq\) 2 b-jets & 32 & 31.4 \\ Missing energy (v) & p\({}_{T}^{miss}\)\(>\) 20 GeV & 90 & 91.1 \\ \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c||}{Global efficiency} & 9.5 & 9.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 4 \(W\) and top polarization measurements

After kinematic cuts are applied, the event is fully reconstructed and the background contribution is estimated. Angles \(\Psi\), \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\) and \(\Phi\) are computed in \(W\) and top rest frames, and polarization parameters are extracted. The main systematic uncertainty (coming from the \(b\)-jet energy scale) is estimated with the full detector simulation and compared with fast simulation.

### \(W\) and top reconstruction

Hadronic \(W\) and top are first reconstructed. The light jet pair with \(\mathrm{M}_{jj}\) closest to the known \(W\) mass, \(\mathrm{M}_{W}\)[22], is selected to reconstruct the \(W\). The event is kept if the difference between this invariant mass and \(\mathrm{M}_{W}\) is lower than 20 GeV. The top is then retrieved using the \(b\)-tagged jet with \(\mathrm{M}_{jjb}\) closest to \(\mathrm{M}_{t}\)[22]. The remaining \(b\)-jet is used for the leptonic top reconstruction. In the 7% cases where more than two \(b\)-jets are selected, the one closest to the lepton in \(\Delta R\) is chosen. To reconstruct the leptonic \(W\), the neutrino \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) is assumed to be the missing transverse momentum. Its longitudinal component, \(\mathrm{p}_{z}\), is determined by constraining \(\mathrm{M}_{l\nu}\) to \(\mathrm{M}_{W}\):

\[\left[E^{l}+\sqrt{(p_{T}^{\nu})^{2}+(p_{z}^{\nu})^{2}}\right]^{2}-(p_{x}^{l}+ p_{x}^{\nu})^{2}-(p_{y}^{l}+p_{y}^{\nu})^{2}-(p_{z}^{l}+p_{z}^{\nu})^{2}= \mathrm{M}_{W}^{2} \tag{5}\]

When two solutions are found, the one with \(\mathrm{M}_{l\nu b}\) closest to \(\mathrm{M}_{t}\) is kept. No solution is found for one third of the events, due to \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{miss}\) resolution. A procedure to recover these events was applied in [3]. It needs more study with full simulation and is therefore not applied in the following.

Figure 6 shows the reconstructed top masses for TopReX (up) and MCatNLO (down). Fast simulation results are superimposed. A good agreement is found between generators and between full and fast simulations. Quality cuts are applied on these reconstructed masses (\(|\mathrm{M}_{t}^{had}-\mathrm{M}_{t}|<35\) GeV and \(|\mathrm{M}_{t}^{lep}-\mathrm{M}_{t}|<35\) GeV) to reject badly reconstructed events. At this stage, 2.7% of the signal events are kept, corresponding to 70000 signal events for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data (Table 4)5. Apart from \(t\bar{t}\to\tau+X\) (next section), the main background is combinatorial, caused by the selection of radiation jet and/or a wrong jet assignment6. The event purity, i.e. all particles are correctly assigned, is estimated to 64%, in good agreement with the fast simulation result (63%).

Footnote 5: This corresponds to the result of [3], obtained with TopReX, and where a recovery procedure for the events where no solution to Eq. 5 is found was applied, and a lepton/jet reconstruction effiency of 0.9/0.95 was assumed.

Footnote 6: Jets are assumed to be well assigned if \(\Delta R\)(true quark, jet) \(<0.4\)

### Background events

After selection criteria, the background is dominated by \(t\bar{t}\to\tau+X\) events, \(W(\to l\nu)+4\) jets and single top events [3]. The number of remaining events for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data is given in Table 4. A fair agreement is obtained between fast and full simulations. The background is composed for more than 80% of \(t\bar{t}\to\tau+X\) events. The non-\(t\bar{t}\) background is reduced to a low contribution, with a S/B\(\sim 40\) (Figure 5 left). It is therefore neglected in the following. The overall signal over background ratio is around 8 for both full and fast simulations.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c||c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c||}{Events for} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Selected events} \\  & 10 fb\({}^{-1}(\times 10^{6})\) & full sim & fast sim \\ \hline \hline
**Signal (\(t\bar{t}\) semileptonic)** & 2.5 & 70000 & 80000 \\ \hline \hline \(t\bar{t}\to\tau+X\) & 1.3 & 7500 & 9000 \\ \hline \hline \(W(\to lV)\)+4 jets & 12* & 900 & [200,550]** \\ single top \(Wg\) & 0.5 & 250 & 300 \\ single top \(Wt\) & 0.2 & 550 & 450 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Full (closed symbols) and fast (open symbols) simulation are superimposed on each plot. Gaussian+third order polynomial fits on full simulation samples are superimposed, from which mass and \(\sigma\) are extracted._

### \(W\) polarization

After reconstruction of the whole event, the \(\Psi\) angle (section 1) is computed using \(W\) and top rest frames on the leptonic side. The resolution on this angle is shown on Figure 6 of Ref. [17] where a very good agreement between fast and full simulations is achieved. Reconstruction and cut effects bias its distribution compared to the SM one. A correction function, obtained from the ratio of normalized reconstructed and SM distributions is then computed [3]. Given the good agreement in the kinematics of reconstructed objects observed between fast and full simulations and the poor statistics of the full simulation samples, this function is computed with fast simulation, as shown in Figure 7 left. It is then parametrized with a third order polynomial in the range \(-0.9<\cos\Psi<0.8\), where it is varying slowly, and applied event by event on the full simulation samples.

Figure 7 right shows the reconstructed \(\cos\Psi\) distribution after correction for the MCatNLO fully simulated sample. It is fitted with Eq. (1) and the constraint \(F_{0}+F_{L}+F_{R}=1\). The fit results, shown in Table 5, correspond to the SM values within the statistical errors. This assess that the method is not sensitive to fully simulated effects of a perfect detector. It is also interesting to compare full and fast simulation \(\cos\Psi\) distributions of the combinatorial background (Figure 8 left) and the \(t\bar{t}\to\tau+X\) events (Figure 8 right). Again a good agreement is obtained.

### Top spin correlation

For the top spin study, a further cut (M\({}_{t\bar{t}}<\) 550 GeV) is applied on the \(t\bar{t}\) reconstructed mass to enhance the correlation [4]. The total efficiency becomes 1.8%, corresponding to 45000 signal events for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. To extract the top spin correlation parameters \(A\) and \(A_{D}\), the

Right: Normalized reconstructed and corrected \(\cos\Psi\) distribution for the full simulation. The line corresponds to the fit with Eq. (1). Both figures are produced with MCatNLO._reconstruction of angles \(\theta_{1}\), \(\theta_{2}\) and \(\Phi\) is performed using top and \(t\bar{t}\) rest frames. The resolution on these angles are shown on Figure 6 of Ref. [17] where a very good agreement between fast and full simulations is achieved. The reconstructed angular distributions are corrected in the same way as the \(\cos\Psi\) distribution used for \(W\) polarization, using the fast simulation correction function. \(A\) and \(A_{D}\) obtained from full simulation TopReX sample (top spin correlation is not included in MCatNLO) are shown in Table 5, with their statistical errors. A good agreement is obtained between full and fast simulation for \(A_{D}\) because of smooth and small correction function. For \(A\) the disagreement is greater than 2 \(\sigma\) showing that the dependence on the correction function is more sensitive to changes from fast to full simulation. This is because the angles are computed in the \(t\bar{t}\) rest frame, more difficult to reconstruct than the top and anti-top rest frames separately. This implies that \(A\) will be harder to measure precisely in the semileptonic channel.

### Systematic uncertainties

A complete study of systematic uncertainties related to \(W\) polarization and top spin correlation measurements was reported in [3] using fast simulations. It is not possible to redo this with full simulation. One of the main contributions comes from the \(b\)-jet energy scale and is reevaluated here with full simulation samples, by miscalibrating the reconstructed \(b\)-jet energy from -6% to 6% by steps of 3%. The impact on \(W\) polarization measurement is shown in Figure 9. A good agreement is obtained with fast simulation results. For the top spin correlation parameters the agreement is worse, especially for \(A_{D}\), even if the same trend is observed (Figure 10).

Conclusions

A complete study of the \(W\) polarization and top spin correlation measurements with a fully simulated detector has been performed in the semileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) channel. An overall good agreement with fast simulation is obtained on the selection efficiency and the background estimate, yielding 70000 signal events after 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) and a signal over background ratio around 8. More details on the comparison between fast and full simulations can be found in [17]. To correct for selection and reconstruction bias, a weighting function is used. Given the good agreement between fast and full simulations, it is computed from the fast simulation and applied on fully simulated samples. Reconstructed and corrected angular distributions in \(W\) and top rest frames are used to extract polarization measurements. Results are compatible with SM values assessing the robustness of the method. The uncertainty coming from the \(b\)-jet energy scale is one of the main systematics for these polarization measurements. Results obtained with fully simulated samples are compatible with fast simulation expectations. The next step is to evaluate the impact of the trigger inefficiencies and of a more realistic detector description, including dead channels or misalignments, which will be studied with the ATLAS Computing System Commissioning (CSC) data.
