###### Abstract

Observations relating to the simulated events of the first ATLAS Blind Data Challenge. We report on the discovery of a neutral \(\mathrm{TeV}\)-scale resonance decaying to \(e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and the discovery of a heavier charged resonance decaying to \(e^{\pm}X\) and \(\mu^{\pm}X\), where \(X\) is hypothesized to be a neutrino.

## 1 Introduction

The primary web site for the ATLAS Blind Data Challenge (ABDC) is to be found at [http://phyweb.lbl.gov/blind/](http://phyweb.lbl.gov/blind/) ("**the site**"). A full description of the ABDC and its rules may be found there. Familiarity with the general purpose of the task will be assumed. We remind the reader here, however, of what each competitor is supposed to do with the mystery data:

### The brief

1. Find what was is in there [ see below for description of the data ]
2. Find what SM background was missed
3. Send SHORT note to Ian and Fabiola before September 7 saying what you have found; there is no prize for being first and you will get no feedback.

### The data

At time of writing, **the site** has a sub-page ([http://phyweb.lbl.gov/blind/data](http://phyweb.lbl.gov/blind/data)) containing the three tar files, each of which contains 100 HB0OK ntuple files. The conclusions of this note are based on these files alone.1 The ABDC web page has the following to say about the data:* The events here pass the following requirements at the generator level: Either an electron or a muon with \(p_{T}>40\) GeV and rapidity between \(-2.5\) and \(2.5\).
* Each ntuple contains roughly the same number of events and corresponds to approximately \(1.5\ \mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) and was made with ATLFAST.

On the basis of these comments, the rest of our analysis assumes that we have a total Blind Data-set (BDS) corresponding to \(450\ \mathrm{pb}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity subject to the above lepton \(p_{T}\) and rapidity requirements (hereafter referred to as the "lepton requirements" or LRs).

We note that as a direct result of the LRs, it is immediately apparent that searches in channels such as \(pp\to q\bar{q}X\) and \(pp\to q\bar{q}^{\prime}X\) are unlikely to be worth searching unless the leptons are expected to emerge from heavy top or bottom-quark decay. This is a shame, as we would be interested to look in these channels (for reasons which will become clear later) to further constrain conclusions we draw.

## 2 Investigative Plots and Preliminary Remarks

### \(m_{T}^{\mathrm{gen}}\)

The variable \(m_{T}^{\mathrm{gen}}\) (to be discussed in future work) has been designed to be a model-independent search method for finding pair-produced particles at hadron

Figure 1: The \(m_{T}^{\mathrm{gen}}\) distribution for the BDS.

colliders when those particles (or their daughters) may decay to one or more invisible particles.

The archetypal R-parity-conserving (RPC) supersymmetry (SUSY) models are examples of models where sparticle-pair production should lead to peaks or edges in the \(m_{T}^{\rm gen}\) distribution. The \(m_{T}^{\rm gen}\) distribution for the BDS fig. 1 contains no such features, so provides no evidence for an RPC SUSY model.

### \(m_{\rm eff}\)

The effective mass is defined here to be the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all jets, leptons, and the missing energy. The effective mass distribution for the BDS, and for our background samples is shown in fig. 2.

The blind distribution falls well below our generated background sample at low \(m_{\rm eff}\) (note the logarithmic scale). This may be due to missing backgrounds in the BDS, for which see section 5. The excess in the BDS at larger \(m_{\rm eff}\) may be due to poor modelling of the background. However our backgrounds generally over-estimate those in the BDS, so this excess might more correctly be interpreted as evidence for physics at the 1.5 to 2 TeV scale.

### \(n^{\rm jet}\)

The jet multiplicity distribution is plotted in fig 3, for both the BDS, and for our background samples. The overall shape of the BDS is reasonably consistent

Figure 2: The \(m_{\rm eff}\) distribution for the BDS is given by the circles. The estimated contributions from our generated backgrounds are given by the solid histograms, which are stacked, and labelled in the legend.

with that of our backgrounds, however there is a large difference (almost a factor of 10) between the normalisations. This suggests that either one or more of our estimated background cross-sections are severly over-estimated, or that one or more backgrounds are absent in the BDS.

### Photons

The photon multiplicity in the BDS (fig 4) exceeds that in our background samples The total energy in photons shows a large deficit in the BDS at low \(p_{T}\), and a large excess at high \(p_{T}\).

Figure 5 shows the fraction of the energy in the event carried by photons. This fraction is about 1/100 in the BDS, but only 1/1000 in our generated background samples. This could indicate a difference in the method of photon identification between the two samples.

The \(E_{T}\) distribution of the hardest photon (RHS of fig 4) shows no excess, thus provides no hint of new physics at high scale.

### \(p_{T}^{\rm miss}\)

The missing transverse momentum distribution (fig 6) shows a deficit in the BDS at low \(p_{T}^{\rm miss}\), and an excess at higher \(p_{T}^{\rm miss}\).

### Searches for resonances

Figure 7 shows the inclusive dijet invariant mass of the two highest energy jets in both the BDS and our background samples.

Figure 6: The distribution of the missing transverse momentum variable, \(p_{T}^{\rm miss}\).

Figure 7: Inclusive dijet (LHS) and di-photon invariant mass distributions in both the BDS and our background samples.

No major discrepancies are observed in the b-jet multiplicity and \(p_{T}\) distributions shown in figure 8.

Figure 11 shows no resonance in the electron+muon invariant mass spectrum. Also no peak in the \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) spectrum at around 5.4 GeV, which could have been indicative of the rare decay \(B_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\).

Figure 9 shows the preliminary investigative dilepton invariant mass distributions which were obtained from the BDS in the electron pair and muon pair channels. The immediately obvious feature present in both plots is the concentration of events at invariant masses close to 1280 GeV, for which the Standard Model (SM) offers no explanation. This new resonance (or these new resonances) will be studied in more detail in section 3. No similar resonances are seen in \(e\mu\) or doubly charged channels; see for example figure 10.

### Transverse mass distributions

The transverse mass distributions for the electron and muon are shown in figure 12. The BDS distributions are not monatonically decreasing, and have an excess in the region 1000 to 1800 GeV.

The transverse mass distributions for the highest energy jet is shown in figure 13.

The transverse mass distributions for the highest energy photon is shown in the LHS of figure 14. The BDS is clearly not well described by the SM background samples, as it contains many more events with large photon transverse mass. However there is _no_ clear edge in the BDS distribution which might indicate a decay of the form \((X\to Y\gamma)\), where \(X\) and \(Y\) are unknown particles and \(Y\) is an invisible particle which escapes the detector.

On scanning event displays one gets the impression that these events are of a similar nature to those known to contain boosted W bosons (containing high \(p_{T}\) leptons in association with the missing energy) produced in association with a

The fitted gaussian is only there to guide the eye and provide a rough estimate of the location of the non-SM peak located in each plot. The dielectron fit has a peak position of about 1280.

little jet activity.

A simple search for the decay \(X\to W\gamma\), where the \(W\) decays leptonically was performed, by plotting the transverse mass distribution of the photon plus the electron, which may have come from the \(W\) (RHS of figure 14). Again there is no edge which might indicate the presence of a new particle.

It is informative to note that the excess in the BDS can be removed by requiring a cut that the scalar sum of jet \(E_{T}\) be small (less than about 100 GeV). This leads us to believe that these events are, as in the single photon case, most likely to be the result of misidentification of jets or jet fragments as photons.

### General comments

Our background samples do not describe the BDS shapes particularly well:

* The BDS has a much larger photon multiplicity in events with jets, which may be caused for example by mis-identification of \(\pi^{0}\)
* The BDS generally has more activity at high scale than does the background sample. This may be due to large differences in PDF's or some sort of biasing
* The BDS has a deficit at low scale which could indicate one or more missing SM channels. This is discussed in section 5.

Some of the BDS distributions show features which could be indicative of physics at the TeV scale. These distributions are investigated further in sections 3 and 4.

## 3 Investigating the neutral dilepton resonance in more detail

Having observed in section 2.6 preliminary indications of one or more non-SM neutral dilepton resonances, we will now attempt to study them in more detail. First we will attempt to obtain a cleaner samples of events than those presented in section 2.6. Then, in each observed decay mode (_i.e._\(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\)), we aim to measure:

1. the mass of the resonance,
2. the full width, and
3. the cross section times branching ratio.

### Line shape

We begin by assuming that in the vicinity of the peak, the line-shape of the resonance will be well modelled by a Breit-Wigner line-shape, _i.e._:

\[\frac{d\sigma}{dm_{ll}}\propto\frac{1}{(m_{ll}-M)^{2}+\Gamma^{2}/4}. \tag{1}\]

Detector resolution effects mean that it is important to convolve this shape with a resolution function which we will take to be a gaussian with a decay-mode specific width which is determined later.

### Better cuts

Before we can fit the above line-shape to the BDS we must first select a reasonably pure sample of events. We start by using the following set of cuts to home in on what is likely to contain the signal(s) intimated in figure 9.

* Require events to contain precisely two reconstructed electrons (or muons), and require that they have opposite sign.
* Veto events containing any reconstructed b-jets, c-jets or taus.
* Veto events containing any reconstructed jets with \(p_{T}>100\) GeV.
* Finally, we only consider events in which the reconstructed \(m_{ll}\) satisfies \(1000<m_{ll}<1600\) GeV.2 Footnote 2: This range was chosen on the basis of figure 9.

Furthermore, we choose to reassert the LRs as detector-level cuts (remember that we are told that they are already asserted in the data at generator level). This step is not particularly important; we just do it so that we can better consider the LRs as a genuine "trigger".

### Detector resolution

In order to extract not only the mass but also the full width from the BDS, we must make a good determination of the detector resolution for events in the peaks. This we do by generating a set of events of our own corresponding to a resonance of known mass and width, and then determining the amount by which the Breit-Wigner form of equation (1) must be smeared in order to then best model the line-shape. The simplest resonance we could choose to simulate would be a \(Z^{\prime}\)-boson

Figure 15: Reconstructed \(m_{ll}\) distributions (after detector simulation) for a 1280 GeV spin-1 infinitely narrow resonance decaying to electron pairs (left) and muon pairs (right) as modelled by ATLFAST. On the basis of these plots we conclude that for neutral resonances of this mass, the \(ee\)-resolution is approximately 7.6 GeV, and the \(\mu\mu\)-resolution is approximately 77 GeV.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

ant mass distributions measured after this process may be seen in figure 15. On the basis of these plots we conclude that for neutral resonances of this mass, the _ee_-resolution is approximately 7.6 GeV, and the \(\mu\mu\)-resolution is approximately 77 GeV.

### Tests

To demonstrate reliability in the proposed method, and to confirm the estimates of detector resolution obtained in figure 15, we then attempt to recover the masses and widths of a pair of resonances of **known** mass and width. The results of these fits are shown in figure 16 and constitute compelling evidence that there is nothing "horrendously" wrong with the method; the widths obtained from the fits are all consistent with the true values to within errors of less than 1.5 sigma, and in most cases are consistent at less than 1.0 sigma. There is a little evidence for a slight positive bias in the central values of the fitted masses; the amount by which the fitted mass exceeds the true mass in each plot in figure 16 in turn is 0.38%, 0.54%, 1.1% and 0.31%. To understand better whether this is a) simply statistical fluctuation or b) a real detector effect (perhaps caused by small changes in detector acceptance over the range of dilepton masses observed) would require more work to be done.

If as a result of further study it were found that these excesses _were_ due to a systematic effect, one would attempt to correct for it. On the basis of the data available at present, one would imagine accomplishing this by decreasing fitted masses by the mean offset (0.58%) which would leave a quoted _systematic_ error on the "corrected" masses at the level of the root of the variance estimate; at present 0.36%. For resonances with masses around 1.3 TeV these would correspond to a downward correction of 7.5 GeV and a quoted systematic error of \(\pm 4.7\) GeV.

In the absence of such further study, however, we will _not_ make any correction to the fitted masses. We will simply quote a larger systematic error, equal to the RMS of the offsets, namely \(\pm 0.66\)%, which corresponds to \(\pm 8.6\) GeV for masses of the order 1.3 TeV.

### Resulting mass and width measurements

We now return to the events in the BDS. Using the cuts described in section 3.2 and the fitting procedure described above, we obtain the fits shown in figure 17. The bottom line is that we obtain the result:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Channel & Fitted mass (GeV) & fitted width (GeV) \\ \hline _ee_ & \(12\,94\pm 5.7\pm 8.6\) & \(46\pm 12\pm\)? \\ \(\mu\mu\) & 1279 \(\pm\) 18 \(\pm\) 8.6 & \(48\pm 33\pm\)? \\ \hline Combined & \(12\,92\pm 5.4\pm 8.6\) & \(46\pm 11\pm\)? \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Note that no serious attempt has been made to estimate the size of the systematic error in the measurement of the width.

### Spin determination

#### Principle of measurement

Next on the agenda we would like to see if we can make any statement about the spin of the neutral dilepton resonance. On the face of it, all we need to do to measure the spin of the resonance is to plot the distribution of \(\cos\theta\) where \(\theta\) is the angle, in the rest frame or the resonance, between the emitted antilepton and one of the incoming protonic quarks (say the one from the positive \(z\) direction). If this distribution were flat we would identify the resonance as a scalar, or if \(1+\cos^{2}\theta\) as spin-1, etc. Given that we are looking at electron- and muon-pair production, we hopefully do not need to consider non-integer spin! Not having direct access to the quark momentum, we approximate it by the momentum of one of the protons, which effectively corresponds to making the assumption that the quark carries negligible transverse momentum within the proton. We must either be prepared to tolerate the modifications to the expected distribution shapes caused by this "extraction from the proton", or else simulate the whole process in a montecarlo and fit the simulation to the data. Regardless of the method chosen, MC will still be needed to model the detector acceptance.

#### A calibration with a surprise

Not wishing to rely too heavily on our own MC for the spin determination, our first instinct was to measure the spin of one of the SM particles in the BDS to first validate our method. We hoped to use this as a calibration for the subsequent measurement of the spin of the new resonance. To this end it was decided to measure the spin of the SM \(Z\)-bosons in the BDS from \(q\overline{q}\to Z/\gamma^{*}\to l\overline{l}\) (Drell-Yan). It came as a complete shock, then, to find that the \(\cos\theta\) distributions obtained from the BDS (see figure 18) were all completely flat! To begin with we thought this to be evidence of shocking disagreement with the SM; the \(Z\)-boson seemed to be a scalar!

Figure 17: Reconstructed \(m_{ll}\) distributions (after detector simulation) produced from the events of the BDS after the cuts described in section 3.2. Events in which the resonance decays to electron pairs are shown on the left, and muon pairs on the right.

Figure 18: These four plots show attempts to measure the spin-1 nature of the Standard Model \(Z\)-boson by looking at di-electron events within 10 GeV of the \(Z\)-peak in the BDS. The top two plots include all events, regardless of the rapidity of the reconstructed \(Z\). In fact, the second plot on the top row shows how the \(\cos\theta\) distribution (horizontal axis) varies in bins of rapidity (vertical axis). The bottom two plots show only those satisfying the stronger rapidity constraints \(-1.0<y_{ee}<+1.0\) (left) and \(-0.5<y_{ee}<+0.5\) (right). The main result, however you look at it, is that the distributions are all **flat** in \(\cos\theta\). This is, of course, not what you would expect for Drell-Yan \(Z\)-production (see figure 19)

Figure 19: Ignore the top two plots (which are for \(p\overline{p}\) collisions). The plots in the bottom row are generated from a sample events produced by Drell-Yan \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) production at the LHC. Events were selected with the requirement that \(m_{ee}\) lie within 4 GeV of the \(Z\)-mass. The bottom-right plot, which in addition requires that the rapidity of the reconstructed \(Z\) lie between \(\pm 0.5\), shows the classic \(1+\cos^{2}\theta\) form we expect for a spin-1 particle. The bottom-left plot shows why the strong rapidity cut is needed in order to see this \(1+\cos^{2}\theta\) form; it shows that there is almost no acceptance in the corners of the plot. This is understandable; bearing in mind that a Drell-Yan \(Z\) is twice as likely to decay along the beam-line as at right angles to it, one of them produced at high rapidity will be highly inclined to throw one of the two decay products out of the detector. In this and subsequent plots we always make a strong central rapidity requirement to make the spin plots easier to interpret.

### A missing background clue

Rapidly, however, this conclusion was discounted when it was realized that there were far fewer events in the \(Z\)-peak than would be expected from Drell-Yan \(Z\) production alone, and then it became apparent that this was the first intimation that Drell-Yan \(Z\) production was (at least one component of) the "missing SM background" referred to in the ABDC brief. We attribute, therefore, the flat \(\cos\theta\) distributions that were observed in the BDS for leptons in the \(Z\)-peak to be due to \(Z\)-bosons produced either as "secondary" particles or in production associated with jets or other particles. Either of these possibilities should be sufficient to destroy almost all correlation between the directions of the proton beams and the momenta of the particles immediately involved in the production of the secondary \(Z\). As a check, we confirm that we **can** measure the spin of the SM \(Z\) by exactly the same technique when we generate our own MC sample of Drell-Yan \(Z\) production (see figure 19). In the light of this discovery, the extent to which this background was missing was investigated by more detailed simulation of the expected backgrounds. More evidence that this process is missing from the BDS is presented in section 5.

Regrettably, then, the absence of the Drell-Yan \(Z\) production in the BDS means that to measure the spin of the resonance we will have to rely on comparison with our own MC to a greater extent than we would like to.

### Consistent with spin-0

The \(\cos\theta\) distributions we find for the events in the new neutral dilepton resonance are to be found in figure 20. It is clear that the limited statistics make it hard to make definite statements about the spin of the resonance, however, by eye alone one can easily see from the flatness of the distributions that the resonance is consistent with being spin-0.

### What about non-zero spin?

Fractional spins should be impossible given the final state we are producing. They are not discussed further. What about spin-1? Reliant on the MC for the reasons discussed above, we have generated for ourselves samples of \(Z^{\prime}\) events with mass and width consistent with our best measurement of the edge. The \(\cos\theta\) distribution obtained from this sample is shown in figure 21. The \(\cos\theta\) distributions obtained in the BDS were then compared to these known spin-1 ones using a Kolmogorov test. This was done separately for the di-muon and the di-electron channels. The result was that the events in the electron channel are only consistent with spin-1 at the 4% level, while in the muon channel the consistency with spin-1 is somewhat better, but still only at 18%. Although bad, this level of consistency is not really good enough to _rule out_ spin-1, but it certainly _disfavours_ it with respect to the spin-0 alternative. More statistics will be needed to resolve the issue.

No attempt has been made to interpret the data in the context of spins greater than or equal to two. It seems unlikely that we would have sufficient statistics to discern the quartic "\(1-3\cos^{2}\theta+4\cos^{4}\theta\)" form of a fermionically produced and fermionically decaying spin-2 resonance in any case.

Figure 21: A typical \(\cos\theta\) distribution obtained from sample of \(q\overline{q}\to\gamma^{*}ZZ^{\prime}\to l\overline{l}\) events generated with \(M_{Z^{\prime}}\) and \(\Gamma_{Z^{\prime}}\) set equal to the values measured in the neutral dilepton resonance seen in the BDS.

Figure 20: This figure shows the \(\cos\theta\) distributions for sub-sets of the lepton pair events in figure 17, _i.e._ those events in the BDS which pass the cuts described in section 3.2 which are designed to select events containing the new neutral dilepton resonance. The top two plots do not have any further restrictions on rapidity, however the bottom left plot is a bit more stringent, requiring in addition \(-1.0<y_{ll}<+1.0\), while the bottom right plot is even more strict requiring \(-0.625<y_{ll}<+0.625\).

### Cross sections

There are 38 \(e,e\) and 32 \(\mu,\mu\) events in the neutral resonance peak from the BDS which has a total integrated luminosity of 450 pb\({}^{-1}\). The backgrounds in these regions are very small and so are neglected.

In order to estimate the detector acceptance, we generated with 2000 \(Z^{\prime}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events, with HERWIG (\(M=1280\) GeV, CM energy \(>1000\) GeV, \(\Gamma=50\) GeV, \(\sigma=0.135\) pb). Approximately 1244 of these events were found within the similar peak position, indicating that the cross-section times branching ratio to \(e^{+}e^{-}\) for the BDS, is given by

\[\sigma(X^{0})\times BR(X^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-})=\frac{2000}{1244}\times 38/450=0.136 \pm 0.022\ \mathrm{pb}.\]

A similar analysis of the decay of the neutral resonance to the _muon_ channel gives:

\[\sigma(X^{0})\times BR(X^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=\frac{2000}{1227}\times 3 2/450=0.116\pm 0.020\ \mathrm{pb}.\]

These values are all consistant with the (HERWIG) prediction for the \(Z^{\prime}\) which we used for the acceptance sample, which had couplings equal to that of the SM \(Z^{0}\).

## 4 Investigating the high leptonic transverse-mass tail in more detail

### Cuts

The cuts used in the electron channel to examine in more detail the high transverse-mass tail first identified in figure 12 were as follows:

* Require \(n_{e}\geq 1\),
* Require \(p_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}>200\) GeV,
* Veto any event with a jet with energy greater than one quarter of the energy of the hardest electron.

The cuts for the muon channel were similarly constructed. The effects that these cuts have on the events in the BDS and on our expectation of the SM are shown in figure 22. Note that this figure provides support for the suggestion of section 5 that the BDS lacks Drell-Yan \(W\) production. This makes it slightly easier for us to measure the position of the edge of the transverse mass distributions, as we can assume virtually no background events in the signal above 500 GeV or so. If the BDS _were_ to contain the necessary backgrounds, it seems unlikely that this would actually change the accuracy with which the end points could eventually be measured (they are well away from the edge) but it would require the analysis to take more care than we subsequently implement.

### Theoretical line shape

Ignoring for the moment detector effects (resolutions, acceptances etc) but attempting to take into account the effects of the proton's parton distribution functions, we calculate that the \(m_{T}\) distributions for charged resonances in the mass range 1 to 2 TeV should be reasonably well modelled by the line-shape

\[f(m_{T};M,\Gamma)\propto M\,\Gamma\,\left(-4\,{m_{T}}^{2}+3\,\left(M^{2}+\Gamma ^{2}\right)\right)+\frac{\sqrt{2}\,{m_{T}}\,A^{5}}{\sqrt{\left({m_{T}}^{2}-M^{ 2}\right)^{2}+M^{2}\,\Gamma^{2}}}, \tag{2}\]

where

\[A^{10} = -{m_{T}}^{6}\,M^{4}+5\,{m_{T}}^{4}\,M^{6}-8\,{m_{T}}^{2}\,M^{8}+ 4\,M^{10}+6\,{m_{T}}^{6}\,M^{2}\,\Gamma^{2}\,-\] \[18\,{m_{T}}^{4}\,M^{4}\,\Gamma^{2}+16\,{m_{T}}^{2}\,M^{6}\, \Gamma^{2}\,-4\,M^{8}\,\Gamma^{2}\,-{m_{T}}^{6}\,\Gamma^{4}\,-\] \[7\,{m_{T}}^{4}\,M^{2}\,\Gamma^{4}+24\,{m_{T}}^{2}\,M^{4}\,\Gamma^ {4}\,-20\,M^{6}\,\Gamma^{4}\,-12\,M^{4}\,\Gamma^{6}\,+\] \[\left(M^{2}+\Gamma^{2}\right)^{2}\sqrt{\left({m_{T}}^{2}-M^{2} \right)^{2}+M^{2}\,\Gamma^{2}}\,\left(\left({m_{T}}^{2}-2\,M^{2}\right)^{2}+4 \,M^{2}\,\Gamma^{2}\right).\]

Further we can attempt to parametrize detector resolution by smearing \(f\) of equation 2 with a gaussian resolution function:

\[f(m_{T};M,\Gamma,\sigma_{\rm res})\propto\int_{-\,\infty}^{\infty}f(t;M,\Gamma )e^{-(t-m_{T})^{2}/2\sigma_{\rm res}^{2}}{\rm d}t. \tag{3}\]

The remaining dominant discrepancy between this function and the data it is supposed to model will probably be due to acceptance corrections which it makes no attempt to model.

### Determining the \(m_{T}\) resolutions

In order to determine the resolutions for \(m_{T}\) measurements in the 1 to 2 TeV part of the \(m_{Te}\) and \(m_{T\mu}\) tails, we take the same approach as for the neutral resonance.

Figure 22: BDS \(m_{Te}\) and \(m_{T\mu}\) distributions after the cuts of section 4.1.

We simulate some events containing a straw-model charged resonance (in fact a \(W^{\prime}\)-boson) with known mass and width, and then fit with the expected shape (see equation (3)) keeping the generated width \(\Gamma\) fixed at its known true value, and letting the best-fit determine the values of \(\sigma^{e}_{\rm res}\) and \(\sigma^{\mu}_{\rm res}\) for us. The results of this fit are shown in figure 23. The resolutions obtained are \(\sigma^{e}_{\rm res}=32\pm 12\) GeV and \(\sigma^{\mu}_{\rm res}=254\pm 18\) GeV.

### Check: does the fit work properly?

To check that the fit process described above (using the now fixed resolutions obtained in figure 23) works as desired, we perform the reverse process, and use the fit process to attempt to give us back the known mass and width of the 1800 GeV \(W^{\prime}\)-sample that we generated ourselves. The results of this test are to be found in figure 24 and may be summarized by saying that the method appears to be in good health. There is some evidence that the width measurements may be relied upon, and there is evidence that (presumably due to unmodelled acceptance effects) the mass measurement is good, but systematically slightly low (\(\sim 1\%\)). On the basis of these plots, we expect to be able to compensate for the slight systematic shift by multiplying the masses found in "bare fits" by a factor of 1.008 in the electron channel, and 1.022 in the muon channel. Measurements corrected in this way will be termed "calibrated".

Figure 23: Leptonic transverse mass distributions from a generated \(W^{\prime}\) sample of events with \(M_{W^{\prime}}=1800\) and \(\Gamma_{W^{\prime}}=58\) which have passed through ATLFAST. The cuts are those of section 4.1. \(W^{\prime}\to e\nu_{e}\) events are in the plot on the LHS, and \(W^{\prime}\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\) events on the RHS. These plots were fitted with the distribution expected from theory (a function of \(M_{W^{\prime}}\) and \(\Gamma_{W^{\prime}}\); see equation (3)) which includes a smearing by a gaussian detector-resolution function of size \(\sigma_{\rm res}\). The purpose of this fit was to determine the size of \(\sigma^{e}_{\rm res}\) and \(\sigma^{\mu}_{\rm res}\). Accordingly \(\Gamma_{W^{\prime}}\) was fixed at its known true value, and only \(M_{W^{\prime}}\) (P1) and \(\sigma_{\rm res}\) (P2) were allowed to vary. It may be seen that the results obtained were \(\sigma^{e}_{\rm res}=32\pm 12\) GeV and \(\sigma^{\mu}_{\rm res}=254\pm 18\) GeV.

### Fitting the events from the BDS

Finally we are in a position to make a measurement of the mass and width of the charged resonance seen in the BDS. The fits to the BDS events passing the cuts of section 4.1 are shown in figure 25. The figure caption lists the **uncalibrated masses** and widths extracted from the fit. If we increase these masses by the scalings obtained in section 4.4, we obtain the calibrated result:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Channel & Fitted mass (GeV) & fitted width (GeV) \\ \hline \(e\) & \(1667\pm 35\pm 17\) & \(186\pm 77\pm?\) \\ \(\mu\) & \(1743\pm 73\pm 17\) & \(327\pm 160\pm?\) \\ \hline Combined & \(1681\pm 32\pm 17\) & \(212\pm 70\pm?\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} We remark that the systematic errors on the mass measurements were simply set at 1% on the basis that the electron and muon recalibrations differed by approximately this amount. We recognize that this is a bit crude! Note that no serious attempt has been made to estimate the size of the systematic error in the measurement of the width.

### Other checks

The recalibrations of the previous section and the arbitrariness of the systematic error determination are a little dis-satisfactory. A crude check was implemented by attempting to fit the BDS not with the smooth function, but instead with

Figure 24: Leptonic transverse mass distributions from a generated \(W^{\prime}\) sample of events with \(M_{W^{\prime}}=1800\) and \(\Gamma_{W^{\prime}}=58\) which have passed through ATLFAST. The cuts are those of section 4.1. \(W^{\prime}\to e\nu_{e}\) events are in the plot on the LHS, and \(W^{\prime}\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\) events on the RHS. Making use of the detector resolutions that were obtained earlier from figure 23, the distributions have been re-fitted with free parameters \(M_{W^{\prime}}^{\rm fit}\) (P1) and \(\Gamma_{W^{\prime}}^{\rm fit}\) (P2) to check that these parameters are then correctly recovered from the data. It is apparent that the values of \(M_{W^{\prime}}^{\rm fit}\) which were obtained are systematically low by a small amount (order 1%) which may have to be compensated for in later measurements, but it is clear that the fitted value \(\Gamma_{W^{\prime}}^{\rm fit}\) is consistent with the simulated \(\Gamma_{W^{\prime}}\).

montexlo data itself. Some samples of MC data were simulated corresponding to a range of \(W^{\prime}\) masses between 1.5 and 1.8 TeV. With interpolation, it was then possible to obtain electron and muon transverse mass distributions for any \(W^{\prime}\) mass within the simulated range. Unfortunately we were not able to vary the width of the \(W^{\prime}\) independently of its mass, so all our samples had \(\Gamma_{W^{\prime}}\approx 58\) GeV. We would have preferred to use a larger width so as to be more consistent with the BDS (at least in as much as the smooth fits appear to favour a larger width) but we have made do with the samples we obtained. Best fits (with the \(M_{W^{\prime}}\) as the sole free parameter) are shown in figure 26. The fit to the electron spectrum looks reasonable, but the fit to the muon spectrum seems pretty poor, both by eye, and from the chi-squared: 37/25. Nevertheless, it is reassuring to see that despite these problems, the fitted masses obtained are \(1692\pm 20\) and \(1718\pm 33\) in the electron and muon channels respectively, and these values are _completely_ consistent with those obtained by the first method.3

Footnote 3: Remember that if the widths were also allowed to vary in these fits then presumably the error in the fitted mass would increase to the level it is in the fits obtained using the earlier “smooth fit” method.

### Cross sections

We evaluate the cross sections for the charged resonance using the same method as for the neutral resonance described in section 3.7.

The acceptance for the charged resonance (decaying to a single lepton and an invisible particle, assumed to be a neutrino) was calculated from one of our own

Figure 25: Leptonic transverse mass distributions from the events in the BDS passing the cuts of section 4.1. Events observed in the electron channel are in the plot on the LHS, and events from the muon channel on the RHS. The type of fit is identical to that described in figure 24 and again takes into account the resolutions obtained from figure 23. The (uncalibrated) results of the fit(s) are \(M_{e-{\rm channel}}^{\rm fit}=1653\pm 35\), \(M_{\mu-{\rm channel}}^{\rm fit}=1704\pm 73\), \(\Gamma_{e-{\rm channel}}^{\rm fit}=186\pm 80\) and \(\Gamma_{\mu-{\rm channel}}^{\rm fit}=327\pm 164\). All values are in GeV.

PYTHIA \(W^{\prime}\) samples (\(M=1800\) GeV, \(\Gamma=58\) GeV, \(\sigma=3.8\) pb).4 We find:

Footnote 4: We assume that in PYTHIA the \(W^{\prime}\) decays to all quark-pair generations. If in fact it decays to only two generations, our \(W^{\prime}\) cross-section results must be reinterpreted, multiplying by a factor of 1.34.

\[\sigma(X^{\pm})\times BR(X^{\pm}\to{}^{i}\nu^{\prime}_{e}e^{\pm}) = \frac{1600}{927}\times 71/450=0.27\pm 0.03\ \mbox{pb}\quad\mbox{ and}\] \[\sigma(X^{\pm})\times BR(X^{\pm}\to{}^{i}\nu^{\prime}_{\mu}\mu^{ \pm}) = \frac{1600}{953}\times 87/450=0.29\pm 0.03\ \mbox{pb},\]

where the errors are statistical only. The uncertainty in the number of background would be unphysically low if the Drell-Yan backgrounds are indeed missing as suggested in 5.

## 5 Missing Background

Background studies and evaluation were performed on control distributions using 900 inverse picobarns of dominant backgrounds expected to pass the lepton filter put at generator level: a selected event contains at least one electron or one muon with transverse momentum larger than 40 GeV and absolute pseudorapidity smaller than 2.5. We used PYTHIA 6.203 [1] to generate the following event samples:

* Neutral and Charged Drell-Yan interactions,
* W+jet and Z+jet.
* boson pairs: WW, WZ, ZZ
* top pairs.

Figure 26: Figures 23 to 25 all used the smooth function \(f(m_{T};M,\Gamma)\) defined in equation (3) to fit the data. In contrast, the plots shown in **this** figure were fitted using a discretely approximated function which was obtained by interpolating between histograms of distributions of the transverse mass from MC simulations over a range of \(W^{\prime}\)-bosons with masses between 1500 and 1800 GeV.

Figure 28: Transverse mass distributions with electron (left) and muon (right). Blind dataset is shown by big dots, colored histograms stand for the different background species generated.

Figure 27: Dielectron (left) and dimuon (right) mass distributions around the Z mass. Blind dataset is shown by big dots, colored histograms st and for the different background species generated.

The first control distributions we are looking at are the dilepton mass around the Z peak, shown in figure 27.

From the dilepton masses, we can see that neutral Drell-Yan interactions are missing from the data. A relatively good agreement between the blind dataset is found with the rest of the backgrounds.

Neutral Drell-Yan was also found to be missing using a spin analysis, described elsewhere in this report (see section 3.6). The second set of control distributions is the transverse mass from the most energetic lepton and the missing transverse momentum, shown in figure 28.

Neutral Drell-Yan interactions have been removed from these plots as they are no longer expected. We can see that the charged Drell-Yan interactions are also excluded, even though the background description is very bad: the W peak is strongly enhanced and the sidebands are depleted with respect to the blind data sample, which is probably due to the limited matrix elements used for W+jet simulation. We tried to use HERWIG [2] to have a better agreement, but unfortunately with limited success.

Nevertheless, if we integrate all contributions (except Drell-Yan), we recover a good agreement with the data. This effect is also seen in other distributions like the missing transverse momentum.

## 6 Summary and Conclusions

We make two main discoveries in the data which we cannot explain on the basis of the SM. These discoveries take the form of a new neutral resonance and a new charged resonance. In addition we identify an absence of charged and neutral Drell-Yan events in the BDS.

The resonances are observed only in electron and muon channels. Given that the events in the BDS have all been required to pass a strong "electron or muon" requirement at generator level, we cannot conclude anything from the non-observation of the resonances in other channels such as \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\), \(\tau\nu\), \(\gamma\gamma\), \(t\overline{b}\) and \(b\overline{b}\). Preliminary investigations into these channels were nevertheless conducted (not all described herein) on the off-chance that a little more would be allowed into the BDS than we were actually being told about. However, as expected, nothing was found.

### Neutral resonance

The neutral resonance was observed in its decays to \(e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). For both of the decay modes, the masses, widths and "cross section times branching ratios" were all observed to be consistent with each other, leading to the interpretation of this as a _single_ neutral resonance with generation blind couplings to leptons.

The bullet point summary for the measured parameters of the neutral resonance is as follows:

* \(M=129\,2\pm 5.4\pm 8.6\) GeV,
* \(\Gamma=46\pm 11\pm\)? GeV,
* \(\sigma(X^{0})\times BR(X^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-})=0.136\pm 0.022\) pb,
* \(\sigma(X^{0})\times BR(X^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=0.116\pm 0.020\) pb,
* Spin: scalar (favoured) or spin-1 (disfavoured but still possible)

### Charged resonance

The charged resonance was observed in its decays to \(e^{\pm}X\) and \(\mu^{\pm}X\) where \(X\) is a missing particle or particles. Missing energy spectra do not provide evidence for missing _massive_ particles or groups of massive or massless particles, so we have assumed that \(X\) may be taken to be a neutrino or similar particle. We have made no effort to make measurements of charge asymmetry in production.

For both of the decay modes, the masses, widths and "cross section times branching ratios" were again observed to be consistent with each other, leading to the interpretation of this as a _single_ charged resonance with generation blind couplings to leptons.

The bullet point summary for the measured parameters of the charged resonance is as follows:

* \(M=1681\pm 32\pm 17\) GeV,
* \(\Gamma=212\pm 70\pm\)? GeV,
* \(\sigma(X^{\pm})\times BR(X^{\pm}\rightarrow\mbox{`}\nu^{\prime}_{e}e^{\pm})=0. 27\pm 0.03\) pb,
* \(\sigma(X^{\pm})\times BR(X^{\pm}\rightarrow\mbox{`}\nu^{\prime}_{\mu}\mu^{\pm})=0. 29\pm 0.03\) pb,
* Spin: was not measured, but is presumably integral given the likely final state!

### Conjectures...

We would regard the content of the preceding sections as the "real" conclusions of this note, however it is interesting to speculate about the physics which could have produced these new resonances. What follows should be considered purely conjectural.

The generation blindness of the decay modes would appear to disfavour an explanation involving heavy charged or neutral higgses. Given the favoured spin-0 character of the neutral resonance it would be tempting to try to explain the observations as single \(s\)-channel slepton production-and-decay via non-zero \(R\)-parity-violating \(\lambda\) and \(\lambda^{\prime}\) couplings. Unfortunately this explanation also fails when it is observed that the mass splitting between the charged and neutral sleptons would have to be much greater than the order \(M_{W}\) that sum-rules would permit. Perhaps a graviton resonance might try to explain the neutral resonance in an extra-dimensional model, but to claim discovery of one of these would require more compelling evidence of spin-2 and/or evidence of higher excited modes, neither of which we have sufficient statistics to provide. Furthermore, a graviton hypothesis would totally fail to help explain the charged resonance, so all in all we feel it also needs to be dropped.

The only remaining commonly-studied model(s) of which we are aware which seem to be a reasonable match for the data are models with extra gauge bosons. We have already seen that the number of observed events in both muon and electron channels is consistent with the HERWIG prediction for a \(Z^{\prime}\)-boson of mass approximately 1280 GeV, width 50 GeV and with couplings equal to those of the SM \(Z\), with the one exception of the spin, which is "only-just" consistent. If required to plump for a single option, we would feel compelled to conclude that the "least-worst" fit to the neutral resonance data is provided by the assumption that it comes from a \(Z^{\prime}\)-boson. To explain the spin measurement, then, we would either have to assume that the object is not a vector boson after all (perhaps just a lone graviton resonance) or else assume that we "got unlucky with the statistics" and that the effect would disappear given more data.

At the same time, the general kinematic structure of the events of the charged resonance seem well modelled by the hypothesis that these are from \(W^{\prime}\)-boson decays. It is unfortunate that our technical problems with PYTHIA, which have prevented us from setting the widths of \(W^{\prime}\) resonances at will,5 mean that we cannot make a precise statement about the consistency of the absolute number of charged events within a given \(W^{\prime}\) scenario. Nevertheless, we can say that we believe there to be sufficient flexibility within models with \(W^{\prime}\)-bosons to account for the observations in the BDS.

Footnote 5: not insurmountable problems, just one that we don’t feel like surmounting right now...
