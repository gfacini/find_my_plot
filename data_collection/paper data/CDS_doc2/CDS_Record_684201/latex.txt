**Abstract**

The Milano group realized an apparatus that reproduces a small part of the electromagnetic calorimeter barrel. It consists of four electrodes sandwiched among five absorbers, and connected together by summing boards, with the possibility of injecting electrical pulses at the electrode and summing board level, thus allowing to mimic signals produced by electromagnetic cascades or injected by the calibration network. This note describes in detail the apparatus and presents first results on the understanding of the signal waveforms and amplitudes, in terms of the characteristic parameters of the apparatus. Electrical models of the detector are also proposed and discussed. The effects of the asymmetry in the ground reference configuration of some back summing boards are also investigated, and proved to provide a distortion of at most 1.6% on the calibrated signal amplitude.

Introduction

The beam tests performed in years 1999 and 2000 on the Module-0 of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter barrel (EMB) showed the existance of a large disuniformity at the level of RMS = 2% in the energy response of the detector, with a regular pattern as a function of the pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) coordinate.

A common effort, involving people from several scientific institutions (LAL, LAPP, BNL, Univ. of Pittsburgh and Univ. & INFN of Milano) has been undertaken to understand the origin of this anomaly, and there is now a general consensus that it is to be sought in the electrical properties of the detector and its readout chain, which need to be investigated in more detail. Clearly, a naive electrical model that describes each detector channel as a bare L-C circuit is inadequate. However, a complete model accounting for all the parameters would be too complex to be handled with a reasonable confidence. Therefore, it is necessary to build a hardware model, as similar as possible to the real calorimeter, to test the various simulation models adopted.

In this scenario, the Milano group realized an apparatus that reproduces a small part of the EMB. It contains four electrodes sandwiched among five absorbers, and connected together by summing boards. Exponential electric signals can be injected on the summing board as calibration pulses, or directly on the electrodes to mimic the electromagnetic cascades. The signals can be acquired on an oscilloscope and analysed, and correlations with the detector parameters (capacitances and inductances of the different channels) can be investigated. This note describes the apparatus layout and the first results obtained, with particular focus on the signal waveforms and amplitudes and comparisons with values predicted by simulations.

In Section 2 the basics concepts of the EMB detector and the level of understanding are briefly recalled. The basic electrical model for a detector channel is described in Section 3; its limitations are discussed, and more detailed models are proposed, which will be used for interpreting the measurements performed on the system. Section 4 describes the details of the apparatus layout and the instrumentation used. The method used for measuring the electrical parameters (capacitance and inductance) of each detector channel is discussed in Section 5. The measurements and analysis of the "physics" and "calibration" signal waveforms are described in Section 6, while the predictions from simulations and their comparison with observations are given is Section 7.

Some topics, such as cross-talk and signal reflections in the read-out line, are yet under study, therefore other notes on this activity are foreseen in the future.

## 2 Recalling Some Concepts

The ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter barrel (EMB) is a liquid-argon - lead sampling calorimeter, described in details in [1]. The absorbers are bent to form an "accordion" geometry and are disposed radially; the active material is liquid argon. Each gap, between two contiguous absorbers, is divided into two equal half-gaps by a read-out electrode, which is a sandwich of three copper planes separated by kapton insulator layers. The two external copper planes are used for the 2000 V high-voltage (HV) distribution, which provide the drift electric field (the absorbers provide the ground reference). Therefore, the electric signal produced by an electromagnetic shower ("physics" signal) develops between the absorber and the HV electrode layers. The inner copper layer ("signal layer") is capacitively coupled to the HV layers through the kapton, and is used to collect the "physics" signal out to the read-out chain.

The EMB covers the pseudo-rapidity range \(|\eta|<1.4\) with a full azimuth acceptance: \(0\leq\phi<2\pi\). Two types of electrodes are used: type A for \(0<|\eta|<0.8\) and type B for \(0.8<|\eta|<1.4\). Each electrode is longitudinally segmented into three samplings (front or strips, middle and back) and subdivided along \(\eta\) in "cells", pointing to the nominal interaction centre. The signals emerging from electrode cells contiguous in azimuth (\(\phi\)) are merged by the "summing boards" (SB) to form the read-out cells. The number of gaps merged for each sampling, and the granularity in \(\eta\times\phi\), are displayed in Table 1.

Each SB located behind the EMB covers 4\(\times\)4 Middle cells and 2\(\times\)4 Back cells, corresponding to an acceptance \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) = 0.1\(\times\)0.1. For each \(\phi\)row, the signal out of the summing board is arranged in the pattern M-B-M-M-B-M, where M and B denote Middle and Back cells. Each signal line has its own ground reference; the ground plane of the SB is connected to the absorbers

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c c|} \hline Sampling & N.r of gaps & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Granularity} \\  & merged & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{(\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)) w.r.t. Middle} \\ \hline Strips & 16 & 0.00375\(\times\)0.1 & 1/8 \(\times\) 4 \\ Middle & 4 & 0.025\(\times\) 0.025 & 1 \(\times\) 1 \\ Back & 4 & 0.050\(\times\) 0.025 & 2 \(\times\) 1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Granularity and number of merged gaps per read-out cell for the different samplings. \(\eta\) is pseudo-rapidity and \(\phi\) is azimuth.

through paths located on the electrodes that end with springs ("ground springs") touching the absorbers. Each SB is designed to take the ground reference from the two sides; however, on the electrodes, the "even" read-out connectors located near the HV connectors have only one ground return path to the absorber, located on the low-\(\eta\) side.

In the present note, references to middle cells will have the form Mxx, where xx runs from 0 to 54 (e.g. the first eight cells in electrodes B are named M32\(\div\)M39). Each pair of middle cells share the same back cell, therefore referencing will be based on the number of the associated even middle cell (e.g. B32 refers to the back cell shared by M32 and M33).

The SB's are grouped in \(2\times 2\) patterns by the "mother-boards" (MB), therefore each MB covers an acceptance \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\), corresponding to \(8\times 8\) Middle cells and \(4\times 8\) Back cells. From each MB the signals are carried to the preamplifiers and shapers (located on the Front-End Boards) by read-out lines, described in Table 2. The calibration lines are also connected to the MB's.

### Some results from Module-0 test beam

In years 1999 and 2000, beam tests have been carried out on the so-called Module-0 [2], a prototype of the EMB modules that will be assembled in the ATLAS experiment. Typical results from a position scan performed with 245 GeV electrons from year 2000 test beam data are visible in Figure 1: the energy response as a function of the \(\eta\) coordinate exhibits a clear pattern

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c|} \hline Line element & \(Z_{0}(\Omega)\) & length (ns) \\ \hline Connector & 40 & 0.3 \\ Pigtail + Cold Cable & 25 & 7 \(\div\) 30 \\ Cold Feedthrough & 50 & 0.2 \\ Vacuum Cable & 33 & 2.2 \\ Warm Feedthrough & 50 & 0.2 \\ Warm Cable & 33 & 2.2 \\ Base Plane & 75 & 0.3 \\ Preamplifier & 25 & — \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Breakdown of the read-out line elements from the MB to the preamplifier. The impedance of the pigtail and the cold cable is matched with that of the preamp, which is 25 \(\Omega\) for Middle and Back channels. The length of the pigtail and cold cable changes according to the distance of the MB from the feedthrough.

Figure 1: Energy response of the barrel Mo dule-0 to 245 GeV electrons, from data taken during the year 2000 test beam session. The energy is obtained from the standard 3\(\times\) 3 cluster from the Middle sampling, plus clusters of corresponding granularity from Presampler, Strips and Back sampling. All energies are corrected for the electronics calibration coefficients. The figure on the top shows the energy as a function of the impact position, for three different \(\eta\)-rows at \(\phi=9,10,11\) (Middle cells units). The bottom left figure shows the energy spread over cells \(1\div 47\) at \(\phi=10\); the bottom right figure shows the relative energy spread in \(\phi\), after removing the oscillations along \(\eta\).

with a periodicity of 8 Middle cells, over which the peak-to-peak variation is 10 GeV (4%); the RMS over the full \(\eta\) range is 5 GeV (2%).

The general idea is that the cause of disuniformity is to be sought in the electrical properties of the detector itself and of the readout chain down to the preamplifiers. In more details, the following points are thought to be relevant:

* The calibration signal is injected on the motherboards, while the signal induced by electromagnetic cascades originates inside the detector: this introduces differences in shape and amplitude between the two signals, as it will be explained in the next section.
* The readout line, made of several cables with different characteristic impedances, generates reflections in the outgoing signal, causing further distorsions. Since the calibration signal and the physics signal differ, these distorsions are also different.
* The asymmetry in the ground springs mentioned above, that causes the "odd" summing boards along one \(\eta\) line to have only one ground reference connected to the electrodes, instead of two. This is believed to explain (at least partially) the 8-fold periodicity along \(\eta\) of the energy response.

## 3 Electrical Models

### Basic detector electrical model

The simplest model for a detector cell is drawn in Figure 2. The liquid argon (LAr) gap can be described as a capacitor \(C\) between the absorber (ground reference) and the readout electrode.

The signal originated by an e.m. shower ("physics" signal) is represented by a triangular current generator applied between the two capacitor plates, which in the Laplace domain reads:

\[I_{\rm inj}^{\rm phys}=I_{0}^{\rm phys}\left\{\frac{1}{s}-\frac{1-e^{-st_{\rm D }}}{s^{2}t_{\rm D}}\right\} \tag{1}\]

(here \(I_{0}^{\rm phys}\) is the absolute signal amplitude at the injection point, which is proportional to the energy released in the cell by the shower, and \(t_{\rm D}\) is the drift time in the 2mm gap, \(\simeq 400\) ns). The signal is brought to the summing board (SB) and the mother board (MB) through a path on the electrode, which is inductive; \(L\) is the total inductance of such path plus the SB and MB contribution. The calibration pulse is an exponential current generator injected on the MB with a decay time \(t_{\rm cali}\simeq 400\,\)ns, whose Laplace transform is:

\[I_{\rm inj}^{\rm cali}=I_{0}^{\rm cali}\frac{t_{\rm cali}}{1+st_{\rm cali}} \tag{2}\]

The readout line consists of a set of lines connected to each other and closed on a preamplifier with input impedance \(R_{\rm pre}=25\;\Omega\). The line can be described by a transfer matrix \(M\) such that:

\[\left(\begin{array}{c}V_{\rm line,in}\\ I_{\rm line,in}\end{array}\right) = M\left(\begin{array}{c}V_{\rm line,out}\\ I_{\rm line,out}\end{array}\right) \tag{3}\] \[= \left(\begin{array}{cc}M_{VV}&M_{VI}\\ M_{IV}&M_{II}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}V_{\rm line,out}\\ I_{\rm line,out}\end{array}\right)\]

Since \(V_{\rm line,out}=R_{\rm pre}I_{\rm line,out}\), the line presents at its input an impedance:

\[Z_{\rm line,in}=\frac{M_{VV}R_{\rm pre}+M_{VI}}{M_{I}VR_{\rm pre}+M_{II}} \tag{4}\]

and the voltage at the line output (i.e. at the preamplifier input) is:

\[V_{\rm line,out}=V_{\rm pre,in} = \frac{R_{\rm pre}}{M_{I\,V}R_{\rm pre}+M_{II}}I_{\rm line,in} \tag{5}\] \[= H_{\rm line}I_{\rm line,in}\]

Figure 2: Simple schematics of a LAr cell with its readout chain and calibration network.

The preamplifier provides a gain \(\alpha\) (assumed to be constant over the relevant frequency range) and the shaper is of the type CR-RC\({}^{2}\), therefore the overall transfer function of the two components is:

\[H_{\rm sh}=\frac{V_{\rm out}}{V_{\rm pre,in}}=\alpha\frac{s\tau}{(1+s\tau)^{3}} \tag{6}\]

where \(\tau=15\) ns is the shaper characteristic time (\(2\tau\) is the peaking time of the shaper response to a step-function input).

Due to the inductive path connecting the LAr gap to the readout line, the calibration signal sees a circuit different than the physics signal. In fact, the calibration current entering the line is given by:

\[I^{\rm cali}_{\rm line,in}=I^{\rm cali}_{\rm inj}\frac{Z_{\rm det}+Z_{\rm conn }}{Z_{\rm det}+Z_{\rm conn}+Z_{\rm line,in}} \tag{7}\]

while the physics current entering the line is:

\[I^{\rm phys}_{\rm line,in}=I^{\rm phys}_{\rm inj}\frac{Z_{\rm det}}{Z_{\rm det }+Z_{\rm conn}+Z_{\rm line,in}} \tag{8}\]

where \(Z_{\rm det}\) and \(Z_{\rm conn}\) are the impedances offered by the detector gap and by its connection to the readout line, respectively. In this simple model, the detector and "connection" impedances are:

\[Z_{\rm det} = \frac{1}{sC} \tag{9}\] \[Z_{\rm conn} = sL \tag{10}\]

The complete formulae for the output voltage due to physics and calibration signals are as follows:

\[V^{\rm phys}_{\rm out} = H_{\rm sh}\,H_{\rm line}I^{\rm phys}_{\rm inj}\frac{Z_{\rm det} }{Z_{\rm det}+Z_{\rm conn}+Z_{\rm line,in}} \tag{11}\] \[V^{\rm cali}_{\rm out} = H_{\rm sh}\,H_{\rm line}I^{\rm cali}_{\rm inj}\frac{Z_{\rm det} +Z_{\rm conn}}{Z_{\rm det}+Z_{\rm conn}+Z_{\rm line,in}} \tag{12}\]

The ratio between physics and calibration signal at the shaper output is then:

\[\frac{V^{\rm phys}_{\rm out}}{V^{\rm cali}_{\rm out}}=\frac{I^{\rm phys}_{ \rm inj}}{I^{\rm cali}_{\rm inj}}\frac{Z_{\rm det}}{Z_{\rm det}+Z_{\rm conn}} \tag{13}\]

which, in the simple detector model described by equations (9), (10), reads:

\[\frac{V^{\rm phys}_{\rm out}}{V^{\rm cali}_{\rm out}}=\frac{I^{\rm phys}_{ \rm inj}}{I^{\rm cali}_{\rm inj}}\frac{1}{1+s^{2}LC} \tag{14}\]The meaning of this result is that the two signals differ for two reasons: one is the different injected shape (triangular and exponential, respectively), the other is that the two are injected at different locations. All the effects due to the readout line, the preamplifier and the shaper (described by the parameters \(Z_{\mathrm{line,in}},H_{\mathrm{sh}},H_{\mathrm{line}}\)) are common to both signals and cancel out when taking the ratio.

### A more detailed model for an electrode channel

The detector model described in Figure 2 is very simplified. In the reality, things differ for the following reasons:

* each detector cell consists of more electrode channels connected together by the summing board (16 for the strips, 4 for middle and back samplings);
* on each electrode, channels belonging to strips, middle and back samplings are not electrically independent, being connected by resistors on the high-voltage (HV) layers; more precisely, each middle channel has 8 strips associated and shares a back channel with another neighbouring middle channel;
* the high-voltage layer of each middle or back cell is subdivided in pads, while the signal layer is continuous; the signal and the HV layers of each electrode channel are capacitively-coupled through the kapton layer, the overall capacitance through kapton being \(\approx 80\) times larger than that through the LAr gap.
* cross-capacitances and, possibly, mutual inductances exist between neighbouring channels.

Figure 3 shows a more realistic electrical scheme of one middle channel in one electrode. The complete scheme, accounting for "all" high voltage pads, is drawn in (a), while (b) represents a reasonable simplification, in which the 8 strips are lumped together (with effective resistance and capacitance equal to the parallels of the 8 strips resistances and capacitances) and the middle and back HV layers are considered as continuous. The reason of the last assumption is that two consecutive pads are coupled through the signal layer and the two kapton capacitances, that offer an impedance much smaller than the resistor in the frequency region of interest (\(\gtrsim 100\) kHz).

As it will be shown in Section 5, the model proposed here is necessary to understand some results from the impedance measurements, while the simpler LC model is not adequate. In Section 7, the effect of adding the strips and back will be shown on the physics and calibration signals.

## 4 Description of the System Layout

The detector model ("mock-up") realized in Milano consists of 4 B-electrodes 1 and 5 absorbers piled-up and interspaced by holed polypropylene (PP) strips in the plane portions to simulate the LAr gaps (see Figure 24). The PP thickness is (2.0\(\pm\)0.1) mm, and its plastic/air ratio was chosen in order to reproduce an average dielectric constant \(\epsilon_{r}\simeq 1.5\),2 similar to that of liquid argon at 80 K temperature.

Footnote 1: The electrodes used were discarded because not satisfying the requirements for being used in an ECAL module, therefore their quality is poor, especially for what concerns the HV resistors values; broken resistors were repaired with silver epoxy or resistive ink, there are no broken paths on the signal layer, and the measured kapton capacitances are regular.

Footnote 2: The value of \(\epsilon_{r}\) has been tested to be stable to better than 0.5% over a wide frequency range: 100 kHz \(\div\) 100 MHz.

Inside the 2nd gap 3 twelve middle cells (M32\(\div\)M43, corresponding to three SB's) have been equipped with "physics injectors", described below, to simulate the electromagnetic shower that develops in the LAr gaps. The coaxial cables carrying the signal from the pulse generator to the injectors run along the electrode folds, that are free of PP.

Footnote 3: Gaps are numbered 1 through 4 starting from that on the top.

The mock-up is laid on plastic supports and pushed by a pressing system that provides a better mechanics stability (it has been observed that modest pressure variations cause sizable fluctuations in the gap width, and therefore in the capacitances).

Three SB's are available to be plugged on the electrodes back connectors to merge together channels from the 4 different gaps. \(L,C\) measurements can be performed both on separate gaps and on the SB's. The electrodes in use are yet of the type with asymmetric ground returns on some back connectors: connectors 1 and 3 (middle cells 32\(\div\)35 and 40\(\div\)43 respectively) have two ground springs, while connectors 2 and 4 (cells 36\(\div\)39 and 44\(\div\)47) have only one on the small-\(\eta\) side. However, connector 2 has been equipped with removable extra-ground springs on the large-\(\eta\) side, in order to study the effects of this asymmetry.

A faraday cage has been built to screen the system from external electromagnetic noise.

For the time being, signal waveforms are read out directly from the SB's, i.e. no attempts have been done so far to complete the read-out chain as in the detector (MB + cold cable + vacuum cable + warm cable).

### Injection circuits

For both "physics" and calibration injections, exponential pulses are used, by sending a fast step-function through an R-C circuit, as shown in Figure 4. In order to allow multiple physics injection on neighbouring cells (thus simulating a cluster), 12 physics injectors are located between the electrode and the absorber (see Figure 24 and the detail in Figure 25). The calibration injector is unique and can be plugged in any channel through the SB.

All injectors are made with 4 k \(\Omega\) resistors and 100 pF capacitors that have been selected from a larger set with an accuracy of \(\sim\) 0.1%. Each injector has been tested closed on a 350 pF capacitor and read on the oscilloscope through a 50 \(\Omega\) cable: the traces on the scope confirm the uniformity at the \(\sim\) 0.1% level.

### Electronic instrumentation and measurement methods

An HP-4395A network/impedance/spectrum analyser is used to perform impedance measurements in the frequency domain. Normally each measurement consists of 401 samples, equally spaced in log-scale, over the frequency interval 10 kHz \(\div\) 100 MHz, with a 100 Hz IF bandwidth. During such measurements, the channel under exam is read through a 50 \(\Omega\) LEMO cable, while all the other channels are left open, to ensure that no current

Figure 4: Electric scheme of a “physics” injector. A step-function voltage signal is sent through a 50 \(\Omega\) coaxial cable terminated at 50 \(\Omega\), and followed by an R-C series circuit producing an exponential signal with a decay constant of 400 ns, which is injected between the absorber and the electrode HV layer. The calibration signal is produced in the same way, but is injected at the summing board level.

flows into them through parasitic couplings. Measurements are performed both on single gaps (i.e. on single electrodes) and on the SB.

Step-function pulses are generated by a LeCroy 9210 dual channel pulse generator with a 1 ns rise time and a maximum voltage of 5 V. The output signal from the SB is fed into a programmable CR-RC\({}^{2}\) shaper; to avoid saturation at this level, it is necessary to operate the pulse generator at 3 V maximum. When performing multiple physics injection, the two channels are used at the same time: one for the central cell, the other, by means of a power splitter, for the two neighbouring cells. In such a way, it is possible to synchronize the three injections and vary the signal amplitudes independently for the central cell and the two side cells.

The signal waveforms are acquired on a Tektronix TDS 754D 8 bits, 2GSample/s, 500 MHz bandwidth digital oscilloscope, and averaged over 400 samples. The precision from digitization, achieved with this procedure, has been estimated from the smallest appreciable output difference, and amounts to \(\sim 0.2\) mV for a signal amplitude of 1 V. During signal injection and measurements, the SB is always used, and all channels are terminated on 25 \(\Omega\) loads (obtained using either 25 \(\Omega\) resistors or 50 \(\Omega\) LEMO cables in parallel with 50 \(\Omega\) resistors). This is done to reproduce more faithfully what happens in the real detector (i.e. cross-talk due to parasitic couplings to the neighboring channels).

## 5 \(C\), \(L\) measurements

A precise measurement of the \(L,C\) parameters for each channel is crucial for having a good understanding of the system behaviour. In this section, a critical discussion of such measurement is proposed, and results are shown.

### Extraction of \(C\), \(L\) from impedance measurements

The expected signal-to-ground impedance for a middle sampling channel, neglecting the presence of strips and back sampling (see the simplified model in Figure 5), is:

\[Z_{\rm naive}=r+j\omega L+\frac{1}{j\omega C}\frac{R_{\rm HV}}{R_{\rm HV}+1/j \omega C} \tag{15}\]

where \(r\) is a contact resistor (\(\ \raise 1.29pt\hbox{$<$\kern-7.5pt\raise-4.73pt\hbox{$\sim$}}\ 1\ \Omega\)), and \(R_{\rm HV}\) is the HV distribution resistor (\(\approx 1\ \rm M\Omega\)), whose effect is sizable only at low frequencies (\(\ \raise 1.29pt\hbox{$<$\kern-7.5pt\raise-4.73pt\hbox{$\sim$}}\ 10\ \rm kHz\)). In t this situation one can define the _effective series capacitance_\(C_{s}\) such that:

\[X\,=\mbox{Im}(Z)\,=-\frac{1}{\omega\,C_{s}} \tag{16}\]

This is equivalent to assume that the circuit is a simple R-C series, which is reasonable for frequencies well below the L-C resonance, but high enough to neglect the effect of \(R_{\rm HV}\). When approaching the resonance frequency, the value of \(C_{s}\) is related to \(C\), \(L\) by the following:

\[C_{s}\,=\frac{C}{1-(\omega/\omega_{0})^{2}}\hskip 28.452756pt;\hskip 28.452756pt \omega_{0}\,=\frac{1}{\sqrt{LC}} \tag{17}\]

therefore, by measuring \(C_{s}\) vs frequency, one can find the resonance \(\omega_{0}\) (vertical asymptot), then take a \(C_{s}\) value at a given \(\omega\) and work out \(C\) from equation (17). The advantage of this method is that the measurement is independent of \(\mbox{Re}(Z)\), hence of the contact resistor \(r\).

In practice, the model assumed in Figure 5 is not adequate to describe in detail the detector, as it does not account for the paths parallel to the middle gap capacitance, introduced by the strips and back sampling (see Figure 3). This is evident when performing a \(C_{s}\) measurement on any middle channel, as that shown in Figure 6, with SB (top) and for separate gaps (bottom). In the intermediate frequency range (20 kHz\(\div\)2 MHz) a regular slope can be observed, where a plateau was expected from equation (17). However,

Figure 5: Simple schematics of a LAr cell with its readout chain and calibration network.

Figure 6: Typical measurements of \(C_{s}\) and \(|Z|\) as functions of frequency for: _(top) 4_ gaps connected by the SB, and _(bottom)_ single gaps nn. 1, 2, 3. The horizontal scale is logarithmic between 1 kHz and 100 MHz. In the bottom plot, the gap with anomalous trend (the “kn ee” at \(\approx\) 15 kHz) is n. 2, where the physics injection is applied.

introducing strips and back in the model describes correctly this slope, as shown in Figure 7. This proves that the presence of strips and back is not negligible.4

Footnote 4: The effects of strips, back and injector on the physics and calibration signals will be discussed in Section 7.

In Figure 6(bottom) differences among gaps belonging to the same \(\eta\) are evident. First, two gaps (number 1 and 3) exibit similar trends, but n. 3 is systematically higher than n. 1: this is due to gravity, because lower gaps are subject to larger pressure and are therefore more squeezed. Moreover, gap n. 2 (the one where physics injection is applied) shows a clearly different trend: this is due to the injection R-C circuit put in parallel to the gap capacitance, as is evident from simulation in Figure 8.

It must be noted that all these effects are well evident in a \(C_{s}\)-vs-freq plot, but not quite in the corresponding \(|Z|\)-vs-freq plot.

As shown in Figures 7 and 8, the effect of strips, back and injector does not affect the value of \(\mathrm{Im}(Z)\) near the resonance, where it can be described as:

\[X_{\mathrm{res}}=\omega L-\frac{1}{\omega C} \tag{18}\]

Therefore, \(L\) and \(C\) are extracted by fitting the function (18) to the data in a frequency range between \(\pm 1.5\%\) around the zero crossing.5 The frequency interval for the fit has been chosen in order to keep the result stable. Typical precision, estimated by repeating the frequency scan few times over the same cells and refitting, are \(\delta C\approx 15\) pF and \(\delta L\approx 5\) n H.

Footnote 5: \(X_{\mathrm{res}}\) is null for \(\omega=\omega_{0}=1/\sqrt{LC}\), and the slope is \((\mathrm{d}X_{\mathrm{res}}/\mathrm{d}\omega)_{\omega=\omega_{0}}=2L\), therefore the curve of \(X\) around the resonance contains sufficient information to extract \(L\) and \(C\).

### Results from \(C,\ L\) measurements

Capacitance and inductance measurements have been carried out over the first 16 middle channels and 8 back channel of the mock-up, corresponding to the region \(0.8\leq\eta\leq 1.2\), or to middle cells 32\(\div\)47. For each channel, measurements have been performed both on single gaps and on the SB.

Connectors 1 and 3 (middle cells 32\(\div\)35 and 40\(\div\)43 respectively) are equipped with two ground springs each, while connector 4 (middle cells 44\(\div\)47) has only one ground spring on the low-\(\eta\) side. Connector 2 (middle cells 36\(\div\)39) was originally equipped with one ground spring, but a second removable one has been added, and \(C,L\) measurements have been performed both with one and two ground springs.

The \(C,L\) scan along \(\eta\) for single gaps, with two ground springs on connector 2, is displayed in Figures 9 and 10 for middle and back samplings,Figure 7: Simulation of the strips and back effect on \(C_{s}\) and \(X=\mathrm{Im}(Z)\) for: (top) 4 gaps connected by the SB, and (bottom) a single gap. The four curves describe the predicted trend for middle only (solid), middle+strips (dashed), middle+back (dotted) and middle+strips+back (dash-dotted). In the simulation, typical values for the detector parameters are used.

Figure 8: Simulation of the physics injector effect on \(C_{s}\) and \(X\,=\,\)Im\((Z)\) for: (top) 4 gaps connected by the SB, and (bottom) a single gap. The solid line is the trend without injector; the dashed line is the distortion due to the presence of the 4 k\(\Omega\) - 100 pF physics injector (i.e. the one in use); the dotted line shows that decreasing \(R\) while keeping \(RC\) constant, increases the distortion.

respectively.

The \(L\) measurements show a very good agreement, within few n H, among the different gaps, which is expected since the inductive paths are located on the electrodes, and therefore must be equal to each other. In the middle sampling, a "high-low-low-high" pattern with periodicity 4 cells is clearly visible: this is due to the electrode geometry.

The \(C\) measurements show similar trends for gaps nn. 1, 3, 4: the absolute difference is explained by the dielectric compression due to absorbers weight, which causes lower gaps to exhibit larger capacitances. The anomalous trend on gap n. 2 in the middle sampling is due to the presence of the coaxial cables connected to physics injectors: all cables enter the mock-up from the large-\(\eta\) edge, and each ends on a different cell, therefore there is more material in the gap at large \(\eta\) than at low \(\eta\). This phenomenon has been understood quantitatively, and it is also a validation of the precision achieved in the measurement.

The \(C,L\) scan along \(\eta\) with the SB (i.e. summing together the four gaps) is displayed in Figures 11 and 12 for middle and back samplings, respectively. Here, measurements are performed both with one and two ground springs on connector 2: the effect can be observed on cells 36\(\div\)39. When removing the ground spring on the large-\(\eta\) side, the measured inductances increase, especially near the side where the ground is removed, while the \(C\) values are essentially unchanged. The increase in the measured inductance indicates that the ground return path from the SB output to the absorber is also inductive, and more precisely the inductance is located partly on the SB "ground" plane and partly on the electrode. This feature is discussed in more detail in Section 7.

By comparing the measured \(L\) values with and without SB (see Figure 13) information can be extracted on the inductive signal path on the SB. Naively (i.e. neglecting the capacitances!) one would expect:

\[\frac{1}{L_{\text{\tiny{tgaps}}}}=\sum_{\text{\tiny{gap=1}}}^{4}\frac{1}{L_{ \text{\tiny{gap}}}}\]

while the data show an offset between the two quantities, which could be taken as an estimate of the SB inductance (\(\approx 12\) nH).6Figure 11: Measurements of the L,C values for middle cells with SB, in the region \(\eta=0.8\div 1.2\), corresponding to middle cells 32\(\div\)47. Connector 4 has one ground spring. For connector 2 the measurement has been performed both with two and one ground spring (squares and stars, respectively).

Signal Measurements

In the ATLAS LAr electromagnetic calorimeter, "physics" signals (originated by electromagnetic cascades) are like triangular current pulses closed on the detector capacitance \(C\) and read-out through a chain with input impedance \(Z_{\mbox{\tiny ro}}\); therefore, the current seen is scaled by a factor \(1/(1+sC\,Z_{\mbox{\tiny ro}})\) (in the Laplace domain). This factor is not uniform over the calorimeter, since the \(C\) value varies along \(\eta\). For this reason, the calorimeter has been designed to be electronically calibrated cell by cell, by sending a known current pulse in each channel and reading the output signal. Then, the physics signals must be scaled by a factor inversely proportional to the corresponding calibration signal amplitude.

This method works only in principle, since the physics and calibration pulses are injected on different places in the detector, as already explained in Section 2. Therefore, the calibration procedure must be further refined.

The mock-up provides a good tool to study these features. In particular, the dependance of physics and calibration signals on the detector capacitance and inductance have been studied, as well as the effect of having one or two ground springs on a SB connector.

### Single physics injection

Physics and calibration signals have been injected on middle cells 32\(\div\)39, corresponding to the region \(0.8\leq\eta\leq 1.0\). The pulse generator has been

Figure 15: Typical waveforms shaped at \(\tau=15\) ns, for a physics (left) and a calibration (right) signal, acquired on the same cell (middle 39 with two ground springs).

operated to generate a 3 V step-function, and the waveforms have been acquired on the Tektronix oscilloscope and then analysed offline to find the peak amplitude and timing. For middle cells 36\(\div\)39 the acquisition has been performed both with two and one ground spring.

Typical examples of physics and calibration waveforms are displayed in Figure 15. The calibration waveform (on the right) differs from the physics waveform (on the left) especially for the "shoulder" on the rise. This effect, which is also predicted by simulations, is due to the cell inductance, which is seen in series with the read-out by the physics signal, but in parallel by the calibration. The effect is even more evident when the shaping time is decreased from 15 ns to 5 ns, in which case the "shoulder" becomes a sharp peak.

Figure 16: Correlations among signal amplitudes and \(C,\ L\) cell parameters. Measurements are displayed both for two ground springs (solid circles) and one ground spring (open squares).

Figure 17: Physics and calibration signal measured as a function of \(\eta\). The plots on the left show the peaks of the output shaped signals for “physics”and “calibration” injection in cells 32\(\div\)39 from middle sampling, and the ratio between the two. Solid circles (open squares) refer to measurements performed with two (one) ground springs per connector. The corresponding plots on the right show the relative deviation between the two ground configurations.

In Figure 16 some correlations between signal amplitudes and \(C\), \(L\) cell parameters can be observed. Figures (a) and (b) show that an increase in \(C\) determines a decrease in both the physics and calibration peaks; here the correlation is not so evident, because the signal amplitude is influenced also by other parameters, such as \(L\). In figure (c) the correlation between physics and calibration amplitudes is evident, which legitimates the procedure of correcting the physics signal by the inverse of the calibration. However, even after this correction, the cells equalization is not complete, as a dependence on the inductance \(L\) is still manifest, as in figure (d). Here, it is also evident that the removal of one ground spring increases the effective inductance and at the same time increases the physics-to-calibration ratio.

The \(\eta\)-scan for physics and calibration measurements is displayed in Figure 17. Physics and calibration oscillate with a peak-to-peak variation of \(\sim 3\%\), following similar patterns. The effect of the 2nd ground spring removal is most evident on middle cell 39, where the inductance variation is most sizable; the signal distorsion is \(+0.6\%\) for the physics, \(-0.8\%\) for the calibration, and \(+1.4\%\) for the physics-to-calibration ratio. The removal of the 2nd ground spring affects also the response uniformity over the examined 8 middle cells: the r.m.s. disuniformity in the physics-to-calibration ratio increases from \(0.3\%\) to \(0.6\%\), while the peak-to-peak deviation increases from \(\sim 1\%\) to \(\sim 2\%\).

### Multiple physics injection

To simulate the effect of grouping neighbouring cells into a "cluster", as it happens in the real detector offline analysis, a multiple "physics" injection has been performed on groups of three contiguous cells. The central cell and the two side cells of each group are injected with 2.4 V and 0.3 V step-function, respectively, in order to mimic a 10%-80%-10% energy sharing7

Footnote 7: In test beam data analysis, clusters are obtained grouping 3\(\times\)3 middle cells (“nonet”). By requiring that the energy centroid be well centred with respect to the central cell, the energy sharing for a 300 GeV electron is about (in percentage):

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
0.75 & 7 & 0.75 \\ \hline
7 & 69 & 7 \\ \hline
0.75 & 7 & 0.75 \\ \end{tabular} therefore, projecting onto the \(\eta\) axis, one gets 8.5%-83%-8.5%, similar to the sharing used here.

Figure 18: Signal amplitudes, measured as a function of \(\eta\), for calibrated cluster obtained by injecting 80% of the signal in the central cell and 10% in each of the side cells. In the top figure, solid circles (open squares) refer to measurements performed with two (one) ground springs per connector. The bottom figure displays the relative variation between the two configurations.

The calibration signals have been injected on single cells8

Footnote 8: This is slightly different from what happens in the real calorimeter, where more than one cell are pulsed at the same time, according to the pattern:

\[E_{k}^{\rm clus}=\sum_{m=k\,-1}^{k+1}\frac{E_{m}^{\rm phys}}{E_{m}^{\rm cali}} \tag{19}\]

where \(E_{m}^{\rm phys}\) and \(E_{m}^{\rm cali}\) are the signal amplitudes measured on cell \(m\) for physics and calibration respectively.

The results are shown in Figure 18. Clusters around cells M32 and M41 are about 10% lower than the others, because one of the side cells is missing (cell M31 and M42 respectively). Clusters around cells M33\(\div\)M38 exhibit a spread of 0.3% (0.45%) when two grounds are (one ground is) connected. Removing the 2nd ground from the 2nd connector, the maximal deviation is observable in the cluster around cell M39, amounting to 1.1%.

## 7 Signal Simulations

The response of the mock-up detector both to a "physics" and to a "calibration" pulse has been simulated using a SPICE [3] equivalent circuit model, performing a transient analysis while injecting the cells in the appropriate place of the network.

The first goal of the simulation is to to test the accuracy of the model used to describe the detector. It has been possible at the same time to investigate the dependence of the response to the pulses on the values of the lumped elements of the network.

### Detector description

Starting from the "reasonably simplified" equivalent circuit of one detector cell shown in Figure 3, it is possible to build a more complex model of the six cells that share the same SB (four cells in the middle and two in the back sampling), taking into account the effect on the distribution of the ground voltage reference on SB itself and the capacitive coupling between neighbouring cells. The complete equivalent circuit model of the six cells is shown in Figure 19.

The full complexity of the circuit is anyway not necessary to accurately simulate the electrical behaviour of the mock-up cells. The equivalent circuit used in the SPICE simulation is somehow simpler, mainly because of the following two assumptions:

* A cell, composed by four LAr gaps joined together by a SB, is well represented in the useful frequency range by an effective single capacitance and an effective single inductance connected in serie. It is reasonable to neglect the effect of the kapton capacitances, since in the SPICE circuit the effective \(C\) and \(L\) values, measured as described in Section 5, are used. Mutual inductances between neighbouring channels are also neglected.

Figure 19: Equivalent circuit describing six cells (four from middle and two from back sampling) sharing the same SB. The inductive ground return path and the cross capacitances between neighbour cells are shown.

* The effect of the resistive coupling between the cells of the middle and the strips (drawn as R-C branches in parallel to the middle gap capacitances in Figure 19) causes an attenuation of \(-0.3\%\) on the signal peak. This distortion is quantitatively the same (within 0.02%) for physics and calibration signal, and it does not depend on the cell parameters (\(L\), \(C\), etc.), therefore it does not affect the uniformity, and cancels out when evaluating the physics-to-calibration ratio. The presence of physics injectors in gap n. 2 affects the calibration signal by a \(-0.3\%\), again uniformly over the different cells. For this reason, the strips and the physics injectors have not been included in the simulation. Similar arguments prove that the HV bias resistances can be neglected in the simulation.

Other basic characteristics of the model used in the simulation are the following:

* The six read-out lines take the ground reference from the same shared SB. This "ground return" path is naively modelled by an inductive chain, exactly as shown in Figure 19. The inductace between two neighbouring channels is supposed to be small and equal (\(L_{x}\)) for each pair of neighbouring cells. The ground plane on the SB is connected to the ground reference on the absorber planes by two inductive paths (\(L_{G}\)) going to the ground springs (see Section 7.2 for details on \(L_{x}\) and \(L_{G}\) calculation). The effect of the absence of the of the second ground connection in cells 36\(\div\)39 is simulated by removing one of the two \(L_{G}\) in the large-\(\eta\) side.
* The capacitive coupling between neighbouring cells has been described connecting the channels with cross capacitances (\(C_{x}\)). The direct measurement of the \(C_{x}\) values on the mock-up is difficult and really unprecise. In the simulation we used one single value for the \(C_{x}\) between every two adjacent middle cells (\(C_{x}^{mm}\) = 80 pF), and one for the \(C_{x}\) between every middle cells and its neighbouring back (\(C_{x}^{mb}\) = 5 pF). These values have been estimated from the low-voltage test measurements on the electrodes.
* For every cell the readout chain is represented by a 25 \(\Omega\) resistance, that simulates the behaviour of a perfectly terminated line followed by a perfect preamplifier with infinite flat bandwidth. After this termination resistance an equivalent circuit for a CR-RC\({}^{2}\) shaper is connected. This is modeled as a chain of CR or RC stages, each powered by a voltage source driven by the output voltage of the previous stage.

The simulation has been performed on a global equivalent circuit describing 12 cells of the middle sampling (32\(\div\)43) and the corresponding 6 cells of the back sampling. \(C\) and \(L\) values are taken from measurements described in Section 5.

The circuit corresponds to 3 SB. Cross-capacitances between neighbouring cells of the middle sampling sharing different SB have been put.

### Inductive ground return estimate

Effective values of the capacitances and the inductance have been measured for all the cells of the middle and back sampling of the mock-up.

For the cells belonging to the second SB (middle cells from 36 to 39) the measurements has been performed both with and without the second ground connection, finding compatible values for the effective capacitance, and, as expected, different values for the effective inductance. These pairs of different \(L\) values are used to estimate the components \(L_{x}\) and \(L_{G}\) of the inductive ground return path.

Calling \(L_{k}\) the specific inductance, located on the electrode, of the \(k\)-th cell out of the \(n\) sharing the same SB, according to the model shown in Figure 19 the \(k\)-th channel sees an effective total inductance amounting to:

\[L_{k}^{\rm 2gnd} = L_{k}+(L_{G}+(k-1)L_{x})\parallel(L_{G}+(n-k)L_{x}) \tag{20}\] \[= L_{k}+\frac{L_{G}^{2}+(n-1)L_{G}L_{x}+(n-k)(k-1)L_{x}^{2}}{2L_{G }+(n-1)L_{x}}\]

in the case where both of the ground springs are connected, or

\[L_{k}^{\rm 1gnd}=L_{k}+L_{G}+(k-1)L_{x} \tag{21}\]

in the case where only one is connected. In this evaluation, possible effects due to mutual inductances have been neglected. The difference between these two values is

\[\Delta L_{k}=\frac{\left(L_{G}+(k-1)L_{x}\right)^{2}}{2L_{G}+(n-1)L_{x}} \tag{22}\]

from which it is possible to calculate the values of \(L_{x}\) and \(L_{G}\), since

\[\Delta L_{n}-\Delta L_{1}=(n-1)L_{x} \tag{23}\] \[L_{G}^{2}=\Delta L_{1}\left(2L_{G}+(n-1)L_{x}\right) \tag{24}\]The values of the effective inductance measured on the mock-up for cells 36\(\div\)39 of the middle sampling and 36 and 38 of the back sampling are shown in Figure 20, versus their relative position on the SB itself (M36, B36, M37, M38, B38, M39). An increasing trend is clearly visible when removing the second ground connection.

The estimate of \(L_{x}\) and \(L_{G}\) has been done using the global variation of \(L\) between the two edge channels on the SB (\(k=1\), middle cell 36; \(k=6\), middle cell 39): \((\Delta L_{6}-\Delta L_{1})=5L_{x}\simeq 8.7\) nH from which we obtain the values

\[L_{x} \simeq 1.7\] nH \[L_{G} \simeq 3\] nH

that have been used in the SPICE equivalent circuit.

### Results and comparison with measurements

Results of the simulation are shown in Figure 21. The first two plots on the left show the peaks of the output shaped signals for "physics" and "calibration" injection in cells 32\(\div\)39 from middle sampling. The two series of data in each plot refer to the values obtained using one or two ground connections in the second connector. The third plot on the left shows the ratio between the "physics" and "calibration" output signal peaks, again both for the one-ground and two-grounds configurations. The corresponding plots on the right show the relative deviation between the two ground configurations.

The trend of the "physics" and "calibration" output signals peaks is mainly driven by both the cell capacitances and the cross-capacitances values. The effect of the capacitance values is the same for both "physics" and "calibration" signals, and cancels out when calculating the ratio.

The output of cell 32 is significantly higher then the others, both in "physics" and in "calibration". This is due to the absence of a capacitive coupling to a neighbouring cell on the small-\(\eta\) side: this is in agreement with what observed in the data collected on the mock-up.

The simulation predicts an increase of the "physics" signals, due to the absence of the second ground connection, that is roughly linearly dependent on the position of the cell in the SB. The maximum value of the relative increase is \(+0.4\%\) for cell 39, which is farthest from the ground spring. A similar behaviour is predicted for "calibration" output signals, that shows a linear decrease whose maximum value is \(-1.2\%\) for cell 39. The overall effects of the absence of the second ground connection on the ratio between Figure 20: Effective \(L\) values of mo ck-up cells 36-39 of the middle sampling and 36 and 38 of the back sampling, versus their relative position on the SB itself (M36, B36, M37, M38, B38, M39). On top the values measured with and without the second ground connection, on bottom the difference between the two series.

Figure 21: Results of simulation using the detector SPICE model. The plots on the left show the peaks of the output shaped signals for “physics”and “calibration” injection in cells 32\(\div\)39 from middle sampling, and the ratio between the two. The two series in each plot refer to two-grounds (solid circles) and one-ground (open squares) configurations on the second connector. The corresponding plots on the right show the relative deviation between the two ground configurations.

"physics" and "calibration" signal is +1.6% for cell 39. This result is in fair agreement with what observed on the mock-up (see Section 6).

This leads to conclude that the set-up used to simulate the detector is correct, both in the equivalent circuit model and in the parameters values used.

Simulations similar to the one described above have been performed using different values of the equivalent circuit parameters. As mentioned before, the results are not sensitive to cell capacitances or cross capacitances values, at least in the ratio between "physics" and "calibration" output signals.

On the other hand, this ratio is very sensitive to the inductance values, especially to the ground return path component \(L_{x}\), as can be noticed from Figure 22. The plots report the percentage variation on the output signal

Figure 22: Percentage variation on the output signal peaks (“physics”, “calibration”, ratio between the two) on cell 39 from middle sampling, between the configuration with one and two ground connections.

peaks on cell 39 from middle sampling, between the configuration with one and two ground connections. It is evident that the effect increases linearly with the \(L_{x}\) value: it can be easily calculated a dependence of \(\sim\)0.9% /nH9

Footnote 9: This refers to a variation on the value of each \(L_{x}\) out of the five in the inductive ground chain. In every simulation the value of the two \(L_{G}\) is left equal to 3 nH each.

### Multiple physics injection

Similarly to what has been done for the signal measurements, a simulation has been carried out to study the performances of clusters. Three cells are

The bottom figure displays the relative variation between the two configurations.

injected at the same time, with 80% of the overall energy in the central cell and 10% in each side cell. The cell around which the cluster is built runs from M32 to M43

The results are shown in Figure 23. Clusters around cells M32 and M43 are about 10% lower than the others, because one of the side cells is missing (cell M31 and M44 respectively). Clusters around cells M33\(\div\)M38 exhibit a spread of 0.3% (0.7%) when two grounds are (one ground is) connected. Removing the 2nd ground from the 2nd connector, the maximal deviation is observable in the cluster around cell M39, amounting to 1.5%.

## 8 Summary and Conclusions

The mock-up built in Milano proved to be a good apparatus to test in detail the electrical properties of the liquid-Argon electromagnetic calorimeter. For the time being, it has been possible to better understand the electrical behaviour of the electrodes, and create a model with lumped elements that reasonably describes the observations. Signal waveforms are understood, both for "physics" and calibration signals.

The system exhibits an intrinsic disuniformity over the first eight middle cells of electrode B (corresponding to \(0.8<\eta<1.0\)) of about 0.3%. This value is worsened when removing one ground spring from the 2nd electrode-to-SB connector, becoming 0.6% for single injection and 0.45% for cluster-like injection. The effect of this distortion is most evident on middle cell 39 (\(0.975<\eta<1\)), where the ground spring removal causes an increase of the physics-to-calibration ratio of 1.4% for single cell injection and of 1.1% for cluster-like injection. These values are in fair agreement with simulations, that predict respectively 1.6% and 1.5%. These results go in the right direction to explain the disuniformities observed in the test beam data, which are however at least a factor of two larger than observed on the mock-up. The simulations prove that the effect of removing one ground spring is due to the inductive nature of the ground reference on the SB, and amounts to \(\sim 0.9\%/\mathrm{nH}\,\times\,L_{x}\), where \(L_{x}\) is the inductance on the SB ground plane existing between two adjacent channels.
