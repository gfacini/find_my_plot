Abstract

A finite element thermal analysis is performed for the various configurations of the ATLAS barrel SCT module. The design of the module are based on the recent proposal by RAL to reduce the overall radiation thickness of the module. Its several variations are also evaluated. The main goal of the present calculation is to estimate the safety margin for the thermal runaway.

## 1 Module models

Eight different module geometries as listed in Table 1 are evaluated.

Figure 1 shows the module

\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline model & description \\ model-RAL & Original model given by RAL in mid March, 1997 \\ model-1 & BeO picture-frame baseboard \\ model-2 & model-1 but with a longer PG basebaord \\ model-3 & model-1 but the baseboard is all made of PG \\ model-4 & model-3 with no thermal connection on the other bridge side \\ model-5 & model-3 added by BeO stiffeners on both sides of PG tongues. \\ model-6 & suggested by Y.

el-RAL proposed by RAL in mid-March 1997. This design is a new attempt in order to reduce the effective material thickness of the ATLAS barrel SCT module.

Triggered by this attempt, variations of the design are proposed at KEK from models 1 to 8. Essential change is the shape and configuration of the baseboard on which both silicon microstrip detectors are attached. The baseboard provides not only the mechanical stiffness for support but also the thermal path from the detector to the cooling channel.

Figure 2 shows the configuration of the baseboard.

## 2 Thermal simulation

A finite-element thermal simulation is done using program ANSYS 5.1. A 3-D thermal and electrical solid elements is used. The thermal conductivity used in the program is listed in Table 2.

For simplicity, the effects of surface convection and radiation emission are not included.

The cooling pipe is not included in the simulation. Instead, the temperature constraint is imposed at the contact of the cooling channel. The open triangle marks in the design figures show the location of this external constraint.

Heat generation in the electronics is simulated by usual bulk heat generation provided in ANSYS. The total heat generation in electronics is 3 or 4 Watts, corresponding to 1.5 or 2 W per side. 87% of the heat is assumed to be generated in the 1st chips (1 x w x h = 7.2 x 4.0 x 0.35 mm\({}^{3}\)) and the rest is generated in the 2nd chip (1 x w x h = 7.2 x 5.5 x 0.35 mm\({}^{3}\)).

The heat generation in the bulk of the radiation-damaged silicon detector is due to the bulk leakage current. The leakage current is known to have a strong temperature dependence:

\[\mathbb{I}_{\text{leak}}\propto\mathbb{T}^{2}\cdot\mathrm{e}^{\frac{\mathbb{E }_{g}}{2\mathbb{R}_{B}\mathbb{T}}}\]

where \(\mathrm{E}_{g}\) is the effective gap energy of about 1.23 eV and \(\mathrm{k}_{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant. In ANSYS program, the electrical resistance of material can be made temperature dependent. An electro-thermal element is assigned for the bulk part of the silicon detector and it is assumed to carry an electrical conductance with the same temperature dependence as that of the leakage current. With this trick, one manages to simulate the temperature dependence of heat generation by the leakage current [1].

The thermal simulation has been demonstrated to work very well when it is compared with the thermal experiments using heater as well as actual radiation damaged detectors [1, 2].

## 3 Results of thermal simulation

### Thermal runaway point

Thermal simulation is performed for various models by varying the heat generation in the detector bulk. Since the heat generation strongly depends on temperature, it is decided to use the heat generation per mm\({}^{2}\) (of 300 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) thick silicon detector) at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C as a standard parameter. Actual heat generation is calculated using the T-dependence give above.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline
**material** & **conductivity (W/m-K)** & **material** & **conductivity (W/m-K)** \\ \hline silicon & 130 & BeO & 280 \\ PG1300 & 1300 (tangential) & PG700 & 700 (tangential) \\  & 3.5 (normal) & & 3.5 (normal) \\ thermal glue & 0.5 & Kapton hybrid & 0.25 \\ air & 0.0245 & BeO hybrid & 280 \\ quartz (fan-in) & 0.15 & bonding wire & 150 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

including safety from the runaway point.

This view is noticed after all the calculation was finished. New series of simulation is of necessity in order to verify the present (tentative) conclusion as well as to find better module design.
