ATLAS Internal Note

29 November 1996

## ATLAS System Organisation

### Preamble

The optimisation and construction of ATLAS as one coherent scientific facility is a large task. The required resources are substantial and the ATLAS collaboration has a responsibility to ensure that these will efficiently produce a facility with the expected performance. This requires an organisation with clear lines of responsibilities. ATLAS is divided into different performance tasks (Systems) and we need one person with an overall responsibility for each of these, the Project Leader. This responsibility requires the full support from the System community which is ensured by the appointment procedure. This appointment procedure is executed with the Project Leader responsibilities open on the table, so that the participating institutes know exactly what they agree to when they select their candidate. The Project Leader is working with a Steering Group which shall be an active body in guiding the System execution.

The System organisation described in this document was approved by the Collaboration Board the 29'th of November 1996.

### System Interaction with the ATLAS Management

An ATLAS System roughly corresponds to a performance task. It is a major activity involving a set of institutions which will produce hardware and software. A System is constrained by a performance specification, and has to work inside a geometrical envelope, schedule and a cost ceiling. This is specified in its Technical Design Report (TDR). The original version of the TDR is submitted to the LHCC for construction approval. It defines the design, production procedure including quality assurance, maintenance, commissioning and sharing of responsibilities. This includes the formal breakdown structures that are linked to the highest levels of the ATLAS breakdown structures, and the scheduling that is included in the overall ATLAS project planning. The internal ATLAS TDR approval procedure is the guarantee that the System is coherent with the overall ATLAS organisation and quality. The TDRs are regularly revised to be consistent with the System being constructed. Depending on the level of changes the revision approvals are done at the System levels, by the technical co-ordination, the Spokesperson or the EB. Changes that could have a major impact on the experiment have to be approved by the CB.

The Project Leader regularly communicates the System status to the ATLAS management and technical co-ordination. The ATLAS management regularly discuss with the Project Leader questions relevant to the System execution and resources.

### General Organisation

The large number of institutions and people involved necessitates a management structure. This management has to have the solid support in the System collaboration and an excellent working relationship with the central ATLAS management team. The day-to-day System execution is lead by the Project Leader who is usually a member of the ATLAS Executive Board. The System has a Steering Group and an Institute Board. If it is convenient for the System, these bodies can be combined in order to be able to carry out the steering and decision making in one group. The Project Leader is the System representative within the ATLAS organisation.

### Steering Groups

Each System shall have a Steering Group reflecting the range of activities within itself and bringing together the people leading these efforts. The Steering Group takes decisions on technical execution matters and make recommendations to the Institute Board on major technical choices and on matters of sharing resources and responsibilities. The Steering Group is chaired by the Project Leader who prepares its agenda. Its members are nominated by the Project Leader based on broad consultation in the System community and approved by the Institute Board. The frequency of Steering Group meetings shall be sufficiently high to ensure the effective leadership of the System execution. The Project Leader shall routinely consult the Steering Group whenever significant issues arise. The ATLAS management members are ex-officio in all Steering Groups.

### Institute Boards

Each System shall have an Institute Board. The Institute Board takes decisions on major technical choices and on sharing of resources and responsibilities. Major technology choices affecting the overall performance of ATLAS have to be brought forward to the collaboration as a whole for decision in the Collaboration Board [1]. The institutions are the source of money and manpower, and therefore all major questionsinvolving sharing of responsibilities and contribution of resources have to be agreed upon by the Institute Board. The Institute Board also proposes the Project Leader candidate for approval by ATLAS, and approves the Steering Group composition. In major matters concerning resources the Institute Board shall invite the ATLAS Resource Co-ordinator.

### Sub-System

Each System may be broken up into smaller organisations, Sub-Systems, which in some cases may more directly correspond to the direct detector construction tasks. These Sub-Systems may well have their internal organisations with Project Leaders, Steering Groups and Institute Boards as described in the System organisation. However, the formal lines of responsibilities to the central ATLAS organisation go through the System Project Leader.

## Work Definition of ATLAS Project Leaders

### Appointment

At latest when entering the TDR phase the Systems shall start the process of appointing the Project Leader.

The Project Leader candidate is nominated by the System participants, short-listed by the Steering Group, elected by the System Institute Board, proposed by the spokesperson to the Collaboration Board and approved by it. The appointment is for two years with the possible extension according to the ATLAS organisation rules[1].

### Mandate

The Project Leader is the person directly and ultimately responsible to the ATLAS collaboration, for ensuring that the design and construction of the corresponding System are carried out on schedule, within the cost ceiling, and in a way that guarantees the required performance and reliability, within the framework of the ATLAS resource planning. He or she collaborate closely with the ATLAS technical and resource co-ordination. The Project Leader shall bring up to discussion, with the ATLAS management, incompatibilities between the requiremented project development and the available resources.

While the responsibility to the ATLAS collaboration remains at all times with the Project Leader, he or she may choose to delegate some tasks, or to appoint people such as project engineer, electronics project engineer, s/w responsible, etc. to assist in managing the project. Such appointments must specify a clear set of responsibilities; they shall be approved by the Steering Group and confirmed by the Institute Board.

The Project Leader chairs the System Steering Group. He or she shall maintain continuous communication with the Steering Group, keeping it up-dated on the development of the project and consulting it on questions of major importance.

In leading the System the Project Leader shall always consider the effect of any decisions taken within the System on the performance and functioning of the ATLAS experiment as a whole.

Typical tasks of the Project Leader include (but are not limited to):

* Preparing all decisions in the sub-detector community, by activating all the necessary studies and forums, thus making sure that everyone has the opportunity to express opinions well before the formal decision is taken by the Steering Group and the Institute Board.
* Maintaining up-to-date knowledge on all activities inside the System either directly or through people to whom co-ordination has been delegated.
* Keeping the System community informed on developments from the central ATLAS co-ordination relevant to the execution of the System.
* The production of the System TDR and its presentation to the LHCC.
* Ensuring a correct distribution and balance of responsibilities among the participating institutions.
* Keeping an updated project plan for the System, including the use of resources (resource loaded project plan), and communicating it to the general ATLAS project planning.
* Representing the System in the Executive Board (Project Leaders and the EB members are subject to endorsement by the CB).
* Organising System collaboration meetings and Steering Group meetings.
* Ensuring that clear work definitions are written for people to whom tasks are permanently delegated, such as the project engineer.
* Ensuring the efficiency of the System execution.
* Ensuring that the System status is regularly communicated to the ATLAS management.
* Bringing to the ATLAS management's attention changes that could affect the rest of the experiment.
