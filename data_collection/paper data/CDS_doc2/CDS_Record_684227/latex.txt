Introduction

The \(Wb\bar{b}\) production at LHC is recognised as a substantial irreducible background for the Standard Model (SM) and Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) Higgs boson search in the associated production, \(WH\), followed by the decay \(H\to b\bar{b}\).

The massive matrix element for \(q\bar{q}\to Wg^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) process has been calculated [1] and interfaced with HERWIG 5.6 Monte Carlo [2] already a few years ago. A more recent implementation of the \(Wbb\) + multijet final states is available from [3]. Recently, the massless matrix element has been implemented in the general purpose Monte Carlo program MCFM [4], where also the radiative corrections to this process are addressed. Massive matrix element implementation is also foreseen for the new release of HERWIG [5] Monte Carlo, version HERWIG 6.3[6].

In this Note we present yet another implementation of the \(q\bar{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) massive matrix elements, this time into PYTHIA 6.1 generator [7]. This process has been implemented as an _external process_. Massive elements have been coded using MADGRAPH package [8]. The phase space generation algorithms, as developed in the NEXTCALIBUR [14], has been adopted instead of the PYTHIA original one.

One has to be aware however, that the \(q\bar{q}\to Wg^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) matrix element is not representing total \(Wb\bar{b}\) cross-section at LHC. The \(gq\to Wq\) subprocess contributes 60% and \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\) contributes only 40% to the total W+parton production. The \(gq\to Wq\) subprocess will contribute to the \(Wb\bar{b}\) events via the \(g^{*}\to b\bar{b}\) splitting in the process of initial or final state radiation. It was estimated in [9], that this contribution would approximately double expected \(q\bar{q}\to Wb\bar{b}\) background to the Higgs searches in the \(WH\) associated production.

## 2 The \(q\bar{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) process

For the discussed here implementation the matrix element was derived using MADGRAPH package [8]. This process is represented by only two Feynman diagrams, with quark exchange in the t-channel, leading the to production of the \(W\)-boson and virtual gluon splitting into \(b\bar{b}\) pair. Only the \(u,d,s,c\) quarks were considered in this implementation, the possibility of the b-quark in the initial state was omitted as expected to be negligible numerically (e.g.. \(|V_{bc}/V_{ud}|^{2}\sim 0.002\)) but leading to several additional diagrams which would have to be included. The massive matrix element takes into account spin correlations in the W-boson decay and angular correlations between leptons and quarks. Due to the massive treatment of the final state fermions the amplitude has no singularities; the total cross-section is well defined. The effect from the \(W\)-boson natural width and the \(W\)-boson propagator are also properly included.

The process \(q\bar{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) has been simulated for pp collision with 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy. The total cross-section, including branching ratio for \(W\to\ell\nu\) (single flavour) is 33.3 pb (CTEQ5L structure functions, \(Q^{2}=M_{W}^{2}\)). This can be compared with the matrix element implementation to HERWIG 5.6, used in [10, 9], where originally this cross-section was estimated to 19.8 pb (CTEQ2L structure functions) but, when implementing CTEQ5L structure functions and setting kinematic parameters to be in accordance with Pythia defaults, rises to 32.7 pb, which is compatible with the present implementation.

Figs. 1 and 2, solid lines, show the most relevant differential distributions for the lepton, lepton-neutrino system (virtual W) and b-quarks originating from the hard process: the transverse momenta, invariant mass distributions and cone separations. These plots are in qualitative agreement with distributions shown in [1]. Some of the shapes are not exactly the same, as implementations differ in the details of the matrix elements modeling, W-boson propagator fully taken into account in the implementation discussed here, and in including the spin and angular correlations in the amplitudes derived with MADGRAPH. The dashed lines correspond to distributions generated with the code from [1] and HERWIG 5.6. Distributions are normalised to the same number of entries. There are clearly slightly different transverse momenta spectra for quarks and leptons, predicted as harder with the new implementation. In the implementation of [1] the width of the W-boson was not included, i.e. only events with constant mass of the \(\ell\nu\) system were generated. While the cone separation between charged lepton and b-quark is very similar, there is noticeable difference in the cone separation of the b-quarks. In [1], the cone separation distribution was enhanced at very low value, just leading to suppression of fraction of events where two b-jets could be reconstructed.

Figure 1: _The transverse momenta distribution of the lepton, transverse momenta and invariant mass distribution of the W and cone separation between lepton and b-quark for the \(Wb\overline{b}\) events are shown. The implementation discussed here is marked with the solid line and the results obtained from [1] with the dashed line._

Figure 2: _The transverse momenta distribution of the individual b-quarks, b-quark system, invariant mass of the b-quark system and cones separation between b-quarks for the \(Wb\bar{b}\) events are shown. Results from implementation discussed here is marked with the solid line and these from [1] with the dashed line._

Table 1 summarizes acceptances and cross-sections for leptons and b-quarks being within standard relevant trigger/fiducial cuts of the ATLAS detector at LHC. Only in 20% of events charged lepton and both b-quarks fall within the acceptance reach; this number is then further reduced by the lepton and jet reconstruction and identification efficiencies. Consequently, only a few percent of \(q\bar{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)g^{*}(\to b\bar{b})\) events will be reconstructed as \(\ell b\bar{b}\) events. This acceptance is rather low, e.g. almost a factor four smaller than the one for the \(WH,H\to b\bar{b}\) events with \(m_{H}~{}=~{}100\) GeV, see [9].

Distributions of the \(q\bar{q}\to Wb\bar{b}\) events have been also compared with the corresponding ones of the \(q\bar{q}\to Zb\bar{b}\) and \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\) events (generated with pure Z-boson exchange) [11]. Some of the relevant distributions are presented in Figs. 3 - 6. Distributions are very similar in case of the \(q\bar{q}\) initial state, due to the fact that equal Feynman diagrams dominate both amplitudes, with the modification of W-boson being replaced by the Z-boson in the final state3. The difference in the transverse momenta spectrum of lepton is due to the higher mass of the Z-boson than the mass of the W-boson, which results in the shifted position of the Jacobian peak. Distributions are however very different in the case of the \(gg\) initial state for the Z-boson production. The \(m_{b\bar{b}}\) mass spectrum for \(q\bar{q}\to Wb\bar{b}\) or \(q\bar{q}\to Zb\bar{b}\) events is much softer than in the case of the \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\) events and is falling very steeply down for the higher masses. Thus in the case of the \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\) events the dominant contribution is given by the b-quark system radiating a Z-boson, while for the \(q\bar{q}\to Wb\bar{b}\) and \(q\bar{q}\to Zb\bar{b}\) processes the dominant amplitudes produce a \(W/Z\) boson recoiling against the b-quark system. This also leads to very different distributions of the cone separation between two b-quarks, \(R_{b\bar{b}}\), when comparing these processes. As it turns out, the differences in \(m_{b\bar{b}}\) mass spectrum and cone separation \(R_{b\bar{b}}\) between the processes \(q\bar{q}\to Wb\bar{b}\) and \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\) are strongly correlated; by imposing a stringent cut on the cone separation of the two b-quarks, e.g. \(R_{b\bar{b}}>1\) in the \(q\bar{q}\to Wb\bar{b}\) production, the \(m_{b\bar{b}}\) mass spectrum becomes much closer in shape to the one expected in the \(gg\to Zb\bar{b}\) process. The evolution of the \(m_{b\bar{b}}\) mass spectrum with a series of cuts on the \(R_{b\bar{b}}\) is shown in Figure 7.

## 3 Phase-space generation

The Feynman diagrams contributing to the \(q\bar{q}\to W(\to\ell\nu)b\bar{b}\) matrix element are just two t-channel diagrams with fermion exchange and double conversion into an off-shell W boson and a virtual gluon; the W boson subsequently decays leptonically into \(\ell\nu\) and the gluon splits into a \(b\bar{b}\) pair (c.f. Figure 8).

The corresponding four-fermion phase space was modeled using the importance sampling technique based on the procedures implemented in the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) event generators _FERMISV_[12], _EXCALIBUR_[13] and _NEXTALIBUR_[14]. In the given implementation, the phase space was generated using two different kinematic diagrams (_channels_). The relative weight between contributions of each sampling channel was then obtained using multi-channel self-optimising approach [15].

The kinematic channel construction being used to mimic the hard process is outlined as follows: The phase space differential \(d\bar{\Phi}\) of the four final-state particles is given by:

\[d\bar{\Phi}=\left(\prod_{i=1}^{4}d^{4}p_{i}\delta(p_{i}^{2}-m_{i}^{2})\theta(p_ {i}^{0})\right)\,\delta^{4}(q_{1}+q_{2}-\sum_{i=1}^{4}p_{i}\,), \tag{1}\]

where the \(p_{i}\) and \(m_{i}\) represent the four-momenta and masses of the final state particles and \(q_{1},q_{2}\) the four-momenta of the incident gluons. The matrix element used in the calculation depends explicitly on the four-momenta of the incoming gluons and outgoing fermions,

\[{\cal M}\,={\cal M}(q_{1},q_{2},p_{1},p_{2},p_{3},p_{4}) \tag{2}\]

therefore all the four-momenta have to be explicitly generated. Since the matrix element calculation takes into account the masses of the final state fermions, there is no need to apply any phase space cuts in order to avoid unphysical singularities.

An event is constructed by sampling values of the following eight independent kinematic variables: (c.f. Fig. 9):

* \(s^{*}_{W}\), the square of the mass of the off-shell \(W^{\pm}\) boson,
* \(s^{*}_{g}\), the square of the mass of the virtual gluon,
* \((\theta^{*}_{W},\phi^{*}_{W})\), the polar angles of the produced \(W^{\pm}\) boson in the centre-of-mass frame of the hard process,
* \((\theta^{*}_{l},\phi^{*}_{l})\), the decay angles of the leptons in the centre-of-mass frame of the decaying \(W^{\pm}\) boson,
* \((\theta^{*}_{b},\phi^{*}_{b})\), the production angles of the \(b\) quark in the centre-of-mass frame of the parent gluon.

In the channel algorithm, the above quantities are sampled from analytically integrable p.d.f.-s which aim to mimic the topology of the process at hand and enable one to generate events using unitary algorithms. Accordingly, the \(s^{*}_{W}\) is generated according to a Breit-Wigner function:

\[\frac{1}{(s^{*}_{W}-M_{W})^{2}+M_{W}^{2}\Gamma_{W}^{2}} \tag{3}\]

and the \(s^{*}_{g}\) is assumed to have an approximate distribution:

\[\frac{1}{(s^{*}_{g})^{\mu}}\hskip 28.452756pt\mu=1.1 \tag{4}\]

After the sampling of the W boson and gluon masses, the cosine of the W boson (and gluon) production angle \(\cos(\theta^{*}_{W})\) is sampled from the distribution:

\[\frac{1}{(A-\cos\theta^{*}_{W})^{\nu}}\hskip 28.452756pt\nu\sim 1, \tag{5}\]

Figure 9: _The variables used for generation of the four momenta according to the event topology introduced by the Feynman diagrams given in Fig. 8._

in order to accommodate the t-channel topology of the process (c.f. Figure 10). The parameter \(A\) is a function of the invariant masses of the sub-system and the particles involved in the scattering, while the angle \(\phi_{W}^{*}\) is derived from an uniform (flat) distribution. Next, taking into account the pure V-A structure of the W boson coupling, the cosine of the lepton production angle \(\cos(\theta_{l}^{*})\) in the W rest frame is sampled from a distribution:

\[(B-\cos\theta_{l}^{*})^{\rho}\hskip 28.452756ptB=1.1,\rho=1.8 \tag{6}\]

where the angle is measured with respect to the beam axis4. The angle \(\phi_{l}^{*}\) is again derived from an uniform distribution, as are also the two angles \((\theta_{b}^{*},\,\phi_{b}^{*})\) describing the b-quark production.

Footnote 4: In absence of gluon radiation the dependence would be exactly \((1-\cos\theta_{l}^{*})^{2}\), conforming to the parity violation; the applied formula accommodates the distortion due to the presence of the radiated gluon.

As it turns out, the Breit-Wigner shape does not give a totally satisfactory description of the differential cross-section dependence on the \(s_{W}^{*}\); using only this generation channel, very large event weights occur at very high \(s_{W}^{*}\) masses, which in turn drastically lowers the unweighting (event generation) efficiency. The observed effect can actually be understood by a 'back of the envelope' calculation: Taking the limit when both W boson and gluon are produced at rest, the product of the Breit-Wigner and the (squared) gluon propagator, which is present in the matrix element, gives:

\[\frac{1}{(s_{W}^{*}-M_{W})^{2}+M_{W}^{2}\Gamma_{W}^{2}}\cdot\frac{1}{\hat{s}-s _{W}^{*}}, \tag{7}\]

where \(\hat{s}\) is the c.m.s. of the hard scattering and the squared mass of the virtual gluon is replaced by: \(s_{g}^{*}=\hat{s}-s_{W}^{*}\). The observed relation clearly shows a bias of the matrix element towards large values in the high \(s_{W}^{*}\) (and low \(s_{g}^{*}\)) region, which is in turn means that a more accurate description of the tails of \(s_{W}^{*}\) distribution is needed. Consequently, the Breit-Wigner sampling function was replaced by:

\[\frac{s_{W}^{*}}{(s_{W}^{*}-M_{W})^{2}+M_{W}^{2}\Gamma_{W}^{2}}, \tag{8}\]

which is proportional to the (more accurate) Breit-Wigner function with an \(s_{W}^{*}\) dependent width. Subsequent studies have shown the high mass tail to be reasonably well described by this dependence as demonstrated in Figure 10. As a result of these studies,the second generation channel was added with the replacement of Breit-Wigner sampling with the above function and the relative weight between the two channels was determined using multi-channel optimisation procedure [15].

The whole event with the appropriate phase space weight is thus constructed in the following way: First the variable \(\tau=\hat{s}/s\) and the pseudo-rapidity \(y\) are sampled from distributions:

\[\frac{1}{(\tau)^{\mu}}\hskip 28.452756pt\mu=1.8, \tag{9}\]

and \(y\) from:

\[\frac{1}{\cosh(\nu y)}\hskip 28.452756pt\nu=0.4, \tag{10}\]where a kinematic limit \(\hat{s}>88\) GeV is used. From the two values \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) and the momenta \(q_{1},q_{2}\) of incoming quarks are derived. Next, the hard process is modeled by using importance sampling from the two kinematic channels and the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing fermions are obtained. Since the incoming quarks are treated as massless, the matrix element value is independent of the incoming quark flavours (the CKM matrix contribution \(|V_{q_{1},q_{2}}|^{2}\) is counted separately). The flavours of the incoming quarks, as well as the W boson (and decay lepton) charge are thus determined by random sampling, using the weights:

\[\lambda_{i}=|V_{q_{i1},q_{i2}}|^{2}\cdot x_{1}f_{q_{i1}}(x_{1},Q^{2})\cdot x_{2 }f_{q_{i2}}(x_{2},Q^{2}), \tag{11}\]

where the index \(i\) runs over all possible quark combinations for both W charges5. Finally, each event is given a weight:

Footnote 5: The \(W^{+}\) and \(W^{-}\) production probability is not equal since e.g. the \(u\overline{d}\) and \(\overline{u}d\) combinations do not have equal structure function weights in proton-proton collisions.

\[wt=\frac{(\sum_{i}\,\lambda_{i})}{(2\pi)^{8}(2\,\hat{s})}\cdot\frac{|{\cal M}| ^{2}}{g_{\Phi}}, \tag{12}\]

where the flux factor \((2\pi)^{8}(2\hat{s})\) and the phase space weight \(g_{\Phi}\) have been added; as one can quickly deduce from the above expression the total cross-section of the process is just the average value of the weight _wt_ over a (large) set of generated events. The unweighted events are obtained by the Monte-Carlo rejection method based on the value of the weight _wt_ with respect to a certain maximal value (obtained by pre-sampling). For further details on the applied importance sampling method and unitary algorithms the reader is referred to the literature (e.g. [12, 14]).

The generated events are then passed to PYTHIA 6.1 event generator, where the fragmentation and hadronisation procedures, as well as the ISR and FSR are added and

Figure 10: _Comparison of the (normalised) distributions of differential cross-section for the process \(q\overline{q}\to Wb\overline{b}\) (dashed) and sampling functions (solid line) with respect to the variables obtained by importance sampling, as described in the text._

unweighted events are produced. The efficiency for generating unweighted events, using the implementation of the phase-space generation presented above, amounts to about 10%. The energy scale \(Q^{2}\) that is used for this process can be set to several values, as described in the next section.

Technical details on implementation in PYTHIA 6.1

The described implementation of the \(q\vec{q}\to Wb\overline{b}\) production is interfaced into PYTHIA 6.1 in the manner prescribed in [17] for external process implementation. The implementation is done similarly as for the \(gg,q\vec{q}\to Z/\gamma^{*}bb\) process [11]. There is a common demo.f main Fortran file and common libraries for the \(Wb\overline{b}\) and \(Zb\overline{b}\) implementations. The interface in demo.f is a bit temporary, we plan that it will evolve during next months as some other processes are being added to the library.

* All \(W\) leptonic decay modes are allowed with massive leptons.
* Only the total cross-section of the process is output by PYTHIA, in case specific decay modes of the b-quarks are required the resulting \(\sigma\times BR\) has to be calculated manually, i.e the cross-section has to be calculated consistently by multiplying the total cross-section with the branching ratios of the allowed decay modes as provided in PYTHIA.

The use of the process implementation in one's own program is basically trivial, there are only a couple of extra switches. The general procedure to put the process in one's own main fortran file is as follows:
