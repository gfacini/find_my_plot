## 1 Introduction

The amount of passive material that will be in front of the ATLAS EM Calorimeter is not yet completely defined. Some calculations have already been performed to study the effect of passive material on the calorimeter performances in different configurations. A very debated question concerns the effectiveness of having either a separate presampler or an optimized massless gap in recovering the resolution in presence of substantial amounts of

The section is taken at \(\eta>0.9\), thus with 1.2 mm Pb thicknesspassive materials[1, 2] All calculations up to now have been performed using GEANT and assuming as a starting point the configuration described in the TP and in [3]. A separate calculation with a different MonteCarlo code seemed worthwhile.

We used the standalone FLUKA[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10] code in its most recent version. We remind that the so-called GEANT-FLUKA program includes only a small subset of the FLUKA physical models, that is the hadronic event generators, in their 1992 version. FLUKA is a complete code, with both hadronic and electromagnetic sectors. The 1995 version of the FLUKA hadronic event generator includes many important improvements with respect to the routines included into GEANT, and its EM part has been demonstrated to be better in many circumstances[4, 11, 12]

We studied the energy resolution of the barrel calorimeter with electrons of 10 and 40 GeV transverse energy, in two \(\eta\) positions, with and without a separate presampler, with layers of passive material added in front of the calorimeter.

## 2 Geometry

The accordion geometry has been modelled in detail, as shown in fig.1, including all absorber and electrode layers, and keeping the dimensions and

the bending parameters as in the TP model[3, 1]. A 3 cm massless gap has been included in the first sampling. No attempt to optimize this thickness has been performed. The first sampling is tapered with \(\eta\), giving a constant depth along the shower direction of \(4.5X_{0}\). The segmentation along \(\eta\) is introduced in the scoring procedure, while the granularity along \(\phi\) is obtained by grouping the LAr gaps. The basic cell has the TP granularity \(\Delta\eta=0.025,\ \Delta\phi=2\pi/256\). In the first sampling the \(\eta\) strips segmentation scheme has been applied. The dimensions and composition of the cables/clearances/cryost at have been taken from [3].

The presampler dimensions are again taken from [3]. The active layer has been simulated as a homogeneous mixture of Liquid Argon and Copper, without detailing the electrode-gap structure. A simulation performed in a test-beam geometry showed that this approximation has no influence on the results (except, obviously, for the absolute value of the detected energy and thus for the presampler weight). A section of the resulting geometry is shown in fig.2

The configuration without presampler has been simply obtained by substituting the presampler regions (active layer, resine, electronics and cabling) with void. In this way, no optimization of the calorimeter dimensions has been performed, in contrast with [2] where the longitudinal extra space is used to reduce the thickness of the absorber plates.

The inner detector geometry is based on the description given in [14]. The resulting amount of material in front of the presampler and calorimeter is shown in fig 3. It is in agreement with the distributions presented in [1, 2].

The magnetic field in the inner cavity is simulated as a 2 Tesla solenoid dial field.

## 3 Simulations

Since the effect of passive material is expected to be larger for electrons than for photons, and should also be more evident at low energies, we simu

\(0.25X_{0}\), \(0.5X_{0}\), and \(0.75X_{0}\) of passive material.

A cluster size of 3 cells along \(\eta\) and 7 along \(\phi\) has been used for the calorimeter. For the presampler, either the whole area or a window of the same geometrical size of the calorimeter cluster has been used.

The "measured" energies \(E_{r}\) have been reconstructed applying two independent weights to the energies deposited in the active media of the presampler (if there) and of the first sampling of the calorimeter:

\[E_{r}=\alpha E_{\it pres\,sampler}+\delta E_{\it 1stsampling}+E_{\it 2n\,d+3rdsamp.} \tag{1}\]

The use of a weight for the first sampling should compensate for the non

optimization of the massless gap. The weights have been determined by minimizing the fractional energy resolution \(\frac{\sigma(E_{r})}{E_{r}}\).

The obtained energy distributions have been fitted with a gaussian shape in a \(\pm 2\sigma\) interval. From the obtained resolution a "local" sampling term \(\sigma_{s}\) has been defined from the approximate relation:

\[\frac{\sigma(E_{r})}{E_{r}}\approx\frac{\sigma_{s}}{\sqrt{E}}\]

where E is the original electron energy.

The tails of the energy distribution have been estimated as the difference between the integrated spectrum and the area of the fitted gaussian. Examples of fits are presented in fig.4.

## 4 Results

Results are interesting in three aspects: the effect of the material itself and its dependence on energy, the different capabilities of the two models (presampler vs no presampler) to compensate for it, and an unespected effect of the presampler clusterisation.

The effect of the additional material is most dramatic at 10 GeV \(E_{T}\), as shown in figs 5 and 6. The sampling term at \(\eta=0.17\) grows from the usual 9% value, TP configuration, to more than 12% with \(0.75X_{0}\) added, and at \(\eta=1.2\) the growth is from 13% to more than 18%, using the presampler, while without presampler it rises to 26%. It must be reminded that the "basic" amount of passive material is already 1.79 \(X_{0}\) and 3.22 \(X_{0}\) at the two eta values. At 40 GeV \(E_{T}\) we have results only at \(\eta=1.2\) (fig. 7), and here the effect of the material is reduced: without presampler the sampling term stays below 22%.

The effectiveness of the presampler shows up more clearly at 40 GeV (see again fig.7), where it allows to keep the resolution at about 12.5% even with 0.75 \(X_{0}\) added. This is not the case at 10 GeV, probably because the development of the shower and its opening at the level of the calorimeter is in a too advanced state to be reconstructed anyhow.

In this context, fig.8 shows the effect of the preshower clusterization. Sampling terms obtained with the full presampler and the cluster differ significatively at 10 GeV and the difference grows with the number of \(X_{0}\), probably because at low energies the shower has already a quite large transverse

dimension, with big fluctuations, at the level of the presampler. It is worthwhile to remind that the extra material is placed just before the cryostat, in a region with magnetic field. This clusterization effect disappears at 40 GeV.

The behaviour of the tails in the energy distributions is shown in fig.9 as a function of the extra material. Tails obtained in the configuration with

presampler stay almost constant, while those in the no-presampler configuration decrease when adding material, being inglobed in the broadening of the gaussian width.

A summary of the results is presented in fig.10 as a function of the total thickness in front of the active layers. Points at \(\eta=0.17\) and \(\eta=1.2\) have

been put together in this figure, since in principle they differ only for the passive material in front of the cryostat: in the baseline configuration there are \(1.79X_{0}\) at \(\eta=0.17\), and \(3.22X_{0}\) at \(\eta=1.2\). The points do indeed follow a smooth dependence on the amount of passive material. The behaviour at different \(\eta\) positions could therefore be extrapolated from numbers in fig. 10 by calculating the correct number of passive \(X_{0}\)'s. In principle this procedure would be more exact in the case of a continuously varying absorber thickness,

but it is a good approximation also in the real situation of a single thickness change at \(\eta=0.9\). It is evident that a model with presampler can withstand additional passive layers of material, except for the lowest energies. A model without presampler seems adequate with the amount of passive material foreseen in the TP configuration, where it gives sampling terms comparable to the ones of the model with presampler, but runs into troubles as soon as "some" extra material is added. The effect of this sampling term deterioration on the search of physics channels can be determined only by means of a global study of all the the parameters that enter in the reconstruction of the physical quantities.
