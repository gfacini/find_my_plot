###### Abstract

It is foreseen to assemble and test \(\sim\)600 silicon detector modules of the Forward Silicon Tracker (SCT), using facilities at CERN and the University of Geneva [1]. The mechanical tolerances of the modules being constructed are stringent [2], making the large scale fabrication of detector modules a challenge. An assembly procedure has been developed with the aim of meeting the required mechanical tolerances. The production of four prototype mechanical modules using this procedure is described. Improvements of the assembly technique planned for the production of future forward modules are outlined.

Introduction

The CERN-Geneva cluster [1] is responsible for the construction and test of \(\sim\)600 outer forward detector modules of the ATLAS silicon tracker. Following the procurement and test of module components by institutes of the cluster, it is foreseen that the modules will be assembled and subsequently tested using facilities at CERN and the University of Geneva UniGe). Additional modules will also be assembled in Melbourne using similar facilities.

The UniGe and CERN are now studying the feasibility of large-scale module assembly in series production.

A first step in this study is to develop an assembly procedure that minimizes possible deviations from the required mechanical tolerances, and to subsequently test the performance of the procedure. The purpose of this note is to describe the assembly method, and to report on results obtained so far following the fabrication of four prototype modules. In particular, problems encountered during fabrication of the first module resulted in changes applied to the assembly of the next module. The note concludes with some possible future improvements to the tooling and to the assembly technique. A subsequent step will be the optimization of the procedure for large-scale fabrication.

An alternative assembly based on ideas of using another touching approach [3] is also being evaluated, and will be described separately.

## 2 Module design and required module tolerances.

Figure 1 shows the current detector dimensions of the Outer Forward Silicon module for the SCT. The figure also shows a scale drawing of the completed module, and the different components of the module. Two pairs of modules are glued back-to-back to a TPG spine, at angles of respectively \(\pm\)20 mrads. to the centre line of the spine.

## 3 Assembly procedure

A manual module assembly tooling has been developed using the principle of touching dowel pins to locate two detector pairs and a spine to form an SCT Outer Forward Module. The module is assembled between two vertical "Reference Dowels".

A Mitutoyo Co-ordinate Measurement Machine (CMM), equipped with pattern recognition software and miniature x-y-\(\theta\) stages, is used to align the detector pairs. Vacuum transfer plates are used to assemble the baseline spine to the detector pairs during the gluing phase.

### Assembly description

a) As shown in Figure 3, self-alignment of the sensor transfer plates is obtained using a set of 2 vertical dowels, perpendicular to the plane of the module. The first dowel defines a _Reference Point_, and the second dowel defines the _Alignment on the plane_.

b) Both the detector alignment jig and the module-gluing base have their own vertical precision dowels, as shown in Figure 4.

c) The detector-pair _Transfer Plates_ and the _Spine Assembly Plate_ are individually located against the vertical "Reference Dowel" by touching two smaller dowel pins forming a 90-Degree built-in "V", perpendicular to the "Reference Dowel". A plastic screw ensures the compres

The alignment of each transfer and assembly plate is obtained using only one built-in pin perpendicular to the vertical "Alignment Dowel". Plastic screws are also used to maintain position (see Figure 5).

d) The rotation of detector pairs by \(\pm\)20 mrad about the module centre-point position in the "R-axis" is obtained by offsetting the detectors compared to the axis formed by the reference and the alignment of the dowels (Figure 6).

e) Once a detector pair is rotated by \(+\)20 mrad in relation to the vertical alignment dowels on the transfer plate, the stereo angle of \(-\)20 mrad of the future module is then obtained by mirroring the

detector pairs. The spine assembly and positioning of "PEEK" precision pieces is made along the axis of the vertical Alignment Dowels.

f) When this is complete, the spine and the transfer plates can be stacked on to the module-gluing base to form a module (see Figure 7).

### Assembly Tools

For the fabrication of the modules, the assembly tools were kept in a clean room of class 1000 with controlled temperature (21 \(\pm\) 1\({}^{\circ}\)C) and humidity (\(<\) 50%) control. It should be noted that with the prototype aluminium jigs now being used, the temperature control results in a limiting longitudinal accuracy of approximately \(\pm\)2.8 \(\upmu\)m (production jigs will be fabricated of stainless steel).

#### a) Metrology

The Mitutoyo Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) is a powerful machine which is used for successive coordinate measurement steps (including the alignment of pairs of detectors) during the module assembly, and for the metrology of completed modules.

The CMM accurately measures the position of any point in the 3 dimensions using either a mechanical touch probe or a video camera with pattern recognition code that is useful for silicon detectors. The absolute accuracy of the machine over the 1 m\({}^{2}\) of active table area is 2-3 \(\upmu\)m, with measurement reproducibility using the touch probe of \(<\)1 \(\upmu\)m.

Using the video camera with pattern recognition, the measurement reproducibility over a surface equivalent to the area of a module is measured to be less than 1 \(\upmu\)m in the X- and Y-axis (0.4 \(\upmu\)m rms). Since the measurement in \(z\) is determined from the camera focus in the case of optical measurements, the measurement is less accurate, with a rms measurement error of 3 \(\upmu\)m. Figure 8 shows the result of successive optical measurements in each coordinate.

Figure 7: **Module gluing base with transfer plates.**

#### b) Glue dispenser

A PC using custom software was used to control the glue dispenser that is used for the prototype studies. The X and Y stages have a precision of 1 \(\upmu\)m. The dispenser uses a standard syringe with an appropriate needle, with the flow controlled by pressure monitored and controlled by the PC.

The glue pattern of the glue is drawn in the scale of the module using a standard drawing tool (AutoCAD), and a Java application creates an output file in an appropriate format. The glue pattern is easy to draw and allows excellent flexibility.

In view of the expected change of the glue viscosity of Araldite 2011 filled with boron nitride1, it was previously demonstrated that even with 3 bar air pressure put on a standard syringe2, normal dispensing can be performed over at least 40 minutes after the glue preparation. Furthermore no volumetric glue dispenser is required for this operation.

Footnote 1: It was decided in February 2000 that boron nitride would not be used in the assembly procedure.

#### c) Tooling and assembly jigs

The assembly jigs were fabricated in-house using numerically controlled machine tools. The jigs were made of aluminium for reasons of practicality; inox will be used for the production jigs. Where necessary (for example the vacuum chucks), the jigs are coated with Teflon to protect the detectors and other module components.

The assembly jigs include:

* a detector-pair alignment jig that includes two small x-y-q manual stages and the "Reference Dowel" and the "Alignment Dowel,
* a module-gluing base which includes the "Reference Dowel" and the "Alignment Dowel,
* two detector-pair vacuum transfer-plates for the F-side and the Stereo-side detectors,
* a spine construction plate with vacuum chuck,
* a tool for the stereo fan-in alignment and gluing,
* a fan-in alignment and gluing bridge piece.

## 4 Module assembly sequence

### 4.1 **Spine construction**

The assembly sequence of components to form the module spine is schematically represented in Figure 9. The successive steps are as follows:

1. The hybrid and stereo fan-in are glued separately under vacuum as shown in Figure 9a. (20 min.)

2. The spine ceramic and TPG pieces are put together and glued to the hybrid by the _stereo_ fan-in (see Figure 9b). Vacuum is used for positioning all parts, and pressure is used to set the thickness of the glue (only the glue thickness is critical). (80 min.)

3. The \(\Phi\)-side fan-ins are glued to bridge the upper side of the spine inner-rib and the hybrid (20 min.).

4. The Peek positioning pieces are finally glued onto the complete spine, as shown in Figure 9c. (15 min.).

5. The thickness of the assembled spine is controlled, as shown in Figure 9d for the case of the spine for Module 1. (15 min.)

**The total time need for the assembly and inspection of the spine is 2.5 hours plus overnight glue curing.**

Figure 9: **Spine construction design and pictures.**

### Alignment of detector pairs (Figure 10).

The relative alignment of the detector-pairs is made using the Mitutoyo CMM. The touch probe and the video camera are both used to define the axis reference of the assembly. The theoretical position of the central detector fiducials defined for the symmetry of the module is given in the drawing relative to the "Reference Dowel".

The alignment sequence is as follows:

1. The x-y-\(\Theta\) stages have Teflon coated vacuum chucks and are separated by a kapton foil. They are pre-positioned prior to the manipulation of the detectors (Figure 10a).
2. The two detectors are first manually positioned and pre-aligned against plastic pins and the kapton foil (5 min.).
3. The kapton foil is removed by retracting the inner-detector (W31) and a "safety gap" is created.
4. Travelling the camera across the detector guard ring width allows the pre-alignment of the wafer edge. (10 min.)
5. The pattern recognition parameters are checked for each pair of detectors.
6. The camera is moved to the theoretical fiducial positions.
7. Both detectors are moved manually to match these positions (Figure 10b). (15 min.)
8. When the detectors are positioned, the detector pair transfer plate is installed.

Figure 10: Pictures of the alignment and the transfer of a detector pairsThe transfer plate is manually aligned using the vertical "Reference and Alignment Dowels".

10. The detector fiducials are inspected looking through matching transfer plate ports to correct any possible shift of the detectors during loading with the transfer plate. (30 min.)

11. The detectors are collected (Figure 10c).

**The alignment of one detector-pair is completed in one hour.**

### Gluing (Figure 11)

The gluing of the detector pairs to the central spine is done in 2 steps. The \(\Phi\)-side is first joined to the central spine, which is spread with glue and positioned to the "Reference and Alignment Dowel". The thickness of the half-module is controlled using shims. The module is completed in a second step when the stereo side is joined to the half module with glue spread on the other side of the spine.

The gluing procedure has the following steps:

1. The \(\Phi\)-side detectors are put on the gluing base and are aligned using the "Reference and Alignment Dowels (Figure 11a).
2. The assembled spine on its plate with its precision positioning pins is spread with glue. (30 min.)
3. Thickness shims are put along the sides of the \(\Phi\)-side detector plate.

Figure 11: Pictures of the gluing procedure.

* The spine assembly plate is aligned on the gluing base and is pressed against the shims. (5 min.)
* After the curing of the glue, the precision spine pins are retracted through the spine plate.
* The spine plate is removed.
* The half module is inspected before the next gluing step. (15 min.)
* The half module spine is covered with glue and aligned on the gluing base (Figure 11c). (30 min.)
* Thickness shims are put along the sides of the half module.
* 10-Stereo side detectors are aligned on the gluing base and are pressed against the shims. (5 min.)

**The time needed to prepare the gluing of the module is estimated to be ~1.5 hours.**

**The total time for the full construction of the first prototype module is estimated to be \(\leq\)6 hours. This could be reduced during the serial production.**

## 5 Metrology measurements

The internal alignment of the module with respect to some fixation point is an important issue that determines the precision of track reconstruction. As noted in Section 2, the alignment accuracy in the local XYZ coordinates is as given in Table 2[2].

As previously noted, the metrology was performed using a Mitutoyu CMM table having both mechanical and optical probes. A satisfactory metrology requires that the CMM performance is stable, and that the shape and the contrast of the fiducials are well defined.

A baseboard is used to hold the module without stress in a well-defined position, for x-y-z metrology measurements on both sides of a module.

### Alignment in the detector plane (XY)

As explained in [2], the fiducials 52 and 53 (see Figure 2) defining the reference wafer are measured on the hybrid side. The equivalent fiducials 51 and 50 on the far end detector (wedge W32) are used to obtain the relative alignment on one side. The relative alignment between the 2 sides using the precision hole as reference is given by looking at the difference of the x- and y- positions of the fiducials 52 and 53.

The tolerance required to meet the 4 \(\upmu\)m rms accuracy on those fiducials in the x-coordinate are as given in Table 1. The tolerance on the absolute position is more relaxed than for the relative detector alignment. Assuming that the relative alignment of each pair of detectors is good (as is the case for module 2), one can use the calculated position of the middle of each pair to evaluate the relative difference of the 2 sides.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|} \hline Local direction & X & Y & Z \\  & parallel to strips & perpendicular to strips & out of plane \\ \hline Required alignment & 17 & 4 & 66 \\ accuracy (\(\upmu\)m) & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Requirements for the internal wafer alignement in the local directions.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

The profile measurement of Figure 12 allows an estimate of both the module thickness uniformity and the module distortion. The module thickness is very uniform (Figure 13) with a maximum rms spread of 12 \(\upmu\)m (Table 3). The mean module thickness is close to the theoretical value of 1.20 mm.

### Metrology after thermal cycling

Both the distortion and the permanent deformation are important to study during thermal cycling. Any reasonable distortion of a module should stay below the (x,y,z) specification of accuracy defined in see Table 1.

The effect of several thermal cycling between room temperature to \(-10^{\circ}\)C and \(-20^{\circ}\)C (1 cycle at \(-10^{\circ}\)C, 3 cycles at \(-10^{\circ}\)C and 1 cycle at \(-20^{\circ}\)C) has been studied for both module #1 and module # 2. During each cycle the module was left at a low temperature during 30 minutes. The modules were left unfixed and free from any external mechanical stress.

Figure 13: The measured thickness distribution for each of module #1 and #2.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:14]

The transfer method used for module 1 was to:

1. Align on the X,Y,0 stages;
2. Put the transfer plate on top of the detector and then set to the dowel references;
3. Apply suction on the transfer plate and then cut suction on the alignment stages.

To better understand any possible shift during the transfer step, the position of the middle fiducials used for the alignment through the transfer plate was checked. For this operation, 3 holes were drilled in the transfer plates. When putting the transfer plate on top of the aligned detectors systematic shifts of up to 6 \(\upmu\)m in the x- and y-axes were measured. This is thought to be due to the weight of the transfer plate, which slightly moves the stages. Each detector sits on top of a stack of 3 stages and the lever arm is non-negligible in that case.

A solution to this problem was to initially pre-align the detectors and then to tune the alignment with the transfer plate on top of the detectors. Only a few manipulation tests were performed and no significant shift was observed after several detector transfers. This alignment method was applied on the following modules.

### Dowel reference pins

The shift between the 2 sides of each module could be explained by a small deviation from perpendicularity of the 2 dowel reference pins on the gluing baseboard. When mounting and gluing the 2 sides together, the contacts of the detector transfer plates between the 2 sides are located with a vertical separation of 17 mm. For the x- direction the shift was measured to be - 4 \(\upmu\)m due to the inclination over the 17 mm between the 2 contacts (see Figure 14). The y-axis deviation was measured to be \(-\)5 \(\upmu\)m.

A difference of the diameter of the dowel pins of the alignment base plate and the gluing base plate, will play an additional role in any y- deviation, making a total expected shift of - 4 \(\upmu\)m in both the x- and y-axis.

The metrology of the middle virtual point for module 2 has shown a shift of \(-\)6 \(\upmu\)m in x and \(-\)2 \(\upmu\)m in y. Compensation was be applied for the construction of the 4\({}^{\mathrm{th}}\) module.

## 7 Conclusions

Experience gained during the assembly of 4 prototype modules for the outer forward modules of the SCT give confidence in the ability of the CERN-Geneva cluster to assemble modules within the required ATLAS mechanical specifications.

The assembly technique used relies on existing facilities within the cluster. The assembly jigs are simple and easy to produce within required tolerances, allowing the possibility of parallel assembly of several modules using multiple jig sets.

A number of problems were found and solved during the assembly of the 4 prototype modules. Two major problems were identified: a shift due to the detector transfer operation, and a small error of perpendicularity of the dowel pin compared to the detector surface. Solutions were found to both problems, and the last constructed module of the series has a fabrication accuracy well within the tolerances.

The construction time was \(\sim\) 6 hours for each module, including the time taken for the spine construction. It is estimated that this time could be reduced by up to 30%, by optimizing the assembly technique and by automatizing the detector alignment operation. A simplification of the spine assembly could further reduce the time.

On-going development work includes:

a) The manual detector alignment procedure which requires considerable concentration, is being automatized, and a significant gain of time is expected;

b) The design and fabrication of new tooling adapted to the new alignment system, hopefully with a continuing improvement in the assembly technique and the consequent mechanical accuracy, is being developed;

c) Further prototype modules will be fabricated using the automatized procedure, to ensure that the accuracy can be maintained in series production;

d) A comparison with a different assembly technique [3] for which (with a slightly modified module design) the gluing steps for both module sides are simultaneous, has been made. Some advantages of another alternative [3] are being considered.
