During summer 99', test beam measurements have been performed on the Module 0 of the EM barrel calorimeter. Physics and calibration runs have been taken in order to test the performances and our understanding of the module. The granularity of its different layers is reminded in figure 26 in appendix 1.

One important feature concerns the crosstalk between the different parts of the calorimeter, namely the signal that flows in the other cells when one cell records a physical signal. This crosstalk can occur on the electrodes themselves or through the electronic chain, which can be modelised by a network of resistances, capacitances and inductances. Consequently, each component will give rise to a specific crosstalk, called resistive, capacitive or inductive. It can be measured using calibration runs. During such a run, several cells are pulsed simultaneously, according to the patterns presented in figure 27 in appendix 1. In order to evaluate the most relevant quantities with respect to physics understanding, it has been tried whenever possible to normalise the results to the case where only one cell is pulsed. This is the case everywhere, except when the crosstalk is mainly inductive (see section 4) or is a "long distance" one (see section 5).

We can define the crosstalk value:

* by the maximum amplitude of the crosstalk signal \(\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{max}}\) normalised to the maximum amplitude of the signal \(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{max}}\) in the pulsed channel. This will be referenced in the following as the **peak-peak definition**,
* by the amplitude of the crosstalk signal at the pulsed signal peak \(\mathrm{X}(\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{max}})\) normalised to \(\mathrm{V}_{\mathrm{max}}\). This will be referenced in the following as the **t\({}_{\mathrm{max}}\) definition**.

These quantities are illustrated in figure 1.

Even if the \(\mathrm{t}_{\mathrm{max}}\) definition gives in principle the most relevant quantities (because the signals are sampled at the pulsed signal peak), it is very time sensitive and thus is subject to large fluctuations. The peak-peak definition gives the most pessimistic value but allows a clearer understanding of the crosstalk. It has to be taken as an upper limit of the crosstalk.

Figure 1: Diagram of a pulsed signal and a crosstalk signal and related quantities that enter in the definition of the crosstalk value.

The main sources of crosstalk between all the cells of the barrel have been identified and quantified. The singular crosstalk values are explained and correlated with test bench measurements whenever possible. The crosstalk between strips, which is mainly capacitive, is presented in section 2. Then the resistive crosstalk between the middle sampling and the strips is treated in section 3. As detailed in section 4, the crosstalks in the middle and the back samplings (middle-middle, middle-back, back-middle and back-back) are dominated by the inductive coupling coming from the summing board connectors laying on the mother boards. Finally, the long distance crosstalk (back-strips and middle-strips), dominated by effects in the calibration board and in the feedthroughs, is presented in section 5.

We concentrated our analysis on the \(\Phi_{\mathrm{strip}}=2\) line (i.e. \(\Phi_{\mathrm{middle}}=8\), 9, 10 and 11) of the module 0, which is equipped with "good" electrodes [1]. The first strip (number 1) is not connected. It explains all the singular points related to this strip that appear in the plots along the note. Moreover, every electronic cell will be referenced by its eta coordinate which corresponds to its cell number (denoted \(\eta_{\mathrm{\ layer}}\)).

In order to deal with relevant physical quantities, gain factors for each cell have been applied. They take mainly into account the injection resistances, the resistivity of the transmission cables and the different gains of the pre-amplifiers and of the shapers. They allow to convert ADC counts to energy measurements. The ratios between these gains in the different samplings are shown in figure 2. The results presented in this note take these factors into account.

Figure 2: Ratios of the gain factors (MeV/ADC) between the middle cells and the strips (top), the back cells and the strips (centre) and the middle cells and the back ones (bottom) as a function of \(\eta\). These correction factors have been applied through the note.

Capacitive crosstalk

An important source of crosstalk in highly segmented detectors comes from a capacitive coupling between the different cells. This is the dominant coupling between the fine segmented strips of the EM barrel calorimeter front sampling. It is not the case for the less segmented middle and back samplings, where the inductive coupling dominates (see section 4). This section focuses on the strip-strip capacitive coupling.

This coupling can be illustrated as in figure 3, where C\({}_{\mathrm{x}}\) is the crosstalk capacitance between the strips at the level of the signal layer and C\({}_{\mathrm{HV}}\) is the capacitance between the high voltage and the signal layers.

During the beam tests, calibration runs have been taken by pulsing the strips following the pattern shown in figure 27. The amplitude of the signal recorded in each pulsed strip (the 448 strips of the \(\Phi_{\mathrm{strip}}=2\) line) is shown in figure 4. The strips 185 and 186 are short-circuited (short in the signal layer). Therefore, the signal in these cells is only one half of the input pulse.

### Signal shapes

Typical shapes of the crosstalk signals in the first and in the second neighbours of a pulsed strip are shown in figure 5. As expected from calculations [2], the signal in the first neighbours is close to the derivative of the pulsed signal. It is a bit slower than the perfect derivative mainly because of the slower rise time of the pre-amplifier with respect to the shaping time. In the second neighbours, some contributions seem to add to a pure capacitive coupling, since the signal is a bit distorted with respect to the second derivative of the pulsed signal. These shapes show nevertheless that the dominant source of crosstalk between strips is due to a coupling capacitance.

### Crosstalk Measurements

#### 2.2.1 Results

For a given pulsed cell (n), we have measured the crosstalk in its left (n-1) and right (n+1) first neighbours and left (n-2) and right (n+2) second neighbours (when they exist). The crosstalk values obtained with both definitions (peak-peak and \(t_{\max}\)) are shown in figure 6. The corresponding distributions are presented in figure 7. Note that the strips (n\(\pm\)2) have two pulsed second neighbours (the strips (n) and (n\(\pm\)4)). The crosstalk values in this case have been divided by two to normalise the results to one pulse.

Figure 7: Distributions of the capacitive crosstalk between one pulsed strip and its right and left (a) first and (b) second neighbours. The upper (resp. lower) plots correspond to the peak-peak (resp. \(t_{\max}\)) definition.

The main quantitative results are the following:

* **The mean crosstalk between one strip and its first neighbour is 7.25% (resp. 4.3%) using the peak-peak (resp. \(\rm t_{max}\)) definition.**
* **These quantities are 0.9% (resp. 0.3%) for the second neighbours.**

They correspond to a coupling capacitance \(\rm C_{x}\) of about 50 pF.

#### 2.2.2 Singular crosstalk values

The 3 types of singular crosstalk values that can be seen in figure 6 and that are in the tails of the plots of figure 7 can be explained:

* The first type of singular crosstalk values is due to the short between the strips 185 and 186. The crosstalk between these strips is 100%. It also affects a few other crosstalk values. For example, when the strip 184 is pulsed, the crosstalk signal in the strip 185 is shared with the strip 186. Thus, the crosstalk in 185 is half of the standard (n+1) crosstalk. It is the same than the crosstalk in 186, which is higher than the standard (n+2) crosstalk. This feature explains easily and quantitatively the few singular points seen in figure 6 corresponding to the strips 183 to 188. This short in the signal layer had been previously detected in test bench in Paris [3] on the electrode _#211qual98300053_.
* One also sees in figure 6 (a) four (n\(\pm\)1) high crosstalk values (around 15%). They concern the couples of strips (40;41), (95;96), (157;158) and (226;227). They are due to shorts in the HV layers [2]. Namely, if there is a short between two strips in one HV layer, two HV capacitances in series contribute also to the coupling capacitance (see figure 3): \[\rm C^{\prime}_{x}=C_{x}+C_{HV}/2\] As \(\rm C_{HV}\sim 200\) pF in the strips and \(\rm C_{x}\sim 50\) pF, we have in this case \(\rm C_{x}\sim 150\) pF, which corresponds to a crosstalk around 15% [2]. These 4 shorts in the HV layers had also been detected in test bench [3]. They are on the electrodes _#211qual98300054_ (strips (95;96)), _#211qual98300056_ (strips (40;41) and (157;158)) and _#211qual98470090_ (strips (226;227)).
* The third singular crosstalk values that can be seen in figure 6 (a) concern one couple of strips over 16 (resp. 8) in the A electrode i.e. for \(\eta_{\rm\,strip}\leq 256\) (resp. in the B electrode i.e. for \(\eta_{\rm\,strip}>256\)). Their crosstalk is lower of roughly 2% than the other ones. This could be due to a coupling in the summing board connectors laying on the front mother board. The scheme of this board is presented in figure 28. There is one summing board connector every 16 (resp. 8) strips in the A electrode i.e. for \(\eta<0.8\) (resp. in the B electrode i.e. for \(0.8<\eta<1.4\) ). If there is a coupling between two adjacent pins (corresponding to two neighbour strips) of these connectors, the crosstalk between these strips would be enhanced. It would not be the case for two neighbour strips whose corresponding pins do not belong to the same connector. This occurs for one couple of strips over 16 (resp. 8) in the A electrode (resp. in the B electrode). Note that for technical reasons, 3 points are missing (strips couples (128,129), (256,257) and (384,385)). As there is one delay run for each half electrode, the two strips of each couple do not belong to the same data file.

Thus, the crosstalk between two neighbour strips would be due to a capacitive coupling between the signal layers ( \(\sim\) 5%) and a coupling between the corresponding pins in the summing board connector of the mother board ( \(\sim\) 2%), except for the couples whose pins do not belong to the same connector. As shown in figure 8, the crosstalk signals in both cases have the same capacitive shape. So, both couplings are capacitive.

As a conclusion, we would like to emphasize that the 5 shorts (1 in the signal layer and 4 in the HV layers) that had been detected during test bench measurements in the \(\Phi_{\mathrm{strip}}=2\) region have been seen in the test beam results. There is no mismatch between benches and beam tests. This confirms the good quality and the relevance of the test bench measurements.

## 3 Resistive crosstalk

This section focuses on middle cells to strips and strips to middle cells crosstalk. These two samplings are physically connected with resistors on the electrodes. The dominant crosstalk comes from this resistive coupling.

### Signal shapes

Identification of crosstalk type is confirmed by looking at the signal shapes. Figure 9 (a) shows typical shapes of crosstalk signals when a middle cell is pulsed. In order to emphasize the resistive part of the crosstalk in the strips in front of the pulsed middle cells (shape 2), the long distance crosstalk corresponding to the signal in the strips which are not in front of a pulsed middle cell (shape 3) has been subtracted. In these conditions, peak-peak definition and t\({}_{max}\) definition are equivalent. The study of the long distance crosstalk is performed in section 5.1.

Figure 9 (b) shows shapes of the crosstalk signal in a middle cell when a strip in front of it is pulsed. Because of the calibration pattern of the front sampling, it is impossible to subtract the long distance contribution in this case. For this reason, crosstalk shapes do not exhibit a pure resistive coupling. As a consequence, the t\({}_{max}\) definition will differ slightly from the peak-peak one.

Figure 9: Crosstalk shapes from test beam data (a) in strips when middle cells are pulsed and (b) in a middle cell when strips are pulsed. In (a), the pulsed signal in a middle cell (1), the pure resistive crosstalk in a strip in front of it (2) and the long distance crosstalk in a distant strip (3) are shown. The crosstalk signals are magnified by a factor 100. In (b), the pulsed signal in a strip (1) and the total crosstalk in a middle cell in front of it (2) are shown. The crosstalk signals are magnified by a factor 400.

### Middle cells to strips resistive crosstalk results

During the beam tests, calibration runs were taken by pulsing the middle cells with the pattern shown in figure 27. In front of one strip, two middle cells are pulsed simultaneously in \(\phi\). The following results have been normalised to the case where only one middle cell is pulsed by dividing the crosstalk by a factor two.

For a given middle cell, the crosstalk is measured in the 8 strips in front of it. These strips are connected to the middle with resistors through which the resistive crosstalk occurs. Other effects have been subtracted using distant strip signals (see section 3.1). The evolution of the pure resistive crosstalk with \(\eta\) is shown in figure 10 (a) for the middle cells belonging to the calibration lines 1 and 3 and 10 (b) for the ones of the calibration lines 2 and 4. The corresponding distributions are presented in figure 11. Note that whatever the calibration line is, the crosstalk is similar in shape and in amplitude.

The main feature is an increase of the crosstalk with \(\eta\). Its importance depends on the electrode type:

* A electrode (\(\eta=1\to 256\)) : the values of the crosstalk vary from 0.03% up to 0.07%,
* B electrode (\(\eta=257\to 448\)) : the values of the crosstalk vary from 0.07% up to 0.29%

Figure 10: Resistive crosstalk measurements between one pulsed middle cell and strips. The middle cell is pulsed with calibration lines 1-3 (a) and 2-4 (b). Peak-peak definition and t\({}_{max}\) definition are equivalent.

The pure resistive crosstalk is expected to be inversely proportional to the resistance values on the electrodes. The increase of the crosstalk with \(\eta\) can be correlated to the decrease of the resistance values. These have been measured at warm on test bench. Their spread is mainly due to te fact that we had two different suppliers with different resistances values (the part A is mainly equipped with electrodes with higher resistances than in the part B). The correlation between the test beam measurement of the crosstalk and the inverse of the test bench measurement of the resistances at warm is shown in figure 12. This correlation is clear and does explain the behaviour of the crosstalk with \(\eta\). Note that the ratio between the resistance values at warm and at cold can depend on the resistance polymerisation, which explains that the correlation is not perfect. Moreover, 2 resistances every 8 are a bit bigger for design reasons. This leads to a lower crosstalk that can be seen by looking in more details at the results, as shown in figure 13.

In conclusion, the main quantitative results are the following :

* **the mean value of the resistive crosstalk between middle cells and strips is 0.05% for the A electrode,**
* **the mean value of the resistive crosstalk between middle cells and strips is 0.16% for the B electrode,**
* **the results are well correlated to test bench measurements of the resistances, whose behaviour explains the \(\eta\) trend observed on the crosstalk.**

It can be reminded that peak-peak and t\({}_{max}\) definitions are equivalent in this case.

Figure 11: Distributions of the resistive crosstalk measurements between pulsed middle cells and strips in A electrode (left plots) and in B electrode (right plots). The middle cells belonging to the calibration lines 1 and 3 (upper plots) and 2 and 4 (lower plots) are pulsed.

### Strips to Middle cells crosstalk results

Although one can think that strip to middle cells crosstalk can be deduced from the previous results, the reverse crosstalk between these two samplings is interesting to be studied in order to check the effects of resistances with \(\eta\) in other conditions of pulses and calibrations.

A Typical shape of crosstalk signals in a middle cell when a strip in front of it is pulsed has been shown in figure 10.

During the beam tests, strips are pulsed according to the pattern shown in figure 28. Every four strip is pulsed. Consequently, two strips are pulsed simultaneously in front of one middle cell. The following results have been normalised to the case where only one strip is pulsed, by dividing the crosstalk by a factor 2.

The evolution of the crosstalk versus \(\eta\) is shown in figure 13 (all the calibration lines are included). The corresponding distributions are presented in figure 15.

As expected, the crosstalk between the strips and the middle cells is twice the crosstalk between the middle cells and the strips (in the first case, 2 strips are pulsed with 4 middle cells in front of them, and in the second case, 2 middle cells are pulsed with the 8 corresponding strips). Moreover, the same behaviour as the middle cells to strips crosstalk is observed: slopes in A and B electrodes are the same. This confirms the previous correlation of the results with the resistance values: the increase of the crosstalk with \(\eta\) is due to the resistance values which decrease with \(\eta\) in both electrodes.

Figure 15: Distributions of the resistive crosstalk measurements between one pulsed strip cell and middle cell in A electrode (left plots) and in B electrode (right plots) with peak-peak definition (upper plots) and t\({}_{max}\) definition (lower plots).

In conclusion, the main quantitative results are the following :

* **the mean value of the crosstalk between strips and middle cells is 0.15% (respectively 0.11%) for the A electrode using peak-peak definition (respectively \(\text{t}_{max}\) definition),**
* **the mean value of the crosstalk between strips and middle cells is 0.41% (respectively 0.35%) for the B electrode using peak-peak definition (respectively \(\text{t}_{max}\) definition).**Inductive crosstalk

### Signal shapes

The main source of crosstalk in the middle and back samplings (middle to middle, middle to back, back to middle and back to back) comes from the mutual inductance between the cells and from the ground return. On the contrary to what happens in the fine segmented strips (see section 2), the pure capacitive crosstalk in the electrodes themselves is in those cases negligible compared to the inductive one. Indeed, as shown in figure 16, the shapes of the crosstalk signals in the neighbour cells of the pulsed one are close to a second derivative, with a fast first peak due the inductive coupling and a second one due to the capacitive coupling.

The involved couplings occur on the electrodes themselves but also in the back mother boards. The scheme of such a board is shown in figure 29. The signals from both middle and back samplings arrive on the mother boards through the summing board connectors. In order to study the crosstalk in these later, the relevant parameter is the **channel number** in the summing board connector. It increases first with \(\Phi_{\text{middle}}\) and then with \(\eta\) (see figure 29) for middle and back cells.

The fluctuations of the crosstalk signals at \(t_{\text{max}}\) being very important (see figure 16), the peak-peak definition (section 1) will be mainly considered in this section, although it clearly gives pessimistic crosstalk values. The values obtained with the \(t_{\text{max}}\) definition will also be given, which will allow to quantify these fluctuations.

Figure 16: Typical recorded shapes of (1) the pulsed signal, (2) the crosstalk in a neighbour middle cell and (3) the crosstalk in a neighbour back cell. In (a), a middle cell is pulsed and in (b) a back cell is pulsed. The crosstalk signals are magnified by a factor 20.

### Crosstalk Measurements

We looked at the crosstalk on each of the 224 middle and 108 back cells of the \(\Phi_{\rm strip}=2\) line (i.e. \(\Phi_{\rm middle}=8\), 9, 10 and 11). This has been done for all the possible calibration patterns in the middle and in the back samplings, that are reminded in figure 27. These cells are connected on 7 mother boards via 14 summing board connectors.

The results are shown as a function of the mother board channel number in figure 17 (a) when the middle is pulsed and in figure 17 (b) when the back is pulsed. This has been obtained when the cells of the calibration line number 1 are pulsed. Note that the back sampling ends at \(\eta=1.35\), whereas the middle one ends at \(\eta=1.4\) (figure 26), which explains the zero values at the end of the lower plots. The results obtained with the three other calibration lines are similar and shown in the appendix 3 in figures 30, 31 and 32. The corresponding distributions of the crosstalk values, including the four calibration lines, are presented in figure 18. The distributions obtained with the t\({}_{\rm max}\) definitions are shown in figure 19. As expected, the crosstalk values have in this case large fluctuations (RMS \(\sim\) mean value).

It is quite easy to explain the patterns of the crosstalk values seen in figure 17 by looking at the structure of the summing board connector (figure 29). The closer are the pins corresponding to the pulsed channels, the higher the crosstalk is.

The main quantitative results are the following:

* **the mean crosstalk middle-middle is 2.3% (resp. \(\sim 0.9\)%) using the peak-peak (resp. t\({}_{\rm max}\)) definition,**
* **the mean crosstalk middle-back is 1.4% (resp. \(\sim 0.7\)%) using the peak-peak (resp. t\({}_{\rm max}\)) definition,**
* **the mean crosstalk back-middle is 1.5% (resp. \(\sim 0.5\)%) using the peak-peak (resp. t\({}_{\rm max}\)) definition,**
* **the mean crosstalk back-back is 1.8% (resp. \(\sim 0.8\)%) using the peak-peak (resp. t\({}_{\rm max}\)) definition.**

These values are quite high. It was already the case in the 98' test beam results [2]. It motivated a review of the structure of the mother board. From test bench measurements done on these new boards [4], the maximum peak-peak crosstalk is below 0.8% whereas the t\({}_{\rm max}\) crosstalk is much more stable and is at most 0.3%.

Figure 17: Inductive crosstalk measurement in the barrel back mother boards. In (a) (resp. (b)), the middle (resp. back) cells of the calibration line number 1 are pulsed. These pulsed cells are marked with a vertical line. The upper (resp. lower) plots show the crosstalk in the middle (resp. back) channel numbers. The peak-peak definition has been used.

Long distance crosstalk

Even if two cells are physically far away from each other, a so called "long distance" crosstalk can occur. For example, as the back and the front samplings are physically separated by the middle one, the crosstalk between them is very small, but does exist. The main contribution to this crosstalk can only come from a region of the data acquisition chain where the two signals are treated in a common area.

As the back and middle samplings are read out by the barrel back mother board whereas the front sampling is read out by the barrel front mother board, the two kinds of signal cannot be coupled before the feedthroughs area. There, all the cables have to be gathered to be connected to the front end boards via the pig tail connectors, vacuum cables, warm cables and cold and warm flanges [5]. This gives rise to a long distance crosstalk, that will be the only one seen in **physics data**.

Another source of crosstalk can occur in **calibration data**. Indeed, the injected charge sent by the calibration board is treated by the same card and common connectors for every channel on electrode A or electrode B (there are one calibration card for each half module (\(\Phi>0\) and \(\Phi<0\)) and two connectors per calibration board (one for each electrode)).

Here will be reported on the middle cells to strips and back cells to strips long distance crosstalk.

### Middle cells to strips long distance crosstalk

The resistive crosstalk between a pulsed middle cell and the strips in front of it has been studied in section 3. Here is investigated the crosstalk between a pulsed middle cell and the strips that are in front of its middle cell neighbour, which is not pulsed (see figure 27 for more details about the calibration patterns). There is no resistor between these cells and the coupling occurs at "long distance". Notice that we subtracted this crosstalk in section 3 in order to obtain the pure resistive one. Typical shapes has been shown in figure 9 (a).

The measured crosstalk is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in figure 20. In the upper (resp. lower) plot, the middle cells of the odd (resp. even) calibration lines are pulsed. The break at \(\eta=256\) is due to the different gain factors between the A and the B electrodes (see the upper plot of figure 2). The distribution of the crosstalk is shown in figure 21 for both parity of calibration lines. The peak-peak definition of the crosstalk has been used.

These figures exhibit a clear pattern correlated with the parity of the calibration line. It can be easily understood when looking at the structure of the calibration board connectors, schematised in figure 22. Each pin of this board is connected to a calibration line of a region \(\Delta\eta=0.2\). The odd (resp. even) calibration lines are connected to the lower (resp. upper) pins. The crosstalk in the connectors between these pins has been measured [6] on test bench. It occurs mainly through neighbours of a given line (corresponding to a given calibration parity), as schematised in figure 22. It is quite negligible for two cells with different calibration parity.

Figure 21: Distributions of the long distance crosstalk between one pulsed middle cell and the strips in front of its neighbour. In the upper (resp. lower) plot, the middle cells of the odd (resp. even) calibration lines are pulsed.

Figure 20: Long distance crosstalk between one pulsed middle cell and the strips in front of its neighbour. In the upper (resp. lower) plot, the middle cells of the odd (resp. even) calibration lines are pulsed. The full circles (resp. stars, open circles and diamonds) are for the strips connected to the calibration line number 1 (resp. 2, 3 and 4).

This feature explains the results reported in figure 20. It is also the proof that the main source of crosstalk comes from the calibration injection system. When a middle cell belonging to the calibration line number 1 is pulsed, the strips connected to the calibration line number 3 are direct neighbours on the calibration board connectors. They indeed sees the largest crosstalk of about 0.12% (open circles of the top plot of figure 20). The strips connected to the calibration line number 1 are second neighbours and sees a lower crosstalk of about 0.08% (full circles). The strips connected to the calibration line number 2 and 4 (stars and diamonds) see a very low crosstalk (\(<0.05\%\)). In this case, the crosstalk in the calibration board connectors is very small and the contribution coming from the feedthroughs is visible (about 0.02%).

When a middle cell belonging to a calibration line number 3 is pulsed, the strips connected to the calibration line number 3 (resp. 1) are now second (resp. third) neighbours on the calibration board connectors. Thus the crosstalk is lower and, for example, the open circles are at the level of the previous full circles (second neighbours), etc...

All the patterns seen in figure 20 can be easily explained. This gives rise to the multiple peaks structure of figure 21, reflecting the level of neighbourhood of the corresponding pins on the calibration board connectors.

### Back cells to strips crosstalk

In this subsection the crosstalk between a pulsed back cell and the corresponding strips is investigated. As the hardware is exactly the same than for the long distance crosstalk between the middle cells and the strips, the same behaviour is expected. The measured crosstalk is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in figure 23. In the upper (resp. lower) plot, the middle cells of the odd (resp. even) calibration lines are pulsed. The distribution of the crosstalk is shown in figure 24 for both parity of calibration lines. The peak-peak definition of the crosstalk has been used. Note that only few runs have been taken for \(\eta_{\rm strip}<128\).

Figure 22: Sketch of the calibration board output connector. The numbers refer to the calibration line number the pin is connected with for a region \(\Delta\eta=0.2\). The arrows represent the level of crosstalk between one pin and its neighbours.

Figure 23: Long distance crosstalk between one pulsed back cell and the strips in front of it. In the upper (resp. lower) plot, the back cells of the odd (resp. even) calibration lines are pulsed. The full circles (resp. stars, open circles and diamonds) are for the strips connected to the calibration line number 1 (resp. 2, 3 and 4).

Figure 24: Distributions of the long distance crosstalk between one pulsed back cell and the strips in front of it. In the upper (resp. lower) plot, the back cells of the odd (resp. even) calibration lines are pulsed.

As expected, the behaviour is the same than in the previous subsection, and all the explanations given there are still available. The only particularity comes here from the two regions where the crosstalk is constant (i.e. independent of the calibration parity) and very low (around 0.02%). Again, this is easily explained by looking at the calibration board connectors (see figure 22). The first strip pins on the connectors do not have any neighbour back pins. Thus no coupling occurs there and the crosstalk comes only from the feedthroughs. It is the case at the beginning of each connector, i.e. at the beginning of each electrode. It concerns the first \(\Delta\eta=0.2\) region of each electrode, i.e. 64 strips. This is fully visible for the B electrode (\(257\leq\eta_{\,\rm strip}\leq 320\)) and can also be seen in spite of the lack of runs for the A electrode (\(1\leq\eta_{\,\rm strip}\leq 64\)).

Conclusion

This note sums up an extensive review of the different crosstalks occurring in the EM Barrel Module 0 tested at CERN in August 1999.

Tables 1 and 2 sum up all the different crosstalks seen in the different samplings of the barrel calorimeter when respectively evaluating the crosstalk with the peak-peak definition or the t\({}_{max}\) one. These results are presented graphically in figure 25.

Several important points pop up from the study presented here:

* For each sampling, the main crosstalk source has been identified and measured. Moreover, each contribution have been connected to a hardware feature, either on the electrodes or on the electronic boards.
* Every singular problem found in the analysis have been interpreted in relation with hardware features (short cuts, details of a connector,... ).
* The test beam data are in exact agreement with the electrodes defaults as measured with the electrical test benches [3]. This confirms the good quality of the test bench measurements. For the different cells which are in short cut, a modification of the gain which transforms ADC counts to GeV will have to be implemented in EMTB to study physics runs.
