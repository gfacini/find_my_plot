[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]

## 1 Introduction

The identification of jets containing \(b\)-hadrons (\(b\)-jets), \(c\)-hadrons (\(c\)-jets), or neither \(b\)- or \(c\)-hadrons (light-flavour jets), is an important component of the physics programme of the ATLAS experiment [1] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [2]. This effort is needed for a number of physics analyses within ATLAS: precision measurements of Standard Model (SM) processes; measurements of Higgs boson decays to pairs of bottom quarks, charm quarks, and in association with top quark pairs; and searches for new physics beyond the SM. In particular, analyses that benefit from the smoothing of \(b\)-tagging efficiency SFs include the search for the Higgs boson decay into two \(b\)-jets [3] and a search for new resonances in the mass distributions of \(b\)-jet pairs [4].

To this end, the ATLAS Collaboration has developed a number of algorithms to identify \(b\)-jets [5, 6], known as \(b\)-tagging algorithms, in the collision data from Run 2 of the LHC (2015-2018). These algorithms exploit various properties of \(b\)-hadrons, including their long lifetime, high mass, and the high charged-track multiplicity of their decays. The probability that a \(b\)-tagging algorithm correctly identifies a \(b\)-jet is called the \(b\)-tagging efficiency, \(\epsilon_{b}\). In addition, \(b\)-taggers can also mistakenly identify \(c\)- or light-flavour jets as a \(b\)-jet and is called the mistag rate. The probability for this to occur is \(\epsilon_{c}\) and \(\epsilon_{l}\) for \(c\)- and light-flavour jets, respectively. These parameters, \(\epsilon_{b}\), \(\epsilon_{c}\) and \(\epsilon_{l}\), quantify the performance of a \(b\)-tagging algorithm.

In order to quantify limitations in the modelling of the detector and the description of the underlying physics processes in the Monte Carlo (MC) simulation, the performance of a \(b\)-tagging algorithm is evaluated in simulation and measured in the collision data by dedicated analyses that use data samples enriched in either \(b\)-, \(c\)-, or light-flavour jets [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The output of a \(b\)-tagging algorithm consists of a per-jet weight that quantifies the probability that the jet is a \(b\)-jet, and has discriminating power between \(b\), \(c\), and light-flavour jets. The evaluation of the performance of a \(b\)-tagging algorithm is carried out by using \(b\)-jet tagging single-cut operating points (OPs). These are based on a fixed selection requirement on the output distribution of a \(b\)-tagging algorithm such that a given \(b\)-tagging efficiency, \(\epsilon_{b}\), is evaluated for the \(b\)-jets present in simulated top quark pair events. Four single-cut OPs are currently defined, at 60%, 70%, 77%, and 85%. Simulation-to-data scale factors (SFs) are derived as a function of the jet transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) for each OP as the ratio of the measured \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency evaluated from the simulation. The SFs are then applied in physics analyses as a per-jet weight to jets in simulation.

Before \(b\)-tagging efficiency SFs are incorporated into physics analyses, the nominal value and the systematic uncertainties are smoothed with a non-parametric regression technique. Smoothing is applied since the application of non-continuous SFs in analyses may result in the distortion of the shapes of kinematic variables. This would be undesirable, for example, in analyses searching for resonances in mass distributions [4], since the background is fitted with a smoothly falling function. The justification for smoothing is that it is assumed that \(b\)-tagging efficiency SFs are smoothly varying functions of jet kinematics. This derives from the assumption that limitations in the detector modelling and description of underlying physics processes in MC is not discontinuous as a function of the jet kinematics. Lastly, as more data becomes available, and SFs are derived in more extreme regions of the phase space, it will become important to combine smoothed SF distributions from different analyses that may or may not overlap in the phase space. This necessitates that any discontinuities resulting from large statistical fluctuations, particularly in extreme regions of the phase space, are removed.

A histogram with much finer binning than the original SF measurements is obtained after application of the smoothing, and it is the smoothed SF distribution, and not the original binned SF measurements,that are applied in physics analyses to the jets in simulation. The smoothing method implemented in this note is local polynomial kernel regression [11], which is a type of non-parametric regression. This particular method gives a general prescription for constructing a smoothed distribution from the binned SF measurements in a way which follows trends in the data and removes discontinuities between bins. The smoothness of the SF distribution obtained after applying this method is determined by a parameter referred to as the bandwidth, and is a quantity which one may adjust arbitrarily. This note presents a description of the smoothing method implemented to smooth \(b\)-tagging efficiency and mistag rate SFs, as well as the optimisation of the bandwidth parameter. The optimal smoothing parameter and smoothed SFs shown in this note correspond to jets reconstructed with the Particle Flow jet reconstruction algorithm [12]. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency and mistag rate SFs are derived from jets identified by the DL1 \(b\)-tagging algorithm [6]. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency and mistag rate SFs used in this note are found in Ref. [13] for the 70% efficient single-cut OP.

This note is organised as follows. In Section 2, the local polynomial kernel regression method is described. Section 3 outlines the optimisation procedure of the bandwidth parameter. The smoothed SF distributions obtained with the optimal bandwidth parameter for \(b\)-tagging efficiency and mistag rate SFs are also shown. Conclusions are provided in Section 4.

## 2 Non-parametric regression

The number of bins of the current baseline SF measurements and their \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges are presented in Table 1. Since the SF measurements are assumed to be smoothly varying as a function of the jet kinematics, it is desirable to transform the SFs into a continuous distribution and smooth discontinuities at the bin boundaries. The method described in this note, currently in use in the ATLAS Collaboration, is that of local polynomial kernel regression.

### Local polynomial kernel regression

The description of local polynomial kernel regression follows the treatment in [11], [14], and [15]. Starting with \(n\) data points \((X_{1},Y_{1}),\ \ldots,(X_{n},Y_{n})\), where \(X_{i}\) are the covariates and \(Y_{i}\) are the responses (with uncertainties), the goal of any regression analysis is to estimate a function that models the relationship between the \(X_{i}\) and \(Y_{i}\). In this note, \(X_{i}\) and \(Y_{i}\) correspond to the geometric bin centres1 of the SFs binned in jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), and the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and mistag rate SFs, respectively. Typically in linear regression one would select a model and use a particular method (e.g. ordinary least squares minimisation) to estimate the parameters of the model. For example, if \(m(x)\) is the regression function, it should match the conditional expectation at \(X_{i}=x\):

Footnote 1: In Ref. [6], the smoothing is applied using data points located at the mean jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of each bin, rather than the geometric bin centre. The difference between the mean jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of each bin and the geometric bin centres is negligible for the results presented in this note using the binning in Table 1.

\[m(X_{i})=\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}|X_{i}=x]. \tag{1}\]

The goal of kernel regression is to estimate the function \(m(x)\) at \(X_{i}=x\) without specifying what the function should be. This can be done by using a local polynomial approximation of the function \(m(x)\) in a region around \(X_{i}\), for example. It is assumed that the regression function is continuous, so one can make use of a Taylor expansion around \(X_{i}=x\) to find a \(p^{\rm th}\)-order polynomial,

\[m(X_{i})=\sum_{j=0}^{P}(X_{i}-x)^{j}\beta_{j}(x)+R, \tag{2}\]

where \(R\) represents higher-order terms and

\[\beta_{j}(x)=\frac{m^{(j)}(x)}{j!},\ j=0,1,\ldots,p, \tag{3}\]

where \(m^{(j)}(x)\) is the \(j^{\rm th}\) derivative of \(m(X_{i})\) at \(x\). One may then take Equation 2 as the statistical model and estimate the regression coefficients, \(\beta_{j}(x)\), in the region where \(x\) is sufficiently close to \(X_{i}\). The estimate can be performed by minimising the weighted sum of squares

\[\sum_{i=1}^{n}K_{h}(X_{i}-x)[Y_{i}-\beta_{0}(x)-\cdots-\beta_{p}(x)(X_{i}-x)^{ p}]^{2}, \tag{4}\]

\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline Flavour & Number of bins & \(p_{\rm T}\) range [GeV] \\ \hline \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency & 9 & \(20-30\) \\  & & \(30-40\) \\  & & \(40-60\) \\  & & \(60-85\) \\  & & \(85-110\) \\  & & \(110-140\) \\  & & \(140-175\) \\  & & \(175-250\) \\  & & \(250-400\) \\ \hline Charm mistag rate & 4 & \(20-40\) \\  & & \(40-65\) \\  & & \(65-140\) \\  & & \(140-250\) \\ \hline Light-flavour mistag rate & 4 & \(20-50\) \\  & & \(50-100\) \\  & & \(100-150\) \\  & & \(150-300\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Equation 4 shows that the estimate of the regression function is a product of two components: the kernel function, with a particular degree of smoothness as defined by the bandwidth; and a stochastic component (the data). The choice of kernel function and bandwidth value are important considerations in kernel smoothing since, ultimately, the smoothness of the resulting estimate of the regression function is dictated by the smoothness properties of the kernel function. The subject of bandwidth selection is discussed in Section 3. The kernel function used in this implementation is outlined in Section 2.2. A detailed discussion about other choices of kernel function and their properties is outside the scope of this note, with details available in Refs. [11] and [15]. For fixed \(x\), Equation 4 is minimised with respect to each \(\beta\). By definition, estimates of each \(\beta\) give estimates of the regression function, \(\hat{m}(x)\), and its derivatives. An important point is that although a polynomial of order \(p\) is fitted to the data in the region around \(X_{i}\), it is only used to evaluate the fit at a single point \(x\). It is useful to introduce particular notation to outline the method: \(\mathbf{Y}=(Y_{1},\ldots,Y_{n})^{T}\) is a vector of responses,

\[\mathbf{X}(x)=\begin{bmatrix}1&X_{1}-x&\ldots&(X_{1}-x)^{p}\\ \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\ 1&X_{n}-x&\ldots&(X_{n}-x)^{p}\end{bmatrix}, \tag{5}\]

is a design matrix of size \(n\times(p+1)\), and \(\mathbf{W}(x)=\text{diag}[K_{h}(X_{1}-x),\ldots,K_{h}(X_{n}-x)]\) is a diagonal weight matrix of size \(n\times n\). In addition, we define a vector of the regression "coefficients",

\[\boldsymbol{\beta}(x)=(\beta_{0}(x),\ldots,\beta_{p}(x))^{T}, \tag{6}\]

which is implicitly a vector of the \(j^{\text{th}}\) derivatives of \(m(x)\), as in Equation 3. Equation 4 may then be restated as

\[(\boldsymbol{Y}-\boldsymbol{X}(x)\boldsymbol{\beta}(x))^{T}\boldsymbol{W}(x)( \boldsymbol{Y}-\boldsymbol{X}(x)\boldsymbol{\beta}(x)). \tag{7}\]

Minimising Equation 7 with respect to \(\boldsymbol{\beta}(x)\) for fixed x leads to the solution

\[\hat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}(x)=(\boldsymbol{X}^{T}(x)\boldsymbol{W}(x) \boldsymbol{X}(x))^{-1}\boldsymbol{X}^{T}(x)\boldsymbol{W}(x)\boldsymbol{Y} \tag{8}\]

where \((\boldsymbol{X}^{T}(x)\boldsymbol{W}(x)\boldsymbol{X}(x))^{-1}\) is assumed to be invertible. The estimate of the regression function, \(\hat{m}(x)\), is the intercept coefficient, \(\hat{\beta}_{0}(x)\), so

\[\hat{m}(x;p,h)=e_{1}^{T}(\boldsymbol{X}^{T}(x)\boldsymbol{W}(x) \boldsymbol{X}(x))^{-1}\boldsymbol{X}^{T}(x)\boldsymbol{W}(x)\boldsymbol{Y}, \tag{9}\]

where \(e_{1}\) is a vector of \((p+1)\) rows with one in the first entry and zero elsewhere. The notation \(\hat{m}(x;p,h)\) is to clarify that the estimate of the regression function not only depends on \(x\), but also on the order of the polynomial that is fitted locally and the value of the bandwidth parameter in the kernel function. Equation 9 shows explicitly that the estimated regression function, \(\hat{m}(x;p,h)\), is linear in the response variable, \(\boldsymbol{Y}\) (the vector of discrete measured SFs for each \(X_{i}\)). This is an important point that is relevant in Section 3.1. The method derived in this Section, as has been shown, can be generalised to fit any \(p^{\text{th}}\) order polynomial, but can also be generalised to covariates of higher dimension.

### Implementation in ATLAS

The specific implementation for smoothing the \(b\)-tagging efficiency SFs uses a first-order polynomial for the Taylor expansion in Equation 2, and a Gaussian function for the kernel. The bandwidth in this case corresponds to the width of the Gaussian kernel function. It is ultimately due to the continuous nature of the Gaussian function that the resulting SF distribution is smooth and continuous. The Gaussian kernel is chosen since it is one of the simplest and has a number of important properties that a kernel function must satisfy, including that it is symmetric, unimodal, and integrates to unity [11]. A local first order polynomial fit is chosen since it has been shown to perform better at the edges of a distribution than using a polynomial of even order [11; 14].

In practice, the dimension along which the SF measurements are smoothed (jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) is transformed into a logarithmic scale. The SFs are smoothed along the transformed axis, and then translated back to the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The benefit of this approach is that the bandwidth parameter behaves in approximately the same way for each bin over the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range. Whilst the bandwidth must have units of \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) in order to have a dimensionless kernel function, the bandwidth is typically presented as dimensionless in the following. In addition, the inverse covariance matrix of the SF measurements is incorporated into the weight matrix. In this way, the weight matrix mimics the inverse of the covariance matrix which is used in ordinary least squares fitting. This makes it clear that in the case where kernel evaluations are replaced with unity (which occurs in the large bandwidth limit), the method reduces to a global least squares fit [16]. Systematic uncertainties associated with each SF bin are propagated to the smoothed SF distribution by separately smoothing variations with respect to the nominal values of the binned SF measurements, and adding the resulting smoothed histograms in quadrature. This takes into account correlations between systematic uncertainties.

## 3 Bandwidth optimisation

The bandwidth, \(h\), is a parameter that may be arbitrarily chosen to adjust the degree to which a particular distribution of data is smoothed. The choice of bandwidth is important since, in choosing a particular value, one is implicitly making a statement about the nature of the mismodelling of the detector and description of the underlying physics processes in the simulation. If too small a bandwidth is chosen, corresponding to a narrow Gaussian window, the local linear fitting at \(x\) is sensitive to data close to it but not to data far from it, resulting in an under-smooth estimate. Conversely, too large a bandwidth implies that data points are weighted equally. As the bandwidth tends to infinity, kernel evaluations tend to unity and the method reduces to a global least squares fit to the data [11; 14]. The effect of choosing two distinct bandwidth values is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows the \(b\)-tagging efficiency SF for \(b\)-jets at the 70% OP smoothed with bandwidths of 0.2 and 0.6. It can be seen that a bandwidth of 0.2 interpolates the data and that large, nonphysical variations in the smoothed SF distribution are present. The value of 0.6 is shown for comparison since this is the particular bandwidth value that is determined to be optimal in Section 3.2. The comparison of the two smoothed curves in Figure 1 shows that the smoothed estimates obtained from using distinct bandwidths can differ significantly, and that developing an optimisation for the bandwidth is necessary.

To further emphasise that the choice of bandwidth is important, the nominal smoothed value and relative uncertainty are shown in Fig. 2(a) and 2(b), respectively, for bandwidth values of 0.2, 0.6, and 2.0. The bandwidth values chosen are to illustrate two extreme cases of under-smoothing and over-smoothing, as well as smoothing with the optimal bandwidth that is obtained in Section 3.2. It can be seen that the difference between each smoothed curve is negligible in the bulk of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum in Figure 2(a), whilst the differences are approximately \(5-10\%\) in the upper and lower extremes of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range. Similarly, the differences in the uncertainty in each smoothed estimate are approximately \(1-2\%\) in the bulk of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum, with differences of up to \(15\%\) in the upper and lower extremes of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range.

With the availability of more data, SFs are derived in more extreme regions of the phase space in new analyses. The combination of these different analyses, which may or may not overlap in the phase space, will become an important consideration. Whilst a discussion of combining multiple analyses into the smoothing process is outside the scope of this note, it is clear that the bandwidth should be optimised such that the smoothed result is sufficiently smooth (i.e. large, seemingly nonphysical variations are not present) in the upper and lower regions of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum.

In order to find an optimal value for the bandwidth, a method is developed based on minimising _Stein's

Figure 1: \(b\)-tagging efficiency SFs for b-jets at the 70% OP. The smoothed curves are obtained using bandwidth values of 0.2 and 0.6, whilst the data is shown by the black points. The risk, as defined in Equation 10, is shown on the figure for both smoothed curves.

Figure 2: The nominal smoothed curves obtained with bandwidth values of 0.2, 0.6, and 2.0 are shown in (a). The corresponding relative uncertainties are shown for each smoothed curve in (b). The risk, as defined in Equation 10, is shown on each figure for the three smoothed curves.

unbiased risk estimator_, hereafter known as the risk [17]. The risk is defined as

\[\widehat{\operatorname{Err}}(h)=\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}-\hat{m}(X_{i};p,h)]^{2}+2 \hat{\operatorname{df}}(h), \tag{10}\]

where \(\mathbb{E}[Y_{i}-\hat{m}(X_{i};p,h)]^{2}\) is the mean squared error between the data points and the estimate of the regression function at the data points, and \(\hat{\operatorname{df}}(h)\) is the estimate of the effective degrees of freedom. The addition of the effective degrees of freedom in Equation 10 avoids selecting the bandwidth that simply interpolates the SF measurements. Instead, the bandwidth obtained by minimising the risk represents a compromise between minimising the mean squared error and minimising the sensitivity of the fit to data fluctuations.

### Calculating the effective degrees of freedom

In ordinary least squares minimisation, the degrees of freedom in the fit is the number of data points minus the number of fitted parameters. This is not necessarily the case for non-parametric smoothing methods. In general however, a non-parametric smoothing method is linear in the response variable and may be written as

\[\hat{\mathbf{m}}(X_{i};p,h)=\mathbf{S}(X_{i};h)\mathbf{Y}, \tag{11}\]

where \(\hat{\mathbf{m}}(X_{i};p,h)\) is a vector of the smoothed predictions at \(X_{i}\), \(\mathbf{Y}\) is a vector of the discrete response variables, and \(\mathbf{S}(X_{i};h)\) is a smoothing matrix which transforms the discrete response variables into a smoothed continuous function. The smoothing matrix, \(\boldsymbol{S}(X_{i};h)\), has rank equal to \(n\). By definition, the trace, \(\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{S}(X_{i};h))\), is the dimension of the projection space, or the number of basis functions [15]. This implies that this quantity gives the number of parameters in the fit, and so the effective number of degrees of freedom for a smoothing method is

\[\hat{\operatorname{df}}(h)=\operatorname{tr}(\mathbf{S}(X_{i};h)). \tag{12}\]

The formula for the effective degrees of freedom in Equation 12 is true in the case where the data are statistically uncorrelated. This is not the case for the \(b\)-tagging efficiency SFs. In the case of \(b\)-tagging efficiency measurements, a sample of events is selected by requiring more than one reconstructed jet per event and these selected jets may be in different jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins. This means that the statistical uncertainty on the \(b\)-tagging efficiency measurement in jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin \(i\) has a nonzero correlation with the measurement in jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin \(j\). In order to correctly determine the effective degrees of freedom, the statistical covariance matrix is reconstructed from the original measurement of the \(b\)-tagging efficiencies. The eigenvectors of the statistical covariance matrix are found and are used to translate the smoothing matrix \(\boldsymbol{S}\) in Equation 11 into the orthogonal basis. The trace is taken in this basis. This method correctly takes into account the statistical correlations between \(b\)-tagging efficiency measurements in different bins of jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

### \(b\)-jets

The risk, as defined in Equation 10, is calculated as a function of the bandwidth in the range \([0.4,2.0]\) for the \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency scale factor for \(b\)-jets at all four OPs. This is shown in Figure 3. The minima of the risk distributions in Figure 3 are found to be at bandwidths of 0.55, 0.60, 0.53, and 0.54 for the 60%, 70%, 77%, and 85% operating points, respectively. The optimal bandwidth for \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency SFs is then defined as the average of the minimum risk values for the four operating points, rounded to the nearest significant digit. This is justified by the broad widths of the minima of the risk distributions in Figure 3. The result is an optimal bandwidth of 0.6. The \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency SFs for \(b\)-jets, smoothed with a bandwidth of 0.6, are shown in Figure 4 for each operating point.

The smoothed SF distributions in Figures 4(a)- 4(d) follow the trend of the data well. The uncertainty on the smoothed distribution ranges from \(1-2\%\) in the bulk of the distribution and \(5-7\%\) in the lowest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region, with a maximum discrepancy of approximately one standard deviation difference between the smoothed estimate and the data observed in the first bin. The uncertainty band on the smoothed distribution is derived from the quadrature sum of the smoothed distributions obtained after the nominal result is varied by the value of each systematic uncertainty and smoothed.

### \(c\)- and light-flavour jets

For \(c\)- and light-flavour jets, the mistag rate SFs are subject to larger systematic uncertainties than for \(b\)-tagging efficiency SFs, and fewer \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins are used to measure SFs due to the low mistag rates. Therefore, it is assumed that a precise tuning of the bandwidth parameter is not necessary. Thus, the bandwidth value obtained from the optimisation for \(b\)-jets in Section 3 is applied to \(c\)- and light-flavour jets. Eventually, with future data and additional bins, it will be beneficial to determine separate bandwidths for \(c\)- and light-flavour jet SFs. The mistag rate SFs for \(c\)- and light-flavour jets, smoothed with a bandwidth of 0.6, are shown in Figures 5 and 6 for each operating point.

For \(c\)-jets, the smoothed SF distributions in Figures 5(a)- 5(d) follow the trend of the data well and are adequately smooth. The uncertainty on the smoothed distribution typically ranges from \(10-15\%\) across the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum for each operating point, with a maximum discrepancy of approximately one standard deviation observed between the smoothed estimate and the data in the third bin of the 60% OP and the fourth bin in the 77% OP. Similarly, for light-flavour jets, the smoothed SF distributions in Figures 6(a)- 6(d) show an adequate level of smoothing that sufficiently covers the uncertainty on the SF measurements. The

uncertainty on the smoothed distribution is typically between \(20-30\%\) across the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum for each OP.

The smoothed distribution and its uncertainty band are overlaid. It should be noted that the total uncertainty on the SFs is dominated by systematic uncertainties, since the bin-to-bin variation is smaller than the total uncertainty.

## 4 Conclusion

The optimisation of the smoothing of \(b\)-tagging efficiency and mistag rate SFs has been presented and applied to the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and mistag rate SFs for jets reconstructed with the Particle Flow jet algorithm and identified by the DL1 \(b\)-tagging algorithm. Simulation-to-data SFs are derived in bins of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) in order to quantify limitations in the modelling of the detector and the description of the underlying physics processes. Since it is assumed that SFs are smoothly varying functions of the jet kinematics, the SF measurements are smoothed to remove discontinuities between bins. The method of local polynomial kernel regression is applied to the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and mistag rate SFs. The bandwidth, corresponding to the width of the Gaussian kernel function, is optimised with a method based on minimising Stein's unbiased risk estimator. For \(b\)-jet SFs, a bandwidth value of 0.6 is derived and is shown to be consistent across the set of OPs. For \(c\)- and light-flavour jet SFs, the same bandwidth value is used. In all cases, the resulting smoothed SF distributions are shown to follow trends in the data well and are sufficiently smooth across the range of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum.
