The planned number of modules per disk lends itself well to a sectorised geometry, at least in terms of the services. Figure 2 shows a quarter of a disk with division into 1/12-disk sectors (i.e. 3 sectors are shown, roughly outlined in black, red and green) The upper left and lower right sectors in this sketch illustrate two possible cooling-pipe paths (shown in pale blue). It may or may not be practical to build the disks themselves in such sectors; this will be studied in FEA and prototypes. It will in any case be necessary to construct the disks in sections at most as large as half-disks, to allow the disks to be assembled around the LHC beampipe.

Figure 1: A possible layout of modules on a pixel disk. This particular disk has two rings of ‘quad’ modules (modules built on four FE14 readout ASICs) and one ring of ‘hex’ modules (modules built on six FE14s).

Figure 2: One quarter of a disk showing division into three service sectors.

Alternate layouts could possibly provide both phi and radial overlaps by, for example, placing all modules in a given ring on the same side of the disk, with phi overlap provided by raising alternate modules, see Figure 3.

The leftmost drawing in Figure 3 shows the front side of a disk sector, with one module lifted off the surface, to show one of the pedestals in the disk structure that would raise the upper modules to achieve the overlap. The centre drawing shows the other side of the sector, and the rightmost drawing shows a possible cooling pipe path within the foam. Note that the extension of the cooling pipe beyond the outer radius of the disk shown in these drawings is arbitrary; in a realistic design the 90-degree bend would be much nearer the disk, to minimise the space required between detectors for the passage of services; bends of less than 1cm radius are expected to be achievable.

Advantages and disadvantages to such a scheme are briefly addressed in Section 2 of this document.

## 2 Disk Structure and Assembly Procedure

Disks will be made of a carbon-foam core with embedded cooling pipe and power and data cables, with carbon-fibre skins glued to each side. Similar structures with linear rather than annular-ring geometry have been prototyped and tested for the pixel barrel detector project (see Figure 4).

The core of the structure (shown in pale green in Figure 4) is a high-thermal-conductivity carbon foam. The foam is cut into slabs that are slightly more than half the desired thickness of the finished disk. One side of each foam slab

is machined to the desired profile (either flat as in the default layout described in Section 1.1, or with 'pillars' as in the alternate layout) and glued to a carbon-fibre facesheet, which gives the disk its structural integrity. The other side of the carbon foam is then ground flat, and subsequently machined to accept a titanium cooling pipe and copper-kapton power and data transmission ('bus') tapes (shown in orange in Figure 4). Pipes and tapes are then glued in place and the two halves of the'sandwich' are glued together. Extensions from the embedded bus tapes wrap around to connect to the modules, which are glued to both surfaces.

This 'embedded tape' scheme would lend itself very well to a two-ring disk, whereby curved bus tapes embedded at the outer radius of the disk would serve the outer ring of modules and similar tapes at the inner radius would serve the inner ring. Getting power and signals to a middle ring presents a challenge; a possible solution would be to embed bus tapes for the middle ring between the foam and the carbon fibre skin, passing extensions through openings in the carbon fibre to connect to the modules; the feasibility of this scheme would need to be studied in prototype.

Finding space on the surface of the disk for an EoS card is another potentially difficult task. An advantage to a disk constructed of separate sectors, as described in Section 1.1, would be that staggering adjacent sectors' z-positions slightly would enable the addition of some empty disk surface at the sector edges (see the outlines in red and green in Figure 2), although this would add inactive material to the design. Another possibility may be to locate these cards off-disk although the electrical implications of this would need careful study.

The alternate ('stepped') module layout mentioned in Section 1.1 (see Figure 3) would make bus tapes easier to route and EoS cards easier to place as much more surface area of the disk is available, and would also increase flexibility in radial coverage and definition of service spaces. However it may present cooling difficulties as the contact surface area between the cooled disk and the upper modules would be significantly reduced. Disks with the necessary 'pedestals' also may be more difficult to construct. The options must be studied in FEA and prototype.

## 3 Prototyping

A small rectangular foam and carbon-fibre test structure (see Figure 5 and Figure 6) with an embedded titanium cooling pipe has been fabricated and thermally tested.

The test structure has been measured thermally with biphase CO\({}_{2}\) cooling at -33\({}^{\circ}\)C. Longitudinal and transverse temperature profiles are shown in Figure 7.

These thermal measurements have been reproduced in Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Figure 8 shows the results of a preliminary 2D simulation using the FlexPDE package, showing good agreement between data and simulation.

A more thorough 3D study was subsequently done with ANSYS (see Figure 9) to investigate the effect of the glue between the cooling pipe and the carbon foam. As shown in Figure 10, the results of this simulation indicate that most of the glue has been absorbed into the carbon foam.

Further FEA studies of this test structure, with modules added to the surface, suggest that the cooling capacity of such a structure is excellent, allowing sufficient headroom to prevent thermal runaway. This is encouraging as it suggests that a stepped geometry, with its associated decreased contact area between upper modules and the disk surface, may indeed be thermally possible. It also suggests that it may be possible to use less carbon foam, or a foam of lower density, in the construction, thereby decreasing the material budget of the detector.

## 4 Plans

A small single-ring half-disk (see Figure 11) is currently being constructed and is scheduled for completion in the first half of 2013. During 2013/14 further prototypes will be constructed and studied before proceeding with construction and testing of a full-size multi-ring half disk. In addition, further small-scale prototypes (not necessarily disk-shaped) will be constructed and studied to compare different construction techniques and their effects on thermal performance. For example various glue application techniques will be tried, and the use of thinner carbon-fibre skins, which have been used to date in the construction of existing strip and pixel-stave support structures, will be experimented with, as will construction of stepped-geometry structures if FEA predictions are favourable.

The thermal and mechanical performance of these prototype disk structures will be studied with and without thermally accurate dummy modules loaded on the surfaces, and comparisons made to FEA models, including simulations of thermal runaway conditions. The dummy modules will ensure that heat distributions are understood and sufficiently low temperatures are maintained. Measurements will be performed to determine the degree to which disk structures deform under thermal and mechanical stresses, and disks will be populated with a number of electrical modules for preliminary system tests.

Endcap variants of cooling pipes, bus tapes and end-of-stave cards will need to be prototyped and tested, as will disk support structures. Electrical grounding and shielding schemes will also be implemented and tested.
