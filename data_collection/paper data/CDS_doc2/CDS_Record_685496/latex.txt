Introduction

The Semiconductor Tracker [1] (SCT) is one of the ATLAS Inner Detector elements which aim to track charged particles in the ATLAS experiment. It consists of four cylindrical layers (barrels) of silicon strip detectors, with nine disks in each of the forward and backward directions, permitting charged particle tracking up to a pseudo-rapidity of +/-2.5. Carbon fiber structures will support a total of 4088 modules, which are the basic functional sub-unit of the SCT. Each module consists of single sided silicon micro-strip detectors glued back to back with a 40 mrad stereo-angle, and attached to a hybrid, which is a copper/polyimide flexible circuit laminated onto a carbon-carbon substrate, and supports the read-out ASIC chips. Both the detectors and the hybrid will be cooled during operation.

The detectors are \(\approx 285\mu\)m thick capacitively-coupled silicon sensors, with substrate and design differences between manufacturers [2]. They have read-out on every implanted strip and a pitch varying between about \(60\mu m\) and \(90\mu m\) for the end-cap modules.

A fully assembled hybrid consists of a six layer copper-polyimide flex circuit, a substrate, SMD components (connectors, resistors, capacitors, a thermistor), twelve ABCD3T read-out chips [3], one DORIC and one VDC chip for the optical links. The ABCD3T is the final design of the single chip implementation of binary read out architecture, realized in the radiation-hard DMILL technology. It includes in a single chip all the blocks of the binary read-out architecture: the front end circuit, discriminator, binary pipeline, derandomizing buffer, data compression logic and the read-out control logic. The design and performance of these chips are mostly detailed in [3, 4, 5, 6].

The SCT end-cap will be constructed with carbon-fiber disks covered by three kinds of modules - inner, middle and outer. Those types differ in the silicon detector dimensions. Outer and middle modules have an active strip length of 121.1 mm and 116.7 mm respectively while inner modules are formed with a single wafer of 61.06 mm length. The same hybrid is used for all three module types.

Eighteen end-cap module prototypes using the K5 hybrid version [7] have been assembled between February and November 2002 in several institutes of the SCT collaboration. Inner, middle and outer modules have been built and extensively tested electrically and thermally [8]. In this document, we will focus on the electrical performance of these K5 modules. The basic electrical requirements for SCT end-cap modules will be reported in the first section, followed by a description of the electrical test set up and a summary of the results obtained with the prototype modules. Some of the end-cap modules have been irradiated between May and October 2002 with the CERN PS 24 GeV proton beam, using the SCT T7 facility [9]: details on the tests performed will be presented.

## 2 Standard electrical module tests

### Electrical requirements for the ATLAS-SCT end-cap module

LHC operating conditions result in very challenging performance specifications for the SCT modules and the limitations mainly concern the accepted noise and noise occupancy level, the tracking efficiency, the timing and the power consumption. The complete end-cap module electrical specifications are described in [1] and only the most important ones are reported here.
* **Noise performance**. The total effective noise of the modules results from two principal contributions, the front-end electronics and the channel-to-channel threshold matching. The former is the equivalent noise charge (e\({}^{-}\) ENC) for the front-end system (including the silicon strip detector parameters). It is specified to be less than 1500 e\({}^{-}\) ENC before irradiation and 1800 e\({}^{-}\) ENC after an irradiation of 3\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) 24 GeV protons per cm\({}^{2}\). This noise hit rate needs to be significantly less than the real signal hit occupancy, to ensure that it does not affect the data trasmission rate, pattern recognition or track reconstruction. The foreseen limit value of 5\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) requires the strip discriminator level in the front-end electronics to be set to 3.3 times the rms noise. To achieve this condition at the ATLAS operating threshold of 1 fC, the total equivalent noise charge should never be greater than 1900 e\({}^{-}\) ENC: assuming 3.3 fC median charge per strip, that corresponds to a median signal-to-noise 1 ratio of 10:1. Footnote 1: The S/N ratio mentioned here concerns the median charge as signal, contrary to another often quoted quantity that is the most probable signal; it corresponds to the peak value of the energy deposition distribution.
* **Tracking efficiency**. In general the tracking efficiency of particle detectors is studied in test beams. Nevertheless, a starting requirement is a low number of dead readout channels, specified to be less than 7 for each module side to assure at least 99% of working channels.
* **Timing**. For a correct tracking reconstruction, every hit has to be associated to specific bunch crossing. That translates to a requirement on the timewalk of less than 16 ns, where the timewalk is defined as the maximum time variation in the crossing of the comparator threshold at 1 fC over a signal range of 1.25 to 10 fC. The fraction of output signals shifted to the wrong beam crossing is required to be less than 1%.
* **Power consumption[10]**. The nominal values for the power supplies of the ASICs are:
* analogue power supply: Vcc = 3.5 V \(\pm\) 5%;
* digital power supply: Vdd = 4.0 V \(\pm\) 5%;
* detector bias HV, up to 500 V with a maximal leakage current of 2\(\mu A\) per channel, that is an maximum "average" of about 3 mA. The nominal power consumption for the chips is foreseen to be 4.75 W during operation at 1 fC comparator threshold with 1% occupancy and 100 Khz trigger rate (L1 rate). Including the optical readout, the maximal power dissipation should be 7.0 W for the hybrid and the heat generated in the detectors just before run away should be 2.6 W for outer module wafers and 1.6 W for inner ones 2[11]. Footnote 2: This does not take into account the HV supply, which may limit the power to lower values.
* **Double pulse resolution[12]**. The double pulse resolution directly affects the efficiency. It is required to be 50 ns, to ensure less than 1% data loss at the highest design occupancy.

### Set-up description and characterization tests

Standard electrical tests aim to verify the hybrid and detector functionality after the module assembly and to demonstrate the module performance with respect to the required electrical specifications.

The system used to perform electrical tests and data acquisition includes the following VME units (see figure 1):

* a Multi-channel Semiconductor Tracker ABCD Readout device (MuSTARD[13]) to receive, store and decode data from the module;
* a SLOw command Generator (SLOG[14]) that allows the generation of slow commands for the control and configuration of ATLAS SCT Front-End chips;
* a CLOck And Control module (CLOAC[15]) that generates the clock, fast trigger and reset commands for the SCT modules, in the absence of a Timing, Trigger and Control system;
* a low voltage power supply[16], for the digital and analogue part of the chips (Vdd and Vcc);
* an high voltage supply[17], to bias the module detectors up to 500 V.

The DAQ software is a collection of C++ libraries (SCTDAQ [18]) used together with the ROOT package [19]: raw data acquired in each test are analysed by single root macros and stored in a database.

A single module is characterized to check the functionality and performance stability, and to verify if the specifications are met. Using the internal calibration circuit of the ABCD chips, the front end parameters such as gain, noise and channel-to-channel threshold spread are measured. The characterization procedure is described in detail in [18] and here a short summary is reported:

* digital tests are executed to identify chip or hybrid damage;

Figure 1: _Schematics of SCTDAQ system._* an optimization of the delay between trigger and signal is performed on a chip by chip basis;
* to minimize the impact of the threshold non-uniformity across the channels on the noise occupancy, the ABCD3T design foresees the possibility to adjust the discriminator offsets. A threshold correction using a digital-to-analogue converter (Trim DAC) per channel with four selectable ranges, has been implemented in the ASICs [20]. The so called _trimming_ procedure allows an improved matching of the discriminator thresholds; this is an issue especially for irradiated modules, due to the increasing of threshold spread with radiation dose;
* the gain and electronic noise (ENC) are obtained channel by channel with threshold scans performed with 10 injected charges in a range from 0.5 to 8 fC (ResponseCurve procedure). For each charge injected, the corresponding value in mV is extracted as the 50% point of the threshold scan fitted with a complementary error function (s-curve). The gain, input noise and offset are deduced from the correlation of injected charge in fC versus the voltage output (mV);
* a threshold scan without any charge injection is performed to yield a direct measurement of noise occupancy at 1 fC.
* to determine the timewalk a dedicated scan is also executed: setting the comparator threshold to 1 fC, for each value of injected charge (over a range of 1.25 to 10 fC), a complementary error function is fitted to the falling edge of a plot of efficiency vs. the setting of the delay register, to determine the delay at which the efficiency is 50%. The timewalk is given by the difference between delays calculated for 1.25 and for 10 fC charge injected.

The endcap prototype modules are tested in custom designed aluminium boxes [21] which provide mechanical support as well as cooling. In these boxes, the modules are mounted on two aluminium surfaces, one beneath the hybrid, the other one at the far end of the detectors. Both surfaces are cooled with an alcohol-water mixture provided by a Huber chiller.

## 3 Calibration factor and temperature dependence

Two types of corrections have to be taken into account to compare modules with each other and with the real SCT conditions in ATLAS. First, the module characterization uses a calibration circuit that generates a voltage step pulse which is coupled to the front-end via a calibration capacitor (Ccal). To take into account variations of the capacitance from the design value, estimations of the correction factors are deduced from oxide thickness measurements of test capacitors placed all over the ASIC wafer: table 1 shows the correction factor (C.F.) that must be applied in order to compare modules with each other. The real (corrected) gain and noise ENC are then given by:

\[\mbox{Real gain = Meas. gain/C.F.};\qquad\qquad\mbox{Real ENC = Meas. ENC \times C.F.}\]

The second important correction concerns the temperature at which the measurements are made. The goal during SCT operation is to provide the most beneficial temperature conditions for positive annealing of the silicon detectors. Therefore the aim is to cool the detectors to -7\({}^{\circ}\)C in nitrogen atmosphere, using a two phase evaporative refrigerator cycle system, based on C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\). Following simulations performed on the thermal conditions for the SCT, this corresponds to a temperature around +2 \({}^{\circ}\)C on the hybrid, measured by a thermistor placed on it.

To make electrical test results performed in the laboratory comparable with each other and with the real experiment conditions, front-end parameters sensitive to the temperature, such as gain and ENC noise, need to be normalized. Unirradiated modules are usually tested in an atmosphere at room temperature and are cooled with a liquid mixture at +15 \({}^{\circ}\)C provided by a chiller: the measured thermistor temperatures were in a range from 30\({}^{\circ}\) to 40 \({}^{\circ}\)C. For irradiated modules, a cold environment is necessary to keep the detector temperature reasonably low to reduce the leakage current and prevent reverse annealing. A climate chamber set to -7 \({}^{\circ}\)C has been used to host the module, in addition to the chiller set to -16 \({}^{\circ}\)C (effective coolant temperature \(\sim\) -14.5 \({}^{\circ}\)C). Measurements performed on outer unirradiated modules (see figure 2) show the correlation between noise and thermistor temperature which can be fitted linearly with a slope of 5.8 e\({}^{-}\) ENC/\({}^{\circ}\)C. Similar measurements have been performed for unirradiated inner modules, that lead to a correction of about 4.7 e\({}^{-}\)/\({}^{\circ}\)C (see figure 3).

The low accuracy both in the measured noise (ENC error estimation \(\sim\) 30 e\({}^{-}\) ENC [22]) and in the thermistor temperature (T error \(\sim\) 1\({}^{\circ}\)C) lead to an error on the slope of \(\sim\)\(\pm\) 1.0 e\({}^{-}\) ENC/\({}^{\circ}C\).

For outer half irradiated and fully irradiated modules, the study has been performed using a constant temperature of -7\({}^{\circ}\)C for the environment. For half irradiated modules, the slope of a linear fit results in a temperature dependence of the noise around 24 e\({}^{-}\) ENC/\({}^{\circ}\)C with an uncertainty of \(\pm\) 7 e\({}^{-}\) ENC/\({}^{\circ}\)C, due also to the large error on the ENC values (\(\pm\) 60 e\({}^{-}\) ENC). For a fully irradiated module, the results obtained for the ENC noise extracted from the response curve (RC) and from the noise occupancy are shown in figure 4. The right hand side plot the ENC from the RC and the left hand side one is the ENC from the noise occupancy scan, obtained assuming that all sources of noise are gaussian, and fitting the occupancy as a function of the threshold by:

\begin{table}

\end{table}
Table 1: _Calibration factors for each module. The 12 ASICs mounted on a single hybrid come from the same wafer and are supposed to have the same calibration factor, so that a global correction to the module can be applied._Figure 3: _Temperature dependence of the noise for an unirradiated inner module at V\({}_{bias}\) = 150 V._

Figure 2: _Left: Temperature dependence of the noise is 5.8 e\({}^{-}\)/\({}^{\circ}C\) for an unirradiated outer module (ambient temperature at about +20 \({}^{\circ}\)C, V\({}_{bias}\) = 150 V). Right: The same plot for an irradiated module with ambient temperature at - 7 \({}^{\circ}\)C and constant V\({}_{bias}\) = 350 V: the slope extracted from a linear fit is \(\sim\)24 e\({}^{-}\) ENC/\({}^{\circ}\)C._

It can be seen that the variation of ENC with temperature is not linear. Fitting by a straight line gives slopes varying between 17 or 24 e\({}^{-}\)/\({}^{o}\)C (RC and NO respectively) when the fit range is the whole interval [-6\({}^{o}\)C;-2\({}^{o}\)C], and 30 e\({}^{-}\)/\({}^{o}\)C when fitting only the last part of the plots.

The temperature range of the measurements is limited from below by the chiller capacity, and from above by the fact that the module trips due to the 5 mA power supply limit, when the chiller temperature is set higher than about \(-15^{o}\)C (\(T_{hyb}\approx-2^{o}\)C).

The fact that the module cannot run at the expected temperature of 2\({}^{o}\)C is due to an unexpected self-heating of the detectors, as can also be seen on figure 5, where leakage current measurements performed at different temperatures (module powered) are shown.

This also explains that the variation of ENC versus temperature measured doesn't match the one calculated using analytical expressions for the total ENC. Five different contributions to the noise can indeed be isolated [23]:

\[ENC_{Ic} = \frac{e^{3}}{12\sqrt{3}}\sqrt{\frac{2kT}{g_{m}}}\frac{C_{e}+C_{d} +C_{F}}{\sqrt{t_{peak}}}\frac{1}{q}\] \[ENC_{Ib} = \frac{e^{3}}{36}\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\sqrt{t_{peak}}\sqrt{\frac{2qI _{C}}{\beta}}\frac{1}{q}\] \[ENC_{det} = \frac{e^{3}}{36}\sqrt{\frac{5}{3}}\sqrt{t_{peak}}\sqrt{2qI_{ leak}+4kT\left(\frac{1}{R_{F}}+\frac{1}{R_{bias}}\right)}\frac{1}{q}\] \[ENC_{rbb} = \frac{e^{3}}{12\sqrt{3}}\sqrt{4kTR_{bb}}\;\frac{C_{d}+C_{F}}{ \sqrt{t_{peak}}}\frac{1}{q}\]

Figure 4: _Temperature dependence of the ENC for irradiated K5 503. On the l.h.s.: ENC from the noise occupancy; on the r.h.s.: ENC from the RC. Values are corrected for the calibration factor and fitted by a straight line. The first value of the slope corresponds to a fit over the whole range of temperature, and the second one over the last part of the plots._

\[ENC_{corr}=\frac{e^{3}}{12\sqrt{3}}\sqrt{\frac{4kT}{g_{m}}}\sqrt{\frac{(C_{d}+C_{e }+C_{F})C_{C}}{t_{peak}}}\frac{1}{q}\]

where \(e=2.718...\), \(q\) is the electron charge, \(k\) the Boltzman constant, \(\beta\) is the current gain (between 150-200 for a non irradiated module and 20-50 for an irradiated one), T is the temperature, either of the chips, or of the detectors for \(ENC_{det}\). \(C_{F}=120fF\) is the feedback capacitor, \(C_{e}=0.6pF\) is the internal input capacitance of the chip, \(C_{d}\approx 18pF\) is the detector capacitance, \(I_{C}\) is the collector current per channels (about 110 \(\mu A\) per channel for irradiated modules), \(g_{m}=qI_{C}/kT\) is the transconductance of the transistor and \(t_{peak}=20ns\) is the peaking time. Typical values for the resistances are \(R_{bb}=180\Omega\), \(R_{F}=80k\Omega\) and \(R_{bias}=1M\Omega\). \(ENC_{Ic}\) is the collector current shot noise, \(ENC_{Ib}\) is the base current noise, \(ENC_{Rb}\) is the base spread resistance noise, \(ENC_{corr}\) is the correlation term, and \(ENC_{det}\) is the detector contribution. The main uncertainties are the detector and chip temperatures. The temperature of the detectors are taken to vary between -15\({}^{o}\)C and -7\({}^{o}\)C and the chips are supposed to be 20 degrees warmer. These are plausible values, even if there is no way from the previous measurements to deduce directly the chips and detector temperature. The results are however not very dependent on the detector temperature range, and are summarized in figure 6.

The measurements and this estimation are thus not consistent, since the slope deduced from the measurements is around 30 e\({}^{-}\)/\({}^{o}\)C, whereas the estimated one is around 9 e\({}^{-}\)/\({}^{o}\)C. The same self-heating phenomenon is true for the half-irradiated modules. However, the measurements were performed in a test box without split cooling block. The coupling between the hybrid and the detectors is thus more important than what it should be in the experiment. In addition, a liquid cooling was used, instead of the foreseen \(C_{3}F_{8}\) evaporative cooling [11]. Nevertheless, since this temperature correction is needed to compare module with each other in the laboratory tests performed, the results are presented using a correction of 24 e\({}^{-}\) ENC/\({}^{o}\)C and 30 e\({}^{-}\) ENC/\({}^{o}\)C for half-irradiated and irradiated modules respectively.

## 4 Results from electrical tests of non-irradiated modules

A total of eighteen modules have been tested during 2002 in all the involved institutes: table 2 summarizes the front-end parameters as measured for the non-irradiated modules. It should be noticed that the outer module type corresponds the least favorable case in terms of noise, due to the higher contribution of longer detector strips (\(\simeq 1500\) e\({}^{-}\) ENC noise to be compared to the \(\simeq 1200\) e\({}^{-}\) for the inner module).

The average module gain is about 49 mV/fC, corrected for each module with the appropriate calibration factor; using this correction and normalizing to the SCT temperature, the ENC noise in all outer modules is about 1430 e\({}^{-}\), while the average for the middle and the inner are 1330 and 1160 e\({}^{-}\), respectively. In addition, the table reports the channel-to-channel threshold spread at 1 fC: matching of the gain and offset is a critical issue for a binary architecture and the non-uniformity acts as an effective contribution to the noise. The occupancy due to the effective noise at 1 fC is summarized in the last column of table 2 (see also figure 7). The column labeled as _corr_ indicates the noise occupancy values corrected for the calibration capacitance variation and for the temperature, as mentioned in section 3. This correction was performed by fitting the occupancy as a function of the threshold, by the complementary error function (1), assuming that the noise is purely gaussian. Inverting this complementary error function leads, for a given value of the noise occupancy, to a value of the ENC noise. This ENC noise is then corrected as specified above, and the corrected noise occupancy is obtained using once more the interpolation (1). It has to be noticed that the prototype hybrids have been equipped with non perfect - that is 1-dead channel - chips, except for K5 503 and 504, whose chips were perfect ones. The unirradiated modules are well inside the requested specifications, having average noise ENC \(<1500\) e\({}^{-}\), noise occupancy below the foreseen limit 5\(\times 10^{-4}\) and efficiency in terms of working channel \(>99\%\). Figure 8 shows a representative timewalk scan. The typical timewalk that has been measured for unirradiated modules varies between 11 and 14 ns.

Figure 6: _Different contributions to the total ENC noise, plotted vs detector temperature._

## 5 Irradiated modules

Seven of the modules have been irradiated at different fluences, with the 24 GeV proton beam of the CERN PS using the SCT irradiation facility. Four of them (K5 305, 308, 503, 504) have been irradiated with the nominal fluence of about 3\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) protons/cm\({}^{2}\)- simulating approximately 10 years of ATLAS operation. Two of them (K5 310, K5 303) have been irradiated to half the dose (fluence of about 1.5\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) protons/cm\({}^{2}\)). The remaining module (K5 312) has undergone a full irradiation in two steps: the first one was up to half the dose, and the second one four months later, to reach the total fluence [9]. We summarize in this section the electrical performance of these irradiated end-cap modules.

Unless otherwise specified, the measurements with irradiated modules were performed in a cli

On the left: for each injected charge, a chip by chip scan of efficiency vs. delay is performed to extract the 50\(\%\) point of the falling edge. The corresponding delay (DAC units) is plotted vs. the injected charge and the timewalk is the difference between delay values at 10 fC and 1.25 fC. On the right: to convert DAC units to ns, the efficiency curve vs. delay (DAC units) is used. The width of the plateau, calculated as difference between the 50\(\%\) point of falling and raising edge, should be 25 ns, so the conversion factor is extracted._

The dot indicates the 1 fC point as identified in the trimming procedure._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:13]

In addition to the damage of silicon detectors, the irradiation affects the front-end electronics. The ABCD chips are sensitive to ionization effects as well as to displacement damage. These contribute to a degradation of the current gain factor \(\beta\) of the input transistor, and consequently to an increase in the noise of the front-end; furthermore, the offset spread of the discriminator and the speed of the digital CMOS part are effected.

As consequence of the \(\beta\) factor degradation, the optimum values for shaper and preamplifier currents decrease; two 5-bit DAC implemented on the ASICs permit to change these values and the working point estimation is done checking different combinations of preamplifier and shaper current. Each chip can be independently adjusted and the front-end settings have therefore been re-optimized to obtain a high gain, but making a compromise to lose as few channels as possible. This procedure, the so called current scan, was done as the first step of the electrical tests, followed by the standard strobe delay and trimming test. For irradiated modules, the trim procedure is especially important, due to the increase in the ABCD discriminator threshold spread: more channels have to use large-range trimDAQ settings, where the correction step-size is coarser.

The data presented are corrected both for calibration capacitor variation and for temperature, as explained in Sections 3 and 4. Measurements of the calibration DAQ after irradiation show that there is no major change in the calibration capacitor [24] and the same values for the calibration factors (see table 1) will thus be used. The bias voltage has to be increase after irradiation and all tests presented are performed biasing the detectors at 500V. In Table 3 are displayed the gain,

Figure 9: _Leakage current for half and fully irradiated modules._

threshold spread, noise and noise occupancy of the half irradiated modules. Masked channels are also specified, since they have a direct influence on the module efficiency. No more than 1% of the channels should be lost on a module, which turns out to be satisfied by K5 303 and 312. However, K5 310 had one masked chip due to read-out problems.

As can be seen in this table, the noise occupancy values are between 5.0\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) and 15.6\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) at 1 fC thresheld and ENC noise is between \(\approx 1899\) and \(\approx 2115\). Considering the fact that the luminosity will initially be lower, it can be expected from the previous results that the end-cap modules will reach the specification limits after about 7 years [1], if operated at the above threshold.

The front end parameters of the five fully irradiated modules are summarized in table 4. The noise level is between \(\approx 2140\) and \(\approx 2430\) e\({}^{-}\) ENC, and the noise occupancy between 27 and 160 \(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\), while the specifications are 1800 e\({}^{-}\) ENC and 5\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) respectively. To reach the noise occupancy level required by the specifications, a threshold of at least 1.2 fC is thus necessary, as verified by plotting the noise occupancy distribution per channel (see Figure 12). Test beam analyses are then required to determine whether it is possible to use this threshold while maintaining the specified efficiency level [25].

The gain and ENC noise variation with the irradiation dose is summarized in figure 11.

K5 310 has a masked chip due to readout errors. The specifications are \(5\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) for the noise occupancy, 15 masked channels at most, and an ENC not exceeding 1800e\({}^{-}\)._ENC noise measurements have been performed on a long time scale to evaluate the dependence of the noise on the time of bias. The results are displayed in Figure 10 for K5 312 and K5 503, left biased at 500V. An \(\approx\) 36 hours time scale study was performed with K5 312, while K5 503 has been biased during more than six days. It can be clearly seen from Figure 10 that the noise is decreasing very slowly, as it was already observed in [26]. Between the first and the last measurement performed on K5 312, the ENC varies by more than 300 e\({}^{-}\) ENC. In addition, it is shown for K5 503 that even on a much longer time scale, the noise is still decreasing.

The time walk of fully irradiated K5 312, representative of the timewalk results for the irradiated modules, is displayed in figure 13. It shows a high number of channels with large timewalk: 746

channels out of the 1536 have a timewalk larger than the specification of 16 ns, and 11 being in another bunch crossing (that is above 25ns).

The degradation in timing performance is correlated with radiation effects in the analog part of the ABCD circuit. Modifying the digital power supply \(V_{dd}\) thus did not lead to any improvement of the timewalk. On the contrary, the high number of slow channels can be significantly reduced by increasing the analog voltage, \(V_{cc}\), supplied to the chips. The time walk profiles for \(V_{cc}=\) 3.5V and \(V_{cc}=\) 3.8V are compared in figure 14. Table 5 shows the influence of increasing \(V_{cc}\) from the nominal value of 3.5V to 3.8V by step of 0.1V. For this latter value, the timewalk distribution becomes flat across the chips and only 190 channels are above the required 16 ns, all of them having a timewalk less than 20ns. In addition to significantly reducing the discriminator timewalk for many channels, operating the ASICs at \(V_{cc}=\) 3.8V instead of the nominal value

also slightly improves the front-end parameters, as can be seen in Table 6; in particular, the gain is on average 3 mV/fC higher and the noise occupancy is slightly reduced. It also allows the recovery of some channels, masked mainly because of the impossibility of being trimmed. However, the gain still remains non-uniform across the chips, as shown in figure 15.

The main issue in increasing the analog voltage when running irradiated modules concerns the power consumption of the module. This latter should not exceed 7W on the hybrid, and 2.6 W

Since the front-end bias currents of irradiated modules are smaller than the ones of non irradiated, the power consumption can be maintained within this limit, as shown in table 7, where the maximal power consumption for all irradiated modules, for \(V_{cc}=3.5\)V and \(V_{cc}=3.8\)V, is evaluated.

Conclusion

The electrical performance of end-cap pre-production prototypes, has been described. Measurements were performed on single module test benches for all the three types of end-cap modules. Given the fact that up to eighteen modules have been studied, the results obtained are representative of the typical performance of the end-cap module prototypes.

The non irradiated modules are well within the specifications, with a noise occupancy not exceeding 4\(\times\)10\({}^{-5}\) and a mean ENC noise of 1440 e\({}^{-}\) ENC in the least favorable case of outer modules. Two outer modules have been irradiated to the level of approximately 1.5\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) protons/cm\({}^{2}\), corresponding to half the fluence expected during ten years of the ATLAS life time. The noise occupancy then reaches values between 5 and 16 \(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) and ENC noise between 1900 and 2115 e\({}^{-}\) ENC.

Five modules have been irradiated at the full dose, resulting in a noise occupancy level between about 27\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) and 160 \(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\), and an ENC noise in the range 2140-2430 e\({}^{-}\) ENC, while the specifications are respectively 5 \(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\) and 1800 e\({}^{-}\) ENC. The nominal noise occupancy limits would be met by increasing the threshold of the discriminator up to at least 1.2 fC. Nevertheless, beam tests are required to evaluate the efficiency achievable at such thresholds. The characterization of these irradiated modules has been made over a period of several days. The ENC noise in particular decreases sensibly, over several days under bias (few hundreds of electrons). At the nominal value of the analog voltage of the front-end chips, many channels have a time walk larger than 16 ns, and a significant number of channels are even in another bunch crossing. However, it is worth noticing that increasing the analog voltage from 3.5V to 3.8V reduces considerably the discriminator time walk for many of them, thus permitting the recovery of almost all channels. In addition, when operating the ASICs at this increased voltage, there is a slight improvement of the gain (3mV/fC) and the noise occupancy.

The SCT end-cap modules passed a Final Design Review in December 2002 and production is now under way.
