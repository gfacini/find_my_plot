###### Abstract

This note presents an evaluation of the discovery potential of Supersymmetry for channels with jets, leptons and missing transverse energy with the ATLAS detector. The LHC running scenario at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV, delivering an integrated luminosity of 0.5 - 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the 2010-2011 run, is investigated.

Introduction

Supersymmetry (SUSY) [1] is a theoretically favoured candidate for physics beyond the Standard Model. Cosmological arguments suggest that the lightest SUSY particle is stable and weakly interacting and so would escape detection in ATLAS. A description of the ATLAS detector can be found in [2].

This note describes prospects for new phenomena searches in channels with a combination of jets, leptons and missing transverse energy. Signals investigated in this study are from minimal Supergravity (mSUGRA) models [3] with R-parity conservation. These studies assume an LHC centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and an integrated luminosity \(\mathcal{L}=0.5-2\) fb\({}^{-1}\). The current Tevatron limits on the mSUGRA parameter space, obtained from a similar type of analysis, can be found in [4, 5].

The searches for generic SUSY signatures with R-parity conservation are performed by searching for an excess of events in various channels. These channels explore a large variety of possible signals, e.g. different jet (\(\geq 2\), \(\geq 3\), \(\geq 4\)) and lepton (0, 1, 2, 3) multiplicities as well as channels with taus and photons [6]. Previous studies were presented for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and \(\mathcal{L}=1\)fb\({}^{-1}\) in [6] and for \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV and \(\mathcal{L}=200\) pb\({}^{-1}\) presented in [7, 8] for channels with \(\geq 2\), \(\geq 3\) or \(\geq 4\) jets and 0-2 leptons.

This note extends these results for \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV and proves that the cuts proposed in [7, 8] for \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, which due to the reduced centre-of-mass energy are slightly different from the ones in [6] designed for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, can lead to an early discovery for a broad range of SUSY models also at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. This article relies on work published in [6, 8] about the background estimation in SUSY searches.

This note is organized as follows: the second section describes briefly the Monte Carlo generation of SUSY models, the third section the generation of background processes, the fourth and fifth section presents the object identification and event selection. Finally we discuss the discovery potential.

## 2 Monte Carlo simulation

Event samples are simulated partly with a full GEANT4 [9]-based simulation of the detector [10], and partly with a faster simulation ATLFAST2 [10]. ATLFAST2 includes a GEANT4 simulation of the inner detector and muon system supplemented by a fast calorimeter simulation. It was used to provide large statistics of background events and to simulate the signal samples.

### Reweighting to \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV

The Standard Model and SUSY signal samples are identical to the ones used in Ref. [7, 8], but have been reweighted to a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV.

In order to correct the Monte Carlo samples generated at 10 TeV centre-of-mass energy to a 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy the LHAPDF software package [11] has been used, taking the CTEQ6L as a proton parton density function (pdf). The pdf-reweighting procedure has been tested on a few MC samples by comparing the reweighted 10 TeV Monte Carlo distributions with the 7 TeV Monte Carlo distributions. They agreed well within the statistical uncertainties of the MC samples.

### Monte Carlo simulation of SUSY events

In the following we briefly describe our simulation of event samples in a model, where SUSY breaking is mediated by gravitational interaction (mSUGRA). All studied scenarios assume that the R-parity quantum number is conserved. SUSY particles are thus produced in pairs and each particle then decays into states which include the lightest SUSY particle (LSP).

The mSUGRA model is defined by 5 parameters: the common boson mass at the Grand Unification (GUT) scale \(m_{0}\), the common fermion mass at the GUT scale \(m_{1/2}\), the ratio of the Higgs vacuum expectation values \(\tan\beta\), the common GUT scale trilinear coupling \(A_{0}\) and the sign of the Higgs potential parameter \(\mu\).

In order to cover a large parameter space and to reduce the number of SUSY points mSUGRA grids were made in "radial coordinates", i.e. points on outgoing radial lines in the \((m_{0},m_{1/2})\) plane for \(\tan\beta=10\). Lines with different slopes in the \((m_{0},m_{1/2})\) plane were produced. The other mSUGRA parameters are set to the same values as in [6], i.e. \(A_{0}=0\), \(\mu>0\).

The SUSY spectra were generated with ISAJET 7.75 [12]. The samples were generated using HERWIG 6.5 [13, 14] and simulated using the ATLFAST2simulation. These samples are identical to the samples used in the studies for a centre-of mass energy of 10 TeV [7, 8].

The signal samples were normalized to the HERWIG cross section.

### Monte Carlo simulation of background processes

The Standard Model background processes most relevant to SUSY searches are \(t\bar{t}\), \(W+\mathrm{jets}\), \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\), single top, diboson and QCD jet production. Top pair production, single top and diboson samples are based on a full simulation of the ATLAS detector using the GEANT4 program, the remaining samples were simulated with ATLFAST2. The generator cross section is used for the Monte Carlo normalization except for the background from top pair production.

Single top and top pair productionThe \(t\bar{t}\) process is the dominant background for most of the SUSY channels studied here. The MC@NLO [15, 16] generator, including full NLO QCD corrections has been used to simulate the hard process. Parton showering and fragmentation were simulated by the HERWIG+JIMMY [13, 17, 18] generator. The \(t\bar{t}\) cross sections were normalized to the NLO+NLL result [19].

In addition to the \(t\bar{t}\) process, single top production was simulated with the ACERMC [20] generator.

W/Z + jets productionThe vector boson production of \(W\) and \(Z\) plus jets are important backgrounds for Supersymmetric searches both with and without leptons. As the SUSY event selection often requires many jets in the final state, it is particularly important to correctly produce the kinematics of multiparton final states. For this reason, the ALPGEN [21] MC generator including LO electroweak and QCD effects for multiparton hard processes has been chosen. Jet production was generated using up to 5-parton Matrix Elements. The generator is interfaced to HERWIG for showering and fragmentation processes.

QCD jet productionFor reasons similar to those discussed above, for the generation of \(W/Z+\mathrm{jets}\) events, the use of multiparton generators is desirable for QCD production. A large sample of QCD events has been generated with the ALPGEN MC generator. The generation was split according to the type of quark produced (\(b\)-quarks or light quarks) and the \(P_{T}\) of the leading jet. Jet production was generated here using up to 5-parton Matrix Elements for light quarks and up to 4-parton Matrix Elements for \(b\)-quark production.

DibosonDiboson processes have a small cross-section with respect to the previously discussed background processes, but contribute to the multi-leptons search channels. In the present study, \(WW\), \(ZZ\) and \(WZ\) processes decaying to leptons have been included. The samples \(ZZ\) and \(WZ\) were simulated with the MC@NLO generator, whereas the gg2WW [22] and the MC@NLO generator was used for \(WW\) production.

Lepton, jet and missing transverse energy reconstruction

A general search strategy for standard SUSY signatures would be the selection of events with large missing transverse energy and reconstructed particles with large transverse momentum. At the LHC these objects are predominantly jets since the coupling strength of the strong force would cause an abundance of squarks and gluinos if these particles are not prohibitively heavy. Squarks or gluinos will cascade decay to jets, leptons or photons, depending on the SUSY parameters, and missing transverse energy caused by the LSPs and neutrinos. In order to classify events in different exclusive channels, the same object identification criteria are used for all channels.

### Object selection

The following object selection defines particle candidates used in the event selection. The object selection criteria are similar to the ones used in Ref. [6] and identical to the one used in Ref. [7, 8].

**Jets**: are reconstructed with a narrow cone algorithm (cone size of 0.4) to take into account the typical large multiplicity of supersymmetric events. The jet algorithm is run on calorimeter "towers", which are obtained from calorimeter cells projected onto a fixed grid in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) with a bin size \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\). Two acceptance cuts are required in addition: \(P_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\)1 to ensure a good jet calibration.

Footnote 1: The pseudorapidity is defined as \(\eta=-\ln\tan\frac{\theta}{2}\), where \(\theta\) is the polar angle of a given object.
**Electrons**: are reconstructed and identified with the so-called "medium" purity cuts [6] and are required to be isolated in the calorimeter, i.e. the total calorimeter energy within a cone of \(\Delta R<0.2\) should be less than 10 GeV. In addition to those standard cuts, the \(P_{T}\) of electrons should exceed 10 GeV and \(|\eta|\) should be less than 2.5.
**Muons**: are reconstructed by an algorithm which performs a statistical combination of a track reconstructed in the muon spectrometer with its corresponding track in the inner detector [6].

In order to select isolated muons, the total calorimeter energy within a cone of \(\Delta R<0.2\) should be less than 10 GeV. Finally the standard acceptance cuts of \(P_{T}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are used.
**Missing transverse energy**: is computed from calorimeter cells with calibration weights which are object dependent, and corrected for (well reconstructed) muons [6].

### Overlap removal

When candidates passing the object selection overlap with each other, a classification is required to remove all but one of the overlapping objects. All overlapping criteria are based on the simple geometric \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\phi^{2}+\Delta\eta}^{2}\) variable and applied in the following order [6] :

1. If an electron and a jet are found within \(\Delta R<0.2\), keep the electron and reject the jet.
2. If a muon and a jet are found within \(\Delta R<0.4\), keep the jet and reject the muon
3. If an electron and a jet are found within \(0.2\leq\Delta R<0.4\), keep the jet and reject the electron.

Event selection

In this note we study different channels where the number of jets ranges from \(\geq 2\) to \(\geq 4\) and the number of leptons can vary from 0 to 2. The word lepton is used to denote isolated electrons and muons. Analysis channels with different lepton multiplicity requirements are mutually exclusive. The selection criteria are identical to the cuts used in the previous study [7, 8].

In all channels, events are vetoed if an electron passes the object selection in the electromagnetic calorimeter transition region \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\). The cut is applied to exclude electrons reconstructed in the barrel-endcap transition region of the electromagnetic calorimeter that will not be properly calibrated with early data.

The effective mass (\(M_{\rm eff}\)) is the scalar sum of transverse momenta of all main objects and is defined as:

\[M_{\rm eff}\equiv\sum_{i=1}^{N_{jets}}P_{T}^{\rm jet,\,i}+\sum_{i=1}^{N_{lep}} P_{T}^{\rm lep,\,i}+E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\]

where \(N_{jets}\) is the number of jets (2-4) and \(N_{lep}\) is the number of leptons (0-2) defining the analysis. Other high \(P_{T}\) jets or leptons are not included in the sum.

Other event variables like the transverse mass and transverse sphericity are defined in [7, 8].

The cuts on the number of jets and on the transverse momentum of jets are common to the channels with different lepton multiplicities. These cuts are summarized in Table 1. The \(P_{T}\) cuts on the jets are chosen in order to be in accordance with the multijet trigger requirements and in order to reject a sufficient amount of QCD jet background.

In the following we describe the event selection criteria for the 0, 1 and 2 lepton channels.

Zero-lepton channelsIn addition to the electron crack veto, the pre-selection cuts are:

1. Reject events with at least one lepton having \(P_{T}>20\) GeV.
2. Cut on the number of jets and jet transverse momenta as defined in Table 1.
3. Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>80\) GeV.
4. Cut on ratio \(f\) between \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(M_{\rm eff}\) as defined in Table 1.
5. Cut on \(\Delta\phi(jet_{i},E_{T}^{miss})\) as defined in Table 1.
6. Transverse sphericity, \(S_{T}>0.2\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Number of jets & \(\geq 2\) jets & \(\geq 3\) jets & \(\geq 4\) jets \\ \hline Leading jet \(P_{T}\) (GeV) & \(>180\) & \(>100\) & \(>100\) \\ Other jets \(P_{T}\) (GeV) & \(>50\) (Jet 2) & \(>40\) (Jet 2-3) & \(>40\) (Jet 2-4) \\ \(\Delta\phi(jet_{i},E_{T}^{miss})\) & [\(>0.2\),\(>0.2\)] & [\(>0.2\),\(>0.2\),\(>0.2\)] & [\(>0.2\),\(>0.2\),\(>0.2\),\(>0.0\)] \\ \(E_{T}^{miss}>f\times M_{\rm eff}\) & \(f=0.3\) & \(f=0.25\) & \(f=0.2\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The cuts are shown for each of the studied jet multiplicities.

One-lepton channelsIn addition to the electron crack veto, the pre-selection cuts are:

1. One lepton with \(P_{T}>20\) GeV, no additional lepton with \(P_{T}>10\) GeV.
2. Cut on the number of jets and jet transverse momenta as defined in Table 1.
3. Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>80\) GeV.
4. Cut on ratio \(f\) between \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(M_{\rm eff}\) as defined in Table 1.
5. Cut on \(\Delta\phi(jet_{i},E_{T}^{miss})\) as defined in Table 1.
6. Transverse sphericity, \(S_{T}>0.2\).
7. Transverse mass, \(M_{T}>100\) GeV.

Two-lepton opposite-sign channelIn addition to the electron crack veto, the pre-selection cuts are:

1. Exactly two leptons with \(P_{T}>10\) GeV and opposite charge.
2. Cut on the number of jets and jet transverse momenta as defined in Table 1.
3. Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>80\) GeV.
4. Cut on \(\Delta\phi(jet_{i},E_{T}^{miss})\) as defined in Table 1.
5. Cut on ratio \(f\) between \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(M_{\rm eff}\) as defined in Table 1.
6. Transverse sphericity, \(S_{T}>0.2\).

Two-lepton same-sign channelIn addition to the electron crack veto, the pre-selection cuts are:

1. Two leptons with \(P_{T}>20\) GeV and same charge and \(m_{\ell\ell}>5\) GeV. No additional lepton with \(P_{T}>10\) GeV.
2. Two jets with transverse momenta \(P_{T}>80\) GeV
3. Missing transverse energy \(E_{T}^{miss}>80\) GeV.
4. Transverse mass computed with the leading lepton, \(M_{T}>80\) GeV.

Trigger EfficiencyThe trigger efficiency has been studied for the initial LHC running scenario. Combined jet and missing transverse energy triggers yield an efficiency well above 95% for luminosities of \(1\times 10^{32}\rm cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). For simplicity we assume in the following study a trigger efficiency of 100%.

## 5 Results

### Distributions

Since it is impossible to scan the high dimensional SUSY parameter space by developing optimal cuts for each parameter point we pursue the signal search by a parameter-independent approach. The \(M_{\rm eff}\) distribution, which yields best performance [6], is used to search for a deviation between SM+SIGNAL and the SM expectation.

Kinematic distributions are shown for illustrative purpose using events from the SU4 mSUGRA point. SU4 is a low mass point close to the Tevatron bound [4, 5] with \(m_{0}=200\) GeV, \(m_{1/2}=160\) GeV, \(A_{0}=-400\) GeV, \(\tan\beta=10\) and \(\mu>0.410\) GeV. The cross section for SU4 is 51 pb.

0-lepton channelsDistributions of the effective mass for the 0-lepton channels are presented in Figure 1. Figure 2 shows the distributions of the missing transverse energy for the SM backgrounds for the 4 jet channel. The \(Z\) and \(W\) background dominates the 2-jet selection, whereas for events with 4 selected jets the background is dominated by top pair production. In the 3 jet channel the \(W\) and top backgrounds are found to be almost equally large.

1-lepton channelsThe effective mass \(M_{\rm eff}\) distributions are shown in Figure 3 for all 1-lepton channels. Figure 4 shows the transverse mass distribution for the 4-jet 1-lepton channel. A cut \(M_{T}>100\) GeV suppresses effectively the background from top and \(W\) production.

The dominating background for the 2-jet channels is top pair production with an important contribution from \(W+\rm jets\) in the low jet multiplicity channels. The background from single top production is comparable with the background from \(Z\). Diboson processes and the background from QCD events are very small for all jet multiplicities.

2-lepton with opposite sign charge channelsThe effective mass distributions for the 2-lepton channels with opposite sign (OS) charge are shown in Figure 5. The background in the opposite sign channels consists mainly of top-pairs. Although no \(Z\) mass veto was applied the background from \(Z\) production was found to be small.

2-lepton with same sign charge channelThe effective mass distributions for the 2-lepton channels with same sign (SS) charge are shown in Figure 6. As shown, the background contribution is very small (with only 2.2 events expected at 1 fb\({}^{-1}\)) and it comes only from \(t\bar{t}\) processes.

### Discovery reach

The discovery reach was calculated using the same approach as in [6, 7, 8]. The reach plots in this subsection are all made by finding the optimal \(M_{\rm eff}\) cut (in steps of 400 GeV) to maximize the significance \(Z_{N}\). The significance \(Z_{N}\) was calculated using a convolution of a Poisson and a Gaussian term to account for a systematic error. For a detailed explanation of the statistical procedure see [6] page 1590-1591.

The uncertainty in the determination of the sum of the various backgrounds was estimated in Ref. [6] for \(\mathcal{L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) to be \(\pm 20\%\) for \(W\), \(Z\) and top production and \(\pm 50\%\) for QCD processes. For an initial sample with smaller integrated luminosity at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV, these uncertainties need to be reevaluated. The uncertainty on the background as determined with data-driven methods has a statistical component, due to the finite size of the control samples, and a systematic component, due to detector performance uncertainties or uncertainties on correction factors. We compensate part of the loss of statistics in the control samples by making looser cuts on transverse momentum and missing transverse energy, as defined in Table 1. The systematic error is re-estimated accounting for the expected detector performance uncertainties in early data. Overall, we calculate for an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) (base scenario) an expected uncertainty of 50% (statistical+systematic) on the \(W\), \(Z\) and top backgrounds when these are estimated with data-driven methods. The QCD background is not dominant for all channels and the uncertainty was estimated in Ref. [6] to be \(\pm 60\%\) for a PYTHIA sample equivalent to 23.8 pb\({}^{-1}\). Data-driven background estimation will be a main topic of study in early data; we take an overall uncertainty of 70% for the 0.5 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario, 50% for the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) base scenario and 35% for the 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario. Without data a more precise determination of the systematic uncertainty is not possible. In order to estimate the effect of different systematic uncertainties, we have varied them within a range around the default values given above.

In the following plots we have only shown the channels with the largest discovery reach for each lepton multiplicity as found in [7, 8]. No attempt was made to combine the significance of the various channels.

Figure 7 shows the \(5\sigma\) discovery reach for the mSUGRA model with \(\tan\beta=10\) for the 4 jet 0 lepton, the 4 jet 1 lepton and the 2 jet 2 lepton (OS and SS) channels for the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario.

The 4 jet 0 lepton and 4 jet 1 lepton channels have the largest reach. Signals with a squark (first and second generation) and gluino masses up to 700 GeV could be discovered in a scenario were the gluino mass is similar to the mass of the light squarks.

Figure 8 shows how the discovery reach changes for the two alternative scenarios with 0.5 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.

A variation of the systematic uncertainties used for the calculation of the significance is shown in Figure 9 in order to estimate the influence of those uncertainties in the discovery reach.

## 6 Summary and conclusion

The background compositions and the discovery potential for inclusive SUSY search channels with 0, 1 or 2 leptons (OS and SS) and \(\geq\) 2, \(\geq\) 3 or \(\geq\) 4 jets have been investigated for a scenario assuming an LHC centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}\) of 7 TeV and an integrated luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=0.5-2\) fb\({}^{-1}\). The results of the scans presented indicate that ATLAS can discover signals of R-parity conserving SUSY with squark and gluino masses less than 700 GeV for \(\mathcal{L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) in the mSUGRA scenario.
