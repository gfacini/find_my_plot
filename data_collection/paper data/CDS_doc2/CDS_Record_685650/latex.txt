**Abstract**

First results from studies of three optional forward region treatments of the ATLAS detector are presented. The simulations were done at GEANT mixture level, and the GCALOR package was used in neutron and photon fluence calculations. Three forward region options are described. Single particle response as a function of \(\eta\), particle fluences, and ionization doses are reported for each option.

**Overview of the Method**

The University of Arizona, as collaborators in GEM, the former SSC experiment, specialized in design development of the forward region, and in the computer simulation of several GEM design options for this region. We are now applying that experience and those methods to the forward region of the ATLAS detector, and are here reporting the first results of these investigations.

Many of the issues of the forward region span detector subsystems, and in simulation most of the performance studies in this region can be done using GEANT mixtures. There is no need to describe calorimeter modules, for example, to detailed 'electrode' level. This greatly reduces the computing time while maintaining realism in representing the effects of structures such as cryostat walls, beampipes and flanges, mechanical supports, shielding, etc. The group at the University of Arizona employs a specific scheme for tuning the GEANT mixtures (described in detail in reference 1). These GEANT mixture geometries may be used for the calculation of single particle response, jet response (including \(e/h\) effects and weighting procedures), neutron, photon, and charged particle fluences, and ionization dose rates. They are _not_ optimal for investigating high resolution topics such as the electron response in EM accordions-which require detailed GEANT simulation. On the other hand, once numbers such as the accordion electron resolution are known, either from testbeam or detailed GEANT simulation, they may be entered as smearing parameters in the mixture simulation to increase its accuracy.

The geometry used here is a '2D' z-\(\rho\) representation, employing only TUBE and CONE GEANT volume shapes. That is, it is \(\phi\) symmetric. Inthe future, radial slabs will be added so that structures such as gaps between calorimeter modules may be introduced. An ASCII file, with conditional flags to allow for design options, is used to initialize the volume dimensions and media. The studies reported here do not include cell segmentation of the calorimeter modules, since running with segmentation incurs a speed penalty. In GEM, the segmentation effects were negligible, and we expect the same to be true of ATLAS. (Segmentation studies will be part of the next round of ATLAS simulations at Arizona.)

In the forward region, there are many things to optimize at once: the muon chamber coverage at high \(\eta\), the \(P_{t}\) resolution of the endcap and forward calorimeters (including the transition!), the forward region shielding, etc. In the three options investigated, these are in varying degrees of opposition, and they are strongly affected by other components of the detector, such as the beamline. We now describe the design options.

**ATLAS Baseline Design**

The details of the description of the ATLAS Baseline simulated here were taken from various sources. For global detector information, our primary sources have been the ATLAS L.O.I. (October, 1992), transparencies from the 'ATLAS plenary meeting of 10 September, 1993', and the 'Progress Report on ATLAS Milestones' of 15 October, 1993. This design is pictured in Figures 1a, 1b, 1c, and 1d. Below we describe geometry specifications used for each subsystem in more detail:

**Inner Detector.** The design currently in the Arizona description was obtained from Michal Seman (Columbia University) in September of 1993. It is one of the several designs which were being considered at that time, and is not one of the two current ATLAS options in DICE (Cosener's layout or Panel layout). However, the material distribution of this September design is sufficiently similar to the current ones that no attempt was made to improve it for the current studies, which are focussing on forward calorimetry and the muon system. This design will be updated as time permits. The central region has a 2.0 Tesla solenoidal field.

**Barrel Calorimeter.** The materials and radial dimensions in the barrel calorimeter are identical to those now in DICE. They were established at a geometry meeting during the ATLAS week beginning January 31st, 1994. This includes the materials and dimensions beginning with the solenoid cryostat wall at \(r=1150mm\), the solenoid, the standard preshower, EM accordion, the scintillating hadronic calorimeter, and the structural sections at the outside of the calorimeter. In our description, structures such as the preshower are homogenized into mixtures instead of appearing as individual layers. The end treatments of the barrel EM accordion are taken from ma chine drawings which are less than two weeks old. The 500 \(mm\) electronics gap in the hadronic calorimeter near \(\eta=1.4\) is filled with a mixture of 10% G10, 30% stainless steel, and 60% void. This is probably too much iron, and the mix will be made more realistic before the next runs. (The neutron flux from this channel may be underestimated in the current studies.)

**Endcap Calorimeter.** The endcap calorimeter dimensions and cryostat design have been taken from an Orsay drawing of the same period (late January, 1994). The inner edge of the calorimeter modules lies along \(\eta=3.2\). The endcap hadronic module dimensions and materials are taken from the copper design (Canada) discussed in calorimetry meetings during that ATLAS week. The calorimeter modules lie along an inner edge which is projective, but the cryostat walls around the beam are cylindrical, creating a space inside the cryostat. It is assumed that this space is occupied by excluder rather than liquid argon. The warm cryostat wall facing the beam is aluminum, thinned to 7 \(mm\), and the cold wall is stainless steel, of the same thickness. There are a couple of peculiarities with this endcap cryostat which should be mentioned. This design is shorter (in z) than those in earlier detector drawings, by roughly 300 to 500 \(mm\). In the current studies, this was put to advantage by packing the space behind the cryostat with additional shielding to protect the first muon chamber. Unfortunately this shorter design created a jam where the electronics feedthroughs would exit the cryostat at the outer rear corner. The most recent designs from Orsay show the cryostat elongated again by about 300 \(mm\), but with shielding ('masse metalique') inside the liquid argon at the rear of the last hadronic module. This shielding will have some of the desired effect in protecting the muon chamber from the direct flux of punchthrough particles. But the endcap rear cryostat walls are now closer to the first muon chamber, and since these act as a neutron channel, things may be worse than is shown in the current simulations. The simulation also deviates from the Orsay design by making the cryostat back walls thinner near the beam, where they are no longer shadowed from the I.P. by the hadronic modules. This additional material at high \(\eta\) will appear in the upcoming simulation. It will act as a secondary source of neutrons, aggravating the neutron flux problem in the first muon chamber. It will also degrade the performance of the high pressure gas forward calorimeter. The net result of these differences is that the current study is for a 'kinder, gentler' baseline than is actually being engineered at present. The new geometry will be entered and studied to find out if the differences are serious or not.

**Forward Calorimeter.** The forward calorimeter has the placement and dimensions of the envelope of the high pressure gas design. Its front face sits at 15000 \(mm\) from the I.P. It is a mixture of stainless steel and void, with a density of 6.7 \(g/cm^{2}\). Being a homogeneous mixture, it has none of the seams and dead regions of the actual design, so quantities such as the \(P_{t}\) resolution do not contain this additional source of fluctuation. The bore of the forward calorimeter contains the copper collimator for the final focus quadrupoles.

**Muon Region.** There are no realistic materials in the muon region. The whole region is filled with air. The barrel and forward chambers and the forward toroid are all made of air. The forward toroid has magnetic field. The barrel toroid is absent. Materials in this region will be made more realistic in future runs. It is not obvious how to characterize this region with \(\phi\) symmetric mixtures, since most of the material is lumped and structural. It is also not clear that this lumped material will cause much reduction of the neutron fluences.

**Experimental Hall.** The experimental hall is modelled as concrete, located at the nominal positions shown in various ATLAS drawings.

**Beamline.** The beam design has been based on ATLAS drawings and on conversations with Hans Hoffman and Lars Leistam. There is a beryllium pipe in the central region, a very realistic flange of several pieces at about 1000 \(mm\) from the I.P., then a 120 \(mm\) diameter aluminum pipe with 1.2 \(mm\) walls running to the front of the forward calorimeter, where it tapers to join the 30 \(mm\) diameter machine pipe. There is a small flange at approximately 5000 \(mm\), and pump and gate-valve pairs at about 8000 \(mm\) and 14000 \(mm\). The pump in each pair is 35 \(kg\) of stainless steel and the gate-valve, 10 \(kg\) of aluminum. These pumps and valves act as secondary sources, and are strong contributors to the neutron flux in the forward region muon chambers.

**Forward Region Shielding.** The forward region shielding placements and thicknesses closely follow those used by Alfredo Ferrari in his FLUKA studies of the ATLAS baseline, and are about the best one can do in the ATLAS baseline, given the space constraints. The inner boundary of the forward toroid cold mass was placed along the \(\eta\) ray at 2.8. This leads to a muon chamber coverage up to approximately \(\eta=2.6\), which muon proponents may consider inadequate. The inner boundary of the shielding cone is placed at \(\eta=3.0\), so that the endcap calorimeter edge at 3.2 shadows it. The shielding is two-layer. The layers nearest the beam and against the back of the endcap cryostat are realistic iron (2% carbon), and the outer layer in each case is barite-concrete.

**ATLAS Baseline with Reduced Forward Cone: \(\eta\)=3.6**

It is clear from the pictures and description of the baseline that there are interactions among the various items in the forward region. The muon coverage cannot be extended without pushing the toroid cold mass to higher \(\eta\). This in turn thins the radiation shield unless it is pushed to higher \(\eta\)which causes the endcap calorimeter transition to be at higher \(\eta\). These considerations lead to the second option simulated: similar to the baseline, but with the endcap calorimeter transition pushed to \(\eta\)=3.6. This approach has been advocated by Peter Norton as a method for improving the muon coverage, and our realization of this idea is pictured in Figures 2a, 2b, 2c, and 2d. Many of the parts of this design are the same as the baseline, so we here list only the differences:

**Endcap Calorimeter.** The calorimeter modules envisioned for the baseline endcap probably cannot be pushed much beyond an \(\eta\) of 3.2 because of the dual problems of radiation damage to electrode structures and positive ion buildup in the liquid argon gaps. We propose here that the best way to push this calorimeter transition to higher \(\eta\) is to change the technology of the modules at \(\eta\) = 3.2 to the thin-gap tube design described in references 2 and 3. These tube modules are radiation and rate resistant, and are denser than the modules below \(\eta\) = 3.2, so the total calorimeter depth in \(\lambda\) can be maintained within the length of the endcap hadronic section alone. The new 'tube liner' section then extends to an \(\eta\) of 3.6. The endcap cryostat details are similar to those in the baseline (with the same caveats associated with cryostat length and wall thicknesses).

**Forward Calorimeter.** The forward calorimeter in this option stays the same distance from the I.P., but its radius is reduced compared to the baseline. The exact amount depends on the margin allowed in matching the endcap to forward coverage, but our rough estimate is that the forward calorimeter tonnage would be reduced by about a factor of 2.

**Muon Region.** In this option, the toroid cold mass inner boundary has been placed at \(\eta\) = 3.0, implying muon chamber coverage to about 2.8.

**Forward Region Shielding.** The conical portion of the forward region shield is thickened considerably compared to the baseline. The inner boundary is now placed at \(\eta\) = 3.5 to allow for shadowing by the tube liner edge at 3.6. No change is made to the shielding against the back of the endcap cryostat. Again, this configuration is similar to those simulated by Ferrari in his studies (with a calorimeter inner edge at \(\eta\) = 3.5).

**ATLAS with Integrated Forward Calorimeter**

The third option we have simulated evolves from the baseline with \(\eta\) transition at 3.6 by pushing the thin-tube modules in the endcap to as high an \(\eta\) as possible, as shown in Figures 3a, 3b, 3c, and 3d. The standard beampipe, along with cryostat structures brings the active edge of the tube calorimeter front corner to \(\eta\) = 4.98, giving an effective coverage to \(\eta\) = 5.0, the same as the coverage of the far forward calorimeter in the baselinedesign. This 'integrated' design was the concept studied and chosen in the GEM detector. Of course the detector surroundings and physics criteria are somewhat different in ATLAS, so the option must be studied from scratch along with the others.

**Endcap/Forward Calorimeter.** In the integrated design, the coverage to highest \(\eta\) is entirely in the endcap, and the far forward calorimeter is not needed. The thin-gap liquid argon tubes are absorbing the radiation and rate at the highest \(\eta\) edge. HOWEVER, flux conservation causes the total activation as a function of \(\eta\) to be the same, to first order, in the far-forward and integrated designs. The activation density is higher in the integrated design, but for safety considerations the critical factor is the radiation rate from the detector surface at some distance from that surface. The hottest parts of the integrated forward calorimeter can be easily shielded for handling with small amounts of lead because the activation is localized. The effect of this activation on calorimeter signals is negligible in all options.

**Beamline.** The beamline design in this option is radically different from the other two because the region behind the integrated forward calorimeter is no longer in the calorimeter fiducial volume, so there is much more freedom for placing beamline structures and services. Two things occur naturally. With the forward calorimeter face now a factor of three closer to the I.P. the beamline material is reduced. This reduction factor is large since the massive pumps and valves are now behind the forward calorimeter instead of in front of it. The other nice effect is that if the beam pipe is flared behind the calorimeter, it is shadowed from the I.P. and is no longer a secondary source feeding the neutron flux in the muon region. By the same token, all pumps and other beam services may be placed in the shadowed region. The larger beampipe also helps the pumping speed. The first effect, reduced material in front of the calorimeter, improves the \(P_{t}\) resolution. The second, no material near the beam between the calorimeter and the quad collimator, is the first major step in protecting the forward muon chambers.

**Muon Region.** In this study, the toroid shape and muon coverage are the same in the integrated option as in the baseline with transition at \(\eta\)=3.6. There is the possibility of pushing the muon coverage even higher in the integrated design, and this can be explored as time permits.

**Forward Region Shielding.** The forward region in the current study has been shielded about as heavily as one might imagine in terms of available space, but this is just a first attempt, and the choice and placement of materials is surely not yet optimized in this design. A copper collimator just downstream of the integrated forward calorimeter scrapes the glow emanating from the back of the calorimeter. Its edge is at 4.9. The largest diameter cone of beampipe runs along \(\eta=4.4\), and the shielding begins at 4.3, with iron, as usual, and barite concrete on the outside. The final focus quad collimator still resides near the location of the previous far forward calorimeter, and requires careful shielding, along with the quad itself. Note that though these shielding pieces in all designs are large, they need not be single pieces mechanically. We envision them being sectioned for easier installation. Leif Shaver at the University of Arizona is considering these issues of of installation and access in the integrated design.

### Dead Material Distributions

The calorimeter response to electromagnetic and hadronic showers is affected by dead material in front of the calorimeter, dead material in the midst of the calorimeter, and calorimeter depth. The dead material distributions in the forward region are different for the three options. The first few absorption lengths are shown as a function of \(\eta\) for the three options in Figures 4a, 4b, and 4c. Live calorimeter or preshower depths are shaded dark and dead materials are white. Figures 5a, 5b, and 5c show the radiation length distributions as a function of \(\eta\).

The material distributions for the baseline and design with calorimeter transition at \(\eta\) = 3.6 look very similar, except for the shift of cryostat inner walls to higher \(\eta\) in the latter design. Also evident at high \(\eta\) are the pumps and valves associates with the beamline. The integrated design has considerably less material on average through the region from \(\eta\) = 3.0 to 5.0 and it is more evenly distributed. What is not evidence from these types of plots is the spatial arrangement of the materials. As we shall see, the long distance between much of the dead material and the front face of the forward calorimeter in the first two designs leads to severe degradation of the \(P_{t}\) resolution at high \(\eta\).

### Pion Response as a Function of \(\eta\)

For particle response and jet calculations, GEANT 3.15 is used, with GHEISHA for hadron showers and the GEANT EGS based parameterizations for electromagnetic showers. Default GEANT cuts are used since the geometries simulated here have 'large' features and the mixture volumes are fully sampling.

In the current studies, 200 GeV/c pions were randomly generated over an \(\eta\) interval from 0.0 to 7.0. For calorimeter studies such as this, calorimeter modules and the preshower are treated as sensitive volumes, and the rest are treated as dead material. In each sensitive volume, a running three vector sum of the deposited energy DESTEP is accumulated. If the particle is an electron, positron, or photon, it is classified as electromagnetic. All other particles are classified as 'hadronic'. These two classes of energy are summed separately for each volume.

Each 'event' corresponds to a single incident pion. At the end of each event, the hadronic energy is boosted by a factor to make each sensitive volume act as if it were a compensating detector. This factor is slightly material dependent, but is usually close to 2.0. If we were to sum the EM and hadronic energy in the module at this point, we would have the response of a fully sampling, compensated calorimeter module, subject only to nuclear binding loss fluctuations. Instead, the hadronic energy is multiplied again by \(1/(e/h)\) for each module. This factor varies between about 1.1 and 1.9 for different modules, and has been gotten from testbeam runs, from detailed GEANT simulations, or by estimation. At this point, the summed energy would represent the response of a fully sampling non-compensating module. Instead, the electromagnetic and hadronic energies are separately fluctuated by Gaussian smearing factors which simulate the sampling fluctuations (stochastic term) for this type of module. Finally, the energy is summed to represent the response of the module. All of these procedures are described in greater detail in reference 1.

In the current study no additional constant term or noise term smearing is done. It is easy to add these by simply throwing the corresponding software switch. (Noise and pileup may only be done properly if segmentation is enabled as well.) But the intent of the present investigation is to concentrate on the resolution degradation caused by (1) nuclear binding loss fluctuations, (2) \(e/h\) effects, (3) dead material energy loss fluctuations, (4) longitudinal containment fluctuations, and (5) energy centroid mismeasurement caused by spray from one part of the detector into another ('\(P_{t}\) crossover'). Note that several of these effects will induce a constant term, and it is important to know the magnitude of this 'irreducible' constant term before additional detector inhomogeneities are taken into account.

We characterize the detector response with diplots of \(P_{t}/sin(\theta)\) vs. \(\eta\) observed. These contain a lot of information, so as a guide to interpretation we give the following generic example: Figure 6a shows the total momentum (\(P\)) response of a perfect calorimeter with coverage to \(\eta=5.0\). The diplot is populated along a line \(P=P_{inc}\) out to \(\eta=5.0\), where the response goes to zero. The \(P\) response of a more realistic calorimeter might look like Figure 6b. There are now fluctuations due to nuclear binding losses, and the mean is lowered by dead materials and longitudinal losses. In detector transition regions, these losses, and the increased fluctuations due to them, are quite pronounced. In addition, events are smeared in \(\eta\) in some regions because the observed \(\eta\) is differing from the generated \(\eta\) due to particle'spray' within the calorimeter. It is assumed that \(\eta\) dependent calibration constants will take out the wander of the mean, but they do nothing to improve the resolution or to fix the \(\eta\) mismeasurement. Finally, Figure 6c shows \(P_{t}/sin(\theta)\) vs. \(\eta\) observed. This should look similar to \(P\) diplot, except that at high \(\eta\) the angular resolution of the calorimeter becomes critical, and dominates the determination accuracy. As a result we see additional smearing at large \(\eta\) if the angular measurement is inadequate.

The comparison of \(P_{t}/sin(\theta)\) vs. \(\eta\) observed for 200 GeV/c pions is made in Figures 7a, 7b, and 7c for the three design options. Recall that all three designs are the same up to an \(\eta\) of 3.0. The first dip in these distributions occurs at \(\eta=1.2\). Most of this is due to the 500 \(mm\) electronics gap in the hadronic scintillating calorimeter. In this case the dip may be 'calibrated away' by an \(\eta\) dependent gain constant because the distribution remains fairly Gaussian, with a shift of the mean. But the \(P_{t}\) resolution is made worse in this region by the dead material of the electronics wheel.

In the ATLAS baseline design (Figure 7a), there are several features at higher \(\eta\) which have more serious consequences for the physics. The endcap calorimeter ends at \(\eta=3.2\). Between there and \(\eta=4.0\), there is cryostat wall material. Particles will spray from the inner edge of the calorimeter and from the cryostat walls into the far forward high pressure gas calorimeter, registering energy in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) cells where it does not belong. This spray occurs in all designs at all transitions, but what makes the effect particularly bad in this case is the _lever arm_ in the material distribution. That is, the face of the forward calorimeter being 10 meters downstream from the source of the spray magnifies the effect of this '\(P_{t}\) crossover'. The envelope of the fluctuations in the range of \(\eta=3.2\) - 4.0 looks no worse than the shift caused by the electronics wheel. But note that in this higher \(\eta\) region the R.M.S. of the distribution is actually widened, and that the distribution is non-Gaussian. There are indications of two classes of showers in the diplot in this region. Simple gain constants adjustments will not remove this effect.

The beamline material is also a problem. In the baseline, the beampipe is in front of the far forward calorimeter from the I.P. to the face of the calorimeter for 15 meters. More seriously, the pumps and gate valves introduce material starting at \(\eta=4.4\) comparable to the cryostat structures at lower \(\eta\). Once again, this material has long lever arm, and the spray from pions interacting in the pumps and valves spreads considerably before reaching the calorimeter, where it is mismeasured.

The other thing happening in the baseline design beyond \(\eta=3.2\) is the appearance of long tails in the \(P_{t}\) distribution, to both sides of the mean. It is not possible from this plot alone to tell if these tails will have a serious effect on the missing \(E_{t}\) distribution. To find the answer, either full events must be generated and propagated through GEANT, or the tails of the distribution must be parameterized so that particle level studies may be done. The former gives the exact answer, but takes weeks (perhaps months) of computer time to develop the required statistics at high missing \(E_{t}\), and the latter requires great care in getting these rare fluctuations parameterizedcorrectly. Because these fluctuations are large, there is no quick answer to this missing \(E_{t}\) question.

For many physics processes, it is the high energy tails which are most troublesome. For example, in compositeness searches one looks at the the s-ingle jet inclusive \(P_{t}\) spectrum or the dijet mass spectrum. Excesses of events at the high energy end of these spectra are taken as indications of compositeness. Since the spectra fall rapidly in \(P_{t}\), high energy fluctuations of low momentum jets can "feed up' to distort the high energy spectrum. [Note that the current simulation does not include all possible sources of rare high energy tails. At some point it will be important to include realistic module behavior from testbeam run measurements. For example, if the scintillating hadronic calorimeter modules are detecting particles in the wavelength shifter, they may exhibit high energy tails which have serious consequences for the physics. Testbeam data plots should be binned so that all events are visible.]

The final problem region in the baseline design lies beyond the calorimeter edge at \(\eta=5.0\). The final focus quadrupole collimator in the bore of the high pressure gas forward calorimeter is intercepting particles, and the hadronic showers are spreading into the sensitive volume of the calorimeter, appearing as a 'crescent' or 'ring' around the beam hole. The reconstructed \(\eta\) thus falls outside the active edge of the calorimeter, but the resulting \(P_{t}\) is very poorly measured relative to the incident value. There is a lot of energy in this tail at high \(\eta\). The effects on physics benchmarks are again hard to quantify without full simulation, but the magnitude of this mismeasurement is larger than any other on the plot, so the degradation in performance could well be serious.

Figure 7b shows the same plot for the ATLAS baseline with the calorimeter transition at \(\eta=3.6\). The cryostat structures have shifted to higher \(\eta\), but the region beginning at \(\eta=3.2\) is still disturbed because now there are two calorimeter transition edges instead of one. And the response at \(\eta=4.0\) looks a bit worse than in the comparable transition in the baseline design. The beamline is the same here as in the baseline, as is the bore of the forward calorimeter, so these parts are smeared as before.

Figure 7c shows the response when the forward calorimeter is integrated into the endcap. This curve is much closer to that of an ideal calorimeter. The long tails extending to high and low \(P_{t}\) at high \(\eta\) have disappeared. The transition from endcap to forward modules at \(\eta=3.0\) is barely visible in terms of smearing. The short distance between the front of the endcap and the forward calorimeter has shrunk the lever arm by almost a factor of 10. The empty bore of the calorimeter (no quad. collimator) makes the edge close to ideal.

Since it is difficult to extract numbers from the diplots of \(P_{t}/sin(\theta)\) vs. \(\eta\) observed, the means and R.M.S. of the each \(\eta\) slice are calculated and displayed in Figures 8a, 8b, and 8c for the three designs. The error brackets in these diplots are the R.M.S. of the distribution in \(P_{t}/sin(\theta)\) for each \(\eta\) bin, and _not_ the error on the determination of the mean. The final set of plots in this series; Figures 9a, 9b, and 9c; shows \(dP_{t}/P_{t}\) (the R.M.S. divided by the mean) as a function of \(\eta\) for each design. As was evident from the original scatter plots, the \(P_{t}\) resolution of the integrated design is better than the other two options at high \(\eta\). It is also clear in these plots that the useful coverage of the integrated design extends to higher \(\eta\) than the other two options, even though the calorimeter edges occur at the same \(\eta\). This is the effect of the differences in dead material depth and spatial arrangement in front of the calorimeter.

**Photon Response as a Function of \(\eta\)**

Beyond an \(\eta\) of 3.0 to 3.2, there is no intent to detect single photons or electrons with any precision. The purpose of calorimetry in the forward region is to identify jets efficiently and resolve their \(P_{t}\) well, and to provide coverage to high \(\eta\) so that the event \(E_{t}\) may be measured. In both of these measurements, the electromagnetic energy will be a major component, and in the jet measurement this component contributes most strongly to the accurate determination of jet angle. This is one of the advantages of longitudinal segmentation in the calorimeter. The first depth of the calorimeter, where the prompt EM energy in the jet is sampled, may be used for the angle determination. The other use of longitudinal segmentation is in jet weighting, to recover linearity and resolution degraded by dead materials and \(e/h\) effects. Each of these tactics buys some improvement, but they cannot be used to correct gross mismeasurement effects, and they have not been used in the current simulations since we simulating single particles, not jets.

Figures 10a, 10b, and 10c show the \(P_{t}/sin(\theta)\) photon response to 50 GeV/c photons for the three options considered. The response in the barrel region should be 'ignored' for now. The energy plotted in this region is the simple sum of energy in the calorimeter modules and in the material of the preshower. _No weighting procedure using the preshower detector has been applied._ Because of the large quantities of dead material in front of the calorimeter in this region, this procedure makes a big difference for photons (but not for the pions of the previous study). i.e., one should not compare the resolution numbers in the barrel in these plots of photons with the resolutions coming from the ATLAS simulation groups optimizing EM resolution in the barrel. We simply have not gone to the trouble to weight the results. Beyond the barrel, the these photon plots are more realistic. If we compare these plots with the corresponding pion plots we see that the very low and high \(P_{t}\) tails at high \(\eta\) are not present. The tighter collimation of EM showers

improves the angular resolution in the forward direction and reduces the energy spreading effect. But other forms of mismeasurement are still there. There are 'wiggles' in the photon \(P_{t}\) response in the first two options at high \(\eta\), requiring complex gain correction. And the containment edge near the beam is once again importing energy (and the attendant \(P_{t}\) fluctuations) from the quadrupole collimator in the first two designs. Again, the integrated design has a response curve which is close to ideal.

Figures 11a, 11b, and 11c show the means and R.M.S. vs. \(\eta\) for 50 GeV/c photons in the three design options. Figures 12a, 12b, and 12c show \(dP_{t}/P_{t}\) for the previous plots. The integrated design has equal or better resolution at all \(\eta\) and a slightly higher useful \(\eta\) containment at the beam edge for this electromagnetic energy.

### Neutron and Photon Fluences

Now we turn to the issue of radiation in the muon chambers and the inner detector. Particle fluence calculations are done with GEANT 3.16, using the GCALOR interface to CALOR for low energy neutron transport. The GCALOR interface was written and tested by Christian Zeitnitz at the University of Arizona (now at the University of Mainz), in collaboration with Tony Gabriel, of Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This interface was used extensively in GEM and SDC, and is being used by various groups for CMS and ATLAS neutron fluence calculations. High energy hadron transport is carried out by the GEANT resident FLUKA code. CUT's used with GCALOR are lowered to the following values: GAM = 10 keV, ELE = 1 MeV, NEU = 10\({}^{-14}\) GeV, HAD = 1 MeV, MOU = 1 MeV, BCUTE = 10 keV, BCUTM = 200 keV, DCUTE = 1 MeV, DCUTM = 1 MeV. And the timeout is TOFMAX = 1000 seconds to allow thermal neutrons to propagate.

The minimum bias events used in these calculations are from a file of 1000 DTUJET events with PP incident at 7 TeV on 7 TeV. This file was obtained from Yuri Fisyak in October, 1993. The DTUJET events correspond to the PP total inelastic crossection, which yields 20 events per crossing, with 25 nanoseconds between crossings, at an LHC luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

Fluences are calculated by accumulating track lengths for each particle type of interest in small volumes which are pixel bins in z-\(\rho\) and wrap around all \(\phi\) (tori). At the end of the run, dividing this accumulated track length in each bin by the corresponding volume of the bin gives the density of tracks per \(cm^{2}\). The time for the run is calculated from the number of DTUJET events and the event rate of 0.8 GHz. The fluence is then found by dividing by this time, and converting to units of KHz/\(cm^{2}\). A color scale spanning eight orders of magnitude is set up, and the pixels are displayed in these colors.

Figures 13a, 13b, and 13c show the neutron fluences for the three design options for one full quadrant of the experiment. The end wall of the experimental hall is visible, but the side wall is just outside the picture. The labelled units along the z and \(\rho\) axes are meters, and the z-\(\rho\) pixel size is 10 \(cm\) by 10 \(cm\). The areas to study on these plots are the muon chamber regions. In going from the baseline to the design with the transition at \(\eta\) = 3.6, there is only minor reduction in the neutron fluence in the forward chambers. The shielding is thicker than in the baseline, but pushing the toroid and chambers to higher \(\eta\) has lost some of what was gained with the additional shielding. As will become more obvious in the photon and charged particle plots, the pumps and valves along the beamline near 8 and 14 meters are secondary sources feeding the neutron flux in the forward region. The integrated design, on the other hand, has a dramatic reduction of neutron fluence in the muon chambers. At the hottest corner of the first forward chamber, the reduction is one order of magnitude, and over the w-hole chamber volume, it is between 1.5 and 2 orders of magnitude reduction. Thicker shielding and the repositioning of pipes, pumps, and valves to areas in the shadow of the integrated forward calorimeter, have combined to give the desired effect.

Since we also must monitor neutrons in the inner detector, we have analyzed this region in greater detail. Figures 14a, 14b, and 14c show the inner detector and calorimeter at higher resolution, with z-\(\rho\) pixels of 3 \(cm\) by 3 \(cm\). Studying these plots closely shows that the neutron fluence contours in the inner detector are identical in all three designs. The only precaution which has been taken to achieve this is to thicken the borated polyethylene in front of the new forward calorimeter section relative to the other sections. Elsewhere in the inner detector, this shield is 5 \(cm\) thick in all designs. Beyond \(\eta\) = 3.0 it is thickened to 20 \(cm\). This has not been optimized, and it is possible that it could be made thinner. This stability of inner detector neutron fluence with respect to rather dramatic changes in the forward region is consistent with the behavior seen in GEM and SDC studies of the inner detector.

To show that we are observing the expected thermal neutron peak and low energy photons, Figures 15a and 15b show neutron and photon spectra scored into a small strip 800 \(mm\) from the beamline in the inner detector volume. These are not normalized. We have also compared neutron fluences with those being calculated by Yuri Fisyak and by Alfredo Ferrari in similar ATLAS geometries, and find general agreement among the results.

Large photon fluences in the muon chambers are a problem induced by the copious fluence of neutrons. Photon fluences are shown for the three designs in Figures 16a, 16b, and 16c. As expected, these follow the general pattern of behavior of the neutrons. Once again, there is slight improvement in going from the baseline to the second design, and more than one order of magnitude improvement in going to the integrated design.

### Charged Particle Fluences

Muon triggering can become a problem if the rate of charged particles punching through the calorimeter or the beamline shielding gets too high. For this reason we have tallied the charged particle fluences as well. Figures 17a, 17b, and 17c shows these results for the three design options. In the first two designs the action of the beamline pumps and gate valves as secondary sources is obvious. These charged particle rates look quite high to us, and the changes from design to design are similar to what is found for neutrons and photons. If anything, the improvement brought about by the integrated design is greater in this case. (These plots need to run for more events than the earlier ones to smooth the contours.)

Special attention should be paid to the innermost corner of the first forward muon chamber. In these charged particle plots, it is clear that there are particles coming both through the beamline shielding and through the calorimeter. In the first two designs, the former source dominates. In the integrated design, the two sources may be close to being in balance. _The rates will get much worse in this corner if the shielding against the back of the endcap calorimeter is thinned._ Recall that the calorimeter designs for the endcap cryostat have gotten longer recently, and either this shielding will have to get thinner, or the first chamber will need to move back by the same amount. We don't have a solution to this potential problem, but would like to raise a flag of warning about this region.

### Ionization Dose Rates

For dose calculations, we have taken a nominal LHC run year to be \(10^{7}\) s. Since dose is in units of deposited energy per unit mass, we begin by accumulating the step energy divided by the density of the tracking medium in each step. At the end of the run, dividing these accumulations in each bin by the bin volume puts the results in units of GeV/kg. Conversion factors are applied to express the results in Gray/run-year or MRad/run-year (shown here). Figures 18a, 18b, and 18c show the doses accumulated in one quadrant of the experiment per year, and Figures 19a, 19b, and 19c show the doses in the inner detector, barrel, and endcap calorimeter regions (with the same high magnification as in the neutron plots).

A few general observations may be made. The ionizing radiation doses in the hottest parts of the forward calorimeter in any of these designs tend to be in the range of 100 to 1000 MRad/run-year in the vicinity of EM shower maximum. These are the rates we have been expecting to see, based on earlier simulation work in GEM and SDC. The thin-gap tube forward calorimeter proposed for the integrated design has been developed to operate at the high ionization rates found in these regions and to resist radiation damage at these doses. The thin gap prevents the positive ion buildup in the liquid argon from distorting the electric field as it would in standard gap devices (see references 4 and 5). The materials to be used in the tube design are all radiation damage resistant to the level of \(10^{5}\) MRad or more. In summary, we expect the thin gap tube design to operate comfortably in this environment.

### Work in Progress

There are several directions in which simulation work will be progressing:

1) Higher statistics will be collected in those plots where the contours could be improved.

2) The new endcap calorimeter cryostat designs will need to be followed closely and simulated.

3) Tradeoff studies will be needed to optimize the shielding materials and placement.

4) Activation analysis of some type will be undertaken. With the codes available, all that may be possible is to try activation estimates based on star densities-which usually agree only to within factors of 2 to 5 with activation codes such as CINDER. The best way to proceed in this direction is not yet clear. As noted earlier, the activation problems in all designs will be similar since the flux inducing it is conserved. Only the placement and density change, and activation density is not the critical parameter for safety. Self-shielding effects and surface locations are more important.

### Summary

Optimization of the ATLAS forward region is a complex problem in a space of many parameters. We have shown that is possible to make significant gains in reducing muon detector radiation levels while maintaining inner detector radiation levels at baseline values. The integrated design we have investigated also improves \(P_{\rm f}\) resolution and coverage. We do not anticipate problems in this design with activation, installation, or access compared with the other designs, but these issues await further simulation and design development.
