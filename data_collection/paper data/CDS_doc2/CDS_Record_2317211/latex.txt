Prospects for the \(\mathcal{B}(B_{(s)}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) measurements with the ATLAS detector in the Run 2 and HL-LHC data campaigns

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note estimates the ATLAS detector performance in measuring the branching fractions of the very rare decays \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(B^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) using data collected during the whole LHC Run 2 campaign and during the whole HL-LHC campaign. The estimation is obtained by means of pseudo-MC experiments based on the measurement of the two processes performed by the ATLAS experiment using the full integrated luminosity collected during the Run 1 data taking campaign.

## 1 Introduction

This note documents a simulation-based study of the confidence regions for the search for very rare decays \(B^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) using the statistics to be collected in Run 2 and HL-LHC with the ATLAS detector [1]. Both processes are flavour-changing neutral-current (FCNC) mediated and therefore highly suppressed in the SM, nevertheless their branching fractions have been accurately predicted [2]: \(\mathcal{B}(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=(3.65\pm 0.23)\times 10^{-9}\) and \(\mathcal{B}(B^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=(1.06\pm 0.09)\times 10^{-10}\). The measurement of the two branching fractions is relevant to indirect searches for physics beyond the Standard Model [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11], therefore these processes are a flagship in B-physics analyses.

The present studies are based on the latest result from the ATLAS collaboration regarding this search, which is based on the data collected during Run 1 [12].

## 2 Extrapolation Procedure

The analysis sensitivity is expressed with expected \(BR(B_{d}\to\mu\mu)\) - \(BR(B_{s}\to\mu\mu)\) contour plots centred at the SM expected value for these processes. These contour plots are obtained predicting the expected statistics relative to the Run 1 analysis, and then running the same fitting and toy-MC machinery used for the Run 1 result. The yield extrapolation is performed for the total expected Run 2 yield, and then for 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of HL-LHC integrated luminosity.

All sensitivities are obtained assuming as central value the SM expectation [2]. Offline analysis selections and reconstruction efficiencies are assumed to be the same as the published Run 1 result, while yields are corrected for different center of mass energy, trigger selections and integrated luminosities. The S/B ratio is assumed to be the same as the Run 1 analysis, since the analysis selection variables make it very robust against pile-up (thanks e.g. to vertexing quality and pointing angle requirements), and the dominant source of background after the final analysis selection is from heavy flavour decays. The HL-LHC ATLAS tracker upgrades [13, 14] entail improvements in vertex and mass determination, partly enhanced by the increased muon trigger momentum thresholds. While the decay length resolution improvements are neglected in favor of a conservative S/B assumption, the signal mass resolution variations are taken into account when assessing the analysis sensitivity. This variation is assessed using HL-LHC simulations: figure 1 ([13]) shows the comparison of signal width obtained from Run 2 simulations to the one obtained simulating HL-LHC detector and collision conditions. The substantial improvement in mass resolution reflects in an improved signal statistical significance and separation of \(B_{s}\to\mu\mu\) and \(B_{d}\to\mu\mu\) decays, as demonstrated in section 6.2.

The expected Run 2 confidence level bands need to be derived (due to the low-statistics regime of this analysis) using a profiled likelihood ratio Neyman belt construction. As the sample statistics increases, the fit likelihood maximum approaches asymptotic Gaussian behaviour, closely reproducing the two-dimensional Neyman construction contours. This approximation is exploited to reduce the computational burden of the results.

The HL-LHC extrapolations are expected to be sufficiently well approximated with likelihood contours. The full Run 2 extrapolation is a pivotal point in this study, justifying the asymptotic approach used in confidence band extraction for the HL projections.

In order to determine the \(BR(B_{d}\to\mu\mu)\) - \(BR(B_{s}\to\mu\mu)\) confidence regions, the expected signal yield is obtained through the following expression:

\[\begin{split}\text{(projected signal statistics)}&=\text{(Run 1 signal statistics)}\times\frac{\text{(projected B cross-section)}}{\text{(Run 1 B cross-section)}}\\ &\times\frac{\text{(projected Luminosity)}}{\text{(Run 1 Luminosity)}}\times\frac{\text{(projected trigger efficiency)}}{\text{(Run 1 trigger efficiency)}}.\end{split} \tag{1}\]

Where the B production cross-section scale factor we use assumes, conservatively, that Run 1 data have been all collected at a center of mass energy of 8 TeV.

Each of the ratios in equation 1 are quantified in sections 4 and 5.

### Systematic uncertainties

The Run 1 analysis parametrizes two classes of systematic uncertainties: the ones coming from external inputs (e.g. the \(f_{s}/f_{d}\) ratio and the \(B^{+}\to J/\psi[\to\mu\mu]K^{\pm}\) branching ratio) and those depending on internal analysis effects (invariant mass fit shapes, efficiencies, etc.). The latter category is parameterized as a function of the signal yields where dependencies are found to be significant.

Figure 1: Reconstructed \(B_{s}\to\mu\mu\) mass spectrum for muons with \(|\eta|<2.5\). For reference, the \(B_{d}\) mass value [15] is shown as a dotted line. HL-LHC and Run 2 are compared. The figure shows the mass resolution using only the ID/ITk track parameter measurement, evaluated at the fitted B-vertex.

This study extrapolates the same systematic uncertainties including the same signal yield parameterization found in the Run 1 studies. As for the external sources of systematic uncertainties, it is plausible to expect that these will be reduced with other measurements and could optimistically scale for the most part like statistical uncertainties. This study however conservatively assumes their values to be those used in the Run 1 analysis.

## 3 Run1 cross-check

Since this study re-implements in the Run 2 \(B\to\mu\mu\) analysis framework the same techniques employed in the run 1 analysis, the ATLAS Run 1 analysis is reproduced first. Like for the Run 1 publication, contour plots are obtained as profiled likelihood contours, with a central fitted value consistent with the Run 1 analysis. To this effect, a mock dataset similar to the real Run 1 data sample is generated using toy simulations and then fit with the same fitting technique used in Run 1. The resulting contours are compatible with the ones obtained in Run1 with real data.

## 4 Extrapolation to full Run 2 statistics

The three main ingredients of equation 1 are computed as follows:

1. **B production cross section with respect to Run 1**: due to the Run 2 increased center of mass energy a value \(\sim 1.7\) times higher is expected, according to studies performed using FONLL [16].
2. **The expected collected luminosity for the selected triggers in Run 2**: we assume \(130\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) as the total Run 2 integrated luminosity. Similar trigger conditions as the ones present in 2017 are projected to 2018.
3. **The efficiency of the dimuon triggers available in Run 2 with respect to the Run 1 triggers**: these have been calculated exploiting \(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) MC simulations for the Run 2 data-taking conditions.

In order to compute the relative Run 2/Run 1 trigger efficiency, simulated signal events were fully reconstructed and the same preselections as the Run 1 analysis [12] were applied. All efficiencies are normalized to the 4 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) dimuon (2MU4) trigger selection, with the Run 2 dataset assumed to be collected with an admixture of triggers extrapolating to 2018 data-taking the same trigger selections and prescales implemented in 2017.

These ingredients predict a 7-fold increase with respect to Run 1 statistics.

## 5 Extrapolation to HL-LHC statistics

The prediction of the HL-LHC \(B\to\mu\mu\) signal yield is based on equation 1, taking into account 3 \(\mathrm{ab}^{-1}\) of expected integrated luminosity and the triggers foreseen by [17]:1. **B production cross section with respect to Run 1**, any further increase in the enter of mass energy relative to Run 2 is neglected, conservatively assuming the same \(\times 1.7\) factor as for the Run 2 extrapolation.
2. **expected collected luminosity for the selected triggers at HL-LHC**, an integrated luminosity of \(\approx 3\)ab\({}^{-1}\) (\(3000\)fb\({}^{-1}\)) is assumed to be collected during the whole HL-LHC data taking period;
3. **efficiency of the dimuon triggers available at HL-LHC with respect to the Run 1 triggers**, the HL-LHC signal trigger efficiencies have been calculated exploiting the same MC simulations used in section 4. The pile-up conditions in these simulations differ from what expected for HL-LHC, but this is irrelevant when assessing truth-matched signal efficiencies. Based on the prospective triggers foreseen in [17], we explore different dimuon transverse momentum thresholds (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu_{1}},p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu_{2}}\)): (6 GeV, 6 GeV), (6 GeV, 10 GeV) and (10 GeV, 10 GeV).

Depending on these dimuon trigger thresholds, three working points are inferred:

* Conservative: \(\times 15\) Run 1 statistics;
* Intermediate: \(\times 60\) Run 1 statistics;
* High-yield: \(\times 75\) Run 1 statistics.

## 6 Results

### Run 2 Contours

A two-dimensional Neyman construction [18] based on likelihood ratio ranking is used to identify the 68.3%, 95.5% and 99.7% confidence level regions for the combined measurement of \(\mathcal{B}(B_{s}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) and \(\mathcal{B}(B^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\). Pseudo-MC experiments are used in the Neyman construction procedure and to verify the coverage.

Figure 2 compares the Neyman-construction based Run 1 and Run 2 confidence regions and the Standard Model theoretical prediction with its uncertainty [2]. Systematic uncertainties are included in both sets of contours.

As introduced in section 2, at the level of full Run 2 statistics the behavior of the likelihood function is expected to be almost asymptotic. This is shown in figure 3, where 68.3%, 95.5% and 99.7% (stat+syst) confidence regions constructed with Neyman belt and and the asymptotic likelihood approaches are compared: consistency is very good for the 68.3% contour, and progressively deviates from gaussianity (with inconsistencies at the level of 15-20%) at larger \(\Delta\log L\). This is due to the progressively less adequate Gaussian approximation of the Likelihood maximum. These residual non-gaussianities decrease at the higher statistics projected for HL-LHC, therefore allowing the \(\Delta\log L\) contour approach to be sufficient for HL-LHC extrapolations.

The effect of systematic uncertainties is illustrated in Figure 4. This figure shows the 2D Neyman belt based Run 2 extrapolated confidence regions and the Standard Model theoretical prediction with its uncertainty. The dominant systematic uncertainty is coming from the \(f_{s}/f_{d}\) ratio and fit shape uncertainties, affecting predominantly or exclusively \(BR(B_{s}\rightarrow\mu\mu)\), and therefore resulting in a 'rotation' of the measurement ellipsoid to be more parallel to the x-axis.

### HL-LHC Contours

Section 6.1 indicates that with the statistics expected in the HL scenarios considered the profiled likelihood contours sufficiently well approximate the expected analysis performance.

Two different sets of likelihood ratio contours corresponding to 68.3%, 95.5% and 99.7% probability are obtained, with and without systematic uncertainties. All working points described in section 5 are considered and result in the contours illustrated in figures 5, 6 and 7.

In Table 1 we compare the profiled likelihood uncertainties separately for the \(\mathcal{B}(B_{s}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) and \(\mathcal{B}(B^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) measurements, at the various data taking points discussed in the previous paragraphs. Statistical uncertainty uniformly decreases with statistics as expected, while systematic uncertainties show a distinct behaviour for \(B_{s}^{0}\) (\(f_{s}/f_{d}\) dominated) and \(B^{0}\) yields.

Figure 2: Comparison of the 68.3% (solid), 95.5% (dashed) and 99.7% (dotted) stat.+syst. confidence regions for the Run 1 statistics (blue, outermost) and the extrapolated Run 2 statistics (red, innermost). The confidence regions are obtained with the 2D Neyman belt construction, based on pseudo-MC experiments and the Run 1 analysis likelihood. The Run 2 pseudo-MCs reproduce the expected signal mass resolution and have been scaled with respect to their Run 1 counterpart according to the triggers available in Run 2, the different integrated luminosity and the different B production cross section. The black point shows the SM theoretical prediction and its uncertainty [2].

## 7 Conclusions

A detailed study of th ATLAS experiment reach in the search for rare decays of \(B^{0}_{s}\) and \(B^{0}\) into oppositely charged muons is presented. The study is based on the results of the analysis performed on the data collected during Run 1 of LHC, and takes into account several aspects of the extrapolation such as e.g. trigger selections and efficiencies, detector performance effects, luminosity and collision energy conditions.

Systematic uncertainties are extrapolated from the Run 1 analysis, without assumptions on the evolution of external sources of systematic uncertainties such as \(f_{s}/f_{d}\) and the BR of the reference channel. Extrapolations of the statistics available in the datasets to be collected during Run 2 and HL-LHC are performed and the confidence regions for Run 1, Run 2 and HL-LHC statistics are obtained. The extrapolations take into account different mass resolution performances of the configurations considered as well as the effect of different trigger selections and signal and background yields dependencies on the collision center of mass energy.

Figure 3: Comparison of the 68.3% (solid), 95.5% (dashed) and 99.7% (dotted) stat.+syst. confidence regions for the extrapolated Run 2 statistics. Red contours are obtained exploiting the 2D Neyman belt construction based on pseudo-MC experiments, while blue contours are drawn at constant \(\Delta\log L\) in the gaussian maximum approximation. The Run 2 pseudo-MCs reproduce the expected signal mass resolution and have been scaled with respect to their Run 1 counterpart according to the triggers available in Run 2, the different integrated luminosity and the different B production cross section. The black point shows the SM theoretical prediction and its uncertainty [2].

This study reports also in table 1 the projected uncertainties on the individual \(B_{s}\) and \(B_{d}\) branching ratios for the scenarios considered.

Figure 4: Comparison of 68.3% (solid), 95.5% (dashed) and 99.7% (dotted) confidence level contours obtained exploiting the 2D Neyman belt construction for the Run 2 case. Red contours are statistical only; blue contours include systematics uncertainties from the ATLAS Run1 analysis [12] extrapolated to Run 2 statistics. The Run 2 pseudo-MCs reproduce the expected signal mass resolution and have been scaled with respect to their Run 1 counterpart according to the triggers available in Run 2, the different integrated luminosity and the different B production cross section. The black point shows the SM theoretical prediction and its uncertainty [2].

The results are centred on the SM theoretical prediction [2]. For each extrapolation performed, statistical and statistical+systematic uncertainties are reported in units of \(10^{-10}\). These values can be compared with the combined Run 1 measurement of CMS and LHCb [19]\(\mathcal{B}(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=(2.8^{+0.7}_{-0.6})\times 10^{-9}\), \(\mathcal{B}(B^{0}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=(3.9^{+1.6}_{-1.4})\times 10^{-10}\) and the latest 2015+2016-data LHCb result [20]\(\mathcal{B}(B^{0}_{s}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=(3.0\pm 0.6^{+0.3}_{-0.2})\times 10^{-9}\). The table reports a sufficient number of significant digits to highlight the difference between statistical+systematics and systematics-only uncertainties.
