###### Abstract

This note describes a method to extract the EM calorimeter parameters from Z boson decays into electrons. Assuming an integrated luminosity of 10 \(\mbox{fb}^{-1}\), the absolute mass scale can be determined with a relative precision of \(2.10^{-5}\), and the expected precision on the average mass resolution is 0.2%. Exploiting the electrons energy distribution, the detector linearity can be controlled with a precision of 1.9 \(10^{-4}\) for electron energies above 20 GeV. The energy dependence of the resolution is measured accurately, providing 0.6% precision on the sampling term, and 3% precision on the calorimeter global constant term. With this accuracy, the related uncertainty on the W boson mass measurement is 4 MeV, using the EM calorimeter only.

## 1 Introduction

The extraction of clean signals in ATLAS (for both discovery physics, and high-statistics precision measurements) obviously requires precise in situ calibration of the different detector sub-systems. A first goal is to ensure that the different regions of the detector respond identically, so that events from a given process can be treated coherently, independently of where they are measured. Once a clean signal sample is accumulated, its final interpretation, in particular the signal mass, then relies on a precise knowledge of the detector energy scale.

The precision requirement on the mass measurement of a new or known signal depends on the context in which it is to be interpreted. The Standard Model, for example, is not very sensitive to the Higgs boson mass, as compared to the top quark and W boson masses (\(\delta m_{t}/m_{t}\sim 10^{-2},\delta m_{W}/m_{W}\sim 2.10^{-4}\), and \(\delta m_{H}/m_{H}\sim 0.3\) are roughly equivalent). Distinction between supersymmetric models however requires a relative precision on \(m_{H}\) of about \(10^{-3}\).

The most stringent requirement is probably \(\delta m_{W}/m_{W}\). With an accumulated luminosity of 10 \(\mbox{fb}^{-1}\), the expected statistical precision on \(m_{W}\) (measured through its transverse mass spectrum, or through the transverse momentum distribution of its decay lepton) is 2 MeV [1]. This sets a natural target for the final precision, including systematic uncertainties. One of the primary systematic uncertainties is indeed the absolute energy scale [2].

This note presents a method that exploits the Z boson lineshape to determine the energy scale, and control its linearity and resolution. In the next section, the event selection is briefly described, and a method is presented that determines the scale and resolution on the complete sample passing the selections. Results and limitations are discussed. Following that, the samples are categorized according to the lepton energies, and the scale and resolution are computed in each sub-sample; this measures the energy dependence of the detector parameters. Consequences for physics measurements are then given.

Below, we denote by "mass scale" a scale determined from an invariant mass distribution, and averaged over the decay particles energy spectrum. The "energyscale" really refers to the lepton energy (i.e. not the dilepton invariant mass). The lepton energy spectrum in Z boson decays gives access to the energy dependence of the energy scale, i.e. the linearity.

Although the methods presented here are quite general, details depend on the expected form of the detector resolution function. Throughout this note, we take the specific example of Z \(\rightarrow\) ee events, measured in the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter.

## 2 Mass scale and Resolution

This section presents a method to determine the mass scale of a detector using a known reference, namely the Z boson mass peak measured through its decay into electrons.

Around the Z peak, the dielectron invariant mass spectrum results from numerous effects; mainly the Z boson mass and width, interference between Z and photon exchange, the parton-parton luminosity (structure functions), and QED corrections (radiation in decay). Consequently, the spectrum has no simple analytical expression, and one has to rely on Monte Carlo simulations to determine the lineshape. Determining the mass scale then means to correct for imperfect detector simulation by scaling the measured spectrum to the simulated one, so that when measuring the Z boson mass in this sample, the known value comes out by construction.

Note that the simulation of the lineshape carries some uncertainty, namely from the parton-parton-luminosity and from the QED corrections. Both effects skew the measured invariant mass distribution, and this skewing could wrongly be absorbed into the absolute scale. Disentangling these effects is important but reserved for further study, and all physics parameters are assumed perfectly known in the present note.

We start by remarking that resolution effects induce a shift in the measured value of a mass peak. Hence, since the simulation of the detector resolution is \(a\ priori\) imperfect as well, it is necessary to determine both scale and resolution simultaneously. We then summarize the method employed to this end, and illustrate its expected performance.

### Correlation between Scale and Resolution

Suppose one wants to measure the mass \(M_{0}\) of a heavy particle (of negligible width) decaying into two electrons. We assume \(M_{0}\simeq M_{Z}\), and statistics allowing an expected uncertainty of \(\delta M_{Z}\simeq 2\) MeV. The system is at rest, so one has \(M\ =\ 2\sqrt{E_{1}E_{2}}\), where \(E_{1}\) and \(E_{2}\) are the electron energies, measured in a calorimeter with gaussian resolution \(\sigma_{E}=a\sqrt{E}\). The resulting distribution of \(M\) is gaussian to a very good approximation.

Figure 1 shows the position of the most probable (and central) value of \(M\) as a function of the parameter \(a\), describing the calorimeter resolution. One observes a large shift compared to the precision one wishes to achieve: taking \(a\simeq 0.1\), as expected in the ATLAS EM calorimeter, the bias is 5 MeV; taking \(a\simeq 0.5\) (expected in the Tile calorimeter), the bias is 125 MeV. Consequently, extracting the physical mass from a fit to the measured distribution would lead to a wrong result.

A correct method is to compare the measured distribution to Monte Carlo "simulations" of the distribution of \(M\), obtained by varying the underlying mass \(M_{0}\). One can for example use binned \(\chi^{2}\) comparisons; the result is then obtained from the Monte Carlo sample giving the smallest \(\chi^{2}\). From Figure 1 however, a necessary condition is that the calorimeter resolution in data and simulation are identical; if not, a bias results. It is thus necessary to vary the resolution function as well, and measure the mass and resolution simultaneously.

Conversely, if \(M_{0}\) is very well known and used as an absolute reference to scale the detector response, the mass scale and resolution should in principle be measured simultaneously.

An analytical derivation of the result of Figure 1 can be found in [3].

### Simultaneous determination of the parameters

We apply the above to the case of Z boson decays to electron pairs in ATLAS. We define a set of "template simulations" of this process, obtained by varying the mass scale and resolution, and a sample of "pseudo-data" with fixed values of these parameters.

Both the pseudo-data and template simulations are obtained by requiring both electrons to be reconstructed in the electromagnetic precision calorimeter (\(|\eta|<2.5\)), be well identified, and satisfy \(p_{T}>20\) GeV. The dielectron invariant mass should satisfy \(85<M_{ee}<97\) GeV.

We take the fully simulated "Rome" Z \(\rightarrow\) ee sample [4] as our pseudo-data. The event generation relies on HERWIG 6.4 and CTEQ5 LO structure functions; second order photon emission in the Z boson decays is performed using PHOTOS. The events are reconstructed with ATHENA 10.0.4. The above cuts have an efficiency of 32%, and provide 30700 events.

We obtain template simulations using the same generator settings and starting from the Monte Carlo truth. The electrons are first recombined with any photons emitted at angles smaller than \(4^{\circ}\) (for smaller angles, the photon does not produce a separate cluster in the large majority of events, see Fig. 2).

The events are subsequently smeared and scaled using various parameters. The

Figure 1: Bias in the peak position of \(M~{}=~{}2\sqrt{E_{1}E_{2}}\), as a function of the resolution parameter \(a\).

calorimeter resolution function is taken to be \(\sigma_{E}=a\sqrt{E}\), with \(a\) varying between 0.1 and 0.25 in 50 steps (no constant term is assumed at this stage). For every value of \(a\), the scale parameter \(\alpha\) is varied between 0.99 and 1.01 in 50 steps. We thus obtain a grid of 50\(\times\)50 simulation templates, and for each template use \(10^{7}\) events to determine the mass distributions.

The measured invariant mass \(M_{ee}\) is histogrammed between 85 and 97 GeV, using 50 bins. A \(\chi^{2}\) is then computed between the pseudo-data and each template simulation sample, leading to a set of triplets \(\{\chi^{2}_{i},\alpha_{i},a_{i}\}\) (see Figure 3). This set can be well fitted by a paraboloid function \(\chi^{2}=f(\alpha,a)\), and the preferred values, their uncertainties and correlation are obtained by analytical computation:

\[\left.\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial\alpha\partial a}\right|_{\alpha_{0},a_{0}}=0 \tag{1}\]

gives the preferred values \(\alpha_{0}\) and \(a_{0}\);

\[f(\alpha,a)=f(\alpha_{0},a_{0})+1 \tag{2}\]

gives the 68% CL (elliptic) contour; the horizontal and vertical tangents to the ellipse give the standard deviations \(\delta\alpha\) and \(\delta a\), and the angle \(\phi\) of its major axis, through

\[\tan 2\phi=\frac{2\rho_{\alpha a}\,\delta\alpha\,\delta a}{(\delta\alpha)^{2}-( \delta a)^{2}}, \tag{3}\]

gives the correlation \(\rho_{\alpha a}\) between \(\alpha\) and \(a\). This procedure is illustrated in Figure 4.

### Results and Performance

Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the result of the above algorithm applied to the "Rome" \(\rm{Z\to ee}\) data. The calorimeter resolution parameter is found to be \(a~{}=~{}0.142\pm 0.003\), which results from the local calorimeter resolution, averaged over the angular distribution of the decay leptons. The mass scale is found to be \(\alpha=1.0038\pm 0.0002\)

which corresponds to the decalibration factor found on the "Rome" single electron samples [5]. This provides an independent check of the method.

Figure 5 gives a comparison of the lineshape obtained on "Rome" fully simulated data with fast simulation results. The standard ATLFAST smearing parameters lead to a clear disagreement, which is recovered using the parameters resulting from the fit. The quality of the agreement in this case is satisfactory, both in the peak and in the tails of the distribution.

Figures 6 and 7 give the expected precision on \(\alpha\) and \(a\) as a function of the size of the collected Z \(\rightarrow\) ee sample (the corresponding integrated luminosity is computed assuming an inclusive Z production cross-section \(\sigma_{Z}\)=60 nb). The scale parameter can be known with a relative precision better than \(\simeq 2.10^{-5}\) (corresponding to a precision \(\leq\)2 MeV on the peak position) within 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). The resolution parameter \(a\) is determined with a precision of \(2.10^{-3}\) with the same data.

To illustrate again the correlation between the scale and resolution parameters, a series of one-parameter fits have been performed on large sets of fast-simulated pseudo-data (taking \(\alpha_{0}=1\) and \(a_{0}=0.2\) as an example). Fixing the resolution parameter \(a\) to various values around \(a_{0}\), \(\alpha\) is repeatedly fitted, and the bias \(\mathrm{d}\alpha=\alpha-\alpha_{0}\) is mapped as a function of the mismatch \(\mathrm{d}a=a-a_{0}\). The resulting curve is displayed on Figure 8, and is a straight line over a large fraction of the interval. The slope of this line gives again the correlation factor, which numerically coincides with the value found on the fully simulated data (see Figure 4). As a result, the scale is biased by \(2.10^{-5}\) (corresponding to 2 MeV) for every 0.01 mismatch on \(a\). When \(a\) tends towards 0, the bias becomes slowly constant: the small resolution effects play no role and the lineshape is dominated by the Z boson width, as can be expected.

### Limitations

As stated in Section 2.2, the high-statistics used in this analysis seem to require a histogram-based method and a parabolic fit to discrete \(\chi^{2}\) points. For this to provide sufficient precision, and in order to limit the needed number of template simulations, the sensible range in \(\alpha\) and \(a\) needs to be fairly well understood (to a few percents) before application of this method.

Besides, the \(\chi^{2}\) behaviour is parabolic only in reasonably close vicinity of the true value of the parameters. This is particularly true for the resolution parameter: at small values of \(a\), the lineshape is given essentially by the natural Z boson width, and varying \(a\) does not affect the lineshape anymore.

Most importantly, the scale parameter determined above is determined at \(M_{Z}\), and using only the dilepton invariant mass information (i.e. averaging over the lepton energy spectrum and angular distribution). It is thus not clear how to apply this parameter to other processes. For example, measuring another dilepton resonance at a different mass poses the question of the linearity (i.e. mass dependence) of the mass scale; also, measuring the mass of the W through its leptonic decays requires that one can identify the dilepton mass scale and the lepton energy scale, and that this scale is independent of energy.

## 3 Energy Scale and Linearity

This section discusses the control of detector linearity, and the determination of its complete resolution function. The method used is described in [6], where it was applied to the intercalibration (in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) regions) of the Atlas EM calorimeter.

Reproducing the analysis above as a function of energy indeed allows to determine an energy-dependent scale (i.e. control the linearity), and the energy dependence of the resolution. This last point improves over Sect. 2.2 by eliminating any hypothesis on the form of the resolution function. The method and its expected performance are reviewed below.

The present method requires higher statistics than the previous one, and the "Rome" sample is insiffucient. In the following, we take as pseudo-data a sample of generation-level Z \(\rightarrow\) ee events equivalent to 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), fast-simulated with various scale and resolution parameters.

### Method

We divide the energy spectrum of leptons from Z boson decays in N equal intervals between a threshold \(E_{min}\) and a value \(E_{max}\) above which no significant statistics are expected. Every event then falls in a category \((i,j)\), where \(i\) and \(j\) correspond to the energy intervals respectively including the first and second lepton.

The pseudo-data are separated into categories as above, and simulation templates are generated for every category, varying again mass scale and resolution. The method of Sect. 2.2 is applied for each \((i,j)\), leading to energy-dependent mass scales \(\beta_{ij}\) and resolution parameters \(a_{ij}\), as well as their uncertainties \((\delta\beta)_{ij}\) and \((\delta a)_{ij}\).

The mass scale parameters \(\beta_{ij}\) are related to the energy scales \(\alpha_{i}\) via \(\beta_{ij}=(\alpha_{i}\alpha_{j})^{1/2}\); when the decalibrations are small, \(\beta_{ij}\approx(\alpha_{i}+\alpha_{j})/2\). The linearity is obtained from the \(\beta_{ij}\) by computing the \(\alpha_{i}\) using least squares. Let \(B_{i}\) and \(U_{ij}\) be

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:10]

### Performance

To test the method, several energy-dependent scales and resolution functions have been injected into the pseudo-data, and reconstructed using the above method. The energy bins are defined as intervals of 5 GeV, for electron energies between 20 and 140 GeV; all electrons with energy between 140 and 300 GeV are gathered in a last bin.

Assuming an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), the scale parameters are reconstructed with a precision of 1.9 \(10^{-4}\) (i.e. the \(\alpha\) residuals have an RMS of 1.9 \(10^{-4}\)). Figure 9 illustrates the result for a particular injected function of the form:

\[\alpha(E)=a-b\exp(-E/c). \tag{15}\]

which resembles what one expects if e.g the passive material in front of the calorimeter has been underestimated. The quoted precision improves as expected when the luminosity increases; at constant luminosity, the precision scales roughly as \(\sqrt{N}\). The fact that the electron energy can be considered constant within the energy intervals (as the method assumes, see Eq. 8) is not obvious a priori. The energy-independent method has also been applied on this sample, leading to a constant scale. This scale is represented as a horizontal line on Figure 9.

With the same luminosity assumtions, the resolution function is reconstructed in the following way. A function of the form:

\[\sigma(E)/E=a/\sqrt{E}+b \tag{16}\]

is injected in the pseudo-data, with \(a=0.12\) representing the average detector sampling term, and \(b=0.007\) the global (long range) constant term. The reconstructed points are illustrated in Figure 10. It is legitimate to assume the same functional form to fit the points; doing this, \(a\) is reconstructed with a relative precision 0.6%, and the relative precision on \(b\) is 3%. A form as obtained from the energy independent method (also displayed in Figure 10) is strongly excluded.

In both cases, the last bin (\(E_{e}>140\) GeV) plays a crucial role, fixing respectively the asymptotic value of the scale, and the constant term of the resolution function. Removing this point results in a degradation of the precision on the fitted parameters by a factor 2 to 3.

## 4 Applications

This section discusses the implications of the above results on the measurement of heavy particles masses. According to the precision achieved, \(\delta m_{H}/m_{H}\sim 10^{-3}\) seems well within reach from the point of view of electron measurements. We therefore focus on the measurement of \(m_{W}\), and propagate the scale uncertainty using two methods described below.

### Assuming chaotic scale variations

The first method takes the result litterally, and assumes that true variations of the detector scale do occur within 5 GeV energy intervals, with a spread of 1.9 \(10^{-4}\). We can then compute the impact of such variations on the measurement of \(m_{W}\) by performing toy measurements, using the electron transverse momentum as observable, perfectly linear simulation templates (varying \(m_{W}\)), and pseudo-data at fixed \(m_{W}\), but containing non-linearities as above.

Figure 9: Injected energy-dependent scale (dashed line), and reconstructed values (points with error bars). A function has been fitted through the points for illustration (full line). The result from an energy-independent fit is also displayed (dot-dashed line).

Figure 10: Injected resolution function (dashed line), and reconstructed values (points with error bars). A function of the form \(\sigma(E)/E=a/\sqrt{E}+b\) has been fitted through the points (full line). The result from an energy-independent fit, assuming the form \(\sigma(E)=a\sqrt{E}\), is also displayed (dot-dashed line).

For every toy measurement, we inject energy-dependent factors (from a gaussian distribution around 1, with spread 1.9 \(10^{-4}\), independently in each energy bin) in the electron \(p_{T}\) spetrum, perform the fit, and collect the bias on \(m_{W}\). An example of this procedure is illustrated in Figures 11 and 12.

Repeating this exercise 100 times, we verify that the distribution of the bias is approximately gaussian, compute its spread, and use it to define the systematic uncertainty on \(m_{W}\) from imperfect energy scale and linearity. The result is \(\delta m_{W}=3\) MeV. This procedure is illustrated in Figure 13.

This procedure was also repeated for various values of \(\Delta\alpha\), namely \(1.10^{-3}\), \(2.10^{-3}\), and \(5.10^{-3}\) (worse precision corresponding to lower integrated luminosity). A linear dependence of \(\delta m_{W}\) on \(\Delta\alpha\) is observed, and \(\Delta\alpha=0\) implies \(\delta m_{W}=0\), as expected.

Finally, we apply the same procedure, however injecting non-linearities in energy intervals of 1 and 10 GeV. This represents the impact on \(\delta m_{W}\) of performing the Z \(\rightarrow\) ee analysis in corresponding energy intervals. As can be expected, for a given value of \(\sigma_{\alpha}\), the uncertainty increases when the energy intervals are wider. However, for a given integrated luminosity, the determination of \(\sigma_{\alpha}\) improves when the number of energy intervals decreases. When both effects are taken into account, the \(\sigma m_{W}\) dependence on the width of the energy intervals is weak (at least for intervals up to 10 GeV). This discussion is summarized in Figure 14.

Note that if we assume, as above, that the detector has chaotic scale variations on short distances, a necessary consequence is the appearance of accidents (steps, spikes) in otherwise smooth energy spectra. Such features should be easily detected in the data.

### Assuming smooth scale variations

We now assume that the calorimeter behaviour should be smooth on small energy variations. In this case, the energy-dependent scale will be represented by an ad-hoc function fitted through the points, as in Figure 9. This fit should satisfy \(\chi^{2}/dof\sim 1\), and have residuals \(\sim 1.9\ 10^{-4}\). If these conditions are satisfied, the systematic un

certainty \(\delta m_{W}\) then comes from the uncertainties on the ad-hoc function parameters and their correlations.

The detailed results of the fit of Sect. 3.2 are as follows. The fitted values of the parameters and their uncertainties are \(a~{}=~{}1~{}\pm~{}2,6.10^{-5},\,b~{}=~{}0,0077~{}\pm~{}0,0006\), and \(c~{}=~{}22,35~{}\pm~{}1,13\). The parameters have significant correlations, namely \(\rho_{ab}~{}=~{}-0.432\), \(\rho_{ac}~{}=~{}0.637\) and \(\rho_{bc}~{}=~{}-0.943\). To obtain a set of parameter values representing the uncertainty on the fitted function, we define:

\[Y=\mu+S\,X, \tag{17}\]

where \(X\) is a vector of three gaussian random numbers, centered at 0 and with standard deviation 1; S is a triangular matrix satisfying \(S^{\,t}S=C\), the covariance matrix of the parameters; \(\mu\) is the vector of central values for (a,b,c). The components of \(Y\) are distributed according to the parameters central values, uncertainties, and correlations, as illustrated in Figure 15.

As in the previous section, we perform toy-measurements with perfectly linear templates, and inject non-linearities in the pseudo-data. The non-linearities are represented by the function of Eq. 15, with parameters distributed as described above. For every toy measurement, we collect the bias on \(m_{W}\), and use the spread of the bias distribution as contribution to the systematic uncertainty. The result of this procedure is \(\delta m_{W}=4.2\) MeV, as illustrated in Figure 16.

## 5 Perspectives

We conclude this study by recalling the context of the present discussion, in terms of detector calibration and a precise measurement of the W mass. Future improvements to the analysis are mentioned.

### Detector calibration in situ

It is shown above that a consistent analysis of the Z boson lineshape allows to control the EM calorimeter scale, linearity, and its resolution function to high precision.

Figure 14: Spread of the bias on \(m_{W}\), as a function of the residual non-linearities.

Figure 15: Distributions of a, b, c and their correlations obtained from the procedure of Eq. 17.

The calorimeter sampling term varies rapidly as a function of the electron pseudorapidity. Extending the analysis to treat independently the different \(\eta\) regions will give additional insight, allowing to map the full detector resolution function. This would actually result in merging the present study with the analysis of [6]. This aspect is reserved for future study.

The Z \(\rightarrow\) ee process is of course only one among many other ways to infer the detector performance. It requires high statistics, and other methods like analysing the E/p distribution of inclusive electrons will provide results with much less data. For calibration purposes, it is however important to decouple the detector subsystems as much as possible, and using a physical resonance to constrain independently the detectors involved in the measurement of its decay particles will provide optimal performance.

The present method could in principle be extended to control the scale and resolution of the Inner Detector and the Muon Spectrometer, after obvious adaptations to the specificities of these detectors (e.g the form of the expected resolution function). Application to the determination of the photon scale, using the process Z \(\rightarrow\) ee\(\gamma\), is planned.

### Backgrounds

We do not quantify the impact of backgrounds in the present note. Backgrounds are expected to be small under the Z resonance, but a detailed study is certainly necessary when aiming at high precision. We briefly discuss physical and experimental backgrounds below.

The process Z \(\rightarrow\tau\tau\) can give two electrons in the final state. The expected rate is 1% of the Z \(\rightarrow\) ee rate, due to the \(\tau\rightarrow\) e\(\nu_{e}\) branching fraction. Selecting events within the mass window \(85<M_{ee}<97\) reduces the rate by an additional two orders of magnitude, leading to a contamination of about \(10^{-4}\). The effect of this background can be bounded by the result of including such events in the pseudo-data and ignoring them in the templates. It can subsequently be reduced, if

Figure 16: Distribution of the bias on \(m_{W}\), from the exercise described in the Sect. 4.2. The spread of the bias is 4.2 MeV.

necessary, by measuring this background in the data (on independent samples) and including it in the templates.

High-p\({}_{T}\) electrons from heavy flavours should be accompanied by energetic jets, and this contamination should be kept under control by jet vetos and cuts on electron isolation. Experimental backgrounds (jet or hadron mis-identification) also occurs. Electron identification cuts are expected to provide a rejection of about \(10^{5}\) against jets; for dielectron events, the rejection is \(10^{10}\).

The above arguments indicate that the backgrounds could be kept under sufficient control. A detailed study is necessary, but reserved for future work.

### W mass measurement

The current consensus about the LHC W mass measurement potential states that a precision of 20 MeV can be reached. The main sources of systematic uncertainty are currently believed to be the imperfect knowledge of QED radiation in the final state, proton structure functions, and detector energy scale and resolution, each roughly contributing 10 MeV [1].

The present study shows that the last source can be controlled to a level of 4 MeV. This number can still be improved if one considers that it corresponds to an integrated luminosity of only 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), and that only the calorimeter has been considered. In the case of electrons, the same analysis could be performed with the inner detector, where a similar precision should be achieved. Combining both numbers will allow to verify the consistency of the analyses, and bring additional improvement. Note that the absolute lower bound on this source is 2 MeV, which corresponds to our knowledge of the Z boson mass. When approaching this regime, one can imagine increasing correlation between the W and Z mass measurements.

## 6 Summary

We reiterate the main results of this study.

The absolute mass scale of a detector is determined by adjusting its simulated response, so that a well known physical reference measured in the data (the Z boson lineshape, measured through its decay leptons) is precisely reproduced by the simulation. With 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), the mass scale and the detector resolution are measured with a relative accuracy of \(2.10^{-5}\) and \(2.10^{-3}\), respectively.

If only the lineshape is exploited, the above exercise is not very useful. Indeed, this simple procedure averages over the angular and energy distributions of the decay leptons, so that the obtained result is in fact specific to the studied process. Extrapolation to other processes is not straightforward.

Exploiting the energy distribution of the leptons allows to determine the energy dependence of the scale and of its resolution. On the example of the ATLAS EM calorimeter, we showed that the detector linearity can be controlled to high accuracy: when energy intervals of 5 GeV are used, the scale can be determined with a precision of 1.9 \(10^{-4}\) between 20 and 140 GeV. The resolution function is extracted with a relative precision of 0.6% on the sampling term, and 3% on the global constant term. The dependence of the performance on the choice of the energy interval was studied. The optimal interval should result from a compromise between statistical precision, and sensitivity to short-distance effects.

As an application of these results, the induced systematic uncertainty affecting the W-mass measurement was evaluated and found to be 4 MeV, using the EMcalorimeter only. This number will improve with increasing luminosity, when combining the EM calorimeter and the Inner Detector within the \(\mathrm{W}\to e\nu_{e}\) channel, and finally the \(\mathrm{W}\to e\nu_{e}\) and \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\mu\nu_{\mu}\) channels.
