Introduction

The calorimetry of ATLAS [1] consists of an EM calorimeter (Pb/LAr) covering the pseudorapidity region \(\left|\eta\right|<3.2\), a barrel hadronic calorimeter (Fe/Scintillator) covering \(\left|\eta\right|<1.7\) and an end-cap hadronic calorimeter (Cu/LAr) covering \(1.5<\left|\eta\right|<3.2\). The forward calorimeter covers \(3.1<\left|\eta\right|<4.9\). The various calorimeters have different degrees of non-compensation and the unavoidable presence of dead material makes the task of jet energy measurement very difficult. In this note simple and well known methods are used at each step in order to understand all the ingredients of the jet reconstruction chain from first principles. The main goal is to explore methods to restore the uniformity of the response by estimating the energy lost in dead material with the informations from the extrascintillators, by interpolation and by making use of the granularity of the detector. Hopefully it can also help those readers, completely new to the subject, to get some insight in the problem of jet reconstruction and energy evaluation.

## 2 Detector geometry

For many reasons it is desirable for a calorimeter to be perfectly homogeneous; however, due to practical and economical reasons this is not possible in a detector like ATLAS. Important factors are dead material in e.g. the cryostats, coils and unavoidable cables and beam pipes. One extremely critical region is e.g. the corner where \(EM\) accordioends at \(\eta=1.45\) (see Figure 1 and Figure 2).

A very detailed description of the detectors and dead material is provided by DICE, the GEANT3 based detector simulation [2] (see Figure 1). The inner tracking detector is also included in the simulation. The information from the tracks is not explicitly used but the effects of the 0.5-1.0 radiation lengths of material, e.g. conversions and electron bremsstrahlung, are included in the simulation. The tracker of course plays a vital role e.g. in \(b\) and \(\tau\) jet tagging and the information of the momenta of the charged tracks belonging to a jet could contribute to a better energy measurement, but this question is not addressed here.

A direction inspace at vertex is specified by the boost invariant variables \((\phi,\eta)\), where \(\phi\) is in the cylindrical symmetry direction, and \(\eta\) is the pseudorapidity. \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\), where \(\theta\) is the angular deviation from the beam axis.

The EM calorimeters have a very fine granularity optimized for EM shower measurements, whereas the granularity of the hadronic calorimeter, 0.1x0.1 in \(\eta\)x\(\phi\), is adapted to the size of a hadronic shower.

For jet reconstruction the standard strategy is to project the energy from the calorimeter cells into towers of 0.1x0.1 in \(\eta\)x\(\phi\).

## 3 Calorimeters within pseudorapidity \(\left|\eta\right|<1.7\)

In the analysis presented in this note, the various calorimeters are chosen to be grouped into the following compartments, the acronyms represent the sum of the digitized energy from that compartment:

\(EM_{B}(E_{1j})\) : Liquid argon electromagnetic barrel accordio: the same weight is applied to all three longitudinal segments (also the 4th small segment at \(\eta=1.5\) is included);Figure 1: GEANT volumes defining the ATLAS calorimetry. Version 98-2. The outer radius of the Tile calorimeter is 4.2 meters.

\(|\eta|<1.475\); \(EM_{E}(E_{2j})\) : the liquid argon electromagnetic endcap; all segments included; \(1.375<\eta<3.2\); \(HAD_{B}(E_{3j})\) : the Tile hadronic iron-scintillator barrel; all 3 segments included; \(|\eta|<1.0\); \(HAD_{X}(E_{4j})\) : the Tile hadronic iron-scintillator extended barrel; all 3 segments included; \(0.8<\eta<1.7\); \(HAD_{E}(E_{5j})\) : the liquid argon hadronic endcap; all segments included; \(1.5<\eta<3.2\). The optimized weighted sum of these energies is referred to as \(E_{calo}\) and represents the estimated energy from the jet algorithm using the calorimeters only.

## 4 Complementary energy estimators for calorimetry

Beside the non compensation, i.e. electromagnetic and hadronic processes not giving the same response in the calorimeter, the major cause for performance degradation is the energy lost in the dead material \(E_{dead}\) (see Figure 2). Dead material \(m_{dead}\) is defined as absorbing material that is not sampled. Its effect will depend on the location, e.g. if situated close to the shower maximum or not. The effect is also strongly dependent on the event topology, e.g. single particles like pions or wider object like jets. In ATLAS the design has been optimized such as to concentrate as much as possible of the dead material in a small interval at \(|\eta|=1.45\). To reduce the effect of the dead material, one can use estimators of the energy loss such as the ones used in this study:

\(PS_{B}(E_{6j})\) : the single layer LAr presampler to sample showers initiated in the inner tracker, inner cryostat walls and the coil; \(|\eta|<1.52\); \(CRYO_{B}(E_{7j})\) : the geometric mean between the last layer in \(EM_{B}\) and the first layer in \(HAD_{B}\) estimates energy lost in the outer cryostat wall; \(|\eta|<1.0\); \(PLUG_{1}(E_{8j})\) : the Intermediate Tile calorimeter ITC 1 in the barrel and extended barrel crack; \(0.8<|\eta|<0.9\); \(PLUG_{2}(E_{9j})\) : ITC 2; \(0.9<|\eta|<1.0\); \(SCIN_{1}(E_{10j})\) : the scintillator extension of the ITC in the barrel and extended barrel region; \(1.0<\eta<1.2\); \(SCIN_{2}(E_{11j})\) : \(1.2<|\eta|<1.4\); \(SCIN_{3}(E_{12j})\) : \(1.4<|\eta|<1.6\); \(PS_{E}(E_{13j})\) : the single layer LAr presampler to sample the concentration of material in the corner between \(EM\) barrel and \(EM\) endcap. \(1.5<|\eta|<1.8\); \(CRYO_{E}(E_{14j})\) : the geometric mean between the 6th,7th and 8th segment in \(EM_{E}\) and the first layer in \(HAD_{X}\) to estimate the energy in the endcap cryostat wall; \(1.2<|\eta|<1.475\).

Figure 2: Energy lost indead material. Jets are mostly a mixture of pions. The energy lost by \(\pi^{0}\) is shown in the upper left figure and the one by \(\pi^{+}\) in the upper right one. The vertical error bars represent the actual RMS of the distribution, not the error of the mean. One sees that the dead material is concentrated in a small window of about 0.2 in \(\eta\) at \(|\eta|\)=1.45. For charged pions, there are two components, the dead material in front of the calorimeter and the dead material between the EM and HAD calorimeters due to the outer cryostat wall. In the barrel there are larger fluctuations on the hadronic energy loss due to the fluctuation of the starting point of the hadronic shower.

This class of estimators \(\mathcal{E}_{est}=\{E_{6j},\,E_{7j},..,\,E_{14j}\}\) have the potential to, on an event by event basis, reconstruct a fraction of \(E_{dead}\); which is crucial since \(E_{dead}\) has large fluctuations. However, one must be aware that \(\mathcal{E}_{est}\) is dependent on the jet energy. It is clearly visible from an energy scan of the estimator weights \(w_{i}\) after calibration (see Figure 3). The energy dependence of the weights is logarithmic as expected from the fact that \(e/\pi\) has a logarithmic energy dependence as well as the shower longitudinal size [3]. The validation and selection of the most efficient estimators were based on scatter plots that showed the correlation between the estimated energy loss and the true energy lost in the \(m_{dead}\) GEANT volumes (see Figure 4).

Figure 3: Weight energy dependence for the estimators \(E_{ij},\,|\eta|=0.3\) and \(cone=0.7\). The small energy dependence for \(w(HAD_{B})\) is mainly due to an accidental \(e/\pi\) compensation by punch through leakage at high energy.

## 5 Input data, event topology and selection

For the event topology \(\mathcal{T}\), keeping in mind the spirit of maximum simplicity, the simulated event starts by generating back-to-back light quark anti-quark pairs using the generator PYTHIA 5.7[4] with fixed energy at different fixed \(\eta\) positions but continuous in \(\phi\). After fragmentation the particles are tracked through the ATLAS detector with GEANT, digitized and reconstructed with the ATRECON package [5].

The quark energies [6] studied are 20, 50, 200 and 1000 GeV: 50 and 200 GeV are generated at \(\eta=\{0.3,0.6,0.9,1.1,1.3,1.5,1.7\}\); while 20 GeV and 1000 GeV are generated at \(\eta=\{0.3,0.9,1.3\}\) only. All jets reconstructed at particle level with more than 70% of the original parton energy and reconstructed in the calorimeter within 0.15 of the nominal

Figure 4: Correlation between the estimator and energy lost in the \(m_{dead}\) GEANT volumes. All plots except the upper right are based on \(\pi^{+}\) simulations since only detailed \(m_{dead}\) volume information were available for \(\pi\) particles. The upper right plot shows energy in the endcap cryostat for 200 GeV jets at \(|\eta|=1.3\). The error bars give the RMS of the distribution.

\(\eta\), are kept for further analysis. This selection is done to decouple the effect of the tails of the fragmentation and study the intrinsic resolution of the calorimeter.

In the case of a proton-proton-interaction, final state particles and beam remnants will be boosted in the forward direction so it is favorable to use boost invariant parameters like \(\phi\), \(\eta\) and \(E_{T}\) in the data analysis. However, non compensating calorimeters are sensitive to the total energy \(E\) deposited, therefore it is also useful to work with this quantity while studying calorimeter behavior.

Muons are minimum ionizing particles and usually carry energy beyond the hadronic calorimeters. Inclusion of this energy would require combined measurements with the muon chambers. However, less than 1% of the energy is carried by muons in the case of light quark jets. Hence any influence of the muons is simply ignored.

## 6 Jet definition

### Jet algorithm

Jets are not clearly defined objects like elementary particles, but rather follow from definition. The definition is not unique, and the choice depend on algorithm performance for different observables and on implementations.

The most commonly used definition in hadron colliders up till now has been based on the cone algorithm [7]. The other main approach is based on clustering algorithms [8], e.g. the \(K_{T}\) algorithm [9]-[10]. From a theoretical point of view the standard cone is not favored due to the obvious lack of intrinsic infrared and collinear safety1 which makes it difficult to compare higher order observable effects with theory. Due to this non uniqueness of the jet definition, the study of jet algorithms is an active field of research in phenomenology.

Footnote 1: This drawback can be remedied by a simple modification to the iterative version of the cone algorithm[11].

In this study a fixed cone algorithm of either size \(R\)=0.4 or \(R\)=0.7 has been used, where \(R^{2}=(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}\). No treatment of jet overlap is applied. The algorithm is taken from the JetFinder Library [12] in ATRECON. Two thresholds define the jet in the cone algorithm: the initial jetseed \(E_{T}\) threshold \(S_{(GeV)}\) and the minimum jet \(E_{T}\) threshold \(T_{(GeV)}\). The reconstruction is done with the calorimeter calibrated at the EM scale. In addition, resolution effects, noise and pile-up, energy loss in dead material affect the visible energy (see Figure 5 and 6). Due to the event selection of the calibration sample the \(S_{(GeV)}\) and \(T_{(GeV)}\) are not critical as long as the efficiency is not severely affected, see table 1. The baseline definition is \(S_{1.5}\) and \(T_{7}\) for 20 GeV jets at \(|\eta|=0.3\) with no pile-up, and \(S_{2.5}\) when pile-up is enabled (see the noise chapter for more details). For non pile-up 20 GeV jets (note that the jet energy is in \(E\) not \(E_{T}\)) at large \(|\eta|\), \(S_{0.8}\) and \(T_{3}\) was used to avoid a biased selection of more energetic and hence \(EM\) rich jets which have a better resolution than the rest of the jet sample. \(S_{(GeV)}\) for pile-up is kept constant due to the uniform pile-up level across \(\eta\).

### Separation of detector response and out of cone physics

To have a chance to understand the role of the detector, the detector specific effects must be disentangled from the out of cone physics. The way it is done here is the following: the true energy \(E_{true}\) is defined as the sum of those fragmented particles from the generator that, after bending in the magnetic field, pass within cells that belong to the reconstructed jet cone. That is, \(E_{true}\) is assumed to be the unknown energy that is to be measured and should not be confused with the original hard scatter tree level quark or gluon energy.

This enables us to concentrate on the detector performance for reconstructing jets by looking at the deviations between the reconstructed jet response and \(E_{true}\). The reasons for deviation are many: energy lost in dead material, non compensation due to difference in electromagnetic and hadronic response \(h/e\neq 1\), energy leaking out of the cone due to showers, longitudinal leakage at high energies, etc (see Figure 7). When those effects are under control, one can start to turn on the noise from the electronics, pile-up at high luminosity \(\mathcal{L}\). Also any cell or tower cut thresholds \(E_{trash}\) play an important role.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l l l} \hline Simu. level. & \(S_{0.5}\) & \(S_{1.0}\) & \(S_{1.5}\) & \(S_{2.0}\) & \(S_{2.5}\) & \(S_{3.0}\) \\ \hline Generator(\(T_{3}\)) & 2.6 & 2.6 & 2.6 & 2.4 & 2.3 & 2.1 \\ Generator(\(T_{7}\)) & 1.9 & 1.9 & 1.9 & 1.9 & 1.9 & 1.9 \\ Calorimeter(\(T_{3}\)) & 2.3(93) & 2.2(94) & 2.0(96) & 1.7(98) & 1.4(98) & 1.0(98) \\ Calorimeter(\(T_{7}\)) & 1.7(98) & 1.7(98) & 1.6(98) & 1.5(99) & 1.3(99) & 1.0(99) \\ Calo.+noise(\(T_{7}\)) & 1.6(97) & 1.6(97) & 1.6(97) & 1.5(98) & 1.2(98) & 1.0(99) \\ Calo.+pile.(\(T_{7}\)) & 15.2(8) & 14.3(9) & 9.5(13) & 5.5(22) & 3.4(30) & 2.3(37) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: \(EM\) scale 20 GeV dijet multiplicity (purity in %) for \(R\)=0.4 and \(|\eta|=0.3\) as a function of the jet seed \(S_{(GeV)}\). The purity is defined here as the number of calo. jets within \(R\)=0.2 of a generator level jet divided by the number of calo. jets. Generator level means fragmented particles without the detector.

Figure 5: \(EM\) scale \(E_{T}\) distributions for 20 GeV jets, \(R\)=0.4 at \(|\eta|=0.3\). Solid plots show generator\(E_{T}\) and dashed plots show calorimeter \(E_{T}\). The EM scale response of the calorimeter is of course lower then at generator level, see figure 7. For the left plot no noise is added (\(S_{1.5}\)), and for the right plot electronic noise and pile-up are added (\(S_{2.5}\)). All plots are \(T_{3}\) instead of \(T_{7}\) in order to show more of the distributions. One jet is randomly selected from each event.

### Jet energy reference reliability

As mentioned in the previous section, there is no clear definition of the true energy 2. The cell approximation, fluctuations at the boundary of the cells or the theoretical jet cone

Figure 6: \(EM\) scale \(E_{T}\) distributions for 20 GeV jets after selection for the calibration sample, \(R\)=0.4 at \(|\eta|=0.3\). Solid plots show generator \(E_{T}\) and dashed plots show calorimeter \(E_{T}\). For the left plot no noise is applied (\(S_{1.5}\)), and for the right plot electronic noise and pile-up are applied (\(S_{2.5}\)). All plots are \(T_{3}\). The reconstruction efficiency of the pile-up jet sample in the calorimeter is 75% in this particular case.

introduces uncertainties. By comparing the difference between the theoretical cone and the cell approximation it is possible to estimate the order of magnitude of this effect. The difference was found to be 3% or less. This is a rather large effect and sets a bound on how well the fluctuations in e.g. dead material can be compensated, regardless of the properties of the estimator.

Footnote 4: The effect of the \(EM\) scale is not negligible, but the effect of the \(EM\) scale is not negligible.

Another source of uncertainty is low momentum particles. Charged particles are cut off by the bending magnet and curl within the magnetic field at \(P_{t}<0.5\) GeV. However, for these light quark jets the multiplicities of charged low \(p_{T}\) particles are very low and the impact on the jet energy was measured to be completely negligible, at least with no minimum bias background present. The total amount of low momentum photons was 3% or less within the jet.

## 7 Calibration

The reference given by \(E_{true}\) allows to disentangle the calibration of the detector from the problem of the definition of the jets, although in real life we will have to face both problems at the same time. Even with this simplification, the calibration \(C\) has still a complicated parameter dependence:

\[C=C\left(\mathcal{T},\mathcal{L},R,E,\eta,E_{thres}\right)\]

That is, it is hard to provide a generic calibration for all situations without relying on compromises and parameterizations.

The first step in a Benchmark calibration is to equalize all subdetectors elements to the electromagnetic scale by for example using a known electron beam. However, a jet is composed of a mixture of electromagnetic \(EM\) and hadronic \(HAD\) interacting particles so the electromagnetic scale will on average not be correct. An effective way to compensate for this would be to study the energy dependence of every cell in every subdetector; then by looking at the energy deposited in each cell on an event to event basis correct to a common scale before adding up the total jet energy. This is what is done in e.g. the H1 method [13]. Just considering ATLAS 214000 \(EM\) cells and 20000 \(HAD\) cells gives you a flavor of that this is not a trivial task. But it can be done, just as in the H1 experiment, and as in smaller test beam analysis [14]. The reason why the problem becomes possible to handle in the end of the analysis is that the number of parameters can be vastly reduced by parameterizations.

What we do here is very simple. The detector compartments which behave in a similar way are clustered together at the \(EM\) scale and then the weighted sum of these compartments are optimized:

\[\min_{w_{i}}\sum_{j}^{Events~{}Compart.} \tag{1}\]

This will not correct for event to event fluctuations due to \(h/e\neq 1\), but rather minimize the error on average for a given set of events, at least now the average is at the correct energy scale. The procedure is far from optimal; but if it is done with the \(C\) parameters fixed, the approximation for that configuration is good enough so that one can start to talk about combined calorimetry and study effects like energy lost in dead material.

A subtlety which is worth mentioning is that this optimization has a small hidden linearity bias. The effect is so small that it does not really matter in this study3, however it is instructive to see how this bias comes about. Let the model output energy be \(E^{*}+n\), where \(n\) is a normal process \(N(0,\sigma)\) and E the nominal energy. Then:

Footnote 3: By adding a linearity constraint is has been shown [14] that this side effect can easily be removed.

\[\min_{E^{*}}<(E^{*}+n-E)^{2}>=\min_{E^{*}}\{E^{*^{2}}+<n^{2}>+E^{2}-2EE^{*}\}\]

Since for a sampling calorimeter

\[\frac{\sigma^{2}}{E^{*^{2}}}\simeq\frac{a^{2}}{E}\]

\[<n^{2}>=\sigma^{2}=\frac{a^{2}E^{*^{2}}}{E}\]

one arrives at the somewhat surprising result:

\[E^{*}=E-a^{2}\]

For a 50 GeV jet this gives (see also fig. 8):

\[\frac{E^{*}}{E}=1-\frac{a^{2}}{E}=\{a\simeq 50\%\}=0.995\]

Figure 8: Linearity for 50 GeV and 200 GeV jets. Deviation from linearity is an artifact of the optimization procedure [15] and can be remedied by Lagrangian multipliers [14].

Electronic noise and pile-up

To understand the performance of the detector, one inevitably has to consider the effect of noise. At low \(\mathcal{L}\) the dominant noise source is the electronics. The electronic noise is simulated in the digitization by adding gaussian noise according to the specifications for each calorimeter cell. At high \(\mathcal{L}\), multiple minimum bias interactions per bunch crossing and the fact that the detectors are sensitive during more than one bunch have the effect of what can be regarded as an additional type of noise, the pile-up noise.

The reader should be aware that there are noise effects that are not included in the simulation. However the design goal is to reach a level were these effects are negligible compared to the intrinsic contributions. Example of such effects are quantization errors in the digitization and photo-electron statistics.

### Electronic noise

The tower electronic noise is approximately 200 MeV (Figure 9 and 10) at the \(EM\) scale for \(|\eta|<1.7\) with digital filtering enabled [16]. This increases by \(10\%-20\%\) after weighting. Depending on the energy and the cone size the expected electronic noise level within the cone is \((C_{noise-type}^{cone}\simeq 1.2\) is a scaling constant due to the weighting):

\[E_{n\,\alpha\,ise}^{0.7}=C_{\,\epsilon\epsilon\epsilon\epsilon}^{0.7}0.2\sqrt {7\,^{2}\pi}\simeq 2.9\ \mathrm{GeV}\]

\[E_{n\,\alpha\,ise}^{0.4}=C_{\,\epsilon\epsilon\epsilon\epsilon}^{0.4}0.2\sqrt {4\,^{2}\pi}\simeq 1.7\ \mathrm{GeV}\]

The standard method to improve the signal to noise ratio \(SNR\) is to introduce an optimal cell cut \(E_{l\,break\,thresh}\). However, one must be very careful to avoid any energy bias. For the electronic noise a symmetric cell cut suffices to keep the result unbiased. To get a feeling

Figure 9: \(EM\) scale \(E_{T}\) tower noise distribution at \(|\eta|<0.3\). Left plots shows electronic noise, right plot shows electronic and pile-up noise. The non zero average of the right plot is due to the fact that no pedestal correction is applied in the simulation of the unipolar channels in Tile.

how a cell cut works it is instructive to make a little toy example. In Figure 11 a uniformly distributed signal between 1 a.u. and 3 a.u. with and without additional Gaussian noise is symmetrically thresholded at 1.5 a.u. For a given noise with standard deviation \(\sigma\) there will be an optimal threshold which depends on the signal level and distribution. An example with the effects of different cell thresholds for 50 GeV jets is given in Table 2. From the table it is clear that the effect of signal loss when the threshold is large is less dramatic after adding noise, simply because smearing reduces the impact of the threshold. The optimal cell cut for electronic noise was found to be \(1.5\sigma-2.0\sigma\) for 50 GeV. For 20 GeV the minimum is very shallow. The overall improvement using thresholds seems not to be very significant, but thresholds are probably needed anyway for practical reasons to reduce the amount of information.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline  & 0.0\(\sigma\) & 1.0\(\sigma\) & 1.5\(\sigma\) & 2.0\(\sigma\) & 2.5\(\sigma\) \\ \hline no noise & 7.8\% & 9.5\% & 11.4\% & 12.2\% & 14.0\% \\ noise & 11.2\% & 11.1\% & 10.8\% & 10.8\% & 11.2\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 10: \(EM\) scale tower RMS noise as a function of \(\eta\). The forward region is not included in the noise simulation. When plotting \(E_{T}\) rather then \(E\) the pile-up noise stays at 0.5 GeV for higher \(\eta\).

### Pile-up

The simulation of pile-up is done separately and later added in the reconstruction phase [16]. Fully simulated minimum bias events are drawn with Poisson statistics (on average 23 events) and added to each cell during the reconstruction using the correct shaping function for each readout channel. Thus correlations in both space and time are considered. With the results from Figure 9 the expected pile-up noise level within the cone in the central barrel region is:

\[E_{pi\,le\_up}^{0.4}=C_{p}^{0.4}0.5\sqrt{4^{2}\pi}\simeq 4.3\ \mathrm{GeV}\]

Figure 11: The effect of applying a threshold. It could e.g. be a cell in the calorimeter. The first plot shows a signal with a flat distribution between 1 a.u. and 3 a.u., the probability for a signal different from zero in the event is 50%, i.e. the mean is 1 a.u. In the second plot a threshold at 1.5 a.u. is applied (e.g. a cell cut). The effect of adding \(N(0,\sigma)\) noise is shown in the last two plots. Notice how the expected mean of the signal is recovered by adding noise, and how the spread can be diminished by the threshold. The bottom line of this example is to enlighten the reader of the fundamental difference between thresholding a clean signal and thresholding in the presence of noise.

assuming non coherent towers, which is not exactly true for pile-up.

To improve the \(SNR\) for the pile-up noise the most obvious technique is to apply a tower cut. Unfortunately the signal is not unbiased for pile-up. To study this effect a separate analysis was launched. The \(E_{T}\) tower map was stored separately, both generator level and \(EM\) calibrated calorimeter level energies. First the JetFinder cone algorithm was run on the generator level to find the proper jet direction, then a cone was applied on the calorimeter level using the proper jet direction. The result is summarized in Table 3. It is important to note that given the direction, no cut whatsoever is applied in the cone summation in order to maintain an unbiased estimator. The bias for pile-up with proper jet direction is expected since no baseline correction is implemented in the simulation for the unipolar Tile channels. The pile-up noise is positive and hence introduces a positive baseline shift. 4 This bias must be corrected before the jet calibration. If this was the only bias source it would now be possible to search for an optimal tower cut since we have full control of the unbiased signal loss once we start to cut. To make this clear, applying any cuts on a biased signal renders the signal useless unless you have complete control of the noise convoluted signal loss. However, there is also another bias, not in the cell energy but in the jet energy estimator which has to do with the intrinsic thresholds in the definition of the jet. The large pile-up bias with jet directions from the calorimeter level cone algorithm hints at the fact that the jet direction is not stable for 20 GeV jets at high luminosity. Not enough data was available to fully understand the energy dependence at low energy. Since robust jet estimator bias corrections were not possible, results with optimal tower cuts are not presented.

Footnote 4: The bipolar shaping in LAr automatically averages any trigger independent signal (e.g. minimum bias events) to zero.

### Reconstruction of the jet direction

Throughout this analysis the jet direction is calculated at the \(EM\) scale. It should be noted that the resolution is expected to be improved after proper energy calibration. This option is not further pursued.

Using the particle level jet direction as a reference it is interesting to verify the jet angular resolution, both in \(\eta\) and in \(\phi\). The angular resolution for 20 GeV jets at \(|\eta|=0.3\) is shown in Table 4.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline  & Part. & direc. & Calo. \\  & \(E_{T}\) (GeV) & \(E_{T}\) (GeV) \\ \hline no noise & 11.2 & 11.7 \\ electronic noise & 11.2 & 11.8 \\ pile-up noise & 13.3 & 15.6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 9 Main simulation results

The main simulation results concern the resolution of reconstructed jets. The response should be as uniform as possible in \(\eta\), and conform to the design goal:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{50\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3\%\]

### Uniformity in \(\eta\)

By performing the minimization defined in (1), at each \(\eta\) point for fixed energies, \(\eta\) uniformity scans were produced (see Figure 12). To find the best set of estimators in the calibration (1), the optimization was performed in several steps. Since many of the estimators are correlated, it was not obvious which one to prefer. By first including all of the estimators the optimizer hints at the best estimators since they have a smaller relative error. As is usually the case for multi parameter fits it is beneficial to reduce the number of free parameters as much as possible. This was done by pruning the estimators with very large errors. This was found to be an effective and robust approach. For an example see table 5.

In Figure 12 one can see that for 50 GeV and \(R=0.4\) the dominant effect at high \(|\eta|\) is the fluctuation of energy outside of the cone. The effect can easily be understood geometrically by looking at the relationship:

\[\eta=-\frac{1}{2}|\texttt{intan}\,\theta/2\]

differentiation leads to,

\[\delta\eta=\frac{1}{2|\texttt{sin}\,\theta|}\delta\theta\]

consequently an initial spread in \(\theta\) translates into an increasing spread in \(\eta\) at large \(|\eta|\). The effect is less pronounced at higher energies since the boost makes the jet narrower.

As can be expected, there is still an influence of the dead material. However, there is significant improvement compared to the performance without some of the \(E_{dead}\) estimators. Especially the scintillators turns out to be effective for compensating \(E_{dead}\), see Figure 13.

### Energy dependence

The jet reconstruction performance of the calorimeter can also be explored with only the energy as a free parameter. In Figure 14 energy scans are shown for \(\eta=0.3\) and \(\eta=1.3\). The large effect of the cone size and noise for lower energies is clear. One might ask why

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline \hline  & \(\delta\eta\) (mrad) & \(\delta\phi\) (mrad) \\ \hline no noise & 43\(\pm\)3 & 43\(\pm\)4 \\ electronic noise & 49\(\pm\)4 & 49\(\pm\)3 \\ pile-up noise & 59\(\pm\)4 & 59\(\pm\)4 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\(R=0.7\) is included since the resolution is better with \(R=0.4\) when noise is added. However, thresholding the cell energies changes the situation and \(R=0.7\) can become competitive. As we have seen in the section describing the noise the improvement with thresholds is not that dramatic; but, in reality thresholds play an important role to reduce the vast amount of information and may be unavoidable.

### Parameterization of the jet resolution

The parameterization of the jet resolution as a function of energy for different configurations is shown in Figure 14 and Table 6. The resolution can be split into three main contributions with different energy dependence: statistical fluctuations that scale as \(\sqrt{E}\) (e.g. the sampling in the calorimeter), linear terms due to e.g. miscalibrations or noncompensation, and a constant term due to noise. In the parameterization the terms are assumed to be uncorrelated thus

\[\sigma^{2}=\left(a\sqrt{E}\right)^{2}+\left(bE\right)^{2}+c^{2}\]

or in a more common notation

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus b\oplus\frac{c}{E}\]

These parameterizations can be compared to those made in fast simulations such as ATLFAST [18].

When the noise is compared with and without cell cuts, the sampling and the linear term is held constant in order to understand the noise contribution. The reason for fixing the parameters is that they are correlated. It is probably true that the sampling term is affected by the cell cuts but the effect is assumed to be small.

Figure 16: Reconstruction of the invariant mass from the decay \(W\to jj\). The top plot shows the mass reconstructed with ATLFAST [18]. The mass shift is due the the final state radiation and fragmentation loss which leaks out of the cone. The middle plot shows the result using full simulation but with only \(EM\) calibration. The bottom plot shows full simulation with the complete detector calibration explained in this note. All examples uses \(R=\)0.4.

## 11 Conclusions

Light dijet events up \(|\eta|<1.7\) have been analyzed with the updated new geometry. Compared to previous analyses made for the ATLAS Calorimeter Performance Technical Design Report, no major degradation of the resolution have been detected. The effects of electronic and pile-up noise have also been studied. However, the pile-up noise is not unbiased and a more detailed analysis is necessary to state qualitative numbers of the performance with applied cuts.
