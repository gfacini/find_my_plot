2. Low frequency vibrations.

The electrostatic deflection beyond the gravitational sag was measured and found to be 23\(\mu\)m \(\pm\)3\(\mu\)m at the operating voltage of 3100 V, which is small compared to the gravitational sag of 412 micron. This 6% electrostatic effect is consistent with the theoretical prediction of Osborne, Pless, and Taylor [3], and is well within the operational stability range of long tubes. Our measurement indicates that the long ATLAS muon tubes do not require central wire supports for electrostatic stability.

Study of the vibration effects was done by mounting a motor with eccentric disk on the tube mounting structure. The motor has a tunable motion frequency. The structure motion monitoring were performed using two precision mechanical indicators, one measured horizontal vibration amplitude, and the other, vertical vibration amplitude. The set up is shown in Fig. 2. Wire motion, again, was

observed through the middle tube holes using a precision ruler. We operated the motor with the vibration frequencies from 10 Hz to 58 Hz, the observations are the following:

1. Oscillations at the wire resonant frequencies (the 1st order (27 Hz) and the 2nd order (56 Hz) eigen frequencies) stands out very clearly. The maximum observed gain in vibration amplitude is about 40, i.e. for 51 microns vibration amplitude at the end-plug, 2 mm wire amplitude vibration at the tube center was observed.
2. When off the resonant frequencies by 10% (i.e. at 24 Hz and 30 Hz) the wire displacement motion was negligible (less than 10 microns).
3. At 10 Hz frequency, we induced 500 microns vibration amplitude (peak to peak) to the tube mounting structure, we observed no vibration on wire.

Based on ATLAS muon TDR and the LEP experiments experience, the large supporting structure resonant frequencies should be less than 10 Hz. Thus we do not expect such low frequency would cause the wire vibration. At the moment, it is unknown the actual ATLAS environment. However, we believe it is much less risky and more cost-effective to control vibrations by minimizing vibration sources in the ATLAS experimental hall and using external dampers (in case it is necessary) rather than by implementing central wire locators. Such locators nearly double the complexity and cost of tube construction, reduce the chamber active area, and in any case do not eliminate possible vibration effects.

### Simulation Results and Conclusion

The claim that tubes should be bent to conform to the gravitational sag of sense wires is based on the concern that an asymmetric space-time function due to uncompensated wire sag degrades the muon momentum resolution by an unacceptable amount. We have made a detailed study [2] of the effect of such an asymmetry and find that it has essentially no impact on the momentum resolution:

1. For muon transverse momentum less than 100 GeV, the momentum degradation is completely negligible. This implies that without bending the tube there will be no effect on the Level 2 muon trigger and no effect on the detection of the low mass Higgs decay to muons.
2. For 500 GeV transverse momentum muons, the momentum resolution increases from 5.6% to 5.8% with no increase of non-Gaussian tails. This implies no effect on charge identification for detecting the high mass gauge bosons, \(Z^{\prime}\) and \(W^{\prime}\).
3. We also note that, if desired, the effects of space-time function asymmetries can be corrected during the iterative process of muon-track reconstruction.

Further studies also show that straight tube configuration has no effect on auto-calibration procedure, nor decreasing the sensitivity of monitoring the environment changing.

We therefore strongly recommend that tubes not be bent since the benefit would be small and the additional construction difficulties large. We note that, because of varying tube lengths within a chamber, bending does not completely remove asymmetries even if the wire tension is tuned to compensate for tube length. In addition, due to the staircase shape of the end-cap MDT chambers, bending tubes will result in adjacent tubes of different lengths touching each other and possibly ruining the tube alignment. Finally, bending of tubes will mean additional alignment work adjusting and measuring comb positions every time a chamber of different azimuthal orientation is constructed.
