**Abstract**

A first batch of up to 6 m long aluminium tubes with an outer diameter of 30 mm and 250 \(\mu\)m walls produced by industry has been measured. Results on the inner and outer tube diameters and the wall thickness are reported.

Aluminium tubes with an outer diameter of 30 mm and 250 \(\mu\)m wall thickness are foreseen to be the basic driftcells in the ATLAS precision muon chambers [1]. A first batch of such tubes has been produced by industry [2] and was measured in the CERN metrology service for wall thickness and inner and outer tube diameter. The specifications for the tubes were: engineering tolerances of 15 \(\mu\)m on the wall thickness and 20 \(\mu\)m on the tube diameter.

The measurements reported here were performed on 12 tube pieces of \(\sim\) 1 m length. These tube sections were rejects, cut out of the production because of physical damage (dents, large scratches, etc...) somewhere along the tubes. For the measurement only tubes with both ends undamaged (by eye inspection) were used.

The measurements were performed using an electronically controlled probe touching the tube surface. Each of the 12 tubes was measured at four positions, 50 and 100 mm from either tube end. The tube-wall coordinates were taken at eight points around the tube, both on the inside and outside surface, resulting in a measurement of the wall thickness at these points. An inner and outer circle was fitted to the measured coordinates and the deviations of the measurements with respect to the fitted circles was determined.

The individual measurement values are given in the EXCEL sheets appended. Figures 1-4 show the results in form of distributions. No single measurement has been discarded and no attempt was made to identify obvious bad measurements. Figure 1 shows the thickness of the tube walls for the 48 \(\times\) 8 measurements taken on the 1 m tubes pieces. The average wall thickness is 244 \(\mu\)m and the r.m.s. of the distribution is 6 \(\mu\)m. From the individual eight measurements per position (see EXCEL sheet below) it can be seen that there is no systematic variation in the wall thickness around the circumference of the tubes.

The results on the tube diameters are given in Figs. 2 and 3. They show the fitted inner and outer diameters of the 48 measured points. The average inner diameter is \(D_{i}\) = 29.519 mm and the r.m.s. of the distribution is 0.014 mm. The corresponding values for the outer diameter are \(D_{o}\) = 30.004 mm and r.m.s.=0.013 mm. In addition to the fitted diameters, the deviation of the measured coordinates from the fitted circle is of interest. Figure 4 shows the maximum deviation in each of the 96 (inner and outer) tube diameters from the fitted circumference. Note, that the observed deviations are typically less than 5 \(\mu\)m.

**Conclusions:**

The tubes are good. Taking into account a factor of 2 between r.m.s. values and engineering tolerances (r.m.s.=engineering tolerance/2), the measured quantities almost fulfil the requirements: the wall thickness variation is smaller than the 15 \(\mu\)m (engineering) tolerance asked for; the inner and outer diameter (engineering) tolerance of 20 \(\mu\)m has not quite been achieved. However, the results of 13 and 14 \(\mu\)m (r.m.s.) are very closed to what is required. Keeping in mind that the measurements were performed on non-pressurized tubes, we conclude that the quality of the tubes of the first production is adequate for the construction of MDTs for the ATLAS muon spectrometer.

We are greatful to the CERN metrology service for their efficient and precise work. Special thanks go to S. L'Huillier for her patient and quick help with introducing the data into EXCEL sheets and the preparation of the data so they could be easily histogrammed.
