This note presents updated figures that summarise top cross-section results from the ATLAS top working group and the LHCtopWG.

## Changes with respect to previous summary plots

The plots in this note supersede their equivalents in Ref. [1]. The changes are as follows:

**Table 1**

* The references of the \(t\bar{t}\), \(tZj\) and \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross-section measurements at \(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV have been updated from CONF notes to the papers published in the journals or on arxiv.

**Figure 2 & Table 3**

* The reference of the ATLAS \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section measurement in the lepton+jets channel at \(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV has been updated from CONF note to the paper in arxiv. Changes in the least significant digit for the central value and systematic uncertainties are noted.

**Figures 3 and 4**

* The references of the \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section measurement in the lepton+jets channel and \(e\mu\) channel (ATLAS) and \(\tau+e/\mu\) (CMS) at \(\sqrt{s}=13\)TeV have been updated.

**Figures 6, 10, 17, 18 and 19**

* The reference of the CMS \(t\)-channel cross-section, \(R_{t}\) and \(V_{tb}\) measurements has been updated. Changes in the central values and systematic uncertainties are noted.

**Figure 13**

* Added the ATLAS \(tW\) cross-section measurement at \(\sqrt{s}=8\)TeV in the lepton+jets channel.

### All channels - ATLAS + CMS

Figure 2: Summary of ATLAS measurements of the top-pair production cross-section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy compared to the NNLO QCD calculation complemented with NNLL resummation (top++2.0). The theory band represents uncertainties due to renormalisation and factorisation scales, parton density functions and the strong coupling. The measurements and the theory calculation are quoted at \(m_{t}=172.5\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\). Measurements made at the same centre-of-mass energy are slightly offset for clarity.

Figure 3: Summary of LHC and Tevatron measurements of the top-pair production cross-section as a function of the centre-of-mass energy compared to the NNLO QCD calculation complemented with NNLL resummation (top++2.0). The theory band represents uncertainties due to renormalisation and factorisation scales, parton density functions and the strong coupling. The measurements and the theory calculation are quoted at \(m_{t}=172.5\GeV\). Measurements made at the same centre-of-mass energy are slightly offset for clarity.

For each result, the contribution to the total uncertainty originating from the uncertainty on the theoretical prediction for the single top production cross-section is shown along with the uncertainty originating from the experimental measurement of the cross-section.
