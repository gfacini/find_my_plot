###### Abstract

A method for a Level 2 trigger for the ATLAS muon system in the region \(0\leq|\eta|\leq 2\) is described. The method is based on pattern recognition in both the trigger and monitored drift tube chambers and a reconstruction algorithm for the monitored drift tube system. The MDT pattern recognition algorithm uses a type of Hough transform to measure the adjacency of candidate tracks and a \(\chi^{2}\) test to select and refine MDT candidate tracks [Ref.1]. The trigger momentum is estimated by comparing the radius of curvature for the reconstructed MDT track within a trigger road with a linear interpolation of nearly matching tracks read from a fast lookup table. The performance of the algorithm under a random noise background is simulated. Resolutions of order 5% and 10% by gaussian fits are achieved for 20 GeV and 6 GeV P\({}_{\rm t}\) muon tracks, respectively, with an overall reconstruction efficiency of \(\geq\) 97%.

## 1 Introduction

A muon trigger scheme must have both speed and simplicity, while having sufficient resolution in order to discriminate against low momentum tracks. The ATLAS muon system has enough bending power to produce asgittae of order several centimeters for P\({}_{\rm t}\)\(\sim\) 20 GeV, which can be crudely resolved by the MDT hit pattern without drift information. However, in a high background environment the hit tube pattern is likely to have large accidental rates and pattern recognition at the drift level with resolutions of order 100 \(\upmu\)m RMS will be necessary to reject spurious hits. Further, there is a high premium for goodmomentum resolution allowing the trigger threshold to be set higher while maintaining good efficiency for the 'interesting' tracks. Thus our algorithm is based on pattern recognition and reconstruction of the _MDT drift information_ selected by the road defined by the Level 1 trigger. The simulation code is written with several control parameters which can be changed in order to study the compromise of resolution versus trigger formation speed and to measure the performance against various experimental effects.

We use a hierarchical scheme in our pattern recognition. First we execute code to determine the trigger road in the MDT chambers from the information supplied by the trigger Level 1 hits. Within the trigger road so defined a local track reconstruction to determine a'superhit' in a given MDT multilayer is performed. The superhits of the track are assembled to determine the radius of curvature of the candidate track. The trigger momentum is found by matching the reconstructed track with patterns of tracks stored in a fine-grained lookup table by scaling the measured track radius with the set of four closest calibration tracks radii. By scaling the track radius, rather than using the asgittae or point-line measure, we have a momentum measurable which is more independent of the particular hit pattern of the track. Thus we achieve a considerable simplification since many tracks, especially in the barrel-endcap transition region, are quite complicated and the chamber hit pattern can change quite rapidly as a function of momentum, \(\eta\) or \(\phi\). The radius method is a means to use all hit chamber information in a manner roughly independent of where the super points are actually located.

Similar ideas have been employed with success in a Level 2 trigger scheme in the barrel region [Ref.2] and have been used in a stand-alone Monte Carlo study of the performance of the ATLAS muon system [Ref.1]. An adaptation of our MDT pattern recognition algorithm has been used to analyze test beam data [Ref.3].

## 2 Monte Carlo Data

Data were generated for this study by ATLASIM [Ref.4] using geometry version M1.6 with super hits reconstructed for comparison by MUONBOX 50011 [Ref.5] when required. The results of MUONBOX served as a useful comparison for BMC code validation but were not directly used in the BMC algorithm. We have also generated events directly using DICE which are analyzed independently of MUONBOX. Random noise, controlled by the mean Poissonian probability of hitting a tube within an adjustable trigger road, can be introduced in order to study operation of the algorithm. Figure 1 shows an exaggerated noisy condition in the first super layer. All the wire positions, as well as the results of the MUONBOX reconstruction, were written to an ASCII file which was read by the BMC trigger simulation code.

## 3 The Algorithm

### Pattern Recognition in the Trigger Chambers

The first stage of the trigger momentum reconstruction is the determination of the regions of interest (RoI) defined by the trigger chambers. The RPC hits are used in the barrel which are located around the middle and behind (in front of) the outer MDT superlayer for the large (small) chamber \(\phi\)-tower. The TGC hits are used in the endcap region with one station in front of the middle superlayer and two stations behind middle superlayer. An additional TGC is located in the first SL which is not used in the Level 1 trigger formation but is employed to improve the Level 2 RoI in that region.

For the barrel we take the RPC hits bracketing the middle superlayer and the RPC hits in the outer superlayer, if they exits, to reconstruct a circle trajectory of the track within the barrel toroid. This circle is used to determine the RoI in the first superlayer and to refine the RoI in the middle and outer SLs. For events which have no outer SL hits, as is sometimes the case for low trigger threshold operation, we perform a rough circle fit to the line constructed by the RPC hits in the middle SL and the IP under the assumption that the muon trajectory in the r-z plane (toroid bend plane) is a straight line up to the first SL then becomes a circle in the barrel toroidal system.

For the endcap system the RoIs are determined by a circle fit of the muon trajectory through the endcap toroid using TGC hits to fix the tangent line following the trajectory and the IP to determine the rough position of the trajectory in the first SL. This position is refined by the actual TGC hit (not a participant in the Level 1 trigger). The RoI of the outer SL is determined by the extrapolation of the tangent line fixed by the trigger chambers.

Tracks in the nonbend plane of both the barrel and endcaps are fit to straight lines using the RPC or TGC hit information. In order to define the RoI the space point of the track determined from the trigger chamber information is rotated to the same \(\phi_{0}\) as the MDT chambers of the event. Typically the trigger roads (95 % CL gaussian shape) in the barrel are 3 MDT tubes wide (9 cm) in the first SL and 2 (6 cm) in the middle and outer one for a very good track (quality factor, q=0) at 20 GeV. For a poor track, as determine by the quality factor of the trigger chamber fits, the RoI is widened by the multiplicative factor (1+2\(\sqrt[]{\rm{q}}\)). In the endcap at 20 GeV the trigger roads are 2 tubes wide in the first and second SL and 4 tubes wide in the outer SL. The road is widened for operation at lower trigger thresholds by the factor 20/P\({}_{\rm t}\). Obviously, there is a premium for making the RoI as narrow as possible while still including the real hit tubes of the MDT system.

### Pattern Recognition in the MDT Chambers

The second stage of the trigger formation involves the recognition of tracks in a given MDT multilayer within the trigger road defined by the trigger chamber processor described above. This is accomplished by means of an ad hoc quality factor developed from an adjacency test (a type of Hough transform) and a \(\chi^{2}\) consistency test on all tangent lines of all pairs of hit tubes consistent with broad limits of extrapolation back to the IP. The quality factor is given by:

\[{\rm Q}\,=\,\frac{{\rm n_{a}\,n_{\chi}^{2}}}{\chi^{2}}, \tag{1}\]

where n\({}_{\rm a}\) is the number of tangent lines which are close to a chosen tangent line, n\({}_{\rm c}\)\({}^{2}\) is the number of hit tubes within cuts along a given tangent line having a corresponding \(\chi^{2}\). Pairs of hit tubes were drawn from the collection of hit tubes in a given superlayer, one from each multilayer, with a minimum hit pattern of 1-2 or 2-1. If only one multilayer of a superlayer was present then the pair search was conducted within the multilayer. A flag is set to indicate how a superhit was obtained. There are no cuts on GEANT generated hits - such as cuts set to eliminate MDT hits from wide angle Bremsstrahlung or radiative pairs.

Figure 2 shows the quality factors of the ensemble of proto-tracks for a typical track embedded in 30% Poissonian random noise. The track of highest quality is chosen with weighted preference to the track with the highest number of hit tubes. The slope and intercept of this best track are refined by a least squares fit through the hit tubes to compute the corresponding multilayer superhit position. See [Ref.1] for details.

The non-drift coordinate ("s-coordinate") was determined by the trigger system. In this reconstruction, it was assumed that each trigger hit furnished a space point so that the two planar coordinates are correctly associated at the raw data level. Each space point was converted to the azimuthal angle \(\phi\), which was fit in the endcaps as a function of z (along beam), or, in the case of the barrel as a function of x (perpendicular to barrel chamber planes). Knowledge of the \(\phi\)-dependence allows the s-coordinate to be estimated by interpolating to the MDT plane. The performance of this reconstruction degrades rapidly when there are more than one hit in a given trigger chamber. By having no stereo plane in the muon system true hits can not be easily distinguished from 'ghost'  hits and the number of {x,y} combinations to consider rapidly diverges. Under this condition closely separatedcandidate hits are not easily distinguished and have to separated by swimming to the IP - a process impracticable for the Level 2 trigger.

The angle \(\phi\) should be an invariant and therefore the slope of \(\phi\) should be 0. A non-zero value indicates'solenoidal' bending in the toroids of ATLAS. Figure 3 shows the \(\phi\) slope as a function of the IP for an ensemble of \(\leavevmode\nobreak\ \leavevmode\nobreak\ \leavevmode\nobreak\ \leavevmode\nobreak\ P_{\rm t}=20\leavevmode \nobreak\ \text{GeV}\) tracks, where we note that, for at least 20 GeV transverse momentum tracks, the \(\phi\) slope is small but nonzero.

Space points are so reconstructed from the MDT and trigger planes, although only the MDT information is used for the muon trajectory determination in the bending plane. Given that the trigger planes have a rather course segmentation, only MDT hits for the same chamber central angle \(\phi_{0}\) are used in most cases. But all the MDT chamber planes are employed for tracks of less than 4 MDT planes at the same \(\phi_{0}\).

In order to follow the evolution of the chamber geometry, the pattern recognition program is given access to the wire positions at execution time. In this manner the chamber geometry can be determined as a part of the track reconstruction and avoids the tyranny of having to change all the'reconstruction' parameters every time the 'generator' geometry changes. Of course, in the final implementation of the Level 2 trigger code the chamber geometry will be 'hard wired' making this additional processing unnecessary.

Up to 20 multilayers can be reconstructed for each event so that all chamber overlaps and cases of only single multilayers are treated. All trigger planes are used in the computation of the'second' coordinate (called either "y" or "s").

The BMC reconstruction was compared with that of the MUONBOX code with generally good agreement in the drift and chamber positions with typical RMS errors of order \(\leq 30\leavevmode\nobreak\ \upmu\)m, whereas the local y-coordinate ("s-coordinate") provided by the trigger chambers had RMS errors of order 10 cm.

### Circle Fitting

The basic information needed for momentum determination is the curvature of the track and the B-field integral. Track sagitta or point-line measures are frequently used as the dispersive quantity in momentum determination. However, given the complexity of the chamber geometry of the ATLAS muon system these measures of the momentum change abruptly when, for example, a chamber boundary is crossed. On the other hand, the track radius of curvature is generally slowly varying and depends on only the momentum and field integral no matter what chamber hit pattern. Hence, we fit each track to a circle and scale the radius of curvature in order to obtain the track momentum.

The radius of curvature is calculated in 3 different ways depending on the configuration of hit chambers. The cases are:

3.3.1 All hits are within the B-field - such as tracks in the barrel or transition regions. In this case the radius of curvature is determined by a linearized least squares circle fit. All fits are performed in the 'chamber space' where the local x-coordinate (t-coordinate) is aligned with the bisector of the chamber axis and z is along the beam direction. For the endcaps 'z'  is the independent variable and for the barrel 'x' plays that role. The least squares fit is linear in the circle center coordinates {x0, z0 } and in the expression x0\({}^{2}\) + z0\({}^{2}\) - r0\({}^{2}\), where r0 is the circle radius. In the case of tracks in the overlap regions between chambers the majority \(\phi_{0}\) chambers are used if there are more than 3 superhits reconstructed - otherwise all hit chambers are used. Combining super points from different \(\phi_{0}\) regions requires the orthogonal coordinate information, which is less precise because of the finite strip widths in the trigger chambers and yields a degraded momentum resolution.

3.3.2 High n region in the endcaps with hits in superlayer forward of toroid. In this case the radius of curvature of the track is computed analytically by the slope and intercept of the trajectory following the endcap toroid and by the hit positions in the first SL.

3.3.3 High n region in the endcaps with missing front SL. This is a variant on the case described above. Here the IP is used to constrain the track and the solution of a cubic equation is employed to determine the circle. This case applies for special regions where the first SL chamber is missing, such as special regions in the endcap around the support feet of the toroid, and in the determination of the RoIs in the barrel when the last SL RPC hit is missing and in the endcap case where the tangent line in the TGC behind the toroid and the IP position is used to estimate the RoI in the first SL.

In all three cases the quality of the circle fit is estimated by an unweighted \(\chi^{2}\) measure. Figure 4 shows a 'typical' difficult track in the overlap region between 2 chamber towers at 20 GeV. In order to display the circle fit the track residuals of a straight-line fit are compared for the data and circle fit.

3.4 Track Matching with Calibration File

The momentum is determined by scaling the reconstructed track radius to the radius of the nearest 4 calibration tracks which are averaged by linear weighting of the 3D distances to the superhit'match point'. The charge of the muon is fixed by the sense of bending in the toroidal fields and is used to select the correct calibration file for the momentum reconstruction.

The average radius is then used to determine the trigger momentum by

\[P_{t}=\frac{r}{r_{c}}\,P_{c}, \tag{2}\]

where r is the reconstructed track radius of curvature, \(P_{c}\) is the calibration momentum of radius \(r_{c}\).

In order to reduce the dependence on the finite strip size of the second coordinate and attendant extrapolation errors, the'match point' is chosen to be the super point in the MDT chamber plane closest to the last trigger chamber plane. For a typical calibration file of some 8,000 points in the grid [ \(1\leq\,|\eta|\,\leq\,2,\,\,0\leq\phi\leq\pi/2\) ] the proximity of the nearest calibration point is better than 5 cm RMS in x ( "t" - drift coordinate), 25 cm in y ("s" - orthogonal coordinate) and 3 cm in z (along beam) for \(P_{t}=20\) GeV/c tracks. The charge of the muon is determined by comparison of the sign of the circle center parameters \(\{x_{0},\,z_{0}\}\) with those of the calibration file of the same charge.

The calibration files were generated using ATLASIM by averaging 10 tracks at each point with all sources of error turned off except for Bremsstrahlung using the full ATLAS detector geometry and magnetic field. A total of 8 files was created to cover both charges, endcap and barrel at 6 and 20 GeV. The average chamber super points were used as input to the same circle routines described above. The 8,000 point array of each calibration file is computed only once at initialization time and stored into memory. Figure 5 is a plot of the positive muon calibration files (barrel and endcap) at 20 GeV as a function of \(\eta\) for 3 typical \(\phi\) values in the region o to \(\pi/2\). A plot of the entire arrays would be too dense to plot.

Some further development is still needed in the determination of the calibration array. In this study it was found that small momentum-dependent adjustments of order \(\leq\) 10% are needed to adjust the ratio [r/rc] above in order to obtain the correct mean momentum. We made this small correction by using the'measured' value of r and \(\eta\) and thus was completely 'data driven'. The trigger algorithm operates at several Hz on VAX and UNIX platforms.

## 4 Momentum Resolution

Since the trigger quality is determined by the momentum resolution achieved, we first test our Level 2 trigger algorithm by studying its performance with fixed transverse momentum tracks at 20 GeV and 6 GeV for both electric charges.

In Fig. 6a we show the resolution in the endcap region \(1\leq|\eta|\leq 2\) for \(\rm P_{t}=20\) GeV positive charge with all sources of resolution smearing operative. Fig. 6b indicates the corresponding resolution for the barrel region. Figs. 6c and 6d indicate the corresponding performance under a 10% random noise burden in the MDT chambers. We note that the resolution is gaussian with a low tail which is enhanced under larger noise burdens.

Figs. 7a,b show the performance of our algorithm at \(\rm P_{t}=6\) GeV positive charge for the endcap and barrel regions, respectively, with all reconstruction errors operative except for additional random noise. As expected, the resolution performance at 6 GeV is degraded from 20 GeV by the energy loss fluctuation and multiple scattering effects. At 6 GeV the resolution is typically about 10% by gaussian measure. A subclass of events with significantly smaller resolution tails can be isolated by requiring more than 4 multilayers be hit in a given \(\phi\) chamber tower. Conversely, most of the poor resolution data correspond to tracks with only 4 or less multilayer hits reconstructed. Figs. 7c,d display the resolutions in the barrel and endcap regions, respectively, with a 10% random noise background. Again, the addition of random noise contributes to a low tail in both the 20 GeV and 6 GeV \(\rm P_{t}\) simulations. The pronounced low tail in the 6 GeV barrel 10% noise plot (Fig. 7d) is caused by high angle tracks which cross the \(\eta\)=0 region.

Figs. 8 show the performance of the algorithm for reconstructing muons of negative charge. Given that we are simulating only the first octant of the ATLAS muon system there is a slight charge asymmetry and we find that negatives have a slightly better resolution because of their longer magnetic field path length than positives.

### Summary of Resolutions

The following is a summary of the performance at \(\rm P_{t}=20\) GeV and 6 GeV positive charge. In Table 1 the efficiency is computed for any reconstruction of the trigger momentum independent of the resultant value and the RMS resolutions are computed within the limits of the plots (Figs. 6, 7). We note that random noise degrades the performance of the momentum reconstruction as evidenced by the lower reconstruction efficiency and the broader momentum resolution. By the gaussian measure of the resolution the table indicates that at 10% random noise the 6 GeV performance is degraded by a factor of 10% to 14%, whereas the 20 GeV resolution is spoiled by a factor of 1.7 to 2.

An ad hoc test was performed to determine the effect of the intrinsic drift resolution on the performance of the trigger algorithm. For this study the 20 GeV trigger was simulated in the barrel region with full GEANT errors operative, but with the radii of the MDT hits smeared by an additional \(\sigma\)=200 \(\rm\upmu m\) gaussian resolution. The result is that the gaussian resolution degrades by only a factor of 1.016 (1.6%) indicating that extreme refinements of the r-t relation are not needed at Level 2 trigger time.

## 5 Trigger Threshold and Efficiency

### Response Curves

In order to estimate the trigger threshold resolution we take a flat P\({}_{\rm t}\)  spectrum and compute the efficiency for a fixed measured P\({}_{\rm t}\) value. The P\({}_{\rm t}\) threshold is defined to be the value for which the trigger efficiency becomes 90% and is therefore dependent on the momentum resolution, trigger region and noise condition. (A more straightforward definition would be to simply fix the value of P\({}_{\rm t}\) which would be the 50% efficiency point.) The results are shown in Figs 9a,b for 20 GeV threshold in the endcap and barrel, respectively and in Figs. 9c,d for the 6 GeV operation under the condition of no addition random noise. For this simulation we have not yet included the Level 1 trigger operation (except for the definition of the RoIs) which should provide further suppression at the low P\({}_{\rm t}\) events that are reconstructed above the trigger threshold.

In the 20 GeV trigger operation, the trigger is \(\sim\) 95% efficient on the plateau and falls by roughly a factor of 100 at roughly 6 GeV below the trigger threshold. The 6 GeV operation for the barrel is reasonable good, being \(\sim\) 95% efficient on the plateau and 1%

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{P\({}_{\rm t}\) (GeV)} & Efficiency & RMS resolution & Gaussian resolution \\  & & Interval 0-40 GeV & \\ \hline
20 GeV barrel & 99.3 \(\pm\) 0.1 & 1.70 GeV & 0.786 GeV \\ \hline
20 GeV endcap & 98.9 \(\pm\) 0.1 & 1.96 GeV & 0.949 GeV \\ \hline
20 GeV barrel + 10\% RN & 92.4 \(\pm\) 0.3 & 3.07 GeV & 1.28 GeV \\ \hline
20 GeV endcap + 10\% RN & 96.0 \(\pm\) 0.2 & 3.11 GeV & 1.78 GeV \\ \hline \multicolumn{1}{|c|}{P\({}_{\rm t}\) (GeV)} & Efficiency & RMS resolution & Gaussian resolution \\  & & Interval 0-20 GeV & \\ \hline
6 GeV barrel & 99.0 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 0.708 GeV & 0.380 GeV \\ \hline
6 GeV endcap & 97.2 \(\pm\) 0.7 & 1.31 GeV & 0.526 GeV \\ \hline
6 GeV barrel + 10\% RN & 98.7 \(\pm\) 0.4 & 1.03 GeV & 0.444 GeV \\ \hline
6 GeV endcap + 10\% RN & 96.6 \(\pm\) 0.8 & 1.34 GeV & 0.605 GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Summary of Reconstruction Efficiency and Resolution Performanceefficient at 2 GeV below threshold. The endcap operation is more problematical and it was found that in order to achieve a good threshold resolution track quality cuts have to be imposed which reduce the efficiency on the plateau. The notorious bad regions around \(|\eta|=1.6\), where there is essentially no bending, inevitably degrade the trigger resolution. For this analysis the bad regions around \(|\eta|=1.6\,\pm\,0.1\) and \(\phi=0.4\,+\,\mathrm{m}\,\pi\,/4\,\pm\,0.1\) are masked. For the 6 GeV endcap operation we have imposed a track reconstruction quality cut which requires the \(\chi^{2}\) of the point-line circle fit to be good. We note some loss of plateau efficiency but the overall trigger threshold is much sharper than with no quality cut.

### Counting Rates

Of interest is the suppression of counting rate of the power law spectrum which will rain on the muon system in ATLAS beam operation [Ref.6]. To a good approximation the primordial \(P_{t}\) spectrum is flat in \(\eta\) and has a power law \(P_{t}\) dependence given by (parameterized from [Ref.6]):

\[\frac{d\sigma}{dP_{t}\,d\eta}\,\approx\,\frac{4.4\,\,\mathrm{x}\,\,10^{3}}{P_ {t}^{4.7}}\,\mathrm{\upmu b/GeV}, \tag{3}\]

where \(P_{t}\) is in (GeV) is the primordial \(P_{t}\) at the IP.

The response of the Level 2 trigger to this power law spectrum is shown in Fig. 11a for the barrel 20 GeV trigger regime and in Fig. 11b for the 20 GeV endcap. In this simulation we have neglected the suppression of the trigger rate afforded by the Level 1 trigger but have included the trigger chambers in the definition of the RoI. Two curves are shown for each region corresponding to no additional random noise and with 10% additional random noise. We note that since we have had to lower the trigger threshold for the noisy conditions the trigger becomes less efficient in suppressing the low \(P_{t}\) background. Nevertheless, the high counting rate associated with low \(P_{t}\) muons is effectively eliminated in the trigger.

The low \(P_{t}\) regime setting at a threshold \(P_{t}=6\) GeV is shown in Fig. 11c and 11d for the barrel and endcap regions, respectively. We note that there is considerable low-\(P_{t}\) leakage in the 6 GeV endcap simulation while the operation in the barrel region is acceptable. We are able to improve the operation of the 6 GeV endcap region by imposing track quality and topology cuts to accept only good circle fits in regions where there are at least 4 multiplayers participating in the circle fit. The performance under this condition is shown in Fig. 11e. However, we note that there is some loss of plateau efficiency as evidenced by the divergent 'True Rate' vs. trigger rates in the figure.

Table 2 is a summary of the Level 2 trigger performance under various conditions. Indicated is the trigger threshold values imposed at the various regions and noise conditions and the average \(\rm P_{t}\) for 0% and 10% additional random noise. The effect of imposing the quality and topology cuts is shown for the bottom 2 entries at 6 GeV where we note considerable improvement of performance. "Perfect Barrel" and "Perfect Endcap" are the estimated trigger rates for a fully efficient trigger with perfect resolution. The goal of a good Level 2 trigger is to be near the "perfect" standard.

6. Conclusions

A muon Level 2 trigger algorithm which operates in both the barrel and endcap regions has been developed. The preliminary results are promising. The algorithm has been demonstrated to reconstruct momenta at 6 and 20 GeV with efficiencies of \(>\) 97% and with resolutions of 10% at low \(P_{t}\) and 5% at high \(P_{t}\). Trigger rate suppressions of order 10\({}^{-2}\) for \(P_{t}\geq\) 20 GeV operation in both the barrel and endcaps are achieved. An acceptable suppression of 10\({}^{-2}\) for the \(P_{t}\geq\) 6 GeV operation in the barrel is obtained but a performance of only 10\({}^{-1}\) suppression at the \(P_{t}\geq\) 6 GeV in the endcaps is obtained unless track quality and topology cuts are imposed. Further studies will be conducted to analyze events with the Level 1 simulation operative in order to prefilter the data input to the Level 2 algorithm.
