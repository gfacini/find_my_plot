Measurement prospects for VBF \(H\!\!\rightarrow\!WW^{*}\!\rightarrow\!e\nu\mu\nu\) production with 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of HL-LHC \(pp\)-collisions

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note presents the prospects for the ATLAS experiment to observe and measure Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) Higgs-boson production, with the Higgs boson decaying into two \(W\) bosons in the High Luminosity LHC environment. The production of two forward jets in association with the Higgs boson, as well as the requirement that the \(W\) bosons both decay to leptons, provides a distinctive detector signature. The VBF production process has the second largest Higgs-boson production cross-section at the LHC and can be computed with small theoretical uncertainties. These properties allow for precision measurements in the High Luminosity LHC with 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of data. In addition, measurements of the VBF \(H\!\!\rightarrow\!WW^{*}\!\rightarrow\!e\nu\mu\nu\) process are sensitive to the reconstruction performance of its final-state features including missing transverse energy, leptons, and forward jets, and the reconstruction performance changes with the design of the upgraded ATLAS detector. The projected precision of the VBF Higgs-boson cross-section is shown for three upgrade detector scenarios, of which the "Reference" detector scenario is now the chosen baseline. The measurement precision on the production cross-section in the "Reference" detector scenario is about a factor of two better than in the "Low" detector scenario.

## 1 Introduction

At the LHC, the Vector Boson Fusion (VBF) process has the second highest cross section for Higgs-boson production after the gluon-fusion (ggF) process, occurring around a factor of 10 times less often at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. The Feynman diagram for these processes and their coupling vertices are shown in Figure 1. The VBF process produces forward jets with large dijet invariant mass, which provides a distinct signature that separates this process from many background processes. These forward jets are referred to as "tagging"-jets, and by selecting events with large invariant mass of the two tagging-jet system, a high signal-to-background ratio is achieved.

In this note, the \(m_{H}=125\) GeV VBF \(H\!\to\!WW^{*}\!\to\!ev\mu v\) channel is studied. The Higgs boson decaying to \(WW^{*}\) has a large branching fraction (22%) and has comparatively small background rates relative to the Higgs boson decaying to \(b\bar{b}\). The VBF production process has a direct coupling of the Higgs boson to the electroweak vector bosons and can be computed with small theoretical uncertainties compared to ggF Higgs-boson production, which has a heavy quark loop at leading order that makes its calculation more difficult [1, 2]. With large integrated luminosity, up to 3 ab\({}^{-1}\), at the High-Luminosity (HL) LHC [3, 4], the VBF process will be accessible for precision measurements.

Here the HL-LHC is assumed to collide protons at 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy with a 25 ns spacing between the proton bunches. A total integrated luminosity of 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of data is expected, with an average of 200 inelastic proton-proton collisions. This means there will be an average of 200 minimum-bias collisions concurrent with the relatively rare VBF Higgs-boson process, as well as effects on detector response from the collisions in neighbouring bunch crossings. The number of overlapping minimum-bias collisions and their in-time and out-of-time effects are together called pile-up. The jets coming from the signal-event collision are referred to as the hard-scatter jets, and the signal event is selected as the highest \(\Sigma p_{\rm T}^{2}\) vertex1 in each proton bunch crossing. The ability to distinguish pile-up and hard-scatter jets is essential for a precise measurement of the VBF Higgs-boson production cross-section.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The scalar sum of the transverse momentum (\(p_{\rm T}\)) is taken over all the tracks associated to the vertex.

Three detector scenarios for ATLAS, shown in Table 1, are considered in this paper, and they are the same scenarios presented in more detail in the Scoping Document for the ATLAS Phase-II upgrades [6]. The "Reference" scenario, which has been chosen as the baseline, is considered the best choice for physics, and there are two lower budget alternatives called the "Middle" and "Low" scenarios. Apart from the

differences in cost, two important differences in the detector scenarios are highlighted here. First, the tracking coverage in pseudorapidity2 contracts from \(|\eta|<3.8\) to \(<3.2\) and \(<2.7\) for the Reference, Middle, and Low scenarios, respectively. Not only does the \(|\eta|\) coverage change but also the tracking layout, which leads to differences in the rejection of jets initiated by light-flavour quarks changes. The goal of this note is to document the differences in precision of the VBF \(H\!\!\rightarrow\!WW^{*}\!\!\rightarrow\!ev\mu\nu\) cross-section measurement between three detector scenarios. The VBF \(H\!\!\rightarrow\!WW^{*}\!\!\rightarrow\!ev\mu\nu\) signal is useful to test detector layouts because of the many objects in its final-state signature which are affected by pile-up, including \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), forward jets, and the veto of central jets. The performance of the b-jet veto used to reject the dominant \(t\bar{t}\) background also changes in the different detector layouts.

Footnote 2: The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

The measured cross-section of the VBF \(H\!\!\rightarrow\!WW^{*}\) signal is divided by the Standard Model (SM) expectation, creating a unitless parameter called the signal strength (\(\upmu\)). The signal strength is 1 for Higgs-boson production at the SM rate. For comparison, the Run-1 measurements, which combine the \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV data from 2011 and 2012, respectively, yield an expected determination of the VBF Higgs-boson signal strength of \(1^{+0.59}_{-0.49}\)[5]. That analysis uses a multivariate technique called a boosted decision tree (BDT) and includes the same-flavour final state (two electrons or two muons); however, neither of these are used for this note. Here the Monte Carlo (MC) sample size is not large enough to use a BDT, and the same-flavour final state is not used because of the large \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) background. The \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) background was already difficult to remove with an average of 20 pile-up collisions in the 8 TeV dataset, and the increased pile-up in the HL-LHC scenario greatly degrades the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) resolution, making it even more difficult to remove. Thus the same-flavour events are only expected to add a few percent improvement to the precision of \(\upmu\) and are not used in this note.

In Ref. [7], the projection for the VBF \(H\!\!\rightarrow\!WW^{*}\!\!\rightarrow\!ev\mu\nu\) process is studied at a lower pile-up scenario of 140 collisions per bunch crossing. The results in this paper are not directly comparable because of the higher pile-up scenario of 200 collisions per bunch crossing as well as differences in the pile-up jet treatment. Here event-level kinematic correlations between pile-up jets are modelled by fully simulating events with an average of 200 minimum-bias collisions and then overlaying the reconstructed jets in those events on top of the hard-scatter process. Since pile-up jets are often produced in pairs (i.e. di-jet production), this results in two jets pointing in opposite \(\phi\) directions in the detector, which can be used to further reject pile-up jets. The pile-up jet simulation in Ref. [7] accounted only for the pile-up jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and multiplicity.

Sections of this note are organised in the following manner. The simulation samples used are shown in Section 2.1, and the steps taken to simulate the HL-LHC environment are discussed in Section 2.2. The selection criteria are discussed in Section 2.3, with the resulting signal region yields and the expected signal-strength precision shown in Section 3. These results are also given in the Scoping Document [6]. The precision of the Higgs-boson signal strength is reported with different assumptions for the signal

## 2 Analysis procedure and event selection

Given the large number of background processes that contribute to the signal region and the broadly peaking signal, MC modelling is an important aspect of the analysis. Not all of the background samples have been generated with the necessary sample size in 14 centre-of-mass energy collisions, as resources are limited. For this note, only 8 centre-of-mass energy simulation is used, and it is extrapolated to 14. The particle-level objects in the simulation are smeared to match the expected detector response for jets and ; however, the electrons and muons use the fully-simulated detector objects from the 8 dataset in 2012 with the ATLAS detector. The generation of the 8 samples and their cross-section scaling to 14 are discussed in Section 2.1. Then the kinematic extrapolations from 8 to 14 collisions as well as simulation of HL-LHC trigger and physics object measurements are discussed in Section 2.2. The event selection criteria are shown in Section 2.3, and the expected uncertainties are presented in Section 2.4.

### Monte Carlo samples

This section discusses the generation of the MC simulation at 8 centre-of-mass energy, and the descriptions closely follow that of Ref. [5]. All 8 samples and normalisations come from Ref. [5]. The generator and the cross-section times branching fraction for all signal and background processes are shown in Table 2, and the ratio of their cross-sections at 14 to 8, which is computed with Madgraph[8], is also shown. Each cross-section times branching fraction used in this note is the product of the 8 value multiplied by the ratio of cross-sections at 14 to 8. For, the cross-section is calculated at next-to-next-to-leading order in (NNLO) with resummation of higher-order terms to the next-to-next-to-leading logarithms (NNLL), evaluated with top++2.0[9]. The ratio of NNLO+NNLL cross-sections at 14 to 8 is observed to be within 5% of the same ratio determined with Madgraph. The scaling of the cross-section for, 14 is computed with Sherpa[10].

The VBF production mode for the signal is modelled with Powheg +Pythia 8[11, 12] at, and the VH process, which is considered as signal in this note, is modelled with Pythia 8. Gluon-fusion Higgs-boson production is treated as a background and modelled with Powheg +Pythia 8.

Cross-sections at 8 are calculated for the dominant diboson and top-quark processes as follows: the inclusive cross section is calculated to NLO with mcfm[13], non-resonant gluon-fusion is calculated and modelled to leading order in (LO) with gg2vv[14], including both and production and their interference; production, as noted above, is normalised to the calculation at NNLO order in with resummation of higher-order terms to the NNLL logarithms, evaluated with top++2.0[9]; and single-top-quark processes are normalised to NNLL following the calculations from Refs. [15, 16], and [17] for the -channel, -channel, and processes, respectively.

For,, and production via non-resonant vector-boson scattering (VBS), the Sherpa[10] generator provides the LO cross-section and is used for event modelling. The negligible contribution from VBS process is not shown in the table but is included in the background modelling for completeness.

The process \(W\gamma^{*}\) is defined as associated \(W+Z/\gamma^{*}\) production, where there is an opposite-charge same-flavour lepton pair with invariant mass \(m_{\ell\ell}\) less than 7 \(\GeV\). This process is modelled using Sherpa with up to one additional parton. The range \(m_{\ell\ell}>\)7 \(\GeV\) is simulated with Powheg +Pythia 8 and normalised to the Powheg cross-section.

The \(W\gamma\) and Drell-Yan processes are modelled using Alpgen +Herwig[18, 19] with merged tree-level calculations of up to five partons. The merged samples are normalised to the NLO calculation of mcfm (for \(W\gamma\)) or the NNLO calculation of DYNNLO [20, 21] (for \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)). The \(W\gamma\) sample is generated with the requirements \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}>\)8 \(\GeV\)and \(\Delta R(\gamma,\ell)>0.25\).

The \(W\)+jets background is estimated using a data-driven method based on the procedure used in the analysis of Run-1 data, as shown in Ref. [5]. The resulting \(W\)+jets prediction at 8 \(\TeV\) is scaled by a factor of 1.81 corresponding to the increase in its cross-section from 8 to 14 \(\TeV\). It was not possible to generate a sufficient number of simulated events to model this background in greater detail.

### Treatment of backgrounds and simulation

Extrapolating the kinematics of the 8 TeV centre-of-mass energy MC samples in Table 2 to 14 TeV is done by proton parton-distribution-function (PDF) reweighting. This applies an event-level weight that depends on the momentum fraction of the colliding partons, so the distribution of these momentum fractions changes from 8 to 14 TeV. The performance of the ATLAS detector in the high pile-up environment of the HL-LHC is simulated using the physics object performance recommendations in Ref. [6, 22]. These recommendations include the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) resolution and scale estimates for jets, electrons, and muons. In addition, the detector response is simulated for pile-up jets, jet b-tagging, and trigger acceptance. These performance recommendations change for the Low, Middle, and Reference scenarios, which are briefly defined in Table 1.

An anti-\(k_{t}\) clustering algorithm [23] is used to form particle-level jets from the stable particles remaining after hadronisation. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of generator-level anti-\(k_{t}\) jets is Gaussian-smeared to match the expected detector resolution for the pile-up environment of 200 collisions per bunch crossing. The Gaussian width is around 11 GeV for central jets (\(|\eta|<0.8\)) with \(30<p_{\mathrm{T}}<40\) GeV. The b-tagging performance assumes a 70% b-jet efficiency working point with the light-jet "mistag" rate discussed in Ref. [6]. The mistag rate is around a factor of two times higher in the Low scenario than in the Reference scenario for jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=35\) GeV.

The pile-up jet treatment comes from a sample of fully-simulated minimum-bias events generated with 200 inelastic collisions overlaid per bunch crossing; the jets from these events are overlaid on top of the signal and background MC simulated events. To mitigate the effect of jets originating from pile-up vertices, tracks are used to associate jets to their collision vertices along the beamline, and a requirement on the jet-vertex-tagger [24] is made. The efficiency for this selection is measured in a fully-simulated sample for hard-scatter and pile-up jets. The resulting efficiencies are applied to the smeared truth jets and the overlaid pile-up jets. This pile-up jet removal is simulated for each detector scenario, and the largest changes come from the differences in \(|\eta|\) coverage for the detector scenarios. This procedure has a pile-up jet efficiency of 2% within the tracking volume.

The missing transverse momentum measures the momentum imbalance in the transverse plane of the detector resulting from undetected neutrinos and is reconstructed using the track-based method of Ref. [5]. The vector transverse momenta of tracks associated to the hard-scatter vertex are summed, and the tracks associated to jets and electrons are replaced with their calorimeter measurements to correct for high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) neutral particles. The negative of this transverse momentum vector is the missing transverse momentum, with magnitude \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). It is referred to as the jet-corrected track \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). To extrapolate the jet-corrected track \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) performance from the lower pile-up of the 8 TeV simulation to the HL-LHC conditions, the pile-up dependence of the resolution of the \(x\) and \(y\)-components of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) vector is computed in a simulated \(Z\to\mu\mu\) sample using events with no reconstructed jets. For each additional collision per bunch crossing, the resolution of the track-based \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is degraded by 0.033 GeV. In each event, the \(x\)- and \(y\)-components of the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) soft term are smeared to simulate the effects of pile-up. The jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) smearing for hard-scatter jets is propagated to the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) calculation, and the pile-up jets, which pass the pile-up jet removal, are added to the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) calculation.

The full 8 TeV simulation, with the 2012 detector layout, is used for both electron and muon reconstruction efficiencies, and the electron and muon objects from the simulation are used directly. Electrons satisfy the "medium" selection criteria [25], and muon candidates are identified by matching an inner detector track with an muon spectrometer track or segment [26].

### Event selection

The object and event selection closely follow the selections used for the _VBF cross-check analysis_ in Ref. [5]. Electrons and muons are required to be isolated and have transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>15\) GeV. The electrons and muons are restricted to \(|\eta|<2.47\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\), respectively. All jets are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV and are restricted to \(|\eta|<4.5\). To cope with the higher level of pile-up, the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold is set at 70 (60) GeV for the leading (subleading) jet. All jets are considered for the b-jet veto (\(N_{\mathrm{b-jet}}\) = 0) regardless of whether they pass the pile-up jet mitigation. After these selections, the signal efficiency for this selection is low, at around 58% in the Reference scenario. No correlation between jet b-tagging and pile-up jet removal was available; otherwise, the pile-up jet removal would have been applied to jets prior to counting the number of jets that are b-tagged.

The analysis uses an "OR" of single high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) electron or high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) muon triggers, and the efficiencies of these are emulated. The trigger \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds are 25 GeV for muon triggers and 25-28 GeV for electron triggers, depending on the detector scenario. Events with exactly two oppositely charged and different flavour (\(e\mu\)) leptons passing a set of quality selection criteria, defined in Ref. [5], are selected with the leading lepton being required to have a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) greater than 25-28 GeV, depending on the detector scenario. The invariant mass of the lepton pairs, \(m_{\ell\ell}\), is required to be larger than 10 GeV. The Drell-Yan and multi-jet backgrounds are suppressed by requiring the jet-corrected track \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) to be larger than 20 GeV. To reduce the backgrounds, the total transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{tot}}\), is computed as

\[p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{tot}}=|\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+\mathbf{p}_{ \mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead}}+\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{subled}}+\sum_{ \mathrm{j}}^{\mathrm{jets}}\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{j}}|, \tag{1}\]

where \(\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), \(\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{lead}}\), and \(\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{subled}}\) are the transverse momentum vectors for the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), leading and subleading leptons, respectively. The \(\sum_{\mathrm{j}}^{\mathrm{jets}}\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{j}}\) is the vector sum over transverse momentum of the jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV and passing the pile-up jet mitigation. Small \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{tot}}\) is required to remove mainly \(t\bar{t}\) background events having jets below the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) reconstruction threshold. To remove the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) \(\rightarrow\) \(\tau\tau\) background, events with reconstructed di-tau mass (\(m_{\tau\tau}\)) larger than 50 GeV are removed, where \(m_{\tau\tau}\) is calculated using the approximation that the neutrinos are collinear with the visible leptons and no other source of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is present [27].

The VBF topology is selected by requiring the leading two jets to have \(|\eta|>2\) in opposite hemispheres and the invariant mass of the two leading jets (\(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\)). VBF processes do not have color flow, which means that jet activity is suppressed, so events are removed if they have a jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV within the rapidity range spanned by the two leading jets. This selection is referred to as the "central jet veto" (CJV). Finally, the leptons from the Higgs-boson decay also tend to be between the two leading jets in rapidity for VBF processes, so events with leptons outside the rapidity gap of the leading two jets are removed.

The remaining selection criteria utilise the spin-0 nature of the Higgs boson and the V-A decay of the \(W\) bosons. First, the invariant mass of the lepton pairs in the signal tends to be lower than that of the backgrounds, so \(m_{\ell\ell}\) is required to be less than 60 GeV. The two leptons also tend to point in the same direction in the transverse plane of the detector, so the difference in the azimuthal angle between the two leptons (\(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\)) is required to be less than 1.8. Lastly, the invariant mass of the \(WW^{*}\) pair cannot be computed because of the two neutrinos in the final state; however, the \(\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the neutrinos is known. So the transverse mass from Ref. [28] is defined as

\[m_{\mathrm{T}}=\sqrt{(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell\ell}+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss} })^{2}-|\mathbf{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell\ell}+\mathbf{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}|^{2}}, \tag{2}\]where \(\mathbf{p}_{\rm T}^{\ell\ell}\) is the vector-summed transverse momentum of the two leptons and \(E_{\rm T}^{\ell\ell}\) is defined as \((p_{\rm T}^{\ell\ell})^{2}+m_{\ell\ell}^{2}\). This quantity has a kinematic edge at the Higgs-boson mass (\(m_{H}\)), so accounting for resolution effects, the \(m_{\rm T}\) is required to be less than \(1.07\times m_{H}\). The selection criteria are summarised in Table 3.

### Systematic uncertainties treatment

The theoretical uncertainties (in %) on the ggF and VBF Higgs-boson production taken from the Run-1 analysis as described in Ref. [5] are shown in Table 4. The uncertainties are split into the following: QCD-scale \(N_{\rm jet}\) cross-section, QCD acceptance, PDF, underlying event (UE) and parton shower (PS) model uncertainties. The QCD-scale \(N_{\rm jet}\) cross-section and acceptance uncertainties are derived by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales after the \(N_{\rm jet}\) and after the subsequent requirements, respectively. The PDF and UE/PS model uncertainties are estimated after a signal-region-like selection including the CJV requirement and are uncertainties on the acceptance.

Because these uncertainties may improve in the future, three scenarios are presented: using the uncertainties given in Table 4, reducing those uncertainties by a factor of one-half, and finally setting those uncertainties to zero.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c} Syst. unc. & ggF (\%) & VBF (\%) \\ \hline \hline QCD \(N_{\rm jet}\) cross-section & 43 & 1 \\ QCD acceptance & 4 & 4 \\ PDF & 8 & 3 \\ UE/PS & 9 & 3 \\ \hline Total & 44 & 6 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The experimental systematic uncertainties (e.g. jet energy scale and resolution, and the \(b\)-tagging efficiency) as well as the total uncertainties on top (the largest background) and \(Z\)+jets backgrounds are expected to be smaller with the increased data sample size. The uncertainties on the \(WW\) background are reduced because of the tighter event selection in this note, especially the \(m_{\rm jj}\) requirement, which results in a purer sample of VBS \(WW\) production. The VBS \(WW\) background has smaller theoretical uncertainties than the inclusive \(WW\) background. A summary of the total uncertainties per background process, along with a comparison to the equivalent Run-1 uncertainties [5], is listed in Table 5. These include detector-level and theoretical uncertainties as well as the statistical uncertainties coming from control regions.

## 3 Results

### Signal region yields

Table 6 presents the event yields for the Low, Middle and Reference detector scenarios after the selection criteria discussed in Section 2 have been applied. The VBF signal to background ratio decreases from 0.49 (Reference) to 0.33 (Middle) to 0.23 (Low). The amount of signal decreases from the Reference to the Low scenario, but the amount of background remains relatively constant in all three scenarios.

In the Middle and Low scenarios, the expected yield of VBF \(H\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WW^{*}\) in signal region, \(N_{\rm VBF}\), decreases in Table 6 because many pile-up jets are not suppressed in the smaller tracking volume. The pile-up jets appearing between the two tagging jets cause signal events to be rejected by the CJV, which leads to a lower signal acceptance. After the \(m_{\rm jj}\) selection, the efficiency for VBF \(H\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WW^{*}\) signal events to pass the CJV selection criteria decreases from 82% (Reference) to 59% (Middle) to 26% (Low) for the scenarios in Table 7.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c c c c c c c}
**Scoping scenario** & \(N_{\rm VBF}\) & \(N_{\rm bkg}\) & \(N_{\rm gSF}\) & \(N_{WW}\) & \(N_{VV}\) & \(N_{t\bar{t}}\) & \(N_{t}\) & \(N_{Z/\gamma^{*}+jets}\) & \(N_{W+jets}\) \\ \hline \hline Reference & 200 & 410 & 57 & 48 & 55 & 146 & 20 & 27 & 0 \\ Middle & 153 & 457 & 46 & 91 & 36 & 164 & 27 & 23 & 3 \\ Low & 93 & 408 & 51 & 104 & 10 & 141 & 17 & 37 & 2 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The background yields are summed together in the column labelled \(N_{\rm bkg}\).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c}  & \multicolumn{2}{c}{\(N_{\rm jet}\geq 2\)} \\ Bkg. process & 14 TeV (\%) & Run-1 (\%) \\ \hline \hline \(WW\) & 10 & 30 \\ \(VV\) & 10 & 20 \\ \(t\bar{t}\) & 10 & 33 \\ \(tW/tb/tqb\) & 10 & 33 \\ \(Z\)+jets & 10 & 20 \\ \(W\)+jets & 20 & 30 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Table 5: Total uncertainties (in %) for the background processes in this note for the HL-LHC, labelled as 14 TeV, and the corresponding uncertainties from the Run-1 analysis [5].

The amount of top-quark background (\(N_{t\bar{t}}+N_{t}\)) in Table 6 remains roughly constant in all three detector scenarios. In the Middle and Low scenarios, the worse pile-up jet rejection and decreased b-veto coverage tend to increase the \(t\bar{t}\) background; however, a lower acceptance for the CJV selection counteracts these increases.

The remaining backgrounds in Table 6 increase with the poorer pile-up jet rejection in the Middle and Low scenarios; however, some decrease as the electron trigger threshold increases from 25 to 28 GeV. The \(WW\) background increases significantly as more non-resonant \(WW\) production is accepted in the Middle and Low scenarios. These events primarily enter with one or more of the tagging jets coming from pile-up as shown in Appendix A.

Distributions including the rapidity gap between the two leading jets (\(|\,\Delta y_{jj}\,|\)), \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\), \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\), and \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) are shown in Figure 2 for the Reference detector scenario after the signal region selection. The background samples are stacked with the expected signal yield overlaid. The simulated \(WW\) sample is the largest one among the backgrounds, and statistical fluctuations are evident for those with smaller generated samples, especially for processes like \(VV\), ggF, and \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) which also have a low selection efficiency.

### Expected significance and signal-strength uncertainties

The signal strength uncertainty and the significance defined below are used as the metrics to compare the different detector scenarios. The systematic uncertainties used in calculating the significance and the uncertainty on the signal strength are discussed in Section 2.4. The statistical uncertainty on the MC sample size is neglected for the extraction of the precision on the signal strength and the significance.

The expected precision on the VBF \(H\!\!\rightarrow\!WW^{*}\!\!\rightarrow\!ev\mu\nu\) signal strength (\(\Delta_{\mathrm{\mu}}\)) is calculated with the event yields after the \(m_{\mathrm{T}}\) selection criterion using the signal strength (\(\mathrm{\mu}\)), which is computed as

\[\mu=\frac{N_{\mathrm{exp}}-N_{\mathrm{bkg}}}{N_{\mathrm{sig}}}. \tag{3}\]

The expected \(\mathrm{\mu}\) is 1 by construction. The variable \(N_{\mathrm{bkg}}\) is the total background yield, and \(N_{\mathrm{sig}}\) is the VBF \(H\!\!\rightarrow\!WW^{*}\!\!\rightarrow\!ev\mu\nu\) signal yield. Then \(N_{\mathrm{exp}}\) is the sum of \(N_{\mathrm{sig}}\) and \(N_{\mathrm{bkg}}\). The sources of uncertainties on the backgrounds listed in Table 4 or 5 are enumerated from \(i=0\) to \(N_{\mathrm{bkg}}^{\mathrm{sys}}\), and the signal uncertainties listed in Table 4 are enumerated from \(j=0\) to \(N_{\mathrm{sig}}^{\mathrm{sys}}\). The uncertainty on \(\mathrm{\mu}\) is computed as

\[\Delta_{\mathrm{\mu}}=\frac{\sqrt{N_{\mathrm{exp}}+\sum_{i=0}^{N_{\mathrm{bkg} }^{\mathrm{sys}}}\sigma_{i,\mathrm{bkg}}^{2}+\sum_{j=0}^{N_{\mathrm{sig}}^{ \mathrm{sys}}}\sigma_{j,\mathrm{sig}}^{2}}}{N_{\mathrm{sig}}}, \tag{4}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l|c c|c}
**Scoping scenario** & \(N_{\mathrm{jet}}\) & \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) selection & CJV selection & Efficiency \\ \hline \hline Reference & \(\geq 2\) & 346 & 282 & 82\% \\ Middle & \(\geq 2\) & 385 & 227 & 59\% \\ Low & \(\geq 2\) & 465 & 122 & 26\% \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: The expected VBF \(H\!\!\rightarrow\!WW^{*}\) signal event yields with 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of data are shown after the \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) and central jet veto (CJV) requirements, following the order described in Table 3. The relative efficiency of the CJV is shown for each of the three scoping scenarios.

where the sum over \(\sigma^{2}_{i,\,\rm bkg}\) includes the experimental and theoretical uncertainties on each background process. The individual background uncertainty \(\sigma_{i,\rm bkg}\) is computed by multiplying the expected background yield for background process \(i\), which is labeled \(N_{i,\,\rm bkg}\), by the fractional uncertainty from Table 4 or 5. The theoretical uncertainties on the Higgs-boson production, labelled \(\sigma_{j,\,\rm sig}\), come from the fractional uncertainties in Table 4 multiplied by the expected signal yield.

The individual background uncertainties are treated as uncorrelated in Eq. (4), but this is not strictly correct. For the VBF analysis in Ref. [5], adding the uncertainties in an uncorrelated manner is a conservative estimate, with the proper treatment resulting in a small reduction of approximately 5% in the total background uncertainties.

Figure 2: The (a) \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\), (b) \(m_{\rm T}\), (c) \(|\,\Delta y_{jj}\,|\), and (d) \(m_{\rm jj}\) distributions are shown with all signal region selections applied except for the one on the kinematic variable shown, and an arrow indicates the selection threshold. For \(|\,\Delta y_{jj}\,|\), the arrow indicates a minimum threshold from the \(|\eta_{j}|>2\) and opposite-hemisphere jet requirements. All distributions assume the Reference scenario detector performance.

The significance is also reported, and it is calculated for VBF signal by

\[\text{Significance}=\frac{N_{\text{sig}}}{\sqrt{N_{\text{bkg}}+\sum_{i=0}^{N_{ \text{bkg}}^{\text{vss}}}\sigma_{i,\text{bkg}}^{2}}} \tag{5}\]

with the same variable definition of \(\sigma_{i,\text{bkg}}\) as in Eq. (4).

The VBF significance and \(\Delta_{\mu}\) are shown for the three detector scenarios in Table 8, with the full, one-half, and none of the ggF and VBF Higgs-boson theoretical uncertainties from Table 4. The full background uncertainties from Table 5 are included in all estimates. Starting with the results using the full ggF and VBF Higgs-boson theoretical uncertainties, the significance is degraded by 23 (53)% from the Reference to the Middle (Low) scenario. The expected \(\Delta_{\mu}\) is increased by 25 (95)% from the Reference to the Middle (Low) scenario.

More precise cross-section calculations, a better understanding of the detector, and a larger sample size to measure the systematic effects should allow a reduction in systematic uncertainties. For ggF and VBF Higgs-boson theoretical uncertainties in Table 4 reduced by half, the significance in Table 8 is degraded by 27 (54)% from the Reference to the Middle (Low) scenario. The expected \(\Delta_{\mu}\) increases by 31 (100)% from the Reference to the Middle (Low) scenario. The results are also shown with no signal systematic uncertainties, and the expected \(\Delta_{\mu}\) increases from 43 (114)% Reference to the Middle (Low) scenario.

Comparing the full to no signal systematic uncertainties, the relative expected \(\Delta_{\mu}\) in the Low to that in the Reference scenario increases from 95% to 114%. Thus improved precision in the theoretical modeling increases the penalty for reducing the detector performance.

The optimisation of this analysis focuses on \(\Delta_{\mu}\), which results in significances of 3.3\(\sigma\), 5.2\(\sigma\), and 7.1\(\sigma\) observed in Table 8. It is possible to tighten the selection criteria for all three scenarios to obtain more than 5\(\sigma\), but the goal of this analysis is to obtain the best \(\Delta_{\mu}\).

## 4 Cross checks

### Analysis optimisation with forward tracker

The uncertainty on the signal strength, \(\Delta_{\mu}\), which is defined in Equation 4, is used to find the optimal \(m_{\text{jj}}\), \(\mid\Delta y_{jj}\mid\), CJV, leading jet \(p_{\text{T}}\), and sub-leading jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) thresholds for the Low, Middle and Reference scenarios. Of the variables used for event selection, \(m_{\text{jj}}\), \(\mid\Delta y_{jj}\mid\), and the CJV are most affected by

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c c c|c c c|} \hline
**Scoping scenario** & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{\(\Delta_{\mu}\)} & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{**Significance (\(\sigma\))**} \\ Signal unc. & Full & 1/2 & None & Full & 1/2 & None \\ \hline Reference & 0.20 & 0.16 & 0.14 & 5.7 & 7.1 & 8.0 \\ \hline Middle & 0.25 & 0.21 & 0.20 & 4.4 & 5.2 & 5.4 \\ \hline Low & 0.39 & 0.32 & 0.30 & 2.7 & 3.3 & 3.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: The expected \(\Delta_{\mu}\) and significance are shown for the three scoping scenarios considering the same, one-half, and none of the theoretical systematic uncertainties on the VBF and ggF Higgs-boson production taken from Table 4.

increased pile-up. The optimisations are performed on "N-1" distributions in which only the studied variable has its selection criteria removed, and then the threshold values are scanned. The same level of theoretical systematic uncertainties on the VBF and ggF Higgs-boson production presented in Table 4 are used for each detector scenario. The results are shown in Figure 3.

The \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}\) optimisation indicates a lower threshold of \(m_{\mathrm{jj}}>1.25\) TeV is close to optimal for the Reference scenario, but tighter selection criteria could be applied to gain some improvement, especially in the Low scenario. However, these points are limited by the MC sample size. The \(|\,\Delta y_{jj}\,|\) optimisation in Figure 3(b) indicates little to no improvement from applying this selection criterion. In Figure 3(c), the CJV has its best performance at the lowest available jet threshold of 30 GeV. Lower jet-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds were not available in the performance recommendations. In Figure 3(d), the leading-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold continues to reduce the \(\Delta_{\mu}\) up to 140 GeV, but the number of events passing the selection in the MC sample becomes very small above 140 GeV. The sub-leading jet-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold and the \(\Delta\phi_{\ell\ell}\) selection criterion, which are not shown here, do not substantially affect \(\Delta_{\mu}\).

These studies demonstrate that the selection criteria in Table 3 are close to optimal for the Reference scenario. The studies also demonstrate that the differences in \(\Delta_{\mu}\) between the Reference, Middle, and Low scenarios are generally not smaller than with the selection criteria in Table 3.

### Restricting jet \(|\eta|\) selection

The measurements in this document aim to use the full ATLAS acceptance for jets (\(|\eta|<4.5\)); however, restricting the jet acceptance to \(|\eta|<3.8\) and lowering the jet \(p_{T}\) threshold to 50 GeV reduces the \(\Delta_{\mu}\) by 37% for the Reference scenario. The degradation of the Middle detector scenario relative to the Reference scenario remains around 30%, even when optimizing on the jet \(|\eta|\) acceptance for the smaller tracking volume. The Low scenario has a smaller tracking volume still, so it is not possible to improve its \(\Delta_{\mu}\) relative to the nominal selection by further restricting the jet \(|\eta|\).

### Results with pile-up of 140

Different running conditions for the HL-LHC are being considered, including running at a lower pile-up of 140 inelastic collisions per bunch crossing. In a lower pile-up scenario, the physics-object reconstruction and resolution improve and the number of pile-up jets is reduced. The VBF significance and \(\Delta_{\mu}\) for the three detector scenarios are again compared in this lower pile-up environment. The results are shown in Table 9 assuming the signal theoretical uncertainties from Table 4 scaled by a factor of one-half. The significance is degraded by 14 (49)% from the Reference to the Middle (Low) scenario. The expected \(\Delta_{\mu}\) is increased by 15 (77)% from the Reference to the Middle (Low) scenario. For pile-up of 140 inelastic collisions per bunch crossing, the decrease in performance between the detector scenarios is not as large as for the pile-up of 200 collisions shown in Table 8, but there is still a significant difference.

### Comparison to Run-1 results

The results in this note are compared to the Run-1 analysis in Ref. [5], which presents both a multivariate analysis and a cut-based analysis as a cross-check. The observed signal strength uncertainty for the multivariate analysis is \(\Delta_{\mu}=0.42\), which is comparable to the \(\Delta_{\mu}=0.39\) for the Low detector scenario in Table 8. A signal to background ratio of 1.6 for events with \(m_{\rm jj}>1\) TeV was achieved in the cut-based analysis, which provides the most appropriate comparison to the results in this note. Part of the difference between the results in this note and the Run-1 analysis can be explained by the lower b-jet rejection of 70% while the Run-1 analysis [5] used 85%. Applying an 85% rejection rate in the Reference scenario, the signal to background is increased from 0.49 to 0.98. The remaining differences are explained by improved rejection in the Run-1 analysis due to a lower sub-leading lepton \(p_{\rm T}\) of 10 GeV, a central jet veto that goes down to 20 GeV to reject more \(t\bar{t}\), and a b-tag veto on jets down to 20 GeV.

The results for this channel are also presented for a pile-up scenario of 140 collisions in Ref. [7], and the precision on the signal strength was projected to be 15% for 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of 14 TeV data with no signal theory

Figure 3: Optimisation of the uncertainty on the signal strength (\(\Delta_{\mu}\)) as a function of \(m_{\rm jj}\), \(|\,\Delta y_{jj}\)\(|\), CJV, and the lead jet \(p_{\rm T}\) for all three detector scenarios. For each kinematic variable the selection on that variable is removed; in the case of \(|\,\Delta y_{jj}\)\(|\), the \(|\eta_{j}|<2\) and opposite-hemisphere requirements are removed. The lower panel shows the ratio of each detector scenario (Seen.) to the Reference (Ref.) scenario.

uncertainties. The results of this note supersede those in Ref. [7] because of the more rigorous treatment of pile-up jets in this note.

## 5 Conclusions

This study of VBF \(H\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WW^{*}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(e\nu\mu\nu\) production at the HL-LHC with an average of 200 pile-up collisions achieves a precision of 14% on the Higgs-boson signal strength with 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of 14 TeV HL-LHC data. Detector configurations with reduced performance relative to the baseline Reference scenario result in larger uncertainties: the Middle scenario has a precision of 20%, and the Low scenario obtains 30% precision. This corresponds to relative deterioration of approximately 25% and 95% in the expected uncertainty on the Higgs-boson signal strength (\(\Delta_{\mathrm{H}}\)) for the Middle and Low scenarios relative to the Reference scenario, respectively. Most of the degradation from the Low and Middle scenarios comes from poorer pile-up jet rejection due to the reduced tracking volume. The ATLAS collaboration has chosen the Reference detector scenario as the baseline for future studies.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline
**Scoping scenario** & \(\Delta_{\mathrm{H}}\) & **Significance (\(\sigma\))** \\ Signal unc. & 1/2 & 1/2 \\ \hline Reference & 0.13 & 9.0 \\ \hline Middle & 0.15 & 7.7 \\ \hline Low & 0.23 & 4.6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 9: The \(\Delta_{\mathrm{H}}\) and significance are shown for the three scoping scenarios with a pile-up of 140 inelastic collisions per bunch crossing. The theoretical systematic uncertainties on the VBF and ggF Higgs-boson production are taken from Table 4 and scaled by one-half.

## Appendix A Generator-level performance plots

The number of generator-level jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV in events passing the signal-region selection is shown in Figure 4. The sub-leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold is lowered to 40 GeV to increase the sample size. The VBF \(H\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WW^{*}\) signal has the largest contribution of events with two generator-level jets in the Reference scenario, and signal selection efficiency progressively increases from Low to Middle to Reference. The efficiency increase for events with two generator-level jets is not as clearly observed in \(t\bar{t}\) in the Reference scenario, but the Middle scenario does see a large increase. The \(t\bar{t}\) acceptance does not increase as much as VBF \(H\)\(\rightarrow\)\(WW^{*}\) because the central jet veto reduces the background with three or more generator-level jets. Finally, the QCD \(WW\) process does not typically have two hard-scatter jets, so it is a reducible background in the VBF 2-jet selection, entering primarily due to pile-up jets. The Reference scenario better rejects this reducible background as shown in Figure 4(c), with fewer events having zero generator-level jets (i.e. two pile-up jets) observed in the Reference scenario.
