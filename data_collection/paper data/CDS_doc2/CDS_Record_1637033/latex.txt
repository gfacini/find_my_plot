###### Abstract

Five small prototype micromegas detectors were positioned in the ATLAS detector during LHC running at \(\sqrt{s}=8\,\mathrm{TeV}\). A \(9\times 4.5\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) two-gap detector was placed in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter and four \(9\times 10\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) detectors on the ATLAS Small Wheels, the first station of the forward muon spectrometer. The one attached to the calorimeter was exposed to interaction rates of about \(70\,\mathrm{kHz}/\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) at ATLAS luminosity \(\mathcal{L}=5\times 10^{33}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\) two orders of magnitude higher than the rates in the Small Wheel. We compare the currents drawn by the detector installed in front of the electromagnetic calorimeter with the luminosity measurement in ATLAS experiment.

Introduction

In order to test the micromegas detectors[1, 2] under realistic LHC conditions five small micromegas chambers were installed in the ATLAS detector in February 2012 (see Figures 2 and 2). A two-gap detector (named MBT) with an active area of \(9\times 4.5\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) was installed in the high-rate environment in front of the electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter, \(3.5\,\mathrm{m}\) from the interaction point in the \(z\) direction, at a radius \(r\sim 1\,\mathrm{m}\). The other four detectors were installed on the Small Wheel (SW) at \(1.8\,\mathrm{m}\) distance from the beam pipe.

In this note we study the correlation of the MBT current and the ATLAS luminosity.

## 2 Chamber Characteristics

The MBT chamber has a double drift gap of \(4.5\,\mathrm{mm}\) (see Figure 3), an amplification gap of \(0.128\,\mathrm{mm}\) and two-dimensional readout with \(500\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) pitch (\(400\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) width) of the x strips (in \(\eta\)-direction) and \(1.3\,\mathrm{mm}\) pitch (\(200\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) width) of the v strips which are inclined with respect to the x strips by \(30^{\circ}\). The common drift plane is a thin FR4 sheet with Cu coating on both sides. The MBT chamber is a resistive-strip type micromegas with a resistivity of about \(300\,\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{cm}\) and a resistance of \(100\,\mathrm{M}\Omega\). The resistive strips are \(100\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) wide and \(4.5\,\mathrm{cm}\) long and have a pitch of \(250\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\). They are oriented along the x strips. The detector is operated with the drift high voltage (HV) at \(-300\,\mathrm{V}\) (\(0.67\,\mathrm{k}\mathrm{V}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{cm}\) electric drift field) and an amplification HV applied to the resistive strips of \(+500\,\mathrm{V}\) (\(39\,\mathrm{k}\mathrm{V}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{cm}\) electric amplification field) while the mesh was connected to ground. The hit rate measured in the MBT chamber is about \(70\,\mathrm{kHz}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) for a luminosity of \(5\times 10^{33}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), with \(90\%\) of the hits being correlated in both gaps. The hit rate in the chambers on the Small Wheel is more than two orders of magnitude lower, with most of the hits being uncorrelated.

All chambers were operated with an Ar:CO\({}_{2}\) (\(93\):\(7\)) gas mixture and read out, stand-alone, by APV25 hybrid cards through the Scalable Readout System[3]. They were operational from March 2012 to February 2013, except for a few weeks with low luminosity running. The high voltage was kept on the same value independent of the LHC beam conditions (early beam, single bunches, large emittance beam, \(25\,\mathrm{ns}\) LHC beams, etc). The detector currents were monitored through the CAEN SY1527 HV system us ing the A1821 HV module with a monitor current resolution of 2 nA (see Figure 4). Unfortunately the monitoring data after September 2012 were lost due to a technical problem.

## 3 Data

Figure 5 shows the MBT current together with the ATLAS luminosity for one day of data taking.

Figure 6 shows the correlation between the MBT current and the ATLAS luminosity for the whole dataset. Performing a linear fit, we extract an intercept of \(-6\) nA and a slope of 0.56 \(\upmu\)A/\(10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\).

We observe that for higher values of luminosity the data fall below the linear extrapolation from the low luminosity data. We examine this behavior by fitting our data in slices of MBT current. We select six bins of 0.05 \(\upmu\)A starting from 0.05 \(\upmu\)A to 0.35 \(\upmu\)A and we fit the micromegas current versus ATLAS luminosity data. Figure 7 shows the corresponding slopes as a function of MBT currents. This figure clearly shows that for higher luminosity the MBT current is no longer linear. The linearity of the MBT current as a function of the ATLAS luminosity (Figure 6) was examined by taking six slices of the MBT

current and fitting the 2D correlations of the MBT current versus the ATLAS luminosity. The extracted slopes of the linear fit as a function of the central value of the MBT current is shown in Figure 7. The data points shows a decrease of the slope at higher MBT currents. This effect is expected by the voltage drop along the resistive strips because of the high strip resistivity (\(300\,\mathrm{M}\Omega/\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}\)) and the base resistance of \(100\,\mathrm{M}\Omega\). At the highest observed rates, we expect an average voltage drop of about \(1\,\mathrm{V}\) which translates into a gas gain drop of \(4\%\). The MBT gas gain as a function of the amplification HV was measured in the laboratory using an X-ray gun producing a Cu spectrum line of \(8\,\mathrm{k}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\). The measured gas gain at \(500\,\mathrm{V}\) amplification HV is about \(6000\). The measured gas gain drop is compatible with the observed slope variation at high MBT currents (Figure 7).

The correlation between the MBT current, properly corrected for the gain drop, and the ATLAS luminosity allows us to use the micromegas for luminosity measurement along with LUCID and BCM[5]. In particular using resistive strips with lower resistivity the high voltage drop could be reduced to retain the linear correlation between the MBT and the ATLAS luminosity at very high values of MBT current.

In this analysis we have used \(15\,\mathrm{f}\mathrm{b}^{-1}\) integrated LHC luminosity that corresponds to four month data taking period during 2012. Using the correlation of MBT current with ATLAS luminosity (\(23.3\,\mathrm{f}\mathrm{b}^{-1}\)), it is estimated that the total charge accumulated by the MBT chamber during the 2012-2013 data taking adds up to about \(1.2\,\mathrm{C}\) or \(0.03\,\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}^{2}\). This figure should be compared to an accumulated charge of \(0.005\,\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}^{2}/\mathrm{year}\) that is expected in the micromegas operating at a gas gain of \(10^{4}\) at a rate of \(10\,\mathrm{k}\mathrm{H}\mathrm{z}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}^{2}\), the highest counting rate expected on the Small Wheel. In other words, the one year long exposure of the MBT chambers located on the front face of the electromagnetic calorimeter is equivalent to six years of operating the micromegas on the New Small Wheel[4] at a luminosity of \(\mathcal{L}=5\times 10^{34}\,\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\).

The measurement also shows that the micromegas chamber shows no evidence of ageing as the current drawn is stable as a function of time for various ATLAS luminosity slices. As shown in Figure 8 for three different ranges of luminosity (\(0.20-0.21,\ 0.30-0.31\) and \(0.40-0.41\times 10^{34}\,\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\)) the micromegas current are found to be constant between May and end of August 2012, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of \(15\,\mathrm{f}\mathrm{b}^{-1}\) or \(0.02\,\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}^{2}\) or \(4\) years of running at \(\mathcal{L}=5\times 10^{34}\,\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\).

Using the radiation monitoring systems in the ATLAS experiment[6] we can estimate the total dose that the electronics have been exposed to. We calculate that the accumulated dose is approximately

26 krad. No sign of malfunctions of the electronics has been observed. The read out APV25 hybrid cards of the MBT chambers are still operational.

We estimate the uncertainty of the luminosity measurement based on the micromegas current by taking the horizontal residual of every datapoint from the fitted line (see Figure 7). This value (\(\delta\mathcal{L}\)) is then divided by our measurement \(\mathcal{L}\) as can be seen as a function of luminosity \(\mathcal{L}\) in Figure 9. In Figure 10 the \(\delta\mathcal{L}/\mathcal{L}\) is plotted. By fitting this distribution we get a mean value of 0.040. We conclude that we can estimate the ATLAS luminosity based on the micromegas currents with an uncertainty of \(\delta\mathcal{L}/\mathcal{L}=\pm 4.0\,\%\). Furthermore by taking into account the ATLAS luminosity error[7] (\(\delta\mathcal{L}/\mathcal{L}\))\({}_{\rm ATLAS}=\pm 3.6\,\%\) we conclude that the final uncertainty of the luminosity estimated by the MBT current measurement is \(\delta\mathcal{L}/\mathcal{L}=\pm 1.7\,\%\).

## 4 Summary

We have operated five micromegas detectors in a high-rate environment of the ATLAS cavern in front of the electromagnetic end-cap calorimeter for a year. We have observed a strong correlation between the LHC luminosity and the current drawn by the micromegas detectors. This leads to the conclusion that we could use the micromegas detectors to monitor the LHC luminosity in the ATLAS cavern with an uncertainty of \(\delta\mathcal{L}/\mathcal{L}=\pm 1.7\%\).
