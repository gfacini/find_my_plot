###### Abstract

As soon as a significant signal in one of the Higgs boson discovery channels is observed, it has to be confirmed that this is really from a Higgs boson and is in agreement with the predictions of the standard model.

Based on all ATLAS studies done for a standard model Higgs boson, a global Maximum Likelihood fit is performed to determine the expected accuracy on the measurement of the Higgs boson coupling parameters in the mass range from 110 GeV to 190 GeV. Depending on the theoretical assumptions different sets of coupling parameters are extracted.

## 1 Motivation

During the last years it has been shown that a standard model Higgs boson with a mass ranging from 110 GeV to \(\sim\)1 TeV can be discovered within the first few years of the ATLAS experiment. However, observing a surplus of events in one of the Higgs boson discovery channels is not sufficient to prove the existence of the Higgs boson. To do this, the spin and CP-eigenvalue of the observed particle must be determined and its couplings to the known particles of the standard model have to be measured. This note evaluates to which precision these coupling parameters of the Higgs boson can be measured.

Due to the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking the couplings of the Higgs boson to the weak bosons (\(W^{\pm}\) and \(Z\)) are directly given by the mass of these bosons. The coupling constants \(g_{W}\) and \(g_{Z}\) are

\[g_{W} = \frac{2\,m_{W}^{2}}{v} \tag{1}\] \[g_{Z} = \frac{2\,m_{Z}^{2}}{v}\quad,\]

### Probability function for the experimental studies

Each study is described by a Poisson function that gives the probability to see \(N=N_{S}+N_{B}\) events after all cuts, if \(\lambda_{S+B}(\vec{x})\) events can be expected for a given set of parameters \(\vec{x}\)

\[\mbox{POISSSON}\left(N,\lambda_{S+B}(\vec{x})\right)\quad. \tag{3}\]

The parameters \(\vec{x}\) contain the Higgs boson coupling parameters and all the quantities that have a systematic uncertainty (luminosity, detector efficiencies, theoretical uncertainties; see section 3).

In addition the number of background events after all cuts can be extrapolated from regions in phase space where only a few signal events are expected. If \(N_{N}\) events are observed in these regions of phase space, the number of expected background events \(\lambda_{B}(\vec{x})\) is given by:

\[\lambda_{B}(\vec{x}) = \alpha_{B}\cdot N_{N}\quad, \tag{4}\]

where \(\alpha_{B}\) is the extrapolation factor. In most cases \(\alpha_{B}\) has to be determined from Monte Carlo studies and has some systematic uncertainty which is described by an Gaussian probability function (see next section). The statistical fluctuations of the \(N_{N}\) observed events for the background normalisation is described by a Poisson function:

\[\mbox{POISSSON}\left(N_{N},\frac{\lambda_{B}(\vec{x})}{\alpha_{B}}\right)\quad. \tag{5}\]

The resulting probability function \(P_{i}(\vec{x})\) for the \(i\)th study is given by:

\[P_{i}\left(\vec{x}\right) = \mbox{POISSSON}\left(N_{i},\lambda_{i,S+B}(\vec{x})\right)\cdot \mbox{POISSSON}\left(N_{i,N},\frac{\lambda_{i,B}(\vec{x})}{\alpha_{i,B}}\right)\quad. \tag{6}\]

For most of the studies the signal and the background have contributions from more than one channel:

\[\lambda_{i,S}(\vec{x})=\sum_{j\in S}\lambda_{i,j}(\vec{x})\quad,\;\;\lambda_{i,B}(\vec{x})=\sum_{j\in B}\lambda_{i,j}(\vec{x})\quad. \tag{7}\]

The expected number of events in each channel \(j\) is:

\[\lambda_{i,j}(\vec{x})=\left(\sigma\cdot\mbox{BR}\right)_{j}\left(\vec{x} \right)\cdot\eta_{i,j}\cdot L\cdot\epsilon_{1}\cdot\cdots\cdot\epsilon_{k}\quad, \tag{8}\]

where \(\eta_{i,j}\) is the acceptance of channel \(j\) to pass all cuts in the study \(i\). The integrated luminosity \(L\) and the efficiencies \(\epsilon_{1}\ldots\epsilon_{k}\) are systematic uncertainties for this study/channel.

For signal channels the product \(\left(\sigma\cdot\mbox{BR}\right)_{j}\left(\vec{x}\right)\) is a function of the Higgs boson coupling parameters. Depending on the theoretical assumptions different expressions for \(\left(\sigma\cdot\mbox{BR}\right)_{j}\left(\vec{x}\right)\) are chosen (see section 5).

For background channels the product \(\left(\sigma\cdot\mbox{BR}\right)_{j}\left(\vec{x}\right)\) is treated as a systematic uncertainty (see section 3).

### Probability function for systematic uncertainties

Any number \(\epsilon\) with a systematic uncertainty is treated as a free parameter within the fit. It is constrained to the nominal value \(\tilde{\epsilon}\) by a Gaussian probability function \(\text{GAUS}(\epsilon,\tilde{\epsilon},\Delta\tilde{\epsilon})\), where \(\Delta\tilde{\epsilon}\) is the assumed error on \(\tilde{\epsilon}\).

An example for such a number with a systematic uncertainty is the integrated Luminosity \(L\). \(L\) is constrained to the measured integrated Luminosity \(\tilde{L}\) by the Gaussian probability function \(\text{GAUS}(L,\tilde{L},\Delta\tilde{L})\), where \(\Delta\tilde{L}\) is the estimated total error on the measurement of \(\tilde{L}\).

A list of all systematic uncertainties is given in section 3.

### Total likelihood function

The total probability function for \(n_{\text{studies}}\) experimental studies and \(n_{\text{syst.}}\) systematic uncertainties \(\epsilon_{j}\) is given by:

\[P\left(\vec{x}\right) = \prod_{i=1}^{n_{\text{studies}}}P_{i}\left(\vec{x}\right)\prod_{j= 1}^{n_{\text{syst.}}}\text{GAUS}(\epsilon_{j},\tilde{\epsilon_{j}},\Delta \tilde{\epsilon_{j}})\quad. \tag{9}\]

The total log likelihood function is:

\[L\left(\vec{x}\right)=\log\left[P\left(\vec{x}\right)\right]=\sum_{i=1}^{n_{ \text{studies}}}\log\left[P_{i}\left(\vec{x}\right)\right]\ +\ \sum_{j=1}^{n_{\text{syst.}}}\log\left[\text{GAUS}(\epsilon_{j},\tilde{ \epsilon_{j}},\Delta\tilde{\epsilon_{j}})\right]\quad. \tag{10}\]

Since all the experimental studies used are based on the standard model, the parameter combination \(\vec{x}\) that gives maximal \(L\left(\vec{x}\right)\) is exactly the combination describing the standard model.

The 1 \(\sigma\) error for a parameter \(x_{k}\) is given by the positive and negative variation \(\Delta^{\pm}x_{k}\) reducing \(L\left(\vec{x}\right)\) by \(\frac{1}{2}\) (while varying \(x_{k}\) the likelihood function \(L\left(\vec{x}\right)\) is minimized over all \(x_{i}\neq x_{k}\)). The errors \(\Delta^{\pm}x_{k}\) are in general asymmetric. Both are combined into a mean error \(\Delta x_{k}\) using the definition:

\[\Delta x_{k}:=\sqrt{\frac{(\Delta^{+}x_{k})^{2}+(\Delta^{-}x_{k})^{2}}{2}}\quad. \tag{11}\]

It should be noted that these 1 \(\sigma\) errors do not have to contain a 68% confidence interval, since the likelihood function is not strictly Gaussian and all coupling parameters are required to be positive. A correct treatment using confidence intervals as proposed by Feldman and Cousins [15] will be very challenging. The fit has to deal with up to 20 independently measured event numbers and up to 10 theoretical properties (e.g. couplings) that have to be extracted. Producing a confidence belt plot for this constellation will be very hard with current CPU and memory limitations.

All minimizations are done with Minuit [27], the numerical and symbolic calculations are based on GiNaC [16].

### Expectation values

This analysis is based on simulations for a standard model Higgs boson. Therefore, the number of events given for each channel at a given mass is the standard model expectation value (as predicted by leading order Monte Carlo simulations without K-factors).

Due to the statistical nature of the experiment the probability to see exactly this expected number of events in every channel is very small. The correct approach to determine the expectation values of the coupling parameters is to vary the number of events independently in every channel according to the corresponding Poisson distributions, do the global fit and then average over all the results. Unfortunately this approach is very time consuming and almost impossible to perform for all Higgs boson masses. Instead all fits in section 5 are based on the expectation values of the numbers of events in the respective studies. In section 6 the validity of this simplification is tested.

The expectation values of the numbers of events are in general non-integer. To take this into account, the Poisson probability distribution is modified by replacing the factorial by the gamma function:

\[{\rm POISSON}(r,\lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{r}}{r!}\quad\mbox{ for }r\in N_{0},r\geq 0\] \[{\rm POISSON}(r,\lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^{r}}{\Gamma(r+1)}\quad\mbox{ for }r\in R,r\geq 0\quad. \tag{12}\]

## 3 Systematic uncertainties

Altogether, there are four different sources of systematic uncertainties:

1. Detector: All uncertainties related to detector effects and properties are summarised in Table 2. These uncertainties are 100% correlated for the channels in which they occur when reconstructing the final state. The efficiency \(\epsilon_{D}\) is the overall detector efficiency shared by all studies, \(\epsilon_{\rm Tag}\) combines the uncertainty for the reconstruction of the tag-jets in the forward region of the calorimeter and the uncertainty on the central jet-veto (both needed for all WBF studies). \(\epsilon_{\rm Iso}\) gives the uncertainty on the lepton isolation used in all \(H\to ZZ\) studies to suppress the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) background. Not taken into account are all remaining uncertainties related to the absolute energy calibration and trigger effects, which cannot be included into the systematic errors of Table 2 (mainly uncertainties on \(E_{T}^{\rm miss.}\) and the jet energy scale). Without detailed systematic studies for all channels these effects cannot be included.

However, since this analysis is based on the assumption of a fully understood detector after 3 or more years of running, these remaining effects are hopefully small.
2. Background normalisation: In all channels the number of background events can be estimated by extrapolating the measured rate in a background dominated region of phase space (normalisation sample) into the signal region. Depending on the shape of the signal and the background processes, this extrapolation has some uncertainty, which has two sources: the statistical error of the normalisation sample and the systematic uncertainty for the extrapolation into the signal region (see section 2.1). Unfortunately no information on the sizes of normalisation samples can be found in the studies used for the fits, so this is estimated from the shape of the final distributions. This is done by giving an estimated factor \(f_{B}\) between the number of events in the normalisation region and the number of background events in the signal region. In the notation of section 2.1 the size \(N_{i,N}\) of the normalisation sample in the \(i\)th study is given by \(N_{i,N}=f_{i,B}\cdot N_{i,B}\), where \(N_{i,B}\) is the sum of all background events in the study. The systematic uncertainty of the extrapolation was studied only for GF \(H\ \rightarrow\ WW\)[20]. * \(H\to ZZ\to 4l\): For the \(H\to ZZ\) studies a final mass window cut (mass window width: 10 GeV to 20 GeV) at the position of the Higgs Boson resonance peak is used. In the range of invariant 4-lepton masses between 110 GeV and 180 GeV the background is almost flat, above 180 GeV it raises

\begin{tabular}{l c l} \(L\) & 5 \% & Measurement of luminosity \\ \hline \(\epsilon_{D}\) & 2 \% & Detector efficiency \\ \hline \(\epsilon_{L}\) & 2 \% & Lepton reconstruction efficiency \\ \hline \(\epsilon_{\gamma}\) & 2 \% & Photon reconstruction efficiency \\ \hline \(\epsilon_{b}\) & 3 \% & \(b\)-tagging efficiency \\ \hline \(\epsilon_{\tau}\) & 3 \% & \(\tau\)-tagging efficiency (hadronic decay) \\ \hline \(\epsilon_{\rm Tag}\) & 5 \% & WBF tag-jets / jet-veto efficiency \\ \hline \(\epsilon_{\rm Iso}\) & 3 \% & Lepton isolation efficiency (\(H\to ZZ\to 4l\)) \\ \end{tabular}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:7]

of an upper limit on the uncertainty that should be reachable by combining total cross section measurements with theoretical calculations of the cross section in the relevant regions of phase space. Due to the large errors, the results of the fits are only slightly improved.
4. QCD/PDF and QED uncertainties for signal processes: Depending on the type of coupling parameters one is extracting from the Higgs boson channels, additional theoretical uncertainties can occur. One example is the measurement of the couplings \(g\) obtained from the signal cross sections. Higgs boson signal cross sections are all proportional to the square of a given Higgs boson coupling, but the proportionality constants are not absolutely known from theory. This kind of uncertainty is described in the relevant section.

\end{table}
Table 3: Estimates for the uncertainty in determining the total number of background events from studies in signal free normalisation regions. \(\Delta\alpha_{B}\) is the systematic uncertainty on the extrapolation of the measured rate in a normalisation region into the signal region, \(f_{B}\) is an estimate of the factor between the rate in the normalisation region and the background rate in the signal region. This gives an estimate of the number of events in the normalisation region.

## 4 Overview of studies used for the fits

In this section a short summary of all experimental studies, that were used for this analysis, is given. For each study the signal and the background processes are listed, and the specific form of equation (8) is given. The systematic effects considered for each study can be read from this equation. In appendix A the numbers of events for low and high luminosity are summarised. The Gluon Fusion production mode is abbreviated as GF, the Weak Boson Fusion production mode as WBF.

All studies for the WBF channels depend on the forward jet reconstruction. Since the forward jet reconstruction efficiency was studied only for low luminosity, it is not possible to give high luminosity results for the WBF channels. In the high luminosity fits the WBF channels enter only at low luminosity.

It should be noted that in the GF and WBF channels both production modes contribute simultaneously. To measure couplings from Higgs boson production, it is necessary to separate the two contributions. In the exclusive WBF studies the GF production mode is suppressed by a factor of 5 to 20 with respect to the WBF production (due to the cuts on tagging jets and the cental jet veto).

By applying a cut on the reconstructed \(p_{T}\) of the Higgs boson in the inclusive studies for \(H\to ZZ\) and \(H\to WW\), the WBF signal can be suppressed by a factor of 5 to 40 with respect to the GF signal.

Provided the Monte Carlo simulations for the WBF and the GF signals are sufficiently accurate by the time an analysis like this one is done with real data, this suppression of one signal type with respect to the other should allow to distinguish between the two. No systematic error on the separation of the two signal types is used.

Maximum Likelihood fit

Depending on the theoretical assumptions one is willing to make for the fits, different kinds of coupling parameters can be extracted.

One should notice that already for the studies of \(H\to WW\) a CP-even, spin-0 Higgs boson is assumed (in the lepton-lepton angular correlation), so all fits are based on this assumption. In [5, 9] it is shown to what extent this can be tested independently using \(H\to ZZ\) decays.

For this analysis the following cases of progressive theoretical assumptions are considered:

1. No additional assumptions beyond CP-even, spin-0: There can be more than one Higgs boson (degenerate in mass), only a measurement of rates is possible.
2. Only one Higgs boson: Measurement of relative branching ratios \(\frac{\mathrm{BR}(H\to XX)}{\mathrm{BR}(H\to WW)}\); equivalent to a measurement of ratios of the Higgs boson partial width \(\frac{\Gamma_{X}}{\Gamma_{W}}\).
3. Only the dominant couplings of the standard model are present (no extra particles or extremely strong couplings to light fermions): Measurement of ratios of Higgs boson couplings \(\frac{g_{X}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\).
4. Same assumptions: A lower limit on the total width is given by the sum of the visible decay modes.
5. The sum of all visible branching ratios is of the same size as in the standard model: Measurement of absolute couplings and total width.

For all fits a detailed table of all errors is given in appendix B.

### Measurement of rates

The most general case considered here is the direct measurement of rates. This can be done without assumptions on the number of Higgs Bosons or their properties. Only signal channels using the same production and decay mode of the Higgs boson (but having a different final state) may be combined (e.g. WBF \(H\to\tau\tau\) fully leptonic and semi leptonic \(\tau\)-decays). As mentioned above, the results for all studies using the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\) decay mode of the Higgs Boson are valid only under the assumption of a CP-even, spin-0 Higgs Boson. In Table 5 the fit parameters \(\vec{x}\) for the rates along with the mass range, where the parameters can be fitted, are shown.

Since the rates in the individual channels are quite small the errors for most channels are large. Shown in Figure 1 and 2 are the relative errors on the measurements of rates that can be expected after 3 years of running at low luminosity (30 fb\({}^{-1}\)) and at high luminosity (300 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

The errors determined from the fit are in general asymmetric, the relative error \(\frac{\Delta x}{x}\) shown in the figures, is defined as:

\[\frac{\Delta x}{x}:=\frac{1}{x}\sqrt{\frac{(\Delta^{+}x)^{2}+(\Delta^{-}x)^{2} }{2}}\quad. \tag{13}\]

Overall, one observes that the decays \(H\to WW\) can be measured with the best accuracy. Above 160 GeV the Higgs boson can decay into two on-shell \(W\) bosons, suppressing all other Higgs boson decays. As a consequence the decays \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to\tau\tau\) and \(H\to b\bar{b}\) are visible only for \(m_{H}<160\) GeV and the error in the measurement of the rate for the \(H\to ZZ\) channels is doubled for 160 GeV \(\leq m_{H}\leq\) 180 GeV. At \(m_{H}=\)180 GeV two on-shell \(Z\) bosons can be produced, reducing the error on the measurement of \(H\to ZZ\) again. This general behaviour is visible in all fits.

### Measurement of relative branching ratios

Measurements with errors smaller than the errors on the rates can be obtained by reducing the number of parameters to be fitted. However, without additional assumptions, this is not possible.

The simplest assumption one can make is to assume the presence of only one Higgs boson. Any additional Higgs bosons, if they exist, have to be clearly

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|l} \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{j}\) & Higgs boson mass \\ \hline \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{gg\to H(H\to ZZ)}\) & 110 GeV - 200 GeV \\ \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{qq\,H(H\to ZZ)}\) & 110 GeV - 200 GeV \\ \hline \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{gg\to H(H\to WW)}\) & 110 GeV - 200 GeV \\ \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{qq\,H(H\to WW)}\) & 110 GeV - 190 GeV \\ \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{W\,H(H\to WW)}\) & 150 GeV - 190 GeV \\ \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{t\bar{t}\,H(H\to WW)}\) & 120 GeV - 200 GeV \\ \hline \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{gg\to H(H\to\gamma\gamma)}\) & 110 GeV - 150 GeV \\ \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{t\bar{t}\,H(H\to\gamma\gamma)}\) & 110 GeV - 120 GeV \\ \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{W\,H(H\to\gamma\gamma)}\) & 110 GeV - 120 GeV \\ \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{Z\,H(H\to\gamma\gamma)}\) & 110 GeV - 120 GeV \\ \hline \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{qq\,H(H\to\tau\tau)}\) & 110 GeV - 150 GeV \\ \hline \((\sigma\cdot\text{BR})_{t\bar{t}\,H(H\to b\bar{b})}\) & 110 GeV - 140 GeV \\ \end{tabular}

separated in mass and may not contribute to the channels considered here. Using this assumption, relative branching ratios can be determined.

Two different kinds of coupling parameters are fitted. On the one hand the product \(\sigma_{j}\cdot\mathrm{BR(H\to WW)}\) for the production of a Higgs boson with decays into \(WW\) is chosen. On the other hand the Higgs boson branching ratios relative to the branching ratio \(\mathrm{BR(H\to WW)}\). This ratio of branching ratios is identical to the ratio of the corresponding Higgs boson partial widths. The parameters of the fit are summarised in Table 6.

The decay \(H\to WW\) is used as a normalisation since, for most production modes and for Higgs boson masses above 120 GeV, it is the final state which can be measured with the smallest error (see section 5.1).

The total width of a Higgs boson cannot be measured directly in the considered mass range (see Figure 3). Due to this restriction it is not possible to distinguish between Higgs boson production and decay in the product \(\sigma\cdot\mathrm{BR}\), so only relative measurements of branching ratios are possible.

In Figure 4 the expected relative error on the measurement of ratios of Higgs boson branching ratios is shown for low and high luminosity. The dashed line gives the relative error that could be expected without systematic uncertainties.

At low luminosity the error on the relative branching ratio \(\frac{\mathrm{BR(}H\to b\bar{b})}{\mathrm{BR(}H\to WW)}\) is more than 140% and not shown in Figure 4. The measurement of this ratio depends entirely on the channel \(t\bar{t}\,H(H\to b\bar{b})\), which has a very low signal to background ratio. The total error is dominated by the systematic uncertainty on the background.

All other relative branching ratios can be measured with an accuracy better than 60% (for \(m_{H}\geq\) 120 GeV).

For a Higgs mass below 120 GeV a normalisation to the decay \(\mathrm{BR(}H\to\gamma\gamma)\) would be more appropriate, because the rates in all \(H\to WW\) channels are very low. Since this range of mass is nearly ruled out by LEP, it was not treated separately here.

### Measurement of relative couplings

For the fits in the previous section the coupling information contained in the Higgs boson production vertex was not used. By assuming that only the known particles of the standard model couple to the Higgs boson and that there are no extremely enhanced couplings to light fermions, one can express all Higgs boson production and decay modes by the Higgs boson couplings \(g_{W}\), \(g_{Z}\), \(g_{t}\), \(g_{b}\) and \(g_{\tau}\).

As described in the previous section, the total width of the Higgs boson can not be measured. So only ratios of Higgs boson couplings can be determined. Since all physical processes are related to the square of the coupling strength, ratios of coupling squares are used (see Table 7). In addition, there has to be a scale for all processes which combines the coupling \(g_{W}\) and the total width \(\Gamma_{H}\). It is chosen to be \(\frac{g_{W}^{2}}{\sqrt{\Gamma_{H}}}\).

All Higgs boson production cross sections can be expressed by the couplings in the following way:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}\sigma_{ggH}&=&\alpha_{ggH}\cdot g_{t}^{2}\\ \sigma_{\rm WBF}&=&\alpha_{\rm WF}\cdot g_{W}^{2}\,+\,\alpha_{\rm ZF}\cdot g _{Z}^{2}\\ \sigma_{t\bar{t}H}&=&\alpha_{t\bar{t}H}\cdot g_{t}^{2}\\ \sigma_{WH}&=&\alpha_{WH}\cdot g_{W}^{2}\\ \sigma_{ZH}&=&\alpha_{ZH}\cdot g_{Z}^{2}\quad.\end{array} \tag{14}\]

The GF production mode is not strictly proportional to the top-coupling squared but has additional contributions from the interference of a \(b\)-loop (in the standard model between 7 % at 110 GeV and 4 % at 190 GeV [31]) and from \(b\bar{b}\to H\). For the moment, these additional contributions are ignored, so it is assumed that the \(b\)-coupling is not extremely enhanced (by a factor of 10 or more compared to the standard model). A more detailed discussion follows at the end of this section.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c} coupling parameter & Higgs boson mass \\ \hline coupling ratio & \(\frac{g_{Z}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\) & 110 GeV - 190 GeV \\ coupling ratio & \(\frac{g_{Z}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\) & 110 GeV - 150 GeV \\ coupling ratio & \(\frac{g_{b}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\) & 110 GeV - 140 GeV \\ coupling ratio & \(\frac{g_{t}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\) & 110 GeV - 190 GeV \\ scale & \(\frac{g_{W}^{2}}{\sqrt{\Gamma_{H}}}\) & 110 GeV - 190 GeV \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: Overview of the Higgs boson coupling parameters \(\vec{x}\) in the fit of relative couplings.

For WBF the interference effect between \(W\)- and \(Z\)-Fusion is very small (\(<1\) %) and can be ignored safely [32].

The coefficients \(\alpha\) are the proportionality constants between the couplings squared and the cross-sections and have to be calculated from theory. Since these calculations are not possible with infinite precision, the constants \(\alpha\) are treated with a systematic uncertainty (see Table 8).

Similarly, all Higgs boson branching ratios can be expressed in terms of the couplings and the total width:

\[\mbox{BR}(H\to WW) = \beta_{W}\frac{g_{W}^{2}}{\Gamma_{H}}\] \[\mbox{BR}(H\to ZZ) = \beta_{Z}\frac{g_{Z}^{2}}{\Gamma_{H}}\] \[\mbox{BR}(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma) = \frac{\left(\beta_{\gamma(W)}\cdot g_{W}-\beta_{\gamma(t)}\cdot g _{t}\right)^{2}}{\Gamma_{H}}\] \[\mbox{BR}(H\rightarrow\tau\tau) = \beta_{\tau}\frac{g_{\tau}^{2}}{\Gamma_{H}}\] \[\mbox{BR}(H\to b\bar{b}) = \beta_{b}\frac{g_{b}^{2}}{\Gamma_{H}}\qquad.\]

The decay \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) proceeds either by a \(W\)- or a \(t\)-loop, with destructive interference between both loops (\(\beta_{\gamma(W)}\), \(\beta_{\gamma(t)}>0\)). The relative contributions of the loops are taken from [22].

The coefficients \(\beta\) relate the coupling strength to the appropriate Higgs boson partial width. Since these coefficients can be calculated with high precision, systematic errors of 1 % on \(\beta\) are assumed (see Table 8). Uncertainties on the fermion masses (\(m_{b}\) and \(m_{t}\)) are not included in the uncertainties of \(\beta\). The uncertainties on \(m_{b}\) and \(m_{t}\) are only important when calculating \(g_{b}\) and \(g_{t}\) from the standard model theory and not when \(g_{b}\) and \(g_{t}\) are measured.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c|l c} \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Production} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Decay} \\ \hline \(\alpha_{ggH}\) & 20\% & \(\beta_{W}\) & 1\% \\ \(\alpha_{\rm WF}\) & 4\% & \(\beta_{Z}\) & 1\% \\ \(\alpha_{\rm ZF}\) & 4\% & \(\beta_{\gamma(W)}\) & 1\% \\ \(\alpha_{t\bar{t}H}\) & 15\% & \(\beta_{\gamma(t)}\) & 1\% \\ \(\alpha_{WH}\) & 7\% & \(\beta_{\tau}\) & 1\% \\ \(\alpha_{ZH}\) & 7\% & \(\beta_{b}\) & 1\% \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 8: Overview of the systematic uncertainties related to the fit of relative couplings [29, 1, 4, 12, 17, 18, 19, 30, 31]. The uncertainties on \(W\)- and \(Z\)-Fusion (\(\alpha_{\rm WF}\) and \(\alpha_{\rm ZF}\)) are treated as 100% correlated.

As an example, for the channel \(WH(H\to WW)\) the product \(\left(\sigma\cdot\mbox{BR}\right)_{j}\left(\vec{x}\right)\) in equation (8) can be written as:

\[\left(\sigma\cdot\mbox{BR}\right)_{WH(H\to WW)}\left(\vec{x}\right) = \sigma_{WH}\cdot\mbox{BR}(H\to WW) \tag{15}\] \[= \alpha_{WH}\cdot\frac{g_{W}^{2}}{\sqrt{\Gamma_{H}}}\cdot\beta_{W }\cdot\frac{g_{W}^{2}}{\sqrt{\Gamma_{H}}}\quad.\]

For the case of GF \(H\to ZZ\) it is:

\[\left(\sigma\cdot\mbox{BR}\right)_{ggH(H\to ZZ)}\left(\vec{x}\right) = \sigma_{ggH}\cdot\mbox{BR}(H\to ZZ) \tag{16}\] \[= \alpha_{ggH}\cdot\frac{g_{t}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\cdot\frac{g_{W}^{2} }{\sqrt{\Gamma_{H}}}\cdot\beta_{W}\cdot\frac{g_{Z}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\cdot\frac{ g_{W}^{2}}{\sqrt{\Gamma_{H}}}\quad.\]

In Figure 5 the relative error on the measurement of relative couplings is shown for low and high luminosity. Due to the high rates of the GF and \(t\bar{t}H\) production processes the top-coupling ratio \(g_{t}^{2}/g_{W}^{2}\) can be measured quite accurately already at low luminosity.

The reason for the small bump in \(g_{t}^{2}/g_{W}^{2}\) at \(m_{H}=170\) GeV is, that the top coupling is mainly measured from the production ratios of GF and \(t\bar{t}H\) to WBF.

Figure 5: Relative error for the measurement of relative couplings. The dashed lines give the expected relative error without systematic uncertainties.

To extract the \(W\)-coupling from WBF, the ratio \(g_{Z}^{2}/g_{W}^{2}\) has to be known (WBF is a combination of \(W\)- and \(Z\)-Fusion), but the precision on this ratio is reduced directly above the \(WW\) threshold (see end of section 5.1).

The small step that is visible at high luminosity for \(m_{H}\) = 130 GeV is due to the channel \(t\bar{t}H(H\to\gamma\gamma)\). This channel was studied only for \(m_{H}\leq 120\) GeV and allows in combination with all other \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channels a good measurement of the top-coupling ratio at high luminosity. The step would vanish, if the channel \(t\bar{t}H(H\to\gamma\gamma)\) was extended beyond \(m_{H}=120\) GeV.

As already mentioned the GF production mode has additional contributions from the interference of a \(b\)-loop and from \(b\bar{b}\to H\) (recently calculated in [25], neglected due to the small cross section).

For a Higgs boson mass below 150 GeV this is not really a problem, since a sufficiently accurate measurement of the \(b\)-coupling can be done in \(t\bar{t}H(H\to b\bar{b})\). For larger Higgs boson masses the chances of observing a \(b\bar{b}\) final state even with extremely enhanced \(b\)-coupling is very small due to the small branching ratio. It is not clear whether it is possible to measure an enhanced \(b\)-coupling from associated \(b\)-production modes, using one or two observed \(b\)-jets (the MSSM study for \(b\bar{b}H(H\to\tau\tau)\) additionally needs an enhanced \(\tau\)-coupling, so it can't be used here).

Figure 6: Relative error of \(\frac{g_{t}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\), if \(b\)-coupling effects are taken into account for the GF production. The black line corresponds to the result shown in Figure 5.

In essence this means that the \(b\)-coupling is undetermined except for its contribution to GF. In Figure 6 it is shown what happens to the measurement of the top-coupling ratio if no restriction on the \(b\)-coupling is applied and what is possible if the \(b\)-coupling ratio is restricted to be within a factor of 10 or 50 of the standard model value. The case of no restriction on the \(b\)-coupling is equivalent to using only \(t\bar{t}H(H\to WW)\) for the top-coupling measurement.

### Lower limit on the total width

Based on the fit of relative couplings in the last section one can extract a lower limit on the total width of the Higgs boson, which is basically given by the sum of all detectable Higgs boson decays. To do this, the scale \(\frac{g_{W}^{2}}{\sqrt{\Gamma_{H}}}\) in Table 7 is split into two parameters: \(g_{W}^{2}\) and \(\Gamma_{H}\).

In Figure 7 a) a plot of the likelihood function for \(\Gamma_{H}\) (\(m_{H}=\)140 GeV) is shown. Without an extra constraint the function has no upper bound except the upper limit on the total width of about 1 - 2 GeV that can be given from direct measurements of the width of the resonant peak in \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(H\to ZZ\).

Figure 7 b) shows the lower 1 \(\sigma\)-limit obtained from the observable Higgs decays and the upper limit from direct measurements together with the standard model expectation.

### Measurement of absolute couplings

The next step in extracting coupling information is to try to measure absolute couplings. This is impossible without some theoretical assumption that constrains the total width of the Higgs boson.

In the following it is assumed that the sum of all detectable Higgs boson branching ratios is identical to the same sum in the standard model with an error which corresponds to the sum of the undetected branching ratios in the standard model (see Figure 8).

\[\sum{\rm BR}(H\rightarrow{\rm detect.}) = \sum\;{\rm BR}(H\rightarrow{\rm detect.})_{\rm SM}\pm\epsilon_{ \rm SM}\quad, \tag{17}\]

where \(\epsilon_{\rm SM}\) is given by

\[\epsilon_{\rm SM} = 1-\sum\;{\rm BR}(H\rightarrow{\rm detect.})_{\rm SM}\quad. \tag{18}\]

The following branching ratios are considered as detectable:

* \({\rm BR}(H\to ZZ)\), \({\rm BR}(H\to WW)\) : 110 GeV \(\leq m_{H}\leq\) 190 GeV
* \({\rm BR}(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)\), \({\rm BR}(H\rightarrow\tau\tau)\), \({\rm BR}(H\to b\bar{b})\) : 110 GeV \(\leq m_{H}\leq\) 150 GeV

At \(m_{H}=\)150 GeV the \(b\bar{b}\) final state is hardly detectable (the measurement of the rate in \(t\bar{t}H(H\to b\bar{b})\) gives an error of about 300%). Nevertheless it

Figure 8: Sum of the visible/detectable Higgs boson branching ratios in the standard model (calculated with HDECAY [12]).

was treated as detectable since the standard model prediction at this mass is \(\text{BR}(H\to\ b\bar{b})\approx\ 0.17\) and neglecting it would lead to a large \(\epsilon_{\text{SM}}\).

The total width of the Higgs boson is fixed by assuming that the fraction of the non detectable Higgs boson decay modes is as small as in the standard model. The disadvantage of this is that the large error on the branching ratio in \(b\bar{b}\) (dominant for small Higgs boson masses) is propagated into the total width which then propagates to all other couplings.

In Figure 9 the relative error on this measurement of absolute couplings is shown for low and high luminosity.

Other choices of assumptions restricting the Higgs boson total width are possible and are investigated shortly.

## 6 Test of method - ATLAS expectation value

Up to now the fits used the final numbers of events quoted in the studies as input numbers. Within our current knowledge, these are the standard model

Figure 9: Relative error for the measurement of absolute couplings. The discontinuity at \(m_{H}\approx 150\) GeV originates from the change in the assumption for the sum of all branching ratios. For \(m_{H}\leq 150\) GeV the branching ratios into \(b\) and \(\tau\) are included, above 150 GeV they are not added to the sum.

expectation values (in leading order Monte Carlo calculation) for the observable numbers of events after all cuts. A real experiment would never give the standard model expectation in every channel, instead a statistical fluctuation of these numbers has to be expected. So the correct approach for the fits is to choose a large number of possible ATLAS experiment, calculate the precision on the coupling parameters and than average to get an expectation for the error.

A complication is that the expectation value of a given quantity (coupling parameter) is well defined, but not the expectation value for the error of this quantity. A good way of checking whether the errors obtained in the fits are consistent is to look at the distribution of the lower and upper 1 \(\sigma\)-limits for a large number of simulated ATLAS-experiments.

Since this approach is very time consuming, it is not possible to do this for every different type of measurement and every mass point. As an example this approach was used in the fit of relative couplings (section 5.3) for Higgs boson masses of 120 GeV (low event statistics) and 190 GeV (high event statistics).

For a Higgs boson mass of 120 GeV the distribution of the lower and upper 1 \(\sigma\)-limits are shown for the parameters \(\frac{g_{Z}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\), \(\frac{g_{T}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\), \(\frac{g_{b}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\) and \(\frac{g_{T}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\) after simulating 500 ATLAS experiments.

The x-axis of the plots is in units of the appropriate standard model value for some coupling parameter (so a value of 1 corresponds to the standard model expectation), the red lines indicate the results of the fits in section 5.3.

In Figures 14 and 15 the same distributions are shown for a Higgs boson mass of 190 GeV (using 158 simulated ATLAS experiments).

All distributions are nicely centered on the values determined in section 5.3, so it seems to be appropriate to directly use the expectation values for the number of events in the individual channels. For illustration a Gaussian is fitted to all distributions. Since Poisson probability functions are used to determine the number of events in every channel, the shape of the distributions can not be expected to be a Gaussian.

One should note that the width of these distributions is not the error on the measurement of a given coupling parameter. It is the expected spread in the measurement of the parameters if the standard model were actually true.

Since the errors given are at the 1 \(\sigma\)-level, there is a fraction of up to 30 % of all ATLAS experiments, where the true value 1 is not within the 1 \(\sigma\)-limits (depending on the amount of systematic uncertainties this fraction varies for the different coupling parameters).

Conclusion

One of the main goals of the ATLAS experiment is to find the Higgs boson. If this search is successful, it will be essential to measure the properties of the Higgs boson in order to find discrepancies to the theoretical predictions.

In this note the precision on the measurement of Higgs boson coupling parameters is determined. The ratios \(\frac{\Gamma_{Z}}{\Gamma_{W}}\), \(\frac{\Gamma_{\gamma}}{\Gamma_{W}}\) and \(\frac{\Gamma_{\tau}}{\Gamma_{W}}\) of the Higgs boson partial widths to \(Z\), \(\gamma\), \(\tau\) and \(W\) can be measured with a precision of 15% to 60% for \(m_{H}\geq 120\) GeV and a luminosity of L=30 fb\({}^{-1}\). Furthermore, assuming that only the known particles of the standard model couple to the Higgs boson, the coupling ratios \(\frac{g_{Z}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\), \(\frac{g_{\tau}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\) and \(\frac{g_{t}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\) can be measured with a precision of 15% to 50% (\(m_{H}\geq 125\) GeV, L=30 fb\({}^{-1}\)). With high luminosity (L=300 fb\({}^{-1}\)) a final accuracy of 30% on the top coupling ratio \(\frac{g_{t}^{2}}{g_{W}^{2}}\) can be expected. In addition, a lower limit on the total width of the Higgs boson can be determined using the sum of all visible decay widths.
