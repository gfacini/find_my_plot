###### Abstract

The impact of the alignment of the muon spectrometer on the search of the SM Higgs bosons decaying into four muons is studied. Misalignments of the muon spectrometer with different sizes and patterns are introduced at the level of the reconstruction program. The resulting changes in the SM Higgs boson reconstruction efficiency and mass measurement are given.

## 1 Introduction

The idea of a muon spectrometer with high momentum resolution for energetic muons is one of the main characteristics of the ATLAS experiment. The goal of the alignment system is to keep the contribution to the momentum resolution due to the alignment well below the term coming from the intrinsic resolution of the drift tubes for high Pt muons. This requirement implies tight specifications on the muon alignment system [1, 2].

The muon alignment system is based on a spider web of precisely positioned and calibrated optical devices (mainly RASNIK for the barrel and BCAM for the end-cap). The alignment concept is slightly different in the end-cap since it makes use of reference bars.

This note quantifies in a specific channel the benefits derived from the precise alignment of the muon spectrometer. The channel chosen in this note is the SM H \(\rightarrow\) ZZ \(\rightarrow\) 4\(\mu\). Three different values of M\({}_{\rm H}\) (200, 400 and 600 GeV) are considered. Although the precise EW measurements put an upper limit of \(\sim\)250 GeV (at 95% CL) on the SM Higgs boson mass, we considered interesting to test the muon spectrometer also on higher values of M\({}_{\rm H}\).

In the second section the procedure used to simulate misalignment of the muon spectrometer is described together with the MC samples used. In section three the impact of the misalignment on the muon momentum measurement is discussed both for single muons and for muons coming from Higgs decays. In section four the Higgs mass reconstruction is described followed by the results given in section five. Conclusions are derived in section six.

## 2 The misalignment procedure an the MC samples

In the standard ATLAS MonteCarlo chain (ATGEN, DICE, ATRECON) the alignment of the muon spectrometer is assumed to be perfect. In this note a misalignment is introduced at the reconstruction level (ATRECON). This is done by using a different database for the muon spectrometer in the reconstruction phase (ATRECON) with respect to the one used in the simulation of the detector (DICE). The different positions of the chambers in the two databases simulate the misalignment.

Two different procedures have been applied to misalign the chambers: in the first, referred to as _systematic_, all the middle stations in the barrel have been moved toward the end-caps and all the EM stations in the end-cap have been moved away form the Z axis; with this misalignment it is possible to shift in a coherent way all the sagittas of the muons of the same sign. In the second misalignment procedure, referred to as _random_, all the middle stations have been moved by a random amount with RMS equal to the misalignment size. The sizes of the misalignment are 30, 50, 100 and 200 \(\mu\)m.

Samples of single muons with Pt=1TeV have been used to check the impact of the misalignment on monochromatic high momentum muons. For each of the three values of M\({}_{\rm H}\), 1200 events have been generated with ATGEN and processed with DICE and ATRECON. Then the same events are passed trough ATRECON with the four different misaligned databases.

## 3 Impact of misalignment on the measured muon momentum

A first check of the impact of the misalignment on the measured momentum is done for muons. Single muon with Pt=1TeV are first considered. In the _systematic_ misalignment case we can group the muons in charge and in detector regions in such a way that the expected shift on the sagitta always goes in the direction of increasing (sample called _positive shift_) or of decreasing (sample called _negative shift_) the reconstructed momentum. In Tables 1 and 2 the effect of _systematic_ misalignment on single muons with Pt=1TeV is given.
