Introduction

The Cs calibration system, besides its principal role in the Tile Calorimeter cells intercalibration, is a valuable tool for studying the optical properties of the modules[1]. The differences between the signals that we get from each tile row, as well as the differences among cells or individual groups of tiles in a cell can be investigated. The Barrel Module0 instrumented in 1998 was equipped with different types of scintillating fibres, thus allowing a fair comparison of the types used. An exhaustive study of Cs calibration data from few scans gives information about the uniformity of light yielded to the PMTs. The behaviour of this data was compared to a model used to predict the optics response of the module. Other more detailed studies characterising the uniformity of response within a readout, cell or a part of it, is finally presented.

## 2 Model for light yield

The so called "Lisbon model" was used to predict the relative light yield from the tile and fibre system to the PMTs[2]. This model takes into account the variation in the amount of light that comes from the scintillating tiles to the fibres and the attenuation of this light when it is transported by the fibres. The scintillator light depends on the size of tiles and the attenuation in the fibres depends on their length and their optical characteristics. The input parameters to the model are the tile characteristics as measured for the Barrel Module0 98 tiles and the optics characteristics of the fibres used [3][4]. The exact situation of each type of fibre and their characteristics will be described in detail in the next section.

The predictions of this model were used to see if the dispersion and behaviour of the response inside a tile row or among tile rows was only due to the optics characteristics or to some additional factors.

## 3 Optics instrumentation of Barrel Module 98.

The Barrel Module0 instrumented in 1998 was equipped with two different types of fibres, referred in the following Bicron and Pol.Hi.Tech, from the names of the constructors. For each of them few groups with a variety of optics characteristics were used for the module (see Figure 1 for a detailed map). Pol.Hi.Tech. fibres were used on the positive \(\eta\) side and Bicron fibres were used on negative \(\eta\) side. Five parameters are needed to characterise each set of fibres as shown in (1) and in the two tables below. These parameters together with the length of the fibre (L) and the distance between the point where the light was collected and the point where it is yielded to the PMTs(x) are necessary to predict the light output to the PMTs.

\[F=I_{\mathit{Short}}\cdot\exp\left(-\frac{x}{\lambda_{\mathit{Short}}}\right) +I_{\mathit{Long}}\cdot\exp\left(-\frac{x}{\lambda_{\mathit{Long}}}\right)+R \cdot\left[I_{\mathit{Short}}\cdot\exp\left(-\frac{2L-x}{\lambda_{\mathit{Short }}}\right)+I_{\mathit{Long}}\cdot\exp\left(-\frac{2L-x}{\lambda_{\mathit{Long }}}\right)\right] \tag{1}\]

The Bicron fibres were characterised by the following values for their parameters (as measured in Lisbon):Figure 1 Schematic diagram of the position and characteristics of the fibres used in the Barrel Module0 98.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Short Attenuation Length & 23 cm \\ \hline Short I & 0.58 arbitrary units \\ \hline Long Attenuation Length & 345 cm \\ \hline Long I & 0.75 arbitrary units \\ \hline Reflectivity & 0.75 \\ \hline \end{tabular} Some of these fibres had an admixture of 60 ppm of UVA dopant, which could slightly affect their attenuation length, but there is no quantitative estimation available.

The Pol.Hi.Tech. were characterised by the following values for their parameters (as measured in Pisa):

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Short Attenuation Length & 30.3 cm \\ \hline Short I & 0.90 arbitrary units \\ \hline Long Attenuation Length & 290 cm \\ \hline Long I & 1.1 arbitrary units \\ \hline Reflectivity & 0.30, 0.37 or 0.47 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

There were three sets of fibres with different reflectivities. The one that had reflectivity equal to thirty per cent had less UVA dopant concentration (100 ppm in spite of 200 ppm). Therefore, their attenuation length is expected to be slightly larger but there is no quantitative estimation available here as well.

It is important to keep in mind that the parameter I for Bicron fibres is not directly comparable to the same parameter for Pol.Hi.Tech. fibres because the protocol of measurement in the two cases was not identical.

Some periods inside cells A-10, A-9, A+10, and A+9 had their fibres routed through grey profiles, whereas in the rest of the module black profiles were used.

All different attenuation lengths and reflectivities were taken into account in the model. Any possible effects due to different UVA dopant concentration or due to the use of grey profiles were not considered.

## 4 Cs data at nominal high-voltage.

One of the first steps in the gain setting1 of the Tile Calorimeter modules is to take Cs calibration data with the PMTs set to high voltage values corresponding to a nominal gain of \(10^{5}\) within a stated precision of 5%. These values are determined in PMT test benches at several institutes. Keeping in mind the uncertainty in the absolute definition of the PMT gains, this data only allows comparisons of the light yielded by each set of fibres. The dispersion of light output from the Cs data at nominal high voltage along tile rows gives also useful information.

Footnote 1: The procedure of defining the HV of each PMT such that the readout cells response is equalised.

The data analysed were from the runs 20059 and 20061. The raw data provided for every cell and tile row of the module were unfolded cell by cell, to account for the fact that when the source goes through each tile row 79.5% of the radiation generates light in that tile row and 20.5% in the next one2. Those values come directly from the data takenwith the Barrel Module0 98 and they show rms dispersions at the level of 0.4 %. Once the corrections had been done, the mean and its rms dispersion over all PMT signals for a given tile row and \(\eta\) side was calculated. These mean values and dispersions are normalised to the mean for tile row 4 of the Pol.Hi.Tech. side. The plot showing the dependence versus tile row is in Figure 2.

The data show higher response for the Bicron side than for the Pol.Hi.Tech. side in samplings two and three (corresponding to tile rows 4 to 11) but it is the other way around for sampling one (corresponding to tile rows 1 to 3). In sampling two and three the relative difference between the two fibre types is around 10 to 15 %. This was expected because the Bicron fibres had better reflectivity than the Pol.Hi.Tech. ones. In sampling one the Pol.Hi.Tech. fibres yield around 5 to 10 % more light than the Bicron fibres. On the negative \(\eta\) side the Bicron fibres in sampling one had 60 ppm UVA dopant concentration, which could reduce their light yield. The model does not include a prediction, which takes into account the different UVA dopant concentration such as to have an estimation of the UVA dopant effect. The observations exposed here are in agreement with the calculation of photoelectron yields from different tile rows using muon data at 90\({}^{\mathrm{o}}\)[5].

The dispersion of the Cs response at nominal high voltage is less than 15 % (Figure 2) within each tile row. This dispersion comes from the difference in optics properties, imperfections and uncertainty of the PMT gains along a tile row. The relative variation among tile rows is not bigger than 15%.

As mentioned in Section 3, the model predictions for the Bicron and Pol.Hi.Tech. fibres are not directly comparable, but each set of fibres can be separately compared to the model(Figure 3). These comparisons show a relative agreement between model and data at the level of 10 %, even though the model did not take into account all the optics parameters actually present.

Figure 2: The average response for a given tile row from runs 20059 and 20061 taken at nominal high voltage values (i.e. G=\(10^{5}\) for the PMTs), is plotted versus tile row. The error bars are actually the rms dispersions along the tile rows.

## 5 Cs data after cell equalisation

Once Cs data at nominal high voltage is taken, the next step towards the calibration of TileCal modules is the cell response equalisation. The data at nominal PMT gains from tile rows 2, 5, and 10 together with tables of PMT gain variation with HV, are used to equalise the Cs response of all cells of the module. The procedure is iterative until 1 % of dispersion is obtained.

After the equalisation, the data analysed were from runs 20241 and 20242. The raw data is again corrected by the sharing factor between tile rows as described in Section 4. The use of this type of data allows only comparisons within each sampling because the

Both in the case of Bicron (top) and Pol.Hi.Tech (bottom) sides the normalisation is done relative to row 4.

cell equalisation hides all optics differences among samplings. The equalised Cs data are plotted in Figure 4 against the model predictions for both types of fibres.

On both sides, tile row 11 shows a large disagreement between the data and the model predictions. Looking in detail, the typical form of Cs structures from tile row 11 (Figure 5) was very irregular. All reasons that could produce irregularities in the structure, such as bad couplings, fibres or tiles, tend to reduce the light yield to the PMT. Therefore, the response of cells from tile row 11 was recalculated using the highest plateau of the structure, as schematically indicated by the straight line of Figure 5. Having done this, Figure 6 shows a good agreement between data and the model predictions for tile row 11. Looking for explanations of the behaviour for the last tile row, the hypothesis remaining is a lower response of some of the biggest tiles used there. The same treatment was applied to tile row 3 of the Pol.Hi.Tech. side due to the numerous irregular structures.

Figure 4: Average response of cells in a tile row form equalised data vs tile row. The normalisation is done in each sampling for the calibration row, i.e. 2, 5, and 10. Data from runs 20241 and 20242 and predictions of the Lisbon model are used. The error bars are the rms dispersions along a tile row.

Another disagreement between data and the model appears in sampling one. The response from tile row 3 is around 5 % higher than expected (Figure 6). The fibres reading tile rows one and two of the first sampling can be expected to get less light than the rest because the profiles around them are cut. Tile row 2 was used for the cell equalisation. Therefore, the PMTs gain compensated for the light lost from tile row 2 and the data show higher response in the tile row 3 as compared to the model. The difference of 5 % agrees with measurements of light output of fibres with and without profiles around them [6].

Within each sampling, the response variations among tile rows are generally around 5%. This is expected by the differences in tile size and fibre lengths belonging to tile rows. The comparison per sampling of responses from the two sides of the module equipped with two types of fibres is shown in Figure 7, using Cs data after equalisation.

Except for the different types of fibres, the two \(\eta\) sides were identical in instrumentation. The responses in the three samplings were comparable between the two sides, except for tile rows 4 and 6, which are read by the same fibre. This effect is not expected and there is no clear explanation given.

Figure 6 Same as Figure 4 with data from tile rows 11 and 3 of Pol.Hi.Tech. side, corrected for their irregular structures. For tile row 3, only regular structures (40%) are used, whereas for tile row 11, the highest plateau is used as the response.

The individual cell response.

The individual cell response was investigated next, seeking more information about optics response.

In the Barrel Module0 of 98, different cells of a sampling were read by fibres of different length. The ratio of responses of tile row 7 over 4 and tile row 8 over 5 should depend only on fibre length. In this case it isn't strictly true because three samples of fibres with different reflectivities were used. The expected values for the ratios 8/5 and 7/4 from the model are plotted versus the difference between the length of fibres that read tile row 7 or 8 and the ones that read tile row 4 or 5. The difference can vary from 15 to 35 cm. Following the model, the dependence of the ratio 7/4 and 8/5 on that difference should be on a first approximation linear, as shown in figure 8, with a maximum expected difference of 5%. Reflectivities of fibres that read tile row 7 or 8 and tile row 4 or 5 also play an important role in the value of these ratios. Due to the above, in the case of the special optics map (Figure 1) of the Barrel Module0 98, the two \(\eta\) sides of the module were not comparable. Specifically, the two highest points of the positive \(\eta\) side shown in Figure 8, are consequences of the different fibres configuration used in cell BC1. This cell was read by fibres with R=0.30 in both sub-samplings while tile rows 7,8 and 4,5 were read by fibres of R=0.37 and R=0.47 respectively in the other BC cells.

When the same distribution is plotted for the source data, a large dispersion appears (Figure 9). The data come from runs 20241 and 20242, taken after the gain setting, although the use of these ratios cancels the PMT gain dependence. On the negative \(\eta\) side, although ratios appear to vary within 20%, their dependence on fibre length difference follows the trend expected from the model. On the other side, ratios show no correlation with the fibre length difference. This disagreement points out that something at the level of tiles, fibres or routing is not homogeneous mainly on the positive \(\eta\) side.

Figure 8: Expected values for tile rows response ratios 8/5 and 7/4 for each BC cell as predicted by the model. Ratios are plotted versus the fibre length difference (in cm) between tile rows.

An effect due to the tiles can be eliminated comparing the response from the two PMTs reading two sides of the same cell. In most of the cells both sides were read by fibers of the same length except of a few cases with 10% difference in length. Therefore we could expect left to right differences of up to 4% from the model in some cells. Figure 10 shows the differences between responses from the left and the right PMT reading each cell for all non-calibration tile rows. Before subtraction, the values had been normalised to the signal from the corresponding calibration tile row in order to remove residual effects due to PMT gain variations. The data show differences between left and right of up to 10%, which cannot be accounted for by fibre length differences.

Figure 10 Signal read by the left PMT minus signal read by the right PMT for all non-calibration tile rows. Each point corresponds to a group of tiles in a cell. Signals are normalised to their corresponding calibration tile row.

Figure 9: Ratios 8/5 and 7/4 from Cs source runs 20241 and 20242 are plotted versus fibre length difference (in cm) between tile rows.

The left-right differences observed are larger than expected and this could be due to tile to fibre couplings or routing, elements that are not taken into account in the model, or to defects of the fibres themselves. However, they are not systematic and are not large enough to explain the variation of ratios shown in Figure 9.

To further investigate if the effect has something to do with bundles and/or sub-bundles, the same left-right dependence was studied taking into account if tiles were connected to the same fibre or not, having again normalised to the response of the calibration tile row. The correlation between left-right response differences between tile rows read by the same fibres (Figure 11) and by different fibres (Figure 12) is shown.

The figures above indicate that the dispersion in individual cell responses (see Figure 9) is not dominated by bundle and sub-bundle effects. This is demonstrated by the fact that the left-right difference correlation is of the same width for pairs of tiles read by same fibre belonging to the same sub-bundle or read by different fibres belonging to different sub-bundles.

## 7 Individual tile response

Fluctuations in the individual tiles response as seen from the Cs scans (see the peaks in Figure 13) can be due to fluctuations in the scintillation of tiles, to individual fibres, to tile to fibre couplings or a combination of them. The actual spectrum of each tile row in a cell as seen by a Cs scan was used to extract the individual tiles response belonging to it. A symmetric exponential form has been chosen to fit the variation of individual (tile + fibre) signals versus the distance of the source from the z-axis (running parallel to the source direction) centre of the tile. The attenuation length of this exponential and the tile to tile distance in source path coordinate units, were kept constant within a cell3. The maximal signal was determined by the fitted values of individual peaks and is referred to as the individual tile response. The fitting program often failed when tried to fit a very irregular structure like many in tile row 11 of the Barrel Module0 98 (example in Figure 5). Therefore, the very irregular structures are not included in the results that follow.4

Footnote 4: The number of structures used were about half of the total available from all the cells and their tile rows.

Each group of tiles (tiles belonging to the same row in a cell) is then characterised by the dispersion of responses of individual peaks, thus giving a measure of the quality of the cell and the group. Two rather different types of structures were present in the data, i.e. with all their peaks visible or with some peaks lost as shown in Figure 13 and Figure 14 respectively.

Using only structures with peaks from all their tiles present, we have found the characteristic dispersion of individual tiles response inside one cell to be 5% as shown in Figure 15 (the rms dispersion has been divided by the mean response of all cells). On the other hand, the distribution of dispersions of individual tiles response for structures with some non-visible peak(s) is flatter and wider as shown in Figure 16. The rms dispersion can even reach 30%. A check has been made as to whether the cells with large peaks dispersion appear with a position preference in the module, thus indicating some zones where care has to be taken during the instrumentation. It has already been pointed out that tile rows 11, 10 and 3 of the positive eta side showed particularly irregular structures and their majority is not included in the peak fitting. Among the cells examined here no other geometric dependence was observed.

The individual tile response, apart from the quality of cells, can give information on the quality of couplings in the following way. Each individual peak response inside a group of tiles was normalised to the mean peak response inside that group in order to cancel its dependence on tile size, PMT gain or fibre length. Therefore the rms of all these normalised peaks was an estimation of tile to fibre coupling quality. Inhomogeneity of tiles in a group and/or of their readout fibres could also contribute to this dispersion. The sigma of normalised peak responses is 6.5% (Figure 17), which would imply a 2% dispersion for a cell of around 20 tiles. There seemed to be no geometric dependence for cells with larger normalised peak dispersion. Therefore, tile-to-fibre couplings would not be an important factor to response fluctuations if a careful job were done. We should keep in mind that no irregular structures neither structures with lost peaks were included in this analysis because the aim was to give the magnitude for the typical behaviour. In fact, the Barrel Module0 98 had quite a few coupling problems that could show more significant cell response fluctuations.

## 8 Conclusions.

The analysis of the optics properties of the TileCal Barrel Module0 in its 98 configuration, as seen by the Cs calibration data, has demonstrated:

* The Bicron fibres used on the negative \(\eta\) side of samplings two and three yield more light than the Pol.Hi.Tech. fibres used on the positive \(\eta\) side. The Bicron fibres used on the negative \(\eta\) side of sampling one yield less light than the Pol.Hi.Tech. fibres.
* The uniformity of light yield from different tile rows was good at the level of 15 %. The dispersion among tile rows within each sampling was smaller than 5 % after the cell equalisation, which was done using tile rows 2, 5, and 10.
* The Cs calibration data at nominal high voltage agreed with the optical model [1] to better than 15 %. After the cell equalisation the agreement is better than 5 %.

Figure 17: Individual tile response as given by fitting the peaks of the Cs structures of each group of tiles in a cell and normalised to the mean response of this group of tiles.

* In tile rows 1 and 2 less light than expected is yielded. This is most probably due to the fact that the profiles are cut in this region, a feature that won't be kept there in the ATLAS production.
* Cells with problems in tile-to-fibre couplings were present, being more pronounced in tile row 11.
* Individual cell response variations showed a behaviour that could not be explained by the model expectations. They seem to come mainly from tile-to-fibre coupling problems.
