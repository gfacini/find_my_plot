This document gives an updated description of the TRT end-cap material weight and distribution and chamber geometry, which is included in the detector description of the ATLAS software release 13.0.0. Moreover it also gives the radiation and nuclear interaction lengths.

keywords: materials, geometry, radiation length, nuclear interaction length, end-cap.

## 1 Introduction

The purpose of this study was to complete (see [1] for a similar update for the barrel TRT) in several respects the outdated description of the end-cap TRT that was given in the TDR of 2002. Indeed, the end-caps have been built during the last years and several modifications have been implemented. This document presents the material distributions, the radiation length, the nuclear interaction length and the weight of the TRT end-caps. This note also provides a comparison between estimated and measured weights of one TRT end-cap in its SR1 configuration. All the values given in this note are for the end-cap C (except the geometry definition which is given for the end-cap A) and are expected to be identical for the second end-cap within the experimental uncertainties.

Several important construction details have changed and have been added since the start of the design and prototyping. Additional material has been appeared at the inner radius of the end-caps. In particular there are only two types of wheels in each TRT end-caps (12 8-plane wheels of type A and 8 8-plane wheels of type B), so there is no type C wheels anymore. There are therefore two types of changes proposed for the detector description: geometry (size and definition of the new volumes) and material (content of the volumes). This note describes the numbers that have been included into the simulation for the TRT end-cap in the release 13.0.0.

## 2 Geometry definition of an individual end-cap

Table 1 shows the different volumes delimited by their z coordinates (along the beam axis) and their radii \(\mathrm{R_{in}}\) and \(\mathrm{R_{out}}\). These dimensions have been chosen to match the engineering drawings and to provide the best description of the real detector (see also Fig. 1). In the spaces between the membranes and the stacks, there is material (G10 shims and heat exchangers) that has been included in the adjacent volumes for simplification. The space between \(\mathrm{R}=1067\) mm and \(\mathrm{R}=1075\) mm is needed for clearance. Moreover the z coordinates of the squirrel cage rings did not change since the previous detector description and the actual volume filled by the services has been reduced to simplify the implementation of other volumes in the simulation. All the dimensions given below have been determined with a precision of about 1 mm.

Since we will need to adjust the position of the strawplanes in the active region when the physics runs will start, we need to maintain clearances between sub systems (for instance for alignment). Therefore, the geometry dimensions that should be used for calculation are the following (Tab. 2):

Figure 1: Volume definition for the TRT end-cap A.

where volume 1 is the total volume calculated from the dimensions and volume 2 is taking into account the gaps that have been put in the simulation.

## 3 Weights

To get a precise estimation of the total weight of the end-cap, a long study has been done to collect the primary material for all the components of the detector. This included several discussions with the technicians and engineers who designed and built the detector. As often as possible, the actual weight of the components has been used. Otherwise it has been calculated or estimated, for instance using the technical drawings. The result of this study is available at [2]. The file contains several information about both barrel and end-caps and in each sheet, it successively presents the detailed weight of all the individual parts. The total weight obtained per end-cap is listed in table 3. This leads to a total weight of M = 1128.5 kg for one end-cap (The same weight is expected for the second end-cap). The total uncertainty on this weight is estimated to be about 10.0 kg. To obtain this value, the following errors have been assigned to each component of the end-cap:

1% in case the weight has been measured (8.4 kg contribution to the total uncertainty)

2% when the weight has been calculated, using the volumes and the densities (4.6 kg)

5% for estimates (2.9 kg contribution)

20% on the solder, the glue or the contributions that could not be measured (0.6 kg)

a) Material distribution

From the collection of materials [1], we also have calculated the contribution of the individual items in the radiation (X0i) and nuclear interaction (\(\lambda\)0i) lengths inside each volume V, using the formulas:

X0i (%) = M (g) * T (cm) / (V (cm\({}^{3}\)) * X0i (g/cm\({}^{2}\)))

and

\(\lambda\)0i (%) = M (g) * T (cm) / (V (cm\({}^{3}\)) * \(\lambda\)0i (g/cm\({}^{2}\)))

where M is the weight of the contribution and T the thickness of material considered at normal incidence. Since the volumes have different orientations we have calculated these lengths along the beam-axis (Z) or following normal incidence (R) as it is shown in Fig. 2 (longitudinal and vertical red arrows).

To get the total equivalent radiation (X0\({}_{\text{eq}}\)) and nuclear interaction (\(\lambda\)0\({}_{\text{eq}}\)) lengths for each volume, we calculate the sum of the individual contributions, using the formulas [3]:

\(\text{X}_{\text{0eq}}\)\({}^{-1}\)\(=\)\(\sum\)\(\text{w}_{\text{i}}\). \(\text{X}_{\text{0}\,\text{i}}\)\({}^{-1}\)

and

\(\text{\lambda}_{\text{0eq}}\)\({}^{-1}\)\(=\)\(\sum\)\(\text{w}_{\text{i}}\). \(\text{\lambda}_{\text{0}\,\text{i}}\)\({}^{-1}\)

Figure 2: Calculation of the radiation and nuclear interaction lengths.

where \(w_{i}\) is the weight fraction of the contributions. The results are listed in table 4.

The two most interesting numbers in terms of tracking performance are the equivalent radiation lengths of the inner volumes as a function of the radius. The estimate in this note is 4.48 % for stack A and 3.55 % for stack B.

b) Modelled description

Instead of putting all the different components of the volumes in the simulation of the detector, we will simplify the description by using up to three different materials, whose combination gives a mixture that has the correct M, X\({}_{0}\) and \(\lambda_{0}\). This calculation used the standard material PDG values [3]. To take into account the high number of real materials used in a volume, one sometimes needs to use materials that don't exist in the real detector (Helium or Beryllium for instance). All the percentages given below correspond to weight fractions of the mixture (these fractions are the inputs for the simulation and some details are available at [4]). We also indicate in the same table the modified density of the material, which will be used to appropriately fill each volume. The modelled description is detailed in table 5. And the last columns allow the reader to check that we perfectly reproduce the same X0, \(\lambda 0\) and densities as in table 4. Note that the mixtures used to describe the active regions are indications only and will not be used in the description of the active region in the simulation. Actually in these particular volumes, we describe all the different components individually (as described in the section 5). The end-ring and the squirrel cage are completely made of aluminium, so it can simply be simulated with this single material, but with a modified density to completely fill each volume.

a) Z position of the heat exchangers:

The Z position of the wheels has been determined from a few measurements done on the heat exchangers and using a starting point located at Z = 836.5 mm on the end-caps [5, 6]. The heat exchangers are located between R\({}_{\rm max}=977.5\) mm and R\({}_{\rm min}=927.5\) mm. See [7] to get a drawing of a heat exchanger of type A. In the table 7, one sees the actual measurements of the position of the heat exchangers for both end-caps (the Z values given in the table correspond to the middle of the heat exchanger). Then, the Z position of the strawplanes, the membranes and the wheels have been deduced from those measurements with a precision of about 1mm.

b) Material and densities used for the heat exchangers:

The weight of one heat exchanger is about 1411 g (measured): with 139 g of Stainless Steel and 1272 g of Aluminium. In the simulation, the heat exchangers have been modelled with 4 materials as listed in the table 4. In addition, one can find the weight fractions, the standard densities and the modified densities needed to fill the two different type of volume between the wheels A and B, to take into account different wall thicknesses of the pipes (in the A-wheels, the thickness used is 7.8 mm, so the volume filled is V\({}_{\rm A}=2334.05\) cm\({}^{3}\); and in the B-wheels, the thickness used is 7.4 mm, so the volume filled is V\({}_{\rm B}=2214.35\) cm\({}^{3}\)).

These foils have a thickness of 0.05 mm and are composed of Kapton and Copper, but the copper can be neglected. They are between R\({}_{\rm min}\) = 620 mm and R\({}_{\rm max}\) = 1065 mm. The density of the Kapton is 1.42 g/cm\({}^{3}\). So the weight of one Kapton foil is M = 167.25 g. Then for the 12 A-wheels (8 B-wheels), we have 12 foils (16 foils in B) and the total weight is 2007.03 g (2676.04 g).

6Important comment about all Z positions of the TRT and the SCT end-caps

During the installation of the TRT and the SCT end-caps in the ATLAS detector, the engineers and the technicians have measured a few Z positions and they have noticed that the detectors couldn't be positioned at the designed Z position (corresponding to a starting point at Z = 830 mm). So the important change to take into account is that all the Z positions mentioned in this note should be shifted by + 5 mm for both sides (A and C). For instance it also concerns the heat exchangers and the strawplanes Z positions quoted in section 5. In the simulation this shift will be treated as a global alignment constant, because it also needs to be taken into account for the SCT end-caps. The reason of this shift is due to some other services that are located between the barrel and the end-caps and that occupy a bigger volume than expected.

7Comparison with actual measurements of the end-caps TRT weight

- The weight of the end-cap C (on the ID trolley) has been measured with 3 sensors (26.09.06). Four such measurements have been done and the precision of each measurement is about \(\pm\) 1 % per sensor. The results of the four measurements are listed in the table 7 (with their quadratic errors).

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline Measurements & Sensor 1 (kg) & Sensor 2 (kg) & Sensor 3 (kg) & Total (kg) \(\pm\) \\  & & & & error (kg) \\ \hline Number 1 & 425.8 & 533.8 & 924.5 & \(1884.1\pm 11.5\) \\ \hline Number 2 & 426.8 & 529.8 & 921.5 & \(1878.1\pm 11.5\) \\ \hline Number 3 & 426.6 & 532.2 & 918.0 & \(1876.8\pm 11.4\) \\ \hline Number 4 & 427.7 & 526.0 & 921.0 & \(1874.8\pm 11.4\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Tab.7: Results of the four weight measurements of the end-cap C.

The average weight of these 4 measurements is therefore 1878.5 kg \(\pm\) 11.5 kg. The weight of the EC-C trolley is 727.4 \(\pm\) 3 kg thus the total weight of the end-cap with the services in its SR1 configuration is 1151.1 kg \(\pm\) 11.9 kg.

To get the total weight of the end-cap as it is in the ATLAS detector, one must also remove the weight of some additional parts (installed for cooling and electronic tests or weight measurements) and add the weight of some missing parts (not yet installed). This difference is about \(32.9\pm 0.5\) kg. Thus one obtains a total weight from the measurement of 1118.2 kg \(\pm\) 11.9 kg. This has to be compared with the total weight obtained from the estimation (as explained in the section 3 of this note) of 1128.5 kg \(\pm\) 10.0 kg. The difference is then below 1 %.

- The same measurement has been done on the second end-cap (A) on the 20.11.06. The total weight obtained for the whole structure is \(1872\pm 11.5\) kg. If we deduce the weight of the EC-A trolley which is \(719\pm 3\) kg, we get a total weight of the TRT EC-A with the additional items of \(1153.0\) kg \(\pm\) 11.9 kg. Thus the final weight that can be compared to the estimation and to the other end-cap measurement is \(1120.1\pm 11.9\) kg. The difference is still below 1%.

- So the updated end-caps TRT description is estimated to be accurate to better than 1 %.
