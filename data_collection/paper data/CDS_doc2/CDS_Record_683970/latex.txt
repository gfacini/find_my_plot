**Abstract**

We report on the basic design and construction of an automate for the wiring of long MDT tubes. Part of the not fully completed installation was used to assemble manually 700 BOL tubes of 5.7 m length and in a semi-automatic way 350 BML tubes of 4.7 m length. After this production the installation was completed and few tubes produced automatically. It takes about 2 to 3 minutes to assemble one tube, depending on their length. A cost estimation for this automate is included in this report.

**1. Introduction**

The ATLAS Muon Spectrometer comprises about 1000 MDT chambers (Monitored Drift Tubes) assembled of 320 000 individually produced drift tubes of lengths between 2 and 6 m. They are made of precise 30 m m diameter aluminium tubes with a wall thickness of 400 \(\upmu\)m and are arranged into multilayers of tubes, with two multilayers forming a muon chamber, see Fig. 1. In Fig. 2 an engineering drawing of a single long MDT tube is presented. The need for high precision in the determination of the muon trajectory leads to stringent requirements on the components and the assembly of each individual MDT tube. In view of the very large number of MDT tubes to be produced, costs of each component and of the tube assembly have to be kept as low as possible, without losing its functional quality.

At CERN we studied a possible production scheme with a high degree of automation. It is based on few assumptions:

* the wire is centred by precision wire locators with respect to the inner tube walls
* long MDT tubes have a wire locator in the middle of the tube
* the wire (50 \(\upmu\)m diameter of WRe, gold-plated) should be threaded automatically through wire locators and end-plugs. (A manual threading of the wire through holes of 60 to 100 \(\upmu\)m diameter appeared to us difficult in a series production.)

The above assumptions led to some specific design aspects of the wire locators and the end-plugs; they are:

* the wire locator is made of two symmetric halves which fix the wire in the correct position when clipped together.
* a minimum free bore of 2 mm diameter in the end-plug is required to allow for a mechanism to thread the wire through automatically.

Such a large bore in the end-plug can not guarantee a precise position of the wire with respect to the tube axis. It therefore implies another wire locator just in front of each end-plug to assure the correct wire position.

Based on the above mentioned design requirements, the CERN MDT Group started to develop a wire locator and a prototype wiring automate whereas the Frascati Group developed end-plugs compatible with this automate. Two types of end-plugs were developed, the signal end-plug which contains the HV decoupling capacitor for the signal outlet mounted in series with a 100 k\(\Omega\) resistor to ground, and the HV end-plug to bring the HV via an 1 M\(\Omega\) resistor onto the wire and to terminate the signal correctly to ground via a serial connection of a 390 \(\Omega\) resistor and a capacitor of 1 nF. Both end-plugs contain a central Cu tube of 2 mm inside diameter for the passage and fixation of the wire.

To keep the costs of the prototype wiring automate low, mainly pressurised pistons, available off the shelf, and some AC motors from old equipment were used to realise moving actions. The sequence of thedifferent automatic assembly steps was driven by a Programmable Logic Controller from TELEMECANIQUE available in the CERN group.

The intention at the beginning of the project was to develop and test the possible use of a wiring automate; no real tube production was foreseen. Later on, before finishing the tests on the prototype automate, about 700 MDT tubes of 5.7 m length (BOL tubes) were assembled manually using part of its installations, afterwards another 350 tubes of 4.7 m length (BML tubes) in a semi-automatic way. After these productions the prototype automate was finished and few tubes were produced with a high degree of automation.

In this note, we report on the basic design of the wiring automate and its components and on some experience gained during the production of the BOL and BML tubes. Reasons which guided the design of the wire locator adapted to this wiring automate are given. In a separate note "MDT wiring at CERN", test results of the produced tubes and details of the MDT components (Al-tube, wire, end-plugs and more information on the wire locators) are given. A note on the end-plugs and pressure crimpers is in preparation by the Frascati ATLAS group. A video tape of the MDT tube assembly with the wiring automate is available at CERN.

## 2 Basic design of the wiring automate

Figure 3 shows an partial view of the wiring automate with the crimp and threading part in the foreground. The automate is installed in a dust-reduced area with small over pressure. A schematic layout of the automate is depicted in Fig. 4, arranged in functional sections (a) to (e), and Fig. 5 shows some details of sections (c) and (d) in a perspective view.

The production chain to assemble MDT tubes can be broken down into a sequence of distinct steps. A production cycle ends with a preparational step 0 for the next cycle.

1. [label=Step 0:]
2. the wire is threaded in section (c) through the 2 mm Cu tube of the HV end-plug
3. a moving arm of section (c) pushes the HV end-plug onto the ends of two long rods in section (d) and the wire is crimped in the Cu tube
4. three wire locators are placed in position on the rods, one at the middle of the tube and one at each end in front of the end-plugs. They consist of two symmetric halves which are clipped together. They are kept in position by spring-loaded fingers, as indicated in Fig. 5, and as can be seen in more detail in Fig. 6 where the HV end-plug together with one wire locator is shown.

Now a new complete production cycle can start, initiating the following sequence of actions which are summarised in a pict * An empty cleaned and controlled precision tube is moved from the feeding ramp into the centre of section (b), Fig. 4
* The advancing mechanism (a) pushes this tube to the right through the threading section (c) and over the whole length of section (d). The tube is centred on its path over the HV end-plug and the three wire locators.
* Having reached its correct position, the tube is crimped under isostatic air pressure around the tube at the HV end-plug and the three wire locators.
* The advancing mechanism (a) clips around the crimped Cu tube of the HV end-plug and pulls the whole MDT tube with end-plug, wire locators and wire to the left into section (b). The wire loop in section (e) provides enough wire length to follow this rapid displacement; it contains in addition a set-up to clean the wire.
* Two new end-plugs, a signal and HV one, are placed into the threading mechanism. The wire which was pulled along with the tube is threaded through the 2 mm Cu tube of both end-plugs and cut midway between the two end-plugs.
* The signal end-plug is pushed by the threading support head into the free (right) MDT tube end in section (b) and crimped pneumatically.
* The wire is tensioned at the signal end-plug by a weight and crimped under the correct tension in the Cu tube. The free wire end outside the end-plugs is cut and the finished MDT tube is taken out.

During step 6 and 7 the preparation of the next production cycle (step 0 of above) has finished and the new cycle is ready to start. As a first test the ohmic wire resistance of the finished MDT tube is measured and registered, giving an immediate indication of a broken or slipped wire.

## 3 Details of the components used at the wiring automate

### CERN wire locators

#### 3.1.1 Design

The request for automation of the wire threading and of solidly fixing its position under all running and mounting conditions of the MDT tubes in the detector (e.g. gas pressure up to 3 bar, mounting with inclined or vertical wire direction, shocks during mounting) led to the following design requirements for the wire locators:

* it should be made of 2 pieces which can easily be attached to each other with an automate, e.g. by clipping.
* it should easily catch the wire before being clipped together, e.g. by V-shaped lips.
* it should have a high degree of symmetry to reduce the sensitivity to inaccuracies in its production, e.g. using identical pieces for the two halves of one wire locator leads to self centring and reduces costs.

* the positioning of the wire should be between flat surfaces, opposite to each other and lining up at the correct distance. This avoids kinks in the wire which could happen if shearing surfaces are used instead.
* it should allow its mechanical fixing in the MDT tubes, e.g. by crimping, to guarantee its position during the whole lifetime under all running and mounting conditions.

To this have to be added the general requirements:

* it should not have radially flat surfaces which could easily lead to the gradual formation of conducting paths and discharges in the direction of the high electric field. The CERN wire locator has therefore stiffening rips with surfaces orthogonal to the field lines intercepting possible discharges.
* it should guarantee its precision and functionality over the whole lifetime and its quality should not deteriorate under the radiation exhibited in the muon system (\(\leq\) 0.1 Gray/year).
* it should allow for gas circulation in the tube.

The above mentioned requirements led to the design of an injection moulded wire locator as it is depicted in Fig. 8a-c. It consists of two identical halves which are mounted in mirror symmetry with an additional 180\({}^{\circ}\) rotation orthogonal to the symmetry axis. Glass fibre reinforced materials with NORYL, VECTRA or PEEK as base material seemed to be adequate. The required high precision on the wire position (the wire should be known to \(\pm\) 10 \(\upmu\)m with respect to the centre of the MDT tube) represents stringent conditions for a correct mould. It needs in general several trials and iterative changes of the mould to reach this precision.

For the prototype production of the MDT tubes at CERN, injection moulded wire locators of glass fibre reinforced VECTRA were produced by WUST (Unterhaching, Germany). As expected, the demanded and specified mechanical precision was not reached for the first produced batch. Due to the tight schedule for the prototype production of the BOL and BML tubes a further iteration to improve on the precision was not possible and therefore postponed.

#### 3.1.2 Fixation of the wire locators

At the beginning of the work on the wiring automate, a fixation of the locators and end-plugs by rolling a triplet of bulged wheels around the Al tubes was foreseen. This increased slightly the outside diameter of the Al tube at the edges of the crimp thus spoiling the subsequent stacking of the tubes where the wire locator position is used to give the high precision of the tube spacing. It was therefore abandoned. It was replaced by pressure crimpers, developed by the Frascati Group. This method works with 200 bar of isostatic air pressure around the Al tube at the end-plugs and 140 bar at the locators. Under this pressure the locator was slightly deformed but due to its symmetry in a self centring way.

#### 3.1.3 Experience

During the prototype production of the BOL and BML tubes the following weak points in the design of the wire locators became apparent:

* a missing stopping edge near the rim at the faces where the two halves join. This would prevent the two halves from sliding relative to each other in the direction orthogonal to the wire.
* the size of the hole for the wire in the centre of the locator depends on the air pressure used to crimp the locator. This could be avoided by modifying slightly the design such that the V-shaped lips which define the centring hole, touch each other, except at the hole.
* together with the above mentioned mechanical inaccuracy in the first batch of wire locators, all these effects could easily be corrected for in a further iteration of the injection mould.

We consider the CERN wire locators as superior to the ones favoured by the PC-Committee at the end of October 1996 which at that time were made from a single disk with a 60 \(\upmu\)m hole for the wire threading and with flat radial surfaces which do not inhibit the gradual formation of conducting paths. Apart from the difficulties of the wire threading which is cumbersome and can only be done by hand, it has no self centring action, the inaccuracy of the 60 \(\upmu\)m hole will always enter directly in the error of the wire position.

### Positioning mechanism for wire locators and HV end-plug

The wire locator positioning mechanism assures the axial positioning of the three wire locators, as shown in Fig. 5 and 6. It consists of Teflon coated aluminium tubes of 6 mm outer diameter with spring-loaded retractable wings to support the wire locators in axial direction. Due to the large distance between the locators (up to 3 m), the upper and lower wings are asymmetric to compensate for the sag of the rods of maximum 15 mm, corresponding to half the MDT tube diameter. Without this angle compensation the wire locators will not slide softly inside the MDT tube owing to the very small clearance of only 35 \(\upmu\)m in the diameter. In this way the wings assure the correct vertical and axial positioning of the wire locators when the MDT tube is pued over it to the right, and its retraction mechanism allows to pull the MDT tube with the crimped locators to the left over the whole length of the rods.

The HV end-plug is positioned on a set of spring loaded pins at the left end of each rod; it is shown in Fig. 6 together with the nearby locator. This end-plug holds the wire fixed by crimping onto its Cu tube. The wire is kept between the two rods and slightly stressed by the weight of the wire looping circuit, which is at the far end of the rods, section (e) of Fig. 4.

### Pushing and centring of the tube onto HV end-plug and wire locators

The tube advancing system, section (a) of Fig. 4, allows to push an empty precision tube to the right or to pull it back, when it is equipped with end-plugs and wire locators. For this purpose it has at its right end a clipping device which hooks onto the crimped Cu tube of the HV end-plug. The advancing system consists of a long solid tube fixed to a rack which can be advanced forward and backward by a pinion driven by an AC motor. The length of the advancing system is given by the length of the MDT tube and the length of the threading station, section (c) of Fig. 4.

When the empty precision tube is pushed to the right over the HV end-plug and the three wire locators (Fig. 7 step 2), a perfect centring between the tube and these components has to be guaranteed. This guidance is assured by a set of four rollers arranged around the circumference of the tube at each of these components. The diameter of the rollers is chosen such that it centres tube and component together at the moment  the tube passes over it. Figure 9 shows its functioning. It is obvious that only well deburned precision tubes are acceptable due to the very small difference of only 35 \(\upmu\)m between the inner tube diameter and the diameter of the locator.

### End-plugs, wire threading mechanism and tensioning

Both end-plugs comprise an aluminium  ring which contains a Viton O-ring in a step-shaped groove to assure the gas tightness of the MDT tubes. The aluminium  ring provides a ground contact to the tubes. Details of the Frascati end-plugs, together with the pressure crimpers are given in a separate note.

To allow for an automatic threading of the wire through the end-plugs, a free clearance of 2 mm diameter was assumed as a necessary condition. This was not meant to anticipate the final solution to be adopted by the Muon Community for the wire fixation, e.g. crimping, soldering, gluing, blocking, etc., or any combination. To come to a start with the prototype production at CERN, a crimping solution was proposed for the time being, using readily available Cu tubes of 2 mm  inside and 3 mm  outside diameter for the wire fixation in the end-plugs.

Parts of the threading mechanism  are visible in Fig. 5 and 10, its function is identical for both end-plugs. Having pulled the precision tube into  the finishing section (b), as explained in step 4 of chapter 2, the automate is ready for threading the wire through the end-plugs. As a first step, each of the two end-plugs is placed by hand with the Cu tube pointing downwards onto a movable arm, positioned outside the line of passage of the tube, see Fig. 5. With the help of lever arms, the wire in the threading station is pushed in a second step vertically upwards giving thus free space which allows to move the two arms with the end-plugs beneath the wire. Now the two wire catcher tubes are lowered, centring on their way the wire in its \(\Lambda\)shaped lips and itself in the conical central opening of the end-plugs (Fig. 10a). Inside each wire catcher a \(\Lambda\)-shaped needle of 1.6 mm diameter, with the upper corners of the \(\Lambda\) rounded off and softly continued some distance along the needle, is lowered. It grasps the wire which is thereby bent around the needle end and pushes it through the Cu tube until the needles enter far enough in the wire pulling heads (Fig. 10b and 10c). This movement creates a wire loop along the needle.

Each wire pulling head consists of two tooth belts facing each other with the teeth and turning such that the teeth which grip into each other move downwards. At the moment when the needle is pulled back the free wire loop is squeezed between the tooth belts and moved further down. In the meantime the wire between the two end-plugs is cut and the lever arms which pushed the wire up assure that the pulling heads can pull enough wire length through the end-plugs until the free ends of the wire are out of the Cu tubes. Now the end-plugs are turned such that the Cu tubes are horizontally. The signal end-plug is pushed along the wire direction into the open end of the precision tube and fixed by pressure crimping, action 5 and 6 of Fig. 7. The wire is now taken up by a disk fixed on a swivel arm, as can be seen in Fig. 10d. It allows with the help of a weight, attached to the pulling head, to stretch the wire to the correct tension before crimping it in the Cu tube. Now the production cycle is terminated and the finished MDT tube can be taken out.

In the meantime, the HV end-plug is pushed along the wire direction onto the two long rods in section (d) of Fig. 5, the wire is crimped in the Cu tube, and the installation is ready for the next production cycle.

### 3.5 Crimping of end-plugs, wire locators and wire

#### 3.5.1 Crimping of end-plugs and locators

To keep the MDT tubes gas tight, Viton O-rings are used for sealing. For the production of the prototype BOL and BML tubes, the gas sealing was done by crimping the tube on the O-ring with an isostatic air pressure around it; the wire locators were crimped in the same way. For successful crimping at the solid end-plugs, an air pressure not below 190 bar had to be used; for safety reasons 200 bar were not exceeded at the crimp installation. As mentioned before the crimp pressure at the locators was precisely kept at 140 bar in order not to damage the more fragile locators, at lower pressure the tube indent was not sufficiently stable, at higher pressure the risk to damage the locator increased.

As source and buffer for the air pressure, a standard 50 litre/200 bar bottle for compressed air was used. Its outlet was with one line via a throttle valve directly connected to the pressure crimpers for the end-plugs, with another line via a pressure reducer to the crimpers for the locators. As soon as the pressure in the buffer bottle reached 190 bar it was refilled to 200 bar with a standard compressor (BAUER) for diving bottles. The compressor was on loan from the Frascati group for the production of the BOL and BML tubes.

Having finished the prototype MDT tube production, a pure mechanical crimping using four concentric jaws to indent the tube was tested. It gives a very precise tube indent without deforming the locators unnecessarily. No upward bump at the rim of the dent was observed. It would be our favoured crimp solution for end-plugs and wire locators for a future production.

#### 3.5.2 Wire crimping

The question of the wire fixing in the end-plugs was not addressed at the beginning of the work on the wiring automate, because no MDT production at CERN was foreseen and each of the MDT groups proposed its own fixing method. With the request to produce the BOL and BML prototype MDT tubes at CERN, a wire fixation by mechanical crimping the Cu tube was developed. First tests with crimping the wire in the naked Cu tube resulted often in a broken wire indicating an excessive deformation of the wire, and they gave no good gas seal. Flat and softly undulated crimp surfaces were tried, but best results were obtained by crimping the Cu tube into a C-shape over a length of about 8 mm. The crimping surfaces are made slightly conical in axial direction, with the opening angle towards the inside of the MDT tubes.

To reduce the deformation of the wire by the Cu tube and to assure a good flow of material all around the wire over the whole length of the crimp, a thin layer of Indium was deposited at the inside of the Cu tube. This improved also on the gas seal of the crimp, specially at the corners of the C-shape. Figure 11a shows a cross section through an early crimp. The thickness of the Indium layer, on the photo visible as a black line between the squeezed surfaces and in the corner of the C-shape, varies depending on the axial position of this cross-section on the conical crimp. The danger of gas leaks in the corners is clearly visible. This could be improved by better and more precise shaping of the crimping tools, f.i. by electro erosion, to squeeze these corners better. It was not done for the tools in this production. The apparent missing material or flattening of the crimp at its lower side, see Fig. 11a, is due to a champfer not visible on the photo because of the short image depth of the microscope.

Important is that the wire is fixed in the centre of the C-shape and not in the corners. Figure 11b gives a detailed view of the area around the wire. The use of Indium gave reasonably good results for the wire crimp but some development work is still needed.

To assure a safe wire fixation over the long lifetime of the ATLAS detector, it was foreseen from the beginning to double the fixation by a second method. Having finished a MDT tube in the automate and having tested it by measuring the ohmig wire resistance, we therefore filled the outer end of the crimped Cu tube with standard epoxy resin (Araldite) which polymerised over night before the MDT tubes were tested further.

## 4 Tube production time

A video film of a possible automatic production of a MDT tube is available at CERN. In this film, the production is broken down into separate steps each one initiated by manual action of a switch to allow for a safe control of the correct functioning. For the time being the mounting of the wire locators onto the Al rods was not automated. Eliminating the switches by an automatic cycle shows that, depending on the length of the tubes, a production time of 2 to 3 minutes per MDT tube can be reached. The only manual interaction necessary would be to place the end-plugs onto the movable arms in the threading station and to watch the proper functioning of the whole process.

## 5 Space requirements of the automate

The space requirement for the automate can be deduced from the scheme in Fig. 4. The concept of our installation is based on the following principles:

* to work with a horizontal arrangement for the production of the MDT tubes.
* to bring the wire automatically from one tube end to a well defined position at the other end.

These principles exclude the possibilities to lower the wire by gravity through the tube or, as another possibility, to blow it through. Furthermore it is easier for the production of long tubes to find enough floor space for a horizontal arrangement than building height in a vertical one. A horizontal arrangement is in addition less man power consuming and less tiring for the personnel.

For a MDT tube of length L the minimum length of the installation, cf. Fig. 4, is given by the length L of the tube finishing section (b), the length L of section (d) for the rods to position one end-plug with the wire and the locators, plus the threading section (c) of about 0.8 m and another 0.8 m for section (e) which comprises the wire cleaning, the wire loop and spool. To this has to be added the space for the tube advancing mechanism, section (a) of Fig. 4, which had in our installation for simplicity the length L extended by 0.8 m for the threading section. This gives a total axial length of the installation of about 3 \(\cdot\) (L + 0.8 m). This length could be made shorter if a more sophisticated advancing mechanism is chosen.

Apart from the threading section, which is 0.8 m wide, the installation is mounted onto two U-profiles, facing each other; this gives a lateral width of about 0.2 m. The U-profiles allow to adjust the installation to different tube lengths. The ramps for the tube feeding and to store momentarily few finished tubes extend section (b) laterally also to 0.8 m. Further lateral space has to be foreseen for pneumatic installation, to bring in boxes with empty tubes and to store temporarily the daily production of finished MDTs on a hand-cart. The whole installation was thus housed in a dust reduced tent of 4 m width were filtered air blown in produced a slight over pressure to keep dust out.

## 6 Cost estimation of the automate

The following gives an estimation of the material and machining costs of the automate. It is broken down into some functional groups to allow partial estimates. As mentioned in the introduction, a Programmable Logic Controller, available in the group, was used to drive the sequence of the automatic assembly steps. If wanted appropriate other programmable equipment could be used instead. For this prototype set-up, for which no production was foreseen, no special controls and interlocks were installed to inhibit the production in case of malfunctioning; it has to be added in a real production centre.
