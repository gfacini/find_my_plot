**Proposal for Luminosity Measurement at LHC**

The luminosity measurement of pp collisions at LHC utilizing the forward production of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs in the two-photon process \(pp\to ppe^{+}e^{-}\) is proposed. The possible experimental setup as well as the relevant background sources are shortly discussed. The expected precision of the measurement is l-3%.

## Appendix A Introduction

Luminosity measurement at pp colliders using the elastic two-photon production of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs (see Fig. 1a) was proposed in 1973 in the context of the ISR [1]. The authors of the proposal stressed that the cross-section for this process could be accurately computed using QEDonly. This idea should work much better in the case of the LHC as, for example, a high-energy approximation used in the calculations is more appropriate and the energy of produced electrons and positrons is larger and easier to measure.

The method of luminosity measurement at LHC presented in this note is based on the measurement of forward-produced electrons and positrons (emission angles smaller than \(\approx\)0.8 mrad) in the energy range of approximately 5-20 GeV or above 200 GeV; when the final-state protons escape undetected in the beam-pipe. The measurement requires two (or four in case of the measurement of the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair production along both proton beams) detectors measuring energy and position (and emission angles) of the produced electrons and positrons. It is preferable that such detectors are located after not too many beam-line elements, as this may seriously limit energy range of high acceptance and its understanding. As examples, two scenarios are considered using the description of the LHC low-beta insertions published in [2]:

1. The detectors are installed after a collimator protecting the so-called inner triplet (TDS in Fig. 14 in [2]). To deflect the produced electrons and positrons out of the beam pipe, a small analyzing dipole has to be installed in front of TDS.
2. The detectors are installed after the first separating dipole (D1 in Fig. 14 in [2]). Here the accessible positron/electron energies are much higher.

The second solution is probably preferable given the very limited space close to the interaction point (IP) and the lower flux of secondary particles from pp collisions, but it has also severe limitations. Only the very high-energy part of the \(e^{+}\), \(e^{-}\) spectrum can be measured (energies larger than about 200 GeV) where diffractive and inelastic backgrounds are higher, and the observable cross-section much smaller than in the first solution. The expected rates for the nominal luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) are about 4 kHz and below a few Hz (using formula (15) from [1]) for the first and second solutions respectively. The radiation exposure is much higher in the first proposal and may be prohibitive at the nominal luminosity.

Since in the second method the produced electrons and positrons have to traverse many beam-line elements, the acceptance is more difficult to handle than in the first one. Without appropriate simulation/description of the beam-line one could hardly make any further quantitative studies of this solution. Therefore, only the first solution has been studied in some detail.

In a recent note [3], luminosity measurement at LHC utilizing the same process was proposed. The method of [3] requires detection of the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs in the central rapidity region (\(|y|<0.85\)) at transverse momenta \(0.4<p_{t}<1\) GeV/c. The alternative method presented here ensures much higher event rate and it should be feasible also at the nominal LHC luminosity. It would require installation of the detectors in the very forward-region, but would offer a simple (both technically and conceptually) triggering scheme based on the measured energy and emission angle of the produced electrons and positrons. Additionally, such detectors could also produce valuable information on the rate of the forward-produced particles at LHC as well as fast on-line information on the background conditions.

## Appendix B Experimental Setup

An example of the experimental setup according to the first scenario is shown in Fig. 2. It consists of a small (permanent?) dipole magnet installed in front of TDS, a modified beam-pipe with two (electron/positron) exit windows on both sides, and two compact detectors measuring the energy and impact point of the electrons and positrons. The dipole should have about 0.35 Tm bending power which would result in a tiny deflection of the beams (\(\approx 15\)\(\mu\)rad) and in substantial bending of electrons/positrons in the 5-20 GeV range. A vacuum chamber inside TDS should have the variable aperture from the initial \(\emptyset\)=30 mm to

120\(\times\)40 mm about 3 m further downstream where the exit windows would be installed. The inner edge of the windows at about 20 mm from the beam axis defines the highest energy (20 GeV) of the accepted events and the outer edge the lowest energy of about 5 GeV. The detectors should have both very good energy (\(\approx\) 5%/\(\sqrt{E(GeV)}\)) and position resolution (about 0.3 mm) to allow tight selection cuts and good background suppression. Possible candidates are segmented \(PbWO_{4}\) crystal or sampling tungsten/scintillator calorimeters, with photomultiplier readout. For background control and rejection, some veto counters should be installed behind and in front of the calorimeters. The readout should be fast to avoid signal pile-up and to allow tight timing cuts.

## Appendix C Trigger

The elastically produced \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs have both very small transverse momenta as well as effective masses (typically a few \(m_{e}\)). At high energies, the production rate is proportional to \(1/(E_{+}+E_{-})^{3}\), where \(E_{+}\) and \(E_{-}\) are the positron and electron energies in the laboratory system, respectively. Pairs produced in two-photon inelastic or strong inelastic processes (see Fig. 1b,c) typically have much larger effective masses as well as transverse momenta, and in the latter case also have a different energy spectrum. Therefore, a possible trigger/selection for \(pp\to ppe^{+}e^{-}\) events could be sketched as follows:

1. Energy deposits in both detectors above some threshold value.
2. Fiducial cuts using the position measurement.
3. Measured energies in the 5-20 GeV range.
4. Small effective mass, \(M_{\mathit{eff}}\), and transverse momentum, \(p_{t}\), of the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair, for example \(M_{\mathit{eff}}<0.01\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\), p\({}_{t}<0.01\) GeV/c.

Figure 2: Sketch of the experimental setup for the first scenario; TDS is a shielding of the inner triplet, C1 and C2 are the calorimeters with position detection, S is an additional shielding. D is the small analyzing dipole and V1.4 are veto counters.

5. No veto from the counters (i.e. 1 m.i.p. signal in the front counters and no signal (\(\equiv\) no energy leakage) from the rear counters).
6. Good timing.

The first condition is a basic trigger coincidence requirement, the second one should ensure a precise energy measurement which is needed for the selection of the elastically produced pairs using the next three conditions. The last two conditions should reject accidental signals due to hadronic background from pp (see Fig. 1 d) or beam-gas collisions.

The expected rates at the nominal luminosity due to pp collisions are: less than 100 kHz (see Sec. D) at the first trigger level (condition 1. and 5.) and about 5 kHz after full event reconstruction and applying all remaining cuts. In principle, a trigger for the 'luminosity events' can be a stand-alone and local, i.e. not using information from the central detectors. However, for studying the inelastic background at low luminosity the coincidence with a trigger of'minimum-bias events' could be very useful (see below).

## Appendix D Background

The possible sources of background were studied extensively in [1]. The main contributions are due to inelastic \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair production (Fig. 1b,c) and misidentified hadronic events.

The inelastically-produced \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs in the two-photon process have a significantly wider distribution of the effective masses (\(d\sigma/dM_{\mathit{eff}}\sim 1/M_{\mathit{eff}}\)) compared to elastically produced \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs (\(d\sigma/dM_{\mathit{eff}}\sim 1/M_{\mathit{eff}}^{3}\)). Therefore, according to [1], after applying tight \(M_{\mathit{eff}}\) cuts (e.g. \(M_{\mathit{eff}}<0.01\)GeV/c\({}^{2}\)) the two-photon inelastic background should be small, below the 1% level.

The background due to the inelastically produced \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs in strong interactions was estimated using a formula (B2) from [1] convolved with the estimated acceptance of the luminosity detectors1. For the acceptance calculation, it was assumed that the \(p_{t}^{2}\) distribution of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs is proportional to \(\exp{(-\mathit{b}\sqrt{m_{\pi}^{2}+p_{t}^{2}})}\), where 2/b=500 MeV at LHC c.m. energy, according to fits from [5]. Integrating over the ranges of allowed energy, effective mass and transverse momenta, one obtains less than a 4% contribution of this background to the observed rate.

Footnote 1: This background can be seriously underestimated since the recent calculations [4] show that the cross-section for this process obtained in [1] was about one order of magnitude too small.

The background from'minimum bias events' (see Fig. 1d) can be estimated in a similar way. For the proposed setup, the rapidity range of the charged particles (assumed to be \(\pi^{+}\) and \(\pi^{-}\)) reaching the detectors is about \(4<y<6\). Using the same \(p_{t}\) distribution as above, a geometrical acceptance of less than 0.1% is obtained for observing a single particle (requiring emission angle \(<0.8\) mrad and energies in the 5-20 GeV range).

The purely hadronic events could mimic the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair production but they should be efficiently rejected by the trigger and selection cuts. If one assumes that on average four charged particles per rapidity unit per inelastic interaction are produced in the rapidity range of the luminosity detector (as plots in [6] suggest) then the expected rate of charged particles hitting one of the luminosity detectors is 4 MHz (\(=4\times 100\) mb \(\times 0.001\times 10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) at the nominal luminosity, and the requirement of no signal from the veto counters should suppress this by a factor 20. Assuming no correlations in the particle production such single rates would lead to coincidence rates of about 1 kHz which could be much suppressed after applying the cuts selecting elastically-produced \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs. The particles produced in decays have however correlated momenta and could increase the coincidence rate. For example, using the similar order of magnitude estimation as above, one expects the rate of the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs produced in Dalitz \(\pi^{0}\) decays\({}^{2}\) and hitting the detectors to be about 2 kHz. The selection cuts should reduce it by a factor of 2-3 resulting in about 20% background from the \(\pi^{0}\) decays. The \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs from other decays have smaller production rate and shallower distribution of \(M_{\it eff}\) and should generate smaller background.

The estimate of the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs production in the showers induced by high energy particles hitting the beam-pipe wall and magnet apertures requires the detailed simulation of the experimental setup. However, one expects much smaller contribution from this source as from the \(\pi^{0}\) decays because selection cuts are even more effective here with an additional rejection power due to the veto counters.

The background due to the production of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs in p-gas interactions is negligible for the rest gas pressures about 10\({}^{-10}\) Torr (see [1]).

To verify estimates of the non-elastic production of the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs a number of test runs at low LHC luminosities would be very useful. This would allow tagging of the non-elastic production mechanism using the central detectors and then direct measuring of its contribution to the observed rate of the forward \(e^{+}e^{-}\) production. During data-taking time, the contribution of the background processes could be estimated from the measured distributions of \(M_{\it eff}\), \(p_{t}\) and \(E_{+}+E_{-}\). The other backgrounds to the \(pp\to{\it pp}e^{+}e^{-}\) process can be monitored in the following ways:

* p-gas background can be measured with the non-colliding bunches.
* Beam halo can be measured with the non-colliding bunches and using timing information.
* Rates of accidental events could be controlled by measuring single rates from the calorimeters and the veto counters.

## Appendix E Accuracy

The kinematical variables used for the selection of the 'luminosity events' are the positron and electron energies, \(E_{+},E_{-}\), and:

\[M^{2}_{\it eff}\,=\,(p_{+}+p_{-})^{2}\approx\,2m_{e}^{2}+m_{e}^{2}\left(\frac{ E_{+}}{E_{-}}+\frac{E_{-}}{E_{+}}\right)+E_{+}E_{-}(\theta_{-}^{x}{}^{2}+\theta_{+}^{x}{}^{2 }+\theta_{-}^{y}{}^{2}+\theta_{+}^{y}{}^{2}-2\theta_{-}^{x}\theta_{+}^{x}-2 \theta_{-}^{y}\theta_{+}^{y}),\]

and

\[p_{t}^{2}=\,p_{+}^{x}p_{-}^{x}+p_{+}^{y}p_{-}^{y}\approx\,E_{+}E_{-}(\theta_{ +}^{x}\theta_{-}^{x}+\theta_{+}^{y}\theta_{-}^{y}),\]

where \(p_{+},p_{-}\) are the four-momenta of the produced \(e^{+},e^{-}\) and \(\theta_{+},\theta_{-}\) are their emission angles with respect to the beam axis at the IP (chosen along z-axis). The projection of the polar angles onto the \(x,z\) and \(y,z\) planes, \(\theta_{-}^{x},\,\theta_{+}^{x},\,\theta_{-}^{y},\,\theta_{+}^{y}\), can be inferred from the energies and transverse positions, \(x_{+}\), \(x_{-}\), \(y_{+}\), \(y_{-}\), of the electrons and positrons after the analyzing dipole:

\[\theta_{+(-)}^{x}\approx\,\left(x_{+(-)}-a_{+(-)}l_{m}/E_{+(-)}\right)\,/l_{ \it eff},\]

and

\[\theta_{+(-)}^{y}\approx\,y_{+(-)}/l_{\it eff},\]where \(a_{+(-)}=(-)0.1\) rad GeV measures the dipole bending power, and \(l_{det}\)=21 m and \(l_{m}\)=3 m are the distances between the detector and the IP and between the middle of the dipole and the detector, respectively.

For the assumed precision of the energy and position measurements (and for a perfect understanding of the bending dipole), the resolution of the \(\theta^{x}_{-}\), \(\theta^{x}_{+}\) measurement is limited by the energy resolution (\(\Delta\theta^{x}\approx 150\)\(\mu\)rad) for low energies and by the proton beam divergence (\(\Delta\theta^{x}\approx 40\)\(\mu\)rad) for high energies. The accuracy of the \(\theta^{y}_{-},\theta^{y}_{+}\) measurement is limited by the beam divergence at the IP and \(\Delta\theta^{y}\approx 40\)\(\mu\)rad. This results in about 10% relative resolution of the \(M_{eff}\) and \(p_{t}\) measurements near the threshold values.

The calibration of the calorimeters could be maintained with LED pulsers and 1 m.i.p. signals from beam-halo muons triggered using the veto counters. The analyzing dipole works as a spectrometer so the right energy scale can be inferred from the position vs. energy correlations. The (unavoidable) side-leakages may require fiducial cuts or the corrections using the measured impact position. Therefore, precise construction of the detector elements, positioning and survey should be ensured (with about \(\pm 0.1\)\(mm\) tolerances).

If the accuracy of energy scale could be maintained at the 1% level, and the position measurement systematic errors are smaller than the position resolution, then the error on the luminosity would be dominated by the energy uncertainties and should be below 3% (\(\Delta{\cal L}/{\cal L}\approx 2(\Delta E_{+}/E_{+}\oplus\Delta E_{-}/E_{-}\)). On the other hand, if the absolute position scale could be understood at a 0.3 mm level the accuracy of the measurement would be of about 1%, if for the final selection of the 'luminosity events' the position cuts were used rather than the energy ones. Of course, such a precision can be only reached once the background correction is not too large and is well controlled. At low and medium LHC luminosities the backgrounds due to pp inelastic processes might be efficiently reduced by requiring no activity in the detectors covering central rapidity range of the particle production.

At the highest LHC luminosities the precision of the measurement can be reduced due to the corrections on the event pile-up, i.e. due to a sizable probability for accidental background overlays on genuine 'luminosity events' resulting in event rejection. For 25 minimum bias events per bunch crossing, one expects for 0.1% geometrical acceptance and for eight charged particles produced in an inelastic pp collision (in \(4<y<6\) rapidity range) about 10% (= 100%[\(1-(1-25\times 8\times 0.001/2)^{2}\)]) reduction of the signal rate due to an overlay background event in any of the two detectors.

The number of checks can be done for monitoring the performance of the luminosity measurement:

* The measured size of the interaction region from beam scans should agree with the value obtained from the specific luminosity.
* If available, the experimental setup on the other side of the IP could have different acceptance ranges and different systematics.
* Dead-time free, single and coincidence rates of the 'luminosity', hadronic and p-gas events should be measured and recorded, to allow estimations of the accidental and p-gas background.

Conclusions and Outlook

Initial study of the luminosity measurement at LHC using elastic production of \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs presented in this paper indicates that this method could be possibly used for precise monitoring of the LHC luminosity. Its precision may however be seriously reduced at the nominal LHC luminosities due to high event rates. Additionally, the very high neutron and photon radiation fluences are expected at the proposed location of the luminosity detector according to the background studies in [7]. For example, at the nominal luminosity one expects behind TDS neutron fluences of about \(10^{8}\,\mathrm{particles/cm}^{2}/\mathrm{s}\). This may prove the measurement at high luminosities very difficult if not impossible. Therefore, one should consider the second scheme of the measurement of the forward-produced \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs where the detectors are located about 70 m from the IP and the background rates due to inelastic pp collisions are much less severe. Such detectors could allow measurement of particles produced at large rapidities, \(y>8\), and an interesting study of diffractive events at LHC. In such a case, both luminosity monitors could be used (and inter-calibrated) at low and medium luminosities but at the highest LHC luminosities only the detectors measuring very energetic \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs would be operational.

However, to reach definite conclusions and to prepare a more detailed detector proposal the following points have to be worked out:

* The signal and background cross-sections published in [1] and validity of the assumptions used in these calculations should be verified.
* The background due to the low-mass proton dissociation (followed by Dalitz decays of the produced \(\pi_{0}\)) has to be carefully studied.
* The order-of-magnitude estimates should be improved and compared with the predictions of the existing Monte Carlo generators and phenomenological models.
* The selections cuts should be optimized to minimize the background to signal ratio.
* More experimental effects have to be scrutinized, e. g. Coulomb scattering of the produced \(e^{+},e^{-}\) off the opposite proton beam and the background due to the penetrating muons.
* Feasibility of the modifications of the LHC beam-line required to accommodate the luminosity monitor detectors.
