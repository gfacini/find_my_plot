## 1 Abstract

The design specifications and the design constraints of the ATLAS semiconductor tracking system are briefly described. The extent to which the existing design will satisfy the design specifications is assessed.

## 2 Introduction

The ATLAS detector [1] is a multi-purpose detector being constructed for operation at the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC). When operating at the design luminosity of \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), an average of 23 proton-proton collisions will occur in the ATLAS collision region each 25 nsecs. The ATLAS Inner Tracking Detector [2] reconstructs charged tracks from these interactions, over the pseudo-rapidity interval \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\)2.5. The detector layout is shown in Figure 1.

The Inner Detector (ID) is a 6.8 m length cylinder which will surround the ATLAS interaction region of the CERN LHC. Its external active radius of 1.07 m is defined by the 5.3 m long superconducting coil of the 2 Tesla solenoidal magnet, whose inner cryostat radius is r = 1.15 m. Looking radially outwards from the interaction region, the ID consists in the central (forward) regions of:

* 3 silicon pixel layers (4 disks) in the radial range 4\(<\)r\(<\)20 cm providing space points of typical granularity \(\sim\)50 \(\times\)300 \(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\)[3],
* 4 silicon micro-strip layers (9 disks) in the range 26\(<\)r\(<\)56 cm [4], with each layer or disk providing both an r-\(\phi\) and a 40 mrad stereo measurement of granularity \(\sim\)80 \(\mu\)m\(\times\)12 \(cm\), and
* a straw tube tracker (the TRT) of lower granularity which provides typically 36 points with r-\(\phi\) precision \(\sim\)160 \(\mu\)m, and transition radiation information for electron identification.

Details of the semiconductor tracker (P+SCT) are listed in Table 1.

The total hadron fluence traversing the P + SCT detector has been estimated by Ferrari[5] following an integrated luminosity of 3 years at \(10^{40}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)yr\({}^{-1}\) and 7 years at \(10^{41}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)yr\({}^{-1}\)(the'standard' 10 year operating period). Normalised to the damage of 1 MeV neutrons in silicon, it reaches \(1.4\times 10^{14}\)n\({}_{eq}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) in the silicon strip detectors, and up to \(\sim 10^{15}\)n\({}_{eq}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) in the pixel detectors. This results in damage to the silicon detectors and their associated electronics [4],[3], and to ensure reasonable long-term performance, the detectors will be operated at -7\({}^{o}\)C. The internal radius of the pixel and SCT detectors are defined by the required detector signal:noise performance over the operating lifetime of the detector. For this reason, the r=4 cm pixel layer (the 'b-layer'), which is required for b-tagging even at high luminosity, will need to be replaced at regular intervals.

the planned high luminosity operation of the LHC, with high occupancy rates in the TRT, it is of interest to understand the stand-alone pattern recognition and track-fitting capability of the P + SCT, its robustness in the case of detector inefficiencies, uncorrelated noise, etc., and the level to which performance specifications are met.

The detector specifications relevant to this study concern both the pattern recognition and track precision of charged hadrons and leptons [2][6]. Pattern recognition specifications include:

* that the track reconstruction efficiency of isolated \(\pi^{\pm}\) tracks with transverse momentum \(p_{T}>\)5 GeV/c be \(\epsilon>95\%\) with a fake rate of \(<\)1%
* the reconstruction efficiency of tracks with \(p_{T}>\)1 GeV/c be \(\epsilon>90\%\) with a fake rate of \(<\)10% within a (\(\eta-\phi<0.25\)) cone about a high \(p_{T}\) track,
* the track reconstruction efficiency during operation at low luminosity be \(\epsilon>95\%\) for all tracks with \(p_{T}>\)0.5 GeV/c.

Primary electron track reconstruction will be affected primarily by the detector material, which is not directly specified as an upper limit; the aim of the detector is to:

* reconstruct high \(p_{T}\) electron tracks (\(>\)7 GeV/c), and low \(p_{T}\) (\(>\)0.5 GeV/c) tracks in the vicinity of the high \(p_{T}\) track with an efficiency of \(\epsilon>\)90%,
* reconstruct all electrons of \(p_{T}>\)1 GeV/c with an efficiency of \(\epsilon>\)70% during low-luminosity operation.

Of particular importance is the measurement precision of found tracks, and of primary vertices or secondary vertices from b-decay. Listed specifications require that

* including the TRT, the momentum resolution at \(p_{T}=\)500 GeV/c is \(p_{T}\times\sigma(1/p_{T})<\)0.3 for \(|\eta\)\(|<\)2.0 and \(<\)0.5 for \(|\eta\)\(|<\)2.5 (there is no listed requirement at lower \(p_{T}\) and the dominating effect of multiple scattering will be shown),
* adequate impact parameter precision, and a resolution of primary vertices with at least 4 tracks of \(\sigma(z)<\)1 mm,
* an ability to reconstruct secondary vertices from b-decays, with an efficiency for tagging b-jets of \(\epsilon>\)0.5 for a non-b hadronic

rejection of at least 50 (this latter requirement is model-dependent and assumes current QCD cross-section extrapolations [7]).

Contrary to existing hadron collider detectors (for example CDF and D0 at the Fermilab Tevatron Collider), the large track multiplicity and difficult operating conditions force the use of large semiconductor-based tracking detectors. This results in a substantial material budget, adversely affecting (due to multiple scattering, bremsstrahlung and photon conversions) both the precision and efficiency of reconstructed tracks. Figure 2 shows the material seen by a track as a function of \(\mid\eta\mid\), and evaluated in units of radiation length (\(X_{0}\)) and absorption length (\(\lambda_{0}\)). Preceding the outer sensitive region of the P + SCT, the total material reaches almost \(0.4X_{0}\), resulting in frequent shower initiation The material results mainly from the electrical and cooling services, and is accentuated by multiple traversals of the pixel services within the P + SCT sensitive volume.

## 3 Detector modelling

As described in detail elsewhere [2], a full simulation of the Inner Detector has been made using GEANT [8], including best estimates of the detector, support and service material, and parametrisations of detector signal, noise, and resolution from test beam data and design predictions. In the case of the P + SCT, a hit efficiency of \(\epsilon=\)0.97 is assumed as default, with a fractional noise contribution of \(\sim 10^{-4}\) (\(\sim 10^{-5}\) for pixels).

Studies of the detector performance have been made using isolated tracks (p, \(\pi^{\pm}\), \(\mu^{\pm}\), e\({}^{\pm}\)), and

The pixel granularity is 50\(\mu\)m\(\times\)300\(\mu\)m in the barrel, while each barrel SCT layer consists of 2 silicon layers of granularity \(\sim\)80\(\mu\)m\(\times\)12.4 cm, with a stereo angle of 40 mrads. The granularity in the forward direction is radially dependent, with approximately the same values as in the barrel [2].

non-isolated tracks generated using PYTHIA [7] for the process:

\[p+p\to H^{0}+W^{\pm}+X;H^{0}\to b\overline{b}\]

with \(m_{H}\)=400 GeV. This process is very representative of the likely track density for top-quark, Higgs, and concievable super-symmetric particle production processes at LHC (there are typically 10 charged tracks within an \(\eta-\phi<\)0.4 cone). In future, a lower-\(p_{T}\) non-isolated track sample will be studied.

## 4 Pattern recognition and measurement precision for isolated tracks

Two pattern recognition algorithms are being developed by ATLAS. One, called XKalman [9], creates a road in the TRT and projects the tracks into the P + SCT from large radius. The second, called iPatRec [10], reconstructs tracks in a combinatorial search of precision hits, and optionally projects the track into the TRT for track verification and at high \(p_{T}\) improved track fitting. The final pattern recognition algorithm will combine their advantages; however, at present iPatRec is required to evaluate the stand-alone P + SCT performance.

The standard iPatRec selection requires at least 7 precision hits (from 3 space points in the pixel, \(\sim\)8 strips in the SCT) with very loose quality cuts on each hit, and at most one missing layer between successive hits ('type I'). This latter requirement is relaxed in the case of a TRT confirmation. A second track selection ('type II') relevant to prompt or b-decay tracks requires 9 precision P + SCT hits, with a b-layer and one other pixel hit, and a cut of 1 mm on the transverse impact position.

The reconstruction of isolated tracks is in principle not difficult; its relevance is to understand inherent limitations of (for example) material, detector inefficiencies, etc. The direct consequence of material is evident in Figure 3, which lists the number of precision and TRT hits for an isolated \(\pi^{\pm}\) or \(e^{\pm}\) of \(p_{T}\) =1 GeV/c. While the \(\mu^{\pm}\) track efficiency is \(>\)99% for all \(\mid\eta\mid\), 10% (30%) of \(\pi^{\pm}\) (\(e^{\pm}\)) tracks have no confirmed TRT hit; for \(p_{T}\) =20 GeV/C, this is reduced to 5% (14%). The \(\mid\eta\mid\)dependence of the (type I) track efficiency is shown in Figure 4, for isolated \(\pi^{\pm}\) or \(e^{\pm}\). At \(p_{T}\) = 20 GeV/c, \(\epsilon_{el}\approx\)0.83 in the range 1.4\(<\mid\eta\mid<\)2.2. The above results assume a uniform solenoidal field in the detector volume. This may be deteriorated in the forward direction due to the non-uniform field; a \(p_{T}\) =5 GeV/c track at \(\mid\eta\mid\) =2.0 deviates by \(\approx\)100 \(\mu\)m in the SCT volume.

Despite the relaxed track selection criteria, the fake rate remains \(<10^{-5}\). Furthermore the reconstruction efficiency remains robust to detector deterioration in the case of isolated tracks, and to the pileup of superimposed minimum bias events, given a small increase in the fake rate. Because of material effects, however, the stated requirements of the tracker are not fully met for isolated tracks.

The hadron track measurement accuracy is limited at low \(p_{T}\) by multiple scattering, and at high \(p_{T}\) by the magnetic deflection. Figure 5 shows an analytic evaluation of the \(\mid\eta\mid\)dependence of \(\sigma(1/p_{T})\) (including the TRT, and a transverse beam constraint of 15\(\mu\)m) for \(p_{T}\) =500 GeV/c tracks. The specification is approximately met for \(\mid\eta\mid<\)2; beyond that value, the track resolution deteriorates because of the limited tracker length and the field non-uniformity. At lower \(p_{T}\), \(\sigma(1/p_{T})\) is dominated by multiple scattering; at \(p_{T}\) =20 GeV/c, \(\sigma(1/p_{T})\) varies between 0.8 and 1.2 \(TeV^{-1}\). The P+SCT stand-alone high-\(p_{T}\) measurement accuracy is deteriorated for \(\pi^{\pm}\) by a factor \(\approx\)2 before multiple scattering effects, with \(\sigma(1/p_{T})\)=0.7 in the range \(\mid\eta\mid<\)2.

The impact parameter d\({}_{0}\) for \(\pi^{\pm}\) tracks is dependent on the b-layer performance; it is not strongly \(\mid\eta\mid\)dependent (see below), but is dominated at low \(p_{T}\) by multiple scattering in the pixel layers. The expected performance is:

\[\sigma_{T}(d_{0})=11(1\oplus 5.5\sin\theta/p_{T})^{1/2})\mu m\]

\[\sigma_{T}(d_{0})=70(1\oplus 1.4\sin\theta/p_{T})^{1/2})\mu m\]

with \(p_{T}\) measured in units of GeV/c. The longitudinal accuracy is largely dependent on the pixel measurement precision.

The specification of track measurement precision assumed Gaussian uncertainties. In the case of electrons, the errors are not Gaussian. While the effects of bremsstrahlung can be corrected on average given a knowledge of the bremstrahlung position, the measurement accuracy cannot be improved; in this paper we indicate the performance before bremstrahlung recovery. Figure 6 compares the statistical momentum pulls for e\({}^{\pm}\) and \(\pi^{\pm}\) of \(p_{T}\)=20 GeV/c (since more material is traversed, the electron fit is further deteriorated if the TRT is included). Both the reconstructed \(p_{T}\) and its uncertainty are sensitively affected by the material, especially for electrons (see figure 7 showing the r.m.s. width of the \(p_{T}\) pull distribution at \(p_{T}\)=20 GeV/c). The value of \(\sigma_{T}(d_{0})\) is also deteriorated in the case of electrons, from a mean of 14.8 \(\mu\)m for \(\pi^{\pm}\) of \(p_{T}\) =20 GeV/c to 25.3 \(\mu\)m for electrons.

## 5 Pattern recognition and measurement precision for non-isolated tracks

It has been shown that the pattern recognition efficiency depends crucially on the material traversed, for isolated tracks. This is confirmed for tracks of \(p_{T}>1\) GeV/c in the region of a b-jet, at low luminosity.

Figure 4: _Track reconstruction efficiency of isolated electron or \(\pi^{+}\) tracks of \(p_{T}\)=20 GeV/c._

Figure 3: _Number of (a) precision and (b) TRT hits on electron or \(\pi^{+}\) tracks of \(p_{T}\)=1 GeV/c._

Using the track selections previously described, Figure 8 shows the \(\pi^{\pm}\) reconstruction efficiency as a function of \(\mid\eta\mid\) for tracks of \(p_{T}>\)1 GeV/c.

The track efficiency (average 93% for selection I), closely reflects the superimposed material up to and including the second SCT layer. This is also reflected by the \(\mid\eta\mid\)distribution of fake and secondary tracks. Fake tracks, which are principally reconstructed secondary tracks incorrectly associated with a pixel hit, account for 0.5% of reconstructed tracks (1.3% at \(\mid\eta\mid\)=1.7). Identified secondary tracks that are reconstructed by the P+SCT mainly result from interactions in the pixel or inner SCT layers. Those secondaries resulting from interactions in the pixel b-layer are irreducible; the other reconstructed secondary tracks generally have an incorrect b-layer association, because of the high occupancy of that layer in a b-jet environment. This has the effect of distorting the fit parameters in a non-Gaussian way. The secondary rate varies between 2.5% at \(\mid\eta\mid\)=0, and 10% at \(\mid\eta\mid\)=1.7. Because of the bad hit associations, secondary and fake tracks can be drastically reduced at the expense of reconstruction efficiency. For example, with a track efficiency of 88% for 'type II' selections, the secondary rate is reduced to 1.8%, and significantly more if a track fit probability selection \(P_{trk}>\)1% is applied to the fitted track.

Using the 'type I' track selection, Figure 9 shows the track reconstruction efficiency as a function of angular separation from neighbouring tracks. This distribution clearly illustrates the advantages of good granularity in the pixel and SCT detectors.

The above results apply to \(\pi^{\pm}\) tracks at low luminosity. The pattern recognition of electrons in a non-isolated environment has not yet been systematically studied, and the study must be repeated after high-luminosity pileup effects are included.

The only deterioration of measurement precision for found \(\pi^{\pm}\) tracks is from the assignment of wrong or spoilt hits, which results in a wrong or spoilt hit inclusion in the fit. The rate of at least one wrong (spoilt) hit is 3.6% (6.6%) for the pixels, and 1.9% (17.2%) for the SCT. The number of primary tracks with reconstructed 1/or \(d_{0}(transverse)\) outside the 3\(\sigma\) limit increases to 5.0% (3.7%) using the present algorithms; the central Gaussian distribution, however, is left almost unaffected. The rate of spoilt hits in the SCT is a direct reflection of the detector granularity. It is believed that future algorithm developments will successfully reduce the proportion of spoilt or bad hits.

On the basis of type II track fits, Figure 10 shows the expected efficiency of b-jets (as generated by PYTHIA) compared to the rejection against non-b QCD processes. For a 50% b-jet efficiency, a rejection R\({}_{u}\)=66 is achieved. By requiring a track fit probability P\({}_{trk}>\)0.01, a value R\({}_{u}\)=83 is obtained. Because the distribution of d\({}_{0}\) for secondaries is non-Gaussian, R\({}_{u}>\)100 after their exclusion. This very important result may be significantly improved by 3-dimensional vertexing techniques, but already meets the specifications laid out for the tracker. There is no significant effect of TRT information on this result.

## 6 Robustness of pattern recognition

The results of the previous section were obtained using a fully operational P + SCT detector. The harsh operational environment makes such operation unlikely. It is therefore relevant to understand the effect of detector inefficiency, and the non-inclusion of an SCT or pixel layer.

This study has been made using the non-isolated event sample. The removal of an SCT layer has the effect of reducing the track reconstruction efficiency (by several %) with approximately unchanged fake and secondary rates. The track efficiency is recoverable, at the expense of a small increase in the fake rate. Furthermore, R\({}_{u}\) is only slightly deteriorated, from R\({}_{u}\)=66 to R\({}_{u}\)=62. The effect of removing a pixel layer (assumed here not to be the b-layer which plays an especially important role for b-tagging) is more serious. While the track reconstruction efficiency is only slightly affected, the track precision is affected by wrong pixel associations. As a result R\({}_{u}\) deteriorates to a value of 36.

Using the same data sample, but with a type

II track selection together with a track probability requirement, P\({}_{tr\,k}>\)0.01 (corresponding to a track reconstruction \(\epsilon_{tr\,k}\)=0.87 with fake and secondary rates of 0.06% and 0.4% respectively, and R\({}_{u}\)=83 for 50% b-tagging efficiency), both \(\epsilon_{trk}\) and R\({}_{u}\) have been studied as a function of the fraction of random non-operational front-end electronics chips (considered to be a likely failure modularity). Figure 11 shows the track reconstruction efficiency as a function of the fraction of non-operational chips. The efficiency deteriorates almost linearly, with no significant increase of the fake and secondary rates. Figure 12 shows the same dependence of R\({}_{u}\), for a 50% b-tag efficiency. This indicates very marginal stand-alone performance if more than 5% of all chips malfunction.

## 7 Conclusions

We have reported on the stand-alone performance of the silicon pixel and micro-strip tracking detector planned for the ATLAS experiment. Assuming full operation of the detector, the track efficiency and measurement accuracy of \(\mu^{\pm}\) and \(\pi^{\pm}\) tracks is close to the required tracker specification for both isolated and non-isolated tracks. However, because of the effect of material within the active tracker volume, the low-momentum charged hadron performance is deteriorated. The b-tagging performance reaches the stated specification, despite the effect of material.

However, the effect of material is very marked for electrons, with significant non-Gaussian tails in the accuracy of p\({}_{T}\), and the impact parameter d\({}_{0}\).

It has also been shown that the malfunctioning of a pixel layer, or any significant loss of front-end chip functionality, will result in an unacceptable degradation of performance.
