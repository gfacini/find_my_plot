This document summarizes the 2016 trigger menu of the ATLAS experiment employed during data taking of proton-proton collisions at the LHC and describes improvements and changes with respect to the trigger menu used throughout 2015.

## 3 Trigger menu in 2016

During the 2016 LHC proton-proton run the instantaneous luminosity reached up to \(L=1.4\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and therefore changes to the trigger menu employed during 2015 became necessary. In general, the trigger menu strategy is based on the following building blocks:

* primary triggers, which are used for physics measurements and are typically running unprescaled;
* support triggers, which are used for efficiency and performance measurements, background estimates or monitoring, and are typically running at a small rate (of the order of 0.5 Hz each);
* alternative triggers, which are running alternative online reconstruction algorithms, as primary or support selections;
* backup triggers, with tighter selections and lower expected rate, in case the rate of the main (primary) trigger becomes higher than tolerable or allowed;
* calibration triggers, which are used for detector calibrations and are often running at high rate but storing very small events with only the relevant information from the detector needed for the calibrations.

The complete trigger menu has to respect all technical limitations (at Level-1 and HLT), which makes the optimal distribution of the available bandwidth as well as the CPU consumption challenging. The distribution is driven by the physics priorities of the experiment, and the number of clients satisfied by a particular trigger. About 20% of the HLT bandwidth is dedicated to the supporting triggers. Recorded events are gathered in so-called data streams, depending on their primary use case and their specific offline reconstruction needs. Figure 1 shows the average recording rate of the physics data stream of all ATLAS pp runs taken in 2016. Due to decreasing luminosity during the run, the average rate is about two thirds of the peak rate. Events for physics analyses are recorded at an average rate of approximately 1 kHz.

Figure 1: The average recording rate of the physics data stream for each ATLAS pp run taken in 2016. The total average of all runs is indicated as dotted line.

The main triggers that compose the ATLAS \(1.2\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) trigger menu (aiming to cover the \(1.2-1.4\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) luminosity region) and their measured rates are shown in Table 1. For peak luminosities below \(1.0\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) looser selections are deployed in some cases.

With respect to the trigger menu employed during 2015 [2] several changes are implemented. In general, the online \(p_{T}\) requirements, also referred to as _thresholds_, are only slightly tightened. For the single electron and muon triggers relative isolation requirements are employed both at the L1 and HLT and as a result the thresholds could be kept at 27. For the default trigger chain which is used in many searches for physics beyond the Standard Model, an improved reconstruction algorithm at HLT is used with a slightly increased threshold of 110. In contrast, the same L1 selection as in 2015 is used. The b-jet triggers in 2016 use multivariate identification algorithms as employed offline with six different operating points. Several combined trigger chains are added to the menu in order to efficiently select events for analyses with rich event topologies. These chains typically do not increase the overall trigger rate significantly. In addition, various improvements to the online reconstruction algorithms are deployed by porting offline reconstruction algorithms and calibrations as much as possible to the HLT.

## 4 Trigger system improvements

The increase in the instantaneous luminosity over the 2015 data taking period manifests itself in a steady increase of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing. The dependence of the various trigger rates, the trigger signal efficiencies and the CPU consumption of HLT algorithms on the number of pile-up interactions differs for the various trigger signatures. Especially tracking algorithms and global calorimeter-based trigger signatures like total energy and show a non-linear dependence on the number of pile-up interactions. Constant improvements of the trigger algorithms as well as of the trigger menu are necessary to cope with these changing conditions and to ensure an efficient triggering for the broad physics analysis program of the ATLAS experiment.

The most recent improvements with respect to the trigger system performance in 2015 [2] are briefly described in the following subsections.

### Improvements to the Level-1 muon trigger

Due to the strict timing requirements on the Level-1 trigger system, the Level-1 muon trigger decision is based on hits in the Resistive Plate Chamber detectors (RPC) in the barrel region and the Thin Gap Chamber detectors (TGC) in the forward region of the detector [3]. The degree of deviation from the hit pattern expected for a muon with infinite momentum is used to estimate the of the muon candidate based on six possible thresholds. Several improvements to the L1 muon trigger detailed below are employed throughout 2016.

#### 4.1.1 Improved RPC chamber coverage

In preparation of Run 2, additional RPC detectors were installed in the region of weight-support structures ("fect" region) and elevator shafts in order to increase the geometrical acceptance of the Level-1 muon trigger by about 4%. Most of these additional chambers were successfully commissioned in 2015 and are fully incorporated into the Level-1 system in 2016. Figure 2 shows a comparison of the Level-1 muon efficiency as a function of of of the reconstructed muon with data collected in 2015 and 2016. In the feet region (\(-2<\phi<-1\)) a clear improvement of the trigger efficiency is observed. An additional 1% increase in efficiency spread throughout the geometrical RPC coverage was gained by restoring malfunctioning or disconnected gas gaps during the 2015/2016 winter shutdown.

#### 4.1.2 Level-1 muon trigger coincidence logic

The L1 triggers generated by hits in the RPC require a coincidence of hits in the three layers for the highest three thresholds (11, 15 and 20 GeV), and a coincidence of hits in two of the three layers for the other three thresholds (4, 6 and 10 GeV). The L1 triggers generated by hits in the TGC have two measurement directions: wire (bending) and strip (non-bending) and generally require a coincidence of hits of both types in three layers, except for the lowest muon threshold.

In the forward region the L1 trigger rates are generally dominated by low- charged particles (e.g. protons). In order to suppress the rate from such backgrounds, a new coincidence logic was deployed in 2015, requiring a hit in the Forward Inner (FI) station in the geometrical coverage of this detector(\(1.3<|\eta|<1.9\)), which is depicted in Figure 3. In 2016, this logic is extended also to the Endcap Inner (EI) station (\(1.05<|\eta|<1.3\)). This successfully reduces the rate of high \(p_{T}\) muon triggers in the forward region as shown in Figure 4. In order to limit the impact on the signal efficiency, the coincidence is only required in regions of the (\(\eta,\phi\)) space where the rate is indeed background dominated. Therefore, the efficiency loss is limited to below 1% while the rate of L1_MU20 (at least one muon candidate at L1 with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV) is lowered by approximately 20%.

From August 2016 onward, an additional new coincidence logic for the lowest \(p_{T}\) muon trigger requires hits in three instead of only two stations in the non-bending direction, as well as in the bending direction for limited areas. This reduces the rate from background particles and improves the rate dependence on the number of pile-up interactions significantly, as shown in Figure 5, while the signal efficiency is only reduced by a few percent. For example, in data-taking conditions corresponding to 30 proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing on average (\(<\mu>=30\)), the L1 rate for events with at least two muons with \(p_{T}>4\) GeV (L1_2MU4) is reduced from 75 kHz to 30 kHz.

Besides the newly implemented requirement of a hit in a third station, additional improvements have been made in the overlap removal algorithm. This change improves the ambiguity resolution in triggers with more than one muon so that an additional rate reduction (approximately 25% for a trigger requiring two muons with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV) is achieved without a significant efficiency loss.

### Commissioning of the Level-1 topological trigger

During the LHC long shutdown starting in 2013, a new electronics sub-system was introduced in the real-time data processing path: the Topological Processor System (L1Topo). It consists of two Level-1 topological processor blades. They receive real-time information from the Level-1 calorimeter and muon

Figure 2: Absolute efficiency of Level 1 trigger for at least one muon with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV in 2015 (black) and in 2016 (red) plotted as a function of \(\phi\) of offline muon candidates in the barrel detector region. The efficiency is computed with respect to offline isolated muon candidates which are reconstructed using standard ATLAS software and are required to pass _medium_ quality requirement. The efficiency is measured using a tag-and-probe method with \(Z\rightarrow\mu\mu\) candidates, with no background subtraction applied, in 13 TeV data from 2015 and 2016 with 25 ns LHC bunch spacing. Only statistical data uncertainties are shown. Due to temporary failures some muon trigger stations are disabled in some runs, leading to a lower measured efficiency in that region.

triggers, which is processed by four individual state-of-the-art FPGAs 2. The Level-1 topological trigger processor [4] can combine information about several objects into topological information about the event. This new functionality is used to greatly enhance the background rejection at Level-1 for specific signatures like high-mass di-jet pairs from vector boson fusion processes, di-muon systems with low opening angle and specific mass from \(B\)-hadron decays and other final states. These complex calculations are executed in hardware within 200 ns. The new L1Topo system was successfully commissioned during proton-proton collisions in 2016 and has been used to collect data since September 2016. Some performance aspects for selected trigger chains are summarised below.

#### 4.2.1 Selection of events with large transverse energy from hadronic jets

Figure 6 shows measurements of the trigger rates and the efficiencies of L1Topo chains requiring large transverse energy from jets (\(H_{T}\)) above a certain \(p_{T}\) threshold (\(p_{T}>20(15)\) GeV) within a given pseudorapidity range (\(|\eta|<3.1(2.1)\)). Similar selections are often employed in physics analysis targeting fully hadronic final states.

#### 4.2.2 Selection of events with lepton pairs

Due to the low transverse momentum of muons originating from meson decays, the trigger selection for \(B\)-hadron physics analyses is particularly challenging in the high luminosity environment of the LHC. The kinematic properties of collimated tracks and a well defined invariant mass of the di-muon system allows the trigger to select such decays at higher purity if topological information is taken into account. A

Figure 3: A schematic view of the Muon Spectrometer with lines indicating various pseudorapidity regions. The curved arrow shows an example of a trigger due to slow particles generated at the beam pipe around \(z=10\) m. Triggers due to events of this type are mitigated by requiring an additional coincidence with the TGC chambers in the \(1.3<|\eta|<1.9\) region (TGC-FI) and the TGC chambers in the \(1.05<|\eta|<1.3\) region (TGC-EI).

similar situation is encountered in searches for lepton flavour violating (LFV) decays of tau leptons. Such decays would produce collimated low momentum electrons and muons. If the opening angle between such leptons is part of the trigger decision, the momentum thresholds can be substantially lowered.

Figure 7 shows the number of events selected by an L1Topo algorithm for selecting \(B\)-hadron candidate events of a given invariant mass in comparison to a trigger selecting an unbiased event sample of low \(p_{T}\) muon pairs. The L1 rate reduction achieved by L1Topo is approximately a factor of four, and a reduction of the efficiency of approximately 12% at HLT due to the selection requirements as well as the difference in resolution of muon direction reconstruction at L1 and HLT.

#### 4.2.3 Selection of events with hadronically decaying tau leptons

Triggering on the presence of hadronically decaying tau leptons at L1 is challenging due to the high background rate from multijet events and the limited amount of information about the internal structure of the energy deposition of the hadronic shower. At the same time, in final states like \(H\rightarrow\tau_{\rm had}\tau_{\rm had}\), triggering on hadronically decaying tau leptons with low transverse momentum is crucial. To significantly reduce the dominant multi-jet background, angular requirements, e.g. \(\Delta R(\tau,\tau)<2.4\), are typically used and feature a relatively high signal acceptance especially when employed in combination with a requirement of an additional high \(p_{T}\) jet [5]. With the incorporation of L1Topo, these requirements can also be implemented at L1.

As can be seen in Figure 8, the angular requirement and the additional jet requirement allow rate reductions by a factor of 3.9 and 3.4, respectively, with respect to the basic di-tau L1 trigger. Applying both of those requirement at the same time leads to an additional rate reduction of nearly 45%.

Figure 4: The pseudo-rapidity distributions of the L1 muon trigger with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV (L1_MU20), using events taken by a L1 muon trigger requiring \(p_{T}>11\) GeV in 2016. In this sample, the Endcap Inner (EI)/Forward Inner (FI) coincidence decision made online was not applied however it is recorded as a flag. The coincidence logic required a hit in the FI station in 2015, and in 2016 this logic is extended also to EI. No rate reduction is seen at \(|\eta|\approx 1.5\) because the coincidence is not required due to the presence of inactive FI chambers. Moreover, the coincidence is currently not required at \(|\eta|\approx 1.2\) to allow for the commissioning of the Tile-Muon coincidence planned to be deployed in the future.

These trigger rate reductions are achieved while keeping low \(p_{T}\) thresholds on the hadronically decaying taus and high signal acceptance. Figure 9 shows the efficiency of the algorithm selecting close-by tau pairs in an unbiased event sample collected by a di-tau trigger without topological requirements. This algorithm is fully efficient for tau pairs with \(\Delta R(\tau,\tau)<2.4\), which are typical for signal events in which the transverse momentum of the reconstructed Higgs boson exceeds 100 GeV (Figure 10).

Similarly, Figures 11 and 12 show that adding a jet requirement to the L1Topo angular selection does not lead to a reduction of signal efficiency, and, on the contrary, can result in higher signal efficiencies with respect to non-L1Topo di-tau and jet selection at lower values of the jet \(p_{T}\).

### Bunch-crossing position dependent pile-up correction of calorimeter energy

The ATLAS Liquid Argon Calorimeter features a bipolar pulse shape of its signal over a time window of about 600 ns, corresponding to 24 bunch crossings of bunches seperated by 25 ns. This introduces a dependence of the average amplitude on the number of collisions happening prior to the current bunch crossing, often referred to as out-of-time pile-up. Collisions happening at the beginning of a bunch train therefore have a higher average amplitude than collisions happening in the middle or the end of a bunch train. This dependence of the pedestal on the bunch crossing position has been corrected for during offline reconstruction since 2012 and at L1 since 2015. In 2016 a bunch-crossing position dependent pedestal

Figure 5: Trigger cross section of L1_2MU4 (black), L1_MU6_2MU4 (blue), and L1_3MU4 (magenta) are shown as a function of the average number of interactions per LHC bunch crossing, where L1_2MU4 requires two L1 muons with \(p_{T}>4\) GeV, L1_MU6_2MU4 requires two L1 muons with \(p_{T}>6,4\) GeV, and L1_3MU4 requires three L1 muons with \(p_{T}>4\) GeV. The cross sections are shown for two different data sets taken with different TGC hits coincidence requirement: 2 stations coincidence (dashed lines) and 3 stations coincidence except for some regions in the \((R,\eta)\) plane (markers).

correction is introduced at HLT, allowing for a significant reduction of trigger rates from calorimeter objects at the beginning of a bunch train. The improvement in the resolution is shown in Figure 13, which shows the \(E_{T}\) resolution for online (HLT) topo-clusters with respect to offline topo-clusters with \(E_{T}>3\) GeV in data collected in 2015 and 2016. Two different histograms show the resolution in events from all bunch crossings and only those in the first 12 crossings within a bunch train. While for both a clear improvement in the resolution is seen, the energy clusters within the first bunch crossings of a bunch train are now on average nearly as well reconstructed as in any other bunch crossing.

### Updates to the jet calibration at the high-level trigger

The current ATLAS jet calibration procedure differs between trigger and offline environments, mostly due to differences in the pile-up correction, track-based corrections and _in-situ_ data corrections. These differences impact the trigger performance in the form of additional resolution sources, which manifest as the sharpness of the trigger efficiency curve. The single-jet trigger is typically used only where it is fully efficient, and therefore the added resolution represents a significant source of rate which remains unused.

For possible developments in future menus, an additional single-jet trigger (requiring \(p_{T}>400\) GeV) was added in 2016 in order to commission an improved jet energy calibration scheme. The improvements include revised MC calibrations, the addition of global sequential corrections, and the application of _in-situ_ corrections.

The global sequential calibration [6] corrects jets according to their longitudinal shower shape and associated track characteristics without changing the overall energy scale. These track-based corrections represent a significant part of the difference between the calibration of offline and HLT jets, and are thus an important addition.

Figure 6: Trigger efficiency (left) and rates (right) of L1Topo trigger items based on the \(H_{T}\) algorithm. HT150_J20_ETA31 (HT190_J15_ETA21) requires the transverse energy sum of jets with \(p_{T}>20(15)\) GeV and \(|\eta|<3.1(2.1)\) to be above 150(190) GeV.

The data-driven dijet \(\eta\)-intercalibration correction [7] is the most significant _in-situ_ correction added. This correction fixes the difference in jet response as a function of \(\eta\), thereby reducing resolution differences between the trigger and offline reconstruction across the detector.

Together, these corrections allow for significantly improved agreement between the scale of trigger and offline jets. This can be seen by comparing the trigger efficiencies for a single jet trigger requiring \(p_{T}>380\) and a single jet trigger using the new calibration and requiring \(p_{T}>400\) GeV, as shown in Figure 14. The new calibration allows for the same or even a slightly lower offline full efficiency \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold for the lowest unprescaled single-jet trigger, while reducing the rate of the trigger by approximately 20%.

### \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) triggers at HLT

As \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is a global event level variable, its rate is strongly affected by the number of collisions per bunch crossing, since each proton-proton collision adds to the total energy deposited in the calorimeter. While complex correction techniques mitigate these effects to a large extent in the offline reconstruction, at trigger level these resolution effects lead to a strong increase of the trigger rate with rising pile-up. Several options exist to reconstruct the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) at the HLT. The _missing_\(H_{\mathrm{T}}\) (MHT) algorithm calculates \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) as the negative sum of transverse energy of calibrated anti-\(k_{t}\) jets, where those jets are constructed from calibrated topological clusters of calorimeter cells. The _cell algorithm_ is instead based on the negative

Figure 7: Plot of invariant mass distribution for pairs of oppositely charged offline reconstructed muons, shown for events passing a nominal HLT trigger chain (triangles) and the equivalent HLT chain with additional L1Topo requirements (circles). The offline muon pairs are fit to a common vertex, using the inner detector track parameters. The two triggers chains each require two muons at L1, passing thresholds of \(p_{T}>6\) GeV. They are confirmed at the HLT, requiring oppositely charged muons originating from a common vertex, based on the inner detector track parameters. Their invariant mass is required to match the \(B\)-hadron mass range. L1Topo algorithm makes additional requirements that the L1 muons form an invariant mass between 2 and 9 GeV and have opening angle between 0.2 and 1.5.

sum of transverse energy deposited in calorimeter cells above a certain noise threshold. While the cell algorithm calculates \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) on the electromagnetic scale, the MHT algorithm uses jets calibrated to the jet energy scale, so that numerical threshold values for similar signal efficiencies differ. A third algorithm (_pufit_) tries to disentangle calorimeter deposits from the hard-scatter from those originating from pile-up interactions by grouping towers made out of topological clusters into a pile-up and a hard-scatter category. This grouping is based on their energy, where the threshold itself is dependent on the overall event activity measured by the total energy deposited in the calorimeter. Assuming that the contribution to \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) from pile-up interactions is zero, a minimisation taking into account resolution terms determines an effective

Figure 8: Level-1 rates before prescale versus instantaneous luminosity for L1 di-tau triggers. All triggers require two isolated hadronic taus with \(E_{T}>20,12\) GeV. One L1 trigger requires the presence of an additional jet with \(E_{T}>25\) GeV based on an object counting performed at CTP (blue squares). The topological cut \(\Delta R<2.9\) between the two taus is applied by the L1Topo hardware (red triangles). One L1Topo trigger requires the presence of a jet with \(E_{T}>25\) GeV which is not overlapping in \(\Delta R<1.0\) with the two taus (pink triangles). Data have been collected in pp collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in 2016. The numerical values on the right hand side correspond to the rates at a luminosity of \(1.2\times 10^{34}\)\(cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

energy density from pile-up interaction which allows a vanishing contribution to \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) by the pile-up calorimeter towers. This correction is then subtracted from the hard-scatter towers. The final \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) value is then determined from the negative sum of transverse energy of those pile-up corrected hard-scatter towers.

Figure 15 shows the trigger cross section of various \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) triggers, determined from the online rate and luminosity, as a function of the pile-up. The MHT algorithm was employed as baseline \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) trigger chain in 2016. By requiring that the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) reconstructed at the HLT by both algorithms (cell and MHT) exceed a certain minimal value the dependence of the rate on the pile-up activity can be reduced. An even stronger reduction is achieved by the pile-up correction algorithm. Figure 16 shows the cumulative efficiency of

Figure 11: The left figure shows the selection efficiency of an L1Topo algorithm selecting events with close-by pairs of hadronically decaying tau leptons and an additional jet as a function of offline reconstructed jet \(p_{T}\) and the distance in (\(\eta,\phi\)) between the reconstructed tau leptons (\(\Delta R(\tau,\tau)\)). The right figure shows the efficiency of the same algorithm as a function of offline jet \(p_{T}\) and compares it to the efficiency of a similar L1 trigger without topological requirements. The event sample was selected by an inclusive di-tau trigger.

Figure 10: Distribution of the \(\Delta R\) seperation of the two reconstructed tau candidates with highest \(p_{T}\) and matched to the trigger objects in simulated \(H\to\tau\tau\) events. Events are required to pass a typical analysis region requirement of \(p_{T}^{H}>100\) GeV and the L1Topo trigger requiring the presence of two close by tau candidates (red dashed line). The blue line shows the same distribution if instead a classical L1 trigger is used.

these \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) trigger chains, relative to a trigger requiring the MHT \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) to exceed 110 GeV, as a function of the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) reconstructed offline in a sample of events passing a loose \(W\to\mu\nu\) selection. While the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) (_puff_) chain offers the strongest reduction in rate as a function of the pile-up activity, it reaches the efficiency plateau as quickly as the logical combination of the two reconstruction algorithms. Therefore, it is a good candidate to be used as baseline \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) trigger in 2017, where the instantaneous luminosity will be too high to allow an unprescaled data-taking with the MHT chains at a reasonable threshold.

Figure 12: Acceptance of L1Topo triggers for di-tau events relative to the acceptance of similar triggers for two taus and a jet without L1Topo. The relative acceptance is shown as a function of the \(\Delta R(\tau,\tau)\) between the two taus and the transverse momentum of the leading jet as reconstructed offline. The L1Topo triggers require \(\Delta R(\tau,\tau)<2.9\) (left) and \(\Delta R(\tau,\tau)<2.9\) with an additional jet with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV (right).

The solid lines show the \(E_{T}\) resolution for all events, whereas the dotted lines show the \(E_{T}\) resolution for the subset of events that correspond to the first 12 bunch crossings (BCs) in each bunch train.

The updated calibration consists of multiple pieces, which together allow for improved agreement between the scale of trigger and offline jets as a function of both \(\eta\) and \(p_{\rm T}\) and thus the trigger efficiency rises much more rapidly. The trigger with an updated calibration was added for commissioning during summer 2016.

## 5 Summary

The ATLAS trigger system was successfully operated during the 2016 proton-proton data-taking period. The trigger menu allowed for the collection of a balanced data set for various physics analyses as well as for detector monitoring and calibration purposes and is summarised within this document. In 2016 several improvements to the trigger system and its algorithms were deployed for the first time and contributed to the ability to cope with the significant increase in instantaneous luminosity. Among them are improvements to the geometrical coverage of the Level-1 RPC muon detector, improved muon coincidence requirements as well as bunch-crossing position dependent energy corrections to calorimeter clusters within the online event reconstruction. The Level-1 topological trigger started operating in 2016 and is crucial for maintaining the ability of the ATLAS detector to trigger on low-momentum physics signatures.
