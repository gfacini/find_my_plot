**Primary vertex determination at low and high luminosity and its influence on the significance of the H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay mode**

**Ulrik Egede**

_Lund University, Sweden._

Information from an inner tracking detector is important for the detection of an intermediate mass Higgs particle in the H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel. By including all available information from the Inner Detector on conversions and the primary vertex position the significance of a Higgs signal is at high luminosity improved by 10%. It is shown that identifying the primary vertex position with calorimeter pointing or using the inner detector gives the same significance of the Higgs signal at high luminosity. However no gain is observed by combining the two methods. At low luminosity the significance of the H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay mode is improved by 19 % by adding information from the Inner Detector.

Introduction

The inner detector has up to now not been fully integrated in the analysis of the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay channel. The inner detector has several important influences on the channel affecting the physics potential in both positive and negative directions. The negative influence from photons converting in the inner tracking detector leading to reduced energy and directional resolution in the calorimeter is well known whereas the positive effects are so far not studied in detail.

By identifying conversions it is possible to adjust the size of the cluster for collecting energy in the calorimeter and in this way to some extent regain the energy resolution lost in the events with converted photons.

To determine the Higgs mass, the direction and the energy of the two photons have to be determined. With a \(1\sigma\) spread of the primary vertex of \(5.6\:\mathrm{cm}\) along the \(z\)-axis the directional information from just the position in the calorimeter is not good enough. The calorimeter itself can provide some information on the direction from the cluster positions in the first and second samplings of the calorimeter but a unique determination of the primary vertex would greatly improve the precision in the direction of the photons. This report will focus on the determination of the primary vertex.

## 2 Physics potential

The Higgs mass is determined from the energy of the two photons and their directions as

\[m_{\mathrm{H}}^{2} = 2E_{1}E_{2}(1-\cos\,\alpha) \tag{1}\] \[\cos\,\alpha = \cos\left(\varphi_{1}-\varphi_{2}\right)\sin\theta_{1}\sin\, \theta_{2}+\cos\,\theta_{1}\cos\,\theta_{2}, \tag{2}\]

where \(\alpha\) is the angle between the two photons and \(\theta_{i}\) the polar angle of the individual photons. The angle between the photons can also be expressed through the pseudorapidities as

\[\cos\,\alpha=\frac{\cos\left(\varphi_{1}-\varphi_{2}\right)}{\cosh\,\eta_{1} \cosh\,\eta_{2}}+\tanh\eta_{1}\tanh\eta_{2}. \tag{3}\]

From information on the primary vertex position the directions are computed as

\[\eta_{i}=\sinh^{-1}\left(\frac{z_{i}-z_{0}}{r_{i}}\right) \tag{4}\]with \((r_{i},z_{i})\) the position of the cluster in the second sampling of the calorimeter.

For all the analysis presented approximately 1000 H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events with pile-up added have been used1. The Higgs mass simulated was 100 GeV. Pile-up was added as a Poisson distribution of minimum bias events with a mean of 24/32/40 events in the silicon/pixel detectors, the TRT and the calorimeters.

Footnote 1: The 10 files on tape LT0 214 were used. Some events were however filtered out due to problems in the endcap calorimeter reconstruction.

The Higgs mass resolution as a function of the primary vertex accuracy can be seen in fig. 1. The gain in mass resolution is limited as the vertex resolution gets less than 1 cm. With better accuracy than this the Higgs mass resolution is totally dominated by the energy measurement in the calorimeter.

The main reason for improving the Higgs mass resolution is to improve the significance of a possible Higgs signal. The significance is defined as \(\mathfrak{S}=S/\sqrt{B}\) with \(S\) and \(B\) the number of signal and background events inside a given mass bin. If \(B\) instead is defined as the background density (events/GeV), \(S\) as the total signal, and the mass

assumed to be Gaussian with a resolution \(\sigma\), the significance in a bin \(m_{\rm H}\pm\delta m\) is given as

\[\mathfrak{S}=\frac{S\int_{-\delta m}^{\delta m}{\rm N}(0,\sigma)}{ \sqrt{2\delta m\,B}} \tag{5}\]

with \({\rm N}(0,\sigma)\) a Gaussian of mean 0 and width \(\sigma\). The maximum of (5) is at \(\delta m=1.4\sigma\) with the value

\[\mathfrak{S}_{\rm max}=0.70\frac{S(1-t)}{\sqrt{B\sigma}} \tag{6}\]

where \(t\) now is the fraction of events in non Gaussian tails.

From this it is clear that the optimal bin width to use is 2.8 times the mass resolution and the significance scales with the square root of the mass resolution. Non Gaussian tails in the mass resolution will to first order reduce the absolute value of the significance but not change the optimal bin size.

## 3 Methods for primary vertex determination

The primary vertex is with the parameters of the beam spot alone defined with a precision of 5.6 cm. The precision can be improved using the shower development in the calorimeter. The method is to reconstruct the barycentre of the shower in the first and second sampling of the calorimeter. The direction of the photon is found from simple pointing between the two positions.

In events with converted photons the position of the primary vertex can be identified from the reconstructed conversion.

A third method is to identify the position of the primary vertex from the charged tracks of the event underlying the \({\rm H}\to\gamma\gamma\) decay. These particles are from initial and final state radiation and share the main vertex with the Higgs particle. At low luminosity this method is quite simple since only a few other primary vertices are present in the detector but at high luminosity there will be on average 23 additional primary vertices from the pile-up events. The task is to pick up the correct primary vertex. All three vertex reconstruction methods are illustrated in fig. 2.

### Conversions

Converted photons can be divided into two groups depending on the radius (\(r_{\rm c}\)) where the conversion takes place. For late conversions with \(r_{\rm c}>40\) cm the electrons are only reconstructed in the TRT and the reconstructed conversion has no accurate directional information. For early conversions with Figure 2: An illustration of primary vertex identification in \({\rm H}\to\gamma\gamma\) events. In (a) the vertex is identified from pointing in the calorimeter, in (b) from the reconstruction of a converted phqon and in (c) from the tracks in the underlying events.

\(r_{\rm c}<40\) cm the electrons have at least 2 space points each in the silicon tracker to measure the direction of the photon.

The algorithm for reconstructing conversions is relatively simple. It is assumed that all the primary photons have zero impact parameter, thus ignoring the beam spread of 15 \(\mu\)m in the transverse plane. A conversion is fully defined with the parameter set

\[{\cal C} = (r_{\rm c},z_{\rm c},\varphi_{\rm c},T,C_{\rm l},C_{\rm 2}) \tag{7}\]

where the first three parameters is the conversion point in polar coordinates, \(T\) is the slope \(\frac{{\rm d}z}{{\rm d}r}\) of the photon and \(C_{\rm i}\) the curvature of the two electrons signed with the charge. From this set of parameters the parameters \({\cal P}_{i}^{\rm C}\) of the electrons making up the conversion are uniquely given in the standard perigee representation as

\[d_{\rm i} = \frac{\sqrt{1+r_{\rm c}^{2}C_{\rm i}^{2}}-1}{C_{\rm i}} \tag{8}\] \[\varphi_{\rm i} = \varphi_{\rm c}-\sin^{-1}\left(a_{\rm i}r_{\rm c}+\frac{b_{\rm i}} {r_{\rm c}}\right)\] (9) \[z_{\rm i} = z_{\rm c}-\frac{2T}{C_{\rm i}}\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{C_{\rm i} \sqrt{\frac{r_{\rm c}^{2}-d_{\rm i}^{2}}{1+C_{\rm i}\,d_{\rm i}}}}{2}\right)\] (10) \[T_{\rm i} = T\] (11) \[C_{\rm i} = C_{\rm i} \tag{12}\]

when

\[a_{\rm i} = \frac{C_{\rm i}}{2(1+C_{\rm i}\,d_{\rm i})} \tag{13}\] \[b_{\rm i} = d_{\rm i}(1-a_{\rm i}d_{\rm i}). \tag{14}\]

The reconstructed conversion is obtained as a \(\chi^{2}\) fit to the perigee parameters \({\cal P}_{i}^{\rm PR}\) from the pattern recognition. The \(\chi^{2}\) is

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i=1}^{2}\left({\cal P}_{i}^{\rm PR}-{\cal P}_{i}^{\rm C}\right) \mbox{W}_{i}\left({\cal P}_{i}^{\rm PR}-{\cal P}_{i}^{\rm C}\right)^{\top} \tag{15}\]

which is minimised by varying the conversion parameters \({\cal C}\) as defined in (7). \(\mbox{W}_{i}\) is the inverse error matrix of the track with parameters \({\cal P}_{i}^{\rm PR}\). It is assumed that the individual track fits from the pattern recognition are uncorrelated. The minimisation is done with the minuit[1] package and is a minimisation having 10 variables and 6 parameters.

Since a minuit fit is quite time consuming a preselection is made on the basis of the distance between the 2 tracks in the transverse plane. The distance is computed at the radius of the hit closest to the primary vertex on the two tracks. The time consumed for conversion finding is at high luminosity in any case much lower than the time spent in the pattern recognition.

With the detector design as presented in the Inner Detector TDR[2] 10.6% of all photons with 50 GeV in transverse momenta convert below a radius of 40 cm. This fraction varies slowly with the photon momenta. For \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events this leads to at least one conversion in 20% of the events. Since the conversion electrons curve in the magnetic field, the cluster width in the \(r\varphi\) direction is larger for converted photons leading to a worse energy resolution. To some extent this loss can be regained by an improved resolution in the primary vertex from converted photons.

Conversions are searched for in roads \((\Delta\eta,\Delta\varphi)=(0.5,0.5)\) around the identified clusters in the calorimeter and accepted if they have a reconstructed momenta above 20 GeV. The cut on momenta effectively kills all background from conversions arising from photons in \(\pi^{0}\) decays of the pile-up. The position of the main vertex is calculated as

\[z_{0}=z_{\mathrm{c}}-r_{c}T_{c}. \tag{16}\]

For the conversions in the Higgs events with pile-up there is a reconstruction efficiency of \(55\%\pm 3\%\) for early conversions. The

Figure 3: The efficiency for reconstructing early conversion as a function of conversion radii.

of conversion radii can be seen in fig. 3. The low efficiency is mainly from conversion radii close to 40 cm and can in a general conversion search be found with much larger efficiency. Unfortunately this will not retain the \(z\) information of the tracks and is thus of no value for the Higgs vertex identification. Plots of the resolution in the different variables can be found in fig. 4. This is the first performance plots of conversions found in actual Higgs events with pile-up included. Figures with much better statistics and for conversions reconstructed in the full Inner Detector can be found in[2]. However, they have been made for 50 GeV single photons with and without pile-up and not H \(\to\gamma\gamma\) events.

### Global track reconstruction

Several variables can be taken into account when trying to identify the \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) vertex through reconstruction of all charged tracks in the event. The general idea is that the Higgs vertex is more energetic than the minimum bias vertices. As a first step in this analysis a simple toy Monte Carlo was made to identify appropriate measures to distinguish the primary vertices. No inefficiencies were included at this stage, and only tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) were selected. Possible parameters for identifying the correct vertex are:

**Track count**: Counting the number of charged tracks above a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cutoff of the order of 0.5 to 4.0 GeV reveal an excess of high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) tracks for the Higgs events.
**Maximal \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)**: The primary vertex is selected as the vertex with the track of highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). A slightly better variable is the scalar sum of the 3 particles with highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) from a vertex.
**Thrust**: From the reconstructed transverse \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the Higgs a transverse thrust with respect to the Higgs axis can be defined as

\[T=-\frac{\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}^{i}\cos\theta_{i}}{\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}^{i}} \tag{17}\]

where the sum is over all tracks from a specific primary vertex and \(\theta\) the angle in the transverse plane to the reconstructed Higgs.
**\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)**: **balance**: The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance for charged particles along the reconstructed Higgs direction is defined as

\[p_{\mathrm{T}}^{B}=-\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}^{i}\cos\theta_{i} \tag{18}\]

with the same definitions as in (17). The value of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{B}\) can either be used alone or compared to the reconstructed \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the Higgs in the event.

Integrated probability distributions for several of the variables mentioned above can be seen in fig. 5. Distributions shown are for single Higgs events and minimum bias events, the distributions will overlap much more when a mean 23 background distributions are compared to the Higgs distribution.

Looking at fig. 1 it is seen that the important point is not the resolution of the primary vertex but instead to pick up the correct vertex among the in mean 24 vertices along the \(z\) axis. For this reason a scanning algorithm was constructed which in steps of 250 \(\mu\)m goes through the possible primaryFigure 5: The probability to exceed a given threshold for tracks from the primary vertex of \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) and minimum bias events. The probability is shown for the number of tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.5\) GeV and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1.0\) GeV, the maximal \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) from the vertex and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) balance along the axis of the Higgs event.

vertex positions and at each point tries to decide if the position can contain the Higgs vertex. The method gives a vertex resolution of 120 \(\mu\)m which is more than adequate for the Higgs mass resolution. It should be pointed out that no attempt is made to reconstruct all the primary vertices in the event.

The currently implemented algorithm makes use of the **Maximal \(p_{\rm T}\)** and either the **Track count** or \(p_{\rm T}\)**balance** to identify the vertex. As a first step the data are analysed and two 2-dimensional histograms are filled. One for the value of the variables at the correct Higgs vertex position and the other for all remaining vertex positions. In each bin of the histogram the relative significance of the Higgs vertex can then be computed as

\[\mathfrak{S}^{\rm rel}_{ij}=\frac{\rm H_{\it j}}{\sqrt{\rm B_{\it j}}} \tag{19}\]

where \(i\) and \(j\) are the indices in the Higgs histogram H and background vertex histogram B.

During the analysis all vertex positions are stepped through for each event and the relative significance calculated from (19). If the significance is above a lower cutoff value the vertex position enters into the Higgs mass fit. Using the variables **Maximal \(p_{\rm T}\)** and \(p_{\rm T}\)**balance** gives a significance plot for the vertices as shown in fig. 7. The resolution of the primary vertex for events where one or more primary vertices were identified. 80% of the weight is in the central peak. The spikes in the sides are from under and overflow.

The method will for each event give zero, one or more candidates for the Higgs vertex. In case of zero candidates the vertex information is taken from the beam spot or the calorimeter. For one vertex candidate the Higgs mass is simply calculated using this position. For more than one vertex the Higgs mass is calculated with a weight for each vertex corresponding to the significance from (19). The total weight from all the accepted vertices in a single event is normalised to 1. This method of weighting, in case of several vertex candidates in one event, is better than simply choosing the vertex with the highest weight. An example of the distribution of the weight in the events with at least one vertex selected can be seen in fig. 7.

The main problem of the algorithm are events where a wrong primary vertex is selected with a large weight since this contributes to the tails in the Higgs mass distribution while events with no vertices selected at least makes no harm in comparison with using the calorimeter or beam spot information only. A high value for the cutoff on the significance will give many events with no vertices found while a low value of the cutoff will return the Higgs vertex in nearly every event but also many wrong vertex positions with similar or higher weights. Both effects can be seen in fig. 8.

At high luminosity and without using the calorimeter pointing the optimal point for the Higgs signal significance is for a very high cutoff where a Higgs vertex candidate is found in 44% of the events and only 30% of the weight enters into the correct Higgs vertex (or 68% of the weight in the events where

Figure 8: The fraction of the total weight that enters into the correct Higgs vertex as a function of the cutoff used for selecting vertex candidates. In (b) the fraction of events with no vertex selected as a function of the cutoff.

a vertex is selected at all). When the cutoff for selecting vertices is changed both the fraction of events where no events is selected at all and the weight entering into the correct Higgs vertex changes.

The optimisation of the cutoff can be seen in fig. 9 for the two situations where either the calorimeter pointing or just the beam spot position is used in the events where no vertex is selected. As expected the global tracking is much more important for the case where the calorimeter pointing is not used. The global tracking has its best performance where the relative significance reaches its maximum.

At low luminosity with much fewer background vertices a much larger efficiency for picking the correct vertex is of course possible.

## 4 Influence on Higgs mass resolution and significance

With the different methods for finding the primary vertex developed it is easy to compare the power of them. The significance of a Higgs signal is determined by the mass resolution and the amount of signal events outside a \(\pm 1.4\sigma\) window as derived in section 2.

As a reference point results will be used with vertex information taken only from the position of the beam envelope. This is the worst case scenario with a mass resolution of 1.66 GeV and with 75% of the events inside the signal peak. The last number should be compared to the 84% expected from a perfect Gaussian. If not otherwise quoted events with one or both photons in a crack of the calorimeter are excluded from the analysis. The accepted regions in \(\eta\) for reconstructed clusters are \(0.08<|\eta|<1.37\) and \(1.52<|\eta|<2.45\).

In table 1 the results are summarised for a large set of different conditions at high luminosity:

**Beam constraint**: A primary vertex position of (0,0,0) used in all positions. Conversions not identified.
**Calorimeter**: The pointing from the calorimeter used but conversions are not identified.
**Calorimeter & Conversions**: Same as above but identified conversions are used both for pointing and for a separate energy calibration.
**Calorimeter & Global**: Global track reconstruction used in addition to the calorimeter pointing.

Figure 9: Effect of changing the cutoff used to select the correct candidates for the \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) vertex. In (a) the Higgs mass resolution is shown as a function of the weight in the correct Higgs vertex and in (b) the mass resolution as a function of the fraction of events with no selected vertex from the global tracking. In (c) an (d) the relative significance of the Higgs signal is plotted instead. The optimal cutoff to use is where the significance reaches its maximum. In each figure is shown results where the calorimeter pointing is used in the events with no selected vertex (solid line) and where only the beam spot position is used (dashed line).

**Calo, Conv & Global** All information available used for both energy calibration and primary vertex determination.
**Beam & Conversions**: The beam constraint and information from conversions used. No pointing from the calorimeter.
**Beam & Global**: The beam constraint and global track reconstruction used. Conversions not identified.
**Beam, Conv & Global**: All information except the pointing from the calorimeter used.
**True vertex**: The true vertex position used.
**True vertex & Conversions**: The true vertex information used and identified conversions used for separate energy calibration.

In the high luminosity case the calorimeter performance alone can be compared to the situation with adding information from the inner detector. The main improvement is from identifying conversions such that an independent energy calibration can be done for converted and non-converted photons in the barrel part of the calorimeter. It is seen that the best performance achievable using only the global track reconstruction (row **Beam, Conv & Global**) and using only the calorimeter (row **Calorimeter & Conversions**)

for pointing are nearly equal. However combining the 2 methods (row **Calo, Conv & Global**) gives no further improvement which was more or less expected from fig. 1. Some selected mass distributions in the high luminosity case can be found in fig. 10.

That the same significance of the Higgs signal is achievable at high luminosity with the calorimeter pointing having a worse resolution than expected, confirms the robustness of the ATLAS detector for finding a Higgs particle in the \(\,{\rm H}\to\gamma\gamma\) decay channel.

Figure 10: Distribution of the reconstructed Higgs mass at high luminosity for the options **Beam constraint** (a), **Calorimeter** (b), **Calorimeter & Conversions** (c) and **Beam, Conv & Global** (d). The values of the fits can be found in table 1.

In the CMS technical proposal[3] the identification of the primary vertex was done on the basis of a track counting method. The value contributed to the mass resolution compared to the situation with a perfect vertex resolution was estimated with different numbers of pile-up events added. However only up-to 20 minimum bias events were added and the Poisson distribution of the number of minimum bias events to add not taken into account. Extrapolating the curve to 24 minimum bias events gives a 0.75 GeV contribution to the mass resolution. In the ATLAS analysis the same number can be reached by subtracting the resolutions obtained for **Beam & Conversions** and **Beam, Conv & Global** from table 1 in quadrature giving 0.76 GeV.

At low luminosity the situation is quite different. The results in table 2 are obtained with only the Higgs event in the simulation. For the purpose here the situation is quite close to the low luminosity case where only a few overlapping events are expected in the silicon and pixel detectors. The effect of adding pointing from the global tracking now adds 7% to the significance compared to using only the calorimeter for pointing and 16% when using only the beam spot constraint. From this it is seen that the global tracking is essential in the search for \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decays at low luminosity. As for the high luminosity case some selected mass distribution can be found in fig. 11.

Conclusion

A method for identifying the \(z\) position of the primary vertex of H \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events at high luminosity has been developed.

Identified conversion give a primary vertex resolution of 400 \(\mu\)m in 11% of the events and at the same time makes it possible to use different energy calibrations in the calorimeter for converted and non-converted photons.

The primary vertex can also be identified by reconstructing all tracks in the inner detector and selecting the correct Higgs vertex from the number of tracks and their momenta. The method is based on a weighting algorithm and places, at high luminosity, for 44% of the events 68% of the weight in a central peak with a vertex resolution of 200 \(\mu\)m.

It was shown that the inclusion of tracking information contributes to the significance of a Higgs signal through the separate energy calibration in the calorimeter for converted photons. However with a reduced precision in the pointing from the calorimeter the performance can be retained using the global track reconstruction to find the primary vertex. In both cases the significance improves by around 10% compared to the situation with no pointing information at all.

A small improvement in the identification of the primary vertex will come from raising the amount of identified conversions with information on the \(z\)-coordinate. This is a major effort since it requires substantial changes to the existing pattern recognition algorithms.

It is most likely possible to find better parameters for the selection of the primary vertex from the global tracking. The large amount of information from the tracks and the weak signatures makes it a difficult task to do a systematic search for better parameters. A neural network could be used for the selection but to get the large data samples required for training and testing will be a problem.

At low luminosity it was shown that the inclusion of vertex information from global tracking gives a large improvement in the significance of the Higgs signal.

The absolute values of the significance for a Higgs signal in the different luminosity situations has uncertainties which are much higher than the differences quoted here[4]. The current estimates are from the analysis made for the Technical Proposal[5] giving a significance for a 100 GeV Standard Model Higgs of 2.4 for 3 years running at low luminosity (\(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)) and 3.9 for 1 year at high luminosity (\(10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)). That the absolute values are uncertain mostly due to the uncertainties in the background cross section and rejection does not prevent a detailed analysis as presented here on the relative improvement in the significance from using the inner detector to improve the signal resolution.

It is obvious that the results presented using the structure of the underlying event has uncertainties following from the uncertainties in the underlying event structure of the \(\mathrm{H}\to\gamma\gamma\) events and the minimum bias events. All simulations have been made with the standard ATLAS settings of pythia and no attempt has been made yet to estimate the size of the uncertainties in the vertex selection from the theoretical uncertainty in event structures.
