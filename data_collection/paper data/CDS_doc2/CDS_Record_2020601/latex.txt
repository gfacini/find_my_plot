# Study of correlation of PDF uncertainty in single top and top pair production at the LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The incomplete knowledge of parton distribution functions is an important source of systematic uncertainty for top-quark measurements, including top-quark pair and single top-quark production cross sections, as well as for analyses that have a large background from these processes. The correlation of the parton-distribution-function uncertainty is studied for top-quark pair production and single top-quark production in association with a \(W\) boson, in final states with two reconstructed leptons. Four types of correlation are studied: between total production cross-sections, between cross-section and acceptance correction, between the two processes for common selection requirements, and between different jet multiplicity requirements. The uncertainty correlation is evaluated for several sets of parton distribution functions using simulated samples of top-quark pair and single top-quark events.

## 1 Introduction

Correlations of the uncertainty of parton distribution functions (PDF) are crucial in LHC analyses that involve both top quark pair and single top-quark production [1; 2]. The correlation of the PDF uncertainty needs to be accounted for in measurements where top-quark production is an important background, and multiple analysis regions are combined in a statistical analysis [3; 4]. Uncertainty correlation is also relevant when comparing experimental cross section measurements to theoretical predictions and for the extraction of the CKM matrix element \(|V_{tb}|\) from the ratio of measured and theoretical single top cross sections [2; 5; 6; 7].

Correlation of the PDF uncertainty is accounted for when computing acceptance corrections, which are defined as the ratio of the number of reconstructed events which fulfill a given set of kinematic requirements with respect to the total number of simulated events in the full phase space, including generator event weights. However, accounting for the exact correlation of the PDF uncertainty is often not practical in the final statistical analysis step of a cross-section measurement or limit setting analysis due to the large number of individual PDF variations to consider [8; 9]. It is also not necessary to consider all the PDF variations for the estimation of the correlation of the PDF uncertainties as long as such uncertainties can be treated either as correlated or as uncorrelated with good approximation.

Correlation of the PDF uncertainty is studied for top-quark pair (\(t\bar{t}\)) and single top-quark production in association with a \(W\) boson (\(Wt\)). \(Wt\) production results in two \(W\) bosons and one \(b\) quark from the top quark decay. The final state focused on here contains two leptons and large missing transverse energy from the decay of the \(W\) bosons, as well as one jet (the single top-quark signature) or two jets (the top-quark pair signature) [2].

Both \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Wt\) events are generated using MC@NLO v4.06 [10; 11] interfaced to HERWIG v6.520 [12] with JIMMY v4.31 [13] for the modelling of the underlying event, and with the CT10 PDF set [14]. The top-quark mass is set to 172.5 GeV in the event generation, and a diagram-removal scheme is used in the \(Wt\) generation to remove top-quark pair overlap [15]. The generation of \(Wt\) events is performed with the five-flavour scheme, in which \(b\)-quarks are included in the initial state. Generated events are passed through the full simulation of the ATLAS detector [16], based on GEANT4 [17], and reconstructed using the same procedure as for collision data. Both samples are simulated with pile-up.

The event selection employs the full ATLAS reconstruction [18]. Events are selected if they contain exactly two high-transverse momentum leptons with opposite charge (electron or muon with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV), and missing transverse energy of at least 20 GeV. Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [19] with a radius parameter \(R=0.4\). At least one jet with transverse momentum larger than 25 GeV is required. The acceptance correction studies impose additional inclusive or exclusive jet multiplicity requirements. Events with two electrons or two muons are required to have a dilepton invariant mass smaller than 81 GeV or larger than 101 GeV to reduce the background from Drell-Yan events.

The NLO PDF sets CT10 [14], MMHT2014 [20] and NNPDF3.0 [21] are considered. The PDF4LHC prescription [8; 9] is followed to determine the center for each distribution and the PDF sets corresponding to a value of the strong-coupling constant of \(\alpha_{s}=0.118\) at the \(Z\) boson mass are used. The NLO PDF sets CTEQ6.6 [22], MSTW2008 [23], NNPDF2.3 [24] and HERAPDF1.5 [25] are used for additional comparisons. For the MSTW2008 PDF set, the uncertainty due to the \(b\) quark mass is also evaluated, corresponding to a mass variation of 0.25 GeV. The uncertainty of the CT10, MMHT2014, CTEQ6.6 and MSTW2008 PDF sets is estimated with hessian eigenvector variations, whereas the uncertainty of NNPDF sets is estimated with MC replicas. For the HERAPDF1.5 PDF set, the hessian eigenvector,model and parametrisation uncertainties are considered. The PDF set are accessed through LHAPDF v6.1.5 [26].

The cross-sections and acceptance corrections for various selection criteria are obtained by reweighting the samples generated with the CT10 PDF set for each of the different PDF eigenvectors (for CT10, MMHT2014, CTEQ6.6, MSTW2008 and HERAPDF1.5) and for different replicas (for NNPDF). The reweighting is a function of Bjorken \(x\) and flavour of the two incoming partons and the factorisation scale. The CT10 and CTEQ6.6 uncertainties are scaled from the 90% CL interval to the 68% CL interval [9] by dividing the uncertainties by a factor of 1.645. For NNPDF, the correlation coefficient and a 1\(\sigma\) elliptical contour is obtained from 100 replicas. Only the change relative to the average of the CT10, MMHT and NNPDF3.0 sets is computed [8; 9] since this provides a clear comparison of different PDF sets and their correlations. The correlation coefficient is computed from the eigenvectors or replicas. For a given PDF set, the correlation coefficient \(\rho\) is given by

\[\rho=\frac{\sum_{i}(x_{i}-\overline{x})(y_{i}-\overline{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i}(x_ {i}-\overline{x})^{2}}\sqrt{\sum_{i}(y_{i}-\overline{y})^{2}}}\,, \tag{1}\]

where the index \(i\) runs over all of the PDF variations of a given PDF set, \(x_{i}\) and \(y_{i}\) are the two sets of cross-sections or acceptance corrections, and \(\bar{x}\) (\(\bar{y}\)) is the mean of the \(x_{i}\) (\(y_{i}\)) values.

Each figure of this note shows the CT10 eigenvectors as blue circles, the MMHT2014 eigenvectors as red squares, and NNPDF as green ellipses. The statistical uncertainty on the PDF variations due to simulation statistics is less than 0.05% due to the reweighting procedure.

## 2 Correlation of cross-sections

The correlation of the inclusive cross-sections evaluated with MC@NLO+Herwig between \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Wt\) is discussed in this section. The variations of the total cross-sections for the various PDF eigenvectors (for CT10 and MMHT2014) and for the various replicas (for NNPDF) are shown in Fig. 1(a). The total cross-section shows a strong correlation between \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Wt\) production. This is expected for the total cross-section since both processes are dominated by gluon-initiated production. The central values of the various PDF sets are also separated from each other, though the central values show a similar correlation trend as the individual uncertainties. The correlation is similarly high for the other PDF sets (CTEQ6.6, MSTW2008, HERAPDF1.5, NNPDF2.3), as shown in Fig. 1(b). HERAPDF1.5 gives a lower cross section for \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Wt\) due to its lower gluon content. For the same reason, the ABM11 PDF set [27] (not shown) gives a lower \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section than HERAPDF1.5 and a similar \(Wt\) cross-section.

Figure 1: Impact of PDF uncertainty eigenvectors and replicas on the cross-section for top pair production vs that for single-top-quark associated production computed with MC@NLO. The correlation coefficient in (a) is 0.98 for CT10, 0.97 for MMHT2014 and 0.97 for NNPDF3.0. The correlation coefficient in (b) is 0.98 for CTEQ6.6, 0.98 for MSTW2008, 0.93 for HERAPDF1.5, and 0.98 for NNPDF2.3.

## 3 Correlation of cross-section and acceptance correction

The correlation of the cross-section with the acceptance correction is shown in Fig. 2. The correlation for the \(Wt\) sample and a \(Wt\)-like selection, requiring exactly one jet in addition to the requirements from Section 1, is shown in Fig. 2(a). The individual PDF sets show only a small amount of correlation. Moreover, each PDF set is centered in a different region of this two-dimensional distribution, with CT10 and MMHT2014 agreeing in cross section but not in acceptance correction, and MMHT2014 and NNPDF3.0 agreeing in acceptance correction but not in cross-section.

The correlation for the \(t\bar{t}\) sample and a \(t\bar{t}\)-like selection, requiring at least two jets in addition to the requirements from Section 1, is shown in Fig. 2(b). Similar to \(Wt\), the individual PDF sets have only a small amount of correlation between cross-section and acceptance correction. And again, the three different PDF sets are centered in different regions, mostly as a result of acceptance correction differences.

Figure 3 shows the same correlation between cross section and acceptance correction as Fig. 2, but for the PDF sets CTEQ6.6, MSTW2008, HERAPDF1.5 and NNPDF2.3. Figures 2 and 3 have a common scale, thus the horizontal and vertical axis values can be compared with each other. The different PDF sets are centered in different regions in Fig. 3, though, not surprisingly, each of the CTEQ, MSTW, NNPDF sets overlaps with their respective counterparts from Fig. 2. The HERAPDF1.5 PDF set is not only centered in a different region, it also shows a positive correlation between cross-section and acceptance correction, whereas all other PDFs have either zero or negative correlation. The large positive correlation is mainly due to one of the PDF parametrisation variations, which corresponds to a lower starting scale of the PDF parametrisation of 1.5 \(\text{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}^{2}\) and a different functional form of the gluon PDF.

Figure 2: Impact of PDF uncertainty eigenvectors and replicas on the cross-section and the acceptance correction for (a) \(Wt\) production and (b) top pair production. Events are selected with (a) exactly one jet and (b) at least two jets. For \(Wt\), the correlation coefficient is -0.40 for CT10, -0.32 for MMHT2014 and -0.68 for NNPDF3.0. For \(t\bar{t}\), the correlation coefficient is -0.36 for CT10, -0.02 for MMHT2014 and -0.72 for NNPDF3.0.

Figure 3: Same as Fig. 2 for the CTEQ6.6, MSTW2008, HERAPDF1.5 and NNPDF2.3 PDF sets. For \(Wt\), the correlation coefficient is -0.60 for CTEQ6.6, -0.51 for MSTW2008, 0.85 for HERAPDF1.5 and -0.50 for NNPDF2.3. For \(t\bar{t}\), the correlation coefficient is -0.55 for CTEQ6.6, -0.29 for MSTW2008, 0.88 for HERAPDF1.5, and -0.29 for NNPDF2.3.

## 4 Correlation of acceptance corrections

The variations of the acceptance corrections for at least one jet, exactly one jet and at least two jets selection criteria for the different PDF eigenvectors (for CT10 and MMHT2014) and for the different replicas (for NNPDF3.0) are shown in Fig. 4.

The correlation of the PDF uncertainty is large between \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Wt\) for the comparatively inclusive event selection of at least one jet shown in Fig. 4 and for the \(t\overline{t}\)-like selection of at least two jets shown in Fig. 4. For the \(Wt\)-like selection of exactly one jet shown in Fig. 4, the correlation is weaker.

The correlation of the acceptance correction between different jet multiplicity requirements is shown in Fig. 5, comparing a \(Wt\)-like selection (vertical axis) to a \(t\overline{t}\)-like selection (horizontal axis). For \(Wt\)

Figure 4: Impact of PDF uncertainty eigenvectors and replicas on the acceptance correction for top pair production vs that for single-top-quark associated production for (a) \(\geq\) 1-jet, (b) \(=\) 1-jet and (c) \(\geq\) 2-jets events. The correlation coefficient for \(\geq\) 1-jet events is 0.98 for CT10, 0.98 for MMHT2014 and 0.98 for NNPDF3.0. The correlation coefficient for \(=\) 1-jet events is 0.04 for CT10, -0.01 for MMHT2014 and 0.19 for NNPDF3.0. The correlation coefficient for \(\geq\) 2-jets events is 0.96 for CT10, 0.85 for MMHT2014 and 0.96 for NNPDF3.0.

events (Fig. 5(a)), there is strong correlation between the different jet multiplicity requirements, while the correlation is weaker for top-quark pair events (Fig. 5(b)). This difference in correlation is a result of the phase space selection: \(Wt\) events have one jet from the top-quark decay, and additional jets are produced by QCD radiation, while \(t\bar{t}\) events have two jets from the top-quark decay. Thus, one of the jets in \(t\bar{t}\) events has to fail cuts in order to pass the one-jet selection.

The same correlation for the additional PDF sets is shown in Fig. 6. The same conclusions as for Fig. 4 can be drawn, except that HERAPDF1.5 has a negative correlation coefficient for \(t\bar{t}\) events in Fig. 6(b). This is mainly due to one of the PDF parametrisation variations, which corresponds to a lower starting scale of the PDF parametrisation of 1.5 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}^{2}\) and a different functional form of the gluon PDF.

The \(t\bar{t}\)-equivalent of the exactly one-jet vs at least two-jets selection for \(Wt\) is to compare the acceptance correction for exactly two jets and at least three jets requirements. The correlation for these selection requirements is shown in Fig. 7. Similar to the 1-jet vs 2-jets case for \(Wt\), the correlation is large, though not as large. Moreover, the MMHT2014 and MSTW2008 PDF sets show negligible correlation while the other PDF sets have reasonably large positive correlation.

The PDF uncertainty due to varying the \(b\) quark mass by 0.25 GeV is evaluated for MSTW2008. For \(Wt\), this uncertainty is less than a quarter of the eigenvector uncertainty shown in Figs. 3(a) and 6(a). For \(t\bar{t}\), there is no dependence on the \(b\) quark mass in the PDF uncertainty.

Figure 5: Impact of PDF uncertainty eigenvectors and replicas on the acceptance correction for exclusive 1-jet and inclusive 2-jets events for (a) \(Wt\) single-top-quark and (b) top-quark pair production. The correlation coefficient for \(Wt\) is 0.90 for CT10, 0.67 for MMHT2014 and 0.92 for NNPDF3.0. The correlation coefficient for \(t\bar{t}\) is -0.03 for CT10, -0.26 for MMHT2014 and 0.14 for NNPDF3.0.

Figure 6: Same as Fig. 5 for the for the CTEQ6.6, MSTW2008, HERAPDF1.5 and NNPDF2.3 PDF sets. For \(Wt\), the correlation coefficient is 0.88 for CTEQ6.6, 0.73 for MSTW2008, 0.87 for HERAPDF1.5 and 0.86 for NNPDF2.3. For \(t\bar{t}\), the correlation coefficient is 0.05 for CTEQ6.6, -0.06 for MSTW2008, -0.97 for HERAPDF1.5, and -0.05 for NNPDF2.3.

Figure 7: Impact of PDF uncertainty eigenvectors and replicas on the acceptance correction for exclusive 2-jets and inclusive 3-jets events for top-quark pair production. The correlation coefficient in (a) is 0.79 for CT10, -0.11 for MMHT2014 and 0.67 for NNPDF3.0. The correlation coefficient in (b) is 0.80 for CTEQ6.6, -0.04 for MSTW2008, 0.80 for HERAPDF1.5 and 0.60 for NNPDF2.3.

## 5 Conclusions

Correlation of the PDF uncertainty has been evaluated with MC@NLO+Herwig simulated samples in the dilepton final state with at least one jet, comparing top quark pair and single top-quark \(Wt\) events, cross-section and acceptance correction, and different jet multiplicity requirements. The relative PDF uncertainty has been compared for two quantities at-a-time, and the correlation between them has been evaluated for the PDF sets CT10, MMHT2014, and NNPDF3.0. The correlations are generally consistent between different PDF sets, though the central values are also sometimes separated by more than the PDF uncertainty range. The observed correlations can be grouped into two categories to guide the treatment of PDF uncertainty correlations in analyses: large (correlation factor of more than 0.8 for several PDF sets) which means that the corresponding two samples or regions can be treated as correlated in an analysis with good approximation; or small (magnitude of the correlation factor is close to zero for several PDF sets), which means that the corresponding two samples or regions can be treated as uncorrelated in an analysis with good approximation.

* The PDF uncertainty of the MC@NLO+Herwig cross-sections PDF is correlated between top-quark pair and \(Wt\) single top-quark production.
* There is no significant correlation between the PDF uncertainty of the MC@NLO+Herwig cross-section and the PDF uncertainty of the acceptance corrections, neither for \(t\bar{t}\) nor for \(Wt\).
* The PDF uncertainty of the acceptance corrections for \(Wt\) is correlated between jet multiplicities.
* The PDF uncertainty of the acceptance corrections for \(t\bar{t}\) is correlated between jet multiplicities except for a selection of exactly one jet, where no significant correlation is observed.
* The PDF uncertainty of the acceptance corrections is correlated between \(Wt\) and \(t\bar{t}\) except for a selection of exactly one jet, where no significant correlation is observed.

Similar correlations of the PDF uncertainty are observed for the PDF sets CTEQ6.6, MSTW2008 and NNPDF2.3. The HERAPDF1.5 PDF set shows anti-correlation in the acceptance corrections that are not observed in the other PDF sets, mainly due to parametrisation uncertainty.
