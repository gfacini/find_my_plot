## 1 Introduction

### Purpose of the Document

This document collects the requirements for the Software Development Environment of ATLAS. It is intended to be read by potential users (2.2) of the Environment, by project reviewers and by evaluators and selectors of candidate tools for the Environment.

It is the product of an ATLAS Software Development Environment Working Group: Kors Bos, Doris Burckhart, Steve M. Fisher, Traudl Hansl-Kozanecka, Robert Jones, Mario Ruggier (secretary) and Arash Khodabandeh (convenor and editor). Special contributions have been made by Lassi Tuura (Implementation and Integration).

### 2 Scope of the Environment

The Software Development Environment is everything needed on the developer's desktop in order to participate in the orderly development or modification of a software product. It should be a fully integrated operational software environment [5], and not a collection of individual task-oriented tools. Elements may include but are not limited to just CASE tools, documentation and testing tools, compilers, linkers, debuggers, programming languages, class libraries and project and configuration management tools.

Although the software process as such is out of the scope of this document, its existence, definition, stability and statistical control are necessary to allow a good identification of the requirements. As Stenning says "the role of an environment is to support effective use of an effective process" [6]. The software environment is the instrumentation of the software process. As this document has been produced while the ATLAS Software Process [3][4] itself is been worked on, a revision of this document will be necessary when the latter has stabilized (and each time it is changed).

This document is limited to the functional requirements for the Software Development Environment. Other aspects, such as availability, pricing and licensing are important but should be addressed elsewhere.

The requirements expressed in this document are the needs as of today. It is expected that in two years most of the requirements will still be valid but a major revision of this document, based on the experience with the environment, is foreseen in phase with a re-assessment of the software itself. If it turns out that in some areas the requirements can not be satisfied, minor revisions in the interim period are not excluded.
