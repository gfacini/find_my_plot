###### Abstract

In this note are assessed the consequences of large, permanent service and access holes in the layout of the ATLAS muon spectrometer. The impact on global performances, such as transverse momentum resolution on individual muons and resolution on invariant mass reconstruction in a few selected physics channels with different topologies, have been investigated. The full complement of holes will accounts for a loss of 7% of events in the Higgs to four muons channel. Impacts on the geometrical acceptance of the trigger system are also discussed.

In its final configuration, the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer is required to provide room for service allowance and physical access to its inner regions, as well as to the inner detector and calorimeters. In the studies that were performed for the Muon Spectrometer Technical Design Report [1] and the Detector and Physics Performance Technical Design Report [2], a 30 cm-wide gap around \(\eta=0\) was assumed for service allowance in the large chambers, while no access space was taken into account.

Less optimistic scenarii are now envisaged : a central crack of \(\simeq\) 1 meter is considered, with exact value depending on the \(\phi\) sector, for service purposes only. In addition, an extra spacing in three sectors of the large chambers is foreseen for physical access. Furthermore, to make the endcap regions of the inner detectors and the beam pipe reachable, access elevators located in the bottom sectors at \(Z=\pm\) 6 m are proposed, resulting in \(\simeq\) 1 meter-wide non-projective permanent holes in the middle and outer chambers, and a reduced inner chamber. In the following two sections are presented the scenarii that we have studied, for the \(\eta=0\) crack and the elevator shafts.

The impact on the detector performances were assessed using a chain of FORTRAN90 programs developed by the Saclay Muon Software Group. The geometric layout corresponding to each scenario was described by a specific \(amdb\_simrec\) database [3], which is just the modified version of a reference database. As a reference, the most up-to-date database was used, which corresponds to the o.06 description of precision chambers [4]. The different databases were then handled by the AMDBSIMREC set of subroutines that feed the rest of the algorithms. The PERSINT Interactive Visualization Program was used for checking the corresponding layouts [5]. The performances on single muon resolution were analyzed using the RESOMU algorithm embedded in the muon reconstruction package MUONBOX [6, 7]. This algorithm performs an analytical evaluation of the different contribution to momentum resolution, using an important set of subroutines of MUONBOX, such as the internal geometrical description. This method was used to describe the physics performance of the muon system in the Technical Design Reports mentioned thereabove. Results are presented in section 4.

The degradation of the geometrical trigger acceptance on single muons (i.e. level 1 trigger acceptance) was evaluated using the RESOMU program. This is discussed in section 5.

The impact on performances on physics channels were determined using a toy-model of the spectrometer system, whereby each individual muon of an event has its momentum smeared using again the RESOMU algorithm. Using the smeared momenta, events characteristics, such as invariant mass, are then extracted. This method avoided the use of the complete, time-consuming, evaluation through the full simulation (LHCTOR or DICE [8]) and reconstruction (MUONBOX) sequence. In section 6 are presented the results obtained on the H\(\rightarrow\) 4\(\mu\), Z'\(\rightarrow\) 2\(\mu\), and W'\(\rightarrow\mu\nu\) channels. Effects of trigger geometrical inefficiencies are taken into account in this analysis.

In section 7 we have analyzed the effect of coupling permanent access holes in the layout to a staged endcap deployment. Conclusions are summarized in section 8.

## 2 The central crack

### Scenario 1 : services only, no access allowance

Permanent service holes are required around \(\eta=0\) for cable and cryogenics passage to the inner detectors and calorimeters. The dimension of the holes are quoted in Table 1[9]. The gap between chambers is symmetric with respect to \(Z=0\), and varies from one sector to another, and from one station to another (inner, middle, outer). The average value of the gap size is 1 m for large chambers and 35.8 cm for small chambers.

### Scenario 2 : services and access allowance

To allow for access to the inner regions of the Muon Spectrometer, it is proposed that a space of 48 cm be left unoccupied in sectors 1 and 9 of the large middle and outer stations, and of 72 cm in sector 5. This access space is distributed asymmetrically with respect to the Z=0 plane. To compensate for the effect this layout may have on the CP violation studies and minimize the associated systematics, sectors 1 and 9 would have their access gap situated on opposite side with respect to \(Z\). However, the gap in sector 5 is not compensated. A view of the resulting layout, obtained by PERSINT, is shown in Figure 1.

## 3 Access elevators

An access facility is required for reaching the beam pipe, inner detector, electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters. This should be accomplished with a \(\simeq\) 1 m-wide passage through the chambers of the bottom sector at \(Z\simeq\pm\)6 m, inside which elevators could be installed [10].

The design we have studied is based on permanent holes for the BML and BOL layers, and a reduced BIL chamber which can be slided during maintenance operations. The resulting layout is visualized in Figure 2.

In the present layout (o.06), the length of the last BIL chamber is 1096 mm. In order for it not to obstruct the elevator shaft when it is slid toward the EIL chambers, its length should be reduced to 916 mm (it has to be noted that this is the same length as the adjacent chamber). Concerning the BML layer, the 4th chamber is to be omitted (see Figure 2). The length of the 5th chamber is to be augmented from 1216 mm to 1456 mm (same as the 6th chamber). In the BOL station, the 3rd chamber should have its length reduced from 1696 mm to 800 mm. The 4th chamber should have its length reduced from 2177 mm to 1897 mm.

The design we have described corresponds to non-projective holes in the muon coverage, and will

## 4 Resolutions on single muons

### Introduction

The impact of the modifications of the layout on single muon momentum resolution is assessed through an analytical evaluation using the RESOMU algorithm embedded in the MUONBOX reconstruction program. This fast algorithm was abundantly used in previous studies [1, 2]. For a given set of values of \(p_{\tau}\), \(\eta\), \(\phi\), this program integrates along the muon trajectory, the various contributions to momentum resolution. These includes : single-wire accuracy, multiple scattering, energy-loss fluctuations and chamber misalignment. A detailed presentation of the method may be found in [1].

In this section, we present an evaluation of the global performance loss through an \(\eta/\phi\) scan of the system. We then concentrate on the effect of the elevator shaft, which can be best seen in an \(\eta\) scan at a fixed \(\phi\) value (e.g. \(270^{\circ}\)).

### Map of \(\eta/\phi\) cells

A mapping of the resolution is constructed on an \(\eta/\phi\) lattice of meshes \(\delta\eta\) and \(\delta\phi\). This corresponds to flat distributions for both \(\eta\) and \(\phi\). In Figure 3 is shown the result for \(p_{\tau}\)=100 GeV/c muons computed with the database including services, access holes, and elevators, and with a \(200\times 200\) binning. In this calculus, the resolution on \(\eta/\phi\) cells with none or not enough measurements is set to 100%.

To estimate precisely the resolution map versus the database and minimize binning effects, finer mesh sizes were utilized (\(\delta\eta=0.005\) and \(\delta\phi=1^{\circ}\)). Based on this mapping, Figure 4 shows the acceptance versus the resolution, i.e. for a given value of the resolution, the fraction of cells with resolution smaller than this value, for the reference layout, and for the same layout modified gradually with service, access, and elevator holes. The effects of each modifications with respect to the reference layout are detailed.

The loss of acceptance as a function of resolution is not constant and has a complex shape, where several regimes are observed. The loss of acceptance is maximum in all case for resolutions less than 4%. This means that the holes affects regions where the resolution is specially good.

From this plots are extracted the numbers quoted in Table 3, which give the acceptance below a given resolution for the different geometries. In Table 4 are given the same numbers when restricting the study to the barrel region (\(\eta<1.05\)). The numbers in the first column give the plateau of the acceptance. It turns out that the fraction of cells where no measurement is feasable increases from 0.6% to 1.5% because of the service holes. Rectricting that analysis to the barrel, this fraction rises from 1.4% to 3.8%. The inefficiency is thus multiplied by a factor 2.7 in the barrel.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c||} \hline \hline
**Station** & Region in \(\eta\) \\ \hline \hline
**BIL** & \(1.02<\eta<1.05\) \\ \hline
**BML** & \(0.66<\eta<0.81\) \\ \hline
**BOL** & \(0.52<\eta<0.65\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

**DATABASE** & & \(<\)**10\%** & \(<\)**5\%** \\ \hline

**o.06+srv.+acc.+elv.** & 98.3\% & 93.9\% & 78.7\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Comparison of acceptances of the different databases.

In parallel, the fraction of well-measured muons (resolution smaller than five percent), falls from 81.3 to 78.7 percent, which is a 3.2% relative loss. This relative loss reaches 7.4% in the barrel. Most of the effect is due to service holes. Central access holes and elevators are there responsible for a 0.4% and 1.1% relative losses, respectively.

Lower : relative difference with respect to the reference geometry. The full Muon system (barrel + endcap) is here considered.

### Effect of the elevator shaft

Contrary to service and access holes, which results mainly in event loss, the elevator shafts have non-trivial effects on resolution. The holes in BML and BOL stations being aligned in a non-projective way, there are a least two planes of measurement always available, making an angle-to-angle measurement possible where no sagitta measurement is feasable (see Figure 2). As a result, the impact on resolution depends strongly on muon momentum.

The effect of the elevator shaft is well featured in an \(\eta\) scan at a fixed value of \(\phi\). The resolution obtained at \(\phi=270^{\circ}\) for \(p_{\mathrm{{}_{T}}}\)=100 GeV/c muons, both in the case of the reference database and in the case of the same database modified with the central service and access holes, and elevator, is shown in Figure 5. The difference between the two histograms is also plotted.

Three main features appear in comparing the plots of Figure 5 : first, the complete loss of muons with \(\eta<0.06\), due to the central crack. Then, a degradation of 8% in resolution in the region that encompass the BOL elevator hole. Finally, another degradation in the region that corresponds to the BML elevator hole. As the lever arm between BIL and BOL is two times greater than the one between BIL and BML (see Figure 5), the resolution on the angle-to-angle measurement is two times higher in the BOL hole region.

The resolution of angle-to-angle measurements degrades as momentum increases. To assess this effect and compare the databases versus the momentum, we show in Figure 6, the resolution versus \(p_{\mathrm{{}_{T}}}\), obtained in the \(\eta\) regions associated with the BOL and BML holes (see Table 2), with the two databases. It appears that the resolution is highly degradated for \(p_{\mathrm{{}_{T}}}\)\(>100\) GeV/c.

## 5 Impact on the trigger geometrical acceptance

### Introduction

One advantage of the RESOMU algorithm lies in its ability to give prompt answers when varying input assumptions, such as the detector geometry. To evaluate the impact the changing geometries may have on trigger efficiency, it was decided to benefit from this tool by recording, for each \(\eta/\phi\) cells in which muons are propagated, the information on the trigger chambers encountered. With these informations, it is checked wether or not LOW PT or HIGH PT Level 1 coincidence conditions are fulfilled. LOW PT consists in having two layers of RPC middle chambers hit in the barrel or two layers of TGC outer chambers in the endcap; HIGH PT consists in a LOW PT and, one layer hit of RPC outer chamber in the barrel or one layer of TGC middle chamber in the endcap [11].

Keeping in mind that a barrel RPC chamber consists of two planes of strips, various coincidence conditions may be investigated, such as 3/4 and 1/2 hit planes, respectively in middle and outer stations, or 4/4 and 2/2. Also, a sensitive issue is related to the actual width of the RPC dead zone situated at their extremities along the Z-axis. RESOMU allows to take this into account and assess its consequences versus other input assumptions.

With this tool at hand, the impact of service and access holes is adressed. The case of the elevator shafts is of greater interest. Contrary to the measurement of a muon with precision chambers, which is still possible, though degradated, with two planes instead of three, the recording of muons with the trigger chambers is highly jeopardized by non-projective holes. The \(0.52\!<\!\eta\!<\!0.65\) hole forbids HIGH PT Level 1 triggers, while the \(0.66\!<\!\eta\!<\!0.81\) hole makes impossible the LOW PT coincidences, and hence the HIGH PT ones (see Figure 2). This is examined in detail in this section.

### The overlapping RPC geometry

The amdb_simrec database in its latest version contains the most up-to-date description of the barrel trigger geometry, which corresponds to the n1.2 version [12]. With respect to the m2.8 version utilizedFigure 5: Upper : resolution versus \(\eta\) for \(p_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\)=100 GeV/c muons at \(\phi=270^{\circ}\) for the reference database (o.06), and the same database modified with holes. Resolution of bins with none or not enough measurements is set to 100%. Lower : difference between the two histograms.

Figure 6: Resolution versus transverse momentum in the two \(\eta\) regions associated to the elevator holes, at \(\phi=270^{\circ}\), for the reference database (o.06) and the same database modified with holes.

in previous studies, the changes are the following : overlapping RPC geometry, introduction of special units to cover the empty space around the toroid ribs, holes for the precision chambers alignment system. A view of the current geometry of the BMS and BOS stations of a standard sector is presented in Figure 7.

The most profound modification is the overlapping RPC structure. This is motivated by the technical impossibility to build large chambers, which are therefore replaced by two associated and overlapping RPC chambers. It remains that some small standard RPC chambers are used (see for instance Figure 7). A comparison of performance between the old and the new RPC layout is given in the following.

### Effect of RPC dead zone

The inactive zone situated at the extremities of the RPC chambers along the Z-axis is responsible for a sensible loss of the Level 1 trigger geometric acceptance. This zone, occupied by a spacer which play the role of maintaining the resistive bakelite plates, is foreseen to have a width of 13 mm [13]. In order to investigate the loss in acceptance associated with this technical constraint, a map of the trigger inefficiencies (Figure 8) is constructed by an \(\eta/\phi\) scan of the barrel, with high resolution on pseudo-rapidity (\(\delta\eta\!=\!0.001\) and \(\delta\phi\!=\!1^{\circ}\)); this study is restricted to standard sectors.

The efficiencies derived from these maps are given in Table 5, for LOW PT and HIGH PT, and with or without the 13 mm inactive zone. Two coincidence requirements were studied : strict criteria (4/4 and 2/2) and loose criteria (3/4 and 1/2).

It is interesting to see how the standard RPC layout (m2.8) and the overlapping RPC layout (n1.2) compares in term of geometric acceptance, when the RPC dead zone is taken into account. In

Figure 7: New geometry of RPC chambers visualized with PERSINT. BMS and BOS stations shown.

order to decouple from the other evolutions in the database (ribs special units and alignment holes), a restricted scan is performed in the large chambers only (\(35^{\circ}\!<\phi\!<55^{\circ}\)). A dead zone of 13 mm was taken into account in this analysis. The resulting inefficiency maps are shown in Figure 9. The two sets of coincidence criteria were there studied. The overall geometrical acceptances are quoted in Table 6. The new layout is more efficient in all respects, due to the fact that the overlapping structure has a better coverage when going from one chamber to the next. A gain of 2% is obtained on HIGH PT coincidences with loose criteria.

### Impact of service and access holes on Level 1 geometric efficiency

A global map of the LVL-1 trigger geometric efficiency is constructed by scanning the entire system, i.e. \(-2.7\!<\eta\!<\!2.7\) and \(-180^{\circ}\!<\phi\!<180^{\circ}\). Maps with coarse resolution are shown in Figure 10 for the reference dataset and the same database modified with central service and access holes, and elevator shafts. They corresponds to HIGH PT requirements with loose criteria (3/4 and 1/2).

In the reference database map, one notes the local inefficiencies caused by the ATLAS feet structure in the barrel region at \(\phi\simeq-70^{\circ}\) and \(\phi\simeq-110^{\circ}\). This is associated to the poor BMF coverage. The BOG/BOH structure is apparent. In standard small sectors, toroid ribs and alignement holes are seen, as well as a coverage gap in between barrel and endcap. Finally, it has to be noted that a continuous central 30 cm-wide crack affects both the large and small sectors. For small sector, this is due to an allowance for the toroid ribs. In the endcap TGC chambers, alignment holes are visible (in this study, we use the n2 version of the TGC geometric database).

In the reference database modified with the full complement of holes, the central service holes are apparent, with their actual width varying from one sector to another. Also seen is the extra access space distributed asymmetrically around the service gap, in three sectors. The elevators are the cause of important gaps between the feet.

To estimate precisely the effect each modification of the layout implies on LVL-1 geometric efficiency, a fine resolution scan is performed, with cell size of \(\delta\eta\!=\!0.005\) and \(\delta\phi\!=\!1^{\circ}\). Numbers are given in Table 7. In this analysis, loose coincidence criteria are implemented (3/4 and 1/2), and the RPC inefficient end-zone of 13 mm taken into account. The full complement of service and access holes is responsible for a relative loss of 6% of the acceptance of the LOW PT trigger and 6.8% of the HIGH PT trigger. The non-projective elevator holes are themselves responsible for the relative loss of 1.2%

## 6 Resolutions on physics channels

### Introduction

The performances on physics channels are here determined with a toy-model of event reconstruction in the muon spectrometer, whereby each individual muon of a Monte Carlo-generated event has its momentum smeared by a value of the resolution computed by RESOMU. Using the smeared momenta, events characteristics, such as the invariant mass, are then extracted. This method allows to bypass the use of the complete, time-consuming, evaluation through the MUONBOX full reconstruction sequence.

The sample of events were generated with PYTHIA version 5.720 [14]. For each channel considered, samples of 10000 events are utilized, with the requirement that the entire set of muons has its rapidity below 2.7, which corresponds to the actual muon spectrometer coverage. For each muon with transverse momentum \(p_{{}_{\mathrm{T}}}\), the resolution is computed and used to smear \(1/p_{{}_{\mathrm{T}}}\), while no error is assumed on the \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) variables.

In the following are presented the results thus obtained on the following channels : Standard Model Higgs to four muons, Z' to two muons, and W' to a muon and a neutrino. The effect of each set of holes will be studied gradually by considering the four following geometrical database : 1) the reference database, 2) the reference database modified with service holes, 3) the reference database modified with service and central access holes, and finally 4) the reference database modified with service and central access holes, and elevators.

Effect of trigger inefficiencies are taken into account, by placing the requirement that one muon triggers the system, for an event to be accepted in the analysis. Di-muon Level-1 triggers are also considered.

### Standard Model H \(\to 4\mu\) channel

In analysing the \(\mathrm{H}\to 4\mu\) channel, only these events that have four muons reconstructed, i.e. having enough precision chamber measurements to provide either an angle-to-angle measurement or a sagitta measurement, are taken into consideration. Events that do not fulfill this requirement, necessary so that an invariant mass may be built, corresponds typically to these topologies where at least one muon encountered a hole in the detector coverage. This simple condition will be the cause of increasing acceptance loss with respect to increasing number of holes in the geometry. For an event of invariant mass \(M\), a reconstructed invariant mass \(M_{R}\) is obtained. The resolution on an event is then defined as \((M_{R}-M)/M\).

The distributions of \(M_{R}-M\) obtained with the reference database and with the same database modified with the full complement of holes, are shown in Figure 11, for an Higgs mass of 180 GeV.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c||c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{c||}{\(\eta<2.4\)} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(\eta<1.05\)} \\ \hline coincidence & LOW PT & HIGH PT & LOW PT & HIGH PT \\ \hline o.06 & 94.7\% & 94.1\% & 88.2\% & 87.0\% \\ \hline o.06+services & 93.2\% & 92.6\% & 84.7\% & 83.6\% \\ \hline o.06+serv+access & 92.8\% & 92.2\% & 83.9\% & 82.8\% \\ \hline o.06+srv+acc+elevators & 92.4\% & 91.5\% & 82.9\% & 81.1\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Clearly, the modification of the geometry results in a global depression of the Higgs mass peak, rather than a widening.

The impact on acceptance versus the resolution on invariant mass reconstruction is detailed in Figure 12. It shows the fraction of event with invariant mass reconstructed below a given value of the resolution \(R\), for the four databases. It appears that the service holes have the most important impact, resulting in an overall loss of 5.8% on the plateau of the acceptance with respect to the reference database. The loss peaks at 2% resolution on invariant mass reconstruction. The access holes causes an extra 1.2% relative loss. The elevators cause the loss of \(\simeq 0.2\%\) of the nicely reconstructed events (\(R<5\%\)). The effect of the elevators on Higgs analysis is small because the muons are generated with comparatively small transverse momenta (typically 45 GeV/c for a mass of 180 GeV). At these energies, it has been demonstrated that the effect of non-projective gap is moderated by the possiblity of angle-to-angle measurements. The total relative loss on acceptance is 7%. The inefficiency with respect to this channel is thus being multiplied by a factor \(\sim 3\).

To further evaluate the impact on resolution, a two-step iterative Gaussian fit is performed on the \(M_{R}-M\) distributions obtained with each database. The resulting value of \(\sigma\) are quoted in Table 8. A maximum 2.5% increase in width is observed. Also given are the fractions of events contained in a \(2\sigma\) window around 0. A total 7.5% loss is observed relative to the reference database. This corresponds to a relative increase of 58% of the number of tail events (events outside the \(2\sigma\) window). The number of standard deviations from 0 corresponding to the reference database analysis, and expressed relatively to the Higgs mass, is indicated in Figure 12.

Similar conclusions pertain, to the percent level, for rest masses ranging from 130 GeV to 800 GeV. Effect of central crack increases with mass, as the \(\eta\) distribution of muons gets more central.

The requirement of a single muon trigger has no incidence on the above analysis, as the probability that no muon over four hit the trigger system is close to zero. Requirement of a di-muons HIGH PT trigger reduces the overall acceptance by 0.53% in the case of the reference database and 0.72% when the full complement of holes is taken into account.

### Z' \(\to 2\mu\) channel

An analysis similar to the Higgs is made for the Z'. The acceptance versus resolution on Z' invariant mass reconstruction is shown in Figure 13, for a 1 TeV resonance. Again, service holes cause the most important loss of events (\(\gtrsim 3\%\) at plateau and reaching \(\sim 5\%\) below ten percent resolutions). Elevators have now a greater impact, as the muons generated by such an heavy resonance have typical values of transverse momentum of 500 GeV/c. For such high \(p_{\mathrm{r}}\), angle-to-angle measurements are highly degradated in the two-multilayers measurements of the elevator regions (see Figure 6). Considering the curves of the difference of acceptance versus resolution with respect to the reference database, it appears that they saturate much less rapidly than for the Higgs.

Asking for the condition that one of the two muons has made a trigger coincidence has consequences on the previous analysis, as now, the probality that no muon hit the trigger system is higher than for the Higgs to four muons events. To assess the effect of the trigger geometrical inefficiency, the acceptance versus resolution plots are shown in Figure 14, where only those events that have fulfilled the requirement of one HIGH PT coincidence are kept. Considering the reference geometry, the overall efficiency has fallen by 1.1% (Table 9). When the full complement of holes in the geometry is taken into account, this efficiency falls by 1.5%.

The results of the two-step iterative Gaussian fit are given in Table 9, with no requirement on triggering. No significant widening of the mass peak is observed. Like in the Higgs case, the mass peak is globally depressed. However, the number of tail events (events outside the \(2\sigma\) window) increases by a total 30%, relatively to the reference database. The effect of elevators is greater than in the case of the Higgs (0.50% vs 0.24%). This is understood by comparing the typical values of transverse momenta (500 GeV/c vs 45 GeV/c), for which, respectively, measurement and multiscattering dominate. Thus the absence of a third plane of measurement implied by the elevator shafts has greater impact on channels with greater momenta.

### W' \(\rightarrow\mu\nu\) channel

The potential for the discovery of a W'-type resonance with the ATLAS muon spectrometer relies on its ability to make a precise measurement of the muon produced in the decay of the boson. The sharper the reconstructed transverse momentum distribution, the greater the signal to background ratio.

We examine here how the modifications of the layout affects the resolution on the muon \(p_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\) measurement. The resolution is defined as \(R\)=(\(p_{\mbox{\tiny T${}_{\mbox{\tiny R}}$}}\)-\(p_{\mbox{\tiny T${}_{\mbox{\tiny T}}$}}\))/\(p_{\mbox{\tiny T${}_{\mbox{\tiny R}}$}}\), where \(p_{\mbox{\tiny T${}_{\mbox{\tiny R}}$}}\) is the transverse momentum smeared by the resolution. The evolution of acceptance versus resolution \(R\) is shown in Figure 15. The most important impact comes from the service gap (2 to 3 percent loss of acceptance). The elevators have a sensible effect on acceptance, especially in the low values of resolution. Plateau acceptances are given in Table 10.

The requirement of a trigger coincidence has a sensitive impact on W' acceptance, as the inefficiency of the trigger system is fully integrated. Acceptance versus resolution is shown in Figure 16 with the requirement of a HIGH PT trigger. Service holes contribute to a relative loss reaching 3.5%, while elevators contribute to \(\simeq 1.5\%\) relative loss.

The transverse momentum distribution as generated in the Monte Carlo and as reconstructed in the case of the reference database, and in the case of the same database modified by the full complement of holes, are shown in Figure 17. The evolution of the RMS of this distribution is given in Table 10.

## 7 Further considerations on the layout

In this section, we evaluate the impact of permanent access holes coupled with a staged EndCap deployment. It is important to understand what would be the consequences on the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer discovery potential of no coverage at \(|\eta|>2\).

In Figure 18 are shown the acceptance versus resolution on invariant mass reconstruction for a Higgs of rest mass 180 GeV, with and without the holes, and complementary, with and without forward coverage (\(|\eta|>2\)). Removing the forward detectors makes the acceptance saturates at 63% when holes are decoupled. Recoupling back the permanent service and access holes, the acceptance goes down to 57%, a \(\simeq 9\%\) relative loss.

In terms of discovery potential, it has been shown that above 180 GeV, a significance of \(\sim 20\sigma\) is reachable on the Higgs to four leptons channel, in three years of running at low luminosity [15]. This makes a discovery possible in even one year of run in the Higgs to four muons channel. In this context a loss of acceptance of 34%, due to no forward coverage, added to another 6% due to permanent holes, will constitute a serious handicap in the discovery race. For a lighter SM Higgs, the muon reconstruction up to the nominal rapidity coverage (\(|\eta|<2.7\)) is even more important given the low production rate.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & **plateau** & +1 HPT & RMS \\
**DATABASE** & **acceptance** & TRIGGER & (GeV/c) \\ \hline
**o.06** & 98.8\% & 89.0\% & 122 \\
**o.06+services** & 97.0\% & 86.8\% & 126 \\
**o.06+serv.+access** & 96.6\% & 86.3\% & 126 \\
**o.06+srv.+acc.+elv.** & 96.6\% & 85.2\% & 127 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Conclusions

In this study, the impact of permanent service and access holes has been assessed both for single muons with flat distributions in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\), and for benchmark physics channel with various, representative topologies. It has been shown how the modifications of the layout affect the acceptance versus the resolution on transverse momentum. For \(p_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\)=100 GeV/c muons, the acceptance for resolution less than 5% falls from 87.9% to 81.4% in the barrel region, a 7.4% relative loss. It has been shown that the main loss of acceptance is due to the service holes. Elevator accesses have less impacts on single muon resolution at \(p_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\)\(<100\) GeV/c, thanks to angle-to-angle measurements, than on higher \(p_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\).

Our study of the impact on the Level 1 trigger geometric acceptance has shown that the holes account for a \(\simeq 45\%\) increase of inefficiency in the barrel region.

The main result of this study is the effect foreseen on Higgs to four muons acceptance. It has been shown that 7% of events are lost with respect to the present layout. The inefficiency with respect to this channel is thus being multiplied by \(\sim 3\). With a 5.8% relative effect, it is the service holes which are the main responsible for this degradation.

A total relative loss of 4.4% is foreseen on the Z' to two muons channel (inefficiency multiplied by a factor 2.2). Geometrical trigger inefficiencies have minor effects on the Higgs and Z' channels. On the W' to \(\mu\nu\) channel, it makes the effect of non-projective holes such as the elevator shafts more sensible. The total relative acceptance loss is 4.3%, on which elevators contributes to 1.5%.

Finally, our study points out the danger of coupling a delayed forward deployment to large permanent access holes : ATLAS would end up with a 57% overall efficiency on the Higgs to four muons channel, a serious handicap in the discovery race.
