###### Abstract

During the 1994 combined run of the Atlas subdetector systems in the H8 test beam area, we have performed a measurement of the muon flux profile behind the beam dump. This information is required for evaluating the feasibility of parasitic runs of the Atlas muon system components in that beam line.

The absolute value of the muon halo flux along the beam line was measured, as well as the halo profile in the experimental area where the muon detectors prototypes will be installed in the next years.

## 1 Experimental setup

A schematic view of the H8 experimental area is shown in Fig 1. The experimental area is situated behind the Accordeon Calorimeter test zone and behind a 3.2 m iron beam dump. In Fig 1 it is also shown the structure needed for the tests of the Hadron Tile Calorimeter.

In order to perform the measurement, a simple scintillator telescope was set up, consisting of 4 scintillators, arranged in two sets, each including one large scintilator and one small scintillator:

* Set 1 composed of scintillator 1 (small) and scintillator 2 (large),
* Set 2 composed of scintillator 3 (small) and scintillator 4 (large).

Coincidences were formed with the discriminated signals from the scintillators and counted with scalers. In order to minimize the background, the coincidences were gated with the SPS spill.

Set 1 404 cm Set 2  <--------------------------------------------------------------------->  55 cm 52 cm  <-----> <-----> <-----> ----->beam | | | |  S1 S2 S3 S4

The conditions in which the test was performed were defined by the fact that there was a short time to set up the system and to carry out the measurement, in order to exploit the last days of SPS proton operation of the year.

The operating parameters of the four scintillators are shown in Table 1, and the geometry of the system is shown in Fig. 2.

For all the measurements described in this note, we set the origin of the coordinate axis at the position where both set 1 and set 2 are aligned along the beam at 2.84 m from ground. The X axis is parallel to the floor and perpendicular to the beam, the Y axis is perpendicular to the beam pointing upwards and the Z axis is parallel to the beam. Set 2 is moved along X and Y, with a fixed Z.

Set 1 was kept fixed throughout the measurements. The coincidence rate of S1 and S2 was used to normalize the measurements to the flux on the nominal beam line (Scaler 1 = Beam\(\times\) S1\(\times\)S2). Set 2 was moved around the area, and the coincidence rate of S3 and S4 was used for measuring the muon halo profile (Scaler 2 = Beam\(\times\)S3\(\times\)S4). A third coincidence was performed between the two large scintillators in the two sets to extract information on the angular distribution of the muon beam (Scaler 3 = Beam\(\times\)S2\(\times\)S4).

The measurements

The coincidences measured in the first two scalers can be transformed into an absolute measurement of the flux through the small scintillators averaged on the dimension of the counters, for a given proton intensity on target. The number of counts must be divided by the number of spills, by the spill duration (2.6s) and by the area of the small scintillator. This is equivalent to making the assumption that every beam particle going through the small scintillator of each set goes also through the corresponding large one i.e. the scintillating counters of the two sets are aligned with the beam.

The first measurement was performed with the beam stopper in, with the scintillators in position 0. For a proton intensity on target T4 of \(12\times 10^{11}\), the following values were measured on the scalers (averaged over 10 spills):

\begin{tabular}{l l} Scaler 1: & 28.4 counts/spill = 0.1\(Hz/cm^{2}\), \\ Scaler 2: & 12.7 counts/spill = 0.1\(Hz/cm^{2}\), \\ Scaler 3: & 14.8 counts/spill = 0.01\(Hz/cm^{2}\). \\ \end{tabular}

A full scan of the area was performed with an upstream beam of 50 GeV/c electron. The absolute measurement of the beam flux was obtained taking the values of the scalers summed over 5 good bursts and applying the conversion between counts and flux described above. The averaged number of protons on target averaged over the same 5 bursts was \(11.7\times 10^{11}\). The beam conditions during the measurement were very unstable.

\begin{tabular}{l l l} Scaler 1 & 9974/5 spills = 7.7\(Hz/cm^{2}\), \\ Scaler 2 & 7735/5 spills = 15.5\(Hz/cm^{2}\), \\ Scaler 3 & 21195/5 spills. \\ \end{tabular}

The fact that the rate per square centimetre is different for set 1 and set 2, could be explained by the fact that the beam intensity is not constant over the area covered by the small scintillators, but it has a core along the beam line smaller than the scintillators dimensions.

The results of the flux measurements in different positions are shown in Table 2. At 50 cm from the beam line the flux (measured with the Set 2) is of the order of \(2Hz/cm^{2}\) and is smoothly decreasing with the distance from the beam.

A background measurement was performed measuring the coincidences between scintillator 2 and 4 (scaler 3) positioning the set 2 at X=\(-\)300cm, Y=0cm, Z=0, that is at the same Z position of set 1. In this way we measure the double tracks plus the noise of the coincidence between scintillator 2 and 4. We obtain :

Because of the very low single counting rate of counters 2 and 4 the 37 coincidences are probably due to double tracks.

A second full scan of the area was performed with an upstream beam of 20 GeV/c \(\pi^{-}\). For a number of proton of target of \(14.1\times 10^{11}\), the normalization measurement on S1\(\times\)S2 gave 123.4 counts/spill on S2 averaged over 10 spills. In this configuration the counting of Scaler 1 and 2 were proportional to the area of the small scintillators, pointing to a flux more uniform than in the previous case. The measured rate, similar for both S1 and S2, is \(\approx 0.5Hz/cm^{2}\), that is \(\approx 15\) times lower than the previous measurement. The results are shown in Table 3.

A peculiar behaviour we observed is the very quick rise of the rate at a distance of a few metres from the beam on the negative side, that can be due either to the muon halo of some other beam line upstream in the area, or to the fact that the measurements were performed almost at the margin of the H8 beam dump.

## 3 Conclusions

With a 50 GeV/c electron beam, we measured the absolute muon flux with one \(10\times 10cm^{2}\) and one \(8\times 5cm^{2}\) scintillators centered on the beam line. The rate measured with the former was \(7.7Hz/cm^{2}\) and with the latter \(15.5Hz/cm^{2}\). The difference between the two rates is an indication that the flux is not constant on the Scintillator surfaces.

At a distance of 50 cm from the beam line the flux is of the order of \(\approx 2Hz/cm^{2}\) and is smoothly decreasing with the distance from the beam.

Similar measurements have been performed with a 20GeV/c pion beam. The measured rate is about 15 times lower, without indication of a small core in the halo.
