## 1 Introduction

The occupancies in the barrel TRD are expected to be high so that it is important to assess the reliability of these estimates. We have attempted to understand the occupancies for the barrel TRD, using GEANT simulations. We have tried to understand the reliability of the GEANT simulations. We have calculated the occupancies expected as we turn on one process at a time to check that we understand what is going on in GEANT. We also discuss the estimate of the cross-section and the models used to generate the minimum bias events. The other key parameter is the effective number of bunch crossings the straws are sensitive to but this requires more detailed work which has not yet been done.

## 2 Input Assumptions

To calculate the occupancies in any detector we first need to make an estimate of the non-single diffractive cross-section(\(\sigma_{NSD}\)) The estimate can be broken down into the following pieces

**Total Cross-Section(\(\sigma_{TOT}\))**: If we assume that \(\sigma_{TOT}\) increases like \((\ln s)^{2}\) then we get \(\sigma_{TOT}=130\) mb [1]. If we assume that as \(s\rightarrow\infty\)\(\sigma_{TOT}\rightarrow\)constant then \(\sigma_{TOT}=90\) mb [1]. Therefore a reasonable estimate for the value and its error would be \(\sigma_{TOT}=110\pm 20\) mb as proposed in ref. [1]. We note that the PDG fit gives \(\sigma_{TOT}=107\) mb[2] and a fit to the accelerator data and recent cosmic ray data up to \(\sqrt{s}=24\)TeV gives \(\sigma_{TOT}=113\) mb [3](see fig. 1)
**Elastic Cross-Section**: The ratio of elastic to total cross-section \(\frac{\sigma_{EL}}{\sigma_{TOT}}\) is a slowly varying function of energy as can be seen in fig. 2 (taken from ref. [1]). A reasonable extrapolation of this ratio gives a value of 0.26. A possible estimate of the systematic uncertainty could be given by assuming that the ratio does not increase beyond the value measured at Fermilab. This would imply a systematic error of \(\sim 0.03\).
**Single Diffractive Cross-Section**: The data for the single diffractive cross-section \(\sigma_{SD}\) show considerable scatter as can be seen in fig. 3. taken from ref. [4]. An estimate of the value at LHC can be made by assuming that the ratio \(\frac{\sigma_{SD}}{\sigma_{TOT}}\) is energy independent and equal to the value measured at \(\sqrt{s}=1.8\) TeV. This estimate gives \(\frac{\sigma_{SD}}{\sigma_{TOT}}=0.129\). A possible estimate of the systematic uncertainty could be given by assuming that the value of \(\sigma_{SD}\) does not increase with energy beyond \(\sqrt{s}=1.8\)TeV. This then implies an estimate of the systematic error on \(\frac{\sigma_{SD}}{\sigma_{TOT}}\) of 0.05.

The value of \(\sigma_{NSD}\) is given by

\[\sigma_{NSD}=(1-\frac{\sigma_{EL}}{\sigma_{TOT}})(1-\frac{\sigma_{SD}}{\sigma_{ TOT}})\sigma_{TOT} \tag{1}\]

Putting in the numbers discussed above gives a best estimate of \(\sigma_{NSD}=71\) mb. If we take as a conservative estimate of the upper limit, the \(+1\sigma\) values for all three input numbers we get \(\sigma_{NSD}=92\) mb. To calculate the number of NSD events per bunch crossing we assume that the luminosity is \(L=1.7\cdot 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) and the time between bunch crossings \(\Delta t=25\)ns. This gives a mean number of collisions per bunch crossing of \(N_{minbias}=30\). The maximum drift time in the straws is 40 ns which is longer than the time between bunch crossings. The straws are therefore sensitive to more than one bunch crossing. A naive estimate of the number of effective bunch crossings for the straws would be given by \((1+\frac{15}{25})\). This is probably an overestimate mainly because the drift velocity is not uniform over the straw. This effect is being evaluated by the TRD group and will be reported in a future note In this note we give results assuming \(N_{minbias}=40\) so the final results will be slightly different although we would not expect this to change the results by a large factor.

In order to compare results with the LoI we have used the Aachen tuning of PYTHIA to generate the pile up events. We note that this produces \(\frac{dN_{ch}}{dn}=5.9\) and \(\frac{dN_{neutral}}{dq}=7.3\) for \(|\eta|<1\). These are lower than the corresponding numbers from GENCL which are 6.45 (8.87) for charged (neutral) particles. The values of \(\frac{dN_{ch}}{dq}\) at \(\eta=0\) are 5.3 and 6.3 for PYTHIA and GENCL. An extrapolation of the data assuming a quadratic fit in \(\ln s\) gives \(\frac{dN_{ch}}{dq}=6.3\) at the LHC [5]. A linear fit which gives a much worse \(\chi^{2}\) would predict \(\frac{dN_{ch}}{dq}=4.9\) at the LHC. We conclude that GENCL gives the best estimate of charged particle multiplicities but that the systematic uncertainty could be \(\sim 25\%\). The higher value of neutrals in GENCL is based on the measured photon to charged particle multiplicites by UA5 [6]. The fact that the measured multiplicity of neutrals is greater than charged particles is presumably due to \(\eta\) decays. We will therefore also use GENCL to compute occupancies as it should give a better estimate than PYTHIA. However the only firm conclusion that can be drawn is that there are large systematic uncertainties on all these estimates. A reasonable estimate of the overall uncertainty due to all these factors is \(\sim 50\%\).

## 3 Results

We have calculated the occupancies in the TRD straws using GEANT. We have taken the straws to be 4mm diameter and be 95 cm long. A threshold of 0.3 KeV per straw was used to define a hit. The split barrel TRD was simulated. The radial extension of the inner and outer TRD was 57.5-77.5 cm and 82.5-102.5 cm. The simulations include the effects of all the material in the tracker (i.e. beam pipe, SITV and SIT). The simulations were done for 250 bunch crossings and the corresponding statistical error is of the order 1-2%. To understand what is going on we have done the calculations as we turn on physical processes in GEANT one at a time. The steps considered were:

1. All physics process turned off except dE/dx energy loss.No magnetic field.
2. as 1 above with B=2T3. as 2 above with decays of unstable particles (\(K^{0}_{s}\) etc) turned on.
4. as 3 above with secondary hadronic interactions turned on.
5. as 4 above with delta ray production turned on
6. as 5 above with photon conversions turned on
7. as 6 above with all EM processes turned on (brem, compton etc.)
8. as 7 above with the coil, preshower and calorimeter material included.
9. as 8 above but using GENCL instead of PYTHIA to generate the minimum bias events.

The results for the nine different sets of conditions are shown for six different radii of the straws. in Table 1 below.

The occupancies are so high that the rate of multiple hits are significant. In order to make it easier to compare the different sets we have converted the occupancies into an effective mean number of hits assuming Poisson statistics (i.e. \(\overline{n}=-\ln(1-o)\)) where o is the occupancy and \(\overline{n}\) is the mean number of hits. The results for this are shown in Table 2 below.

Some points to make about each run are:

1. The run corresponds to no interactions or decays and has B=0. It does cross-check with a naive estimate of occupancy based on charged particles only. This eliminates the possibility of any trivial bug in the analysis of the GEANT hit data.
2. The effect of the magnetic field is the largest effect. With a magnetic field there are two effects going in opposite directions. * charged particles with \(p_{T}<300MeV/c\) do not reach the outer radius of the tracker * intermediate \(p_{T}\) charged particles can give multiple hits (loopers) The increase in occupancy for silicon strips is less than for straws. For silicon strips we observe a cross over between the two competing effects at a radius of about 90 cm. However for the straws we see an increase in occupancy over the full radius. The reason for this is that straws are much thicker than silicon so that loopers can create many hits. Another way of seeing this is that the straws have more acceptance for loopers than thin detectors like silicon.
3. Turning on decays produces a small increase in occupancy. The effect decreases with increasing radius. Since the decay products have lower \(p_{T}\) than the charged primaries the effect of the magnetic field is more beneficial here.
4. Turning on hadronic interactions is a small effect. It is more important at large radius because the hadrons there have traversed more interaction lengths.
5. turning on delta ray production causes the dE/dx distribution to change. It now has a low tail so that the effect of the 0.3 KeV threshold reduces the number of hits by 4%.

6. turning on conversions generates a significant increase. The material present in our simulation at \(\eta=0\) varies from \(10\%X_{0}\) for the inner radius to \(20\%X_{0}\) at the outer radius. The corresponding numbers for the most forward part (i.e z=95 cm) are 19% for the inner and 27% for the outer radius. Therefore assuming that each converted photon would generate two hit straws we would naively expect an increase in the mean number of hits of 21% for the inner radius and 33% for the outer. This agrees roughly at the inner radius but the increase is smaller at large radius. This is also probably due to the fact that electrons from photon conversions have typically only a 1/4 of the \(p_{T}\) of the charged primaries and are therefore more likely to be curled up by the field.
7. The effect of turning on all EM processes is small, but there is possibly a significant decrease for the inner radius.
8. The effect of turning on the extra material of the preshower,coil and calorimeter (i.e. backsplash) increases the occupancy by about 5%.
9. the effect of using GENCL rather than PYTHIA to generate the minimum bias events increases the mean number of hits by between 20% at the inner radius and 35% at the outer radius. This is more than the 10% expected just from the increase in charged particle muplitiplicty. This is partly due to the correspondingly larger increase in neutral particle multiplicity, and also to the higher mean \(p_{T}\) of the particles produced by GENCL. As discussed above GENCL should give the best estimate for the minimum bias event parameters. The numbers in the last column of the tables should therefore give our best estimate of the occupancy assuming that the effective number of pileup events is 40.

## 4 Conclusions

We have calculated occupancies in the barrel TRD straws. We have first estimated a value of \(\sigma_{NSD}=71\) mb(instead of 60 mb used in the LoI) which gives a mean number of collisions per bunch crossing of \(N_{minbias}=30\) for \(L=1.7\cdot 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). We think that GENCL should be used rather than PYTHIA to generate the minimum bias events. The overall uncertainty on these factors is \(\sim 50\%\). The calculation of the effective number of bunch crossings requires more detailed calculations which should be done by the TRD group. For illustrative purposes we have calculated the occupancies assuming \(N_{minbias}=40\). We have calculated the occupancies as we turn on one process at a time in GEANT which has given us more confidence that we understand what GEANT is doing. We find that the two largest effects are the effect of the magnetic field and photon conversions. The uncertainties in the GEANT simulations are probably less than those in the input numbers discussed above.

Assuming \(N_{minbias}=40\) our best estimate of the occupancy in the TRD straws varies from 53% at the inner radius to 21% at the outer radius. However, allowing for the estimated 50% uncertainty in the mean number of hits, the occupancy could be as high as 67% at the inner and 30% at the outer radius. More work is needed to evaluate the effective number of bunch crossings the straws are sensitive to and this work is being performed by the TRD group.
