###### Abstract

The ATLAS and CMS discovery potential for the MSSM Higgs bosons is reviewed in this paper. The attention is focused on the direct and associated Higgs production and on the decays into Standard Model particles. After a short introduction, the most promising final states are discussed, showing that, if supersymmetry exists, its Higgs sector can be explored at LHC with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 1 Introduction

Although the Standard Model of Elementary Particles (SM) is in good agreement with all the experimental results obtained so far, its validity at very high energy scales is limited by the fine tuning problem [1]. This is one of the theoretical motivations to look for extensions of the SM. One of the most promising ways to override the SM is the introduction of supersymmetry. In the supersymmetric models, the particle spectrum is much richer than in the SM: for each fermion and boson, a supersymmetric partner with the spin differing by 1/2 is required.

In order to provide the spontaneous symmetry breaking in a supersymmetric model two scalar complex doublet have to be introduced, leading to 8 more degree of freedom, i.e., 5 new bosons: two CP-even (usually named \(h,H\)), one CP-odd (\(A\)) and two charged (\(H^{+}\),\(H^{-}\)) particles. At tree level the model depends only on two parameters (usuallychosen to be \(M_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\), the ratio between the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets). Moreover, it provides some predictions on the masses of the Higgs bosons: \(M_{h}<M_{Z},M_{A}<M_{H}\) for the neutral bosons, \(M_{W}<M_{H^{\pm}}\) for the charged ones. The radiative corrections (which depends mainly on the mixing in the stop sector, the top and stop quark masses, the Susy mass scale \(M_{SUSY}\)) modify the tree level predictions allowing (for example) a \(h\) mass up to 130 GeV. Figure 1 (left) shows the values of the various Higgs boson masses as a function of \(M_{A}\) in a maximal mixing scenario. As can be seen, \(m_{h}\) saturates at the maximum allowed value as \(M_{A}\) becomes large. At high \(M_{A}\) values, the \(A\) and \(H\) bosons are almost degenerate in mass, and so experimentally indistinguishable. This is the so called decoupling limit and the \(h\) behaves like a SM Higgs boson in this parameter region.

The couplings to SM fermions and bosons are also modified at tree level by factors that depends on \(\beta\). In particular, at high values of \(\tan\beta\), the couplings to down-type fermions are enhanced with respect to the SM, leading to enhanced branching ratios into \(b\overline{b}\) for \(A\) and \(H\), as well as to enriched \(b\overline{b}A\) and \(b\overline{b}H\) associated productions.

## 2 The MSSM Higgs bosons at LHC

Concerning the MSSM Higgs sector, the main task at LHC will be to investigate the existence of the Higgs bosons in the whole region of the \(\tan\beta\)-\(M_{A}\) plane in many supersymmetric scenarios. The results from LEP [2] exclude the existence of neutral MSSM Higgs bosons with masses lower than \(\simeq 90\) GeV and exclude almost completely the minimal mixing scenario. Therefore, the maximal mixing scenario has

been chosen as a benchmark to understand the LHC discovery potential in this sector, even if different scenarios have been investigated. In the following a maximal mixing scenario (with \(\mu=-200\) GeV and \(M_{SUSY}=1\) TeV) is assumed.

The main production channels for the neutral Higgs bosons are the gluon gluon fusion and the \(b\overline{b}\) associated production (see fig. 1 right plot), the second being more important as \(\tan\beta\) increases [3]. In the decoupling limit, the production channel for the \(h\) are almost the same as in the SM.

### The \(h\) discovery channels

The \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) channel is important in the decoupling limit, as it is in the SM. The considerations made about the SM Higgs discovery can be applied also in the MSSM case [4]. The main backgrounds in this channel are the irreducible \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum, as well as the reducible \(\gamma+jet\) and the \(jet\)\(jet\) production where one or two jets are misidentified as a photon. The segmentation of the EM calorimeter is the key point to reduce the misidentification of a \(jet\): a high rejection against high energetic neutral pions decaying in two \(\gamma\) is needed. Moreover, the mass resolution is crucial to extract the \(h\) peak over the background. Fig. 2 shows the invariant mass reconstruction of the \(\gamma\) pair for the CMS experiment with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Since the gluon fusion production cross section can be reduced in the case of maximal stop mixing and light stop quark mass, the \(Wh\) and \(t\overline{t}h\) associated production must be considered as well to restore the parameter space coverage in this case.

Figure 2: _The \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) signal for \(M_{h}=120\) GeV over the background (left) and after the background subtraction (right) in the CMS detector. The integrated luminosity is 100 fb\({}^{-1}\)._

The main decay channel for the \(h\) is \(bb\bar{b}\) over the whole mass range, as it is in the SM. The \(Wh\) and \(t\bar{t}h\) associated productions have been considered, the latter being much more promising. One of the two top quarks must decay leptonically in order to provide a \(\mu\) or electron trigger. This channel provides almost a full coverage of the parameter space with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) for both ATLAS and CMS. The region at low \(M_{A}\) and high tan \(\beta\) remains uncovered, but the \(bbh\) production is enhanced and the \(bbh\to bb\mu\mu\) channel becomes important, leading to a complete coverage of the plane over the LEP limits for the \(h\) Higgs boson with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Recent SM studies [5] have shown that the Vector Boson Fusion production channel provides some peculiar kinematic features which allow a good signal to background discrimination also in the low mass SM Higgs region. In the decoupling limit these results can be used also for the MSSM \(h\) boson, leading to an increased discovery potential.

### The \(A\) and \(H\) discovery channels

If the sparticles are not accessible, the main decay channels of the heavy neutral Higgs bosons \(A\) and \(H\) are \(\tau\tau\) and \(b\bar{b}\). In the decoupling limit the \(A\) and the \(H\) are degenerate in mass and indistinguishable from the experimental point of view, so their signals have to be summed up.

The most promising channel over a wide mass range (up to 800 GeV) is \(H/A\to\tau\tau\). All the final states (lepton-lepton, lepton-hadrons, hadron-hadrons) have been investigated.

The semileptonic and fully hadronic channels provide the widest discovery mass range.

In the semileptonic channel [6], the LVL1 trigger is provided by the lepton. The \(\tau\) jets are identified requiring a isolated hard charged track inside the jet (1 \(\tau\)-prong decays). The 3 \(\tau\)-prong decays can be included by requiring a small number of charged tracks in the jet cone, obtaining a 70% increase in the signal.

The full hadronic final state ([7],[8]) has been studied with particular care on the trigger aspects. The main task is the rejection at trigger level of the huge QCD background. The two experiments have developed specific and slightly different \(\tau\) triggers using a combination of calorimetry (1 prong decay) and tracker. The LVL1 rate is expected to be of the order of 1-2 KHz.

Another feature of these channels is the presence of a large amount of \(E_{Tmiss}\). It has been found that the maximum significance can be obtained requiring the presence of one \(b\)-tagged jet, due to the enhancement of the \(bbA/H\) associated production at large \(\tan\beta\).

Fig. 3 (left plot) shows the reconstructed \(\tau\tau\) mass over the background in the ATLAS experiment for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) (three neutral Higgs boson of 150, 300 and 450 GeV were examined in the simulation) for the semileptonic channel. The right plot shows instead the \(\tau\tau\) mass reconstruction in the full hadronic channel in the CMS experiment with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). In both cases a clear Higgs peak is visible over the background.

Even if the BR is low (\(\mbox{BR}\simeq 10^{-4}\)), the \(H/A\to\mu\mu\) turns out to be an important channel for the discovery [9]. In fact, the enhancement of the \(b\overline{b}\) associated production at large \(\tan\beta\) allows the extraction of the signal from the \(Z/\gamma\to\mu\mu\) and \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds.The presence of 2 isolated muons provides the rejection of QCD \(b\overline{b}\) background, allowing an extremely precise mass resolution (\(\sigma_{m}/m\simeq\) 2-3%).

### The \(H^{\pm}\) discovery channels

If the \(H^{\pm}\) mass is greater than the top quark mass, its main production channel at LHC will be \(gb\to tH^{\pm}\), while the main decay channels are \(H^{\pm}\to tb\) and \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\)[8].

In the first case the final state contains 2 top quark and 3 \(b-jets\). One of the 2 top is required to decay semi-leptonically to provide the trigger. At least 2 non \(b\) jets are expected in the final state, whose invariant mass is required to be compatible with \(M_{W}\). Figure 4 shows the Higgs peak over the QCD and combinatorial background (\(M_{H^{\pm}}=\) 300 GeV).

The \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) channel is selected requiring a 1 prong decay of the \(\tau\). Due to helicity correlations, the single pion is expected to be emitted in the forward direction with respect to the \(\tau\) direction of flight.The

The integrated luminosity is 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) (ATLAS). On the right: the \(\tau\tau\) mass reconstruction in the full hadronic channel for 60 fb\({}^{-1}\) (CMS)._

final state is required to contain at least 3 non \(\tau\) jets, one of which must be a \(b\) jet. The other two jets are required to have an invariant mass compatible with \(M_{W}\). As shown in fig. 4 (right plot), this channel is almost background free and provides a powerful discovery tool already after a few fb\({}^{-1}\) of data taking.

## 3 The Overall Summary

As shown in fig. 5 left plot (\(5\sigma\) discovery contour plots), almost the whole parameter space is completely covered with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) per experiment. The \(t\overline{t}h\) and \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) channels provide the feasibility of the \(h\) discovery in the whole \(\tan\beta\)-\(M_{A}\) plane. For high values of \(\tan\beta\) the neutral Higgs bosons are visible via the \(\tau\tau\) and \(\mu\mu\) decays, while the \(\tau\nu\) and \(tb\) decays of the \(H^{\pm}\) will allow the discovery of the charged Higgs bosons.

The right plot of fig. 5 shows the \(5\sigma\) discovery curves for the ATLAS experiment after 10 fb\({}^{-1}\).

In the intermediate \(\tan\beta\) and high \(M_{A}\) region, \(h\) is the only visible boson. Ongoing studies aim to prove the capability of identifying the SM and MSSM Higgs bosons from ratios of the BR in the various channels (\(b\overline{b}\),\(\gamma\gamma\), VBF channels).

The \(h\) mass determination can be done at low and intermediate \(\tan\beta\) values via the \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) obtaining \(\Delta m/m\simeq 0.1\%\). At high \(\tan\beta\), also the heavy neutral bosons become accessible, allowing a 0.1% mass measurement using the \(\mu\mu\) decay channel. If \(M_{A}\) exceed \(\simeq 350\) GeV, the \(H/A\to\mu\mu\) is not useful, and the \(\tau\tau\) channel must be used, with

On the right: the \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) signal for two different \(M_{H^{\pm}}\) using the ATLAS detector. In both plots the integrated luminosity is 30 fb\({}^{-1}\)._

a worsening in the resolution up to 1%. Where the \(H/A\to\mu\mu\) and \(H/A\to\tau\tau\) are measurable, they can provide also a \(\tan\beta\) measurement with \(5\%<\Delta\tan\beta/\tan\beta<15\%\), depending on \(\tan\beta\) and \(M_{A}\).

## 4 Conclusion

The MSSM Higgs discovery potential of the two general purpose LHC experiments, ATLAS and CMS, have been reviewed in the case of a maximal mixing scenario. At low and intermediate tan \(\beta\) values, only the \(h\) will be visible unless the heavy Higgs bosons can decay into Susy particles, while in the high \(\tan\beta\) region, the \(H/A\to\mu\mu\) and \(H/A\to\tau\tau\) provide not only the feasibility of the discovery, but also a powerful tool to measure the parameters.

The LHC experiments are able to explore the whole \(\tan\beta\)-\(M_{A}\) plane, allowing the discovery of at least one MSSM Higgs boson with slightly more than 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), _i.e._, one year of data taking supposing full low luminosity working conditions for the machine and full performances of the detectors.
