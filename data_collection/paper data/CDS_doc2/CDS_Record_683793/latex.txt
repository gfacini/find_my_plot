**Abstract:**

The drift chambers that will be used to track muons in ATLAS are constructed from layers of drift tubes that have to be stacked, glued, and eventually positioned to an accuracy of 20\(\mu\)m [1]. We describe two mechanical stacking procedures that have been considered and tested at the Max Planck Institute, and report preliminary measurements of the accuracy of placement of wires in drift tubes and of drift tubes into modular stacks.

**Introduction and Preparatory Procedures:**

A prototype drift chamber that is two meters wide, and uses 2.2 m long and 3 cm diameter aluminum drift tubes, is currently being constructed at the Institute. The chamber will have two sectors, each consisting of four layers of interleaved (closely packed) drift tubes. The two sectors will be separated by 25 cm high cross plates that will have mounted on them optical sensors for monitoring the location of the tubes and any distortion of the chamber with time [2]. The outermost layers of the tubes will have small platforms attached precisely to the tubes for additional monitoring of module positions during the stacking of the prototype chamber, as well as for eventual monitoring of the stability of the chamber geometry [3]. A sketch of the chamber configuration is given in Fig. 1.

The overall accuracy required for positioning the drift-tube wires is 20\(\mu\)m [1], which puts severe constraints on the precision needed for stacking of the individual tubes into modules. We have considered two options for such mechanical stacking. One relies on the inherent sub-2\(\mu\)m precision of the diameters of the endplugs that cap the ends of the drift tubes. The other method is based on the use of additional jigs for stacking tubes into position. Clearly, the latter procedure relies less on the inherent precision of the tubes or that of their endplugs.

We have found that the aluminum endplugs manufactured for the Institute have a dispersion in diameter that is of the order of 1\(\mu\)m. This rather remarkable reproduceability of the lathe-turning process is what prompted us to use the uniformity of the endplugs for aligning tubes in a modular stack, and thereby align the anode wires within those tubes with great precision relative to one another. The outer radii of the tubes are typically 53-66\(\mu\)m smaller than the radii of what are termed "Type A" endplugs. Such endplugs can therefore serve as guides for stacking tubes into modules. By assuring that all the endplugs in a Figure 1: Sketch of the chamber configuration. A and B refer to modules with Type A or Type B endplugs. The Rasnik optical sensors are described in Refs. [1] and [2]. All modules are to be attached to the frame (at the cross plates) using 200 \(\mu\)m layers of epoxy.

layer lie at the same height above the precision surface of our granite table, we have been able to maintain the regularity of the stacking (using just endplugs) to an exceptional accuracy of \(<10\mu\)m over a stack width of 16 tubes. This is possible to achieve primarily because of the natural amplification that is obtained in the vertical position of any endplug that is not in its proper location along the horizontal stacking line. (It should be recognized that this type of aligning procedure may not be useful in situations where the tube is too long, and the sag from gravity too great. Under such circumstances, the anode wire has to be supported at the middle of the tube through some type of wire-centering mechanism, a procedure that requires a precise circularity of the tube rather than just that of the endplug.)

The method that we have investigated for stacking drift tubes that have endplugs with diameters that are smaller than those of the drift tubes themselves (the, so-called, "Type B" endplugs) relies on the use of 1.5 cm thick precision aluminum jigs, and requires tubes of exceptionally good circularity. (Previous description of similar techniques can be found in Ref. [4].) Two sets of dies have been constructed, each providing five jigs. Each set of five is to be aligned relative to an edge of a precise granite table, along the 2.2 meter lengths of the tubes, and each is to support a complement of 16 tubes along their lengths. A sketch of the precision gluing jig is given in Fig. 2. Here we see that the jig has an extra set of three tooth-positions on either side. To minimize cost of construction, each of the jigs was machined and wire-eroded five times to obtain a required accuracy of less than \(\pm 20\mu\)m overall deviation in the two end locations of the tubes. The price per jig was 900 DM. The next more sophisticated manufacturing procedure would have involved wire eroding and final polishing by hand, but at four times the cost.

The stacking accuracy of both the method using endplugs as well that using the jigs was checked mechanically as follows. A total of 64 endplugs were stacked in four layers between two precision granite end-walls that set on a precision

granite table. Shims of width that corresponded to half-widths of the endplug were included in each row. The highest points of the top layer were located with a feeler gauge, and measured along the stack and relative to the granite table that supported the entire assembly. The accuracy of the mechanical jigs was checked by an independent certified calibration firm. This was done by placing precision cylinders into the wedges meant to define the tube positions. The positions of the top-most (Y) and side-most (Z) points of these cylinders were subsequently located and measured using a computer controlled high-precision sensor that had a point measuring accuracy and a systematic uncertainty of less than 2\(\mu\)m.

**Results of Preparatory Studies:**

As we mentioned previously, the deviations observed in the difference between expected and measured vertical (Y) positions of the top row of Type A endplugs, stacked in the kind of array described in the previous section, were typically \(<10\mu\)m.

In Fig. 3, we show the results for the precision cylinders positioned in two different jigs (from different dies). We see that there are small systematic deviations observed along the jig, both in the Y and Z directions. From linear fits to the data (shown in the figure), we conclude that the deviation of the measurements from straight lines (except for one unusual point) are consistent with an inherent reproducteability of individual measurements to about 2\(\mu\)m. Consequently, the observed slopes and offsets, although within the specifications of \(\pm 20\mu\)m, are undoubtedly due to small cumulative systematic errors in the construction of the jigs.

We conclude that both types of stacking techniques should be sufficiently precise for assuring that all tubes within a set of 16 are placed to within \(\pm 20\mu\)m relative to each other prior to gluing.

**Initial Studies of Completed Tubes and of their Stacking into Modules:**

In addition to performing the preparatory measurements of jigs and stacks of endplugs described above, we have also started stacking and gluing completed (but not pressurized) drift tubes into modules. The endplugs for these first set of tubes were pressed onto tubes (applying a small amount of methanol for lubricating the O-rings) using a special conical brass tool designed previously for that purpose, and the tubes were crimped onto their endplugs using the MPI mechanical crimping procedure [5]. The 50\(\mu\)m gold-plated tungsten wire was then drawn through the tube and glued into position at a tension of 380 gm.

Axial Angle Between Endplugs and Tubes

The angle of the tube relative to the axis of the Type A endplug was measured for a sample of fully assembled tubes, as follows. With the tube placed on two V-blocks (about 50 cm apart ), a feeler gauge was used to locate the position of the top point on the surface of the tube relative to a granite table. Several pointsFigure 3: Difference between expected and observed positions of precision cylinders stacked along two jigs of the type shown in Fig. 2.

were measured along about a 10 cm length of the tube right next to the endplug, and two measurements were also made at the extreme points (1.4 cm apart) on the protruding lip of the endplug. The tube was then rotated by 45\({}^{o}\), and the analogous measurements repeated. Figure 4 displays the difference observed in the projected angles between the axis of the endplug and that of the tube, as a function of the azimuth of the set of points measured along the tube. Other tubes displayed similar patterns. The typical difference corresponded, roughly, to a bend-angle of about 1 mrad. This bend was always in the same plane, and could be attributed to an apparent "kink" close to the boundary between the endplug and the tube. The cause of this effect was attributed to an asymmetry in the procedure used for press fitting the endplug onto the tube. Subsequent to some minor modification of the tooling, this effect was reduced, but was still in a range that might ultimately compromise the precision of placement of the wire relative to the tube. Nevertheless, it was felt that stacking and gluing of tubes into modules under external pressure would reduce these small excursions, and bring them into tolerable deviation. This matter is still being investigated.

Horizontal (Z) Position of Wire at the Endplug

The positions of the glued wires relative to the precision surfaces of Type A endplugs were checked with a microscope, and found to be placed systematically about 4 \(\mu\)m (on average) from their expected locations along the horizontal (Z) position. In fact, because of a small alignment error, the distribution of positions at the two ends of the tubes were slightly shifted relative to each other, with one end having a mean systematic shift of 6 \(\mu\)m and the other end a mean shift of only 2 \(\mu\)m. After some minor adjustments in the procedures for positioning and gluing of the anode wires, these shifts were reduced substantially (to \(<1\mu\)m!). This is shown in Fig. 5, where we have plotted the displacement of the wire from the expected location for Type B endplugs. As might have been expected from the known variation in tube diameters [6], the dispersion in position was about 30% smaller for measurements relative to the Type A endplugs than relative to the tube surfaces (for Type B endplugs) plotted in Fig. 5.

Positions of Tubes in a Module

Prior to stacking, each tube was checked for gas tightness (required to have a helium leak rate of \(<10^{-5}\) mbar-l/sec), and for reasonable response to a Sr\({}^{90}\)\(\beta\) source [7]. Very few tubes leaked, and those that did could be corrected through an application of epoxy at the wire positions. Similarly, very few tubes (\(<1\)%) had excessive electronic noise.

Fully assembled Type A tubes were stacked into modules of four layers of 16 tubes in each layer. Foils of 100\(\mu\)m were placed between neighboring tube surfaces, and 50\(\mu\)m foils between tubes and all external surfaces. Such shims were placed at three locations (middle and, approximately, quarter positions) along the lengths of the tubes. (The foils were all about 20% under nominal gap Figure 4: Typical difference in the projected angle between the axis of a drift tube (Tube # 614) and its Type A endplug, displayed as a function of tube azimuth.

size.) By applying external pressure on the endplugs from the sides and from above, through a frame attached to the granite table (see Fig. 6), the width and height of the stacks were pressed to nominal size. The stack was epoxied, one layer at a time, with epoxy placed every 10 cm, in about 3 mm wide stripes, across the tubes. Upon release of pressure, the stack expanded to about 15 and 30\(\mu\)m oversize at the positions of the endplugs (Y and Z, respectively). The final positions of the tubes are being measured relative to the edge of the granite table, and the results will be described in the near future.
