**ATLAS Inner Detector Material: Comments and Future Directions**

(Report to the LHCC referees for ATLAS)

_Introduction_

Following the LHCC review of the ATLAS Inner Detector TDR, the LHCC requested a written report outlining the measures decided as well as measures to be investigated to reduce material from the TDR design_ (LHCC/97-46). This report is intended to answer this concern. It is organised into technical areas. In each case the measures already taken are briefly reviewed, followed by a discussion of future actions. Where possible, the specific concerns of the referees are addressed directly.

As described in this report we have, and are, critically studying the material in the inner detector; a number of areas of potential gains have been identified and are actively followed.

The ATLAS ID is required to operate in an extremely hostile environment, and perform detailed measurements in a very high multiplicity environment, at high rate. This requires a large channel count, and the location of electronics and services inside the sensitive volume. This inevitably introduces material. In addition, other constraints cannot be ignored, such as safety, access and repair and the cost ceiling, which rule out certain methods of material reduction. The design takes all of these constraints into account, and represents a good compromise, which leads to a detector that is coherent, well integrated, cost effective and expected to meet the physics needs of ATLAS.

The negative influence of the material on the calorimeter performance has a strong radial dependence. ATLAS has therefore chosen a layout in which all services are taken to the outer radius of the Inner Detector as early as possible. This minimises the calorimeter degradation but gives a peaked distribution of radiation length vs rapidity. The average amount of material in the ID cavity over the acceptance (\(|\eta|\)<2.5) is 62% X\({}_{\circ}\), including all services up to the cryostat wall. The corresponding figure inside the sensitive volume of the tracker itself is 43% X\({}_{\circ}\).

The question of material has been taken into account throughout the ID design, and has been a consideration in every technical decision, together with the other constraints. In addition at the end of 1996 ATLAS appointed a material auditor to review all aspects of the design with the aim of further improvements. The auditor's reports are monitored by the Technical Co-ordination team, and the ATLAS management. A preliminary report on services has already been presented and is under consideration at present. A report on mechanical structures is now in preparation. However, taking into account the requirements of tracking at LHC luminosities, this further examination of the services, structures, cooling and detector elements can only hope to identify a few percent X\({}_{\circ}\) of the current material budget where changes might be implemented.

In the light of the LHCC review, the auditor has been given specific instructions to reconsider the assumptions underlying the mechanical design. In addition the relevant specifications will be reviewed. Further details are given below.

### Mechanical structure

#### Present Status

The design of the mechanical supports of the SCT was a concern during the LHCC review. The referees suggested that the design was overspecified, and that a space-frame design should be considered. In evaluating the potential for material reduction, the masses of the various detector components give some indication of the critical components, although the effect on physics is most visible from material at low radius. The total mass of the ID, including all services inside the cryostat, is estimated to be 3400 kg, dominated by the services. Each carbon fibre cylinder used to support the SCT contributes 5 kg to this total. The mechanical support of the SCT contributes 0.265% X\({}_{0}\) per layer at normal incidence. A breakdown of the SCT material per barrel layer is given in the table below.

#### Material per SCT barrel layer

Modules 1.3 - silicon 0.6 - hybrids 0.4 - structure 0.2

Cooling/mounts 0.4

Power 0.2

A variety of possible designs were considered for this structure, with material being a primary consideration from the beginning. An initial study considered the use of a beryllium spaceframe, with the cooling pipes used as an integrated part of the support structure. This was ruled out on several grounds: the beryllium structure did not have a zero coefficient of thermal expansion and was therefore liable to distortion in case of non-uniform temperatures, the cost was higher (and continues to rise with the run-down of US companies willing to machine Beryllium), and the use of beryllium raises serious safety issues both during construction and maintenance.

Considerable effort has been invested in reducing the material to an absolute minimum in the cylinders. A prototype cylinder will be delivered in October 1997 at a cost of 200kCHF, which will confirm whether the present design can be constructed with existing commercial technology, and ensure that the FEA calculations for the structure are reliable. The possibility of making holes in the cylinder was considered. Because of the risk of delamination, the edges of any such holes would need to be sealed, with additional material. Prototyping this option would be expected to cost more than the existing cylinder cost, since it makes use of non-standard manufacturing but could be reconsidered in the light of experience gained with the first cylinder.

The cylinders are presently designed to be self supporting, so that modules can be precisely surveyed during construction. The referees suggest relaxing this constraint, and recovering the overall rigidity when the barrels are linked together. The interlinks strengthen the cylinders against deformations of the circumference at the ends. This region is reinforced by flanges which support the cylinder ends, since the cylinders are already too weak to prevent such deformations. Each flange contributes 0.9% X\({}_{0}\) over a small \(\eta\) range. The thickness of these flanges will therefore be reconsidered to seek further material reductions. However such an approach would not allow any significant reduction in the thickness of the cylinders themselves. The consequences for the detector survey procedure will also be considered, since the modules are not visible or accessible after the barrels are linked together.

In considering the structural design, an important feature to understand is the immunity to vibration, which is potentially far more harmful than simple distortion. In addition, the access needs must not be overlooked: for example, the LHCC review expressed concerns that the access to the detector should be as simple and modular as possible. However, it is very likely that any attempt to simplify access will lead to extra material in connectors and breaks in the support structure.

### Future Actions

The mechanical structure is currently under review by the material auditor. In addition, an internal review of the mechanical aspects of the ID is planned by the Technical Co-ordinator in October 1997, which will be used to set priorities for the final prototyping phase. This opportunity will be taken to ensure that the options for material reduction are followed up. The final report from the material audit should be ready in time for a comprehensive ATLAS review of mechanics, in April 1998. This review will include ATLAS members from outside the ID community as well as external experts and will be organised by the Technical Co-ordinator. All aspects of the ID mechanics will be investigated, for all three subsystems. Its conclusions will be implemented before any construction work begins.

The material audit will consider the following points on mechanical structure:

* the alignment and construction tolerances
* the arguments in favour of the space frame solution compared to cylinders
* the design of the barrel end-flanges in the SCT and TRT, and possible integration of the barrel support from the TRT, SCT and pixels
* the possibility of increasing the honeycomb size in the composite sandwich, and of changing the skins. One possibility which will be considered is the use of skins with spaced fibres, giving uniformly distributed holes of approximately 1mm scale.

* the possible use of composite cooling pipes integrated into the structure (see below under cooling)
* the design of the thermal shield between the SCT and TRT
* the design of the TRT support structures and carbon fibre shells
* the small parts used for module mounting and connection to the cooling
* the design of the squirrel cage and other services supports.

In addition to the material audit, the following actions are already under way in this area:

* the SCT construction team has presented a technical recommendation to the community that the local supports which link modules into units be dropped in favour of direct mounting of individual modules onto the support cylinders. First indications are that this will reduce the material by 0.1% X\({}_{0}\) per layer, (from a total of 2.2% X\({}_{0}\)), with changes to the mechanical structure and the cooling mounts. The changes make construction and testing more difficult, make access times longer and increase costs. A decision is expected before the November ATLAS week.
* tests are underway with carbon-carbon structures for the pixel detector

### Cooling

Cooling is perhaps the most difficult technical problem facing the SCT and pixels. Heat from the front-end electronics must be evacuated from the heart of the detector, without creating thermal gradients which would lead to structural distortions. Both detectors and electronics must be cooled, as heat dissipation in the detectors after irradiation is sufficient to lead to thermal runaway and the destruction of the device. Decoupling of the detector module from the coolant with power on would also lead to the destruction of the module. The detector must also be operated and maintained at low temperature (-7 C) in order to minimise the effect of radiation damage and reach the design lifetime. It is essential to avoid accidental warm-ups.

The SCT cooling system with mounts contributes 0.39% X\({}_{0}\) per layer in the barrel at normal incidence. In addition the cooling manifolds contribute 1.4% X\({}_{0}\) between
769 < z < 790 cm.

### Present Status

The binary ice system was chosen as the lowest mass option proven to meet the specifications. By using the latent heat of melting of ice, rather than specific heat, the effective energy density of the fluid is 8.5 times that of water, and the heat transfer coefficient is twice that of water (see TDR p497). Single phase systems considered cannot compete in terms of material, or in terms of thermal stability. The binary ice can be run in an under-pressure leakless mode, increasing the safety of the system, and avoiding the need to shutdown ATLAS in the event of minor leaks. Binary ice plants are in widespread use in industry and are under consideration by CERN as a primary cold source for heat exchangers around the LHC site.

The baseline cooling pipes for the SCT are aluminium. The existing material audit commented on the wall thickness of these tubes, and this point is being clarified, with the intention of using a wall thickness of 200 microns, if corrosion studies verify that this possibility is viable. A breakdown of the material in the SCT local cooling is given in the table below, averaged over a barrel layer at normal incidence, together with the material in the manifolding pipework running from the end of the barrels to PPB1 on the cryostat wall. Since these pipes run radially the material contribution is calculated for particles incident axially. Tests are currently under way to demonstrate that manifolding can be performed with binary ice without blockages occurring.

Future plans

The SCT and pixel teams are also pursuing a program of R&D into composite cooling pipes, in order to reduce the material further. Composite tubes have two major problems: they have a low thermal conductivity, reducing the coupling to the coolant, and they require sealing to prevent leaks. The potential advantage is that they can be integrated with the composite support structure. Work is under way at NIKHEF on integrated composite cooling channels in the forward SCT disks, and at RAL on integrated composite stave/cooling pipes for the barrel SCT. The pixel groups are exploring composite structures that include sealing high thermal conductivity carbon-carbon, as well as composite structures with leakless carbon tubes. This work will be pursued until the last date consistent with the construction schedule, and preliminary results will be presented at the ATLAS internal cooling review in September 1997. In addition, corrosion studies on aluminium pipes are under way at present at RAL and CERN in order to evaluate the minimum wall thickness.

The only alternative cooling scheme which offers any significant material saving is an evaporative bi-phase system, using fluorocarbons. This was already identified by ATLAS as a promising avenue for investigation in the material audit. In the pixel system, the material per module at normal incidence due to the coolant would be reduced from 0.116% X\({}_{0}\) to 0.023%. In addition, a factor of two reduction can be made in the distribution pipework which delivers the coolant to the detector, with total savings of 0.5% X\({}_{0}\) at low \(\eta\), rising to 5% X\({}_{0}\) at \(\eta\) of 1.7.

In the SCT, the heat is spread over a larger area, and savings from replacing the coolant are estimated as 0.04% per layer. The changes in the manifolding pipework are likely to be far more significant than this, but only over a limited range of \(\eta\). These savings cannot be estimated accurately without more information on the maximum area which can be cooled by a single delivery pipe, and the possibilitiesfor manifolding the system to supply several staves from a common source. An initial estimate, using the present level of manifolding, would also indicate that a factor of two can be saved on this pipework, i.e. approximately 0.25% X\({}_{0}\) at \(\eta\)=1.0 and 0.6% X\({}_{0}\) at \(\eta\) of 1.5.

At present, no demonstration of manifolding exists, showing uniform supply to several cooled objects. Tests on manifolding are under way for the pixel system. If these are successful, the next step is to scale up the system to the needs of the SCT. This work will proceed with high priority. Following the LHCC review, efforts have been made to find extra manpower, and a thermal model SCT stave will be supplied. First results from these tests will be considered at the ATLAS internal cooling review in September 1997. If the indications are that the evaporative system offers significant advantages in material while meeting the specifications, a full scale prototyping program will be pursued. This is needed to investigate the large scale system aspects of the design, and to show that it can operate safely for barrels and disks in both SCT and pixel systems.

### Other services

#### Present status

The services in the precision part of the ID are already highly optimised for material using optical fibre readout for both SCT and pixels with purpose built low mass packaging for the optical components, and purpose built aluminium on kapton ribbons for power supply distribution. The material audit nonetheless identified some potential savings:

* purpose built ZIF connectors in the power ribbons, reducing the number of connectors required by a factor of two. Reliability is a potential issue here.
* suppression of connectors at patch panels PPB1 and/or PPF1. This complicates access and installation. Up to 10000 connectors could be removed, but all at high radius, on the cryostat wall.
* suppression of 500 12-way fibre optic connections per end at PPF1
* graded thickness or width conductors on the ribbon cables (graded thickness requires new technology).
* rerouting of the pixel B-layer services to avoid the dog-leg effect. This reduces the material inside the acceptance, but increases it at high \(\eta\). It has the additional advantage of allowing the pixel layer to be extracted separately. However, such an access scenario would add material in the support structure and thermal shields. Also, the material at high \(\eta\) produces showers of secondary particles which increase the occupancy in the end-cap regions detectors (both inner detector and calorimeter). These points will be evaluated in detail and presented in the pixel TDR.
* the use of PEEK tubing for fluids where possible (probably only for straight runs at high radius). This could be applied in all three sub-systems.
* the use of aluminium ribbon cables for the TRT power distribution. This was ruled out on cost grounds
* the use of optical readout for the TRT. This was also ruled out on cost grounds.
* the removal of copper lines used to monitor DAC settings in the TRT.

We note that the LHCC referees did not criticise the use of higher mass solutions in the TRT services on cost grounds. We believe indeed that the high investment required to alter them would not bring a proportionate benefit to ATLAS physics.

### Future work

Each of the recommendations of the material audit has been put to the relevant subsystem experts for comments. Some of the suggestions require R&D in order to make a proper evaluation. Reactions will be reported by the ID sub-system project leaders to the management in September. Recommendations on how to further pursue evaporative cooling will be put to the ATLAS cooling review in September 1997. The issue of suppressing connectors requires a study of the overall access scenario with cable pigtails in place. We note that the present ATLAS opening leaves only 110 mm clearance around the ID cradle. A recommendation on these questions is expected for the review of ID mechanics in April 1998. Both the cooling review and the mechanical review will be organised by the Technical Co-ordinator, together with the ID management.

### Other items in the SCT sub-system

#### Hybrids - Present Status

The referees did not comment on the hybrid design until the close-out session, suggesting that 8 micron gold was used, and that the design could be reduced in mass. This may reflect some confusion between the statements on p439 of the TDR (which mentions 8 micron gold) and the detailed description on p469, which correctly states that the hybrid circuit has five 3 micron thick gold interconnect layers. In addition the first three metal layers are gridded, reducing the material by a factor of 4 compared to the standard thick film process. Only the bond pad area uses 8 micron gold. In addition, the chips are thinned, the glue is the minimum thickness of 75 microns, and the glue layers are gridded to use the minimum area. An extensive R&D program was pursued on hybrids before this choice was made, including a comprehensive investigation of kapton based hybrids with beryllium supports. Based on this, the existing design is the best solution which we have found to the complete set of requirements, including mechanical stability, cooling properties and readout needs. The hybrids contribute 0.37% of a radiation length per module, broken down as shown in the table below.

### Future work

We have fully prototyped a solution using kapton based hybrids with 8 micron copper layers. These require an additional element to conduct heat to the cooling pipes and provide mechanical support. We have considered the use of beryllium for this purpose, although this has both cost and safety implications. The possible reduction in material is 0.1% of a radiation length/layer and the technical aspects of this option will be reassessed in the light of the referees comments. It should be noted that the use of more exotic materials such as 'TPG' as a substitute for Be0 is also being actively prototyped.

### Detectors

The n+ on n detector option was chosen by ATLAS as the baseline for the SCT TDR as the design with the best chance of survival under irradiation. However, even this design is not capable of reaching the target signal-to- noise of 15 after ten years of operation, as shown on p435 of the TDR, and reported at the LHCC review. The collaboration is also actively pursuing the possibility of using p on n detector designs as a backup to the baseline. Production orders will have to be placed in the spring of 1998.

The choice of detector polarity has no bearing per se on the material. The referees suggest that the detectors could be thinned if p on n were chosen. This amounts to reducing the signal to noise specification for the detector, or accepting a decreased lifetime. It would also imply an increased cost and decreased yield in detector fabrication.

We have considered this possibility, and took into account the following points:

* the SCT costs 40 MCHF, and replacement of a large part of the system cannot be considered as a standard option.
* a detector on such a large scale (5.6 m long and 1.2 m diameter, with 20 micron internal precision) should not be removed for access if possible.
* if significant warm access after irradiation is needed, or warm-up occurs for any other reason, the detector survival to 10 years of operation cannot be guaranteed
* the fluxes expected from the primary interactions are uncertain to at least a factor of 1.5 from the knowledge of the pp cross- section at LHC energies
* the present detector design is expected to give a signal to noise of around 11 after 10 years of operation (allowing for three yearsof low luminosity running, and the above uncertainties in fluence).

With these points in mind, we consider that the signal-to-noise design goals of the SCT are reasonable, and that we would not wish to put a proposal to the funding agencies for a detector with a significantly lower safety margin, given the scale of the investment needed, and the consequences for ATLAS of the loss of the SCT.

Since thinner detectors have both lower signal and higher noise, we do not propose to pursue the option of thinning detectors, whichever technology is chosen, since in our judgement the risks outweigh the benefits.

### Other items in the pixel system

The major effort in the pixel group to minimize detector material was reported to the LHCC referees during the review. The main areas under investigation are:

* improve layout to reduce module overlap
* reduce detector size and mount chips on mechanical support
* novel carbon-carbon structures with integrated cooling
* thin detectors to take advantage of the high signal-to-noise
* thin electronics wafers
* reduced power consumption
* MCM module construction

The results of these studies will be used to optimise the design to be presented in the Pixel TDR.

### Layouts with fewer precision layers

As detailed above, every option is being pursued to reduce material in the TDR design. The emphasis is to reduce the passive material, if possible, rather than to reduce the detector performance. The question also arises as to whether the detector can meet the physics goals with fewer active elements, by removing one precision layer. This possibility has been under investigation since the spring of 1997. It requires detailed simulation work to evaluate the pattern recognition performance. It is hoped that sufficient information will be available for discussion at the September ATLAS week, although a decision cannot be guaranteed on that timescale.

### Summary and conclusions

The ATLAS collaboration is keenly aware that the performance of the Inner Detector and EM calorimeter would be enhanced by a reduction in material in the ID, if such reductions can be achieved without risking the survival or primary performance goals of the tracker. Concern for the amount of material has taken its proper place, together with the other constraints, in the design presented in the TDR. Nevertheless, ATLAS has also initiated a thorough review of all aspects of the ID material which has been in progress since the beginning of 1997. The scope of this work, and the priority assigned to it, has been further increased following the LHCC review. A number of areas with potential gains have been identified and are actively being followed. In addition, the possibility of reducing the number of precision layers in the ID is under investigation. The conclusions of these investigations will be used in the final optimisation of the detector before construction begins. A written report will be provided to the LHCC after the ID mechanical design review, in May 1998.
