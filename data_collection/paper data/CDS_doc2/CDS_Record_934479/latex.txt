###### Abstract

Split-Supersymmetry and other theories beyond the Standard Model predict massive, stable hadrons, so-called R-hadrons. If such particles are detected at ATLAS, it will be of great interest to measure their mass. Using the time-of-flight method, we show that masses of 300(500) GeV/\(c^{2}\) gluino R-hadrons can be determined with 85 pb\({}^{-1}\) (1.6 fb\({}^{-1}\)) integrated luminosity.

## 1 Introduction

Exotic, long-lived hadrons, so-called R-hadrons, are predicted in many theories beyond the Standard Model (SM). If such particles exist and have a mass within reach of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, their discovery at the ATLAS[1] detector is possible. After discovery, measurements of the R-hadron properties are the next natural step. Mass determination may be important in distinguishing between different theoretical scenarios and could also set the mass hierarchy within one specific scenario. This paper will investigate the prospects of mass measurements for R-hadrons at ATLAS, using the time-of-flight method[2].

The hierarchy problem, the non-unification of the gauge coupling constants and the lack of a dark matter candidate are among the most commonly mentioned problems of the Standard Model. All these problems find their solution in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)[3], which is the most popular supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. A more recent scenario, Split-Supersymmetry[4], suggests that the hierarchy problem can be addressed by the same fine-tuning mechanism that solves the cosmological constant problem, making low energy supersymmetry (SUSY) uncalled for.

When the requirement of SUSY to solve the hierarchy problem is abandoned, supersymmetry can be broken at a scale much larger than the TeV scale. This leads to a new interesting phenomenology, with heavy scalars, light fermions and a light, finely tuned Higgs particle[4]. In such

a scenario the gluino will be meta-stable, since the favoured decay mode for a gluino is through a squark, see Figure 1. However, the amplitude for this decay will be small since the squark is a very heavy scalar. If the lifetime of the gluinos is long enough they will hadronise into bound states of gluinos and quarks, forming so-called R-hadrons. Possible kinds of gluino R-hadrons are listed in Table 1.

Meta-stable gluinos can also arise in other SUSY scenarios, in particular Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB)[5]. In some GMSB scenarios stops may be meta-stable, and form R-hadrons as well.

The procedure for mass measurements described in this work is applicable to any charged, massive, stable particle (CMSP). Such particles are predicted in many theories beyond the Standard Model, for instance in leptoquark theories[6] and Universal Extra Dimensions[7].

Searches for gluino R-hadrons have already been performed at the Tevatron, where the gluino mass limit is estimated to be 200 GeV/\(c^{2}\) at the end of Run II[8].

## 2 _Simulation of R-hadrons_

Some models of R-hadron interactions regard the constituent gluino as a stable, passive spectator, surrounded by an interacting cloud of quarks[9]. As a consequence the interaction energy is low; at the order of a few GeV.

Other features of R-hadron scattering are for instance that mesonic states almost always will turn into baryonic states[10], and that R-hadrons can change the sign of their electric charge. This property is often referred to as charge flipping. Charge flipping can be used to extract a pure sample of R-hadrons, as shown in [9].

Only one model of R-hadron scattering is implemented in Geant-3[11]. This model simulates nuclear interactions of heavy hadrons independently of the physics scenario in which the hadrons arise[9]. The total cross-section is set constant to 24 mb for R-meson and 36 mb for R-baryon interactions. Additionally the matrix elements, corresponding to each of the 140 included reactions, are set constant. A detailed description of

The data sample used in this study was produced using Pythia[16][17] for gluino pair production, Geant-3 for detector simulation and Athena 10.0.2 for reconstruction. R-hadrons of mass 300 and 500 GeV/\(c^{2}\) were generated.

## 3 Mass Measurements

### Track reconstruction

R-hadrons are stable on a time-scale corresponding to their passage through ATLAS. They can therefore be detected in the ATLAS muon system[18]. Most of them have \(\beta=\frac{v}{c}<1\), and will therefore be detected as delayed muons. This has an impact on how well their tracks are reconstructed in the muon system. The MOORE[19] reconstruction algorithm in Athena[20] assumes particles to have \(\beta=1\), this will give bad \(\chi^{2}\)-values for the fitted R-hadron tracks. Different values of \(\beta\) can, however, be assumed for the track reconstruction for each sample of simulated events. We then expect the average \(\chi^{2}\) to have a minimum value when the assumed \(\beta\) agrees with the real value.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of generated \(\beta\) for two different R-hadron masses. As expected the 500 GeV/\(c^{2}\) mass particles (solid line) have lower \(\beta\) compared to the 300 GeV/\(c^{2}\) case (dotted line). Slow moving particles need to reach the muon system in time to be associated with the correct bunch crossing, this will always be the case if \(\beta\geq 0.7\)[21].

Even though we know that most R-hadrons will have \(\beta<1\), we do not know what value of \(\beta\) they will have or what their mass will be. However, all produced R-hadrons will be of approximately the same mass, since the gluino dominates the mass spectrum. From this fact and the relativistic momentum equation

\[\beta=\frac{p}{\sqrt{p^{2}+m^{2}}}, \tag{1}\]

we know that the value of \(\beta\) will remain constant within a (narrow) momentum interval.

The following approach was used to measure \(\beta\); the R-hadron candidates were divided into momentum intervals, since particles with a common (unknown) mass, within one such interval will have approximately similar \(\beta\). In addition, the MOORE fit was rerun varying the value of \(\beta\) between 0.7 and 1.0 in steps of \(\Delta\beta=0.05\). For each momentum interval the computed average \(\chi^{2}\) for all tracks was plotted as a function of the assumed value of \(\beta\). This distribution will have a minimum at a value \(\beta_{M}\) which we use as our measured value of \(\beta\) in that particular momentum interval. This approach to \(\beta\)-measurements was first shown in [2].

### \(\beta\)-measurements

Figures 3 and 4 show the average \(\chi^{2}\) as a function of assumed \(\beta\) in ten different momentum intervals, for generated masses of 300 and 500 GeV/\(c^{2}\). The step size is 50 GeV in both mass-cases, while the momentum value starts at 300 and 600 GeV, for R-hadrons of mass 300 and 500 GeV/\(c^{2}\) respectively. For 300(500) GeV/\(c^{2}\) R-hadrons the lowest momentum interval contains roughly 600(400) events, decreasing to about 100 in the highest momentum interval. The following two cuts; \(|\eta|<2.5\) and number of MDT2-hits \(>10\), are applied to the events to ensure good tracks. The rejection rate of the cuts is 7% for both mass cases. The minima in both Figure 3 and 4 are fitted by polynomial functions, and by finding the minima of these functions we find our estimated value for \(\beta_{M}\). The results of the measurements are shown in Table 2. From the table we see that the agreement between measured \(\beta_{M}\) and the true value \(\beta_{T}\)3 is

good. An overall tendency is that the measurement gives a slightly lower value than the nominal one. The effect is not dramatic but will cause the measured masses to be a bit larger than the nominal mass.

There are ambiguities in where to find the true minimum in some momentum slices in both figures. However, the consistency of the measured minima can be checked by plotting the measured \(\beta\) as a function of momentum, as seen in Figures 5 and 6. The points are fitted with the relativistic momentum relation (Eqn. 1), assuming a common mass which is left as a free parameter. Two cases of ambiguous minima are included in both figures, and it becomes apparent that the correct minima will follow the theoretical curve, while the wrong ones will be far off.

When \(\beta\) is measured all the information needed to obtain the mass is present. Figures 7 and 8 show the distribution of masses obtained for individual R-hadron candidates using the measured momentum and the \(\beta_{M}\) for the relevant momentum interval as given in Table 2. Both figures show a result close to the nominal mass, with a mean value of the mass at \(306.3\pm 0.1\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) and \(518.1\pm 0.2\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) for generated masses of 300 and 500 GeV/\(c^{2}\) respectively. Note that both mass distributions are larger than the nominal values, and we are investigating possible sources of systematic errors.

The production cross-section for 300(500) GeV/\(c^{2}\) R-hadrons is 567(35) pb. After correcting for cut efficiencies and the fraction of R-hadrons that are not single-charged in the muon system the visible cross-section becomes 223(10.4) pb. We then find that the number of events used in the distributions of Figures 7 and 8 correspond to an integrated luminosity

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\(m_{R}=\) 300 GeV/\(c^{2}\)} \\ \hline P (GeV) & \(\beta_{T}\) & \(\beta_{M}\) \\ \hline

of 85 pb\({}^{-1}\) for the 300 GeV case and 1.6 fb\({}^{-1}\) for 500 GeV case. This type of study will therefore be limited by systematic effects up to very high R-hadron masses.

## 4 _Summary & Outlook_

We have shown that it is possible to reconstruct the mass of charged, massive, stable particles, using the time-of-flight method in ATLAS. Results for both 300 and 500 GeV/\(c^{2}\) R-hadrons are slightly over-estimated. Improvement and investigations need to be directed toward the \(\beta\)-measurement procedure. Understanding false minima and irregular behaviour of the distributions will be necessary in order to do this.

Recently the R-hadron interaction model was implemented in Geant-4 [22][23], a natural step will be to proceed using this new detector simulation tool. By moving on to Geant-4 more thorough studies will be preformed, for instance by studying the interaction of R-hadrons in the calorimeter, measurements of larger masses and how the measurements will be influenced by background from muons.
