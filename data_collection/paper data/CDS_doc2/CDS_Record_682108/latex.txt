**Abstract**

For the purity monitoring system of the ATLAS liquid argon calorimeters several basic monitors will be used as measuring devices. Each basic monitor contains an \({}^{241}\)Am- and a \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell. In this note, we present the specific features of each cell as well as a study of the expected dependence of the signals on the concentration of electronegative impurities \(p\) in the liquid argon and the electric field \(\vec{E}\). Theoretical predictions on the absolute signal height and the sensitivity to impurities are given. For the more complicated \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell, results of a Monte Carlo study regarding the expected peak shape and width are shown.

## 1 Introduction

In liquid argon (LAr) calorimeters like the hadronic end-cap calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment, capturing of drifting electrons by electronegative impurities like O\({}_{2}\)

\[S+e^{-}\longrightarrow S^{-} \tag{1}\]

leads to smaller signals of the detector. Therefore it is necessary to monitor the concentration \(p\) of these electronegative impurities, measured in ppmO\({}_{2}\)-equivalents, or their effect, a limited lifetime \(\tau\) or a limited mean free path length \(\lambda\) of drifting electrons due to impurities in the calorimeter.

The purity monitor system of ATLAS is described in [1]. A main part of this monitor system is called Basic Monitor. His sensitivity regarding electronegative impurities is described here.

The lifetime \(\tau\) of drifting electrons due to electronegative impurities is given by [2]

\[\tau=\frac{1}{k_{s}p}. \tag{2}\]

\(p\) is the concentration of electronegative impurities and \(k_{s}\) is a rate constant. The time depending amount of a drifting charge \(Q_{ideal}(t)\) is reduced by an exponential factor

\[Q_{seen}(t)=Q_{ideal}(t)e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}. \tag{3}\]

At Mainz, we measure the parameter \(\tau\) directly with a laser-cell [1].

The lifetime \(\tau\) and the mean free path length \(\lambda\) due to electronegative impurities correspond to each other via

\[\lambda=\tau v_{D} \tag{4}\]

with the drift velocity \(v_{D}\). Inserting (2) and

\[v_{D}=\mu\big{|}\vec{E}\big{|}, \tag{5}\]

where \(\mu\) is the mobility of the drifting electrons, parameter \(\lambda\) is given by [3]

\[\lambda=\alpha\frac{\big{|}\vec{E}\big{|}}{p} \tag{6}\]

with the electric field \(\vec{E}\) which causes the drift of the electrons, and a constant

\[\alpha=\frac{\mu(\big{|}\vec{E}\big{|})}{k_{S}(\big{|}\vec{E}\big{|})}. \tag{7}\]

In liquid argon, this constant is given by

\[\alpha_{\alpha}=\big{(}0.14\pm 0.03\big{)}\frac{\mathrm{ppmO}_{2}\,\mathrm{ cm}^{2}}{\mathrm{kV}} \tag{8}\]

for ionization with an \(\alpha\)-source and

\[\alpha_{\beta}=\big{(}0.15\pm 0.03\big{)}\frac{\mathrm{ppmO}_{2}\,\mathrm{ cm}^{2}}{\mathrm{kV}} \tag{9}\]

for ionization with an \(\beta\)-source at \(p\approx 1\mathrm{ppm}\,\mathrm{O}_{2}\) and electric fields up to \(10\frac{\mathrm{kV}}{\mathrm{cm}}\)[3]. For \(|\vec{E}|>10\frac{\mathrm{kV}}{\mathrm{cm}}\), the mean free path length \(\lambda\) is larger than given in (6).

The number of electron-ion-pairs \(\frac{Q_{ini}}{e}\) produced by one ionizing particle is given by

\[\frac{Q_{ini}}{e}=\frac{E}{W} \tag{10}\]with the energy of the particle \(E\) and the meaning energy \(W\) (\(W\) = 23.6 eV for LAr). This number of electrons is immediately reduced by recombination of electrons and positive ions, which can be described with the Box-model [4, 5] :

\[\frac{Q_{0}}{e}\,=\,\frac{Q_{ini}}{e}\frac{|\vec{E}|}{E_{0}}\ln(1+\frac{E_{0}}{| \vec{E}|}). \tag{11}\]

\(E_{0}\) is given as \(E_{0}\) = 470 \(\frac{\mathrm{kV}}{\mathrm{cm}}\) for an \(\alpha\)-source [4] and \(E_{0}\) = 0.80 \(\frac{\mathrm{kV}}{\mathrm{cm}}\) for a \(\beta\)-source (\({}^{113}\)Sn) [5]. \(Q_{0}\) is the effective drifting charge after recombination.

with the mean free path length \(\lambda\). This function is shown in figure 3. Since the geometry and electrical field of the hadronic end-cap calorimeter is almost similar to the \({}^{241}\)Am-cell (\(d=2\) mm, \(|\vec{E}|=12.5\)\(\frac{\mathrm{kV}}{\mathrm{cm}}\)), it is possible to measure the parameter \(\lambda\) of the hadronic endcap calorimeter directly in case of large impurities (\(p>2\) ppmO\({}_{2}\), which conforms to \(\frac{\lambda}{d}<4\), see formula (6) and fig. 3).

Since \(\lambda\) and \(Q_{0}\) are functions of \(|\vec{E}|\), we obtain by inserting (6) and (11) into

Figure 4: _Expected signal of the \({}^{241}\)Am-cell (\(d=2\) mm) as a function of impurity \(p\)._

(14) (see Ref. [6])

\[Q(p,|\vec{E}|)=Q_{ini}\frac{|\vec{E}|}{E_{0}}\ln\left(1+\frac{E_{0}}{|\vec{E}|} \right)\,\frac{\alpha|\vec{E}|}{p\,d}\,\,\left(1-e^{-\frac{p}{\alpha|\vec{E}|} }\right) \tag{16}\]

with \(Q_{ini}=37\) fC and \(E_{0}=470\,\frac{\mathrm{kV}}{\mathrm{cm}}\). This function is shown for different electric fields and different impurities in figures 4 and 5.

Note that it is impossible to improve the absolute sensitivity regarding the impurity \(p\) by decreasing the electric field for the \({}^{241}\)Am-cell. An improvement might be expected from the relation \(\lambda\propto|\vec{E}|\) (according to (6)), but this leads to a very small effect only, as the almost parallel lines in Fig. 4 suggest.

## 3 The \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell

The conversion electron of \({}^{207}\)Bi around 1 MeV has a range of approximately 3.5 mm (see Tab. 1) in liquid Argon (value obtained by numerical integration of the Bethe-Bloch-formula with an initial energy of the electron of 1 MeV), therefore the complete track of the conversion electron fits into the first gap of the cell. Because of the lower ionization density compared to an \(\alpha\)-particle the recombination effect is much smaller. Approximately, the ionization density is constant along the track of the conversion electron.

Figure 6: _Scheme of the \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell. The electrodes are made out of inox, and this two disks and the grid are separated with spacers made out of polyimid._

### Estimation of the expected signal height

If \(z_{max}<d_{1}\) is the range of the conversion electron, one obtains for the ionization density, projected onto \(\vec{v}_{D}\):

\[\rho_{0}\,=\,\frac{Q_{0}}{z_{0}}\,\,,\quad 0\,<\,z_{0}\,<\,z_{max} \tag{17}\]

with \(z_{0}\,=\,z_{max}\,\cos\alpha\), where \(\alpha\) denotes the angle between the conversion electron track and \(\vec{v}_{D}\) (see figure 8). The ratio

\[\frac{\rho_{1}(z)}{\rho_{0}}\,=\,e^{-\frac{d_{1}-z}{\lambda_{1}}}\,\,,\quad 0 \,<\,z\,<\,z_{0} \tag{18}\]

is the portion of drifting electrons, which were created in a distance \(z\) from the cathode and actually arrived at the Frisch-grid. \(\lambda_{1}\) is the mean free path length

Figure 8: _Explanation of the parameter \(z_{0}\) as the projection of the total length \(z_{max}\) of a primary electron track with the emission angle \(\alpha\) onto the drift direction of the secondary electrons._

Figure 7: _Spectrum of the \({}^{241}\)Bi-cell, taken at CERN, 6.5.97._in the first drift gap. The total charge of the electrons, which arrive at the grid, is given by

\[Q_{1} = \int_{z\,=0}^{z\,=z_{0}}\rho_{1}(z)\ dz\]

Figure 10: _Expected signal of a \({}^{20\,7}\)Bi-cell as a function of the electric field \(|\vec{E}_{1}|\) using a typical track length \(z=1\ mm\)._

Figure 9: _Expected Signal of a \({}^{20\,7}\)Bi-cell as a function of impurity \(p\). The signal for a conversion electron parallel (\(z_{0}=3\) mm) and orthogonal (\(0\,z=0\) mm) to drift-direction is shown. The difference between both functions is a measure for the width of the signal-peak in the histogram due to the distribution of the emission-angle of the conversion electron._

\[= Q_{0}\ \frac{\lambda_{1}}{z_{0}}\ e^{-\frac{d_{1}}{\lambda_{1}}}\left(e^ {\frac{z_{0}}{\lambda_{1}}}-1\right). \tag{19}\]

These electrons drifting across the second gap influence a current on the anode. The integrated current \(Q_{2}\) is (similar to (14) ):

\[Q_{2} = Q_{1}\frac{\lambda_{2}}{d_{2}}\ \left(1-e^{-\frac{d_{2}}{\lambda_{2} }}\right) \tag{20}\] \[= Q_{0}\ \frac{\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}}{z_{0}\ d_{2}}\ e^{-\frac{d_{1} }{\lambda_{1}}}\ \left(1-e^{-\frac{d_{2}}{\lambda_{2}}}\right)\ \left(e^{\frac{z_{0}}{\lambda_{1}}}-1\right),\]

assuming, that the time constant of the integrating preamplifier is much larger than the drift time across the second gap. Inserting (6) and (11) into (20), one obtains (see Ref. [6])

\[Q_{2}=Q_{ini}\frac{|\vec{E_{1}}|}{E_{0}}\ln\left(1+\frac{E_{0}}{|\vec{E_{1}}|} \right)\ \frac{\alpha^{2}|\vec{E_{1}}|}{p^{2}\ z_{0}\ d_{2}}\ e^{-\frac{p}{\alpha}\frac{d_{1}}{| B_{1}|}}\left(1-e^{-\frac{p}{\alpha}\frac{d_{2}}{|B_{2}|}}\right)\left(e^{ \frac{p}{\alpha}\frac{10}{|B_{1}|}}-1\right) \tag{21}\]

with \(d_{1},d_{2}\) being the width of each gap. This function is shown for different electric fields and different impurities in figures 9 and 10.

The condition \(d_{1}>z_{max}\approx 3\) mm limits the sensitivity range towards larger impurities \(p\), nevertheless it is possible to increase the sensitivity to smaller values of \(p\) by increasing the width of the first gap \(d_{1}\).

To a chi\(\mathrm{e}\)e maximum transparency of the Frisch-grid for drifting electrons, it is necessary that the electric fields \(\vec{E_{1}}\) and \(\vec{E_{2}}\) in both regions fulfill the relation \(3\vec{E_{1}}\leq\vec{E_{2}}\)[7, 8, 9]. Since (6), for large electric fields in the second drift region \(\lambda_{2}\gg d_{2}\) applies and therefore yields \(Q_{2}\simeq Q_{1}\) for moderate values of \(p\).

In principle, it is possible to measure the mean ionization energy of liquid argon with the \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell because recombination effects only contribute little to the decrease of the signal height (compared to the \({}^{241}\)Am-cell).

### Monte Carlo simulation of the \({}^{207}\)Bi signal

The main peak of the \({}^{207}\)Bi spectrum originates from charge deposited along the conversion electron tracks which are created with an initial energy of \(E_{e^{-}}=976\) keV and \(E_{e^{-}}=1047\) keV at rates of 7% and 2% (with regard to all decays of \({}^{207}\)Bi) respectively. Therefore the observed peak has a more complicated substructure which prohibits a gaussian fit. Furthermore the peak width depends on the level of impurities as expected from Fig. 9. In order to study these effects as well as the effect of the grid, a Monte Carlo simulation has been performed. To a first approximation only the two conversion electron lines contribute to the peak. The photo peak at 1067 keV is suppressed by its small cross section at 1 MeV and the limited cell volume (active radius \(r_{active}=12.5\) mm). The background produced by Compton electrons belonging to the 1067 keV \(\gamma\) line has been neglected, but can be simulated in principal.

Figure 11: _Expected signal of the \({}^{207}\)Bi cell with a grid: Monte Carlo simulated conversion electron peaks at \(E_{e}\)– \(1047\) keV and \(E_{e}\)– \(=976\) keV for different levels of impurities (0.5 ppmO\({}_{2}\) to 5.0 ppm O\({}_{2}\)-equivalents). The drifting charge in the second gap of \(1\) mm (first gap: 5 mm) has been integrated in order to simulate an ideal charge sensitive preamplifier connected to the anode. The open histograms show the sum of both conversion electron peaks._

The drifting charge in the gap of 5 mm has been integrated in order to simulate an ideal charge sensitive preamplifier connected to the anode. The open histograms show the sum of both conversion electron peaks._

Monte Carlo simulated conversion electron peaks at \(E_{e-}=1047\) keV, \(E_{e-}=976\) keV (halched contributions) and \(E_{e-}=4\,81\) keV (peak with long dashed line) and Compton continua for the \(\gamma\) energies of \(E_{\gamma}=1770\) keV (tail on the right hand side), \(E_{\gamma}=1063\) keV (dashed line contribution) and \(E_{\gamma}=569\) keV (dotted line). The resulting complete spectrum is shown by the open histogram summing the individual contributions. The drifting charge of the produced track segments in the second gap of 1 mm (first gap: 5 mm) has been integrated in order to simulate an ideal charge sensitive preamplifier connected to the anode._

For the simulation of the peak structure two sets of conversion electron tracks originating in the middle of the cathode are created with their end points drawn from a random distribution on the half sphere contained in the active volume. The track length and the relative charge distribution \(g(z)=\frac{\rho_{0}(z)}{Q_{0}}\) along the tracks is calculated by numerically integrating the Bethe-Bloch formula for electrons [10]. Table 1 shows the resulting track lengths. Differently from the approximation used so far, assuming a homogeneous secondary electron density along the primary electron track, the integration for \(Q_{1}\) has to be done numerically. Thus formula (19) becomes

\[Q_{1}/Q_{0}=\int_{z=0}^{z=z_{0}}g(z)e^{-\frac{d_{1}-z}{\lambda_{1}}}dz \tag{22}\]

Calculating again the mean free absorption lengths \(\lambda\) according to Hofmann's formula (6) and the initially deposited charge \(Q_{0}\) using the Box model (formula (11)) the effectively influenced charge on the cathode is obtained. The geometry and the electric fields are choosen according to the standard values used so far (\(d_{1}=5\) mm, \(d_{2}=1\) mm, \(|\vec{E_{1}}|=5\) kV/cm and \(|\vec{E_{2}}|=12.5\) kV/cm). A gaussian smearing with a width of \(\sigma=0.1\) fC on top of the integrated charge is applied on an event by event basis to simulate readout noise.

Fig. 11 presents the obtained spectra for different values of impurity \(p\) ranging from 0.1 to 5.0 ppmO\({}_{2}\). An increase in the peak widths with increasing impurity is observed leading to a superposition of both peaks. This effect is due to the different charge attenuation for primary electron tracks going perpendicular or (almost) parallel to the surface of the cathode. At impurities of about 1 ppmO\({}_{2}\) the 1047 keV peak creates a shoulder at the right hand side of the 976 keV peak which is be observed in the real data as well. It should be noted that below about 1 fC the signal can not any longer be separated from the noise background (due to the worsening signal to noise ratio as observed in a typical setup) and therefore it will be impossible to observe a peak at higher impurities than 3 ppmO\({}_{2}\).

The effect of the grid is demonstrated by Fig. 12, where the drifting charge has been integrated using only one gap with \(d_{1}=5\) mm. Thus, the charge of the secondary electrons is integrated from the instant it is deposited. For impurities smaller than 1 ppmO\({}_{2}\) an extremely wide distribution is observed for the "peaks". This effect is due to the spherical distribution of the electron tracks, which leads to large differences in the mean drifting time of the secondary

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline \(E_{e-}/\)keV & \(P_{conv}\) & \(l_{track}/\)cm \\ \hline
976 & 7\% & 0.33 \\
1047 & 2\% & 0.36 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

At higher impurity levels the peak width becomes comparable with (or even smaller than) the ones from cell with the grid, showing the effect of the electron lifetime being much smaller than the typical drifting time. The main contribution to the signal in this case comes from the initially drifting charge which is rapidly diminished. Using the cell without the grid to measure at somewhat higher levels of impurity than 3 ppmO 2, the range of sensitivity - even at the cost of sensitivity to small changes of \(p\) - is limited by the smallness of the integrated charge which eventually can not be separated from the noise background below about 1 fC equivalent charge.

First steps have been taken to include the charge deposited along track segments induced by Compton or photo electrons produced by the \(\gamma\) s of the \({}^{207}\)Bi decay. In Fig. 13 the effects of the Compton (and very improbable photo effect) produced electron tracks of the three \(\gamma\) lines at 1770 keV, 1063 keV and 569 keV as well as the lower conversion electron line at \(E_{e-}\) = 481 keV have been included in addition to the two previously used conversion electron lines. Due to the large absorption length regarding the photo effect in liquid argon (about \(\sim 3\cdot 10^{4}\) cm at \(E_{\gamma}\sim 1\) MeV, in contrast to about \(\sim 13\) cm for the Compton effect) direct photo peaks are strongly suppressed in the small fiducial volume of the \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell. The additional effects have been simulated with relative contributions according to the cascade of decay of the \({}^{207}\)Bi spectrum. Note however, that no attempt has been made to include the effect of energy lost by the primary electron in the cathode material prior to entering the liquid argon. This effect, which depends on the implantation depth of the emitting \({}^{207}\)Bi-atom and the emission angle \(\alpha\), possibly leads to an energy smearing of the conversion electron peaks towards lower energies. This and noise on the preamplifier's input observed in real data possibly account for the difference in the Monte Carlo and data spectra.

## 4 Conclusion

The expected signal of the \({}^{241}\)Am- and the \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell has been studied as a function of the impurities in the liquid argon. A Monte Carlo simulation for the \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell has been performed to study the shape of the signal peaks and it's dependence on the impurities.

Figure 14 shows the different behavior of \({}^{207}\)Bi- and \({}^{241}\)Am-cell as a function of impurities \(p\). Fig. 15 shows the derivative of the signal \(Q\) to \(p\) which demonstrates the different sensitivities: The \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell has a high sensitivity to changes of the impurity at 1 ppmO 2, the \({}^{241}\)Am-cell has a long range of sensitivity regarding \(p\) and allows a direct measurement of the mean free path length \(\lambda\) of electrons at the same electric field as applied to the hadronic endcap calorimeter.

As the Monte-Carlo study shows, the \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell with the grid in its presented geometry is therefore expected to provide a measuring device for impuritiesFigure 15: _Sensitivity of both cells with the same parameters as in figure 14. At \(1\) ppm0\({}_{2}\), the sensitivity of the \({}^{207}\)Bi-cell is ten times larger than the sensitivity of the \({}^{241}\)Am-cell. Note the different scales of the x-axis!_

in the range below about 3 ppmO2 with a high sensitivity to small changes. Hence, it nicely complements the \({}^{241}\)Am-cell at the expected level of impurities (\(\sim 1\) ppmO2) which provides a coarser measurement over a wider range.

In order to combine those features, a high sensitivity at the point of interest, coverage of a wide range and a measurement of the attenuation length \(\lambda\) in a geometry very similar to the hadronic endcap calorimeter's (HEC), the Basic - Monitor contains both, one \({}^{20}\)Bi- and one \({}^{241}\)Am-cell.
