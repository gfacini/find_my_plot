**Abstract**

A modification of the MUST (Muon Silicon Tracker) concept is proposed. Providing the silicon tracker with its own (permanent) magnet makes MUST feasible both for the calibration of the ATLAS barrel muon spectrometer and of the forward muon detector. A possible realization of the MUST permanent magnet, similar to the magnet of the AMS detector, is considered. Momentum resolution, muon rates and other basic characteristics of the proposed MUST scheme are discussed.

Introduction

A MUon Silicon Tracker (MUST), a small spectrometer for the calibration of the ATLAS muon system, was proposed in [1]. Three sensitive planes of silicon crystals placed in the B-field of the muon system measure muon momenta with a resolution sufficient for the calibration of the muon alignment system to achieve the goal of 30\(\mu\)m sagitta error.

The difficulties with the proposed system are:

* in the barrel region with good magnetic field space is very limited;
* in the end-cap regions with enough space between the middle and the outer chamber layers there is no B-field.

A solution to this problem could be to provide the MUST tracker system with its own magnetic field. In this case MUST could be used almost everywhere in the barrel and in the end-caps.

A permanent magnet built of modern magnetic materials makes MUST rather light and portable and provides for sufficient bending power BL\({}^{2}\).

A possible realization of the MUST permanent magnet based on the design of the magnet of the AMS detector, and the MUST momentum resolution, muon rates and other basic characteristics are discussed in this note.

## 2 The AMS Permanent Magnet

The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) is a detector for extraterrestrial study of antimatter, matter and missing matter in the International Space Station Alpha [2].

Basic elements of the spectrometer are a permanent magnet, a tracker (Time Projection Chamber or silicon layers) inside the magnet, a trigger system (scintillator layers) and Cerenkov counters.

The prototype version of the AMS will be launched into the Earth's orbit in fall 1996. The operation of the full AMS detector on the Alpha space station is planned for the period 2001 - 2003.

The AMS permanent magnet (which is the only issue for us here) is made of a rare earth magnetic material Nd-Fe-B, which has very high maximal magnetic energy \((B\times H)_{Max}\simeq(42-46)\cdot 10^{6}\)GOe.

There are two options for the cross section of the magnet:

* annular: an internal radius of 0.6 m and an external radius of 0.65 m;
* squared with a side length of 1 m and a wall thickness of 5 cm.

For both options the direction of the B-field is orthogonal to the axis of the magnet axis (contrary to the solenoidal B-field).

The main characteristics of the AMS magnet are the same for both variants, they are shown in Table 1.

The characteristics of the magnetic field are the followings:

* the B-field is nearly homogeneous in the entire working volume;
* the flux leakage outside the magnet is very small;
* the dipole momentum is negligible;
* the field is stable to \(\leq\) 6.5 ppm/hour.

All these characteristics make a permanent magnet of this type a good candidate for the MUST magnet.

## 3 The MUST Permanent Magnet

For the evaluation of the MUST permanent magnet parameters the characteristics of Nd-Fe-B (the magnetic material of the AMS magnet) will be used.

The cross-section of the MUST magnet can be either annular (see Fig. 1) or squared (see Fig. 2). The main features of both types of the magnet are the same. In this note the example of the annular magnet will be considered.

For the annular magnet the magnetic strength B is defined by the expression

\[B=B_{0}\cdot\ln\frac{r_{out}}{r_{inn}}, \tag{1}\]

where

* \(r_{inn}\) and \(r_{out}\) are the inner and the outer radii of the ring;
* \(B_{0}\) is defined by the properties of the magnetic materials.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Parameter & Value \\ \hline Cross-section & 1.0 m\({}^{2}\) \\ \hline Length & 1.2 m \\ \hline Weight & 1900 kg \\ \hline B-field strength & 0.1 T \\ \hline Total cost & 720 k\$ \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Parameters of the AMS magnet For the Nd-Fe-B material

\[B_{0}\simeq 1\ \mathrm{T}. \tag{2}\]

The weight of this magnet is equal to

\[W=\pi\cdot(r_{out}^{2}-r_{inn}^{2})\cdot L\cdot d, \tag{3}\]

where \(L\) is the length of the magnet, and \(d\) is the density of the Nd-Fe-B alloy

\[d\simeq 5\ g/\mathrm{cm}^{3}. \tag{4}\]

The MUST cross-section area \(S\) as proposed in [1] is \(S\simeq 0.06\ \mathrm{m}^{2}\). For the spectrometer proposed here we will consider two options: (a) \(r_{inn}^{a}=15\ \mathrm{cm}\), and (b) \(r_{inn}^{a}=20\ \mathrm{cm}\), with cross sections of \(S_{MUST}^{a}\simeq.07\ \mathrm{m}^{2}\), and \(S_{MUST}^{b}\simeq.12\ \mathrm{m}^{2}\), respectively.

For technical reasons (support frame, electronics boxes and so on) only some part of the total cross section can be covered by sensitive silicon strips.

We will conservatively assume that the effective area of the spectrometer is twice less than the total cross-section of the magnet (\(\varepsilon_{eff}=0.5\)).

In the proposal [1] the length of the spectrometer was limited by the distance between the BIL and BML chambers to \(1.2\ \mathrm{m}\)[1]. For a solution with a permanent magnet placed outside the ATLAS Muon System there is no such limitation. Nevertheless we will assume the same length of magnet

\[L=1.2\ \mathrm{m}. \tag{5}\]

As will be shown in Section 4 such a value for the length of the magnet is adequate for the purposes of MUST.

The weight of the magnet for the given values of its inner radius and length is a function of its magnetic field strength. From eqs. (1) and (3) the following expression can be obtained:

\[W=\pi\cdot r_{inn}^{2}\cdot L\cdot d\cdot(e^{\frac{2B}{B_{0}}}-1). \tag{6}\]

Figure 3 shows the dependence of the magnet weight W on the value of magnetic field strength B for the assumptions (4), (5), and for the two options (a) and (b). The magnetic field strength of \(B=.3\ \mathrm{T}\) is sufficient for the required momentum resolution in MUST (see Section 4).

In this case the weight of the magnet is \(W_{a}=350\ \mathrm{kg}\), and \(W_{b}=620\ \mathrm{kg}\) for options (a) and (b), respectively.

## 4 Momentum Resolution

The momentum resolution was estimated in [1] for \(B=0.57\ \mathrm{T}\). For our estimation \(B=0.3\ \mathrm{T}\) was assumed. The other parameters affecting the momentum resolution (\(L\), the length of the magnet; \(\lambda\), the width of the silicon tracker strips; \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\), the thickness of the middle silicon detector) the same values as in [1] were used, they are listed in Table 2.

The resolution of MUST, as long as multiple scattering is neglected, is defined by the formula (see [1])

\[\frac{\delta p_{coord}}{p}\simeq\frac{2\sqrt{2}}{.3B}\cdot\frac{\lambda}{L^{2} },p \tag{7}\]

if the units of length, momentum and B-field strength are m, GeV/c and T, respectively. This units will be assumed in the subsequent formulas too.

With the values of Table 1 this leads to

\[\frac{\delta p_{coord}}{p}\simeq.109\%\cdot p \tag{8}\]

The dispersion of the sagitta owing to multiple scattering in the middle plane of the tracker is:

\[\delta s_{m}\approx\theta_{m}\cdot\frac{L}{4}, \tag{9}\]

where the rms value of the scattering angle \(\theta_{m}\), depends on the ratio \(x/X_{0}\) (For silicon \(X_{0}=9.36\) cm)

\[\theta_{m}\approx\frac{.0136}{p}\sqrt{x/X_{0}}. \tag{10}\]

The sagitta is in a constant field B is given by:

\[s\approx\frac{0.3B}{8}\cdot\frac{L^{2}}{p} \tag{11}\]

From (11)

\[\frac{\delta p_{m}}{p}\simeq\frac{\delta s_{m}}{s} \tag{12}\]

Substituting (9), (10) to (12) we obtain

\[\frac{\delta p_{m}}{p}\simeq\frac{.091}{BL}\cdot\sqrt{x/X_{0}}. \tag{13}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Parameters & Values \\ \hline B & \(.3\) T \\ \hline \(L\) & \(1.2\) m \\ \hline \(\lambda\) & \(50\)\(\mu\)m \\ \hline \(x_{1}\) & \(300\)\(\mu\)m \\ \(x_{2}\) & \(600\)\(\mu\)m \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Values of MUST parameters affecting the momentum resolution For a silicon wafer thickness of 300\(\mu\)m this leads to

\[\frac{\delta p_{m*}}{p}\simeq 1.4\ \%, \tag{14}\]

and for a 600\(\mu\)m thick wafer

\[\frac{\delta p_{m*}}{p}\simeq 2.0\ \%. \tag{15}\]

The dependence of the MUST resolution on the value of muon momenta for the different options is shown in Figure 4. For the particles with momentum less than 20 GeV/c, which provide for the predominant fraction of the muon trigger rate, typical values of

\[\frac{\delta p_{tot}}{p}=\frac{\sqrt{\delta p_{coord}^{2}+\delta p_{m*}^{2}}}{p }\simeq 1.5-2.5\ \% \tag{16}\]

can be achieved.

The resolution of the ATLAS muon system in this momentum interval is also 1.5 - 2 % [3].

For the calibration of the muon alignment system MUST has to provide for an unbiased measurement of the particle momentum independent of the same particle momentum measurement by the muon system itself.

For this calibration procedure momentum resolution of MUST does not have to be much better than the muon system momentum resolution, because the amount of statistics needed for the calibration will be defined by the worse, in this case the ATLAS Muon System, resolution.

It to a conclusion that the MUST momentum resolution (16) is sufficient for the purposes of the Muon System calibration.

## 5 Muon Rates

A Monte Carlo simulation of particle rates in the muon chambers of ATLAS was described in [4]. All events were generated using ISAJET. As it was stated by the authors in the conclusion: "The dominant rates come from decays of hadrons in flight before they reach the calorimeter and for transverse momenta below 5 GeV/c. Above this value, the dominant rate comes from b quark decays".

Recent measurements of b quark inclusive cross sections at TEVATRON energies by the CDF and D0 collaborations show, that the ISAJET predictions for these values were too low by approximately a factor two.

The ISAJET data [4] will be used here as a conservative lower limit for an evaluation of the particle rates through the MUST aperture.

A general feature of integral inclusive cross sections \(\sigma_{inel}(P_{T}>P_{T}^{th})\) is that in the momentum interval 5 GeV/c\(<P_{T}^{th}<\)20 GeV/c the cross sections hardly depend on the value of pseudorapidity \(\eta\).

In the following we will assume that the flux of particles with momentum above the threshold value \(P_{T}^{th}\) is uniform in \(\eta\) and in \(\phi\).

For the pseudorapidity interval \(|\eta|<2.5\) the following values for the cross sections were obtained in [4]:

\[\sigma_{inel}(P_{T}>6\ {\rm GeV}/{\rm c})=4\cdot 10^{-3}\ {\rm mb}, \tag{17}\]

and

\[\sigma_{inel}(P_{T}>20\ {\rm GeV}/{\rm c})=2\cdot 10^{-4}\ {\rm mb}. \tag{18}\]

It means that for a luminosity \(L=10^{33}\ {\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}=10^{6}\ {\rm mb}^{-1}{\rm s}^{-1}\) the total particle rates in the barrel (\(|\eta|<1\)) are

\[R_{barrel}(P_{T}>6\ {\rm GeV}/{\rm c})=4\cdot 10^{-3}\ {\rm mb}\cdot 10^{6}\ {\rm mb}^{-1}{\rm s}^{-1}\cdot\frac{1}{2.5}=1.6\cdot 1 0^{3}\ {\rm s}^{-1}, \tag{19}\]

and

\[R_{barrel}(P_{T}>20\ {\rm GeV}/{\rm c})=2\cdot 10^{-4}\ {\rm mb}\cdot 10^{6}\ {\rm mb}^{-1}{\rm s}^{-1}\cdot\frac{1}{2.5}=80\ {\rm s}^{-1}, \tag{20}\]

and in the end-caps (\(1<|\eta|<2.5\))

\[R_{end-caps}(P_{T}>6\ {\rm GeV}/{\rm c})=4\cdot 10^{-3}\ {\rm mb}\cdot 10^{6}\ {\rm mb}^{-1}{\rm s}^{-1}\cdot\frac{1.5}{2.5}=2.4\cdot 1 0^{3}\ {\rm s}^{-1}, \tag{21}\]

and

\[R_{end-caps}(P_{T}>20\ {\rm GeV}/{\rm c})=2\cdot 10^{-4}\ {\rm mb}\cdot 10^{6} \ {\rm mb}^{-1}{\rm s}^{-1}\cdot\frac{1.5}{2.5}=120\ {\rm s}^{-1}, \tag{22}\]

The area of the barrel outer surface (where MUST could be placed) is

\[S_{barrel}=2\pi\cdot r_{outer}\cdot l_{outer}\approx 2\pi\cdot 10\ {\rm m}\cdot 25\ {\rm m}\approx 1500\ {\rm m}^{2}. \tag{23}\]

The area of the end-cap middle layers is

\[S_{end-caps}=\pi\cdot r_{end-cap}^{2}\cdot 2=\pi\cdot 10^{2}\ {\rm m}^{2}\cdot 2 \approx 600\ {\rm m}^{2}. \tag{24}\]

Muon rates through the MUST cross-section \(S_{MUST}\) are equal to

\[R_{MUST}=R_{barrel/end-caps}\cdot\frac{S_{MUST}\cdot\ \varepsilon_{eff}}{S_{ barrel/end-caps}}. \tag{25}\]

The results of with the assumptions (17) - (25) are shown in Table 3.

A sagitta calibration at the level of 30 \(\mu\)m requires about 400 muons with \(P_{T}>20\ {\rm GeV}/{\rm c}\) or 4000 muons with \(P_{T}>6\ {\rm GeV}/{\rm c}\). This corresponds to 30 - 40 hours of data taking in the barrel and 10 - 15 hours in the end-caps. Each large sector of the ATLAS barrel spectrometer has 6 logical alignment towers, which have to be calibrated individually with MUST. So, the total number of the logical towers is \(6\times 8=48\). It means that with one MUST spectrometer the barrel part of the muon system would be calibrated in 3 - 4 months of regular data taking. The calibration of the end-caps takes less time.

When LHC will reach the nominal luminosity of \(L=10^{34}\ {\rm cm}^{-2}{\rm s}^{-1}\) the time required for the calibration of the ATLAS Muon System will be 1 - 2 weeks.

## 6 Calibration Procedure

To calibrate the ATLAS Muon System with 30 \(\mu\)m accuracy MUST itself has to be very well calibrated (in average: 0.1% for 20 GeV muons [1]). For the internal MUST the value of field strength of 0.57 T was assumed, and with this assumption MUST had to be aligned to 1.5 - 2 \(\mu\)m [5].

For the external MUST option with twice less value of field strength \(B=.3\) T and the same lever-arm of 1.2 m this figure goes down to 1\(\mu\)m.

The value strength of the B-field has to be controlled at the 0.1% level.

To reach an internal alignment accuracy of a few microns and the magnetic field measurement with 0.1% resolution MUST with a permanent magnet has to be calibrated in a test beam.

On the other hand, we can use the portability of the external MUST to avoid these rather challenging requirements.

Namely, if a half of track statistics is collected with the initial MUST orientation, and the other half - with the reversed one, the major part of the momentum systematic error due to the MUST tracker misalignment will be canceled.

Performance of this procedure depends on two factors: the value of the internal misalignment of the MUST silicon tracker, and the accuracy of the MUST reversed positioning w.r.t. the initial one. MonteCarlo simulations show that to reach less than 1 \(\mu\)m systematic error with the tracker internal misalignment of 100 \(\mu\)m, the relative positioning accuracy of 10 mrad is required. If the value of the MUST tracker misalignment is of 10 \(\mu\)m, the positioning requirement can be softened to 100 mrad, which looks feasible even without special support structure.

## 7 Interference with the ATLAS muon system

MUST with a permanent magnet placed in the space between the Middle and the Outer end-cap layers could be used for the calibration of all chamber towers in the transition and in the end-cap regions. The distance between the Middle and the Outer chambers is about 6 - 7 m, and this space is to a large extent free of any supports and services. Thus, even spectrometer with a level-arm much longer than 1.2 m could be placed there.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline \multirow{2}{*}{Magnet option} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{Barrel} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{End-Caps} \\ \cline{2-5}  & \(P_{\tau}>6\) GeV/c & \(P_{\tau}>20\) GeV/e & \(P_{\tau}>6\) GeV/c & \(P_{\tau}>20\) GeV/c \\ \hline (a) \(r_{inn}\)=15 cm & 135 & 7 & 500 & 25 \\ \hline (b) \(r_{inn}\)=20 cm & 230 & 12 & 850 & 42 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Number of muons crossing the MUST aperture per hourIn the barrel region MUST can be used everywhere outside of the muon system except for the "6 o'clock" sector.

The important feature of MUST with a permanent magnet is that it does not interfere with thelay-out of the ATLAS Muon System, because it can be mounted outside the barrel region and in that part of the forward region, which is anyway empty.

A device of the size and the weight of MUST can be easily transported with a crane.

It should be point out, that MUST with a permanent magnet does not need any support structure for the precise mounting w.r.t. the ATLAS Muon System:

* a precise placement of MUST w.r.t. the magnetic field of the muon spectrometer is not required, because MUST has its own B-field.
* Matching of a track registered by MUST and a track in the muon system is easy given the very low particle rates.

For the same reasonst there are no stability requirements for the MUST positioning w.r.t. the muon system. The MUST tracker has to be stable only relative to the MUST magnet.

The MUST magnetic field does not affect a particle trajectory in the barrel. In the end-caps the \(\int Bdl\) of the MUST magnet has to be accounted for in the momentum reconstruction procedure of the ATLAS Muon System. As an option, the direction of the MUST magnetic field can be oriented orthogonally to the end-cap toroid magnetic field, in this case only "non-bend" coordinate of a trajectory will be affected.

Effect of the fringe field of the ATLAS muon system on the MUST magnet can be avoided, if the MUST magnet will have a small magnetic dipole moment. For example, the AMS permanent magnet (which has to come up to very strict NASA requirements) has virtually zero magnetic dipole moment [2].

## 8 Conclusions

The new concept of MUST with a permanent magnet has the following basic features:

* it can be used everywhere in the barrel and in the end-caps (except the "6 o'clock" barrel sector);
* it is portable with a crane and it does not require any special support structure;
* it does not interfere with the ATLAS Muon System lay-out;* a permanent magnet made of modern magnetic materials is feasible. The weight of such magnet is a few hundred kilograms, and its cost is comparable to the cost of the silicon tracker;
	* 2.5 %, which is adequate for the muon system calibration.

The estimation of the muon rates crossing the MUST aperture shows, that the barrel region can be calibrated in 3 - 4 months of regular data taking at a luminosity \(L=10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The time needed for the calibration of the end-caps is several times less.
