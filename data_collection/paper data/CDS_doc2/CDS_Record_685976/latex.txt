**Development plan for the cooling of the End Cap TRT in ATLAS**

By B. Rikard Gebart, CERN PPE/ATE

Summary

The development plan for the cooling of the ATLAS End cap TRT is discussed and outlined. Some of the critical problems that need to be addressed are also summarised.

The proposed cooling method is to use dry gas (CO\({}_{\rm J}\)) as primary cooling media for the straws in the detector. The cooling gas is passed radially outwards in each wheel to transport the heat away from the straws. The gas is thereby heated by a controllable amount (how much depends on the flow rate).

The gas is subsequently passed through a gas-to-liquid heat exchanger where the gas temperature is brought back to the nominal value so it can be used to cool the next wheel.

The development of the cooling starts with an initial phase with mostly theoretical analysis for a first iteration in the optimisation process. In parallel with this a first set of drawings will be produced. The theoretical phase is followed by an experimental optimisation iteration which will also be used as a validation of the design.

## 1 Introduction

The following note outlines the strategy for the development of a cooling system for the end cap TRT detector. The goal is to have a validated cooling design well before the Technical Design Report is to be written during the fall -96. The purpose of the present paper is to communicate quickly to all interested parties how the development project is planned to be run. No attempt is made at discussing all possible solutions in detail, the emphasis is instead on the concept that has emerged during discussions with many people during the last few months. It is felt that this note is far from perfect but that it is necessary to produce a basis for discussions as soon as possible.

Preliminary estimates of the heating of the end caps of the inner detector by discharges in the straws have shown that active cooling is necessary to get an acceptable temperature uniformity [1, 4].

Additional papers that are useful as a background to the present problem discusses the cooling of the barrel TRT [2, 3] The present note summarises some of the background to the problem, discusses some of the available options and outlines a strategy for the development of a working cooling system.

The basic facts of the problem are given in Section 2, the various options for cooling are given and discussed in Section 3, the proposed cooling alternative is described in Section 4 and finally the development project for the cooling is outlined in Section 5.

## 2 Facts about the end caps

The end caps consist of three different types of wheels with about 320,000 straws in a total of 36 wheels, 18 on each side of the barrel TRT. The details about the wheels are summarised in Table 1.

The estimated total heat dissipation in the end caps (electronics not included) is about 3 kW based on the assumption of a dissipation of 9 mW/straw [1]. This in itself is not a very large number but in combination with the poor average thermal conductivity and limited convection contribution in the end caps it can lead to high temperatures.

The resulting dissipation rates per wheel and the necessary flow rates to remove this heat can be computed if the cooling gas properties and the dissipation rate per straw are known. If one assumes a dissipation rate of 9 mW/straw and that CO\({}_{2}\) is the cooling gas the following result is obtained:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c} \hline \hline \multicolumn{1}{c}{**Wheel type**} & \# straws & Heat diss. & Flow rate & Mass flow \\  & & (W) & (m\({}^{3}\)/s) & (kg/s) \\ \hline A & 12288 & 110,6 & 0,0068 & 0,0135 \\ B & 6144 & 55,3 & 0,0034 & 0,0067 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Characteristics of the end caps (data from Morges meeting 950712 compiled by Hauviller and Danielsson, CERN/ATLAS)The following data is assumed for the N\({}_{2}\), CO\({}_{2}\) and Xe:

\begin{tabular}{l|r r r} \hline Gas Properties & \(N_{2}\) & CO\({}_{2}\) & Xe \\ \hline \(p\) (kg/m\({}^{3}\)) & 1,25 & 1.98 & 5.89 \\ Specific heat (J/kg/C) & 1040 & 820 & 160 \\ Thermal conductivity (W/m/C) & 0,024 & 0.014 & 0.0052 \\ Viscosity (10\({}^{6}\) Pas) & 16.7 & 13.9 & 22.6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The dimensions of the end caps are shown graphically in Figure 1.

The wheels are of 3 different types and are collected in 3 groups. The groups are separated by about 4 cm and this space will be used to some extent for supports and services to the SCT. The wheels in each group are separated by about 3 mm, in addition the first straw layer is positioned 3 mm inside the outer edge of the rim of the wheel. This means that the outer straw planes of two neighbouring wheels are separated by a distance of about 9 mm. Some of this distance will be filled with radiator material.

The TRT surrounds a Semi Conductor Tracker (SCT). The SCT will be cooled to about -5\({}^{\circ}\)C and is enclosed in thermal insulation. However, the SCT will be felt as a cold surface seen from the TRT point of view.

## 3 Cooling options

The available options for cooling of the wheels are:

- only natural convection in the space outside the straws

- forced convection inside straws

- forced convection outside straws

- natural convection loops inside straws

- other (Peltier elements, etc.)

Natural convection only on the outside of the straws is severely restricted by the radiator sheets and

the straws themselves. Numerical simulations have shown that the temperatures will become very high [4]. The present understanding is that this option is impossible to use. More space between the

layers of straws would improve the situation but is probably out of the question due to detector

performance reasons.

Forced convection inside the straws is one possibility since there is already a small gas flow of

chamber gas (Xe) there. The Xe is circulated through the straws at a low flow rate to remove any

contamination that will disturb the operation of the detector. One possibility to remove the heat is to

use this gas flow for the transport. If one requires the temperature rise of the gas inside the straws to

be below some target temperature \(\Delta\)T, the necessary mass flow rate is obtained from:

\[\dot{m}=\frac{q}{c\Delta T} \tag{1}\]

q = heating power per straw [W]

c = specific heat of gas [J/kg C]

\(\Delta\)T = temperature rise in straw [\({}^{\circ}\)C]

For a target temperature of 10\({}^{\circ}\)C with Xenon gas the necessary mass flow rate is 5.6 mg/s which

corresponds to a gas velocity in the straws of about 8 cm/s at atmospheric pressure (p = 5.89 kg/m\({}^{3}\);

the gas is not pure Xe but the values for Xe are used in the estimate, c = 160 J/kg\({}^{\circ}\)C, straw inner

diameter = 4 mm). Assuming a "once through" flow arrangement for all straws, this corresponds to a

total mass flow rate of 1.8 kg/s or a volumetric flow rate of 306 l/s at atmospheric pressure.

The mass flow in itself may not sound like a serious problem but there are a number of other reasons

not to chose this option. The first problem is that it would be difficult to clean the gas on-line with this

flow rate. The second problem is that it is difficult to create sufficient pumping capacity under clean

conditions [5]. One possibility for a reduction of the flow rate would be to connect groups of straws in

series but this would then complicate the design significantly and would necessitate the co-ordination

of many independent activities (which in itself would be difficult). Hence, the option with cooling

with the chamber gas is discarded.

Forced convection outside the straws is a less direct way of removing heat than to force cool gas

directly through the straws. However, one advantage of this method is that it is relatively easy to

 imagine a practical way of introducing the cooling gas around the straws and a method for transport

of heat out of the detector. At the same time it appears that the impact on the detector performance

from this alternative is relatively small (a small amount of extra material at the outer radius and

minor changes elsewhere). An additional attractive feature with this option is that it can be designed

and constructed almost independently of other TRT end cap activities which reduces the complexity of

co-ordination.

A uniform radial flow can be obtained with a manifold at the first wheel in a series and by suitable

geometrical arrangement of the radiator material in all wheels. At the outer radius, but inside the

electronics, the flow can again be forced inwards in the "crack" between the wheels where a heat

exchanger is placed. Different options are possible for the connection of wheels (series or parallel).

Rough estimates of pressure drops and heat transfer coefficients indicate that the design is feasible.

_Thus, this is the preferred design_.

Natural convection cooling inside the straws is an interesting alternative that eliminates the need for bulky feed ducts. However, to make this method efficient it is necessary to create closed loops with sufficient net driving force. One way of achieving this is illustrated in Figure 2 where two loops are indicated. In practice every loop would consist of a group of straws connected to each other in parallel.

The heat produced within the straws is convected to the outer rim where it can be transferred to a water cooling system via a heat exchanger. An initial experimental study has been made of this option [6] but edge effects made it difficult to determine if the method is feasible. In addition, the method will involve complicated geometrical solutions for the flow layout and the heat exchangers. As a conclusion it is felt that although this option is elegant it is at the same time less safe than the forced convection alternative.

Among other solutions that can be imagined one must mention the use of Peltier elements that use the thermoelectric effect to create low temperature surfaces. However, this technique is expensive and involves more material than the other alternatives discussed above and it is thus discarded. A possible cooling with an imposed oscillating flow inside the straws has also been investigated but the results were inconclusive due to experimental difficulties [7].

## 4 Selected alternative for the cooling of the TRT wheels

An acceptable cooling with little additional material can be obtained with a radial flow between the straws of the wheel (see Figure 3). The cooling gas can be either CO\({}_{2}\) or N\({}_{2}\) but the former alternative is preferred due to severe difficulties with cleaning of the detector gas if N\({}_{2}\) leaks into the straw volume. However, there is a safety problem with CO\({}_{2}\) (it is heavy and can accumulate in lower compartments in the experimental cavern) and possible problems connected to radiation hardness [8] (free radicals created from CO\({}_{2}\) by radiation are suspected to attack polymeric materials, work is under way to investigate the problem).

Several possibilities exist for the grouping of wheels but the working hypothesis is to group the wheels according to the existing grouping, i.e. in three groups on each side of the barrel TRT (see Figure 1). The following components need special attention in the development of the cooling concept:

1. "Plumbing" for the gas services. Tubing into the detector must be dimensioned and positioned.
2. Flow manifold. This is a circular flow distributor that is fed with a single tube at one point and which distributes the flow uniformly around the inner radius of a wheel and ejects it in the axial direction. This piece is connected to the first wheel in a series of wheels to ensure a uniform gas flow there. A possible variation on this theme is to place the manifold at the outer radius and send the flow inwards in a "crack".
3. Layout of radiator sheets and separating walls in the wheels to obtain uniform flow distribution with an axial inlet at the inner radius and an axial outlet at the outer radius.
4. Connections between the wheels so that the flow that leaves one wheel at the outer radius is forced radially inwards and into the next wheel.
5. Heat exchanger in the space between wheels in a group of wheels. This will most likely be in the shape of a honeycomb made from thin sheet metal (or possibly high thermal conductivity carbon fibre composite). The metal parts are cooled by water that circulates in a tube that is welded to the honeycomb. The goal is to maximise the heat transfer area per unit volume and at the same time to minimise the total mass of the heat exchanger. A possible variation is to use the rim of the wheel as cooling surface. It has then to be investigated if the thermal conductivity of the carbon fibre is high enough and that the heat can be transferred to a liquid medium in a practical way.
6. Reservation of space for the return gas flow. The plan today is to let the return gas flow find its own way out from the detector but it is important that the space is reserved to make sure that it is available. It is also possible that a closed return duct is provided due to requirements for Xe recovery from the cooling gas. However, this will then complicate the design significantly.
7. "Plumbing" for the cooling liquid services. The cooling liquid must be brought in and out of the detector, the T-pieces for the various branches must be located and dimensioned, etc.

Additional problems to keep in mind during the development:

Figure 3: Outline sketch of the cooling concept for the TRT wheels.

* Influence of radiator material in wheel. At present not clear if it is going to be a plastic sheet or porous material. If it is a porous material it would perhaps be a good idea to add one impermeable plastic sheet for flow guidance.
* Harmonisation with other sub-systems (SCT and cryostat mainly).
* Influence from cold surface of SCT-detector.
* Collection of return gas flow and handling of leaks in gas system.
* Condensation on cold surfaces.
* Dust transport and accumulation in the system.
* Safety problems connected to the use of a heavy gas (CO\({}_{2}\)) that can accumulate in closed volumes.
* Possible impact on radiation hardness from CO\({}_{2}\).

## 5 Outline of development project

The problem will be studied with successive refinement starting with rough estimates based on handbook formulas. These estimates will be followed by numerical simulations to obtain a first optimisation iteration. The heat exchangers will be optimised with a theoretical analysis that will be followed by an experimental program that will further optimise the design and finally validate the design.

The design will be documented with detailed drawings that will be refined in parallel with the rest of the program. The validation of the design relies partly on mock-up experiments in Dubna.

A proposal for a project plan is shown in Figure 4 where the tasks that can be performed in parallel are shown. The starting time and duration of each task should be taken as rough estimates only since this plan was constructed at an early stage without consultation with all parties involved.
