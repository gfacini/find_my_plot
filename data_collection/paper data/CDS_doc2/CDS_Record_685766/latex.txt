**Abstract**

In this note we study possibilities of improving performance of pressurized cylindrical drift tubes by adding fieldforming wires. The PDT designs with 2, 4 and 6 fieldforming wires were studied. The 6-wire PDT is shown to have essential advantages over the traditional design.

Introduction

Pressurized cylindrical drift tubes (PDT) are a promising detector for muon systems to be used in experimental set-ups of the next generation at future colliders. For example, the possibility of using PDT is considered by the ATLAS project at the LHC [1].

The advantages of the PDT are a high coordinate resolution (better than 50 \(\mu\)m for an individual PDT 3 cm in diameter at a pressure of 3 atm [2]), s simple design, a low cost, feasible mass production (a muon tracking system of ATLAS would require about 300 000 drift tubes).

However, drift tubes have some disadvantages, among them limitation on the maximum diameter of the tube.

Increasing the diameter of the tube (which results in lower cost of the detector owing to a smaller total number of PDT and electronic channels) we deteriorate drift characteristics of the detector, namely the dependence of the electron drift time on the particle path becomes less linear from the distance and the maximum collection time increases to an intolerable value.

In ref. [3] the above disadvantages were avoided by forming an electric field in the PDT by means of additional electrodes (fig. 1). The results were good, but these massive inside electrodes increase the amount of material in muon system detectors, which results in poorer momentum resolution due to higher multiple scattering at medium momentum range. A way to reduce the amount of material in PDT with electrodes is to use the additional field shaping wires.

The purpose of this paper was to study a possibility of making PDT with field-forming wires.

## 2 Simulation results

The search for an optimum design of a detector with additional wires was carried out by means of a standard package GARFIELD [4].

The PDT diameter was increased to 5 cm (in the ATLAS Letter of Intent [1] was proposed to use PDT at 2-3 cm diameter).

Simulation was aimed at designing a PDT to meet the following requirements:

* sensitive volume from which primary electrons drift to the signal wire must be a narrow strip (within the cross section of the tube);
* working voltage must not exceed 10 kV to diminish technical problems in detector operation;
* electric field strength near the signal wire must be chosen to operate in the proportional mode;* field strength in the drift region must be more than 1000 V/cm at atmospheric pressure thus the drift velocity for the chosen gas mixture is saturated (fig. 2);
* if the electric potentials for the signal and fieldshaping wires could be chosen equal, the design of the PDT's would be clearly more easy.

The PDT operation mode depends on the field strength in the close proximity to the wire. The necessary value of the field strength can be obtained from the experimental data on operation of a standard tube (tube diameter 52 mm, signal wire diameter 50 \(\mu\)m, no additional wires). A drift tube of this design filled with a gas mixture of \(Ar-CO_{2}-isoC_{4}H_{10}\) (79-14.5-6.5) at atmospheric pressure operated in proportional mode at a voltage of 2.7-3.1 kV. Calculation shows that the electric field strength is 115-120 kV/cm at a distance of 10 \(\mu\)m from wire. These values were taken as a basis for further calculations.

The diameter of potential wires was chosen to be quite large - 100 \(\mu\)m for a couple of reasons (mechanical strength, necessity of decreasing the gas gain on the potential wires).

### Various configurations of wires

Tubes with two, four and six additional wires were considered as possible designs. In accordance with the above requirements, the optimum wire arrangement and voltage were selected for each design. In fig. 3a-d there are drift lines for the designs that meet all requirements. Already with two additional wires the drift region considerably changed, and with 6 wires it looked like a strip about 1cm wide. The working voltage corresponding to this field pattern is 3.7, 4.4 and 4.8 kV for the designs with 2, 4 and 6 additional wires. Plots of electric field strength in the drift region are given in fig4a-d for all tube designs. A PDT with two additional wires could meet the requirement of the saturate drift velocity at atmospheric pressure only in a small part of the drift region (\(\sim\)20%), a PDT with 4 additional wires meets this requirement in \(\sim\)70% of the region, while a PDT with 6 additional wires does it practically in the whole sensitive volume.

A design with 2 additional wires is the simplest for fabrication because it has all internal wires lying in the same plane, but the field configuration allowed by this design is far from the optimum. A design with 4 additional wires is technologically more complicated, but design complications in changing from 4 to 6 wires seem to be insignificant. Taking into account this consideration and the fact that a PDT with 6 additional wires allows a practically ideal electric field configuration for a drift detector, we accepted it as the optimum design.

Experimental data

To check the simulation results a PDT with 6 additional wires was fabricated and tested. The prototype detector had the following dimensions: the outer diameter of the aluminum tube is 52 mm, walls are 1 mm thick, the tube is 30 cm long, the diameter of a signal wire is 50 \(\mu\)m, the diameter of a potential wire is 100 \(\mu\)m. The potential wires are placed on the 13-mm radius, as shown in fig. 3d. In fig. 5 there are the results of measuring the dependence of the drift time on the coordinate at the atmospheric pressure for the gas mixture \(Ar-CO_{2}-isoC_{4}H_{10}\) (79-14.5-6.5). For a tube with 6 wires this dependence is very close to the linear one and seems to be much better than for the standard design, the maximum drift time decreasing by a factor of 2.5 and being below 500 ns.

Besides, measurements were carried out with the gas mixture \(Ar-CO_{2}-isoC_{4}H_{10}\) (81.5-15.3) at a pressure of 3 atm (abs) (fig. 6). As seen from the figure, dependence of the drift time on the particle drift distance is also practically a linear one and the maximum drift time for a tube with diameter 50mm is about 600 ns well in the range of the ATLAS specification. Resolution measurements are under way.

## 4 Conclusion

A possibility of improving performance of pressurized drift tubes was studied in this paper. Using computer simulation we investigated PDT designs with 2, 4 and 6 additional wires, and the 6-wire design is found to be the best. According to calculations, this detector has some essential advantages over the traditional design:

* linearity of drift time dependence on the coordinate;
* maximum charge collection time approximately half as long as that of the standard PDT.

It allows one to make a PDT 50 mm in diameter whose performance is essentially better than that of a standard PDT 30 mm in diameter. An increase in the PDT diameter from 3 cm to 5 cm allows almost 2-fold reduction in the number of muon system channels.

To check the simulation results a PDT 50 mm in diameter with 6 additional wires was fabricated and tested. The experimental results are in good agreement with the calculations.

The data obtained allow one to state that performance of this PDT design meets basic requirements for a coordinate detector of the muon system to be used at ATLAS LHC.
