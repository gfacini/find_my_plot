**Abstract**

At the.recent RPC workshop in Pavia it was suggested that the optimization of RPC chambers has to be understood better. In order to assist this process a MC simulation taking into account the basic processes relevant for RPC chamber charge and signal production has been started. This note describes the assumptions upon which the simulation is based and gives a first comparison of the simulation with available data. In addition, all necessary information for further development and for usage of the code is given in the appendix.

1. Introduction

Resistive plate chamber detectors have been developed since the early 1980s [1,2]. The chamber consists of two parallel plates which enclose the sensitive gas volume. The plates are made of a material with high resistivity, usually in the order of \(10^{11}\)\(\Omega\) cm. By applying a voltage of a few 10 kV/cm, a constant and uniform electric field is created across the whole gap due to which any primary ionization starts an immediate avalanche production. The RPCs are well known for their excellent time resolution of a few ns.

In the early days, the resistive plate chambers have been operated in spark mode. However, this mode is not suitable for the high particle rate operation necessary for future experiments. Therefore, the chambers are operated in proportional mode nowadays, requiring more sophisticated readout electronics due to smaller signal amplitudes.

## 2 Basic assumptions and simulation parameters

In order to get an estimate of RPC behavior under varying conditions, there are only a few basic effects which have to be considered for a simple drift chamber geometry as an RPC.

The main evaluation criteria for RPCs is their efficiency and their time resolution. Both effects depend on the number of primary ionization clusters in the gas gap and on the gas amplification factor which itself depends on the applied electric field and on the first Townsend coefficient at that reduced field E/p for the used gas mixture.

The efficiency of an RPC can be evaluated for a specified charge threshold for different gap widths and applied electric fields, giving a full understanding of the behavior in one two-dimensional plot. It is evident, that either the applied electric field E/p or the first Townsend coefficient \(\alpha\) can be used to parametrize the gas amplification factor.

Information on how to run the simulation is given in the appendix, here we focus on the used concepts.

### Number of primary ionization clusters

Assuming that the energy of the charged particle passing through matter is much larger than the average energy lost in collisions with gas, the distance between two such encounters is independent of the distance between any previous encounters. Hence, the number of primary ionization clusters (PIC) per unit length produced by a minimum ionizing charged particle passing through matter is Poisson distributed and the spatial distance between two PIC is exponentially distributed, following

\[f(x)=e^{-\overrightarrow{n}},\]

where \(\overrightarrow{n}\) is the average number of PIC per unit length.

For many gases the number of PIC per unit length for minimum ionizing particles is readily available in literature1.

Footnote 1: When putting the number of PIC per unit length into the simulation, one has to rescale the literature value, which is usually given for minimum ionizing particles, to the energies of the particles for which the detector is supposed to work. For relativistic particles, a rescaling with the factor 1.5 was used in this simulation.

However, for gases, which have not widely been used in particle detectors so far, no such measurements are available. This is the case for almost all Freon gases which are presently used in the construction of resistive plate chamber. For those gases one can approximate the specific number of primary ionization events per unit length in a gas at normal condition with their average atomic number scaled with a constant, as suggested by Sault in [3]. This approach is in reasonably good agreement with data for most gases, one of the exceptions being Xenon.

If a multicomponent gas is used, one deducts the PIC value by simply adding the PIC values for each component weighted with its contribution factor to the mixture.

### Cluster size distribution

In the primary collision process between the passing charged particle and a gas molecule, the ejected electron can have enough energy to itself ionize other gas molecules, producing secondary electron-ion pairs. The number of electron-ion pairs which are produced in one primary ionization cluster is described by the cluster size probability distribution. Few data for this distribution in different gas mixtures exist. However, this distribution should not be too different in various gas mixtures. Therefore, we have used the cluster size distribution measured for argon by Fischle et al. [4] throughout the studies described. The measured distribution was extended up to cluster sizes of 1000 electrons, assuming a 1/n\({}^{2}\) dependence of the probability for large n.

### Electron amplification - the first Townsend coefficient and the gas gain

The primary ionization starts a multiplication process in the high constant electric field in between the two parallel plates. This signal amplification is an exponential process, following

\[n(d)=n_{0}\cdot e^{\alpha t}\,,\]

\(n_{0}\) being the number of electron-ion pairs present at time \(t_{0}\) and n is the number of electron-ion pairs present in the gap after the primary electron-ion pairs have traveled a distance d within the electric field. \(\alpha\) denotes the first Townsend coefficient which is the inverse of the mean free path length and therefore specific for a certain gas and the applied electric field E/p.

For widely used gases and gas mixtures, the first Townsend coefficient has been measured for a range of E/p values. However, for the high electric fields and for the specific gases used in RPC detectors, the Townsend coefficient is usually not available.

In such cases, \(\alpha\) can either be approximated with values from similar gases or extracted from the data with the help of an MC. An illustration of the latter will be given in section 3.

### Gas gain fluctuation

For the studies described in this work, we have assumed an exponential distribution of the gas gain variations. The gas gain fluctuation is considered for the avalanche started by one whole PIC, regardless of the spatial distribution of the primary electrons \(n_{0}\) within the cluster. In addition, avalanches from consequent PICs are treated as fully independent, regardless of their distance in space.

This is assumed to be a good first order approximation. However, a better approximation could consider space charge effects.

The gas gain fluctuation is simulated by varying n, the total number of electrons produced in the avalanche up to the anode, according to an exponential distribution. This effectively corresponds to a first Townsend coefficient \(\alpha^{*}\) which can be obtained from

\[\alpha^{*}=\ln\left(\frac{n}{n_{0}}\right)\frac{1}{d},\]

if d is the orthogonal distance between the anode and the space where the PIC has been created.

#### Electron attachment

For electronegative gases, like Freon, there is a certain probability that an electron, instead of continuing the multiplication process, is captured by an electronegative gas molecule. One can view this effect as a lower overall gain and can express this by replacing the first Townsend coefficient \(\alpha\) by the effective Townsend coefficient \(\alpha^{*}=\alpha\cdot\eta\), where \(\eta\) is the attachment coefficient.

The attachment coefficient \(\eta\) only takes into account losses of electrons during the avalanche production process. However, electronegative gas molecules can also capture primary electrons preventing either a part of the avalanche or the full avalanche to be even started. The MC considers this effect by allowing for a user specified fraction of the PIC electrons \(n_{0}\) to be captured before any amplification is simulated.

Nevertheless, this is only a very crude approximation of the real (and much more complex) avalanche production process.

### The fast electron signal

For the use at the LHC, the RPCs have to be capable of high speed readout. Therefore, only the fast signal which is induced by the movement of the electrons produced in the avalanche is recorded.

It can be shown that the charge induced by the movement of the avalanche towards the anode started by one electron at a distance d from the anode is given by

\[q=\frac{e}{\alpha d}e^{\alpha d}.\]

Using this formula, the fast charge signal from electrons is Q=n\({}_{0}\)q, with \(n_{0}\) being the number of primary electrons in a PIC. Thus, all primary electrons per cluster are assumed to be produced at the same location within the gap and are assumed to have the same amplification and fluctuation process.

## 3 Comparison of the MC with RPC data

In order to understand if the simulated effects are correct and sufficient to describe the RPC behavior, a comparison of the simulated charge spectrum with data is undertaken.

Our primary interest here is the understanding of the ATLAS RPC behavior. Those chambers will most likely be operated with a gas mixture consisting mainly of C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{2}\)F\({}_{4}\) which is non flammable and environmentally safe. Tetrafluoroethane is widely used in industry2, however is little studied with respect to its characteristics needed for detector construction. The MC described in this work could help extract those parameters from a data set.

Footnote 2: In industry this gas is known as SUVA\({}_{134}\).

However, to check the simulation it is best to have as few unknown data variables as possible. Therefore, the simulated fast signal charge is compared with data taken by the CERN/LAA group with a 5mm gap RPC, filled with 80% CO\({}_{2}\), 15% Ar, 5% DME and 1% water vapor. The chamber was operated at 14.9kV across the gap, equivalent to an E/p of 29.8 kV/cm Torr. The results of these chamber tests were shown in one of their talks at the Pavia RPC workshop in 1995 [6]. The measured charge spectrum is shown in figure 1.

Even though such gas mixtures are used in detector operation, no measured first Townsend coefficients were available for the E/p range in question. As an approximation, the \(\alpha\) and driftvelocity values obtained from the GARFIELD/MAGBOLTZ driftchamber simulation program are used. Those calculations are quite accurate in regions of lower reduced fields, however are only accurate up to 20 - 30% for higher E/p values3, as in the simulation described here.

Footnote 3: In order to obtain this accuracy in high E/p regions one should use the option ‘first-order ‘iterate-alpha’ with the MAGBOLTZ command line in GARFIELD.

The input parameters used for the simulation are given in table 1.

Figure 1: Spectrum of electron charge induced in an 5 mm gap RPC, filled with 80% CO\({}_{2}\). 15% Ar, 5% DME and 1% water vapor, operated at 14.9 kV across the gap.

A selection of general simulation monitoring histograms are shown in figure 2. Plot a) shows the spectrum of the number of primary ionization clusters produced in the 5mm gap and b) gives the number of electrons per primary ionization cluster.

To extract the first Townsend coefficient from the data, a scan over various input E/p values is performed. No capture of primary electrons is allowed. Figure 3 shows the charge spectrum for a few steps of such a scan.

The simulated charge distribution which reproduces the measured induced charge shape best, gives us information on the first Townsend coefficient. A measure to compare the decreasing slope of the

\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline parameter & value & comment \\ \hline PIC per cm & 53 & estimated using atomic number \\ max. allowed number of \(e^{-}\)per PIC & 1000 & for cluster size distribution \\ percentage of captured prim e\({}^{-}\) & 0\% & \\ threshold & 40 fC & after the preamp with amplification factor 8.25 \\ number of simulated events & 10000 & \\ gap width & 5 mm & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Input parameters used for comparison with CERNLA data.

Figure 2: Simulation monitoring histograms. Plot a) shows the spectrum of the number of PIC produced in the 5 mm gap. Histogram b) gives the number of electrons per PIC.

simulated charge spectrum with the data is the ratio of the number of entries for 1 pC and for 3 pC. Those values are about 24.8, 16, 13 and 7.5 with increasing \(\alpha\) as compared to about 16.25 for the data. Thus, an input Townsend coefficient of about 3.065 (in units of amplification per mm) reproduces the shape of the measured spectrum best.

For that amplification factor, the average induced charge for the simulated spectrum is approximately 1.5 pC which is about a factor 2 smaller than the measured one4.

Footnote 4: Please note that the mean charge value as shown on the data histogram includes ADC channels up to very large depositions whereas the simulations only takes depositions up to 20 pC into the average value.

We would like to point out that the simulation does not fully reproduce the long tail of the measured charge spectrum. This might be due to a too simple treatment of avalanche production. A more realistic one could consider the distance in between two neighboring primary ionization clusters when simulating the multiplication process, treating the two clusters as one if they are very close in space.

Figure 3: Simulated fast signal charge spectrum for E/p = 32.55, 32.6,32.65 and 32.7 which correspond to \(\alpha\) values of 2.995,3.03,3.065 and 3.101 in this gas mixture. Capture of primary electrons is not allowed.

As a summary, figure. 4 shows the two-dimensional evaluation plot for the simulation run with the input parameters given in table1. The plot gives the efficiency for an induced charge signal larger than 40 IC for a number of gap widths and reduced field values E/p. For better readability, contours are drawn connecting the data points with a 50%, a 90% and a 95% efficiency, respectively. One can use this plot either at a fixed gap width and a desired efficiency determining the necessary applied reduced field or one can start from the reduced field and deduce the necessary minimal gap width.

The histogram shows that a 5mm gap RPC with a gas mixture of 80% CO\({}_{2}\), 15% Ar, 5% DME can achieve an efficiency better than 95 % only if the reduced electric field E/p is higher than 32.2 kV/cmTorr which corresponds to an \(\alpha\) of about 2.75.

The simulation is estimated to be accurate to about 20-30%, with uncertainties coming from the following effects:

* relating the first Townsend coefficient \(\alpha\) with the reduced electric field E/p via GARFIELD/MAGBOLTZ
* the scaling which takes into account the density effect on the number of primary ionization clusters per unit length
* the simple avalanche process approximation.

## 4. Summary and conclusion

A simulation of resistive plate chamber characteristics has been started based on a minimal model of relevant effects. The simulated charge spectrum has been compared with data and the order of magnitude of the charge signal could be reproduced.

As a next step one could implement the suggested more complex treatment of the avalanche production and an evaluation of the timing characteristics of an RPC.

## 6 Appendix

### Running the RPC simulation

The program has recently been transferred to the directory /afs/cern.ch/user/s/schuh/public/rpc on the CERNSP UNX cluster. It consists of 4 parts, namely the input parameter file, the simulation code itself, GARFIELD/MAGBOLTZ input gas data and a generic output histogram file.

### The input parameter file

The file is called 'rpc.input' and steers the RPC simulation. The main input parameters are the first Townsend coefficient \(\alpha\), the gap width and the number of primary ionization clusters. Since it is very often necessary to try to extract \(\alpha\) or the number of PIC from the charge spectrum taken for a certain gas mixture, the simulation enables scans over the gap width, \(\alpha\) and E/p. Figure 6 shows a typical set of input parameters for a two-dimensional scan over the gap width (from 4 to 6 mm in steps of 0.5 mm) and the applied electric field E/p (from 32.1 to 32.3 in steps of 0.05).

Figure 6-1 Example for a set of input parameters.

All parameters have to be input in units useful for the RPC simulation, which specifically are mm for distance, bar for pressure, ns for time and pC for charge.

Please note that the scan can only be conducted over a range of either \(\alpha\) or E/p values. This is steered with the minimal value for \(\alpha\). Only if \(\alpha\) is -1., the specified E/p range will control the first Townsend coefficient used for the simulation.

The input file also specifies which GARFIELD data file should be taken for the extraction of the first Townsend coefficient and the drift velocity for a specified E/p. These data points are obtained from running the combined GARFIELD and MAGBOLTZ driftchamber simulation program (see the program manual in ref. [5] for details on running it).

The last two lines in the input parameter file hold the first 19 probability values of the cluster size distribution. The input file enables the user to specify up to how many electrons per cluster should be taken into account. Also, the probability for PIC electrons to be captured before any multiplication is initiated can be chosen in this file.

### The GARFIELD input file

This file holds the Townsend coefficient \(\alpha\), the attachment coefficient \(\eta\), the electron drifvelocity and the lateral and longitudinal diffusion for 20 E/p data points for a chosen gas mature. The interesting parameters are interpolated for a specified input E/p point.

### The simulation code and the output histogram file

The most interesting output plot with D 1000, illustrates the two-dimensional dependence of the efficiency of an RPC, namely versus the gap width and the Townsend coefficient or, equivalently, the applied reduced electric field E/p.

There are several histograms of same interest for each step when scanning over the gap width or the amplification factor. Those general histograms are filled in all steps of the sweep and a set of them is shown in figure 1.

There is another class of histograms which is specific to a certain gap width and amplification configuration and, hence, is filled only during that specific sweep step. The numbers of those histograms are denoted as

10000 * amplification step + 100 * gap step + generic ID.

The fast signal charge, stored in the histogram with the generic D 15, is an example for this group of histograms.
