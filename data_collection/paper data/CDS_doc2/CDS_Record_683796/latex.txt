**1. Model description.**

Despite the remarkable success of the Standard Model in describing present precision electroweak data, the mechanism responsible for breaking electroweak symmetry remains unknown.

One of the main problems of the theory with fundamental scalars is "triviality"; i.e. it is not possible to construct an interacting theory of scalars in four dimensions which is valid to arbitrary short distance scales[1]. This problem is absent in supersymmetric models, but up to now there exists no experimental evidence for the existence of supersymmetric particles and it is interesting to examine other variants.

There exist several models of strongly coupled electroweak symmetry breaking such as the standard model with a heavy Higgs boson, technicolor, composite models, etc. However predictions of these models can vary greatly from one to another.

Several years ago was introduced a theoretical framework that is able to describe generically the strong interactions of electroweak gauge bosons[2]. It is based on Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT)[3]. The idea is to write an effective chiral lagrangian including operators up to dimension four [4]. The form of the terms is only constrained by symmetry considerations which are common to any strong electroweak symmetry breaking sector. The differences among underlying theories appear through the values of the parameters in the chiral lagrangian.

\[+\frac{1}{16\pi^{2}v^{4}}(-\frac{t}{6}(s+2t)log(-\frac{t}{\mu^{2}})-\frac{u}{6}(s +2u)log(-\frac{u}{\mu^{2}})-\frac{s^{2}}{2}log(-\frac{s}{\mu^{2}}) \tag{11}\]

The values of \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\) depend on the model, but we expect them to be in the range \(10^{-2}\) to \(10^{-3}\).

The usual chiral lagrangian approach does not respect unitarity. The violation could be very large at high energies. There are several ways to unitarize chiral amplitudes, but the results are quite different for different procedures. Over the last few years a technique has been developed, known as the Inverse Amplitude Method[6],[7] which, when applied to low energy \(\pi-\pi\) and \(\pi\)K scattering [8], is able to reproduce a \(\rho\) and \(K^{\star}\) resonances by using parameters of the model obtained by a fit to experimental data significantly below these resonances.

The amplitudes in ChPT are obtained as an expansion in external momenta

\[t_{I,\,J}\approx t_{I,\,J}^{0}+t_{I,\,J}^{1}+t_{I,\,J}^{2}+... \tag{12}\]

where \(t_{I,\,J}^{(0)}\) is \({\cal O}(p^{2}),t_{I,\,J}^{(1)}\) is \({\cal O}(p^{4}),\)etc.. The key point in the IAM is to notice that we can calculate the imaginary part of the inverse amplitude exactly on the elastic cut. Assuming that the amplitude and the inverse amplitude have the same analytical properties and using the dispersion relation for the inverse amplitude, the relation

\[t_{I,\,J}\approx\frac{t_{I,\,J}^{(0)\,2}}{t_{I,\,J}^{(0)}-t_{I,\,J}^{(1)}} \tag{13}\]

was found.

The most interesting feature of this approach is that it allows us to describe all reactions (3)-(8) by using only two parameters \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\). It is possible to reproduce the broad Higgs-like resonance in \((0,0)\) channel. The analysis [9] shows that in the channel (1,1) there are narrow resonances up to mass smaller than 2500 GeV. This channel only depends on the combination \(L_{2}\) -2 \(L_{1}\) and to each value of mass of the resonance there corresponds only one value of \(\Gamma\). By comparing of the amplitude in this channel with the Breit-Wigber formula we can obtain the relation

\[M_{V}^{2}=\frac{v^{\,2}}{4(L_{2}-2L_{1})-\frac{1}{18(4\pi)^{2}}} \tag{14}\]

\[\Gamma_{V}=\frac{M_{V}^{3}}{96\pi v^{\,2}} \tag{15}\]

Figure 1 shows the dependence of the mass of the resonance versus \(L_{2}-2L_{1}\).

## 2 Signal and backgrounds.

The signal and backgrounds were simulated by using ATLFAST with PYTHIA 5.7 as an event generator. PYTHIA 5.7 was modified to generate the processes (3)-(8) for any values of \(L_{1}\) and \(L_{2}\). The effective vector boson approximation was used for the generation. The validity of such an approximation was analyzed in[10].

To estimate the observability of the signal the process of \(W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\to W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\) with the decay Z\(\rightarrow\) ll,l=e,\(\mu\), and W\(\rightarrow\) jj was generated. As was pointed out previously the channel (1,1) depends only on the combination \(L_{2}\) -2 \(L_{1}\) so we can vary only one parameter. The computation was made for two values of \(L_{2}\): 0.006 and 0.01. The parameter \(L_{1}\) was set equal to 0. For \(L_{2}\)=0.006 the cross section multiplied by corresponding branching ratios is equal 1.5 fb and peaks at a mass of 1.5 TeV; for \(L_{2}\)=0.01 the corresponding cross sections and mass are 2.8 fb and 1.2 TeV.

The main features of the signal are

* Two high-\(p_{t}\) leptons in the barrel region with the invariant mass consistent with the mass of Z-boson.
* Two high-\(p_{t}\) jets in the barrel region with the invariant mass consistent with the mass of W-boson.
* The presence of energetic jets in forward region

There are two kinds backgrounds for this process - irreducible (continuum WZ pair production) and reducible QCD background. The irreducible background was found to be negligible (see below).

Figure 1: Dependence of the mass (TeV) of the resonance on the value of \(L_{2}-2L_{1}\).

The main QCD background is the process of Z + multijet production. Two final-state jets can fake a W decay if the invariant mass of the jet pair is close to \(M_{W}\). Because it has a very large cross section in the whole phase space, and since we are interested only on events that could imitate the signal process \(W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\to W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\) scattering at high invariant mass, this background was generated with cuts \(\sqrt{\hat{s}}>1050\) GeV and \(P_{t,hard}>100\) GeV. The Born-level cross section for this process have been conservatively increased by a K-factor 1.5 to account for higher-order corrections. The cross section of Z + jets production multiplied by branchings of the leptonic decay of Z boson in such conditions is equal 0.414 pb. A sample of events with the cut \(P_{t,hard}>50\) GeV was also generated to check for possible bias due to cuts at the generation level. No influence of this cuts on the final number of the events was found.

The process \(t\overline{t}->WWb\overline{b}\) with leptonic decays is potentially dangerous due to its huge cross section, but the invariant mass of two leptons from W decay is very big for leptons with large transverse momentum due to the large angle between them. Figure 2 show the invariant mass of two leptons from W decay for several values of \(P_{t,cut}\).

The procedure for extracting the signal is similar to the one used in the \(H->ZZ\) analysis[11] and essentially the same cuts will be used here.

It is well known that the vector bosons in the processes \(V_{L}V_{L}\to V_{L}V_{L}\) scattering are produced mostly in the central region and are characterized by large values of transverse momenta. This characteristic is used to suppress the background by selecting high \(p_{t}\) decay products. Figure 3 shows the \(P_{t}\) distribution of the leptons for the signal and Z+jets background (the background was generated here with minimal \(P_{t}\) for the Z of 30 GeV). The histograms of the two processes were normalised to a same number of events.

The events were required to have two isolated and identified leptons of same flavour (ee or \(\mu\mu\)) and opposite charge in the barrel region (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) with \(p_{t}>100\) GeV. The invariant mass of these two leptons was required to lie in the region \(|M_{ll}-M_{Z}|<\)6 GeV. The overall efficiency of these selection criteria was \(\simeq\) 40%.

The jets were reconstructed by a cone algorithm with R=0.2 Due to the large W boost the cones of the jets could overlap. In that case the energy in the overlap region was shared between the two jets according to their relative energies. The resolution in the mass of reconstructed W was equal to 10 GeV. The events were required to have two jets with \(P_{t}>\)50 GeV and \(|\eta|<2\) and the invariant mass of these two jets needed to be consistent with the mass of the W: \(|M_{jj}-M_{W}|<\)15 GeV.

Both Z and W bosons were required to have a transverse momentum bigger 200 GeV.

To improve the signal/background ratio, forward jet tagging was used. The jets in the forward region 2 \(<|\eta|<\) 5 were reconstructed by a cone algorithm with R=0.5. The event was selected if jets with \(P_{t}>30\) GeV and energy larger than 500 GeV were present in both hemispheres. The overall efficiency of the tagging procedure was 0.25 for the signal process and 0.01 for Z+jets background.

The number of signal and background events in a 2\(\sigma\) interval around the mass of resonance, for an integrated luminosity of \({\cal L}=10^{5}pb^{-1}\) and after applyingdifferent cuts, are presented in table 1. There are two kinds backgrounds for this process - irreducible (continuum WZ pair production) and reducible QCD background. The irreducible background of WZ production is negligible, as mentioned above. It gives, after all cuts about 0.05 events in the mass window of WZ system.

Table 1. Number of signal and background events.

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c||c|c|} \hline Number of events & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(M_{V}\) =1.2 TeV} & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{\(M_{V}\) =1.5 TeV} \\ \hline  & \(W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\) & Z + jets & \(W_{L}^{\pm}Z_{L}\) & Z + jets \\ \hline Central jets cut & 284 & 2187 & 145 & 1781 \\ \hline \(M_{jj}=M_{W}\pm 15\) GeV & 101 & 154 & 46 & 82 \\ \hline Leptonic cuts & 70 & 84 & 36 & 47 \\ \hline Forward jet tagging & 14 & 3 & 8 & 1.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The resulting mass spectra for WZ candidates after all cuts show clear peaks with widths 75 GeV for the 1.2 TeV resonance and 100 GeV for the 1.5 TeV resonance. This is seen in Fig. 4, for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}pb^{-1}\). The expected number of events for one year of high luminosity (\(\mathcal{L}=\) 10\({}^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\)) is 8 for \(M_{V}=1.5\) TeV and 14 for \(M_{V}=1.2\) TeV with the background from Z+jets 1.3 and 3. These numbers are obtained after selecting the window \(|\!|M_{WZ}-M_{V}|<2\sigma\). In conclusion, it is possible, after a few years of running at high luminosity, to detect this process.
