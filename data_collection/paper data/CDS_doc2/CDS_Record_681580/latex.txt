**Abstract**

This note provides details on the analysis developed to select invisible Higgs decays in the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}H^{0}}\) and \(\mathrm{W^{\pm}H^{0}}\) channels. The study was performed with Fortran-based ATLFAST and shows the feasibility of the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}H^{0}}\) channel at \(2.7\sigma\) level for \(10\) fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. It also demonstrates why the \(\mathrm{W^{\pm}H^{0}}\) channel is not usable due to the overwhelming W inclusive background.

## 1 Introduction

Extensions of the Standard Model such as Majoron models predict different signatures for Higgs decays [1, 2] such as invisible Higgs decays into a pair of neutralinos: \(\mathrm{H^{0}}\rightarrow\chi^{0}\chi^{0}\). At the LHC, Higgs bosons can be produced in many ways but this analysis concentrates on associated production, when the Higgs boson is created in association with a \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) or a \(\mathrm{W^{\pm}}\) boson in the Bjorken (Higgsstrahlung) process as shown in Figure 1.

Being the lightest SUSY particles, neutralinos are stable and leave the detector without decaying, remaining undetected. Hence, when the Higgs boson decays into two neutralinos, the Higgs decay products themselves are invisible. The event can still be detected through the presence of large missing momentum accompanying the decay products of the associated boson, either a \(\mathrm{W^{\pm}}\) decaying into a lepton and a neutrino, or a \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) decaying into a pair of electrons or muons. In both cases, the leptons can be used to trigger on the event. The topology of invisible Higgs decays in the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}H^{0}}\) channel is best illustrated using the Atlas w

## 2 The \(\mathrm{W^{\pm}H^{0}}\) channel

The signature of an invisible Higgs decay in the \(\mathrm{W^{\pm}H^{0}}\) channel would be the presence of a single lepton produced in association with large missing momentum. In ATLAS, it will be much easier to evaluate the missing transverse momentum. Hence, we look for a single lepton and large missing transverse momentum, \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{\,\mathrm{miss}}}\).

Several other processes can mimic such decays. Three are considered here:

1. WZ decays with \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\rightarrow\nu\nu\): this is an irreducible background since its signature is identical to that of the signal;
2. W inclusive decays;
3. \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background, with \(\mathrm{t}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\ell\nu\).

The production cross-sections, as evaluated by Pythia 6.2 in ATLFAST, are given in Table 1, assuming a branching fraction of 100% into neutralinos. For the signal, a Higgs mass of 120 GeV is used for the simulation. The number of events expected for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) i.e. one LHC year of data collected at low luminosity, is also provided.

Figure 2: An invisible Higgs boson decay in the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}H^{0}}\) channel as seen on the ATLAS watch. The invisible Higgs boson (second hand, wiggly line) recoils against two prompt leptons (the hour and minute hands). One such event is visible every minute such that one could see as many as 2.1 million events before the beginning of the the LHC operation, unless the battery runs out before then.

### Event selection for the \(\mathrm{W^{\pm}H^{0}}\) channel

Events are selected if they pass the following selection criteria:

* one prompt lepton satisfying the trigger, i.e. an electron with transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\mathrm{GeV}\) or a muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV
* large missing transverse momentum, i.e. \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{miss}}>100\) GeV
* a maximum of one jet reconstructed in the event
* an anti-b-tag is applied to reject 60% of accepted b-jets. This is used to reject \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background, assuming a b-tag efficiency of 60%.

According to the study presented in [1], the \(\mathrm{W^{\pm}H^{0}}\) background could be efficiently suppressed by first applying the large \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{miss}}\) cut, and then selecting events with a large transverse mass, \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\), with \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) defined as the reconstructed mass in the transverse plane, namely:

\[\mathrm{m_{T}}=\mathrm{E_{T}}-\mathrm{p_{T}},\]

where \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) are the transverse energy and momentum, respectively. Unfortunately, this proved to be insufficient, given that the large \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{miss}}\) cut selects events in the tail of the \(m_{W}\) mass distribution as can be seen in Figure 3. These events tend to also have large transverse mass. Given that the production cross-section of W inclusive events is five orders of magnitude larger than that for the signal, it leads to an overwhelming background as can be seen from Table 1. The signal significance, \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{B}}\), is 0.7. Hence, this channel is deemed unfeasible and will not be pursued. This situation was indeed predicted in another theoretical analysis [2] where it is shown that the tail of the \(\mathrm{m_{W}}\) distribution is selected when applying a high \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{miss}}\) cut.

## 3 The \(\mathrm{Z^{0}H^{0}}\) channel

The signal of an invisibly decaying Higgs boson in the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}H^{0}}\) channel can be detected when the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) decays into two leptons. The Higgs presence is detected from the missing transverse

momentum. The combined LEP Higgs boson mass limit in this channel is 114.4 GeV [3]. Four different backgrounds with signatures similar to the signal have been studied:

1. the \(\mathrm{Z}^{0}\,\mathrm{Z}^{0}\) background, with one \(\mathrm{Z}^{0}\) going to \(\nu\nu\), the other to \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) giving a signature similar to the signal (irreducible background)
2. the \(\mathrm{Z}^{0}\) inclusive, with \(\mathrm{Z}^{0}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\)
3. \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) with each \(t\to b\ell\nu\)
4. \(\mathrm{Z}^{0}\mathrm{Z}^{0}\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) backgrounds.

The production cross-sections for the signal with \(m_{\mathrm{h}}=120\) GeV and these backgrounds are given in Table 2. The production cross-sections for various signal mass hypotheses are given in Table 3. Events are selected if they pass the following selection criteria:

* one prompt lepton satisfying either the single lepton trigger, i.e. an electron with transverse momentum, \(p_{T}>25\) GeV or a muon with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV, or the di-lepton trigger, each lepton with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV for electrons or 10 GeV for muons.

Figure 3: (top row) Using parton level information, the reconstructed \(W\) mass and (bottom row) transverse mass for \(W\) inclusive events. In the left column, a low statistic (250k events) sample was used and no \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) cut had been applied at generation. For the high-statistics sample (56M events) of the right column, a \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}>50\,\mathrm{GeV}/c\) cut was applied at generation. One can see by comparing the top two plots how the \(\mathrm{p}_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) cut selects events in the tail of the \(\mathrm{m}_{W}\) distribution. These events have a large transverse mass, as shown in the bottom right plot, which only becomes clearly visible when one generates very large samples.

* large missing transverse momentum, i.e. \(\rm p_{T}^{miss}>93.7\) GeV. This cut effectively suppresses the \(\rm Z^{0}\) inclusive background;
* the event must contain at least two leptons of same flavor but opposite charge;
* a maximum of one jet reconstructed in the event. This is applied to remove contributions from the \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background;
* an anti-b-tag is applied to reject 60% of accepted jets. This is used to reject the remaining \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background.

The high \(\rm p_{T}^{miss}\) cut selects events with genuine missing momentum as for the signal or events where some particles have been lost in some inefficient regions of the detectors. Such is the case for the \(\rm Z^{0}\) inclusive and \(\rm Z^{0}\)\(\rm Z^{0}\)\(\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) samples. For the latter, the \(\rm p_{T}^{miss}\) cut applied alone tends to select events where at least one muon has escaped for having a pseudorapidity \(\eta\) greater than 2.5, which is the detection limit of the muon system. At that stage, the sample contains 99% muons. Applying the two lepton requirement rejects the vast majority of the remaining sample, leaving only 0.03% of the original sample.

The effect of the \(\rm p_{T}^{miss}\) selection cut is illustrated in Figure 4 for the \(\rm Z^{0}\)H\({}^{0}\) signal and the main backgrounds. Past about 100 GeV, most of the \(\rm Z^{0}\) inclusive background is suppressed. The \(\rm p_{T}^{miss}\) distribution is also given for the signal assuming different Higgs masses in the 120-180 GeV range. The loss in production cross-section for a high Higgs mass is partially compensated by a harder \(\rm p_{T}^{miss}\) spectrum.

### Likelihood selection

In order to improve the discovery potential of this channel, the most discriminative variables are used to form a likelihood variable. These variables are shown in Figure 5 for the data and the background after applying the preselection cuts listed above. These variables are combined using the Projection and Correlation method [4]. This method has the advantage of taking into account the correlations between the input variables. The optimization of the selection cuts and the choice of input variables was based on maximizing the purity times the efficiency. The variables retained for their discriminating power are shown in Figure 5 and are described here:

* \(p_{T}\) of the promptest lepton (ptlep 1)
* \(p_{T}\) of the second lepton (ptlep 2)
* the cosine of the angle between the two leptons (cos l)
* the same angle measured in the transverse plane (cos l (xy plane))
* the \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{miss}}\)distribution (ptmiss)
* the transverse mass \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) (mt)
* the cosine of the angle between the promptest lepton and the direction of the missing momentum in the transverse plane (cos ptmiss-l)

(right) The \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{miss}}\) distribution for the signal generated for different Higgs masses. All events have been reweighted to correspond to an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\).

* the invariant mass of the di-lepton system, which should reproduce the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\,\mathrm{mass}\,\mathrm{distribution}\). This variable is particularly efficient at rejecting the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background

## 4 Systematic uncertainties and background calibration

At this point, it is hard to fully assess the size of systematic uncertainties. At best, one can look at various sources and guess their possible contribution. This is precisely what has been done here. Following the work done for Higgs boson couplings measurements [5], estimates of contributions to the systematic uncertainties are given in Table 5.

Without any calibration, the largest contribution to the systematic uncertainty would be in estimating the background production cross-section, most importantly the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) production cross-section. To reduce this uncertainty, one can use the clean, background-free \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\mathrm{Z^{0}}\rightarrow\ell\ell\ell\ell\) channel to calibrate the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) production cross-section since the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) branching ratios to leptons and neutrinos are very well known. Hence, the uncertainty on the largest Standard Model background, namely the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\mathrm{Z^{0}}\rightarrow\ell\ell\nu\nu\) channel, can be greatly reduced.

To do so, a separate algorithm was used to select \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\mathrm{Z^{0}}\rightarrow\ell\ell\ell\ell\) events for background calibration purpose. In order to retain a statistically significant sample, the \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{miss}}\) cut is not applied and two pairs of leptons with invariant mass within 15 GeV of \(\mathrm{m_{Z}}\) are sought. The selection criteria of Section 3 are slightly modified as follows:

Figure 5: The input variables used to form a likelihood function: _ptlep1_ and _ptlep2_: transverse momentum \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{\ell}}\) of the most and least energetic leptons; _cosll_: cosine of the angle between the two lepton momentum vectors in 3-D and in the transverse plane; _ptmiss_: missing momentum in the transverse plane; _mt_: transverse mass, \(cos\)_ptmiss_\(\boldsymbol{-}\)_: cosine of the angle between \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{miss}}\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{\ell}}\); _mll_: invariant mass of the two leptons.

* one prompt lepton satisfying either the single lepton trigger, i.e. an electron with transverse momentum, \(p_{T}>25\) GeV or a muon with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV, or the di-lepton trigger, each lepton with \(p_{T}>15\) GeV for electrons or 10 GeV for muons;
* the event must contain at least two pairs of leptons of same flavor but opposite charge;
* a maximum of one jet reconstructed in the event.
* an anti-b-tag is applied to reject 60% of accepted jets.

The two \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) pairs are ordered in terms of closeness to the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) mass and their distributions are shown in Figure 7. The above selection criteria lead to an efficiency of 17.6 %. From Table 2, one gets 9.5% uncertainty on \(\sigma_{ZZ}\) with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, reducing to 3% for 100 fb\({}^{-1}\).

One could also use this sample to check the adequacy of the \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{miss}}\) simulation by applying a cut of \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{\,miss}}>97\,\mathrm{GeV}/c\) and comparing data and Monte Carlo. Combining all sources listed in Table 5, one obtains \(\pm 7.6\%\) variation on the signal yield and \(\pm 13.9\%\) variation for the background. This gives about \(\pm 10\%\) variation on the \(S/\sqrt{B}\) estimates. These estimates will also need to be scaled down if the \(\mathrm{BR}(\mathrm{H^{0}}\to\chi^{0}\chi^{0})\) is less than 100%.

## 5 Conclusion

If the Higgs boson decays to neutralinos, the ATLAS experiment should be able to detect such decays in the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}H^{0}}\) channel for a Higgs mass within \(\{110-180\}\) GeV with less than 200 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, that is, within two years of data taking at high luminosity. If the Higgs boson mass is below 160 GeV or so, this could be done within one year of high luminosity operation. All these estimates assume 100% BR(H\({}^{0}\rightarrow\chi^{0}\chi^{0}\)). Hopefully, more invisible Higgs boson decays will be seen with the Atlas detector than on the Atlas watch of Figure 2!
