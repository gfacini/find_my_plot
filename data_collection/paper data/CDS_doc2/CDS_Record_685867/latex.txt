**Radiation Damage Projections: Current status**

**Alex Chilingarov & Shaun Roe**

**1. Introduction**

This note is an attempt to explain the current status of radiation damage studies applied specifically to the ATLAS detector. We survey the data available and discuss the models and assumptions which are made to extract data on the principal effects of radiation damage in a silicon detector, which are:

\(\bullet\)Leakage current increase

\(\bullet\)Depletion voltage increase

\(\bullet\)Signal deficit

\(\bullet\)Derived quantities, such as the increase in noise and power dissipation

To illustrate the implications of our present understanding of the data, we have produced figures which show the theoretical ten-year operation of a silicon tracker. While it is tempting to seize upon the figures as a prediction, they are more useful as an indication of which are the main problems arising from radiation damage and which factors deserve further study. Any presentation of the figures without discussion of the many assumptions which have gone into producing them would be a fruitless one, and we therefore describe their background in some detail.

**2. Models used for radiation damage**

Initial measurements of radiation damage to silicon detectors concentrated on the leakage current increase [1,2], and then upon the annealing of this damage with time. These measurements used a variety of irradiation sources and in order to standardise the damage coefficients obtained the 'NIEL' hypothesis was used [3], whereby the bulk damage produced is assumed to be proportional to the non-ionising energy loss of the particular radiation used. Damage constants quoted in recent works are often standardised to the damage would be caused by 1MeV neutron equivalent dose, and this paper uses that convention. More recently radiation-induced change in doping concentration has become the focus of attention [4] and it has been found that the 'anti-annealing' which occurs in this case can, in the long term, increase the initial effect which is measured after irradiation. The data on this effect are scarce [5(ii-iv)], and in particular there is very little data on the effect at temperatures lower than 20\({}^{\circ}\)C. It should be stressed that there is currently no underlying physical model (in terms of basic defect production) which can be used to predict radiation damage effects.

### The 'NIEL' hypothesis

Curves for non-ionising energy loss are shown in figure 1 for different kinds of particles [6].

It has been confirmed experimentally that radiation damage in low resistivity silicon scales very well according to the curves shown for neutron and protons over a wide range of energies [7, 8], although some material dependence has also been reported [9, 10]. In the case of electrons, the bulk damage is found to be overestimated by this scaling [11], and this is generally attributed to the different nature of the defects (i.e. point like, as opposed to complex clusters of bulk defects) produced by electrons.

The NIEL hypothesis has not been proven for high resistivity silicon and there are very little data available for pion irradiation in particular. Pions are especially important, as the main source of radiation damage at LHC is expected to come from pions close to the interaction region [12]. The RD20 and RD2 groups are currently trying to redress this situation by gaining access to the pion irradiation facility at PSI, Villigen, and the forthcoming neutrino experiments which may also produce a suitable pion fluence at CERN.

Figure 1: Non-ionising energy loss (from ref. [6])The situation regarding the dopant density increase, observed in the laboratory as an increase in the depletion voltage, is far from being clear. A range of figures has been measured (see section 3.3) for the damage constant which does not appear to obey the NIEL scaling between data for neutrons and protons.

**2.2 Leakage current increase and annealing**

Leakage current increase is assumed to be proportional to the received flux, according to

(1) \(\Delta\)I(\(\phi\)) = \(\alpha\) \(\phi\)

After irradiation has ended, the initial leakage current increase, \(\Delta\)I(0), is seen to anneal with time. This annealing has been fitted [13] to an expression of the form

(2) \(\Delta\)I(t) = \(\Delta\)I(0)\(\sum_{\text{i=1}}^{\text{n}}a_{\text{i}}\) exp(-t/\(\tau_{\text{i}}\))

with n=5 or 6 terms. There exists a number of values for the time constants (tau) and fractional components (a) which can model the data. It can be shown that the most important contributions are those with time constants longer than the irradiation time, and long term projections are sensitive to these time constants only. In order to calculate the total leakage current increase during irradiation taking annealing into account, an integral equation may be used

(3) \(\Delta\)I(\(\phi\),t) = \(\int_{\text{t'=0}}^{\text{t}}\alpha\)\(\frac{\text{d}\phi}{\text{dt'}}\)\(\int_{\text{i=1}}^{\text{n}}a_{\text{i}}\) exp(-(t-t')/\(\tau_{\text{i}}\)) dt'

In comparing 0\({}^{\circ}\)C and 20\({}^{\circ}\)C, we assume a constant ratio of the current at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C to that at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C for all annealing times, as in [14].

**2.3 Effective dopant increase and 'anti annealing'**

As n or p type silicon are irradiated, they tend to become more p type. At some point, around \(\phi\) = \(10^{13}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\), n type silicon inverts and becomes p type [15]. The effective carrier concentration, Neff, is usually measured by measuring the capacitance of a diode and determining the voltage at which full depletion occurs.

This is related to Neff by

(4a) \(\text{V}_{\text{d}}\) = \(\frac{q\,\left|\text{1Neff}\right|\,\text{t'}^{2}}{2\,\text{e}_{\text{s}}}\)

or

(4b) \(\text{V}_{\text{d}}\)= 68.45 \(\frac{\left|\text{1Neff}\right|\,\left(\text{cm}^{-3}\right)}{10^{12}}\) (\(\frac{\text{t'}\left(\text{\mu m}\right)}{300}\))where

\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{s}}\) = dielectric constant of silicon, 11.9 \(\times\) 8.85x10-12 F/m

V\({}_{\mathrm{d}}\) = depletion voltage

q = electron charge, 1.602 x 10-19 C

t = detector thickness

Most detectors are operated with a bias some tens of volts above the depletion voltage to ensure fast charge collection, although it has been shown that if the depletion voltage is high, very little overdepletion is required [16].

The fluence dependence of N\({}_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is complicated by the fact that the silicon contains an initial concentration of both donor and acceptor type dopants. We therefore adopt the notation that N\({}_{\mathrm{eff}}\) is positive for n-type silicon, and the following model:

(5) N\({}_{\mathrm{eff}}\)(\(\phi\),t) = Nd\({}_{\mathrm{0}}\) exp(-c\(\phi\))-Na\({}_{\mathrm{0}}\)-Na\({}_{\mathrm{s}}\)-R(\(\phi\),t)

(6) R(\(\phi\),t) = N\({}_{\mathrm{ni}}\) (1 - \(\frac{1}{1+\)kN\({}_{\mathrm{ni}}\)t})

where the symbols are defined as follows:

R(\(\phi\),t) 'Anti-annealing' function, dependent upon time and fluence. The particular solution of R(\(\phi\), t) given by eqn.(6) for the temporal equations (9) is only valid if the irradiation time is small in comparison with the annealing time.

Nd\({}_{\mathrm{0}}\): Initial donor concentration

Na\({}_{\mathrm{0}}\): Initial acceptor concentration

Na\({}_{\mathrm{s}}\): Concentration of stable acceptor type defects introduced by irradiation at a

rate B\({}_{\mathrm{s}}\) = Na\({}_{\mathrm{s}}\)/\(\phi\). Implicit in this is the fact that we disregard short term

annealing.

N\({}_{\mathrm{ni}}\): Concentration of each of the two inert reagents which subsequently react to

produce an acceptor-like defect; each are introduced at a rate B\({}_{\mathrm{n}}\) = N\({}_{\mathrm{ni}}\)/\(\phi\).

C: Donor removal constant

k: Reaction constant for the two inert reagents introduced by irradiation

\(\phi\): Particle fluence normalised by NIEL to 1MeV neutron equivalent

There are some fairly broad assumptions made in this model, in both the fluence dependence and the time dependence. The removed donors do not anneal and initial acceptors are not removed in this model. The time dependence model (Eqn. 9) has been proposed [5 ii] to explain the fluence dependence of the 'anti-annealing' rate and assumes that two initially neutral reagents, introduced by irradiation, subsequently react together to produce an electrically active acceptor defect. Short term annealing (which decreases Neff initially and has a decay time of about a week even at 0oC) is neglected due to the much longer irradiation period typical in the LHC environment. The time constant associated with reverse annealing is about one year at 20oC and is far more pronounced at fluences greater than 1013 neutrons/cm2.

The fluence dependence can in fact also be modelled at least equally well by assuming that only one acceptor type mid-gap defect is introduced by irradiation, and the donors are not removed, but this apparently simpler model requires full simulation of the silicon bulk properties (such as the Fermi level), and a satisfactory annealing behaviour remains to be calculated [17]. There is at present no conclusive evidence to support either theory; the DLTS method which is often used to identify defects is difficult to apply to high resistivity silicon, and impossible to apply when irradiation exceeds 1012 neutrons/cm2.

### 2.4 Signal deficit

There is little data on signal deficit at fluences higher than 1013 neutrons/cm2[16, 18, 20], and even less on the effect at lower temperatures; the effect appears to be linear with fluence and is basically associated with reduced speed of charge collection [19] due to trapping. Greater voltage can be applied or a longer shaping time can be used to compensate for the effect. It is unclear what happens at lower temperatures; electron mobility increases, but the time constants associated with trapping may also increase.

### 2.5 Noise and power dissipation

The detector noise depends upon the capacitance of a given channel, the leakage current and the bias resistance. The total capacitance of a 50m pitch strip may change by 30% with irradiation [21], and will not be dealt with here, whereas the leakage current varies by orders of magnitude. The relation between noise and leakage current is given approximately by

(7) ENC = (2 q I )1/2

Where I = leakage current, q = electron charge, T = amplifier shaping time.

This is illustrated for a charge amplifier of 25ns shaping time in Fig. 2. The current noise adds in quadrature to other contributions. The bias resistance contributes in a similar way, the noise being given by

\[\text{ENC}=\left(\frac{4\ k\ T\ T}{R}\right)^{1/2} \tag{8}\]

where k = Boltzmann constant, T = absolute temperature, R = bias resistance. Polysilicon bias resistors are extremely radiation tolerant [22], but even FOXFET biased devices maintain a tolerable bias resistance after approx. 10\({}^{14}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\) dose [23].

To calculate the power dissipated we have simply multiplied the leakage current by the depletion voltage. This gives a certain underestimate because the detector will be operated overdepleted in any case.

Figure 2: Illustration of Equations (7) and (8) for 25ns shaping time.

### 3.2 Radiation levels

Initial calculations of the radiation levels in the ATLAS detector were performed by A. Ferrari et al. [25], using the FLUKA program and later by Thierry Mouthuy [12] for the LoI detector configuration using GEANT with GHEISHA hadronic

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Layer & Radius (cm) & length & type & Channel size \\  & & (cm) & & \\ \hline
1 & 11.5 & 72 & pixel & 50\(\mu\)m x 200\(\mu\)m \\ \hline
2 & 14.5 & 84 & pixel & 50\(\mu\)m x 200\(\mu\)m \\ \hline

\end{table}
Table 1: ATLAS detector parametersmodel and PYTHIA physics generator, including magnetic field and neutron moderator and using a luminosity of 10\({}^{34}\) cm-2 s-1. The radiation is composed of two basic components: the neutron albedo, fairly homogenous throughout the detector, and the charged particle flux which decreases as 1/r\({}^{2}\) from the interaction point. The charged particle damage (scaled according to NIEL) is dominated by pions. Ref.[12] states an uncertainty of 30% on the final scaled damage.

More recently, the FLUKA code has been used (with DTUJET) to calculate the radiation in the 'Coseners House' design with a more realistic luminosity scenario [26]. The figures are lower than the GEANT calculations corrected to 1.7 x 10\({}^{34}\) cm-2 s-1, and in the following calculations, the FLUKA estimation has been used, since the program is specifically written to estimate radiation levels. Although the FLUKA code can give a relative accuracy of 10% when comparing designs, the absolute accuracy is not thought to be better than a factor of two [25].

Both calculation results are presented in figure 3.

Table 2 gives total equivalent doses for the different layers. The stated doses are averages over the entire length of the detector, but there will be some longitudinal dependence which means that the ends of the detector layers will receive significantly more radiation than the central section. No z dependence is given by ref. [26], but an indication of this effect may be gained from the figures in ref. [12]. Table 3 gives the ratio of fluence at the end of a detector to the mid-section fluence

for the inner layers.

### Radiation damage constants

Alex Chilingarov has surveyed recent literature and interpreted the results in terms of the models above to extract the parameters. The leakage current damage constant is consistently believed to be about 7.5 x 10-17 A/cm (\(\pm\)20%) at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C, although it is difficult to compare results because each experimenter measures the damage constant at different times and may or may not correct for annealing. The value of the damage constant measured after about six months is approximately

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Layer & Radius (cm) & Neutron equivalent fluence & Charged particle equivalent fluence & Total equivalent fluence \\ \hline

Table 3: Ratio of fluences along a detector layer \(3.0\times 10^{-17}\) A/cm. The most recent annealing time constants have been used, taken from [28], and the leakage current damage constant was increased to 10.0 x 10-17 A/cm to agree with the above mentioned long term damage constant, allowing for annealing.

The damage constants for \(\mathrm{N_{eff}}\) in equation (5) are presented in figures 4-6 for neutrons and protons separately [30]. The following paper notation is used in the plots.

published by the same group in the same paper for the same conditions, only the highest and the lowest values are shown (for compactness they are put into the same source bin when they deviate in different directions from the average value). All values presented in the plots come into the averaging with equal weight. If the publication presents the data obtained at different temperatures it is marked on the plot1. "Warm" denotes room temperature, "cool" means the temperature between 0 and 10 \({}^{\circ}\)C. All other data are measured at room temperature, except "Hamburg-93/2" data in fig.6 which are partially obtained at elevated temperatures (up to 70 \({}^{\circ}\)C) to speed up the reverse annealing process. For "Los Alamos" data [5 iii, xi, xii] we have applied the following NIEL correcting coefficients:

When \(\mathrm{B_{s}}\) was not obtained explicitly by the authors of the publication it was extracted from the corresponding production rate of all electrically active defects \(\mathrm{B_{total}}\) or from \(\mathrm{N_{eff}}\) /\(\phi\) and the annealing curve. Either the lowest or the "plateau" value in the time dependence, reached typically after about a week annealing time, was taken as \(\mathrm{B_{s}}\) value. Since in all cases the fluences were about \(10^{14}\) cm-2 the admixture of \(\mathrm{N_{A0}}\) in \(\mathrm{N_{eff}}\) was neglected when \(\mathrm{N_{eff}}\) /\(\phi\) was used.

Table 5 summarises the extracted parameters and intervals of uncertainty (the minimum and maximum values observed).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline  & neutrons & protons \\ \hline c (x 10\({}^{-13}\) cm\({}^{2}\)) & 2.2 (+1.3 -0.7) & 0.9 (+0.6 -0.5) \\ \hline \(\mathrm{B_{s}}\) (x 10\({}^{-2}\) cm-1) & 2.3 (+2.2 -1.8) & 1.3 (+0.7 -0.5) \\ \hline \(\mathrm{B_{n}}\) (x 10\({}^{-2}\) cm-1) & 4.3 (+1.4 -1.7) & 2.8 (+1.5 -1.0) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: \(\mathrm{N_{eff}}\) damage constants and uncertainty intervalsIt should be made clear that the constants have both been NIEL corrected, and should therefore be the same; this is obviously not the case, and leaves us with the problem of which NIEL corrected constant should be used for pions. We assume in the following that the pions are at least not more damaging than the protons, and use the proton damage constant for the pions. The neutron damage constant is used only for the neutron flux.

Initial concentrations of acceptors and donors are not usually known separately, but only as their difference, \(\mathrm{N_{eff}}\), which is proportional to the depletion voltage (see eqn. 4). From the data one can conclude that for standard detector grade material, \(\mathrm{Na_{0}}\sim 2\times 10^{11}\) cm\({}^{-3}\). We assumed the following values in our calculations:

\(\mathrm{Na_{0}}=3\times 10^{11}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)

\(\mathrm{Nd_{0}}=6\times 10^{11}\) cm\({}^{-3}\)

The signal deficit, taken to be linear with fluence up to \(10^{14}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\) equivalent, is assumed to occur at approximately 1.5% per \(10^{13}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\).

**4. Long term projections**

**4.1 Luminosity**

The luminosity is assumed to be \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) for the first three years, growing to \(1.7\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) for the last seven years. Note that the calculated fluences are only from physics running; no account is taken of the dose received during beam fill for instance, which could be an additional source of damage.

**4.2 Temperature**

The projections have been performed for three temperature scenarios; constant \(0^{\circ}\)C, constant \(20^{\circ}\)C and a varied temperature scheme in which the detector is kept mostly at \(0^{\circ}\)C but allowed to warm up to \(20^{\circ}\)C for one month in the middle of each beam-off period. This last scenario may be the most realistic, allowing one month maintenance access each year during which it is assumed that there is no cooling.

**4.3 Method**

The leakage current has been calculated from the integral equation given above for each of the time steps (240 in all). The depletion voltage calculation is performed at the carrier density level and done iteratively. Assuming that the neutral reagents x and y are introduced at a rate \(\mathrm{B_{n}}\) as defined above, and produce electrically active centres z, the differential equations can be written down:

\(\mathrm{(9a)}\)\(\mathrm{\frac{d[x]}{dt}=B_{n}\frac{d\phi}{dt}-\frac{d[z]}{dt}}\)(9b) \(\frac{\mathrm{d}[y]}{\mathrm{d}t}=B_{n}\frac{\mathrm{d}\phi}{\mathrm{d}t}\cdot \frac{\mathrm{d}[z]}{\mathrm{d}t}\) and (9c) \(\frac{\mathrm{d}[z]}{\mathrm{d}t}=\mathrm{k}\left[\mathrm{d}\right]\left[y\right]\) or (10) \(\Delta[z]=\mathrm{k}\left(B_{n}\phi-[z]\right)^{2}\Delta t\) (k is the reaction rate coefficient)

### Assumptions

At temperatures below 20\({}^{\circ}\)C, we assume the annealing of the leakage current proceeds at the same rate, only the current scales according to.

(11) \(\mathrm{I}=I_{0}\exp\{\mathrm{-E}_{g}/2\mathrm{kT}\}\)

With \(\mathrm{E}_{g}\)=1.12eV (i.e. the silicon band gap), giving a ratio of 5:1 for \(\mathrm{I}(20^{\circ}\mathrm{C})\):\(\mathrm{I}(0^{\circ}\mathrm{C})\), in reasonable agreement with [14]. The leakage current also increases due to another effect, namely that the bias voltage must be increased in order to deplete the detector fully, which can give a larger surface contribution to the leakage current. This effect is ignored in the following treatment, which means that the leakage current and power dissipation figures are probably somewhat optimistic.

The 'anti-annealing' shows strong temperature dependence; and we use the only model available which attempts to quantify this by scaling k with the Boltzmann factor [29]:

(12) \(\mathrm{k}=\mathrm{f}\exp\{\mathrm{-E}/\mathrm{kT}\}\)

with \(\mathrm{f}=2400\) cm\({}^{3}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and \(\mathrm{E}=1.35\mathrm{eV}\).

### Data presentation

A presentation of error analysis for all the variables used in the model is necessarily complicated. We start by showing representative curves of leakage current, depletion voltage and power dissipation for the innermost and outermost layers for the three temperature schemes In the successive plots, the values of leakage current, depletion voltage and power dissipation are taken at the end of the ten year period for each layer and plotted as a function of values for the variable being examined in order to indicate how a given uncertainty in the variable translates into the observed phenomena. These plots are included in the text when referred to explicitly; the others may be found in the appendix. The final operating values are then shown as a function of radius, extracted from the previous graphs. The summary graphs and error analysis calculations have all been performed for the mixed temperature scenario outlined in section 4.2.

### Leakage current and noise

Consideration of the leakage current shows that the increase should not be a problem for any of the detectors, even at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C. The leakage current stays below 10\(\mu\)A per channel in all cases, which corresponds to about 1700 electrons noise contribution. An investigation of the leakage current dependence on luminosity for the mixed temperature scheme shows that the luminosity (or equivalently, the damage constants) could double before presenting a noise problem.

Fig.7: Leakage current projections for layers 1 and 9 (in this simple model, the one month warming simply raises the current to the 20\({}^{\circ}\)C level for that month). The first three years are at low luminosity.

### Depletion voltage

Taking the nominal values for all the damage constants, the present calculation shows that there could be a serious problem of depletion voltage with the current design. The representative graphs for layers 1 and 9 (figure 9) show that the inner layer should have a depletion voltage of over 150V++ after ten years even at a constant 0\({}^{\circ}\)C. The summary graph of V\({}_{\mbox{\small dep}}\) (calculated for 300\(\upmu\)m detectors only) vs radius with year as a parameter (figure 10) shows that the layers 300\(\upmu\)m thick need to be beyond 40cm to remain at a depletion voltage below 150V for the full ten years (curve 10).

Footnote †: \({}^{\dagger}\) 150V is a benchmark figure chosen arbitrarily by the authors for illustration; the graphs enable the reader to substitute his/her own value and draw the appropriate conclusions.

The detector thicknesses have been set to 300\(\upmu\)m to ease comparison. (Divide by 4 to arrive at the actual depletion voltage for layers 1 and 2 at 11.5 cm and 14.5 cm)

Figure 10: Depletion voltage vs radius at the end of each operating year (years labelled 1 to 10; the first three years are at low luminosity)

Figure 9: Depletion voltage projection for layers 1 and 9. The first three years are at low luminosity.

The luminosity (or fluence) uncertainty may be as much as a factor of two; figure 11 shows the effect this would have on the depletion voltage for each of the layers after ten years of operation. If the luminosity is doubled, only layers at or beyond 70cm appear to remain below 150V depletion voltage.

Given that the depletion voltage may be the single most important factor in determining the silicon lifetime, we have tried to estimate the error on the voltage after ten years running taking into account all the uncertainties, and this graph is reproduced in Fig. 12.

Figure 12 has been produced by calculating separate ten year projections with:

(a) Luminosity reduced by factor of two.

(b) All damage parameters set to their minimum values in the uncertainty interval.

(c) Reduced temperature throughout (The error in k, the reaction constant in eqn. 12, has been taken from [29], from which it is estimated that the

Figure 11: The effect of luminosity (or fluence) upon the final depletion voltage for layers 1 to 9. (labelled V1 to V9; layers 1 and 2 are 150\(\upmu\)m thick)

uncertainty is approximately equivalent to a 6\({}^{\circ}\)C temperature error. This effect is small but nevertheless we have included it).

The deviations of (a), (b) and (c) from the 'best guess' values have then been added in quadrature at each radius, and the square root of this subtracted from the 'best guess' values to give the lower error limit. The upper error limit has been derived in a similar way: increasing the luminosity by a factor of two, setting all damage constants to their maximal values, increasing the temperature.

This is an extremely simplistic approach, but nevertheless gives an approximate idea of the limits on the projections.

### Power dissipation

If the readout electronics is assumed to have a power dissipation of 2mW per channel, it can be seen (Fig.13) that the detector itself may contribute significantly and this is much worse if it is kept constantly at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C. For the mixed temperature scenario, layer 3 is the worst and contributes about 500\(\upmu\)W after ten years. In layers 3 and 4, where only half the strips are connected to amplifiers, suitable cooling

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:21]

### Signal deficit

Naively applying the linear relationship for signal deficit to each of the layers at high luminosity would give the following figures for the various layers:

Layers 1 and 2 probably show other effects which will modify the calculated figures. We should mention, however, that one group finds a signal deficit approximately a factor of five lower [27], and it remains to be seen whether the effect is in fact technology dependent, so that a lower signal deficit can be engineered in the detector design.

## 5 Conclusions and discussion

In many senses, these calculations should be seen as the 'best case' scenario, since there are many effects which are simply not considered, but already one can see that the principle dangers for the inner detector may be the increase in depletion voltage and the signal deficit; the power dissipation is not a problem provided

Table 6: Theoretical signal deficitcooling power is enough to accommodate the detector heat dissipation. The effect of depletion voltage may be compensated by using thinner detectors to some extent. Making the detector half as thin is equivalent to doubling its radial distance in terms of depletion voltage increase (where the charged particle damage is dominant), but signal is also lost. Given the minimum signal/noise which can be tolerated, the detector thickness may yet be optimised.

Presently accepted limits on the operating voltage of detectors are in any case based upon experience with detectors which were never designed with high voltage operation in mind, and some improvements may yet be made. It is plain, however, that the detectors should be kept cool whenever possible to minimise the anti-annealing effect.

The signal deficit is as yet not very well characterised, and may be solved by suitable processing technology. If it is really as large an effect as indicated, then no easy solution is apparent in the high fluence areas.

Power dissipation may be a danger in the inner layers, and the cooling system should be designed with this in mind. If the detector is allowed to warm up while operating, there is a very real danger of thermal runaway.

Probably the largest source of uncertainty in these calculations lies in the fluence estimations. The fluence figures themselves are not more certain than a factor of two, and are only valid for damage sustained during physics running - no account is taken of damage sustained during beam fill or machine development. The damage constant for pions also remains an unknown factor in the damage estimations.

**Appendix: Variation of parameters over the uncertainty intervals**

This section presents graphs which give an idea of the uncertainty in the projected values after ten years given the uncertainty intervals in the various constants. All results are presented for the mixed temperature scenario and a luminosity which is \(10^{33}\) in the first three years, rising to \(1.7\times 10^{34}\) in the last seven years. The dependence of \(\mathrm{V_{dep}}\) upon the temperature (kept constant) is also shown.

It becomes clear that the critical parameters close to the beam are the neutral and stable production constants for protons, whereas farther away the neutron stable production constant is more important. This is to be expected considering that the charged particle flux is dominant at small radii. In no case, however, is the difference over the uncertainty interval sufficiently large to substantially change the results. Only the luminosity error factor (presented in the main text) is significant enough to do this.
