parameters were changed:

- Coil field calculation tolerance was diminish from 10 Gauss to 0.1 Gauss....(1)

- Tosca convergence parameter was changed from 10\({}^{-3}\) to 5\(\times\)10\({}^{-4}\)....(2)

- Number of nodes was increased \(\approx\) 3 times and mostly at the Extended Barrel edge region....(3)

- For field calculation it was used more accurate so called "nodal" instead of "shape function" method....(4)

The results were as following:

- The maximum field changes were mostly due to the (4)-modification and particularly at the Extended Barrel edge.

- The central region (Z \(\equiv\) 0) was almost insensitive to this modification.

- Number of nodes, the modification-(3), mattered also only at the Extended Barrel edge.

- The total change of the field value at the edge was about order of magnitude due to these modifications of the calculation conditions.

## 3 Barrel Toroid Switched on

### Central (Z \(\equiv\) 0) TileCal Barrel plane

This set of calculations was done with the only Barrel toroid coils with the nonzero current. The rest of the ATLAS coil system (Fig.1) was without current at all.

On the outer surface of iron exposed to the toroid stray field the maximum field value is \(\approx\) 8 kGauss. The maximum field occurs at the azimuth of the toroid coil and in between of the two toroid coils. This can be easily explained when looking at the flux lines distribution shown in Fig.17 of the ref.[3].

Field at the PMTs location is not more than 4 Gauss for the Z\(\equiv\)0-plane (Fig.4). In this Fig. three curves correspond to the low (394 cm), middle (400 cm) and upper (408 cm) radii within the radial range of the PMT location windows. The maximum PMT location field is at the middle azimuthal position of the iron taken for calculation which could be explained by the normal induction component penetration into the PMT region from the outer support part. So low PMT field level could be of any surprise because at the given iron field level the relative permeability of iron is very high for steel-08 ( \(\approx\)3000).

The result obtained is completely in compliance with the most recent independent calculation analogous to what was described in ref.[4]. But this time it has got the following features:

- all up-to-date parameters: coils geometry, the thicker iron of the support part and a new steel-08 B(H) table;

- actually pure 2D model ( infinite dimensions along Z-axis) and due to this much finer grid than in 3D calculation;

- the field level became \(\approx\) 5 Gauss at the PMT location;

This also confirms the result of the 2D POISCR calculations done in Dubna for the first time in April 1994 (Fig.5) with the PMT region field of \(\approx\) 1.5 Gauss. At this Fig. the point number corresponds to the PMT window serial number ( 1-st 3-rd, 5-th and 7-th window from left to right in the Fig.3)

Now we have the field level of more then TWO ORDERS of magnitude less than it has been estimated about one year ago and reported at the TILECAL - collaboration meeting (31-01-94 and 2-02-94) [4]. The reason for this dramatic change of the field level is modifications of the parameters and probably some methodological improvements in conducting the calculations.

### Edge of the Extended Barrel (\(Z_{max}\)-plane )

On the outer surface of iron exposed to the toroid stray field the maximum field value is \(\approx\) 15 kGauss there. This is \(\approx\) twice higher field level than in the middle of the Barrel part which could be explained by the Barrel toroid stray field flux lines attracting to the TileCal iron.

Due to the open PMT window at the edge of the Extended Barrel the outside rather large toroid field of \(\approx\) 1200 Gauss gradually decreasing from the edge (Z=614.6 cm) down along Z-axis inside the TileCal PMT windows (Fig.6).

### Shielding at the edge of the Extended Barrel

Having in mind the result of the previous section one should probably foresee some extra setup for the PMT shielding at the Extended Barrel edge where there the most high flux penetration to the PMT location occurs.

Naturally one can use the same 10 cm thick iron plate to close the open PMT window as it was successfully used for the outer radius of the support part. In the left part of Fig.2 one can notice the proposed shielding ring separating the PMT windows from the toroid stray field.

Of course the plate would be substantially magnetized ( \(\approx\) 20 kGauss) but the field inside the PMT window near the Extended Barrel edge became of no more than 6 Gauss now (Fig.7).

Nevertheless one should have in mind that the PMT location field level calculated here could become much higher when adding to what we have from the Barrel toroid an extra magnetization of the support part due to the solenoid and endcap toroids switched on.

## 4 Solenoid Switched on

Now we switch on the current only for the solenoid with the rest of the ATLAS coil system (Fig.1) without the current at all.

Iron surface maximum field value is in the support part inside the so called crack region [5] between the Barrel and Extended Barrel part of the TileCal. On the inner surface of the support the field is 10 kGauss and on the outer surface \(\approx\) 6 kGauss. This happens due to the return flux of the solenoid and has been already observed in the previous calculations with the help of the POISCR code [3].

Near the crack region (Z = 294.7 cm\(\div\)344.7 cm ) the PMTs location field is not more than 3 Gauss due to the support magnetization from the solenoid return flux (Fig.8). This result is quite new, produced first time with the present 3D-computer model and never has been known before.

Although this field is about an order of magnitude of one obtained with Barrel toroid the combined magnetization of the the support part from the toroid and solenoid could give a rapid rise of the PMT field in this area because of nonlinear effects in ferromagnetic material.

As toroid and solenoid induction vectors have always 90\({}^{0}\) angle between them one could expect in the worst case \(\approx\) 50 % of the total field level increase due to geometrical but not algebraic adding of the induction vectors in this region. In this case an approximate value of the total field value could be \(\approx\) 15 kGauss there. This field level seems to be still tolerable as the relative permeability of the steel-08 at this induction is still high (\(\approx\) 1000).

The situation also simplified a bit due to fact that the upper part of the support (in Fig.3) shields the PMT from the toroid stray field and the lower part conducts the solenoid return flux (separated functions device). Nevertheless in the nearest future this problem should be thoroughly investigated with both toroid and solenoid switched on simultaneously and more realistic iron presentation (packing factor and anisotropy) of the TileCal active sector.

At the April ATLAS week there was discussion concerning the problem of the crack region between the barrel and the extended barrel of the end-cap region [6]. Presently a gap of 50 cm is foreseen, bridged only partially by the structure connecting the flux returns at the outer radius. The tile calorimeter community brought up the question if this gap should be "plugged" with calorimetry, leaving of course sufficient space for services, cables and electronics for the detectors inside the Tile Calorimeter. Filling the gap would also be helpful to reduce neutron backgrounds to the muon chambers and the above mention problem with the PMT location field would be completely solved.

One could also insert more iron for the support part in the crack region. In the limiting case of filling the whole crack region with iron our calculation shows only 2 kGauss magnetization of iron near PMT location (5 times less then in the previous case). But in this case tile field can increase somewhat and some intermediate solution should be adopted then.

## 5 Barrel Toroid Stray Field Model

From the previous sections it became clear that to find out the PM location field with a desired level of accuracy it was necessary to perform calculations with the both Barrel toroid and solenoid switched on. But in this case one needs to include into consideration the total iron volume as there would not be any plane with the symmetry conditions assigned. The reason for this is already mentioned property of the toroid and solenoid induction vectors: they have always 90\({}^{\circ}\) angle between them.

This means an increase of the number of nodes on a factor of 32 comparing with the calculations done up to now which would make these work totally unrealistic. One should also take into account that the number of node was really at minimum for the calculations done before this moment.

We think that the way out would be to find some suitable approximation of the toroid stray field in the area of the TileCal support. In the Fig.9 one can observe that the toroid stray field shows 16 - poles behaviour in the region between the Barrel toroid and the TileCal, R = 4.2 m + 5.0 m. In this Fig. the length of vectors represents in relative units an induction value at the point. There only toroid exists in the system ( no iron, no other coils). In the support part the toroid stray field varies from 800 Gauss at R=380 cm to 2000 Gauss at R=420 cm.

To this end we propose to introduce the second Barrel toroid with the \(\varphi\)-shift on 22.5\({}^{\circ}\) and the opposite sign of current as compared with the real toroid. By this way we shall get 16 - poles symmetry of the field in the region between the Barrel toroid and TileCal.

To get the same field level at the outer support part radius 420 cm as with the real toroid it is necessary to adjust the Ampere-turns of the toroid stray field model. With 6.3 MAt in both toroids instead of 10.6 MAt for the real toroid ( \(\approx\) twice less current as now we have 2 toroids instead of one) we get the field distribution presented in Fig.10.

In the Fig. one can see that the field distribution resembles the one in Fig.9. But the radial lines at \(\varphi=90^{0}\pm 11.25^{0}\) have only the tangential field component and \(B_{\varphi}\equiv 0\) there. This will give the possibility to introduce there the region boundary with the normal derivative of scalar potential equal to zero for the TOSCA calculation with the Barrel toroid and solenoid on. With the real Barrel toroid this surface is not a plane and its position changes due to the TileCal iron influence on the field distribution.

Nevertheless it should be noted that the stray field of this model at radius 380 cm is a bit higher: 1000 Gauss instead of 800 Gauss for the real toroid. The field is also somehow redistributed along \(\varphi\)-coordinate go get desired condition \(B_{\varphi}\)=0 at the above mentioned plane.

Of course in the region of the muon system the field of this coils configuration is totally wrong, but we need to reproduce only the stray field of the Barrel toroid in the vicinity of the TileCal support. This aim was completely reached with this model.

With this stray field model it became possible to reduce the size of the iron region for the TOSCA calculation in 16 times: only \(22.5^{0}\) iron sector along \(\varphi\) can be included into the calculations. And there is more to it than that: one can now reduce the radius of the toroid outer leg and by this reduce the radial position of the far boundary of the model (the less space to be considered - the less number of nodes).

**6 3D TILECAL FIELD MODEL FUTURE DEVELOPMENT**

Now with the result of the previous section all is ready to start investigation of the combined action of the solenoid and Barrel toroid on the PMT location field.

To get more refinement to the results it is also necessary to introduce anisotropic iron with the packing factor to account for the tile structure of the TileCal iron.

Next step - introduction of the Endcap toroid stray field model (to be invented). But it should be mentioned the possibility to use the recently proposed 5 - 10 cm thick iron radiation shielding which is supposed to be installed between the Endcap toroid and TileCal. With this iron the endcap stray field would be completely isolated from the TileCal iron. Combined with the PMT window shielding at the edge of the Extended Barrel it would solve all the problems with the magnetic field level at the PMT and tile location.

Of course it would be nice to increase the number of nodes to the maximum possible with the PaRC quota (disk space and a reasonable run time) available to get an impression of the accuracy of the results for the finally constructed field model.

**7 CONCLUSION**

- Field value at the PMT location from the Barrel toroid stray field is not more than 4
- 6 Gauss at the TileCal which is \(\approx\) 300 times less than it has been considered before.

- The PMTs location field is not more than 3 Gauss due to the support magnetization from the solenoid return flux. This result is quite new, produced first time with the present 3D-computer model and never has been known before.

- One should probably foresee some extra setup for the PMT shielding at the Extended Barrel \(Z_{max}\) edge where there the most high flux penetration to the PMT location occurs.

- The obtained results should be confirmed by calculations with the combined action of the solenoid and toroids (Barrel and Endcap) and also by refining the computer model (packing factor, anisotropy, maximum possible number of nodes etc). - Due to obtained here results the problem of the individual PMTs shielding simplifies considerably and the drawers mechanics getting much simpler. Substantial saving of the material cost and manpower for R&D will take place. The decision could be taken to abandon the expensive high magnetic permeability material (\(\mu\)-metal) for the PMT shielding. - Other TileCal magnetic field questions enumerated in the ref.[3] are still waiting to be answered.

**ADDENDUM-I. Solenoid Parameters Modifications**

- Some general remarks:

* Due to various reasons it was interesting to use the 3D Atlas magnetic field model constructed here to calculate the effect of the solenoid parameters modification on the field uniformity within the Inner Detector (InDet) cavity.
* Figs. 11,12 and 13 show field level lines ( or zones ) with the increment between lines of \(\approx\) 1 kGauss. ( 22 lines from B=0 to \(B_{max}\), line number 1 corresponds to B=0. So to find out the field level identified by the line number N one should calculate like this: B=(N-1)\(\times\delta\)B, where \(\delta\)B-field step between two lines).
* Line number 21 shows the good field boundary (\(\approx\) 5 % nonuniformity near 20 kGauss level).
* In the Figs.11+13 the InDet cavity region is identified with the straight lines.
* Parameters of the solenoids and InDet cavity [7] are given in the following tables:

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|} \hline Solenoids & Normal & Large & Short \\ \hline Inner radius (m) & 1.23 & 2.00 & 1.23 \\ \hline Half length (m) & 3.15 & 2.575 & 2.65 \\ \hline Radial thickness (cm) & 1.28 & 1.28 & 1.28 \\ \hline Ampere-turns (MAt) & 10.6 & 10.12 & 8.92 \\ \hline Maximum field (kGauss) & 20.74 & 19.87 & 20.44 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|} \hline InDet cavity & & \\ \hline Radius (m) & 1.15 \\ \hline Half length (m) & 3.45 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

- Large solenoid

* Good field region inside the InDet region (Fig.12) shrank considerably from its both sides along Z-axis.
* Could be an increase of the tile field due to the larger flux branching in the direction of the Barrel part of the TileCal.
* Short solenoid
* Good field region inside the InDet region (Fig.13) shrank but still inside the InDet cavity region.
* Could be as for the large radius solenoid an increase of the tile field due to the larger flux branching in the direction of the Barrel part of the TileCal.
