The electromagnetic calorimeter of the ATLAS detector will use the liquid argon (LAr) sampling technique with Accordion geometry and fast readout [1]. The feasibility of this technology has been demonstrated by the RD3 Collaboration over the last four years by testing on beam two small size electromagnetic prototypes [2, 3, 4].

The further step was the construction of a large scale detector conceived as a sector of the ATLAS Barrel calorimeter, fully pointing toward the interaction centre and consisting of an electromagnetic and a hadronic section.

The prototypes were exposed to electron, pion and muon beams in three different periods (Autumn '92, Spring and September '93) on the H8 beam line of the SPS. The results of the tests will be discussed in detail in two forthcoming papers [5, 6].

In this Note we will concentrate on the response of the electromagnetic calorimeter to electrons with particular emphasis on:

* the performance of the readout chain (section 3).
* the energy resolution over the rapidity range \(\eta\leq 1\) and the possibility of maintaining the calorimeter performance at the same level over its angular coverage by suitably changing the absorber thickness (section 5).
* the uniformity of response over almost hundred cells with a determination of the overall constant term of the energy resolution (section 6).

## 2 The 2m Accordion prototype

_Detector structure_

The electromagnetic prototype is a stack of three mechanically independent azimuthal modules each one covering 9\({}^{\circ}\) in \(\phi\) and the pseudorapidity interval \(0\leq\eta\leq 1.08\) (more than 2 meters along the LHC beam line). It represents about 2.5% of the future ATLAS Barrel calorimeter. The detector is made of 73 absorber plates (1.8 mm of lead cladded in 0.2 mm of stainless steel by means of 100 \(\mu\)m of prepreg) alternated with 72 copper-Kapton readout electrodes. The LAr gap on either sides of the Kapton boards is 1.9 mm and the applied electric field 10 kV/cm.

While a converter plate extends over the full detector length, 5 Kapton circuits with different shape, each one of size \(\Delta\eta=0.216\), are needed to cover the calorimeter acceptance in \(\eta\).

The pointing structure in \(\phi\) was achieved by opening up the readout and absorber plates (accordion shaped) around the beam line. To ensure a constant thickness of the LAr gap along the detector depth, and therefore a constant sampling fraction, the bending angle of the accordion waves gradually changes from 87\({}^{\circ}\) to 111\({}^{\circ}\)1.

Footnote 1: In a previous small size prototype with semi-projective geometry [4] the absorber plates had a constant folding angle. This produced a degradation of the constant term of the energy resolution due to the variation of the sampling fraction with depth.

#### Granularity

The prototype is longitudinally divided into three samplings (front, middle, back) of about 9, 9 and 7 \(X_{0}\) respectively, giving a total thickness of 25 \(X_{0}\) at \(\eta\)=0.

The transverse granularity is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.018\times 0.020\) in the first two samplings and twice coarser in \(\eta\) in the third one 2.

The segmentation in \(\eta\) was obtained by etching projective pads on the conductive layers of the electrodes (top of fig. 1) while in \(\phi\) three consecutive Kapton circuits are read out through the same preamplifier.

#### Change of the absorber thickness with \(\eta\)

At large \(\eta\) the sampling frequency \(f\) of the calorimeter decreases, therefore for a given sampling fraction the stochastic term of the energy resolution would increase as [7]

\[\sigma_{samp}\propto\frac{1}{\sqrt{f}}\propto\frac{1}{\sqrt{\sin\theta}} \tag{1}\]

where \(\theta\) is defined in fig. 1. However since for a fixed thickness of the active gap \(\sigma_{samp}\) scales also as

\[\sigma_{samp}\propto\sqrt{t_{abs}} \tag{2}\]

Figure 1: _Top: R\(\theta\) view of the prototype showing the longitudinal and the \(\eta\) segmentation. Bottom: front view of the detector showing the frontend electronics equipment. Only part of the prototype (indicated in the figure) was equipped for the beam test._

where \(t_{ab}\), is the thickness of the absorber plates expressed in radiation lengths, the sampling term can be kept constant over the full calorimeter coverage by suitably modifying the converter composition as a function of \(\eta\). In the 2m prototype the lead thickness in the absorber plates was reduced from 1.8 to 1.2 mm for \(\eta\geq 0.7\). Two more stainless steel foils and prepreg layers were then inserted to leave the overall plate thickness unchanged.

#### Signal processing

In each sampling of the calorimeter the readout was organized in 15 blocks: 3 modules in \(\phi\) and 5 sectors in \(\eta\), the latter corresponding to the 5 different Kapton electrodes (see fig. 1 bottom). Each block contains \(12\times 8\) cells in \(\eta\times\phi\) in the first two samplings and \(6\times 8\) in the last one. For the beam test only 2000 out of 3600 channels were fully equipped.

Three different options for the frontend electronics, already tested with previous prototypes, were adopted:

* charge preamplifiers working at the LAr temperature and based on 1. Silicon JFETs [8] or 2. GaAs MESFETs [9]
* warm current preamplifiers (the so called "0T" scheme, meaning no transistor in the cold [10])

To allow for a fast charge transfer in the first two cases the preamplifiers were mounted directly on the front and back face of the calorimeter. New developments in this direction (a monolithic version of the GaAs preamplifier will be tested in July '94) are described elsewhere [11].

In the 0T scheme the signal is sent from the calorimeter to a warm current preamplifier placed outside the cryostat through a 50 \(\Omega\) cable.

The preamplifier output was shaped with a \((CR)^{2}(RC)^{3}\) bipolar filter working at room temperature. The peaking time \(t_{p}(\delta)\) of the shaped response to a short current pulse was 18 ns, corresponding to about 35 ns to the triangular ionization signal from the detector.

The time costant of the filter was chosen in such a way as to minimize the total noise in the calorimeter (electronic plus pile-up). The estimate of the pile-up noise however suffers from uncertainties on the machine luminosity and on the nature of the soft interactions at the LHC. The lower value now foreseen for the luminosity would favour a somewhat slower shaping of the signal than presently adopted. In this case the equivalent electronic noise, scaling as \(t_{p}^{-3/2}\), would also be reduced.

The shapers were followed by track and hold (T&H) circuits, whose hold signal was generated by a beam or by a calibration trigger and whose timing was adjusted to sample the shaper signal near its maximum. The output was then digitized by a 12-bit charge integrating ADC.

#### Calibration system

The calibration system of the electromagnetic calorimeter is extensively described in [5]. Only the main features will be recalled here.

Two independent methods were used.

In the "warm" system (fig. 2), which was used in the whole detector, the signal from a 12-channel pulse generator was shaped outside the cryostat to give an exponential decay (risetime less than 1 ns, decay constant about 400 ns) thus reproducing, for short shaping times, the triangular signal from the calorimeter. The test pulses were fed through 12-channel AXONcables to a set of distribution networks mounted on one side of the calorimeter where they were splitted into 4. Each pulse was then sent to an injection network mounted on a given motherboard which distributed the calibration signal to 6 preamplifiers (out of the 24 mounted on a motherband) through precision injection resistors of 2 K\(\Omega\).

In the "cold" system, used only in the 0T region, the signal was fanned out inside the cryostat and shaped directly on the motherboards.

In the following we will refer only to the warm system.

## 3 Performance of the readout chain

The calibration system is used to correct for the different electronic gains of the various channels by measuring their response to known amounts of charge injected at the preamplifier input. It is also useful to determine the cross-talk between adjacent channels and to monitor the time stability of the readout chain.

The calibration of the calorimeter consists of two steps:

1. timing of the detector
2. determination of the calibration coefficients for each channel by fitting the ADC output as a function of the test pulse amplitude

In the following sections these points will be discussed in detail.

Figure 2: _Sketch of the warm calibration system._

### Timing

Both the calibration and the physics signal produced by an incident particle must be timed in such a way that the shaper response of each channel is sampled at its maximum by the T&H circuit.

The timing of the calorimeter is a two-fold procedure:

1. In a first step (timing of the calibration) the strobe to the T&H is timed with respect to the peak of the calibration pulse. For this end the peaking time for a same input test pulse is evaluated channel by channel by means of a computer controlled delay box. The shaper response is sampled in a window of 60 ns with steps of 1.5 ns, and the peaking time is determined by a quadratic interpolation in the region of the maximum. The speed of response depends on two factors: the performance of the frontend electronics and the cell capacitance (a larger capacitance slows down the signal). The intrinsic peaking time dispersion of a given readout scheme is however rather modest (1-2 ns rms, see table 1) and the cell dimensions are quite uniform in each sampling of a given readout block. Therefore average peaking times are first calculated inside the various blocks and samplings and the results are then equalized to the overall mean value by inserting suitable delay cables. Finally the T&H strobe is adjusted to sample the calibration signal at its maximum. The achievable accuracy is about 1 ns.
2. In a second step (timing of the physics) the electronic chain is timed with respect to the incident particles by looking for the relative delay between the physics trigger and the

Figure 3: _Calibrated shaper response to a test pulse for a group of channels read out with Silicon preamplifiers. The individual channels have been equalized at \(t=0\) (T&H strobe), which was adjusted to the average of the distribution of the peaking times (hatched histogram)._T&H strobe which maximizes the calorimeter response to a physics signal (usually the reconstructed energy of an electromagnetic shower). The achievable accuracy in this case is somewhat lower (1-2 ns).

Due to the fast and narrow shape of the calorimeter response the timing of the detector is quite difficult. This is shown in fig. 3, where the calibrated response to the test pulse is plotted as a function of time for a group of channels. The average peaking time corresponds fairly well to the T&H strobe (\(t=0\)) where the calibration coefficients are evaluated and the channels are equalized by definition. A few channels appear to be slower by up to 6-8 ns, in most cases due to a bad preamplifier (they were replaced for the following run). It can be seen that if the physics signal were not synchronous with the calibration (i.e. away from \(t\)=0) the interchannel dispersion would be large. For instance an asynchrony of \(\pm 1\) (\(\pm 2\)) ns would induce an rms dispersion at the level of 0.1% (0.4%) even excluding the slowest channels.

The collected data allowed to verify that the relative timing between the calibration and the physics signal was within 1-2 ns depending on the electronics region. This value probably represents the ultimate accuracy of such a procedure.

In the future experiment this delicate method will probably not be needed. Techniques for the determination of the amplitude and timing information of the shaped signal based on multiple sampling of the shaper output and on the optimal weighting of the samples exist [12, 13] and should allow to achieve a better accuracy than a single sample.

### Calibration

Once the electronic chain has been correctly timed, calibration coefficients are determined by fitting the response of each channel to the test pulse with a third-order polynomial in the energy range 0-160 GeV.

The average sensitivity of the electronic chain in electron energy scale is shown in table 1 for the three readout schemes. The linearity is good, the second order correction amounting to 2% at 50 GeV. The residual rms spread of the channel-to-channel calibrated response is of the order of 0.2% above 50 GeV, resulting in a 0.15% contribution to the constant term of the energy resolution (see section 6.3).

### Noise, coherent noise

The noise observed in the calorimeter comes mainly from the preamplifier noise, which is proportional to the cell capacitance and therefore scales as \(1/\sin\theta\) with the rapidity. The measured noise, typically 50-60 MeV per channel, was similar for the three electronics (table 1).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & sampling & Si PA & GaAs PA & 0T \\ \hline gain (MeV/count) & 1 & 40 & 40 & 45 \\  & 2 & 40 & 40 & 55 \\  & 3 & 45 & 45 & 60 \\ \hline uncoherent noise (MeV) & 1 & 45 & 45 & 45 \\  & 2 & 55 & 65 & 50 \\  & 3 & 70 & 80 & 65 \\ \hline coherent noise (MeV) & 1,2 & 2-3 & 2-3 & 5-6 \\ \hline \(t_{p}\) rms dispersion (ns) & 1,2 & 1.5 & 1.5 & \(<1\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Main parameters of the electronic chain_The total electronic noise in a region of \(n\) channels can be written as

\[\sigma_{tot}=\sqrt{n\sigma_{u}^{2}+n(n-1)\sigma_{c}^{2}} \tag{3}\]

where \(\sigma_{u}\) (\(\sigma_{c}\)) is the average uncoherent (coherent) noise in one channel. In order to estimate the level of coherent noise in the calorimeter, we considered the variation of \(\sigma_{tot}\) when increasing the number of channels \(n\). Figure 4 shows the results for the Silicon and the 0T electronics. In both cases the total noise is larger than expected from a purely uncoherent source.

By fitting the data points with equation (3) the coherent noise was estimated to be about 2.5 (5) MeV in the Silicon (0T) case. Therefore in a calorimeter region needed to contain an electromagnetic shower (typically \(3\times 3\) towers) the coherent noise is negligible.

### Stability with time

The time stability of the electronic chain over 60 hours is shown in fig. 5. A region corresponding to the central modules of the first two sectors is considered here (channels 9 \(-\) 16 in \(\phi\) and 1 \(\rightarrow\) 24 in \(\eta\), in the front compartment only). The discontinuity in the left part of the figure is related to a contingent hardware problem: if the corresponding points are excluded, the calibration parameters are stable to within \(\pm 0.1\%\) rms.

### Cross-talk

As explained in section 2 the motherboards are equipped with a set of calibration networks which allow for a common test pulse to be distributed to six preamplifiers (fig. 2). To allow for

Figure 4: _Total electronic noise \(\sigma_{tot}\) (in units of \(\sigma_{u}\)) as a function of the number of channels for two different frontend electronics. The points are fitted as explained in the text (solid lines). The dashed line corresponds to the expected behaviour in case of a purely random noise._

Figure 5: _Time stability of the electronic chain over a period of about 60 hours in the region read out with Silicon preamplifiers (open circles: sector 1; closed circles: sector 2). All points represent an average over 96 channels in the first sampling. Top: gains; middle: pedestals; bottom: noise. The dashed lines indicate the midnight._

cross-talk studies, these six preamplifiers are uniformly spaced on the board, so that only one every four is pulsed with the same network and at the same time. Therefore the cross-talk can be determined by comparing the response amplitude of a channel to a test pulse delivered in the channel itself or in an adjacent one.

#### Cross-talk in the Kapton circuits

The main cross-talk source in the detector arised from a coupling between channels of the middle and back samplings due to a mistake in the design of the Kapton electrodes, while the cross-talk between adjacent channels in the front and middle compartment was usually much smaller. A new batch of circuits will be mounted in the prototype for the test of July '94.

The cross-talk level could be precisely determined in all cases indicated in the left part of fig. 6 with the method mentioned above. The results obtained in various regions of the prototype are summarized in table 2. It can be seen that the cross-talk is more important in the region read out through the 0T scheme due to the larger input impedance.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline electronics & \(F-F\) & \(M-M\) & \(M\to B\) \\ \hline Si PA & \((-0.3\pm 0.4)\%\) & \((-0.4\pm 0.6)\%\) & \((+3\pm 1)\%\) \\ GaAs PA & \((-0.2\pm 0.3)\%\) & \((-0.2\pm 0.6)\%\) & \((+3\pm 1)\%\) \\

The upper curve is the calibrated response of a back channel to a fixed test pulse, while the bottom curve is the cross–talk signal in the same channel when the middle channel in front of it is pulsed._

### Correction method

The effect of the cross-talk can be made almost negligible by means of a conceptually simple offline correction based on the cross-talk levels measured in calibration runs.

Consider the energy \(E_{k}\) (\(k=1,2,3\)) deposited in three adjacent channels. If \(c_{ij}\) is the cross-talk from channel \(j\) to channel \(i\), the energy \(E_{k}^{m}\) actually measured in the three channels can be expressed in a matrix form as

\[(E_{1},\ E_{2}\ E_{3})^{m}=\left(\begin{array}{ccc}1&c_{12}&0\\ c_{21}&1&c_{23}\\ 0&c_{32}&1\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}E_{1}\\ E_{2}\\ E_{3}\end{array}\right)\ \ \ \mbox{or}\ \ \ E^{m}=CE \tag{4}\]

Only first order effects were considered. The total signal was assumed to be conserved, whereas the \(C\) matrix was not required to be symmetric. The true energy can be easily found by inverting \(C\):

\[E=C^{-1}E^{m} \tag{5}\]

The extension to a higher number of channels is straightforward.

Figure 7: _Energy measured in the calorimeter for 287 GeV electrons before (dashed histograms) and after (hatched histograms) the correction for the cross–talk._The relative importance of the cross-talk increases with the electron energy, due to the better intrinsic resolution of the calorimeter and to the larger fraction of energy released in the second sampling (the cross-talk \(M\) -- \(B\) is the dominant one). The effect of the correction for 287 GeV electrons is presented in fig. 7. While the energy measured in the first two samplings was essentially unaffected by the cross-talk, the signal in the back compartment could be overestimated by a factor 1.5. The net effect on the energy resolution was however rather modest while the influence on the uniformity of response is discussed in section 6.

Slower channels, as suggested by the right part of fig. 6, are in general more affected by the cross-talk. In this case an accurate correction is particularly needed. Moreover if the physics and the calibration signals are not perfectly synchronous, the correction for the cross-talk, which is based on calibration runs, is not accurate. For example it has been estimated that the middle-to-back cross-talk in the physics data can be different from that measured in the calibration data by 0.5% on average for a timing offset of 1.5 ns (and even more for slow channels).

#### Cross-talk in the injection networks

The distribution system of the calibration signals has been recently found to be affected by faulty resistive injection networks [14]. Half of the channels in each motherboard receive, due to an extra coupling capacitance, a faster (1-2 ns) and higher (0.25%) calibration pulse.

This can be seen by looking at the distribution of the peaking times obtained from a calibration timing run (fig. 8). The bad channels have an average peaking time about 1.5 ns faster than the good ones. New injection networks will be used for the July '94 run. No offline correction could be applied to the present data.

## 4 Test beam setup

In this second part of the Note we will present the perfomance of the 2m Accordion prototype based on the analysis of electron data in the energy range 10 to 287 GeV collected during the

Figure 8: _The peaking time for a group of bad (faster) and good channels in the region equipped with the OT._

first two test periods (Autumn '92 and Spring '93).

For the runs the calorimeter was installed inside a cryostat consisting of a 1.2 mm thick Aluminum outer wall followed by 30 cm of low density foam and by a 8 mm thick stainless steel inner vessel. The total amount of passive material in front of the prototype, including the cryostat, some inactive liquid argon between the cryostat cold wall and the calorimeter, cables and supports, was about 1 \(X_{0}\) at \(\eta\)=0. This material increased as \(1/\sin\theta\) along the calorimeter length, where \(\theta\) is the polar angle defined in fig. 1.

The electromagnetic module was followed, inside the same cryostat, by a prototype of a Fe-LAr hadronic calorimeter [6] which had also an Accordion geometry.

The cryostat was mounted on a computer controlled platform which could be rotated in the two directions (\(\eta\), \(\phi\)) in such a way that the beam could hit each cell along its projective axis, as it would happen with particles originating at the nominal interaction centre in a real collider experiment. The platform movement allowed to scan the prototype over almost its full angular coverage.

The beam line was equipped with three proportional wire chambers, which allowed to determine the direction of the incident particles and their impact point on the calorimeter, and with four scintillation counters, two of which used in the trigger. The information from the chambers and the scintillators was also used in the analysis to select clean electron events.

At the calorimeter front face the beam spot typically covered one cell (\(\sim 2\times 2\) cm\({}^{2}\)). The momentum spread at high energy was kept at the level of 0.3%.

Figure 9 gives a view of the data sample considered for this study. This sample includes:

* three energy scans in the range 10 to 287 GeV, one at small rapidity (Sector 2, \(\eta\)=0.28), the

Figure 9: _Partial calorimeter map showing the region were the data presented in this Note were taken. Black points: cells covered by the position scan. Open point: cell where one of the energy scans was taken. The meaning of the letters is explained in section 6._

two others, not shown in the figure, at intermediate (Sector 3, \(\eta\)=0.5) and large rapidity (Sector 5, \(\eta\)=0.9)
* a position scan at fixed energy (287 GeV) taken in the region read out with Silicon preamplifiers 3 which allowed to study the response uniformity of the detector over 113 cells. Position scan data were also collected in the GaAs and in the 0T region. They have been discussed elsewhere [15, 16].

Footnote 3: To study the boundary between the two uppermost modules, one line in the OT region (\(\phi\)=17) was also considered.

## 5 Energy response to electrons

### Reconstruction of the electron shower

The electron shower was reconstructed in the first two samplings of the calorimeter by adding the energy contained in a matrix of 3\(\times\)3 cells around the channel with the highest signal. In the third compartment, with twice coarser \(\eta\)-granularity, only 2\(\times\)3 cells in \(\eta\times\phi\) were considered. This allowed to reduce the contribution of the electronic noise, which is particularly critical at low energy.

From now on we will improperly call "nonet" this region consisting-of 24 cells. The nonet typically contains 94% of the shower energy, slightly decreasing with energy, but has the advantage, compared to a larger size cluster (5\(\times\)5 cells), of contributing 40% less electronic and pile-up noise.

The energy fractions released by electrons of various energies in the three samplings of the calorimeter are shown in fig. 10. As expected the shower becomes "longer" with increasing energy.

The electron impact point was reconstructed in the two directions (\(\eta\), \(\phi\)) as

Figure 10: Fraction of energy released in the three compartments of the calorimeter as a function of the beam energy for electrons impinging at \(\eta\)=0.28.

\[\overline{x}=\frac{\overline{\Sigma_{i}x_{i}E_{i}}}{\Sigma_{i}E_{i}} \tag{6}\]

where \(E_{i}\) and \(x_{i}\) are the energy and position of the \(i\)-th cell and the sum runs over the cells belonging to the nonet in the first sampling. From now on when talking about the electron position in the calorimeter we will always mean the position reconstructed by the calorimeter itself as indicated in the above formula.

### Response variation with the impact point

The variation of the calorimeter response with the particle position can be attributed to two reasons: the mechanical structure of the detector and imperfections in the channel-to-channel equalization. In this section we will discuss the first point, while the second one will be treated in section 6.

#### 5.2.1 versus \(\eta\)

Figure 11 (left) shows the energy response as a function of \(\eta\) over two cells for 287 GeV electrons.

It can be seen that the response is maximum for particles hitting the centre of a cell and decreases toward the cell edges, where the drop is 2.5%. This can be attributed in part to cluster effects (the lateral leakage outside the nonet increases away from the centre of the impact cell) and in part to possible modifications of the electric field due to the presence of a 1 mm wide insulating strips which separates adjacent \(\eta\) cells on the Kapton board.

The \(\eta\) dependence of the energy response over a large area (two calorimeter sectors) is shown in the right part of fig. 11. Superimposed is the function which was used to correct for it

Figure 11: Energy response (normalized to the mean value) as a function of the particle impact point in \(\eta\) for 287 GeV electrons. Left: over two cells. Right: over the first two sectors of the calorimeter (integrated over all scanned \(\phi\) rows).

\[f_{\eta}=A\cdot\eta^{2}+B\cdot\sin\left[\frac{\pi}{2}\cdot(2\eta)^{C}\right] \tag{7}\]

where \(\eta\) is expressed in cell units. It can be seen that the normalization varies from cell to cell due to non-uniformities in the calorimeter response. The correction, which was determined globally over all scanned cells (see fig. 9), makes flat the response in a given cell with respect to the centre of that cell, but of course does not equalize this channel-to-channel variation.

Figure 11 also shows that at the border between two different Kapton boards, i.e. between cell \(\eta=12\) and cell \(\eta=13\), the response drops by 8%. This can be attributed to the larger separation between these two cells due in part to a wider insulation regions (2 mm instead of 1 mm) and in part to the shrinking of the Kapton electrodes in the cold. This effect, which could be avoided with Kapton boards extending over the full (or at least half) calorimeter coverage, was corrected with a third order polynomial, the same for all \(\phi\) rows.

#### 5.2.2 versus \(\phi\)

The variation of the calorimeter response with \(\phi\) is shown in the top part of fig. 12 in a region far from the boundary between two mechanically independent modules.

As for the \(\eta\) case the energy is maximum at the cell centre and decreases toward the edges. However the total drop is less than in \(\eta\), since in this case there is no physical separation between adjacent cells and the effect is only due to the limited size of the cluster. Superimposed to this trend one can observe a periodical modulation of peak-to-peak amplitude 1% and rms 0.5%, which is due to the variation of the calorimeter sampling fraction (traversed amount of LAr) as a function of \(\phi\)[2], inherent to the Accordion structure. It can be seen that with a proper choice of the mechanical parameters of the detector this modulation can be kept at the level observed in a previous non pointing prototype [3].

The response variation versus \(\phi\) shown in fig. 12 was parametrized with the following function

\[f_{\phi}=\alpha\cdot\phi^{2}+\beta\cdot\sin(6\pi\phi-\frac{\pi}{2})+\gamma \cdot\sin(12\pi\phi+\pi) \tag{8}\]

where the first term takes into account the cluster effect.

The above correction was used for all cells and since the Accordion modulation is essentially energy independent (see bottom part of fig. 12), also for all electron energies.

After correction the (residual) modulation has an rms of 0.3%.

The \(\phi\) response over the whole scanned region, between row \(\phi=7\) and row \(\phi=17\), is shown in fig. 13. A large part of the central module and the two boundary regions between mechanically independent modules of the stack are covered.

An expanded view of the boundary between the two uppermost modules is given in the bottom part of fig. 13. This region corresponds also to the transition between two different electronics: Si preamplifiers and 0T.

Away from the two singular regions the modulation described before is visible. The response starts decreasing at a distance of one cell from the module edge and reaches a total drop of about 2.5% at the boundary.

This behaviour is consistent with measurements of the mechanical uniformity of the stack performed at warm during the assembling of the prototype [17]. The capacitance of several double gaps, each one consisting of one Kapton board and the two absorber plates on its opposite sides, i.e. one third of a readout channel, was measured. The stack was fully scanned in \(\phi\) from top to bottom at four different vertical lines. The results are shown in fig. 14.

It can be seen that at the boundary between modules the capacitance is 6-7% lower than elsewhere, thus the LAr gap there is thicker by the same factor. Away from these regions the Figure 12: _Energy response (normalized to the mean value) as a function of the particle impact point in \(\phi\). Top: for 287 GeV electrons (integrated over \(\eta\)). Bottom: for electrons of various energies.._

Figure 13: _Energy response (normalized to the mean value) as a function of the particle impact point in \(\phi\) for 287 GeV electrons. Top: over the full region covered by the scan (integrated over \(\eta\)). The vertical lines indicate the position of the boundaries between modules.

rms of the capacitances is 1.4%, which means a dispersion of 55 \(\mu\)m in the thickness of the double gaps 4. When grouping together three consecutive gaps to form a readout cell the rms of the capacitances reduces to 0.9%.

Footnote 4: This result is close to the design tolerances [18].

The calorimeter response uniformity is expected to be better than the mechanical uniformity quoted above because in conditions of fast shaping the collected charge (\(Q\)) depends only weakly on the gap thickness.

In a noble liquid calorimeter

\[Q=\rho g\left(\frac{t_{m}}{t_{D}}-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{t_{m}}{t_{D}}\right)^ {2}\right) \tag{9}\]

where \(\rho\) is the linear charge density, \(g\) the gap thickness, \(t_{m}\) the effective integration time (\(\sim\)40 ns in our case) and \(t_{D}\) the electron drift time (\(\sim\)400 ns in our case).

For fast shaping (\(t_{m}<<t_{D}\)) the previous formula becomes

\[Q\simeq\rho g\frac{t_{m}}{t_{D}}=\rho g\frac{t_{m}}{g}v_{D} \tag{10}\]

where \(v_{D}\) is the electron drift velocity. Since

\[v_{D}\times E^{1/8}\times g^{-1/8} \tag{11}\]

then

\[Q\times g^{-1/3} \tag{12}\]

(fig. 16). The absolute energy scale was determined at 100 GeV. The two dashed lines in fig. 16 indicate the uncertainty on the nominal beam momentum [19]

\[\frac{\Delta(P)}{P}=\frac{25}{P}\%\oplus 0.5\% \tag{13}\]

where the first term is related to hysteresis effects in the bending magnets and the second term includes calibration and geometrical uncertainties. For example the apparently lower response of the calorimeter to 20 GeV electrons, which is common to the three positions of incidence, is probably due to a beam momentum systematically lower than the nominal value.

The error bars in the figure include an estimate of the beam rectifier stability (\(4.5\%/P\)) and the statistical error.

The calorimeter response is linear to within \(\pm 1\%\) for the three different rapidities. Clearly a better knowledge of the absolute beam momentum would be needed for more precise considerations.

### Energy resolution

The energy resolution of the calorimeter is shown in fig. 17 as a function of the beam momentum.

The results refer to electrons impinging at \(\eta=0.28\) and \(\eta=0.90\). The data collected in the region read out with GaAs preamplifiers (\(\eta=0.50\)) were not used in this case due to a problem (solved in the following runs) in the input stage of the hybrids which gave rise to a large electronic noise. After subtracting the contribution of the beam momentum spread the data points were fitted with the form

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\ \widehat{\div}\ \frac{b}{E}\ \widehat{\div}\ c \tag{14}\]

where the three addends are the sampling, the noise and the constant term respectively and \(E\) is expressed in GeV. The results of the fit are given in the table below.

_Comparison with the cartesian prototype_

The resolution of the 2m prototype at \(\eta=0.28\) (almost orthogonal incidence) can be compared with the results obtained with a previous Accordion prototype with non pointing geometry [3], which are also reported in the table above. Due to the essentially identical sampling fraction and frequency of the two detectors, the measured stochastic terms are the same within the errors. The constant term, which is mainly due to the residual Accordion modulation on a local scale (over one cell), is also similar in the two cases, thus demonstrating that the Accordion concept can be adapted to a fully pointing geometry without any loss in performance. The contribution of the electronic noise, about 300 MeV, is consistent with the value obtained from the pedestal widths for an array of \(3\times 3\) towers.

Figure 17: _Fractional energy resolution as a function of beam energy (beam momentum spread unfolded) for electrons hitting the calorimeter at \(\eta=0.28\) (closed circles) and \(\eta=0.90\) (open circles). The parameters of the fits (see text) are also indicated._

prototype behind the electromagnetic module. In fact if a tight cut is applied on the energy deposited in the hadronic calorimeter the shape of the spectrum becomes fairly gaussian (fig. 18 right).

The effect of the longitudinal leakage on the quality of the spectrum is estimated in more detail in fig. 19, which shows the fraction of events in the tail (i.e. events with energy below 2.5 \(\sigma\) from the mean) and the resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter when the cut on the signal seen in the hadronic calorimeter is gradually tightened.

From fig. 19 one can also estimate the contribution to the energy resolution from the fluctuations of the shower longitudinal containment by comparing the resolutions obtained when no cut or the tightest cut are applied. This contribution is \(0.25\pm 0.05\%\) at 287 GeV. The same result was deduced by looking at the improvement in the resolution when adding the energy released in the hadronic prototype to the electromagnetic energy.

Therefore the constant term estimated by fitting the data with to equation (14), which is mainly determined by the highest energy point, is not only due to the local non-uniformity of the detector response since it also includes the contribution from the longitudinal fluctuations of the shower development.

Note that a few events (0.8%) survive also to the tightest cut on the hadronic leakage (fig. 19 right). Even if the poor statistics prevents from a full understanding of their origin, they seem to be due to:

* electrons having an impact point in \(\phi\) corresponding to the minima of the response modulation where the parametrization used for the correction does not allow for a complete recovery, or
* electrons with a particularly large lateral leakage, as suggested by the fact that if a \(5\times 5\) matrix of towers is used instead of a \(3\times 3\) cluster the tail is halved.

#### Energy resolution at large \(\eta\)

The results obtained at \(\eta=0.90\), that is in the region with thinner lead in the absorber plates, were used to explore the calorimeter behaviour at large rapidity.

The increase of the sampling term from 9.99% to 10.42% is compatible with the prediction of the scaling law mentioned in section 2 (10.23%), while with a constant absorber thickness this term would become as large as 11.7%. The higher electronic noise is consistent with the increase in the cell capacitance (\(C\propto 1/\sin\theta\)). The better longitudinal containment of the shower at \(\eta=0.9\), where the total thickness of the calorimeter is about 29 \(X_{0}\), can explain the slightly lower constant term.

In conclusion the sampling term of the energy resolution can be kept under control as a function of rapidity by suitably reducing the absorber composition. This result however holds

only in a setup with a modest amount of dead material in front of the calorimeter.

## 6 Uniformity of response

After having discussed the intrinsic Accordion performance by looking at the calorimeter behaviour in one cell, we will now describe the detector response over a relatively large area and try to identify possible sources (mechanics, calibration) of non-uniformity contributing to the overall constant term of the energy resolution.

For this purpose we looked at scan data taken with 287 GeV electrons over 113 cells in the region shown in fig. 9. Events collected in the dead channel {\(\eta\)=11, \(\phi\)=13} (indicated with "D" in fig. 9) and in the nearby spots were not considered. A run taken with bad settings of the beam magnets was also discarded (labelled "B" in fig. 9).

In each of the remaining spots the response variation with the impact point in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) was corrected as described in section 5.2. The same correction functions with the same parameters were used everywhere. The singular regions (boundary between two \(\eta\) sectors or between two \(\phi\) modules) were also treated as discussed in section 5.2.

The average response of each cell was determined as the mean value from a Gaussian fit to the energy spectrum for all electrons hitting that cell. The resulting distribution of the mean values for all spots has an rms of about 0.9%. The rms is 1% before the correction for the cross-talk.

The further step was to understand those spots whose response was far from the average.

* most of the cells belonging to the rows \(\phi\)=9,10 in the middle compartment of Sector 1 gave a response a few GeV larger than the average and had a peaking time slower by 8 ns. Since these cells were distributed according to the calibration pattern (one every four in \(\eta\)), the reason was attributed to a bad coaxial cable bringing the calibration signal from the splitter located at one end of the detector to the relevant motherboard (see fig. 2). Due to this bad cable the test pulse arrived later so that the T&H sampled the shaper output before the maximum. The resulting gain was therefore higher (more MeV per ADC count). Since however these channels behaved normally with the physics signal, the higher gain wrongly assigned during the calibration procedure artificially raised the amount of seen energy.

Measurements done on the detector at warm [20] indicated that the gain of these channels was typically 12% higher than the others. Such a factor, which also optimized the energy resolution in these cells, was therefore used in the offline analysis as a correction.

For a following test this and a few other faulty cables were replaced.

* a group of spots were affected by the presence of two cells in the second compartment ("V" in fig. 9) with a measured energy significantly lower than the average. These channels however responded normally to the calibration pulse, hence suggesting a problem inside the detector. Its origin was understood by comparing the energy contained in the bad channels as a function of the particle impact point in \(\phi\) (one example is shown in fig. 20) with the response of good cells. In the latter case the energy is maximum for electrons hitting the cell centre and minimum at the edges. Also a sort of Accordion modulation is visible. On the other hand in the bad channel the energy content is lower for electrons hitting the first third of the cell, corresponding to the position of the first of the three electrodes grouped in the readout channel, while almost normally at the centre and at the upper edge.

This trend suggested that the first Kapton of the bad cell did not receive the High Voltage supply, probably due to a broken connection. Since the HV is distributed on either side of each electrode in an independent way, probably only one of the two connections was faulty, as suggested by the fact that the fraction of energy missing in the bad cell was about 1/6 of the expected content. A similar behaviour was observed for the other bad cell.

After having most likely 8 identified the problem, the two bad spots and the adjacent ones were removed from the data sample. In fact if a failure in the HV distribution system will occur somewhere in the future detector it will be possible to correct for it, at least partially, by using a parametrization of the energy deposition as a function of the impact point.

Footnote 8: This hypothesis could not be directly verified yet because the calorimeter was never dismounted since the first assembling.

The distribution of the mean energies for the remaining 96 spots is shown in fig. 21 as a function of \(\eta\). Most of the points are contained within \(\pm 1\%\) from the average. The rms is now 0.58%.

There is some indication for a systematic trend in \(\eta\), the response being higher at the sector ends than in the middle. At the boundary between adjacent Kaptons two competing effects are present: the dominant one is the weaker electric field, which produces the 8% response drop shown in the right part of fig. 11, the second one is the larger amount of liquid argon due to the already mentioned shrinking of the Kapton boards at cold. Actually fig. 11 shows that at

the Kapton edges the response increases before dropping. The available data however do not allow to fully understand if this is the only explanation of the response trend with \(\eta\) or if other sources contribute.

### Overall constant term

A major concern when designing and building the 2m prototype was the constant term, which according to the ATLAS LoI specifications [21] should be kept smaller than 1% over the full coverage of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

The first contribution to this term comes from the local (over one cell) constant term, which is mainly related to the intrinsic detector geometry (for instance the Accordion modulation in \(\phi\)). This local constant term has been discussed previously and amounts to 0.35\(\pm\)0.04% at \(\eta\)=0.28.

A second contribution comes from the variation of the detector response from cell to cell due to mechanical and electronic non-uniformities.

The position scan data introduced in the previous section allow to determine the overall constant term of the calorimeter, including both local and large scale effects.

For this end we considered the global energy spectrum for the 96 "good" spots of the scan (fig. 22). The plot contains about 150000 electron events. A Gaussian fit in the range {-2\(\sigma\), +\(\infty\)} 6 gives a resolution of

Footnote 6: On the left side of the spectrum the fit has been stopped at -2\(\sigma\) from the peak because of a low energy tail which is due to the quality of the beam, as demonstrated in section 6.2.

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=(0.93\pm 0.03)\% \tag{15}\]

after subtraction of the beam momentum spread.

The constant term can be easily extracted from this result by quadratically unfolding the sampling and the noise terms according to equation (14). However there are other effects contributing to the resolution which are energy dependent and therefore should not be included in what is properly meant by "costant" term of a calorimeter. These are

1. fluctuations of the longitudinal shower leakage behind the calorimeter
2. fluctuations of the lateral shower containment in the nonet
3. fluctuations of the energy deposited in the dead material in front of the calorimeter

The first effect, which increases with energy and dominates the resolution in the TeV region, amounts to 0.25% at 287 GeV in the region of the scan as discussed before.

The second effect gives a contribution of about 0.15% to the energy resolution for 287 GeV electrons. This number was estimated by comparing the resolution measured in the same spot when using a 3\(\times\)3 or a 5\(\times\)5 cluster (after unfolding the electronic noise which is different in the two cases).

Finally the third effect, whose importance decreases with energy, was evaluated with a Monte Carlo simulation 7 of the test beam setup and was found to be negligible (\(<0.05\%\)) at 287 GeV.

Footnote 7: We are indebted to Alfredo Ferrari and Paola Sala for useful discussions and for setting up the code.

By subtracting all the above listed contributions from (15) one gets a constant term

\[c=(0.65\pm 0.04)\% \tag{16}\]

A couple of checks have been done to ascertain the consistency of this result.

1. The choice of the fit region is not too critical. If it is extended down to -3\(\sigma\) the resulting constant term would be 0.69%. The latter can be considered an upper limit for the reasons explained in the next section.
2. The overall constant term is expected to be consistent with the quadratic sum of the local residual Accordion modulation and the rms of the cell-to-cell response variation (0.58%). In our case \[(0.3\pm 0.05)\%\oplus(0.58\pm 0.04)\%=(0.65\pm 0.04)\%\] (17) which is compatible with the value in equation (16).

### The low energy tail

The spectrum shown in fig. 22 shows a rather pronounced tail at low energy. This tail was attributed to energy losses of the electron beam before reaching the calorimeter and was probably related to the presence of another experiment (NA45) running in parasitic mode in the same beam line during the period in which the position scan was recorded (Spring '93).

This assumption is demonstrated by fig. 23 which shows the energy spectra for 287 GeV electrons hitting the same calorimeter cell but recorded during two different test beam periods.

It can be seen that the two distributions have a comparable width but the data collected in Autumn '92 (energy scan), with clean beam conditions, exhibit a minimal tail, which has been

previously motivated (section 5.4), while at the time of the uniformity scan (Spring '93) more events populate the left part of the spectrum.

Moreover the energy resolution measured with the Spring '93 data is significantly improved if suitable cuts on the beam chambers and counters are used to get cleaner electrons, while these cuts have essentially no effects on the Autumn '92 data.

### Discussion

The main known instrumental effects contributing to the constant term of the energy resolution are listed in table 3.

#### Contributions from the calibration

The various sources of non-uniformity coming from the calibration and electronic chain have been discussed in section 3. Their contribution to the constant term was evaluated with a simple simulation programme which used the energy deposited in each cell of the nonet by 287 GeV electron showers (obtained from the data) and smeared them with the channel-to-channel rms dispersion for each item.

The uniformity of the calibration pulse at the premplifier input was estimated [5, 22] by comparing the response of a given channel to the two different calibration systems and assuming comparable precisions of the two methods.

Figure 23: Energy spectra reconstructed in the 2m prototype for 287 GeV electrons hitting cell \(\phi=14\), \(\eta\)=16. The two distributions, which are normalized to the same number of events, refer to data taken in Autumn ’92 (black symbols) and in Spring ’93 (open circles, small statistics).

The table also includes the residual rms spread of the channel-to-channel calibrated response (_adc_\(\rightarrow\)GeV conversion); the asynchrony between the physics and the calibration signal and the related uncertainty on the cross-talk correction; the effect of the wrong gains produced by the faulty injection networks.

_Contributions from the mechanics_

The effect of the residual \(\phi\) modulation has been already quoted in section 5.2.2 while the non-uniformity induced by the dispersion in the LAr gap thickness was evaluated by means of a convolution with the shower energy sharing as described above.

Also non-homogeneities in the thickness of the absorber plates spoil the calorimeter resolution. Figure 24 shows the measured lead thickness for the 73 absorber plates belonging to

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline EFFECT & contribution (\%) \\ \hline Calibration & \\ \hline uniformity of calibration pulse & 0.2 \\ _adc_\(\rightarrow\) GeV conversion & 0.15 \\ timing precision & 0.2 \\ residual cross–talk effect & 0.1 \\ cross–talk in the injection networks & 0.1 \\ \hline Mechanics & \\ \hline residual modulation (\(\phi\)) & 0.3 \\ gap uniformity & 0.15 \\ absorber thickness & 0.3 \\ \hline total (\(\oplus\)) & 0.57 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

the stack [23]. These plates were grouped in the three modules of the calorimeter according to their thickness: thinner plates in the bottom module, thicker plates in the middle module and intermediate plates in the top one as visible in the figure. The rms dispersion from plate to plate within a given module is less than 10 \(\mu\)m. However there are a few absorbers significantly away from the average. These local changes in the calorimeter density affect both the absolute response of the detector and the energy sharing between longitudinal samplings as demonstrated by the data.

Figure 25 shows that the energy response significantly diminishes when the amount of lead contained in the hit cell increases (smaller sampling fraction). In particular the thickest plate of the stack, which belongs to row \(\phi\)=15, is responsible for an energy drop of about 0.5%.

From a plot of the longitudinal energy sharing as a function of the electron impact cell in \(\phi\) (fig. 26) it can be seen that the thinner (thicker) plate at \(\phi\)=8(15) in fig. 24 produces a later (earlier) shower development.

The rms of the four points in fig. 25 is 0.3%. This is the expected contribution to the energy resolution.

The quadratic sum of all the contributions listed in table 3 (0.57%) has to be compared with the value given in equation (16). It can be seen that a large part of the constant term can be explained by known effects, but other contributions cannot be excluded. Particularly difficult to be estimated are possible contingent problems such as abnormally slow preamplifiers or faulty calibration cables.

## 7 Conclusions

In this Note we have discussed the performance of the first large scale Accordion prototype for the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter. The results are based on electron data collected over a wide energy range and a large detector area. They can be summarized as follows:

* the sampling term of the energy resolution can be kept at the level of \(10\%\sqrt{E}\) over the rapidity coverage \(\eta\leq 1\) by suitably reducing the absorber density. This result however was obtained with a small amount of passive material in front of the calorimeter.
* the detector uniformity of response measured over 96 cells is 0.58%.
* the overall constant term of the energy resolution is 0.65%. It can be in large part motivated by known instrumental effects, with similar contributions from the calibration and the mechanics.
* these first results, although encouraging, demonstrate that a higher accuracy in the quality of the mechanics (uniformity of the absorber thickness, assembling of the stack) and a better reliability of the calibration system are needed to fulfil the 1% limit on the constant term over the full ATLAS calorimeter.
