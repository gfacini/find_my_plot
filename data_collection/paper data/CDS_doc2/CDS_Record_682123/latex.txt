**ABSTRACT**

It is suggested to look for \(\mbox{\tt h}^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) in gluino and squark

cascade decays. It is argued that with a 50 % b-tagging

efficiency, for some SUSY parameter values, this could

give a new SUSY signal.

**1. Introduction**

The standard way to look for the gluino and squark SUSY-particles is to start with events with large missing transverse energy and then perform some topological cuts. This was for example done in the study to the Aachen conference [1], and the conclusion was that after one year of running at low luminosity (\(10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)), on. should be able to discover a gluino or squark in the expected mass range 300 to 1000 GeV. However, the result depends on having a good understanding of the tail of the missing \(E_{T}\)-distribution, since the signal in this study was an excess of events with large missing \(E_{T}\) over the expected background. Any extra handle that could signal SUSY, or tool that could decrease further the background, would be good to have. One such handle could be b-tagging, which could perhaps be 50 % efficient at low luminosity. There are at least two ways the b-tagging could be used: to search for \(h^{0}\to b\overline{b}\) in the cascade-decay of heavier gluinos and perhaps to further cut down the remaining background. The background is dominated by \(t\bar{t}\)-production, and one would wish that the \(t\):s could be identified via the b-tagging. While the second possibility might be too difficult, the first one should be of interest for some region of the SUSY parameter space. In this note the \(h^{0}\to b\overline{b}\) in the cascade-decay of gluinos will be discussed, taking as starting point the results of Aachen [1]. It will be shown that for some SUSY parameter values, there is a good chance that this decay can give an extra handle for the search of gluinos and squarks, and further could be another way to find the lightest SUSY Higgs \(h^{0}\). No simulations further than those for Aachen have been done yet, so some numbers are only crudely estimated, but the result should be interesting enough to stimulate new simulation studies.

**2. Recapitulation of the Aachen results**

In this section the main lines of the simulation and the analysis for the gluino search made for the Aachen workshop [1] are given to give the starting point for the discussions in section 3. The SUSY-parameters chosen were \(m_{\tilde{s}}\)=300 and 1000 GeV, \(tan\beta\)=2 and 10, \(m_{\tilde{s}}=2m_{\tilde{s}}\), \(m_{H^{\pm}}\)=500 GeV and \(\mu\)=-440 GeV. SUSY-events as well as background were simulated with ISAJET [2]. The backgrounds included were

i) \(W\to e\nu,\mu\nu\) and \(\tau\nu\)

ii) \(Z\to\nu\nu\)

iii) \(t\bar{t}\) production with \(m_{t}\)=150 GeV.

Table 1 [1] summarizes the total signal (gluino pair production) and background event rates expected for \(10^{4}pb^{-1}\), i.e. one year running at luminosity \(10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). Detector effects were crudely simulated by representing a calorimeter with a grid of size \(\Delta\Phi\times\Delta\eta=0.05\times 0.05\), extending out to \(|\eta|=5\), and by introducing reasonable energy resolutions (\(10\%/\sqrt{E(GeV)}\oplus 1\%\) and \(50\%/\sqrt{E(GeV)}\oplus 2\%\) for the EM and hadronic parts, resp.). Jets were only reconstructed within \(|\eta|<3\).

To extract the signal the following three cuts were done (after a primary cut of missing \(E_{T}>100\) GeV):

i) Require at least three jets with \(E_{T}>200\) GeV.

ii) Circularity C (for definition, see [1]) \(>0.2\).

iii) The angle \(\Delta\Phi\) between the two highest \(E_{T}\)-jets less than \(130^{0}\).

The cuts are illustrated in Fig. 1 [1] for the 1000 GeV gluino case and the resulting missing \(E_{T}\) distributions for signal and background are shown in Fig. 2. After making a finalcut in missing \(E_{T}\) at 300 GeV or 400 GeV, the number of gluino events and background events are given in table 2[1]. One notes that the remaining background is dominated by \(t\bar{t}\) and that at least for the 1000 GeV gluino there seems to be a good signal whereas there are large statistical uncertainties in the 300 GeV case. However an excess of events in a tail of a distribution is clearly not a "smoking gun" signature, and it requires a good understanding of the background. It is desirable to find some characteristic in the events as selected above which would more uniquely signal SUSY.

**3. Cascade-decays of gluinos**

If the gluino is heavy it may have many different decay modes, into neutralinos (\(\tilde{\chi}^{0}\)) or charginos (\(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}\)) plus quarks or a gluon. The heavier neutralinos and charginos will in their turn decay into lighter neutralinos or charginos while radiating an intermediate vector boson or a Higgs [3]. Branching ratios are strongly dependent on the SUSY parameters, but in tables 3 and 4[3] are shown the masses for the particles of interest and branching ratios for the values used in the Aachen study [1]. Note that not all possible decay modes for the 1000 GeV gluino were used. Already in [1] a study was done to see whether one could exploit the channel \(\tilde{g}\tilde{g}\to ZZ+X\to 4\) leptons \(+X\) and it was found to be useful for favourable values of the SUSY parameters. Here the possiblility to use the cascades with \(h^{0}\) will be investigated.

The \(h^{0}\) decays to \(b\bar{b}\) with a branching ratio close to 1 in most cases [4] and thus with an efficient b-tagging it would be possible to find a mass-peak of the \(h^{0}\) in an invariant-mass spectrum from b-jets, provided there are enough \(h^{0}\):s compared to the background. The number of \(h^{0}\):s after one year of low-luminosity running is trivial to compute from tables 2 and 4. The same SUSY parameter values as used in the gluino study of [1] is thus used, and one starts with the sample obtained after the cuts leading to table 2. In the \(m_{\tilde{g}}\)=300 GeV case no Higgses are produced, so this case is out. The possible cascade decays and probabilities giving \(h^{0}\) in the \(m_{\tilde{g}}\)=1000, \(tan\beta=10\) case is sketched in Fig. 3. The distribution of the number of \(h^{0}\) in events with gluino-pair production is given in table 5. For \(tan\beta\)=10 the average number of \(h^{0}\) per gluino-event is 0.64. In the \(tan\beta\)=2 case at least 19 % of the gluino-events will give an \(h^{0}\), but as much as 33 % of the gluino-decays are not accounted for, and will perhaps also give some \(h^{0}\). Thus if the lower missing \(E_{T}\) cut (\(>300\) GeV) in table 2 is used, one would naively expect 122 (22) \(h^{0}\) for \(tan\beta\)=10(2) in a total of 221 (145) events, after one year of \(10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) running.

The next question to consider is how many of the \(h^{0}\):s will be found and how many jets not coming from a \(h^{0}\)-decay will be tagged as b-jets. From b-tagging studies in connection with top-studies [5], it seems possible to achieve a 50 % b-tagging efficiency with only a 5 % probability to mistakenly tag a non-b jet. With this efficiency, and assuming \(h^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) with BR=0.99, one would be left with 30 and 5 \(h^{0}\) where both b-jets are found, for \(tan\beta\)=10 and 2, resp. Whereas 5 \(h^{0}\) are clearly too few, 30 may be enough if the background is not large.

In order to make some estimate of the background the following crude consideration is done: First note that there is a lot of energy available in the decays of the gluino to neutralinos (Q=500-600 GeV) as well as in the neutralino-decays (Q=150-300 GeV) and even in the \(h^{0}\) decay there is 80 GeV available. Thus it is likely that the b-jets from the \(h^{0}\) will have large transverse energy, and for simplicity we will assume that only a negligible fraction has less \(E_{T}\) than around 100 GeV. From Fig. 1a one can estimate the average number of jets with \(E_{T}>\)200 GeV. If one assumes that the cuts in C, \(\Delta\Phi\) and missing \(E_{T}\) do not much change the \(N_{jet}\)-distribution, and taking into account the cut at \(N_{jet}\geq 3\), the surviving events should have in average about 3.7 jets per event (with \(E_{T}>200\) GeV). Let us then guess that the average number of jets with \(E_{T}>1^{0}0\) GeV is 6, after all selection cuts. For simplicity we will assume that after one year running we will have (see tables 2 and 5) \(0.53\cdot 190+31=132\) events with six non-b jets and no \(h^{0}\), \(0.33\cdot 190=63\) events with \(1h^{0}\to b\bar{b}+4\) non-b jets, \(0.12\cdot 190=23\) events with \(2h^{0}\to b\bar{b}+2\) non-b jets and \(0.02\cdot 190=4\) events with \(3h^{0}\to b\bar{b}+2\) non-b jets. Taking the 5 % mis-tagging probability assumed above, one then finds a total number of jet-jet combinations of close to 90, out of which 30 are correct \(b\bar{b}\)-pairs coming from the same \(h^{0}\). Half of the 60 background combinations are actually due to wrong \(b\bar{b}\)-combinations from different \(h^{0}\)'s in multi-\(h^{0}\) events, and therefore it does not seems crucial that the mis-tagging probability is as low as 5 %. The conclusion must be that there is a reasonable chance to find an \(h^{0}\) mass peak.

**4. Discussion and suggestions**

There are many uncertainties in the considerations above, but it seems possible that a \(h^{0}\) signal could be found in the cascade decay of gluinos, and probably also squarks, for some SUSY parameter regions. There are however assumptions that have to be checked and many questions that need to be studied. Most of this work will need simulation studies, more or less detailed:

1) It was assumed that the gluino-events that survive the selection cuts have the same fraction of \(h^{0}\)'s as the production sample. This is not obvious, but it could even be that the selected sample is enriched in \(h^{0}\)'s because these events may have more jets due to their cascading.

2) It was assumed that only \(b\)'s from \(h^{0}\)-decays were present. This is obviously not true, for example there are also many Z's and W's in the cascades which will give a sizeable amount of \(b\)'s.

3) A very crude guess on the number of background-jets was done. This is perhaps the most crucial point above and should quickly be checked. How does the background of false jet-jet invariant masses look like?

4) Only one point in the SUSY-space out of four was found that reasonably well could give this new SUSY-signal. How large is the region were it could be useful? Which SUSY-values gives a sufficient amount of \(h^{0}\)'s in the decays of gluinos and/or squarks?

5) The \(h^{0}\)-mass in the positive case above is 89.2 GeV, uncomfortably close to the Z-mass of 91.2 GeV. How does this affect the possibility to settle the SUSY-signal? How well could the \(h^{0}\)-mass be determined? One expects to measure the \(t\)-mass with an error of about 5 GeV, using three jets, so in principle \(h^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) could get a smaller error but it will be limited by statistics.

6) The b-tagging was assumed to be 50 % efficient and only a 5 % mis-tagging probability was assumed, based on studies of b-jets from top-quark decays [5]. Are these numbers reasonable for the, rather special, events that survive the selection cuts?

There now exists a convenient Monte Carlo program for SUSY-studies, ISASUSY by H. Baer, F. Paige, S. Protopescu and X. Tata. It is based on ISAJET but automatically calculates all SUSY-masses and branching ratios given the SUSY parameter values. With this program only, point 4 above could be studied and ISASUSY together with a very simplified calorimeter simulation (e.g. a la Aachen) should be enough to study points 1 and 2. To settle point 3 one need also to make some \(t\bar{t}\)-simulation, e.g. with ISAJET. To fully understand points 5 and 6 one may need to do a full detector simulation. There are also other things that easily can be checked, e.g. the \(E_{T}\)-distribution of \(b\)-jets from \(h^{0}\). What are the optimal \(E_{T}\)-values to cut on?

**5. Conclusion**

A possible new way to discover a SUSY-signal has been suggested. It is based on using b-tagging to find \(h^{0}\to b\bar{b}\) in heavy gluino or squark decays. Starting from the Aachen simulation study [1] and using some crude estimates of background, it was found that at least for some values of the SUSY-parameters a clear signal could emerge. Suggestions for more detailed studies were given. Another, but probably less useful, way to use \(b\)-tagging could be to try to identify the remaing \(t\bar{t}\)-background after the topological selection cuts in the sample of events with large missing \(E_{T}\).
