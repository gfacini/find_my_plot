Introduction

The identification of jets containing \(b\)-hadrons, called \(b\)-tagging, is an important ingredient of many physics analyses with the ATLAS detector [1]. Possible applications range from high precision measurements in the top quark sector to searches for new phenomena, where \(b\)-tagging algorithms are used to suppress background processes containing mainly light flavour jets.

The heavy flavour tagging algorithms used in ATLAS are either based on the presence of soft leptons (electrons or muons) as decay products of \(c\)- and \(b\)-hadrons or on the hadrons relatively long lifetime \(\tau\), which is of the order of 1.5 ps for hadrons containing a \(b\)-quark. \(b\)-hadrons that have a transverse momentum of 70 GeV will have therefore an average decay length \(\langle L_{xy}\rangle=\beta\gamma c\tau\) of 6.4 mm in the transverse plane before they decay. Such a decay gives rise to a secondary vertex (see Figure 1). The impact parameter, which is the distance of closest approach between an extrapolated track and the primary vertex, tends to be relatively large for tracks stemming from a displaced vertex, while tracks coming from the primary vertex have impact parameters compatible with zero once the tracking resolution has been accounted for.

The ATLAS lifetime based \(b\)-tagging algorithms are subdivided in two categories. The impact parameter based \(b\)-tagging algorithms such as IP2D or IP3D [2] use the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter significances \(d_{0}/\sigma_{d_{0}}\) and \(z_{0}/\sigma_{z_{0}}\) of all tracks associated to a jet, while the vertex based \(b\)-tagging algorithm such as SV0, SV1 or JetFitter [3, 4] utilize the properties of reconstructed secondary vertices to distinguish between \(b\)- and light flavour jets. The vertex based \(b\)-tagging algorithms have a much higher separation power than the impact parameter ones, but their ability to identify \(b\)-jets is limited by the secondary vertex finding efficiency. More sophisticated \(b\)-tagging algorithms such as JetFitterCombNN [4] or MV1 [5] use multivariate techniques such as artifical neural networks (ANN) to combine information from the track impact parameters and the secondary vertex to achieve an even higher separation power by also taking the correlations of the various input quantities into account.

Figure 1: Schematic view of a \(b\)-hadron decay inside a jet resulting in a secondary vertex with three charged particle tracks. The vertex is significantly displaced with respect to the primary vertex, thus the decay length is macroscopic and well measurable. The track impact parameter, which is the distance of closest approach between the extrapolation of the track and the primary vertex, is shown in addition for one of the secondary tracks.

Due to its large mass the top quark plays an important role in many new physics scenarios. Favoured benchmark models in the search for heavy resonances that might decay into highly boosted top-antitop quark pairs are topcolour-assisted technicolour [6] or Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped extra-dimensions [7], which predict particles such as a leptophobic \(Z^{\prime}\), a bulk Kaluza-Klein (KK) gluon or a bulk Randall-Sundrum spin-2 graviton. Supersymmetric extensions of the Standard Model (SM) [8, 9] or scenarios including further Higgs bosons [10] could also lead to high \(p_{\rm T}\) top quarks. Investigations in the various ATLAS analysis groups cover a broad spectrum of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics and provide exclusion limits on some of these models that extend already to \(\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) mass scales. With the increased center-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}\) in the second run of the LHC, new regions of phase space will become available and thus the sensitivity of the ongoing searches for new physics will be significantly enlarged.

The decay products of a boosted top quark (or any other highly boosted particle) can be strongly collimated and their signatures in the calorimeter system might even have a significant overlap (as schematically shown in Figure 2). While the merging between an electron or a muon and a jet can still be resolved by applying dedicated isolation requirements and correction techniques, the overlap of two or more jets can lead to the problem that the reconstructed jets do not resemble sufficiently the initial particles. The identification of \(b\)-hadrons inside such dense environments is still of great interest as it is needed to distinguish top quark induced jets from high-\(p_{\rm T}\) QCD jets.

This note therefore describes the performance of the common ATLAS \(b\)-tagging algorithms in the context of dense environments as they can be found in the decay of boosted top quarks into jets. A new multivariate analysis (MVA) based \(b\)-tagging algorithm called MVb is also presented. The training of this new \(b\)-tagger is modified with respect to that of the current tools to take the conditions of boosted topologies better into account.

## 2 Simulation samples

The studies described below are mainly based on the use of simulated \(t\bar{t}\) or dijet events but also on certain BSM processes. All events are generated at a centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}\) of 8 \(\,\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) and passed afterwards through the full ATLAS detector simulation [11, 12]. The simulated events are overlaid with additional inelastic \(pp\) interactions in order to match the pile-up conditions observed in the ATLAS data recorded during the 2012 run of the LHC.

The production of \(t\bar{t}\) events (according to the SM predictions) is simulated by the POWHEG [13] generator at a next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy of the matrix element using the CT10 parton distribution function (PDF) sets [14]. Parton showering and underlying events are modeled by PYTHIA v6.4.26 [15]

Figure 2: Schematic view of the decays of a boosted top and antitop quark into a final state containing leptons and jets. The decay products on both the leptonic and hadronic side of the event are strongly collimated and their signatures might overlap in the calorimeter system. As the standard narrow-cone jet algorithms might fail to resolve the hadronic side of the event, the \(t\to bW\to bqq\) decay is reconstructed as one single large-radius jet in order to recover sensitivity.

with the Perugia 2011C tune. [16]. In addition various BSM Monte Carlo samples are used. The process \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\)[17] is simulated using the default settings of PYTHIA v8.165 [18] for both the matrix element and parton shower generation. The PDF set MSTW2008LO [19] is used to produce samples for various \(Z^{\prime}\) masses ranging from 0.4 TeV to 3 TeV, in which the assumed \(Z^{\prime}\) width is of the order of 3% of its mass and therefore small compared to the detector resolution. A further BSM process corresponds to a hypothetical decay of a Kaluza-Klein-gluon into a \(t\bar{t}\) pair [20]. This process is simulated using the MadGraph5 v1.3.33 generator [21] interfaced to PYTHIA8 and the MSTW2008LO PDF set. Dijet events are generated by PYTHIA8 using the AU2 tune and the CT10 PDF set. These samples were generated with the same number of events for each of several disjoint phase space regions, where the transverse momentum of the leading jet is the classification criteria. In total seven different dijet samples are used with bin edges of 20 GeV, 80 GeV,200 GeV, 500 GeV,1000 GeV, 1500 GeV, 2000 GeV and \(\infty\).

## 3 Jet, track and vertex reconstruction

Jets are reconstructed by applying the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm as implemented in the FASTJet package [22] to topological clusters of adjoining calorimeter cells with energy deposits, using a distance parameters of \(R=0.4\). The topological clusters are calibrated by using the so-called local cluster weighting method [23] in order to compensate for differencies in the calorimeter response to hadronic and electromagnetic showers. In addition the final jet properties (such as the mass, the transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), or the pseudorapidity, \(\eta^{1}\)) are corrected with energy and \(\eta\) dependent simulation-based scaling factors [23, 24] to compensate for the effects of pile-up, out-of-cluster leakage and dead material.

The jets used in this study are required to have a transverse momentum of at least 25 GeV and an absolute pseudorapidity below 2.5. Jets stemming from a pile-up vertex are rejected by using the so-called jet-vertex fraction (JVF) [25]. This quantity is calculated as the ratio of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) sum of the tracks associated with both the jet and the selected primary vertex to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) sum of all tracks associated with the jet. Within this study jets that have a \(|\mathrm{JVF}|<0.5\) are removed if their transverse momentum is below 50 GeV and their absolute pseudorapidity is below 2.4.

Primary vertex candidates are reconstructed by applying an iterative vertex finding algorithm [26] to tracks that are compatible with originating from the interaction region [27], where all tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>400\) MeV are considered. The primary vertex candidates are required to be made up of at least five reconstructed tracks. If more than one candidate exists, the one with the highest \(p_{T}^{2}\) sum of the assccociated tracks is used.

### Tracks and vertices

Charged particle tracks reconstructed in the Inner Detector are the key ingredient for the various \(b\)-tagging algorithms used in ATLAS analyses. The impact parameter and its sign are both important properties of a track as they can be used to distinguish between tracks originating from the primary vertex or from displaced vertices. The signs of the track impact parameters are determined using the jet direction as an approximation of the \(b\)-hadron flight direction and the track direction evaluated at the primary vertex. They are positive if the angle between the direction of the jet axis and the line joining the primary vertex to the point of closest approach of the studied track is less than 90\({}^{\circ}\) and negative otherwise. While tracks stemming from the decay of a \(c\)- or \(b\)-hadron tend to be signed positively, tracks not coming from a displaced vertex are expected to be distributed approximately symmetric around zero [5].

Both the secondary vertex and the impact parameter based algorithms are applied only to the sub-set of tracks that are assigned to any of the jets contained in a selected event. The association between tracks and their jets is accomplished by a spatial \(\Delta R(\mathrm{track,jet})\)-matching procedure [4], where the allowed distance between the two objects is dependent on the transverse momentum of the jet:

\[\Delta R\left(p_{\mathrm{T}}\right)=0.239+e^{-\left(1.22+0.0164\cdot p_{ \mathrm{T}}/\ \mathrm{GeV}\right)}. \tag{1}\]

This procedure leads to smaller cones for high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets which are more collimated and is meant to reduce the number of associated tracks stemming from the fragmentation, the underlying event or pile-up vertices, in order to increase the separation power of the \(b\)-tagging discriminants. While jets with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 25 GeV get all tracks associated that are within a cone of \(\Delta R=0.43\) around their axis, the corresponding cone for jets with a transverse momentum of 200 GeV has a radius of 0.25. In the case where two or more jets are very close to each other tracks are always matched to the nearest jet in order to avoid double-counting.

Tracks that are associated with a jet have to fulfil certain quality requirements in order to be considered in any of the \(b\)-tagging algorithms. The aim is to keep the well-measured tracks, while rejecting those coming from material interactions with the silicon layers of the Inner Detector or from the decay of long-living light-flavour particles like \(K_{S}^{0}\), \(\Lambda^{0}\) or other hyperons. Details on the track selection requirements for both the secondary vertex and impact parameter based taggers can be found in [4].

#### 3.1.1 Vertex reconstruction

Secondary vertices inside jets can be reconstructed either by an iterative vertex finder (used for the SV0 and SV1 taggers) or by the JetFitter algorithm (used for JetFitterCombNN). The iterative vertex finder reconstructs inclusive vertices containing the decay products of a \(b\)-hadron and possibly also that of the subsequent \(c\)-hadron [3] based on a \(\chi^{2}\) minimisation. The JetFitter algorithm [4, 28] exploits the topology of the decay cascade introduced by a \(b\)-hadron decay to reconstruct separately the secondary and tertiary vertices. A multi-vertex fit is performed on the assumption that the primary event vertex and the vertices of the weak \(b\)- and \(c\)-hadron decays lie on a common line defined through the flight direction of the \(b\)-hadron. The technical implementation of this procedure is based on a Kalman filter and its main advantage with respect to the iterative vertex finder is the feasibility of reconstructing vertices from single tracks intersecting the flight axis.

Most properties of a secondary vertex resulting from the decay of a \(b\)-hadron are significantly different compared to those stemming from light-flavour decays. The relatively high \(b\)-hadron mass (about 5 GeV) and its long lifetime are particularly important. Observables that are used in the various ATLAS \(b\)-tagging algorithms to identify \(b\)-hadrons inside highly-energetic particle jets are listed in Table 1.

#### 3.1.2 Truth labelling

The truth flavour labeling in simulation is currently based on an angular matching of generator level particles to reconstructed jets using their coordinates in the \(\eta\phi\)-plane. If a \(b\)-quark with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>5\) GeV is found to be within a cone of the radius \(\Delta R=0.3\) around the axis of a jet, this jet is labeled as a \(b\)-jet. This matching procedure is repeated sequentially for \(c\)-quarks and \(\tau\)-leptons, if no association to a \(b\)-quark is possible. A jet is labeled by default as light-flavoured, if no association to one of these particles was successful.

The performance of a \(b\)-tagging algorithm is quantified by the \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}\) and the rejection rates for \(\tau\)-, \(c\)- and light-flavour jets. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency is defined as the fraction of \(b\)-hadron jets that are tagged by the \(b\)-tagging algorithm, while the rejection rate of a certain jet flavour \(i\) is simply the inverse of the corresponding mistagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{i}\) (fraction of \(\tau\)-, \(c\)- or light-flavour jets tagged mistakenly as a \(b\)-jet).

## 4 b-tagging in boosted \(t\overline{t}\) decays

The identification of isolated \(b\)-jets was intensively studied in the data recorded by the ATLAS detector during the LHC runs in 2011 and 2012. Its performance is well understood for jets with a transverse momentum between 20 and 300. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency for jets with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) around 100 can be measured with a total systematic uncertainty below 2% [29]. But as the excluded mass regions in searches for new physics increase gradually to higher values, the corresponding analyses will focus on event topologies containing highly boosted massive particles such as top quarks, \(W\), \(Z\) or Higgs bosons. Since top quarks and Higgs bosons predominantly decay into final states including \(b\)-quarks the importance of understanding the performance of the ATLAS \(b\)-tagging algorithms applied to dense environments will increase.

A crucial feature of highly boosted massive particles are their strongly collimated decay products. The

\end{table}
Table 1: Various properties (and their definitions) of the vertex candidates reconstructed either by the iterative vertex finder or the JetFitter algorithm. The quantity \(N^{\mathrm{trk}}_{\mathrm{SV}}\) is equal to zero if the decay topology is only described by single-track vertices (its definition is therefore by construction slightly different for vertices reconstructed with the iterative vertex finder and the JetFitter algorithm). Decay topologies reconstructed by the JetFitter algorithm are further described by the overall number of single- and multi-track vertex candidates associated to the fit. The azimuth and polar angle of the vertex candidates are measured with respect to the detector coordinate system. The decay length significance of a secondary vertex candidate is signed with respect to the jet axis direction analogously to the impact parameter. Both the iterative vertex finder (with the SV1 setup) and the JetFitter algorithm reject vertices that have a negative decay length significance.

angular separation \(\Delta R\) in the \(\eta\phi\)-plane between the decay products of a particle with the mass \(m\) and the transverse momentum \(p_{\rm T}\) can be approximated in case of a 2-body decay by

\[\Delta R\approx\frac{2m}{p_{\rm T}}. \tag{2}\]

Hence the decay products of a top quark with a transverse momentum of \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm top}=350\) GeV tend to have an angular separation of \(\Delta R<1.0\)[24]. As the top quark \(p_{\rm T}\) increases to even higher values the expected angular separation will decrease further until at some point the collimation becomes so strong that the standard reconstruction techniques are no longer capable of resolving the decay products individually. This leads for example to the problem that jets clustered with a distance parameter of \(R=0.4\) might not sufficiently resemble the partons from the decay \(t\to bW\to bq\bar{q}\), as the corresponding particle shower of more than one parton could be combined into one jet. Figure 3 visualizes the \(p_{\rm T}\) dependence of the angular separation \(\Delta R\) between the \(W\)-boson and the \(b\)-quark in simulated top quark decays, as well as the \(p_{\rm T}\) dependence of the minimal separation between the \(b\)-quark and the two resulting partons stemming from the \(W\to q\bar{q}\) decay.

The identification of \(b\)-hadrons inside the dense environment of such a boosted hadronic top quark decay or also in a boosted \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay is much more demanding compared to its applications in resolved topologies as tracks can easily be assigned to the wrong source if the decay products are close to each other. A further shortcoming under these conditions is the degradation of the resolution of the \(b\)-hadron direction which is approximated by the axis of the corresponding reconstructed jet in certain steps of the calculation of any \(b\)-tagging related quantity. As additional activity next to a jet can change the axis direction considerably, this approximation might no longer be valid. Therefore it is important to investigate the performance of the various ATLAS \(b\)-tagging algorithms and their input quantities for \(b\)-jets that overlap partially or are merged completely with a particle shower induced by the partons resulting from the \(W\to q\bar{q}\) decay. A simple approach to study the \(b\)-tagging performance in hadronic top quark decays is to calculate for each reconstructed \(b\)-jet the minimal distance to the quarks (at generator level) that originate from the \(W\to q\bar{q}\) decay

\[\Delta R^{\rm min}=\min\{\Delta R(b{-}{\rm jet},q),\Delta R(b{-}{\rm jet}, \bar{q})\} \tag{3}\]

and probe the \(b\)-tagging efficiency of the different taggers as a function of this quantity. This approach is of course only applicable in the simulation, whereas reconstructable variables are essential to understand the performance in data. However, this quantity allows the identification of those variables used in the various \(b\)-tagging algorithms that are sensitive to a jet overlap. Hence \(b\)-jets are classified according to their distance to the nearest \(W\) decay product, so that jets are considered as merged if their \(\Delta R^{\rm min}\) is smaller than the size of the radius parameter used in the jet clustering procedure. Figure 4 shows the \(b\)-tagging efficiency of the current ATLAS default tagger, MV1, as a function of this quantity separately for three different jet \(p_{\rm T}\) regions. The chosen operating point corresponds to an overall \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 70% for \(b\)-jets selected from the simulated SM \(t\bar{t}\) sample according to the object definition criteria described in Section 3. It can be seen that the tagging performance is degraded noticeably if the distance between a \(b\)-jet and the \(W\) boson decay products decreases. The total loss of efficiency due to a partial overlapping or even a complete merging of the \(b\)-jet with a decay product of the \(W\) boson seems to be only slightly dependent on the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) and an overall loss by a factor of 1.7 can be observed from the highest to the lowest considered \(\Delta R^{\rm min}\) values.

The same comparisons for the JetFitterCombNN, the IP3D and the SV0 taggers reveal that the degradation effect occurs regardless of whether the studied \(b\)-tagger is based on the track impact parameters, the secondary vertex properties or a neural network combining both.

### Problems related to the identification of \(b\)-jets inside dense environments

#### 4.1.1 Shift of the jet axis

One of the major problems connected to \(b\)-tagging in dense environments is the resolution of the \(b\)-jet direction. Additional activity in the calorimeter clusters next to those stemming from a \(b\)-jet can skew the

Figure 4: The \(b\)-tagging efficiencies’ dependence on the \(\Delta R^{\rm min}\) between the \(b\)-quark jets and the hadronic decay products of the \(W\)-boson stemming from top quark decays for the MV1 algorithm. The chosen working point corresponds to an overall \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 70%. Jets are classified into three different \(p_{\rm T}\) regions and studied separately.

Figure 3: Angular distance \(\Delta R\) between the \(W\)-bosons and \(b\)-quarks in \(t\to bW\) decays as a function of the transverse momentum of the top quark (a), and smallest distance \(\Delta R^{\rm min}\) in the \(\eta\phi\)-plane between the \(b\)-quark and the decay products of the \(W\)-boson in \(t\to bW\to bq\bar{q}\) decays (b) as a function of the top quark \(p_{\rm T}\). The distributions are normalised column-wise in the \(p_{\rm T}\) bins and the color coding corresponds to the fraction of considered top quarks. Both distributions correspond to the particle information at the generator level after the emission of inital and final state radiation and are obtained from \(t\bar{t}\) decays simulated using POWHEG+PYTHIA.

jet axis away from the flight direction of the \(b\)-hadron, if the non-\(b\)-hadron component next to the jet has enough energy. When the distance in the \(\eta\phi\)-plane between the \(b\)-jet axis and the \(b\)-hadron flight direction becomes too large, tracks from the \(b\)-hadron decay might no longer be matched to the jet and therefore not be taken into account in the calculation of the several \(b\)-tagging discriminants. As a consequence the performance of these \(b\)-tagging algorithms degrades considerably. In cases where the track-to-jet association loses several tracks stemming from the \(b\)-hadron decay, even the vertex fit might fail.

The loss of tracks in the track-to-jet association procedure is not the only reason for a decrease of the vertex finding efficiencies of the JetFitter algorithm and the iterative vertex finder (with the SV1 setup). The shift of the jet axis can also have an influence on the sign of the decay length of a secondary vertex, which might be flipped from positive to negative (or vice versa). Such a flip of the decay length sign is directly connected to a degradation of the vertex finding efficiency as both tools reject secondary vertex candidates having a negative decay length. About 90% (70%) of all jets that are perfectly aligned to the \(b\)-hadron flight direction have a secondary vertex reconstructed with the JetFitter algorithm (iterative vertex finder based on the SV1 setup). The efficiencies decrease to approximately 50% and 35% respectively for jets with a \(\Delta R>0.25\) to the nearest \(b\)-hadron. The loss of the vertex finding efficiency in jets having a large angular separation to the \(b\)-hadron flight direction \(\Delta R(b-\mathrm{hadron,jet})>0.18\) is more pronounced for high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(b\)-jets as their \(\Delta R\)-cone used in the track-to-jet association procedure is smaller.

The reduction of the vertex finding efficiency for large values of the angular separation between the \(b\)-hadron and the jet axis is the main reason for a decrease of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency, but other effects can also appear. As the number of tracks assigned to a secondary vertex decreases with increasing \(\Delta R(b-\mathrm{hadron,jet})\) values, other vertex properties like the invariant mass or the energy fraction are also very dependent on how well the jet axis is aligned to the \(b\)-hadron direction. The vertex properties become therefore more and more dissimilar to the reference distribution used in the training of a MVA-based \(b\)-tagger, if the number of missing tracks at the vertex increases.

Similarly to the sign of the decay length, the sign of the track impact parameter is calculated with respect to the jet axis as an approximation of the \(b\)-hadron flight direction and therefore depends strongly on the resolution of the jet direction. With increasing values of the angular separation between the jet and the \(b\)-hadron the fraction of tracks for which the impact parameter sign is flipped from positive to negative increases substantially. Thus the impact parameter based taggers (IP3D or IP2D), which use the signed transverse and longitudinal track impact parameter significance as an input, are also strongly affected by the jet axis shift. However, the dependence that the shift of the jet axis direction has on the IP3D and IP2D taggers is reduced, as the sign of the track impact parameters is calculated with respect to the line connecting the secondary and primary vertex instead of the jet axis direction if the studied jet has a reconstructed secondary vertex. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency as a function of the jet axis shift \(\Delta R(b-\mathrm{hadron,jet})\) is shown in Figure 5 for the current ATLAS default \(b\)-tagger at an operation point corresponding to an overall efficiency of 70%. For jets with a transverse momentum between 75 and 200 \(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) a total loss by a factor of 7 is observed as their \(b\)-tagging efficiency decreases from 80% for jets that are perfectly aligned to the \(b\)-hadron flight direction to 12% for jets that have a \(\Delta R\) larger than 0.25. Jets with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) below 75 \(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) show a total efficiency loss by a factor of 4 over the full range of \(\Delta R\) values, while the \(b\)-tagging efficiency of the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets decreases from 80% to 5%, which corresponds to a reduction by a factor of 16. Similar to the loss of vertex finding efficiency, the \(b\)-tagging efficiency degradation is more pronounced for high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets due to the smaller radius used in the association for tracks.

#### 4.1.2 Light-flavour contamination

Even if the jet axis is not shifted substantially away from the flight direction of the \(b\)-hadron, additional activity close-by a \(b\)-jet can still lead to a contamination with tracks from light-flavour decays. Several of the \(b\)-jet properties are sensitive to such a contamination. As most \(b\)-tagging algorithms are based on pre-defined reference distributions corresponding to several jet properties, the performance of these \(b\)-taggers will degrade with an increasing contamination of tracks from light-flavour decays.

The most crucial differences between tracks resulting from heavy and light-flavour decays appear in the distributions of their transverse and longitudinal impact parameter significance. As the jet weights of the IP2D and IP3D taggers are calculated using the impact parameter significance of all tracks associated to a particular jet, both are good examples of quantities that are strongly influenced by a contamination with light-flavour tracks. In order to quantify the effect that an increasing contamination has on the performance of any \(b\)-tagging algorithm, the track purity is defined for a \(b\)-jet as the number of tracks associated to the \(b\)-hadron decay divided by the total number of tracks assigned to the jet. A low track purity is strongly correlated with a high contamination with tracks from light-flavour quarks or gluon fragmentation and vice versa. Figure 6 (a) and (b) show the \(b\)-tagging efficiencies of the IP3D and MV1 algorithms as a function of this quantity for three different jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) regions and an operation point corresponding to an overall efficiency of 70%. It can be seen that the \(b\)-tagging efficiencies for both taggers decrease considerably if the track purity declines to smaller values. In the displayed range of track purity values the efficiency is decreased by a factor of 2.6-2.8 for the IP3D tagger (with the exact value depending on the transverse momentum of the jet) and by a factor of 1.7-2.1 for the MV1 algorithm. As the IP3D tagger is based only on information concerning the track impact parameters its performance is more affected than that of the MV1 tagger. However, the MV1 algorithm uses the IP3D jet weight as an input to its neural network. Thus the strong dependence on additional tracks from light-flavour decays is propagated to it.

### Influence on the \(b\)-tagging related quantities

After discussing the impact that a jet axis shift or a contamination with tracks from light-flavour decays has on the performance of the current ATLAS \(b\)-tagging algorithms, the various input quantities of the MVA based taggers are individually studied. The aim is to identify those quantities that are affected the most if a \(b\)-jet contains also hadrons coming from the \(W\) boson decay. In addition, further quantities are presented (in Section 4.3) that are not yet used in any of the current high performance algorithms, but promise to be beneficial for the identification of \(b\)-jets in boosted topologies. For this purpose the various \(b\)-tagging related properties of single and merged \(b\)-jets are compared to each other. Here the previous definition of a merged jet (those containing two \(\Delta R\)-matched quarks from the \(t\to bW\to bq\bar{q}\) decay) is

Figure 5: The \(b\)-tagging efficiency of the MV1 tagger as a function of the angular separation between the jet axis and the \(b\)-hadron.

used.

Most of the \(b\)-tagging related quantities are strongly dependent on the jet kinematics. As the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra for single and merged \(b\)-jets are different, a re-weighting has to be applied in order to make their properties comparable. After this procedure the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution (at the reconstruction level) of both jet types are identical in shape. Since light-flavour jets are included in the following comparisons the same re-weighting technique is applied to them as well. Examples of quantities that are strongly influenced by a jet overlap are the jet weight of the IP3D tagger, the energy fraction or the angular separation between the line joining the primary and the secondary vertex and the jet axis \(\Delta R(\mathrm{vertex},\mathrm{jet})\), while quantities like the invariant mass of all tracks at the secondary vertex, the number of two-track vertices or the decay length significance are more stable. However, the impact on the energy fraction is related to a change in the jet properties, rather than to a change in the vertex properties, as additional tracks from light-flavour decays are intrinsically rejected by the vertex fit. Distributions corresponding to these quantities are shown in Figures 7 (a) to (f).

### Alternative quantities

The previously discussed quantities are already used by several of the ATLAS \(b\)-tagging algorithms. Additional variables can provide new information that might help to distinguish between light- and heavy-flavour jets. Quantities that describe the shape of a jet are good candidates as the fragmentation of \(b\)- and light-flavour quarks is very different due to their large mass difference [30]. An example for such a shape-related quantity is the so-called jet width \(w_{\mathrm{jet}}\), which is defined as the \(p_{T}\) weighted average distance \(\Delta R\) between the tracks associated to the jet and its axis direction:

\[w_{\mathrm{jet}}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{T}^{\mathrm{trk}_{i}}\Delta R( \mathrm{trk}_{i},\mathrm{jet})}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}p_{T}^{\mathrm{trk}_{i}}}\;. \tag{4}\]

Its distribution is shown in Figure 8 (a). For jets that do not have any tracks associated, the width is set to 0. As the IP2D and IP3D weights for \(b\)-hadron jets are strongly affected by an increase of the additional

Figure 6: \(b\)-tagging efficiencies of the IP3D (a) and MV1 (b) algorithms as a function of the track purity of the studied jets. The results are shown separately for three different jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges and correspond to an operation point that has an overall efficiency of 70%. To ensure that a low track purity is related to a contamination with tracks from light-flavour decays, rather than to the missing of tracks from the \(b\)-hadron decay, only those jets that contain at least three tracks associated to the decay products of the \(b\)-hadron are considered.

tracks stemming from light-flavour quarks or gluon fragmentation, it is beneficial to use mainly tracks that have a relative large and positively signed impact parameter significance. A simple approach to obtain one single variable from these tracks is given by the so-called TrackCounting algorithm, which was one of the first \(b\)-tagging algorithms designed for the early LHC data recorded by the ATLAS detector. The algorithm uses all tracks that pass certain quality requirements and arranges them in decreasing order of their signed transverse impact parameter significance. Possible discriminants are defined by the \(d_{0}\) significance of the track at each position of that sequence, but previous studies suggested the use of the information of the second or third highest ranked track [2]. As tracks stemming from light-flavour decays tend to have low \(d_{0}\) significances, tracks from additional hadronic activity nearby a \(b\)-jet will be likely to be ranked at a lower position than the tracks of the \(b\)-hadron decay products. The resilience to the addition of extra tracks outweighs the degradation due to the shift of the jet axis at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). Thus the output of the TrackCounting algorithm is much less affected for \(b\)-jets containing also hadrons coming from the \(W\) decay than the IP2D and IP3D jet weights.

Another quantity investigated in this context is the multiplicity of tracks with a large transverse impact parameter significance \(|d_{0}/\sigma_{d_{0}}|>1.8\). Its distribution for single \(b\)-, merged \(b\)- and light-flavour jets is

Figure 7: Distributions of the IP3D jet weight (a), the energy fraction (b), the number of two-track vertices (c), the \(\Delta R(\mathrm{vertex,jet})\) (d), the decay length significance (e) and the invariant mass of the secondary vertex (f) are presented for the inclusive \(b\)- (yellow), merged \(b\)- (black) and light-flavour jets (red). Each distribution is individually normalised to unit area. The considered jets stem from simulated \(t\bar{t}\) decays that are generated with \(\sqrt{s}=8\) and have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\).

presented in Figure 8 (b) next to that of the \(d_{0}\) (c) and the \(z_{0}\) (d) significance of the track with the third highest-ranking. These four quantities are calculated using all tracks that are associated to the studied jets by the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) dependent \(\Delta R\) matching procedure defined in Section 3.1. The corresponding track selection is similar to that of the IP2D and IP3D taggers.

The energy fraction is one of the quantities affected most by a jet overlap, but simultaneously it also provides a high separation between heavy and light-flavour jets. By scaling its values with the ratio of the track multiplicity matched to the jet to the number of tracks associated to the vertex fit, a better stability with respect to a contamination with additional tracks is obtained. The corresponding quantity is shown in Figure 8 (e) and (f) for vertex candidates reconstructed with the iterative vertex finder (using the SV1 setup) or the JetFitter algorithm.

## 5 A new algorithm dedicated to identifying \(b\)-jets in boosted topologies

The performance of the \(b\)-tagging algorithms that are currently used in the various ATLAS analyses strongly degrades in dense environments. Therefore a new \(b\)-tagging algorithm is developed that is in

Figure 8: Distribution of the jet width (a), the number of tracks having a \(d_{0}\) significance above 1.8 (b), the \(d_{0}\) (c) and the \(z_{0}\) (d) significance of the track with the third-highest ranking of its signed \(d_{0}\) significance, as well as the scaled energy fraction corresponding to vertices reconstructed with the iterative vertex finder (using the SV1 setup) (e) or the JetFitter algorithm (f) presented for inclusive \(b\)-, merged \(b\)- and light flavour jets stemming from \(t\bar{t}\) events that are generated at \(\sqrt{s}=8\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). Only jets that have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered. Each distribution is individually normalised to unit area.

tended to be less sensitive to the effects described in the Sections 4.1.1 and 4.1.2. In contrast to the MV1 or JetFitterCombNN algorithms the training procedure (including the handling of the jet kinematics) of this algorithm emphasizes more strongly the high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and dense environment regimes. The previously discussed quantities are used as inputs for the new tagger, with the quantities introduced in Section 4.3 providing an improved stability to the performance of the \(b\)-jet identification in boosted topologies. In addition to these quantities further variables are used in the training. From the vertices that are reconstructed with the iterative vertex finder (with the SV1 setup) the number of two-track vertices, the energy fraction and the transverse decay length are included, while from the vertices reconstructed with the JetFitter algorithm the vertex imbalance, the track multiplicity at the secondary vertex, the \(\log_{10}(\chi^{2}/{\rm ndof})\), the invariant mass, the decay length significance and both the uncertainties of the measured azimuth and polar angles are added. With the jet weight of the IP2D tagger a further IP based quantity is used.

Boosted decision trees are trained using \(b\)-jets as signal and light-flavour jets as background. However, as for some event signatures the dominant background processes mainly contain \(c\)-jets, the procedure is repeated training \(b\)- against \(c\)-jets. The boosted decision trees resulting from these training cycles are referred to as the MVb and MVbCharm algorithms in the following.

### Training and testing of the BDT

The training of the boosted decision trees, on which the MVb tagger relies, is performed by using the BDT implementation of the TMVA package [31]. In the chosen setup the AdaBoost algorithm is used with the parameter \(\beta\) set to 0.5 for boosting a total of 1000 trees. Each of these trees has a maximum depth of five nodes. In order to protect against overtraining the minimum number of events at these leaf nodes is not allowed to be less than 1% of the overall number of events in the training sample. The input data set is randomly split into a training and a testing sample, which are compared to check for overtraining. The two samples contain \(b\)-jets as signal and either \(c\)- or light-flavour jets as background. These jet flavour types are taken from a mixture of simulated \(t\bar{t}\), dijet and \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) events. As both the MVb and MVbCharm taggers are meant to be dedicated to the identification of \(b\)-jets in dense environments, only those events from the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) samples are taken into account that have an invariant \(t\bar{t}\) mass above 0.7 (calculated at the generator level) to emphasize the changed properties of overlapping jets during the training of the boosted decision trees. The obtained jets are additionally required to have a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) between 25 and 800. In order to enrich the statistics in the high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) region, jets stemming from dijet events are also included in the training if their transverse momentum is between 100 and 800.

Since most \(b\)-tagging related quantities depend strongly on the kinematic properties of the jets, additional information and therefore additional separation power is obtained by taking the correlation of the BDT input quantities to the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(|\eta|\) into account. However, only the correlation of the jet \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) to the input quantities should be used to distinguish between \(b\)-, \(c\)- and light-flavour jets and not the shape of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) distribution itself. Otherwise an unwanted dependence on the event topology could be introduced to the training results. One approach to deal with the correlations to the jet kinematics is to subdivide the phase space into several disjoint regions and train independently in each of them. Following this approach five \(|\eta|\) regions with bin boundaries at (0.0, 0.4, 0.8, 1.2, 1.8, 2.5) are defined such that they follow the geometry of the inner detector with three bins corresponding to the barrel region (\(|\eta|\leq 1.2\)) and one for each the overlap (\(1.2<|\eta|\leq 1.8\)) and the end-cap regions (\(|\eta|\geq 1.8\)). Hence five separate boosted decision trees are trained for the MVb and MVbCharm algorithm. As the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) has a much stronger correlation to the properties of the secondary vertex or the impact parameter based quantities it is included as an additional input quantity into the training of the BDT. To avoid an artifical training on the shape of the transverse momentum distribution for different jet flavours the \(c\)- and light-flavour jet samples are re-weighted in such a way that their \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions are identical in normalisation and shape to that of the \(b\)-jets.

A final set of 23 input quantities is considered during the training of the MVb and MVbCharm tagger. In particular, the number of two-track vertices calculated by the iterative vertex finder (SV1), the jet weight of the IP3D algorithm, the transverse decay length, the energy fraction, the width and the transverse momentum of the jets are ranked relatively high in each of the five different \(|\eta|\) regions.

### Expected Performance of the MVb and MVbCharm taggers

The discriminants of the MVb and MVbCharm \(b\)-tagging algorithms are calculated as the object classifier of the underlying boosted decision trees. Their distribution for all selected \(b\)-, \(c\)- and light-flavour jets are displayed in figure 9 (a) and (b) respectively. Both tagging weights show a good separation between \(b\)- and light-flavour jets. However, as the MVbCharm tagger is trained with \(b\)-jets against \(c\)-jets its rejection power with respect to light-flavour jets is less strong, while its ability to reject charm jets is considerably improved compared to MVb.

The shape of the MVb weight distribution for \(b\)-jets reveals some very distinct features, as it has four local maxima. Each of these peaks corresponds to an accumulation of jets having similar properties in the quantities relevant to \(b\)-tagging. In general jets having no vertex found with either the JetFitter algorithm or the iterative vertex finder are most likely considered to be background-like, whereas jets having a reconstructed multi-track vertex tend to be classified as signal depending on the vertex properties (e.g. track multiplicity or energy fraction). To be more specific, the peak around \(w_{MVb}\) values of \(-0.2\) is dominated by \(b\)-jets having no reconstructed vertex, while the peak around \(w_{MVb}\) values of approximately 0.2 is mostly populated by \(b\)-jets containing a vertex reconstructed by either the JetFitter or the iterative vertex finder. Jets having a vertex reconstructed by both tools correspond to the maxima in the regions around 0.6 and 0.95.

A quantification of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and the charm and light-flavour rejection strength of both taggers is presented in the following. In addition their performance is compared to the current ATLAS default \(b\)-tagging algorithm, MV1.

#### 5.2.1 Rejection rates for charm and light-flavour jets

The expected performance of the MVb and MVbCharm taggers is compared to that of the MV1 and the JetFitterCombNN algorithm in Figure 10. Their rejection rates for light-flavour jets are shown as a

Figure 9: Distribution of the MVb (a) and the MVbCharm (b) weights for all \(b\)-, \(c\)-, and light-flavour jets stemming from \(t\bar{t}\) events that are simulated with \(\sqrt{s}=8\). Only jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered.

function of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}\). Each working point on these curves corresponds to a different cut on the discriminant of these taggers, Also their relative performance with respect to MV1, the current ATLAS default \(b\)-tagger, is shown. The evaluation is performed using jets that are either from simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events produced according to the Standard Model predictions (a) or from events in which a hypothetical Kaluza-Klein gluon with the mass \(m_{g_{KK}}=2.5\) TeV decays to a boosted \(t\bar{t}\) system (b). The basic difference of these two samples is the distribution of their top quark \(p_{\rm T}\). While the top quarks produced according to the SM production mechanisms are mainly of low transverse momentum, a large fraction of the top quarks from the \(g_{KK}\to t\bar{t}\) samples have a transverse momentum above 400 GeV and provide therefore an ideal scenario to test the performance of the MVb and MVbCharm taggers, which are developed exactly for such environments. The MVb tagger shows a similar performance compared to the MV1 tagger in the SM \(t\bar{t}\) sample for working points corresponding to the interesting range of \(b\)-tagging efficiencies (\(0.65<\varepsilon_{b}<0.85\)). As the MVb tagger uses not only the IP3D weight as input, but also the IP2D weight, the jet width and the number of tracks with a large impact parameter significance, its performance is strongly improved with respect to the MV1 and JetFitterCombNN algorithm for jets having no reconstructed vertex. Also working points corresponding to \(b\)-tagging efficiencies between 50% and 60% show an improved light-flavour rejection rate (up to a factor of 1.3). In events where a high mass resonance of the KK-gluon decays into boosted top-antitop pairs, the performance of MVb is even better, by a factor of 1.5-2.5 (depending on the chosen working point).

Figure 10: Light-flavour rejection rates as a function of the \(b\)-tagging efficiency for jets stemming from two samples of simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events produced either according to the SM predictions (a) or from the decay of a Kaluza-Klein gluon (b). The performance of the MVb tagger (presented as a blue line) is compared to the MV1 (black line), JetFitterCombNN (red line) and the MVbCharm (gray line) taggers.

The overall performance of the MVbCharm tagger (in terms of the light-flavour rejection rate) is significantly worse than the performance of the other taggers in both the SM and the BSM \(t\bar{t}\) sample and for working points corresponding to \(b\)-tagging efficiencies below 85%. But as light-flavour jets are not included in its training procedure this behaviour is expected. Nevertheless, its light-flavour rejection rate is improved with respect to MV1 for \(\varepsilon_{\rm b}>90\%\). Rejection rates for \(c\)-jets are displayed in Figure 11 for the MVb, MVbCharm and MV1 taggers as a function of the corresponding \(b\)-tagging efficiency. Additionally the performance of the MV1c tagger, which is a modified version of MV1 and provides a better charm rejection, is shown. The performance of these taggers is again compared separately for a SM (a) and a BSM (b) \(t\bar{t}\) sample.

It can be seen that the charm rejection rate of the MVb tagger appears to be very similar in the SM \(t\bar{t}\) sample compared to the MV1 algorithm for any given \(b\)-tagging efficiency below 90%. The charm rejection rates corresponding to \(b\)-tagging efficiencies above 90% are, like the light-flavour rejection rates, improved with respect to those of the MV1 tagger due to the fact that MVb uses more input quantities that do not rely on the reconstruction of a secondary vertex. The same trend is observed in the comparison between MVb and MV1c for efficiencies above 70%, while the performance of MV1c is better for efficiencies below 70%. However, the performance of the MVbCharm algorithm is significantly better compared to the other \(b\)-taggers for any working point. Its charm rejection rate is improved with respect to MV1c by a factor of 1.5 for working points corresponding to efficiencies betw

The performance of the MVb (presented as a blue line) and the MVbCharm (gray line) tagger is compared to the performance of the MV1 (black line) and the MV1c (green line) algorithm.

same tendency can be observed in the jet sample obtained from the \(g_{KK}\to t\bar{t}\) decays with the difference that the performance of MVb is improved with respect to MV1c for working points corresponding to \(b\)-tagging efficiencies above 50%.

The light-flavour rejection rates of the MVb and MVbCharm taggers are presented as a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) in Figure 12. A representative operating point corresponding to an overall \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 70% (in the whole \(t\bar{t}\) sample) is chosen to compare it to the rejection rates of the MV1 algorithm. While the rejection rates of these three taggers behave qualitatively very similarly over the full range of the jet pseudorapidity values, significant differences can be observed for the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). The rejection rate of the MV1 tagger has its maximum for jets with low transverse momentum and decreases continuously with increasing \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). MVb and MVbCharm however have their maximum in the rejection factor for jets with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) around 120. The light-flavour rejection of MVb is superior to that of the MV1 algorithm in a range between 60 and 320, whereas it is similar for high \(p_{T}\) jets and slightly lower for jets with a transverse momentum below 60. The charm rejection rates for these three taggers are shown in the Figures 12 (c) and (d) as a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) using the same operating point. The performance of MVbCharm is strongly improved with respect to MV1c and MVb in a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range between 50 and 250 and in a \(\eta\) range between \(-\)1.5 and 1.5.

#### 5.2.2 Identification of \(b\)-jets in boosted top quark decays

An alternative presentation of the performance comparison between the MVb, MVbCharm and the current ATLAS default \(b\)-dagger, MV1, is presented in Figures 13 (a) and (b), where the efficiency dependence on the minimal distance of a \(b\)-jet to the quarks originating from the hadronic decay of a \(W\)-boson and the jet axis shift are shown. As both quantities are very sensitive to a jet overlap they are perfect candidates to display the improvement from the MVb and MVbCharm taggers compared to the current ATLAS tools when they are applied to dense environments. It can be seen that the performance of the different taggers is very similar for a given working point if the alignment between the \(b\)-hadron and the jet is perfect. Indeed the \(b\)-tagging efficiency of the MVb and MVbCharm taggers decreases as well for increasing values of the angular separation between the \(b\)-hadron and the jet. The loss of efficiency is however less significant and an improvement by a factor of up to 1.5 is shown for the various \(\Delta R\) values. In a comparison between the Figures 13 (a) and 4 a difference in the efficiency loss can be observed, which is mainly due to the different kinematics of the top quarks and their decay products. The same holds for the results presented in the Figures 13 (b) and 5.

#### 5.2.3 Performance in non-top quark final states

In order to demonstrate that the MVb and MVbCharm algorithm do not only improve the identification of \(b\)-jets in strongly boosted hadronic top quark decays but also in other topologies, both taggers are applied to further extreme scenarios. Their performance is compared to the MV1 tagger. In the following jets from the decays of a hypothetical Randall-Sundrum graviton with the mass \(m_{G^{*}}=2\) TeV are used for this purpose as well as high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets from the QCD dijet production. Both comparisons are performed for a representative working point corresponding to an overall efficiency of 70% as evaluated for all three taggers in the SM \(t\bar{t}\) sample.

Figure 14 (a) displays the \(b\)-tagging efficiency of the MVb, MVbCharm and the MV1 algorithm for jets stemming from the \(G^{*}\to hh\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) decay as a function of the transverse momentum of the Higgs boson from which the corresponding \(b\)-jets originated. The Higgs bosons appearing in these decays are assumed to have a mass of 125 GeV and Standard Model like properties. For a Higgs \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) below 400 GeV

Figure 13: \(b\)-tagging efficiencies of the MV1, MVb and MVbCharm algorithms as a function the \(\Delta R\) between the reconstructed \(b\)-jets and the nearest quark from the \(W\to q\bar{q}\) decay (a) and of the distance between the flight direction of the \(b\)-hadron and the \(b\)-jet axis (b). Both plots are evaluated for a sample containing \(g_{KK}\to t\bar{t}\) events with a KK-gluon mass of 2.5 TeV. The algorithms are compared for a working point corresponding to 70% in the SM \(t\bar{t}\) sample.

all taggers show a very similar performance since the two resulting \(b\)-hadrons are often clustered into two individual jets. With increasing \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the Higgs bosons the angular separation between the two hadrons will decrease and it becomes more likely that both will be clustered into one jet. As can be seen the performance of both the MVb and MVbCharm algorithm is degraded less although they do not exploit the double \(b\)-hadron topology resulting into two secondary vertices.

In addition, the ratio between the \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{b}}\) and the mis-tagging efficiency for light-flavour jets is shown in Figure 14 (b) for a working point corresponding to an overall efficiency of 70% and as a function of the transverse momentum of the jets obtained from the sum of the simulated QCD dijet samples described in Section 2. In the search for heavy resonances decaying into a \(b\bar{b}\) final state, jets are investigated whose transverse momentum extends to values above the \(\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) scale. Thus a good \(b\)-tagging performance for high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets is highly desirable. Indeed the MVb tagger shows a significantly better performance for high \(p_{T}\) jets obtained from QCD dijet events than the MV1 algorithm since the ratio between the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and the light-flavour rejection rate corresponding to MVb is improved by a factor of 1.2 to 2 with respect to MV1. This particular representation is chosen as not only the light-flavour rejection rates of the MV1 and MVb algorithms decrease strongly with increasing jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (see Figure 12 (a)), but also their \(b\)-tagging efficiency itself if the transverse momenta of the studied jets exceed values of \(500\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). Thus a fair performance comparison at very high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is not possible from studying only the light-flavour rejection rate. These two comparisons underline that both the MVb and the MVbCharm tagger are not only better adjusted to identify \(b\)-jets in boosted top quark decays but also in the decay of a boosted boson into two \(b\)-quarks or in the case of high \(b\)-jet transverse momentum.

## 6 Conclusions

The performance of the current ATLAS \(b\)-tagging algorithms was studied in the context of boosted \(t\to bW\to bqq\) decays. Information at the generator level is used to identify particle jets reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius parameter of 0.4 containing \(b\)-quarks and at least one of the decay products of the \(W\)-boson. The properties of these jets are compared to the properties of jets having no

Shown are the \(b\)-tagging efficiency as a function of the Higgs \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the ratio \(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{b}}/\varepsilon_{\mathrm{light}}\) as a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) respectively. Both comparisons are performed for a working point corresponding to an overall efficiency of 70%.

significant overlap in order to understand which of the \(b\)-tagging related quantities are sensitive to such an overlap and which are stable. Using this information, a new BDT-based \(b\)-tagging algorithm called MVb is constructed, dedicated to boosted topologies as it compensates for the loss of separation power of several variables used in the training of the BDT. For this purpose one jet shape related quantity is also included. The performance of this new tool is compared to that of the current ATLAS default \(b\)-tagger, for \(b\)-, \(c\), and light-flavour jets that are obtained from either simulated dijet or \(t\bar{t}\) events or also from decays of a hypothetical Kaluza-Klein gluon into top quark pairs. It was found that the MVb tagger performs similarly well in resolved topologies and shows improvements for boosted top quark decays between 50% and 160% in terms of light-flavour rejection rate at a constant \(b\)-tagging efficiency.
