## Abstract

The discovery potential of the ATLAS experiment for the Higgs bosons postulated in the Minimal Supersymmetric extension to the Standard Model (MSSM) can be extended to regions of large masses and large tan\(\beta>25\) by studying the \(\tau\) decay channel. In the present note the search for \(A/H\) decays into \(\tau\) pairs has been studied in the hadronic decay mode of both \(\tau\)'s for large masses (\(m_{A/H}>500\) GeV).

Due to the small production cross section for large masses and the high rates from QCD background and the absence of a trigger lepton, the first level trigger performance is of crucial importance. A study has been performed to estimate the signal acceptance and trigger rates. A high signal acceptance in the first level trigger can be achieved using standard trigger conditions, while retaining suitable trigger rates.

The study of signal and backgrounds shows that MSSM-Higgs bosons \(A/H\) can be discovered at ATLAS after \(\int{\cal L}\,dt=30\) fb\({}^{-1}\) for masses of \(m_{A/H}=600\) GeV for tan\(\beta>30\), and for masses of \(m_{A/H}=800\) GeV for tan\(\beta>45\). All results are for the low luminosity case.

Introduction

In the Standard Model, it is possible to give _up-type_ and _down-type_ quarks mass using a single Higgs doublet. The up-type quarks can get their mass from the charge conjugate of the Higgs doublet. However, this charge conjugation is not allowed in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM), therefore a second Higgs doublet is introduced to give masses to _up-type_ quarks [1]. The two Higgs doublets result in five physical states: two charged MSSM-Higgs bosons H\({}^{+}\), H\({}^{-}\) and three neutral ones: the neutral lighter scalar \(h\), and the heavier neutral scalar \(H\) and the neutral pseudoscalar \(A\). At tree level their masses can be computed in terms of only two parameters, typically chosen to be \(m_{A}\) and tan\(\beta\), which is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two doublets. The decay rates of H \(\rightarrow\tau\tau\) and A \(\rightarrow\tau\tau\) are strongly enhanced with respect to the Standard Model (SM) case over a large region of parameter space [2].

The \(A\) and \(H\) can be produced via two different mechanisms: for small values of tan\(\beta\), the _direct_ production rates \(gg\to A/H\rightarrow\tau\tau\) are dominant, while for large values of tan\(\beta\), the production is dominated by the _associated_ production \(q\overline{q},gg\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\ A/H\). For \(m_{A/H}~{}>~{}150\) GeV, the \(H\) and \(A\) are degenerated in mass, therefore their signal rates can be added. For the case of large tan\(\beta\), the \(A\) and \(H\) couple dominantly to the heaviest charged lepton, the \(\tau\), and to the heaviest down-type quark, the \(b\)-quark. The branching ratio of the \(A/H\) into b-quark pairs is \(\approx 90\%\), while \(\approx 10\%\) decay into \(\tau\) pairs.

The \(\tau\)'s produced in the decay of the \(A/H\) decay either into leptons (i.e. electrons or muons) with a branching ratio of \(\approx 35\%\) or hadronically into pions or kaons with a branching ratio of \(\approx 65\%\). The present note examines the fully hadronic decay channel, which accounts for \(41\%\) of all \(A/H\) decays. The decay channels with at least one lepton covering \(52.3\%\) have been studied in the lower mass region up to \(m_{A/H}~{}=~{}450\) GeV for the ATLAS Physics and Detector Performance TDR [3][4], and have recently been extended to higher masses [5]. The studies of the leptonic decay channels make use of the lepton signature in order to trigger the events and also reduce the background efficiently. The production cross sections of \(A/H\) in the high mass region are very low. To increase the sensitivity, it is therefore highly desirable to include all \(\tau\) decay channels into the analysis. Therefore, the decay channel with both \(\tau\)'s decaying into hadrons has been studied in the present note. The combination with the extended study of the leptonic decay modes for the high mass range \(m_{A/H}~{}>~{}450\) GeV can be found in Ref. [5].

In Section 2 the production cross sections are given in the mass region and tan\(\beta\) region under examination, together with the branching ratios into \(\tau\) pairs. Since the associated production process dominates the production at high masses, only this process is considered in the present simulation.

A very important detector requirement for this analysis is the possibility to reconstruct the invariant \(\tau\tau\) mass, which is described in Section 3.

The absence of leptons in the final state requires not only to apply strict selection criteria to strongly reduce the huge background of QCD jet- and top-pair production while retaining sufficient signal acceptance, but also to study the acceptance and rates of the first level trigger in detail, which is described in Section 4.

MSSM-Higgs boson masses between \(m_{A/H}=450\) and \(800\) GeV have been studied. The signatures of the signal and the relevant backgrounds are described in Section 5. The event selection has been optimised for high masses. The lower mass point has been chosen to allow for an overlap with the lepton/hadron studies presented in Ref. [3]. The analysis method and event selection are reported in Section 6. This study uses weighted events with weight factors derived from the \(\tau\)- and b-jet acceptance and the corresponding rejection values. A very good identification of hadronically decaying \(\tau\)'s is decisive for this analysis, since it allows to reject the huge jet background from various sources [7].

The significances for a signal for the four mass points considered are given in Section 7. Using these results, the discovery contour plot of the MSSM-Higgs bosons in the \((m_{A},\tan\!\beta)\) plane is extended towards high values of \(m_{A/H}\). The combined acceptance of the Level-1 trigger and offline analysis has been studied in Section 8, confirming a very good trigger acceptance for the events accepted by the offline analysis. Some systematic uncertainties linked to detector resolution, jet identification and jet energy scale have also been estimated as described in Section 9.

## 2 Production Cross Sections of \(A/h\)

There are considerable uncertainties in the evaluation of the lower order cross sections, as discussed in detail in Ref. [10]. A final state \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\)\(A/H\) can be produced in associated production in a gluon-gluon collision (\(gg\to A/H\)) or b-quark annihilation (\(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\ \to A/H\)) where the b-quarks are taken from the parton density functions (PDFs). Unfortunately, as discussed in Ref. [10], the two approaches give results which differ by a factor of

\begin{table}

about 2.5. A higher cross section is found for the b-quark annihilation calculation. The associated production approach has been used in the past [3], but recent theoretical work [11][12] suggests that the b-quark annihilation process should be a reliable approach for b-quarks. However, the correct generation of events with \(\rm b\overline{b}\;A/H\) final states in this approach should include next-to-leading order corrections, where the Higgs boson is produced at large transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)). Unfortunately the necessary corrections are not yet implemented in the PYTHIA Monte Carlo program current version 6.205 [16]. In addition, there are substantial uncertainties related to the b-quark PDFs.

In view of this, the standard associated production process (as shown in Fig. 5) has been used to calculate the relevant cross sections for the study presented here. Even in this production mode, considerable uncertainties in the cross section calculation appear. So far [3][13] the b-quark pole-mass has been used to evaluate the Yukawa couplings in the cross section calculation. If instead the running b-quark mass is used, significantly lower cross sections are obtained. Calculations have been performed using both the PYTHIA Monte Carlo version 6.205 and the HQQ Monte Carlo [9]. The results as a function of \(\rm tan\beta\) and \(m_{A}\) are given for the different calculations in Table 11 and 12 in the Appendix [14]. In all calculations the CTEQ5L structure function parametrisation has been used and the \(Q^{2}\) scale has been chosen to be \(Q^{2}=m_{H}\). For the running b-quark mass approach, good agreement between the PYTHIA and HQQ calculations is found applying the same set of parameters.

For reasons of consistency with previous studies and due to the large theoretical uncertainties described above, the cross sections used in the present study are those calculated with the associated production process using the HQQ program with a fixed b-quark pole mass setting. The decay branching ratios have been derived using the program HDECAY [9]. The cross section values relevant for the present study are given in Table. 1 together with the branching ratio for the mass points and \(\rm tan\beta\) values relevant for this study, and shown in Fig. 1 as a function of \(m_{A}\).

The associated production is the dominant production process for high masses and \(\rm tan\beta\). The direct production cross section, which is given in Table 2, is a factor of 14 lower than the associated production given in Table 1 for \(m_{A/H}=450\) GeV and \(\rm tan\beta\)=25. For higher masses, the suppression is even stronger: the direct production cross section for \(m_{A/H}=800\) GeV and \(\rm tan\beta\)=45 is a factor of 34 smaller than for the associated production case. The branching ratio of the \(A/H\) into \(\tau\tau\) does not vary significantly over the mass range, it is about 11%.

## 3 Mass reconstruction in the \(\tau\tau\) channel

The invariant \(\tau\tau\) mass reconstruction is an important point in the \(\rm A\to\tau\tau\) analysis. This method has been adapted from Ref. [4]. The energies of the two \(\tau\)'s are evaluated from the energies of the \(\tau\) decay products, which are assumed to have the same direction as the \(\tau\)-parent; the neutrino energies are obtained solving a system containing the two \(p_{T}^{miss}\) components. Therefore, it is crucial to have a very good \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution in the detector [6].

The invariant mass of the \(\tau\)-pair in can be reconstructed assuming that the neutrinos have the same direction as the visible \(\tau\) decay products. Under this assumption the energies of the two neutrino systems \(E_{\nu_{1}}\) and \(E_{\nu_{2}}\), where \(\nu_{1}=\overline{\nu_{\tau}}\) and \(\nu_{2}=\nu_{\tau}\), can be determined from a two component system of equations using the two \(p_{T}^{miss}\) components. The mass is given by:

\[m_{\tau\tau}\ =\ \sqrt{2(E_{1}+E_{\nu_{1}})(E_{2}+E_{\nu_{2}})(1-cos\theta)} \tag{1}\]

* \(E_{1}\), \(E_{2}\) are the energies of the measured \(\tau\)-decay products
* \(E_{\nu_{1}}\), \(E_{\nu_{2}}\) are the energies of the two neutrino systems from \(\tau\)-decay
* \(\theta\) is the angle between the directions of the measured \(\tau\)-decay products.

The measurement uncertainties on \(p_{x}^{miss}\), \(p_{y}^{miss}\) combined with the assumption on the directions of the decay-products often result in unphysical negative solutions for the neutrino energies. In that case the \(A\) mass cannot be reconstructed.

The mass resolution results are proportional to

\[\sigma(p_{T}^{miss})/|sin(\Delta\phi({\rm jet1-jet2}))| \tag{2}\]

therefore both the \(p_{T}^{miss}\) resolution and the \(\Delta\phi\) separation are important in the \(\tau\tau\) mass reconstruction [4].

## 4 Study of first level trigger efficiency and rates

Due to the very low production cross section of the \(A/H\) especially in the higher mass region between 500 GeV and 1000 GeV, the trigger acceptance for the signal needs to be as high as possible. However, the signature of the signal with only hadronic decays is similar to QCD-background, with the jets being misidentified as taus at trigger level.

Figure 1: Lowest order production cross section of the MSSM-Higgs boson \(A\) in pb as a function of \(m_{A}\), _left plot_: associated production, from HQQ with CTEQ5L; dashed line: tan\(\beta\)=45, solid line: tan\(\beta\)=30; the production cross sections of \(H\) are nearly identical. _right plot_: Branching ratio into two \(\tau\)’s from HDECAY [9].

In the first level trigger, the total rate of jet and \(\tau\) triggers is dominated by 2-jet QCD-background, which has to be controlled by appropriate high settings of the \(E_{T}\) thresholds for jet triggers [18]. However, these settings also reduce the trigger acceptance for the fully hadronic decay mode of the \(\tau\)'s from the \(A/H\) decay.

A method of improving the signal acceptance and at the same time retaining acceptable trigger rates is combining jet- and- \(\tau\) triggers with the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) trigger. High values of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) are characteristic for the signal due to the production of \(\tau\)-neutrinos. This characteristic feature is therefore not only used in the offline analysis, but already at trigger level. The trigger study is focused on finding an appropriate balance between a high signal acceptance using standard Level-1 trigger menu while at the same time limiting the trigger rate from QCD background to \(\leq 2\) kHz.

The fast trigger simulation ATL1CT1 interfaced to ATLFAST has been used for the study [18][19]. The standard Level-1 trigger conditions in the trigger menu for low luminosity have to be applied [17]. The following trigger types are of relevance for the acceptance of the hadron/hadron channel:

Footnote 1: ATL1CT - Webpage: [http://butler.physik.uni-mainz.de/](http://butler.physik.uni-mainz.de/)\(\sim\)mahouboi

* **Jet + \(E_{T}^{miss}\)** (Threshold: \(E_{\rm T}^{jet}\)\(>\) 50 GeV, \(E_{T}^{miss}\)\(>\) 50 GeV)
* \(\tau\) + \(E_{T}^{miss}\) (Threshold: \(E_{\rm T}^{\tau}\)\(>\) 20 GeV, \(E_{T}^{miss}\)\(>\) 30 GeV)
* **Single jet (\(E_{\rm T}^{jet}\)\(>\) 180GeV)**
* **Three jets (\(E_{\rm T}^{jet}\)\(>\) 75GeV)**
* **Four jets (\(E_{\rm T}^{jet}\)\(>\) 55GeV)**

The thresholds settings on the cluster \(E_{T}\) of the jets and \(\tau\)'s are given in Table 3. The method of estimating jet and \(\tau\)\(E_{T}\) values in the Level-1 trigger using croase granularity data results in a broad distribution of the \(E_{T}\) of jets which have the same \(E_{T}\) value in

Figure 2: The \(\tau\)-algorithm of the Level-1 Calorimeter Trigger based on cells of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) (_Trigger Towers_), isolation criteria on both electromagnetic and hadronic trigger towers are applied around cluster [17].

the offline reconstruction. This distribution is shown in Fig. 3. The thresholds in the Level-1 trigger are set to accept 90% of the jets with the \(E_{T}\) value given in the trigger menu, which is identified with the \(E_{T}\) value in the offline reconstruction [19].

An illustration of the \(\tau\) trigger algorithm is shown in Fig. 2. The algorithm uses \(4\times 4\) cells with \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) (called _Trigger Towers_), of which the inner \(2\times 2\) cells are demanded to include the majority of the energy deposited by the hadronic \(\tau\) decay products. Fixed isolation thresholds are separately applied for trigger towers from the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters in order to identify \(\tau\)'s and separate them from jets [17]. There are eight separate threshold settings available with a maximum multiplicity of seven each. Those settings have to be tuned in order to optimise jet/\(\tau\) separation and trigger rates, using the full simulation and eventually detector data.

The present study has been performed using one set of isolation cuts for all \(\tau\) triggers. The isolation threshold in both the hadronic and the electromagnetic trigger towers has been set to 4 GeV. This value was optimised by studying the isolation values from the trigger simulation of the signal events at \(m_{A}=600\) and 800 GeV and also the trigger rates.

The estimated trigger rates for the various jet and \(\tau\) triggers are given in Table 4. The total rate in the Level-1 trigger is determined by the number of events accepted by at least one of the triggers. This is equivalent to a logical _OR_. Many events are accepted by more than one trigger, therefore the total rate is smaller than the sum of the individual rates. The total trigger rate was evaluated to be 1.4 kHz, which fits well within the limitations given by the Level-1 trigger menu.

The acceptance of the Level-1 Trigger for signal events with \(m_{A/H}=450,~{}600\) and 800 GeV for the individual trigger types listed above and their combination (_OR_) is illustrated in

Figure 3: Reconstructed transverse energy in the Level-1-Trigger (L1CT) for jets of \(p_{T}~{}=~{}180-185\) GeV in offline reconstruction [19]. The threshold of the Level-1 jet triggers are set to accept 90% of those jets, in this case \(E_{\rm T}^{jet}\)= 113 GeV, see Table 3.

Fig. 4. For \(m_{A/H}=450\) GeV, a Level-1 input acceptance of 62.5% is reached, while for \(m_{A/H}=800\) GeV 76.3% of the events are accepted, with a significant contribution from the \(\tau\)-trigger.

The trigger study shows that a high input acceptance of the trigger for signal events (\(\rm{b\overline{b}}\ )A/H\rightarrow\ \tau\ (hadron)\ \tau\ (hadron)\) can be achieved by using combined jet+\(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(\tau\)+\(E_{T}^{miss}\) triggers. However, the input acceptance is not the critical value for this study: the influence of the trigger on the discovery potential is given by the combination of the trigger acceptance and offline acceptance. The relevant number is the fraction of events which have been selected by the Level-1 trigger, normalised to the event number selected in the offline analysis. As described in Section 8, this fraction is higher than the numbers quoted here.

## 5 Signatures of Signal and Backgrounds

The expected signal event topology is illustrated in Fig. 5 for the associated production. As already mentioned, the MSSM-Higgs bosons \(A\) and \(H\) are mass degenerated for \(m_{A/H}>150\) GeV. Therefore, the production and decay of those Higgs bosons are observed simultaneously and the production cross sections can be added. Four mass point have been examined in the present study: \(m_{A/H}=450,\ 600,\ 700\) and \(800\) GeV. The final state of the decay consists of the hadronic decay products of two \(\tau\)'s ('\(\tau\)-jets') with high transverse momentum and the two b-jets originating from the associated Higgs-boson production. Therefore, backgrounds are of relevance which generate also three or four jets, either from the hard process or as ISR or FSR, where the jets are misidentified as b-jets or \(\tau\)'s. The following backgrounds are included in this study:

* **W+jet**: Especially the events with the W decaying into \(\tau\ +\ \nu_{\tau}\) contribute to the background.
* \(\rm{t\overline{t}}\) with \(t\to Wb\), mainly where the W's decay into \(\tau\ +\ \nu_{\tau}\). This background shows the very same signature in the detector as the signal events, which makes it a very important background.

Figure 5: Associated production of the MSSM-Higgs boson \(A/H\) with two b-jets from gluon fusion, decay of the \(A/H\) into two \(\tau\)’s, hadronic decay of both \(\tau\)’s (’\(\tau\)-jets’).

* **QCD 2-jet**: This background consists predominantly of two back-to-back jets, however the jet multiplicity is increased by ISR and FSR. Together with \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) pairs from gluons, signatures similar to the signal can occur. Even if there are no real \(\tau\)'s and very few b-jets, this background is important due to its massive production cross section.
* **Z+jet**: Especially the events with the Z decaying into \(\tau\tau\) contribute to the background, \(\mathrm{b\overline{b}}\) pairs can be generated by gluon splitting.

## 6 Event Generation and Selection

The study of the discovery potential of the ATLAS experiment for the MSSM-Higgs bosons \(A/H\) in fully hadronic \(\tau\) decays has been performed using Monte Carlo events from the fast simulation ATLFAST 2.53 [15] with PYTHIA 6.152 [16] and CTEQ5L structure function2.

Footnote 2: To study differences between PYTHIA versions, Monte-Carlo datasets of the signal at the four masses and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background have been produced using PYTHIA 6.202. The differences in acceptance compared to the analysis presented here have been found to be below statistical uncertainties.

An overview of the Monte-Carlo samples used in the study is given in Table 5. Large sets of background samples have been produced in order to evaluate the significance up to very high masses.

The acceptance of the analysis towards background events is very low. Especially the QCD 2-jet events are rejected completely by the selection. Huge Monte Carlo samples of background events would be needed to reach the necessary statistics to give an estimate for the background contribution of QCD 2-jets if all events are treated with the usual weight of 1 per event. For this study, a different approach has been followed to solve this problem: Each event is given a weight which is derived from the identification efficiencies for the signatures.

All high-energetic jets above a chosen threshold are regarded as potential hadronically

decayed \(\tau\)'s and called \(\tau\)_-candidates_. Each \(\tau\)-candidate is weighted according to the \(\tau\)-identification efficiency. Real \(\tau\)'s are weighted with a factor of \(\mathrm{w}_{\tau}=\epsilon_{\tau}=0.55\), while QCD-Jets are weighted using the rejection factors \(R\) from a parametrisation of the \(\tau\)/jet separation using a weighting factor of \(\mathrm{w}_{\mathrm{Jet}}=1/R\). For \(p_{T,jet}<150\) GeV, the parametrisation described in Ref. [7] has been used in this study. An extension of this parametrisation, as described in detail in Ref. [5], has been applied for \(p_{T,jet}>150\) GeV. The following rejection factors can be achieved:

* \(150\) GeV \(<p_{T}<300\) GeV: Jet-Rejection: \(1666\) (\(\epsilon=6.0\cdot 10^{-4}\))
* \(p_{T}>300\) GeV: Jet-Rejection: \(2272\) (\(\epsilon=4.4\cdot 10^{-4}\))

The identification of b-jets is included into the event weighting in a corresponding manner applying the identification and misidentification factors from Ref. [3]. The b-jet tagging efficiency is assumed to be \(\epsilon_{b}=~{}70\%\) in order to improve the acceptance of signal events. This setting corresponds to a rejection factor towards c-jets of \(\mathrm{R}_{u}\approx 4\) towards light quark jets of \(\mathrm{R}_{c,g}\approx 25\).

Each Event is weighted using a factor \(\mathrm{W}_{\mathrm{event}}\) in the selection sequence, and finally the number of expected background events is scaled by this factor. Using this method, a substantially smaller number of background events are rejected, making it possible to quote background numbers even after all selection cuts.

The results have been compared to an analysis without event weighting for the signal and some background channels. The identification and misidentification factors have been implemented using random numbers, with real \(\tau\)'s and b-jets being required in the selection. The results obtained using this analysis have been found to agree within statistical uncertainties to the method using weighted events described in the present note.

The aim of the selection is to optimise the signal significance at a given mass, leading to a discovery \(\mathrm{tan}\beta\) value as low as possible. The selection has been optimised for the mass points \(m_{A/H}=600\) GeV and \(m_{A/H}=800\) GeV. The most important kinematic characteristics in the event selection are two \(\tau\)'s with high tranverse momentum - due to the high MSSM Higgs masses - and high values of missing transverse momentum. The event also must not contain any lepton (i.e. electron or muon) above a low \(p_{T,lep}\) threshold.

The distributions of the transverse momentum of the \(\tau\)-candidate with the highest transverse momentum is shown in Fig. 7 for signal and backgrounds. A cut at \(p_{T,\tau-Cand.}>100\) GeV is an efficient first selection criterium. The number of jets in the event is limited to 4 jets with \(p_{T,Jet}>20\) GeV, which is an important cut against \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) background. The distributions of the missing transverse momentum are shown in Fig. 8. Low values of \(p_{T}^{miss}\) are characteristic for the W+jet and QCD 2-jet background, which can be efficiently rejected by requiring \(p_{T}^{miss}~{}>65\) GeV. However, the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) and Z+jet backgrounds also include a significant fraction of events with high \(p_{T}^{miss}~{}\) and this cut also rejects many signal events.

The b-tagging is extremely important to reject QCD 2-jet background. Only one identified b-jet is required in the selection in order to keep the efficiency high. The angle between the two \(\tau\) candidates is also used to suppress the backgrounds: For 2-jet QCD, back-to-back jets are expected, while for Z+jet, there is also a fraction of events with small angles between the \(\tau\)'s. This topology is caused by back-to-back directions of the Z and the jet,with the Z decaying into two \(\tau\)'s, which follow the direction of the Z. The cut has been optimised to be \(\Delta\phi=145-175^{\circ}\).

The transverse mass of the (\(\tau\), \(p_{T}^{miss}\))-system is calculated for both \(\tau\)'s:

\[m_{T}=\sqrt{2\cdot p_{T,\tau}\cdot\ p_{T}^{miss}\ \cdot(1-cos\Delta\phi(\tau,p_{T} ^{miss}))} \tag{3}\]

This variable is especially useful to suppress the W+jet background. For events W \(\rightarrow\ \tau\nu\), a transverse mass of the order of the W mass is expected, while for the signal, small values of \(m_{T}\) are expected. The minimum of \(m_{T}(\tau_{1},p_{T}^{miss})\) and \(m_{T}(\tau_{2},p_{T}^{miss})\) is used in the selection. The selection cut is set at \(m_{T}<50\) GeV. Finally, the mass recontruction of \(m_{A/H}\) is performed as described in Section 3. The distributions for the four Higgs masses studied are shown in Figure 6. A mass window of 1.5 \(\sigma\) (RMS) on the reconstructed mass determined from a Gaussian fit is applied. For \(m_{A/H}=450\), a mass resolution of \(\sigma(m_{A/H})\ =\ 60.9\ \mathrm{GeV}\) can be achieved, while the resolution for \(m_{A/H}=800\) is \(\sigma(m_{A/H})\ =\ 126.7\ \mathrm{GeV}\). Comparing these values to the study of the lepton/hadron channel described in Ref. [3], where the resolution for \(m_{A/H}=450\) is \(\sigma(m_{A/H})\ =\ 52.4\ \mathrm{GeV}\) using events from both direct and associated production, the mass resolution is similar. As already mentioned the direct production channel is not used in the study presented here.

To summarise, the following selection criteria have been applied:

1. **Two \(\tau\)'s** found in the event with \(p_{T,\tau}>100\ \mathrm{GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\)
2. **No lepton** with \(p_{T,lep}>10\ \mathrm{GeV}\)
3. **Not more than 4 jets** in \(|\eta|<3.2\) with \(p_{T,jet}>20\ \mathrm{GeV}\)
4. At least **one b-jet tagged**
5. Missing transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{miss}\)\(>\)**65 GeV**
6. \(\Delta\phi\) **between \(\tau\)-candidates:**\(145-175^{\circ}\)
7. **transverse mass cut:**\(m_{T}<50\ \mathrm{GeV}\)
8. **reconstruction of \(m_{A/H}\)** from \(\tau\tau\)-system succesful
9. **mass window cut** of \(\pm 1.5\ \sigma\) around the \(m_{A/H}\) mass

The expected rate of the signal events after the various cuts is listed in Table 6. The corresponding numbers for the background channels are given in Table 7. It is clearly visible that some cuts lower the signal acceptance significantly, especially the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and jet multiplicity cuts. However, these hard cuts are necessary to suppress the background channels efficiently and thereby raising the signal significance above the discovery limit of 5 \(\sigma\).

Signal significance and discovery contour

The signal and the background rates for the four masses \(m_{A/H}=450\), 600, 700 and 800 GeV for tan\(\beta=25\), 30, 35 and 45 and for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) are given in Table 8, together with the expected signal significances. The signal rates correspond to the summed \(A+H\) production. Due to the small number of both signal and background events, the signal significance has been calculated using Poisson statistics. The main background is the \(\rm t\overline{t}\) for all mass points, especially at \(m_{A/H}=600\) GeV, where it contributes half of the total background. The QCD 2-Jet background can be effectively rejected by the selection cuts. The results presented here can be combined with the extended study of the lepton/hadron channel for the high mass range in order to improve the statistics and discovery potential (see Ref. [5]). Comparing the background composition to the study of the lepton/hadron channel, W+Jet and Z+Jet are larger contributions to the background here, while \(\rm t\overline{t}\) is the dominating background in both studies.

The discovery contour plot is shown in Fig. 10 in a logarithmic scale for tan\(\beta\). The results of this study are shown for \(m_{A}>450\) GeV. For \(m_{A}<450\) GeV the discovery contour from the lepton-hadron channel as reported in the TDR is given for comparison. The signal of the \(A/H\), which is derived from the reconstructed mass of the \(\tau\)\(\tau\) system, is shown in Fig. 9 for masses of \(m_{A}=600\) at tan\(\beta=30\) and \(m_{A}=800\) GeV at tan\(\beta=45\) superimposed on the background.

## 8 Combined acceptance of Level-1 trigger and

offline analysis

In order to estimate the influence of the Level-1 trigger acceptance on the significance of the signal and therefore the discovery contour of the \(A/H\rightarrow\ \tau\ (had)\ \tau\ (had)\) channel, the analysis described in the previous sections is combined with a simulation of the Level-1 trigger. Only those events have been used in the analysis, which have been accepted by the trigger. Trigger settings as given in Section 4 have been applied, using mainly combined \(Jet+E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(\tau+E_{T}^{miss}\) triggers. The ratio of the number of events accepted by both the trigger and the offline analysis and the number of events accepted by the offline analysis after each cut is given in Table 9. In general, the ratio of events accepted by the trigger increases in the sequence of cuts. This can be explained by the similarity of the kinematic characteristics used in the Level-1 trigger and in the offline analysis, which both require large values of \(E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(\tau\)'s with high transverse momentum \(p_{T}\). While the trigger requires those conditions already at the input level, they are used in the offline analysis later in the selection. This explains the lower acceptance ratio before the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) cut.

For the highest mass point \(m_{A/H}=800\) GeV, where the trigger acceptance is especially crucial due to the small number of accepted events, 94.9% of the events used in the offline analysis are accepted by the Level-1 trigger. The Level-1 trigger is therefore capable of

## 9 Systematic uncertainties

In order to estimate systematic uncertainties of this study, the influence of various effects on the signal significance have been investigated. The following three scenarios have been studied:

* **Detector resolution:** A worse resolution in the reconstruction of the missing transverse momentum \(p_{T}^{miss}\) results in a broader distribution of the reconstructed mass of the \(A/H\). In order to estimate this effect, the mass window has been increased by 20% to 1.8 \(\sigma\) (RMS). The signal acceptance has been kept at the value of the standard analysis.
* **Identification of the \(\tau\) and b-jets:** An efficiency of the \(\tau\)-identification of 55% has been used in this study. This values has been decrease to 40%, while the jet rejection values remain unchanged. The b-tagging efficiency has been lowered from \(\epsilon_{b}=0.7\) to \(\epsilon_{b}=0.6\), while keeping the same rejection factors.
* **Jet energy scale:** The absolute jet energy scale at the ATLAS experiment are estimated to be known with \(\pm 3\%\) accuracy. Therefore, all jet energies in the study have been raised by 3% to estimate the effect of this uncertainty, which alters the acceptance due to the cuts of the transverse energy of jets used in the event selection.

The changes on the signal significance compared to the standard analysis are given in Table 10. A less accurate detector resolution results in a degradation of the significance by 12%. The change to the jet energy scale is lowering the significance by 8%. Those two effects do not have an impact on the signal significance serious enough to decrease the discovery potential significantly.

The variation of the \(\tau\) identification and b-tagging efficiencies however clearly show that high efficiencies are crucial for this analysis. The significance decreases by 25% applying the pessimistic scenario.

## 10 Conclusions

A study of the fully hadronic \(\tau\) decay channel of the MSSM-Higgs bosons \(A/H\) has been performed. For large tan\(\beta\) values the production is dominated by the associated production \(\rm b\overline{b}\)\(A/H\), therefore only this process has been studied. The production cross sections of this channel are subject to large theoretical uncertainties depending on the approach taken in the calculations. For consistency with previous studies, calculations of the associated production (\(gg\to A/H\)) from HQQ with fixed b-quark mass are used here. The event selection has been optimised to reject the huge hadronic backgrounds from QCD 2-Jets and \(\rm t\overline{t}\) using kinematical cuts, \(\tau\)-identication and b-tagging.

The study shows that MSSM-Higgs bosons \(A/H\) can be discovered at ATLAS with an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) for masses of \(m_{A/H}=600\) GeV for tan\(\beta>30\), and for masses of \(m_{A/H}=800\) GeV for tan\(\beta>45\). All results are for the low luminosity case. A further improvement of the discovery potential can be achieved by combining the results with the complementary leptonic decay channels (see Ref. [5]). It has also been shown that the ATLAS Level-1 trigger does not strongly reduce the signal significance. More than 90% of the events accepted by the offline analysis are expected to be triggered by the standard ATLAS Level-1 trigger \(\tau\)- and jet-trigger with \(E_{T}^{miss}\) signatures.
