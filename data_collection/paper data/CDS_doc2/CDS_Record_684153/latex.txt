## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS Generic Detector Description (AGDD) group [1] has suggested that the detector geometry database be stored in an XML file. Such a file could be used for the simulation, reconstruction and visualisation packages.

The first attempt to write an XML file for the Hadronic End Cap calorimeter of the ATLAS detector is presented in this note.

## 2 Geometry definition

Each of the two Hadronic End Cap calorimeters (HEC) of ATLAS consists of a front (HEC1) and rear (HEC2) wheels made of a number of copper plates separated by thin liquid Argon gaps where the electrodes are placed. The faces of the front wheels are situated at a distance of 462.2 cm from the beam crossing vertex, inside the end-cap LArg cryostat.

The following XML code positions the wheels within the ATLAS detector.

where HEC1 is made up of FrontAbsorber and Depth1, Depth2 and Depth3, and where HEC2 consists of Absorber2 and Depth4-7. Note that there are four samplings for the readout, collecting the signals from: (i) Depth 1, (ii) Depth 2 + Depth 3, (iii) Depth 4 + Depth 5 and (iv) Depth 6 + Depth 7.

In order to facilitate the entry of the geometrical parameter values of the pads in an XML file, a java program has been written. The source of this program is available in [4].

The pads are described as solid volumes of type "tubs" in the following way:<tubs name="Pad1_01" material="LArgon" Rio_Z="185.30 203.0 0.85" profile="264.37 270.0" />

<tubs name="Pad1_02" material="LArgon" Rio_Z="185.30 203.0 0.85" profile="270.0 275.62" />

<tubs name="Pad1_03" material="LArgon" Rio_Z="166.38 185.30 0.85" profile="264.37 270.0" />

....

<tubs name="Pad1_24" material="LArgon" Rio_Z="37.200 39.741 0.85" profile="264.37 275.62"/>

<tubs name="Pad2_01" material="LArgon" Rio_Z="196.83 203.0 0.85" profile="264.37 270.0" />

<tubs name="Pad2_02" material="LArgon" Rio_Z="196.83 203.0 0.85" profile="270.0 275.62" />

....

<tubs name="Pad7_24" material="LArgon" Rio_Z="47.5 53.952 0.85" profile="264.37 275.62"/>

They are included in the top volume of the corresponding Pad1,... Pad7 using the "composition" feature of AGDD.

The electrode boards, being dead material, are not divided into pads, but are also included in the top volume of the seven pad structures Pad1,...Pad7 as one plate. In fig. 2 is shown

the Pad1 structure with three electrode boards physically shifted from the Pad1 top volume for clarity. The Pad1_01,... Pad1_24 volumes are drawn with a little distance between them, also for clarity. The XML code producing the "composition" for the top volume Pad1 is the following:

<composition name="Pad1">  <posXYZ volume="Pad1_01" X_Y_Z="0. 0. 0." layer value="1" />  <posXYZ volume="Pad1_02" X_Y_Z="0. 0. 0." layer value="2" /> ...... <posXYZ volume="Pad1_24" X_Y_Z="0. 0. 0." layer value="24" />  <posXYZ volume="Estboard" X_Y_Z="0. 0. -0.22137" index="0 0 1" />  <posXYZ volume="Padboard" X_Y_Z="0. 0. 0." index="0 0 2" />  <posXYZ volume="Estboard" X_Y_Z="0. 0. 0.22137" index="0 0 3" /> </composition>

The assembled Pad1 structure, with electrode boards inside, is depicted in fig. 3. In order to show clearly the internal structure of the volume, one of the small sensitive volumes, Pad1_11, is taken out.

In the XML file, the numbering of all the sensitive volumes is the same as in the TDR and it is unique. The identification scheme is summarised in the Table 1.

The hierarchical structure of volumes can also be displayed with the "tree" command of persint. In fig. 4 is persen

Figure 2: Detailed view of a pad structure (right plate). Three electronic boards are shown separately on the left.

## 4 Absorbers

The widths of the Cu standard absorber plates are 2.5 cm for the front wheel of the calorimeter and 5 cm for the rear wheel. In fig. 5 is shown the first depth of one module of HEC1, with its pad structure and Cu absorbers. The absorbers are moved out for clarity. Each absorber plate with the gap which follows constitutes the top volume "Slice" with "composition" tag:

<composition name="Slice1">  <posXYZ volume="Absorber" X_Y_Z="0. -1.02 -0.425" layer value="1"/>  <posXYZ volume="Padi" X_Y_Z="0. 0. 1.25" layer value="2"/>  </composition>  <composition name="Slice2">  <posXYZ volume="Absorber2" X_Y_Z="0. -1.02 -0.425" layer value="1"/>  <posXYZ volume="Pad2" X_Y_Z="0. 0. 1.25" layer value="2"/>  </composition> .......  <composition name="Slice7">  <posXYZ volume="Absorber3" X_Y_Z="0. -1.02 -0.425" layer value="1"/>  <posXYZ volume="Pad7" X_Y_Z="0. 0. 2.5" layer value="2"/>  </composition>

Figure 3: Detailed view of the Pad volume with two Estboard and one Padboard inside. This is the gap between two copper plates that is filled up with liquid Argon.

Finally Slices are positioned in their corresponding section with the multipositioning tag "mposZ" in the following way:

<composition name="Depth1">  <mposZ volume="Slice1" ncopy="8" dZ="3.3501" Z0="-11.725" layer value="1"/> </composition>  <composition name="Depth2">  <mposZ volume="Slice2" ncopy="8" dZ="3.3501" Z0="-11.725" layer value="1"/> </composition> .... <composition name="Depth7">  <mposZ volume="Slice7" ncopy="4" dZ="5.8501" Z0="-8.775" layer value="1"/> </composition>

All absorber plates, including the ones in front of each wheel are not divided, but are considered as single volumes. In fig. 6 is shown Slice 1 and in fig. 7 one depth of a wheel of the HEC, as drawn by persint. One module is depicted in fig. 8 and finally one complete two-wheel system of the HEC is shown in fig. 9.

## 5 Conclusions

The geometry description in XML language has been presented in this note. An identification scheme for the geometrical volumes of the calorimeter is suggested. Details of the codes described here can be found in [4].

The next steps could be to include more details of the geometry, such as the tie-rods. This XML code can then be implemented into the Geant4 simulation package.
