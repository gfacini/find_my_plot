Introduction

The production of prompt photons in proton-proton collisions, \(pp\to\gamma+\mathrm{X}\), provides a testing ground for perturbative QCD (pQCD) in a cleaner environment compared to jet production, since it is less affected by hadronisation effects. At leading order (LO) in pQCD, two processes contribute to prompt photon production in \(pp\to\gamma+\mathrm{X}\): the direct-photon process, in which the photon originates directly from the hard interaction, and the fragmentation-photon process, in which the photon is emitted in the fragmentation of a high transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) parton [1, 2].

Measurements of prompt-photon production at a hadron collider necessitate an isolation requirement to avoid the large contribution of photons from neutral-hadron decays. The production of inclusive isolated photons in \(pp\) collisions has been measured previously by ATLAS [3, 4, 5] and CMS [6, 7] at a centre-of-mass energy (\(\sqrt{s}\)) of 7 TeV.

This note presents a preliminary study of isolated-photon production in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using an integrated luminosity of \(6.4\pm 0.6\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The data used in this analysis were collected with the ATLAS detector during the second week of proton-proton collisions with stable beams in June 2015.

## 2 ATLAS detector

The ATLAS experiment [8] at the LHC is a multi-purpose particle detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and a near \(4\pi\) coverage in solid angle. It consists of an inner tracking detector surrounded by a thin superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field, electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters, and a muon spectrometer. The inner tracking detector covers the pseudorapidity1 range \(|\eta|<2.5\). It consists of silicon pixel, silicon micro-strip, and transition radiation tracking detectors. Within the region \(|\eta|<3.2\), electromagnetic (EM) calorimetry is provided by high-granularity lead liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic sampling calorimeters, with an additional thin LAr presampler covering \(|\eta|<1.8\), to correct for energy loss in material upstream of the calorimeters. A hadron (iron/scintillator-tile) calorimeter covers the central pseudorapidity range (\(|\eta|<1.7\)). The end-cap and forward regions are instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both EM and hadronic energy measurements up to \(|\eta|=4.9\). The muon spectrometer surrounds the calorimeters and is based on three large air-core toroid superconducting magnets with eight coils each. It includes a system of precision tracking chambers and fast detectors for triggering.

Footnote 1: The ATLAS reference system is a Cartesian right-handed coordinate system, with the nominal collision point at the origin. The anticlockwise beam direction defines the positive \(z\)-axis, while the positive \(x\)-axis is defined as pointing from the collision point to the centre of the LHC ring and the positive \(y\)-axis points upwards. The azimuthal angle \(\phi\) is measured around the beam axis, and the polar angle \(\theta\) is measured with respect to the \(z\)-axis. Pseudorapidity is defined as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\), and transverse energy is defined as \(E_{\mathrm{T}}=E\sin\theta\).

## 3 Data selection

The data sample used in this analysis consists of events recorded online using a single-photon trigger, with a nominal transverse energy threshold of 120 GeV. The selection criteria applied by the trigger to shower-shape variables computed from the energy profiles of the showers in the calorimeters are looser than the photon identification criteria applied in the offline analysis. For isolated photons of transverse energy \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}=125\) GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta^{\gamma}|<2.37\), the trigger efficiency is \(\gtrsim 98\%\). The average number of interactions per bunch crossing is \(\langle\mu\rangle\approx 20\) for this data sample.

For the selection of the isolated-photon sample, only events taken during stable beam conditions were considered. Detector and data-quality requirements were also imposed. The events were required to have at least one reconstructed primary vertex, with at least two associated tracks, consistent with the average beam-spot position.

The selection of photon candidates is based on the reconstruction of isolated electromagnetic clusters in the calorimeter and the absence of an associated track in the inner detector ("unconverted" photons). To recover photon conversions to electron-positron pairs, clusters matched to pairs of tracks originating from reconstructed conversion vertices in the inner detector or to single tracks with no hit in the innermost layer of the inner detector were considered as "converted" photon candidates.

A dedicated energy calibration was applied to the candidates to account for upstream energy loss and lateral and longitudinal energy leakage. Photon candidates reconstructed near regions of the calorimeter affected by readout or high-voltage failures were rejected. Events with at least one photon candidate with calibrated \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}>125\) GeV and \(|\eta^{\gamma}|<2.37\) were selected. Candidates in the transition region (\(1.37<|\eta^{\gamma}|<1.56\)) between the barrel and the end-caps were rejected.

The background from non-prompt photons originating from decays of energetic \(\pi^{0}\) and \(\eta\) mesons inside jets was suppressed by means of shower-shape techniques. The shower-shape requirements applied to the candidates are similar to those described in previous publications ("tight" identification criteria) [3, 4, 5].

The photon candidate was required to be isolated based on the amount of transverse energy inside a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) in the \(\eta-\phi\) plane centred around the photon direction. The isolation transverse energy, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}\), was computed from topological cell clusters [9]. The measured value of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}\) was corrected for the leakage of the photon energy and the estimated contributions from the underlying event and additional inelastic \(pp\) interactions. The latter correction was computed on an event-by-event basis [4]. After these corrections, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}\) was required to be lower than \(4.8\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{GeV}+4.2\cdot 10^{-3}\cdot E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\), which corresponds to a cut on \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{iso}}\) of \(5.3\leavevmode\nobreak\ \mathrm{GeV}\) for \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}=125\) GeV. The above requirements select approximately 2400 events.

## 4 Monte Carlo simulations

The Sherpa 2.1.1 [10] Monte Carlo (MC) program was used to generate simulated events to study the characteristics of the signal. In this generator, the partonic processes are simulated using leading-order matrix elements with up to three additional partons, with the inclusion of initial- and final-state parton showers. Fragmentation into hadrons was performed using a modified version of the cluster model [11]. The NLO CT10 [12] parton distribution functions (PDFs) were used to parameterise the proton structure. The MC samples include a simulation of the underlying event and additional inelastic \(pp\) interactions. The samples of generated events were passed through the Geant 4-based [13] ATLAS detector- and trigger-simulation programs [14]. They were reconstructed and analysed by the same program chain as the data.

## 5 Observation of the signal

A non-negligible background contribution remains in the selected data sample, even after the application of the tight identification and isolation requirements on the selected photon candidate. This background comes predominantly from multi-jet processes, in which a jet is misidentified as a photon. These jets usually contain a light neutral meson, mainly a \(\pi^{0}\) decaying into two collimated photons, which carries most of the jet energy.

A data-driven subtraction method was applied to remove the background. For this procedure, a data sample was obtained by applying all the selection criteria as described in Section 3, except for the isolation and the tight identification requirements; the latter was replaced by looser identification criteria. The selected events were divided into two subsamples according to whether the photon candidate satisfied the tight identification ("tight" subsample) criteria or not ("non-tight" subsample); the latter subsample is dominated by background events. The proper normalisation of the background subsample was obtained by scaling the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm iso}\) distribution for the non-tight events to the integral of the tight subsample in the range \(10<E_{\rm T}^{\rm iso}<25\) GeV, where the contribution from the signal is small. The \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm iso}\) distributions for these two subsamples are shown in Fig. 1. The background contribution obtained in this way for the phase-space region considered amounts to \((4.8\pm 0.3\) (stat.))%, which was subtracted from the data to derive the final signal yield. As a cross-check, this background estimation was also performed in separate regions of \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma}\) and the results were found to be consistent with the value above.

Figure 1: _The measured \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm iso}\) distribution after applying the tight identification requirement (dots) and for those events which fail the tight identification (“non-tight”) (open circles). The “non-tight” distribution was normalised such that the integrals of the “tight” and “non-tight” distributions in the range \(10<E_{\rm T}^{\rm iso}<25\) GeV coincide. The green line illustrates the requirement \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm iso}<E_{\rm T,cut}^{\rm iso}\) for \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma}=125\) GeV; in this region, the estimated background contribution is \((4.8\pm 0.3\) (stat.))%._

Kinematic distributions

The measured signal photon yields as functions of \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma}\) and \(|\eta^{\gamma}|\) are shown in Fig. 2. They are compared to simulated Sherpa events normalised to the total yield observed in data. Good agreement with data is observed.

The main sources of systematic uncertainty that affect the MC predictions are the photon energy scale (\(2-8\%\)), the photon energy resolution (\(<1\%\)), the photon identification efficiency (\(1-2\%\)), the trigger efficiency (\(2\%\)) and the modelling of \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm iso}\) in the MC (\(<1\%\)). The sum in quadrature of these uncertainties is shown as a shaded band in Figs. 2(b) and 2(d). An uncertainty of \(\pm 5\%\) was conservatively assigned to the background subtraction, to account for the contribution of the signal in the non-tight subsample and the correlation between the photon identification and isolation. The sum in quadrature of this uncertainty and the statistical uncertainty is represented as an additional error bar in Figs. 2(b) and 2(d).

Summary

Inclusive isolated-photon production in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV has been studied with the ATLAS detector at the LHC using an integrated luminosity of 6.4 pb\({}^{-1}\). A sample of photons at high transverse energy has been identified using the characteristics of the shower shapes in the calorimeter. Both converted and unconverted photons were included in the sample. The photons were required to be isolated by rejecting those candidates in which the transverse energy in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) around their direction was larger than \(4.8\) GeV \(+\)\(4.2\cdot 10^{-3}\cdot E_{\rm T}^{\gamma}\). A data-driven subtraction method was applied to remove the background from multi-jet processes, in which a jet is misidentified as a photon. As a result of this analysis, a clear signal of inclusive isolated photons at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV has been observed for the first time in the phase-space region given by \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma}>125\) GeV and \(|\eta^{\gamma}|<2.37\), excluding the region \(1.37<|\eta^{\gamma}|<1.56\). The kinematic distributions of the signal yield as functions of \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma}\) and \(|\eta^{\gamma}|\) have been studied. The simulation of the signal by Sherpa provides a good description of the shape of the measured kinematic distributions.
