**Atlas policy on radiation tolerant electronics**

**VERSION 1**

## 1 Introduction.

By radiation tolerant electronics we mean electronics which has to survive to a total dose in the range of a few 10 Gy to a few kGy and to a neutron fluence lower or equal to 10\({}^{13}\) cm-2. This concerns the electronics located in between the calorimeter gap and the cavern (included).

The radiation levels at the electronics locations has been computed by A. Ferrari. The results are given in the following tables and in the colour plots at the end of this note.

Before using them, the following remarks from A. Ferrari must be taken into account.

In Table 1, the column n/cm\({}^{\uplambda}\)2/yr gives ALL (down to thermal) neutrons in units of n/cm\({}^{\uplambda}\)2/yr @ 1x10\({}^{\uplambda}\)34. The following one gives silicon damage in 1 MeV equivalent neutrons/cm\({}^{\uplambda}\)2/yr @ 1x10\({}^{\uplambda}\)34. Dose means total absorbed dose in Gy/yr @ 1x10\({}^{\uplambda}\)34. (1 year = 10\({}^{\uplambda}\)7 s)

Numbers are given as: A +- B x/ C, where A is the computed fluence/dose, B the statistical error in percent, C the uncertainty factor the quoted value (A) has to be multiplied/divided for.

Warnings:

* Doses are local absorbed doses in the location corresponding to the given coordinates in the description of the detector A. Ferrari has used. This means that they must be interpreted as doses to the material of that point (in air, in aluminium etc). Generally dose is NOT a continuous quantity through material changes (while fluence is continuous), therefore the dose to the sensitive material of the electronics can be different from the quoted values if the compositions are different. Furthermore in the gap and in the external parts of the detector (hall included) neutrons are dominating -\(\cdot\)- the dose can change dramatically (easily up to a factor 10) depending on material composition and in particular to the hydrogen content.
* Uncertainties DO NOT include geometrical uncertainties, that is they do not account for any difference in geometry/materials between the simulated set-up and the real one. They only include "physical" and "MonteCarlo" uncertainties, that is source term uncertainty, showering uncertainty (which varies with position being maximum in the hall due to the large attenuation of the detector and the strong sensitivity to thermal neutrons and their photons) and some "local" extra uncertainty due for example to strong variations of the radiation field around the nominal location etc.. No account is given in the uncertainty for dose for the material dependence (see c), in principle it can be safely computed once the electronic card material composition is known....).
* Not always the naive expectations about the WORST/BEST location are confirmed by the MonteCarlo (see the pixel for example where some slight inversion exists due to local conditions, by the way "naive" expectations in the ID would give Phi/Dose=constant for a given R). Some extra point has been

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]

An additional safety factor has to be introduced to take into account the uncertainty on the electronics behaviour due to low dose rate effects. It should be 5 on the ionising rate and 1.5 on the neutron rate for bipolar electronics. For CMOS, no safety factor has to be applied. This additional safety factor should not be taken into account if the irradiation tests follow either the US Military Standard 883D 1019.4 [1] or the ESA Basic Specification 22900 [2] standards.

It is the same kind of environment as that encountered in space applications and it has to be treated very seriously.

This note does not intend to give strong technical rules but to give general guidelines and to set-up an ATLAS framework to facilitate the work.

## 2 Problems encountered with components off the shelf (COTS).

The use of COTS is extremely attractive because of the functionality, availability and cost they offer. However the behaviour of these components in a radiation environment is very difficult to predict. Some bipolar transistors do not show any beta degradation until 0.5 or 1 kGy while others have a 75% decrease after 0.05 kGy (eg. 2N3700).

Single event effects generated by charge particles or neutrons (of energy greater than 5 Mev) can be destructive (single event burnout [SEB] or single event gate rupture [SEGR]) in power devices (bipolar or power MOSFET).

According to the space community it is necessary to test any component which will be used. An additional difficulty comes from the fact that there are very large fluctuations from lot to lot and yet there is in general no tracability of the components (there is no information concerning the wafer origin of a given packaged chip). These tests must give total dose figures and also sensitivity to single event effects (in particular to SEB and SEGR which are destructive).

## 3 Proposed rules to be applied.

### Limitation of the amount of electronics in a radiation environment.

Electronics should be installed in a radiation environment only if there are substantial arguments to do so.

### ASICs development.

Either radhard or radtol technologies should be used or, if a standard technology is used, it should be hardened by using special layout techniques (such as edgeless transistor, guarding rings,...). Some of these techniques are being studied by the Radtol project supported by the LHCC. The ATLAS front end electronics co-ordination will make sure everybody has access to them.

### Use of COTS

**Use the power components in derated conditions.**

The use of components in derated conditions (e.g. 50 to 75% of maximum voltage)

increases their resistance to SEB and SEGR or even prevents these phenomena to occur.

**Test all components or modules to be put in radiation environment.**

As mentioned above all parts (or at least a subset of the parts) have to be tested with respect to their behaviour in radiation environment. This radiation environment is the one listed in the last two columns of Table 1, unless the two mentioned tests standards [1,2] are followed.

As these tests require considerable effort (especially neutron irradiation), it is proposed to set-up an inventory list of the chips to be used in ATLAS and to co-ordinate the irradiation tests. A procedure will be made available to store tests results.

### Power supplies.

Most of the sub-detectors are planning to install their power supplies in the cavern in order to save cable length. These power supplies use high power components and high beta bipolar transistors and lateral bipolar transistors which are very sensitive to both neutrons and charged particles. A working group is being set-up in order to find common solutions for all sub-systems.

### Formal reviews.

Formal reviews of electronics systems in radiation environment will be organised before the start of construction.
