###### Abstract

This document gives an updated description of the barrel TRT geometry and material weight, which will be fully included in the ATLAS detector description for release 14.0.X.

keywords: materials, geometry, radiation length, nuclear interaction length, barrel.

## 1 Introduction

The purpose of this study was to complete the old and (in several respects) outdated description of the TRT since 2002. The TRT barrel active region was already accurately described but there have been a lot of changes in the end-flange region. These have induced important changes to the material composition because the updated description describes as accurately as possible the radiation length, nuclear interaction length and weight of the TRT barrel. This note also provides a comparison between estimated and measured weights of the barrel TRT in its SR1 configuration.

All the manifolds (cooling, active gas, ventilation gas) have changed. Most of the stainless steel has been replaced by PEEK. The protection boards, the active boards and the cooling plates have been changed and some components were missing in the previous description. The detector includes now much more copper and G10. The material description previously used for the end-flange region was a pure carbon layer with a modified density.

There are two types of changes in the detector description: geometry (size of the volumes and definition of new volumes) and material (content of the volumes). This note describes the numbers which will have been put in the simulation for the TRT barrel in the software for the release 14.0.X (a big part of the changes have been included in release 12.0.0): it begins with corrections for the barrel services region between the barrel and end-cap; and then it completes the update by introducing two new volumes called inner and outer volumes.

## 2 The geometry

Table 1 shows the different volumes delimitated by their Z coordinates (along the beam axis) and their radii Rin and Rout. The dimensions have been chosen to match the engineering drawings and to provide the best description of the real detector (see also Fig. 1). The dimensions are given for one half of the barrel and the volumes are given for the complete barrel. More information about the dimensions of the detector can be found at [1].

But later on we could need to adjust the position of the modules in the active region (for instance for alignment), so we need to maintain clearances between sub systems. Therefore the geometry dimensions that are used in the simulation are slightly different (see table 2).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|r|r|r|r|r} \hline Volume name & z\({}_{\text{min}}\) (mm) & z\({}_{\text{max}}\) (mm) & R\({}_{\text{in}}\) (mm) & R\({}_{\text{out}}\) (mm) & V (cm\({}^{3}\)) \\ \hline Inner volume & 0.0 & 715.0 & 557.0 & 560.0 & 15054.29 \\ \hline Active region & 0.0 & 715.0 & 560.0 & 1070.0 & 3734596.54 \\ \hline Outer volume & 0.0 & 715.0 & 1070.0 & 1081.1 & 107267.83 \\ \hline End flange region & 715.0 & 765.3 & 550.0 & 1080.0 & 273030.60 \\ \hline Services & 765.3 & 780.0 & 560.0 & 1070.0 & 76781.22 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The weights

To get a precise estimation of the total weight of the barrel, a long study has been done to collect the primary material for all the components of the detector. This included several discussions with the technicians and engineers who designed and built the detector. As often as possible, the actual weight of the components has been used. Otherwise it has been calculated or estimated, for instance using the technical drawings. The result of this study is available at [2]. The file contains some information about the barrel and the end-caps and it successively presents the detailed weight of all the individual parts. The total weight obtained for each volume is listed in table 3 (the weights of the end-flange region and the services are given per side and must therefore be counted twice in the calculation of the total weight of the barrel). The services listed below and considered in this study are those going from the detector to the Patch Panel Boards 1 (PPB1).

This leads to a total weight of M = 702.9 kg for the whole barrel with its services (the total weight obtained from the previous description is about 641 kg). The total uncertainty on this weight is estimated to be about 3.1 kg (not including possible omissions). To get this value we have assigned the following errors to each component of the barrel:

1% in case the weight has been measured (2.6 kg contribution to the total uncertainty)

2% when the weight has been calculated, for instance from a volume (1.4 kg)

5% on the active boards composition (0.7 kg)

20% on the solder, the glue or the guesses (0.7 kg)

4 The radiation and the nuclear interaction lengths

a) Material distribution

From the collection of materials [2], we also have calculated the contribution of the individual items in the radiation (X\({}_{0i}\)) and nuclear interaction (\(\lambda_{0i}\)) lengths inside each volume V, using the formulas:

\[\begin{array}{l}\mbox{X${}_{0i}$ (\%)}=\mbox{M (g) * T (cm) / (V (cm\({}^{3}\)) * X${}_{0i}$ (g/cm\({}^{2}\)))}\\ \mbox{and}\\ \lambda_{0i}$ (\%)}=\mbox{M (g) * T (cm) / (V (cm\({}^{3}\)) * \(\lambda_{0i}\) (g/cm\({}^{2}\)))}\end{array}\]

where M is the weight of the contribution and T the thickness of material considered at normal incidence. Then to get the total equivalent radiation (X0\({}_{\rm eq}\)) and nuclear interaction (\(\lambda\)0\({}_{\rm eq}\)) lengths for each volume, we calculate the sum of the individual contributions, using the formulas [3]:

\[\mbox{X0${}_{\rm eq}$ }^{\mbox{-1}}=\Sigma\mbox{ w${}_{i}$, }\mbox{X${}_{0i}$ }^{\mbox{-1}}\qquad\qquad\mbox{and}\qquad\quad\lambda\mbox{0${}_{\rm eq}$ }^{\mbox{-1}}=\Sigma\mbox{ w${}_{i}$, }\mbox{ }\lambda_{0i}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|} \hline Volume name & Weight (kg) \\ \hline Inner volume & 23.7 \\ \hline Active region & 361.8 \\ \hline Outer volume & 65.6 \\ \hline End-flange region & 113.2 per side \\ \hline Services (until PPB1) & 12.7 per side \\ \hline Total barrel without services & 677.5 \\ \hline Total barrel including services & 702.9 \\ until PPB1 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

where \(\rm w_{i}\) is the weight fraction of the contributions. Note that the active region is described element by element so it is not detailed here (see next section). The results are listed in table 4.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Volume & Weight & Average & Volume & T & X0 & X/X0 & \(\lambda\)0 & \(\lambda\)/\(\lambda\)0 \\ name & (kg) & density \(\rho\) & (cm\({}^{3}\)) & (cm) & (g/cm\({}^{2}\)) & (\%) & (g/cm\({}^{2}\)) & (\%) \\  & & (g/cm\({}^{3}\)) & & & & & \\ \hline Inner & 23.7 & 2.3131 & 10246.01 & 0.205 & 35.39 & 1.34 & 87.81 & 0.54 \\ volume & & & & & & & \\ \hline Outer & 65.6 & 2.8889 & 22707.32 & 0.235 & 32.64 & 2.08 & 90.52 & 0.75 \\ volume & & & & & & & \\ \hline End & 226.4 & 0.8343 & 271364.94 & 5.025 & 23.67 & 17.71 & 99.11 & 4.23 \\ flange & & & & & & & & \\ \hline Services & 25.4 & 0.3814 & 66595.95 & 1.275 & 15.69 & 3.10 & 121.57 & 0.40 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Tab. 4: Total weight, average density, volumes, thickness of material at normal incidence and radiation and nuclear interaction lengths for the TRT barrel volumes.

One interesting number is the equivalent radiation length of the barrel end-flange at normal incidence. Today it is 17.71% to be compared to the previous estimate of 13.26%.

b) Modelled description

Instead of putting all the different components of the volumes in the simulation of the detector, we simplify the description by using up to three different materials, whose combination gives a mixture that has the correct M, X\({}_{0}\) and \(\lambda\)\({}_{0}\). This calculation used the standard material PDG values [3]. To take into account the high number of real materials used in a volume, one sometimes needs to use materials that don't exist in the real detector (H\({}_{2}\)O for instance). All the percentages given below correspond to weight fractions of the mixture (these fractions are the inputs for the simulation and more details about their calculation can be found in [2]). In the same table, we also indicate the modified density of the materials, which will be used to appropriately fill each volume. Note that the exact composition of the G10 used is the following: 21.99 % of Si, 41.72 % of O, 26.82 % of C, 6.60 % of H, 2.87 % of Cl. The modelled description is detailed in table 5. And the last columns allow the reader to check that we perfectly reproduce the same X0, \(\lambda\)0 and average densities as in table 4.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Volume & \multicolumn{4}{c|}{Weight fraction in \%} & \(\rho\) & X0 & \(\lambda\)0 & V \\ name & \multicolumn{4}{c|}{(Modified density in g/cm\({}^{3}\))} & (g/cm\({}^{2}\)) & (g/cm\({}^{2}\)) & (g/cm\({}^{2}\)) & (cm\({}^{3}\)) \\ \cline{2-10}  & Cu & Alu & C & G10 & H\({}_{2}\)O & & & \\ \hline Inner & 6.97 & & 68.57 & & 24.46 & 2.3131 & 35.39 & 87.81 & 10245.92 \\ volume & (8.556) & & (2.163) & & (0.955) & & & \\ \hline Outer & 13.12 & & 84.84 & & 2.04 & 2.8887 & 32.64 & 90.52 & 22709.41 \\ volume & (8.302) & & (2.099) & & (0.927) & & & \\ \hline End & 22.97 & 9.06 & & 67.97 & & 0.8343 & 23.67 & 99.11 & 271371.29 \\ flange & (2.162) & (0.651) & & (0.410) & & & & \\ \hline Services & 62.43 & 33.62 & & 3.95 & & 0.3814 & 15.69 & 121.57 & 66590.10 \\  & (0.520) & (0.157) & & (0.099) & & & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Tab. 5: Weight fractions and modified densities of the materials used for the TRT barrel volumes, with the X0 and \(\lambda\)0 we obtain with the chosen mixture.

In this section, we successively give the detailed weight (obtained in the estimation) of all the components of the active region (see table 6), and afterwards some details about the modules, with a comparison between the estimated weight and some modules weight measurements. Note that in the simulation a few parts have been modelled in the same volume, so they are included in the same volumes in table 6 (radiators, shell and cooling tubes). Moreover the TRT barrel contains 3x32 modules.

Table 6: Detailed weight of the active region.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

Table 8 shows the measured weight of all the modules as they arrived at Cern, and also the number of dead and replaced wires per module [4]. Note that a few modules of the type 3 haven't been weighted, so they are not counted in the total or in the average weight of table 8. Moreover the nominal number of wires per module is 329 for type 1, 520 for type 2 and 793 for type 3, so we have 52544 wires (also called straws) at total for the complete barrel.

In order to see the precision of our description on the active region of the detector, we compare the weight of the modules between the measurements and the estimation (see table 10). To get the estimated weight of a module, we need to take into account all the components that are in the active region, and also all the components related to the high voltage plates, the tension plates, the shell end, the straws end and the ventilation gas from the end-flange region (see table 9).

Then we compare these numbers with the measurements. In table 10, the total weight per type of module for the measurement is calculated from the average weight per module.

The difference on the total weight of the modules is then about 5.25 kg, which is about 1.2 %. And we should keep that in mind for the discussion about the total weight of the TRT barrel (next section).

## 6 Comparison with actual measurements of the barrel TRT weight

The weight of the whole barrel has been measured several times and in different configurations. The comparison between the measurements and the estimation is done in the configuration where the TRT barrel has all the new manifolds installed, no services and no cooling fluid (we will call it config.1).

Two measurements have been done with a load cell lifting each of the 4 support points individually. This was repeated three times. The precision of the initial calibration is about \(\pm\) 10 kg on the individual measurement, and therefore assumed to be about \(\pm\) 20 kg for the total. Here are the details:- First measurement, during the barrel transfer to the ID trolley (16.11.05, see [http://perneg.home.cern.ch/perneg/SR/Sr171105/html/](http://perneg.home.cern.ch/perneg/SR/Sr171105/html/), [5]):

M = 714 kg for the barrel equipped with 2 stainless steel cooling manifolds on each side (including their cooling fluid) and one stainless steel active gas manifold for side A. In addition there was 2 plexiglas plates covering the inner volume of the TRT barrel and 4 aluminium bars to hold the plates on the rails.

To get the weight of the complete barrel without services (in config.1), we need to adjust a few numbers to take into account the configuration of the detector during the measurement. The stainless steel manifolds needed to be removed before replacement (- 3.1 kg) as well as the cooling fluid for 2 manifolds (- 0.7 kg). The new active gas manifolds (+ 7.9 kg) and the cooling manifolds (+ 5.6 kg) were not yet installed. Furthermore we need to subtract the weight of the plexiglas plates (- 15.2 kg) and of the Al bars (- 2.0 kg). Then the total estimated weight of the TRT barrel in config. 1 is M = 706.5 kg.

- Second measurement, before the insertion of the SCT (16.02.06, see [http://perneg.home.cern.ch/perneg/SR/Sr170206/html/gr5z5122.htm](http://perneg.home.cern.ch/perneg/SR/Sr170206/html/gr5z5122.htm)):

M = 699.5 kg for the barrel equipped with 4 active gas and cooling peek manifolds on each side (no cooling fluid) and the services were installed for 2 sectors.

If we add the weight of the active gas manifolds missing (+ 6 kg) and the cooling manifolds missing (+ 4.2 kg), and subtract the weight of the cables (- 1.6 kg), we get a second estimate of M = 708.1 kg (in config. 1).

The uncertainty on these 2 measurements is relatively high because of two main reasons. The first one could be due to several cables from the top sectors that have been weighted during the second measurement, even if we strongly believe that these cables were hold by the structure around the barrel and thus didn't contribute to the weight. The second reason is that the calibration of the sensors was poor. So we could expect that these 2 values are known with an accuracy of \(\pm\) 20 kg. The average weight of the barrel TRT is then \(707.3\pm 20\) kg.

The corresponding estimated weight (in config.1) that can be obtained from the section 3 of this note is 677.5 kg minus 11.9 kg (the cooling) i.e. 665.6 kg, which is somewhat below the values we get from the two measurements. This means a difference of about 6 % (including about 1.2 % of uncertainty coming from the modules).

## 7 Other measurements of the TRT + SCT barrels weight

A measurement of the TRT + SCT barrels has been done after the SCT barrel insertion (08.06). The total weight was M = 886 kg. This is one of the last measurements done in SR1 and the aim was to get an estimation of the SCT barrel weight, since no measurement of its weight has been done before. During the insertion of the SCT, the total weight of the assembly has increased by 201 kg, and this is probably the best measurement we could ever get for the SCT barrel alone. If we deduce this value from the total, we get a TRT barrel weight of 685 kg, which only indicates a lower weight as obtained previously (and 2.8 % above the estimation).

Two other measurements of the TRT and the SCT barrels have been done in the pit. The total weight was 897 kg and 884 kg, but from these values we need to deduce the weight of 4 Plexiglas plates per side, whose total weight is about 9.5 kg. This leads to a total weight of 887.5 kg and 874.5 kg. So, the average weight of the TRT + SCT barrels is \(882.7\pm 20\) kg. And if we deduce the proposed weight of the SCT, we get a weight of 681.7 \(\pm\) 20 kg for the TRT barrel alone, which is 2.4 % above the estimation.

We have started to explain the sources of the differences but here are a few comments. First the estimated weight is not including possible omissions and was trying to take into account some complicated contributions such as glue or solder, so this is probably a bottom-up estimate. Second, it was difficult to measure the total weight of the TRT barrel with a high precision. Moreover, as you have seen it was also difficult to know exactly the status of the detector during the measurement because it was always under construction and tests. So the materials that have been put in the simulation correspond to the estimation given in this note. And later on, the material description will be updated according to the first physics analyses.
