Study of the double Higgs production channel \(H(\to\)\(b\bar{b})H(\to\gamma\gamma)\) with the ATLAS experiment at the HL-LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note presents the prospects for a measurement to observe di-Higgs production decaying to \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\). This study is carried out in the context of the high luminosity LHC using an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)and mean pileup rates \(<\mu>\) of 200. This analysis is based on generator-level information. The energy and momentum of the produced particles are smeared to simulate the response of the upgraded ATLAS detector and pile-up collisions. An expected significance of \(1.05\sigma\) is found for this channel. Neglecting systematic uncertainties, the Higgs boson self-coupling would be constrained to \(-0.8<\lambda/\lambda_{SM}<7.7\) at 95% confidence level.

The ATLAS Collaboration

## 1 Introduction

In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations reported the observation of a new particle with Higgs-boson-like properties [1; 2]. The current best measurement of the mass of this boson, which is based on the Run-1 data taken by both experiments, is \(m_{H}=125.09\pm 0.21(\mathrm{stat.})\pm 0.11(\mathrm{syst.})\) GeV [3]. The properties of the new particle, including its spin, CP properties, and coupling strengths to SM particles, are found to be consistent with those expected for the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson [4]. Other properties of the Higgs boson, such as for example the Higgs self-coupling, cannot be extracted from the Run-1 data. Even with the large data sets expected at the High Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC), measurements of the Higgs self-coupling are expected to be extremely challenging. A direct measurement of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling \(\lambda_{HHH}\) requires the study of Higgs boson pair production. For a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, the production cross section of pairs of 125 GeV Higgs bosons is estimated to be 39.6 fb (with an uncertainty of \({}^{-6.0}_{+4.4}\%\) from QCD scale uncertainties and \(\pm 2.1\%\) and 2.2% from the parton distribution function (PDF) and \(\alpha_{S}\) uncertainties) [5].

One of the most promising channels to measure the Higgs self-coupling is the \(H(\to b\bar{b})H(\to\gamma\gamma)\) final state, which is studied in this note. This channel profits from a clean \(HH\) signal extraction thanks to the narrow mass peak of the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay. As the low branching ratio (0.13 %) for this decay leads to low expected signal rates, only the gluon-gluon production mode is studied.

The analysis is carried out in the context of the HL-LHC with an upgraded ATLAS detector. The study is based on \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. To emulate the detector response, the final-state particles at truth level are smeared according to the expected detector resolutions assuming a pile-up scenario with 200 overlapping events (\(<\mu>=200\)) [6]. In addition, the expected efficiencies and fake rates for identifying \(b\)-jets and photons are used. These smearing functions were obtained from fully simulated samples using a recent detector layout described as the'reference scenario' in the ATLAS Scoping Document [7].

A first prospective analysis has been released by ATLAS [8] in a simplified scenario. Compared to the previous analysis, this study uses the latest layout of the upgraded ATLAS detector, considers a higher value for \(<\mu>\), introduces jets from pile-up, uses slightly different event selection criteria, and takes into account some background processes which were previously neglected.

## 2 Background and signal simulation

Monte Carlo simulation samples are used to model the expected signal and background processes. The main backgrounds arise from processes with multiple jets and photons that lead to two identified photons and two \(b\)-jets in the final state. These backgrounds can be separated into background with a single Higgs boson in the final state and the continuum background. The latter comprises background containing multiple jet and photon production, which are \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\), \(c\bar{c}\gamma\gamma\), \(jj\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}\,jj\gamma\), \(c\bar{c}j\gamma\), and \(b\bar{b}jj\) events. Other contributions arise from \(Z(b\bar{b})\gamma\gamma\), \(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) production. The list of signal and background samples considered is displayed in Table 1.

For the signal process \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\), only the dominant gluon-gluon fusion production mode is generated using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[9; 10; 11] at leading order (LO) (with finite top mass) with Pythia 8[12] to model parton showering and hadronisation. The A14 tune [13] is used together with the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set [14]. The event yields are normalised to the next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) cross-sectionsof Refs. [15] and [16] (using the infinite top mass approximation). Events were produced with four different self-coupling strengths: \(\lambda_{HHH}=0\) corresponding to the case of no Higgs self interaction, \(\lambda_{HHH}=\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\) corresponding to the SM expection, and \(\lambda_{HHH}=2(10)\times\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\) corresponding to a value twice (ten times) that of the SM. In the following, the ratio \(\lambda_{HHH}/\lambda_{HHH}^{SM}\) will be referred to simply as \(\lambda/\lambda^{SM}\), and unless otherwise stated, the signal sample referred to in the text is that with \(\lambda/\lambda^{SM}=1\). There is no resonance like a heavy scalar or graviton that the process goes through, just the quark box or an off-shell Higgs boson.

The background for single Higgs boson production via gluon-gluon fusion is generated using PowhegBox [17]. This process uses the CT10 PDF set [18] and is interfaced to Pythia 6[19] for parton showering and hadronisation. The cross section is normalised to next-to-next-to-next-leading order in QCD predictions [5]. The associated Higgs production modes \(ZH(\to\gamma\gamma)\), \(t\bar{t}H(\to\gamma\gamma)\), and \(b\bar{b}H(\to\gamma\gamma)\) samples are generated using Pythia 8. The \(ZH(\to\gamma\gamma)\) process is normalised to cross-sections calculated at NNLO in QCD [20] with NLO EW corrections [21]. The \(t\bar{t}H(\to\gamma\gamma)\) process is normalised to a calculation at NLO in QCD [22, 23, 24, 25] and the \(b\bar{b}H(\to\gamma\gamma)\) process is normalised to a calculation at NNLO in QCD with a next-next-to-leading-log (NNLL) accuracy [26].

Non-resonant background arises from the processes \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\), \(c\bar{c}\gamma\gamma\), \(jj\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}\,jj\), \(c\bar{c}\,j\gamma\), \(Z(\to b\bar{b})\gamma\gamma\), and \(b\bar{b}jj\), where the jets in the last process come both from light quarks or gluons. In the \(jj\gamma\gamma\) sample, the jets arise either both from light quark or \(bjj\gamma\gamma\), \(cj\gamma\gamma\), or \(bc\gamma\gamma\). These processes are produced with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO interfaced with Pythia 8 for the showering and hadronisation. The CTEQ6L1 PDF [27] set is used. These samples were generated inclusively (e.g. an additional jet in the tree-level matrix element is allowed). The jets and photons produced in the hard process are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) and \(25\) respectively and the photon rapidity is limited to \(|\eta|<2.7\). The invariant mass of two jets has to exceed \(25\). In addition, for processes with two photons produced in the hard process, the di-photon invariant mass is restricted to \(60<m_{\gamma\gamma}<200\) and for processes with two \(b\)-quarks, the invariant mass of the \(b\bar{b}\) system has to exceed \(45\).

Backgrounds from \(t\bar{t}\) production are estimated at NLO in QCD using Powheg-Box, which is interfaced to Pythia 6 for parton showering and hadronisation. The CT10 PDF set [18] is used for this process. The events are filtered to contain at least one lepton in the final state. The cross section is calculated with the Top++2.0 program to NNLO in QCD, including soft-gluon resummation to NNLL (see Ref. [28] and references therein), and assuming a top-quark mass \(m_{top}=172.5\). The main background from \(t\bar{t}\) production comes from the production with one photon in the final state. Therefore, a \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) sample was also produced in LO, using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO interfaced with Pythia 8 for the showering and hadronisation and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set. The cross section is normalised to the NLO predictions [29].

Overlaps between the different samples are taken into account at analysis level, for example \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) events are vetoed in the \(b\bar{b}j\gamma\) samples and \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) events in the \(t\bar{t}\) sample.

## 3 Object definition

Most of the reconstructed particles have a similar definition as in the previous note [8], where the final-state particles at truth level are smeared according to the expected detector resolutions. The impact of 200 pile-up events on average is included in the reconstruction efficiency of the objects.

The photon efficiencies, resolutions and fake rates were computed from simulations based on the detector layout presented in the Scoping Document and documented in Ref. [30]. In this analysis, the efficiency used to identify isolated photons is around 50% at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=50\GeV\) and saturates at 85% above 150. The corresponding probability for a jet emerging from the primary interaction to be mis-identified as a photon is at most \(5\times 10^{-4}\). The probability that an electron fakes a photon is assumed to be 2% (5%) in the barrel (endcap) region.

To reconstruct jets, the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [31] with a distance parameter of 0.4 is used. One main change with respect to the previous analysis is the emulation of additional jets coming from pile-up. The mean number of such pile-up jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) is 5.5 (\(<\mu>\)=200) per event. Most of these jets can be rejected using tracking information by looking at the ratio of the scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) sum of the tracks that are associated with the jet and originate from the hard-scatter vertex divided by the fully calibrated jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (including pile-up subtraction). Small ratios typically arise from pile-up jets, while the ratio is larger for jets from the primary interaction. This method is applied to jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<100\GeV\), as the probability that a high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jet is arising from pile-up is very small. Using this method, a working point with a typical rejection factor (dependent on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\)) of 50 for pile-up jets is used. This results on average in 0.14 pile-up jets per event. More details on this method, which in the following is referred to as track confirmation, is given in Ref. [7].

The \(b\)-tagging efficiency and mistag rates have also been updated with the most recent Inner Tracker layout, which is documented in the Technical Design Report for the ITK Strip Detector [32]. The \(b\)-tagging working point of 70% \(b\)-jet identification efficiency was chosen. The \(b\)-tagging performance for the reconstructed jets is modelled by applying a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) dependent efficiency or mistag rate function.

In addition, the cross section times branching ratio, the order in QCD of the cross-section calculation used, and the equivalent luminosity of the sample are given.

To derive the efficiency for \(b\)-tagging a jet, the response of the ATLAS MV1 \(b\)-tagging algorithm [33], mixed with the track confirmation algorithm, was computed using fully simulated events. A typical rejection factor of 1300 for jets not containing any heavy flavour hadrons, 8 for \(c\)-jets, and 1350 for pile-up jets is obtained. The transverse energy of the \(b\)-jets is corrected for differences between parton and reconstruction levels.

## 4 Event Selection

To select \(H(b\bar{b})H(\gamma\gamma)\) events, the following event selection cuts, summarised in Table 2, are applied. Only events accepted by the di-photon trigger, which requires each photon to have a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) greater than 25 GeV within \(|\eta|<2.5\) are considered. Offline, the two photons should have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV and be within the acceptance of the electromagnetic calorimeter but excluding the region between the barrel and endcap calorimeter, in which the performance is poor (\(|\eta|<1.37\) or \(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\)). To ensure the photons are isolated, each photon is required to be separated by \(\Delta R_{\gamma\gamma}=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}\times\Delta\phi^{2}}>0.4\) from other photons and by \(\Delta R_{\gamma jet}>0.4\) from jets found in the event. Furthermore, \(\Delta R_{\gamma\gamma}\) has to be below 2.0 due to the boost of the photons from the Higgs boson. The two-photon system should fulfil \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>80\) GeV and have an invariant mass within \(122<m_{\gamma\gamma}<128\) GeV. In addition, events including isolated electrons and muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV within \(|\eta|<2.5\) are rejected.

Events are required to contain no more than five jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). At least two of these jets must be b-tagged within \(|\eta|<2.4\). The leading \(b\)-jet is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\) GeV and the subleading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) has to exceed 30 GeV. The \(b\bar{b}\) system must have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>80\) GeV, \(100<m_{b\bar{b}}<150\) GeV and is required to fulfil \(0.4<\Delta R_{b\bar{b}}<2.0\).

In the following, the events passing the above selection criteria are split into two categories depending on the photon pseudorapidities. If both photons are located in the barrel region of the electromagnetic calorimeter (\(|\eta|<1.37\)), the event is flagged as 'barrel-barrel'. Otherwise, it is labelled as 'other'.

The sources of jets identified as \(b\)-jets and reconstructed photons are displayed in Figure 1 for the background. It demonstrates that the two jets tagged as \(b\)-jets in the analysis come predominantly from genuine \(b\)-jets. This is followed by events in which one or both of the \(b\)-tagged jets arise from \(c\)-jets. It is less likely that at least one of the \(b\)-tagged jets originates from a pile-up or light jet. Most of the photon pairs come from genuine photons at generator level. For other photon pairs, one of the photons was misidentified and most likely comes from either a light jet, a pile-up jet or an electron.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|} \hline Event Selection Criteria \\ \hline \hline \(\geq 2\) isolated photons, with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV, \(|\eta|<1.37\) or \(1.52<|\eta|<2.37\) \\ \hline \(\geq 2\) jets identified as \(b\)-jets with leading/subleading \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40/30\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.4\) \\ \hline \(<6\) jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline No isolated leptons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline \(0.4<\Delta R_{b\bar{b}}<2.0,0.4<\Delta R_{\gamma\gamma}<2.0,0.4<\Delta R_{ \gamma jet}\) \\ \hline \(122<m_{\gamma\gamma}<128\) GeV, \(100<m_{h\bar{b}}<150\) GeV \\ \hline \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma\gamma}\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{b\bar{b}}>80\) GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The sources considered are \(b\)-jets (b), \(c\)-jets (c), jets arising from light quarks (light) or from pile-up (pu). Photon fakes can arise from fake jets from different jet sources, and misidentified electrons (el).

## 5 Results

Following the selection procedure described in the previous section, the expected numbers of signal and background events, normalised to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), are estimated using simulated events. To fully exploit the MC samples and minimise the fluctuations from the smearing functions, two statistical approaches were implemented. The first one is to apply many times the smearing functions on the true particles with different seeds on the same events and compute the mean selection efficiency. This method is simple to implement but is limited for backgrounds with large cross-sections and large rejection rates (\(b\bar{b}jj\) for example). To bypass this limitation, a weighting procedure was developed. Within each event, the different possible final states derived from truth particles are determined and evaluated. A final state probability is the product of its object probabilities. For final states passing event cuts, their probabilities are summed to compute the selection efficiency. The limitation of this method is the possibility to have events with large combinatorics and hence large computing memory usage. This second method was validated against the first one for most of the channels and was applied to the \(b\bar{b}jj\) sample which would have required too many iterations in the first method.

To estimate the statistical uncertainty originating from the limited number of generated events, each of the MC samples is subdivided into subsamples. This uncertainty is computed from the RMS of the mean value from each subsample divided by the square root of the number of subsamples.

Table 4 lists, for each diphoton category, the expected number of events for signal and each background channel, the total background and the significance. The significance is calculated as \(S/\sqrt{B}\), where \(S\) is the signal yield and \(B\) the background yield. Combining the two categories, the expected number of signal events is 9.544 \(\pm\) 0.029 and 90.9 \(\pm\) 2.0 events for the background. Splitting the events into two categories improves the significance by 5% and leads to an expected sensitivity of 1.052 with a statistical uncertainty from the finite size of the MC samples of 0.026. To estimate roughly the equivalent of the combined results in this channel from both ATLAS and CMS, 6000 fb\({}^{-1}\)of data can be assumed. This yields a significance of 1.49 \(\pm\) 0.05. The invariant mass distributions of the dijet and diphoton pairs are shown in Figure 2. The dominant backgrounds are \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) and \(b\bar{b}j\gamma\) final states. Other processes that also contribute significantly to the total expected background include \(ZH(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma)\), \(\bar{t}H(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\gamma)\), \(c\bar{c}\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}jj\), and \(t\bar{t}\gamma\). When HL-LHC data will be available, the non-resonant background will be precisely estimated applying the side-band method on the diphoton mass distribution as used in the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) Run-2 analysis [34]. As a test,

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline
**Selection requirement** & **Efficiency (\%)** \\ \hline trigger + \(\geq\) 2 tight photons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) \(>\) 25 GeV & 32.0 \\ \hline \(\geq\) 2 photon candidates with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) \(>\) 30 GeV & 27.4 \\ \hline \(\geq\) 2 jet candidates & 21.7 \\ \hline \(\geq\) 2 \(b\)-jet candidates & 7.73 \\ \hline \(<\) 6 jet candidates & 7.46 \\ \hline isolated lepton veto & 6.96 \\ \hline \(0.4<\Delta R_{b\bar{b}}<2.0,\Delta R_{\gamma\gamma}<2.0\) & 5.25 \\ \hline \(122<m_{\gamma\gamma}<128\) GeV & 3.95 \\ \hline \(100<m_{b\bar{b}}<150\) GeV & 2.90 \\ \hline H candidates \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>80\) GeV & 2.89 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Cut flow for the signal process \(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\) with an average pile-up of \(<\mu>\)=200.

a simpler version of this method was applied to the current MC samples and, normalised to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), a 5% statistical uncertainty on the sum of all non-resonant backgrounds was obtained. Using the current theoretical uncertainties on the QCD scale, \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) and PDF uncertainties, the background uncertainty from single Higgs boson production is 8%. The single Higgs boson production amounts to 17% of the total background in the signal region and therefore the associated uncertainty of the significance is of the order of one percent.

## 6 Limit setting for non-BSM couplings

In this section, the sensitivity from BSM models which modify the di-Higgs couplings is studied. Variations in the Higgs boson self-coupling, \(\lambda\), change the total cross-section of the non-resonant \(HH\) production. There is also a smaller effect arising from the change in the number of di-Higgs events passing the signal selection as a function of \(\lambda\) due to kinematical effects. The changes in the expected number of events for different values of \(\lambda\) w.r.t. the SM couplings \(\lambda_{SM}\) were estimated using the morphing technique documented in Ref. [35] for \(-20<\lambda/\lambda_{SM}<20\). This allows to set upper limits on the cross-section as a function of \(\lambda/\lambda_{SM}\) in the pseudo-dataset corresponding to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), neglecting the effect of systematic uncertainties, using the CLs technique [36]. The thus obtained cross-section limit (dashed line) together with the \(\pm 1\sigma\) and \(\pm 2\sigma\) uncertainty bands is shown in Figure 3. Also shown is the parameterisation of the predicted cross section (red line). The minimum of this curve is displaced with respect to zero due to the dependence of the cross-section coming from the mixture of box and self-coupling diagrams, including interference effects, and the effects of the analysis selection. The exclusion limits grow worse in the range

In the last two rows the significance per category and the combined significance are displayed.

\(3<\lambda/\lambda_{SM}<5\) as the number of expected \(HH\) events skews to lower values where the cross section is decreased. If systematic uncertainties are neglected, the Higgs boson self-coupling is expected to be constrained at 95% CL to \(-0.8<\lambda/\lambda_{SM}<7.7\). Limits can further be improved by analysing the shape of the \(HH\) mass distribution. The current limits are a bit less stringent than in the analysis of \(HH\to 4b\)[37], which is quoting expected limits of \(0.2<\lambda/\lambda_{SM}<7.0\).

## 7 Conclusion

This note presents preliminary studies of a search for pair production of SM Higgs bosons decaying into two photons and two \(b\)-jets in the high luminosity LHC context. The expected number of signal and background events have been estimated from simulated truth level information after applying smearing functions to mimic the ATLAS detector response in the HL-LHC environment.

Using a cut-based analysis the estimated number of signal events is 9.544 \(\pm\) 0.029, to be compared to a background level of 90.9 \(\pm\) 2.0 events. The combination of these numbers gives an expected significance of 1.05\(\sigma\) for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). At 95% CL, the Higgs boson self-coupling is expected to be constrained to \(-0.8<\lambda/\lambda_{SM}<7.7\). This is not enough on its own to claim evidence for the observation of Higgs pair production, or to determine whether the Higgs self-coupling strength is close to its SM expectation. This channel is expected to be combined with similar measurements for di-Higgs boson production in other decay channels such as \(HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) and \(HH\to b\bar{b}\tau\tau\) and to be part of a combination of ATLAS and CMS results.

Figure 3: Expected 95% CL upper limit on the cross-section \(\sigma(HH\to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma)\) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data and neglecting systematic uncertainties, as a function of the Higgs self-coupling constant \(\lambda\) in units of \(\lambda_{SM}\). The \(\pm 1\sigma\) and \(\pm 2\sigma\) uncertainty bands are shown in green and yellow. The cross-section exclusion limit grows less stringent in the range \(3<\lambda/\lambda_{SM}<5\) due to the shift of the number of expected \(HH\) events towards lower values where the cross section is decreased.
