**Abstract**

A study of the decay channel H/A \(\rightarrow\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\)\(\rightarrow\)_bl\(\nu\)bjj_ is presented, where H/A are the neutral Higgs bosons predicted by the MSSM model. PYTHIA 5.7[1] has been used to generate the signal and a background, consisting of the continuum spectrum of W + jets and t\(\overline{\rm t}\) events. The detector simulation has been performed with the fast simulation package ATLFAST 2.14[2]. This simulation includes reconstruction and identifying of b-jets, which play an important role in the analysis. About 4500 (3200) signal over 34200 (52900) background events from t\(\overline{\rm t}\) continuum production are expected after reconstruction in the mass window of 26 GeV (40 GeV) for \(m_{\,H/A}\) = 370 GeV (450 GeV) respectively. It is shown that a signal peak from H/A can be subtracted from the continuum background, in the low tan\(\beta\) region (tan\(\beta\sim 1.5\)) for an integrated luminosity of 3 10\({}^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) and for Higgs mass in the range 350-500 GeV.

**1. Introduction**

The H/A \(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) channel has been proposed in [3][4] as one of the interesting channels to search for the MSSM Higgs.

In the context of the Standard Model (SM), the H \(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) branching ratio is too small (\(\sim 10\%\)) to be observable. In the MSSM case, however, the H \(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) and A \(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) couplings are strangly enhanced in some region of parameter space leading to branching ratio close to 100% for \(m_{H}\),\(m_{A}\geq 2m_{t}\) and tan\(\beta\sim 1\)[3]. The H \(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) and A \(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) production and decays cannot be distinguished experimentally one from each other, since the H and A bosons are almost degenerate in mass in the relevant region of the space parameters.

The strategy used to identify t\(\overline{\rm t}\) decays from H/A consists in searching for WWb\(\overline{\rm b}\) final states. One top decay, t \(\to\) Wb, is required to be followed by the semileptonic decay of the W-boson, W \(\to l\nu\), giving isolated lepton to trigger experiment. The second W-boson is required to decay hadronically, W \(\to\) jj. This situation provides a final state topology with one isolated lepton and four reconstructed jets originating from b-quarks and from hadronic W decay (W \(\to\)jj). The Higgs signal would thus appear in the invariant t\(\overline{\rm t}\) mass distribution, hopefully as a peak over the continuum background.

The various background processes can be divided into two categories:

\(\bullet\) the irreducible background, consisting of the t\(\overline{\rm t}\)\(\to\)_bl\(\nu\)bjj_ continuum channel;

\(\bullet\) the reducible background contaning multi-jet final state, such as W + jets production with W \(\to l\nu\).

This paper discusses the observability of the H/A \(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) channel with two b-tagged jets. The assumed efficiency for b-jets identification is \(\varepsilon_{b}=60\%\) (\(50\%\)) at low (high) luminosity with \(\varepsilon_{c}=10\%\) and \(\varepsilon_{j}=1\%\) respectively [5]. The lepton was required to have \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}\)\(>20\) GeV for electrons and \(p_{T}\)\(>6\) GeV for muons at low luminosity. For all the jets, those from W-decay and the two b-jets, \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}\)\(>4\,0\) GeV were required. It was assumed that the experiment could trigger on such topologies (eg. with single lepton trigger) and efficiently reconstruct them at low and high luminosities. For high luminosity the threshold for trigger electrons has to be raised to 30 GeV, while the 20 GeV threshold can be kept for muons [6].

Section 2 briefly discuss cross-section for signal and background events as well as the acceptance of initial selection. Section 3 describes the two reconstruction procedures, as well as present final results for the MSSM H/A\(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) observability. Section 4 reports the difference between them. Section 5 is devoted on signal+background fit procedure. In section 6 the conclusions are given.

## 2. Observability of the H/A \(\rightarrow\) tt channel with two b-tagged jets

Higgs boson (H/A) signal production at LHC is dominated by the _gg_ fusion processes[4]. The matrix elements for these processes are implemented in PYTHIA 5.7 Monte Carlo. The cross sections given by PYTHIA for \(m_{H/A}\) = 370, 400 and 450 GeV, with \(m_{top}\) = 175 GeV and using CTEQ2L structure function, are shown in Table 1.

The continuum tt production gives rise to tt \(\rightarrow\)_bl\(\nu\)bjj_ events which are expected to be the main background to the H/A boson signal. At LHC this production is dominated by the _gg_ fusion and _q\(\overline{q}\)_ annihilation and has a large cross-section (see Table 2).

(W \(\rightarrow\)_l\(\nu\)_) + jets production at LHC has a relatively large cross section dominated by _qg \(\rightarrow\) Wq_ and _q\(\overline{q}\)\(\rightarrow\) Wg_ processes (Table 3).

For the analysis presented in this note, the generated signal and background events are passed through the fast simulation of the ATLAS detector in the following way:\(\bullet\) the fast simulation package ATLFAST reconstructs jets and isolated leptons with the energy resolutions and acceptances expected for ATLAS. Hadronic jets are labelled as true b-jets or c-jets if they are within the b-tagging acceptance of the Inner Detector, \(|\eta|<2.5\), and if they are associated to a parent c-quark or b-quark, with \(p_{T}>5\) GeV after FSR:

\(\bullet\) the over ATLAS b-tagging performance is emulated in an approximate manner by randomly tagging b-labelled jets with a probability of 60% (50%) at low (high) luminosity and randomly mistagging c-jets with 10% and other jets with 1% probability;

\(\bullet\) jet energies are rescaled [7] on average to the original parton energies using \(p_{T}\)-dependent scaling factors determined separately for b-jets and non-b-jets. After this procedure has been applied, eg. the peak positions of the invariant mass distributions for jj pairs from \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\mathrm{jj}\) decays are at the correct values within \(\pm\) 1%.

After the selection cuts are applied, the background from continuum \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) is much larger than the one coming from \(\mathrm{W}\) + jets events, and is unfortunately also much larger than the signal. As it was already discussed in [3] after requiring top-pair reconstruction the background from non-\(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) sources (QCD jets, W+jets, etc) can be neglected. In Table 4, the statistics generated for each channel and the total acceptances of the initial selection cuts for low and high threshold are shown.

## 3 Extraction of the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) signal with perfect b-tagging

This section discusses the single and double top-quark reconstruction, as expected with ATLAS detector for inclusive \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events.

The initial selection requires at least 4 reconstructed jets with \(p_{T}\)\(>40\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), two of them being labelled as b-jets and at least one reconstructed isolated lepton with \(p_{T}\)\(>6\) (20) GeV for muons and \(p_{T}\)\(>20\) (30) GeV for electrons and \(|\eta|<2.5\) at low (high) luminosity. The total acceptance of this selection for inclusive \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) events

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Channel & \# generated & Statistical & Acceptances & Acceptances \\  & events & weight & (without pile-up) & (with pile-up) \\  & & & low threshold & high threshold \\ \hline H/A 370 (GeV) & 200k & 0.6 & 12.8 \% & 11.3 \% \\ \hline H/A 400 (GeV) & 200k & 0.4 & 12.1\% & 10.6\% \\ \hline H/A 450 (GeV) & 200k & 0.25 & 11.5\% & 10.1\% \\ \hline \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) & 200k & 12.5 & 17.5\% & 15.1\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

is about 12% and 10.5%, for signal events with \(m_{\,H/A}=370\), 400 and 450 GeV, one W \(\rightarrow\)\(l\nu\) and low and high threshold.

Several algorithms for reconstructing the invariant mass of the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) pair have been studied, in order to understand how to minimise the combinatorial background. We have compared two algorithms [8],[9]:

\(\bullet\) First, where all possible combination of b-jet pairs contribute to the \(m_{\,tt}\) mass distribution;

\(\bullet\) Second, which selects the b-jets giving the best value of \(\chi^{2}=\left(m_{\,k\nu}-m_{\,t}\right)^{2}+\left(m_{\,jjb}-m_{\,t}\right)^{2}\).

### First Algorithm

#### 3.1.1 Single top-quark reconstruction in the hadronic channel

In this case all possible jj combinations are examined; the distribution of their invariant mass \(m_{\,jj}\) is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the ingredients used in the event generation. The signal coming from W \(\rightarrow\) jj decays is clearly visible above the combinatorial background and the expected resolution increases from \(\sigma_{m}=5.5\) GeV (only hard scattering process) to \(\sigma_{m}=10\) GeV (initial and final state radiation and hadronisation/decays included). The distributions for the selected events and for the signal and background are shown in Fig.2. All jj combinations with \(m_{\,jj}=m_{\,W}\pm 20\) GeV (\(\pm\) 2\(\sigma_{m}\) mass window) are retained for the further analysis. In 70% of the events at least one of such combination is found. Using Fig. 2, one can define the side-bands around \(m_{\,W}\) (\(m_{\,W}\)=40-60 GeV, and \(m_{\,W}\)=100-120 GeV) to estimate the combinatorial background;

\(\bullet\) for each accepted jj pair, the two possible jj combinations are considered (two b-tagged jets required);

\(\bullet\) for the jj combinations chosen, the 4-momenta are rescaled to impose the constraint \(m_{\,jj}=m_{\,W}\);

\(\bullet\) finally, \(m_{\,jjb}\) is computed for each of the top-quark candidates.

If jjb combination satisfy the cut \(m_{\,jjb}=m_{\,top}\pm 30\) GeV, the event is accepted for further analysis.

The resulting invariant mass distributions for all valid jjb combinations are shown in Fig. 3. The peak is well centered around \(m_{\,top}\) and the side-bands background reproduce quite accurately the shape and magnitude of the combinatorial background.

Fig. 4 shows the jjb invariant-mass peak after background subtraction, both for 400 and 450 GeV signal and \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) continuum background events, for an integrated luminosity of \(3\,10^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\). The expected resolution is \(\sigma_{m}=9\) GeV (initial and final state radiation and hadronisation/decays included) with 13% of the events falling outside the \(\pm 2\sigma\) mass window. The peak is almost Gaussian and well centered around \(m_{top}\)Figure 1: _Distribution of reconstructed invariant mass for jet pairs, \(m_{jj}\), as a function of the ingredients used in the event generation: hard scattering process (top left), + initial state radiation (top right), + final state radiation (bottom left) and + hadronisation/decays (bottom right)._

Hadronisation/decays in the event generation has been used._

The distribution of \(m_{jj}\) for all combinations (solid) and combinations selected as optimal ones for the t \(\rightarrow\) jjb reconstruction (dashed) are shown on Fig. 5.

#### 3.1.2 Single top-quark reconstruction in the semileptonic channel

The reconstruction of W \(\rightarrow\) l\(\nu\) decays is limited by the impossibility of reconstructing the neutrino four-momentum. The transverse components of the neutrino momentum (\(p_{x}^{\nu}\), \(p_{y}^{\nu}\)) are recovered from the components of the missing energy (\(p_{x}^{miss}\), \(p_{y}^{miss}\)) in the event, while the information on the longitudinal component (\(p_{z}^{\nu}\)) is lost because of the large amount of energy escaping down the beampipe. The component \(p_{z}^{\nu}\) can be extracted solving the equation (1) for the mass of the W-boson, which requires the reconstructed neutrino and lepton system to form the W-mass.

\[m_{W}^{2}=(E^{\nu}+E^{\prime})^{2}-(p_{x}^{\nu}+p_{x}^{l})^{2}-(p_{y}^{\nu}+p_{ y}^{l})^{2}-(p_{z}^{\nu}+p_{z}^{l})^{2} \tag{1}\]

where \(p_{x}^{\nu}\) = \(p_{x}^{miss}\), \(p_{y}^{\nu}\) = \(p_{y}^{miss}\) and the neutrino is assumed massless. The \(m_{l\nu}\) distribution is a delta-type peak and the effect of the natural width of the W-boson is ignored in this approach. The W-mass equation can have one or two solutions and in case two solutions exist both are taken for the further analysis.

Finally, we compute two possible \(m_{\not{W}\nu}\) combinations. If exists the bl\(\nu\) combination satisfying the cut \(m_{bl\nu}\) = \(m_{top}\)\(\pm\) 30 GeV, the event is accepted for further analysis.

The resulting invariant mass distributions for all valid b\(l\nu\) combinations are shown in Fig. 6. The peaks are well centered around \(m_{top}\) and the shape and magnitude of the j\(l\nu\) (where \(j\) is a light jet) background is reproduced.

The light shaded area represents the \(jl\nu\) background (where \(j\) is a light jet)._

Fig. 7 shows the b\(l\nu\) invariant-mass peak after background subtraction, both for the 400 and 450 GeV signal and t\(\overline{\rm t}\) background events, for an integrated luminosity of 3 10\({}^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\). The expected resolution is \(\sigma_{m}=\) 16 GeV with 12% of the events falling outside the \(\pm 2\sigma_{m}\) mass window. The mass resolution is worse for the \(t\to l\nu\,b\) decays (\(\sim\) 16 GeV) than for the \(t\to bjj\) decays (\(\sim\) 10 GeV), because of the poor accuracy on the extraction of the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino.

#### 3.1.3 Reconstruction of top-quark pairs

The W \(\to l\nu\) and W \(\to\) jj decays are reconstructed as described in the previous sections. The procedure for the reconstruction of both, the t \(\to bl\nu\) and t\(\to jjb\) decays simultaneously, consists in choosing all possible pairs of b\(l\nu\) and jjb combinations and then compute \(m_{t\bar{t}}\), if each pair satifsy the combination satisfays the cut \(m_{\,j{\rm j}b({\rm k}\nu)}=m_{\,top}\pm 30\) GeV. The distributions of \(m_{\,b\nu}\) and \(m_{\,jjb}\) selected for the top-quark pairs reconstruction inside the chosen mass window are shown in Fig. 8.

Once both top-quarks are reconstructed, their 4-vectors can be rescaled by applying a constraint on \(m_{t}\) before reconstructing \(m_{\,H/A}\). Fig. 9 shows the distributions for the reconstructed invariant mass of the t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pair, obtained from H \(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) decays with \(m_{\,H}=\) 370, 400 and 450 GeV and for the t\(\overline{\rm t}\) continuum. The resolution increases from \(\sigma_{m}=\) 36 GeV with 33 % of the events falling outside the \(\pm 2\sigma\) mass window to \(\sigma_{m}=\) 59 GeV with 10 % of the events outside the mass window when \(m_{\,H/A}\) increases from 370 to 450 GeV.

Tables 5 and 6 show the efficiencies for single top and full t\(\overline{\rm t}\) reconstruction and the overall acceptances for the signal and background for a \(m_{\,H/A}=\) 370, 400 and

Figure 7: _Reconstructed distribution of \(m_{b\nu}\) for: a) 400 GeV signal, b) 450 GeV signal and d c) \(t\overline{\rm t}\) continuum background events from Fig. 6 after subtracting the combinatorial background events._

450 GeV and for \(m_{t}=175\) GeV. These acceptances include a lepton reconstruction efficiency of 90%, and a b-tagging efficiency of 60%.

Table 7 shows the expected number of events for signal and \(\rm t\overline{t}\) continuum background for an integrated luminosity of 3 10\({}^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) and 10\({}^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\). The background from continuum \(\rm t\overline{t}\) production is unfortunately much larger than the signal; the signal-to-background ratio varies between 3.0 % and 6.4 % in the range of Higgs-boson and top-quark considered masses. Given the large \(\rm t\overline{t}\) mass bin needed to collect the signal (see Table 6), it is clear that the signal can only be observed above the continuum background as an excess of events. This is well illustrated in Fig. 10 for (a) \(m_{H/A}=370\) GeV, (b) \(m_{H/A}=400\) GeV and (c) \(m_{H/A}=450\) GeV for events in which both \(\rm t\to b\,l\nu\) and \(\rm t\to jjb\) decays are reconstructed inside the chosen mass window. The solid histogram shows the summed signal+background distribution, the dashed histogram shows only the background events, while the dark one shows the contribution from \(\rm H/A\to t\overline{t}\).

The results obtained with this algorithm and those obtained in [3] are compatible.

### Second Algorithm

#### 3.2.1 Single top-quark reconstruction in the hadronic channel

In the second algorithm the \(\rm W\to jj\) candidates are reconstructed as described in the previous sections (3.1.1). For each candidate with \(m_{jj}=80\pm 20\) the jj

Out of all possible jjb combinations the one which minimises the value of \(\chi^{2}=(m_{\,jjb}-m_{\,t})^{2}\) is chosen. Fig.11 shows the reconstructed invariant mass with initial and final state radiation and hadronisation/decays in the event generation. The resolution is \(\sigma=11.7\) GeV for the best combination of the _jjb_ with 20% of the events falling outside the \(\pm 2\sigma\) mass window. The peak is almost Gaussian and well centered around \(m_{top}\). Once the W-mass constraint has been applied to the reconstructed W \(\rightarrow\) jj, the t \(\rightarrow\)_jjb_ resolution is dominated by the quality of the b-jet reconstruction.

**3.2.2 Single top-quark reconstruction in the semileptonic channel**

The \(\mathrm{W}\to l\nu\,\mathrm{candidates}\) are reconstructed as described in section 3.1.2. For events containing a reconstructed candidate, each of the four possible b\(l\nu\) combinations is considered and the one which best reconstructs the top-quark mass, i.e. which minimises the value \(\chi^{2}=(m_{bl\nu}-m_{\,t})^{2}\), is chosen as the top-quark candidate. Fig. 12 shows the resulting \(m_{bl\nu}\) distributions. A resolution of \(\sigma_{m}=9.6\) GeV is obtained with 18% of the events falling outside the \(\pm 2\sigma\) mass window.

**3.2.3 Reconstruction of top-quark pairs**

The procedure for the reconstruction of top-quark pairs consists in taking all possible \(\not{jj}\) combinations and applying the W-mass constraint, then all possible \(l\nu\) combinations plus two b-jets are considered and a loop over (_jjb_, \(bl\nu\)) pairs is per

formed. After, the best combinations, which minimise the value of the equation (2) are taken into account.

\[\chi^{2}=\left(m_{\,jjb}-m_{\,t}\right)^{2}/\sigma_{\,jjb}+\left(m_{\,k\nu}-m_{\, t}\right)^{2}/\sigma_{\,bb\nu} \tag{2}\]

Fig. 13 shows the distributions of \(m_{\,bb\nu}\) and \(m_{\,jjb}\) selected as optimal for the top-quark pairs reconstruction inside the chosen mass window and for the low-luminosity b-tagging performance.

Once both top-quarks are reconstructed, their 4-vectors can be rescaled by applying a constraint on \(m_{t}\) before reconstructing \(m_{\,H/A}\). Fig. 14 shows the mass distribution for H/A \(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) with \(m_{\,H/A}=370\), 400 and 450 GeV and for t\(\overline{\rm t}\) continuum background. The expected resolution increase from \(\sigma_{m}=13\) GeV with 29.1% of the events falling outside the \(\pm 2\sigma\) mass window to \(\sigma_{m}=20\) GeV with 6.3% of the events outside the mass window when \(m_{\,H/A}\) increases from 370 to 450 GeV.

Tables 8 and 9 show the efficiencies for single \(t\) and t\(\overline{\rm t}\) pairs reconstruction and the overal acceptances for the signal and background for a \(m_{\,H/A}=370\), 400 and 450 GeV, tan\(\beta=1.5\) and \(m_{\,top}=175\) GeV.

Table 10 contains the expected number of events for the signal and t\(\overline{\rm t}\) continuum background for an integrated luminosity of 3 10\({}^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\)and 10\({}^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\). The expected background from t\(\overline{\rm t}\) continuum is smaller than the one observed with previous algorithm; the signal-to-background rate varies between 6.3% and 13.4% in the considered range of Higgs-boson and top-quark masses considered.

Fig. 15 illustrates the expected signal+background \(m_{\,tt}\) distribution, for H/A \(\to\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) with \(m_{\,H/A}=370\), 400 and 450 GeV, above the smooth continuum background for an integrated luminosity of 3 10\({}^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\) and in the range 300-650 GeV. The continuous line corresponds to a polynomial fit of the t\(\overline{\rm t}\) continuum background spectrum in the range 300-400 GeV for \(m_{\,H/A}=370\) GeV and in the range 400-650 GeV for \(m_{\,H/A}=400\) and 450 GeV. The peak has been extracted (bottom plots) using only statistical errors. For \(m_{\,H/A}=500\) GeV the cross-section is reduced due to the negative interference with continuum t\(\overline{\rm t}\) production, the total top-quark cross section differs little from the cross section with no Higgs present [4].

Table 11 shows the fit results after background subtraction:

## 4. Comparison of algorithms.

The second algorithm improves substantially the signal resolution with respect to the first one (from 36 to 13 GeV for \(m_{\,H/A}=370\) GeV and from 60 to 20 GeV for \(m_{\,H/A}=4\,50\) GeV), therefore the signal-to-background ratio (from 3.0% and 6.4% to 6.3% and 13.4%) and the statistical significance (from 16.8 and 9.9 to 24.3 and 14.2), because only the best combinations (jjb, bl\(\nu\), t\(\overline{\rm t}\)) have been taken into account. However, the first algorithm is interesting as it reproduces in more unbiases way the shape and magnitude of the combinatorial background to the t \(\rightarrow\) jjb hadronic channel and of the jj\(\nu\) background to bl\(\nu\) semileptonic channel.

Table 12 shows the main differences and the results obtained for the two algorithms studied in this work.

## 5. Fitting procedure.

Increasing the background by 1% or 3% and then doing the substraction, we can obtain an estimation of the systematic errors from overal normalisation but not on the shape, simply because we keep the same shape. In fact to get more convincing (in terms of systematics) background subtraction one should fit the background only outside the expected signal window, i.e. for \(m_{\,H/A}=370\) GeV it would mean below 345 GeV and above 395 GeV (the signal resolution is \(\sim 13\) GeV) and for \(m_{\,H/A}=450\) GeV below 410 GeV and above 490 GeV (the signal resolution is \(\sim 20\) GeV). In the \(m_{\,H/A}=400\) GeV case is more difficult because we are just in the region of background having the peak as well, so one will have to quote rather excess on events.

Figure 16 shows the polynomial background fit outside the mass window for \(m_{\,H/A}\) = 370 GeV and \(m_{\,H/A}=450\) GeV.

Figure 17 represents the signal+background fit for H/A \(\rightarrow\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) with \(m_{\,H/A}=370\) and 450 GeV using the polynomial obtained previously plus a gaussian.

In order to chek that the signal does not disappear when the background changes, we reconstruct t\(\overline{\rm t}\) background with only one b-tagging but assuming the same normalisation outside mass window. The background has changed around 9% in few bins below mass peak. Figure 18 shows the new background shape (top), the line denotes the expected theoretical background (polynomial obtained previously), the

signal+background fit (bottom) is performed using the polynomial obtained plus a gaussian.

When the background shape changes around 9% in few bins below mass peak, the mean value obtained doing the fit changes around 2% (from 447 GeV to 454 GeV), therefore the signal does not disappear. However, the sigma decrease around 23% (from 21 GeV to 16 GeV) because the new background is wider in the range 380-440 GeV and then the signal peak is better defined.

The next table 13 shows the fit results corresponding to the signal. The first column reports the different methods used, the second and third the gaussian parameters. \(R\) is the expected number of events for signal, and finally the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fit. The parameters obtained doing the background+signal fit (Fig. 17) are consistent with just fitting the signal alone (Fig. 14). Though it is not true for the \(R\) parameter because when the background is added to the signal, it is in hiding the peak signal and therefore the gaussian+polynomial fit not obtains a good expected number of events for signal.

## 6. Interference effects with the pure QCD process gg \(\to\) Q\(\bar{\rm Q}\)

As discussed in the literature [4][10], a signal from H/A\(\,\to\,\)t\(\bar{\rm t}\) decays would appear as a peak in the t\(\bar{\rm t}\) invariant mass spectrum above the t\(\bar{\rm t}\) continuum background for values of _m\({}_{H}\)_ smaller than 500 GeV. There is an interference between the signal and background amplitudes which causes an oscillating structure of the differential cross-section around \(\bar{\rm s}\)=\(m_{H}^{2}\). This leads to a strong suppresion of the observability of the signal at higher masses. For _m\({}_{H}\)_ = 500 GeV the total top-quark cross-section differes very little from the cross-section with no Higgs present. This interference effect is much stronger for the A than for the H boson. From the results presented in [4][10] this supression is roughly estimated to be 30% for _m\({}_{H}\)_ = 370 GeV, 50% for _m\({}_{H}\)_ = 400 GeV and 70% for _m\({}_{H}\)_ = 450 GeV.

The table 14 shows the observability of the H/A \(\rightarrow\) tt channel including the effect of the negative interference with continuum production.

Theses numbers show a significant suppresion for a Higgs mass of 450 GeV, which becomes even stronger for 500 GeV. As a result, we cannot claim any longer that we can extract a signal after 30 \(fb^{-1}\) for 450 GeV with a significace exceeding 5\(\sigma\). There is however still a large significance at 370 GeV. For \(M_{H}\) = 400 GeV signal peak is just on the bakcground peak one estimate sensitivity as an excees of events taking sensitivity as _S/_0.01\(B\).

## 6 Conclusions

In this note the expected potential of the ATLAS detector at LHC, for discovering a MSSM Higgs boson in the H/A \(\rightarrow\) tt channel has been discussed.

The background coming from continuum tt production is expected to be much larger than the H/A decays signal. The W + jets background is neglibile.

Two algorithms for reconstructing the invariant mass of the tt pair have been studied and compared. The second algorithm improves substantially the signal res

The rough estimation of the effect of the negative interference with continuum production has been included._olution with respect to the first one, because only the best combinations (jjb, bl\(\nu\), t\(\overline{\rm t}\)) have been taken into account. However, the first algorithm reproduces in more unbiases way the shape and magnitude of the combinatorial background.

The mass resolution for H/A \(\rightarrow\) t\(\overline{\rm t}\) decays is about 13 and 20 GeV for a \(m_{\,H/A}\) of 370 and 450 GeV respectively. This implies that a typical mass window to observe most of the signal would be between 25 and 80 GeV. With such a wide mass windows, the signal-to-background rate varies between 6.3% and 13.4%, and the signal can be only observed as an excess of events above the kinematical peak of the background distribution, which is around \(m_{tt}=400\) GeV. However, assuming very good knowledge of the background shape, magnitude and that can be fitted from events outside the assumed Higgs mass window, an attempt to subtract the signal peak from the background have been performed. For an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\) and a Higgs mass at 370 (450) GeV about 4400 (3200) signal events on top of a background of 33000 (50600) events are found inside a mass window of \(\pm\) 26 (40) GeV. These numbers increase to 10200 (7400) signal and 75900 (117100) background events for an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\). The signal is extracted by fitting a superposition of a polynomial background and a Gaussian to the mass distribution. This is not possible for a mass of 400 GeV, since also the background peaks around this value.

There are interference effects with the pure QCD precess \(\rm gg\to Q\overline{Q}\). For \(m_{\,H}=\ 500\) GeV the total top-quark production cross-section differes very little from the cross-section with no Higgs present, therefore the rate is already low and are additionally suppressed. This supression is roughly estimated to be 30% for \(m_{\,H}=370\) GeV, 50% for \(m_{\,H}=400\) GeV and 70% for \(m_{\,H}=450\) GeV. Considering the negative interference, for an integrated luminosity of 30 (100) \(fb^{-1}\) about 2000 (5000) signal events and 37000 (85000) background are expected inside mass windows of \(\pm\) 2 \(\sigma_{m}\) for a Higgs mass of 400 GeV.

Finally, although the theoretical uncertainties on continuum t\(\overline{\rm t}\) production are much larger today, it is hoped that they would be reduced with the time, and that the experimental data at the LHC would also contribute to a better understanding of heavy flavour continuum production.
