## 1 Introduction

All the Tilecal modules will have to be measured after assembly to ensure that they are constructed within the design envelope. This is required to assure that the 64 modules that compose the Barrel or the Ext. Barrel will fit together and will not exceed the allocated space in ATLAS.

One of the methods proposed to perform this measurement is based on the use of an optical transit (also called optical _theodolite_). This method was tested during the construction of the IFAE EB Module 0.

A precision of 200\(\upmu\) was specified as a goal of the measurement, because it seemed achievable with the available instrument and sufficient to check the outer envelope.

In this note we describe the method we developed, and comment on its adequacy. Although it was not possible to teach conclusions about the module envelope, useful results about the planarity of the lateral surfaces of the module were obtained. We also reach conclusions about the applicability of this method to measurements in the module production line.

## 2 The transit

The measurements described in this note were performed with an optical transit (model WILD T2, manufactured by Leica). This instrument measures horizontal and vertical angles, which are read out by the operator on a combination of scales in which the smallest division is about 1.6 \(\upmu\)rad. Precise readings are rather time consuming; in fact, more recent instruments have digital readout. However the advantage of this rather antiquated instrument was that it could be borrowed at no cost, while the intrinsic precision is the same.

Each angle measurement is done twice: after the first measurement, the telescope is rotated by 180 deg. in the horizontal plane, and vertically flipped. The horizontal and vertical angles are read again, and the readings are averaged. This procedure eliminates most of the systematics from misalignment of the optical and rotation axes.

The manufacturer's specifications give for the rms measurement error of the angle a value of 4 \(\upmu\)rad, and we estimated a pointing error (systematic) of 4 \(\upmu\)rad also.

## 3 The method

The aim is to measure a set of points on each lateral surface of the module, and to reconstruct their 3D coordinates. We will refer to these points as 'target points'. We chose to use four observation points (OP) to perform the measurements; the transit is placed at each of these points, and an appropriate target is placed at any of the other OPs to define one of the two lines-of-sight that make up an angle, the other line being defined by the target point (see Fig. 1).

The approximate positions of the four OP's are shown in Fig. 1; each of the two module surfaces is fully visible from two OPs, but not from the other two. Therefore before beginning the module measurements, the positions of the OPs must be established. This preliminary step is described in section 5.

Figure 1: Position of the four observation points with respect to the module. The transit is placed on the top of one of the + columns; the position of the OPs is defined as the interested of the horizontal and vertical axes of the transit in each of the four positions.

Practical considerations limit the positioning of the four observation points. In our case, the limiting factors were the space available in the assembly area and the minimal distance between the target point and the transit to obtain a focused image, which is 2.2 m. Within these limits, the OPs were placed to minimize the error in obtaining the y coordinate (see next section for the definition of coordinates). The optimization was made simulating the errors from the transit reading, its setting and pointing error, and the error on the distance between the OPs while varying the positions of the OPs on a rectangle centered on the module.

The comfort of one of the authors of this note, who made most of the transit measurements, determined the choice of the height of the OPs.

## 3 1 Definition of the coordinates

The reference frame was chosen as shown in Fig 2.

The important coordinate for envelope measurements is \(y\), because it is directly related to the gap between adjacent modules. This is the only coordinate that we aim to measure to better than 200.

It is necessary to measure the z coordinate of the TPs in order to obtain their deviation from the nominal position because the module lateral surfaces are inclined by m/64 rad (2.8125 deg.) to the vertical. However, an error of 1mm in z will imply only a 50 error in the calculated nominal coordinate \(y\).

The x coordinate does not need to be precisely measured for this study.

Figure 2: Coordinate system used for module measurements.

### Obtaining the \(x\),\(y\) coordinates.

Given the distance \(d\) between OPs 2,3 (or 1,4) the \(x\), \(y\) of a point on the module lateral surface is obtained by simple triangulation, as shown in Fig. 3.

However to relate the position of points on the two lateral sides of a module requires knowing the relative position of all four OPs.

### Obtaining the \(z\) coordinate.

The \(z\) coordinate is obtained by measuring the vertical angle, however its calculation requires also the \(x\),\(y\) coordinates calculated above; this is shown in Fig. 4. Two independent measurement of each \(z\) can be made by measuring each TP from the two observation points that see it, this redundancy turned out to be extremely useful when reconstructing the positions of the TPs in 3D.

## 4 Mechanical setup of the transit.

The main requirement is that the transit must be very repeatably placed at the observation positions, with errors consistent with requirements on measurement errors. To ensure that, four precisely machined transit platforms were made; each platform in turn is mounted on a very rigid steel column. The columns, schematically shown in Fig. 1, are shown together with the transit platforms in Fig. 5.

Each platform can be leveled by adjusting the three setting screws; the angles to the horizontal were minimized by using an electronic level (Wyler MINILEVEL A10). One limiting factor in this procedure was the small diameter of the base of the transit, which has a diameter of about 8 cm, less than the contact surface of the electronic level (15 cm).

Errors in leveling the transit base directly translate into systematic errors in measuring the angles, which may then generate a spurious relative rotation of the two lateral surfaces of the module.

Figure 5: Steel column and transit mounting platform.

## 5 Determination of the position of the observation points

Measuring the angles between the lines that join each pair of OPs determines their relative positions, except for a scale factor which can be obtained by measuring just one distance; for instance, the distance between two OPs. The errors on the measurement of the OP positions should be such that the distance between the two lateral faces of the module should not be affected by them; thus the indetermination of the distance between OP1 and OP2, and between OP3 and OP4 should be much less than 200 micron, which is not easy to achieve over distances of a few meters.

To avoid this difficulty we chose to make angle measurements to two target points separated by a very precisely known distance \(d\). The two target points were two marks on the girder edges, whose distance had been measured at CERN with a precision of 10\(\mu\). This determines the length scale to better-than-needed precision. The geometry is shown in Fig. 6.

Several sets of measurements of the reference points were made, reconstructing from each the relative position of the four OPs. Within each set of measurements there is some redundancy, which allows making an internal estimate of the errors in calculating these positions. Both the internal estimates and the differences between repeated measurements indicate errors in the distance between the distant pairs (x coordinate) of about 3 mm, while the error on \(y\) is about 0.5 mm. The latter value is larger than desired, because it introduces the same uncertainty in correlating measurements of the two lateral surfaces of the module.

Figure 6: Knowing all the angles and the distance \(d\), the figure can be solved and the \(x\) and \(y\) coordinates of 1,2,3,+ calculated. The deviation from rectangularity of the figure is grossly exaggerated.

## 6 Organization of the measurements

A set of 38 target points was measured. They are at approximately symmetric points on the two module faces, and are distributed along 4 horizontal lines, at different heights. Each horizontal line is referred to as a _level_ and comprises 5 points, except for the top level (level 3), where the module is shorter along the \(x\) coordinate and only 4 points were measured.

The lower points were marked on the lower lateral surface of the girder (_Girder level_) which is very precisely machined and defines the module envelope; they are roughly equidistant in \(x\). The points at other three levels (_Level 1_ to _Level 3_) were marked on the outer edges of the master plates. The layout of the target points is shown in Fig. 7.

Two measurements of the 38-point set were made; the second set provided more complete and precise results, because with more operator experience the quality of the transit readings obviously improved. In the first set of measurements, 4 TPs had to be discarded due to reading errors, while all points from the second set of measurements could be used. Also, the dispersions from fitted lines and planes that will be discussed later are significantly smaller for the second set of measurements. Only the results from the second set of measurements will be discussed in this note.

It is also worth noting that it took two (albeit inexperienced) people two days to measure each set of 38 points. Measurements would be faster with a digital

transit, however the time to precisely point to the target and to repeat the measurements with the flipped transit sets a limit of maybe 2 to 5 minutes per point.

## 7 Data analysis

Using the transit readings at the 38 measured target points and the positions of the observation points the 3D positions of the TPs were reconstructed.

A first-pass reconstruction showed inconsistencies of up to 1mm in the \(z\) positions reconstructed from different OPs; this indicated that the transit bases at the four observation points had not been leveled to the required horizontality. The redundancy in the \(z\) measurement of the TPs allowed correcting for this error.

Having observed that the transit bases were not as horizontal as desired, it was not too surprising to find that the envelope of the module appeared to change with increasing height \(z\). This effect is shown in Fig. 8.

Figure 8: Apparent reduction of the module width as a function of \(z\) (height). The width is calculated from each pair of opposite points on the two sides of the module. The reduction is approximately proportional to height (the vertical bars join the values obtained at the 4 different levels; note that three of the points at Level 3 are at the lower end of the range).

This systematic effect was obviously due to the measurement. Every master plate had been pre-measured with calipers, and a systematic deviation of 0.6nm should have been evident. As an additional check,, the width of the module at Level 3 (the only one that could be measured with calipers after module assembly!) was measured again and found to at the nominal value.

Considering the observed non-horizontality of the transit bases, the most reasonable explanation of this effect is that the bases of the transit had a deviation from the horizontal of about 300 \(\mu\)rad around the x axis. The effect is illustrated in Fig.9.

This effect cannot be corrected; we were forced to abandon the measurement of the overall shape of the module. Nonetheless the measurements from each side of the module can be used to study the planarity of each surface.

Figure 9: If one transit base is deviated from the horizontality through a rotation along the \(x\) axis, it sees the module surface inclined from the nominal angle. This could have made the module look narrower or wider, depending on the sign of the rotation. The deviations coming from the two sides are added directly.

## 8 Results

### 8.1 Estimate of the error of the measurements

To estimate the measurement errors in \(y\) and \(z\), two deviations \(\delta y\) and \(\delta z\) were defined:

\[\delta y\equiv y_{measured}-y_{meas}\]

\[\delta z\equiv z_{measured}-z_{mean}\]

The _mean_ values are the average over each line of points (four lines at each side, one per level). Fig.10 illustrates the meaning of these deviations. Note that \(\delta y\) and \(\delta z\) overestimate the errors of measurement, because they include in fact the non-planarity along each line, which will be shown in the next subsection.

The _rms_ value of the distribution of \(\delta y\) is 148\(\mu\), which shows that the _local_ measurement error is less than 200 \(\mu\), as desired. The error in \(z\) is greater (about 500\(\mu\)). But, as argued in section 3.1 it still gives a negligible contribution to the error in the \(y\) coordinate.

Figure 10: The quantity \(\delta y\) is an estimator of the error in the measurement of this coordinate.

## 8 2 Planarity results

The planarity of the two module faces was separately studied by fitting the 3D coordinates of the two sets of TPs to two planes. In Fig. 12, the histograms of the deviations of the \(y\) coordinate from the fitted value are plotted.

The values of the _rms_ of the distributions are both under 200 \(\mu\), which appears acceptable; however there are a few points which deviate from the plane by up to 0.5 mm. To understand why, in Figs. 13 and 14 we plot the deviation from the plane at the girder and at the three different levels.

In the plot at the girder level (Fig. 13), there seems to be no important systematic effect. All deviations, which include the non-planarity but also the error of the measurement, are within a 350\(\mu\) range.

Figure 12: Dispetsion of the values of \(y\) around the value cottesponding to the fitted plane.

Figure 13: Deviation from planarity at the gidder level. No systematic effect appears, and all deviations are less than 350\(\mu\).

On the contrary, in the levels 1 to 3 (Fig. 14) there are clear hints of systematic deviations from the plane. They are not measurement errors because measurements of both sides (performed from different pairs of OPs) have the same behavior. Also there is a clear correlation between measurements at different heights.

At the first and second level it is possible to appreciate a deviation of 200-350\(\mu\) of the TTC sub-module (the 3\({}^{\rm rd}\) level does not contain any point of the TTC). Also the first of the regular sub-modules shows a slight torsion: it slightly deviates on one side at the 1\({}^{\rm m}\) level (the 'negative' side), while it slightly deviates to the 'positive' side in the 2\({}^{\rm nd}\). In the 3\({}^{\rm rd}\), the deviation is of 500\(\mu\) in the positive direction.

The observation of a deviation from nominal in the position of the TTC was expected from the module assembly record.

Figure 1: Deviation from planarity at the three levels on the masets. Note the 200-300A deviation of the ILC at levels 1 and 2, and also the totsion of the 2\({}^{\rm nd}\) regular sub-module measured, the fit at that starting by the left.

## 9 Summary and conclusions

As said in the introduction, two sets of conclusions can be extracted from the work described here: about the module quality, and about the transit-based method itself. We give the summary and the conclusions separately for these two issues.

### About the module envelope

\(\bullet\) The deviations from planarity of the two surfaces have rms of 170\(\mu\) and 200\(\mu\) respectively. This includes the irregularities of the surfaces convoluted with the error of the measurement.

\(\bullet\) There is a hint of torsion of the module at one end (500\(\mu\) of maximum deviation), and also a hint of a displacement of the TCC (of about 250\(\mu\)).

\(\bullet\) Due to the non-horizontally of the transit bases we cannot use _only_ the transit measurements to tell whether the module is within the tolerance envelope.Complementing the transit measurements with previous measurements of the submodules one might reach a conclusion about the module envelope, however this procedure appears undesirable.

### About the method

\(\bullet\) The rms value of the error on the'relevant' module coordinate (the \(y\) coordinate) is 150\(\mu\). This is an upper limit, because this estimator includes the non-planarity of the surface.

\(\bullet\) The full envelope could be reconstructed if the transit based rotations could be kept within 50 \(\mu\)rad; this should be possible with different transit supports.

\(\bullet\) The procedure is very time-consuming and severely limits the number of points that can be measured.

\(\bullet\) A modern (and more expensive) digital transit would allow considerable time savings. However it is hard to envisage measuring more than 100 points (50/side) on all modules during series production.

\(\bullet\) As a conclusion, we cannot recommend this method to check series production of 64 modules.
