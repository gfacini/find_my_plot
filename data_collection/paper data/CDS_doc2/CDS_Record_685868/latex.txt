## 1 Introduction

One of the serious problems of an inner detector in a general purpose LHC experiment is the occupancy due to the small distance from the interaction point, the high particle rate and the occupation time of the detector. This occupancy is usually predicted tracking with an event generator together with the GEANT Monte Carlo simulations the detailed detector layout in it. One of the problems to describe the reality might be the backsplash rate in the inner detector from the electromagnetic calorimeter, which comprises a high material density and therefore a high backsplash probability. Although it affects only electromagnetic interacting particles (\(e\), \(\gamma\)) a significant deviation from the Monte-Carlo prediction may be dangerous.

## 2 Geometry

Using a TRD-detector the RD6-collaboration has measured this backsplash probability during the test run in autumn 1992 with a setup shown in figure 1. The distance of the lead to the tracking device was 5 cm to get a more prominent effect, although this distance will be approximately 40 cm in the case of ATLAS. In order to have a more realistic simulation of LHC conditions, a magnetic field was used. Althoughthe magnetic field was about 10 times lower than in ATLAS, its geometry was set in such a way that most of the backsplash particles were focused into the TRD, since their spectrum is decreasing rapidly with increasing energy. Therefore we believe that for a stronger field than the one used, the amount of backsplash should not change dramatically.

## 3 Event selection and analysis

In this paper we present the analysis of the data and compare the results with the Monte Carlo predictions. We studied in particular the behaviour of the backsplash from a lead brick, as a function of the energy of the incoming particle, the particle type (\(e\),\(\pi\)), the angle between the particle and the brick surface and the magnetic field. In order to understand fine details of the Monte-Carlo simulation we compare also the energy spectrum of particles outside the trackroad of the incoming particles consisting mainly of \(\delta\)-electrons and in addition near to the lead brick of backsplash particles. The tracked is defined for each event individually as the corridor in the y-coordinate around the fitted track. The half size of that corridor is the radius of a straw plus three standard deviations of the measured space resolution in y.

Since this measurement is very sensitive to noise we reject noisy straws and dead straws by measuring the probability of a straw to have a hit outside the well defined trackroad of the incoming particle. Thus of the considered \(5\cdot 96\) straws (the upper 5 straws in each \(z\)-row) we cut out about 8% (noisy) and 3% (dead). To have a further noise reduction we required in addition for every hit to have at least 0.5 KeV energy. We fit the datapoints corresponding to the hit probability outside the trackroad of the incoming particle as a function of the z-coordinate with a polynomial of the 5th order, demonstrated in figure 2 for one case. In the following plots of the hit probability only the fitted curves are presented. We first measured this probability for electrons at two different energies (figure 3) with no backsplash with and without the magnetic field.

## 4 Results

In figure 4 is shown the experimental dependence of the backsplash detection probability on the energy of the incoming electrons (20, 30 and 60 GeV) and on the presence of the magnetic field for the case of \(45^{0}\) between the particle beam and the lead brick. A clear increase with the energy as well as with the magnetic field is observed compared with the no backsplash situation. With an angle between the particle direction and the brick of \(90^{0}\) the backsplash detection probability is reduced compared to \(45^{0}\) in the case of a magnetic field at 60 GeV, whereas without magnetic field at 30 GeV the backsplash detected is compatible for both angles but significantly above the no backsplash situation (figure 5).

It was detected that the energy distribution of the hits outside the trackroad with brick is only slightly different to that without brick, indicating that the energy spectra of the charged backsplash particles, presumably electrons, and the \(\delta\)-electrons are similar. Figure 6 compares these energy spectra for the case of hits near to the brick with the most backsplash (45\({}^{0}\), 60 GeV electrons, \(B\neq 0\)) and that without backsplash.

We simulated this test beam setup with the GEANT Monte-Carlo. We also observed for electrons the increase of backsplash detection with energy and with magnetic field in the Monte-Carlo, as shown in figure 7 for a 45\({}^{o}\) brick angle. We also detected a decrease of backsplash detection with an angle of the lead brick of 90\({}^{o}\) compared with 45\({}^{0}\) in the case of a magnetic field at 60 GeV, whereas without field at 30 GeV there is no visible difference in backsplash for the two angles (figure 8). The energy spectra of the Monte-Carlo hits with and without brick are also found to be compatible with each other as shown for the hits near to the 45\({}^{o}\) brick and for the hits without brick in figure 9 for 60 GeV electrons with magnetic field.

Every feature due to the backsplash which was visible in the experimental data was also qualitatively found in the Monte-Carlo simulation. From the quantitative point of view, we do not observe any discrepancy in hit probability between Monte-Carlo and data for the no backsplash situation (figure 10). Nevertheless for the case with brick we found a difference in amount of backsplash particles of about a factor two, shown in figure 11 as one example for the most sensitive case (45\({}^{0}\), 60 GeV electrons, \(B\neq 0\)). On the other hand the experimental energy spectrum of the hits near to the brick for the case with the most backsplash (45\({}^{0}\), 60 GeV electrons, \(B\neq 0\)) shows no significant deviation from the simulated spectrum (figure 12). In order to draw conclusions if backsplash will be a serious problem for the inner detector of ATLAS, one is interested in the backsplash probability from photons, which are very often produced in ATLAS compared with electrons. Therefore we simulated within the same conditions photons hitting the brick. The comparison of the backsplash from electrons and photons for the case with the most backsplash (45\({}^{0}\), 60 GeV, \(B\neq 0\)), as shown in figure 13, indicates, that backsplash from photons is about 25% smaller than from electrons. In consideration of the energy dependence of the backsplash from photons as shown in figure 14 the in the environement of ATLAS mainly produced low energetic photons are producing small amounts of backsplash.

To investigate if only the primary particle is the main source of backsplash, we generated electrons as well as photons after the the TRD, but before the lead brick. To have the same conditions for the trackroad as before, we defined an artificial trackroad extrapolating the particle back through the TRD, which was excluded to calculate the hit probability outside the trackroad as we did before. In this case the backsplash is exclusively produced by the primary particle. The comparison between electrons and photons within the same conditions as for figure 13 is shown in figure 15. The hit probability for both particle types is reduced by about 30%. Taking into account the hit probability in the no backsplash situation without any material after the TRD, only 5% of backsplash is due to secondary in the TRD produced particles at low energies, whereas about 95% is coming from the primary particle, as shown in figure 16. The total kinematic energy of all backsplashed particles hitting the TRD is on average only 2.4 MeV for a primary electron of 60 GeV.

As a byproduct we compared also the hit probability along the z-axis for pions outside the trackroad and found a clear overestimation in the Monte-Carlo (see figure 17). We are investigating wether this could be due to the way pion triggers are defined in the data.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

We have investigated also systematic uncertainties like the dependence on the energy cut threshold for particles in GEANT (10-500 KeV), on different \(dE/dx\) calculation models, on small deviations from the angle between the beam and the brick, on the thickness of the brick and on the distance of the brick to the TRD, the amount of material before the TRD, but we did not find a strong dependence. Our results are also not affected by the introduction of synchroton and transition radiation in the GEANT Monte-Carlo which are not existing in the official version.

One reason for the lower amount of backsplash particles in the Monte-Carlo might be the underestimation of the tails in the showerprofile inside the lead brick which is considered to be the main source of backsplash. These tails might be based on the contribution from individual Rutherford scattering.

## 5 Conclusion

The RD6 collaboration has measured the backsplash using the TRD prototype in a special setup. With respect to the ATLAS geometry, this setup was much more sensitive to backsplash, allowing detailed comparison with simulations. We have compared these measurements to a Monte Carlo simulation using a program similar to the one used for general ATLAS simulation (DICE).

We investigated the intensity of backsplash from incoming electrons as a function of the primary electron energy, of the angle between lead brick and beam and of the magnetic field. The backsplash intensity is measured to strongly increase with the energy of the incident electron and with the presence of the magnetic field, which focuses the backsplashed particles back into the TRD.

The simulated backsplash has the same behaviour as the data, but is about a factor two less for all conditions. It is produced mainly by the high energetic, primary particle rather than by secondary particles generated in the material before the lead brick. The amount of backsplash from photons is about 30% less than from electrons and is also strongly increasing with increasing energy.

Both measured and simulated backsplash decrease strongly with the distance from the brick and even in this geometry are at the same level as normal \(\delta\)-electrons at about 40 cm distance from the brick, which is the approximate distance between the last tracking element and the beginning of the calorimeter.

This simulation shows that even taking into account the fact that most of the electromagnetic interacting particles producing the backsplash in the LHC conditions are low energy photons, one should be careful in the estimation of detector occupancies due to backsplash in the ATLAS inner tracker.
