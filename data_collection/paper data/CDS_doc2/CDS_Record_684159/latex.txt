**Abstract**

During the assembly of the ATLAS precision muon chambers (MDT), the stacking of the tube layers will be monitored. Using a system of multipoint monitors with transparent silicon strip sensors (MPA), the positioning of the cross plate with respect to the assembly jigs on the granite table can be controlled with an overall accuracy of \(\approx 7\ \mu m\).

## 1 Concept

In order to monitor the positioning of the cross plates with respect to the jigs on the granite table during the assembly of the MDT chambers with the layered method (see [1]), an optical alignment system is proposed as sketched in Fig. 1 and 2. \(2\times 3\,\)laser beams monitored by MPA sensors [2] which are mounted on the granite table define the reference frame. MPA sensor modules mounted on the outside of the spheres on either side of the cross plates measure the reproducibility of the positioning of the spacer frame on the granite table in two coordinates during all assembly steps. The same standard sensor modules with ASIC readout [3] as developed for DATCHA tests and the ATLAS muon spectrometer will be used.

The position resolution of the sensors has been verified with a series of 150 prototypes giving a mean resolution of 4 \(\mu m\) with an RMS of 2 \(\mu m\) over the full sensor surface of \(20\times 20\) mm\({}^{2}\) without any sensor-specific calibration. Including such calibrations the spatial resolution is improved to 1 \(\mu m\) (see Fig. 3) [4]. A similar position resolution of at least 1 \(\mu\)m is achieved without calibration over the measurement range of about 100 \(\mu\)m needed for monitoring of the MDT assembly procedure.

In total \(4\times 3=12\) MPA sensors will be mounted on the granite table to measure the directions of the laser beam. The geometry of the setup is given by the tube diameter and pitch as shown in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. This guarantees that the optical system which defines the reference frame can stay without any modification during the whole assembly process on the granite table. Four modules with three sensors are used as references at both ends of the two laser beams. The three sensors correspond to the stacking of the three tube layers in each multilayer and are positioned relative to each other with \(\mu m\) precision on a common ceramic board (see Fig. 5).

About 1/3 of the total active area of each of the three sensors is read out by one common standard sensor electronics board connected to each module of three sensors. The available active area on each sensor of \(6.6\times 6.6\) mm\({}^{2}\) is more than sufficient since only deviations of about 100 \(\mu m\) have to be monitored. The diameter of the laser beam should stay within \(1.5-2.5\) mm over the hole distance between the two modules on either end of the laser beam (approx. 4 m) giving at least 5 active channels on each sensor.

The \(2\times 3=6\) sensors used to measure the position of the (three) cross plates have to be mounted at the outside of the cross plate supports holding the spheres. The three sensors in one row, the corresponding two reference sensor modules and the laser source should be connected by a tube to minimise the influence of external light. A small gap of, for example, 5 mm in the tube connection between the reference modules and the sensors at the cross plates is allowed.

The time needed for the measurement and reconstruction of the laser beam positions on the sensors is on the order of a few seconds. All basic software componentsfor the system have already been developed and tested.

The system will be implemented in the assembly stage for the MPI BOS prototype in 1997. It will be made exportable for the following prototypes of the other production sites and for the ATLAS MDT chamber production.

## 2 Reconstruction of the Cross Plate Position

The reference modules can easily be mounted with a precision on 0.1 mm in y- and z-direction 1 relative to the jigs on the granite table. This is needed to keep the laser beam in the centre of the active area on the sensors. The methods to monitor the y- and z-position of the cross plates are identical. It is therefore sufficient to consider only one of them (\(y\)) in the following.

Footnote 1: The coordinate frame is defined in the standard way for the ATLAS MDT chambers, i.e. the x-axis is parallel to the tubes.

The absolute y-position, with respect to the granite table, of the laser beam on the sensor (\(i,j\)) is given by (see Fig. 6):

\[\vec{y}_{i\,j}=y_{i\,j}+y_{ij}^{0} \tag{1}\]

where \(y_{i\,j}\) is the y-coordinate measured in the coordinate frame of the individual sensor at the x-position \(i=1,\,2,3,4,5\) and the y-positions \(j=1,2,3\) and \(j=4,5,6\). \(y_{ij}^{0}\) is the distance of the sensor (\(i,j\)) from the granite table. After the first tube layer is glued onto the cross-plates the values of \(y_{i\,1}\) are measured. When the following layers are glued, we want to monitor the position of the cross-plates (spheres) with respect to the first layer. If we look at the sensor at the x-position 2, the variable that we want to monitor when glueing the second layer is \(y_{22}^{0}-y_{21}^{0}\) which is given by:

\[\Delta y = y_{22}^{0}-y_{21}^{0} \tag{2}\] \[= (\vec{y}_{22}-y_{22})-(\vec{y}_{21}-y_{21})\] (3) \[= \frac{(y_{52}-y_{51})-(y_{12}-y_{11})}{x_{5}}\cdot x_{2}+(y_{12}- y_{11})-(y_{22}-y_{21})+d_{y} \tag{4}\]

where \(d_{y}\) is the distance between the sensors mounted on the reference module at \(x_{1}=0\) and \(x_{5}\) at the y-positions 1 and 2, i.e. \(d_{y}=y_{12}^{0}-y_{11}^{0}=y_{52}^{0}-y_{51}^{0}\).

The systematic uncertainty from the position measurements on \(\Delta y=y_{22}^{0}-y_{21}^{0}\) is

\[\delta\Delta y\approx\sqrt{9}\cdot\delta y\approx 3\mu m \tag{5}\]if we assume that \(\delta d_{y}\approx\delta y\approx 1\mu m\). The contribution \(\delta x_{2}\) and \(\delta x_{5}\) from the positioning of the sensors in \(x\) can be neglected 2, if \(\delta x_{2}\approx\delta x_{5}\approx 1\ mm\).

Footnote 2: They are suppressed by \(x_{5}^{-1}\) and \(x_{5}^{-2}\), respectively, with \(x_{5}\approx 4000\ mm\)

The effect of the laser beam deflection at each sensor surface has to be corrected, as can be seen from Fig. 7. The deflection angle for each sensor is measured with an accuracy of 1 \(\mu rad\) using a test setup on a granite table. The total error on \(\Delta y\) is therefore:

\[\delta\Delta y\approx 3_{position}\oplus 6_{deflection}\approx 7\ \mu m \tag{6}\]

In the method described above the measurements taken with the first layer acct as reference measurements. Only the relative position of the following layers with respect too the first layer can be controlled. A precison mounting of the reference modules on the granite table (accuracy \(\approx 3\mu m\)) and of the MPA sensors on the spheres on both sides of the cross plates would allow a reconstruction of the absolute position of the spheres relative to the granite table. In this case also the position of the first layer could be monitored.

## 3 Conclusion

The assembly of the ATLAS MDT chambers can be monitored with an optical system based on the MPA sensors. The positions of the spheres during the glueing of the second to \(6^{th}\) layers are measured relative to the position of the spheres when glueing the first layer with an accuracy of \(\approx 5\ \mu m\) in y- and z-direction. At the same time the alignment of the 3 spheres on either site of the support structure on the same straight line is monitored during the stacking procedure. The required precision for the mounting of the reference sensors on the granite table is \(\pm 1\ mm\) along the x-direction and \(\pm 0.1\ mm\) in y- and z-direction. Both requirements can easily by fulfilled.
