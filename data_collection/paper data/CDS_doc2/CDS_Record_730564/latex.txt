## Chapter 1 Introduction

### 1.1 ATLAS at LHC

**A** Toroidal LHC **A**pparatu**S** (ATLAS) proposed by the ATLAS Collaboration is designed as a general-purpose detector for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

The LHC is a proton-proton collider with 14 TeV centre of mass energy and design luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). Beam bunch-crossing period is 25 ns and at design luminosity there are 23 interactions per crossing.

#### Purpose of ATLAS

The most important question for the LHC and ATLAS is the origin of the spontaneous-symmetry breaking mechanism in the electroweak sector of the Standard Model (SM), namely: What is the origin of the different particle masses?

One of the possible manifestations of the spontaneous symmetry-breaking mechanism could be the existence of a SM Higgs boson (H), or of a family of Higgs Particles (\(H^{\pm}\), h, H and A) when considering the Minimal Super symmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). The Higgs search is therefore used as a first benchmark for the detector optimisation. Other important goals are searches for other phenomena possibly related to the symmetry breaking, as well as new gauge bosons and evidence for composite quarks and leptons. The investigation of CP violation in B decays and precise measurements of W and top-quark masses and triple gauge boson couplings will also be important issues. These processes set ATLAS design benchmarks as follows:

* Various Higgs searches require high-resolution measurements of electrons, protons and muons, excellent secondary vertex detection for \(\tau\)-leptons and \(b\)-quarks, high-resolution calorimetry for jets and missing transverse energy (\(E_{T}^{miss}\)) are essential to explore the full range of possible Higgs boson masses.
* Searches for Super Symmetry (SUSY) set the benchmarks on the hermeticity and (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) capability of the detector, as well as on \(b\)-tagging at high luminosity.

* Searches for new heavy gauge bosons provided benchmark requirements for high-resolution lepton measurements and charge identification in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)range as large as a few TeV.
* Quark compositeness signatures set the requirements for the measurement of very high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)jets.
* The precise measurements of the W and top-quark masses, gauge boson couplings, CP violation and the determination of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa unitary triangle require precise control of the energy scale for jets and leptons, determine precisely secondary vertexes, reconstruct fully final states with relatively low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)particles and trigger on low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)leptons.

#### 1.1.2 ATLAS overview

The ATLAS experiment consists of several systems of sub-detectors and a magnet system. Closest to the interaction point there is the Inner detector (tracker) embedded in a magnetic field of about 2 T provided by the Central Solenoid (CS) magnet.

The Inner detector is surrounded by Liquid Argon (LAr) electromagnetic calorimeter and hadronic calorimeters.

Outside the calorimeters there is the Muon Spectrometer (MS) system. Magnetic field of about 4 T for the Muon Spectrometer is provided by three systems of coils: a Barrel Toroid (BT) and two End-cap toroids, which are inserted in the BT at each end and line up with the CS. The overall dimensions of the superconducting magnet system are 26 m in length and 20 m in diameter. The ATLAS superconducting magnet system can be seen in Figure 1.1.

The data necessary for Level-1 trigger (LVL1) are provided by all calorimeters and by trigger chambers of the Muon Spectrometer.

**Nomenclature**

The beam direction defines the \(z\)-axis, and the \(x-y\)-plane is the plane transverse to the beam direction. The positive \(x\)-axis is defined as pointing from the interaction point to the centre of the LHC ring, and the positive \(y\)-axis is pointing upwards. The azimuthal angle \(\phi\) is measured around the beam axis, and the polar angle \(\theta\) is the angle from the beam axis. The pseudorapidity \(\eta\) is defined as

\[\eta=-ln(tan(\frac{\theta}{2})). \tag{1.1}\]

The transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)and the transverse energy \(E_{T}\), as well as the missing transverse energy \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and other transverse variables, are defined in the \(x-y\) plane.

**Inner detector**

The layout of the Inner detector combines high-resolution detectors at the inner radii (Pixel detector and Semiconductor tracking detector (SCT)) with continuous tracking elements at the outer radii (Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT)),all contained in the CS magnetic field of 2 T. The high granularity of Pixel detector and SCT enables high-precision vertex and momentum measurements.

**Calorimeters**

A view of the ATLAS calorimeters is presented in figure 1.2. The calorimetry consists of an electromagnetic (EM) LAr calorimeter covering the pseudorapidity region \(|\eta|<3.2\), a hadronic Tile Calorimeter covering \(|\eta|<1.6\), hadronic end-cap calorimeters covering \(1.5<|\eta|<3.2\), and forward calorimeters covering \(3.1<|\eta|<4.9\). The Tile Calorimeter design is discussed in detail in Chapter 2.

**Muon spectrometer**

The layout of the muon spectrometer is based on the magnetic deflection of muon tracks in the large superconducting air-core toroid magnets, instrumented with separate trigger and high-precision tracking chambers.

Over the most of the \(\eta\)-range, a precision measurement of the track coordinates is provided by Monitored Drift Tubes (MDTs), at large pseudorapidities and closer to the interaction point by Cathode Strip Chambers (CSCs).

The trigger system consists of Resistive Plate Chambers (RPCs) in the barrel region and Thin Gap Chambers (TGCs) in the end-cap regions.

**Trigger and data-acquisition system**

The ATLAS trigger and data-acquisition (DAQ) system is based on three levels of online event selection. Each trigger level refines the decisions made at the previous level and, where necessary, applies additional selection criteria. Starting from an initial bunch-crossing frequency of 40 MHz, the rate of selected

* Their resolution improves with increasing energy (whereas the resolution of magnetic spectrometers decreases with increasing energy).
* Calorimeters in combination with tracking data allow effective identification of _e.g._ electrons.
* Calorimeters are suitable for measurements of missing (transverse) energy and jet productions. The effect of missing transverse energy is caused by neutrinos escaping the detector, but apart from them, calorimeter are suitable for energy measurement of neutral particles as well.
* Due to fast response calorimeters can be used for a trigger system.

Calorimetry refers to the detection of particles through total absorption in a block of matter - calorimeter. Calorimeter is a destructive measurement method, the only exception concerning this rule are muons, which can penetrate substantial amounts of masses represented by the calorimeter, and thus are identified as muons1.

Footnote 1: The lowest energy necessary for muon to pass through the Tile calorimeter (Tilecal) is approximately \(3-5\) GeV, it depends on pseudorapidity. Muons with energy insufficient to reach the Muon spectrometer will be stopped in Tilecal. Nowadays ( April 2003) it is not clear, whether it will be possible to identify such muons as muons for the purpose of LVL1 trigger.

As the centre of mass energy of particle physics experiments increased, the goal of many experiment changed from reconstructing in detail four-vectors of all interaction products into measuring more general features, energy flow. Features like missing transverse energy and the production of jets provided crucial signatures for interesting physics, especially when observed in combination with electron or muon production.

**Homogeneous calorimeters**

The entire volume of homogeneous calorimeters (made of for instance from one

Figure 1.3: Block diagram of the ATLAS trigger/DAQ system.

piece of NaI(Tl) crystal, lead glass block, high purity germanium, BGO crystals, liquid Krypton or Xenon, PbWO\({}_{4}\) crystals (this is the case of another LHC experiment - CMS), _etc._) is sensitive to the particles and may contribute to the signals generated by the detector. The functions of absorbing the particles and detecting the signals produced in this process are exercised by the same material, which needs to have a high density in order to perform the first function efficiently.

**Sampling calorimeters**

In case of sampling calorimeters the functions of particle absorption and signal generation are exercised by different materials, usually called the passive and active medium, respectively. The passive medium is usually a high-density material, such as iron, copper, lead or uranium. The active medium generates the light or charge that forms the basis for the signal from this calorimeter.

In sampling calorimeters, typically only a small fraction of the energy carried by the entering particles is deposited in the active medium that generates the signals. As a result, the energy resolution of sampling calorimeters is worse than for homogeneous ones, at least for photon and electron detection. On the other hand, they are also substantially cheaper and can be easily used for larger detector systems.

##### 1.2.1.1 Useful definitions

**Hermeticity**

The hermeticity of a calorimeter system indicates the fraction of a 4\(\pi\) solid angle surrounding the interaction vertex that is covered by this system. Common calorimeters achieve about 90% hermeticity.

**Scintillation**

A charged particle traversing through matter excites atoms/molecules of this matter. When these are returning to ground state a photon is emitted - if in the visible domain, this process is called fluorescence or scintillation. Organic scintillators are about 100-times faster than inorganic scintillators. Typical time of response for organic scintillators is \(\sim\) ns.

**Critical energy**

Critical energy, usually denoted as \(\epsilon_{c}\), is defined as an energy when particle energy loss through ionisation and bremsstrahlung are equal. This critical energy depends on the traversed material and on the particle mass. Let us assume the critical energy for electron (mass \(m_{e}\)) in a particular material is \(\epsilon_{e}\). Then, in the same material for a heavier particle with mass \(m\) its critical energy \(\epsilon_{c}\) is proportional to:

\[\epsilon_{c}\propto\left(\frac{m}{m_{e}}\right)^{2}. \tag{2}\]

For example critical energy for muon is approximately 40000-times higher than for electron in the same material.

**Radiation length**

When an electron or positron with energy \(E_{0}\) enters a material, it loses its energy through bremsstrahlung. This energy loss is described by radiation length \(x_{0}\). At a distance \(x\) deep in the material, the energy of the traversing particle \(E(x)\) decreases due to bremsstrahlung as follows:

\[E(x)=E_{0}e^{-\frac{x}{x_{0}}}. \tag{1.3}\]

Bremsstrahlung concerns all charged particles, but the heavier the particle, the smaller the energy loss through bremsstrahlung is. Heavier particles thus have longer radiation length for given material. Unless otherwise stated, the radiation length is meant for electron/positron.

The radiation length \(x_{0}\) for a mixture of different materials with radiation lengths \(x_{i}\) can be calculated as follows:

\[\frac{1}{x_{0}}=\sum_{i}\frac{v_{i}}{x_{i}}, \tag{1.4}\]

where \(v_{i}\) is the volume fraction of the material contained in the mixture.

**Nuclear interaction length**

The nuclear interaction length \(\lambda_{int}\) of an absorber medium is defined as the average distance a high-energy hadron has to travel inside that medium before a nuclear interaction occurs. Total cross-section for nuclear interactions \(\sigma_{tot}\) depends on the nuclear interaction length as follows:

\[\sigma_{tot}=\frac{A}{N_{A}\lambda_{int}}, \tag{1.5}\]

where \(N_{A}\) is the Avogadro constant and \(A\) is the nucleon number of the absorber medium.

**Molliere radius**

The Molliere radius \(\rho_{M}\) is often used to describe the transverse development of electromagnetic (em) showers in an approximately material independent way. It is defined as follows:

\[\rho_{M}=E_{S}\frac{x_{0}}{\epsilon_{c}}, \tag{1.6}\]

where the scale energy \(E_{S}=m_{e}c^{2}\sqrt{\frac{4\pi}{\alpha}}=21,2MeV\). A cylinder with radius \(\rho_{M}\) around the shower axis contains on average 90% of the shower energy.

#### 1.2.2 Muons traversing dense material

Except at the very lowest energy, the absorption of electrons and photons in matter is a multi-step process (shower development occurs).

The muons behave, at the same energies, in a very different way. Up to very high energies (100 GeV or higher), they lose their energy primarily through ionisation and \(\delta\)-electrons. These mechanisms account for energy losses of typicallyonly \(1-2\) MeV\(\rm{g}^{-1}\rm{cm}^{2}\) and, therefore, it takes very substantial amounts of material to absorb high-energy muons.

In iron muons lose energy at rate about \(1.1\) GeV\(\rm{m}^{-1}\). Muons bremsstrahlung compared with electrons is suppressed by a factor of \((\left(\frac{m_{e}}{m_{e}}\right)^{2}\approx 40,000\). The \(\epsilon_{c}\) for muons is at least 200 GeV. At energies below 100 GeV, the average energy loss is primarily determined by ionisation, in all absorber materials.

The mean energy loss per unit path length, \(<dE/dx>\), is given by the well-known Bethe - Bloch formula [10]:

\[-<dE/dx>=Kz^{2}\frac{Z}{A}\frac{1}{\beta^{2}}\left[\frac{1}{2}ln\frac{2m_{e}c^{ 2}\beta^{2}\gamma^{2}T_{max}}{I^{2}}-\beta^{2}-\frac{\delta}{2}\right]\,, \tag{1.7}\]

where \(T_{max}\) is the maximum kinetic energy that can be imparted to an electron in a single collision,

\(I\) is the mean excitation energy of the absorber material,

\(\delta\) is a correction term describing density effect, and

\(K=4\pi N_{A}r_{e}^{2}m_{e}c^{2}\).

For relativistic muons \(<dE/dx>\) reaches minimum value near \(\beta=0.96\) (single charged particles with an energy corresponding to such a minimum are called a minimum ionising particles (mips)).

In case of muons in relatively thin amount of material (few meters of iron), such as those represented by a typical calorimeter, the total energy loss \(\Delta E/\Delta x\) may differ substantially from the value calculated on the basis of formula (1.7). This is because of the relatively small number of collisions with atomic electrons and of the very large fluctuations in energy transfer that may occur in such collisions. Therefore, the energy loss distributions measured with thin calorimeters ("thin" for muons) reach their maximum in general below the value calculated on the basis of (1.7) and have a long tail in large energy losses, the so-called Landau tail [11]. Only for very substantial amounts of matter, _e.g._ 100 m of iron, the energy loss distribution becomes approximately Gaussian.

#### 1.2.3 The energy response of sampling calorimeters

Let us first define what we understand by calorimeter response. The calorimeter response is the average calorimeter signal divided by the energy of the particle that caused it.

An important parameter characterising sampling calorimeters is the sampling fraction of the calorimeter. A sampling calorimeter is a periodical structure of active and passive material layers. The sampling fraction \(f_{samp}\) of the calorimeter is defined as the ratio of energy \(E_{A}\) deposited by mips in the active calorimeter material in one period divided by the total energy deposited by such particles in one whole period of the calorimeter (\(E_{A}+E_{P},E_{P}\) is energy deposited by mips in the passive calorimeter material in one period). One can thus write:\[f_{samp}=\frac{E_{A}}{E_{A}+E_{P}}. \tag{8}\]

Mip is a hypothetical particle. As soon as mip starts travelling through matter, it loses energy and therefore ceases to be a mip. For all practical purposes, muons are the closest thing nature provided us in term of mips.

Even muons with energy as low as 5 GeV are not mips. Since they are highly relativistic (\(\gamma\sim 50\)), their specific ionisation is larger than for mips, due to relativistic rise (\(\delta\)-ray emission), bremsstrahlung and \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair production2.

Footnote 2: At very high energies (\(\sim\)hundreds of GeV), muons can also interact with nuclei of the traversed material [14].

**The response to electrons and photons**

Sampling calorimeter response is not the same for all particles that lose their energy through em interactions. Experimental data have led to the following conclusions: In sampling calorimeters of which the \(Z\) value of the absorber is larger than the \(Z\) value of the active medium, the response to em showers is smaller than the response to mips (so-called transition effect, Pinkau, 1965)3.

Footnote 3: This effect was also measured with Tilecal prototype modules([15]). For them, the values of \(e/\mu\) ratio are in range \(0.91-0.97\).

**The response to muons**

Accurate measurements of the muon momenta require a high-precision magnetic spectrometer. However such a spectrometer is located behind a calorimeter absorbing all other particles and thus identifying the muons.

The muons always lose some fraction of their energy in this calorimeter. This fraction may fluctuate quite strongly from event to event especially at high energies. To measure the muon momentum at the production vertex accurately, it is therefore necessary to measure this energy loss too.

#### Compensation

In general, the calorimeter response to hadrons is smaller than that to electrons of the same energy.The basic reason for this lies in the fact that in the absorption of hadronic showers a significant fraction of the energy carried by the showering particle is invisible - it does not contribute to the calorimeter signal. The main source of the invisible energy is the energy used to release nucleons from nuclei. Additional, smaller contributions come from neutrinos and muons (mainly from \(\pi\) and \(K\) decay in flight) escaping the detector.

Non-compensating calorimeters have smaller response to hadronic showers than to em showers. Compensating calorimeters are designed in order to give \(e/h\) signal ratio equal to one. This can be achieved either by boosting the non-em response or reducing the em response.

Boosting the em response can be achieved for instance by using uranium (\(U^{238}\)) absorber plates, where the fission processes induced in the non-em part of the shower development would contribute extra energy, mainly in the form of nuclear \(\gamma\)s and soft (evaporation) neutrons. The em response is also influencedby the sampling fraction and sampling frequency (thickness of one sampling period).

#### 1.2.5 Sampling fluctuations

The energy resolution of sampling calorimeters is frequently dominated by the fact, that the shower energy is sampled (This is also the case of Tile Calorimeter). The signal of a sampling calorimeter is the sum of all the signals induced by individual shower particles traversing the active calorimeter layers. Fluctuations in the number of shower particles contributing to the calorimeter signals are thus a component of the energy resolution. The sampling fluctuations of electromagnetic showers are governed by the rules of Poisson statistics. Semi-empirical formula for sampling fluctuation resolution term for _electromagnetic_ showers can be written as follows [9]:

\[(\sigma/E)_{samp}=2.7\%\sqrt{\frac{d}{f_{samp}}}.\frac{1}{\sqrt{E}}, \tag{1.9}\]

where \(d\) (mm) is a thickness of one active layer and particle energy \(E\) is expressed in GeV. The properties of the Tile Calorimeter active and passive materials are listed in Table 1.1.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c} \hline Material & Z & Density & \(\epsilon_{c}\) & \(x_{0}\) & \(\rho_{M}\) & \(\lambda_{int}\) & \((dE/dx)_{mip}\) \\  & & \((g.cm^{-3}\) & (MeV) & (mm) & (mm) & (mm) & \((MeV.cm^{-1})\) \\ \hline Iron & 26 & 7.87 & 22 & 17.6 & 16.9 & 168 & 11.4 \\ Polystyrene & – & 1.032 & 94 & 424 & 96 & 795 & 2.00 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## Chapter 2 The Tile Calorimeter

### 2.1 Mechanics

The Tile Calorimeter is a non-compensating sampling calorimeter using steel as the passive absorber and scintillating tiles as the active medium. It is a self contained unit with the read-out electronics being fully contained within the calorimeter itself. The mechanical part of the Tile Calorimeter is a laminated steel structure with pockets at periodic intervals to contain the scintillating tiles. The structure is built in a modular fashion to facilitate the construction. In addition to the function of a passive absorber, the Tile Calorimeter iron structure also provides the magnetic flux return for the ATLAS solenoid.

#### Detector design

The figure 2.1 shows the Tile Calorimeter as it is placed within the muon system of toroids in the ATLAS detector. The Tile calorimeter is divided into a central barrel (blue cylinder) covering approximately the pseudorapidity from \(-1\) to \(1\) and two extended barrels (green cylinders) extending the pseudorapidity coverage to \(\pm\) 1.6. Each of the three calorimeter barrels is constructed from 64 modules, each covering \(5.6^{\circ}\) in azimuth (in \(\varphi\)).

The assembled calorimeter structure is a self-supporting system, carrying the Liquid Argon (LAr) cryostat and Inner detectors in its middle. All three barrels are mounted on support saddles, laid on the ATLAS rail system.

Extended barrels are 2910 mm long and the barrel is 5640 mm long. All these sections have an inner radius of 2280 mm and an outer radius of 4230 mm. Between the barrel and the extended barrels there is a gap of about 700 mm ([19]). This gap is designed for cabling and other support of LAr calorimeters and Inner detector. In order to improve the hermeticity of the calorimeter, the Intermediate Tile Calorimeter (ITC) is inserted into this gap. Moreover, a flat ring of gap and crack scintillators is inserted into this gap as well. Gap scintillators are attached to one side of Extended barrel modules, crack scintillators extend further into the gaps between electromagnetic LAr calorimeter Barrel and End-caps, see Figure 2.3.

#### Module design

The long barrel module (below called just "barrel module") comprises 18 standard sub-modules each 291.7 mm long and one special sub-module 341.2 mm long bolted onto the support girder and connected together at the inner radius by a 10 mm plate welded into the key slot. In the baseline, two end-plates are bolted to the girder and welded to the inner radius plate. A gap of 0.8 mm between the sub-modules is designed in order to accommodate the manufacturing tolerances. Both end-plates are connected together by several rods, piercing through all sub-modules.

An extended barrel module comprises eight standard sub-modules each 291.7 mm long and special sub-module 201.5 mm in length. The mounting concept is identical to that for a barrel module.

ITC modules are mounted on the same girder as extended barrel modules, next to that extended barrel module end-plate, which faces the gap between barrel and extended barrel.

##### 2.1.2.1 Sub-module design

Standard sub-module.Each sub-module is a periodic sandwich structure. The structure of one period is as follows (see Figure 2.5):

* one master plate 5 mm thick that runs from the inner radius plate to the

Figure 2.1: Tile Calorimeter within ATLAS.

Figure 2.4: The barrel module. 18 standard sub-modules and 1 special sub-module in a row bolted onto the support girder (bottom of the module). In front one of the dark blue end-plates is visible. Note that the closer half of the module is already instrumented with optical fibres (details in chapter 2.2).

girder,
* onto this master plate spacers 4 mm thick are glued leaving regularly free spaces (pockets) for scintillating tiles,
* another master plate 5 mm thick, and
* a second set of spacers 4 mm thick, leaving again pockets for the scintillating tiles. This second set of spacers is shifted toward the first one: the spacers and gaps simply swapped their positions.

In one 18 mm thick period a set of 11 scintillating tiles is placed. The number one tile is the closest to the inner radius. With the increasing number of the tiles their distance from the inner radius plate increases and their size as well. The even number tiles are inserted into the first half-period, the odd number tiles are inserted into the second half period.

Figure 2.5: A side-view of a standard sub-module (top). There are glued spacers (white trapezoids in the picture) on both masters (middle and bottom). These two half-periods form one full 18 mm thick period. Scintillating tiles (light blue on both half-periods) are numbered \(1-11\).

The standard sub-module consists of 16 periods. The barrel module thus consists of 307 periods and the extended barrel consists of 140 periods (excluding the ITC part).

**Special sub-modules**

As mentioned above the Tile calorimeter supports the LAr cryostat and other detectors in its middle. These facilities are mechanically connected to the Tile Calorimeter on several points on its inner radius. On these points some of the sub-modules are cut to enable this. Other sub-modules are also cut to create space for cabling and other support for other detectors.

##### 2.1.2.2 Calibration tubes

For the calibration purpose a system of thin metal calibration tubes is inserted into each module. These tubes run eleven times through the whole module (twelve times in case of Extended barrel modules), parallel with the \(z\)-axis, and are fed through the holes in the central part of masters, spacers and tiles (see Figure 2.5). For description of the Cesium calibration system see Section 2.4.3.

##### 2.1.2.3 Girder

At the outer radius the sub-modules of any module are bolted to the girder. This girder provides the mechanical support of the module, but it also houses the Tile Calorimeter PMTs and front-end electronics in the hollow space in the middle. The holes for the optical fibres are drilled on both of its sides.

##### 2.1.2.4 Drawer shell

The calorimeter front-end electronics and photomultiplier tubes are inserted into the girder when mounted on a metal support structure called the drawer shell.

### Optics

As already mentioned, the Tile Calorimeter is a sampling calorimeter using steel as the passive absorber and scintillating tiles as the active medium. The unique feature of this detector is the independence of optical instrumentation on absorber production. The optical instrumentation of a module takes place after the iron structure of this module is completely made.

Another exceptional feature of the calorimeter is the orientation of the tiles toward the beam line. The tiles point radially to the beam line, they are inserted into the pockets between spacers. Tiles and fibres are inserted to the iron mechanical structure of a module, when this structure is already made. The optical instrumentation of a module is independent on the production process of the module iron structure. A light signal from each tile is collected by a pair of wave-length shifting (WLS) fibres, each fibre is in contact with one of the tile's open edges. These fibres run radially from tiles along the module sides to the girder, where the light mixers and PMTs are placed. Read-out cells are then defined by grouping together a set of fibres onto a PMT. Each read-out cell is thus read out by two PMTs and the cells are defined independently on the mechanical structure of the detector (in \(\eta\) and \(R\), the \(\phi\) dimension of the cells is already defined by the \(\phi\) dimension of modules.

Ionising particles crossing the tiles induce the production of light in the base material of the tiles, with wavelength in the UV range, which is subsequently converted to visible light by scintillator dyes. This scintillation light propagates through the tile to its edges, where it is absorbed by the WLS fibres and shifted to a longer wave-length, which the PMT photocathode is the most sensitive to. A fraction of the light re-emitted in the fibre is captured and propagated via total internal reflection to the PMT, where it is detected. A light mixer is inserted between the PMT and fibres to optimise the light detection uniformity.

The main aim of the optical structure of the calorimeter is to give 1 pe/mip at normal incidence/tile. That means roughly 50 pe/GeV. This goal was reached. The energy resolution of the calorimeter is thus determined mainly by

Figure 2.9: Main optical elements of the Tile Calorimeter, cross-section of module - tiles (light blue and yellow) only in one half-period are visible. In this case two tiles number 1 and 3 belonging to one cell are read-out at their edges by two optical fibres (yellow) ending at photocathodes of two PMTs (light brown) in the girder. Particles are entering from right-hand side. Each optical fibre reads out one or two tiles at one of their free edges at once.

sampling fluctuations, which should be a feature of a well-designed sampling calorimeter. With such a sensitivity the muon signals are visible in each cell.

#### Scintillating tiles

For the calorimeter a total amount of approximately \(460,000\) scintillating tiles was produced. The total weight of these tiles is \(58.5\) tons. The Tile Calorimeter contains \(11\) different sizes of trapezoidal shaped tiles, ranging from about \(229\) mm to \(368\) mm in \(\phi\) length and \(97\) mm to \(187\) mm in radial width. The general tile geometry is shown in Figure 2.10. The wave-length shifting fibres are placed in contact with the non-parallel edges of the tiles. Table 2.1 lists the dimensions and weights of the \(11\) sizes of tiles required for the calorimeter. All tiles are \(3\) mm thick. Each has two holes, \(9\) mm in diameter, through the surface for the passage of the calibration source tubes. Before inserted into the module lattice, the tiles are wrapped into \(\mathrm{Ty\mathrm{w}ek}^{TM}\), only the two non-parallel edges remain unwrapped. Closer to these tile edges \(\mathrm{Ty\mathrm{w}ek}\) is painted black (so-called masking) in order to maintain the tile response uniformity.

**Tile materials**

The base tile material is polystyrene. Two dyes are injected into this material, \(1.5\%\) of paratephenyl (PTP) as a primary Fluor and \(0.04\%\) of POPOP as a secondary fluor. The wavelength shifting process consists of a sequence of light absorptions and emissions in this system. The initial radiation at the wavelengths \(240-300\) nm induced by the ionising particles is transmitted through the polystyrene lattice till it is absorbed by a primary Fluor molecule PTP, that emits light in the wavelength of \(320-400\) nm which is absorbed by POPOP and converted to a longer blue wavelength, which is finally absorbed by the WLS fibres.

Figure 2.10: Drawing of a trapezoidal shaped tile. Two holes in the central part are visible. One of them is used for the Cesium source calibration pipe. The second one is used for mechanical connection of the tile and module iron structure.

#### WLS Fibres

WLS fibres are the next component of the calorimeter optical chain. Each fibre collects the blue scintillation light from one or two tiles, re-emits it at a longer wavelength and transmits it to a PMT in the girder. Four fibres are required to read-out one side of each half-period. These foursomes of fibres are inserted into plastic profiles, protecting them against cross-talks and mechanical damage. The plastic profiles also maintain a correct position of fibres toward the tiles and improve the reflection of scintillation light coming from tiles to the WLS fibres. Thanks to the plastic profiles, the instrumentation of a module by fibres is reasonably fast.

A total number of 640,000 WLS fibres was produced for whole Tile Calorimeter, including some spare fibres. That is about 1,120 km of fibre. The chosen type of fibres is Kuraray double clad Y11 fibre, 1 mm in diameter, with attenuation length of of about \(170-260\) cm and time decay coefficient \(\tau=5.7\pm 0.1\) ns. During handling with these fibres, the cladding can be damaged and thus a light signal leak caused. In order to get a rid of false light signals caused by a Cerenkov light in the fibres, small concentrations of UVA absorber are added into the fibres.

All the fibres reading out one side of tiles of one cell (the layout of cells see Figure 2.12) are glued into a fibre bundle together with one laser fibre and several dummy fibres (or Teflon tubes) to enable later exchange of broken fibres. This exchange will no longer be possible when the calorimeter is assembled in the ATLAS pit. The fibre bundle (Figure 2.11) is cut and polished and placed in front of the light mixer.

Each side of a module has two spare laser fibres, these fibres can be exchanged for broken ones, but this is again possible only before installation of the detector into the ATLAS pit. There are two master fibres connected to 1-to-50 connector both for barrel and extended barrel module. The function of

\end{table}
Table 2.1: Tile dimensions and weights.

laser fibres (one laser fibre is fed to each PMT) is described in Section 2.4.2.

#### Light mixer

Most PMTs exhibit large variations in response over their photocathode surfaces, but the light extracted from the fibres inside a given bundle must be independent on the fibre location at the photocathode. The role of the light mixer is to mix the light coming from the fibres so that there is no correlation between the position of a fibre and the area of the photocathode which receives its light. The light mixer is a perspex block, with a base of approximately the same dimensions as the PMT photocathode.

#### Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs)

The PMT converts the light signal coming from the fibre bundles into an electric current signal, which is further processed by the Tile Calorimeter front electronics. For more details concerning the PMTs see chapter 2.3.1.

#### Cell and tilerows definition

As was already mentioned above, one tile (or a pair of tiles) is read out by two fibres. A set of tiles forming one cell is thus read out by two bundles of fibres,

Figure 2.11: Fibre bundles inserted into the holes in the girder. The light mixers and PMTs are placed right behind these holes inside the girder. In the upper part of the picture a 1-to-50 connector for laser fibres is visible. One of these clear fibres is joining the middle bundle. Clear fibres in the left bundle are exceptionally not wave-length shifters, they are a connection to gap and crack scintillators.

further on two PMTs, see Figure 2.13. A volume of a module, defined by all tiles of one size is called a tilerow. Any calorimeter module is thus divided into 11 tilerows. Tilerow #1 is in contact with the inner radius plate, tilerow #11 is in the closest to the girder. Tilerows also form a radial segmentation of the Tile Calorimeter. Barrel modules are radially divided into three samplings, which depth at \(\eta=0\) is approximately \(1.4\lambda\), \(4.0\lambda\) and \(1.8\lambda\). Extended barrel modules are also radially divided into three samplings, with depth at \(\eta=1.25\) approximately equal to \(2.6\lambda\), \(4.9\lambda\) and \(6.4\lambda\). Any sampling in radial depth is only one cell deep. Table 2.2 shows more details.

The \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) segmentation formed by the cell structure is \(0.1\times 0.1\). In the last third sampling called the tail catcher the segmentation is \(0.2\times 0.1\). For cell structure details and PMTs assigned to each cell see Figure 2.12.

The cells within each module placed in one pseudorapidity direction form a tower, sometimes called an adder or a trigger tower. These towers play an important role for the ATLAS Level-1 trigger.

### 2.3 Electronics

The electronics of the Tile Calorimeter are designed to take the advantage of a fast light read-out, with low noise and a limited number of channels. All front-end and digitising electronics are situated in girders, mounted on a system of super-drawers, each containing up to 48 PMTs. Phototube HVs are locally regulated. The digital information is transferred to the read-out drivers (RODs) in the counting room via a few optical fibres.

The read-out electronics of the Tile Calorimeter must process signals from 10,110 PMTs every 25 ns. Monte Carlo simulations show, that several events per year will deposit up to 1.5 TeV in a single cell, while energetic muons typically deposit 350 MeV in a single cell. The value of charge on one PMT anode corresponding to 1.5 TeV energy deposition in a single cell is about 800 pC. On the other hand, when one requires good resolution for the smallest muon signals, a charge of about 20 fC must digitised. This gives a dynamic range of 16 bits. A precision of 10 bits is required.

Signals from 2,000 trigger towers must be formed and sent every 25 ns to the Level-1 trigger as well. 10-bit dynamic range is suited to a Level-1 trigger tower capability from 1 to 250 GeV. During 2.5 \(\mu\)s of the Level-1 trigger latency the data accepted by Level-1 trigger are passed to read-out drivers (RODs) for further processing by the Level-2 trigger. The rest of the data is discarded.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|c|} \hline Barrel module & Tilerows included & Extended barrel module & Tilerows included \\ \hline Sampling \#1 (A) & 1,2,3 & Sampling \#1 (A) & 1,2,3 \\ Sampling \#2 (B, C) & 4-9 & Sampling \#2 (B, C) & 4-7 \\ Sampling \#3 (D) & 10,11 & Sampling \#3 (D) & 8-11 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Figure 2.14: General scheme of the Tile Calorimeter Read-out.

#### Read-out organisation

The general design of the electronics organisation is based upon two modular sub-systems: the PMT blocks and the super-drawers.

**PMT block**

The PMT block (see Figure 2.15) is an assembly of following main parts: a light mixer, a PMT, a divider, and a so-called 3-in-1 card. The PMT block is contained within a cylindrical shell. In between the PMT block and this cylindrical shell there is a mu-metal shell. Both these shells act as a magnetic shielding. Several cables are routed to each PMT block: a high voltage cable, a cable connecting shaper and digitiser, an adder cable for transmitting analog signals for LVL-1 trigger1 and a flat cable for transmitting logical commands to 3-in-1 cards and reading-out the integrators. The 3-in-1 card contains:

Footnote 1: These analog signals are further transmitted by delay cables into Adder summation boards, located on the drawer. The output of these boards is sent to the LVL-1 trigger outside the calorimeter.

* A fast bi-gain shaper. Low-gain and high-gain differential outputs of the shaper are further digitised, second parallel low-gain output is processed inside the Adder summation boards.
* A slow integrator circuit for measuring the current from Cesium calibrations and minimum bias events,
* a so-called charge injection system (CIS) dedicated for calibration of the shaper.

The 3-in-1 card CMOS switches and circuits are controlled via the control logic. The 3-in-1 card is directly connected to the PMT via the divider which works as a socket for the PMT without using any cables, minimising noise.

Figure 2.15: The PMT blockThe **super-drawers** are located inside the girders and contain up to 48 PMT blocks, the digitisers, the pipelines2, the Adder boards, HV distributors and a water-based cooling system. Each super-drawer consists of two physical drawers, which are coupled from the electronics point of view. There are 256 super-drawers in the Tile Calorimeter.

Footnote 2: Digitisers and pipelines are located in so-called DMU chips (A Digitising and Memory Unit), there are two DMU chips on one digitiser board. Each DMU chip contains three pairs of digitisers and pipelines (low and high gain) for three channels

All the calorimeter electronics components are described more in detail in chapters \(2.3.2-2.3.4\) below according to their function.

Figure 2.16: Location of the super-drawers in the Tile Calorimeter, showing access possibilities.

Figure 2.17: Organisation of the super-drawer electronics.

#### Read-out electronics

##### 2.3.2.1 Fast pulse electronics

##### Photomultiplier tubes

The PMT used in the Tile Calorimeter is Hamamatsu R5900. According to the set of measurements done with 1500 PMTs in Pisa (see [4]), the typical characteristics of these PMTs are listed in Table 2.3. The value of high voltage on these PMTs was set in order to achieve nominal gain of \(10^{5}\).

The gain of this 8-stage photomultiplier is well described by the following formula:

\[G=\alpha.V^{\beta} \tag{2.1}\]

The expected range of an output charge value sent by PMT due to physics events is 20 fC - 800 pC. In fact, the lower boundary of this range corresponds to pedestal signals.

##### Signal processing

The current signal from PMT is further processed by two devices contained in the 3-in-1 card: the shaper and the integrator. The fast shaper output is further used for the read-out and for the Level-1 (LVL1) trigger. The slow integrator output is used for the calibration purposes and minimum bias.

##### Shaper

The shaper is a bi-gain linear circuit placed on each 3-in-1 card, designed to process the current pulse from the photomultiplier tubes into a unipolar voltage analog signal. A 16-bit dynamic range and a maximum output swing of 4V requires an output noise level of less than 60 \(\mu\)V. There are two outputs from the shaper: low gain and high gain output. The high gain output is 64-times amplified relatively to low gain output. Both these shaper outputs are sent to the digitisers and the low-gain shaper output is also sent to the LVL-1 trigger summation circuits (Adder cards).

##### Mother boards

The mother boards are mounted on the drawer shells. In the barrel super-drawer there are four motherboards, two per drawer, number 1 is located next to the patch panel. Each motherboard section serves up to 12 channels. The motherboards carry low voltage power and digital control signals to the PMT

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline Item & Mean & Sigma \\ \hline Nominal voltage (V) & 691.0 & 34.8 \\ Quantum efficiency at 430 nm (\%) & 19.02 & 0.82 \\ \(\beta\) amplification coefficient & 6.9 & 0.1 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2.3: Some of PMT Hamamatsu R5900 characteristics according to [4]blocks. They also provide CAN bus connection between patch panel and integrator ADC card, as well as the connection between integrator ADC card and each of 3-in-1 cards.

**Digitisers and the pipeline**

The digitisers and pipelines (one pair of these for low gain and high gain of each channel) are located on digitiser boards in DMU chips. There are eight digitiser boards, each for maximum six channels. Each board carries two DMU chips (digitising and memory units), one for three channels. The shaper pulse is typically 150 ns long. Both low-gain and high-gain voltage outputs of a shaper are continually digitised in 25 ns steps, each by one 10-bit ADC, and the digitised samples are stored in the pipeline.

The digitisers for D-sampling in barrel modules and for cells C10 and D4 in extended barrels are set to have their gains 1.2 times higher than other digitisers. The reason is to amplify the muon signals in these cells.

The pipeline can store about 1000 pulses, both gains, that gives 2,5 \(\mu\)s time to the LVL1 trigger, whether accept or reject the event. Rejected events are discarded. Seven samples belonging to one accepted event are sent via ATLAS interface card to the Read-out driver (ROD), located outside the Tile Calorimeter.

**ATLAS interface card**

The ATLAS interface card is located near the middle of super-drawer on the outer drawer. It is an optical interface between digitisers and ROD. It also receives the TTC signal from optical link and sends it to the mezzanine card.

**TTC**

Trigger time control signal is sent centrally to all ATLAS sub-detectors. It is a synchronisation signal of sub-detectors and bunch-crossings. Samples stored in the pipeline are marked by this signal. The LVL1 trigger receives only analog signals from adders, these signals are identified by the LVL1 trigger only due to the TTC signal received in the time gate corresponding to the same bunch-crossing. The TTC signal is received by the ATLAS interface card, then sent to the mezzanine card located on the super-drawer and then sent to the TTCrx chips located on the digitiser cards (one chip per one card). The TTCrx chip distributes the TTC signal to DMU chips.

**Read-out driver**

The Read-out driver (ROD) collects digitised information from the calorimeter front-end electronics. The calibration corrections are here applied to the samples from each PMT signal. Signals from both PMTs reading-out one cell are converted to the value of energy deposited in the whole cell. This final information is set via optical connection to the Read-out buffer (ROB) for further processing by the LVL2 trigger. The bunch-crossing rate is 40 MHz, the LVL1 trigger accepted events rate is 75 kHz at maximum. One ROD module reads-out 8 super-drawer. The calorimeter thus needs 32 ROD modules.

#### 2.3.2 Tower electronics

The LVL1 trigger system requires trigger-tower signals from the calorimeter systems. The trigger towers are built by summing the sampling layers of the electromagnetic and hadronic sections, with a transverse size of \(0.1\times 0.1\) in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\). For the Tile calorimeter barrel five signals (channels) from the three samplings are summed in one tower: 2 from first, 2 from second and 1 from the third sampling. For some towers in the overlap region between barrel and extended barrel, fewer signals need to be summed.

Differential signals from the shaper are aligned in time to within 2 ns and summed. The adder is linear for output signals up to 250 GeV, and noise level is less than 0.25 GeV. There are up to nine adder (trigger) towers readout by one super-drawer. In addition to these adder tower, signals from cells in D-sampling are sent separately. These so-called muon trigger signals are 30-times more amplified than the signals from towers. The adder cards are mounted on the super-drawer and connected via delay cables to the PMT blocks.

#### 2.3.3 Calibration electronics

##### Charge injection system

The charge injection system (CIS) is designed to test the performance of each read-out channel over its full dynamic range (diagnostics of read-out faults, cross-talks). This system is a part of each 3-in-1 card, it consist of one 10-bit DAC with a range of 0-8 V and two capacitors with capacities of 5 pF and 100 pF. When a command to the 3-in-1 card is sent either of these capacitors is charged with the given voltage and by other command sent to 3-in-1 card discharged through the shaper. The DAC output can be also connected directly to the integrator for calibration purposes.

##### Slow charge integrator

The slow charge integrator (integrator) is a part of each 3-in-1 card, it is also part of the calorimeter calibration system. It is designed to measure the average current of each calorimeter cell due to energy depositions from the radioactive source (Cesium movable source) or from minimum bias (MB) interactions. This is used for monitoring and inter-calibration of the cells. The current is averaged long enough to suppress the influence of individual pulses from PMTs. In case of cesium the integrator is run with an integration constant of 2 ms.

Each integrator has got 6 different gains. The smallest gain is set by the largest calorimeter cell MB current at the LHC design luminosity, with a margin of 1.5 for higher currents. Outputs of all the integrators in one super-drawer can be connected via motherboard and a CMOS switch controlled by the 3-in-1 card to the integrator ADC mounted on the external drawer on motherboard. This integrator ADC is read-out via CANbus.

**Digital control of the 3-in-1 card**

The 3-in-1 card can control following actions:

* enable/disable integrator output
* set integrator input source (PMT/DAC),
* set integrator gain (6 values),
* enable/disable response to broadcast mode commands,
* enable/disable injection pulses,
* load calibration DAC.

#### 2.3.4 Power supply and high voltage distribution

The Tile Calorimeter PMTs are supplied by a high voltage (HV) power supply system. The system reflects the division of the calorimeter into 256 sub-modules, which are electronically equivalent and independent.

Each sub-module super-drawer is supplied by one of 256 HV channels. Each HV channel includes two main power supply levels: -950V and -830V ([20]). In each super-drawer a special HV distributor supplies up to 48 PMTs. The HV distributor is able to set individual PMT voltages at up to 350 V below (absolute value of) the supplied level ([21]). In total a range of voltages between 480 V and 950 V is available for each PMT individually.

#### 2.3.4.1 Super-drawer regulation units

The organisation of the super-drawer resident regulation unit is shown in Figure 2.17. It includes one bus-board and one HV distributor per drawer, one CPU board for the whole super-drawer, located in the external drawer, and a field bus.

**HV distribution board**

One HV distribution board is able to supply and regulate 24 channels.

**HV microcontroller board**

The HV microcontroller board is used to:

* read the applied voltage on each channel using the ADC, and control the addresses of the analog multiplexer on each of the two associated distribution boards,
* read the reference voltage on each channel using one of the 12 DACs on the two distribution boards, and
* read the EEPROM on each distribution channel.

It also receives and executes the commands from the master control VME in the control room.

**Bus board**

The bus board carries the HVs and low voltages (LVs) and CPU commands for the distribution boards, and HVs to each PMT.

**CANbus**

The CANbus transfers commands from the master control VME in the control room to the HV microcontroller (and it also reads-out the integrator ADC as was mentioned). The CANbus for the Tile calorimeter in ATLAS will be connected into a number of daisy chains: 16 branches of 16 super-drawers each\({}^{3}\).

#### 2.3.4.2 Low voltage power supplies

Low voltage power supply should deliver a total power of roughly 110kW to 256 DCDC converter boxes spread around Tilecal (each module finger will contain one of these boxes, called also "LV bricks"). Each DCDC converter has eight output channels. Each of these eight channels includes several outputs for three separated low voltage power systems([22]). The DCDC output channel has following specifications:

**LV power supplies for HV distributor electronics**

* +5V: 1A,
* +15V: 1A,
* -15V: 4A.

**LV power supplies for 3-in-1 cards**

* +5V: 20A,
* -5V: 10A,
* +15V: 1A.

**LV power supplies for digitisers**

* +5V: 10A,
* +3.3V: 10A.

#### 2.3.5 Patch panel

The Patch panel is located at the outer end of each super-drawer. Heavy iron pieces, called fingers, are located at the ends of the girders, where the patch panels are located. These fingers guide the return magnetic flux between the barrel and extended barrels. The patch panel itself is a desk with one handle and a set of connections, including:

* two tubes for the LCS water cooling,
* an SHV connector for the HV distribution,
* a Harting low voltage connector for all the LV consuming systems in the super-drawer,
* two optical G-links to the RODs (one is spare),
* a shielded twisted-pair multi-wire cable for the LVL1 trigger (it has got two connectors on the Figure 2.18 described as "CALO" and "MUON"),
* two optical links for the TTC distribution,
* two CAN bus systems (joined in one CAN bus cable). One controls integrator ADC card and the other one HV distribution (it has got again two connectors to enable creating the daisy-chains),
* an independent connector for internal thermometers.

Figure 2.18: A super-drawer patch panel.

#### Cooling

The electronics inside a PMT block consumes 2.5 W, without active cooling the temperature reaches a plateau at about \(30^{\circ}\)C, which is satisfactory. The power consumption inside a super-drawer is roughly 120 W for the PMT blocks, 11 W for the HV distribution and 50 W for the digitising electronics. The temperature inside the drawer is maintained by \(18^{\circ}\)C cooling water, relying on natural convection between the electronics boards. Temperatures on the chips should not exceed \(40-50^{\circ}\)C.

### 2.4 Calibration and monitoring

In order to translate calorimeter digitised signals to particle or jet energies over the duration of data-taking in ATLAS one needs to:

* determine the overall energy calibration scale, _i.e_. the factor that relates the energy deposited in the calorimeter cells to the digitised signal produced at the end of the read-out chain,
* measure this calibration factor for each read-out channel, and/or to minimise its channel-to-channel variation,
* monitor this set of calibration factors over the lifetime of the detector in order to correct for their variations in time.

The methods and tools for calibration, intercalibration and monitoring are discussed in this section.

**Methods and tools**

The signal path from particle interactions in the calorimeter to the digitised output of the physics read-out chain can be separated into three stages (see Figure 2.19):

Figure 2.19: Conceptual diagram of signal path for the calorimeter and calibration entry points (see text for definitions of the functions L and Q). For more details compare with the Figure 2.14.

1. Interactions of particles traversing the calorimeter produce ionisation in the scintillator, which eventually results in light at the PMT photocathode. This chain of processes can be characterised by a light response L=L(E,S,O), where E is the energy deposited in the calorimeter, S is the sampling fraction and O summarises the response of the optical components (scintillator and WLS fibres).
2. A light pulse L is converted into a charge at the PMT anode. This can be described by a charge response Q(\(\eta\),G,L), where \(\eta\) is the quantum efficiency and G is the gain of the PMT.
3. The physics signal, contained in the charge Q is shaped, read out and converted into digitised signal E.

The front-end physics read-out electronics (shaper\(\rightarrow\)digitiser) is intercalibrated by charge injection system (CIS) included in each 3-in-1 card. The calorimeter cells can be set to have the same response, for instance by using a test beam. This effectively intercalibrates the product of L and Q. However these two responses change in time and need to be monitored, because:

* the light yield may change due to ageing processes of the scintillators and fibres, or to radiation damage. These changes are typically slow, with time constants of hours or months,
* the PMT response may change due to gain drifts (typically occurring over hours or days), deterioration of gain or quantum efficiency (much slower except for excessive signal loads), etc.

Moreover only approximately 1/8 of all barrel and extended barrel modules will be eventually calibrated by test beam. The intercalibration and monitoring of L and Q is based on following tools:

1. a laser system producing a light pulse on each PMT which closely mimics calorimeter pulses,
2. movable radioactive Cesium sources which excite light in all scintillators by the same mechanism as particles from LHC interaction,
3. during data-taking at the LHC, continuous monitoring of the signal produced in the calorimeter by minimum bias (MB) interactions.

The laser system allows to monitor the response of the PMTs over the full dynamic range of the light signal L. In particular, it monitors the conversion from light to charge Q, and its changes in time due to gain drift. The response of the calorimeter to Cesium sources is measured by recording the average current produced in each PMT. This current is proportional to the L.Q product, Q is measured by the laser system, therefore the light response L can be obtained any time the Cesium response is measured, provided that there is a corresponding measurement of Q by the lasers.

It is of course found to have a continuous monitoring system. This will be implemented by recording the MB current, which can be done using the same electronics as during the Cesium calibration. The MB current reading-out is provided by slow charge integrator and integrator ADC and is thus independent of the data taking, which is provided by shapers and digitisers. The MB current is proportional to the instantaneous luminosity, factorising it out will give a full time record of the calorimeter overall response in time.

#### Charge injection system

The charge injection system electronics is described in chapter 2.3.3. It can calibrate either the fast pulse electronics by discharging one of its two capacitors through the shaper, or the calibration electronics by connecting the 10-bit DAC output directly to the integrator. During the test beam periods special CIS runs are taken to test the fast pulse electronics over its complete dynamic range, that is 20 fC to 800 pC. When a common physics run is taken, a fraction of the recorded events are CIS events. In this case the injected charge is usually set to a constant value, corresponding to the beam energy and particle type (so-called "monocis events").

#### Laser system

The main purpose of the laser system is to monitor the response of the PMTs on any time scale, from the very shortest (minutes) to the duration of ATLAS. The frequency-doubled YLF solid-state laser pulses closely mimic the scintillating light produced by particles in the calorimeter, having a wavelength of 480 nm and a pulse width of about 15 ns. The dynamic range of about 60,000 is reached with a set of remotely controlled neutral filters.

The laser pulse is precisely measured on a pulse-by-pulse basis by three photodiodes. The linearity of the photodiode read-out electronics is checked with a special charge injection system designed for the laser system; the response of the photodiodes is monitored with an \({}^{241}\)Am alpha source, which provides a reference stable in time and insensitive to environmental changes. The laser timing is given by an R5600 Hamamatsu PMT with a very short rise-time of 6.6 ns.

**Routing of the clear optical fibres and optical connections**

The laser system is located in the ATLAS electronics room (or in case of the test beam in the test beam control room). Laser pulses are transmitted to the modules by long clear fibres. There are two such fibres for each calorimeter module. First one transmits laser pulses for "UP" PMTs (via the 1-to-50 connector multiplication), second one for "DOWN" PMTs (see Figure 2.12 for details). Each bundle of fibres for one PMT includes one laser fibre. Two optical connections are used in the laser calibration system:

* The adjustable fibre-to-fibre connector allows to control the amplitude of transmitted light changing the distance between the fibre ends; a greater distance implies a greater light loss and a smaller amplitude of transmittedlight. The transmission as a function of the distance between the fibres is well described by an exponential with a decay constant of 2.75 mm.
* The 1-to-50 fibre connector distributes light from 1 long clear fibre entering a module to maximum 50 fibres.

There is only one laser fibre per one PMT. There is also one spare laser fibre for all Down PMTs and one for all Up PMTs. These spare fibres can be used only before the modules are assembled into the Tile Calorimeter at the ATLAS pit.

#### 2.4.3 Cesium source intercalibration and monitoring system

The Tile Calorimeter is designed to allow a movable radioactive source to pass through every scintillator tile (see Section 2.1.2.2 for details). Use of a movable \(\gamma\) source allows:

1. to check the quality of the optical response and its uniformity,
2. to equalise the response of all read-out cells, by adjusting the HV of the corresponding PMT to obtain the same average current from each cell, and
3. to monitor in time the average current of each cell, by running again the source. As the average current for each cell is proportional to the overall signal/energy calibration of the calorimeter, monitoring it allows to maintain the overall energy calibration.

In Figure 2.20 the current induced in five PMTs (reading out five consecutive cells) is shown as a function of the source position. The multiple peak structure in the response of each PMT is due to the passage of a 8 mCi \({}^{137}\)Cs source through the individual tiles. The capability to see individual tile is due to the mean free path of the \({}^{137}\)Cs gammas, which is of the order of 18 mm separation between tiles. The source scan "sees" every scintillating tile and therefore can detect broken WLS fibres or bad optical connections, which is very useful during the optical instrumentation, when bad optical components can be easily replaced.

The movable Cesium system is the main tool to equalise the response of the calorimeter read-out cells within a module, and between different modules. This so-called HV equalisation is done by adjusting the high voltage of each PMT to obtain the same average signal from each cell. HV equalisation is carried out before the start of data-taking in each test beam period.

**System requirements**

The source calibration system for the entire Tile Calorimeter must satisfy for instance following requirements:

* Installation, operation and maintenance must not produce unacceptable radiation exposure to personnel and equipment.

Figure 2.20: Current measured in the PMTs as a function of the source position along the calibration tube (z axis).

* In case the source stops anywhere on its path, it must be possible to move it to a safe location without dangerous exposure to people or equipment and without significant loss of time to ATLAS.
* neglecting interconnections, this requirement translates into a capsule velocity of at least 15 cm.s\({}^{-1}\).

The real capsule velocity during Cesium scan is \(25-30\) cm.s\({}^{-1}\). The calibration time is less than 5 h for the barrel part of the calorimeter and 3 h for the extended ones. In the testbeam area it takes about 5 min to run the source through a barrel module ([18]).

The accuracy of a single tile response evaluation is better than 2%. That leads to a sub-cell mean response accuracy close to 0.6% and 0.3% for a cell in average. The accuracy is enough to calibrate and monitor TileCal.

**Source drive**

The movement of the source capsule is maintained by a hydraulic source drive, using water as a medium. The drive liquid enters and exits the calorimeter through a number of parallel supply/return lines, connected to source circuit every 2 modules (or every 4 modules for the extended barrel). The liquid is propelled only through those 2 modules the source capsule is present in and two following ones. After the capsule passes the T-connection between these two pairs of modules, the water flux in the first pair is stopped and opened in the following pair.

**Source specifications**

As a radioactive \(\gamma\)-ray source a pill of \({}^{137}\)Cs with \(E_{\gamma}=662\) keV and \(t_{1/2}=30.2\) y was used. The dimensions of this pill do not extend 3 mm in order to enable the separate tiles differentiation in the Cs scan. The Cs pill is sealed in a little metal container, which is inserted into a capsule that travels through the calibration system pipes.

**System design for ATLAS**

In case of ATLAS the calibration system consists of three independent parts, one for barrel, one for extended barrel A and one for extended barrel C. Each of these systems has one source capsule and several source garages, where the source capsule is "parked", when the source calibration system is not operating. For other source calibration system specifications see Table 2.4.

#### Monitoring the minimum bias current

As is well known LHC detectors will have to cope with a background of inelastic proton-proton collisions at small momentum transfers, that will produce non-negligible occupancies in all detectors. These processes lead to the so-called Minimum Bias (MB) events; the associated noise in calorimeters is one of the limits on their performance. However these processes can be used to continuously monitor the response of the Tile Calorimeter.

**Concept and mode of operation**

The rate of energy deposition by MB processes has the following properties:

1. It is proportional to the LHC luminosity,
2. it is uniform in azimuthal angle,
3. it is moderately dependent on over the \(\eta\) range spanned by the Tile Calorimeter,
4. it produces a signal in the PMTs that is usually large enough to be recorded with inexpensive electronics,
5. the PMT anode current, averaged over a time scale of milliseconds, is almost constant.

Any variation of the MB current to luminosity ratio can be compared to information from the laser and Cesium source systems to understand the behaviour of the calorimeter in time and correct it. The MB current is read-out by the same calibration electronics as Cesium scan current. The MB calibration should reveal any anomalies of the MB current. Anomaly threshold is defined as 1% change of the MB currents.

**Monte Carlo simulation of MB energy deposition rates**

The mean energies deposited at each bunch crossing at different depths and pseudorapidities in the Tile Calorimeter were estimated by using a full Monte Carlo simulation of the ATLAS detector ([17]).

A luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and an inelastic cross section of 70 mb were assumed, giving 23 MB events/bunch crossing at the effective LHC bunch crossing frequency \(f=31.58\) MHz. This frequency is lower than 40 MHz, due to

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline Item & Barrel & Extended barrel \\ \hline Number of sources & 1 & 2x1 \\ Dimensions of tube section (mm) & OD=8, ID=6. & OD=8, ID=6. \\ Total length of source circuit (m) & 4270 & 2x2372 \\ Number of garages & 3 & 2x2 \\ Capsule velocity for calibration scans (cm/sec) & 25 & 25 \\ Capsule maximum velocity (cm/sec) & 50 & 50 \\ Calibration scan time (min) & 285 & 160 \\ Maximum time to reach a garage (min) & 50 & 40 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2.4: Source system specifications for the barrel and extended barrel regions (OD(ID) = outer (inner) diameter).

the fact, that some of the bunches at LHC will be empty. The mean energy depositions per bunch crossing for different modules and samplings are listed in Table 2.5.

**Estimate of minimum bias currents**

The conversion from the mean deposited energy \(E\) in a single cell to the corresponding PMT current \(I\) is obtained by:

\[I=\frac{E.k.f}{2} \tag{2.2}\]

where \(f\) is the effective LHC bunch crossing frequency, constant \(k=1.2\) pC/GeV. The factor of 2 in the denominator is introduced, because each cell, receiving the energy \(E\), is read-out by two PMTs. In case of cells in A-sampling in barrel module, one can expect about 0.15 MB signals in cell per bunch crossing, which gives a random signal with an average frequency of \(0.15\times 31.6\ MHz=4.7\) MHz. In case of cells in BC and D samplings this frequency is, of course, smaller.

#### Test beam calibration

The overall conversion factor linking the calorimeter output signal with the energy of single particles or jets is measured in testbeam, by measuring the response of barrel and extended barrel modules over the full \(\eta\) range. Measuring the Cesium response cell by cell of all calorimeter modules in ATLAS will give the information necessary to:

* correct in time the energy scale calibration of each calorimeter module, that has been exposed to the testbeam,
* "transport" to all modules the mean energy scale calibration of the modules exposed to the testbeam.

All the calorimeter modules calibrated during testbeams in the year 2002 were exposed directly to the particle beams. Following types of beams were used: muon beams, electron beams and pion beams. The pion and electron beams contain a non-negligible fraction of other particles (such as electrons, muons, smaller fraction of protons or kaons), nevertheless usually 60% or more beam particles are the "correct" ones. During the data analysis it is possible to

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline  & Barrel module & Extended barrel module \\ \hline Sampling 1 & 10-14 & 6-36 \\ Sampling 2 & 4-6 & 1.5-11.5 \\ Sampling 3 & 0.5-1.5 & 1-5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

choose more or less effectively the particles wanted, according to their physics behaviour.

Muon beams are usually more pure, containing only a small fraction of electrons (and neutrinos). This paper is about calibrating by the muon beams and electron beams.

**Testbeam area and layout**

The Tile Calorimeter testbeam facility is placed at CERN in Prevessin site on the H8 beam line. In the year 2002 three test beam periods lasting about one week took place, one in June, one in July and one in August. During each testbeam run one barrel module and two extended barrel modules are tested. All these modules were mounted onto a Module 0, that is permanently laid on a movable table, which enables 3D movements and setting the position of modules toward the beam.

All four modules (Module 0, one barrel module and two extended barrel modules) are fully equipped with front-end electronics, laser system fibres, cooling and Cesium calibration tubes. The connection for data and commands transmission between the testbeam control room and the table is provided by electrical and optical links. In July and August 2002 the laser system was not operating during the testbeam periods due to a damage of the laser itself.

The beam energy and particle type can be set on H8 beam line monitor. The particle beam is monitored upstream the calorimeter modules. Following detectors are placed upstream the modules to give information about the particles:

* three scintillating counters S1, S2 and S3,
* two Cerenkov counters, and
* two pairs of delay wire chambers. One chamber in each pair is 90 degrees rotated toward the other one. Each pair thus gives 2D information about the beam profile.

For the layout of the modules on the table see Figure 2.21.

Point "O" on the Figure 2.21 is in the same position toward the barrel modules as the bunch crossing point toward the calorimeter in ATLAS. In case of extended barrel modules this point would be shifted more to the left or right along the virtual beam line on the Figure 2.21. On the Figure 2.12 the red dashed lines show the beam direction for certain values of \(\eta\).

The beam position toward the modules at \(\theta=\pm 9\,0^{\circ}\) is visible, too. In this layout on the table the extended barrel modules are denoted as EB+ and EB-. The barrel module consists of two identical halves, each is read-out by one super-drawer. These barrel parts are denoted as B+ and B-, they are also called modules, for simplicity. In case of Module 0 its read-out units are denoted as M0+ and M0-. The EB-, B- and M0- modules are in \(\eta<0\) region, the EB+, B+ and M0+ are in \(\eta>0\) region.

\(\theta=90\) **runs**

In case of the \(\theta=\pm 90^{\circ}\) runs the beam is parallel with the \(z\)-axis. For one value Figure 2.21: The testbeam layout of modules laid on the movable table in the testbeam area. The testbeam definition of angle \(\theta\) is visible, it is different to the ATLAS definition of \(\theta\) (see Section 1.1.2). The pseudorapidity \(\eta\) can be then counted with a substitution \(\theta=\pi-\theta_{testbeam}\) used in the definition (1.1).

Figure 2.22: The movable table in the testbeam area with M0 module (bottom), barrel module and two extended barrel modules on the top.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:52]

Note: All cells in barrel negative, barrel positive part of a barrel module are read-out by the B-, B+ super-drawer, respectively. The only exception is cell D0, placed at the border of these two barrel parts. One D0 PMT is read-out by positive super-drawer, one by negative super-drawer.

Note: Cells C10 and D4 are ITC cells, but they are read-out via the extended barrel super-drawer. The sum of periods over one tilerow in whole barrel module (both positive and negative part) is 307, in extended barrel module (excluding the ITC cells) 140.

\(\eta\)**-projective runs**

In case of \(\eta\)-projective testbeam runs the beam is impinging the calorimeter modules for given value of \(\eta\) the same way as it will impinge the modules in ATLAS. The step between the values of h chosen for each module is usually chosen as \(\Delta\eta=0.1\). Due to the construction of the table and the testbeam area, the table cannot be set for all desired \(\eta\) positions for every module. The reachable values of \(\eta\) for different modules are listed in the Table 2.9.

The muon path length under certain \(\eta\) can be easily counted from the geometry of the calorimeter (Figure 2.2). The muon path lengths for different \(\eta\) are listed in the Table 2.10.

**ONLINE/OFFLINE data**

For each position of the table and given beam one run of about 50k of events is recorded (in case of lower beam intensities, this amount is smaller - 25k or 35k). One event is a response of the calorimeter module or modules on one impinging particle, unless a pile-up occurs. Each event consists of all digitised signals from all module cells, adder tower signals, so-called "muon wall" scintillating detector located behind (downstream) the modules at the table, and beam detectors signals. A fraction of events from each run is dedicated not to physics events, but to laser system calibration or monocis calibration or pedestal events. During each testbeam period several special CIS runs are taken. The information from these runs are used for the CIS front-end electronics inter-calibration. The Cesium source runs are taken usually before and after the data-taking. Sets of Cesium runs taken before the data-taking are used for the HV equalisation, the set of Cesium runs taken after the data-taking is used for stability check.

The data taken in each run are analysed in PAW programme. This programme uses its own data format - ntuples. First of all the raw data recorded in each run is processed to create so-called online ntuples. These online ntuples include about 1/5 of all events in run and do not include any calibration corrections. That also means that signals from D-sampling in barrel and from ITC cells C10 and D4 is 20% higher than in other cells. The online ntuples are used directly during the testbeams for fast analysis, whether the calorimeter modules work satisfactorily. The data from online ntuples is not a matter of this paper.

The offline ntuples, on the other hand include full statistics and calibration corrections. If the HV equalisation was done well, the only effect of applying the Cesium calibration corrections is, roughly said, that one gets a rid of the factor 1.2 for D-sampling in long barrel and ITC cells.

**Ntuple variables**

Each ntuple contains many variables, some of them are listed in the Table 2.11.

Note: The 'N0' in Module data row stands for M0- module. The notation of modules used in ntuples is in Table 2.12.

In each barrel the 64 modules are numbered 1...64. There are two notations concerning all modules of the calorimeter. In case of the first one each module is named according to the laboratory, where it was made. In case of the second notation each module is named according to ATLAS convention. Long barrel modules B+, B- are thus denoted as JINR+, JINR- (LBA,LBC) modules, EB+ modules are denoted as IFA (EBC), and EB- modules as ANL (EBA). The modules calibrated during three testbeam periods in the year 2002 are listed in the Table 2.13.

## Chapter 3 Test beam runs data analyses

All data below was analysed in PAW with the aid of kumacs I have written. All these kumacs have two versions, the first one is used for the online ntuples, which do not include CIS and Cesium corrections. These corrections are added into this first version of kumacs. These kumacs can be used during the testbeam periods to speed up the online data analyses.

The second version of kumacs is used for the offline analyses below and uses offline ntuples, which already include all Tilecal calibration systems corrections (apart from Laser system correction - exception in the year 2002 because of broken laser).

### 3.1 Muons at \(\theta=\pm 90\).

#### Cesium and CIS corrections

As was already mentioned, the Tile Calorimeter has got three calibration systems to calibrate and intercalibrate its channels: Laser, Cesium and Charge Injection system. During 2002 testbeam periods the laser system was not operating. Offline ntuples including only Cesium and CIS corrections were used for the data presented in sections below.

Cesium corrections are a result of HV equalisation based on \({}^{137}\)Cs scan - an intercalibration of calorimeter cells. But as the signals during Cs scans are read out by calibration electronics, the fast pulse electronics has to be calibrated separately. CIS corrections are results of calibration of fast pulse electronics.

#### June 2002 testbeam runs

Muon beams contain also a fraction of electrons, but in general muon beams are more pure than electron beams. No special cuts for selecting muons are needed, because electrons deposit usually all their energy in a module, while muons deposit only a few GeV1. The only cuts used for muons were cuts forbeam profile:

* \(-25<xcha1-xcha2<25\),
* \(-25<ycha1-ycha2<25\).

The muon spectra (Figure 3.1) were fit according to [7] by Gauss-Landau convolution. Gaussian smearing of Landau muon response is caused by noise in read-out chains.

In each tilerow responses of all channels reading-out that tilerow were fit. The most probable value (MOP) of each Landau spectra is usually equal to \(\sim 0.5-1.5\) pC2. The value itself depends on size of each cell. Longer cells (cells including higher number of periods) give higher response. In order to enable comparison of responses of all channels in all tilerows, the MOPs were divided by a correct number of periods (Tables 2.6, 2.7 and 2.8) - the response is thus normalised as \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\) per period per one channel. A summary plot of normalised MOPs was made for each tilerow (Figure 3.2) of each module.

Footnote 2: One goal of Tilecal design was to reach the average conversion factor of 1.2 pC/GeV. That means following: if particle traversing the calorimeter deposits energy of 1 GeV in its cells, than the sum of resulting charges on its PMT anodes should be equal to 1.2 pC.

Plots on Figure 3.3 show histograms of MOPs of whole module and of separate samplings of the module. The upper plot on Figure 3.4 shows uniformity of MOPs in each tilerow. The best value below 3% is achieved in last two tilerows #10 and #11. These tilerows include only 7 channels and largest cells of the whole module. The bottom plot on the same Figure shows muon energy loss throughout tilerows, the average loss is \(3.83\pm 0.30\) pC. The bottom plot on the Figure 3.5 shows summary of all channels in the module. If MOP in any sub-cell read-out by a chosen channel is out of interval \(8-18\) fC/per, than this channel is denoted as a _bad channel_. All such bad channels in June are listed in Table 3.1.

In Table 3.2 the most important values for modules calibrated in June are listed.

#### 3.1.5 Conclusions

Muons at \(\theta=\pm 90\) are an effective source of information for comparison of all the channels in the calorimeter. As muon beam penetrates through the whole mass of each calorimeter module, the response of each channel and the module response uniformity are easy to evaluate. During the ONLINE data analysis performed during the testbeam, with the aid of muons at \(\theta=\pm 90\), bad or broken channels in a tested module can be quickly found. This is worth, because during the testbeam periods, there is only a little spare time. Macros written for evaluating the muon \(\theta=\pm 90\) testbeam data speed up this evaluation.

### Muons \(\eta\)-projective

In case of muon \(\eta\)-projective runs, the beam was approximately set in the direction of trigger tower axises. This geometrical set-up corresponds to the real situation in ATLAS - muons are entering the calorimeter from the direction of beam-crossing.

When evaluating muons \(\eta\)-projective data, signals from cells belonging to one trigger tower were summed up and then normalised for muon path length for each value of pseudorapidity. In case of the lowest values of \(\eta=\pm 0.05\) a special corrections had to be done, in order to obtain typical Gauss-Landau muon spectra.

#### 3.2.1 Channelling for low values of \(\eta\)

As was already mentioned above, the response of the calorimeter for muons depends on the path length of muons through the calorimeter. To be precise, the muon response depends on the muon path length through the scintillating tiles. The muon beam has got its own width of several centimeters and after using cuts for beam profile3, one still uses beam of dimensions \(40\times 40\) mm\({}^{2}\). For larger values of \(\eta\) (\(|\eta|>0.25\)) the muon path length through scintillating tiles does not effectively depend on the distance of the particle from the beam axis (_i.e._ on the ntuple parameters _ximp_ and _yimp_), see Figures 3.6 and 3.7, but for smaller values of \(\eta\) (\(\eta\leq 0.25\)) this dependence is significant (see Figure 3.8) and the muon response spectrum ceases to have its typical Gauss-Landau shape (Figure 3.9).

Footnote 3: \(-20<xcha1-xcha2<20\), \(-20<ycha1-ycha2<20\).

The dependence in Figure 3.8 is fitted by sine function. The reason for sine is, that it is a simple periodical function and we do not have more precise description of this so-called "channelling" effect. In order to get a rid of this channelling effect and to enable comparison of response for \(\eta=\pm 0.05\) with the rest of \(\eta\)-projective runs, the simplest thing to do is to divide the dependence in Figure 3.8 by the values of the fitted sine function and multiply the result by mean values of that sine. In other words instead of using command:

\[[\text{en}]\%\text{ximp}\]

one uses

\[[\text{en}]/\text{sinus}(\text{ximp})\,{}^{*}P4\%\text{ximp},\]

where \([\text{en}]\) denotes the sum of signal from cells in a trigger tower for chosen \(\eta\), \(\text{par}(4)\) is the mean values of the sine fit and \(\text{sinus}(\text{ximp})\)4

Footnote 4: The parameters \(P1\), \(P2\), \(P3\) and \(P4\) correspond to the sinus function as follows:

\[\text{sinus}=P4*(P1*\text{sin}(2*\pi*(x+P3)/P2)+1) \tag{3.1}\]

In Figure 3.10 one can see the effect of this step. Obtained dependence \([\text{en}]=[\text{en}](\text{ximp})\) is, of course, more flat, than it was. Important effect is reached on the shape of the energy spectrum with such corrections - see Figure 3.11.

Figure 3.7: The dependence of energy response of the module B+, June, \(\eta=0.15\) on _ximp_ parameter. This dependence still does not reflect the periodical structure of modules dramatically.

Figure 3.6: The dependence of energy response of the module B+, June, \(\eta=0.25\) on _ximp_ parameter. The value of _ximp_ denotes the distance of a particle from the beam axis, it is counted from parameters _xcha1_ and _xcha2_. This dependence is more or less flat, because for higher values of \(\eta\) the muon path length in scintillators is up to a certain precision same for all _ximp_ values.

Figure 3.8: The dependence of energy response of the module B+, June, \(\eta=0.05\) on _imp_ parameter. In this case the periodical structure of Tile Cal modules is clearly visible. The upper peak of this dependence corresponds to muons, which traversed longer path through scintillating tiles, than muons in lower peaks of this dependence. Muons in these lower peaks traversed more iron. The maximum and minimum values in this dependence differ almost by a factor of 2. For a correct evaluation of muon energy deposition in Tilecal for small values of \(\eta\) a precise information about its track coordinates is neccesary.

Figure 3.10: This dependence of energy response on _ximp_ parameter was counted from the dependence in Figure 3.8 by simple applying of the factor \(P4/sin(ximp)\).

Figure 3.9: The energy spectrum of response for the module B+, June, \(\eta=0.05\). This spectrum clearly does not have the Gauss-Landau shape. The right peak corresponds to the muons, that traversed longer path through the scintillator and shorter path through iron, than muons in the left peak.

The corrections for channelling effect were done for all runs for \(\eta=\pm 0.05\) in all three months.

#### Muon path length normalisation

In Figure 3.12 The values of MOPs of the spectra of energy response for muon beam for all measured values of \(\eta\) are plotted. Of course these values depend on the muon path length through the calorimeter. One can compare the Figure 3.12 with Figure 2.23, where these muon path length are plotted. In order to compare the responses of muons for different \(\eta\) values, the MOPs in Figure 3.12 are normalised to the path length. It is made the same way as in the case of muons \(\theta=\pm 90^{\circ}\): the normalised unit is _fC per one period per one PMT (fC/per)_. Before this normalisation was made, the responses for \(\eta=\pm 0.05\) were corrected by the factor \(P4/sinus(ximp)\).

#### June 2002 testbeam runs

The list of bad channels is shown in Table 3.7. The path length normalised response is shown in Figure 3.13.

#### July 2002 testbeam runs

The list of bad channels is shown in Table 3.8. The path length normalised response is shown in Figure 3.14.

#### 3.2.5 August 2002 testbeam runs

The list of bad channels is shown in Table 3.9. The path length normalised response is shown in Figure 3.15.

#### 3.2.6 Conclusions

Analysis of muon \(\eta\)-projective data shown, that the uniformity of response for higher values of pseudorapidity (\(\eta\geq 0.15\)) is better than \(5\%\), which is satisfying. The average muon energy deposition is in range of \(14-15\) IC/per.

On the other hand the uniformity of muon response for small pseudorapidity values (\(|\eta|<0.05\)) is not satisfying. The dependence of muon signal on \(ximp\) parameter is almost \(100\%\). The muons, that passed through more scintillator material and less iron give almost twice as big signal than other muons. But muons, that give smaller signal (about \(2\) pC MOP value in whole trigger tower for \(|\eta|=0.05\)) had to pass more iron, than muons with higher signal, and thus lose more energy \(-\) see Table 1.1 for material parameters. In order to correct this

response a track coordinates of muon path through calorimeter with precision better than 1 mm are necessary.

In Figure 3.16 the normalised MOPs of muons response for extended barrel module in ONLINE analyses in August are shown. The mean muon energy deposition in EB- is \(15.59\)\(\mathrm{f\kern-0.8ptC}\)/per. That is a higher value than is usual (\(\approx 13-14\)\(\mathrm{f\kern-0.8ptC}\)/per). The higher response of EB- in August was also shown in online analyses for muons at \(\theta=\pm 9\,0^{\circ}\) and for all electrons. This was one of the hints for reprocessing the Cesium corrections. In offline data the Cesium corrections are counted correctly and the mean response of EB- is similar to other modules.

### 3.3 Electrons in August 2002

#### Electron cuts

When analysing muon beam runs data, the situation with identification of muons is quite simple. Muon beams are usually quite pure (they contain a small fraction of electrons) and the only cuts that were used were beam profile cuts (the divergent particles in beam do not have well defined value of their impulse, and, what is more important, one would like the particles to enter the modules only in a small area. That is why these divergent particles are cut out).

On contrary, electron beams are not pure electrons at all. In some cases only about 40% of particles in "electron" beam are electrons. The rest are pions and muons. In such case suitable "electron cuts" for identifying electron events play an important role. Some of these cuts differ for higher and lower energies (180 GeV and 20 GeV).

Figure 3.16: The normalised MOPs of muon response of extended barrel modules in ONLINE analyses in August.

#### 3.3.1.1 180 GeV electron cuts

As an example of application of electron cuts for 180 GeV run with \(\theta=90^{\circ}\), B+, tilero 5 was chosen. The response (in pC) of the calorimeter (it is a sum of signals from cells B\(6-\)B9) without cuts is shown on Figure 3.17.

It is interesting, that the signal from pions (middle peak) is lower than from electrons (right-hand side peak). This has two reasons. Firstly, the energy spectrum in the Figure 3.17 is a sum of signals of four cells. Pion shower exceeds this region. Secondly, it is the consequence of the non-compensation of the calorimeter.

However, for energy of 180 GeV one has a powerful tool to distinguish electrons. It is the longitudinal shower profile cut. Electrons with a certain impulse do not penetrate such amount of material as pions (or muons, of course). In our example (tilero 5), the most of electrons deposit their energy in first three cells they enter (B\(9-\)B7), while other particles deposit some energy in next cells as well (B6, _etc_). The ratio of energy deposited in first three cells and energy deposited in first four cells (B\(9-\)B6) is shown in Figure 3.18 and more detailed in Figure 3.19. The peak with mean value \(\approx 1\) is caused by electrons. The left tail of this peak in Figure 3.18 is caused by other particles. The longitudinal shower profile cut is different for each run due to the cell layout in the module.

Other cuts that were used for this energy are beam cuts (Figures 3.20 and 3.21) to get a rid of divergent particles with not well defined impulse, and cuts for scintillator counter S2 to get a rid of particles, that gave too high signal in

Figure 3.17: The response of module B+, tilero 5, \(\theta=90^{\circ}\). Values on \(x\)-axis are in pC. The peak on the left-hand side (mean value \(\approx 0\) pC) is caused by muons. The peak in the middle (mean value \(\approx 170\) pC) is caused by pions and the peak on the right-hand side (mean value \(\approx 215\) pC) is caused by electrons.

this counter - these particles may have lost part of their energy before entering the calorimeter.

The final response after applying all cuts mentioned above is shown in Figure 3.23. The dark peak are the desired electrons. Other electron spectra are also shown in Figure 3.24. If the cut is successful, the resulting spectrum has got a Gaussian shape. Other such spectra are available for all electron runs in the directory:

#### 3.3.1.2 20 GeV electron cuts

In case of 20 GeV electrons the longitudinal shower profile cut can not be used effectively, because the energy of impinging particles is too low. 20 GeV pions do not penetrate significantly further than the first cell, they enter. But for this energy another cut can be effectively used. It is the Cerenkov counter. Of all particles contained in the beam (apart from neutrinos), electrons are the lightest and have the highest value of \(\beta\). Electrons then give the highest signal in Cerenkov counters that are placed upstream from the calorimeter (see Figure 3.25). For 20 GeV electrons the beam profile cuts are used as well. The effect of all cuts is shown in Figure 3.26.

Electron spectra of all 20 GeV runs are available in the directory:

The mean values of Gaussian fits of the electron spectra are shown in Figures 3.27 and 3.28. The set of bad channels is listed in Table 3.10. When a channel is classified as a bad channel, signals from its cell partner are used doubled, instead of using the sum of signals from both channels of one cell. _Two_ bad channels in _one_ cell have not appeared during testbeam periods analysed in this paper.

## Chapter 4 Conclusions

In this chapter a summary of the work presented in this paper is given.

In Chapter 1 some of the basic features and variables in calorimetry were defined. In Chapter 2 a description of the Tile Calorimeter detector was given. A special attention was given to provide the most up-to-date information about the calorimeter design. In this Chapter the calibration systems of Tilecal and the Test beam facility were described as well.

In Chapter 3 results of analyses of muon \(\theta=\pm\,90^{\circ}\) and muon \(\eta\)-projective runs taken during three test beam periods in summer 2002 as well as results of analyses of electron runs taken in August 2002 were showed.

Muons at \(\theta=\pm 90^{\circ}\) represent a powerful diagnostic tool for checking the status of all channels in a module. \(\eta\)-projective muons and electrons give results important for Tilecal calibration in ATLAS, and also verify good results of Cesium calibrations and HV equalisations.

The author of this paper participated both online and offline analyses of the test beam data and wrote macros in PAW for each group of runs analysed in this paper to facilitate both kinds of analyses.

The author of this paper gained also some experience with hardware of TileCal detector and with data-taking during testbeam periods at CERN.

Results of data analyses were presented during TileCal week in October 2002 at CERN and during Tilecal video conference in January 2003. Brief results of muon \(\theta=\pm 90^{\circ}\) runs analyses are available also in TileCal Muon calibration database ([http://tileinfo.web.cern.ch/tileinfo/muselect.php](http://tileinfo.web.cern.ch/tileinfo/muselect.php)) and detailed results of all analyses are available in the Database of Test beam analysis on following web site: [http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/SUB_DETECTORS/TILE/testbeam/TBDB/main.html](http://atlas.web.cern.ch/Atlas/SUB_DETECTORS/TILE/testbeam/TBDB/main.html).

	* 2.1 Tile Calorimeter within ATLAS.
	* 2.2 Cross section of the Tile Calorimeter cut on the line of symmetry at z=0. Definition of R, z and \(\theta\) is illustrated. "0" denotes the interaction point. Drawing not to scale.
	* 2.3 The calorimeter barrels (green) and the crack and gap scintillators (red).
	* 2.4 The barrel module. 18 standard sub-modules and 1 special sub-module in a row bolted onto the support girder (bottom of the module). In front one of the dark blue end-plates is visible. Note that the closer half of the module is already instrumented with optical fibres (details in chapter 2.2).
	* 2.5 A side-view of a standard sub-module (top). There are glued spacers (white trapezoids in the picture) on both masters (middle and bottom). These two half-periods form one full 18 mm thick period. Scintillating tiles (light blue on both half-periods) are numbered \(1-11\).
	* 2.6 Two barrel modules cut in the middle plane of symmetry and the system of calibration tubes that runs eleven times through each module.
	* 2.7 The barrel girder. On the right side of the left girder the holes for optical fibres are visible.
	* 2.8 The metal drawer shell is the mechanical support structure for one drawer. 24 cylindrical holes for PMT blocks are visible.
	* 2.9 Main optical elements of the Tile Calorimeter, cross-section of module - tiles (light blue and yellow) only in one half-period are visible. In this case two tiles number 1 and 3 belonging to one cell are read-out at their edges by two optical fibres (yellow) ending at photocathodes of two PMTs (light brown) in the girder. Particles are entering from right-hand side. Each optical fibre reads out one or two tiles at one of their free edges at once.
2.10 Drawing of a trapezoidal shaped tile. Two holes in the central part are visible. One of them is used for the Cesium source calibration pipe. The second one is used for mechanical connection of the tile and module iron structure.
2.11 Fibre bundles inserted into the holes in the girder. The light mixers and PMTs are placed right behind these holes inside the girder. In the upper part of the picture a 1-to-50 connector for laser fibres is visible. One of these clear fibres is joining the middle bundle. Clear fibres in the left bundle are exceptionally not wave-length shifters, they are a connection to gap and crack scintillators.
2.12 Cell to PMT map.
2.13 A side view of about one half of a barrel module instrumented by fibres, grouped into bundles, each reading out one side of a read-out cell. The numbered cells are visible.
2.14 General scheme of the Tile Calorimeter Read-out.
2.15 The PMT block
2.16 Location of the super-drawers in the Tile Calorimeter, showing access possibilities.
2.17 Organisation of the super-drawer electronics.
2.18 A super-drawer patch panel.
2.19 Conceptual diagram of signal path for the calorimeter and calibration entry points (see text for definitions of the functions L and Q). For more details compare with the Figure 2.14.
2.20 Current measured in the PMTs as a function of the source position along the calibration tube (z axis).
2.21 The testbeam layout of modules laid on the movable table in the testbeam area. The testbeam definition of angle \(\theta\) is visible, it is different to the ATLAS definition of \(\theta\) (see Section 1.1.2). The pseudorapidity \(\eta\) can be then counted with a substitution \(\theta=\pi-\theta_{testbeam}\) used in the definition (1.1).
2.22 The movable table in the testbeam area with M0 module (bottom), barrel module and two extended barrel modules on the top.
2.23 Muon paths length (cm) for different \(\eta\) and modules tested at the table during one testbeam run.
3.1 Gauss\(\otimes\)Landau convolution fit of muon spectra for chosen channels in June B-, tilerow 11.
3.2 Summary plot of normalised MOPs, tilerow 4, LBA34. (Top) MOPs of all channels in tilerow 4. Red square above any channel signalises, that difference between that channel and average over all channels in the tilerow is higher than 10%. The average value of MOPs over whole tilerow is 13.72 fC/per. Apparently, channel #17 does not work correctly, it gives too low signal. (Bottom) Errors of MOPs. Red square is used for errors more than 30% higher than the average error.

Histograms of MOPs of whole module (top left), sampling 1 (top right), sampling 2 (bottom left) and sampling 3 (bottom right).
* 3.4 (Top)Uniformity of MOPs in each tilerow. Solid line drawn at average value. (Bottom) Average muon energy loss throughout tilerows. Solid line drawn at average value.
* 3.5 (Top) Histogram of muon energy loss throughout tilerows. (Bottom) Summary of all channels in the module. For each channel average value of MOPs over all sub-cells it reads out is plotted. Blue cross above any channel signalises, that the MOP in any sub-cell read out by this channel is out of interval \(8-18\) fC/per. Such channels are denoted as _bad_ or _broken_ channels. Channel #17 is apparently bad.
* 3.6 The dependence of energy response of the module B+, June, \(\eta=0.25\) on _ximp_ parameter. The value of _ximp_ denotes the distance of a particle from the beam axis, it is counted from parameters _xcha1_ and _xcha2_. This dependence is more or less flat, because for higher values of \(\eta\) the muon path length in scintillators is up to a certain precision same for all _ximp_ values.
* 3.7 The dependence of energy response of the module B+, June, \(\eta=0.15\) on _ximp_ parameter. This dependence still does not reflect the periodical structure of modules dramatically.
* 3.8 The dependence of energy response of the module B+, June, \(\eta=0.05\) on _imp_ parameter. In this case the periodical structure of Tile Cal modules is clearly visible. The upper peak of this dependence corresponds to muons, which traversed longer path through scintillating tiles, than muons in lower peaks of this dependence. Muons in these lower peaks traversed more iron. The maximum and minimum values in this dependence differ almost by a factor of 2. For a correct evaluation of muon energy deposition in Tilecal for small values of \(\eta\) a precise information about its track coordinates is neccesary.
* 3.9 The energy spectrum of response for the module B+, June, \(\eta=0.05\). This spectrum clearly does not have the Gauss-Landau shape. The right peak corresponds to the muons, that traversed longer path through the scintillator and shorter path through iron, than muons in the left peak.
* 3.10 This dependence of energy response on _ximp_ parameter was counted from the dependence in Figure 3.8 by simple applying of the factor \(P4/sin(ximp)\).
* 3.11 This energy spectrum was counted from the spectrum in Figure 3.9 by simple applying of the factor \(P4/sin(ximp)\). The MOP of this spectrum was used for further evaluation of the module response.
* 3.12 The values of MOPs of the spectra of energy response for muon beam for all measured values of \(\eta\) for all four modules measured during one testbeam period.

3.13 The plot of path length normalised MOPs of muon response of the barrel module calibrated in June 2002. Muon \(\eta\)-projective runs for extended barrel modules were not measured in June. The mean values of energy deposition and uniformity of response for each module are also shown (In this case "module" means that part of a barrel module, that is read-out by one supper-drawer, that is B+ or B-.).

3.17 The response of module B+, tilerow 5, \(\theta=90^{\circ}\). Values on \(x\)-axis are in pC. The peak on the left-hand side (mean value \(\approx 0\) pC) is caused by muons. The peak in the middle (mean value \(\approx 170\) pC) is caused by pions and the peak on the right-hand side (mean value \(\approx 215\) pC) is caused by electrons.
