**Abstract**

The ATLAS experiment sensitivity to Flavour Changing Neutral Currents top decays (\(t\to qZ\), \(t\to q\gamma\) and \(t\to qg\)) was studied. Different analyses, corresponding to the \(t\bar{t}\) production at LHC and subsequent \(t(\bar{t})\to bW\) and \(\bar{t}(t)\to qX\) (\(X=Z,\gamma,g\)) decays are presented. The branching ratio sensitivity (assuming a \(5\sigma\) signal significance) and \(95\%\) confidence level limits on the branching ratio (in the hypothesis of signal absence) were obtained.

Flavour Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) are strongly suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism [1]. Although absent at tree level, small FCNC contributions are expected at one loop level, according to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix [2]. In the top quark sector of the SM, these contributions limit the FCNC decay branching ratios to the gauge bosons, \(BR_{t\to qX}\) (\(X=Z,\gamma,g\)), to below \(10^{-10}\). There are however extensions of the SM, like super symmetric (SUSY) [3], multi-Higgs doublet models [4] and SM extensions with exotic (vector-like) quarks [5], which predict the presence of FCNC contributions already at tree level and significantly enhance the FCNC decay branching ratios compared to the SM predictions.

Due to its large mass, much higher than any other known fermion, the top quark is a very good laboratory to look for physics beyond the SM. If, however, the top quark has FCNC anomalous couplings to the gauge bosons, its decay properties would be affected, and possibly measured at colliders, in addition to the dominant decay mode \(t\to bW\). Indeed one of the most prominent signatures of FCNC processes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), would be the direct observation of a top quark decaying into a charm or an up quark together with a \(\gamma,g\) or \(Z\) boson. In the effective Lagrangian approach [6, 7] the new top quark decay rates to the gauge bosons,

\[\Gamma(t\to qg) = \left(\frac{\kappa_{tq}^{g}}{\Lambda}\right)^{2}\frac{8}{3} \alpha_{s}m_{t}^{3}\qquad,\qquad\Gamma(t\to q\gamma)=\left(\frac{\kappa_{tq}^ {\gamma}}{\Lambda}\right)^{2}2\alpha m_{t}^{3}, \tag{1}\] \[\Gamma(t\to qZ)_{\gamma} = \left(|v_{tq}^{Z}|^{2}+|a_{tq}^{Z}|^{2}\right)\alpha m_{t}^{3} \frac{1}{4M_{Z}^{2}\sin^{2}2\theta_{W}}\left(1-\frac{M_{Z}^{2}}{m_{t}^{2}} \right)^{2}\left(1+2\frac{M_{Z}^{2}}{m_{t}^{2}}\right),\] (2) \[\Gamma(t\to qZ)_{\sigma} = \left(\frac{\kappa_{tq}^{Z}}{\Lambda}\right)^{2}\alpha\,m_{t}^{3} \frac{1}{\sin^{2}2\theta_{W}}\left(1-\frac{M_{Z}^{2}}{m_{t}^{2}}\right)^{2} \left(2+\frac{M_{Z}^{2}}{m_{t}^{2}}\right), \tag{3}\]

can be expressed in terms of the \(\kappa_{tq}^{g}\), \(\kappa_{tq}^{\gamma}\), (\(|v_{tq}^{Z}|^{2}+|a_{tq}^{Z}|^{2}\)) and \(\kappa_{tq}^{Z}\) anomalous couplings to the \(g\), \(\gamma\) and \(Z\) bosons respectively. The energy scale associated with this new physics is represented by \(\Lambda\), while \(\alpha_{s}\) and \(\alpha\) are, respectively, the strong and electromagnetic coupling constants. The electroweak mixing angle is represented by \(\theta_{W}\) and the top and \(Z\) masses are represented, respectively, by \(m_{t}\) and \(M_{Z}\).

Although FCNC processes associated with the production [8, 9] and decay [10] of top quarks have been studied at colliders (\(BR_{t\to Zu(c)}<33\%\) and \(BR_{t\rightarrow\gamma u(c)}<3.2\%\)) [10]), the amount of data collected up to now is not comparable with the statistics expected at the LHC. With a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and a design luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), the LHC will be a "top factory", with a \(t\bar{t}\) production cross section of 833 pb and 250 pb for single top production. About 80,000 top pairs will be produced per day and per experiment, at nominal luminosity, through gluon fusion (\(gg\to t\bar{t}\)) and quark-antiquark annihilation (\(q\bar{q}\to t\bar{t}\)).

This paper is devoted to the study of the ATLAS experiment sensitivity [11] for the FCNC top quark decays, produced at LHC according to \(gg,q\bar{q}\to t\bar{t}\). While one of the top quarks is expected to follow the dominant SM decay channel (\(t\to bW\)), the other decays through a FCNC channel, _i.e._\(t\to Zu(c)\), \(t\rightarrow\gamma u(c)\) or \(t\to gu(c)\). Only the leptonic decays of the \(W\) (from the SM top decay) and \(Z\) (from the anomalous top decay) bosons are considered.

This paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, a description of the signal and background is performed in section 2. The analysis criteria for the different channels under study are described in section 3 and in section 4 the results are presented in two different ways: the branching ratio sensitivities assuming a \(5\sigma\) significance discovery and \(95\%\) confidence level limits in the hypothesis of signal absence. These results are compared with previously published ones [12, 13, 14] in section 5.

## 2 Signal and background simulation

The Monte Carlo (MC) generation of the QCD (\(b\bar{b}\)), \(W\)+jets, \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)+jets, \(WW\), \(ZZ\) and \(ZW\) background processes was done with the library PYTHIA 6.206 [15]. The pair (\(t\bar{t}_{SM}\)) and single top production SM channels were generated using TopReX 4.05 [16]. TopReX was also used to generate signal \(t\bar{t}\) samples, where the \(t\)-quark decays via Charged Currents (CC) into \(bW\) and the \(\bar{t}\)-quark decays through FCNC into \(qZ\), \(q\gamma\) or \(qg\). The anomalous couplings to the \(g\), \(\gamma\) and \(Z\) bosons were set to \(\kappa_{tq}^{g}=\kappa_{tq}^{\gamma}=(|v_{t}^{2}|^{2}+|a_{t}^{2}|^{2})^{1/2}= \kappa_{tq}^{Z}=0.1\) and \(\Lambda\) was set to 1 TeV. Both background and signal simulated events were passed through the ATLAS fast simulation ATLFAST 2.53 [17] and ATLFASTB packages. The \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency was set to \(60\%\) (the rejection factor of \(c\)-jets is 10 and of light quarks jets 100). The charged lepton identification efficiency is \(90\%\). Initial State Radiation (ISR) and Final State Radiation (FSR) were both taken into account in the event generation. The CTEQ5L Parton Distribution Functions (PDF) were used [15, 16]. Results were extracted for a luminosity of \(L=10\) and \(100\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 3 Topologies and event selection

The final states corresponding to different FCNC top decay channels lead to different topologies according to the number of jets, leptons and photons. There is however a common characteristic of all channels under study, _i.e._ in all of them one of the top quarks is assumed to decay through the dominant SM decay mode \(t\to bW\to b\ell\nu_{\ell}\). This fact allowed to define a general selection criteria: events were required to have at least one lepton1 with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV/\(c\) and two jets with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV/\(c\) in the final state. Both the lepton and the jets were required to have \(|\eta|<2.5\). Additionally, the transverse missing momentum (\(p_{T_{miss}}\)) had to be greater than 20 GeV/\(c\). Following these general criteria, events were classified into different channels corresponding to the FCNC top decays \(\bar{t}(t)\to qZ\), \(\bar{t}(t)\to q\gamma\) and \(\bar{t}(t)\to qg\). Specific preselection and final selection criteria were applied for each channel, as described below.

Footnote 1: Only isolated leptons and photons were considered. The isolation criteria requires the absence of additional tracks with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV/\(c\) inside a cone of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}=0.4\) around the lepton (photon) direction.

### \(t\to Zu(c)\) channel

The final states corresponding to these signal events are characterized by a topology with two jets (one \(b\)-jet from the SM top decay), three leptons (two of them from the \(Z\) decay) and missing transverse momentum from the undetected neutrino.

At the preselection, events were accepted if they had at least two additional leptons with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\). The number of background events (normalized to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) and the signal efficiency (convoluted with \(BR_{W\to\ell\nu}\) and \(BR_{Z\to\ell\ell}\)) are shown in Table 1. The distribution of relevant variables at this level are shown in Fig. 1.

The final event selection was done by requiring the leading jet to have \(p_{T}>30\) GeV/\(c\) (in this paper jets, leptons and photons are ordered by decreasing values of \(p_{T}\), _i.e._ the leading particle is the one with highest \(p_{T}\)). One of the jets had to be tagged as a \(b\)-jet (only one \(b\)-jet was allowed). Additionally, in order to be compatible with the \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) decay, two of the three leptons present in the final state were required to have opposite charges and the same flavour, _i.e._\(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}=e^{+}e^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). The number of selected SM events and the signal efficiency at the final selection level are shown in Table 1. The dominant contribution for the single top background is the \(t\)-channel.

The reconstruction of the \(Z\) mass was done by calculating the \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) invariant mass2\((m_{\ell^{+}\ell^{-}})\) and is shown in Fig. 2a. The \(\bar{t}\) mass (\(m_{j\ell^{+}\ell^{-}}\)) reconstruction was done by associating the non-\(b\) jet with the \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) pair. If more than one non-\(b\) jet was present, the one with highest \(p_{T}\) was chosen. The signal and SM distribution of \(m_{j\ell^{+}\ell^{-}}\) is shown in Fig. 2b. The semileptonic \(t\)-quark decay (\(t\to b\ell\nu\)) cannot be directly reconstructed due to the presence of an undetected neutrino in the final state. Nevertheless, the neutrino four-momentum can be estimated by assuming the transverse missing energy to be the transverse neutrino momentum. The longitudinal component can be determined, with a quadratic ambiguity, by constraining the \(W\) mass (calculated as the invariant mass of the neutrino and the most energetic remaining lepton) to its known central value (\(m_{W}=80.4\) GeV/\(c^{2}\)[18]). The \(t\) mass, shown in Fig. 2c, was reconstructed by associating the \(b\)-jet with the reconstructed \(W\). The quadratic ambiguity was removed by choosing the solution closer to \(m_{t}=175\) GeV/\(c^{2}\).

Footnote 2: In the case where more than one pair of leptons had the same flavour and opposite charges, the pair with highest \(p_{t}\) was chosen.

Following the final selection, a probabilistic type of analysis was applied. Signal (\({\cal P}_{i}^{signal}\)) and background-like (\({\cal P}_{i}^{back.}\)) probabilities were computed using Probability Density Functions (p.d.f.), constructed from relevant physical variables. The signal \({\cal L}_{S}=\Pi_{i=1}^{n}P_{i}^{signal}\) and background \({\cal L}_{B}=\Pi_{i=1}^{n}P_{i}^{back.}\) likelihoods (\(n\) is the number of p.d.f.) were used to built the discriminant variable, defined as \(L_{R}={\cal L}_{S}/{\cal L}_{B}\).

For the \(t\to Zu(c)\) channel the p.d.f. were based on the following physical distributions (_c.f._ Fig. 3):

* minimum invariant mass (\(m_{\ell_{i}\ell_{j}}\)) of the three possible combinations of two leptons (only the three leading leptons were considered);
* transverse momentum of the third lepton (\(p_{Tl3}\));
* the \(j\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) invariant mass and * the transverse momentum of the most energetic non-\(b\) jet (\(p_{Tj}\)).

The \(L_{R}\) distributions for SM background and signal are shown after the final selection in Fig. 4.

### \(t\to\gamma u(c)\) channel

The final states corresponding to these signal events are characterized by a topology with two jets (one \(b\)-jet from the SM top decay), one photon, one lepton and missing transverse momentum from the undetected neutrino.

At the preselection, events were required to have at least one photon with \(p_{T}>50\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Additionally, in order to prevent events to be simultaneously assigned to the \(t\to Zu(c)\) and \(t\to\gamma u(c)\) channels, a maximum of two leptons in the final state were allowed. The number of selected SM background events and the signal efficiency at the preselection level are shown in Table 2. The distributions of relevant variables for SM background and signal are shown in Fig. 5.

The final event selection was done by requiring the leading photon to have \(p_{T}>75\) GeV/\(c\) and one (and only one) of the two leading jets to be tagged as a \(b\)-jet. This selection largely reduces the background, being \(t\bar{t}_{SM}\) the dominant contribution, as can be seen in Table 2. The FCNC top decay was reconstructed using the non-\(b\) jet and the photon (in the cases were more than one photon or non-\(b\) quark were available, the one with higher \(p_{T}\) was chosen).

Just like for the \(t\to Zu(c)\) channel, a probabilistic type of analysis was used. The p.d.f. were built based on the following variables (_c.f._ Fig. 6):

* the \(\bar{t}\) mass reconstructed from the photon and the non-\(b\) jet four-momenta (\(m_{j\gamma}\));
* the transverse momentum of the leading photon (\(p_{T_{\gamma}}\)) and
* the number of jets.

The discriminant variables distributions for signal and SM expectation are shown in Fig. 7.

### \(t\to gu(c)\) channel

The final state to this channel is characterized by the existence of at least three jets (one \(b\)-jet from the SM top decay), one lepton and missing transverse momentum from the undetected neutrino. As in this topology the FCNC top decay corresponds to a fully

hadronic final state, a more restrictive event selection was needed. At the preselection, events were required to have only one lepton and no photons with transverse momentum above \(p_{T}>5\) GeV/\(c\), to reject events assigned to the other FCNC channels. The total visible energy had to be greater than 300 GeV. At least three jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{T}>20\) GeV/\(c\) were required. For the leading jet the cut was increased to 40 GeV/\(c\). The events were then classified as "3 jets" or "4 jets" if they had three jets or at least 4 jets, respectively.

#### 3.3.1 "3 jets" sample

The preselection was completed by requiring only one \(b\)-tagged jet in the event. The gluon jet was assumed to be the non-\(b\) jet with the highest transverse momentum. This distribution is shown in Fig. 8, together with the \(\bar{t}\) mass (\(m_{\bar{t}}\)), reconstructed from the non-\(b\) jets. The \(t\) mass (\(m_{t}\), reconstructed according to section 3.1) is also shown. The number of selected SM background events and the signal efficiency at this level are presented in Table 3.

The final event selection was done by requiring the gluon to have \(p_{T}>75\) GeV/\(c\) and \(125<m_{\bar{t}}<200\) GeV/\(c^{2}\).

As for the other channels, a probabilistic type of analysis was adopted, using the following variables to built the p.d.f. (_c.f._ Fig. 9):

* the \(qg\) invariant mass,
* the \(b\ell\nu\) invariant mass,
* transverse momentum of the \(b\)-jet (\(p_{Tb}\)),
* transverse momentum of the second non-\(b\) jet (\(p_{Tj}\)) and
* angle between the lepton and the gluon (\(\alpha_{\ell g}\)).

The signal and background discriminant variable distributions are shown in Fig. 10.

#### 3.3.2 "4 jets" sample

For this topology, the preselection was completed by requiring the fourth jet to have \(p_{T}>20\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Only one \(b\)-tagged jet, which had to be among the first

four, was allowed in the event. The gluon jet was assumed to be the non-\(b\) jet with the highest transverse momentum. This distribution is shown in Fig. 11, together with the \(\bar{t}\) mass (\(m_{\bar{t}}\)), reconstructed from the two non-\(b\) jets with the highest transverse momenta. The \(t\) mass is also shown. The number of selected SM background events and the signal efficiency at this level are presented in Table 4.

The final selection was defined by requiring the gluon transverse momentum to be above 100 GeV/\(c\) and the reconstructed \(\bar{t}\) mass above 150 GeV/\(c^{2}\) and below 190 GeV/\(c^{2}\).

After the final selection, the p.d.f. were built based on the following physical distributions (_c.f._ Fig. 12):

* minimum invariant mass of the leading and the second non-\(b\) jets or the leading and the third non-\(b\) jets (\(m_{gj}\)),
* the \(b\ell\nu\) invariant mass,
* transverse momentum of \(qg\),
* transverse momentum of \(b\ell\nu\),
* angle between the lepton and the gluon (\(\alpha_{\ell g}\)),
* angle between the lepton and the \(b\)-jet (\(\alpha_{\ell b}\)) and
* angle between the gluon and the second non-\(b\) jet (\(\alpha_{gq}\)).

The discriminant variable distributions for signal and SM expectation are shown in Fig. 13.

## 4 Results and limits

Expected branching ratios for the FCNC top decays were estimated under two different hypothesis, as explained in the next subsections.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline MC samples & preselection & final selection \\ \hline \hline \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)+jets & 1171.0 & 64.3 \\ \hline \(W\)+jets & 12651.2 & 379.5 \\ \hline \(WW\),\(ZZ\),\(ZW\) & 305.2 & 7.1 \\ \hline single \(t\) & 14263.1 & 453.3 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}_{SM}\) (dileptonic decay) & 8947.8 & 441.5 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}_{SM}\) (semileptonic decay) & 206779.7 & 8668.7 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}_{SM}\) (fully hadronic decay) & 952.4 & 31.9 \\ \hline \hline total SM & 245070.4 & 10046.5 \\ \hline \hline \(\varepsilon_{t}=\varepsilon\times BR_{W\to\ell\nu_{t}}\) (\%) & 1.84 & 0.37 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: The number of selected background events, normalized to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\), and signal efficiencies (convoluted with \(BR_{W\to\ell\nu_{t}}\)) in the \(t\to gu(c)\) channel (4 jets) for the preselection and final selection levels are shown.

### Branching ratio sensitivity (\(5\sigma\) significance discovery hypothesis)

Assuming a signal discovery with a \(5\sigma\) significance, the branching ratio (\(BR\)) sensitivity for each channel studied is estimated by:

\[BR=\frac{5\sqrt{B}}{2\times L\times\sigma(t\bar{t}_{SM})\times\varepsilon_{t} \times\varepsilon_{\ell}}\,, \tag{4}\]

where \(\sigma(t\bar{t}_{SM})=833\) pb [19] is the NLO calculation of the SM cross-section for \(t\bar{t}\) production in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. \(B\) is the total number of selected background events and \(\varepsilon_{\ell}=0.9^{n}\) is the charged leptons identification efficiency (\(n\) is the number of leptons required for each channel). The factor 2 in the denominator takes into account the \(t\) and \(\bar{t}\) contributions to the \(BR\).

In order to compare to previously published results, a cut was applied to the discriminant variables, as given in Table 5. This cut was optimized according to the best \(S/\sqrt{B}\) (\(S\) is the number of selected signal events). The expected branching ratio sensitivities for a \(5\sigma\) discovery are shown in Table 6.

### 95% confidence level limits (absence of signal hypothesis)

In the absence of a FCNC top decay signal, expected limits at 95% confidence level (CL) can be derived using the modified frequentist likelihood method [20]. In this case, the full information of the discriminant variables were used to derive 95% CL upper limits on the number of signal events for each channel. No cuts on the discriminant variables were used. Using the NLO calculation for \(\sigma(t\bar{t}_{SM})\), these limits were then converted into limits on the branching ratio for each of the studied FCNC top decay channels. The expected 95% confidence level limits on the branching ratios are summarized in Table 7.

### Systematic uncertainties and analyses stability

The effect of different systematic sources of uncertainty on the limits evaluation was studied. The following systematic uncertainties were considered:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c||c|c|c|c|} \hline channel & \(t\to Zu(c)\) & \(t\to\gamma u(c)\) & \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{\(t\to gu(c)\)} \\ \hline  & & & (3 jets) & (4 jets) & (combined) \\ \hline \hline \(BR\) (\(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) & \(5.1\times 10^{-4}\) & \(1.2\times 10^{-4}\) & \(4.6\times 10^{-3}\) & \(7.4\times 10^{-3}\) & \(4.6\times 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \(BR\) (\(L=100\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) & \(1.6\times 10^{-4}\) & \(3.8\times 10^{-5}\) & \(1.4\times 10^{-3}\) & \(2.3\times 10^{-3}\) & \(1.4\times 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: The branching ratio sensitivity for each channel in the \(5\sigma\) discovery hypothesis is shown. The results for a luminosity of \(L=10\) and \(100\) fb\({}^{-1}\) are presented.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline channel & \(L_{R}\) cut & \(B\) & \(\varepsilon_{t}\) (\% ) \\ \hline \hline \(t\to Zu(c)\) & \(>5.62\) & 0.50 & 0.07 \\ \hline \(t\to\gamma u(c)\) & \(>3.13\) & 0.16 & 0.11 \\ \hline \(t\to gu(c)\) (3 jets) & \(>1.13\) & 734.1 & 0.20 \\ \hline \(t\to gu(c)\) (4 jets) & \(>-0.38\) & 4033.9 & 0.29 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: The number of selected background events (normalized to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) and signal efficiencies (convoluted with the appropriate branching ratios) for each channel after the specified \(L_{R}\) cut are shown.

* **top mass**: The limits presented in the last subsection were evaluated using background and signal samples generated with \(m_{t}=175\) GeV/\(c^{2}\). The effect of the top mass uncertainty was evaluated using different Monte Carlo samples with \(m_{t}=170\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) and \(m_{t}=180\) GeV/\(c^{2}\). This systematic affects both the event kinematics (and consequently the discriminant variables shape) and the value of the \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section (used in the limits evaluation).
* \(\sigma(t\bar{t})\): The overall theoretical uncertainty on \(\sigma(t\bar{t})\) was estimated to be 12% [21]. This uncertainty was included by varing the \(t\bar{t}_{SM}\) cross-section used both in the \(t\bar{t}_{SM}\) background normalization and in the \(BR\) limits evaluation.
* **PDFs choice**: The CTEQ 5L PDF set was used in the Monte Carlo generation. A different PDF set (CTEQ 4M [15, 16]) was used to estimate the effect of this choice on the event kinematics.
* **b-tag algorithm efficiency**: As mentioned in section 2, the ATLFASTB package was used to parametrize the \(b-tag\) efficiency. The NSET=2 flag (corresponding to a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 60%) was used. In order to study the impact of a different choice, the NSET=1 (corresponding to a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 50%) and NSET=3 (corresponding to a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 70%) options were also used. This source of uncertainty affects the signal efficiency, background estimation and discriminant variable shapes.
* **jet energy calibration**: The impact of the knowledge of the absolute jet energy scale was estimated by recalibrating the reconstructed jet energy. A miscalibration of \(\pm 1\%\) for light jets and \(\pm 3\%\) for \(b\)-jets was used. This uncertainty was found to have a negligible effect on the signal efficiency, background estimation and discriminant variable shapes.
* **analysis stability**: The stability of the sequential analysis was studied by changing the preselection and final selection (typically a \(\pm 10\%\) variation on the cut values was considered).
* **p.d.f. choice**: The discriminant variables were computed using the probability density function sets described in section 3. In order to estimate the effect of a different p.d.f. set, the following changes were studied: 1. \(t\to Zu(c)\) channel: the \(\bar{t}\) reconstruction was done by considering the jet closest to the reconstructed \(Z\) in the invariant mass evaluation. 2. \(t\rightarrow\gamma u(c)\) channel: similarly to the \(t\to Zu(c)\) channel, the \(\bar{t}\) mass reconstruction was done using the jet closest to the leading \(\gamma\). Moreover, the \(t\) mass was included in the p.d.f. set and the multiplicity of jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\) was chosen as p.d.f. (instead of the jet multiplicity).

Table 7: The expected 95% confidence level limits on the FCNC top decays branching ratio in the absence of signal hypothesis are shown. The results for a luminosity of \(L=10\) and \(100\) fb\({}^{-1}\) are presented.

c) \(t\to gu(c)\) channel: in the p.d.f.s definition, \(\Delta R\) was used instead of the angles.

The maximum relative effect on the 95% confidence level expected limits on each considered source of systematic uncertainty (the reference values are those presented in Table 7) is shown in Table 8 (\(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)). Although differences up to 20% were observed (caused by the uncertainty of the top mass), the order of magnitude of the expected limits on the \(BR\) is not affected by any of the systematic uncertainties considered. Moreover, the change on the selection criteria and on the p.d.f. sets do not have a significant impact on the results.

## 5 Conclusions

A new approach was used to study the ATLAS sensitivity to the FCNC \(t\to qX\) (\(X=Z,\gamma,g\)) top decays. Using a probabilistic type of analysis, the expected branching ratio sensitivity was evaluated, being in the range from \(10^{-3}\) to \(10^{-5}\) (for \(L=100\) fb\({}^{-1}\)). These results are compatible with previously published ones [12, 13, 14]. Limits at 95% confidence level are also given in the absence of signal, using the modified frequentist likelihood method [20].
