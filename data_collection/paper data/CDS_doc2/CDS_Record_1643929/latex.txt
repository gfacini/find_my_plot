# **Tagging and suppression of pileup jets**

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The suppression of pileup jets has been a crucial component of many physics analyses using 2012 LHC proton-proton collisions. In ATLAS, tracking information has been used to calculate a variable called the jet-vertex-fraction, which is the fraction of the total momentum of tracks in the jet which is associated to the primary vertex. Imposing a minimum on this variable rejects the majority of pileup jets, but leads to hard-scatter jet efficiencies that depend on the number of reconstructed primary vertices in the event (\(N_{\rm Vtx}\)). In this note, new track-based variables to suppress pileup jets are developed in such a way that the resulting hard-scatter jet efficiency is stable as a function of \(N_{\rm Vtx}\). A multivariate combination of two such variables called the jet-vertex-tagger is constructed. In addition, it is shown that jet-vertex association can be applied to large-\(R\) jets, providing a track-based grooming technique that is as powerful as calorimeter-based trimming but based on complementary tracking information. Finally, the performance of track-based grooming is compared with the recently proposed jet cleansing algorithm.

Introduction

The proton-proton (pp) collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) result not only in hard-scatter (signal) interactions, but also in additional collisions accompanying the signal. Such additional low transverse momentum pp collisions are referred to as _pileup_ interactions. We differentiate between _in-time_ and _out-of-time_ pileup. While in-time pileup arises from additional pp interactions in the current bunch-crossing, out-of-time pileup refers to energy deposits in the ATLAS calorimeter [1] from previous and following bunch crossings relative to the triggered event to which the calorimeter is susceptible. For this note, in-time and out-of-time pileup will be referred to collectively as pileup.

The additional transverse energy flow from pileup interactions is typically subtracted on average from the signal interaction of interest. Local fluctuations in the pileup activity, however, may result in spurious pileup jets. In Ref. [2] it was shown that pileup jets can be effectively removed by a minimal jet-vertex-fraction (JVF) requirement. The JVF variable is defined as the scalar transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) sum of the tracks that are associated to the jet and originate from the hard-scatter vertex divided by the scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) sum of all associated tracks:

\[\mathrm{JVF}=\frac{\sum_{k}p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{trk}_{\mathrm{J}}}(\mathrm{ PV}_{0})}{\sum_{l}p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{trk}_{\mathrm{J}}}(\mathrm{PV}_{0})+ \sum_{n\geq 1}\sum_{l}p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{trk}_{\mathrm{J}}}(\mathrm{ PV}_{n})} \tag{1}\]

Here, \(\mathrm{PV}_{0}\) is the hard-scatter vertex (see section 2.1) and \(\mathrm{PV}_{j}\), \(j\geq 1\) corresponds to primary vertices due to pileup interactions in the same bunch crossing. JVF is bound between 0 and 1, but a value of \(-1\) is assigned to jets with no associated tracks. It follows from its definition that JVF measures the fractional \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) from tracks associated to the hard-scatter vertex. As the denominator of JVF increases with \(N_{\mathrm{Vtx}}\), due to an increase in the number of pileup tracks associated to the jet, the mean JVF for signal jets is shifted to smaller values. The explicit pileup dependence of JVF results in a \(N_{\mathrm{Vtx}}\) dependent signal jet efficiency when a minimal JVF criterion is imposed to reject pileup jets. This effect is illustrated in Figure 1 for a JVF \(>0.5\) requirement.

## 2 Object definition and event selection

### Object reconstruction

The reconstruction and definition of physics objects used in this analysis is based on Ref. [2], where more details can be found.

The event hard-scatter primary vertex is defined as the one reconstructed vertex with the largest \(\sum p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}\) of constituent tracks. Tracks are selected with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.5\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and are further required to pass quality criteria designed to reject poorly measured and fake tracks. Tracks originating from the hard-scatter primary vertex and from pileup vertices are then associated to jets using a technique known as ghost association [3] which is described in Ref. [2].

Calorimeter jets are reconstructed from topological clusters [4] using the local cluster weighting (LCW) algorithm [5]. Fastjet 2.4.3 is used to reconstruct anti-\(k_{t}\)[6] jets with a distance parameter \(R=0.4\). Similarly, truth jets are reconstructed as anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=0.4\) jets from stable truth particles in the final state of the simulated hard-scatter interaction. Calorimeter jets are calibrated using pileup subtraction followed by a jet-energy-scale (JES) response correction, as described in detail in Refs. [7, 2]. Jets are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\,\mathrm{GeV}\) and to be within \(|\eta|<2.4\) so that their charged particles are within the coverage of the inner tracking detector. Large-\(R\) jets are reconstructed from LCW topological clusters using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with \(R=1.0\).

Similarly to Ref. [2], pileup and hard-scatter jets are defined based on truth information. Signal jets are matched within \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}<0.3\) to a truth jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\,\mathrm{GeV}\)1, whereas pileup jets are required to have a minimal \(\Delta R>0.6\) from any truth jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>4\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

Footnote 1: The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>10\,\mathrm{GeV}\) threshold is used to avoid accidental matches of reconstructed jets with soft activity from the truth hard-scatter.

### Samples and event selection

For this study, QCD dijet events are produced with the Pythia8[8] generator (version 8.160) using the CT10 PDF set [9] and the AU2 CT10 underlying-event tune [10]. A sample of \(\mathrm{W}^{\prime}\to\mathrm{WZ}\to\mathrm{qqqq}\) events with a \(\mathrm{W}^{\prime}\) mass of 1 TeV is generated using Pythia8 and the MSTW 2008 PDF set [11]. The effect of in-time as well as out-of-time pileup is simulated using minimum-bias events generated with Pythia8 to reflect the pileup conditions during the 2012 data-taking period. All generated events were processed with a detailed simulation of the ATLAS detector response [12] based on geant4[13] and subsequently reconstructed and analyzed in the same way as the data.

## 3 New variables

Two new variables to separate hard-scatter from pileup jets are introduced: corrJVF, which is a pileup-corrected JVF variable, and \(R_{\mathrm{pT}}\), which combines both calorimeter and tracking information.

The quantity corrJVF is a variable similar to JVF, but corrected for the \(N_{\mathrm{Vtx}}\) dependent average scalar sum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) from pileup tracks associated to a jet (\(\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{PU}}\rangle\)). It is defined as

\[\mathrm{corrJVF}=\frac{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{HS}}}{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ HS}}+p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{PU,corr}}} \tag{2}\]

where \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{HS}}\) is the scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) sum of the tracks that are associated to the jet and originate from the hard-scatter vertex and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{PU,corr}}\) is a measure of the pileup \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of a jet relative to the average pileup activity in the event. Since \(\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{PU}}\rangle\) increases linearly with the total number of pileup tracks per event (\(n_{\mathrm{t}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{PU}}\)), we define \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{PU,corr}}=p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{PU}}/(k\cdot n_{ \mathrm{t}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{k}}^{\mathrm{PU}})\) with \(k=0.01\). The number of pileup tracks per event is computed fromall tracks associated to vertices other than the hard-scatter vertex. The scaling factor \(k\) is roughly taken as the slope of \(\langle p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{PU}}\rangle\) with \(n_{\mathrm{rk}}^{\mathrm{PU}}\), but the resulting discrimination between HS and PU jets is insensitive to the choice of \(k\). The full definition of corrJVF is

\[\mathrm{corrJVF}=\frac{\sum_{k}p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{trk}_{k}}(\mathrm{PV} _{0})}{\sum_{l}p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{trk}_{k}}(\mathrm{PV}_{0})+\frac{\sum_{ k=1}\sum_{l}p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{trk}_{l}}(\mathrm{PV}_{n})}{(k\cdot n_{ \mathrm{rk}}^{\mathrm{PU}})}}. \tag{3}\]

Figure 2(a) shows the corrJVF distribution for pileup (PU) and hard-scatter (HS) jets. A value corrJVF \(=-1\) is assigned to jets with no associated tracks.

Figure 2(b) shows the hard-scatter jet efficiency as a function of the number of reconstructed primary vertices in the event when imposing a minimal corrJVF or JVF requirement such that the \(N_{\mathrm{Vtx}}\) inclusive efficiency is 90%. For the full range of \(N_{\mathrm{Vtx}}\) considered, the hard-scatter jet efficiency after a selection based on corrJVF is stable at 90% \(\pm\) 1%, whereas for JVF the efficiency degrades by about 20%, from 97% to 75%. The scaling factor (\(k\)) in the corrJVF distribution does not affect the stability of the HS jet efficiency with \(N_{\mathrm{Vtx}}\).

The variable \(R_{\mathrm{PT}}\) is defined as the scalar \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) sum of the tracks that are associated to the jet and originate from the hard-scatter vertex divided by the fully calibrated jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), which includes pileup subtraction:

\[R_{\mathrm{PT}}=\frac{\sum_{k}p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{trk}_{k}}(\mathrm{PV}_{ 0})}{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{jet}}. \tag{4}\]

\(R_{\mathrm{PT}}\) is peaked at 0 and steeply falling for pileup jets, where no or only little \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) from tracks from the hard-scatter vertex is expected. For hard-scatter jets, however, \(R_{\mathrm{PT}}\) has the meaning of a charged \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction and its mean value and spread is larger than for pileup jets. \(R_{\mathrm{PT}}\) is also called fragmentation function. Since \(R_{\mathrm{PT}}\) involves only tracks that are associated to the hard-scatter vertex, its definition is at first order independent of \(N_{\mathrm{Vtx}}\). The \(R_{\mathrm{PT}}\) distributions for pileup (PU) and hard-scatter (HS) jets are shown in Figure 3(a).

Figure 3(b) shows the hard-scatter jet efficiency as a function of \(N_{\mathrm{Vtx}}\) when imposing a minimal \(R_{\mathrm{PT}}\) and JVF requirement such that the \(N_{\mathrm{Vtx}}\) inclusive efficiency is 90%. For the

full range of \(N_{\rm Vtx}\) considered, the hard-scatter jet efficiency after a selection based on \(R_{\rm PT}\) is stable at \(90\%\pm 1\%\).

Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the 2-dimensional correlation of \(R_{\rm pT}\) and corrJVF for hard-scatter and pileup jets, respectively. Hard-scatter jets are characterized by large corrJVF and large \(R_{\rm pT}\), whereas pileup jets are concentrated at low \(R_{\rm pT}\) and low corrJVF values. The correlation between these two variables holds valuable information that can be exploited when discriminating hard-scatter from pileup jets. Jets with corrJVF \(=-1\) (i.e. no associated tracks) or \(R_{\rm pT}>1.5\) are omitted in these plots. Most

pileup jets (and about 1% of hard-scatter jets) have no tracks that originate from the hard-scatter vertex and thus corrJVF \(=R_{\rm pT}=0\).

## 4 The jet-vertex tagger

A new discriminant called the jet-vertex-tagger (JVT) is constructed using \(R_{\rm pT}\) and corrJVF as a 2-dimensional likelihood, based on a k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm [14]. For each point in the two-dimensional \(R_{\rm pT}-\rm corrJVF\) plane, the relative probability for a jet in that point to be of signal type is computed as the ratio of the number of hard-scatter jets divided by the number of hard-scatter plus pileup jets found in a local neighborhood around the point using a training sample of signal and pileup jets with \(20<p_{\rm T}<50\,\)GeV and \(|\eta|<2.4\). The local neighborhood is defined dynamically as the 100 nearest neighbors around the test point using a Euclidean metric in the \(R_{\rm pT}-\rm corrJVF\) space. Since it is only based on two variables, the kNN algorithm allows for a local and straightforward calculation of the relative signal probability, while largely avoiding statistical fluctuations in sparsely populated regions.

The JVT distribution for hard-scatter and pileup jets with \(20<p_{\rm T}<30\,\)GeV is shown in Figure 5(a). A value of JVT=-0.1 is assigned to jets with no associated tracks. Figure 5(b) shows the hard-scatter jet efficiency as a function of the number of reconstructed primary vertices in the event when imposing a minimal JVT and JVF requirement such that the \(N_{\rm Vtx}\) inclusive efficiency is 90%. For the full range of \(N_{\rm Vtx}\) considered, the hard-scatter jet efficiency after a selection based on JVT is stable at \(90\%\pm 1\%\).

Figure 6 shows the fake rate versus efficiency curves comparing the performance of the three variables corrJVF, \(R_{\rm pT}\), and JVT when selecting a sample of jets with \(20<p_{\rm T}<50\,\)GeV in simulated dijet events. It shows the fraction of pileup jets passing a minimal corrJVF, \(R_{\rm pT}\) and JVT requirement as a function of the signal jet efficiency resulting from the same requirement. The JVT performance is driven by the corrJVF (\(R_{\rm pT}\)) curve in the region of high signal jet efficiency (high pileup rejection). Using JVT, signal efficiencies of 80%, 90% and 95% are achieved for pileup fake rates of respectively 0.4%, 1% and 4%.

## 5 Track-based Trimming of Large-\(R\) jets

At the LHC, many interesting signatures of both Standard Model and new physics processes contain boosted heavy particles, such as W, Z, and H bosons, or top quarks. The successful identification of such topologies requires the use of large-\(R\) jets and jet substructure techniques. One of the key ingredients of jet substructure studies is the use of _grooming_ techniques (_filtering_[15], _pruning_[16, 17], and _trimming_[18]) that mitigate the effect of pileup on large-\(R\) jets. Since pileup effects on the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are proportional to the area of jets, grooming becomes essential in the case of large-\(R\) (\(R>0.6\)) jets.

Jet grooming techniques attempt to identify and reject components of large-\(R\) jets that are consistent with pileup depositions, effectively reducing the jet area and the sensitivity to pileup. In the case of trimming, for example, \(R=0.3\)\(k_{t}\) subjets with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) fraction relative to the parent (ungroomed) jet smaller than \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}=p_{T}^{subjet}/p_{T}^{jet}=0.05\) are removed.

Building upon the success of calorimeter-based grooming methods and track-based pileup suppression of small-R jets, a new, track-based, grooming technique can be designed by applying corrJVF to the individual subjets of large-\(R\) jets. In particular, track-based trimming can be implemented by replacing the \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}\) criterion with a requirement on the corrJVF of subjets. Other variables, such as JVT or \(R_{\mathrm{pT}}\) can also be considered, but this note focuses on the use of corrJVF as an example of a purely track-based grooming procedure.

In order to illustrate the concept of track-based grooming, it is useful to consider an event display. Figure 7 shows the rapidity (\(y\)) vs. azimuthal angle \(\varphi\) view of a simulated event where a \(W^{\prime}\) boson with a mass of 1 TeV decays to a \(W\) and a \(Z\) boson, which in turn decay fully hadronically. The orange star and blue triangle indicate the \(y\) - \(\varphi\) positions of the generated \(Z\) and \(W\) bosons respectively. The large circles represent the active area boundaries of the anti-\(k_{t}\)\(R=1.0\) jets, built from topological calorimeter clusters [4]. In the following, these jets are referred to as ungroomed jets. The clusters are represented by small solid squares with colors ranging from blue to red encoding low to high transverse energies respectively. The gray regions indicate the active areas of the \(k_{t}\)\(R=0.3\) subjets reconstructed from the constituents of the ungroomed jets. Only subjets with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of at least 5% of the ungroomed jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) are shown. Tracks associated to the jet and originating from the hard-scatter vertex (black open circles) or from pileup vertices (black crosses) are also indicated. The violet ungroomed jet (with \(\varphi\approx 4.1\) and \(y\approx-0.2\)) has a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 446 GeV and is matched in \(\Delta R\) to the truth \(Z\) boson. While all three subjets have

Figure 6: Fake rate versus efficiency curves for corrJVF, \(R_{\mathrm{pT}}\), and JVT.

active areas overlapping with the \(y-\varphi\) positions of pileup tracks, only two subjets have associated hard-scatter tracks. The invariant mass reconstructed from the two subjets with hard-scatter tracks is 88.7 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and the one from all three subjets is 119.2 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). This event display shows that tracking information can provide complementary information to calorimeter-based trimming. Track-assisted trimming would allow to reject the third subjet, which is likely to originate from pileup, while keeping the two subjets from the \(Z\) boson.

Figure 8 shows the ratio of the subjet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and the ungroomed jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (\(f_{\mathrm{cut}}\) value) on a log-scale as a function of the subjet corrJVF in simulated \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\to\mathrm{qqqq}\) events. The 2-dimensional distribution is normalized to unit area. A small fraction of subjets with no associated tracks (corrJVF = \(-1\)) are omitted. Ungroomed jets are selected that have a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of at least 300 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), \(|\eta|<1.5\), and are matched in \(\Delta R\) to the truth \(Z\). The corrJVF of the subjets is calculated from the associated hard-scatter and pileup tracks. Most subjets with significant \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ratio also have large corrJVF, indicating that most of their charged \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) comes from the hard-scatter vertex. A large fraction of subjets with a low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ratio \(<5\%\) (\(\log_{10}[p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{sub}}/p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ ungroomed}}]<-1.3\)) and a few subjets with a significant \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ratio, however, have small corrJVF values. Most such subjets are consistent with pileup and should be excluded in a track-based jet grooming procedure. Similarly, subjets with small \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ratio and large corrJVF that would be removed by calorimeter-based trimming, should be kept by the track-based trimming algorithm.

In Figure 9(a), the performance of track-based grooming is evaluated by comparing the distribution of jet mass using different cuts of subjet corrJVF and combinations of corrJVF and \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}\). The same selection criteria as in Figure 8 are used. In this procedure, and for the 2012 pileup conditions with an average of about 21 pp interactions per bunch crossing, a \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}\) of 4% in addition to the requirement of corrJVF \(>0.6\) is found to optimize the mass resolution of the groomed jet.

Figure 9(b) compares the performance of the track-assisted grooming procedure with a recently proposed jet grooming technique called "jet cleansing" [19]. Standard calorimeter-based trimming with \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}=0.05\) is also shown for reference. In JVF cleansing, the 4-momentum of each subjet is scaled by the subjet JVF, aiming to approximate the momentum of the subjet arising from neutral and charged particles from the hard-scatter vertex only. In linear cleansing, the subjet 4-momentum from the hard-scatter vertex is approximated by scaling the reconstructed 4-momentum based on the assumption that

Figure 7: (a) Rapidity - phi view of a simulated event of a \(W^{\prime}\) boson with a mass of 1 \(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) decaying to a \(W\) and a \(Z\). (b) Zoom-in version of (a).

the ratio of charged to charged plus neutral pileup \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) contributing to a subjet is 0.55. Each \(f_{\mathrm{cut}}\) used in these procedures is chosen to optimize the mass resolution. For 2012 pileup conditions, the application of track-assisted grooming achieves a similar mass resolution to that of calorimeter-based trimming. No significance difference between corrJVF and linear jet cleansing is observed. However, for higher luminosity conditions, as expected for the HL-LHC, track-based grooming provides an alternative to calorimeter-only approaches.

## 6 Conclusions

A new jet-vertex tagging technique, JVT, has been developed for the suppression of pileup jets. The JVT algorithm outperforms the previous JVF algorithm used in ATLAS and solves a fundamental feature of JVF, which is a pileup-dependent jet selection efficiency. The JVT algorithm combines two new pileup-insensitive variables: corrJVF and \(R_{\mathrm{PT}}\) into a 2-dimensional likelihood. Jet selections based on JVT result in hard-scatter jet efficiencies that are stable within 1%. This pileup stability also implies that there is no need to re-optimize JVT cut values as pileup conditions change, reducing the dependence on jet reconstruction and the selection of \(b\)-tagging and other jet-by-jet tagging techniques.

Track-based pileup jet suppression has also been extended to the case of large-\(R\) jets by introducing a track-based trimming algorithm that applies a corrJVF selection at the subjet level. The new track-based grooming achieves the same performance as that of calorimeter-based trimming, while using complementary tracking information. The recently proposed jet cleansing grooming technique has also been studied, and results in similar performance to that of all other methods considered.

The techniques developed in this analysis can, in principle, be extended to work in the forward region

The dotted line indicates the standard calorimeter-based trimming \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ratio cut of 5%. Calorimeter-based trimming would remove all subjets that are below the dotted line, including those with large corrJVF values.

The blue shaded histogram shows the ungroomed jet mass. In the histograms with magenta, blue and green markers, the groomed jet mass is computed from subjets that satisfy a corrJVF \(>0.6\) requirement, i.e. excluding subjets from pileup interactions. In the blue and green histograms, the subjets are further required to have \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{subj}}/p_{\text{T}}^{\text{ ungroomed}}\) (\(f_{\text{cut}}\)) of at least 4% and 10% respectively.

The histogram represented by magenta bullets shows the trimmed jet mass, where the mass is computed from the subjets that have a \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{subj}}/p_{\text{T}}^{\text{ ungroomed}}\) of at least 5% (\(f_{\text{cut}}=0.05\)). For the green and black histograms, jet cleansing is used.

through the use of jet substructure variables measured with calorimeter-only observables. In the context of large-\(R\) jets, track-based grooming techniques which do not rely on 1-to-1 particle-cluster matching can provide a promising alternative to more sophisticated particle flow methods.
