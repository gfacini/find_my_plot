**Abstract**

Liquid scintillator prototype modules for the forward calorimetry al LHC have been constructed and tested in the CERN PS beam. The modules consist of a sealed \(50\times 6\times 6\)\(cm^{3}\) absorber matrix instrumented with thin hollow light guides. The response and resolution at small angles in the energy range \(1\div 5\) GeV were measured and found to be in a reasonable agreement with MC calculations performed with GEANT 3.15.

Design concept and motivation

The forward calorimeter is an essential component of a collider experiment at LHC. Its main purpose is to extend the "calorimetrized" pseudorapidity coverage of the detector to make possible the measurement of missing \(E_{T}\) and, thereby, the detection of heavy Higgs boson (with \(m_{H}\) > 0.5 TeV) and supersymmetric particles by their decay modes with missing energy. Another purpose is the jet tagging to identify WW/ZZ fusion processes.

The main challenge to a forward calorimeter design is a very high radiation dose it must withstand (up to 100 _Mradyear_ at \(\eta\)=5, for a luminosity of \(2\cdot 10^{4}\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}\)). This implies the use of _radiation hard materials_ and an appropriate protection of read-out electronics, as well as a protection (or replaceability) of other parts that cannot be made radiation hard otherwise. The forward calorimeter must cover a pseudorapidity interval 3 > \(\eta\)! > 5.1 Estimates show that a hadronic energy resolution of \(\Delta E_{b}/E\!\leq 100\%/\sqrt{E}+5\%\) and a lateral granularity comparable with the typical high energy hadronic shower width is sufficient to match the physics requirements. Finally, the forward calorimeter must be fast enough to minimize pile-up effects.

Footnote 1: Where \(\eta\)! > 4 is needed mainly to ensure a better shower containment for lower \(\eta\) hadrons. At higher \(\eta\), \(E_{T}\) associated with jets is on average less than \(E_{T}\) of neutrinos from heavy flavour decays in background processes, like Z+jet(s) production.

All these constraints restrict the choice of suitable calorimeter techniques. In the framework of the ATLAS Collaboration for LHC, we concentrated on the study of a quasi-projective liquid scintillator calorimeter[1], which combines known advantages of the SPACAL type calorimeter with the possibility to replace the active medium as it deteriorates due to the radiation damage.

## 2 Prototype module design and construction

At the first stage of the work we aimed at designing and constructing a "proof of principle" prototype module. We started with a choice of materials for the basic components of a calorimeter: an absorber, a scintillating liquid and light-guides.

To decide on the calorimeter structure, several requirements should be taken into account:

* liquid light guides should be thick enough to ensure easy liquid filling and flow (outer diameter >3\(mm\));
* to achieve \(e/\pi\) ratio close to unity, the sampling fraction should be small (about 2.3% in case of lead absorber and organic scintillator)[2];
* the distance between holes should be shorter than the Moliere radius \(R_{M}\) (about 2 cm in our case), to preserve a reasonable energy resolution for electromagnetic showers; the hadronic energy resolution is by far less critical to that parameter.

In practice, the optimum is reached with the tubes having the outer diameter 3.5+4.0 mm, depending on the choice of materials.

We ended up with the design shown in Fig. 1 and constructed 50 cm long prototype modules with a lead (Fig. 2) and an iron absorbers. The only difference between the modules is the hole cross-section - round, 3.8 mm in diameter for the lead case and square, of 3.8-3.8 \(mm^{2}\), for the iron case. The sheets of absorber are loaded into a square aluminum profile which serves also as the base of the leak proof cover. From both sides the profile is hermetically closed by transparent glass windows. The plastic light guide/mixer of 15 cm length is attached to one of the windows followed by EMI 9839A PM tube. The light guide also translates a square image of the module into a round one and demagnities it to match the two-inch photocathode of PM tube. On the second (forward) window the LED used for the module calibration is fixed. The whole assembly is placed in the light tight cover.

_Light-guides and the liquid._ Two options are presently available from industry:

* plastic tubes, flexible, having very low index of refraction (down to 1.35), compatible with a wide spectrum of relatively cheap and chemically mild organic liquid scintillators. Main short-coming of this option is relatively low radiation hardness. Radiation tests of specimens of high quality plastic tubes from an industrial firm producing light guides[3]. showed that they cannot stand doses exceeding 20 Mrad.
* glass or quartz capillaries, providing excellent optical quality cladding (hence, small reflection losses). The main problem is the high refractive index of glass (\(n_{s}\) = 1.47/1.50) which implies the use of a scintillating liquid with even higher index. All such liquids (like methylnaphtalene, \(n_{s}\) = 1.58) are notably less transparent than regular liquid scintillators. On the other hand, there are indications that methylnaphtalene based liquid scintillators can stand relatively high doses (up to 60 Mrad)[4].

We performed a series of light-transmission and light-output measurements with single tubes and capillaries, filled with different liquids. \(Ru^{100}\) was used as a particle source. The following combinations were found to be suitable for the module construction:

* BICRON B liquid[5] in glass capillary[6] (2.5 mm inner diameter, 3.6 mm outer diameter). It exhibits the attenuation length of about 90 cm and the light output resulting in about 10 photo-electrons (23% photocathode quantum efficiency).
* BICRON BC 517P[7] liquid in LUMATEC plastic light guide (3.2 mm inner diameter, 3.6 mm outer diameter) It has the attenuation length of about 200 cm and the light output resulting also in about 10 photoelectrons (23 % QE).

The decay time for both liquids was measured and turned out to be similar - about 8+9 ns.

At present, we constructed three versions of the prototype module:

* lead and iron modules with LUMATEC plastic light guides filled with BC 517P liquid scintillator,lead module with glass capillaries filled with a BICRON B liquid.

## 3 Measurements

In all measurements the signal from PM was digitized after amplification by the charge sensitive ADC LeCroy 2249W with the 300 ns integration time (if otherwise is not stated explicitely). For cosmic tests the high voltage on the PM was chosen high enough to distinguish a single photoelectron peak,which allowed us to convert the charge measured by ADC into the number of photoelectrons detected. For beam tests with a light output of one or two orders of magnitude higher we decreased the H.V. to keep the PM response of linear. The corresponding amplification decrease was measured by means of a signal from the LED fixed at the forward glass window of the module. This allowed us to directly compare the results expressed in the number of photoelectrons (including the results of single capillary or tube measurements).

### Cosmic tests

For every module the response to the minimum ionising particles (MIP) was measured. For this purpose a simple cosmic trigger based on the coincidence of two counters (6 x 5 \(cm^{2}\) each) placed above and under the module was provided. The bottom counter was shielded from above by 5 cm of lead. The measurements were made at different points along the module to study the overall light attenuation in module. A reasonable agreement with the single capillary(tube) measurements was found.

The results of cosmic measurements at about 10 cm distance from the beginning of the module (where the main part of electromagnetic shower is absorbed) were used later to express the energy (light) deposition in beam tests in equivalent MIPs.

Fig. 3 shows typical response of one of the modules to cosmic muons. The shape is well described by GEANT Monte-Carlo. The clearly visible peak proves that cosmic muons can be used for monitoring purposes.

### Beam tests

The measurements were carried out in the T10 test beam at CERN PS. The beam energy range is from 1 to 5 GeV. Electrons and pions were separated by means of gas Cherenkov counter. The trigger was based on the coincidence of the three scintillating counters in front of the module with an overlap area of about 0.9 x 2.4 \(cm^{2}\).

Unfortunately, there were other detectors in the beam a few meters upstream the module. The estimated total amount of material in the beam is about 20% of radiation length. That spoiled the module response for electrons resulting in an excess of events with lower energy deposition. To check this assumption we increased the amount of material in the beam and found the corresponding increase of low amplitude events rate.

#### 3.2.1 Electrons

The modules were exposed to the beam particles at different angles. In all the measurements the position of the center of the module front face was kept unchanged with respect to the beam spot.

The response of the lead module with glass capillaries to 5 GeV electrons at the incidence angle of \(0^{0}\) and \(5^{0}\) is given in Fig.4. The corresponding Monte-Carlo (GEANT) results are also shown for comparison. The MC predicted deposited energy to ADC channel conversion factor was adjusted so as to match MC and the measured peak values together. Apart from the excess of events with small energy deposition due to the beam imperfections (see 3.2), the MC results reasonably agree with the experimental data. Somewhat longer tails predicted by MC can be attributed to the simplified model used to describe the module in this version of the program. The origin of the nongaussian tail towards large amplitudes at small angles is clear. It is due to a higher response to electromagnetic showers having the impact point in the vicinity of a capillary. This effect was previously observed by SPACAL collaboration[8]. The energy resolution for the electrons was found to degrade rapidly with the incidence angle approaching \(0^{0}\).

The resolution as a function of the incidence angle for the lead modules is shown in Fig.5. The comparison of the iron and lead modules is given in Fig.6. For every measurement the two values are presented: r.m.s./E\(>\) and the fitted value \(\sigma_{\mu}/E_{R^{\prime}}\). A gaussian fit was applied to the central part of the distributions around the peak. The systematic uncertainties estimated to be as large as \(\pm 15\%\) are not shown. At least two sources of errors should be mentioned. The angular position of the modules was measured with the \(\pm 0.5^{0}\) precision. Because of non-gaussian shape of the response function the fit is very sensitive to the choice of the fitted range. As one can see from the figures, \(\sigma_{\mu}\) varies slowly with the angle, while R.M.S. dominated by the tails increases very rapidly below \(3^{0}\). The lead modules with capillaries and those with plastic tubes show a similar resolution. The iron module has a better resolution than the lead one as could be expected because of the larger Moliere radius for iron.

We studied the linearity of the response in the energy range 1 - 5 GeV. It turned out to be linear for all the three modules with the offset compatible with zero within the experimental uncertainties (Fig.7). The resolution as a function of \(1/\sqrt{E}\) for one of the modules (similar results were obtained for the others) is shown in Fig. 8 together with the GEANT MC prediction for 5 GeV.

#### 3.2.2 Pions

Obviously the prototype modules are too short (2.3 \(\lambda\)) and narrow to contain hadronic showers. The overall leakage of about 55% is expected from MC simulations performed with GHEISHA and FLUKA. Nevertheless, pion beam tests provide valuable information for designing a full scale prototype.

We exposed the modules to 5 GeV pions at the incidence angle of \(1^{0}\). The angle is not of great importance in the case of pions as the hadron showers have a larger lateral size as compared with the electromagnetic ones. As it was shown in[9], there is no degradation in the energy resolution at small angles.

The response of the lead module with glass capillaries is given in Fig.9. It is seen that the shape is satisfactorily reproduced by MC. The excess of events near zero could be explained by a simplified description of the module in the MC. In particular, the MC does not include the additional amplification effects for particles leaking out at the rear end of the module where there is a 8 mm compartment needed to fill the capillaries with liquid. Light produced by the particles traversing this compartment is collected with much higher efficiency than the light trapped in a capillaries. If introduced, such a correction would shift events contained in the first bin (which are mainly punch-through pions) towards higher amplitudes. We fitted the distribution over the range of about 3 \(\sigma\) around the peak. The resolution thus obtained, /<E>=51%, is in good agreement with MC predictions (60% from GHEISHA, 51% from FLUKA). For the calorimeter in which hadronic showers will be fully contained both MC programs predict the resolution of about 25%.
