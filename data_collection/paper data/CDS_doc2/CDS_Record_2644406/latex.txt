The primary goal of the heavy ion program at ATLAS is to study the properties of the deconfined, strongly interacting matter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP). QCD jets are one of the primary tools used to study this matter. Jet properties are observed to be modified in Pb+Pb collisions compared to \(pp\) collisions and the modifications are sensitive to the interactions between the QGP and the jet. Jet measurements in heavy ion collisions at ATLAS aim to provide information about the nature of these interactions. This note describes expected ATLAS measurements of jet modification in heavy-ion collisions in the upcoming LHC Runs 3 and 4. In particular, projections are made for inclusive jet yield measurements, jet fragmentation function measurements, and photon-tagged jet measurements.

## 1 Introduction

The primary goal of the heavy ion program at the LHC is to study the properties of deconfined strongly-interacting matter, often referred to as a quark-gluon plasma (QGP), created in ultra-relativistic nuclear collisions. Jets are among the most powerful probes of this matter because they are sensitive to the short distance interactions between hard scattered-partons and the constituents of the QGP [1].

Results from jet measurements in Pb+Pb collisions at the LHC have shown that the transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) balance of back-to-back produced jets and photon-jet pairs is modified [2; 3]. The number of measured jets is reduced by approximately a factor of two as compared to the jet yields measured in \(pp\) collisions scaled by the geometric nuclear overlap [4; 5]. Furthermore, the fragmentation of both inclusive jets and jets opposite a photon [6] are modified relative to \(pp\) collisions.

Current measurements are based on 0.49 nb\({}^{-1}\)of Pb+Pb collisions and 25 pb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions collected in 2015. Jets are rarely produced and additional luminosity is needed to extend the kinematic range and improve the precision of the measurements. In this note, the expected performance for some jet related observables in the LHC Run 3 and 4 are presented. The assumed luminosity for Runs 3 and 4 is 10 nb\({}^{-1}\), approximately a factor of 20 more than is available in current measurements. The projections presented here represent a selected list of measurements of interest using the Run 3 and 4 data. The selected suite of measurements shows clear examples of physics that could only be addressable with substantially increased luminosity.

## 2 ATLAS Detector

The ATLAS detector is described in detail in [7]. Significant upgrades to the ATLAS detector are expected to be installed for Run 4, in particular the Inner Tracker (ITk) [8]. The performance of the ITk in Pb+Pb collisions is discussed in [9]. In this note the projections using the ITk are not discussed.

## 3 Projections

The projections presented in this note account only for statistical uncertainties. For systematic uncertainties, some improvement is expected for the Run 3 and 4 data based on advancement in the measurement technique and improved understanding of the detector. These are discussed in section 4, however, at present, it is not possible to make a quantitative projection taking into account these expectations.

### Inclusive Jet Measurements

The quantification of the amount of energy lost by the parton shower due to interactions with the deconfined QCD medium can be provided in terms of the nuclear modification factor defined as:

\[R_{\rm AA}=\frac{\frac{1}{N_{\rm{ev}}^{\rm tot}}\frac{\mathrm{d}^{2}N_{\rm{jet}} }{\mathrm{d}p_{\rm T}\mathrm{d}y}\Bigg{|}_{\rm{cent}}}{T_{\rm AA}\frac{\mathrm{d }^{2}\sigma_{\rm{jet}}}{\mathrm{d}p_{\rm T}\mathrm{d}y}\Bigg{|}_{pp}}\,, \tag{1}\]

where \(N_{\rm{jet}}\) and \(\sigma_{\rm{jet}}\) are the jet yield in Pb+Pb collisions and the jet cross section in \(pp\) collisions, respectively, both measured as a function of transverse momentum, \(p_{\rm T}\), and rapidity, \(y\). \(N_{\rm{ev}}^{\rm tot}\) and \(T_{\rm AA}\) are the total number of Pb+Pb collisions within a chosen centrality interval and the nuclear thickness function, respectively. Measurement of the jet \(R_{\rm AA}\) is a baseline measurement for comparisons with theoretical predictions of jet quenching. A value of \(R_{\rm AA}\approx 0.5-0.6\) in central Pb+Pb collisions was reported in measurements at \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.76\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}=5.02\) TeV [4; 10; 11]. This implies a suppression of jet yields by roughly a factor of two in central collisions to the expectation from scaled \(pp\) collisions at the same center-of-mass energy. Two intriguing features were revealed by these studies: \(R_{\rm AA}\) increases only very slowly with increasing jet \(p_{\rm T}\) and seems to saturate at the value of 0.6 in the region of \(p_{\rm T}\) between 400 GeV and 1 TeV; \(R_{\rm AA}\) exhibits no dependence on the rapidity of the jet (except for the most forward region where the \(R_{\rm AA}\) shows signs of decreasing with rapidity). Both of these features seem counter-intuitive since one would expect that jet quenching effects should play smaller role at high \(p_{\rm T}\) compared to low \(p_{\rm T}\) and since there is _a priori_ no reason to expect rapidity independence given the differences in the spectral shape and differences in the flavor composition of jets at different rapidities. Providing a precise quantification of the \(R_{\rm AA}\) at a TeV scale, along with detailing the evolution of \(R_{\rm AA}\) with rapidity, are two primary goals for LHC Runs 3 and 4.

The data points from the measured jet \(R_{\rm AA}\) at 5.02 TeV [11] with smoothed statistical variations are plotted in Figure 1 together with statistical uncertainties projected for 10 nb\({}^{-1}\). The left panel of Figure 1 shows the estimated gain in the statistical precision for jet \(R_{\rm AA}\) measured in the rapidity interval of \(|y|<2.1\) reaching a factor of approximately 5. The estimate was also made using two different scenarios for the total integrated luminosity of \(pp\) data, 600 pb\({}^{-1}\)and 1.2 fb\({}^{-1}\). A negligible difference in the statistical precision was found between those two scenarios which demonstrates no need for \(pp\) integrated luminosity beyond 600 pb\({}^{-1}\). Expected precision on the \(R_{\rm AA}\) measurement is compared with several recent model predictions: Linear Boltzmann Transport model (LBT) [12], three calculations using the Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) [13; 14; 15; 16], and Effective Quenching model (EQ) [17]. The phenomenological effective quenching model [17] includes energy loss effects through downward shifts in the jet \(p_{\rm T}\) spectrum that depends on the flavor of the parton that initiating a jet. The figure demonstrates that the higher precision data will provide means to constrain or falsify theoretical model predictions. The right panel of Figure 1 shows the estimated gain in the statistical precision in the forward rapidity region. The statistical precision should be sufficient to quantitatively assess the rapidity dependence of the \(R_{\rm AA}\). Both of these predictions indicate that Runs 3 and 4 should bring a definitive understanding of the intriguing features of jet \(R_{\rm AA}\) as seen in the current data.

### Fragmentation Function Measurements

In order to further explore the jet energy loss mechanism, the internal structure of jets is measured in heavy-ion collisions and the results are compared to similar measurements in \(pp\) collisions. The measurement of the jet structure in the sample of inclusive jets provides higher precision and the ability to perform the measurement more differentially compared to the photon-tagged studies, which suffer from a limited statistical precision. The jet internal structure can be characterized by the charged-particle longitudinal fragmentation functions, where charged particles are associated with jets, and the longitudinal momentum fraction relative to the jet momentum is evaluated as:

\[z\equiv p_{\mathrm{T}}\cos\Delta R\;/\;p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}. \tag{2}\]

The fragmentation function is then defined as:

\[D(z)\equiv\frac{1}{N_{\mathrm{jet}}}\frac{\mathrm{d}n_{\mathrm{ch}}}{\mathrm{ d}z}, \tag{3}\]

where \(N_{\mathrm{jet}}\) is the number of jets and \(n_{\mathrm{ch}}\) is the number of charged particles associated with jets via an angular matching \(\Delta R<0.4\), where \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) with \(\Delta\eta\) and \(\Delta\phi\) defined as the distances between the jet axis and the charged-particle direction in pseudorapidity and azimuth, respectively.

Charged-particle longitudinal fragmentation functions were observed to be modified in Pb+Pb collisions compared to the \(pp\) reference both at 2.76 TeV [18; 19; 20] and 5.02 TeV [21]. The magnitude of the modification is quantified by the ratios of the fragmentation functions in the two colliding systems:

\[R_{D(z)}\equiv\frac{D(z)_{\mathrm{PbPb}}}{D(z)_{pp}}. \tag{4}\]

Measurements of jet fragmentation functions reported an excess in yield of hard (large \(z\)) and soft (small \(z\)) fragments and suppression in the region between these two excesses. The excess of soft fragments

Boxes represent magnitude of statistical uncertainty. Open black boxes represent the current precision on the jet \(R_{\mathrm{AA}}\) measurements while blue closed boxes represent a projection of statistical uncertainties towards 10 nb\({}^{-1}\)of Pb+Pb data. Expected precision on the \(R_{\mathrm{AA}}\) measurement is compared with several recent model predictions: Linear Boltzmann Transport model (LBT), three calculations using the Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET), and Effective Quenching model (EQ).

can be explained by the jet quenching process where the lost energy is transferred to soft particles within and around the jet [22, 23]. Gluon-initiated jets are expected to undergo larger energy loss compared to quark-initiated jets and the enhancement of the hard fragments yield may be due to the different relative shapes of the quark and gluon fragmentation functions [17].

The reduction of statistical uncertainties on the ratios of \(R_{D(z)}\) distributions is demonstrated in Fig. 2 where the statistical uncertainties on the measurement using 0.49 nb\({}^{-1}\)of Pb+Pb data are compared to those expected with 10 nb\({}^{-1}\) of Pb+Pb data. The higher luminosity data will significantly improve the precision of the measurement especially of yields of hard fragments that will strongly constrain theoretical models.

As the fraction of quark- and gluon-initiated jets changes with jet rapidity, measurements of the rapidity dependence of jet observables in Pb+Pb collisions are of great interest. Current measurements of the rapidity dependence of jet fragmentation functions in Pb+Pb are statistics-limited [20] and no significant rapidity dependence is observed. The rapidity dependence can be quantified as the ratio of \(R_{D(z)}\) in the rapidity intervals 0.3-0.8 and 1.2-2.1 to the \(|y|<0.3\) reference. This observable benefits from a large cancellation of systematic uncertainties that are to a large extent correlated between rapidity intervals. Figure 3 shows these ratios for jets with \(p_{\rm T}\) in intervals of 126-158 GeV and 200-251 GeV for the most central 0-10% collisions. The ratios are based on the measured distributions in Pb+Pb collisions at 5.02 TeV [21] with the smoothed statistical variations, which are then projected for the integrated luminosity of 10 nb\({}^{-1}\).

The projections are compared to theoretical calculations from Refs. [24] and [17]. The hybrid model [24] for jet quenching uses perturbative techniques for the high \(Q^{2}\) processes in the jet evolution and strong coupling for the low momentum scales associated with the hot QCD matter. The study of the rapidity dependence shows a small enhancement of yields of fragments with low and intermediate \(z\) and reduction of yields of high \(z\) fragments for more forward jets.

Shaded boxes are for 0.49 nb\({}^{-1}\)while vertical error bars are for 10 nb\({}^{-1}\)(many are smaller than the plotted marker size).

### Photon-tagged Jet Measurements

Figure 4 shows the projected statistical uncertainties for measurements of photon-tagged jet fragmentation functions with 10 nb\({}^{-1}\)of Pb+Pb data. The advantage of studying photon-tagged jet fragmentation functions, in contrast to the study of inclusive jets, includes the selection of jets not biased by how much energy the jet has lost, and that the selected sample is dominated by quark-initiated jets. Measurements of this quantity using the 2015 Pb+Pb data are statistics-limited [6]. In that measurement, photon-tagged jet fragmentation functions are found to have a stronger centrality dependence than the inclusive fragmentation functions. However, the limited statistics of the 2015 data necessitated that the analysis be done in very broad centrality selections (0-30% and 30-80%). With the Run 3 and 4 data, one of the highest priority goals would be to repeat this measurement in much finer centrality selections. The projected statistical precision of this measurement for 10 nb\({}^{-1}\)is shown in Figure 4.

## 4 Systematic Uncertainties

To achieve an improvement in the precision of jet measurements, not only statistical uncertainties but also systematic uncertainties will need to be reduced. A full quantitative projection of this improvement is not available at this time, however we discuss expected improvements qualitatively using the inclusive jet fragmentation at high-z and jet structure in the gamma-jet system as examples. The dominant systematic uncertainties for these measurements stem from knowledge of the jet energy scale (JES) and the track reconstruction. For jet spectra measurements, most limiting uncertainties are due to the determination of the nuclear overlap function and the luminosity.

The JES uncertainty is expected to be reduced by general improvements on the proton-proton baseline

Figure 3: Comparison of the ratio of the rapidity selected \(R_{D(z)}\) distributions to the \(R_{D(z)}\) distributions measured in \(|y|<0.3\) and the same quantity evaluated in the hybrid model [24] with a reasonable choice of the resolution parameter (\(R_{\rm res}=3\)) and in the EQ model [17] in 0–10% central collisions for 126–158 GeV (left) and 200–251 GeV (right) jet \(p_{\rm T}\) interval. The comparison to the EQ model is shown only for 126–158 GeV jet \(p_{\rm T}\) interval. The vertical bars on the data points indicate statistical uncertainties. In most cases, the statistical uncertainties are smaller than the marker size.

systematic uncertainties which can be achieved by using large samples of gamma-jet or Z-jet events. Also important for the reduction is the use of MC generators which realistically simulate jet quenching phenomenon. The systematic uncertainty on track reconstruction is expected to be reduced by the use of the upgraded tracker (ITk). To improve the systematic uncertainty on the determination of the nuclear overlap function, data-driven techniques for the centrality determination need to be explored. These include use of the information from inclusive prompt photon, Z and W boson measurements as well as possible use of information from forward detectors. Recent progress in understanding the fluctuating nature of the nucleon-nucleon cross-section as well as factorization of soft and hard processes should also bring improvement to the modeling of centrality [25, 26].

## Summary

This note presents projections for jet measurements using 10 nb\({}^{-1}\)of Pb+Pb data in Runs 3 and 4 with the ATLAS detector. Jet \(R_{\rm AA}\), inclusive jet fragmentation functions and the fragmentation functions of jets opposite a photon are presented. These representative measurements which can be performed with ATLAS are sensitive to the properties of the QGP and can be made with the high luminosity available in the future.

Preliminary data is shown from 0.49 nb\({}^{-1}\)of Pb+Pb collisions with statistical (bars) and systematic uncertainty (shaded boxes) and compared to projected relative statistical uncertainty for 10 nb\({}^{-1}\)of Pb+Pb data in central (_left_) and peripheral (_right_) collisions. Many of the projected points have uncertainty bars smaller than the marker size.
