###### Abstract

Sensitivity to the detection of the Higgs with a mass of 120 \(GeV\) is studied as a function of the center of mass of the colliding protons. The analysis is based on three benchmark channels significant in the low mass region : direct production of Higgs followed by the decay \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and associated production of Higgs with either a W boson or a top quark pair, followed by the decay \(H\to b\overline{b}\). The analysis in each channel follows the steps discussed either in the TDR [1] or in recent ATLAS notes [6, 7]. The study is performed for \(\sqrt{s}\) ranging from 2 \(TeV\) to 16 \(TeV\). While the sensitivity for the \(WH\) channel is found to reach a plateau for \(\sqrt{s}\simeq 8\)\(TeV\), the sensitivity for \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) and \(t\overline{t}H\to l\nu b\overline{b}b\overline{b}X\) increases with increasing center of mass energy. For an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\) the combined sensitivity of the three channels varies almost linearly from 1.2 at \(\sqrt{s}=2\)\(TeV\) to 6.5 at \(\sqrt{s}=16\)\(TeV\).

Introduction

The latest analysis of the data obtained by the four LEP experiments define a lower bound on the SM Higgs mass at \(114.4~{}GeV\) at \(95\%\) confidence level. The evolution of the likelihood used in this analysis show a slight preference for the signal plus background hypothesis in the case of a Higgs mass in the range \(115~{}GeV\) to \(118~{}GeV\)[3]. If this is the region where the Higgs mass lies the search for a Higgs signal could be difficult both at LHC and at Tevatron. In this note a simple study of the Higgs sensitivity as a function of the center of mass energy of the \(pp\) system is carried out. The purpose of this study is to asses how critical the value of \(\sqrt{s}=14~{}TeV\) will be.

The leading-oder production cross sections as a function of the H iggs mass are presented in figure 1 (left), the highest production rate is given by the gluon-gluon fusion process. If the Higgs mass is lower than \(130~{}GeV\) the Higgs branching ratios are dominated by the decay channel \(H\to b\overline{b}\) as it is shown in Figure 1 (right). However the huge QCD background would completely hide a signal in this channel. The production of Higgs in association with either a \(W\) (or \(Z\)) boson or with a \(t\overline{t}\) pair offer the possibility of observing the decay \(H\to b\overline{b}\). In fact the high \(p_{T}\) lepton produced in the decay chain of \(W\) boson or of one of the two top quarks allows to trigger the event and offer a good signature to reject QCD background.

A second possibility, which has always been considered as the golden channel for a Higgs particle of mass \(\simeq 115~{}GeV\), is the direct production of Higgs followed by the decay \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\). The signal to background ratio in this channel is very low thus excellent energy and angular resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter are required in order to observe a narrow peak above the prompt \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum. Moreover a very good jet-photon discrimination power is needed to

highly suppress the QCD background.

In this analysis events have been generated with PYTHIA 6.1, using CTEQ2L structure functions, interfaced to the ATLFAST 2.0, the ATLAS fast detector simulation [5]. All channels have been analyzed for six values of the center of mass energies of the colliding protons i.e.: 2, 6, 8, 11, 14 and 16 TeV. A comparison with previous analysis, at \(\sqrt{s}~{}=~{}14~{}TeV\) shows a very good agreement for the \(\,H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel, while small discrepancies are observed for \(WH\to l\nu b\overline{b}\) and \(t\overline{t}\,H\to l\nu b\overline{b}b\overline{b}X\) channels.

It should be noticed that analysis cuts are not optimized at each energy point, in fact all cuts are kept fixed on the whole energy range. However the set of cuts used are quite simple and mainly driven by the detector acceptance. Where necessary it has been checked that the thresholds chosen for particular cuts gave reasonable enrichment on the whole energy range.

The sensitivity trend obtained in this note is also driven by the particular set of cuts chosen on each channel, changing the set of cuts may result in a different dependence of the sensitivity on the center of mass energy.

The following sections are dedicated to the description of the analysis on \(\,H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\), \(WH\to l\nu b\overline{b}\) and \(t\overline{t}\,H\to l\nu b\overline{b}b\overline{b}X\) while the overall results are summarized in the last section.

## 2 \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) channel

The inclusive production of a low mass Higgs (MSEL = 16) is dominated by the gluon-gluon fusion. The irreducible background to the \(\,H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) is given by prompt \(\gamma\gamma\) production in the following processes : Born \(q\overline{q}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\), Box \(gg\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) and quark bremsstrahlung \(qg\to q\gamma\to q\gamma\gamma\). For the bremsstrahlung events only those events with well isolated photons survive the isolation cut. It has been demonstrated [1] that, after the isolation criteria have been applied, the contribution of these events to background amounts to 50% of the contribution given by the sum of Born and Box processes. This estimate has been calculated at 14 \(TeV\) and in this note has been used for the whole \(\sqrt{s}\) range.

The reducible background is given by \(\gamma-jet\) and \(jet-jet\) production where one or two jets are misidentified as photons. The cross sections dependence on the c.m.e. for signal and backgrounds, including the branching ratios, are shown in figure 2 (left). The cross sections show an approximately linear dependence as a function \(\sqrt{s}\). The cross sections of reducible backgrounds, \(\gamma-jet\) and \(jet-jet\), are larger than those for \(\gamma\gamma\) by 3 and 7 order of magnitude respectively. It is thus clear that the most important ingredients in this analysis are the correct evaluation of the photon/jet separation, which allows to estimate the rejection of QCD background, and of the photon energy resolution, which allows to evaluate the significance of the signal peak on \(\gamma\gamma\) invariant mass plot. Both these aspects have been extensively studied and discussed in the TDR and the results obtainedthere are used also in this analysis.

The selection criteria are the same used in the TDR and consist of simple kinematic cuts. At the first step two isolated photons (as defined by ATLFAST) are selected as Higgs decay candidates. The following cuts are then applied in order to improve the signal to background ratio :

* the two photons are required to have \(p_{T}>40~{}GeV\) and \(p_{T}~{}>~{}25~{}GeV\) respectively;
* both photons are required to be in the pseudorapidity interval \(|\eta|<2.4\);
* events with any photons in the region of the electromagnetic barrel/end-cap transition region (\(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\)) are rejected;
* the \(\gamma\gamma\) invariant mass is required to be within \(\pm 1.4\sigma\) the Higgs mass, where \(\sigma=1.2~{}GeV\).

The \(p_{T}\) thresholds chosen for the highest and second highest \(p_{T}\) photons optimize the signal enrichment on the whole \(\sqrt{s}\) range.

The photon identification efficiency is taken to be 80% while the jet misidentification is assumed to vary linearly between 1/1200 at \(p_{T}=20~{}GeV\) and 1/3200 at \(p_{T}=50~{}GeV\) and to saturate at 1/3200 for higher \(p_{T}\) values.

The most copious background, after all analysis cuts have been applied, is the

direct \(\gamma\gamma\) production. The dependence of the sensitivity and of the signal to background ratio on the \(\sqrt{s}\) are shown in figure 2 (full circles) for an integrated luminosity of \(30\ fb^{-1}\) considering ATLAS only. Errors are statistical only and are always smaller than \(5\%\). In the same figure are also shown the sensitivity and signal to background ratio at \(\sqrt{s}=14TeV\) as quoted on the TDR (open circle). At \(\sqrt{s}=14TeV\) the sensitivity obtained in the present analysis 3.9 coincides with the value quoted in the TDR.

The variation of the efficiency for signal and background on the full \(\sqrt{s}\) range is within \(50\%\). The sensitivity dependence is thus essentially determined by the linear cross section increase of both the signal and the \(\gamma\gamma\) background.

## 3 \(Wh,h\to b\bar{b}\) channel

In this channel the \(W\) boson produced in association with Higgs boson is required to decay leptonically. The high \(p_{T}\) lepton \((e,\mu)\) allows then to trigger the event and provides a good rejection against QCD background. The irreducible backgrounds to this channel are the associated production of \(WZ\) with subsequent decay \(Z\to b\bar{b}\) and direct production of \(Wb\bar{b}\). Contributions to the reducible background are given by : \(Wjj\), where two light jets are misidentified as \(b\) jets; \(t\bar{t}\to WWb\bar{b}\) with at least one leptonic decay of the \(W\) and single top production in association with another jet(s).

The correct evaluation of the \(Wjj\) and \(Wbb\) background is still an open question. Various Montecarlo based on matrix element calculation or parton shower are available to generate \(Wbb\) events and at present work is going on with the two approaches to assess a reliable estimate of the \(Wjj\) and \(Wbb\) backgrounds. The present uncertainty on the absolute contribution of these backgrounds may be within a factor \(\simeq 2\). The factors that determine these uncertainty are completely correlated at different center of mass energies thus the shape of the cross section dependence on the c.m.e. will also suffer of a scale factor indetermination.

In the present study \(Wjj\) background has been generated with PYTHIA via the two processes : \(qg\to Wq\) (ISUB=31) and \(q\bar{q}\to Wg\) (ISUB=16) including initial

and final state radiation and requiring \(p_{T}^{hard}~{}>~{}10~{}GeV\). The dependence of the cross sections time branching ratios on \(\sqrt{s}\) for signal and background are shown in figure 3 both in logarithmic (left) and linear scale (right). The generated event samples for each value of \(\sqrt{s}\) are listed in table 1. In the same table the cross sections at \(\sqrt{s}=\) 14 \(TeV\) are also listed. The analysis procedure repeats the steps discussed in ATLAS note [6] :

* one muon or electron having \(p_{T}>\) 20 GeV and \(|\eta|<\) 2.4 is required as triggering lepton;
* events containing other leptons having \(p_{T}>\) 6 GeV and \(|\eta|<\) 2.5 are vetoed in order to reject \(Zjj\), \(Zbb\) and \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds;
* two \(b\) jets are required as Higgs decay candidates;
* events with other jets with \(p_{T}>\) 30 GeV are rejected to decrease \(t\overline{t}\) background;
* the \(b\overline{b}\) invariant mass is required to be within 2\(\sigma\) of the Higgs mass; the \(\sigma\) value being 10% of the Higgs mass.

The \(p_{T}\) threshold on \(b\) jets at reconstruction level is 10 \(GeV\) corresponding to \(p_{T}>\) 15 \(GeV\) when \(p_{T}\) calibration is applied. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency is assumed to be 60% with a misidentification probability for \(c\)-jets and light jets of 0.1 and 0.01 respectively. The \(p_{T}\) threshold used for the jet-veto gives good signal enrichment at all energies.

The final number of events expected for an integrated luminosity 30 \(fb^{-1}\) are shown in figure 4 (left) as a function of the center of mass energy.

The most copious background is given by \(Wjj\) consisting, at all energies, by about 70% real \(Wbb\) events where the \(b\)-jets are generated in initial or final state radiation and by about \(30\%\,Wbj\) and \(Wjj\) events with \(j=u,d,s,c\) where one or two jets are misidentified.

The sensitivity and the signal to background ratio are shown in figure 4 (right, full circles), in this plots the contribution of single top and bottom production is added as 10% of the \(Wjj\) background as indicated by the results quoted in reference [6]. Errors are statistical only and are smaller than 5% on the full \(\sqrt{s}\) range. The sensitivity for this channel shows an effect of saturation for \(\sqrt{s}>8\ TeV\).

A detailed comparison with a previous analysis of this channel is shown in table 2 where the single cut efficiencies are listed for both analysis. The expected number of events for samples \(WH\), \(WZ\) and \(t\overline{t}\) after all analysis cuts have been applied are in good agreement between the two analysis. The single cut efficiencies agree within the 10%. The main discrepancy is found in the predicted number of events for \(Wjj\) background that is about 30% lower in this analysis. This discrepancy could be due to different versions of PYTHIA used in the two analysis : PYTHIA 5.7 for the analysis of ref. [6] and PYTHIA 6.1 in the present analysis. The sensitivity obtained in reference [6] at \(\sqrt{s}=14\ TeV\) is also shown

in figure 4 (top right, open circle).

The evaluation of the sensitivity shown on figure 4 assumes a perfect knowledge of the background shape, in order to be able to evaluate a very small excess of events on the background. Even under this optimistic assumption, it has been shown that the sensitivity does not exceed 2.5. To better understand how much the uncertainty on the precise knowledge of background shape would affect the sensitivity, this is reevaluated including a systematic uncertainty of 5% o on the number of expected \(Wbb\) background events. In this case the sensitivity is reduced considerably and is almost constant (figure 4, top-right, triangles) on the full energy range.

The \(\sqrt{s}\) dependence of the sensitivity is of course due to the global effect of the \(\sqrt{s}\) dependence of cross sections and of the efficiencies for signal and background. In particular each analysis cut will show a different \(\sqrt{s}\) dependence. To understand the main factors determining the sensitivity dependence on \(\sqrt{s}\) the contribution given by cross sections and by efficiencies have been studied separately. The sensitivity variation determined by cross section only is presented in figure 5 (left, open circles) for an integrated luminosity \(L=30~{}fb^{-1}\) and for constant efficiencies calculated at \(14~{}TeV\). In the same figure is also shown the sensitivity obtained with full calculation (full circles). The comparison between the two curves shows that the cross section variation does not completely account for the sensitivity dependence.

The single cut efficiencies for the \(WH\) sample have been studied as a function of

the center of mass energy (E) using the variables \(\alpha_{i}\), defined as :

\[\alpha_{i}(E)=\frac{\epsilon_{i}(E)-\epsilon_{i}(16)}{\epsilon_{i}(16)} \tag{1}\]

where \(\epsilon_{i}(E)\) and \(\epsilon_{i}(16)\) are the efficiencies for cut \(i\) at \(\sqrt{s}=16\;TeV\) and \(\sqrt{s}=E\) respectively. Figure 5 (right) shows \(\alpha_{i}\) as a function of the center of mass energy for each cut. Three cuts show a clear \(\sqrt{s}\) dependence : trigger selection, \(b\) jet tagging and the jet veto. The variation of the efficiencies of the first two cuts is determined by the \(\eta\) acceptance of the detector : at increasing center of mass energy events are produced more and more in the forward region thus the probability to miss the triggering lepton or one of the \(b\) jets increases. The efficiency of the jet veto is instead mainly driven by the increase of the jet multiplicity and by the hardening of the jet spectrum as the center of mass energy increases. The sensitivity calculated using cross sections and signal efficiency dependent on the energy but with fixed background efficiencies is shown in figure 5 (left - triangles). This calculation reproduces the full sensitivity calculation within 10% indicating that the variation of the background efficiencies give a small contribution to the variation of the sensitivity as a function of \(\sqrt{s}\).

The effect of sensitivity saturation around \(\sqrt{s}=8\;TeV\), is then due to two competing factors : the cross section variation which produce an almost linear increase in sensitivity (that is the signal cross section increases but the back

ground cross sections increase faster) and the signal efficiency decrease. The net result is a flattening of the sensitivity dependence at high center of mass energy.

## 4 \(t\bar{t}H\) channel

The production cross section of Higgs in association to a top quark pair is lower than the \(WH\) associated production cross section (figure 1), however the presence of top decay products in the final state produce a clear signature which can be exploited to reduce the background. The full decay chain is :

\[t\bar{t}H\to W^{+}b\ W^{-}\overline{b}\ b\bar{b}\to l(e\mu)\nu b\bar{b}b\bar{b}X \tag{2}\]

one of the \(W\)'s boson is required to decay into a muon or electron. The irreducible backgrounds in this search are given by \(t\bar{t}b\overline{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}Z,Z\to b\overline{b}\), while the reducible background consists of \(t\bar{t}jj\) and \(Wjjj\) events. The number of events expected from \(t\bar{t}Z,Z\to b\overline{b}\) after all analysis cuts is completely negligible [7] so this background will not be considered. The cross section dependence on \(\sqrt{s}\) for signal and for backgrounds are shown in figure 6 (left).

The event selection, based on the analysis steps described in reference[7],

requires :

* one isolated lepton with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.4\);

Figure 6: Cross sections for signal and background (left) and sensitivity (right)for \(t\bar{t}\) channel for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\). All samples have been generated requiring \(p_{T}^{hard}\ >\ 1\ GeV\).

* four jets tagged as b-jets (_b_ tagging efficiency 0.6, \(c\) mistag probability 0.1, other jets mistag probability 0.01);
* invariant mass of b-jet pair within \(\sigma_{bb}\) of nominal \(m_{H}\).

The threshold required on the lepton \(p_{T}\) is too low when considering the new level 1 trigger thresholds defined in the framework of deferrals in fact single isolated electrons are now triggered if \(p_{T}~{}>~{}25~{}GeV\) and single isolated muons if \(p_{T}~{}>~{}20~{}GeV\). However this study has been carried out using the cuts listed above in order to be able to use results obtained previously while the impact of the increased trigger thresholds at \(\sqrt{s}~{}=~{}14~{}TeV\) on this and other channels is the subject of many ongoing studies.

The set of cuts described above correspond to the the simplest selection carried out on this channel and described in reference [7] where is referred to as 'naive selection'. In the same reference other more advanced selections are also described, in particular the analysis where the final state is fully reconstructed. An inclusive analysis, like the 'naive selection' here described, is simpler but reaches not only a slightly lower sensitivity but also a much lower signal purity and signal to background ratio, for this reason the exclusive analysis has been chosen as baseline for the TDR [1]. However since the motivation of the study here described is to understand the sensitivity trend as a function of the center of mass energy it has been chosen to carry out this study with the simplest possible selection. It should be noticed that each particular selection might show a different sensitivity trend depending on which are the cuts have strong center of mass dependence.

For the \(WH\) channel the factors that determine the sensitivity dependence on \(\sqrt{s}\) have been discussed in the previous section and they are the cross section and the signal efficiency. It has been shown that if only these two factors are considered (constant background efficiency) the sensitivity of the full \(WH\) analysis is reproduced within 10%. Since the analysis steps for \(t\overline{t}H\) 'naive' selection are very similar to those applied in the \(WH\) analysis the sensitivity dependence on \(\sqrt{s}\) may be obtained rescaling the signal and background events obtained at 14 \(TeV\) by the cross section and the signal efficiency for trigger and b-jet selection as described in the previous section. The sensitivity is thus calculated as :

\[\frac{S}{\sqrt{N}}=\frac{L\cdot\sigma_{ttH}(E)\cdot\epsilon_{ttH}^{tot}\left( \mbox{\it 14}\right)\cdot C_{\epsilon}(E)}{\sqrt{L\cdot\sigma_{\mbox{\it Wjj}}(E) \cdot\epsilon_{\mbox{\it Wjj}}^{tot}\left(\mbox{\it 14}\right)+\sigma_{tt}(E) \cdot\epsilon_{tt}^{tot}\left(\mbox{\it 14}\right)}} \tag{3}\]

where \(L\) is the integrated luminosity, \(E\) is the center of mass energy, \(\sigma(E)\) are the cross sections for signal and backgrounds, \(C_{\epsilon}(E)\) is a correction factor which takes into account the dependence of signal efficiency on \(E\) :

\[C_{\epsilon}(E)=\frac{\epsilon_{ttH}^{trig}(E)\cdot\epsilon_{ttH}^{tb}(E)}{ \epsilon_{ttH}^{trig}\left(\mbox{\it 14}\right)\cdot\epsilon_{ttH}^{tb}\left( \mbox{\it 14}\right)} \tag{4}\]where \(\epsilon^{trig}(E)\) and \(\epsilon^{tb}(E)\) are the efficiency of the trigger selection and of the 4 b-jets requirement as a function of \(E\); \(\epsilon^{tot}(14)\) are the total efficiency of the whole analysis for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV as obtained in memo [7] :

\[\epsilon^{tot}_{ttH}(14)=0.01768\quad\epsilon^{tot}_{wj}(14)=0.518\times 10^{-6 }\quad\epsilon^{tot}_{ttj}(14)=4.2\times 10^{-9} \tag{5}\]

The requirement of four b-tagged jets strongly suppresses the \(W+jets\) background and after the selection the \(ttjj\) correspond to about 95% of the total background. The sensitivity dependence on \(\sqrt{s}\) is shown in figure 6 (right). We notice that the sensitivity does not show a saturation effect in this channel. In fact in this case the sensitivity is completely dominated by the cross section variation and the correction factor \(C_{\epsilon}(E)\) which accounts for the variation of the signal efficiency for trigger and b-tagging is almost constant. In this channel events are mostly produced centrally also at high energy since a high fraction of the center of mass energy is spent for the masses of the final state particles thus the acceptance cut in this case does not play a crucial role. In figure 6 is also shown the sensitivity at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)\(TeV\) obtained in reference [7] 3.2 (open circle), in the case of 'naive' analysis, to be compared with 2.6 of the present analysis. The difference is due to a small discrepancy in the \(ttH\) cross section : 0.152 \(pB\) in the present analysis and 0.2 \(pB\) in the analysis of reference [7].

## 5 Conclusions

The sensitivity dependence on \(\sqrt{s}\) has been obtained for the channels relevant to the discovery of Higgs with mass equal to 120 \(GeV\). The total sensitivity has been calculated combining the three channels and is shown in figure 7 (left) together with the single channel sensitivities for an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\). The \(WH\) channel is the only one that shows sensitivity saturation. The global sensitivity at \(\sqrt{s}>8\)\(TeV\) is essentially driven by the \(H\gamma\gamma\) and \(ttH\) channels. The global sensitivity varies almost linearly over the \(\sqrt{s}\) range studied and at \(\sqrt{s}=14\)\(TeV\) is 5.55. Since the uncertainty on the knowledge of the background shape could result in a serious loss of sensitivity on the \(WH\) channel, the total sensitivity has also been calculated excluding this channel (fig. 7, blue curve, asterisks). In this case the sensitivity at 14 \(TeV\) decreases to 4.83.

The signal to background ratio for each channel is shown in figure 7 (right). At high center of mass energy the best signal to background ratio is given by the \(t\bar{t}H\to l\nu b\bar{b}b\bar{b}X\) channel. In this channel a signal to background ratio a factor more than three higher is reached if a more exclusive analysis, as the one carried out as baseline for the TDR [1], is carried out.
