# Search for a \(W^{\prime}\) in the \(l\nu\) channel

M.C Cousinou - C.P.P.M Marseille

This note describes a feasibility study for the observation of a \(W^{\prime}\) in ATLAS. The \(W^{\prime}\) model used is the Extended Gauge Model [1] which is implemented in the event generator program PYTHIA and the \(W^{\prime}\) study is performed for the \(W^{\prime}\to l\nu\) channel.

## 1 Detector simulation

A rough simulation of calorimeters is done. They cover a range of \((\pm 2.8)\) in rapidity. The EM calorimeter is segmented in pseudorapidity-azimuthal angle space in cells of: \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.02*0.02\) and the hadronic one in \(0.05*0.05\). The energy of each particle entering the calorimeters is smeared as : \(\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{10\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 0.5\%\) for electrons and photons and \(\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{50\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 2\%\) for hadrons. The measurement of the muons momenta is simulated according to the air-core toroid with an inner tracking resolution, as described in the ATLAS LoI [2]. No extra efficiency factor for identifying the leptons is added.

In order to compute the missing transverse energy, a jet reconstruction is done. Starting from the transverse energy \(E_{T}\) deposited in each cell of the calorimeters (summed over all particles inside this cell) a search for clusters with \(E_{T}>10GeV\) within a clustering radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}<0.4\) is performed.

## 2 Event generation

The events are generated using PYTHIA (version 5.7) [5][6] and JETSET (version 7.4) [4] at an CM energy of 14 TeV and with a top mass equal to 170 GeV. Two backgrounds are considered: \(W\longrightarrow l\nu\) and \(t\overline{t}\). As it is rather computer time consuming to generate enough events at high lepton-neutrino transverse mass, samples of events starting from different thresholds for two kinematical variables : \(\hat{s}\) of the partonic reaction and \(\hat{p_{t}}\) of the hard \(2\to 2\) processes ( respectively calledCKIN(1) and CKIN(3) in PYTHIA) are generated and the distributions of these runs of events are combined such that in each interval of transverse mass only the statistically most relevant sample is taken. This allows to define an envelope which is then used to estimate the number of background events. As an example the result achieved for the W background is shown on fig. 1, on which all the distributions are plotted, as well as the resulting envelope. For each mass value the \(W^{\prime}\) is generated with a \(\hat{s}\) threshold equal to \(M(W^{\prime})-3\times\Gamma(W^{\prime})\).

A pile-up of 40 minimum bias events (on average) is added in the \(W^{\prime}\) generation. Since it is ten times longer to generate events with pile-up, it has not been included in the background simulation. But a comparison of the shape of the transverse mass with and without pile-up has been done for one of the samples of events generated for the \(W\longrightarrow e\nu\) background. The result is shown in fig. 2 : no significant difference is seen.

## 3 Signal and background results

This analysis starts from results obtained for the Aachen workshop [3]. In particular the choice of the best cuts to select the \(W^{\prime}\) events over the background has not been redone. These cuts are : \(P_{t}(l)\geq 200GeV\), \(E_{t}^{miss}\geq 200GeV\). An additional isolation cut reduces strongly the \(t\bar{t}\) background at high transverse mass. \((E_{iso}\leq 12GeV\) for the signal which has been generated with pile-up and \(E_{iso}\leq 2GeV\) for the background ). In fig. 3 are shown the signal and backgrounds for the channel \(W^{\prime}\longrightarrow e\nu\) and different \(W^{\prime}\) masses, with and without having applied the cuts.

To extract the number of signal and background events, an additional cut on the transverse mass \((p_{t}(l)-E_{t}^{miss})\) is applied. The value of this last cut depends on the \(W^{\prime}\) mass. The expected number of events per LHC year (for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\ pb^{-1}\) ) is summarised in table 1.

The same distributions are presented on fig. 4 for the channel \(W^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu\nu\). As shown from the study of the electron channel, the \(t\bar{t}\) background is small compared to the \(W\)-boson background, at least for high values of the transverse mass. This background has therefore not been considered in the muon channel. Table 2 summarized the expected rates after cuts.

From these results the detection of a \(W^{\prime}\) decaying in \(l\nu\) looks feasible up to a mass of about 6 TeV (at least for a production cross-section \((\sigma*Br(W^{\prime}\to l\nu))\) running from 6 pb for a \(W^{\prime}\) mass of 1 TeV to about 6 fb for a mass of 4 TeV ). The transverse mass distribution for a \(W^{\prime}\) mass of 4 TeV is plotted, as an example, on fig. 5 together with simulation of the number of events observed for one year of data-taking at a luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) on the figure 6.

The effect of the \(\eta\) staging decreases when the \(W^{\prime}\) mass increases and is negligeable for masses greater than 3 TeV.

## 4 Precision on \(W^{\prime}\) mass measurement

A comparison of the "experimental" transverse mass distribution of fig. 6 to transverse mass plots corresponding to different \(W^{\prime}\) masses allows to work out the precision with which the \(W^{\prime}\) mass could be measured. A distance \(D(M)\) is computed as:

\[D^{2}(M)=\sum\frac{(N_{i}(4TeV)-N_{i}(M))^{2}}{N_{i}(M)}\]

where \(N_{i}(4TeV)\) is the number of events in bin i of the "experimental" distribution and \(N_{i}(M)\) the number of events in bin i of the transverse mass distribution generated for a \(W^{\prime}\) of mass M. The most probable values of these distances have been obtained by simulating 1000 "experimental" distributions and are plotted on fig. 7 in function of M. From this plot a precision of the order of \(\pm 100GeV\) can be inferred. A similar study done for a \(W^{\prime}\) mass of 2 TeV gives a precision of about 30 to 40 GeV. (see fig. 7).

## 5 Forward-backward asymmetry

In order to be able to get the forward-backward asymmetry of the \(W^{\prime}\) it is necessary to know the charge of the lepton and the momentum of the \(W^{\prime}\) (i.e the momentum of the neutrino). For the charge the assumption has been done than it can be determined if \(\frac{\Delta P_{\perp}}{P_{\perp}}\) is better than 100%. The transverse missing energy measurement gives the transverse momentum of the neutrino. An estimation of the longitudinal one is extracted by solving a second order equation, equation obtained by forcing the square of the sum of the quadrimomenta of the lepton and the neutrino to be equal to the square of the nominal \(W^{\prime}\) mass. Most of the time this equation admits two solutions and in that case the solution which minimizes the Feynman variable \(x_{W}\) of the \(W^{\prime}\) is kept.

On fig. 8 and 9 the differential asymmetries are plotted for the electron channel and a \(W^{\prime}\) mass of 3 TeV and 1 TeV respectively. On each plot a comparison is done of the theoretical values of this asymmetry and the measured values. The error bars correspond to one year of data taking at a luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

The distorsion of the asymmetry comes from the events which admit 2 solutions for the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino. For the proportion of 2 solutions events for which the solution kept gives the right classification as backward or forward depends on the \(W^{\prime}\) rapidity and is different for backward and forward events. This is visible on fig. 10 on which this distribution is displayed as an example for the \(W^{\prime}\)+. Futhermore even when the solution kept gives the right classification the measured \(W^{\prime}\) rapidity could fall in a different rapidity interval than the true one. That is shown on fig. 11 on which the proportion of events with a correct \(Y_{W}\) is presented. Finally the main reason which makes the amount of the asymmetry distorsion bigger at 1 TeV is that the percentage of events with 2 solutions is bigger at 1 TeV than at 3 TeV (see fig. 12 ).

On fig. 8 and 9 the data marked with a star correspond to the results obtained when the real values of the emomentum and of the neutrino transverse momentum are kept, but the longitudinal neutrino momentum is extracted as described before. From the similarity between these results and those obtain from the measured events one can see that it will be possible to correct for this distorsion.

Conclusion

The channel \(W^{\prime}\to l\nu\) will allow an easy \(W^{\prime}\) detection up to a mass of about 6 TeV in one year of running of LHC at an energy of 14 TeV and a luminosity of \(10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). This upper limit will be around 4.5 TeV in case of LHC running at 10 TeV with a luminosity of \(10^{33}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) as it is shown on fig. 13 on which the number of events observed for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}pb^{-1}\) is plotted as a function of the \(W^{\prime}\) mass.
