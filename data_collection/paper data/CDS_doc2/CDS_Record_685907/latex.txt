## 1 Introduction

The Inner Detector Review Panel and Steering Group requested the authors of this document to compare the MSGC and silicon technologies in the ATLAS forward precision tracking. This note represents the consensus of the authors, and not necessarily the views of the MSGC and silicon communities.

We make a performance and cost comparison using the post-Annecy MSGC layout [1], using a direct replacement of the MSGC detectors with silicon detectors covering the same area.

In Section 2, we describe the post-Annecy layout for the MSGC's, and note the assumptions made in making a comparison with silicon. We then consider the major performance specifications, with comments on the ability of silicon to meet the specifications imposed on the MSGC's. Finally a cost comparison is made. Following our oral presentation [3] the MSGC baseline has changed. We have not attempted a direct silicon replacement of this new MSGC layout which is rapidly evolving.

## 2 The ATLAS Inner Tracker; the post-Annecy baseline.

Figure 1 shows the post-Annecy geometry of the ATLAS Inner Tracking Detector, as reproduced by the GEANT package. The detector consists of 10 wheels of MSGC detectors in each of the forward and backward directions, in the radial range \(40<R<60\) cm. These wheels cover a surface area of 12.56 m\({}^{2}\) (single sided silicon area 25.12 m\({}^{2}\)). At each end, two additional large wheels in the radial range \(50<R<100\) cm provide pattern recognition capability and good momentum resolution in the extreme forward and backward directions, \(1.9<\eta<2.5\). The wheels cover an area of 2.36 m\({}^{2}\) each, a total of 9.42 m\({}^{2}\).

The following comments are appropriate:

* For both the MSGC and silicon, the large wheels are expensive (see Section 2.2) and the baseline layout of two wheels at each end can be disputed. We have therefore costed the end wheels separately, for both MSGC and silicon substrates.
* The base-line choice of 3 MSGC substrates per wheel is motivated by the requirement of good tracking efficiency and pattern recognition. Recent test-beam measurements indicate (using a \(\sim\)75 nsec integration time and a 3.2mm drift gap), a hit efficiency of 98% for a noise rate of 0.11% [2]. In the case of silicon, this is effectively 100%; it is therefore appropriate to use 2 silicon layers (u,v) per wheel. Subsequent geometric and dead-strip inefficiencies must be added, for both substrate solutions.
* The MSGC keystone-geometry baseline uses 210 \(\mu\)m strip pitch. The most direct replacement is for nominal 207 \(\mu\)m mean pitch DC-coupled silicon detectors (256 channels per wafer, for a maximum of 60 mm width and radial geometry). These detectors have been developed (apart from key-stone geometry) within the RD2 collaboration [4] and have been costed by CORE [5].

Figure 1: ATLAS Inner Tracking Detector geometry.

* In the MSGC option, substrates of 10*10 cm\({}^{2}\) and 10*14 cm\({}^{2}\) area have been assumed. For each module, 3 hybrids must be used for the signal collection etc. For the case of silicon, 4" wafers have been used. Back-to-back single-sided silicon wafers are assumed, with a single hybrid stuffed on each side with readout and control chips.

Table 1 summarizes the number of modules and wafers for each type of wheel, in the silicon and MSGC cases. Overlap and wastage due to the silicon substrate wafer size have been taken into account. These modular units provide the basis of subsequent costings.

Table 2 summarizes the number of electronic channels assumed in the subsequent comparisons, and as well the number of ceramic hybrids expected to be used.

### Performance specifications of the silicon backup.

It is necessary to demonstrate that any silicon backup retains the agreed performance specifications of the MSGC layout.

#### 2.1.1 Material.

On the basis of existing barrel silicon module studies, the total radiation length per wheel is estimated to be \(<\) 1.43 %. This is significantly less than the estimate of 2.8-3.0 % for a single MSGC wheel, using the S8900 glass. Table 3 summarizes the contributions to radiation length from different components of the wheels, averaged over the wheel. The conclusion is unaffected by some 'lumpiness' of the material distribution in each option. We are confident that the radiation length per MSGC wheel can be substantially reduced, but remark that this requires further development.

Table 3: Radiation length of MSGC or silicon wheels: Annecy layout.

Figure 2 shows the total traversed radiation length as a function of radius, along lines of fixed \(\eta\) in the radial range 40 \(<R<\) 60 cm, for a configuration almost identical to the post-Annecy layout (in fact the post-Marseille MSGC layout).The solid lines indicate the traversed material for the case of MSGC detectors; the MSGC's contribute typically 13 % rl. to a total thickness within the active tracking region of approx. 40-45 %. (however this reaches 70 % in the region \(|\eta|\)=1.8. The total traversed material will be reduced by approximately 7 % if the silicon option is used. It is noted that the MSGC's provide an important but not dominant contribution to the total material thickness of the Inner Detector.

#### 2.1.2 Radiation damage projections and ageing.

A major concern for both MSGC's and the silicon backup solution, is the effect of ageing and radiation damage. In the case of MSGC's, the ageing has been shown to be sensitive to the gas mixture and to the cleanliness and metallization of substrate manufacture and assembly. For MSGC's ageing measurements have been made with X-ray exposures over small areas for the baseline design. S8900 glass has also been exposed to a neutron flux of \(10^{14}cm^{-2}\) with no measurable change in resistivity. However extensive radiation studies have not yet been performed. In the case of silicon, extensive measurements with neutrons and charged particles have enabled a quantitative assessment of the expected radiation damage and the consequent operating conditions. In each case, radiation damage and ageing remain major concerns.

The Inner Detector layout includes the existence of a silicon layer at radius R = 30 cm in the

Earrel region. It is therefore logical that silicon with the same radiation damage characteristics is a viable detector substrate in regions having less dose. Figure 3 shows the total (charged and neutral) damage as evaluated by Gorfine [6] and normalized to the equivalent 1 MeV neutron flux. This evaluation is for no barrel moderator and a 5 cm end moderator, but it does not yet account for the latest forward calorimeter design [7]. This plot differs from that of draft versions of this note in the use of a 5 cm moderator, and increased statistics. Figure 4 shows the associated depletion voltage of 300 \(\mu m\) thick silicon detectors, after 10 years according to the'standard' LHC operational scenario [8]. In a direct replacement of MSGC's with a silicon substrate, the integrated fluence is not greater than that of the 30 cm barrel layer.

More recent calculations by Gorfine, in good agreement with calculations by Ferrari [9] have postulated draft versions of this note, and take full account of the new Integrated Forward Calorimeter. The total damage as evaluated by Gorfine is shown in Figure 5. In this case, the neutron flux has increased by more than a factor 2, which is a concern for all detectors. The flux at radius 50 cm at the end wheel now slightly exceeds that of the 30 cm barrel region. A 10 cm moderator thickness in this region should be investigated.

#### 2.1.3 Charge collection.

In the case of silicon, almost full charge collection is obtained within one bunch crossing, for fully depleted detectors having an operating voltage exceeding 60V ( for damaged detectors, the depletion voltage will exceed this value). It is therefore possible to use low-noise fast-shaping preamplifiers of rise time less than 1 bunch spacing. In the case of MSGC's, the charge collection is determined by the gas mobility, the gas gain, the chamber thickness, and the substrate material. At least 2 bunch crossings are required to collect the charge in existing MSGC designs; this necessitates a different electronic design for MSGC's, and possibly (depending on the gas gain and the primary ionization) more stringent signal:noise requirements than for silicon. This may also limit the bunch tagging efficiency; nevertheless, a 99 % tagging efficiency has been simulated.

#### 2.1.4 Momentum resolution.

Figure 6 shows the expected momentum resolution for using the program TRKERR for both the MSGC and silicon solutions. We have intentionally not taken account of the TRT capability to emphasize the precision tracking. In the case of the silicon backup we assume 2 measurements per wheel of accuracy 60\(\mu\)m. In the case of the MSGC solution, 3 measurements of this accuracy are assumed. The momentum measurement capability of the two options is essentially identical, subject to design performance.

We note that MSGC single-plane spatial resolutions down to 35 microns have been measured by ATLAS in testbeam studies; similar spatial resolutions are measured from silicon detectors of equivalent read-out pitch, and so the assumed accuracy of 60\(\mu\)m can be considered to be worst-case and to include all survey systematics for both options.

#### 2.1.5 Effect of magnetic field.

In particular because of the short solenoid coil length, the effect of Lorentz shift on both the MSGC and silicon substrates is a function of the counter position and varies to a limited level across the area of a single detector. For MSGC's a detailed Monte Carlo simulation indicates that the resolution is expected to degrade by about 10 microns. No equivalent simulation for the silicon exists. We expect that the deterioration of spatial accuracy is similar for each case.

#### 2.1.6 Robustness.

The MSGC version is designed with 3 layers, u,v,and phi, per disk to improve the point finding and pattern recognition capabilities given the presence of dead strips, geometrical dead regions, less than 100% detection efficiency, and effects of noise.

Silicon detectors intrinsically have close to 100% detection efficiency and lend themselves more readily to designs with almost no geometrical dead area, but do have some dead strips and noise contributions. We expect, however, that the effects of these will smaller than for MSGC's and it would not be cost effective to build in 50% more layers to compensate.

We have some concern at the level of occupancy, including noise effects, in both versions. Even in the post-Annecy layout, the subject of this comparison, where the strip lengths and pitches are similar, the occupancy of the MSGC will be higher than that for the silicon. This is due to the longer charge collection time in MSGC's, 2 bunch crossings, and some saturated pulses inherent to all gas detectors. Alternative layouts for both MSGC and Silicon detectors which are optimised for cost will, almost by definition, have the longest strip length possible. These optimisations will exacerbate the occupancy problem. Because of the large aspect ratio of MSGC detector thickness to strip pitch, the charge of inclined tracks is spread over many strips. Test beam studies demonstrate that MSGC's have reduced sensitivity to inclined tracks [10]; this will reduce somewhat the effective MSGC occupancy.

However, due to the lack of relevant tools at the present time, the effects of the above on pattern recognition, and hence physics, have not been quantified.

### Cost estimate of the MSGC detector, and the silicon backup.

Table 4 summarizes our current estimate for electronics cost, for each of the MSGC and silicon options. The numbers have been evaluated for the case of an on-chip digitization, together with a bipolar front-end. The numbers reflect current estimates of the SCT community for the barrel silicon, and moves towards a standardized costing procedure.

* If binary readout is chosen as a viable solution for either silicon or MSGC options, the quoted electronics costs will reduce by an estimated 15 % [11]. The use of pure analog readout would increase the cost by about approximately 30 %.
* All electronics items (excluding crates, power supplies and cables) have been costed with a 20 % wastage.

Table 5 summarizes our current estimate for the total detector cost. This estimate differs slightly from that presented orally, because of the removal of contingency from the main items, and a better understanding of the MSGC costing by the MSGC community.

* Silicon detector costs have been made, assuming 300 \(\mu\)m thick DC-coupled detectors, on the basis of written estimates from reputable commercial manufacturers (in fact 15% higher than those estimates); DC-coupled detectors are the most direct replacement for MSGC's. If AC-coupled detectors are used, then this item should be increased by 25 %. The silicon cost is sensitive to the technology used, and this is being discussed within the SCT group. The MSGC substrates have been costed on the basis of 20 % of existing fabrication costs, and using a 100 CHF base price for material. We note that this is approximately twice the target CMS cost [12], but comment that this item is not a dominant or determinant cost item. A 20 % wastage is assumed.

\end{table}
Table 4: Electronics cost.

* Hybrid costs have been estimated on the basis of CDF and Delphi costs, for ceramic hybrids with thin-film printing. In each case, this could be reduced by an estimated 30 % by the use of conventional multi-layer techniques, but at the expense of material thickness and rigidity. A 20 % wastage has been added to this item.
* Power supply and cable costs have been scaled on the basis of a unit cost per module. No account is taken of the increased number of supply lines in the case of MSGC's. Our power supply estimates are very uncertain.
* Clean room facilities have been costed identically for MSGC's and for silicon, on the basis of 2500 CHF \(m^{-2}\) at 3 assembly locations.

In the case of the post-Annecy layout, which includes 3 MSGC layers per wheel, there is no price advantage with respect to a silicon substrate backup. This may not be the case with other layouts. Put simply, the cost is determined by

* differences in the number of electronics channels at approximately 3CHF per channel which dominate any price difference (to be weighed against occupancy and efficiency considerations),
* an area-dependent overhead for silicon substrates (approx. 3 MCHF) that is included in the above price estimate,
* an overhead for MSGC detectors from gas and other items (approx. 1-1.5 MCHF) that is included in the table above, and
* possible additional overheads for MSGC development which have not been included in our estimate.

## 3 Summary.

On the basis of the post-Annecy layout, and with the pricing algorithms used here, the cost of the forward precision tracker for ATLAS is not significantly dependent on the choice of silicon or MSGC detector technologies. On the basis of the currently proposed MSGC substrate and layout, the use of silicon detectors will reduce the material in this region, and the 50 nsec signal collection time of MSGC detectors necessitates a different electronics optimisation.

By using larger substrates, and fewer MSGC planes per wheel in a modified design, the price advantage of MSGC detectors can be retained, since the price difference is dominated by the 'per channel' electronics cost. Any such change must be judged on the basis of performance.

Changes to the post-Annecy layout by the MSGC community following the Marseille Inner Detector workshop have not been discussed in this document. That base-line layout continues to evolve.
