###### Abstract

An inexpensive sonar instrument was prepared for measurements of sound velocity in two fluorocarbon vapors; per-fluoro-n-propane (C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\)), per-fluoro-n-butane (C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\)), and their custom mixtures. The apparatus, measurement principle and instrument software are described.

All sound velocity measurements in per-fluorocarbons were made in the low pressure range between 0.01 and 0.4 MPa, and at temperatures between 253 and 303 K. The purity of the C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) and C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) samples was checked using gas chromatography. Uncertainties in the speed of sound measurements were better than \(\pm\) 0.1 %. Comparisons were made with theoretical predictions of sound velocity for the two individual components. The instrument was then used for concentration monitoring of custom C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\)/C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) mixtures. This approach is based on the sensitivity of sound velocity to variations in the composition of binary mixtures of gases with disparate molecular weight. Verification of mixtures was made along the saturation line over a range of temperatures, and also over the P-T region where both components were superheated.

The instrument was calibrated with sound velocity measurements in Xenon; a gas having the combination of a well-defined specific heat ratio and high molar mass. The temperature sensitivity of the instrument for the required mixture measurement precision of 1% was determined to be 0.9 \({}^{\circ}\)C; the measured temperature stability of the instrument was of this order.

## 1 Introduction

As part of the development of evaporative fluorocarbon cooling for the silicon pixel and micro-strip tracking detectors [1, 2] of the ATLAS experiment at the future CERN Large Hadron Collider, we have studied perfluoro-n-propane (C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\))\({}^{2}\), perfluoro-n-butane (C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\))\({}^{3}\)

and custom C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\)/C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) mixtures. These fluids are suited to our cooling application due to their high dielectric constant, non-flammability and high expected radiation resistance [3].

Latent heat data for the refrigerants of interest are shown in Table 1, together with their molecular weights, saturated vapor pressures and the volume (cm\({}^{3}\)) of vapor produced per cm\({}^{3}\) liquid evaporated at -15\({}^{\circ}\)C. A target evaporation pressure close to 1 bar\({}_{\rm abs}\) at -15\({}^{\circ}\)C is attractive in our application, and this has motivated the study of custom C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\)/C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) mixtures.

We have used the NIST REFPROP [4] database with added provisional data files for the C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) and C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) components. The package was used to predict thermo-physical properties, including sound velocity, for the components and their binary mixtures, according to a modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation of state. The sonar was then used to verify the predictions of sound velocity and saturation pressure.

## 2 The sonar gas analyzer

In a binary mixture of gases, the sound velocity depends on the velocities in the individual components and their relative concentrations. Various formalisms have been developed to describe this variation, based [5] on Van der Waals and Benedict-Webb-Rubin equations of state, and [6] on a simplified formula for the case where the two gases differ widely in molecular weight. In this work we compare our measurements with the velocity predictions for C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\)/C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) mixtures from the extended NIST REFPROP database [4], which uses a modified Benedict-Webb-Rubin equation of state.

2.1 Present Apparatus

The sonar gas analyzer, based on an earlier development [5], is shown in Fig. 1. An aluminum tube contains a pair of ultrasonic transducers4 having a peak response at 45kHz, and separated by of (944.5 \(\pm\) 1.0) mm. The tube is surrounded by a coiled copper pipe through which C\({}_{6}\)F\({}_{14}\) coolant5 was circulated over a temperature range from -20\({}^{\circ}\) to 30\({}^{\circ}\)C. The temperature of the vapor within the tube was sampled to a precision \(\pm\) 0.1\({}^{\circ}\)C by of pair of calibrated PT100 sensors. Pressure was monitored to \(\pm\) 1 torr by an electronic pressure gauge6.

gated and interrogated by signals from a multifunction I/O board (MFB)7 in a PC. Gated packets of eight 45 kHz sound cycles are transmitted through the vapor in the tube. Synchronous with the leading edge of the first cycle (**A**), a fast (4 MHz) transit time clock is started.

Footnote 7: National Instruments MOI-16-L9 multifunction I/O card.

This clock is stopped when an above-threshold sound signal is received (**B**), and the number of counted 4MHz pulses is used with the path length to calculate the sound velocity.

The instrument is controlled by a LabView program, which performs a cyclic series of operations:

* An output channel of the MFB is enabled (**A**) for a programmable time interval (usually the duration of eight 45 kHz pulses: 0.176 ms). This pulse gates a free-running 45 kHz oscillator, to pass a packet of eight 45 kHz pulses through to the emitting transducer
* An input counter is started (**A**) on a second channel of the MFB

Figure 2: Photograph of the sonar gas analyzer and instrument timing sequence.

* The program then enters a loop, polling the number of 4MHz pulses counted on the second channel. When this number does not change between iterations, the program assumes the receiving transducer has seen the sound packet and has stopped the 4MHz clock (**B**). The loop then terminates. It may also terminate if the number of pulses exceeds 65535, indicating the receiver has not seen the packet in a reasonable time. (This may occur if the gas is highly absorptive, of if the transmitter or receiver biases are insufficient)
* The sound velocity calculated from the number of counted 4MHz pulses is compared with the velocity curve as a function of C4F10 in C3F8 predicted by the extended REFPROP database [4] at the measurement temperature. The user screen displays a real time cursor that projects the current mixture composition corresponding to the measured sound velocity. An example is shown in Fig.3 for a composition of 68.03% C4F10 in C3F8 at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C and 0.1 MPa.

A maximum sampling speed of 10Hz is possible in the instrument, and simple statistical routines allow the average and standard deviation of the speed of sound to be determined over a series of measurements.

### Calibration and Precision

The sonar analyzer was tested and calibrated with a range of gases, including nitrogen, helium and xenon, before being used with the refrigerants. The theoretical value of sound velocity, \(v_{t}\), for an ideal gas is given by:

\[v_{t}=\sqrt{\frac{\kappa\ R\ T}{m}}\ \ \ \, \tag{1}\]

where \(\kappa\) is the ratio of specific heats, \(R\) is the universal gas constant, \(T\) the absolute temperature and \(m\) the molar mass.

In nitrogen {helium} at 21.0 \({}^{\rm o}\)C, the measured velocities were 349.7 {996.1} ms\({}^{-1}\): around 0.3% {0.2% } lower than the ideal gas predictions of 350.6 {998.0} ms\({}^{-1}\).

In mixture analysis, it is necessary to examine the level to which temperature fluctuations can mask changes in mixture composition. The variation of sound velocity with absolute temperature is given by

\[v_{1}{}^{2/}v_{2}{}^{2}=\rm T_{1}{}^{\prime}\ T_{2}. \tag{2}\]

At a nominal temperature T\({}_{1}\) (K), the temperature change \(\delta\)T (T\({}_{2}\)- T\({}_{1}\)) that can cause a velocity change \(\delta v\) (\(v_{2}\)- \(v_{1}\)) is given by:

## 3 Experimental results

The first tests were made with C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\). A provisional data file was added to the NIST REFPROP package [4] for this fluid. Our measurements for the superheated region are shown in Table 3 and are on average \(\sim\) -0.2% lower than the NIST predictions at temperatures above 0\({}^{\circ}\)C, and lower by \(\sim\) -1.2% for predictions below -10\({}^{\circ}\)C.

More detailed measurements were performed at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C with different samples of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\); one of which was slightly polluted (\(\sim\)2%) by light impurities (mainly nitrogen).

Figure 4: Different series of measurement in C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\). Series1 with slight impurities, Series 3 and 5 with standard purity compared with “fresh” sample of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) and REFPROP predictionMeasurements are compared with REFPROP predictions in Fig. 4. The significant shift in velocity due to the impurities is evident.

The next fluid under study was C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\). Our measurements for the superheated region are shown in Table 4.

Measured velocities of sound are on average \(\sim\) 0.14% higher than the NIST predictions at temperatures above 0\({}^{\circ}\)C, and lower by \(\sim\) -0.78% for predictions below -10 C.

Following these studies with the component gases, three different custom mixtures of C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) and C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) were prepared via partial pressure mixing. The composition of these mixtures was checked using gas chromatography. Figure 5 is a sample chromatogram for a mixture with a target composition of 70%C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\)/30%C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\).

There is slight evidence for light impurities despite the sample having been prepared from the liquid phases of the two components. In Table 5, we present measurements for a custom mixture with target composition 20%C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) /80%C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\). The composition of the mixture was checked by gas chromatography and found to be 17%C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\)/83%C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\).

The measurement data were quite close to the NIST REFPROP sound velocity predictions. For example, at 0.1 MPa and 20 C, the measured velocity is within 0.2% of

Figure 4: Typical results from gas chromatography analysis

the REFPROP curve of predicted velocity. This curve is shown over the full mixture range in the real time display of Fig.3.

### Measurement of saturation pressure

The precise pressure sensor enabled us to demonstrate the use of sound velocity to fit the saturation line of single fluids, or of the lower boiling component in the binary mixture. The procedure is demonstrated in fig. 6 for a 60%C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\)/40%C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) mixture at -18 C. The sound velocity falls as the pressure is increased to \(\sim\) 0.05 the C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) condenses, leaving a mixture progressively enriched in C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\). The pressure of the saturation cusp at this temperature is in good agreement with the REFPROP prediction.

## 4 Conclusions

A simple sonar gas analyzer has been constructed and verified using velocity of sound measurements made in light gases and xenon. Comparisons with ideal gas predictions

were satisfactory, and the instrument has been used for purity checking and mixture composition determination in C\({}_{4}\)F\({}_{10}\) and C\({}_{3}\)F\({}_{8}\) per-fluorocarbon refrigerants and their mixtures in the pressure region (0.01 - 0.4 MPa) at temperatures ranging from -20 \({}^{\circ}\)C to +30 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Informative comparisons with REFPROP values have been done with satisfactory agreement. The instrument has also been used to determine the saturation line point for single fluids and for mixtures. The present temperature uncertainty of \(\sim\) 1 C in the instrument will be improved to allow more precise absolute superheated mixture determinations.
