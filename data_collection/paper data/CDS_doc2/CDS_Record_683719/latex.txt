###### Abstract

This paper is mainly based on a compilation of existing experimental data and on the experience gained by the TRT collaboration over more than 8 years, concerning ageing phenomena in proportional gas chambers and radiation hardness of materials commonly used for the construction of gaseous detectors. Aspects of the impact of the choice of construction materials on the TRT straw behaviour in an environment with high radiation levels are discussed. Explicit recommendations concerning the design of the detector mechanics and of the active gas system are given wherever possible at the end of each Section.

## 1 Introduction

The extremely harsh operating conditions expected at the LHC require a very careful choice of materials for all detector elements. The ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) is based on straw proportional chambers as individual detecting elements, and it is well known that the operation of such detectors in a high-radiation environment can be severely limited by ageing effects. These ageing effects may result in a gradual loss of gas gain, in a reduction of the operating plateau, in a loss of energy resolution, in excessive currents, in self-sustained current discharges, in sparking etc. They can all be caused by coating (or other possible degradations) of the cathode and/or anode wire surfaces.

Such ageing effects are well known, but it would be too optimistic to state that they are well studied phenomena, because there are many discrepancies in existing published data concerning the same gas mixtures. These most likely arise from the very specific conditions used for each experiment, which are very difficult to extrapolate to other circumstances. The ageing processes depend not only on the active gas composition but also, as it has been shown, on the presence or not of even very minute traces of contaminants, either initially present in the gas mixture, or appearing at a later stage as a result of outgassing from materials used in the assembly of the detector or of gas-system components. Those which are in contact with the gas may produce a dramatic effect on the life-time of gaseous detectors.

A large effort has been undertaken to bring some order into the wealth of existing experience and to find a possible explanation for the experimental data (see for instance [8-1], [8-2], [8-3], [8-4]). Recent extensive studies performed for micro-strip gas chambers (MSGCs) and a systematic analysis of the existing data [8-5], [8-6], [8-7] provide a way to formulate, if not quantitative, at least qualitative recommendations for the design of proportional chambers operating in high radiation fluxes. These publications (plus some others quoted below) and our experience gained within the TRT collaboration (published in [8-8], [8-9], [8-10], [8-11], [8-12], [8-13] and unpublished yet as well) provide a quite solid platform for discussion in the following Sections.

These discussions can be divided into three major parts, linked to each other but still clearly seen as separate: the choice of active gas, the choice of the detector materials, and the choice of the components of the active gas system.

## 2 Choice of the active gas

The specific characteristics of the TRT operation at the LHC impose strong restrictions on the choice of the straw gas:

* the gas must be a xenon-based mixture, with the maximum Xe-concentration compatible with safe and reliable operation at the LHC, thereby providing efficient X-ray absorption;
* the gas must also be as fast as possible, thereby minimising pile-up in time, which consists of signals deposited from particles produced in interactions occurring before or after the bunch crossing of interest. The gas mixture must therefore contain as large as possible a concentration of a fast molecular gas;
* the gas must also guarantee stable operation of the straws over a sufficient high-voltage range, for a large integrated charge per centimetre of wire (up to 7 C/cm) and for very high fluxes of particles crossing the straws (typically 200 kHz/cm).

It is well known that hydrocarbon additives (such as CH\({}_{4}\), C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\), iC\({}_{4}\)H\({}_{10}\) etc) are the best quenchers for proportional chambers, but, on one hand, they are not the fastest gases, nor, on the other hand, are they resistant to ageing processes, which is probably the most important aspect for stable operation at the LHC. In fact, it is very difficult to neutralise polymerisation processes involving ions and free radicals from disrupted hydrocarbon molecules (see for example [8-4]). That was the reason why, from the very beginning (RD6 proposal in 1989), non-organic components were chosen for the active gas mixture. The most promising of those most often used turned out to be CO2 and CF4.

**CO2**

CO2 is a very promising candidate for the quenching gas in an active gas mixture. It is very robust to polymerisation processes and is also one of the fastest gases. Moreover, oxygen-containing groups, such as -CO- and -O-, help to stop polymerisation processes of any hydrocarbon contaminants possibly present in the active gas. It has also been found that CO2 has some etching properties. For example, after operating over a certain period a proportional chamber filled with an Ar/CH4 mixture, the cathode wires were found to be covered with rapidly-grown filaments (whiskers), but when Ar/CO2 was substituted as the active gas mixture, these whiskers were etched away, presumably by the chemical action of oxygen released by CO2 in plasma discharges [8-3].

First ageing studies with straws for operation at the LHC were actually performed with a Xe/CO2 mixture, and showed no traces of any deposits on the anode wire up to integrated charges of 5 C/cm [8-8]. Unfortunately, a simple Xe/CO2 mixture cannot be used for the TRT straw detector at the LHC, because it has a very high yield of photons in the avalanche, which renders the mixture very unstable. There are two additional serious arguments why this binary mixture cannot be used:

* the first one is that, for the required Xe-concentration of 70%, the electron drift velocity remains too low for operation at the LHC at high luminosity;
* the second one is that, in a large system, there are many sources of impurities, which can cause ageing. Some of these impurities may contain Si, which has been shown to often generate very strong ageing effects. The valence shell of Si is the same as that for carbon, and one therefore expects similar chemical properties in both cases. Si can polymerise with both hydrocarbons and oxygen to form polysilicone (-[Si(CH3)2-O]n-) and silicate (SiO2). Many products of hydrocarbon and oxygen radicals are volatile and can be removed by the gas flow itself. This is not so much the case with Si-based radicals, because they are much heavier, which poses a much more serious problem in the case of Si contamination. In the presence of hydrocarbons, the most probable anode wire deposits will consist of polysilicone, whereas, in the case of a Xe/CO2 mixture, the anode wire deposits will most likely consist of SiO2, which is a perfect insulator (glass). In fact, nearly all measurements, which have used analytic techniques to examine aged anode wires, have found Si in some form (see, for instance, [8-14], [8-15], [8-15], [8-16], [8-17], [8-18]). Sources of Si contamination will be discussed in the next Sections.

In [8-1] it was pointed out that gas mixtures containing CF4 could be used to remove Si-based products, e.g. by creating volatile SiF4, in a way similar to the way oxygen may remove hydrocarbon-based deposits.

### \(\mathrm{CF_{4}}\)

As mentioned above, even in the absence of organic components in the active gas mixture, traces of Si in the gas can lead to a very solid (sometimes even glass-like) deposit on the anode wire. Gas mixtures based on \(\mathrm{CF_{4}}\) are widely used in the semiconductor industry to etch silicon and silicon-oxide substrates. The addition of \(\mathrm{CF_{4}}\) is expected to provoke etching phenomena, arising from chemical attack by the radicals and negative ions produced during ionisation of the active gas in the detector, which may then compete with polymerisation processes, slowing down or eliminating ageing effects. The chemical processes involved in plasma etching are extremely complex. There are a large number of possible reactions between ions, electrons, free radicals, excited and stable molecules, which can occur in either the gas itself or at the gas/solid interfaces. In addition, many of these chemical reactions may be extremely sensitive to parameters such as flow rate, pressure, temperature, power density, concentration of reactants and minor impurities. The most probable reactions responsible for Si-based material etching are disassociation reactions happening in electron interactions with the \(\mathrm{CF_{4}}\) molecules:

\(\mathrm{CF_{4}}+\mathrm{e}\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{(CF_{3}}^{*}+\mathrm{F}^{*}+\mathrm{e}\)\(\Rightarrow\)\(\mathrm{CF_{2}}^{**}+2\mathrm{F}^{*}+\mathrm{e})\) or \(\mathrm{(CF_{3}}^{*}+\mathrm{F})\) or \(\mathrm{(CF_{3}}^{*}+\mathrm{F}^{*})\).

The \(\mathrm{F}^{*}\) radical is primarily responsible for Si etching, while \(\mathrm{CF_{x}}^{*}\) radicals preferentially etch \(\mathrm{SiO_{2}}\) (see for example the discussion in [8-19]). In fact, all of these radicals were found at some level of concentration using a mass spectrometer connected to the output gas of straws under radiation and operating with the TRT baseline gas mixture (\(\mathrm{Xe/CF_{4}/CO_{2}}\)) [8-11]. Certainly, only charged molecules appearing in the ionisation process inside the mass spectrometer itself can be analysed, but the M/Z spectra of the gas samples in the mass spectrometer and of the gas ionised in the avalanche should be exactly the same. From this one can expect that the same radicals are present in the straw volume.

Actually, in plasma techniques, \(\mathrm{CF_{4}}\)-based gases are used for both etching and deposition processes, the distinction being made by the gas with which the \(\mathrm{CF_{4}}\) is mixed. In general, the addition of oxygenated species shifts the chemistry of the plasma towards etching, while the addition of hydrogenated species shifts the chemistry of the plasma towards polymerisation [8-4]. But the reality is much more complex and, in some cases, this statement appears to be incorrect. For instance, the addition of 10% \(\mathrm{O_{2}}\) to an \(\mathrm{Ar/CF_{4}}\) mixture has turned out to have dramatic consequences in some cases [8-4], despite the fact that this mixture was expected to be strongly etching and therefore unlikely to favour depositions on the anode wire. In contrast, a \(\mathrm{CF_{4}/iC_{4}H_{10}}\) (80:20) mixture was found to be extremely resistant to ageing, and was even used as an active mixture to recover aged chambers. For instance, full recovery was observed with this mixture for a chamber prematurely aged by bubbling the \(\mathrm{Ar/C_{2}H_{6}}\) mixture through silicone oil [8-19]. Anode wire deposits have, however, been observed for lower \(\mathrm{CF_{4}}\) concentrations, for example in the above mixture with the reverse concentration (20:80). For higher \(\mathrm{CF_{4}}\) concentrations (e.g. 95%) in the same mixture, heavy carbonaceous deposits were observed on theanode wire. It was even a surprise to discover that pure CF4 and CF4-rich gases appear to age quite rapidly [8-4].

From what has been discussed above, the major conclusion is that CF4 is a very promising component for the TRT gas mixture, with a high potential to stop most ageing processes, but also that detailed studies are necessary to make sure that it operates in the expected way in the exact chosen gas mixture.

The other argument to use CF4 for the TRT is that, among the various possible mixtures which could satisfy the requirements mentioned at the very beginning of this Section, the fastest one was found to be Xe/CF4.

However, as in the case of Xe/CO2 mixtures, these mixtures are rather prone to discharges and therefore do not guarantee stable operation over long periods of time. As a consequence, a ternary mixture, Xe/CF4/CO2, was finally chosen for the TRT active gas, and further detailed measurements showed that it provides very stable operation without sparking up to very high gas gains. The studies leading to the choice of the optimal gas mixture also showed that the maximal Xe-concentration should be around 70%, since higher Xe-concentrations lead to unstable operation of the straws. Lower concentrations would obviously degrade the transition radiation performance. The minimal amount of CO2 needed to confine discharges to the self-limited streamer mode was found to be 6%. The TRT straw active gas mixture was finally chosen to be **70% Xe + 20% CF4 + 10% CO2**, a reasonable compromise between many mutually exclusive requirements. Ageing effects in this mixture were studied and published in [8-8], [8-9], [8-10], [8-11], [8-12], [8-13]. No effects of any significance were found up to doses of 8 C/cm. Detailed examination of anode wires and straw walls (cathode) after irradiation have shown clear evidence for etching processes on both surfaces. From this, one can conclude that the chosen mixture has the expected properties and meets the basic requirements, but one must also admit at this stage that all ageing measurements have been performed with small prototypes, where all possible sources of contamination of the active gas were under control. Finally, recent studies have concentrated on etching of the gold surface of the anode wire itself (see also Section 4.1).

It should be stressed that chemical processes involved in plasma reactions are extremely complex and can be highly sensitive to numerous parameters, including the concentration of possible reactants and minor impurities [8-3], [8-4], [8-19]. Clearly, the presence of large amounts of CF4 in a mixture does not necessarily ensure good ageing characteristics. This means that all possible precautions have to be taken in the design of the detector and of its active gas system to minimise the number of sources of possible impurities. How to achieve this is discussed in the next Sections.

## 3 General recommendations for the choice of materials

As has been repeatedly mentioned above, the materials used in the construction of the detector itself and of its active gas system are among the most critical items that may affect the lifetime of gaseous detectors. This is because many non-metallic materials outgas and therefore produce vapours, which, transported within the active gas flow, may subsequently be deposited directly on the surface of electrodes and insulators in the chamber and/or favour the polymerisation of radicals in the avalanche plasma, leading to the growth of deposits in the vicinity of the irradiated regions. In both cases, the lifetime of the detectors can be seriously shortened.

For obvious reasons, the use of glues, plastics and other organic materials is unavoidable in most particle detectors. One should emphasise that, for tracking detectors at the LHC in general and for the TRT in particular, most of these materials will be placed in an extremely hostile radiation environment, and the material choices must therefore be made on the basis of their radiation robustness. For ageing processes, one of the most important parameters which specify the radiation hardness of the material is the amount of gas which the material desorbs after irradiation. This effect is characterised by the so-called G-value, i.e. the number of free molecules per 100 eV of absorbed radiation. This number may be as large as 64 as in the case of isotactic polypropylene [8-20]. Usually, for organic materials, the main component of outgassing under irradiation is H\({}_{2}\), but there is also a substantial amount of heavy molecules. The G-values for different materials are given in Table 3-1 (see also [8-20]). There are a number of chemical groups which, when incorporated into the polymer chain, are resistant to radiation. Aromatic groups such as the phenyl group in polystyrene have lower G-values (from \(\sim\) 1 to \(\sim\) 0.03). Aromatic groups in polymers absorb the excitation energy, but their excited states undergo efficient decay to the ground state with a low yield for binding cleavage (and hence for radical formation). Other examples of radiation-resistant aromatic polymers are polyimides and polyetherimides, as can clearly be seen from Table 3-1.

**One of the major guidelines for the choice of materials for the construction of the TRT detector is therefore to use materials containing aromatic groups wherever possible.**

Finally, it is mandatory to test each selected material for its impact on ageing processes in the detector gas, before and after irradiation by ionising particles and neutrons. A very large amount of important work has been done to perform such tests, to summarise the existing experience throughout the world, and to make recommendations for the materials to be used for the construction of the detector and of its active gas system [8-1], [8-2], [8-3], [8-4], [8-5], [8-6], [8-7]. These publications and the experience of the TRT collaboration itself are the basis for the discussions and conclusions presented below.

The other step in the selection of a material is to perform an analysis of its chemical composition. The most dangerous chemical elements are Si, S and halogens (mainly Cl in the case of the TRT). Hydrocarbon compounds emanating from different plastic parts due to normal outgassing or to irradiation may also turn out to be quite dangerous.

**Si**

Silicon is a quite widely used material, e.g. in G10 frames, silicone rubber seals (RVT), silicone oil bubblers and molecular sieves. The effect of the presence of Si on chamber ageing has been discussed above. Although the CF\({}_{4}\) component in the TRT active gas mixture provides protection from Si-based deposits in the straws, everything has to be done to reduce the amount of soft Si-containing materials in contact with the active gas. It is hard to blame such materials as glass (or molecular sieves) in wire-chamber ageing, but what is known for sure is that soft-material lubricants containing Si produce such effects.

**Phthalates**

Using mass spectrometry, it has been possible to show the presence of phthalates in at least one instance [8-21] on the anode and to a lesser degree on the cathode, in the case of an aged drift chamber. Phthalates are a class of compounds formed from

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c} \hline
**Material** & **G-value** \\ \hline Low-density polyethylene & 3.86 \\ High-density polyethylene & 3.06 \\ Polystyrene & 0.026 \\ Plasticised PVC & 1.16 \\ Unplasticised PVC & 0.77 \\ Poly-methyl-methacrylate & 1.18 \\ Poly-tetrafluor-ethylene & 0.098 \\ Nylon 6 & 1.02 \\ Polycarbonate & 0.86 \\ Polyethylene terephthalate & 0.17 \\ Polysulfon (depends on chemical structure) & 0.13-10 \\ Epoxy resins & 0.12-0.57 \\ Polyimide (KAPTON) & 0.00276 \\ Polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) & \(\sim\)0.005 \\ Polyetherimide (PEI, ULTEM) & 0.014 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Gas yields (G-values) from plastics irradiated at 20 \({}^{\ 0}\)C in air.

phthalic acid and short-chain alcohols. They have quite large molecular masses (up to 279 [8-21]) and very easily create deposits on anode wires. Phthalates are quite stable and are not destroyed by the intensity of chemical reactions in the avalanche plasma, nor by chemistry on the wire surfaces, at least for the Ar/methane mixture used for the measurements described in [8-21]. Several phthalates are widely used as additives to commercial plastics, especially to polyvinylchloride (PVC) and its derivatives, but not limited to these. Such additives function as "plasticisers" transforming a glassy plastic (for instance PVC) into softer and more pliable material. Two of the phthalates most commonly found in plastics are dibutyl-phthalate and dioctyl-phthalate.

### Sulphur

The presence of sulphur can have lead to damaging effects even at the level of a few ppm [8-22]. Sulphur has often been found on anodes (see [8-2], [8-4], [8-15], [8-16] and other references in [8-1]). As in the case of Si, the origin of the sulphur found in the system is not always very clear. Sulphur contamination may exist in the supply of the active gas and/or in other materials in contact with the gas. It was found in certain cases that the source of the sulphur observed in deposits are mould-release agents, which contain sulphur and are used in the fabrication of many plastic components (see [8-1] and [8-33]).

### Halogens (Cl)

Similarly to sulphur, halogens can be present in the active gas supply or can be introduced through outgassing of residues, arising e.g. from cleaning with quite commonly used chlorinated solvents, such as trichlorethylene, trichlorotrifluoroethane and others. The presence of chlorine in the avalanche plasma can accelerate polymerisation processes enormously. In particular, chlorine radicals are very active. They can even act as gas-phase catalysts, enhancing the concentration of free radicals by the extraction of hydrogen from hydrocarbon species. As an example, the presence of only about 10 ppm of Freon 11 (FCCl3) in an active gas mixture [8-2] gave a dramatic change in the polymerisation process rate (by more than a factor of 50). On the other hand, no ageing in a gas mixture containing a large amount of Freon 11 was observed for small irradiation doses [8-4].

Atomic chlorine acts as a hydrogen extractor, creating acid HCl molecules and hydrocarbon radicals which can subsequently polymerise. Atomic chlorine is not depleted, since it reappears in the reaction e' + HCl -> H + Cl +e'. Furthermore, chlorine is very electronegative and the Cl' ion can be readily drawn to the anode wire, where polymerisation at the surface may occur.

In principle, some F-containing hydrocarbons can be easily disassociated, thus forming CF2, a radical which is very capable of initiating polymerisation. One should mention that this radical does not appear in the avalanche near the wire, at least not in large enough quantities to initiate polymerisation in the TRT active gas mixture which contains 20% CF4.

### Chemical reactions in the presence of CF4

Unfortunately, the presence of CF4 in the active gas mixture has not only positive effects but also creates some problems. CF4 is one of the most inert fluorides but, nevertheless, even pure CF4 reacts violently with Al [8-23]. In the same way as for Al, some plastic materials can significantly suffer in contact with CF4 (Teflon, Viton, PT-FE) [8-24]. Clearly, preference should be given to materials which are known to be very robust with respect to CF4. Chemical reactions of CF4 and its derivatives with water will produce a very strong acid, FH. All precautions should therefore be taken to avoid traces of water in the system.

As mentioned above, in the presence of electrical discharges in the straws, the CF4 (and CO2) gas disassociates, forming active radicals (CF2, CF3, F). These radicals immediately react with the surrounding gas (even with Xe). Very strong oxidising agents might be created in reactions with CO2 and its disassociation products, such as CF4O, CFO2, OF2. O2F2, CO2, CF3, F2, O2 and many others. Such products and radicals will react with the detector materials (even with the gold on the anode wire) [8-25], [8-26] and [8-27]. This problem should be kept in mind constantly when choosing the final detector materials.

The problem of the stability of the different materials in such an environment will be discussed in each of the subsequent Sections, but one should stress that the final validation of the chosen materials has to be performed in very realistic conditions, where many radiolysis products may come out of the detector and could be accumulated in the active gas volume.

## 4 Choice of detector materials

### Anode wire

Dedicated studies of the impact of the anode wire material on ageing effects have been performed in [8-4]. Different wires (Au/W, W, Cu, Al, Ni) were exposed to irradiation in CF4 mixtures. Depositions on the anode wire were shown to occur more often for non-gold-plated materials. The non-gold-plated wires mentioned above react to form metal fluorides on the surface when irradiated in gas mixtures containing CF4. Some of these are volatile (e.g. WF6), some create a solid film (Cu, Ni) which probably crumbles for large doses [8-4], [8-25], [8-26].

The general recommendation of all the authors who have studied this effect ([8-2], [8-3] etc.) is **to use Au/W wire, particularly for the gas mixtures containing CO2 and CF4. This was accepted for the TRT as a baseline.** Even gold reacts however with CF4 and CO2 radicals [8-27], and some indications of gold etching were foundusing the TRT gas mixture itself. The gold-coating technology is an essential parameter in the obtention of stable long-term operation in the etching environment expected in the TRT straws. In order to make a final choice for the wire, many samples from different companies produced using different technologies were submitted to stringent irradiation tests. These tests are still in progress at the present moment.

### 4.2 Straws

As stated above, the radiation hardness of the various materials is one of their most important characteristics. In particular, any straw should be able to operate up to an integral dose of 10 MRad without any indication of change of its properties. Materials must also be very pure and stable to minimise their impact on straw chamber ageing. A multi-layer Kapton film has been chosen as the base material for the straws [8-9], [8-10]. Kapton (or polyimide) is one of the most radiation-resistant plastic materials [8-20], [8-28], [8-28], [8-29] and has a very low G-value of 0.00276, as shown in Table 3-1. In order to provide maximum electrical conductivity, the base Kapton film is covered by an Al-layer of 0.2-0.3 \(\upmu\)m thickness. As described in Section 2, the chosen TRT operating gas mixture has quite strong etching properties, thus providing as much robustness as possible against ageing phenomena. As a protection for the otherwise easily etched Al-layer, a cover of about 5 \(\upmu\)m of carbon-doped polyimide is added on top of the Al-layer through a process specifically developed for the production of the straw coated film [8-9]. The final surface resistance of the conductive layer is 1-2 Ohm/square.

This coated layer was demonstrated to be very robust to etching processes up to doses of at least 18 C/cm [8-9], [8-13]. Such a cathode design is probably the only one which can tolerate stable long-term operation with the chosen TRT gas mixture at high irradiation doses. As an example, straws with a Cu-cathode have shown significant degradation under certain conditions with a CF\({}_{4}\)-containing mixture even without irradiation [8-30]. This happened because O\({}_{2}\) diffused through the straw wall and gave rise to chemical reactions with the CF\({}_{4}\) gas in the regions of high electric field, thereby creating F\({}_{2}\) which actively reacts with Cu.

The opposite side of the TRT straw coated film is covered by a 5 \(\upmu\)m thick polyurethane-based thermo-welding layer. This material has been also specifically developed to provide maximum radiation hardness. Polyurethane is not as radiation-resistant as polyimide, polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) or polyetherimide (PEI) materials, but is quite close to them. It has been demonstrated that the straw itself can easily tolerate a radiation dose corresponding to 100 years of LHC operation [8-31]. There is evidence that soft polyurethane adhesives sometimes give rise to ageing effects [8-3], but, in the case of the TRT straws, no difference has been found in terms of straw ageing between straws prepared with a polyimide or a polyurethane thermo-welding layer. It should also be mentioned that the contact surface between the polyurethane layer and the active gas is quite small, about 1 cm\({}^{2}\) for a straw of 50 cm length, i.e. with a total surface of 60 cm\({}^{2}\).

If the input active gas is pure enough, no ageing effects have been observed in many straws irradiated up to accumulated doses of 8 C/cm [8-8], [8-9], [8-10], [8-11], [8-31].

The major remaining task is therefore to provide the straws with a pure input gas, which has to be kept in this condition over a long period of time (typically one year). At this point, it is important to stress one critical aspect of the TRT operation: since xenon is a very expensive gas, a completely closed-loop gas system is foreseen to be used for the TRT operation at the LHC [8-31]. This means that all impurities which may appear in the gas will remain present until they are removed by the purification system or are deposited elsewhere.

### Plastic parts

Each straw is terminated by end-pieces to provide the necessary wire and straw location and fixation as well as the electrical contacts. Among the various plastic materials which could be used for the straw end-pieces, only a few have been really considered: PEEK, ULTEM or PEI, Delrin, polysulphur and polycarbonate.

**Polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK)**

The chemical formula of polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) is:

This material consists mainly of aromatic groups and, hence, turns out to be a very radiation-resistant plastic [8-20], [8-28], [8-29]. There are no indications of ageing effects in gaseous detectors equipped using this polymer [8-5], [8-6], [8-7]. The only known disadvantages against using this plastic material are its low adhesive ability and its cost.

**Polyetherimide (ULTEM, PEI)**

The chemical formula of polyetherimide is:

Due to its large content in aromatic groups, it has almost the same radiation hardness as polyimide and PEEK materials. It also has very good adhesion properties and does not contain dangerous elements (see Section 3). Some studies performed with this material [8-7] have shown no ageing effects. The CH\({}_{3}\) radicals could be a potential source of organic impurities during irradiation, but, thanks to its large content in aromatic groups, this has not turned out to be the case, and the G-value for this plastic material is very low (\(\sim\) 0.014). This is possibly the best candidate for the straw end-pieces, but more studies of ageing effects in the presence of this material after irradiation nevertheless remain to be completed before the final choice is made.

**Polyoximethylene (Delrin, POM)**

Delrin or polyoximethylene (POM) has often been used in wire chambers for feed-through elements. Normally, this material does not give rise to any ageing effects in chambers, but, in [8-32], there was a suspicion that it can be the reason for anode deposits for a dose of 0.015 C/cm. This material is not so good for gluing since it has poor adhesion properties. Another serious disadvantage of this material is its poor resistance to radiation (its basic properties change significantly already after a dose of 1 MRad [8-20], [8-33]). It is therefore not recommended at all to use this material for the TRT where the dose levels can reach close to 10 MRad.

**Polycarbonate**

The chemical formula of polycarbonate is:

\[\begin{array}{c}\mbox{O}\\ \mbox{[-O-C-R-O-C-]}_{\mbox{n}}\end{array}\]

This material has very good adhesion properties and, as for Delrin, there have been no counter-indications against its use from ageing tests. But, normally, it does nothave better radiation hardness than polyethylene, and can therefore be safely used only for radiation doses below 1 MRad [8-29], [8-33], [8-32], [8-33]. Some modified variants of this material containing aromatic groups appear to have much higher radiation hardness, but this remains an issue for further specific studies, if needed.

**Polysulfon**

There are many materials which are labelled as polysulfons. Standard polysulfon materials do not contain aromatic groups and therefore have very low resistance to radiation (similar to polyethylene).

The chemical formula of aromatic-based polysulfons is:

Such materials have good adhesion properties and, in principle, adequate resistance to radiation, although this strongly depends on the exact chemical structure [8-20]. These materials do however contain a S-component, which makes them into a potential source of very dangerous impurities in the active gas. In fact, strong ageing effects have been observed with these materials [8-5]. Under irradiation, they may emanate such gases as SO2 and oleins [8-20] (the exact gas composition depends again on the exact chemical structure). Such materials are therefore not recommended for use in gaseous chambers [8-3].

**Vectra**

VECTRA has been shown to be an acceptable material for MSGC construction [8-7]. It has exhibited no ageing effects and is very radiation-hard. But this material is, in fact, a liquid crystal polymer with anisotropic mechanical properties, which makes it almost impossible to use for TRT applications (e.g. for the end-pieces).

**Final recommendations for the straw end-piece material**

The most important characteristics of the materials discussed above are shown in Table 4-2. The most promising candidate is **PEI (or ULTEM)**, but the validation studies still have to be completed:

* ageing effects after irradiation;
* stability in the presence of CF4-dissociation products;
* some plastic parts are placed inside the straws, in a region near the wire where the avalanche occurs. Dedicated ageing studies for this case should be performed.

**There are many indications that one of the sources of gas pollution observed in the past are the mould-release agents used in injection-moulding processes. Before use, all moulded pieces have to be carefully prepared and special cleaning procedures have to be foreseen.**

### Connection circuits

For the electrical contacts inside the active gas volume in the end-cap TRT, flexible Kapton printed circuits will be used. The copper contact elements are gold-plated, which protects them from chemical reactions with CO2 and CF4. Such a design should be very robust in terms of TRT operation at the LHC, but, to be sure of the long-term performance, these elements have to be tested under conditions which reproduce those planned for the actual detector and and in a closed-loop gas system.

### Printed circuit boards (barrel tension plates and end-cap webs)

A potentially dangerous but unavoidable material in the detector design is G10 because of its Si-content. The tension plate for the barrel TRT and the web circuits for the end-cap TRT are made from G10 material. There have been many observations leading to the suspicion that some ageing effects are associated with this material,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \hline
**Material** & **Radiation** & **Ageing** & **Adhesion** \\  & **hardness** & & **properties** \\ \hline PEEK (polyetherether-ketone) & Very good & OK & Not so good \\ ULTEM (polyether-imide) & Very good & OK & OK \\ Delrin (polyecetal or polyoxmethylene) & Not good & No remarks without & Not so good \\ Polycarbonate & Not good & No remarks without & OK \\  & & irradiation & \\ Polysulfon & Can be good & Bad & OK \\ Polysulfur & & & \\ Phenylene (Ryton & & & \\ R4), & & & \\ VECTRA C150 (liquid crystal polymer) & Good & OK & OK but has \\  & & & anisotropic \\  & & & mechanical \\  & & & properties \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

but, in the conclusions of recent reviews ([8-3] and [8-6]), it has been pointed out that the material itself is probably safe, but that it may in some cases have a **silicone mould-release agent** on its surface, leading to possible ageing effects. The observation that glass reinforced plastics such as Stesalit do not give rise to ageing effects proves that the problems with G10 are most probably associated with surface quality (see for example [8-5]). The recommendations for the TRT detector in this area are therefore to **minimise the surface area in contact with the active gas and to develop appropriate surface-cleaning procedures.**

### Glues

Epoxy resin is another unavoidable material for detector construction and the exact choice of resin may be very critical for the detector performance. In [8-3], it is stated that hard epoxies (such as Torr-Seal or "5-minute") do not produce pollution leading to chamber ageing. Unfortunately, this statement is not very detailed and additional studies have to be performed. Some information about epoxy resin composition and radiation hardness can be found in [8-20], [8-28], [8-28], [8-29] and [8-37], but the exact chemical composition of such resins is part of the "know-how" of the producer and is almost impossible to obtain.

The final epoxy resin product itself does not contain any specifically dangerous elements, since it consists of CH groups, oxygen and nitrogen. The most common epoxy resins are prepared by the reaction of bisphenol-A or of novolac with ejichlorohydrin. Thus, one of the reagents (epichlorohydrin) which is used in the production process contains Cl. Normally, this Cl-content is removed from the final product, but traces of it may nevertheless remain. As a rule, epoxy resins (but not all of them) contain aromatic groups and are radiation hard. Epoxy resins in their incurred state are converted to useful thermosets by reaction with a variety of hardeners. The most widely used hardeners are: diaminodiphenylsulfone (DDS), diethylentriamine, methyl-nadic-anhydride (MNA=NMA), triethylenetetraamine and a mixture of tetra- and hexahydrophthalic-anhydride. The first hardener mentioned above contains sulphur and should not be used for the TRT. In principle, some additives which accelerate the curing process may be used (dimethylbenzylamine, polyalcohol). The latter is preferred from the ageing point of view.

As has been mentioned above, almost all epoxy resins are quite radiation-hard and can easily tolerate a dose of more than 50 MRad (the maximum radiation dose expected for the TRT is below 10 MRad). Unfortunately, there is not much data available concerning the outgassing properties of epoxy resins before and after irradiation. In practice, it would be better to use the epoxies which are the most radiation-hard, not only because one expects them to lead to excellent long-term mechanical stability of the construction (which is defined mainly by the adhesion properties of the epoxy, which in turn depend only weakly on the radiation dose at least up to 300 MRad), but, also because one then does not expect a large amount of outgassing under irradiation. As with other polymers, aromatic resins give in practice a better radiation tolerance: this applies to both the resins and the curing agents. The most commonly used epoxies are listed below in decreasing order of their resistance to irradiation [8-20]:

* Triglicaldi p-amino phenol (TGPAP);
* Tetraglicaldil-diaminaphenil-methane (TGDDM);
* Epoxy Novolac (EN);
* Diglicaldi ether of Bisphenol A (DGEBA);
* Diglicaldil aniline (DGA).

Similar, for the curing agents:

* Diamino diphenil methane (DDM);
* Diamino diphenil sulfone (DDS), which is anyway recommended not to be used);
* Methyl-nadic-anhydride (MNA).

One should stress that, for the TRT detector, it is necessary in many cases to use epoxies cured at room temperature. The mechanical properties of 15 types of epoxy resins cured at room temperature have been studied in [8-34] up to 100-300 MRad. All the resins, except Araldite AY103/HY 951 and Sikadur 31/N, show no variation of shear strength up to doses of 300 MRad.

The impact of epoxy resin materials (19 samples) on chamber ageing has been studied in [8-6] and [8-7]. Most of these studies were performed with epoxy resins which have a quite high curing temperature (more than 50 \({}^{\rm o}\)C) and are far from complete, but they give a good starting point for the choice of candidate resins for TRT construction.

For the purposes of the TRT construction, glues can be separated into three classes.

### Construction glues

A major function of such glues is to provide the necessary mechanical rigidity and gas tightness of the construction joint. Such glues should therefore have a quite high viscosity and a large shear strength. Their pot life should be at least 1 hour and their curing time at room temperature should be about 24 hours.

A good candidate for such applications is Araldite 106 with one of the highest shear strengths, which does not change significantly after irradiation up to doses of 300 MRad (see [8-34]). This glue was nevertheless observed to give rise to large outgassing and ageing even without irradiation [8-7]. The glue surface, if exposed to the ambient air is not cured fully. After discussion with the producer, it was found that the reason for this is that the humidity has to be 0 for proper curing. It is probably necessary to repeat all the studies performed so far in the case of this particular glue.

Another candidate is Araldite 134 which has properties close to A106 but which, after curing under ambient conditions, presents a surface which is quite soft. This glue has not been studied at all, but one should mention that is is quite brittle.

Redux 420 is a good candidate construction glue because it has a very large shear strength and a good surface after curing. This glue should be studied properly.

### Sealing glues

Other glues used in detector construction mainly have a sealing function. Such glues are used for the gluing of end-pieces to the straws, of the straws into their support frames, etc. They do not require a large shear strength, but should have a low viscosity and give rise to minimal outgassing, since their contact area with the active gas is often quite large. Their pot life should be at least 30 minutes, and their curing time about 24 hours.

A good candidate glue for such applications is Stycast 1266, which was found to have very low outgassing and not to give rise to any ageing effects.

Another candidate glue is Rutapox L20, which is actually used for the TRT straw reinforcement (but is not in contact with the active gas). This glue is very fragile when cured at room temperature, but has very good properties if cured at 60\({}^{\rm o}\) C. It has not been studied in terms of ageing effects at all.

Since the above glues have certain disadvantages (small pot life for Stycast and fragility for Rutapox cured at room temperature), another good candidate glue which has been considered is Araldite 103 (with hardener 951), which has a reasonable pot life of more than 100 minutes and a mediumviscosity.

Very good properties have also been found in the case of Tra-Bond 2115, which is very resistant to mechanical shocks and to temperature cycling. It is also resistant to water, ozone, most petroleum products, mild acids and alkalis, as well as many other chemicals. It has a pot life of about 2 hours and a curing time of 24 hours.

These last two glues have not been studied either in terms of ageing effects up to now. It should be pointed out here that, if viscosity is not a major parameter, Araldite 103 could also be used as a construction glue, since its shear strength is quite large, about 10 MPa up to doses of 50 MRad.

### Conductive glues

Conductive glues are needed mainly for the barrel TRT to connect the high-voltage circuit to the straw cathode. The main requirements are a good electrical conductivity and no observable ageing effects. Tra-duct 2922 has been used for the TRT barrel prototypes and appears to be a good candidate, but no systematic ageing studies have been performed yet.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|p{42.7pt}|} \hline

In many applications it is very convenient to operate with instant glues, such as cyanolite or loctite. These glues are based on cyanoacrylate and should therefore be considered with care before use. During polymerisation, they may produce solid deposits on the neighbouring elements (straw wall, wire, etc.) and they are very sensitive to irradiation [8-8]. On top of this, these products are not recommended by their producers for use in strongly oxidising environments, which is in fact the case for the TRT active gas (see Section 3). Some practical experience with such glues (cyanolite) for the TRT assembly has also shown their poor compatibility with epoxy glues.

A summary of the properties of the possible candidate glues for the TRT detector construction is given in Table 4.3. It is clear that the final choices can only be made once further studies have been performed. No single glue has yet been convincingly tested for outgassing and ageing after irradiation.

**Ageing studies have to be performed using straws with the nominal active gas mixture in the presence of samples of the chosen candidate glues before and after irradiation**

### Carbon-fibre elements

Carbon-fibre composite materials are usually very radiation-hard. For the barrel TRT, only the module shells are produced from carbon-fibre composite materials, and none of these materials are in contact with the active gas: their outgassing and ageing properties are thus not relevant in this case. For the end-cap TRT, however, the support rings are produced from carbon-fibre composite materials and are in direct contact with the active gas. Moreover, the outer support rings contain one penetrating hole per straw with an increased contact surface with the active gas because of the natural microstructure of the composite itself (the space between carbon filaments is not wholly filled by resin and about 1% of the cross-sectional area is usually occupied by microchannels running along the fibres into the structure). Some care should therefore be taken when specifying this type of material.

If the resin and the curing agent for the carbon-fibre composite material are chosen correctly, the material has very good resistance to radiation. The arguments for selecting resins with optimal radiation resistance based on their molecular structure have been developed above: aromaticity is one of the factors of primary importance. As already stated several times, composite materials based on aromatic resins can be expected to exhibit low yields for radiolysis products, similarly to the pure resins themselves. For example, the G-value [8-20] of carbon-fibre reinforced plastics based on an epoxy resin of the type TGDDM cured with DDS (both containing aromatic structures) has been measured to be as low as 0.025. In principle, such remarks also apply to glass-fibre composites. It has been shown for instance that an epoxy composite based on TGDDM is significantly more radiation resistant than composites based on DGEBA. One should stress however once more that for the TRT detector construction it is recommended not to use DDS hardeners.

**Dedicated ageing studies before and after irradiation have to be performed for the final validation of the chosen carbon-fibre composite materials.**

### Solder

Solder itself is not a very benign material for gaseous detectors. Problems may arise from the acid flux used for soldering, which normally contains halogens. Definitely, the best solution is to avoid any soldering operations within the detector active gas volume. **If really necessary, special soldering procedures would have to be developed and ageing tests would have to be performed.** It should be mentioned here that most ageing measurements performed with TRT straws have been obtained using test straws for which the wire was soldered to a contact pin (using a standard CERN solder). The solder points were in contact with the active gas both at its input into the straw and at at its output from the straw. No ageing effects have been observed.

## 5 Choice of the components for the active gas system

The active gas system is a crucial component of the TRT design: even if the active gas mixture has been chosen properly and if the detector has been designed with utmost care, a contaminated input gas may completely destroy the detector performance. In the case of the TRT, for which a fully closed-loop gas system will be built (see [8-31] for a detailed description), this issue is obviously very important. The active gas system has also therefore to be designed with utmost care, not only to effectively purify the gas, but also to avoid any possibility of pollution of the active gas by impurities, which, in some cases, may significantly age the straws, even if present only at the level of a few ppm. This is a rather daunting task.

### Gas pipes

Pipes or tubes used for the supply of the active gas have always been the object of particular attention when analysing ageing effects in proportional chambers. Table 5 summarises the most important properties of the different types of tubes used for the gas-supply lines.

### PVC, Teflon and Neopren rubber tubes

These materials contain halogen atoms in the molecular chains. It is conceivable that some parts of these chains may be broken off and may then contaminate the active volume of the wire chamber, resulting in halogen contamination, which has been shown to cause severe problems of chamber ageing. Some molecular groups are particularly sensitive to radiation. One of them is the C-Cl group in PVC, from which HCl is produced under irradiation, a substance with a very high G-value (up to 23 at 70 \({}^{\rm o}\)C). The radiation hardness of PVC is known to be insufficient [8-29]. The strong impact of these materials on ageing processes has been discussed in many papers, e.g. [8-1], [8-2], [8-3], [8-4], [8-6], [8-7], and all authors unanimously recommend not to use such pipes for chambers exposed to high radiation doses. For example, the introduction of PVC tubes has been shown to initiate ageing, a process which continued even after the PVC tubes were replaced with the original stainless steel tubes [8-17]. This indicates a potentially very serious problem: once ageing is initiated, it may continue, even if the correct measures to prevent ageing are taken.

The studies of [8-17] were performed with an Ar/C\({}_{2}\)H\({}_{6}\) mixture, which has components initially prone to polymerisation. The next question is: what will happen with

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline \hline
**Name** & **Chemical** & **Radiation** & **Outgassing** & **Conclusion** \\  & **composition** & **hardness** & **(ageing)** & \\ \hline Stainless steel & Fe & Perfect & None & Perfect \\ Aluminium & Al & Perfect & None & Do not use \\  & & & Bad for CF\({}_{4}\) & \\ Copper & Cu & Perfect & Tube pollution & Do not use (unless \\  & & & & hydro- \\  & & & & gen-fired) \\ Nylon (RILSAN, & [HN(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{6}\)NHC & \(<\) few MRad & None (if not \\ polyamide) & =O(CH\({}_{2}\))\({}_{4}\)C=O)\({}_{n}\) & & under irradiation \\  & & & & \\  & & & & transparent \\  & & & to H\({}_{2}\)O & \\ Polyethylene & [CH\({}_{2}\)]\({}_{n}\) & \(<\) few MRad & Sometimes & Do not use \\ Polychlorvinyl & [CH\({}_{2}\)CHCl]\({}_{n}\) & \(<\) few MRad & Ageing & Do not use \\ Teflon & [CF\({}_{2}\)]\({}_{n}\) & \(<\) few MRad & Ageing & Do not use \\ Neopren rubber & [2(CH\({}_{2}\))CHCCl]\({}_{n}\) & \(<\) few MRad & Ageing & Do not use \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5.4: Properties of materials used for active gas tubes.

the TRT mixture, which does not contain polymerising components? Dedicated studies of ageing effects in straws fed by different lengths of PVC pipes have been performed. No permanent ageing effects were found, but some very strong dynamic ageing effects were observed. Actually, dynamic ageing effects usually denote the onset of permanent ageing.

The measured loss of gas gain in the TRT straws as a function of the length of the PVC tube used is shown in Figure 5-1. For these measurements, the straw was irradiated by an X-ray source providing a current density of 1 \(\mu\)A/cm. The gas flow was 0.05 cm\({}^{3}\)/min., corresponding to one volume/hour (as for the TRT at the LHC).

One can see that, even for a 10 cm length of the PVC tube, the loss of gas gain is around 10%. In Figure 5-2, the effect of using successive short pieces of PVC tubes is clearly seen: for these measurements, 15 straws were connected in series, using 12-14 mm long PVC tubes. All the observed dynamic ageing effects are due to the length of the PVC tubes, which increases as the number of connected straws increases.

##### Polyethylene tubes

There is no published information claiming that such tubes provoke strong ageing effects (only a small effect was observed in [8-35]), but, on the other hand, quite large outgassing was found in [8-36]. Polyethylene outgasses water, large alcanes and substituted aromatics. Polyethylene is not very radiation hard, since its mechanical properties degrade for doses above a few MRad (see [8-29] and [8-37]). Polyethylene also has a very high G-value of 2.1 and evaporates H\({}_{2}\) (95%) and C\({}_{3}\)H\({}_{8}\) (3.4%) [8-29]. Definitely, this material should not be used for the TRT tubes.

### Nylon (Polyamide, Rllsan)

These are the only types of plastic tubes, which are recommended in the literature for gas supply lines, provided their length is not too long (see e.g. [8-3]), but this only applies for cases where the tubes are not in a high-radiation environment. In addition, the G-value of polyamide is large, about 1.1 [8-29], but unfortunately there exists no information about the nature of possible outgassing components in this case. Polyamide is not a radiation-hard material and degradation of its mechanical properties already occurs for doses around 1 MRad. It is important to note that changes in the mechanical properties, even if not very significant in terms of the macroscopic properties of the material, nevertheless inevitably denote a change of chemical composition and therefore could lead to possibly large outgassing and also to loss of gas-tightness in the tube connections. It is well known that this material is highly transparent to water which could be extremely dangerous for the TRT gas (see Section 3).

It has to be stressed that all plastic tube materials (including Nylon) contain plasticisers, which diffuse out of the material and not only spoil the gas, as discussed in Section 3, but also degrade the mechanical properties of the plastic, which can lead to leaks (private communication with a representative from the 3M company, see also [8-24]). Irradiation can speed up such processes.

Plastic materials should therefore be banned from the active TRT gas system, at least for the parts under irradiation.

### Copper tubes

Copper tubes can trap oxygen and also react with some gases in the active gas mixture, e.g. CF4 dissociation products. One should be aware that silicon oils are frequently used during the copper extrusion process [8-2]. Some traces of polynuclear aromatics have also been found in such tubes [8-36]. The general recommendation of all the experts is to avoid copper tubes or, if there is no other choice, to use only hydrogen-fired copper tubes ([8-3], [8-6], etc.).

### Aluminium tubes

There is no objection to use such tubes, which are even recommended at times (see [8-6]), but one should remember that, in practice, they are not very convenient, since they do not accept multiple disconnection operations and can easily be broken. The above statements appear to be true for gas mixtures which do not contain any CF4. For CF4-containing mixtures, the use of Al is not recommended [8-23].

### Stainless-steel tubes

These tubes are recommended by all experts ([8-2], [8-3], [8-6], etc.).

Electro-polished stainless steel tubes are the perfect choice as a baseline to be used in the TRT active gas system. This applies to all tubes inside the experimental area UX15.

### Gas seals

Both fluids (different types of oils and greases) and solids are used as sealing materials.

A very dangerous source of contamination, often implicated in wire ageing, arises from oils and greases, which have not been rigorously excluded from the active gas system. They are often present as mould-release agents and as lubricants (e.g. in pumps, valves, seals, etc.). As mentioned above, Si-based oils are the most critical item: even a concentration of about 18 ppb (corresponding to \(1.4\cdot 10^{.8}\) torr vapour pressure) has been observed to give rise to significant ageing effects [8-38]. It is stressed in many publications that even oil-bubbles placed downstream of the chamber may cause ageing effects. **Only water bubbles or a direct exhaust of the gas without bubbler through a long tube should be used (if necessary).**

The other class of gas seals consists of solid seals. In particular, RTV-type seals (room-temperature vulcanisants) sometimes used for chamber sealing are often associated with ageing effects. It is also well established that Si-rubber (used in O-rings) produces Si-pollution of the gas and can be a source of ageing. Neopren rubber gaskets and O-rings are not recommended either.

When choosing sealing materials, one should not forget that many plastic materials react with CF\({}_{4}\). For example, materials such as Neopren, Teflon, Viton, PTFE may give problems because they swell in contact with CF\({}_{4}\) [8-24]. If there is no well-documented information that a given material can tolerate the TRT active gas system requirements, special studies are necessary to examine it before validating its use in the final TRT active gas system.

### Other elements of the gas system

The TRT active gas system [8-31] contains many standard elements, such as valves, flowmeters, pressure gauges, pressure and flow controllers, etc. Many of them may contain silicon or another type of lubricant or seal. For example, mechanical needle valves with GYROLOCK connections commonly used at CERN contain plenty of Si vacuum oil, and, in practice, it is not possible to clean them to the required level. **Only inspected bellow-based valves should be used**.

All the gas-system and detector elements should be very carefully analysed and cleaned before final assembly. A good example of such a cleaning procedure is given in [8-39]: the gas-system parts are washed in an alkaline solution (FLUKA RBS50), rinsed with distilled water and ethyl alcohol, and then baked in vacuum for several hours at \(100^{0}\) C. **Chlorinated solvents for cleaning should be prohibited from use.** Ultrasonic cleaning baths should probably also be foreseen.

No spontaneously chosen elements should ever be installed in the detector nor in the gas system, even for tests before real operation. One should never forget that even temporarily used elements may pollute the whole system forever ([8-2], [8-3], etc.).

### Purification agents

The primary goals of the purification agents in the TRT active gas system are the removal of water vapour, of oxygen, and of gaseous free radicals and polymers produced by ionisation processes and outgassing throughout the system [8-31]. Water is absorbed in a twin column packed with a 3A molecular sieve. A similar twin column is packed with active carbon to absorb mostly the larger molecules (polymers). A third twin column is packed with a reducing Ni-based agent (Leuna 6513), which removes oxydants.

When choosing these purification agents, one should not forget that they may also spoil the gas. For instance, a commercial molecular sieve (Linde Molecular Sieve Type 3A) has the chemical composition: K\({}_{9}\)Na\({}_{3}\)[(AlO\({}_{2}\))\({}_{12}\)(SiO\({}_{2}\))\({}_{12}\)]xH\({}_{2}\)O, and can therefore be a source of Si in the system. The impact of each agent on ageing should be carefully examined, and, if the effect were not demonstrated to be negligible, the need for the particular agent should be seriously reviewed.

## 6 Conclusions

Experimental conditions at the LHC imply very strong requirements for gaseous detectors. In order to be able to successfully operate such detectors for 10 years at the LHC, the materials for their construction should be carefully chosen and examined. Recommendations concerning the choice of the materials for the design of the detector and of the active gas system have been given wherever possible at the end of each Section, but further studies, particularly for materials after exposure to radiation and in contact with gas mixtures containing CF\({}_{4}\)-radiolysis products, are needed to reach final specifications and conclusions.
