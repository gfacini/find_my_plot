**I. Introduction**

The Shielding of the ATLAS Forward Region is of considerable importance for the whole ATLAS experiment. The background level in different subdetectors of the ATLAS detector will be determined by this shielding. The shielding shall be a huge construction that has to offer a large flexibility required for maintenance. The building of the shielding represents an enormous engineering and expensive task. In view of its implications for physics and the complexity of its construction, a close collaboration between physicists and engineers is desirable. Physics principles and results of Monte-Carlo simulations were confronted with experimental tests and yielded a physical concept of the shielding that has been examined by engineers to take into account the various materials, mechanical and construction constraints. The present note is reflecting the results of such a close collaboration that allowed the translation of the shielding physics concept into a practical engineering design.

**II. The physics principles of the neutron shielding**

Aside the ATLAS Forward Region (JF) shielding concept as formulated in the ATLAS TP [1], and re-used later on as a baseline concept in ATLAS TDR [2], another concepts [3, 4, 5, 6] have been proposed in the ATLAS TDR [2] and optimised since [7, 8].

The composition and structure of the shielding result from the goal it has to achieve, namely shielding against neutrons and photons copiously produced by high rate proton-proton collisions at small impact parameter and subsequent hadronic interactions in surrounding materials. High-energy particles generate hadronic cascades when entering material. If the material is thick enough, the cascade development continues until most of the charged particles are absorbed. For such a purpose, this material has to be as dense as possible. The remnants are mostly neutrons and associated gamma rays. While electromagnetically interacting constituents of a cascade are rapidly absorbed, neutrons will travel long distances losing their energy gradually. Nuclear capture of slow neutrons practically always results into a production of gamma rays, e.g. neutron absorption in steel is accompanied with highly energetic (up to 9 MeV) gamma rays production. Gammas also result from decay of spallation products and from fast neutron interactions with atomic nuclei. Most of neutrons and gammas should be confined in the shielding volume to make it effective. To achieve that, a outer layer of the forward region shielding should consist of a structure made of selected neutron and gamma absorbing materials combinedtowards the optimal moderation of unconfined fast neutrons and reduction of gamma ray produce by neutrons during the slowing down process in the shielding materials themselves.

The golden rule for neutron shielding is: "first moderate and then capture". The huge volumes of JF shielding materials offer a capability to moderate a large amount of neutrons inside, when light elements are introduced as part of shielding material. Such a role can be assigned to the carbon contained in cast iron. When such moderation takes place deeply inside the cast iron, then, due to the relatively high neutron absorption cross section of the iron, slowed neutrons and subsequently highly energetic gamma rays produced in radiative capture become confined in the shielding volume, what is an optimal case. It was the base of the idea [4] to implement into JF shielding cast iron with its intrinsic moderating capabilities due to a higher carbon content (3.5-4%), e.g. in a form of ductile iron.

Outer layers of the shielding should be designed to act as neutron absorber more effectively than cast iron. Among different elements one can distinguish two neutron absorbers which are very effective in slow neutron absorption. Lithium, which absorbs neutrons practically without gamma production, and boron, which is a better neutron absorber than lithium, however with 478 keV gamma rays produced after neutron capture. The energy of these gamma rays is low enough to be easily shielded by a subsequent layer of steel of sufficient thickness instead of using lead, which usually is automatically considered for gamma shielding. In addition, the use of steel to shield against residual gamma rays presents an advantage over lead regarding mechanical properties and cost. Moreover, one could expect lead to be a more intensive source of spallation neutrons compared to steel. If a lithium compound is used as final layer of neutron absorber, there is no need at all to use an additional gamma shield. The combination of these principles has yielded the concept of the segmented shielding [4], that has been tested experimentally [3] and optimised using Monte-Carlo simulations [7, 8] to find an optimal set up (cladding design) for the JF shielding.

## III. Technical Design Options

The original design of the ATLAS shielding proposed in ATLAS TDR [2] is shown in Fig. 1. The JF Forward Shielding consists of three removable parts (I, II, III) of conical shape which should allow assembly, disassembly and transport through the PX 14 and PX 16 vertical tunnels. In the original design, each of the three parts is composed of different layers of steel, polyethylene and lead.

Any technical design of the ATLAS Forward Region Shielding (JF Shielding) has to take into account several engineering constraints. These constraints can be divided into three main groups:

1. limitations due to the LHC parts and equipments (the LHC beam pipe, the TX1ST steel tube with diameter of 3000 mm) as well as ATLAS detectors (positions and dimensions of the muon wheel chambers and JN (end part of the whole shielding) Shielding);
2. limitations due to the crane loading capacity (2 times 140 tons) and crane range;
3. limitations of the supporting system (problem of center of gravity due to the impossibility to support the JF Shielding inside the muon chamber, track equilibrium due to the necessity of assembly and disassembly of JF Shielding).

Two technical designs of the JF shielding which respect the constraints mentioned above are investigated in this paper. They are presented in Figs. 2 and 3 for a conical shape option and in Figs. 4 and 5 for a cylindrical shape option. The originally proposed conical design [1,2] is mainly made of cast iron with the exception of part I where borated polyethylene (BPE) and steel layers are used (Figs. 2 and 3). The use of lighter material like BPE helps parallely to solve the existing problem of center of gravity. The cylindrical shape design made of three parts with different diameters [3,4,5] is based on the so-called segmented shielding solution, originally proposed in [5], with the five layers of steel, ductile iron, BPE, steel and lithium doped polyethylene (LiPE) as outer layer (Figs. 4 and 5).

The support system of such huge and massive parts of the shielding (hundreds of tons) is newly designed with the help of ribs which are integrated parts of ductile iron castings. The ribs for the conical and cylindrical shapes of the shielding are clearly seen in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4. In absence of ribs, as it was originally proposed [2], the conical shape solution suffers from a complicated design of the support system. The weight of massive ribs in part I helps to solve the center of gravity constraint created by the presence of the muon wheel chamber. On the other hand, the presence of ribs creates asymmetry of the construction near to the last muon wheel chamber. In the case of part II and III, the shape of the integrated ribs can be modified according to Fig. 6. Modified shape of the integrated ribs for parts II and III (decrease of weight, see Fig. 6) partly solves the problem of asymmetry. The shape of ribs in part I can be the same as for parts II and III, if enough space is available for the support of part I at position 12630 mm (see Fig. 5), thus solving the center of gravity constraint for part I. The asymmetry of the construction near to the last muon wheel chamber is suppressed as a consequence of the modified shape of the integrated ribs.

Moreover, any kind of JF Shielding with the outer layer for neutron shielding consisting of soft material such as polyethylene is more complicated for the conical shape with regards to production. The cylindrical shape design made of three parts with different diameters avoids this complication. Weights and centres of gravity have been calculated for both options. Results of these calculations are presented in Tab. 1 and Tab. 2. One can recognise that these conical and cylindrical solutions both fit into the construction constraint limits although the cylindrical solution presents a clear advantage in terms of simplicity to implement polyethylene layers into the shielding. However, one should keep in mind a possibility to replace polyethylene materials by water solutions with some of neutron absorbers (e.g. Li, B, see [9]). The water solution could be encapsulated in stainless steel water tanks. It allows a more easily inclusion of neutron absorption layers into the conical option. The vertical arrows in Figs. 3 and 5 show the centre of gravity locations and show that the limitations due to positions and dimensions of the muon wheel chambers is solved in both technical designs. The locking system, which should be designed to avoid leakage of neutrons and gamma rays along contact surfaces, is partly seen in Figs. 2 and 4 in vertical direction. The study of locking system in transverse dimension is still in progress.

## IV. Conclusions

The relatively complicated conical shape of the JF Shielding is not good with respect to technology due to manufacture of casing for polyethylene by cold-roll forming and filling by polyethylene plates. The segmented shielding has been proven experimentally and using simulations as the optimal solution for neutron and gamma shielding. This concept is applicable to both shapes of the shielding (conical and cylindrical) although its application to conical shape is not favoured due to higher cost. During the course of this work, other possible shieldings have been investigated by the group of ATLAS engineers responsible for technical design of the ATLAS shielding.
