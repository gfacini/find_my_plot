## 1 Introduction

This short note summarizes the latest noise figures in MeV for the ATLAS electronic calorimeter s with GaAs [1] or \(\sqrt{\rm{T}}\)[2] preamplifiers. They are obtained from ENI1 measurements on preamplifiers in the full ATLAS configuration2[3] as a function of the measured overall peaking time to the triangle \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) [_from D. Camin and Y. Jacquier_]. The noise is then fitted according to the equation3 :

Footnote 1: ENI=Equivalent Noise Current : with current sensitive preamplifiers, the electronic noise is referred to the input as a current (ENI) (similarly to ENC for the charge preamplifiers) and is usually expressed in nA _rms_.

Footnote 2: correct detector capacitance, cable length and dynamic range

Footnote 3: As shown in Ref. [6], the noise can be written :

\[ENI^{2}=5060\,\frac{e_{n}^{2}C_{d}^{2}}{t_{p}^{3}(\Delta)}+770\,\frac{i_{n}^{ 2}}{t_{p}(\Delta)} \tag{1}\]

in the units of nA _rms_, nV/\(\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}\), pF, ns and pA/\(\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}\). This equation is independent of the shaper and of the preamp risetime when the peaking time 5-100% is used. For cold current preamplifiers, the first term corresponds to the series noise and the second term to the parallel noise, dominated by the feedback and calibration resistors. For \(\sqrt{\rm{Hz}}\) preamps, the same slopes exist, but cannot be attributed to series or parallel noise as they depend on the cable length compared to the shaping time. In Eq.(2) the first term in \(A/t_{p}^{5}\) is added empirically to obtain a good fit at fast shaping and may come from an increasing shaper noise contribution due to second pole in the preamp [4].

The coefficients A, B and C are obtained for various detector capacitance values (corresponding to various rapidities) and are interpolated over the whole rapidity range to obtain a function of \(\eta\) (or \(\sin\,\theta\)).

The conversion into MeV is achieved from the measured nA/MeV ratio obtained in RD3, scaled by the new sampling fractions4 in ATLAS for the Barrel and the End-Cap [_from J. Colas and E. Monnier_].

Footnote 4: including the change in lead thickness at \(\eta=0.8\)

This provides a noise estimate as a function of \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) and \(\sin\,\theta\). Including the latest pileup noise figures (taking into account the empty bunches) [_from V. Tisserand_] yields the optimum shaping and noise figure at any rapidity. Examples are given for a 3 \(\times\) 7 cluster (without presampler5) in the Barrel (\(\eta=0\) and \(\eta=1.4\)) and in the middle of the End-Cap (\(\eta=2\)).

Footnote 5: The presampler has not been included (it is treated in Ref. [5]) but all the front strips in the cluster are taken which probably gives similar performance as an optimized cluster with presampler.

## 2 Barrel Calorimeter

### Conversion nA/MeV

On the RD3 calorimeter, the conversion factor \(I_{0}/E\) has been measured to be 2.33 nA/MeV in a nonnet and 2.57 nA/MeV in a large window [4], in fair agreement with calculations [6]. In ATLAS, the sampling fraction is larger as the lead is thinner (cf. Table 1) and the liquid argon gap is larger, which leads to a larger deposited charge. However, the drift time is also longer, especially when keeping the same high voltage6 (V=2 kV) (\(t_{dr}=455\) ns compared to 400 ns) which reduces in proportion the initial triangular current \(I_{0}\)[7].

Footnote 6: In RD3, the drift time has been measured \(t_{dr}=400\) ns with 1.9 mm Argon gap and 2 kV high voltage [7]. In ATLAS, raising the gap to 2.1 mm increases the drift time by 10 % but also lowers the electric field by 10 %. Using the parametrization for drift time versus electric field given in Ref [7] gives :

\[t_{dr}=\frac{400g}{1.9}\frac{1}{0.274\left(\frac{1.5\,\mathrm{V}}{g}\right)^{0. 222}-0.475} \tag{3}\]

\(t_{dr}\) in ns, g gap size in mm and U high voltage in V.

Thus, scaling with the sampling fractions calculated in Table 1 and drift times yields a conversion factor7 :

Footnote 7: the \(e/\mu\) ratio is included in the 2.57 nA/MeV measured on RD3. Taking \(W_{i}=24\) eV leads to \(e/\mu=0.76\), in good agreement with the values given by Montecarlo simulations [8].

\[\frac{I_{0}}{E}=\,2.57*\frac{0.247}{0.204}*\frac{400}{455}=\,2.74\,\,\mathrm{n \,A/MeV}\qquad 0<\eta<0.8\quad(48^{\circ}<\theta<90^{\circ}) \tag{4}\]

\[\frac{I_{0}}{E}=\,2.57*\frac{0.278}{0.204}*\frac{400}{455}=\,3.08\,\,\mathrm{n \,A/MeV}\qquad 0.8<\eta<1.4\quad(28^{\circ}<\theta<48^{\circ}) \tag{5}\]

### Noise with \(\emptyset\)T 50 \(\Omega\) in the Front sampling

The Front sampling is \(4.5\,X_{0}\) deep (tapered) and segmented in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.0031\,\times 0.1\). The detector capacitance8 is around 150 pF and \(\emptyset\)T preamps [2] are used with a 50 \(\Omega\) cable varying from 6 to 2 meters along \(\eta\). In this configuration, ENI has been measured (cf. Fig.3) and can be fitted as (cf. Table 3) :

Footnote 8: This is only the capacitance to ground, there is a crosstalk capacitance to the neighbours of similar value, which induces partially anti-correlated noise as a function of the cable length [9]. The net result in a cluster should therefore be checked.

\[ENI_{F}^{2}=\frac{0.5\,10^{8}}{t_{p}^{3}(\Delta)}+\frac{6\,10^{4}}{t_{p}( \Delta)}\qquad\forall\,\theta \tag{6}\]

where ENI is in nA _rms_ and \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) is the peaking time 5-100% to the triangle in ns. For example, at \(t_{p}(\Delta)=40\) ns, \(ENI_{F}=48\) nA. It is almost independent of \(\theta\) as the detector capacitance does not vary (because of the tapering) and the noise is little affected by the cable length at small \(C_{d}\).

ENI can be converted into energy, using Eq.(4) and (5) :

\[ENE_{F}=\frac{ENI_{F}}{2.74}\,\frac{\mathrm{MeV}}{\mathrm{nA}}\qquad 48^{o}< \theta<90^{o} \tag{7}\]

\[ENE_{F}=\frac{ENI_{F}}{3.08}\,\frac{\mathrm{MeV}}{\mathrm{nA}}\qquad 28^{o}< \theta<48^{o} \tag{8}\]

### Noise with GaAs in the Middle and Back samplings

The Middle sampling is 13 \(X_{0}/\sin\theta\) deep9[3], segmented in 0.025 x 0.025 and the Back sampling is 7.5 \(X_{0}/\sin\theta\), 0.025 \(\times\) 0.05, which leads to a similar detector capacitance. It increases with rapidity as the cell length scales as \(1/\sin\theta\). The maximum current also roughly scales with \(1/\sin\theta\) and is around 5 mA in the middle sampling at \(\eta=0\)10. In the Back sampling, the maximum current is less, but this does not change significantly the preamp noise and the calculations have been performed using the same figures in Middle and Back.

Footnote 9: In case of a tapered Middle sampling [10], Eq.(10) still holds, replacing \(\sin\theta\) by 1 nF/\(C_{d}\) in the first two terms (but not in the third one). For example, if it is tapered at 18 \(X_{0}\), \(C_{d}=1.5\) n F, which is equivalent to using \(\sin\theta=0.75\).

\[C_{d}=\frac{1\,\mathrm{nF}}{\sin\theta}\quad\Rightarrow\quad 1\,\mathrm{nF}<C_{d }<2.2\,\mathrm{nF}\qquad I_{0}<\frac{5\,\mathrm{mA}}{\sin\theta} \tag{9}\]

Current sensitive GaAs preamps [1] would be installed right onto the electrodes to amplify the detector current and achieve minimum white and coherent noise. The noise has been measured on bench at LAr temperature in three configurations : \(\eta=0\), 1 and 1.4corresponding to \(C_{d}=1\), 1.5 and 2.2 nF (cf. Fig.1), with the feedback network also scaled in accordance to accomodate the larger current11. The preamplifier used for the measurements exhibits a noise spectral density \(e_{n}=0.24\) nV/\(\sqrt{\rm Hz}\), which corresponds to the best figures so far obtained with these preamps12. The protection for high voltage sparking was not installed13. From the fit coefficients given in Table 3, the noise can be written :

Footnote 11: The maximum signal increases as \(1/\sin\theta\) in the Barrel. In ATLAS, both feedback and calibration resistors would scale with \(\sin\theta\) in order to produce an output signal proportionnal to \(E_{T}\).

Footnote 12: In Refs. [1], [4] and [3], the noise is comprised between 0.2 and 0.4 nV/\(\sqrt{\rm Hz}\), with an average value of 0.3 nV/\(\sqrt{\rm Hz}\) (at 60 mW power dissipation). Part of this dispersion was traced to internal second stage noise, which should be improved in the foreming version.

Footnote 13: It consists of 2 zearer diodes and an inductor, which increase the input capacitance by 150 pF and the series noise correspondingly.

\[ENI_{MB}^{2}=\frac{0.1\,10^{1.2}}{\sin^{4}\theta\,t_{p}^{5}(\Delta)}+\frac{2.4 \,10^{8}}{\sin^{2}\theta\,t_{p}^{3}(\Delta)}+\frac{3\,10^{4}}{\sin\theta\,t_{ p}(\Delta)} \tag{10}\]

ENI in nA _rms_ and \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) in ns. The dependence with \(\sin\theta\) is determined empirically14. ENI can be converted into energy using Eq.(4) and (5) as in Eq.(7) and (8).

Footnote 14: The series noise term \(\bf B\) is proportionnal to \(C_{d}^{2}\) (cf. Eq.(1)) which scales as \(1/\sin^{2}\theta\). The parallel noise term \(\bf C\) is proportionnal to the feedback and calibration resistors which scale as \(1/\sin\theta\). The shaper noise term \(\bf A\) should be proportionnal to \(C_{d}^{2}\) [4] but seems here to scale as \(C_{d}^{4}\) (cf. Table 3).

### Noise with \(\bf\bf\bf\Psi T\) 25 \(\Omega\) in the Middle and Back samplings

For large detector capacitance (\(C_{d}>1\) nF), a 25 \(\Omega\) cable gives better results than a 50 \(\Omega\) one, as can be seen comparing Fig.2 and Fig.3. In this section of the barrel, the cable would be typically from 1.5 to 5 meters long15. Similarly to GaAs preamps, the noise has been measured in three configurations : \(C_{d}=1\), 1.5 and 2.2 nF and the corresponding cable lengths16 (cf. Fig.2). There was also no protection against high voltage sparkings17. From the fit coefficients given in Table 3, the noise can be written :

Footnote 15: 1.5 m is for the end of the barrel, just beneath the feedhrus. It includes 40 cm inside the feedhrus and up to 50 cm outside to the electronic boxes, in case the \(\bf\bf\Psi T\) does not fit right on the feedhrus.

Footnote 16: The measurements have been performed at room temperature with 2 LEMO cables in parallel to obtain 25 \(\Omega\). When a more ATLAS like cable is used (kapton 1.2 mm) at liquid argon temperature, the noise improves by up to 40 % [12] as both signal attenuation and skin effect thermal noise are reduced.

Footnote 17: The HV protection is obtained with 4 or 6 1N4148 diodes and an inductor, which add around 10 pF giving negligible effect on noise performance.

\[ENI_{MB}^{2}=\frac{0.7\,10^{12}}{\sin^{2}\theta\,t_{p}^{5}(\Delta)}+\frac{4\,1 0^{8}}{\sin^{2}\theta\,t_{p}^{3}(\Delta)}+\frac{20\,10^{4}}{t_{p}(\Delta)} \tag{11}\]

ENI in nA _rms_ and \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) in ns. Again, the dependance with \(\sin\theta\) is determined empirically and slightly deteriorates towards 30\({}^{o}\). ENI can be converted into energy as in Eq.(7) and (8).

### Optimum noise

Summing quadratically the pileup noise and the total electronic noise in a 3 \(\times\) 7 cluster leads to an optimum shaping time to achieve the lowest noise at a given luminosity [6]. The electronic noise in a 3 \(\times\) 7 cluster is obtained by summing 48 cells in the Front18 (equipped with \(\emptyset\)T 50 \(\Omega\)) using Eq.(6) and 21+12 cells in Middle and Back, using Eq.(10) or (11) and converting into MeV with Eq.(4) and (5). The pileup noise in a 3 \(\times\) 7 cluster is taken from Ref. [11], corrected by \(\sqrt{4/3}\) to take into account the empty bunch every four :

Footnote 18: this large area may be pessimistic, but can be balanced with the omission of the presampler.

\[\sigma_{pu}^{2}=\frac{3330}{\sin^{2}\theta}*t_{p}(\Delta)\quad\mbox{MeV}^{2} \qquad\mbox{at}\quad\mathcal{L}=10^{34} \tag{12}\]

It corresponds to 365 MeV at 40 ns and \(\eta=0\).

The results are shown in Fig. 5 with GaAs preamps and Fig. 6 with \(\emptyset\)T. The optimum peaking time at \(\mathcal{L}=10^{33}\) and \(10^{34}\) as well as the various noise figures at this shaping are summarized in Table 4. At maximum luminosity, the total noise (electronics \(\oplus\) pileup amounts to : \(\sigma_{tot}=410\) MeV at \(t_{p}(\Delta)\approx 35\) ns with GaAs and \(\sigma_{tot}=460\) MeV at \(t_{p}(\Delta)\approx 45\) ns with \(\emptyset\)T. In the second half of the barrel (\(\eta=1\)), the optimum noise has also been computed using the actual measurements from Table 3 and are shown in Table 5, Fig.7 and 8. At maximum luminosity, \(\sigma_{tot}=614\) MeV with GaAs and 670 MeV with \(\emptyset\)T, correspnding to 398 and 434 MeV in transverse energy.

## 3 End-Cap calorimeter

### Conversion nA/MeV

In the End-Cap [13], the lead thickness is kept constant (1.7 mm in the outer wheel and 2.2 mm in the inner wheel) while the gap decreases, which changes the sampling fraction with rapidity (cf Table 2). However, the high voltage is also varied (from 2500 to 500 V in the outer wheel and 2500 to 1000 V in the inner wheel), to compensate largely this signal change, so that the ratio \(I_{0}/E\) can be taken constant as a first approximation19 :

Footnote 19: In the outer wheel, the calculation is done at \(\eta=1.5\) with a 2.6 mm gap and 2.4 kV high voltage, using Eq.(3). In the inner wheel, \(\eta=2.5\) with 2.7 mm gap and 2.5 kV.

\[\frac{I_{0}}{E}=2.57*\frac{0.280}{0.204}*\frac{400}{570}=2.48\mbox{ n A/MeV}\qquad 1.45<\eta<2.45\quad(10^{\circ}<\theta<27^{\circ}) \tag{13}\]

\[\frac{I_{0}}{E}=2.57*\frac{0.241}{0.204}*\frac{400}{590}=2.06\mbox{ nA/MeV}\qquad 2.5<\eta<3.2\quad(5^{\circ}<\theta<10^{\circ}) \tag{14}\]

### Noise with \(\emptyset\)T 50 \(\Omega\) in the Front sampling

The Front sampling is very similar to the barrel for the outer wheel, whereas the inner wheel has no fine segmentation. As shown in Fig.4, the detector capacitance is also here around 150 pF. The same equation giving ENI can be used there :

\[ENI_{F}^{2}=\frac{0.5\,10^{8}}{t_{p}^{3}(\Delta)}+\frac{6\,10^{4}}{t_{p}(\Delta )}\qquad\forall\,\theta \tag{15}\]

ENI is converted into energy, using Eq.(13) and Eq.(14).

### Noise with \(\emptyset\)T 50 \(\Omega\) in the Middle and Back samplings

As can be seen in Fig.4, The middle and Back samplings have a similar capacitance which varies largely with \(\eta\), but remains always smaller than 1 nF. In that case, the 50 \(\Omega\) cable gives the best results and would be typically from 4 to 6 meters long. Due to kinematic limits, the maximum current is roughly constant : \(I_{0}<6\) mA, corresponding to 2.5 TeV. The detector capacitance can be nicely fitted as [13] :

\[C_{d}=\alpha+\beta\,\mathrm{tan}^{2}\,\theta\qquad\qquad 400\,\mathrm{pF}<C_{d} <1000\,\mathrm{pF}\]

in which \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) are given in Fig.4.

From the fit coefficients given in Table 3, the noise can be written :

\[ENI_{MB}^{2}=\frac{10^{8}\,C_{d}^{3}}{t_{p}^{5}(\Delta)}+\frac{12\,10^{2}\,C_{ d}^{2}}{t_{p}^{3}(\Delta)}+\frac{7\,10^{4}}{t_{p}(\Delta)} \tag{16}\]

In which ENI is in nA, \(C_{d}\) in pF and \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) in ns. It should be noticed that the noise now decreases with rapidity, as oppposed to the barrel, as the detector capacitance goes down.

### Optimum noise

In the End-Cap, the noise is now decreasing with rapidity, whereas the pileup is still increasing as \(1/\sin\theta\). This advocates for shorter and shorter peaking times to minimize the pileup contribution, although the optimum peaking time will probably be determined by the fastest reasonnable value achievable. For timing and calibration accuracy20 this leads to a peaking time \(t_{p}(\Delta)=30\) ns. For example, the total noise is shown in Fig.9 in the middle of the outer wheel (\(\eta=2\)), and leads at 30 ns, to a total noise of 1250 MeV, corresponding to 360 MeV in transverse energy.

Footnote 20: as shown in Ref. [14], the timing accuracy obtained with multiple samples degrades very quickly when there are not enough samples on the waveform. With a 40 MHz digitization frequency, this corresponds to a peaking time of \(t_{p}(\Delta)=30\) ns. Moreover, at very short peaking times, the inductance effects which can affect differently the calibration and the detector signal start to show up.

Conclusion

The more accurate measurements in the ATLAS like configuration have not changed drastically the figures obtained previously [15]. At maximum luminosity, the optimum noise is around 410 MeV at \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) = 35 ns with the best GaAs preamplifiers in the Middle and Back sections and around 460 MeV at 45 ns with \(\emptyset\)T 25 \(\Omega\) preamps. In the End-Cap, the optimum shaping is limited by the fastest reasonnable value compatible with the digitization speed, leading to \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) = 30 ns. The noise is therefore dominated by the pileup noise at high luminosity, whereas the electronics noise is comparable (or lower) to the barrel figures. It should be emphasized that the electronic noise figures come from few measurements and should therefore be confirmed with more statistics or used with error bars, typically \(\pm\) 20%.
