**Abstract**

In this note the measurement of Xe density in TRT detector based on absorption method is described. This method uses double symmetric or asymmetric rectangular counters to evaluate the relative ratio of counting rates and hence the Xe density. The comparison of this method and method using two straws is presented. Preliminary results of measurements done for various setups and working conditions are also given.

The gas analysis system at TRT gas system contains also gas monitoring device, which provides continuous information about the absolute xenon density. Measurements of the xenon density are based on the \({}^{55}Fe\) (\(Mn\,K_{\alpha}\)-line, 5.9 keV) X-ray absorption in the xenon gas.

The scheme of measurements is shown in Fig 1. The setup contains two straws, which are situated one behind another with respect to \({}^{55}Fe\) source. These two straws can be replaced by double symmetric or asymmetric counter, rectangular in cross section. On Fig. 1,

\[I_{1}=I_{0}\cdot e^{-c\mu x_{1}} \tag{1}\]

and

\[I_{2}=I_{0}\cdot e^{-c\mu(x_{1}+x_{2})} \tag{2}\]

where:

* entering flux of X-ray,
* Xe relative density,
* Xe absorption coefficient,
* depth of absorption length.

Subsequently,

\[N_{1}=I_{0}\cdot(1-e^{-c\mu x_{1}}) \tag{3}\]

and

\[N_{2}=I_{0}\cdot e^{-c\mu x_{1}}\cdot(1-e^{-c\mu x_{2}}) \tag{4}\]

and from 3 and 4:

\[R=\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}=\frac{1-e^{-c\mu x_{1}}}{e^{-c\mu x_{1}}\cdot(1-e^{-c\mu x _{2}})} \tag{5}\]

It is seen from 5 that \(R\)-ratio is independent on \(I_{0}\). For fixed \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) the ratio \(R\) depends only on c - xenon relative density. The measured \(R\) is used to evaluate the xenon content.

Using two straws, due to their geometry, the X-ray source has to be strongly collimated and has to be rather narrow. For the setup with two straws having diameter \(\Phi=4\ mm\) or \(\Phi=8\ mm\) the ratio of counts, \(N_{1}/N_{2}\), for 70% of Xe is 2.79 and 7.78, respectively (values calculated using formulas 3 and 4). Accuracy of the Xe density measurements is also limited by the statistical errors. If we want to have statistical error in second straw below \(0.1\%\) one have to collect \(10^{6}\) pulses which is followed by \(\sim 2.8\times 10^{6}\) and \(\sim 7.8\times 10^{6}\) pulses in the first straw. Taking into account the values of \(R\)-ratio the total number of collected pulses, \(N_{1}+N_{2}\), should be \(3.8\times 10^{6}\) and \(8.8\times 10^{6}\), respectively. These rather enormous numbers of pulses should be collected at reasonable time of a few minutes. Remembering on strong X-ray beam collimation this leads to high order of magnitude of the radiation source activity of a few GBq. This setup is very sensitive to the linearity of the trail: radiation source - first straw - second straw. The displacement of the source leading to the change in absorption length from \(4.0\ mm\) to \(3.95\ mm\) is equivalent to the change in Xe concentration from \(70\%\) to \(69.2\%\).

Some above disadvantages can be eliminated by replacing the straws by double rectangular counter. For this geometry the detected X-ray beam should be parallel but not strongly collimated. The displacement of the X-ray source can also be neglected. For asymmetric counter, the number of pulses detected by both counter cells are comparable. For this setup, due to the ratio \(N_{1}/N_{2}\sim 1.5\) the total number of collected pulses required to keep statistical error below \(0.1\%\) is about \(2.5\times 10^{6}\). It improves the sensitivity of the method and also reduce the required source activity. In rectangular counter one can play with \(x_{1}\) and \(x_{2}\) values to get \(R\) as close to unity as possible. Simple calculation indicates that the best value of \(R\) can be achieved for \(x_{1}=3\ mm\), but it is not easy to manufacture so thin, uniform counter. In our measurements \(x_{1}\) has been frozen (\(x_{1}=4mm\)), and only \(x_{2}\) has been changing. Calibration curves have been made for the following depth of counter: \(4\ mm-4\ mm,4\ mm-10\ mm\) and \(4\ mm-15\ mm\). For the first two sets for Xe+isopentane mixture, for the last one for \(Xe/C0_{2}/CF_{4}\) mixture. Results are presented in Fig. 2-7 and summarized in Table 1.

This method based both on straws and rectangular counter is sensitive to proper choice of the threshold level of registered pulses. In Fig. 8 total number of pulses, \(N_{1}+N_{2}\), is shown as the function of Xe pressure. The virtual lost of the pulses observed with increasing Xe pressure is due to decreasing gas gain with increasing Xe pressure, while the threshold remains the same. These effects can be reduced by proper choice of the threshold and operating voltage of the counters.

In proposed method using rectangular counter one can measure the Xe density with the accuracy below \(0.5\%\). The best results were obtained for asymmetric counter having geometry \(4\ mm-15\ mm\).

The method of Xe concentration measurements based on the X-ray fluorescence analysis is now under study in our laboratory. The preliminary results for this method should be available soon.
