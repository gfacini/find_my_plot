# The effect of inner detector misalignments on track resolution

S.Snow, A.Weidberg

March 3, 1997

## 1 Introduction

We aim to define the alignment requirements of each of the ATLAS inner tracker components in each of the three directions. Throughout this note we are speaking of the final alignment, within a co-ordinate system centred on the beamspot, after all known corrections have been applied. So we do not deal with the sequence of steps such as survey, online alignment monitor and offline alignment with tracks, but only with the final result which is achieved by this process.

First we review the arguments which link the physics potential of Atlas to certain track reconstruction requirements. Then we simulate the effect of misalignments in the \(R\), \(R\phi\) and \(z\) directions on each of the track parameters. The TRT is dealt with seperately from the other subdetectors because it measures in only one direction which makes it simpler to align so it is treated with a different program.

Having found the effective resolution of the TRT with its expected alignment errors folded in, we then go on to look at the other components. This study is performed three times; once assuming that both pixels and strips have the same level of alignment errors, once assuming that strips are perfectly aligned and only pixels are misaligned, and once assuming perfect pixels and misaligned strips. None of these three scenarios is realistic but the results give us enough information to choose a realistic set of alignment requirements which allow us to meet the physics goals while minimising the demands on module alignment.

Finally the study is extended to the low luminosity layout which differs only in the addition of a pixel barrel at 4 cm from the beam.

## 2 Requirements

The requirements set on the performance of the inner tracker by the physics that we wish to do with Atlas were summarised in ref [1]. The strongest requirement is on the impact parameter (\(d_{0}\) ) resolution where there is really no lower limit from the physics; any improvement in \(d_{0}\) resolution can be directly used to improve the B physics performance of Atlas. Targets of \(\sigma_{d_{0}}<30\oplus 250/(p_{T}\sqrt{\sin\theta})\) microns at high luminosity and \(\sigma_{d_{0}}<14\oplus 72/(p_{T}\sqrt{\sin\theta})\) microns at low luminosity were chosen.

The next most important parameter is transverse momentum where \(\sigma_{p_{T}}/p_{T}<30\%\) at \(p_{T}=500\) GeV is required in order to indentify the charge of tracks from new resonances up to 1 TeV. With the detector \(R\phi\) resolutions chosen to meet the specs on \(p_{T}\) and \(d_{0}\) it turns out that the granularity of the detectors in the other direction is determined by the needs of pattern recognition. This leads to the SCT stereo angle of 40 mrad. The pixel dimension of 0.3 mm in the long direction is limited by technology, pattern recognition in the B layer would benefit from an even smaller value. So we end up with a detector which measures the track angle \(\theta\) to better than the 2 mrad resolution which is directly required by physics. Thus we might think it acceptable to set relaxed specifications on the detector alignment in the R and Z directions. But this might be a mistake because it would waste the precise \(\theta\) direction information about the track which will help to reduce the number of possible hits that could be associated to a given track hypothesis during pattern recognition.

This argument suggests that we should set the following more general specification; in order to make optimum use of our detector granularity the alignment errors should not increase the error of any track parameter by more than 20% relative to its value with perfect alignment.

Requirements for the TRT

We start by assuming perfectly aligned pixel and SCT detectors and look at the overall inner detector _pt_ resolution as a function of the individual straw resolution. The results were calculated using the TRACKERR[2] program and are shown in Figure 1. The intrinsic resolution of the straws is 170 microns and the straws can be aligned using the precision tracker to a precision of better than 30 microns[3] which clearly gives a negligable contribution to the individual straw resolution. However to be more conservative and allow for possible systematic effects we have modeled the TRT as four "super-layers" and the mis-alignments are assumed to apply to the super-layers. From a comparison of Figure 1 and Figure 2 we can see that a 70 micron resolution per super-layer is equivalent to the resolution of the perfectly aligned TRT (i.e. 170 micron straw resolution). Hence the effect of a 30 micron alignment precision on the straw super-layers is to degrade the effective resolution from 70 to 76 microns.

## 4 Method used on Pixels and SCT

The fast track parameterisation programs such as TRACKERR are not suitable for studying misalignment of detectors in all three dimensions at once. We require a "full" simulation in which tracks can be traced in three dimensions and their hits recorded in detectors which are displaced slightly from their nominal positions. The tracks are then fitted in three dimensions but the fitting program assumes that the detectors are exactly at their nominal positions.

This method has previously been used with DICE[5], but for the sake of speed we used another simulation (confusingly called TRAKER[4] ) which has the necessary details of three dimensional tracking and proper simulation of the small stereo angles in the SCT strips. TRAKER is a stand-alone program which represents the ATLAS inner tracker by means of a set of cylindrical or disk-shaped superlayers. Multiple Coulomb scattering and hit resolution in each superlayer are properly simulated and are taken into account in the track fit. The main limitations of TRAKER are that the pixel resolution has a fixed value independent of track angle, the B field is uniform, there are no nuclear interactions and the TRT is approximated with just 4 layers.

We represent the current ATLAS inner tracker layout with the superlayers described in Table 1. The pixels are simulated with \(10\times 50\) micron resolution The SCT modules are made up from two layers of strips each having the 22 micron resolution which was measured in the test beam and with 40 milliradians stereo angle between them. The TRT is approximated by four super-layers each having an ideal resolution of 70 microns which is degraded to 76 microns when we wish to simulate a realistic level of misalignment.

For each run 10000 tracks are generated with a flat pseudorapidity ( \(\eta\) ) distribution between \(-2.5\) and \(+2.5\). Analysis is performed in four separate \(\eta\) regions corresponding approximately to the barrel (\(|\eta|<1.1\)), overlap (\(1.1<|\eta|<1.6\)), forward (\(1.6<|\eta|<2.2\)) and far forward (\(2.2<|\eta|<2.5\)). The beam spot is taken to have Gaussian width of 15 microns perpendicular to the beam and 5.6 cm along the beam. All of the track parameters except for the impact parameter were taken from a fit which used the beam spot as a point on the track. A second fit, which did not use the beam spot, was done to find the impact parameter resolution. The transverse momentum of the generated tracks was fixed for each run and we generally did runs with \(p_{T}=4\), 10, 20, 100 and 500 GeV/c for each different alignment scenario.

## 5 Results without B layer

### One misalignment at a time

Figure 3 shows the resolution of the five track parameters in the case with no mis-alignment. This Figure gives the reference values of the track resolution which we use to compare with the track resolution that is found when we simulate imperfect alignment.

For example Figure 4 shows how the resolution of 100 GeV tracks is degraded by random module misalignments of up to 20 microns in the \(R\phi\) direction. Following [5] we take a 20% increase in the r.m.s. to be a significant degradation. So we would say that in this case the tightest limit on alignment comes from the impact parameter resolution which requires \(R\phi\) alignment better than 7 microns.

Another example is Figure 5 which is again for 100 GeV tracks but this time with module misalignments in the \(R\) direction. This shows that some track parameters are insensitive to \(R\) misalignment and there is a marked difference between barrel, overlap and forward regions. From the effect of \(R\) misalignment on \(z_{0}\) measurement we derive a limit of about 75 microns in the barrel region and 37 microns in the forward. Finally, Figure 6 shows the effect of module misalignment in the \(z\) direction.

Following the same procedure with all track momenta we found that the 100 GeV/c tracks always give alignment limits which are less than or equal to the limits from lower \(p_{T}\) tracks, while the 500 GeV/c tracks are very similar to the 100s. So we choose to derive the alignment limits from the \(p_{T}\)=100 GeV/c tracks and obtain the results summarised in Table 2. The analysis has been repeated with just the pixels misaligned and with just the strips misaligned.

### A more realistic scenario

Table 2 gives a lot of information on what alignment accuracy must be achieved in each subdetector in each direction but it is not the whole story. In reality there will be module misalignments in all three directions simultaneously and the degree of misalignment will depend on the support structure. We assume that it will be possible to achieve better alignment of the pixels than the SCT strips because they are spread over a significantly smaller volume. It is also likely that when placing and surveying the position of module on a supporting surface it is possible to achieve better alignment accuracy in the two directions which are parallel to the surface than in the perpendicular direction. With all this in mind we try to combine the information from Table 2 into a single set of alignment requirements.

#### 5.2.1 \(R\phi\) direction

The strips need to be aligned to 15-20 microns in order to reconstruct the \(z_{0}\) and \(\theta\) of the tracks and to 20-30 microns for the other track parameters. Suppose we choose to align the strips to 15 microns then we will have used up most of the available error budget for \(z_{0}\) and \(\theta\) but there will be some leeway left for the other parameters. Turning to the pixels, we find that they are very important for \(d_{0}\), requiring 9 micron alignment, but are not as important for the other parameters. Part of the \(d_{0}\) error budget has already been used up by the strips so we have to tighten up the pixel alignment slightly to 7 microns.

#### 5.2.2 \(R\) direction

Only \(\theta\) and \(z_{0}\) are significantly influenced by the \(R\) alignment of the modules. The pixels have more influence than the strips because they provide a pair of rather accurate \(z\) measurements seperated by a short distance in \(R\). A significant part of the \(\theta\) and \(z_{0}\) budget has already been used on the strips \(R\phi\) alignment so we had better exceed the 30 ( 300 ) microns indicated by Table 2 for the pixels ( strips ). Thus we choose 20 microns for the pixels and 100 microns for the strips.

#### 5.2.3 Z direction

Again \(\theta\) and \(z_{0}\) are the parameters mainly affected by misalignments in this direction. This time the limits from Table 2 are about 50 microns for the pixels and 400 microns for the strips. Again 20 microns alignment errors for the pixels and 100 microns for the strips looks like a reasonable first guess.

#### 5.2.4 Differences between barrels and disks

So far in this section we have assumed that the same alignment precision is required in barrel and forward regions. This is not always the case, as can be seen from the table, but the situation is often confused by the overlap region where tracks go through layers of both types. We could probably relax the \(z\) alignment of the pixel and SCT disks to 100-200 microns for those disks which are near to the barrel and possibly relax it even further for the far-foward disks.

Similarly the \(R\) alignment of the SCT barrel modules could be relaxed to 200 microns near \(\eta=0\), it only needs to be as good as 100 microns in those parts of the barrel which are in the overlap region. The mechanical stability of the forward SCT disks will be the same in the \(R\) and the \(R\phi\) directions so it is reasonable to demand rather good alignment of these modules in \(R\) in order to leave headroom for the more difficult \(z\) alignment.

#### 5.2.5 Results

Following the suggestions in the previous sections we have simulated a situation with different alignment errors in all four types of SCT component and three directions. The first guesses described above were not quite correct, they caused the \(d_{0}\) resolutions to worsen by more than 20% at all \(\eta\) and by 30% in the forward region, so we reduced the SCT strip \(R\phi\) misalignment from 15 to 12 microns and came to the final set of alignment parameters in Table 3. The performance of the tracker in this case is shown in Table 4.

## 6 Results with B layer

First we run a set of data in which the B layer is included and there is perfect alignment. The performance of the tracker as a function of transverse momentum is shown in Figure 7. By comparison with the high luminosity layout in Figure 3 it can be seen that combination of the B layer at 4 cm with the pixels at 11 and 14.5 cm now dominates measurements of \(d_{0}\), \(z_{0}\) and \(\theta\).

The next step is to run a simulation in which the B layer still has perfect alignment but the other components have the alignment errors which we derived in section 5. The result of this run was to show that none of the track parameters have degraded by as much as 20% with respect to their resolution with perfect alignment, so there is some slack which can be used up in alignment errors of the B layer. In order to determine how much slack and in which direction we have repeated the procedure of section 5.1 and looked at one misalignment at a time. The results are shown in Figures 8, 9 and 10. The jump up between the first and second point on each of these plots shows how the resolution was degraded by the alignment errors of the other components while the B layer still has perfect alignment. The remaining points show how the resolutions degrade further as the B layer becomes misaligned but the other components are not changed.

From Figure 8 we conclude that the \(R\phi\) alignment of the B layer must not exceed 7 microns for the sake of the impact parameter. Figures 9 and 10 show that in order to keep the \(z_{0}\) and \(\theta\) parameters within 20% we should align the B layer to 20 microns in \(z\) and 10 microns in \(R\). With these alignment errors applied we come to the performance shown in Table 5 which is satisfactory.

Looking at Table 3 one may wonder whether the 7 micron \(R\phi\) alignment of the outer pixels is really necessary in the B layer layout. It was chosen for the high luminosity layout where the pixels are the innermost layer,
