## 1 Introduction

Precise tracking in the proximity of the beam interaction and particle production point is essential for the LHC physics program, from jet flavour tagging to vertex identification and pile-up tagging. In the ATLAS detector [1], track reconstruction at small radii is performed with the pixel detector, originally consisting of three concentric barrel layers, surrounding the beam pipe at radii of 50.5, 88.5 and 120.5 mm. These are equipped with pixel modules read-out on a pitch of 50 \(\mu\)m in the transverse and 400 \(\mu\)m in the longitudinal direction. With the start of Run 2, the Insertable B Layer (IBL) has further enhanced the pixel detector tracking capabilities of ATLAS by providing space points closer to the interaction region [2; 3; 4].

The IBL consists of 14 longitudinal staves of pixel modules installed at an average radius of 33 mm around a new, thinner beam pipe. It is equipped with silicon sensors of two technologies, planar sensors 200 \(\mu\)m thick and 3D sensors 230 \(\mu\)m thick, both readout on a pitch of 50 \(\mu\)m and 250 \(\mu\)m in the transverse and longitudinal direction, respectively. Pixel hits are reconstructed from clusters of pixel cells having a signal above a predefined threshold. The performance of the IBL pixel sensors has been extensively studied in beam tests before the detector construction [5]. After the first year of data taking of the IBL detector within ATLAS at the LHC, it is important to evaluate this performance under the real operating conditions of the experiment and compare them to the predictions of the full ATLAS detector simulation [6]. This study reports the first results on the efficiency and hit spatial resolution of the IBL sensors using 13 TeV collision data and compares them to simulation.

## 2 Dataset and Analysis

The present study is based on the analysis of collision data collected with ATLAS in September 2015 during a period of good stability of the IBL. A stream of \(Z\rightarrow\mu\mu\) events selected in approximately 150 pb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data collected at 13 TeV is used for the IBL performance analysis. These events provide us with particle tracks at lower \(p_{\rm T}\) from hadronic jets and at high \(p_{\rm T}\) (up to approximately 120 GeV) from muons from \(Z\) decays. A sample of simulated \(Z\rightarrow\mu\mu\) events has been used for comparison with the collision data. It was generated with Pythia 8[7; 8], passed thorugh the full ATLAS detector simulation, reconstructed and analysed by the same program chain used for the data.

Tracks are requested to fulfill the following quality selection cuts, chosen to avoid a bias to the track sample: have at least 11 (9) associated hits in the Pixel and SCT detectors for tracks with \(|\eta|<1.65\) (\(|\eta|>1.65\)), at least 15 hits in the TRT detector and at least 2 associated hits in the three layers of pixel sensors other than the IBL [3]. The IBL is not included in the number of required hits in the pixel and SCT detectors. A loose track - primary vertex association is applied, requiring the transverse impact parameter, \(|d_{0}|<2.0\) mm and the longitudinal impact parameter \(|z_{0}\sin\theta|<3.0\) mm. In addition, the significance of the track \(d_{0}\) value, \(|d_{0}|/\sigma(d_{0})\), is required not to exceed 5, to minimise the contribution from secondary particles, and the track is requested to have \(p_{\rm T}>0.7\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.0\).

In order to minimise the dependance on the track extrapolation, this study uses the active region of adjacent IBL module overlaps in \(\phi\), that are approximately 1.5 mm wide and give two IBL hits for \(\sim\)7% of high momentum tracks. The display of an event showing a high-\(p_{\rm T}\) muon track traversing the IBL through the overlaps is given in Figure 1. The correlated hits in the two adjacent modules can be exploited to measure the sensor efficiency and the hit spatial resolution. This method has several advantages. First, using the difference of the position w.r.t. another IBL hit offers a better resolution and the effect of the uncertainty oftrack extrapolation due to geometrical and multiple scattering effects is reduced. Then, alignment effects are limited to the relative position of contiguous IBL modules and possible distortions or misalignements from other detectors are not mapped onto the measurements performed on the IBL. Finally, the sensitivity to the IBL hit spatial resolution is enhanced when we analyse the differences between two IBL hit positions compared to the IBL hit residual to the track extrapolation position.

## 3 Efficiency

The efficiency for reconstructing an IBL hit and associating it to a track is studied in collision events and compared to simulation adopting two different methods. First, the efficiency to reconstruct an IBL cluster and associate it to a particle track is studied. The efficiency is computed as the ratio of the selected tracks with at least one IBL hit associated to the total number of selected tracks. The tracking selection criteria discussed above are applied. In addition, unstable IBL modules are identified by computing the efficiency of each module on a run-by-run basis and flagging modules with efficiency lower by more than 10% compared to neighbouring modules. Tracks extrapolated to these modules, amounting to 0.7% of the selected track sample used in this analysis, are rejected for the efficiency calculation. Tracks extrapolated within a 3 mm region along the long module edge or within 4 mm from the module edge along the longitudinal coordinate, \(z\), are also not used for the efficiency calculation. The efficiency profile in the region at the module edges in \(z\) is discussed below. The efficiency depends on the hit density conditions on the IBL layer to which the particle track is extrapolated. ATLAS uses a Neural Network (NN) procedure to resolve hits from merged cluster where the energy deposition of two (or more) charged

Only tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>3.5\) GeV and pixel hits associated to those tracks are shown.

particles contribute to a single reconstructed cluster [9]. Cluster merging is observed for tracks having another charged particle at a distance, on the surface of the IBL module, smaller than few multiples of the pixel pitch. Therefore, IBL hit efficiency is studied as a function of the distance between the track trajectory extrapolated on the IBL and the closest track on the same surface. A degradation of the probability to reconstruct and associate an IBL hit to the track for distances below about 0.75 mm is observed (see the left panel of Figure 2), consistent with that reported in Ref. [10]. The difference in performance in data and simulation in the region at small track distance, dominated by merged clusters, corresponds to the response variation of the NN method in data compared to simulation, \(\sim\)5%, and it is interpreted as a difference in cluster properties in data and MC [11]. Therefore, a distance to the closest extrapolated track on the IBL surface larger than 2.5 mm is required for the tracks used for the IBL efficiency analysis. A total of 3.5 M tracks from collision data events are used for the efficiency calculation.

The dependence of the measured efficiency on the track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) exhibits a good agreement between data and simulated \(Z\rightarrow\mu\mu\) events, as shown in the right panel of Figure 2. Integrating over the momentum spectrum, we measure an IBL cluster efficiency of 0.9810\(\pm\)0.0005 and 0.9800\(\pm\)0.0008 for data and simulation, respectively, where the quoted uncertainty is statistical. The slight decrease in efficiency observed in both data and simulation at small values of the track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is interpreted as a residual contribution of non-primary particle tracks, having a softer \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum. By requiring that the generated particle originates within the beampipe, we measure in simulation an efficiency of 0.986\(\pm\)0.001, compared to 0.9800\(\pm\)0.0008, uniform as a function of the particle \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). At high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV) we obtain efficiency values of 0.992\(\pm\)0.004 and 0.990\(\pm\)0.009, for data and simulation, approaching the results obtained on single modules in beam tests with high energy hadrons [5].

An alternative way to estimate the IBL hit efficiency is to use tracks traversing the region where the IBL

The efficiency is computed as the fraction of selected tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>0.7\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) having an associated IBL cluster. Disabled and unstable IBL modules have been removed. The plot on the right has a track isolation cut requiring no other track extrapolated within 2.5 mm on the IBL surface.

modules overlap, as discussed above, and measure the rate at which hits appear on both modules. Tracks contained within a fiducial overlap region along the module, defined by removing a 0.25 mm strip along each of the module long edges and a 4 mm strip at each end of the module, and having \(p_{\rm T}>5\) GeV are selected to compute the ratio of these tracks having two associated IBL hits to those having at least a hit on the innermost of the two overlapping IBL modules. This method has the advantage of ensuring that the track under test passed through the IBL, thus eliminating the effect of non-primary particles discussed above, but uses only a small fraction of the tracks. We measure a ratio of 0.981\(\pm\)0.009 on data and 0.987\(\pm\)0.009 on simulation, that is in agreement with the values obtained above with the track extrapolation method, although with larger statistical uncertainty.

These values combine the intrinsic efficiency for reconstructing an hit on the IBL module and that for associating it to the track. Therefore, we further study particle tracks that traverse an IBL module and have no IBL hit associated. For these tracks we compute the distance between the position of their extrapolation on the IBL module and that of the closest IBL hit and compare the distribution of this distance to that of the residuals of tracks to their associated IBL hit. Only \(\sim\)8% of these tracks have an IBL hit at a distance smaller than 0.7 mm, while 95% of the tracks with an associated IBL hit have a residual smaller than that value in collision data. From this observation, by computing the product of the fraction of tracks with no IBL hit associated (2.4%) with the fraction of these tracks having a nearby IBL hit (8%) we conclude that the probability for a reconstructed IBL hit not to be associated to the particle track is below 0.5%. This conclusion is confirmed by a study where the efficiency for associating an IBL hit is computed for reconstructable tracks based on truth information from simulation. The difference in the efficiency to associate an IBL hit to such tracks compared to a reconstructed track is 0.7%.

In order to maximise the module efficiency without requiring overlaps along the longitudinal coordinate, the IBL sensors use a slim-edge technology ensuring efficient charge collection up to \(\sim\)200 \(\mu\)m from the Si edge, as measured in beam tests [5]. Here, the efficiency profile at the edge of a module is reconstructed

The right panel shows the ramp-up of sensor efficiency at the module edge.

using collision data and compared to simulation. Tracks fulfilling the quality cuts discussed above are extrapolated onto the IBL detector surface and the longitudinal position, \(z\), of the track crossing the sensor is computed. The efficiency profile along \(z\) is shown in Figure 3 and shows clear drops every 40 mm, corresponding to the transitions between adjacent modules. These efficiency drops account for the distance between contiguous modules on a stave, 205 \(\mu\)m on average, the intrinsic insensitive region of 200 \(\mu\)m at the module end and the profile of charge collection efficiency in the slim-edge sensor. The efficiency profile in these regions is smeared by the finite extrapolation resolution, that ranges from 70 to 250 \(\mu\)m, depending on the particle momentum and incidence angle.

The track extrapolation resolution along \(z\) is not sufficient to perform a precision determination of the turn-on of the efficiency of charge collection at the slim-edge of the sensor. However, the comparison between data and simulation, tuned on the efficiency profile from the beam test results, allows us to infer an overall agreement of performance.

## 4 Hit Spatial Resolution

The hit spatial resolution is one of the most crucial performance figures for pixel sensors in tracking applications. Not only it is desirable to achieve the best possible resolution within the technology and design constraints, it is also essential to precisely know this resolution when associating the IBL hit to a track candidate and perform the track fit, in order to obtain well-understood uncertainties of the track defining parameters, in particular the transverse, \(r-\phi\), and longitudinal, \(z\), impact parameter projections. The pixel pitch, but also the fluctuations in the energy release and secondary ionisation phenomena, such as \(\delta\)-ray emission, contribute to the hit resolution. An average intrinsic resolution of 9.0 \(\mu\)m and 59.5 \(\mu\)m is determined along the \(r-\phi\) and \(z\) projections, respectively, using simulated particle tracks where the position of the reconstructed hit is compared to that of the energy releases by the charged particle traversing the active Si thickness, averaged over the particle path.

We evaluate the IBL hit resolution for tracks from collision events in data and simulation using the IBL overlaps. Only tracks with two associated IBL hits, within fiducial regions along \(\phi\), are considered to compute the difference between the position of these two hits along \(r-\phi\) and \(z\). Since the track extrapolation resolution on the IBL module is typically of the order of, or larger than, the expected IBL hit resolution we want to measure, computing the residual between the track and the hit does not offer a reliable estimate of its spatial resolution. Instead the use of the IBL overlap compares two points having the same spatial accuracy, does not require any extrapolation resolution unfolding and does not depend on the track reconstruction and the alignment of the other ATLAS tracking detectors. In addition, it has been verified that the bowing effect of the IBL layer due to temperature changes [12] has a negligible impact on the measured resolution, due to the correlation in the displacement of overlapping modules.

In order to reduce the effect of multiple scattering, a tighter track selection, compared to that used for the efficiency study, is applied by requiring \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>3.5\) GeV. In addition, a cut at \(|\eta|<1\) is applied for computing the \(z\) resolution in order to ensure a uniform resolution response in this coordinate (see right panel of Figure 5). The use of the overlap regions for the resolution calculation makes the occurrence of clusters reconstructed at the edge of an IBL module, for which the charge interpolation may be inefficient, larger compared to the case when all reconstructed tracks with an associated IBL clusters are considered. Therefore, clusters reconstructed at the edge of an IBL module are not considered. Before computing the difference of the IBL cluster positions, the geometrical effects due to the different radial position of the IBL modules traversed by the particle track are corrected. These depend on the track \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), \(\phi\) and charge,in \(r-\phi\) projection, and on the track \(\theta\) angle, along \(z\). The distribution of the corrected hit position difference, \(\Delta(r-\phi)\) and \(\Delta z\), is used to determine the hit spatial resolution, \(\sigma_{\rm point}\). They are shown in Figure 4 comparing data to simulation. We extract the resolution \(\sigma_{\rm point}=\sigma_{\Delta}/\sqrt{2}\), where \(\sigma_{\Delta}\) is the fitted Gaussian width of the hit \(\Delta\) distributions, obtained on 5.7 k and 3 k selected IBL hit pairs for \(r\phi\) and \(z\) respectively. In doing this we assume the average resolution of the clusters on the two, overlapping IBL modules to be equal. This is a valid assumption for the IBL, since clusters recorded at the opposite edges of a module have similar size and overall properties. Resolution values of 10.0\(\pm\)0.1 \(\mu\)m and 66.5\(\pm\)0.8 \(\mu\)m on data, 9.3\(\pm\)0.2 \(\mu\)m and 65.3\(\pm\)0.8 \(\mu\)m on simulation are obtained for \(r-\phi\) (for \(|\eta|<2\)) and \(z\) (for \(|\eta|<1\)), respectively, where the quoted uncertainty is statistical.

Since the correction factors applied to account for the geometrical effects depend on the track \(p_{\rm T}\), \(\phi\) and \(\theta\), this may induce, in principle, a systematic uncertainty depending on the precision of the track parameters. However, we have verified that propagating the uncertainty on the track parameters to the measured hit resolution results in an additional uncertainty of the order of only one tenth of the statistical uncertainty. Therefore, the systematic effects due to the track parameters from the geometrical correction factor are considered to be negligeable at the level of accuracy of the results presented here.

The dependence of the measured IBL spatial resolution in \(r-\phi\) and \(z\) on the width of the cluster along the \(\phi\) projection and the track \(|\eta|\) value are shown in Figure 5.

In the \(r-\phi\) projection the spatial resolution values are extracted by unfolding the average resolution measured above from the width of the \(\Delta(r-\phi)\) distribution. The resolution for one- and two-pixel clusters agrees with the result obtained by explicitely selecting one or two pixels in both hits of the pair. Single pixel clusters are observed to have a resolution better than the binary readout value of \(\sigma_{\rm pitch}/\sqrt{12}\), since they select particles traversing the sensor in a region around the pixel center narrower than the pixel width. The width of this region depends on the track incidence angle. In simulation, this region has an average width of approximately 30 \(\mu\)m, consistent with the resolution obtained. The primary charge deposit by a

The distributions are obtained from samples of reconstructed particle tracks traversing the overlapping IBL modules and having two IBL hits associated, \(|\eta|<2\) for \(r-\phi\) and \(<1\) for \(z\), in selected \(Z\rightarrow\mu\mu\) events in collision data (circles with errors bars) and simulation (histogram). The curves represent the Gaussian fit to data.

single particle is generally contained within two pixels along the transverse coordinate, clusters that are broader that two pixels along the \(r-\phi\) projection typically include secondary ionisation and thus exhibit a degraded hit spatial resolution along that coordinate, mostly due to the effect of \(\delta\)-rays, as predicted by simulation. The evolution of the measured resolution along the longitudinal coordinate is interpreted as a convolution of the change of resolution with the increasing number of pixels used for charge interpolation and the increase of the multiple scattering effect.

## 5 Conclusion

The efficiency and spatial resolution of the IBL pixel sensors installed in ATLAS have been measured on collision data. We obtain efficiency values of 0.9810\(\pm\)0.0005 (stat.) and 0.992\(\pm\)0.004 (stat.) for the full \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum above 0.7 GeV and high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) tracks, respectively, in good agreement with simulation predictions. Efficiency values obtained using the track extrapolation method and the rate of hits in the IBL module overlaps also agree. The hit spatial resolution extracted from the distribution of the difference between the position of the IBL hits on contiguous staves in the region of overlap is 10.0\(\pm\)0.1 (stat.) \(\mu\)m and 66.5\(\pm\)0.8 (stat.) \(\mu\)m for the transverse, \(r-\phi\), and longitudinal, \(z\), respectively.
