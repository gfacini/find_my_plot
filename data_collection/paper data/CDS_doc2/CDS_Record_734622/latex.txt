# Report of the MDT IHEP Beijing Site Review

March 25 - 26, 2004

###### Abstract

The Atlas Muon Site Review Committee has visited the Institute of High Energy Physics in Beijing where the production of 32 BEE chambers and 16 BIS-8 chambers is foreseen. The Committee recognizes that these chambers present unique challenges because of the limited available space in the ATLAS detector. The IHEP group developed a design that meets these challenges.

During the review the IHEP group presented, in a series of talks, the status of the facilities and illustrated the procedures used for production and QA/QC. They further provided, prior to the meeting, complete documentation including manuals with detailed description of the operations involved in each activity. The Committee visited the facilities: the tube wiring and QA/QC were shown in operation, while the assembly of a chamber was shown in a video taken during the construction of module\(0\).

The Committee congratulates the IHEP group for the high standards achieved in developing the tube and chamber production and QA/QC facilities.

From the review discussions the Committee has a very positive overall impression of the group's achievements and recommends that the IHEP group proceed with tube and chamber construction. The recommendations of the Committee are discussed in detail below.

### Tube wiring and QA/QC

Tube wiring operation is well under control and the required production rate of 50 tubes/day can be maintained without difficulty. Tube QA/QC is also well under control and the decision of the IHEP group to go from the present dark current test stand for 24 tubes to the one for 48 tubes will certainly facilitate reaching a 50 tube/day rate for the QA/QC tests.

As a general remark, the Committee was particularly impressed by the very high percentage of tubes meeting ATLAS specifications at this very early stage of tube production (more than 600 MDT tubes produced with an acceptance rate of 98%).

The Committee recommends:

- Proceed with tube production in order to create a buffer of tubes ready for chamber assembly;

- Compile a list of critical components (capacitors, power supplies, etc.) subject to failure and insure that spares are available either locally or as a loan from other institutes;

- Periodically verify the compression of the swaged end-plugs and of the crimped pin on a sampling basis;

- Check the difference between the first and the second measurement of the wire tension and set aside tubes showing large differences for long term observation;

- Check the continuity of the tube wires before gluing the tubes in a layer.

### Chamber assembly

The chamber assembly procedures have been well developed and are capable of meeting the required production rate of six days per chamber. The module 0 has been finished in October 2003 and shipped to CERN for the X-ray tomograph measurement.

The measurement of module 0 carried out at CERN shows that the wire position (14 - 19 microns in rms) in both coordinates is within tolerances (20 microns in rms) when the built-in bow is taken into account, which indicates the module 0 has in general reached the ATLAS specifications. However, the Tomograph measurements showed a built-in bow of 40 and 60 microns on RO and HV sides, respectively. Also the gravitational sag was not acceptable. Consequently the IHEP group modified the design of the support structure in order to address these issues, and another chamber has been assembled in February 2004 with such modified support structure. The Committee concurs with their proposed changes.

### The Committee recommends:

-Whenever needed, the chamber should be held kinematically in three points: two on the RO side at the ends of the long beams, and one on the HV side at the center of the connecting bar of the spacer support.

-Great care has to be taken to avoid over-constraints on the spacer support structure that introduce deformations of the structure and consequently a deformation of the chamber when the stresses are released.

-Additional QA/QC operations, to check that no built-in bow is present when gluing the tube layers in the chamber, should be performed during chamber assembly.

An FEA analysis, performed by professor Colin Daly to clarify the mechanical behavior of the chamber, is reported in APPENDIX 1.

Detailed drawings showing the new chamber support structure and the way of supporting it (kinematical 3 point support), and two examples of assembly procedures avoiding over-constraints on the spacer support structure are included in APPENDIX 2.

A detailed description of the QA/QC operations to check that no built-in bow is present when gluing the tube layers in the chamber is reported in APPENDIX 3.

Taking into account the above indicated general recommendations, a new chamber should be made as soon as possible and checked on the CERN tomograph, in order to verify that the bow problem has been resolved. In the meantime the IHEP group should set-up the tooling for BIS8 and proceed with chamber production.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:4]

The FEA model of the BEE chamber was generated using Ansys(r) v8.0 and is shown above. The geometry of the aluminium spacer-support structure was extracted from the CAD file supplied by the Beijing IHEP group and then imported into Ansys. The details of the kinematic mount connections were omitted and replaced by extending the solid blocks at the ends of the long beams so that the support points were in the same positions as given in the CAD file. Other irrelevant details such as bolt holes were also omitted.

The multilayer was modeled in the same way as has been used for all of the end cap muon chambers. A section of a 4-layer multilayer consisting of the aluminium tubes and the epoxy adhesive was built in Ansys and then loaded in simple tension in each of the three orthogonal directions. The orthotropic moduli and Poisson's ratios were determined from the deflections of the model. The orthotropic shear moduli were found in a similar way. This data then determined the orthotropic properties of the elements used to model the multilayer.

An appropriate density was used to match the weight of the multilayer. The same properties were used in the end plug region with the density being increased to match the end plug weights.

The model was supported at the ends of the long beams and was loaded by gravity in the Y-direction, i.e. corresponding to a chamber position in ATLAS azimuth location 5.

The resulting deflection in the Y-direction is shown above. The maximum deflection of 120 \(\upmu\)m occurs at the middle of the long beams. The cross beams and the multilayer have much smaller deflection values.

This view clearly shows the deflection of the long beams and also shows that the multilayer is almost flat. The only significant motion of the multilayer is a translation of 96 \(\upmu\)m in the Y-direction. Note that the deflection is exaggerated by a factor of x150 in this view.

The view shows the deflections of the multilayer itself. The total range of the deflection is only 16 \(\mu\)m. The biggest deflections occur on the tube surfaces at the places where they are most influenced by the cross beams to which they are attached by the epoxy adhesive.

The most important deflections are those at the end plugs and the above figure shows that these have a total range of only 7 \(\mu\)m.

In conclusion, this analysis shows that the design changes incorporated by the Beijing IHEP group have been very successful in overcoming the gravitational sag problem seen in Module 0.

**Appendix 2**

Built in stresses of the spacer support structure, glued to the tube layers during chamber assembly, result in a deformation of the chamber when it is released from the assembly jig. This situation can be avoided reducing to a very low level the spacer structure deflection during chamber assembly, consequently reducing the chamber deformations due to built in stresses.

In the following, two examples of assembly procedures avoiding over constraints on the spacer support structure are described: in the first example the spacer structure is pre-assembled before starting the gluing of the tube layers in the chamber, while in the second example the spacer structure is assembled directly on top of the first layer glued to it (layer 4 of the chamber).

First example:

The chamber support structure is supported kinematically at three points: two on the RO side at the ends of the long beams (Figure 1), and one on the HV side at the center of the connecting bar that is connected kinematically to the ends of the long beams (Figure 2). Furthermore, when the spacer-structure is placed on the jig on the 3 positioning towers, a "point" support (by means of a sphere) is provided instead of large contact surfaces (Figures 3,4).

Figure 1: Two support points at RO end of long beams.

Figure 3: Support tower for RO end showing the sphere used to obtain a point contact.

Figure 2: Single support point on connecting bar at HV end of long beams.

(The connecting beam and its kinematic joints to the long beams are the parts actually used to support the chamber on the EC toroid).

Being supported as described above, the spacer structure is attached to the stiffback without introducing any stress.

The regular sequence for gluing the tube layers follows from here on.

Second example :

The basic idea is to assemble the spacer structure directly on top of the first glued layer (layer 4) without introducing stress:

1) - The two "cross-bars" (XBs, perpendicular to tubes) are checked against the granite table and should be flat to better than \(\sim\) 150 - 200 \(\mu\)m.

2) - The first layer of tubes is laid down, no glue. Each XBs is set onto the layer of tubes, but separated by a 20 x 20 cm\({}^{2}\), 250 \(\mu\)m foil (or metal shims or three wires*) placed over two sets of about six tubes (each). The two sets of tubes will be close to the Bessel points of the XB.

Figure 4: Support tower for HV end showing the sphere used to obtain a point contact on the connecting bar.

3) - The "long beams" (LBs) are glued to the top of the XBs while supported at their ends on a narrow strip which is placed on top the end-plugs. The XBs and LBs are glued together using the existing brackets. However, the brackets are bolted to the LBs and glued to the XBs using those bolts only loosely for security. No stress is put onto the XBs.

4) - The horizontal position of the spacer structure is checked against end plugs and tubes.

5) - The Stiffback (StB), set on the spheres, is glued to the spacer structure using the present method. Both "gluings" can be done sequentially without waiting for the glue to cure.

6) - After curing, the StB and spacer structure are hoisted up, foil (shim or wires) are removed, glue is applied on top of tube layer. StB plus spacer structure are then set down on spheres for spacer structure to be glued to tubes. The glue gap will accommodate small deformations of the spacer structure.

7) - Regular sequence for gluing the rest of the tube layers follows from here on.

## Appendix 3 QA/QC during chamber assembly:

The following proposed QA/QC procedures resulted from discussions between the IHEP group and the Review Committee.

* Spot-check the gaps between end-plugs of two layers. (at least 4 endplugs on each side, 8 in the middle.) This should be done first in a dry-run, then again after the layer comes down on the glue and again the next morning.
* Before lifting stiffback, check between combs and end-plugs, also with vacuum off.
* After chamber is completed remove stiffback and check gaps between combs and end-plugs; release vacuum and repeat.
* Lift the chamber kinematically (200 \(\upmu\)m) by using a 'three point' support : two points at RO side and one in the middle of the connecting bar at HV side. Use spheres at the three support locations to insure 'point' contacts. Spot check gaps between combs and end-plugs; the gaps should be all similar in the case in which no bow is present.
