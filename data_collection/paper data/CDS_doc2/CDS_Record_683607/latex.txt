## 1 General

During the last Tilecal week of November 1997, the question has been raised on how to define our needs in term of ADC resolution for the digital pipeline for the adopted shaper bi-gain solution.

S.-O. Holmgren has recently submitted a Tilecal Note (No-135) making the case for a full 10 bits ADC solution, which would make the cost of the digital pipeline more acceptable and at the same time it would simplify the power consumption problem. This particular proposal was based on a simple analytical calculation, which practically assumed 1 single readout cell for the hadronic shower.

With this study we aim to verify that work, using a realistic hadron shower model and simulating the Atlas scenario taking into account the required LSB resolution, the maximum saturation value of the energy signal and the possible pipeline characteristics.

Analysis technique

The idea is simple: we need realistic shower libraries in order to apply the digital pipeline resolution characteristics event by event and to reconstruct energy. It is even better if we can get showers that correspond to a perfect calorimeter with infinite sampling fraction. The spread in the total energy reconstructed in that case will just account for the internal resolution of the digital system. That will make comparisons easy.

We have used test beam pions impinging on the Tile Calorimeter at 90o in the middle of tile 7. The energy in the various readout cells is stored event by event in an array of energies for each PMT. Figure 1 a) shows the energy shape for 180 GeV pions for the sample of events used. Cuts on the data are just at the level of the beam definition (chambers, counters). The energy resolution of the distribution correspond to our detector performance (about \(\sigma\)/E=0.05 for 180 GeV pions). The mean energy corresponds to the electron energy scale, the difference between 180 GeV and 161 GeV accounts for an e/pi different from one. Now in order to get a shower library for a perfect calorimeter with infinite energy resolution, we have forced event by event the sum of all cell energy to be equal to the initial mean energy (in our 180 GeV case 161.1 GeV). In practice we have multiplied each PMT in each event by a given correction factor (same for each PMT, different event by event). Doing that, we have now a set of shower (PMT energies) cells which give a \(\sigma\)/E=0, with Emean=161.1 for 180 GeV pions. Internally the value of each cell is stored in pC. The scale there is the one of Atlas with 800pC=1000 GeV and 800pC as the maximum range of the low gain signal. Figure 1 b) shows the resolution for these showers is very precise (practical 0), the difference from 0 given just by some rounding errors.

Now that we have a set of perfect showers we can apply scenarios for the shaper and for the digital system. The resolution spread we will then measure will be just due to these experimental effects. To make our understanding easy we always correct back to GeV when we sum energies (1GeV=0.8 pC).The simulation of the digital system is based on 3 parameters:

1. The high-gain shaper gain value (expressed as GS)

2. The number of resolution bits of the high gain ADC (ADCH: 12 or 10)

3. The number of resolution bits of the low gain ADC (ADCL : 12 or 10)

The value 800 pC/GS=SATH, gives the saturation value of the high gain channel, while SATH/ ADCH=LSB, the resolution value for the high gain, which yields in practice the energy resolution of 1 ADC high gain count. The physics requirements there are that the LSB value should be smaller than the expected minimum electronics noise, in our case 20-30 MeV.

As a first approximation we use the same shower library to simulate all energies, loosing the difference in the shower profiles for the different energies. In particular, below 10 GeV this might be an optimistic approach. To check that assumption we have constructed showers using different pions test beam files (different energies, always at eta=1.3) and we have checked the other results (see Section 5).

## 3 10 bits versus 12 bits results on 90o pions

In Figure 3 a) we show the energy resolution for pions at different energies, for 3 different choices of electronics. The best resolution if of course obtained for the 12 bits ADC case, where the gain is 16, giving a LSB=15.25 MeV. Two other cases are presented in the same picture for the same LSB value.

In the case of 2x10bits ADCS, GS=64, the resolution is worse close to 16 GeV where we now switch from low to high gain. The maximum value is about 0.6% in the region above 10 GeV. Part of the problem is coming from the worse resolution of the low gain at these energies (977 MeV), yielding 6.5% resolution at 15 GeV. As a third case we have restored a gain of 16 and 12 bits at the high gain (to keep the LSB at 15.25 MeV) and 10 bits in the low gain channel. The 1 count resolution of 977 MeV lies now around 62 GeV (1.6% effect). This mixed solution is clearly much better.

Just to show some line shapes we show in Figure 2 different contributions to resolution for pions at 180 GeV for the 3 cases we have mentioned.

## 4 Can we afford different ADC resolutions between low and high gain?

It is clear that if we use 10 bits ADCs, to keep good LSB values we have to apply higher gains to the high gain shaper output. To get 15.25 MeV LSB we need a gain factor of 64.The question is if we can afford lower gains and therefore higher value for the LSB.If we can move back the gain value we will be able to do a better job on the electronics resolution contribution from 10 to 60 GeV. Figure 3 b) shows 5 different cases of different gain values (16, 24, 32, 48 and 64) and 10 bits ADCS in both channels.The case of a gain of 32 is an interesting one. The resolution is almost a factor 2 better and the LSB is about 30 MeV.

## 5 Cross-checks on pions at eta=1.3 and on electrons at 90\({}^{\circ}\)

We have in addition tested how well the 90o data reproduce the real tiled shower profiles for pions impinging from the front. We have applied the same procedure using data at 3 different energies and eta=1.3 in the extended barrel. The results are presented in Figure 4 as discrete measurements on top of the results obtained with pions at 90o. The results are very similar. Therefore we can assume that the sharing of energy for the different calorimeter regions is very similar and the method used is reasonable.

For electrons the sharing of energy is confined to 2 or maximum 4 PMTs. We expect in this case a worsening of the digital resolution contribution. Figure 5 presents the results obtained for electrons impinging at 90\({}^{\circ}\) for the 12 bit and the 10 bit solution. The resolution is worse near the region where we switch from the low to the high gain, but it is still below 1%. There the effect on the resulution is more visible also because the overall resolution function of the detector is more favorable for electrons. We will have to take care not to use during calibration electrons near to 40-60 GeV. This is probably one of the few points in favor of the 12 bits solution.

## 6 Conclusions

This analysis confirm the trend predicted in Note 135, but gives better resolution figures for the worst case (all 10 bits ADCS and shaper gain of 64). The contribution to the overall detector resolution is kept small, in the worst case it represents 9% of the expected detector resolution (value to be added in quadrature). The 10 bits case keeps the LSB at the original value of 15 MeV, which will allow the minimal muon signal to be 10-11 ADC counts, for a noise of less than 2 ADC counts. Gains of 64 might be problematic from the electronics point of view. Our electronics experts will have to say the final word on that. Lower gains might be a compromise.

In Atlas the situation will be even better because of the energy sharing between EM and Hadronic section. This is not taken into account in this study.

For electrons the contribution to the overall resolution is worse. This fact must be considered during calibration.

We have still to understand the electron case. In particular we have to see if the worse resolution for cell energies in the 40-60 GeV range does not induce problems (tails for example) for particular events with a large \(\pi^{0}\) content.
