**ABSTRACT**

Ageing studies are performed irradiating drift tubes with an \({}^{241}\)Am source. The tubes have different cathodes coatings, i.e. graphite, MoS\({}_{2}\), nickel, linseed oil, alodyned, anodized and bare aluminium. Furthermore the effect of different irradiation rates is studied placing the drift tubes at different distances from the source. So far three different gases were used or are in use: 1.) Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\) 91-5-4 (so-called Datcha gas), 2.) Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1 and 3.) Ar-CF\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94.5-0.5-2-3.

## Introduction

The muon spectrometer of the ATLAS detector will consist of aluminium drift tubes. In some regions of the muon spectrometer the count rate and thus the deposited charge is rather high. Background calculations show that the deposited charge can reach values up to 0.6 C/cm [1], if one includes a safety factor of five for uncertainties in the calculations. At these values losses in the performance of the drift tubes have to be negligible. In order to understand the process of ageing and how to achieve such a long lifetime, the following parameters are varied in ageing tests:

* Irradiation rate
* Cathode coating
* Gas mixture (and additives)

On the basis of previous experience [1, 2], where graphite and MoS\({}_{2}\) coated tubes did show much better ageing behaviour, coating was considered to be a possible remedy against ageing. Since it was (and is) not clear why these coatings were much better, a wide variety of coatings which seemed to be practicable is tested: Graphite coating, MoS\({}_{2}\), linseed oil*, nickel, anodized, alodyned (Cr\({}_{2}\)O\({}_{3}\)*H\({}_{2}\)O) and bare aluminium. From previous ageing tests it is known that ageing can be rate dependent [10, 11]. In order to be able to extrapolate from our ageing tests to real ATLAS conditions the rate of irradiation and thus the current per cm of wire is varied. Since there is an obvious influence of the gas mixture on ageing, several gases with good drift properties are tested: Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\) 91-5-4, Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1 and Ar-CF\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94.5-0.5-2-3. Additives which are believed to be a remedy against ageing [21, 1] like H\({}_{2}\)O and ethanol are tested as well.

This report is organised as follows: In the first section the drift properties of the gases used are shown. They have linear to semi-linear r-t relations and have a maximum drift time below 600 ns. The non-linear gas Ar-CO\({}_{2}\) 95-5 is shown for comparison as well. The problem of afterpulsing is discussed and averaged pulses are presented. In the second section the ageing setup is explained. In the third section the measured variables and parameters and typical measurements are shown. The fourth section gives an overview over the results and lifetimes. Finally a short summary and outlook is given.

## 1 Gas properties

In order to find an interesting gas for ageing studies, gases with good drift properties are searched for, i.e. gases with a linear r-t relation and a maximum drift time below 600 ns. Furthermore the gases have to be nonflammable. For this purpose computer simulations areFigure 1: r-t relation of various gases with no magnetic field at nominal gain (2*10\({}^{4}\)). The first two gases are linear, the latter gases are semi-linear to non-linear.

Figure 4: The linear gases have on average a higher longitudinal diffusion coefficient as compared to the other gases.

Figure 3: Lorentz angle at 3 bar, 0.6 Tesla. The Lorentz angle of a gas increases with its linearity. However, measurements showed a significantly decrease of the Lorentz angle for both linear gases by adding H\({}_{2}\)O (see text and [11]) to the drift gas, while the r-t relation is still linear.

performed using the Magboltz and Garfield programs [GARF97]. Gases chosen are Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\) 91-5-4, Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1 and Ar-CF\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94.5-0.5-2-3. The first mixture used for ageing tests was Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N-\({}_{2}\) 91-5-4, also known as Datcha gas. This gas has a linear r-t relation and as a short cut is therefore called a linear gas. The second gas used is Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1. This gas is also linear but faster than the Datcha gas. The third mixture is Ar-CF\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94.5-0.5-2-3. This gas is semi-linear, i.e. the r-t relation is linear only within the first half of the drift path (figure 1). For details of the drift properties see figure 1 through 4.

The drift properties of Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\) 91-5-4 and Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1 were tested in the 4\(\times\)4 chamber in the H8 test beam in a magnetic field up to 0.8 Tesla [KIRC97]. Also the influence of the water content was studied here. For water contents up to about 1000ppm (for the four component gas) or even up to 2000 ppm (for the Datcha gas) the drift velocity of the gases increases with increasing water content while the dependence of the r-t relation on the magnetic field decreases significantly. Since some experiments are known where water reduced ageing [VAVR86, KADY90] about 300ppm H\({}_{2}\)O is already added to most tubes in this setup. We plan to further increase the water content to optimise also the drift properties. In Ar-CF\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94.5-0.5-2-3 no water is added.

The gases were also checked for afterpulses. While there is no significant afterpulsing in the CH\({}_{4}\) containing gases at nominal gain of 2*10\({}^{4}\), there is some afterpulsing apparent in the CF\({}_{4}\) gas (figure 5). However, since there are some hints that CH\({}_{4}\)-free gases might show better ageing properties than gases containing CH\({}_{4}\) (section 4.2), this gas seems to be an interesting choice for an ageing test in spite of the afterpulses.

Table 1 shows how small changes in the operating parameters will influence the resolution by altering the r-t relation.

The main contribution to changes in the gas density N will come from temperature changes (2.9\({}^{\circ}\)C correspond to 1% change in N). The effect of tube displacement is calculated for tracks perpendicular to the displacement (\({}^{*}\) data from [SCHE97]).

### Gases which did not work

Originally it was planned to compare the 4-component gas Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1 with a gas where CH\({}_{4}\) is replaced by CF\({}_{4}\). This seemed to be an interesting choice, since this would allow a direct comparison between CH\({}_{4}\) and CF\({}_{4}\), i.e. only one parameter would be changed. Furthermore Ar-CF\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1 has a linear r-t relation. However, the quenching of CF\({}_{4}\) is significantly lower than that of CH\({}_{4}\), thus the mixture Ar-CF\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1 shows intolerable afterpulsing (see figure 6). As a compromise between little afterpulsing and linearity of the r-t relation Ar-CF\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94.5-0.5-2-3 was chosen. CO\({}_{2}\) is the main quencher in this gas. In general, it seems to be difficult to find a linear CH\({}_{4}\) free gas without afterpulsing.

A further option was the usage of about 0.5% N\({}_{2}\)O as an additive to the Datcha gas. Since N\({}_{2}\)O has interesting drift properties (makes gas fast and a linear r-t relation can be achieved) even the usage as a quencher instead of CH\({}_{4}\) was considered. However, N\({}_{2}\)O has an extremely high attachment coefficient in the drift region (where as e.g. CF\({}_{4}\) has a high attachment coefficient rather in the avalanche region near the wire). Thus hardly any pulses were visible after adding about 0.1% N\({}_{2}\)O. Raising the HV to increase the pulse height was limited by a dramatic increase in the current. Tests with N\({}_{2}\)O as an additive \(\mathcal{O}\)(100 ppm) are foreseen if a proper working point can be found.

Figure 5: Afterpulsing in Ar-CF\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94.5-0.5-2-3 in a bare aluminium tube (left) and alodyned tube (right) at 4*10\({}^{4}\) gas gain (3400V). The coating suppresses the afterpulses significantly and makes the gas a useful alternative to conventional gases with hydrocarbon quenchers. It must be noted that, although averaged pulses are shown here, they differ hardly from a single pulse, i.e. every pulse has an afterpulse of nearly the same relative height.

## 2 Ageing setup

Figure 7 and 8 show the main properties of the setup. Up to 16 tubes are placed around a point-like \({}^{241}\)Am source (spectrum see figure 9). Five bundles are available: Three have a source with 500 MBq, two have a source with 1.67 GBq. The corresponding count rates and currents for each tube in a given position can be found in table 2 and figure 7. Each tube is irradiated over a length of 2.5 cm. The rest of the tube is shielded using lead glued to each tube and a brass collimator directly around the source. ADC spectra are taken from the K\({}_{\alpha}\) radiation of molybdenum obtained by shielding the \({}^{241}\)Am source with a molybdenum foil (figure 12). To ensure the same irradiation rate of about 250 Hz/cm for tubes at different distances from the

Table 2: Main properties of the ageing setup. Please note that the count rate, the current and therefore also the charge are average values and can vary considerably from tube to tube. An example for the spread in the current can be found in figure 15. The high rate setup is running since 18.05.97, the low rate setup is running since 28.08.96. It is foreseen, to replace the 500 MBq sources with 1.67 GBq sources.

Figure 9: \({}^{241}\)Am \(\gamma\) spectrum at low gain (1*10\({}^{4}\)). Since the tubes are more efficient for low energy photons these dominate the spectrum seen by the tube (see also [1]). Spectra with a molybdenum shielded source can be seen in figure 12 and 13.

source several foils with different thicknesses are available. During ageing the gas gain is 5*10\({}^{4}\), while taking spectra the gain is 2*10\({}^{4}\). The current is determined by measuring the drop in voltage over a 332 k\(\Omega\) precision resistor which is placed between tube wall and common ground.

### The gas system

The gases are mixed using MKS flowmeters. The gas tubing is completely made of stainless steel. The admixture of water is done by using a bubbler at constant temperature. The gas flow is split and a fraction of the gas is sent through the bubbler containing double distilled water. A sensor is used to check the water content. Most of the tubes are operated at 0.5sl/h gas flow, a few are run at a tenth of that. The quality of the gases used is summarised in table 3 and gives an overview over the typical pollution in the drift gases. Further contaminations in the gas can come from outgassing of Viton, Elgelloy, Teflon and 316L SST (in the flowmeters), of Hastelloy and Kel-F (pressure reducer) and from the endplug of the tubes which are made of fibreglass.

## 3 Monitored variables and parameters

The main variables measured are the gas gain extracted from ADC-spectra, the current of each tube and it's count rate. Monitored parameters are the temperature (at several places in the setup), high voltage, water content, oxygen content, gas flow and pressure.

The ADC spectra are taken one to three times a week, depending on the irradiation rate. They give the main information about the status of a tube. At the end of a tube's lifetime either the

whole spectrum of the tube has shifted to the left, i.e. the gas gain in the irradiated zone has decreased homogeneously, or satellites are formed shifted to the left of the main molybdenum peak, while the main peak has a decreased number of entries (figure 13). The latter form of ageing is understood to be due to local gain variations which then spread over the whole irradiated part of the wire. However, sometimes these small inefficient zones can vanish, and the tube becomes fully efficient again. For an example of this kind of recovery see figure 12. The spectra are corrected for gas gain variations due to temperature changes in the lab. E.g. for the Datcha gas the gas gain raises 3.6% per \({}^{\circ}\)C at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C with raising temperature (see figure 10). Since most tubes die with local gain variations the position of the molybdenum peak

Figure 11: Change of average charge, count rate and current in a dying tube. Note that the increase in the current is not correlated with an increase in count rate.

is not a good measure for the change in gas gain. Instead, the average over the whole spectrum is taken. Together with the count rate of a tube and the measured current one can define the end of a tube's lifetime or efficiency (see figure 11). In this plot one of two typical courses of the current is seen: At the beginning of the decrease of gain seen by the ADC also the current drops. However, after a further decrease of the average ADC spectrum the current increases although the count rate still drops. Since there are no additional small pulses visible on a scope the origin of the current is believed to be due to single electrons extracted from the cathode which are amplified at the wire. The current is not self sustaining. A second course of the current is just that it follows the drop in the average charge deposited in the ADC. This is typical for the current in the current, but it is not a good measure for the current.

Figure 12: Change of spectra in an alodyned tube. The tube is fully efficient even during the buildup of the satellites. The sediments built up twice on the wire and then vanish again. This effect of so-called recovery happened in both cases when the CH\({}_{4}\) content in the gas was reduced. In the first case it happened when the broken CH\({}_{4}\) flowmeter was replaced and in the second case when the gas was changed from Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\) 91-5-4 or Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1. The total collected charge at 20.06.97 is 608 mC/cm.

all linseed oil coated tubes and most MoS\({}_{2}\) coated tubes but for no other coating. The charge collected by a tube is determined by the current seen in the beginning of a tube's life times the duration of irradiation. The end of a tube's life is in most cases determined clearly by a decrease in the average charge deposited in the ADC and/or the rather sharp reduction in count rate. A tube is defined dead if either the averaged charge is only 70% of the start value or the count rate dropped to 70%. However, a major uncertainty in determining the charge collected by a tube are the large fluctuations in the currents for tubes at the same distance from the source. The origin of these fluctuations is not always clear. Possible explanations are e.g. different gas gains due to small variations in the wire diameter (1.0 \(\mu\)m diameter variation corresponds to a change in gain of about 10%). To explore this possibility additional measurements can be made, using

Figure 13: Typical change of spectra in a dying uncoated tube. The satellite becomes dominant in the spectrum and no recovery is observed. The tube is declared dead at 08.01.97. A simple shift in the spectra of a dying tube is only observed for linseed oil coated tubes (no figure).

a different strongly collimated \({}^{241}\)Am source which can be moved along the tube at a distance of about 1cm. With this additional source gain variations due to small changes in the wire diameter can be seen, local gain variation due to ageing and the spread of the aged zone can be observed. Checks can be made whether a gain drop of a tube corresponds to ageing or if it corresponds to a malfunction of the preamplifier or the ADC. This measurement is performed each time a tube is put in or is removed from the ageing test. Using this measurement we have observed recovery in a MoS\({}_{2}\) coated tube (figure 14), electronic effects can clearly be excluded.

## 4 Ageing results

Ageing shows a clear dependence on the coating of the cathode and the CH\({}_{4}\) content. A rate effect of ageing has not yet been observed clearly, since it could not be disentangled from the influence of H\({}_{2}\)O content in the gas to ageing.

### Coating dependence

The coatings have a thickness of about 10 \(\mu\)m. Nickel coated tubes showed a significant X-ray fluorescence peak at 7.5 keV when irradiated with the \({}^{241}\)Am source. This lead to twice the normal count rate and a current, which was increased by 30%. Although one could expect also fluorescence peaks from the alodyned tubes (at 5.9 keV) and the MoS\({}_{2}\) coated tubes (at 17.4 keV) none of them were observed.

The ageing dependence on coating can be seen in figure 17. Each bar represents a tube. The black bars correspond to dead tubes (all dead tubes so far died during the usage of Datcha gas). The hashed bars represent the charge of a living tube collected with Datcha gas. The white bars represent the charge collected with the four-component gas. All these tubes are

Figure 14: Recovery in a MoS\({}_{2}\) coated tube. The pulse height was measured using a digital oscilloscope averaging over 1000 pulses while irradiating with an \({}^{241}\)Am source.

still fully efficient and are still irradiated. Coatings which show unfavourable ageing behaviour are linseed oil and MoS\({}_{2}\). In all linseed oil tubes the gas gain reduction started immediately. On average less than 20 mC/cm are collected before the tube is dead. The MoS\({}_{2}\) coated tubes have on average a higher lifetime, especially one tube that collected more than 1000 mC/cm. However, due to the large spread in lifetimes (some tubes died around 20 mC/cm) MoS\({}_{2}\) is considered an unreliable coating. Nickel does show a better ageing behaviour, however, due to X-ray fluorescence in these tube the count rate is doubled when irradiated with an \({}^{241}\)Am source and the current is about 30% higher. Furthermore the magnetic properties of nickel might have an influence on the overall magnetic field. The anodized tubes look rather promising so far. However, one can not really compare this coating against the others yet, since these tubes run only in the four component gas and this gas shows better ageing properties anyway.

Cathode surfaces which are considered rather good so far are graphite, alodyned and bare aluminium. However, none of these coatings guaranteed a reliable operation with Datcha gas up to 600 mC/cm. Although all alodyned tubes that died died rather early (at about 60 to 110 mC/cm), all of them died during a period of excessive CH\({}_{4}\) content in the gas due to a broken flowmeter. One third of all tubes which died so far, died during this period (figure 16). However, since the procedure to coat a tube with graphite is rather time consuming and thus not favourable for mass production, current studies (e.g. with the CF\({}_{4}\) gas) concentrate on bare Figure 17: Charge collected in the tubes with different coatings (bare aluminium, alodyned aluminium, graphite coating, nickel coating, MoS\({}_{2}\) coating, linseed oil coating and anodized aluminium). The status of 20.08.97 is shown. Dark bars correspond to dead tubes (died all during the use of Datcha gas), grey bars correspond to living tubes and charge collected in Datcha gas, white bars correspond to charge collected in Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1. On the very right side of the plot tubes are shown, which run in Ar-CF\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94.5-0.5-2-3. In this gas four bare and four alodyned tubes are in use.

and alodyned aluminium drift tubes. Alodyning might also have another advantage, that has been observed when CH\({}_{4}\) free gases were checked for afterpulsing. These tests were done in bare and alodyned tubes. It was found that these gases showed smaller or no afterpulsing in the alodyned tubes compared to the bare ones (figure 5). Similar tests with other coatings have not yet been performed.

### Methane content

The influence of the CH\({}_{4}\) content in the gas seems to be significant. In the period where the CH\({}_{4}\) content exceeded its normal value one third of all tubes died (figure 16). Furthermore, after setting the CH\({}_{4}\) content correctly again, some tubes which were only slightly damaged recovered. The same recovery happened again to several tubes when the gas was changed from the Datcha gas to the four component gas (figure 12). Since this gas is in use no tube died so far. This is now the longest period without a tube dying. Also the CH\({}_{4}\)-free gas shows better ageing behaviour than the Datcha gas. However, since CH\({}_{4}\)-free gases have a tendency for afterpulsing, alodyned tubes might be more advantageous.

### Rate effects and the influence of H\({}_{2}\)O

The ageing setup was also designed with the aim to study rate effects of ageing. This was achieved by placing the tubes at different distances from the source. It is known [10] that the ageing rate can change with the rate of irradiation, especially it was measured that ageing was proportional to the inverse of the current. That is, the ageing is dependent on the time of irradiation rather than on the total amount of charge collected. This seems to be true also for the ageing test with Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 92-3-5 [1]. Contrary to the preliminary results in [1] the ageing was just dependent on the time of irradiation for currents of 0.25 \(\mu\)A/cm and 0.83 \(\mu\)A/cm. In accelerated ageing tests (all ageing tests are accelerated) the amount of ageing per unit charge seems to be less at higher irradiation rates. This means that extrapolation to lower irradiation rates would give often too positive results. If one compares the lifetime of the dead tubes in our setup so far, one can see, that tubes in position 2 collected between 1.5 and 3.7 times less charges compared to tubes in the higher rate position 1. The only exception are the alodyned tubes, where the outer tube collected 1.4 times more charge than the inner tubes. However, since in the setup also the water content is different (either 300 ppm as in all tubes in position 1 or \(<\) 10 ppm in some places in position 2) one can not distinguish these two effects yet. If one assumed that no rate effects are present one would conclude that wet gases show better ageing behaviour. To distinguish these two possible effects a tube with dry gas in position 1 started to operate in June.

Summary and outlook

From the data available so far one cannot clearly favour one of the coatings studied. However, some coatings like linseed oil, MoS\({}_{2}\) and nickel can be excluded. The cathode surfaces considered best so far are bare and alodyned aluminium. The following tests will concentrate on these. However, none of these coatings allowed a stable operation for all tubes up to 600 mC/cm using Datcha gas even when water was added (300 ppm). A clear rate dependence of ageing could not yet be seen since first the data would also be consistent with a water effect and second the data have a "natural" spread which makes it difficult to give a consistent picture. To improve the tubes lifetime other gases than the Datcha gas with a reduced CH\({}_{4}\) content or no hydrocarbons at all are tested now. An improvement can already be seen: No tube died over the longest period so far since the change to the new gases.

Although the new gases with less CH\({}_{4}\) look very promising so far, we want to test possible alternatives in parallel. We just started to use alcohol (ethanol) at a 500 ppm level as an additive to Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1. In some tubes we will add 1500 ppm instead of 300 ppm H\({}_{2}\)O to minimise also the magnetic field dependence of the r-t relation of Ar-CH\({}_{4}\)-N\({}_{2}\)-CO\({}_{2}\) 94-3-2-1 [KIRC97]. Tests with N\({}_{2}\)O as an additive in the order of 100 ppm are foreseen if a proper working point can be found. Furthermore we search for other gases with a further reduced CH\({}_{4}\) content, linear r-t relation and as little afterpulsing as possible.
