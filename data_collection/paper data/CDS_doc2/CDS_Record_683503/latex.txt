**Abstract:**

An electromagnetic crimping device (EMCD), being developed in a collaborative undertaking between INFN-Pavia and the Laboratoria Elettrofisico Company of Milan [1], has been used to crimp aluminum tubes onto endplugs. We experimented with different voltage settings for the EMCD, and with modifications in the design of endplugs. Our preliminary conclusions, based on tests of a sample of 12 tubes, are that the method can provide adequate mechanical strength, good electrical grounding, and good helium-gas tightness, and appears to be a promising technique for constructing the "monitored" drift tubes (MDTs) for muon tracking chambers in ATLAS.

**The Tests and Endplug Designs:**

The tubes used in these studies were 50 cm long specimens, cut to size with hack saws from 220 cm long Menziken aluminum tubes [2]. The 50 cm tubes were fitted onto aluminum endplugs using a specially designed conical brass tool, which compressed the endplug O-rings as the endplugs were inserted into the tubes. A small amount of vacuum grease on the O-rings made it quite straightforward to perform these insertions. We tested the EMCD using six different endplug designs. Each tube was fitted with the same kind of endplug at either end, with the two endplugs differing only in the nature of their inner feedthroughs. One end had a capped endplug (not drilled through all the way), while the other end had an endplug with a threaded inner feedthrough that could be used for attaching pipes, etc, for performing pressure or leak tests and the like. The details of the designs are shown in Fig. 1.

Because the eventual MDTs will require the variation in the spacing between the inner surface of any tube and its anode wire to be \(<\)0.1 mm over the entire length of a chamber, and because the mechanics of positioning of the wire at the endplugs is not as yet a completely resolved matter, we felt that it would be interesting to determine the reliabilty and accuracy with which a tube could be crimped and aligned relative to some precise surface or direction. Consequently, we chose for these crimping studies endplug designs whose outer end diameters exceeded the nominal outer diameter of the tubes by about 0.1 mm. These endplugs had precision-turned surfaces with dispersions in diameter of \(<2\)over axial lengths of about 14 mm. The differences in the overall designs in Fig. 1 involve primarily modifications in the shapes of the grooves used as channels for holding the crimped tubes on their endplugs. Where any dimensions are not specified, they are to be understood as being identical to those of Design K-1. All designs, except for endplug K-3, had separate grooves for providing mechanical strength and gas tightness at the ends of the MDTs. For comparison, one tube was crimped mechanically with a previously designed crimping tool that was used in the successful construction of the first small (30 cm) prototype muon chamber.

The coil of the EMCD used for the crimping was embedded within an epoxy-fiberglass cylinder that was 18 mm wide (axially), and had a 110 mm outer diameter. The inner diameter was 30.2 mm, which was 0.1 mm larger than the largest transverse dimension (precision surface) of the endplugs. The region of intense magnetic field was 2-3 mm wide, and was centered on the coil. A capacitor bank, located outside of the coil was used to switch on the magnetic impulse. There was no feature available for the fine adjustment of the position of the tube relative to the coil, and the position of the endplug within the coil was therefore set by eye to an accuracy of about 1 mm.

**Results and Conclusions:**

The high voltage setting (HV) on the EMCD determined the power generated for the crimp. We therefore investigated the effect of this setting on the final diameter of the tube at the position of the crimp, on the electrical conductivity between the tube and endplug (all final values of resistance were found to be below 5 m\(\Omega\)), on the gas tightness of each tube (at the O-ring), on the rolling symmetry of the crimped tube, and on the overpressure (water) at which the endplugs were ejected from the tube. The details of the measurements are given in Table 1. The generated indentations were not completely symmetric, and consequently the depths of the crimps represent just typical values (dispersions in radius were about \(0.02-0.03\) mm). The depths of the crimps appear to be correlated with the depths of the grooves, and, except for two cases, the depths for any particular endplug design increased monotonically with increasing HV setting on the EMCD. The two exceptions could have been caused by the inability to control precise alignment in the crimping procedure. The crimps were usually \(0.5-0.9\) mm deep, and never reached their maximum mechanical depths of 1.4 - 2.0 mm. Also, except for one case, the endplug that was first dislodged under internal water pressure was the one that was crimped at lower HV. However, even the crimps made at lowest HV settings displayed more than adequate mechanical strength. The worst case withstood a pressure corresponding to a safety margin of more than a factor of 4 relative to the anticipated gas operation at 3-4 bar. (Both ends of the first tube of endplug design K-5 held pressure until the tube walls burst at 56 bar.)

The initial leak rate at the O-rings, measured with a Leybold UL500 helium gas detector, was typically in the range of 10-9 mbar-l/sec. The only exception Figure 1: En dplug designs used in these studies.

pertubarences from the lifting up of the ends of the tubes were found only for endplug designs K-5 (both tubes) and K-6 (Tube 2).

In principle, if the tubes had no bend, and the crimps were properly administered, the tubes would have rolled evenly on the outer precision surfaces of the two endplugs. This was the case for but a single tube. Most of the tubes rolled properly on only one endplug, while the other end rolled on the tube itself. We do not have sufficient data to interpret the results on rolling. Clearly, unless the angle of attachment of the tube at both ends is good to about 0.1 mr, the tube is not likely to be aligned relative to the endplugs (nor to an anode wire positioned relative to the endplugs), and will fail to roll properly. We observed that the angle of several tubes relative to the precision surface of the endplugs had initial angles of the order of 0.1 mr. Nevertheless, this was not the norm, and such failure would be unacceptable if endplugs were to serve as precision surfaces for aligning MDTs in a stack. However, independent of whether muon chambers are eventually constructed with reliance based upon the precision of surfaces of tubes or their endplugs, we feel that greater care in aligning the endplugs to tubes during crimping is desireable, if for no other reasons than simply to gauge any limitations on the precision of placement of anode wires. Consequently, in a follow-up investigation, we intend to line up the tubes at both endplugs to a transverse accuracy of 0.1 mm, and thereby determine whether we can attain the desired rolling symmetry in the final product. In addition, we hope to measure any relative axial motion between endplugs and tubes that may be produced during the crimping.
