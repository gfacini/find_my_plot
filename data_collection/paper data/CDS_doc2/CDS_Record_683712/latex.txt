**Protvino group experience with wire crimping**

IHEP(Protvino) MDT group

Protvino group has large experience with crimping of wires in copper capillary pipes by "crocodile"-like teeth squeezing of them. The method was successfully used many years for different kinds of detectors ( drift tubes, drift chambers ). We developed a method for quality control of the wire crimping. It is based on measurement of a force needed for withdrawing of the crimped wire from the copper pipe and comparison of this force with wire rupture limit. Typically we distinguish two cases:

* Bad crimp: wire can be withdrawn from the copper pipe or wire can be ruptured in region of crimp at tension force which is less than the wire rupture limit;
* Good crimp: wire can not be withdrawn from the copper pipe and only can be ruptured at tension force which is about of the wire rupture limit.

Because of there are some worries in MDT ATLAS community about our 'crocodile'-like teeth of the wire crimper, diameter of the copper pipe and something else, we decided to write a brief note summarizing our experience with wire crimping.

In table 1 we present a list of crimped wires in five examples. All wires were crimped in the copper capillary pipe with OD=1 mm and ID=0.27 mm.

1. The first one concerns to drift chambers/1 of the Serpukhov Neutrino Detector. We give only one reference for description of the chamber. People interesting more information can find it in IHEP and JINR preprints also.
2. The second example is crimping of wires in drift tubes with four field shaping wires/2/ of SPHINX setup in IHEP.
3. The third example was taken from setup used for test of wire creep/3/. In the table we did not list all wires of the setup. Total number of wires is 62. We presented in the table only wires with the largest tension.
4. The 4th line in the table concerns to crimping of wires in tubes of BIL chamber prototype/4/ being used now at DATCHA of CERN.
5. The last example describes tubes produced in Protvino/5/ for BML prototype constructed now in Frascati.

Here we should like to point out that 8 BML tubes successfully went through the special hard tests in LMU ( pressure, temperature and vibrations cycles ).1

Footnote 1: for more detail see presentation made by Th.Trefzger at PC working group meeting on May 1998.

Among presented results we know only one broken wire in BIL chamber. The wire is disconnected from HV side of tube. Reason of this is not known and also it is not known when the disconnection happened: during tube assembling, tests or transportations.

We should like to point out that presented list does not complete all our experience in this domain. We used only well documented examples. We can tell that our wire crimping technique was successfully used for crimping different material wires ( stainless steel, pure tungsten, gold plated tungsten, tungsten-rhenium, copper-berrillium ) with diameters from 30 to 200 \(\mu\)m.
