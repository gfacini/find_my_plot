The identification of jets containing \(b\)-hadrons, or \(b\)-tagging, is achieved in ATLAS using various approaches. A multivariate algorithm, denoted as MV2, has been widely used in many ATLAS Run 2 analyses. A technique is presented to measure the \(b\)-tagging efficiency of MV2 using multi-jet events considering jets spatially matched to muons. Proton-proton collision data corresponding to 14-767 pb\({}^{-1}\) collected by the ATLAS detector between 2016 and 2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV are used. The magnitude of the momentum of the muon projected onto the plane that is transverse to the combined muon and jet axis, \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm rel}\) is used in a profile-likelihood fit to determine the yields of jets containing \(b\)-hadrons in data. Thus the \(b\)-tagging efficiency in data can be extracted. The results are reported as ratios between the efficiency measured in data and that in simulation, referred to as scale factors. The scale factors for the \(b\)-tagging algorithm MV2 are reported as a function of the transverse momentum for calorimeter jets.

## 1 Introduction

The identification of jets containing \(b\)-hadrons, \(b\)-tagging, is an essential part of many different searches and measurements at the ATLAS experiment, including precision measurements in the top quark sector [1], Higgs couplings measurements [2] and a variety of searches for physics beyond the Standard Model [3]. As \(b\)-tagging plays a critical role, it is important to have a thorough understanding of its performance. The ratio between the \(b\)-tagging efficiency measured in data and that obtained using simulated events, the scale factor, is used to correct the efficiency in simulation. An extensive summary of flavour-tagging efforts at the ATLAS experiment in Run 1 and Run 2 can be found in Ref. [4] and Ref. [5], respectively. In ATLAS, the baseline \(b\)-tagging efficiency measurement relies on \(t\bar{t}\) events [5]. An orthogonal sample of jets from multi-jet events can be used to measure the \(b\)-tagging performance, where the jets are geometrically matched to muons. This alternative approach is subject to different sources of uncertainties and may be more precise, particularly in the low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range, where the \(t\bar{t}\) based calibration is dominated by the systematic uncertainties. The much larger cross-section of \(b\overline{b}\) events also allows it to achieve better statistical precision given the same luminosity. Moreover, it is based on different assumptions than the baseline method where the underlying hypothesis is that the top-quark decays exclusively into a bottom-quark and a \(W\) boson. Therefore the results of the alternative method can cross-check the ones provided by the baseline one. Moreover the two set of scale factors are statistically orthogonal: this opens to a future combination of the two calibrations.

The method adopted in this work relies on the fact that, given the larger masses of \(b\)-hadrons relative to hadrons containing only charm or light quarks, their decay products are more energetic. Therefore, the final state particles have larger momenta in the rest frame of the decaying hadron, referred to as \(p^{*}\). The momentum of the muon projected onto the plane that is transverse to the combined muon and jet axis, referred to as \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\), is strongly correlated with \(p^{*}\) of the muon and it is a quantity that can be measured in the laboratory frame at reconstruction level. The shape of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distribution is therefore also determined by the mass of the parent hadron. The discriminating power of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distributions can be used to determine the fraction of \(b\)-flavour jets that have passed or failed the \(b\)-tagging criterion so that the \(b\)-tagging efficiencies in data can be extracted. This method is hereafter referred to as the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) method [6]. This method considers the muon channel only as the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distribution for muons is less impacted by experimental effects due to their better momentum resolution, higher reconstruction efficiency and lower fake rate. Figure 1 illustrates \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) of the muon and it can be expressed as Eq. 1:

\[p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}=||\vec{p}_{\mu}\times\vec{u}||,\ \mathrm{where}\ \vec{u}=\frac{\vec{p}_{\mathrm{jet}}+\vec{p}_{\mu}}{||\vec{p}_{\mathrm{jet}}+ \vec{p}_{\mu}||}. \tag{1}\]

The MV2 tagger, a classifier which consists of a set of gradient-boosted decision tree (BDT) algorithms [7] has been widely used in many Run 2 ATLAS physics analyses. These BDT algorithms use a set of 24 jet flavour-sensitive variables, exploiting different \(b\)-hadron decay characteristics. It is trained on a simulation sample of \(b\)-jets with the background consisting of 7% \(c\)-jets and 93% light jets. The output of MV2 is a number between -1 and 1, with larger positive values corresponding to a higher probability of a jet containing \(b\)-hadrons. A set of operating points (OPs) is defined, which are cut values placed on the output corresponding to a nominal \(b\)-tagging efficiency determined in a \(t\bar{t}\) MC sample. This note reports the calibration of four fixed cut OPs, corresponding to 60%, 70%, 77% and 85% \(b\)-tagging efficiencies, using proton-proton (\(pp\)) collision data corresponding to 14-767 pb\({}^{-1}\) collected by the ATLAS detector between2016 and 2018 at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV. A profile-likelihood fit is performed, where the predicted \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) templates for \(b\)- and \(c\)-jets are derived using Monte Carlo (MC) while the template for \(light\)-jets is extracted using a data-driven approach. The normalisations of these templates are then fitted to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distributions of a data sample of jets, one satisfying the \(b\)-tagging criterion and one failing the \(b\)-tagging criterion. The fit determines the yields of \(b\)-jets in each sample and hence the \(b\)-tagging efficiency as follows:

\[\varepsilon_{b}=\frac{N_{b}^{\mathrm{tagged}}}{N_{b}^{\mathrm{tagged}}+N_{b}^{ \mathrm{fail}}}, \tag{2}\]

where \(N_{b}^{\mathrm{tagged}}\) is the number of \(b\)-jets passing the algorithm and \(N_{b}^{\mathrm{fail}}\) is the number of \(b\)-jets failing the algorithm. The \(b\)-tagging efficiency in data can consequently be compared to the efficiency predicted in simulation. The ratio of these two values is referred to as the _scale factor_, SF\({}_{b}\), as shown in (3):

\[SF_{b}=\frac{\varepsilon_{b}^{\mathrm{data}}}{\varepsilon_{b}^{\mathrm{MC}}}. \tag{3}\]

The measurement is performed in bins of jet transverse momentum, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\), and the choice of bin boundaries is driven by the triggers used (see Section 3). This note is structured as follows: the data and simulated event samples used in this work are listed in Section 2. The objects and event selection is given in Section 3 while

The final state muon is shown in a solid single arrow as well as the projection of its momentum transverse to the jet + muon axis (dashed arrow), the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\), shown as a solid double arrow.

the details of the template derivation and fitting strategy are discussed in Section 4. Various systematic effects are taken into account for the estimation of the total uncertainty on \(\varepsilon_{b}^{\text{data}}\), presented in Section 5. The resulting scale factors are shown in Section 6.

## 2 Data and simulated event samples

Data used in this calibration were collected with the ATLAS detector from proton-proton collision at the LHC with a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV from 2016 to 2018. The events must pass a set of muon-in-jet triggers, only active starting from 2016, that requires a muon to be spatially matched to a jet, with both passing certain \(p_{\text{T}}\) thresholds. This set of muon-in-jet triggers have a jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) threshold ranging from 15 GeV to 110 GeV and a muon \(p_{\text{T}}\) threshold of either 4 GeV (if the jet has a \(p_{\text{T}}<85\) GeV) or 6 GeV (if the jet has a \(p_{\text{T}}>85\)GeV). The spatial matching is made within a cone of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}<0.5\) around the jet axis1. The muon must have \(|\Delta z|<2\) mm, where \(|\Delta z|\) is the distance of closest approach along the beam axis of the muon track to the primary vertex. Due to the steeply falling jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) spectrum and the large cross section of multi-jet events, only a fraction of events fulfilling the muon-in-jet trigger requirement are recorded, where the recorded fraction, determined by the trigger pre-scale factor, varies for each muon-in-jet trigger. The recorded luminosity corresponds to 14.9 pb\({}^{-1}\) for the lowest threshold and 0.77 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the highest threshold.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r,\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. \(\eta\) is pseudorapidity.

The measurement is performed in various jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) bins determined by the muon-in-jet triggers. In each \(p_{\text{T}}\) bin, the events are collected by the trigger with the smallest pre-scale factor that yields a smoothly falling jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) spectrum offline within the bin boundaries. The boundaries are determined by the trigger efficiencies measured via a bootstrap method. The \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) bins considered are [20-30] GeV, [30-40] GeV, [40-50] GeV, [50-70] GeV, [70-90] GeV and [90-140] GeV. The effective luminosities collected by each trigger are listed in Table 1.

Two sets of simulated multi-jet events are used, one with a muon-in-jet filter (muon-filtered) and one without such a filter (unfiltered). The muon-in-jet filter requires a muon with \(p_{\text{T}}~{}>\) 3 GeV at the generator level. The muon-filtered multi-jet events were generated with Pythia 8(v.243) [8], using the leading-order (LO) NNPDF2.3 PDF set [9] and the A14 [10, 11] parton shower and hadronisation tune. The sample is divided into multiple \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) slices to provide sufficient events across the entire \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) spectrum. The unfiltered

\end{table}
Table 1: Summary of \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{jet}}\) bins and the thresholds applied in the corresponding triggers.

multi-jet events were generated with Pythia 8(v.235) with the same PDF set and tune as the muon-filtered ones. This sample is also divided into multiple \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) slices.

The EvtGen simulation package [12] is used to fully simulate the decays of \(c\)-hadrons and \(b\)-hadrons. EvtGen v.1.7.0 and v.1.6.0 are used in the muon-filtered and unfiltered simulations, respectively. All simulated events are passed through the full ATLAS detector simulation based on the Geant 4 toolkit [13]. Additional \(pp\) interactions (pile-up) from the same and neighbouring bunch crossings were taken into account by generating a number of inelastic \(pp\) interactions with Pythia 8.186 using the LO NNPDF2.3 PDF set and the A3 tune [14]. These events were then overlaid with the hard-scattering events. All simulated events are weighted so that the distributions of the average number of collisions per bunch crossing match those in data.

## 3 Event reconstruction and selection

### Object selection

The event must contain a primary vertex with at least two tracks having \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) higher than \(500\,\mathrm{MeV}\). If more than one primary vertex is found, the one with the highest \(\Sigma p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}\) of associated tracks is chosen. Selected data events are required to be of good quality, with all relevant components of the ATLAS detector in good working conditions [15].

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\)[16] algorithm with \(R\) = 0.4 from noise-suppressed topological energy depositions [17]. The jets must have \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\,\mathrm{GeV}\). Jet transverse momenta are corrected to the corresponding particle-level jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), based on simulation. Remaining differences between data and simulated events are evaluated and corrected for using in situ techniques [18]. Additionally, jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<120\,\mathrm{GeV}\) must satisfy the medium working point of the Jet Vertex Tagger (JVT), which reduces the number of pile-up jets by a factor of \(\sim 10-100\) while retaining 92% of true hard scattering collisions [19]. A correction to the simulated events is applied to rescale the JVT efficiency in simulation to match that measured in data [19].

The flavour of a given jet in simulation is determined by iterative truth matching within \(\Delta R<0.3\) around the jet-axis. Each jet has a corresponding _truth record_ which encodes the chain of particle decays which produced the jet, starting from the initial collision. The truth record is first checked for any \(b\)-hadrons and labelled accordingly if one is found. If no \(b\)-hadrons are present, a similar check is done for \(c\)-hadrons and then \(\tau\)-leptons. The \(b\)-hadrons, \(c\)-hadrons, and \(\tau\)-leptons are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\geq 5\,\mathrm{GeV}\). If no \(\tau\)-leptons, \(b\)- or \(c\)-hadrons are identified in the truth record, the jet is labelled as light.

To select semileptonic \(b\)-hadron decays and suppress light jets, the event is required to contain at least one muon above certain muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds. Muon tracks are reconstructed independently in the inner detector and the muon spectrometer. Finally the information from both the inner detector and muon spectrometer systems is used in a combined fit to refine the muon momentum measurement [20]. Since muons inside more energetic jets have a harder \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum, the muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold requirement depends on the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range considered. The muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold also helps to suppress light jet contributions at high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) and maintain a relatively flat ratio of \(b\) to \(c\) to light jets. Muons must also be spatially matched to a jet within a \(\Delta R<0.4\) cone. In addition, the muons are required to satisfy \(|\eta|<2.5\), \(d_{0}<2\,\mathrm{mm}\) and \(|z_{0}\cdot\sin\theta|<4\,\mathrm{mm}\)where \(d_{0}\) and \(z_{0}\) and the transverse and longitudinal impact parameters, respectively2. The fraction of muons with \(d_{0}<2\) mm matched to a truth bottom jet is calculated using the simulation and it is found to be around 99.6%. This value is found to be constant as a function of the muon pseudorapidity. Only muons satisfying the _tight_ quality selection criteria are used to ensure a good muon resolution and to suppress fake muons (for example, decay-in-flight or combinatorial fakes) [20]. Since this calibration considers a muon-in-jet topology, no isolation or muon-jet overlap removal is applied. The reconstruction and identification efficiencies of the muons used in this analysis are measured in data events. Scale factors are derived using the tag-and-probe method on \(Z\rightarrow\mu\mu\), \(W\rightarrow\mu\nu\) and \(J/\Psi\rightarrow\mu\mu\) events and applied to the simulated event samples [20]. The object selections are summarized in Table 2.

Footnote 2: Transverse impact parameter is defined as the distance of closest approach to the beam line, and longitudinal impact parameter is the value of \(z\) at the point of closest approach.

### Event selection

The calibration divides the events into two regions: a \(b\)-quark-enhanced region and a _light_-quark-enhanced region. The fraction of jets (for each truth flavour) is calculated using the unfiltered simulation in the two regions and the values are reported in Table 3.

The events in the \(b\)-quark-enhanced region are further split into two sub-regions: one where the probe jet passes the \(b\)-tagging requirement (_tagged_) and one where it fails it (_fail_). The events in the \(b\)-quark-enhanced region are used to extract the \(b\)-tagging efficiency scale factor defined in Eq. 3 via a profile likelihood. The events in the _light_-quark-enhanced region are used to derive the light-jet template.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Jet Selections & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV \\  & \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\) \\  & JVT Medium WP \\ \hline Muon Selections & \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\) \\  & \(|d_{0}|<2\) mm \\  & \(|z_{0}\cdot\sin\theta|\ _{\mathrm{i}}\) 4 mm \\  & Tight Quality \\ \hline Muon \(p_{T}\) Requirement & 5 GeV (if \(p_{T}^{Tet}<40\) GeV) \\  & 6 GeV (if \(40\) or \(p_{T}^{Jet}<90\) GeV) \\  & 8 GeV (if \(p_{T}^{Jet}>90\) GeV) \\ \hline Muon-Jet Matching & \(\Delta\,R<0.4\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\end{table}
Table 3: Fraction of jets (split into truth flavour) in \(b\)-quark-enhanced and _light_-quark-enhanced regions. The values are calculated using the unfiltered simulation. The statistical uncertainty is \(\leq 0.1\%\) for all the values.

\(b\)-quark-enhanced regionThe definition of this region relies on the fact that \(b\)-quarks are mostly produced in pairs. It follows that, if one jet in the event is identified as a \(b\)-jet, this enhances the probability that there is another \(b\)-jet in the event. To improve the \(b\)-jet purity of the jet sample used for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) calibration, the following procedure is applied:

* Require at least one jet passing the 85% OP of MV2.
* If multiple candidate \(b\)-tagged jets are present, the jet without a matched muon is preferred.
* If multiple jets without a matched muon are \(b\)-tagged, or if all \(b\)-tagged jets contain muons, select one jet from the candidates randomly.
* Perform the analysis using the remaining jets.

This enhancement procedure is applied to the data selected for the measurement and to the un-filtered MC used to obtain the simulation efficiency.

Light-quark-enhanced regionThe _light_-quark-enhanced region is defined in data events applying the same trigger selections and requiring that all the jets in the event must fail the 85% OP MV2. As a consequence, the events in the _light_-quark-enhanced region are statistically independent from those in the \(b\)_-quark-enhanced region_. This region is enriched in light-jets and it has low \(b\)-jet contamination. It is used to derive the light-jet template.

## 4 The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) method

To calculate the \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}\) for a given \(b\)-tagging algorithm using Eq. 2, two quantities need to be determined: \(N_{b}^{\mathrm{tagged}}\), the number of \(b\)-jets tagged by the algorithm, and \(N_{b}^{\mathrm{fail}}\), the number of \(b\)-jets failing the algorithm. In the simulation the number of \(b\)-jets passing or failing the \(b\)-tagging criteria can be retrieved using the truth record. In data, these quantities need to be measured independently for each \(b\)-tagging OP under study. A template fit method, using \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) as the discriminant, is applied to measure the normalisations of \(b\)-flavour jets and hence the \(b\)-tagging efficiency from the \(b\)-enhanced region data. Templates are derived for \(b\)-, \(c\)- and light jets. \(\tau\)-jets are not considered in this analysis since the cross-section for \(Z\to\tau\tau\) production is very small, and cascade \(b\)-decays through \(\tau\) (i.e. \(b\to\tau\to\mu\)) will not alter the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) template due to the small mass splitting between the \(\tau\) and \(\mu\). Because both the distributions in data and MC exhibit a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) dependence, templates are generated with the same \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) binning as the data.

### Template construction

Templates for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) spectrum of heavy flavour jets (\(b\)-, \(c\)-jets) are generated from muon-filtered MC samples, described in Section 2. The event selection criteria described in Section 3 are not applied: no dependency on the event selection is found in the heavy flavour templates, moreover, dropping the event selection reduces the statistical uncertainties.

\(b\)-jet templateThe \(b\)-jet template differs in each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) bin, as shown in Figure 2. The \(b\)-jet template is shown for three different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) ranges. For this reason templates for \(b\)-jets are derived exclusively for each jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range. The cause of the differences seen here is the relative amounts of direct (e.g \(B^{0}\to\mu^{\pm}+\nu_{\mu}+X\)) and cascade (e.g. \(B^{0}\to D^{0}+X\to\mu^{\pm}+\nu_{\mu}+X\)) decays. The fraction of cascade decays, as predicted by the MC simulation, goes from the 25% to 50% when the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) is increased from 30 to 200.

Figure 3 shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distribution for direct and cascade \(b\)-hadron decay. As expected the direct decay template has a harder spectrum than that for cascade decays, where the muon decays from a charm hadron. Therefore, in those jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges in which the direct decay component is bigger than the cascade component the resulting \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) template shows an harder spectrum.

There are two factors affecting the amount of direct or cascade decays in a given \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) range: the muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement and the missing energy due to semileptonic decays. The muons from direct semileptonic decays carry more energy therefore they are more likely to pass a given muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold. This enhances the fraction of direct \(b\)-hadron decays. On the other hand, the neutrino also carries more energy in the direct decay case and so the reconstructed jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) migrates more towards lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) compared with cascade \(b\)-hadron decays. The latter effect scales with the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). As a result, the lowest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) slice appears to have a harder \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) spectrum; this is because cascade decays in this slice are less likely to pass the muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement, so this bin contains mostly direct decays. In the higher jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges, the direct \(b\)-hadron decays lose more energy due to the energetic neutrinos, causing the direct \(b\)-hadron fraction to decrease. The \(b\)-jet template shapes also show small dependences on the applied MV2 \(b\)-tagging requirement, as seen in Figure 2. This is expected since MV2 is evaluated using boost and impact parameter displacement information that can affect the jet axis. The tagged (fail) \(b\)-jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distribution is used to determine the amount of \(b\)-jets in the tagged (fail) data sample.

\(c\)-jet templateSimilar to the bottom template, charm jet templates are derived exclusively in each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) bin. Small differences in the charm jet templates are observed as function of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\), primarily caused by statistical fluctuations. The direct \(c\) decays (e.g. \(D^{0}\to\pi^{-}+\mu^{+}+\nu_{\mu}\)) are harder than the cascade decays (e.g. \(D^{0}\to K^{-}/\pi^{-}\to\mu^{-}+X\)). The effect of direct-versus-cascade decays, however, is much smaller than for \(b\)-decays because charm cascade decays passing the selection are rare. In addition, the intermediate particles are kaons or pions that are not expected to decay in the inner detector, which result in a negligible cascade contribution to the charm template.

light-jet templateThe light-jet template is generated in a data-driven way for two reasons:

* the unfiltered simulation contains too few light-jets with spatially matched muons;
* the muon-filtered simulation has a low light-jet purity: this is an effect of the muon-in-jet filter applied at the generator level.

The light-jet template is extracted from data events in the light-quark-enhanced region. The heavy flavour (\(b\)- and \(c\)-jet) contamination in the light-jet sample is estimated from data within the fitting procedure.

In each bin \(i\) of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distribution the light-jet prediction \(N_{i}^{\mathrm{light}}\) is written as:

\[N_{i}^{\mathrm{light}}=N_{i}^{\mathrm{data-l-enhanced}}-k_{b}\cdot\hat{N_{i}^{ b}}-k_{\mathrm{non-}b}\cdot\hat{N_{i}^{c}}, \tag{4}\]

where \(N_{i}^{\mathrm{data-l-enhanced}}\) are the events from the light-quark-enhanced region, \(\hat{N_{i}^{b}}\) and \(\hat{N_{i}^{c}}\) are the \(b\)-jet and charm-jet contamination predictions from the MC and \(k_{b}\) and \(k_{\mathrm{non-}b}\) are the correction to the \(b\)-jets and non-\(b\)-jets normalisations.

Figure 3: Simulated distributions of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) for muons originating in direct (a) and cascade decay (b) of a bottom hadron, shown for three ranges of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\).

### Template fit

Figure 4 shows the normalised \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distributions in a single \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) bin for the three jet flavours. The \(b\)-template shows a harder \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) spectrum compared to the \(c\)- and light-jet templates.

Using the \(b\)-, \(c\)- and light-flavour templates, a binned profile likelihood fit is performed simultaneously to the tagged and fail data distributions as shown in Figure 6. The fit is performed independently for each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) bin.

Three free parameters are extracted from fit to the data:

* the \(b\)-tagging efficiency scale factor \(\mathrm{SF}_{b}\), defined in Equation 3,
* the \(b\)-jets normalisation factor \(k_{b}\),
* the \(c\)- and light-jets normalisation factor \(k_{\mathrm{non-}b}\).

The prediction in the tagged region is therefore expressed as

\[N_{\mathrm{tagged}}=\mathrm{SF}_{b}\cdot k_{b}\cdot N_{b}^{\mathrm{tagged}} +k_{\mathrm{non-}b}\cdot(N_{\mathrm{charm}}^{\mathrm{tagged}}+N_{\mathrm{ light}}^{\mathrm{tagged}}), \tag{5}\]

while the prediction in the fail region is

\[N_{\mathrm{fail}}=\frac{1-\mathrm{SF}_{b}\cdot\varepsilon_{b}^{\mathrm{MC}}} {1-\varepsilon_{b}^{\mathrm{MC}}}\cdot k_{b}\cdot N_{b}^{\mathrm{fail}}+k_{ \mathrm{non-}b}\cdot(N_{\mathrm{charm}}^{\mathrm{fail}}+N_{\mathrm{light}}^{ \mathrm{fail}}), \tag{6}\]

Figure 4: Muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) spectra for the \(b\)-, \(c\)- and light-jet templates in yellow, blue and red, respectively. The heavy flavour templates are generated from simulation while the light-jet template is extracted in a data-driven approach.

where \(N^{\text{tagged/fail}}\) is the number of events in the tagged/fail region and \(N^{\text{tagged/fail}}_{b}\), \(N^{\text{tagged/fail}}_{\text{charm}}\) and \(N^{\text{tagged/fail}}_{\text{light}}\) are the number of \(b\)-jets, \(c\)-jets and light-jets predicted by the simulation in the tagged/fail region.

The contribution of systematic uncertainties is added in the fit in the form of nuisance parameters \(\theta\) having a Gaussian distribution as described in Section 5. In this way, the extraction of the jet flavour yields accounts also for possible distortions in the templates due to systematic effects. Figure 5 shows a pre-fit plot for jets that passed and failed the \(b\)-tagging requirement where the fractions of the different jet flavours are fixed to the prediction from the simulation.

The fit to the \(b\)-tagged \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{rel}}\) distribution is shown in Figure 6 while the fit result for the fail region is shown in Figure 6. The overflow bin is not considered during fitting. The long tails in the \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{rel}}\) distribution in data cause the overflow bin to become the most statistically significant bin. This tail, however, is a reconstruction and detector effect. \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{rel}}\) values larger than half of the \(b\)-hadron mass are non-physical and these effects are not modelled accurately in MC. Therefore, the \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{rel}}\) range of the templates is confined to 0-2.5.

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

This calibration relies on simulated events in order to derive muon \(p_{\text{T}}^{\text{rel}}\) templates for the different jet flavours. It follows that any source of mis-modelling of the simulation might affect the resulting \(b\)-tagging

scale factors. Systematic uncertainties are classified into those pertaining to experimental effects and those related to the physics modelling of dijets events and heavy hadron production and decay. The experimental uncertainties include the contributions from the measurement of the identification and reconstruction of the physics objects. The physics modelling uncertainties are related to the theoretical framework used to produce the MC simulations. Most of the systematic variations are included in the profile likelihood-fit in the form of Gaussian distributed nuisance parameters. This technique opens to the possibility of constraining the uncertainties using data and exploiting the correlation with the other parameters in the fitting model. The only uncertainty which is not profiled is the one associated to the scale-factors extrapolation to the inclusive sample of b-jets. This uncertainty is described in the following and it is summed up in quadrature to the uncertainty derived by the profile-likelihood fit.

### Experimental uncertainties

Muon experimental uncertainties include momentum scale and resolution variations, together with variations of the reconstruction and identification efficiencies [21].

The Jet Energy Scale (JES) and its uncertainty are estimated both from the test-beam data, the collision data and the simulation. Data taken at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV are used to calibrate the residual uncertainty on the JES [18]. The measurements are combined and decorrelated into a set of 30 eigen-vectors that depend on the jet \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\). Those 30 NPs are split into various categories: 15 NPs are assessed from the in-situ calibration uncertainty, 4 NPs originate from the uncertainty on the pile-up components, 6 NPs comprise

the uncertainty on the \(\eta\) intercalibration, 2 NPs arise from the uncertainty on the flavour composition of the jets and the uncertainty on the response to different jet flavours (where the different flavours are quark- or gluon-generated jet), 1 NP originates from the uncertainty of the punch-through3 modelling and 1 NP describes the uncertainty of the high-\(p_{T}\) jets.

The Jet Energy Resolution (JER) is measured in data using events with \(Z\to\ell\ell\) or a photon, and an additional jet using in-situ techniques similar to Ref. [18]. The JER uncertainty is split into 8 NPs.

The efficiency of jets passing the Medium Working Point JVT selection differs between the simulated event and the observed data. To correct for these discrepancies, the simulated events are modified with scale factors obtained from the tag-and-probe measurements with \(Z\to\mu\mu\) and additional jets [19]. The JVT efficiency scale factors are varied within their uncertainties that originate from a 20% uncertainty on the estimation of the residual contamination from pile-up jets after pile-up suppression.

The mis-tag rate of \(c\)-jets was measured in a similar topology with an uncertainty that varies from 10% to 30% depending on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) and OP, see Ref. [22]. A normalisation uncertainty of 30% is therefore applied to the tagged \(c\)-jets in this work to constrain their contribution. Similarly, a normalisation uncertainty of 50% is applied to light-jets passing the \(b\)-tagging requirement.

### Modelling uncertainties

The physics modelling uncertainties accounted for in this analysis are grouped into those pertaining to muons and to jets.

The muons studied in this analysis originate both from direct \(b\to\mu+X\) decays and from cascade \(b\to c\to\mu+X\) decays. The branching fraction of \(b\)-hadrons decaying directly is measured to be \(BR(b\to\mu X)=(10.86\pm 0.16)\%\)[23, 4]: the percentage uncertainty on this measurement is then used to vary the _in-situ_ direct decay fraction entering in the bottom template. Both an up and down variations are performed: the difference in the results is taken as systematic uncertainty associated to the \(b\)-hadrons' decay.

The momentum of the muon in the \(b\)-hadron rest-frame \(p^{*}\) is a key distribution for this measurement. The \(p^{*}\) spectrum of truth muons in the \(b\)-hadron rest frame has been computed in the ATLAS simulation and compared to the Delphi[24] unfolded result (Figure 13 of [24]). The Delphi analysis measured the \(p^{*}\) spectrum from a sample of \(e\bar{e}\to b\bar{b}\) events where one of the \(b\)-hadrons produced decayed as \(b\to X\ell\bar{\nu}\). A discrepancy in the low \(p^{*}\) region is observed and it is attributed to tighter kinematical cuts applied to the muons and \(b\)-hadrons used to produce the ATLAS simulated spectrum. A minimal \(p_{T}\) requirement of 5 GeV is applied to the \(b\)-hadrons stored in the ATLAS simulation truth-record while a cut of 4 GeV is applied to the muons. On the other hand, the Delphi unfolded spectrum also includes softer \(b\)-hadrons and muons and it is therefore able to populate better the low \(p^{*}\) region. The minimal cut on the lepton momentum is set to 2.5 GeV and 3 GeV for muons and electrons, respectively. To estimate the impact of this limited knowledge, an uncertainty is built taking the Delphi distribution as a reference and varying the central value by the uncertainty on the Delphi measurement.

In order to reduce contributions from "fake" muons (for example, from decay-in-flight muons from pion or kaon decays), tight muon reconstruction quality criteria are required in the analysis. Despite this, mis-identified particles or decay-in-flight muons can still pass the selection. Due to the muon filter on the MC simulation, the number of fake muons is underestimated in the simulation. To estimate the effect of additional fake muons, an uncertainty is defined where the amount of fake muons is increased in the simulation by reweighting jets with a fake muon by a factor of two and propagating the impact to the resulting scale factors.

Energetic gluon decays may result in jets with two or more heavy flavour hadrons inside the jet cone due to gluon-splitting into quarks. Differently from the single b-quark jets, the gluon splitting jets have a different tagging efficiency, different probability to contain a muon, and a different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distribution. Therefore, their modelling has an impact on this measurement. The gluon splitting fraction increases with the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\). Moreover, increasing the fraction of gluon splitting fraction by a factor 2.5 provides a better description of the bottom template and overall better data-to-mc agreement. This suggests that the gluon splitting fraction is underestimated within the MC samples used. Although the optimal solution would be to estimate the gluon splitting component from data, it is not possible to build a gluon splitting component with a bin-by-bin statistical uncertainty comparable with the one of the other templates. Therefore, a conservative systematic uncertainty is imposed, where the gluon splitting fraction is scaled up and down by a factor of two in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) range of 20-70 GeV, while a factor of four is used in the rest of the range. The choice of the factor of four in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\geq 70\) GeV region is supported from studies showing that simulation underestimates the gluon splitting component more in this \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) region than in the soft \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) region. This calibration cuts off at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}=140\) GeV since the modelling of the gluon splitting in the simulation limits the accuracy of the measurement at high jet transverse momentum.

The measurement depends on the modelling of the final state particles in the \(b\)-hadron rest-frame. The differences in mass of the different \(b\)-hadrons (Table 4) can shape the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distribution if their abundance is not well modelled. Therefore, the fractions of hadrons (\(B^{0}\), \(B^{+}\), \(B_{s}\), \(b\)-baryons) produced during the fragmentation process is considered as systematic uncertainty in this work.

This modelling is limited by how precisely these fractions have been measured. The fragmentation fractions predicted by the ATLAS simulation are shown in Table 5 together with the HFAG averaged values [25]. A systematic uncertainty is evaluated in this measurement by comparing the \(b\)-jet template derived using the fragmentation fractions as predicted by the ATLAS simulation and after rescaling them to the HFAG values.

For the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) calibration it is a necessity to have a muon inside the jet cone, which is usually the case only for semileptonically decaying \(b\)-hadrons. The tagging efficiency on this sample, however, differs with respect to the inclusive \(b\)-tagging efficiency. This effect will cancel out in the calculation of the data-to-MC SFs as long as it is well modelled in the simulation. Data-to-MC b-tagging efficiency SFs are derived using the \(t\bar{t}\) tag-and-probe method on dileptonic \(t\bar{t}\) events. The SFs are derived as a function of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) separately for the case of a probe jet matched to a muon and the case of probe jets not matched to the muon. The ratio

between the data-to-mc b-tagging efficiency SF for the muon case and the non-muon case (SFs double ratio) is shown in Figure 7 for the 77% OP. The SFs double ratio is flat around one, demonstrating that there is no significant difference between data and simulation for the semileptonic and inclusive \(b\)-hadrons with respect to the precision reached by the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) calibration method. Moreover, the central value of the double SFs ratio is applied to the scale factor derived from the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) fit to rescale it to the inclusive \(b\)-hadron decays case. The uncertainty on the SFs double ratio is summed in quadrature to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) SF uncertainty in the results of this calibration.

## 6 Results

As discussed in Section 4, the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is computed by performing a template fit to the tagged and untagged \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) distributions. The procedure is repeated for all jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins and for four operating points for the algorithm MV2. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) dependent \(b\)-tagging efficiency \(\varepsilon_{b}\) in the selected data sample measured for the MV2 algorithm for the nominal efficiencies \(\varepsilon_{b}^{\mathrm{nom}}=85\%,77\%,70\%\), and \(60\%\) is shown in Figure 8. Data are shown in the black dots with uncertainty bands depicted in green, while the MC prediction is shown in red. Dividing the two efficiencies on the left results in the scale factors shown on the right with the respective uncertainties. It can be seen that the SFs are generally consistent with unity, although larger deviations are seen in low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) bins of the tightest (\(\varepsilon_{b}^{\mathrm{nom}}=60\%\) and \(70\%\)) operating points. The scale factor total uncertainty is dominated by the systematic component and it is smaller for the looser operating points. For a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) smaller than \(50\GeV\) the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty are the semileptonic-to-inclusive extrapolation, while for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) greater than \(50\GeV\) the dominant component stems from the modelling of gluon splitting to charm and bottom quarks.

In Figure 9 the \(b\)-tagging efficiency scale factors are compared to the likelihood-based calibration results derived using \(t\bar{t}\) events and documented in Ref. [5]. From this comparison, it appears the calibration method presented in this work is able to provide a smaller uncertainty in the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) region from \(20\) to \(40\GeV\) for all the OPs.

MC predictions are shown in red while the data is depicted in black dots. The statistic and systematic uncertainties are shown in the green error bands.

## 7 Conclusion

In this note the first measurement of \(b\)-tagging efficiencies with the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{rel}}\) method at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\)\(\mathrm{\,Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) was presented. Efficiencies have been measured for the MV2 algorithm for four working points. The results are presented as \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\)-dependent scale factors. The scale factors derived in the sample of semileptonic decays of \(b\)-hadrons are extrapolated to the inclusive decay case using a correction and an uncertainty derived from \(t\bar{t}\) events using a tag and probe method. The uncertainty on the scale factors is dominated by the systematic component. For a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) smaller than 50\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) the dominant sources of systematic uncertainty are the semileptonic-to-inclusive extrapolation, while for \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) greater than 50\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) the dominant component stems from the modelling of gluon splitting to charm and bottom quarks. The scale factor uncertainty is smaller for the looser operating points. The SFs are generally consistent with unity, although larger deviations are seen in low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) bins of the tightest (\(\varepsilon_{b}^{\mathrm{nom}}=60\%\) and \(70\%\)) operating points.
