**Abstract:**

Because of the concern about long-term silicon contamination of MDTs, we have tested the extent to which vacuum grease on O-rings is essential for producing gas tight muon chambers. We find that, for trial periods of up to six hours, a small amount of grease decreases the helium leak rate by only about a factor of 2-3. Thus, it appears that it may be acceptable to construct MDTs without vacuum grease on O-rings of endplugs. We also comment on the matter of checking MDTs for gas tightness.

**The Nature of the Studies:**

The "monitored' drift tubes (MDTs) used for tracking trajectories of muons through the toroids of the ATLAS detector are to be operated at a gas pressure of three atmospheres [1]. The fundamental element of the system is an aluminum tube that contains a centered anode wire, which is held in place (under tension) by endplugs lodged in at the ends of the tubes, and has locators positioned in the middle for the long tubes. In the current design, each endplug contains a groove for crimping the tube into proper position, and a channel that contains an O-ring that provides the gas seal. The operating gas, the high voltage (HV) for the anode, and the grounding of the tube, are provided through plastic feedthroughs embedded in the aluminum endplugs.

Using vacuum grease on O-rings can certainly provide a better gas seal for MDTs, and can ease the insertion of endplugs into their tubes. Nevertheless, silicon is known to accelerate deterioration of the performance of wire chambers, especially in high-radiation environments, as well as produce an increase in out-gassing time. In addition, the long-term deterioration of silicon grease also poses some concern. We have consequently attempted to determine whether foregoing the use of vacuum grease can be tolerated in the construction of MDTs. To this end, we constructed tubes with standard endplugs, but without their normal feedthroughs. The specific endplug design is sketched in Fig. 1. We compared the leak rate through the O-rings, using both greased and dry O-rings, as the tubes were pressurized with helium gas. (The 30 cm aluminum tubes, provided by the Menziken Co., were crimped to endplugs using a mechanical crimping technique developed previously at the Institute.)

The assembled tubes were checked for leaks using a helium sniffer, and then inserted into a steel-bellows vacuum chamber. (None of the tubes had initial leak rates that exceeded \(10^{-9}\) mbar-l/sec.) The more quantitative tests commenced with the insides of the tubes open to the atmosphere through the small inlets shown in Fig. 1. The chamber and the outside walls of the tubes were first pumped down with a Leybold UL500 helium leak detector. Typically, after about 10 minutes of pumping, the apparent leak rate stabilized at a value of \(<10^{-9}\) mbar-l/sec. Subsequently, after another 5 minutes of pumping, 1 bar (overpressure) of helium gas was admitted into the tube, and the leak rate through the O-rings was then mapped as a fuction of time. After 30 minutes, the helium overpressure was raised to 6 bars, and readings were continued for about an additional six hours.

To check the effect of introducing normal feedthroughs into the endplugs, we outfitted the endplugs of one tube with feedthroughs for HV and gas inlets, but not one for the anode wire. In fact, the gas outlet on the innermost endplug was closed with solder, and no holes were drilled for the anode wire in either endplug. Helium gas was admitted into this tube through the gas inlet on the outer endplug. In addition, to gauge the response of the UL500 to an unacceptably large leak, we prepared another tube (without the above feedthroughs) that was scratched in the region of the O-ring. Prior to the mechanical crimping of the tube about its endplugs, the tube was checked for leakage using a helium sniffer, and found to have a leak of approximately \(10^{-6}\) mbar-l/sec. This somewhat damaged tube was then put through a test procedure similar to that used for the standard tubes. Finally, we also investigated the response of the UL500 when, in the presence of a tube with feedthroughs (same as the ones described at the beginning of this paragraph), we introduced an external leak of \(\sim 5\times 10^{-8}\) mbar-l/sec directly into the cylidrical vacuum chamber. These last three tests were all performed using dry O-rings.

**Results and Conclusions:**

Figure 2 displays the time dependence of the observed leak rate for seven tubes (including those with feedthroughs) that did not have vacuum grease on the O-rings, and Fig. 3 shows the data for six tubes that used grease. The start time is defined by the time of pressurization of each tube with 1 bar (gauge) of helium. In general, about 10 minutes after pressurization, the leak rate for both dry and greased O-rings started exceeding \(10^{-9}\) mbar-l/sec. There were small but significant changes in the slope of the leak rate with time that we attribute to flexing and relaxation of the O-rings under pressure. The greatest changes were observed at the transition to 6 bars. At this junction, the leak rate often fell rather dramatically (more so for the case of greased O-rings), but then subsequently continued its initial rise with what appeared to be a displacement of \(10\)-\(15\) minutes in the time origin. An exception to this trend occurred for one of the tubes with greased O-rings, where, after the application of 6 bars of helium,

Figure 2: The helium leak rate as a function of time for seven tubes with dry O-rings. The two sets of data corresponding to measurements using tubes with feedthroughs, but without holes for the anode wire in their endplugs, are included in the figure. The tube with an inital leak rate of \(\sim 5\times 10^{-8}\) mbar-l/sec had an external leak of that order introduced directly into the vacuum chamber (see text). An expanded time scale is given in the lower part of the figure. One bar of helium was admitted at t=0, and six bars at t=30 minutes.

the leak rate dropped below \(10^{-9}\) mbar-l/sec, and remained at that level for about two hours. It rose subsequently to \(10^{-8}\) mbar-l/sec over the following two hours, and then jumped suddenly to \(>10^{-6}\) mbar-l/sec, and remained (although unstable) in the range of \((1.4-5.8)\times 10^{-6}\) mbar-l/sec. Such behavior may be attributable to our having used helium gas in the tests. Helium is known to penetrate and to be easily absorbed in vacuum grease, and therefore small adjustments in the position of the O-ring could affect the apparent leak rate. We do not expect such effects with normal operating gas.

For all tubes, the leak rate after six hours ranged between \(2.2\times 10^{-6}\) and \(5.0\times 10^{-6}\) mbar-l/sec, and between \(4.8\times 10^{-6}\) and \(8.4\times 10^{-6}\) mbar-l/sec, respectively, for the greased and dry O-rings. As we will see shortly, these rates reflect primarily the diffusion of helium through the O-rings, but must also reflect any leakage around them. Although the statistics are poor, there is clear evidence that the greased O-rings provide better gas tightness. Nevertheless, the observed difference using helium gas is not dramatic, and may prove to be negligible using the Ar/N\({}_{2}\)/C H\({}_{4}\) gas mixture currently favored by ATLAS [2].

The results for the two tubes that contained feedthroughs were given in Fig. 2. We see that, without an external leak, the response is comparable to that for tubes that had no feedthroughs. The final leak rate is on the high side of tubes without grease, but only a factor of four worse than found for the most gas-tight tubes (with greased O-rings) in Fig. 3. The response for the case of the small external leak appears to be just a superposition of a constant level (achieved prior to pressurization to 1 bar) and the typical increase of leak rate with time found in Fig. 2.

The results for the damaged tube (not shown) were totally different than for the other tubes. The leak rate grew rapidly with increasing helium pressure. At the start, it took longer (over an hour) to stabilize the readings of the UL500 to \(<10^{-9}\) mbar-l/sec, and the leak rate went up immediately to about \(4\times 10^{-6}\) mbar-l/sec as the helium overpressure was set to just 0.05 bar. The leak rate then remained stable at \((3-4)\times 10^{-6}\) mbar-l/sec for 30 minutes, and rose by an order of magnitude when the helium overpressure was raised at that time to 0.5 bar. Over the next hour, the leak rate fell by almost a factor of two. Then, upon another increase in helium pressure to an overpressure of 1 bar, the leak rate increased by another order of magnitude, and remained relatively stable at about \(2\times 10^{-4}\) mbar-l/sec.

In summary, the results from these studies indicate that the difference between using greased O-rings in MDTs rather than leaving them dry appears to have only a small effect on the helium leak rate of a tube after several hours of pressurization. Consequently, we expect no great gain from using vacuum grease on the O-rings. Also, because of their different response to helium, it should be relatively straightforward to identify damaged MDTs [3]. That is, since the apparent helium leak rate on tubes that are not gas tight increases immediately with the slightest application of helium gas, a simple test using a helium sniffer should suffice to determine if a tube is gas tight. We plan shortly to examine these same issues, and the matter of back-diffusion of gas contaminants into MDTs, using mass spectroscopy with the nominal operating gas.
