Introduction

Information concerning the radiation environments of the various Atlas detector systems can be found in their corresponding TDRs. However, design modifications, optimisations and engineering realities are continually being implemented and it is important to investigate the impact of any developments on the radiation backgrounds. Given in this note are the results of several studies in which the radiation environment of the inner detector has been simulated using the 1999 version of the Fluka program with an updated geometrical description of the Atlas experiment. The results are presented as particle fluences (n, p, \(\pi^{+-}\), \(\gamma\) and e\({}^{+-}\)), 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences and doses.

Changes that have been implemented in the Fluka geometry, with respect to previous Fluka simulations, include:

* Using a recent description of the beampipe, collimator and associated vacuum equipment according to technical co-ordination TDR. At present this is the baseline of the LHC vacuum group [1]. However, the design of the central inner detector beampipe is currently under study and is likely to change. In this note, a comparison is made to the (idealised) beampipe description according to the inner detector TDR.
* Using a recent description of the inner detector and services layout [2]. While the repositioning or the addition of Sct and Pixel layers is unlikely to influence the inner detector radiation environment significantly, changes in the amount of hydrogenous services material may influence the neutron and associated photon fields. However, it should be noted that details of the services have not yet been finalised so a degree of guesswork and approximations is unavoidable.
* Implementing the latest engineering details for shieldings JD, JT, IF, JN and the poly-moderators JM as defined in the technical co-ordination TDR. The poly-moderators are positioned in front of the end-cap calorimeters and reduce the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences via moderation of neutrons splashing back from the end-caps. However, the design of the poly-moderators is ongoing and simulations have been necessary as part of the optimisation process, the results of which are reported on in this note.
* The addition of LAr electronic crates between the barrel and end-cap calorimeters. 'Plugging' detector gaps with material will certainly change fluences in the muon chamber regions and may influence slightly the inner detector thermal neutron fluences.
* Changing the cavern concrete to a'standard' CERN concrete.
* The addition of a tungsten insert into the JD (end-cap toroid) shielding.

The latter two geometry changes are unlikely to have any effect on inner detector fluences and doses. In addition, detectors positioned close to interaction point, such as the Pixel system, will not be affected by experimental developments as their radiation environment is dominated by direct pions originating from the p-p interactions.

The Monte Carlo Simulations

### The Fluka program

The Fluka program is well-established in studies of cascades induced by high-energy particles in matter. Hadronic and electromagnetic cascades can be simulated from TeV energies down to keV energies (except neutrons which can be transported down to thermal energies). Hadron inelastic interactions are described in Fluka by three models depending on the energy. Above 4 GeV the dual parton model is used [3]. Between 2.5 GeV and 4 GeV a resonance production and decay model is employed [4], modified to take into account correlations among cascade particles and nuclear effects. Between 20 MeV and 2.5 GeV the pre-equilibrium-cascade model (PEANUT) [5] is used. All three models include evaporation and gamma deexcitation of the residual nucleus [6, 7]. Light residual nuclei are not evaporated but fragmented into a maximum of 6 bodies according to a Fermi break-up model. Fluka has been benchmarked against experimental data over a wide energy range for both hadronic and electromagnetic showers [8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13].

### The geometry

The geometry used to describe the Atlas experiment in the current simulations is an updated version (see Section 1) of that used in previous Fluka simulations by Ferrari and Sala. Some 900 regions are now used to define the inner detector, calorimeters, muon stations, shieldings, cavern, vacuum system and nearby LHC machine elements. Figure 1 shows a cross section of the inner detector region as defined by the present Fluka geometry.

### The simulations

Secondaries from p-p interactions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV have been generated using the latest version of the Dtujet minimum bias generator [14, 15]. Diffractive events are included giving an inelastic cross section of 80 mb and an average multiplicity of 123 particles per event. The Dtujet secondaries are transported and showered in Fluka down to the following energy cut-offs; 10 MeV for charged hadrons and muons, 30 keV for photons, 0.5 MeV for electrons, thermal energies for neutrons. For neutrons below 20 MeV a 72 energy-group cross section set is used in Fluka, prepared from the most recent evaluated data (JEF-1, JEF-2.2, ENDF/B-V1, JENDL-3, etc.).

### Fluence and dose scoring

Fluences for neutrons, protons, charged pions, electrons, positrons and gammas are scored at nine different boundary crossings in the inner detector, as indicated by the dotted lines in Figure 1. Doses are scored in the corresponding regions. The 1 MeV equivalent neutron fluences are obtained by convolving neutron, proton and pion fluence energy spectra with the corresponding energy dependent hardness factors for silicon [16]. 1 MeV equivalent neutron fluences are necessary for evaluating bulk damage in silicon.

Results

Examples of charged hadron, neutron and photon energy spectra are given in Figure 2 at four different inner detector locations (Pix-b2, Sct-b4, Sct-d9 and Trt-bo). The charged hadron spectra are dominated by pions originating from the p-p interaction, hence the corresponding harder spectrum for Sct-d9 (the mean energy increases with increasing rapidity). The similarities of the neutron spectra are consequences of 1) the neutrons originating predominately from hadronic interactions in the calorimeters (ie a distributed source) and 2) the neutrons typically undergoing many interactions before being captured. The large bin at low energy (1.0\(\times\)10\({}^{-14}\)\(\longrightarrow\) 4.14\(\times\)10\({}^{-10}\) GeV) corresponds to the thermal-neutron group of the 72-neutron groups ENEA data set used by Fluka for neutron transport below 20 MeV. The bulk of neutrons are thermal (typically greater than 30%). Finally, the photon spectra show some interesting features. The bulk of photons (\(>\) 95%) have energies less than 10 MeV and originate from neutron capture (and therefore correlate with thermal neutron fluences). The peaks at 511 keV and 2.2 MeV peaks correspond to positron annihilation and neutron capture on hydrogen respectively. The high energy photons are due to \(\pi^{\,0}\) decays originating from p-p interaction and therefore show similarities to the charged hadron spectra at energies greater than 10 MeV.

Particle energy spectra are useful for illustrating some general features of fluences in the inner detector. However, in practice, values of fluences integrated over energy are required. In addition, values are normalised assuming one operational year (10\({}^{7}\) s) of high luminosity running (10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)). It should be noted that for the first three years of LHC operation it is intended to run at luminosities of 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\).

### Baseline fluences and doses

Shown in Table 1 are the calculated fluences and doses at the various detector locations indicated in Figure 1. The high values of fluences and doses at the B-layer position highlights the challenges facing operation of such detectors at high luminosities. Note that because the first three years of LHC operation the luminosity will be 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) the corresponding values for fluences and doses will be a factor of ten lower than those given in Table 1.

A comparison with previous results is made in Table 2. The general trend has been an increase in fluences and doses. Neutron fluences (total and thermal) have increased typically \(>\) 10% in all locations. Charged hadron fluences have increased similarly in the Sct-d9 and TRT regions but elsewhere the increases are \(<\) 8% and therefore within the statistical uncertainties. This was anticipated for the Pixel and inner Sct detectors as the fluences are dominated by the secondaries from the p-p interaction. A similar pattern is seen for the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences where significant increases are observed in Sct-d9, Trt-wi and Trt-wo (23%, 28% and 18 % respectively) but the increases in the Pixel and inner Sct systems are small.

The most significant increase in fluences is seen for the photons in the Sct-d9 and Trt-wi regions, where factors of two increases are observed. However, the main contribution to this increase is due to the additional vacuum equipment being included in the simulations, a discussion of which follows in Section 3.3. Finally, doses have increased by 22 %, 23 % and 44 % in Pix-d5, Sct-d9 and Trt-wi respectively.

### Evaluation of the Inner Detector Moderators

#### 3.2.1 Current situation

Polyethylene moderators, doped with Lithium, are foreseen to moderate neutrons backsplashing from the end-cap calorimeter regions. In the current scenario, a poly-moderator consists of a 5 cm outer disc, attached to the face of an end-cap liquid-argon calorimeter, and a seperate inner piece (15 cm thick) covering the region in front of the FCAL (see Figure 1). Reducing the energies of the high-energy neutrons via moderation will have the effect of decreasing the corresponding silicon bulk damage. In addition, doping the polyethylene with Lithium has the advantage of reducing the thermal neutron component (due to the high thermal neutron capture cross section of \({}^{6}\)Li) without emitting capture-gammas. The poly-moderator material used in the 'baseline' simulations has a density of 1.0 g cm\({}^{-3}\) and consists of polyethylene (CH\({}_{2}\)) and Lithium-Flourine (the Lithium addition being 2.7% by weight in its natural isotopic composition).

In order to assess the usefulness of the poly-moderators in the current baseline design, a simulation was performed in which fluences and doses were obtained without them and compared. The results are given in Table 3. It can be seen that the effect of the poly-moderators is to reduce significantly the neutron fluences in all the inner detector regions. The most significant changes are in the forward regions (Stct-d9 and Trt-wi) where reduction factors of \(\sim\) 3 in total neutron fluences are seen. The corresponding effect on the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence is to obtain a factor \(\sim\) 2 reduction, hence the justification of using the polymoderators. Smaller but significant reductions in doses and \(\gamma\) and e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) fluences can be seen in some of the regions. A small increase in some of the charged hadron fluences may have occured (eg Sct-d9) but as the changes are similar to the statistical uncertainties (\(\sim\) 3%) these are difficult to quantify. In any case, the overall effect of using polymoderators is clearly beneficial.

#### 3.2.2 Doping with Lithium?

The doping of the moderators with Lithium will have consequences on both engineering and cost, when compared with a simpler polyethylene material. It is therefore important to justify such a material addition by evaluating the benefits, if any. Given in Table 4 are the results, again expressed as ratios, of comparing the baseline fluences and doses (poly-moderator with Lithium) to those obtained from simulations where the Lithium is removed (polyethylene with a density 0.94 g/cm\({}^{3}\)).

As expected, a significant decrease in neutrons, especially thermal neutrons, is observed when the poly-moderator contains Lithium. However, no improvement (ie reduction) in any of the other parameters is observed. In fact, the small increases in charged hadron and 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences values suggest that the situation is made worse. The explanation for this is presumably due to the increased density of the Li-F doped poly-moderator (1.0 g/cm\({}^{3}\)) when compared to simple CH\({}_{2}\) (0.94 g/cm\({}^{3}\)).

#### 3.2.3 Increasing the moderator volumes?

It has been shown that poly-moderators can reduce the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences by up to factors of two. However, if space is available to increase the moderator volume then it is interesting to see if this would further reduce the neutron and 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences significantly. In order to investigate this possibilty, a simulation was performed in which the baseline moderator thickness was increased by 5 cm for the outer disks and 10 cm for the inner parts. The results are given in Table 5 where it can be seen that gains are made, again in the forward regions, of up to 25%.

### Sensitivity to Vacuum Material

In the current beampipe design, NEG and Ion pumps are positioned in front of the FCAL. This differs significantly from what has previous been used in inner detector background simulations (typically a 1 mm thick Beryllium pipe the full length of the inner detector). In order to assess the impact of this material on the radiation background, a simulation was performed in which the NEG and ion pumps were removed. The results are given in Table 6.

The effect of including the vacuum equipment is typically to increase particle fluences significantly. The 1 MeV equivalent neutron fluences in the Sct-d9, Trt-wi and Trt-wo regions have increased by \(\sim\) 20%, but more noticable is the increase in \(\gamma\) and e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) rates (up to a factor of two for Trt-wi). A separate study on the effect of extra beampipe material (by Barberis et al. [17]) has concluded that such increases in fluences is unacceptable from the point of view of Trt hit rates. It should be noted, however, that an alternative method of providing the vacuum levels required is being investigated in which much less material is required. A separate evaluation of the beampipe design is also ongoing [18] and further changes will undoubtedly occur.

## 4 Conclusions

It has been shown that the total 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences in the inner detector have not increased drastically. Only in the forward regions (Sct-d9 and Trt-wi) are significant increases observed (\(\sim\) 25%). Therefore the situation remains unchanged for the Pixel and most of Sct systems, as expected due to most of the damage originating from pions coming from the p-p interactions. In addition, a value of 50% is assumed by the inner detector communities as the uncertainty in the predicted 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences.

The most striking increase is in photon fluences, especially in the forward regions (due to the addition of the vacuum-equipment). Figure 2 shows that the spectra peaks at around 100 keV, therefore the consequences for the Sct and Trt hit rates would have to be evaluated in order to quantify the results.

It should be noted that most of the increases in the radiation environment have been caused by adding the vacuum-equipment in front of the FCAL. However, as mentioned in Section 3, the inner detector beampipe and associated vacuum-equipment is being reevaluated and is likely to change. It is clear that there will be more material than used in previous simulations but, with careful design, the situation should improve when compared to the current simulations.

The addition of lithium to the poly-moderator material does not significantly reduce 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences or doses in the inner detector regions, suggesting it is unnecessary. However, thermal neutron fluences are reduced significantly and the inner detector communities need to decide if this alone justifies the inclusion of Lithium. For example, a study on the damage caused by thermal neutrons to Atlas Sct detectors [19] concluded that thermal neutrons had no impact on the performance of the Sct modules.

Finally, the addition of extra poly-moderator material would reduce further the 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluences and is recommended should the possibilty arise.
