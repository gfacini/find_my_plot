# Study of higher-order QCD corrections in the gg\(\to\)H\(\to\)VV process

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Several studies have shown that the high-mass off-peak regions in the \(H\to ZZ\) and \(H\to WW\) channels above the VV mass threshold (\(V=W,Z\)) have sensitivity to off-shell Higgs production and interference effects. This feature can be exploited to characterize the Higgs boson off-shell signal strength and its associated couplings. This note reports on the treatment of the QCD-related systematic uncertainties for the extraction of the off-shell Higgs boson signal strength related to the comparison of different Monte Carlo modeling for the gg-initiated processes, gg\(\to\) (\(H^{*}\)) \(\to\)VV. Higher-order QCD corrections to the transverse momentum \(p_{\rm T}\) and the rapidity y of the VV system are studied using Sherpa+OpenLoops, which includes matrix-element calculations for the first hard jet emission. A difference of the order of 20% in the ratio of the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the VV system in the relevant kinematic region is observed when comparing the LO generators with parton shower to Sherpa+OpenLoops, while the difference in the rapidity of the VV system is found to be small.

## 1 Introduction

Measurements of the ZZ and WW final states in the high mass can be used to extract the off-shell coupling strength of the Higgs boson [1; 2; 3]. The analyses [4; 5] present constraints on the off-shell Higgs boson event yields normalized to the Standard Model prediction (signal strength) in the ZZ\(\rightarrow\)4\(\ell\), ZZ\(\rightarrow\)2\(\ell\)2\(\nu\) and WW\(\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu\) channels. In the ATLAS analysis [5], using the CLs method, the observed 95% confidence level (CL) upper limit on the off-shell signal strength is in the range 5.1-8.6, with an expected range of 6.7-11.0. This range is determined by varying the unknown gg\(\rightarrow\)ZZ and gg\(\rightarrow\) WW background K-factor from higher-order QCD corrections between half and twice the value of the evaluated signal K-factor. Under the assumption that the Higgs boson couplings are independent of the energy scale of the Higgs production, a combination of the off-shell constraint with the on-shell Higgs peak measurement yields an observed (expected) 95% CL upper limit the Higgs total width normalized to the one of the Standard Model, i.e. \(\Gamma_{\rm H}/\Gamma_{\rm SM}\), in the range 4.5-7.5 (6.5-11.2) employing the same variations of the background K-factor. Assuming that the unknown gg\(\rightarrow\)VV background K-factor is equal to the signal K-factor, this translates into an observed (expected) 95% CL upper limit on the Higgs boson total width of 22.7 (33.0) MeV.

The analysis [5] employed to extract the off-shell signal strength in the high mass (\(m_{4\ell}>\)220 GeV) ZZ\(\rightarrow\)4\(\ell\), ZZ\(\rightarrow\)2\(\ell\)2\(\nu\) and WW\(\rightarrow\ell\nu\ell\nu\) final states, is based on two Monte Carlo simulations for gg-initiated processes, namely gg2VV [6] and MCFM [3]. The dominant gg-initiated processes used in the analysis [5] are listed below:

1. gg\(\to H\rightarrow\) ZZ, the signal (S) comprising both the on-shell peak at \(m_{\rm H}=\)125.5 GeV and the off-shell region where the Higgs boson acts as a propagator;
2. gg\(\rightarrow\) ZZ, the continuum background (B);
3. gg\(\rightarrow\) (\(H^{*}\)) \(\rightarrow\) ZZ, the signal, continuum background and interference contribution, labelled as SBI in what follows.

However, only Lowest-Order (LO) in QCD Monte Carlo simulations are available, namely gg2VV and MCFM with Pythia8 [7] showering. For this reason, mass-dependent K-factors to higher order accuracy are needed to achieve a better precision.

* For the signal process, higher order QCD corrections are computed: LO to Next-to-Next-to-Leading-Order (NNLO) K-factors are calculated as a function of the diboson invariant mass \(m_{\rm ZZ}\).
* For the background process, the full K-factor from LO to NNLO accuracy is currently not available.

Different approaches exploited in order to take into account the absence of higher order QCD corrections in gg\(\rightarrow\) (\(H^{*}\)) \(\rightarrow\)VV final states (it is to note that Next-to-Leading Order, NLO, gg\(\rightarrow\)ZZ QCD calculation has been recently performed [8]) and the systematic uncertainties associated to these processes will be detailed in the following Sections.

## 2 Parton Shower Scheme Dependence

Given that no higher order matrix element calculations are available for the \(gg\)-initiated processes, the only way to simulate QCD radiation is through the parton shower. However, as the generation is done at LO inQCD, there is no clear prescription to evaluate the systematic uncertainties on the QCD scale. According to the maximum jet \(p_{\rm T}\) scale emission characterizing the parton showers, two different configurations [9] are exploited, the _power shower_ (the emission is allowed up to the kinematical limit) and the _wimpy shower_ (the shower is started at the value of the factorization or the renormalization scale). Pythia8 is tuned as default with the power shower option. The comparison is carried out involving the following parton shower schemes at generator level:

* Pythia8 power shower including a matrix element correction on the first jet emission such that information coming from the exact matrix element calculation is exploited for the hardest jet in the shower [7];
* Pythia8 power shower without a matrix element correction;
* Pythia8 wimpy shower without a matrix element correction;
* Herwig6.5 [10] in combination with Jimmy.

The items above are finally compared to high-mass Powheg-Box [11] NLO gg\(\to H\to\) ZZ event sample with a Higgs boson mass generated with \(m_{\rm H}\)=380 GeV, chosen around the most sensitive off-shell invariant mass region for the analysis. The normalized \(p_{\rm T}\)(ZZ) distributions, detailed in Figure 1 as reported in Ref. [9] for the sample above in the text are plotted in the same high ZZ mass range (345\(<m_{4\ell}<\)415) GeV in order to ensure a compatible mass of the hard interaction system. As the default samples are generated with the LO gg\(\to\) (\(H^{*}\)) \(\to\)ZZ matrix element with Pythia8 using the power shower parton shower option and this sample shows the largest deviation from Powheg, the full difference of the order of 10% is taken as a systematic uncertainty in the ATLAS analysis as in [5].

Figure 1: Distribution of \(p_{\rm T}\)(ZZ) comparing the NLO generator Powheg showered with Pythia8, the LO generator gg2VV + Pythia (power or wimpy shower), the LO generator gg2VV showered with Jimmy+Herwig. All samples are restricted to the range (345\(<m_{4\ell}<\)415) GeV.

## 3 Higher order QCD corrections to the transverse momentum and the rapidity of the ZZ system

Higher order QCD corrections for the gg\(\to\) ZZ processes are studied using the Sherpa+OpenLoops [12, 13] generator that contains the LO gg\(\to\)ZZ+1-jet matrix element and merges this with the LO gg\(\to\)ZZ+ 0-jet matrix element. For the gg\(\to H\to\) ZZ signal contribution with \(m_{\rm H}\)=380 GeV (on-shell signal), the Powheg generator reweighted (as a function of \(p_{\rm T}\)) to the HRes2.1 prediction [14] to reach NNLO+NNLL accuracy is also used. Figures 2, 3 and 4 include validation distributions of various comparisons of the variables of interest, namely the transverse momentum, \(p_{\rm T}\)(ZZ), and the rapidity, Y(ZZ), of the ZZ system in both on-shell and off-shell mass regions using Powheg+Pythia8, Sherpa+OpenLoops and gg2VV+Pythia8 generators using kinematic variables computed at truth level. The list of cuts applied in the generation level can be found below (\(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}\) is the transverse momentum of each lepton in the final state, \(|\eta^{\ell}|\) represents its rapidity 1 while \(m_{\rm Z1}\) is the Z boson mass closest to the Z peak, being \(m_{\rm Z2}\) the mass of the second lepton pair):

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector, and the z-axis along the beam line. The x-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the y-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r,\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam line. Observables labelled _transverse_ are projected into the x–y plane. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta\)=–ln tan(\(\frac{\theta}{2}\)).

* \(m_{4\ell}>\)100 GeV;
* \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell}>\)3 GeV;
* \(|\eta^{\ell}|<\)2.8;
* \(m_{\rm Z1,ZZ}>\) 4 GeV.

Additional selection criteria are applied on the final state quadruplet (the leptons in the quadruplet are ordered in transverse momentum and denoted with the superscript \(\ell\) in what follows) in the Monte Carlo samples in such a way to mimic the standard selection reported in Ref. [5], namely:

* \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell 1}>\)20 GeV, \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell 2}>\)15 GeV, \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell 3}>\)10 GeV, \(p_{\rm T}^{\ell 4}>\)5 (6) GeV for muons (electrons);
* \(|\eta^{\ell}|<\)2.5;
* (50\(<m_{\rm Z1}<\)106) GeV;
* if \(m_{4\ell}<\)140 GeV \(\to m_{\rm Z2}>\)12 GeV, if 140\(<m_{4\ell}<\)190 GeV \(\to m_{\rm Z2}>\)0.76-(\(m_{4\ell}\)-140)+12 GeV, if \(m_{4\ell}>\)190 GeV \(\to m_{\rm Z2}>\)50 GeV.

The errors bars in Figures 2, 3 and 4 indicate the statistical uncertainty related to the finite Monte Carlo statistics only. The systematic uncertainties, when applicable, are drawn as shaded boxes, extracted from scale variations on Sherpa+OpenLoops and HRes2.1 as described in the following Section 3.1. The systematic uncertainties from the HRes2.1 are applicable here as the Powheg generator is directly reweighted to the HRes2.1 prediction. The results and the distributions reported in the following Figures refer to Monte Carlo samples generated at a collision energy \(\sqrt{s}\)=8 TeV.

As highlighted in Figure 2 (a) for what concerns the on-shell and Figure 2 (b) for the off-shell, the lack of higher QCD calculations in gg2VV results in different \(p_{\rm T}\) spectra (order of 20% in the relevant kinematic region) compared to the higher order Powheg and Sherpa+OpenLoops Monte Carlo.

### Scale variations on the gg-initiated samples

In order to evaluate the systematic effects on the uncertainties on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) in the ZZ frame, the procedure is applied by varying the renormalisation scale (\(\mu_{\mathrm{R}}\)), the factorization scale (\(\mu_{\mathrm{F}}\)), the resummation scale (\(\mu_{\mathrm{Q}}\)) and the resummation scale related to the bottom quark mass (\(\mu_{\mathrm{B}}\)).

The impact of the PDF uncertainties is also evaluated: the nominal PDF set, CT10 [15], applied on the Powheg signal sample at \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=125.5 GeV are compared with MSTW2008 [16] and with NNPDF2.3 [17] in bins of ZZ-transverse momentum and rapidity. Its impact is found to be below 3%. The Monte Carlo simulations employed for these studies and the full scheme of scale variations applied to these samples are listed in Table 1. Assuming that the resummation scales (\(\mu_{\mathrm{Q}}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{B}}\)) variations are independent of the normalization and factorization scales (\(\mu_{\mathrm{R}}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{F}}\)), we fix the vector pair (\(\mu_{\mathrm{R}}\), \(\mu_{\mathrm{F}}\)) while varying \(\mu_{\mathrm{Q}}\) or \(\mu_{\mathrm{B}}\). Similarly we fix the resummation scales, \(\mu_{\mathrm{Q}}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{B}}\), while varying \(\mu_{\mathrm{R}}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{F}}\). Following the usual prescriptions, the nominal scale of the process is set to \(m_{\mathrm{ZZ}}/2\) while the nominal value for the resummation scale related to the bottom mass is set to \(m_{\mathrm{b}}\) and the Powheg nominal values for renormalisation and factorization scales are set to \(m_{\mathrm{ZZ}}\).

Figure 5 shows the shape-only variations on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)(ZZ) and Y(ZZ) for a high mass \(m_{\mathrm{H}}\)=380 GeV gg\(\to H\to\mathrm{ZZ}\) signal process, produced by QCD scale variations evaluated with the HRes2.1 Monte Carlo generator. The scale variations on the rapidity in Figure 5 (b) can be neglected since they are much smaller than those of the transverse momentum, Figure 5 (a). Figure 6 shows the variation of the signal process (a) and the background processes on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)(ZZ) created with the Sherpa+OpenLoops Monte Carlo sample. The envelope of these independent variations on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)(ZZ) is calculated as the maximal up and down contribution for each \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin for the HRes2.1 case as well as for Sherpa signal and background. Since the contribution of the resummation scale is dominant, a first envelope encompassing renormalisation and factorization scales summed it in quadrature with the envelope extracted from the resummation scale provides enough accuracy for this study. Note that the Sherpa variations enclose the variations of HRes2.1 because Sherpa does not contain the full NLO calculations, hence its variations are larger than the typical scales of HRes2.1.The systematic uncertainties reported in Ref. [5] associated with the Sherpa-based reweighting

in \(p_{\rm T}\) of the VV system are assessed by varying the relevant scales in Sherpa: the larger in value between the scale variations in Sherpa and 50% of the difference between Sherpa and gg2VV+Pythia is assigned as the systematic uncertainty. This conservative approach is chosen to consider potential uncertainties not accounted for by the scale variations. The impact of the PDF uncertainties is found to be negligible.

## 4 Summary

Higher-order QCD corrections to the transverse momentum \(p_{\rm T}\) and the rapidity y of the VV system are studied using Sherpa+OpenLoops, which includes matrix-element calculations for the first hard jet emission. A difference of order 20% in the ratio of the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the VV system in the relevant kinematic region is observed when comparing the LO generators with parton shower to Sherpa+OpenLoops, while the difference in the rapidity y of the VV system is small. This difference in the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the VV system can modify the kinematic observables used in the analyses, leading to variations in both the kinematic shapes and acceptance. To account for these effects, the LO generators can be reweighted to Sherpa+OpenLoops
