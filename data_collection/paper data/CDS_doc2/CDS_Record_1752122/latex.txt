**A Leakage Current-based Measurement of the Radiation Damage**

**in the ATLAS Pixel Detector**

The ATLAS Collaboration

A measurement has been made of the radiation damage incurred by the ATLAS pixel detector barrel silicon modules from the beginning of operations through the end of 2012. This translates to hadronic fluence received over the full period of operation at energies up to and including \(8\TeV\). The measurement is based on a per-module measurement of the silicon sensor leakage current. The results are presented as a function of integrated luminosity and compared to predictions by the Hamburg Model. This information can be used to predict limits on the lifetime of the pixel detector due to current, for various operating scenarios.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS pixel detector [1] is constructed from planar silicon pixel modules arranged in a barrel and disk geometry. It is centered on the interaction point at the heart of the ATLAS Detector [2] at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). A linear relationship between leakage current and a hadronic particle fluence is expected to apply to the pixel silicon sensors and is given by

\[\Delta I=\alpha\cdot\Phi_{\rm eq}\cdot V, \tag{1}\]

where \(\Delta I\) is the difference in leakage current at fluence \(\Phi_{\rm eq}\) relative to the value before irradiation of the physical volume \(V\), and \(\alpha\) is the current-related damage coefficient [3]. The goal of this study is to measure the leakage currents of a representative sample of sensors in the ATLAS pixel detector in order to monitor and understand the sensor damage resulting from increasing radiation dose. The measured results are compared to predictions based on the Hamburg Model [4] in which reverse-bias current is generated by the introduction of defect levels in the band gap due to non-ionizing energy loss (NIEL) of through-going particles. The defects migrate and recombine through several processes that result in both short-term beneficial annealing (which reduces the current) and long-term anti-annealing (which increases the current even in the absence of further radiation). The model can be calibrated to the data to predict the lifetime of the sensors and the pixel detector as a whole for various operating scenarios.

The detector is instrumented as three barrels, specifically the Layer-0 at \(r=50.5\,\)mm, the Layer-1 at \(r=88.5\,\)mm, and the Layer-2 at \(r=122.5\,\)mm, comprising in total 1456 modules. The endcap areas are instrumented with three disks located at \(z=\pm 495\,\)mm, \(\pm 580\,\)mm and \(\pm 650\,\)mm in each of the forward and backward regions, comprising an additional 288 modules. The pixel detector and the other elements of the ATLAS inner detector span a pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<2.5\)1. A cut-away view of the ATLAS pixel detector is shown in Figure 1. Some parameters for the barrel region of the pixel detector system are summarized in Table 1. Modules are mounted on mechanical/cooling supports, called staves, in the barrel region. Thirteen modules are mounted on a stave and the stave layout is identical for all layers. The temperature was maintained stable by an evaporative cooling system. There were a few exceptions when the temperature rose to ambient due to cooling interruptions and calibration scans.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

Each pixel sensor is fabricated on \(252.5\pm 2.8\,\mu\)m thick n-type bulk. The bulk contains n\({}^{+}\) implants on the read-out side and the p-n junction on the back side. For each sensor tile, the 47232 pixel implants are arranged in 144 columns and 328 rows. In 128 columns, 41984 (88.9 %) p

of \(382.5\times 30\)\(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) with a pitch corresponding to \(400\times 50\)\(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\), and in 16 columns, 5248 (11.1 %) pixels have implant sizes of \(582.5\times 30\)\(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) corresponding to a pitch of \(600\times 50\)\(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\). In each column eight pairs of pixel implants, located near the center lines, are ganged to a common read-out, resulting in 320 independent read-out rows or 46080 pixel read-out channels. The \(\sim\) 1.7 m\({}^{2}\) sensitive area of the ATLAS pixel detector is covered with 1744 identical modules. Each module has an active surface of \(6.08\times 1.64\) cm\({}^{2}\). The details of the pixel sensor geometry and layout can be found in [1].

The radiation field in the region of the detector has been predicted with the aid of a FLUKA software package [5]. The FLUKA transport code to cascade the particles through the ATLAS detector material has been used together with PYTHIA 6.2 or PHOJET generating proton-proton minimum-bias events as an input to FLUKA [1].

We assume that the dominant radiation damage type is displacement defects in the bulk of the pixel sensor, initiated by hadronic species and caused by NIEL. Surface ionization is neglected in this treatment. Charged pions are expected to dominate the bulk damage for the radii covered by the pixel detector. Albedo neutrons originating in the outer ATLAS detectors also contribute. The resulting displacement defects increase the reverse leakage current, degrade the charge collection efficiency, and change the effective doping concentration which directly determines the depletion voltage. We define the effective fluence \(\Phi_{\text{eq}}\) as the number of particles causing damage equivalent to that of 1MeV neutrons traversing

## 2 Measured Quantities

The parameter \(\alpha\) in Equation 1 has been measured under a variety of conditions, for example [3]. The linear form applies to the leakage currents drawn by sensors past their beneficial annealing periods. At the beginning of data-taking and during beneficial annealing periods, the sensors draw currents at levels comparable to dark currents; thus any hardware implementations for leakage current measurement should provide access to the lowest current range possible.

The reverse bulk generation current depends on the sensor temperature \(T\). The current measurements \(I(T)\) are normalized to the reference temperature \(T_{R}\) (0\({}^{\circ}\)C) with

\[I(T)=I(T_{R})/R(T),\,\,\,\mbox{where}\,\,\,R(T)=(T_{R}/T)^{2}\cdot\exp\left(- \frac{E_{g}}{2k_{B}}(1/T_{R}-1/T)\right), \tag{2}\]

where \(E_{g}=1.21\) eV is the energy of the silicon band gap, \(k_{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant, and \(T\,\mbox{and}\,T_{R}\) are measured in K [6].

The mean pixel module temperature for all barrel pixel modules is shown versus time in Figure 2. There were a few exceptions when the temperature rose to ambient due to cooling interruptions and calibration scans. Temperature is read out from every module continuously and averaged over 30-minute intervals. Temperature data (as well as other slow control data) are committed into the ATLAS Detector Control System (DCS) database.

## 3 The ATLAS Current Measurement Subsystem

The ATLAS High Voltage Patch Panel 4 (HVP4) serves as a fan-out point for the bias voltages delivered by Type II boards from Iseg [7] high voltage power supplies to the pixel modules. The leakage current is monitored at the pixel module granularity level by a Current Measurement Board (CMB) system. A

Figure 2: The mean temperature (\({}^{\circ}\)C) of all barrel pixel modules, versus time (days).

CMB is mounted on every Type II fan-out board. The bias voltage to the sensors is provided by the Iseg channels.

In the present data-taking era, when the radiation damage of the sensors is relatively low, 6 or 7 pixel modules are fed by one Iseg power supply channel. At some point after inversion of the sensors, before the current drawn by 6 or 7 pixel modules reaches the Iseg limit, power supplies can be added until the system provides one Iseg power supply channel per pair of pixel modules. The CMB system allows simultaneous measurement of the leakage currents in 4 pixel modules in the current range from \(0.04\,\mu\)A to \(2\,\)mA (a dynamic range of approximately 50000) with a precision of better than \(20\,\%\) per module. ATLAS uses 21 CMBs in Layer-0, 16 in Layer-1, and 16 in Layer-2. The analog current measurements are digitized by the 64-channel ATLAS Embedded Local Monitoring (ELMB) board and sent via Controller Area Network (CAN) bus to the DCS database (see [1] for details on the Type II, ELMB, CAN, and DCS). The CMB circuit is a current to frequency converter optically coupled to a frequency to voltage converter as shown in Figure 3. Each CMB holds 4 current measurement circuits and provides the current measurement for 4 channels, which are pixel modules. Two similar circuits with different gains are allocated per channel. The channels are isolated from each other and from the pixel module readout system. Some details of the design were partly chosen for economy.

For each pixel module, the leakage current range \([10^{-8}-10^{-5}]\) A is covered by the high-gain channel, and the range \([10^{-6}-2\cdot 10^{-3}]\,\)A is covered by the low-gain channel. The output CMB voltage range is defined by one of five available ELMB input voltage ranges, which are \([0-25]\,\)mV, \([0-100]\,\)mV, \([0-1]\,\)V, \([0-2.5]\,\)V, and \([0-5]\,\)V. The output range \([0-5]\,\)V is necessary to comply with the specifications of the digital ELMB board. The 16-bit ADC of the ELMB provides a resolution of (ELMB range)/\((2^{16}-1)\). The range \([0-1]\,\)V was used for data taken through 2011;

## 6 Lifetime Estimate

The temperature-corrected current readings per module can be extrapolated to predict the amount of current the pixel modules will draw after a certain integrated luminosity has been collected with the ATLAS pixel detector. As leakage current can lead to excessive power and thermal runaway, limits on the module lifetime _due to current_ can be determined from the limit on the bias voltage that can be applied. A single Iseg power supply channel can sustain a maximum current of \(\lesssim\)4000 \(\mu\)A for two modules. There are other consequences of radiation-induced leakage current upon module lifetime, including the noise, bias, and threshold limitations of the front end chips as well as the finite capacity of the cooling system; while important, these are not treated here.

We extrapolate the present rate of current increase with integrated luminosity, assuming optimistically that in future years modules will be exposed for 10 days to 20\({}^{\circ}\)C and otherwise maintained at \(-13^{\circ}\)C. The model assumes that the bias voltage is raised throughout LHC operation as needed to keep the bulk fully depleted, until a maximum allowed voltage of 600 V is reached. Only the effects of proton runs are considered. Figure 10, shows the implied leakage current per module versus date and versus integrated

luminosity for Layer-0 in this scenario. This extrapolation predicts, for Layer-0, a leakage current of about 500 \(\mu\)A per module (of thickness 250 \(\mu\)m) after accumulation of about 450 fb\({}^{-1}\) of delivered luminosity, which corresponds to January 2024 in the scenario proposed here.

## 7 Summary and Prospects

We have described the principles of radiation damage monitoring using the current measurements provided by the circuits of the ATLAS pixel high voltage delivery system. We have observed radiation damage in the ATLAS pixel detector with characteristics in agreement with the Hamburg Model. The dependence of the leakage current upon the integrated luminosity has been presented. Linear behavior of the response has been observed. The current distribution in azimuthal quadrants is symmetric as expected. The shape of the current distribution in pseudorapidity is in agreement with a fluence calculation based on FLUKA Monte Carlo. Extrapolation of leakage current with time predicts survival of Layer-0 up to 450 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. This current monitoring system will be expanded to encompass pixel disk modules in Run 2 and beyond.
