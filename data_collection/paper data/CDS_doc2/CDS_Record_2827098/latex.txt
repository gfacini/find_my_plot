## Summary plots for beyond Standard Model Higgs boson benchmarks for direct and indirect searches

The ATLAS Collaboration

This note presents an update of the plots that summarize the interpretations of various searches for additional Higgs bosons beyond the Standard Model, as well as the Higgs boson coupling combination, in the hMSSM and the 2HDM. This version supersedes ATL-PHYS-PUB-2021-030.

## 1 Summary

This note presents an update of the plots that summarize the interpretations of various searches for additional Higgs bosons beyond the Standard Model, as well as the indirect constraints from measurements of the SM Higgs boson's couplings, in the hMSSM. A previous version can be found in Ref. [1], which is superseded by this document. In addition an interpretation of some searches for additional Higgs bosons beyond the Standard Model is shown in the context of type-I two-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM).

In the hMSSM interpretation, the following updates are implemented with respect to the previous version:

* Results for the \(H\to ZZ\), \(A\to Zh\) and \(H\to hh\) channels are updated.
* The search for \(ttH\) with \(H/A\to tt\) is introduced in the summary plot for the first time.

## 2 hMSSM

The hMSSM is a benchmark scenario for the MSSM Higgs sector, which is based on certain approximations on the various supersymmetric degrees of freedom. It is presented in Refs. [2; 3; 4]. A discussion of the approximations of this scenario can be found in Ref. [5].

Figures 1-4 show the expected and/or observed limits at 95% confidence-level (CL) in the hMSSM, using different axis ranges, for several analyses based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the ATLAS experiment at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV. The integrated luminosity considered in each of the searches listed below is quoted between parentheses.

* "Search for heavy Higgs bosons decaying into two tau leptons with the ATLAS detector using \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV" [6] (139 fb\({}^{-1}\)).
* "Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying via \(H^{\pm}\to\tau^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) in the \(\tau\)+jets and \(\tau\)+lepton final states with 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data recorded at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS experiment" [7] (36.1 fb).
* "Search for charged Higgs bosons decaying into top and bottom quarks at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector" [8] (139 fb\({}^{-1}\)).
* "Search for heavy neutral Higgs bosons produced in association with \(b\)-quarks and decaying to \(b\)-quarks at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector" [9] (27.8 fb\({}^{-1}\)).
* "Search for heavy resonances decaying into a pair of \(Z\) bosons in the \(l^{+}l^{-}l^{\prime+}l^{\prime-}\) and \(l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) final states using 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) of collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector" [10] (139 fb\({}^{-1}\)).
* "Search for heavy resonances decaying into a \(Z\) or \(W\) boson and a Higgs boson in final states with leptons and \(b\)-jets in 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector" [11] (139 fb\({}^{-1}\)).
* "Search for heavy resonances decaying into \(WW\) in the \(e\nu\mu\nu\) final state in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector" [12] (36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\)).
* "Combination of searches for non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production in the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) decay channels using \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector" [13] (126-139 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

* "Combined measurements of Higgs boson production and decay using up to 80 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV collected with the ATLAS experiment" [14] (36.1-79.8 fb\({}^{-1}\)).
* "Search for \(t\bar{t}H/A\to t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) production in the multilepton final state in proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with the ATLAS detector" [15] (139 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

For the search for Higgs boson pairs, the experimental analysis of Ref. [13] considers the combination of three channels: \(bbbb\), \(bb\tau\tau\), and \(bb\gamma\gamma\). In the mass range shown here, the \(bb\gamma\gamma\) resolution is such that the experimental limit applies for width of \(H\) boson up to about 2%. The combination of all three channels is used when this constraint is valid. For larger width the two channel (\(bbbb\) and \(bb\tau\tau\)) combination is used.

## 3 2hdm

This section presents a set of plots that summarize the interpretations of various searches for additional Higgs bosons beyond the Standard Model in the type-I 2HDM [25]. The 2HDM is an extension of the Standard Model Higgs sector that includes an additional weak isospin doublet of Higgs boson fields, which leads to five Higgs bosons after electroweak symmetry breaking. These are denoted assuming CP-conservation as \(A\), \(H\), \(h\) and \(H^{\pm}\). The type-I 2HDM is a 2HDM scenario with seven free parameters: \(m_{A}\), \(m_{H}\), \(m_{H^{\pm}}\), \(m_{h}\), \(\tan\beta\), \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\) and \(m_{12}^{2}\). In the benchmark scenario considered in this work the following assumptions are made: \(m_{H}=m_{A}=m_{H^{\pm}}\), \(m_{h}=125\) GeV, \(m_{12}^{2}=m_{A}^{2}\sin\beta\cos\beta\). This leaves three free parameters: \(m_{H}\), \(\tan\beta\) and \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\). The search interpretations is shown in the \(m_{H}\)-\(\tan\beta\) plane for \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\) = 0.1 and -0.1

Figures 5-7 show the \(m_{H}\)-\(\tan\beta\) benchmark plane with \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)=\pm 0.1\) for the following analyses:

* "Combination of searches for non-resonant and resonant Higgs boson pair production in the \(b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma\), \(b\bar{b}\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) decay channels using \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with the ATLAS detector" [13] (126-139 fb\({}^{-1}\)).
* "Search for heavy Higgs bosons decaying into two \(\tau\) leptons with the ATLAS detector using \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV" [6] (139 fb\({}^{-1}\)).
* "Search for heavy resonances decaying into a \(Z\) or \(W\) boson and a Higgs boson in final states with leptons and \(b\)-jets in 139 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with the ATLAS detector" [11] (139 fb\({}^{-1}\)).

The excluded regions in Figures 5-7 are obtained by interpreting the ATLAS cross-section upper limits for gluon-gluon fusion produced Higgs bosons only. The large asymmetry in \(H\to hh\) between \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\) = 0.1 and -0.1 is mainly due to the structure of the \(Hhh\) coupling. These limits assume a narrow width Higgs boson, an assumption that is not valid for \(H\) boson widths beyond 5% due to possible interference effects. Such regions constitute large parts of the parameter space probed and they are denoted by hatched areas in the figures. For the search for Higgs boson pairs, the experimental analysis of Ref. [13] considers the combination of three channels: \(bbbb\), \(bb\tau\), and \(bb\gamma\gamma\). The \(bb\gamma\gamma\) channel is sensitive to natural widths of the \(H\) boson lower than a few percent, depending on the assumed mass of the \(H\) boson, and for that reason it has only been used in those parameter space areas that the 2HDM width prediction for the \(H\) boson is compatible with the experimental analysis in this channel. This is found to coincide with the region \(m_{H}\leq 600\) GeV. The rest of the parameter space (\(m_{H}>600\) GeV) uses the combination of only \(bbbb\) and \(bb\tau\tau\) channels. For the parameter space shown in these plots there is no similar issue with the width of the \(A\) boson. The excluded parameter space from this final state evades the constraints from H boson width and this is the reason it is shown superimposed on the region in which the width of H boson is more than 5%.

Figure 5: Regions of the \([m_{H},\tan\beta]\) plane excluded in type-I 2HDM via direct searches for heavy Higgs bosons for (a) \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)=-0.1\) and (b) \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)=+0.1\). Observed (colour filled areas) and expected (lines) limits are quoted at 95% CL. Only gluon–gluon fusion is considered for the production mode. The hatched region indicates \(H\) boson widths larger than 5%, for which the experimental limits for \(H\) boson searches are invalid. The cross-sections for the Higgs boson production are calculated using up to NNLO QCD corrections for gluon–gluon fusion as implemented in Sushi [16; 17; 18; 19]. The Higgs boson widths and branching ratios have been calculated using 2HDMC [26].

Expected limits (coloured filled areas) are quoted at 95% CL. Only gluon–gluon fusion is considered for the production mode.
