## 1 Introduction

Among the three and four-boson production processes, the production of three and four prompt photons in hadronic collisions are the processes with the higher cross sections, and, hence, the most accessible experimentally.

Multi-photon final states are a signature of beyond-the-SM (BSM) processes, such as Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson decaying to four photons via a pair of intermediate pseudoscalar particles, \(Z^{\prime}\) decaying to three photons or the production of exotic neutral particles decaying into a photon pair in association with a photon. They are also produced as a result of other rare SM processes such as \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) in association with a photon, di-Higgs production in the \(\gamma\gamma\) decay channel and allow constraining the \(Z\to 3\gamma\) branching fraction [1]. For all of these processes the SM non-resonant production constitutes the dominant irreducible background, which is important to model with high accuracy.

The production of prompt photons in hadron collisions isolated from hadronic activity can proceed via two different mechanisms: the direct production, in which the photon originates in the hard scattering, and the fragmentation production, in which the photon originates from the fragmentation of a quark or gluon. The latter is non-perturbative, and relies on fragmentation functions in fixed-order calculations or quantum electrodynamics (QED) parton showers (PS) for matrix elements (ME) with a lower photon multiplicity plus jets. The smooth-cone isolation [2] prescription removes the fragmentation component in an infrared-safe way, simplifying the calculations. Three-photon production has first been calculated to next-to-leading order (NLO) accuracy in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) in Ref. [3], and has recently become the first \(2\to 3\) process to be computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) accuracy, in both sector-improved [4] and \(q_{T}\) subtraction scheme [5]. The production of four-photons has been calculated at NLO in Ref. [6].

Differential cross-sections for the production of three-photons in \(pp\) collisions have been measured by ATLAS at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV [7]. The measurement showed that NLO calculations underestimate the data by 40-60%. This disagreement has been shown to be relieved by the NNLO corrections [4; 5].

In this note we study state-of-the-art Monte Carlo (MC) event generators setups from Sherpa MEPS@NLO and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8, exploiting the merging of NLO matrix elements to improve the description of three- and four-photon production at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) and/or \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The matrix elements of all the Monte Carlo predictions use a smooth-cone isolation using the formula suggested in Ref. [2]. The MC predictions are compared to fixed order calculations in different kinematic observables, and, for the case of three-photon production, to the ATLAS differential cross-section measurements.

This note is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the different predictions used throughout this note. Section 3 shows a comparison among the different setups for the \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV and 13 TeV three-photon production, at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) the predicted differential cross sections are compared against the measured distributions from Ref. [7]. Additionally, the effects of the electroweak (EW) corrections are studied. In Section 4 the comparison between the different generator setups for the four-photon production at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV is shown. Finally, conclusions are presented in Section 5.

## 2 Generator setups

In this section the specifications for each of the produced samples, such as the exact accuracy, the choice of parton distribution function (PDF) or the parton shower and underlying event are provided.

### Three-photon generation setups

Four different Monte Carlo event samples for the three-photon production are generated with Sherpa and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 as described below:

* Sherpa 0, 1\(j\)@NLO: In this setup, matrix elements accurate at NLO in QCD for three photon production with up to one additional parton are calculated with the Sherpa 2.2.8 MC programme using Comix [8] and OpenLoops 2[9, 10, 11, 12] libraries. They are matched with the Sherpa parton shower [13] using the MEPS@NLO prescription [14, 15, 16, 17] with a dynamic merging cut [18] built from a fixed value of 10 GeV. Samples are generated using the NNPDF3.0nnlo PDF set [19], along with the dedicated set of tuned parton-shower parameters developed by the Sherpa authors. The renormalisation and factorisation scales, \(\mu_{\text{R}}\) and \(\mu_{\text{F}}\), for the three-photon core process are set to the invariant mass of the triphoton system. The running of the strong coupling constant is chosen to be consistent with the PDF set and the QED coupling constant is evaluated in the Thomson limit, that is, at \(\alpha(0)=\frac{1}{137.036}\). Photons from the matrix elements are required to be central within \(|\eta^{\gamma}|<2.7\)1 and isolated according to a smooth-cone isolation [2] with \(\delta_{0}=0.1\), \(\epsilon_{\gamma}=0.1\) and \(n=2\). Additionally, a separation between the photons of \(\Delta R(\gamma_{1},\gamma_{2})=0.2\) is imposed together with a minimum invariant mass cut of the three-photon system at 5 GeV. Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). Angular distance is measured in units of \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\).
* Sherpa 0\(j\)@NLO+1, 2\(j\)@LO: To allow the inclusion of electroweak virtual corrections for the three-photon process available at NLO [20], a simplified setup is used, where only the three-photon production process is generated at NLO QCD, and matrix elements with one or two additional partons are included at LO QCD. The dominant electroweak corrections are then computed in the \(G_{\mu}\) scheme using the EW\({}_{\text{virt}}\) approach [21]. Since real photon production processes imply the evaluation of the electromagnetic coupling in the Thomson limit [22], we rescale the overall cross section with \(k_{3}=(\alpha(0)/\alpha_{G_{\mu}})^{3}\approx 0.90\) in the following comparisons. All other settings and versions are the same as for Sherpa 0, 1\(j\)@NLO.
* MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0, 1\(j\)@NLO FxFx : The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO program [23] is used to generate matrix elements at NLO accuracy in QCD with up to an additional parton at the matrix element. The different jet multiplicities are merged using the FxFx prescription [24] with a merging scale of 10 GeV. In this prescription, scales are chosen dynamically and are related to the clustering scales of the additional partons and on the core process. The value of the QED coupling constant is evaluated using the \(G_{\mu}\) scheme during generation, but the results are rescaled with \(k_{3}\approx 0.90\) for the same reason as described earlier. The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 2.6.7 is used for the generation at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV while version 2.7.2 is used for the \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV production. The NNPDF3.0nlo PDF set and the same smooth-cone isolation requirement as in the Sherpa samplesare employed. The hard-process matrix elements are then interfaced with the parton shower of Pythia8[25] (version 8.244) with the A14 [26] set of tuned parameters.
* MG5_aMC+Pythia8 \(0j\)@NLO: A similar generation setup as described for MG5_aMC+Pythia8 \(0,1j\)@NLO FxFx was used to compute the three-photon process predictions at NLO in QCD without any additional parton from the matrix element for \(\sqrt{s}=8\) and 13 TeV. As in the previous cases, the results are rescaled with \(k_{3}\approx 0.90\). The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO version 2.6.7 is used.

The measurement from Ref. [7] is additionally compared with next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD fixed-order predictions from Matrix[5]. The Matrix calculation uses the NNPDF3.1nnlo PDF set and the scale \(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=\frac{1}{4}(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma_{1}}+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{ \gamma_{2}}+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma_{3}})\). The photons are required to satisfy a smooth-cone isolation with parameters \(\delta_{0}=0.4\), \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ref}}=10\) GeV and \(n=1\), where \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{ref}}\) is the isolation requirement at \(\Delta R=\delta_{0}\) independent of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma}\)[27]. The \(G_{\mu}\) scheme is employed for the evaluation of the electroweak parameters, but the results are also rescaled with \(k_{3}\approx 0.90\) for the same reason as described earlier.

### Four-photon generation setups

Two different MC samples are simulated with Sherpa and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 for the production of four-photons as described below:

* Sherpa, \(0j\)@NLO+\(1,2j\)@LO: In this setup, the four-photon production process with no additional partons is generated at NLO accuracy in QCD using Sherpa, while matrix elements with one or two additional partons are included at LO accuracy in QCD. The additional settings of the generation remain the same as in Sec. 2.1 with the difference that the minimum invariant mass requirement is applied to the four-photon system. The fragmentation and renormalisation scales of the core process are set to the invariant mass of the four photons.
* MG5_aMC+Pythia8 \(0j\)@NLO: The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO progam is used for the simulation of four-photon production at NLO in QCD. The same settings specified in Sec. 2.1 for the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 \(0,1j\)@NLO FxFx setup are also employed here. The results are rescaled with \(k_{4}=(\alpha(0)/\alpha_{G_{\mu}})^{4}\approx 0.87\).

The MC event generator predictions are also compared with fixed-order predictions at NLO accuracy from MCFM 9.1[28]. The scales have been set to \(\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}=m_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma}\) and the PDF to the NNPDF3.1nnlo set. The contribution of a photon from parton fragmentation is also considered through the inclusion of LO QCD matrix element multiplied by a fragmentation function [29]. A photon isolation requirement of 10 GeV within a fixed cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) is applied.

## 3 Three-photon production

The phase space selection and the observables studied and their binning are the same as in the ATLAS measurement [7]. The events generated with the different Monte Carlo generators are analysed using the Rivet3[30] program 2. A summary of the phase space requirements used in the analysis is provided below:* the three photons with the highest transverse momenta are required to have \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma}\) greater than 27 GeV, 22 GeV and 15 GeV respectively;
* they are required to be in the central region of the detector \(|\eta^{\gamma}|<2.37\), avoiding the transition region between the barrel and the end-cap sections of the ATLAS electromagnetic calorimeter;
* an isolation criteria of \(\rm E_{\rm T}^{iso}<10\) GeV is imposed to the photons;
* a separation in the \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) plane of \(\Delta R>0.45\) between each pair of photons is imposed;
* the invariant mass of the three photon system is required to be larger than 50 GeV.

The photon isolation quantity, \(\rm E_{\rm T}^{iso}\), is computed from the transverse component of the sum of momenta of all particles falling in a cone of radius \(R=0.4\) around the photon except for those inside the core near to the photon, closer than \(|\Delta\eta|<0.0625\) and \(|\Delta\phi|<\)0.86, mimicking the experimental photon energy removal from the isolation energy computation. A correction is applied to this quantity to take into account the average transverse energy density coming from the underlying event, computed with the jet-area method [31].

### Three-photon production at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV

The inclusive fiducial cross section measured in the phase-space considered in Ref. [7] is:

\[\sigma_{\rm meas}=72.6\pm 6.5\;({\rm stat.})\pm 9.2\;({\rm syst.})\;{\rm fb},\]

where "stat." and "syst." denote the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the measurement. The predicted values of the inclusive fiducial cross sections for the three-photon production at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV are summarised in Fig. 1. Only the uncertainties arising from the missing higher orders are considered for the different predictions. The inclusion of an additional parton in the ME, even if only at LO accuracy, improves agreement in normalisation with respect to data in comparison to the \(3\gamma+0j@\)NLO plus parton shower predictions from MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 and also used in Ref. [7]3. These multi-leg setups allow a better modelling of the events in which a photon is radiated from a parton and, as shown in Fig. 1, are able to describe the data normalisation within uncertainties. The NNLO calculations from Matrix also provide an adequate agreement with the measured fiducial cross section within the uncertainties.

Footnote 3: The differences with respect to the values presented in [7] are due to the additional rescaling applied to the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0j@NLO for the evaluation of the QED coupling constant at the Thomson limit in this note.

The differential cross sections obtained from Sherpa MEPS@NLO, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 and Matrix are compared against data in Fig. 2 to 5 as functions of different observables: the transverse momentum of the leading, subleading and subsubleading photon (\(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 1}\), \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 2}\) and \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 3}\)); the difference in azimuthal angle between each pair of selected photons (\(\Delta\phi_{\gamma 1,\gamma 2}\), \(\Delta\phi_{\gamma 1,\gamma 3}\) and \(\Delta\phi_{\gamma 2,\gamma 3}\)); the absolute value of the difference in pseudorapidity between each pair of selected photon (\(|\Delta\eta_{\gamma 1,\gamma 2}|\), \(|\Delta\eta_{\gamma 1,\gamma 3}|\) and \(|\Delta\eta_{\gamma 2,\gamma 3}|\)); the invariant mass for each selected photon pair (\(\rm m_{\gamma 1,\gamma 2}\), \(\rm m_{\gamma 1,\gamma 3}\) and \(\rm m_{\gamma 2,\gamma 3}\)); and the invariant mass of the three photons system (\(m_{\gamma\gamma\gamma}\)). The shaded bands in the ratio panels represent the uncertainty due to the missing higher orders in the calculations which is computed using the 7-point variations of renormalisation and factorisation scales (i.e. single and simultaneous variations of \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) by factors 0.5, 1 and 2 times the nominal scale with \(0.5\leq\mu_{R}/\mu_{F}\leq 2\)). The PDF and \(\alpha_{s}\) uncertainties are not shown as they are typically smaller than the uncertainty from variations of scales. The vertical bars in the predictions shows the statistical uncertainties of the predictions which are only relevant in extreme phase-space regions.

All the predictions show a similar behaviour in the \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 1}\), \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 2}\) and \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 3}\) distributions showing a harder spectrum than the data. The angular distributions as well as the invariant mass distributions are well described within uncertainties by all the predictions except for MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0_j_@NLO which fails to describe the data normalisation and tend to have a different shape than that observed in data for the difference in azimuthal angle distributions. In all the observables, the uncertainties from Sherpa 0_j_@NLO+1, 2_j_@LO are larger than those of Sherpa 0, 1_j_@NLO due to the different accuracy of the ME, where the extra partons are only generated at LO in Sherpa 0_j_@NLO+1, 2_j_@LO. Sherpa 0, 1_j_@NLO has the same ME accuracy than MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0, 1_j_@NLO FxFx, however, the uncertainties coming from the scale variations are larger in the former. A comparison of the uncertainties from these two predictions is shown in Fig. 6. In addition to the nominal scale variations in Sherpa 0, 1_j_@NLO, which include a coherent treatment of the scale variations in the matrix elements and the parton shower, matrix-element-only scale variations are included in the figure showing a very similar size to the nominal variations. Thus, the differences in the scale variations are likely due to the different scale choices for these two predictions. A comparison of the predicted fiducial cross sections with different scale choices was performed in Ref. [4] showing variations of the order of the scale uncertainty of the predictions at NNLO in QCD. Additionally, it was shown that the scale dependence of the LO and NLO QCD inclusive predictions are artificially small. This is clearly observed in Fig. 1, where the NLO scale variations do not cover the differences with respect to the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0, 1_j_@NLO FxFx predictions, and in all the differential distributions shown in this section. Two partonic channels contribute to the NLO QCD inclusive predictions, namely \(q\bar{q}\) and \(gq\). While \(q\bar{q}\) receives significant but yet moderate corrections at NLO, \(gq\) is only LO at this point. Only at NNLO in QCD these two main channels are included together with higher-order corrections. Since new partonic reactions enter at each order inducing sizeable corrections, the LO and NLO scale uncertainties do not cover higher-order corrections. The scale uncertainties of MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0, 1_j_@NLO FxFx are similar to the uncertainties of the NNLO in QCD predictions from Matrix.

[7] compared to the predictions from Sherpa 0,1/\(\beta\)@NLO, Sherpa 0/\(\beta\)@NLO+1,2/\(\beta\)@LO, MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0,1/\(\beta\)@NLO FxFx, MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0/\(\beta\)@NLO and Matrix.

### Three-photon production at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV

In this section we study the production of three photons at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV. The predicted values of the inclusive fiducial cross sections at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV is summarised in Table 1, also showing the uncertainties arising from the missing higher orders. A similar pattern to the 8 TeV is visible, with the NLO+PS cross-section significantly smaller than the NLO-merged or NNLO predictions. Differential distributions are presented in Fig. 7, 8, 9 and 10. An additional observable, the transverse momentum of the three photons (\(p_{\Upsilon}^{\gamma\gamma\gamma}\)) is considered. At low \(p_{\Upsilon}\) this observable is sensitive to \(q_{\Upsilon}\) resummation effects, and thus to the modelling of the parton shower. As in the \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV case, all predictions but for the NLO+PS tend to agree well in all observables and differences are observed only in the regions of the phase-space affected by larger statistical uncertainties. The same conclusions about the size of the theoretical uncertainties arising from the missing higher orders can be drawn also for the \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV production.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c} \hline Generator & Cross section \(\pm\) Error [fb] \\ \hline Sherpa 0, \(1j\)@NLO & \(111^{+20}_{-1}\) \\ Sherpa 0\(j\)@NLO+1, \(2j\)@LO & \(98^{+28}_{-17}\) \\ MG5\_aMC+Pythia8 0, \(1j\)@NLO FxFx & \(104^{+13}_{-10}\) \\ MG5\_aMC+Pythia8 0\(j\)@NLO & \(70^{+6}_{-5}\) \\ Matrix, NNLO & \(104^{+13}_{-10}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

#### 3.2.1 Electroweak effects

Approximate EW corrections, based on infrared-subtracted virtual contributions and integrated real corrections, are included as on-the-fly weights in the S HERPA 0\(j\)@NLO+1, 2\(j\)@LO samples. The electroweak corrections are included in the MC sample as an additional weight and combined with the QCD corrections in an additive prescription. The effects in the differential cross sections as a function of \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 1}\), \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 2}\), \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 3}\) and \(m_{\gamma\gamma\gamma}\) are shown in Fig. 11. The impact of the EW corrections increases with the transverse momentum of the photons and affects more the transverse momenta distributions of photons which rank lower when ordered in transverse momenta. The EW correction effects are around 4% at 400 GeV for \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 1}\), around 14% at 400 GeV for \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 2}\), 8% at 250 GeV for \(E_{\rm T}^{\gamma 3}\) and 2% at 1 TeV for \(m_{\gamma\gamma\gamma}\). No significant effect arising from the EW corrections in the other distributions studied is observed. The effect of using a multiplicative combination of QCD and EW corrections leads to very similar results.

## 4 Four-photon production

A phase space close to that described in Section 3 is required for the four-photon production. The differences are listed below:

* The transverse momentum requirements to the photons are \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma 1}>25\) GeV, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma 2}>23\) GeV, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma 3}>21\) GeV, and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma 4}>21\) GeV for the leading, second-leading, third-leading and fourth-leading photon respectively.

Figure 11: Differential cross section distributions for three-photon production at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV as functions of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma 1}\) (a), \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma 2}\) (b) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma 3}\) (c) predicted from Sherpa 0j@NLO+1, 2j@LO. The blue dashed line shows the effect of the electroweak corrections using the additive scheme.

* The invariant mass of the four-photon system is imposed to be greater than 50 GeV and no requirement is applied to the invariant mass of the three leading photons after ordering in transverse momentum.

There is no available measurement of the differential cross sections of this rare SM process at the LHC and, thus, the predicted differential cross sections at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV from Sherpa, 0\(j\)@NLO+1, 2\(j\)@LO and MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0\(j\)@NLO are compared against each other and to the NLO fixed-order predictions from MCFM. A set of observables that characterises the four-photon production in proton-proton collisions has been studied. These observables include the variables described in Section 3.1 together with others that allow to survey the fourth-leading photon phase-space. The additional variables considered are: the transverse momentum of the fourth-leading photon (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma\mathrm{4}}\)), the difference in azimuthal angle between the fourth- and the third-leading photons (\(\Delta\phi_{\gamma\mathrm{3},\gamma\mathrm{4}}\)), the absolute value of the difference in pseudorapidity between the same photons (\(|\Delta\eta_{\gamma\mathrm{3},\gamma\mathrm{4}}|\)); the invariant mass of the system formed by the same photons (m\({}_{\gamma\mathrm{3},\gamma\mathrm{4}}\)), the invariant mass and transverse momentum of the four photons system (\(m_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma}\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma\gamma\gamma}\)); and the scalar sum of transverse momentum of the four photons (\(\sum_{i}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma_{i}}\)). The comparisons between the Sherpa, 0\(j\)@NLO+1, 2\(j\)@LO, MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0\(j\)@NLO and MCFM setups is shown in Fig. 12 to 15.

As in other non-resonant photon production, like the three-photon production processes presented in Section 3, the NNLO QCD corrections are large. These corrections can be mostly captured by including the real corrections in multi-leg generator setups even at LO. In this case, the MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0\(j\)@NLO only includes the four-photon ME at NLO showing a large normalisation difference with respect to Sherpa, 0\(j\)@NLO+1, 2\(j\)@LO which includes up to two additional partons in the ME. The differences in the predictions can go up to 50%. Several observables show also a difference in shape between the predictions notably in m\({}_{\gamma\mathrm{1},\gamma\mathrm{2},\gamma\mathrm{3}}\), \(m_{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma}\), \(\Delta\phi_{\gamma\mathrm{1},\gamma\mathrm{2}}\) and, more notably, in \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma\gamma\gamma\gamma}\). The last two can be expected due to the difference in accuracy of the generators for which the additional partons allow more different configurations in the \(\Delta\phi_{\gamma\mathrm{1},\gamma\mathrm{2}}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\gamma\gamma\gamma}\) variables. The uncertainties on the predictions are larger in Sherpa, 0\(j\)@NLO+1, 2\(j\)@LO than in MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0\(j\)@NLO, because two relevant variations are included only in the Sherpa, 0\(j\)@NLO+1, 2\(j\)@LO prediction: the scale variations in the parton shower, and, more significantly, scale variations in the multi-leg matrix elements that are able to capture an important part of the higher-order corrections. As in the three-photon production case, the scale uncertainties of the inclusive NLO predictions are expected to be artificially small due to the opening of new partonic channels inducing sizeable corrections. The MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0\(j\)@NLO predictions only take into account scale variations on the inclusive process, which yields an uncertainty band that is often not even overlapping with the one from the more precise Sherpa prediction. The fixed-order calculations from MCFM predict a similar fiducial cross section to that of MG5_aMC+Pythia8 0\(j\)@NLO, but show noticeable differences in the description of some observables.

The predicted values of the inclusive fiducial cross sections for the four-photon production at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV is summarised in Table 2 for the phase space considered in this note. Only the uncertainties arising from the missing higher orders are considered.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c} \hline Generator & Cross section \(\pm\) Error [ab] \\ \hline Sherpa, 0\(j\)@NLO+1, 2\(j\)@LO & 76\({}^{+23}_{-14}\) \\ MG5\_aMC+Pythia8 0\(j\)@NLO & 47 \(\pm\) 3 \\ MCFM, NLO & 55 \(\pm\) 3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Taking into account the results of the Sherpa, 0\(j\)@NLO+1, 2\(j\)@LO setup in Table 2, the expected number of events for the full Run 2 dataset is \(11^{+3}_{-2}\). This number of events could be larger if the transverse momentum threshold requirements were lowered. It would be the first four boson final state measured at the LHC and the upcoming Run 3 dataset should allow to reach an observation of this process.

## 5 Conclusion

Three- and four-photon production are rare SM processes which are useful to thoroughly test the SM as well as for constraining several BSM scenarios. Higher-order QCD corrections to these processes are large as shown by the NNLO QCD predictions for the three-photon process.The dominant part of these effects can be obtained in Monte Carlo event generators through the merging of multi-leg matrix-elements with NLO accuracy. Four (Two) different Monte Carlo generator setups have been studies for the three-(four-)photon production from Sherpa and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8. Additionally, NNLO fixed-order predictions for three-photon production from Matrix and NLO predictions for four-photon production from MCFM have also been used in this note. The NNLO and multi-leg NLO predictions describe well the \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV three-photon production data from the ATLAS Collaboration and show a clear improvement over the inclusive NLO predictions. Similarly, in the four-photon production case, large differences in the shape, normalisation and size of theory uncertainties are observed between the predictions from Sherpa and those of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO+Pythia8 and MCFM, showing the relevance of the inclusion of additional partons in the matrix elements and the underestimation of the theoretical uncertainties when only inclusive NLO predictions are used.
