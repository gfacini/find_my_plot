###### Abstract

In order to evaluate the thermal properties of the proposed r\(\phi\) module for the ATLAS silicon microstrip detector at LHC, a test cooling module was built at KEK. The test was done at room temperature with chilled water. A finite element thermal analysis was performed to simulate the cooling test. Further thermal simulation was done for the case of temperature-dependent leak current in the silicon bulk. The conditions of thermal runaway are estimated from the simulation.

## Introduction

In the proposed ATLAS silicon microstrip detector [1], number of readout channels is expected to exceed 4 millions. Even if very advanced technology is to be used, the power dissipation by on-detector electronics will reach to an order of 10 KW in total. This non-trivial amount of heat must be extracted efficiently to outside the detector volume by a cooling system.

In addition to the power dissipation by on-detector electronics, the reverse leak current due to radiation damage in the bulk of silicon would become important. The leak current linearly increases as the total dose accumulates. The leak current generates shot noise and thus decreases the S/N ratio. It also generates heat in silicon. After several years of operation at LHC, the power dissipation in silicon reaches a few tenth of Watt per module. Since the leak current has a strong temperature dependence (an order of magnitude per 20 degree) [2], keeping the silicon detectors at lower temperature provides various advantages in the operational and performance points of view. Moreover, it is pointed out that, due to this strong positive dependence on temperature, a thermal runaway may take place in silicon if cooling scheme is not sufficient [3].

The anti-annealing effect after the exposure of large fluences of particles was discovered recently [4]. This effect becomes very noticeable above \(10^{\circ}\)C. Therefore it is essential to maintain the silicon detectors near or below \(0^{\circ}\)C. The optimum temperature is said to be around \(-7^{\circ}\)C [5].

It is a technical challenge to keep the large system

of silicon detectors at or below 0\({}^{\circ}\)C and d, at the same time, to achieve minimum material thickness for the best performance of the tracking system.

## 2 Measurements with a cooling test module

A test module with a silicon detector of 6.8\(\times\)12\(\times\)0.06 cm\({}^{3}\) was built at KEK to evaluate the thermal properties of the proposed r\(\phi\) module. A photograph of the test module is shown in Fig. 1. The test system was made up of the test module, a cooling water circulation with temperature regulation, heaters and a hybrid recorder as shown in Fig. 2. The test module consisted of silicon detector, (mocked) electronics part, and cooling channel as shown in detail in Fig. 3. The materials and their dimensions are shown in the same figure. Since beryllium plates was not available at hand, pieces of aluminum and copper were used instead. The thermal conductivities of these materials are sufficiently similar to that of beryllium for the initial cooling test.

A water cooling pipe of 2.2 mm in inner diameter was attached on one side of the copper cooling plate. Nichrome wires were attached in zig-zag shape on the surfaces of the mocked top and bottom electronics. A Cu-Be wire was sandwiched in between two silicon wafers to simulate the heat generation by leakage current. For temperature measurement a number of thermo-couples were glued on the various part of the test module. Their numbers (#1-#20) and locations are shown in the figure. Another set of thermo-couples was set to measure the temperature of the cooling water and air.

The test module was hanged by thin nylon wires so that the silicon plane was placed vertically. Horizontal position was tried with no appreciable difference in measurements. The whole setup is exposed to room air.

The test was done with three different temperatures of cooling water;

T\({}_{\mathrm{w}\mathrm{i}\mathrm{r}\mathrm{e}}\) = 296.6 K, 292.0 K, 287.5 K.

The temperature on ambient air was stable at

T\({}_{\mathrm{i}\mathrm{r}\mathrm{e}}\) = 296.8 K

during the measurement. For each set of test, three different combinations of heat generation were tried;

Q\({}_{\mathrm{C}}\)Q\({}_{\mathrm{Si}}\) case 1 5 W 1 W case 2 5 W 0 W case 3 0 W 1 W where Q\({}_{\mathrm{C}}\) and Q\({}_{\mathrm{Si}}\) are the total power dissipations in the electronics and in the silicon detector, respectively. In all cases, stable measurements were achieved within ten minutes.

of the bulk leakage current can be well expressed by

\[\rm I(T)\propto T^{2}\cdot exp(-\frac{E_{g}}{2k_{B}T})\]

where \(E_{g}\) is the effective gap energy of about 1.23 eV and \(k_{B}\) is the Boltzmann constant.

In ANSYS program version 4.4a the electrical resistance of material can be made temperature dependent. We have assumed silicon bulk elements to have bulk conductance with the same temperature dependence as that of the leakage current. The expected heat generation was realized by using a 2-D thermal-electrical solid element in the program. The calculation was done iteratively until the result became stable within 0.1 \({}^{\circ}\)C.

The simulation was done with exactly the same module geometry. The total power dissipation in electronics is assumed to be 5 W. The temperature of air is assumed to be equal to that of the point #11 in Fig. 3. Three cases

\[\rm T_{air}=T_{\#11}=-10\,\ 0\ and\ 10\ ^{\circ}C,\]

were simulated both with and without air convection. The heat generation \(Q_{Si}\) in the silicon bulk of 6\(\times\)12\(\times\)0.03 cm\({}^{3}\) due to the leak current is parameterized as

\[Q_{Si}=Q_{0}\cdot(\frac{T}{T_{0}})^{2}\cdot e^{(-\frac{E_{g}}{2k_{B}}(\frac{1} {T}-\frac{1}{T_{0}}))},\ \ \rm T_{0}=273\]

where \(Q_{0}\) is the heat generation at 0 \({}^{\circ}\)C. Fig. 7 shows the summery of the simulation for the case with air convection of 12 W/m\({}^{2}\)K. Temperatures of three representative points (#1, #3 and #6) on silicon are plotted. One must be careful that the graph is shown as a function of \(Q_{0}\), not actual heat dissipation in silicon. It is clearly seen that the thermal runaway does take place above certain values of \(Q_{0}\) as indicated by hatched arrows in the figure. The thermal runaway always occurs at the farthest end point from the cooling channel as expected. Fig. 8 shows the limit of \(Q_{0}\) as a function of cooling water temperature with and without air convection. It clearly indicates the convection plays an important role in preventing the thermal runaway.

The heat generation by bulk leakage current is expected to be an order of \(Q_{0}\)=0.5 Watt after ten years of operation at LHC [6]. Therefore a tentative conclusion from the simulation is that the cooling temperature near 0\({}^{\circ}\)C is just adequate with no help of air convection. One notices that a factor of 2\(\sim\)3 better margin is expected at \(-10^{\circ}\)C. It should be noted that many assumptions were made in the present simulation. For example, one of the biggest ones is T\({}_{water}\)=T\({}_{air}\). Dependence of module as well as cooling configuration must be studied further.

## 4 Conclusions

A test module was built at KEK to evaluate the thermal property of the proposed r\(\phi\) module of the ATLAS silicon microstrip detector. The cooling test have shown that

* silicon detector can be effectively cooled from one side of the r\(\phi\) module,
* the air convection play an important role in the temperature distribution in silicon,

A thermal simulation was performed to understand the cooling test and to evaluate the thermal runaway for temperature-dependent leak current in silicon. These simulations can be summarized as follows;

* a very good agreement with actual observation was obtained,
* the convection coefficient at the silicon surface to air is about 12 W/m\({}^{2}\cdot\)K,
* a cooling system with coolant temperature at 0\({}^{\circ}\)C is barely adequate for 10-year operation at LHC. Lower the cooling temperature, the wider the margin from the thermal runaway.
