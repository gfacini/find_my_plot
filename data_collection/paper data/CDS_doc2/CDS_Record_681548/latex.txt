The observation of a charged Higgs boson would be a clear sign of new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the charged Higgs could be copiously produced in the decays of the top quark, if kinematically allowed. In this note, the charged Higgs discovery potential of the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented through the study of a new channel: \(pp\to t\bar{t}\to H^{\pm}bW^{\mp}\bar{b}\) with \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) and \(W^{\mp}\to q\bar{q}^{\prime}\) (hadronic channel). This channel leads to an improvement in the expected sensitivity of the ATLAS detector to the discovery of the MSSM Higgs bosons. In particular, for charged Higgs masses below the top quark mass and in the intermediate \(\tan\beta\) region (\(\tan\beta=5-10\)), signal significances upwards of \(5\sigma\) can be reached with an integrated luminosity of \(10\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\). Furthermore, the mass of the charged Higgs boson can be determined from the transverse mass distribution with a precision of about \(4\%\).

Introduction

In the SM, one scalar doublet is responsible for the electroweak symmetry breaking giving as a result only one neutral Higgs boson. However, the SM has serious drawbacks which find a solution in Supersymmetric (SUSY) models. The MSSM [1] is the simplest SUSY extension of the SM. The MSSM Higgs sector consists of two Higgs doublets which lead to five Higgs particles after electroweak symmetry breaking: a neutral lighter CP-even \(h\), a neutral heavier CP-even \(H\), a neutral CP-odd \(A\) and a pair of charged Higgs \(H^{+}\) and \(H^{-}\). At tree level, all masses and couplings can be expressed as a function of only two parameters, generally taken to be \(m_{A}\), the mass of the CP-odd Higgs \(A\) and \(\tan\beta\), the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets. The charged Higgs mass at tree level is given by:

\[m_{H^{\pm}}^{2}=m_{W^{\pm}}^{2}+m_{A}^{2} \tag{1}\]

where \(m_{W^{\pm}}\) is the mass of the \(W^{\pm}\) boson.

The NLO prediction of the \(t\bar{t}\) cross section at the LHC1 is 833 pb [2], implying a production of over 8 million \(t\bar{t}\) pairs with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. If \(m_{H^{\pm}}<m_{t}\), the charged Higgs is produced through \(t\to H^{+}b\), which together with \(t\to W^{+}b\) practically saturates the top decay width in the MSSM. The branching ratio of \(t\to H^{+}b\) versus \(\tan\beta\) is shown in Fig. 1 for different \(m_{H^{+}}\) values; it has a dip around \(\tan\beta=\sqrt{m_{t}/m_{b}}\sim\)7.5, where the \(t\to H^{+}b\) decay width has a minimum [3]. For branching ratio calculations, radiative corrections were considered and the Maximal Mixing scenario [4] was used:

Footnote 1: At the LHC, the gluon-gluon fusion process, \(gg\to t\bar{t}\), accounts for about 90% of the total \(t\bar{t}\) production and the \(q\bar{q}\ \to t\bar{t}\) process accounts for the rest.

* SUSY scale: \(M_{SUSY}\)=1 TeV
* Gaugino mass parameter: \(M_{2}\)=200 GeV
* Higgsino mass parameter: \(\mu\)=-200 GeV
* Stop mixing parameter: \(X_{t}\)=\(\sqrt{6}M_{SUSY}\)

Assuming a heavy SUSY spectrum [5], the MSSM charged Higgs will only decay into SM particles:

* For \(m_{H^{\pm}}>m_{t}\), and at high \(\tan\beta\) (\(\tan\beta>\)10), the \(H^{\pm}\to tb\) and the \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) channels are the dominant decay modes while at low \(\tan\beta\), the charged Higgs decays almost exclusively into \(tb\).

* For \(m_{H^{\pm}}<m_{t}\), \(H^{+}\to\tau\nu\) has a branching ratio of \(\sim 100\%\) independent of \(\tan\beta\).

The charged Higgs searches at LEP [6] and the Tevatron [7] already set lower limits on \(m_{H^{\pm}}\). Charged Higgs bosons would have been produced at LEP through the process \(e^{+}e^{-}\to H^{+}H^{-}\). The LEP charged Higgs searches where carried out under the assumption that the two decays \(H^{+}\to c\overline{s}\) and \(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\) exhausted the charged Higgs decay width, but the relative branching ratio was left free. Since no signal was found, a charged Higgs boson with \(m_{H^{\pm}}<78.6\) GeV was excluded at 95% CL independently of the branching ratio. At the Tevatron, the CDF and D\(\emptyset\) experiments carried out direct and indirect searches for the charged Higgs through the channel \(p\overline{p}\to t\overline{t}\) with at least one top decaying into \(H^{\pm}b\). The direct searches looked for an excess of tau leptons with respect to the SM predictions (since BR(\(H^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\)) \(>\) BR(\(W^{+}\to\tau^{+}\nu\))). In the indirect searches, a disappearance search was made, using selection criteria optimized for the SM process \(p\overline{p}\to t\overline{t}\to W^{+}bW^{-}\overline{b}\). They excluded at 95% CL charged Higgs bosons with \(m_{H^{\pm}}<\)160 GeV and \(BR(t\to H^{+}b)>\)0.36 in the \(0.3<\tan\beta<150\) region.

The charged Higgs discovery potential of the ATLAS and CMS detectors at the LHC was also investigated in detail:

* For a heavy Higgs, \(m_{H^{\pm}}>m_{t}\), the main production mechanisms would be \(gg\to tbH^{\pm}\) and \(gb\to tH^{\pm}\). The ATLAS discovery potential for a heavy Higgs was reported in detail in [8]. With 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), a significance above 5\(\sigma\) can be achieved with the \(H^{\pm}\to tb\) channel in the low and high tan\(\beta\) regions for

charged Higgs of masses up to 400 GeV. Moreover, the \(H^{\pm}\to\tau^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) channel extends the discovery reach to lower \(\tan\beta\) values in the high \(\tan\beta\) region, as shown in Fig. 2. The production of a heavy charged Higgs with \(pp\to tH^{\pm}\) and \(H^{\pm}\to\tau^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) was also studied in CMS [9]. A significance better than \(5\sigma\) was achieved for \(\tan\beta>15\) between 180 GeV\(\lesssim m_{A}\lesssim 200\) GeV in the \((m_{A},\tan\beta)\) space with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.
* For \(m_{H^{\pm}}<m_{t}\), as already stated, top quark decays would be a good source of charged Higgs at the LHC, through \(pp\to t\overline{t}\) and \(t\to H^{+}b\). As also remarked, in this mass range the channel \(H^{\pm}\to\tau^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) is practically the only decay mode2. In ATLAS, the \(H^{\pm}\to\tau^{\pm}\nu_{\tau}\) decay was extensively studied using a full simulation Monte Carlo [10]. This study concentrated on the search in \(t\overline{t}\) events for an excess of \(\tau\) leptons from \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) decay with respect to the expected \(\tau\) leptons rate from \(W^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) decay. At that time, a \(\tau\)-jet trigger was not yet envisioned, thus one of the top quarks was required to decay leptonically in order to trigger on the isolated \(e\) or \(\mu\). However, in this so-called leptonic channel, the charged Higgs boson mass cannot be easily reconstructed because several neutrinos are produced in the final states of interest: \[pp\to t\overline{t}\] \[t\to H^{+}b\] \[H^{+}\to \tau^{+}\nu_{\tau}\] \[\tau^{+}\to\mbox{\it hadrons}\;\bar{\nu_{\tau}}\] with three different possibilities for the \(\overline{t}\) decay: \[\begin{array}{ll}\overline{t}\to W^{-}\overline{b}&W^{-}\to l\nu_{l}&(l=e, \mu)\\ \overline{t}\to W^{-}\overline{b}&W^{-}\to\tau\nu_{\tau};&\tau\to l\nu_{\tau} \nu_{l}\\ \overline{t}\to H^{-}\overline{b}&H^{-}\to\tau\nu_{\tau};&\tau\to l\nu_{\tau} \nu_{l}\end{array}\] With 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), a signal from a light charged Higgs would be observed for all values of \(m_{H^{\pm}}\lesssim m_{t}-20\) GeV over most of the \(\tan\beta\) range. However, for moderate \(\tan\beta\) values (5-10), for which the expected signal rates are lowest, the accessible values of \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) are lower than this limit by \(\sim\)20 GeV. In CMS, the search for charged Higgs production in top decays [11] was made by looking for an excess of \(\tau\)-jets, and also by looking for a depletion of dilepton events over the expected sample size in the absence of signal events.

The conclusion was that for \(m_{H^{\pm}}\lesssim 160\) GeV and \(2<\tan\beta<40\), 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) would be necessary for exclusion and discovery respectively.

The ATLAS and CMS combined \(5\sigma\) limits to a MSSM charged Higgs are shown in Fig. 2 for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

In this note, we study the potential of the ATLAS detector in finding a MSSM charged Higgs produced in top decays through the channel:

\[pp\to t\bar{t}\] \[t\to W^{+}b\] \[W^{+}\to q\bar{q}^{\prime} + c.c.\] \[\bar{t}\to H^{-}\bar{b}\] \[H^{-}\to \tau^{-}\overline{\nu_{\tau}}\] \[\tau^{-}\to\mbox{\it hadrons }\nu_{\tau}\]

The diagram that contributes the most to this process is shown in Fig. 3.

This so-called hadronic channel was not investigated at the LHC before. In addition, it gives the possibility to extract the charged Higgs mass out of the transverse mass distribution because the two final state neutrinos are produced in the same hemisphere of the event.

In section 2, the possibility in ATLAS to observe a MSSM charged Higgs produced in top decays is studied: after selection cuts, the statistical significance is evaluated at several points of the MSSM (\(m_{A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) space in order to determine the \(5\sigma\) limit for discovery of the charged Higgs.

* \(t\overline{t}\to W^{\pm}bW^{\mp}\overline{b}\) background: This is the most important source of background because it often results in the same final state than the signal. However, in one-prong \(\tau\) hadronic decays, \(\tau\)-jets from charged Higgs decay are harder than those produced in \(W^{\pm}\) decays due to helicity effects. The scalar \(H^{-}\) boson will only couple to right-handed \(\tau\)'s, whereas the vector \(W^{-}\) boson will only couple to left-handed \(\tau\)'s. In the simplest case where \(\tau^{-}\) decays into one charged pion (12.5% of the \(\tau^{-}\) decays), the \(\pi^{-}\) from \(H^{-}\) are harder than the ones produced in \(\tau^{-}\) decays from \(W^{-}\)[12].
* QCD background: Even if the topology of these events is very different from the signal, they must be considered due to their huge cross section.
* \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) and \(W\) backgrounds: The following sources of \(Z\) and \(W^{\pm}\) production are taken into account: \[pp \to Z/\gamma^{*}(+jets)\] \[pp \to W(+jets)\] \[pp \to Z/\gamma^{*}\ Z/\gamma^{*};\ Z/\gamma^{*}\ W;\ WW\] These processes also have large cross sections. In addition, \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons can produce true \(\tau\)-jets. The cross sections (\(\sigma\times BR\)) for the different processes are listed in Table 1.

### Event generation

Events were generated at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with Pythia 6.161 CTEQ5L PDF's and TAUOLA 2.6 for \(\tau\) lepton decay Fortran codes. The detector simulation was parametrised by ATLFAST [13] and ATLFAST-B was used for jet mis-tagging and energy calibration. The standard set of ATLFAST parameters shown in Table 2 were used.

Within the MSSM Maximal Mixing Scenario, data sets corresponding to 127 points in the \((m_{H^{\pm}}/m_{A},\tan\beta)\) plane were generated, as shown in Fig. 4. The statistics of each generated process is given in Table 3.

### Event selection

The final state considered in this work consists of 2 \(b\)-jets, 2 light jets, 1 \(\tau\)-jet and large \(E_{Tmiss}\). The selection cuts applied to the signal and background processes are specially designed for maximal rejection of the QCD events in order to achieve a high statistical significance throughout the whole (\(m_{A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) space 3.

Footnote 3: In this section, all results are given for \(\tan\beta=30\) and an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\).

The selection cuts are classified into different groups:

1. Trigger selection The (t20xe30).OR.(j60xe60) trigger condition is applied, i.e., at least one \(\tau\)-jet of \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(E_{Tmiss}>30\) GeV or at least one jet of \(p_{T}>60\) GeV and \(E_{Tmiss}>60\) GeV.
2. 3-tag cut and no isolated lepton We require exactly 2 \(b\)-tagged jets, exactly 1 \(\tau\)-tagged jet, at least 2 light jets and no isolated lepton.
3. \(p_{T}\) and \(E_{Tmiss}\) cuts Since the signal is characterized by a high \(p_{T}\)\(\tau\)-jet and a large \(E_{Tmiss}\) due to the neutrinos on the charged Higgs side, one requires: * \(E_{Tmiss}>45\) GeV* \(p_{T}^{jet}>\) 25 GeV
* \(p_{T}^{b\,jet1}>\) 35 GeV and \(p_{T}^{b\,jet2}>\) 20 GeV The \(E_{Tmiss}\) cut is very effective against QCD background as shown in Fig. 5. In Fig. 6 the \(p_{T}^{jet}\) distribution from a charged Higgs signal with \(m_{H^{\pm}}\)=90 GeV and from SM \(t\bar{t}\) decays is shown. The \(\tau\) polarization effects described in section 2.1 can still be observed even for a charged Higgs signal of such low mass. This is the worse case: the \(p_{T}^{\tau jet}\) cut is more effective for higher Higgs masses.
4. Top mass reconstruction on the \(W\) side (\(t\to W^{+}b;\ W\to q\bar{q}\)) The \(W\) and top mass reconstruction cuts are of capital importance in rejecting the QCD background. The \(W\) mass is the invariant mass of the two light jets, \(m_{jj}\). In case that there are more than two light jets (a high energy gluon-jet may be mis-identified as a light jet), the combination with the mass closest to the \(W\) mass, \(m_{W^{\pm}}=\) 80.33 GeV4 is selected. Then, two top quark candidates are formed from the two light jets and one of the \(b\)-jets (\(m_{jjb}\)). The \(m_{jjb}\) closest to the top mass, \(m_{t}=175.0\) GeV4is chosen. In addition, a \(p_{T}\) cut on the light jets is applied. Altogether, the cuts require: Footnote 4: Quoted value in Pythia.

* \(|m_{jj}-m_{W}|<20\) GeV with \(m_{W}=\) 80.33 GeV

charged Higgs signal of \(m_{H^{\pm}}=127.0\) GeV and for QCD background events5. Footnote 5: The large fluctuations in the part of the \(\Delta\phi(\vec{p}_{T}^{\,top1},\vec{p}_{T}^{\,top2})\) distribution eliminated by this cut are due to the very small statistics remaining after the previous cuts, and the relatively high weight of these events.
6. Cuts on the charged Higgs side (\(\overline{t}\to H^{-}\overline{b};\ H^{-}\rightarrow\tau^{-}\bar{\nu}_{\tau}\)). On this side one has a reconstructed \(b\)-jet and a \(\tau\)-jet. This pattern can be easily faked by a quark+FSR. In order to eliminate these QCD events, the following cuts are applied: * \(P_{REL}(\tau\ jet,b\ jet)\equiv\frac{|\vec{p}_{\tau\ jet}|\sin\theta_{\tau\ b }}{|\vec{p}_{\tau\ jet}+\vec{p}_{b\ jet}|}>0.2\) * \(p_{T}^{\tau\ jet}/p_{T}^{b\ jet}>0.8\). The \(p_{T}^{\tau\ jet}/p_{T}^{b\ jet}\) distribution is shown in Fig. 9 for two charged Higgs samples of mass \(m_{H^{\pm}}=127.0\) GeV and \(m_{H^{\pm}}=145.0\) GeV and for SM \(t\overline{t}\) decays after the fifth group of selection cuts. The effect of this cut depends on the charged Higgs mass: the momentum of the \(\tau\)-jet increases with \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) while the \(p_{T}\) of the \(b\)-jet decreases. This translates in an increase of the \(p_{T}^{\tau\ jet}/p_{T}^{b\ jet}\) ratio. Furthermore, \(\tau\)-jets produced in \(W^{\pm}\) decay from \(t\overline{t}\) SM decays are not as hard as those produced in charged Higgs decay. Therefore, the \(p_{T}^{\tau\ jet}/p_{T}^{b\ jet}\) ratio is also a good discriminating variable against SM \(t\overline{t}\) background.

for \(m_{H^{\pm}}>\)113 GeV, because for lower masses they would eliminate a very large fraction of the signal6.

Footnote 6: Furthermore, for such low \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) values, the \(t\to bH^{+}\) branching ratio is large, and a statistical significance well above 5 can be obtained already with the selection cuts of section 2.3.

The SM \(t\overline{t}\) background is reduced by \(\sim\)85% by the \(p_{T}^{\tau\,jet}\) and the \(M_{T}\) cuts. The number of expected MSSM charged Higgs signal events at three different mass points and of SM \(t\overline{t}\) decays are given in Table 5. In Fig. 11 is shown the fraction of charged Higgs signal events retained applying the \(M_{T}\) and \(p_{T}^{\tau\,jet}\) cuts to the events remaining after the selection cuts of section 2.3, as a function of \(m_{H^{\pm}}\). It can be seen that the fraction of retained events increases with the charged Higgs mass because the \(\tau\)-jet from \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) decays has a higher momentum.

After applying all these cuts, the statistical significance given by Eq.(2) was computed.

Figure 10: Transverse mass distribution after selection cuts (section 2.3) for MSSM \(H^{+}\) signal events with \(m_{H^{+}}=127\) GeV and for SM \(t\overline{t}\) events with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\).

### Systematic effects affecting the statistical significance

To obtain a conservative value of the statistical significance achievable with this analysis, the result of Eq.(2) is corrected by the repercussion of several systematic effects that might decrease it.

A 10% error on the luminosity determination is assumed [14], taking a conservative view of luminosity measurements at hadron colliders. From LHC and Tevatron data, the \(t\overline{t}\) cross section will be known with a precision better than 10% [15]. Hence, the calculated Pythia \(t\overline{t}\) cross section is changed by \(\pm\) 10% and the statistical significance is recalculated. The systematic errors on the integrated luminosity and on the \(t\overline{t}\) cross section will affect the statistical significance through the calculated yield of SM \(t\overline{t}\).

In addition, a systematic uncertainty of \(\pm\)1% on the jet energy scale is assumed, as well as a \(\pm\)4% uncertainty on the \(E_{Tmiss}\) scale [16].

Regarding the systematics of the \(\tau\)- and \(b\)-tagging efficiencies, a \(\pm\)3% uncertainty on the \(\tau\)-tagging efficiency is assumed, based on results of past experiments [17]. Concerning \(b\)-tagging, different \(b\)-tagging efficiency/jet rejection combinations are considered. The statistical significance is computed for two values of the light and \(c\)-jet rejections maintaining the same \(b\)-tagging efficiency. Thus, the \(c\)- and light jet rejections are changed from \(R_{\rm e}\)=10, \(R_{light}\)=100 to \(R_{\rm e}\)=9, \(R_{light}\)=90 and \(R_{\rm e}\)=11, \(R_{light}\)=110 and then the statistical significance is recalculated.

The worse-case contribution of each systematic uncertainty to the statistical

The \(M_{T}>80\) GeV and \(p_{T}^{\tau\,jet}>\)30 GeV cuts were only applied to the \(H^{\pm}\) signal samples with \(m_{H^{\pm}}>\)113 GeV.

significance can be represented as an error of the statistical significance given by:

\[\Delta\sigma_{sys_{i}}=\sqrt{\sigma^{2}-\sigma_{sys_{i}}^{2}} \tag{4}\]

where \(\sigma\) is the statistical significance given by Eq.(2) and \(\sigma_{sys_{i}}\) is the worse-case statistical significance taking into account the systematic effect \(i\). Summing quadratically all contributions, the total effect on the statistical significance is obtained:

\[\Delta\sigma_{sys_{total}}=\sqrt{\sum_{i}\Delta\sigma_{sys_{i}}^{2}} \tag{5}\]

and the final significance is computed as:

\[\sigma_{final}=\sqrt{\sigma^{2}-\Delta\sigma_{sys_{total}}^{2}} \tag{6}\]

### Results

The contributions of each systematic effect to the error on the significance (Eq.(4)) and the final significances are given in Table 6, at four different \(m_{A}/m_{H^{\pm}}\) mass values and \(\tan\beta=30\), for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). The final significance given by Eq.(6) and the significance without taking into account systematic errors (Eq.(2)) as a function of \(\tan\beta\) for different charged Higgs masses are given in Fig. 12. The \(5\sigma\) discovery limit is also drawn. Due to the decrease of the \(t\to bH^{+}\) branching ratio the charged Higgs cannot be discovered when \(m_{H^{\pm}}\to m_{t}\) (e.g. \(m_{H^{\pm}}=155\) GeV) around the \(\tan\beta\) minimum (\(4\lesssim\tan\beta\lesssim 10\)). Also, for \(m_{H^{\pm}}=160\) GeV, the charged Higgs can

In order to obtain the \(5\sigma\) contour in the MSSM (\(m_{A},\tan\beta\)) space for a given \(\tan\beta\), the two closest \(m_{A}\) points with \(\sigma_{final}>\)5 and \(\sigma_{final}<\)5 respectively are considered and the \(m_{A}\) point at which \(\sigma_{final}=\)5 is obtained by linear interpolation.

In Fig. 13, the \(5\sigma\) discovery plot is shown. The results for the hadronic \(W^{\pm}\) decay channel (\(W\to qq\prime\)) are plotted with 10 and 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity respectively. Note the \(5\sigma\) line for the leptonic \(W^{\pm}\) decay channel (already given in Fig. 2) with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The power of the hadronic \(W^{\pm}\) decay channel is clear: with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) the discovery reach of the hadronic \(W^{\pm}\) decay channel is better than that of the leptonic \(W^{\pm}\) decay channel with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). Furthermore, using the \(W^{\pm}\) hadronic decay channel and with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), the dip between \(\tan\beta\sim\)10 and \(\tan\beta\sim\)5 seen in Fig. 2 is now covered.

The hadronic channel extends the discovery region down to very low branching ratios, namely \(BR_{5\sigma}(t\to bH^{+})\sim\)1.5% with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) and to \(BR_{5\sigma}(t\to bH^{+})\sim\)1.0% with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\).

The discovery reach at the LHC for any of the five MSSM Higgs bosons with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) is given in Fig. 14. Note that the \(5\sigma\) line for the hadronic channel presented in this note is drawn for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) (dashed line) and 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) (solid line). For the first time, due to this analysis, the region around \(\tan\beta\sim\)6 of the overall MSSM Higgs

discovery potential is covered. As a result, combining ATLAS and CMS studies, the \(5\sigma\) survey in the MSSM (\(m_{A}\),\(\tan\beta\)) space of the different MSSM Higgs production and decay channels is now complete.

## 3 Mass extraction

In the previous section, the ATLAS discovery potential for a MSSM charged Higgs produced in \(t\)-quark decays was evaluated by simulating a counting experiment in which the background was estimated assuming the null hypothesis \(-\)namely, SM \(t\overline{t}\) decays and rest of SM background processes. Naturally if a significant excess of events were observed, the focus of the analysis would shift to investigating the signal and to extracting the charged Higgs mass. This section is devoted to this purpose.

In this perspective, the signal consists of events with only one charged Higgs as shown in Fig. 3, because the events with two charged Higgs cannot be used for the mass reconstruction. Concerning the backgrounds, they are composed of MSSM \(t\overline{t}\) decays with two or no Higgs, all the other SM backgrounds (QCD, \(Z/\gamma^{*}(+{\rm jet})\), \(W(+{\rm jet})\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)\(Z/\gamma^{*}\), \(Z/\gamma^{*}W,\ WW\)) and backgrounds from SUSY processes. The \(\sigma\times BR\) of all these processes are given in Table 7 for the (\(m_{A}\)=95 GeV, \(\tan\beta=30\)) point in the MSSM.

Figure 14: ATLAS and CMS combined \(5\sigma\) discovery contours for the MSSM Higgs bosons (\(h\), \(H\), \(A\), \(H^{+}\), \(H^{-}\)) obtained with different decay channels with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The \(5\sigma\) discovery contour for a charged Higgs produced in top decays obtained with the present work is also added (labelled as \(t\to bH^{+}\), \(H^{+}\to\tau\nu\); \(\overline{t}\to W^{-}\overline{b}\), \(W^{-}\to q\overline{q}^{\prime}\)) with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) (dashed line) and with 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) (solid line). The Maximal Mixing scenario was used.

Concerning the SUSY backgrounds, they were generated at the SUSY point:

* \(m_{1/2}=200\) GeV
* \(m_{0}\)=1000 GeV
* \(sign(\mu)\)=+
* \(A_{0}\)=2000

where \(m_{1/2}\) is the gauginos and higgsinos mass at GUT scale; \(m_{0}\), the squarks, sleptons and Higgs bosons mass at this scale; \(sign(\mu)\) is the sign of the higgsino mass parameter and \(A_{0}\) is the trilinear Higgs-sfermion-sfermion coupling also at GUT scale. These SUSY backgrounds were passed through the selection cuts of section 2.3. After event selection, only 62 events of the type \(b\overline{b}\phi\) (\(\phi=h,H,A\)) were left in the (\(m_{A}=\)112.8 GeV, \(\tan\beta=\)3) MSSM point, which has the maximum production cross section, together with 7.2 \(t\overline{t}\phi\) (\(\phi=h,H,A\)) events. All the other SUSY backgrounds listed in Table 7 were rejected. In addition, after applying the \(M_{T}>\)80 GeV and \(p_{T}^{\tau\,jet}>30\) GeV cuts given in section 2.4, all SUSY \(b\overline{b}\phi\) events were eliminated and only 2 \(t\overline{t}\phi\) events were left in this MSSM (\(m_{A}\), \(\tan\beta\)) point. Furthermore, the \(t\overline{t}\) decay background in the MSSM \(H^{\pm}\) production scenario is less than the SM \(t\overline{t}\) background, because the \(t\to W^{+}b\) branching ratio in the MSSM is always lower than 1 (for example, for \(m_{H^{\pm}}=\)127.0 GeV and \(\tan\beta=\)30, the MSSM \(t\overline{t}\) background branching ratio is 0.88).

### Event generation and selection cuts

For the mass studies, the generation of events as well as the simulation of the detector response were performed within the ATHENA framework [18], written

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l||c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c||}{**Process**} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\(\sigma\times BR\) (pb)} \\ \hline \hline \multirow{3}{*}{MSSM \(t\overline{t}\)} & \(t\overline{t}\) signal, one \(H^{\pm}\) prod. & 57.2 \\ \cline{2-3}  & \(t\overline{t}\to H^{+}bH^{-}\overline{b}\) & 12.6 \\ \cline{2-3}  & rest of \(t\overline{t}\) decays to SM particles & 422.2 \\ \hline \hline \multirow{3}{*}{SUSY backgrounds} & \(t\overline{t}\); \(\chi_{1}^{\pm}\chi_{1}^{\pm}\)... & \(\sim\)1 \\ \cline{2-3}  & \(Z\phi\); \(W^{\pm}\phi\); \(ff\phi\) (\(\phi=h,H\)) & \(<\)1 \\ \cline{2-3}  & \(t\overline{t}\phi\) (\(\phi=h,H,A\)) & \(<\)1 \\ \cline{2-3}  & \(b\overline{b}\phi\) (\(\phi=h,H,A\)) & \(<1\times 10^{-3}\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

in C++. The Monte Carlo event samples were generated with ATHENA PythiaModule, within the MSSM Maximal Mixing scenario, using CTEQ 5L PDF's. The TauolaModule7 was used to describe polarized \(\tau\) lepton decay. The Atlfast package for fast detector simulation together with the AtlfastB Algorithm for jet mis-tagging and energy calibration were used.

Footnote 7: PythiaModule and TauolaModule interface the Fortran Pythia 6.161 and TAUOLA 2.6 versions respectively.

Several charged Higgs masses were considered, always with \(\tan\beta=30\):

\[m_{H}^{\pm}(\mathrm{GeV})= 84.9,90.2,95.1,100.1,105.2,110.2,114.8,\] \[119.7,123.3,127.0,130.0,134.7,138.6,145.0, \tag{7}\] \[149.9,155.8,160.0,165.1\]

In addition, the SM backgrounds listed in Table 1 were generated. All these events were subjected to the selection cuts given in section 2.3.

SUSY backgrounds were not generated for the mass extraction studies because the event selection of section 2.3 rejected practically all these events. The effect of the very few remaining SUSY backgrounds is negligible in the mass plots, because most of them have transverse masses under 80 GeV, the lower cut to be applied to this transverse mass, as explained below.

### Mass extraction with a maximum likelihood method

After applying selection cuts, the transverse mass given by Eq.(3) was obtained from the \(\tau\)-jet and the missing transverse momentum. In Fig. 15 the total transverse mass distributions of charged Higgses of mass \(m_{H^{\pm}}=127.0\), 138.6 and 145 GeV are shown, with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. In choosing the cuts (already described in section 2.3) care was taken to retain a good fraction of the high-mass Higgs signal; nevertheless the decreasing \(BR(t\to bH^{+})\) limits the statistics at this charged Higgs mass region.

Transverse masses were extracted with a maximum likelihood method. All distributions corresponding to the 18 masses listed in (7) were generated with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data and histogrammed in bins of 6 GeV. Next, the contents of the \(M_{T}\) histograms were smoothed and normalized to unity because only the shape of the \(M_{T}\) distribution is considered8.

Footnote 8: The ’extended maximum likelihood method’ of ref.[19] might allow a more precise \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) determination, because it uses the signal rate which is mass-sensitive. However we did not deem it necessary for a Monte Carlo study.

After smoothing and normalizing the \(M_{T}\) distributions, only the part with transverse masses between 80 GeV and 170 GeV was kept (as already seen in Fig. 15, the Figure 15: Transverse mass distributions of MSSM charged Higgs of masses 127.0 GeV, 138.6 GeV and 145 GeV with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). For the signal, the leading edge shifts to higher transverse masses with increasing charged Higgs mass. The Maximal Mixing scenario was used. Only the region between the two vertical lines (80 GeV\(<M_{T}<\)170 GeV) was used for the mass extraction.

\(M_{T}>\)80 GeV region is almost background free, except for the \(t\overline{t}\) decay background tails). Next, a polynomial fit was performed; it was found that polynomials of the 7th degree provided a good fit. In Fig. 16 the obtained transverse mass probability density functions are shown. The expected shift of the right-hand shoulder of the distribution when increasing Higgs mass is clearly seen. For some mass values, in addition to the Higgs \(M_{T}\) shoulder, spurious structures can be observed; they appear to be artifacts of the polynomial fit, due to statistical fluctuations. Naturally, the fits to low-statistics \(M_{T}\) probability density functions (i.e. \(m_{H^{\pm}}\)=160.0, 165.1 GeV) gave less reliable results due to large bin-to-bin fluctuations.

To evaluate how well the Higgs mass could be extracted from the \(M_{T}\) distributions, three representative masses were chosen:

\[m_{H^{\pm}}^{SEL}=127.0,\ 138.6,\ 145.0\ \ \mathrm{GeV}\]

Figure 16: Transverse mass probability density functions obtained from a polynomial fit (of 7th degree) to the smoothed and normalized \(M_{T}\) distributions for different charged Higgs masses.

The likelihood function at any \(m_{H^{\pm}}^{SEL}\) point is given by:

\[\mathcal{L}_{SEL}=\prod_{i=1}^{N_{SEL}}P_{SEL}(M_{T_{i}}) \tag{8}\]

where \(P_{SEL}\) is the probability density function for the chosen mass, \(M_{T_{i}}\) with \(i=1,...,N_{SEL}\) is the transverse mass of event number \(i\) and \(N_{SEL}\) is the total number of expected events. The likelihood function of the Monte Carlo generated sample with charged Higgs mass \(m_{H^{\pm}}^{k}\) is given by:

\[\mathcal{L}_{k}=\prod_{i=1}^{N_{SEL}}P_{k}(M_{T_{i}}) \tag{9}\]

that is, using the same set of \(M_{T_{i}}\) with \(i=1,...,N_{SEL}\) transverse masses. After taking the logarithm of Eq.(8) and (9), the delta log-likelihood function for each charged Higgs of mass \(k\) was computed:

\[\Delta\ln(\mathcal{L}_{k})=\ln(\mathcal{L}_{SEL})-\ln(\mathcal{L}_{k})=\sum_ {i=1}^{N_{SEL}}\left[\ln(P_{SEL}(M_{T_{i}}))-\ln(P_{k}(M_{T_{i}}))\right] \tag{10}\]

As an example, the \(\Delta\ln(\mathcal{L}_{k})\) values as a function of the \(k\) masses are shown in Fig. 17 for \(m_{H^{\pm}}^{SEL}=127.0\) GeV. The reconstructed charged Higgs mass is obtained by a parabolic fit around the minimum of the delta-loglikelihood function.

To evaluate the statistical error on the extracted Higgs mass, the procedure was repeated \(N_{EXP}\) times, thereby performing as many pseudo-experiments. For each pseudo-experiment a random Gaussian fluctuation to the number of expected

Inside the plot, the reconstructed charged Higgs mass for this pseudo-experiment is written. The error bars are the standard deviations of the delta log-likelihood values for \(N_{EXP}=\)1000 pseudo-experiments.

events \(N_{SEL}\) was computed, that is \(N^{\prime}_{SEL}=N_{SEL}+\delta N_{SEL}\). Then, a random set of \(N^{\prime}_{SEL}\) transverse masses was generated according to the probability density function \(P_{SEL}(M_{T})\). The delta log-likelihood values and their minima were calculated again by the same procedure and the distribution of the \(N_{EXP}\) values obtained was fit by a Gaussian. Its mean and the standard deviation give the charged Higgs mass and the statistical error on it. In Fig. 18, the distribution of the reconstructed charged Higgs masses obtained is shown for 10000 pseudo-experiments, for \(m^{SEL}_{H^{\pm}}=127.0\) GeV. The statistical errors for the three tested mass values are all around 1 GeV, as will be shown below.

### Systematic errors

Two different sources of systematic uncertainties were considered for the mass extraction studies:

1. Systematics due to detector effects Uncertainties on the \(\tau\)-tagging efficiency, jet and \(E_{Tmiss}\) energy scales were considered as in the discovery potential studies. On the contrary, the uncertainties on the \(t\overline{t}\) cross section and on the luminosity measurement, that were important for the significance calculations, were not considered here, because they would only produce a global scale effect on the final \(M_{T}\) distribution. Such scale effect cancels out when normalizing in order to get the transverse mass probability density functions.
2. Systematics due to the mass extraction method

Figure 18: Distribution of the reconstructed charged Higgs mass for \(m^{SEL}_{H^{\pm}}=\)127.0 GeV for 10000 pseudo-experiments. A Gaussian fit is performed. The mean and the standard deviation give the reconstructed charged Higgs mass and its statistical error.

Several causes of method-dependent systematic errors were considered and their effects were estimated:

* _Binning_: the variation of the reconstructed Higgs mass using bins on 4 and 5 GeV (instead of 6 GeV) was studied.
* _Degree of the fit polynomial_: the transverse mass probability density functions were fit with polynomials of the 9th and 11th degree.
* _Insufficient statistics_: for all different values of \(m_{H^{\pm}}^{k}\), Poisson fluctuations were added to the values of each bin of the \(M_{T}\) distributions, and the three representative Higgs masses were again reconstructed with the same maximum likelihood method.

Altogether, the method-associated systematic error on the reconstructed Higgs mass is about 1 GeV.

In Table 8, the systematic errors found for each tested mass value are shown. It can be seen that the systematic errors due to detector effects dominate, in particular those due to the uncertainties in the \(E_{Tmiss}\) scale and in the \(\tau\)-tagging efficiency. On the latter large fluctuations between mass values are seen; they appear to be due to the event sample statistics. Overall, systematic errors dominate over the fit statistical error.

### Results

The final reconstructed MSSM charged Higgs masses for each of the Monte Carlo generated \(m_{H^{\pm}}\): 127, 138.6 and 145.0 GeV, are listed in Table 9 together with the statistical and systematic errors and the relative precision of the measurement. The conclusion is that with 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data and using this maximum likelihood method,

the charged Higgs mass could be extracted from the transverse mass distribution with a precision better than 4%.

## 4 Conclusions

The discovery potential of the ATLAS detector for a MSSM charged Higgs produced in top decays has been studied in detail through the channel \(pp\to t\overline{t}\to H^{\pm}bW^{\mp}\overline{b}\) with \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) and \(W^{\mp}\to q\bar{q}^{\prime}\) (hadronic channel). If a charged Higgs is produced in top decays with BR(\(t\to H^{+}b\)) \(\geq\)2%, it will be discovered in ATLAS with only 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity.

The combined ATLAS and CMS MSSM Higgs discovery potential is substantially increased because the \(W\to q\overline{q}^{\prime}\) channel covers the \(5\lesssim\tan\beta\lesssim 10\) region which was not covered before by any other MSSM Higgs channel. Considering jointly all the different MSSM Higgs boson detection channels, the discovery potential scan in the MSSM space is now complete.

Another important aspect of the channel investigated here is that it gives the possibility to measure the charged Higgs mass. The MSSM charged Higgs mass was obtained from the transverse mass distribution by means of a maximum likelihood method and a relative precision of about 4% could be achieved with the same integrated luminosity.
