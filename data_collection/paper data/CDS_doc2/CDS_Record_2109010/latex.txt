**Studies of the ATLAS Inner Detector material using \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV \(pp\) collision data**

The ATLAS Inner Detector comprises three different technologies: the Pixel detector (Pixel), the silicon strip tracker (SCT), and the transition radiation drift tube tracker (TRT). The material in the ATLAS Inner Detector is studied with several methods, using the \(pp\) collision sample collected at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in 2015. The material within the innermost barrel regions of the ATLAS Inner Detector is studied using reconstructed hadronic interaction and photon conversion vertices from samples of minimum bias events. It was found that the description of the Insertable B-Layer, which is the new, innermost Pixel layer installed in 2014, in the geometry model was missing some material components. After updating the model, data and simulation show good agreement at the barrel region. The Pixel services (cables, cooling pipes, support trays) were modified between the Pixel and SCT detectors in 2014. The material in this region is also studied by investigating the efficiency with which tracks reconstructed only in the Pixel detector can be matched to tracks reconstructed in the Pixel and SCT detectors. The track extension efficiencies in samples of minimum bias events in data and simulation are observed to agree well in the barrel region. Some discrepancies are observed in the Pixel service region at forward pseudorapidities. These studies have led to several improvements in the description of the material in the ATLAS Inner Detector simulation.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS detector [1] is a general-purpose particle detector at the LHC. The Inner Detector (ID) system (see Figure 1) which consists of the pixel detector (Pixel), the silicon strip tracker (SCT) and the transition radiation drift tube tracker (TRT), is used to measure the trajectories and momentum of charged particles in the region of pseudorapidities\(|\eta|<2.5\)1. The ID surrounds the beam pipe, and is located inside a solenoid that provides a 2 T axial magnetic field.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the center of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the center of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates \((r,\phi)\) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidty is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). Angular distance is measured in units of \(\Delta R\equiv\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}+(\Delta\phi)^{2}}\).

The LHC operation re-started from June 2015, referred to as Run 2, after the Long Shutdown 1 (LS-1) in 2013-2014. The Pixel detector, which comprises three barrel layers and two end caps with three disks each, was expanded in 2014 during by inserting a new, innermost barrel layer called the Insertable B-Layer (IBL) [2]. The IBL is placed at \(r=33.5\) mm. It consists of 14 staves which cover \(|\eta|<3.03\) with over 12 million pixel sensors of \(50\times 250\)\(\mu\)m\({}^{2}\) each. The addition of the IBL to the ID significantly improves the track reconstruction performance, in particular both the transverse and longitudinal impact parameter resolution [3]. The extra material corresponds to approximately 1.5% of a radiation length for radial perpendicular tracks originating from \(r=0\) averaged over \(\phi\) at the IBL staves.

The beam pipe was also replaced in order to allow for the installation of the IBL. The new beam pipe, mainly comprising a 0.8 mm thick beryllium pipe with an inner radius of 23.5 mm, outer radii of 24.3 mm (minimum, \(|z|<30\) mm) and 28.2 mm (maximum, \(|z|>311\) mm). The outer radii is smaller the Run 1 beam pipe of 34.3 mm. The central part of the new beam pipe in \(|z|<311\) mm is not covered by the thermal insulator, in order to reduce materials. The material composition of the new beam pipe was measured using X-rays to a precision of 1% before installation. The IBL staves are placed between the Inner Positioning Tube (IPT) at \(r=29.0\) mm and the Inner Support Tube (IST) at \(r=42.5\) mm. The IPT and IST are made from carbon fiber and resin. The thickness of the IPT reduces to 0.325 mm for \(|z|<311\) mm, from 0.455 mm at the outermost edge.

The radii of the three barrel layers of the Pixel detector are 50.5 mm, 88.5 mm, and 122.5 mm respectively. Three layers are referred to as the B-Layer, Layer-1 and Layer-2 when moving radially outwards from the interaction point. The barrel and end cap layers of the Pixel detector are supported by the octagonal prism structure referred to as the Pixel Support Frame with a radius of \(r\simeq 200\) mm. It is inserted inside the Pixel Support Tube (PST) which has a radius of 229 mm. The Pixel detector was extracted from ATLAS during the LS-1, refurbished and re-installed. Together with recovery of the disabled modules, the service panels located at \(|z|\geq 780\) mm inside the PST were replaced with the new service panels, called nSQPs [4]. The optical-electrical signal conversion boards, which were previously placed on the old service panels at \((r,z)\simeq(174,1070)\) mm, have been moved to the location called the ID end plate, located between the ID and the end cap calorimeters. These devices are relatively far away from the interaction point, to reduce ionizing radiation dose, and easier to access for maintenance. This also helps to reduce the material amount of the nSQPs compared to the previous service panels.

The SCT consists of 4,088 silicon strip modules, arranged in four barrel layers and two end caps with nine wheels each. Each module is composed of two layers of silicon strip detector sensors glued back-to-backwith a relative stereo angle of 40 mrad. The TRT is the outermost of the ID subdetectors. It is made of 350,848 gas-filled straw tubes. The SCT and TRT hardware are unchanged since Run 1.

Although the ID material was studied in detail during Run 1[5; 6; 7], the material composition and structure of the ID are considerably changed due to the upgrades and refurbishments described above. To establish the track reconstruction performance during Run 2, it is crucial to re-examine the amount of the material and its structure. The main focus of the study presented in this note is the regions where the material structure were modified: the IBL and the Pixel services.

This note describes studies of the Run 2 ID material structures using three different techniques. In Section 2 the common data set used in these analyses is introduced. Studies with reconstruction of hadronic interactions and photon conversion vertices will be discussed in Section 3 and 4 respectively. These studies depict the detailed structure of the new beam pipe, IBL, and its support tubes as well as existing detector at outer radii. The experimental resolution on hadronic interaction vertices is higher than the typical resolution on photon conversion vertices. This is due to larger opening angle between final state particles in case of hadronic interactions. The track extension efficiency from Pixel to SCT, denoted hereafter as the SCT extension efficiency, is sensitive to the materials between the Pixel and the SCT. The corresponding study is described in Section 5. These three methods give complementarity for understanding of the material in the ID.

## 2 Data and Monte Carlo simulation

The data used in this note were collected during proton-proton collision runs at center-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in June 2015. The average number of collision per bunch crossing is approximately 0.005. Events were selected from colliding proton bunches in which the minimum bias trigger scintillators (MBTS) [8] trigger recorded one or more counters above threshold on either side. The MBTS are mounted at each end of the detector in front of the liquid-argon end cap calorimeter cryostats at \(z=\pm 3.56\) m and segmented into two rings in pseudorapidity, \(2.07<|\eta|<2.76\) and \(2.76<|\eta|<3.86\). For the hadronic interaction and photon conversion analyses, 6 runs containing approximately 120 million events are used. For the SCT extension efficiency analysis, a single run is used.

The general reconstruction setup is the same as the Run 2 charged particle multiplicity measurement with minimum bias samples [9], with track reconstruction down to transverse momentum, \(p_{T}\) of 100 MeV. Each event is required to contain a primary vertex, reconstructed from at least two tracks, as described in Ref. [10].

Different Monte Carlo generator models are used to compare the data to the simulation geometry model. In this note, The Pythia 8[11], and Epos[12] generators are used. In Pythia 8 inclusive hadron-hadron interactions are described by a model that splits the total inelastic cross-section into non-diffractive (ND) processes, dominated by \(t\)-channel gluon exchange, and diffractive processes involving a colour-singlet exchange. The simulation of ND processes includes multi-parton interactions (MPI). The A2 tune of Pythia 8 with the MSTW2008lo parton distribution function sample [13] is used to derive the detector corrections for these measurements. The Epos generator provides an implementation of a parton-based Gribov-Regge [14] theory which is an effective QCD-inspired field theory describing hard and soft scattering simultaneously. The LHC tune [15] is used for the Epos generator. All the events are processed through the ATLAS detector simulation program [16], which is based on Geant4[17]. They are then reconstructed and analysed by the same software chain used for the data.

In this note the data are compared to two simulation geometry models. The first model hereafter denoted as _default_, is the model employed in 2015 simulation samples. The second is denoted as the _updated_ geometry model, which is a modified version of the default geometry model in which some missing material in the IBL staves is added. As the SCT extension efficiency is not sensitive to the material description of the IBL, only the updated geometry is used.

Figure 2 shows the \(rz\)-view of the material budget for radiation and nuclear interaction length for the updated geometry model for the barrel region of the Pixel (including the IBL) and the SCT detectors. Photon conversions are sensitive to the material in terms of the radiation length, while hadronic interactions are sensitive to it in terms of the nuclear interaction length. Probing the materials with both methods enables complementary cross-checking of the studies.

## 3 Hadronic interactions

Inelastic hadronic interactions produce multiple daughter charged particles when hadrons traverse the detector material. The experimental resolution2 on the radial position of hadronic interaction verticesvaries between 65 and 230 \(\mu\)m from the beam pipe to Layer-1 depending on radius. The hadronic vertices can thus be used to make a precise description of the material structure of the ID.

### Analysis

Event selectionPile-up interactions are rejected by requiring each event to contain no additional vertices with four or more tracks. Only one reconstructed vertex is present in the event, which will be referred to as the primary vertex. The primary vertex is required to have at least five tracks that pass the _LoosePrimary_ requirements, defined as follows:

* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>400\) MeV.
* \(|\eta|<2.5\).
* At least seven silicon hits3. Footnote 3: The term “silicon hit” commonly refers to the measurement positions of pixel or strip charge deposit clusters associated to the track in IBL, Pixel or SCT.
* Number of silicon holes4 is not greater than two. Footnote 4: A hole is counted when an active module that the track traverses does not have a corresponding hit.

Secondary vertex reconstructionThe tracks used for secondary vertex reconstruction are required to satisfy the following criteria:

* Track fitting \(\chi^{2}\) divided by the number of degrees of freedom (\(N_{\mathrm{dof}}\)) satisfies \(\chi^{2}_{\mathrm{track}}/N_{\mathrm{dof}}<5.0\).
* Track transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>100\) MeV.

Figure 2: \(rz\)-view of the geometry model of the Inner Detector barrel region of Pixel and SCT, for (a) radiation length (\(X_{0}\)) and (b) nuclear interaction length (\(\lambda_{I}\)). Calculation is based on the updated geometry model, as discussed in Section 2.

* At least one SCT hit.
* Number of hits assigned to multiple tracks is fewer than five.
* Transverse impact parameter with respect to the beam line \(|d_{0}^{\text{BL}}|>5.0\) mm.

The last requirement is for rejecting vertices which have fake tracks, or which are accidentally composed by tracks not originating from the identical interaction vertex.

The vertices are reconstructed using the VKLVrt vertex reconstruction algorithm [18]. Fake vertex rejection depending on the position of secondary vertex is applied by requiring hit patterns in the Pixel and SCT for tracks forming the vertex. The required hit patterns are consistent with the assumption that daughter particles fly from inner to outer radii. Figure 3 illustrates the fake tracks rejection scheme. The tracks composing the vertex must not have hits in the layers at smaller radii than the vertex, and the tracks are also required to have hits in the closest outer layer to the vertex radius, which is defined as the distance of the vertex in the \(xy\)-plane from the origin of the ATLAS coordinate system. If the vertex radius is inside or within several milimeters (depending on the layer) of one of the layers, hits are required on the next outer layer, but hits are neither forbidden nor required for the inner layer (Figure 3). This reconstruction technique probes material in the region of \(|z|\lesssim 250\) mm at the beam pipe (\(r=23.5\) mm) and \(|z|\lesssim 400\) mm at the Pixel Layer-2 (\(r=122.5\) mm).

Secondary vertex selectionOnly secondary vertices at radii greater than 20 mm are considered. An additional requirement is applied to the pointing vector of the secondary vertex, which is defined as the displacement vector of the secondary vertex referred to the primary vertex. The pseudorapidity of the

Figure 3: Schematic illustration of fake tracks rejection. (a) The vertex is between the two layers of B-Layer and Layer-1 sensors. The tracks of the reconstructed secondary vertex must not have hits on the layers inner than the vertex radius (i.e. IBL and B-Layer), and must have hits on the closest layer outside the vertex (i.e. Layer-1). (b) The vertex is close to the Pixel B-Layer sensors. In this example where the vertex is just inside the B-Layer, the tracks are not allowed to have hits on the IBL but may have hits on the B-Layer, and must have hits on the Layer-1. Analogous requirements are made on vertices close to the other layers.

secondary vertex, denoted as \(\eta_{\rm sv}\), is defined using the pseudorapidity of the pointing vector. Vertices are required to have \(|\eta_{\rm sv}|<2.4\).

To reduce background contributions, further requirements are applied on reconstructed secondary vertices. A set of veto cuts is applied to reject \(K_{\rm S}^{0}\), \(\Lambda^{0}\) decays and photon conversion vertices in-flight. The applied veto cuts are as follows:

\(K_{\rm S}^{0}\to\pi\pi\) veto

The \(|m_{\rm sv}(\pi\pi)-m_{K_{\rm S}^{0}}|>50\)  MeV requirement is applied for neutral 2-track vertices, where \(m_{\rm sv}\) is the so-called secondary vertex invariant mass, calculated using the track parameters at the vertex. The \(m_{\rm sv(\pi\pi)}\) is calculated assuming pion masses for both tracks. \(m_{K_{\rm S}^{0}}\) is the mass of \(K_{\rm S}^{0}\) (497.61 MeV).

\(\Lambda^{0}\to p\pi\) veto

The \(|m_{\rm sv}(p\pi)-m_{\Lambda^{0}}|>15\)  MeV requirement is applied for neutral 2-track vertices, where \(m_{\rm sv}(p\pi)\) is calculated assuming that the particle with larger \(p_{\rm T}\) is proton, and the other particle is assumed to be pion5. \(m_{\Lambda^{0}}\) is the mass of \(\Lambda^{0}\) (1115.68 MeV).

Footnote 5: The mass difference between \(\Lambda^{0}\) and proton is small compared to the pion mass. In case of relativistically boosted system of two-body decay of such mass fraction, the heavier daughter particle tends to convey more of momentum at the lab-frame.

Photon conversion veto

The \(m_{\rm sv}(\rm ee)>100\)  MeV requirement is applied for neutral 2-track vertices, where \(m_{\rm sv}(\rm ee)\) is calculated assuming electron masses for both tracks.

A set of quality cuts is also applied to reject fake vertices. The quality cuts are as follows:

* Each track used in the secondary vertex fit is required to have \(p_{\rm T}>300\) MeV.
* Vertex \(\chi^{2}\) satisfies \(\chi^{2}_{\rm vertex}/N_{\rm dof}<4.5\).

The fake vertex fraction is estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation. Unless all the tracks have a matched truth particle and all the matched truth particles are daughter particles originating from the same truth vertex, the reconstructed vertex is classified as fake. The fake rate is calculated to be approximately 5% at the beam pipe, 10% at the IBL, and 22% at Pixel Layer-2 after applying all requirements.

This reconstruction is sensitive to the barrel region of the ID. Figure 4 shows the \(xy\)-view of the hadronic interaction candidates for the data. The material in the detector can be seen clearly due to the excellent resolution of the reconstructed hadronic vertices.

### Comparison of data and simulation

In data, the axis of each cylindrical layer of the beam pipe, IBL, Pixel barrel layers and other support tubes has an offset perpendicular to the \(z\)-axis from the origin of the ATLAS coordinate system. The offset is considered to be due to differences between the design and actual positions of the layers. In order to compare data and simulation in radial distributions, positions of secondary vertices in the data are corrected by the offset in the \(xy\)-plane. The offset of each layer of the layers listed above is obtained by fitting a sinusoidal curve to the \(r\phi\)-profile. Figure 5 shows the radial distribution of the hadronic interaction candidates integrated over all \(z\) ranges after this correction has been applied. In Figure 5(a), the structure of tubes of the beam pipe at \(r\simeq 24\) mm, IPT at \(r\simeq 29\) mm, and IST at \(r\simeq 42.5\) mm are clearly visible and consistent between data and simulation. The structure between IPT and IST at \(30<r<40\) mm is the IBL stave. The default geometry model was found to be missing surface mount device (SMD) components, e.g. capacitors, located on the front-end chips of the IBL which are at around \(r\simeq 32\) mm. The corresponding amount of material was added to the updated geometry model. This correction significantly improves the agreement as demonstrated in Figure 5.

## 4 Photon conversions

The interaction of photons with energy higher than two electron masses with the material within the ATLAS ID can lead to the conversion of a photon into an \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pair. The probability for a photon to convert is almost directly proportional to the amount of material it traverses. This behavior makes a measurement of the conversion rate of photons produced in \(pp\) collisions an ideal probe of the material content of the ATLAS detector [6]. The di-photon decays of copiously produced light neutral mesons (particularly the \(\pi^{0}\)) in \(pp\) collisions provide a high statistics source of photon conversions. From an experimental perspective, photon conversions exhibit the distinct topology of a pair of oppositely charged tracks with an opening angle consistent with zero at the conversion vertex. This section describes a study of the material within the inner layers of the ATLAS ID using photon conversions reconstructed from tracks alone.

### Analysis

Event selectionEvents which contain exactly one reconstructed primary \(pp\) interaction with at least five associated tracks, as described section 3.1, are retained for further analysis. The requirement on

The radial positions of vertices in the data are corrected by the amount of the offset of each layer component (see text in detail).

the number of associated tracks is present in order to select a data sample dominated by non-diffractive minimum bias events [9].

Photon conversion reconstructionThe reconstruction of photon conversions begins with the identification of pairs of charged particle tracks reconstructed with the standard ATLAS track reconstruction algorithms. Track pairs are selected which satisfy a number of criteria based on the photon conversion topology, including selections on the polar angle difference between the two tracks, the distance of minimum approach between the two track helices and the distance between the first hits on the two tracks. The common vertex is reconstructed for each track pair, and a quality requirement based on the \(\chi^{2}\) of the fitted vertex is imposed. Fitted track vertices which satisfy these criteria are considered candidate photon conversion vertices.

Conversion vertex selectionIn order to reduce background contamination and optimise vertex position resolution, reconstructed photon conversion vertex candidates are subject to a range of quality requirements. Candidates are retained for further analysis if they satisfy the following criteria:

* Vertex \(\chi^{2}\) satisfies \(\chi^{2}<3.0\).
* Each track constituting the vertex must have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>200\) and at least six SCT hits.
* An electron probability discriminator, based on information from the TRT detector, must be greater than 0.1 for each track constituting the vertex.
* The pseudo-rapidity of the candidate converted photon must satisfy \(|\eta|<2.4\).
* The impact parameter of the back extrapolated photon trajectory with respect to the primary vertex must be within 5 mm in the transverse plane and 20 mm in the longitudinal plane.

The purity of photon conversion candidates is defined as the fraction of vertices associated with genuine conversions and not a falsely identified combination of two tracks in the event. For vertices which pass these requirements reconstructed beyond \(r>20\) mm, the purity is greater than 95%.

As discussed in Section 3.2, an offset in the cylindrical centre of each detector layer is observed in data when compared with the simulation. To facilitate a direct comparison of the radial distribution of conversion vertices between data and simulation, the conversion vertices reconstructed in the simulation are offset by a small correction factor. Contrary to the case of Hadronic Interactions described in Section 3.2, this correction is applied to simulated vertex positions and not to the vertex positions reconstructed in data. This is motivated by the fact that the typical experimental resolution on the conversion vertex position is significantly poorer than in the case of Hadronic Interactions. Reconstructed conversion vertices corresponding to the beam pipe and IBL are visible at radii between \(20<r<28\) mm and \(30<r<40\) mm, respectively.

### Comparison of data and simulation

Figure 7 shows the radial distribution of reconstructed conversion vertices in data and simulation. The distributions for the simulated samples are normalised such that they correspond to the same number of selected events, before any photon conversion selection, as the data sample. Structures corresponding to the beam pipe and IBL are observed. The conversion vertex distribution in simulation is shown for both the default and updated geometry models. The updated geometry model exhibits improved agreement with the data due to the inclusion of additional components in the model, as described in Section 3.2.

## 5 SCT extension efficiency

The SCT extension efficiency method probes the material between the Pixel detector and the SCT, mainly due to the amount of material located in the the Pixel services region. This is the area of the Inner Detector in which a sizeable uncertainty on the material budget is there due to presence of the significant amounts of material and the complex structures.

This technique covers the range \(|\eta|<2.5\) and \(r<300\) mm. The region of \(1.5<|\eta|<2.5\) is the most interesting because it is challenging for other methods. This region contains a large amount of inactive material and complex structures which may not be perfectly described in the simulation. In particular, this method is able to probe the region of nSQPs which is not accessible with the former two methods and represents one of the biggest changes in the ID between Run 1 and Run 2, as described in Section 1. In the region \(|\eta|<1.5\) the detector geometry is relatively simple and it is expected that in this region the material is unchanged between Run 1 and Run 2. This material budget is assumed to be known with precision better than 5%.

The SCT extension efficiency method studies the rate at which Pixel track segments are extended into the SCT to build a full silicon track:

\[\text{ SCT extension efficiency}=\frac{\text{Number of Pixel track segments matched to a full track}}{\text{Total Number of Pixel track segments}}.\]

A successful extension is defined by finding a combined track matched to the Pixel track segments.

### Analysis

Event selectionTo reject fake tracks (those formed by a random combination of hits from several particles and electrical noises [9]) and to minimise the impact of background mis-modelling, the measurement needs to be performed in a phase space which limits the contribution due to non-primary particles. The Pixel track segments are selected by applying the following criteria:

* \(p_{\text{T}}>500\) MeV.
* \(|\eta|<2.5\).
* \(|d_{0}^{\text{BL}}|<2\) mm.
* \(|z_{0}^{\text{PV}}\sin(\theta)|<2\) mm.
* At least four Pixel hits.

The \(p_{\text{T}}\) and \(d_{0}^{\text{BL}}\) cuts reduce the contributions from secondary particles. This is especially important given that the rate and composition of particles originating from secondary interactions is modelled poorly in simulation, as studied in Refs. [9].

Combined tracks are required to have at least 2 SCT hits. The match between a Pixel track segment and a track is considered valid if the Pixel track segment and the track have at least one common pixel hit.

### Comparison of data and simulation

In Figure 8 the comparison of data, Pythia 8 and Epos is shown for the SCT extension efficiency as function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) of the Pixel track segments. A disagreement of the order of \(~{}1\%\) between data and simulation can be seen around \(|\eta|=2\) and a larger disagreement, up to \(~{}2.5\%\), can be observed in the region \(2.2<|\eta|<2.5\). This indicates that the simulation is not exactly describing the material in the Pixel Services regions.

A small discrepancy between the two generators can be observed as function of both \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\) of the Pixel track segments. The SCT extension efficiency as a function of \(\eta\) in Epos is \(0.15\%\) constantly lower than in Pythia 8. In addition, Epos clearly models the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) dependence much better than Pythia 8. This can be explained with the different particle composition characterizing the two generators, and can be assessed as a systematic error affecting this method. It has been demonstrated that the SCT extension efficiency is, in fact, very sensitive to particle composition. Variations in the SCT extension efficiency have been seen when selecting a specific particle type. In particular, a strong difference has been observed between Pythia 8 and Epos when excluding pions, protons and kaons from the selection. In this case, mainly strange baryons are entering the selection and the different results seen Pythia 8 and Epos are an indication of the different particle fractions predicted by the two generators.

Other sources of systematic uncertainties affecting the SCT extension efficiency measurements have been evaluated. The SCT extension efficiency as a function of \(\eta\) has been measured in different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges to study the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependence of the results. It has been found that, as expected, this aspect is strongly related to the above-mentioned particle composition: the fraction of particles predicted by the generators changes in different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges. This leads to a systematic uncertainty of the order of \(0.35\%\). In addition, the impact of fake tracks has been calculated. It has been evaluated that this contribution is \(<0.3\%\) in the full \(\eta\) range.

## 6 Conclusion

The material of the ATLAS Inner Detector is studied using several techniques based on a sample of \(pp\) collision data collected at \(\sqrt{s}=13\TeV\) in 2015. The material within the innermost regions of the ID is studied using reconstructed hadronic interactions and photon conversions. Distributions of hadronic interaction and photon conversion observables sensitive to the material distribution are reconstructed from samples of minimum bias events in data and in simulation. These studies identified issues in the material description of the IBL, which have subsequently been resolved. The updated simulation is in good agreement with the data, for both conversions and hadronic interactions. The efficiency with which pixel track segments can be matched to tracks reconstructed from hits in both silicon detectors is used to study the material between the ATLAS silicon pixel detector and semiconductor tracker. This efficiency agrees well data and simulation in the ID barrel region. Discrepancies up to 2.5% are observed in the region \(|\eta|>1.5\).
