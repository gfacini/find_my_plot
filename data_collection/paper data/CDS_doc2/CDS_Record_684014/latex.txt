necessarily unachievable; a final calibration step can be done by scaling all momenta by a factor which sets the measured \(Z\) mass to its known value. This factor will lump together all unknown effects from alignment, magnetic field and energy loss. The closer the factor is to 1 the more confidence we will have in it.

## 2 Field measurement strategy

We need a measurement strategy which could be used to determine \(\mathbf{B}\) to \(\pm 0.05\%\). This strategy is not yet fully worked out, but my aim here is to provide enough information to justify the use of NMR probes. Since the probes will be built in to the ID volume, where dimensions are now being frozen, we need to plan for them on a fairly short time scale. We need to know the space, the support brackets, the cable route, and the funding that they will require.

In a previous note [7], we proposed that the best way to measure the shape of the solenoid field is with a new or modified version of the type of machine which was used in previous experiments [6]. This machine uses an array of Hall probes, mounted on an arm which is transverse to the axis of the solenoid. The arm can be rotated around the axis and moved in the \(z\) direction to map out a three dimensional grid. A time slot for field mapping has been allowed in the ATLAS installation schedule at the moment when all the calorimeters been installed, and just before the ID is installed [5]. At this time, the mapping machine can be inserted in the ID cavity, its position surveyed, and a number of maps made and checked for consistency. The accuracy of each point in the map is expected to be better than 0.1% and by fitting the information from all of the points, and using the fact that we know div\(\mathbf{B}\)=cur\(|\mathbf{B}\)=0, we should be able to reduce the error considerably. This gives us the shape of the field and by adding an NMR probe to the mapping machine we could also get a very accurate measure of the scale. However, there is always the possibility that something might change between the time when we map the field and the time when we record the tracks.

The following effects have been considered and found to be negligible:

1. The Earth's magnetic field. Even if we ignore the shielding effect of the calorimeters this is only 1 part in \(10^{6}\).
2. The paramagnetic and diamagnetic effects of material in the inner detector. Even if the whole 5 tonnes of the inner detector was made of aluminium with \(\chi_{B}=2.3\times 10^{-5}\), the effect on the field would be only 2 parts in \(10^{6}\). In fact a whole range of materials is present in the ID and the mostly have lower \(\chi_{B}\) than aluminium.
3. Ferromagnetic material such as iron and nickel will be present in the inner detector. However, contrary to my initial estimates, the quantities are so small that the effect will be to change the average value of the field by about 1 ppm. The worst case trajectory which passes close to the largest mass of magnetic material will only be changed by 5 ppm. This is explained in much more detail in Section 5.
4. Repeatability of the current used to power the solenoid magnet. The solenoid specification [4] states that the current will be regulated to better than 1 part in \(10^{4}\).
5. Non-repeatability of the air gap between Tilecal barrel and endcaps, when the endcaps are opened and shut again. Assuming that the size of an air gap in the flux return path changes by 1 mm, then the field will change by 1 part in \(10^{4}\). In fact any change of the air gap is likely to be much less than 1 mm.

However the following may not be negligible:

1. Hysteresis of the iron components. This is probably negligible provided that the same cycle is used to switch the magnet on and off each time...
2. If we were forced to run the solenoid at a different current from the one at which it was mapped, then there would be an error in scaling the map by the ratio of the currents. CDF had exactly this problem and we should not assume that we will not.

3. The initial field map is expected to be done with the barrel toroid switched off. When the toroid is switched on, the simulation [8] predicts that the solenoid field will decrease by about 0.1%. This is because the Tilecal rails are close to saturation. When the toroid is switched on it magnetises the rails in the circumferential direction, which reduces their susceptibility to magnetisation in the \(z\) direction by the solenoid. This is larger than any of the effects above so I have checked it with a hand calculation (Section 6).

To first order, any of these effects simply scale the field without changing its shape. With an NMR probe built in near the centre of the solenoid we could measure any of these changes and apply a scale factor to the whole field map. The resulting field would be extremely precise in the barrel region and would be an improvement for the whole ID volume.

## 3 Implementation

Here we describe how such a system could be built, using as an example the instrument from Metrolab [9]. A similar system is available from Drusch [10] and there are probably others. The instrument measures the frequency of resonance of protons in the magnetic field. This frequency depends only on the magnitude of the field, \(B\), which is what we want to measure, and on the proton magnetic moment, which is known to better than 1 ppm. The accuracy of the instrument depends on the stability of its built-in frequency standard. It is claimed to be good to 5 ppm absolute and to have a drift of less than 2 ppm/year. The system would be built from the four parts described below. The cost would be about 22000 Swiss francs for the readout unit and multiplexer, plus 4200 francs for each probe with its amplifier, plus the cost of cables. The cable cost is rather uncertain at present but if we assume 300 m of cable at 25 francs per metre it comes to 7500 francs. The total cost of a system with four probes (3 installed and 1 spare) would be about 47000 Swiss francs.

### Probe Head

The probe head (part 1060-5) consists of two coils surrounding a sample of material rich in protons; eg. rubber or water. It only works if all the protons are resonating at approximately the same frequency, which sets a limit on the field non-uniformity at around 250 ppm/cm. Its dimensions are \(12.5\times 16.5\times 230\) mm and weight approximately 100 g. It also contains a bipolar transistor and a couple of diodes so it could be affected by radiation; we should test its radiation hardness.

### Amplifier

The signal must be amplified before it can be detected by the readout unit. The size of this single channel amplifier (part 1030) is \(42\times 67\times 105\) mm. It can work in a field of up to 1 T. Up to 11 m of cable is allowed between the probe and the amplifier. It is possible to buy a probe with a built-in amplifier but this would require placing the amplifier in a high radiation environment. Therefore it is best to use the seperate amplifier which could be placed at PPB2. After 10 years the radiation dose at PPB2 is expected to be \(7\times 10^{12}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\) and 15 krad. It has been reported [11] that a "non radiation hard" op-amp survived up to \(10^{14}\) neutrons/cm\({}^{2}\) and 220 krad, with a 50 % increase of noise at 80 krad. So it seems likely that this amplifier will survive at PPB2. If it should fail then it will be relatively easy to access and replace.

### Multiplexer

We will need a multiplexer (part 2030) in order to read out more than one probe. There will need to be about 50 m of cable between each amplifier and the multiplexer in order to bring all the cables around the outside of the calorimeters to a common point. The multiplexer can tolerate magnetic fields up to 1 T.

### Readout

The readout unit (part 2025) can be distant from the multiplexer, for example in a cavern which is shielded from irradiation. It can be read out into the slow control system by IEEE-488.

## 4 Number and position of probes

We should certainly use more than one probe for the sake of redundancy, because they will be among the most difficult-to-access components of the ID. The position of the probes is constrained by their need for field uniformity. Figure 2 shows how the field non-uniformity increases gradually with radius and more quickly with \(z\) as you go away from the center. We should avoid putting material at low radius, and avoid exposing the probes to higher than necessary radiation levels, implying that higher radius near \(z=0\) is best.

Earlier versions of this note proposed locating the probes at \(z=0\) in the barrel SCT where the field uniformity is better than 250 ppm/cm. However, after discussion with the manufacturer, it turns out that the probe will give an acceptable signal in a 2 T field at gradients up to 300 ppm/cm (the 250 ppm/cm specification really applies to lower fields). Therefore it is possible to locate the probes near the cryostat wall at \(z=0\), \(R=1.15\) m where there is at least 2 cm of radial space available. In this position their radiation length will have negligible effect and their cables will not add to the difficult problem of bringing services into the barrel SCT. So we propose to install three probes, equally spaced in \(\phi\) and fixed to the cryostat wall at \(z=0\). Three will allow plenty of redundancy and if none of them fail they may give some information about any asymmetry of the field in the \(\phi\) direction. To extract maximum informatin from the probe readings their position should be known to about 1 mm radially and 1 cm in \(z\).

## 5 Magnetic Materials in the Inner Detector

Although every effort is being made to avoid using ferromagnetic materials in the construction of the Inner Detector (ID), it is inevitable that in some cases there will be no suitable alternative. So we need to keep track of all the magnetic components that are proposed for use in the ID. We can use this information to estimate the expected distortion of the magnetic field caused by these componenets, and also the expected force exerted on the components by the field.

### List of components

Here all the known magnetic components are described.

* Kovar rings in the Honeywell SMV VECSEL package [12]. Kovar is an alloy of Fe(54%)/Ni(29%)/Co(17%) which is used for its compatibility with glass. The dimensions of the ring are 0.068 inches diameter \(\times\) 0.01 inches thick \(\times\) 0.005 inches wide, which gives it a volume of 0.35 mm\({}^{3}\). There are two such rings in the opto package. There is an opto package located near to each of the 4088 SCT modules and each of the 1946 Pixel modules. Total volume 4224 mm\({}^{3}\).
* Nickel coating on the ends of the SCT power tapes [13]. The last 100 mm on each end of the aluminium power tapes will be coated with a 1-2 micron layer of nickel followed by a layer of gold. The gold is necessary to make a good electrical connection and the nickel is necessary to make the gold stick to aluminium. The reason for having such a long coated region is to allow the length of the cable to adjusted to fit exactly in the space available. The necessary length can not be predicted in advance to better than 100 mm. There will be one cable end at each of the SCT modules and the other end will be at either PPB1 or PPF1. The cable width is 20 mm. Total volume 65400 mm\({}^{3}\).
* Nickel coating on the ends of the Pixel power tapes [14]. These are the same as the SCT power tapes except that the coating thickness is estimated at 1 micron and the coated length is 35 mm at the end near the modules and 100 mm at PPB1. Total volume 10 500 mm\({}^{3}\).

* Nickel coating on the connectors and the surface mount components of the forward SCT hybrid [15]. The thickness of nickel on the connectors is 1-2 microns and assuming the same thickness on all other gold plated components in the hybrid leads to an estimate of 1.1 mm\({}^{3}\) per module. We assume the same volume for barrel SCT and pixel modules. Total volume 6640 mm\({}^{3}\).
* Nickel bellows for strain relief in the Pixel cooling system [14]. Nickel is apparently the best material for these bellows but there is a possibility of using cupro-nickel instead, if magnetic field arguments require it. Each bellows is 20 mm long with 5 mm ID and 8 mm OD. The wall thickness is 25 microns and the total volume of nickel is 24 mm\({}^{3}\). There are 154 bellows near the pixel detector and another 154 at PPB1. Total volume 7400 mm\({}^{3}\).
* Stainless steel (916L) pins and cooling components in the TRT barrel [16]. As far as we know these are non-magnetic.
* Helicoil inserts in the beam pipe support plate [17], \(\mu\approx 2\).

### Average magnetization of ID volume

The simplest approximation that we can make is that all the magnetic materials are distributed uniformly through the ID volume. Furthermore, since the applied field is high we can assume that both the nickel and kovar are fully saturated. The saturation magnetisation, \(M^{\,sat}\), values are given by \(\mu_{0}\,M^{\,sat}=0.51\) T for nickel and \(\mu_{0}\,M^{\,sat}\approx 1.6\) T for kovar.

The total magnetic moment of these components, \(m_{\,tot}\), is given by the sum of each component's volume multiplied by its saturation magnetisation. The average magnetisation of the ID, \(M_{\,av}\) is the total magnetic moment divided by the total ID volume, \(V=25\,\mathrm{m}^{3}\). And the average effect of this magnetisation on the ID field, \(\Delta B_{\,av}\) is equal to \(\mu_{0}\,M_{\,av}\) or \(\sum_{i}\mu_{0}\,M_{i}^{\,sat}v_{i}\,/V\). This works out to \(\Delta B_{\,av}=2\times 10^{-6}\) T. So we see that the average effect of all the magnetic materials on the solenoid field is a negligible change of 1 ppm.

### Clumped magnetic materials

The magnetic components are confined to relatively small cylindrical volumes within the inner detector. So although their average effect on the field is negligible there might be small regions of space where it is significant. We simulate the clumping effect by assuming that the magnetic materials are uniformly distributed within the cylindrical volumes. Tables 1 and 2 list these volumes, with the amount of material in each one and the saturation magnetisation of the material. The field produced by a uniformly magnetised volume can be calculated from the equivalent surface current. This case is particularly simple because the direction of magnetisation is parallel to the axis of the cylindrical volumes, so all surfaces are either parallel or perpendicular to the magnetisation (Figure 5). It can be shown that the equivalent current per unit length, \(I/L\), is equal to the magnetisation of the volume, \(M\). Having replaced all the magnetised cylinders by currents we can then calculate the \(B\) field at any point in space by numerically integrating the Biot-Savart law. Care must be taken to avoid rounding errors in the large cancellations involved. We are really only interested in the \(z\) component of the field because this is what determines the measured track momentum. So in Figure 3 we plot \(\Delta B_{z}\) over a region of the ID which includes most of the magnetic material. It can be seen that the field is nowhere higher than 100 \(\mu\)T and that for only a fraction of any particle's trajectory, so the influence on momentum scale will be of order 1 part in \(10^{5}\) at most ( Figure 4 ).

## 6 Check of the barrel toroid effect

An analogy between a magnetic circuit and an electrical circuit can be made if one says that \(B/\mu_{0}\) is like current density, \(\mu_{r}\) is like electric conductivity and the ampere turns \(NI\) are like an applied voltage. We already know from full simulations where the field lines go, so we can calculate the dominant'resistances' in the solenoid magnetic circuit and then estimate how a small change in the tileal girder resistance will affect the field in the ID volume.

In our case the biggest resistance is the length of non-magnetic materials within the solenoid itself; \(R_{1}=l_{s}/\pi r_{s}{}^{2}\). The simulations show that there is a region covering \(\Delta z\approx 2\) m at the end of the solenoid where field lines are running approximately radially from the solenoid radius, \(r_{s}\), to the tilecal inner radius, \(r_{c}\) ; \(R_{2}=2\log(r_{c}/r_{s})/2\pi\Delta z\). When the field lines meet the tilecal they mostly continue in a radial direction to the girder at \(r_{g}\) ; \(R_{3}=2\log(r_{g}/r_{c})/\mu_{T}\,2\pi\Delta z\). The girder then carries the field lines back to the other end; \(R_{4}=l_{s}/\mu_{B}\,2\pi r_{g}t_{g}\) where \(t_{g}\) is the girder thickness. However, some field lines stay within the tilecal: \(R_{5}=l_{s}/\mu_{L}\pi(r_{g}^{2}-r_{c}^{2})\).

Neglecting saturation effects for the moment, the relative permeabilities are [8]\(\mu_{T}=4\,50\), \(\mu_{L}=30\) and \(\mu_{g}=6400\). The solenoid dimensions are \(r_{s}=1.23\) m and \(l_{s}=5.6\) m. The other dimensions are \(r_{c}=2.28\) m, \(r_{g}=4.05\) m and \(t_{g}=0.22\) m.

So the \(R\) values are \(R_{1}=1.108\), \(R_{2}=0.098\), \(R_{3}=2\times 10^{-5}\), \(R_{4}=1.5\times 10^{-4}\), \(R_{5}=5.0\times 10^{-3}\). \(R_{3}\) is so small that we neglect it. We are interested in small changes in the total resistance \(R_{T}=R_{1}+R_{2}+R_{4}R_{5}/(R_{4}+R_{5})\) due to changes in \(R_{4}\). The central field, \(B_{s}\) is related to \(R_{T}\) by \(B_{s}=\mu_{0}NI/A_{s}R_{T}\) where \(A_{s}\) is the area of the solenoid, \(\pi r_{s}^{2}\), and the design value of \(NI\) is 8.9 MA. Plugging all the numbers in gives \(B_{s}=1.94\) T. The sharing of return flux between the girder and the tilecal is in the ratio of \(R_{4}\) to \(R_{5}\), approximately 97:3. So the field in the girder is 0.97\(B_{s}A_{s}/A_{g}\) or 1.6 T, but Figure 1 shows that at this field, \(\mu_{g}\) has already fallen well below 6400, so the problem has to be solved iteratively. The solution is that 89% of the flux is in the girder where \(B_{g}\) is 1.47 T and \(\mu_{g}=1540\), the solenoid field is \(B_{s}=1.94\)\(T\). This will be the situation when the solenoid is operated with the toroids switched off.

However, the toroids produce a circumferential field of similar magnitude in the girders. This can be seen in the results of the full simulation. Alternatively, one can apply the formula for the field near a long straight wire, \(B=\mu_{0}I/2\pi r\), to the inner conductors of the toroids which are one metre away from the girder and carry a current of 3 MA. This shows that there would be a field of 0.6 T at the girder even if it was not magnetic, and the effect of its magnetism is to concentrate the field.

One way to estimate its effect is to say that it cuts down the thickness of girder available to the solenoid flux by a half. This puts the \(B_{g}\) value well into saturation. The result is that \(B_{s}\) drops by 0.16% and the girder now only carries 50% of the solenoid return flux with \(B_{g}=1.65\) T and \(\mu_{g}=3\,78\).

Another way to estimate it is to keep the whole thickness of the girder but assume a value such as 1.2 T for the toroid field and add it in quadrature to the solenoid field to find an appropriate total field from which to read off a \(\mu_{g}\) value. This approach predicts that \(B_{s}\) drops by 0.08% and the girder carries 68% of the flux, \(B_{g}\) is 1.1 T in the \(z\) direction, giving 1.6 T total and \(\mu_{g}=403\).

This very simplified model of the magnetic circuit of the solenoid confirms the order of magnitude of the toroid effect, which was predicted by a highly detailed FEA analysis to be 0.1%.

## 7 Conclusion

We have considered several possible effects which could limit the accuracy of our knowledge of the solenoid magnetic field. Many of the effects were shown to be negligible, ie. 1 part in \(10^{4}\) or less. However, one effect which will clearly be present and non-negligible is the change of about 1 part in \(10^{3}\) which occurs when the barrel toroids are turned on. Another possible significant error could be introduced if we were forced for any reason to run the solenoid at a much different current from the one which was used when the field was mapped.

Installation of a small number of NMR probes at \(z=0\) in the SCT would enable us to scale our magnetic field map, correcting the expected and any unexpected effects to an accuracy of better than 1 part in \(10^{4}\).
