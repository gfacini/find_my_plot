Beam tests of module_0 of the liquid argon Hadron End-cap Calorimeter were carried out during two periods in April and August 1998. The results of analysis of the data, obtained with electron and pion beams, are presented in this note.

Good linearity and spatial uniformity of response are observed for the electron data. The energy resolution for electron beams can be characterized by 21.5\(\pm\)0.1% sampling term, the constant term is compatible with zero.

The energy resolution for hadrons have been studied with pion beams. Monte-Carlo corrections taking into account the energy leakage are applied to determine the intrinsic resolution of the module_0. The obtained sampling and constant terms are 70\(\pm\)4% and 4\(\pm\)0.4%, correspondingly. A comparison with three simulated MC samples (GFLUKA, GCALOR, GHEISHA) is done. The most close coincidence is found with a GCALOR prediction.

The mean longitudinal and lateral shower shapes are studied for the experimental and MC samples. No strong differences are found between the experimental and all the three MC samples.

Introduction

The Hadronic End-cap Calorimeter (HEC) is a part of the ATLAS general-purpose detector [1], which is designed to carry out the physics investigations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It covers the range of 1.5\(<\eta<\)3.2 to detect hadronic showers. The HEC [2] is a liquid argon sampling calorimeter with copper absorbers. This technology is chosen to reconcile required performance characteristics, a radiation resistance and a cost-effectiveness.

The prototype modules were made and tested [3] previously to check and fix the technology of the module construction. Later several modules Zero were built, using the ready HEC module drawings, to check the expected HEC performance characteristics and to test finally the accepted construction. Only minor changes are foreseen for the serial modules in comparison with the modules Zero. The beam tests of the modules Zero were carried out in 1998. The present note is devoted to the analysis of the collected test-beam data, obtained with electron and pion beams. The main goal of the study is to understand the performance characteristics of the future calorimeter.

In section 2 the test-beam setup and the module construction are presented. The analysis procedures used are described in section 3. The results of the analysis of electron and pion data are presented in sections 4 and 5 respectively. The main results and conclusions are summarized in section 6.

## 2 Test-beam Setup

General layoutThe test-beam data are obtained in the H6 beam line of the CERN SPS. Two tested modules_0 (A and B) were placed in a cylindrical cryostat with an inner diameter of 2.5 m and a usable height of 2.2 m. Horizontal beam scans (along x coordinate axis) are enabled moving the cryostat in the limits \(\pm\)30 cm and vertical ones (along y axis) can be carried out by a beam deflection in the limits \(\pm\)25 cm at the cryostat entering window, using a bending magnet. Five multi-wire proportional chambers with 1 mm wire spacing allow precise measurements of x and y impact coordinates.

Trigger systemScintillator counters are used for a triggering. Two finger counters form a beam of 2x2 mm\({}^{2}\). Scintillator counters reject also beam particles, which are separated by a too small time interval, to prevent a signal pile-up. Two scintillator veto halos suppress interactions upstream the cryostat. Two scintillator hodoscopes are placed downstream the cryostat with a concrete/iron shielding between them. The hodoscopes work out a muon trigger.

Module descriptionA HEC module consists of front and rear submodules. Each of the two wheels of the Hadron End-cap Calorimeter [2] are formed by 32 submodules. A front (rear) submodule consists of 25(50) mm copper absorber plates and 8.5 mm liquid argon (LArg) gaps. Each gap contains one central readout electrode (PAD board) and two ElectroStatic Transformer (EST) boards, which divide the gap in four subgaps with separate High Voltage (HV) supplies. The module_0 has three longitudinal readout segments: the first (second) one includes 8(16) gaps of the front submodule, the third one includes 16 gaps of the rear submodule. The total depth of the module is about 10\(\lambda\) (\(\lambda\) - interaction length): 1.4, 2.9 and 5.7 for the 1-3 segments, correspondingly. Serial HEC modules will have four segments as the present third segment will be divided in two halves.

Readout cells are defined to be pointing in azimuth \(\phi\) and pseudorapidity \(\eta\), although projectivity in \(\eta\) is only approximate (Fig.1). The \(\eta\times\phi\) granularity of the HEC is 0.1\(\times\)0.1 at \(|\eta|\) less than 2.5 and 0.2\(\times\)0.2 at larger \(|\eta|\), so the module has two \(\phi\)-segments at \(|\eta|<\)2.5 and one \(\phi\)-segment at \(|\eta|>\)2.5.

Readout systemA gap current has a triangle time waveform with a burst rise and a much slower linear decay. The duration of the signal is equal to electron drift time across a subgap (440 ns) and the peak current \(I_{0}\) is proportional to deposited energy. The signals from different gaps, belonging to one readout cell, are preamplified with cold electronics, summed through 8 or 16 gaps and transmitted to a shaper. The shaper transforms the triangle input signal to a bi-polar signal with a peaking time of about 50 ns and with amplitude proportional to \(I_{0}\). The shaper output is sampled at 40 MHz (25ns) and digitized. The clock series, driving the sampling process, is asynchronous respectively to the time of trigger arrival. To know sample positions at a signal waveform, the time interval \(t_{TDC}\) between the trigger and the nearest succeeding clock impulse is measured, using a TDC module. The working number of samples for all the ATLAS LArg calorimeters is five and they will be placed at fixed positions around the peak of a shaping curve. But the number of samples, written down during the beam tests, is equal to 16 or 32for different data taking runs. The first four samples are always taken before the delayed signal arrival, i.e. they can be used to estimate electronics noise.

Calibration systemThe main goals of a calibration system are:

* equalization of the gains of all readout channels;
* compensation of electronics non-linearity;
* establishing of absolute ampere scale for signal measurements.

The calibration system delivers to the pads of detecting electrodes impulses of current with variable and precisely known amplitudes, established in (nano)amperes. The impulses have an exponential waveform with a decay constant chosen to maximally imitate the shower induced triangle signal. The measurements of these precise signals in a wide amplitude range are used for the electronics calibration.

Data takingThe analysed test-beam data were obtained during two data taking periods in April and August 1998. The two modules A and B were coupled to the stack, representing 1/16 of the HEC and positioned inside the cryostat. Stack orientation was chosen to minimize leakage: the front surface of modules was vertical and normal to a beam direction, the boundary plane between the modules was vertical. So, the \(\eta\)-projectivity of the readout structure was not used and it lead to the increase of the number of cells, loaded with a deposited energy, and, consequently, to the increase of noise. The modules were exposed at electron beams with energies of 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 and 119 GeV and at pion beams of the same energies and at 180 GeV. Full or shorten energy scans were done at 14 different spatial points at the surface of the stack. The points are referred further in the text with letters from A to N. The points are located approximately at the centres of the cells of the first longitudinal segment.

Several x- and y-scans with electrons and pions of fixed energies were done also. The run statistics taken at fixed energy and position is 5-10K events. Several dedicated noise runs were taken during both the periods. The randomly triggered events with no beam were written at these runs with statistics of 20K events per run.

During both the periods one subgap in the first 8 gaps of the third segment of module B was disconnected from HV because of a shortage. The same problem took place with the last 8 gaps of the second segment of module A, but only during the August period. The signal from the affected gaps was degraded by a factor of 3/4. Four cells in the third segment of module B had damaged calibration lines and no calibration was possible for them.

## 3 Analysis Procedures

Analysis goalsThe main goals of the analysis of module_0 test-beam data are:

* check the linearity of response;
* check the spatial uniformity of response;
* determine unbiased \(\alpha_{em}\) and \(\alpha_{\pi}\), coefficients transforming visible energy, measured in nA, to deposited energy in GeV scale;
* study the energy dependence of the module _intrinsic_ resolution, which can be characterized by the values of sampling (a) and constant (b) terms of the expression \[\sigma(E)/E=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus b.\] (1)

Not all these values can be measured directly, using only TB data, because they are biased by electronic noise, possible defects and energy leakage. To get unbiased values, it is necessary to apply some correction procedures, using, for instance, Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation.

The goals are different from the usual goal at physics data analysis: to reconstruct as accurate as possible the energy of each concrete particle or jet. It leads to specific features of the applied analysis procedure.

Main analysis peculiaritiesThe main of them are:

* _fixed_ tower, used for energy reconstruction, i.e. it is the same for different events and energies, although it varies, of course, for different beam impact positions. This choice simplifies the interpretation of results and their correction;* _large_ tower size to minimize the corrections, which are necessary to compensate the biases due to energy leakage out of the tower, and, therefore, to make the results less MC dependent. Some increase of electronic noise is a minor problem, if the noise can be reliably estimated and taken into account.

A criterion of cell assignment to a tower is the mean signal in the cell at some chosen energy. For pion beams the chosen energy is 180 GeV and the cell is selected, if its mean visible signal is larger 15 nA. For electron beams the corresponding values are 80 GeV and 100 nA. The characteristic size of an electron tower is 6 cells and a hadronic one is 40 cells.

Amplitude findingTo find a signal amplitude, using the measured samples, an optimal filtering (OF) procedure is used [4]. It is a \(\chi^{2}\) fit of the selected samples by a known waveform at fixed time position and the only adjustable parameter is an amplitude value. The minimization of such a \(\chi^{2}\) functional can be done analytically and the result is

\[a=\vec{w}\vec{s},\qquad\vec{w}=\frac{\hat{M}\vec{f}}{\hat{f}\hat{M}\vec{f}}, \tag{2}\]

where \(\vec{s}\) is a vector of measurements of the selected samples, \(\vec{w}\) is a vector of preliminary calculated weights, \(\vec{f}\) is a vector of waveform values, taken at the same time positions as the current samples, and \(\hat{M}\) is an inverse noise covariance matrix. As the positions of the samples at the waveform depends on \(t_{TDC}\), the weights are functions of \(t_{TDC}\): \(\vec{w}=\vec{w}(t_{TDC})\). This dependence is rather smooth and the weights are parametrized with simple polynomials of the 4th order. Not all the measured samples are used for the amplitude finding, but only five of them (from 5th to 9th), which are near the waveform maximum.

The data obtained with the calibration system are used to calculate the weights \(\vec{w}\) for all the channels.

Pedestal subtractionTo apply formula (2), it is necessary preliminary to subtract a pedestal out of the raw sample measurements. To decrease noise contribution, the averaged through a current run (5-10K events) pedestals are used. It is easy to modify formula (2) to find simultaneously the amplitude \(a\) and the pedestal \(p\) of the current signal, using only the raw sample measurements \(\vec{s}_{raw}\):

\[a=\frac{a_{1}\hat{M}\vec{u}-a_{0}\hat{M}\vec{f}}{a_{1}^{2}-a_{0}a_{2}}\cdot\vec{ s}_{raw},\]

\[p=\frac{a_{1}\hat{M}\vec{f}-a_{2}\hat{M}\vec{u}}{a_{1}^{2}-a_{0}a_{2}}\cdot\vec{ s}_{raw},\]

\[a_{0}=\vec{u}\hat{M}\vec{u},\quad a_{1}=\vec{u}\hat{M}\vec{f},\quad a_{2}=\vec{ f}\hat{M}\vec{f},\]

where \(\vec{u}\) is a vector with all unit components. But in this case the noise in a channel rises almost in two times due to the inaccuracy of the pedestal measurement, using the information from the current event only.

Usage of the pedestals averaged through all the events of a run is justified if pedestal floating during the run is small enough. Fig.2 illustrates pedestal stability during a run. Pedestal drift takes place in part of the channels, but the deviation from the mean does not exceed one ADC count. Added quadratically to characteristic noise of 3 ADC counts, such deviations practically do not increase the noise in a channel.

Noise estimate in a cellThe OF procedure suppresses electronic noise. The suppression can be characterized by a ratio \(S_{OF}=\sigma_{noise}^{OF}/\sigma_{noise}^{raw}\), where \(\sigma_{noise}^{raw}\) is the noise spread measured in a single sample and \(\sigma_{noise}^{OF}\) is the noise spread in the same readout channel after applying the OF procedure. The ratio can be measured using data from the dedicated noise runs. The width of an amplitude distribution in an electronics channel is equal to \(\sigma_{noise}^{OF}\) after applying the OF procedure to these data. The \(S_{OF}\) for all the cells of the two modules are shown in Fig.3 together with the values obtained for a muon run. The suppression factor somewhat varies from cell to cell, but on average it is equal to about 0.7. Almost all the readout channels in the muon run contains only noise and the \(S_{OF}\) values can be extracted by the same way as for the noise runs. A coincidence between the two sets of the \(S_{OF}\) is rather good, demonstrating the time stability of the ratio. Large differences for several channels, belonging to module B (Fig.3b), are really due to muon signals in the corresponding cells.

For the cells containing a non-zero signal \(\sigma_{noise}^{raw}\) can be measured using one of the first four samples, preceding the signal. Checking these values it was found that the noise level somewhat varies from run to run. To take accurately into account the noise influence it is necessary to know exactly the noise in each concrete run for each cell used. To estimate \(\sigma_{noise}^{OF}\), the directly measured in the current run \(\sigma^{raw}_{noise}\) values are used together with the \(S_{OF}\) factors, found using the data of the dedicated noise runs.

Full tower noiseTo estimate noise in a full tower the distribution of the value \(X\)

\[X=\sum_{i}^{N_{cell}}S^{i}_{OF}\cdot x^{i}_{3} \tag{3}\]

is used. Here the summation is done through all the cells of the tower, \(x^{i}_{3}\) is the third2 sample measurement for the \(i\)-th cell and the \(S^{i}_{OF}\) is the corresponding OF suppression factor. Such a distribution for a hadronic tower is shown in Fig.4 together with the results of the fit with a Gaussian curve. The distribution has a good Gaussian shape.

Footnote 2: Any of the first four samples can be used.

The method automatically takes into account possible noise correlations between cells. The resulting tower noise considerably (by 25-35%) larger than the simple quadratic sum of \(\sigma^{OF}_{noise}\), i.e. large coherent noise is present.

CalibrationTo transform the amplitude \(a_{ADC}\), measured in ADC counts, to absolute nA scale the following formula is used

\[a_{nA}=\alpha\cdot a_{ADC}+\beta\cdot a_{ADC}^{2}+\gamma\cdot a_{ADC}^{3}, \tag{4}\]

where the coefficients \(\alpha\), \(\beta\) and \(\gamma\) as well as the OF weights are found for each readout channel using calibration data. The last two terms are compensating the non-linearity of electronics chains.

Constant correction factorsThe following multiplicative correction factors are applied to cell signals

* 3rd segment, modules A and B, April and August data;
* 3rd segment, module B, April and August data;
* 2nd segment, module A, August data.

The first factor takes into account the effect of two times thicker absorber plates in the third longitudinal segment. The other two compensate _in the mean_ the effect of disconnected subgaps. They are obtained as a ratio of biased and unbiased mean responses of the corresponding segments to 180 GeV pion beam.

These corrections are used for pion data only. Electron energy is deposited mainly in the first segment and the remaining energy (10% for 120 GeV beam) is deposited in the first half of the second segment, which is not affected by the HV problems.

Resolution findingTo find the width \(\sigma\) and the maximum position \(E^{meas}\) of an energy distribution, the \(\chi^{2}\) fit of the distribution by a Gaussian curve is used. The fit is done in a limited interval \(E^{meas}\pm 2\sigma\) to reduce the influence of the distribution tails on the result. The energy resolution at a given energy is characterized by the value of \(\rho\)

\[\rho=\sigma/E^{meas}. \tag{5}\]

Scale factor \(\alpha\)The factor \(\alpha\), transforming the visible energy \(E^{vis}_{nA}\), measured in a nA scale, to the total particle energy in a GeV scale for a given beam nominal energy \(E_{0}\) is obtained as a ratio

\[\alpha(E_{0})=E_{0}/E^{meas}_{nA}. \tag{6}\]

This factor should be a constant for a given calorimeter, i.e. it should not vary in time or depend on the details of an electronics chain.

Monte-Carlo samplesThe GEANT program [5] was used to simulate event samples for a comparison with the experimental data. The geometry of the stack of the two modules was described in details, using the ATLAS geometry description package DICE [6]. Electron and pion data were simulated for each test-beam energy with the statistics of about 2K events per the energy. Three hadronic shower development packages, accessible in the framework of GEANT, were used for the simulation of pion data: GFLUKA, GCALOR and GHEISHA. The simulated samples were "spoiled", reducing properly the signals from the gaps suffered from the HV problems. The non-"spoiled" samples were retained also.

When necessary the electronic noise was superimposed. For this purpose the real events from the dedicated noise runs were used. They were added cell by cell and event by event to the MC data with a scale factor \(\kappa=\alpha_{em}/\alpha_{em}^{MC}\), transforming the noise from the nA scale to the GeV of _visible_ energy. Here\(\alpha_{em}^{MC}\) is a dimensionless ratio \(<E_{vis}^{total}>/E_{nominal}^{beam}\)=23.13\(\pm\)0.02, found using electron MC samples. The leakage of e.m. shower energy out of the selected tower amounts to 0.76% and the \(\alpha_{em}^{MC}\) includes the correction for this value.

All the procedures and program chains, which were used for the MC data analysis, are exactly the same as for the real test-beam data.

## 4 Electron Data Analysis

Energy resolutionTypical energy distributions for electron beams are shown in Fig.5 together with fit results. The energy dependence of resolution for one of the impact points (D) is shown in Fig.6. The noise is subtracted quadratically at each energy separately. The noise is somewhat different at various spatial points, but the characteristic value for a 6-8 cell tower is 0.7-0.8 GeV. A coincidence with the simulated MC data, shown at the same figure, is very good. The fit of MC data with expression (1) gives a sampling term \(a\)=21.7\(\pm\)0.5% and a constant term \(b\)=0.00\(\pm\)1.2%.

The sampling and constant terms for the test-beam data are shown in Fig.7. They are compared for both the periods at all the impact points. The constant term is compatible with zero as for the MC data. The sampling term for the April data is a bit smaller that for the August ones, but the difference is negligible. For the April data the mean sampling term is equal to \(a\)=21.5\(\pm\)0.1%.

Linearity of responseThe energy dependence of \(\alpha_{em}\) characterizes the linearity of a calorimeter response. The normalized value \(\alpha_{em}(E_{0})/\alpha_{em}\) is presented in Fig.8 for the April data. \(\alpha_{em}\) is calculated by averaging through all the energies at a given impact point. The results are obtained with (nA) and without (ADC counts) calibration. The calibration system noticeably improves the linearity, it varies in the limits \(\pm\)0.5% after applying the calibration.

The comparison of the linearity for the two periods is done in Fig.9. The calibration for the August period works somewhat worse. The non-linearity is overcorrected. It has the opposite sign in comparison with the raw ADC data (Fig.8).

Spatial uniformity of responseSpatial uniformity of response is demonstrated in Fig.10. The normalized value of \(\alpha_{em}/\langle\alpha_{em}\rangle\) is shown for different impact points. \(\langle\alpha_{em}\rangle\) is the result of averaging through all the impact points of the corresponding data-taking period. As in Fig.8 the results with and without calibration are presented. For both the periods the calibration system noticeably improves the uniformity. For the April data the deviations are within the band of \(\pm 1\%\) and for the August they are a bit larger.

Absolute calibrationThe coefficients \(\alpha_{em}\) are presented in Table 1. A systematic difference, exceeding the statistical errors, is observed between the two period values. The mean values are equal to 3.18 and 3.12 GeV/\(\mu\)A for the April and August data, correspondingly. The 0.76% energy leakage has been taken into account. The difference in absolute calibration is about 2%. It implies that there exist some problems with the calibration system or with the corresponding software procedures.

A comparison of \(\alpha_{em}(E_{0})\) for the two periods at three impact points is presented in Fig.11. The difference is approximately the same at all the energies. Therefore, the difference in the mean numbers (table 1) can not be attributed to a non-linearity influence or to the fact that somewhat different sets of energies are used for averaging.

## 5 Hadron Data Analysis

Experimental energy resolutionSeveral pion energy distributions are shown in Fig.12 together with the results of fits. The fits have acceptable \(\chi^{2}\)'s but the distributions are slightly asymmetrical due to enhanced low energy tails.

Only one half (the first one) of the 3rd segment of module B has lowered sensitivity because of the HV problems. But even at the highest energy of 180 GeV less than 20% of the energy is deposited in the third segment. The third segment is the thickest one. It contains about 60% of the whole absorber and the most part of the deposited energy is located in its first

\begin{table}

part. This is why the fixed correction in the mean, described in section 3, is sufficient to restore the energy resolution. There is no meaningful difference between the resolutions of modules A and B for the April period (table 2). The different situation is for module A in the August period, during which the second part of its second segment had a lowered sensitivity. The most part of particle energy is deposited in this segment and the sharing of the energy between its halves is strongly fluctuating. The applied correction in the mean is insufficient to restore the resolution and the resolution of module A is unrecoverably spoiled for the August period. This correction is mainly aimed to correct weak signals on the periphery of the showers developing in module B.

In contrast to the electron data the pion resolution considerably varies for different impact points because of energy leakage. The data for points D, E, H and I, which are relatively far from the stack outer boundaries, are presented in table 2.

The results of fits by the expression (1) are listed in table 3. As for the electron analysis the noise is subtracted at each energy point. The mean values of the noise, which are about 5-6 GeV, are presented in the table also.

A comparison of the energy dependence of the resolution with MC predictions is made in Fig.13. The data for point I from the April period are used. The experimental points lie between GHEISHA and GCALOR predictions, but noticeably closer to the GCALOR one. The FLUKA samples demon

The mean energy leakage out of the overall stack \(E_{lk}\) and its r.m.s.3 at 180 GeV are listed also for the MC samples. The r.m.s. gives a contribution to the degradation of the resolution due to the leakage. The influence of leakage is approximately the same for all the three models.

Footnote 3: The \(E_{lk}\)-distribution has a very long tail. To minimize its influence, the truncated distribution with \(E_{cut}\)=30 GeV is used to calculate the listed values.

Intrinsic energy resolutionThe obtained numbers can not be considered as the characteristics of the intrinsic resolution of the module_0 because they are affected by the energy leakage and at a less extension by the HV problems in the 3rd segment. To estimate the influence of the HV problems it is sufficient to compare the results for modules A and B in the April or the results for "spoiled" and non-"spoiled" MC samples. Both the comparisons

show that the worsening of the resolution is negligible, within the statistical error limits.

To take into account the influence of the leakage on the resolution, it is necessary to know the resolution, \(\rho_{ideal}(E_{0})\), for the "ideal" calorimeter, when all the incident energy is absorbed. The \(\rho_{ideal}(E_{0})\) is estimated using MC samples, for which the exact energy leakage, \(E_{leak}\), is known for each particular event:

\[\rho_{ideal}(E_{0})=\langle\sigma(E_{dep})/E_{dep}\rangle, \tag{7}\]

where \(E_{dep}=E_{0}-E_{leak}\) is the deposited energy and averaging is done through all \(E_{dep}\) range at the current \(E_{0}\). In practice, the _total_ visible energy (but not inside the tower only) for each event is multiplied by the correction factor \(E_{0}/E_{dep}\), to bring events with different \(E_{dep}\) to one scale, and the obtained energy distribution is fitted to find the "ideal" resolution and the "ideal" ratio \(\alpha_{\pi}^{MC,idl}\).

The "spoiled" MC resolution and the "ideal" one are quadratically subtracted one from the other to find a degradation factor \(\rho_{deg}(E_{0})\), which is shown in Fig.14 for GFLUKA, GCALOR and GHEISHA at all the test-beam energies. All the three sets of points coincides within the error bar limits notwithstanding the predictions for \(\rho_{ideal}(E_{0})\) itself differ considerably. This is due to the rather moderate absolute value of \(\rho_{deg}(E_{0})\). When a smaller tower size is used, \(\rho_{deg}(E_{0})\) increases and the predictions of different MC codes became divergent.

To estimate the intrinsic resolution of module_0 \(\rho_{deg}(E_{0})\) is subtracted quadratically from the experimental values at each the energy point. The results of fit by expression (1) are listed in the following table together with the "ideal" MC predictions:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline sample & a (\%) & b (\%) & \(\alpha_{\pi}^{MC,idl}\) \\ \hline exp. & 70.0\(\pm\)4.0 & 4.0\(\pm\)0.40 & — \\ \hline GFLUKA & 43.7\(\pm\)1.1 & 2.34\(\pm\)0.23 & 24.9 \\ \hline GCALOR & 62.6\(\pm\)1.6 & 3.67\(\pm\)0.31 & 26.2 \\ \hline GHEISHA & 85.1\(\pm\)2.1 & 4.44\(\pm\)0.44 & 28.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Absolute calibration

A comparison of \(\alpha_{\pi}(E_{0})\) for the April and August periods is presented in Fig.15 for two impact points E and I. The difference between the two periods is approximately the same at all the energies, but it amounts to about 5% in contrast to 2% for electron data, confirming existence of some problems with the calibration.

e/h ratioThe important intrinsic characteristic of a calorimeter is mean efficiency of electron (\(e=E_{vis}/E_{beam}\equiv\alpha_{em}^{-1}\)) and hadron (\(h\)) detection. The value \(h\) can be defined as \(h=E_{vis}^{had}/E_{dep}^{had}\), where both the visible and the deposited energies refer to only the _hadronic_ part of shower energy, i.e. all energy not carried away by \(\pi^{0}\) production and decay. The deviation of a \(e/h\) ratio out of unit for non-compensating calorimeters leads to the worsening of the intrinsic resolution and gives rise to a constant term \(b\) (eq. 1). \(e\) and \(h\) are approximately energy independent values in contrast to pion detection efficiency \(\pi\equiv\alpha_{\pi}^{-1}\). The latter is a weighted average of \(e\) and \(h\) and the averaging weights depend on the electromagnetic/hadronic fraction in the shower contents, which depends on the energy of a primary pion. \(e/h\) and the experimentally measurable \(e/\pi\) ratios are related by the following equation [7]

\[e/\pi=\frac{e/h}{1+(e/h-1)\cdot f_{\pi^{0}}}, \tag{8}\]

where \(f_{\pi^{0}}\) is the mean fraction of the initial pion energy deposited through electromagnetic cascades. \(f_{\pi^{0}}\) is a slowly rising function of the pion energy, which can be parametrized as

\[f_{\pi^{0}}=1-\left(\frac{E}{E_{0}^{\prime}}\right)^{m-1}, \tag{9}\]

where \(E_{0}^{\prime}\approx\)1 GeV for pions and \(m\approx\)0.85. \(m\) depends on the very general properties of hadron-nucleus interactions and it should not depend in the first approximation on the construction of a calorimeter. Different fits of \(m\) give the value in range of 0.83-0.86 [8].

The experimentally measured \(e/\pi\) ratio is shown in Fig.16a as well as the results of a fit by eq. (8). The April data for impact point I are used. But these results are certainly biased by energy leakage outside the selected tower and calorimeter. The Monte-Carlo correction factor, shown at the same figure, should be applied to get unbiased results. The factor is obtained, using the "spoiled" GCALOR samples and the extrapolation to the "ideal" GCALOR as it is described above. The factor has a weak energy dependence and amounts to about 1.05. The corrected data are shown in Fig.16b. The resulting \(e/h\) ratio is rather sensitive to the input \(e/\pi\): the change of 0.05 in \(e/\pi\) leads to the change of 0.2 in \(e/h\). The applied correction considerably improves \(\chi^{2}\) also. The fit results for the other impact points are shown here:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline point & \(e/h\) & \(\chi^{2}/ndf\) \\ \hline D & 1.62 \(\pm\) 0.006 & 41.8/6 \\ \hline E & 1.58 \(\pm\) 0.007 & 27.7/6 \\ \hline H & 1.59 \(\pm\) 0.006 & 20.9/6 \\ \hline I & 1.60 \(\pm\) 0.006 & 21.2/5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The correction factor obtained for point I is applied for all the other points and this can induce some systematic error at these points. \(e/h\) varies in the limits from 1.58 to 1.62 indicating that systematic errors are dominating over the statistical ones.

The results obtained with the August data at point E are presented in Fig.17. The \(e/\pi\) ratio is systematically lower for the August data and somewhat flatter than the April one. The obtained value of \(e/h\) is 1.46\(\pm\)0.004 and \(\chi^{2}\) is unacceptably large. The fit results for the other points are:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline point & \(e/h\) & \(\chi^{2}/ndf\) \\ \hline E & 1.46 \(\pm\) 0.004 & 149/7 \\ \hline I & 1.48 \(\pm\) 0.004 & 116/7 \\ \hline N & 1.45 \(\pm\) 0.004 & 159/7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

It can be concluded that \(e/h\) ratio is very sensitive to some systematic effects, which vary its value by 0.1-0.2. They affect also the absolute nA-to-GeV scale factor. More detailed study of the effects is required. In particular, the systematic comparison of hadron, electron and calibration waveforms at the different levels of a signal is necessary.

The results obtained for the "ideal" MC prediction are listed here:

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline model & \(e/h\) & \(m\) & \(\chi^{2}/ndf\) \\ \hline GFLUKA & 1.176 \(\pm\) 0.0015 & 0.85 & 9.8/7 \\ \cline{2-4}  & 1.179 \(\pm\) 0.006 & 0.847 \(\pm\) 0.007 & 9.7/6 \\ \hline GCALOR & 1.316 \(\pm\) 0.002 & 0.85 & 11.0/7 \\ \cline{2-4}  & 1.324 \(\pm\) 0.008 & 0.846 \(\pm\) 0.004 & 10.5/7 \\ \hline GHEISHA & 1.607 \(\pm\) 0.005 & 0.85 & 65.9/7 \\ \cline{2-4}  & 1.748 \(\pm\) 0.02 & 0.821 \(\pm\) 0.003 & 45.3/6 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The fits with fixed and free exponential parameters \(m\) are done. For GFLUKA and GCALOR the fitted value of \(m\) is compatible with the used for the experimental fits 0.85 value.

Adjustable correction factorsThe pion energy resolution can be improved using additional multiplicative correction factors \(C_{j}\) assigned to each longitudinal segment. They are found minimizing the following functional at a given beam energy:

\[F=\sum_{i}^{N_{events}}(E_{0}-E_{meas}^{i})^{2},\qquad E_{meas}^{i}=\sum_{j}^{3 }C_{j}\cdot\alpha_{\pi}\cdot E_{vis}^{ij}, \tag{10}\]

where \(E_{vis}^{ij}\) is the energy detected in the \(j\)-th segment in the \(i\)-th event.

The factors are found using only high energy data (120 and 180 GeV) and applied at all the energies.

The results for point I are presented in tables 4 and 5. The improvement is rather moderate: the sampling term is practically unchanged, but the constant term decreases by 0.6% only.

Energy dependent adjustable correction factorsThe same factors can be found and applied at each energy separat

sented in tables 4 and 5 also. At the lowest energies the factors diminish the signal from the third segment to suppress its large noise contribution to the experimental resolution. But after noise subtraction the obtained resolution is approximately the same as in the previous case and even a bit worse at the lowest energies. Therefore, the energy dependent \(C_{i}\) are unable to improve the intrinsic resolution and it is sufficient to use only three energy independent \(C_{i}\).

Mean longitudinal shower profileEnergy sharing between the longitudinal segments is illustrated in Fig.18. The value, shown as a function of energy, is a ratio of the mean energy deposited in a segment to the total deposited energy, i.e. the sum of the three values at each energy is equal to one by definition. The distributions depend directly on the longitudinal profiles of hadronic showers.

A fraction of the energy deposited in the third segment is rising noticeably in the studied energy range but even at the highest energy of 180 GeV it amounts of about 15% only. The Monte-Carlo predictions are also shown in the figure. They are rather close to each other and to the experimental data with a bit better coincidence for the GCALOR prediction.

Mean lateral shower profileThe size of a HEC cell is relatively large in respect to the characteristic lateral size of a hadronic shower. Thus to study the mean lateral profile of a hadronic shower in details the data of a horizontal x-scan are used. The x-scan was done with a 2 cm step using 120 GeV pion beam. For this study the cells of each segment are unified in four vertical strips (two per module), each of which corresponds to one \(\phi\)-segment of the HEC. Strips 1,2 (3,4) belong to module A (B). Only the cells corresponding to \(|\eta|<\)2.5 are used. The mean response of the four strips is shown in Fig.19 as a function of the x-coordinate of a beam impact point for the three longitudinal segments. All the plots are renormalized to unit at the maximum of the response of the 2nd strip (marked with an arrow) for the convenience of a comparison with MC results.

The shower is considerably more compact in the 1st longitudinal segment and the response of the outer strips 1 and 4 varies by the three orders of value. A noticeable enhancement is clearly distinguishable in the response of strip 1 (4) in the region of small negative (positive) \(x\). This is, obviously, due to electronics crosstalk. The most strong signal in this region is in strip 2 (3), which belongs to the same module A (B). It is almost by two orders of value greater than the signal in strip 1 (4) and the small signal, induced by it, is comparable with the own signal of strip 1 (4). The enhancement is absent at the positive (negative) \(x\), indicating that the crosstalk between the electronics of different modules is absent. The difference of a signal level between strips 1 and 2 (3 and 4) is only about one order of value in this region and the crosstalk influence can be neglected. The effect is maximal for the first segment due to the narrower shower shape there and, therefore, larger difference in the signal level between the strips at fixed \(x\).

The MC samples were simulated for module A x-scan (negative \(x\)). A comparison of the MC data with the experimental ones is shown in Fig.20. Strips 3 and 4 are used for the comparison to reduce the influence of the crosstalk. There is no any significant difference between the different MC predictions and between the experimental and MC data. It can be concluded that all the three MC shower development codes describe the lateral shower shape satisfactory as well as the longitudinal one.

## 6 Conclusions

The beam tests of the Module Zero of the ATLAS Hadron End-cap Calorimeter have been carried out and the following conclusions can be drawn:

* cell responses to electrons in the first segment are equalized with precision better than \(\pm\)1% after applying the calibration procedure;
* the linearity of response to electrons in the range from 20 upto 120 GeV is in the limits \(\pm\)0.5%;
* the energy dependence of the module energy resolution for electrons can be characterized by a sampling term of 21.5\(\pm\)0.1% and a constant term is compatible with zero. The result coincides perfectly with the GEANT Monte-Carlo prediction;
* the energy dependence of the intrinsic resolution for pions can be described by a sampling term of 70\(\pm\)4% and a constant term of 4.0\(\pm\)0.5%;
* the calibration system improves both the linearity of response and the cell to cell uniformity of response. Nevertheless some uncertainty in a few percent exists in the absolute calibration scale. It biases also \(e/\pi\) ratio. The further study of the effect is necessary.

A comparison of the experimental results with Monte-Carlo predictions have been done also. Three hadronic shower development packages have been used: GFLUKA, GCALOR and GHEISHA. The results of the comparison can be formulated as:

* the experimental resolution lies between the GHEISHA and GCALOR predictions, rather close to the latter one. The resolution predicted by GFLUKA is much better than the experimentally observed one;
* longitudinal and lateral mean shower shapes are rather similar for all the MC predictions and experimental data;
* large difference in the predicted \(e/h\) ratio takes place: 1.18, 1.32 and 1.61 for GFLUKA, GCALOR and GHEISHA, correspondingly.
