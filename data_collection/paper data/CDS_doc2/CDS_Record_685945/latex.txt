**Optimization of the forward SCT layout**

_Allan Clark_ and _Alan Poppleton_

## 0 Introduction

An alternative SCT layout _[1]_, offering complete coverage of the inner detector rapidity range, was proposed as a back-up solution to the MSGC forward detectors following a request from the Inner Detector Review Panel. This design fulfilled the performance specifications _[2]_ by providing 4 SCT hits in the space between the pixel layers (unchanged from the base-line design) and the TRT (slightly modified to include the region formerly occupied by the large MSGC end-wheels). The main features of this layout (shown conceptually as Figure 23 in the Technical Proposal) were:

* the introduction of 18 SCT wheels to replace the 26, base-line, MSGC wheels
* the concentration of silicon strip detectors into the radial range from 0.30 to 0.54m to permit standardization upon a 120mm strip length -- with a consequent reduction in the outer radius and length of the barrel SCT
* the provision of an 'ear' out to R\(=\)0.60m on the first wheel in each direction to provide sufficient hits in the barrel/forward transition region
* the extension of the last wheel out to R\(=\)0.60m to improve the momentum resolution at high rapidities
* the provision of inward extensions on 6 of the wheels to give sufficient hits at high rapidity, necessitating GaAs technology to access the smaller radii
* the grouping of the silicon detectors into a cylindrical volume with length 5.5m and radius 0.6m to simplify the engineering of the mechanical supports, cooling system and installation procedure
* a possible complementary reduction to the length and inner radius of the barrel TRT was introduced in the Technical Proposal to improve the TRT barrel/forward overlap.

The purpose of this note is to propose two improved forward SCT layouts which rectify some of the disadvantages perceived with both the base-line and back-up layouts presented in the Technical Proposal. Work will continue, in conjunction with the SCT community, to combine their most attractive features into a single design. The aim is to provide uniform performance across the rapidity range: for momentum and impact parameter resolutions, for the second level track trigger and, in particular, for discrete tracker pattern recognition capability. The forward silicon detector geometry (pitch, number of read-out channels etc.) is treated in greater detail than previously. A preliminary cost evaluation is also included.

### 2.0 Layouts

Basic design goals in the forward direction are:

1. **Robust pattern recognition** -- by providing sufficient and approximately evenly spaced points. The original design followed the performance specifications by aiming for at least (and wherever possible at most) 4 SCT hits. This was satisfied by providing hit continuity between the barrel and forward regions, which resulted in an unequal spacing of the layers. A more equal spacing is desirable for robust pattern recognition -- especially at high rapidities where the TRT contribution is minimal. For example, when \(|\eta|\)\(<\)1.9 more than 40% of the inner detector track length lies inside the TRT, however this falls to almost zero by \(|\eta|\)=2.5. A study _[3]_ of the discrete tracker stand-alone pattern recognition capabilities for narrow jets (\(\tau\)\(>\)3-prongs) using a previous layout (the so-called panel design) showed a marked deterioration in track-finding efficiency going outwards from the barrel towards high rapidity. It is proposed to partially compensate by adding an extra discrete track point at extreme rapidities.
2. **Acceptance** -- respect the specifications by providing sufficient points out to \(\eta\)=2.5 from a 2\(\sigma\) displaced vertex (i.e. from Z=0.112m). Since the radiation doses have significantly increased in the forward region (following the adoption of the integrated forward calorimeter _[4, 5]_), it is desirable to retain sensitivity along \(|\eta|\)=2.5 with a minimal radiation increase when compared to the barrel region.
3. **Performance** -- improve the momentum resolution for \(|\eta|\)\(>\)2.0, since both base-line and back-up layouts fail to satisfy the technical specifications. A more uniform behaviour is preferable for the SCT stand-alone impact parameter measurement and second-level trigger threshold, in particular for the region with 1.6\(<\)\(|\eta|\)\(<\)2.0 where the base-line performance deteriorates due to the absence of any intermediate hit (in the vicinity of R=0.30m).
4. **Engineering convenience** -- to remain inside the TRT for engineering convenience (i.e. R\(<\)0.6m and Z\(<\)2.75m). The barrel detector is assumed to have 2 barrel pixel layers and 4 crossed stereo layers at radii 0.30, 0.38, 0.46 and 0.54m as described in the technical proposal. Its length of 1.52m constrains the forward detector to start at Z=0.84m.
5. **Technology choice** -- to use silicon strips for R\(>\)0.30m, and with less certainty on the radial boundaries: GaAs strips for 0.30m\(>\)R\(>\)0.17m and pixels for 0.10m\(<\)R\(<\)0.20m. A finer granularity is required at the smaller radii to ensure reasonable occupancy values.

A natural solution to the first two items is to start by aligning the inner active radius of the forward disks to the line of limiting acceptance, with the disks stepping in radius according to their radial granularity. This line is summarized in Table 1.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|l|} \hline
**R (m)** & **Z (m)** & **Technology** \\ \hline
0.10 & 0.717 & pixel disk (in barrel) \\
0.12 & 0.838 & pixel (first SCT forward wheel) \\
0.17 & 1.141 & GaAs disk \\
0.235 & 1.534 & \\
0.30 & 1.927 & Silicon disk \\
0.36 & 2.290 & \\
0.42 & 2.653 & \\
0.48 & 3.016 & forbidden as overlaps the TRT! \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: **Line of limiting acceptance (\(\eta\)=2.5)**It follows that the last disk should have an inner radius of 0.42m to remain inside the TRT boundary, thus there will be 7 points per track at \(\eta\)=1=2.5. Furthermore, it is proposed to move the last 2 wheels out to Z=2.34 and 2.75m to take advantage of the available space.

For the first layout shown below, the stereo wheels extend outwards to R=0.60m, whereas the pixel layers remain at their Technical Proposal values. The layout is complemented by 3 additional silicon wheels (with 0.30\(<\)R\(<\)0.60m) to give sufficient hits at intermediate rapidities. Coming inwards from extreme \(\eta\), the addition of wheel4 at Z=1.338m provides hit continuity with wheel7 at \(\eta\)\(\sim\)2.0, similarly wheel2 (Z=0.979m) picks up from wheel6 at \(\eta\)\(\sim\)1.8 and wheel1 (Z=0.840m) takes over from wheel5 at \(\eta\)\(\sim\)1.6. Somewhat fortuitously, wheels 1, 2, 3 and 4 are ideally placed to provide forward extensions to the barrel layers at radii 0.54, 0.46, 0.38 and 0.30m respectively.

A feature of the above layout is that the silicon is divided radially into 3 strips of length 60, 120 and 120 mm going outwards. This improves the occupancy situation, but is not ideal from standardization and financial viewpoints. The second layout under consideration (shown below) should be cheaper as the silicon wheels extend to R=0.54m, requiring only two 120mm radial strips.

Other features distinguishing this second layout are:

* an additional GaAs extension to wheel 1 to provide hit continuity below \(\eta\)\(\sim\)2.1.
* a 60mm 'ear' on wheel 1 to bridge to the barrel layer at R =0.54m.
* an additional 'half-wheel' (0.42\(<\)R\(<\)0.54m) is inserted at Z=0.915m to bridge between the barrel R=0.46m layer and the wheel at Z=1.534m. To accommodate this, the subsequent wheel is moved to Z=0.99m.
* wheel5 (in this layout) is at Z=1.278m to bridge from the barrel layer at R=0.30m to the wheel at Z=1.93m, rather than putting it at Z=1.338m as desired for equal spacing.
* modifications to the third and fourth end-cap pixel layers to follow the \(\eta\)=2.5 line, putting them at Z=0.77m and Z=0.84m, with radial coverage of 0.10\(<\)R\(<\)0.20m and 0.12\(<\)R\(<\)0.17m respectively.

However, as illustrated below, both layouts fulfil the specified number of track hits, and in this respect are superior to the base-line layout, especially for the barrel/forward transition region and at large \(|\eta|\). The ear in the second layout avoids a similar dip to the one seen with the base-line Technical Proposal layout at \(|\eta|\)\(\sim\)1.2.

### Detector Geometry

All forward silicon modules are assumed to have a keystone geometry, with an outside dimension of 69mm to maximize yield rather than mechanical convenience. Thus a different number of modules is required in each radial ring, which prevents them from lining up in sectors. However the strip pitch is kept as close as possible to a continual fan arrangement, subject to the read-out constraint of modulo 128 channels per wafer. Tables 2 and 3 summarize the geometry of the forward SCT strip detectors for the two layouts. The GaAs pitch is taken to continue inwards from the R\(=\)0.54m silicon without any consideration of wafer size or module construction. The average pitch of 58\(\upmu\)m is slightly wider than the constant 50\(\upmu\)m quoted in the Technical Proposal. This results in a slight performance degradation as shown in the following section.

The necessary quantities of silicon and electronics are compared in Table 4. In addition, the extra GaAs wheel and reduced pixel area of the R\(=\)0.54m layout should also be taken into account.

### Performance

The performance of these two layouts has been evaluated, and contrasted with the base-line Technical Proposal layout, using the procedure described in [6]. This procedure allows for the effect of the inhomogeneous solenoidal magnetic field, and averages over the longitudinal intersection region assuming a Gaussian distribution. There is a further development to include keystone geometry by varying the transverse precision in proportion to the pitch taken at the radius of the track intercept. To permit a consistent comparison, this is applied retrospectively to the GaAs detectors for the base-line layout (including the 58\(\upmu\)m average pitch), although the MSGC resolution is maintained at 35\(\upmu\)m independent of radius.

The plot below shows the high-energy limit of the impact parameter resolution obtained at the beam-axis using the SCT stand-alone (including the pixels but not the B-physics vertexing layer). Adding the TRT makes a significant improvement up to \(|\eta|\)\(\sim\)2.0 (especially to smoothing the distribution obtained with the Technical Proposal layout). However, in most cases of physics interest, tracks from b-jets are dominated by Coulomb scattering, thus the benefit from following the track through additional material is minimal. The 'bump' at \(|\eta|\)\(\sim\) 1.8 in the Technical Proposal distribution arises from fitting a curved trajectory (3 parameters) to 6 space points which are concentrated into only 2 clusters -- pixels and MSGC. The proposed layouts demonstrate a noticeable loss of precision in the barrel region with respect to the Technical Proposal. This is due to the decrease in SCT barrel radius. However their overall performance is more uniform, with little difference between them. The R=0.60m layout is slightly better in the barrel/forward transition region, while the performance benefit of spacing the end-cap pixels is only apparent at extreme \(\eta\).

The momentum resolution, calculated using only the vertex constraint and SCT strip layers as in the second-level track trigger, is shown below. Since the relevant number of track points averages around 4 by design, downward fluctuations from extreme vertex and \(\eta\)-values can lead to insufficient hits to measure momentum. The question of how to represent this trigger inefficiency on the plot has been avoided by restricting the range to \(\eta\)\(<\)2.48 and performing the vertex averaging over only 2\(\sigma\) on either side of the origin. The \(\eta\)-dependence of the trigger threshold illustrates the same general behaviour as already discussed for the impact parameter distribution. The advantages of equal spacing are even more pronounced. For comparison with the second-level algorithm described in [7], the resolution should be degraded by around a factor 2 -- to account for the trigger using only \(\phi\)-layers rather than space points and the simplified trigger read-out assumed.

The overall momentum resolution at p\({}_{\rm T}\)=500 GeV is shown in the following plot, now with full vertex averaging, and including the vertex constraint, pixel and TRT detectors. There is very little \(\eta\)-dependence or difference between the layouts for \(|\eta|\)\(<\)1.9. At higher rapidities the resolution falls due to reverse-bending in the solenoid fringe field and the decreasing radial track length to the TRT measurements. The base-line layout demonstrates the advantage of the extra track length available up to the large MSGC end-wheel. Because the final SCT wheel has been taken to have double electronics (i.e. half the strip pitch), the SCT resolution improves substantially at the highest rapidity to become better than the base-line resolution. Of course this effect is apparent about 0.1 rapidity unit lower with the R=0.60m layout because of the wheel's larger radial coverage. However the practicability of this approach and the influence of alignment errors remain to be studied. Conversely the penultimate wheel could also be given finer granularity, if the physics benefit of a more precise momentum resolution justifies the additional expense. The momentum resolution at \(|\eta|\)=2.5 is almost 70% for the base-line layout and around 55% for the SCT alternatives.

### Costing

Preliminary costings have been evaluated using digital electronic read-out -- purely because this is approximately the middle price estimate for the different options. Wherever appropriate an extra 20% has been included to allow for wastage. Some small additional cooling and mechanics costs needed to provide the ear in the second layout have been neglected. When comparing the silicon costs tabulated below, the additional GaAs wheel and reduced pixel area of the second layout should also be remembered.
