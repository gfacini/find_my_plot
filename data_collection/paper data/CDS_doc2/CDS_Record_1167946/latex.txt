**Abstract**

The decay processes \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0\ast}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) are expected to be observed in large numbers with the ATLAS experiment. During the early data taking period, with an integrated luminosity of around \(\sim 10-150\) pb\({}^{-1}\), it will be possible to measure the masses and proper lifetimes for these decays with sufficient precision to allow them to be used for detector performance checks. Methods for the determination of the mass and lifetime when the performance of the detector and reconstruction software will not be fully understood are presented. A powerful simultaneous fitting technique is used. Understanding the potential for flavour tagging methods will be one of the important goals for \(B\)-physics with early data. The performance of the jet charge tagger for the self-calibrating decay, \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0\ast}\), is presented. The implications for the jet charge tag in the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) decay are also discussed.

Introduction

The decay \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) is one of the most promising channels at the LHC due to its rich physics potential. This will begin with the earliest data taken by ATLAS. Due to the high \(b\bar{b}\) cross-section [1] and dedicated \(J/\psi\) trigger in ATLAS [2], large statistics data will be quickly accumulated. This will allow the channel to be used for basic measurements of the \(B\) mass and lifetime, which will provide a sensitive test of the understanding of the tracking system after only 150 pb\({}^{-1}\) of data. After collecting only 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, ATLAS will begin to improve world precisions for these measurements. A similar analysis will also be performed for the channel \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\), where the expected statistics are higher by about a factor of 15.

The analysis methods to be used will evolve with increasing statistics and understanding of the detector and backgrounds. This paper concentrates on the early phase of data taking. More advanced studies of the angular dependence of the decays and CP violation are not covered. In the very early data taking period, the low statistics will not allow an investigation of the full list of theoretical parameters, but rather will concentrate on the mass and lifetime. As the backgrounds will not be well understood either, no hard cuts will be made to reject them, but rather backgrounds topologically similar to the signal will be admitted. This will also reduce the dependence on reconstruction algorithms and trigger behaviour, neither of which will be thoroughly tested when ATLAS starts to take data. In particular, no secondary vertex displacement cuts will be applied, and the dominant background admitted will be from direct \(J/\psi\) production.

The simulation of the decays and their backgrounds is described in Section 2, and the reconstruction of the events in Section 3. The methods developed to extract the \(B\) hadron mass and lifetime as well as the precision expected to be reached with early data are described in Section 4. A study of the possibilities for flavour-tagging with early data, an important initial step for the CP violation measurements to be done later, is presented in Section 5.

## 2 Monte Carlo production

Table 1 lists the Monte Carlo data samples used in this study. The beauty events were generated by PYTHIA 6.4 [3] using a method described in [4]. For the direct \(J/\psi\) decays a special tuning of the Colour Octet Model was prepared within PYTHIA [5]. In order to make the simulation studies more efficient the initial cuts on the transverse momentum, \(p_{T}\), and the pseudorapidity, \(\eta\), were applied at the generator level. To ensure that most of the generated events passed the trigger at the reconstruction stage, only events containing decays of \(J/\psi\) into dimuons, with \(p_{T}\) larger than 6 GeV and 4 GeV, both detected within \(|\eta|<2.4\), were retained for detector simulations.

## 3 Analysis of the decays \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\)

### Strategy for analysis of early data

The strategies deployed during the early period of the experiment will differ from those used later. In particular, the low statistics available will not allow a determination of the complete list of physics variables that can in principle be determined from the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) decays [6]. During the early phase, the compositions of the backgrounds will not be well understood. Furthermore, at this time, the detector and reconstruction software performance will also not be fully understood, and restrictive selection cuts to remove backgrounds may bias the signal in an uncontrolled way. The strategy in these early stages will therefore be to use loose cuts, which will admit more of the background decays. In particular, omitting vertex selections allows a statistically meaningful contribution from prompt \(J/\psi\) events. Most of these events fall outside the signal region of the study, and allow a better determination of the vertex resolution, which in turn allows a better overall \(B\) lifetime determination. This approach is consistent with the \(B\) trigger strategy for early data where no cut on secondary vertex displacement is required.

### Reconstruction

Monte Carlo events of signal and background processes, as described in Table 1, were passed through full detector simulation and reconstruction. Trigger algorithms were applied during the reconstruction. Only events accepted by the \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) trigger [2] (with thresholds of \(p_{T}>6\) GeV and \(p_{T}>4\) GeV for the fastest and second fastest muon) were retained for offline analysis. The reconstructed data objects were then processed as follows.

\(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) candidates were sought by forming all possible pairs of oppositely charged muon tracks passing the cuts \(p_{T}>4\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.4\). Pairs containing at least one muon track with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV were fitted to a common vertex. Pairs were assumed to be muons from \(J/\psi\) decays if the vertex fit resulted in a fit \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f<6\) and the invariant mass of the muon pair fell within a 3 \(\sigma\) window around the nominal \(J/\psi\) mass, with \(\sigma=58\) MeV. This window was chosen by fitting a Gaussian distribution to the invariant mass of the muon pairs in the events \(pp\to J/\psi X\) and \(bb\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}X\), see Figure 1. The background from non resonant \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pairs in the 3 \(\sigma\) window is 10%.

The \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\) candidates were reconstructed from all pairs of oppositely charged tracks, not identified as muons, with \(p_{T}>0.5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), which were fitted to a common vertex. These trackswere assumed to be kaons from \(\phi\) decays if the vertex fit resulted in a \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f<6\), and the invariant mass of the track pairs (under the assumption that they were left by kaons) fell within the interval \(1009.2-1029.6\)\(\mathrm{\,Me\kern-1.0ptV}\). This interval is based on a fit to the invariant mass distribution of the reconstructed \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\) decay candidates shown in Figure 1. The signal fit used a Breit-Wigner correctly accounting for phase space convoluted with a Gaussian to represent the detector resolution. The background was approximated by a linear function. (Additional terms up to quadratic have no significant influence on the fit.)

The \(K^{0*}\to K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}\) candidates were reconstructed by selecting all tracks that had \(p_{T}>0.5\)\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) that had not been previously identified as muons, forming them into oppositely charged pairs and fitting them to a common vertex. These pairs were assumed to be \(K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}\) from \(K^{0*}\) decays if the fit resulted in a \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f<6\), the transverse momentum of the \(K^{0*}\) candidate was greater than 3\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\), and the invariant mass of the track pair fell within the interval 790-990\(\mathrm{\,Me\kern-1.0ptV}\), under the assumption that they were left by \(K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}\) hadrons. In Figure 1, the signal has been fitted to a Breit-Wigner function convoluted with a Gaussian and the background has been fitted to a second degree polynomial function.

To find the \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) candidates, the tracks from each combination of \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(K^{0*}\to K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}\) candidates were fitted to a common point. The two muon tracks were constrained to the PDG \(J/\psi\) mass. These quadruplets of tracks were assumed to be from \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) decays if the transverse momentum of the \(B^{0}_{d}\) candidate was greater than 10\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and the fit resulted in a \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f<6\). In the case of more than one candidate per event, the candidate with the lowest \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f\) was retained.

\(B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\phi\) candidates were sought by fitting the tracks from each combination of \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\) candidates fitted to a common vertex. The two muon tracks were constrained to the PDG \(J/\psi\) mass. These quadruplets of tracks were assumed to be from \(B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\phi\) decays if the transverse momentum of the \(B^{0}_{s}\) candidate was greater than 10\(\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and the fit resulted in a \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f<6\). If there was more than one candidate per event then the candidate with the lowest \(\chi^{2}/n.d.f\) was chosen.

Accepted \(B^{0}_{s}\) and \(B^{0}_{d}\) candidates contain a negligible background from non-resonant \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pairs, 0.1% and 0.2% respectively, and therefore the background from non-resonant \(\mathrm{bb}\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}X\) events are not considered in this analysis.

Events were accepted in a wide invariant mass window of \(\pm 12\cdot\sigma\) around \(B\) hadron mass, where the mass resolution \(\sigma\) was determined from reconstruction of the \(B^{0}_{d}\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\) masses for the two signal channels. The mass resolutions were obtained from fitting a single Gaussian to the Monte Carlo signal. Table 2 shows the number of events that can be expected using the above procedure for an integrated luminosity of 10 \(\mathrm{pb^{-1}}\).

By the time the LHC reaches a luminosity of \(10^{33}\)\(\mathrm{\,cm^{-2}\,\,s^{-1}}\) and the detector is better understood, it will be safe to apply displaced secondary vertex cuts, which will remove most of the backgrounds.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c}  & Selected candidates \\  & expected with 10 \(\mathrm{pb^{-1}}\) \\ \hline \hline Signal \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) & 1024 \\ \(pp\to J/\psi X\) background & 1419 \\ \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi X\) background & 3970 \\ \hline Signal \(B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\phi\) & 76 \\ \(pp\to J/\psi X\) background & 2449 \\ \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi X\) background & 1660 \\ \hline All events satifying \(B^{0}_{d}\) or \(B^{0}_{s}\) selections & 10323 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Signal and background statistics of \(B^{0}_{s}\) and \(B^{0}_{d}\) candidates expected with 10 \(\mathrm{pb^{-1}}\).

In the studies of exclusive channels of \(B\) decays, vertex displacement selections are replaced by cuts on the \(B\) hadron decay time. This method avoids any bias on the proper decay time measurements. Table 3 shows the reconstruction efficiences with and without decay time cuts. In particular, by requiring that the proper decay time of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidate is greater than 0.5 ps, additional rejection by a factor of 260 for the \(pp\to J/\psi X\) can be achieved while losing 25% of the signal.

## 4 Simultaneous fit of mass and lifetime of \(B_{d}^{0}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\) with early data

We now turn to methods for extracting physically interesting parameters from the decays of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\) mesons. The first measurements with early data will comprise the mean lifetimes and masses of these mesons.

We perform a simultaneous maximum likelihood fit for each \(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\) mass and proper decay time distributions. The likelihood function \(L\) is defined by:

\[L=\prod_{i=1}^{N}\left[\frac{n_{sig}}{N}\times p_{sig}(t_{i},m_{i})+\frac{n_{ bck1}}{N}\times p_{bkg1}(t_{i},m_{i})+\frac{N-n_{sig}-n_{bck1}}{N}\times p_{ bkg2}(t_{i},m_{i})\right] \tag{1}\]

where the index \(i\) runs over the events, \(N=n_{sig}+n_{bck1}+n_{bck2}\) is the total number of reconstructed events in the fit and \(n_{sig}\), \(n_{bck1}\) and \(n_{bck2}\) are the numbers of signal and background events. The terms \(p_{sig}\), \(p_{bkg1}\) and \(p_{bkg2}\) are products of two probability density functions that model the mass \(m\) and proper decay time \(t\) of the signal and the prompt and non-prompt backgrounds respectively (see Section 2). The number of expected events for the prompt background is \(n_{bck1}\) and the corresponding probability density function in formula 1 is \(p_{bkg1}\). The probability density function for the non-prompt background is \(p_{bkg2}\).

For the signal, the mass distribution is modeled by a Gaussian distribution, whose mean value is the \(B\) hadron mass m(\(B\)) and its width \(\sigma_{m}\) is given by the detector mass resolution. Both m(\(B\)) and \(\sigma_{m}\) are determined from the fit. The reconstructed proper decay time distribution for the signal is parameterised by the function:

\[p_{sig}(t_{i})=\frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}\mathrm{e}^{-\Gamma t}\rho(t-t_{i})\, \mathrm{d}t}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\int_{0}^{\infty}\mathrm{e}^{- \Gamma t}\rho(t-t^{\prime})\,\mathrm{d}t\right)\,\mathrm{d}t^{\prime}} \tag{2}\]

where the decay time resolution function \(\rho(t-t_{i})\) was approximated by a Gaussian of width \(\sigma\) which is a free parameter of the fit.

For the background, the mass distribution of the prompt component is assumed to follow a flat distribution as observed in simulated data (see Figure 2). The non-prompt component is modeled with a second order polynomial function where the coefficient of the linear (quadratic) terms, denoted as \(c_{1}\) (\(c_{2}\)) in Table 4, are determined from the fit.

The decay time distribution of the prompt background component is parametrised by a Gaussian of width \(\sigma\). The non-prompt component was modeled by the sum of two exponential functions, convoluted with the decay time resolution function \(\rho\). The two exponential functions are denoted as \(\Gamma_{1}\) and \(\Gamma_{2}\), the constant coefficient between them is \(b_{1}\).

\[p_{bck2}(t_{i})=\frac{\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\Gamma_{1}\mathrm{e}^{-\Gamma_{1} t}+\mathrm{b}_{1}\times\Gamma_{2}\mathrm{e}^{-\Gamma_{2}t}\right)\rho(t-t_{i}) \,\mathrm{d}t}{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left(\int_{0}^{\infty}\left(\Gamma_{1} \mathrm{e}^{-\Gamma_{1}t}+\mathrm{b}_{1}\times\Gamma_{2}\mathrm{e}^{-\Gamma_{ 2}t}\right)\rho(t-t^{\prime})\,\mathrm{d}t\right)\mathrm{d}t^{\prime}} \tag{3}\]

### \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) decay

The likelihood function, \(-2lnL\) is minimised to extract the \(B_{d}^{0}\) lifetime \(\tau=1/\Gamma\) and mass m(\(B\)) from the reconstructed events containing a \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) candidates and backgrounds. This fit corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 10 pb\({}^{-1}\). The distributions of the reconstructed masses and lifetimes are shown in Figure 2. Table 4 summarises the results of the likelihood fit. The values obtained from the fit agree with the input values used in the simulation (given in the first column) within the statistical errors of the fit. The average lifetime of the \(B_{d}^{0}\) can be measured with an uncertainty of 10% for 10 \(pb^{-1}\).

### \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) decay

The \(B_{s}^{0}\)\(\overline{B_{s}^{0}}\) system exhibits two mass eigenstates with two lifetimes; the lifetime difference \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}/\Gamma_{s}\) is expected to be \(\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})\). However, with early data (a few hundred pb\({}^{-1}\)), the statistics are insufficient to determine both lifetimes. For the initial period of LHC running, it is assumed that \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}=0\). The method for the \(B_{s}^{0}\) fit is the same as for the \(B_{d}^{0}\) case, the main difference being the smaller fraction of signal events, as shown in the mass and lifetime distributions for the reconstructed events after cuts selecting the \(B_{s}^{0}\) signal (Figure 3).

Statistics of reconstructed events corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 150 pb\({}^{-1}\) enables measurements to be made with relative precisions on the \(B_{s}^{0}\) lifetime of 10% (Table 5). In the fit the background events are weighted by factor of 15, since Monte Carlo statistics were limited to the equivalent of 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) for the current study.

## 5 The performance of the jet charge tagger with early data

Most studies of CP-violation and mixing require the identification of the flavour of the neutral \(B\) mesons; this is known as _flavour tagging_. Understanding the potential for flavour tagging methods will be one of the important goals with early data. In studies of CP-violation and mixing of neutral \(B\) mesons, one must know the flavour of a \(B\) meson both at the time of production (\(t=0\)) and at the time of decay.

In a small number of cases, the flavour at production can be inferred from the charge of the highest \(p_{T}\) lepton unassociated with the signal decay, with the assumption that this tagging lepton originates

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}  & Input & Fit result with statistical error \\ \hline \(\Gamma_{s},\ \mathrm{ps}^{-1}\) & 0.683 & 0.743 \(\pm\) 0.051 \\ \(\mathrm{m}(B),\ \mathrm{GeV}\) & 5.343 & 5.359 \(\pm\) 0.006 \\ \hline \(\sigma\), ps & & 0.152 \(\pm\) 0.001 \\ \(\sigma_{m}\), GeV & & 0.061 \(\pm\) 0.006 \\ \hline \(n_{sig}/N\) & 0.018 & 0.031 \(\pm\) 0.005 \\ \(n_{bck1}/N\) & 0.397 & 0.379 \(\pm\) 0.006 \\ \hline \(b_{1}\) & & 0.023 \(\pm\) 0.01 \\ \(\Gamma_{1},ps^{-1}\) & & 1.35 \(\pm\) 0.02 \\ \(\Gamma_{2},ps^{-1}\) & & 0.44 \(\pm\) 0.08 \\ \(c_{1}\) & & -1.44 \(\pm\) 0.07 \\ \(c_{2}\) & & 2.14 \(\pm\) 0.49 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

from a semi-leptonic decay of the other \(B\) hadron in the event. For the majority of the events, one must use the jet charge tagging method. According to fragmentation models, the particles are ordered in the momentum component parralle to the original quark direction, while charge conservation also imposes charge ordering [7]. These two facts may be used to form a jet charge, which is related to the \(b\)-quark charge at production. The jet used in this method consists of all tracks that are unassociated with the signal decay with \(p_{T}>500\) MeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\), inside a cone of opening angle \(\Delta R\) around the \(B\) meson in the laboratory frame. The opening angle of the jet cone, \(\Delta R\), is defined:

\[\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\varphi^{2}} \tag{4}\]

where \(\Delta\eta\) and \(\Delta\varphi\) are the differences in pseudorapidity and azimuthal angle between the cone wall and the \(B\) meson. The jet charge, \(Q_{\rm jet}\), tends to be positive for \(\bar{b}\)-jets and negative for \(b\)-jets, thus allowing the \(B^{0}\) meson flavour at production to be inferred. The jet charge is defined as:

\[Q_{\rm jet}=\frac{\sum_{i}q_{i}p_{i}^{\kappa}}{\sum_{i}|p_{i}|^{\kappa}} \tag{5}\]

where the \(q_{i}\) is the charge of the \(i^{th}\) track in the jet and \(p_{i}\) is a measure of the tracks momentum that can be, for example, the transverse momentum of the track or a projection of the track's momentum along the axis of the \(B\) meson's direction. These are referred to as the \(p_{T}\) method and the \(p_{L}\) method respectively. The parameter \(\kappa\) controls the relative contribution of the hard and soft tracks in the jet charge. One possible improvement in the algorithm is to remove ambiguous cases such as events with \(Q_{\rm jet}\) close to zero; the smallest allowed value of \(|Q_{jet}|\) is called the "exclusion cut". The opening angle of the jet cone, the exclusion cut and \(\kappa\) are free parameters and must be tuned to get the best performance from the tagger.

Figure 3: Plots to show the distributions of the reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) mass and decay time expected with 150 pb\({}^{-1}\). Background distributions constructed from simulated events corresponding to 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) were scaled by a factor of 15.

### Quantifying the performance of a flavour tagger

The effectiveness of the discrimination between \(B^{0}\) and \(\overline{B^{0}}\) mesons at production time is characterized by two quantities: its _efficiency_, \(\epsilon_{\rm tag}\), and the _dilution_, \(D_{\rm tag}\). The efficiency is the fraction of \(B\) mesons that were tagged either correctly or incorrectly and is described by:

\[\epsilon_{\rm tag}=\frac{N_{r}+N_{w}}{N_{t}} \tag{6}\]

where \(N_{r}\) and \(N_{w}\) are the numbers of correctly and incorrectly tagged \(B\) mesons respectively, and \(N_{t}\) is the total number of reconstructed \(B\) mesons. The _dilution_, also known as the _purity_, is given by:

\[D_{\rm tag}=\frac{N_{r}-N_{w}}{N_{r}+N_{w}}=1-2w_{\rm tag} \tag{7}\]

where \(w_{\rm tag}\) is the wrong tag fraction:

\[w_{\rm tag}=\frac{N_{w}}{N_{r}+N_{w}} \tag{8}\]

In a typical CP violation study, where the aim is to identify a difference in some property between a particle and its anti-particle, the relationship between the true asymmetry of this property, \(A_{true}\), and the asymmetry as measured in the data, \(A_{meas}\), will be

\[A_{true}=\frac{1}{D_{\rm tag}}A_{meas} \tag{9}\]

which is derived in, for instance, [8]. For the small asymmetries expected in the \(B\) decays, the statistical uncertainty on \(A_{true}\) is, to a good approximation:

\[\sigma_{A}\approx\frac{1}{\sqrt{\epsilon_{\rm tag}D_{\rm tag}^{2}N_{t}}} \tag{10}\]

The tag algorithm effectiveness is indicated by the _quality factor_ or _tagging power_, \(Q_{\rm tag}\):

\[Q_{\rm tag}=\epsilon_{\rm tag}D_{\rm tag}^{2} \tag{11}\]

The quality factor is used as a measure of success when optimising the flavour tagger.

### Understanding the jet charge tagger using \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) decays

During the early data taking phase, there will be too few \(B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\phi\) decays reconstructed to allow a detailed comparison between the jet charge distribution obtained from the data and that predicted by the Monte Carlo. However, there will be a sufficient number of the analogous \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) decays to allow such a comparison to be made. Additionally, the final state of the \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\), with a subsequent decay of \(K^{0*}\) to charged mesons, allows the initial flavour to be determined in a statistical way, and therefore the decay mode is considered as self-calibrating. The jet charge tagger thus produced will be important for the CP violation studies with \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K_{S}\), and the study of \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) will allow us to gain confidence in the tagging performance for \(B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\phi\).

For this study, the signal decays were reconstructed as described in the Section 3 for both \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\phi\) decays. A reconstructed sample of 15000 decays was used for each channel, corresponding to 150 pb\({}^{-1}\)for \(B^{0}_{d}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) and 1.5 fb\({}^{-1}\)for \(B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\phi\); this defines our working point for the two channels in this study. The quality factor was then maximised by systematically varying the jet charge tagger input parameters \(\Delta R\), \(\kappa\) and exclusion cut. It was found that optimal results for both\(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\) mesons were obtained using the projection of the track momentum in the direction of the \(B\) meson (the \(p_{L}\) method) as the measure of momentum in Equation 5. The other optimal parameters are shown in Table 6. Using these optimised parameters, the jet charge distribution for both \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) are shown in Figure 4.

One might expect that the different flavour content in the formation of the \(B\) mesons will result in a different jet charge behavior for \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\). This is indeed what is observed, both in the optimisation of these jet charges and their distributions. However, one should also note that both the shapes and the optimised parameters, except the exclusion cut, are similar.

The numbers in Table 7 characterise the expected performance of the jet charge tagger. With an integrated luminosty of \(150\;\;\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\), it will be possible to calibrate the jet charge tagger for the \(B_{d}^{0}\), from the data, with an efficiency of \(87.0\pm 0.3\%\) and a wrong tag fraction of \(38.0\pm 0.4\%\). Calibrating with real data for the \(B_{s}^{0}\) is more challenging as there is no readily available and clean self-tagging mode. In this case, the Monte Carlo dependent calibration will be used, but the agreement of the Monte Carlo with real data will be tested indirectly though the \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) channel.

## 6 Summary and conclusion

With the early data, the decays \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) can be used to measure \(B\) hadron masses and lifetimes with sufficient precision to permit sensitive tests of the detector performance. In particular, the \(B_{d}^{0}\) lifetime can be determined with a relative statistical error of \(10\%\), with an integrated luminosity of \(10\;\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\), and the same precision will be achieved for the \(B_{s}^{0}\) lifetime with \(150\;\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). The proposed method

of a simultaneous fit of background and signal events allows a sensitive determination of the masses and decay times of \(B\) mesons. With early data, the optimal overall precision will be obtained with no cuts on the secondary vertex displacement. This is appropriate for the early data when the performance of the detector and reconstruction algorithms may not be well understood. This strategy is consistent with that of the early \(B\)-physics triggers, where no displacement cuts on the \(J/\psi\) will be applied at the trigger level.

In the early data taking phase, the self-tagging decay \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) will be used to calibrate the jet charge tag for jets containing a \(B_{d}^{0}\). This will be of use for physics studies involving \(B_{d}^{0}\) decays, but also this good understanding for the tagging performance for \(B_{d}^{0}\to J/\psi K^{0*}\) will allow the fragmentation modelling for \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) decays to be improved.
