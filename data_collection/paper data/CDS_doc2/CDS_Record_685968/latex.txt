## 1 Introduction

The operation of detectors at the LHC is most challenging in terms of radiation damage. Detectors for tracking applications inside the inner cavity of an electromagnetic calorimeter and close to the interaction point will receive charged particle doses in the range of \(\sim\)10 Mrad and fast neutron fluences \(\sim\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) during the lifetime of an experiment[1]. The basic damage mechanisms in semiconductors are conveniently separated into two categories[23]: a) Bulk effects, which are manifestations of the displacement of atoms from their normal sites in the crystal lattice. b) Surface effects, which are long-term ionisation effects in the insulators that adjoin the active semiconductor region. In this paper we discuss the effects of bulk damage due to neutron irradiation on the properties of GaAs detectors.

Gallium Arsenide detectors have been shown[4] to be radiation resistant to neutron irradiation for fluences up to 10\({}^{15}\)n/cm\({}^{2}\) and consequently the use of GaAs detectors as a part of the inner tracker has been proposed by the ATLAS collaboration[1].For this work pad detectors were irradiated in the ISIS spallation neutron source at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory[5]. The energy spectrum of the ISIS neutrons is similar to that produced in a hadron collider[6]. The absolute neutron fluence is estimated to be known with an error of 20% and the relative calibration between \(\tilde{}\) fluences does not exceed 2%.[1]

## 2 Detectors

The detectors were diffused p\({}^{+}\)-i-n\({}^{+}\) structures fabricated on LEC grown semi-insulating Gallium Arsenide. The n\({}^{+}\) ohmic contact covered the whole backside of the detector whereas the front side was patterned with four circular pads of 3mm in diameter, the p\({}^{+}\) blocking contacts. The thickness of the substrate was 450\(\upmu\)m. More detailed description of the contacts can be found elsewhere[7]. Forty eight diodes have been irradiated, eight at each fluence. All the diodes were fabricated on the same wafer. Four diodes were kept as a control\({}^{\prime}\) sample.

## 3 Radiation Damage

### 3.1 Leakage Currents

Measurements of leakage currents have been made as a function of reverse bias voltage for the various neutron fluences that have been achieved. The measurements have been taken up to 500V using a Keithley 487 picoammeter/voltage source. Typical leakage currents before irradiation were around 10nA/mm\({}^{2}\) at 20\({}^{0}\) C.

It has been shown[8], that the temperature dependence of the reverse current in SI GaAs is given by:

\[I\propto e^{E/KT} \tag{1}\]

where E is the donors' (EL2) activation energy (0.75\(\pm\)0.02 eV). Since the leakage currents has not been measured at the same temparature (the temperature varied over a range of 18\({}^{\circ}\)C to 21\({}^{\circ}\)C) we can use the above relation to normalise all the I-V curves to the same temperature, e.g. at 20\({}^{\circ}\)C. In fig.1 the I-V characteristics at various neutron fluences are presented normalised to 20\({}^{\circ}\)C. After irradiation the I-V curves show two distinct regions: a) a region in which the current increases slowly with reverse bias and scales with neutron fluence, and b) a region where the current increases faster with further applied voltage (soft breakdown region). This behaviour of the I-V characteristics has also been observed for silicon irradiated diodes[9]. Since the detectors are activated after the irradiation, and because of safety measurements the I-V measurements shown have been taken one month after the end of the irradiation and consequently have not been corrected for annealing.

The IV curves show an increase of the plateau leakage current with fluence, which is attributed to an increase of the damage in the bulk. This can be seen in fig.2, where the difference between the maximum (before the soft breakdown region of the I-V) leakage current after irradiation and of the plateau leakage current value before irradiation, is plotted as a function of\({}^{\prime}\) fluence.

In this figure can be seen a saturation in the increase of the leakage current with fluence, which gives rise to two distinct linear parts in the curve around \(10^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\). The increase of the leakage current with fluence is given by the" expression:

Figure 1: I-V curves before and after irradiation normalised to T=20\({}^{0}\)C. No annealing corrections have been made.

Figure 2: Leakage current density vs n-fluence at T=20\({}^{0}\)C. No annealing corrections have been made.

\[\Delta I/V=\alpha_{n}\Phi_{n} \tag{2}\]

where \(\alpha_{n}\) is the damage constant and V is the active volume of the device. Linear regression fits were performed on the two linear regions, and the value from the best fits for the corresponding damage constants, \(\alpha_{n}\), were taken:

\[\alpha_{n}=(3.42\pm\ 0.19)\ 10^{-19}\ \mathrm{A/cm}\], at \[\Phi_{n}\leq 10^{14}\ \mathrm{n/cm}^{2}\] \[\alpha_{n}=(1.36\pm 0.13)\ 10^{-20}\ \mathrm{A/cm}\], at \[\Phi_{n}>10^{14}\ \mathrm{n/cm}^{2}\]

### Charge Collection Efficiencies(CCE).

The degradation of the CCE, for front and back contact irradiation with alpha particles and for mips, with increasing neutron fluence has been studied. The charge collection efficiency is defined as Q\({}_{\mathrm{measured}}\) / Q\({}_{\mathrm{calculated}}\) where Q\({}_{\mathrm{measured}}\) is the number of charge carriers collected and Q\({}_{\mathrm{calculated}}\) is the expected number. The latter is given by, Q\({}_{\mathrm{calculated}}\) = E/e, where E is the energy deposited in the detector and \(\epsilon\) is the average energy required to create an electron-hole pair (4.27 eV)[10]. The Q\({}_{\mathrm{measured}}\) has been measured by using standard spectroscopy electronics, which includes a Tennelec TC170 charge sensitive preamplifier, a Tennelec TC243 pulse shaping amplifier with Gaussian shaping and a shaping time of 0.5 \(\upmu\)s.

The range of 5.48 MeV alpha particles (from an \({}^{241}\)Am source) in GaAs is approximately 20\(\upmu\)m. So by irradiating the detector from the front-p\({}^{+}\) (back-n\({}^{+}\)) contact, the signal is due to the collection of electrons (holes)[11], and therefore their charge collection efficiency can be studied separately.The results for the CCE of alpha particles (in vacuo) for front and back contact irradiation are shown in\({}^{\ast}\) fig.3 and fig.4 respectively.

Figure 3: Charge collection efficiency for front contact\({}^{\ast}\) irradiation with alpha particles.

As it can be seen in both figures the charge collected in the electrodes is decreasing with increasing fluence. However the decrease of the hole signal is more dramatic than the decrease of the electrons and above 6.2\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) no alpha peak has been observed for back contact irradiation. Another interesting point in fig.4 is the observation of the alphas from the back at much lower voltages after irradiation.

Figure 4: Charge collection efficiency for back contact irradiation with alpha particles.

Figure 5: Spectrum of minimum ionising electrons for an* irradiated detector.

The mips spectra have been taken using a \({}^{90}\)Sr \(\beta\) source (endpoint energy 2.27MeV) and a Si surface barrier detector as a trigger behind the GaAs detector. Between the two detectors an aluminium absorber of thickness 1.2mm has been placed to ensure the triggering by minimum ionising electrons only, from the continuous spectrum of the beta-emitter source. In fig.5 a typical mips spectrum can be seen, which exhibits the characteristic Landau shape. The CCE as a function of bias voltage at various fluences can be seen in fig.6. It is again apparent a constant decrease of the CCE with increasing neutron fluence. The post irradiation curves have all been stopped arbitrarily and not because of breakdown.

## 4 Discussion

From the back contact irradiation with alpha particles it is evident that the E-field penetration with bias has changed. This is shown more clearly in fig.7. As it can be seen in the figure the alphas from the back are starting to be observed at approximately the same voltage as the start of the soft breakdown region of the I-V and the plateau of the mips CCE. All these suggest that the E-field reaches the back contact at approximately 300V, which is much lower than 600V that was measured for the non irradiated detectors[7], indicating that the E-field penetration is two times larger. Fig. 8 shows that the start of the soft breakdown region in the I-V curves, which corresponds to punch through of the E-field to the rear contact of the detector, scales with fluence. Therefore it appears that the voltage at which both the alphas from the back turn on and the mip CCE

Figure 6: Charge collection efficiency for mips.

reaches a plateau will scale with fluence as well, but further data is required to confirm this.

The CCE has been found to decrease with increasing n-fluence. This is evident in fig.9 where the maximum CCE has been plotted as a function of fluence. However, in the same figure is evident a saturation of the CCE decrease for fluences above \(10^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\), which coincides with the saturation observed above in the leakage current (fig.2) and

Figure 8: Punchthrough voltage vs fluence.

Figure 7: Performance of a GaAs detector irradiated at 3.34 \(10^{13}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\).

with the voltage at which the soft breakdown part of the I-V curves starts (fig.8). The cause of this saturation is not clear.

A last point which is evident in fig.9 is that electrons are affected less by neutron irradiation relative to holes. This leads to the mips signal for irradiated detectors being electron dominated for fluences above 10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\). However it is not clear if this can be attributed to a decrease in the hole lifetimes or to a decrease in the strength of the E-field. A direct probe of the E-field as in reference 7 is needed\({}^{\ast}\) to clarify this point.

## 5 Conclusion

The radiation hardness of GaAs detectors against neutron damage has been systematically tested. There is an increase of the reverse leakage current and a decrease of the CCE with increasing neutron fluence, for example the mips\({}^{\ast}\)CCE at 2.5\(\times\)10\({}^{14}\) n/cm\({}^{2}\) is one fifth of the corresponding CCE before irradiation. However, the maximum plateau leakage current at the highest fluence did not exceed the value of 30 nA/mm\({}^{2}\), a maximum increase of \(\times\)3 relative to the unirradiated devices, and there is evidence for saturation of the degradation of the detector performance with increasing n-fluence. The electric field is affected as well as the collection of electrons and holes, with the holes more severely. Finally, even at the highest fluence achieved the devices were still operational as radiation detectors and the mips signal was well\({}^{\ast}\) resolved from the noise.
