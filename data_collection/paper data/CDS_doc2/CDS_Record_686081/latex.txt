**SENSITIVITY OF THE SIGNAL TO THE GAP**

Mechanical tolerances will cause the gap width in a noble liquid sampling calorimeter to vary about its nominal value. We calculate how the signal varies due to this gap width variation. For gaps larger than nominal the signal increases for long shaping times but decreases for short shaping times. In the forward calorimeter the shaping time is intermediate between these two extremes and the signal is relatively insensitive to gap width variations. The signal is more sensitive to the sampling frequency than to the sampling fraction.

Consider first a single gap in a noble liquid ionization sampling calorimeter. Let the gap width be \(a\). Suppose that \(n\) minimum ionizing particles (MIPs) cross the gap (in the normal direction) in an event. If \(W\) is the energy loss necessary to create one ion pair in the noble liquid, \(dE_{S}/dx\) is the energy loss per g/cm\({}^{2}\) in the noble liquid, and \(\rho_{S}\) is the density of the noble liquid, then the number of free electrons produced in the gap is

\[N_{e}={n\over W}\,a\rho_{S}{dE_{S}\over dx}.\]

For a constant electron drift velocity of \(v_{0}\), the current in the gap is

\[i(t)={e\,N_{e}\over t_{dr}}(1-{t\over t_{dr}})\quad;\quad 0<t<t_{dr}\]

where \(t_{dr}=a/v_{0}\). Note that the initial current \(i(0)\) is independent of the gap width \(a\). It depends only on the ionization density (\(N_{e}/a\)) and electron drift velocity \(v_{0}\). On the other hand the total charge \(Q\) read out of the gap

\[Q=\int_{0}^{t_{dr}}i(t)dt=eN_{e}/2\]

depends linearly on \(a\).

Now consider a gap whose width is larger than the nominal value \(a\) by an amount \(\Delta a\). For a fixed electric field across the gap the current from the gap will be

\[i^{\prime}(t)={eN_{e}^{\prime}\over t_{dr}^{\prime}}(1-{t\over t_{dr}^{\prime }})\quad;\quad 0<t<t_{dr}^{\prime}\]where \(t^{\prime}_{dr}=(\,a+\Delta a\,)/v_{0}=t_{dr}(1+\Delta a/a)\) and \(N^{\prime}_{e}=\frac{n}{W}(\,a+\Delta a\,)\rho_{S}\frac{dE_{s}}{dx}=N_{e}(1+ \Delta a/a)\). The nominal current \(i(t)\) and the current for the exceptional gap \(i^{\prime}(t)\) are plotted in Fig. 1. Note that \(i^{\prime}(0)=i(0)\) and \(Q^{\prime}=Q(1+\Delta a/a)\).

When the gap width varies due to mechanical tolerances however the potential across the gap is fixed rather than the electric field. Because the electron drift velocity depends (weakly) on electric field, the initial current will also depend on gap width. We will parameterize the electron drift velocity as

\[v=v_{0}(1+c\Delta\mathcal{E}/\mathcal{E})=v_{0}(1-c\Delta a/a)\quad\text{for} \quad\Delta a\ll a\]

where \(\mathcal{E}\) is the electric field, \(c\) is a number less than unity (\(c\sim 1/3\) at \(\mathcal{E}=10\) kV/cm) and \(v_{0}\) is the electron drift velocity for the nominal gap. In this case

\[i^{\prime}(t)=\frac{eN^{\prime}_{e}}{t^{\prime}_{dr}}(1-\frac{t}{t^{\prime}_ {dr}})\]

where \(t^{\prime}_{dr}=(\,a+\Delta a\,)/v\approx t_{dr}[(1+(1+c)\Delta a/a]\), \(t_{dr}=a/v_{0}\), and \(N^{\prime}_{e}\) is as before. Thus the initial current is

\[i^{\prime}(0)=i(0)[1-c\Delta a/a]\]

while the collected charge is as before, i.e. \(Q^{\prime}=Q(1+\Delta a/a)\). The nominal current \(i(t)\) and the current for this exceptional gap but with nominal potential \(i^{\prime}(t)\) are plotted in Fig. 2.

Note that the two currents are equal at a time \(t_{c}\,(t_{c}=t_{dr}\frac{c}{1+2c})\) which is independent of \(\Delta a\). If one could measure the current at this time then one would have a measurement which is completely insensitive to gap width variations. But we are unable to measure the current in the gap. Rather we measure the voltage out of a preamp and shaper circuit. We will show that under realistic circumstances the measured signal out of the electronics chain is not very sensitive to gap width variations.

Figure 3 contains a very schematic readout electronics front end. The current waveforms of figure 2 are represented by the current generator at the left in the figure. The capacitor \(C_{D}\) acts as the capacitance of the detector electrode. In the case of interest to us the electronics is located remotely so a coax cable carries the signal from the electrode to the preamp. The characteristic impedance of the cable is \(R_{0}\). If the current generator provided a current impulse (a delta function) then the current waveform at the input to the preamp would be a decaying exponential of time constant \(\tau=R_{0}C_{D}\). The preamp depicted here is a '0T' style preamp, a current amplifier. We assume it reproduces the signal faithfully, i.e. it has infinite frequency response. The feedback loop is used to adjust the preamp input impedance to match the cable impedance. The non-inverting buffer is

usually a White follower. The shaper is very conventional but has one less integration stage than normal. Each stage (one differentiation and one integration) has the same time constant. The output voltage v (see Figure 4) is fed to a Track & Hold circuit (not shown) which is triggered on the peak of the first lobe of the shaped bipolar pulse. The Track & Hold output is then fed to an ADC. It is the voltage signal v at this peak which we consider to be the measured quantity.

When \(R_{0}C_{D}=RC\equiv\tau\) the impulse response of the circuit is

\[\mbox{v}_{\delta}(t)=\frac{Q\,R_{c}}{\tau}\,\mathbf{x}(1-\frac{\mbox {\boldmath$x$}}{2})e^{-\mathbf{x}}\]

where \(\mathbf{x}=t/\tau\) and \(Q\) is the area of the current impulse. The value of \(x\) at which the impulse response reaches its first maximum is \(\mathbf{x}_{\delta}^{\rm max}=2-\sqrt{2}\). The response to the triangle input current waveform of equation 1 is

\[\mbox{v}_{\Delta}(t)=\frac{i(0)R_{c}}{\mathbf{x}_{dr}}[(\frac{1}{2} \mathbf{x}_{dr}\mathbf{x}^{2}+\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{x$ }^{2}+\mbox{\boldmath$x}+1)e^{-\mathbf{x}}-1]\quad;\quad 0<\mathbf{x}<\mathbf{x}_{dr}\]

where \(\mathbf{x}_{dr}=t_{dr}/\tau\). The value of \(x\) at which the triangle response reaches its first maximum is

\[\mathbf{x}_{\Delta}^{\rm max}=\frac{2\mathbf{x}_{dr}}{ \mathbf{x}_{dr}+1}\quad\mbox{when}\quad\mathbf{x}_{\Delta}^ {\rm max}<\mathbf{x}_{dr}.\]

Note that \(\mathbf{x}_{\Delta}^{\rm max}=\mathbf{x}_{dr}\) when \(\mathbf{x}_{dr}=1\) so requiring \(\mathbf{x}_{\Delta}^{\rm max}<\mathbf{x}_{dr}\) is equivalent to requiring that \(\mathbf{x}_{dr}>1\). Also note that \(\mathbf{x}_{\Delta}^{\rm max}\to 2\) when \(\mathbf{x}_{dr}\gg 1\). Solving the transcendental equation

\[e^{\mathbf{x}_{c}}=1+\mathbf{x}_{c}+\frac{1}{2}(1+\frac{c}{1 +2c}\mathbf{x}_{dr})\mathbf{x}_{c}^{2}\]

for \(\mathbf{x}_{c}\)\((=t_{c}/\tau)\) gives the value of \(x\) where \(\mbox{v}_{\Delta}(t_{c})\) for the nominal gap and for the larger gap are equal, i.e. independent of \(\Delta a\). Figure 4 shows the output voltage signal v of the shaper for the nominal gap (input current waveform \(i(t)\) of Figure 2) and for the exceptional gap (input current waveform \(i^{\prime}(t)\) of Figure 2). At the time of the peak of this signal, i.e. at \(t=\mathbf{x}_{\Delta}^{\rm max}\tau\), the signal amplitude varies due to gap width variations by an amount

\[\frac{\Delta\mbox{v}_{\Delta}}{\mbox{v}_{\Delta}}\bigg{|}_{\mathbf{x} =\mathbf{x}_{\Delta}^{\rm max}}=\left[\frac{2\mathbf{x}_{dr }^{3}(1+c)}{(\mathbf{x}_{dr}+1)^{2}(2\mathbf{x}_{dr}+1-e^{ \mathbf{x}_{\Delta}^{\rm max}})}-(1+2c)\right]\frac{\Delta\,a}{a}\]

when \(\mathbf{x}_{\Delta}^{\rm max}<\mathbf{x}_{dr}\).

Figure 5 shows the difference between the output voltage signal for the nominal and the exceptional gap. The larger curve corresponds to the two signals in Figure 4. The smaller corresponds to \(\Delta\,a/a=0.04\), a more reasonable value. Note that higher order terms, which we have neglected, are apparent. Table 1 lists values of the relevant parameters for several gaps of practical interest. The first three correspond to the gaps in the three modules of the ATLAS forward calorimeter while the fourth corresponds to the accordion calorimeter. The last two are limiting cases; a step function current applied to the electrodes, i.e. \(t_{dr}\rightarrow\infty\), and \(\tau\rightarrow\infty\). This last case is the one approximating the previous generation of

short shaping times the signal increases by an amount typically less than the amount by which the gap increases. This is what we mean by _relatively insensitive to the gap width_. The next to last column in Table 1 shows that this coefficient is less than unity except in the last example where the whole charge in the gap contributes to the signal.

Now consider a parallel plate sampling calorimeter where \(a\) is the width of each sampling gap, \(b\) is the width of each absorber plate (both in cm), \(dE_{S}/\boldsymbol{dx}\) (\(dE_{A}/\boldsymbol{dx}\)) is the energy loss per g/cm\({}^{2}\) for a MIP in the noble liquid (absorber plate), and \(\rho_{S}\) (\(\rho_{A}\)) is the density of the noble liquid (absorber plate) in g/cm\({}^{3}\). Then the \(dE/\boldsymbol{dx}\) weighted sampling fraction is defined as

\[f_{Q}\equiv\frac{\boldsymbol{a}\rho_{S}\frac{dE_{S}}{\boldsymbol{dx}}}{ \boldsymbol{a}\rho_{S}\frac{dE_{S}}{\boldsymbol{dx}}+\boldsymbol{b}\rho_{A} \frac{dE_{A}}{\boldsymbol{dx}}}=\frac{\boldsymbol{a}}{\boldsymbol{a}+ \boldsymbol{b}\boldsymbol{r}}\quad\text{where}\quad r=\frac{\rho_{A}\frac{dE_{ A}}{\boldsymbol{dx}}}{\rho_{S}\frac{dE_{S}}{\boldsymbol{dx}}} \tag{2}\]

a unitless number. The \(dE/\boldsymbol{dx}\) weighted sampling frequency is defined as

\[f_{0}=\frac{1}{\boldsymbol{a}+\boldsymbol{b}\boldsymbol{r}}=\frac{1}{ \boldsymbol{a}}f_{Q}\]

which has units of cm\({}^{-1}\). It's a measure of how often a sample is recorded. Other units for \(f_{0}\) may sometimes be appropriate such as gm\({}^{-1}\)cm\({}^{2}\). These are obtained by multiplying our definition by \((\rho_{S}\frac{dE_{S}}{\boldsymbol{dx}})^{-1}\) which is just a scale change. Note that often \(\boldsymbol{b}\gg\boldsymbol{a}\) so \(f_{0}\) is largely independent of the gap width \(\boldsymbol{a}\). Crudely speaking the sampling frequency is large when many samples are taken per unit depth of calorimeter.

Let us imagine that some region of the calorimeter is made up of gaps all with the nominal width \(\boldsymbol{a}\) and that some separate region of the calorimeter is made of gaps with exceptional width \(\boldsymbol{a}+\Delta\boldsymbol{a}\). Further we assume that the exceptional gaps are larger because the absorber plates are thinner, i.e. of width \(\boldsymbol{b}-\Delta\boldsymbol{a}\). Then the sampling fraction and frequency in the exceptional region are

\[f_{Q}^{\prime}=f_{Q}\Big{[}1+\big{(}1+f_{Q}(r-1)\big{)}\frac{\Delta\boldsymbol{ a}}{\boldsymbol{a}}\Big{]}\quad\text{and}\quad f_{0}^{\prime}=f_{0}\Big{[}1+f_{Q}(r-1) \frac{\Delta\boldsymbol{a}}{\boldsymbol{a}}\Big{]}.\]Often \(r\gg 1\) and \(b\geq a\). Then

\[f_{Q}^{\prime}=f_{Q}\Big{[}1+\big{(}1+\frac{a}{b}\big{)}\frac{\Delta a}{a}\Big{]} \quad\text{and}\quad f_{0}^{\prime}=f_{0}\,\Big{[}1+\frac{a}{b}\frac{\Delta a}{a }\Big{]}.\]

For a shower of a given energy, the signal, summed over all the gaps, is proportional to the sampling frequency \(f_{0}\). That is, the signal will be larger where the sampling frequency is larger simply because more gaps are involved in the sum due to the fact that the shower penetrates more gaps. This factor is on top of the other factors already calculated for a single gap. The last entry in Table 1 includes an estimate of this factor for the three modules of the ATLAS forward calorimeter and for the barrel accordion calorimeter. The table entry is the quantity

\[\frac{\Delta f_{0}/f_{0}}{\Delta a/a}=f_{Q}(r-1)\]

where \(r\) is given in equation 2. So in order to calculate the size of the signal in the region of the calorimeter where the gaps are larger than nominal (due to thinner absorbers) one takes the nominal signal and increases it by the fraction obtained by adding the numbers in the last two columns of Table 1. This is typically a number smaller than unity.

But it is an extreme assumption to suppose that the exceptional gaps are concentrated in a separate region of the calorimeter. The more normal distribution of variations due to mechanical tolerances is more uniform over the calorimeter so that any one shower samples sections where the gaps are both larger than nominal and smaller than nominal. So, to a degree, the variations are averaged over. How these variations might be distributed is a subject beyond the scope of this paper.
