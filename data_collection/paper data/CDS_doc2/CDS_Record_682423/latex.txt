**Summary**

High resolution drift tubes will be used in the ATLAS muon system to reconstruct trajectories in the bend plane. However, owing to the \(\phi\)-dependence of the ATLAS toroidal magnetic field, the momentum reconstruction is dependent on the nonbend coordinate resolution which is determined by the strip size of the nonbend plane detection elements. Given in this note is the effect of the strip size on the transverse momentum resolution.

**(I) \(\Phi\)-Dependence of Sagitta and Point-Line**

The \(\phi\)-dependence of the sagitta, used in the barrel and low \(\eta\) region of the endcaps, and the point-line extrapolation, used in the high \(\eta\) region of the endcaps, is shown in Fig. 1 for several values of \(\eta\), and plotted in Fig. 2 is the derivative. It is this \(\phi\)-dependence which drives the nonbend plane resolution requirements. Note that the barrel and high \(\eta\) region of the endcap are relatively insensitive to the determination of \(\phi\), whereas the region around \(\eta\) = 1.6 \(s_{\rm e}\) is quite sensitive to \(\phi\).

In order to simulate the affect of the \(\phi\)-resolution on the \(P_{\rm t}\) resolution, the error associated with the non-bend coordinate is added in quadrature to the other sources of error in the transverse momentum resolution, as given by

\[\sigma_{\rm T}^{2}=\sigma_{0}^{2}+\left\{s\,{1\,{\rm d}s\over{\rm d}\phi}\, \Delta\phi\right\}^{2}\,, \tag{1}\]

where \(\Delta\phi\) is the \(\phi\)-resolution, \(s\) is the sagitta or point-line variable used to reconstruct the transverse momentum and \(\sigma_{0}\) is the relative transversemomentum resolution from all sources other than the \(\phi\) resolution. In this note the resolution is computed in two ways. In **Method 1**, the derivative in eq. (1) was estimated from a linear approximation of the \(\phi\)-dependence (shown in Fig. 2). By this method the resolution smearing from the \(\phi\)-dependence has been averaged over \(\phi\). In **Method 2** the derivative has been computed from a quadratic fit to the sagitta \(\phi\) dependence. **Method 2** enables both the \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) dependence of the resolution smearing to be estimated.

**(II) \(\Phi\)-Resolution**

The \(\phi\)-resolution was computed by taking the difference of the true value of \(\phi\) of the track in the toroidal system at high momentum, where multiple scattering is small (Pt = 300 GeV/c), and the "measured" value of \(\phi\) resolved by reconstructing the track with finite width strips. Two cases were considered: (1) all 6 chambers participate in the determination of the non-bend track, and (2) only the middle superlayer (2 planes) and first sublayer of the outer superlayer were used.

Fig. 3 shows the resultant \(\phi\)-resolution for these two cases for various strip widths. Note that there is roughly a factor of two scaling between the two cases where for example the resolution for the 6 chamber case for 12 cm strips is roughly equivalent to the 6 cm strips in the 3 chamber case. For ease in computation the \(\phi\)-resolution scaled by the strip size is shown in Fig. 4 for the two cases.

**(II) Pt-Resolution and Conclusions**

**Method 1:**

The resultant sagitta or point-line resolution as computed by **Method 1** is shown in Fig. 5 for both the 3 chamber fit. Fig. 6 is a plot of the corresponding relative resolution degradation as a function of strip width for the 3-chamber fit case. If we allow the resolution to be degraded by no more than 20 % from the finite resolution of the \(\phi\) coordinate we require the strips to be no wider than about 6 cm in the barrel region for the 3 chamber fit. In the endcap region the corresponding strips should be no wider than about 3 cm in the \(\eta\) = 1.6 region for the 6 chamber fit and 1.5 cm for the 3 chamber fit, although wider strips could be tolerated elsewhere. Table 1 summarizes the maximum strip width that can be tolerated without degrading the resolution by more than about 20%.

Although 12 cm strips may be tolerated in terms of the \(\Pt\) resolution when 6-chambers are employed for the nonbend coordinate determination, such strips could be too wide in terms of occupancy, especially in the first superlayer. A more detailed simulation is needed.

### Method 2:

The smearing of the resolution as a function of \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) normalized by the strip width for the 3 and 6 chamber fits in the barrel region is shown in Fig. 7. Note that the demands on the \(\phi\)-resolution increase with increasing \(\eta\) and that the 3 and 6 chamber cases are roughly a factor of two different. Furthermore, the \(\phi\)-resolution does not have to be as good in the \(\phi=0\) region as it must be for \(\phi\geq 0.2\). Fig. 8 shows the corresponding dependencies for the endcap region. A log scale must be used to indicated the extreme sensitivity at \(\eta=1.6\) where the bend power goes nearly to 0 at \(\phi=0.35\).

From Figs. 7 we may determine the degradation of the resolution as a function of strip width. Shown in Fig. 9 is the ratio of the resolution for a given finite strip size to the resolution computed from all terms except the \(\phi\)-resolution for two \(\eta\) regions in the barrel. Note that the requirement of no more than 20% resolution degradation for all \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) would require 3 cm strips for the 3 chamber case in the barrel. Wider strips can be tolerated at \(\eta=0\) but 3 cm strips are needed at \(\eta=1.2\) to meet the 20% criterion for all \(\phi\).

The endcap region is more complicated. The sensitivity to the \(\phi\) resolution can be estimated from Fig. 8. As a rough approximation if we take the resolution to be of order 5 % in that region for sources other than \(\phi\) then the resulting degradation of the resolution as a function of strip width is shown in Fig. 10 for three \(\eta\) regions.

Table 2 is a compilation of the strip sizes determined by Method 2 under the 20% degradation criterion for the 3 chamber fit case.

Note that the analysis provided by Method 2 results in a more stringent requirement on the strip size since our requirement is that the resolution must be degraded by no more than 20% over the entire \(\phi\) range (middle of "large" chamber to the middle of the "small" chamber). It is possible to have different strip widths in the small and large chambers resulting in a more efficient application of the 20% criterion.
