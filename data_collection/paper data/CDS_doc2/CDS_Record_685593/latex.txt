**1. Chamber deformation caused by temperature differences**

The large aluminium chambers will change their dimensions with temperature. The effect of a uniform change of temperature will be absorbed by the projective alignment system; we are only concerned with non-uniform heating because this leads to changes in the internal geometry.

Non-uniform heating can be subdivided into three geometrical categories: (a) between multilayers, (b) along the tubes, and (c) across the tubes, parallel to the layers. There will be no appreciable temperature difference between the layers of a multilayer [1]. In this respect, a multilayer behaves like a sheet of material with zero heat resistance. In the following we discuss the deformations we expect in these categories.

a. Temperature difference \(\Delta t\) between multilayers

A bending in two directions of the entire chamber results. The twoagittae are

\[\begin{array}{l}\mathrm{s_{1}=L_{1}}^{2}\;/\;(8d)\;.\;(\Delta L_{2}/L_{1})\\ \mathrm{s_{2}=L_{2}}^{2}\;/\;(8d)\;.\;(\Delta L_{2}/L_{2})\end{array}\]

where d is the distance between multilayers and L\({}_{1}\) is the tube length and L\({}_{2}\) the length across the tubes, equal to the tube diameter times the number of tubes in a layer. \(\Delta L/L\) is the change in length due to temperature in aluminium, \(24\;\cdot\;10^{-6}\;/0C\;\cdot\;\Delta t\). If the tubes are mounted against the external cross plates with a spring ('double flexo'), \(\mathrm{s_{1}}\) will become smaller by a factor f = 0.1 or 0.05 (under discussion, a perfectly soft double flexo has f = 0).

For example, the large EOL.3 chambers have L\({}_{1}\) = 5.8 m, L\({}_{2}\) = 1.7 m, d = 0.17 m, hence \(\mathrm{s_{1}}\) = f \(\cdot\) 600 \(\mathrm{\mu m/^{0}C}\cdot\Delta t\), \(\mathrm{s_{2}}\) = 50 \(\mathrm{\mu m/^{0}C}\cdot\Delta t\), whereas the BOL chambers have L\({}_{1}\) = 5.0 m, L\({}_{2}\) = 2.16 m, d = 0.32 m, hence \(\mathrm{s_{1}}\) = f \(\cdot\) 240 \(\mathrm{\mu m/^{0}C}\cdot\Delta t\), \(\mathrm{s_{2}}\) = 45 \(\mathrm{\mu m/^{0}C}\cdot\Delta t\).

Up to here we have neglected any heat flow that would equalize the temperatures between multilayers. This is treated in Section 4. But we remark already at this point that the bending of the cross plates described by \(\mathrm{s_{2}}\) is reduced if the cross plates cannot maintain the difference \(\Delta t\) because they conduct the heat better than the multilayer. Introducing a factor g to describe this reduction, we can say g is smaller for thick, heavy cross plates with no double flexo and larger for thin, light cross plates with a very efficient double flexo (hence little heat conductivity). Details must be worked out; with g = 1 one is very much on the safe side, i.e. overestimating the bend of the cross plates.

The physical significance of the bend described by f \(\cdot\) s\({}_{\rm I}\) is a loss of tube-wire concentricity (in the absence of a central wire locator), the one of g \(\cdot\) s\({}_{\rm 2}\) is a deviation of the wire coordinates from the straight line which is the correct location for the wires of one tube layer. b. Temperature difference \(\Delta\)t along the tubes The direct effect is a coordinate scaling that varies over the area of the chamber. It can be shown that after integration over the area the r.m.s. deviation \(\delta\) from the average is

\[\delta={\rm L}_{\rm 2}\cdot(\Delta{\rm L}_{\rm 2}/12{\rm L}_{\rm 2})\]

For example, \(\delta=4\)\(\mu\)m/\({}^{\rm o}\)C \(\cdot\Delta\)t for L\({}_{\rm 2}\) = 2m. This is a relatively small number. In combination with (a), the temperature difference along the tubes results in the bending of the three cross plates being different. c. Temperature difference \(\Delta\)t across the tubes (parallel to the layer) Whereas the direct effect is unimportant, in combination with (a) it results in the tube-wire concentricity being violated differently inside one layer.

There are three papers that specifically deal with heat questions of the MDT chambers. Apart from the TDR [2] we have the Muon Note 107 by L. Baliev, A. Borisov and A. Kojine [3] and the Muon Note 144 by C.H. Daly, G. DeZorzi and P. Oberson [4].

Daly et al. have done heat deflection measurements with the MDT prototype 'Calypso' (L1 = 2.6 m, d = 0.15 m) and measured f \(\cdot\) s\({}_{\rm I}\) = 18 \(\mu\)m/\({}^{\rm o}\)C \(\Delta\)t, thus effectively determining f to be 0.13 for the Calypso design. - Another important observation was the absence of any deformation caused by the heat generated in the electronics and HV cards.

Baliev et al. have shown preliminary measurements of the heating of tubes caused by the power dissipated on the elctronics cards. Their observation at the electronics end of the tubes corresponds to a temperature increase of 0.18 to 0.36 \({}^{\rm o}\)C for the 30 mW of power per channel. They stress their measurement is a 'zero approach to the problem' and hence should be repeated with an advanced prototype chamber. Let us recall that heat flow experiments depend very much on the exact conditions.

## 2 Limiting the influence of the heat environment on the chambers

The temperature differences in the experiment are of the order of a few degrees, but they are difficult to predict [5]. There may or may not be some movement of the air, either by natural convection in the large hall or by ventilation that has to be installed. In the absence of a complete picture of the heat environment we must construct our chambers by staying on the safe side without going to extremely complicated precautions.

In this spirit I try to find the right balance by applying the following principles.

* For coordinate reconstruction we do not wish to depend on models of heat deformation based on temperature data over the chambers, therefore the deformations must remain so small and so simple that the in-plane alignment systems can deal with them.
* Local heating by front end MDT electronics should be avoidable. This seems to be the case [4] and should be tested again with an advanced MDT prototype. It is obviously preferable not to need water cooling.
* Heat from the surrounding air will go into the chambers through the large surfaces. The heat resistance should be increased with a shield; this is especially approriate against moving air. The shield is needed anyway for reasons of mechanical protection. Even if we do not know the characteristics of air movement in the hall we should make the chambers immune against a moderate wind speed that would be associated with any temperature difference between the two sides of a chamber.
* Heat exchange between the two multilayers should be made as large as possible. A passive method working uniformly over the area would be prefereable in comparison to heat pipes.
* The best way to limit the more complicated higher order deformations under (b) and (c) above is to keep the temperature difference small between multilayers.
* It should be our aim to specify a not too small maximal temperature difference that the MDT chambers can tolerate on their two sides.

We have to study the heat transfer between the environment and each multilayer as well as the heat transfer between the multilayers in order to determine the resulting temperature difference between multilayers. Heat conduction, convection and radiation are important. The relevant heat transfer coefficients will be collected in Section 4, and the results are calculated and compared in Section 5.

It will turn out that a good gain can be made by painting the multilayers black on their inside in order to increase the radiative heat exchange between them.

## 3 Heat sources too small to be relevant

In this section we inspect heat sources that exist inside the chambers. It turns out that they produce very little heat in comparison with the quantity of heat that traverses the chamber under an external temperature difference as small as a fraction of a degree.

### Heat carried by fresh gas warmer than the multilayer

The gas volume of a square metre of multilayer is 70 litres, and the heat capacity of argon gas (at 3 bar) is 2.8 Ws / (l \({}^{0}\)C). If the volume is exchanged once per hour, for each degree of temperature difference the multilayer receives heat energy at the rate of

\[\dot{2.8}\cdot 70\ /\ 3600=0.05\ \mathrm{W/(m^{2}\ ^{0}C)}.\]

If the incoming gas is very warm and gives all its heat to the multilayer an influence will be noticable. For example, if it is 5 \({}^{0}\)C warmer, the multilayer receives heat energy at the rate of 0.3 W/m\({}^{2}\).

### Pressure drop across bottle necks in the gas path

Bottle necks exist in the end plugs and, perhaps, in gas jumpers. If a volume V flows across a bottle neck in time t, causing a pressure drop \(\Delta\)p, energy is dissipated at the rate of

\[\mathrm{R}=\Delta\mathrm{p}\ \mathrm{V}\ /\ \mathrm{t}.\]

For reasons of uniformity of gas drift properties we do not allow pressure drops of more than 1 mb between tubes that are part of the same circuit. In the extreme case, assume this pressure drop exists across one pair of end plugs. At a flow of 5 \(l\)/h, and per m of chamber width (100 bottle necks), the energy dissipated is only 15 mW:

\[100\cdot 1\ \mathrm{mb}\cdot 5\ \mathrm{l/h}=100\cdot 100\ \mathrm{N/m^{2} \cdot 5\cdot 10^{-3}\ \mathrm{m^{3}}\ /\ 3600\ \mathrm{s}=15\ \mathrm{mW}}\]

### Heat produced by signals from a 50 Hz/cm\({}^{2}\) photon background (32 keV)

In 1 m\({}^{2}\) of multilayer (100 m wire length) there will be \(50\cdot 3\cdot 10^{4}\) signals, each \(1300\cdot 2\cdot 10^{4}\) electrons over a voltage of 3200 V, therefore producing an energy in each square metre of multilayer, of

\[12.6\cdot 10^{16}\ \mathrm{eV/(m^{2}\ s)\ \ or\ \ 0.02\ \mathrm{W/m^{2}}}.\]which is small. Even if this value would be doubled in order to take into account a practical number of streamers, it would remain small. Also, this heat arises symmetrically in both multilayers of a chamber.

## 4 Applicable heat transfer coefficients

In this section we collect the effects that determine the heat transport across chambers and therefore also the temperature difference between the two multilayers.

### Conduction

If an external shield is mounted separated a distance d = 1.5 cm or 2.5 cm from the multilayer, the gap is too narrow for convection to develop, and heat is transferred by conduction. The coefficients are

h = 1.7 W/(m\({}^{2}\) \({}^{0}\)C) for d = 1.5 cm of air, and

h = 1.0 W/(m\({}^{2}\) \({}^{0}\)C) for d = 2.5 cm of air.

If the gap is filled with some material the values go up. For example, 1.5 cm Styrofoam would yield h = 1.9 W/(m\({}^{2}\) \({}^{0}\)C).

### Natural (free) convection

Vertical and horizontal plates must be treated separately. Natural convection plays a role at the outside boundary of the chamber if there is no additional (imposed) air flow, and also between the multilayers.

Vertical plate in quiet air:

The heat transfer is not simply proportional to the temperature difference \(\Delta\)t between plate and air but varies more strongly. In our range of parameters the heat transfer coefficient can be written approximately as [6[

h = 1.3 (\(\Delta\)t\({}^{0}\)C)\({}^{1/3}\) W/(m\({}^{2}\) \({}^{0}\)C).

It is not easily calculated precisely because construction elements disturb the convective flow of air.

Vertical plates in an enclosed air volume.

For the heat transport between two multilayers with 0.3 m clearance the transfer coefficient may be written [7]

\[\mathrm{h}=\ 0.6\ (\Delta\mathrm{t}^{0}\mathrm{C})^{1/3}\ \ \mathrm{W/(m^{2}\ ^{0}C)}.\]

Values for other situations are contained in the summary table.

### 4.3 Forced convection

This is caused by air that is driven along our chambers by some external mechanism. Even a gentle wind increases the heat transfer appreciably. We consider wind speeds between 1 and 6 m/s, near the boundary between laminar and turbulent flow.

The average heat conveyed to a plate of length L in the laminar range gives rise to a transfer coefficient of [8]

\[\mathrm{h}=3.9\ \mathrm{(u/(m/s))^{1/2}\ (m/L)^{1/2}\ \ \ \ W/(m^{2}\ ^{0}C)}\]

where u is the enforced air speed in m/s and L is given in m.

In turbulent flow, the heat conveyed locally to the same plate can be expressed as [9]

\[\mathrm{h}=4.8\ \mathrm{(u/(m/s))^{4/5}\ (m/L)^{1/5}\ \ \ \ W/(m^{2}\ ^{0}C)}.\]

From these formulas we estimate with L = 2 m:

\[\mathrm{h}=2.8\ \mathrm{W/(m^{2}\ ^{0}C)\ \ for\ u=1\ m/s\ \ (laminar)}\] \[\mathrm{h}=5\ \mathrm{W/(m^{2}\ ^{0}C)\ \ for\ u=3m/s\ \ (laminar)}\] \[\mathrm{h}=18\ \mathrm{W/(m^{2}\ ^{0}C)\ \ for\ u=6\ m/s\ \ (turbulent)}.\]

### 4.4 Radiation between surfaces at different temperatures

This effect is important for the heat exchange between the two multilayers of a chamber and between the chamber and the environment, for example a cold wall of the underground hall or the cryostat of the magnet.

The basic heat radiation from a surface with temperature t, summed over all wavelengths and directions, is

\[R=\sigma\;b\;t^{4},\]

where \(\sigma\) is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and 0 \(<\) b \(<\) 1 is the blackness of the surface, integrated over the wavelengths. Originally b is a function of the wavelength \(\lambda\).

The net heat transfer between two parallel plates at temperatures t and t + \(\Delta\)t and blacknesses b\({}_{1}\) and b\({}_{2}\) is given by [10]

\[\Delta R =\sigma\;[(t+\Delta t)^{4}\;-\;t^{4}]\;/\;(b_{1}\;^{-1}+b_{2}\;^{-1}\; -\;1)\] \[=4\;\sigma\;t^{3}\;/\;(b_{1}\;^{-1}+b_{2}\;^{-1}\;-\;1)\;\cdot\; \Delta t\] \[=\;h_{R}\;\Delta t,\]

calculated to first order in \(\Delta t\)t. According to Planck, for t = 293 K the spectrum of \(\lambda\) has its maximum at \(\lambda_{\rm max}\) = 10 \(\mu\)m, with 90% of the energy falling between 6.5 \(\mu\)m and 27 \(\mu\)m (5% outside each side). For good conductors and wavelengths around \(\lambda\) = 10 \(\mu\)m, b is only a few percent. In aluminium it takes on a value around 10% when averaged over the spectrum. The blackness also depends somewhat on the surface quality. - At t = 293 K, the value of 4 \(\sigma\;t^{3}\) is 5.7 W/(m\({}^{2}\;^{0}\)C). The coefficient h\({}_{R}\) is shown as a function of blackness in Table 1.

Using the proposed paint with b = 0.8 we can reach h\({}_{R}\) = 3.8 W/(m\({}^{2}\;^{0}\)C) whereas the untreated surfaces of the multilayer would only exchange heat at the much lower rate given by h\({}_{R}\) = 0.3 W/(m\({}^{2}\;^{0}\)C). The heat exchanged between the aluminium of a chamber and the wall of the cavern is estimated to be governed by h\({}_{R}\) = 0.55 W/(m\({}^{2}\;^{0}\)C), based on b\({}_{1}\) = 0.1 and b\({}_{2}\) = 0.8.

The coefficients of this section are summarized in Table 2.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|l|} \hline b & 0 & 0.1 & 0.3 & 0.5 & 0.7 & 0.8 & 0.9 & 1 \\ \hline h\({}_{R}\) [W/(m\({}^{2}\;^{0}\)C)] & 0 & 0.3 & 1.0 & 1.9 & 3.1 & 3.8 & 4.7 & 5.7 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 5 Calculation of the temperature difference

between the two multilayers

We use a simple model of heat transport across the large surfaces as characterized in Figs. 1 and 2. There are 6 elements '0' to '5' and 5 heat transfer coefficients between them. Vertical and horizontal chamber orientations should be treated separately, but the results will not be very different as one can see by comparing the relevant rows in Table 2.

\begin{tabular}{|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|p{113.8pt}|} \hline

Table 2: Summary of applicable heat transfer coefficients. The notation (\(\Delta\)t/0C)1/3 stands for a factor equal to the third root of the relevant temperature difference in centigrades.

Figure 1: Model of heat transfer from elements ’5’ to ’0’

Figure 2: Model of calculation of the temperature difference \(t_{3}-t_{2}\) from \(t_{5}-t_{0}\)

The temperature difference \(t_{3}-t_{2}\) between the two multilayers of a chamber is given in proportion to the ratio of the heat resistance \(R_{32}\) to the total heat resistance \(R_{50}\). The resistances add up in series, they are the inverse of the heat transfer coefficients (heat conductances').

In theory these are transcendental equations because some of the \(h_{ik}\) contain third roots of the relevant partial temperature differences. In practice they are almost linear and are solved with one iteration. The results are quoted in Tables 3 A to D for various wind speeds and some radiation on one side. The four tables refer to the cases with and without black paint, with and without the shields. The example of \(t_{5}-t_{0}=5^{0}C\) was chosen because it is not far from a practical admissable value.

The external air speed is given as a parameter, and the effect of a wall with heat absorption is shown.

## 6 Summary

Table 3A shows that temperature differences up to 5 \({}^{\rm o}\)C can be tolerated between the two sides of the chambers with the multilayers being only 0.5 \({}^{\rm o}\)C apart. This number goes up to 0.9 \({}^{\rm o}\)C for a wind speed of 6 m/s. The values for horizontally positioned chambers will be similar. - Without paint the result is a factor 21/2 worse (Table 3 B). Without paint and without shields the result is again worse by another factor 1.5 or 2 (Table 3 D).

Considering that we will hardly have to expect temperature differences much above 5 \({}^{\rm o}\)C, and taken together with the numbers on deformation discussed in Sect. 1, these results show that even the largest chambers will operate with their full precision in the ATLAS environment. Measurements with advanced prototypes on local heating by electronics and on the effect of heat conduction of cross plates should be performed.

\(\Delta\) word of caution. Such heat calculations cannot be very precise, and the environmental conditions will only be known at a time when our chambers are built. It is important to be on the safe side if it can be done with a limited effort. - The arguments collected in this paper show that shielding and painting will presumably solve the problem.
