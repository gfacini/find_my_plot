###### Abstract

We present here results from a series of tests of the supervision system of the PC-based ATLAS Event Filter prototype performed at the _asgard_ Cluster at ETH Zurich. Preliminary conclusions are also drawn on the operation of the name server used in the farm. Further tests will be necessary in order to fully understand effects which have not been seen on smaller configurations.
