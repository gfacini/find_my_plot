We investigate the impact of inner bremsstrahlung on the \(H^{0}\to ZZ^{\star}\to 4l\) channel in ATLAS. Using a dedicated photon radiation package (PHOTOS) interfaced with the PYTHIA generator, we evaluate (at particle level and after full simulation of the detector) the loss of acceptance and the degradation of the Higgs mass resolution due to these QED radiative corrections for \(m_{H}=130\) GeV and \(m_{H}=170\) GeV, both for \(4e\) and \(4\mu\) final states. The overall acceptance drops by 10% whereas the loss in mass resolution is not significant for the electrons channel nor for the muons channel.

Introduction

In the intermediate mass range \(130<m_{H}<180\) GeV, the search for the SM Higgs relies on the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\) channel.

A good leptons momentum measurement is necessary to allow an efficient background rejection, and an accurate mass resolution for the Higgs boson.

The introduction of inner bremsstrahlung, i.e. the emission of photons in the neighbouring of \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) vertex, changes the leptons 4-momentum. This could cause a loss in acceptance and a degradation on mass resolution.

In the following, we study the effects of this inner bremsstrahlung at particle level and after a full simulation of the ATLAS detector.

## 2 Final state Inner bremsstrahlung

For the Technical Proposal, inner bremsstrahlung contribution has not been included in ATLAS for \(H\to 4l\) sector. In contrast with CMS [9], a preliminary particle level analysis [4] showed that Inner bremsstrahlung effects on the acceptances and \(\sigma_{M}\) are small in ATLAS. A detector full simulation using the technical proposal (T.P.) geometry with hybrid solution for the calorimeter, has been performed to evaluate precisely these effects. Inner bremsstrahlung was generated using the PHOTOS package interfaced with PYTHIA 5.7.

PHOTOS (that has been tuned with LEP experiments), uses the leading-logarithmic (collinear) approximation to generate QED bremsstrahlung with a proper soft photon behaviour reproduced [5]. Taking a \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) decay from PYTHIA banks, it generates a \(\gamma\) radiation with the correct kinematics for emitted particules coming from this vertex, ensuring energy momentum conservation in the whole JETSET shower.

A low energy cut on photons is fixed in PHOTOS at \(0.01\times m_{Z}\), whereas it is 1 GeV in PYTHIA.

This inner bremsstrahlung will thus be a bit different from PYTHIA one which relies on the standard JETSET parton shower on outgoing leptons[6][7].

Interfacing PHOTOS with PYTHIA consists only on a call to a few routines for PHOTOS initialisation and current event modification [11].

The PYTHIA QED radiative processes are switched off to evince any double-counting. In our situation, the interference term between the two outgoing leptons is used, but only the single bremsstrahlung process is selected, allowing at most one photon emission per Z.

Simulations were performed with \(m_{H}=130,170\) GeV, for \(m_{t}=170\) GeV.

In the analysis, the acceptances and resolutions of the whole sample of the eventsare compared to the same quantities for events for which no bremsstrahlung has occured.

## 3 Particle Level

### Preliminaries to the analysis

#### 3.1.1 Detector response parametrisation

Before starting any analysis task, the 4 leptons momenta are modified to include the 2 T field effect, and in the same time electrons or photons arriving in the crack (\(1.375<\eta<1.525\) rad) are removed.

The electron or the photon energy is smeared using the electromagnetic calorimeter. The parametrisation of the calorimeter energy response, evaluated on a previous detector full simulation, is used to apply a smeared energy to these leptons and photons.

So the cluster energy is smeared according to :

\[\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{0.12}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{0.3\ GeV}{E}\oplus 0.01\ (E\ in\ GeV)\]

In the same spirit, **Muons**' 4-momentum is smeared using the tracker resolution. The following tracker parametrisation is used :

\[\frac{\Delta p_{T}}{p_{T}}=0.0005\times p_{T}\ \oplus\ 0.012\ (p_{T}\ in\ GeV)\]

Both parametrisations are indicative and are mostly useful to evaluate the potential loss in acceptance in a given mass bin (\(m_{H}\ \pm 2\sigma\)).

When it is possible, the effect due to inner bremsstrahlung is corrected using the protocol defined in the next section.

#### 3.1.2 Selection criteria

The cuts are defined according to the TP [1]:

* Geometrical Cuts on \(p_{T}\), \(\eta\) (\(\eta<2.5\), two leptons with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV, two others leptons with \(p_{T}>7\) GeV). The coverage in rapidity up to \(\eta=2.5\) corresponds to the range covered by the inner detector. Above this value no track reconstruction is possible, implying no vertexing to reject \(Zb\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}\), and there is also no efficient electron identification. Moreover the gain in acceptance is small (Fig. 1). The cuts on the leptons \(p_{T}\), used for triggering (\(p_{T}>20\) GeV) or for reducing the background (\(p_{T}>7\) GeV), have been shown to be almost optimal [4].
* Two of these leptons of appropriate charge and flavor, must have an invariant mass pointing to the Z mass \((m_{l_{1}l_{2}}=m_{Z}\pm 6\) GeV). The two others are then required to have invariant mass greater than 20 GeV (\(m_{l_{1}l_{4}}>20\) GeV). Forcing \(m_{ll}\) to point to \(m_{Z}\) is necessary to reduce the non resonant \(t\Gamma\) background, whereas the \(m_{l_{1}l_{2}}>20GeV\) condition reduces both the contributions from cascade decay to the \(Zb\bar{b}\) background and the contribution from the \(\gamma^{*}\) pole to the irreducible \(ZZ^{*}\) background [4][1].
* Cuts on a window around \(m_{H}\pm 2\sigma\)

This will be completed in ATLAS with isolation and impact parameter cuts, allowing to reduce both \(t\Gamma\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) backgrounds below the \(ZZ^{*}/\gamma\) continuum [3].

The inner bremsstrahlung contribution is evaluated on :

* Acceptance of the mass window cut around \(m_{Z}\).
* Acceptance of the mass window cut around \(m_{H}\).
* Overall Acceptance.
* Mass resolution.

### Studies

For \(m_{H}=130\) GeV :

The \(H\to 4e\) generated sample contains 4668 events preselected (four leptons with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV, \(\eta<2.9\)). 1753 (38%) are without radiated photon and consistitutes our reference sample. (Fig. 2).

For \(H\to 4\mu\) sample 1304 events preselected with the same cuts as for electrons were generated, 832 (63%) are without radiated photon (Fig. 2).

The transverse impulsion of radiated photons is shown in Fig. 3 for electrons and in Fig. 4 for muons. One should notice the value of the mean \(p_{T}\) of radiated photons which is relatively important for both the electrons and the muons (\(<p_{T}>=5.6\) GeV). The distributions of the photons distances to the closest lepton (\(R=\sqrt{(\eta_{\gamma}-\eta_{l})^{2}+(\phi_{\gamma}-\phi_{l})^{2}}\)) are also shown in these figures.

Due to the difference of mass beteween electrons and muons, there are more photons emitted by electrons than for photons.

#### 3.2.1 Accounting for inner bremsstrahlung photons

Events without bremsstrahlung are reconstructed using directly electrons or muons momenta.

When a radiation has occured, one has to take into account the photon :

Electrons

If the photon is emitted close to the electron on the calorimeter, only one cluster is reconstructed and the combined 4-momentum is measured. In the analysis we consider a critical distance R between the electron and the photon. With \(\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}<\)_R_ the photon is effectively absorbed in the electron cluster.

We are working with \(R\) = 0.07. This corresponds approximatively to the size of a 5x5 cluster in ATLAS. The impact of this value is discussed in the next section. Out of this cone, only hard photons will be reconstructed by calorimetry. If such a photon is reconstructed, its 4-momentum of the photon is added to the nearest electron cluster. A \(p_{t_{min}}\) = 7 GeV value has been chosen as the minimum transverse momentum required to reconstruct efficiently the photon with the electromagnetic calorimeter. The effect of this threshold will be studied in the next section. The events are analysed for the case where only the photons in the cone contribute to the total cluster energy, and for the case where the hard photons are also accounted for.

muons

In the case of muons final state, only hard photons are taken into account by summing their 4-momentum to the nearest muon. Accounting for low energy photons by collecting the energy in a cluster around the muon would be spoiled by the noise and the energy resolution of the calorimeter.

#### 3.2.2 Results

Figure 5 (resp. 6) show the evolution of the Higgs mass distributions due to inner bremsstrahlung for _H_\(\rightarrow\)_4\(e\) (resp. _H_\(\rightarrow\)_4_\(\mu\)) signal, taking into account or not the detector resolution. Important tails appear at energies when inner bremsstrahlung photons are not collected.

\(m_{H}\) = 130 GeVResults for the electrons are summarized in table 1. The total loss of acceptance between the samples without bremsstrahlung and with "corrected" bremsstrahlung is 8.1%. The resolution on Higgs mass rises from 1.51 \(\pm\) 0.06 GeV without bremsstrahlung to \(1.65\pm 0.05\) GeV when photons in the cone and high _p_T ones are accounted for.

For muons (table 2), the loss on the overall acceptance is 9% (using only the correction of high energy photons). The _m_H resolution which is \(1.75\pm 0.1\) GeVwithout bremsstrahlung, is 1.70 GeV for the bremsstrahlung case.

\(m_{H}=170\) GeV

This change implies no important modification of the acceptance. With the same mass bin for the \(m_{H}\) window, the loss in acceptance becomes 7.8% for the 4 electrons final state and 8% for the 4 muons final state.

For this mass, \(\sigma_{m_{H}}\) is of course larger. With bremsstrahlung corrected it is \(1.95\pm 0.06\) GeV for the electrons (Fig. 8) and \(2.2\pm 0.08\)Gev for the muons (Fig. 9). Without bremsstrahlung \(\sigma_{m_{H}}\) is \(1.85\pm 0.06\) GeV for the electrons and \(2.1\pm 0.08\) GeV for the muons.

#### 3.2.3 Clustering parameters effects

The influence of R and \(p_{t_{min}}\) on the acceptance has been studied for \(m_{H}=130\)GeV.

The effect of varying the cone in which soft photons are collected for \(H\to 4e\), without any account for the outer photons, shows the dependance on the cluster size of the acceptances to \(m_{z}\) and \(m_{H}\) windows and the overall acceptance (table 3, Fig. 7 first line). With \(R=0\) no photon is included in the electron cluster, this is the raw effect of inner bremsstrahlung on the acceptance.

Fig.. 7 points out that the transition between the situation where there is no cone (R=0.), and the case for which a R=0.07 cone is used, induces a variation of the overall acceptance from 66% to 86%.

In the region of R=0.07 the variation of acceptance is not negligeable (80.8% for R=0.035, 88% for R=1.). As acceptance is dependent of this cluster size, the field value is important. Increasing field takes away photons from electrons. A study on the CMS detector [8], which uses a 4T central magnetic field, shows more significant impacts of Inner Bremsstrahlung than in ATLAS 2T Field (See also [4]). Changing the magnetic field from 2T to 4T (without any changes to EM calorimeter properties) conduces for \(H\to 4e\) events to a 12% loss on the overall acceptance in regard to the no bremsstrahlung situation (it is 8% for 2T).

The importance of the \(p_{t_{min}}\) threshold has also been studied (table 4, 5, and Fig. 7 bottom). For 4e events, photons in a R=0.07 cone have been accounted for, and then for both 4e and 4mu events, photons momenta with \(p_{T}\) above the threshold added to the closest lepton.

For low values of \(p_{t_{min}}\) the effect on overall acceptance is bigger for muons than for electrons due to absence of any cone correction.

### Particle Level Conclusion

At particle level, the inner bremsstrahlung effect on the acceptance is below 10% for electrons and for muons, and this for a 130 GeV Higgs as for a 170 Gev Higgs. To confirm these effects, and to evaluate more precisely the impact on the mass resolution, a full detector simulation for a 130 GeV Higgs has been performed (From the results of the particle level analysis we assume that the 170 Gev Higgs case will not be very different from the 130 GeV one).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

## 4 Full Simulation

Particle level analysis relied on the assumption that a part of the emitted photons can be accounted for when they are in a cone \(R<0.07\) around an electron, or when they have a high \(p_{T}\) (\(p_{T}>7\)GeV).

To confirm the validity of these hypothesis and consequently the results of the particle level analysis, a full simulation of ATLAS has been performed using the DICE framework for the T.P. layout :

* Presampler + \(\eta\) strips for the accordion calorimeter.
* Panel layout and B-layer for the tracker.

### Samples used

#### 4.1.1 4\(e\) final state

2997 events preselected (4 electrons with : \(p_{T}>6\) GeV, \(\eta<2.9\)) have been simulated. 424 (38%) are without radiated photon.

Photons outside of the cone with \(p_{T}>p_{T}^{min}\) contribute to energy of the closest electron. The 100 % is not reached for the overall acceptance, because of bad association of photons to electrons, or because of a loss of some radiating electrons in the crack.

#### 4.1.2 4\(\mu\) final state

1304 events preselected are available. 420 (64%) are without bremsstrahlung radiation.

### Reconstruction

#### 4.2.1 Electrons

Electrons and photons are reconstructed using a \(3\times 7\) in \(\eta\times\phi\) (\(0.075\times 0.175\)) clusterization algorithm on the electromagnetic calorimeter, to take into account the opening of the shower in \(\phi\) due to the magnetic field. The photons emitted closely to electrons are then automatically collected during the clusterization. The pile-up and noise are added by smearing on the reconstructed momenta.

#### 4.2.2 Muons

They have been reconstructed using only the tracker information with I. Gravlienko's program [10].

### Analysis

As it will be possible in the future to compute the polar angle using the impact on the calorimeter and the Z vertex position, insuring extremely good angular resolution (fraction of mrad); angles have been caculated using the particle level information for the electrons.

On the contrary, for muons, \(\theta\) and \(\phi\) are computed from tracker informations.

#### 4.3.1 Electrons

The study of the electrons including noise and constant term (0.7% ) but no pile-up for low luminosity physics (as in the T.P.), shows a loss on the overall acceptance of 10.9 % between the events without bremsstrahlung and the events with accounting for reconstructed bremsstrahlung photons (table 6, Fig. 10). The resolution on the Higgs mass is about constant no significant increase (\(1.49\pm 0.06\) GeV to \(1.53\pm 0.06\) GeV).

As expected, including the pile-up contribution changes slightly the results (table 7). The loss in overall acceptance is 10.4 %. The resolution on the Higgs mass, stays also constant (\(1.69\ \pm\ 0.09\) GeV )(Fig.. 11).

The resolutions on the Higgs mass (\(\sigma_{low}\simeq 1.5\) GeV, and \(\sigma_{High}=1.69\) GeV) should be compared to the T.P. values (\(\sigma_{low}^{T.P.}=1.7\) GeV, and \(\sigma_{High}^{T.P.}=1.9\) GeV).

The improvement is due to a better description of the detector geometry in the simulation (hybrid calorimeter for the present simulation against separated preshower at the time of the T.P.), and to a better evaluation of the noise.

#### 4.3.2 Muons

Concerning the muons, without pile-up on the reconstructed photons (table 8, Fig. 12), the loss in acceptance is 6.5%, and the standard alone mass resolution of the tracker is 1.96 \(\pm\) 0.09 GeV.

Including pile-up for the photons (table 9), does not change, with a loss in overall acceptance which is now 7%.

### Conclusion

The potential effects of the inner bremsstrahlung on \(H\to 4l\) channel, have been investigated using particle level analysis and detector full simulation. The detector full simulation is in agreement with the particle level analysis, and shows rather small effect on the overall acceptance and on the Higgs mass resolution.

The loss in acceptance with respect to the no bremsstrahlung case, is found to be 10.9 % for electrons and 7% for muons. The particle level studies showed that this loss in acceptance is about constant on the full \(m_{H}\) range 130-170 GeV. The particle level analysis has also emphasized the dependence of inner bremsstrahlung effects reduction, on the capability to account for the photons close to the electrons.

The resolution on the Higgs mass is not affected (at least with the present statistics) by inner bremsstrahlung. For electrons, it is \(\sigma_{m_{H}}\simeq 1.5\) GeV for low luminosity period, and \(\sigma_{m_{H}}=1.7\) GeV at high luminosity. For muons, the tracker stand alone resolution is \(\sigma=1.96\) GeV.

Due to a better description of the geometry of the calorimeter, the mass resolution in the 4e mode has improved by 13% with respect to the T.P. value.
