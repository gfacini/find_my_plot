## 1 Introduction

The quality of the muon measurement has been one of the guiding design criteria for the ATLAS experiment. This concern is reflected by the choice of the main components of the muon spectrometer, and in particular of the system of three large air-core, superconducting toroid magnets, which, combined with high-precision tracking detectors, provide robust, high resolution, stand-alone muon performance over a \(\mathrm{P_{T}}\) range from 5 to 1000 GeV/c.

The performance requirements and the design parameters of the muon spectrometer were presented in detail in the ATLAS Technical Proposal [1], as have the general features of the toroidal magnet system. Since then, much more detailed optimization has taken place. But the general concept of the spectrometer, and in particular its overall magnetic configuration and the basic concepts underlying the magnet engineering design, have remained qualitatively (albeit not always quantitatively) unchanged; such issues are considered settled by now.

However, a number of technological simplifications (accompanied by reductions in both performance and cost) have been recently introduced in the magnet design [2, 3], and more extensive design studies have been initiated in several technological areas.

This is the context in which the ATLAS management organizes a Preliminary Design Review (PDR) of the ATLAS Magnet System, to be held in June 1996. A set of Reference Design Reports (RDR) is being assembled by the magnet engineering teams of the Barrel Toroid (BT), End-cap Toroids (ECTs), Solenoid, and Common Areas in preparation for this review.

The present document is intended as a summary of the requirements imposed on the design of the Toroid System both by the physics performance of the Atlas muon spectrometer (Sec. 2), and by the fact that, much more so than for a solenoid, many design aspects of the toroid magnets and of the muon instrumentation are deeply intertwined (Sec. 3). The report also presents, as a contribution to the review process, a "snapshot" of the physics performance (Sec. 4) calculated for the baseline spectrometer design as currently planned. It concludes (Sec. 5) with a (not necessarily exhaustivel) summary of the pending issues related to the physics performance of Atlas, and to the interface between the toroid magnets and the rest of the experimental apparatus, that remain to be settled by the magnet engineering teams and the ATLAS Muon Group.

## 2 Physics-related requirements

### Physics objectives and general design guidelines

Performance requirements and design parameters of the spectrometer follow from the physics program and the LHC background environment [1]. Good momentum resolution, comparable for electrons and muons, with full phase space coverage, is essential for the detection of decays such as H -> ZZ* -> 4\(\mathrm{\mu}\) above large backgrounds, or of Z -> \(\mathrm{\mu}\)\(\mathrm{\mu}\) (or of any new narrow state not predicted to date).

These two processes: the intermediate mass Higgs, and a heavy gauge boson decaying into two muons, will be used in this report to provide benchmarks of the muon spectrometer performance.

In this spirit, the design guidelines suggested by the physics objectives can be outlined as follows.

* Unambiguously observing the mass peak associated with a new gauge boson \(\mathrm{Z}\)' that would decay into two muons with \(\mathrm{P_{T}}\sim 1000\) GeV, leads to requiring a transverse momentum resolution \(\mathrm{\Delta P_{T}}\) /\(\mathrm{P_{T}}\) of 10 % or better in that kinematic range. This dictates the combination of bending power in the central rapidity region (see Sec. 2.2), and the precision (\(\sim 50\)\(\mathrm{\mu}\)\(\mathrm{m}\)) with which the muon instrumentation can measure the sagitta of the particles. This precision, in turn, is the main consideration determining the chamber resolution, the calibration of the alignment system, and some aspects of the chamber layout; the last two points lead to some of the demands imposed on the Barrel Toroid (see Secs. 2.5 & 3.2).
* Resolving the very narrow mass distribution of the intermediate Higgs decaying to 4 muons with transverse momenta in the 10-100 GeV/c range, and which is produced with low cross-section amidst severe backgrounds, leads to the following requirements:
* A rapidity coverage extending up to \(\mathrm{\eta}\sim 2.5\)-2.7; this leads to minimizing the bore of the End-cap Toroid, in a manner compatible with shielding requirements.
* An average transverse momentum resolution \(\mathrm{\Delta P_{T}}\) /\(\mathrm{P_{T}}\) of about 2 % for \(\mathrm{P_{T}}\)\(\sim 10\)-100 GeV/c, approximately constant over the entire rapidity range. The fact that the resolution should remain uniform up to high rapidity is one of the fundamental reasons for selecting a toroidal magnetic configuration. The very demanding level of resolution, combined with the field strength that is achievable at reasonable cost, leads to the choice of an air-core magnet, and places stringent requirements on the nature, amount and distribution of material (magnet structural elements, muon instrumentation) in the toroid volume (see Sec. 2.4).
* The 4-body decay of the Higgs implies the usable event rate degrades as the fourth power of the single-muon acceptance. It is therefore essential to minimize with great care the fraction of phase space where muons are not well measured (dead zones with no muon coverage, gaps in 3-chamber coverage, compensation for reverse field effects in the BT-ECT transition region), as discussed in Secs. 2.3, 4.3 and 4.4.
* Operating the ATLAS detector in the hostile LHC environment imposes to limit the flux, inside and around the detector, of neutrons and photons produced by p-p interaction products hitting the beam pipe. This leads to surrounding part of the beam line with a massive amount of shielding, some of which must be installed in the inner bore of the ECTs. This topic is studied within the context of the ECT engineering and forward region integration groups, and will not be elaborated upon further in the present report.

### Momentum resolution and magnetic configuration

One can distinguish three regimes in transverse momentum resolution.

* At high momentum (\(\mathrm{P_{T}}\)\(>300\) GeV), the resolution is dominated by the precision (related to the number of chambers crossed by the particle and the spatial resolution of these chambers) with which the magnetic deflection is measured, as compared to the actual magnitude of that deflection (which is related to the field integral along the particle trajectory). This regime is responsible for the constraints imposed by the alignment system (Sec. 2.5); it is also particularly sensitive to holes in the 3-point acceptance (see Sec. 4.4).
* At intermediate momenta (30 GeV/c \(<\) P\({}_{\rm T}\)\(<\) 300 GeV/c), the resolution is increasingly dominated by multiple scattering. The impact of the latter depends on the bending power of the magnet, and on the amount and distribution of material traversed by the track. This regime, which is that of the H \(\sim\) 4\(\mu\) decay, leads to constraints on radiative material (Sec. 2.4), on single-muon acceptance (Sec. 2.3), and on special chamber layout needs in the transition region.
* For P\({}_{\rm T}\)\(<\) 30 GeV/c, the stand-alone resolution becomes dominated by muon energy loss fluctuations in the calorimeter, which occur before that muon can be measured in the spectrometer.

Design guidelines relative to conductor layout, as seen from the viewpoint of magnetic configuration and physics performance, can be summarized as follows (the recommendations below apply to both the BT and the ECT).

* The minimum conductor radius should be kept as close as possible to the minimum external radius of the magnet; in particular, the radial extent of thermal shields, cryostat stiffening fins, etc. should be minimized in order to take advantage of the 1/R dependence of the field. Similarly, the maximum conductor radius should be as close as possible to the outer magnet envelope.
* For the same reason, the height of the conductor stack (influenced e.g. by the radial extension of the aluminum stabilizer) should be minimized, consistent with stability and/or magnet protection requirements.
* together with that of the coil casing and cryostat
- should be minimized in order to limit the fraction of multiple-scattering dominated phase space. The optimum cannot be determined directly from first principles, but rather from the quantitative study of the impact of the above-mentioned parameters on the momentum resolution in its various regimes.
* The magnetic coverage of the BT and ECT's must overlap as much as possible. While in principle capable of providing a slightly more uniform field map, the configuration where each ECT coil is in the same plane as the corresponding BT coil was abandoned, because the minimum possible distance between the BT and ECT conductor stacks lead to unacceptably large regions with no or very low field. In the chosen configuration, where the BT and ECT coils alternate around the azimuth, the relative radial penetration of an ECT coil in-between the two BT coils should be maximized in order to optimize field quality. In the present design, the maximum radius of the ECT conductor stack is limited by the radial space needed between the coil casing and the outside of the ECT cryostat, and by the interference between the ECT cryostat and the BT voussoirs, whose radius, as discussed in Sec. 2.4, should be as low as possible.

A global optimization of the magnetic and muon chamber layout in the barrel region has been completed recently [4]; a re-optimization of the ECT magnetic configuration, leading to the suppression of intermediate conductor loops and the introduction of double-pancake windings in the ECT, has also taken place [5]. It is beyond the scope of the present document to detail those arguments here.

In brief, the magnetic configuration as currently proposed appears satisfactory from the viewpoint of available bending power and field distribution. Its parameters, as well as the corresponding field maps and field integrals, are presented in Secs. 4.1 and 4.2.1. The accuracy with which the field must be known, and the method proposed to achieve this accuracy, are briefly described in Sec. 4.2.2.

### Muon acceptance

The efficiency for observing H \(\text{->}\) 4\(\upmu\) decays is proportional to the fourth power of the single-muon acceptance. For low Higgs masses (below about 200 GeV) this acceptance can be defined as the fraction of phase space, measured in units of pseudorapidity \(\upeta\) x azimuth \(\upphi\), in which the muon momentum is properly measured. When the mass of the hunted particle increases, e.g. for higher Higgs masses or for Z' bosons in the TeV mass range, this single-muon acceptance becomes more properly quantified by the fraction of the total (4\(\uppi\)) solid angle with good momentum measurement.

The momentum measurement is considered "good" when the particle traverses three or more chambers so that its sagitta can be measured. The fraction of phase space over which this is possible is called the "3-point acceptance". The measurement is still possible, but significantly degraded, when the muon track crosses only two layers of chambers; this corresponds to the so-called angle-angle measurement1, which uses the ability of muon chambers to measure the track direction. This leads to the concept of "2-point acceptance". It is clear that the maximization of the overall acceptance results from an optimization of the chamber layout which is itself closely related to the mechanical design of the toroid system.

Footnote 1: The spacer heights currently adopted for the BI, BM and BO chambers are such that while the BM-BO measurement is mostly angle-angle, a measurement involving only BI and BO is more of the point-angle type.

The main sources of acceptance loss (BT ribs that take up magnetic forces within each coil, feet and pillars supporting internal subdetectors and toroid coils off the ground, service holes for cables and cryogenic pipes, edge effects and chamber boundaries, possibly muon detector supports) have to be minimized in size, and wherever possible arranged so that holes in consecutive chamber layers are never aligned along a projective path originating at the p-p vertex. Of particular relevance in the case of the BT are the shape and dimensions of the ribs linking the inner and outer conductor tracks. Here the preferred shape is that of a rib which is narrow in z (along the beam direction), even at the cost of being slightly wider in azimuth.

In the transition region between the BT and ECT regions, special care must be given to the placement of chambers in connection with the rather complex distribution of the magnetic field in this area. In some places, cancellation of the field integral may occur, resulting in very poor momentum measurement with either the sagitta or the angle-angle methods. In such a case, the addition of a fourth chamber at a well chosen location should be made possible if it leads to a significant improvement of the momentum resolution.

In the end-cap region, the acceptance in limited by the minimal polar angle at which the bending power and the muon track measurement remain usable. A coverage up to pseudorapidity of at least 2.5 is required for an efficient search of the light Higgs, and for the identification and sign measurement of very high energy forward muons expected in some physics scenarios (coverage up to \(\eta\)=3 would be almost ideal). Forward acceptance is also limited by the necessity to support the neutron and photon shielding that is also an integral part (about 100 tons per ECT magnet) of the mechanical structure of the toroid.

The current understanding of the single muon acceptance, based on the magnet geometry and muon chamber layout of May 1996, is presented in Sec. 4.3.

### Radiative transparency

For a given muon momentum, multiple Coulomb scattering in magnet or detector structures degrade the resolution in a manner that depends on:

* the amount of material traversed (expressed in terms of the number of radiation lengths);
* the fraction of phase space occulted by this material; and
* the distribution of this material along the particle trajectory (the worst case corresponding to an accumulation of material close to the middle of the track, where the scattering-induced deflection is indistinguishable from the magnetic deflection averaged over the length of the track).

Specifically, in the Barrel Toroid,
* material obstructions such as conductor blocks, coil cryostat, voussoirs, struts, stiffeners are more damaging the closer they lie to the middle (BM) chamber. It is therefore required to minimize the mean radius of the voussoirs, and to maximize the mean radius of the struts and of the stiffeners bracing the strut planes.
* Material obstructions damage the resolution (in the multiple-scattering limited domain) in proportion of the fraction of \(\eta\times\phi\) space they cover. It is therefore required to minimize the dimensions (width, height) of voussoirs, struts and stiffeners, as well as the overall azimuthal width of the Barrel coil cryostats. Holes in structural elements (e.g. in the voussoirs) help reduce the fraction of phase space affected; but, as a more complicated geometry leads to more complex track fitting procedures, a low and continuous voussoir may be preferable to a voussoir occupying the full available space and with a man-hole in the middle. The ultimate criterion is the comparison of the momentum resolution functions calculated for the two cases.
* Material obstructions damage the resolution (in the multiple-scattering limited domain) as the square root of the radiative thickness \(L_{R}\), defined as the ratio of the mechanical thickness \(L\) (expressed in cm) to the radiation length of the material \(X_{0}\) (also in cm): \(L_{R}\) =\(L/X_{0}\). Therefore, voussoirs, struts, stiffeners, etc.....(or their walls, if hollow) should be as thin as possible. Long radiation length materials such as aluminum (\(X_{0}\)=8.9 cm) are preferred over materials such as steel (\(X_{0}\)=1.8 cm). For example, for a layout similar to the one presented in Sec. 4, the fractional difference in average momentum resolution, for \(P_{T}\) =100 GeV/c and 0 \(<\eta<1\), is 18 to 25 % when comparing Aluminum voussoirs & struts with their stainless steel counterparts of identical dimensions [6].

Combining the above requirements suggests the definition of a rough figure of merit for the material in the Barrel Toroid. In the case of the voussoirs, for instance, the quantity \(\rm(W_{y}^{\rm vouss}+W_{z}^{\rm vouss})\) (width in y, z) \(\rm x\) (\(\rm r^{\rm vouss}\) - \(\rm r^{\rm BI}\) ) / (\(\rm r^{\rm vouss}\) - \(\rm r^{\rm BM}\) ) (radial position) \(\rm x\) SQRT(\(\rm L_{R}^{\rm vouss})\) (radiative thickness) should be kept as small as possible.

In the End-cap Toroid, vacuum vessel walls should be kept as thin as possible, as all forward muons traverse these. In addition, cold mass material (coil casing, webs, support beams) should also be minimized wherever structurally possible. An updated radiative thickness map of the ECT will be necessary to evaluate the forward momentum resolution in a manner more realistic than what was done so far.

### Muon chamber alignment

The high level of accuracy required on the sagitta measurement (a few tens of microns) imposed the implementation of a sophisticated optical system to align chambers belonging to different layers. It is based on light rays which mimic infinite momentum muon tracks and connect optical sensors, mounted on the chambers and positioned with very high accuracy with respect to chamber fiducials.

In the BT, the chamber layout and their sizes are constrained, apart from acceptance considerations, by projectivity conditions dictated by the alignment algorithm. In addition, space must be reserved, in each half-octant, for 2x4 projective alignment corridors around the light rays, approximately 5 cm in diameter, and located between the inner (before the toroid) and outer (behind the toroid) chamber layers. These corridors of course avoid traversing coil cryostats; but holes in warm structures (voussoirs, struts) should be made possible when so required by the geometry of the chamber layout. At the time of this writing, alignment corridors as currently foreseen must traverse one (possibly two) voussoirs per half octant, and possibly one strut. Stiffeners in the strut planes will have to be positioned so as to clear these corridors.

In the transition and end-cap regions, the alignment philosophy is slightly different. It relies on almost projective laser beams which connect approximately radial carbon fiber bars holding optical sensors (two such bars per octant are also required in the BT). The chambers are then positioned with respect to the bars using other optical systems. Although this scheme minimizes the number of pseudo-projective laser beams, there is need for a light path at \(\eta\)\(\sim\)2.2-2.4 (the larger \(\eta\), the better) in every second octant. Eventually these 8 corridors have to traverse the ECT cryostat, while avoiding parasitic and uncontrolled light deflection by thermal gradients, misaligned vacuum-tight optical windows, or other refractive effects. The possible impact of these light paths on the required precision and reproducibility of the angular positioning of the ECT cryostats, remains to be investigated.

As many chambers are mounted on the warm structure of the toroids, the stability of this structure has to fulfill rather stringent requirements imposed by alignment procedures that make use of muon tracks. For instance, whereas the towers of large chambers are aligned by optical systems, it is planned to align the towers of small chambers with respect to the neighboring large-chamber towers using reconstructed muon tracks traversing the overlapping regions in large and small chambers. As it will take typically an hour to accumulate sufficient statistics, the relative position of a small chamber with respect to its large neighbors must be stable, over this period, within better than 20 microns. In addition, large amplitude vibrations of magnet and muon spectrometer structures must be very carefully avoided, especially in the frequency range above 50 Hz as they may lead to resonance effects on drift chamber wires with very large Q-factors.

## 3 Magnet-detector interface requirements

### Envelopes

Envelope dimensions for the toroid magnet system, as defined in Ref. [7], and as fixed by the ATLAS CB in March 1996, are recalled in Table I. They are severely constrained by the performance specifications of the internal ATLAS subdetectors (inner tracker, electromagnetic calorimeter, hadron calorimeter), by the necessity to fully absorb hadronic debris before they reach the muon chambers, and by the cost of the muon spectrometer and of the experimental hall.

### Compatibility of toroid structures and services with the muon chamber layout

The layout of muon detectors, as presently designed, is shown in Figs. 1 to 5. It results from a careful optimization, with criteria given by

* single-muon acceptance;
* optimized material distribution of detector elements;
* muon momentum resolution in the high and intermediate \(\mathrm{P_{T}}\) regimes.
* alignment system constraints (projectivity of chamber boundaries, optical alignment corridors, carbon fiber bars);
* mechanical compatibility between detector elements, magnet structures, magnet service lines and diagnostic equipment, feet and supports.

The chamber layout is deeply intertwined with the magnet design, and, for fixed overall detector envelopes, directly impacted by parameters such as (the list below is not exhaustive):

* the number of voussoirs and struts;
* the radial and longitudinal positions, the radial height, and the shape of the voussoirs;

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|} \hline Barrel Toroid: & \\ \hline Stay-clear inner radius (mm) & 4700 \\ \hline Stay-clear outer radius (mm) & 10040 \\ \hline Overall length of coil cryostat (mm) & 25260 \\ \hline End-cap toroids: & \\ \hline Inner radius (mm) & 825 \\ \hline Stay-clear outer radius (mm) & 5350 \\ \hline Overall length of coil cryostat (mm) & 5000 \\ \hline Location of forward cryostat edge (mm) & 12630 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table I: Envelope dimensions of toroid magnetsthe radial and longitudinal positions, the radial height, and the shape of the struts;
* the position and the dimensions of the BT ribs (size of BMS chambers, projectivity constraints, alignment corridors);
* the outer diameter and the shape of the ECT cryostat;
* the rails, pillars, and other supporting fixtures in certain sectors (acceptance);
* the location and size of the cryogenic ring, current leads, phase separator, turrets, and other magnet services;
* the detailed layout of the axial force transfer structures;
* fins, rings, and other mechanical stiffeners that locally protrude from the warm structure of the Barrel Toroid;
* possibly the size and location of the strut stiffeners, which may impact the layout of some alignment corridors;
* the position and size of vacuum pumps, diagnostic equipment such as crates and racks (if mounted on the BT), etc.

It is therefore clear that any change, be it seemingly minor, in the mechanical envelope of the toroids (mostly for the Barrel) can significantly impact the muon detector layout; the reverse is also true.

A major milestone of the muon spectrometer is to "freeze" its detector layout by September 1996, so as to be able to fix the dimensions of the various chambers that will be built. At the time of this writing, only few mechanical conflicts between the BT and the detector layout remain, and these are being actively worked on. On the other hand, the design of the warm structure of the BT is still likely to evolve in a number of ways [8]. Should these detailed design studies suggest modifications of the mechanical envelope of the magnet, it will be necessary to take into account already existing constraints linked to the detector layout.

### Muon detector supports

A large fraction of the muon detectors (precision chambers: MDT's or CSC's; trigger/second coordinate chambers: RPC's or TGC's) will have to be supported off the warm structure of either the Barrel or End-cap Toroids. This puts additional loads on the magnet structure; for instance, the total chamber weight to be supported off the Barrel Toroid is approximately 550 tons (including cables and electronics).

In addition, the specifications of these chamber supports, their detailed design, and their mounting on the magnet cryostats, will require close collaboration between CERN, the Magnet Laboratories, and possibly some of the Atlas institutions responsible for muon detector construction. While the conceptual design of this system is still at an early stage, a very preliminary set of requirements is listed in Appendix I as an illustration of what might be needed.

A general issue associated with detector supports (as well as with services, see Sec. 3.7) is that of the deformation of the BT structure when the magnet is powered. All detector components attached to the magnet (chamber supports, pipes, cables) must take account the fact that the voussoir ring will move inwards, by several mm, when the magnet is powered; slight azimuthal displacements of the BT coils may also occur because of imperfect azimuthal symmetry.

Similarly, the ECT vacuum vessel will undergo small deformations when the magnets are powered.

**3.4 Muon detector installation**

It is foreseen to install the muon detectors of the inner and middle barrel layers by sliding the chambers on (possibly temporary) supports, along the beam direction, from either end of the magnet. Therefore, there should exist no mechanical obstacles within the BT volume that would impede axial chamber displacement. The outer chamber layer may be installed in a similar fashion, or may take place by bringing the chambers in from the sides.

The installation procedure, the necessary tooling, and the constraints these shall impose on local peculiarities of the magnet geometry are not known in detail at present. Detailed specifications and procedures will have to be worked out by CERN, in close consultation with the Magnet Laboratories. Similarly, as the detailed design of the Barrel Toroid progresses, there may also appear some changes in magnet envelopes, that interfere with the installation scheme as proposed. In all cases, potential performance impact (acceptance, radiative transparency) of proposed solutions may have to be evaluated by the Muon Group.

**3.5 Magnet alignment**

**3.5.1 Unbalanced forces induced by magnet misalignments.**

Radial offsets between the axes of the BT and either ECT induce radial forces between the two magnets; for misalignments in the few cm range, these forces are in the \(\sim\)5 ton range and not a source of concern. More significant is the torque that would arise from a relative azimuthal misalignment of BT and ECT coils. A 2 mrad rotation of an ECT with respect to the BT, which translates into an azimuthal positioning error of about 1 cm of the outermost ECT winding, induces a torque of about 100 ton-meters between toroids [1].

The implications of such force levels on the specifications of the mechanism used to reproducibly position the ECT with respect to the BT after a move of the former magnet, as well as the eventual need for initially adjusting the radial and azimuthal position of each ECT on its rail support, are a magnet engineering issue with no known mechanical implications for the rest of the Atlas detector. However, a number of other effects, listed below, and not yet fully studied, may have implications on the design of the above-mentioned support and/or adjustment systems.

**3.5.2 ECT positioning tolerances associated with optical alignment corridors.**

As mentioned in Sec. 2.5, these remain to be specified by the Muon Alignment team.

**3.5.3 Impact of relative BT-ECT misalignment on magnetic field reconstruction.**

While the principle of magnetic field reconstruction by a network of probes has been demonstrated in the Barrel region (Sec 4.2.2), the forward region remains to be studied. The coupled field configuration in the BT-ECT transition region, together with field gradients and second coordinate requirements which are more demanding than in the barrel, may imply positioning tolerances of the ECT cold mass inside its vacuum vessel, and of this vessel with respect to external references. Studies remain to be carried out by the Muon Working Group to assess the importance of this problem, and to establish the required level of tolerances.

### 3.6 Access and maintenance

Access and maintenance requirements are currently under study in ATLAS. This section is intended only as a broad outline of the issues involved; once fixed, the actual requirements will be formally specified by the Technical Coordinator.

#### 3.6.1 Maintenance of internal ATLAS detectors

Short maintenance periods, one to two weeks long, will take place a few (2-4) times per year, where access will be required to the front and/or back faces of the tracker and calorimeters. To this effect, the end-cap calorimeter will have to move away from the interaction point by approximately 4 m. Either ECT must be able to retract by a comparable amount, and then be brought back in operation, on a time scale consistent with the duration of the maintenance period.

During yearly shutdowns, which last several months, it may be necessary to remove and bring to the surface hall part or all of the inner tracker. Two scenarios are being considered at present. The first one involves moving an ECT on its rails close to the back wall of the underground hall, and then parking it laterally in a "garage" area. Concurrently, the end-cap calorimeter would be pulled back and also parked in a side position. The tracker would then be pulled axially out of the BT volume and lifted to the surface.

However, because of the difficulty of keeping the end-cap calorimeter cold during this process, an alternate scenario is currently being considered, where the end-cap calorimeter is pulled back by a few meters only, without disconnecting it from its cryogenic lines. In this case, inner detector modules (each about one-third the length of the full inner tracker) would be lifted to the surface in-between voussoirs of the Barrel Toroid. This would necessitate removing a number of muon chambers, as well as one voussoir and one strut of the BT.

The feasibility of both options is, at the time of this writing, still under study.

#### 3.6.2 Maintenance of the muon spectrometer

Access requirements to visit ports located on the vacuum vessels of either toroid magnet, and to the electrical, vacuum and cryogenic instrumentation installed on or near the coils, are being specified by the magnet engineering teams.

Maintenance of the muon instrumentation will require access to:

* chamber high voltage, preamplifiers, gas connections, and water connections, located along chamber azimuthal edges (i.e. near the magnet coils in the BT region). All three layers of both large and small chambers must be accessible;
* electronic boxes, located at discrete locations along azimuthal chamber edges;
* components associated with the optical alignment systems, typically located near chamber corners.

This imposes the following requirements:

* The installation of gangways and service platforms on the BT voussoirs and struts, and possibly at a few discrete points on the coil cryostats as well. Except in the top and bottom sectors, where such gangways are naturally horizontal, two levels (or "floors") will probably be necessary.
* The ability to service the chambers installed in-between ECT castellations ("BIE" chambers).
* The ability for people to "cross" the voussoirs and struts, i.e. to move freely along one octant (or possibly only one half-octant). This can be realized in one of two ways. Either the voussoir (or strut) is high enough to accommodate a man hole of diameter consistent with safety requirements [9]; or the radial extension of the voussoir (or strut) is sufficiently small that enough space is available, between that structural element and the neighboring muon chamber, to allow for safe passage of personnel (including under emergencyconditions). Because of the performance implications of the geometry chosen for voussoirs and struts (Sec. 2.4), the various solutions that may be considered will have to be compared not only from the structural, financial, and safety viewpoints, but also from that of their potential impact on physics performance.

### Subdetector services

The layout of service lines for all ATLAS subdetectors is the subject of detailed ongoing studies. This section is intended only as a broad outline of the issues involved; once fixed, the actual requirements will be formally specified by the TIE Group.

#### 3.7.1 Inner tracker, calorimeters, and solenoid

An inventory of services was recently compiled by M. Hatch [10], that provides first indications of what will be required.

A large number of these service lines are currently foreseen to be routed to the outside of the Atlas detector through a annular gap in the large muon chambers, located near \(\eta\)=0. Depending of where it is finally placed, this service gap will have a significant impact on the acceptance and/or the momentum resolution (Sec. 4.3); this optimization is currently in progress.

In the end-cap area, a curtain-like guiding system for movable service lines may be required.

#### 3.7.2 Muon spectrometer

Muon detectors will require various service lines to be routed along, and supported by, magnet structures:

* low voltage power lines;
* high voltage cables (possibly);
* signal cables (from tube ends to electronic boxes);
* data lines (from electronic boxes to remote racks);
* gas lines, separately for MDT, CSC, RPC and TGC chambers, and water cooling pipes. These will run along the chamber edges, and will also require a circular line near \(\eta\)=0 in the shadow of the voussoirs. Similar services will be necessary for transition region and forward chambers.

#### 3.7.3 Barrel Toroid

Of particular importance are the cryogenic ring and the phase separator, as they influence the muon chamber layout. Pipes connecting these to the outside should be located such as to minimize holes (and hence acceptance losses) in the outer muon chambers. It is therefore strongly preferred to have such pipes share the above-mentioned annular service gap.

Similarly, the coverage loss associated with the superconducting current leads should be minimized.

#### 3.7.4 End-cap Toroid

The ECT "turret", located atop each magnet, should be dimensioned, and its input pipes and buses laid out, so as to minimize acceptance holes in the muon detectors.

In addition, as the ECT will have to retract several times a year (Sec. 3.6.1), this access procedure should minimize the number of muon chambers to be moved or dismounted.

## 4. Present status of physics performance

### 4.1 Magnetic configuration

The magnetic configuration of the toroid system [12], as input to the field map calculation, is summarized in Tables 2 and 3 below and illustrated in Fig. 6.

### 4.2 Magnetic field

#### 4.2.1 Field map calculation

In principle, assuming that the coils are at the nominal positions described in the afore-mentioned tables, the calculation of the field map in an air-core magnet can be obtained by a straightforward application of the Biot-Savart law. However, the presence of magnetic material, such as the iron return yoke of the solenoid and the hadron calorimeter absorber plates and support structures, must be taken into account; this iron is itself affected by the return field of the solenoid. The full field calculation was therefore performed using a finite element method (TOSCA package), with all magnets (Barrel Toroid, End-cap Toroids, and Solenoid) turned on. Some of the results are illustrated in Figs. 7 and 8.

The radial dependence of the azimuthal component of the field (that induces the muon bending component usable for momentum measurement) is shown in Figs. 7a and 7b, corresponding respectively to two slices, perpendicular to the toroid axis and located at z=0 and z=10 m from the interaction point (IP). In each figure, the field is shown in an azimuthal plane containing a Barrel coil, and in a plane half-way in-between two Barrel coils (i.e. containing an End-cap coil). Fig. 7a shows that the contribution of the iron, although not negligible, remains at a manageable level.

The performance of the toroid system can be roughly quantified by the field integral experienced by particles originating from the IP and propagating in a straight line (infinite momentum limit). This "available bending power" is shown in Fig. 8 as a function of the pseudorapidity \(\eta\) for various values of the azimuth. It shows usable field coverage up to \(\eta\sim\) 2.5-2.7. The regions with low field integral, around \(\eta\)=1.35 and \(\eta\)=1.55, correspond to trajectories in,respectively, the plane of an End-cap coil and that of a Barrel coil, where the fringe field of one magnet largely cancels the bending power of the other.

#### 4.2.2 Reconstruction of the actual magnetic field

In practice, the coil positions and shapes will be unknown to within a few cm, due to fabrication tolerances and to deformations induced by the gravitational and magnetic loads. We present here a field map reconstruction procedure based on the recalculation of the actual position of the current-carrying conductors, with respect to a reference frame defined by an octant of large chambers (Fig. 9). To this effect, these chambers will be outfitted with sets of 2-dimensional (2D) or 3-dimensional (3D) magnetic probes.

The field components must be known to typically better than 30 Gauss. This requirement is mainly set by the need to limit the bending power uncertainty well below 0.5% (which would contribute a comparable amount to the momentum resolution), and by the accuracy of the Lorentz angle correction in the drift tubes, which is a quadratic function of all three local field components2. In addition, it may be necessary to take data with the toroids turned off in order to calibrate the alignment system; for such runs, the residual field integral would have to be known to better than 10 Gauss-meter. This sets the scale for the precision of the magnetic field probes which will be used to reconstruct the field map inside the Barrel Toroid volume. It also underlines the importance to avoid the use of any magnetic material in the construction of the muon spectrometer.

Footnote 2: This tolerance \(\Delta\)B is therefore inversely proportional to the B-field: \(\Delta\)B = 0.004/B where both B and \(\Delta\)B are in Tesla. See Minutes of the ATLAS Muon Detector Physics meeting, 16 January 1995.

The model studied so far deals only with the barrel region, but the principle should be extended to the complete toroid system. 2D magnetic probes, mounted on the chambers, are supposed to measure the B\({}_{\rm x}\) and B\({}_{\rm y}\) field components. They could be made of two Hall probes mounted at 90\({}^{\circ}\) to each other (for the full toroid system, 3D probes could be used in the regions where the B\({}_{\rm z}\) component cannot be neglected). In the reference frame defined by the chamber octant, the shape of each half-coil can be described by a number of nodes (10 in our model) with unknown random displacements in x and y, connected by straight sections (Fig. 9). For the Barrel Toroid, there are thus 160 variables which are assumed to be randomly and uniformly distributed between -2 cm and +2 cm. In addition, we have allowed for a global displacement of each coil along x and y within a + 1 cm range.

When the field map is calculated for each set of random variables, the distribution of field deviations (absolute value of true field - nominal field) shows, over a set of test points uniformly distributed in radius and azimuth over one octant, an average of 90 Gauss. This violates our requirements. In practice however, only the displacements of the two coils on either side of the octant have a non-negligible effect on the field inside this sector. This reduces the number of unknown parameters to 40. Using the mesh of magnetic probes placed on the chambers (84 two-dimensional probes per octant in our model, distributed in 7 locations along the beam direction), one can perform a \(\chi^{2}\) minimization over the 168 measured field values to determine the 40 unknown parameters. Assuming, rather conservatively, that the probes can be positioned to about 1 mm and 3 mrad with respect to chamber fiducials, and that their accuracy is better than 10 Gauss, the positions of the coil nodes can be reconstructed with a precision of about 1 mm. This results in a distribution of field deviations with an average of about 10 Gauss, which does meet our requirements.

In the next step, End-cap coils will be incorporated in the model. As a further refinement, the effect of the iron, taking into account the relative positioning of the coils with respect to the solenoid return yoke, also remains to be included.

### 4.3 Single muon acceptance

The chamber layout in the barrel region is shown in Figs. 1 to 3 for the standard octants, and in Figs. 4 and 5 for the feet area. Forward chamber layout is illustrated in Figs. 10 to 13.

In the barrel region, the chambers are arranged in projective towers of three layers. There are two kinds of towers, corresponding respectively to the coil region ("small" chambers) and the open space between two adjacent coils ("large" chambers). In standard octants, the main mechanical obstacles to chamber coverage are the radial coil ribs which connect the inner and outer segments of the racetrack-shaped casing; their impact on acceptance loss has been minimized by reducing the longitudinal thickness of the ribs to 30 cm (including thermal superinsulation, thermal shields, and vacuum enclosure). An additional, significant source of acceptance loss is the 30 cm wide radial gap that lets cables and services traverse the large chamber layers. Locating this gap at \(\eta\)=0 (90\({}^{0}\) polar angle) would create an acceptance hole (no muon detection) that is projective, but whose rapidity extension is minimized. As an alternative, the gap could be placed at larger z; this would restore the acceptance, but at the expense of degraded resolution over a more extended pseudorapidity range, due to partial chamber coverage (2 layers only), and to the presence of additional material.

More troublesome are the octants affected by the feet that carry the internal ATLAS subdetectors and the toroids. The rails limit the azimuthal coverage of the inner chamber layer, whereas the feet increase the effective thickness of the coil ribs and the corresponding acceptance loss.

A detailed calculation of the acceptance [13] has been performed by tracing geantinos (infinite-momentum trajectories) in a simulation package that embeds a detailed description of the spectrometer geometry. Each chamber is made of two multilayers, each consisting of three layers of drift tubes (3 cm diameter) separated by a spacer ranging in width from 7.5 cm (small inner chambers) to 33 cm (large outer chambers). A chamber is considered hit by a particle when both multilayers are crossed by the particle trajectory.

With this rather stringent criterion, and with the corridor for services and cables placed at \(\eta\)=0, the acceptance for traversing at least three chambers is about 80% in the barrel (\(\eta<1\)). The main contributions to the three-chamber acceptance loss are the cut-outs in the inner and middle chambers due to rails, feet, and BT coil ribs. In the latter case, the loss in single-muon acceptance amounts to about 6% of the barrel phase space. The 3-point acceptance in the barrel is illustrated in Fig. 14 as a two-dimensional map in \(\eta\times\phi\) space.

The acceptance for crossing at least two chambers is 96%. In the 4% of the cases where no momentum measurement is possible at all, 2% correspond to coverage by a single chamber (muon identification, but no measurement, may be possible in some cases, and at very low luminosity only); the remaining 2% represent a plain loss coming from the service gap at 90\({}^{0}\).

In the transition region, the three-point acceptance is mainly limited by the BT coil width. The loss can be almost completely compensated by lengthening the small inner chambers in the barrel (see Sec. 4.4), but this must remain compatible with the space required for services.

In the end-cap region, the thickness of the shielding needed to control the n/\(\gamma\) background leads to cut off the coverage at \(\eta\)=2.7. Apart from this limitation, the small acceptance losses come mostly from the rail system cutting into the first two chamber layers, and from the transition from a 16-fold azimuthal segmentation of the chambers to an 8-fold segmentation at \(\eta\)=1.4.

In all regions, the contribution of the alignment corridors to the acceptance loss has been kept well below the 1% level.

### Muon momentum resolution

In order to assess the performance of the toroid system better than could be done on the basis of field integrals alone, a software package has been developed that computes the expected momentum resolution as a function of the momentum P, pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\) and azimuthal angle \(\phi\) of a muon produced at the IP with these kinematic parameters.

This program incorporates, as realistically as possible, the baseline muon chamber layout as available at present [14], as described in Figs. 1 to 3 and 10 to 13. It also models in a detailed (albeit simplified) fashion, the distribution of radiative material in the spectrometer, by defining a finite number of "material" planes which can be either parallel or perpendicular to the beam axis (Appendix II).

As its first step, the package calculates, at the level of each chamber, the magnetic deflection experienced by a muon track, by numerically integrating the formula

\[\mbox{D}=0.3\;/\;\mbox{P}\quad\mbox{x}\quad\int_{0}^{\mbox{L}}\;(\mbox{L}\; \mbox{-}\;\ell)\;\mbox{B}\;\mbox{d}\ell\]

where P is the muon momentum (in GeV/c), B the component of the magnetic field (in Tesla) perpendicular to the deflection plane, \(\ell\) the curvilinear abscissa along the track, and L the curvilinear distance to the chamber considered. The program then takes into account multiple scattering by evaluating, for each of the material planes traversed, the deflection, at each of the chambers hit (as well as the full chamber-to-chamber correlations), due to a one standard deviation multiple scattering angle corresponding to the radiative thickness of the material plane in question. The achievable momentum resolution (before energy fluctuations) is then obtained by inverting a matrix formed with linear combinations of these "magnetic" and "multiple scattering" deflections and of their various cross-products. Finally, the contribution of muon energy loss fluctuations in the calorimeter (\(\sigma\sim 400\) MeV, assuming a track-by-track correction in the hadron calorimeter) is added in quadrature [15].

As an illustration of the performance of the spectrometer, Figs. 15 to 17 show the momentum resolution in a standard octant, for transverse momenta P\({}_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\) =100 GeV/c and P\({}_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\)=1 TeV/c. These values are representative of the first two resolution regimes discussed in Sec. 2.2, and which we briefly recall here:

* at high momentum (P\({}_{\mbox{\tiny T}}\) > 300 GeV/c), the resolution is dominated by the precision (related to the number of chambers crossed by the particle and the spatial resolution of these chambers) with which the magnetic deflection is measured, as compared to the actual magnitude of that deflection (which is related to the field integral along the particle trajectory).

at lower momenta (P\({}_{\rm T}\) < 300 GeV/c), the resolution is increasingly limited by multiple scattering. This contribution depends on the amount of material traversed (expressed in number of radiation lengths), and on the distribution of this material along the track (the worst case corresponding to an accumulation of material close to the middle of the measured track).

A priori, the minimum number of chambers required to measure the deflection is three. But as the chambers are made of two multilayers of tubes separated by a distance of the order of 30 cm, they provide a measurement of the direction of the track as well as of its position. Therefore, for large enough a magnetic deflection, two chambers along the track can be sufficient to measure its momentum (although with significantly less precision than provided by a three-chamber "sagitta" measurement). This is of importance because the presence of material from the magnet itself (coils, ribs, services) limits the three-chamber acceptance.

For 1 TeV/c transverse momentum, the mean momentum resolution is around 10% in the barrel and end-cap regions (Fig. 15). The spikes that one observes in the barrel region at \(\eta\)=0.4 and 0.8 correspond to a muon going through a coil rib (Fig. 16), thereby missing the middle chamber; only the two-chamber measurement then contributes. The large peak at 1.1 < \(\eta\) < 1.25 reflects the fact that the innermost small barrel chamber (BIS) does not extend sufficiently far along the beam direction, because of an apparent space conflict with services lines; this causes a gap in three-chamber coverage over part of the azimuth. This is one of the issues pending in the area of chamber layout. In the transition region (Fig. 15), the \(\phi\)-averaged resolution increases to \(\sim\) 17 % and 40 % at \(\eta\)\(\sim\) 1.3 and 1.6, respectively. In these areas, the Barrel and End-cap Toroids partially cancel each other's field, leading to a reduced integrated deflection over a limited azimuthal range. This effect lead to introducing a small additional chamber, visible in Fig. 16, in the gap between the Barrel and End-cap Toroid cryostats; without that chamber, no usable measurement could be performed around \(\eta\)\(\sim\) 1.6 in the \(\phi\) range concerned, even at lower momenta.

For 100 GeV/c transverse momentum, the mean momentum resolution is around 2% in the barrel region (Fig. 16) and around 3% in the end-cap (Fig. 17). On top of the spikes (which appear at the same rapidity as for the 1 TeV case, and correspond to the rib regions where particles cross only two chambers and to the BIS gap), many additional "bumps" are now visible. These correspond to \(\eta\) values where the resolution is dominated by multiple scattering in the voussoirs or struts of the Barrel Toroid. Between these "bumps", the resolution is of the order of 1.8%, whereas a simple extrapolation of the 1 TeV results would suggest about 1.0% (before including multiple scattering effects). The difference comes from the multiple scattering in the middle muon chamber. Similarly, the material of the ECT cryostat, as currently modeled, limits the average resolution to around 3.0% in the forward region.

## 5 Summary of pending issues

In conclusion, we summarize below the most important issues that remain pending, at the time of this writing, at the interface between the toroid magnet system and the rest of the Atlas detector. What follows in no way replaces the detailed discussion of the preceding sections; the intent is rather to highlight the most important points. The summary below will, by nature, evolve as the design progresses.

### 5.1 Interplay between BT warm structure and \(\mu\) spectrometer design

As discussed in detail in Sec. 3.2, any change, even minor, in the mechanical envelope of the Barrel Toroid can impact the muon detector layout, possibly its performance (acceptance), as well as the dimensions of MDT or RPC chambers, which need to be fixed within approximately the next half-year. Future detailed design studies of the warm structure may suggest modifications of the mechanical envelope of BT structural elements (vousoirs, struts, ribs, cryostats); this may be linked, for instance, to updated criteria on maximum allowable stress levels, or to a more complete understanding of how to support the magnet off the detector feet. Should this occur, it will be necessary to carefully weight, in the overall design choices, already existing constraints linked to the detector layout, and, if significant layout or dimensional adjustments are required, to the construction schedule of the muon detectors.

Of particular importance in this regard are:

* the choice of the shape (narrow beam with free gap or wide plate with man-hole), dimensions, and material of the vousoirs and struts (Secs 2.4, 3.2, 3.3, 3.6.2, and 3.7.2);
* a timely understanding of the procedures and tooling needed to install the muon chambers (Sec. 3.4).

### 5.2 Radiative transparency

While the voussoirs and other structures of the BT have already received considerable attention from the viewpoint of multiple scattering, a more faithful simulation of the impact of ECT material on the momentum resolution, remains to be carried out. The results may lead to some optimization of the ECT design from this viewpoint.

### 5.3 Single-muon acceptance

A number of topics are under study and will influence design details of the Barrel Toroid and of the muon chamber layout:

* the optimum location of the service gap (Sec. 4.2), currently located at z=0, but for which two other locations (tz\(\sim\) 3.5 m and tzl\(\sim\) 7 m) are being evaluated;
* more generally, the routing of services for the solenoid and electromagnetic calorimeter;
* the possibility to extend the small inner barrel chambers (BIS) further in z, in order to remove the gap in 3-point coverage (Sec. 4.4 and Fig. 17);the exact shape of the detector feet, and the muon chamber layout in that area;
* the structural design of the BT axial force transfer mechanism, which may impact that of the ECT, as well as the muon chamber layout in that area.

### 5.4 Alignment corridors

The geometry of the alignment corridors traversing BT structural elements, and the potential requirements associated with the alignment light paths traversing the ECT (magnet positioning tolerance, windows, etc.), need to be detailed to the engineering teams by the Muon Alignment Group.

Appendix I

**Preliminary requirements on muon chamber supports**

(compiled by R. von Boehn-Buchholz, 22 April 1996)

Chamber names follow the conventions

defined by the Muon layout Group, which can be obtained from J. Wotschack.

#### a.1.1 Barrel Toroid

* Fixation of support rail system for BML and BIL on the voussoirs along the chamber line.
* Fixation of support for BOS and BOL on the strut flange of the BT cryostat and along the chamber line.
* Fixation of support system for BMS on the struts (and possibly for the RPC's on the ribs) along the chamber line.
* Fixation of support rail system for BIS on the BT cryostat along the chamber line.

#### a.1.2 Transition region

* EME chambers: if their weight is supported off the BT, this will require a very rigid fastening piece between the chamber ring and the BT warm structure. If however their weight is supported by an external structure, then only the relative z-position of the chambers wrt the BT needs to be constrained, which can be achieved by a light fastening piece for guidance along the beam direction.

#### a.1.3 End-cap region

* BIE chambers : fixed to the ECT, in-between castellations, using an adjustable mount.
* EMC chambers: if their weight is supported off the ECT, this will require a very rigid fastening piece between the chamber ring and the ECT vacuum vessel. If however their weight is supported by an external movable structure, then only their relative z-position wrt the ECT needs to be constrained, which can be achieved by a light fastening piece for guidance along the beam direction.

## Appendix II Modeling assumptions used in resolution calculations

### Material distribution

The model used in calculating the momentum resolution is shown in Fig. 16. All magnet and muon detector elements are modeled by an equivalent radiative thickness of Aluminum, the mechanical dimensions of which are meant to reflect those in the actual design.

The assumptions on material distribution in the muon spectrometer are summarized in Table 4 below. The detailed shapes assumed for Barrel Toroid structural components are sketched in Fig. 18.

### Muon chamber resolution

The effective resolution assumed for a three-plane multilayer is 65 microns, obtained by conservatively combining the following contributions:

* single wire resolution: 85 \(\mu\)m
* autocalibration: 30 \(\mu\)m
* tube placement wrt to fiducials: 20 \(\mu\)m

(=> multilayer resolution bef. alignment = 56 \(\mu\)m)
* multilayer alignment 30 \(\mu\)m

## Figure captions

* Muon chamber layout: r-z view in the plane of an ECT coil, i.e. in the symmetry plane of the large barrel chambers.
* Muon chamber layout: r-z view in the plane of a BT coil, i.e. in the symmetry plane of the small barrel chambers.
* Muon chamber layout: r-\(\phi\) view, in the plane perpendicular to the beam axis.
* r-\(\phi\) view of the muon chamber layout near the feet.
* r-z view, in the plane of a Barrel coil (small chambers) for one of the two bottom BT coils.
* Geometry of the toroid windings. Half a Barrel coil, and one full ECT coil, are shown. The ECT coil is shown rotated in azimuth by 22.5 degrees, into the plane of the Barrel coil. The symbols describe the geometry used by the field calculation program and are defined in Tables II and III.
* Radial dependence of the azimuthal component of the magnetic field, in a plane perpendicular to the toroid axis. The horizontal axis is the radius (cylindrical coordinates). The vertical axis is the magnetic field (T); the sign convention is arbitrary. The solid and dotted curves include only the Biot-Savart contribution (no magnetic materials); they correspond to the azimuthal orientation of the Barrel and End-cap coil planes. The dotted curve and the small amplitude solid curve indicate the approximate magnitude of the contribution of the iron. (a) at z=0, i.e. in a plane passing through the interaction point. The solid curve corresponds to the azimuthal orientation of an ECT coil plane, i.e. half-way between two Barrel coils; the dashed curve corresponds to the orientation of a BT coil. (b) in a plane located at z=10 m from the IP. The dashed curve corresponds to the azimuthal orientation of an ECT coil; the solid curve corresponds to the orientation of a BT coil.
* Field integrals vs. pseudorapidity \(\eta\). The azimuthal field component is integrated along infinite momentum (straight line) trajectories, from the minimum to the maximum conductor radius (or z-coordinate, as appropriate) listed in Tables II and III. Each curve corresponds to a different initial azimuthal angle, ranging from that of the Barrel coil plane to that of the End-cap coil plane. The effect of the solenoid field, and of magnetic materials, is neglected in this figure. In addition, because the simplified geometry (cylindrical integration boundaries) does not strictly reflect the details of the muon chamber layout, these curves should be considered as the "available" bending power only.
* Schematic representation of the magnetic probe layout and of the coil deformation model, used to reconstruct the magnetic field inside a chamber octant, in the barrel region.
* Forward chamber layout: EI layer (upstream of ECT).
