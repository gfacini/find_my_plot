**Abstract**

The temperature dependance of the response of the ATLAS electromagnetic liquid argon calorimeter has been measured to be 2 % per degree Kelvinas expected, coming mainly from drift velocity variation with temperature. This dependance will have to be monitored in the ATLAS calorimeter and possibly corrected. A preliminary study of the drift time measurement has been performed : the results are not yet at the level needed, and further tests have to be carried out in order to see how such a method could be used in ATLAS to monitor temperature variation as well as gap non uniformity. The goal would be a 300 ps accuracy on the drift time.

Introduction

The goal of the electromagnetic calorimeter of ATLAS is to reach a global constant term smaller than 0.7 %[1]. Possible long range effects could come from non uniformity of liquid argon temperature. A temperature scan has been performed in June 1995 with the '2-meter' RD3 prototype [2]. The results of this analysis will be presented in the first part. One way to correct for such an effect and also for gap non uniformity could be to measure the drift time (t\({}_{D}\)) of each cell of the calorimeter. This method will be discussed in a second part as well as results of a preliminary study done with pulse shapes taken in a stand-alone mode with the RD3 prototype.

## 2 Temperature signal dependance

A temperature scan over about a 10 degrees \({}^{\circ}\)K was performed with the RD3 prototype with a 200 GeV electron beam in region equipped with Si charge preamplifiers. The temperature was estimated indirectly from pressure measurements in the gaz above the liquid both at the front and back faces of the calorimeter.

### pedestal and calibration

Before any reconstruction of the electron signal, the pedestal and calibration have been investigated. Figure 1 shows the pedestal and gain variation with respect to the standard operating point (89.8\({}^{\circ}\)K). As expected no particular effect is observed and all the points are within a few per mille 1.

Figure 1: _Variation of pedestal and gain with respect to operating point as a function of temperature_

Figure 2 presents the electronic noise variation (r.m.s. of pedestal) as a function of temperature for Si Jfets. The slope is \(-1.5\%\) which is in good agreement with test bench measurements (\(-1.42\%\)) [3]. As expected, no variation was observed in the 0T and GaAs electronics [4].

### Electron signal

The total energy has been reconstructed in a \(3\times 3\) cluster by summing the three samplings in depth without any weight. As during most of the temperature scan a channel in the middle nonet was dead, it was never used in the analysis for signal reconstruction but its impact on energy resolution will be shown. In order not to include other effects, only electrons impinging within \(\pm 10\%\) in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) (in cell units with respect to the cell center) were kept, so that corrections for lateral leakage in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) modulation response were not needed. The mean value and the resolution were extracted from a gaussian fit. The energy in each sampling was also computed for events with a total energy within \(\pm 5\sigma\) of the mean value.

In figure 3 are displayed the energy ratios normalized to the operating point (\(89.8^{\circ}\)K), separately for the total energy, the energy in first sampling (front) and the sum of the energy of the remaining two samplings (middle + back). A few comments can be made about this result :

* A clear dependance is observed. The result of a second order polynomial fit gives a first derivative at \(89.8^{\circ}\)K of 2 %. This number results from the sum of 2 contributions : \[\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{\Delta\rho}{\rho}+\frac{\Delta V_{D}}{V_{D}}\] where \(\rho\) is the argon density and \(V_{D}\) the drift velocity. Argon density variation is a well known quantity and is also plotted in figure 3. Subtracting it, the drift velocity is estimated to vary about 1.55 % per degree at \(89.8^{\circ}\)K.

Figure 2: _Si Jfet noise as a function of temperature_

* The signal variation seems different between the samplings. Figure 4 shows the fraction of energy in each sampling. The front and back sampling have a different sign slope compared to the middle sampling. This can be explained by an insufficient waiting period between temperature changes which has not allowed the middle to reach its equilibrium.

The energy resolution has also be been studied and is displayed in figure 5. No systematic effect with temperature is observed. The energy resolution can be slightly improved by about 5 % by weighting the samplings. On the other hand, as there is a front/back effect as shown previously, the weights depend on temperature : indeed using the weights of 89.8\({}^{\circ}\)K at 97\({}^{\circ}\)K deteriorates the energy resolution by 4.6 %. Finally as already mentioned one middle cell was not used in the reconstruction. Including its energy allows a gain of 2.5 % on energy resolution. (It should be noticed that this effect is small because the analysis is limited to events which are at the center of the cluster).

## 3 Drift time measurement

### Purpose of this measurement

An accurate measurement of the drift time, defined as \(t_{D}=g/V_{D}\) where \(V_{D}\) is the drift velocity of the electrons in the argon and g the gap, could bring information on drift velocity non uniformity (mainly coming from temperature variation in space and time) and about gap non uniformity. This would allow to control or reduce these two contributions to the global constant term of the calorimeter. The first effect is expected to be rather smooth and long range and the second more localized (varying gaps at transition between modules or supermodules).

Figure 5: _Energy resolution versus temperature_

#### 3.1.1 Temperature non uniformity

As the response variation is 2 % per degree but only 1.5 % comes from drift velocity, a 0.1 % control of the effect of temperature on signal requires an accuracy of 0.075 % on the drift time. This means 300 ps for typical calorimeter pulses (\(t_{D}\simeq 400\) ns), which is quite challenging.

#### 3.1.2 Gap non uniformity

The initial current in the calorimeter is :

\[I=\frac{Q}{g}.V_{D}\]

where Q is the charge deposited in the gap of width g, and \(V_{D}\) the drift velocity. The charge is proportionnal to the MIP sampling fraction \(\eta_{S}\) defined by :

\[\eta_{S}=\frac{g(dE/dx)_{Ar}}{g(dE/dx)_{Ar}+x_{Pb}(dE/dx)_{Pb}}\]

where \(x_{Pb}\) is the lead thickness and \((dE/dx)\) the energy loss. In the ATLAS EM calorimeter \(\eta_{S}\) is around 0.2.

Defining \(\alpha=\frac{\Delta g}{g}\) the relative variation of gap (the lead thickness is kept constant, only G10 can vary), the signal variation is :

\[\frac{\Delta I}{I}=\frac{\Delta\eta_{S}}{\eta_{S}}-\frac{\Delta g}{g}+\frac{ \Delta V_{D}}{V_{D}}\]

A simple calculation shows that the first term is \(\alpha(1-\eta_{S})\) and the last term, assuming that the drift velocity varies as the electric field to the power 1/3, is \(-\alpha/3\). Summing these 3 terms gives a signal sensitivity of -0.53 \(\alpha\) to the gap variation2.

Footnote 2: This result takes account only of the effect on the initial current. Including the effect of shaping will lower the value by about 0.1 %

The drift time dependance with the gap is given by :

\[\frac{\Delta t_{D}}{t_{D}}=-\frac{\Delta V_{D}}{V_{D}}+\frac{\Delta g}{g}=+1.3\alpha\]

Thus the drift time is about 3 times more sensitive to gap variation than the signal. This means that ATLAS requirement of 1 % for gap uniformity, which results in 0.5 % in signal uniformity, needs an accuracy of 1.3 % on drift time measurement (5.2 ns for a typical pulse shape). For instance, the 2 % signal drop observed in the RD3 prototype at the boundary between modules should result in a 25 ns longer drift time.

### Method : application to simulated signals

The drift time measurement would be performed by sampling the full pulse length, typi cally 20-25 bunch crossings, in dedicated runs at LHC and fitting the shape. The amplitude has to be large enough so that the noise can be reduced to a negligible level. Moreover, in absence of systematic effects, the error can be improved by using a large number of signals. In order to test the method, signals have been simulated adding the electronics noise (including its autocorrelation). Systematic effects induced by jitter on bunch crossing clock or by cross talk have been studied.

#### 3.2.1 Signal

The signal is the inverse Laplace transform of the overall chain response to a triangular current [5] :

\[V(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}[I_{\Delta}(s)\times\mathcal{H}_{pa}(s)\times\mathcal{H}_{ sh}(s)]\]

where

* \(I_{\Delta}(s)=I_{0}\left(\frac{1}{s}-\frac{1-e^{-\pi_{D}}}{s^{2}t_{D}}\right)\), \(I_{0}\) being the initial current.
* The transfer function of the current preamplifier is \(\mathcal{H}_{pa}(s)=\frac{\pm R_{f}}{(1+s\tau_{pa})}\), \(R_{f}\) is the feedback resistance and \(\tau_{pa}\) the preamplifier risetime.
* The transfer function of the ATLAS CR-RC2 shaper is \(\mathcal{H}_{sh}=\frac{\tau s}{(1+\tau s)^{3}}\), in which \(\tau\) is the shaper time constant.

This inverse Laplace transform gives :

\[V_{\Delta}(\boldsymbol{x})=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}R_{f}I_{0}[h_{1}(x)- \frac{1}{\pi_{D}}h_{2}(\boldsymbol{x})]&\text{if }\boldsymbol{x}\leq\boldsymbol{x}_{D}\\ R_{f}I_{0}[h_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})-\frac{1}{\pi_{D}}(h_{2}(\boldsymbol{x})-h_{ 2}(\boldsymbol{x}-\boldsymbol{x}_{D}))]&\text{if }\boldsymbol{x}\geq \boldsymbol{x}_{D}\end{array}\right.\]

where \(\boldsymbol{x}=t/\tau\), \(\boldsymbol{x}_{D}=t_{D}/\tau\), \(\lambda=\tau_{pa}/\tau\),

\[h_{1}(\boldsymbol{x})=\frac{\lambda^{2}e^{-\boldsymbol{x}/\lambda}}{(\lambda- 1)^{3}}-\left[\frac{\boldsymbol{x}^{2}}{2}+\frac{\lambda\boldsymbol{x}}{ \lambda-1}+\frac{\lambda^{2}}{(\lambda-1)^{2}}\right]\frac{e^{-\boldsymbol{x }}}{\lambda-1}\]

\[h_{2}(\boldsymbol{x})=1-\frac{\lambda^{3}e^{-\boldsymbol{x}/\lambda}}{( \lambda-1)^{3}}+\left[\frac{\boldsymbol{x}^{2}}{2}+\frac{2\lambda-1}{\lambda- 1}\boldsymbol{x}+\frac{3\lambda^{2}-3\lambda+1}{(\lambda-1)^{2}}\right]\frac{ e^{-\boldsymbol{x}}}{\lambda-1}\]

As an example a typical pulse shape sampled every 25 ns is shown on figure 6.

In some case shown later, the preamplifier decay time can not be neglected and the preamplifier transfer function needs an additional \(\frac{\tau_{f}}{(1+s\tau_{f})}\) term. The resulting temporal waveform is not provided in this note because it is much more complicated than the previous one4. This results in the appearance of a non flat understood and a positive overshoot, as will be shown in experimental measurements with Si Jfet.

Footnote 4: Neverthless, an analytical expression exists and can be provided if needed.

#### 3.2.2 Electronic noise

The electronic noise has been simulated, in the same way as described in reference [6], by adding every nanosecond the response of the electronic chain to a \(\delta^{{}^{\prime}}\) over a 10 \(\mu\)s range. The r.m.s. was adjusted to the expected noise contribution at a given energy (0.1 % of the amplitude for a 40 GeV signal in a cell). For each signal a point is chosen randomly over the 10 \(\mu\)s array and every 25 ns the noise value is added to the signal.

#### 3.2.3 Results

The following procedure has been applied. A few thousand signals have been simulated with noise (0.1 %). For each signal the pulse shape was fitted using the Minuit package and the parameters extracted. These parameters are :

* \(\tau\) the shaper internal time constant (15.8 ns).

* \(t_{0}\) the delay of the pulse with respect to a pulse starting at t=0 ns (-144 ns).
* \(\tau_{\text{pa}}\) is the the preamplifier risetime (17.38).
* \(\mathcal{N}\) the amplitude normalization.
* \(t_{D}\) the drift time (420 ns).

Figure 7 shows the evolution of these parameters (except \(t_{D}\)) as a function of the size of the region used to fit, which starts two samples before the beginning of the pulse. The fitting procedure has not been optimized so that only 70 % of fits converged correctly and their results plotted. These results show that even when only a few bunch crossings of the undershoot are used, the results of the fits are stable but a small systematic shift on \(\tau\) and \(\tau_{pa}\) is observed. This systematic effect disappears when a 10 ns interval is used as more points can be used in the positive region of the pulse, which is the most sensitive to the \(\tau\) and \(\tau_{pa}\) parameters.

Figure 8 shows the drift time and its r.m.s. as a function of the size of the region used in the fits. No shift appears on \(t_{D}\), contrary to the other parameters, and the result does not depend on the number of points taken in the fit. It is surprising that even in absence of the region where the signal returns to zero, the drift time can be measured, but in fact the amplitude of the undershoot brings enough information because it is strongly correlated to the drift time as displayed in figure 9. This result is very important because the signal return to zero cannot be used for real calorimeter pulses (see section 3.5.3). It should be noted that the r.m.s. is improved when points are added. Not using the region

Figure 6: _Typical pulse shape response of the ATLAS calorimeter. The black circles represent measurement every bunch crossing_

where the signal returns to zero increases the r.m.s by a factor 2. Finally this r.m.s. scales as the noise as shown in figure 10

Figure 8: _Evolution of drift time and its r.m.s. as a function of the region used to fit_

Figure 9: _Amplitude undershoot as a function of drift time, the others parameters being kept constant_

The effect of jitter on the bunch crossing clock has been investigated. This has been produced by a smearing of the bunch crossing interval (25 ns) with a 200 ps gaussian. This does not result in a systematic shift but only increases the r.m.s. (see table 1). Some correlations also appear between parameters, for instance \(t_{D}\) as a function of \(\tau\) in figure 11. This effect can be understood as a change of the time scale. Indeed first \(\tau\) is very sensitive to the positive lobe of the pulse (4 or 5 bunch crossings), where the time interval can fluctuate by 1 %. In the fits this interval is always kept fixed (25 ns), and the time interval fluctuations result in a variation of \(\tau\) from one event to another. Since the drift time is measured by the relative amplitude of the undershoot, it is correlated to the integral of the positive lobe of the pulse and consequently to \(\tau\).

A potential deformation of the signal giving a systematic effect could come from cross-talk signals. The cross-talk has been calculated and simulated using results from reference [7] and is shown in figure 12. The cross talk has been normalized so that it

Figure 10: Drift time distribution for (1) 0.1% noise (2), 1% noise, (3) 0.1 % noise + smearing 200 ps, (4) 0.1% noise + 4 % cross talk

measures 4 % of the amplitude of the signal at the signal maximum. The deformation of the shape induces an important change on \(\tau\) and \(\mathcal{N}\) (4.5 %) and also a systematic shift on \(t_{D}\) (600 ps). The parameter distributions (\(\tau\), \(\tau_{pa}\) and N) show also some tails. Reducing the cross talk to 2 %, which is the level anticipated in the middle section of the ATLAS calorimeter, would decrease the shift to 200 ps.

Figure 11: _Correlation between \(t_{D}\) and \(\tau\) when smearing on bunch crossing is included_

Figure 12: _Cross-talk waveform as a function of time. Black circles are measurements every bunch crossing._

To summarize, the requirements for a 300 ps accuracy drift time measurements are :

* The cross talk should not exceed 2-2.5 % in order not to be dominated by the systematic error.
* Jitter can be tolerated but it increases the number of signals needed (for 0.1 % noise and 200 ps jitter about 40 signals are necessary).
* As the accuracy depends on the noise level (energy in the cell) and the number of accumulated pulses, N, the 300 ps requirement can be characterized by a single number which is 40 GeV. \(\sqrt{N}\) if only noise is considered.

### Study of pulse shapes on a test bench

In order to test how well the electronics chain is understood, the response to various signals has been investigated on a test bench, with the same system used at CERN (see section 3.5.1).

#### 3.3.1 Response of the 0T to a step

The response of the 0T to a step input has been studied with a 32 ns lemo cable and a 390 pF capacitor representing the detector. This is presented in figure 135.

Figure 13: _0T response to a step with a 390 pF capacity detector. The black circles are data and the histogram is the result of a fit._

The bump at 120 ns is due to a high frequency reflection [8] and is not taken into account in the fit, which reproduces correctly the data. In absence of capacitor but with a 0.5 ns lemo cable the value of the shaper internal time constant \(\tau\) is found to 11.05 ns in good agreement with the expected value deduced from peaking time measurement.

Figure 14: _Response to a triangular input (top). Zoom of the undershoot (bottom left) and the signal return to zero (bottom right). The circles are the data and the histogram is the result of a fit._

#### 3.3.2 Response of the 0T to a triangular signal

More interesting is the response to a triangular input signal which is the best approximation of the electron signal in the calorimeter. The response has been measured on a test bench and is shown in figure 14 as well as the fitted curve. The fit has been performed allowing a possible decay time \(\tau_{f}\) due to AC coupling, as described in section 3.2.1, which is well justified by the non flat undershoot. It should always be remembered for the reasons explained before that the region 200-300 ns has to be excluded from the fit. The end of the undershoot shows a small deformation with respect to the ideal signal.

The fits of the response to a triangular input have been performed also without \(\tau_{f}\) parameter (assuming a flat undershoot) and over a restricted area (0-500) ns, that is to say without including the signal return to zero. On one hand the full pulse over 1\(\mu\)s gives two drift time results in good agreement whatever \(\tau_{f}\) is used (401.92 and 401.26 ns). On the other hand when the fit is restricted to the (0-500) ns interval, the only sensitivity to \(t_{D}\) is given by the undershoot amplitude (see figure 9). Not taking into account the slope (1 % over 200 ns) gives then a shorter drift time by 12 ns! Dealing with such a slope will be one of the major difficulties of the drift time measurement.

These various tests have demonstrated that the electronics chain is rather well understood and should not be a major limitation.

### Drift velocity measurement

Because a change of argon temperature needs too much time, the data for drift time measurements were taken at different high voltage values in order to study the sensitivity of the result. This requires a knowledge of the drift velocity variation with high voltage. Figure 15 shows the results of an analysis on high voltage scan taken in July 93 with the RD3 prototype in the 0T region. Not only does the drift velocity contribute to the signal variation but recombination and attachment with impurity do as well. Two models have been used to estimate the recombination [9] :

* For the Jaffe model based on columnar recombination theory [10], the fraction of electrons not recombined as a function of high voltage can be written : \[F=\frac{1}{1+k^{{}^{\prime}}/E_{0}}\] where \(k^{{}^{\prime}}\) has been measured experimentally to (0.53 \(\pm\) 0.04) kV/cm and \(E_{0}\) is the electric field. For 2000 V and a gap of 1.8 mm this fraction is 95.48 %.
* The Imel and Thomas model [11], based on box recombination, gives : \[F=\frac{1}{\xi}ln(1+\xi)\ \ \ \ \ \xi=C/E_{0}\] The C paramater has been determined to be (0.80 \(\pm\) 0.02) kV/cm for \(\beta\) particles. The fraction is equal to 95.56 % at 2000 V.

As the impurity level has not been measured in the test beam period, the drift time variation was obtained by unfolding the effect of recombination, that is to say assuming no pollution effect. This gives :

* \(-0.457+0.285V^{0.215}\) for the first model.
* \(-0.475+0.274V^{0.222}\) for the second model.

These expressions do not reproduce well the behaviour at very low voltages. Forcing the fit to gives no signal in absence of high voltage would increase the exponent to 0.35. In the following, the parametrization with the Imel-Thomas has been chosen to compute the expected drift time variations with high voltage, as recent measurements seem in good agreement with this model [12].

### Study of electron pulseshape from the calorimeter

#### 3.5.1 Description of test setup

The data analyzed were taken with a stand-alone acquisition using a Lecroy oscilloscope and a PC computer giving a sampling interval of either 10 or 2.5 ns. The signal was triggered with a \(S3\times S4\) signal6 and an average of 1000 waveforms was performed inside the oscilloscope and recorded in the PC. It turned out that an important fraction of the recorded signals deposited little energy (muons, pions..), so that the resulting average has a small amplitude and is sensitive to fluctuations in the burst content and the position in the cell. For this reason, the amplitude measurement could not be used to estimate the signal variation with high voltage in this analysis. Moreover, the oscilloscope uses an 8 bits ADC with a very poor differential linearity which may explain some of the problems encountered and described in the following.

Footnote 6: S3 and S4 are two scintillation counters on the beam line in front of cryostat

Figure 15: _Response to 200 GeV electron as a function of high voltage. Dashed line is a fit to data with Imel-Thomas recombination unfolded_

#### 3.5.2 Si Jfet results

Pulses were recorded at 2 different high voltages in the region equipped with Si Jfet preamplifiers. A typical pulse is displayed in figure 16 with a 10 ns sampling interval. Attempts were done to fit the pulse shape including a \(\tau_{f}\) decay time7. The fit has a lot of difficulty to converge and the results are not very easy to interpret so that the work on it has not been pursued. Nevertheless it should be noted that until 500 ns the shape is rather well reproduced.

Footnote 7: \(\tau_{f}=R_{f}C_{f}\) with \(R_{f}=10\)k\(\Omega\) and \(C_{f}=33pF\). This small value of \(\tau_{f}\) helps in handling the large dynamic range by not integrating all the incoming charge

#### 3.5.3 0T results

Signals have also been recorded in the 0T region with a 10 ns sampling at 1400, 1600, 1800 and 2000 V. These signals and the superimposed fit results are shown in figure 17. The offset (due to the oscilloscope) and the noise level were estimated from the baseline before the pulse (between 0 and 110 ns) and the sample with maximum amplitude normalized to one. The noise measurement was used as error in the fit. The bump of the 0T signal has not been included in the fit (between 230 and 400 ns).

Firstly, it can be observed that the undershoot has a very gradual return to zero, which is not well reproduced by the fit. As shown by the study of the response to

Figure 16: _Response to 200 GeV electron with Si Jfet (black points) Histogram line is the result of the fit_a triangular input, this is not due to the electronics but it is probably linked to the mechanical design of the accordion calorimeter where the electric field and the gap can have locally a strong variation. Such an effect has already been observed with MonteCarlo simulation which includes charge collection [13], but needs to be confirmed.

Moreover the undershoot is not flat and presents a negative slope (\(\cdot 4.10^{-5}/\mathrm{ns}\)) which can not be explained either by \(\tau_{f}\) or pollution which would give a positive slope8. Yet, no satisfactory explanation has been found for this and the analysis has to deal with it, giving probably a bias on the absolute value of the drift time. Contrary to the results of MonteCarlo study previously presented, the drift time measurement with the calorimeter will depend on the region taken for the fit (because of the varying mean value

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

The results are summarized the following table :

The results the two methods are significantly different but the goal is not an absolute measurement of the drift time but only its variation. This study is preliminary and a better and more robust estimate has to be found in the future to reach the desired precision of 300 ps. In the second method, the statistical error given by the fit is around 1 ns. In the first method it is difficult to estimate but it should be of the same order. In order to estimate correctly this error one would need to have recorded many signals at a given high voltage and to look at the r.m.s. dispersion of the \(t_{D}\) estimation. Figure 20 presents the variation of the drift time as a function of high voltage with the two methods as well as the expected value computed from the drift velocity formula obtained in the Imel-Thomas model, showing a correct agreement

#### 3.5.4 GaAs results

These signals have been taken during a different period with 50 GeV electrons and probably not in the most energetic cell so that the averaged signal was very small (with large fluctuations in amplitude), only a few mV. Data were recorded at seven high voltage settings, from 1900 V to 1600 V. At each high voltage setting, at least three different signals were recorded (This number was limited by the beam time allocated to this measurement). As an example a 1900 (V) signal and a 1600 (V) signal are superimposed in figure 21 showing clearly the drift time difference. The fit was performed using the first method described with 0T and the results are summarized in table 2. The error has been computed as r.m. s./\(\sqrt{N-1}\) where N is the number of measurements.

A typical signal and its fit are displayed in figure 22. It should be noted that a relatively high value of drift is obtained (480 ns when 410 ns would be expected by extrapolating the 0T result), which can be observed by the longer undershoot given by the fit. A gap variation for this cell or a fit without including \(\tau_{f}\), which may be smaller in GaAs than in 0T, might explain part of this discrepancy. However this has not been demonstrated.

Figure 21: _Normalized signal as a function of time : Full line at 1900 V and dashed line at 1600 V_Figure 23 shows the measurement of drift time as a function of high voltage (summarized in table 3) and the expected values assuming no pollution. The general behaviour is again in relatively good agreement with the expectation but some points seem to disagree. For each point the average accuracy is about 1.6 ns.

Table 3: Results of drift time in GaAs as a function of high voltage

Figure 23: _Drift variation as a function of high voltage. The dashed line is the expectation_voltage for some points. Nevertheless due to lack of more detailed informations (each waveform and not the average for example), it is not possible to demonstrate this with these data. If we ignore the drift time variation, we can evaluate what would be the ultimate accuracy by correcting the observed correlation. The numbers can be found in table 3 resulting in a 1.2 ns accuracy.

### Prospects

The results obtained in the 0T or the GaAs region have demonstrated that by using a fit of the pulse shape, the variations of the pulse can be followed over a large high voltage range. The accuracy reached is slighly greater than 1 ns but some effects (negative slope, correlation with amplitude..) are not yet understood. However, they are probably inherent to the setup so that this number could be reduced in the future. To investigate these problems, the next measurement with this setup9would have to be done in a sequential mode, that is to say not recording the average signal but all the pulses. It would also be better to use a narrow high energetic beam impinging in the center of the cell studied.

For the short term, data were also taken with the Fermi system in the 0T region at different high voltage settings and are under analysis [14]. A good calibration of the system would be needed to do a drift time measurement but for the moment variations of the waveform as a function of the impact point and energy can be explored. Data taken with the L1 trigger system [15] may also be used to investigate the problems encountered but with the disavantage of working with the signal of a trigger tower.

For the long term in ATLAS, a new measurement is needed with a pipeline or the Fermi system to assess the results which can be derived from the oscilloscope measurement, especially in the GaAs region. It should be also shown that the measurement of the drift time of the cells at the boundary between two modules can be used to correct the energy and recover the energy resolution.

## 4 Conclusion

Measurements with the RD3 prototype have shown that the temperature dependance of the signal of the electromagnetic calorimeter is 2 % per \({}^{\circ}\)K. A method to monitor and possibly correct for non uniformity of temperature and gap has been proposed : it consists of extracting the drift time of each cell. The desired precision is dictated by the temperature dependance of the signal : a 0.1 % control of of the signal requires a 300 ps accuracy. Montecarlo simulation shows that by using a small number of pulses ( \(<\) 100 per cell) one could reach better than 1 ns accuracy. First tests have been done on a test bench and with electrons demonstrating that a 1 ns precision seems possible. This should be confirmed in the next runs.
