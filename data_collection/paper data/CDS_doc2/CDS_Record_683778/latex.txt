## 1 Introduction

The two ATLAS Barrel TRT prototype modules built in 1997 at Duke University and Indiana University were tested in the CERN H8 beam line in September, 1997. The purpose of the tests was to evaluate the module design and check the performance with the high density, high speed ASDBLR electronics designed by University of Pennsylvania. We were interested in operating the chambers in a testbeam environment with front-end electronics that is close to the packing density that we will require in the ATLAS detector and to evaluate noise and possible pickup. We were also able to study the tracking resolution of the combined system of two modules in a magnetic field of 1.56 T. By using 20 GeV electron and pion beams we were also able to study the transition radiation in the combined module array as a function of the radiator material, the angle of track incidence, and the position of the track in the module.

## 2 Experimental setup

### Module Description

In the summer of 1997 two modules were constructed with a cross sectional size that is appropriate for the inner layer of modules in the TRT Barrel. These are known as type 1 modules. One of the modules was built at Duke University and one at Indiana University. The lengths of the modules were 1.3 m instead of the design specification of 1.5 m. They were made shorter so that they could fit inside the superconducting dipole magnet in the H8 beam line. The modules contained 329 straw tubes with a diameter of 4 mm. These were held in a precise pattern by the end plates and by four Kapton/foam support sheets evenly spaced along the length of the module. Each support sheet was aligned in an accurate jig during construction and was bonded to the shell at several points on each of the four sides for strength after alignment. This is shown in Figure 2-1.

The straws were strung with 30 micron gold-plated tungsten wire which had an electrical break 75 cm from one end. This is similar to the wire proposed for the outer straws of the production modules except that, being full size modules, the break in those modules would come in the middle. The wire break in the 1.30 m modules came near a point where one of the support sheets was placed and where also a twister wire support kept the wire positioned at the center of the straw. The wire break, made of a short section of glass capillary tube, was fused to two lengths of wire to make the wire assembly that was drawn into each straw tube and tensioned to 60 g. These modules were the first large scale test of this technique.

Two types of radiator were stacked into the module. One type (Veledon), which has a density of 1.3 gm/cm\({}^{3}\) was identical to what had been used in the 50 cm module tested in 1996 and the other (LPR), with a density of 0.8 gm/cm\({}^{3}\), was a promising type which was available in thicker sheets and is less dense than Veladon. Most of the radiator was of the first kind but a section near the middle of

the module was packed with the LPR. The radiator comes in sheets and must have holes made in it for the straws to pass through.

### Running conditions

The modules were attached to a gas system that flowed a gas mixture through each module in parallel. The gas mixture was 70% Xenon, 20% CF4, 10% CO2. The modules were also ventilated by C02 in the region just outside the straws. This ventilation gas flowed into one end the shell through the radiator material and out other end. This gas insures that the region outside the straws is kept free of Xenon in the event of a small leak.

The high voltage for both modules was supplied by a single CAEN N126 CAMAC power supply. This supply was located in the counting house and was regulated for constant gain, with a small straw chamber that used the same ionization gas mixture that was supplied to the two modules. The baseline voltage applied to the straws was -1530 V. for a gain of approximately 2.5 x 104.

### Modules and beam line

The two modules were mounted in a holder which kept each of them fixed and aligned with the side of shortest length facing and perpendicular to the beam. With this orientation beam particles pass through the modules in the same way as high energy particles in the ATLAS detector. The holder had attachment points to fix it to its base frame.This is shown in Figure 2-1.

The base frame was made with rails so that the module could slide perpendicular to the beam and at the same time rotate around the vertical axis so that the beam would enter at an angle, corresponding to the polar angle in the ATLAS detector. This allowed us to take data at several angles of incidence. The base frame could also be reconfigured to run the rails vertically so that the module could be operated with its axis vertical. This enabled us to slide the modules into the dipole magnet with the field along the axis of the module. This orientation of the field corresponds to the one in the AT

LAS detector. Tests of the tracking resolution in the magnetic field were done with the module in this orientation.

The apparatus was set up in the H8 beamline in the North Area of the CERN SPS. This beam provides up to 200 GeV/c negative particles from a primary production target in the normal mode of operation. It can also be operated as a tertiary beam for pions or for electrons when the high energy photons from the production target produce electrons in a lead sheet placed in the beam line. The beam in this mode of operation has an energy of 20 GeV/c.

The beam line instrumentation was very similar to that of previous beam tests of other TRT prototypes in 1995 and 1996. It is shown in Figure 2-2. Four beam-defining scintillation counters provided the basis for triggering the apparatus on beam particles. Three of these (S1,2,3) were upstream of the prototype modules and one (M) was downstream. In addition, there was a gas filled beam cerenkov counter (not shown in the figure) in the beam line upstream of the counters, as well as a pre-shower counter (PS) and a lead glass shower counter downstream of the position where the prototype modules were positioned. These counters enabled us to distinguish between pions and electrons. There was also a scintillation counter with a hole in it for the beam to pass through. This was used in veto with the trigger.

The preshower counter was a scintillation counter with a thin sheet of lead on the upstream side. The lead glass detector was a group of five 40 cm long lead glass blocks viewed from the end with photomultiplier tubes. The contamination of pions in the set of particles identified as electrons was \(<\)1%.

The trajectories of the beam particles were measured both with two beam chambers and with three silicon strip detectors. The spatial precision of the trajectories at the position of the prototype modules was about 10 microns..

### Electronics

The front end electronics used in this test was very nearly the same as planned for the final detector. The heart of this system is the ASDBLR which includes eight channels of amplification, shaping, base line restoration and discrimination in a single chip. The output is a tri-level or ternary output designed to indicate the presence of a low level or a high level input signal. The discriminators associated with the high and low levels are set to different thresholds and the output is either zero, output level one or output level two. The reason for a ternary output is that the transition radiation gives larger pulses than minimum ionizing pulses, and thus, by setting the thresholds correctly, one can effectively distinguish the minimum ionizing hits from transition radiation hits. The outputs are differential current drive outputs to minimize coupling to the inputs.

In our application two of these chips were bonded to opposite sides of a small circuit board (called the stamp board) provided with pins to connect to the signal sources. The signals from the wires were routed on the outer module face plate (called the tension plate) to pin sockets arranged in patterns to match the patterns of the pins on the stamp boards.

Not all of the wires were instrumented. Due to limited time and resources only the wires in a narrow band along the trajectories of the beam particles were read out. Forty wires were read out in each module divided up so that five stamp boards handled eight wires a piece. The pattern of instrumented wires is shown in Figure 2-2.

The signals from the ASDBLR chips were connected to high density double row connectors mounted on each stamp board. A small adapter card was designed which terminated the eight unused out

puts on each stamp board and fed the signals from the special high density connector to a connector which mates with standard flat cable.

Flat cables carried the differential current drive ternary signals to translator boards (designed for use only in the beamtest) where they were converted to separate standard ECL signals for both the low level and the high level. The ECL signals then went to the inputs of commercial TDC units (Lecroy 4291). There were a total of 160 (5\(\times\)32) channels readout.

The translator boards were located about 2 m from the modules. The power for the ASDBLR chips was fed along the flat cable from the translator boards where the correct voltages were generated. The threshold levels were also fed along the same flat cable.

The threshold levels that were used for this beam test are listed in the following table,

These threshold setting were determined by direct measurement of an Fe 55 source with each of the 80 channels of ASDBLR.

## 3 Data Taking

The data acquisition system used for the barrel module system was a slightly modified version of a system used by TRT group for many years. This system is described in a previously published paper. (Reference: T. Akesson, et al., "Electron Identification with a Prototype Transition Radiation Tracker for the ATLAS experiment", CERN-PPE/97-161, Submitted to NIM, section A.) The data taken was recorded remotely on tapes at the CERN computer center using standard remote recording software. After data taking was complete the data tapes were replayed using a modified version of the online data monitoring software and PAW column-wise NTtuples were created to serve as data summary tapes (DSTs)

### TDC- and DAQ

The data acquisition system was modified from its configuration in the reference by removing the HIPPI destination cards used to read out the previous prototype and by adding to an existing CAMAC crate commercial TDC modules used to digitize data for the barrel prototype. As mentioned previously, a total of 80 straws were instrumented for both the high and low threshold channels yielding a total 160 TDC channels being read-out.

During data taking, data acquisition was constantly monitored to ensure that equipment failure was not spoiling the data taken. For a limited sample of events on selected straws, the drift distance to drift time relationship was plotted. This relationship is very sensitive to many possible failure modes. Using the beam chambers and silicon strip detectors the beam position was constantly monitored to ensure that the beam was illuminating the narrow band of fully instrumented straws. The online monitoring also gave immediate results of the fraction of events that were generating high threshold hits - another crucial test of data validity.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline  & & **Correspon** \\  & **Voltage** & **Energy** \\
**Threshold** & **(mv)** & **cut (eV)** \\ \hline LOW & 425 & 200 \\ LOW & 470 & 250 \\ LOW & 515 & 300 \\ LOW & 600 & 400 \\ HIGH & 431 & 4000 \\ HIGH & 505 & 5000 \\ HIGH & 570 & 6000 \\ HIGH & 650 & 7000 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Threshold settings.

### On-line display

Another way that data was monitored was with an event display as shown in Figure 3-1.

During each beam burst, the information from one event was made available for plotting a detailed map of which straws were hit. Straws with low threshold hits were marked in black on the plot and straws with high threshold hits were marked with a star. Also plotted were details of the hits in the beam chambers and silicon strip detector. A close up view of the hits in the barrel module prototype is shown in Figure 3-2.

### Writing to disk and Ntuple production

The data was first written to a disk in the H8 beam line which served as a local buffer. When the data run ended and the data acquisition closed the file on the local disk, an automatic process copied the data over to a staging disk at the CERN computer center. Once a complete run was received at the computer center it was written to two different very high density data tapes. Each of the data tapes was capable of holding \(\sim\)30 GB. The network connection between the H8 beam line and the computer center was sufficiently fast that in the time that next data run was taken the previous run could be sent to the computer center. In the event of a network failure, the local buffering disk was sufficiently large that the about 12 hours of data taking could be stored. Individual runs typically consisted of 50,000 events and were about 300 MB in size. While the data was waiting on the computer center staging disk to be put onto the data tapes it was available for full analysis using the ATLAS offline computers which allowed selected runs to have all of their events analyzed with the full online mon

itoring software with an approximately 2 hour delay. Once the running period was finished, all data runs were processed into DSTs using a slight modification of the online monitoring code. As mention previously the output of these jobs were column-wise NTuples 25-40 MB long (about a 10-fold reduction from the raw data sets) and could be processed directly with the CERN analysis program PAW. All information included in analysis routine data structures (e.g. beam chamber hit position, TDC read-outs, etc.) was available as elements in the NTuple. By writing a simple routine which restored information in the NTuple into the standard data structures used by the online/offline data analysis code, it was possible to run the analysis code without staging the raw data tapes to disk.

## 4 Analysis of resolution

### Track Reconstruction

The first step to obtain the resolution is to reconstruct tracks over the two modules. The track reconstruction is done with the aid of the track parameters (slope and intercept) from the silicon telescope. Using the track parameters, tracks are extrapolated to the modules. The plot of drift time vs distance from the wire was generated (V plot) for each active straw tube. Figure 4-1 show a typical V plot from a straw. The x-axis is the distance from the sense wire calculated using silicon and y-axis is the drift time.

From the V plots, the offset and rotation angle between the silicon telescope and modules are estimated. The offset is obtained from the first straw tube and the angle is obtained from the first and last straw tubes. The estimated parameters are refined later using the reconstructed tracks from the modules.

Using the estimated values, an extrapolated track from the silicon telescope is projected to each straw to search for hits. If there is a hit within 600 microns of the extrapolated track, the hit is tagged. The tagged hits are collected and their drift times are converted to a distance to calculate the space coordinates. The coordinates are fitted with a straight line (without B field), or a circle (with B field), and the intercept and slope are calculated. Figure 4-2 shows the difference between the track slope calculated using the silicon and the modules. Figure 4-3 show the intercept difference. Figure 4-4 shows the number of straw hits per tracks.

The time to distance relationship is calculated from the V plots from all active straws. The plots are fitted with a polynomial (x=a0+a1*t+a2*t*t) and the average values are used for the time to distance conversion resolution.

#### 4 Analysis of resolution

Figure 4-3: 1 The intercept differences between the silicon and the module track determination (mm).

Using the reconstructed tracks, the residuals are calculated and plotted in Figure 4-5. The resolution can be calculated from the residual and the number of hits used in the fit. The residual and the resolution are the same as the number of hits approaches to infinity.

In Figure 4-5, only tracks with number of hits greater than 15 are used, thus this plot is basically the resolution of a straw tube. As mentioned in earlier sections, data were taken over a range of several quantities: 1. ASD threshold. 2. Beam distance from the readout electronics (attenuation effect) 3. Beam angle with respect to modules. 4. With magnetic field (1.56 T) on or off.

## 5.0Analysis of Transition radiation

The analysis of the response of the two barrel modules to a 20 GeV electron and pion beam is an important step in understanding the transition radiation properties of the modules. In the central section of the modules a type of radiator (LPR) that had proven to be the best radiator in small sample test. This is shown in Figure 5-1. We filled the remainder of the module with thin sheets of radiator (Veledon), which had been used in the 50 cm CERN prototype. Part of the study was to compare the performance of the two radiators. In addition we examined the response as a function of the incident angle of the beam and the distance of the beam from the electronics end of the 75 cm wire. All measurements of transition radiation that we will report were done with the modules in the horizontal position out side of the beamline magnet. Due to beam line scheduling we were unable to use a 20 GeV beam during the last few days of the run when the module was placed in the magnet.

### Angles, positions, and Thresholds

During the data taking, the modules were positioned to have the beam enter at three different locations. These are shown in Figure 5-1. In the set up called A, the beam entered through the LPR radiator at a position about 70 cm from the electronics. For the setup called B the beam entered through the Veledon radiator at a position of \(\sim\)55 cm from the electronics. This was the maximum distance we could position the beam from the electronics end for this radiator type. The entry point for set up B was also the point of entry for the angle tests, since the region of LPR radiator was not long enough to contain the beam at large entry angles. In the third position set up, C, the beam entered near the electronics about 10 cm from the end.

With the beam entering at B position, we rotated the modules in their holder with respect to the beam at angles of 90, 70, 50 degrees. These position setups were designated D, E, F as shown in Figure 5-2

We took data at all setup points with a range of high threshold settings. These thresholds corresponded to 5. keV, 6. keV and 7. keV energy desposited. We calibrated the electronics and straws prior to running using an Fe 55 source.

### Alignment and cuts

The incident beam passed through two silicon strip chambers before entering the modules. These chambers define the beam position and allow us to project the tracks into the chambers and determine the position of the incident particle in each of the straws. The beam layout is showing

Figure 5-1: Positions of beam entrance into modules

Figure 5-2: Rotations of modulesin Figure 3-1. The alignment software that had been developed for the earlier tracking study was used for this study. A different set of constants was needed for each of the module positions, A-F.

By requiring that there be a low threshold hit in a particular straw and plotting the position of the projected track in the silicon detectors for this event, we get the distributions shown in Figure 5-3 and Figure 5-4.

They are shown here for the first and last straw of each module. Alignment was done by examination of the edge positions and the average position of all events and then rotating the modules and vertically shifting the modules as a unit. The zero position of each straw is the theoretical position determined from the construction coordinates of the end-plates. At the end of the alignment process the straw showed averages that were typically less than 30 microns.

There were a number of cuts applied to the events on an Ntuple. For electrons we required that the response of tge cerenkov counters and the lead glass were constituent with an electron. While for a pion they had to be consistent with a minimum ionizing particle. The cuts are shown in the Table 5-1.

### The efficiency calculation

In order to calculate the efficiency for a particular straw, the Ntuple for a particular pion or electron run was processed on a local workstation. Several histograms were compiled and written out for later display and processing. SUM was the number of single tracks in the silicon array that project to +-1.9 mm of the straw's theoretical position. The number of these tracks that also had a low threshold hit were recorded as LOW. The number of tracks that had a high threshold hit were HIGH. These were summed up for the entire run for all events. The efficiency for high hits is recorded as HIGH/SUM and the efficiency for low hits is LOW/SUM.

The beam size for the electron runs was about 4 cm in diameter and about 2-3 cm for the pions runs. There are many straws that are on the edge of the beam profile and are not uniformly illuminated by the beam. Straws of this type were eliminated from the display by cutting on the STRAW-SUM values for a particular run. This eliminated many of the straws, but allowed us to compare only fully illuminated straws for the radiator comparisons, the angle studies, and the position studies.

### Radiator material study

We have directly compared the transition radiation efficiency for the two types of radiators in the module. We took data in Run A at 80 degrees through the LPR radiator. This radiator had an average thickness of 4 mm as measured by X-ray pictures of the module after construction. The corresponding local density is about 0.08 gm/cm\({}^{3}\). The Veledon radiator was composed of thin 0.5 mm sheets that formed a radiator region with a density of about 0.13 gm/cm\({}^{3}\). Data was collected from a total of 12 different runs in both A and B positions. The pion and electron data for A and B was taken at three thresholds.

In Figures 5-5. the electron and pion efficiency for 6 keV for the two modules are shown for the LPR radiator.

In Figures 5-6. the same is shown for the Veledon radiator. In order to compare the performance of two straws, the pion efficiency has been plotted vs. the electron efficiency (per straw) for one of the final straws in the modules. This is shown in Figures 5-7, Figures 5-8, Figure 5-9 and Figure 5-10 for several different straws near the backside in each module.

Our conclusion is that there is a consistent shift of the curves to a lower pion efficiency for the LPR radiator. This give a small but significantly better performance for the LPR. This is consistent with the previous beam test running for small samples, but this is the first time it has been measured with the punched radiator, and the realistic straws.

### Angle dependence

The analysis of these events was identical to the previous analysis. The sum, high, and low histograms were collected for each of the runs. The electron and pion efficiencies for both modules at 80 degrees, 60 degrees, and 45 degrees are shown in Figures 6-11 and Figures 6-12. Then the electron-pion efficiency for a particular straw as a function of the angle shown in Figures 6-13 through Figure 6-16 for several individual straws in both modules. As the angle decreases both the electron and pion efficiencies rise.

### Position dependence

The position dependence can be displayed by comparing the 80 degree runs at two different beam entrance positions. The electron and pion efficiencies as a function of Z position in the module are shown for the two different runs, B and C. These are shown in Figure 5-17 and Figure 5-18

The straws at the back of the Indiana module and the back of the Duke module are shown in Figure 5-19, Figure 5-20, Figure 5-20, Figure 5-21.. In all cases the efficiency is somewhat lower when the beam enters close to the electronics. We believe that the principle cause is the reflection of the signal from the unterminated end of the wire. This results in two overlapping pulses which combine to form a higher amplitude pulse when the entering beam is near the unterminated end, and less of an overlap when the beam enters near the electronics when the reflected pulse is shifted later by about 3 ns.

### Comparison of front and back modules

The efficiency of the modules as a function of the position along the beam track is shown in an earlier figure, Figures 5-5 and Figures 5-6.

There is an obvious increase in the electron efficiency in each module with the distance into the radiator, while the pion efficiency remains about constant as a function of distance. The gross features can be explained due to the distribution of radiator material and the fact that the transition radiation has a range of several centimeters in the radiator and straws. A large amount of scatter in the efficiency can be seen and is attributed to the differing amounts of radiator in front of each straw. (Due to the straw layout there is a regular variation of "free "radiator in front of each straw.)

The backside shell of the module in front and the frontside of the shell of the second module absorbs the low energy component of transition radiation. (800 microns of carbon is one attenuation length for 7 Kev photons). The first straw of the second module therefore shows a reduction of efficiency, but it is about 5% higher than the corresponding straw in the first module. This is probably due to some of the higher energy transition radiation generated in the first module penetrating into the second module. The Monte Carlo also shows the straw to straw variations of 3-4% similar to that seen in the data.

## 6 Summary

The two 1.3-meter-long modules that were constructed at Duke University and Indiana University in 1997 have been tested in a beam line at CERN. The set of wires along the beam were instrumented with a "close to final" ASDBLR. High and low thresholds level signals were read out with TDCs instead of the DTMROC. Both modules were shipped without incident, no wires were broken, and all wires ran at full voltage. During a two week period we were able to study the performance with high energy beams, 20 Gev beams of pions and electrons and with the modules both in and out of the magnetic field.

### Resolution

The modules were run at several threshold values for the low threshold. The measure resolutions for these runs are given in Table 4.1. At the lowest threshold we are within the specification required for the position resolution. The resolution was measured with the modules in a magnetic field of 1.8 T in the same orientation that will be used in the tracker. Also in this case, the resolution was better than 140 Microns. Monte Carlo studies of the resolution are in progress.

### Transition radiation

The transition radiation studies were the first detailed study of the full size modules in a beam. The threshold dependence for the range 5 keV to 7 keV has been shown for an number of individual straws in the main text. A typical number for the single straw efficiency at 6 keV is 0.26 +- 0.1 with a pion giving 0.05 +- 0.1. The selected radiator (LPR) (density 0.8 gm /cm3) showed better performance, i.e, higher electron efficiency at the same pion efficiency than another candidate radiator (density 1.5 gm cm3) used previously. The angular dependence was also studied. The pion efficiency at 20 Gev increased somewhat faster than a simple geometrical path length. More studies with the final radiator will be required to understand this effect. We have used these results to calibrate the MC, adjusting the gain to match the pion results, and the radiator efficiency factor to match the electron results. With these adjustments (done globally for the module, not wire by wire) the MC shown in Figure 6-2 match the data in very well. The resulting adjusted MC can be used to predict the performance of the full tracker. This is done in the following section

### Monte Carlo calibration

The beam test allows us to calibrate the Monte Carlo using a test module. This calibration for the barrel section of the detector will proceed over the next few years as more modules are tested and details examined. We have attempted to run the newly calibrated Monte Carlo on the barrel tracker. This is an initial study and not yet finalized. In particular there is still a small difference in the spatial resolution simulation. The main upgrade is in the gain and transition radiation performance. The Monte Carlo appears to give quite accurate predictions for the effects of the module shells and theabsorbtion of the radiator for the first module. We have run the Monte Carlo with 20 Gev electrons and pions injected near normal incidence and determined the electron and pion efficiency as a function of the number of high threshold clusters used to identify an electron. This is shown in Figure 6-3. A cluster size of six will give a 90% electron efficiency and a factor 13 for e/p rejection.

These results are similar to those presented in the TDR and in previous publications1. We conclude that the prototype modules will function as valuable electron identifiers in the central region. There are a number of continuing studies on the beam test data that will be reported later.
