reject the ZZ continuum, and therefore it plays an important role to guarantee the robustness of the discovery.

This note is organised as follows. In chapter 2, the Monte Carlo samples used are presented and the treatment of the uncertainties described. Chapter 3 focuses on the signatures of the signal, while the characteristics of the background processes are reviewed in chapter 4. Chapter 5 describes the performance of the selection cuts proposed in terms of efficiencies and rejection power, paying special attention to forward tagging. Results about discovery significance are given in chapter 6, and chapter 7 gives an estimate of the resolution in the mass measurement. Finally, conclusions are given in chapter 8.

## 2 Monte Carlo samples and theoretical uncertainties

All the signal and background samples have been produced using the PYTHIA 6.103. Detector effects have been simulated with ATLFAST 1.62, with the high luminosity option that degrades \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) resolution to account for minimum bias effects. This analysis is not significantly affected by these resolutions, as it only makes use of very hard cuts in \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) and \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). Therefore, the same samples have also been used for studies concerning the low luminosity period. The only relevant minimum bias effects on this analysis come from the forward jet tagging, and have been considered explicitly.

Theoretical uncertainties in the generation of the Monte Carlo samples affect the estimation of the significance and the mass sensitivity. There are two relevant sources of theoretical uncertainty, which are described below. Both of them are believed to affect only the cross-sections, but not the event properties [10].

The first source of theoretical uncertainty comes from the lack of knowledge on the structure function of the partons inside the protons. Implications in terms of cross-section can be estimated comparing predictions from different models. The comparison yields a 5% effect for the signal, and a 20% effect for the ZZ continuum [10]. No results are available for the rest of (minor) backgrounds, but the contribution is expected to be negligible.

Another source of systematic uncertainty is the simulation of the interaction itself. The PYTHIA generator uses leading logarithm (LL) approximations. Extension to next-to-leading logarithm (NLL) increases the cross-section of some processes significantly. In the case of the 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

The effect of missing orders is expected to be negligible at the lowest masses considered in the present analysis, but can be very significant near the TeV mass region [13]. In particular, the width of the resonance can become significantly larger. Nevertheless, the present analysis in the very high mass case could serve as a reference for a generic resonance, after correcting for the width and cross-section.

Figure 3.2 shows the cross-section multiplied by the branching ratio (\(\propto\)BR) of H\(\textgreater\)ZZ\(\textgreater\)\(\ell\)\(\nu\)vv a function of m\({}_{\text{H}}\) in the relevant range, as predicted by PYTHIA 6.103. The contribution of each process is plotted separately. Note that all the cross-sections decrease as the mass increases, but gluon fusion decreases more steeply.

The two quarks that scatter in the Z/W fusion remain in the final state, and hadronise becoming a pair of jets in very forward and backward directions. In the events where they are not lost through the beam pipe, they provide a clear signature for tagging the qq\(\textgreater\)qqH (forward jet tagging).

Figure 3.2: H\(\textgreater\)ZZ\(\textgreater\)\(\ell\)\(\nu\)v cross-section as calculated by PYTHIA. The boson and gluon fusion contributions are plotted separately, as well as the WW and ZZ contributions to boson fusion.

Figure 3.31 shows the \(\eta\) distribution of the jets reconstructed by ATLFAST, for the gluon and the Z/W fusion cases, showing the peaks in the forward and backward directions for the later. Another additional feature of the signal sub-sample selected by forward jet tagging (Z/W fusion events) is that the invariant mass distribution can be easily separated from the backgrounds, making it more sensitive to the Higgs mass reconstruction (see section 3.2.3).

Footnote 1: Histograms shown in chapters 3, 4 and 5 are not normalised to a value of integrated luminosity, as they only intend to show kinematic properties of signal and background events. In chapters 6 and 7, where the results are shown, all histograms are normalised as indicated in the figure captions.

Only events with two leptons reconstructed are plotted.

### Signatures

#### Two high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) leptons in the central region

A massive Higgs transfers a high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) to the decay products. Figure 3.4 shows the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) distribution of the two Z's for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\)=500GeV and \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\)=900GeV.

Note that the average value of the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) increases with \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\).

The transverse momentum of the Z decaying to a pair of leptons will be measured experimentally as \(\ \vec{p}_{T\ell\ell}=\vec{p}_{T\ell 1}+\vec{p}_{T\ell 2}\). The distribution of \(\mathrm{p_{T\ell\ell}}\) is shown in figure 3.5, while figure 3.6 shows the distribution of \(\mathrm{p_{T\ell\ell}}\)- \(\mathrm{p_{TZ}}\) (that can be interpreted as a resolution) for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\)=500GeV, and separately for events with electrons and muons in the final state. For both cases non-Gaussian low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) tails appear, while the Gaussian resolution is wider for muons than for electrons.

Figure 3.7 shows the \(\eta\) distribution of the Z's. They populate mostly the central region (\(\eta\)|<2). Figure 3.8 shows the \(\eta\) distribution of the leptons from Z\(\gamma\)\(\ell\ell\), before and after the detector simulation by ATLFAST.

Figure 3.5: distributions of \(\rm p_{T\ell\ell}\) reconstructed by ATLFAST, for \(\rm m_{H}\)=500 and 900GeV. Only events with two lepton tags from ATLFAST are included.

Figure 3.6: difference between \(\rm p_{T\ell\ell}\) reconstructed by ATLFAST and ’true’ \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Z from PYTHIA, for \(\rm m_{H}\)=500GeV and for events with the Z decaying to electrons (left) and to muons (right). This difference can be considered as an indication of the resolution of the measurement of the \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Z.

Figure 3.8: \(\eta\) distribution of the leptons of the signal for m\({}_{\rm H}\)=500GeV and m\({}_{\rm H}\)=900GeV. Solid histograms are the PYTHIA output, while dashed lines correspond to ATLFAST reconstruction. Only events where two leptons are detected according to ATLFAST are included in the dashed histograms.

Another signature of the two leptons that can be used in the selection is their invariant mass, which follows the Z line shape, as shown in figure 3.9.

#### Large \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\)

The high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the Z decaying to neutrinos is observed as missing \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\). Figure 3.10 shows the distribution of \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\)(=\(\left|\vec{p}_{T}^{\,\,\,miss}\right|\)) for the two reference Higgs masses, as predicted by the resolution parameterisations of ATLFAST. Figure 3.11 shows the distribution of the difference between the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\) reconstructed and the 'true' \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the Z from PYTHIA, separately for events with muons and electrons in the final state.

Figure 3.9: Invariant mass of the two leptons as reconstructed by ATLFAST. Only events in which ATLFAST detects two leptons are included.

Figure 3.10: \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\) from ATLFAST for the signal, at \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\)=500 and 900GeV.

#### The transverse mass (m\({}_{\rm T}\)) distribution

In a pp collider, energy and momentum conservation cannot be applied to perform a complete kinematical reconstruction of events with neutrinos in the decay chain. Therefore, the invariant mass of the ZZ system cannot be measured, but one can still define the _transverse mass_, which is also closely related to the mass of the Higgs. It is defined as follows:

\[m_{T}^{2}\equiv\left[\sqrt{m_{Z}^{2}+p_{T\ell}^{2}}+\sqrt{m_{Z}^{2}+\left|p_{T }^{\,miss}\right|^{2}}\,\right]^{2}-\left[\vec{p}_{T}\left(\ell\ell\right)+ \vec{p}_{T}^{\,miss}\right]^{2}\]

It is equivalent to the invariant mass of the ZZ system in the case where the bosons are produced transversally to the beam axis. Transverse mass combines \({\rm p_{T\ell}}\) and \({\rm E_{T}}^{\,miss}\) in an observable that is optimally sensitive to the mass of the Higgs resonance.

The 'true' invariant mass (m\({}_{\rm ZZ}\)) distributions are plotted in figure 3.12 for several Higgs masses, with the contribution of the Z/W fusion shown separately. Owing to the fall of parton densities with increasing energy, the total distribution does not peak at the Higgs mass, and the spectrum is not the expected from a simple propagator [14]. Note also that the gluon fusion component is much more distorted than the Z/W fusion component. The edge in the distribution for low m\({}_{\rm H}\) corresponds to the phase space boundary.

The m\({}_{\rm T}\) distributions for several Higgs masses are plotted in figure 3.13.

Figure 3.11: difference between \({\rm E_{T}}^{\,miss}\) (from ATLFAST) and the \({\rm p_{T}}\) of the Z decaying to neutrinos (from PYTHIA), for events with the Z decaying to electrons (left) and muons (right).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:15]

Figure 4.2: distribution of the \(\rm p_{t}\) of the two Zs for a sample of 100K events of the ZZ continuum, from PYTHIA. The peak value of the distribution is much lower than in the case of the signal at any \(\rm m_{H}\) (see figure 3.4).

Figure 4.3: distributions of \(\rm E_{T}\)\({}^{\rm minis}\)(left) and \(\rm p_{t/}\)(right) in the ZZ continuum background, from ATLFAST. Only events with two lepton-tags form ATLFAST are considered. The resolutions of both measurements are smaller than the bin size, and therefore both distributions are quite similar to the distribution of \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Zs from PYTHIA (compare with figure 4.2).

### The ZW\(\supset\ell\ell\)m\(\ell\) continuum

The main process contributing to this background corresponds to PYTHIA code 23, with a generated cross-section of 1630fb. It can be suppressed very efficiently by rejecting events with more than two identified leptons. A fraction of the remaining events, with one lepton escaping the acceptance of the detector, can still be rejected by requiring the two leptons to be charge-conjugated. Globally, requiring two and only two, same-flavour and opposite-charged leptons rejects 48% of the ZW events.

The distribution of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the Z is similar to that of the ZZ continuum (see figure 4.5), while the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution peaks at a lower value (figure 4.6).

Figure 4.4: 'true' \(\eta\) distribution of the Zs of the ZZ continuum, from PYTHIA.

Figure 4.5: Distribution of the ‘true’ \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the Z in the ZW continuum background. Again, the peak value is well below the one of the signal (see figure 3.4).

### 4.3 The WW continuum

The major contribution to this background corresponds to the process with code 25 in PYTHIA, with a generated cross-section of 3008fb. All possible leptonic decay modes were allowed in the generation, including \(\tau\nu\ell\nu\).

Even in the less favourable case (WW\(\rightarrow\)\(\ell\nu\ell\nu\)), this background is easily reducible: the neutrinos tend to have back-to-back momentum that cancels the global \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\). Requiring a charge-conjugated lepton pair and \(\mathrm{m_{\ell}}\) compatible with \(\mathrm{m_{Z}}\) rejects effectively this background, as shown in the next chapter. The lepton-pairing requirement rejects 48% of the events.

The following figures 4.7 and 4.8 show the \(\eta\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) distribution of the W's, as well as the measured \(\mathrm{p_{T\ell}}\) and \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions expected from ATLFAST.

Figure 4.7: \(\eta\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) distribution of the Ws in the WW continuum, from the PYTHIA output.

### 4.4 The Z+jet(s) background

At the LHC energies, the main contributions to the Z+jets final state come from the diagrams in figure 4.9, which correspond to PYTHIA processes 30 and 15 respectively. The cross-section of a single Z\(\cPq\ell\) plus one or more jets is 6-10\({}^{8}\)fb, at least seven orders of magnitude larger than that of the signal, and therefore this background needs to be kept very safely under control. The missing \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) comes from two sources: _real_\(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) from neutrinos inside jets, and _fake_\(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) coming from bad reconstruction of the jets. The jet may either escape (out of the limit of calorimeter coverage or through a crack), or develop partly in the dead material of the detector, faking a momentum unbalance.

This background is therefore very sensitive to details of the hadronic calorimeter performance, that ideally should be studied using a full simulation of the detector. This work does not include such a study, and just shows the potential danger of the contributions to \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) from neutrinos and limited \(\eta\) coverage of the calorimetry. However, full simulation with earlier

Figure 4.9: main diagrams that contribute to the Z+jets production at LHC.

versions of the geometry [16] concluded that the high \(\rm E_{T}\)\({}^{\rm miss}\) tails are dominated by the two effects considered here, and that contributions from detailed geometry effects are small2.

Footnote 2: The study was repeated with the TDR geometry layout, and the same conclusions were reached. See section 9.2.2 of the ATLAS Physics TDR, CERN/LHCC/99-14.

The huge cross-section of this background represents a technical problem for the simulation (6\(\cdot\)10\({}^{10}\) expected events for a year at high luminosity), solved by using a _production cut_ at the PYTHIA level in the \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Z. As shown in chapter 6, a minimum cut of 150GeV in \(\rm p_{T/\ell}\) and \(\rm E_{T}\)\({}^{\rm miss}\) will be applied in this analysis, and therefore there is no need to generate events with a lower \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Z, provided that a certain security margin is applied to account for detector effects.

Figure 4.10 shows the 'true' distribution of the \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Z in this background, from PYTHIA. The steeply falling behaviour shows the convenience of the production cut. Figure 4.11 shows the \(\rm\sigma\)\(\times\)BR generated by PYTHIA as a function of the \(\rm p_{T}\) threshold.

The \(\rm p_{T}\) cut applied was 135GeV. For the generated sub-sample, \(\rm\sigma\)\(\times\)BR=17010fb (1.7 millions of events after one year at high luminosity, a reduction of a factor 376). Figure 4.12 shows \(\rm p_{T/\ell}\) as a function of \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Z, proving that there are no events passing the 150GeV cut affected by the production cut.

Figure 4.10: The exponential distribution of \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Zs in the Z+jets background, in linear (left) and logarithmic (right) scales. A cut at the production level can avoid from simulating a large fraction of the events.

Figures 4.13 and 4.14 explore the properties of the jets. The former shows the average energy deposited by the jets across all the \(\eta\) range, and the later plot the contribution of the two sources of \(\rm E_{T}^{\rm miss}\) computed by ATLFAST: neutrinos and jets escaping the calorimeter acceptance.

Figure 4.12: \(\rm p_{T^{(\ell)}}\) reconstructed as a function of the ’true’ \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Z. Applying a cut at 135GeV at the production level does not bias the analysis if a selection cut with \(\rm p_{T^{(\ell)}}\)\(>\)150GeV is s applied.

5 The \(\mathrm{\bar{t}\bar{t}\rightarrow\gamma WbWb\rightarrow\ell\mathrm{\,mb}\ell \mathrm{\,mb}}\) background

The lowest-order production processes are shown in figure 4.15, and correspond to PYTHIA processes 81 and 82, with a total generated cross-section of 2.7\(\cdot\)10\({}^{4}\)fb. The signature of this background is similar to that of WW, but includes the two additional b-jets. Neutrinos are therefore produced with smaller \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\), and the average \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\) is lower, but the huge cross-section makes it necessary to check that it is safely under control. As in the Z+jets case, a cut in \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) at the production level is applied, with a somewhat lower efficiency because of the harder distribution of \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\). In addition, the correlation between the variable used for the production cut (the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the top) and the quantities used in the selection (\(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T\ell}}\)) is much lower in this case than for Z+jets (see figure 4.16), and therefore the value of the cut has to be set at a smaller value.

Figure 4.16: distribution of \(\rm p_{T}\) of the ts and t(bar)s in the tt(bar) background by PYTHIA. The distribution peaks at a larger values than the in Z+jets, and therefore a \(\rm p_{T}\) cut at the production level is less efficient.

Figure 4.15: diagrams that contribute to tt production at the LHC energies.

Figure 4.17 shows \(\mathrm{E_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) versus the \(\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\) of the top with minimum \(\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\), for a sample with a cut in the invariant mass and in the \(\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\) of the two-lepton system (86GeV\(<\)m\({}_{\ell\ell}\)\(<\)96GeV and \(\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\)\(>\)150GeV). As indicated in next chapter, these two cuts will be applied throughout the analysis in this work.

The cut at the production level was set to 85GeV. From figure 4.18, the number of events with \(\mathrm{E_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)\(>\)150GeV and with \(\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\)\(<\)85GeV, is estimated to be just a few percent of the total, hence introducing a tolerable bias. For the \(\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\)\(>\)85GeV sub-sample, the cross-section is 17210fb (1.7 millions of events after one year at high luminosity), with a reduction factor of only 1.6 (in Z+jets it was 376).

Figure 4.17: \(\mathrm{E_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) reconstructed versus ’true’ \(\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\) of the top with minimum \(\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\). Unlike the Z+jets background, the correlation between the product of the hard interaction process and reconstructed \(\mathrm{E_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is weak.

Note that most of the events with \(\mathrm{E_{\mathrm{T}}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)\(>\) 150GeV have \(\mathrm{p_{\mathrm{T}}}\)\(>\)85GeV.

### 5.4 Lepton momentum

The average \(\rm p_{T}\) of the leptons is higher for the signal than for the backgrounds (see figure 5.4), due to the higher \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Z's in the signal. The efficiency-rejection power of a cut in \(\rm p_{T}\) is found to be optimal with a threshold around 40GeV of both leptons. This cut is strongly correlated with the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(\rm p_{T_{\ell}\ell}\) cut, and therefore the rejection power is lower after applying the cuts proposed in the previous sections. Table 5.4 shows the efficiency and the rejection of this cut.

**Sample** & **Efficiency** & **Rejection** \\ \hline H500 & 0.799 & 1.251 \\ \hline H600 & 0.821 & 1.218 \\ \hline H700 & 0.840 & 1.191 \\ \hline H800 & 0.862 & 1.160 \\ \hline H900 & 0.857 & 1.167 \\ \hline H1000 & 0.859 & 1.164 \\ \hline

### Forward jet tagging

For the sub-sample of the signal produced by Z/W fusion, an extra signature can be exploited to ensure a good control of the irreducible background. As shown in figure 3.3, quarks remaining in the final state are detected in a good fraction of the events as jets in the forward region, defined by 2\(<\)\(\left|\eta\right|\)\(<\)5 (5 is the limit of the ATLAS calorimeter coverage).

Another important feature of forward jet tagging is that the distribution of \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) of the selected sub-sample, consisting mainly of Z/W fusion events, is much more distinct from that of the backgrounds. This is due to the fact that the distribution of \(\mathrm{m_{ZZ}}\) of the Z/W fusion events is much less distorted by parton momentum distributions (see sub-section 3.2.3).

Figure 5.4: distribution of reconstructed \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) for the lepton with minimum \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\), for all pre-selected events.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:30]

Figure 5.5 shows that when the seed is increased to 5GeV, the efficiency drops to 60% in 2\(\updownarrow\eta\)\(<\)4, and to lower values for larger \(\eta\). The fake probability integrated in one \(\eta\)-hemisphere at a 5GeV seed is about 0.1 [18]. Due to the low correlation between minimum bias jets (see [17] again), the probability of fake forward and backward jets in the same event is about 0.01. Other studies have shown that this fake probability can be reduced by optimising the energy threshold of the jet-reconstruction algorithm. In particular, optimisation of the threshold shows promising results [18].

The tagging efficiency estimated with ATLFAST with a 1.5GeV seed for the signal is shown in figure 5.6. To compute it, two samples of qq\(\rightarrow\)qqH\(\rightarrow\)qqZZ events with m\({}_{\rm H}\)=500 and 1000GeV were used. The production cut in the \(\rm p_{T}\) of the WW pair in the study corresponding to figure 5.5 is comparable to the cuts in the \(\rm p_{T}\) of the ZZ used in this work, and the Higgs mass is in the same range. Therefore, it has been assumed that the behaviour when increasing the seed in our sample would be similar to the case studied in the TDR. Following this assumption, the deterioration of the tagging efficiency caused by going from a 1.5GeV to a 5GeV seed was simulated, as well as a pessimistic fake probability, as discussed in the above paragraph.

Figure 5.6: single forward jet tagging efficiency of ATLFAST, with and without cut in the \(\rm p_{T}\) of the Zs. Solid line corresponds to m\({}_{\rm H}\)=500GeV, and dashed to m\({}_{\rm H}\)=1000GeV. The ATLFAST tagging efficiency is roughly independent on the cut and the Higgs mass.

For the implantation of the deterioration of the efficiency, the forward region (2\(<\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\)5) was divided into four bins, surrounding the four \(\eta\) values studied in figure 5.5. For each bin, a mean value for the ATLFAST efficiency was calculated, and then divided by the efficiency at a seed of 5GeV in figure 5.5, in order to obtain factor of deterioration of the efficiency. Table 5.5 summarises the values of the mean efficiency and the factors applied in each \(\eta\) bin. To simulate the fakes, a fraction (0.1 for one tag and 0.01 for forward-backward tag) of the events from signal and backgrounds are randomly accepted in this study.

In fact, the fake probability depends on the background process. The probability of a minimum bias _boosting_ a jet to an \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) enough to be tagged is dependent on the event topology. However, from a full simulation study [18] that computes this fake probability for several backgrounds, it can be concluded that our assumption of 0.1 and 0.01 fake probabilities are pessimistic enough to absorb the slightly different probabilities for different backgrounds.

#### Efficiency and rejection factors for one and two jet tags

Two options have been studied: single and double jet tagging. In the first, a jet with \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\)\(>\)15GeV is required in the 2\(\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$<$}}\) 15 region. In the second, two jets with the same \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) threshold are required, one in the forward direction and the other in the backward direction.

Tables 5.6 and 5.7 show the results for the signal at different mass values and for the background processes. Also the fraction of qq\(\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$>$}}\)qqH events in the signal is shown. Results for high luminosity include the reduction of forward jet tagging efficiency and the fake probability due to minimum bias.

### Discarded cuts

#### Azimuthal angle between \(\mathrm{p_{T}}_{\ell\ell}\) and \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\)

In the mass range between 500 and 1000GeV, the two Zs are produced almost back-to-back. This could _a priori_ help to kill backgrounds where \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}_{\ell\ell}\) directions are less correlated, like those in which \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\) comes from jets outside the calorimeter coverage. Figure 5.7 shows the distributions of the deviation (in radians) from the back-to-back direction for signal and backgrounds, using events passing the pre-selection cut.

Figure 5.8 shows the same distribution for the pre-selected events that also pass the invariant mass cut and the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) cuts. Table 5.8 shows the efficiency of a cut at 0.6 radians. The only background that is reduced more significantly than the signal is the \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) background. Therefore, this cut deteriorates the significance, and was discarded for the analysis.

Figure 5.7: distribution of the deviation from the back-to-back direction in the transverse plane (in radians), from the reconstructed difference \(\phi_{\ell\ell}\)-\(\phi^{\mathrm{\,miss}}\). All pre-selected events with two lepton tags from ATLFAST are included.

#### Angular distribution of the leptons

The Standard Model Higgs boson decays mainly into longitudinal-polarized Z's [19], and that gives a characteristic structure to the angular distribution of the leptons in the Z rest-frame. In background processes like the ZZ continuum, the Z's are not polarised and the angular distribution in cos\(\theta\) is flat. The distribution is shown in figure 10, for the signal and for the ZZ and Z+jets backgrounds. The momentum of the leptons is boosted to the Z rest-frame, and \(\theta\) is then defined as the angle between the Z direction and the boosted momentum of the lepton. There is a potential rejection power in these distributions, which decreases when other cuts are previously applied. That is because the cuts favour events resembling the signal topology. Figure5.10 shows the same angular distributions for events having passed the lepton pairing, invariant mass and \(\rm{E_{T}}^{\rm{\,{missing}}}\) and \(\rm{p_{T\ell\ell}}\) cuts. Even not being useful as a selection criterion, the shape of the distribution of the signal is slightly more peaked at \(\pi\), and this could be used as a confirmation of the nature of the coupling.

Figure 5.10: Same distributions as in figure 5.9, but with only events that pass cuts in the lepton pairing, invariant mass and \(\rm{E_{T}}^{\rm{\,{missing}}}\)/\(\rm{p_{T\ell\ell}}\). The separation power is suppressed when the cuts are applied.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:37]

the discovery is very sensitive to the accuracy of knowledge of the backgrounds (this situation is usually referred to as a _counting experiment_). This is the case for this analysis if no forward jet tagging is applied and, in this situation, S/B becomes a safer estimator of the likelihood of the discovery.

Results are presented in two sections. The first shows the S/B and S/B expectations after one year at high luminosity. The second section shows the expectations for three years at low luminosity, corresponding to the estimated complete low luminosity running period of LHC.

The selection cuts applied are summarised in table 6.1. The threshold values are common to the analysis corresponding to all Higgs masses and to all luminosity conditions, except for \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T\ell^{\prime}}}\). For these two cuts, the value that has been optimised for every combination of \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\) and integrated luminosity (as justified in section 5.3, the value of the threshold is the same for the two cuts).

It is not only the significance that has been taken into account to optimise the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)/\(\mathrm{p_{T\ell}}\) cut. The final number of signal events is also important to guarantee robustness under statistical fluctuations. The criterion chosen is to take the value that provides a better S/B, but providing more than 20 (15) signal events, for high (low) luminosity. The restriction in the number of events is softer for the low luminosity period because a cleaner environment is foreseen.

All the results are given for three cases: with no forward jet tagging, with one tag, and with forward and backward tags. For high luminosity, the jet-tagging efficiency is reduced to account for the effect of minimum bias, following the procedure explained in section 5.5.

Theoretical uncertainties are treated as explained in chapter 2. It is assumed that the only effect is an uncertainty in \(\mathrm{\SIdiamondsuit}\)BR, not affecting the shape of the distributions. A normalisation

factor (_k-factor_) of 1.5 is applied in the ZZ continuum distributions to correct for the fact that PYTHIA computes the cross-section with the LL approximation instead of the NLL one. No k-factor is applied to the signal (chapter 2, again). Uncertainties in the other backgrounds are not considered because their contributions are negligible compared with that of the ZZ continuum, as seen in table 5.6 and later in this chapter.

### Expectations for one year at high luminosity

The expected integrated luminosity after one year at high luminosity is 100fb-1. Results can be re-scaled to the full LHC run simply by scaling the number of signal and background events to the number of years. When scaling, S/B remains unchanged, but the choice of the optimised \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)/\(\mathrm{p_{T_{\ell}}}\) cut may depend on the integrated luminosity considered because a minimum number of signal events is required.

In figures 6.2 to 6.4, the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions of signal and backgrounds are presented, for each value of \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\) and for each of the three options concerning forward jet tagging. A'minimum' \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)/\(\mathrm{p_{T_{\ell}}}\) cut of 150GeV has been applied, and the contribution of each component of the background is indicated.

In order to optimise the significance, higher values of the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)/\(\mathrm{p_{T_{\ell}}}\) threshold have to be applied. Table 6.2 shows the number of expected signal and background events, as well as S/B and S/\(\backslash\)B for each mass and for each threshold considered. Note that for almost all the cases there is a maximum in the significance for a given threshold value. Only for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\)=900GeV and 1000GeV with double forward jet tagging option, the maximum significance corresponds to less than 20 signal events.

Figures 6.5 and 6.6 summarise the results concerning S/B and S/\(\backslash\)B after one year at high luminosity. The statistical significance and S/B versus \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\) for the three tagging options is presented. The significance that appears is the maximum guaranteeing a minimum of 20 signal events. The error bars correspond to the propagation of the theoretical uncertainties in the ZZ continuum and in the signal cross-section.

A good S/\(\backslash\)B (always \(>\)5) is reached with and without forward jet tagging. This indicator does not improve significantly while applying the tagging technique. In the S/B plot, on the contrary, the values increase in a large factor when one and two tagged jets are required. Forwardjet tagging reduces strongly the fraction of backgrounds, and therefore the Monte Carlo expectation is much less sensitive to background uncertainties, and analysis of the results after applying tagging gives a more robust indication of new physics than with no tagging.

The number of final events with and without forward jet tagging is a test the SM nature of the resonance, because the fraction of Higgs produced by gluon fusion and Z/W fusion is predicted by the theory. Finding the expected amount of signal with the three options (no tagging, one tag and two tags) would add robustness to the discovery of a SM Higgs boson, while finding a deviation would be a sign of non-SM physics.

For masses m\({}_{\mathrm{H}}\)>800-900GeV, the value of S/B drops drastically, but in that range the H\(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{ }}}}}}}}}}}}}}\)\(\ell\)v\(\nu\) results can be used simply as a cross-check of the expectations for a SM Higgs boson. In the 'low' mass range (m\({}_{\mathrm{H}}\)=500GeV), the discovery significance is good, and if a resonance is discovered in the gold-plated H\(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{ }}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}\)\(\boldsymbol{4}\ell\), the channel studied here can be used again as a cross-check of the SM nature of the resonance, by comparing the number of events with and without forward jet tagging.

The contributions of the individual backgrounds are shown as shadowed areas. The \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)/\(\mathrm{p_{T_{\ell\ell}}}\) cut is set to 150GeV. The shape of the distribution is not strongly modified by the signal, and therefore the discovery potential is very sensitive to the uncertainty in the level of backgrounds.

The level of backgrounds is reduced compared to the analysis without forward jet tagging, but the shape of the distributions is still not sensitive to the signal.

**Distributions of \(\mathbf{E_{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) for 100fb-1. Double jet tagging.**

The number of background events is strongly reduced by the double forward jet tagging.

The \(\rm E_{T}^{\rm miss}\)/\(\rm p_{T}\) threshold for each mass corresponds to the maximum S/B in table 8.1. The large S/B for the forward jet tagging analysis makes it robust against background uncertainties.

Figure 6.6: S/B for one year at high luminosity versus \(\rm m_{t}\), for no forward jet tagging, and for one and two tags. The \(\rm E_{T}^{\rm miss}\)/\(\rm p_{T}\) cuts are the optimum for S/B.

### Expectations for 3 years at low luminosity

After the expected first three years of low luminosity (30fb\({}^{-1}\)), the statistics will be 3/10 of the one collected after a year of high luminosity (100fb\({}^{-1}\)). This makes the discovery difficult for a heavy Higgs boson, because of statistical fluctuations. However, results demonstrate that at least indications of the discovery should appear after this period.

The efficiency of forward jet tagging during the low luminosity period will benefit from the much lower minimum bias. Also the resolution of measurements as \(\rm{E_{T}}^{\rm{miss}}\) and lepton momenta will be better, although these do not affect this analysis significantly, in view of the high thresholds applied on these quantities.

In figures 6.7 to 6.9 the \(\rm{E_{T}}^{\rm{miss}}\) distributions after 3 years at low luminosity are shown, for a minimum \(\rm{E_{T}}^{\rm{miss}}\)/\(\rm{p_{T\ell}}\) threshold of 150GeV. Table 6.3 shows S/B and S/\(\sqrt{\rm{B}}\) versus the value of the \(\rm{E_{T}}^{\rm{miss}}\)/\(\rm{p_{T\ell}}\) threshold, for no tagging and for the two jet tagging options. Figures 6.10 and 6.11 show the maximum values of the significance as a function of \(\rm{m_{H}}\), requiring a minimum of 15 signal events. In some of the cases there is no possible value of the \(\rm{E_{T}}^{\rm{miss}}\)/\(\rm{p_{T\ell}}\) threshold providing more than 15 events. In these cases the value considered is selected by trying to optimise the significance and the number of events. The values of the threshold used in this case are surrounded by a black square in table 6.3.

The values of S/\(\sqrt{\rm{B}}\) are slightly lower than after one year at high luminosity. S/B values are higher because the criterion of a minimum number of 15 events cannot be kept in most of the cases. Therefore results shown in figure 6.11 have to be interpreted carefully, because the number of expected events is sometimes low (see cells with a black square in table 6.3). Here again one can play the trick of comparing distributions with and without tagging to get more robustness.

## Chapter 6 Conclusions

Figure 6.7: \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions for the selected events, after three years at low luminosity and for no forward jet tagging. The contributions of the individual backgrounds are shown as shadowed areas. The \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)/\(\mathrm{p_{T}}_{\mathrm{T}\ell\ell}\) cut is set to \(150\mathrm{GeV}\). As no forward jet tagging is applied, distributions are the same as for one year at high luminosity, but scaled to the smaller statistics.

The contributions of the individual backgrounds are shown as shadowed areas. The \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}/\mathrm{p_{T_{\ell}t}}\) cut is set to 150\(\mathrm{GeV}\). The level of backgrounds is reduced compared to the analysis without forward jet tagging, but the shape of the distributions is still not sensitive to the signal. Note that the situation here, compared with the 100fb-1 sample, is slightly better than a simple scaling of the statistics, because the reduction of forward jet tagging efficiency caused by minimum bias is not present here.

The contributions of the individual backgrounds are shown as shadowed areas. The \(\rm E_{T}^{\rm miss}\)/\(\rm p_{T_{\ell\ell}}\) cut is set to 150GeV. Note the low statistics. As in the previous figure, the situation is better than a scaling of the statistics of the 100fb-1 case, because no deterioration of the forward jet tagging efficiency has been applied.

### Extension of the results to other models

A heavy SM Higgs is nowadays believed to be very unlikely. However, the results shown in the two previous sections can be extended to models that predict similar resonances, like some technicolor models [20] in the gluon fusion channel or strong interaction models [21] in the Z/W fusion channel. The significance of the signal predicted by a given model can be estimated by scaling results shown in tables 6.2 and 6.3. The width of the resonance must also be taken into account.

Some general and model independent statements can be given for search of resonances in the Z/W fusion and gluon fusion channels. For resonances in the Z/W fusion channel, forward jet tagging can be applied, and the discovery criterion of S/\(\backslash\)B\(>\)5 is applicable. It sets a requirement on the signal of about \(\sigma\)\(\times\)BR\(>\)3fb for resonances of mass over 500GeV, and for 100fb\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

For resonances in the gluon fusion channel, the situation is more complicated. The signal only appears as an excess of events, and the discovery potential will depend on how well the cross-section and shape of the background is controlled. As an indication, with the background level presented in tables 6.2 and 6.3, S/\(\backslash\)B\(>\)5 corresponds to \(\sigma\)\(\times\)BR\(>\)3fb for resonances of mass over 500GeV, and for 100fb\({}^{\text{-1}}\).

## 7 Sensitivity to the Higgs mass

In the H\(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{ \boldsymbol{   }}}}}}}}}}}}}}\)\(\ell\)\(\nu\)v channel the invariant mass of the Higgs cannot be reconstructed, and the mass information has to be extracted from the transverse mass (m\({}_{\text{T}}\)). Figures 7.1 to 7.3 show the m\({}_{\text{T}}\) distributions for the backgrounds and the signal, once the cuts described in the previous chapter have been applied. Again, the plots are shown for no forward jet tagging, one tagging and two taggings. Note that the shape of the distribution of the ZZ continuum is very similar to that of the signal at low m\({}_{\text{H}}\), because the selection cuts in E\({}_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}\) and p\({}_{\text{T}\ell\ell}\) favour events with signal-alike kinematics.

As explained in sub-section 3.2.3, the shape of the distribution of the signal does not correspond to a simple propagator, and information on the Higgs mass is not only in the position of the peak but in the whole shape of the distribution. Therefore, an optimal method to extract theinformation implies a direct fit of the distribution with Monte Carlo samples generated with different Higgs masses.

This work does not include a study of the performance of such a fit. Instead, the sensitivity to the Higgs mass is estimated statistically in a simple way based on the mean, the RMS and the number of events of the \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) distributions. This simple approach is not possible without applying the forward jet tagging, because the fraction of background events is large, and the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/\mathrm{p_{T_{\ell\ell}}}\) cut has to be tuned for a specific value of the Higgs mass to get a good S/B. As \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) is closely related with \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T_{\ell\ell}}}\), the shape of the \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) distribution is therefore dominated by the cut, and the mean of the \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) distribution is highly biased by the value of the cut chosen.

There is still another effect that makes impossible a simple approach for a selection without forward jet tagging. If no tagging is applied, the selected sample includes signal events produced by the gluon fusion process, whose \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) distribution is strongly distorted by the parton density function (see figure 3.12).

Figure 7.1: \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) distributions for the selected events, for one year at high luminosity and no forward jet tagging. The contributions of the individual backgrounds are shown as shadowed areas. The \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}/\mathrm{p_{T_{\ell\ell}}}\) cut is set to 150GeV. The ratio between the number of signal and background events is low, and the analysis is very sensitive to the level of knowledge of the backgrounds.

**Distributions of \(\mathbf{m_{T}}\) for 100fb-1. Single jet tagging.**

Figure 7.2: \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) distributions for the selected events for one year at high luminosity with single jet tagging. The contributions of the individual backgrounds are shown as shadowed areas. The \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,{miss}}}\)/\(\mathrm{p_{T\ell/\ell}}\) cut is set to 150GeV. The level of backgrounds is lower than in the distributions with no forward jet tagging, but the shape of predicted distribution is still sensitive to uncertainties in the background.

## Chapter 6 Conclusions

Figure 7.3: m\({}_{\rm T}\) distributions for the selected events for one year at high luminosity with double jet tagging. The contributions of the individual backgrounds are shown as shadowed areas. The \(\rm{E_{T}}^{\rm{miss}}\)/\(\rm{p_{T_{\ell}t}}\) cut is set to 150GeV. The level of backgrounds is strongly reduced, and therefore the prediction of the distribution is robust under background uncertainties. Note that the mean and the width of the distribution increase with \(\rm{m_{H}}\).

If jet tagging is applied, the \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) distribution clearly peaks at \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\) and, in addition, the background level is low enough to allow a good S/B with a low and common \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,{miss}}}/\mathrm{p_{T\ell}}\) cut for all the \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\) range (see figures 6.2 to 6.4 for 100fb-1, and figures 6.10 to 6.12 for 30fb-1). Then the mean of the \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) distribution can be used as an unbiased estimator of the Higgs mass. Approximating a Gaussian behaviour, the statistical uncertainty in the mean is given by RMS/N, where N is the number of events.

Figure 7.4 shows the dependence of the mean of the \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) distribution on the Higgs mass, with the statistical uncertainties as error bars. Results are shown for 100fb-1 (one year at high luminosity), and for an \(\mathrm{E_{T}}^{\mathrm{\,{miss}}}/\mathrm{p_{T\ell}}\) cut of 175GeV.

The line in figure 7.4 can be used as a calibration curve to measure the Higgs mass from \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\). The calibration curve has to be built by a study of Monte Carlo samples of signal plus backgrounds at several values of \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\). A source of systematical error in the curve is the uncertainty in the generation of the backgrounds. To estimate this effect, the analysis of the \(\mathrm{m_{T}}\) distributions was repeated for pure signal samples, with no backgrounds included. The difference between the mean of the distributions with and without backgrounds estimates the systematic effect that must be unfolded.

Table 7.1 shows the statistical uncertainty and the contribution of the backgrounds in the mass measurement for each generated \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\). Uncertainties have been estimated graphically propagating those in \(<\)\(\mathrm{m_{T}}\)\(>\), by projecting the vertical error bars on the curve. Precision decreases in the measurement for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\)\(\geq\)900GeV, due to the flattening of the curve, to the decrease

of the total number of events, and to the increase of the width. Results are shown for one year at high luminosity. For \(n\) years, the statistical uncertainty scales as \(1/\!\sqrt{n}\).

In summary, it has been proved that the channel presents a good sensitivity to the Higgs mass when double jet tagging is applied. The errors quoted here have to be taken as a pessimistic estimate, because in a more sophisticated analysis the whole shape of the distribution can be fitted. In particular, the approach used here does not make any use of the information given by the width of the distribution. An overall fit of the distributions can also profit from a crosscheck between results from the analyses with and without forward jet tagging.

## 8 Conclusions

* The H\(\rightarrow\)ZZ\(\rightarrow\)\(\ell\)VV channel provides good discovery significance for the SM Higgs with m\({}_{\rm H}\) between 500 and 1000GeV for an integrated luminosity of 100fb-1. The value of S/\(\!\sqrt{\rm{B}}\) within this mass range is always above 5 with and without forward jet tagging (see summary in table 8.1). The channel can be used as a crosscheck at the lower and higher limits of the mass region studied, where other channels are more favoured (H\(\rightarrow\)ZZ\(\rightarrow\)\(4\ell\) and H\(\rightarrow\)WW\(\rightarrow\)\(\ell\)Vjj respectively).

The statistical uncertainty comes from the projection in the mass axis of RMS/\(\!\sqrt{\rm{N}}\) of the m\({}_{\rm T}\) distribution. The second column gives an estimate of the maximum systematic uncertainty, which would correspond to the case of no information on the shape of the backgrounds.
