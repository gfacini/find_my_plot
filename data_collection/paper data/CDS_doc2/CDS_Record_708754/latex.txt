**Abstract**

The impact of the Muon Spectrometer end-cap misalignments (rotations) relative to the barrel, on the reconstruction of the SM H\(\rightarrow\) 4 \(\upmu\) and MSSM H/A\(\rightarrow\) 2 \(\upmu\) has been extensively studied. A 1mrad EC rotation, with respect to the axis perpendicular to the beams, reduces the SM Higgs signal by \(\sim\) 2% and the MMSM H/A signal by less than 5%, respectively. A study of a specific sample of \(Z\) events with at least one muon in the misaligned region can reveal the problem, in order to be corrected off-line.

## Introduction

The present note is a continuation and extension of a previous note (Ref [1]). As previously stated, our main goal is to estimate the influence of the barrel versus end-cap ATLAS Muon spectrometer possible misalignments, on the searches for the Higgs to muons decay channel(s).

Within the barrel and within the end-caps, the relative position of the Muon chambers will be accurately controlled and continuously monitored, within few tenths of microns, thanks to sophisticated optical systems - praxial platforms for the barrel and alignment bars for the end-caps (Ref [2]). However, the relative barrel and end-cap position will be less accurately known, since there are no direct optical links between the two parts of the spectrometer. For this reason we decided to study the effect of the possible misalignments on specific physics signatures. We first studied the SM Higgs to four muons signature followed by a study of MSSM H/A to two muons signature. The results of the previous study showed that the Higgs to four muons discovery potential is very little affected by end-cap displacements and rotations with the exception of large rotations of end-cap sectors around axes perpendicular to the beams, where we observed a significant inefficiency in the muon reconstruction. However, these particular rotations, which are NOT global EC-rotations, will be detected by the forward alignment system (if they exceed a few hundreds microrads).

## Simulation/reconstruction

Since our study concerns the position of the Muon spectrometer, we have concentrated on the simulation and reconstruction of the Muon detector part. We started using the relatively fast muon-only stand-alone generation (LHCTOR) and reconstruction (MUONBOX) programs, considering the _muon-only information on the track momentum determination_. The generation/simulation chain, together with the selection criteria are presented in Ref [1]. In this note we used the full simulation data produced by DC1 and reconstructed them with ATHENA version 6.0.3 (Ref [3]). As a result, we were able to _combine the muon spectrometer information on the tracks with that of the inner detector_ in order to simulate a more realistic analysis of the misalignment.

In order to simulate the effect of the misaligned muon spectrometer we have reconstructed the simulated data (simulated with LHCTOR in the old study and with full simulation in this study) with the MUONBOX program which used a MDT geometrical database where the respective rotation was introduced for _only one end-cap_. For reasons explained before, only end-cap rotations with respect to an axis transverse to the beams proved to significantly affect the searches. Therefore, in this note we considered only these rotations around the x-axis - which were performed by rotating **each** EC sector (EI, EM and EO) by the same angle around axes which were parallel to each other but their center was located at the z-position of the corresponding sector. The rotations applied were by 1, 2.5 and 5 mrads, angles higher than the accuracy allowed by the alignment system, but used in order to produce an observable effect.

## STUDY of the SM HIGGS  to four muons decay

For the present study we used the DC1 simulated Higgs data for the H\(\rightarrow\)ZZ* decay\(\rightarrow\)4\(\mu\)'s for three different Higgs masses 130,150,180 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) (Ref [4]). We then created new muon-ntuples from reconstruction with the rotated data basis. The muoninformation on the muon track was either used as stand-alone (named muon-only case hereinafter) or combined with the inner detector information (named combined hereinafter). The combined track information was obtained using the weighted average momenta measured in the two different detectors, in an approach similar to STACO (Ref 5).

We then asked for four "good" reconstructed muons, two negative and two positive ones. On each muon a set of kinematic cuts was applied: \(|\eta|\)\(<\)2.5, the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of at least two muons to be largest than 20 \(\mathrm{GeV/c}\) and the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the other two muons to be larger than 7 \(\mathrm{GeV/c}\). On the two-muon opposite sign combinations a set of mass cuts was applied: the mass of one two-muon combination (the one closest to the Z) to be \(\mathrm{M_{Z}}\)\(\pm\)15, \(\pm\)10, \(\pm\)6\(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\), and the mass of the second combination to be greater than 20, 30, 60 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\)=130,150,180 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) respectively.

Table 1 shows the efficiency of each set of cuts for the three different Higgs masses studied. As a last cut, the requirement that the four muon combination is contained within a two sigma mass window centered around the nominal Higgs mass, was applied.

In order to improve the resolution of the Higgs mass we used a constrained Z mass fit. As explained in the previous note, where the relevant Higgs masses were high enough (200, 300 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\)) so that the two Z's were real, we constrained _both Z's_ to a mass given by a BW probability, after minimization of the \(\chi^{2}\) of the kinematical quantities described therein. In the present study, since only one Z is real, we applied the same constrained mass fit but only for the **(one)** two-muon combination which had a mass 70\(<\)m\(<\)110 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\), if it existed.

Figure 1 shows the reconstructed Higgs masses before and after the fit, for the combined information or muon-only information for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\)=130 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\), Fig. 2 is the same as the previous figure for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\)=150 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) and Fig. 3 shows the same for \(\mathrm{m_{H}}\)=180 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\). Since in all cases the intrinsic Higgs width is small, the resolution is dominated by the experimental width. The reduction of the width is of the order 25%, 20% and 10% for the three masses respectively. We, therefore, conclude that the constrained fit significantly improves the signal/background ratio in the Higgs searches, even in the case where the combined (MUON+ID) track information is used.

large tan\(\beta\) values the associated production becomes the dominant one. We have chosen to study the cases of m\({}_{\rm A}\)=200 and 300 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) and tan\(\beta\)=15, since they represent a "typical" case. For these and higher mass Higgses we expect that a possible misalignment of the muon spectrometer will produce a much more pronounced effect than the previously studied cases of the Z and H. The H/A decay products have larger momentum and are directed more forward in rapidity (80% of the events have at least one muon in one of the end-caps) which makes them more sensitive to the end-cap misalignment.

Since the DC1 analysis has not produced H/A\(\rightarrow\) 2\(\upmu\) simulation event files, we were constrained to follow the generation/simulation/reconstruction chain described in Ref 1. This provides much faster results but at the expense of information. Namely, provides muon-only spectrometer information. The comparison of this kind of analysis with the full simulation and reconstruction one, was already done in the Higgs to four muon case. As explained before, it showed that the produced results were similar, if of course the muon-only information was used. On the other hand, since we want to study the effect of the uncertainty of the alignment on high momentum particles, where the momentum resolution is dominated by the muon spectrometer, there the inner detector information does not help much. We have generated samples of 5,000 events decaying to two muons for direct and associated production separately for masses of 200 and 300 GeV/c\({}^{2}\). The natural widths are of the order of 0.8 and 1.2 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) respectively. For the generation of the specific channels we used the PYTHIA version 6.203 which has not all the production mechanism corrections implemented. The kinematical distributions of the direct and associated production events are mostly similar, with the exception of the average momentum. The associated production muons have a few tenths of GeV/c lower momenta than the direct production ones. We have performed all the analysis separately for the two productions mechanisms and at the end we combined them weighted according to their relative production cross-sections given in Ref 6. The cuts applied to the samples were: two opposite sign muons each with \(|\)y\(|\)\(<\)2.5, and \(\rm p_{T}\) largest than 20 GeV/c. This last cut has high efficiency (95% for direct and 93% for associated production respectively). The effective masses for the H/A of 200 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) mass is shown in Fig 10a and b for the two production mechanisms. In the case of Higgs to two muons decay, there is no mass constraint to improve the resolution but this was found of no relevance in the SM H case as far as the alignment studies were concerned.

For these studies, we have performed rotations of one end-cap by 1 and 2.5mrads. About 40% of the events have at least one muon in the rotated end-cap. Fig 11 shows the relative change of the H/A width as a function of rotation for the two different masses. In general the increase of the width is much more pronounced here, than in the SM Higgs sample. Fig. 12 shows the relative 2\(\sigma\) width acceptance as a function of rotation for the two different masses. The acceptance for the 300 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) H/A drops more than the one for the 200 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) case as expected, since the resolution deteriorates with the momentum. We have also studied the effect of the noise addition in these data. The impact of the noise is very similar to the previously reported impact on the SM Higgs case.

## Conclusions

We have rotated the EC Muon Spectrometer Sectors relative to the barrel around axes perpendicular to the beams. The maximum misalignment that can escape detection by the forward alignment system **is a few hundrends of microrads**. For rotations of less than 1mrad, the SM H\(\rightarrow\) 4 \(\mu\) signal is not influenced much. This is particularly true in the case where the combined inner detector/muon spectrometer information is used for the muon momentum determination, since the effect is half of the corresponding one when the muon-only information is used. The Higgs width gets less than 5% larger and the number of accepted events- within a 2 sigma window-diminish by less than 2%. The MSSM H/A\(\rightarrow\) 2\(\mu\) signal, which has been studied using the muon-only information, is influenced more by the rotations, as expected, since its decay muons have higher momentum and are directed more forward. Its width gets larger by \(\sim\)15% and the number of accepted events- within a two sigma window- diminish by \(\sim\)5 %. In both cases -SM and MSSM Higgs- the introduction of noise in the hit chambers reduces the overall acceptance by few percent but does not seem to significantly affect the impact of misalignment.

Furthermore, a study of specific Z events with one muon in the misaligned region and reconstructed using the muon-only information, has shown that this sample can be used as **additional** tool for detecting EC-sector misalignments. The sensitivity of this Z sample is large, both on the width (1mrad rotations increase the width by 20%) and on the absolute mass position. Furthermore, such samples can be used for checks on the calibration/validation of the muon spectrometer.
