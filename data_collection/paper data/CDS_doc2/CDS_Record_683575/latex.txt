Introduction

The routing of the fibers for the extended barrels of Tilecal has been studied using the same approach as for Module 0. An "a la barrel" geometry [1] was used and light budget calculations allowed to obtain a readout configuration that optimizes the uniformity with minimum loss of signal compatible with the geometrical and mechanical constraints. The estimatives for the uniformity that would be obtained are within the required range. Mock up instrumentation showed that the larger length and number of fibers due to the spread of cells in extended barrels does not compromise the mechanical feasibility.

## 2 Light budget

The same guidelines used for the routing of the barrel module 0 [2] were followed in this study. The light budget calculations aimed to obtain the following conditions:

* small non-uniformity inside the cells (prototype values of about \(\pm 5\%\) used as guiding numbers)
* maximum possible light output, to keep prototype photostatistics
* the fiber length should be the minimum, to minimize fiber direct response in the girder region, and minimize the cost
* small spread of light output from cell to cell, to allow PMT's to work at similar gains

Light budget was calculated using the same simple optical model already used in [3] and [2].

The purpose of the present study was the feasibility of the routing in the extended barrel with the design method used for Module 0 implementation. Therefore the same values were used in the parametrizations of fiber and tile light output for comparison purposes.

Geometry

The geometry that was used follows the same approach as that for the routing in barrel module 0. The radial segmentation has 3 layers corresponding to the 3 longitudinal samplings A, BC and D. The sampling BC is internally divided in subsamplings B and C. To each (sub)sampling corresponds a set of tiles with the same radial size: 3 tiles of 10 cm, 3 tiles of 13 cm, 3 tiles of 15 cm and 2 tiles of 19 cm (therefore this geometry is also called '3-3+3-2'). The \(\eta\) segmentation is obtained by segmenting each of this (sub)samplings in a pseudoprojective way, obtaining 0.1 segmentation on A and BC and 0.2 on D (with exceptions for the external cells).

This cell geometry is shown in Fig. 1.

## 4 Fiber length calculations

The length of fibers was calculated with the same method as in module 0. The fiber length in each cell is defined by the distance between the PMT hole and the groove corresponding to the most distant fiber.

The fibers within a cell have only one of two lengths, short or long. The long one reads the first tile in the cell corresponding to the smaller calorimeter radius.

A certain length is added to the constant length of fiber that is required to read the respective tile(s) inside the module:

* the straight distance from the layer of tiles that is most far away from the PMT that reads the cell to the PMT position in the girder;
* a length of 7 cm for the fibers to bundle inside the bundle tubes;
* an extra length of 5.5 cm to allow the fibers to have curvature radius greater or equal to than 5 cm;
* an extra length, depending of the cell, ranging between 1 and 3 cm, to allow the sub-bundles of fibers winding smoothly among them.

Readout configuration

For cells of samplings A and D, the configuration that allows the maximum light output/minimum fibre length should have the PMT of each cell located in the girder in a Z position coincident with the geometrical center of the cell. For cells of sampling BC there are 2 sub-samplings with different fibre lengths and different tile light output, making the uniformity worst inside the cell. Thus, the respective PMT positions should be eventually displaced to the B or C side, to balance tile/fibre light output for the tiles of the two sub-samplings. As in the barrel, the ideal situation is not possible because there is a limited number of PMT holes in the girder and the cells have to be distributed by those holes. However, the smaller number of cells in the extended barrel allows to have more PMT holes to choose for.

As starting point for the choice of the configuration, the PMT's of the BC cells are centered as much as possible, and A and D cells are shifted from center as less as possible, filling the remaining holes. Global light budget is calculated for this configuration, and the PMT's of BC cells are displaced to positions that allow a better uniformity inside BC cells, followed by displacements of A and D cells PMT's. This procedure is repeated until the best uniformity inside BC cells is achieved. In situations of similar uniformity the chosen configuration is the one that gives more light output to A cells.

The location of the PMT's of each cell of the proposed configuration is shown in fig. 2 and the lengths of fibers that correspond to this configuration are presented in fig. 3.

## 6 Light budget

Light budget calculations were made using parametrizations for the tile light output and for the fiber light output. The parametrizations and the values of the parameters are the same that were used in the design of the routing of fibers for barrel Module 0[2].

The light budget is summarized in fig. 4, where the values of tile light output were normalized to tile number 1. In fig. 5 the same values are shown but with a normalization for the smaller tile in each cell.

Non uniformity inside the cells are within the required range of about \(\pm 5\%\). Values of non uniformity of \(\pm 6.5\%\) inside BC cells may be lowered with an increase of the fiber lengths for C  cells.

## 7 Mock up implementation

The geometry and routing proposed above were implemented in the Lisbonaquette. The proposed solution was feasible and the implementation in theaquette was much easier than we could foresee for cells so large as those of sampling D.

In figs. it is shown theaquette with the fibers before and after their routing to the PMTs.

## 8 Conclusion

The routing of the fibers using 'a la barrel' (3-6-2) geometry is mechanically feasible. Light budget calculations give estimatives for non uniformity inside the cells within the required range (about \(\pm 5\%\)) and a complete proposal of routing is described.
