###### Abstract

The "little Higgs" model has been recently proposed as a possible solution to the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model. In this model a new charge 2/3 quark \(T\) is predicted with a mass in the TeV range. In this note we show how such a particle can be studied by observing its decays into \(tZ\) or \(Wb\). Due to the low expected signal cross-section, results are presented assuming an integrated luminosity of \(300\)fb\({}^{-1}\) which will be collected after a few years of running of the LHC at its design luminosity of \(10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\).

Introduction

A theoretical model which has been recently proposed to solve the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model is the "little Higgs" model [1, 2]. The overall ATLAS potential for the discovery and the study of the little Higgs model is discussed in Ref. [3]. This note serves as an additional background information on the discovery potential of the colored vector-like particle (\(T\)), required by the little Higgs model to cancel out the top-quark loop terms.

In the "littlest Higgs" model [4] considered here, and for which we adopt the notation of [5], this particle is expected to decay into \(tZ\), \(tH\) or \(bW\) with a branching ratio of 25% for the first two channels and 50% for the latter one. The detection of the \(T\) particle is important to estabilish the model and the measurement of its mass can be used to extract some of the parameters of the model.

We will discuss how the decay \(T\to Wb\to l\nu b\) can be used to discover the \(T\) particle up to a mass of about 2 TeV. This signature, however, is the same as that expected from a fourth generation quark which is coupled to the third family, so additional evidence has to be searched for by looking at channels with a lower event yield. The decay chain \(T\to tZ\to 3l+1b\)-jet\(+X\) is by a flavor changing neutral current and is expected to be suppressed for a fourth generation quark. It constitutes a clear signature for the \(T\) particle and can be used to confirm its discovery for masses up to about 1.1 TeV. The other signature \(T\to tH\) is discussed elsewhere [6]. In all cases a mass peak can be reconstructed by grouping all the decay objects together with the missing transverse energy expected from the missing neutrino from the \(W\) decay. The signal over background achievable is of the order of 1:2, in the case of the \(Wb\) decay channel and about 3:1 in the case of the \(tZ\) channel. The presence of a peak in the mass distribution makes it possible to normalize the backgrounds using a side-band method, thus evidencing the presence of a signal as a peak on a falling background.

In section 2, the production cross-section for the signal and the background will be discussed, describing also how events have been generated using Pythia together with other matrix element MonteCarlo generators and simulated using Atlas.

In section 3 a simple set of cuts is proposed and the efficiency for the signal and the main backgrounds is shown. The event yield expected for \(300\mbox{fb}^{-1}\) is also summarized.

Section 4 discusses how the mass of the \(T\) can be reconstructed, as opposed to the background where no resonant behavior is present. The statistical significance for the detection of the \(T\) will be discussed giving a limit on the cross-section as a function of the mass of the \(T\) quark.

## 2 Signal and background cross section: Generation and Simulation of the events

The \(T\)-quark can be produced at the LHC via two mechanisms: QCD production via the processes \(gg\to T\bar{T}\) and \(q\bar{q}\to T\bar{T}\) which depend only on the mass of the \(T\); and production via \(W\) exchange \(qb\to q^{\prime}T\) which leads to a single \(T\) in the final state and therefore falls off much more slowly as \(m_{T}\) increases. This latter process depends on the model parameters and, in particular, upon the mixing of the \(T\) with the conventional top quark. The Yukawa couplings of the new \(T\) are given by two constants \(\lambda_{1}\) and \(\lambda_{2}\):

\[\lambda_{1}(iQht_{R}+fT_{L}t_{R}-\frac{1}{2f}T_{L}t_{r}hh^{\dagger})+\lambda_{2} f(T_{L}T_{R})\]

where \(h\) is the Standard Model Higgs doublet, \(Q\) is a doublet containing the left-handed top and bottom quarks \((t_{L},b_{L})\), and \(t_{R}\) is the right handed top quark. The physical top quark mass eigenstate is a mixture of \(t\) and \(T\). These couplings contain three parameters \(\lambda_{1}\), \(\lambda_{2}\) and \(f\) that determine the masses of the \(T\) and the top quark as well as their mixings. Two of the parameters can be reinterpreted as the top mass and the \(T\) mass. The third can then be taken to be \(\lambda_{1}/\lambda_{2}\). This determines the mixings and hence the coupling strength \(tbW\) which controls the production rate via the \(qb\to q^{\prime}T\) process.

The production cross-section for the \(T\) quark is shown in figure 1 taken from Ref. [7], as a function of \(m_{T}\), for three different values of \(\lambda_{1}/\lambda_{2}\). It can be seen that single production dominates for masses above 700 GeV. As we expect that we are sensitive to masses larger than this, we consider only the single production process in what follows. The single production cross section is also reported in table 1 for the masses for which data samples have been generated for this work, for different choices of the Yukawa coupling constants for the \(T\)-quark (for details see Ref. [5]).

The generation of the events has mostly been done using Pythia 6.203 [8]. The production of particles in the little Higgs sector is not implemented in Pythia. Thus to generate \(T\) events with the correct decay chain the fourth generation matrix element calculation, available in Pythia, has been used. The \(t^{\prime}\) is produced by Pythia through the \(W-g\) fusion process which is the dominant mechanism, so that the kinematic of this process is correct. Finally the \(T\)-quark is forced to decay into \(tZ\) or \(Wb\) and the production cross section used is the one from table 1. The Pythia settings for the generation are the following:

-- Select 4th generation:  msel = 0  msub(83) = 1  msub(82) = 1  mstp(7) = 8

-- Mass of T is 1 TeV, width is 1 GeV:  pmas(8,1) = 1000.  pmas(8,2) = 1.

-- V CKM with b quark:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c c c} Mass (TeV) & 0.7 & 1.0 & 1.3 & 1.6 \\ \hline XSec (fb) \(\lambda_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\lambda_{2}\) & 240 & 48 & 12 & 2 \\ XSec (fb) \(\lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}\) & 1000 & 200 & 45 & 12 \\ XSec (fb) \(\lambda_{1}=2\lambda_{2}\) & 4200 & 800 & 200 & 60 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: _Production cross section used for different value of the \(T\) mass._vckm(4,3) = 1.0

-- For decay in Zt:

brat(71) = 1

kfdp(71,1)= 23

kfdp(71,2)= 6

-- For decay in Wb:

brat(71) = 1.

kfdp(71,1)= 24

kfdp(71,2)= 5

The backgrouds are discussed in the next subsections. When possible they have been generated using Pythia. AcerMC [9] has been used to produce \(Zb\overline{b}\) and \(Wb\overline{b}\) and CompHEP [10] has been used for the \(tbZ\) and single top production and interfaced to Pythia for the hadronization.

When charged leptons are concerned, only gauge boson decays into electrons and muons have been considered, as the decays into \(\tau\) are expected to give a small contribution both to the signal and to the backgrounds due to the presence of softer leptons1. Decays into \(\tau\) were considered only for the \(ZZ\) background, as the leptonic \(\tau\) decays are the only significant source of missing energy after 3 charged leptons are required.

Footnote 1: This chÃºice has been made to reduce the CPU time needed to process the events.

The simulation of the events has been done using ATLFAST [11] in the release 5.3.0 of the ATLAS software framework. All the A11fast defaults have been used, and the high luminosity \(b\)-tagging performances were assumed with a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of 50%. The A11fastB package has been used to calibrate the jet energy and to parameterize the \(b\)-tagging performances.

### Backgrounds to the \(T\to tZ\) process

The backgrounds to the \(T\to tZ\) channel yielding a three lepton signature are summarized in table 2, together with the total cross-section, the number of events simulated and the generator used. The \(t\bar{t}\) and the \(Zb\bar{b}\) backgrounds have a much larger cross-section than the other backgrounds. However the third lepton is coming from the fragmentation of a \(b\)-quark, and is expected to be soft and not isolated. Previous studies indicate that these backgrounds can be controlled if a \(P_{T}>40\)GeV cut is applied on the leptons [12]. It will be seen that here, the additional constraints that two of the leptons form the \(Z\) mass (in the \(t\bar{t}\) case) and that missing \(E_{T}\) be present (in the case of the \(Zb\bar{b}\)) are sufficient to reduce these backgrounds to the level of a fraction of one event for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\).

### Backgrounds to the \(T\to Wb\) process

The backgrounds considered for the \(T\to Wb\) process are summarized in table 3. In this case events with a hard single lepton are considered as a background, and the number of jets in the event will be used to reject the \(t\bar{t}\) background. In the kinematic region considered here and given the \(b-\)tagging requirement, the \(W+\)jets background contribution is dominated by \(W+b\bar{b}\) which is what was simulated. The single top contribution is split into \(s\)-channel production, with a \(tb\) pair produced by the decay of a off-shell \(W\), and everything else (\(t-\)channel production).

\end{table}
Table 3: _Background samples generated for the study of the \(T\to Wb\) channel._The analysis cuts

For both decay processes studied in this work, a set of loose cuts has been defined. The choice of a loose set is motivated in part by the fact that the signal production cross section time branching ratio is very small, and we do not want to apply cuts resulting in a low efficiency for the signal. In addition, we apply loose cuts in order not to bias the invariant mass distribution of the backgrounds towards high mass values, to put into evidence a peak from the \(T\) decay on a falling background, as shown in section 4.

### Cuts for the \(T\to tZ\) process

The peculiar signature with 3 charged leptons, a \(b\)-jet and some missing \(E_{T}\) together with the possibility to measure a mass resonance is exploited to reduce the \(S/B\) for this channel at the level of the unity.

The cuts used are:

* 3 leptons with \(P_{T}>\)40GeV
* Leading lepton with \(P_{T}>\) 100 GeV
* No other lepton with \(P_{T}>15\) GeV
* At least a pair of leptons has to satisfy the criterion \(|M_{ll}-M_{Z}|<10\)GeV
* One \(b\)-jet with \(P_{T}>30\) GeV
* Missing \(E_{T}>\)100GeV

The efficiency of each cut for the signal as well as for the background is summarized in table 4 together with the total number of events expected for 300fb\({}^{-1}\). It can be seen that the dominant contribution to the background is given by \(WZ\) production. A few plots to illustrate the effect of the cuts on the signal and on the background are in figure 2.

The total number of expected backgound events with this selection expected in 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) is 3.7, largely dominated by the \(WZ\) background.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|c|c} Cut & \(T\)(1TeV) & \(WZ\) & \(ZZ\) & \(tbZ\) & \(Zb\overline{b}\) & \(t\overline{t}\) \\ \hline Lepton \(P_{T}\) Cuts & 31.3\% & 1.2\% & 0.7\% & 6.6 \% & 6.6\(\cdot 10^{-7}\) & 7.8 \(\cdot 10^{-6}\) \\ \(|M_{ll}-M_{Z}|<\) 10GeV & 90.0 \% & 91.1\% & 79.0\% & 91\% & 90\% & 21\% \\ N(\(b\)-jets) = 1 & 44.0\% & 0.52\% & 0.83\% & 47\% & 40\% & 38\% \\ \(\not\!\!E_{\rm r}>\)100GeV & 53.2\% & 36.1\% & 10\% & 30.4\% & \(<\) 10\% & \(\simeq\) 16\% \\ \hline Total Eff. & 6.6\% & 2.1\(\cdot 10^{-5}\) & 0.41\(\cdot 10^{-5}\) & 0.8\% & \(<\)5\(\cdot 10^{-8}\) & \(\simeq\) 10\({}^{-7}\) \\ Events in 300fb\({}^{-1}\) & 12.7 & 2.3 & 0.2 & 0.4 & \(<\) 0.8 & \(\simeq\) 0.8 \\ \# of MC events after cuts & 332 & 52 & 8 & 912 & 0 & 1 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: _Efficiency for the analysis cuts. The efficiency for each cut is relative to the previous one._

### Cuts for the \(T\to Wb\) process

The \(T\to Wb\) decay has a branching ratio twice as large as the branching ratio for the \(T\to tZ\) decay and also the fraction of decays into a single lepton is 20% for the \(W\to l\nu\) as compared to about 1% for the \(tZ\to 3l\) decay. There will be much more events produced in the single lepton channel, however the background level is also higher and the signature is the same as that of a fourth generation quark produced through the same process.

A single lepton selection has been applied for isolating the \(T\to Wb\) decay. The cuts applied on the \(P_{T}\) of the final state objects (the charged lepton, the \(\not\!\!{E}_{\tau}\) and the \(b\)-jet) are not too hard, as we do not want to bias the invariant mass distribution of the backgrounds, to isolate the \(T\) particle.

In addition to \(P_{T}\) cuts, we require that there be no more than two jets above a 30 (or 50) GeV threshold. The signal is expected to have two final state jets, one from the \(b\)-quark, and one from a quark produced in association with the \(T\) particle, as the main production mechanism is via a \(W\) exchange in the \(t\)-channel. The requirement of a jet veto is critical to reject the \(t\overline{t}\) background, where at least two extra-jets are expected from the final state. Reconstruction of jets with a \(P_{T}\) as low as 30 GeV may be possible at the highest design luminosity of the LHC [13]. However, the effect of a higher jet threshold of 50 GeV is considered here, also in order to study the dependence of our results on the threshold.

Finally a cut on the invariant mass of the two final state jets is applied to reject \(t\overline{t}\) events where two jets are coming from the decay of the hadronic top, as their mass is expected to be lower than the top mass.

The list of cuts applied is:

* 1 charged leptons with \(P_{T}>\)100GeV;

Figure 2: _Effect of the cuts on the signal and on the background. On the left is is the \(P_{T}\) of the 3rd lepton in the event, on the right the missing transverse energy. The distributions are normalized to 1._* One \(b\)-jet with \(P_{T}>200\) GeV;
* No more than 2 Jets with \(P_{T}>30(50)\) GeV;
* Mass(j1,j2)\(>200\) GeV;
* Missing \(E_{T}>\)100GeV.

The distribution of some of the variables we are cutting on, are displayed in figure 3, and the efficiency of the cuts together with the event yield expected for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) is reported in table 5.

## 4 Invariant mass reconstruction and statistical significance

The invariant mass of the \(T\) particle can be reconstructed by grouping the decay particles and evaluating their invariant mass. No attempt was made to reconstruct the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino, as the mass resolution is dominated by the resolution on the \(P_{T}\) of hadronic jets, therefore the neutrino longitudinal momentum is neglected in the invariant mass calculation. The invariant mass reconstructed for a 1 TeV \(T\) particle is plotted in figure 4. It can be seen that in the case of the \(T\to tZ\) decay the background is almost negligible, while in the \(T\to Wb\) production a peak appears on a falling background.

Signal sample for masses in the range from 700 GeV to 2.5 TeV in 300 GeV intervals were generated to study the potential for discovery as a function of the \(T\) particle mass. As a criterion to evaluate the statistical significance, we consider that a discovery can be claimed if the ratio \(S/\sqrt{B}\) is above 5 and more than 10 signal events are observed. In the case of the \(T\to tZ\) it is clear that the 5-\(\sigma\) criterion is easily satisfied, so the discovery potential is driven by the 10 signal events requirements. From table 4 we can see that for

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|c} Cut & \(T(1\mathrm{TeV})\) & \(t\bar{t}\) & \(Wbb\) & single top & single top \\  & & & & \(t\)-channel & \(s\)-channel \\ \hline Lepton \(P_{T}\) Cuts & 66.7\% & 7.2\% & 1.0\% & 4.3\% & 9.9\% \\
1 \(b\)-jet, \(P_{T}>\)200 GeV & 43.1\% & 4.3\% & 5.8\% & 7.0\% & 13.3\% \\ Jet Veto & 69\% & 5.7\% & 61.8\% & 9.0\% & 47\% \\ \(M(j1,j2)>\)200 GeV & 92\% & 44\% & 64\% & 92\% & 84\% \\ \(\not\!\!{E_{\tau}}>\)100 GeV & 75\% & 31\% & 32.2\% & 30.6\% & 22.7\% \\ \hline Total Eff. & 13.8\% & 2.5\(\cdot 10^{-5}\) & 7.5\(\cdot 10^{-5}\) & 7.6\(\cdot 10^{-5}\) & 5.9\(\cdot 10^{-4}\) \\ Events in 300fb\({}^{-1}\) & 828 & 1240 & 1580 & 601 & 300 \\ \# of MC events after cuts & 690 & 230 & 718 & 107 & 59 \\ \hline \(800<M_{T}<1200\)GeV in 300fb\({}^{-1}\) & 749 & 440 & 570 & 106 & 97 \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: _Efficiency for the analysis cuts. The efficiency for each cut is relative to the previous one._\(\lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}\) and \(m_{T}\)=1 TeV a discovery can be made, as about 13 events would be measured. More generally, the discovery potential in the (\(m_{T}\), cross-section) plane is given in figure 5 (dark region). For \(\lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}\) a \(T\) particle can be discovered in the three lepton channel up to a mass of about 1.1 TeV.

In the case of the \(T\to Wb\) the signal over background ratio is lower than one, so the \(S/\sqrt{B}\) condition has to be satisfied. The events in a 200 GeV mass window around the peak are used to evaluate the ratio \(S/\sqrt{B}\). For the case used in table 5 a statistical significance of 21\(\sigma\) can be achieved with \(S/B=61\%\), assuming that the jet veto can be extended down to 30 GeV. For a jet veto of 50 GeV, the statistical significance is of 18\(\sigma\) and \(S/B\)=33% and the background is dominated by \(t\bar{t}\) events. The light color region of figure 5, shows that expected limit for discovery with this channel.

The three lepton channel is suitable for the discovery of the \(T\) particle for \(m_{T}<1100\) GeV for \(\lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}\) and for \(m_{T}<1.4\) TeV in the case \(\lambda_{1}=2\lambda_{2}\). The \(Wb\) channel can be used for discovery up to \(m_{T}=2\) TeV in the case \(\lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}\), and for masses in excess of 2.5 TeV for \(\lambda_{1}=2\lambda_{2}\). Also in the pessimistic situation with \(\lambda_{1}=1/2\lambda_{2}\) the \(Wb\) channel can be discovered for masses up to 1.2 TeV.

## 5 Conclusion

The ATLAS potential for the discovery of the \(T\) particle predicted by the little Higgs model was evaluated using a fast simulation of the detector. The decay channels into \(Wb\) and \(tZ\) were used to show that with a data sample of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) this particle can be detected for masses up to 2.5 TeV depending on the actual parameters of the model.
