HL-LHC projections for signal and background yield measurements of the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) when the Higgs boson is produced in association with \(t\) quarks, \(W\) or \(Z\) bosons

 ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

In this note the expected yields and the signal significances of Standard Model Higgs bosons produced in association with top quarks or \(Z\) or \(W\) bosons are estimated. The signature of the two photons consistent with the Higgs mass is used to discriminate the signal from the background. A data set corresponding to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) recorded by an upgraded ATLAS detector running at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with the high-luminosity LHC is assumed. Evidence for \(WH\) and \(ZH\) production is expected as well as an observation with a significance of \(8.2\sigma\) for the \(t\bar{t}H\) production mode. The projected signal strength precision is between 17% and 35%, depending on the production mode.

Introduction

After the decades-long search for the Higgs boson [1, 2, 3], a particle consistent with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson has been recently discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [4, 5]. A notable property of the SM Higgs boson is its large Yukawa coupling to top quarks. For this reason, the top quark is conjectured to play a special role in the process of electroweak symmetry breaking (EWSB) in extensions of the SM. The measurement of the top quark-Higgs boson Yukawa coupling is hence a key ingredient for understanding the EWSB. The coupling is indirectly probed by measurements of inclusive Higgs boson production [6], which is dominated by gluon-fusion production. In addition, it is probed in the decay of the Higgs boson to two photons, \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), since the decay width receives large contributions from loop diagrams involving top quarks. The production of top-antitop quark pairs (\(t\bar{t}\)) in association with a Higgs boson (\(t\bar{t}H\)), however, is directly sensitive to this coupling [6, 7, 8, 9]. The Higgs production associated to \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons is also important for precision measurements of the Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons.

Precise measurements in the Higgs sector are therefore a priority in the future programme of particle physics. The ATLAS collaboration presented a preliminary set of studies for the future LHC programme [10], included in the briefing book [11]. ATLAS studies of the projected precision of measurements of the Higgs boson production cross section times branching ratios and their interpretation in terms of Higgs boson couplings were prepared for the ECFA HL-LHC workshop [12].

This note reports the projected signal and background yields, signal significances and signal strength precision of the Standard Model Higgs boson produced in association with \(t\) quarks or \(Z\) or \(W\) bosons in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) decay channel with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data with the ATLAS detector running in the HL-LHC at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and an average instantaneous luminosity of \(\sim 5\times 10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), with the average number of collisions per bunch-crossing \(<\mu_{\rm pu}>=140\). The detector upgrade design for the high luminosity phase is not yet completely defined. Particle level quantities were modified by applying efficiency and resolution assumptions to physics objects. These are derived from full simulation samples of the baseline layouts for future upgrades of the ATLAS detector, with high pileup [13, 14]. This note provides an update using a more refined study of the \(t\bar{t}H\), \(WH\) and \(ZH\) prospects presented in Ref. [10], using the same assumptions as the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion results with \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) as in Ref. [12].

## 2 Data samples

The signal simulated samples contain events where a 125 GeV Higgs decays into two photons and is produced via gluon-gluon fusion (ggF), vector-boson fusion (VBF) and in association with a \(W\) boson (\(WH\)), a \(Z\) boson (\(ZH\)) or two top quarks (\(t\bar{t}H\)). Events with Higgs bosons produced via ggF and VBF are considered background to the signal of interest. The \(t\bar{t}H\), \(WH\) and \(ZH\) production samples were simulated with Pythia [15] using CTEQ6L1 parton distribution functions (PDFs) [16]. Higgs boson production via ggF and VBF was simulated with Powheg [17] interfaced to Pythia for showering and hadronisation, with CT10 PDFs [18].

Other background processes considered in this study are \(W\)/\(Z\)+jets, \(t\bar{t}\), and \(bb\gamma\gamma\). Background processes with no, one or two real photons in association with top quarks, \(W\) or \(Z\) bosons were generated with MadGraph. The \(bb\gamma\gamma\) background was simulated with MadGraph interfaced to Pythia for showering and hadronisation with CTEQ6L1 PDFs. The \(t\bar{t}\) background sample was simulated using MC@NLO and Herwig for event generation, Photos for corrections of photon radiation and Tauola for leptonic and semi-leptonic tau decays. Table 1 lists the simulated signal and background processes considered in this analysis. The size of the data samples and number of events are shown. This analysis does not make explicit use of \(b\)-tagging or missing transverse energy reconstruction. The underlying assumption is that the selection could eventually benefit from some loose \(b\)-tagging with sufficiently low mistag efficiency to suppress any jj\(\gamma\gamma\)+X continuum background not explicitly considered in this analysis.

## 3 Object selection, Trigger and Event reconstruction

The event analysis is performed at Monte Carlo (MC) generator level. The reconstruction properties and identification efficiencies expected with the HL-LHC conditions are parametrized as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(<\mu_{\mathrm{pu}}>\) using ATLAS full simulation event samples [13, 14]. As in current \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) analyses [19, 20], events are expected to be selected by a di-photon trigger. It is assumed that this will be loose enough with respect to offline identification to keep the trigger efficiency above 98% per photon coming from a Higgs decay, similar to that during the ATLAS Run 1 data taking. The di-photon mass resolution with \(<\mu_{\mathrm{pu}}>=140\) is also assumed to be the same as for Run 1. All requirements on the final state objects are applied to the parametrized properties.

As in the previous study [10], this analysis is based on the jet multiplicity present in the event and on the identification of one or two leptons in the final state, in addition to two isolated photons. Fully hadronic final states are not included.

### Photon, electron, muon and jet requirements

Two photons are required to be present in the final state to identify the di-photon Higgs decay. The selection of the di-photon events follows closely the inclusive selection developed for the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) search and observation in ATLAS at 8 TeV [19, 20]. One photon is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>40\) GeV and the other is required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>\)30 GeV. Both photons are required to be within \(|\eta|<\)2.37 and outside the barrel-to-endcap transition region of the detector \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\). The two photons are required to be isolated. The isolation requirement is implemented by searching for nearby generator-level jets reconstructed with the anti-kt algorithm using a cone of \(\Delta R\)=0.4. The photon is assumed isolated if within \(\Delta R<0.1\) there are no jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) greater than 15% of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the photon and if there are no other jets within \(\Delta R<0.4\) with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)\(>\)10 GeV.

\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|} \hline Simulated process & Process cross section & Events in sample \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Background processes} \\ \hline \(pp\to\)\(t\bar{t}\) & 977 pb & 14990000 \\ \(pp\to W(\to\ell\nu+\mathrm{jets}\) ) & 40.4 nb & 26863 \\ \(pp\to Z(\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}+\mathrm{jets}\) ) & 3.68 nb & 26725 \\ \(pp\to W(\to\ell\nu+\mathrm{jets}+\gamma\) ) & 93.5 pb & 37856 \\ \(pp\to Z(\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}+\mathrm{jets}+\gamma\) ) & 20.1 pb & 38611 \\ \(pp\to W(\to\ell\nu+\mathrm{jets}+\gamma\gamma\) ) & 17.0 fb & 99705 \\ \(pp\to Z(\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}+\mathrm{jets}+\gamma\gamma\) ) & 15.0 fb & 99644 \\ \(pp\to bb(\gamma\gamma)\) & 0.33 pb & 200000 \\ \hline \multicolumn{3}{|c|}{Higgs production mechanisms} \\ \hline gluon-gluon fusion & 49.9 pb & 50000 \\ vector boson fusion & 4.2 pb & 50000 \\ \(W\) associated production & 1.5 pb & 117452 \\ \(Z\) associated production & 0.88 pb & 117449 \\ top associated production & 0.611 pb & 116569 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Events are required to have at least one muon or electron in the final state. Leptons are required to have \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>\)20 GeV. Electrons are required to be within \(|\eta|<\)2.47 and, as for photons, to be outside the transition region \(1.37<|\eta|<1.52\). Muons are required to be within \(|\eta|<\)2.5. Leptons are considered isolated if there is no jet within \(\Delta R<\)0.15 with \(p_{\rm T}>\)35 GeV.

Events are categorised according to the number of jets present in the event in addition to the two photons. An \(\eta\) dependent \(p_{\rm T}\) cut is applied to the jet so as to give a rate of pile-up jets faking jets from hard interactions of \(\sim\)1% [11] (\(p_{\rm T}>41\) GeV for \(|\eta|<2.1\), \(p_{\rm T}>77\) GeV for \(2.1\leq|\eta|<2.8\), \(p_{\rm T}>74\) GeV for \(2.8\leq|\eta|<3.2\), \(p_{\rm T}>50\) GeV for \(3.2\leq|\eta|<3.5\)). Only jets with \(|\eta|<3.5\) are used in the analysis, since reconstruction parametrization of jets for higher \(|\eta|\) values are not available. Jets are not considered if they overlap within \(\Delta R\)=0.4 with electrons, muons and photons.

As mentioned in [13, 14] the transverse energy and position of the particles at the generator level are modified in order to take into account the detector resolution. To take into account the identification efficiency of the detector in reconstructing the event, a weight is computed as the product of the parametrized identification and trigger efficiencies of all the final state objects present in the analysis.

### Event categorization

Events where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a top quark pair are only considered when at least one of the \(W\) bosons from the top decays leptonically. These events are therefore expected to have at least two jets. Events with an associated vector boson, \(ZH\) and \(WH\), are not expected to have jets present in the event. In this analysis, the events are divided in four exclusive categories depending on both the number of leptons and the number of jets present in the final state. The first two categories, referred as ttH-1\(\ell\) and ttH-2\(\ell\), are requested to have at least two jets in the final state and respectively one and two additional leptons. Events with two same-flavour leptons with di-lepton invariant mass within \(|m_{\ell\ell}-m_{Z}|<15\) GeV are not included in the ttH-2\(\ell\) category. The WH category is defined by requiring events to have less than two jets and exactly one lepton in the final state. Finally, the ZH category is defined by events with exactly two same flavour leptons in the final state with the invariant mass of the di-lepton system close to the mass of the \(Z\) boson: \(|m_{\ell\ell}-m_{Z}|<15\) GeV. Events with more than two leptons in the final state are not used in the analysis. Table 2 shows a schematic representation of event categorization.

The distributions of the number of jets in the ttH-1\(\ell\), ttH-2\(\ell\) and WH categories are shown in Figure 1 where the requirement on the number of jets was removed. The ttH-1\(\ell\) and the WH category fully overlap, and hence are shown in the same plot. In both cases, \(t\bar{t}H\) dominates with two or more jets while \(Z\)+jets and \(W\)+jets background and \(WH\) signal usually have no jets with \(p_{\rm T}\) larger than the selection cut in the event. The distribution of the jet multiplicity from \(t\bar{t}\) background in the ttH-1\(\ell\) and ttH-2\(\ell\) samples are very similar due the tight \(p_{\rm T}\) requirement applied on the jets. Nevertheless in ttH-1\(\ell\) it is slightly shifted to higher values than that of the ttH-2\(\ell\) category as expected. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the invariant mass of the two same flavour leptons reconstructed in the event. Events shown here either belong to the ZH or the ttH-2\(\ell\) categories or have less than two jets and contain two same flavour leptons

## 4 Analysis and results

The analysis consists of obtaining the signal and background yields in each of the four event categories from a fit of a signal+background model to the di-photon invariant mass distributions simulated for \(<\mu_{\mathrm{pu}}>=140\) and an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Although the equivalent integrated luminosity of the simulated signal samples used for this analysis is several times larger than the 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) assumed for the current analysis, the size of the background samples used is small, making the signal+background fits unreliable and unstable. For this reason, a method based on toy generated signal+background mass distributions was used in order to perform fits and yield computations as follows. For each non-Higgs background sample and for each category, an exponential function is fitted to the di-photon mass distribution. The original background distributions are then replaced by their corresponding exponential-fitted representation. The choice of an exponential parameterization has been used in the 8 TeV ATLAS analyses [19, 20] and it is valid under the assumption of a falling \(m_{\gamma\gamma}\) distribution for all relevant background processes. Di-photon mass distributions of MC Higgs samples are added to the sum of all the exponential background representations in each category.

Figure 2: Invariant mass distribution of the two same flavour leptons present in the event.

These final sum of non-Higgs background representations plus MC Higgs samples are used as PDFs to generate toy-MC events used in this analysis.

A signal+background model is then fitted to the toy-MC generated events. The background model used is an exponential function and the signal model is a Gaussian with mean set to 125 GeV and width set to the value expected from MC simulation for each of the categories. Signal and background yields are obtained by integrating the signal and background fits in the mass range 122 GeV \(<m_{\gamma\gamma}<\) 128 GeV. Signal yields are also computed from MC expectations, integrating the signal-only di-photon mass distribution in the same mass range and are in good agreement with those from the fit.

The systematic uncertainty on the parametrization of the background was estimated as the difference in the number of background events under the signal peak when fitting a high statistics (300 ab\({}^{-1}\) equivalent) toy-MC background-only distribution with an order-4 and order-6 Bernstein polynomial and the nominal exponential function.

The resulting invariant mass distribution of the two isolated photons and the corresponding signal+background model fit is shown in Figure 3 for all four categories in the analysis. The background subtracted mass distribution is also shown. The signal and background yields obtained from the fits are

shown in Table 3 along with signal yields obtained from MC expectations for comparison. Uncertainty due to the parametrization of the background is also shown. This is a small fraction of the total uncertainty of the background which is dominated by statistical uncertainty. Signal yields in this table not only include signal of Higgs boson from the aimed production channel, but also those produced in all other production channels, considered as background.

The composition of signal and background for each of the four analysis categories is shown in Table 4. Each column represents an analysis category and each row represents the fraction of a given background sample in the total background yield and the fraction of a given production mode in the total signal yield. Background composition is computed as the fraction of the total background composed by \(t\bar{t}\), \(W\)+jets, \(Z\)+jets and \(bb\gamma\gamma\) events. The signal composition is computed as fraction of the total signal composed by \(t\bar{t}H\), \(WH\), \(ZH\), ggF and VBF production mechanisms. The \(W\)+jets and \(Z\)+jets backgrounds are dominant in the ttH-1\(\ell\) category, considering all the events where one of the leptons of the \(Z\) boson is not identified. The \(Z\)+jets background dominates all the other three analysis categories.

Tables 5 and 6 show the relative uncertainties on the signal strength and expected significance per production mode obtained when using di-photon decay events from each category defined in this note ttH-1\(\ell\), ttH-2\(\ell\), WH and ZH and those previously defined in [12] (0-jet, 1-jet and 2-jets VBF-like) profiling the other production modes.
