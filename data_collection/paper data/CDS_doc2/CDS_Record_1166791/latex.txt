This note describes the methods developed for the measurement of the properties of minimum bias events during low luminosity running using the ATLAS detector. These methods aim to reconstruct the inclusive pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of charged particles with \(p_{T}>150\) MeV produced from 14 TeV pp collisions. The triggers used to record minimum bias events are described and their acceptances evaluated. An analysis to measure the inclusive distributions is presented and the systematic uncertainties discussed. Finally, there is an overview of future physics studies with minimum bias samples.

Introduction

This note focuses on how the ATLAS detector [1] can be used to measure the central pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of charged particles produced in inelastic proton-proton (pp) collisions during early running at the LHC. Measuring the characteristics of these collisions allows an understanding of the physics behind these processes to be developed, particularly their energy dependence. The minimum bias events allow the soft-part of the underlying event in high-\(p_{T}\) collisions to be characterised. Studies of inclusive particle distributions in minimum bias events in pp collisions are important to provide the baseline for measurements in heavy-ion collisions, such as allowing differences in the number of particles to be attributed to QCD effects rather than the simple scaling of the number of nucleons. Finally these interactions will be a major background during low luminosity running (\(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) and high luminosity running (\(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)), where the average number of such interactions per beam crossing is \(\sim 2\) and \(\sim 18\), respectively.

The total proton-proton cross-section can be divided into elastic and inelastic components, and the inelastic component can be further divided into: non-diffractive, single diffractive and double diffractive components [2]. The total cross-section (\(\sigma_{tot}\)) can then be written as:

\[\sigma_{tot}=\sigma_{elas}+\sigma_{sd}+\sigma_{dd}+\sigma_{nd}\]

where these cross-sections are elastic (\(\sigma_{elas}\)), single diffractive (\(\sigma_{sd}\)), double diffractive (\(\sigma_{dd}\)) and non-diffractive (\(\sigma_{nd}\)), respectively. The cross-sections for the inelastic subprocesses determined using PYTHIA [3], which was used to generate the event samples for this study, are given in Table 1. For comparison, the cross-sections predicted by PHOJET [4] are also shown in Table 1. The PHOJET predictions include central diffraction, however this hard proton-pomeron interaction only contributes to the cross-section at the few per cent level. As this is not simulated in PYTHIA, it was not considered further in this note.

The acceptance of inelastic events is defined by the trigger, which is usually known as a minimum bias trigger. It is designed to avoid bias in the sample, such as selecting high-\(p_{T}\) events by triggering on high-\(p_{T}\) objects. However, some bias is usually introduced due to effects such as the geometrical acceptance of or minimum energy thresholds in the trigger detector. It is therefore not unusual to find different definitions for minimum bias events in the literature. Historically, the minimum bias triggering used in hadron collider experiments [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] often used triggers based on forward-backward coincidences that favoured the detection of non-single diffractive inelastic events (NSD), i.e. \(\sigma_{nsd}=\sigma_{tot}-\sigma_{elas}-\sigma_{sd}\). Thus, NSD events have often been classified as'minimum bias events'. In this note, results from simulated events selected using the minimum bias triggers are presented. These results have been corrected for detector reconstruction and acceptance effects. The results for the non-single diffractive sample are also presented to allow comparison with previous results from hadron-collider experiments. However, this requires correcting for the trigger acceptance for each of inelastic processes, which depends on the physics model used to generate the different processes.

Minimum bias interactions have previously been studied at a range of different energies at the CERN ISR [5], CERN SppS [6, 7, 8] and Fermilab's Tevatron [9, 10, 11] and RHIC colliders. Based on these results, Monte Carlo models have been tuned to generate predictions for LHC multiplicities [12]. Figure 1 shows a comparison of model predictions for the central charged particle density in NSD p\(\bar{\mathrm{p}}\) events for a wide range of centre-of-mass energies (\(\sqrt{s}\)). The data points shown are corrected for detector and trigger effects and efficiencies back to the particle level. Figure 1 compares predictions generated with two different tunings of PYTHIA [3] (ATLAS and CDF tune-A [12]) with the central charged particle density generated with PHOJET [4, 13]. It is clear from this figure that there is a large uncertainty in the predicted central particle density of non-single diffractive interactions at the LHCenergy even though the models have been tuned to agree with data at lower energies. This uncertainty arises because the energy dependence in a variety of different models for low-\(p_{T}\) hadronic processes is not well understood. Measuring the central particle density at the LHC will thus be crucial to determining the energy dependence of the central particle density and constraining models of inelastic events.

This paper is organized as follows: In section 2 we briefly describe the experimental setup and the trigger strategies that have been developed to accept inelastic collisions with minimum bias. The analysis procedure, corrections, as well as the systematic effects involved in this study are discussed in section 3. Section 4 presents an overview of future work planned to be done with ATLAS minimum bias measurements. Finally, in section 5 we present our conclusions.

### Characteristics of inelastic events

The pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) and transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) distributions of charged particles generated using PYTHIA [3], with the parameter set defined in Ref. [14] and PHOJET [13, 4] with default parameters are shown in Figs. 2(a) and 2(b). These distributions correspond to non-diffractive, single- and double-diffractive inelastic pp interactions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, respectively. They clearly show large uncertainties in model predictions for the LHC and that the events are dominated by low-\(p_{T}\) particles with the highest densities found in the central region \(|\eta|<3.0\). Much of this central region is covered by the ATLAS inner detector. The charged particle distributions will be reconstructed from tracks which are measured by the inner detector for \(|\eta|<2.5\), with \(p_{T}\) greater than \(150\) MeV.

### Backgrounds

The main backgrounds in minimum bias events, particularly during early running, will be beam-gas collisions within the beampipe over the length of ATLAS, and beam-halo from interactions in the tertiary collimators in the accelerator. These backgrounds can provide spurious triggers that must be removed from the inelastic event sample to prevent distortion of its characteristics. During early low luminosity running a large fraction of bunch crossings will have no pp interaction. Using a trigger based only on bunch-crossings would result in a large number of empty events, which only contain detector noise, being recorded. Therefore, the trigger must be able to reject such events in order to optimise the use of the trigger bandwidth. In this paper we will present results which include discussions on beam-gas events and empty events but not on beam-halo.

## 2 Simulation and experimental setup

The samples of single-, double-, and non-diffractive inelastic events used in this study were generated with PYTHIA version 6.403 [3]. The PYTHIA event generator was configured according to an underlying event tuning fit [14] from previous experiments and is expected to provide a reasonable description of the non-diffractive part of minimum bias events.

### The ATLAS inner detector

The pseudorapidity and transverse momentum distributions of charged particles are measured using the ATLAS inner detector. The inner detector is described in detail elsewhere [1]. It consists of, in order of increasing radius, a silicon pixel system, a silicon microstrip system (SCT) and a gas-based transition radiation detector (TRT). The inner detector is mounted inside a solenoid magnet which provides a 2 T magnetic field.

The inner detector sub-detectors are designed as independent but also complementary systems. The pixels cover radii of 50.5 mm-149.6 mm, the SCT covers 299 mm-560 mm and the TRT covers 563 mm-1066 mm. The precision tracking detectors (pixel and microstrip) cover \(|\eta|<2.5\) and are divided into barrel (\(|\eta|<1.4\)) and endcaps (\(1.4<|\eta|<2.5\)).

The ATLAS inner detector will provide hermetic and robust pattern recognition, excellent momentum resolution and both primary and secondary vertex measurements for charged tracks above a \(p_{T}\) threshold, which is nominally 500 MeV but can be as low as 100 MeV within \(|\eta|<2.5\). The nominal \(p_{T}\)-cut of 500 MeV corresponds to tracks traversing the full inner detector, however as discussed in section 1.1 a measurement of the properties of minimum bias events requires a \(p_{T}\)-cut of \(\leq\) 200 MeV. A \(p_{T}\)-cut of 150 MeV, used in this paper, corresponds to tracks that traverse the precision Si tracker (pixels and SCT) allowing low-\(p_{T}\) tracks to be well reconstructed.

### The minimum bias trigger scintillators

The Minimum Bias Trigger Scintillators (MBTS) [15] are mounted on the inner surface of the liquid argon endcap cryostats and cover a pseudorapidity range of \(2.12<|\eta|<3.85\). The MBTS is constructed from 2 cm polystyrene-based scintillator counters. Each side of the MBTS is made up of 16 counters each of which is split into two regions of equal pseudorapidity (\(2.12<|\eta|<2.83\), \(2.83<|\eta|<3.85\)) and covering \(\frac{\pi}{4}\) in azimuth. The MBTS is read out through the tile calorimeter electronics providing a fast L1 signal, which is discriminated above a voltage threshold, relative to the bunch-crossing signal.

Minimum bias trigger scenarios

A minimum bias trigger should select inelastic collisions with as little bias as possible, precluding the use of the standard high-\(p_{T}\) triggers. Ideally, the L1 random trigger [16] with beam pickup would be used to accept events with zero bias, and inelastic collisions would be selected offline. However, during early running when the luminosity is expected to be \(<10^{30}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), the random trigger will be very inefficient since the probability of an interaction during a bunch crossing is \(<1\%\). Therefore, validation of the L1 random trigger is required in the high-level-trigger (HLT). The use of tracking in the HLT to validate the random trigger and a dedicated L1 trigger based on the minimum bias trigger scintillators (MBTS) has been studied. A minimum bias trigger stream consisting of the random trigger, track trigger and the MBTS is shown in Figure. 3. The random-based track trigger and the MBTS triggers are discussed in sections 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. In addition, the L1 MBTS could be used in conjunction with the pixel and SCT spacepoints reconstructed at L2 and the Event Filter (EF) track trigger. However, this was not studied in this note.

As the luminosity increases from \(\sim 10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) to \(10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and higher values, the mean number of interactions per bunch crossing will be around 1. The random trigger will then record interactions for each crossing without requiring further triggers at L2 or EF to reject empty bunch events. This will allow a zero bias sample to be efficiently accepted by ATLAS using the random trigger.

For the purposes of this note, a luminosity of \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) with a bunch spacing of 75 ns has been assumed. The rate of inelastic events under those conditions is 792 kHz, and the mean number of events per bunch crossing is 0.06.

Trigger efficiencies were calculated using around \(10^{5}\) events of simulated hydrogen beam-gas, single diffractive, double diffractive, non-diffractive and empty events. Each of these simulated samples were reconstructed and passed through the trigger logic and the trigger efficiency was then calculated from the number of events satisfying the trigger logic.

### Random-based track trigger

The selection of minimum bias events by a track trigger is performed by the high-level trigger. The aim is to reject empty bunch and beam-gas events. After the random event selection at L1, the L2 trigger rejects empty events by requiring a minimum number of spacepoints in the pixel and SCT

Figure 3: Minimum bias trigger slice.

detector. The trigger efficiency curves for different types of events (ddiff: double diffractive, ndiff: non-diffractive and sdiff: single diffractive) are shown in Figure 4. The efficiency of empty bunch events as a function of spacepoints clearly shows that a modest constraint on either the number of pixel or SCT spacepoints rejects events containing only random noise. The thresholds for the number of pixel and SCT spacepoints were determined from the requirement to have a signal to background for non-diffractive to empty bunch events of 100:1. Given that the beam conditions assumed in this paper correspond to a probability of a pp non-diffractive inelastic interaction of 0.05, this corresponds to constraining the efficiency of empty bunch events to be less than \(5\times 10^{-4}\). This requires setting the threshold on the number of spacepoints to be 12 and 3 in the pixel and SCT respectively.

While the spacepoint (SP) trigger reduces the number of beam-gas events accepted, the rate can be further reduced by requiring the presence of reconstructed tracks within a small \(z\)-region around the nominal interaction point. A full track reconstruction scan with a minimum \(p_{T}\) of 200 MeV is carried out in the EF on the events that pass the SP trigger. These tracks are then used to select events using the cuts defined in Table 2. The trigger efficiency is plotted with respect to the number of reconstructed tracks in Figure. 5. The empty events are rejected by the cut on the number of pixel and SCT spacepoints resulting in an efficiency of zero.

### Minimum bias triggers using the MBTS

Two simple MBTS L1 trigger strategies were considered for minimum bias event selection: MBTS_1_1 and MBTS_2. MBTS_1_1 is defined as at least one MBTS counter above threshold on each side, where

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline Track parameter & 2 Trigger cut \\ \hline Number of tracks & \(\geq\) 2 \\ Track z0 & \(<\) 200 mm \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Track cuts for EF track trigger.

Figure 4: Trigger efficiency as a function of the number of pixel spacepoints (a) and the number of SCT spacepoints (b).

the threshold of 40 mV was chosen from measurements of cosmic commissioning data. MBTS_2 is defined as two or more MBTS counters above threshold anywhere in the MBTS system. The trigger efficiencies as a function of MBTS counter threshold for inelastic non-diffractive, double-diffractive, single-diffractive, beam-gas and empty bunch events are given in Fig. 6.

### Trigger efficiency

A summary of the trigger efficiencies for the track-based and MBTS triggers are given in Table 3. The efficiency of diffractive events is around half of that of non-diffractive events. This is primarily due to the low particle multiplicity in diffractive events and because the triggers cover the central region and

Figure 6: MBTS L1 trigger threshold scans for the two trigger configurations: (a) MBTS_1_1 (b) and MBTS_2.

are therefore only sensitive to a fraction of the diffractive cross-section corresponding to high mass diffractive states.

The acceptances for the different processes i.e. the efficiencies weighted by the fraction of the inelastic cross-section are given in table 4. This shows that due to lower efficiencies and smaller cross-sections the acceptance of diffractive events is significantly suppressed. The acceptance of the proposed minimum bias triggers is around 85-92% and this will consist of around 80% of non-diffractive events and roughly equal numbers of single and double diffractive events.

## 4 Analysis

The goal of the analysis is to reconstruct the number of primary charged particles per unit of pseudorapidity and per unit of transverse momentum for inelastic pp interactions taken with the minimum bias trigger. Primary particles are defined as particles produced in the pp collision, but excluding secondary particles from weak decays of strange hadrons or from electromagnetic or hadronic interactions in the detector material.

A sample of \(\sim\)150,000 inelastic events, with ND, SD and DD events mixed in the proportion given by the PYTHIA cross-sections, was reconstructed and used in this study (MB sample). A typical non-diffractive event contains around 45 reconstructed tracks of which 37 are from primary particles and 8 are from secondary particles. The efficiencies and corrections were derived from half the sample and used in the analysis of the other half of the sample.

### Event selection

Two selection criteria are applied to the set of reconstructed events: the event must be triggered by the minimum bias trigger and it must contain at least one reconstructed vertex. The sample of inelastic events selected by the MBTS_2 trigger, described in Section 3.2, was used for this analysis. No beam-gas or pileup events were included in the sample studied here. An additional criterion should be added to exclude events with multiple pp interactions in a bunch-crossing but this was not included

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|r|r|r|r|} \hline  & MBTS\_1\_1 & MBTS\_2 & SP & SP \& EF Tracks \\ \hline Non-diffractive & 69\% & 70\% & 70\% & 70\% \\ Double-diffractive & 7\% & 10\% & 8\% & 8\% \\ Single-diffractive & 8\% & 12\% & 10\% & 10\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}
Table 3: MBTS and random-track trigger efficiencies.

in this analysis as the samples of simulated data used for this study contained events with a single pp interaction in a bunch-crossing.

### Track selection

Tracks were reconstructed using tracking with the minimum \(p_{T}\) set to 100 MeV rather than the default 500 MeV. To avoid threshold effects, tracks with \(p_{T}>150\) MeV were used in the analysis. The relative \(p_{T}\)-resolution, \(\sigma(\frac{1}{p_{T}})p_{T}\), was found to be around 1.5% for \(|\eta|<0.8\) and 4.3% for \(|\eta|>1.6\).

Cuts on the measured track parameters were used to select a set of well reconstructed tracks for the analysis.

These cuts are listed in Table 5. The requirement of a hit in the inner pixel layer,the b-layer, removes a sizable portion of fake tracks and tracks associated to secondary particles since they frequently do not leave a hit in the first layer of the pixel detector. The cut on the number of pixel and SCT hits is a standard track scoring cut applied during reconstruction and is listed here only for completeness. The values of the cuts were chosen by fitting each of the distributions with a gaussian and cutting at \(\sim 3\sigma\).

The track-to-vertex cut is the selection that most effectively cuts away tracks from secondary particles while accepting tracks from primaries. It is made by cutting on the distance of closest approach to the nearest reconstructed vertex, normalized by the error. The normalized distance to the vertex is defined as

\[\Delta R \equiv \sqrt{\left(\frac{\Delta d_{0}}{\sigma_{d_{0}}}\right)^{2}+ \left(\frac{\Delta z_{0}}{\sigma_{z_{0}}}\right)^{2}}, \tag{1}\]

where \(\Delta d_{0}/\sigma_{d_{0}}\) and \(\Delta z_{0}/\sigma_{z_{0}}\) are the normalized distances in the transverse and longitudinal directions, respectively. The number of \(\sigma\) to the vertex as a function of \(\Delta R\) (for a two-dimensional gaussian) is given by

\[N_{\sigma} = \sqrt{2}\mathrm{erf}^{-1}(1-e^{-\Delta R^{2}/2}). \tag{2}\]

Note that the above formula assumes no correlations between the resolutions in the transverse and longitudinal direction.

To determine the effects of the cuts and evaluate efficiencies and acceptances, the reconstructed tracks are matched to the generated primary and secondary particles. The track that has the highest

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|l|} \hline  & No. of b-layer hits \(\geq 1\) \\ Quality cuts & No. of Silicon hits \(\geq 5\) \\ \hline  & \(|\sigma_{d_{0}}|<1.6\) mm \\  & \(|\sigma_{z_{0}}|<6.0\) mm \\ Resolution cuts & \(|\sigma_{\phi}|<0.03\) \\  & \(|\sigma_{\theta}|<0.015\) \\  & \(|\sigma_{q/p_{T}}|<0.0003\ (\mathrm{\ Ge\kern-1.0ptV})^{-1}\) \\ \hline Track-to-vertex cut & \(N_{\sigma}<3\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

For more information on the tracking Event Data Model (EDM) see [17].

percentage of hits that overlap with the trajectory of a generated particle is matched to that generated particle. A track is well matched to a particle if greater than 50% of its hits overlap with the generated particle's trajectory. A primary track is one matched to a primary particle and similarly a secondary track is one matched to a secondary particle. If a track is not matched to any generated particle, it is classified as a fake.

Table 6 shows the influence of the track cuts on the reconstructed sample. Each row shows the percentage of tracks that did not pass each of the specified cuts. Note that a single track can fail several cuts and therefore give counts in several rows. Three of the rows show the percentage of tracks that fail any of the quality cuts ('Quality'), any of the resolution cuts ('Resolution') and any of the quality or resolution cuts ('Q \(||\) R'). The strongest and most effective cut is the track-to-vertex cut, which rejects about 88% of the secondaries. The second last row shows the percentage of reconstructed tracks that are outside the pseudorapidity and \(p_{T}\) range used in the analysis (\(|\eta|>2.5\), \(p_{T}<150\) MeV).

### Procedure & corrections

The \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\) and \(dN_{ch}/dp_{T}\) distributions are obtained by starting with the measured number of selected tracks in selected events and applying the following three corrections:

* Track-to-particle correction
* Vertex reconstruction correction
* Trigger bias correction

The first correction accounts for the difference between the number of measured tracks and the number of primary charged particles. This is essentially a correction for the inner detector acceptance and efficiency of the tracking software [18]. The second correction takes into account the vertex reconstruction efficiency and corrects for events that have no reconstructed vertex. These two corrections account for detector dependent effects and produce the minimum bias sample, in which the data have been corrected for detector reconstruction and acceptance but have not been corrected for the trigger acceptance.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Cut & \% Cut All & \% Cut Primary tracks & \% Cut Secondary tracks \\ \hline b-layer hit & 15.9 & 8.5 & 46.8 \\ \(\mathrm{cov}_{d0}\) & 11.5 & 6.0 & 34.2 \\ \(\mathrm{cov}_{z0}\) & 9.4 & 5.0 & 27.4 \\ \(\mathrm{cov}_{\phi}\) & 8.9 & 5.1 & 24.3 \\ \(\mathrm{cov}_{\theta}\) & 4.9 & 4.2 & 8.2 \\ \(\mathrm{cov}_{q/p_{T}}\) & 6.4 & 4.3 & 14.9 \\ Quality & 15.9 & 8.5 & 46.8 \\ Resolution & 16.7 & 10.9 & 40.4 \\ Q \(||\) R & 24.6 & 15.6 & 62.1 \\ Track-to-Vtx & 30.7 & 16.9 & 87.8 \\ \(\eta\ ||\)\(p_{T}\) & 1.2 & 1.3 & 0.9 \\ \hline Total & 38.6 & 24.6 & 96.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: Fraction of tracks cut away by the selection cuts.

The trigger bias correction depends both on the detector simulation and on the physics model used in the event generator to simulate inelastic pp interactions. Different corrections for the trigger can be applied to correct the measured distributions back to different physics processes, i.e. inelastic, non-single-diffractive or non-diffractive interactions.

The track-to-particle correction is applied only at the track level. The vertex correction and the trigger bias correction are applied at the track and event level. The track-level vertex and trigger bias corrections are needed to compensate for any bias on the measured track distribution due to vertex and trigger requirements. All track-level corrections are determined as a function of pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)), \(p_{T}\) and the \(z\)-position of the collision vertex, \(v_{z}\). The event level corrections are determined as a function of \(v_{z}\) and the number of reconstructed tracks in the event.

The corrections are 3-D and 2-D histograms but the principal corrections shown in the figures below are plotted as projections of \(p_{T}\)\(\eta\)\(z\)-position or the number of reconstructed tracks as appropriate for clarity.

#### 4.3.1 Track-to-particle correction

The number of selected reconstructed tracks differs slightly from the number of primary charged particles due to a number of different effects: the acceptance of the detector, the detector and track reconstruction efficiency, the contribution from secondaries and fakes, and the acceptance of the track selection cuts. The track-to-particle correction takes all these effects into account and is calculated as

\[C_{trk}(\eta,v_{z},p_{T}) \equiv \frac{\text{No. of primary charged particles}}{\text{No. of selected reconstructed tracks}}. \tag{3}\]

The numerator and denominator are calculated for the same events taken through the full detector simulation and reconstruction.

Figure 7 shows the projection of the 3-dimensional track-to-particle correction onto the \(\eta\) and \(p_{T}\) axes. The correction is significant and changes rapidly with \(p_{T}\) below 200 MeV where the reconstruction efficiency is lower due to a lower number of hits on a track and the effects of material and multiple scattering. Above 200 MeV the correction is small and has a small dependence on \(p_{T}\).

#### 4.3.2 Vertex reconstruction correction

The vertex correction takes into account the bias introduced by events that are not counted because their vertex was not found by the vertex reconstruction algorithm. The event-level correction is calculated as a function of \(v_{z}\) and number of reconstructed tracks in the event:

\[\bar{C}_{vtx}(v_{z},N) \equiv \frac{\text{No. of triggered events}}{\text{No. of triggered events with }\geq 1\text{ reconstructed vertex}}. \tag{4}\]

The track-level vertex correction is calculated as a function of \(\eta\), \(v_{z}\) and \(p_{T}\):

\[C_{vtx}(\eta,v_{z},p_{T}) \equiv \frac{\text{No. of tracks in all triggered events}}{\text{No. of tracks in triggered events with }\geq 1\text{ reconstructed vertex}}. \tag{5}\]

Although the vertex correction is essentially a detector correction, some model dependence is present since only triggered collisions are taken into account to compute the correction factors. However, the use of only triggered events has the advantage that the correction can be computed directly from the data, without relying on any simulation. Once data are available it will also be possible to compare the properties of the triggered events with no reconstructed vertex to the corresponding events in the simulation. This may help minimize and better estimate any systematic uncertainties.

Figure 8 shows the event-level vertex reconstruction correction as a function of the number of reconstructed tracks, \(N\), and vertex \(z\)-position. A vertex can be defined using a single well reconstructed track. As the number of tracks increases, the correction approaches unity. For events with \(N>10\), a vertex is always found and the correction is no longer required.

Figure 9 shows projections of the 3-dimensional track-level vertex correction onto the \(v_{z}\) and \(p_{T}\) axes. These corrections are found to be at the level of a few percent.

#### 4.3.3 Trigger bias correction

The trigger bias correction accounts for the difference between the MB sample selected by the minimum bias trigger and the physics process of interest. This correction depends on the trigger detector simulation and on the models of the pp interactions used in the event generator. Therefore, this correction is dependent on the relative cross-sections of the inelastic processes used and on the modelling of particle production for the different inelastic processes.

After an initial model-independent measurement is made, the MB sample, the trigger bias correction can be used to obtain distributions for other samples of interest: non-diffractive (ND), non-single diffractive (NSD) or inelastic (INEL) collisions. Each of these samples corresponds to a different trigger correction and each correction can be applied to yield the final distributions for the different collision samples. In general the correction from MB to NSD collisions is the smallest since these two event samples are almost identical, while the correction from MB to INEL is on the order of 1.2 (integrated over \(N\) and \(v_{z}\)).

The trigger bias correction is determined on event level as a function of \(v_{z}\) and multiplicity, defined

as in the vertex correction:

\[\tilde{C}_{trig}(v_{z},N) \equiv \frac{\text{No. of interactions in sample of interest}}{\text{No. of triggered events}}, \tag{6}\]

and on track-level as a function of \(\eta\), \(v_{z}\) and \(p_{T}\):

\[C_{trig}(\eta,v_{z},p_{T}) \equiv \frac{\text{No. of tracks in sample of interest}}{\text{No. of tracks in triggered events}}. \tag{7}\]

In this analysis it is assumed that there is only one interaction per event since the events have been simulated in this way. This will need to be verified in the real data for any events with more than one reconstructed vertex by looking at the multiplicity of each of the vertices and the distance between the vertices. As in the vertex correction, all tracks are counted since the track-to-vertex distance is undefined for events with no reconstructed vertex.

Figure 10 shows the event-level trigger bias correction for the NSD sample as a function of multiplicity and vertex \(z\)-position. Using the MBTS_2 trigger, the correction is only important for \(N<25\); for higher multiplicities the correction factor is not needed. It is largest for \(N<5\) which are principally diffractive events that have a lower trigger efficiency relative to the non-diffractive events as discussed in section 3.

Figure 11 shows projections of the 3-dimensional track-level trigger bias correction for the NSD sample to two of the three 2-dimensional planes and to the \(v_{z}\) and \(p_{T}\) axes.

### Corrected distributions

An \(\eta\)-\(v_{z}\)-\(p_{T}\) (3-D) histogram is filled for each track in each event and weighted with the values of the track-level corrections described above. A \(v_{z}\)-\(N\) (2-D) histogram is also filled for each event and

weighted with the values of the event-level corrections. This histogram is needed to provide the proper normalization factor for the analysis.

After filling the histograms, a vertex range is chosen and the \(v_{z}\) variable is integrated out. In the case of \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\), the \(p_{T}\) variable is integrated for \(p_{T}>150\) MeV; in the case of \(dN_{ch}/dp_{T}\), the \(\eta\) variable is integrated over \(-2.5<\eta<2.5\). Each \(\eta\)-bin or \(p_{T}\)-bin is then divided by the total number of events, calculated by integrating the weighted event distribution histogram over \(N\) and \(v_{z}\). Finally, the distribution is normalized by the inverse width of the bins. No correction was made for the effect of the \(p_{T}\) cutoff in the reconstruction. However, the stability of the results will be tested by varying the \(p_{T}\) cutoff in data.

The distributions are presented for the sample events accepted by the minimum bias trigger. For this analysis MBTS_2 is used, and are labelled as MB. The MB distributions have only been corrected for the acceptance and efficiencies associated with reconstructing tracks and vertices. To obtain the NSD distributions to allow comparisons with other results, the MB distributions are corrected for the trigger bias.

The correction procedure can be expressed mathematically for one bin, corresponding to a certain region of phase space, in the following way. The number of particles \(P\) and number of interactions \(I\) are calculated as:

\[P(\eta,v_{z},p_{T}) = \sum_{eventstracks}(C_{trk}(\eta,v_{z},p_{T})\cdot C_{trk}(\eta,v_ {z},p_{T})\cdot C_{trig}(\eta,v_{z},p_{T})), \tag{8}\] \[I(v_{z},N) = \sum_{events}(\tilde{C}_{vtx}(v_{z},N)\cdot\tilde{C}_{trig}(v_{z},N)). \tag{9}\]

Tracks are weighted by the track-to-particle correction \(C_{trk}(\eta,v_{z},p_{T})\), by the track-level vertex correction \(C_{vtx}(\eta,v_{z},p_{T})\) and the track-level trigger bias correction \(C_{trig}(\eta,v_{z},p_{T})\). Events are weighted by the event-level vertex correction \(\tilde{C}_{vtx}(v_{z},N)\) and the event-level trigger bias correction \(\tilde{C}_{trig}(v_{z},N)\).

Figure 11: The track-level trigger bias correction for the NSD sample as a function of (a) \(v_{z}\) and (b) \(p_{T}\).

For a given vertex range \([V_{1},V_{2}]\) the \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\) and \(dN_{ch}/dp_{T}\) are then calculated as:

\[\left.\frac{dN_{ch}}{d\eta}\right|_{\eta=\eta^{\prime}} = \frac{\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}}\int P(\eta^{\prime},v_{z},p_{T})dp_{T} dv_{z}}{\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}}\int I(v_{z},N)dNdv_{z}}, \tag{10}\] \[\left.\frac{dN_{ch}}{dp_{T}}\right|_{p_{T}=p_{T}^{\prime}} = \frac{\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}}\int P(\eta,v_{z},p_{T}^{\prime})d\eta dv _{z}}{\int_{V_{1}}^{V_{2}}\int I(v_{z},N)dNdv_{z}}. \tag{11}\]

To exercise the analysis chain, the complete reconstructed sample was divided in half: one part was used to calculate the corrections and the other used as 'data' input to the analysis.

Figures 12 and 13 show the corrected pseudorapidity distribution (\(p_{T}>150\) MeV) and the corrected transverse momentum spectrum (\(|\eta|<2.5\)) for the MB and NSD event samples. Statistical errors on the corrected distributions are shown. The aim was to achieve statistical errors on the corrections of less than 2% per bin. The errors are mostly negligible since sufficient statistics were used to determine the correction factor. Data in regions where small statistical errors could not be achieved (i.e. near the edges of the acceptance) are not included in the analysis.

### Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties have been estimated by changing the parameters in the generation, reconstruction or analysis and then re-evaluating the corrections and applying them to the analysis input sample. Although many of the systematic uncertainties are correlated, the different effects are studied here independently. The systematic uncertainties investigated include:

* Track selection: Based on the estimated track resolutions (\(\sigma\)) for their distance from the vertex of the interaction, \(d_{0}\), tracks with \(d_{0}>3\sigma\) are removed from the track sample. The error associated with this cut was estimated by varying the cut value by \(\pm 0.5\sigma\) and observing the change in the number of accepted tracks. A mis-estimate of \(\pm 0.5\sigma\) leads to a change in the number of accepted tracks of less than 2%.
* Secondaries: Before track selection cuts are applied, the number of tracks originating from secondaries is about 25% of the number of tracks originating from primaries. After the track selection the total number of accepted secondary tracks is about 2.2% of the number of the accepted tracks. The error on the number of secondaries was estimated by changing the number of secondaries in the reconstructed sample by \(\pm 50\%\). The total number of accepted secondary tracks was found to change by 1.1%. The effect is strongest in the low-\(p_{T}\) region and vanishes only for \(p_{T}\)\(>\)5 GeV. The systematic uncertainty was therefore estimated to be 1.5%.
* Vertex reconstruction bias: Since the \(z\)-position of the reconstructed vertex is integrated out, it is possible that a bias from the reconstruction of the vertex could introduce a systematic effect on the measurement. Bias due to the vertex reconstructed was evaluated by repeating the \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\) analysis using the generated \(v_{z}\) instead of the reconstructed \(v_{z}\). The observed difference was found to be 0.1%.
* Misalignment: The systematic effect from misalignment was estimated by re-running the reconstruction with a different geometry that corresponded to a misaligned and distorted detector, and comparing the \(dN_{ch}/d\eta\) produced with that produced for a detector that is ideally aligned. The misaligned geometry was misaligned both globally and locally. However, the local misalignments had been corrected for using the alignment procedure.

at the level of 5-6% across the barrel and forward regions. This is the exepected level that can achieved with cosmics and early data. A systematic uncertainty of 6% was attributed to misalignment.
* Beam-gas interactions: The presence of background events coming from beam-gas would result in additional systematics on the measurement. The rate of beam-gas interactions is highly dependent on the particular beam conditions during startup such as the number of protons per bunch and the beam current. Studies by the LHC group have estimated the rate of beam-gas collisions within ATLAS to be 100 Hz [19]. Assuming a pp collision rate during early running of 8\(\times 10^{5}\) Hz this corresponds to approximately 1 beam-gas event per 8000 pp events. Preliminary studies with simulated beam-gas events have also shown that only a very small fraction (\(<\)1%) of beam-gas events passed the vertex reconstruction requirement. Therefore the effect of beam-gas events is expected to be small. The systematic uncertainty due to beam-gas events was estimated to be \(\sim\) 1%.
* Particle composition: The track-to-particle correction is calculated from events generated with PYTHIA [14]. Although \(\pi^{\pm}\), \(K^{\pm}\), and \(p^{\pm}\) compose over 98% of the charged particle multiplicity in these events, the efficiency for detecting each of these is considerably different for \(p_{T}<\) 500 MeV. This model dependent effect introduces an additional systematic error on the measurement since relative abundances in PYTHIA could differ from reality. Relative abundances of charged pions, kaons and protons and anti-protons were enhanced and reduced by \(\pm\)50% to estimate the systematic uncertainty due to variations in the particle composition. The systematic uncertainty obtained by this method is estimated to be around 2%. This is highly dependent on the low-\(p_{T}\) cut used in track reconstruction.
* Relative process frequency: The trigger bias and vertex reconstruction corrections are calculated from a sample of inelastic events where the relative cross-sections are as predicted by PYTHIA [3]. Since the trigger and vertex reconstruction efficiencies are different for each of the inelastic components (non-diffractive, single diffractive, and double-diffractive), these corrections are dependent on the relative cross sections of the different components. The relative cross sections between non-diffractive, single-diffractive and double-diffractive components were enhanced and reduced to estimate the systematic due to the uncertainty from the PYTHIA event generator. The corrections have been calculated by changing the diffractive cross sections by \(\pm\)50% of the PYTHIA prediction, i.e. 7.1 mb \(<\sigma_{SD}<\) 21.4 mb and 5.1 mb \(<\sigma_{DD}<\) 15.3 mb, which, as can be seen in Table 1, covers the difference in the predicted relative cross sections between PYTHIA and PHOJET. Changing the diffractive cross sections by \(\pm\)50% changes the result of the analysis by about 4% on the final NSD sample. For the minimum bias sample in which no trigger bias correction is applied, this systematic error is approximately zero.

A summary of the systematic uncertainties is given in Table 7 along with the step in the full chain at which they are introduced. The uncertainties in the track selection, vertex reconstruction bias and mis-estimate of secondaries are dominated by the low-\(p_{T}\) tracks (\(<\)500 MeV). Any uncertainties at the generator level are due to uncertainties in predictions of physics models at LHC-energy and are unavoidable in the final analysis. However, the principal error in the reconstruction arises from alignment of the inner detector. The estimate of 6% is for initial running and is likely to improve.

## 5 Future work

### Work required for first data

A number of issues have arisen during the work for this note that need to be studied further. Many of these studies are already in progress and should be completed before the first pp collisions from the LHC are recorded. The main topics currently under investigation are:

* _Studies with other Monte Carlo generators_: The studies of pp interactions in this note have been carried out using PYTHIA [3]. The biases introduced by the trigger will certainly depend on the particular physics models employed by PYTHIA. The generator PHOJET [4, 13] is being used to simulate samples of LHC inelastic pp collisions (non-diffractive, single- and double-diffractive). The physics studies discussed previously in the analysis section are going to be repeated with PHOJET samples and the results compared with those shown in this note. Comparing the results from analyses in different samples will provide us indications on the systematic uncertainties due to different physics models.
* _Vertexing_: During initial running at low luminosities, there will still be periods where there will be more than one event per bunch crossing. It is therefore important to be confident that an event contains only one interaction by identifying events with a single vertex. Further work is required to look at vertex reconstruction with low levels of additional events to evaluate how well events with several vertices can be reconstructed.
* _MBTS readout_: The MBTS L1 trigger readout is currently being upgraded as part of the tile calorimeter refurbishment. As a part of this refurbishment the 3-in-1 cards connected to the MBTS readout are being switched from low gain to high gain. This modification means that the signal to noise should be 5-6 times better than the values used in Section 3.2. In addition to the L1 improvements, the MBTS will be readout at L2 to allow verification of the L1trigger decision using the precision readout of the Tile Calorimeter electronics. Work is ongoing to implement software to match these requirements. Once the software has been validated, the MBTS L1and L2 trigger performance will be reevaluated.

\begin{tabular}{|l|l|c|} \hline Name & Level & Estimated Uncertainty \\ \hline Track selection cuts & Analysis & 2\% \\ Mis-estimate of secondaries & Analysis & 1.5\% \\ Vertex reconstruction bias & Reconstruction & 0.1\% \\ Misalignment & Reconstruction & 6\% \\ Beam-gas and pileup & Offline Trigger & 1\% \\ Particle composition & Generation/Simulation & 2\% \\ Diffractive cross sections (NSD sample) & Generation & 4\% \\ \hline Total & & 8\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 7: Summary of the various systematic uncertainties and the level at which they are introduced. The total systematic uncertainty assumes each of the individual uncertainties are independent.

* _Beam-gas and beam halo estimate from commissioning runs_: Recent efforts to produce more accurate predictions for beam gas rates will allow a re-run of studies on how best to optimize the MBTS and the track-trigger to reduce this background in the measured minimum bias sample. For both cases, strategies on how to estimate the rates of beam-gas and halo events from data during commissioning runs with a single proton beam are beginning to be discussed.
* _ATLAS Beam Conditions Monitor_ The Beam Conditions Monitor [20] is designed to distinguish collisions from background through time-of-flight measurement and can improve our understanding of beam-gas and halo rates.

### Physics studies beyond first data

Following the first physics studies with minimum bias data a series of applications can be foreseen. Among them we would highlight:

* _Retuning Monte Carlo generators_: LHC predictions for minimum bias events generated with tuned MC generators PYTHIA and PHOJET indicate that although these tuned models give comparable descriptions of lower energy data, they disagree typically by \(\sim 30\%\) for minimum bias multiplicity distributions [12]. Measuring the global properties of minimum bias interactions as presented in this paper will provide enough information to revisit the generator predictions and retune event generators to describe interactions at the LHC energy. This will not only allow us to distinguish which physics model and assumptions better agree with the data, but will also allow the reassessment of systematic uncertainties in various channels.
* _Multiparton interactions_: Charged particle multiplicity distributions [21] have been widely used as important tools for studying multiple particle production in inelastic hadronic events [5, 6, 10, 11]. They are particularly useful when displayed in terms of multiplicity scaled variables known as KNO variables [21]. Plotted as a function of KNO variables, the charged multiplicity distributions provide a clearer display of fluctuations seen for both very low (less than half of the average multiplicity) or very high multiplicity (more than the double the average) events. The rise of the high multiplicity tail in these distributions has been interpreted as an effect caused by multiparton interactions [10, 11] and the LHC measurement of this effect will contribute greatly to a better understanding of the underlying physics in inelastic collisions.
* _Contribution to the measurement of the total cross section_: A measurement of the total inelastic rate by combining the NSD analysis with a measurement of single diffractive cross section by the ALFA detector should be possible. Simultaneously measuring the elastic t-spectrum, which can then be extrapolated to \(t\to 0\), will enable us to determine the total cross section (\(\sigma_{tot}\)) in a luminosity-independent way or to calibrate the absolute luminosity in \(\sigma_{tot}\)-independent way, using the optical theorem.
* _Baseline for heavy-ion studies_: A measurement of the particle yield from a single minimum bias event can and will be used to cross-check components and assumptions made by models for heavy-ion collisions which will then be tuned according to the LHC data. This procedure is expected to help in generating more reliable predictions for the heavy-ion runs.

Conclusions

We have investigated methods for measuring the characteristics of inelastic collisions with the ATLAS detector during early LHC running. The main goal of our study was to reconstruct the normalised central pseudorapidity (\(\frac{1}{N_{ex}}\frac{dN}{d\eta}\)) and transverse momentum (\(\frac{1}{N_{ex}}\frac{dN}{d\eta_{T}}\)) distributions of charged primaries in pp interactions selected by a minimum bias trigger. Triggering strategies for minimum bias event selection have been developed and an analysis to determine the charged particle distributions were presented.

Aiming at selecting inelastic collisions with as little bias as possible, two scenarios were proposed for triggering: a random-based track trigger and using the minimum bias trigger scintillators. The random-based track trigger combines random event selection at L1 with the use of information from the ID in the HLT; spacepoints from the pixel detector and the SCT at L2 and tracks reconstructed in the EF. Minimum bias selection with the MBTS is performed by recording events that pass L1 MBTS hit requirements. It has been shown that both triggers are highly efficient at selecting non-diffractive inelastic samples. However, the acceptance of the diffractive component is highly suppressed relative to the non-diffractive component, and the acceptance of the single-diffractive sample is similar to that of the double-diffractive sample. This means that the ATLAS minimum bias triggers do not select a NSD sample as previous experiments have and therefore model dependent corrections will be required to compare ATLAS measurements to results from previous experiments.

Results were presented for two samples: the MB sample, which has only been corrected for detector effects, and the NSD sample where the MB sample has been further corrected for the trigger acceptance, which is model dependent. The analysis was performed on a sample of \(\sim 75,000\) events, corresponding to a luminosity of \(10^{-6}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The uncertainty on \(\frac{1}{N_{ex}}\frac{dN}{d\eta}\) for both samples is dominated by the systematic uncertainty from alignment and there is an additional uncertainty on the NSD sample due to the model dependence of the relative cross-sections. The systematic uncertainty on \(\frac{1}{N_{ex}}\frac{dN}{d\eta}\) for the MB sample was estimated to be 6% and 8% for the NSD sample. This will be sufficient to distinguish between different models of minimum bias events.
