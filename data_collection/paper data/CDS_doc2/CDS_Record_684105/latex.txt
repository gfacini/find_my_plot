The hadronic \(\tau\) decay of a heavy charged Higgs, \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\), is considered in ATLAS. In the mass region \(m_{H^{\pm}}>m_{t}\), the most relevant decay channels of the charged Higgs are \(H^{\pm}\to tb\) and \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\). Whereas the former suffers from large irreducible backgrounds, the latter offers a relatively clean environment with the appropriate cuts. In addition, a further suppression of the backgrounds is achieved by making use of the polarization of the \(\tau\) lepton.

Introduction

In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), the Higgs sector consists of five physical particles, two of which are charged, \(H^{\pm}\)[1]. Some of the most promising decay channels of the charged Higgs have been used to study its discovery potential in ATLAS: below the top-quark mass, the \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) has been studied and the signal appears as an excess of \(\tau\) leptons [2]. The channel \(H^{\pm}\to Wh^{0}\) is relevant in a very small area of the MSSM parameter space, thus offering only a marginal discovery potential in ATLAS. However, in the singlet extension to MSSM, _i.e._, NMSSM, the discovery potential could extend to a more significant range of the parameter space [3][4]. Above the top-quark mass, the channel \(H^{\pm}\to tb\) has been studied: discovery is possible for low (\(<3\)) and for high (\(>25\)) \(\tan\beta\) up to \(m_{H^{\pm}}\sim 400\) GeV; the diminishing signal rate, in addition to the irreducible backgrounds, prevents the detection of a significant signal in the mass range \(m_{H^{\pm}}>400\) GeV [5].

The study of the channel \(H^{\pm}\to\tau\nu\) for \(m_{H^{\pm}}>m_{t}\) is presented in the current paper. Above the top-quark mass and at high \(\tan\beta\), the \(tb\) and the \(\tau\nu\) channels are the dominant decay channels of the charged Higgs while at low \(\tan\beta\), the \(tb\) is almost exclusively the lone decay channel. Thus, the present study of the \(\tau\nu\) channel is carried out in the region \(m_{H^{\pm}}>m_{t}\) and \(\tan\beta>10\). Unlike the \(tb\) decay mode which suffers from large irreducible backgrounds, the \(\tau\nu\) channel could be free of such backgrounds, thereby extending the discovery potential beyond that achieved in the \(tb\) channel, especially at large \(\tan\beta\). Further, an additional suppression of the backgrounds might be possible by taking advantage of the distinctive polarization of the \(\tau\) lepton.

In the following, we present the details of the current analysis which is carried out in PYTHIA5.7 [6] -- including two-loop radiative corrections to MSSM Higgs masses and couplings -- and ATLFAST [7]. A SUSY spectrum heavier than the charged Higgs is assumed with no stop mixing.

## 2 Analysis

The events are generated in PYTHIA5.7 using the process \(gb\to tH^{\pm}\). The associated top quark is required to decay hadronically, \(t\to jjb\). The charged Higgs decays into the \(\tau\) lepton, \(H^{\pm}\rightarrow\tau\nu\), and the hadronic decays of the \(\tau\) are considered. It is believed that the hadronic decay of the \(\tau\) carries a better imprint of the \(\tau\) polarization which can help suppress the backgrounds further [8]. In ATLFAST, hadronic \(\tau\)-jet labelling is performed by requiring hard hadronic \(\tau\) decay products within the tracking range: \(p_{T}^{\mbox{had}}>10\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\); in addition, the hadronic decay products must carry a significant fraction of the \(\tau\)-jet energy within a jet cone:

\[\frac{p_{T}^{\mbox{had}}}{p_{T}^{\tau\mbox{-jet}}} > 80\%, \tag{1}\]

\[\Delta\,R_{\mbox{\tiny($\tau$-jet,had)}} < 0.1. \tag{2}\]

A \(\tau\)-jet tagging efficiency of 30% (this corresponds to a jet rejection factor of \(\sim 400\) at \(p_{T}=30\) GeV [9]) and a b-tagging efficiency of 60% are assumed for an integrated luminosity 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). This study assumes a multi-jet trigger in addition to a high level \(\tau\) trigger. The backgrounds considered are QCD, W+jets, single top production W\(tb\) (derived from ISUB=31 in PYTHIA5.7), and \(t\bar{t}\), with one \(W\to jj\) and the other \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu\). The rates for the signal and for the backgrounds are shown in Table 1 as a function of \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) and \(\tan\beta\). The rates for the signal are also shown in Figure 1 as a function of \(m_{A}\) and for various values of \(\tan\beta\). The events are selected as follows(the efficiencies of these selections are shown in Table 2):

**(a)**: Search for one hadronic \(\tau\) jet with \(p_{T}^{\tau}>30\) GeV and \(|\eta^{\tau}|\leq 2.5\), at least three non \(\tau\) jets with \(p_{T}^{\rm jet}>30\) GeV. One of these jets must be a b-tagged jet with \(|\eta^{b}|<2.5\). Further, we apply a b-jet veto by requiring only a single b-jet with \(|\eta|\leq 2.0\) and \(p_{T}>50\) GeV.
**(b)**: The W from the associated top quark is reconstructed and the candidates satisfying \(|m_{jj}-m_{W}|\leq 25\) GeV are retained (and their four-momenta are renormalized to the W mass) for the reconstruction of the top quark: this is done by minimizing the variable \(\chi^{2}=(m_{jjb}-m_{t})^{2}\). We take \(m_{W}=80.14\) GeV and \(m_{t}=175\) GeV. Subsequently, the events satisfying \(|m_{jjb}-m_{t}|<25\) GeV are \(gb\to tH^{\pm}\), \(H^{\pm}\rightarrow\tau\nu\), \(t\to jjb\)

 retained for further analysis. The reconstructions of the W and the associated top quark are shown in Figure 2.
**(c)**: To further reject the backgrounds, we raise the cut on \(p_{T}^{\tau}\), _i.e._, \(p_{T}^{\tau}>100\) GeV. To satisfy this \(p_{T}^{\tau}\) cut, the \(\tau\) jet from the backgrounds needs a large \(p_{T}\) boost from the W boson, \(W\rightarrow\tau\nu\)[8]. This will result in a smaller opening angle, \(\Delta\phi\), between the decay products \(\tau\nu\). Here, \(\Delta\phi\) is the azimuthal opening angle between the \(\tau\) jet and the missing transverse momenta. However, in the signal \(H^{\pm}\rightarrow\tau\nu\), the \(\tau\) jet will require little or no boost at all to satisfy this high \(p_{T}^{\tau}\) cut. This explains the backward peak in the \(\Delta\phi\) distribution for the signal as shown in Figure 3. Similarly, the missing transverse momentum \(\not\!\!p_{T}\) distribution is harder for the signal (see Figure 2). The transverse mass

\[m_{T}=\sqrt{2p_{T}^{\tau}\not\!\!p_{T}\left[1-\cos(\Delta\phi)\right]} \tag{3}\]

combines both the effects from the opening angle \(\Delta\phi\) and from the transverse missing momentum \(\not\!\!p_{T}\) thereby providing a good discrimination between the signal and the background events as shown in Figure 3. In addition, the transverse mass \(m_{T}\) is bound from above by \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) for the signal and by \(m_{W}\) for the backgrounds. However, due to the experimental resolution of \(E_{t}^{\rm miss}\), the \(m_{T}\) distribution for the backgrounds (Figure 3) shows a "leak" into the signal region.
**(d)**: To optimize the signal-to-background ratios and the signal significances, we apply a cut on the missing transverse momentum: \(\not\!\!p_{T}>100\) GeV. Requiring such a high threshold on \(\not\!\!p_{T}\) suppresses completely the QCD jet background as shown in Table 2. We cut also on the azimuthal opening angle: \(\Delta\phi>0.5\) rad. The results for the signal and the backgrounds are shown in Figure 4.

\(gb\to tH^{\pm}\), \(H^{\pm}\rightarrow\tau\nu\), \(t\to jjb\)

**(e)**: A final cut of \(\Delta\phi>1.0\) rad is applied and the results are shown in Figure 5 and used for the calculation of the signal-to-background ratios and the signal significances shown in Table 3.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline \hline \(\tan\beta\) & 15 & 30 & 40 & 45 & 25 & 35 & 60 & 50 \\ \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) (GeV) & 180 & 200 & 250 & 300 & 350 & 400 & 450 & 500 \\ \hline Signal events & 9.43 & 42.7 & 52.9 & 61.8 & 15.9 & 26.2 & 51.6 & 29.1 \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & 10.3 & 10.3 & 10.3 & 10.3 & 10.3 & 10.3 & 10.3 & 10.3 \\ W\(tb\) & 4.24 & 4.24 & 4.24 & 4.24 & 4.24 & 4.24 & 4.24 & 4.24 \\ W+jets & 0.82 & 0.82 & 0.82 & 0.82 & 0.82 & 0.82 & 0.82 \\ \hline Total background & 15.4 & 15.4 & 15.4 & 15.4 & 15.4 & 15.4 & 15.4 \\ \hline \(S/B\) & 0.61 & 2.78 & 3.44 & 4.02 & 1.03 & 1.71 & 3.36 & 1.89 \\ \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & 2.41 & 10.9 & 13.5 & 15.8 & 4.05 & 6.69 & 13.2 & 7.41 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: The expected signal-to-background ratios and significances calculated after cut **(e)** for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). The backgrounds are relatively small; in fact, it is the size of the signal itself that limits the range of the discovery potential.

## 3 Polarization Effects

The polarization of the \(\tau\) could result in a harder \(\tau\) jet for the signal relative to the backgrounds in the case of 1-prong decay into \(\pi\) or longitudinal vector mesons; the transverse vector meson contributions dilute the polarization effects and must be eliminated [8][11][12]. The transverse contributions could be suppressed without having to identify the individual mesonic contributors to the 1-prong decay [8]. One way to do this is to require that over 80% of the \(\tau\)-jet energy is carried by the charged track,

\[\frac{p_{\pi^{\pm}}}{p_{\tau\text{-jet}}}>80\%. \tag{4}\]

Alternatively, one can demand a hard distribution in \(\Delta p_{T}\) which is the difference in the momenta of the charged track and the accompanying neutral pion(s) [8][13],

\[\Delta p_{T}=|p_{T}^{\pi^{\pm}}-p_{T}^{\pi^{0}}|. \tag{5}\]

The simulation of the polarized \(\tau\) decays has been included (for the signal, and the \(t\bar{t}\), W\(tb\) and W+jets backgrounds) into PYTHIA through TAUOLA [14], and all the hadronic \(\tau\) decays have been considered. In Table 4, we show the effect due to the \(\tau\) polarization. The table shows a reduction in the backgrounds and an enhancement in the signal leading to better signal-to-background ratios and significances but the shapes of the distributions remain similar to that of the unpolarized case (Figures 2-4). The final transverse mass distributions after cut **(e)** are shown in Figure 6, to be compared to the unpolarized case of Figure 5.

We considered two points below the \(H^{\pm}\to tb\) threshold (\(m_{H^{\pm}}=180\) GeV) and the results are summarized in Table 5. These results, together with the data of Table 4, are used to obtain the \(5\sigma-\)discovery contour of Figure 7.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:8]

We study the effect of the \(\tau\) polarization further by applying the requirement (4) after the cut **(e)** defined above.

Furthermore, we demand that the charged tracks in too few statistics.

which satisfy this condition must also pass the following test

\[|\eta^{\pi^{\pm}}| < 2.5, \tag{6}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c} \hline \hline  & cut **(e)** & cut **(f)** \\ \hline Background events & 6.7 & 0.3 \\ \hline \hline \multicolumn{3}{c}{\(\tan\beta=30\), \(m_{H^{\pm}}=200\) GeV} \\ \hline Signal events & 46.3 & 12.5 \\ \(S/B\) & 6.9 & 48.8 \\ \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & 17.9 & 24.6 \\ \hline \hline \multicolumn{3}{c}{\(\tan\beta=60\), \(m_{H^{\pm}}=450\) GeV} \\ \hline Signal events & 66.9 & 18.3 \\ \(S/B\) & 10.0 & 71.5 \\ \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & 25.8 & 36.1 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 6: The implications of the additional cut **(f)** that we apply to study further the effects of the \(\tau\) polarization. This cut improves the signal-to-background ratios and the signal significances. However, there are significant drops in the selection efficiencies by factors of 3.7 to 22 in both the signal and the backgrounds, resulting in too few statistics.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c|c} \hline \hline \(\tan\beta\) & 20 & 18 \\ \(m_{H^{\pm}}\) (GeV) & 128 & 162 \\ \hline Signal events & 5.3 & 13.6 \\ \hline Total background & 6.7 & 6.7 \\ \hline \(S/B\) & 0.8 & 2.0 \\ \(S/\sqrt{B}\) & 2.0 & 5.2 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: The expected signal-to-background ratios and significances calculated after cut **(e)** for the two points considered below \(m_{H^{\pm}}=180\) GeV, and for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). This data are also used in the calculation of the \(5\sigma-\)discovery contour.

\[\Delta\,R_{\mbox{\scriptsize($\tau$-jet},\pi^{\pm})} < 0.1. \tag{7}\]

Henceforth, we refer to these additional cuts as cut **(f)**. If the spectrum contains more than one charged pion, we use the candidate with the highest \(p_{T}\) for the cut **(f)**. Table 6 shows the results of this cut **(f)**. We note that irrespective of where the requirements **(f)** are applied in our chain of event selection described in section 2 -- see cuts **(a)**-**(e)** -- they lead to improvements in the signal-to-background ratios and the signal significances, as shown in Table 6, although the number of accepted events is reduced by factors of 3.7 to 22 in both the signal and the backgrounds. Further reductions in the selection efficiencies are expected when one restricts the requirements **(f)** so as to retain only 1-prong events. Thus, the suppression of the transverse vector meson contributions to the 1-prong decays results in the enhancement of the signal-to-background ratios and the signal significances but with significant reductions in the selection efficiencies.

## 4 Conclusions

We have studied the ATLAS discovery potential of the charged Higgs through the decay \(H^{\pm}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) above the top-quark mass. For \(m_{H^{\pm}}<m_{t}\), this channel was previously studied for ATLAS and the signal appears as an excess of \(\tau\) leptons over SM predictions. In the region \(m_{H^{\pm}}>m_{t}\), the \(\tau\nu\) and the \(tb\) decay channels constitute the main decay modes of the charged Higgs. At low \(\tan\beta\), the \(tb\) mode is the only major decay channel of the charged Higgs while at high \(\tan\beta\), the branching fraction into the \(\tau\nu\) channel can be significant. Previous studies of the \(tb\) channel show large irreducible backgrounds which are absent in the \(\tau\nu\) channel.

This study is carried out for \(m_{H^{\pm}}>m_{t}\) and \(\tan\beta>10\). The charged Higgs is produced in association with a top quark according to \(gb\to tH^{\pm}\). We consider the hadronic decay of the associated top quark, \(t\to jjb\) and the hadronic decay of the \(\tau\) lepton originating from the charged Higgs. This study assumes a multi-jet trigger together with a high level \(\tau\) trigger. By imposing a sufficiently high threshold on the \(p_{T}\) of the \(\tau\) jet, the background events satisfying this cut need a large boost from the W boson. This results in a small azimuthal opening angle between the \(\tau\) jet and the missing momentum. In contrast, such a boost is not required from the \(H^{\pm}\) for the signal events, leading to a backward peak in the azimuthal opening angle. Furthermore, the missing momentum is harder for the signal. The difference between signal and background distributions in the azimuthal angle and the missing momentum increases with increasing \(m_{H^{\pm}}\). These effects are well cumulated in the transverse mass which provides a good discrimination between the signal and the backgrounds -- the full invariant mass is not reconstructed in this case because of the neutrino in the final state. For the backgrounds, the transverse mass is kinematically constrained to be smaller than \(m_{W}\) but for the signal, the transverse mass is bound from above by \(m_{H^{\pm}}\). However, because of the experimental resolution of \(E_{t}^{\rm miss}\), some leakage of the background events into the signal region is observed. The backgrounds in this channel are relatively small; significances upwards of \(5\sigma\) can be achieved for \(m_{H^{\pm}}>m_{t}\) and \(\tan\beta>10\), for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\). In fact, the range of discovery potential is solely limited by the signal size itself.

It has been argued that further improvement in the signal-to-background ratios and in the signal significances is still possible by making use of the \(\tau\) polarization effects. We have included the \(\tau\) polarization into PYTHIA through the TAUOLA simulation code and considered all the hadronic decays of the \(\tau\) lepton. Indeed, the present study shows that such an improvement can be statistically significant, and that it is not necessary to restrict oneself to just the 1-prong decays to see the effects of the \(\tau\) polarization.
