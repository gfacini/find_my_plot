###### Abstract

The calibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter, using the electrons resulting from \(Z^{0}\) decay, is studied. The simulated rates of useful electrons, in the barrel, are of the order of 4 Hz at a luminosity \({\cal L}=10^{34}\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). An algorithm is presented for calibrating each cell using the \(Z^{0}\) invariant mass. This method is discussed in comparison with the usual E/p method and, by analyzing the backgrounds, it is shown to work even without any tracking information. The sharing of the signal deposited in the hit cell and its neighbors is shown to degrade the calibration accuracy in both methods. The simulation of the calibration process to achieve 1% accuracy leads to a number of 50 to 150 electrons by cell, depending on the energy sharing considered. The calibration of the 30000 cells in the barrel of the electromagnetic calorimeter is thus feasible within 5 to 13 days respectively.

## 1 Introduction

The use of an electromagnetic calorimeter with a very accurate response is fundamental in the study of many important physics processes. In particular the detection of low mass Higgs, predicted by the Standard Model to be a very narrow peak, through the channels \(H\to Z\,Z^{\star}\to 4e^{\pm}\) or \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), will require the use of an electromagnetic calorimeter with a constant term in the energy resolution [1] of less than 1%. The processes of calibration and monitoring are of crucial importance in constructing and maintaining the very precise ATLAS calorimeter with a huge number of cells, in the order of 30000 in the barrel, for a typical granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.025\), which is supposed to last for more than 10 years in a high radiation level environment.

Several mechanisms can be proposed for calibrating and monitoring the EM calorimeter which are more or less specific to each technique. Basically they can either consist of injecting a known signal at a certain step of the conversion processes and measuring its output or they measure the calorimeter intrinsic response using a test setup.

Events obtained during the experiment can also be used as an alternative or complement to the above methods, since it is desirable to have as much redundancy as possible. Theiruse to calibrate and monitor the calorimeter presents a series of advantages, e.g. the use of \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}\,e^{-}\) events, does not require any special setup and measures the performance of the calorimeter directly for processes of the same nature as the ones for which it is intended for, without relying on any assumption on the signal processes. These events allow both an absolute calibration of the calorimeter and the monitoring of the changes due to ageing just by analyzing the data taken in the experiment.

In this work we study the use of the invariant mass peak - in the \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}\,e^{-}\) process -, which is ideal for the calibration procedure because it is produced at reasonable rates with low background, the resulting electrons are easy to trigger at high luminosity and have a rather uniform \((\eta,\phi)\) distribution. The present simulation investigates if the invariant mass method can be applied if the calorimeter information is the only available, which would make it very attractive in the absence of tracking information.

An alternative way to perform the calibration of the electromagnetic calorimeter involves the \(E/p\) ratio between the tracking measurement in the magnetic field of the electron momentum and the corresponding energy measured in the calorimeter. This has already been used [2] for individual cell calibration together with an overall factor obtained by computing the \(Z^{0}\) invariant mass peak. This calibration method is not limited by the natural width of the \(Z^{0}\) but depends upon tracking identification and the resolution of the momentum measurement. Bremsstrahlung is also important, losing energy to the radiated photon which is still collected in the calorimeter but is not included in the tracking momentum measurement. On the other side the \(E/p\) method only involves few neighbor cells to contain the EM shower when the use of the invariant mass establishes correlations among all cells leading to huge matrices which are numerically difficult to handle.

## 2 Physics simulation

The PYTHIA Monte-Carlo (version 5.6) was used in this work to simulate the \(Z^{0}\) production at LHC using the Drell-Yan process [3]. This generator puts the emphasis on parton showers generating initial and final state radiation, but does not include explicitly QCD corrections. Due to particle showering, the processes with final state \(Z^{0}\)+jet together with the Drell-Yan lead to double counting and are therefore not included.

One could also consider the QCD corrections by using a "matrix elements" [4] type of Monte-Carlo that would include \({\cal O}(\alpha_{S})\) or even \({\cal O}(\alpha_{S}^{2})\) corrections. The full \({\cal O}(\alpha_{S}^{2})\) calculation of Ref. [5] showed a significant cancellation among the different second order contributions leading to a K-factor of \(K\approx 1.1\).

More meaningful differences arise from the use of different structure functions which involve an extrapolation to very small \(x\) that can not be solved by constraining to data obtained at much lower energies. According to the discussion in Ref. [6] we have chosen the MT (set 1) structure function as one compatible with new data. The values obtained in Ref. [5] for several structure functions are used to specify reasonable limits for the computed rates.

### Physical rates and distributions

For the \(Z^{0}\) production at LHC, without any cuts on the produced leptons, we have obtained a total \(\sigma(Z^{0})\):BR= 1.15 nb that corresponds to a rate of 11.5 Hz at luminosity \({\cal L}=10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\), which can vary from 6 Hz to 13 Hz according to the parametrization of the structure functions used.

The \(Z^{0}\) boson \(p_{t}\) and \(Y\) distributions are given in Fig. 1. One can see that the \(Z^{0}\)'s are generated at relatively low \(p_{t}\). In all distributions presented here, the histograms, obtained from a sample of 15000 generated events, were normalized to the number of events per effective year (\(10^{7}\)s) of running at a luminosity \({\cal L}=10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

In Fig. 2 we present the histograms corresponding to the resulting \(e^{+}e^{-}\) distributions. The electron \(\min(P_{t}^{1},P_{t}^{2})\) distribution, also shown in Fig. 2, is peaked at 40 GeV showing that a cut of \(p_{t}>20\) GeV will have a yield large acceptance.

The natural \(Z^{0}\) resonance is reproduced by a relativistic Breit-Wigner function,

\[f_{R}(m_{ee};m_{Z},\Gamma_{Z})=N\,\frac{m_{ee}^{2}}{(m_{ee}^{2}-M_{Z^{0}}^{2})^ {2}+\Gamma_{Z^{0}}^{2}m_{ee}^{4}/M_{Z^{0}}^{2}} \tag{1}\]

where the probability distribution is a function of the invariant mass \(m_{ee}\) with the normalization constant \(N\) and \(M_{Z^{0}},\Gamma_{Z^{0}}\) are the \(Z^{0}\) mass and natural width. This is presented, in

Figure 1: _The \(Z^{0}\)\(p_{t}\) and \(Y\) distributions._Figure 2: _The \(p_{t}\) and \(\eta\) distributions of the \(e^{+},e^{-}\)._

Fig. 3, together with a fit to a classical Breit-Wigner,

\[f_{NR}(m_{ee};m_{Z},\Gamma_{Z})=\frac{\Gamma_{Z}}{2\pi}\frac{1}{(m_{ee}-m_{Z})^{2 }+\Gamma_{Z}^{2}/4} \tag{2}\]

and to a gaussian shape from which it can be seen that an extremely similar fit is obtained if either classical or relativistic Breit-Wigner shapes are used. Also the quality of the Breit-Wigner fits suggest that the influence of the biasing due to the parton luminosity distribution is negligible [9] and will therefore be neglected hereafter.

### Acceptance cuts

For triggering reasons a cut on both electrons with \(P_{t}>20\) GeV will be considered, a condition which is verified by most of the produced electrons. The level-1 trigger rate for electron pairs with \(P_{t}>20\) GeV is 16 kHz at \({\cal L}=1.7\cdot 10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). A table of the acceptance

Figure 3: _The relativistic Breit-Wigner fit to the \(Z^{0}\) mass distribution (—) obtained according to Eq. 1. The fit to the classical Breit-Wigner shape of Eq. 2 (– –), leading to the same parameters, is extremely similar. The gaussian fits to the whole histogram (.....) and to a window of \(\pm 3\) GeV around the \(Z^{0}\) peak (—. —) have, respectively, \(\sigma=1.76\) and \(\sigma=1.47\) GeV and give a poor description of the narrow peak of the distribution in order to better describe its tails._

of several cuts, for the barrel and for the central region, is presented in Table 1 showing that a cut at \(P_{t}>30\) GeV, that could be considered to reject backgrounds, would have also a reasonable acceptance.

By applying also the barrel cut, given by \(-1.5<\eta<1.5\), one sees that 22% of the events survive. The rate of surviving \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}+e^{-}\) events becomes 2.5 Hz, at \({\cal L}=10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). The corresponding \(\eta\) distribution for the electrons is shown in Fig. 4 where one can see that the process is rather flat, specially in the case of the \(P_{t}>20\) GeV cut, giving a good coverage of the considered \(\eta\) domain. The distribution of the angle between \(e^{+}\) and \(e^{-}\) shows that they hit the calorimeter quite far apart.

The inclusion of the end cap calorimeter would enhance substantially the number of events to consider since 53% of the total survive to the cut given by \(-3<\eta<3\), \(P_{t}>20\) GeV. The number of events in each central cell would also slightly increase. The electron pseudorapidity distribution for this cut is shown in Fig. 5, together with the distribution of angles between the two electrons. Although we can find electron pairs at smaller angle than in the case of the barrel cut resulting from \(Z^{0}\)s with high rapidity, the electron showers are still be well separated in space.

We will assume a conservative value of 90% for the efficiency of electron identification. The rates of identified electrons \(e^{\pm}\) becomes (two for each \(Z^{0}\)) 4 Hz in a range from 2 Hz to 5 Hz. We differ the discussion on electron identification and the requirements on tracking to Sec. 7

\end{table}

### Backgrounds

The production of pairs of isolated electrons has relatively low backgrounds with a rather flat distribution on the invariant mass. We are interested in analyzing the influence, in the calibration algorithm, of the expected background rates as will be discussed in Sec. 6. The irreducible contributions come from top decays, beauty and charm cascade decays, together with the electromagnetic Drell-Yan process.

Assuming the standard model top with a mass of 130 GeV one would produce \(t\bar{t}\) at considerable rates which, after decaying, generate isolated electrons pairs that constitute a 4% background to the \(Z^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) signal for a \(P_{t}\) cut of 20 GeV (2% if \(P_{t}>30\) GeV) [7]. One can expect an extra suppression in the order of 1/3 or more by selecting events with \(|m_{e^{-}\to e^{+}}-m_{Z^{0}}|<20\) GeV leading to a background to signal ratio in the order of 1.3% for \(P_{t}>20\) GeV. If one would assume the top mass to have an higher value this ratio would even be more favorable.

Cascade decays of the c and b quarks would generate pairs of non-isolated electrons with a slightly lower cross-section than the signal. Assuming a rejection factor of 50, for \(P_{t}>20\) GeV, by applying a veto on non-isolated electrons, the background would thus be in the order of 2% and by using a invariant mass region around the \(Z^{0}\) peak one would have this background at a level below 1%. Considering the cut \(P_{t}>30\) GeV would further reduce this background by a factor of 5.

The electromagnetic Drell-Yan process, that goes trough an off-shell photon, will have a cross-section for the production of electron pairs with \(P_{t}>20\) GeV, \(|\eta|<1.5\) and \(|m-m_{Z^{0}}|<20\) GeV of \(\sigma_{e^{+}e^{-}}(\gamma^{*})=5\) pb which corresponds to 2% of the signal. The interference of the \(\gamma^{*}\) and the \(Z^{0}\) resonances gives a contribution which is also peaked at the \(Z^{0}\) mass.

The total physical background expected is thus less then 5% of the signal for the considered cuts of \(P_{t}>20\) GeV, \(|\eta|<1.5\) and \(|m-m_{Z^{0}}|<20\) GeV. If required, this ratio can be improved by considering a \(P_{t}\) cut of 30 GeV and a mass window around the \(Z^{0}\) mass of 6 GeV.

Detector simulation procedure

In this section, the particle-level procedure used to simulate the expected ATLAS characteristics, is described. The sensitivity to different approximate prescriptions is investigated, namely in the case of energy sharing among neighbor cells, in order to comment on the need of a more realistic detector study, like a full GEANT simulation.

The information given by the calorimeter involves the following assumptions in the detector response:

* \(\mathbf{E}\) -- Energy resolution in the calorimeter of \[\frac{\sigma_{E}}{E}=\frac{10\%}{\sqrt{E(\mathrm{GeV})}}\oplus 1\%\]
* \(\mathbf{P}\) -- Position determined by the standard barycenter method in the calorimeter with an impact point resolution given by \[\sigma_{r}=\frac{2\mathrm{mm}}{\sqrt{E(\mathrm{GeV})}}\] at a calorimeter which is at 1.5 m from the beam axis.
* \(\mathbf{B}\) -- Vertex uncertainty in the \(z\) direction \(\sigma_{z}\approx 6\mathrm{cm}\), assuming \(\sigma_{x,y}\approx 0\).

The electron energy measurement will be carried out over small areas in pseudorapidity and azimuth and therefore the fluctuations in these measurements due to pile-up give a contribution to the resolution of \(0.3/E_{t}\) for 40 minimum bias events [7], which is very small in this energy range.

The obtained invariant mass distribution, corresponding to the barrel cut, \(|\eta_{1,2}|<1.5\), \(P_{t}^{1,2}>20\) GeV, is represented in Fig. 6. As expected, the effect of detector smearing is mainly to broaden the narrow peak of the Breit-Wigner shape. The broadening of invariant mass, giving a width of \(\sigma_{m}/m=2.8\%\), can be qualitatively described as the direct sum of the natural width \(\sigma_{m}/m=2\%\) and the energy resolution contribution of \((\sigma_{E}/E)/\sqrt{2}\approx 2\%\). The contribution due to the angle resolution is small due to the fact that the electrons are mainly produced at large angles with respect to each other as can be seen in Fig. 4.

The effect of bremsstrahlung of the electrons, that can radiate energy which is not collected in the EM cluster, is not included but it is expected to be much less severe than in the \(E/p\) method since the energy of colinear photons is included. The straightforward generalization of the method presented here to a invariant mass peak including the bremsstrahlung tail is discussed, but one must consider a realistic parametrization of the \(Z^{0}\) peak in the detector which will be available as the result of the full detector simulation. The effects of this tail can be conservatively estimated by using at a cut which tends to eliminate this events, namely by examining the difference between the results using the invariant mass windows of \(\pm\) 20 GeV or \(\pm\) 6 GeV presented here.

Figure 6: _The invariant mass spectrum after the convolution with the detector smearing. The normalization corresponds to the cut of \(|\eta_{1,2}|<1.5,P_{t}>20\) GeV and includes the electron efficiency. The represented fits give a gaussian distribution with \(\sigma=2.58\) (...), a classical Breit-Wigner with \(\Gamma_{Z}=3.46\) ( \(-\) \(-\) \(-\)) and a convoluted shape with natural width and \(\sigma=1.41\) (--). The RMS in the considered interval is 4.04 GeV_

The convolution of the natural shape of the \(Z^{0}\) resonance, described by the Breit-Wigner distribution in Eq. 2, and the gaussian spreading associated with the detector resolution can be understood as the marginal probability density function

\[f(m_{ee};\sigma,m_{Z},\Gamma_{Z})=\int\,dm\,f(m_{ee}|m;\sigma)\,f(m;m_{Z},\Gamma _{Z}) \tag{3}\]

where \(f(m_{ee}|m;\sigma)\) is the probability of measuring a mass \(m_{ee}\) from a event of invariant mass \(m\). These equations lead to the following convoluted shape,

\[f_{e}(m_{ee};\sigma,m_{Z},\Gamma_{Z}) = \frac{\Gamma_{Z}}{\sigma(2\pi)^{3/2}}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\, dm\,\frac{e^{-(m_{ee}-m)^{2}/2\sigma^{2}}}{(m-m_{Z})^{2}+\Gamma_{Z}^{2}/4} \tag{4}\] \[= \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\,\omega_{R}(x+iy) \tag{5}\]

where \(\omega_{R}\) is the real part of the error function [10] of complex argument given by,

\[x+iy=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}\left(m_{Z}-m_{ee}+i\frac{\Gamma_{Z}}{2}\right) \tag{6}\]

## 4 The Invariant Mass Calibration Algorithm

The calibration procedure will determine each cell calibration constant by constraining the invariant mass spectrum to be around the known value of the \(Z^{0}\) mass. Although the least-squares fit algorithm can be used to determine these constants, a more rigorous approach is to apply the maximum likelihood method, assuming that the shape of the probability distribution function is known. We will compare the use of the gaussian shape with the results obtained using the classical Breit-Wigner and the convoluted distributions.

For the event \(i\) we will label \(i+\) and \(i-\) the positron and electron resulting from this event with an invariant mass given by

\[m_{i}=\sqrt{2E_{i+}E_{i-}\left(1-\cos(\theta_{i})\right)} \tag{7}\]

where \(\theta_{i}\) is the angle between \(e^{+}\) and \(e^{-}\). The energy of a given particle can be obtained from the signal, \(S_{r}^{i\pm}\), observed in each cell \(r\), by the expression,

\[E_{i\pm}=\sum_{r}\,k_{r}\,S_{r}^{i\pm}\, \tag{8}\]

where \(k_{r}\) is the calibration constant of cell \(r\). The invariant mass can thus be written as

\[m_{i}=\sqrt{C_{i+}}\sqrt{C_{i-}}m_{i}^{0} \tag{9}\]

where the misscalibrated value of the invariant mass \(m_{i}^{0}\) is obtained by setting the calibration constants to 1 in Eq. 7. The \(C_{i\pm}\) functions are given by

\[C_{i\pm}=\frac{\sum_{r}\,k_{r}\,S_{r}^{i\pm}}{\sum_{r}\,S_{r}^{i\pm}} \tag{10}\]that reduces to the calibration constants in the case of no energy sharing. The whole computation will be based on these functions and their derivatives

\[\frac{\partial\sqrt{C_{i\pm}}}{\partial\sqrt{k_{r}}}=g_{r}^{i\pm}\]

which, for \(k_{r}=1\), are the energy fraction deposited in each cell according to the relations

\[C_{i\pm}(k=1) = 1 \tag{11}\] \[g_{r}^{i\pm}(k=1) = \frac{S_{r}^{i\pm}}{\sum_{l}S_{l}^{i\pm}}\] (12) \[\frac{\partial g_{r}^{i\pm}}{\partial\sqrt{k_{l}}}(k=1) = \delta_{rt}\,g_{r}^{i\pm}-g_{r}^{i\pm}\,g_{l}^{i\pm}. \tag{13}\]

These relations can be applied in the computation of the derivatives of the invariant mass giving,

\[\frac{\partial m_{i}}{\partial\sqrt{k_{l}}}=\left[g_{r}^{i+}+g_{r}^{i-}\right] m_{i}^{0} \tag{14}\]

\[\frac{\partial^{2}m_{i}}{\partial\sqrt{k_{l}}\partial\sqrt{k_{r}}}=\left[g_{r }^{i-}\,g_{l}^{i+}+g_{r}^{i+}\,g_{l}^{i-}-g_{r}^{i+}\,g_{l}^{i+}-g_{r}^{i-}\, g_{l}^{i-}+\delta_{r,l}(g_{r}^{i+}+g_{r}^{i-})\right]\,m_{i}^{0}\, \tag{15}\]

when computed at the value of \(k_{r}=1\) for all cells.

The general procedure to determine the calibration constants consists in solving the maximum likelihood condition,

\[\sum_{i}\frac{\partial\left[\ln(f(m_{i}))\right]}{\partial\sqrt{k_{r}}}=0\, \tag{16}\]

which reduces to the least squares fit expression for a gaussian distribution.

The resolution on the calibration constant will be given by

\[\sigma^{2}(k_{r})=4\sigma^{2}(\sqrt{k_{r}})=4\left\{-\sum_{i}\frac{\partial^{ 2}\left[\ln(f(m_{i}))\right]}{\left(\partial\sqrt{k_{r}}\right)^{2}}\right\}^ {-1} \tag{17}\]

where \(f\) is the probability distribution assigned to the invariant mass.

Since we only consider the events in an interval of invariant mass around the \(Z^{0}\) resonance the probability density function must be normalized in this interval. This normalization does not contribute to the fit because its additive contribution to the logarithm is independent of \(m_{i}\) and hence independent of the calibration constants.

Even in the simplest case using a gaussian distribution and not considering the energy sharing among neighbor cells, Eq. 16 will lead to a set of cubic equations in \(\sqrt{k_{r}}\). It would be very difficult to look in a huge space of calibration constants for the solutions of these equations and we have followed an approximate procedure by developing them in Taylor series.

To assure the proper functioning of the calorimeter one has to have methods of verifying and calibrating, to some degree, the individual modules previously to the final installation.

This initial test of at least some of the cells will allow a first estimate of the calibration constants which can be used in redefining the signal values in such a way that they correspond to calibration constants near to 1. One can thus use the expansion of Eq. 16, up to first order in the calibration constants, leading to a system of linear equations, in \(\epsilon_{r}\) (\(\sqrt{k_{r}}=1+\epsilon_{r}/2\)), of the form

\[A\,\times\,[\epsilon]=\,B\, \tag{18}\]

where the matrices \(A\) and \(B\) are given by

\[A_{l,r} = -\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}\frac{\partial^{2}\left[\ln(f(m_{i}))\right] }{\partial\sqrt{k_{i}}\partial\sqrt{k_{r}}} \tag{19}\] \[B_{r} = \sum_{i}\frac{\partial\left[\ln f(m_{i})\right]}{\partial\sqrt{k _{r}}}. \tag{20}\]

They are given in Appendix A, for the gaussian case, in Appendix B for the Breit-Wigner case and for the convoluted distribution in Appendix C.

These equations do not lead to the exact solution and, in fact, the calculations performed show that the result obtained is rather poor and depends upon the initial calibration. The solution to this problem is quite straightforward if one remarks that the solution of the linear equations becomes increasingly accurate for calibration constants near to \(1\) (\(\sqrt{k_{r}}\approx 1\)). One can thus use the first solution of the equations to redefine the signal values by,

\[S_{r}^{i\pm}\to k_{r}\,S_{r}^{i\pm}\, \tag{21}\]

a signal that should be much closer to the correct energy value. This leads to an improved solution on the second iteration since the expansion is now performed nearer to \(k_{r}=1\). The iteration procedure can be repeated until a self-consistent solution is found. The final value of the calibration constant in each cell is then given by the product of the corresponding results for each iteration.

The predicted standard deviation of the \(k\) distribution is related to the \(A\)-matrix in Eq. 19, according to Eq. 17, by

\[\sigma(k_{r})=\sqrt{2}\sqrt{[A^{-1}]_{rr}} \tag{22}\]

which should be approximate to the obtained accuracy in the calibration.

If one uses for \(A\) the least-square fit expression in Eq. 35 one sees that the main contribution to the diagonal elements comes from the term in \((m_{i}^{0})^{2}\) and can be approximated by,

\[A_{r,r}\approx\frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}n \tag{23}\]

where \(n\) is the number of electron or positrons hitting the cell \(r\). Considering the energy sharing, the main contributions are given by,

\[A_{r,r}\approx\frac{m_{Z}^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\sum_{i\pm}\left(g_{r}^{i\pm}\right) ^{2} \tag{24}\]

according to Eq. 37. The matrix \(A\) has important non-diagonal contributions since each invariant mass measurement always correlates the calibration constants from two cells. If,however, one would assume that the contribution from these terms is small in performing the matrix inversion, the calibrating constant resolution could be expressed as

\[\sigma_{k}\approx\frac{2\,\sigma_{m}/m_{Z}}{\sqrt{n}} \tag{25}\]

for the case without sharing and, in the case of sharing with the significative part of the energy in the central cell, as

\[\sigma_{k}\approx\frac{2\,\sigma_{m}/m_{Z}}{<g_{1}^{1}>\sqrt{n}} \tag{26}\]

where \(<g_{1}^{1}>\) is the average fraction of the energy deposited in the central cell.

## 5 Discussion

The factor of 2 in Eq. 25 reflects the fact that the invariant mass depends upon the product of two calibration constants relative to the cells where the \(e^{+}\) and the \(e^{-}\) have hit. The effect of energy-sharing among neighbor cells, that is predicted by Eq. 26, is quite strong and suggests that essentially only the energy collected by the central cell is useful in the calibration process.

Although the Eq. 25 was obtained in the case of a gaussian distribution, the use of the maximum likelihood condition applied to a classical Breit-Wigner and the convoluted distributions should also scale with \(1/\sqrt{N}\) since the same (\(\delta_{r}^{+}\,\delta_{i}^{\pm}+\delta_{r}^{-}\,\delta_{i}^{\pm}\)) appear in Eqs. 39,44 and the \(g_{r}^{i}\pm\) involved in Eqs. 42,46 are also quite similar to the gaussian ones. This suggests the use of Eq. 25, together with a empirical multiplicative factor to parametrize the resolutions obtained in all cases. The fact that this factor differs from 1 even when the gaussian distribution is used, is due to several approximations involved in this simple expression, namely, the \(\eta\) distribution is not flat even in the interval \(-1.7<\eta<1.7\) making cells at mid-rapidity to have systematically less events and the distribution of the invariant mass spectra is only correctly taken into account when the fit to the convoluted shape is used.

The factor of 2 in the expression of the resolution, in conjunction with the multiplicative constant that has to be included in Eq. 25, represent a considerable inconvenient since, in order to calibrate to the required resolution, one needs to accumulate more than four times the number of events relative to the number that would be required if we were dealing with a quantity linearly dependent upon the energy.

## 6 The Calibration Results

In the ATLAS detector, the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter, spanning the region \(|\eta|<1.5\), with a typical granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) of \(0.025\times 0.025\), will consist of a number of cells in the order of 30000. A realistic simulation involving this number of cells and a correspondingly large number of events would be inappropriate. We have therefore studied situations that involve a small number of cells and examined the possibility of extrapolating the results.

In order to simulate the real calibration procedure we have taken the sample of events given by the physics simulation described previously and applied a smearing to the energy and momentum values of the electrons simulating the ATLAS detector according to Sec. 3. The energy values of the electrons are then changed according to the calibration constants in a definite pattern which is generated by a gaussian distribution. The calibration procedure takes the resulting non-calibrated events and determines a new set of calibration constants, which can be easily tested by multiplying the initial pattern by the obtained approximated calibration constants and looking at the distribution of the resulting values around 1. The estimated resolutions for the calibration constants here presented are obtained in this way when the iterative calibration process described in Sec. 4 has converged.

We have considered the barrel region of \(|\eta|<1.7\) and have divided it into \(n_{\eta}\times n_{\phi}\) cells. A cut on the invariant mass window of \(|m_{e^{+}e^{-}}-m_{Z^{0}}|<20\) GeV is applied which is quite large but allows to consider very pessimistic initial miscalibrations.

Several essays using distributions of initial calibration constants with a standard deviation up to 0.2, showed that the final results are independent of the initial calibration, and that convergence could be achieved even if the initial calibration was very poor.

In Table 2 a sample of the results, obtained using the procedure described above applied to the convoluted shape in Fig. 6, is presented together with the values obtained by the parametrization suggested by Eq. 26, given by,

\[\sigma_{k}=\frac{2\,R\,\sigma_{Z}/m_{Z}}{<g_{1}^{1}>\sqrt{\bar{n}}} \tag{27}\]

where \(\sigma_{Z}=2.60\) GeV according to the gaussian fit in Fig. 6 and \(\bar{n}\) is the average number of hits per cell. The value for the empirical factor, obtained from a product involving the average values of \((\sigma_{k}<g_{1}^{1}>\sqrt{\bar{n}})\), is \(R=1.27\). The simulation was made considering the sharing of the deposited signal among neighbor cells both with a simple model corresponding to a constant -- Fix -- fraction of the energy in each neighbor cells ( given in parenthesis) and with a parametrization of the energy sharing -- Var -- with the constant \(a\) given in parenthesis (see Appendix D for details). It can be seen that the simulation results are very well reproduced by the parametrization in all situations presented, showing that a simple scaling with \(1/\sqrt{\bar{n}}\) for different cell partitions of the barrel region which suggests that an extrapolation to a much finer granularity would be meaningful. Also the effect of energy sharing among neighbor modules, quite independently of the specific parametrization used, can be well described by the \(1/<g_{1}^{1}>\) factor, showing that, depending on the specific technic used for the EM calorimeter, a better shower containment improves the applicability of this method.

Analogous simulations were performed using the maximum likelihood condition applied to the gaussian and the Breit Wigner distributions of Fig. 6. The results can also be very well parametrized by the expression in Eq. 27 but with values for the empirical constant of respectively, \(R=1.87\) and \(R=1.38\). This shows that the maximum likelihood parametrized by the convoluted shape should be used since it gives a much better result of \(R=1.27\).

Once the appropriate parametrization for the invariant mass peak is used, it can be seen from Table. 3 that the accuracy of the method is mainly dominated by the natural shape of the \(Z^{0}\) boson since results do not improve drastically by the use of a detector with a better energy resolution, which is the dominant experimental contribution (see Sec. 3).

These simulations were performed using the interval of \(|\eta|<1.7\) subdivided into cells, however, due to the flatness of the electron \(\eta\) distribution we do not expect this result to change appreciably if one uses an narrower barrel like the one which goes up \(\eta=1.5\) that is considered now for ATLAS.

The calibration algorithm will be applied to data that contains both the physical backgrounds described in Sec. 2.3 and all possible events which survive the electron identification cuts as discussed in Sec. 7. It is therefore important to examine the influence of the background in the efficiency of the calibration method described here. The simulations that included in the \(e^{+},e^{-}\) sample different levels of background, with the shape obtained in the simulation of Sec. 7, showed that the algorithm is very robust in this respect. In fact, by including in the electron sample a number of background events of 17% of the signal, considering the invariant mass interval of \(|m-m_{Z^{0}}|<20\) GeV and a cut of \(P_{t}>20\) GeV, a series of simulation results can be well described by a empirical factor of \(R=1.32\)1, instead of the value \(R=1.27\) obtained previously.

Footnote 1: This value was obtained by considering in Eq. 27 \(\bar{n}\) to be given only by the signal events.

The small influence of the background can be even more reduced by considering a narrower invariant mass window after an initial iteration of the calibration narrows the signal distribution. The simulated procedure in the window given by \(|m-m_{Z^{0}}|<6\) GeV leads to a calibration accuracy very similar to the one obtained previously. An other way to appreciably decrease the background is to enlarge the \(P_{t}\) cut from 20 GeV to \(P_{t}>30\) GeV. The value of the resolution on the calibration constant obtained in this case is however 20% worse due not only to the decrease in the electrons per cell but also to the worse coverage of the mid-rapidity regions according to Fig. 4.

## 7 Requirements on electron identification

The ATLAS detector is extremely optimized for the background rejection from fake electrons in QCD jets in order to allow that much lower signals, like the ones coming from Higgs decays, can be observed. This rejection, if the full tracking potential is available, leads to a negligible background in relation with the \(Z^{0}\) signal. However a rejection against QCD jets from the calorimeter alone, of the order of \(10^{3}\), can still be obtained using only the distinct properties of hadronic and electromagnetic showers. In order to predict the background resulting from using only the calorimeter rejection against fake electrons in QCD jets, a two-jet sample was generated, in the barrel region with \(P_{t}>20\) GeV. Considering the invariant mass window of \(|m-m_{Z}|<20\) GeV, the cross section of the surviving false electrons is \(\sigma_{jj}\)x(Rejection)\({}^{2}=20\) pb which is of the order of 10% of the signal for these cuts. A rejection factor of \(10^{3}\) per jet was assumed, a value which has some uncertainty but can most likely be achieved by increasing the \(P_{t}\) cut to 30 GeV without changing appreciably the results. The background to signal ratio can still be further improved by changing the invariant mass window or the \(P_{t}\) cut considered for both signal and background according to Table 4.

The background of 10% of fake electrons from jets, together with a physics background of less the 5% is reasonably small and well in the range accepted by the calibration method as was discussed in Sec. 6.

The calibration method based on the \(Z^{0}\) invariant mass resonance is not only independent of the measurement of the electron momentum performed by the tracking but it can also accommodate the backgrounds resulting from using only the calorimeter rejection to perform the electron identification. This method can therefore be used without any information coming from tracking.

## 8 The \(E/p\) cross calibration

The results presented above show a degradation of the resolution due to the effect of energy sharing among the neighbor cells. One can argue whether a similar result occurs in E/p calibration of the EM calorimeter using the tracking momentum measurement and this study will investigate this hypothesis.

The E/p calibration procedure can use any isolated electron that can be produced in several processes, namely, \(Z^{0},W^{\pm}\) and \(b\) decays. These single electron events are however difficult to trigger at high luminosity, since the level 1 trigger rate expected would be very high at LHC ( 31 kHz with \(P_{t}>40\) GeV at \({\cal L}=1.7\times 10^{34}\,cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) with isolation cuts)[7].

Bremsstrahlung of the electrons in this energy range would most often lead to a spoiling

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline QCD Back. / Signal & \(P_{t}>20\) GeV & \(P_{t}>30\) GeV \\ \hline \(|m-m_{Z}|<20\) GeV & 10\% & 7\% \\ \(|m-m_{Z}|<6\) GeV & 3\% & 2\% \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: The background to signal ratio induced by fake electrons from jets.

of the E/p measurement since the radiated photon energy will be collected very often in the calorimeter together with the electron. A cut around the peak of E/p=1 can eliminate most of these events at the price of a reasonable efficiency.

If the \(P_{t}\) threshold for triggering single electron can be further improved much higher rates of single electrons can be expected. In addition the number of events needed to perform the calibration up to the required accuracy tends to be smaller due to the fact that the resolution on the E/p method is not limited by the \(Z^{0}\) boson width but results only from the resolution of the momentum and energy measurements made in the tracking and on the calorimeter. Also the expression of the calibration constant, \(k=E_{i}^{0}/p_{i}\), with \(E_{i}^{0}\) the non-calibrated value for the energy, leads to a resolution for \(k\) of \(\sigma_{k}=\sigma(E/p)/\sqrt{n}\), which does not involve an extra factor of 2 as in Eq. 25. We will investigate the effect of energy sharing among the neighbor modules and how does it affect the previous expression considering a resolution \(\sigma(E/p)=3\%\), as can be expected in ATLAS resulting from a momentum measurement with a resolution of the order of \(\delta p_{T}/p_{T}=5\times 10^{-4}\,p_{T}\oplus 1\%\), plus the resolution of the calorimeter energy measurement.

### Energy sharing

The calibration procedure consists of a least-squares fit to the E/p distribution around the value of 1, that minimizes

\[\chi^{2}=\sum_{i}\,\frac{\left(E_{i}/p_{i}-1\right)^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}. \tag{28}\]

The energy measured in the calorimeter \(E_{i}\) can be written as,

\[E_{i}=\sum_{r}\,k_{r}\,g_{r}^{i}\,E_{i}^{0}. \tag{29}\]

The extremum condition obtained is given by,

\[\sum_{l}\,k_{l}\,\left\{\sum_{i}\left(\frac{E_{i}^{0}}{p_{i}}\right)^{2}g_{l}^ {i}g_{r}^{i}\right\}=\sum_{i}\,\frac{E_{i}^{0}}{p_{i}}\,g_{r}^{i} \tag{30}\]

where the values of \(g_{r}^{i}\) are given by Eq.12 when all \(k_{r}\) are near to 1. The resolution obtained is given by

\[\sigma_{k}\approx\frac{\sigma(E/p)}{<g_{1}^{1}>\sqrt{n}} \tag{31}\]

that results from the covariance matrix,

\[\frac{\partial^{2}\mathrm{ln}(f)}{(\partial k_{r})^{2}} = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\,\sum_{i}\left(\frac{E_{i}^{0}}{p_{i}} \right)^{2}(g_{r}^{i})^{2} \tag{32}\] \[\approx \frac{n}{\sigma^{2}}<g_{1}^{1}>^{2}. \tag{33}\]

The calibration accuracy results presented in Table 5 are in agreement with Eq. 31 and show a degradation of the resolution similar to the one verified in the invariant mass fit.

The effect of the sharing of the energy between the neighbor cells is much more crucial for ATLAS, due to the very high granularity of the EM calorimeter, than for other detectors[2] where the \(E/p\) calibration method has been applied.

## Appendix A Least-Squares fit expressions

The final expressions for matrix \(A\) and \(B\), using the gaussian parametrization, and assuming that all energy in the shower is deposited in one cell, are given by,

\[B_{r} = -\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\sum_{i}m_{i}^{0}\,(m_{i}^{0}-m_{Z})(\delta_{r }^{i+}+\delta_{r}^{i-}) \tag{34}\] \[A_{r,l} = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\sum_{i}\Bigg{\{}\frac{(m_{i}^{0})^{2}}{2}( \delta_{r}^{i+}\,\delta_{l}^{i+}+\delta_{r}^{i-}\,\delta_{l}^{i-})\] (35) \[+ \left((m_{i}^{0})^{2}-\frac{m_{i}^{0}\,m_{z}}{2}\right)(\delta_{r }^{i+}\,\delta_{l}^{i-}+\delta_{r}^{i-}\,\delta_{l}^{i+})\Bigg{\}}\]

or by,

\[B_{r} = -\frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\sum_{i}m_{i}^{0}(m_{i}^{0}-m_{Z})(g_{r}^{i +}+g_{r}^{i-}) \tag{36}\] \[A_{r,l} = \frac{1}{\sigma^{2}}\sum_{i}\Bigg{\{}\frac{m_{i}^{0}m_{Z}}{2}(g_{ r}^{i+}g_{l}^{i+}+g_{r}^{i-}\,g_{l}^{i-})\] (37) \[+ \left((m_{i}^{0})^{2}-\frac{m_{i}^{0}\,m_{Z}}{2}\right)(g_{r}^{i +}\,g_{l}^{i-}+g_{r}^{i-}\,g_{l}^{i+})\] \[+ \delta_{r,l}\frac{m_{i}^{0}(m_{i}^{0}-m_{Z})}{2}(g_{r}^{i+}+g_{r} ^{i-})\Bigg{\}}\]

if one considers the energy sharing among neighbor modules.

The numerical implementation of these expressions can be done by accumulating event by event the matrix elements whose indices (cells) have energy deposited by the event, that is, for each event \(i\) only the matrix elements \(B_{n(i+)},B_{n(i-)}\) and \(A_{n(i+),n(i+)}\), \(A_{n(i+),n(i-)}\), \(A_{n(i-),n(i+)}\), \(A_{n(i-),n(i+)}\), \(A_{n(i-),n(i-)}\) are updated.

## Appendix B Maximum likelihood expressions for a Breit-Wigner Shape

The final expressions for matrix \(A\) and \(B\), in the case of the Breit-Wigner distribution, assuming that all energy in the shower is deposited in one cell, are given by

\[B_{r} = -2\sum_{i}\frac{m_{i}^{0}(m_{i}^{0}-m_{Z})}{(m_{i}^{0}-m_{Z})^{2 }+\Gamma^{2}/4}(\delta_{r}^{i+}+\delta_{r}^{i-}) \tag{38}\] \[A_{r,l} = \sum_{i}\Bigg{\{}-(m_{i}^{0})^{2}\frac{(m_{i}^{0}-m_{Z})^{2}- \Gamma^{2}/4}{(m_{i}^{0}-m_{Z})^{2}+\Gamma^{2}/4}(\delta_{r}^{i+}\,\delta_{l} ^{i+}+\delta_{r}^{i-}\,\delta_{l}^{i-})\] (39) \[- \left((m_{i}^{0})^{2}\frac{(m_{i}^{0}-m_{Z})^{2}-\Gamma^{2}/4}{( m_{i}^{0}-m_{Z})^{2}+\Gamma^{2}/4}-(m_{i}^{0})^{2}+m_{i}^{0}m_{z}\right)\] \[\times \frac{1}{(m_{i}^{0}-m_{Z})^{2}+\Gamma^{2}/4}(\delta_{r}^{i+}\, \delta_{l}^{i-}+\delta_{r}^{i-}\,\delta_{l}^{i+})\Bigg{\}}\]

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

\[+ \left(\left(\frac{m_{i}^{0}}{\sqrt{2}\,\sigma}\right)^{2}\,\frac{ \frac{\partial^{2}q_{x}}{\partial x^{2}}\omega_{R}-\left(\frac{\partial\omega_{R }}{\partial x}\right)^{2}}{\omega_{R}^{2}}+\frac{m_{i}^{0}}{\sqrt{2}\sigma} \frac{\frac{\partial\omega_{R}}{\partial x}}{\omega_{R}}\right)\left(g_{r}^{i+ }g_{l}^{i-}+g_{r}^{i+}g_{l}^{i-}\right)\] \[- \frac{m_{i}^{0}}{\sqrt{2}\,\sigma}\frac{\frac{\partial\omega_{R}} {\partial}}{\omega}\delta_{r,l}(g_{r}^{i+}+g_{r}^{i-})\right\}\.\]

The complex error function was computed using routine WWERF from CERN library. The values of the first and second derivative, with respect to the variable x, are equal to the values of the complex derivatives obtained by [10],

\[\frac{d\omega}{dz} = -2\,z\,\omega(z)+\frac{2\,i}{\sqrt{\pi}} \tag{47}\] \[\frac{d^{2}\omega}{dz^{2}} = -2\,z\,\frac{d\omega}{dz}-2\,\omega(z) \tag{48}\]

where \(z\) is the complex variable \(z=x+iy\).

The numerical implementation of these expressions can be done like in the other cases.

## Appendix D Energy-sharing prescriptions

A realistic simulation of the shower energy deposition in each cell would be difficult to implement since it would require the integration of the shower lateral profile over each cell or, to include fluctuations, a complete GEANT description. We have proceeded by taking two simple descriptions, one in which the energy is shared with a fixed percentage - Fix - (typically 60%) for the central and for the 8 neighbor cells (typically 5%). The influence of energy sharing among different cells was also studied in more detail by assuming that the energy deposited would be dependent on the impact point - Var -. Considering that the coordinates \(X\) and \(Y\) in the pseudorapidity and azimuth directions are normalized to the cell size, they always span the interval \([0,1]\). We have considered the exponential dependence of the fractions of energy given by,

\[g_{2}^{1} = ae^{2X-1}\] \[g_{3}^{1} = ae^{X+Y-1}\] \[g_{4}^{1} = ae^{2Y-1}\] \[g_{5}^{1} = ae^{Y-X}\] \[g_{6}^{1} = ae^{1-2X}\] \[g_{7}^{1} = ae^{1-X-Y}\] \[g_{8}^{1} = ae^{1-2Y}\] \[g_{9}^{1} = ae^{X-Y}\] \[g_{1}^{1} = 1-g_{2}^{1}-g_{3}^{1}-g_{4}^{1}-g_{5}^{1}-g_{6}^{1}-g_{7}^{1}-g_{8 }^{1}-g_{9}^{1} \tag{49}\]

where cell numbers are given according to Fig. 7 and \(a\) is a constant. By performing some simple integrations one can compute the average fraction of energy deposited in the central cell \(<g_{1}^{1}>\), assuming an uniform distribution of events, as given by the expression,

\[<g_{1}^{1}>=1-9.0455a. \tag{50}\]This algorithm although not fully realistic induces fluctuations in the sharing of energy among neighbor cells which are closer to the real situation.
