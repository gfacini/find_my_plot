**Abstract**

Within the ATLAS \(B\)-physics programme it is foreseen to study \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations and measure the mixing parameter \(\Delta m_{s}\). The measurement of this parameter is an important input for the determination of other \(B_{s}^{0}\) parameters from e.g. the decay \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\Psi\phi\), in particular the lifetime difference \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\) and the weak phase \(\phi_{s}\). The hadronic \(B_{s}^{0}\) decay modes to \(D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) with \(D_{s}^{-}\rightarrow\phi(\to K^{+}K^{-})\pi^{-}\) and \(a_{1}^{+}\rightarrow\rho^{0}(\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-})\pi^{+}\) are used in this analysis to evaluate the number of signal events expected for an integrated luminosity of \(30~{}{\rm fb}^{-1}\) and to determine the \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity using the amplitude fit method. Four classes of trigger scenarios are considered, each with different trigger conditions: a single-muon trigger, a di-muon trigger, a muon-electron trigger and a combined muon-lepton trigger. This analysis, performed on Monte Carlo particle-level, shows that besides the single-muon trigger the combined muon-lepton trigger has the largest potential to be used at the ATLAS detector.

## 1 Introduction

The observed flavour eigenstates \(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) are linear combinations of the two mass eigenstates \(H\) and \(L\). Due to the non-conservation of flavour in charged weak-current interactions, transitions \(B_{s}^{0}\rightarrow\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) and \(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\to B_{s}^{0}\) occur. At lowest order this oscillation is described in the Standard Model by box diagrams involving two \(W\) bosons and two up-type quarks. The oscillation frequency is proportional to \(\Delta m_{s}=m_{H}-m_{L}\). A detailed description of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillation mechanism is given in [1].

Predictions for possible \(\Delta m_{s}\) values are provided by fits of the unitarity triangle parameters [2, 3]. Including New Physics parameters the \(\Delta m_{s}\) value is expected in the interval \(8.9~{}{\rm ps}^{-1}<\Delta m_{s}<29.6~{}{\rm ps}^{-1}\) (95% CL) [3]. The first experimentally observed two-sided bound on the \(B^{0}_{s}-\bar{B}^{0}_{s}\) oscillation frequency was recently reported by the DO collaboration [4]: \(17~{}{\rm ps}^{-1}\)\(<\Delta m_{s}<21~{}{\rm ps}^{-1}\) (90% CL), with a most probable value of \(\Delta m_{s}=19~{}{\rm ps}^{-1}\). The DO analysis was performed with a sample of semileptonic decays \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}\mu^{+}X\). The first measurement of \(\Delta m_{s}\) was reported by the CDF collaboration [5] with \(\Delta m_{s}\)=\((17.77\pm 0.10{\rm(stat)}\pm 0.07{\rm(syst)})~{}{\rm ps}^{-1}\) combining semileptonic and hadronic decay channels.

In the study presented here two signal channels are considered, which are most promising to observe \(B^{0}_{s}-\bar{B}^{0}_{s}\) oscillations with the ATLAS detector: \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\), with \(D^{-}_{s}\to\phi\pi^{-}\) and \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\). For the decay channel \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) the \(a^{+}_{1}\) decays as \(a^{+}_{1}\to\rho^{0}\pi^{+}\) and \(\rho^{0}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\).

As the trigger rate for \(B\)-physics at ATLAS is limited [6], different trigger strategies are studied. In this analysis Monte Carlo events generated with Pythia are used. In addition to the standard single-muon trigger a di-muon trigger, which is already foreseen for the ATLAS \(B\)-physics programme, is studied. This allows the usage of a second trigger condition with low \(p_{T}\) thresholds even at higher luminosities. Additionally, the potential of a muon-electron trigger and a combined muon-lepton trigger is investigated.

The analysis methods used in this study are presented in section 2. In section 3 the results for the different trigger scenarios are compared.

## 2 Analysis

### MC data and trigger conditions

For the analysis 50.000 events of each signal channel are generated. The events of the type \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) are produced with Pythia 6.203, the events of the type \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) with Pythia 6.226. In both channels \(b\)-quark pairs are generated in \(pp\)-collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14~{}{\rm TeV}\). The \(\bar{b}\)-quark is forced to produce the signal \(B\)-decay. A transverse momentum of \(p_{T}>0.5~{}{\rm GeV}\) and a pseudorapidity of \(|\eta|<2.5\) for all charged final-state particles from the \(B\)-decay is required. In addition in every event a muon with \(p_{T}>6~{}{\rm GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) is required.

Four classes of different trigger scenarios are simulated:

* a single-muon trigger with a variable cut on the muon with the highest \(p_{\rm T}\),
* a di-muon trigger with variable cuts on the two muons with the highest and the second highest \(p_{\rm T}\),
* a muon-electron trigger with variable cuts on the muon with the highest \(p_{\rm T}\) and the electron with the highest \(p_{\rm T}\) and
* a combined muon-lepton trigger merging the di-muon trigger scenario and the muon-electron trigger scenario. A variable cut on the muon with the highest \(p_{\rm T}\) is applied, and a second lepton (muon or electron) is required.

### Trigger efficiency and wrong tag fraction

For each trigger scenario different trigger conditions are simulated by modifying the cuts on \(p_{T}\). Counting the number of triggered events \(N_{trig}\) for each trigger condition the relative trigger efficiency is calculated as \(\epsilon=N_{trig}/N_{all}\) where \(N_{all}\) is the total number of events generated. For the single-muon trigger scenario with \(p_{T}(\mu)>6~{}{\rm GeV}\) the number of events expected for \(10~{}{\rm fb}^{-1}\)(oneyear of data taking at a luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)) is extracted from [7], \(N_{B_{s}D_{s}\pi}^{exp}=2693\) and \(N_{B_{s}D_{s}a_{1}}^{exp}=1276\). This trigger condition corresponds to \(\epsilon=1\). Possibly used pre-scale factors for each trigger condition are not considered.

For the di-muon trigger scenario an additional correction factor of 0.82 is applied to \(\epsilon\). This takes into account the muon detection efficiency for the second muon. Supposing the electron detection efficiency is roughly the same, the same correction factor is applied to the muon-electron trigger.

The original flavour of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson is tagged by the charge of the muon with the highest \(p_{T}\), assuming that this muon originates from a semileptonic decay of the opposite side \(b\) quark. Since in our sample only \(B_{s}^{0}\) events are used, the events with the muon with highest \(p_{T}\) being negatively charged are counted as "correctly tagged" (\(N_{c}\)), the other events are counted as "wrong tagged"(\(N_{w}\)), resulting in a wrong tag fraction \(\omega=N_{w}/N_{trig}\), where \(N_{trig}=N_{c}+N_{w}\). The sources of this wrong tag fraction are investigated for the different trigger conditions. There are three major sources of positively charged muons which cause wrong tags:

* muons coming from a \(\bar{b}\)-quark (\(\omega_{\bar{b}}\)). These muons can only originate from additional \(b\bar{b}\)-pairs, because in our specific analysis one \(\bar{b}\)-quark provides the signal decay.
* muons coming from a \(c\)-quark. These muons can either come from \(c\bar{c}\)-pairs (\(\omega_{c\bar{c}}\)) or from a \(c\)-quark coming from a decay cascade of a \(b\)-quark (\(\omega_{casc}\)). The latter either originates from the opposite side \(b\)-quark or from any additional \(b\bar{b}\)-quark pair.
* muons coming from a \(J/\Psi\) decay (\(\omega_{J/\Psi}\)). These events could be rejected by an invariant mass cut.
* muons coming from other sources (\(\omega_{other}\)).

The wrong tag fraction can therefore be written \(\omega=\omega_{\bar{b}}+\omega_{c\bar{c}}+\omega_{casc}+\omega_{J/\Psi}+\omega_ {other}\).

Wrong tag due to oscillation is another contributing factor. However, this study is not going to consider this issue. No \(B\)-meson oscillation is included in the simulation. Therefore the wrong tag fractions given in this analysis are lower than expected in the experiment. The oscillation process of a \(B_{d}^{0}\) or \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson formed by the \(b\) quark, which is used for tagging, will lead to an increase in the wrong tag fraction. A realistic wrong tag fraction for a single muon trigger including this oscillation is estimated to be 22% [9].

#### Estimation of \(\Delta m_{s}\) and maximum likelihood fit

The maximum value of \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurable for a certain trigger scenario is estimated using the amplitude fit method on a "data sample" generated by a simplified Monte Carlo model. For each channel a sample is generated with the input parameters \(N_{sig}\), \(N_{B_{d}^{0}}\), \(N_{cb}\) and \(\omega\), where \(N_{sig}\) is the number of expected signal events, \(N_{B_{d}^{0}}\) the number of expected background events oscillating with \(\Delta m_{d}\) and \(N_{cb}\) the combinatorial background. The wrong tag fraction \(\omega\) is combined from both signal channels and weighted according to the number of expected signal events. The amplitude fit method [10] is applied to these samples to calculate the \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity. The characteristics of the values affecting the proper-time resolution like the uncertainty in the measurement of the transverse decay length are taken from [7]. The number of expected background events are extracted from [7] too and scaled, assuming that the efficiencies for signal channels and background channels are the same for different trigger scenarios. The resulting \(\Delta m_{s}\) reach values are 95% CL sensitivity limits calculated applying statistical errors only; no systematic errors are evaluated. A detailed description of the amplitude fit method used in our study is given in [7, 8].

Results for different trigger scenarios

In Table 1 results for different trigger conditions using the single-muon trigger scenario are compared. By increasing the trigger cut from \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV to \(p_{T}(\mu)>8\) GeV, roughly 50% of the events are lost for each channel. The wrong tag fraction \(\omega\) decreases as well, but this cannot compensate for the number of events lost due to the higher trigger cut. With an increasing cut on \(p_{T}(\mu)\) the 95% CL sensitivity for \(\Delta m_{s}\), calculated for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), decreases continuously. For the trigger cut of \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV we obtain a \(\Delta m_{s}\) value of 40.0 ps\({}^{-1}\). Again, this number is derived without taking the wrong tag fraction due to oscillations into account. Readers interested in a study with more complex wrong tag fraction treatment are referred to [7].

Using a di-muon trigger, the expected number of events is shown in Table 2. Only 3% of the generated events pass the trigger condition of \(p_{T}(\mu_{1})>6\) GeV, \(p_{T}(\mu_{2})>3\) GeV. The wrong tag fractions of the di-muon trigger scenario are significantly larger compared to the single-muon trigger scenario. Using the amplitude fit method for an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), \(\Delta m_{s}=16.2\) ps\({}^{-1}\) is calculated as the maximum oscillation frequency measurable at 95% CL. This result is shown in Figure 1. This limit is slightly below the \(\Delta m_{s}\) value measured by the CDF collaboration.

The composition of the wrong tag fraction for \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) is summarised in Table 5. The results for \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) are similar. In all trigger scenarios the largest part of muons causing a wrong tag are coming from hadrons containing a \(c\)-quark. Most of these hadrons are products of decay chains from a \(b\)-quark, but also additional \(b\bar{b}\)- and \(c\bar{c}\)-pairs account for them. For the single muon trigger scenario only a very small fraction is coming from a \(\bar{b}\)-quark or from a \(J/\Psi\). Using a di-muon trigger enriches the selection with \(J/\Psi\)-particles which contribute a significant fraction of wrong tags. The wrong tag fraction \(\omega_{J/\Psi}\) increases with increasing cut on the muon with the second highest \(p_{T}\) (\(\mu_{2}\)), but it could be reduced by applying an invariant mass window cut around the \(J/\Psi\)-mass. For the muon-electron trigger scenario, almost all contributions to the wrong tag fraction consist of muons originating from a \(c\)-quark from a \(b\)-quark decay cascade.

With higher cuts on \(p_{T}\) of the second muon also the number of events with more than one \(b\bar{b}\)-pair is increasing. Accordingly, the percentage of wrong tags from \(\bar{b}\)-quarks (\(\omega_{\bar{b}}\)) is increasing (see Table 6). Requiring a second trigger muon also increases the number of events with one or more \(c\bar{c}\)-pairs, resulting in a higher wrong tag fraction from \(c\)-quarks and \(J/\Psi\).

The muon-electron trigger scenario (see Table 3) with \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV and \(p_{T}(e)>3\) GeV gives comparable numbers of expected events and wrong tag fractions to the di-muon trigger. The 95 % CL limit for measuring \(\Delta m_{s}\) using an integrated luminosity of 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) is 16.3 ps\({}^{-1}\) and is below the value measured by the CDF collaboration (see Figure 2), too.

The overlap of triggered events from the muon-electron trigger scenario with the di-muon trigger scenario is small. Only 2,5% (2,9%) of the events for \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) (\(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\)) passing the muon-electron trigger with \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV and \(p_{T}(e)>3\) GeV pass the di-muon trigger with \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV and \(p_{T}(\mu)>3\) GeV as well. Therefore, the combined muon-lepton scenario, the combination of the di-muon and muon-electron trigger scenario, is investigated in order to increase the number of events expected. As shown in Table 4, the number of events expected is nearly doubled compared to the di-muon or muon-electron trigger scenario using the same cuts on \(p_{T}\). This leads to an increased \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity of 21.5 ps\({}^{-1}\) (see Figure 3) for the trigger cuts \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV and \(p_{T}(\ell)>3\) GeV which is well above the value measured by CDF.

Conclusions

For different trigger scenarios (single-muon, di-muon, muon-electron and combined muon-lepton trigger scenario) the estimated number of events expected for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\), wrong tag fractions and the \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity limits (95% CL) are presented for different cuts on the \(p_{T}\) of the trigger lepton(s). This analysis has been performed on Monte Carlo particle-level.

For the single-muon trigger scenario the number of events is strongly correlated with the \(p_{T}\) cut on the trigger muon. Increasing the trigger cut from \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV to \(p_{T}(\mu)>8\) GeV corresponds to a loss of \(\sim 50\%\) of the triggered events and a decrease in the \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity of roughly 10 -15%. We established that we should rather use a trigger condition of \(p_{T}(\mu)>6\) GeV even if the wrong tag fraction is larger than for the case with \(p_{T}(\mu)>8\) GeV.

For the stand-alone di-muon trigger scenario the number of events is not satisfying due to the low relative trigger efficiency compared to the single-muon trigger scenario. The wrong tag fraction calculated on generator level increases from \(\sim 10\%\) (single-muon trigger) to \(\sim 30\%\) for the di-muon trigger scenario if the muon with the highest \(p_{\rm T}\) is used for the tag. Without taking systematic errors into account the \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity (95% CL) for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) is below the value measured by CDF.

The number of events expected and the \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity (95% CL) for the muon-electron trigger scenario are comparable to those of the di-muon trigger scenario.

The combined muon-lepton trigger with a wrong tag fraction of about 30% and a \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity (95% CL) for 30 fb\({}^{-1}\) of 21.5 ps\({}^{-1}\) seems to be the most promising trigger scenario besides the single-muon trigger scenario.

The composition of the wrong tag fractions has been studied. The main contribution is given by events with muons coming from a \(c\)-quark. In the di-lepton case the contribution is enhanced by the trigger selection. Also the contribution from muons from a \(J/\Psi\) decay becomes important.

Therefore, for low luminosities in the range \(\lesssim 10^{33}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) a single-muon trigger with a trigger cut as low as possible is preferable. For luminosities \(\gtrsim 2\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) a single-muon trigger is not applicable due to the limitations in the acceptable trigger rate. As a combined muon-lepton trigger provides an acceptable LVL1 trigger output rate, the combined muon-lepton trigger scenario could be used as a possible trigger strategy at higher luminosity to increase the accuracy of the measurement of \(\Delta m_{s}\).

## 5 Next steps

Further studies of the di-muon and of the combined muon-lepton trigger scenario with the aim to improve the wrong tag fraction are needed. Especially, employing a more complex tagging scheme using a combination of multi-lepton or other tagging methods, for instance a jet charge tag [11], is expected to improve the wrong tag fraction and therefore the effective statistics. In addition, in this study the reconstruction efficiency is assumed to be the same for low and high luminosities. This should be considered in a more detailed analysis, which will also investigate the effects of systematic uncertainties.
