###### Abstract

This short note presents a simple extrapolation of ATLAS expectations on the discovery potential of inclusive searches for supersymmetry based on selections using jets and missing transverse energy, with and without leptons. The considered LHC running scenarios are centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 9 TeV and integrated luminosities of 1, 2, 5 and 10 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\).

If strongly interacting Supersymmetry (SUSY) particles (squarks and gluinos) are present at the TeV-scale, they should be copiously produced in the 7 TeV collisions at the LHC: for \(m_{\rm SUSY}=m({\rm squark}){=}\)\(m({\rm gluinos}){=}\)0.5(0.7) TeV, the expected SUSY particle pair production cross-section at NLO+NLL in pp collisions at a centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV is 20 (1) pb [1, 2]. Therefore SUSY discovery is possible around the TeV mass scale if enough LHC luminosity is available at this centre-of-mass energy. ATLAS [3] has already performed several studies at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [4], 10 TeV [5, 6] and 14 TeV [7]. The 5\(\sigma\) discovery reach from these studies is summarized in Table 1.

The discovery reach scales as \({\cal L}^{1/\alpha}\) where \(\alpha\) is the combination of two factors \(\alpha_{1}\) and \(\alpha_{2}\) going in opposite directions: a dependence of the production cross-section going as \(m^{-\alpha_{1}}\), and, for a fixed selection, a selection efficiency going like \(m^{\alpha_{2}}\). By assuming a value of 4 for \(\alpha\), the three points in Table 1 are reasonably parametrised. From the estimates at different \(\sqrt{s}\), the 5\(\sigma\) discovery reach scales roughly as \(\sqrt{s}/10\). From these parameterizations, and taking as a reference the results for \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV and 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) (Figure 1), a rough estimate of the SUSY 5\(\sigma\) discovery reach in TeV for different \(\sqrt{s}\) and luminosity scenarios follows:

\[m_{SUSY}\sim\sqrt{s}/10\times{\cal L}^{0.25} \tag{1}\]

for \(\sqrt{s}\) in TeV and \({\cal L}\) in fb\({}^{-1}\). Table 2 and Figure 2 show the corresponding SUSY 5\(\sigma\) discovery reach for different LHC scenarios envisaged. An increase of 1 TeV of the centre-of-mass energy or a doubling of the luminosity are approximately equivalent and raise the SUSY 5\(\sigma\) discovery reach by 0.1-0.3 TeV.
