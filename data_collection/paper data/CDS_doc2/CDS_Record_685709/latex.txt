###### Abstract

The energy resolution of jets in the endcap liquid argon calorimeters is studied. Energy resolution results are obtained using two different hadronic transport codes, GCALOR and GEANT-FLUKA. The combined effects on the resolution of the magnetic field, inner detector material, cone size used in reconstruction, and the effect of jet to jet shower evolution differences are discussed. Finally, the effect of minimum bias pileup noise on the jet energy resolution in the endcap is investigated and a series of cuts designed to reduce the impact of pileup noise are introduced.

Introduction

The energy resolution achieved for jets in the ATLAS calorimetry system will be affected by many factors including the amount of material in front of the calorimeters, minimum bias pileup noise, the algorithms and cuts used in the reconstruction, and the quality of the calibration. While neglecting these effects can be useful when designing a calorimeter, the "intrinsic jet resolution" thus obtained will be very different than the resolution attained by the actual system used to make physics measurements. Previous notes [2][3][9][10] have reported results in which many, if not all, of the above effects were neglected. The study presented in this note attempts to obtain a more realistic estimate of the actual jet resolution of the ATLAS endcap calorimeters by including some of the detector effects mentioned above.

In this study, fully simulated \(\mathrm{d}\overline{\mathrm{d}}\) dijet events were used to measure the energy resolution of the calorimeters. The generation method used for these jets is described in section 2 of this note. In section 3, the calibration and reconstruction methods which were used to define and compare the energy of the jets at the vertex to the energy seen in the calorimeter are described.

The results of the energy resolution analysis are presented in section 4. The effects of the material and magnetic field on the resolution are evaluated as well as the contribution due to jet to jet differences which include fluctuations in the shape, particle content, and energy spectrum of the jets. The energy resolution of jets when all of the above effects are included is then presented for various reconstruction cone sizes. The behaviour of the calibration weighting constants is also discussed. In order to better understand the results for jets, single particle energy resolutions as well as e/\(\pi\) and e/h ratios are given.

Section 5 presents the study of the energy resolution in the presence of minimum bias pileup noise. The section begins with a description of the pileup inclusion method and of the cuts applied. The jet scale and energy resolution with pileup noise is then evaluated for different cones sizes and cell level energy cuts. Following the presentation of the results a discussion of their implications for physics analysis is presented in section 6.

## 2 Generation of the Data Sample

For the purposes of this study, \(\mathrm{d\overline{d}}\) dijet events were generated using ATGEN/PYTHIA version 5.7 at transverse energies of 15, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 and 180 GeV. For each of these energies, 500 dijets were produced at each of \(\eta\)=2.1, \(\eta\)=2.3, and \(\eta\)=2.5. Dijets were selected for this study due to their more realistic angular energy distribution and particle multiplicity when compared to single jets as reported by Cozzi and Perini [3]. Single jets, which have been commonly used for calibration of the calorimeters in the simulation, are unrealistically narrow in angular scope and can be misleading when used for studies which take into account jet cone size.

The minimum bias four vectors used to generate fully simulated pileup events were also generated with ATGEN/PYTHIA version 5.7. A total of 5000 minimum bias events were prepared using the datacards shown in table 1.

Both the dijet and minimum bias four vectors were passed through the detector simulation using DICE version 2.04 and GEANT version 3.2130. The GEANT default energy threshold cuts were applied during the full simulation of the dijets. A modified version of the ATL-TP3 datacard which removed the endcap preshower and moved the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters 7 cm closer to the interaction point in \(z\) was used. This endcap configuration corresponded to the design specification of the ATLAS Technical Proposal [1].

All detector components in the simulation conformed to the standard ATL-TP3 geometries except for a new hadronic endcap module. This geometry included all inter-plate gaps as well as the copper/kapton electrodes inside the liquid argon. The definition of individual detector elements in the hadronic endcap geometry allowed the use of real calorimeter cells and not the perfectly projective (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) bins present in the standard TP3 geometry. The granularity of the electromagnetic calorimeter was \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.025\) with three longitudinal segments. The hadronic calorimeter had four longitudinal segments and a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.05\times 0.1\) from \(\eta\)=1.5 to \(\eta\)=1.8 and \(0.1\times 0.1\) from \(\eta\)=1.8 to \(\eta\)=3.2. The hadronic endcap geometry followed the specifications of the engineering diagram shown in figure 1.

For the study involving single particles, the \(\gamma\) threshold was set at 100 KeV and the hadronic threshold was set at 1 MeV. The geometry used was a standalone version of GEANT which included the detailed description of the hadronic calorimeter described previously without any other material present. The material of the rest of the ATLAS detector was excluded from the single particle study in order to extract the intrinsic parameters of the hadronic endcap calorimeter.

As previously reported by the authors [4], important differences have been found between jet energy resolutions measured using different hadronic transport codes. In order to investigate these differences, the jet production (but not the minimum bias production) was duplicated for each of two hadronic transport packages: GEANT-FLUKA and GCALOR. The default hadronic transport code used in DICE, GHEISHA, was not used in the jet simulation.

## 3 Jet Reconstruction and Calibration Procedure

The "true" energy, \(E^{\rm true}\), of the jets was defined at the particle level as the energy of the particles at the vertex contained in a cone of given \(\Delta\)R\(=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) centred around the initial parton's direction. Thus, \(E^{\rm true}\) has a maximum of the original parton energy if all of the initial jet particles are contained within the cone. A true jet finding algorithm was not used as the goal of the study was to measure the jet energy resolution around a specific \(\eta\) centre. The value of \(E^{\rm true}\) was used as the target energy of the jet in the calibration procedure. The deposited energy in each longitudinal segment of the electromagnetic (ENDE) and hadronic (ENDH) endcap calorimeters was summed over all cells in a cone of given \(\Delta\)R\(=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) centred around the direction of the original parton. Near the boundary of the cone, a cell was included in the sum if the position of its centre fell within the required radius.

The total reconstructed energy, \(E^{\rm recon}_{j}\), of the \(j^{\rm th}\) jet in the sample was determined by the equation:

\[E^{\rm recon}_{j}=\sum_{i=1}^{7}a_{i}E^{\rm raw}_{i}\]

where \(E^{\rm raw}_{i}\) is the raw energy deposited in the \(i^{\rm th}\) longitudinal segment of the calorimeter, and \(a_{i}\) is the calibration constant of the \(i^{\rm th}\) longitudinal seg ment. The endcap calorimeter was divided into seven longitudinal segments with segments 1-3 belonging to the electromagnetic endcap calorimeter and segments 4-7 belonging to the hadronic endcap calorimeter.

The calibration constants \(a_{i}\) were determined through minimization of the function:

\[F=\sum_{j=1}^{M}(E_{j}^{\rm recon}-E_{j}^{\rm true})^{2}\]

where there were \(M\) jets in the sample and \(E_{j}^{\rm true}\) was the "true" energy of the jet in the cone at the vertex as explained above.

The minimization procedure was applied in an iterative manner. For the first iteration, the calibration constants were set at an initial guess, and the reconstructed energy \(E_{j}^{\rm recon}\) was calculated for each jet. A gaussian distribution was then fit to the spectrum of \(E_{j}^{\rm recon}-E_{j}^{\rm true}\) giving a standard deviation \(\sigma\). Events with \(|E_{j}^{\rm recon}-E_{j}^{\rm true}|<3\sigma\) were then transferred to the minimization procedure in order to find new calibration constants.

After this initial minimization, the values of \(E_{j}^{\rm recon}\) were recalculated using the new calibration constants and the distribution of \(E_{j}^{\rm recon}-E_{j}^{\rm true}\) was again fit with a gaussian in order to obtain a new width \(\sigma\). Events with \(|E_{j}^{\rm recon}-E_{j}^{\rm true}|<3\sigma\) were again selected and resubmitted to the minimization procedure in order to generate better calibration constants. This procedure was repeated until the \(\sigma\) obtained from the fit to the \(E_{j}^{\rm recon}-E_{j}^{\rm true}\) distribution changed by less than 1% between iterations. The calibration program typically repeated this procedure four times in order to arrive at a stable value of \(\sigma\). These final calibration constants were then applied to the entire data sample less those events for which \(E^{\rm recon}\) was less than 80% of \(E^{\rm true}\). Typically this final set consisted of 90% of the original number of jets. Those jets which had \(E^{\rm recon}\) less than 80% of \(E^{\rm true}\) were due to emission of a hard gluon such that a cone centered on the original parton direction was missedby most of the particles.

Due to the presence of tails in the energy distributions for small cones sizes, the final \(\sigma\) for the energy resolution calculation was given by a gaussian fit in the range of \(-1.5\sigma\) to \(+3\sigma\) to the final \(E_{j}^{\rm recon}-E_{j}^{\rm true}\) distribution. The energy resolution for a given jet energy and cones size was then calculated as this \(\sigma\) divided by the nominal generation energy of the jets.

## 4 Energy Resolution Results

### Exterior Contributions to the Energy Resolution

In the following section, an attempt is made to isolate and measure various contributions to the energy resolution of the jets at the particle level. The effects of the jet shape and particle content as well as the detector material preceeding the calorimeter and magnetic field are studied.

In order to compare the energy in the jet cone at the vertex with the energy in the same cone after the particles of the jet had passed through the detector material preceeding the calorimeters, the subroutine GUSTEP of the DICE program was modified. Using a simulation which included only the inner tracker, the solenoid coil, the endcap cryostat, and with the full magnetic field, the jet particles were stopped at the interface between the cryostat and the electromagnetic endcap calorimeter. The stopped particles were then binned in an array with a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) for further analysis.

#### 4.1.1 Contribution of Muon and Neutrino Content

Previous authors [2] removed the energy contribution of the muons and neutrinos present in the jet when calculating the intrinsic energy resolution of the calorimetry. In this study, the energy deposition due to muons and neutrinoswas measured by stopping them as described in the preceeding paragraph. The measurement of the muon and neutrino energy contribution was performed both at the vertex and the endcap calorimeter face in an attempt to take into account the decay of pions in the detector preceeding the calorimetry. The contribution of neutrinos and muons to the total jet energy is small, on average less than 1%. The rms of the neutrino and muon energy distribution was measured to be 2 GeV for a 75 GeV jet.

#### 4.1.2 Contribution of Inner Tracking, Dead Material, and Magnetic Field

The effect of the tracking and dead material preceding the calorimeter was measured for five dijet transverse energies: 15, 40, 60, 100, and 120 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\). The measurements were repeated for two cones sizes, \(\Delta\)R= 0.5 and 0.7, both centred at \(\eta=2.3\). The average value of the energy lost in the inner tracking and cryostat, including energy that exits the cone, is shown in figure 2 for these five energy points. The rms of the difference between the energy of the jet at the vertex and at the calorimeter face is also plotted in figure 2 for the five energy points. The rise of the rms as a function of the jet energy demonstrates that for jets, the contribution of the material to the energy resolution cannot be included solely in the noise or material term (\(c/E\)). This is due to fluctuations in the number of particles and the specific particle content of each jet as well as to the increase in the average number of particles in a jet as a function of energy. Although the use of single particles would allow the material term to be measured more precisely, pileup and electronic noise will dominate this term in the resolution even at low luminosity as is shown in section 5. Figure 3 shows the contribution of energy loss in the inner detector material and energy leakage from the cone to the energy resolution. The resolution plot is fit with the following equation:\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\,\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus b\,\oplus\frac{c}{E}\]

where \(a\) corresponds to the sampling term, \(b\) the constant term, and \(c\) the material term. The results of this fit are also shown in figure 3. The near zero constant term is expected since the exact energy of the particles in the jet are extracted from GEANT before they enter the calorimeter. What is shown are the fluctuations of the energy exiting the cone or lost in the material. The fit also shows the important contributions of the inner detector material and the cone energy leakage to the sampling term in the case of jets. The effect of the magnetic field alone on the jet energy resolution was found to be negligible.

#### 4.1.3 Jet to Jet Fluctuations

The effects of fluctuations in the multiplicity, energy distribution, and angular scope of the particles comprising a jet on the energy resolution were also considered. In order to measure these effects, the same dijet (formed from the same initial particles) was passed through the detector simulation 500 times with different initial random seeds. This procedure was used to provide two sets of 500 "identical" jets at each of four transverse energies: 15, 40, 60, and 120GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) at \(\eta=2.3\) using GEANT-FLUKA. The calibration and reconstruction of these jets followed the method of section 3. In order to simulate a "typical" jet at each of the above transverse energies, three different "identical" dijets were passed through the detector simulation 500 times each and the final energy resolution taken to be the mean of the three \(\sigma/E\) values obtained from these distributions. Figure 4 shows the average energy resolution of these "identical" jets as compared to the resolution for a set of 500 jets each with different initial particle content. The fit is made Figure 2: The top plot shows the average energy lost in the inner tracking and dead material preceeding the calorimeter as a function of jet energy. This average also includes energy lost due to particles leaving the cone radius. The triangles show results for a cone size of \(\Delta\)R= 0.5 while the circles show results for \(\Delta\)R= 0.7. The rms of the energy lost in the inner tracking and dead material preceeding the calorimeter as a function of the square root of the jet energy is shown in the bottom plot. The rms also includes energy lost due to particles leaving the cone radius. Again, the triangles show results for a cone size of \(\Delta\)R= 0.5 while the circles show results for \(\Delta\)R= 0.7. All cones are centred at \(\eta=2.3\).

Figure 3: The contribution of energy loss in the inner tracking and energy leakage from the cone to the energy resolution of the endcap calorimeter. The solid line shows results for a cone size of \(\Delta\)R=0.5 while the dashed line shows results for \(\Delta\)R=0.7. Both cones are centred at \(\eta=2.3\).

using the material term shown in figure 3 for a \(\Delta\)R=0.7 cone. The results of the fit show that the sampling term receives contributions from the jet fluctuations. It must be kept in mind, however, that both of the curves in figure 4 contain contributions from both material effects and jet to jet fluctuations, and hence the difference in sampling terms between the curves in this figure is not due entirely to jet to jet differences.

### Jet Energy Resolution of the Endcap Calorimeter

In order to facilitate a comparison of the energy resolution results obtained from this study with those of previous studies, the energy resolution of the entire endcap was measured using all energy deposited in the calorimeters between \(\eta=1.5\) and \(\eta=3.2\) in the reconstruction procedure. The "true" jet energy was determined accordingly as the total generator energy at the vertex directed between these two \(\eta\) values. The results of the reconstruction, which followed the procedure of section 3 taking into account three segments of the ENDE and four segments of the ENDH, is shown in figure 5 for GEANT-FLUKA (circles) and for GCALOR (squares). The sampling and constant terms for the whole calorimeter are determined by a fit to the following equation:

\[\frac{\sigma}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus b\]

where \(a\) is the sampling term and \(b\) is the constant term. A summary of the whole calorimeter sampling and constant terms as compared to a previous analysis [10] is given in table 2. Energy resolution curves for cones of size \(\Delta\)R= 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7 are shown in figure 6 for GEANT-FLUKA and GCALOR. The differences in energy resolution observed between jets centered at \(\eta=2.1\), 2.3, and 2.5 is negligible.

obtained for the first electromagnetic calorimeter layer and the first hadronic calorimeter layer using GEANT-FLUKA and GCALOR. As was shown in the previous sections for the energy resolution of jets, a discrepency is observed between the two hadronic transport codes. The fact that GCALOR has lower calibration constants in both calorimeters is due to its higher \(e/h\) ratio (see next section) and because some hadronic energy is also deposited in the electromagnetic calorimeter. The variation of the constants as a function of energy is small for both hadronic transport codes.

Figure 8 displays the average calibration constant for both the electromagnetic and hadronic endcaps for different jet cone sizes. As the cone size increases, the average calibration constant in both the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters decreases due to the fact that less energy escapes from the larger cone.

Figure 9 shows the spectrum of \(E^{\rm true}-E^{\rm recon}\) for 80 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) jets for different cone sizes. For this plot, \(E^{\rm true}\) was taken to be the energy at the vertex directed within the same cone size as was used in the reconstruction. Figure 10 shows the spectra of the same jets but this time \(E^{\rm true}\) is taken to be the energy at the vertex directed within a cone of size \(\Delta\)R= 0.7 for all reconstruction cone sizes. The change in the energy scale as a function of the reconstruction cone size is seen by comparing figures 9 and 10.

The amount of energy in the tails of \(E^{\rm true}-E^{\rm recon}\) distributions when \(E^{\rm true}\) is taken to be the energy at the vertex directed within a \(\Delta\)R= 0.7 cone are shown in figure 11. The fit used to isolate the tails was again an asymmetric gaussian from \(-1.5\sigma\) to \(+3\sigma\). As a reference, a perfect gaussian distribution would have 6.7% of the energy outside of the fitted region.

The results using GEANT-FLUKA are shown by the circles while the results using GCALOR are denoted by the squares. In all cases, the error in the minimization as given by MINUIT is smaller than the data points.

The energy deposited in the whole calorimeter was used in the calibration. The results for GEANT-FLUKA are shown by the circles and the results for GCALOR by the squares. Again, the MINUIT fitting error is smaller than the data points.

Figure 9: Spectra of \(E^{\rm true}-E^{\rm recon}\) for 80 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) jets using the whole endcap calorimeter and three different cone sizes. The value for \(E^{\rm true}\) used was taken to be the vertex energy directed within the same cone size that was used in the reconstruction.

Figure 10: Spectra of \(E^{\rm true}-E^{\rm recon}\) for 80 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) jets using the whole endcap calorimeter and three different cone sizes. The value for \(E^{\rm true}\) used was taken to be the vertex energy directed within a cone of size \(\Delta\)R= 0.7 for all reconstruction cone sizes.

Figure 11: Percentage of energy in the tails of the \(E^{\rm true}-E^{\rm recon}\) distributions for five jet energies and three cone sizes when \(E^{\rm true}\) is taken to be the energy at the vertex directed with a cone of size \(\Delta\)R= 0.7. A perfect gaussian would have 6.7% of its area in the tails as defined in this plot.

### Investigation of Hadronic Code Differences

Understanding the differences in the energy deposition characteristics of various hadronic codes is necessary to allow accurate simulation studies [11]. In order to better understand the observed differences in energy resolution between GCALOR and GEANT-FLUKA, simulations using single particles were performed. The geometry used was a standalone version of GEANT which only included the detailed description of the hadronic calorimeter described previously without any other material present. Figure 12 shows the energy resolution of pions for GEANT-FLUKA and GCALOR as well as for GHEISHA. By simulating electrons at the same energies as the pions, e/\(\pi\) ratios were obtained at several energies as shown in figure 13. From the information in this figure, it is possible to extract the approximate values of \(e/h\) by using the following formula[12]:

\[\frac{e}{\pi}=\frac{e/h}{1-\,<\,F_{em}\,>(1-\,e/h)}\]

where

\[<\,F_{em}>=\,C\,\text{log}(\,E)\]

and \(C\) is a fitted parameter not dependent on \(E\).

This formula gives an approximate \(e/h\) ratio of 1.7 for GHEISHA, 1.35 for GCALOR and 1.1 for GEANT-FLUKA. As expected, the package that generates the lowest e/h ratio gives rise to the best constant term in the energy resolution measurement.

Energy Resolution of Jets in the Presence of Pileup Noise

The effect of minimum bias pileup noise on the energy resolution of jets is considered in this section. For the shaping function used by the liquid argon calorimeters, it has been shown [5][6][7] that the rms of the pileup noise distribution does not vary with the square root of the area but scales as \(A^{0.84}\). Furthermore, it was also shown that there are important longitudinal correlations in the energy deposited by minimum bias events in the calorimetry. A realistic simulation of the effect of pileup noise is therefore particularly important in determining the actual energy resolution of jets and obtaining the best parameters for jet finding algorithms. As was the case with different cone sizes, the jet energy scale will vary depending on the magnitude of the cell level \(E_{\rm T}\) cuts used to remove the pileup noise. The optimization of such cuts must take into account the jet energy, the cone size and, of course, the operating luminosity.

The cell level \(E_{\rm T}\) cuts used in this note were applied using two methods. The first method, referred to in this note as a _tower_ cut, applied a cut to the sum of the energy deposited in all longitudinal samplings contained in a common \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) bin. The second method applied a separate \(E_{\rm T}\) cut to each longitudinal sampling in a tower and is refered to as a _layer_ cut. In the layer cut method, the results of [5] regarding the amount of pileup noise in each longitudinal sampling were used to scale the \(E_{\rm T}\) cut applied to each longitudinal sample. For each 1 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) of layer cut, the individual layer cuts are of magnitude 0.345 GeV, 0.210 GeV, 0.115 GeV, 0.175 GeV, 0.105 GeV, 0.035 GeV, and 0.015 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) respectively for each of the seven longitudinal layers of the endcap calorimeter.

### Pileup Inclusion Method

For the liquid argon calorimeters, the reponse of the shaping electronics to a triangular input pulse lasts for over 500 ns which means that the energy deposition of over 20 bunchcrossings in the calorimetry must be considered for each signal event. For the purposes of this study, the shaping response time was taken to span 24 bunchcrossings. The pileup events used consisted of fully simulated minimum bias events convoluted with the bipolar shaping functions of both endcap calorimeters. Both high and low luminosity pileup events were added to the signal events in order to test the resolution degradation for different luminosity regimes. The high luminosity pileup was generated using a Poisson mean of 23 minimum bias events per bunch crossing (corresponding to a luminosity of 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) with a cross section of 70 mb) while the low luminosity pileup used a mean of 2.3 minimum bias events per bunch crossing (corresponding to a luminosity of 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)). A detailed study of pileup events in the ATLAS calorimetry may be found in [5]. The pileup study presented in this note used only GEANT-FLUKA for both signal and pileup generation.

The pileup noise energy was merged with the jet energy at the readout cell level. The aggregate merged energy of the jets plus pileup noise was then reconstructed using the calibration constants obtained without pileup by the method described in section 3. The final energy resolution in the presence of pileup noise was obtained using the same asymmetrical gaussian fit as for the signal alone. Note that all results with pileup used GEANT-FLUKA for both the jet signal and the minimum bias production.

### Energy Resolution in the Presence of Pileup Noise

The presence of minimum bias pileup noise will severely degrade the energy resolution of the calorimetry in ATLAS. In order to reduce the importance of this noise, cell level transverse energy cuts must be applied. The effect of the cell level cuts on the combined signal and pileup and on the pileup alone may be seen in figure 14. The cut applied in this figure is a 2 GeV \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) layer cut. The pileup after the cut is only shown if the combined energy of the signal plus pileup in that cell passed the cut. It can be seen that most of the pileup contribution is cut while the large core of signal energy in the combined plot remains intact.

Figure 15 shows the energy resolution versus jet energy for signal alone and for signal plus high luminosity pileup using two different values of layer cut in a \(\Delta\)R=0.5 cone. As can be seen from the plot, the higher \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut makes a marked improvement in the energy resolution in the presence of pileup noise.

To obtain the optimal cuts and cones sizes needed to reduce the effects of pileup noise, the 40 and 120 GeV \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets centered at \(\eta=2.3\) were used. The 40 GeV \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets were reconstructed in \(\Delta\)R= 0.3 and 0.5 cones and the 120 GeV \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets were reconstructed in \(\Delta\)R= 0.5 and 0.7 cones. Figure 16 shows the energy resolution for these jet energies and cones sizes versus the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) of layer cut (circles) or \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) of tower cut (squares) which was applied. The best resolution for both the layer cut and tower cut methods occurs for an \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) value of about 1.5 GeV for both jet energies.

For low luminosity pileup noise, the cuts applied to reduce the pileup contribution to the energy resolution need not be so severe. Figure 17 shows the energy resolution of jets alone (circles) and in the presence of low luminosity pileup with a weak layer cut (triangles). As can be seen, the degradation of the resolution is not nearly as important as in the high luminosity case.

In order to test the effect of a change in calorimeter granularity on the jet energy resolution, a new DICE geometry for the hadronic endcap with the granularity changed to \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.2\times 0.2\) at \(\eta>2.4\) was used. This geometry was motivated by plans for the descoping of the hadronic endcap calorimeter. Jets were generated at \(\eta=2.5\) at transverse energies of 40, 60, 80, 100, 120, and 180 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) and at \(\eta=2.8\) at energies of 100, 200, 500, and 800 GeV. The method of reconstruction and calibration was identical to that of section 3. High luminosity pileup was then added to the reconstructed jets in the same manner as in section 5.1. A comparison of the resulting energy resolutions with pileup for the original and modified granularities is shown in figure 18 for different cell level cuts. It can be seen that for a given value of cut, there is very little difference in energy resolution between the two different granularities.

### Jet Scale in the Presence of Pileup Noise

To illustrate how the cuts affect the resolution and scale of the jet signal combined with pileup noise, the spectrum of \(E^{\rm true}-E^{\rm recon}\) for 40 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) (201.5 GeV) jets combined with high luminosity pileup are shown for various tower cuts in figure 19 for a \(\Delta\)R=0.5 cone. The cuts not only affect the width of the distribution, but also the energy scale. The _energy scale factor_ is defined as the nominal generation energy of the jet divided by the peak reconstructed energy. The peak reconstructed energy was determined by the mean of a gaussian fit to the \(E^{\rm recon}\) distribution.

Figure 20 shows the evolution of the jet energy scale as a function of the jet energy in a \(\Delta\)R= 0.5 cone for the signal alone, and for signal combined with high luminosity pileup for different layer cuts. The jet energy scale obtained when pileup is added but no cuts applied is identical to the case without pileup since the bipolar shaping used in the liquid argon calorimeters gives

Figure 18: Energy resolution for jets with high luminosity pileup reconstructed in a \(\Delta\)R= 0.5 cone. Results for the nominal granularity (\(0.1\times 0.1\)) and a modified hadronic endcap granularity (\(0.2\times 0.2\)) are shown. Different tower cuts and layer cuts are applied. The top plot shows the results for jets centered at \(\eta=2.5\) while the bottom plot shows the results for jets centered at \(\eta=2.8\).

an average pileup energy contribution of zero. When the 1 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) layer cut shown in figure 20 is applied, only cells with a mimimum value of "positive energy" are retained and hence the average pileup energy is no longer zero. This causes the reconstructed energy of the jets combined with pileup to go up and hence gives rise to a scale factor lower than one. As the magnitude of the cuts increase, however, more cells containing signal are removed and the reconstructed jet energy begins to go down again, eventually giving jet scale factors higher than one as can be seen for the 2 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) layer cut in figure 20.

The effect of different cone sizes on the jet scale when pileup noise is added was studied using 40 and 120 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) jets. The reconstruction cone sizes used were \(\Delta\)R= 0.3 and 0.5 for the 40 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) jets and \(\Delta\)R= 0.5 and 0.7 for the 120 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) jets. Figure 21 shows the resulting jet scale factors versus the \(E_{\rm T}\) value of the layer cut. The jet energy scale shows less variation for smaller cones because the average energy of the cells within the small cones is higher than for the big cones. For a layer cut of 4 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) (or 2 GeV \(E_{\rm T}\) for the tower cut), the two scale factors for different cones sizes are the same since almost all the peripheral cells which are included in the larger cone but not in the smaller cone are removed by the cut.

## 6 Discussion

The results presented in this note used PYTHIA dijets exclusively. Some of the conclusions might have been different if other types of jets had been considered, especially concerning the jet cone size. In particular, the very high energy forward jets produced in qq\(\rightarrow\)qqH are very collimated and for this case the use of a smaller cone size than proved optimal in this note may be advisable given their relatively low transverse energy.

Figure 20: The jet scale factor for the signal alone and for the signal plus high luminosity pileup with two different values of layer cuts reconstructed in a \(\Delta\)R= 0.5 cone. The jet scale factor is defined as the nominal generation energy of the jets divided by their peak reconstructed energy.

For the calibration of DICE, earlier work by the authors [4] shows that single jets give nearly the same results as dijets as long as the cone size is very large. Therefore, because it is easier to define the nominal energy of single jets, they should be considered for calibration purposes.

Electronic noise was not included in this note since pileup noise dominates at high luminosity. However, this is not the case for low luminosity so the results given here for the latter regime are optimistic.

The jets studied in this note were directed far away from the \(\eta\)=1.5 crack and the \(\eta\)=3.2 crack. Clearly, the energy resolution will be lower in those regions and although work has been done in these areas before, few if any of the effects studied in this note were included.

An important deterioration of the jet energy resolution due to pileup noise has been observed at high luminosity. Here, to reduce the influence of pileup, smaller jet cones and strong cell \(E_{\rm T}\) cuts were used. Other strategies to recover some of the lost resolution might come from the use of zero suppression or optimal filtering [13] in hardware and more sophisticated jet algorithms in software.

The deterioration of the energy resolution due to pileup noise must be taken into account when performing particle level simulations. Also, the choice of a cone size for jet reconstruction must be made by considering both the magnitude of cuts that will be needed to obtain an optimal energy resolution and the proportion of energy in the tails of the reconstructed energy distributions for that cone size.

## 7 Conclusions

In this note, an effort was made to obtain a more realistic estimate of the jet energy resolution of the endcap calorimeters through studying detector effects, estimating the effect of pileup noise, and investigating methods of dealing with the associated loss of resolution.

First, the effect of the material in front of the calorimeter and the fluctuations in the jet event shape were studied. It was shown that the parameterization of the calorimeter resolution for jets receives contributions from both of these effects, especially jet to jet fluctuations which are purely physical and not of instrumental origin.

Second, important differences observed between GCALOR and GEANT-FLUKA were measured for both single particles and jets. The issue of which package to use for the hadronic endcap must be resolved with the analysis of test beam data which should be available at the end of 1996.

Third, an important deterioration of the energy resolution was observed when high luminosity pileup was added to the jets. The use of cell \(E_{\rm T}\) cuts was found to improve the energy resolution. The use of longitudinally changing layer cuts did not appear to reduce pileup noise any better than the more simple tower cuts. This could be due to the existence of longitudinal correlations in the pileup noise as reported in [5]. Finally, the jet energy scale1 in the presence of pileup noise was found to depend on reconstruction cone size, the magnitude of the cell level cuts, and the jet energy.

Footnote 1: The jet energy scale is defined as the nominal generation energy of the jets divided by their peak reconstructed energy. The peak reconstruction energy was taken to be the mean of a gaussian fit to the \(E^{\rm recon}\) distribution.

Future studies using the new DICE geometry must address the issue of providing accurate energy resolution smearing factors for use in particle level and fast simulation studies. The results of this note indicate that important contributions to these smearing factors come from the presence of pileup noise and fluctuations in the particle multiplicity and angular scope of the jets.
