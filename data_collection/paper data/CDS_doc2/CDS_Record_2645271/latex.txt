## 1 Context of the study

The study of the electroweak Vector Boson Scattering (VBS) is an important goal of the LHC physics program, as it gives a direct access to the nature of the electroweak symmetry breaking mechanism, complementary to the study of the BEH boson properties. In this respect, of particular importance, is the study of the longitudinal states scattering of the vector bosons. Another relevant aspect lies in the probe of the non-abelian structure of the Standard Model via the sensitivity tests to triple and quartic gauge couplings.

In proton-proton collisions, VBS results from the interaction of two bosons radiated by the initial quarks and leading to a final state with two bosons and two jets and consists of purely electroweak processes which cannot be separated from other electroweak processes resulting in the same final state. An observation of the electroweak \(WZ\) production exploiting the fully leptonic final states was first presented at the 2018 ICHEP conference [1] using 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 13 TeV. ATLAS has also set limits on anomalous quartic gauge couplings using \(WZ\) final states with Run1 data [2, 3]. The results obtained so far are strongly limited by the available statistics: the increase of luminosity foreseen by the High-Luminosity upgrade of the LHC (HL-LHC) is mandatory to fully exploit the physics potential behind VBS.

The HL-LHC is currently expected to begin operation in the second half of 2026, at the energy of 14 TeV in the centre-of-mass and with a nominal levelled instantaneous luminosity of L = 5-7 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) corresponding roughly to an average number of inelastic pp collisions \(<\mu>\) of 140 to 200 for each beam crossing, and delivering an integrated luminosity of around 250-300 fb\({}^{-1}\) per year of operation. The design target is to collect 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) in 10 years of operation1.

Footnote 1: An ’ultimate’ performance of L = 7.5 x 10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) and 4000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is also under consideration.

To cope with the expected conditions, such as high pile-up, radiation doses and occupancies as well as large data transmission rates, the ATLAS detector will be upgraded. In particular the current Inner Detector will be replaced with an all-silicon Inner Tracker (ITk), which is described in [4] and will extend the tracking capabilities to larger \(\eta\). A forward muon tagger is envisaged to extend the muon acceptance [5]. A new detector, a high granularity timing detector (HGTD) [6] designed to mitigate pile-up effects is also foreseen in the forward region. Finally, the online data acquisition system will be upgraded. This will allow the single lepton trigger threshold to be maintained similar to this of Run2 [7]. The other planned upgrades to the ATLAS detector are described in detail in the Scoping Document [8].

This note concentrates on VBS in \(WZ\) final state with both bosons decaying in channels with electrons and muons. Decays of the \(W\) or \(Z\) via intermediate \(\tau\) leptons decaying leptonically are included in the signal. The note presents the prospects for the measurements at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV at the HL-LHC, of the cross section and the polarisation fractions with the planned upgraded ATLAS detector. In particular it is assumed that it will be possible to identify electrons and muons up to \(|\eta|^{\rm exp}|\) = 4 and likewise to associate jets to the hard-scattering vertex up to \(|\eta|^{\rm jet}|\) = 3.8. Since the topology of electroweakly produced di-bosons events consists of central bosons accompagnied with two high energy forward jets, the analysis benefits fully from this upgrade. The signal events analysed here, are included in the MC sample defined as \(WZ-EW\), the main background \(WZ-QCD\) is represented by events with the same final states but mediated by strong interactions and where the two gauge bosons are not the result of a scattering process.

The main challenge is to discriminate the signal from the \(WZ-QCD\) background. This is achieved here with a standard cut-based event selection and can be improved or supplemented using a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) [9], method which was used in [1].

## 2 Simulation

Signal and background processes are generated at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV and the number of events are scaled to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) as expected for the nominal HL-LHC program. The signal \(WZ-EW\) is simulated at LO using Sherpa 2.2.2 [10]. The dominant background \(WZ-QCD\) as well as \(ZZ-QCD\) are simulated at NLO, while \(ZZ-EW\) is simulated at LO, all using Sherpa 2.2.0. The above samples are generated with the NNPDF30NNLO [11] probability density functions. The other backgrounds considered \(t\bar{t}V\) and \(tZ\) are generated using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [12] interfaced with Pythia8 [13] and use respectively NNPDF23LO [14] and CTEQ6L1 [15] probability density functions.

The studies carried out in this note rely on a fast simulation based on the parametrisation of detector effects [16]. The trigger, reconstruction and identification efficiencies, the energy and transverse momentum resolution of leptons and jets are computed as function of their \(\eta\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) using a full simulation of the ATLAS detector [17] based on GEANT4 [18] and are tabulated in performance functions. The following detector effects are implemented.

* The electron energy and the transverse momentum of muons2 and jets are smeared using a gaussian shape with width values (depending on their \(\eta\) and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) ) as returned by the performance functions. In addition, electrons and muons are dressed with prompt photons laying in a cone of \(\Delta\mathrm{R}\) = 0.1 around the lepton direction, by adding their contributions to the lepton four-momentum. Footnote 2: For muons the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) smearing is done in such a way that it allows for charge-flip.
* Final-state muons, electrons and jets are selected in order to reproduce statistically the reconstruction and identification efficiency measured in full simulation.
* Each final-state muons and electrons is flagged to reproduce statistically the single lepton trigger efficiency. The threshold is set at 24 GeV for electrons and muons.
* Jets from additionnal proton-proton interactions (PU) generated with Pythia8 and with \(<\mu>\) = 200 are added to the event record.
* Fake electrons are introduced according to the probability that a jet fakes an electron as measured in full simulation, where the jet can come from the hard scattering (HS) vertex or from the PU. When a jet is reconstructed as an electron its energy is changed accordingly.
* All jets below 100 GeV and \(|\eta|\) < 3.8 are associated to the HS process depending on a probability based on the charged vertex fraction \(\mathrm{R_{pt}}~{}=~{}\Sigma_{\mathrm{tracks}}\mathrm{p_{T}}/\mathrm{p_{T}^{ \mathrm{jet}}}\). In the following, this procedure is called track-confirmation (TC).
* The particle level missing energy is smeared according to its resolution measured in full simulation also taking into account the mean number of interactions in the event \(<\mu>\).

Comparisons of the results of the fast simulation to the full analysis substantiate this approach. Several declinations of the effects listed above are considered:

**[Nominal]** Leptons are identified up to \(|\eta^{\rm lep}|\) = 4, and TC is used up to \(|\eta^{\rm jet}|\) = 3.8. The probability to misidentify a PU jet as resulting from the HS process is 2%.
**[HGTD]** The simulation uses the same acceptance as above but the performance functions include the effect of the HGTD in the forward region (3.8 < \(|\eta|\) < 2.4). A 4 layer geometry is assumed.
**[High PU rejection]** The PU misidentifcation probability is set at 0.5% at the price of a less good HS jet reconstruction efficiency in the central region. This working point is also used in combination with the HGTD.

Figures 1 to 6 display for the effects described above, the results of different sets of performance functions. In Figures 1 displaying the lepton efficiencies versus \(\rm p_{T}\) and \(\eta\), the expected improvement brought by the HGTD in the forward region on the electron efficiency is visible. Figures 2 indicate that the missing \(\rm E_{T}\) resolution is dominated by the PU effect as hardly no difference can be observed between \(ZZ\) and \(WZ\) final states. As shown in Figures 3, fake electrons represent less than 10% of electrons above a typical cut of 20 GeV used in the analysis; the expected improvement using the HGTD is also visible. The efficiency to associate a jet to the HS vertex is displayed in Figures 4: for \(|\eta^{\rm jet}|\) > 3.8, all jets are associated to the HS vertex and the efficiency is 1. The results of the two PU rejection scenarios are also shown as well as the expected improvement brought by the HGTD in the forward region. Figures 5 represent the distribution of PU jets versus \(\rm p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) associated to the HS vertex: PU jets with \(\rm p_{T}\) > 100 GeV or jets with \(|\eta|\) > 3.8 are all associated to the HS vertex. Finally, Figures 6 represent the fraction of HS jets in \(WZ-EW\) and \(WZ-QCD\) versus \(\rm p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) before selection: jets in \(WZ-QCD\) events are significantly more contaminated by PU jets.

Figure 1: Left: Electrons and muons efficiencies versus \(\rm p_{T}^{\rm lep}\). Right: versus \(\eta^{\rm lep}\) for leptons with \(\rm p_{T}^{\rm lep}\) > 7 GeV and \(|\eta^{\rm lep}|\) < 4. The improvement obtained by using the HGTD information is visible on the electron performance.

Figure 3: Left: Fraction of prompt electrons with respect to all - including fakes versus \(\rm p_{T}^{\rm lep}\). Right: versus \(\eta^{\rm lep}\) for electrons with \(\rm p_{T}^{\rm lep}\)? 7 GeV and \(|\eta^{\rm lep}|\)! 4 in signal events. Above a typical cut in \(\rm p_{T}^{\rm lep}\) at 20 GeV, the fraction of fake electrons is less than 10%. An improvement due to using the HGTD information is visible in the \(\eta^{\rm lep}\) distribution in the forward regions.

In the right figure, several working points mentioned in the Section 2 are represented; above \(|\rm\eta^{jet}|\)? 3.8, every jet is considered as coming from the HS vertex.

## 3 Event selection

The event selection follows the strategy developed for the Run2 analysis [1].

Events with three lepton candidates with \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{\mathrm{lep}}}\) >15 GeV and \(|\eta^{\mathrm{lep}}|\) < 4 are selected. At least one of the three leptons is required to have \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{\mathrm{lep}}}\) > 25 GeV and it is checked in addition that at least one lepton passes the single lepton trigger. In order to suppress the background from \(ZZ\) processes, events containing a fourth lepton with \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{\mathrm{lep}}}\) > 7 GeV are discarded.

The event must have at least one pair of leptons of the same flavor and opposite charge (SFOC), with an invariant mass that is consistent within 10 GeV with the nominal \(Z\) boson mass, \(M_{Z}\) = 91.188 GeV. This pair is considered as a \(Z\) boson candidate. If more than one pair is found, the pair whose invariant mass is closest to the nominal \(Z\) boson mass is taken as the \(Z\) boson candidate.

The third lepton is assigned to the \(W\) boson. It is required to satisfy more stringent criteria than those required for the leptons attributed to the \(Z\) boson: the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) threshold for this lepton is increased to 20 GeV.

Finally, the transverse mass of the \(W\) candidate (\(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\)) computed using the missing energy of the event (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\)) and the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) of the third lepton is required to be above 30 GeV.

The above selection will be referred as the \(WZ\) inclusive selection. To select \(WZ-EW\) events, additional criteria are applied.

At least, two jets with \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{\mathrm{jet}}}\) > 30 GeV, laying into opposite detector hemisphere and with an invariant mass \(\mathrm{M_{jj}}\) greater than 200 GeV are required. This last cut is used to suppress the triboson events contribution present in the simulation of signal events. If there are more than one jet pair, the one with highest \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) jets is chosen. This step will be referred as the VBS preselection.

The final selection requires an additional cut on the invariant mass \(\mathrm{M_{jj}}\) greater than typically 500 GeV. This is also the benchmark prescription for the Yellow Report (YR) on HE/HL-LHC physics (Section 4.3). Alternatively a BDT-based selection is developed and is presented in the section 5. The event selection is summarised in Table 1.

## 4 **Comparitive studies between Run2 and HL-LHC setups**

In order to be able to compare the performance of an upgraded detector with the current version of the ATLAS detector, the analysis was performed using the same event generation, the same level of PU and the expected luminosity for the HL-LHC phase but emulating the Run2 geometrical extension and detector set-up [19]. To draw this comparison, the standard cut on \(\mathrm{M_{jj}}\) > 500 GeV is applied for the final selection.

### **Emulating the ATLAS Run 2 setup**

Electrons and muons are identified within \(|\eta^{\mathrm{lep}}|\) < 2.5. Similarly, TC is valid up to \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet}}|\) < 2.5. The Run2 analysis uses jets up to \(|\eta^{\mathrm{jet}}|\) < 4.5 but this selection is not optimised for the level of pile-up expected at

HL-LHC 3. Therefore, several optimisations varying the jet \(\eta\) or \(\rm p_{T}\) cut were performed for a standard \(\rm M_{jj}\) cut in the range from 500 GeV to 600 GeV: the optimisation is performed to maximize the criterion \(\rm S/\sqrt{S+B}\). To illustrate the method, in Figures 7, the optimisation is performed versus a cut on \(\eta\) of the jets. Curves resulting from different preselection cuts on \(\rm p_{T}\) and \(\rm M_{jj}\) are also shown: while changing the cut on \(\rm M_{jj}\) has a marginal effect, increasing the \(\rm p_{T}\) cut leads to a significant improvement. Keeping the full acceptance (\(|\eta|^{\rm jet}|<4.5\)), the optimised cut on \(\rm p_{T}\) is found to be high - 70 GeV - as shown in Figures 8. If the optimisation is done in 2 dimensions (\(\rm p_{T}^{jet}\) and \(\eta^{jet}\)) as shown in Figure 9 left : the \(\rm p_{T}\) cut obtained in this case is not significantly lower than the one found in the case mentionned above.

Footnote 3: In the current Run2 analysis, cuts are also placed on the angle in space between the leptons and between jets and leptons; since they do not modify significantly the conclusions, they are not applied here for the sake of simplicity.

Since, one of the objective of HL-LHC is to measure and interpret differential distributions, it is felt that maximizing the phase space with keeping the \(\rm p_{T}\) cut as low as possible is preferable. Therefore a preferred optimisation consists in varying the \(\rm p_{T}\) cut for jets with \(|\eta|^{\rm jet}|>2.5\), keeping the \(\rm p_{T}\) cut at 30 GeV for jets with \(|\eta|^{\rm jet}|<2.5\). This latter option gives a good compromise with 4% more events than in the bare 2D optimisation for a \(\rm p_{T}\) cut raised at 75 GeV in the forward region (Figure 9 right ). Subsequent comparisons will be done with respect to this latest option.

### Optimal fiducial phase-space for the ATLAS phase II setup.

In Table 2, the results of the optimised version of the analysis using the Run2 setup described in section 4.1 (column 1) are compared to those corresponding to the HL-LHC setup, where jets are selected up to \(|\eta^{\rm jet}|<4.5\) (column 2). A gain of 60% in signal is observed at the expense of a large increase of \(WZ-QCD\) background as it becomes likely to pick-up a PU jet. Consequently, \(\rm S/\sqrt{S+B}\) is significantly worse. This drawback can be mitigated by applying a tighter \(\rm p_{T}\) cut (80 GeV) for jets with \(|\eta|^{\rm jet}|>3.8\) (column 3): the signal gain is then reduced by 30% and is only marginally greater compared with restricting the jet acceptance to \(|\eta^{\rm jet}|\) less than 3.8 (last column).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \hline  & Run2 optimised & \multicolumn{3}{c|}{HL-LHC} \\  & \(\rm p_{T}>30\) for \(|\eta|<2.5\) & \(\rm p_{T}>30\) GeV & \(\rm p_{T}>30\) for \(|\eta|<3.8\) & \(\rm p_{T}>30\) GeV \\  & \(\rm p_{T}>75\) GeV for \(|\eta|>2.5\) & \(|\eta|<4.5\) & \(\rm p_{T}>80\) GeV for \(|\eta|>3.8\) & \(|\eta|<3.8\) \\ \hline \(WZ-EW\) & 3092 & 4942 & 3981 & 3889 \\ \(WZ-QCD\) & 19618 & 93985 & 30613 & 29754 \\ \(ZZ\) & 1671 & 6654 & 2029 & 1970 \\ \(t\bar{t}V\) & 2830 & 4563 & 3189 & 3145 \\ \(tZ\) & 1848 & 3190 & 2319 & 2221 \\ \hline Total & 25967 & 108393 & 38150 & 37089 \\ \hline \(\rm S/\sqrt{S+B}\) & 18.1 & 14.7 & 19.4 & 19.2 \\ S/(S+B) \% & 11 & 4 & 9 & 9 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Comparison of the Run 2 optimised selection - with 2 \(\rm p_{T}\) cuts - in the first column with several options at HL-LHC (discussion in the text). The cut on \(\rm M_{jj}\) is 500 GeV in all cases.

Figure 8: Left: Distribution of the subleading jet \(\rm p_{T}\). Right: Evolution of \(\rm S/\sqrt{S+B}\) versus the cut on the subleading of jet \(\rm p_{T}\).

Therefore, the nominal fiducial phase-space in the rest of note is limited to \(|\eta^{\rm jet}|\) < 3.8 and the results are presented in Table 2 (last column).

### Yellow Report recommended selection

For the sake of comparisons with other channels and theoretical projections for the Yellow Report, common cuts were defined and are listed below and in Table 1. They modify the VBS preselection.

* Leptons: \(|\eta^{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm{\rm\rm{\rm\rm{ \rm\rm\rm{ \rm\rm }}}}}}}}}}}}}}|<3.0\)
* Jets: \(\rm{p_{T}^{jet}}\)? 30 GeV for \(|\eta^{\rm jet}|\) < 3.8, \(\rm{p_{T}^{jet}}\)? 50 GeV otherwise. \(|\delta\eta_{\rm jj}|>2.5\) M\({}_{\rm jj}\)? 500 GeV

The other cuts are kept identical. The resulting event yield of events are presented in the last two columns of Table 3 for the nominal version and for the option where the jet acceptance is restricted to \(|\eta^{\rm jet}|\) = 3.8. It can be observed again that enlarging the jet acceptance increases the \(WZ-QCD\) background as it becomes more likely to pick-up a PU jet.

### Variations around the nominal ATLAS phase II layout

Along with an extended tracker, a HGTD, covering the high \(\eta\) region is under study: the implications of this new detector for the \(WZ-EW\) signal are presented in the subsection 4.4.1. In subsection 4.4.2, a restricted acceptance affecting the muon identification is also considered.

#### 4.4.1 HGTD and high PU rejection working point.

As the HGTD primary goal is to palliate the nuisance due to PU jets, its impact was estimated in the two scenarios mentioned in Section 2 corresponding to the different level of PU rejection in the nominal phase-space (\(\eta^{\rm jet}\) < 3.8, \(\rm{p_{T}^{jet}}\)? 30 GeV) and \(\rm{M_{jj}}\)? 500 GeV. This is summarised in Table 3. The HGTD improves slightly \(\rm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\) in the "nominal" PU configuration: the number of signal events is increased by 3.7%, while the number \(WZ-QCD\) events is increased by 5.1%, roughly half of the gain being due to the gain in electron efficiency shown in Figure 1. However, considering the working point with a high PU rejection, the gain using the HGTD is more significant as the number of signal events is increased by 11% and the \(WZ-QCD\) background by 13%. Additionally, \(\rm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\) is improved.

Figures 10 enlighten where the gain in efficiency is localised in terms of \(\eta^{\rm jet}\) when the HGTD information is taken into account. It can then be noticed that the gain is provided by the sub-leading jet.

#### 4.4.2 Muon acceptance restricted to \(|\eta|\) < 2.7.

Considering that a muon tagger efficient up to \(|\eta|\) = 4 might not be available at the beginning of the HL-LHC phase, the implication of a muon identification acceptance limited with the New Small Wheel [20] to the region up to \(|\eta|\) = 2.7, was studied; the results are presented in the first column of the summary Table 3. In total, \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\) is only marginally worse thanks to a sizeable reduction of the \(WZ-QCD\) background. In addition, it was also found that \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\) is maximum in the nominal case, ie when the lepton acceptance goes up to \(|\eta|\) = 4 for both electrons and muons.

### Origin of jets

The final state of a VBS process is characterised by to two high \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) quark jet preferentially in the forward regions. It is therefore important to differentiate them from gluon jets and from PU jets given the context of HL-LHC. Table 4 gives the fraction of events with at least one PU jets selected as one of the 2 jets after the final selection. For the signal and the main background, one can see the improvement brought by the extended tracker and the ability to associate jets to the HS vertex permitting to keep the jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) cut as low as 30 \(\mathrm{GeV}\) up to \(|\eta|^{\mathrm{jet}}|\) < 3.8.

Additionally, as shown in Figure 11, the parton origin of the sub-leading jet is for 45% of cases a gluon, while jets in signal events are issued preferentially from u or d quarks: an efficient quark/gluon tagger, primarily applied on the sub-leading jet could help to further reduce the \(WZ-QCD\) background. This observation triggered several studies based on the full simulation - using HGTD, using multivariate

## 5 BDT based analysis and optimal \(\mathbf{M_{jj}}\) selection

A multivariate analysis (BDT) was developped to improve the signal and background separation. Only \(WZ-QCD\) background was considered in the training as it is by far the largest contribution and only distinguishable by kinematics while an anti-b tagging can be used to reduce most of the other type of backgrounds.

Figure 10: Left: Ratio of the number of events selected using HGTD information to the number of events selected without as function of \(|\eta|\) of the leading and sub-leading jet for the nominal working point. Right: for the high PU rejection working point. The lines at \(\eta^{\rm jet}\) = 2.4 materialise the boundaries of the HGTD.

From a set of variables based on jets and leptons kinematics, the 25 best variables given by default by the TMVA package [9] are chosen and they are displayed in Appendix A. The improvement brought by an additionnal variable is not visible. For the training, 40000 signal events, with PU jets but without fake electrons are used and 20000 \(WZ-QCD\) events, after the VBS preselection. Events are used unweighted. Two separate BDTs were trained on simulated events with and without HGTD.

Figures 12 compare the performance of a BDT cut with the classical \(\mathrm{M_{jj}}\) cut and in the right figure, it is quantified the relative gain in efficiency on the \(WZ-EW\) signal using a BDT cut for a given \(WZ-QCD\) background rejection: the gain in signal efficiency is larger for higher rejection working point.

Figure 13 left displays the distribution of \(\mathrm{M_{jj}}\) after the VBS preselection. In the Figure 13 right, the evolution of \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\) is shown as well as this of \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{B}}\). An equivalent content is displayed in Figures 14 for the BDT distribution.

The maximum of \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\) = 19.4 for the cut based analysis is obtained with a cut at \(\mathrm{M_{jj}}\) greater than 600  while the maximum of \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\) = 22.1 for the BDT based analysis is obtained with a cut at 0.44. Relevant numbers are gathered in Table 5. Typically for the same \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\), the BDT based analysis gives 40% more events and for the same signal efficiency, a signal purity 27% better.

## 6 Systematics

Sources of systematics on the signal cross-section arise from the theoretical modelling of \(WZ-QCD\) and \(WZ-EW\) events and from experimental effects. In the 13 TeV VBS analysis [1], the detailed study of uncertainties shows that the former amounts in total to 7.3% ; the latter is by far dominated by the jet related uncertainties and amounts to 6.6%.

Following the recommandations given in [16] and [21], the jet energy scale was varied within 2.5% and jet energy resolution within 15%, leading respectively to a 2% and less that 1% systematic on the signal yield.

Given the signal over background ratio of the order of 1 to 10, the signal significance is limited by the uncertainty on the background as it is shown in Figure 15, and in particular by the theoretical uncertainty associated to the \(WZ-QCD\) background of currently 5.8%. The projected experimental uncertainty from the jet related uncertainties amounts to 3.9%. However, it is expected that the background uncertainty can be controlled to a smaller value thanks to refined and diverse control regions, allowed by the larger number of background events. Figure 15 displays two scenarios in addition to the nominal one, where the signal significance is enhanced thanks to a better background rejection obtained either by the BDT explained in Section 5 or by applying a q/g discrimant on the jets: with an increased signal over background ratio, the systematic uncertainty on the background is less critical.

## 7 Recap of the main conclusions of the comparative studies.

Figure 16 summarises the event yield vs the optimisation criterion \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\) for the different working points presented in the text.

The extended tracker setup brings 28% more signal events with an associated \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\) more favorable. Within its acceptance, it also allows to maintain the jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) cut as low as 30 GeV despite the large background from pile-up events. Though, the expected level of PU precludes considering jets in the full detector acceptance, unless a high \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{jet}}\) cut of the order of 80 GeV for \(|\eta|^{\mathrm{jet}}>3.8\) is used. This in addition with a less extended \(|\eta|\) range for leptons, makes the YR recommended selection non optimal for the ATLAS Phase II detector.

With the performance assumptions simulated by the HGTD performance function, an additional signal gain of 4% is brought by the HGTD detector. In the case where a high PU rejection is needed, the HGTD allows to recover the nominal signal efficiency, with a gain of 11%, the gain being brought essentially by the sub-leading jet.

A BDT based selection brings 40% more events for the same \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\) or a purity 27% better for the same signal efficiency than an optimal \(\mathrm{M_{jj}}\) cut at 600 GeV. The optimal BDT cut gives an efficiency loss of 16% but increases the purity by 67% which, in fine, gives a signal significance greater than 5 if \(\sigma_{B}<5\%\). The \(WZ-QCD\) background can also be mitigated by an efficient quark-gluon tagger since the sub-leading jet origin is a gluon in 45% of events.

As the constraint F0+FL+FR = 1 is used, the fitted parameters consist of F0, (FL-FR) and the normalisation.

### Individual polarisation of \(Z\) and \(W\) bosons

In this section, each vector boson is treated independently within the nominal phase-space defined in Section 4.2.

#### 8.2.1 Polarisation studies under no background conditions

Only \(WZ-EW\) signal events are considered and the standard final selection with \(\mathrm{M_{jj}}\) > 600 GeV is used. The distributions of \(\cos\theta_{\mathrm{Z}}^{*}\) and \(\cos\theta_{\mathrm{W}}^{*}\) are fitted with 3 parameters F0, (FL-FR) and the signal normalisation using the three polarisations templates histograms plus the background contribution coming from \(WZ\to\tau X\)5. This latter is normalised to the cross-section and the luminosity, with a 5% systematic error. The result of the fit is displayed in Figures 19 for two distributions. In Figure 20, the intrisic sensitivity to F0 of each channel can be appreciated: as expected the channels are affected either by a smaller statistic when a \(W^{-}\) boson is involved or by a worse resolution due to the reconstruction of the neutrino when a \(W\) boson is involved.

Footnote 5: \(WZ\to\tau X\) events must be treated in this study as an additional background since the \(\tau\) is, de facto, not reconstructed and consequently \(\cos\theta_{\mathrm{Z}}^{*}\) and \(\cos\theta_{\mathrm{W}}^{*}\) are not properly defined

#### 8.2.2 Including the backgrounds

In this section, a more realistic approach is presented as the backgrounds are also considered. For the systematic associated to the total background normalisation, three cases were envisaged: 20%, 5% and 2.5%. For the best and worse channels, \(Z(W^{+})\) and \(W^{-}\), a fit of F0 was performed for several hypothesis affecting the final selection:

* the \(\mathrm{M_{jj}}\) cut was varied from 500 GeV as the YR recommandations to the optimal cut of 600 GeV.
* the optimal BDT cut was applied as well as a more stringent cut
* the effect of q/g tagging on the subleading and leading jets was emulated. The current tagging performance given in [22] extrapolated to the HL-LHC acceptance, due to the large QCD background, are not efficient enough; the test was conducted with a bold scenario where \(\epsilon_{q}\) is 0.9 while \(\epsilon_{g}\) is 0.1.
* Finally the luminosity was doubled to emulate the combination of two experiments.

Significances for F0 ( = \(\sqrt{-2\mathrm{logL(0)}}\) ) for the different hypothesis are presented in Table 6. The precision on the background is a key ingredient to improve the sensitivity on F0 as well as the signal purity for comparable signal significance. Adding a quark/gluon tagger, a gain of 10% on the significance can be achieved but in general, the improvement saturates when the signal statistics becomes too low. In the case of \(W^{-}\), the conclusions are more critical as the sensitivity on F0 barely reaches a significance of 1 \(\sigma\). Examples of the fitted distribution and of the loglikelihood profile are given in Figures 21 for the case enlightened in red in the table.

The \(WZ-EW\) signal purity and the expected number of longitudinally polarised events are also given as additionnal information. The case in red corresponds to Figures 21.

### Double polarisation of the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons

Ultimately, one wants to measure the polarisation component of the \(WZ\) final state as the sum of \(W_{0}Z_{0}\), \(W_{0}Z_{T}\), \(W_{T}Z_{0}\) and \(W_{T}Z_{T}\) components where T stands for transverse polarisation, the sum of the right and left fractions defined in the preceeding section.

The four corresponding templates are obtained in a similar way as in section 8.1, by combining the weights obtained from the analytical fits. Figures 22 illustrate the result of several fits which remain an exercice as the \(WZ-QCD\) background was not taken into account. They show the results of a simultaneous fit of 2 data distributions to 4 data distributions consisting of the distributions of \(\cos\theta_{\mathrm{Z}}^{*}\) and \(\cos\theta_{\mathrm{W}}^{*}\) of the scalar sum of the lepton \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) from the Z boson and the scalar sum of the lepton \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) from the W and \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\). For \(\mathrm{M_{jj}}\) > 500 GeV, with 266 expected doubly longitudinally polarised events, the significance of the fraction of double longitudinally polarised final state stays below 1 \(\sigma\). However, it should be noted that a 2-dimensional fit of \(\cos\theta_{\mathrm{Z}}^{*}\) and \(\cos\theta_{\mathrm{W}}^{*}\) gives a better sensitivity as shown in Figure 22 bottom left. Therefore, more sophisticated methods will be valuable to perform this measurement.

## 9 Kinematic distributions sensitive to aQGCs

In the reference [3], the variables \(\sum\lvert p_{T}^{lep}\rvert\) and \(\lvert\Delta\phi(\mathrm{W},\mathrm{Z})\rvert\) are shown to be sensitive on aQGC with the WZ final states. The distributions of these observables are shown in Figures 23 with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

The sensitive region to aQGC lays at high \(\sum\lvert p_{T}^{lep}\rvert\), typically above 500 GeV: extrapolating from the less than one signal event expected in [3] leads to less than 30 events at the end of Run3, while around 220 are expected with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). Similarly, from 2 events above \(\lvert\phi(\mathrm{W},\mathrm{Z})\rvert\) equal 2.4, around 75 signal events are expected at the end of Run3, while about 950 are expected with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). Additionnal distributions are given in Appendix B.

## 10 Conclusion

Prospects for measuring vector boson scattering in the \(WZ\) fully leptonic final state for HL-LHC are presented using a fast simulation based on the parametrisation of the ATLAS detector effects. Different detector setups and pile-up conditions are studied, extending or not the tracking acceptance with the implications of a lepton and a hard scatterring jet identification up to \(|\eta|\) = 4, including or not the high granularity timing detector and varying the working point for pile-up rejection.

The signal over background ratio is of the order of 1 to 10 and the main background (80%) comes from the strong production of \(WZ\)plus two jets final states. The extension of the tracking capabilities to large \(\eta\) brings 28% more signal events and despite the expected level of PU, enables to maintain a jet \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) cut as low as 30 GeV within the tracker acceptance. Beyond, a more stringent cut on \(\mathrm{p_{T}^{jet}}\), of the order of 80 GeV must be applied. Depending on the level of PU rejection, an additional signal gain, between 4% to 10% can be expected with the addition of HGTD. But for dealing with differential distributions, increasing the signal statistic or purity is important. Therefore, a multivariate analysis was also investigated to separate \(WZ-EW\) events from the \(WZ-QCD\) background. For the same \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{S+B}}\), 40% more events are selected with the BDT. Additionnally, the \(WZ-QCD\) background can be also mitigated by an efficient quark-gluon tagger in particular in the forward region.

Given the low signal over background ratio, the precision on the cross-sections measurement will be hampered by the systematic uncertainty associated to the \(WZ-QCD\) background and in particular by the theoretical uncertainty. However, it is expected that the background uncertainty will be constrained by refined and diverse control regions, allowed thanks to the large amount of statistics.

Investigations were carried out to measure the polarisation fractions of the vector bosons. It was shown that the measurement of the longitudinal polarisation of the \(Z\) bosons is reachable with an expected significance between 2 to 3 standard deviations. In general, the sensivity is increased with a larger signal
