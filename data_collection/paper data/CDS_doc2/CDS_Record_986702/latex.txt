###### Abstract

In this note, electrical measurements performed at the baseplanes of the barrel calorimeter of ATLAS detector are described. From these measurements, the value R\({}_{cal}\) of the calibration injection resistors and the electrical parameters Rcell and LC have been extracted for all channels. The precise knowledge of these parameters is a key issue for an accurate signal reconstruction.

## 1 Introduction

The electromagnetic calorimeter [1] of the ATLAS detector is made of lead absorbers bent to an accordion geometry and immersed in a liquid Argon bath. Between two consecutive absorbers, a three-layer electrode is dividing the gap into two equal parts and plays a twofold role: it distributes the 2000V high voltage through the two external layers and it collects the signal in the inner one.

In the barrel region (pseudorapidity \(\eta\) up to 1.4), a readout electrode is segmented laterally in cells pointing to the interaction point; longitudinally, a cell is separated in 3 parts, front, middle and back with different lateral extensions (0.003x0.1, 0.025x0.025 and 0.050x0.025 in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) respectively). Each cell is electrically equivalent to a capacitor C accross which the signal is built, in series with a connection inductance L, corresponding to the line bringing the signal to the edge. The barrel is constructed in two half-barrel wheels, each one made of 16 modules. A module covers a range of 0\(<\eta<\) 1.4 and of 2\(\pi\)/16 in \(\phi\).

The electromagnetic cascade triggered by a particle traversing the cell induces a triangular signal, slightly distorted by the accordion geometry. After propagation on a minicoaxial cable, the signal goes through the current preamplifier and it is then shaped by a CR-RC2 amplifier. A calibration signal is injected at the motherboard level, downstream of the cell inductance L. As the electrical characteristics determine the shape and the amplitude of physics signals read out from a cell, the precise knowledge of L (inductance), C (capacitance) and R\({}_{cal}\) (calibration resistance), is crucial for an effective calibration and turns out to be mandatory in order to achieve the required energy resolution. Studies have shown that the product LC must be known to better than 1% for each cell to induce less than 0.2% error on energy reconstruction[2]. Similarly, only 0.1% uncertainty is tolerated on R\({}_{\alpha l}\). Moreover, the copper made surface of cells introduces a damping resistance term Rcell, introducing a bias up to 3% in the energy reconstruction if not taken into account.

Cell capacitance measurements give information about the dimensions of a cell and consecutively, would indicate imperfections during module stacking or (and) assembling of the 16 modules to a wheel structure, which would produce swelling or decreasing of a cell gaps.

In this note, measurements of electrical parameters, the used method and the comparison of results with expectations based on the geometry of the detector and the readout chain, are presented.

## 2 Method and data-taking

The two half barrels have been assembled one after the other. When the barrel was completed and the necessary tests done, the detector was inserted into the cryostat and all cells have been electrically connected through the boards and cables to the feedthroughs. A first campain of tests started, to check HV stability, electrical connectivity, noise level etc and to measure LC and R\({}_{cal}\) at room temperature. Once all tests have been completed, the cryostat was hermetically closed, cooled down and filled with liquid Argon at 90\({}^{\circ}\)K. All tests have then been repeated, with the calorimeter at cold. Signals have been readout always at the feedthrough baseplanes.

Electrical measurements have been performed as follows:

* At warm: M Wheel during summer 2003 [3] and P wheel during winter 2004.
* At cold: both wheels during summer 2004.
* The module used for the test beam at Prevessin site underwent the same procedure in 2003 and 2004.

The schematic view of a baseplane is shown in 1. Two feedthroughs are needed to readout a complete module, sharing it in two parts in \(\phi\). The different positions correspond to output signals for the preshower (1 slot), for the front strips (7 slots sharing the strips following \(\eta\)), for the back (2 slots) and for the middle (4 slots) compartments, in addition to one for calibration injection, one for monitor purposes, one for the Tower Builder and one for the Controller.

Dedicated multiplexer boards, called scanners, have been built for these measurements. They are plugged consecutively at each slot and they are controled by a GPIB interface. Their role

Figure 1: Schematic of a baseplane, showing the signal positions in the crate.

is to address the 128 channels of a given baseplane position by automatical switching. Care was taken in their conception to avoid any additionnal L, C in the electrical paths and to have only a small and uniform resistance.

LC measurements have been performed for all channels of the middle calorimeter layer. Signals of back layer have also been recorded. Various methods have been tried to access to LC information at the end of the connection cables without being sensitive to their own parameters. The finally chosen one consists of a 3 points measurement: a known signal is injected at the calibration path of a given cell and the output response is readout. A Network Analyzer (AGILENT) has been used, producing sinusoidal signals covering a large range of frequencies, from few kHz to 300MHz. Such a signal is injected through the calibration channels at 1000 different frequencies. The collected transfer function Vout/Vin corresponds to the resonance curve of the cell.Two scanners are necessary for LC measurements: a first one to command the calibration injection and a second one to readout the signal.

For R\({}_{cal}\) measurement, the scanner addressing the calibration channels is directly connected to a Keitley multimeter.

## 3 Measurement of calibration injection resistance

The calibration signal is injected at the input of the calorimeter on the motherboards through precise calibration injection resistive networks designed with an 0.1 % absolute tolerance [12]. The precision of the ATLAS calorimeter is directly related to the accuracy of these resistors. During the production and tests of the modules of the barrel calorimeter, it has been observed that these resistors might be damaged when a HV discharge occured in the calorimeter. To minimize the potential damage, the motherboards have been equipped by additional protection diodes [4] but not replaced on the modules already tested. Moreover for the front layer, it was not possible to include this protection scheme due to not enough free space1. Therefore it has been decided to perform a survey of all the resistances values at different stages of the calorimeter building.

Footnote 1: As the detector capacitance is smaller in the front layer, the energy released by a fast HV discharge should have less impact on the resistors.

Figure 2: Scheme of calibration board injection in the calorimeter

### Measurement method and limitation

A scheme of the calibration injection is presented on the Figure 2. The voltage calibration signal provided by the calibration board [5] through 50 Ohm cables terminated is distributed on the motherboard though injection calibration resistor (\(R_{cal}=R_{inj}+R_{damp}\)). In order to reduce the sensitivity to the cable impedance, the signal should be 50 \(\Omega\) terminated at both ends. Such an adjustment is guaranteed by the value of the resistor \(R_{term}\) which is parallel to the injection network.2 Two measurements can be perfomed to extract these parameters :

Footnote 2: While the signal injected is directly proportional to V/\(R_{cal}\), the sensitivity to the termination is to first order only (1-(dr/50)2) where dr is the mismatch.

* From a signal slot as shown in Figure 1 and if all other slots are opened, the combination (\(R_{inj}+R_{damp}+R_{term}\)) is measured between the signal pin and the ground.
* From the calibration slot \(R_{term}\) is measured between the ground and the signal pin.

On each slot a multiplexer board (128\(\rightarrow\)1) is used and the output signal measured with a Keitley multimeter to achieve the required accuracy. Both are driven by a GPIB system. The DC uniformity of the board has been measured with a r.m.s of 17 \(m\Omega\) (Figure 3). Only the average value have been surtracted from the measurements. The stability and measurement reproducibility has also been studied : the same feedtrough has been measured before and after a beam test period : a 0.03 % dispersion is obtained.

As the measurement is performed only at the level of the baseplane, the cable can also contribute to the measurement. Figure 4 shows at warm and argon temperature the resistance of the strip layer, averaged over an half barrel calorimeter as a function of the strip number. The cable length changes every 64 channels. At warm a small decrease of the resistance as a function of the strip number is observed compatible with the expected 0.53\(\Omega\)/m cable dc resistance3. At cold due to the reduction of the copper resistivity, the variation of the cable is negligible. The structure observed inside a group of 64 channels is associated to the signal routing on the motherboard.

### Results

This section summarizes the measurements of the whole barrel calorimeter done at warm and then at cold after the High Voltage tests.

#### 3.2.1 Presampler

Measurements at warm and at cold of R\({}_{cal}\) are shown in figures 30 and 31 for wheels M and and P respectively 4. No dead channel has been observed. The dispersion is smaller at warm (0.05%) although the cable dependance along \(\eta\) is clearly visible. At cold the dispersion remains within the requirements, smaller than 0.1%. The resistance variation with temperature has been extracted from the ratio and found to be -14 ppm/degree. At warm, feed through 19 in the P wheel shows a larger resistance by about 2 \(\Omega\) which was not reproduced during the measurement with liquid argon. A few channels (10, that is to say 0.12 % of presampler barrel channels) have a resistance which differs by more than 0.5 % of the average at cold and are summarized in the table 1. While some can be considered as the tails of the distribution, module M15 (feedthrough 11) has 7 channels outside this window : this might result from a High Voltage damage during the cold test, since nothing similar was detected at warm. The two pathological channels in M6 were already off by 10\(\Omega\) at warm.

Footnote 4: The measurements for one crate are missing at warm.

Figure 4: Resistance \((R_{inj}+R_{damp}+R_{term})\) as a function of the strip number averaged in \(\phi\) over an half calorimeter The vertical lines correspond to regions with different cable lengths, respectively 4.41m, 4.16m, 3.81m, 3.47m, 3.10m, 2.66m and 2.18m.

#### 3.2.2 Strips layer

Measurements at warm and at cold of R\({}_{cal}\) are summarized in figures 32 and 33 respectively for wheels M and and P 5. As for the presampler the dispersion is worse by about 50 % at cold but remains smaller than 0.1 %. The resistance variation, about -100 ppm/degree, explains the 2\(\Omega\) variation between the measurements at warm of M and P wheels. One peculiar feedthrough (FT4, M wheel) exhibits a lot of resistances outside the expected accuracy, only at cold. The example of one slot position is shown on Figure 5 : while at warm, before and after the cold test no problem is observed, at cold with the current setup an effet is observed both with and without Argon. However when using low current setting on the Keithley6, the problem seems to disappear. Also for these channels and a few others, all located in the strip section of the calorimeter at cold, the measurement is stable only after a very long period, as shown in 5.

Footnote 5: The measurements for one crate and of one more slot are missing at warm

Footnote 6: The current setup was using automatically 10 k\(\Omega\), 1 mA but it can be forced to use 100 k\(\Omega\) 100\(\mu\)A. With this setting the sensibility to the noise environment induces a deterioration of the measurement accuracy

No good explanation has been found nor the impact when calibrating the calorimeter. A careful follow-up of the calibration signals of this feedthrough will be mandatory during the commissioning of the calorimeter.The channels which have a resistance differing by more than 0.5 % of the average at cold are summarized in the tables 2 and 3.

#### 3.2.3 Middle layer

Measurements of R\({}_{cal}\) at warm and at cold are summarized in figures 34, 35, 36 and 37 for wheels M and P respectively 7 and separately for A and B electrodes. Similar conclusions as for the strip section can be drawn : larger but acceptable dispersion at cold but with a quite enhanced non uniformity as a function of \(\phi\). In the electrode A, one slot in module P14 (FT28)

which contains one channel with a short, shows larger resistances for all channels by at least 0.3%. Similar observation can be done also for one slot in P12 (FT24) in electrode B. The channels outside \(\pm\)0.5% are summarized in Tables 4 and 5.

#### 3.2.4 Back layer

Measurements at warm and at cold of R\({}_{cal}\) are summarized in figure 38 and 39 respectively for wheels M and and P.

#### 3.2.5 Barrel end

The barrel end channels are read out from the front face of the calorimeter. As for the strip layer they are not protected by diodes against High Voltage discharge and their large detector capacitance made them more sensitive to. At warm, already 11 channels out of the 2048 channels were damaged. At cold, after some new HV tests, a total of 17 damaged channels have been found and they are listed in table 7. In the ATLAS pit in order to cure the HV shorts, some burning tests have been applied to a few modules : while the HV short might be repaired, a few calibration resistors, not protected by diodes, have been damaged especially in the barrel end as described in [11].

#### 3.2.6 Calibration termination

The calibration termination resistances are measured directly through the calibration slot and summarized in figures 40 and 41. A small structure is observed as a function of the feedthough number and could be attributed to contact resistance in the setup. The channel 61 in the module P4 (FT 9) is opened. Combining the measurements at cold, the calibration is found in average terminated to 50.4,50.6 and 49.9 \(\Omega\) respectively in the strip, middle electrode A and middle electrode B layers.

## 4 LC measurements

### Electronic description of a readout cell

Schematicaly, a readout cell is an rLC circuit connected to the calibration injection and to the readout. With the SIMetrix simulation package, one can explore the influence of the different components on the output signal. Figure 6 gives the drawing of a cell simulation.

Figure 6: Schematic of a cell, as it is used in SIMETRIX simulation.

The left part represents the calibration circuit: the signal injection is done through the scanner (represented by the impedance R1=50\(\Omega\)) plugged on the feedthrough, modelized here as a 33\(\Omega\) cable 5ns long; then follows the cable (shown as a 50\(\Omega\) cable 25ns long) bringing the signal to the motherboards where the calibration resistance (R5=R\({}_{cal}\)=1k\(\Omega\) for A and 500\(\Omega\) for B electrodes respectively) is plugged. Then the injected signal "sees" the detector as an rLC circuit, represented in the drawing by a 300m\(\Omega\) resistance (R4=Rcell=damping resistance) in series with an 40nH inductance and a 800pF capacitance. Then it goes through the 25 Ohms and 22ns long signal cables back to the feedthrough, as shown at the right part of the schematics. Finally, the signal is readout through the second scanner (modelized by an impedance of 33 Ohms). Notice two simplifications comparing to reality : harness and pigtail are merged to a single signal cable 22ns long. Similarly, the feedthrough length of 5ns is a merge of vacuum and warm cables.

Simulation allowed to study the signal dependance on several factors, summarized here:

* The output signal corresponds to the resonance curve for a rLC circuit, with a frequency, \(\omega_{0}\), determined by the LC value of the cell. Outside the resonance region, the signal shape is sensitive to the impedance termination of the signal output: because signal cables have a characteristic impedance of 25\(\Omega\) and the feedthrough cables of 33\(\Omega\) a partial reflection takes place. This doesn't affect significantly the resonance position but it causes wiggles appearing at lower and higher frequencies. The period between wiggles depends on the cable length. An imperfect matching on the calibration has almost no effect on the signal shape, because the corresponding cable is adapted at both ends. To reduce reflections, the scanner reading the output signal was terminated 33\(\Omega\) in order to match the feedthrough impedance. In figure 7 one can compare a resonance curve in case of perfect (in green) and close to real (in red) termination.
* For \(\omega\to\)0, V\({}_{out}\)/V\({}_{in}\)=R\({}_{T}\)/R\({}_{cal}\), so the output signal is inversely proportional to the calibration resistance and proportional to R\({}_{T}\), a combination of the two termination impedances, at both, calibration and signal sides. Figure 8, left, shows shape variation with R\({}_{cal}\) (in

red) and termination (in blue). Again, the resonance frequency remains unchanged (figure 8 right).
* For \(\omega=\omega_{0}\) V\({}_{out}\)/V\({}_{in}\)=r/R\({}_{cal}\) (r=R4 in the drowing). At resonance, the signal amplitude is related to the resistance of the cell and inversely depending on R\({}_{cal}\).

### Geometrical simulation of LC for the middle barrel compartment

The electrical parameter LC of a cell is mostly determined by its geometry. All electrodes are identical by construction, and the lead plates uniform within 1%. Cells are etched on the electrodes, pointing to the interaction region. The end of the middle section was fixed to 23X\({}_{0}\). Hence the capacitance value of cells is almost constant, except at \(\eta\)=0.8 where the transition to thinner lead plates induces a 30% capacitance increase. Figure 9 shows length and width of middle compartment cells versus their position following pseudorapidity \(\eta\). The cell width varies between 43 and 52mm and the length between 400 and 700mm, corresponding to a propagation delay of 2 to 2.7ns.

The most accurate modelization of one cell is a transmission line model: the signal is the conductor on the kapton, the dielectric the liquid argon and the absorber is the return ground. A line is characterized by two parameters, either its capacitance C and inductance L or its impedance Z and its propagation time t\({}_{d}\). These quantities are related through the usual equations;

\[\mbox{t}_{d}\mbox{=}\sqrt{LC}\hskip 56.905512pt\mbox{Z}_{c}\mbox{=}\sqrt{L/C}\]

Figure 8: Output signal (in green). For the blue curve, the termination has changed and in red the case with half calibration resistance value is shown. Figure at right shows that resonance position is the same for all cases. In principle, one can extract all electrical parameters r, L and C fitting the resonance curve.

Propagation velocity depends only on the dielectric medium: v=c/\(\sqrt{\epsilon_{r}}\). Together with the cell capacitance, the capacitance of the connection line to the readout endpoint at the back of the electrode, has to be taken into account as well. In addition, along this way, cross-talk with back cells and neighbour lines takes place, inducing capacitance as well. Kapton electrodes slightly differ from a pure transmission line model, because of the close presence of neighbouring electrodes and the construction of the signal conductor (made of three 35\(\mu\)m copper layers- 2 high voltage and one signal-separated by 80\(\mu\)m kapton). The electrodes should therefore be considered as coupled transmission lines with characteristics that can be extracted solving Poisson's equation with finite element analysis using a finite element code like PRIAM [7]. This method allows to extract the capacitance to ground \(C_{G}\) and to the neighbouring cell (cross-talk) \(C_{X}\). The results are:

\(C_{G}\)=4\(\times\)(9.814+8.421\(\times\)W) pF/m, capacitance to ground for a bi-gap per metre

\(C_{X}\)=2\(\times\)4\(\times\)13.19 pF/m, cross-talk capacitance to one neighbour per metre

where the factor 4 counts for the four gaps which are ganged together in \(\phi\) to form a cell. The factor 2 in \(C_{X}\) takes into account of the cross talk from one cell to its two, left and right, neighbours.

The capacitance to ground formula has two terms, one constant and a linearly varying with the cell width W. It is interesting to notice that the linear term corresponds to the case of a plane capacitor: C=2\(\epsilon_{r}\epsilon_{0}\)W(mm)/gap =8.421 W(mm) pF/l(mm) where the factor 2 stands for the bi-gap, \(\epsilon_{r}\)=1 at warm and gap=2.1mm. The constant terms of C\({}_{G}\) and C\({}_{X}\) represent edge effects and they are sensitive to the thickness of the electrode. Here C\({}_{X}\) is computed for a cell with the four electrodes (in \(\phi\)) in parallel, for a 1mm spacing between neighbours and 0.25mm further recessing for the signal pad. Also, only 55% (59%) of the cross-talk lines are joining the two cells going through the gap at warm (cold), the rest going through the capton.

Figure 9: Drawing of a barrel electrode.

#### 4.2.1 Other sources of capacitance

Along our studies, we have been convinced about other sources of small capacitance contributions.

* At the back of the electrode, the connection lines are crossing the HV distibution band. The induced capacitive cross-talk, quoted C\({}_{HV}\), is proportional to the cross-section between the lines. We measured the corresponding numbers on a given electrode and found a contribution of 10-40pF depending on \(\eta\).
* From construction, the electrode has a blocking capacitance \(\approx\)100 times bigger than the gap capacitance, quoted C\({}_{BC}\). Because this capacitance is in parallel with C\({}_{G}\), its final effect on the total capacitance is small and varies slightly with \(\eta\).
* The readout summing and motherboards might a priori have their own capacitances that would be seen by our resonance measurement. It turns out that only the low impedance summing board contributes with a capacitance varying with \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) from 40-80 pF, quoted C\({}_{SB}\). The signal lines on the motherboard have a capacitance of 70 pF to which our measurement is not sensitive, since the 15\(\Omega\) line's impedance is very close to that of the signal cables.

Two other effects are slightly modifying the plane capacitor model.

* The accordion geometry distords the field around the corners. A detailed GEANT 4 simulation of the field map in a real cell showed that, in average, the capacitance is 95\(\pm\)2% of the plane gap case [8].
* A light honey-comb structure fills 75\(\pm\)10% (called V\({}_{hc}\)) of the cell surface that might increase the capacitance. A quantitative measurement has been done using a test-cell frame, made of two parallel planes kept at a distance of 2mm. Inserting a honey-comb band in the gap induces a capacitance increase by 2%. The density of the used honey-comb material is 40Kg/m\({}^{3}\) which corresponds to an \(\epsilon_{r}\) of 1.5.

Therefore, at air temperature we have:

\[\mbox{C}_{total}^{warm}\!\!=\!\![(\mbox{C}_{G}^{warm}\!\!+\!\mbox{C}_{X}^{warm })\!\times\!(\mbox{V}_{hc}\!\times\!1.02\!+\!1\mbox{-V}_{hc})\!\!\parallel\! \mbox{C}_{BC}]\,+\,\mbox{C}_{HV}^{warm}\!\!+\!\mbox{C}_{SB}^{warm}\!\!(\mbox{pF})\]

where

* C\({}_{G}^{warm}\) stands for both cell and connections capacitance to ground at warm. Similarly, C\({}_{X}^{warm}\) stands for cell-to-cell, cell-to-connection and connection-to-connection cross-talk at warm. Both terms here are taking into account of cells or (and) connections lengths.
* Seventy five per cent (=V\({}_{hc}\)) of ground and cross-talk capacitance has been increased by 2% to take into account of the honey-comb presence in a gap.
* C\({}_{G}\) and C\({}_{X}\) contributions have been put in parallel with the blocking capacitance.

Figure 10 left, shows the expected middle compartment capacitance as a function of \(\eta\). The different sub-components are indicated, cell capacitance, cell-to-cell cross-talk, connection line, and connection-to-connection cross-talk. A total of 800pF to 1.2nF depending on \(\eta\) is the geometrical capacitance of the middle in the barrel. In figure 10 right the expected capacitance for middle cells is compared with measurements done with an impedance-meter on the summing boards of few modules before being assembled in the barrel. These values were extracted by fitting the imaginary part of the impedance.The agreement is quite reasonable and it is well within the 40pF uncertainty due to the measurement technique.

### Capacitance in liquid argon

The immersion of the barrel into the liquid argon bath changes the dielectric constant of the cell gap, following the formula :

\(\epsilon_{r}\)(T)=1.2408+0.0068755\(\times\)T-0.45344e-4\(\times\)T\({}^{2}\) where T is in Kelvin.

For instance, the capacitance to ground increases by 1.4941 at T=88K. However, other contributions to the total capacitance are differently modified at cold, as it has been demonstrated by measurements done in liquid nitrogen. The capacitance of a spare summing board has been measured before and after immersion into liquid nitrogen and found to decrease by 6.4% at cold. Similarly, the blocking capacitance of a piece of electrode has been found to be modified by -12%. This sensitivity will affect therefore at cold the blocking capacitance and the cross-talk fraction which traverses the material. Hence, the PRIAM simulation has been applied to the case of the gap filled with liquid argon having an electric permitivity of \(\epsilon_{r}\)=1.5. The corresponding capacitances parameters become:

\(C_{G}\)=4\(\times\)(14.721+12.63\(\times\)W) pF/m, capacitance to ground for a bi-gap for cold

C\({}_{X}\)=4\(\times\)16.3 pF/m, cross-talk capacitance to one neighbour for cold

The honey comb filling the 75% of the cell surface occupies actually a small volume keeping it free from liquid argon. That means that the corresponding capacitance will not change with respect to warm. Hence, the capacitance to ground becomes:

\(\mathrm{C}_{G}^{cold}\)=\(4\times\)(14.721+12.63W)(1-V\({}_{hc}\)+0.98\(\times\) V\({}_{hc}\)) region filled with LAr

\(+\)4\(\times\)1.02\(\times\)(9.814+8.421W)\(\times\)0.02\(\times\)V\({}_{hc}\) pF/m region free from LAr

In total we have therefore:

Figure 10: Left: expected constributions to cell capacitances as a function of \(\eta\). Right: Total expected capacitance as a function of \(\eta\) and comparison with measurements done on M13 module. The agreement is very fair.

\[\mathrm{C}^{cold}_{total}\mathrm{=}(\mathrm{C}^{cold}_{G}\mathrm{+}\mathrm{C}^{ old}_{X})\mathrm{\parallel}\mathrm{C}_{BC}\mathrm{+}\mathrm{C}^{cold}_{HV}\mathrm{+} \mathrm{C}^{cold}_{SB}\]

with:

\[\mathrm{C}^{cold}_{BG}\mathrm{=}\mathrm{C}^{warm}_{BG}\mathrm{\times}0.88\] \[\mathrm{C}^{cold}_{SB}\mathrm{=}\mathrm{C}^{warm}_{SB}\mathrm{ \times}0.936\] \[\mathrm{C}^{cold}_{HV}\mathrm{=}\mathrm{C}^{warm}_{HV}\mathrm{ \times}0.88\]

In figure 11 the expected total capacitance at cold is shown as a function of pseudorapidity \(\eta\). The ratio of capacitances at cold and warm conditions is also shown. The average expected value is 1.36.

### Inductance

Inductance is not sensitive to the dielectric permitivity, therefore it is not expected to change after the filling of the calorimeter with liquid argon. In the scheme where a cell is modelized as a transmission line, the inductance is dominated by the narrow lines bringing the signal to the back of the electrodes where the readout boards are plugged-in. It can therefore be computed from the dimensions of these lines and the propagation time.

\[\mathrm{Inductance}\mathrm{\ L}=\tau^{2}_{dift}\mathrm{/C}_{line}\mathrm{\ n }\mathrm{H}\mathrm{/}\mathrm{mm}\]

Here \(\mathrm{C}_{line}\) is the sum of line capacitance to ground (\(\mathrm{C}_{ground}\)) and to neighbour (\(\mathrm{C}_{X}\)). Additional inductance contributions may come from summing boards. Indeed previous measurements showed that the summing board inductance is varying with \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) because of the different lengths the signals are following going from the input to the output of the board. In figure 12 the total expected inductance is shown as a function of pseudorapidity for a given \(\phi\).

Figure 11: Expected total capacitance as a function of \(\eta\), at warm and cold. Figure on the right shows the expected capacitance ratio.

### LC extraction for middle cells

Simulation has shown that the resonance point depends only on the LC product and that it is independant from other parameters like cables length, termination, R\({}_{cal}\) etc. Moreover, its position is -in general- far from the wiggles that result from misadaptation. We fit therefore the signal closely around its minimum by a 3rd order polynomial function; fitting allows to extract the real minimum independently from eventual local fluctuations and the 3rd order is chosen to take into account the fact that the bottom of the resonance curve is in general left-right asymmetric. The method has been trained with simulated signals, showing that the so-fitted resonance is close to the true one within \(\pm\)0.3 %, what corresponds to one bin of the frequency measurement (\(\approx\)100KHz).In figure 13 a typical resonance curve is shown and the fitted region is zoomed.

Figure 12: Expected inductance (in nH) as a function of \(\eta\). The observed structures are due to the lines bringing the signal to the back of the electrodes.

Figure 13: Example of transfert function with a zoom around the resonance in the right plot.

For each cell (\(\eta\), \(\phi\)) we record three informations, the fitted resonance frequency \(\omega_{0}\), the height of the signal at resonance frequency V\({}_{out}\)(\(\omega_{0}\)) and the height of the signal at \(\approx\)0 frequency V\({}_{out}\)(0).

In figure 14 the resonance frequencies for the M and P wheels are shown as a function of pseudorapidity. Resonance happens at lower frequencies when \(\eta\) increases up to 1.2. Then, the limited depth of the calorimeter induces lower capacitance, thus higher frequencies. For each of the 56 \(\eta\) bins all 256 cells in \(\phi\) are plotted; for a given \(\eta\) two distinct populations are seen, differing in frequency by 2-3 MHz, corresponding to the inductance structure of the summing boards following \(\phi\).

The campaign of measurements at cold took place using another type of Network Analyzer from the same manufacture, because the usual one went in failure during the dedicated period. Relative calibrations showed good compatibility between the two apparatus.

#### 4.5.1 Warm over cold ratio

In fig 15 the ratio of frequencies at warm and cold is shown for both weeks. Two remarks can be drawn:

* Some structures are observed due to cells having a higher ratio for some particular \(\eta\) values. Investigations showed that at cold, the corresponding resonance curves are distorted close to their minimum, so that the obtained frequency is not the true one (see figure 15). Interestingly enough, this happens for almost all cells in \(\phi\) of the affected \(\eta\). These cells are mostly concentrated in the A electrode region (\(\eta\leq\)0.8). Apart of it, few other \(\eta\) values are also concerned. This behaviour is common to both wheels.

Figure 14: Resonance frequencies at warm for M and P wheels as a function of \(\eta\).

The distortion might come from wiggles existing already at warm but without affecting the resonance point which is at higher frequency in ambiant air. We applied a special fit method allowing to recover a "better" resonance frequency. The method has been trained by eye on "good" cells before being applied to the distorted ones.

The two droping edges around the minimum are separately fitted by polynomial functions of second order whose crossing point has been taken as the minimum of the resonance point, as shown in figure 16. The method showed no bias on good channels, when comparing with the true minimum, within an uncertainty of 100KHz (0.3-0.5%). For a given affected

\(\eta\), the same correction is applied for all \(\phi\)'s. The result gives a more uniform image of the warm/cold frequency ratio but, still not perfect (fig. 17).
* The average value of the warm over cold frequency ratio is of 1.17 with an RMS of 0.012. This value was deeply investigated as explained in chapter 4.3. In figure 18 the ratio dependance with \(\eta\) is shown and compared with the calculated one. The agreement is not perfect, the simulation giving still a higher ratio than the measurement and somehow different structures. We remind that for a change by \(\epsilon_{r}\)=1.5 this ratio would have been around 1.22 (=\(\sqrt{(}\)1.5)).

Figure 17: In left figures, warm over cold ratios are shown before and after corrections for M(up) and P(down) wheels. In right, the maps of this ratio are shown for M(up) and P(down) half-barrels.

A possible explanation for the remaining difference could be small, unidentified contributions of capacitances not changing at cold that might still exist. An extra 60pF could be enough to reproduce the data.

#### 4.5.2 Absolute frequencies

In this section, absolute frequencies for middle compartment cells, measured either in air or in liquid Argon, are compared with the calculations of L and C presented previously. This comparison allows one to identify possibly missing terms in the calculation and to check the correctness of the cell modelization. In figure 19 resonance frequencies at warm and expectations are shown as a function of pseudorapidity. Calculated values take into account all contributions detailed in 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4. The structures in \(\eta\) correspond to the different strip lengths bringing the cell signals to the back of the electrodes. The shape is well reproduced while the amplitude of the effect not completely. The measurement points correspond to the average value for all \(\phi\)'s for each \(\eta\).

This comparison exercise has been repeated for cold conditions, shown in figure 19. The quality of the agreement is similar as at warm.

### Gap survey

One can survey the stability of cell gaps by measuring the corresponding capacitances. Indeed, as the detector capacitance is mainly determined by the cell dimensions, it is particularly sensitive to the gap; hence, possible construction non-uniformities, deformation during barrel building, gravity saggitas etc, can be identified, if large enough, by looking at capacitances.

Figure 18: Warm over cold ratio as a function of \(\eta\) and comparison with expectation, for M(left) and P(right) wheels.

However, what is extracted from the measurement is the product LC. Detailed studies [9] of the signal shape have been performed, aiming to find out an absolute method to disentangle L, C and other electric parameters. It turns out that strong correlations between all variables determining resonance shape do not allow such a precise extraction. We concentrated therefore our efforts to completely exploit the LC information, in particular for the survey of gap stability.

As shown previously, for a given \(\eta\), the two distinct cell populations in frequency correspond to the variation of the summing board contribution to L which varies with \(\phi\). The shape of this variation, shown in figure 20, is quite uniform from one summing board to the other and can be corrected for. After this correction, remaining frequency dispersion per given \(\eta\) is well compatible with the 0.5-1.0% of gap uniformity as measured during construction of the modules.

For each \(\eta\), the average frequency is first computed, which is then subtracted from the frequency of each of 256 cells in \(\phi\). The result, shown, in figure 20 bottom, is the calorimeter map \(\eta\) versus \(\phi\) of deviations from the expected (i.e average) value. Reasons for such deviations are essentialy two-fold: a mis-measurement of the resonance curve for a given channel because of broken electrical connectivity etc. Or, a true capacitance or inductance variation with respect to the expected values. The latest case is the one that may be related to gap deformation.

To cross-check our method, we used the geometrical azimuthal position measurements performed after the assembling of the wheels [10]. They were obtained by comparing the real position in \(\phi\) of few reference cells located in 8 different modules every 45 degrees, with the ideal ones. The position of such a cell is sensitive to possible deformations and displacements of all neighbour upper and lower cells caused by sagging effects. The geometrical measurement was done at ambiant air, at the \(\eta\)=0 side of the wheels what corresponds to the maximum saggita radius. While such geometrical measurements see integrated displacements, electrical measurements can only access information of a single cell, through the resonance curve.

Figure 19: Absolute resonance frequencies at warm (left) and cold (right), for M wheel and comparison with expectations.

In the following, the results concerning cell gaps, as extracted from resonance and geometrical measurements, are compared. To do so, one concentrates on cells in low \(\eta\) region, to be closer to the conditions of the geometrical measurement done at z=0 (\(\eta\)=0). In figure 21 left the resonance frequency deviation from the average value as explained above is plotted, as a function of the \(\phi\) position for cells with \(\eta<\)10. No particular structure is seen because the correction for the summing board contribution has been already applied.

Figure 20: Figure top-left: resonance frequency as a function of \(\phi\) cell position for different \(\eta\). Figure top-right shows resonance frequencies at warm as a function of \(\eta\) before (in black) and after correction of the effect on \(\phi\) (in purple). The average resonance frequency is also plotted (in blue). Bottom figure shows the \(\eta-\phi\) map of the relative difference from the average frequency.

In figure 21 right, the accumulated distribution of frequency deviations starting from \(\phi\)=0 is shown, meaning that at each \(\phi\) we plot the sum over all the previous cells. This can be compared with the geometrical measurements which, at one point, take by definition into account eventual neighbour deformations as well. Frequency deviations are translated in centimetres assuming that the effect comes from capacitance distorsion because of gap variation:

\[\Delta(\text{cell})= 2\times 4\times\Delta(\text{frequency})/\text{frequency}\times L_{ cell}\]

where the factor 2 comes from the square-root in the relation between frequency and capacitance, the factor 4 because four gaps in \(\phi\) are ganged together to form a cell and \(L_{cell}\)=4.2 mm is the total cell gap width.

Depending on every how many modules the comparison is done, \(\Delta(\text{cell})\) has to be multiplied by 16\(\times N_{mod}\) (number of cells in \(\phi\) per module). In figure 22 left, the two measurements are compared at eight different points, located in modules positionned every 45\({}^{o}\), on the P wheel. The general tendancy is similar with the structures seen by resonance results. For the M wheel, the comparison is less satisfactory: the shape of integrated deformations behaves differently. The origin of this is located around cells at \(\phi\) 130 and 180, where a depletion is observed in the difference between measured and expected frequencies. This is shown in figure 23, where are ploted both the \(\eta\)-\(\phi\) map of the M wheel (up) and the accumulated deviation computed for \(\eta<\)16 (down). One can notice, that electrical measurements are also sensitive to readout boards contribution, while the geometrical survey is blind to such effects.

Globally, the size of cell displacements remains small: the \(\pm\)2 mm total excursion does correspond to less than 10\(\mu\)m of average deviation per individual cell.

Figure 21: The left figure shows the frequency deviation from the average in \(\phi\). In right, the accumulated distribution is shown as a function of \(\phi\).

## 5 Internal damping resistances

The internal damping resistance of each cell, Rcell, is needed to be known for the signal reconstruction, as explained in the introduction [2]. In practice, one can extract Rcell values from the amplitude of the signal at the resonance point which is directly proportional to Rcell, through \(\mathrm{V_{\mathit{out}}/V_{\mathit{in}}}\)=Rcell/R\({}_{\mathit{cal}}\).

### Expected values

The resistance of a cell is essentially due to its copper made surface and can be computed as follows:

\[\mathrm{Rcell}\mathrm{=}\rho(\mathrm{in}\ \Omega\times\mathrm{m})\times \mathrm{L}(\mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{m})/\mathrm{S}(\mathrm{in}\ \mathrm{m}^{2})\]

where \(\rho(\mathrm{Copper})\)=\(18\times 10^{-9}\ \Omega\times\mathrm{m}\) is the resistivity of the electrode copper material. L represents the length of the cell and of its consecutive readout strips and S the corresponding sections.

The copper thickness (\(35\mu\mathrm{m}\)) is in fact larger than its skin depth for all accessible resonance frequencies: the skin depth \(0.066\mathrm{cm}/\sqrt{(}\nu)\) remains smaller than \(25\mu\mathrm{m}\) for frequencies above \(20\mathrm{MHz}\) at both warm and cold temperature. In the formula giving the damping resistance, the skin depth instead of the copper thickness is therefore used.

In addition to the cell and to the connections, readout boards can contribute to the total resistance. The measured resistance values are \(77\) to \(132\mathrm{m}\Omega\) for a middle summing board, varying with \(\eta\) and \(\phi\), and of about \(40\mathrm{m}\Omega\) for a middle motherboard. Following \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) the variation comes from the strip length differences inside the board.

In figure 24 expected resistance values from cell dimensions and connections are shown as a function of pseudorapidity. Since Rcell is proportional to the longitudinal cell dimension, the corresponding contribution follows the behaviour of strip's length following \(\eta\).

In the same figure, the total expected resistance is indicated, when adding contributions from readout boards in a minimal and maximal scheme following \(\phi\). Consecutively, a middle calorimeter cell is expected to have an average resistance of \(280\mathrm{m}\Omega\).

Figure 24: Expected resistance computed from cell and readout stips dimensions

### Recall measurements

In figure 25 the signal amplitude at resonance is shown as a function of \(\eta\), in db, for measurements done in P wheel at warm conditions. The discontinuity between A and B electrodes, is due to the change of R\({}_{cal}\) value from 1K\(\Omega\) in the first region to 500\(\Omega\) in the second one. To transform signal's minimum S\({}_{min}\) to resistance values we compute

Rcell= 10\({}^{S_{min}/20}\times\)R\({}_{cal}\)

where the numerical factor depending on S\({}_{min}\) matters to transform from decibel to intensity ratio. The mean value of \(\approx\)300m\(\Omega\)s fits well the damping resistance found from calculation. However, the observed structures in \(\eta\) are not understood. For A electrodes, an anti-correlation with cell and strip length is seen instead of the expected correlation. For B electrodes, an aditionnal structure in \(\phi\), introduces a dispersion of resistance values in \(\eta\). Figure 26 up, shows the (\(\eta\),\(\phi\)) map of damping resistances. In figure 26 down, the resistance value at liquid argon temperature is plotted as a function of \(\eta\), for P Wheel. Going from air to liquid Argon temperature, damped resistances decrease by a factor of 1.65 in average, while a factor of two is expected from copper resistivity (\(\times\)0.25) and skin depth (\(\times\)2) variations. Moreover, the scale of structures following \(\eta\) is smaller at cold than at warm.

## 6 Survey of R\({}_{cal}\)

As seen in chapter 4.1, cell resonance curves allow the survey of the calibration resistances but with less accuracy than the direct measurements described in section 2. which are related to the signal amplitude at frequency\(\rightarrow\)0: Vout(0)/Vin=Rterm/R\({}_{cal}\) where Rterm is the 33 Ohms feedthrough termination. Assuming perfect uniformity of Rterm, one can therefore deduce R\({}_{cal}\) and vice-versa. In figure 27 the \(\eta-\phi\) maps of R\({}_{cal}\) is shown for M and P wheels at warm.

Figure 25: Left figure shows the minimum amplitude of the resonance signal as a function of \(\eta\). In right, the corresponding resistance value is plotted.

This can be compared to the calorimeter map of direct R\({}_{cal}\) measurements presented in section 3. Calibration resistances underwent stringent construction specifications to be uniform to 0.1%.

In practice, R\({}_{cal}\) survey through LC measurements isnot precise enough to detect eventual variations to that level. The network analyser is by construction very stable in frequency and less competitive for amplitude measurements. Consecutively, slow drifts are not excluded and might affect variables extracted from it. But the absolute value is generally correct. Using the true R\({}_{cal}\) values as input, one can extract from the resonance measurements the Rterm distribution quite precisely, to be 29.8\(\pm\)0.3 Ohms.

Figure 26: Map of resistances at warm for P wheel (up). In the down plot, the resistances at cold are shown as a function of \(\eta\).

### The Test Beam module case

R\({}_{cal}\) and LC measurements have been performed on the module which has been used in the combined test-beam period in summer 2004. Here we present few results concerning LC and Rcell values. These parameters have been measured in both warm and cold conditions, using the same AGILENT apparatus. In general, all observations done in the barrel described in previous chapters, are valid as well. In particular, the warm over cold ratio of resonance frequencies is approximatively 1.17.

LC values thus obtained, were available to be compared with LC values extracted from models based on the calibration signal corrected for the injection point ([2]). In figure 28 the resonance frequencies from the two methods are compared cell by cell. The compatibility is good within 1%. Similarly, extraction of Rcell has been done. In figure 29 the values are

Figure 27: Calibration resistances as deduced from resonance measurements, for M (Up) and P (down) wheels at warm. For color uniformity purposes, resistances values for \(\eta>31\) are ploted multiplied by a factor \(\approx\)2. Indeed, calibration resistances in A and B electrodes are differing by a factor of two.

shown for each feedthrough separately: because of different construction, the two feedthroughs of the test-beam modules behaved quite differently. However these results cannot be directly compared with the extracted from the calibration pulse Rcell values; indeed, the latest are not computed but tuned during a minimisation procedure. Thus, the obtained values might absorb other effects that would explain the difference (factor 4-5) we observe with Rcell results obtained from resonance measurements.

Figure 28: Resonance frequencies from hardware measurements (in green) compared to the computed ones using calibration signals (blue).In the left figure the difference channel by channel is plotted.

Figure 29: Total resistance for the cells of module used for the combined test beam in 2004. The two feedthroughs are plotted separately.

Conclusions

Data recorded in dedicated series of measurements, allowed the extraction of LC, Recall and R\({}_{cal}\) values for all barrel cells and test beam module.

Calibration resistances have been measured and their tolerance found within 0.1%. Few positions might need special care during the commissioning of the calorimeter.

LC values fairly agree with expectations computed taking into account of cell geometry and of readout components. The total capacitance variation from warm to cold remains still not completely understood. Further investigations would concern the use of hardware measurements in combination with the RTM signal prediction method [2] or as input in a first-principle method predicting both, calibration and physics signal [11]. For this purpose all electrical parameters would be stored in condition data to allow their use inside Athena.
