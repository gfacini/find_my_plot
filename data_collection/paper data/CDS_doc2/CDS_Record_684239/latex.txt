###### Abstract

We study the single production of excited electrons at the CERN LHC through contact interactions of fermions. Subsequent decays of excited electrons to ordinary electrons and electroweak gauge bosons via gauge interactions are examined. Excited single electrons could be accessible up to a mass range of 1.0-4.0 TeV at LHC

## 1 Introduction

A natural explanation for the existence of the fermionic generations or possibly of the new results on the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron[1] is the compositeness of the known leptons and quarks, sharing common constituents (preons). According to this approach, a quark or lepton might be a bound state of three fermions [2] or a fermion and a boson [3]. In many models along this line, quarks and leptons are composed of a scalar and a spin-1/2 preon. Composite models [4] predict a rich spectrum of excited states[4, 5] of known particles. Naturally, in these models spin-1/2 is assigned to the lowest lying radial and orbital excitations. Searching for the spin of the lowest lying fermionic excitations could thus give a rather direct clue to the underlying preon structure. Therefore, it is important to conduct experiments which will probe possible substructure of leptons and quarks and test the variety of preonic models.

Exchange of preons may lead to contact interactions between quarks and leptons. In this sense, it is conceivable that the standard model (SM) is just the low energy limit of a more fundamental theory which is characterised by a large mass scale \(\Lambda\). The existence of four-fermion contact interactions would be a signal of new physics beyond the SM. If the experimental energy scale is high enough, the nature of this new physics can be probed. It is expected that the next generation of hadron colliders like the LHC which will reach veryhigh center of mass energies will enable to extend the search for composite states. In particular, contact interactions may be an important source for excited lepton production at the CERN LHC. Updated lower limits on the scale of compositeness \(\Lambda\) are given by the ALEPH Collaboration, \(\Lambda>6.2\) TeV [6] and D0 Collaboration \(\Lambda>4.2\) TeV [7]. Lower mass limits for excited lepton mass are given by the ZEUS Collaboration, \(m_{\epsilon^{*}}>200\) GeV[8] and the OPAL Collaboration, \(m_{\epsilon^{*}}>306\) GeV[9].

In the present study, single production of excited electrons is simulated through contact interactions at LHC energies. This work is a continuation of previous work devoted to the study of the excited quark production with subsequent decay to a quark and photon [10], a quark and gluon[11] and a quark and \(W/Z\)[12].

## 2 Effective Lagrangian

In phenomenological models, it is assumed that any theory of compositeness at large mass scale must have a low energy limit that preserves the symmetries of the SM. If quarks and leptons are composite at the energy scale \(\Lambda\), the strong forces binding their constituents induce flavour-diagonal contact interactions, which have significant effects at subprocess energies well below \(\Lambda\)[5]. Contact interactions between quarks and leptons may appear as the low energy limit of the exchange of heavy particles. At sufficiently high energies excited fermions could be produced directly. They should form weak iso-doublets and carry electromagnetic charges similar to those of the ordinary fermions. We will assume that the excited leptons have spin and isospin 1/2 to limit the number of parameters.

### Production of excited leptons

Excited leptons may couple to ordinary quarks via contact interactions resulting from preon interactions. For energies below the compositeness scale \(\Lambda\), these interactions can be described by an effective four-fermion Lagrangian[5]

\[L_{C}=\frac{g_{*}^{2}}{2\Lambda^{2}}j^{\mu}j_{\mu} \tag{1}\]

with

\[j_{\mu}=\eta_{L}\overline{f}_{L}\gamma_{\mu}\,f_{L}+\eta_{L}^{\prime}\, \overline{f}_{L}^{*}\gamma_{\mu}\,f_{L}^{*}+\eta_{L}^{\prime\prime}\, \overline{f}_{L}^{*}\gamma_{\mu}\,f_{L}+(L\to R)+\textit{h.c.} \tag{2}\]

where the coupling \(g_{*}^{2}=4\pi\); \(\eta_{L}\) and \(\eta_{R}\) are coefficients for left-handed and right-handed currents, respectively. Here we assume \(\eta_{L}=1\) and \(\eta_{R}=0\), for simplicity.

At the CERN LHC pp collider, excited leptons can be produced either singly \(q\overline{q}\to l^{\overline{l}}\,,l^{*}l^{*}\overline{l}\) or in pairs \(q\overline{q}\to l^{*}\overline{l}^{*}\) through contact interactions as shown in Fig. 1.

Pair production searches are sensitive to excited leptons of mass up to values close to the kinematic limit, _i.e._ beam energy, while excited single lepton production searches extend the sensitivity to the mass range above the beam energy nearly up to the centre of mass energy.

The partonic cross sections for excited lepton production through contact interactions are given by [5]\[\widehat{\sigma}(q\overline{q}\to l^{\overline{l}^{*}},l^{*}\overline{l})=\frac{ \pi}{6\widehat{s}}\left(\frac{\widehat{s}}{\Lambda^{2}}\right)^{2}\left(1+\frac {v}{3}\right)\,\left(1-\frac{m^{*\,2}}{\widehat{s}}\right)^{2}\left(1+\frac{m^{ *\,2}}{\widehat{s}}\right) \tag{3}\]

\[\widehat{\sigma}(q\overline{q}\to l^{*\overline{l}^{*}})=\frac{\pi\widehat{v} }{12\widehat{s}}\left(\frac{\widehat{s}}{\Lambda^{2}}\right)^{2}\left(1+\frac {\widetilde{v}^{2}}{3}\right) \tag{4}\]

where

\[v=\frac{\widehat{s}-m^{*\,2}}{\widehat{s}+m^{*\,2}}\,\quad\widehat{v}=\left(1-4 \,\frac{m^{*\,2}}{\widehat{s}}\right)^{1/2} \tag{5}\]

Cross sections for single and pair production of excited leptons through contact interactions are shown in Fig. 2. Since \(l^{*}\overline{l^{*}}\) pair production requires larger center of mass energy than single \(l\overline{l^{*}}\) production, it is less favoured.

Cross section values were calculated using Gl\(\ddot{w}\)ck, Reya and Vogt parton distribution function (PDF), set 94 L0[13]. Other PDF's were tried: CTEQ3L and CTEQ5L differ in their cross-section prediction by about 20% and 30%, respectively. New PDF's extend slightly the mass reach for excited electrons at the LHC.

### Decays of excited leptons

The Lagrangian describing the transition between excited fermions and ordinary fermions should respect chiral symmetry in order to prevent the light leptons from acquiring a large anomalous magnetic moment[3]. We will assume that this means that only the right-handed part of excited fermion currents takes part in the magnetic de-excitation.

Excited leptons will decay into a lepton and a gauge boson via vector-like couplings given by \(SU(2)\times U(1)\) invariant effective Lagrangian of magnetic moment type [5]

\[L_{G}\,=\,\frac{1}{2\Lambda}\overline{f}_{R}^{*}\sigma^{\mu\nu}\left(gf\frac{ \tau}{2}\cdot{\bf W}_{\mu\,\nu}+g^{\prime}f^{\prime}\frac{Y}{2}B_{\mu\,\nu} \right)\,f_{L}+H.c. \tag{6}\]

where W and B are the field strength tensors of the SU(2) and U(1) gauge fields with the gauge structure constants \(\tau\) and Y, respectively; \(g\) and \(g^{\prime}\) are

Figure 1: Contact interactions of excited leptons (\(l^{*}\)) with quark (\(q\)) and leptons (\(l\))

the corresponding gauge coupling constants. Finally, \(f\) and \(f^{\prime}\) are parameters determined by compositeness dynamics.

The produced excited leptons will decay either radiatively or weakly according to gauge interactions governed by the Lagrangian(3). We assume \(m^{*}>m_{W,Z}\) and neglect the ordinary fermion masses to obtain the partial decay widths:

\[\Gamma(l^{*}\to l\,V)=\frac{1}{4}\alpha_{\,V}f_{V}^{2}\frac{m^{*3}}{\Lambda^{2} }(1-\frac{m_{V}^{2}}{m^{*2}})^{2}(1+\frac{m_{V}^{2}}{2m^{*2}}) \tag{7}\]

with

\[f_{\gamma}\,=\,fT_{3}\,+\,f^{\prime}\frac{Y}{2},\quad f_{Z}=fT_{3}\mbox{cos}^{ 2}\theta-f^{\prime}\frac{Y}{2}\mbox{sin}^{2}\theta,\mbox{ and }f_{W}=\frac{f}{\sqrt{2}}\]

\(T_{3}\) and Y denotes the third component of the weak isospin and hypercharge of \(l^{*}\), respectively; \(\alpha_{\,V}=\frac{g_{V}^{2}}{4\pi}\), \(g_{W}\) and \(g_{Z}\) are the W and Z coupling constants, respectively. The decay widths of excited leptons into ordinary leptons and gauge bosons are rather small. For example, taking \(m^{*}=\Lambda=1\) TeV we obtain the total decay width \(\Gamma=7.0\) GeV ( see Table 1 ).

Decays of excited leptons via gauge interactions (Fig. 3) lead to a lepton and a gauge boson while decay mediated by contact interactions (Fig. 1) give \(l\,jj\) or \(3l\) final states.

\[l^{*}\to l\,\gamma \tag{8}\]

\[l^{*}\to l\,Z\to l+2j\,\,\mbox{or}\,\,3l \tag{9}\]

\[l^{\star}\to\nu W\to 2j+E_{T}^{miss}\ \text{or}\ l+E_{T}^{miss} \tag{10}\]

For the purpose of this study, we do not consider decays mediated by contact interactions, and the intrinsic width and branching ratios of the resonance may differ somewhat from the assumed values.

Associated production of ordinary and excited leptons yields final states consisting of two leptons plus a gauge boson on its mass shell, the latter decaying to a jet pair or two other leptons.

Pair production of excited leptons gives final states with up to six leptons. Background reactions to these channels are very rare in the standard model, and purely leptonic decays would provide very clear signatures for experimental identification of excited leptons.

QCD jets provide background which could be relevant. However, assuming good \(\gamma\)- or electron-jet separation, this type of background could be kept at low level.

## 3 Simulations

In this work, the production of excited single electrons are simulated through the process \(u\overline{u}\to e^{\ast}\overline{e}\) and \(d\overline{d}\to e^{\ast}\overline{e}\). Excited electron decay to an ordinary electron and a photon has been studied in this work. The simulations of excited lepton signal and relevant backgrounds were performed with PYTHIA[14] and ATLFAST[15] to take into account the experimental conditions prevailing at LHC for the ATLAS detector. The detector concept and its physics potential have been presented in the Technical Proposal[16] and the Technical De

sign Report[17]. The ATLFAST program for fast detector simulations accounts for the most detector aspects: jet reconstruction in the calorimeters, momentum/energy smearing for leptons and photons, magnetic field effects and missing transverse energy. It provides a list of reconstructed jets, isolated leptons and photons. In most cases, the detector dependent parameters were tuned to values expected for the performance of the ATLAS detector from full simulation.

The electromagnetic calorimeters were used to reconstruct the energy of leptons in cells of dimensions \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.025\) within the pseudorapidity range \(-2.5<\eta<2.5\); \(\phi\) is the azimuthal angle. The electromagnetic energy resolution is given by \(0.1/\sqrt{E}(GeV)\bigoplus 0.0005\) over this pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) region. The electromagnetic showers are identified as leptons when they lie within a cone of radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\eta)^{2}\times(\Delta\phi)^{2}}=0.2\) and possesses a transverse energy \(E_{T}>5\) GeV. Lepton isolation criteria were applied, requiring a distance \(\Delta R>0.4\) from other clusters and maximum transverse energy deposition, \(E_{T}<10\) GeV, in cells in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the direction of electron emission.

The production cross sections for the excited leptons and backgrounds are given in Table 2 and Table 3, respectively.

In order to enrich the event statistics in the region of high invariant masses, simulated background events were generated separately in different regions of the reaction transverse momentum, \(\hat{p}_{T}\).

Several types of backgrounds were selected for comparison with the signal events.

The dominant background for the signal process studied is the process \(q\overline{q}\ \to Z+\gamma\), where \(Z\) decays to 2 leptons (electron - positron pair) yielding 2 leptons and a photon in the final state.

Another type of background process is a \(WZ\), where \(Z\) again decays to an electron and a positron, and \(W\) decays to an electron and a neutrino. To suppress this type of background, an \(E_{T}^{miss}\) cut could be effective.

A third potential background is the single production of \(Z\) plus jet, where \(Z\) decays to lepton pair and the additional jet in the event could be misidentified with a photon. However, the photon/jet separation studies[18] done in ATLAS give a jet rejection of around 110 ( only based on calorimeter information ) for jet \(E_{T}\) of 20 GeV at high luminosity ( \(10^{34}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\) ). It is expected that the rejection factor will be at least as high at higher energies.

Decays of excited leptons produce characteristic event topologies and signatures which allow one to distinguish them from their backgrounds. Due to their large mass, excited leptons would produce events with large transverse energy. We study the event topology of excited leptons in the decay channel \(e^{*}\to e\gamma\) and apply the selection criteria for both signal and background events.

The following cuts were used to separate the signal from the background:

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \(\hat{p}_{T}\) & \(Z+jet\) & \(\gamma+Z\) & \(W+Z\) \\ \hline \(0.1<\hat{p}_{T}<0.3\) & \(27.71\) & \(5.2\times 10^{-2}\) & \(1.1\times 10^{-2}\) \\ \(0.3<\hat{p}_{T}<0.6\) & \(5.1\times 10^{-1}\) & \(1.3\times 10^{-3}\) & \(2.8\times 10^{-4}\) \\ \(0.6<\hat{p}_{T}<1.0\) & \(2.0\times 10^{-2}\) & \(7.4\times 10^{-5}\) & \(1.4\times 10^{-5}\) \\ \(1.0<\hat{p}_{T}<1.6\) & \(6.3\times 10^{-3}\) & \(5.3\times 10^{-6}\) & \(9.9\times 10^{-7}\) \\ \(\hat{p}_{T}>1.6\) & \(4.4\times 10^{-5}\) & \(2.2\times 10^{-7}\) & \(4.0\times 10^{-8}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 4: The transverse momentum (a) and pseudorapidity (b) distributions for electrons from events with the excited lepton production, \(m^{\star}=1\) TeV* The transverse momentum of leptons was required to be at least 300  GeV ( for \(m^{\star}\) = 1000  GeV ) and higher for higher \(m^{\star}\). Minimum transverse momentum cuts were chosen to be around \(m^{\star}/2-\delta p_{T}\), where \(\delta p_{T}\) was 200, 400, 600, 1100  GeV for \(m^{\star}\) = 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000  GeV, respectively.
* The acceptance of ATLAS for leptons is restricted to pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\). For \(m^{\star}>3000\)  GeV and beyond, a cut of \(|\eta|<2.0\) is applied because the events are more centrally distributed.

In Fig. 4a the transverse momentum of electrons in the signal event at \(m^{\star}\) = \(\Lambda\) = 1 TeV is presented. One can see that the transverse momentum of the electron originating from the decay of the excited lepton is smaller than the other electron in the event. On the other hand, the pseudorapidity distributions for both of these electrons, shown in Fig. 4b, are similar.

Since the transverse momentum of the electron originating from the excited electron decay is smaller, in general, than the transverse momentum of the other electron, the invariant mass calculated was of the photon and the electron having the lower \(p_{T}\). The resulting invariant mass distributions of photon - electron pairs are presented in Fig. 5 for different \(m^{\star}\) = \(\Lambda\) masses of the excited lepton. The distributions were normalised to an integrated luminosity of \(L\) = 3 \(\times\) 10\({}^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

The signal significances are defined at each mass point as \(S/\sqrt{B}\) where \(S\) and \(B\) are the number of accepted signal and background events in the selected mass bin, respectively. Achievable mass limits for the excited single electron production are established by requiring that at least 5 events survive the cuts and \(S/\sqrt{B}>5\), which corresponds to a 99% C.L.

Figure 5: Invariant mass distributions of \(e\gamma\) for various excited lepton masses, 1 TeV and 3 TeV for an integrated luminosity of 300\(fb^{-1}\). Upper part for signal events, bottom one for background distributions.

As can be seen from Table 4 and Fig. 6, the masses achieved for excited single lepton in the photon and electron decay modes are \(\sim 4.0\) TeV for \(m^{*}=\Lambda\), the couplings \(f=f^{\prime}=1\) and for an integrated luminosity \(L=3\times 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) at CERN LHC. In Fig. 6 we show the signal significance up to the mass of 4 TeV due to the low number of signal events beyond this mass value.

## 4 Conclusions

In a composite model of quarks and leptons, where they share common constituents, excited leptons could be produced copiously at CERN LHC. The first indication for such excited leptons could be the production of ordinary leptons at rates much larger than expected in the framework of the SM. Large lepton yields are expected if quarks and leptons share common sub-constituents. Clean

signatures are predicted by the large fraction of decays with leptons in the final state, that are a consequence of the uniform coupling among quarks and leptons through contact interactions. We have presented the results of excited single electron production with its subsequent decay to photon and electron final state. Singly produced excited electrons could be accessible up to a mass of 4.0 TeV at LHC if \(\Lambda=m^{\star}\). We also plan to study excited muon production as well as decays to fermions via contact interactions.
