**ABSTRACT**

A Monte Carlo study of the autocalibration for the ATLAS muon drift tube arrays is performed. Effectiveness of the calibration procedure for determining the \(r-t\) correlation curves in drift tubes by using the tracks created in the hadronic interactions is studied for different drift tube arrangements. Events generated by ISAJET are used in our study. Hits in the drift tubes of the entire ATLAS barrel muon detector are generated by propagating the charged tracks through the ATLAS detector using a GEANT based simulation package.

## 1 Introduction

The electric field inside a simple drift tube is inversely proportional to the distance from the anode wire. For a 3 cm diameter drift tube with 50 \(\mu\)m anode wire at +5 kV (for 5 atmosphere pressure operation), the electric field distribution is shown in **Fig. 1**. The drift velocity of the proposed gas mixture \((Ar-CO_{2}-C_{2}H_{6}-N_{2}\), 86:4:5:5) is very non-linear within this electric field range as shown in **Fig. 2**. As a result, the \(r-t\) correlation is also non-linear as shown in **Fig. 3**. Because of the fact that the gas drift velocity is not saturated, the drift velocity changes when the gas pressure, temperature and gas composition change. A mean of determining the \(r-t\) correlation in real time by using the muon track recorded in the experiment will be crucial for achieving good spacial resolution for the MDT system.

A procedure called 'autocalibration' is described in Ref. [1]. Good results are obtained in a cosmic ray test by using an array of honeycomb strip chamber. Results of Monte Carlo studies are presented by G. Viehhauser of NIKHEF during a ATLAS meeting. Monte Carlo studies done previously on this issue have been carried out under simple conditions: straight through single muon tracks, no magnetic field and for small number of tubes [2]. Some potential problems are identified and more studies are suggested by these studies[3].

Our simulation is intended to demonstrate the feasibility of autocalibration under real experiment conditions. We also want to investigate effects of different tube arrangements to the autocalibration.

## 2 Detector Simulation

In our study, the interaction region size is assumed to be \(\sigma_{z}=5\) cm. The solenoidal field of the central tracker is ignored. The ATLAS calorimeter is simplified as a solid piece of material with appropriate composition and density. Inside the calorimeter, the default cuts in GEANT are used except those for electrons and photons, which we use 100 MeV in order to save CPU time. Particles are propagated by GEANT, while the hadronic interactions in calorimeter are simulated by using a parameterized method, called ALGORIX [4]. All particles which are mainly prompt muons and decay muons in the muon spectrometer are propagated by GEANT. The drift tubes have an outer diameter 30 mm and the wall thickness is 0.25 mm. Other materials, such as supporting structure and the magnet, etc. are neglected in our current study. The efficiency of the muon drift tubes is assumed to be 98%. Photon, neutron and other background are not included. We only consider the first arrival signal in a drift tube.

Only the drift tubes in the barrel region are included in our current study. The locations of the muon stations are chosen according to the Progress Report on ATLAS Milestones [5]. The drift tube lengths, space between two multilayers in each muon station for small and large stations are taken from Joerg Viehhauser's e-mail [6]. The \(x-y\) and \(z-r\) views of the module arrangement is shown in **Fig. 4**.

The magnetic field map for the barrel and end cap toroids is used in the study. The muon tracks are bent by the toroidal magnetic field. The bending power of the magnetic field depends on \(\theta\). In our study, the tube arrays are divided into 5\({}^{\circ}\) regions. The \(r-t\) correlation within each region is considered the same. The intension of such kind of division is to study \(\theta\)-dependence of the autocalibration procedures. These angular regions are equivalent to \(\Delta z\) of 40 - 125 cm, 60 - 165 cm and 85 - 236 cm for inner, middle and outer muon stations respectively. In our study, the \(r-t\) correlation is assumed to be the same along the anode wire. We do not divide the autocalibration region in the \(\phi\) view (along the tube length) in order to have better statistics. We assume that in a real experiment the MDT arrays will be divided into small regions to eliminate the effect of lorentz angle to the autocalibration. Further studies are needed in order to optimize the tube placement and determine the best way of dividing the modules for the autocalibration.

## 3 Procedure of the Simulation

### Event generation

Hadronic interactions from proton-proton collision at 7 GeV/c + 7 GeV/c are generated by using ISAJET. Total five millions hadronic interactions in four jet \(P_{t}\) regions (\(4-10,10-20,20-30,30-1000GeV/c\)) are generated in this study. Appropriate weighting factors are given to events in different \(P_{t}\) range according to the jet cross-sections. The generated particles in the barrel region are recorded. These particles are propagated through the ATLAS detector by GEANT. Particles which reach the muon spectrometer are mostly prompt muons and decay muons.

Hits in the muon drift tubes are recorded as the distances from the anode wires. They are noted as \(r_{true}\)'s. These \(r_{true}\)'s are unknown in a real experiment. The experimentally measured quantity is the drift time. In our simulation, we convert the \(r_{true}\)'s into drift times according to a \(r-t\) correlation

\[t=\sigma_{true}^{2},\]

where c is a constant determined by the maximum drift time which is assumed to be 500 ns. This \(r-t\) correlation is arbitrarily assumed. It corresponds to the true \(r-t\) correlation in a real experiment. We call it the 'true' \(r-t\) correlation. In a real experiment, the 'true' \(r-t\) correlation curve is unknown. In simulation, the (t's) obtained this way are equivalent to the experimentally measured drift time and can be considered as known quantities throughout the autocalibration process. The purpose of the autocalibration is to find the 'true' \(r-t\) correlation by using the experimental data and, therefore, determine the true hit coordinates.

We can now start the autocalibration process from the known drift times. Just as in the real experimental data analysis, we convert the drift time (t's) into space coordinates according to an assumed \(r-t\) correlation. In a real experiment, we should have known this \(r-t\) correlation pretty well by other independent method before the autocalibration begins. Here, however, we intentionally assume that the beginning \(r-t\) correlation is quite different from the true \(r-t\) correlation. In fact, we can assume any kind of functions. But for the purpose of simplicity, we simply assume a linear function

\[r_{o}=c^{\prime}t.\]

We can then obtain a set of hits (\(r_{o}\)'s) in the drift tubes which are different from the hits originally generated. We start the fitting process from these hits.

### Track fitting

The cut off momentum for muons is approximately 2 GeV/c in the calorimeter. Most of the tracks are rather low energy ones which are bent a lot by the strong magnetic field of the muon toroid. Because of the large magnetic bend, the straight line fit is no longer valid for a muon station with two multilayers which are separated by 12.5 - 37.5 cm [6]. The saggia of such tracks within a multilayer, however, is very small. We, therefore, fit straight lines to the hits in a multilayer which has 3 or 4 tube layers.

**Fig. 5 (a)** shows the \(r-z\) view of a typical muon track in a section of the MDT stations. The track passes all the three stations. In **Fig. 5 (b)**, there are many track segments in muon stations. They are from low \(P_{t}\) muons which are trapped inside the air core toroid. Track segments in the three large muon stations and in the small inner muon station are shown in this figures.

**Fig. 6(a)** shows a track passing a MDT station at \(\theta=90^{\circ}\). The thick circles are \(r_{true}\)'s and the light circles are \(r_{o}\)'s. A straight line is fitted to the \(r_{o}\)'s. In most of the cases, hits from a track lie on both sides of the anode wires. Although the input to the fitting procedure is \(r_{o}\)'s which are generated according to an incorrect \(r-t\) correlation, the fitted values, however, are very close to the 'true' hits (\(r_{true}\)'s). This tells us that the autocalibration will converge quickly.

A section of a MDT station at \(30^{\circ}\) is shown in **Fig. 6(b)**. For the close packed tube arrangement, the 3 or 4 anode wires in a multilayer form a straight line at \(30^{\circ}\) angle. For most high momentum muon tracks originated in the interaction region, hits in drift tubes lie on one side of the wires. It has been found that the autocalibration does not work well in this region [3]. **Fig. 6(b)** shows a typical track at \(30^{\circ}\) angle. Indeed, the straight line fit cannot find the 'true' hits indicating the autocalibration will not converge.

### Finding the true \(r-t\) correlation

As described in the previous section, hits (\(r_{\circ}\)'s) in a multilayer (3 or 4 planes of tubes) are fitted to straight lines. The fitted hit coordinates (\(r_{1}\)'s) are plotted against the drift time \(t\) in **Fig. 7**. We calculate the average \(<r_{1}>\)'s in each small time interval and obtain a new \(r-t\) correlation. If the autocalibration converges, this new \(r-t\) correlation will be different from the previously assumed \(r-t\) correlation and will be closer to the 'true' \(r-t\) correlation. This new \(r-t\) correlation will be used to calculate (\(r_{2}\)'s) from the drift time (\(t\)'s). The (\(r_{2}\)'s) are then used as inputs for the next round of fitting. We repeat the above process until a final set of hit coordinates (\(r_{final}\)) is reached. At this point, the \(r-t\) correlation does not change any more.

## 4 Discussion

Usually, the converging process is rather fast. Only several iterations are necessary. We can evaluate the effectiveness of the autocalibration procedure by comparing the \(r_{final}\) and the \(r_{true}\) to see how close they are. The fact that these two sets of coordinates converge proves that we can achieve the goals of the autocalibration. The number of iterations it takes to reach the \(r_{final}\) is also an indicator for the effectiveness of the autocalibration procedure.

One of the question needs to be answered is that if different tube staggering arrangement makes any difference to the autocalibration. Another question is that if the convergence of the autocalibration depends on \(\theta\). For example, in the densest packed tube arrangement at \(\theta=30^{\circ}\), all anode wires along a muon track in a multilayer lie on a straight line which points to the interaction point. As a result, hits from a track originated from the interaction region will mostly appear on the same side of the wires. For a conventional autocalibration procedure, it is necessary to have hits distributed on both sides of the wires. Otherwise, the correct \(r-t\) correlation will be difficult to obtain. By alternating the tube arrangement in a multilayer, one may expect to reduce the severity of this problem. An alternative tube arrangement has been proposed by the Seattle group. This arrangement in principle should not have this so called 30\({}^{\circ}\) problem.

Most of the autocalibration studies done so far are using four or more tube layers. Questions also have been raised about the effectiveness of autocalibration if there are only three layers of tubes in a multilayer. We have studied both problems by using the simulation method described above.

## 5 Conclusions

1. Effects on autocalibration due to magnetic bend. By turning off the toroidal magnetic field, autocalibration converges everywhere for Seattle layout, but does not converge for the densest layout at 30\({}^{\circ}\). Curves in **Fig. 8** show the \(r-t\) correlations of all iterations for the densest layout at 30\({}^{\circ}\) angle. Curves in **Fig. 9** show the \(r-t\) correlations of all iterations for the Seattle layout at 20\({}^{\circ}\) angle which is the worst region regarding autocalibration. The curves in these two plots show the converging processes. As mentioned above in our autocalibration study, we use all muons tracks created in the real hadronic interactions. No any cuts are applied. Most of these muon tracks have very low momenta and are bent a lot by the strong magnetic field. Even for the inner MTD station, the bending is significant for the low momentum tracks. This magnetic bending greatly helps to solve the 30\({}^{\circ}\) problem.
2. Multilayer with four tube layers. With magnetic field, the autocalibration converges at all \(\theta\) angles for the two tube arrangements. Only a few iterations are required before reaching the final convergence. Curves in **Fig. 10(a)** and **(b)** show the \(r-t\) correlations obtained from each iteration for the densest layout at some \(\theta\)-angles for the small and large muon stations. It is clear that after only 4 to 5 iterations, the 'true' \(r-t\) correlation curve is reached.

Curves in **Fig. 11(a)** and **(b)** show the \(r-t\) correlations obtained from each iteration for the Seattle layout at some \(\theta\)-angles for the small and large muon stations. After 3 to 5 iterations, the 'true' \(r-t\) correlation curve is reached. The Seattle arrangement has a slight advantage over the densely packed arrangement. The converging speed is faster for the Seattle tube arrangement. The reason of this difference is that the most 30\({}^{\circ}\theta\) tracks do not help autocalibration to converge initially for the densest layout.
3. Multilayer with three tube layers. The autocalibration converges nicely for the densely packed tube arrangement. The convergence speed is still very fast. Curves in **Fig. 12(a)** and **(b)** show the \(r-t\) correlations obtained from each iteration for the densest layout at some \(\theta\)-angles for the small and large muon stations. It is clear that after 4-6 iterations, the 'true' \(r-t\) correlation curve is reached. The convergence of the autocalibration is much slower at most \(\theta\) angles for the Seattle tube layout. It, however, eventually converges after 15 iterations. Curves in **Fig. 13(a)** and **(b)** show the \(r-t\) correlations obtained from each iteration for the densest layout at some \(\theta\)-angles for the small and large muon stations. After 15 iterations, the 'true' \(r-t\) correlation curve is reached. Because there are only three hits on a track and because the special way of staggering the tube layers, in certain cases the fitted tracks always find the \((r^{\prime}_{\circ}s)\). These tracks, in fact prevent the \(r-t\) correlation from converging and, therefore, have negative effect on autocalibration converging process. This is clearly shown in **Fig. 14**. The fitted track tends to stay with the \((r^{\prime}_{\circ}s)\) and does not converge to \((r^{\prime}_{true}s)\). This problem is similar to the so called 30\({}^{\circ}\) problem for the densest layout. This situation is more serious for a set of tracks which have \(r_{true}\)'s at about half tube radius. We call the half tube radius as a Blind Point of autocalibration for the Seattle tube layout.
4. Required statistics. As can be seen in the plots, although 5.1 million ISAJET events are used in this study and no any cuts on the track \(P_{t}\) are used, the total number of tracks in the MDT stations is only approximately 41,000 distributed in 2 x 11 \(\theta\) regions. As a result, the statistics of this study is rather poor. Nonetheless, the autocalibration converges very nicely. This proves that for autocalibration convergence, the required number of tracks is not very large.

The poor statistics are limited by the capacity of available computing power. In real experiment, we do not expect this will be a problem. Because the fact that very low momentum tracks can be used in the autocalibration, it will be very easy to accumulate enough tracks for autocalibration even we divide the detector into small regions.
