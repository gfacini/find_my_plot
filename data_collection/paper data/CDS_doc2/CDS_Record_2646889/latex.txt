Search prospects for resonant Higgs boson pair production in the \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) final state with large-radius jets from \(pp\) collisions at the HL-LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

This note presents a study of resonant Higgs boson pair production in the \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) final state with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV \(pp\) collisions at the HL-LHC. Results are based on a combination of extrapolation from a search carried out with \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV data and smearing of particle-truth level Monte Carlo simulation for the Kaluza-Klein graviton signal and the dominant multijet background. The truth-based analysis emulates the "boosted" analysis in which each of the Higgs bosons decaying into a \(b\bar{b}\) system is reconstructed as a large-radius jet. Upper limits on the cross section for \(pp\to G_{\rm KK}\to HH\to b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) are estimated to be in the range between 1.44 fb at a resonance mass of 1.0 TeV and 0.025 fb at 3.0 TeV, at the 95% confidence level.

## 1 Introduction

The discovery of the Higgs boson (\(H\)) with a relatively low mass of 125 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) is reaffirming the need to search for natural solutions to the hierarchy problem. Many new physics models predict rates of Higgs boson pair production significantly higher than the Standard Model (SM) rate [1; 2; 3]. For example, TeV-scale resonances such as the first Kaluza-Klein (KK) excitation of the graviton, \(G_{\mathrm{KK}}\), predicted in the bulk Randall-Sundrum (RS) model [4; 5] or the heavy neutral scalar of two-Higgs-doublet models (2HDM) [6] can decay into pairs of Higgs bosons, \(HH\).

The projection study presented here assumes an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) collected with proton-proton collisions at the High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) [7] operating at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) and with a mean number of \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing \(\mu=200\). The projection uses the search for high-mass spin-2 KK gravitons decaying into \(HH\) as a benchmark, with each of the Higgs bosons decaying to \(b\overline{b}\), thereby yielding a final state with two highly boosted \(b\overline{b}\) systems, which are reconstructed as two large-radius jets. The most recent results of searches for \(HH\) resonances in the \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\) final state have been released by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [8; 9] and correspond to the analysis of about 36 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=13\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\). Based on these results, a lower mass limit of 1.36\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) is set at the 95% confidence level (CL) for coupling parameter \(k/\overline{M}_{\mathrm{Pl}}=1.0\)[8].

An upgraded ATLAS detector [10] will operate at the HL-LHC. The upgraded detector includes a new all-silicon inner tracking detector [11] consisting of five layers of pixel detectors and four layers of double-sided silicon strip detectors to reconstruct the trajectory of charged particles within the pseudorapidity range \(|\eta|<4.0\). A superconducting solenoid with a 2 T axial magnetic field surrounds the inner tracker to enable the momentum of charged particles to be measured. Electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters [12; 13] located outside of the solenoid provide energy measurements with high granularity within \(|\eta|<4.9\). The outer most muon spectrometer [14] consists of a set of superconducting toroidal magnets and three layers of gas chambers to measure the trajectories of muons up to \(|\eta|=2.7\). It also incorporates fast detectors for triggering purposes up to \(|\eta|=2.4\). In addition to upgrades to the detector, the on-line trigger system will be replaced by a new system [15] capable of processing the ten-fold rate increase anticipated at the HL-LHC.

The following strategy is followed to obtain sensitivity estimates at the HL-LHC: (i) signal and background mass distributions for the pair of candidate Higgs bosons in the event are taken from the most recent ATLAS data analysis at \(\sqrt{s}=13\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\)[8] and scaled to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\); (ii) simulated signal and background mass distributions are used to derive mass-dependent scaling functions to extrapolate the distributions from \(\sqrt{s}=13\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) to 14\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\); (iii) simulated signal and background mass distributions are used for further scaling of the distributions to reproduce the impact of additional selection criteria not included in Ref. [8]. Systematic uncertainties are scaled down by factors of two or more (where applicable) relative to the values from the 13\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) data analysis to account for the increased precision available with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at the HL-LHC.

## 2 Signal model

The projection is based on an interpretation in terms of \(G_{\mathrm{KK}}\) production in the bulk RS model. This model is used as a benchmark against which the improvement in sensitivity at the HL-LHC can be assessed. The RS model postulates the existence of a warped extra dimension in which only gravity propagates as in theoriginal "RS1" scenario [16] or in which both gravity and all SM fields propagate as in the "bulk RS" scenario [17]. Propagation in the extra dimension leads to a tower of Kaluza-Klein excitations of gravitons (denoted \(G_{\text{KK}}\)) and SM fields. In the bulk RS model considered here, KK gravitons are produced via both quark-antiquark annihilation and gluon-gluon fusion, with the latter dominating due to suppressed couplings to light fermions. The strength of the coupling depends on \(k/\overline{M}_{\text{Pl}}\), where \(k\) corresponds to the curvature of the warped extra dimension and \(\overline{M}_{\text{Pl}}=2.4\times 10^{18}\) GeV is the effective four-dimensional Planck scale. Both the production cross section and decay width of the KK graviton scale as the square of \(k/\overline{M}_{\text{Pl}}\). For the values \(k/\overline{M}_{\text{Pl}}=0.5\) and \(1.0\) used in the interpretation, the relative \(G_{\text{KK}}\) resonance widths (\(\Gamma/m\)) are approximately \(1.5\%\) and \(6\%\), respectively. In both cases, the width of the reconstructed signal mass peaks is dominated by the experimental resolution. The \(G_{\text{KK}}\) branching fraction to \(HH\) is approximately \(10\%\); other final states are \(t\bar{t}\) (\(60\%\)), \(WW\) (\(20\%\)), and \(ZZ\) (\(10\%\)).

## 3 Monte Carlo simulation

### Signal samples

Samples for the signal process are generated for \(\sqrt{s}=13\) and \(14\) TeV with the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO Monte Carlo (MC) event generator [18] using the implementation of the RS bulk model from Ref. [19] and cross sections computed at higher order from Ref. [20]. The coupling parameter for the warped extra dimension is set to \(k/\overline{M}_{\text{Pl}}=1.0\). Predictions for \(k/\overline{M}_{\text{Pl}}=0.5\) use the \(k/\overline{M}_{\text{Pl}}=1.0\) samples scaled down by a factor of four to account for the decrease in cross section. The output of the event generation is interfaced to Pythia8[21] for the decay of Higgs bosons to \(b\overline{b}\) pairs, as well as for parton showering, hadronization, and underlying-event simulation. The Higgs boson mass is set to \(125\) GeV. The NNPDF2.3[22] leading-order (LO) parton distribution functions (PDFs) are used throughout for signal production.

### Background samples

The dominant background for the \(13\) TeV data analysis stems from multijet production. This background source is estimated directly from data in that analysis and represents about \(80\%\), \(90\%\), and \(95\%\) of the total background in the signal region for events with 2, 3, and 4 \(b\)-tags (the classification of events based on the number of \(b\)-tags is described below). The remaining source of background originates almost completely from \(t\bar{t}\) production. The shape of the dijet mass distribution for \(t\bar{t}\) events is taken from MC samples of events generated with Powheg-Box v1 [23, 24] and the CT10 PDF set [25]. These events are interfaced with Pythia6[26] for simulation of the parton shower, hadronization, and the underlying event. The normalization of the \(t\bar{t}\) background in Ref. [8] is extracted from a fit to the leading large-\(R\) jet mass distribution in the \(13\) TeV data [27].

Samples of simulated multijet background events are generated to derive scaling functions to be applied to the background predictions from the \(13\) TeV data analysis. These samples are generated at both \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Two different sets of MC samples are used to study the impact of differences in jet flavor composition on the multijet background scaling functions. The first set of events corresponds to the \(2\to 2\) processes \(pp\to jj\) (with \(j=g\) or \(q\)) generated with Pythia8 with truth jet \(p_{\text{T}}\) in the range between \(400\) and \(2500\) GeV. The second set of events corresponds to the \(2\to 4\) processes \(pp\to bbbb\) generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO requiring \(b\)-quarks to have \(p_{\text{T}}\) above \(100\) GeV and at least one \(b\)-quark with \(p_{\rm T}\) above 200. For both sets, the events are interfaced with Pythia8 to simulate the parton shower, hadronization, and the underlying event.

## 4 Event reconstruction and selection

The truth-level events produced by the event generators with parton shower, hadronization, and underlying event as described in the previous section are processed with a reconstruction that builds a series of different jet collections. Large-radius jets are built from generated particles with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [28] operating with a radius parameter \(R=1.0\), then trimmed [29] by reclustering the jet with the \(k_{t}\) algorithm into \(R=0.2\) subjets and removing those subjets with \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm subjet}/p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}<0.05\), where \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm subjet}\) is the transverse momentum of the subjet and \(p_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}\) that of the original jet. Previous studies indicate that the trimming effectively removes the impact of pileup up to \(\mu=300\)[30]. Small-radius jets are built from generated charged particles with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm and a radius of \(R=0.2\). Only charged particles with \(p_{\rm T}>0.5\) are used in the clustering to emulate the track jets [31] used in the 13 data analysis.

The detector response for the truth-level analysis is simulated with a set of functions providing a parameterized response derived from fully-simulated event samples. This includes efficiency maps for jets of different quark flavors to satisfy the \(b\)-tagging requirements of the  algorithm [32] at the 70% working point (i.e. the \(b\)-tagging efficiency for \(b\)-quarks in a sample of simulated \(t\overline{t}\) events is equal to 70%) for both the 13 data and future HL-LHC detector conditions, the latter being evaluated with an average pileup of \(\mu=200\). For the same \(b\)-tagging 70% working point, the rejection of charm and light jets improves by a factor of \(\sim\)2 and \(\sim\)2.5, respectively, for the HL-LHC detector relative to the Run 2 detector relevant to the 13 data analysis. More information about the \(b\)-tagging performance can be found in Section 3.2.2 of Ref. [11].

The event selection applied to the truth-level analysis proceeds similarly to that used for the 13 data analysis and is summarized below:

* **Trigger:** Events are required to have at least one large-radius jet reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a radius \(R=1.0\) and with \(p_{\rm T}>420\). The trigger requirement is 100% efficient for signal events passing the selection described below. Trigger studies for the HL-LHC on-line system indicate that it will be possible to maintain the \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold for large-\(R\) jets at values as low or lower than that for the 13 data taking (see Section 6.11 in Ref. [15]).
* **2 large-\(R\) jets:** The event must contain two large-\(R\) jets with \(p_{\rm T}>250\), mass \(m_{\rm J}>50\), and \(|\eta|<2.0\). The leading jet must have \(p_{\rm T}>450\) to guarantee 100% trigger efficiency.
* **Rapidity separation:** The pseudorapidity separation between the leading and subleading large-\(R\) jets must satisfy \(|\Delta\eta|<1.7\) to suppress multijet background processes.
* **Track jets:** The leading and subleading large-\(R\) jets must contain at least one track jet each to be considered as Higgs boson candidates. The track jets are associated with the large-\(R\) jets via ghost association [33; 34].
* \(b\)**-tagging:** Events are classified by the number of \(b\)-tagged track jets associated with the leading and subleading large-\(R\) jets, other large-\(R\) jets are not considered in the event selection. Two-tag events are characterized by the presence of exactly one \(b\)-tagged track jet in each of the two large-\(R\) jets. Three-tag events have exactly one \(b\)-tagged track jet in one large-\(R\) jet and two in the other large-\(R\) jet. Four-tag events have exactly two \(b\)-tagged track jets in each of the two large-\(R\) jets. It should be noted that the \(b\)-tagging requirement is applied via weights that correspond to the probability for a given large-\(R\) jet to contain zero, one, two, or more \(b\)-tagged track jets. The individual track jet \(b\)-tagging probability is given by the corresponding \(b\)-tagging efficiency, which depends on the true quark flavor of each track jet.
* **Higgs mass:** The masses of the leading large-\(R\) jet (\(m_{\mathrm{J}}^{\mathrm{lead}}\)) and subleading large-\(R\) jet (\(m_{\mathrm{J}}^{\mathrm{subl}}\)) must be consistent with the Higgs boson mass: \(X_{HH}<1.6\), to optimize the search sensitivity, see Eq. (1) below: \[X_{HH}\ =\ \sqrt{\left(\frac{m_{\mathrm{J}}^{\mathrm{lead}}\ -\ 125\,\mathrm{GeV}}{0.1\ m_{ \mathrm{J}}^{\mathrm{lead}}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{m_{\mathrm{J}}^{\mathrm{subl }}\ -\ 120\,\mathrm{GeV}}{0.1\ m_{\mathrm{J}}^{\mathrm{subl}}}\right)^{2}}\.\] (1) The peak values are set to be 125 GeV and 120 GeV for the leading and subleading large-\(R\) jets, respectively, in the simulated samples to match the peak positions in the truth-level analysis (this differs slightly from the full-simulation analysis). A lower peak value is set for the subleading large-\(R\) jets due primarily to energy carried away by neutrinos from semileptonic decays.

Three regions in the plane formed by the leading large-\(R\) jet mass and the subleading large-\(R\) jet mass are used in the analysis. The signal region (SR) is defined by the requirement \(X_{HH}<1.6\) and the control region (CR) is defined by the requirements \(R_{HH}=\sqrt{\left(m_{\mathrm{J}}^{\mathrm{lead}}\ -\ 125\,\mathrm{GeV} \right)^{2}+\left(m_{\mathrm{J}}^{\mathrm{subl}}\ -\ 120\,\mathrm{GeV} \right)^{2}}<33\) GeV and \(X_{HH}\geq 1.6\). The sideband region (SB) is defined by the requirements \(R_{HH}\geq 33\) GeV and \(\sqrt{\left(m_{\mathrm{J}}^{\mathrm{lead}}\ -\ 135\,\mathrm{GeV} \right)^{2}+\left(m_{\mathrm{J}}^{\mathrm{subl}}\ -\ 130\,\mathrm{GeV} \right)^{2}}<58\) GeV. The choices made to define the control and sideband regions are driven by the need to select events that are kinematically similar to those in the signal region while providing sufficiently large samples to derive the background estimate from the sideband region and validate it in the control region. These regions are depicted in Figure 1 which shows a two-dimensional distribution in the leading-subleading large-\(R\) jet mass plane for the dijet MC sample at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV.

For the 13 TeV data analysis, the dominant multijet background is estimated with a data-driven approach which utilizes events with a smaller number of \(b\)-tags in the sideband region. The events used for this estimation are required to have the same track-jet topology as in the event categories they are used to model the background as illustrated in Figure 2. Events with 1 \(b\)-tag are used to model the background in the 2-tag category. Likewise, events with 2 \(b\)-tags are used to model the background in the 3- and 4-tag categories.

The inner-most contour delineates the signal region (SR). The control region (CR) lies between the inner and middle contours whereas the sideband region (SB) lies between the middle and outer contours.

## 5 Validation against 13 TeV data analysis

To validate the truth-level analysis described above, the acceptance times efficiency \(A\times\epsilon\) is compared with results from the 13 TeV data analysis [8]. Table 1 presents \(A\times\epsilon\) at successive stages of event selection (see Section 4) for the signal samples. It is found that the truth-level analysis emulates the 13 TeV data analysis fairly well for the \(m=2.0\) TeV and 3.0 TeV signal samples used as a test. Perfect agreement is not required since the truth-level analysis is only used to derive scaling functions based on relative changes in normalization or shape of the dijet mass distributions rather than to derive absolute predictions for signal and background event yields.

The invariant mass distribution for the combination of leading and subleading large-\(R\) jets is shown in Figure 3 for signal events with \(m=2.0\) and 3.0 TeV in the 2-tag, 3-tag, and 4-tag categories. Distributions for the truth-level analysis are normalized to those for the 13 TeV data analysis. A slight offset is observed which is due to a different treatment of large-\(R\) jets in the full detector simulation and reconstruction and in the truth-level analysis. However, this does not affect the scaling of signal events used for the HL-LHC projection appreciably.

The 13 TeV data analysis can be further utilized to check the multijet background simulation used here for scaling purposes. For this check, the \(t\overline{t}\) background shape and normalization are taken from the 13 TeV data analysis while the multijet background shapes are taken from the truth-level analysis with a normalization provided by the 13 TeV data analysis such that the sum of the multijet and \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds matches the number of data events in the combined signal and control regions (see Figure 4). There is good agreement in the shapes of the dijet mass distributions for both the dijet and \(4b\) multijet MC samples described in Section 3.2, although the former does suffer from a limited number of events in the 4-tag category.1

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \hline Requirement & \multicolumn{2}{c}{signal (\(m=2.0\) TeV)} & \multicolumn{2}{c}{signal (\(m=3.0\) TeV)} \\ \cline{2-5}  & truth analysis & 13 TeV analysis & truth analysis & 13 TeV analysis \\ \hline Trigger & 1.00 & 1.00 & 1.00 & 1.00 \\ Two large-\(R\) jets & 0.85 & 0.80 & 0.87 & 0.86 \\ Large-\(R\) jet \(\Delta\eta\) & 0.81 & 0.76 & 0.83 & 0.82 \\ At least 2 \(b\)-tagged track jets & 0.66 & 0.59 & 0.46 & 0.43 \\ \(X_{HH}<1.6\) (SR) & 0.23 & 0.26 & 0.14 & 0.17 \\ \hline
2-tag SR (incl. same jet) & 0.086 & 0.090 & 0.083 & 0.116 \\
2-tag SR & 0.057 & – & 0.057 & – \\
3-tag SR & 0.097 & 0.113 & 0.042 & 0.038 \\

\end{table}

The acceptance times efficiency is only available for the broader 2-tag category that includes events in which both \(b\)-tagged track jets are associated with the same large-\(R\) jet in the case of the 13 TeV data analysis.

[8] and the truth-level analysis. The histograms for the truth-level analysis are normalized to those from Ref. [8].

The \(t\bar{t}\) background comes from the 13 TeV data analysis in Ref. [8]. The multijet background comes from the truth-level analysis and corresponds to the \(pp\to jj\) process generated with Pythia8 (left) or \(pp\to bbbbb\) process generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (right) normalized such that the total background matches the number of events observed in the data.

Figure 5 presents the dijet mass distributions in the signal and control regions combined for the multijet background predicted by either the "dijet" multijet background generated with Pythia8 or the "\(4b\)" multijet background generated with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO as described in Section 3.2. The distributions are normalized to the number of events estimated with the 13 TeV data. There is good agreement in the shape of the dijet mass distributions produced with either event generator. This indicates that either multijet simulation can be used reliably to predict the shape of the dijet mass distributions. However, differences in the flavor content of the large-\(R\) jets in the dijet and \(4b\) multijet MC samples do affect the predicted background yields in the following study and the two samples are used to extract a range of projections at the HL-LHC.

The distributions are extracted from the truth-level analysis and normalized to the predicted multijet event yields from the 13 TeV data analysis.

## 6 Projection for HL-LHC

The projection for the HL-LHC proceeds as follows:

1. Dijet mass distributions for signal and both multijet and background events from the 13 TeV data analysis in Ref. [8] are scaled from 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).
2. Background distributions are further scaled with mass-dependent functions to extrapolate from \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV to 14 TeV. These functions take into account both increases in cross section and changes in detector performance from the Run 2 ATLAS detector (as applicable to Ref. [8]) to the future upgraded detector at the HL-LHC. The functions are obtained separately for the 2-, 3-, and 4-tag categories in two steps. First, the dijet mass distributions are extracted from the truth-level analysis of multijet MC events with the Run 2 detector at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV and with the HL-LHC detector at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, normalized using the same integrated luminosity. An example of such distributions is shown in Figure 6 for the 3-tag category. Lower event yields are obtained for the 14 TeV dijet MC sample in Figure 6(a) due to the stronger rejection of charm- and light-jets with the HL-LHC detector, despite a higher cross section relative to 13 TeV. Second, the ratio between the \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and 13 TeV distributions is fit with a low-order polynomial that serves as the scaling function. The differences in cross section values amount to a \(\sim\)25% average increase in the kinematic region relevant to this study. Signal distributions are scaled by the ratio of calculated cross sections at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and 13 TeV for each resonance mass value employed in the statistical analysis. The signal cross section increases linearly as a function of the resonance mass, yielding an increase growing from 26% at 1 TeV to 58% at 3 TeV [20].
3. Further mass-dependent scaling is applied to all signal and background distributions to reflect improvements in the reconstruction of highly boosted jets, as obtained by using variable-radius

Figure 6: Dijet mass distributions for 3-tag events at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV and 14 TeV in the combined signal+control+sideband region for (a) the dijet and (b) the \(4b\) multijet MC samples. The distributions are extracted from the truth-level analysis and normalized to the predicted multijet event yields obtained using the cross sections computed by the event generators. The distributions are only used to derive scaling functions from fits to the ratio of the two distributions.

track jets [35] instead of fixed-radius (\(R=0.2\)) track jets, or in the background suppression by applying a requirement on the maximum number of charged particles associated with each large-\(R\) jet. Different scalings are applied depending on the number of \(b\)-tags. These additional scalings are discussed in more detail below.

Scaling functions derived from the truth-level analysis of the multijet MC samples are applied equally to multijet and \(t\overline{t}\) dijet mass distributions from the 13 TeV data analysis in Ref. [8]. Events in a combined signal+control+sideband region are used to enlarge the number of MC events available to derive these scaling functions.

The first improvement relative to the 13 TeV data analysis arises from the use of variable-radius track jets. This circumvents the problem that \(R=0.2\) track jets from the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay start merging for Higgs boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) values larger than approximately \(2m_{H}/R=1250\GeV\). As an illustration, the dijet mass distributions for 3-tag events in the dijet and 4\(b\) multijet MC samples are shown in Figure 7 for each choice of track jet algorithm. Distributions for signal MC events with \(m(G_{\mathrm{KK}})=3.0\TeV\) are shown in Figure 8(a). A consequence of using variable-radius track jets is that \(A\times\epsilon\) remains essentially unchanged for 2-tag events but increases appreciably for 3-tag and especially 4-tag events as the resonance mass increases, as shown in Figure 8(b).

Dijet mass distributions from the 13 TeV data analysis for signal and background events are scaled with mass-dependent functions to account for the change in \(A\times\epsilon\) due to the use of variable-radius track jets. Separate signal and background functions are derived for the different numbers of \(b\)-tags. Background functions are derived from the 4\(b\) multijet MC sample and found to agree statistically with those derived from the dijet MC sample, indicating weak dependence on the flavor composition of the jets. Both signal and background event yields show increases for 3-tag and 4-tag events, although the increase is more pronounced for signal events and thus the search sensitivity improves by reconstructing track jets with a variable radius.

Figure 7: Dijet mass distributions from the truth-level analysis for 3-tag events with fixed-radius (\(R=0.2\)) and variable-radius track jets in the combined signal+control+sideband region for (a) the dijet and (b) the 4\(b\) multijet MC samples. The distributions are extracted from the truth-level analysis and normalized to the predicted multijet event yields obtained using the cross sections computed by the event generators. The distributions are only used to derive scaling functions from fits to the ratio of the two distributions.

The second improvement relative to the 13 TeV data analysis is the requirement of a maximum number of charged particles associated with large-\(R\) jets to exploit differences between quark- and gluon-initiated jets, the latter being an important component of the multijet background. A distribution of the number of associated charged particles shows a clear separation between signal and background contributions (see Figure 9). The impact of pileup at \(\mu=200\) has been studied for charged particle tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV associated with the primary vertex (see Section 3 of Ref. [11]). In the case of \(t\bar{t}\) events, the average number of tracks associated with the primary vertex increases by about 15% due to pileup. Further pileup suppression is possible with additional requirements on the longitudinal impact parameter or track-vertex association probability.

(b) Ratio of acceptance times efficiency values for variable-radius track jets relative to fixed-radius track jets for 2-tag, 3-tag, and 4-tag events as a function of \(G_{\mathrm{KK}}\) mass in the bulk RS model MC samples at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV.

Figure 9: Large-\(R\) jet charged particle multiplicity distributions from the truth-level analysis for events with variable-radius track jets in the combined signal+control+sideband region for signal events with \(m(G_{\mathrm{KK}})=2.0\) TeV and \(m(G_{\mathrm{KK}})=3.0\) TeV, as well as dijet and \(4b\) multijet MC samples, at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Charged particles are required with have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV and be within \(\Delta R<0.6\) of the large-\(R\) jet.

Both leading and subleading large-\(R\) jets are required to have fewer than 20 charged particles with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV and \(\Delta R<0.6\) with respect to the jet axis. This additional requirement retains approximately 80% of the signal events in the signal region, with little dependence on the number of \(b\)-tags or the resonance mass. The impact of this requirement is considerably larger on multijet background events than it is on signal events, as illustrated in Figures 10 and 11, which show the dijet mass distributions for background and signal events with 3 \(b\)-tags. The reduction in background level increases with dijet mass. The mass-dependent scaling functions derived from the \(4b\) multijet MC sample provide a smaller degree of improvement in sensitivity of the analysis since the impact of the charged multiplicity requirement is more pronounced in the case of the dijet MC sample.

The dijet mass distributions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) resulting from the scaling procedure described above, including variable-radius track jets and the requirement on the maximum number of charged particles per large-\(R\) jet, are shown in Figure 12.

## 7 Statistical analysis and results

The statistical analysis uses a test statistic based on the profile likelihood ratio [36] with a signal strength parameter equal to \(\sigma/\sigma_{\mathrm{model}}\). If no discovery is made, exclusion limits are set with the asymptotic assumption and following the \(\mathrm{CL_{s}}\) method [37]. Signal strength values are excluded at the 95% confidence level if the \(\mathrm{CL_{s}}\) value is smaller than 0.05. The 2-tag, 3-tag, and 4-tag categories are combined in the analysis.

The full set of systematic uncertainties from the 13 TeV data analysis is included in the statistical analysis. These comprise theoretical uncertainties in the signal acceptance as well as experimental uncertainties affecting the large-\(R\) jet reconstruction (both scale and resolution uncertainties in the jet energy and mass) and the \(b\)-tagging efficiencies. Also included are uncertainties in the shape and normalization of the

Figure 10: Dijet mass distributions from the truth-level analysis for 3-tag events before and after the requirement on number of charged particles associated with the large-\(R\) jets for (a) the dijet and (b) the \(4b\) multijet MC samples. The distributions are normalized to the predicted multijet event yields obtained using the cross sections computed by the event generators. The distributions are only used to derive scaling functions from fits to the ratio of the two distributions.

multijet and \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds. Further details are available in Ref. [8]. The dominant uncertainties in the signal event yields arise from \(b\)-tagging and large-\(R\) jet mass resolution, whereas for the background event yields they arise from the data-driven estimate.

For the signal, the HL-LHC extrapolation assumes the following reduction in systematic uncertainties: the \(b\)-tagging efficiency and large-\(R\) jet mass resolution uncertainties are reduced by factors of 3 and 2, respectively, relative to the 13  data analysis. A 1% uncertainty is assumed for the measurement of the integrated luminosity, which has negligible impact on the sensitivity. A reduction by a factor of 3 is assumed for all other sources of uncertainty--the most important sub-dominant sources of uncertainty are the jet energy scale and resolution as well as the jet mass scale. For the background, the HL-LHC extrapolation assumes that the background estimate uncertainties are fully driven by the statistical uncertainties in the samples used in the estimate and thus scale according to \(1/\sqrt{N}\).

The expected 95% CL cross section upper limits for the 13  data analysis with 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and the HL-LHC projection at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Figure 13. The limits for the 13  data analysis with 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) presented here are not identical to those from Ref. [8] since the latter also include the resolved \(b\bar{b}b\bar{b}\)  channel which contributes the most at lower resonance mass. For resonance masses above 1, the merged channel considered here dominates the sensitivity of the search.

Upper limits on \(\sigma\times\mathcal{B}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) range from 1.44 fb (1.82 fb) at a mass of 1.0 to 0.025 fb (0.040 fb) at a mass of 3.0 when dijet (\(4b\)) scaling and the variable-radius track jets with a maximum requirement on the number of charged particles are applied. The benefit from the use of variable-radius track jets becomes significant at the highest resonance masses considered here, with an improvement in the upper limits of at least 24% (depending on the choice of scaling) at 3.0. Addition of a requirement on the maximum number of charged particles further improves the upper limits by factors of about 20% and 45% at masses of 2.0 and 3.0, respectively. Systematic uncertainties have a modest impact on the limits with an effect of at most 20% at 1.0 and decreasing to \(\sim 5\%\) at high mass. A hypothetical relative improvement of 10% in the \(b\)-tagging efficiency for true \(b\)-jets with unchanged charm- and light-jet rejection yields improvements in the limits of at most 12% when \(4b\) scaling is assumed, with more modest gains when dijet scaling is assumed.

Figure 11: Dijet mass distributions for 3-tag events with variable-radius track jets for signal events in the signal region for the bulk RS model \(m(G_{\text{KK}})=3.0\) MC sample before and after the requirement on the number of charged particles associated with the large-\(R\) jets.

The lower mass limits on KK gravitons improve from the current 1.36 TeV at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV to 2.95 TeV (2.75 TeV) at the HL-LHC in the scenario with coupling \(k/\overline{M}_{\rm Pl}=1.0\). In the case of \(k/\overline{M}_{\rm Pl}=0.5\), no limit can be set with the 13 TeV data analysis but a lower limit of 2.15 TeV (2.00 TeV) can be set at the HL-LHC given a multijet background scaling modeled with the dijet (\(4b\) multijet) MC samples. These values are summarized in Table 2. Higher sensitivity is obtained for projections with scaling functions derived from the dijet MC samples due to the mix of different quark flavors in multijet events and the significant improvement in charm- and light-jet rejection expected with the upgraded HL-LHC detector. The projection obtained with the dijet MC sample is taken as the primary estimate of the analysis sensitivity at the HL-LHC, as this sample better approximates the relative fractions of 2-, 3-, and 4-tag events in the 13 TeV data analysis. This is likely due to the mix of different quark flavors in that sample. The projection obtained with the \(4b\) multijet MC sample, which assumes the multijet background to be of irreducible four \(b\)-quark composition with no charm- or light-flavor contribution, provides a more conservative estimate of the analysis sensitivity.

[8] & dijet scaling & \(4b\) scaling \\ \hline \(k/\overline{M}_{\rm Pl}=0.5\) & no limit & 2.15 TeV & 2.00 TeV \\ \(k/\overline{M}_{\rm Pl}=1.0\) & 1.36 TeV & 2.95 TeV & 2.75 TeV \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The event yields for signal events at \(G_{\text{KK}}\) masses of 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 TeV are scaled up for visibility.

## 8 Conclusions

A study exploring the search potential for high-mass resonances decaying into a pair of Higgs bosons at the high-luminosity LHC with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is presented. The search exploits the large \(H\to b\bar{b}\) branching fraction and the reconstruction of highly boosted Higgs bosons with large-radius jets and \(b\)-tagged track subjets to discriminate the signal from the dominant multijet background. The prospects for the HL-LHC are obtained by extrapolating the results of the analysis of 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV with scaling functions derived from a truth-level analysis. Cross section upper limits as low as 0.025 fb are projected at resonance masses near 3.0 TeV, with lower mass limits on the KK graviton as high as 2.15 TeV and 2.95 TeV in the benchmark bulk Randall-Sundrum model with a warped extra dimension and \(k/\overline{M}_{\rm Pl}=0.5\) and 1.0, respectively. All limits are evaluated at the 95% confidence level. The study is limited to the resonance mass range between 1.0 and 3.0 TeV due to the extrapolation procedure followed here. Future searches will investigate the higher resonance mass region as well.
