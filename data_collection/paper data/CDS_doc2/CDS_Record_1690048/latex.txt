Introduction

Many interesting physics processes produce the vector bosons \(Z\) or \(W\), or the scalar Higgs boson. These particles have their largest branching fractions into hadrons, but these decay modes are very difficult to observe at the LHC due to the very large backgrounds from jets originating from light quarks and gluons, referred to as "QCD jets" throughout this note. Since the cross-section for vector boson production typically falls less rapidly with transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) than that of the background, the signal to background ratio can be improved by requiring the boson-candidate jet to have large \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\). In this case, due to the Lorentz boost, the boson's decay products are typically reconstructed as a single jet. Many techniques have been developed to explore the substructure of the jet and identify the case in which a jet is a good candidate for being formed from a two-body decay. In parallel, grooming techniques such as trimming [1, 2], pruning [3, 4, 5] and filtering [6] have been developed to remove the soft components of a jet, reducing the effects of pileup and the underlying event. Some algorithms, like mass-drop-filtering [6], can act as both a jet groomer and as a tagger for two-body decays.

This note explores the performance of techniques aimed at improving the efficiency and background rejection of boosted boson identification in combination with a series of jet grooming techniques. The first part is a study based on Monte Carlo simulation, where the signal is \(W\) bosons produced in pairs in the decay of massive, exotic particles (Kaluza-Klein gravitons [7, 8, 9]) and the backgrounds are jets produced in association with Standard Model \(W\) bosons. We show signal and background distributions for relevant discriminating variables, as well as 'ROC' (Receiver Operating Characteristics) curves where the signal efficiency is plotted against the background rejection for several taggers, including Q-jets volatility [10], N-subjettiness [11] and other jet substructure variables.

The second part of the note focuses on comparisons with data. \(W\) bosons from top decays can be selected with high purity (\(\approx 98\%\)) using the HEPTopTagger algorithm [12, 13], and these events are used to assess the agreement between data and Monte Carlo simulation for some relevant jet substructure variables. These studies have been performed using data taken by the ATLAS detector in 2012 with a centre-of-mass energy of 8. Events are selected as in the ATLAS boosted top analysis [14]. Monte Carlo simulations that use beam and detector conditions for that year are used. The selection of boosted \(W\) bosons using the HEPTopTagger may introduce a bias towards one \(W\)-tagger with respect to another, and this will be studied in the future in more detail. However, the goal of this study is to assess the agreement between data and Monte Carlo for the various variables, rather than to assess the performance of different \(W\)-taggers in the HEPTopTagger-enriched samples.

The note is organised as follows. Section 2 introduces the jet clustering algorithms, grooming techniques and jet substructure variables used for hadronic \(W\) tagging. Section 3 describes the ATLAS detector, the 2012 dataset and simulation samples, and the event selections used to identify hadronic \(W\)s from MC and \(t\bar{t}\) enriched data. Section 4 presents the different event selections for the Monte Carlo studies and the data comparisons. Section 5 presents the jet grooming performance and the jet mass response. Section 6 compares the \(W\) tagging efficiency and background rejection in simulation for various groomed jet substructure selections using a signal sample of boosted \(W\) bosons and a background sample of light quarks and gluons. Finally, Section 7 uses \(W\) bosons contained in large-\(R\) groomed jets in \(t\bar{t}\) events to test the modelling of data by the simulation.

## 2 Jet Algorithms, Groomers and Taggers

Calorimeter jets are reconstructed from three-dimensional topo-clusters [15] which have been calibrated using the Local Cluster Weighting (LCW) calibration [16]. In MC simulated samples, truth jets are built from generated particles that have a lifetime larger than 10 ps, excluding muons and neutrinos. For these studies, we consider jets reconstructed using the Cambridge-Aachen (C/A) algorithm [17], and the anti \(k_{t}\) algorithm [18]. The \(k_{t}\) algorithm [19, 20] is also used in this note in the HEPTopTagger algorithm and one variation of the jet pruning algorithms.

### Substructure Variables for use in \(W\)-tagging:

For these studies we consider a set of seven jet substructure variables for use in hadronic \(W\) identification, listed below. The angular separation of objects \(i,j\) in the \((y,\phi)\) space is defined as \(\Delta R_{ij}=\sqrt{(y_{i}-y_{j})^{2}+(\phi_{i}-\phi_{j})^{2}}\).

* **Splitting scale**[21] The splitting scale, \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\), is calculated for a jet (re)clustered with the \(k_{t}\)-clustering algorithm, and is the \(k_{t}\) distance between the two proto-jets of the final clustering step: \[\sqrt{d_{12}}=\min(p_{T1},p_{T2})\times\Delta R_{12}.\] (1) The \(k_{t}\) algorithm combines the hardest proto-jets at the last step of clustering, so \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) can distinguish the products of the \(W\) boson, which tend to have a symmetric energy distribution, from QCD jets which are more asymmetric on average.
* **Momentum balance**[6] The momentum balance, \(\sqrt{y_{\mathrm{f}}}\), is defined as the ratio between the splitting scale defined above, and the jet mass of the final clustering step: \[\sqrt{y_{\mathrm{f}}}=\frac{\min(p_{\mathrm{T1}},p_{\mathrm{T2}})}{m_{12}} \Delta R_{12}.\] (2)
* **Mass-drop**[6] The mass-drop fraction, \(\mu_{12}\), is also defined at the last step of recombination where two 'proto-jets' are combined to form one 'jet'. \(\mu_{12}\) is the fraction of mass carried by the most massive proto-jet: \[\mu_{12}=\frac{\max(m_{1},m_{2})}{m_{12}}\] (3)
* **Jet width**[22] The jet width is the first radial moment in \((\eta,\phi)\) space weighted by \(p_{T}\). Symbolically: \[w=\frac{\sum_{i}\Delta R_{ij}p_{Ti}}{\sum_{i}p_{Ti}},\] (4) where \(J\) denotes the jet axis, and \(i\) runs over the set of constituents of the jet. Jet mass and jet width are related, but as a dimensionless quantity the jet width may be less sensitive to the uncertainties in the overall energy scale.
* **Planar flow**[23] Planar flow is a measure of how uniformly spread out the energy of a jet is perpendicular to its axis. Denoted \(P\), planar flow is computed as \[P=4\times\mathrm{det}(I)/\mathrm{Tr}(I)^{2},\] (5) where \(I\) is a two-dimensional matrix of momentum correlations defined as \(I_{ab}=\frac{1}{M}\sum_{i}\frac{p_{i,a}p_{i,b}}{E_{i}}\). The index \(i\) runs over the set of constituents of a jet and the \(a,b\) indices represent the components of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the \(i^{\mathrm{th}}\) constituent perpendicular to the jet axis. A typical QCD jet is characterised by the planar flow near 1, in contrast to a smaller value expected for the localised two-prong structure of \(W\) jets.

* **N-subjettiness**[11] The jet shape variable "N-subjettiness" describes to what degree the substructure of a given jet resembles \(N\) or fewer subjets. The parameter \(\tau_{N}\) is used to describe the substructure and is defined as \[\tau_{N}=\frac{\sum_{k}p_{\text{T},k}(\min\{\Delta R_{1,k},\Delta R_{2,k},...,R _{N,k}\})^{\beta}}{\sum_{k}p_{\text{T}}(R_{0})^{\beta}}\] (6) where the sum runs over the constituents of the jet, \(p_{\text{T},k}\) is the momentum of constituent \(k\), \(\Delta R_{A,k}\) is the azimuth-rapidity distance between subjet axis \(A\) and particle \(k\) and \(R_{0}\) is the characteristic jet radius. The constant \(\beta\) is an angular weighting component, set to 1 for this study. While the \(\tau_{N}\) variables on their own are not particularly powerful at discriminating the number of hard subjets, the ratios \(\tau_{N}/\tau_{N-1}\) are powerful discriminants of jets containing \(N\) hard subjets. In this note, \(\tau_{2}/\tau_{1}\) is used to highlight the two-body structure of a jet coming from \(W\) decays.
* **Q-jets mass volatility**[24] For a jet clustered with a given recombination jet clustering algorithm, the Q-jets technique reclusters the jet many times with a degree of randomness. Following this, any jet observable, such as the mass, will have a distribution for a given jet. At a given step in clustering, the probability that a pair is clustered is proportional to \[\omega_{ij}(\alpha)=\exp\left\{-\alpha\frac{\Delta R_{ij}^{2}-\Delta R_{\text{ min}}^{2}}{\Delta R_{\text{min}}^{2}}\right\},\] (7) where the rigidity \(\alpha\in\mathbb{R}\) controls the level of randomness. A value of \(\alpha=0.1\) was optimised in Ref. [10] and adopted in this study. The high mass in \(W\) jets tends to persist during the re-clustering while the mass of QCD jets fluctuates. A sensitive observable to this trend is the coefficient of variation of the mass distribution for a single jet, called the volatility: \[\nu_{\text{QJets}}=\frac{\sqrt{\langle m^{2}\rangle-\langle m\rangle^{2}}}{ \langle m\rangle}.\] (8)

### Jet Grooming Algorithms for use in \(W\)-tagging:

Five different definitions of jets, corresponding to different combinations of clustering and grooming, are considered in the studies presented here. These are described illustratively in Figure 1 and listed below with a brief description of why they are selected for comparison in this note.

* **Trimmed**[1, 2]: anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=1.0\) trimmed jets with \(f_{\text{cut}}>5\%\) and \(R_{\text{subjet}}=0.3\). Subjets are reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with a parameter \(R_{\text{subjet}}\), and removed if they carry less than \(f_{\text{cut}}\) of the jet \(p_{T}\). Trimming has been studied in depth in ATLAS [2] and was found to be effective at uncovering hard substructure and stable with respect to varying pileup conditions.
* **BDRS**[6]: C/A, \(R=1.2\) jets, split with \(\mu_{12}<\frac{2}{3}\) and \(\sqrt{y_{\text{f}}}>0.3\) and filtered with \(R_{\text{subjet}}=\min(0.3,R_{12}/2)\). Here \(\mu_{12}\) is the'mass-drop' and \(y_{\text{f}}\) is the momentum balance. The BDRS jet tagging method decomposes C/A jets back through clustering steps to search for hard structure within the large-\(R\) jet. The jet \(J\) at a given stage of the cluster history is decomposed into two subjets: \(j_{1}\) and \(j_{2}\). If there is a significant mass drop, \(\mu_{12}<\mu_{max}=2/3\), and the momentum is balanced (\(\sqrt{y_{\text{f}}}>0.3\)), then the parent jet is presumed to represent some hard structure and the procedure ends by returning this jet. If the cuts fail then the highest mass subjet is taken as the new parent jet and the procedure continues. The filtering step consists in removing the radiation not belonging to the last three subjets in the clustering process. In this way the BDRS method works its way back through the clustering steps of the C/A jet until it reaches the hard structure. As with trimmed jets, this configuration of jets has been studied in depth in ATLAS [2] and was found to be performant.

* **BDRS-A**: C/A, \(R=1.2\), split with \(\sqrt{y_{\mathrm{f}}}>0.2\), and filtered with a fixed \(R_{\mathrm{subjet}}=0.3\). The modified BDRS tagger, referred to here as BDRS-A, follows the same procedure as the original BDRS tagger but removes the mass drop requirement, loosens the momentum balance cut, and fixes the subjet radius used in the filtering stage. This is a relatively new approach.
* **C/A-pruned**: C/A, \(R=0.8\) jets clustered with the C/A algorithm and pruned with \(d_{\mathrm{cut}}>m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\) or \(z_{\mathrm{cut}}<0.1\). Here \(d_{\mathrm{cut}}\) is the angular distance between the two objects being considered for clustering by the jet algorithm; \(z_{\mathrm{cut}}\) is the fraction of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the potential clustered pair carried by the softer of the two objects being considered. This is the grooming algorithm found to be the most performant in [5] for the purposes of \(W\)-tagging, and has also been used by ATLAS for the Q-jets analysis [10], but no specific calibration has been made in that context.
* \(k_{t}\)**-pruned**: C/A, \(R=0.8\) jets reclustered with the \(k_{t}\) algorithm and pruned with \(d_{\mathrm{cut}}>m/p_{\mathrm{T}}\) or \(z_{\mathrm{cut}}<0.1\). This is the variation of pruning that has been previously studied in detail in Ref. [2]. dedicated calibrations or uncertainties currently exist in ATLAS for \(k_{t}\)-pruning.

Explicit calibrations and systematic uncertainties only exist for the first two jet collections, trimmed anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=1.0\) and BDRS C/A, \(R=1.2\), from previous ATLAS studies. For the other algorithms, the jets are used directly after clustering the topoclusters (that are calibrated), with no additional modifications. A comparison is shown with truth-level jets for all algorithms, but comparison with data is only shown for the algorithms where specific calibrations and systematics are present.

## 3 The ATLAS Detector and data sample

ATLAS [25] is a multi-purpose detector designed to study proton-proton collisions in a high-luminosity environment at the LHC. It has cylindrical structure with nearly hermetic coverage. It comprises a precision tracking system at the innermost part, highly segmented electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and a large muon spectrometer. The inner detector (ID) covers the region \(|\eta|<2.5\)1 and is composed of silicon pixel and microstrip detectors and a transition radiation tracker that uses drift tubes. The ID is surrounded by a 2 T superconducting solenoidal magnet. The electromagnetic calorimeter is located outside the solenoid and covers the range up to \(|\eta|=3.2\). It uses liquid argon (LAr) as the active detector material and lead plates as the passive absorber. A scintillating tile sampling calorimeter within \(|\eta|<1.7\) and a LAr calorimeter between \(1.5<|\eta|<4.9\) are used for hadronic and forward energy measurements. The ID and calorimeters are surrounded by a muon spectrometer (MS), which is composed of gas-filled precision tracking chambers up to \(|\eta|=2.7\) and trigger chambers up to \(|\eta|=2.4\). A toroidal magnetic field is generated by large barrel and end-cap air core magnets.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector, and the \(z\)-axis along the beam line. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upwards. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r\), \(\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam line. Pseudorapidity is defined as \(\eta=-\ln[\tan(\theta/2)]\) with the polar angle \(\theta\). Transverse momentum and energy are defined as \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=p\sin\theta\) and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}=E\sin\theta\), respectively.

The dataset used in the analyses presented in this note corresponds to \(20.3\pm 0.6\)\(\mathrm{\,fb}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity [26] collected at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV and taken during periods in which the detector was operational. The ATLAS data quality criteria reject data with significant contamination from detector noise or problems in the read-out. These criteria are established separately for different detector regions, trigger conditions and physics objects being reconstructed (eg. jet, electron, muon). The primary systems of interest in these studies are the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters.

A three-level trigger system is used to select interesting events. The Level 1 trigger is implemented in hardware and uses a subset of detector information to reduce the event rate to the design value of at most 
Figure 1: Illustrations depicting the grooming algorithms utilised in this note. The clustering shown in (a) is illustrated for the \(\mathrm{C/A}\) algorithm, which clusters objects according to their angular separation with the closest pairs of objects being clustered first; anti-\(k_{t}\) weights the separations by \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) such that harder and closer objects are clustered first. The BDRS and BDRS-A algorithms follow the procedure depicted in (b), followed by filtering (c). Trimming is depicted in (c), and pruning in (d).

75 kHz. This is followed by two software-based triggers, Level 2 and the Event Filter, which together reduce the event rate to a few hundred Hz.

### Samples used to compare grooming and tagging efficiencies

Jets from hadronically decaying \(W\) bosons are selected from samples of spin 2 Kaluza-Klein gravitons (KKG) with masses of 0.4 - 2.0, in steps of 0.2. This sample has been chosen because it provides a pure sample of W bosons, and the BSM features of this model do not affect the selection. The KKG signal samples, based on the bulk Randall-Sundrum scenario proposed in Ref. [27], are produced with CalcHep v3.2[28] with the CTEQ6L1[29]PDF. The generated events are then passed to Pythia8[30] for parton showering and hadronization. The CalcHep generator keeps all spin information for the graviton and the decay into \(W\) bosons.

As a background sample, production of \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons in association with jets, from both light and heavy flavor quarks, is simulated using the Sherpa[31] generator and the CT10[32] PDF set.

### Samples used for data/MC comparisons

A sample of \(t\bar{t}\) events filtered for a lepton (at least one electron, muon or tau in the final state) are produced with the POWHEG-BOX 1.0[33, 34, 35] generator using the CT10 NLO PDF set[32] in the matrix element. This is interfaced to PYTHIA 6.425[36] for the hadronisation and underlying event models using the CTEQ6L1 PDF set and the Perugia 2011C tune[37, 38].

Additionally, several samples simulating the background to boosted \(t\bar{t}\) events are produced. Single-top-quark events in the s-channel final state \(t+j\), where the \(W\) bosons in the final state produced from the top quark are required to decay leptonically, are generated with MC@NLO[39, 40] using the CT10 NLO PDF set. Final-state parton showers are simulated and hadronised using the HERWIG 6.520.2[41] program interfaced to the JIMMY 4.31.3 underlying event model[42] with the ATLAS AUET2 tune[37, 38]. Events produced in the \(Wt\) channel, where all non-top originating \(W\) boson decay channels are produced, are also generated with MC@NLO and the same parton shower, PDF and tune as for the \(t+j\) s-channel. Events in the single top t-channel are generated with AcerMC[43] using the CTEQ6L1 PDF set, and are showered using PYTHIA 6.425 with the AUET2B tune[44]. Samples of \(W\)+jets and \(Z\)+jets events are produced with the ALPGEN 2.14[45] generator, using CTEQ6L1 PDFs, interfaced to PYTHIA 6.425 using the Perugia 2011C tune for parton showering and hadronisation. A scale factor of 0.8 applied to the normalization of the \(W\)+jets simulation sample which has been determined from data using the lepton charge asymmetry in \(t\bar{t}\) events[46, 47].

### Detector simulation and reconstruction

Generated events are passed through the full Geant4[48] detector simulation[49] and subsequently processed using the same reconstruction software as for data.

Pile-up interactions, which are \(pp\) collisions additional to those from the primary hard collision in an event, are simulated by overlaying additional unbiased \(pp\) collisions, which are generated with Pythia8. These extra events are overlaid onto the hard scattering events according to the measured distribution of the average number \(\langle\mu\rangle\) of \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing. The simulated proton bunches are organised in four trains of 36 bunches with a 50 ns spacing between the bunches. Therefore, the simulation also contains effects from out-of-time pile-up, i.e. the effects on the detector from the collision of neighbouring bunches to that where the event of interest occurred. The present dataset has \(\langle\mu\rangle\) values ranging between 6 and 40 with a mean of 20.

Event selection

As a preselection, only events that satisfy certain quality criteria on the detector operating conditions are retained. To reject non-collision backgrounds, events are required to contain at least one vertex consistent with the LHC beam spot, reconstructed from at least 2 tracks each with transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{track}}>400\). The data sample is selected by the primary single muon trigger chain, which is a logical OR of a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>24\) threshold, isolated muon trigger chain and a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>36\) threshold muon trigger chain without the isolation requirement. The longitudinal impact parameter of this muon with respect to the primary vertex having the highest \(\Sigma p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}\) of constituent tracks is required to be smaller than 2 mm. The muon is required to be isolated by requiring the ratio of the summed transverse track momentum within a cone of size \(\Delta R=10\) around the muon track to be less than 5% of the muon transverse momentum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\).

To select events with a leptonically decaying \(W\) boson, events are required to have missing transverse momentum \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>20\). Additionally, the scalar sum of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and the transverse mass of the leptonic \(W\) boson candidate must be \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}+m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}>60\), where \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}=\sqrt{2p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mu}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}( 1-\cos\Delta\phi)}\) is calculated from muon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) in the event, and the \(\Delta\phi\), the azimuthal angle between the muon candidate and the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\).

Two additional selections are applied, the first to Monte Carlo-only studies, and the other samples for data/Monte Carlo comparisons.

### Monte Carlo Studies of Boosted \(W\) Identification

To study boosted \(W\) identification in Monte Carlo simulation, we filter a sample of \(\mathrm{KKG}\to\mathrm{WW}\to\mathrm{l}\nu jj\) and a background sample of \(W\)+jets with the following requirements:

* Events contain a truth \(W\) boson decaying to muon and neutrino, \(W_{\mu\nu}\).
* The \(W_{\mu\nu}\), defined as the generator-level vector sum of the muon and the neutrino, has \(|\eta|<2.0\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>160\).
* At least one reconstructed muon, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>20\), and a \(\mathrm{C/A}\), \(R=1.2\) truth jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>100\) and \(|\eta|<2.0\) are required.
* The leading calorimeter jet reconstructed with each of the five jet collections described in section 2 is within \(0.75\times R\) angular distance of the common leading \(\mathrm{C/A}\), \(R=1.2\) truth jet.

### Data/MC Comparisons

The hadronic \(W\) boson is studied using a sample of enriched \(t\bar{t}\) events. The \(t\bar{t}\) decay mode in which one \(W\) boson decays into a neutrino and a muon is chosen to reduce multi-jet background, thus making the top quark signal clear.

Additionally, the HEPTopTagger algorithm [12, 13] was used in order to select a very pure sample of boosted hadronically-decaying \(W\) bosons in data. The HEPTopTagger was optimised for finding top quarks at relatively low momentum using a very large cone size (\(R=1.5\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>200\).), making it possible to resolve the \(W\) bosons with other higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\), smaller-\(R\) taggers.

For the analyses presented in this note, the default HEPTopTagger parameters as described in Ref. [14] were used. The algorithm proceeds in three main steps:

1. \(\mathrm{C/A}\) jets with \(R=1.5\) are decomposed into "substructure objects" using the iterative mass-drop procedure illustrated in Figure 1(b), until all subjets have a mass less than 50.

2. In order to remove pileup, jets are then filtered using \(R_{sub\,jet}=0.3\), as described in Ref. [2] and illustrated in Figure 1(c). The constituents of the five hardest subjets are then clustered into three "substructure objects" using the C/A algorithm.
3. Finally, all combinations of the three substructure objects are tested for compatibility with hadronic top quark decay. One criterion requires that the invariant mass of one pair of substructure objects is within 15% of the \(W\) mass.

## 5 Groomer Performance

First, a comparison is made between the various jet algorithms after application of grooming alone, without considering any further selection based on substructure information. To make an unbiased comparison of the \(W\) boson identification performance in different jet clustering algorithms and grooming techniques, each calorimeter jet is required to match to the same common truth jet which is reconstructed with the \(\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{A}\), \(R=1.2\) as described in Section 3. The truth jet matching efficiency for \(W\)-jets is 98%. The results of grooming and tagging performance are presented in three \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins [200-350, 350-500, 500-1000] GeV corresponding to this \(\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{A}\), \(R=1.2\) truth jet with \(|\eta|<1.2\).

The \(W\) jet signal MC sample has a considerably harder \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum than the multi-jet background sample, even after each bin in the \(\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{A}\), \(R=1.2\) truth jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) has been normalised to the same area. To have a uniform comparison between the \(W\) jet signal and the multi-jet background, the signal MC is reweighted according to the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution of the \(\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{A}\), \(R=1.2\) jet in the background MC.

The different jet grooming algorithms produce jet mass distributions with varying response and resolution. For jet mass to be used in a physics analysis it must be calibrated to remove spurious effects introduced by the detector and/or pileup conditions. In this note we do not apply calibration to the jet mass or to any other variable under study; we instead reduce the dependence of our conclusions on biases due to non-calibration by defining a dynamic signal mass window for each of the algorithms. We define the mass window as the smallest interval, containing the most probable value (or _mode_) of the \(W\) jet mass distribution, for which the number of jets with mass reconstructed inside the window is 68%.

Figure 2 shows the reconstructed invariant mass distributions for signal and background after grooming, as well as the position of the mass window boundaries in each case. Table 1 presents the values of P, L and U which are rounded to the nearest integer values in GeV, the same definition used for the sliding window. The table also contains the corresponding QCD background efficiency in these windows, \(\epsilon_{QCD}\), defined as the fraction of background jets with mass in the same window.

In physics analyses, jet grooming will be used for two reasons:

1. To increase the separation between signal and background. It is apparent from Figure 2 that the QCD jet mass looks very different depending on the grooming algorithm used. As analyses often want to reject multijet backgrounds, it is interesting to ask the question: how do the grooming

Table 1: The most probable value of the signal mass distribution, \(\mathcal{P}\) is given along with the upper (U) and lower (L) boundaries of the mass window that contains 68% of \(W\) jets for each jet algorithm. The boundaries of the sliding windows are rounded to the closest integer in GeV. The fraction of background jets in the mass window, \(\epsilon_{QCD}\) is given with the binomial statistical uncertainty.

algorithms compare in their ability to give us a multijet mass distribution that peaks at or near zero?
2. To improve the resolution of the signal jet mass peak. It is worth noticing that the best algorithm in terms of the background removal is not necessarily the best algorithm in terms of the mass peak resolution for the signal.

The leading calorimeter jet for each algorithm is matched to the nearest truth jet reconstructed with the same algorithm, to evaluate the mass response of the uncalibrated calorimeter reconstruction procedure. A jet is considered unmatched if there is no truth jet with \(\Delta R<0.75\times R\) from the leading calorimeter jet. The proportion of unmatched jets is about 2% for the W signal.

Figure 3 shows the mass response (the ratio between calorimeter jet mass and jet mass of the corresponding matched truth jet) for signal and background for the various algorithms. Table 2 shows the results of Gaussian fits to these ratios, indicating that the deviation of the mean from unity is at most 6%, giving a measure of the effect of lack of calibration for these algorithms. The standard deviation of this ratio is much larger for background than for signal, additional to in the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin. This difference is understood to originate from the differing calorimeter signals of electroweak and QCD jets, with the latter having more soft contributions. There is a clear \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependence in the width of the mass response distributions, with higher \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) resulting in narrower mass response.

### 11.2 Comparison of the \(\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{A}\) and \(R\)-\(\mathrm{C}/\mathrm{A}\) distributions

Figure 2: Calorimeter jet mass in signal and background reconstructed with five different algorithms. For each algorithm, the jet mass is shown in three \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bins for signal (\(W\) jets) and background (QCD jets). Indicated on each distribution is the mass window containing 68% of the signal jets (please see Table 1 for the mass windows and other details). The distributions are all normalised to unity and then offset from zero such that the distributions for the different \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) ranges are all visible.

Figure 3: The mass response in three \(p_{\rm T}\) bins for the five different jet algorithms. The mass response distributions for both signal (\(W\) jets) and background (QCD jets) are shown. The mean values and widths of these distributions are given in Table 2.

Tagger Performance

In addition to the jet mass, a number of observables can be used to characterise the underlying jet substructure. Some of these observables can provide handles to distinguish jets coming from \(W\) bosons from those produced from light quarks and gluons. The set of variables under study here is shown in Figure 4. Each of the seven variables was studied for the five jet algorithms; for illustrative purposes, this figure only shows the substructure variable applied to grooming algorithms giving the best performance, as shown below. The detailed definitions of efficiency and rejection used in these studies is given in Ref. [50]. In addition, we show the same distributions for anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=1.0\) trimmed jets in Figure 5 and for C/A, \(R=1.2\) BDRS jets in Figure 6. We see that in all algorithms (apart perhaps from the C/A, \(R=1.2\) BDRS case), jet width is not very powerful for signal/background separation, as well as variables used in C/A split-filtering when calculated for anti-\(k_{t}\) jets.

Two possible ways to decide on what constitutes the best combined performance are used in this section:

1. For each substructure variable, identify the jet grooming algorithm that gives the greatest background rejection at a fixed 50% signal efficiency for the grooming + tagging combination. The comparisons of these optimal combinations are shown in Figure 7.
2. For each grooming algorithm, identify the substructure variable that gives the greatest background rejection at a fixed 50% signal efficiency, again for the grooming + tagging combination. The comparisons of these optimal combinations are shown in Figure 8.

These two different approaches can respectively be useful if some variables are preferred because they are better modeled by the simulation, or if an analysis has to use a given jet algorithm because of other properties of the event.

The full evaluation of the tagger performance must take into account two stages:

1. The effect of the substructure tagging variable \(\epsilon^{\mathrm{Tag}}\). The ROC curves are given on the left side of Figure 7 and Figure 8. The taggers can reach a maximal efficiency of 100%.
2. The combined effect of the substructure tagging variable and the groomed jet mass window \(\epsilon^{\mathrm{Groom}}\times\epsilon^{\mathrm{Tag}}\). The ROC curves are shown on the right side of Figure 7 and Figure 8. \(\epsilon^{\mathrm{Groom}}\times\epsilon^{\mathrm{Tag}}\) can have a maximal value of 68%, since this is the efficiency of the sliding window used to select the events after grooming.

These ROC curves indicate which combination is optimal for a given working point and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) range. The result is that for most of the working points, the difference between the best few algorithms is very small, at the level of a few percent. It is possible that, with the full inclusion of systematic uncertainties, the performances of the best algorithms will be equivalent. An understanding of the uncertainties is therefore paramount, as in analyses dealing with huge backgrounds, even a difference in background rejection of a few percent is worth pursuing.

All substructure variables are constructed from the energy and angular separation of jet constituents, and are thus correlated. Figure 9 shows the linear correlation matrices among different taggers for three of the grooming algorithms under study, after applying the mass window requirement. Here the correlation factors between pairs of variables are calculated as their covariance divided by the product of their standard deviations:

\[\rho=\frac{cov(x,y)}{\sigma_{x}\,\sigma_{y}} \tag{9}\]

The correlation matrices of BDRS-A and \(k_{t}\)-pruned jets are similar to BDRS and C/A-pruned jets within 10% variation. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) dependence of the correlation matrix is also within 10% variation. Some selected observations from these matrices can be made:Figure 4: The seven substructure variables in \(W\)**jdt** (signal) and QCD jet (background) distributions are shown. In each case the grooming algorithm shown is that which makes the best groomer+tagger combination in terms of efficiency and rejection, so these plots are not directly comparable in terms of individual variables. The shaded band represents the bin-by-bin statistical uncertainty in simulation.

The shaded band represents the bin-by-bin statistical uncertainty in simulation.

* Width and \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) are highly correlated to jet mass.
* Planar flow is highly correlated to \(\tau_{21}\) and anti-correlated to \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\).
* The mass-drop, \(\mu_{12}\), is highly correlated with planar flow and \(\tau_{21}\) in \(\mathrm{C/A}\) jets but not in anti-\(k_{t}\) jets.
* The Q-jet volatility, \(\nu_{Qjets}\), is weakly anti-correlated with most of the variables, so it could be effectively used in combination with other taggers.
* The correlation of \(\tau_{21}\) to \(\sqrt{y_{f}}\) and \(\mu_{12}\) in \(\mathrm{C/A}\) jets is reduced after pruning.
* The mass-drop, \(\mu_{12}\), is anti-correlated to jet mass, \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\) and width, and is correlated with \(\tau_{12}\) and planar flow in \(W\) jets.
* The correlation is weaker in QCD-jets and even smaller in the \(\mathrm{C/A}\)-pruned jets.
* All substructure variables under study are weakly correlated with the number of reconstructed primary vertices, \(N_{\mathit{vtx}}\), indicating a weak pileup dependence.

Data/MC comparison for some substructure variables

To facilitate the comparison of \(W\)-tagging variables in data and Monte Carlo simulation the HEPTopTagger algorithm [12, 13] is used to selects jets compatible with coming from hadronic decays of the top quark, as described in Section 4.

The five jet definitions studied in the previous section are reduced to two for these studies, as only the C/A, \(R=1.2\) BDRS and anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=1.0\) trimmed jets have a full calibration available. The four momenta of these jets are calibrated in both data and MC for the comparisons shown here.

Figure 10 shows the leading jet mass distributions for the two algorithms under study. The compatibility between data and Monte Carlo is probed using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) [51] test. This test compares the difference between the cumulatives of two distributions, and only accounts for statistical errors. Unlike the \(\chi^{2}\) test, it is able to distinguish systematic deviations (for instance, one distribution consistently above the other) with respect to fluctuations (when one variable shows some bins above and some below the other). The agreement found is quite good for all the plots shown.

Figure 11 shows the comparisons between data and Monte Carlo simulation for some the variables studied here in the context of \(W\)-tagging, and relevant for trimmed jets: the mass drop, the planar flow, the splitting scale \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\), the \(N\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{12}\), the momentum balance \(\sqrt{p_{f}}\) and the Q-jet volatility. All these variables are calculated from the anti-\(k_{t}\), \(R=1.0\) jet collection, after trimming. We see that in all cases a good agreement between data and Monte Carlo is observed.

Figure 12 shows the comparison between variables relevant to C/A, \(R=1.2\) BDRS jets. Variables studied here are the mass drop fraction \(\mu_{12}\), the planar flow, the splitting scale \(\sqrt{d_{12}}\), the \(N\)-subjettiness ratio \(\tau_{12}\), the momentum balance \(\sqrt{p_{f}}\) andthe Q-jet volatility. We observe good agreement between data and Monte Carlo simulation, with Kolmogorov-Smirnov probabilities always larger than 15%. This validates the use of all these variables in \(W\)-tagging.

Conclusions

Boosted \(W\) boson tagging methods have been studied using the ATLAS data recorded in 2012. First, a Monte Carlo study has assessed the performance of different grooming and tagging algorithms to select a sample of signal \(W\) bosons coming from decays of massive particles over a QCD background. This study shows differences in the performance of various jet algorithms and variables used in the tagging when individually looking at the separation of signal and background after grooming, or after tagging. On the other hand, when the combined effect of jet grooming and \(W\)-tagging are considered, various combinations have similar performance, and no approach emerges as being clearly better than the others for all efficiency/rejection working points. The correlation study gives hope that more information could be extracted by the combination of more than one variable.

The second part of this study is dedicated to comparisons with data, using top decays as a high purity source of \(W\)s. The semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) decay mode in which one \(W\) boson decays into a neutrino and a muon is chosen, and jets are required to pass the HEPTopTagger requirements. In general, good agreement between data and Monte Carlo is observed for all the distributions considered. This supports the use of these variables to select \(W\) bosons from data.
