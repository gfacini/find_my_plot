Bicron fibers: choice of the UVA concentration for the Barrel Module 0

_LIP and Univ. Lisbon, Portugal_Introduction

Historically, in 1993, the first fibers used in the prototype modules of the Tilecal calorimeter were Bicron single clad (SC) BCF91A, and in 1994 the fibers used to equip the prototypes were multi clad (MC) Kuraray Y11. Both of these fibers had not UV Absorber (UVA). Tests with the prototypes have shown a large enhancement of the calorimeter response to pions and muons in the crack region between modules. The enhancement was due to the light produced in the fibers (direct response to particles hitting the fibers), and to the strong non-uniformity of the first tiles produced for the Tilecal modules. Those tiles had grooves at the edges for the tile-fiber coupling, and their response was much higher near the ends than in the center.

The fiber producers were asked to add a small amount of UVA to the fibers in order to suppress part of the fiber direct response, and both Bicron and Kuraray produced sets of sample fibers with different UVA concentrations for optimisation purposes. The UVA used by both producers suppressed partially the direct response of the fibers to particles as it was envisaged, but they also cause some degradation in the response to scintillator light. For the Kuraray Y11 fibers the degradation of the response to scintillator light is negligible, but the UVA concentrations required to reduce the direct response of the Bicron BCF99-28 fibers to the same levels of Kuraray Y11 fibers lead to the suppression of a non negligible part of the fiber response to scintillator light. The results were published in previous notes [1][2].

In 1995, Y11(200)MS fibers with 600 ppm of UVA were selected as the best compromise between high light output and small direct response. Adding 600 ppm of UVA to the Y11 fibers resulted in a substantial decrease of the direct response of the fibers, a decrease of about 60%, with negligible loss for the scintillator response. The response of the 1995 prototypes to pions showed a drop of the signal of the order of 5% in the crack region, but the tiles used in 1995 also contributed to this drop. These tiles were the best we have used in terms of attenuation length, and the choice of the UVA concentration did not take into account their improvement of uniformity.

The results with the Y11 fibers with 600 ppm of UVA were used as a "guide-line" for the choice of the UVA concentration of the Bicron fibers to reinstrument the Barrel Module 0 during 1998.

Strategy for the choice of the UVA concentration for the Bicron fibers to be used in the re-instrumentation of the Barrel Module 0 in 1998

Bicron MC fibers were a candidate to be used in the Barrel Module 0 being re-equipped in 1998. For all the samples tested until mid 1997, the light output of the Bicron fibers without UVA was not optimised: the light output at distances of the order of 1.5 m was about 30% below the light output of Y11(200)MS fibers with 600 ppm of UVA produced for the 1995 prototypes. The attenuation length of the Bicron fibers was acceptable, i.e., of the order of 2.8 m. From previous results [2] it was known that for SC BCF99-28 fibers, 60 ppm of UVA would suppress about 10% of the scintillator light, and no data was available for smaller UVA concentrations. Since the response of the modules in the crack region was below the module average, the direct response could increase a little, but we could not allow further scintillator light loss.

In order to study the UVA effect in the low concentration range, fibers with smaller amounts of UVA were ordered to Bicron, but some production and labelling accidents made impossible to use the fibers produced for the intended study. The same happened to the MC fibers ordered for the Barrel Module 0 (the amount of UVA asked was 20 ppm of UVA, a "guess" to get the best light output at expenses of the electron/scintillator response ratio). These last ones, labelled BCF99-28-G MC, showed a small attenuation length (about 2.5 m), resulting in a light output at a distance of 1.7 m about 30% smaller than the one obtained with the Y11 fibers of the 1995 prototypes. At this distance, even SC fibers of the same type showed a slightly higher light output. These fibers could not be used in the instrumentation of the Barrel Module 0 and were rejected.

The problem was discussed with Bicron, and about 6 weeks later Bicron sent us new MC BCF99-28 fibers with 20 ppm of UVA, and these last ones showed an acceptable attenuation length (280-300 cm) and a good light output. Compared to the Y11(200)MS fibers with 600 ppm of UVA produced for the 1995 prototypes, the light output at distances of the order of 1.5 m was only about 5% smaller, and it was about 5% above the light output of the Y11(200)MS fibers used in the Modules 0. But the new Bicron fibers with 20 ppm of UVA showed a direct response to electrons about 3.8 times higher than the Y11 with 600 ppm of UVA. There was no time to produce new samples with different UVA concentrations, so it was necessary to decide the amount of UVA based on the existing data at the time.

## 3 Procedure to combine all the data

The existing data in January 1998 resulted from several sets of measurements of different fibers. A set of MC Y11 fibers with UVA concentrations 0, 30, 100, 300 and 1000 ppm was tested in 1995, at the same time as a set of SC BCF99-28 fibers with UVA concentrations 0, 60, 300, 600, 2500, 10000 and 20000 ppm [2]. The results are shown in tables 2 and 3. In January 1998 the new MC BCF99-28 with 20 ppm of UVA were tested at the same time as the Y11(200)MS with 600 ppm of UVA from the 1997 Extended Barrel Module 0. Since the data is in arbitrary units, a normalisation of the data was required before the analysis could be done. The scintillator is often changed, and the results obtained change from one measurement to the other depending on the quality of the scintillator used, on the scintillator-fiber distance and on the damage caused to the scintillator by the source that is permanently in front of it. The analysis was done using only a typical distance of the fiber excitation point to the PMT. It was chosen a distance of 140 cm as in the Tilecal note 95 [2].

The fiber Y11(200)MS with 600 ppm of UVA was not tested in 1995, but the change of the light output with the UVA concentration is well behaved as can be seen in figures 1 and 2, so the points for the 600 ppm concentration were built by interpolation using the neighbour concentrations of 300 and 1000 ppm. The resulting points are plotted (solid circles) in the same figures.

The points built in the plot for the Y11(200)MS with 600 ppm of UVA can be used now to convert all the values of the note to the arbitrary units of January 1998, with the multiplicative factors obtained from table 1.

Since the BCF99-28 fibers tested in January 98 are MC and the other BCF99-28 are SC, a correction factor has to be applied to the SC fibers to increase their light output to the level of the MC fibers. In order to estimate the correction factor, it was assumed that the BCF99-28 MC fibers with 20 ppm of UVA had no loss for scintillator light when compared with similar fibers without UVA. With this assumption it is possible to set the scale MC/SC (at a distance of 140 cm) for the Bicron fibers. The value shown in the note for fibers without UVA (2.86) multiplied by f\({}_{s}\) gives 0.395, which should correspond to 0.50 obtained for the MC fiber, so the MC/SC factor f\({}_{mc/sc}\) is 0.50/0.395=1.266, i.e., the MC BCF99-28 gives about 27% more light at a distance of 140 cm than the respective SC fiber.

In what concerns the direct response of the fibers, it is assumed that the scale factor MC/SC is the same for scintillator and direct response to

in the optimisation of this parameter. So an increase to 2-2.5 in the electron to scintillator ratio will be tested, being in the middle between the first fibers used by Tilecal (BCF91A without UVA) and the present situation (Y11(200)MS 600 ppm UVA). Such ratio is obtained in the range of 60 ppm of UVA, but a drop of scintillator light of the order of 10% is expected to occur. That means that we expect almost the same light as we have with the Y11 fibers of the Modules 0.

## 5 Final remarks

The Barrel Module 0 in 1998 was instrumented with fibers from Bicron and fibers from Pol.Hi.Tech. The half-module instrumented with Bicron fibers is equipped with MC BCF 99-28 fibers with 60 ppm of UVA in the cells of sampling A, and with MC fibers BCF91A in the samplings BC and D. This distribution results from a problem that Bicron had during the production of the BCF 99-28 fibers with UVA. After the successful production of the fibers of the first preforms with the lengths required for sampling A, they were not able to produce more good fibers from the preforms they had prepared with UVA. The most similar fibers that Bicron was able to produce in time for the instrumentation of the module were the MC BCF91A fibers.
