In this note we investigate the effect of ganging a large number of ESTs in the 0T preamplifier scenario under a set of physically relevant conditions. We present PSPICE simulation results on the current design. Systematic studies show the behaviour in various modified designs. We show the effect on the signal both at pre-amplifier output and sharper output, and provide a basic interpretation for our findings.

## I Introduction

The new generation of high energy physics experiments at LHC present an experimental challenge for the detectors. In hadron calorimetry there arises a need for extremely fast detectors, due to the typical cell capacitances \(C\) of \(O(\mbox{nF})\), and the short bunch crossing time of 25 ns. The ATLAS hadronic end-cap calorimeter (HEC) will meet the fast response challenge by the use of two concepts; first, by the use of an EST [1] and, second, by the use of a fine read-out granularity. This will limit the capacitance of the individual readout cells to values below 200 pF. Together with the use of an characteristic impedance \(R\) of 50 \(\Omega\) for the transmission line, the rise times at the preamplifier level (10% \(-\)90%) are then smaller than 20 ns.

At this point in time, two different pre-amplifier scenarios are being discussed. In the first, 0T, scenario, the pre-amplifiers are outside the cryostat, and eight to sixteen EST structures are ganged together before the pre-amplifier input. In the other, GaAs pre-amplifier, scenario, the pre-amplifiers are inside the cryostat, and only two EST structures are ganged together before the pre-amplifier input. In this note, we investigate the effect of ganging of ESTs in the 0T scenario. A similar investigation has been carried out for the GaAs pre-amplifier case [2].

## II The Simulation

The PSPICE model used describes a typical situation in the rear read-out segment of the HEC calorimeter. In this calorimeter part, sixteen EST structures are ganged together to one read-out tower. The thickness of the copper plates is 50 mm. The thickness of each EST structure is 8 mm. In the 0T scenario, the signal is lead to the pre-amplifiers via co-axial cables with a characteristic impedance of 20 \(\Omega\).

The model of the read-out cell is shown in Fig. 1. We represent each EST structure by a single capacitor. The capacitance value used was 110 pF, which is a typical value for the rear read-out section of the HEC. Sixteen such capacitors were ganged together. Each ganging length was modeled by a 5.85 mm long ideal 50 \(\Omega\) co-axial cable. In the current design, it is realized by a kapton strip-line, thus this is an approximation. We used triangular current sources in parallel to the capacitors to simulate the signal current, and a time difference of 0.195 ns between any two adjacent current sources to account for the time of flight of an actual particle penetrating the detector.

We studied three different "physics" situations:

* CASE 1: Equal signal in each EST structure. This was to approximate the typical situation for a MIP.
* CASE 2: Equal signal in the front four EST structures, zero signal in the other parts of the read-out tower. This was to approximate a typical jet, or catastrophic radiative energy loss of a muon at the start of the read-out tower. Four EST structures correspond to about 16 \(X_{0}\) of absorber material.
* CASE 3: Equal signal in the rear four EST structures, zero signal in the other parts of the read-out tower. This was to approximate a catastrophic radiative energy loss of a muon in the back part of the read-out tower.

We used three values of \(t_{p}(\delta)\), i.e. 15 ns, 30 ns, and 50 ns.

In our systematic studies we varied the EST capacitance (70 pF, 110 pF, 190 pF), the number of ESTs ganged (8, 16), and the ganging cable impedance (50 \(\Omega\), 20 \(\Omega\), 10 \(\Omega\)) for the CASEs 2, 3.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:5]

For each of the above cases, we studied the signal at the pre-amplifier output, and at shaper output. Again, we tried three values of \(t_{p}(\delta)\): 15 ns, 30 ns, and 50 ns.

In Fig 3 and Fig. 4 we show the signal at shaper output as a function of time for the cases 1, 3, 5, and 2, 4, 6 respectively, i.e. for keeping the EST capacitance fixed at 190 pF while varying the residual parameters.

Figures 5 and 7 summarize the values found for the peak signal for all cases with a ganging impedance of 50 \(\Omega\), and 20 \(\Omega\), for ganging 16, and 8 ESTs to one pre-amplifier respectively. Figures 6, and 8 summarize the values found for \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) in the same manner. Figures 9 and 10 compare for all cases the peak signal at the shaper output, and \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) for signal in the front part of the read-out section to the cases with signal in the rear part of the read-out section. Figure 9 shows the relative difference in peak signal at the shaper output, and Fig. 10 shows the differences in \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) for the two scenarios.

We find that both lower ganging cable impedance, and ganging a smaller number of ESTs result in an amelioration of the situation.

At the pre-amplifier output we find that ganging 8 instead of 16 ESTs to one pre-amplifier halves the period of the reflections. Reducing the EST capacitance from 110pF to 70pF reduces the period of the reflections by about 20%. Reducing the ganging cable impedance from 50 \(\Omega\) to 20 \(\Omega\) reduces the repetition time of the reflections by approximately 40%. The behaviour found is very similar to that of a CLC type oscillator with the signal line as a leak.

For ganging 16 ESTs and low shaping time we find oscillations on the signal at the shaper output in all cases for the maximum EST capacitance in the HEC (190 pF). They result in a difference front to back in \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) of about 15 ns, and a relative difference front to back in the peak signal of about 10% for an EST capacitance of 110 pF. For high values (50 ns) of \(t_{p}(\delta),\) the effect on the peak valuesis reduced to less than 2%, but the difference in the timing stays at about 10 ns for the best scenario (10 \(\Omega\) ganging impedance).

For an EST capacitance of 110 pF or 70 pF, the relative difference front to back in the peak signal is smaller than 1% at high values of \(t_{p}(\delta)\), and the difference in \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) then drops below 5 ns.

For ganging 8 ESTs (190 pF) to one pre-amplifier, and using low shaping times (15 ns), we see oscillatory behaviour at the shaper output only for 50 \(\Omega\) ganging impedance. When using 20 \(\Omega\), distortions are still visible close to the peak. At a ganging impedance of 10 \(\Omega\), the signal shape is very satisfactory. For the higher values of \(t_{p}(\delta)\) studied, no distortions are visible at the shaper output.

The effect on the peak signal at shaper output is moderate. For a ganging impedance of 50 \(\Omega\) and 20 \(\Omega\), the maximum relative difference front to back is about 5%. For a ganging impedance of 10 \(\Omega\), it is smaller than about 3% in all cases. The maximum timing difference found was smaller than 15 ns for a ganging impedance of 50 \(\Omega\), and smaller than 9 ns for a ganging impedance of 20 \(\Omega\). For a ganging impedance of 10 \(\Omega\), the relative timing is better than 2 ns.

For the higher two values of \(t_{p}(\delta)\), the differences in peak signal (front to back) are smaller than 4% in all cases. The maximum timing difference amounts to 10 ns for a ganging impedance of 50 \(\Omega\), to 4 ns for 20 \(\Omega\), and to 1 ns for 10 \(\Omega\).

For the lower values of capacitance, the relative difference front to back in the peak signal is less than 3.5% in all cases. The differences in \(t_{p}(\Delta)\) are sizeable for a ganging impedance of 50 \(\Omega\) (7 ns). For the other cases, the relative timing front to back is better than 4 ns.

## V Conclusions

In summary, we find for the current design of the HEC strong oscillations on the shaper output signal when using 0T preamplifiers and ganging 16 EST structures to one pre-amplifier.

When ganging 16 ESTs to a pre-amplifier, but reducing the impedance value of the cable used for interconnection of the individual ESTs, we still find oscillations on the shaper output signal in the range of capacitances present in the HEC and the values of \(t_{p}(\delta)\) of interest.

Reducing the number of ESTs ganged to one pre-amplifier strongly improves the situation.

When ganging eight ESTs to one pre-amplifier, the use of low shaping times results only in distortions of the signal at shaper output in the cases studied, except for a ganging impedance of 10 \(\Omega\), where no effect is visible. Still, for a ganging impedance of 50 \(\Omega\), and 20 \(\Omega\), low values of \(t_{p}(\delta)\) are ruled out by the resulting difference in relative timing for delta-rays in the front part relative to delta-rays in the back part of a read-out cell.

When using 10 \(\Omega\) lines for interconnection within a read-out cell, and ganging eight ESTs to one pre-amplifier, our simulation shows a difference in peak signal (front to back) of 3% or less. The relative timing is found to be always better than 3.5 ns. This is very close to our requirements.

In the case the 0T scenario is adopted, we recommend to combine low ganging impedance with ganging a small number of ESTs, and to investigate the possibility of ganging a number of ESTs smaller than eight.

Figure 1: Model of a read-out tower. Each EST structure is represented by a single capacitor. Sixteen cells are ganged to one tower. The ganging length (58.5 mm) is realized through ideal co-axial cables. A triangular current source in parallel to each capacitance simulates the signal. A time delay between any two adjacent current sources (bottom to top, 0.195 ns each) models the time structure of particle propagation in the detector.
