# Expected pile-up values at the HL-LHC

The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations

###### Abstract

In this brief note the expected mean number of interactions and the length of the luminous region for the HL-LHC is discussed for an instantaneous luminosity of 5\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). Its dependence on various parameters is discusssed and an uncertainty is estimated. It is found that the mean pile-up is about 130, and more than 10% of all bunch crossings will have a pile-up of at least 140. The length of the luminous region is anticipated to be about 5 cm.

Introduction

For a given collider luminosity, \(\cal L\), the mean number of interactions per crossing (called "pile-up"), \(\mu\), is given by

\[\mu=\frac{\sigma_{\rm inel}{\cal L}}{n_{b}f_{r}} \tag{1}\]

where \(n_{b}\) is the number of colliding bunches, \(f_{r}\) is the revolution frequency, and \(\sigma_{\rm inel}\) is the inelastic cross section. At the LHC, \(f_{r}\) has the fixed value of 11,245 Hz and the design value for the maximum number of colliding bunches is 2,808. The distance between colliding bunches is 25 ns. The design value of the peak luminosity1 for the HL-LHC [1] is \(5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). This value is maintained by luminosity leveling after the start of each fill, i.e. the luminosity is kept constant for an extended time despite the beam currents decreasing with time. The techniques to achieve this are either to adjust the beam separation, the transverse size of the beam at the interaction point along the nominal beam trajectory (\(\beta^{*}\)), or the crossing angle compensation provided by the crab cavities. While beam separation was used for LHCb during run-1 for leveling the luminosity, \(\beta^{*}\) leveling is considered to be the most likely scheme for the future.

Footnote 1: The peak luminosity is the maximum value of the bunch-averaged instantaneous luminosity during a fill. The luminosity of individual bunch pairs can be lower or higher.

In this note the inelastic cross section and the LHC machine parameters are discussed and conclusions are drawn on the expected range of \(\mu\) values and the length of the luminous region.

## 2 Inelastic cross section

The inelastic \(pp\) cross section at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV has been measured by the ALICE [2], ATLAS [3], CMS [4] and TOTEM [5] collaborations. The ATLAS measurement is \(\sigma_{\rm inel}(7\ {\rm TeV})=69.4\pm 2.4\ ({\rm exp})\pm 6.9\ ({\rm extr})\) mb where the first uncertainty is due to experimental uncertainties and the second uncertainty is due to uncertainties in the extrapolation from the visible part of the cross section to the full inelastic cross section. The corresponding value for CMS is \(68.0\pm 3.1\ ({\rm exp})\pm 4.0\ ({\rm extr})\) mb. ALICE has measured this cross section as \(73.2^{+2.0}_{-4.6}\ ({\rm model})\pm 2.6\ ({\rm lumi})\) mb. The measurement of the TOTEM collaboration is based on a very different technique and does not suffer from the large extrapolation uncertainty and therefore has a much better precision, yielding a cross section of \(72.9\pm 1.5\) mb. All four measurements agree with each other and are shown in Fig. 1 together with the measurements at lower \(\sqrt{s}\) from the past few decades [5]. Since the measurement by the TOTEM collaboration is most precise this will be used for the further discussion in this note.

The cross section rises slowly with increasing energy and a large number of predictions for this rise have been made. These predictions are uncertain as the scale of the process is too low for perturbative QCD to be applicable. A range of predictions is shown in Table 1 for both \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV based on models of Schuler and Sjostrand [6] (implemented in Pythia), Block and Halzen [7], and two models by Achilli _et al._[8]. In Pythia the inelastic process is separated into non-diffractive (ND), single-diffractive (SD) and double-diffractive (DD) processes and the individual values for each of these processes are also given. The SD and DD processes have a lower particle multiplicity and thus contribute less to the activity in the tracking detectors than the non-diffractive events.

The ratio of the 14 TeV and 7 TeV inelastic cross sections in these models varies between 1.08 and 1.13. Based on this we take a value of \(1.11\pm 0.03\) as the central value for the ratio.

Assuming this value and the TOTEM measurement of the cross section at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV, the inelastic cross section at 14 TeV is expected to be \(80.9\pm 1.7\ ({\rm TOTEM\ meas.})\pm 2.2\ ({\rm extr.\ to\ 14\ TeV})\) mb, which we round to \(\sigma_{\rm inel}(14\ {\rm TeV})=81\pm 3\) mb.

LHC bunch structure

The nominal number of bunches in the LHC is 2808 and we assume that these will be fully used for HL-LHC. During Run-1 only 1380 bunches were filled since the bunch spacing was 50 ns.

During the 2012 LHC run, the relative spread in the luminosity values between the individual bunch crossings was \(\pm 8\%\) for the 50 ns running (see Fig. 2). Despite higher bunch intensities and additional bunch splitting operations in the injectors, it is expected that a similar spread can be maintained at the HL-LHC. Two tests performed in 2012, one with high luminosity bunches, the other with a 25 ns structure, support this assumption [9].

## 4 Expected pile-up at HL-LHC

For a fixed luminosity of \(5.0\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), \(n_{b}=2808\) and a cross section of \(81\pm 3\) mb, the resulting pile-up is calculated as \(128\pm 5\) following Eq. 1. As discussed in Sec. 3, one third of the bunch crossings will deviate from the average luminosity by more than \(\pm 8\%\). This implies that about 12% of the bunch crossings have \(\mu>140\).

Additional effects may cause a larger spread in the luminosity per bunch crossing, e.g. the luminosity-levelling procedure may introduce time variations. No detailed information is available about this, and thus this effect is assumed to be small compared to the 8% luminosity variations for individual bunch crossings for the purpose of this note.

Figure 2: The RMS of the relative difference between the luminosity per bunch crossing and the luminosity averaged over all bunch crossings in a short time interval for all LHC fills taken with 50 ns bunch spacing in 2012. The typical length of a time interval is 20 s. The plot is made using the CMS luminosity measurements from 2012.

Size of luminous region

Another important parameter is the length of the luminous region, as it determines the density of pile-up interactions. The higher the density of pile-up vertices the more challenging it is to reconstruct them individually; more and more individual interactions may be merged into a single vertex. The relevant HL-LHC parameters that determine the size of the luminous region are \(\beta^{*}=0.15\) m, the emittance \(\epsilon=2.5\)\(\mu\)m and the crossing angle \(\alpha=590\)\(\mu\)rad (which is fully compensated by the crab cavities). Here we assume that \(\beta^{*}\) luminosity leveling is used2 and that the density of protons in a bunch follows a Gaussian distribution. With these assumptions, the above parameters yield a transverse beam size of \(\sigma_{x}=\sigma_{y}=7\)\(\mu\)m and a longitudinal size of \(\sigma_{z}=5\) cm.

Footnote 2: Crab-cavity based luminosity leveling would yield a beamspot with \(\sigma_{z}\) increasing from 1 cm to 7.5 cm during a fill. This leveling strategy is disfavoured by the experiments for this reason.

More complex scenarios have been studied recently including possible non-Gaussian shapes, but yielding a rather similar length [10].

## 6 Conclusions

We have revisited the expected pile-up for the HL-LHC considering uncertainties in the inelastic cross section, the number of colliding bunches and the spread in the luminosity per bunch crossing. The pile-up is expected to be about 130 events per crossing for a luminosity of \(5.0\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV but due to the expected 8% dispersion on the luminosity per bunch crossing more than 10% of all bunch crossings are expected have a pile-up of \(>140\).

For HL-LHC related upgrade studies both ATLAS and CMS will adopt 140 pile-up interactions as default and use a Gaussian beamspot profile with a length of \(\sigma_{z}=5\) cm.
