###### Abstract

This note summarizes the impact on ATLAS top-quark physics of a run extension of the LHC until the end of 2012, as opposed to the end of 2011. The note is based on previously published estimates of the sensitivity and precision of top measurements with the ATLAS detector. The perspectives for top-antitop and single-top cross-section measurements, top mass and top properties are extrapolated to an integrated luminosity of 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the extended run and 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the planned 2011 run.

Introduction

A possible extension of the LHC proton-proton run until 2012 is discussed in the light of measurements in the top sector. The impact of an increase of the integrated luminosity from \(\int\mathcal{L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) expected in 2011 to about 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) is estimated for several measurements including the top-quark production cross-sections and the top-quark's properties. A center-of-mass energy of 7 TeV is assumed. The gain from an increase by 1 TeV is estimated to be small in this context, except for searches for \(t\bar{t}\) resonances and single-top cross-section measurements.

The assumptions under which the estimates are calculated are listed in section 2. In section 3 the uncertainty on measurements of the single-top and top-antitop pair production cross-section are summarized. The impact on the measurement of the top-quark's properties are discussed in section 4. Conclusions are drawn in section 5.

## 2 Assumptions

### Signal statistics

The center-of-mass energy is assumed to be 7 TeV. The cross-sections estimated at near-NNLO for top-antitop production [1, 2] and NLO for single-top processes [3] are summarized in Table 1.

The top mass in these calculations is assumed to be 172.5 GeV. The acceptance times branching ratio for \(t\bar{t}\) pairs, using an event selection as in [4], as well as the fraction of signal events and the number of expected \(t\bar{t}\) events for \(\int\mathcal{L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) and \(\int\mathcal{L}=5\) fb\({}^{-1}\) are summarized in Table 2.

Expected acceptances and yields for the \(t\)-channel, \(Wt\)-channel and \(s\)-channel single-top processes are shown in Table 3. These estimates are extrapolated from previously published studies to 7 TeV center-of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r} \hline Process & Cross-section (pb) \\ \hline top-antitop pair & 164.6 \\ single-top \(t\)-channel & 66.2 \\ single-top \(Wt\)-channel & 14.6 \\ single-top \(s\)-channel & 4.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline Channel & \(\mathcal{A}\times\) BR & \(N_{\mathrm{\bar{t}}}(\int\mathcal{L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1})\) & \(N_{\mathrm{\bar{t}}}(\int\mathcal{L}=5\) fb\({}^{-1})\) & \(S/B\) \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\to\)\(e\)+\(jets\) & 3.10\% & 5.1k & 25.5k & 2.0 \\ \(t\bar{t}\to\)\(\mu\)+\(\mathrm{jets}\) & 3.20\% & 5.3k & 26.3k & 4.6 \\ \(t\bar{t}\to\)\(ee\) & 0.24\% & 0.4k & 2.0k & 1.9 \\ \(t\bar{t}\to\)\(\mu\mu\) & 0.38\% & 0.6k & 3.1k & 2.0 \\ \(t\bar{t}\to\)\(e\mu\) & 0.81\% & 1.3k & 6.6k & 4.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The acceptances times branching ratios are taken from [4], and the cross-sections are taken from [1].

mass collisions. For each process two approaches are considered: event selections obtained from a simple cut-based analysis (CB) and using a multivariate technique (MVA). Cut-based estimates are extrapolated from [5] for the \(t\)-channel and from [6] for the \(Wt\)- and \(s\)-channels. Multivariate estimates for the \(t\)- and \(Wt\)-channels employ boosted decision trees documented in [6], and [7] for the \(Wt\)- (dilepton) channel. The di-lepton and lepton+jets results are combined for the \(Wt\)-channel. For the \(s\)-channel a likelihood multivariate discriminant is used [6].

### Systematic uncertainties

The prediction of systematic uncertainties at higher integrated luminosities can only be approximate. The tendency that some sources of uncertainty are better understood with more data is taken into account by studying two different scenarios. In the _conservative_ estimate, the systematic uncertainties from [4] are assumed. These uncertainties will be used for the estimate of the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario. For detector effects, such as the jet energy scale, QCD estimates and b-tagging efficiencies, an _improved_ estimate assumes that all such uncertainties are half as large for the 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) scenario. Other uncertainties, e.g. initial and final state radiation or signal modelling, are assumed to be unchanged.

## 3 Impact on top cross-section measurements

### Top-antitop pair production

Inclusive top-antitop cross-section measurements will be fully dominated by systematics with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. In principle large data samples would allow dominant systematic effects like \(b\)-tagging efficiency, ISR/FSR and (\(b\)-)jet energy scale, to be constrained directly from \(t\bar{t}\) events. However the uncertainty on these systematic effects will also be systematically dominated. So even if more data could mean smaller systematics, the improvement would be limited. On the other hand measurements such as \(t\bar{t}\) differential cross-sections would benefit from increased statistics.

Moving to 8 TeV collisions would allow for a new cross-section measurement. The \(t\bar{t}\) cross-section is expected to increase by about 40%. However, since the background rates also increase, the gain in signal-over-background is expected to be modest.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline Channel & \(\mathcal{A}\times\) BR & \(N_{\mathrm{t}}(\int\mathcal{L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1})\) & \(N_{\mathrm{t}}(\int\mathcal{L}=5\) fb\({}^{-1})\) & \(S/B\) \\ \hline \(t\)-ch (CB) & 0.47\% & 310 & 1550 & 0.67 \\ \(t\)-ch (MVA) & 0.22\% & 150 & 750 & 1.13 \\ \hline \(Wt\)-ch (CB) & 1.32\% & 190 & 950 & 0.08 \\ \(Wt\)-ch (MVA) & 0.33\% & 50 & 250 & 0.30 \\ \hline \(s\)-ch (CB) & 0.23\% & 10 & 50 & 0.05 \\ \(s\)-ch (MVA) & 0.13\% & 6 & 30 & 0.10 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Acceptance times branching ratio (\(\mathcal{A}\times\) BR), number of expected single-top events for integrated luminosities of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) and expected signal over background ratio (\(S/B\)) for all three single-top processes. For each channel both cut-based (CB) and multivariate (MVA) event selections are considered [5, 6, 7]. An improved \(S/B\) can be achieved for all channels using MVA techniques that exploit the separation power of several discriminant variables.

### Single-top production

Extrapolated uncertainties on single-top \(t\)-channel and \(Wt\)-channel cross-section measurements are summarized in Table 4 for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) with, respectively, _conservative_ and _improved_ estimates of the systematic uncertainties. Results for both cut-based and multivariate analyses are shown.

For the \(t\)-channel single-top process we can expect to measure 150-300 signal events, depending on the analysis method, with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The cross-section measurement would be systematically limited and a significance of about 3\(\sigma\) could be reached under the _conservative_ scenario. However with better controlled systematic uncertainties a 5\(\sigma\) measurement could be at hand. In the _improved_ systematics scenario and with 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) of collected data a signal significance of 6-7\(\sigma\) could even be reached. With appropriate multivariate tools the \(t\)-channel cross-section measurement could be as precise as \(\sim 13\%\) and this would result in an uncertainty on the CKM matrix element \(|V_{tb}|\) of about 7%.

For the \(Wt\)-channel the gain from more available statistics could be even greater. The sensitivity in this channel is largely dominated by systematic effects with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. A sophisticated multivariate analysis could isolate about 50 signal events with a purity of about 20%, and the uncertainty on the cross-section measurement would be limited to about 70%, using the _conservative_ approach. On the other hand with 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) a few hundred \(Wt\) signal events and reduced systematic uncertainties are expected, so a 3\(\sigma\) signal significance could be reached. One could further extrapolate that with an additional year to develop, tune and combine several multivariate analyses a better result may be achieved.

From the physics point of view, observing the \(Wt\) channel is of great interest, in particular for the search for a light charged Higgs boson. This channel is out of reach at the Tevatron, and the LHC has a unique opportunity to measure it. Also combining \(t\) and \(Wt\) cross-section measurements results allows a test of the Standard Model and probes several new physics scenarios. A \(t\)-channel vs \(Wt\)-channel cross-section measurement with 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) would be of significant interest as it could shed light on anomalous couplings, 4\({}^{th}\) generation quarks, flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC), charged Higgs boson, etc, with less uncertainty than at the Tevatron.

An \(s\)-channel measurement will prove to be difficult since, with 10 expected events after analysis selection for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and a poor \(S/B\) ratio (5-10%), the statistical cross-section uncertainty is already above 100%. Even for 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) the measurement would be quite limited by both statistics and systematic uncertainties. However this measurement would still be interesting to perform to derive cross-section limits.

Moving to collisions at 8 TeV center-of-mass energy will increase the single-top cross-section by 20, 30 and 40% for \(s\)-, \(t\)- and \(Wt\)-channels respectively. Globally a better S/B ratio is expected which will help reduce most of the systematic uncertainties. This scenario would benefit single-top analyses and would allow the previous results to be achieved more quickly.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l} \hline Process & \(\int\mathcal{L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) & \(\int\mathcal{L}=5\) fb\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \(t\)-ch (CB) & 38\% (9\%) & 17\% (4.2\%) \\ \(t\)-ch (MVA) & 32\% (10\%) & 13\% (4.8\%) \\ \hline \(Wt\) (CB) & 100\% (25\%) & 52\% (11\%) \\ \(Wt\) (MVA) & 68\% (30\%) & 32\% (13\%) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Total uncertainty includes statistical and systematic errors. Numbers enclosed in brackets are statistical errors only.

Impact on top properties measurements

### Top-quark mass

As shown in the studies in [8] for \(\sqrt{s}=10\) TeV, the measurement of the top-quark mass will be limited by systematic uncertainties for an integrated luminosity well below 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). The statistical uncertainty is extrapolated to be less than 0.6 GeV for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). The most significant sources of systematic uncertainties are the jet energy scale as well as initial and final state radiation. The total uncertainty is roughly 2 GeV (depending on simplified assumptions about the systematic uncertainties). Further calculations comparing the total uncertainty for data sets with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) and 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) have not been performed here.

Advanced techniques, e.g., using the \(p_{T}\) of the lepton, using track jets or using a partial reconstruction of the final state involving \(J/\psi\) are being studied at the moment. Estimators built in such analyses are statistically limited, but have the advantage of depending only marginally on the jet energy scale. An increase in integrated luminosity will thus lead to a significant improvement of the measurement.

### Top charge

Similar to studies of top mass measurements, studies in [6] indicate that an exotic top charge of -4/3 \(e\) can be excluded by more than 5\(\sigma\) with a data set of roughly 0.1 fb\({}^{-1}\). A gain from 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) is not expected. Thus, no further expectation is calculated in this note.

### W helicity

In [6], an analysis with 3500 selected signal events in each of the e+jets and \(\mu\)+jets channels is presented assuming an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). The analysis was performed assuming \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and a signal fraction of 89%. Using the much higher selection efficiency and lower S/B ratio (compared to [6]) estimated in Table 2, this analysis corresponds to an analysis performed with \(\int\mathcal{L}=0.7\) fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The estimated statistical and systematic uncertainties are summarized in Table 5. The systematic uncertainties are directly taken from [6] (Table 10, p. 1018). The dominant uncertainties are the hadronization scheme and the mass of the top-quark, followed by initial and final state radiation. Since these do not depend on the amount of data collected the systematic uncertainties are assumed to be the same for both luminosity scenarios.

In conclusion, the measurement of the W helicity would benefit from an increased luminosity.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \hline Quantity & Stat. (\(\int\mathcal{L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) & Stat. (\(\int\mathcal{L}=5\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) & Syst. \\ \hline _e+jets channel:_ & & & \\ \(f_{L}\) & 0.03 & 0.01 & 0.03 \\ \(f_{0}\) & 0.06 & 0.03 & 0.02 \\ \(f_{R}\) & 0.03 & 0.01 & 0.02 \\ \(\mu\)+_jets channel:_ & & & \\ \(f_{L}\) & 0.03 & 0.01 & 0.03 \\ \(f_{0}\) & 0.05 & 0.02 & 0.02 \\ \(f_{R}\) & 0.03 & 0.01 & 0.02 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Statistical and systematic uncertainties on the different W helicity fractions for different luminosities scaled to \(\sqrt{7}=7\) TeV.

### \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlations

A similar analysis is performed in [6] for measurements of the spin correlation between the top- and antitop-quarks. The uncertainties on the estimators \(A\) and \(A_{D}\) are summarized in Table 6. The statistical uncertainties are scaled whereas the systematic uncertainties are kept constant. They are dominated by PDFs, the factorization and b-fragmentation and as such do not change with an increased amount of data.

Studies in the di-leptonic channel indicate that a measurement of \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlations is dominated by systematic uncertainties for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\). However, an increase in integrated luminosity is expected to reduce both the statistical and systematic uncertainties.

The measurement of spin correlations would thus benefit from an increased luminosity.

### \(t\bar{t}\) resonances

Several exotic models in which resonances in the invariant \(t\bar{t}\) mass spectrum are predicted were studied in [9]. The 95% C.L. limit on the cross-section times branching ratio for a resonance mass of 1 TeV is expected to be 3 pb at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV. The inclusion of systematic uncertainties into the limit setting procedures changes the limit only by a small amount. With an increased data set of 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) the limit is expected to be 3 pb\(/\sqrt{5}=1.3\) pb for this particular resonance.

### Flavour changing neutral currents

Searches for FCNC were studied in [6]. The expected branching ratio limits in the three search channels at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), are better than the current Tevatron limits. The systematic uncertainties are expected to vary the limit by a factor of 2. In a simplified model in which the signal and background cross-sections reduce by a factor of 5 for 7 TeV, the limits will be unchanged for 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) compared to the numbers for 14 TeV and 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) (if a discovery is not made). The limits can be found in Table 7.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \hline Quantity & Stat. (\(\int\mathcal{L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) & (\(\int\mathcal{L}=5\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) & Syst. \\ \hline _e+jets channel:_ & & & \\ \(A\) & 0.27 & 0.12 & 0.18 \\ \(A_{D}\) & 0.17 & 0.08 & 0.09 \\ \(\mu\)_+jets channel:_ & & & \\ \(A\) & 0.22 & 0.10 & 0.18 \\ \(A_{D}\) & 0.14 & 0.06 & 0.09 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

\end{table}

### Other properties

Other top-quark properties are expected to be measurable only with an increased data set. Since no previous ATLAS studies are available, no quantitative statement can be made here. Measurements performed or planned at the Tevatron suggest these trends. These properties include tests of CPT by comparing the top- and antitop-quark mass [10, 11], the direct measurement of the CKM matrix element \(V_{ts}\)[12], the measurement of the cross-section for \(t\bar{t}\) production with the additional production of a photon which can be used to measure the electromagnetic coupling of the top-quark [13], and the measurement of the fraction of \(q\bar{q}\)- vs \(gg\)-production [14].

A recent measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry, \(A_{FB}\), in \(t\bar{t}\) events by the CDF collaboration [15] suggests that the asymmetry is 3.4 standard deviations larger than predicted by NLO calculations at large values of the invariant \(t\bar{t}\) mass. Although \(A_{FB}\) at the LHC is not sensitive to such an effect, related observables can be constructed which show a somewhat reduced sensitivity [16]. These include hard cuts on the momentum of the top-quarks and the invariant \(t\bar{t}\) mass. Thus, measurements of these observables are only feasible for an increased integrated luminosity. The investigated scenarios in [16] are 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) for \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV and \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV.

## 5 Conclusions

Single-top cross-section measurements would generally benefit from acquiring 5 fb\({}^{-1}\). This larger data sample would ensure the observation of the dominant \(t\)-channel single-top process and would be useful to assess, for the first time, the presence of the \(Wt\) single-top mechanism. Additional data statistics will also help the very challenging search for the \(s\)-channel process.

While some measurements of the top-quark's properties are limited by systematic uncertainties for low luminosities, e.g., the top mass and the top charge, other properties, such as spin correlations, the W-helicity and the search for resonances, can gain from an extension of the 2011 run. Further properties, e.g., \(V_{ts}\) or the cross-section for \(t\bar{t}\)+photon production cross-section, might only be measurable with an increased data set.

We thus conclude that the majority of measurements in the top sector would significantly benefit from an extension of the LHC 2011 run.
