The possibility of using the decay \(\mbox{B}^{**+}\rightarrow\mbox{B}^{0(*)}\pi^{+}\) and correlations in the \(\mbox{B}^{0}\pi\) system for CP-violation measurements in the ATLAS experiment has been investigated. The statistical error in the CKM unitarity triangle parameter \(\sin 2\beta\) is evaluated and found to be \(0.030\pm 0.003\) for one year of LHC low-luminosity running.

## 1 Introduction

The decay \(\mbox{B}^{0}\),\(\mbox{B}^{0}\rightarrow\mbox{J}/\psi\)\(\mbox{K}^{0}_{\mbox{\tiny S}}\) is sensitive to the angle \(\beta\) in the CKM unitarity triangle[1]. In order to measure this, one has to tag the B-meson at production as either a \(\mbox{B}^{0}\) or a \(\mbox{B}^{0}\). This has so far been studied in ATLAS through the use of a 'lepton tag', in which the flavour of the produced \(\mbox{B}^{0}\) is tagged by the charge of the lepton produced in the semileptonic decay of the other \(b\) quark in the event [2]. The statistics of this method is limited by the low branching ratio of the semileptonic B decay (\(\approx 10\%\)). In order to overcome this limitation, other tagging methods have been proposed.

### Measuring CP violation

Ifone assumes a production asymmetry, due to the non-flavour-symmetric proton-proton initial state, much less than one (expected to be around a few percent), an approximate formula for the error on \(\sin 2\beta\) is [3]:

\[\delta\mbox{sin}\ \,2\beta\approx\left[D_{tag}D_{int}\sqrt{D_{back}\,N_{s}} \right]^{-1}=\left[D_{int}\sqrt{D_{back}\,Q\,N_{rec}}\right]^{-1}\]

where \(D_{tag}\) is a dilution factor coming from the inefficiencies in the tagging method and \(D_{int}\) is a dilution factor coming from the fact that a time-integrated measurement is being made. \(D_{back}=N_{S}/(N_{S}+N_{B})\) is the background dilution factor coming from the presence of background in our B\({}^{0}\) sample where \(N_{S}\) and \(N_{B}\) are the number of signal and background events, respectively. \(N_{S}=\epsilon N_{rec}\), where \(\epsilon\) is the tagging efficiency and \(N_{rec}\) is the number of reconstructed \(\mathrm{B^{0}}\rightarrow\mathrm{J}/\psi\)\(\mathrm{K^{0}_{S}}\) decays. For the \(\mathrm{B^{0}}\rightarrow\mathrm{J}/\psi\)\(\mathrm{K^{0}_{S}}\) decay the background dilution factor is assumed to be around \(\sqrt{D_{back}}=0.98\) as shown in the lepton tag study, but this has to be verified[2]. The factor \(D_{int}\) depends on at which time the measurement is started, ie on the required minimum lifetime of the \(\mathrm{B^{0}}[4]\). For a required proper-lifetime of 0.5 ps for the B\({}^{0}\) which was used in this study, and taking the mass difference of the B\({}^{0}\) mass eigenstates and the average width of the eigenstates from the 1994 PDG values, one obtains \(D_{int}=0.62\)[5].

It is also possible to introduce the simpler measure \(Q\), the _tagging quality factor_, which is independent of the expected number of events and the background:

\[Q=\epsilon\,D_{tag}^{2}=\epsilon(1-2\omega)^{2}\]

where \(\omega\) is the fraction of wrong tags. The quality factor will be used throughout this report.

### The B\({}^{**}\)

Recently, orbitally excited B meson states (B\({}^{**}\)) have been studied at several experiments at LEP and, together with general phase-space correlations between the B and a pion, the use of these states has been proposed as an independent method of \(\mathrm{B^{0}}\)-\(\mathrm{\bar{B}^{0}}\) tagging[6, 7, 8].

B\({}^{**}\) is a common label for orbitally excited states of the B mesons with \(L=1\), see Table 1. From Heavy Quark Effective Theory these are expected to consist of two fairly broad states at \(\approx 5.63\)\(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\) (very rough estimate) and two narrow states at \(\approx 5.75\)\(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\)[9]. The charged B\({}^{**}\) decay to B\({}^{0}\) or B\({}^{0*}\) mainly through the emission of a single charged pion, where the charge of the pion is a signature of the charge of the \(b\) quark, ie

\[\mathrm{B^{**+}} \rightarrow \mathrm{B^{0}}{}^{(*)}\;\pi^{+}\] \[\mathrm{B^{**-}} \rightarrow \mathrm{\bar{B}^{0}}{}^{(*)}\;\pi^{-}\]

where \(\mathrm{B^{0}}{}^{(*)}\) denotes any of B\({}^{0}\) and B\({}^{0*}\). It is the charge of this emitted pion which is used for tagging.

The B\({}^{0*}\) decays radiatively to B\({}^{0}\) through the emission of a photon of \(\approx 46\) MeV. Even after a boost, this will have too low energy to be detected in ATLAS and thus B\({}^{0}\) and B\({}^{0*}\) cannot be distinguished. This leads to the appearance of displaced or doubled peaks in the B\({}^{**}\) mass spectrum, but they are not broadened appreciably[10]. The B\({}^{**}\) mass spectrum of the simulated sample, consisting of 285 B\({}^{**}\), is shown in Figure 1.

### Non-resonant B\(\pi\) correlations

Even without the resonant structure B\({}^{**}\), there is a correlation between the charge of pions nearby in phase space and the flavour of the B[10]. The presence of a \(d\) quark in B\({}^{0}\) implies the production of a \(\bar{d}\) nearby in phase space. If one assumes production of \(u\bar{u}\) and \(d\bar{d}\) quark pairs only, this will give rise to a \(\bar{d}u\) (\(\pi^{+}\)) or a \(\bar{d}d\) (\(\pi^{0}\)) pair. The production of a \(\pi^{0}\) will thus again imply production of a \(\bar{d}u\) (\(\pi^{+}\)) or a \(\bar{d}d\) (\(\pi^{0}\)) pair, and so on further down the fragmentation chain. Thus, the charged particle produced closest to the B\({}^{0}\) will be a \(\pi^{+}\). Strange-quark production and baryon production will alter this simple picture, but these are suppressed compared to the \(ud\) quark production.

The strange quarks are disturbing because they break the isospin symmetry of the tagging method. This leads to different processes occuring for the tagging of neutral and for charged B mesons. Indeed, the ALEPH collaboration has reported a difference in the fraction of wrong tags for charged and neutral B's, respectively. Thus, one will no longer be able to use the reaction \(\mathrm{B^{+}}\to\mathrm{J}\!/\!\psi\)\(\mathrm{K^{+}}\) to measure the wrong-tag fraction directly, as was planned for the lepton tag. Using the channel \(\mathrm{B^{0}}\to\mathrm{J}\!/\!\psi\)\(\mathrm{K^{0}}\) will still be possible.

### B\({}^{**}\)-tagging at LEP

The two types of \(\mathrm{B}\pi\) correlations have been used successfully for B tagging by the ALEPH collaboration at LEP [6]. Here the results, for the fully reconstructed neutral B decays, are a tagging efficiency of \(\epsilon=0.82\pm 0.04\) and a wrong-tag fraction of \(\omega=0.33\pm 0.06\), giving a quality factor \(Q=0.095\pm 0.067\).

### Related tagging methods

Jet- charge tagging, a related tagging method which does not rely on identifying a single pion but looks at the total charge of either the \(\mathrm{B^{0}}\) jet or both \(\mathrm{B}\) jets, has also been studied for use in ATLAS[12]. This method gives a statistical error on sin \(2\beta\) of about \(\pm 0.07\) but it is probably correlated to the \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\) tagging method, and it may not be possible to combine these two measurements. The correlation has, however, not been studied.

## 2 The simulated data samples

A sample of 2000 Monte-Carlo-simulated events has been used for the study1. The PYTHIA 5.7 program was used to generate proton-proton collisions at 14 TeV [13]. The production probability of orbitally excited mesons (ie \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\)), which normally is not enabled in PYTHIA, and the mass values and widths of the \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\), were taken from the ALEPH

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Label & \(j_{q}=L+S_{q}\) & \(J^{P}\) & Mass & Width & Decays to \\ \hline \(\mathrm{B}_{1}^{+}\) & 3/2 & \(1^{+}\) & 5.742 & 0.021 & \(\mathrm{B^{0}}^{*}\) \\ \(\mathrm{B}_{2}^{*+}\) & 3/2 & \(2^{+}\) & 5.754 & 0.025 & \(\mathrm{B^{0}}^{*}\),\(\mathrm{B^{0*}}\) \\ \hline \(\mathrm{B}_{0}^{*+}\) & 1/2 & \(0^{+}\) & 5.630 & 0.10 & \(\mathrm{B^{0}}^{*}\) \\ \(\mathrm{B}_{1}^{*+}\) & 1/2 & \(1^{+}\) & 5.642 & 0.10 & \(\mathrm{B^{0}}^{*}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The charged \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\) states. \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\) is a common label for orbitally excited states with \(L=1\). Masses and widths come from theoretical estimates and ALEPH experimental data[11]. \(j_{q}\) is the vector sum of the orbital angular momentum and the spin of the light quark, \(J\) the total angular momentum of the meson (ie ‘spin’ of the meson). The uncertainty of the masses and widths of the broader states is considerable.

parameter tuning, as well as the branching ratios of the B-meson decays[11]. See appendix A for details.

### The generation

The events were generated including gluon splitting and flavour excitation as well as lowest order \(b\bar{b}\) production. In order to make it feasible to generate the required number of events a patched version of the PYTHIA program, in which events are generated in a modified way, was used[14]:

* After generating the parton-level event, it was checked that there is at least one \(b\) quark passing some rapidity and \(p_{\rm T}\) cuts. Events which have no chance of passing further cuts are thus never hadronized.
* After hadronization, it was checked that the event has the desired features for the study: The event should contain a \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}\) and the chain \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}\to{\rm J}/\!\psi\)\({\rm K}^{0}\), \({\rm J}/\!\psi\)\(\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\), \({\rm K}^{0}\to{\rm K}^{0}_{\rm S}\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\). The decays \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}\to{\rm J}/\!\psi\)\({\rm K}^{0}\) and \({\rm J}/\!\psi\)\(\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) were forced. The muons were required to have \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>\) 5 GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|\)\(<\) 2.5, and both pions were required to have \(p_{\rm T}\)\(>\) 0.5 GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|\)\(<\) 2.5. (These requirements were then refined during the analysis.)* To further speed up the generation, each parton level event passing the first step was hadronized up to 20 times until it passed the second step.

### Cross sections

The cross section for the basic hard-scattering process was 5.2 mb for \(p_{\mathrm{T}hard}>10\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|<5\) (for both outgoing partons). Note that the outgoing partons from the hard scatter are not normally \(b\) quarks; \(b\) quarks may be created during the parton-shower process.

The fraction of generated events written over the total number of generated events takes into account the production cross section of \(\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0}\) as well as the branching ratios of the non-forced decays. In the generations, 1000 events were written and 800000 20 were generated. The factor 20 comes from using the same parton level event many times, and it may be slightly overestimated. The ratio thus is \(N_{written}/N_{gen}=6.25\cdot 10^{-5}\).

The BR for the forced decays have to be put in by hand:

\[BR(\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0} \rightarrow\mathrm{J}/\psi\ \mathrm{K}^{0}\ ) =7.5\cdot 10^{-4}\] \[BR(\mathrm{J}/\psi \rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\ ) =5.97\cdot 10^{-2}\]

Taking into account that there should be as many \(\mathrm{B}^{0}\) events as there are \(\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0}\) ones thus giving twice as many events in a real study, this gives a final cross section for the reaction of \(\sigma=29.2\) pb, implying \(292\cdot 10^{3}\) events for 1 LHC low-luminosity year of \(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

Normally, a reconstruction efficiency of 0.95 per hadron and 0.8 per lepton is assumed. The lepton reconstruction efficiency includes identification and trigger efficiency. For the \(\mathrm{B}^{0}\) final state we have \(0.95^{2}\cdot 0.8^{2}\). (During the analysis, a reconstruction efficiency of 0.95 was also used when searching for the tagging pions.)

It was also required, during the analysis, that at least one muon had \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>6\) GeV/\(c\) to provide the first-level trigger, and both muons were required to have a pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.2\) which is the range covered by the muon spectrometers. Out of the 2000 generated events, 1668 passed these tighter cuts.

In order to be able to discriminate the secondary B vertex from the primary vertex, one must put a minimum lifetime cut on the \(\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0}\). A value of 0.5 ps was used, which is the same as in the lepton-tag study. Also, one must demand that the \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\) decays within the tracker to be able to reconstruct the decay. For that purpose, the decay of the \(\mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\) is required to occur at a distance of between 1 and 50 cm from the primary vertex. Of the above 1668 events, 702 passed these cuts.

We arrive at an estimated number of fully reconstructed events in the \(\mathrm{B}^{0},\mathrm{B}^{0}\ \rightarrow\mathrm{J}/\psi\ \mathrm{K}^{0}_{\mathrm{S}}\) decay channel of \(N_{rec}=59\cdot 10^{3}\) per year. This sample is about 2.6 times larger than the number of 'lepton-tag' events.

### B\({}^{**}\) production

Out of the 1668 \(\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0}\) events passing the tighter cuts on the muons during the analysis, 285 were produced as \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\). Taking the branching ratio of 2/3 for the decay \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\rightarrow\mathrm{B}^{0(*)}\pi^{+}\) into account, this gives a total production rate for the \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\) of \(285/1668\cdot 3/2=0.26\). This is slightly below the value of 0.30 set in the PYTHIA parameters. To check whether there is a tendency for the B\({}^{0}\) produced as B\({}^{**}\) to have lower than average momenta, a check was made without these tighter muon cuts. Then, 346 B\({}^{**}\) was produced out of 1984 B\({}^{0}\). (The 16 still missing are due to the presence of multiple \(b\bar{b}\)-pairs in the event which was not handled properly in the analysis program.) This production rate is slightly higher, and if one looks at only the B\({}^{**}\)-events which did _not_ make it through the refined muon cuts, one obtains 0.29. This is an important observation since it means that the B\({}^{**}\) suffers more from demanding a high \(p_{T}\) on the B\({}^{0}\), another reason to investigate whether it is possible to lower the \(p_{T}\) cuts on the muons by using the hadronic calorimeter, as has been suggested earlier[3].

## 3 The Analysis Procedure

Since the lepton-tag study showed that the B\({}^{0}\) in the decay B\({}^{0}\to\) J/\(\psi\) K\({}^{0}_{\rm S}\) is cleanly detected, the momentum and energy of the B\({}^{0}\) in the generated events were obtained directly from the simulated data, i.e. assuming 100% reconstruction efficiency[2]. The reconstruction efficiency was instead taken into account when estimating the total number of events. No smearing of the momentum vectors was applied, but precise measurements of the momenta are probably not essential for the tagging method except when doing the vertex reconstructions.

_During the analysis_, no lifetime cuts were placed on the \(\bar{\mbox{B}}^{0}\) and the K\({}^{0}_{\rm S}\) as these reduced the statistics too much. They were, however, taken into account when estimating the total number of events.

### Forming B\(\pi\) combinations

Since ATLAS has no hadron identification, it cannot distinguish pions from kaons or protons and consequently all of these must be treated as potential candidates for the correlated pion, which will be referred to as \(\pi_{**}\). (As a purely academic test to compare with the results from the ALEPH collaboration, a run was also made assuming that ATLAS _could_ identify the pions.) The hadrons involved in the reconstruction of the \(\bar{\mbox{B}}^{0}\) are not considered.

In order to qualify as a candidate, the particle must pass a \(p_{T}\) cut ranging from 0.5 GeV/\(c\) (detector limit) to 1.4 GeV/\(c\), and must form a B\(\pi\)-system with a mass less than a cut value ranging from 5.7 GeV/\(c^{2}\) to 7.8 GeV/\(c^{2}\). This is to avoid forming combinations with very-high-momentum tracks, especially in the forward directions, having nothing to do with the B. The particles must also have an impact parameter from the primary vertex less than 250 \(\mu\)m, to remove daughters from long-lived particles which cannot be correlated to the B\({}^{0}\), and pass a 95% probability cut to simulate the reconstruction efficiency of hadrons.

In one part of the analysis, the candidates were also required to lie within a disc in the \(\eta-\phi\) plane of a radius from 0.1 to 1.0 around the \(\bar{\mbox{B}}^{0}\).

### Right-sign and wrong-sign particles

All the candidates for the \(\pi_{**}\) can be used to form B\(\pi\) combinations, but since we know that in the simulated sample, the B meson is \(\bar{\mbox{B}}^{0}\), only the \(\pi^{-}\) can come from a decayingB**\({}^{**-}\)**. These are classified as _'right-sign'_, as opposed to the** \(\pi^{+}\) **which are** _'wrong-sign'_**, and cannot originate from the decay of the B**\({}^{**-}\)**.**

### The max-\(p_{\rm L}\) and max-\(\cos\theta^{*}\) algorithms

**Besides the** \(\pi_{**}\)**, a number of other particles pass the above cuts, mainly from the fragmentation of the** \(b\) **quark. To select, from these, the pion from the resonance, one makes use of the fact that the B meson should take most momentum and leave the fragmentation particles behind. The** \(\pi_{**}\) **is thus, on average, expected to have a higher momentum than the others, which can be quantified in a number of ways.**

**In this study two different variables have been used, the component of the momentum of the candidate in the direction of the** \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}(p_{\rm L})\)**, and** \(\cos\theta^{*}\)**, where** \(\theta^{*}\) **is the angle between the emission direction of the pion and the boost direction, after doing a Lorentz boost to the rest frame of the B**\(\pi\) **system**[**6**]****. These variables are correlated.**

**Several algorithms using these two variables have been tested, basically consisting of choosing the particle with the maximum** \(p_{\rm L}\) **or** \(\cos\theta^{*}\) **after weighting** \(p_{\rm L}\) **or** \(\cos\theta^{*}\) **with a factor depending on** \(m_{B\pi}\)**.**

**Depending on the cuts, between (on average) 0.3 and 5 particles are accepted as candidates. This is morethan at LEP (for the corresponding cuts) and makes the selection of the** \(\pi_{**}\) **more difficult. Because of this, it has also been studied if the results can be improved by throwing away events in which the number of candidate particles are larger than a certain number. Indeed, this proved rewarding.**

### The 'closest-to-\(m_{B^{**}}\)' algorithm

**Another method was tried, in which the candidates were chosen solely upon their position in the B**\(\pi\) **mass spectrum. Since the possibility to have a pion from the resonance is confined to a narrow mass range it was expected that choosing the particle which had a mass corresponding to the peak in the B**\({}^{**}\) **mass spectrum with highest production probability would prove useful. However, the background also peaks in this range, and** \({\rm B}^{**}\) **are only formed in about 17% of the events. Thus the discrimination from the background proved too low.**

**When one has more (simulated) statistics of the** \({\rm B}^{**}\) **mass peaks, it may be worthwhile to try this method once again, especially if the higher mass peaks prove to be rather narrow, as is believed. In that case one will probably also have to take the mass resolution of the detector into account.**

### What was omitted from the analysis?

**There are a number of question marks left after this study. It has not been checked what pileup does to the results, even though at low luminosity it is not believed to be a major problem, and the finite detector resolution has not been taken into account.**

**The** \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}\) **and** \({\rm K}^{0}_{\rm S}\) **lifetime cuts reduced the statistics so much that they were not used during the analysis. There was an indication that the quality factor after applying these cuts was** _lower_ **than without the cuts, the result was about two standard deviations worse.**One has no _a priori_ reason to believe this, but it will have to be studied with a larger simulated sample.

The background is assumed to be similar to what the 'lepton-tag' study showed, which for the \(\mathrm{J}/\!\!\psi\ \to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay was a very clean \(\mathrm{B}^{0}\) signal, but this has not been studied. In case one would want to combine the \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\) tagging method with the jet-charge tagging, a study of the correlations between the two methods have to be done.

## 4 Results

### The pp events at 14 TeV

In order to understand the structure of the events, a 'poor-man's' event display was made by plotting the distribution of the charged hadrons in the final state in the \(\eta-\phi\) plane - see Figures 2 & 3. In these displays, the \(\mathrm{\bar{B}}^{0}\) and the other B meson are marked, as well as the \(\pi_{**}\) and the particles coming from the same'string' as the \(\mathrm{\bar{B}}^{0}\) in the PYTHIA event record.

The results were somewhat unexpected, in the sense that in most of the events no clear 'jet' could be seen around the \(\mathrm{\bar{B}}^{0}\), and the B string was spread out to large angular distances from the \(\mathrm{\bar{B}}^{0}\). In general, it appears that there are _more_ particles close to the other B meson than around the \(\mathrm{\bar{B}}^{0}\). This distribution is however biased from requiring the \(\mathrm{\bar{B}}^{0}\) to have a high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and thus take a greater part of the string momentum, leaving less momentum for the other particles. Also, while the decay products of the \(\mathrm{\bar{B}}^{0}\) have been removed from the plot, that is not the case with particles coming from the other B. The total number of particles is of course larger than in a LEP event.

Figure 2: An example of a \(b\overline{b}\) event at 14000 GeV / \(c^{2}\), projected onto the \(\eta-\phi\) plane. Marked with circles are, in diminishing order, \(\overline{\rm B}^{0}\), the other B meson, and the pion from the decay of the \({\rm B}^{**-}\). Box size is \(p_{\rm T}\) and only particles with \(p_{\rm T}\ >0.5\) GeV / \(c^{2}\) are shown. Note that the graph exceeds the detector dimensions in \(\eta\).

Figure 3: The same event as in Figure 2, but here in the form of a lego plot. In white are the three particles marked with circles in Figure 2, and in grey the particles from the \(\bar{\rm B}^{0}\) string.

### Results from the max-\(p_{\rm L}\) and max-\(\cos\theta^{*}\) algorithms

The algorithms were run with different sets of parameters. There are four of these, and the covered values are described in Table 2.

The best result (highest \(Q\)) was observed with the max-\(\cos\theta^{*}\) algorithm, with the parameters described below. (Note that for a value of \(n_{cand}\) cut= 1, the max-\(\cos\theta^{*}\) and the max-\(p_{\rm L}\) algorithms coincide, since no selection is taking place. For other values of the \(n_{cand}\) cut, the results from the max-\(\cos\theta^{*}\) algorithm were slightly better.) The right-sign and wrong-sign plots are shown in Figure 4.

* \(m_{B\pi}\) cut= 6.0 GeV/\(c^{2}\). The results are fairly stable for values between 5.8 and 6.1 GeV/\(c^{2}\).
* \(p_{\rm T}\) cut= 1.0 GeV/\(c\). Roughly the same results for values between 0.7 and 1.2 GeV/\(c\).
* \(\Delta r\) cut= 0.5. Smaller cones than 0.4 give much worse results, but for larger cones the results are stable (for a fixed \(m_{B\pi}\) cut).
* \(n_{cand}\) cut= 1. The results for a value of two are also good, other values about the same.

This gave the result (note that only the statistical error in \(\omega\) has been propagated to sin 2\(\beta\)):

\[\omega = 0.28\pm 0.02\] \[\epsilon = 0.26\] \[Q = 0.052\pm 0.01\] \[\delta\sin 2\beta = 0.030\pm 0.003\]

To give a feeling of what the different cuts do, plots of a few quantities were made when the cut on that particular variable was disabled. These are shown in Figures 5 - 8. Note that these contain _all_ the candidates in the event, not only the one selected as in Figure 4, and thus the \(n_{cand}\) cut was not in effect in any of the plots. The candidates with right sign and wrong sign are shown separately.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|l|} \hline Parameter & Values & Explanation \\ \hline \(p_{\rm T}\) cut & \(0.5-1.4\) GeV/\(c\) & \(p_{\rm T}\) cut on candidate particles \\ \(m_{B\pi}\) cut & \(5.7-7.8\) GeV/\(c^{2}\) & upper limit on mass of B\pi system \\ \(\Delta r\) cut & \(0.1-1.0\) & max. distance between candidate and B\({}^{0}\) in \(\eta-\phi\) plane \\ \(n_{cand}\) cut & \(1-\infty\) & max. number of candidates to consider event \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Figure 4: The mass distributions of the max-cos \(\theta^{*}\) right-sign and wrong-sign combinations for the optimal parameters. The right-sign combinations are shown in solid lines, the wrong-sign ones in dashed. Of the 1688 events passing the \(\bar{\mathrm{B}}^{0}\) reconstruction cuts, 329 were tagged right and 138 wrong. The narrow \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\) mass peaks are visible in the right-sign plot between 5.7 and 5.8 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c^{2}\).

Figure 5: The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distribution of _all_ the candidates without the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut (and the \(n_{eand}\) cut) but with the other cuts as for the optimal values. Right-sign candidates are shown in solid lines, wrong-sign ones in dashed.

Figure 6: The distribution of the mass of the B\(\pi\) system for _all_ the candidates without the cut on B\(\pi\) mass and \(\Delta r\) (and on number of candidates), but with the \(p_{\rm T}\) cut at optimal value. Right-sign candidates are shown in solid lines, wrong-sign ones in dashed.

Figure 7: The \(\Delta r\) distribution of _all_ the candidates without the \(\Delta r\) cut (and the \(n_{eand}\) cut), but with the other cuts at optimal values. Note that the \(\Delta r\) cut and the \(m_{B_{\pi}}\) cut are highly correlated. If the \(m_{B_{\pi}}\) cut also was disabled, the distribution would not fall of as it does at \(\Delta r\approx 0.5\). Right-sign candidates are shown in solid lines, wrong-sign ones in dashed.

The effects of varying the parameters around the optimal values are shown i Figures 9 - 12. Note the one-standard-deviation error bars showing the statistical error.

In general, one can say that the lower the \(m_{B\pi}\) cut, the better the result, down to where one starts cutting into the \(\bar{B}^{**}\) mass peaks. This is not unexpected since the correlation between the \(\pi_{**}\) and the \(\bar{B}^{0}\) should be stronger than between the fragmentation pions and the \(\bar{B}^{0}\).

The dependence on the \(p_{T}\) cut proved to be rather strong below 0.7 GeV /c, but above that value, the differences were fairly small. (It can be seen in Figure 5 that below a \(p_{T}\) of 0.8 GeV/c, there are about as many wrong-sign candidates as right-sign ones.) This is probably due to the large number of particles with low \(p_{T}\) that accidentally form masses in the region of the \(\bar{B}^{**}\) mass. The correlated pions themselves have fairly high \(p_{T}\) since the generation restricts the \(\bar{B}^{0}\) to have a high \(p_{T}\), and are not affected so much by this cut.

The cut on \(\Delta r\) was introduced to complement the mass cut in eliminating the particles at large angles from the \(\bar{B}^{0}\). Not unexpectedly, a very small cone size (\(<0.4\)) degraded the efficiency to a high degree, but a small increase in performance was observed for sizes 0.4 - 0.6, depending on the values of the other parameters. This cut is highly correlated to the cut on the \(B\pi\) mass, and for a \(m_{B\pi}\) cut of 6.0 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), only a few candidates are present outside \(\Delta r=0.5\), see Figure 7.

Last, the \(n_{eand}\) cut skips the event if too large a number of particles pass the above cuts. It was observed that the wrong-tag fraction for events with many candidates for the \(\pi_{**}\) was high, and it proved rewarding to restrict the tagging to the events in which only one or two candidates were present. However, the observed number of events, due to the

tight cuts in these cases, are few and thus it may not be statistically very significant.

### Tagging on the \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\) events

If one specifically looks at the 285 events in the analysed sample which contained a \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\), one finds that it was possible to tag 214 of these. Out of the tagged events, 162 were tagged right, and out of these 128 were tagged on the \(\pi_{**}\). This gives \(\omega=0.24\), \(\epsilon=0.75\) and \(Q=0.20\)! It is clear that the tight cuts do not affect these events very much, and thus the production probability for the \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\), currently estimated at \(0.30\pm 0.08\) by the ALEPH collaboration, becomes a very important factor for this tagging method[6]. The cut on the number of candidates was not taken into account above, since the max-\(\cos\theta^{*}\) obviously is doing well without this.

A naive extrapolation of the above results indicate that if the \(\mathrm{B}^{**}\) production rate should prove to be one standard deviation higher than the current estimate, ie 0.38, one would (still without the \(n_{eand}\) cut), obtain a quality factor of \(Q=0.043\) as opposed to the current result of \(Q=0.035\) (which can be seen in Figure 12).

### Results from an ATLAS detector with \(\pi\) identification

In order to better understand what is causing the difference between these results and the ones obtained by the ALEPH collaboration, a run was made in which it was assumed that ATLAS could identify the pions.

No \(\Delta r\) cut was used, but the best result was obtained with the other parameters at the same values as without \(\pi\) identification. This gave \(\omega=0.24\), \(\epsilon=0.26\), \(Q=0.072\) and

Figure 9: This graph shows the dependence of \(Q\) on the \(m_{B\pi}\) cut for the values of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut of 0.9, 1.0 and 1.1 \(\mathrm{GeV}/c\). The \(n_{eand}\) cut is 1 and \(\Delta r\) cut 0.5.

\(\delta\)sin \(2\beta=0.036\). The average number of candidates in the events went down from 0.71 without identification to 0.61.

The ability to identify the pionso obviously made the sample much cleaner. The wrong-tag fraction obtained here is actually lower than that obtained by the ALEPH collaboration, but they used much less tight cuts and thus had higher tagging efficiency.

## 5 Conclusions

The quality factor from using the B\({}^{**}\) tag in ATLAS was not as good as at LEP, but the vastly higher numbers of \(b\overline{b}\) events means that one will be able to measure sin \(2\beta\) with an accuracy of \(\pm(0.030\pm 0.003)\). This should be compared to the expected performance of the lepton tag of \(\pm 0.020\).

Even though the B\({}^{**+}\)\(\rightarrow\) B\({}^{0(*)}\)\(\pi^{+}\) tagging method proved slightly less efficient it will be able to provide an additional tag besides the lepton tag, with different systematical and independent statistical errors. Thus it will be possible to cross check the results of several independent methods and to combine them to improve the statistical precision on the measurement of sin \(2\beta\). A combination of the lepton tag and the B\({}^{**}\) measurements on sin \(2\beta\) should give a statistical precision of \(\pm 0.017\).

Several things were not studied here. Among the most important should be to verify the results with a larger data sample and using the lifetime cuts on the \(\overline{\rm B}{}^{0}\) and the K\({}^{0}_{\rm S}\), since there seemed to exist a tendency for lower quality factors when including these.

It may be possible to identify one of the muons at \(p_{\rm T}\) lower than 5 GeV/\(c\), through the

hadronic calorimeter. This would make it possible to make the \(\Pgt\) cut on the muonsless restrictive and thus increase the available number of events, even more important when there is an indication that the \(\Bg^{**}\) are formed with lower average momentum than the 'ordinary' \(\Bg^{0}\).

It is important to determine the production rate of the \(\Bg^{**}\) more precisely, since this obviously will influence the results of this tagging method.

The background was assumed to be the same as in the lepton-tag study, but this has to be verified. The effects of pileup should also be studied, and the systematic uncertainties of this method are not known.

There is an uncertainty as to the simulated events, since the PARJ parameter which controls the production probabilities of the orbitally excited mesons is the same for all flavours. Thus, when tuning these to the observed \(\Bg^{**}\) production, one could change the behaviour of other particles which may affect the study. There are modified versions of the PYTHIA program in which these probabilities can be set individually for each quark flavour and these should be used to verify the results.
