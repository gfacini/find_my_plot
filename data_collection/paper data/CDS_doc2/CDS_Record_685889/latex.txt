[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]

Pattern recognition and second-level triggering have determined the straw tracker geometry even more than electron identification [1]. In such a geometry, there are only two ways to improve the straw tracker accuracy and thus the overall inner tracker momentum resolution:

a) in a first step, one may give up the TR-function and therefore consider a straw tracker without radiator. The total amount of material in the inner tracker below a radius of 110 cm would then decrease from 20% to 16% X\({}_{0}\)[2]. The gain in momentum resolution from this decrease in tracker material is negligible, even at low momenta (\(\nu_{T}~{}\leq~{}30~{}\) GeV), where multiple scattering is dominant.

b) a significant improvement in the single straw drift-time accuracy, which is \(\sim\) 160 \(\mu\) with the chosen Xenon gas mixture and operating point, may be achieved by considering a faster gas, such as Argon, with higher signal to noise. The straw occupancy would thus be reduced and the performance at high luminosity would be more robust.

## 2 The improve the tracking performance of the straw tracker and ID momentum resolution

The overall momentum resolution has been calculated for the simplified barrel layout, using the detector parameters given in Table 1.

The measurement accuracy of the straw tracker depends on the single straw drift-time accuracy \(\sigma\) and on the effective number of straws n \(\ast\)\(\epsilon\),which can be used in the measurement:

\[overall~{}structural{}reacreuracy\sim\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n~{}\ast~{}\epsilon}}\]

where n is the number of straws crossed by the particle (\(\sim\) 36 for \(\nu_{T}~{}>\) 1 GeV), and \(\epsilon\) is the drift-time efficiency of a single straw, i.e. the probability to find the correct hit inside the road defined to measure the track momentum. This probability depends on the straw occupancy, since out-of-time hits will shadow the correct hit more and more often as luminosity increases.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c|c|c|c|c||} \hline Type & Number of hits \(N\) & \(R\), cm & \(Z\), cm & \(\sigma\) or strip width in \(\mu\) \\ \hline \hline Barrel TRT & 36 & 63 to 107 & \(\pm\)80.0 & calculated \\ \hline Silicon & l & 11.5 & \(\pm\)80.0 & 50 \\  & l & 20.0 & \(\pm\)80.0 & 50 \\  &.2 & 30.0 & \(\pm\)80.0 & 75 \\  &.2 & 40.0 & \(\pm\)80.0 & 100 \\  &.2 & 50.0 & \(\pm\)80.0 & 100 \\  &.2 & 60.0 & \(\pm\)80.0 & 100 \\ \hline Beam constraint & & 0 & & 20 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1:In order to calculate the drift-time accuracy of a single straw and its efficiency as a function of the luminosity, a detailed MC model of the straw tracker was used [3]; this model has been checked carefully by comparing its predictions with TRT prototype test beam data [4], and includes all the important features of a single straw:

* the exact composition of the straw gas,
* the ionization losses of charged particles in the straw gas [5], with primary collisions distributed along the track as \(W(x)\equiv\exp(-x/x_{0})\), where \(x_{0}\) is the average distance between primary collisions for the given gas,
* gas gain fluctuations \(G\equiv 0.25\sqrt{E({\rm KeV})}\), where \(E\) is the energy deposited in the given gas ( the energy resolution is set to a 25% FWHM for a 6 keV Fe\({}^{55}\) source),
* the dependence of the electron drift velocity on the electric field in the gas, as predicted by the MAGBOLTZ program, which has been compared to measurements in a magnetic field [4].
* the noise of the electronics, simulated as \(E_{0}\sin(2\pi\omega t+2\pi n)\), where \(E_{0}\) is Gaussian-distributed with a \(\sigma\) (in eV) depending on the gas gain.
* a straw tube attenuation length of 4 m [3].
* a signal propagation time along the straw of 4 ns/m [3],
* signal reflections from the far end of the straw,
* a signal shaping corresponding to the measured signal from an Fe\({}^{55}\) source.

The calculations have been done for the two following cases:

1. a Xe/(\({\rm CF_{4}}\)/(\({\rm O_{2}}\) (70%/20%/10%) gas mixture, where Xenon is chosen for TR-photon absorption,
2. a Ar/(\({\rm CF_{4}}\)/(\({\rm O_{2}}\)/20%/10%) gas mixture, i.e. no TR-function of the straw tracker.

The main differences between these two cases are:

* the total drift time for Xe-filled straws is 38 ns in a magnetic field of 2 T, whereas for Ar-filled straws it is 25 ns. The occupancy of Ar-filled straws will therefore be reduced by \(\sim\) 20%,
* the operational gas gain for Ar-filled straws may be up to 3 times larger (9 10\({}^{4}\)) than for Xe-filled straws (3 10\({}^{4}\)), for the same probability of limited streamer pulses (\(\leq 10^{-4}\)) [6]. Such high gas gains for Ar-filled straws would however have to be checked for ageing effects,
* this higher gas gain for Ar-filled straws and the higher ion mobility in Argon give an additional gain in the signal to noise ratio: for Xe-filled straws the effective noise is \(N\sim 70\) eV, which results in a minimum threshold for particle detection of THR = 200 eV. For Ar-filled straws, \(N\sim 15\) eV and THR = 50 eV.

The results of the MC simulations are shown in Fig. 1 for the distribution of hit arrival times on the straw with the maximum expected occupancy of \(30\%\), corresponding to a particle rate of \(\sim 11\) MHz. Fig. 1 clearly shows the peak of correct particle hits and a tail (for smaller drift times) of background hits. In order to select "correct" hits, a road of width \(\pm\Delta y\) in \(\mu\) has been defined around the predicted track position. The value of \(\Delta y\) determines the drift-time efficiency of the straw and its accuracy, from which one can extract the overall momentum resolution.

As can be seen from Figs. 2 and 3, which show the expected overall momentum resolution as a function of the value of \(\Delta\ y\) for low occupancy (fig. 2) and for the maximum occupancy (fig. 3), the optimal value for \(\Delta\ y\) is \(\sim 320\)\(\mu\), and is quite insensitive to the choice of gas and to the straw occupancy.

For this optimal road width, Figs. 4 and 5 show the drift-time accuracy and efficiency for a single straw as a function of the occupancy. For Figs. 2 to 5, the occupancy is defined as that of the straw at the innermost radius in the simplified layout (R = 63 cm).

Table 2 gives the overall barrel tracker momentum resolution numbers for the two choices of gas quoted above and for a luminosity of \(L=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\).

## 3 Conclusions

The accuracy quoted for Ar-filled straws in Table 2 is in good agreement with measurements done for a similar gas mixture for SDC. It may be possible to improve it even further with a thinner wire (25 to 30 \(\mu\) instead of 50 \(\mu\) diameter) and faster shaping electronics (5 ns instead of 12.5 ns rise-time). Such modifications would clearly need much more detailed studies on straw ageing and on the front-end electronics than are available today.

As is shown in Table 2, the possible improvements to the overall momentum resolution of the ATLAS inner tracker from even such considerable modifications of the straw tracker design are quite limited and do not, in our view, warrant the corresponding loss of the electron identification capability. With the TR-function the overall tracker momentum resolution is well within the specifications of \(\Delta P_{\perp}/P_{\perp}|_{500\mu\perp}\simeq 30\%\)), even at the highest LHC luminosities.
