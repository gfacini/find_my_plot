**Abstract**

We study the problem of electron identification using a vector tracker, based on the old EAGLE B design. Problems of pattern recognition, the effect of material on electron reconstruction, energy-momentum matching, event pileup, rejection of electron pair background from isolated \(\pi^{0}/\eta/\gamma\), and backgrounds from electromagnetic jets are considered.

This note presents the current status of the investigation of electron identification by using the inner detector to reconstruct the momentum of electron candidates and match them with the calorimeter energy. This has been the normal method of electron identification in previous magnetic hadron collider experiments. Nonetheless, it must be critically reappraised for the LHC environment, given the unprecedented level of pileup to be faced. In particular, the high speed and granularity required for an LHC tracker system means that only a few precision tracker layers, with pixel quality information, can be realistically afforded. In this note the performance of such a sparse vector tracker system is investigated, and results are presented on its electron identification abilities and background rejection in the central region. It should be noted that many of the studies are general to any vector tracker design, whatever technology is used. The calorimeter performance is also included, since it is crucial to the E/p matching cut. These sections are relevant to all ASCOT/EAGLE designs.

Single electron datasets have been generated using the DICE/SLUG/GEANT packages at transverse momenta of 10, 20, 40, 100 and 1000 GeV and at \(\eta=0\) and \(\eta=1.2\). Minimum bias events have also been generated to investigate the effect of pileup. The results obtained are presented in sections 4 (calorimeter), 5 (tracking) and 6 (electron identification).

The most serious background causing 'fake' electrons is expected to arise from electron pairs produced by isolated \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) with Dalitz decay or external \(\gamma\) conversion. Over 100000 \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) decays have been generated to study the rejection available against this background (section 7).

Jets present the most difficult challenge for the tracker. Jets satisfying a level 1 electron trigger algorithm have been studied using the electron identification criteria (section 8). Results on a level 2 tracking trigger can be found in [1].

2 Layout of Conceptual Detector

The basic detector used for the simulations in this study is based on the Eagle B concept. For simplicity the central tracker is assumed to consist of uniform concentric cylinders, neglecting practical aspects such as overlapping surfaces and inactive areas. The barrel region is assumed to cover \(|\,\eta\mid\leq 1.2\) and to be enclosed in a homogeneous 2T solenoidal magnetic field. The outer tracker represents the SIT silicon tracker design and consists of 6 layers at radii of 95, 97, 99, 101, 103 and 105 cm. Four layers measure the \(\pi\phi\) coordinate with 200 \(\mu\)m strips each 50 mm long, and 2 layers measure the z coordinate with pads of 1 mm pitch, each 9 mm long. Each layer is 2% of a radiation length thick at normal incidence.

The inner tracker is loosely based on the SITV design with 4 layers at radii 10, 15, 20 and 25 cm. Each layer consists of r\(\phi\) strips, 50 \(\mu\)m in pitch by 50 mm in length, with 1% \(X_{0}\) thickness. The beam pipe is a 5 mm beryllium tube with 50 mm internal diameter.

The calorimeter is the default DICE pointing geometry, assumed to have an ideal energy measurement (no non-linearities or constant terms), with a cell size of \(0.02\times 0.02\) in \(\eta\times\phi\) and \(80X_{0}\) (!) in depth. The homogeneous calorimeter absorber material has the radiation length of lead. It is considerably more dense than the favoured EAGLE LAr accordion design, thus the lateral shower spread is smaller than that expected for the accordion leading to a less precise determination of the cluster centroid. No additional material in the form of moderators, coil or cryostat was placed before the calorimeter. The basic layout is shown in Figure 1.

In order to study the effect of additional material on the combined tracker-calorimeter system, the Eagle B TRD is in some cases added as passive material between the inner and outer trackers. The overall track finding performance may be improved by using the TRD hits, but the purpose of this note is to investigate whether the stand-alone performance of the vector tracker concept is adequate for electron identification. Therefore the electron identification algorithms have been optimised without this additional material.

Figure 1: Layout of the tracker

## 3 Effect of Material on Electron Momenta

The effect of material is to introduce fluctuations into the electron trajectory as energy is lost through bremsstrahlung. The mean electron momentum drops according to the radiation length traversed in an almost energy independent fashion, although the magnetic field traps electrons in the extreme hard bremsstrahlung tail of the distribution. Figure 2 shows the relative momentum of the highest energy charged particle crossing each layer of the tracker with respect to the original electron momentum for two extreme cases; minimum material at \(\eta=0\) with no TRD (giving 6% of \(X_{0}\) before the outer tracker and 18% total before the calorimeter), and maximum material at \(\eta=1.2\), the end of the barrel tracking region, with TRD (giving 28% of \(X_{0}\) before the outer tracker and 50% before the calorimeter).

These fluctuations complicate pattern recognition, in particular for matching track vectors found in the inner and outer trackers. The discrimination against incorrect matches given by the constant curvature constraint of an ideal helix, whilst useful for muons and hadrons, is considerably weakened for electrons because of the large set of possible trajectories needed to allow for almost any value of energy loss at each material layer. At the calorimeter this radiated energy appears as a 'fan', spreading the cluster out in the \(r\phi\) direction. Thus bremsstrahlung creates pattern recognition problems in both the calorimeter and the tracking detectors. Optimized algorithms have been developed.

The electron search strategy follows that expected in the real experiment. First the electron candidates are found in the electromagnetic calorimeter (simulating the trigger), using a cluster algorithm. Next the tracker is searched in a road joining the calorimeter trigger to the vertex region. After reconstructing candidate tracks, several cuts (such as on the energy-momentum match) are made to remove backgrounds. The calorimeter energy measurement is considered first.

### Calorimeter cell energies

Figure 3 shows the number of calorimeter cells which fire for electrons and unconverted photons of 10 and 100 GeV, as a function of the threshold applied to the individual cell energies. As expected the shower size increases with energy. There is little difference between electrons and unconverted photons, indicating that the effect of material on the calorimeter cluster is relatively small. With a realistic threshold of \(\sim 100\) MeV [2] the shower typically occupies \(\sim 5\) cells at 10 GeV and \(\sim 30\) cells at 100 GeV.

Figure 3: Number of cells above threshold in the calorimeter

Figure 4 shows the effect of the cell threshold on the energy seen in the calorimeter. With a 100 MeV threshold, 89% of the energy is seen at 10 GeV, rising to 97% at 100 GeV.

Figure 4: Total energy seen in the calorimeter vs cell threshold

The individual cell energies were then smeared by 10%/\(\sqrt{E}\) to simulate the resolution of the LAr calorimeter, and cells below 100 MeV were removed. Figure 5 shows the resulting energy measurement for unconverted photons and electrons of 10 GeV, using a 3 \(\times\) 3 window to define the cluster, centered on the highest energy cell. The large tail of badly measured electrons (in contrast to the gaussian response to photons) shows the effect of material. Bremsstrahlung tends to spread out the cluster in the \(r\phi\) plane, leading to a loss of energy outside the window. Hard bremsstrahlung can give separate clusters, making a peak finding algorithm inappropriate for electrons. Very hard bremsstrahlung, can lead to a low energy electron shower remote from the leading cluster, which will then fake a direct photon (a potentially serious background to signals such as \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\)).

Electrons giving problems with energy measurement are thus the same as those giving rise to tracking difficulties. In extreme cases this leads to an irreducible level of badly reconstructed events. These effects can be minimised by introducing as little material as possible, especially at small radii.

### Calorimeter cluster algorithm

The best cluster algorithm for a highly granular calorimeter appears to be a sliding window, shifted to find the local maximum enclosed energy, rather than centred on the highest peak. It should be sufficiently wide in the \(r\phi\) direction to allow for bremsstrahlung. Figure 6 shows the fraction of the true energy found in various size windows, for electron energies between 10 and 100 GeV. There is a clear gain in response if a larger window is used at high energies. At lower energies, a large window should be avoided since the pileup effect would become large compared to the true energy.

Figure 7 shows the fraction of electrons whose energy measurement is spoilt by bremsstrahlung (defined as more than 3 standard deviations from the maximum), as a function of the window size. Windows of \(3\times 7\), \(5\times 7\) and \(7\times 7\) give the least number of spoilt electrons. Figure 7 also shows the resulting energy resolution for each window. Based on these plots, an energy dependent window algorithm was chosen, with \(3\times 7\) cells for energies below 30 GeV, \(5\times 7\) cells up to 90 GeV, and \(7\times 7\) cells above 90 GeV. The nominal performance of \(10\%/\sqrt{E}\) is not attained at low energies because of the cell threshold.

### Effect of pileup on the calorimeter energy measurement

Pileup was simulated for the nominal luminosity of \(1.7\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), integrated over three 15 ns bunch crossings to allow for the speed of the calorimeter readout. This corresponds to an average of 60 minimum bias events superimposed to each electron trigger. For reasons explained in section 5.1, this level of pileup was also used for the tracking detectors, even though they will be fast enough to resolve individual bunch crossings.

Figure 8 shows the effect of the threshold cut on pile up. As expected the probability of a cell firing drops rapidly as the threshold rises and removes hits from secondary effects and low \(p_{T}\) tracks. The mean energy of the remaining cells rises. The net result of the 100 MeV cut is a reduction of about a factor 2 in the observed pileup energy.

Figure 8: Effect of threshold cut on pileupFigure 9 shows the energy measured for 10 GeV and 100 GeV electrons for the chosen window size with and without the pileup contribution. The mean energy inside the window is increased by a few hundred MeV and the width by between 10 and 20%. These effects are more significant at lower energies.

Figure 9: Energy in the calorimeter window with and without pileup

Figure 10 shows the pileup effect on an isolation rim one cell wide, surrounding a \(3\times 7\) cell window. It should be noted that the effect of high energy pileup has been reduced by the use of the sliding window algorithm, while the threshold cut has suppressed the low energy contribution.

For 10 GeV electrons a cut at 1.5 GeV measured energy in the rim is more than 99% efficient for isolated electrons, but the loss increases at 40 GeV. This shows that energy is leaking from the shower to the rim, and this dominates the pileup effect. An energy dependent window size eliminates this problem.

Figure 10: **Left) distribution of ‘isolation’ energy in a rim around a \(3\times 7\) calorimeter cell window. Right) integral plots measure the efficiency of a given isolation cutoff.**

Figure 11 shows the isolation energy for a \(5\times 7\) cell window, which preserves an efficiency greater than 99% for isolated electrons up to 90 GeV, even in the presence of pileup, using a cut of 1.5 GeV of energy in the rim. A \(7\times 7\) window is used for energies above 90 GeV.

Figure 11: Energy isolation for \(5\times 7\) and \(7\times 7\) windows.

### Calorimeter position resolution

Figure 12 shows the position resolution with respect to the electron direction at the vertex obtained from the calorimeter simulation. At 100 GeV this gives an isotropic resolution of around 2.5 mm with no measureable pile-up contribution. The \(\phi\) direction shows a displacement of 4 mm due to the magnetic field. Although the field 'fans out' the bremsstrahlung energy in this direction, there is no significant worsening of the position resolution, as the net effect on the cluster centroid cancels to first order. Removing the 100 MeV threshold cut makes no improvement to this resolution.

For 10 GeV electrons the resolution is slightly degraded by pileup and the threshold cut, but the main problem is a tail of the order of 1% of the electrons with too little deflection. Following catastrophic bremsstrahlung, these electrons have been swept by the field to outside the calorimeter cluster. We note that the test beam data from the LAr prototype [3] gives a position resolution of \(\sim 5\mathrm{mm}/\sqrt{E}\), which is considerably better than this simulation. Later results which require good position resolution are therefore pessimistic, even after making allowance for pileup degradation.

### Trigger Road

The tracker is examined in a road joining the triggering calorimeter cluster to the vertex region. In the \(\eta\) direction this road is \(\pm\)200 mm wide at the beam axis, to cover the vertex z-distribution, narrowing linearly to \(\pm\)30 mm at the calorimeter front face. In the \(r\phi\) direction the road has width \(\pm\)0.05 radians at the transverse vertex, corresponding to the magnetic deflection of a 10 GeV track from the calorimeter. It widens according to the trajectory of a 2 GeV track, since 2 GeV is the cutoff momentum used in a partner search for rejection of electron pair backgrounds. Despite this \(r\phi\) widening, the vertex spread is the dominant effect thus the solid angle subtended at the beam axis decreases with increasing radius in the road.

The inner tracker (SITV) has 4 layers with \(r\phi\) measuring strips of 50\(\mu\)m \(\times\) 50 mm. The number of strips inside the road increases from \(\sim\) 2000 at \(r\) = 10 cm to \(\sim\) 7000 at \(r\) = 25 cm. The outer tracker (SIT) has 4 layers of \(r\phi\) measuring strips of 200\(\mu\)m \(\times\) 50 mm and 2 layers measuring the z-coordinate with pads of 1 mm \(\times\) 9 mm. The number of strips/pads inside the road is \(\sim\) 4000 for each of the 6 layers.

Hits from tracks above 100 keV deposit sufficient energy to be digitised in silicon detectors. Figure 13 shows the number of hits per layer in the SITV and SIT for single electrons within the road. There is a tail caused by electrons with early showering especially in the outer tracker. There are also some events with no hits in the road following catastrophic bremsstrahlung.

Figure 13: number of digitisations per layer in trigger road, left) inner tracker, right) outer tracker, top) for single electron, bottom) electron plus pileup

The bottom part of the figure shows the effect of pileup from 60 superimposed minimum bias events. These were'standard' PYTHIA events with \(\sim 10\) particles produced per unit rapidity. Allowing for the frequent charge sharing in silicon strip detectors, which causes a single hit to fire adjacent strips, the average occupancy is \(\sim 0.2\%\) in the SIT and varies from 0.5 to 2% in the SITV.

Figure 14 illustrates the energy spectrum of the hits found in the trigger road. The top plots show that the early showering peaks towards low energies, but cuts off sharply at \(\sim 1\) MeV although silicon should register electrons from around 100 keV. This appears to be an artefact of the GEANT simulation which may have failed to register hits for particles created and then either absorbed or magnetically trapped inside the same layer. The number of low energy hits also reduced significantly in changing from GEANT program version 3.14 to 3.15 (the majority of these simulations were performed with the latter version as were figures 13 and 14). So it is probable that the number of accompanying hits due to early showering is underestimated, but as these neglected hits are of too low energy to penetrate more than one layer, they are unlikely to significantly effect pattern recognition for low occupancy detectors.

The bottom plots show primary track pileup as an approximate gaussian shape (for a log \(p_{T}\) scale) centred around \(\sim 500\) MeV, plus lower energy hits from backsplash. The proportion of these hits is considerably less than observed at existing hadron colliders [1]. Again it seems likely that GEANT simulations underestimate the hit occupancy. For this reason we feel it is prudent to add 60 minimum bias events pileup per trigger event.

### Track finding : track segments

Pattern recognition is performed separately in the inner and outer trackers. Track segments are constructed in the trigger road, requiring at least 5 hits in the 6 SIT layers and 3 hits in the 4 SITV layers. For each potential track segment a helix fit is performed including the transverse vertex and calorimeter \(\eta\)-position as additional measurements with respective precisions of 20 \(\mu\)m and 2.5 to 3.5 mm (weakly energy dependent as shown in section 4.4). Track segments are required to point within \(\pm 4\) cells of the calorimeter cluster centroid and to have transverse momenta greater than the smaller of \(E_{T(calo)}/4\) or 20 GeV. With these requirements a simple combinatorial algorithm takes very little computer time. Each track segment must have a \(\chi^{2}\) for the helix fit of better than 5.0 per degree of freedom, this cut is deliberately loose to allow for multiple scattering and bremsstrahlung deviations from an ideal helix. About 1% of electrons are found with one layer missing as the full layer segment fails the \(\chi^{2}\) cut. Track segments are required to have at least 2 distinct \(r\phi\) hits, otherwise only the segment with the best \(\chi^{2}\) is retained. Finally a hit in the inner layer of the SITV was made obligatory to reduce the conversion length available for electron pair background.

Silicon is a highly efficient detector material, but some allowance must be made for dead electronic channels given the complexity of these detectors. Assuming 98% hit efficiency per layer leads to 99.4% efficiency for \(\geq 5/6\) hits in the SIT. Since the obligatory inner SITV layer is appreciably smaller than the other layers, it is reasonable to demand 99% efficiency for this layer. Then the SITV efficiency would be 99.0% for \(\geq 3/4\) hits. These assumptions are included in the overall electron identification and track finding efficiencies in section 6.3. The dominant loss of efficiency for finding single electrons comes from hard bremsstrahlung causing track segments to fail the \(p_{T}>E_{T(calo)}/4\) cut.

At \(\eta=0\) ambiguous solutions occur for \(\sim 0.5\%\) of single electrons in SITV, \(\sim 2-4\%\) in SIT (the rate increases with energy). These ambiguities are caused by early shower development, their rate approximately doubles at \(\eta=1.2\) as expected from the increased thickness of material traversed. Pileup introduces only an extra \(\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$<$}}0.1\%\) of track segments in the outer tracker at 10 GeV, whereas \(\sim 60\%\) of the electrons are accompanied by pileup segments in the inner tracker. The SITV rate of accompanying pileup segments falls to \(\sim 20\%\) by \(p_{T}=100\) GeV due to the \(E_{T(calo)}/4\) requirement. Part of the difference between the performance of the inner and outer trackers follows from the imprecise z-coordinate measurement assumed in this simulation of the SITV, thus double-sided or pixel silicon detectors would greatly reduce this pileup.

### Track finding : matching segments and global helix fit

Figure 15 shows the fitted value of \(1/p_{T}\) for segments found in the SITV, plotted against \(1/p_{T}\) for those found in the SIT, using single electron data (no pileup) at \(p_{T}=10\) GeV. The central cluster results from clean electrons which are unaffected by bremsstrahlung. The flat band running to high values of \(1/p_{T}\) in the SIT, (ie low values of \(p_{T}\)), is due to bremsstrahlung after the SITV. The population with high values in both SIT and SITV is due to early bremsstrahlung, either before or in the SITV, which disturbs both measurements. Finally the region on the left of the plot, with low values of \(1/p_{T}\) (ie large values of \(p_{T}\)), is due to a bremsstrahlung photon which converts sufficiently early to be reconstructed in the outer tracker. These conversions have a low impact parameter at the beam axis, thus the vertex constraint causes them to be reconstructed with anartificially high \(p_{T}\) value.

Track segments are then matched between the SIT and SITV, and a global helix fit is performed for each combination. The combination with the best \(\chi^{2}\) is retained, with no \(\chi^{2}\) cut, since the electrons with hard bremsstrahlung give poor \(\chi^{2}\) values.

Figure 16 shows the global fitted \(1/p_{T}\) for the configuration with no TRD, for 20 GeV electrons without pileup at \(\eta=0\) and \(\eta=1.2\). At \(\eta=0\) about 70% of the tracks lie in the Gaussian peak, with \(\sigma(1/p_{T})\approx 1\%\), and almost 90% have a reconstructed momentum within 20% of the true value. At \(\eta=1.2\) only 60% of tracks remain in the Gaussian peak, and only 80% have \(p_{true}/p_{fit}<1.2\). This effect is dominated by the material traversed rather than the energy of the electron, as is shown in Figure 17 where \(\sim 88\%\) of electrons with \(\eta=0\) have \(p_{true}/p_{fit}<1.2\) at both 10 and 40 GeV.

Figure 16: Fitted \(1/p_{T}\) for global tracks (for different material thicknesses traversed). The dark shading represents tracks with \(p_{true}/p_{fit}>1.2\).

Figure 17: Fitted \(1/p_{T}\) for global tracks (varying \(p_{T}\))

Figure 18 shows the \(\chi^{2}\) values for the inner and outer trackers alone, and for the full tracker, for 10 GeV electrons without pileup. The track segment fits give good individual \(\chi^{2}\) values, since the effect of material within either tracker is small. However the combined fit has a long tail to high \(\chi^{2}\) showing that the momenta reconstructed in the two trackers are not always compatible due to bremsstrahlung. It is not reasonable to avoid using a \(\chi^{2}\) cut on the global tracks, since without it one would expect background from fake tracks at high luminosity (in particular from conversions in the outer tracker matched to pileup in the inner tracker). A special procedure to account for bremsstrahlung energy loss is therefore implemented (see the following section). It should be noted that pileup has very little influence on the electron sample, since the outer track segment is rarely effected, and retaining the best \(\chi^{2}\) match is essentially always the correct choice. None of the cases of electrons with wrong momentum can be attributed to incorrect assignment of pileup hits.

Figure 18: \(\chi^{2}\) distributions for the SITV and SIT individually (top) and global tracks (bottom) – note : the last bin includes the overflow.

### Electron track fit with correction for bremsstrahlung energy loss

Figure 19 shows the track-calorimeter match in the \(\tau\phi\) plane as a function of \(1/p_{T}\) of the fitted track, for electrons of 10 GeV (upper plot) and 40 GeV (lower plot). A clear correlation is seen, indicating that the effect of bremsstrahlung can be measured and in principle corrected, using this information. This was implemented in an improved track fit, to be used only for electron candidates.

The bremsstrahlung spectrum is peaked at low energies and bremsstrahlung is most likely to occur in the regions of highest density. In our case, this means that bremsstrahlung is most likely at the tracking layers, and relatively improbable between them. Given that the total thickness of the detector is much less than a radiation length, the most likely cause of a spoilt electron momentum is the loss of a single bremsstrahlung photon at one of the tracking layers. Double bremsstrahlung, and cases where the bremsstrahlung photon converts and is detected by the tracker are second order effects which are not considered.

Figure 19: Track–calorimeter position matchThe bremsstrahlung fit has 6 parameters, 5 for the normal helix, and 1 for the energy loss at a 'kink' where the hard bremsstrahlung occurs. The energy of this bremsstrahlung is constrained using the correlation with the calorimeter impact position (see above) taking its error into account. The normal fit (with no bremsstrahlung) is tried first, followed by a bremsstrahlung fit in which the bremsstrahlung position is tried at the position of each tracking layer in turn. The solution with the best \(\chi^{2}\) is retained. This procedure removes almost completely the high \(\chi^{2}\) tail which was seen in the helix fit, with very little loss of efficiency when using a cutoff at \(\chi^{2}=5.0\) per degree of freedom. Second order effects, such as multiple hard bremsstrahlung or bremsstrahlung followed by a conversion, remain as the main sources of incorrect momenta. Figure 20 shows the distribution of \(E/p\) for 10 GeV electrons at \(\eta=1.2\), using the normal helix fit (top plots) and the bremsstrahlung fit (lower plots). The effect of pileup is included. The almost complete removal of the bremsstrahlung tail can be clearly seen. The right hand plots show the efficiency of an \(E/p\) cut. For a cut at 1.3 the efficiency improves from 90% with the helix fit to \(>99\%\) with the bremsstrahlung fit. Without pileup \(\sim 99\%\) efficiency is obtained for \(E/p<1.2\).

Electron Identification

### Partner search

A high rejection against charged hadron backgrounds is expected from the fine grained Ascot-Eagle calorimetry alone. The requirements of an associated charged track (especially given the accurate calorimeter position resolution), and an energy-momentum match, will essentially restrict this background to isolated single high \(p_{T}\) hadrons with an early charge exchange interaction. The presence of a preshower detector further limits the available interaction length for this background. Rejection against neutral hadron backgrounds is more difficult, as an isolated \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) decay gives a similar signal to an electron in the calorimeter (and preshower). Associated charged tracks arise from electron pairs produced by Dalitz decays and by \(\gamma\) conversions. The leading track in sufficiently asymmetric electron pairs will also satisfy the E/p matching, so to obtain additional rejection power it is neccessary to search for the lower energy partner electron.

However a simple cut on the presence of a low energy opposite signed track in the vicinity of an electron candidate leads to a substantial reduction in electron identification efficiency from pileup background. Section 5.2 indicates that there would be a loss of \(10-30\%\) from pileup segments in the inner tracker with \(p_{T}>E_{T(\mathrm{e}alo)}/4\). Obviously track finding at lower \(p_{T}\) values is required for an efficient asymmetric pair veto. Therefore a special fit procedure has been adopted, where the partner is required to be co-linear to the electron candidate at either the vertex, beam pipe or first tracking layer, with a direction that has zero transverse impact parameter at the beam axis. The partner is also required to be found in both inner and outer trackers using a modified version of the pattern recognition outlined in sections 5.2 and 5.3. The trigger road (section 5.1) gives an implicit cutoff for \(p_{T}\lesssim 2\) GeV. The electron fit algorithm is not valid for electron pairs, so a helix fit was used for both track candidates with a \(\chi^{2}\) cutoff to suppress pileup. Thus the high \(\chi^{2}\) tail caused by bremsstrahlung limits the efficiency of this partner fit procedure. A tight \(\chi^{2}\) cut was chosen to minimize single electron losses, a looser cut would give better rejection against electron pairs at the cost of some loss of single electron efficiency.

### Electron identification criteria

The following criteria were applied to the tracking system and calorimeter to define an electron and to suppress the main backgrounds which would otherwise fake the electron signature :

* **electromagnetic calorimeter cluster:** require an electromagnetic cluster trigger in an \(\eta\times\phi\) window of \(3\times 7\) cells up to 30 GeV, \(5\times 7\) cells up to 90 GeV and \(7\times 7\) cells for higher energies.
* **calorimeter isolation:** require less than 1.5 GeV transverse energy in a rim around the calorimeter matrix.
* **track:** require a global track with a satisfactory electron fit associated to the calorimeter cluster (fit \(\chi^{2}<5.0\) per degree of freedom); inner and outer track segments individually satisfying a helix fit including the transverse vertex and calorimeter \(\eta\) position, with \(p_{T}>E_{T(\mathrm{e}alo)}/4\) and \(\chi^{2}<5.0\) per degree of freedom. In addition \(\geq 3/4\) hits including an obligatory hit in the first layer are required in the inner tracker, \(\geq 5/6\)hits are required in the outer tracker.
* **E/p matching:** require a match between the momentum reconstructed in the tracking system and the energy measured in the calorimeter. In particular we asked for \(0.90<E/p<1.3\) for a parent particle with \(p_{T}\)\(\leq 20\) GeV, with the upper bound increasing linearly to 2.0 at 100 GeV.
* **electron pair veto:** veto triggers which contain either a positive and a negative track with satisfactory electron fits, or any track satisfying the partner fit as explained in section 6.1.

### Electron finding efficiency

Table 1 summarises the tracking efficiencies achieved for single electrons in the centre of the barrel (\(\eta=0\)) and at the end of the barrel (\(\eta=1.2\)), with the inefficiency broken down into contributions from bremsstrahlung effects, layer efficiency and pileup. The innermost (r = 10 cm) layer is assumed to be 99% efficient, all other layers 98%. The quoted efficiencies are rounded to the nearest 0.5%.

Ambiguous track segments are found in the outer tracker for up to 4% of electrons. These are caused by early shower development rather than pileup background, i.e. a hard bremsstrahlung followed by the bremsstrahlung photon converting. Of course this photon is not deflected by the magnetic field, and generally its trajectory is sufficiently long for the conversion track segment to be well seperated from the 'ideal helix' impact given by the calorimeter cluster centroid. This seperation is in the opposite direction to that expected from bremsstrahlung, thus most of these outer tracker ambiguities fail to give an acceptable electron fit \(\chi^{2}\). For the 10, 20 and 40 GeV data samples, ambiguous electron fits are found for \(\sim 0.2\%\) of electrons at \(\eta=0\) and \(\sim 0.3\%\) at \(\eta=1.2\). In some cases the bremsstrahlung is sufficiently hard for the primary electron to be swept from the trigger road by the magnetic field. This gives rise to a unique track with an artificially high fitted \(p_{T}\), occasionally with a wrong sign of charge. The rate of wrong sign fits is \(\sim 0.02\%\) for these data samples. At \(p_{T}\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\raise 2.1973pt\hbox{$>$}}{\lower 2.1973pt\hbox{$ \sim$}}}80\) GeV there is a sharp increase in the ambiguity rate as the magnetic deflection decreases to be compatible with the calorimeter position resolution, with \(\sim 2\%\) ambiguities for 100 GeV electrons at \(\eta=0\) and \(\sim 3\%\) at \(\eta=1.2\), increasing to 4% in the high energy limit. The rate of wrong sign solutions also increases

Table 1: Track finding efficiency to 1-2% causing an electron identification inefficiency, because the event is misclassified as an electron pair since the wrong sign solution is accompanied by the correct electron fit. With the improved position resolution of the accordion calorimeter the threshold for the increase in ambiguity rate is expected to be \(\sim 300\) GeV. Some additional rejection against ambiguities and wrong sign solutions caused by conversions could be obtained from a pulse height analysis in the outer tracker.

Table 2 summarises the efficiencies for the electron identification criteria, itemizing the inefficiencies from the calorimeter cluster algorithm and isolation cut, track finding, E/p matching and electron pair veto. These efficiencies are clearly acceptable.

Because the rate of 'fake' electrons from pileup is so low in the outer tracker, it will be very efficient as a photon detector - used to veto real electrons. The 2-3% electron inefficiency will then translate into the rate of 'fake' photons. As it stands, this is unacceptably high for vetoing 'fake' \(\gamma\gamma\) from misidentified \(Z\to e^{+}\,e^{-}\) in a Higgs search, but as the main loss of efficiency comes from the \(E_{T(calo)}/4\) cut, the pattern recognition could easily be modified for a special photon filter.

## 7 Rejection of \(\gamma\) Conversions and \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) Dalitz Decays

### Electron and background rates

Electron pairs caused by the conversion of a high energy photon or by a \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) Dalitz decay are expected to be a large source of background to the detection of single electron signatures in the LHC environment, and to be one of the most difficult to remove. As has been shown in previous studies [4], the rate of isolated \(\pi^{0}\) exceeds the rate of prompt electrons from \(b\) and \(W\) decays by a factor of \(\approx 10^{2}\). For the analysis of single electron decay processes, this background should be reduced to below \(\sim 10\%\) of the prompt electron rate.

The following decay channels for neutral mesons have been considered:

* production of conversion electrons by photons from the processes \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) \(\eta\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) \(\eta\to 3\pi^{0}\to 6\gamma\) and direct photons
* \(\pi^{0}\) Dalitz decays \(\pi^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\gamma\)
* Dalitz decays of the \(\eta\) meson: \(\eta\to e^{+}e^{-}\gamma\) \(\eta\to 3\pi^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}+5\gamma\) The production ratio of \(\pi^{0}\) and \(\eta\) mesons has been measured at the ISR and at the CERN \(p\bar{p}\) Collider to be 0.55 [5] and the production rate of direct photons is set to 6% of the \(\pi^{0}\) rate. Table 3 gives the relative weight for each of these processes. The conversion rate, of course, depends on the total amount of material traversed by the parent particle, thus the photon weights should be multiplied by the conversion probability to obtain the rate of electron pair production (this is discussed in section 7.2).

Dalitz decays are a particularly dangerous source of background since the energy is shared asymmetrically between the two electrons. The simulation is performed using

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline particle & production & decay mode & branching & total weight \\  & rate (\(\pi^{0}=1\)) & & ratio & (norm. to \(\pi^{0}\) rate) \\ \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{photon production} \\ \hline \(\pi^{0}\) & 1 & \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) & 98.8\% & 1.98 \\ \(\eta\) & 0.55 & \(\eta\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) & 38.9\% & 0.43 \\  & & \(\eta\to 3\pi^{0}\to 6\gamma\) & 30.8\% & 1.02 \\ \(\gamma\) & 0.06 & (direct) & 1 & 0.06 \\ \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{total 348.0\%} \\ \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{Dalitz decays} \\ \hline \(\pi^{0}\) & 1 & \(\pi^{0}\to e^{+}e^{-}\gamma\) & 1.2\% & 0.012 \\ \(\eta\) & 0.55 & \(\eta\to e^{+}e^{-}\gamma\) & 0.5\% & 0.003 \\  & & \(\eta\to 3\pi^{0}\) & 1.15\% & 0.006 \\  & & \(\to e^{+}e^{-}+5\gamma\) & & \\ \hline \end{tabular}

a special interface [6] to the SLUG/GEANT/DICE package to produce events weighted according to Table 3 and with the correct Dalitz matrix element [7].

15000 events were generated for each conversion dataset and 12000 events for each Dalitz decay dataset from \(p_{T}\) thresholds of 10 GeV, 20 GeV, 40 GeV and 80 GeV, using a \(p_{T}\) spectrum \(d\sigma/dp_{T}=p_{T}^{-5.5}\)[4]. The results of this study are shown in Figure 23 : where the solid line is the generated \(\pi^{0}/\eta^{0}\)\(p_{T}\) spectrum, the lightly shaded region corresponds to an electron candidate (i.e. with an associated global track passing the electron fit), and the darkly shaded region is the 'fake' electron rate (i.e. when all the electron identification criteria of section 6.2 are satisfied). The transverse energy of these electrons is assigned from the calorimeter measurement, obtained according to section 4.2, as this is more precise than the \(p_{T}\) measured by the tracking detectors. It can be seen that an overall rejection of \(\sim 10^{3}\) is obtained across the generated \(p_{T}\) range. More details on the rejection against \(\gamma\) conversions are given in section 7.2 and against Dalitz decays in section 7.3.

Figure 23: Generated \(E_{T}\) distribution of \(\pi^{0}/\eta\)’s (solid line). The light shading shows the calorimeter measured \(E_{T}\) for calorimeter clusters with an associated track passing the electron fit. The dark shading represents ‘fake’ electrons - tracks passing E/p and e-pair cuts.

The results are also presented as an integral distribution in Figure 24 where the 'fake' electron rate can be compared to the production of electrons from W decay. From this source alone, the goal of \(\mathrel{\hbox to 0.0pt{\lower 4.0pt\hbox{ $\sim$}}\raise 1.0pt\hbox{$<$}}10\%\) 'fake' electrons is achieved for \(p_{T}>30\) GeV. It should be noted that the generated \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) cross-section corresponds to the entire expected electromagnetic level 1 trigger rate from the calorimeter [8], and is even a little too high for \(p_{T}>80\) GeV. The pessimistic assumption that all of these triggers come from single \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) production may lead to an overestimate of the 'fake' electron rate, as the E/p rejection against multi \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) is expected to be significantly larger.

Figure 24: Integral \(E_{T}\) distribution of \(\pi^{0}/\eta\)’s. The rate of isolated electrons from \(W\to e\nu\) is also shown. The light shading shows the rate of electron candidates and the dark shading that of ‘fake’ electrons.

### Rejection against \(\gamma\) conversions

It is clear from the relative weights for conversions and Dalitz decays in Table 3 that conversions are likely to be the dominant background, and that the available conversion length should be kept to a minimum. For this latter reason the track finding algorithm requires an obligatory hit in the first layer. For a silicon detector this layer will be \(\sim 1\%\)\(X_{0}\) thick, including material for mechanical support and electronic read-out. This passive material should be placed outside the active silicon, then only conversions in the first \(\sim 200\)\(\mu\)m of silicon will register a hit. To simplify the GEANT simulations the active and passive materials were clumped together into a homogeneous active silicon layer with \(1\%\)\(X_{0}\) thickness, thus the rate of conversions registering a hit in the first layer are overestimated by a factor \(\sim 5\). The beam pipe is another unavoidable source of conversion background, a reasonable thickness is \(\sim 1\) mm of beryllium as used at the SPS collider. In order to provide consistency with the first tracking layer, a beryllium thickness of 5 mm was used in the simulations, then the observed background conversion rates have been divided by 5. An advantage of this procedure is to retain statistical precision whilst reducing the substantial computer time requirements by a factor 5. The corrected thickness is thus 0.5% \(X_{0}\) for conversion backgrounds.

To understand the available rejection we look at the effect of each of the electron-defining cuts on the sample of conversions. A simple phase-space calculation indicates that about 65% of \(\eta\) or \(\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\,\gamma\) with external \(\gamma\) conversion have at least one electron above the \(E_{T(ealo)}/4\) track finding requirement, thus demanding a track associated to the calorimeter cluster should give a rejection of \(1/(0.65\times 2\times\frac{7}{9}\times 0.005)\approx 200\). In Figure 25 it can be seen that this rejection was obtained, and that the rejection increased by a further factor \(\sim 4\) at low energies for reasons explained below.

The contribution of the calorimeter rejection is small - falling from a modest \(\sim 1.3\) at 12 GeV to become negligible above 40 GeV. This is a consequence of the calorimeter cluster algorithm, which was chosen to keep real electrons even when accompanied by distinct bremsstrahlung photons - naturally it cannot distinguish these from close multi-photons and electron pairs. Although the magnetic field opens electron pairs, such that in the low \(p_{T}\) limit the electrons are no longer associated to the triggering calorimeter cluster, in practice the \(E_{T(ealo)}/4\) requirement limits this effect to parent \(\pi^{0}\)'s below 20 GeV. More frequently only one electron is deflected away, and this missing energy gives rise to a feed-down effect, where the small energy difference is amplified by the steeply falling parent \(p_{T}\) distribution. These contributions correspond to the lightly shaded region on Figure 25.

The dominant energy dependent effect influencing the rejection obtained from requiring a charged track - calorimeter match comes from the track fit \(\chi^{2}\), since the finite distance traversed as a straight line up to the conversion point leads to a measureable impact parameter at the beam axis for a trajectory defined by the inner and outer track vectors. Figure 25 shows this to increase the rejection by a factor \(\sim 3\) at \(p_{T}=12\) GeV.

Figure 25: The rejection obtained against external \(\gamma\) conversions by requiring a track–calorimeter association is shown as a function of the generated \(\pi^{0}/\eta\)\(E_{T}\).

The magnetic field tends to deflect the leading conversion electron away from the calorimeter cluster centroid, this offset imitates an isolated electron with a hard bremsstrahlung. The special electron track fit then distorts the E/p distribution as illustrated in Figure 26. A helix fit gives the track momentum distribution lying essentially between \(E_{T(\mathrm{e}alo)}/4\) and \(E_{T(\mathrm{e}alo)}\) as expected from the track finding requirement, but the electron fit bremsstrahlung correction leads to an E/p distribution much more symmetric about 1.0.

Figure 26: E/p distribution for the leading electron from \(\gamma\) conversion obtained using a helix track-fit (top), and with the special electron track-fit (bottom).

An additional rejection factor of \(\sim 2\) is obtained from the E/p cut as can be seen from Figure 27.

The partner search becomes more effective with increasing energy. This is to be expected since the sensitivity of the fit \(\chi^{2}\) to a given bremsstrahlung loss is falling in inverse proportion to \(p_{T}\). Also the lower cutoff at 2 GeV becomes less important. The overall rejection is \(\sim 1500\) and approximately energy independent for parent \(p_{T}\) between 10 and 80 GeV. Above 80 GeV the relatively imprecise calorimeter position resolution (with respect to the accordion) significantly reduces the rejection obtained from E/p.

Figure 27: The rejection obtained against external \(\gamma\) conversions with shaded regions representing the contributions from track–calorimeter matching, E/p balance and partner and electron pair vetoes.

### Rejection against Dalitz decays

The contributions of the different cuts to Dalitz pair rejection have also been investigated, see Figure 28. The overall rejection is \(\sim 14\) for energies up to 80 GeV. As for the conversions, the declining power of the E/p cut reduces the rejection at higher energies.

From Table 3 the ratio of the conversion and Dalitz weights is 165, whereas the rejections are in the ratio \(\sim 1500/\sim 14\approx 110\). Thus Dalitz pairs represent about 40% of the 'fake' electrons arising from \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) decay.
