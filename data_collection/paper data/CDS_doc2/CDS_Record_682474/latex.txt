We analyze the constraints on the new possible high energy interactions between

fermions and vector bosons or bosons themselves in almost all available experimental

data. The most restrictive limitations obtained from polarized experiments are not

very large and correspond to the mass scale of order 200 GeV. ATLAS will rise up this

limit seriously.

The Standard Model (SM) of electroweak and strong interactions is in excellent agreement with almost all modern experimental results [1]. But some unpleasant peculiarities of the SM show that it is not a fundamental theory in its ultimate form. Prevailing opinion exists among working in this branch of research about only model character of the SM. The challenging problems of the SM are the spectrum of leptons and quarks, mass generation, large number of arbitrary parameters (about 20), \(CP\)-violation origin, unnaturalness of the Higgs sector and so on. Their solutions are possible in the compositness framework with natural explanation in a simple underlying substructure. Leptons and quarks could be composite structures, bound states of some more fundamental constituents.

Last years give us many examples of rather interesting structural models of all modern fundamental particles including intermediate vector bosons and Higgs bosons. But so far no one has made off an attractive composite model or has received any experimental evidences of compositenes except perhaps the CDF result about an excess above the QCD predictions the data on inclusive jet cross section for transversal energy jet at more than 200 GeV.

Moreover, very serious theoretical difficulty of such models is huge diversity of scales set by the masses of particles, which range from 0.5 MeV to 180 GeV; and by the mass of compositeness (scale about 1 TeV). It may be that this peculiar feature is connected with special symmetry properties of the interaction, which binds the appropriate constituents. These properties can be the chiral symmetry or supersymmetry. But in any case there is no satisfactory model for producing mass spectrums of leptons and quarks.

This lack of a predictive composite model with the phenomenological necessity for searching such structures provides not popular but very appealing directions of going outside the SM. By the way this means that experiment has to be done in a very broad spectrum of possibilities by using large variety of different processes. It is probable that the structure of interactions will be very unusual and its nature will show up itself only in comparison of many different processes. So, search for a substructure will be an important theoretical and phenomenological topic.

One way of experimental data analysis in terms of a substructure includes their parameterization by general form of four fermion interactions. It implicitly contains certain physical assumption about new physics. Therefore, it is useful to have different parameterization of the new physics which also has proper physical basis.

It is known that all usual composite systems reveal their structure through the presence of induced terms in matrix elements of different currents. We can use these induced terms as a low energy parameterization which takes into account the Lorentz invariant low energy structure of the SM and gives well defined and measurable deviations from the SM predictions.

We shall realize this general program for spin 1/2 and 1 particles which are the pointlike and fundamental ones in the SM. The same game we could play with the fundamental scalar particle of the SM, the Higgs boson. But up to now there is no experimental evidence about its existence. So it will be useful for the future analysis of the Higgs properties after its experimental discovery.

Our aim is to study effects of some induced terms in matrix elements for the currents of spin 1/2 and 1 particles. We start from the analysis of spin 1/2 particles, supposing the existence of new interactions between charged fermions and neutral bosons. It is phenomenologically convenient to express various deviations from the SM by the general form of the fermion-boson interaction. Here we use the gauge-invariant parameterization, which is different from the more standard ones, such as parameterization in terms of the extra four-fermion interaction. The vertex corresponding to the interaction between the neutral vector boson \(V_{\nu}\) and spin \(1/2\) particle \(f\) in the momentum space has the form:

\[\Gamma_{\nu}=Q\gamma_{\nu}+\mu\sigma_{\nu\rho}q_{\rho}+\ae(q^{2}\delta_{\nu\rho}- q_{\nu}q_{\rho})\gamma_{\rho}\gamma_{5}+d\sigma_{\nu\rho}\gamma_{5}q_{\rho}, \tag{1}\]

where \(Q\), \(\mu\) and \(d\) characterize, respectively, the charge, the anomalous magnetic and dipole electric moments of the fermion distribution; the term with the coefficient \(\ae\) represents the anapole interaction; \(\gamma_{\mu}\), \(\sigma_{\nu\rho}=\frac{i}{2}[\gamma_{\nu}\gamma_{\rho}-\gamma_{\rho}\gamma_{\nu}]\), \(\gamma_{5}=\gamma_{1}\gamma_{2}\gamma_{3}\gamma_{4}\), \(\gamma_{\mu}\) are the Dirac matrices, \(q\) is the momentum transfer.

The second and forth terms determine well known properties, such as anomalous magnetic and electric dipole interactions. The third term is a rather unpopular one. It gives the anapole interaction, first introduced in Ref. [2]. In nonrelativistic approximation the term with \(\mu\) produces \(\mu\vec{H}\vec{\sigma}\) interaction (magnetic field \(\vec{H}\) and spin vector \(\vec{\sigma}\)) and the term with \(\ae\) brings to the \(\ae\vec{\sigma}\)rot\(\vec{H}\) or spin-current interaction \(\ae\vec{\sigma}\vec{J}\). In the SM, \(\mu\propto\alpha/\pi+\dots\) (terms of higher order in \(\alpha\)), and there is an exact expression for the \(\mu\) up to \((\alpha/\pi)^{3}\) terms. But this do not take place for the anapole interaction. There were several attempts to calculate anapole moments of different particles [3], but the results are ambiguous. (It is caused by the fact that the anapole moment characterizes interaction with a virtual photon and vanishes in the case of the real \(\gamma\), but all calculation methods take the case of a real particles as the reference point.) Therefore, we use only a rough estimation of its value according to [2]: \(\ae\propto\alpha G\), where \(\alpha\) is the fine structure constant and \(G\) is the Fermi weak coupling constant. In any case, here we are interesting in phenomenological estimation of the \(\ae\) from different experiments, taking into account the SM predictions.

Earlier estimations for the lepton anapole interaction were made under assumption that all deviations from the QED predictions are determined by this interaction [4]. But the existing experimental data point on the main role of the electroweak mechanism in tree approximation. So, we are to consider the new anapole interaction only as correction to the SM in the low energy range. The next point is the energy range where we have to search for it. At low energy the anapole interaction is suppressed by its 'virtual' character. At high energy (close to the mass of standard \(Z^{0}\)-boson) it is hidden by effects of the neutral current. Therefore, we have to consider the intermediate energy.

Leptonic reactions are free from the strong interaction ambiguities. So we have the simple SM Lagrangian for description of interaction of the fermion field \(f\) with the electromagnetic \(A_{\mu}\) and neutral massive \(Z_{\mu}\) fields:

\[{\cal L}=ie[Q_{f}A_{\nu}\bar{f}\gamma_{\nu}f+\omega_{f}Z_{\nu}\bar{f}\gamma_{ \nu}(\eta_{f}+\gamma_{5})f]. \tag{2}\]

Here \(\bar{f}=f^{+}\gamma_{4}\) (\({}^{+}\) denotes the Hermitian conjugation of the wave function), \(\omega_{f}=(g/e)g_{A}^{f}\), \(\eta_{f}=g_{V}^{f}/g_{A}^{f}\), where \(g\) is the \(SU(2)\) coupling constant, \(g_{V}^{f}\) (\(g_{A}^{f}\)) is the vector (axial vector) coupling constant. As usual, the SM assumes universality of the fermion coupling constants with \(\eta_{t}=1-4\sin^{2}\vartheta_{W}\) ( \(\eta_{u}=1-(8/3)\sin^{2}\vartheta_{W}\), \(\eta_{d}=1-(4/3)\sin^{2}\vartheta_{W}\) ), \(\omega=(2\sin 2\vartheta_{W})^{-1}=-\omega_{t}=\omega_{u}=-\omega_{d}\) and \(\alpha=e^{2}/4\pi\).

The Lagrangian (2) with the phenomenological parameter \(\sin\vartheta_{W}\) (\(\vartheta_{W}\) is the Weinberg's angle) forms the basis of the renormalizable theory. In our phenomenological approach, all additional contributions (interactions beyond the SM) are parameterized by the fermionic constants \(\ae_{f}\). The term \(q_{\mu}\gamma_{\mu}\gamma_{5}\) in (1) is proportional to \(m_{f}\). It is negligible at energies higher than \(m_{f}\), so the tensor structure of the anapole interaction is simplified:

\[\Gamma_{\nu}=\gamma_{\nu}(\nu_{f}+a_{f}\gamma_{5}). \tag{3}\]Now the anapole interaction is hidden in \(a_{f}^{7,Z}\), which is equal to \(a_{f}^{7,Z}+q^{2}a_{f}^{7,Z}\). In the SM, the coupling constants have the form: \(v_{f}^{7}=Q_{f}^{em}\), \(a_{f}^{7}=0\); \(v_{f}^{Z}=\eta_{f}\omega_{f}\), \(a_{f}^{2}=\omega_{f}\). Later we shall use the dimensionless anapole constant \(r_{f}\) defined as

\[a_{f}=[G/8\pi\sqrt{2}]r_{f}=[\alpha\omega^{2}/M_{Z}^{2}]r_{f}.\]

If one does not want to use the electroweak scale \(G\), then the parameter may be expressed in terms of the new energy scale \(\Lambda\): \(a_{f}=1/\Lambda^{2}\), where the new interaction manifests itself.

Now let us consider the reaction \(e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) at high energy when all masses are smaller than the energy. That condition means that all results will be also valid for \(e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) far from the threshold. We can describe this process by two diagrams with \(\gamma\)- and \(Z\)- exchange in \(s\)-channel with the modification of electromagnetic vertex according to (3). If we take into account the \(e-\mu\)- universality for the anapole interaction, we find the differential cross section:

\[\frac{d\sigma(e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})}{d\cos\theta }=\frac{\pi\alpha^{2}}{2s}[F(1+\cos^{2}\theta)+2F_{a}\cos\theta], \tag{4}\] \[F = (1+s^{2}ae^{2})^{2}+2(\eta+sae)^{2}\mbox{Re}\chi+(1+\eta^{2})^{2 }|\chi|^{2},\] (5) \[F_{a} = 4s^{2}ae^{2}+2(1+\eta sae)^{2}\mbox{Re}\chi+4\eta^{2}\mid\chi \mid^{2};\qquad\chi=\omega^{2}s/(s-M_{z}^{2}+i\Gamma_{z}M_{z}),\]

where \(M_{Z}\) and \(\Gamma_{Z}\) are mass and width of the \(Z^{0}\)-boson; the squared energy is denoted as \(s=-q^{2}\), \(\theta\) is the angle between \(e^{+}\) and \(\mu^{+}\) in the c.m.s.. Symmetric \(F\) and antisymmetric \(F_{a}\) parts of the cross section (4) have terms linear on \(ae\) but with a small factor \(\eta_{\ell}\). It is evident that in the "pure" QED we obtain \(F=1\) and \(F_{a}=0\). For QED with anapole interaction (but without usual weak interaction) the expressions (5) are \(F=(1+s^{2}ae^{2})^{2}\) and \(F_{a}=4s^{2}ae^{2}\). The equations (5) show that the anapole interaction contributions grow with energy in the region where the formfactor suppression is absent.

With the notation \(c\) for the cosine of maximal measurable angle, (\(-c<\cos\theta<c\)) the total cross section \(\sigma\) and the forward-backward asymmetry \(A_{FB}\) are

\[\sigma(e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=\frac{4\pi}{3}\frac{ \alpha^{2}}{4s}Fc(3+c^{2})\stackrel{{ c\to 1}}{{\longrightarrow}}\frac{4\pi}{3} \frac{\alpha^{2}}{s}F, \tag{6}\] \[A_{FB}=\frac{\sigma(\cos\theta>0)-\sigma(\cos\theta<0)}{\sigma( \cos\theta>0)+\sigma(\cos\theta<0)}=\frac{F_{a}}{F}\frac{3c}{3+c^{2}} \stackrel{{ c\to 1}}{{\longrightarrow}}\frac{3}{4}\frac{F_{a}}{F}, \tag{7}\]

where the limit \(c\to 1\) denotes the case of the ideal \(4\pi\)-geometry detector. The value of the cross section is determined by linear and square effects of the anapole interaction in addition to the usual \(\gamma\)-exchange terms. The asymmetry has contributions from interference of the \(\gamma\)- and \(Z\)- exchange diagrams and the anapole interaction. The strong dependence of the anapole contribution on energy points to the high energy data as the best source for the estimation of the anapole parameters \(a_{\ell}\) and \(r_{\ell}\).

For this purpose let us use experimental data about the ratio of the total cross section and the electromagnetic one for \(e^{+}e^{-}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) reaction with \(s\approx 2108GeV^{2}\). The deviation of \(F\) from unity, which does not exceed \(0.09\) (one standard error) [7], may be caused by the anapole interaction with \(r_{\ell}\simeq 330\) (or \(\Lambda_{\ell}>96GeV\)). Data for asymmetry in this reaction were given for energy \(s\simeq 1800GeV^{2}\). The standard error value \(6\%\) means \(r_{\ell}\simeq 260\) (\(\Lambda_{\ell}>108GeV\)). So the agreement between the electroweak theory predictions and experiments gives the restriction for the anapole constant: \(r_{\ell}^{7}\leq 260\) (\(\Lambda_{\ell}^{7}>110GeV\)).

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:6]

In the case of scattering on the isoscalar target, the distribution functions of quarks are cancelled. Therefore the results of such experiments may be interpreted in a more model independent way. The polarization asymmetry \(R_{1}\) (11) characterizes the parity nonconservation. It was measured in the SLAC experiment [9]. The second one \(R_{2}\) (12) was found by the NA4 group from CERN [10]. The difficulties in preparing identically polarized beams of leptons and antileptons prevent from measurement of the \(R_{3}\) asymmetry (13).

Let us compare the mentioned asymmetries with the experimental ones to obtain some restrictions on the anapole interaction constants for quarks and leptons. In the conditions of the SLAC group experiment for the scattering polarized electron on deuteron the formula (11) takes the form:

\[\frac{R_{1}(l_{R}^{-}-l_{L}^{-})}{|\lambda|q^{2}}=-\frac{2}{5}P\{3(2\eta_{u}+ \eta_{d})+5\alpha r_{e}-g(y)[9\eta_{e}+\alpha(4r_{u}+r_{d})]\}. \tag{14}\]

Experimental data parameterize the same quantity as follows

\[{\cal A}/q^{2}=a_{1}+a_{2}g(y), \tag{15}\]

where \(a_{1}=(-9.7\pm 2.6)\times 10^{-5}\) and \(a_{2}=(4.9\pm 8.1)\times 10^{-5}\) for \(q^{2}\propto 1GeV^{2}\). So, comparing equations (14) and (15) we obtain the restriction \(r_{e}\leq 40\) (\(\Lambda_{e}^{\gamma}>276GeV\)) from the \(a_{1}\) measurement and \(4r_{u}+r_{d}\leq 620\) from error of the \(a_{2}\). In other words, we have \(r_{q}\leq 120\) (\(\Lambda_{q}^{\gamma}>160GeV\)) for \(\ae_{u}=\ae_{d}=\ae_{q}\).

The second polarization asymmetry was measured in the scattering of longitudinally polarized \(\mu\)-mesons on the isoscalar carbon target [10]. It has the general form \(B=a+bg(y)q^{2}\), where \(a=(0.15\pm 0.17)10^{-2}\), \(b=(-0.147\pm 0.037)10^{-3}GeV^{2}\) for \(|\lambda|=0.81\). For this case from (12) we derive corresponding approximation

\[B_{theor}=\frac{R_{2}(l_{R}^{+}-l_{L}^{-})}{g(y)q^{2}}=-\frac{2}{5}P[9+| \lambda|\alpha(4r_{u}+r_{d})]. \tag{16}\]

The one standard error deviation from electroweak value for this quantity takes place at \(4r_{u}+r_{d}=350\). Assuming \(\ae_{u}=\ae_{d}=\ae_{q}\), we obtain \(r_{q}<70\) (\(\Lambda_{q}^{\gamma}>210GeV\)).

We see that restrictions on the anapole interactions from the all considered reactions are comparable. Those restrictions from \(e^{+}e^{-}\)-annihilation are free from ambiguities and model assumptions existing in lepton-hadron scattering. But the restriction on the anapole constant from purely leptonic reactions is not so stringent as from the \(ep\)-reactions. This takes place because of including into consideration the polarization of particles in lepton-hadron reactions. If we take into account such possibilities for \(e^{+}e^{-}\)-reactions, we shall derive better limitation on the lepton anapole too.

Let us turn back to leptonic reactions taking now into account lepton polarizations. The formula for the differential cross section is the same as (4), but the expressions for \(F\) and \(F_{a}\) (5) are changed to

\[F^{\prime}=\frac{1-\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}}{4}F+\frac{\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}}{ 4}F_{p},\qquad F^{\prime}_{a}=\frac{1-\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}}{4}F_{a}+\frac{ \lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}}{4}F_{ap}; \tag{17}\]

\[\begin{array}{c}F=\alpha_{e}^{\gamma\gamma}\alpha_{f}^{\gamma\gamma}+(2{\rm Re }P_{Z})\alpha_{e}^{\gamma*}\alpha_{f}^{\gamma*}+|P_{Z}|^{2}\alpha_{e}^{\gamma *}\alpha_{f}^{zz},\\ F_{p}=\alpha_{e}^{\gamma\gamma}\beta_{f}^{\gamma\gamma}+(2{\rm Re}P_{Z}) \alpha_{e}^{\gamma*}\beta_{f}^{\gamma*}+|P_{Z}|^{2}\alpha_{e}^{\gamma*}\beta_ {f}^{zz},\\ F_{a}=\beta_{e}^{\gamma\gamma}\beta_{f}^{\gamma\gamma}+(2{\rm Re}P_{Z})\beta_{ e}^{\gamma*}\alpha_{f}^{\gamma*}+|P_{Z}|^{2}\beta_{e}^{\gamma*}\beta_{f}^{zz},\\ F_{ap}=\beta_{e}^{\gamma*}\alpha_{f}^{\gamma\gamma}+(2{\rm Re}P_{Z})\beta_{e}^{ \gamma*}\alpha_{f}^{\gamma*}+|P_{Z}|^{2}\beta_{e}^{\gamma*}\alpha_{f}^{zz}, \end{array} \tag{18}\]where functions \(\alpha_{f}^{Y^{\prime}V}=v_{f}^{V^{\prime}}v_{f}^{Y}+a_{f}^{Y^{\prime}}a_{f}^{Y}\) and \(\beta_{f}^{Y^{\prime}V}=a_{f}^{V^{\prime}}v_{f}^{Y}+v_{f}^{Y^{\prime}}a_{f}^{V}\) are constructed from the vector \(v_{f}\) and axial-vector \(a_{f}\) constants of the interaction vertex including vector boson field \(V\) (\(V=\gamma,Z^{0}\)); the \(\lambda_{1}(\lambda_{2})\) is the helicity of the final lepton (antilepton). The main difference between these formulae and the expressions (5) consists in appearance linear on \(\ae\) terms without small \(\eta_{\ell}\) factor. This is more evident when we simplify the (18), assuming \(e-\mu\) - universality and modifying only \(\gamma\)-vertex as in (5):

\[F_{ap}=F_{p}=2[s\ae(1+s^{2}\ae^{2})+(\eta+s\ae)(1+\eta s\ae)\mbox{Re}\chi+\eta(1 +\eta^{2})|\chi|^{2}].\]

It means that the polarization even of a single lepton without antilepton (or vice versa) gives us facility to improve limitation on \(\ae_{f}\). Note that including into consideration other terms of vertex (1) spoils the form (4) for differential cross section, by means of terms proportional to \(\sin\theta\).

The formulae (17) are also valid for the unpolarized initial particles but with the measurement of the final fermion polarization degree. Moreover, the reconstruction of the helicity state of one final fermion allows us to extract much more information. The differential cross section is then the following

\[\frac{d\sigma(\lambda)}{d\cos\theta}=\frac{\pi\alpha^{2}}{4s}\Big{\{}[F+ \lambda F_{p}](1+\cos^{2}\theta)+[F_{a}+\lambda F_{ap}]2\cos\theta\Big{\}}. \tag{19}\]

Now we can analyze data from TRISTAN. In addition to the cross section \(\sigma\) and forward-backward asymmetry \(A_{FB}\) there are measurements of the mean \(\tau\) polarization \(P_{\tau}\) and forward-backward polarization asymmetry \(A_{FB}^{pol}\). These observables are expressed in terms of the theoretical values: \(-P_{\tau}=\frac{F_{\tau}}{F}\) and \(A_{FB}^{pol}=\frac{3}{4}\frac{F_{\pi}}{F}\).

Using TRISTAN value of the mean polarization \(-<P_{\tau}>=0.104\pm 0.175\) at \(\sqrt{s}=58GeV\)[11], we obtain \(r_{\ell}^{\gamma}=50\pm 110\) or \(\Lambda_{\gamma}=(250^{+\infty}_{-140})GeV\). Here we give the value of the anapole interaction with errors, because nothing else in our model can create noticeable axial coupling constant at this energy range. The forward-backward polarization asymmetry \(A_{FB}^{pol}\) is less sensitive to \(r_{\ell}^{\gamma}\) at this energy.

To resume this part of our analysis let us mention first of all that the considered model introduces some kind of unusual structure of the fundamental particles. This interaction introduces modifications in the axial-vector part of fermionic couplings with bosons. All available data give us the strength of the fermion anapole interaction comparable with zero value, however the uncertainty of this value is very large up to now.

Now let us turn to the case of spin 1 particle. The SM Lagrangian has the following form

\[{\cal L}=ie(A_{\rho}+\frac{cos\vartheta_{W}}{sin\vartheta_{W}}Z_{\rho})\{W_{ \mu}^{+}(\partial_{\rho}W_{\mu}^{-})-(\partial_{\rho}W_{\mu}^{+})W_{\mu}^{-}- 2[W_{\mu}^{+}(\partial_{\mu}W_{\rho}^{-})-(\partial_{\mu}W_{\rho}^{+})W_{\mu}^ {-}]\} \tag{20}\]

in the obvious notations. The new Lagrangian with \(C-\) and \(P-\) violation but \(CP-\) conservation is

\[{\cal L}(g_{5})=ie\frac{g_{5}}{M^{2}}V_{\alpha}(\Box\delta_{\alpha\beta}- \partial_{\alpha}\partial_{\beta})\epsilon_{\beta\mu\nu\lambda}[(\partial_{ \lambda}W_{\mu}^{+})W_{\nu}^{-})-W_{\mu}^{+}(\partial_{\alpha}W_{\nu}^{-}], \tag{21}\]

where \(\Box\) is the D'Alembertian, \(\epsilon_{\beta\mu\nu\lambda}\) is the Levi-Civita tensor. (This is only a part of the most general Lorentz invariant Lagrangian, which parameterizes the whole three-bosoninteractions [12].) In the Breit system this Lagrangian gives for matrix element of three-boson vertex the nonrelativistic energy

\[g_{5}\frac{2E}{M^{2}}(\vec{s}{\rm rot}\vec{H}),\]

which corresponds to the energy of the anapole type interaction for vector particle. Of course, this term modifies the cross sections of different processes.

In particular, we have for the reaction \(e^{+}e^{-}\to W^{+}W^{-}\) the differential cross section

\[\frac{d\sigma}{dt}=\frac{d\sigma_{t}}{dt}+\frac{d\sigma_{st}}{dt}+\frac{d \sigma_{s}}{dt}, \tag{22}\]

where \(d\sigma_{t}\) originates from the first diagram with neutrino exchange in \(t\)-channel, \(d\sigma\), represents two other diagrams with neutral vector boson exchange in \(s\)-channel, \(d\sigma_{st}\) gives us interference terms; \(s=-(k_{1}+k_{2})^{2}\), \(t=-(k_{1}+p_{1})^{2}\), \(u=-(k_{1}-p_{2})^{2}\), where \(k_{1}\), \(k_{2}\), \(p_{1}\), \(p_{2}\) are energy-momentum four-vectors for \(e^{-}\), \(e^{+}\), \(W^{-}\), \(W^{+}\); \(M\) and \(M_{Z}\) are masses of the \(W\) and \(Z^{0}\):

\[\frac{d\sigma_{t}}{dt} = \frac{\pi\alpha^{2}}{2s^{2}}\frac{g^{4}}{4e^{4}}\bigg{\{}2\frac{ s}{M^{2}}+2\frac{ut-M^{4}}{s^{2}}\Big{[}\frac{s^{2}}{t^{2}}+\frac{s^{2}}{4M^{4} }\Big{]}\bigg{\}}, \tag{23}\] \[\frac{d\sigma_{st}}{dt} = \frac{\pi\alpha^{2}}{2s^{2}}\frac{g^{2}}{4e^{2}}\bigg{\{}f_{1} \frac{ut-M^{4}}{s^{2}}(4\frac{s}{t}+2\frac{s}{M^{2}}+\frac{s^{2}}{M^{4}})+f_{ 2}[\frac{ut-M^{4}}{s^{2}}-4+2\frac{s}{M^{2}}+4\frac{M^{2}}{t}]\] \[\qquad+f_{5}[4\frac{ut-M^{4}}{tM^{2}}(1-2\frac{s}{M^{2}})+8\frac {s}{M^{2}}-2\frac{s^{2}}{M^{4}}]\bigg{\}},\] \[\frac{d\sigma_{s}}{dt} = \frac{\pi\alpha^{2}}{2s^{2}}\bigg{\{}4\frac{ut-M^{4}}{s^{2}}\Big{[} F_{1}(3-\frac{s}{M^{2}}+\frac{s^{2}}{4M^{4}})+F_{2}\frac{s(s-2M^{2})}{4M^{4}}\] \[\qquad+F_{12}\frac{s(s-2M^{2})}{2M^{4}}+F_{5}(-\frac{s^{3}V^{2}} {2M^{6}})\Big{]}\] \[\qquad+F_{2}\frac{s}{M^{2}}V^{2}+F_{5}\frac{s^{3}}{M^{6}}V^{4}+4 \frac{s^{2}}{M^{4}}\frac{t-M^{2}+s/2}{s}\tilde{F}_{25}V^{2}\bigg{\}},\]

where \(V=(1-4M^{2}/s)^{1/2}\) is the velocity of the final bosons in the center of mass frame. The formfactors appear in the cross section in the following combinations

\[f_{i} = Q_{e}Q_{w}G_{i}^{7}+(1+\eta_{e})\chi G_{i}^{a}; \tag{24}\] \[F_{ij} = Q_{e}^{2}Q_{w}^{2}G_{i}^{7}G_{j}^{7}+Q_{e}Q_{w}\eta_{e}\chi(G_{i }^{7}G_{j}^{a}+G_{i}^{z}G_{j}^{7})+(1+\eta_{e}^{2})\chi^{2}G_{i}^{z}G_{j}^{z}, \qquad F_{i}=F_{ii},\] \[\tilde{F}_{ij} = Q_{e}Q_{w}\chi(G_{i}^{7}G_{j}^{s}+G_{i}^{z}G_{j}^{7})+2\eta_{e} \chi^{2}G_{i}^{z}G_{j}^{z},\]

here \(\chi=\omega_{e}\omega_{w}s/(s-M_{z}^{2})\). These formulae for the case of SM (\(G_{1}^{7}=G_{1}^{z}=1,G_{2}^{7}=G_{2}^{z}=-2\)) are the same which were found earlier [13].

Formulae (23) may be rewritten for the case of initial quarks. For the reaction \(d+\bar{d}\) we have to change the lepton constants by the quarks ones (\(Q_{e}\to Q_{d}\), \(\omega_{e}\rightarrow\omega_{d}\), \(\eta_{e}\rightarrow\eta_{d}\)). For the reaction \(u+\bar{u}\) we have to change the constants but also to change the kinematical variables \(d\sigma_{st}\) and \(d\sigma_{s}\) (\(u\gets t\)).

It is convenient to write out the total cross section as the sum of three terms:

\[\sigma=\sigma_{t}+\sigma_{st}+\sigma_{s}. \tag{25}\]Introducing the suitable notation: \(L=\frac{1}{V}\ln\frac{1+V}{1-V}\) and \(y=s/4M^{2}\) we get:

\[\sigma_{t} = \frac{\pi\alpha^{2}V}{2s}\frac{g^{4}}{4e^{4}}\biggl{\{}-4+\frac{20} {3}y+\frac{4}{3}y^{2}+4\frac{2y-1}{2y}L\biggr{\}}, \tag{26}\] \[\sigma_{st} = \frac{\pi\alpha^{2}V}{2s}\frac{g^{2}}{4e^{2}}\biggl{\{}f_{1}( \frac{1}{y}-\frac{10}{3}-\frac{4}{3}y+\frac{8}{3}y^{2}+\frac{1}{2y}2L)+f_{2}(- 4+\frac{16}{3}y+\frac{8}{3}y^{2}-\frac{2}{y}L)\] \[\qquad+f_{5}(4+8y-2\frac{4y-1}{y}L)\biggr{\}},\] \[\sigma_{s} = \frac{\pi\alpha^{2}V}{2s}\biggl{\{}F_{1}\frac{2}{3}V^{2}(3-4y+4y ^{2})+F_{2}\frac{8}{3}V^{2}y(y+1)+F_{12}\frac{8}{3}V^{2}y(2y-1)\] \[\qquad+F_{5}\frac{128}{3}V^{4}y^{3}\biggr{\}}.\]

The most common restriction on the energy behavior of the formfactors came from the unitary limit for the cross section, i.e. \(\sigma(s)\) must only fall with energy. To simplify the analysis we impose \(G_{i}^{\gamma}=G_{i}^{s}=G_{i}\). Such an assumption may be supported by the structure of the gauge theory, where the vertex of the different bosons may differ only by numerical factors. We will analyze an asymptotical form of the cross section, which imposes limitations on the high energy behavior of the formfactors. We gather coefficients before the every power of \(y(\propto s)\) and put them equal to zero for positive powers of y. The higher order coefficient gives us \(G_{1}+G_{2}+1=0\) (\(\sigma\) does not grow with \(s\)). The demand of falling of the total cross section produces: \(G_{1}=1\) and \(G_{2}=-2\) (these values are the same as the SM dictates). Formfactor \(G_{5}\) must decrease with energy as \(s^{-1}\) or faster. Note, that for the case of falling total cross section with energy the most slowly falling term arises from the \(t\)-channel diagram and has the form \(\frac{1}{s}L\approx\frac{1}{s}\ln\frac{s}{2M}\).

As pointed above, the electrical (\(G_{1}\)) and magnetic (\(G_{2}\)) formfactors are well defined by the asymptotical behavior of the total cross section, and coincide with the values coming from the SM. So, it is more interesting to determine the sensitivity of the considered reaction to the anapole moment \(G_{5}\).

Let us plot the value of the formfactor corresponding to 10% deviation from SM prediction. So we can see possible limitation on the magnitude of the formfactor. The Fig. 1 shows the values of the \(G_{5}\) formfactor causing 10% deviation for three cases: equal formfactors in \(\gamma WW\)- and \(ZWW\)- vertexes \(G_{5}^{\gamma}=G_{5}^{\gamma}=G_{5}\); the formfactor in \(ZWW\)-vertex \(G_{5}^{\gamma}\) (\(G_{5}^{\gamma}=0,G_{5}^{\gamma}\neq 0\)) and zero formfactor in \(\gamma WW\)-vertex \(G_{5}^{\gamma}\) (\(G_{i}^{\gamma}=0,G_{5}^{\gamma}\neq 0\)). At LEP II energy, the 10% deviations will take place for the following values of anapole moment: \(G_{5}=0.23(-0.31)\), \(G_{5}^{\gamma}=0.46(-0.53)\) or \(G_{5}^{\gamma}=0.30(-0.38)\).

The next plot shows the sensitivity of the differential cross section to the \(G_{5}\) formfactor. The energy is fixed and equal to 200 GeV. This picture is given for the case \(G_{5}^{\gamma}=G_{5}^{s}=G_{5}\). The closed area in Fig. 2 corresponds to the 10% decreasing of the cross section and the other area gives the 10% increasing of the cross section. The combination of the positive and negative areas in Fig. 2 is more complicated, but the maximal sensitivity lies at the angle near the 90\({}^{\circ}\). (The value \(G_{5}=0.1\) gives deviation more than 10% from the SM value.)

So, we may state that the reaction \(e^{+}e^{-}\to W^{+}W^{-}\) and the analogous reactions \(pp\) (\(p\bar{p}\)) are promising ones for searching the deviations from the SM prediction caused by this new physics beyond the SM.

The dominant leading-order SM diagrams for the \(VV\) pair production in \(pp\) (\(p\bar{p}\)) collisions contains the \(t\)-channel and the \(u\)-channel diagrams with the quark exchange and the \(s\)-channel diagrams with \(V=\gamma,Z\) or \(W\) being a mediating particle. The later diagram includesFigure 1:

Figure 2:

\(WW\gamma\), \(WWZ\), \(ZZ\gamma\) or \(Z\gamma\gamma\) trilinear couplings. In the \(t\)-channel diagram we have the well-measured couplings between \(W\) bosons and quarks, but there is the \(s\)-channel including the anapole interactions. So we may regard diboson production as the source for testing these peculiar interactions. These interactions enhance the cross sections. The enhancement is large at high boson transversal momentum, where there is the reducing through the SM gauge cancellation. Any deviations from the SM caue the diboson production cross section violates unitarity at some large energy for quark system. So, it is necessary to introduce a formfactor diminishing modification in the form \(G_{\rm s}^{\gamma,Z}=\frac{const}{(1+i/\Lambda_{Z,Z}^{2})^{n}}\), (\(n\geq 1\)).

Studies of the \(WW\), \(WZ\) or \(W\gamma\), \(Z\gamma\) production in \(pp\) (\(p\bar{p}\)) collisions are based and will be based for the ATLAS on \(pp\to e\nu jj,e\bar{e}jj,e\nu\gamma+X\) and \(\ell\bar{\ell}\gamma+X\) events, where \(j\) denotes hadronic jet and \(\ell\) is an electron or muon. In Batavia experiments the SM \(WW\) and \(WZ\) signals take about 1/30-th of the main background. The latter is a single \(W\) or \(Z\) boson production accompanied by initial state radiation. The CDF and D0 detectors also looks for an excess of events with high transverse energy photons (\(E_{T}^{\gamma}\)) well separated from the charged leptons. Summarizing their limits for anomalous interactions and couplings [14] we can state that \((G_{\rm s}^{\gamma,Z})\leq\) few units at \(\Lambda_{Z,W}\simeq 1.5TeV\).

The gauge boson pair production at the ATLAS detector at LHC will have some peculiarities depending upon different sources of background for leptons and photons. Using the result of the study on these problems for the ATLAS [15] we expect that \(|G_{\rm s}^{\gamma,Z}|\sim\) few units of percent.

So the \(pp\) machine and ATLAS will impose the strongest restriction on the boson anapole interaction constant, which will be very close to its value with radiative corrections.. or find this interaction.
