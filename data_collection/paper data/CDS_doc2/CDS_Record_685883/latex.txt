## 1 Introduction

This document summarises the specifications of the Atlas Inner Detector. It contains all the major targets for the detector performance, and the constraints which it must satisfy, both technical and financial. The arguments supporting each specification are given briefly, with references to the original work wherever possible.

This document is intended to be in dependent of the layout finally chosen, and can be used as a guide when layout decisions are being considered. However it is assumed that the final layout will consist of a mixture of continuous and discrete high precision layers, and a few specifications are made on that basis.

It is further assumed that the detector will be operated for as long as possible. In some cases subdetectors may be replaced or discarded after some years of operation. Therefore some specifications are marked as 'low luminosity', meaning that the physics needs can be met with an integrated luminosity of the order of \(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (one year at \(10^{3}\) ), while others are marked 'high luminosity' meaning that the performance is required over the full lifetime of the experiment, taken nominally to be 3 years at \(10^{33}\) followed by 7 years at \(10^{34}\). Unless otherwise stated, all specifications should be taken as high luminosity. This does not imply any plan to reconfigure the detector for high luminosity running, beyond the removal/replacement of dead modules, but rather that the robustness of the detector must be far higher for the 'high luminosity' specifications, so that we can be confident of adequate performance throughout the lifetime of the experiment. Ideally, the full performance of the detector would be maintained throughout its lifetime.

## 2 \(\eta\)-Coverage and Number of Points on Track

**The tracking coverage of the ID has been defined since the Letter of Intent (LoI) [1] to be over the pseudo-rapidity range of \(|\eta|<2.5\).** This is driven by the acceptance for various physics channels, which require the largest possible coverage. However the difficulty of implementing high precision tracking in the high-radiation regions for larger values of \(\eta\), and the diminishing returns, lead to a compromise at this value. A good example is the acceptance for the process

\[H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\]

for a Higgs mass of 120 GeV, normalised to the acceptance for \(|\eta|<3.0\). Only 16% of this acceptance is lost with the proposed coverage, while 40% would be lost if the coverage were reduced to \(|\eta|<2.0\)[2].

The number of precision and continuous points needed on a track is more difficult to quantify. For the precision tracking, a bare minimum of three R\(\phi\) measurements is needed to measure the track curvature. This does not rely on assuming that the primary vertex point is known, since in track finding and fitting there is no guarantee that the track originates at the beam crossing point. Since no layer can expect to achieve 100% efficiency, given technical and geometrical losses, four measurement planes is the practical minimum. At the ID Working Group meeting on the 8th of December 1993, this issue was discussed, and it was agreed to establish a specification of **5 or more precision tracking points over the full pseudo-rapidity range.** This gives a minimum robustness to the precision tracking, especially if some of the inner layers are seriously degraded by radiation damage. This specification applies to R\(\phi\) measurements. The case of z-measurements is a matter of resolution and pattern recognition, and is considered below.

In the case of the continuous tracking, the main arguments are track finding and triggering ability, and to a lesser extent transition radiation performance,which are all improved by more points and more radial space. It is very difficult to maintain the same performance across the barrel/endcap transition region, and, until further studies are performed, a weaker specification is set in this region. The number of fake tracks above a threshold of \({\rm p}_{T}~{}>~{}15~{}{\rm GeV}\), as a function of the inner radius of the barrel TRT, while keeping the outer radius fixed was studied in terms of level-2 track triggering [3]. This is equivalent to reducing the number of continuous measurements. Similar studies [4] were performed for lower \({\rm p}_{T}\)-thresholds both for the barrel and endcap straw trackers. **The specification for the number of continuous tracking points is therefore set to 36 points over \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\), allowed to drop to 25 points in the barrel/endcap transition region and for \(|\eta|\) close to 2.5**.

## 3 Momentum Resolution

Although it is desirable to have as high a momentum resolution as possible, in order to be as sensitive as possible to unexpected signals and to reduce backgrounds as far as practical, it should be borne in mind that the tracker cannot compete with the muon system nor with the electromagnetic calorimeter for lepton energy measurements over most of the accessible momentum range.

At very low momenta (below \(\sim 30~{}{\rm GeV}\)), the inner tracker momentum resolution for muons is limited by multiple scattering in the tracker material itself, and for electrons is also limited by bremsstrahlung tails. The material budget needed for the tracker will therefore define the momentum resolution in this range.

There are some expected physics channels where the momentum resolution at high \({\rm p}_{T}\) may be a limitation. Z' mass measurements will be best performed by the electromagnetic calorimeter (\({\rm Z}^{\prime}~{}\rightarrow~{}{\rm ee}\)), and \({\rm Z}^{\prime}~{}\rightarrow~{}{\rm ee}\) asymmetries are not expected to be a limiting factor, given the presence of two charged leptons of opposite sign [5]. More stringent requirements come from W' signals, where measurement of the charge sign of single electrons is crucial. Such a measurement for \({\rm m}_{W^{\prime}}~{}=~{}2~{}{\rm TeV}\), would require \(\Delta~{}p_{T}/p_{T}~{}<~{}30\%\) at \(p_{T}^{e}\) of 1000 GeV. However the rate of W' production at this mass may be so small that the measurement error will be dominated by statistics. A possible W\({}^{\pm}\)W\({}^{\pm}\) signal from strong symmetry breaking will produce electrons of \({\rm p}_{T}~{}\sim~{}250~{}{\rm GeV}\) for a mass scale of 1 TeV, and has potentially large backgrounds from top decays with mismeasured electron sign. These backgrounds will probably be dominated by pattern recognition errors rather than Gaussian momentum errors, and so do not lead to a strict criterion. In this case the expected rate is extremely low [6]. The background from top decays to same sign lepton pairs from SUSY has also been studied [7], and requires a charge misidentification probability of less than \(10^{-2}\). Based on these considerations, **a specification of \(\Delta p_{T}/p_{T}<30\%\) at \(\mathbf{p}_{T}=500\) GeV**, **for \(|\eta|<2\) is set. This is relaxed to \(\Delta p_{T}/p_{T}<50\%\) at \(\mathbf{p}_{T}=500\) GeV**, **for \(|\eta|=2.5\), since the field integral decreases fast for \(|\eta|~{}>~{}2.0\).**

Given the required momentum resolution, the strength of the B-field and the cavity radius must be set in order to define the needed subdetector measurement accuracies. These were chosen at the LOI Board meeting on the 23rd of June 1992, using a variety of earlier studies [8]. ATLAS does not require a very high B-field to give adequate resolution on lepton momenta. A large B-field implies higher coil cost, more coil material, more loopers in the inner region of the tracker and less powerful track isolation cuts. On the positive side, a large B-field gives better momentum resolution, and therefore possibly higher rejection for E/p cuts for a given spatial resolution, or less channels for the same momentum resolution. Similarly, a large B-field allows a given momentum resolution to be reached in a smaller cavity. **A field of 2T was chosen as a sensible compromise between these requirements.**

The size of the cavity was fixed at the same discussion. The cost of the experiment rises very rapidly with size, and so it is desirable to keep the overall experiment dimensions as small as possible. The electromagnetic calorimeter granularity has a natural scale from the Moliere radius of showers. The choice of LAr as the baseline calorimeter implies that the preshower detector must be inside the cryostat, and use the cryostat wall as part of the radiator, in order to avoid degrading the calorimeter resolution with extra material, as would be the case with a separate preshower and radiator [9]. The use of the cryostat wall and the coil as part of an integrated calorimeter/preshower system gives the lowest additional dead material for the preshower. Energy loss in the coil is corrected by the preshower, and the jet energy resolution and field quality in the tracking volume are not degraded, as would be the case if the coil were to be placed after the electromagnetic calorimeter.

From these considerations, it was agreed to place **the cryostat wall at 115 cm**, with the coil at 123 cm, followed by the cold preshower and electromagnetic calorimeter.

The length of the cavity is then determined by the \(\eta\)-range required. **A length of 6.8m was chosen**, not including the 5 cm thick polythene moderator situated in front of the endcap calorimeter. This means that the last tracking point at a radius of 50 cm is at \(\eta~{}=~{}2.7\), before allowance for vertex smearing.

## 4 z- and \(\theta\)-Resolution

An initial target of 1 mrad angular error was suggested [10], in order to give a mass resolution of \(\sim 1\%\) for Z\({}^{0}\)'s of 300 GeV p\({}_{T}\). This target has not been found to be needed for any expected physics signal.

Other considerations are the K\({}_{S}^{0}\) mass resolution needed for the channel \(B_{d}^{0}\to\psi K_{S}^{0}\), and the mass resolution needed for the B-mesons reconstructed in this channel. The K\({}_{S}^{0}\) mass resolution is less critical than the B-meson mass resolution, which determines the background expected under the peak. This increases from 1 0% to 20% when going from an ideal resolution to a \(\theta\)-resolution of 3 mrad [11]. Similar considerations apply to other B-decays.

The track-shower match precision has also been considered. The calorimeter position resolution is 6mm/\(\sqrt{E}\) in the transverse plane and somewhat worse in the longitudinal one. However, after a cut on E/p, there is little gain in rejection from a cut on track-shower matching, since there is a real high-momentum track impacting the centre of the shower [12].

A further consideration is the resolution required to match tracks to the muon system. A point with a z-resolution of \(<300\mu\)m at any radius inside the calorimeter, where the measurement is not affected by multiple scattering for p\({}_{T}\sim 1\) TeV, should improve the muon resolution somewhat. However, the excellent stand-alone performance of the muon toroids is sufficient for all the physics processes so far considered.

**The initial specification is then set to a \(\theta\)-resolution of 2 mrad.** The requirements on z-resolution for precise vertexing are discussed below.

## 5 Tracking Efficiency and Pattern Recognition

Three distinct classes of charged tracks are considered important for physics at high luminosity and the requirements for these are discussed below. The low luminosity requirements are discussed separately at the end of this section.

The most important class of tracks consists of high-p\({}_{T}\) isolated tracks, which are expected to be leptons from physics signals. High-p\({}_{T}\) is defined in this context as p\({}_{T}\ >\ 5\) GeV. This choice is motivated by the acceptance for the channel \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to 4l\), which depends strongly on the p\({}_{T}\)-cut made on the softest leptons. The significances expected for p\({}_{T}\)-cuts of 5, 7, and 10 GeV as a function of the Higgs mass are given in [13]. For Higgs masses below 130 GeV, the expectedsignal rises rapidly as the p\({}_{T}\)-cut is reduced. Unfortunately, the background rates increase even more rapidly, and the significance is not increased for a cut as low as 5 GeV. Nonetheless, it is desirable to have some margin of safety in the analysis when making such a cut, and there is not expected to be any increased difficulty in meeting specifications in the range studied. **A tracking efficiency of \(>95\%\) over the full \(\eta\)-range is required for all isolated tracks with p\({}_{T}~{}>~{}5\) GeV. Fake track rates should be less than 1% of the signal rates.**

A second class of tracks are those needed for isolation cuts, in order to suppress backgrounds from b-decays to isolated leptons. These were studied in [14], for the intermediate mass Higgs case above. Leptons were rejected if any charged particle with p\({}_{T}~{}>\) 2 GeV was found in a cone of \(\Delta R~{}=~{}\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}~{}+~{}\Delta\phi^{2}}~{}=~{}0.2\) around the lepton direction. Including the effect of pile-up, these cuts gave rejections of 30 (resp. 15) against \(t\bar{t}\) (resp. \(Zb\bar{b}\)) backgrounds, with an efficiency of 50% (resp. 85%) for the Higgs signal and irreducible \(ZZ^{*}\) backgrounds at high (resp. low) luminosity. In order to allow some flexibility for isolation cuts in this and other analyses, a reduced p\({}_{T}\)-threshold is specified at 1 GeV. **It is required to reconstruct all tracks with p\({}_{T}~{}>\) 1 GeV in a cone of \(\Delta\)R \(<~{}0.25\) around high-p\({}_{T}\) isolated track candidates, with an efficiency of \(>~{}90\%\). The probability of a track in this class being a fake should be less than 10% per real track**.

A third class of tracks very similar to the previous one consists of electron partners from photon conversions or \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) Dalitz decays. Although it is hoped that most of these electron pairs will be rejected by the absence of corresponding hits in the very first detector layers, the robustness of the ATLAS electron identification, at high luminosity and for values of p\({}_{T}\) as low as possible, **requires that the inner tracker be able to reconstruct electrons with p\({}_{T}~{}>\) 0.5 GeV near electron candidates with an efficiency (integrated over all p\({}_{T}\)) above 90%.** This specification is more stringent than that used for track isolation since the additional requirement of electron identification using the TR-function can be imposed on the tracks. It has been demonstrated that an additional rejection of \(\sim\) 15 can thus be obtained against these electron pair backgrounds [5, 15]. As noted above, a large number of late conversions can be vetoed if the innermost tracker layers have a high efficiency. This may lead to a specification on the amount of material allowable as a function of radius, coupled to single layer efficiency requirements.

At low luminosity extra track reconstruction requirements are introduced by the ATLAS B-physics goals. Given the broad range of these goals, which demand efficient reconstruction of many different multi-particle final states from B-decay, a **first specification is set that all charged tracks originating from short-lived particle decay and/or from the primary vertex be reconstructed with \(>95\)% efficiency for p\({}_{T}>0.5\) GeV and for \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\). Possible charge asymmetries arising from the detector geometry and/or inefficiencies in the track reconstruction should be kept below 1%. Finally a fourth class of tracks are those originating from secondary decays of long-lived particles, such as K\({}_{s}^{0}\) or \(\Lambda\). Accurate reconstruction of such decays with high efficiency is required for B-physics at low luminosity in general, and for studies of CP-violation through the channel B\({}_{d}^{0}~{}\rightarrow~{}J/\psi~{}K_{s}^{0}\) in particular [16]. A specification is therefore set that K\({}_{S}^{0}\)-decays with a decay radius less than 50 cm be reconstructed with an efficiency \(>90\)% (integrated over radius) at low luminosity.**

For CP-violation studies, it is important to design the tracker so that it has no built-in charge asymmetry.

## 6 b-Tagging

The issue of b-tagging should not be confused with B-physics. In a broad sense b-tagging means the identification of hadronic jets from b-decay, either through vertexing abilities (impact parameter cuts or secondary vertex reconstruction) or through soft lepton tags. Many studies over the past years have shown that b-tagging will be an important tool in the search for new physics, such as \(h~{}\rightarrow~{}b\overline{b}\) decays [17] or \(H^{\pm}~{}\rightarrow~{}tb\) decays [18] in SUSY events, and in the study of top quark physics [19]. These physics topics will most probably not be exhausted during initial low luminosity LHC operation. It is also important to note that b-tagging at LHC will not be very different from b-tagging in CDF [20]. The specification is therefore set that the inner tracker provide b-tagging, at least over \(|\eta|~{}<~{}1.5\), with an efficiency of \(\sim 30\)%, such that the rejection of non-b hadronic jets is \(>10\) (resp. 50) at high (resp. low) luminosity. This performance should be achieved typically for top events with top quark transverse momenta as large as 200 GeV.

## 7 Electron Identification

Basic work on electron identification at high luminosity can be found in [12, 15, 21]. These references include studies of particular backgrounds, such as photon conversions and single hadrons, as well as systematic studies of large-statistics QCD-jet samples. After calorimeter and track-matching cuts (within the above specifications), the backgrounds can be reduced to just below the rate of electrons from W-decays (this corresponds to a rejection against QCD jets of \(\sim~{}10^{5}\)). The remaining background at \(\mbox{p}_{T}\ \sim 20\) GeV is expected to be dominated by single charged hadrons which the TR-function can further reduce by more than an order of magnitude at high luminosity. **As discussed above, one of the main requirements from electron identification is the ability to reconstruct electrons with \(\mbox{p}_{T}\ >0.5\) GeV near high-\(\mbox{p}_{T}\) electron candidates with an efficiency (integrated over all \(\mbox{p}_{T}\)) above 90%. Another requirement is that bremsstrahlung effects due to the large amount of material in the inner tracker do not degrade the reconstruction efficiency of high-\(\mbox{p}_{T}\) electrons below 90%, both for second-level triggering and for offline analysis.**

As discussed above, b-tagging using soft leptons would be a useful tool to help reject backgrounds to new physics. This would require electron identification inside or nearby hadronic jets, a topic which needs further study to evaluate the overall potential of ATLAS (including calorimeter, preshower and transition radiation) for this more difficult task.

At low luminosity, the B-physics potential of ATLAS is significantly enhanced by the ability to use electrons from J/\(\psi\)-decays and electron tags. **This requires the reconstruction and identification of electrons of \(\mbox{p}_{T}\ >1\) GeV for \(|\eta|\ <2.5\) with an efficiency of \(>70\)%.** This could be implemented in the second level trigger, using the TR-function of the straws [22], which should provide a rejection against pions of \(\sim 30\) at 90% electron efficiency, in order to reduce the combinatorial background from charged hadrons to an acceptable level.

## 8 Photon Identification

The tracker is vital in the recognition of photons, especially for H\(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decays. The tracker is particularly needed to recover photon conversions, which might otherwise be tagged as \(\pi^{0}\)'s [23], while at the same time eliminating the potentially very large background from Z-decays to electrons. To explore the Higgs boson mass range near \(\mbox{m}_{Z}\) (a quite possible scenario in MSSM models), it is required that the inefficiency for finding photons with \(\mbox{p}_{T}\) around 60 GeV, due to the tracker alone, should not exceed 15%, while electrons are vetoed with an efficiency of \(>99.8\)%, and 70% of all \(\pi^{0}\)'s are rejected (using both calorimeter and tracker). Over most of the accessible Higgs boson mass range, however, the electron veto efficiency needed is less demanding.

Vertexing Requirements

Vertexing is required for a variety of physics topics. At high luminosity these include b-tagging for top quark physics and for rejection of backgrounds in Higgs to 4-lepton and new physics searches, as mentioned in the previous sections. The significance of the physics signals, and the power of the rejection keep increasing as the accuracy and \(\eta\)-coverage of the vertexing layers are increased. It is therefore not possible to choose an optimum specification. The basic physics studies done so far assumed an impact parameter resolution of approximately

\[\sigma_{IP}=30\oplus\frac{250}{p_{T}\sqrt{sin\theta}}\mu\mathrm{m}\]

for \(|\eta|<1.5\) and

\[\sigma_{IP}=40\oplus\frac{350}{p_{T}\sqrt{cos\theta}}\mu\mathrm{m}\]

for \(1.5<|\eta|<2.5\). This was shown to be sufficient for a wide variety of physics processes at high luminosity and **should be taken as the present high luminosity specification.**

A more stringent specification is desirable at low luminosity, where more difficult physics channels will be studied. These would need \(\tau\)-tagging, as in SUSY Higgs searches (A \(\rightarrow\tau\tau\), H\({}^{\pm}\rightarrow\tau\nu_{\tau}\)), and very precise vertexing as for the measurement of \(x_{s}\) and the full reconstruction of exclusive B-decays. **At low luminosity, the vertexing specification is, until further studies are performed**

\[\sigma_{IP}=14\ \oplus\frac{72}{p_{T}\sqrt{sin\theta}}\mu\mathrm{m}\]

**for \(|\eta|<1.5\).**

A study of the requirements from B-physics in terms of the z-coordinate resolution is in progress.

## 10 Primary Vertex Space Resolution

**The resolution of the z-coordinate of primary interactions with at least 4 tracks should be better than 1 mm.** This is to help separate primary vertices from pileup. No formal study has yet been made to justify this requirement.

Triggering

**There is no requirement for a level one track trigger.**

A level-two track trigger is required, mainly to reduce the large QCD-jet background in the level-one electron trigger. In addition such a trigger will be useful to improve the \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\)-threshold of the level-one muon trigger and possibly to reject background in the level-one photon trigger. The level-one single electromagnetic cluster trigger has an estimated rate of \(\sim\) 30 kHz. **The level-two track trigger should select tracks with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\ >\) 20 GeV, with \(>\) 90% efficiency, in regions of interest defined by the level-one trigger, and ensure a fake track rate of less than 10% per real track for QCD jets passing the level- one and level-two calorimeter triggers.**

Another crucial specification for the inner tracker from the level-two trigger point of view is that **for B-physics at low luminosity the inner tracker should be the main handle to reduce the level-one low-\(\mathrm{p}_{T}\) single muon trigger rate, without regions of interest, to a rate, which can be handled by the higher levels, while preserving the ATLAS detector potential for B-physics.** This specification can only become precise quantitatively when a comprehensive and complete survey of the various exclusive channels of interest will have been performed. From existing studies it appears that, for all B-decays not involving leptons, mass cuts will be needed to achieve an acceptable level-2 trigger rate (e.g. a rate of 350 Hz is expected for two reconstructed charged tracks with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}\ >\) 2 GeV, \(|\eta|<\ 2.5\) and an invariant mass between 4 and 6 GeV, a set of level-2 trigger cuts which could be used for \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{d}\ \rightarrow\ \pi^{+}\pi^{-}\) decays). It is also clear that other exclusive decays need a secondary-vertex trigger (impact parameter cuts will not be sufficient), for example \(\mathrm{B}^{0}_{S}\rightarrow\mathrm{D}_{S}\pi\)[24], a channel used for \(x_{s}\) measurements.

## 12 Material Budget

As already mentioned above, the total material in the tracker contributes to backgrounds by creating photon conversions and secondary interactions and to inefficiencies in electron reconstruction through hard photon bremsstrahlung. The most critical region is the inner radius, where photon conversions are most difficult to veto and where the impact of bremsstrahlung is most severe. **The total material in the tracker volume, up to an outer radius of 110 cm, should not exceed 30% of a radiation length, with less than 15% inside 40 cm, averaged over the tracker acceptance.** This average tracker material controls the total number of conversions in the tracker and the average electron reconstruction efficiency. If a high amount of tracker material is reached locally, a region of low photon/electron reconstruction efficiency will appear and the electromagnetic calorimeter resolution will be degraded. Accordingly, **no region of the tracker shall contain more than 50% of a radiation length in total.** There is no optimum for these material specifications: the less material the better. The last 5 cm of the tracker volume is currently expected to contain a polythene moderator to reduce the neutron damage. This would add a further 10% of a radiation length to the total tracker material and should be considered when discussing reduction of the material budget.

## 13 Power Budget

No full study has yet been completed for the power budget, but the overall power is limited both by practical considerations and by the need to avoid excessive material in power busses and cooling lines. The lowest possible power should be aimed at in all designs. A preliminary specification is that **the total power dissipated in the tracker volume should not exceed 20 kW.**

## 14 Financial Budget

**The ID budget should not exceed 70 MCH overall.**
