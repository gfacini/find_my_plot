**Impact of LHC bunch spacing scheme on the ATLAS detector and its performance**

**The ATLAS Collaboration**

**25 January 1993**

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS collaboration has investigated the impact of the two bunch spacing schemes, 15 ns or 25 ns, suggested for the LHC machine. This memorandum summarizes the arguments which have led us to conclude that the 25 ns bunch spacing option is to be preferred. It is, in fact, the best compromise between the potential of higher integrated luminosity and better machine performance (25 ns), easier and cheaper instrumentation (25 ns), and simpler pattern recognition from a lower rate of underlying minimum bias events (15 ns).

The potential to achieve eventually a factor of \(\sim\)1.5 in absolute luminosity is very attractive in itself. Even more attractive to us is that the same higher integrated luminosity is available already at low intensity for the same number of protons circulating in the machine. Furthermore there seems to be a fair chance that the larger bunch spacing could result in a more stable machine which in turn would provide a better machine performance and thus more integrated luminosity.

The second point clearly in favour of a larger bunch spacing concerns the instrumentation and more particularly the electronics:

* 40 MHz clock frequency versus 67 MHz, thus simpler electronics, a pipeline with less buckets, and therefore reduced costs;
* easier synchronisation of different subsystems;
* lower power consumption;
* easier bunch crossing identification.

The impact of the 15 ns versus 25 ns bunch spacing on the physics performance is discussed in the following chapter.

We assume the same peak luminosity, \(L=1.7\cdot 10^{34}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\), for both schemes, yielding an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\ pb^{-1}\) per year of running. The corresponding
