The possibility of extracting a signal from the production of squarks and gluinos using the \(E_{T}^{miss}+\) jets signature is studied. The simulation includes a detailed modelling of gluino and squark decay in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), followed by a simplified description of the ATLAS detector. An evaluation is performed of the mass reach of the detector over the full MSSM parameter space. The discovery range for the ATLAS detector is found to be: 1.7/2.0/2.3 TeV for \(m_{d}\)\(\approx\)\(m_{s}\) respectively for integrated luminosities of \(10^{3}/10^{4}/10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), and of 1.05/1.3/1.55 TeV for \(m_{d}\)=\(2m_{s}\) for the three luminosity scenarios, under the assumptions quoted in the text.

Phenomenology

Squarks and gluinos are pair produced in hadronic collisions, through the processes pp \(\to\)\(\tilde{g}\tilde{g}\), \(\tilde{q}\tilde{g}\), \(\tilde{q}\tilde{q}\) with cross-sections which at the LHC vary from about 1000 pb to 1 pb for squark and gluino masses in the range 200 GeV -1 TeV.

A distinctive signature of most supersymmetric theories is the introduction of a multiplicative quantum number, the R parity, which is 1 for normal particles and \(-1\) for their superpartners. As a consequence of R-invariance, the sparticles are produced in pairs, and all decay to the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). The LSP must be neutral, in order to satisfy cosmological constraints, and interacts weakly, thus escaping the detectors. Therefore any production of supersymmetric particles should be characterized by the presence of a \(E_{T}^{miss}\) signature generated by the LSPs escaping detection. The actual nature of the LSP, and the decay chains through which gluinos and squarks decay to the LSP depend on the specific SUSY model chosen. The experimental study presented in this note is based on the MSSM, the minimal SUSY extension of the Standard Model, described in detail e.g. in [1]. For our purposes, it may be sufficient to note that the MSSM is the extension of the Standard Model with exact R-parity conservation, characterized by a minimal Gauge group, a minimal particle content, and some assumptions on the parametrization of Supersymmetry breaking. The Higgs sector of the Standard Model is extended to include two doublets necessary to give mass respectively to the up and down components of the SU(2) doublets, thus giving rise to 5 physical higgs bosons. In the MSSM the LSP is assumed to be the lightest neutralino ( mixing of the neutral higgsinos and gauginos). In the MSSM the mass spectra of gauginos and higgsinos and the gluino and squark decay chains are uniquely fixed by the choice of 5 parameters:

* the mass of any of the Higgs particles (we use the \(\bf{H^{+}}\) mass)
* \(\tan(\beta)\), the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets required by the theory,
* the gluino mass,
* an average squark mass,
* the higgs-higgsino mass term \(\mu\).

To these, the only parameter still unknown in the Standard Model, the top quark mass, has to be added. The decay patterns for \(\tilde{q}\) and \(\tilde{g}\) in the MSSM,due to the mixing of the higgsino-neutralino sector, is quite complicated. It involves the decay into any of the 4 neutralinos and 2 charginos kinematically allowed, plus ordinary quarks or Intermediate Vector Bosons (IVB's). The heavier charginos and neutralinos in turn cascade to the LSP. A wealth of complementary signatures, also including the presence of leptons from IVB decays are thus available, depending on the choice of MSSM parameters. The \(E_{T}^{miss}+\) jets signature, although less striking than in the case of \(\tilde{g}\) and \(\tilde{q}\) direct decays to the LSP, still retains a place of choice as the main avenue in the search for a SUSY signal, thanks to the high cross-section, and the relative independence, as we shall see, from the choice of the MSSM parameters. In case an excess of events with respect to SM expectations were to be observed for the topologies considered in this study, proper consideration of all possible multileptonic signatures for gluino decays will be needed in order to restrict the class of models giving rise to the observed signal. Detailed explorations of the most promising alternative signatures for gluino decays are or will be documented in other ATLAS notes.

The \(E_{T}^{miss}+\) jets signal has in the past been the object of several studies, in particular [2], which included also the \(\tilde{g}\) and \(\tilde{q}\) cascade decays. The present study is based on a different MonteCarlo simulation of the signal, incorporating a self-contained calculation of MSSM phenomenology, thus allowing a more detailed exploration of the MSSM parameter space.

## 2 Signal and background event generation

The ISASUSY [3] MonteCarlo is used to generate the supersymmetry signal. As the name suggests, this is a modified version of ISAJET [4], consisting of the following elements: at initialisation the higgsino and gaugino masses and branching fractions are calculated, starting from the MSSM parameters given in input. This information is then loaded into the decay tables of ISAJET. Subsequently, weight one events are generated with a hit and miss technique, from the leading order matrix elements for \(\tilde{g}\tilde{g}\), \(\tilde{q}\tilde{q}\), \(\tilde{g}\tilde{q}\) production. The resulting final state is presented to ISAJET which decays the generated sparticles and simulates initial and final state parton cascades and the underlying event.

Backgrounds to the signal are Standard Model processes with emission of high \(P_{T}\) neutrinos accompanied by jets. The processes considered are:

* \(t\overline{t}\) production, with m\({}_{top}\) fixed at 140 GeV, and at least one of the two Ws from top decay going to lepton (e,\(\mu\),\(\tau\)) neutrino * Production of IVB's, where gluons are radiated from the initial state quarks, giving rise to hadronic jets. The production of Z + Jets, with Z\(\rightarrow\nu\nu\), and W + Jets, with W\(\rightarrow\tau\nu\), where the \(\tau\) decays hadronically, give rise to the standard \(E_{T}^{miss}\)+ jets signature. The background generated by W + Jets production, with W\(\rightarrow(e,\mu)\nu\) can in principle be reduced by rejecting events containing an isolated electron or muon. In practice most of the cascade decays of the gluinos involve one or more IVB's, so that the lepton veto enhances only in a marginal way the signal over square root of background ratio, as already noted in [2]. In addition such a cut would bring into the simulation uncertainties related to the efficiency of lepton identification and isolation criteria. For these reasons the analysis presented below does not rely on selection criteria involving electrons and muons.

All of these backgrounds have been generated using PYTHIA 5.6. [5] For each of the background channels the generation was performed in bins of the P\({}_{T}\) of the produced particle (top or IVB). The generated statistics for the highest bin corresponds to integrated luminosities of the order of 5000 to 10000 pb\({}^{-1}\). The use of this procedure for generation is made necessary by the very high cross section for the considered background sources, and is justified, by the very good correlation between P\({}_{T}\) of the generated particle and the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) in the event. In the case of IVB + jets production, the processes leading to IVB + 1 jet have been used in PYTHIA. For the additional jets the generation relies on the simulation of initial and final state radiation. A comparison with matrix element calculations of W,Z + multijet production will be needed to evaluate the reliability of the IVB background estimates presented below.

The instrumental background due to multijet events where \(E_{T}^{miss}\)is generated by a high E\({}_{T}\) jet falling into an insensitive region of the detector was not considered in this analysis. Preliminary studies on the incidence of this kind of background indicate that, for the experimental cuts described below, this background contribution should not be important for a first approximation of the detector boundaries in ATLAS.

## 3 Detector simulation

This study is based on a simple detector simulation, where the generated particles deposit their energy in a \(\eta-\phi\) grid in space extending from \(-5\) to \(+5\) in pseudorapidity over the full azimuth with a granularity of \(0.05\times 0.05\). The deposited energy is smeared according to \(10\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 1\%\) for electronsand photons, and \(50\%/\sqrt{E}\oplus 2\%\) for hadrons. No lateral or longitudinal smearing is applied to the energy deposition.

Jet reconstruction is performed inside the pseudorapidity range \(\pm\)3, by collecting all the energy in cones of extension \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}<0.5\) around a seed cell required to have E\({}_{T}>\) 10 GeV. Lepton detection (not explicitly used in this study) is performed out to a pseudorapidity of 2.5. The muon energy is smeared according to a function reproducing the expected muon resolution for the ATLAS detector baseline design.

## 4 Results

A reduction in the size of the multidimensional parameter space to be explored can be obtained by using the fact, pointed out in [6], that the \(E_{T}^{miss}+\) jets signature is only mildly dependent on the values of the parameters M\({}_{H^{+}}\), tan\(\beta\) and \(\mu\). Therefore this study was performed in the \(m_{\tilde{q}}\)- \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) parameter plane, keeping the remaining parameters fixed at the following reference values:

* \(\mu=-440\) GeV (Higgs-higgsino mass term)
* \(\tan\beta=2\) (Ratio of vacuum expectation values)
* \(M_{H^{\pm}}\) = 500 GeV (Charged Higgs mass)
* \(M_{t}=140\) GeV (Top mass).

Two sets of points were generated:

* \(m_{\tilde{q}}\) = 2\(\cdot m_{\tilde{g}}\) for \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) = 300, 500, 750, 1000, 1200, 1500 GeV
* \(m_{\tilde{q}}\) = \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) +10 GeV, for \(m_{\tilde{g}}\) = 400, 800, 1500, 2000, 2500 GeV.

The case \(m_{\tilde{q}}\)\(<m_{\tilde{g}}\) has been the object of a separate study. It has however been checked for some sample points that the results for \(m_{\tilde{q}}\)= \(m_{\tilde{g}}\)\(-\) 10 GeV, notwithstanding the different decay pattern, are compatible with the \(m_{\tilde{q}}\)= \(m_{\tilde{g}}\)+ 10 GeV case.

The dependence on the parameters \(\mu\) and tan\(\beta\) has been checked by fixing \(m_{\tilde{q}}\)= 2\(\cdot\)\(m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(m_{\tilde{g}}\)=500 GeV, and by generating the following points in parameter space:* tan\(\beta\) = 2, \(\mu\) = \(-\)440, \(-\)150, 0, 150, 440 GeV
* tan\(\beta\) = 10, \(\mu\) = \(-\)440 GeV.

For each of the mentioned points in parameter space a sample of 10000 events was generated.

The \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution of the signal for some points in parameter space is shown in Fig. 1, superimposed to the expected SM background for \(E_{T}^{miss}\)\(>\) 150 GeV, before any cut on the event topology is applied. The signal already stands out very clearly over the background for a wide range of masses for \(m_{\tilde{q}}\)\(\approx m_{\tilde{q}}\) if an appropriate cut on \(E_{T}^{miss}\) is applied. The situation is worse for \(m_{\tilde{q}}\)\(=2\cdot m_{\tilde{q}}\), for which the signal is always lower than the background. This is due to the fact that in the \(m_{\tilde{q}}\)\(\approx m_{\tilde{q}}\) case the production cross-section is higher, due to the fact that three processes, \(\tilde{g}\tilde{g}\), \(\tilde{q}\tilde{g}\), \(\tilde{q}\tilde{q}\) production contribute to the cross-section. Moreover the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) spectrum is harder, due to the production of the SUSY partners of right-handed quarks, which, for \(m_{\tilde{q}}\)\(\approx m_{\tilde{q}}\) decay with almost 100 % branching ratio directly to the LSP.

Two characteristics of the signal can be used to improve the signal/background ratio:

* The signal, due to the complex decay patterns, has a higher jet multiplicity than the background. This is a particularly good handle to reject IVB background, where the presence of additional jets is suppressed by powers of \(\alpha_{s}\). Moreover, especially for high gluino masses, the \(E_{T}\) spectra of jets tend to be harder.
* In the gluino mass range of interest, the signal is expected to be more isotropically distributed in space than the background. A variable which can be used to put this observation on a quantitative ground is circularity C, computed from the transverse projection of the calorimeter jets (\(E_{T}>10\) GeV), and the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) vector, defined as \(C=2\cdot min(\sum E_{T}\cdot\hat{n})^{2}/(\sum E_{T}^{2})\)

The distributions for signal and background of circularity and jet multiplicities are shown in Figs. 2 and 3.

Two sets of cuts were selected, in order to assess the highest mass range which we will be able to explore with the ATLAS detector:

* at least 3 jets with \(E_{T}>200\) GeV, a fourth jet with \(E_{T}>100\) GeV, \(C>0.2\), and \(E_{T}^{miss}\)\(>300\) GeV (Cut 1);* The same as above with \(E_{T}^{miss}\)\(>\) 600 GeV (Cut 2).

The cuts on the \(E_{T}\) of the jets are chosen with the aim of optimizing the background rejection while retaining the majority of the events for the higher gluino masses. This is illustrated in figures 4 and 5 which show the \(E_{T}\) spectra of the third and fourth hardest jet in the event for signal and background.

The \(E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions for signal and background after the cuts on the jet topology have been applied are shown in Fig. 6. With a cut on \(E_{T}^{miss}\) between 300 and 600 GeV, the signal is of the same order of magnitude or bigger than the background for the highest masses considered.

The cross sections, before and after cuts, for the different contributions to the background and for the considered points in parameter space are shown in tables 1 to 4 and in figures 7 and 8. The significance of the observable signal, expressed as Signal over square root of Background (S/\(\sqrt{B}\)) is shown in figures 9 and 10. Assuming that a signal can be detected if its significance is above 5, the discovery range for the ATLAS detector is: 1.7/2.0/2.3 TeV for \(m_{q}\)\(\approx\)\(m_{\tilde{g}}\) respectively for integrated luminosities of \(10^{3}/10^{4}/10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), and of 1.05/1.3/1.55 TeV for \(m_{q}\)=2\(m_{\tilde{g}}\) for the three luminosity scenarios.

In the low mass region, around 300 GeV, the results of this analysis seem to indicate that there should be no problem in detecting a gluino signal. However, in this mass region, where softer cuts on the kinematical variables could be applied, the instrumental background from mismeasured multijet events needs to be evaluated carefully.

The conclusions reached are approximately valid over all of the parameter space. Table 3 shows the way different choices of the MSSM parameters would affect the acceptance for the signal. By varying the \(\mu\) parameter the signal would decrease by at most 30 %, apart from the point \(\mu=0\), already excluded by the LEP results, which would be reduced by 50 %. We therefore evaluate an uncertainty of the order of 150 GeV on the accessible mass range due to the choice of MSSM parameters.

We list in the following some issues which should be addressed to complete the present study:

* The instrumental background needs to be studied carefully, through the actual simulation of multijet events, taking into acount a detailed description of the dead regions in the calorimeter. For high luminosity running, the pile-up of many minimum bias events could affect the jet multiplicity and the jet spectra, thus modifying the conclusions of the present analysis. Work is already in progress in order to evaluate these effects.
* The uncertainties in the estimate of Standard Model background should be evaluated, in particular with regard to IVB+jets production, as already mentioned above.
* The \(E_{T}^{miss}+\) jets signature does not give a very clear differentiation between signal and background. Therefore we should develop strategies to evaluate from the data themselves the actual background contribution, in order to be able to claim the production of an excess of events with respect to the Standard Model predictions. Once an excess of events is found, the assessment of the actual nature of the discovered new physics will require an investigation of all possible decay signatures predicted by the different candidate models.
