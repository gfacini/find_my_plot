###### Abstract

The sensitivity of the ATLAS experiment for the discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson in the associated \(WH\,\)production with the subsequent decays \(W\to l\nu\,\)and \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) is presented. In the analysis of the three lepton final states electrons and muons are considered including the contributions from leptonic tau decays. Signal and background rates and the final signal significance are evaluated for a Standard Model Higgs boson in the mass range between 150 and 190 GeV and for integrated luminosities of 30 and 100 \(fb^{-1}\).

Introduction

It has been suggested recently [1], that the associated production of a Higgs boson with a W boson, with the subsequent decays \(W\to l\nu\,\)and \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) provides an additional Higgs boson discovery channel at the LHC. The three-lepton final state appears promising, since the expected background levels are low. This channel is the associated production channel to the inclusive \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) channel [2]. Hence, the same general arguments as in the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) case about the signal extraction apply; since no mass peak can be reconstructed, evidence for a Higgs boson signal has to be extracted from an excess of events above the expected background.

The channel under study is also interesting for the determination of the Higgs boson couplings, since in the production and decay chain only the couplings to gauge bosons appear. In almost all production and/or decay processes which can be studied at the LHC, Yukawa couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions are involved. In a scenario with only weak couplings of the Higgs boson to fermion pairs, this channel would remain unaffected, whereas all the others, except WH with \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), would be suppressed.

The results of a first look at this channel have been reported in Ref. [3] for a Higgs boson mass of 160 GeV. In the present note a more detailed study of the ATLAS sensitivity for the Higgs boson discovery in this channel is presented. Using the fast simulation program ATLFAST [4] the sensitivity has been evaluated for Higgs boson masses in the range between 150 and 190 GeV.

In Section 2 the signal and background cross sections are given. The kinematic selection criteria which have been applied to separate the signal from the background are discussed in Section 3. This section also contains a study of the additional background rejection using jet veto cuts. The expected numbers of signal and background events at the LHC are presented in Section 4, together with an evaluation of the signal significance. In the last section, it is briefly discussed to what extent the transverse mass distribution can be used to improve the signal significance and to obtain information on the Higgs boson mass.

It should be noted that the present analysis differs in a few points from the one presented in the _ATLAS Detector and Physics Performance Technical Design Report_[5]: the contributions from leptonic \(\tau\) decays have been taken into account in both the signal and background processes, the background from \(ZZ\) continuum production has been included and the \(t\bar{t}\) background has been evaluated more reliably by generating high statistics Monte Carlo event samples.

Cross sections for signal and background processes

All signal and background cross-sections, except the one for the \(Wt\) production, for which the ONETOP [6] Monte Carlo program has been used, have been calculated using the PYTHIA [7] Monte Carlo program. No K-factors have been included, therefore contributions from higher order QCD corrections are ignored for both signal and background processes.

The signal cross sections times leptonic branching ratios (\(W\to l\nu\) with \(l=e,\mu,\tau\)) for this associated production channel are small, at the level of 8 - 15 fb in the mass range considered. The values are given in Table 1 as a function of the Higgs boson mass. The branching ratios for leptonic tau decays are not yet included. Hadronic \(\tau\) decays will not lead to three high \(P_{T}\) leptons and the loss of these events will be included in the acceptance numbers quoted below.

There are important background processes to this channel with production cross-sections which are several orders of magnitude higher than the signal cross-sections:

* \(WZ\) production constitutes the most important irreducible background, since three leptons are produced from leptonic vector boson decays. A high rejection against this background can be achieved by applying a cut on the invariant mass of opposite-sign same-flavour lepton pairs, where events with a dilepton mass around the Z-mass are vetoed. The cross section times leptonic branching ratios (\(W\to l\nu\) and \(Z\to l^{+}l^{-}\) with \(l=e,\mu,\tau\)) is 855 fb.
* ZZ production is another potentially dangerous background, if both Z-bosons decay leptonically and one of the four final state leptons (\(e,\mu\)) is not identified in the detector or is outside the lepton acceptance. A three-lepton final state can also be produced if one of the Z bosons decays to an electron or muon pair and the other one to taus, of which one decays leptonically to an electron or a muon. The ZZ cross section times leptonic branching ratio is 158 fb.
* \(t\bar{t}\) production is the background process with the largest production cross section. In this case one of the three leptons must originate from a semileptonic b-decay. Therefore, b-tagging and/or lepton isolation criteria might be used

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l c||c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\mathbf{m_{H}}\) & (GeV) & **150** & **160** & **170** & **180** & **190** \\ \hline \hline \(\sigma_{WH\to WWWW\ast}\times BR_{lep}\) & (fb) & 13.30 & 15.52 & 13.82 & 11.16 & 7.90 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

to reject this background. In addition, the \(P_{T}\) - spectrum of the third lepton is expected to be significantly softer than in signal events. Top production is also characterized by large jet activity and the three leptons are usually accompanied by at least one (b-quark) jet. Therefore, also a tight jet veto will lead to a significant rejection of \(t\bar{t}\) events.
* Single top production, \(Wt\), is another background which can be suppressed by using impact parameter, lepton isolation and/or jet veto cuts. As mentioned above, this background has been generated using the ONETOP Monte Carlo program [6].
* In addition to these major backgrounds, also \(Wb\overline{b}\) and \(b\overline{b}\) production have to be considered as a source of three lepton final states. However, it has been shown [3] that their contribution is negligible, if reasonably high lepton \(P_{T}\) cuts and/or isolation criteria are applied.

The background cross sections times leptonic \(W\) and \(Z\) branching ratios are summarised in Table 2. They are significantly larger than the signal cross sections: for a Higgs boson with a mass of 160 GeV, for example, the \(WZ\) and the \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds are about 55 and 4000 times higher, respectively, than the signal cross section.

## 3 Event selection

### Kinematic selection

Several cuts have been studied, which can be applied to achieve the necessary rejection against the large backgrounds. The distributions of some relevant variables are shown in Fig.1 for a Higgs boson signal with a mass of 160 GeV and for background events from \(WZ\) and \(t\bar{t}\) production. It should be noted that all distributions have been normalized to unity, such that their shapes can be compared. The distribution of the transverse momentum of the third lepton, as expected, is found to be softer

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|} \hline Background process & \(\sigma\times BR_{\it{lep}}\) (fb) \\ \hline \(WZ\) & 855 \\ \(ZZ\) & 158 \\ \(t\bar{t}\) & 62400 \\ \(Wt\) & 7800 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The semileptonic branching ratios for \(b\)-decays have not been included._for \(t\bar{t}\) events than for \(WZ\) or signal events. A hard cut on the transverse momentum of the third lepton will lead to a strong rejection of the \(t\bar{t}\) background. The \(WZ\) background on the other hand can be strongly rejected by vetoing those events which have at least one pair of opposite-sign, same-flavour leptons with an invariant mass compatible with the Z-mass. As an example, the invariant mass distribution of the two leading leptons is shown for signal and background events, if they have the same flavour and opposite sign. The Z-resonance peak is clearly visible. The events outside the Z-mass region are due to contributions from the Breit-Wigner tail and to contributions from leptonic decays. In the final signal selection, the event will be rejected if at least one pair of this type with an invariant mass close to the Z mass will be found.

Figure 1 shows also the distributions of the azimuthal separation \(\Delta\phi\) and of the pseudorapidity separation \(\Delta\eta\) between the two leading leptons in the event, again for signal events and for events from \(WZ\) and \(t\bar{t}\) production. There is a striking difference in the shape of the \(\Delta\phi\) distribution between signal and background events. Whereas the \(\Delta\phi\) distribution is peaked at large values around \(\pi\) for background events, a component with a small azimuthal separation can be identified for signal events. Such a component is expected since the decay of a scalar Higgs boson into two vector bosons results in two W's with opposite spin orientation. This spin correlation has already been exploited in the study of the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) channel [2]. The component at small \(\Delta\phi\) values in the distribution for signal events results from those events where the two leading leptons originate from the Higgs decay. Therefore one would search in the final signal selection for at least one pair of opposite sign leptons which fulfills tight angular cuts, in a similar way as applied in the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) analysis [2]. The effects of the spin-correlation are also visible in the distribution of the pseudorapidity separation \(\Delta\eta\). Both the \(\Delta\phi\) and the \(\Delta\eta\) variable will therefore be used to construct a so called \(H\to WW^{(*)}\) tag (see below).

Based on these studies, the following kinematical selection criteria have been applied:

* Three isolated leptons (electrons or muons) are required with \(P_{T}>P_{T}^{0}\) in the pseudorapidity interval \(|\eta|<2.5\). The exact cut value \(P_{T}^{0}\) has to be optimised together with other cuts, as discussed below. If a fourth lepton with \(P_{T}>10\) GeV is identified, the event is rejected. The last cut rejects mainly \(ZZ\) events, without a big loss of signal efficiency.

Figure 1: _The distributions of the transverse momentum \(P_{T}(e)\) of the thirdlepton, the invariant mass \(m_{ll}\) of opposite-sign, same-flavour leptons, the azimuthal separation \(\Delta\phi\) between the two leading leptons and the difference in pseudorapidity \(\Delta\eta\) between the two leading leptons for signal events (\(m_{H}\) = 160 GeV), \(WZ\) and \(t\bar{t}\) background events. All distributions are normalised to unity._

* Same-flavour lepton veto: events which contain at least one pair of opposite-charge same-flavour leptons with an invariant mass between 60 and 120 GeV are rejected. Since WZ and ZZ production with both direct decays to electrons and muons and cascade decays via tau leptons constitute a very severe background, a rather large window around the Z-mass is cut out to suppress it. It should be noted that this mass window is larger than the one used in other analyses, like for example in the \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to 4l\) analysis, where a mass window of \(\pm\) 6 GeV is used.
* \(H\to WW^{(*)}\)tag: out of the three possible lepton pairs at least one should fulfil the tight angular cuts as used in the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) analysis [2]. It is required that there is at least one pair of leptons with opposite charge, \(\Delta\phi<1.0\), \(\Delta\eta<1.5\) and an invariant dilepton mass smaller than 80 GeV. If none of the three possible lepton pairs fulfils these requirements the event is rejected.

The second and the third cut have large rejections against the \(WZ\) background. The same flavour lepton veto rejects the \(WZ\) background by a factor of 100 for a signal efficiency of about 70%. The residual \(WZ\) background contains either an off-shell \(Z\) or a \(Z\to\tau\tau\to l\nu l\nu\ +X\) decay. The normalised distributions of the number of reconstructed \(H\to WW^{(*)}\)tags are shown in Fig. 2 for signal events with \(m_{H}=160\) GeV and for the \(WZ\) and the \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds. Given the three possible lepton pairs, the number of reconstructed tags must lie between zero and three. The requirement of at least one \(H\to WW^{(*)}\)tag rejects the \(WZ\) background by a factor of 2.7 and the \(t\bar{t}\) background by a factor of 3.5 for a signal efficiency of 88%.

Figure 2: _Normalised distributions of the number of reconstructed \(H\to WW^{(*)}\)tags for signal events with \(m_{H}=160\) GeV and for \(WZ\) and \(t\bar{t}\) background events._

The expected signal and background cross sections after applying these cuts are given in Table 3 for lepton \(P_{T}\)thresholds (\(P_{T}^{0}\)) of 20, 25 and 30 GeV. These numbers were obtained by multiplying the corresponding numbers given in Tables 1 and 2 by the acceptance of the kinematic cuts described above. In addition, a lepton reconstruction efficiency of 90% per lepton has been taken into account.

The numbers given in Table 3 show that for low lepton \(P_{T}\) thresholds the selected events are dominated by the large \(t\overline{t}\) and \(Wt\) backgrounds. The signal to background ratio increases from 8% to 35% if the \(P_{T}^{0}\) value is raised from 20 to 30 GeV. It should be noted that a high signal to background ratio is important for this channel, since the systematic uncertainty on the signal significance is dominated by the uncertainty on the background level. For a 30 GeV lepton \(P_{T}\)threshold a large background rejection can be achieved. Already at the level of these kinematic cuts a Higgs boson signal with \(m_{H}=160\) GeV could be observed at the LHC with a significance of \(\sim\)4\(\sigma\), if an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\) is assumed and systematic uncertainties are neglected.

Since the background rates are very sensitive to the lepton \(P_{T}\) cut, they might be affected by large systematic uncertainties resulting for instance from uncertainties in the b-quark fragmentation function. It should be noted that for the dominant top backgrounds the third lepton originates most likely from a B-meson decay. Therefore, it is also important to demonstrate that less stringent cuts on the lepton \(P_{T}\) can be used, and other variables can be exploited for the background rejection. As mentioned above, the large top backgrounds can be further suppressed if strict jet veto cuts and/or impact parameter and isolation cuts are applied. An accurate estimate of the rejection of the latter two can only be done in a full detector simulation of signal and background events. Since such a full simulation has not yet been performed, only the rejection of jet-veto cuts will be studied in the following, together with the rejection which can be achieved if an unlike sign lepton veto, as suggested in Ref.[1], is applied.

### Additional background rejection

#### 3.2.1 Jet vecto cuts

The events passing the selection criteria listed above have been subjected to a jet veto cut. It has been required that no jet with a transverse energy exceeding a given threshold should be reconstructed in the pseudorapidity interval \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\) 3.2. At low luminosity running it should be possible to apply a tight veto, with a jet \(P_{T}\) threshold as low as 15 GeV. Due to the minimum bias pileup this veto has to be relaxed at high luminosity running. It has been assumed that the minimal jet veto threshold which can be applied at high luminosity is 30 GeV.

After such a jet veto is applied, the accepted signal and background cross sections presented in Table 4 are obtained at low luminosity. As before, a lepton reconstruction efficiency of 90% per lepton has been included. The results obtained without applying a jet veto (\(P_{T}(jet)=\infty\)) are included for reference in the Table.

As can be seen, it is possible to suppress the \(t\bar{t}\) background by an additional factor of \(\sim\)28 for a lepton \(P_{T}\) threshold of 20 GeV, if a strict jet veto (no jets with \(P_{T}\)\(>\) 15 GeV within \(|\)\(\eta\)\(|\)\(<\) 3.2) is applied. For a jet veto at 30 GeV, still a rejection factor of \(\sim\)8 is retained. It can also be seen, that the jet veto is less effective for the \(Wt\) background, since these events have less jet activity.

For soft lepton \(P_{T}\) cuts the top backgrounds remain dominant, even if jet veto cuts are applied. This is in particular true for a high luminosity running scenario, where only a higher veto threshold of 30 GeV can be applied. The best signal to background ratio and the best signal significance, expressed in terms of \(S/\sqrt{B}\), is obtained for a lepton \(P_{T}\) threshold of 30 GeV in combination with tight jet veto cuts. For a jet veto

If for the same luminosity a tight jet veto of 15 GeV could be applied, this significance would slightly increase to 7.2 \(\sigma\). These numbers should only be considered as indicative, since the Gaussian approach is used and no systematic uncertainties are taken into account. Compared to the results obtained in the previous Section, both the signal-to-background ratio and the signal significance can be substantially improved by applying jet veto cuts.

#### 3.2.2 Unlike sign lepton veto

It has been pointed out in Ref.[1] that the dominant \(t\overline{t}\) background can also be strongly suppressed if those events are rejected where the two leading leptons have an opposite charge sign. In \(t\overline{t}\) events the two leading leptons emerge most likely from the two opposite sign W's from the direct top decays and hence have opposite charge. In signal events there is a reasonable probablity that one of the two leading leptons comes from the W which is produced in association with the Higgs and hence has no charge correlation with the leading lepton originating from the Higgs decays.

In the present simulation it has been found that about 90% of the \(t\overline{t}\) background events could be rejected, by a straightforward rejection of events with opposite charge leading leptons. However, there would also be a loss of about 60% of signal events. It has therefore been suggested in Ref.[1] to use a logical _OR_. Events passing rather low \(P_{T}\) lepton thresholds are kept if the two fastest leptons have the same sign. If they have an opposite sign the third lepton is required to pass a higher \(P_{T}\) threshold.

This idea has been applied in the present study and it has been investigated whether better signal-to-background conditions could be reached if a priori a lower \(P_{T}\) threshold is used for the third lepton. Only in the case of opposite sign leading leptons the high threshold value of 30 GeV is applied. In addition to the looser kinematic cuts, a jet veto cut of 30 GeV is applied. The results are presented in Table 5. It can be seen that the \(t\overline{t}\) background increases by an order of magnitude if the \(P_{T}\) threshold for the third lepton is lowered from 30 to 20 GeV (see results given in the first and second row of the Table). This increase can only be partially compensated if in the case of opposite sign leading leptons a higher threshold for the third lepton is applied. Even for the 30 GeV threshold the final signal to background ratio is slightly worse compared to the case where the 30 GeV is applied to all leptons, regardless of the charge configuration of the two leading ones. It should also be noted that these standard thresholds are applied anyhow in 90% of the cases for \(t\overline{t}\) events.

As already mentioned above, a significant fraction of the WZ and ZZ background arises from events where one Z decays to \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and the \(\tau\)'s subsequently decay

Table 5: Cross sections times acceptance for a Higgs boson signal of 160 GeV and the background processes for various \(P_{T}\) cuts on the third lepton. In addition to the kinematic cuts also a jet veto cut of 30 GeV has been applied. The \(P_{T}\) cut on the third lepton depends on the charge configuration of the two leading leptons (see text). Different threshold values are applied for the case of opposite sign and same sign leading leptons. The original lepton \(P_{T}\) thresholds for the three leptons are given in the first column (\(P_{T}^{0}\)), the higher threshold for the third lepton is given in the second column (\(P_{T}^{3}\)). If a \(P_{T}^{OS}\) cut (see text) is applied in addition, the cut value is included in the second column. A lepton reconstruction efficiency of 90% per lepton has been included.

leptonically. In this case the leptons from the \(\tau\) decay are softer than the leptons from the Higgs or W decays. In Ref.[1] the variable

\[P_{T}^{OS}\ =\ min\ \left\{P_{T}(l^{\mp})+P_{T}(l_{1}^{\pm})\,P_{T}(l^{\mp})+P_{T}(l_ {2}^{\pm})\right\}\]

has been suggested to reject part of the \(\tau\) contribution. Among the \(WZ\to l_{1}^{\pm}\ l^{\mp}l_{2}^{\pm}\) event sample, the unique charge lepton (\(l^{\mp}\)) must come from the Z decay. The other two leptons with opposite charge come either from the W or Z. If the leptons originate from \(Z\to\tau\tau\) decays, they will be softer than the one from the W. Therefore, \(P_{T}^{OS}\) usually sums the \(P_{T}\)s of the two leptons which come from \(Z\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to l^{+}l^{-}\).

The normalised distribution of \(P_{T}^{OS}\) is shown in Fig.3 for the signal (\(m_{H}=160\) GeV) and the summed background, after lepton \(P_{T}\) cuts (30/30/20 GeV for the three leptons respectively) and the other kinematic cuts listed in Section 3.1 have been applied. Although the spectrum from the signal events is found to be somewhat harder than the spectrum from background events, there is no large gain in the signal significance if a cut on \(P_{T}^{OS}\) is applied. The best signal significance is however found if a cut of 70 GeV is applied in addition to the cuts discussed previously. The corresponding results are included in Table 5. The expected event numbers are however comparable to the ones obtained for the reference case discussed above.

#### 3.2.3 Requirements for impact parameter cuts and lepton isolation

As mentioned before, the rejection of impact parameter and isolation requirements have not been addressed in the present study since a time consuming and extensive full detector simulation would be needed. The results obtained so far can however be used to deduce what rejection would be needed to obtain the same signal significance as with high \(P_{T}\) lepton cuts. These numbers can then be confronted with estimates for impact parameter and isolation rejection as obtained from a full simulation of the \(t\bar{t}\) background performed for the \(H\to Z\,Z^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\) channel [8].

From the numbers quoted in Table 4 it can be seen that by going from 20 to 30 GeV lepton cuts the \(t\bar{t}\) background is rejected by a factor of about 15, if a jet veto cut of 30 GeV is applied. A similar factor is found for a jet veto cut of 15 GeV. The signal acceptance drops at the same time by a factor 0.58, also independent of the jet veto cut applied.

In the full simulation study of Ref.[8] the \(t\bar{t}\) background rejection has been determined as a function of the \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\) signal efficiency for both, impact parameter cuts and lepton isolation cuts. For the impact parameter cut a rejection of about 25 is found for a signal efficiency of 60%. Given the four isolated prompt leptons in the event, this number corresponds to a single lepton efficiency of 88%.

Figure 3: _The distributions of \(P_{T}^{OS}\), which is defined as the minimum \(P_{T}\) sum of opposite sign leptons in three lepton events, for signal events with \(m_{H}=\) 160 GeV and for the summed background contributions. The kinematic cuts described in Section 3.1 have already been applied, with lepton \(P_{T}\) thresholds of 30, 30 and 20 GeV for the three leptons, ordered in \(P_{T}\), respectively._For the combination of the impact parameter cut with the isolation requirements, a total rejection of 800 against \(t\overline{t}\) events has been found at high luminosity for a signal efficiency of 52%.

These numbers can however not be directly applied to the present three lepton case. In the four lepton case, two instead of only one lepton originate from b-quark decays. In addition, the quoted numbers have been determined without the application of any jet-veto cuts, which might have an impact on the isolation rejection.

In a first approximation it can be assumed that both leptons from b-decays in \(t\overline{t}\) events are independent and that therefore in the three lepton events an impact parameter rejection of about 5 (\(=\sqrt{25}\)) can be achieved for a signal efficiency of about 68%. The efficiency number has been obtained from the value for the single lepton efficiency quoted above. The corresponding numbers for the combined rejection would be a rejection of about 28 for an efficiency of 61%.

These numbers can probably be considered as pessimistic and optimistic estimates for the impact parameter and isolation rejection in the three lepton case. From these crude extrapolations it seems to be possible to achieve a signal-to-background level which is comparable to the one achieved with the high lepton \(P_{T}\) cuts. In addition, both the impact parameter and the lepton isolation method can be combined with appropriate lepton cuts to improve the final signal significance. More detailed conclusions can only be drawn once full simulation results become available.

## 4 Expected signal and background rates

The hard lepton cuts (\(P_{T}^{0}=30\) GeV for all three leptons) and a jet veto cut of 30 GeV are used in the following to estimate the signal significance. The cross sections, signal acceptance, lepton reconstruction efficiencies and the expected rates for signal and background events are summarised in Table 6 for Higgs boson masses in the range between 150 and 190 GeV. The event numbers are given for an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\). For the cuts mentioned above, a total background of 23 events is found, which is dominated by the irreducible WZ and ZZ backgrounds. The \(t\overline{t}\) background is found to be at the level of 7.7 events and accounts therefore for about one third of the total background. Since no mass dependent cuts have been used, the background rates do not depend on the Higgs boson mass. The signal rate is largest for \(m_{H}=160\) GeV, for which 33.4 events are expected. Around this Higgs boson mass value a good signal-to-background ratio, together with a high signal significance can be reached.

The signal significance has been evaluated using Poisson statistics and assuming, as in the search for \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) decays, a systematic uncertainty of \(\pm 5\%\) on the total background. This uncertainty has been taken into account by evaluatingthe Poisson probabilities for a background expectation which is 5% higher than the nominal value. Due to the relatively small background, however, this systematic uncertainty does not degradate strongly the significance. A 5\(\sigma\) discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson in this channel seems to be possible in the mass range between \(\sim\)155 and \(\sim\)170 GeV, assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\). For an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\), this channel is still rate-limited. A signal significance at the level of 3\(\sigma\) is obtained only for \(m_{H}\) in the range between 160 and 170 GeV. This significance can only be slightly improved if during the low luminosity running a tighter jet veto cut of 15 GeV is used, since the remaining dominant WZ and ZZ backgrounds are not rejected strong enough by this cut. The corresponding numbers for the signal significance are included in Table 6.

It should be noted that the significances quoted here are slightly lower than the ones presented in the ATLAS Physics Performance Technical Design Report. The main reasons are the inclusion of both the \(\tau\) contributions and the significant ZZ background, which were not considered in Ref.[5]. In addition, a more reliable estimate of the \(t\overline{t}\) background has been performed using a high statistics sample of generated \(t\overline{t}\) events.

The signal significances are computed assuming a systematic uncertainty of \(\pm\)5% on the background and Poisson statistics._Transverse mass distribution

### Signal significance

As for \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\) decays, the transverse mass of the \(P_{T}^{miss}\) and dilepton system can be reconstructed and should contain information on the Higgs boson mass. In the present case there are however additional ambiguities given the presence of a third lepton. In addition, the \(P_{T}^{miss}\) is affected by the neutrino from the decay of the accompanying W boson which is produced in association with the Higgs boson.

The transverse mass has been calculated for those di-lepton pairs fulfilling the angular separation and di-lepton mass cuts from the \(H\to WW^{(*)}\) tag. Although the \(P_{T}^{miss}\) is affected by the decay neutrino from the associated W boson, the transverse mass distribution is still peaked in the mass range between 100 and 200 GeV. The transverse mass distribution for a Higgs boson signal of 160 GeV is shown in Fig.4 together with the corresponding distributions for the various background contributions. The distributions shown have been properly normalised, such that the expected numbers of events per 10 GeV are shown for an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\). For those cases where more than one \(H\to WW^{(*)}\) tag has been reconstructed, each solution has been filled into the transverse mass plot with a weight factor of \(1/N_{tags}\). A large fraction of the background, in particular of the \(ZZ\) background, is found at small transverse masses.

The transverse mass distribution of signal plus background is shown in Fig.5 for a Higgs boson mass of 160 GeV. The shape of the summed background is indicated by the shaded histogram and the dashed line, which represents a fit to the histogram.

The shape of the background is found to be rather flat, slightly falling off towards higher transverse masses. The signal shape shows a peak close to the nominal Higgs boson mass. This peak is also preserved for other Higgs boson masses, although the sensitivity of the shape of the transverse mass distribution to the Higgs boson mass decreases for higher masses. The corresponding distributions are shown in Fig. 6. The difference in shape between signal and background is much more pronounced in this case than in the case of the direct \(H\to WW^{(*)}\) decay channel. This feature is very helpful to extract a convincing signal in such a channel, where no direct mass peak can be reconstructed.

Given the shapes of the transverse mass distributions, the signal significance can still be slightly improved if an additional lower cut on the transverse mass is introduced. The optimal cut has been determined for each Higgs boson mass, by maximising the signal significance, and has been found to vary between 90 GeV for a Higgs boson mass of 150 GeV and 110 GeV for a Higgs boson mass of 190 GeV. However, since the significance is rather flat as a function of this cut, a transverse mass cut of 100 GeV has been used for all Higgs boson masses in the following. The corresponding results in terms of signal acceptance and efficiency and in terms of expected signal and background event numbers are given in Table 7 assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\). It is found that the significance and therefore the 5\(\sigma\) discovery window for a fixed integrated luminosity can be somewhat increased. Using a final transverse mass cut, a 5\(\sigma\) discovery of a Standard Model Higgs boson in this channel seems to be possible in the mass range between \(\sim\)155 and \(\sim\)175 GeV, assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\). If the ultimate LHC luminosity of 300 \(fb^{-1}\)can be reached, the Standard Model Higgs boson could be discovered with a significance exceeding the 5\(\sigma\) level over the mass range from 150 to \(\sim\)190 GeV.

### Determination of the Higgs boson mass

It has also been studied to what extent the transverse mass distribution can be used to determine the mass of the Higgs boson. A maximum likelihood estimator has been constructed [9], where first only the shape of the transverse mass distribution is used to determine the mass. The corresponding probability density functions are shown for Higgs boson masses of 150, 160 and 170 GeV in Fig. 7. Although the peak of the distribution shifts towards higher values of transverse mass with increasing Higgs boson mass, the shapes of the distributions are not very different.

If only the shape of the reconstructed transverse mass spectrum is used, the Higgs boson mass can be measured with a statistical uncertainty of \(\pm 4.2\) GeV for \(m_{H}=160\) GeV and assuming the statistics corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\)[9]. For higher masses this uncertainty increases since the leading edge of the transverse mass spectrum is smeared out more and more by the increasing momentum of the final state W's from the Higgs boson decay. For a Higgs boson mass of 175 GeV for example, the statistical error on the Higgs boson mass determination increases to \(\pm 5.2\) GeV assuming an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\).

Figure 7: _Probability density as a function of transverse mass for the sum of signal and background events. The densities are shown for three different Higgs boson masses, i.e. 150, 160 and 170 GeV._The systematic uncertainties have been estimated by increasing the number of background events by 20% and decreasing the number of signal events correspondingly. If in the mass reconstruction the same probability density functions as before are used, the systematic shift in the reconstructed mass is found to be small compared to the statistical error [9] resulting from the small signal sample.

If in addition to the shape of the distribution also the information on the observed event numbers is used in an extended likelihood [9], the precision on the mass determination increases. In this case the statistical errors are found to be \(\pm 2.7\) GeV for \(m_{H}=160\) GeV and \(\pm 3.4\) GeV for \(m_{H}=175\) GeV, if an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\) is assumed. This method can however only be applied if the signal and background rates are known with good precision.

For an ultimate integrated luminosity of 300 \(fb^{-1}\) the corresponding statistical errors, evaluated using the extended maximum likelihood method, reduce to \(\pm 1.2\) GeV for \(m_{H}=160\) GeV and to \(\pm 2.1\) GeV for \(m_{H}=175\) GeV.

## 6 Conclusions

The associated production channel \(WH\), with \(W\to l\nu\)and \(H\to WW^{(*)}\to l\nu l\nu\), provides an interesting possibility to enhance the observability of a Standard Model Higgs boson at the LHC in the intermediate mass range. For an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\) a signal with a significance of more than 5\(\sigma\) can be observed in the mass interval between 155 and 175 GeV. This mass window can be extended to cover the full range between 150 GeV and \(\sim\)190 GeV if the ultimate luminosity of 300 \(fb^{-1}\) can be reached. This channel therefore would complement a Higgs boson discovery in the \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\) and in the \(H\to WW^{*}\to l^{+}\nu l^{-}\nu\) channels and would add valuable information on the Higgs boson couplings to gauge bosons.

Compared to the \(WW^{*}\) channel, the associated production channel studied here has the advantage that the shapes of the reconstructed transverse mass distributions are different for signal and background. In addition, a better signal to background ratio can be reached. Both points are important for any signal claim based on an excess of events above the background. The signal significance is less sensitive to systematic uncertainties on the background.

The transverse mass spectrum provides also some information on the Higgs boson mass. From the shape of the measured transverse mass distribution the Higgs boson mass can be determined with a statistical uncertainty of the order of 4-5 GeV if an integrated luminosity of 100 \(fb^{-1}\) is accumulated.

As shown in the present analysis, the large reducible \(t\bar{t}\) background can be suppressed by using high cuts on the lepton \(P_{T}\) in conjunction with jet veto cuts. The signal significance might still be improved if impact parameter and stricter lepton isolation criteria are applied in addition. The \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\) production remain as dominant residual backgrounds.

The disadvantage of this channel compared to the \(WW^{*}\) channel is the rate limitation for low integrated luminosities. For an integrated luminosity of 30 \(fb^{-1}\), for example, only a 3\(\sigma\) effect might be observable if the Standard Model Higgs boson lies in the narrow mass range between 160 and 170 GeV. This rate limitation might be overcome if, in addition to the three lepton channel considered here, the \(WH\to WWW\to l^{\pm}l^{\pm}jj\) channel with like-sign leptons in the final state is considered. Although it suffers potentially from much larger backgrounds than the three lepton channel, it is considered as an interesting channel for Higgs boson searches at the upgraded TeVatron collider [10].
