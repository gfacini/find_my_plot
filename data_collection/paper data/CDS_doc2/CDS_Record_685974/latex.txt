Results are presented on the inclusive electron reconstruction efficiency and the QCD-jet rejection capability of the ATLAS calorimeter-inner tracker system, as a function of pseudorapidity. Simulated data samples of electrons including minimum bias pile-up, and 10\({}^{6}\) QCD-jets have been analysed. A jet rejection factor of \(\sim\)10\({}^{5}\) can be achieved for an overall electron efficiency of \(\sim\)65%, at a transverse momentum scale of 20 GeV.

Introduction

This article describes a simulation study of inclusive electron reconstruction efficiencies and the rejection capabilities against QCD-jets using the combined information of the calorimeter and inner tracker in the ATLAS detector, as a function of the pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)).

The motivation for requiring good electron identification efficiency and large rejection against QCD-jets has initially been described in Refs.[1-4], in the context of the specific physics signatures at the LHC. Subsequent studies have been performed in order to quantify the efficiency and rejection numbers for the different detector layouts proposed. These studies have been performed with limited statistics for the simulated jet background sample, and over a restricted pseudorapidity region [5,6]. It is worthwhile to recall, as stated in the ATLAS Letter of Intent [7], that in contrast to existing hadron colliders, where the isolated electron to jet ratio at a transverse momentum (p\({}_{\mathrm{{}_{T}}}\)) of order 40 GeV is about 10\({}^{\mathrm{-3}}\), this ratio is expected to be much lower at the LHC centre-of-mass energy, i.e. \(O(10^{\mathrm{-5}})\). Thus, in addition to the expected (electromagnetic) calorimeter rejection of hadronic jets, the inner tracking system must also provide a significant rejection factor against jets. The goal in the ATLAS detector, with a 2T magnetic field, is to be able to reduce the jet backgrounds to less than approximately 10% of the inclusive, isolated electron signal. A summary of the salient features of the present study, albeit preliminary, is described in the ATLAS Technical Proposal [8]. In this note, details are given of the simulated data samples used and the analysis strategy, as follows:

* Section 2 describes the data samples used for the electrons and the QCD-jets.
* Section 3 gives a description of the detector geometry used in the simulations, with particular emphasis on the inner tracker layout.
* Section 4 contains details of the analysis, in terms of the calorimeter selection and the track reconstruction criteria; as well as the results on the efficiencies for reconstructing electrons and rejection factors for the QCD-jets.
* Section 5 discusses the results and gives an outlook to the on-going and future studies, as suggested by the present analysis.
* Section 6 gives a summary of the principal results of this study.

### 2.0 Data Sets

The PYTHIA event generator (version 5.7) was used to generate the background data sample, which consisted mainly of di-jet events (referred to as QCD-jets), including initial and final state radiation processes. In addition to the events consisting of normal QCD-jet production, other physics processes such as prompt photon production, heavy quark production (including the top quark) and intermediate vector boson production were also included.

Table 1 gives a list of the main processes that were generated, along with the predicted cross-sections. These values correspond to a _hard-scattering_ cut of p\({}_{\mathrm{{}_{T}}}\)\(>\) 17 GeV and \(|\eta|<3\) for both jets in the generator. Additional details pertinent to the generation of the events and

the systematics involved can be found in Ref. [9]. The total generated sample comprised about \(5~{}\times~{}10^{5}\) events, where each event contained two jets with \(\rm p_{T}\) \(>\) 17 GeV within the acceptance of the detector.

The total summed cross section from the various subprocesses is 0.35 mb.

\end{table}
Table 1: **Generated parton subprocesses and corresponding cross sections for the jet sample.**Further selection criteria were applied to the above data sample at the level of the final state particles, in order to minimise the processing time required per event. For an event to be retained, at least one \(\eta\times\phi\) cone of size \(0.12\times 0.12\) was required to contain a total transverse energy \(\rm E_{\tau}>15\) GeV, summed over all stable particles except muons and neutrinos. The size of the cone and the transverse energy threshold were chosen so as not to bias the event sample near threshold. Approximately 30% of the generated events passed this particle-level filter.

After full GEANT simulation of the remaining generated events through the detector geometry described below in section 3, the standard _level-1_ trigger cuts for isolated electromagnetic (EM) clusters with \(\rm E_{\tau}>20\) GeV [6, 8] were applied in order to reduce the large amount of jet data to a manageable size for faster analysis. The efficiencies described in this note for single electrons do not include these _level-1_ trigger cuts.

The electron data sets consisted of approximately 2000 single electrons generated at a fixed \(\rm p_{T}\) of 20 GeV and 40 GeV over the same pseudorapidity interval as the jet sample.

In addition, the effect of pile-up, expected at high luminosity (i.e. \(\rm L=10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) sec\({}^{-1}\)) was simulated by superimposing the GEANT calorimeter and inner tracker hits from a sample of minimum bias events generated for this purpose, on those of the electron and jet events. Note, however, that for the present study the results quoted for the jet events do not include pile-up effects. The relevant characteristics of the minimum bias events are: \(\sim\) 6.5 charged tracks per unit of pseudorapidity with a mean \(\rm p_{T}\) of 0.55 GeV. The number of minimum bias events superimposed to a particular detector was determined on the basis of the electronics signal-shaping for each subdetector with respect to the nominal LHC bunch-crossing frequency of 40 MHz. This corresponded to the superposition of 36 events for the EM and hadronic calorimeters; 24 events for the transition radiation tracker; 18 events for the semiconductor trackers, and 24 events for the microstrip gas counters. 1

### Detector Geometry

The inner detector layout used in the present analysis is the so-called "Coseners House" layout [10]. A schematic diagram outlining its principal components is shown in Figure 1. Tracking information is provided by a combination of transition radiation tracker (TRT) straws, together with silicon strips and pixels in the barrel region, and microstrip gas counters (MSGCs), and gallium arsenide strips in the forward region.

One of the main objectives of the design is to provide, over \(|\eta|<2.5\), at least 6 space points from precision tracking detectors and \(\sim\)40 hits from the TRT straws. In order to handle the high radiation flux track density at the smaller radii, silicon pixel detectors and gallium arsenide strips are used. A uniform solenoidal magnetic field of 2 Tesla was simulated over the full tracker volume.

The barrel TRT is made up of 2 concentric cylinders of 4 mm diameter axial straws, interleaved with polypropylene low density foam radiator. The straw wires are divided into two at the centre and read out at both ends to reduce the straw occupancy. The TRT extends from an inner radius of 55 cm to an outer radius of 102 cm, and measures the r-\(\phi\) coordinate. Silicon strip detectors are located before, after and between the two TRT cylinders at radii of 52, 80, and 105 cm. Each of these detectors is composed of two layers, with \(~{}90^{\rm o}\) stereo angles and has a strip pitch of 200 \(\upmu\)m (1 mm) in r-\(\phi\) (z). Two further silicon strip layers are located at radii of 20 and 30 cm. These are made of \(\phi\)u stereo layers, with a stereo angle of 105 mrad and a strip pitch of 50 \(\upmu\)m. Finally, two layers composed of \(50\times 200~{}\upmu\)m\({}^{2}\) silicon pixels are located at radii of 11.5 and 14.5 cm, and extend over \(~{}|\eta|\)\(<\)1.5.

In the forward region, the TRT consists of 18 individual wheels per side, each containing radiator foils and radial straws. These wheels extend from an inner radius of 50 cm to an outer radius of 100 cm. The radial straw layout provides both \(\phi\) and z-information for reconstructed tracks. The basic component of the MSGC detector is a disc of 3 layers with keystone geometry. The three layers provide r-\(\phi\) and stereo information with uv\(\phi\) orientations and a stereo angle of \(\div\)9 mrad. Fourteen MSGC counters are positioned along the forward region, interleaved with the TRT wheels at smaller radii, where the counters extend between 40 and 50 cm, and larger radii where the counters extend between 84 and 100 cm. At each end larger structures consisting of 5 radial counters are used, covering the full radial extent between 40 and 100 cm. At smaller radii and closer to the event vertex, 4 gallium arsenide counters provide a high resolution hit capability. Each counter consists of radial strips with a \(uv\) stereo angle of \(~{}\div\)9 mrad and a strip pitch of 60 \(\upmu\)m.

The energy measurement of electrons is provided by a combined EM and hadronic calorimeter system. The EM calorimeter simulated in the present study is a liquid argon ionisation detector with lead-plate absorber material [7, 8]. The cell size is \(0.025\times 0.025\) in \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)

Figure 1: A schematic view of the Coseners House tracker layout. The envelope of the TRT is shown by the shaded enclosure.

It contains 3 samplings in depth plus a preshower section, giving a total thickness of 28 radiation lengths. An energy resolution of 10%/\(\sqrt{E}\)\(\oplus\) 0.7% (E in GeV units) is achieved over most of the \(\eta\)-coverage. At the transition between barrel and endcap regions, which occurs in the \(|\eta|\) range between 1.4 and 1.8, the resolution is degraded due to the presence of passive material. The energy deposition information in the compartments of the hadron calorimeter is used to veto against the QCD-jets.

The material distribution in the tracker is shown as a function of \(\eta\) in Figure 2. It is seen that the number of radiation lengths is fairly constant in the barrel region for \(|\eta|\)\(<\)0.9, with a mean value of \(\sim\) 0.3 radiation lengths. At larger \(\eta\), corresponding to the onset of the barrel-endcap transition region, the amount of material rapidly doubles, and by \(|\eta|\)\(\sim\)1.7 it has increased three-fold. In the endcap region, beyond \(|\eta|\)\(\sim\)1.8 the amount of material traversed rapidly falls and continues to reduce down to \(|\eta|\)\(\sim\)2.5. The average amount of material traversed is \(\sim\)0.5 radiation lengths.

### Event selection and analysis

The strategy employed to search for electron candidates, and hence reject QCD-jet background, should follow as closely as possible the expected procedure in the real experiment, including the trigger selection criteria. These are based on calorimeter information and track reconstruction, and are discussed in detail below.

Figure 2: The material distribution for the tracker layout.

### Calorimeter selection

After the filter cuts applied to emulate the _level-1_ trigger (see Section 2), there remain approximately 10,000 di-jet events. These events constitute the main background to the inclusive electron sample. They consist principally of jets with a large fraction of their energy carried by electromagnetically-showering particles, dominantly \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\)-mesons. Since the _level-1_ trigger cells do not use the full granularity of the EM calorimeter, these jets still contain a significant fraction of charged hadrons, and can be further rejected by _level-2_ trigger EM calorimeter cuts [8]. The algorithm used to reconstruct the energy of the electrons and photons in terms of the size and shape of the cluster cells, as well as the calibration procedure has been described elsewhere [11]. In the absence of tracker material, more than 95% of the shower energy would be contained in a calorimeter cluster of \(3\times 3\) cells, for the individual cell granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)= \(0.025\times 0.025\). However, photon conversions and electron bremsstrahlung in the tracker material tend to open the shower in \(\phi\), because of the 2T solenoidal field. Thus, in order to reduce the shower containment losses, a choice of asymmetric cluster shape has been adopted, that is larger in \(\phi\) than in \(\eta\). For typical values of the transverse energy (E\({}_{\rm T}\)) considered in this analysis, a cluster size of \(3\times 7\) cells in \(\eta\times\phi\) has been used. As an illustrative example, Figure 3 shows the ratio of the reconstructed energy to the generated energy (for electrons of p\({}_{\rm T}\) = 20 GeV) as a function of \(\eta\).

Approximate but not complete EM calorimeter calibration constants have been included in the reconstruction of the cluster energy [11]. The structure at \(|\eta|\sim 0.8\) is due to a change in the thickness of the lead absorber plates in the EM calorimeter. The loss of response in the region 1.4\(<\)\(|\eta|\)\(<\)1.8 is due to the transition between the barrel and the end-cap regions of the calorimeter. A further \(\eta\)-dependent correction factor has been applied to the reconstructed

Figure 3: Ratio of the calorimeter reconstructed (E\({}_{\rm r}\)) to the generated (E\({}_{\rm g}\)) energy for electrons.

cluster energies to equalise the response: this factor accounts for the incompleteness of the model used to obtain the calibration constants. These corrections amount, in the extreme case, to approximately 25%. Figure 4 shows the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) distribution, integrated over \(\eta\), of the combined EM calorimeter and preshower for (a) single electrons, (b) electrons with pile-up and, (c) QCD-jet events. These \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) distributions are plotted for all clusters with transverse energy above 5 GeV in the cell matrix used to seed the calorimeter reconstruction.

The electron sample quoted throughout this Section corresponds to events generated with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) = 20 GeV. The electron efficiencies quoted below with and without pile-up should therefore be considered as worst-case values. A Gaussian fit to the \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) distribution for the electron sample gives a value of \(\sigma\) approximately consistent with the resolution expected from the calorimeter [8, 11], even in the presence of minimum bias events, representing the pile-up effects at a luminosity of \(10^{34}\) cm-2 sec-1. The peak at \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) \(\sim\) 5 GeV in the distribution of figure 4(b) represents the tail of the energy deposited by particles in the EM calorimeter, due to the addition of minimum bias events, for the cluster size and \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) threshold considered. The energy resolution is degraded by approximately 8% because of the pile-up. For the jet sample, the "shoulder" at 15 GeV in the transverse energy distribution is due to the particle-level selection criteria described in Section 2.

Figure 4: The EM calorimeter \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) distribution for (a) electrons, (b) electrons + pile-up, and (c) jets.

The transverse energy of the reconstructed EM cluster with highest \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) is required to be larger than 17 GeV; this cut has an efficiency of \(96.7\pm 0.4\,\%\) (\(98.1\pm 0.3\)) % for the single electrons (electrons with pile-up).

After the EM calorimeter transverse energy cut, additional selection cuts are applied to the clusters to further suppress the backgrounds, while maintaining high efficiency for the electrons. For these calorimeter selection criteria, the distributions shown in the subsequent figures are also integrated over the pseudorapidity coverage of the detector. The individual efficiencies indicated on the figures are after the transverse energy cut described above.

### Hadronic energy leakage and isolation cut

#### 4.2.1 Hadronic energy leakage

Figure 5 shows the distribution of \(\mathrm{E_{T}}\) in the hadronic calorimeter cluster of \(2\times 2\) cells in \(\eta\times\phi\) space directly behind the EM cluster, where each cell has a granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)=\(0.08\times 0.08\). As expected, the distribution for the QCD-jet events shows a broad distribution arising from the energy deposited by the high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) hadrons. Note the large fraction of entries in the overflow on the scale of the plot, as compared to the electron event sample. The tail in the distribution for electrons with pile-up also arises from depositing energy near the EM cluster. The events are required to satisfy \(\mathrm{E_{(Had.\ leak.)}<0.5}\) GeV. This gives an efficiency of \(95.5\pm 0.5\,\%\) for the electron sample with pile-up.

Figure 5: **The distribution of the hadronic transverse energy for (a) electrons, (b) electrons + pile-up, and (c) jets.**

#### 4.2.2 EM calorimeter isolation

As a final isolation cut, the amount of energy deposited in a larger cluster of EM cells surrounding the \(3\times 7\)  cluster is used. A ratio, R, is defined as the fraction of energy contained in the \(3\times 7\)  cell, with respect to a larger \(7\times 7\)  cell in \(\eta\times\phi\)  space: R=1-[E\({}_{\rm T}\) (\(3\times 7\)) /E\({}_{\rm T}\) (\(7\times 7\)) ]. The distribution of R is shown in Figure 6. A cut requiring R\(<\)10% yields an efficiency of \(97.6\pm\ 0.3\%\) (\(92.5\pm\ 0.6\))% for electrons (electrons with pile-up).

Figure 6: The EM energy isolation fraction for (a) electrons, (b) electrons + pile-up, and (c) jets.

### Preshower profile

The final calorimeter selection uses the information from the preshower, which was subdivided into two layers (\(\phi\) and \(\eta\) strips) in front of the active calorimeter. This layout was also called the RD3-preshower. Due to magnetic field effects in the \(\phi\)-direction, only the \(\eta\)-information was used here.

The preshower \(\eta\)-profile was defined as the fraction of energy measured in the two highest-energy strips with respect to the total energy of the 16 core strips. Figure 7 shows the distribution of this fraction for the different event samples. The selection cut requires it to be larger than 40%, which has an efficiency of \(\sim\)99% for electrons with or without pile-up, and an efficiency of \(\sim\)82% for jets. Entries in Figure 7 with a value of the fraction equal to zero correspond to showers outside the fiducial coverage of the preshower (\(|\eta|>2.3\)), for which the cut is not applied. Entries in overflow in Figure 7 correspond to showers for which the energy in the preshower strips was below the noise threshold. Although its rejection against jets is not large, this cut was retained as the final one in the sequence of so-called _level-2_ calorimeter cuts for consistency with other analyses (photon reconstruction studies and trigger studies).

### Overall efficiency and rejection of calorimeter selection

Table 2 gives a summary of the efficiencies for electrons with \(\mathrm{p_{T}=20~{}GeV}\) and the rejection factors for jets, after the calorimeter selection criteria. The results are shown for the three canonical intervals in \(\eta\) used in the analysis. As already discussed the electron efficiencies do not include the effect of the _level-1_ trigger cuts. On the other hand, the jet rejection factors do include the effect of these cuts, since the jets passing the calorimeter selection are normalised to the number of generated jets.

As expected from previous studies, the rejection factor against QCD-jets is \(\sim O(10^{3})\) after all calorimeter cuts.

The electron efficiencies for the calorimeter selection criteria have also been calculated for the event sample at \(\mathrm{p_{T}=40~{}GeV}\), and are listed in Table 3.

The efficiency for electrons at \(\mathrm{p_{T}=40~{}GeV}\), averaged over \(\eta\) is, as expected, higher than for electrons at \(\mathrm{p_{T}=20~{}GeV}\).

The efficiency in the \(\eta\) interval 1.4 - 2.5 is significantly lower than in the other regions. This is due to the transition from the barrel to the end-cap region in the calorimeter design, because no fiducial cuts have been applied to the data sets. The majority of the loss in efficiency is actually due to a rather restricted interval in \(\eta\), close to the transition region, as illustrated in Table 4. Although this was not done in the present study, the calorimeter cuts could be tuned to provide uniform electron efficiency over \(\eta\), even at the expense of a possibly worse jet rejection in the barrel/end-cap transition region. The jet rejection in the end-cap is larger than that of the barrel region due to an enhanced EM calorimeter rejection, since the average energy of jets is larger in the end-cap.

### Track reconstruction and selection

The selection criteria based on the calorimeter information of the preceding section are necessary to select an EM cluster. These criteria, however, do not sufficiently reduce the jet backgrounds. Further reduction of the backgrounds can be achieved by using pattern recognition and track reconstruction algorithms, which require the presence of a charged track pointing to the EM cluster position, with a reconstructed track momentum consistent with the measured energy.

For this study, two track reconstruction packages have been used on the electron and jet events. In both packages, track finding is restricted to regions of interest connecting the beam intersection envelope to each retained calorimeter cluster. The found tracks are expressed in terms of vertex-constrained helix parameters at the closest approach to the beam-spot. In the present analysis there was no explicit search for secondary vertices.

In view of the large material thickness traversed (as already illustrated in figure 2), electrons frequently deviate from an ideal helical trajectory due to bremsstrahlung radiation. Hence, a bremsstrahlung recovery procedure has been developed which takes into account the extrapolated track deviation from the calorimeter cluster centroid. It has been incorporated into the reconstruction packages [5, 6].

For the initial investigation, an algorithm starting from the transition radiation tracker, referred to as IRECON[6] in the ATLAS reconstruction package [12] was used. For the QCD-jet events, the IRECON code reconstructs a single track, corresponding to the track with the highest \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) facing the EM calorimeter cluster, and therefore no information on the multiplicity of the tracks associated to the cluster is available.

The second reconstruction package, called IPATREC[13], initiates track-finding from space-points in the discrete tracker. It is designed to exploit the superior two-track resolution and relatively low occupancy of the precision tracking layers to reconstruct tracks above a \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) threshold which lie in the region of interest. Tracks are required to originate in the vicinity of the primary vertex by demanding at least one hit in the innermost two layers. For the present data sets the information from the TRT is not used.

A third track reconstruction package referred to as XKALMAN is also being used to study the event samples, and the results will be published as an addendum to this note.

In the following, the results in terms of electron efficiency and jet rejection will be shown in some detail for each of the algorithms. IRECON was constructed as a package to fit tracks in a well-defined road and was not meant to handle multiple tracks. Therefore, IRECON results will only be shown for electrons without pile-up, whereas IPATREC results will be shown for electrons with and without pile-up.

In order to compare the results from both procedures, similar selection cuts were applied in the same sequence: first a high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) track was required with some minimal quality criteria; then its momentum was compared to the calorimeter energy before and after bremsstrahlung recovery. Results are shown for the three \(\eta\)-ranges discussed in the previous Section. It should be stressed that the \(\eta\)-ranges do not correspond to those one would choose to study the performance of the tracking system as a function of its geometry. The \(\eta\)-range, 0\(<\)\(|\eta|\)\(<\)0.7, matches well the barrel tracker, both for the TRT and the precision trackers. The second \(\eta\)-range, 0.7\(<\)\(|\eta|\)\(<\)1.4, covers the end of the barrel tracker (axial straws and cylindrical precision tracker layers), and most of the transition to the forward tracker region (radial wheels and counters). The third \(\eta\)-range, 1.4\(<\)\(|\eta|\)\(<\)2.5, covers the forward region with full radial track length up to \(|\eta|\)\(\sim\)1.8. It also contains a more difficult region at high \(\eta\), where the tracker momentum resolution is degraded and the number of TRT hits decreases.

#### 4.5.1 Results from IRECON

IRECON first searches for a TRT track segment with \(\rm p_{T}>7\) GeV. This cut emulates the _level-2_ TRT track trigger requirement, with a threshold chosen to minimize losses due to electron bremsstrahlung in the precision tracker layers, while preserving adequate rejection against jets in the presence of pile-up [14]. Figure 8 shows the distribution of \(\rm p_{T}{}^{TRT}\) for the electron and jet samples in the three \(\eta\)-intervals. The electrons display a peak at 20 GeV with low-\(\rm p_{T}\) tails due to bremsstrahlung which reflect the material distribution of Figure 2. The efficiency of this _level-2_\(\rm p_{T}\) cut is about 90%.

Quality criteria, based on the number of hits present on a track both from the TRT and the precision tracker devices, are used to further distinguish between the electron tracks and the particles in the jet. The distributions of the TRT hits and silicon/MSGC hits are shown in Figures 9 and 10 for tracks with \(\rm P_{T}{}^{TRT}>7\) GeV. For the TRT hits, a cut is placed on the number of points present on a track, depending on the \(\eta\)-range: a minimum of 24 hits are required for \(0<|\eta|<0.7\); 14 hits for \(0.7<|\eta|<1.4\) and 20 hits for \(1.4<|\eta|<2.5\). For the precision trackers, the minimum number of single layer hits is 4 over the entire pseudorapidity range.

A final track selection requires the reconstructed track momentum to match the EM calorimeter cluster energy. The distribution of E/p for the electron sample and the jet events is shown in Figure 11 (without the bremsstrahlung fit) and in Figure 12 (with the bremsstrahlung fit), for the three \(\eta\)-intervals.

#### 4.5.2 Results from IPATREC

The IPATREC version used for this analysis was taken from the "95-6" Atlas Software release, with the default values retained for track-finding criteria. Namely, the tracks were required to have at least one hit in the innermost two layers, to impact within a \(3\times 7\) window about the calorimeter cluster and to have \(\rm p_{T}>2\) GeV. Furthermore, a helix fit through the outer track segment was required to have a fit \(\chi^{2}\) / degree of freedom (NDF) \(<4\), and a similar requirement was imposed on the hits associated from the innermost 3 tracking layers. A final requirement was for greater than 5 hit strips plus pixels, with an additional cut if too many expected hits were missing from the intersected detectors. No additional quality cut to the overall track fit was applied since substantial \(\chi^{2}\) tails arise from bremsstrahlung effects. A second track-fit included the calorimeter centroid as a measurement to represent the quality of the track-calorimeter position match. This fit allows for a single discrete increase in curvature to represent a possible hard bremsstrahlung in the case when this is significant.

The accepted tracks were ordered such that higher quality tracks appear first (corresponding to those with more associated hits, less missing hits and a low fit \(\chi^{2}\)). The highest-\(\rm p_{T}\) track is not necessarily the first. A feature of the jets passing the _level-2_ calorimeter cuts is the low track multiplicity found in the road. Approximately 60% of the jets had no track satisfying the above criteria.

Electron selection is performed using analogous cuts to those made in the preceding section. Firstly, the reconstructed transverse momentum of the vertex-constrained track (\(\rm p_{T}{}^{\rm vert.}\)) is required to be greater than 10 GeV, corresponding to the discrete tracker _level-2_ trigger threshold described in reference [15]. The \(\rm p_{T}\) distribution is shown in Figure 13 for the electron and jet events.

Next, a rather loose quality cut is placed on the track fit including the calorimeter position, requiring \(\chi^{2}/\) number of degrees of freedom \(<15\). The distribution of this quality criterion is shown for the three \(\eta\)-intervals in Figure 14 for the electron and jet event samples.

Figure 19: The E/p distributions for electrons + pile-up before bremsstrahlung recovery.

A summary of the efficiencies obtained, using IPATREC, are shown in Table 6 (Table 7) for the single electrons (electrons with pile-up) with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}=20\) GeV.

The values for the electron efficiencies, as a function of the pseudorapidity, are compatible between the IRECON and IPATREC track reconstruction algorithms in the absence of pile-up. However, it should be noted that since IRECON tracks are on average formed from hits at radii larger than for IPATREC tracks (use or not of TRT information), the proportion of

hits affected by bremsstrahlung in the traversed material with IPATREC is less than that for the majority of hits used by IRECON. Thus, the efficiency of the E/p cut (before and after bremsstrahlung recovery) for electron tracks passing the IRECON selection cuts is lower by ~3-5% than for IPATREC.

There is a significant loss in the overall electron reconstruction efficiency in the presence of pile-up from the addition of minimum bias events, as seen from the values obtained using IPATREC. It is expected that with more work on the reconstruction software most of this loss will be recovered.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:27]

After the calorimeter selection, the dominant background consists of photons from \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) decays. This is significantly reduced by requiring the presence of a high-p\({}_{\rm T}\) track. After all selection criteria, however, the signal-to-background ratio is still \(\sim\)1:2, while achieving a rejection factor of \(\sim\)\(2\times 10^{4}\) against the QCD jets. Note that the signal is predominantly from \(b\to e\) semi-electronic decays, and that the signal-to-background ratio is worse than 1:2 for isolated electrons from W,Z decays (see Section 5).

Independent studies using a prototype transition radiation detector (TRD) in a test beam have achieved the expected figures for the separation of hadrons from electrons, using the transition radiation signal. A reduction factor of 10 (50) against hadrons at high (low) luminosity has been obtained. Likewise, a pattern recognition algorithm based on the TRT, using partner identification of photon conversion pairs created in the inner tracker provides a further possibility to reject such events. A rejection of 15 against the currently observed conversion background can be achieved. The efficiency for electrons is calculated to be \(\sim\)90% for cuts against both backgrounds [16].

Table 9 gives a summary of the rates and rejection factors which would be obtained after applying the above criteria. Using a rejection factor of 10 against charged hadrons and 15 against conversions, the signal-to-background ratio becomes \(\sim\) 6:1; with an overall electron reconstruction efficiency of \(\sim 65.2\pm 1.0\) %, in the absence of pile-up from minimum bias

If the electron signal is restricted to that from W/Z decays, then the signal to background ratio drops from 6:1 to \(\sim\)1:1 (see Section 5).

It should be emphasised that the above values for the electron reconstruction efficiency and jet rejection correspond to the performance of the combined calorimeter-tracker system very close to the trigger threshold. Moreover, the tracker layout in the present study contains significantly more material than the layout chosen for the Technical Proposal. The electron efficiency of \(\sim\) 65% at 20 GeV increases to \(\sim\)74% for electrons of 40 GeV. Also it has been shown that the rejection against jets increases by about a factor of 2 from 20 to 40 GeV.

### Systematic uncertainties

The errors quoted above for the electron efficiencies and jet rejections are purely statistical. Obviously the question of systematic uncertainties arises when studying the "electron-like" content of jets at the level of 10\({}^{\text{-}5}\) to 10\({}^{\text{-}6}\) of the jet cross-section. There are many sources of such uncertainties:

* cross-sections for jet production and heavy flavour content of jets, and overall inclusive isolated electron cross-sections;
* jet fragmentation into leading \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) mesons or charged pions;
* detector model (material thickness, material types) and simulation (GEANT, magnetic field, detector response).

The overall systematic uncertainty on the expected signal-to-background ratio is at least a factor of 2 if the signal is restricted to electrons from W/Z decays and much more (i.e. a factor \(\sim\)5) if electrons from b-decay are included.

### Interpretation and discussion of results

A sample of 99 EM clusters as selected by one or other of the analysis programs, out of the total sample of 10\({}^{6}\) generated QCD-jets survive the calorimeter and tracking selection criteria described in section 4. In this section, an attempt is made to understand the nature of these clusters and to ascertain how they have satisfied the electron selection criteria. As described previously, the two track reconstruction programs, IRECON and IPATREC have been used. Here, an attempt is made to use the combined information from the two sets of results, in order to understand the underlying phenomena, independently of the specific algorithms employed. So as to remain consistent with the preceding section, the resulting clusters are classified according to the particle type with the highest \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) in the respective cluster, namely electron, photon conversion and charged hadron. Other particles are often associated to the cluster, but by definition have a lower \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\). The numbers discussed in this section do not include the additional rejection factors anticipated from the use of transition radiation against charged hadrons or electron partner searches against photon conversions.

### Electron candidates

Electrons are produced at the event vertex both singly in semi-electronic decays of heavy quarks and W bosons, and in pairs from the decays of J/\(\psi\) mesons and \(Z^{0}\) bosons. These are _signal_ candidates, and as such should be reconstructed with high detection efficiency provided they are isolated. Another source of electron pairs originating at the vertex, which constitute a potential background, is the Dalitz decay of \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) mesons. A summary of the origin of the electron candidates selected in the jet sample after all cuts, is shown in Table 10. The sample contains 24 events selected by both IRECON and IPATREC, and 7 events by only one of them.

These electron candidates uniformly populate the three \(\eta\)-regions, except perhaps at high rapidity, where the efficiency is reduced due to the calorimeter crack and increased tracker

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\eta\)**range:** & **0.0 - 0.7** & **0.7 - 1.4** & **1.4 - 2.5** & **All** \\ \hline \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{_Signal:_} \\ \hline B,D mesons & 6 (6/6) & 8 (9/8) & 4 (5/4) & 18 (20/18) \\ \hline W bosons & 1 (1/1) & 0 (0/0) & 1 (2/2) & 2 (3/3) \\ \hline J/\(\psi\) mesons & 1 (1/1) & 0 (0/0) & 0 (1/0) & 1 (2/1) \\ \hline Z bosons & 1 (1/1) & 1 (1/1) & 0 (0/0) & 2 (2/2) \\ \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{_Background:_} \\ \hline Dalitz decays & 0 (1/0) & 1 (1/1) & 0 (1/0) & 1 (3/1) \\ \hline \multicolumn{5}{|c|}{_Total:_} \\ \hline  & 9 (10/9) & 10 (11/10) & 5 (9/6) & 24 (30/25) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The numbers in brackets denote the candidates found by each program separately (IRECON/IPATREC).**material. The 22 electrons from heavy flavour decay correspond only to a small fraction of the generated electrons from such decays, since they are not in general isolated. Previous studies [6] indicate that this fraction is \(\sim\)15%. Only 6 of the candidate electrons are from W/Z decays. A further sample of 3 candidates are background electrons originating from Dalitz decays. Apart from the fact that they originate at the primary vertex, these can be considered as similar to the conversion backgrounds (see section 5.2). It is clear that more work is required to understand the less than perfect overlap between IRECON and IPATREC for the electron signal events. In contrast, this overlap is much higher, \(\sim\)93%, for single electrons.

### Photon conversion candidates

For the jet sample, the information from tracks originating from photon conversions and secondary interactions was not available, and so by definition, this class contains clusters where the highest \(\rm p_{T}\) particle associated to the cluster is a photon. In many cases these jets will contain a photon conversion, since a good electron candidate is reconstructed by the calorimeter and track selection. However, in some cases, the jet does not clearly correspond to a clean photon conversion and therefore sub-categories have been defined depending on the nature of the second highest \(\rm p_{T}\) particle if any:

(a) single photon candidates; (b) isolated \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) candidates, where the two highest \(\rm p_{T}\) particles are photons from the same \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) decay; (c) non-isolated \(\pi^{0}/\eta\) candidates, where the second highest \(\rm p_{T}\) particle is a photon, but not from the same parent as the first one; and (d) mixed clusters, where the second highest \(\rm p_{T}\) particle is a charged hadron.

Table 11 gives the breakdown of the 41 photon conversion candidates, into the four sub-categories and three \(\eta\)-intervals.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\eta\)**range:** & **0.0 - 0.7** & **0.7 - 1.4** & **1.4 - 2.5** & **All** \\ \hline \hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\(\gamma+\gamma\)_from \(\pi^{0}/\eta\)_:} \\ \hline  & 0 (3/1) & 0 (3/6) & 2 (5/7) & 2 (11/14) \\ \hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\(\gamma+\)_charged hadron:_} \\ \hline  & 0 (4/0) & 2 (5/4) & 0 (2/1) & 2 (11/5) \\ \hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{\(\gamma+\)_(\(\gamma\)) not from \(\pi^{0}/\eta\)_:} \\ \hline  & 0 (0/0) & 0 (1/1) & 0 (2/0) & 0 (3/1) \\ \hline \multicolumn{4}{|c|}{_Total:_} \\ \hline  & 0 (7/1) & 2 (9/11) & 2 (9/8) & 4 (25/20) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 11: **The number of photon conversion candidates in the jet sample found by both track reconstruction programs. The numbers in brackets denote the candidates found by each program separately (IRECON/IPATREC).**In all the cases, it is the electrons from the photon conversions which are detected, and so the number of these clusters should be proportional to the amount of material traversed by the photons. It is clearly visible from the table that the number of such clusters more than doubles in the overlap and forward regions, which is consistent with the increase in the inner tracker material, expected from figure 2.

These types of clusters pose a challenge to the existing track reconstruction algorithms as illustrated in Table 11 by the fact that only \(\sim\)10% of the events are in common between the two track finding algorithms. Consequently, an objective and quantitative estimate of the rejection of such events will require much more detailed work, including the development of specific algorithms to identify this type of background.

As a first general remark, it may be noted that, in the absence of explicit requirements on the number of hits found in the innermost tracking layers, the IRECON algorithm should find more photon conversions than the IPATREC one, since it selects tracks with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}^{\mathrm{TRT}}>7\) GeV and a minimum of 4 hits in the precision tracker layers\({}^{2}\). Thus, conversions occurring in the last precision tracker layers may be reconstructed by IRECON but not by IPATREC.

As a second remark, the photon conversions remaining after the E/p cut clearly must be rather asymmetric, resulting in partner electrons with low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\). With IPATREC (which attempts to reconstruct all tracks with \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>2\) GeV), 12 out of the 20 clusters in this class contain a second reconstructed track with opposite sign to the first. Neither tracking algorithm has yet been fully tuned to reject these conversions; for example a substantially lower threshold is desirable for partner searches. Opposite sign partner searches have been made down to \(\mathrm{p_{T}}>0.5\) GeV using the TRT stand-alone pattern recognition [16]. Further studies with photon conversions from \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) decays and with \(\pi^{0}\)/\(\eta\) Dalitz decays are in progress.

2) If the condition on the minimum number of hits required to be present in the precision tracker layers is increased from 4 to 8, it is observed that the number of photon conversion candidates is reduced by a factor of \(\sim\)2, whilst approximately only 13% of the electron candidates are lost.

### Charged hadron candidates

This last class contains events for which the highest \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) particle associated to the calorimeter cluster is a charged hadron. There are a total of 27 such clusters (Table 12) selected by the programs, out of which 18 are accepted by both and 9 by only one. In the common sample, 16 clusters contain a charged pion, and 2 have a charged kaon as the hadron with the leading \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\).

In all 27 cases the true hadron \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) is greater than 70% of the observed calorimeter transverse energy, thus the events should satisfy the selection criteria after reconstruction. These events are not inconsistent in rate with a charge exchange interaction in the material between the outer tracking and early calorimeter layers. In such a reaction most of the incoming hadron's energy is transferred to leading \(\mathrm{\pi^{0}}\)'s which then deposit their energy in the EM calorimeter.

Note that although most of these hadrons were produced with several accompanying low \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) particles, almost all of these particles take less than 10% of the leading hadron momentum. In each case there remains just one charged track associated to the calorimeter cluster. The transition radiation function of the TRT is expected to be effective against this type of background, which is of the same order as the electron signal at LHC.

### Summary

A study has been presented on the inclusive electron reconstruction efficiency and QCD-jet rejection capability in the ATLAS apparatus, at a transverse momentum scale of 20 GeV.

Using calorimeter information alone, an overall jet rejection factor of \(\sim\)10\({}^{3}\) has been obtained for an electron efficiency of \(\sim\)90% at high luminosity. The addition of track selection and E/p match to the calorimeter cluster improves this jet rejection to \(\sim\)2\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\) for an overall electron efficiency of 72-75%. This electron efficiency is quoted at threshold, i.e. for \(\mathrm{p_{T}}=20\) GeV, and is \(\mathrm{\eta}\)-dependent. The efficiency is strongly correlated to the amount of material traversed which is significantly higher in the Coseners House tracker layout studied here than for the layout described in the Technical Proposal; it should therefore be considered as a conservative lower limit.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(\mathrm{\eta}\)**range:** & **0.0 - 0.7** & **0.7 - 1.4** & **1.4 - 2.5** & **All** \\ \hline \hline  & 7 (7/9) & 7 (7/12) & 4 (4/6) & 18 (18/27) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 12: **The number of charged hadron candidates in the jet sample by both track reconstruction programs. The numbers in brackets denote the candidates found by each program separately (IRECON/IPATREC).**At this level of cuts, the residual events in the jet sample consist of electrons (mostly signal processes), photon conversions and charged hadrons in approximately equal quantities. The signal-to-background is ~1:2 for all electrons and only ~1:10 for isolated electrons from W/Z decays. Further selection cuts, exploiting partner searches to reject photon conversions and Dalitz decays as well as the transition radiation functionality of the TRT, lead to an ultimate jet rejection in excess of 10\({}^{5}\) for an overall electron efficiency of ~65%.

Within the presently available statistical and systematic uncertainties, the inclusive electron signal above 20 GeV p\({}_{\rm T}\) can be identified using the full functionality of the ATLAS detectors with residual jet backgrounds of ~15% for all electrons, to ~100% for isolated electrons from W/Z decays.

In order to reach a better understanding of the ATLAS detector potential in this important field, a new jet sample comprising ~10\({}^{7}\) QCD-jets simulated through the most up-to-date geometry of the ATLAS detector is eagerly awaited.
