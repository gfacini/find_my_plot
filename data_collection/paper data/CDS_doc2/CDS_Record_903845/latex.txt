**Abstract**

The potential of the ATLAS detector at the LHC to detect and quantify the production of gluino \(R\)-hadrons is investigated. Using QCD-based models and a full detector simulation, a search strategy is outlined which uses the property that gluino \(R\)-hadrons can change the sign of their charge when propagating through matter. By comparing charged tracks in the Inner and Muon tracking systems, it is shown that this observable can be used to both detect and identify gluino \(R\)-hadrons of masses up to around \(1\) TeV in early LHC running.

Introduction

It is well known that the Standard Model (SM) [1] of particle physics is an incomplete theory. Problems with the SM include the unnatural fine tuning of the Higgs mass, non-unification of the gauge couplings at high energy, and the absence of a candidate for dark matter. Candidate theories, such as those based on Supersymmetry [2] (SUSY), are able to address the deficiencies of the SM and predict the existence of hitherto unobserved particles with masses around the TeV scale. The direct production of such particles should be possible at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) [3], at which beams of protons will be collided at 14 TeV centre-of-mass energy. One of the primary tasks of the ATLAS [4] experiment at the LHC will be to search for and measure the properties of any new particles. Given the inherent uncertainties in the phenomenology of exotic theories, it is appropriate in early LHC running to study experimental quantities which provide maximum discrimination between the different scenarios and minimum dependence on the minutiae of any given model. One important observable of any search for and quantification of new physics processes is the presence (or absence) of charged, massive, stable1 particles (CMSPs). CMSPs can propagate through the entire detector like a muon. A variety of CMSPs with different quantum numbers and properties are features of many exotic scenarios. It is therefore imperative to not only devise search strategies to observe CMSPs, but also to quantify their quantum numbers in order to distinguish between the scenarios and probe the underlying physics mechanisms. This paper outlines a generic strategy for the detection and identification of massive, long-lived colour octet particles. This is used to evaluate the potential of the ATLAS experiment for discovering stable gluinos, pair produced within a Split-SUSY [6, 7, 8] scenario.

Footnote 1: The term stable is used to refer to particles which will not decay during their passage through a detector.

Split-SUSY is a relatively recent Supersymmetry model. Within this approach, the hierarchy problem and the fine-tuning of the Higgs mass is accepted, or assumed to be set by another, as yet, unknown mechanism. SUSY is still necessary to unify the gauge couplings, but by accepting the fine-tuning of the Higgs mass, Split-SUSY proposes a way to break the symmetry at scale above \(1000\) TeV. The scalar particles, except for a single neutral Higgs boson acquire masses at this high scale. Chiral symmetries assure that the fermions possess masses around the TeV scale. Split-SUSY still provides a dark matter candidate and, furthermore, possesses none of the difficulties in describing electric dipole moments [9, 10], flavour changing neutral currents [11] which challenge the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model [2]. A further consequence of Split-SUSY is that the gluino can then become meta-stable since its decay must involve a virtual squark and is therefore suppressed. For values of squark masses above \(10^{6}\) GeV, the gluino will form a hadronic bound state (known as a so-called \(R_{\tilde{g}}\) hadron) 2 which is sufficiently stable so as to propagate through the ATLAS detector.

Footnote 2: In this paper, the term \(R\)-hadron refers to an exotic hadron containing an unspecified sparticle, while the terms R\({}_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron and R\({}_{\tilde{q}}\)-hadron refer to particles containing a gluino and squark, respectively.

Split-SUSY is not the only SUSY scenario predicting CMSPs. Stable gluinos are also considered in other SUSY scenarios [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17] including Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB) [2, 15]. Furthermore, within GMSB scenarios, stops and staus as third generation SUSY partners, may be the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particles and stable [18, 19]. The stop can also be long-lived within 5-Dimensional Supersymmetry [20].

CMSPs are also predicted in a number of alternative exotic scenarios. Theories of leptoquarks [21], Universal Extra Dimensions [22], certain unification models [23], and theorieswhich postulate new SM fermions [24, 25, 26] all admit new heavy hadrons. The possible existence of Dirac Monopoles [27] remains an open question to be addressed at the LHC [28].

Searches for CMSPs have taken place at many accelerators [29, 30, 31, 32]. At the end of Run II at the Tevatron lower mass limits on \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons of between around \(200\) and \(400\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) can be expected [33]. In this work, the potential of the ATLAS detector to detect R\({}_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons during early LHC running, corresponding to integrated luminosity of \(2\)fb\({}^{-1}\). At least this amount of luminosity should be achieved in the first two years of running. The search strategy exploits the hadronic interactions of R\({}_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons. Since a gluino is a colour octet, then a \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron formed from a gluino can reverse the sign of its charge whilst undergoing nuclear scattering in a calorimeter (so-called charge reversal) [34, 35, 36]. This signature is exploited in the search strategy outlined in this paper. Since a stable \(\tilde{\tau}\), or a \(R_{\tilde{t}}\)-hadron cannot undergo charge reversal, the observation of charge reversal can be used as a detection tool and discriminant between exotic scenarios [19, 37].

Recent studies [38, 33, 39] have investigated the discovery potential of the LHC experiments for \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons produced in a Split-SUSY scenario. These indicate that a discovery could be made in early LHC running, with accummulated luminosity of around \(2\)fb\({}^{-1}\), for masses of up to \(1.5\) TeV. Most of these works used a simple parameterised simulation for a detector response. However, a full simulation of the ATLAS Muon Spectrometer, and a parameterised simulation of the whole ATLAS detector based on the \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron scattering model used in this work, was performed in [38].

However, none of the search strategies which were considered would be able to identify an \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron as being gluonic, and thus distinguish it from a \(R_{\tilde{q}}\)-hadron. This work uses a full simulation of the whole ATLAS detector and outlines a complementary search strategy, through which both the discovery of a \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron and the quantification of its colour charge could simultaneously be made.

## 2 Simulation of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons and backgrounds

### Cross-Section Prediction

Hard scattering events for \(pp\) interactions are simulated using the leading order generator

Pythia/Jetset 6.3[40]. The effects of initial and final state QCD radiation are described in Pythia by leading logarithm parton showers. In Pythia the fragmentation of partons into hadrons follows the Lund string model [41].

Pythia can be used to determine the cross-section at leading order for the production of gluinos and for background processes considered in this work. For this analysis we have used the next-to-leading order program Prospino[42] for the gluino pair-production cross-section calculation and have reweighted the Pythia simulated event sample to match the Prospino predictions.

Following the work in [38], a simple Split-SUSY scenario was used to determine the parameter space, with the squarks assigned a mass of \(10^{4}\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\). The other non-gluino sparticleswere also assumed to possess this mass. Varying the Split-SUSY parameter space of non-gluino sparticle masses over many orders of magnitude leads to changes in the cross-section of around \(20\%\)[33, 39]. Events with gluino masses of \(300\), \(500\), \(1000\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) were simulated, and the gluino was set to be absolutely stable.

The cross-section for gluino pair production, as determined by Prospino, is shown in Fig. 1 as a function of the gluino mass. The predictions are shown at next-to-leading order for different choices of parton density functions (pdfs): Cteq5m[43] and Mrst[44]. The renormalisation and factorisation scales were set to the gluino mass \(m_{\tilde{g}}\). As can be seen, the cross-section falls very steeply. For one year of low luminosity running at the LHC, corresponding to 2fb\({}^{-1}\) of luminosity, approximately \(1\)M and \(500\) gluino-pair events would be expected for gluino masses of \(300\) and \(1000\) GeV, respectively.

For mass values below \(500\) GeV, the NLO cross-section is around 15% higher for the Cteq5m set than for the Mrst set. At values of mass around 1000 GeV, the difference grows to \(\sim\)30%. The Mrst set was chosen for this study in order to have a conservative estimate of gluino production rates.

Simulated samples consisting of around 75,000, 26,000, and 5000 pair produced \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron events were produced for mass points 300, 500, and 1000 GeV/\(c^{2}\), respectively. The simulation of the response of the detector was performed by Atlsim[45] version 7.2.0, using Geant-3. The ATLAS reconstruction package[46] used was RecExCommon, distribution number 10.0.2.

Pythia was also used to estimate sources of background which could mimic a \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron in the detector. The processes considered here are single boson (\(W\), \(Z\)) and diboson production, \(t\bar{t}\), \(b\bar{b}\) production, plus additional potential sources of background, not included in the preceding list, but which are calculable to leading order and which are generically referred to as QCD processes. Only events containing at least one muon with a value of \(p_{T}\) above 125 GeV were simulated. Around 21,000 events per background source were simulated under the same conditions as the signal sample. This corresponds to an equivalent integrated luminosity of at least \(4.5\)fb\({}^{-1}\) for each background source.

## Hadronisation of Gluinos

The hadronisation of gluinos was performed within Jetset, using a Peterson fragmentation function [47], extrapolated to the \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron mass region under study. The mesonic states \(M_{\tilde{g}}^{+}\), \(M_{\tilde{g}}^{-}\), \(M_{\tilde{g}}^{0}\) and baryonic states \(S_{\tilde{g}}^{++}\), \(S_{\tilde{g}}^{+}\), \(S_{\tilde{g}}^{-}\), \(S_{\tilde{g}}^{--}\) and \(S_{\tilde{g}}^{0}\) are produced in the hadronisation model3. Furthermore, neutral \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons can also be formed as gluino ball (\(\tilde{g}g\)) states. The \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons were not allowed to decay, in accordance with the Split-SUSY scenario considered The dominant theoretical uncertainty for this work concerns the fraction of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons which enter the detector with zero charge. If the mass splitting between the \(\tilde{g}q\bar{q}\) and the state \(\tilde{g}g\) is larger than the pion mass, the \(M_{\tilde{g}q\bar{q}}\) states would then decay quickly into the neutral \(\tilde{g}g\) state. However, it is predicted [36] that the mass splitting is sufficiently small so as to exclude this.

Within Pythia, all produced \(\text{M}_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(\text{S}_{\tilde{g}}\) states made from a given gluino are each assigned a common mesonic and baryonic mass. The probability \(P_{\tilde{g}g}\) of forming a gluino ball in the hadronisation step is set to \(0.1\) within Pythia, a value motivated by the gluino's colour octet nature. Following the hadronisation process around \(55\%\) of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons are neutral.

An alternative approach to the hadronisation of gluinos is available within the cluster model as implemented in Herwig[39, 48]. The difference between Herwig and Jetset in the prediction of the fraction of neutral \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons formed is less than \(3\%\). However, in this study a much larger uncertainty is considered since knowledge of the hadronisation of such a massive colour state is _a priori_ unknown.

Other model uncertainties in the hadronisation of gluinos, such as the values of the \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron's gluino constituent mass, are expected to have a negligible effect on the quantities studied here [38].

## 3 Simulation of the Scattering of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons in Material

The probability of an interaction between the gluino in the R\({}_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron and a quark in the target nucleon is low since the cross-section varies with the inverse square of the parton mass according to perturbative QCD. When modelling the scattering of a \(R\)-hadron in material, one can thus use the central picture of a stable non-interacting gluino accompanied by a coloured hadronic cloud of light constituents, which are responsible for the interactions. The effective interaction energy is therefore small and equivalent to the interactions of a pion of energy of around several GeV with a stationary nucleus.

A further feature of \(R\)-hadron scattering is that, following multiple scatterings, a mesonic \(R\)-hadron will almost always have converted into a baryonic state [36]. This is due to phase space suppression for baryon-to-meson conversion and the lack of available pions, with which the R-baryon must interact in order to give up its baryon number. The available baryon states are \(S^{0}_{\tilde{g}}\), \(S^{+}_{\tilde{g}}\),\(S^{-}_{\tilde{g}}\), and \(S^{++}_{\tilde{g}}\). The state \(S^{--}_{\tilde{g}}\), if formed, would possess negative baryon number and would immediately interact to become a meson.

An important consequence of the nuclear reactions is that they allow a \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron to reverse the sign of its charge in nuclear interactions. This is a property which is shared with \(R\)-hadrons containing \(\pm\frac{1}{3}e\)C charged squarks, eg \(R_{\tilde{b}}\)-hadrons. However, other putative long-lived particles, such as a \(\tilde{\tau}\) or a hadron containing a squark with charge \(\pm\frac{2}{3}e\)C, eg \(R_{\tilde{t}}\)-hadrons, can not reverse the sign of their charge. Furthermore, it is possible to distinguish between \(R_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(R_{\tilde{b}}(R_{\tilde{b}})\)-hadrons using their nuclear interactions. \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons can transform into a doubly charged state \(S^{++}_{\tilde{g}}\) which is not possible with \(R_{\tilde{b}}(R_{\tilde{b}})\)-states.

Thus, an observation of \(R\)-hadrons which reverse the sign of their charge and which form a doubly charged state could, on the basis of fundamentally allowed and forbidden reactions, be used to quantify the colour and electric charge of the heavy exotic particle.

Calculations of the fine details of \(R\)-hadron scattering in matter are uncertain, and a number of models have been proposed in the literature [34, 35, 36, 12, 49]. The model [36] which is used in this study is implemented in Geant-3 [50]. The model provides a simple and general framework of simulating nuclear interactions of heavy hadrons independently of the new physics model in which the hadron arises. In the model only 2-2 and 2-3 processes for mesonic and baryonic \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons are considered, corresponding to around 140 reactions. Since a gluon is able to fluctuate into a \(q\bar{q}\) system, the gluino ball state is considered to interact like an ordinary R-meson. The total cross-section is set constant for gluino R-meson and R-baryon interactions to 24mb and 36mb, respectively, based on arguments from quark counting and the values obtained from low energy hadron-hadron scattering. The relative fraction of 2-2 and 2-3 processes is determined by a phase space factor. Since it would be impossible to calculate individual Clebsch-Gordon coefficients for each matrix element for each reaction, the matrix elements are assumed to be the same. The interaction length in iron is around \(14\)cm, implying that a \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron will typically interact on at least \(5\) occasions as it propagates through the ATLAS calorimeter system.

In addition to nuclear energy losses, a charged \(R\)-hadron can also lose energy through continuous ionisation [51] and repeated elastic Coulomb scatterings with nuclei. These effects are modelled within Geant-3.

Theoretical uncertainties associated with the choice of model used in this work are addressed in the discussion of the results in section 6.

## 4 \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons in the ATLAS Detector

A \(R_{\tilde{g}}\) pair-production event which has been fully simulated and reconstructed by the ATLAS detector is shown in Fig.2 using the Atlantis[52] program. As can be seen, the \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons is produced approximately back-to-back in the transverse plane and each leaves a track. The first \(R_{\tilde{g}}\) is produced with non-zero charge and leaves track elements in both the Inner Detector [5, 53] and Muon Spectrometer [5, 54] (track 1). The second \(R_{\tilde{g}}\) is produced with zero charge, but following interactions in the ATLAS calorimeters [5, 55] is converted to a charged particle which leaves a track in the muon system (track 2).

One signature of a \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron candidates is thus that they leave tracks in both the Inner Detector and Muon Spectrometer. Such tracks are known as combined tracks. The simulated efficiency of reconstructing a combined track arising from a \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron which is produced with a value of \(p_{T}\) above \(150\) GeV and in the range \(|\eta|<2.5\), is around \(14\%\) at a mass of 300 GeV. The losses largely arise from well understood sources.

For example, the acceptance losses following the restrictions in \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) are around \(45\%\). Furthermore, around \(55\%\) of \(R\)-hadrons are produced as neutral particles and therefore escape detection in the Inner Detector. A further loss arises due to \(R\)-hadrons which stop in material. The fraction of stopped \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons is around \(5\%\). In order to be detected in the muon system, the \(R\)-hadrons which leave the calorimeter must possess non-zero charge. The fraction of neutrals in the muon system is approximately \(25\%\), Thus, an acceptance of around \(18\%\) is expected for an ideal ATLAS detector; to be compared with a simulated efficiency of about \(14\%\) obtained using the full ATLAS detector simulation. Although the rate of stopping increases with mass, the overall efficiency is roughly constant since an increasing fraction of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons satisfy the \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) restrictions.

The discrepancy between the ideal and simulated efficiency is due to inefficiencies in track finding in the Inner Detector and Muon Spectrometer, and the linking of tracks between between them. Reconstructing \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron tracks offer special challenges to the tracking reconstruction algorithms since the \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron can undergo scattering in support structures in the muon system. This can lead to the \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron changing charge and thus producing a track consisting of segments of different charges. The efficiency of reconstructing a \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron track which is charged in the Inner Detector and Muon Spectrometer is around \(80\%\) for the kinematic range considered in this work.

### Triggering on \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadrons

During early running, the ATLAS detector will employ the \(\mu 6\) trigger [54, 56]. This trigger was originally designed to select muons with values of \(p_{T}\) greater than \(6\) GeV/\(c\) although the threshold has now been raised to \(20\) GeV/\(c^{2}\). In this analysis, a \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron candidate is required to have a \(p_{T}\) greater than \(150\) GeV and so will easily satisfy this requirement. A major loss, however, arises from the speed of the \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron. A \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron will be selected as long as it is fast enough to match the temporal gate of the trigger. It is also important that the \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron trigger is not delayed by more than \(25\)ns compared to that of a muon, so that the trigger is associated with the correct bunch crossing. It has been shown that \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadrons possessing values of \(\beta\) greater than \(0.7\) will always satisfy the timing requirements of the trigger [38].

For this study a conservative approach was adopted. A \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron event is only considered if at least one of the \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadrons possesses \(\beta>0.7\). Furthermore, this requirement permits the use of ionisation energy loss as a discriminant between \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadrons and high energy muons, as detailed in the next section. Distributions of \(\beta\) for \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadrons of various masses in the high transverse momentum region \(p_{T}>150\) GeV are shown in Fig. 3. A tail stretching to low values of \(\beta\) becomes more prominent with higher masses. The condition that \(\beta>0.7\) imposes further losses of around \(25\%\) for \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadrons with masses of \(300\) GeV, and \(60\%\) for \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadrons with masses of \(1\) TeV.

One possible source of trigger inefficiency for \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron events arises due to their nuclear interactions. The \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadrons must remain charged during their passage through the trigger. However, charge exchange reactions in the Muon Spectrometer could lead to short tracks which could degrade the trigger efficiency by up to \(50\)% [38], which is used here as a conservative estimate of this source of inefficiency.

### Detector Signatures of \(R\)-hadron Candidates

Distributions of the \(p_{T}\) signed with the \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron charge and pseudorapidity (\(\eta\)) of combined tracks are shown in Figs. 4- 5. High \(p_{T}\) muons from background sources and \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadron candidates at masses 300, 500, and 1000 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) are shown. The quantities are determined from simulated measurements in the Muon Spectrometer and the rates correspond to an integrated luminosity of \(2\)fb\({}^{-1}\).

As expected from phase space considerations, the \(p_{T}\) spectra becomes progressively harder with higher mass, and, as shown in the \(\eta\) profiles, the \(R_{\bar{g}}\)-hadrons are produced more centrally.

There is an asymmetry in the signed \(p_{T}\) spectra owing to the production of \(S_{\tilde{g}}^{++}\) and absence of \(S_{\tilde{g}}^{--}\) states, which leads to approximately twice as many positively charged tracks than negatively charged tracks. In the track reconstruction algorithm, a charged particle is assumed to possess electric charge \(\pm e\)C and the momentum of the \(S_{\tilde{g}}^{++}\)-baryon is therefore underestimated by a factor of two. This leads to an asymmetry not only in the rate of positive and negative tracks but also in their shapes. From the discussion in section 3, the asymmetry in the signed \(p_{T}\) distribution could not occur for a \(R\)-hadron containing a \(\pm\frac{1}{3}e\)C electrically charged object, but which could nevertheless show charge reversal. This asymmetry can thus be considered a characteristic observable for \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons which could be used to discriminate between these two hypotheses.

The expected contributions from background processes are also shown, with the contribution from each process added cumulatively in each histogram. The dominant background arises from single boson production. It should be remembered that the background processes contain a pre-selection of at least one muon with \(p_{T}\) greater than \(125\) GeV/\(c\).

Figs. 6 and 7 show distributions of the ratio of the signed transverse momentum in the Muon Spectrometer to the absolute value of the momentum in the Inner Detector for \(R\)-hadron candidates in which the Inner Detector track was negative and postive, respectively. Around \(50\%\) of \(R\)-hadron candidates display a charge reversal signature, compared with less than 1\(\%\) of background muons. The origin of the apparent charge reversal of background muons is due to charge misidentification in either the Inner Detector or Muon Spectrometer.

The angle \(\alpha=acos(\frac{{\bf p^{id}}.{\bf p^{\mu}}}{|{\bf p^{id}}||{\bf p^{\mu}}|})\), as calculated using the scalar product of the 3-momenta of the particle measured in the inner detector (\({\bf p^{id}}\)) and in the muon system (\({\bf p^{\mu}}\)), is shown in Fig. 8. The value of \(\alpha\) should be close to zero. The tails arise due to the reconstruction software applying false links.

The quantity \(\frac{p_{T}^{\mu}}{p_{T}^{id}}\), as calculated using the transverse momenta of the particle measured in the inner detector \(p_{T}^{id}\) and the muon system \(p_{T}^{\mu}\), is shown in Fig. 9. The tail of the distribution is far greater for background tracks than \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron tracks.

Given the requirement for \(\beta>0.7\), the average value of \(\beta\gamma\) is around \(1\), as can be seen in Fig. 3 for \(R\)-hadrons. For background muons with values of \(p_{T}\) greater than \(150\) GeV, \(\beta\gamma\) is greater than \(1000\). This implies that around \(20-30\)% less ionisation energy loss is expected for the \(R\)-hadrons for this selection. The distribution of the fraction of hits in the ATLAS Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT) [5, 57] which are 'high threshold hits' i.e. corresponding to large ionisation energy loss, is shown in Fig. 10, and it can be seen that the \(R\)-hadrons lose less energy than the background muons.

Since the \(R\)-hadron will undergo nuclear scattering in the calorimeter, perhaps change charge, and then possibly interact in the muon system, a degradation of the quality of the combined track can occur. Fig. 11 shows the distribution of \(\chi^{2}\) per number of degrees of freedom of the fit linking the track element in the Inner Detector with the Muon Spectrometer. The peak of the signal distribution is shifted to around 1.5, compared to the background muons, which peak around 1.1. The signal spectra also show far more substantial tails in the distribution than the background.

For events in which two \(R\)-hadron candidates are identified, the cosine of the angle \(\psi\) between the tracks is evaluated. This is shown in Fig. 12. This shows that the \(R\)-hadron candidates are more likely to be produced back-to-back than the background muons.

Search Strategy

Three complementary cut scenarios were employed. The first scenario directly searches for massive long-lived particles which leave tracks with opposite signs of charge in the Inner Detector and Muon Spectrometer. This scenario has the advantage of directly observing charge reversal. Together with a study of the charge dependence of the transverse momentum spectrum of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron candidates, charge reversal processes could be used to both discover and identify \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons. However, the estimated discovery potential with this method is necessarily dependent on the charge reversal predictions of the scattering model [36]. Furthermore, it also relies on a detailed understanding of the response of the Inner Detector, the Muon Spectrometer and the track linking between them.

It is therefore appropriate to consider alternative scenarios which are robust to theoretical uncertainties and less reliant on a complete understanding of several detector sub-systems being available during the commissioning phase of ATLAS. The second scenario thus considers two like-signed tracks in the Muon Spectrometer and is independent of the presence of any track in the Inner Detector. The third scenario similarly considers two like-signed tracks in the Muon Spectrometer but imposes the additional requirement that neither of these tracks is linked to an Inner Detector track. These two scenarios are robust to many theoretical uncertainties. \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons can be produced with (a) opposite sign charge or (b) same sign charge then the observation of two-like muons can either result from charge reversal of one of the \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons in situation (a), or no charge reversal in situation (b). Furthermore, this second selection also includes events in which a pair of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons were produced as neutral particles and then changed to charged particles in the muon system. Such events were excluded by the first cut scenario. A disadvantage of the second scenario is that a pair of high \(p_{T}\) like-sign muons is a signature of a number of different exotic phenomena [58, 59, 60]. However, by insisting that no Inner Detector track is present, the third scenario explicitly searches for particles which are able to change from neutral to charged tracks, i.e. \(R\)-hadrons. This latter scenario can also distinguish between species of \(R\)-hadrons or other putative long-lived charged particles. The pair production of (\(\mu^{-}\), \(\mu^{+}\)), (\(\tilde{\tau}\), \(\tilde{\tilde{\tau}}\)) or (\(R_{\tilde{t}}\), \(R_{\tilde{t}}\))-hadrons would not lead to a signature of two like sign tracks in the Muon System unlike the pair production of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\) or (\(R_{\tilde{b}}\), \(R_{\tilde{b}}\))-hadrons.

For the first scenario, the following cuts were required:

* At least one combined track is required with transverse momentum greater than \(150\) GeV for mass values below \(1000\) GeV. For a mass of \(1000\) GeV, the threshold is raised to \(350\) GeV.
* The pseudorapidity of the track is required to satisfy \(|\eta|<2.5\) for masses below \(1000\) GeV. For a mass of \(1000\) GeV, the interval is \(|\eta|<2.0\).
* The angle \(\alpha\) is required to less than \(0.05\) rad. This cut ensures good matching between the muon system and inner tracker.
* The quantity \(\frac{P_{T}^{\mu}}{P_{T}^{\mu}}\) was required to be less than \(2.0\). This cut is complementary to the previous selection, and further suppresses the rate of falsely linked tracks.

* The \(\chi^{2}\) per number of degrees of freedom of the fit of the link between the Muon and Inner Detector tracks is required to greater than \(1.0\).
* The fraction of high threshold hits of a track is required to be less than \(0.15\) to exploit differences in ionisation energy loss between the selected \(R\)-hadrons and background muons.
* The Inner Detector and Muon Spectrometer tracks were required to have opposite signs of charge.

The efficiency of the first scenario following the cuts outlined above and the trigger and \(\beta\) selections are \(1.9\%\), \(2.4\%\), and \(1.7\%\) for masses \(300\), \(500\) and \(1000\) GeV, respectively.

For the second scenario and third scenarios:

* Two tracks in the Muon Spectrometer with the same charge are required. For masses below \(1000\) GeV, the transverse momenta of the tracks must be greater than \(150\) GeV. For a mass of \(1000\) GeV, the threshold is raised to \(350\) GeV.
* The pseudorapidity of each track must satisfy \(|\eta|<2.5\) for masses below \(1000\) GeV. For a mass of \(1000\) GeV, the interval is \(|\eta|<2.0\).
* The two tracks are required to be back-to-back in the transverse plane and \(cos(\psi)\) is restricted to be less than \(-0.98\).
* The third scenario requires, in addition to the previous cuts, that neither of the tracks in the Muon Spectrometer were linked to Inner Detector tracks.

The efficiency of the second (third) scenario following the cuts outlined above and the trigger and \(\beta\) selections are \(1.5\%\) (\(0.5\%\)), \(2.0\%\) (\(0.6\%\)), and \(1.4\%\) (\(0.6\%\)) for masses \(300\), \(500\) and \(1000\) GeV, respectively.

## 6 Results and Discussion

Following the selection cuts outlined in section 5 the expected yields for \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron and background events for an integrated luminosity of \(2\)fb\({}^{-1}\) are summarised in Tables 1 2, and 3. Scaling with the expected cross-section would reduce the \(1\) TeV mass yields by around a factor \(2\) if a mass of \(1.1\) TeV were considered.

Under the assumptions of the models used, all three scenarios show great sensitivity to the production of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons with masses up to around \(1\) TeV. At \(1\) TeV mass, the first scenario predicts \(16\)\(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons with an expected background of \(2\). Considering a pair of like-sign tracks in the Muon Spectrometer (scenario 2) would also allow a discovery of \(R\)-hadrons with masses up to around \(1\) TeV and gives a prediction of \(13\) signal and \(1\) background event at \(1\) TeV mass. The third scenario becomes a counting exercise since no background is expected at all compared with a signal expectation of \(6\).

In keeping with earlier ATLAS physics studies [5], the significance of the signal was quantified using Poisson statistics as the probability to observe a statistical fluctuation in the background such that the total yield exceeded the sum of the signal and background. Expressing the results in the usual Gaussian standard deviations, in each of the cases under study the significance is far greater than \(5\sigma\), the usual discovery criteria. In the third scenario no background is expected, although this could be due to the limited statistical precision of the sample of events. Assuming that the observation of zero events was due to a \(1\sigma\) downward fluctuation, then this would correspond to an expectation of around \(0.49\) (following luminosity scaling and assuming the background arose from the \(t\bar{t}\) sample which has the lowest equivalent luminosity of \(4.5\) fb\({}^{-1}\)). If this number is used as the background yield in the same procedure as used in scenarios \(1\) and \(2\), then the significance is around \(4.95\sigma\). This latter procedure is an under-estimate of the significance but this is not important for the purpose of showing that a discovery would be possible in early LHC running.

However, as with all studies of discovery potentials, the expected rates are subject to a number of sources of uncertainty. The significances discussed above must be understood in the light of these.

Uncertainties owing to an incomplete simulation of the detector response cannot be addressed until the start of the LHC. Nevertheless, some qualitative conclusions can be drawn. For lower masses in which the gluino pair production cross-section is huge, \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons should be visible even in the presence of additional systematic uncertainties. For masses around \(1\) TeV at which we expect a handful of signal and background events, small detector effects such as a doubling of the charge misidentification rate would hamper the search. However, these effects can be studied from collision data, and will be quantified and minimised. Such work will be a priority following the start of data-taking, since charge identification and optimal muon reconstruction are critical for the ATLAS physics program. Furthermore, as mentioned, the search strategies are complementary and rely on different capabilities of the ATLAS detector.

Theoretical uncertainties can be more quantitatively addressed.

* In the extreme scenario that the probability of gluino ball formation is unity during the hadronisation step, the first scenario would no longer be applicable. However, since the species of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron following repeated scattering is only weakly correlated with the Inner Detector \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons, this would not have a large influence on the second and third scenarios. If the gluino ball probability is zero then the rates from the first scenario would increase by around \(10\%\).
* The value of the \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron scattering cross-section in material affects the rate of stopping and charge reversal. Varying the cross-section by \(\pm 50\%\) leads to variations of up to \(15\%\) in the observed rates in the three scenarios.
* In the extremely unlikely case of no charge reversal, then the first scenario could not be used. However, the production rate at the primary \(pp\) collision of same sign \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadron pairs is predicted to be same as opposite sign pairs. This then implies that the discovery potential of scenario 2 would be unchanged provided that the production rate of neutral \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons was unchanged. If reactions involving neutral to charged states were still permitted then scenario \(3\) could still be used.

* Uncertainties in the perturbative QCD cross-section predictions for signal and background processes from the fixed order QCD programs Pythia and Prospino were estimated by varying the values of the renormalisation and factorisation scales of each process by 0.5 and 2.0. This process provides an estimate to be made of the effects of higher orders. Adopting this procedure leads to variations in the rates of these processes by around \(20\%\).
* Changing the pdf from Mrst to Cteq5m would increase both the signal and background cross-sections by \(15\%\) to \(30\%\).

Thus, theoretical uncertainties can either enhance or inhibit the discovery potential of ATLAS for \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons, although a discovery at around \(1\) TeV mass should still be possible using any of the three scenarios, in the first full year of running. The only situation which is likely to prevent discovery of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons using the methods outlined here would involve anomalously high rates of neutral \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons entering the Muon Spectrometer.

## 7 Future Outlook

In addition to the cut scenarios outlined, additional observables such as muon timing, and global event properties, for example thrust, can also be employed. These can help reach the high mass region in which background suppression is most problematic.

A systematic comparison of the response of the ATLAS detector to various species of \(R\)-hadrons: \(R_{\tilde{g}}\), \(R_{\tilde{t}}\),\(R_{\tilde{t}}\),\(R_{\tilde{b}}\),\(R_{\tilde{b}}\) will be able to quantify how well ATLAS can distinguish between particles, and thereby the physics mechanisms which can produce them.

It is also appropriate to stress that, in addition to preparatory work based on simulated data-sets, it is equally important that running experiments perform such studies with collision data. The topic of \(R_{\tilde{g}}\)-hadrons is currently being addressed in a workshop devoted to the interplay between the experimental programs of the Tevatron and the LHC [37, 61].

## 8 Summary

The existence of stable, heavy, charged particles has been predicted within a number of different scenarios of physics beyond the Standard Model. One of the tasks of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC will be the discovery of such particles and measurements of their quantum numbers.

In this paper, the discovery potential of the ATLAS detector to the pair production of stable gluino \(R\)-hadrons has been investigated within a Split-SUSY scenario. QCD-based calculations for gluino pair production, \(R\)-hadron formation, and background processess have been used with a simulation of \(R\)-hadron propagation through the ATLAS detector.

Three complementary search scenarios were outlined. One explicitly uses the rate of tracks arising from a stable heavy charged particle which are linked between the ATLAS Inner Detector and Muon Spectrometer but which possess unlike sign electric charge in these subsystems.

Using a model for charge exchange reactions involving \(R\)-hadrons in the ATLAS calorimeter, it was shown that the rate of such tracks and their measured transverse momentum spectra would enable both the discovery of \(R\)-hadrons and the identification of its fundamental heavy constituent as possessing colour octet charge. The second and third strategies exploit the rate of like sign tracks in the Muon Spectrometer. These strategies are more robust to theoretical uncertainties associated with \(R\)-hadron production and scattering and are not so reliant upon a perfectly understood ATLAS detector during the start-up phase of the LHC.

Using these strategies it was shown that the ATLAS detector is expected to be able to discover stable gluino \(R\)-hadrons with masses up to around \(1\) TeV in early LHC running.
