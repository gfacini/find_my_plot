## 1 Introduction

This note documents a simulation-based study of the confidence regions for the search for lepton flavour violating decays (LFV) of \(\tau\) leptons in the \(\tau\to 3\mu\) channel expected with the HL-LHC data-taking campaign corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the ATLAS detector [1]. Two different production channels are considered, the W-channel in which the \(\tau\) lepton originates from W-boson decays and the heavy flavour (HF) channel in which the \(\tau\) lepton is produced in decays of c- and b-hadrons, dominated by the \(D_{s}\to\tau\nu\) decay. Background events arise dominantly from lepton fakes from hadrons (\(c\bar{c}/b\bar{b}\to X\mu\mu\)), with additional contributions due to pile-up.

Flavour violation has been observed in both the quark and the neutral lepton sectors, but not for charged leptons. In the SM charged lepton flavour violating branching fractions are heavily suppressed, with predicted values of the order of \(10^{-55}\)[2], leaving no possibility to observe such SM processes at any collider based experiment. In new physics scenarios, such as non universal \(Z^{\prime}\)[3], SO(10) supersymmetric [4] or Type-II Seesaw [5] models with an extended Higgs sector, predicted branching fractions can be of the order of up to \(10^{-10}-10^{-8}\), opening the possibility of observing such effects. Observing \(\tau\to 3\mu\) decays would provide an immediate proof of physics beyond the SM. The presented studies extrapolate the latest result from the ATLAS collaboration of the \(\tau\to 3\mu\) search in the \(W\to\tau\nu\) channel, which is based on the data collected during Run 1 [6].

## 2 Analysis procedure

The increased number of pile-up events in the extrapolation of the Run 1 result is assumed to have no strong impact on the performance of the analysis and thus has been neglected. The analysis workflow is taken to be unchanged w.r.t the Run 1 analysis: a loose cut-based pre-selection to select events with three muons originating from a common vertex and kinematics compatible with the ones expected of a \(\tau\) lepton decay is applied. This loosely selected dataset is used to train a machine learning algorithm1 using recorded data events from a mass sideband region as background model and Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation for the signal. Given the low number of expected background events (<1) in the 8 TeV analysis a complicated fitting procedure involving fits to the BDT and invariant three-muon mass shape has been developed. It is assumed that this will be repeated in this work's projections, although a higher background level might be expected in the HL-LHC scenario. The underlying assumption is that any change to this procedure will not influence the performance of the analysis. Lower systematic uncertainties on the background expectation are taken into account as detailed below. Additionally, the Run 1 analysis allowed to improve trigger selection and offline muon reconstruction, that was included in the Run 2 and HL-LHC MC simulation. Signal yields will be extrapolated from Run 2 MC simulation. The expected upper limit on the branching fraction will be extracted exploiting the relationship:

Footnote 1: In Run 1 a Boosted Decision Tree (BDT) was applied. The exact choice of the algorithm is subject to changes in the future, e.g. to Neural Networks (NN). In this note it is assumed that the performance of the classifier is at least as good as the BDT in Run 1.

\[BR(\tau\to 3\mu)=\frac{N_{S}^{UL}}{\mathcal{A}\times\epsilon\cdot N_{X\to\tau\nu}} \tag{1}\]

with \(N_{S}^{UL}\) being the upper limit on the expected number of signal events, \(\mathcal{A}\times\epsilon\) the signal acceptance times efficiency of the selection, and \(N_{X\to\tau\nu}\) the number of expected tau leptons produced via the decayof a given initial state X, being either a W-boson or charm/beauty hadron. The HL-LHC ATLAS tracker upgrades [7; 8] entail improvements in vertex and mass determination. This reflects in an improved mass resolution in both the W-channel and HF-channel. Figure 1 exemplifies this, comparing the reconstructed tau mass obtained from Run 2 simulations to the one obtained from simulating the HL-LHC detector and collision conditions. The reconstructed tau mass is fitted with a double-Gaussian with both means and width floating. The total width, \(\sigma\), is obtained from the weighted average of the width of each single Gaussian. Signal mass windows different from the ones used in Run 1 are included as an improvement taking advantage of the reduced background contributions.

Given that the Run 1 analysis was performed in the W-channel only different extrapolation approaches are chosen for the two production modes and are summarised in the following two sections.

### W-channel

The projection in the W-channel is based on the ATLAS Run 1 result [6]. The inclusive W production cross section at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\) has been calculated at NNLO using FEWZ [9; 10] and the MSTW2008NNLO pdf set [11] to \(\sigma(pp\to W^{\pm}(\to l\nu))=21.66\) nb [12], thus in 3ab\({}^{-1}\) of collision data the tau lepton yield from W-boson decays increased by about a factor of 260 w.r.t the Run 1 statistics (\(N_{W\to\tau\nu}^{\mathrm{HL-LHC}}=6.50\times 10^{10}\)). Since the Run 1 result, several improvements in triggering on low momentum and close-by muons as well as their reconstruction have been developed and deployed. To estimate the impact of these improvements the combined trigger and reconstruction efficiencies are evaluated in Run 2 MC simulation relative to Run 1. The acceptance improves by a factor of 2.2 evaluated on Run 2 and this is confirmed using HL-LHC MC simulations. Scenarios corresponding to different assumed levels of analysis improvements, relative to the Run 1 benchmark are defined, taking into account different optimisations.

1. **Non-improved scenario:** Here no analysis or detector improvements are considered and the sensitivity is extrapolated scaling for the integrated luminosity and higher production cross section at \(\sqrt{s}=14\,\mathrm{TeV}\). The background yield of the Run 1 analysis (\(\mathrm{N_{bkg}^{Run~{}1}}=0.193\)) is scaled by a factor of 260, while \(\mathcal{A}\times\epsilon\) is considered to be the same as in Run 1. This is by far the most conservative approach of the three approaches.
2. **Intermediate scenario:** In this scenario the improvements in triggering and reconstruction of low \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) muons estimated from Run 2 MC are included in the projection, while no effects on further

impacts of the machine learning (ML) selection or better resolution are considered. The net effect of these improvements is an increase of a factor 2.2 in the signal yield relative to Run 1. Additionally, the extrapolation factor of 260 accounting for the increased cross-section and integrated luminosity is applied.
3. **Improved scenario:** In this scenario the signal search window is tightened, taking into account expected improvements in mass resolution. The improvement is estimated fitting the HL-LHC MC signal three-muon invariant mass resolution with a double Gaussian model. The combined fit has a width 20% smaller than the Run 1 counterpart. The improved mass resolution and thus smaller signal region reflects in a 25% improvement in the S/B ratio which is applied to the projection. The improvements of the previous scenarios are applicable as well.

The expected sensitivity for each scenario is calculated based on a profile likelihood fit to the expected event yields in the signal region using HistFitter [13]. The likelihood function \(L(\mu_{s},\hat{\theta})\) consists of Poisson probabilities for the event yield in the signal region and a Gaussian distribution for the systematic uncertainties which are included in the fit as a nuisance parameter, \(\hat{\theta}\). Signal and background yields are linearly scaled by the luminosity, cross section and improvements expected in each scenario. The parameter of interest in such a fit is the signal strength \(\mu_{s}\), corresponding to a scale factor on the signal yield relative to the expected yield. The systematic uncertainty on the background yield in the Run 1 analysis evaluated to 67.9 %. The dominant sources arise from the variation of the three-\(\mu\) mass side-band region used for the extrapolation towards the signal region and the uncertainty on the BDT fit which is mainly driven by the low number of background events. As the general strategy will remain the same, this is expected to be the dominant contributor also in future analyses. In particular the analysis is expected to be optimised such that the expected background yield is still small. However, given that no proper background model can be provided by means of simulation, it is impossible to retrieve a reasonable estimate of the machine learning algorithm and thus the \(\mathcal{A}\times\epsilon\) in a small background scenario. Thus, in this projection the expected number of background events will be considered high as does the signal acceptance and efficiency.

In this scenario assuming a large systematic uncertainty is unreasonable and would introduce an additional penalty factor on top of the large background yield. As pointed out above in Run 1 the systematic uncertainty was dominated by statistics available for the background estimation. Scaling this down with the increased statistics corresponding to the HL-LHC luminosity but preserving constant terms for reconstruction efficiency systematics results in an assumed uncertainty of the 15%. The impact of varying the background systematic uncertainty by 5% has been evaluated to a change of the upper limit of 10%. Based on the expected upper limit on the signal yields, the limit on BR(\(\tau\to 3\mu\)) can be calculated according to Eq. 1. Fig 2 shows the CL\({}_{\rm s}\) curves for each discussed scenario. The expected 90% CL\({}_{\rm s}\) upper limits on the \(\tau\to 3\mu\) branching fraction are obtained from the intersection with the red line. The corresponding projections are summarised together with the considered inputs in Tab. 1.

### HF-channel

Although with a less clean signature, the majority of \(\tau\) leptons produced at the LHC originate from heavy flavour meson decays, dominated by \(D_{s}\) decays. The HF-channel has not been exploited by ATLAS so far, but the W-channel result can be used as the basis for a rough sensitivity extrapolation to the HF case. \(D_{s}\) mesons are produced either promptly or in the decay of b-hadrons. The inclusive cross section for the production of HF decays to tau leptons has been calculated at Fixed Order Next to Leading Log (FONLL) [14, 15, 16] using the CTEQ 6.6 pdf set [17] and is found to be \(\sigma({\rm HF}\to\tau\nu)=\left(745^{+172}_{-130}\right)\) nbin the fiducial phase space defined by \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 10 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Systematic uncertainties include variations of the scales and masses and are combined quadratically. Thus, in 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of pp collision data \(N_{HF\to\tau\nu}=\left(2.23^{+0.52}_{-0.39}\right)\times 10^{12}\) are expected, which increases the dataset of recorded \(\tau\) leptons by a factor of \(\sim\) 40 compared to the W-channel. Tau leptons from HF decays tend to have lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) relative to the W-produced ones, resulting in a smaller acceptance. The trigger and reconstruction efficiencies are estimated from MC simulations of \(c\bar{c}/b\bar{b}\to D_{s}(\tau\to 3\mu)+X\) events. The acceptance is extracted from a generator level study applying kinematic selections looser than the ones imposed by the following trigger scenarios:

1. low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) selection: all three muons have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > 3.5 GeV;
2. high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) selection: three muons must pass \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) > (10.5, 5.5, 2) GeV, respectively.

The efficiency of events passing either of these selections is evaluated to 14%. Since no trigger decision is simulated in the HL-LHC samples, the trigger efficiency is obtained from Run 2 simulation. The resulting \(\mathcal{A}\times\epsilon\) excluding the ML efficiency is 3.1%. Since no ML classifier can be trained due to the lack of a reliable background simulation, the BDT efficiency obtained in the Run 1 analysis of 28% is applied. The upper limit is estimated assuming three different background scenarios:

1. **High background scenario:** This scenario is the most conservative approach taking the background level one order of magnitude larger than in the Run 1 W-channel analysis. The background estimated

in the Run 1 analysis is scaled by the increase in luminosity and data and an additional penalty factor of 10 is applied on top.
2. **Medium background scenario:** In this scenario it is considered that the background level in the HF-channel is a factor of 3 larger than in the W-channel. The scaling according to the increase in luminosity is applied.
3. **Low background scenario:** This is the most aggressive of the scenarios considered in the HF-channel. The background level is assumed to be the same as in the W-channel, still taking into account the increase in luminosity. This scenario provides a reference for the effect of potential analysis improvements.

The background variability considered above is meant to include also a potentially less effective background rejection relative to the W-channel, where the missing energy variable plays an important role. The expected upper limits are estimated with the same procedure used in the W-channel case. Figure 2 and Table 2 summarise the CL\({}_{\rm s}\) curves and the 90% CL\({}_{\rm s}\) limits for the three scenarios considered.

## 3 Conclusion

A study of the ATLAS experiment reach in the search for lepton flavour violation in the charged sector by searching for \(\tau\to 3\mu\) decays at the HL-LHC is presented. The study is based on the results of the \(W\to\tau(\to 3\mu)\nu\) search performed on the data collected during Run 1 of LHC, and takes into account several aspects of the extrapolation such as trigger selections and efficiencies, detector performance effects, luminosity and collision energy conditions, which have been validated using Run 2 simulations. Systematic uncertainties are extrapolated from the Run 1 analysis. Extrapolations to the statistics ATLAS expects to collect at the HL-LHC are performed and upper limits on the \(\tau\to 3\mu\) branching fraction are obtained for different levels of background and \(\mathcal{A}\times\epsilon\). Exclusion limits at 90% CL on the \(\tau\to 3\mu\) branching fraction below \(10^{-8}\) in the W-channel and a few \(10^{-9}\) in the HF-channel are foreseen. Both channels are complementary due to the different tau production channel, contributing backgrounds and systematic uncertainties and thus a combination will yield a stronger limit.
