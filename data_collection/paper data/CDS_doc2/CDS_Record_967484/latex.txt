**Abstract**

The performance of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\,\pi^{-})\,\pi^{+}\) channel using Rome Monte Carlo production is described showing invariant mass plots of \(\phi\), \(D_{s}^{-}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\) as well as kinematic resolutions for the \(B_{s}^{0}\). An estimation of the sensitivity to measure \(B_{s}^{0}\)-\(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) oscillations with the ATLAS detector is given for the detector geometry of "initial layout". The \(\Delta m_{s}\) reach is derived from unbinned maximum likelihood amplitude fits using \(B_{s}^{0}\) events generated with a simplified Monte Carlo method.

Introduction

The observed \(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) particles are linear combinations of the two mass eigenstates with masses \(m_{H}\) and \(m_{L}\) and a mass difference of \(\Delta m_{s}\). Transitions between these two flavor eigenstates are allowed due to non-conservation of flavor in weak-current interactions and will occur with a frequency proportional to \(\Delta m_{s}\). Together with the mass difference \(\Delta m_{d}\) of the \(B_{d}^{0}\) system, which has already been measured with high accuracy (\(\Delta m_{d}=0.502\pm 0.007\)ps\({}^{-1}\)[1]), the measurement of \(\Delta m_{s}\) is an important ingredient for the precise determination of the side \(|V_{td}|\) of the CKM unitarity triangle. The direct determination of \(V_{td}\) and \(V_{ts}\) from \(\Delta m_{d}\) and \(\Delta m_{s}\) is hampered by hadronic uncertainties. These uncertainties partially cancel in the ratio

\[\frac{\Delta m_{s}}{\Delta m_{d}}=\frac{M_{B_{s}^{0}}}{M_{B_{d}^{0}}}\;\frac{ \hat{B}_{B_{s}^{0}}f_{B_{s}^{0}}^{2}}{\hat{B}_{B_{d}^{0}}f_{B_{d}^{0}}^{2}}\; \left|\frac{V_{ts}}{V_{td}}\right|^{2}\;,\]

where \(M_{B}\) are the \(B\)-meson masses, \(\hat{B}_{B}\) are the bag parameters, and \(f_{B}\) are the \(B\)-meson form factors. Using the experimentally-measured masses and a value for the ratio \(\xi=\sqrt{\hat{B}_{B_{s}^{0}}f_{B_{s}^{0}}}/\sqrt{\hat{B}_{B_{d}^{0}}}f_{B_{d }^{0}}\), which can be computed in lattice QCD, the constraint from the ratio \(\Delta m_{s}/\Delta m_{d}\) is more effective in limiting the position of the apex of the unitarity triangle than the value obtained by \(\Delta m_{d}\) measurements alone.

\(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations have been observed recently at the Fermilab Tevatron collider. Whereas the DO collaboration is reporting a two-sided bound \(17<\Delta m_{s}<21\)ps\({}^{-1}\) at 90% CL [2], CDF presents the first measurement of the \(B_{s}^{0}\)-\(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) oscillation frequency finding a signal for \(\Delta m_{s}=17.33\;^{+0.42}_{-0.21}\,\)(stat) \(\pm 0.07\,\)(sys) at 95% CL [3]. Both results are consistent with the prediction of the Standard Model for the upper bound of \(\Delta m_{s}\sim 25\) ps\({}^{-1}\)[4].

The work presented in this note describes the performance of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\,\pi^{-})\,\pi^{+}\) channel as one of the \(B_{s}^{0}\)-\(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) mixing channels using full Rome statistics, and it gives an updated estimate for the \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity from the ATLAS experiment. It follows closely the work described in an earlier note [5] about the prospects for the measurement of \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations with the ATLAS detector at LHC using the detector layout of the Physics TDR [6], where details concerning analysis of the \(D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel and exclusive background channels as well as a description of the systematic uncertainties contributing to the calculation of the \(\Delta m_{s}\) reach can be found. Changes in the detector layout and evolving software for the generation-simulation-reconstruction chain require an updated estimation for the value of the \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement sensitivity for the ATLAS detector. B-physics performance studies with this new layout using Data Challenge 1 tools are published in [7], however the physics analysis results concerning the studies on \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations are represented in this note.

Section 2 gives a short characterization of the detector layout and the software tools used for the analysis. A brief description of the event selection and applied analysis cuts is presented in section 3 together with most important kinematic distributions of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\,\pi^{+}\) events. Results (statistical errors only) for the expected sensitivity to measure the oscillation frequency derived from maximum likelihood amplitude fits follow in section 4.

Tools and detector layout

### Properties of the Inner Detector layout

The Inner Detector layout has been continuously evolving since the times of the Physics TDR. Smaller shifts have occurred to the positions and dimensions of the Silicon Microstrip detector (SCT) and the Transition Radiation detector (TRT), whereas major changes have been made to the pixel modules. In order to accommodate to the increased diameter of the beam-pipe the radius of the innermost pixel layer (b-layer) has been changed from 4.3 cm to 5 cm. The longitudinal size of the pixels in the b-layer has been set to 400 \(\mu\)m instead of the design value of 300 \(\mu\)m.

The pixel detector has an independent insertion capability, therefore parts can be staged in the initial data-taking period (see "initial layout") and damaged parts can be replaced later on. At the time of Rome Monte Carlo production the detector layout used for simulation and reconstruction was "initial layout", where the middle pixel layer and the end-cap TRT 'C' wheels are staged. The favored layout of the Inner Detector is the "complete layout", which includes these missing parts. A detailed description of the ATLAS Inner Detector performance is given in [8].

### Generation, simulation, reconstruction and analysis

A sample of 50k \(B^{0}_{s}\to D_{s}\pi\) events has been generated in the early Data Challenge 1 (DC1) period using an ATHENA (release 5.0.0) algorithm, called PythiaB, with a dedicated interface to Pythia 6.2.

\(b\)-quark pairs are produced in \(pp\)-collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV by including direct production, gluon splitting and flavor excitation processes. The \(\bar{b}\) is forced to produce the \(B\)-decay channel, requiring \(p_{\rm T}>0.5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) for all charged final-state particles from the \(B\) decay via so-called "offline cuts". A trigger-like Level 1 single muon cut is applied, selecting events only if one muon with \(p_{\rm T}>6\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) is found. A kinematic cut on the range of allowed \(p_{\rm T}\) values to generate hard scatterings is set to 10 GeV (CKIN(3)=10), which makes Pythia event generation more efficient. See [9] for a detailed description of the \(b\) production parameters and selection cuts applied.

The detector simulation and reconstruction was done by official Rome simulation and reconstruction groups using Grid tools with ATLAS software release 9.0.4 for simulation/digitization and release 10.0.1 for reconstruction. 20k of the events were simulated and reconstructed inside the B-physics group using Grid tools and the same releases as mentioned above. Pileup (2.3 minimum-bias events per bunch for a luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\)) is not included in the simulation of the sample.

The \(B^{0}_{s}\to D_{s}\pi\) analysis code is part of the Athena software package PhysicsAnalysis/BPhys and accesses the information stored in the Analysis Objects Data (AOD). A detailed description of the code is given in the manual "Writing B-Physics analysis code in Athena" [10].

## 3 Event selection and analysis results

The offline analysis for \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\,\pi^{-})\,\pi^{+}\) events proceeds via the following steps:

the \(\phi\) decay vertex is first reconstructed by considering all combinations of pairs of oppositely charged tracks with \(p_{\rm T}>1.5\) GeV for both tracks. Kinematic cuts on the angles between the two tracks \(\Delta\varphi_{KK}<10^{\circ}\) and \(\Delta\theta_{KK}<10^{\circ}\) are imposed (\(\varphi\) is the azimuthal angle and \(\theta\) the polar angle). The two-track vertex is then fitted, assigning the kaon mass to both tracks. Combinations passing a fit-probability [11] cut of 1% (\(\simeq\chi^{2}/{\rm dof}=7/1\)) with the invariant mass within \(3\,\sigma_{\phi}\) of the nominal \(\phi\) mass are selected as \(\phi\) candidates. Figure 2 shows the invariant mass distribution \(M_{KK}\) fitted with a Gauss function giving a mass resolution of \(\sigma_{\phi}\) = 3.71 MeV.

To all accepted \(\phi\) candidates, a third negative track with \(p_{\rm T}>1.5\) GeV from the remaining ones is added. The pion mass is assigned to the third track and a three-track vertex is refitted. Combinations of three tracks, which have a fit probability greater than 1% (\(\simeq\chi^{2}/{\rm dof}=12/3\)) and an invariant mass within \(3\,\sigma_{s}\) of the nominal \(D_{s}\) mass are selected as \(D_{s}^{-}\) candidates. Figure 2 shows the fitted invariant mass distribution \(M_{KK\pi}\) with a Gaussian mass resolution of \(\sigma_{D_{s}}\) = 14.72 MeV.

For each reconstructed \(D_{s}^{-}\) meson a fourth track from the remaining tracks in the event is added. This track is required to have opposite charge with respect to the pion track from the \(D_{s}^{-}\) and \(p_{\rm T}>1\) GeV. The four-track decay vertex is fitted including \(\phi\) and \(D_{s}^{-}\) massconstraints, and requiring that the total momentum of the \(B^{0}_{s}\) vertex points to the primary vertex and the momentum of \(D^{-}_{s}\) vertex points to the \(B^{0}_{s}\) vertex.

In order to be selected as \(B^{0}_{s}\) candidates, the four-track combinations are required to have a vertex fit probability greater than 1% (\(\simeq\chi^{2}/{\rm dof}=20/8\)). The signed separation between the reconstructed \(B^{0}_{s}\) vertex and the primary vertex, and between the \(D^{-}_{s}\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\) vertex are required to be positive (the momentum should not point backward to the parent vertex).

To improve the purity of the sample, further cuts are imposed on the reconstructed \(B^{0}_{s}\) particle: the proper decay time has to be greater than 0.4 ps, the \(B^{0}_{s}\) impact parameter (shortest distance of the particle trajectory from the primary vertex in the transverse plane to the particle decay vertex) is required to be smaller than 55 \(\mu\)m and \(p_{\rm T}\) must be larger than 10 GeV.

Figure 3 shows the fitted invariant mass distribution \(M_{KK\pi\pi}\) resulting from the combination of four tracks associated with the KK\(\pi\pi\) mass hypothesis without constraints on the \(\phi\) or \(D_{s}\) masses. The single Gauss fit gives a mass resolution of \(\sigma_{B_{s}}=\) 42.5 MeV.

The transverse decay length \(d_{xy}\) of the reconstructed \(B^{0}_{s}\) candidates is defined as the distance between the interaction point and the \(B\)-hadron decay vertex projected onto the transverse plane. The distribution of the decay length uncertainty \(\sigma_{d_{xy}}\) (estimated from the covariance matrices of the tracks associated with the vertices), as shown in Figure 4, is parametrized with a combination of a Gauss and an exponential function defined in Eq. 1. These two functions are merged at \(x_{0}=75.0\)\(\mu\)m. The value of \(x_{0}\) is determined empirically.

\[f(x;x\leq x_{0}) = N_{G}\,\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{(x-\mu)^{2}}{\sigma^{2}} \right)\hskip 36.135pt\sigma^{2} = \frac{2}{\lambda^{2}}\left(\lambda\,x_{0}+\log\frac{N_{G}}{N_{E}}\right) \tag{1}\] \[f(x;x>x_{0}) = N_{E}\,\exp(-\lambda\,x)\hskip 71.13189pt\mu = x_{0}-\lambda\,\sigma^{2}\]

The values for the independent parameters \(N_{G}\),\(N_{E}\) and \(\lambda\) are obtained from a fit:

\[N_{G}=436.3\pm 9.4\hskip 36.135ptN_{E}=1447\pm 55.2\hskip 36.135pt\lambda=16.1 7\pm 0.3\]

Figure 3: Reconstructed \(B^{0}_{s}\) invariant mass distribution normalized to 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). The core of the distribution is fitted with a single Gauss.

Figure 5 shows the pull of the transverse decay length, \((d_{xy}-d_{xy}^{0})/\sigma_{d_{xy}}\), which is found to have a Gaussian shape with a width of \(S_{d_{xy}}~{}=~{}1.026\pm 0.011\).

The proper time of the reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates is computed from the reconstructed transverse decay length \(d_{xy}\), the \(B_{s}^{0}\) mass, and from the \(B_{s}^{0}\) transverse momentum \(p_{\rm T}\) given in Eq. 2:

\[t=\frac{d_{xy}M_{B_{s}^{0}}}{cp_{\rm T}}\equiv d_{xy}g \tag{2}\]

The expression \(M_{B_{s}^{0}}/(cp_{\rm T})=:g\) is called the \(g\)-factor. The distribution for the fractional \(g\)-factor resolution \((g-g_{0})/g_{0}\) is shown in Figure 6, with \(g_{0}\) being the "true" \(g\)-factor \(t_{0}/d_{xy}^{0}\). The shape is fitted with a Gaussian resulting in a width of \(\sigma_{g}\) = 0.72%.

Figure 7 shows the proper-time resolution, which is parametrised with the sum of two Gauss functions around the same mean value \(t_{mean}\):

\[{\rm Res}(t\,|\,t_{0})=f_{1}\frac{1}{\sigma_{1}\sqrt{2\pi}}~{}\exp\left(- \frac{(t-t_{mean})^{2}}{2\,\sigma_{1}^{~{}2}}\right)+f_{2}\frac{1}{\sigma_{2} \sqrt{2\pi}}~{}\exp\left(-\frac{(t-t_{mean})^{2}}{2\,\sigma_{2}^{~{}2}}\right) \tag{3}\]

The widths of the two Gaussians resulting from the fit are \(\sigma_{1}\) = (70.3\(\pm\)3.9) fs for the core fraction of 54.7% and \(\sigma_{2}\) = (156.1\(\pm\)6.8) fs for the rest of the tail part of the distribution.

## 4 \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement limits

The estimation of the maximum value of \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurable with ATLAS is considering \(B^{0}_{s}\) candidates from the \(D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) and \(D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) channels.

The expected numbers of \(B^{0}_{s}\) events are given in Table 1 for an integrated luminosity of \(10~{}{\rm fb}^{-1}\). The only significant background comes from the \(\bar{B}^{0}_{d}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) and \(\bar{B}^{0}_{d}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) channels, and from the combinatorial background (Ref. [5]). Due to statistics reasons the estimation of the combinatorial background is very approximate. To be conservative the ratio of signal to combinatorial background is set to 1 for this study. The effective cross-section is the cross-section given by Pythia (after cuts on charged final state particles are applied during generation), multiplied by the branching ratios of the forced decay channels taken from Ref. [1]) and a factor of 2 due to symmetry reasons. Furthermore a correction factor is applied to account for the loss of events due to the setting of the kinematic cut-off parameter, which results in a limited region of the phase space for event generation (see section 2.2). For the \(D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) sample the \(B^{0}_{s}\) events are counted in a \(\pm 2~{}\sigma\) window around the nominal \(B^{0}_{s}\) mass. Using the fraction of events reconstructed in the simulated sample and the number of events expected for an integrated luminosity of \(10~{}{\rm fb}^{-1}\)and corrections for muon efficiency (on average 0.82) and for level-2 trigger efficiency (0.63), the expected number of reconstructed events is estimated.

For Rome statistics the full ATLAS software chain was done only for \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}(\phi\,\pi^{-})\,\pi^{+}\) data. Since the work presented in this note is an update of the analysis described in Ref. [5], which is including \(D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) and exclusive \(B^{0}_{d}\) background channels, the given numbers for these channels in Table 1 are estimated extrapolations. The calculation is donewith the assumption that the ratio of \(B^{0}_{s}\) candidates from the \(D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) channel to the ones from the other decay channels is roughly the same for the analysis done with TDR data and that one for Rome statistics. This seems reasonable, since the analysis method and parameter cut values are the same as for Ref. [5].

### Building of the likelihood function

The probability density to observe an initial \(B^{0}_{j}\) meson (\(j=d,\ s\)) decaying at time \(t_{0}\) after its creation as a \(\bar{B}^{0}_{j}\) meson is given by

\[p_{j}(t_{0},\ \mu_{0})\ =\ \frac{\Gamma_{j}^{2}-\left(\frac{\Delta\Gamma_{j}}{2} \right)^{2}}{2\,\Gamma_{j}}\ \mbox{e}^{-\Gamma_{j}t_{0}}\left(\cosh\frac{\Delta\Gamma_{j}t_{0}}{2}+\mu_{0} \cos\Delta m_{j}t_{0}\right) \tag{4}\]

where \(\Delta\Gamma_{j}=\Gamma_{\rm H}^{j}-\Gamma_{\rm L}^{j}\), \(\Gamma_{j}=(\Gamma_{\rm H}^{j}+\Gamma_{\rm L}^{j})/2\) and \(\mu_{0}=-1\).

For the unmixed case (an initial \(B^{0}_{j}\) meson decaying as a \(B^{0}_{j}\) meson at time \(t_{0}\)), the probability density is obtained by setting \(\mu_{0}=+1\) in Eq. 4. Here the small effects of CP violation are neglected. Unlike \(\Delta\Gamma_{d}\), which can be safely set to zero, the width difference \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\) in the \(B^{0}_{s}\)-\(\bar{B}^{0}_{s}\) system could be as much as 20% of the total width [13].

However, the above probability is modified by experimental effects. The probability as a function of \(\mu_{0}\) and the reconstructed proper time \(t\) is obtained as the convolution of \(p_{j}(t_{0},\ \mu_{0})\) with the proper time resolution \(\mbox{Res}_{j}(t\,|\,t_{0})\):

\[q_{j}(t,\mu_{0})=\frac{1}{N}\int_{0}^{\infty}p_{j}(t_{0},\mu_{0})\ \mbox{Res}_{j}(t\ |\ t_{0})\ \mbox{d}t_{0} \tag{5}\]

with the normalization factor

\[N=\int_{t_{\rm min}}^{\infty}(\int_{0}^{\infty}p_{j}(t^{\prime},\mu_{0})\ \mbox{Res}_{j}(t\ |\ t^{\prime})\ \mbox{d}t^{\prime})\ \mbox{d}t \tag{6}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c} \hline Process & Effective & Simulated & Rec. & Rec. events \\  & cross-section (pb) & events & events & for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) & 4.58 & 40752 & 4634 & 2693 \\ \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) & 2.36 & 32039 & 3356 & 1276 \\ \(\bar{B}^{0}_{d}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) & 0.81 & 17038 & 819 & 45 \\ \(\bar{B}^{0}_{d}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) & 4.28 & 16542 & 422 & 564 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Signal and background samples used for the study of \(B^{0}_{s}\)-\(\bar{B}^{0}_{s}\) oscillations. Numbers for the \(D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) sample are taken from the described analysis for full Rome statistics, whereas numbers for \(D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) and \(B^{0}_{d}\) background channels are an extrapolation based on ratios from TDR analysis.

Here \(t_{\rm min}=0.4\) ps is the cut on the \(B^{0}_{s}\) reconstructed proper decay time. Assuming a fraction \(\omega_{j}\) of wrong tags occurring at production and/or decay, the probability becomes

\[\tilde{q}_{j}(t,\mu)=(1-\omega_{j})q_{j}(t,\mu)+\omega_{j}q_{j}(t,-\mu) \tag{7}\]

where \(\mu_{0}\) has been replaced by \(\mu\) in order to indicate that now we are talking about the experimental observation of same or opposite flavor tags. For each signal channel, the background is composed of oscillating \(B^{0}_{d}\) mesons, with probability given by Eq. 7, and of non-oscillating combinatorial background, with probability given by the Eq. 8, which results from Eq. 4 and Eq. 7 by setting \(\Delta m=0\) and \(\Delta\Gamma=0\) :

\[{\rm p_{cb}}(t,\mu)=\ \frac{\Gamma_{\rm cb}}{2}\ {\rm e}^{-\Gamma_{\rm cb}t} \left[1+\mu\ (1-2\omega_{\rm cb})\right] \tag{8}\]

For a fraction \(f^{k}_{j}\) of the \(j\) component (\(j=s,\ d\), and combinatorial background cb) in the total sample of type \(k\), one obtains the probability density

\[{\rm pdf}_{k}(t,\mu)=\sum_{j=s,d,{\rm cb}}f^{k}_{j}\tilde{q}_{j}(t,\mu) \tag{9}\]

The index \(k=1\) denotes the \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}\pi^{+}\) channel and \(k=2\) the \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) channel. The likelihood of the total sample is written as

\[{\cal L}(\Delta m_{s},\Delta\Gamma_{s})=\prod_{k=1}^{N_{\rm ch}}\ \prod_{i=1}^{N_{\rm ev}^{k}}{\rm pdf}_{k}(t_{i},\mu_{i}) \tag{10}\]

where \(N_{\rm ev}^{k}\) is the total number of events of type \(k\), and \(N_{\rm ch}=2\). Each \({\rm pdf}_{k}\) is properly normalized to unity.

### Creation of the \(B^{0}_{s}\) 'data sample'

A simplified Monte Carlo method is applied to generate a \(B^{0}_{s}\) sample using the following input parameters: for each signal channel \(k\) the number of reconstructed signal events \(N_{\rm sig}^{k}\) for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) and the number of background events \(N_{B_{d}}^{k}\) from \(B^{0}_{d}\) decays is given in Table 1. For the combinatorial background the ratio \(N_{\rm sig}^{k}/N_{\rm cb}^{k}\) is taken to be 1. The wrong-tag fraction is assumed to be the same for both \(B^{0}_{s}\) and \(B^{0}_{d}\) mesons: \(\omega_{s}=\omega_{d}=0.22\) (see Ref. [12]).

A Monte Carlo sample with \(N_{\rm sig}=N_{\rm sig}^{1}+N_{\rm sig}^{2}\) signal events oscillating with a given frequency \(\Delta m_{s}\) (e.g. \(\Delta m_{s}=100\) ps\({}^{-1}\), which is far off the expected value for \(\Delta m_{s}\)), together with \(N_{B^{0}_{d}}=N_{B^{0}_{d}}^{1}+N_{B^{0}_{d}}^{2}\) background events oscillating with frequency \(\Delta m_{d}\) and \(N_{\rm cb}=N_{\rm cb}^{1}+N_{\rm cb}^{2}\) combinatorial events (no oscillations) is generated according to Eq. 4.

The uncertainty on the measurement of the transverse decay length, \(\sigma_{d_{xy}}\) (see Figure 4), and the true value of the \(g\)-factor, \(g_{0}\) (see Figure 8), are generated at random according to the distributions obtained from the simulated samples, fitted with appropriate combinations of Gaussian and exponential functions. From the computed true decay length, \(d_{xy}^{0}=t_{0}/g_{0}\), the corresponding reconstructed decay length is generated as \(d_{xy}=d_{xy}^{0}+S_{d_{xy}}\sigma_{d_{xy}}\Omega\). The reconstructed \(g\)-factor is generated as \(g=g_{0}+g_{0}S_{g}\Omega^{\prime}\). Both \(\Omega\) and \(\Omega^{\prime}\) are random numbers distributed according to the normal distribution.

From the transverse decay length and \(g\)-factor, the reconstructed proper time is then computed as \(t=gd_{xy}\). The probability for the event to be mixed or unmixed is determined from the \(t_{0}\) and \(\Delta m_{s}\) respectively \(\Delta m_{d}\) values using the expression \(\left(1-\cos(\Delta m_{j}t_{0})/\cosh(\Delta\Gamma_{j}t_{0}/2)\right)/2\) left out from Eq. 4 after the exponential part is extracted.

For a fraction of the events, selected at random, the state is interchanged between mixed and unmixed, according to the wrong-tag fraction \(\omega_{\rm tag}\). Half of the combinatorial events are added to the mixed events and half to the unmixed events.

For the \(D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) decay and the exclusive \(B_{d}^{0}\) background channels as well as the combinatorial background, the reconstructed proper time is generated assuming that it has the same distribution as the one for \(B_{s}^{0}\) mesons coming from the \(D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) sample.

### Results on \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement limits

The \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement limits are obtained applying the amplitude fit method [14] to the 'data sample' generated as described in the previous section. According to this method a new parameter, the \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillation amplitude \({\cal A}\), is introduced in the likelihood function by replacing the term '\(\mu_{0}\cos\Delta m_{s}t_{0}\)' with '\(\mu_{0}{\cal A}\cos\Delta m_{s}t_{0}\)' in the \(B_{s}^{0}\) probability density function given by Eq. 4. For each value of \(\Delta m_{s}\), the new likelihood function is minimized with respect to \({\cal A}\), keeping all other parameters fixed, and a value \({\cal A}\pm\sigma_{\cal A}^{\rm stat}\) is obtained. One expects, within the estimated uncertainty, \({\cal A}=1\) for \(\Delta m_{s}\) close to its true value, and \({\cal A}=0\) for \(\Delta m_{s}\) far from the true value. A 5 \(\sigma\) measurement limit is defined as the value of \(\Delta m_{s}\) for which \(1/\sigma_{\cal A}=5\), and a sensitivity at 95% confidence level as the value of \(\Delta m_{s}\) for which \(1/\sigma_{\cal A}=1.645\). Limits are computed with the statistical uncertainty \(\sigma_{\cal A}^{\rm stat}\). A detailed investigation on the systematic uncertainties \(\sigma_{\cal A}^{\rm syst}\), which affects the measurement of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillation, is presented in [5].

For the nominal set of parameters (as defined in the previous sections), \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}=0\) and an integrated luminosity of 30 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) the amplitude \(\pm 1\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}^{\mathrm{stat}}\) is plotted as a function of \(\Delta m_{s}\) in Fig. 10. The 95% CL sensitivity to measure \(\Delta m_{s}\) is found to be 30.5 \(\mathrm{ps}^{-1}\). This value is given by the intersection of the dashed line, corresponding to 1.645 \(\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}^{\mathrm{stat}}\) with the \(\mathcal{A}=1\) horizontal line.

From Fig. 10, which shows the significance of the measurement \(S(\Delta m_{s})=1/\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}\) as a function of \(\Delta m_{s}\), the 5\(\sigma\) measurement limit is found to be 22 \(\mathrm{ps}^{-1}\).

The dependence of the \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement limits on the integrated luminosity is shown in Fig. 11, with the numerical values given in Table 2.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline Lumi & 5\(\sigma\) limit & 95\% CL sensitiv. \\ (\(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)) & (\(\mathrm{ps}^{-1}\)) & (\(\mathrm{ps}^{-1}\)) \\ \hline
3 & 10.3 & 21.6 \\
5 & 13.2 & 23.8 \\
10 & 16.5 & 26.5 \\
20 & 20.0 & 29.0 \\
30 & 21.9 & 30.5 \\
40 & 23.2 & 31.4 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: The dependence of \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement limits on the integrated luminosity.

The dependence of the \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement limits on \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}/\Gamma_{s}\) is determined for an integrated luminosity of \(30\ {\rm fb}^{-1}\), other parameters having their nominal value. The \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}/\Gamma_{s}\) is used as a fixed parameter in the amplitude fit method. As shown in Fig. 12 no sizeable effect is seen up to \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}/\Gamma_{s}\ <\ 50\%\).

## 5 Conclusions

In this note the performance of the \(B^{0}_{s}\to D^{-}_{s}(\phi\,\pi^{-})\,\pi^{+}\) channel is used to calculate the 95% CL exclusion and 5 \(\sigma\) measurement limits of the \(B^{0}_{s}\) oscillation frequency as a function of the integrated luminosity collected with the ATLAS detector. The limits are updated for the detector geometry of "initial layout" using full Rome statistics, but only statistical errors are taken into account. With an integrated luminosity from 10 to 20 \({\rm fb}^{-1}\) a 5 \(\sigma\) measurement for a range of \(16.5<\Delta m_{s}\ <20\ {\rm ps}^{-1}\) is possible, covering the recent results from the Tevatron collider.

The values obtained in this note for the measurement limits should be re-evaluated, taking into account changes in the detector geometry, especially "complete detector layout", and the evolving simulation and reconstruction software. \(D^{-}_{s}a^{+}_{1}\) and exclusive \(B^{0}_{d}\) background channels will be analysed independently and investigations looking at the performance of other interesting \(B^{0}_{s}\)-\(\bar{B}^{0}_{s}\) mixing channels, which might be included in the analysis, will be carried out.

Acknowledgment

We would like to thank our former colleagues V.M. Ghete and A. Nairz for their contributions to the development of the software code. The programs they have written for selecting and analysing the events as well as for determining the \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity are still very useful.
