[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:1]

Introduction

For several years, the Standard Model [1] has been in very good agreement with the experimental data. But, since many fundamental questions have not been satisfactorily answered yet and since there is a growing evidence that neutrinos should not be massless particles [2], the Standard Model is likely to be only a low-energy approximation of a more fundamental theory, for which the electroweak gauge group would be extended beyond \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}\).

In this paper, we discuss some prospects for observing and identifying the properties of new charged vector bosons (further referred to as \(W^{\prime}\)) in the multi-TeV range. The most attractive candidate for a charged \(W^{\prime}\) boson is coming from the Left-Right Symmetric Model [3], which restores the parity symmetry at high energy by extending the \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}\) electroweak gauge group of the Standard Model to \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)_{B\to L}\), with the hypercharge \(Y\) being identified as \(I_{3\,R}+(B\to L)/2\), where \(I_{3\,R}\), \(B\) and \(L\) are respectively the third component of \(SU(2)_{R}\), the baryonic number and the leptonic number. Note that the Left-Right Symmetric Model requires the existence of right-handed neutrinos, which can may help to account for the lightness of the ordinary left-handed neutrinos, provided they are Majorana fields [4]. More details on the search for right-handed new gauge bosons and right-handed Majorana neutrinos in ATLAS can be found in Ref. [5]. Up to now, no experimental evidence has been found for the production of \(W^{\prime}\). When assuming manifest left-right symmetry, i.e., the equality of the coupling constants and the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrices for left-handed and right-handed fermions, the analysis of the contribution of the right-handed currents to the \(K^{0}_{L}\)-\(K^{0}_{S}\) mass difference sets a limit of 1.6 TeV on the \(W^{\prime}\) mass [6]. At the Tevatron, searches for \(W^{\prime}\) bosons decaying leptonically lead to \(m_{W}~{}>~{}720\) GeV if right-handed neutrinos are light and this lower bound weakens to \(m_{W}~{}>~{}650\) GeV if \(m_{\nu_{R}}=m_{W}/2\)[7]. Note that \(W^{\prime}\) vector bosons can also arise from other theories such as the alternate left-right model of Ref. [8], the un-unified Standard Model of Ref. [9], models with separate \(SU(2)\) gauge factors for each generation (see Ref. [10]) and the \(SU(3)_{C}\otimes SU(3)_{L}\otimes U(1)\) model of Ref. [11]. We refer the reader to the original literature for more details.

In some models, the leptonic decays of \(W^{\prime}\) may be forbidden or very strongly suppressed. This is the case, for instance, of a right-handed \(W^{\prime}\) gauge boson with a right-handed neutrino \(\nu_{R}\) which is too heavy for \(W^{\prime}\to\ell_{R}\nu_{R}\) to occur. At LHC, the \(pp\to W^{\prime}\to jj\) channel is likely to have a very small signal-to-background ratio, because of the huge amount of QCD di-jet events. Thus, it seems interesting to evaluate the discovery capability for \(pp\to W^{\prime}\to WZ\). If \(W^{\prime}\) does not belong to the same gauge group as \(W\) and \(Z\), the \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\) coupling vanishes. But, after symmetry breaking, mixing between \(W^{\prime}\) and \(W\) may occur and one could thus observe \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\) decays, even if the \(W^{\prime}-W\) mixing angle generally remains small [12] (one can typically expect it to be of the order of \((m_{W}/m_{W^{\prime}})^{2}\)) and the same conclusion thus stands for the branching ratio of \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\). It has been shown in [13] that the channel \(Z^{\prime}\to WW\), which is also suppressed \(Z^{\prime}-Z\) mixing, allows discovery of a \(Z^{\prime}\) boson with SM couplings up to masses of 2.2 TeV.

In models of dynamically braking scenarios [14], the \(W^{\prime}\) vector boson may be considered as a resonance in the \(WZ\) channel, so the branching ratio of \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\) can naturally be large. However, in such a case, the production amplitude of \(W^{\prime}\) would be of the second electroweak order (as for \(WZ\) production) which again introduces a suppression factor of \((m_{W}/m_{W})^{2}\).

This paper is organized as follows. Sec. 2 describes the reference model used for this analysis. Sec 3 gives an overview of the ATLAS detector and of the reconstruction code which simulates its response. Then, Sec. 4 discusses the discovery potential which is associated to the cleanest channel, i.e, \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\rightarrow(\ell\nu_{t})(\ell\ell)\). Sec. 5 is devoted to the study of \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\rightarrow(jj)(\ell\ell)\) and \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\rightarrow(\ell\nu_{t})(jj)\) channels. Finally, a summary and conclusions are given in Sec. 6.

## 2 Description of the reference model

In this section, we describe the main properties of the \(W^{\prime}\) boson which will be used as a reference all along this study. In the following, we will assume that the couplings of \(W^{\prime}\) to quarks and leptons are the same as for the standard \(W\) gauge boson, while the \(W^{\prime}WZ\) coupling is suppressed by a factor of the form \((1/c)\times(m_{W^{\prime}}/m_{W})^{2}\) compared to the standard \(WWZ\) coupling, where \(c\) is a parameter of the order of one [15]. Thus, the partial decay widths of \(W^{\prime}\) are:

\[\Gamma(W^{\prime}\to f_{i}\vec{f}_{j})=N_{C}\times|V_{ij}|^{2}\times \frac{\alpha}{12sin^{2}\theta_{W}}\times m_{W}, \tag{1}\]

and

\[\Gamma(W^{\prime}\to WZ)=c^{2}\times\frac{\alpha}{48sin^{2}\theta_{W}} \times cos^{4}\theta_{W}\times m_{W}. \tag{2}\]

In these equations:

* \(N_{C}\) is a colour factor (3 for quarks and 1 for leptons),
* \(V_{ij}\) is the CKM matrix element associated to the \((q_{i};q_{j})\) pair (it is equal to 1 for the leptonic decays of \(W^{\prime}\)),
* \(\alpha=e^{2}/4\pi\) and \(cos\theta_{W}=m_{W}/m_{Z}\).

Figure 1 shows how the branching ratios of the various decay channels of \(W^{\prime}\) depend on \(c\). If \(c=1\), we refer to a SM-like situation. If one wants to estimate the discovery capability of ATLAS in other cases, then one has to look at the value of \((\sigma\times Br)\) for the observation of a given \(W^{\prime}\) at the \(5\sigma\) confidence level, relative to the corresponding value of \((\sigma\times Br)\) for a SM-like boson.

The PYTHIA 5.7 and JETSET 7.4 [16] Monte-Carlo programs have been used in order to generate \(pp\to W^{\prime}\to WZ\) events. The value of \(c\) is set through PARU(135) in the code (it is equal to one by default). In the SM-like situation, we computed the cross section of \(pp\to W^{\prime}\to WZ\) as a function of \(m_{W^{\prime}}\), as shown in Figure 2 (the CTEQ2L parton distribution functions were used and no K-factors were included). In the following, \(\ell\) will refer to either an electron or a muon. Three kinds of decay chains will be considered in this paper:

* \(pp\to W^{\prime}\to WZ\rightarrow(\ell\nu_{t})(\ell\ell)\) with a branching ratio of 1.4%,
* \(pp\to W^{\prime}\to WZ\rightarrow(jj)(\ell\ell)\) with a branching ratio of 4.6%,
* \(pp\to W^{\prime}\to WZ\rightarrow(\ell\nu_{t})(jj)\) with a branching ratio of 15.0%.

## 3 Description of the ATLAS detector

The ATLAS experiment consists of four major subsystems which are: a central inner detector [17] with a solenoidal magnetic field of 2 T [18], a lead-liquid argon sampling electromagnetic calorimeter with an accordion geometry [19], a hadronic calorimeter made with iron and scintillating tiles in the regions where the radiation level is low enough [20] and made with lead and liquid argon elsewhere [19], a muon spectrometer [21] with a toroidal magnetic field [22]. More details about the expected performance of ATLAS can be found in [23]. Starting from the output of PYTHIA, the detector response was simulated with the ATLFAST 1.57 code [24].

First, the transverse energies of all stable particles (except neutrinos and muons) are summed in calorimeter cells of a given granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\) (\(0.1\times\,0.1\) for \(|\eta\,|<3\) and \(0.2\times 0.2\) for \(|\eta|>3\)). Then, clusters are defined in decreasing order of \(E_{T}\), by adding all the cells in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.4\) around the cell with highest \(E_{T}\).

When a cluster matches a generated electron passing the selection criteria (\(p_{T}>5\) GeV/c and \(|\eta|<2.5\)) with \(\Delta R<0.1\), it is tagged as an electron and isolation cuts are applied: the electron must be separated by \(\Delta R>0.4\) from other clusters, the difference between the transverse energy collected in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the electron and the transverse energy of the original electron should not exceed 10 GeV. The energy of an isolated electron is then smeared by using the expected energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter, which is:

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E}=\frac{12\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{\sigma_{\mbox{\tiny{ noise}}}}{E_{T}}\oplus 0.7\%, \tag{3}\]

where the noise coefficient \(\sigma_{\mbox{\tiny{noise}}}\) is parametrized as in Ref. [25].

When a cluster is not identified as an electron or a photon, it is classified as a jet. Its energy is smeared according to a Gaussian distribution whose parameters are given by:

\[\frac{\sigma(E)}{E} = \frac{50\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 3\%\mbox{ for }|\eta|<3,\] \[\frac{100\%}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus 7\%\mbox{ for }|\eta|>3.\]

At high luminosity (\(10^{34}\mbox{ cm}^{-2}\mbox{s}^{-1}\)), a pile-up noise term is added in quadrature (\(\sigma_{pile\,-\,up}\) is \(7.5\mbox{ GeV}\) for a cone of radius \(\Delta R~{}=~{}0.4\)).

Jets are identified as \(b\)-jets if a \(b\)-quark of \(p_{T}>5\mbox{ GeV}/\mbox{c}\) is within a cone radius of 0.2 around the direction of the jet. For \(b\)-tagging efficiencies and rejection factors, a 53% global efficiency and a 91% global rejection of non \(b\)-jets are assumed.

At the generator level, each muon momentum is smeared according to a resolution which depends on the kinematical variables of the muon (\(p_{T}\), \(\eta\), \(\phi\)) and on the sub-detectors which are used, inner detector and muon spectrometer in our case. The parametrization for the muon momentum resolution derived from [26] is used. Three options for these parametrization are possible:

* The stand-alone Muon System momentum resolution is parametrized as a function of the \(p_{T}\), the azimuth \(\phi\) and the pseudorapidity, taking into account the effect of the toroidal magnetic field.
* The Inner Detector momentum resolution can be parametrized as \[\frac{\sigma_{PT}}{PT}=(0.0005\cdot p_{T}\oplus 0.012)\cdot(1+|\eta|^{10}/7000),\] (5)
* The combined measurement of the muon momentum is evaluated as \[p_{T} = \frac{1}{w}(\frac{p_{T}^{muo}}{\sigma_{muo}^{2}}+\frac{p_{T}^{track }}{\sigma_{track}^{2}}),\] (6) \[w = \frac{1}{\sigma_{muo}^{2}}+\frac{1}{\sigma_{track}^{2}}\] (7) where \(p_{T}\) denotes the muon transverse momentum after smearing, \(p_{T}^{muo}\) the muon momentum smeared with the resolution for the stand-alone Muon System and \(p_{T}^{track}\) the muon momentum after smearing with the Inner Detector resolution.

For all muons passing the selection criteria (\(p_{T}>6\mbox{ GeV}/\mbox{c}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\)), isolation cuts are applied: the muon must be separated by \(\Delta R>0.4\) from clusters, the difference between the transverse energy collected in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the muon and the transverse energy of the original muon should not exceed 10 GeV.

Finally, the missing transverse energy is calculated by summing the transverse momenta of all identified isolated photons, electrons and muons, of all jets, of clusters which were not accepted as jets, of non-isolated muons which were not added to any jet cluster, and of cells which were not used for cluster reconstruction (their energy is smeared with the same energy resolution as for the jets).

## 4 A study of \(pp\to W^{\prime}\to WZ\to(\ell\nu_{\ell})(\ell\ell)\)

In this section, we discuss the discovery potential of \(pp\to W^{\prime}\to WZ\to(\ell\nu_{\ell})(\ell\ell)\) in the ATLAS detector. This process is the cleanest channel, but it has a small branching ratio compared to the other decay modes involving \(W\to q\bar{q}\) or \(Z\to q_{i}\bar{q}_{j}\). We have studied this decay chain for a mass range of \(W^{\prime}\) extending from 500 GeV up to 3 TeV.

### Event generation

As it is rather time consuming to generate a whole bunch of background events, we divided the \(\hat{s}\) range into seven regions between 0 and 7 TeV at the partonic level by using the CKIN(1) and CKIN(2) variables in PYTHIA and we generated events in these regions separately. Then, the histograms of these different runs were normalized according to their cross section and combined all together. In the following, an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) will be considered.

### Event selection and reconstruction of the \(W^{\prime}\) boson

In the reconstruction step, only the events with three leptons (electrons or muons) in the final state, passing at least one trigger condition, are taken into account. The fractions of events with different numbers of isolated leptons in the final state are presented in Table 1 for various values of \(m_{W^{\prime}}\).

Since there is missing energy in the final state, because of the escaping neutrino, only the transverse mass distribution of \(W^{\prime}\) can be computed. For a \(W^{\prime}\) boson decaying into \((\ell\nu_{\ell})(\ell\ell)\), the transverse mass \(m_{T_{W^{\prime}}}\) is defined as:

\[m_{T_{W^{\prime}}}=\sqrt{(\sum_{i=1}^{3}E_{T\ell_{i}}+E_{T\nu_{\ell}})^{2}-( \sum_{i=1}^{3}p_{\ell\,t_{i}}+p_{\bar{\nu}\nu_{\ell}})^{2}-(\sum_{i=1}^{3}p_{y \ell_{i}}+p_{y\nu_{\ell}})^{2}}, \tag{8}\]with \(p_{\!\!x}=E_{T}\ cos\phi\) and \(p_{\!\!y}=E_{T}\ sin\phi\).

The transverse mass of \(W^{\prime}\) is calculated using the transverse momenta of the three leptons \((\ell_{1},\ell_{2},\ell_{3})\) in the final state. To make sure that these three leptons come from a \(W^{\prime}\) decaying into \(WZ\), the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons in the intermediate state are reconstructed with their associated lepton assignments. Since \(Z\) decays into two opposite-charge leptons and since the \(W\) decay yields to any charge in the final state, one always finds two leptons with the same charge and one lepton with the opposite charge, which certainly comes from \(Z\). This latter lepton is paired with one of two others in order to reconstruct the \(Z\) boson: from the two possible combinations, the pair that gives the closest value to the \(Z\) mass is assigned to \(Z\) and the remaining lepton is assigned to \(W\). The efficiency of this method has been calculated and is displayed in Table 2 for \(m_{\,W}=1000\) GeV: it is 95% for \(Z\), while it is 83% for \(W\). This is due to the production of a \(\tau\)-lepton in the decay of both bosons. Since \(\tau\) can decay into \(e\) or \(\mu\), it may happen that these leptons are interpreted as direct decay products of \(W\) and \(Z\). Nevertheless, it can be seen that the algorithm discriminates well between \(Z\) and \(W\) for the origin of the final state leptons.

In Figure 3 the invariant mass distribution of the \(Z\) boson as reconstructed at the detector level is shown with solid lines, while the distribution obtained with the correct assignment for the leptons is shown with dashed lines. Because the leptons that actually originate from \(\tau\)-lepton instead of \(Z\), have lower energies, it can be seen that their wrong assignment to the \(Z\) boson creates an asymmetric tail on the left-hand side of the peak.

In Figure 4 the transverse mass distribution of the remaining lepton and the missing energy (solid lines) is compared to the distribution obtained at the partonic level (dashed lines). Again, due to the same reason, one notices that the wrong lepton assigned to \(W\) leads to an accumulation of events at low masses.

### Reduction of the backgrounds

In the Standard Model, the main background sources for the \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\to(\ell\nu_{\ell})(\ell\ell)\) decay chain are the following ones:

* \(pp\to t\bar{t}\to WbW\bar{b}\to(\ell\nu_{\ell})(\ell\nu_{\ell}j)(\ell\nu_{ \ell})b\),
* \(pp\to WZ\to(\ell\nu_{\ell})(\ell\ell)\),
* \(pp\to ZZ\to(\ell\ell)(\ell\ell)\) with one misidentified lepton.

The \(t\bar{t}\) background is significantly reduced by requiring the presence of exactly 3 isolated leptons in the final state, because the soft lepton coming from the semileptonic decay of one of the \(b\)-quarks is non-isolated (the fraction of events that pass this condition is 1.82%). The \(ZZ\) background is similarly reduced by the same requirement (the fraction of events that pass this condition is 20.81%). The irreducible background is the direct production of \(WZ\)It can be reduced by applying some cuts on the \(p_{T}\) of the leptons and of the reconstructed \(Z\) boson.

Figure 5 shows the transverse mass distribution for the signal over the total background. Even when no kinematic cuts are applied, the signal can clearly be seen above the background, up to mass of 2.5 TeV. Some distributions of the physical observables for the signal of mass 1 TeV and background processes are shown in Figure 6. From these distributions a set of cuts has been optimized in order to increase the significance. Some of the cuts, like the cut on the transverse momentum of the leptons or of the \(Z\), depend on the \(W^{\prime}\) mass. Different cuts were tried and corresponding significances were calculated. The cuts displayed in Table 3 were found to be the most efficient ones.

In order to accomodate different couplings of other possible models, we have determined the limiting value of the coupling corresponding to a significance of \(5\sigma\). In Figure 7, we show the ratio of \((\sigma\times B)_{limit}\), the cross section required for a significance of \(5\sigma\), to \((\sigma\times B)_{SM}\), the cross section obtained with the SM couplings. It can be seen that the discovery limit for \(W^{\prime}\) is about 2.5 TeV for this decay channel with a SM-like situation.

### Reconstruction of the invariant mass of \(W^{\prime}\)

Since the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino at the detector level remains unknown, we cannot reconstruct the invariant mass of the \(W^{\prime}\) boson directly. But since \(\nu_{\ell}\) comes from \(W\) in the intermediate state, in the decay chain \(W\rightarrow\ell\nu_{\ell}\), we can first compute the unknown \(p_{z}\) of \(\nu_{\ell}\) using the \(W\) mass as constraint and then reconstruct the \(W^{\prime}\) boson. The constraint equation can be derived from:

\[m_{W}=\sqrt{(E_{\ell}+E_{\nu})^{2}-(p_{x_{\ell}}+p_{x_{\nu}})^{2}-(p_{y_{\ell }}+p_{y_{\nu}})^{2}-(p_{z\ell}+p_{z_{\nu}})^{2}}. \tag{9}\]

With the approximation that \(\ell\) and \(\nu_{\ell}\) masses are vanishing, the latter equation takes the following form:

\[m_{\,W}=\sqrt{2(E_{\ell}\cdot\,E_{\nu}-\overrightarrow{p_{\ell}}\ \cdot\ \overrightarrow{p_{\nu}})} \tag{10}\]

As \(E=p_{T}\ ch\,\eta\) and \(p_{z}=p_{T}\ sh\,\eta\), one finally finds:

\[m_{\,W}^{2}=(2p_{T_{l}}p_{T_{\nu}})[ch\,\eta_{\ell}\ ch\,\eta_{\nu}-cos(\phi_{ \ell}-\phi_{\nu})-sh\,\eta_{\ell}\ sh\,\eta_{\nu}]. \tag{11}\]

After some simple calculation, a quadratic equation for \(sh\,\eta\) is obtained:

\[sh^{2}\eta_{\nu}-(2\,A\,s\,h\,\eta_{\ell})\ sh\,\eta_{\nu}-A^{2}+ch^{2}\eta_{ \ell}=0, \tag{12}\]

where

\[A=(\frac{m_{\,W}^{2}}{2p_{T_{\ell}}p_{T_{\ell}}}+cos\,(\phi_{\ell}-\phi_{\nu})). \tag{13}\]By using the roots of this equation, we can derive the longitudinal component of the momentum of the neutrino as:

\[p_{z_{\nu}}=p_{T_{\nu}}\;sh\,\eta. \tag{14}\]

But a difficulty arises from the fact that the constraint equation is a quadratic one, thus giving two roots for \(p_{z_{\nu}}\). One of them is fake and does not represent the physical situation. The transverse mass distribution of \(W^{\prime}\) can be used in this case to choose the correct root, because it has an edge at \(m_{\,W^{\prime}}\), provided that the background has been sufficiently well reduced. Once we have derived the expected \(W^{\prime}\) mass value from the transverse mass distribution, we choose the root which leads to the invariant mass closest to \(m_{\,W^{\prime}}\).

Using this method on the signal and background events, the invariant mass distribution of the \(W^{\prime}\) is obtained. In this case background events are handled differently for each mass value when choosing the best root, so their distributions are different for each mass of the \(W^{\prime}\). Invariant mass distribution for 1 TeV \(W^{\prime}\) is shown on Figure 8 (top). For this distribution, background events spread also to high mass values, since in the algorihtm we choose the root closer to the signal mass. So even though we have a better signal with a sharp peak, background events become higher in the same region. Only after applying some cuts we can have acceptable significance. It turns out that the same cuts as for the transverse distribution give the best result. The invariant mass distribution of the 1 TeV signal after application of these cuts can be seen in Figure 8 (bottom).

Since the invariant mass of W' can be fully reconstructed, one can study the mass resolution issue. After fitting the signal with a gaussian distribution, the values in Table 4 are found for the mass resolution in terms of all leptons, only electrons and only muons in the final state before and after application of the cuts mentioned above. It appears that calculating the invariant mass does not improve the significance calculated in the transverse mass distribution, thus we can not extend the discovery limit found with the transverse mass distribution.

## 5 Study of \(W^{\prime}\ \to\ WZ\ \to\ l\nu_{l}jj,\ ljj\)

### Signal reconstruction

In this section, we consider the channel \(W^{\prime}\to\mathrm{WZ}\), with one boson decaying into leptons (\(Z\ \to\ ll\) and \(W\ \to\ l\nu_{l}\)) and the other decaying into jets. Decay modes involving \(W^{\pm}\), \(Z^{0}\)\(\to\mathrm{jets}\) have larger branching ratio than those with only leptons in the final state but suffer from serious backgrounds.

#### 5.1.1 Reconstruction of \(W/z\)\(\rightarrow\)\(jj\)

Given the experimental limits on the \(W^{\prime}\) mass, our analysis will concern the \(W^{\prime}\) masses in the TeV range (from 750 GeV to 4 TeV). The W and Z bosons from the decay of such a heavy \(W^{\prime}\) will have a large boost; typically, the distributions of the W and Z transverse momenta have a maximum at \(m_{\,W}/2\). This results in a pair of jets very close in space (see Figure 9), and difficult to separate in the detector. A special algorithm was implemented to reconstruct the hadronic decay of the high \(p_{T}\)\(W/Z\).

To reconstruct the high \(p_{T}\)\(W/Z\), which gives two severly overlapping jets, the energy is collected within a single cone [13, 27]. The invariant mass of the \(W/Z\) boson decaying into jets is evaluated by summing all cells in a big cone \(\Delta\)R, amongst the cones found, the one with the mass which is the closest to the mass of W or Z is chosen.

In the choice of the cone radius, one must be aware that a small cone can introduce the loss of a big fraction of the energy whereas the pile-up contribution at high luminosity will be amplified if a too big cone is used. A cone radius of \(\Delta\)R = 0.5 - 0.6 seems to be the optimal choice. The pile-up contribution at high luminosity is taken into account by adding in quadrature a pile-up noise term in the smearing procedure of each cell energy, this term depends on the cone size of the cell and its transverse momentum. The results of the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons decaying hadronically reconstruction, obtained for \(M_{W^{\prime}}=1\)\(TeV\) and \(\Delta\)R = 0.5, are shown in Figure 10.

#### 5.1.2 Reconstruction of \(W/z\)\(\rightarrow\) leptons

The transverse momentum of the \(W/Z\) decaying leptonically is more easy to reconstruct. In the case of \(W\ \rightarrow\ l\nu_{l}\), we assume that the neutrino \(p_{T}\) is given by the missing transverse momentum. In this case, we only reconstruct the transverse mass of the lepton-neutrino system whereas in the case of a Z leptonic decay, the invariant mass of the system can be found. In both cases, the \(W^{\prime}\) transverse mass is reconstructed (Figure 10d).

### Reduction of the backgrounds

The main backgrounds are:

* The QCD background consisting of \(W/Z\ +\ jets\), in this case the \(W/Z\) decays leptonically (\(W\ \rightarrow\ l\nu_{l}\) or \(Z\ \rightarrow\ ll\)). This backgound becomes dangerous when the two jets have an invariant mass close to the \(W/Z\) mass. The cross section of this processes is \(23.5\times 10^{4}\) pb. This value corresponds to the cross section given by PYTHIA increasedby a K-factor of 1.5 to account for higher-order corrections to high-\(p_{T}\)\(W/Z\ +\ jets\) production [28].
* t\(\overline{t}\) background: in this case we have two real W's, with a total cross section of about 600 pb. The t\(\overline{t}\) background can be reduced using the presence of b-jets in the final state.
* The WW, WZ and ZZ continuum: the cross section of the WW, WZ and ZZ pair production is 107.5 pb. This background has a much lower rate than the W, Z + jets and \(t\overline{t}\) backgrounds but is irreducible in the central region.

#### 5.2.1 Central cuts

To ensure an efficient background rejection, one has to select events with high \(p_{T}\) central \(W/Z\) and leptons, which are expected to come from the \(W^{\prime}\) decay. In the following \(p_{T}^{lep}\) denotes the \(p_{T}\) of the \(W\) or \(Z\) boson decaying leptonically and \(p_{T}^{had}\) the \(p_{T}\) of the \(W\) or \(Z\) boson decaying hadronically. At this stage of the analysis, not knowing the \(W^{\prime}\) mass, some of the cuts are defined as a function of the reconstructed invariant mass \(m_{W^{\prime}}^{rec}\) in each event. In the case of \(W^{\prime}\ \to\ WZ\ \to\ l ljj\), \(m_{W^{\prime}}^{rec}\) is reconstructed directly. In the case of the \(W^{\prime}\ \to\ WZ\ \to\ l\nu_{l}jj\), the constraint that the invariant lepton-neutrino mass be equal to \(M_{W}\) gives two solutions for the longitudinal momentum of the neutrino. The solution with the smaller value was found to agree generally better with the true value generated, and was therefore used to estimate the invariant mass \(m_{W^{\prime}}^{rec}\) in each event at this stage of the analysis. A set of cuts, called central or high \(p_{T}\) cuts, has been optimised in terms of statistical significance of the signal above the background:

* \(M_{W/Z\to jj}=M_{W/Z}\ \pm\) 15 GeV and \(M_{Z\to ll}=M_{Z}\ \pm\) 15 GeV
* \(p_{T}^{l_{1}}\) and \(p_{T}^{l_{2}}>m_{W^{\prime}}^{rec}/10\)
* \(p_{T}^{lep}\) and \(p_{T}^{had}>m_{W^{\prime}}^{rec}/3\)

#### 5.2.2 Central jets veto

To improve the significance, a jet veto in the central region can be applied, mainly to reject the \(t\overline{t}\) background which is expected to have large central jet activity due to the b-quark coming from the top decay [29, 30]. After central events selection, the events containing central jets (\(|\eta_{j}|<2.0\)), with \(p_{T}>p_{T}^{thr}\), are rejected. After identification of the cluster coming from the hadronic decay of \(W/Z\), the central jets are reconstructed using a standard cone algorithm with \(\Delta\)R=0.4. The veto efficiency depends on the choice of the \(p_{T}^{thr}\) value,this dependence is sketched in Figure 11, for the signal and the backgrounds (\(W/Z+jets\) and \(t\overline{t}\)), in the low and high luminosity cases. We can clearly see that the \(t\overline{t}\) background is strongly reduced by this veto while the signal is slightly affected.

For low values of \(p_{T}^{thr}\), the high luminosity efficiency is smaller than the one in the low luminosity case. For \(p_{T}^{thr}>25\) GeV, the low and high luminosity cases have the same efficiencies, a \(p_{T}^{thr}\) of 30 GeV can be used at high luminosity.

Some differences between the efficiencies obtained by fast simulations and those extracted from full simulations [31] have been observed. Thus, for the discovery potential estimation, the veto efficiencies are taken from the full simulations results. At high luminosity, the surviving efficiency is about 60% for the signal, 37% for W/Z + jets, 15% for \(t\overline{t}\) and 55% for the VV continuum (V = W or Z).

After applying all cuts described above, we can estimate the statistical significance as a function of \(M_{W}\). From figure 7, one can see that the channel \(W^{\prime}\ \to\ WZ\ \rightarrow\ l\nu_{l}jj,\ ljj\) allows the discovery of the \(W^{\prime}\) boson with SM couplings up to masses about 2.3 TeV. This limit is slightly lower than the discovery limit obtained for the \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\ \rightarrow lll\nu_{l}\) decay, due to the higher level of the background.

### Reconstruction of the \(W^{\prime}\) invariant mass

The \(W^{\prime}\) invariant mass can be reconstructed directly in the decay \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\ \rightarrow lljj\) whereas in the case of \(W^{\prime}\to WZ\to l\nu_{l}jj\), the \(W^{\prime}\) mass can be obtained, as in the previous section, by constraining \(p_{\nu}^{l}\) to yield an invariant mass of the lepton-neutrino system equal to the mass of the W boson.

In the previous step of the analysis, the smaller of the two calculated values of \(p_{\nu}^{l}\) was chosen since the \(W^{\prime}\) mass was not supposed to be known. If the \(W^{\prime}\) boson has been discovered, the solution which yields the invariant mass closer to the expected \(W^{\prime}\) mass extracted from the transverse mass distribution can be used. Shown in Figure 12 is the invariant mass spectra for a 1.5 TeV \(W^{\prime}\) boson together with the contribution from the residual background. The artificial peak, around the \(W^{\prime}\) mass, in the background distribution comes from the choice of the reconstructed mass closer to \(m_{W^{\prime}}\).

## 6 Conclusions

We reported on the feasibility of detecting the \(W^{\prime}\) boson in the \(W^{\prime}\ \rightarrow\ WZ\) channel, which is not the principal discovery channel, but can help to understand the origin of the new gauge bosons. Decay chains involving only leptons, or leptons and jets, in the final state have been considered. The discovery limits estimated for the different decay chains show that, for an integrated luminosity of \(300\,fb^{-1}\), the SM \(W^{\prime}\) boson can be observed in the WZ channel up to masses of 2.8 TeV. The discovery limits found in this study can be used to obtain discovery limits of other generic resonances, arising from other models, in the WZ channel.
