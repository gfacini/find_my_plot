**A Possible Design Concept for Atlas Si Tracker / Vertex Detector**

**and Design Considerations**

We assume here that Si strips occupy a radial region from R\({}_{i}\) = 6 cm to R\({}_{0}\) = 60 cm in order to allow enough length for a high performance Straw Tube Tracker.

We assume that sensors have a uniform technology and size and differ only in pitch and readout pitch for different layers. It might be considered using possible interstrip capacitance enhancement schemes (under study) for detectors with the largest readout pitch, in order to minimise unwanted capacitive coupling of signal collected on intermediate strips to the backplane and at the same time keep noise as low as possible.

The estimated overall material thickness per layer of Si strips is at present estimated to correspond to 1.9% of a radiation length. The Si sensor itself represents only 0.22% of a radiation length. It will be most important to work on the mechanical and electrical layout of modules to decrease the material (radiation length). The exploitation of Landau correlations for pattern recognition will be difficult in LHC conditions, since S/N ratios of at least 40:1 are necessary. For these reasons at present only single-sided sensors are considered for most of the tracker. If it can be demonstrated that the radiation length of one silicon strip layer can be reduced to \(\lesssim\) 1%, e.g. by using Kevlar supports and evaporative cooling, the use of double sided detectors has to be reconsidered for the whole detector. Some layers with double-sided readout detectors may be advantageous in any case for physics reasons and the development of this technology should be further pursued in RD projects.

The basic technology for single-sided detectors considered is : Capacitively-coupled strips (oxide, or oxide-nitride about 200 nm thick), punch-through bias with FOXFET gate, graded guard-ring and n\({}^{+}\) contact on p-side. The assumed size of the sensors is 6.4 \(\times\) 6.4 cm\({}^{2}\)[1]. We believe that for this type of sensor production costs of DC-coupled and AC-coupled sensors are very similar (discussions with CSEM and Hamamatsu indicate that there should be no difference). For quantities of 5000 to 10 000 sensors, a price of 20 CHF/cm\({}^{2}\) is assumed.

Six layers of one r\(\phi\) and one z measurement are assumed. This assumption is made only to be able to make a channel count. The question of r\(\phi\),z versus small angle stereo or of a mixed system has to addressed in a detailed simulation study. The exact radial position and length of each layer has also to be determined from simulation. A guess is made here on a reasonable radius foreach layer. Two of the layers are high precision for vertexing and four layers are designed with a spatial resolution adequate for good tracking. A tentative layout is shown in Table 1 and Fig. 1.

The position of layer 1 and 2 is chosen to give a good impact parameter resolution. This design assumes that there are 3 to 4 Si wheels between z = \(\pm\) 70 cm and z = \(\pm\) 100 cm and r = 30 cm up to r = 65 cm, to deal with tracking at higher \(\eta\). The usefulness and geometry of such wheels will have to be studied.

Here we assume to have a base-line pixel layer at r = 11.5 cm (a second pixel layer at r = 14.5 cm is feasible in this layout but for the time being is not implemented in the simulations) with pixels of 50 \(\mu\)m \(\times\) 200 \(\mu\)m. The pixels will provide good resolution and pattern recognition capabilities. In case of difficulties with this solution at an early stage, one can envisage a double layer of high precision r\(\phi\),z strips, in particular for early B-physics running. This double layer would correspond to about 7% of all strips in this proposal.

The layer at r = 6 cm has to be removed for high luminosity running.

A cost estimate for this design is presented in Table 2 with a comparison of the costs for the Coseners House design.

**The Layer 1 for Optimal B-physics Performance**

It seems possible to perform very important B-physics studies, - e.g. measurement of CP-violation parameters in specific exclusive B-decays - at integrated luminosities of a few 10\({}^{40}\)cm\({}^{-2}\) during the first few years of LHC running. Radiation damage considerations indicate that one might be able to run Si detectors at rather small radii down to 6 - 8 cm for the first few years (Fig. 2 shows the projected depletion voltage, expected to be the main factor in determining the detector lifetime). This scenario demands special efforts to build specific instrumentation just for this purpose in order to perform the best possible physics. Once this specific programme has been finished, one would remove this part of the detector. It is even conceivable to replace this part of the detector once during the first 2 to 3 years of running. Several options could prove quite attractive :

a) Layer 1 could be one layer r\(\phi\) or two layers (r\(\phi\), z) with very good spatial resolution These layers could be of the standard type.

b) Since multiple scattering is a limiting factor in performance concerning impact parameter resolution in r\(\phi\) and z, one might consider a different construction of layers at the innermost radius. It seems feasible to make ladders of 18 cm or 24 cm length with readout on both far z-ends for both r\(\phi\) and z-coordinates. Back-to-back single-sided detectors can be considered, with double-metal technology for re-routing to allow both sides to be read out along the ladder. For an \(\eta\) coverage of \(\pm\)1.5, a LEP type geometry with no readout electronics in the sensitive area is attractive. It has been demonstrated at LEP that one can reach a radiation length of \(\lambda\) = 0.35 per layer including all supports. This solution would allow r\(\phi\) and z coordinate measurement with a resolution of 10 \(\mu\)m and constants in the multiple scattering term of below 100.

- c) The optimal solution could be the same scheme as in b), but with double-sided double-metal detectors. This would limit the radiation length to 0.65% for one layer with both precise r\(\phi\)
- and z-measurement. Using floating power supplies on the z-strip electronics (to eliminate the potential problem of breakdown) makes this proposal look trivial in comparison with technical problems encountered by the SDC vertex detector concept. The necessary ending support structure for the low multiple scattering layer proposed in b) and c) has to be designed with minimal material requirements. beryllia-oxide substrates for chip support and beryllium endrings can be made such that a particle traversing this area will see an average of around 3% of a radiation length (as seen along the track). The corresponding rapidity coverage of such an endring structure is estimated to be between \(\eta\)=1.8 and \(\eta\)=2.1. It should be noted that z-ambiguities in the innermost layer coming from necessary on-detector multiplexing in the z-coordinate can very likely be easily resolved from the 3 z-coordinate measurements in the outer Si layers. Pattern recognition studies on this question will be done in the very near future.

**Performance of the Proposed Layout and Its Implications for Physics**

Resolution and placement of various tracking layers as well as their radiation length were taken into account. Calculations were done for \(\theta=90^{\circ}\) tracks.

The following layer arrangement was used :

\begin{tabular}{||c||c|c|c|c||} \hline \hline Strip & Radius & Layer Type & X/X\({}_{0}\) & Resolution \\ Layer & [cm] & & [\%] & (r\(\phi\times\) z) [\(\mu\)m] \\ \hline \hline
1 & 6 & strips 50 / 50 \(\mu\)m & 0.7 & 10 - 10 \\ \hline  & 11.5 & \(50\times 200\)\(\mu\)m pixels & 1.5 & \(20\times 60\) \\ \hline

It is assumed that a straw tracker occupies radii between 65 and 105 cm. For sake of calculations, it is modelled here by two points giving an r\(\phi\) measurement with 60 \(\mu\)m precision each. A beam pipe thickness of 0.3% X/X0 and a radius of 5 cm were assumed.

Resolutions taken for the pixel layer correspond to the _"digital"_ values (no interpolation between pixels assumed), allowing some error in alignment.

For strip detectors with 200 \(\mu\)m pitch, a conservative value of 60 \(\mu\)m resolution is used. It is expected that using capacitive charge coupling from intermediate strips to readout strips, a better performance can be reached(2). For 100 \(\mu\)m pitch, a 30 \(\mu\)m resolution was assumed on the same basis. For a pitch of 50 \(\mu\)m, however, we can use a value of 10 \(\mu\)m, which is 25% worse than achieved in the existing DELPHI vertex detector.

The proposed layout has very good transverse momentum resolution :

\[\frac{\Delta p_{\perp}}{p_{\perp}}=3.4\bullet 10^{-4}\times p_{\perp}\oplus 1.0\ \%\]

assuming 20 \(\mu\)m accuracy for the position of the primary vertex.

Resolutions in impact parameter and z, as well as momentum resolution without the vertex constraint, depend on the arrangement of the vertexing layers. A few possibilities were tried; the table below summarizes the results :

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{**Impact**} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{\(\Delta p/p^{2}\)**} \\
**Layers Present** & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{**Parameter**} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{**z**} & \multicolumn{1}{c|}{**No Vertex**} \\
**R = 6 cm** & **R = 11.5 cm** & **Resolution [\(\mu\)m]** & **Resolution [\(\mu\)m]** & **Constraint** \\ \hline \hline Yes & Yes & 14 \(\pm\) & 72 \(\pm\) & 83 \(\pm\) & 4.4\(\bullet\)10-4 \\ \hline Yes & No & 15 \(\pm\) & 74 \(\pm\) & 12 \(\pm\) & 64 \(\pm\) & 4.4\(\bullet\)10-4 \\ \hline No & Yes & 35 \(\pm\) & 190 \(\pm\) & 43 \(\pm\) & 220 \(\pm\) & 7.2\(\bullet\)10-4 \\ \hline No & No & 50 \(\pm\) & 390 \(\pm\) & 49 \(\pm\) & 340 \(\pm\) & 9.1\(\bullet\)10-4 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The first two combinations, with the layer present at 6 cm are valid for the initial period of low luminosity running. They are characterized by the excellent impact parameter and z resolution. A low value of the multiple scattering term is of great importance for B-physics. This term dominates resolutions for low p\({}_{\perp}\) tracks, which are essential for efficient B decay reconstruction. Recent studies show that the presence of a low material precision layer at R = 6 cm can increase the acceptance for B decay reconstruction by 50%, compared to the Coseners House design [2].

The pixel layer at R = 11.5 cm has 50 \(\upmu\)m pitch in r\(\phi\) and 200 \(\upmu\)m pitch in z. While this layer may be useful for track finding, it does not contribute significantly to the impact parameter measurement. On the other hand, the z resolution is deteriorated because of increased material.

For highest luminosity, it might be necessary to remove an innermost strip layer. In such a case, with a layer at 11.5 cm still present, the resolutions are comparable to the present design. Absence of the second pixel layer (at 14.5 cm in the present ATLAS Baseline) decreases the total material and reduces multiple scattering at the expense of losing one measurement. The resolutions are therefore slightly worse for high p\({}_{\perp}\) tracks, but a bit better for lower momentum tracks.

For even higher luminosity operation, if there cannot be a tracking layer below R = 20 cm, the resolutions deteriorate significantly. In such conditions, no useful secondary vertex measurement can be provided for slow tracks. It should however be possible to continue B-physics studies with higher p\({}_{\perp}\) cuts (lower acceptance compensated by higher luminosity).

Processes which can only be studied at higher luminosity involve heavier particles; for instance the Higgs boson. For such particles decay products have higher momenta. Rejection of important heavy quark background for these processes can therefore be done, even with limited secondary vertex measurement accuracy [3].
