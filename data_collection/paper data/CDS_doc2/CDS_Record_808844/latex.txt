_Abstract_

**By measuring the position of the optical centers of the RASNIK mask, lens and sensor blocks, the data from the eight projective systems, used in H8, can be converted in alignment parameters. The intrinsic absolute precision of the projective alignment systems is better than 4 um.**

## 1 The projective alignment systems in the ATLAS/Muon Barrel spectrometer

### Principle

In order to measure the momentum of high-energetic muons with adequate precision, the position of the middle chambers, with respect to the inner and outer chambers, should be known with a proportional precision. The projective alignment systems, with their optical axis pointing to the interaction point, are monitoring these positions. Ideally, all four chamber corners of each chamber are connected to a projective alignment system. The number of RASNIK systems [1], required for this layout, is reduced by a factor 3 by creating chamber layer units in which typically six chambers are 'unified' by means of the 'praxial' RASNIK systems. The alignment of such a chamber layer is measured by means of 8 projective systems. As a result there is redundant data for the alignment of each of the middle chambers with respect their inner and outer partners.

In the barrel muon spectrometer, the projective systems are placed outside the chamber's envelope. Each system is situated in a local (R,\(\varphi\)) plane (see fig 1). The components of the projective alignment systems are mounted on 'extension plates', which, in their turn, are mounted on 'projective platforms'. The tip of an extension plate is supposed to position the RASNIK projective components precisely with respect to the wires in the chamber. Three steel balls on the tip define the local (R,\(\varphi\))plane, and one sphere fixes the RASNIK component in two directions in this plane (see fig 2). In this way, the RASNIK blocks are fixed precisely in all 5 relevant degrees of freedom. If the chambers are placed in their nominal positions then the three (R,\(\varphi\)) planes, associated with one projective system, are co-planar, and the three fixing spheres lie on one line. A projective RASNIK system placed on these spheres should read zero after correcting the raw image position data for offsets. The goal of the calibration procedure, described in this paper, is the measurement of these offsets.

### The projective systems in H8

H8 includes only a small part of an ATLAS chamber sector. Instead of a complete layer unit, formed by six inner, six middle and six outer (large) chambers, only two inner, two middle and two outer (large) chambers are placed in position. This (lowest rapidity) section would, in ATLAS, be equipped with only four projective systems. We compensated for the missing alignment data from the systems on non-present chambers by adding four projective systems.

## 2 The method of calibration

For ATLAS, the target maximum alignment contribution to the uncertainty of the sagitta is set at 30 \(\upmu\)m [2]. With a precision of the calibration of the offsets in terms of a transversal lens displacement of 15 \(\upmu\)m, the calibration error would not contribute to the total error in a significant way. This corresponds to an error of 30 \(\upmu\)m in terms of transversal mask displacements.

### Direct calibration & the calibration station

**A straightforward calibration method** would be to place the three components in their relative nominal positions and to record, in that situation, the RASNIK readout values. This method is not practical because 1) a costly 6.5 m long granite table, and a straight edge with the same length would be required, with a flatness and straightness better than 10 \(\upmu\)m and b) high-precision mechanics is required as interface between the granite surfaces and the support plates of the RASNIK blocks.

**The Calibration Station**. Instead of a large granite table, we use a steel tube with a square cross section, as is shown in fig 3. It is supported by means of two fixed spheres at one side and by a cylinder at the opposite side. This kinematical support allows the different thermal expansion of the tube and its supports. By means of a fan, air is continuously flowing through the tube, reducing thermal gradients within the tube.

With clamps, the support mechanics for the RASNIK blocks can be fixed at any position along the bar (see fig 4). This facilitates the mounting of systems with 13 different focal lengths. The support mechanics includes the high precision sphere and three steel balls that define the (R,\(\varphi\)) plane, identical to the tips of the extension plates. By means of three fine-threaded clamping wheels, the rotation of the (R,\(\varphi\)) plane around the Y and Z axis can be adjusted, with a bubble level, until three planes of three platforms are horizontal, thus parallel.

The straightness of the bas was monitored with two permanent RASNIK systems mounted on each side of the tube.

**The alignment of the tips** is defined in terms of the distance in X and Y of the mask sphere with respect to the line through the sensor and lens spheres. This alignment is measured using special high-precision square blocks, called 'quad' blocks, as explained below. The RASNIK blocks, used in H8, are calibrated by comparing their individual response with the response of a corresponding quad block. The alignment of the block supports does not play a role, and the coarse alignment of the calibration station of some mm is left as such.

### The Coordinate systems

For the coordinate systems we use the following orientations (see fig 5):

X Normal to projective block support plane (corresponds to the ATLAS local (R,\(\varphi\)) plane); points positive from optical center towards support plane Y makes right-handed system with X and Z Z points (positive) from mask center to sensor center rotX rotation around X axis, taken positive if corkscrew points to positive X rotY rotation around Y axis, taken positive if corkscrew points to positive Y rotZ rotation around Z axis, taken positive if corkscrew points to positive Z

For practical reasons we distinguish three coordinate systems:

PCS: Projective Coordinate System: see above;

RCS: RASNIK Coordinate System: as PCS, but X and Y are (slightly) rotated due to the mask rotation around the Z axis;

CCS: Calibration Coordinate System: as RCS, with mask rotation fixed on the value of the mask rotation of the quad mask block.

### Calibration Parameters

The RASNIK image data is converted into 4 relevant parameters: two image position parameters (X and Y), the image scale parameter (S) and the value for the image rotation (rotZ); this value equals the differential rotation around the Z axis of the mask and the sensor.

First, we define an origin on the sensor. The X and Y values, extracted from a RASNIK image equal the mask grid values of this image point. If we rotate the sensor around the Z-axis through this origin, only the value for rotZ will change, and we thus may consider the chosen sensor origin as its optical center.

The optical center of the lens is simply defined as the point, through which a passing light beam does not change direction. Rotating a lens around the Z axis through the optical center will not change any of the 4 RASNIK values. Note that for the sensor and lens blocks, the optical center will deviate from the'mechanical' centers, situated 45.000 mm above the block support plane, straight above the precision sphere.

The mask has no optical center: it can be regarded as a graph. The optical axis of a RASNIK system (defined by the optical centers of the sensor and lens) crosses the mask in a point (X,Y), where X and Y are the two translation output parameters. Note that these values do not change if the mask is rotated around this point.

For ATLAS, a unit of a mask, lens and sensor block could be calibrated. This would, however, not allow to exchange one block of a system with a block of another system. We calibrated, therefore, each individual mask, lens or sensor block. The calibration values for a sensor block and a lens block consist of the distances, in X and Y, between the optical and'mechanical' centers. The calibration values of the mask block correspond to the mask reading at the mechanical center.

### Block rotation around the X axis.

When mounted on their supports, the RASNIK blocks (and quad calibration blocks) can rotate freely around the X axis. By placing the optical center in this axis, the RASNIK readout is independent, in the first order, of rotX. For the mask this is true if the X axis lies in the mask pattern plane.

Before they were mounted in H8, the spacers in the RASNIK blocks were adjusted such that the distance, in Z, between the optical centers, and the X axis through the central sphere hole, was smaller than 0.1 mm. This verification was a part of the calibration of the H8 projective systems.

In fig 6 an off-center mask is shown, together with the extrapolated axis through the optical centers of the lens and sensor. The change in the measured Y coordinate equals:

\[\mathrm{dY}\ =\ \mathrm{H/cos(\alpha)+D\ \ tg(\alpha)}\ \ \equiv\ \ \mathrm{\nu_{2}\ H \alpha^{2}+D\ \alpha}\]

Fig 7 shows Y\({}_{\mathrm{meas}}\) as a function of rotX (= \(\alpha\)) for a typical H8 mask block. From the parabola fit the H and D values can be derived. H is determined by the station alignment and the positions of the optical centers of the lens and sensor blocks, and irrelevant (note, however, that the value for H is obtained from a simple rotation of the mask block). The value for D was found to be smaller than 0.13 mm for all mask blocks.

A similar relation holds for the sensor blocks, although a correction factor must be applied for the conversion of the RASNIK Y measurement:

\[\mathrm{dY}_{\mathrm{SEN}}=\mathrm{-S\.\ dY}_{\mathrm{meas}}\.\]

where S is the image scale. Since the sensor blocks were equipped with shielding tubes, rotX was limited to +/- 0.034 rad. We could, therefore, not verify the D values of the SEN blocks precisely. For this, we rely on the adjustment procedure before the H8 installation (performed prior to the mounting of the shielding tubes). Moreover, in H8, rotX of the sensor blocks was adjusted to give a proper image without shadow of the shielding entrance window, so \(\mathrm{rotX}_{\mathrm{MSK}}<0.034\) rad, for all mask blocks.

For the lens blocks, the maximum rotX is limited to +/- 0.04 rad: beyond this limit the image quality is too poor for proper analysis. Measuring D this way is not practical. Instead of a small rotation we turned the lens block by 180 deg. around the vertical (X) axis, resulting is a displacement of the optical center. The apparent lens displacement in the direction of the optical (Z) axis before and after the rotation equals 2 D, and can be calculated from the change in the scale of the images:\[\mathrm{dZ}\ =\ \mathrm{(b\text{-v S})/(S+1)}\]

in which dZ equals the distance, in Z, between the actual position of the lens and its nominal position; v equals the object distance, b equals the image distance and S the actual image scale.

From the change in scale, shown in fig 8, one can derive that the spacers between the lens mount and the calibration block should be reduced by 1.62 mm.

**Conclusions.**_By means of a small stepwise rotation around the X axis, we can verify that the values of D for the sensor and mask blocks are sufficiently small. The same verification can be done for the lens blocks by means of a rotation of 180 deg around the X-axis._

## 3 The Calibration of the Quad Blocks

### The Quad Blocks.

The quad calibration blocks are shown in figs 9a and 9b. The tolerances in the side dimension, planar parallelism, rectangularity, hole position and hole axis direction were designed to limit the calibration errors to be smaller than 5 \(\upmu\)m, but the manufacturer only guaranteed this value to be better than 10 \(\upmu\)m.

During our measurements, it became clear that the tolerances are much better than 10 \(\upmu\)m. We measured the quad blocks with our own 3D measurement machine, and we could not measure deviations larger than the machine errors, nominally 4 \(\upmu\)m.

We equipped one square block with an illuminated mask, one with a lens and one with an image sensor, respectively. In H8, lenses with four different focal lengths were used; we used one quad block for all lens types, respectively.

We measured the X and Y calibration parameters by recording the RASNIK readout values at different orientations A, B, C and D (rotating positive in steps of 90 deg. around the Z axis) of the blocks.

### The RASNIK response for the quad mask block

Here, the RASNIK X points either up or down, and the RASNIK Y is always horizontal (left or right) as is depicted in fig 10. The X and Y directions are set by the orientation of the sensor block, which is in its standard rotational position, for these measurements [3]. The up/down and left/right directions are defined by the (A,B,C,D) orientations of the mask. The +X and +Y RASNIK arrows in fig 10 indicate the directions in which one reads a larger value from the mask. Note that one reads a _smaller_ X or Y value if the mask quad block is moved in a positive direction.

The calibration values of the mask quad block are X\({}_{\mathrm{cen}}\) and Y\({}_{\mathrm{cen}}\), being the coordinates of the center of the (X,Y) plane of the block. We define X\({}_{\mathrm{off}}\) and Y\({}_{\mathrm{off}}\) as the distances in X and Y between the center of the quad mask block and the cross point on the mask of the optical axis, defined by the optical centers of the sensor and lens blocks. The readout values in the A-orientation are thus X\({}_{\mathrm{A}}\) = X\({}_{\mathrm{cen}}\) + X\({}_{\mathrm{off}}\), and Y\({}_{\mathrm{A}}\) = Y\({}_{\mathrm{cen}}\) + Y\({}_{\mathrm{off}}\). Combining the readout values of orientations A, B, C and D gives:\[X_{\rm cen}=\nu_{2}\left(X_{\rm A}+X_{\rm C}\right)=\nu_{2}\left(Y_{\rm B}+Y_{\rm D}\right)\mbox{, and}\]

\[Y_{\rm cen}=\nu_{2}\left(Y_{\rm A}+Y_{\rm C}\right)=\nu_{2}\left(X_{\rm B}+X_{ \rm D}\right)\]

So, the relevant calibration values are measured twice; this is no surprise since the central point is defined twice; once by the four planes of the quad block, and once by its four holes.

The measured values for \(X_{\rm cen}\) and \(Y_{\rm cen}\) are listed in table 1.

**Conclusions**

_The differences between the sets of data from the (A,C)  and (B,D) orientations suggest that the mechanical precision of the mask quad block is much better than 10 \(\mu\)m._

_The mechanical stability, in terms of beam sag and hysteresis, of the calibration station is measured to be better than 2 \(\mu\)m during the period of the collection of the (A,B,C,D) data (3 minutes)._

_The mechanical stability of a calibration block, including a mask and its fixation, is measured to be better than 2 \(\mu\)m._

_The position of the quad mask block (by three steel spheres and one central aluminium-oxide sphere) on its support is defined within 2 \(\mu\)m._

### The rotation around the Z axis of the mask

The planes, defined by the three steel balls, on each of the three block support platforms are put horizontal within 50 \(\mu\)rad from vertical by means of a bubble level. The level is placed on a quad block which is rotated around its vertical axis. If the bubble does not change its position (related to the level bar) then the plane of rotation is horizontal. The vertical direction is then defined as the X coordinate of the

Projective Coordinate System (PCS; see section 1.4).

The masks are glued on the mask blocks, and their vertical contours will not exactly line up with the PCS X coordinate. This causes an error in the measured X and Y values, since the RCS is defined by the mask. We need therefore to measure this rotation for all the mask blocks, including the quad mask block.

We measured rotZ of the quad mask block by shifting it over a granite table, while taking RASNIK images from it with a sensor and lens fixed on the same granite table (see fig 11). The data and results are shown in fig 12.

### The RASNIK response for the quad lens block.

After mounting a lens with one of the four different focal lengths (as applied in H8), the Z position of the optical center was measured by rotating the block 180 deg around the X axis. Then the spacers were adjusted (see 2.3) until the Z value of the optical center with respect to the X axis of rotation was smaller than 0.1 mm.

In fig 13, the quad lens block is depicted in its four positions.

Suppose that the RASNIK readings are \(X_{\rm t}\) and \(Y_{\rm t}\) for the case that the optical center of the lens would be perfectly centered. For the non-perfect situation we can derive:\(X_{t}=\nu_{2}\) (\(X_{A}+X_{C}\)) = \(\nu_{2}\) (\(X_{B}+X_{D}\)), and

\(Y_{t}=\nu_{2}\) (\(Y_{A}+Y_{C}\)) = \(\nu_{2}\) (\(Y_{B}+Y_{D}\))

The position of the optical center of the quad lens block can be written as:

\(dX=C_{s}\) (\(X_{A}-X_{t}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(X_{t}\) - \(X_{C}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(Y_{B}-Y_{t}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(Y_{t}-Y_{D}\)), and

\(dY=C_{s}\) (\(Y_{A}\) - \(Y_{t}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(Y_{t}-Y_{C}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(X_{t}-X_{B}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(X_{D}-X_{t}\))

where \(C_{s}=S/(S+1)\), in which S is the image scale.

If we rotate the quad lens block, in orientation A, 180 deg around the vertical (X) axis, then we call the new orientation C'. Similar orientations:

\(A\)\(C\)'

\(B\)\(D\)'

\(C\)\(A\)'

\(D\)\(B\)'

Therefore:

\(X_{p}=\nu_{2}\) (\(X_{A^{\cdot}}+X_{C^{\cdot}}\)) = \(\nu_{2}\) (\(X_{B^{\cdot}}+X_{D^{\cdot}}\)),

\(Y_{p}=\nu_{2}\) (\(Y_{A^{\cdot}}+Y_{C^{\cdot}}\)) = \(\nu_{2}\) (\(Y_{B^{\cdot}}+Y_{D^{\cdot}}\)),

\(dX=C_{s}\) (\(X_{C^{\cdot}}-X_{t}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(X_{t}-X_{A^{\cdot}}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(Y_{t}-Y_{D^{\cdot}}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(Y_{B^{\cdot}}-Y_{t}\)),

\(dY=C_{s}\) (\(Y_{t}-Y_{C^{\cdot}}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(Y_{A^{\cdot}}-Y_{t}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(X_{t}-X_{D^{\cdot}}\)) = \(C_{s}\) (\(X_{B^{\cdot}}-X_{t}\))

Results are given in table 2.

The difference between the values associated with the (A,B,C,D) and (A',B',C',D') orientations can be well explained by the rotation of the mask in the quad mask block (rotZ = +0.0075 rad). The conversion of dX and dY from the Calibration Coordinate System (CCS) into the Projective Coordinate System (PCS) is as follows:

\(dX_{PCS}=dX_{CCS}\) * cos(rotZquad-mask) - \(dY_{CCS}\) * sin(rotZquad-mask) \(dY_{PCS}=dY_{CCS}\) * cos(rotZquad-mask) + \(dX_{CCS}\) * sin(rotZquad-mask)

In the bottom of table 3 the calibration values in the PCS are given. They agree within a single \(\mu\)m.

For H8, four sets of lenses with different focal length were applied. Since there was only one quad lens block available, we had to remove the lens after finishing the calibration of that particular lens set. Since the spread in the values for \(X_{t}\), \(Y_{t}\), dX and dY were always as small as in table 2 and 3, we did not repeat the calibration, as we did for the (first) lens LB 1. We repeated, however, the mounting of each of the four lens types, followed by a (single) calibration.

**Conclusions.**

_The conclusions of section 2 are confirmed._

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:8]

The calibration of each of the mask, lens or sensor block is done by comparing the RASNIK readout of the quad blocks in AAA position with the readout after exchanging one of the quad components with the block to be calibrated (XAA, AXA, AAX for a mask block, lens block and sensor block, respectively).

### The Mask Blocks

First, rotZ of each of the eight H8 **mask blocks** was measured by means of the 'optical axis swap' method. For this, a tool was made consisting of a lens block with the lens placed off-center (see fig 15). By rotating this block 180 deg around the vertical (X) axis, the optical axis is displaced from one end of the mask to the opposite end. This maximum 'range sweep' is providing the best possible precision, which is required for a uniform precision over the complete range of the projective alignment systems (mask dimensions 50 x 50 mm\({}^{2}\)). Essential for this measurement is the precise parallelism, thus verticality of the X axis of the mask and lens block supports.

The results are shown in table 5.

For the actual measurement of X\({}_{\text{cen}}\) and Y\({}_{\text{cen}}\), 5 measurements were done, with different rotX in steps of 0.05 rad (see table 6). After plotting the measured Y coordinate versus rotX, the fitted parabola gives an accurate value for the Y value at rotX = 0 (Par0), which is used as input for the calculation of Ycen. The distance (in Z) between the mask and the vertical axis of rotation of the mask block equals -Par1, and is always smaller than 0.13 mm.

The measured RASNIK X value varies little with rotX, as expected. The average is taken as input for the calculation of Xcen of a mask block:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{dX (CCS)}=\text{X}_{\text{cen-quad}}\text{ - X}_{\text{AAA}}\\ \text{dY (CCS)}=\text{Y}_{\text{cen-quad}}\text{ - Y}_{\text{AAA}}\end{array}\]

where X\({}_{\text{AAA}}\) equals the X reading of the three quad blocks on the calibration station (shortly before and after the calibration procedure); X\({}_{\text{quad-cen}}\) equals the X coordinate of the center of the quad mask block. Then we rotate the system:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{dX (RCS)}=\text{dX (CCS) * cos $\beta$ \leavevmode\nobreak\ $+ $ dY (CCS) * sin $\beta$, and}\\ \text{dY (RCS)}=\text{dY (CCS) * cos $\beta$ \leavevmode\nobreak\ $- $ dX (CCS) * sin $\beta$}\end{array}\]

where \(\beta\) = rotZ\({}_{\text{msk}}\) - rotZ\({}_{\text{cal}}\) in which the two terms are the rotations around the Z axis of the piece under calibration, and the quad mask calibration block, respectively.

Then:

\[\begin{array}{l}\text{X}_{\text{cen}}=\text{X}_{\text{read }}\text{ +dX (RCS), and}\\ \text{Y}_{\text{cen}}=\text{Y}_{\text{read }}\text{ +dY (RCS)}\end{array}\]

where X\({}_{\text{read}}\) and Y\({}_{\text{read}}\) are the RASNIK reading of the system with the mask block under calibration (XAA).

The results of four series of measurements of the H8 mask blocks are given in table 7. Since an H8 mask block weights less than the quad mask block, the sag of the station will change after the exchange of the two. We first corrected for this by measuring the station sag as a function of the applied weight (measurements of 28 and 29 January). Since the positions of the mask and sensor blocks is different for a variety of lens focal lengths, we compensated the weight difference by adding a mass instead. The values taken on Feb. 11 and 13 are therefore more reliable. These values agree within 3 \(\mu\)m.

### The calibration of the H8 lens blocks

As for the H8 mask blocks, the H8 lens blocks were calibrated by comparing the RASNIK readout from the three calibration blocks (AAA) with the readout from a system with exchanged lens block (AXA). Additionally, the readout was recorded with the H8 lens rotated by 180 deg around the vertical (X) axis (AX'A).

The results for the H8 lens blocks type LB 1 are shown in table 8.

Here,

\begin{tabular}{l} \(\mathrm{dX}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) = \(\mathrm{dX_{quad-len}}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) + (\(\mathrm{X_{AXA}-X_{AAA}}\)) \(\mathrm{S}\) / (\(\mathrm{S}\)+1) and \\ \(\mathrm{dY}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) = \(\mathrm{dY_{quad-len}}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) + (\(\mathrm{Y_{AXA}-Y_{AAA}}\)) \(\mathrm{S}\) / (\(\mathrm{S}\)+1) \\ \end{tabular}

Rotation around \(\mathrm{rotZ_{quad-mask}}\) gives:

\begin{tabular}{l} \(\mathrm{dX}\) (\(\mathrm{PCS}\)) = \(\mathrm{dX}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) * \(\cos(\mathrm{rotZ_{quad-mask}})\) - \(\mathrm{dY}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) \(\sin(\mathrm{rotZ_{quad-mask}})\) \\ \(\mathrm{dY}\) (\(\mathrm{PCS}\)) = \(\mathrm{dY}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) * \(\cos(\mathrm{rotZ_{quad-mask}})\) + \(\mathrm{dX}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) \(\sin(\mathrm{rotZ_{quad-mask}})\) \\ \end{tabular}

All H8 lens blocks were calibrated twice; in all cases (besides LB2-H8), a lens was re-mounted into the quad lens block (see table 9).

During the calibration, the weight difference between the lens block and the quad lens block would have caused an image shift of some 12 \(\mu\)m. This was precisely compensated by means of an additional weight during the 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) calibration series. The discrepancies in dX (PCS) (vertical sag direction), up to 7 \(\mu\)m, are well explained by non-perfect weight compensation; the values of the 2\({}^{\mathrm{nd}}\) series are therefore taken.

### The calibration of the H8 sensor blocks

Like the sensor- and lens blocks, the calibration of the sensor blocks is done by comparing them to the quad sensor block. This is shown in tables 10a and 10 b, where: the following expressions are used:

\begin{tabular}{l} \(\mathrm{dX}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) = \(\mathrm{dX_{cal}}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) + \(\mathrm{S}\) (\(\mathrm{X_{AAA}-X_{meas}}\)), and \\ \(\mathrm{dY}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) = \(\mathrm{dY_{cal}}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) + \(\mathrm{S}\) (\(\mathrm{Y_{AAA}-X_{meas}}\)) \\ \end{tabular}

where S equald the image scale. Conversion from CCS to PCS gives:

\begin{tabular}{l} \(\mathrm{dX}\) (\(\mathrm{PCS}\)) = \(\mathrm{dX}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) * \(\cos\) (\(\mathrm{rotZ_{cal}}\)) - \(\mathrm{dY}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) * \(\sin\) (\(\mathrm{rotZ_{cal}}\)), and \\ \(\mathrm{dY}\) (\(\mathrm{PCS}\)) = \(\mathrm{dY}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) * \(\cos\) (\(\mathrm{rotZ_{cal}}\)) + \(\mathrm{dX}\) (\(\mathrm{CCS}\)) * \(\sin\) (\(\mathrm{rotZ_{cal}}\)) \\ \end{tabular}

The rotation around the Z-axis of the sensor follows from the image rotation:

\begin{tabular}{l} \(\mathrm{rotZ_{sensor}}\) = \(\mathrm{rotZ_{cal}}\) - \(\mathrm{rotZ_{ima}}\) \\ \end{tabular}

The left section of table 11 has the origin of the image in the top left corner (OOC = 0); in the right section this origin is situated in the center of the image (OOC = 1).

The effects of the different settings for OOC = 0 and OOC = 1 are shown in the right-hand table 11, where the distance between the two origins is computed:

\[\mathrm{dist}=\mathrm{sqrt}(\mathrm{\ d}\mathrm{X}^{2}+\mathrm{d}\mathrm{Y}^{2})\]

Note that these distances agree within +/- 2.5 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\). From previous scale measurements (S = 1.0001, with mask fixed against the sensor and the light source placed far away) we know that our RasCams have pixel pitches of 12.000 x 12.000 \(\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\). A RasCam image has 396 x 292 pixels. Half the diagonal equals therefore:

\[\mathrm{D_{h}}=0.5\ \mathrm{x}\ 0.012\ \mathrm{x}\ \mathrm{sqrt}\ (396^{2}+292^{2})=2952.09 \ \mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\]

in good agreement with the values found in table 11.

The ratio \(\mathrm{d}\mathrm{Y}/\mathrm{d}\mathrm{X}\) is a function of rotZ of the sensor. In fig 16, rotZ, measured from the images, is plotted versus rotZ from \(\mathrm{d}\mathrm{Y}/\mathrm{d}\mathrm{X}\). The straight line and its slope confirms the expected relation between the OOC = 0 and OOC = 1 data.

**Conclusion.**_The effects of selection the origin of an image in the top-left corner or in the center of an image is well understood and has therefore no effect on the performance of a RASNIK system. For the same reason ATLAS/Muon should only use one of the two options._

## 5 Triplet verification of the quad blocks & H8 blocks;

station alignment and calibration values summary

### Triplet verification and Station Alignment

When the three quad blocks are placed on the calibration station, the alignment of the station follows from the RASNIK readout and the calibration values of the three blocks.

In a final test, we swapped the quad mask block and quad sensor block, and we rotated the quad lens block around its vertical (X) axis by 180 deg. In table 14, the alignment data is presented. The columns represent:

- date;

- system name or identification;

- mask calibration constants (Xcen,Ycen,rotZ);

- lens calibration constants dX and dY (in PCS);

- sensor calibration constants dX, dY and rotZ (in PCS). Note that these values are different for OOC = 0 and OOC = 1;

- the position of the cross point of the optical axis (defined by the optical centers of the lens and the 'origin on CCD') and the mask plane. The values \(\mathrm{d}\mathrm{X}_{\mathrm{ideal}}\) and \(\mathrm{d}\mathrm{Y}_{\mathrm{ideal}}\) are the distances, respectively between the cross point and the center of the mask (the values would be the RASNIK readings if the origin of 

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:12]

The largest discrepancy (8 \(\upmu\)m in dX) is probably due to a non-perfect weight compensation. These systems were re-measured on March 10, where the agreement was with +/- 3 \(\upmu\)m.

On February 27, the three quad blocks (at that time the quad lens block was equipped with a lens of type LB1-H8) were put on the alignment station and commonly rotated by 90 deg. Around the Z axis (positions AAA, BBB, CCC and DDD). The dX and dY parameters of the quad blocks were swapped accordingly, and the measured station sag values were equal within +/- 3 \(\upmu\)m. This is true for almost all triplet verifications.

**Conclusion**

_The calibration of all quad blocks and all H8 blocks was verified on the calibration station. The found alignment parameters mutually agreed within +/- 3 \(\upmu\)m._

### Systematical and random errors

From previous measurements we know that the intrinsic precision, per image, of a RASNIK system, with a distance between sensor and mask smaller than 100 mm, is in the order of 0.3 \(\upmu\)m, 0.3 \(\upmu\)m, 20 x 10-6 and 20 \(\upmu\)rad for the X coordinate, Y coordinate, the image scale and \(\mathrm{rotZ}_{\mathrm{ima}}\), respectively.

For a distance of about 5 m between sensor and mask, the fluctuations and gradients in the air density cause an increase in the random error: the values are 1 \(\upmu\)m, 1 \(\upmu\)m, 200 x 10-4 and 150 \(\upmu\)rad, respectively. For some of our measurements, these fluctuations were too large, and the average of 4 - 8 measurements was taken. Our results are consistent with these fluctations and the mechanical uncertainties.

By means of three fans, the air was mixed in order to reduce the systematic error. By this, we reduce the first-order systematic error, due to a gradient in the air temperature. This appears as a sag in the station, and it is hard to find a way to distinguish between a real mechanical sag and this 'gradient' sag.

In an attempt to measure the effect of the temperature gradient, we operated the fans periodically (1 h on, 1 h off). The effect on the vertical RASNIK coordinate is obvious (fig 17), but almost the same effect is seen in the RASNIK monitors mounted at the sides of the station bar. It is unlikely that the same gradient is present there, and an identical change in gradient is even more unlikely. We conclude that we mainly change the vertical temperature gradient in the bar when we operate the fans.

The difference in a change between the RASNIK on top of the bar, and the two systems at the bar sides is maximal 10 \(\upmu\)m. A larger part of this is due to the difference in length of the systems, and the fact that the bar deformation may have 2nd and 3rd order terms.

**Conclusion**

_The systematical error due to a vertical gradient in the air temperature is hard to estimate, since reducing this gradient reduces the gradient of the alignment bar as well. From the differences between the RASNIK systems fixed at both sides of the bar and the system on top of the bar we estimate the systematical error much smaller than 10 \(\upmu\)m._
In table 13 the final calibration values of the H8 blocks are given. For this, all measurements are used. Weights were applied to compensate for known discrepancies due to non-perfect sag compensation.

The following relation hold for any combination of RASNIK blocks:

rotZ\({}_{\text{ima}}\)'should be equal to' (rotZ\({}_{\text{mask}}\) - rotZ\({}_{\text{sensor}}\))

A significant deviation from this value suggests that the supports of either the mask block or the sensor block are not parallel. Since RASNIK data is only sensitive for the differential rotZ of the mask and sensor blocks, one does not know the angular position of the blocks. This causes an uncertainty in the X and Y values of the alignment data which is proportional to the alignment deviation itself.

For converting (raw) RASNIK data (X\({}_{\text{read}}\), Y\({}_{\text{read}}\), S and rotZ\({}_{\text{mask}}\)) into alignment data, in terms of mask displacement (in PCS) the following steps should be applied:

dX\({}_{\text{ideal}}=\)dX\({}_{\text{LEN}}\)(1+1/S) - dX\({}_{\text{SEN}}\)/S and

dY\({}_{\text{ideal}}=\)dY\({}_{\text{LEN}}\)(1+1/S) - dY\({}_{\text{SEN}}\)/S

where dX\({}_{\text{LEN}}\), dX\({}_{\text{SEN}}\), dY\({}_{\text{LEN}}\) and dY\({}_{\text{SEN}}\) (in PCS) are to be found in tables 12 and 13.

dX\({}_{\text{RCS}}=\) X\({}_{\text{meas}}\) - dX\({}_{\text{ideal}}\) - X\({}_{\text{cen}}\), and

dY\({}_{\text{RCS}}=\) Y\({}_{\text{meas}}\) - dY\({}_{\text{ideal}}\) - Y\({}_{\text{cen}}\)

where X\({}_{\text{cen}}\) and Y\({}_{\text{cen}}\) are the mask offsets, also given in tables 12 and 13.

Then the alignment in PCS follows from:

dX\({}_{\text{PCS}}=\) dX\({}_{\text{RCS}}\) x cos(rotZ\({}_{\text{mask}}\)) - dY\({}_{\text{RCS}}\) x sin(rotZ\({}_{\text{mask}}\)), and

dY\({}_{\text{PCS}}=\) dY\({}_{\text{RCS}}\) x cos(rotZ\({}_{\text{mask}}\)) + dX\({}_{\text{RCS}}\) x sin(rotZ\({}_{\text{mask}}\)).

## 6 Conclusions

_We have calibrated the Projective Alignment RASNIK block prototypes, used in H8. The results of the calibration procedure are in agreement with the expectations based on the intrinsic RASNIK performance. We can not directly measure the effect of a vertical gradient in the air; the difference between two RASNIK systems, when operation air mixing, sets a maximum value for the air gradient effect as 10 \(\mu\)m image displacement. When operating the air mixing continuously, we believe that this gradient effect is smaller than 2 \(\mu\)m. The combined error in a triplet, composed of any mask- lens- or sensor block, is smaller than 4 \(\mu\)m in terms of lens displacement (track sagitta). This is almost a factor 4 better than required._* [1] Publication in progress.

_Table 4. Calibration values of the quad sensor block. The measurements of Feb 13 were converted into the PCS values._Table 5: Data from each of the 8 pcs H8 mask blocks. The special lens block with its lens placed off-center (in the Y direction) was rotated three times, providing two pairs sets of (X,Y) data points. Within a pair (with two rotations in between), the differences in X and Y are within 2 \(\mu\)m. A straight line is fitted through the data points, and its slope is a measure for the mask rotation rotZ. The same rotation follows from the image rotation (last column) apart from an offset due to the rotation of the sensor. The two measured rotations agree within the expected (statistical) error.
