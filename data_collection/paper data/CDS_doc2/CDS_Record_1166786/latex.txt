###### Abstract

This paper describes a study on the measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry in \(pp\to Z/\gamma^{*}X\to e^{+}e^{-}X\) events with the ATLAS detector for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). Such a measurement can be used to determine the effective weak mixing angle, \(\sin^{2}\theta_{eff}^{lept}\). We will demonstrate that a very high accuracy on the weak mixing angle, \(\delta\sin^{2}\theta_{eff}^{lept}=(1.5(\mathrm{stat})\pm 0.3(\mathrm{exp})\pm 2.4(\mathrm{PDF}))\times 10^{-4}\), can be reached. This is possible due to the large cross-section for the production of \(Z\) bosons at the LHC and by using electron reconstruction in the forward calorimeters of ATLAS (\(2.5<|\eta|<4.9\)).

_Keywords_: LHC, ATLAS, Z\(\rightarrow\)e+e-, Forward-Backward Asymmetry, \(\sin^{2}\theta_{eff}^{lept}\).

Introduction

The forward-backward asymmetry, \(A_{FB}\), measurement is one of the important precision measurements that can be done at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). It will improve the knowledge of Standard Model parameters and test the existence of physics beyond the Standard Model.

The \(Z\) boson events in \(pp\) collisions originate from the annihilation of valence quarks with sea antiquarks or from the annihilation of sea quarks with sea antiquarks. Since the valence quarks carry on average a larger momentum fraction than the sea quarks, the boost direction of the dilepton system can indicate the quark direction. However, dilepton events which originate from the annihilation of sea quarks with sea antiquarks do not contribute to the observed asymmetry.

\(A_{FB}\) measurements with quarks and leptons at the \(Z\) peak provide a precise determination of the weak mixing angle \(\sin^{2}\theta_{eff}^{\nu_{\mu\tau}}\). The weak mixing angle is an important parameter in the electroweak theory that describes the mixing between weak and electromagnetic interactions. In the global fit of the Standard Model, the weak mixing angle has an impact on indirect constraints on Higgs mass.

With the experimental capabilities of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC and an expected integrated luminosity of up to 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) it becomes interesting to perform a study on the measurement of the asymmetry, \(A_{FB}\). In order to improve the measurement precision, it will be necessary to detect leptons in the very forward pseudo-rapidity region, which favors electrons over muons at ATLAS. In 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) data around 1.5\(\times 10^{8}\)\(Z\) events will be produced, of which \(\sim\)5\(\times 10^{6}\) decay to an electron-positron pair, providing the measurement of \(A_{FB}\) (and \(\sin^{2}\theta_{eff}^{\nu_{\mu\tau}}\)) with a competitive precision to the current world average value [1], \(\delta\sin^{2}\theta_{eff}^{\nu_{\mu\tau}}\)=0.00016.

This paper is organized as follows. In section 2 we present a short introduction of the theoretical aspects of the measurement. An overview of the ATLAS detector is given in section 3. In section 4 the electron measurement in ATLAS is presented, both in the central and forward regions the latter being necessary for a precise measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry. We then present the simulated data samples used in section 5 and the definition of the electron polar angle in section 6. The event selection cuts are discussed in section 7. The charge misidentification is given in section 8. The pile-up effect is discussed in section 9. The systematic uncertainties are summarized in section 10. The expected precision on the asymmetry around the \(Z\) mass is shown in section 11.

## 2 Forward-backward asymmetry

In proton-proton collisions, \(e^{+}e^{-}\) pairs are predominantly produced via the annihilation of a quark \(q\) and an antiquark \(\bar{q}\). In the Standard Model, quark-antiquark annihilations proceed via an intermediate [2, 3]\(\gamma^{*}\) at low invariant mass \(M_{(e^{+}e^{-})}\) or via a \(\gamma^{*}/Z\) interference at \(M_{(e^{+}e^{-})}\) around the \(Z\) mass. The electroweak neutral current in the Standard Model lagrangian violates parity (due to the presence of vector and axial-vector couplings of the quarks and leptons to the \(Z\)-boson) and leads to an asymmetry in the polar emission angle of the electron in the rest frame of the electron-positron pair. The asymmetry can only be extracted with respect to the boost direction of the di-electron system since the quark direction is not known (see Sec. 6).

The differential cross-section for the production of an electron-positron pair in \(q\bar{q}\) annihilation via the \(s\)-channel can be written, in the electron-positron rest frame [4, 5], as:\[\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta}=N_{c}[(1+\cos^{2}\theta)F_{0}(s)+2\cos\theta F_{1}(s)] \tag{1}\]

where \(\theta\) is the emission angle of the \(e^{-}\) relative to the momentum vector of the quark in the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) rest frame and s is the center-of-mass energy squared. \(F_{0}(s)\), \(F_{1}(s)\) are form factors and \(N_{c}\) (1/3) is the colour factor:

\[F_{0}(s) = \frac{\pi\alpha^{2}}{2s}(q_{q}^{2}q_{l}^{2}+2Re\chi(s)q_{q}q_{l}C _{V}^{q}C_{V}^{l}+|\chi(s)|^{2}((C_{V}^{q})^{2}+(C_{A}^{q})^{2})((C_{V}^{l})^{2 }+(C_{A}^{l})^{2})) \tag{2}\] \[F_{1}(s) = \frac{\pi\alpha^{2}}{2s}(2Re\chi(s)q_{q}q_{l}C_{A}^{q}C_{A}^{l}+| \chi(s)|^{2}2C_{V}^{q}C_{V}^{l}2C_{A}^{q}C_{A}^{l}), \tag{3}\]

with

\[\chi(s)=\frac{s}{s-M_{Z}^{2}+is\Gamma_{Z}/M_{Z}} \tag{4}\]

where \(q_{q,l}\) is the electric charge of the quark or lepton and \(C_{V}\), \(C_{A}\) are the vector and axial-vector coupling to the \(Z\).

The angular dependence of the various terms is either \(\cos\theta\) or (1+\(\cos^{2}\theta\)). Only the \((1+\cos^{2}\theta)\) term contributes to the total cross-section, as the \(\cos\theta\) term integrates to zero. However, it induces a forward-backward asymmetry. Thus, the differential cross-section can be written in a simple expression:

\[\frac{1}{\sigma}\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta}=[\frac{3}{8}(1+\cos^{2}\theta)+A_ {FB}(s)\cos\theta] \tag{5}\]

where \(\sigma=\frac{8}{3}F_{0}(s)\times N_{c}\) and

\[A_{FB}(s) = \frac{1}{\sigma}[\sigma(\cos\theta>0)-\sigma(\cos\theta<0)] \tag{6}\] \[= \frac{3}{4}\frac{F_{1}(s)}{F_{0}(s)}\] (7) \[A_{FB}(s=M_{Z}^{2}) \sim \frac{3}{4}\frac{2C_{V}^{q}C_{A}^{q}}{(C_{V}^{q})^{2}+(C_{A}^{q} )^{2}}\frac{2C_{V}^{l}C_{A}^{l}}{(C_{V}^{l})^{2}+(C_{A}^{l})^{2}} \tag{8}\]

The forward-backward asymmetry is commonly defined using the number of forward produced (\(\cos\theta>0\)) events (\(N_{F}\)) and backward-produced (\(\cos\theta<0\)) events (\(N_{B}\))

\[A_{FB}=\frac{N_{F}-N_{B}}{N_{F}+N_{B}} \tag{9}\]

where

\[F=\int_{0}^{1}\frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta}d\cos\theta,\quad B=\int_{-1}^{0} \frac{d\sigma}{d\cos\theta}d\cos\theta \tag{10}\]

### Dependence of A\({}_{FB}\) on M\({}_{e^{+}e^{-}}\)

In Figure 1 we show the Standard Model prediction, using MRST PDF [6], of the forward-backward charge asymmetry as function of the di-electron invariant mass. At the \(Z\)-pole we see a small asymmetry (as expected) which is dominated by a small vector coupling in \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) with the dominant axial coupling. Around the \(Z\) mass the asymmetry is linear with the weak mixing angle \(\sin^{2}\theta_{eff}^{lept}\). It was estimated that (in a good approximation) the weak mixing angle can be determined from the measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry (this is the raw forward backward asymmetry measured at detector level) when averaged over the rapidity of the electron pair as follow [7, 8, 9]:

\[A_{FB}=b(a-\sin^{2}\theta_{eff}^{lept}) \tag{11}\]

the parameters \(a\) and \(b\) depend on the parton distribution functions (PDFs).

At large invariant mass, \(A_{FB}\) is dominated by the properties of the interference between the propagators of the \(\gamma^{e}\) and the \(Z\) and is almost constant at a large positive value, close to 0.6, independent of the invariant mass.

## 3 Detector overview

The ATLAS detector has been described in detail in [10]. It consists of an inner tracking system, with pseudo-rapidity coverage of \(|\eta|<\) 2.5, inside a 2 T solenoidal magnetic field, followed by the calorimeters, and an outer muon spectrometer, with pseudo-rapidity coverage of \(|\eta|<\) 2.7, installed in a large toroidal magnet system. We briefly describe the parts of the detector relevant to this analysis.

Figure 2 shows a schematic transversal view of the ATLAS calorimeter system. It has been designed to be hermetic to \(|\eta|<\) 4.9 with a fine lateral and longitudinal segmentation. A liquid argon (LAr) sampling calorimeter in a barrel-endcap geometry provides the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry. At \(|\eta|<\)1.2 the hadronic calorimetry is completed by a tile (Iron/scintillator) hadronic calorimeter.

The electromagnetic barrel calorimeter, covering a pseudo-rapidity range of \(|\eta|<\) 1.475, shares its cryostat with the superconducting solenoid, the calorimeter being behind the solenoid. Each electromagnetic calorimeter end-cap (EMEC) covers the pseudo-rapidity range 1.4-3.2. To correct for the energy lost in the material in front of the calorimeters, both end-caps and barrel are preceded with pre-sampler detectors in the region \(|\eta|<\) 1.8. The performance expected gives for the energy resolution a sampling term of \(10\%/\sqrt{E({\rm GeV})}\) and a constant term better than 0.7%. The hadronic end-cap calorimeter (HEC) and the forward calorimeter (FCal) share the same cryostat with the EMEC and cover the pseudo-rapidity range 1.5-3.2 and 3.1-4.9 respectively. The design of the FCal was constrained by the high radiation level in the very forward region. It consists of three consecutive modules along the beam line: one electromagnetic module (FCal1) and two hadronic modules (FCal2 and FCal3). To optimize the resolution,

copper was chosen as the absorber for FCal1, while tungsten was used in FCal2 and FCal3, to provide containment and minimize the lateral spread of hadronic showers.

The electron energy can be measured either in the central electromagnetic calorimeter (\(|\eta|<\)2.5) and/or in the forward calorimeters (2.5 \(<|\eta|<\) 4.9). The \(|\eta|<\) 2.5 region corresponds to the EM barrel and the EMEC outer wheel.

## 4 Electron identification

### Central electrons

An electron candidate is reconstructed in the central calorimeters if there is a cluster with energy \(E\) and a charged track matched to the cluster with the condition of \(E/p<7\) and \(|\Delta\eta|<\) 0.05 and \(|\Delta\phi|<\) 0.1. \(\Delta\eta\) (\(\Delta\phi\)) is the difference between the \(\eta\) (\(\phi\)) position of the track and the position of the cluster. The track is then extrapolated to the cluster. The energy of the electron is determined by the total energy it deposits in the EM calorimeter. The transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) of the electron is determined by the energy measured in the calorimeter and by the track angle at the nominal interaction point. The charge of the electron (\(q_{e}\)) is determined from the sign of the curvature of the track.

The development of electromagnetic and hadronic showers is quite different so that shower shape information can be used to differentiate between electrons and hadrons. Electrons deposit almost all their energy in the electromagnetic section of the calorimeter, while hadrons are typically much more penetrating. To obtain the best discrimination against hadrons, we use both longitudinal and transverse shower shapes. For example, for electrons passing tight identification criteria, the hadronic leakage and the lateral shower shape in the first and second sampling of the calorimeter are used. After the selections based on calorimeter information, we also take into account the inner detector information. We ask for a good track pointing to the calorimeter and fulfilling the consistency of the spatial and energy matching between the calorimeter and the inner detector.

Figure 3 and Figure 4 show the electron identification efficiency, 62.0\(\pm\)1.0 % on average, as a function of the electron transverse momentum and pseudo-rapidity \(\eta\) using electrons (and positrons) from \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events (the samples used are described in section 5). Tight cuts have been applied to iden

tify the central electrons. We observe an expected increase in the efficiency as function of \(p_{T}\). This dependence (in particular at low \(p_{T}\)) is due to the lower performance for low \(p_{T}\) electrons. The drop in the efficiency versus \(\eta\) happens at the transition region between barrel and end-cap calorimeters, 1.37 \(<|\eta|<\)1.52. A more detailed description of the electron identification in the central calorimeters is given elsewhere [11].

### Forward electrons

In contrast to the central region, forward electron reconstruction can use only calorimeter information as the tracking system is limited to the central region (\(|\eta|<2.5\)). In this case we can not distinguish between an electron, positron or photon. The electron candidate in the forward calorimeter2) is reconstructed if there is a cluster with \(E_{T}>20\) GeV. The direction of the electron is defined by the barycenter of the cells belonging to the cluster in the calorimeter.

Footnote 2): the EM forward calorimeters are the EMEC inner wheel (\(2.5<|\eta|<3.2\)) and the front compartment of the FCal. These EM calorimeters are completed by the HEC and the last 2 compartments of the FCal (\(3.2<|\eta|<4.9\)).

To discriminate between electron and hadron a multivariate analysis [12] is used. Variables are defined using cluster moments or a combination of them.

The cluster moment of degree \(n\) for a variable \(x\) is defined as:

\[\langle x^{n}\rangle=\frac{1}{E_{\rm norm}}\times\sum_{i}E_{i}x_{i}^{n}\,, \tag{12}\]

where \(E_{\rm norm}=\)\(\sum_{i}E_{i}\), \(E_{i}\) is the cell energy and \(i\) is the cell index of the cluster.

We use the following five discriminants in the electron ID:

* \(r_{i}=|\:(\vec{x}_{i}-\vec{c})\times\vec{u}\,|\): Electromagnetic and hadronic showers have different shapes in both the transverse and the longitudinal directions. To evaluate the shower shapes in the transverse direction we use the second moment of the distance \(r_{i}\) of each cell \(i\) (\(\vec{x}_{i}\)) to the shower axis (\(\vec{c}\)). \(\vec{u}\) is the shower axis.
* \(lat_{2}/(lat_{2}+lat_{max})\): A modified lateral moment is derived as above. It takes into account the two most energetic cells (shower core). So, \(lat_{2}\) is the second moment of the variable \(r_{i}\) for which we impose that the distance \(r=0\) for the two most energetic cells. For \(lat_{max}\) we impose that \(r=4\) cm for the two most energetic cells and \(r=0\) for the remaining cells.
* \(long_{2}/(long_{2}+long_{max})\): To evaluate the shower shapes in the longitudinal direction we use an equivalent variable to the previous one where the distance of the each cell to the shower centre is used.
* \(\frac{1}{E_{\mathrm{norm}}}\times\sum\limits_{i}E_{i}\) (\(E_{i}/V_{i}\)): where \(V_{i}\) is the volume of the cell \(i\). The electromagnetic shower is narrow and deposits energy more locally than a hadronic shower.
* \(f_{max}\) Fraction of the energy in the most energetic cell of the cluster. By measuring the energy fractions deposited in the cells of a segmented calorimeter it is usually possible to distinguish incident hadrons from electrons and photons.

In order to combine the electron identification information from the various discriminants into a single quantity that provides optimal discrimination power, we calculate the likelihood for each discriminant based on probability density functions. For each discriminant, the signal likelihood (\(p_{s}\)) and the background likelihood (\(p_{B}\)) are separately calculated and combined using the likelihood ratio:

\[R_{L}=\frac{\prod_{j=1}^{N_{\mathrm{var}}}p_{s}(j)}{\prod_{j=1}^{N_{\mathrm{var }}}p_{s}(j)+\prod_{j=1}^{N_{\mathrm{var}}}p_{B}(j)} \tag{13}\]

where \(j\) runs over each discriminant. Figure 5 shows the distribution of \(R_{L}\) using all the discriminants described above. Both electrons (signal) and background are shown. As can be seen, good separation is achieved with this variable. The electron identification efficiency determined using \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) events as function of the electron \(p_{T}\) and \(\eta\) as shown in Figures 6 and 7. The drop in the efficiency plot versus \(\eta\) happens at the transition region between inner wheel of the electromagnetic end-cap and the FCal.

Figure 5: The likelihood ratio \(R_{L}\) for the signal (yellow) and background (solid line). Due to the fact that the likelihood ratio is strongly peaked at 0 and 1, in the plot, a transformation is applied that zooms into the peaks.

## 5 Monte-Carlo samples

The Monte Carlo events are generated at a centre of mass of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV using PYTHIA [13] (version 6.3) for the signal \(pp\to Z/\gamma^{*}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) and the background \(pp\to jj\) with the CTEQ6LL [14] parton distribution functions. Table 1 shows the summary of the cross-sections, number of events and the equivalent luminosity for the signal and background simulated events.

### Signal

The \(pp\to Z/\gamma^{*}X\to e^{+}e^{-}X\) events generated are filtered requiring at least one electron with \(|\eta|<2.7\) and with transverse momentum \(p_{T}>10\) GeV and a dilepton mass, \(\hat{m}\), greater than 60 GeV. Figures 9 and 9 show the \(p_{T}\) distribution of electrons and the invariant mass of the electron pairs in the signal events.

### Background

The dominant sources of background to the signal process \(pp\to Z/\gamma^{*}X\to e^{+}e^{-}X\) are:* dijet production: this is the largest background when two jets fake an electron. The cross-section of this process is greater by several orders of magnitude than the signal one, and dominates at low transverse momentum.
* \(pp\to t\bar{t}X\to e^{+}e^{-}X\): The top quark decays into the \(W\) boson and a \(b\) quark, followed by the \(W\) decay into electron and neutrino (\(t\to Wb\), \(W\to e\nu\)). It has the same signature as the signal one as the two electrons of the final state can simulate the two electrons from \(Z\).
* \(pp\to W+X\to e\nu_{e}+X\): where \(X\) is a photon or a jet misidentified as an electron

These events are passed through a detector simulation program to model detector response. Two detector simulation tools are used: a full detector simulation tool, based on GEANT4 [15], and a fast simulation program, ATLFAST [16] which simulates the detector response using efficiencies and smearing parameters measured from detailed simulation data. ATLFAST was used due to the high di-jet cross-section, the high rejection power of the selections and the available Monte Carlo statistics of fully simulated events which is not sufficient to evaluate the background. The Monte Carlo samples processed with the fast detector simulation were used only for estimation of the background contributions.

Ref. [17] discusses expectation for electron triggers at different luminosities. The \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) events used in this measurement are selected by high transverse momentum triggers on one or two electrons. This selection requires at least one isolated electron with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}>20\) GeV or at least two isolated electrons with \(\mathrm{p}_{T}>12\) GeV. At Level 1, electrons are selected by the presence of an energy deposition in an EM calorimeter tower. The Level 2 decision, which is based on the result of the Level 1 trigger, can take into account the information from all ATLAS subdetector systems in the regions of interest (ROIs) and the event filter (EF) performs its task only after the complete event has been assembled in the event builder (EB).

## 6 Angular distribution

The \(Z\) production can be either from the annihilation of valence quarks with sea antiquarks or from the annihilation of sea quarks with sea antiquarks. Since the original quark direction is unknown in proton-proton collisions (it can originate with equal probability from either proton), the sign of \(\cos\theta\) is not directly measurable.

As the valence quarks have, on average, a much larger momentum than the sea quarks, in valence-sea quark collisions, the longitudinal motion of the dilepton system approximates the quark direction and the angle between the lepton and the quark in the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) rest frame can be extracted with respect to the beam axis. A lepton asymmetry can thus be expected with respect to the boost direction. For sea-sea quark collisions no such asymmetry is expected, diluting the overall effect.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l l} \hline \hline Physics process & Cross section (nb) & \(\epsilon_{filter}\) & Number of events & Equivalent luminosity (\(\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\)) \\ \hline \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\) & 2.015 & 0.126 & \(5.10^{5}\) & 248.14 \\ Inclusive jets & \(21.10^{4}\) & 0.09 & \(3.10^{7}\) & 0.15 \\ \(t\bar{t}\) & 0.833 & & \(6.10^{5}\) & 720.3 \\ \(W+X\) & 38.2 & & \(1.10^{6}\) & 26.2 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: List of signal and background samples.

To minimize the effect of the unknown transverse momenta of the incoming quarks in the measurement of the forward and backward cross-sections, we use the Collins-Soper reference frame [18]. This reference frame reduces the uncertainty in electron polar angle due to the finite transverse momentum of the incoming quarks. The particle four-vectors are transformed to the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) rest frame and the polar angle \(\theta^{*}\) is measured with respect to the axis, which bisects the two quark momentum vectors.

\[\cos\theta^{*}=\frac{2}{m(e^{+}e^{-})\sqrt{m^{2}(e^{+}e^{-})+p_{T}^{2}(e^{+}e^ {-})}}[p^{+}(e^{-})p^{-}(e^{+})-p^{+}(e^{+})p^{-}(e^{-})] \tag{14}\]

where \(p^{\pm}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(E\pm p_{z})\), \(E\) is the energy and \(p_{z}\) is the longitudinal component of the momentum. To take into account our supposition that the \(Z\) boost and the quark direction are the same we add the sign of the \(Z\) boost to the definition:

\[\cos\theta^{*}=\frac{|p_{z}(e^{+}e^{-})|}{p_{z}(e^{+}e^{-})}\times\cos\theta^ {*} \tag{15}\]

Figure 10 shows the resulting distributions of events for which th \(e^{+}e^{-}\) invariant mass is close to the \(Z\) mass. We should note that the detector itself doesn't introduce false asymmetries with the geometry used in the MC samples.

## 7 Analysis method

### Event selection

In this analysis we search for events with two electrons. An electron must fulfill certain quality and kinematic requirements. It must first satisfy the tight electron criteria outlined in Section 4.1. In addition the following cuts were applied:

* **C1** We require an electron transverse momentum higher than 20 GeV (\(p_{T}>20\) GeV) to emulate the energy threshold of the electron trigger
* **C2** We require the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) invariant mass, M\({}_{(e^{+}e^{-})}\), to be within a window of 12 GeV around the \(Z\) mass, 85.2 GeV \(<\) M\({}_{(e^{+}e^{-})}\)\(<\) 97.2 GeV (\(Z\) pole)

Figure 10: Distribution in \(\cos\theta^{*}\) for reconstructed events in the \(Z\) pole region.

* **C3**\(|y_{e^{+}e^{-}}|>1\) In contrast to Tevatron \(p\bar{p}\) collisions, sea quark effects dominate at the LHC. At central rapidity, \(y_{e^{+}e^{-}}\), the probability that the valence quark direction and the dielectron boost coincide is lower due the smallness of the valence quark distribution. This reduces the forward backward asymmetry. Since the valence quark dominates at high values of \(x\), the events where one parton carries a large fraction of the proton momentum are more sensitive and they give a large rapidity to the dilepton system. In this region the most significant measurements can be performed, as shown in Figure 11. A purer, though smaller, signal sample can thus be obtained by introducing a rapidity cut. For the following studies we will impose a \(|y_{e^{+}e^{-}}|>1\) cut.
* **C4**\(E_{t}^{miss}<20\) GeV We require the missing transverse momentum to be less than 20 GeV. This cut rejects efficiently the background coming from \(pp\to t\bar{t}X\) channel where both top quarks decay semileptonically.

### Analysis cases

A study using fast simulated events [19] showed that the use of forward electrons improves the precision of the forward-backward asymmetry measurement (and the weak mixing angle). As can be seen in Figure 12, a very high electron identification performance in the forward calorimeters is not needed, as already with a rejection of 100 against jets the influence of the remaining QCD background is negligible. Figure 12 shows only the statistical uncertainty on \(A_{FB}\) versus the jet rejection in the forward calorimeters (with a fixed electron efficiency of 50%). Thus, it is required that one of the two electrons lies in the central region (\(|\eta|<2.5\)), while the other electron may be either in the central region or in the forward region up to \(|\eta|=4.9\):

* \(|\eta|<2.5\) for both electrons (C-C), or
* \(|\eta|<2.5\) for one of the two electrons and \(|\eta|<4.9\) for the other (C-F).

In the region \(2.5<|\eta|<3.2\) the calorimeters used are the EMEC and the HEC and for \(|\eta|>3.2\) the forward calorimeter (FCal) is used. Note that we can not reconstruct the electron track in the forward region (\(2.5<|\eta|<4.9\)) as the tracking system of ATLAS is limited to the region \(|\eta|<2.5\). In addition, the forward calorimeters have a coarser granularity than the central ones (a factor 2 in both eta and phi directions). Figure 14 shows the the E\({}_{T}\) distribution of electron for events with at least one electron in the central region.

Using the forward electrons we gain about 30% in the statistics as shown in figure 14, where we compare the di-electron \(p_{T}\) distribution in the two analysis cases, C-C and C-F. Furthermore the value of the asymmetry is higher in the C-F events. The expected numbers of the signal and background events of each process are shown in table 2 in the two analysis regions, C-C and C-F.

Event statistics corresponding to a 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) would be required for this analysis to reach a very high precision on the determination of the weak mixing angle from the forward-backward asymmetry measurement. Nevertheless the measurement can be also made at low luminosity in order to test the consistency with the Standard Model. This can be done as function of \(M_{e^{+}e^{-}}\) to enhance sensitivity to possible deviations at high mass scales.

### A\({}_{FB}\) calculation

The forward-backward asymmetry is calculated according to Eqs 9 and 10.

If we assume that the distribution of \(N_{F}\) and \(N_{B}\) follows a binomial distribution, then the uncertainty on the two quantities can be written as follows (which is valid only for small asymmetries): \(\sigma_{N_{F}}=\sigma_{N_{B}}=\sqrt{N_{F}N_{B}}/\sqrt{N_{F}+N_{B}}\), and the \(A_{FB}\) uncertainty is \(\sigma_{A_{FB}}=\sqrt{\frac{1-A_{FB}^{2}}{N}}\).

## 8 Electron charge identification

Any misidentification of the electron charge dilutes the asymmetry. Where possible, the charge of both electrons is measured and it is required that the signs differ. When both electrons are in the central region both charges can be measured and the condition that they have opposite charges removes the events where the charge of one of the two electrons is misidentified. In this case the forward-backward asymmetry is not significantly affected by charge misidentification.

The situation is different when one electron is forward and the other central. Only the charge of the central electron can be measured. A misidentification of the charge of the electron changes the sign of \(\cos\theta^{*}\) and a forward event may be taken as a backward one. This effect can be corrected for if the charge misidentification fraction is known.

To measure the charge misidentification we use two methods:

* MC method We use the two electrons coming from \(Z\) and we count the number of events where the generated charge (\(q_{gen}\)) and reconstructed charge (\(q_{reco}\)) of the individual electrons differ. We define the charge misidentification fraction as follow: \[r=\frac{N(q_{reco}\neq q_{gen})}{N_{tot}}.\] (16)
* Tag and probe method This method is used with the tag electron \(e_{1}\) having the tight electron requirements, p\({}_{T}>\)20 GeV and \(|\eta|<1.5\). The tag and probe electron pair must have a dielectron mass within \(\pm\)6 GeV of \(M_{Z}\). The rate at which the second electron \(e_{2}\) has the same charge gives an estimation of the charge misidentification fraction.

The true asymmetry can be deduced from the raw asymmetry using the relation:

\[A_{FB_{true}}=\frac{A_{FB}-r_{+}+r_{-}}{1-r_{+}-r_{-}}. \tag{17}\]

where \(r_{-}\) is the fraction of true \(e^{-}\) misidentified as \(e^{+}\) and \(r_{+}\) is the fraction of true \(e^{+}\) misidentified as \(e^{-}\).

Figure 15 shows the misidentification fraction as function of the electron pseudo-rapidity obtained with these two methods. The misidentification fraction is small. The difference between the misidentification fraction for \(e^{+}\) and \(e^{-}\) is shown in figure 16.

## 9 Effect of pile-up

Pile-up originates from the fact that several \(pp\) collisions can occur during the same bunch crossing. This causes extra activity in the detector and therefore influences the event selection. The effect of pile-up is assessed by superimposing additional events on top of the signal when events are simulated; hits from several bunch crossings are overlaid. In this study, pile-up events corresponding to 10\({}^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) were investigated.

The pile-up affects the electron selection efficiency due to the presence of additional activity in the events. Figure 17 displays the electron identification efficiency with and without pile-up. We can see also in Table 3 the summary of the results for the C-C and C-F events, after all selection cuts. The results show a loss of about 3% of signal events.

## 10 Systematic Uncertainties

We have considered several sources of systematic uncertainties. There are PDF uncertainties and experimental ones including the energy scale, energy resolution, reconstruction efficiency and the background estimation.

### Parton Distribution Functions

Since the vector and axial vector couplings of the \(u\) and \(d\) quarks to the \(Z\) boson are different, the forward-backward asymmetry is expected to depend on the ratio of the \(u\) and \(d\) quark parton distribution function. Thus, the choice of the parton distribution functions (PDFs) will affect the measured lepton forward-backward asymmetry.

The MRST PDF parametrization [6] is used to assess the uncertainty arising from the PDFs. Thirty eigenvectors are used in this parametrization to indicate the effect of \(\pm 1\sigma\) variations. Figure 18 shows the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) asymmetry for each eigenvector. The deviation of A\({}_{FB}\) from the central value is of the same order of magnitude as the statistical accuracy.

To study the effect of the PDFs on the asymmetry, a PDF reweighting technique is used to reduce the need for Monte Carlo generations and simulation. Thus, we generate the events with the best fit central value (\(PDF_{0}\)) and then we reweight to \(PDF_{i}\) of the set \(i\) by weighting each event via:

\[\frac{f_{PDF_{i}}(x_{1},Q^{2},flav_{1}).f_{PDF_{i}}(x_{2},Q^{2},flav_{2})}{f_{ PDF_{i}}(x_{1},Q^{2},flav_{1}).f_{PDF_{i}}(x_{2},Q^{2},flav_{2})} \tag{18}\]

where \(xf_{PDF}(x,Q^{2},flav)\) is the parton momentum distribution for flavour, \(flav\), at scale, \(Q^{2}\), and momentum fraction, \(x\).

### Background subtraction

The determination of \(A_{FB}\) (with real data) requires knowledge of the number of background events and the forward-backward charge asymmetry of the background events. Thus the central value of \(A_{FB}\) we showed above can be obtained from the data events by subtracting the background events in the forward and backward regions separately from the \(raw\) forward-backward asymmetry. The number of background events estimated thus gives rise to a source of systematic uncertainties on \(A_{FB}\).

The systematic uncertainty is evaluated by varying the estimated numbers of background events by 30%. The uncertainty value is taken as the shift in A\({}_{FB}\). The largest shift is less than 0.01%.

Figure 17: Effect of pile-up on the electron identification efficiency. The reference pile-up luminosity used is \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\).

### Detector performance

Various effects due to uncertainties on the knowledge of the detector performance have to be taken into account:

Energy scaleThe electron energy scale uncertainty, which arises from calorimeter calibration uncertainties, affects the forward-backward asymmetry by causing a shift in the \(e^{+}e^{-}\) invariant mass over which we integrate A\({}_{FB}\). The effect is significant in the Z-pole region as can be seen in Figure 1. To take these effects into account, the central calorimeter scale is varied by 0.1% and the forward calorimeter scale is varied by 0.5% to estimate the systematic uncertainties. The positive and negative variations are considered separately and the largest shift is taken as the uncertainty.

Reconstruction efficiencyThe impact of the uncertainties on the electron reconstruction in the A\({}_{FB}\) measurement can be estimated by removing 0.2% and 0.5% fraction of the reconstructed electrons in the central region and forward region respectively. These values used here are based on our study on the forward calorimeters reconstruction.

Energy resolutionThe forward backward asymmetry is sensitive to the variations in the energy resolution. These variations are mainly due to the dead material distribution, known with an insufficient accuracy. To evaluate the impact of this contribution the central electron energy is degraded by an extra-term 0.01 E\({}_{T}\) and the forward calorimeter energy by 0.05 E\({}_{T}\).

Charge identificationA systematic variation in charge misidentification fraction would directly translate into uncertainties of the forward-backward asymmetry. The systematic uncertainty is estimated by comparing the measurement as performed as in the data (tag and probe method), to that using the true Monte Carlo. As it is shown in figure 15 a difference of about 0.1% is observed.

Table 4 reports all the systematic uncertainties at 100 fb\({}^{-1}\). As expected, the dominant contribution to the overall uncertainty is from the PDF uncertainties.

## 11 Results

Figure 19 shows the dielectron invariant mass spectrum expected in terms of the number of events per GeV for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) after the application of cuts **C1**, **C3** and **C4**. The yellow histogram corresponds to the signal contribution. The light blue displays the contributions from dijet events. The green and violet histograms display the contribution of \(W+X\) and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds respectively. The background contributions were obtained with MC samples with a fast detector simulation. The signal contribution was obtained with a full detector simulation.

Table 2 shows the expected number of background and signal events for 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity after the application of cuts **C1**-**C4**. It indicates that the contribution from background events is at the level of 0.2%.

In Figure 20 we display the variation of the charge asymmetry versus the rapidity of the two electrons. It is observed that the asymmetry increases when allowing the second electron to be up to \(|\eta|=4.9\). Using \(|y_{e^{+}e^{-}}|>\)1 and going from C-C to C-F events, the integrated asymmetry increases from 1.3%

to 2.7%. The precision on the forward-backward asymmetry improves from 3.7\(\times 10^{-4}\) to 2.7\(\times 10^{-4}\).

Using the parameters \(a=0.23\pm 0.03\) and \(b=1.832\pm 0.255\), of Eqs. 11, derived from the linear fit of the figure 21, we can estimate the error expected for \(\sin^{2}\theta_{eff}^{lept}\) from a measurement of the forward-backward asymmetry at the \(Z\) pole, for an integrated luminosity of 100 fb\({}^{-1}\):

\[\delta\sin^{2}\theta_{eff}^{lept}=(1.5(\mathrm{stat})\pm 0.3(\mathrm{exp})\pm 2.4(\mathrm{PDF}))\times 10^{-4} \tag{19}\]

## 12 Conclusion

We report on a detailed study of the forward-backward charge asymmetry \(A_{FB}\), at LHC with the ATLAS detector, of electron pairs resulting from the process \(pp\to Z/\gamma^{*}X\to e^{+}e^{-}X\). This measurement provides a test of the Standard Model. In the vicinity of the \(Z\)-pole this measurement can be

used to determine the effective weak mixing angle \(\sin^{2}\theta^{lept}_{eff}\). The precision on \(\sin^{2}\theta^{lept}_{eff}\) obtained is \(\delta\sin^{2}\theta^{lept}_{eff}=(1.5(\mathrm{stat})\pm 0.3(\mathrm{exp})\pm 2.4( \mathrm{PDF}))\times 10^{-4}\) for a 12 GeV mass window around the \(Z\) mass, and 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. Electron identification in the forward region (\(2.5<|\eta|<4.9\)) of the ATLAS detector is very important for the measurement. In this region an electron ID efficiency of 80% is achieved with less than 3% QCD background.

The main systematic effects relevant for forward-backward asymmetry measurements with 100 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data are addressed, including systematic uncertainties on detector effects and MRST PDF uncertainty. An advanced technique was developed and used to estimate the error due to the PDF uncertainties. This study showed that the uncertainty in the weak mixing angle determination due to PDF's is of the same order as the measurement statistical error, which means that the precision on the weak mixing angle at LHC can be competitive to the current world average. In addition we expect that in the future the knowledge of the PDF's will improve from the constraints imposed by Tevatron, HERA and first LHC measurements (e.g. using \(W\) asymmetry), and the systematic uncertainty due the uncertainty in the PDF's should decrease by the time ATLAS high luminosity data is available. If this is not the case, the asymmetry measurements can be used, conversely, to constrain the parton distribution functions.
