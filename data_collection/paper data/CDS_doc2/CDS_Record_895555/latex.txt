**Abstract**

The ATLAS experiment sensitivity to Flavour Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) top quark decays was studied. Different analyses, corresponding to the \(t(\bar{t})\to q(\bar{q})X\) (\(X=Z,\gamma\)) decay channels are presented. The branching ratio sensitivity to FCNC top quark decays were obtained assuming a \(5\sigma\) signal significance and, in the hypothesis of absence of signal, expected limits at 95% confidence level were derived.

Flavour Changing Neutral Currents (FCNC) are strongly suppressed in the Standard Model (SM) due to the Glashow-Iliopoulos-Maiani (GIM) mechanism [1]. Although absent at tree level, small FCNC contributions are expected at one loop level, according to the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) mixing matrix [2]. In the top quark sector of the SM these contributions limit the FCNC decay branching ratios to the gauge bosons, \(BR_{t\to qX}\) (\(X=Z,\gamma\)), to below \(10^{-10}\). There are however extensions of the SM, like supersymmetry (SUSY) [3], multi-Higgs doublet models [4] and models with exotic (vector-like) quarks [5], which predict FCNC contributions already at tree level and significantly enhance the FCNC decay branching ratios compared to the SM predictions.

Due to its large mass, much higher than any other known fermion, the top quark is a very good laboratory to look for physics beyond the SM. If the top quark has FCNC anomalous couplings to the gauge bosons, its decay properties are affected, giving rise to other decay channels in addition to the dominant \(t\to bW\). Indeed, one of the most prominent signatures of FCNC processes at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) would be the direct observation of a top quark decaying into a charm or an up quark together with a \(\gamma\) or \(Z\) boson. In the effective Lagrangian approach [6, 7] the widths corresponding to these decays,

\[\Gamma(t\to q\gamma)=\left(\frac{\kappa_{tq}^{\gamma}}{\Lambda}\right)^{2}2 \alpha m_{t}^{3}, \tag{1}\]

\[\Gamma(t\to qZ)_{\gamma}=\left(|v_{tq}^{Z}|^{2}+|a_{tq}^{Z}|^{2}\right) \alpha m_{t}^{3}\frac{1}{4M_{Z}^{2}\sin^{2}2\theta_{W}}\left(1-\frac{M_{Z}^{2} }{m_{t}^{2}}\right)^{2}\left(1+2\frac{M_{Z}^{2}}{m_{t}^{2}}\right), \tag{2}\]

\[\Gamma(t\to qZ)_{\sigma}=\left(\frac{\kappa_{tq}^{Z}}{\Lambda}\right)^{2} \alpha\,m_{t}^{3}\frac{1}{\sin^{2}2\theta_{W}}\left(1-\frac{M_{Z}^{2}}{m_{t}^{ 2}}\right)^{2}\left(2+\frac{M_{Z}^{2}}{m_{t}^{2}}\right), \tag{3}\]

can be expressed in terms of the \(\kappa_{tq}^{\gamma}\), (\(|v_{tq}^{Z}|^{2}+|a_{tq}^{Z}|^{2}\)) and \(\kappa_{tq}^{Z}\) anomalous couplings to the \(\gamma\) and \(Z\) bosons. The energy scale associated with this new physics is represented by \(\Lambda\), while \(\alpha\) is the electromagnetic coupling constant. The electroweak mixing angle is represented by \(\theta_{W}\) and the top and \(Z\) masses are represented, respectively, by \(m_{t}\) and \(M_{Z}\).

Although FCNC processes associated with the production [8, 9] and decay [10] of top quarks have been studied at colliders (\(BR_{t\to Zu(c)}<33\%\) and \(BR_{t\to\gamma u(c)}<3.2\%\)) [10]), the data collected up to now is not comparable with the statistics expected at the LHC. With a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and a design luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), the LHC will be a "top factory", with a \(t\bar{t}\) production cross-section of 833 pb [11] and 317 pb [12, 13, 14] for single top production.

This paper is devoted to the study of the ATLAS experiment sensitivity [15] to the FCNC decays in single top events (produced via the SM \(t\)-channel, _c.f._ Fig 1). Both the \(t\to Zu(c)\) (with \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\), \(\ell=e,\mu\)) and \(t\to\gamma u(c)\) channels were studied.

This paper is organized as follows. After the introduction, a description of the signal and background is performed in section 2. The analysis criteria for the different channels under study are described in section 3 and in section 4 the results are discussed.

Signal and background simulation

The Monte Carlo (MC) generation of the QCD (\(b\bar{b}\)), \(W\)+jets, \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)+jets, \(WW\), \(ZZ\) and \(ZW\) background processes was done with the library PYTHIA 6.206 [16]. The single top and SM (\(t\bar{t}\)) processes were generated using TopReX 4.10 [17]. TopReX was also used to generate signal samples, where the top quark1 is produced in \(pp\) collisions through the SM \(t\)-channel2 and decays via FCNC into \(qZ\) or \(q\gamma\) (_c.f._ Fig. 1). The anomalous couplings to the \(\gamma\) and \(Z\) bosons were set to \(\kappa_{tq}^{\gamma}=(|v_{tq}^{Z}|^{2}+|a_{tq}^{Z}|^{2})^{1/2}=\kappa_{tq}^{Z}=0.1\) and \(\Lambda\) was set to 1 TeV. Both background and signal events were passed through the ATLAS fast simulation ATLFAST 2.53 [18] and ATLFASTB packages. The \(b\)-jet tagging efficiency was set to 60% (the rejection factor of \(c\)-jets is 10 and of light quarks jets is 100). The charged lepton identification efficiency is assumed to be 90%. Initial State Radiation (ISR) and Final State Radiation (FSR) were both taken into account in the event generation. The CTEQ5L Parton Distribution Functions [16, 17] were used. All the simulated events were normalized to a luminosity of \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\).

Footnote 1: Throughout this paper, the antiparticle (_i.e._ the anti-top) is implicitly assumed.

Footnote 2: This is the process of the single top production at the LHC with highest cross-section (\(\sigma=250\) pb [12]).

## 3 Topologies and event selection

The final states corresponding to the FCNC decays of the top quark lead to different topologies according to the number of leptons, photons and jets: while the \(t\to Zu(c)\) channel is characterized by the presence of two charged leptons3 (from the leptonic decay of the \(Z\)), in the \(t\to\gamma u(c)\) decay channel one energetic photon is expected in the final state. Specific preselection and final selection criteria, followed by a probabilistic type of analysis, were applied for each channel, as described below.

Footnote 3: Only isolated leptons and photons were considered. The isolation criteria requires the absence of additional tracks with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV/\(c\) inside a cone of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{(\Delta\phi)^{2}+(\Delta\eta)^{2}}=0.4\) around the lepton (photon) direction.

### \(t\to Zu(c)\) channel

The topology corresponding to this decay channel is characterized by the presence of two energetic charged leptons and jets in the final state. At the preselection level, events were accepted if they have two (and only two) leptons with opposite charges, the same flavour (_i.e._, \(\ell^{+}\ell^{-}=e^{+}e^{-},\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\)), transverse momentum (\(p_{T}\)) above 25 GeV/\(c\) and the absolute value of the pseudo-rapidity \(|\eta|\) below 2.5. Additionally, at least two jets with \(p_{T}>50\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) were required. The distributions of some relevant variables at this level are shown in Fig. 2. The corresponding number of selected background events (normalized to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) and the signal efficiency (convoluted with the branching ratio of the decay \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\)) are shown in Table 1.

The \(Z\) mass (Fig. 2e) was assumed to be the invariant mass of the two leptons. The top mass (\(m_{t}\)) was defined as the invariant mass of the reconstructed \(Z\) and the jet which minimizes the difference \(|m_{t}-175\) GeV/\(c^{2}|\) (Fig. 2f).

In the final selection, events were required to have less than two \(b\)-tagged jets, the missing transverse momentum below 25 GeV/\(c\), a transverse momentum of the jet used to reconstruct the top above 50 GeV/\(c\) and a reconstructed top mass between 150 GeV/\(c^{2}\) and 200 GeV/\(c^{2}\). The number of selected background events and the signal efficiency after the final selection are shown in Table 1.

Following the final selection, a probabilistic type of analysis was applied. Signal (\({\cal P}_{i}^{signal}\)) and background-like (\({\cal P}_{i}^{back.}\)) probabilities were computed using Probability Density Functions (p.d.f.), constructed from relevant physical variables. The signal \({\cal L}_{S}=\Pi_{i=1}^{n}P_{i}^{signal}\) and background \({\cal L}_{B}=\Pi_{i=1}^{n}P_{i}^{back.}\) likelihoods (\(n\) is the number of p.d.f.) were used to built a discriminant variable (\(L_{R}\)), defined as \({\cal L}_{S}/{\cal L}_{B}\).

For the \(t\to Zu(c)\) decay channel the p.d.f. were constructed based on the following physical distributions (_c.f._ Fig. 3):

* the top invariant mass;
* the transverse momentum of the jet used in the top mass reconstruction;
* the transverse momentum of the jet with the second highest \(p_{T}\) (\(j_{2}\)), and
* the angle between the reconstructed \(Z\) and \(j_{2}\).

The SM background and signal \(L-R\) distributions, after the final selection, are shown in Fig. 4.

### \(t\rightarrow\gamma u(c)\) channel

The topology corresponding to this channel is characterized by the presence of one energetic photon and jets in the final state. Events were preselected by requiring only one photon with \(p_{T}>75\) GeV/\(c\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\), and at least two jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\). Additionally, the events were required to have the leading jet with \(p_{T}>25\) GeV/\(c\) and at most one \(b\)-tagged jet. The preselection was completed by rejecting events with charged leptons with transverse momentum above 5 GeV/\(c\). The distributions of some relevant variables after the preselection are shown in Fig. 5. The corresponding number of selected background events (normalized to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) and signal efficiency at the preselection are shown in Table 2.

The reconstruction of the top mass (\(m_{j_{1}}\gamma\)) was done by evaluatig the invariant mass of the leading jet and the photon (Fig. 5d). In the final selection, events were required to have \(m_{j_{1}}\gamma\) between 100 GeV/\(c^{2}\) and 220 GeV/\(c^{2}\). The number of selected background events and the signal efficiency after the final selection are shown in Table 2.

As for the \(t\to Zu(c)\) channel, a probabilistic type of analysis was applied to background and signal events. The following variables were used to build the p.d.f. (_c.f._ Fig. 6):

* the top invariant mass;
* the transverse momentum of the photon (\(p_{T\gamma}\));

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline MC samples & preselection & final selection \\ \hline \hline \(Z/\gamma^{*}\)+jets & 43339.7 & 12223.7 \\ \hline \(WW\),\(ZZ\),\(ZW\) & 584.5 & 138.7 \\ \hline single \(t\) & 256.3 & 8.5 \\ \hline \(tt\) & 35527.4 & 987.1 \\ \hline \hline total SM & 79707.9 & 13358.0 \\ \hline \hline \(\varepsilon_{t}=\varepsilon\times BR_{Z\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}}\) (\%) & 0.88 & 0.62 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The number of selected background events (normalized to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) and the signal efficiencies (convoluted with the branching ratio of the decay \(Z\rightarrow\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\)), for the \(t\to Zu(c)\) channel, are shown for the preselection and final selection levels.

* the invariant mass of the two jets with highest \(p_{T}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) (\(m_{j_{1}j_{2}}\));
* the pseudo-rapidity of \(j_{2}\) (\(\eta_{j_{2}}\));
* the angle between the photon and \(j_{2}\) (\(\alpha_{\gamma j_{2}}\)), and
* the angle between the leading jet and \(j_{2}\) (\(\alpha_{j_{1}j_{2}}\)).

The SM and signal discriminant variable distributions are shown in Fig. 7.

## 4 Results and limits

The expected branching ratios for the FCNC top decays were estimated under two different hypothesis, as explained in the next subsections.

### Branching ratio sensitivity (\(5\sigma\) significance discovery hypothesis)

Assuming a signal discovery with a \(5\sigma\) significance, the branching ratio (\(BR\)) sensitivity for each channel is estimated by:

\[BR=\frac{5\sqrt{B}}{L\times\sigma\times\varepsilon_{t}\times\varepsilon_{\ell} }\,, \tag{4}\]

where \(\sigma=250\) pb [12] is the NLO calculation of the SM cross-section for the single top \(t\)-channel production in \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. \(B\) is the total number of selected background events, \(\varepsilon_{t}\) is the signal efficiency convoluted with the appropriate branching ratios and \(\varepsilon_{\ell}=0.9^{n}\) is the charged leptons identification efficiency (\(n\) is the number of leptons required in each channel).

In order to improve the signal to background ratio, a cut was applied to the discriminant variables (Table 3). This cut was optimized according to the best \(S/\sqrt{B}\) (\(S\) is the number of selected signal events). The expected branching ratio sensitivities for a \(5\sigma\) discovery are shown in Table 4.

\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|} \hline channel & \(L_{R}\) cut & \(B\) & \(\varepsilon_{t}\) (\% ) \\ \hline \hline \(t\to Zu(c)\) & \(>4.7\) & 24.1 & 0.05 \\ \hline \(t\to\gamma u(c)\) & \(>2.6\) & 88.3 & 1.79 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

_Table 3: The number of selected background events (normalized to \(L=10\) fb\({}^{-1}\)) and signal efficiencies (convoluted with the appropriate branching ratios) for each channel, after the given \(L_{R}\) cut, are shown._

### 95% confidence level limits (absence of signal hypothesis)

In the absence of a FCNC top decay signal, the expected limits at 95% confidence level (CL) can be derived using the modified frequentist likelihood method [20]. In this case the full information of the discriminant variables were used to derive 95% CL upper limits on the number of signal events for each channel. No cuts on the discriminant variables were used. Using the NLO calculation for the cross-section of the single top \(t\)-channel production, these limits were then converted into limits on the branching ratio for each of the studied FCNC top decay channels. The expected 95% confidence level limits on the branching ratios are summarized in Table 5.

## 5 Conclusions

A study of the ATLAS sensitivity to FCNC decays of top quarks in single top events (produced via the SM \(t\)-channel) was presented. The obtained results are of the order of \(10^{-2}\) (\(10^{-3}\)) for the \(t\to Zu(c)\) (\(t\to\gamma u(c)\)) channel. These results complement those obtained for the \(t\bar{t}\) production with top FCNC decays [21, 22, 23, 24].
