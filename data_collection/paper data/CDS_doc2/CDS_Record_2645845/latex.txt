**ATLAS sensitivity to Two-Higgs-Doublet models with an additional pseudoscalar exploiting four top quark signatures with 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of \(\sqrt{s}\) = 14 TeV proton-proton collisions**

The ATLAS Collaboration

This document summarises the expected ATLAS sensitivity to four top-quark signatures in models involving two Higgs doublets and an additional pseudo-scalar mediator that couples to dark matter particles. The sensitivity is estimated using 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions in the context of the High Luminosity LHC update. The experimental signatures investigated include at least two charged leptons with the same electric charge or at least three leptons.

## 1 Introduction

A class of simplified models for dark matter (DM) searches at the LHC involving a two-Higgs-doublet extended sector together with an additional pseudo-scalar mediator to DM [1; 2] (denoted as 2HDM+\(a\)) are considered. This category of models represent one of the simplest ultra-violet (UV) complete and renormalisable frameworks to investigate the broad phenomenology predicted by spin-0 mediator-based DM models [2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; 11; 12; 13; 14; 15; 16]. In these models, the 2HDM sector consists of a type-II coupling structure [17; 18]. Furthermore, the alignment (\(\cos(\beta-\alpha)=0\)) and decoupling limit is assumed, such that the lightest CP-even state of the Higgs-sector, \(h\), can be identified with the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and the electroweak vacuum-expectation-value (VEV), \(\nu\), is set to \(246\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The additional pseudo-scalar mediator of the model, \(a\), couples the DM particles to the SM and mixes with the pseudo-scalar partner of the SM Higgs boson, \(A\). Following the prescriptions in Ref. [2], the masses of the heavy CP-even Higgs boson, \(H\), and charged bosons, \(H^{\pm}\), are set equal to the mass of the heavy CP-odd partner \(m_{A}\), while the the three quartic couplings between the scalar doublets and the \(a\) boson (\(\lambda_{P1},\lambda_{P2}\) and \(\lambda_{3}\)) are all set equal to 3, in order to simplify the phenomenology and evade the constraints from electroweak precision measurements. In addition, to reduce the multiplicity of the parameter space we consider unitary couplings between the \(a\) and the DM particle \(\chi\) (\(y_{\chi}=1\)) and we fix the DM particle mass to \(10\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\). The ratio of the VEVs of the two Higgs-doublets, \(\tan\beta\), is set to unity as well. This model is characterised by a rich phenomenology and can produce very different final states according to the production and decay modes for the various bosons composing the Higgs sector, which can decay both into dark matter or SM particles. The four-top signature is particularly interesting in this model if at least some of the neutral Higgs partners masses are kept above the \(t\bar{t}\) threshold, since, when kinematically allowed, all four neutral bosons can contribute to this final state, as depicted in Fig. 1. The total four top-quark production cross-section is dominated by the light pseudo-scalar and the heavy scalar bosons. In order to highlight this interplay, four benchmark models will be considered, assuming different choices for the mass of the light CP-odd and heavy CP-even bosons and the mixing angle between the two CP-odd weak eigenstates (\(\sin\theta\)).

**Scenario 1**: \(m_{a}\) sensitivity scan assuming:

* \(m_{H}=600\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(\sin\theta=0.35\).
* \(m_{H}=1\,\,\mathrm{TeV}\), \(\sin\theta=0.7\).
**Scenario 2**: \(\sin\theta\) sensitivity scan assuming:
* \(m_{H}=600\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\), \(m_{a}=200\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\).
* \(m_{H}=1\,\,\mathrm{TeV}\), \(m_{a}=350\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\).

Scenario 1a and Scenario 2 closely follow the DM Working Group recommendations and are therefore ideal benchmarks to compare the four top-quarks signature with other final states that characterise the phenomenology of this model [2]. The production cross section of the four benchmark scenarios are presented in Figure 2. It is found that for \(m_{H}=600\,\,\mathrm{GeV}\), the kinematic properties of the signal is relatively independent of \(m_{a}\) (except for masses below the top-quark threshold) and of the mixing angle. Conversely, when the heavy scalar Higgs boson is chosen to be heavier (\(m_{H}=1\,\,\mathrm{TeV}\)), the mass of the light pseudo-scalar and the mixing angle choice play an important role in determining the kinematic properties of the final state. This note considers four top-quarks final states involving at least two leptons with the same electric charge or at least three or more leptons. Final states with high jet multiplicity and one lepton are also very powerful to constrain these signature [19], but are not considered in this note.

In the present data-taking period (Run-2), the LHC delivered \(\sim\)160 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collisions with an instantaneous luminosity of \(\sim\)2\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and an average number of collisions per bunch crossing of \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 35\). A second long shutdown (LS2) will follow, during which the injection chain is foreseen to be modified to allow for a higher instantaneous luminosity. The average number of proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing is expected to be \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 60\) and the data collected up to the next long shutdown (LS3) will amount to \(\sim\)300 fb\({}^{-1}\). An increase of the centre-of-mass-energy to 14 TeV is possible and is assumed to happen for this study. During LS3, the accelerator is foreseen to be upgraded to the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) which will be able to achieve luminosities of \(\sim\)7.5\(\times\)10\({}^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The HL-LHC is expected to deliver an average number of pile up interactions per bunch crossing of \(\langle\mu\rangle\sim 200\) and the data collected will amount to \(\sim\)3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

## 2 ATLAS detector

The ATLAS experiment [20] is a multi-purpose particle detector with a forward-backward symmetric cylindrical geometry and nearly \(4\pi\) coverage in solid angle1. The interaction point is surrounded by an inner detector (ID), a calorimeter system, and a muon spectrometer.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r\), \(\phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the beam pipe. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\). Rapidity is defined as \(y=0.5\ln\left[(E+p_{z})/(E-p_{z})\right]\) where \(E\) denotes the energy and \(p_{z}\) is the component of the momentum along the beam direction.

Upgrades to the detector and the triggering system are planned to adapt the experiment to the increasing instantaneous and integrated luminosities expected with the HL-LHC [21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27].

In the reference upgrade scenario, the ID will provide precision tracking of charged particles for pseudorapidities \(|\eta|<4.0\) and will be surrounded by a superconducting solenoid providing a 2 T axial magnetic field. It will consist of pixel and silicon-microstrip detectors.

In the pseudorapidity region \(|\eta|<3.2\), the currently installed high-granularity lead/liquid-argon (LAr) electromagnetic (EM) sampling calorimeters will be used. The current steel/scintillator tile calorimeter will measure hadron energies for \(|\eta|<1.7\). The end-cap and forward regions, spanning \(1.5<|\eta|<4.9\), currently instrumented with LAr calorimeters for both the EM and hadronic energy measurements will be upgraded with a high granularity forward calorimeter in the \(3.1<|\eta|<4.9\) range.

The muon spectrometer, consisting of three large superconducting toroids with eight coils each, a system of trigger and precision-tracking chambers, which provide triggering and tracking capabilities in the ranges \(|\eta|<2.4\) and \(|\eta|<2.7\), respectively, could be upgraded with the addition of a very forward muon tagger that will extend the trigger coverage up to \(|\eta|=4.0\).

A two-level trigger system will be used to select events, reducing the event rate to about 10 kHz. In the reference scenario, the bandwidth allocated to single lepton (\(e\) or \(\mu\)) triggers will be of \(\sim 2.2\) kHz each, with the respective thresholds set at \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>22\) GeV and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV.

## 3 Dataset and simulated event samples

Monte Carlo (MC) simulated event samples are used to predict the background from SM processes and to model the 2HDM+\(a\) signal. All samples have been generated assuming a proton-proton collision centre-of-mass energy \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. The descriptions of these samples is summarised in Table 1. The detector response is taken into account using a set of parameterised response functions based on studies performed with Geant 4 simulations [28, 29] of the upgraded detector in high luminosity conditions [30]. The most relevant MC samples have equivalent luminosities of at least 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

Signal samples are generated from leading-order (LO) matrix elements, using the aMC@NLO v2.6.1 event generator interfaced to Pythia 8.230 with the A14 tune for the modelling of the parton showering, hadronisation and the description of the underlying event. Parton luminosities are provided by the NNPDF23LO Parton Distribution Function (PDF) set. The decay of the top quarks is modelled using MadSpin [52]. The interference of the signal processes with SM four top-quark production is neglected,

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

Jets are required to be separated from candidate electrons by \(\Delta R(e,\mathrm{jet})>0.2\). Leptons are removed if they are within \(\Delta R=0.4\) of a remaining jet. Jets are identified as originating from \(b\)-decays (\(b\)-tagged) using a parameterisation (as a function of the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(\eta\)) modelling the performances of the MV2 \(b\)-tagging algorithm [55]. A requirement is chosen corresponding to a 77% average efficiency obtained for b-quark jets in simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events. The rejection factors for light-quark and gluon jets, c-quark jets and \(\tau\to\mathrm{hadrons}+\nu\) decays in simulated \(t\bar{t}\) events are approximately 380, 12 and 54, respectively [30]. The \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) at generator level is computed as the vectorial sum of the momenta of neutral weakly-interacting particles. It is then smeared to simulate the detector response, with a function parameterised in the average number of interactions per bunch crossing \(\mu\) and the scalar sum of energy in the calorimeter \(\sum E_{\mathrm{T}}\).

Events are accepted if they contain at least two electrons, two muons or one electron and one muon with the same electric charge or at least three leptons (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV). Furthermore, events are required to contain at least three \(b\)-jets. The up to four leading leptons and up to four leading \(b\)-jets in the event are grouped respectively in two systems, called \(\mathcal{S}_{\ell}\) and \(\mathcal{S}_{b}\). A signal system \(\mathcal{S}\) is defined by \(\mathcal{S}=\mathcal{S}_{\ell}\cup\mathcal{S}_{b}\).

Different discriminators and kinematic variables are used in the analysis to separate the signal from the SM background.

* \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathcal{S}_{\ell})\) : the vectorial sum of the lepton four momenta in \(\mathcal{S}_{\ell}\);
* \(\Delta R(\mathcal{S}_{\ell},\mathcal{S}_{b})\): the \(\Delta R\) between the vectorial sum of the leptons in \(\mathcal{S}_{\ell}\) and the vectorial sum of the \(b\)-jets in \(\mathcal{S}_{b}\);
* \(\mathrm{m}(\mathcal{S})\): the invariant mass of the signal system \(\mathcal{S}\);

A common selection is applied to all events, before further categorisations. Events are required to have at least two jets with a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>50\) GeV. In events with exactly two (anti-)electrons, the contribution of SM processes including an on-shell \(Z\) boson decaying leptonically with a lepton charge misidentification is reduced by vetoing events with \(81.2\) GeV \(<m_{\ell\ell}<101.2\) GeV. Furthermore, low mass resonances are vetoed by requiring \(m_{\ell\ell}>15\) GeV. Figure 3 shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathcal{S}_{\ell})\) and \(\Delta R(\mathcal{S}_{\ell},\mathcal{S}_{b})\) distributions for events passing all the requirements described so far.

Two signal regions (SR) are defined selecting events with exactly two charged leptons with the same electric charge (denoted Same-Sign) or three or more charged leptons (denoted Multi-lep). A summary of the selections is presented in Table 2.

Figure 4 shows four key distributions (\(\Delta R(\mathcal{S}_{\ell},\mathcal{S}_{b})\), \(p_{\mathrm{T}}(\mathcal{S}_{\ell})\), \(b\)-jet multiplicity, \(m(\mathcal{S})\)) for events passing one set of SRs requirements except for the requirement on the shown variable itself. The main backgrounds that survive the selections are the irreducible \(t\bar{t}\)\(t\bar{t}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) +V/h.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l c c} \hline  & Same-Sign & Multi-lep \\ \hline Lepton multiplicity (\(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV) & exactly 2 (same charge) & \(\geq\) 3 \\  & (\(>15\) AND \(<81.2\)) & \\ \(m_{\ell\ell}\) allowed intervals [GeV] & OR & – \\  & \(>101.2\) & \\ \(p_{\rm T}({\cal S}_{\ell})\) [GeV] & \(>50\) & \(>100\) \\ \hline \(b\)-jet multiplicity (\(p_{\rm T}>25\) GeV) & \(>3\) & \(>2\) \\ \(b\)-jet multiplicity (\(p_{\rm T}>50\) GeV) & – & \(>1\) \\ Jet multiplicity (\(p_{\rm T}>50\) GeV) & \(>3\) & \(>1\) \\ \hline \(\Delta R({\cal S}_{\ell},{\cal S}_{b})\) & \(<2.5\) & \(<2.5\) \\ \hline \(m({\cal S})\) [GeV] & - & \(>550\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

## 5 Systematic uncertainties

The projection of systematic uncertainties determined starting from those studied in Ref [56] have been used. A sensible extrapolation has been developed by ATLAS and CMS Collaborations which is documented in Ref. [30]. The theory modelling uncertainties are expected to halve, while different recommendations have been provided for detector-level and experimental uncertainties.

In Ref. [56], the dominant uncertainties were due to theoretical modelling of the irreducible backgrounds (32%), the jet energy scale (JES - 6%) and resolution (JER - 6%), the b-tagging efficiency (7%) and the modelling of the fake and non-prompt lepton background. Owing to the reduced statistical uncertainty and a better understanding of the physics models, it is expected that JES, JER, b-tagging efficiency and irreducible background modelling uncertainties will all be reduced. It is assumed that they will all be halved by the end of the HL-LHC running. This leads to an estimate of the total background uncertainty of about 20%.

The resulting experimental uncertainty is assumed to be fully correlated between the background and the signal when setting 95% CL exclusion limits. Furthermore, an additional systematic of 5% is considered for the signal, in order to account for the theoretical systematic uncertainty on the model. For the expected discovery \(p\)-values values, only the uncertainty on the background is considered.

## 6 Results

Table 3 shows the expected yields in the SR for each background source, together with few benchmark signal models. The dominant contribution to the \(t\bar{t}\) +V/h processes is \(t\bar{t}\) +h for the Same-Sign SR and \(t\bar{t}\) +\(Z\) for the Multi-lep SR.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l r r} \hline \hline  & Same-Sign SR & Multi-lep SR \\ \hline Expected Standard Model & \(27.4\pm 5.2\) & \(38.4\pm 6.4\) \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) and single-top & \(7.9\pm 1.5\) & \(9.1\pm 1.5\) \\ \(t\bar{t}\) +V/h & \(4.94\pm 0.94\) & \(17.5\pm 2.9\) \\ \(t\bar{t}\)\(t\bar{t}\) & \(14.5\pm 2.8\) & \(10.9\pm 1.8\) \\ Others & \(0.110\pm 0.020\) & \(0.86\pm 0.14\) \\ \hline \((m_{a}\) GeV, \(m_{H}\) GeV, \(\sin\theta)\) & & \\ \((200,600,0.05)\) & \(31.7\pm 4.8\) & \(38.9\pm 5.8\) \\ \((200,600,0.50)\) & \(17.4\pm 2.6\) & \(17.4\pm 2.6\) \\ \((200,600,0.95)\) & \(6.06\pm 0.91\) & \(7.0\pm 1.1\) \\ \((250,1000,0.70)\) & \(1.33\pm 0.20\) & \(3.32\pm 0.50\) \\ \((250,600,0.35)\) & \(24.2\pm 3.6\) & \(25.2\pm 3.8\) \\ \((350,1000,0.05)\) & \(9.5\pm 1.4\) & \(4.95\pm 0.74\) \\ \((350,1000,0.50)\) & \(5.03\pm 0.75\) & \(5.63\pm 0.84\) \\ \((350,1000,0.95)\) & \(32.9\pm 4.9\) & \(36.0\pm 5.4\) \\ \((550,1000,0.70)\) & \(10.7\pm 1.6\) & \(11.4\pm 1.7\) \\ \((550,600,0.35)\) & \(30.5\pm 4.6\) & \(34.9\pm 5.2\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Expected yields in the SRs together with their statistical uncertainties, for an integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The expected numbers of events for few signal samples are also reported.

The HistFitter framework [57], which utilises a profile-likelihood-ratio test statistics [58], is used to compute expected discovery \(p\)-values. In case there is no excess seen in this channel, expected exclusion limits with the \(\text{CL}_{s}\) prescription [59] are also calculated.

Scans of expected discovery \(p\)-values and expected exclusion limits at 95% CL are shown in Figures 5 and 6, respectively, as a function of \(m_{a}\), for fixed \(m_{H}\) and \(\sin\theta\) and as a function of \(\sin\theta\) for fixed \(m_{a}\) and \(m_{H}\). In all benchmarks, it is assumed that \(\tan\beta=1\) and \(m_{\chi}=10\)\(\text{GeV}\).

For light pseudo-scalar masses above the \(t\bar{t}\) decay threshold, a significance of about \(3\sigma\) is expected if \(m_{H}=600\)\(\text{GeV}\) and \(\sin\theta=0.35\). The same benchmark is expected to be excluded for all light-pseudoscalar masses and for \(\sin\theta<0.35\) if \(m_{a}=200\)\(\text{GeV}\). Mixing angles such that \(\sin\theta>0.95\) are also expected to be excluded for \(m_{a}=350\)\(\text{GeV}\), \(m_{H}=1\)\(\text{TeV}\) and, under the same assumptions, an upper limit of about two times the theoretical cross section is set for \(\sin\theta<0.8\). Finally, \(\sin\theta<0.4\) is excluded for \(m_{H}=600\)\(\text{GeV},m_{a}=200\)\(\text{GeV}\).

In almost all cases the Same-Sign SR yields the strongest constraints on the parameter space considered in this work. However, the Multi-lep SR offers a complementary channel whose sensitivity is of the same order of magnitude. Possibly, exploiting dedicated techniques developed to suppress or better estimate the \(t\bar{t}+V\) background that affects the Multi-lep SR, this signature can achieve sensitivity comparable to the Same-Sign selection.

Figure 6: Exclusion limits at 95% CL for Same-Sign and Multi-lep SRs in terms of excluded cross-section (\(\sigma\)) over the cross-section predicted by the model (\(\sigma_{theory}\)). Limits are derived from the analysis of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of 14 TeV proton-proton collision data as a function of \(m_{a}\) (a) or as a function of \(\sin\theta\) (b) for each parameter assumptions described in Sec. 1 and indicated in the legend. The \(1\sigma\) variation of the total uncertainty on the limit is indicated as a band around each exclusion line.

## 7 Conclusion

The sensitivity to 2HDM+\(a\) models is studied using simulated ATLAS data from proton-proton collisions at the LHC design centre-of-mass-energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. Final states with with exactly two charged leptons with the same electric charge or three or more charged leptons have been considered. Emphasis has been put on four parameter scans: two scans of \(m_{a}\), for \(m_{H}=1000\) GeV, \(\tan\beta=1\), \(\sin\theta=0.7\) and for \(m_{H}=600\) GeV, \(\tan\beta=1\), \(\sin\theta=0.35\) and two scans of \(\sin\theta\), for \(m_{a}=350\) GeV, \(m_{H}=1000\) GeV, \(\tan\beta=1\) and for \(m_{a}=200\) GeV, \(m_{H}=600\) GeV, \(\tan\beta=1\). Searches are carried out with MC simulated events generated at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV, and with corrections accounting for the detector response applied to the generator-level particles. A dataset of \(3000\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\) extends the potential for evidence of a signal with \(m_{H}=600\) GeV and mixing angles of \(\sin\theta=0.35\) assuming \(m_{a}\) masses between \(400\) GeV and \(1\) TeV and the exclusion sensitivity for all \(m_{a}\) between \(200\) GeV and \(1\) TeV. The addition of fully hadronic, semi-leptonic and di-leptonic final states with different electric charge channels, which have not been considered in this study, are likely to further extend this reach. Future improvements in the understanding of experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties on the SM backgrounds would also provide additional gains in sensitivity.
