**Alignment of the ATLAS detector**

**from inner detector to muon spectrometer**

C. Daum

**Introduction**

The relative and absolute monitoring of the overall alignment of the ATLAS detector may be achieved along similar lines as discussed for the ATLAS inner detector[1] by setting up an alignment grid using precise distance measurements.

**1. Relative monitor**

Monitoring of the positions of all detectors during running is of crucial importance for following the time evolution of alignment constants needed in track reconstruction. It should provide the relative position of all detectors. The position vectors of detectors or parts of detectors are given with respect to those of reference marks. These are part of or refer to position vectors in an alignment grid. The relation to or between (e.g. across thermal insulation) reference marks and to points of the alignment grid should be mechanically stable.

The eight-fold symmetry of the toroidal coils and, therefore, of the muon spectrometer suggest the use of an octagonal grid as shown in Fig. 1. Two of these planar grids can be put in the gap between the barrel calorimeters and end cap calorimeters inside the muon spectrometer at z = -3.4 m and z = 3.4 m. The outer octagon is put at a radius of about 4.6 m and can be linked up with the muon alignment system. Inner octagons can be located at a radius of about 1.15 m and 0.3 m which are used for the monitoring of the inner detector. It may be advantageous to continue the eight-fold symmetry for the alignment of the inner detector as well. The calorimeters may be linked to the octagons at 1.15 m and 4.6 m. Additional transvere planes with an pattern consisting of the two inner octagons of Fig. 1 should be put at the transition from the barrel to the end cap part as in Ref. [1]. The transverse planes are linked by planes in the longitudinal direction as in Ref. [1].

#### Analysis of the transverse planes.

As described in [1], the length of the sides of the octagons and the distance of non-adjacent points with one adjacent point in between are measured with Frequency Scan Interferometry (FSI ) [2]. The radial distances between the corner points of different octagons should also be determined. Fig. 1 illustrates the alignment strategy as described in Ref. [1]. We shall describe first the analysis of the individual octagons and not make use of the distance measurements between the corners of different octagons.

The distances between successive points of the octagon and between even or odd numbered points on the circumference of the octagon. Distances can be measured with e.g. FSI [2] with a few micron precision. The aim is to reconstruct the cylindrical coordinates r and \(\phi\) of the corner points 1 to 8.

For the ideal octagon, we have the relations

\[r_{1}=r_{2}=r_{3}=r_{4}=r_{5}=r_{6}=r_{7}=r_{8}=r \tag{1}\]

\[d_{12}=d_{23}=d_{34}=d_{45}=d_{56}=d_{67}=d_{78}=d_{81}=2r\sin\frac{\pi c}{8} \tag{2}\]

Figure 1: Planar octagonal alignment grid.

and

\[\phi_{\rm i}=({\rm i}-1)\,\frac{\pi}{4}\] (3),

for \({\rm i}=1\) to \(8\).

The cosine rule in triangles between the origin and two adjacent corner points is

\[{\rm d}_{\rm ik}^{2}=r_{\rm i}^{2}+r_{\rm k}^{2}-2r_{\rm i}r_{\rm k}\cos(\phi_{ \rm k}-\phi_{\rm i})\] (4).

The cosine rule in triangles between two odd or even numbered corner points is given by the same expression.

We have to solve for eight values of \(r_{\rm i}\) and eight values of \(\phi_{\rm i}\). The problem can be linearized by determining the deviations from the ideal octagon. We take as a first estimate of the radii and the sides of the octagon

\[r=\frac{1}{8}\,({\rm d}_{12}+{\rm d}_{23}+{\rm d}_{34}+{\rm d}_{45}+{\rm d}_{56 }+{\rm d}_{67}+{\rm d}_{78}+{\rm d}_{81})\,/\,2{\rm sin}\frac{\pi}{8}={\rm d}\,/ \,2{\rm sin}\frac{\pi}{8}\] (5),

and for the angles the values of Eq. 3.

The measured deviations from these value are

\[\Delta{\rm d}_{\rm ik}={\rm d}_{\rm ik}-{\rm d}\] (6).

The deviations of \(r_{\rm i}\) and \(\phi_{\rm i}\) from the ideal value are \(\Delta r_{\rm i}\) and \(\Delta\phi_{\rm i}\). Differentiation of Eq. 4 and substitution of the ideal values yields eight equations

\[\Delta{\rm d}_{\rm ik}\,2{\rm sin}\frac{\pi}{8}=\Delta r_{\rm i}\,(1-\cos \frac{\pi}{4})+\Delta r_{\rm k}\,(1-\cos\frac{\pi}{4})-r\,{\rm sin}\,\frac{\pi} {4}\,\Delta\phi_{\rm i}+r\,{\rm sin}\,\frac{\pi}{4}\,\Delta\phi_{\rm k}\] (7).

The triangles with odd or even corner points yield another eight equations

\[\Delta{\rm d}_{\rm ik}2{\rm sin}\frac{\pi}{4}=\Delta r_{\rm i}+\Delta r_{\rm k }-2r\,\Delta\phi_{\rm i}+2r\,\Delta\phi_{\rm k}\] (8).

The measurement uncertainties of \({\rm d}_{\rm ik}\) and thus of \(\Delta{\rm d}_{\rm ik}\) are \(\delta_{\rm ik}\). We can now make a least-square fit to this system of 16 linear equations with the linear constraint

\[\sum_{\rm i}^{\rm\delta}\,\Delta\phi_{\rm i}=0 \tag{9}\]The origins and relative orientations of the three octagons do not coincide necessarily after the individual fitting procedures.

An overall fit of the three octagons is made by constructing relations for the additional measurements of the distances between the nearest corner points of adjacent octagons. In the ideal case, the radius vectors of the outer octagon O and the middle octagon O' are collinear and the vector relation

\[\mathbf{r_{kk}}=\mathbf{r_{k}}-\mathbf{r^{\prime}_{k}} \tag{10}\]

reduces to

\[\mathbf{r_{kk}}=\mathbf{r_{k}}-\mathbf{r^{\prime}_{k}}=\mathbf{r}-\mathbf{r^{ \prime}} \tag{11}\]

and

\[\mathbf{\phi_{kk}}=\mathbf{\phi_{k}}-\mathbf{\phi^{\prime}_{k}}=(\mathbf{k}-1 )\;\frac{\pi}{8}-(\mathbf{k}-1)\;\frac{\pi}{8}=0 \tag{12}\]

In reality, the vectors will form a triangle for which the cosine rule is

\[\mathbf{r_{kk}^{2}}=\mathbf{r_{k}^{2}}+\mathbf{r^{\prime}_{k}}^{2}-2\mathbf{r _{k}}\mathbf{r^{\prime}_{k}}\cos(\mathbf{\phi_{k}}-\mathbf{\phi^{\prime}_{k}}) \tag{13}\]

The measurement of the length of \(\mathbf{n_{kk}}\) with uncertainty \(\delta\mathbf{r_{kk}}\) yields

\[\Delta\mathbf{r_{kk}}=\mathbf{r_{kk}}-\mathbf{r^{\prime\prime}} \tag{14}\]

Differentiating Eq. (14) and substituting the ideal values results in eight equations

\[\Delta\mathbf{r_{kk}}=\Delta\mathbf{r_{k}}-\Delta\mathbf{r^{\prime}_{k}} \tag{15}\]

Another eight similar equations exist between the middle and inner octagons. This yields 3 x 16 + 2 x 8 = 64 linear equations with 3 x 16 parameters (\(\Delta\mathbf{r_{k}}\), \(\Delta\mathbf{\phi_{k}}\), \(\Delta\mathbf{r^{\prime}_{k}}\), \(\Delta\mathbf{\phi^{\prime}_{k}}\), \(\Delta\mathbf{\phi^{\prime\prime}_{k}}\)) with three linear constraints of the type of Eq. 9.

The FSI method is not sensitive to small displacements orthogonal to the plane for checking the deviation from the flatness of the ideal plane of the three octagons. Straightness monitors [3] may have to be added in the transverse planes, e.g. between the corner points of the three octagons on each radius vector.

The absolute position in space of the origin and the absolute orientation of the coordinate system can not be determined without a measurement to an external reference point. They are individual for each transverse plane. The relative orientation of the two planes may not be stable in time. The external reference point itself may not be stable in time.

### Analysis of the longitudinal planes.

Fig. 2 indicates how any two transverse planes can be linked by a longitudinal grid. The parallelism, the orientation, the relative height, and the distance of these planes is measured with the longitudinal grid. It has not only distance measurements between the outer corner points of the hexagonal grid in each transverse plane, but it also requires'skew', diagonal distances for the measurement of the angle between the planes of the hexagons. Longitudinal planes connect the two transverse planes. It would be sufficient to measure only one diagonal distance. However, measuring four lines provides redundancy. In the triangles 122', 123', 123' and 223' all sides are measured. Hence, all angles are determined with the cosine rule in the same way as for the transverse planes by determining the deviations from the ideal values with a least-square fit. It is not necessary to measure all diagonals in all longitudinal rectangles. It is sufficieient to measure only those in four non-adjacent rectangles.

A distance measurement with FSI is not very sensitive to small transverse displacements of the transverse planes with respect to each other. The longitudinal lines of the type 11' in Fig. 2 should also be measured with a straightness monitor [3] which is sensitive to transverse displacements to better than 1 \(\mu\)m.

Fig. 2 does not show the two additional transverse planes containing only a middle and inner octagon in the two transitions from the barrel part to the end cap parts of the inner detector. Fig 3. shows a side view of the inner detector with the position of these planes. Here, space is very much restricted for implementing longitudinal lines of sight. Space is available along the barrel part, but restricted along the end cap part, in an annular slot at the circumscribed circle of the middle octagon. Also, the volume within the inscribed circle of the inner octagon along the end cap parts can be used.

The two middle octagons on each side of the barrel part can not be connected by longitudinal triangles between the corner points as for the outer octagons in Fig. 2. The short side of a rectangle can subtend at most an arc of \(\pi\)/16 of the circumscribed circle. On four sides these arcs are added and connected longitudinally, as shown in Fig. 4. This layout guarantees the measurement of the relative position of these two octagons.

Figure 2: Three-dimensional alignment grid.

An inner octagon at the end of the inner detector and the adjacent inner octagon at the transition between barrel and end cap are connected in the same way as shown in Fig. 4. This defines the relative position of these two octagons.

The middle octagons at these two positions are only connected by longitudinal lines between the corner points. This requires a minimum space in between the services at the outer radius of the inner detector. The relative position of these octagons should be defined sufficiently by these longitudinal lines, the straightness monitors in the end planes of Fig. 2 and the alignment in Fig. 4. However, it may be necessary to duplicate the longitudinal lines with straightness monitors [3] for monitoring of the transverse displacements of the octagons. These require some, but not much transverse space along straight lines at the radius of the middle octagons.

## 2 Absolute monitor

Absolute monitoring is needed for settling the absolute position of the reference grid and thus of all components with respect to the proton beams or interaction region, and for defining an overall ATLAS coordinate system. Measurement of the interaction point can only be done with tracks for which in principle all charge tracks above a certain momentum can be taken to minimize the uncertainties due to multiple scattering in the components of the inner detector, the calorimeter and the muon spectrometer. This measurement is then only limited by the measurement precision in the inner detector and the muon spectrometer, and the statistics accumulated within a given time period during an LHC fill. Good knowledge of initial alignment constants from the relative monitoring as described in the previous section is crucial.

Figure 3: Longitudinal alignment grid in the inner detector. The heavy vertical lines are the planes of the transverse middle and inner octagons. A heavy horizontal line stands for longitudinal and diagonal lines, a thin line only for longitudinal lines (see text).

Figure 4: Longitudinal alignment grid in the barrel part of the inner detector. The two middle octagons on each side of the barrel; part are connected longitudinally at four sides.

This may be crucial for good knowledge of initial alignment constants for overall track fitting. The absolute alignment between inner detector and muon spectrometer may be improved using Z\({}^{0}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decays. The precision of this method is limited by the measurement accuracy of the muon tracks in the inner detector and the muon spectrometer, the multiple scattering of the decay muons in the calorimeter, and the statistics accumulated within a given time period during an LHC fill..

## 3 Linkage to inner detector alignment

The alignment of the inner detector has been discussed in Ref. [1]. There is no difference for the alignment scheme for the barrel part of the detector in that paper and here. However, the alignment of MSGC wheels, and linked to these that of the TRT wheels might be done with straightness monitors [3] at the radius of the inner octagons.

## 4 Linkage to muon spectrometer alignment

It should not be difficult to link the grid with the straightness monitors of the alignment system of the muon spectrometer [4]. The additional straightness monitors for the transverse displacements might be available already in the muon spectrometer.

## 5 Linkage to external reference points

If needed, it should not be difficult to achieve lines of sight from the alignment grid through the muon spectrometer to fiducial marks in the ATLAS hall for establishing an absolute reference. However, any point in the hall may be subject to the instabilities of the hall itself.

## 6 Conclusion

An attempt is made to design an overall alignment grid for continuous relative and absolute monitoring of all tracking components of the ATLAS detector. The calorimeters can also be linked into this grid.
