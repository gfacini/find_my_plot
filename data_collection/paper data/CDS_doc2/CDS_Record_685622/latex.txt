**High-precision drift tubes**

Walter Blum

When drift tubes are used for high-precision coordinate measurements there are some limitations to the achievable accuracy of an individual tube. In this paper I try to estimate the limits caused by an imperfect geometry of the tube, by an uncertainty in the knowledge of the magnetic field, and by the ionization and diffusion of typical gases, taking into account the gas density.

**1. Electrostatics of perfect and of imperfect drift tubes**

If a 'proportional tube' is used for a coordinate measurement by recording the drift time of ionization electrons to the wire, one has a 'drift tube'. Whether the signal at the wire is created by a proportional avalanche -- as the original name suggests -- or by a self-quenching streamer, the drift velocity and the electric field between the two conductors must be very well known if one wants to exploit the intrinsic accuracy of this device.

Deviations from the ideal geometry of two concentric circular cylinders are caused by displaced wires or deformed walls. In this section we discuss the electric field arising in an eliptical right cylinder and in a hexagonal right cylinder with the wire in the centre, and the field arising in a circular right cylinder with the wire off-centre. Since we are dealing with relatively small deviations our method is a perturbation calculation in the first order of the linear deviation.

A general method of determining the solution of Laplace's equation

\[\nabla^{2}\ \Phi=0\]

for the potential \(\Phi\) in the charge-free space between two conductors is found in my old college book [1]. After separating variables by writing

\[\Phi({\rm r},\varphi,\ {\rm z})={\rm R}({\rm r})\ \phi(\varphi)\ {\rm Z}({\rm z })\,\]

we have in cylindrical coordinates

\[{1\over{\rm r}{\rm R}}{\partial\over\partial{\rm r}}\left({\rm r}{\partial{ \rm R}\over\partial{\rm r}}\right)+{1\over{\rm r}^{2}}{\partial^{2}\phi\over \partial\varphi}^{2}+{1\over{\rm Z}}{\partial^{2}{\rm Z}\over\partial{\rm z}^ {2}}\ =\ 0\]

Assuming \({\rm Z}({\rm z})={\rm const}=1\), the second term is equated to the constant \(-{\rm v}^{2}\) so that

\[{{\rm d}^{\ 2}\phi\over\rm d\varphi}^{2}=-{\rm v}^{\ 2}\phi\]

whose solutions are\[\Phi(\varphi)=C_{\varphi}\,\text{cos}\,\,\nu\varphi+C_{\varphi}\,\text{sin}\,\,\nu\varphi \text{if}\,\,\nu\neq 0 \tag{1.5}\]

or

\[\phi(\varphi)=C_{\varphi}\,\text{'}\,\varphi\,\,+\,\,C_{\varphi}\,\text{if}\,\, \nu=0. \tag{1.6}\]

The radial part becomes the Euler-Cauchy equation

\[\tau\frac{d}{dr}\left(r\frac{dR}{dr}\right)\text{-}\,\text{v}\,^{2}R\,=\,0\,. \tag{1.8}\]

If \(\nu=0\), the solution is given by

\[R(r)\,=\,C_{r}\,\,\,\text{ln}\,r\,+\,C_{r}\,\,. \tag{1.9}\]

### Perfect drift tube

The potential between two coaxial cylinders is a straight application of (1.9). When the outer cylinder (radius b) is on ground and the wire (radius a) on positive potential U, one determines the coefficients to be given by \(C_{\varphi}\,\text{=}\,0\), \(C_{r}\,\text{"}\,\text{=}\,\text{-}\,C_{r}\,\text{ln}\,\,\text{b}\,\,\) and \(C_{r}C_{\varphi}\,\text{ln}\,\,\text{(a/b)}\,\,\text{=}\,\,\text{U}\) so that

\[\phi\,=\frac{U}{\text{ln(a/b)}}\,\text{ln}\left(\frac{r}{b}\right) \tag{1.10}\]

The electric field is directed radially outwards, and

\[E_{r}\,=\,-\frac{\partial\phi}{\partial r}\,=\frac{U}{\text{ln(b/a)}}\frac{1} {r} \tag{1.11}\]

Another way to calculate \(E_{r}\,\)is using Gauss' theorem according to which

\[E_{r}\,=\,\frac{\lambda}{2\pi\,\varepsilon_{0}}\,\frac{1}{r} \tag{1.12}\]

where \(\lambda\) is the linear charge density on the wire; the value of \(\varepsilon_{0}\) is 8.856 x 10\({}^{-12}\,\) As/Vm.

Therefore, the capacitance per unit length of tube is given by \[C=\frac{\lambda}{U}=\frac{2\pi\,\varepsilon_{0}}{\ln(b/a}, \tag{13}\]

### 2 Displaced wire

#### Solution of the electrostatic problem

Let the wire be displaced from the tube centre by the distance d in the negative y-direction (Fig. 1). The wire defines the centre of the coordinate system so that the first boundary condition is

\[\Phi(a)\,=\,U \tag{14}\]

We must express the second boundary by the radius vector as a function of \(\varphi\). The exact expression is

\[\rho\,=\,d\,\sin\varphi+b\sqrt{1\,-\left(d^{2}/b^{2}\right)\left(1\,-\,\sin^{2 }\varphi\right)}\, \tag{15}\]

but we are only interested in small wire displacements. To first order in d/b we have the boundary at \[\rho\ =\ b+d\ sin\ \varphi\, \tag{1.16}\]

and the second boundary condition is

\[\Phi\ (\rho)\ =\ 0. \tag{1.17}\]

Now we must determine the various coefficients using (1.14) and (1.17). To the first order in d/b, we have solutions for \(\nu=0\) and \(\nu=1\), and the most general solution is

\[\Phi\ =\ (C_{\tau}{}^{0^{\ast}}\ln\ r\ +C_{\tau}{}^{0^{\ast}})\ C_{\varphi}{}^{0^{ \ast}}\ +\ (C_{\tau}{}^{1^{\ast}}r\ +\ C_{\tau}{}^{1^{\ast}}/r)\ (C_{\varphi}{}^{1^{\ast}}\cos\ \varphi\ +\ C_{\varphi}{}^{1^{\ast}}\sin\ \varphi) \tag{1.18}\]

Inserting (1.14), we have to require

\[(C_{\tau}{}^{1^{\ast}}a\ +\ C_{\tau}{}^{1^{\ast}}/a)\ =\ 0 \tag{1.19}\]

which implies that \(C_{\tau}{}^{1^{\ast}}\) can be neglected against \(C_{\tau}{}^{1^{\ast}}\) for the entire space except in the immediate vicinity of the wire surface.

When inserting (1.17) and (1.16) into (1.18), we make use of the relation

\[\ln\ (b+d\ sin\ \varphi)\ =\ \ln\ b\ +\ (d/b)\ sin\ \varphi,\]

which holds to first order in d/b. This determines the constants \(C_{\tau}{}^{0^{\ast}}\), \(C_{\tau}{}^{0^{\ast}}\) and \(C_{\varphi}{}^{0^{\ast}}\) as in the case (1.10) of the perfect tube. Comparing factors that multiply the \(\sin\ \varphi\) terms, we find

\[C_{\varphi}{}^{0^{\ast}}C_{\tau}{}^{0^{\ast}}(d/b)\ +\ C_{\tau}{}^{1^{\ast}}b\ C_{ \varphi}{}^{0^{\ast}}=0\]

or

\[C_{\tau}{}^{1^{\ast}}C_{\varphi}{}^{1_{\ast}}=-\frac{d}{b}{}^{2}\frac{U}{\ln( a/b)}, \tag{1.20}\]

whereas \(C_{\varphi}{}^{1^{\ast}}=0\). This produces the solution, in first order of d/b equal to

\[\Phi(r,\varphi)=\frac{U}{\ln\ (a/b)}\ \ln\left(\frac{r}{b}\right)-\frac{U}{\ln \ (a/b)}\frac{d}{b}\frac{r}{b}\sin\ \varphi \tag{1.21}\]

The perturbing potential \(\Phi_{1}\) caused by the wire displacement is given by the second term. Using \(y=r\ sin\ \varphi\), the field perturbation is calculated to be \[\left(E_{1}\right)_{y}=-\frac{\partial\Phi_{1}}{\partial y}=-\frac{U}{ \ln(b/a)}\,\frac{d}{b^{2}}\] \[\left(E_{1}\right)_{x}=\left(E_{1}\right)_{z}=0 \tag{22}\]

It describes a constant field directed towards negative y, whose magnitude is (d/b) times the value of the unperturbed field (11) at the wall.

For the use in Sect. 1.2.3 we also record the value of (E\({}_{1}\))y on the wire surface (r = a). Starting from (19) without the previous simplification C\({}_{t}\)1" = 0, the correct perturbation potential is

\[\Phi_{1}(a)=\frac{U}{\ln\,(a/b)}\,\frac{d}{b^{2}}\left(r-\frac{a^{2}}{r}\right) \,\sin\varphi\ =\ 0\]

the field in y-direction equals

\[\left(E_{1}(a)\right)_{y} = -\frac{\partial\,\Phi_{1}}{\partial\,y}\ \ \ (evaluatedat\,r=a)\] \[= -\frac{U}{\ln\,(b/a)}\,\frac{2d}{b^{2}}\,\sin^{2}\varphi\]

Averaging over \(\varphi\) we have an average extra field on the wire surface equal to

\[<\left(E_{1}(a)\right)>\ =\ -\frac{U}{\ln(b/a)}\,\frac{d}{b^{2}} \tag{23}\]

The average field on the wire surface is as large as the field perturbation (22) throughout the volume.

#### 1.2.2 Gravitational sag

The main reason for wire displacement is the weight of the wire. Even when strung with a pulling force T close to the breaking limit, wires in several metre long tubes will experience a gravitational sag that is large in comparison with the achievable accuracy of drift tubes.

In order to derive a formula for the amount of the bowing we introduce the coordinates y (downwards) and x (horizontal). We note that on every length element dx the weight of the wire is (\(\rho=\) density, Q = cross-sectional area of the wire, g = 981 cm/s\({}^{2}\)). It must be compensated by the vertical component of the tension at this point, which is equal to the difference of the slopes at the two ends of the interval dx, multiplied by the pulling force T:

\[-\mathrm{T}\left[\mathrm{y^{\prime}\left(x+dx\right)-y^{\prime}\left(x\right)}\right] \tag{26}\]

where the primes denote the first derivative. In this approximation we have assumed that the pulling force is the same for all x, the variation due to the weight of the wire being negligible for practical tubes.

Combining (23) and (24), one has the differential equation

\[-\mathrm{y^{\prime\prime}}=\mathrm{C}\mathrm{\ =\ }\rho\mathrm{\ g\ Q\ /\ T} \tag{27}\]

with the solution

\[\mathrm{y}\mathrm{\ =\ }-\left(\mathrm{C}/2\right)\mathrm{x^{2}\ +\ C_{1}\ x\ +\ C_{2}.} \tag{28}\]

Specifying that y = 0 at x = \(\pm\) L/2 determines the coefficients C\({}_{1}\), C\({}_{2}\), and the solution becomes

\[\mathrm{y}\mathrm{\ =\ }\frac{\mathrm{C}}{2}\left(\frac{\mathrm{L}^{2}}{4}- \mathrm{x^{2}}\right) \tag{29}\]

The point of the maximum excursion is the sagitta, equal to

\[\mathrm{s}\mathrm{\ =\ }\mathrm{y}(0)=\frac{\mathrm{C\ L}^{2}}{8}=\frac{\rho \mathrm{\ g\ Q\ L}^{2}}{8\ \mathrm{\bar{T}}}. \tag{30}\]

The ratio T/Q is limited by the material properties of the wire. For example, a 1 m long copper-beryllium wire strung at 500 N/mm\({}^{2}\) -- roughly 50% of the elastic limit of the hard alloy -- will sag by 22 \(\mu\)m.

#### Electrostatic force on the sagged wire

The displacement of the wire creates an average field (24) which acts on the electric charge of the wire and produces a force which tends to increase the displacement.

The differential equation (1.27) needs to be complemented by a term which represents the electrostatic force per unit wire length. This is given by the product

\[\lambda\ <(\mathrm{E}_{1}\left(\mathrm{a}\right))_{y}>\,\]

where \(\lambda\) is given by (1.12) in terms of the unperturbed field, and \(<(\mathrm{E}_{1}\left(\mathrm{a}\right))_{y}>\) is given by (1.24) and is proportional to the displacement \(y\). The electrostatic force, like gravity, points downwards and leads to a positive term on the right-hand side of (1.27), whereas \(y^{*}<0\). Therefore, the differential-equation is

\[y^{*}\ +\ \mathrm{k}^{2}\ y\ +\ \mathrm{C}\ =\ 0 \tag{1.31}\]

with \(\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{pgQ/T}\) and \(\mathrm{k}^{2}=2\pi\ \varepsilon_{0}\ \mathrm{E}_{0}^{2}(\mathrm{b})\ /\ T\). The value of \(\mathrm{k}\) is plotted against \(\mathrm{E}_{0}(\mathrm{b})\) and \(\mathrm{T}\) in Fig. 1.2.

The general solution of (1.31) is

\[y\ =\ \mathrm{C}_{1}\cos\mathrm{kx}\ +\mathrm{C}_{2}\sin\mathrm{kx}\ -\ \mathrm{C/k}^{2} \tag{1.32}\]

When specifying \(y(\pm\mathrm{L/2})=0\), the coefficients \(\mathrm{C}_{1}\), \(\mathrm{C}_{2}\) are determined, and the solution becomes

\[y\ =\ \frac{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{k}^{2}}\ \left(\frac{1}{\cos\left(\mathrm{kL/2 }\right)}\ \cos\mathrm{kx}\ -\ 1\right) \tag{1.33}\]

The electrostatic force has changed the form of the wire from the parabola (1.29) to the cosine function (1.33).

The new sagitta is

\[s_{\mathrm{k}}=y(0)=\frac{\mathrm{C}}{\mathrm{k}^{2}}\ \left(\frac{1}{\cos\left( \mathrm{kL/2}\right)}\ -\ 1\right) \tag{1.34}\]

This means the electrostatic force has increased the sagitta (1.30) by the factor

\[\frac{s_{\mathrm{k}}}{s}=\frac{8}{\mathrm{k}^{2}\,\mathrm{L}^{2}}\ \left(\frac{1}{\cos\left(\mathrm{kL/2}\right)}\ -\ 1\right) \tag{1.35}\]Figure 1.3: **Electrostatic amplification factor of the gravitational sag, as a function of kL, according to (1.35)**

Figure 1.2: **Value of the constant k in (L.31), relevant for the electrostatic amplification of the gravitational sag, as a function of the electric field E\({}_{0}\)(b) at the tube wall, for various wire pulling forces T**

As the product kL approaches the value of \(\pi\), the excursion tends to infinity, and the wire is no longer in a stable position. For example, the gravitational sag of a wire strung with one N inside a 4 m long tube will be amplified by a factor s\({}_{\rm b}\)/s of 1.8 if the field at the wall is E\({}_{0}\)(b) = 500 V/cm, and the point of instability is reached at E\({}_{0}\)(b) = 750 V/cm. In Fig. 3 we plot s\({}_{\rm k}\)/s as a function of kL.

### 1.3 Elliptical wall

Let the wire (radius a) be in the centre of the ellipse with half-axes b in x-direction and c along y. Defining a mean wall radius R

\[{\rm R}\ =\ ({\rm b}\ +{\rm c})\ /\ 2 \tag{36}\]

and the shape parameter \(|\beta|<<1\),

\[\beta\ =\ ({\rm b}\ -{\rm R})\ /\ {\rm R} \tag{37}\]

the tube wall is given to first order in \(\beta\) by the length \(\rho\) of the radius vector as a function of \(\varphi\):

\[\rho\ =\ {\rm R}\ (1+\beta\cos 2\varphi). \tag{38}\]

(Previously R was used (2) to mean a potential function.)

Referring to (5) and (6), we have solutions for v = 0 and v = 2; the most general solution is

\[\Phi\ =\ ({\rm C}_{\rm r}{}^{0^{*}}\ln{\rm r}+{\rm C}_{\rm r}{}^{0^{*}})\ {\rm C}_{\rm q}{}^{0^{*}}\ +\ ({\rm C}_{\rm r}{}^{2^{*}}\,{\rm r}^{2}\ +\ {\rm C}_{\rm r}{}^{2^{*}}\,{\rm/}\ {\rm r}^{2})\ ({\rm C}_{\rm q}{}^{2^{*}}\cos 2 \varphi\ +\ {\rm C}_{\rm\varphi}{}^{2^{*}}\sin 2\varphi) \tag{39}\]

The two boundary conditions are

\[\Phi\ ({\rm a})\ =\ {\rm U} \tag{40}\]

and \[\Phi\ (\rho)\ =\ 0\ {\rm, independent\ of\ \varphi}\] (41)

From (40) we conclude

\[({\rm C}_{\rm r}{}^{2^{*}}\,{\rm a}^{2}\ +\ {\rm C}_{\rm r}{}^{2^{*}}\,{\rm/ }\,{\rm a}^{2})\ =\ 0 \tag{42}\]

Figure 1.5: Approximation of the hexagon by (1.54)

\[\rho^{*}\,=\,R\,(1\,-\,\epsilon\,\cos\,6\varphi). \tag{1.54}\]

This approximation of the hexagon is illustrated in Fig. 1.5. The most general solution contains the sixth power of the radius and is given by

\[\Phi\,=\,(C_{\rm r}\rho^{0^{*}}\ln\tau+C_{\rm r}\rho^{0^{*}})\,C_{\rm q}\rho^{0^ {*}}\,+\,(C_{\rm r}\rho^{6^{*}}\,+\,C_{\rm r}\rho^{6^{*}}/\,r^{6})\,(C_{\rm q} \rho^{6^{*}}\cos\,6\varphi\,+\,C_{\rm q}\rho^{6^{*}}\cos\,6\varphi)\]

The two boundary conditions are

\[\Phi(a)\,=\,U \tag{1.56}\]

\[\Phi(\rho^{*})\,=\,0 \tag{1.57}\]

Going through the same steps as before yields

\[\Phi\,=\,\Phi_{0}\,+\,\Phi_{6}=\frac{U}{\ln\,(a/R)}\,\ln\left(\frac{r}{R} \right)-\frac{U}{\ln\,(a/R)}\,\epsilon\,\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^{6}\,\cos\,6\varphi \tag{1.58}\]

The potential \(\Phi_{6}\) describes the difference of the field configurations of the hexagonal and the circular cylindrical tubes. The field \({\bf E}_{6}\) has the following radial and tangential components:

\[\left[{\bf E}_{6}\right]_{\rm r}=-\frac{\partial\,\Phi_{6}}{\partial\,\tau}= \frac{U}{\ln\,(a/R)}\,\frac{6\epsilon}{R}\,\left(\frac{r}{R}\right)^{5}\cos \,6\varphi \tag{1.59}\]

\[\left[{\bf E}_{6}\right]_{\varphi}=-\frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial\,\Phi_{6}}{ \partial\,\varphi}=-\frac{U}{\ln\,(a/R)}\,\frac{6\epsilon}{R}\,\left(\frac{r }{R}\right)^{5}\sin\,6\varphi \tag{1.60}\]

We note that the magnitude of this high-multipole field is independent of \(\varphi\); in comparison with the field at the wall of the perfect tube, it is smaller by the factor

\[\frac{\left|{\bf E}_{6}(r\right|}{\bf E}_{0}(R)\,\,=\,\,6\epsilon\left(\frac {r}{R}\right)^{5} \tag{1.61}\]

As one goes around, varying \(\varphi\) at constant \(r\), the field \({\bf E}_{6}\) changes its direction and goes through six full revolutions as the wire is surrounded once (Figs. 1.6, 1.7).

## 2 Choice of the gas and of the drift field under practical conditions

### Parametrization of the drift velocity

Being proportional to 1/r, the drift field E in a tube is quite inhomogeneous, and for the drift behaviour of the gas in the tube we must consider the variation of the drift velocity u with E. Drift gases exhibit a broad variety of behaviours, and in the end a given gas must be studied on the basis of its measured function u(E).

In order to obtain an overview about possible choices of a gas in the region of low values of E, we describe a typical u(E) by two parameters as rising from zero with mobility u, then remaining constant at u\({}_{0}\).

\[\begin{array}{cccc}&\mu\;\mbox{E}&&\;\mbox{E}<\mbox{E}_{0}\\ \mbox{u(E)}\;=&&\\ &\;\mbox{u}_{0}&&\;\mbox{E}>\mbox{E}_{0}\end{array} \tag{1}\]

The field E\({}_{0}\) is given by u E\({}_{0}\) = u\({}_{0}\). Let E\({}_{0}\) be reached at radius r\({}_{0}\). The field E\({}_{b}\) at the wall is related to r\({}_{0}\) by

\[\mbox{r}_{0}=\mu\;\mbox{E}_{b}\;\mbox{b}\;/\;\mbox{u}_{0} \tag{2}\]

where b is the inner tube radius. The variation of u inside the tube is shown in Fig. 1.

### Drift space-time relation

The drift time from any point r to the origin is

\[\int_{0}^{t}\!\!\frac{dr}{u_{0}}=\frac{r}{u_{0}}\] ( r \[\leq r_{0}\] )

\[\mbox{T(r)}=\] (3) \[\int_{0}^{t}\!\!\frac{dr}{u_{0}}+\int_{t_{0}}^{t}\!\!\frac{r\,dr}{ u_{0}}=\frac{r_{0}}{2u_{0}}+\frac{r^{2}}{2u_{0}r_{0}}\] ( r \[\geq r_{0}\] )Figure 2.3: Maximum drift, expressed in units of b/u\({}_{\rm{p}}\), as a function of the \(\rho\)-parameter, according to (4)

Figure 2.1: Drift velocity plotted against the electric field E and against the tube radius r, according to the parametrisation (1)

It begins with a part linear in r and continues with a quadratic term, see Fig. 2.2. The maximum drift time T(b) depends on the ratio \(\rho=r_{0}/b\); for the case that is of practical importance (\(r_{0}\leq b\)), it takes the form

\[T(b)=\frac{r_{0}}{2u_{0}}+\frac{b^{2}}{2u_{0}r_{0}}=\frac{b}{u_{0}}\left(\frac{ \rho}{2}+\frac{1}{2\rho}\right) \tag{4}\]

This function is depicted in Fig. 2.3. We observe T(b) to remain almost constant as \(\rho\) is decreased from 1 to 0.5, but it quickly rises as \(\rho\) is decreased further. For example, T(b) = 2.1 b/u\({}_{0}\) at \(\rho=0.25\).

A small value of \(\rho=r_{0}/b\) also leads to the unfavourable situation that the drift velocity at the wall of the tube is smaller than it is near the wire by the factor

\[\frac{u_{min}}{u_{max}}=\frac{r_{0}}{b} \tag{5}\]

### Influence of a magnetic field parallel to the wire on the electron drift

With a magnetic field B parallel to the wire, the electrons do not travel on radial approach lines towards the wire, but under an angle \(\psi\) which is roughly given by

\[\tan\psi=\omega\tau \tag{6}\]

where \(\omega=e/m\) B is the electron cyclotron frequency and \(\tau\) is the mean time between collisions of the electrons with the gas molecules. To a good approximation \(\omega\tau\) can be calculated using the electron mobility

\[\mu=\frac{e}{m}\tau\,, \tag{8}\]

which results in

\[\omega\tau=\mu\,B. \tag{9}\]The change in the drift direction makes the electron approach the wire on a curve which is illustrated for three different constant values of \(\omega\tau\) in Fig. 2.4. The factor by which the curve is longer than the corresponding straight line is obviously equal to

\[\frac{1}{\cos\psi}=\text{factorof elongation} \tag{2.10}\]

When the magnetic field is switched on, the electrons will also have the magnitude of their drift velocity changed from u(E,0) to u(E,B). It is not easy to calculate u(E,B) for the general case, but for the simplification (2.1), progress is possible using Tonks' theorem [2]. It states that the drift velocity will remain the same when switching on B, provided E is changed from E\({}_{1}\) to E\({}_{2}\):

\[\text{u(E}_{1},0)=\text{u(E}_{2},\text{B)}, \tag{2.11}\]

where

\[\text{E}_{2}=\text{E}_{1}/\cos\psi \tag{2.12}\]

Using (2.1), this implies a reduction of the mobility by the factor \(\cos\psi\) in the outer drift region, and no change in the inner one. (There is also a slight change in r\({}_{0}\).)

\[\mu\text{(B=0)}\text{ }\cos\psi\text{ E }\text{r}\geq\text{r}_{0} \tag{2.13}\]

u(E,B) =

u\({}_{0}\)

r\(\leq\text{r}_{0}\)

### Limits on drift parameters resulting from an uncertainty in the knowledge of the magnetic field

Although we deal with coordinate measurements and their achievable accuracy only in Sect. 3, we single out one particular source of error to be treated here under the aspect of the choice of the drift parameters. If the magnetic field exhibits some inhomogeneity it may happen that its value at some particular point is only known inside some latitude \(\Delta\)B. The effects described in Sect. 2.3 then lead to an uncertainty in the arrival time and hence in the measured coordinate. This uncertainty may become large for small values of \(\cos\psi\). Therefore, there is a necessity to restrict the value of \(\psi\) by a proper choice of drift parameters.

In the regime of constant mobility (\(r\geq r_{0}\)) the drift time is stretched by the constant factor 1/\(\cos^{2}\psi\), in the regime of constant velocity (\(r\leq r_{0}\)) the time is stretched by the variable factor 1/\(\cos\psi\) whose dependence on the radius is given by

\[\cos^{2}\psi\ =\ 1\ /\ (1+\omega^{2}+\epsilon^{2}) \tag{14}\]

and

\[\omega\tau(r)=\ B\ \mu(r)=\ B\ \frac{u_{0}}{E(r)}=\frac{Bu_{0}r}{E_{b}b}\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (r\leq r_{0}) \tag{15}\]

An uncertainty in the knowledge of \(\omega\) results in an error \(\Delta r\) in the coordinate. We will limit ourselves to an estimate of \(\Delta r\) in the outer region. Since the coordinate is stretched by a constant factor 1/\(\cos^{2}\psi\), we have

\[\left\{r\ \mbox{-}\ r_{0}\right\}=\left\{r\ \mbox{-}\ r_{0}\right\}/\cos^{2} \psi=\left[r-r_{0}\right]\left(1+\omega^{2}\tau_{0}^{2}\right) \tag{16}\]

\[\Delta r\ =\ \omega\frac{dr^{\prime}}{d\omega}\frac{\Delta\omega}{\omega} =\ 2\left\{r\ \mbox{-}\ r_{0}\right\}\omega^{2}\tau_{0}^{2}\frac{\Delta\omega}{ \omega}=2\left\{r\ \mbox{-}\ r_{0}\right\}\omega^{2}\tau_{0}^{2}\frac{\Delta B}{B} \tag{17}\]

Here we have neglected the change in \(r_{0}\) due to the B-field.

Since the r.m.s. average of (r-r\({}_{0}\)) for r between \(r_{0}\) and b is (1/\(\sqrt{3}\)) (b-r\({}_{0}\)), we find

\[\left\{\Delta r\right\}_{rms}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\ \omega^{2}\tau_{0}^{2}( b\ \mbox{-}\ r_{0})\frac{\Delta B}{B} \tag{18}\]The smaller part of \(\Delta r\) which arises in the region \(r\leq r_{0}\) can be worked out using (2.15), and can be added to (2.18). For the practical purpose of establishing a limit on the drift parameters, we work with the slightly conservative but simpler relation

\[\frac{\left(\Delta\eta\right)_{\text{rms}}}{\text{b}}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}\ \omega\ ^{2}\ \tau_{0}^{2}\ \frac{\Delta\text{B}}{\text{B}} \tag{2.19}\]

It implies that the Lorentz angle (c.f. (2.6)) should not exceed a value \(\psi_{\text{max}}\) which is given by the relative uncertainty \(\Delta\text{B/B}\) in the knowledge of the magnetic field and the allowed coordinate measuring error \(\Delta r\). This also defines, via the relation (2.9), an upper limit for the electron mobility \(\mu\). The upper limit \(\mu_{\text{max}}\) on the mobility imposed by (2.19) and (2.9) is

\[\mu_{\text{max}}=\sqrt{\frac{\sqrt{3\left(\Delta r\right)_{\text{rms}}/\text{ b}}}{2\ \Delta\text{B}/\text{B}}}\ \ \ \frac{1}{\text{B}} \tag{2.20}\]

Using a numerical example relevant for the ATLAS air core toroid, we estimate for a maximum allowed relative error of this kind of \(\Delta r/\text{b}=15\ \mu\)m / 15 mm, and a typical field of \(\text{B}=1\ \text{T}\), the limits quoted in Table 2.1.

**2.5 Summary -- the difficulty of making the drift velocity high and uniform**

A high drift velocity over the largest possible range of radii is desirable because it makes the maximum drift time shorter, the drift space-time relation more linear, and the measured coordinate less dependent on variations of field or gas density. Assuming a general behaviour of the drift velocity as in Fig. 2.1, this implies one should choose a high electron mobility \(\mu\) and/or a high field E. However, the value of \(\mu\) is limited by the size of the admissible

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l l l l} \(\Delta\text{B}/\text{B}\) & \(\sigma\tau_{0}\) & \(\psi_{\text{max}}\) (deg) & \(\mu\) [cm\({}^{2}\)/(\(\mu\)s kV)] \\ \hline
0.10 & 0.09 & 5.3 & 0.9 \\
0.05 & 0.13 & 7.4 & 1.3 \\
0.02 & 0.21 & 12 & 2.1 \\
0.01 & 0.29 & 16 & 2.9 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

If one fixes some admissable value of \(\mu_{\max}\), one is then led to fix the value of \(\rho\) next, see (2.4, 2.5). This leads to a value of the E field at the tube wall that is equal to

\[E_{b}=\frac{u_{0}\rho}{\mu_{\max}} \tag{2.21}\]

For example, \(E_{0}\) has to be as high as 1.2 kV/cm for \(\mu_{\max}=2.1\) cm\({}^{2}\) / (\(\mu_{\rm s}\) kV), \(u_{0}=5\) cm/\(\mu_{\rm s}\) and \(\rho=0.5\).

Such a high field at the tube wall is not practical for tubes with a radius of one or several cm because it requires too high wire potentials. For details, see [6]. In order to reach more practical values of \(E_{b}\), say 0.4 or 0.6 kV/cm, the product \(u_{0}\rho\) must be reduced correspondingly. Therefore, the drift velocity cannot be simultaneously high and uniform.

## 3 Coordinate measurement using the drift time, and limitations of the accuracy

### Ionization distribution at the wire

The simple wire at the centre of a tube detects all the ionization of a track across the tube. After the passage of the particle, some time elapses until the first ionization electron arrives, the last electrons come in the maximum drift time T(b) (c.f. Sect. 2.1) after the moment of the particle passage. The distribution of arrival times t exhibits a characteristic front, which is originally infinitely sharp, followed by a gradual transition into the constant rate of arrival of the distant ionization. The first question of interest is how well this front is defined, given the fact that the ionization happens in discrete clusters of variable size and also that the electrons on their way to the wire are subject to diffusion.

Referring to Fig. 3.1, the average rate of arrival at the wire is given by the product of the ionization density \(\eta=\mbox{dN/dy}\) along the track, the derivative of the track coordinate with respect to the radius, and the drift velocity \(\mbox{dr/dt}\) which in turn is a function of t:

\[\frac{\mbox{d}\,\mbox{N}}{\mbox{d}\,\mbox{t}}=\eta\ \frac{\mbox{d}\,\mbox{y}}{ \mbox{d}\,\mbox{r}}\frac{\mbox{d}\,\mbox{r}}{\mbox{d}\,\mbox{t}} \tag{3.1}\]

However, it is simpler to describe the process as a function of r rather than of t -- one avoids the use of the time-dependent drift velocity. Therefore we discuss the behaviour of the average 'radial ionization distribution'

Figure 3.1: Geometry of a track traversing the circular tube\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\,\mathrm{N}}{\mathrm{d}\,\mathrm{r}}\,=\,\eta\,\,\frac{\mathrm{d}\, \mathrm{y}}{\mathrm{d}\,\mathrm{r}}\,=\,\eta\,\,\frac{\mathrm{r}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{ r}^{2}+\mathrm{x}^{2}}}\,. \tag{3.2}\]

In Fig. 3.2 we plot this distribution for five tracks located at various x.

The asymptotic value \(\eta\) at large r depends on the gas and its pressure; for example, \(\eta_{\mathrm{p}}\) is about 42 primary clusters per cm in argon at NTP for extremely relativistic muons. This value is based on the measurement of \(27.8\pm 0.3\)[3] in the minimum of the ionization curve, times a factor of about 1.5 from the relativistic rise as measured by Lehraus for the total ionization.The relativistic rise of the primary ionization in argon has not been measured, to our knowledge. The total ionization is, roughly speaking, three times larger: \(\eta_{\mathrm{t}}\,=\,3\,\,\eta_{\mathrm{p}}\). The expressions (3.1) and (3.2) may refer to either \(\eta_{\mathrm{p}}\) or \(\eta_{\mathrm{t}}\). \(\eta_{\mathrm{p}}\) is proportional to the gas pressure.

### 3.2 Fluctuation of the arrival position -- primary ionization

One way to visualize the influence of the primary ionization density on the accuracy of the front is to ask at what average distance \(\Delta\mathrm{r}\) behind the front one expects the first primary cluster. With reference to Fig. 3.1, the k-th cluster is expected, on average, within the interval

\[\Delta\mathrm{r}\,=\,\sqrt{\mathrm{x}^{2}+\left(\frac{\mathrm{k}}{2\,\eta_{ \mathrm{p}}}\right)^{2}}\,\,\,-\,\mathrm{x} \tag{3.3}\]

where k / \(\eta_{\mathrm{p}}\) is the average track length for k clusters. The curves of Fig. 3.3 show \(\Delta\mathrm{r}\) for various k, calculated for argon at NTP as a function of x. As it turns out, the front is very well defined -- for a track at \(\mathrm{x}\,=\,1\,\,\mathrm{mm}\) the first cluster comes within 7 \(\mu\)m, the second within 28, the third within 62 \(\mu\)m behind the front. In conclusion, the primary ionization in argon at NTP is dense enough for accuracies well below 100 \(\mu\)m -- provided there is sensitivity to the first very few clusters. At higher thresholds the region of reduced accuracy near the wire will extend.

Figure 3.2: Radial distribution of ionization according to (3.2), for five tracks at 0.5, 1.5,3,5, and 10 mm distance from the wire

### 3.3 Fluctuation of the arrival position -- diffusion

The other mechanism to smear out the front of arriving electrons is their diffusion. An analytic description of this smearing process does not exist, and one must involve a numerical simulation. We must take account of the fact that electrons are created in clusters, each electron diffusing independently on its way to the wire.

### 3.31 Cluster size distribution

The number n\({}_{\rm clus}\) of electrons created in each primary cluster follows a distribution first calculated by Lapique and Piuz [4]. Their curve was complemented for this paper towards larger n\({}_{\rm clus}\), following [5]. The resulting integral distribution is depicted in Fig. 3.4. It is worth noting that very large clusters may occur at low rates -- for example, it is 2% probable to exceed 20 electrons. The exact shape of the distribution is not essential for our purpose.

#### 3.3.2 Behaviour of the diffusion

Since the diffusion constant is a function of the electric field the contribution to the width of the single-electron diffusion will be different for every radius. Our interest here is a basic exploration of the statistical factor in the smearing of the electron front, therefore we will characterize the degree of diffusion by a single effective number, \(\sigma_{1}\), defined to be the rms width of a single-electron diffusion over 1 cm at NTP of the respective gas mixture. The diffusion of an electron created at some radius r\({}_{\rm i}\) and arriving at the wire is accounted for by a random radial shift \(\Delta\)r according to a Gaussian distribution

\[\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\ \sigma_{\rm(i)}}\ \exp\ -\frac{\left(\Delta\right)^{2}}{ \sigma_{\rm(i)}} \tag{3.4}\]

with

\[\sigma_{\rm(i)}=\sigma_{1}\ \sqrt{\frac{\rm r_{i}}{1\ {\rm cm}}}\ \ \sqrt{\frac{1\ {\rm bar}}{{\rm p}}} \tag{3.5}\]

where p is the gas pressure.

Figure 3.6: **Tube-averaged track measuring accuracy (r.m.s) as a function of the gas pressure, calculated for k = 1 and k = 10;** (a)–(d): four differentvalues of the diffusion quantity \(\sigma_{1}\)

In order to arrive at a figure of merit for the full tube the above variances must be averaged over all radii (see also Sect. 3.6). In our example we chose tubes with a diameter of 3 cm. The resulting r.m.s. single track tube accuracy is called \(<\sigma_{k}>\) and is plotted in Fig. 3.6 a as a function of the gas pressure. Analogous curves (Figs. 3.6 b-d) were computed for three other values of diffusion, corresponding to a range of typical gases. One observes the accuracy at low pressures to be better for k=1 than it is for k=10, whereas for high pressures the situation is reversed. The cross-over point moves to higher pressures as the importance of diffusion is diminished.

In summary, within the ranges of diffusion and of threshold studied here we may expect to reach a measurement accuracy better than 50 \(\mu\)m with gas pressures up to a few bar. The curves in Figs. 3.6 b and c gave rise to a more detailed investigation of argon-carbon-dioxide gas mixtures [6]; providing a first definition of the operating point of the ATLAS prototypes.

Uncertainty in the coordinate measurement caused by variations in the electrostatic boundary conditions

It was shown in Sect. 1 that the displaced wire as well as the elliptically and hexagonally deformed tubes cause certain field distortions. These are relevant for coordinate measurements using the drift time, as long as the drift velocity varies with the field. In drift tubes with their characteristic, large variation of field strength over the drift volume, the drift velocity near the wall is usually proportional to the field strength

\[u\,=\,\mu\,E, \tag{3.6}\]

where \(\mu\) is the constant mobility. Near the wire, the drift velocity usually varies less with E, but the region of approximately constant \(\mu\) extends over most of the drift space.

When existing geometrical deformations are ignored there will be an error in the coordinate measurement. We want to compute the shift \(\Delta r\) introduced by each of these field distortions; its value generally depends on the track direction relative to the field distortions. In each case we will select the direction \(\widehat{y}\) with the largest shift. We also treat the worst case of the drift-velocity field relation by using (3.6) for all radii.

#### 3.4.1 Displaced wire

The disturbing field \(E_{1y}\), in the direction \(\widehat{y}\) by which the tube centre has been separated from the wire, is, according to (1.22), equal to

\[E_{1y}=-\frac{U}{\ln(b/a)}\frac{d}{b^{2}}=-\frac{d}{b}E_{t} \tag{3.7}\]

in first order of d/b, the ratio of the wire displacement to the tube radius. \(E_{b}\) is the magnitude of the unperturbed field at the wall.

The drift time measured for a track across the tube will be unaffected by the wire displacement only if the track is oriented along \(\widehat{y}\) so that the nearest electrons travel along \(\widehat{x}\). The largest effect occurs for electron drift along \(\widehat{y}\), i.e. the track oriented along \(\widehat{x}\); for this case we want to compute the apparent track shift \(\Delta y\).

The measured drift time T is given by the integral over the inverse drift velocity \(u\), where

\[\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{\mu\,E}=\frac{1}{\mu\,(E_{0}+E_{1})}\]

\[=\frac{1}{\mu\,E_{b}\frac{b}{r}\left(1+\frac{d\,r}{b^{2}}\right)}=\frac{r}{\mu \,E_{b}b}\left(1-\frac{d\,r}{b^{2}}\right) \tag{3.8}\]

to first order in d/b. Therefore,

\[T=\int_{0}^{r}\frac{r}{\mu\,E_{b}b}\,dr\;\;-\;\int_{0}^{r}\frac{r^{2}d}{\mu\, E_{b}b^{3}}\,dr\;\;=T_{0}+\Delta T \tag{3.9}\]

The time shift caused by the wire displacement amounts to

\[\left|\Delta T\right|=\frac{dr^{3}}{3\,\mu\,E_{b}b^{3}}\;, \tag{3.10}\]

and the corresponding coordinate shift is given by\[\Delta y=u\;\Delta T=\;\mu\;E_{b}\frac{b}{r}\frac{d\;r^{3}}{\mu\;E_{b}b^{3}}=\frac{d }{3}\frac{r^{2}}{b^{2}} \tag{3.11}\]

to first order in d/b. Near the wall, the coordinate shift is one third of the wire displacement, for smaller r it quickly decreases. \(\Delta y\) has the same sign on both sides of the wire, i.e. the track coordinate is displaced in the same direction in which the tube centre has been separated from the wire.

In order to compute the r.m.s. average over many parallel tracks traversing the tube, we replace r by y and let y/b vary between \(-1\) and \(+1\). The average and the variance of the displacement are

\[<\Delta y>\;=\;d/9\;\;\;\mbox{and}\]

\[\left[\left(\Delta y\right)^{2}\right]=\;\zeta\left(\Delta y\right)^{2}>\;-\;< \Delta y>^{2}\;=\;d^{2}45-d^{2}/81 \tag{3.12}\]

The r.m.s. error is

\[\left(\Delta y\right)_{rms}\;=\;0.10\;d. \tag{3.13}\]

#### 3.4.2 Elliptical wall

This case is governed by the small parameter \(\beta\), where the ratio of the largest to the average tube radii is \(1+\beta\); the ratio of the largest to the smallest tube diameters is then \(1+4\beta\).

The perturbing quadrupole field has the largest influence for tracks parallel to one of the principal axes of the ellipse. For a track parallel to the \(\widehat{x}\) direction the drift of the nearest electrons is along \(\widehat{y}\), and the relevant field component, according to (1.48), is

\[E_{2y}=\;\beta\frac{U}{\mbox{ln (R/a)}}\frac{2y}{R^{2}}=E_{R}\;\beta\frac{2y}{R} \tag{3.14}\]

to first order in \(\beta\). Here \(E_{R}\) designates the (unperturbed) field at the tube wall.

The inverse of the drift velocity along \(\widehat{y}\) takes, in first order of \(\beta\), the form

\[\frac{1}{u}=\frac{1}{\mu E}=\frac{1}{\mu\;(E_{0}+E_{2})}\]\[=\frac{1}{\mu\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{R}}\frac{\mathrm{R}}{\mathrm{y}}\left(1+\beta \frac{2\mathrm{y}^{2}}{\mathrm{R}^{2}}\right)}\,=\,\frac{\mathrm{y}}{\mu\mathrm{ E}_{\mathrm{R}}\mathrm{R}}\left(1-2\beta\frac{\mathrm{y}^{2}}{\mathrm{R}^{2}}\right) \tag{3.15}\]

The time shift caused by the deformation is, analogously to (3.10),

\[\Delta\mathrm{T}\,=\,-2\beta\,\frac{1}{\mu\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{R}}\,\mathrm{R} }\,\frac{\mathrm{y}^{4}}{4\mathrm{R}^{3}} \tag{3.16}\]

The corresponding coordinate shift is

\[\Delta\mathrm{y}\,=\,\left|\mathrm{u}\right|\left|\Delta\mathrm{T}\right|\,=\, \mu\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{R}}\frac{\mathrm{R}}{\mathrm{y}}\,\frac{\mathrm{B}}{2} \,\frac{1}{\mu\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{R}}}\frac{\mathrm{y}^{4}}{\mathrm{R}^{3}}= \frac{\mathrm{\beta}}{2}\,\frac{\mathrm{y}^{3}}{\mathrm{R}^{2}}\,\,\,, \tag{3.17}\]

this shift changes sign at the wire. The average and the variance of the displacement are

\[<\Delta\mathrm{y}>\,=\,0\]

\[\left[\left(\Delta\mathrm{y}\right)^{2}\right]=\zeta\left(\Delta\mathrm{y} \right)^{2}>\,=\,\frac{\left(\beta\mathrm{R}\right)^{2}}{28}\]

The r.m.s. error is

\[\left(\,\Delta\mathrm{y}\,\right)_{\mathrm{ms}}\,=\,0.19\,\,\,\beta\mathrm{R}. \tag{3.18}\]

For example, an elliptical tube having a difference between largest and smallest diameters of 100 \(\mu\)m will cause an r.m.s. measuring error of 5 \(\mu\)m. Tracks that are not parallel to one of the axes of the ellipse suffer even less.

#### 3.4.3 Hexagonal wall

Let the hexagon be oriented with the largest diameter along \(\widehat{\mathrm{x}}\) and the smallest along \(\widehat{\mathrm{y}}\). The tracks oriented along \(\widehat{\mathrm{x}}\) (\(\phi=0^{\circ}\)), \(\phi=60^{\circ}\) and \(120^{\circ}\) will be pulled towards the wire by a shift \(\Delta\mathrm{y}\), and the tracks oriented at \(\phi=30^{\circ}\), \(90^{\circ}\) and \(150^{\circ}\) will be pushed away from the wire by the same amount. In between, the tracks along \(\phi=15^{\circ}\), \(45^{\circ}\), \(75^{\circ}\), \(105^{\circ}\), \(135^{\circ}\) and \(165^{\circ}\) will not be shifted. It is our task to compute \(\Delta\mathrm{y}\) as a function of \(\varepsilon\), compare (1.50).

The disturbing field component, according to (1.59), and using \(\phi=90^{\circ}\), is, in first order of \(\epsilon\)

\[\begin{split}\text{E}_{2y}=\frac{\text{U}}{\text{ln (R/a)}}\frac{6\epsilon}{\text{R}}\left(\frac{y}{\text{R}}\right)^{5}=\,6\epsilon \,\text{E}_{\text{R}}\left(\frac{y}{\text{R}}\right)^{5}\qquad\left(y>0\right) \end{split} \tag{3.19}\]

\(\text{E}_{\text{R}}\) is again the magnitude of the unperturbed field at the wall (this quantity was also called \(|\text{E}_{0}(\text{R})|\) before). The disturbing field quickly reduces with \(\tau\).

The inverse of the drift velocity along \(\widehat{y}\) now takes the form

\[\begin{split}\frac{1}{\text{u}}\,=\frac{1}{\mu\left(\,\text{E}_ {0}+\text{E}_{6}\right)}=\frac{1}{\mu\text{E}\frac{\text{R}}{\text{y}}\left(1+ 6\epsilon\left(\frac{y}{\text{R}}\right)^{\phi}\right)}=\frac{y}{\mu\text{E}_ {\text{R}}}\left(1-6\epsilon\left(\frac{y}{\text{R}}\right)^{\phi}\right) \end{split} \tag{3.20}\]

The time shift caused by the hexagonal shape is, analogously to (3.10),

\[\begin{split}\Delta\text{T}=-\frac{6\epsilon}{\mu\text{E}_{ \text{R}}}\int_{0}^{y}\frac{y}{R^{7}}dy\,=\,-\,\frac{6\epsilon}{\mu\text{E}_{ \text{R}}}\frac{y^{8}}{8R^{7}}\end{split} \tag{3.21}\]

The corresponding shift in space equals

\[\begin{split}\Delta y\,=\left|\text{u}\right|\left|\Delta\text{ T}\right|=\frac{6}{8}\epsilon\text{R}\left(\frac{y}{\text{R}}\right)^{7} \end{split} \tag{3.22}\]

This shift also changes sign at the wire. The average and the variance are

\[\begin{split}<\Delta y>\,=\,0\\ \left[\left(\Delta y\right)^{2}\right]=\left(\frac{6}{8}\, \epsilon R\right)^{2}\frac{1}{15}\end{split} \tag{3.23}\]

The r.m.s. error is

\[\left(\,\Delta y\,\right)_{\text{rms}}\,=\,0.2\,\,\epsilon R \tag{3.24}\]It should be noted that this result is not very accurate, for two reasons. The large size of the distortion makes the neglected second-order terms quite large -- for example in (3.20) the neglected terms are of order \((6\epsilon)^{2}\ =0.1\), or 30% of the retained first order terms. But also the very values of \(\epsilon\) and \(\delta\) (see (1.50)), computed for a geometrical hexagon, are in doubt for a thin plastic foil, and are sensitive to the production process as well as to the gas pressure.

Applying (3.24) to the example of R = 1.5 cm, we obtain an error of approximately \(\pm 150\)\(\mu\)m. There is a possibility of reducing the error by sacrificing some sensitive space near the wall. Let \(\eta=y_{\rm cutoff}\) / R define a cut-off parameter. By restricting the calculation of (3.24) to values \(y\ <\ y_{\rm cutoff}\) we find

\[\left(\ \Delta y\ {\rm restricted}\right)_{\rm rms}\ =\ 0.2\ {\rm eR}\ \eta^{7.5} \tag{3.25}\]

For example, a reduction by a factor of 3 is obtained by cutting at \(\eta=0.86\). It should be stressed that the effective radius must still be stable and well known.

### Uncertainty in the coordinate measurement caused by variations in the gas density

It is characteristic of drift tubes that the drift velocity u varies with the gas density \(\rho\) over a good part of the radius. This is due to the fact that the dependence of u on \(\rho\) and on the electric field E is through the ratio E/\(\rho\). At a fixed wire potential a variation \(\Delta\rho\) changes the ratio E/\(\rho\) and with it, usually, the drift velocity. In the region near the tube wall where E is small and the electron mobility \(\mu\) approximately independent of E we can calculate how u varies with \(\rho\). Looking at Fig. 3.7 we observe that u(\(\rho\),E) is completely determined in the domain of

Figure 3.7: Plane of the two variables E and \(\rho\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:41]

### Note on averaging the accuracy over the tube

The measurement accuracy of a track varies as a function of the distance x to the wire. When computing 'the measurement accuracy of a tube' there has to be some averaging over x. There are several possibilities, depending on how one wants to determine the track parameters.

The usual situation is such that n tubes are grouped together and a track coordinate x is determined from the few coordinates xi (i = 1, 2,.. n) measured in the tubes of each group.

The first possibility is to take the simple average

\[x\ =\frac{1}{n}\ \sum x_{i}. \tag{3.30}\]

If no further information about the relative positions of the tubes or the orientation of the track is given, we should assume that (A) all parts of the drift space are equally probable, and that (B) the x\({}_{i}\) are uncorrelated. These assumptions are appropriate for the early planning stage of an experiment: each tube is characterized by an average accuracy \(\sigma_{i}^{\bullet}\), and a group of n identical tubes yields the accuracy

\[\sigma_{\rm group}=\sigma_{i}^{\bullet}\ /\sqrt{n}\ . \tag{3.31}\]

In order to compute the \(\sigma_{i}^{\bullet}\) we evaluate the variance [xx] of (3.30) using the fact that all the x\({}_{i}\) have the same expectation value \(<x_{i}>\).

\[[xx]\ =\ <x^{2}>\ -\ <x>^{2}\ =\ (\ <(x_{1}+x_{2}+..\ )^{2}>\ -\ <x_{1}+x_{2}+..\ >^{2}\ )\ /\ n^{2}\]

\[[xx]\ =\ (\ <x_{i}^{2}>\ -\ <x_{i}>^{2})\ /\ n \tag{3.32}\]

because, according to assumption (B), \(<x_{1}x_{2}>\ =\ <x_{1}>\ <x_{2}>\ \) etc.. Identifying (3.32) with the square of (3.31), we have

\[\sigma_{i}^{\bullet 2}\ =\ <x_{i}^{2}>\ -\ <x_{i}>^{2}. \tag{3.33}\]

The averaging, denoted by brackets \(<>\), is over all the tubes and all the tracks in a given sample of track measurements. Under the assumption (A) this is identical to the average over the drift space, in particular\[\sigma_{i}^{\ 2}=\ <x_{i}^{\ 2}>\ -\ <x_{i}>^{\ 2}=\frac{1}{2R}\ \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \sigma_{i}^{\ 2}\left(x\right)\ dx\ . \tag{3.34}\]

A second possibility is, to improve on (1) by taking

\[x\ =\frac{1}{n}\ \sum W_{i}x_{i}. \tag{3.35}\]

with

\[W_{i}=\frac{1\ /\ \sigma_{i}^{\ 2}}{\sum 1\ /\ \sigma_{i}^{\ 2}}\.\]

The use of (3.35) in place of (3.30) promises increased track accuracy if large variations of \(\sigma_{i}(x)\) are present -- the one tube of the group in which the track happens to pass through a region of \(x\) where \(\sigma_{i}(x)\) is particularly small, will determine the track coordinate of the group almost alone. To evaluate the effect one must obviously know the correlations \(<W_{i}x_{i}\ W_{j}x_{j}>\) which depend on the track angle and the geometrical staggering of the tubes. The study of this refined error propagation seems to be more appropriate for a later stage of the experiment.
