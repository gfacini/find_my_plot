Introduction

Electron identification at both high and low luminosities is one of the major tasks of the ATLAS Inner Detector (ID). In this note we study the ATLAS electron identification capabilities in the barrel region by using the ID to reconstruct the momentum of electron candidates and to match it with the calorimeter energy.

The correct identification of electrons and muons is very important as leptons have often been indicative signals for new processes. At the LHC, the capability to efficiently detect final state electrons and muons is crucial in discovering and/or making precision measurements of

* \(\mathrm{H}\rightarrow\mathrm{Z}\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\mathrm{4l}\) (l= electron or muon) by detecting these four leptons, and
* \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) by identifying isolated leptons from the W decays and by recognizing which jets in the event are from b-quarks using secondary vertex information and/or non-isolated electrons and muons.

Specific physics goals for the ATLAS ID are :

* lepton identification in conjunction with the calorimeter and muon system,
* electron charge determination,
* electron and muon momentum measurement,
* jet multiplicity and fragmentation properties,
* secondary vertex reconstruction to identify \(\tau\) leptons and b-quark jets,
* reconstruction of leptonic J/\(\psi\) and K\({}^{0}_{\mathrm{s}}\) decays to charged pions in studies of CP-violation effects in B-decays, and
* calorimeter cross-calibration with tracks.

We assume a vector tracker design consisting of inner and outer silicon sub-detectors. In order to study the effect of the TRD material on the combined tracker-calorimeter system, material corresponding to the TRD thickness is added in one configuration as passive material. The overall track-finding performance may be improved by using the TRD hits and such a study is planned to be done. For the present study, the electron identification algorithms have been optimized without this additional TRD material. In addition, we study the effect of varying both the radii at which the outer silicon layers are placed and their grouping together into superlayers.

If the information from the inner and outer silicon trackers can be successfully matched, they could provide excellent momentum measurement for matching with the electron and muon detectors since the momentum improvement due to the outer detector is expected to be obtained almost entirely from the outermost layer. The linkage should work well if the occupancy in the outermost layer is not too high and the inner tracker measurement is good enough to predict the position at the outer tracker with an accuracy approximately the size of the outer measuring element.

The ATLAS ID differs in at least two significant ways from previous tracking systems in collider experiments : the tracking technologies that are matched to LHC physics have intrinsically more mass and the desire to provide tracking over the pseudorapidity interval \(|\,\eta\,|<2.5\) means that much of the mechanical support material for the tracking system is inside the tracker. As a result, the ATLAS tracking system could have more material than previous collider experiments.

The material of the ID system impacts on the ATLAS reconstruction and identification of electrons as follows :

* Pattern Recognition : once track segments are found in the inner and outer trackers they must be unambiguously linked together to reconstruct tracks. However, bremsstrahlung fluctuations complicate this linking process thus degrading the pattern recognition.
* Momentum Resolution : the effect of material is to introduce fluctuations into the electron trajectory as energy is lost through bremsstrahlung. Therefore, the mean electron momentum drops, depending on the amount of material transvered. In addition, the 2 T magnetic field traps electrons in the extreme hard bremsstrahlung tail of the distribution thus increasing the occupancy and the radiation damage.
* Electromagnetic (EM) Calorimetry : EM showers are partially identified by requiring the transverse shower profiles to be consistent with an EM shower. Bremsstrahlung in the tracking system results in several energy deposits in the EM calorimeter rather than one from the electron shower. The radiated electron energy spreads the electron cluster out in the r\(\phi\) direction thus creating pattern recognition problems in the calorimeter also. The overall effect is that track formation using the calorimeter cluster centroid and the E/p matching criterion are both degraded.

## 2 Detector Geometrical Lay-out

### Global Lay-out

The lay-out of the detectors in this study is based on a simplified ATLAS barrel detector. All components of the tracking system are represented by concentric cylinders. Theyoperate in a homogeneous 2 T solenoidal magnetic field. In many respects the lay-out is similar to that of ATLAS INDET Note 15 [1], except for the EM calorimeter and the radial spacing of the outer tracking detectors. A three-dimensional view of the full detector set-up1 is shown in Figure 1. Four versions of the outer tracker have been studied:

Footnote 1: Without the flux return.

* The layers of the outer tracker are arranged in equally spaced pairs or double layers and were intended to be interleaved with 2 segments of TRD. Since a split version of the TRD was not available it was left out completely.
* The outer tracker is split into two parts of three layers with a TRD segment in between. The TRD is represented by a layer of inactive material (\(\sim 11\%\,\mathrm{X}_{0}\) as quoted in the LOI at its central radius.)
* This version is equivalent to version B but without the material of the TRD.
* This lay-out is most similar to that of reference [1]. The layers of the outer tracker are close together at large radius, without any material between the inner and outer tracker. This represents a design optimized for a vector tracker.

A schematic drawing of each lay-out, showing only the central part with emphasis on the outer tracking region is given in Figures 2 to 5. (Please refer to section 2.2 for a detailed description of the geometries).

### The Sub-detectors

In the following section the sub-detectors common to each lay-out will be described.

EM-Calorimeter :The calorimeter is a LAr lead sampling calorimeter with 50 samplings, all read out in one longitudinal compartment. Each sample consists of 3 mm lead and 6 mm LAr, leading to a total depth of 29 \(X_{0}\). The front face of the calorimeter is at a radius of 143.5 cm, it covers \(\mid\!\eta\mid\!\leq 1.68\) and has a granularity of \(0.02\cdot 0.02\) in \(\eta\cdot\phi\). The cells are pointing to the nominal vertex. The total amount of material in front of the calorimeter, varies from 3.40 \(X_{0}\) for set-up A to 3.51 \(X_{0}\) for set-up B.2 Footnote 2: This contains 1.74 \(X_{0}\) of tapered material for the cold preshower converters which do not increase in thickness with \(\sin^{-1}\Theta\).
**Coil :The superconducting coil produces a 2 T homogeneous solenoidal field inside its inner radius of 115 cm. The calorimeter and cold preshower are not in the field. The coil also acts as a part of the converter for the first sampling of the cold preshower and represents a total of 0.88 \(X_{0}\).**Figure 1: 3-D view of the detector geometry with an inner detector as described in Geometry A

Figure 3: Central part of Geometry B

Figure 2: Central part of Geometry A

Figure 4: Central part of Geometry C

Figure 5: Central part of Geometry D

Cryostat:The only part of interest in the cryostat are its inner walls, since they represent a part of the converter for the cold preshower. The cryostat inner wall is a 2 mm layer of iron at 136.8 cm followed by a 1 cm layer of LAr as coolant. Together this represents 0.26 \(X_{0}\). Cold Preshower :The sensitive part of the cold preshower consists of two layers of LAr of 1 cm thickness at radii of 139.5 and 141.5 cm. The converter for the first layer is partially the coil and the cryostat plus a 0.67 \(X_{0}\) layer of tapered lead. The total converter thickness3 is 1.94 \(X_{0}\). The additional converter for the second sampling consists of two layers of tapered lead with a total thickness of 1.07 \(X_{0}\). The information from the cold preshower has not yet been used for the analysis but we consider it an important tool for reducing the width of the trigger roads and thus decreasing the occupancies. This is especially important for projective detectors (e.g. TRD), since it allows the possibility to use cuts on the track-preshower match rather than on the track-calorimeter match only. The second point could be useful for the identification of electrons after catastrophic bremsstrahlung which frequently fail track-calorimeter match cuts. It could also supply further rejection of converted lower energy bremsstrahlung photons by separating two preshowers close to each other. Moderator :The moderator is a 5 cm polyethylene layer beyond the last layer of the outer tracker at a radius of 110 cm. It represents 0.11 \(X_{0}\). Inner Tracker :The inner tracker consists of four layers of silicon (0.3 mm thick) at radii of 25, 27, 29 and 31 cm with two support layers at radii of 26 and 30 cm. Each silicon layer represents 3.2 % \(X_{0}\). A support layer has a thickness of 3.7 % \(X_{0}\). The inner tracker has a length of 120 cm and a total radiation length of 8.7 % \(X_{0}\). The granularity of each layer is 50 \(\mu m\) in \(r\cdot\phi\) and 50 mm in z. Beam Pipe :The beam pipe is a 25 mm inner-diameter beryllium tube of 1 mm wall thickness representing 0.3 % \(X_{0}\). The sub-detectors which are different in each lay-out are the outer tracker and the TRD. Outer Tracker :A. For lay-out A the outer tracker consists of 3 double layers of silicon at radii of 50 and 55, 77.5 and 82.5, 100 and 105 cm with a support layer of 3.7 % \(X_{0}\) in the center of each double layer. It has a length of 180 cm and represents a total radiation length of 13 % \(X_{0}\). The second (R=55 cm) and fifth (R=100 cm) layers are pad layers for z measurement and pattern recognition and the other layers are strip layers measuring \(r\cdot\phi\). The granularity of a strip layer is 200 \(\mu m\) in \(r\cdot\phi\) and 120 mm in z. For a pad layer it is 30 mm in \(r\cdot\phi\) and 1 mm in z. B. In lay-out B the outer tracker has silicon layers at radii of 50, 52.5, 55, 100, 102.5 and 105 cm with only two support layers at 53 and 103 cm. It has the same sequence of pad and strip layers and represents a total radiation length of 9.3 % \(X_{0}\). C. In the lay-out C the outer tracker is identical to that of lay-out B. D. In lay-out D the outer tracker has layers at 95, 97, 99, 101, 103, and 105 cm with support layers at 97.5 and 103.5 cm. It represents the same radiation length as the one in lay-out B and C and has the same sequence of pad and strip layers.
**TRD :**: Only lay-out B has a TRD which is represented by inactive material centered at a radius of 78 cm and corresponding to a total radiation length of 11.1 % \(X_{0}\). Since the functional version of a TRD for this set-up was not available, the information of a real TRD could not be included in the analysis. Problems of linking up inner and outer track segments and defining narrower regions of interest for the track search could possibly be solved when the TRD information is used. Additional efficiency for the identification of electrons through the TR function of this detector could also be expected. The identification of secondary vertices from \(K_{s}\) and the measurement of the \(p_{T}\) of the decay products, which is very difficult with discrete tracking detectors alone, could be done combining the silicon detectors and the TRD.

### Functional Aspects of the Tracker Lay-out

A good concept for a discrete tracking detector with a small number of points per track is that of a large radius vector track stub detector supplying a well defined vector for a small segment of a track. Therefore its ideal shape is close to that of lay-out D where the layers are close together at large radius and near to the calorimeter and preshower detector. This allows for tight track-preshower or track-calorimeter matching cuts and a good \(p_{T}\) measurement when the segment is linked together with that of the inner tracker. The stand alone \(p_{T}\) measurement is less good than that of a tracker covering a larger radial space. In order to maximize the radial leaver arm for \(p_{T}\) measurement it is best to use strip layers for the largest and smallest radius. The functionality of the pad layers is that of the z measurement and to resolve ambiguities in the strip layers coming from multiple hits in one strip. It is intended to have the least number of ambiguities for the first and last track stub, so that a clear entry and exit point of the track is defined. This can be achieved best, when the pad layers are close to the first and last strip layer. Therefore, the natural place for the pad layers are the second and fifth layer, as close to

then digitized and considered for the following track finding. The track finding uses a combinatorial algorithm trying to fit a helix curve to the measured points.

The details of the analysis are described in the following subsections. The two tools used to calculate the helix and to perform the fit are discussed in section 4.2.

#### 4.1.2 Electromagnetic Calorimeter

The maximum energy deposited in a cell of the EM calorimeter is searched for and the energy around this cell is added up. Several window sizes are used for this: 3.3, 3.5, 3.7, 5.5, 5.7 a energy calibration factor is applied (see section 5.1). After that the window size is chosen to be 3.7 for 8 GeV \(<\) E \(<\) 30 GeV, 5.7 for 30 GeV \(<\) E \(<\) 90 G 7.7 for E \(>\) 90 GeV depending on the energy E of the electron. This reflects the different sizes of shower development (see reference [1]). A response function is applied to reflect the corrections to the calibration factor which is based on the 3.3 window

The calorimeter analysis delivers one electromagnetic cluster giving its calibrated energy and its position in \(\phi\) and \(\eta\).

#### 4.1.3 Trigger Road

Starting from the coordinates of the EM cluster, a road between the vertex region and the calorimeter is calculated. For each given radius of a silicon layer an allowed \(\phi\) and \(\eta\) range is determined. The range in \(\eta\) is \(\pm\) 200 mm at the vertex decreasing linearly to \(\pm\) 40 mm at the calorimeter front face. This corresponds to \(4\sigma_{\rm z}\) of the vertex and 1.5 calorimeter cell units at the calorimeter front face. The \(\phi\) range is \(\pm\) 0.1 rad at the vertex increasing towards the calorimeter front face according to a 2 GeV track. The \(\phi\) range at the vertex corresponds to the magnetic deflection of a 4 GeV electron. The 2 GeV is the lower limit of the transverse momentum used in the helix fit. This road covers at a radius r = 25 cm \(\sim\) 10000 of the inner tracker strips and \(\sim\) 3000 strips or pads in each layer of the outer tracker.

Only the tracker hits in the road are then digitized giving a list of coordinates for each hit strip or pad (no information on the deposited energy was used). After putting that list in increasing \(\phi\), z and r order, all hits with adjacent \(\phi\) values or with adjacent z values for the pad layers are clustered.

The road algorithm delivers a list of clusters in the tracker layers giving their coordinates and widths. In future the pulse height information will be used to calculate pulse height weighted cluster centroids in order to improve the position accuracy.

#### 4.1.4 Track Finding

A helix curve is tried on all combinations of clusters in the inner tracker using the method described in subsection 4.2.2. First, a fit with clusters in layers (1,4), (1,3) or (1,2) is tried. If its \(\chi^{2}<4\) per degree of freedom, the closest clusters in the unused layers are picked up to complete the track. The clusters are allowed to deviate from the calculated position by \({\rm d}\,\phi_{\mbox{max}}=5\) and \({\rm d}\eta_{\mbox{max}}=1.2\) average cluster widths of the clusters in that layer. The calorimeter cluster is included in the fit and the match between the track extrapolation and the calorimeter cluster position is required to be better than 0.75 calorimeter cell units in \(\eta\) and 4 calorimeter cell units in \(\phi\). This corresponds to 25\(\sigma_{\eta}\) and to 133\(\sigma_{\phi}\) of the calorimeter position resolution of a 40 GeV electron (see section 5.1). The \(\phi\) value of the cluster position is not fitted because the bremsstrahlung is not corrected for. All the track candidates with at least 3 of the 4 layers and a \(\chi^{2}<5\) per degree of freedom are then stored.

The above algorithm is repeated for the outer tracker starting from the layer combinations (1,6,5), (1,6,2), (1,4,2) or (3,6,5) and requiring an initial \(\chi^{2}<2.5\) per degree of freedom. The initial layer combinations all include one pad layer to reduce combinatorial background. The calorimeter cluster is included in this fit with the same requirements as for the inner tracker. After picking up the closest hits in the remaining layers all track candidates with at least 5 of 6 layers and a \(\chi^{2}<4\) per degree of freedom are stored.

To find the global tracks, all combinations of stored track candidates in the inner and outer tracker are used and the individual clusters making up the track candidates are refitted. This time the global fit allows for one bremsstrahlung kink as described in subsection 4.2.2. The calorimeter cluster position is included in the fit using both its \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) values. The match between the track extrapolation and the calorimeter cluster position is required to be as described above.

The combination with the best \(\chi^{2}<5\) per degree of freedom and the most layers used for the fit is then taken as the electron candidate for the following analysis. If no such global track is found then the electron is not identified thus increasing the inefficiency of the track finding algorithm.

### Analysis Tools

#### 4.2.1 Helix

The helix is a 3-dimensional curve described in 5 parameters:

* a\({}_{0}\) the transverse projection of the impact parameter at the vertex,
* z\({}_{0}\) the z-coordinate at the vertex,
* \(\phi_{0}\) the \(\phi\) direction at the vertex,
* \(\frac{\mathrm{d}\mathrm{z}}{\mathrm{d}r}\)\(|_{0}\)\(\frac{1}{\mathrm{tan}\theta}\) of the \(\theta\) direction at the vertex,
* \(\frac{1}{\mathrm{p}_{T}}\) the inverse transverse momentum.

The helix is calculated in steps extrapolating from a given point to the end radius or z coordinate specified. Each step uses the 5 parameters above and is limited to have a maximum turning angle d\(\phi_{\mathrm{max}}\) = 0.1 rad.

#### 4.2.2 Helix Fit

An iterative \(\chi^{2}\) minimization is used to fit given points to a helix curve. Given a set of measured points and their errors, the fit will calculate the five parameters of a helix curve (for the normal fit) and a \(\chi^{2}\) per degree of freedom as a measure of the fit's quality.

The fit can optionally allow for one bremsstrahlung kink appearing at one of a set of fixed radii. These radii are chosen to be the radii of layers 1 to 4 of the inner tracker, radii 1 and 2 of the outer tracker and specifically for Geometry B, the radius of the TRD. Then a sixth parameter is added to the fit: the energy loss at the kink where the hard bremsstrahlung occurs. The energy of this bremsstrahlung is constrained using the correlation with the calorimeter impact position taking its error into account. The normal fit (with no bremsstrahlung) is tried first, followed by a bremsstrahlung fit in which the bremsstrahlung position is tried at the position of each allowed radius in turn. The solution with the best \(\chi^{2}\) per degree of freedom is retained (see reference [1]).

## 5 Simulation of the Calorimeter

### Calorimeter Calibration

The analysis is triggered by an EM cluster in the calorimeter. For the initial track finding the energy information of the calorimeter is used only to determine the width of a road from the calorimeter to the vertex in which the track search is performed and it is not needed with a good absolute precision.

However, after a track candidate has been found it will have to pass an E/p cut for which a precise energy measurement is important. The tuning of the calorimeter is done in two steps: the calibration and the response tuning. The aim of the calibration is to obtain an estimate for the energy of an electron (or gamma) from the energy deposited in an EM cluster. For a window of fixed size a calibration function4 can be determined that will multiply the seen energy in the window with a constant to give the energy of the initial particle. This function is given as a set of discrete values and is shown in Figure 9.

Footnote 4: It is a function of energy

To obtain a correct estimate for other window sizes a response function has to be used. This will contain calibration constants for all other windows, normalized to that of the calibrated window. In this analysis since only the 3 window was calibrated, the response function was therefore not necessary.

### Calorimeter Position Resolution

For the initial track finding the position information of the calorimeter is more important than its energy measurement. In this section the position of an EM cluster as measured by the calorimeter refers to the energy weighted barycenter of the cluster. Even though the position depends on the the energy measurement it is independent of an overall calibration constant and the response function, but strongly depends on the energy resolution, the granularity and the primary particle energy as well as the material distribution in the inner detector. In the following list the principle influence of these parameters on the position resolution is explained.

**Granularity:**: A finer granularity will enhance the position resolution. In the extreme case with cells large enough to fully contain the shower the resolution is limited by \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{12}}\cdot\Delta\) where \(\Delta\) denotes the granularity. In the other extreme the resolution is limited through the decrease in energy resolution of an individual cell which is a result of the increasing fluctuations of deposited energy in a cell of decreasing size.
**Energy Resolution:**: The energy weighted barycenter of the shower can be determined more precisely if the errors on the weighting factors decrease.
**Primary Particle Energy:**: The lateral size of an EM shower scales roughly with \(\ln E\). As the shower increases in lateral size more cells can be used to determine the shower centroid. Also the relative error of the energy measurement in each cell scales like \(\frac{1}{\sqrt{E}}\) and improves the error of the resulting cluster centroid.
**Material:**: It can be expected that, due to bremsstrahlung processes in the ID the showers will broaden in the \(r\phi\) direction. To first order this does not shift the centroid if the energy of the photon is small in comparison to the energy of the electron.

#### 5.2.1 Expected Cluster Position

The variable measuring the position resolution of the calorimeter is the sigma of the difference between the expected and the measured cluster centroids. To obtain the expected

Figure 9: Calibration function for the \(3\cdot 3\) window versus energyposition it has to be calculated from the initial event parameters5. To do this the following points have to be considered:

Footnote 5: These are the vertex position, the \(\Theta\) and \(\phi\) of the particle axis at the vertex and its energy.

1. The shower has an energy-dependent length.
2. Because the particle traverses material in the ID the start of the shower is not at the calorimeter front face.
3. The material traversed depends on the particle's polar angle \(\Theta\).
4. The particle trajectory is a helix as long as it is in the coil but the shower in the calorimeter is straight.
5. The particle does not impact perpendicular to the calorimeter face due to its curvature in the field and its inclination in \(\eta\).
6. The particle does not come from the nominal vertex but can have a large offset along the z-axis. The impact parameter is always zero.

Point 1) :To parametrize the average length of the shower the work of [2] is used. Here the energy dependence of the depth at which the shower contains the maximum number of electrons is parameterized as:

\[t_{max}[X_{0}]=3.9+\ln\,E_{initial}\,[GeV]. \tag{1}\]

Into this a second parameter was introduced to account for the fact that the longitudinal centroid is not identical with \(t_{max}\)6, since the longitudinal shower profile is very asymmetric around \(t_{max}\). The parametrization used is therefore:

Footnote 6: An analytical expression for the longitudinal centroid of the shower was not available

\[t_{max}[X_{0}]=\alpha\cdot(3.9+\ln\,E_{initial}\,[GeV]) \tag{2}\]

where \(\alpha\) is tuned on a sample of 5500 electron events of 40 GeV over the full \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) range. The result of this tuning is shown in Figure 10. In the analysis \(\alpha\) was assumed to be 2.0. Assuming no material in front of the calorimeter the shower length will vary from 9.7 to 13.2 cm for electrons from 10 to 100 GeV.

Point 2) :The material in front of the calorimeter is partially tapered and does not show an increase in \(\eta\). At \(\eta=0\) there are 1.48 \(X_{0}\) of untapered and 1.74 \(X_{0}\) of tapered material in front of the calorimeter.

Figure 10: Tuning of shower length parametrization. Position resolution in cell units versus tuning parameter

Point 3) :To calculate the impact point of the particle onto the calorimeter the first intersection of two circles was calculated. From this the turning angle of an electron can be calculated as: \[d\phi=\frac{\pi}{2}\cdot\frac{R_{calo}}{2R_{curv}}\quad with\,\quad R_{ curv}=0.3\cdot\frac{B[T]}{P[GeV]}.\] (3) A 10 GeV electron will turn for 2.5\({}^{o}\) before impacting on the calorimeter. Point 4) :The shower axis is not perpendicular to the calorimeter face but deviates by the angles \(\delta\eta\) and \(\delta\phi\). For \(\delta\phi\) the following expression was found: \[\delta\phi=\arcsin\left(\frac{R_{calo}}{2R_{curv}}\right)\quad where\quad \delta\phi(10\ GeV)=0.067^{o}.\] (4) The \(\delta\eta\) is given through \(\Theta\) at the vertex and the z-vertex position. Depending on \(\delta\phi\) and \(l_{shower}\), the shower appears at a different \(\phi\) position at the impact point on the calorimeter. This difference is given by: \[\Delta\phi=\arctan\left(\frac{\sin\left(\delta\phi(E)\right)\cdot l_{shower} (E)}{R_{calo}+\cos\left(\delta\phi(E)\cdot l_{shower}(E)\right)}\right)\] (5) This correction is usually negligible. For 10 GeV particles it is \(\Delta\phi=(4\cdot 10^{-3})^{o}\). Point 5) :Since the calorimeter is projective to the nominal vertex and divided into \(\eta\)-cells the corrections for the vertex smearing have to be translated into a corrected \(\eta\) position. A particle coming from a vertex at \(z=z_{vtx}\) with an angle of \(\Theta\) will be seen in the calorimeter at an \(\eta\) of: \[\eta_{true}=-\ln(\tan\left(\frac{\Theta_{true}}{2}\right))\quad where\quad \Theta_{true}=\arctan\left(\frac{R_{calo}\cdot\tan\,\Theta}{z_{vtx}\cdot\tan\, \Theta+R_{calo}}\right)\] (6)

Figure 11 shows the measured versus the expected position of the cluster centroid for 100 GeV electrons in cell units. The band around the central fit indicates which points have been considered in the fit. Points outside the band are considered to have a badly calculated expected position. The granularity is \(\Delta\eta_{cell}=2.87\ cm\) and \(\Delta\phi_{cell}=2.82\ cm\) The tangent like behaviour of the measured position is as expected. It is due to an increase in energy sharing between adjacent cells if the particle impacts near the border of two cells. The better energy sharing leads to an improved accuracy of the measured centroid. In [3] this phenomenon is described for testbeam measurements of a LAr calorimeter with accordion like geometry. The results are in good agreement with the simulation as can be seen from Table 2, where the parameters of the tangent fit for the \(\eta\) position at 100 GeV are compare to testbeam results at 122 GeV.

Figures 12 and 13 show the difference between the measured and expected positions in \(\eta\) and \(\phi\) with a Gaussian fit to determine the resolution, for 10 and 100 GeV electrons.

Figure 13: \(\eta_{meas\,s}-\eta_{exp}\) and \(\phi_{meas\,s}-\phi_{e\,xp}\) in cell units for 10 GeV electrons

Events are rejected if the width of the cluster in \(\phi\) is larger than 3.5 cells or if the track finding algorithm has successfully fitted a helix with a bremsstrahlung kink to the measured track. These events are not used for the fit in \(\phi\). The rejected events are shown as the hatched area in Figure 14. It is visible that the measured position of the majority these events deviate towards larger \(\phi\)-values which corresponds to a smaller radius of curvature.

#### 5.2.2 Comparison with Testbeam Data

Performing the above analysis for electrons of 10, 20, 40, 80 and 100 GeV the position resolution as a function of energy has been determined and is shown in Figure 14. The result of the fit for \(\eta\) is:

\[\sigma_{\eta}=\frac{0.180\pm 0.009}{\sqrt{E}[GeV]}-(4.1\pm 1.4)\cdot 10^{-2}. \tag{7}\]

For the \(\phi\) coordinate the resolution is slightly worse and the fit is contained to have a positive constant term:

\[\sigma_{\phi}=\frac{0.216\pm 0.003}{\sqrt{E}[GeV]}+(0.0\pm 1.0)\cdot 10^{-2}. \tag{8}\]

Using these formulae to extrapolate the resolution to the testbeam energy of 122 GeV we obtain position resolutions of:

* \(\sigma_{\eta}(122GeV)=(587\pm 45)\mu m\)
* \(\sigma_{\phi}(122GeV)=(551\pm 28)\mu m\)
* \(\sigma_{\it{testbeam}m}(122GeV)=(570\pm 25)\mu m\)Figure 14: Position resolutions versus energy for 100 GeV electrons

Track Reconstruction

### Track Segments in the Inner and Outer Trackers

The pattern recognition is initially performed separately in the inner and outer trackers. Figures 15 and 16 show the fitted value of 1/p for segments found in the inner tracker plotted against that found in the outer tracker for 20 GeV incident electrons. The central cluster is due to electrons not having undergone bremsstrahlung. The band of points running to high values of 1/p, i.e. to low values of momentum, is due to bremsstrahlung after the inner tracker. The events having high values of 1/p in both the inner and outer trackers are caused by bremsstrahlung effects either before or in the inner tracker which disturb both measurements. Finally, the region at low values of 1/p, i.e. large values of momentum, is due to a bremsstrahlung photon which converts sufficiently early to be reconstructed in the outer tracker. These conversions have a low impact parameter so that the vertex constraint causes them to be reconstructed with an artificially high momentum value.

It can be observed in Figures 15 and 16 that the set-up which reproduces most accurately the nominal 20 GeV momentum in the outer tracker is Geometry C and is reflected in the relatively narrow spread of the central cluster of the reconstructed momentum distribution. The addition of the TRD material as in Geometry B deteriorates the momentum measurement by enhancing the bremsstrahlung tail seen at large values of 1/p. Geometry D is the least adequate in reproducing the nominal 20 GeV momentum as can be seen by the relatively wide central cluster. Therefore, the momentum measurement is superior for a tracker covering a larger radial space, since the radial lever arm is increased, and for a set-up consisting of the minimal amount of material.

Figures 17 and 18 show the fitted momentum for the track segments in the inner and outer trackers, respectively, for electrons of 20 GeV nominal momentum. Whereas the inner tracker is free from any appreciable tail in its momentum distribution, the outer tracker momentum measurement has deteriorated by the presence of a tail at low momentum values caused by electrons losing energy due to bremsstrahlung effects.

### Matching Segments and the Global Helix Fit

Track segments are then matched between the inner and outer trackers and a global helix fit is performed for each combination. Figures 19 and 20 show the momentum resulting from a global helix fit for the various configurations. The tail in the outer tracker's momentum distribution is inherently part of the momentum distribution produced by the global helix fit.

Figures 21 to 24 show the \(\chi^{2}\) values for the inner and outer trackers alone and for the

full tracker after the global helix fit for the various geometries for nominal 20 GeV tracks. The track segment fits give good individual \(\chi^{2}\) values since the effect of material within either tracker is small. However, the combined fit has a long tail to high \(\chi^{2}\) values because the momentum reconstructed in the two trackers are not always compatible due to bremsstrahlung effects.

As expected, the track segment in the inner tracker is the same for all configurations. However, the \(\chi^{2}\) value of the track segment in the outer tracker is consistently better for Geometry D and is reflected in the smaller mean and rms values of its \(\chi^{2}\) distribution. This suggests that the best track fits are obtained in the case when the silicon layers are placed closest together and at a radius close to the calorimeter front-face. When the silicon layers are close together there is less radial space between sensitive regions for bremsstrahlung effects to develop as would in the case if the outer tracker is split up as in Geometry C, for example. Furthermore, Geometry D produces the better \(\chi^{2}\) values when the global helix fit is performed since the vector track stub from the outer tracker is of a better quality.

### Correcting for the Bremsstrahlung Energy Loss

The bremsstrahlung spectrum is peaked at low energies and is more likely to occur in regions of highest density. In the configurations we are considering, bremsstrahlung is most likely to occur in the tracking layers and in the case of Geometry B also in the TRD material. Since the total thickness of the ID is less than a radiation length, we expect on average a single bremsstrahlung photon to spoil the electron momentum.

To account for the bremsstrahlung energy loss, as is seen in the tail of the global helix fit, a dedicated procedure is implemented as described in section 4.2.2. Figures 25 and 26 show the momentum distributions from the bremsstrahlung fit for various configurations with tracks of 20 GeV nominal momentum. The almost complete removal of the bremsstrahlung tail can be clearly seen. The track fit quality has improved as is shown in Figures 27 and 28 since the long tail at high \(\chi^{2}\) values has been removed. It is also seen that the difference in the track quality between the different geometries is smaller than with the global helix fit alone.

The momentum resolution for 100 GeV electron tracks is shown in Figures 29 and 30 where the nominal 100 GeV electron momentum is subtracted from the momentum calculated by the bremsstrahlung fit with the resolution taken as the rms of the Gaussian fit. Figure 31 summarizes the momentum resolution as a function of the electron incident energy for the various geometrical configurations. As expected, the momentum resolution increases with increasing electron incident momenta. The set-up of Geometry D provides the best momentum resolution which for 100 GeV tracks is 2.6%, whereas the most inferior momentum resolution is obtained with Geometry A which gives a momentum resolution Figure 21: Quality of track fits with Geometry A

photon converting. A typical event failing the outer tracker track reconstruction algorithm is shown in Figure 35. The photon is not deflected by the magnetic field and generally its trajectory is sufficiently long for the conversion track segment to be well-separated from the 'ideal helix' impact given by the calorimeter cluster centroid. Thus, most of the outer tracker ambiguities fail to give an acceptable track-calorimeter match or electron fit \(\chi^{2}\). In some cases the bremsstrahlung is sufficiently hard so that the primary electron is swept from the trigger road by the magnetic field (see Figure 36).

The configuration which includes the material of the TRD (Geometry B) has the largest number of ambiguities. Removing the TRD material then brings the electron track reconstruction efficiency to a similar level as for Geometry A. The set-up which has the least number of ambiguities is Geometry D with its six outer silicon layers close to the calorimeter and the least amount of material. As discussed in section 2.3, this geometry is expected to provide the ideal outer tracker configuration but is disfavoured because of the high cost of producing an outer tracker with its six layers at such large radii.

In addition, it is possible to calculate the 'fake' track rate which is the sum of all reconstructed tracks greater than one in the event. These fake tracks are produced artificially by the track reconstruction algorithm since nominally there is only one incident electron track. In all geometries and for all energies studied, the fake track rate is \(\leq 2-3\%\).

The electron identification algorithm can be improved by including an E/p cut. Figure 37 shows the distribution of E/p for 20 GeV electrons for Geometry D using the normal helix fit (top plot) and the bremsstrahlung fit (bottom plot). The almost complete removal of the bremsstrahlung tail can be clearly seen in the latter diagram. Figures 38 to 40 summarize the efficiency of various E/p cuts for all the geometries studied. The statistical uncertainties are \(\leq\pm 1.0\%\), \(\leq\pm 1.2\%\), and \(\leq\pm 1.7\%\) for the 20, 40, and 100 Gev E/p efficiencies, respectively. For a cut E/p \(<1.3\) for electrons of 20 GeV nominal energy using the Geometry D set-up, the efficiency improves from 90% with the helix fit to \(>99\%\) with the bremsstrahlung fit. As expected the E/p efficiency decreases with increasing electron energies. Following directly from the above conclusions on the momentum resolution, the lowest E/p efficiency from the bremsstrahlung fit is obtained, in general, with Geometry A whereas the other geometries do not vary significantly between themselves.

## 7 Conclusions

Detailed studies have been made on the electron identification capabilities in the barrel region of the ATLAS detector using various inner detector geometries.

The figures of merit we have considered are a) the reproduction of the nominal electron momentum, b) the quality of the global helix fit, c) the momentum resolution, d) the track-finding efficiency, and e) the E/p cut efficiency. We conclude that in all the above points except for point a), the geometry consisting of all six outer tracker layers close together at large radii provides the ideal outer tracker configuration. However, this geometry is disfavoured because of the high cost of producing an outer tracker with its six layers at large radii. As a compromise scenario we propose a configuration where only the three outer silicon layers are placed at large radii and the other three are moved in to smaller radii. We advize against splitting up the outer tracker into three superlayers of two silicon layers each because such a configuration gives an inferior performance. It should be noted that this last configuration is the one most similar to the geometry proposed in reference [4].

We have also developed methods which improve the calorimeter position resolution to the point where the simulated resolution now agrees with testbeam results of a LAr calorimeter. The results of our track-finding studies do not use the new calorimeter

It should be pointed out no information from the TRD has been used in this work. It is left as a future study to investigate the effect of the TRD information on the figures of merit we have presented here.
