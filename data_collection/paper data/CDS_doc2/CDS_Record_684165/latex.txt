###### Abstract

The current alignment design for the muon endcap of the ATLAS detector is shown to be unable to provide the design accuracy. A proposal is made how to bring the alignment precision to the required level by adding a small number of optical sensors.

Introduction

The current alignment design for the muon endcap of the ATLAS detector has been implemented in a new Monte Carlo simulation program [1]. It was found that, and understood why, this design is unable to provide the precision required for the sagitta measurement of high-momentum muons. A proposal is made how to bring the alignment accuracy to the required level by adding a small number of optical sensors. The reader is expected to be familiar with the sensors used in the endcap alignment: BCAMs, RASNIKs, and proximity sensors.

## 2 Problem

The optical alignment of MDT endcap chambers with respect to alignment bars is based on pairs of parallel proximity sensors looking respectively from large chambers to bars, from small chambers to bars, and from large chambers to small chambers. In this respect the current design deviates from the one presented in the Technical Design Report [2]. The design alignment accuracy is defined by the requirement that the alignment contribution to false sagitta measurements be less than \(30\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\).

### History

Earlier alignment simulations implemented for simplification only one big MDT chamber, representing a large and a small one which were assumed to be rigidly connected by optical sensors (RASNIKs). The components of the RASNIKs (CCD, lens, mask) were separated by relatively long distances, equal to about half the chamber width. Later, it was decided to replace the long-range RASNIK systems by proximity sensors (BCAM-like sensors used according to the RASNIK principle, i.e. looking at an illuminated mask focused on the CCD). It turns out that for these sensors the above simplification is no longer valid.

### Method

A toy geometry (Fig. 1) resembling that of the planned H8 test setup of one muon endcap octant has been implemented in the new alignment simulation program [1]. The dimensions of bars and chambers and the positions of sensors are realistic to about 10-20%, which is sufficient for the study presented here.1 The mounting accuracy of proximity sensors on chambers (including the contribution from sensor calibration) has been assumed to be \(\sigma=10\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) (shifts) and \(\sigma=50\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro rad}\) (rotations); that of masks on chambers and bars has been assumed to be \(\sigma=10\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) (shifts only). The intrinsic resolution was assumed to be \(1\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) transverse to and \(20\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) along the sensor looking direction. These assumptions are believed to be rather optimistic than pessimistic. Similar mounting accuracies were assumed for the other optical sensors.

Footnote 1: As a check, a geometry resembling that of former studies with only one big chamber had been implemented. This implementation was found to satisfactorily reproduce the results of those studies.

For this geometry and sensor accuracies, the simulation yields a false sagitta distribution with an r.m.s. width of about \(200\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\) and long non-gaussian tails up to about \(800\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolMicro m}\), thus more than a factor of six worse than the design specification (Fig. 2). The effect is most prominent in the chamber-chamber overlap region. In Fig. 3, the typical result of a single run of the simulation program is shown. The largest deviations of reconstructed from true positions are found in the chamber-chamber overlap region, as expected.

This can be understood from the following consideration (Fig. 4a,b): a proximity sensor is blind to a certain class of misalignment, namely to displacements of the sensor on a sphere around an arbitrary point on the mask, provided that the sensor always looks at the center of the sphere (for small misalignments compared to the separation sensor-mask). Thus, given that the two chamber-chamber proximity sensors are oriented parallel, the two chambers can undetectedly perform rotations around the alignment bars, resulting in a mispositioning along the beam axis that is most prominent in the chamber-chamber overlap region. This is a problem because the positions of the chambers along the beam enter the sagitta calculation in addition to the positions in the bending direction, i.e. transverse to the beam.2

Footnote 2: The complete answer is slightly more complicated. The muon spectrometer alignment concept is based on the consideration that absolute positions of MDT chambers need not be known to a very high precision, because only certain relative positions are of interest, namely the relative positions of those chambers in different stations that can be crossed by one muon track. In fact, the current alignment design allows to reconstruct absolute positions only to an accuracy of about 1 mm. The real reason why the undetected displacements along the beam axis are a problem is therefore not primarily the magnitude of these displacements, but the fact that they are completely uncorrelated between different stations (simply because there is no sensor that ensures their correlation).

The first idea therefore is to reverse the orientation of one of the chamber-chamber proximity sensors (Fig. 4c,d). Indeed, this improves the alignment precision significantly to an r.m.s. width of about 125 um. But it does not fully solve the problem.

The reason is that, independent of the sensor blindness, the sensor mounting accuracy limits the achievable precision (Fig. 4e). If the large and the small chamber are connected by two optical sensors with an angular mounting accuracy of 50 \(\upmu\)rad, the relative angle of the two chambers cannot be constrained to better than 50 \(\upmu\)rad\(/\sqrt{2}=35\) \(\upmu\)rad (the small additional contribution from the shift mounting accuracy is neglected here). Since the chamber-bar proximity sensors constrain the chamber positions close to the bars very well, the chambers are eventually reconstructed at a non-vanishing angle (uncertain to 35 \(\upmu\)rad\(/2\)) with respect to their nominal position, the largest deviation being located in the chamber-chamber overlap region. Given the width of e.g. the EOL chamber in the toy geometry of about 6 m, this yields an uncertainty of 100 \(\upmu\)m along the beam direction, and thus derived false sagittas must be of the same order of magnitude.

This argument also shows that placing the sensors farther away from the targets (i.e. shifting them towards the centers of the chambers) can not be the solution to the problem, because it does not reduce the contribution from the angular uncertainty. This could only be reduced if a RASNIK system consisting of three (instead of two) separate objects (CCD, lens, mask) were used: in this case, the angular uncertainty would be derived from the individual shift uncertainties of CCD and lens and from their separation, and thus decrease for increasing CCD-lens separation. Even then, however, the lens-mask separation would not enter at all.

## 3 Solution

Since no simple modification of the current design appears to be able to improve the alignment precision sufficiently, the effect of adding a small number of sensors has been studied. Several different configurations were implemented in the simulation, culminating in the two proposals presented below (the second one was originally suggested by [3]). Returning instead to the original concept of long-range RASNIK systems instead of proximity sensors would require significant modifications to the chambers, the series production of which is about to start.

### Proposal 1

The first proposal (Fig. 5) is to add two BCAMs (or proximity sensors) on each chamber, looking at targets on the opposite bar (i.e. the bar to which no direct optical connection existed before). For such a configuration, the simulation yields a false sagitta distribution with an r.m.s. width of 35 \(\upmu\)m (Fig. 6), close to the design value and to previous results.3This proposal somewhat reproduces the simplified situation that was used in alignment simulations before, where each chamber had four sensors looking at two bars. The reason why it can improve the alignment precision significantly is that a small (and thus indetectable) rotation of a chamber around one bar creates a relatively large and detectable shift in the reading of a sensor looking at a target on the opposite bar.

Some possible modifications of this proposal include the following: BCAMs looking the other way, i.e. from bars to chambers, are not suffic if they are the only added sensors, and do not improve the precision if they are added in addition to the BCAMs looking from chambers to bars. Adding only one BCAM per chamber is also not sufficient. Implementing only the proposed BCAMs looking from the small respectively the large chambers to the opposite bars results in a slight deterioration of the r.m.s. width to \(39\,\upmu\)m respectively \(37\,\upmu\)m. Adding all proposed BCAMs and removing the chamber-chamber proximity sensors yields an r.m.s. width of \(44\,\upmu\)m.

It could be possible to mount the additional BCAMs on the existing rails on the chambers which are currently used for the proximity sensors. If it is decided to remove the chamber-chamber proximity sensors, one might also think of slightly modifying them instead by equipping them with a lens of longer focal length and having them look at a target mounted on the opposite bar instead of the other chamber.

### Proposal 2

The second proposal (Fig. 7) is to add for each station one pair of BCAMs which sit on one of the bars and look at two targets, one of which is fixed to a chamber (close to the chamber-chamber overlap region), while the other is attached to the opposite bar. An r.m.s. width of the false sagitta distribution of \(29\,\upmu\)m (Fig. 8) is achieved for a configuration where the BCAM placed on the bar near the large chamber (the left bar in Fig. 7) looks at targets fixed to the large chamber and the opposite bar, while the BCAM placed on the bar near the small chamber (the right bar) looks at targets fixed to the small chamber and the opposite bar.

This proposal exploits, in analogy to the polar alignment, that mounting accuracies do not contribute to the total precision if only the relative position of two targets is to be measured.

Some possible modifications of this proposal include the following: in the above configuration, the contribution of the second BCAM is actually negligible, so it could be omitted without loss of precision. If one more target were added to one of the chambers, such that a BCAM could look a three targets (one on each of the chambers and one on the opposite bar), one of the chamber-chamber proximity sensors could be omitted. Removing the target on the opposite bar, however, is not possible without a significant deterioration of the result.

This proposal could be partially implemented by displacing the BCAMs which are currently responsible for the azimuthal alignment in such a way that they see in addition the targets on the chambers. As there are two pairs of azimuthal BCAMs in each station octant, this would result in an increase of the number of sensors only for stations with more than two pairs of chambers per octant.

### Concluding remarks

A direct comparision of the r.m.s. widths between the two proposals is not too meaningful, because they depend on many parameters that are currently not very precisely known, especially the mounting accuracies and intrinsic resolutions of the respective sensors. Given this, both of them are deemed to be compatible with the required value of \(30\,\upmu\)m, and the choice should rather be based e.g. on the technical feasibility.
