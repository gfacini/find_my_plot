###### Abstract

The cooling performance test of the 52U rack, housing SCT LV&HV power supplies for 192 detector modules, being located in USA15 cavern, has been curried out. The rack was equipped with two air-water heat exchangers, air turbine, four vertical fan tray units under crates and horizontal fans in four Artesyn AC/DC power supply units. The resistive dummy loads for 192 power supply channels have been placed in four crates and housed in the adjacent rack. The loads have been connected to the power supplies by 192 test cables routed under the floor.

Each LV power supply card contains on-board temperature sensor which is an integral part of the master card processor ADuC812. Temperature of air above crates and temperature of outgoing air from Artesyn units have been measured by eight sensors PT1000 and eight sensors NTC, respectively. The next sensor NTC measured temperature of water on incoming tube in the rack. SCT DCS has controlled and monitored LV&HV power supplies and LV card temperatures and the multi-channel ADC has monitored 16 temperature sensors.

It was shown that temperature measured on LV cards working at maximum power is lower than 30\({}^{\rm o}\) C and temperature of air above the top crate is lower than 25\({}^{\rm o}\)C in case that water temperature is not higher than 18\({}^{\rm o}\) C. Temperature of the air flow at the input to the power pack is \(\sim\)25\({}^{\rm o}\) C and at the output \(\sim\)30\({}^{\rm o}\) C.

It was demonstrated that cooling system is redundant by switching off the turbine and by switching off two pairs of fan trays. In both cases the LV temperature increase was not higher than 4\({}^{\rm o}\) C. It means that any swap of failure fan tray or a repair of turbine can be done in time when ATLAS will not take data.

Water flow and water temperature is crucial for a cooling of the PS rack. Without water flow, within 30 minutes the LV temperature of the top crate reached 50\({}^{\rm o}\) C what is the alarm limit and crate had to be turned off.

One can conclude that cooling system consisting of two air-water heat exchangers, turbine and four fan trays is effective and sufficient for long term running of SCT LV&HV power supplies.

Architecture of the SCT power supply system is described in the document[1, 8].

**Power distribution in the rack:**

In total 5 output lines from the distribution chassis are protected by 5 circuit breakers.

Power distribution schema is given in the table (from left to right).

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Output line with CB & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 \\ \hline Output Connectors & 3 & 3 & 3 & 1 & Cable to turbine \\ \hline Output 1 & PP\_0 & PP\_3 & PP\_2 & PP\_1 & - \\ \hline Output 2 & Free & Fan Tray\_0 & Fan tray\_1 & - & - \\ \hline Output 3 & Free & Fan Tray\_3 & Fan Tray-2 & - & - \\ \hline \end{tabular}

**Installation of cards in crates:**

The LV and HV cards[2, 3] have been plugged-in all crates together with SCT Interlock Cards[4] (SIC), the Shorting cards in "short mode" and with the Crate Controllers[7] (CC).

#### Installation of temperature sensors:

Temperature of air at the output from each ARTESYN power pack[5] unit was measured by 2 NTC sensors connected by 2m long wires to multi-channel analog/digital converter with PC.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Channel ADC & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 \\ \hline NTC location & PP0\_NTC1 & PP0\_NTC2 & PP1\_NTC3 & PP1\_NTC4 & PP3\_NTC5 & PP3\_NTC6 & PP2\_NTC7 & PP2\_NTC8 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

Temperature of air above the top Crate\_0 was measured by 8 PT1000 sensors. Sensors have been placed on plastic plate 5 cm one from another and plate was located 5 cm from the backplane (hottest place on LV cards) and connected to the ADC channels 1-8.

Next temperature sensor was placed on water tube going to the rack after the input valve. Sensor was connected to the ADC channel 2 instead of PP0\_NTC2.

The humidity probe and next PT100 have been monitored by KEITHLEY 6517. Sensors have been placed on top of the protective grid of the Crate\_0.

#### Control and monitor systems:

* **PROGRAM** in Pascal for control and monitor of LV and HV cards, connection over serial port to the custom crate controller.
* **LABview** for control and monitor of LV cards with graphical display and archive files. Connection over serial port to the custom crate controller.
* **PVSS** for 4 crates installed on the Local workstation.
* **Program for multi-channel** analog/digital conversion, monitoring, with graphical display and archive files.

## 2 Measurement.

#### First turn on of the rack:

Water valve has been open and according to CERN technician, temperature was oscillating between 15.8\({}^{\circ}\)C and 16.2\({}^{\circ}\) C. Measured temperature on the water tube was about 18\({}^{\circ}\)C and at night even 19-21\({}^{\circ}\)C.

Turbine and four ARTESYN power packs and fan trays have been switched on.

With the home controller and PROGRAM the LV&HV cards have been turned on. All cards were working. LABview monitored all LV card parameters including "LV temperature" measured by sensor inside the master card processor.

The home controller has been swapped with ELMB crate controllers and PVSS monitored all crates.

Temperatures measured by PT1000 and NTC were monitored and stored.

One can see that temperature of air above crates and of air outgoing from the ARTESYN PS units follows linearly the water temperature.

**Different sets of LV and HV parameters:**

Three different sets have been used.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline  & **NOMINAL** & **HIGH POWER** & **STAND BY** \\ \hline
**Vec** & 3.5 & 4.2 & 2.5 \\ \hline
**Vdd** & 4.0 & 4.5 & 4.0 \\ \hline
**HV** & 150 & 150 & 2 \\ \hline
**Icc** & 1.04 & 1.24 & 0.77 \\ \hline
**Idd** & 1.1 & 1.22 & 1.1 \\ \hline
**Vccout 1)** & 7.6 & 9.15 & 5.5 \\ \hline
**Vdodout 1)** & 8.1 & 9.0 & 8.1 \\ \hline
**VCSEL** & 4.0 & 5.0 & 4.0 \\ \hline
**VPIN** & 6.0 & 8.0 & 6.0 \\ \hline
**Output power/crate** & 868W & 1132W & 681W \\ \hline
**Power Pack power 2)** & 4.3kW & 5.7kW & 3.4kW \\ \hline
**AFE2000 mean power** & 1075W & 1425W & 850W \\ \hline \end{tabular}

1) The output voltages depend on the length of test cables. Given values are for 4m long test cables.

2) Efficiency of LV&HV cards is about 80%.

**Measurement of current supplying crates:**

High power: Current given in Amps. Total input power to four crates including the voltage drop is ~6kW.

Current was measured by the contact-less ammeter on the power distribution wires supplying different sections in the crates.

The 48VDC-to-5VDC converter is supplied from Section\_1 of each crate which explains the higher current than in other sections.

Currents in all three sections of the Crate\_0 are smaller than ones in other crates by about 20%. This observation is partially explained (~6%) by shorter test cables (4m) used for the Crate\_0 (5\)m for other crates) and very probably by a mistake during measurement with contact-less ammeter. Also one can not explain that higher current by the different voltage drops along the power distribution cables.

There is shown in this fig. the temperature difference of the LV cards and air as a function of relative position of PT1000 sensors and slots with LV cards in the crate.

One can see that the air temperature in average is lower than the LV card temperature by about 5\({}^{\circ}\)C. LV sensor is an integral part of the master card processor and its accuracy is about \(\pm\)2\({}^{\circ}\)C and therefore in next figures the average LV temperature will be presented. The observed negative trend of LV temperature is a fluctuation as one can see from next figure. There is no evidence in the rack that the air flow is not isotropic.

**LV temperature for different sets of LV\(\&\)HV parameters:**
Measurement was done in different time and at different temperature of water.

The first result is that LV temperature in all crates even for high power is lower than 30\({}^{\rm o}\) C providing that Twater \(\leq\)18\({}^{\rm o}\)C. The LV temperature is nearly independent on the LV&HV cards power but strongly depends on temperature of water.

The LV temperature for crates placed above the heat exchangers (Crate_1 and Crate_3) is lower by \(\sim\)4\({}^{\rm o}\) C than one for crates above them (Crate_0 and Crate_2).

The LV temperature in the Crate_1 and Crate_3 is higher by 7\({}^{\rm o}\) C than temperature of water.

**The air temperature outgoing from the power pack:**

Nominal power 1075W. Twater not measured

\begin{tabular}{l|c|c|c|c} \hline Artesyn PS unit & PP_0 & PP_1 & PP_2 & PP_3 \\ \hline Temperature (C) & 31/32 & 29/30 & 30/29 & 31/35 \\ \hline High power 1425W. Twater=18.13\({}^{\rm o}\)C & & & & \\ \hline Artesyn PS unit & PP_0 & PP_1 & PP_2 & PP_3 \\ \hline Temperature (C) & 31 & 29/30 & 31/30 & 31/38 \\ \hline \end{tabular} Measurement in Prague two years ago has shown that the temperature difference of air at the input and at the output of ARTESYN PS unit is a linear function of power and at maximum power of 2kW it is 10\({}^{\rm o}\) C. Therefore one can expect that for nominal power of \(\sim\)1kW the outgoing air temperature will be by 5\({}^{\rm o}\) C higher than temperature measured by PT1000 above the top Crate_0 what is confirmed by measured data (see Fig.1). Also one can expect that the outgoing temperature for high power will be only by 2\({}^{\rm o}\) C higher than one for nominal power what also is not in contradiction with data.

One NTC placed on PP_3 measured significantly higher temperature than the other one (it was not a mistake of NTC). Presumably it was due to the plastic isolated tape placed closely to the air output of that NTC.

The total current in parallel mode of operation should be shared to PS units within \(\pm\)10%. It was tested in Prague with 3 ARTESYN PS units and as one can see in Fig. 5, it was confirmed. The same measurement should be done in future with the Power Pack Monitor Card before installation of the power pack in the rack. One has to verify that Ishare interconnection of two ARTESYN shelves AFE4000 works properly since total length of Ishare wires to the mini-backplane in the Circuit Breaker Box is about 2m.

## 3. The tests of a cooling redundancy

**TEST1: Two Fan Trays are switched off**

Two fan trays have been turned off together with one ARTESYN PS unit by the circuit breaker in the rack.

Fig.6The time evolution of the power pack temperature is displayed in Fig. 6. While one ARTESYN unit is turned off, the temperature of others is increased but temperature is not higher than 35\({}^{\circ}\)C (with one exception). On the other side temperature profile is not the same for all PS units and it rises the question of a current share and current monitoring during measurement.

As first, the PP_3, Fan tray_0 and Fan tray_3 have been switched off. The LV temperature was measured after 25 minutes when the whole PS system in the rack was stabilized (see Fig.7).

Then the PP-3 with both fans has been turned on and PP_2, Fan tray_1 and Fan tray_2 were switched off (see Fig.8).

Fig.7

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

One can conclude that PS rack can work without turbine since temperature of LV cards is lower than 34\({}^{\circ}\)C at water temperature 18\({}^{\circ}\) C. It means that cooling system is well redundant.

On the other side with turbine the LV temperature is lower than 30\({}^{\circ}\) C and temperature of air outgoing from power pack is about 30\({}^{\circ}\)C. Lower temperature moderates aging of electronic components.

### TEST3: Water flow is closed

Time evolution of the LV temperature and temperature and relative humidity of air above the Crate_0is shown in the Fig.12 and Fig.13. A rapid increase of temperature in all crates was observed, in particular in the Crate_0 where temperature reached the alarm value of 50\({}^{\rm o}\) C after 30 minutes and test had to be stopped. The temperature increase of air outgoing from the power pack in average was 13\({}^{\rm o}\) C.

## 4 Conclusions

The cooling performance test of the fully loaded LV&HV power supply rack in USA15 has been carried out by Prague group in days 27 Sep-8 Oct 2005. Temperature of air above the top crate in the rack was measured by 8 sensors PT1000 and temperature of air outgoing from four ARTESYN AC/48VDC power supplies was measured by 8 sensors NTC and monitored by multi-channel ADC. LV temperature and other LV&HV parameter values have been monitored by SCT DCS (PVSS).

It was shown that the LV temperature in all crates at maximum power is lower than 30\({}^{\circ}\) C at cooling water temperature \(\leq 18^{\circ}\) C. The airflow is well isotropic in the crate tower. Temperature of the airflow at the input to the power pack is \(\sim\)25\({}^{\circ}\) C and at the output \(\sim\)30\({}^{\circ}\) C. One can conclude that cooling system consisting of two air-water heat exchangers, turbine and four fan trays is effective and sufficient for long term running of power supplies.

It was demonstrated that cooling system is redundant by switching off the turbine and by switching off two pairs of fan trays. In both cases the LV temperature increase was not higher than 4\({}^{\circ}\) C what is acceptable. It means that any swap of fan tray or a repair of turbine can be done in time when ATLAS will not take data.

Water flow and water temperature is crucial for a cooling of the PS rack. Without water flow, within 30 minutes the LV temperature of the top crate have reached 50\({}^{\circ}\) C what is the alarm limit and crate had to be turned off.

Behaviour of temperature of the outgoing air from the power pack is not fully understood and next investigation is needed, in particular of the current share in parallel mode of operation (Ishare interconnection of two ARTESYN shelves). It will be done with the Power Pack Monitor Card before installation of PS into the racks.

Note 1: Water tubes in USA15 are not isolated and water is warmed up in cavern by 2\({}^{\circ}\) C.

Note 2: For better control of LV temperatures the PVSS should have one window with the LV temperature and the input power monitor for each crate and storage of data.

Note 3: There are connectors on the top of the rack for two sensors (smoke detector and temperature sensor) monitored by the central DCS.

For better temperature control we suppose to install in the rack two NTCs. First one will be placed above the top crate and second one at the air output from the power pack and monitored by the SCT Power Pack Monitor Card.

Note 4: Before connection of cables to the crate backplane the interlock cables must be connected to each crate and tested since there was no room in the rack after connection of test cables to backplanes.

Note 5: Fan trays can be swapped from front side of the rack only. Due to it the grid will be mounted on the runners behind the fan tray as a support for 40-50 cm of the power cord and the signal cable.
