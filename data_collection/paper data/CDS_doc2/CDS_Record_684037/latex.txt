The charge fluctuations in the MDT cylindrical counters are calculated for different gas mixtures and geometrical parameters. Energy resolution values less than 15 % have been estimated in the full range of the counter. Only at radial distances 200 \(\mu\)m from the tube walls the energy resolution is affected dramatically. Futhermore by adding to the mixture a fraction of a suitable organic gas at the percentage level, the resolution increases but not significantly.

Introduction

The fluctuation of the pulse in the proportional counters - in the absence of the non-linear effects like space charge and secondary electrons - depend on the variance of the primary ionization and gas gain according to the following expression [1]:

\[(\frac{\sigma_{Q}}{\bar{Q}})^{2}=(\frac{\sigma_{n}}{\bar{n}})^{2}+\frac{1}{\bar {n}}(\frac{\sigma_{M}}{\bar{M}})^{2} \tag{1}\]

where \(\bar{n}\) is the mean number of the primary ion pairs, \(\bar{M}\) is the mean amplification factor, the so-called **gas gain**, \(\bar{Q}=\bar{n}\bar{M}\) is the mean charge and \(\sigma_{n},\sigma_{M},\sigma_{Q}\) are the standard deviations of the previous quantities.

The variance of the number of the primary ion pairs is known as:

\[(\frac{\sigma_{n}}{\bar{n}})^{2}=\frac{F}{\bar{n}} \tag{2}\]

where F is a constant characteristic of the gas, the so-called **Fano factor**. The number of primary ion pairs is determined by another specific constant of the gas, the mean expended energy for an ion-pair creation \(W_{0}=\frac{E_{m}}{\bar{n}}\), where \(E_{m}\) is the energy of the quantum to be measured.

The variance of the gas gain is given by:

\[(\frac{\sigma_{M}}{\bar{M}})^{2}=f \tag{3}\]

where \(f\) is the parameter of **Polya distribution function**. By substitution of (2) and(3) into (1) we obtain the relative deviation of pulses:

\[(\frac{\sigma_{Q}}{\bar{Q}})=\sqrt{\frac{(F+f)W_{0}}{E_{m}}} \tag{4}\]

The full width at half maximum (**FWHM**) expressed as the percentage of the maximum is the so-called **energy resolution** and in case of a Gaussian distribution it is:

\[Resolution=236\times(\frac{\sigma_{Q}}{\bar{Q}})\quad\%=236\times\sqrt{\frac{( F+f)W_{0}}{E_{m}}}\quad\% \tag{5}\]

In order to optimize the resolution we have to try to minimize the quantity \((F+f)W\).

## 2 Proposed model of the gas gain

A general formula for the first Townsend coefficient \(\alpha\) is derived [2], for uniform and non-uniform electric fields using only one parameter.

For a cylindrical proportional counter with wire radius a, tube radius b and high voltage V, the Townsend coefficient \(\alpha(r)\) was estimated as:\[\alpha(r)=C_{0}\sqrt{S_{r}}*\exp(\frac{-C_{0}\varepsilon_{\iota}}{\sqrt{S_{r}}}) \tag{6}\]

where \(S_{r}=E(r)/N\) is the reduced electric field at distance r from the anode wire, E(r) is the electric field, N is the density of the gas mixture, \(C_{0}\) is a constant that depends on the Ramsauer effective cross section and \(\varepsilon_{\iota}\) is the ionization energy of the gas. The average gas gain \(\bar{M}\) is expressed as:

\[\cdot\quad\bar{M}=\exp(\frac{2}{\varepsilon_{\iota}}NaS_{a}*e^{\frac{-C_{0} \varepsilon_{\iota}}{\sqrt{S_{r}}}}) \tag{7}\]

Table 1 shows the value of the \(C_{0}\) for two admixtures. The function \(\bar{M}\) given in eq. (7) is plotted in fig.1 and fig.2 as a function of the voltage for two admixtures and various pressures and in fig.4a for various wire diameters.

## 3 Alkazov model for the variance of gas gain

Alkazov has developed a quantitative model [3] for the calculation of the variance of gas gain as a function of the parameters of the detector for non-uniform electric fields.

For cylindrical proportional detectors - radial field - with anode wire radius \(a\) and tube radius \(b\) the variance is:

\[f=\int_{a}^{b}\frac{f_{0}[\kappa(r)]*\alpha(r)}{\bar{M}_{r}}dr \tag{8}\]

where \(\alpha(r)\) is the first Townsend coeficient and \(\bar{M}_{r}\) the gas gain at a distance r from the anode wire. The \(f_{0}(\kappa)\) is known as:

\[f_{0}[\kappa(r)]=\frac{(2\kappa(r)-1)^{2}}{4\kappa(r)-2\kappa(r)^{2}-1} \tag{9}\]

where

\[\kappa(r)=e^{-\frac{\alpha(r)}{E(r)}} \tag{10}\]

Using the eq. (6) and (7) the function \(f\) given in eq.(8) is plotted in fig.3b and fig.4b as a function of the voltage for various pressures and anode wires respectively.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Mixture & \(C_{0}\) & \(\varepsilon_{\iota}\) \\ \hline \hline \(Ar-CO_{2}-CH_{4}-N_{2}\) (90-5-3-2) & \(0.63111\times 10^{-8}\) & \(15.54\) \\ \(Ar-CO_{2}-CH_{4}-N_{2}\) (88-5-3-4) & \(0.67399\times 10^{-8}\) & \(15.51\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Values of the \(C_{0}\) are calculated from the data by SEATTLE for \(Ar-CO_{2}-CH_{4}-N_{2}\) (90-5-3-2) and \(Ar-CO_{2}-CH_{4}-N_{2}\) (88-5-3-4) admixtures.

In addition, external gas gain fluctuations could appear due to the high voltage variations \(\Delta V\), the enviroment variations - i.e. temperature T, pressure P - which affect the density of the gas \(\Delta N\) and the mechanical tolerance of the tube radius with respect to the real wire position \(\Delta G\). Fig.13 presents the effect of \(\Delta V\), \(\Delta N\) and \(\Delta G\) on the (external) gas gain variance \(f_{E}\). For a(realistic) external variation less than 1% - that means \(\Delta\)V \(\leq\) 30 V, \(\Delta\)T \(\leq\) 3 K, \(\Delta\)P \(\leq\) 30 mbar and \(\Delta\)G \(\leq\) 150 \(\mu\)m - the external variance of gas gain is \(f_{E}\)\(\leq\) 0.01. Accordingly, the \(f_{E}\) is negligible compared to the stastistical variance of gas gain \(f\) - see fig.3b and fig.4b - which is around 0.8 for gas gains higher than 100.

## 4 Variation of the primary electrons

The Fano factor indicates the variation of the primary electron number. An analysis of the Fano factor [4]-[6] for noble gases gives:

\[F=(\frac{\bar{n}_{ex}}{\bar{n}_{\iota}})\times[1+(\frac{\bar{n}_{ex}}{\bar{n}_ {\iota}})]\times(\frac{W_{ex}^{2}}{W_{0}^{2}})+0.4 \tag{11}\]

where \(\bar{n}_{\iota}\) is the mean number of ion-pairs, \(\bar{n}_{ex}\) is the mean number of excited atoms, \(W_{0}\) is the energy expended per ion pair and \(W_{ex}\) is the excitation energy of the atom. In Table 2 the Fano factor is calculated for noble gases, by substituting the characteristic constants of the gases in eq. (11).

It has been established that the released excitation energy of the noble gases is sufficient for ionization for many organic gases. If an organic gas is added, the number of the excitation molecules \(\bar{n}_{ex}\) decreases and the mean energy expended per ion pair \(W_{0}\) becames smaller. Furthermore, for a noble-organic admixture the Fano factor is determined by the following expression:

\[F_{m}=F-0.12\mu=0.17-0.12\mu \tag{12}\]

In Table 3 the Fano factor is calculated for different argon-organic admixtures.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Gas & \(W_{ex}\) & \(\varepsilon_{\iota}\) & \(W_{0}\) & F \\  & (eV) & (eV) & (eV) & \\ \hline \hline He & 19.83 & 24.58 & 42.8 & 0.17 \\ Ne & 16.54 & 21.56 & 36.2 & 0.17 \\ Ar & 11.49 & 15.76 & 26.2 & 0.17 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 5 Predicted energy resolution

The released energy of a muon (m.i.p.) in the MDT tubes is given by:

\[E_{m}=P\times Y\times 2222\qquad(\frac{eV}{cm*bar}) \tag{13}\]

where P is the pressure of the gas at T=300 Kelvin, Y is the length of the muon track for an individual drift tube.

The energy resolution is calculated numerically by substitution of eq. (8), (12), (13) into eq. (5). Fig.5b shows the predicted energy resolution for a 30 mm long track as a function of the voltage for various pressures. Fig.6 shows the calculated resolution as a function of the track position with respect to the anode wire.

## 6 Conclusion

In this note the gas gain of MDT cylindrical counters is calculated with a formula which uses only one input parameter and preditions are presented for various geometrical and gas parameters.

The variance of the gas gain is estimated by the Alkazov formula. From the present analysis the following important points are extracted:

1. The gas gain fluctuactions are small when the gas gain is low.
2. When the product of the gas density of the detector and the radius of the anode wire \(\Delta=N*a\) is low, the variance of the gas gain is smaller but not significantly.

The Fano factor depends strongly on the gas composition. The addition of a percentage fraction of a suitable organic gas - like Acetylene (\(C_{2}H_{2}\)) - to the argon increases the ionization and decreases the Fano factor and the energy expended per ion pair significantly.

Finally, the energy resolution of MDT cylindrical tubes is predicted for various pressures and different muon track positions. It is found that the resolution drops dramatically at radial distances of 200 \(\mu\)m from the tube walls.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Gas & \(\mu\) & F \\ \hline \hline \(Ar-CH_{4}\) & 0.04 & 0.17 \\ \(Ar-C_{2}H_{2}\) & 0.76 & 0.075 \\ \hline \end{tabular}.

These two notes give a quatitative model for the charge in MDT's and RPC's which it is derived from qualitative analysis of the fundamental processes. In particular, for cylindrical counters the charge is predicted also for different modes i.e. proportional,streamer and Geiger. Finally, the charge fluctuations is predicted for the MDT's in proportional mode.
