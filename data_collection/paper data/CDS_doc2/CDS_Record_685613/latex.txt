**Survey of Calorimeter Techniques**

The following table summarizes the results of a survey of current calorimeter techniques. Of course all these simplified entries have to be taken with a lot of care. They are not meant to be conclusive for any decision but rather to be indicative only for further discussions. Obviously many of the numbers or statements are known only with a very different degree of reliability. More details and references for the various techniques can be found in the transparency copies from the compilation group meetings, availables as CAL-TR-013 in the reference folders.
