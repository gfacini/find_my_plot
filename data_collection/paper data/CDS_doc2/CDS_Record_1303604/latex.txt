# ATLAS Sensitivity Prospects for Higgs Boson Production at the LHC Running at 7, 8 or 9 TeV

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

Projections for the ATLAS sensitivity to the Standard Model Higgs boson from the LHC running at centre-of-mass energies of 7, 8 and 9 TeV are reported. These studies extend our previous 7 TeV results by adding extra analysis channels and using more accurate cross-sections calculations. The \(VH\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) and \(H\rightarrow\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) improve the sensitivity at low mass, while new analyses of \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) and \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\) give major improvements above 200 GeV. There are also a range of possible integrated luminosity scenarios considered. The projections are largely derived using the ratio of cross-sections at different centre-of-mass energies.

The ATLAS experiment, with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV and using rather conservative assumptions, should have sensitivity such that Higgs boson masses between 129 and 460 GeV have at least a 50% chance of being excluded at 95% CL. If 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 8 TeV is available with analysis improvements the sensitive region ranges from 114 to over 500 GeV.

Introduction

The excellent start-up of the LHC at 7 TeV in 2010 has prompted the question of whether it might be possible to raise the energy to 8 TeV or even higher for the 2011 running period. This would entail a new commissioning period. This document presents the influence of such a change on the ATLAS sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson, which might inform such a decision. Most results are based upon a conservative analysis scenario, using cut based techniques and robust systematic error estimates. There are also more optimistic results which investigate the impact of possible analysis improvements.

The analysis is based upon an existing 7 TeV study [1], which contained the SM channels \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\) and \(H\to WW\). These are augmented here with extra channels to give a more complete view of the total sensitivity. Existing \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\)[2] and \(H\to b\bar{b}\)[3] studies at 14 TeV have been revised using cross-section rescaling, in a similar way to the previous note [1]. These channels bring important additional sensitivity at low mass. New analyses of \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) and \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\), based on 7 TeV full simulations, are also included. They suggest large gains should be possible for masses greater than 200 GeV. The most important single analysis is the \(H\to WW\) channel. It is therefore especially significant that the first data measurements [4] find backgrounds similar to those used in the simulations upon which these results are based.

The cross-section rescaling method is used to calculate sensitivities at 7, 8 and 9 TeV. A range of integrated luminosities is also investigated, from 500 pb\({}^{-1}\) to 5 fb\({}^{-1}\), to understand how the expectations depend upon this quantity. All the sensitivity studies are performed using the profile-likelihood method [2], where nuisance parameters are treated by finding the best-fit value. Limits, all at 95% CL, are extracted using a fixed \(\delta\) log \(\mathcal{L}\) threshold, but in cases of low expected event numbers either the threshold is raised to give approximate coverage or toy Monte Carlo experiments are used to obtain the limit. The \(3\sigma\) sensitivity is evaluated through the p-value of background only toy experiments. Most results are presented in terms of \(\sigma/\sigma_{SM}\), a multiple of the Standard Model cross-section at which there is sensitivity.

Additional minimum bias interactions may occur in the same bunch-crossing as the event that triggers the detector readout: this is referred to as pile-up. In addition, neutrons may fly in the ATLAS cavern for a few seconds until they are thermalised, thus producing a kind of a permanent neutron-photon gas which creates a constant rate of Compton electrons and spallation protons. This component, i.e. additional hits created by long-lived particles, is referred to as cavern background. The effects of both pile-up and cavern background have been studied for some of the channels described herein and are documented in the previous notes [1, 2, 5]. The new analyses, namely \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) and \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\) have undertaken preliminary studies of lepton identification, jet rates and missing energy under the influence of two pile-up interactions per event, as occurred at the LHC in August 2010, and no significant degradation in performance is observed.

Systematic uncertainties described in Refs. [1, 2, 3, 5] are taken into account in the estimation of the exclusion limits presented in this note. The performance of the ATLAS detector often exceeds the expectations used in these studies. For example, the jet energy scale found in Ref. [6] is known to better than the 10% assumed here and further improvements should be expected. A common correlated luminosity error of 11% is applied to all channels.

All analyses use the most accurate available calculations for the cross-sections, as detailed in Section 2. The full 7 TeV analyses presented for the first time are discussed in Section 3. Summaries of the rescaling method and its application to the previously presented Higgs boson decay modes \(WW\), \(l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\), \(\gamma\gamma\), \(\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(b\overline{b}\) can be found in Section 4. The combined results are detailed in Section 5 and some conclusions are drawn in Section 6.

Cross-sections

At the LHC, the Standard Model Higgs boson can be produced through the following four processes: (i) ggF (\(gg\to H\)): gluon fusion dominated by a heavy-quark triangular loop, (ii) VBF (\(qq^{\prime}\to qq^{\prime}H\)): vector boson fusion, (iii) \(WH/ZH\) (\(q\bar{q}\to WH/ZH\)): associated production with a vector boson, and (iv) \(t\bar{t}H\) (\(q\bar{q}/gg\to t\bar{t}H\)): production in association with a top quark pair. The last of these is kinematically suppressed at 7 TeV compared with 14 TeV and is not used in this note. The current state-of-the-art calculations of the production cross-sections of these processes are summarised in Table 1. Higher-order corrections have been calculated up to next-to-leading order (NLO) in electroweak (EW) corrections for all processes, up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD corrections (including electroweak corrections) for \(gg\to H\)[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12], up to NLO in QCD corrections for VBF [13, 14] and NNLO for \(WH/ZH\) production [15, 16]. In addition, QCD soft gluon resummations up to next-to-next-to-leading log (NNLL) are also available for the \(gg\to H\) process [17]. The QCD VBF cross-section is known up to NNLO in structure function approach [18], but the change with respect to the NLO prediction is less than, or of order, 1%. The associated production of a Higgs boson with a pair of top quarks is known at NLO [19, 20, 21]. NLO EW corrections are included as a multiplicative factor for most processes [22]. The most precise calculations of the Higgs boson production cross-sections are used for the studies summarised in this note. This is in contrast to our previous study which used the NLO cross-sections for all signal processes [1]. The change is most significant for the \(gg\to H\) process with a \(\sim 30-40\%\) increase in the cross-section.

Figure 1 shows the Standard Model Higgs boson production cross-sections as a function of the Higgs boson mass for a 7 TeV centre-of-mass energy. Table 2 summarises the Higgs boson production cross-sections for \(\sqrt{s}=7,8\) and 9 TeV for selected values of the Higgs boson mass. The values of the Standard Model input parameters used to obtain these cross-sections can be found in Ref. [23]. MSTW2008 parton density function (PDF) sets are used in all calculations. Sources of uncertainties in these cross-sections include missing higher order corrections, imprecise knowledge of the parton distribution functions and errors on the Standard Model input parameters such as \(\alpha_{s}\). These uncertainties are estimated to be \(\sim(5-10)\%\). We assign a 10% uncertainty for the gluon dominated process ggF, and a 5% uncertainty for the quark dominated processes \(VBF\) and \(W/ZH\).

Figure 2 shows the re-scaling factors used for the various Higgs boson production modes between 7 and 8 or 9 TeV. For the two largest cross-section modes the rescaling factor to 8 TeV varies between 1.25 at 110 GeV and just over 1.5 at 600 GeV. \(VH\) varies less, but still gains a factor of over 1.2 in the low-mass region where it is useful.

The Higgs boson decay branching ratios have been estimated taking into account the recently available higher order QCD and EW corrections in each Higgs boson decay mode [23]. The largest change with respect to our previous assumptions is a revision of the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) branching ratio upwards by about 10 to 14%. The values used can be found in Table 3.

Higgs boson searches suffer from backgrounds of other Standard Model processes which include \(W/Z(+\)jets), diboson \(WW/WZ/ZZ\), and \(t\bar{t}\) production. Cross-sections of these processes are calculated using the MCFM program [24]. For the inclusive \(W\) and \(Z\), the cross-sections at 14 TeV, taken from Ref. [2], are normalised with the FEWZ program [25], and the ratios of cross-sections from MCFM are used to extrapolate to other energies. The cross-sections used for different values of \(\sqrt{s}\) are summarised in Table 4. The "jets" for \(W/Z+n\) jets cross-section calculations are partons with \(p_{T}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<5.0\). The \(Z\) represents both vector boson \(Z\) and \(\gamma^{*}\) contributions. The \(Z+b\bar{b}\) cross-sections are calculated with the assumption \(m_{b}=0\) and additional requirements of \(m_{b\bar{b}}>9.24\) GeV, \(p_{T}^{b}>4.75\) GeV and \(|\eta^{b}|<6\).

Full analyses at 7 TeV of \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) and \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\)

The Higgs boson decay to \(ZZ\) presents a range of experimental signatures depending upon the decays of the two \(Z\) bosons, but most work so far has concentrated on the \(l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\) modes, where \(l=e,\mu\). This section presents cut-based analyses of two alternative \(ZZ\) decay channels, the \(llv\nu\) and \(llbb\) final states.

The cross-section before any selection cuts for the signal in all channels used in this note is given in Table 5. The cross-section for the channels discussed in this section are higher than those for the \(l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\) channel. However the backgrounds are larger and mass resolution is not as good. For high mass Higgs bosons, where the signal cross-section is low, the \(l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) channel offers the best sensitivity.

### \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\)

The \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) is a relatively clean leptonic channel, where one of the \(Z\)'s decays to \(2l\) (\(l=e,\mu\)) and the other to neutrinos. This benefits from a factor of approximately 6 in cross-section compared with \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{-}\), while the leptonic signature still offers excellent suppression of the QCD backgrounds. This channel was addressed in Refs. [26] and [27], but has not been studied for masses below 500 GeV.

The main difficulty is the unobserved \(Z\) which decays to neutrinos. While the \(p_{\rm T}\) of the system can be estimated, the mass and energy cannot. If the \(Z\) is boosted, as is the case for a heavy Higgs boson decay, this is not a major problem. However, if the Higgs boson mass is in the region of twice the \(Z\) mass, then the \(Z\) bosons are produced with low \(p_{\rm T}\), meaning that there will be little evidence for the invisibly decaying second \(Z\) boson. In this case the background from single \(Z\) production is overwhelming.

The analysis relies upon measuring the transverse mass of the Higgs candidate, defined through:

\[m_{T}^{2}\equiv\left[\sqrt{m_{Z}^{2}+|\vec{P}_{T}^{ll}|^{2}}+\sqrt{m_{Z}^{2}+|\vec {P}_{T}^{miss}|^{2}}\right]^{2}-\left[\vec{P}_{T}^{ll}+\vec{P}_{T}^{miss}\right] ^{2}. \tag{1}\]

#### 3.1.1 \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) Selection and backgrounds

The analysis uses the presence of charged leptons to provide an efficient trigger. Precisely two leptons are required, which must be oppositely charged, same flavour and with an invariant mass satisfying \(83<m_{ll}<99\) GeV.

Further selection criteria were optimised independently at each of the mass points: \(m_{H}=200\), \(300\), \(400\), \(500\) and \(600\) GeV. To obtain cut values at intermediate mass points a smooth function of \(m_{H}\) was found. There is a requirement that \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\)\(>0.40m_{H}-30\) GeV. There is also an upper limit on \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\) which depends upon the Higgs boson mass. For Higgs boson masses up to \(260\) GeV a mass-dependant lower limit is also applied to \(\Delta\phi_{ll}\). Finally there is a veto on any jet in the event having a b-tag. The value of the b tag requirement is loosened for \(m_{H}\) above \(400\) GeV. The rates of events passing these cuts are listed in Table 6.

The absolute value of the \(ZZ\) background is taken from the MC@NLO prediction. However, as this simulation includes only on-shell \(Z\) bosons, the shape of the final transverse mass distribution, after all selection cuts, is compared between MC@NLO and PYTHIA \(ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) samples, with k-factors applied to the latter. The samples are found to agree to within \(10\%\).

In addition to the irreducible Standard Model \(ZZ\) background, various other backgrounds can contribute to the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) channel. The normalisation of some of these backgrounds may be taken from data using control samples. Mostly these backgrounds are important at the lower Higgs boson masses, becoming negligible at the higher masses.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c} \hline \hline \(m_{H}\) (GeV) & 200 & 300 & 400 & 500 & 600 \\ \hline \hline \(H\to ll\nu\nu\) & 3.79 & 7.25 & 5.78 & 2.50 & 0.96 \\ \(t\bar{t}\) & 18.3 & 3.72 & 0.23 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\ \(ZZ\) & 16.0 & 14.5 & 5.54 & 2.44 & 1.12 \\ \(WW\) & 9.05 & 1.35 & 0.19 & 0.06 & 0.03 \\ \(WZ\) & 15.2 & 8.92 & 2.46 & 0.90 & 0.39 \\ Incl. \(Z\) & 69.2 & 9.87 & 1.92 & 0.39 & 0.00 \\ Incl. \(W\) & 20.6 & 4.15 & 1.38 & 0.00 & 0.00 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The \(t\bar{t}\) background can be estimated, once the \(b\)-tagging efficiency is known with sufficient precision, by reversing the b-tagging veto. Similarly, if a sideband of intermediate \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is selected it is dominated by inclusive \(Z\) events, and can be used to measure the rate of those. There are also sidebands on the \(Z\) mass, and by selecting events near, but not inside, the \(Z\) region, a sample can be selected which is enriched in \(W\) background. These can be used to establish the background composition.

#### 3.1.2 \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) Systematics

In addition to the luminosity systematic error, the following dedicated systematics are applied in the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) channel.

Signal cross-sectionThe uncertainty on the signal cross-section due to the choice of the renormalisation scale and the PDF parametrisation over the full range of mass points is between 7.8% and 8.7%. Conservatively a 10% uncertainty is taken as the normalisation uncertainty across all mass points.

Diboson cross-sectionsIn most cases background cross-sections will be determined from control regions specific to each of the channels. This is not the case for the largely irreducible Standard Model \(ZZ\) background, where the definition of an effective control region is difficult. It is assumed that this background will be taken directly from the Monte Carlo simulation. This has a systematic error of 5% from combined scale and PDF uncertainty on the NLO cross-section convoluted with a further 10% error corresponding to the maximum difference seen in the comparisons between the k-factor scaled PYTHIA and the MC@NLO results. This leads to an overall 11% error on the normalisation. In addition, the difference in the final mass distributions between the PYTHIA and MC@NLO samples (normalised to the area of the default sample) is used as shape systematic.

In the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) channel the relatively small \(WW\) and \(WZ\) backgrounds are also taken directly from the Monte Carlo with an assumed normalisation error of 11%, identical to that taken for the \(ZZ\) background.

Other Background cross-sectionsAs explained above, a normalisation uncertainty of 11% is applied to the \(ZZ\) as well as the \(WW\) and \(WZ\) backgrounds. It is assumed that the normalisation for the remaining backgrounds will be determined from data, and the systematic uncertainties applied to their normalisation are based on the expected statistics, with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), in the control region distributions discussed in Section 3.1.1. This leads to a 12% systematic uncertainty for the \(t\bar{t}\) background, a 20% uncertainty for the inclusive \(W\) background and a 3.5% uncertainty on the inclusive \(Z\) background.

\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) reconstructionThe variations in the electron, muon and jet scale and resolution, described above, are also implemented as systematic variations to the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) reconstruction.

b-tagging efficiencyAssuming most events rejected by the \(b\)-tagging veto have 2 \(b\)-jets, the estimated 5% uncertainty on a \(b\)-tagging efficiency of approximately 70%, leads to an uncertainty in the number of rejected events of between 2 and 2.5%. To apply this systematic, rejected events, weighted by either +2.5% or -2.5% are added to the accepted events.

#### 3.1.3 Results in \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\)

The distributions of the transverse mass of the \(ll+E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) system are shown in Fig. 3 for five masses between 200 and 600 GeV. At 200 GeV the distribution is clearly dominated by the background processes.

A better separation between the signal and backgrounds is obtained at the higher masses. It can also be seen that for the signal, the transverse mass distribution peaks near the Higgs boson mass.

The sensitivity associated with this channel is extracted by fitting the signal shape into the total cross-section. The sensitivity as a function of the Higgs boson mass for 1fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV can be seen in Fig. 4 (Left).

### \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\)

Candidate \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\) events are selected starting from events containing a reconstructed primary vertex consisting of at least 3 tracks which lie within \(\pm 30\) cm of the nominal interaction point along the beam direction. There must be at least two same-flavour leptons, with the invariant mass of the lepton pair forming the \(Z\) candidate lying within the range \(79<m_{ll}<103\) GeV.

The missing transverse momentum, \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\), must be less than 30 GeV, and there should be exactly

Figure 3: The transverse mass as defined in Equation 1 for signal and background events in the \(l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) analysis after all cuts for the Higgs boson masses \(m_{H}=200\), 300, 400, 500 and 600 GeV.

two \(b\)-tagged jets. Further jets are allowed in the events provided they are not identified as \(b\)-jets. The invariant mass of the two tagged \(b\)-jets is required to be in the range \(70<m_{bb}<105\) GeV. The resulting di-\(b\)-jet invariant mass is shown in Fig. 5. Finally, for Higgs boson masses \(m_{H}\geq 300\) GeV the azimuthal angle between the two jets is required to be below \(90^{\circ}\).

After the above selection, a search for \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\,\) is performed by looking for a peak above background expectation in the invariant mass of the \(lljj\) system, \(m_{lljj}\). It is found that the Higgs boson mass resolution is improved by imposing a \(Z\) mass constraint on the invariant mass of the two \(b\) jets. The resulting width of \(m_{lljj}\) is found to increase as the Higgs boson mass rises from a value of \(\approx 5\) GeV at 200 GeV to \(\approx 65\) GeV at 600 GeV due to the increasing natural width of the Higgs boson.

Figure 4: Left: The expected signal rate, as a multiple of the Standard Model rate, which could be excluded by the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) search at 7 TeV. For example, if the median line is at ‘2’ for some \(m_{H}\) then a hypothetical particle, behaving exactly like the Standard Model Higgs boson but with twice the rate, would be excluded at 95% CL in 50% of experiments. Right is the same for the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\) channel. The \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\nu\bar{\nu}\) by itself has a small region of expected exclusion. The green and yellow bands indicate the range in which the limits are expected to lie, depending upon the data.

Right: The invariant mass of the \(ll\) system for events with 2 \(b\)-tagged jets and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}<50\) GeV. The vertical dashed lines indicate the area used to define the signal region.

#### 3.2.1 Backgrounds to the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\,\) channel

The largest background is expected to arise from \(Z+\)jets, which is dominated by \(Zbb\) events with the same final state as the signal, with smaller contributions of \(Zcc\), \(Zll\), \(Zbl\), and \(Zcl\) (\(l=u,d,s,g\)). There is considerable uncertainty on the normalisation of the \(Z+\)jets background and therefore sidebands on the \(M_{jj}\) selection will be used to control it. It can be seen from Fig. 5 (left) that distributions are dominated by \(Z+\)jets with a smaller contribution from top and other processes, including the signal.

The second most important background in the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\,\) analysis is from \(t\bar{t}\) events. It is estimated from Monte Carlo, but the shape and normalisation can be checked in data by examining the sidebands of the dilepton invariant mass distribution.

The irreducible background from \(ZZ\) decays, although much smaller than that from \(Z+\)jets and \(t\bar{t}\), is important because it is difficult to distinguish from the signal, since it has the same final state and two on-shell \(Z\) bosons. It is consequently very difficult to constrain from the data in the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\,\) channel, due to the large \(Z+\)jets background and possible contamination from the signal. Hence in this analysis it is estimated from the Monte Carlo simulation.

The background contribution from multijet events where both jets fake electrons can be estimated from dijet data.

Multijet production may contribute to the background if the two electrons that form the \(Z\) arise from particles in the jets that fake the electrons or from photon conversions. These backgrounds together can be extracted from sidebands of the di-lepton mass distribution, shown in Fig. 5 (right).

Other backgrounds which were investigated but found to be negligible are \(W+\)jet, \(WZ\), and \(WW\) production. Top-pair production where both \(W\) bosons decay hadronically was also found to be negligible.

#### 3.2.2 Systematics for the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\,\) channel

The systematic errors on signal and diboson cross-sections are as outlined in Section 3.1.2. In addition, the following dedicated systematics are applied in the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\,\) channel.

b-tagging efficiencyThe 5% b-tagging efficiency uncertainty is applied as 10% normalisation uncertainty on the selected events, since 2 \(b\) tags are required.

Background cross-sectionsAs explained in Section 3.1.2 a normalisation uncertainty of 11% is applied to the \(ZZ\) backgrounds. It is assumed that the normalisation for the remaining backgrounds will be

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c} \hline \hline Sample & No \(\Delta\phi_{jj}\) Cut & \(\Delta\phi_{jj}<90^{\circ}\) \\ \hline \(m_{H}=200\) GeV & 2.03 & – \\ \(m_{H}=300\) GeV & – & 1.43 \\ \(m_{H}=400\) GeV & – & 1.86 \\ \(m_{H}=500\) GeV & – & 0.96 \\ \(m_{H}=600\) GeV & – & 0.40 \\ Z & 92.91 & 30.02 \\ Top & 4.74 & 2.14 \\ ZZ & 9.17 & 2.88 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

As discussed in Section 3.2, this cut is only applied for \(m_{H}\geq 300\) GeV. The dash (\(-\)) indicates that this number is not relevant for a particular Higgs boson mass.

determined from data and the systematic uncertainties applied to their normalisation are based on the expected statistics, with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), in the control region distributions discussed in section 3.2.1. This leads to a 20% systematic uncertainty for the \(t\bar{t}\)  and a 11% uncertainty on the inclusive \(Z\) background. In addition, the uncertainty in the shape of the \(Z\)+jets background is estimated by taking the difference between the shape of the untagged distribution and the distribution after requiring 2 tagged jets in the simulation.

#### 3.2.3 Results in \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\)

The distributions of the invariant mass of the \(lljj\) system are shown in Fig. 6 for \(m_{H}=\) 200, 300, 400, 500 and 600 GeV. For \(m_{H}<500\) GeV the signal is approximately Gaussian, with the width mainly determined by the resolution of the jets. At higher masses the signal becomes very broad, mainly due to the large width of the Higgs boson. In all cases the background is dominated by \(Z\)+jets, with significant contributions from top and \(ZZ\) production. The total number of events, after all cuts, for some of the Higgs boson mass samples as well as the backgrounds are given in Table 7 (right).

The sensitivity of this search is shown in Fig. 4 (right).

## 4 Rescaled Channels

The analyses of the \(H\to WW\), \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\), \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(H\to b\bar{b}\) channels which are used here have been published previously [1, 2, 3, 5]. The signal and background are rescaled to other energies as follows. The cross-section of the process considered is taken from the tables in Section 2 at the energy at which the analysis was fully simulated and also the desired energy. The ratio of these is used to scale the cross-section for events passing the analysis selection cuts to the new energy.

Studies of the kinematics of simulated events without a detector simulation are compared at the two energies to determine where these are significantly altered. If necessary, a correction factor for kinematic efficiency differences is applied as well in the rescaling.

### \(H\to WW\)

The search channel for the Standard Model Higgs boson at ATLAS bringing the greatest sensitivity for low integrated luminosities is \(H\to WW\). This channel benefits from the potentially large \(H\to WW\) branching ratio, the sizable \(W\) boson decay rates to leptons, and the clean lepton identification available with the ATLAS detector. If the Higgs boson has a mass between 120 and 200 GeV this channel will play a major role in its discovery.

The \(H\to WW\) results presented here are documented in Ref. [1]. In that analysis the results at 7 TeV were obtained from full analyses at 10 TeV [5] by re-scaling the cross-sections and PDF reweighting. The PDF reweighting evaluates the major kinematic effects, and while it does not account for differences in the parton shower evolution, it is generally found to compare well with re-simulation. Similar results were found, giving confidence that the rescaling can also be used to extract sensitivities at intermediate energies.

The analysis requirements are detailed in Ref. [5]; in brief two well identified and isolated leptons with transverse momenta above 15 GeV are required. Their combined invariant mass must exceed 15 GeV, and if they are of the same flavour, it must be more than 10 GeV from \(m_{Z}\). The missing transverse energy and the transverse mass must both exceed 30 GeV. Then detailed selections are made separately for events with 0, 1 or 2 accompanying jets as described in Ref. [5].

The signal cross-sections used here, as discussed in Section 2, are based on NNLO calculations for the gluon fusion process, giving somewhat larger central values than were used in our previous result. The backgrounds are calculated at NLO. The accepted signal and background cross-sections are given in Table 8.

The limit calculation in this analysis is a counting experiment in the selected signal candidates with control regions for the dominant backgrounds. The backgrounds from \(WW\), top and \(W\)+jets are all measured from control regions in the data, and there is therefore a component of the background estimate error which scales with the data sample size. Extrapolation into the signal region has errors coming from the simulated samples which are between 7% and 108% as detailed in Ref. [1]. Both of these types of error contribute to the limit calculation.

The sensitivity to the Standard Model Higgs boson with a luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV is shown in Fig. 7 and in Table 9. The results are presented in terms of the expected exclusion limit on the cross

section times branching ratio, divided by the corresponding Standard Model prediction. This channel, by itself, can exclude a significant range of Higgs boson masses even in this relatively conservative treatment. The more aggressive assumption that 10% systematic errors can be achieved on the background, which was considered in Ref. [1], is also used in the combinations presented here.

### \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\)

Experimentally, the cleanest signature for the search of the Higgs boson is its "golden" decay into four leptons: \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\), where \(l=e,\mu\). An excellent energy and momentum resolution for the reconstructed electrons and muons, respectively, leads to a narrow four-lepton invariant mass peak on top of a smooth background. The major component of the background is the irreducible \(ZZ^{(*)}\to 4l\) process. For Higgs boson masses above approximately 180 GeV the signal signature is characterised by the two on-shell \(Z\) bosons decaying into lepton pairs, which strongly suppress any reducible background contributions. Conversely, if the Higgs boson mass is below 180 GeV then one of the \(Z\) bosons is off-shell, thus decaying into low transverse momentum leptons. In this case the reducible backgrounds from \(Z+\mathrm{jets}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) are important in addition to the irreducible background and require tight lepton isolation cuts to keep their contribution well below the \(ZZ^{(*)}\) continuum. The most challenging mass region is around 160 GeV, where the branching ratio for \(H\to ZZ^{*}\) decays is suppressed owing to the opening of the phase space for the Higgs boson decay into two on-shell \(W\) bosons.

#### 4.2.1 Signal and Backgrounds to \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\)

Higgs boson production cross-sections at \(\sqrt{s}=7\,\mathrm{TeV}\) are given in Table 5. The expected yields of signal and background events at \(\sqrt{s}=7\,\mathrm{TeV}\) are summarised in Table 10. Events yields at other energies are obtained by rescaling the cross-sections.

#### 4.2.2 Expected Exclusion Limits on \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\)

The limit extraction is done by counting the number of events in a window around the Higgs boson mass under consideration. The expected exclusion limits on the Standard Model production cross-section times branching ratio in the decay channel \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\) are presented in Fig. 8 as a function of the Higgs boson mass.

The limits shown in Fig. 8 assume that the Higgs boson width is that found in the Standard Model. Above the \(ZZ\) threshold the \(HZZ\) coupling is a major contributor to the Higgs boson width and the measured width is dominated by the natural width and not by experimental resolution. In this region the hypothetical mechanism which increases the \(ZZ\) rate may invalidate the limits obtained.

With an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV, the Standard Model Higgs boson is not expected to be excluded at the quoted confidence level for any mass value in the \(H\to ZZ^{(*)}\to l^{+}l^{-}l^{+}l^{-}\) channel alone. The analysis is most sensitive for a Standard Model Higgs boson mass of about 200 GeV, where an

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{l|c c c c c c c c} \hline \hline \(M_{H}\)(GeV) & 120 & 130 & 140 & 150 & 165 & 170 & 180 & 190 \\ \hline SM \(ZZ\) & 0.093 & 0.097 & 0.086 & 0.092 & 0.125 & 0.152 & 0.388 & 1.012 \\ top \& \(Z\)+jets & 0.012 & 0.009 & 0.008 & 0.006 & 0.004 & 0.004 & 0.003 & 0.003 \\ \hline Total background & 0.105 & 0.106 & 0.094 & 0.098 & 0.129 & 0.156 & 0.391 & 1.015 \\ Signal & 0.152 & 0.455 & 0.840 & 0.995 & 0.258 & 0.271 & 0.651 & 2.105 \\ \hline \hline \(M_{H}\)(GeV) & 200 & 220 & 240 & 260 & 300 & 400 & 500 & 600 \\ \hline SM \(ZZ\) & 1.33 & 1.21 & 0.94 & 0.92 & 0.75 & 0.49 & 0.51 & 0.40 \\ Signal & 2.25 & 2.04 & 1.75 & 1.51 & 1.24 & 0.95 & 0.42 & 0.18 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

upper bound in the cross-section times branching ratio of \(1.3\times(\sigma_{H}\times\mathcal{B}_{H\to 4l})_{SM}\) is expected. Systematic uncertainties are found to have a small effect on the exclusion reach, which is predominantly affected by the statistical fluctuations on the number of observed background events.

The exclusion limits shown are based on a conservative analysis, on top of which a number of enhancements can be implemented: using the shape information in the reconstructed Higgs boson candidate mass distribution; implementing multivariate techniques, etc. These are expected to improve substantially the sensitivity of the analysis. Using the shape information alone gives an improvement equivalent to a 10 - 15% signal increase for the same background level and this improvement is used for the more aggressive scenario.

### \(H\to\gamma\gamma\)

The search for the Higgs boson via the \(\gamma\gamma\) decay mode is unchanged with respect to the analysis described in Ref. [1], with the exception that the NNLO signal cross-sections discussed in Section 2 are used instead of NLO ones. The expected numbers of signal and background events with \(\mathcal{L}=1\) fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at 7 TeV are summarised in Table 12. The background events are those estimated in Ref. [1]. It must be emphasised that this is a deliberately simple and robust analysis, using only the reconstructed di-photon

The green and yellow bands indicate the range in which the limits are expected to lie, depending upon the data. Variation of the background estimate in the toy Monte Carlo trials changes the limit calculated when zero events are observed. This gives rise to narrow downward-fluctuation band even when very few background events are expected.

mass as a discriminating variable, intended to minimise the impact of systematic uncertainties.

To estimate the analysis sensitivity the profile likelihood method is used [2]. The expected exclusion is set using the signal-plus-background probability only. The background fluctuation bands at \(\pm 1\) and \(2\sigma\) are calculated using the estimator value for background only toy experiments. The expected exclusion limits for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) are shown in Fig. 9. Systematic uncertainties are discussed in Ref. [1], but in summary the energy resolution has the non-stochastic term varied by 50% and the signal efficiency, which will be measured in data, by 1%. The Higgs boson cross-sections that are expected to be excluded at 95% CL are listed in Table 13. The predictions obtained are significantly better than the current limits from each Tevatron experiment [28, 29] in this channel.

A significantly greater sensitivity can be achieved when considering more advanced analysis features. In particular the use of the \(p_{T}\) and \(cos\theta^{*}\) of the di-photon pair as discriminating variables and separating the events in categories in terms of numbers of jets, photon acceptance regions with different energy resolutions and photon conversions. These improvements, documented in Ref. [2], have not been repeated at 7 TeV. However, the more aggressive analysis assumes a sensitivity gain of 50%, which would arise if more advanced analysis features were included.

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c} \hline \hline \(M_{H}\) ( GeV) & 110 & 115 & 120 & 130 & 140 \\ Signal & 20.1 & 20.4 & 20.7 & 18.5 & 14.1 \\ \hline \hline \(\gamma\gamma\) & & & 5540 & & \\ \(\gamma j\) & & & 2500 & & \\ \(jj\) & & & 360 & & \\ Drell Yan & & & 90 & & \\ \hline Total background & & & 8490 & & \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

The green and yellow bands represent the range in which the limit is expected to lie, depending upon the data.

### Vbf \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\)

At low masses the Higgs boson has a sizable decay rate to tau pairs, approximately 8% at 100 GeV and falling above that mass. This, combined with the ability to trigger the final state particles, allows a powerful search in this channel. This potential is most easily realised in the VBF production mode, which gave the best ATLAS expected sensitivity for a low mass Higgs boson at 14 TeV [2]. Here the expected performance of that search is extrapolated to lower energies.

Important in this analysis is the distinctive signature of two forward jets which can be tagged. Characteristic of the VBF process, in addition to the forward jets, is the suppresion of hadronic activity in the central region due to the absence of colour exchange between the initial and the final state quarks. The analysis benefits from the rapidity gap between those jets that allows observation of the Higgs boson decay products in an isolated environment and can also be used to distinguish VBF events from the background QCD processes which often generate central jets. ATLAS has measured in early data the probability of associating to a hard process an extra jet of 20 GeV \(p_{\rm T}\) or more as a result of pile-up [4]. That rate is below 1% for 5 pile-up vertices if tracking information is used to validate the jets, and as the expected pile-up is of this order additional jets are not expected to be a significant problem. However, the affect on the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) resolution has not been assesed.

#### 4.4.1 \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to ll+E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(lh+E_{T}^{miss}\)

For the signal (\(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to ll+E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to lh+E_{T}^{miss}\), where \(l=e,\mu\) and \(h\)=hadronically decaying \(\tau\) ), the results at 14 TeV [2] were used to extract the efficiency given in Table 14 and the new cross-section computation at NLO [QCD+EW] was used, while in Ref. [2] only the NLO QCD correction was applied. At 14 TeV, the new cross-section for \(m_{H}=120\) GeV is 5% lower because of the negative EW corrections. The new branching ratio values for \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) given in Table 3 are, for example, 2.5% higher at \(m_{H}=120\) GeV. Estimates of the cross-section for the signal and for different Higgs boson masses are given in Table 16, reporting only candidates where \(m_{\tau^{+}\tau^{-}}\) is within 15 GeV of the Higgs boson mass under consideration.

Variations in the signal efficiency due to the varied kinematics were estimated using the SHERPA [30] generator to compare kinematics distributions. The largest effect observed is a 10% reduction in the Higgs candidate \(p_{\rm T}\), but this is offset by increased efficiency of the jet veto and more central events. No shift is applied, but a 20% systematic error is applied to account for these effects.

#### 4.4.2 Backgrounds to \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to ll+E_{T}^{miss}\) and \(lh+E_{T}^{miss}\)

The results at 14 TeV [2] also provided the efficiency given in Table 15 for the reducible backgrounds (\(W(\to l\nu)+n\) jets, \(Z(\to ll)+n\) jets, \(\tilde{t}\) and dibosons) and for the irreducible background, \(Z(\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-})+n\) jets [QCD and EW]. For \(\tilde{t}\) and the dibosons processes the new cross-section calculation made with MCFM [24] was used. For the \(Z(\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-})+n\) jets [QCD], \(Z(\to ll)+n\) jets and \(W(\to l\nu)+n\) jets backgrounds the renormalised ALPGEN [31] cross-sections by FEWZ [25] were rescaled from 14 TeV to

lower energies using MCFM [24] cross-section ratio between 14 TeV and the other centre-of-mass energy (see Section 2 for details). For \(Z(\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-})+n\) jets [EW] the cross-sections were computed with SHERPA [30] The background cross-section estimation is done for a mass window of \(m_{H}=120\pm 15\) GeV. A scaling factor to get the background composition for the different Higgs boson mass ranges that are given in Table 17 was extracted from Ref. [2]. The scaling factor is the ratio of the cross-section of \(Z(\to ll,\tau\tau)\) +n jets and other backgrounds (\(W(\to l\nu)\), \(t\bar{t}\) and dibosons) in a mass window of \(m_{H}\pm 15\) GeV and a mass window of \(m_{H}=120\pm 15\) GeV

The estimation of the cross-section for the background and for different Higgs boson masses is given in Table 16 for a mass window of \(m_{H}-15\) GeV \(\leq m_{\tau^{+}\tau^{-}}\leq m_{H}+15\) GeV.

#### 4.4.3 Expected Exclusion Limits on \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\to ll\) and \(lh\)

The limit extraction is done as number counting experiment. The systematic errors include 30% uncertainty on the signal efficiency (dominated by the jet energy scale), 20% on the \(Z\) background and 50% for QCD and \(W\)+ jets (mainly from Monte Carlo uncertainties) [2]. This is in addition to the luminosity uncertainty of 11% which is 100% correlated across signal, backgrounds, and also across different channels. As the expected number of events is small, the \(\chi^{2}\) approximation to the likelihood ratio is poor, and so the 95% CL exclusion limits are evaluated at 5% false-exclusion rate by numerical integration. The expected sensitivity for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV is shown in Fig. 10 and in Table 18. A 115 GeV Higgs boson produced at 6.5 times the Standard Model rate could be excluded by this channel alone. The impact of pileup on the \(E_{T}^{miss}\) measurement may degrade this.

It is expected that a re-optimisation of the selections for 7 TeV would bring improvements, up to a 30% enhancement in the sensitivity may be achieved. As a result, a 30% increase in the VBF \(H\to\tau\tau\) signal rate is assumed in our aggressive scenario.

### \(H\to b\bar{b}\)

The \(b\bar{b}\) mode dominates Standard Model Higgs boson decay rates up to about 135 GeV, but is a difficult decay mode to search for owing to the overwhelming QCD \(b\bar{b}\) production at LHC. This has a cross-section of order 100 \(\mu\)b\({}^{-1}\), more than six orders of magnitude greater than the Higgs boson cross-sections.

This means that an inclusive \(H\to b\bar{b}\) signal is extremely hard to distinguish and the associated modes \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(VH\) (V=\(W\) or \(Z\)) are more promising. At the time of writing, results from \(t\bar{t}H\) are not available, so this section concentrates on the \(VH\) mode. This channel suffers from significant backgrounds of \(Vb\bar{b}\) events, but these have a softer \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum than the signal. At 14 TeV, boosted \(VH\) analyses [32, 3] are used to increase the Higgs boson signal to background ratio (compared to the inclusive analyses [26]), but at a large cost in accepted cross-section.

The analyses used here were not optimised for 7 TeV, but are simply rescaled from 14 TeV. The requirement of a 200 GeV \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) for the Higgs boson candidate came from the need to reduce \(Vbb\) and \(t\bar{t}\) backgrounds, which have lower rates at 7 TeV.

#### 4.5.1 \(VH\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) signal and background cross-sections

The signal and background numbers are taken from Ref. [3] at 14 TeV and rescaled to lower energies using the cross-sections given in Section 2. Two extra effects need to be allowed for in this case. Firstly, that analysis presented results in the two \(ZH\) channels only at a fixed Higgs boson mass: 120 GeV. This note presents sensitivity as a function of the Higgs boson mass and therefore results are needed at other signal masses. For Higgs boson masses of 115 and 130 GeV in these channels background yields were calculated from the original samples by moving the mass window. Signal yields were calculated by scaling the 120 GeV signal by the ratio of cross-sections and branching ratios. This approach was found to produce changes in significance compatible with those seen in the full analysis of the \(WH\) channel. The accepted signal and background events are shown along with the original results, in Table 19.

Secondly, the kinematics of the selection, which requires the Higgs boson candidate to have a \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) above 200 GeV, introduces biases in the cross-section rescaling if the total cross-sections are used. To account for this, kinematic factors showing the additional cross-section reduction at lower energy coming largely from the softer \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectra were measured using Rivet [33] to generate events in various channels with the 14 TeV MC 2008 ATLAS tune [34] of Herwig 6.510 [35]. The events had jets reconstructed using the Cambridge/Aachen [3] algorithm with \(R\)-parameter 1.2. The number of jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) above 200 GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) was counted. The relative fractions selected at different energies are shown in Table 20. Only certain example backgrounds were tested. As can be seen, the results for the backgrounds

are compatible within the 5% statistical errors. Therefore sub-dominant backgrounds are taken to follow the same pattern. Background involving two vector bosons are assumed to scale like \(W\)+jets and \(Wt\) is assumed to scale like \(\tilde{t}\).

The final signal and background numbers of events are given in Table 21.

#### 4.5.2 \(Vh\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) systematics

In the 14 TeV analysis [3], the significance was estimated based on event counting. The most important systematic in this case, the uncertainty on the background cross-section, was the only one considered. The various background samples were divided into three groups, consisting primarily of \(W\)+jets, \(Z\)+jets and \(\tilde{t}\). The cross-section of each of these was assigned a Gaussian uncertainty, varying independently but correlated across the three \(VH\) channels.

At 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) the background estimation will have to use control samples from relaxing such things as \(b\)-tagging requirements, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cuts or leptonic selections. Measurements of these should allow us to build confidence in our modelling of the background. In this note, it is assumed that we will understand our backgrounds to the 20% level. Furthermore, a systematic error at the same level was applied to the signal efficiency. Background precisions twice as good are reported in related Tevatron analyses [36, 37].

The luminosity error of 11% is also included.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c c} \hline \hline \(\sqrt{s}\) change (TeV) & \(WH\) & \(ZH\) & \(W\)+jets & \(Z\)+jets & \(\tilde{t}\) \\ \hline \hline

#### 4.5.3 \(Vh,h\to b\bar{b}\) results

As the expected number of events is small, the \(\chi^{2}\) approximation to the likelihood ratio is poor, and so the 95% CL exclusion limits are evaluated at 5% false-exclusion rate by numerical integration. The sensitivity of this channel at 7 TeV is shown in Fig. 11 and in Table 22. At 7 TeV with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) a 115 GeV Higgs boson with a production rate 5.8 times the Standard Model value can be excluded at 95% CL.

Preliminary studies of \(t\bar{t}H\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) at 7 TeV suggest that it has a sensitivity about 40% of that found in the \(VH\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\). Furthermore, re-optimising the selections in the \(VH\) channel which were intended

for 14 TeV would bring enhancements. Considering both these possibilities, a 30% enhancement in the \(H\to b\bar{b}\) sensitivity is assumed in our aggressive scenario and included by scaling the \(VH\), \(H\to b\bar{b}\) rate.

## 5 Combination

The results of the individual analyses are combined using the profile likelihood method [2], as was used in a previous note on Higgs boson sensitivity [1]. That study compared the expected limits found using the profile likelihood and the \(CL_{s}\) method [38] in the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\) channel, and the former gave limits some 15% smaller.

All analysis channels are included where they provide results. These are then fitted to the optimal values of the nuisance parameters, and the profile likelihood value is used to extract the limits. In order to improve coverage the limits are not quoted at a \(\delta\log\mathcal{L}\) of 1.35, corresponding to a Gaussian regime, but the limit is set at 1.7 as a more conservative approximation. The \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\bar{\nu}\bar{\nu}\) and \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\) fits are done to distributions while the other channels are treated as number counting experiments here.

The combination of all channels with 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV is shown in Fig. 12 in terms of the expected upper limit which might be set.

The planned 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV allows a median expectation of exclusion of the SM Higgs boson between 129 GeV and 460 GeV. There is however considerable expected spread in the observations and reasonable fluctuations of around 2 \(\sigma\) could allow or prevent exclusion at any mass in the range considered.

The individual channel contributions can also be seen. In the region near 115 GeV, the \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(H\to b\bar{b}\) channels contribute comparably to the \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), however this last is clearly the most sensitive. The \(H\to WW\) dominates the region up to 200 GeV and offers the best single-channel sensitivity, while from 200 GeV and up only the \(H\to ZZ\) modes have been used, and they benefit, compared with our previous results, by the addition of the \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}\bar{\nu}\bar{\nu}\) and \(H\to ZZ\to l^{+}l^{-}b\bar{b}\) decay modes.

At each mass, every channel giving reporting on it is used. The plot at the bottom is the same as the top except truncated to 200 GeV. The green and yellow bands indicate the range in which we expect the limit will lie, depending upon the data.

Figure 13 (left) shows the effect of increasing the integrated luminosity from 0.5 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV. The lower expected exclusion limit reduces by about 7 GeV with each doubling of the integrated luminosity, meeting the LEP bound for 5 fb\({}^{-1}\). The 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) line can be taken as indicative of what might be achieved by combining the results of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) analysed by each of ATLAS and CMS.

The 3\(\sigma\) sensitivity is illustrated in Fig. 13 (right). There is a region, extending from Higgs boson masses of 139 to 180 GeV, where 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) would be expected to lead to evidence at this level. If 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) becomes available then this region extends down to 131 GeV, and in addition there is close to 50% chance of 3\(\sigma\) evidence for a Higgs boson with mass between 200 and 430 GeV.

The effect of raising the collision energy to 8 or 9 TeV is shown in Fig. 14, where results at 1 and 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) are contrasted. The expected excluded region for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 8 TeV is 127 to 525 GeV. There is a small but significant increase in sensitivity at low mass, while there is a particularly clear gain at the upper mass limit, because of the increased phase-space for the production of heavy objects. This effect can be seen in the bottom plot.

The aggressive analyses which have been mentioned with each channel summarise the potential to make more sensitive searches if various conditions can be met. This has been included by applying scaling factors to the sensitivity of some of the channels (15% for \(H\to ZZ\), 50% for \(H\to\gamma\gamma\), and 30% for each of \(H\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) and \(H\to b\bar{b}\).) The \(H\to WW\) channel has had the systematics decreased to 10% as described in Ref. [1]. The expected limits in this optimistic scenario using 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 8 TeV are also shown in Fig. 14, where it can be seen that under these assumptions there is at least 50% exclusion probability from the LEP bound to well over 500 GeV.

The amount of integrated luminosity at 8 or 9 TeV which gives the same median sensitivity as 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV as a function of Higgs boson mass is shown in Fig 15. This is estimated by first fitting the gain in sensitivity from 1 to 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) to a function of the form \(\sigma\propto 1/\mathcal{L}^{\alpha}\). The exponent \(\alpha\) would be 0.5 in a background dominated regime with no systematics. In fact it varies from 0.6 to 0.3, with the minimum at 170 GeV where the systematic errors are important. This expression is used to find the integrated luminosity at 8 or 9 TeV which matches the sensitivity seen for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV. For masses below 200 GeV approximately 750 to 800 pb\({}^{-1}\) at 8 TeV or 600 to 650 pb\({}^{-1}\) at 9 TeV is as powerful as 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV. The required integrated luminosity is lower for higher mass Higgs bosons.

The top right also shows the impact of an aggressive analysis strategy explained in the text. Bottom plot shows the 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) result over the full mass range. Public results from LEP [39] and the Tevatron [38] are shown for comparison.

Conclusions

The estimated ATLAS sensitivity to the Standard Model Higgs boson using between 0.5 and 5 fb\({}^{-1}\) of LHC data at 7, 8 and 9 TeV have been presented. At a running energy of 8 TeV, 750 to 800 pb\({}^{-1}\) gives approximately the same exclusion sensitivity for a low-mass Higgs boson as 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV.

The expected exclusion range is 129 to 460 GeV if 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 7 TeV is available. A factor two increase in the integrated luminosity would lower the lower sensitivity bound by some 7 GeV, while the same amount of data delivered at 8 TeV instead would extend the range by only around 2.5 GeV. Evidence at the 3\(\sigma\) level could be found in a limited range from 1 fb\({}^{-1}\), but if two experiments like ATLAS were combined there would be a reasonable chance of 3\(\sigma\) evidence over most of the mass range from 131 to 430 GeV.

If 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) at 8 TeV is collected, and expected or planned analysis improvements are implemented, then the median exclusion region covers a range of Higgs boson masses from 114 to well over 500 GeV. These results improve over our previous studies [1] through the inclusion of more search modes and updated theoretical cross-section calculations. Further analysis channels are under development.
