# Spin Correlation Summary Figures from the LHCTopWG

The ATLAS Collaboration

This document presents several summary figures from the LHCTopWG for the \(\Delta\phi(\ell^{+},\ell^{-})\) observable in \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation measurements from ATLAS and CMS using 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of 13 TeV proton-proton data.

## 1 Introduction

ATLAS and CMS have both published results measuring observables sensitive to spin correlation in top quark pair events using 36.1 fb\({}^{-1}\) of proton-proton collision data at a centre of mass energy of 13 TeV [1, 2]. Both analyses utilise the \(\Delta\phi(\ell^{+},\ell^{-})\) observable: the difference in azimuthal angle between two charged leptons. The purpose of this PUB note is to present several summary figures which combine the results of both papers. No additions, improvements, or changes are introduced to either the ATLAS or CMS result and the data from both experiments are not combined into a single curve.

Two figures are presented. Figure 1 shows the ATLAS and CMS data unfolded to parton-level in the full phase-space and normalised by the total cross-section. The primary Monte Carlo (MC) simulation samples which are used to correct the data for detector effects for each experiment are also presented. Both samples use the Powheg-Box program interfaced to Pythia8. The data are also compared to the most precise theory prediction currently available at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD [3]. Figure 2 shows the same unfolded ATLAS and CMS data compared to all of the available MC simulation setups from both experiments.

Figure 1: ATLAS and CMS data compared to Powheg-Box + Pythia8 Monte Carlo Simulation from ATLAS and CMS as well as calculations at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in perturbative QCD. The ATLAS and CMS data are corrected to parton level using Iterative Bayesian Unfolding and regularised TUnfold, respectively.

## 3 Results

Figure 2: ATLAS and CMS data compared to Monte Carlo Simulation samples from the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. The ratio is with respect to Powheg-Box + Pythia8 from ATLAS (Pwg+P8). The ATLAS and CMS data are corrected to parton level using Iterative Bayesian Unfolding and regularised TUnfold, respectively.
