# Prospects for New Physics in Higgs Couplings Studies with the ATLAS Detector at the HL-LHC

The ATLAS Collaboration

###### Abstract

The ATLAS experiment at the LHC determines the couplings of the Higgs boson to other particles using the combination of measurements from multiple production and decay channels. The expected precision with which these couplings can be measured at the High-Luminosity LHC has been estimated elsewhere using parametrized acceptances, efficiencies, and resolutions to approximate the expected detector performance with the upgraded detector. Expected constraints on a non-standard mass scaling of the couplings, as well as models with an additional electroweak singlet, an additional electroweak doublet (two-Higgs-doublet model), a composite Higgs boson, a simplified Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), and a Higgs portal to dark matter, are derived here using the estimated precision on the coupling measurements with 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. The sensitivity to new phenomena is significantly enhanced at the High-Luminosity LHC compared to the corresponding sensitivities at lower integrated luminosities.

Introduction

The ATLAS and CMS Collaborations at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) announced the discovery of a Higgs-like boson in the summer of 2012 [1, 2]. Since then, both collaborations have measured the mass of the particle to be approximately 125 GeV [3, 4]. Studies of its spin and parity have found it to be compatible with a \(J^{P}=0^{+}\) state in bosonic decays [5, 6, 7]. Combined coupling fits of the measured production and decay rates within the framework of the Standard Model (SM) have found no significant deviation from the SM expectations [4, 8]. These results strongly suggest that the newly-discovered particle is indeed a Higgs boson and that a non-zero vacuum expectation value of a Higgs doublet is responsible for electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking [9, 10, 11]. A crucial question is whether there is only one Higgs doublet, as postulated by the SM, or whether the Higgs sector is modified with respect to the SM, for example with a second doublet leading to more than one Higgs boson of which one has SM-like properties, as predicted in many beyond-Standard-Model (BSM) theories. The "hierarchy problem" regarding the naturalness of the Higgs boson mass, the nature of dark matter, and other open questions that the SM is not able to answer also motivate the possible existence of additional new particles and interactions.

To better study the Higgs sector as well as to accomplish other physics goals, the LHC is being upgraded from its current center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV towards its design energy of 14 TeV during "Long Shutdown 1" in 2013-2014. After this Phase 0 upgrade, an instantaneous luminosity of \(1\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\) is expected to be achieved, resulting in an average number of \(pp\) interactions per bunch crossing, \(\mu\), of approximately 20 (referred to as "pile-up"). The Phase 1 upgrade [12] during "Long Shutdown 2" in 2018 will increase the instantaneous luminosity to above \(2\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), with the pile-up increasing to \(\mu\sim 55\). This will allow the collection of about 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity by about 2022. A Phase 2 upgrade [13] has been proposed that would enable High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) operation at a nominal leveled instantaneous luminosity of \(5\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\) s\({}^{-1}\), allowing the collection of about 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data by 2030 with \(\mu\sim 140\).

This note presents an update of the analyses in Ref. [14]. The projections for some decay channels, \(h\to Z\gamma\)[15] and \(Vh/t\bar{t}h\to\gamma\gamma\)[16], have been revised. In addition, the prospects for the \(Vh\to b\bar{b}\) channel have been explored [17]. The expected sensitivity to various models of BSM phenomena obtained indirectly from the Higgs coupling measurements is characterized assuming the measured couplings have the values expected in the SM.

In Ref. [18], a simultaneous fit of multiple production and decay rates to be measured is used to determine the expected precision of measurements of the couplings of the Higgs boson to other SM particles with 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV. A parametrized response is used to model the effects of detector acceptances, efficiencies, and resolutions, where the detector performance is extrapolated to the high pile-up conditions expected at higher instantaneous luminosities as described in detail in Refs. [19, 20]. The production and decay channels considered are summarized in Sec. 2 and described in detail in Ref. [18]. The statistical procedures and treatment of systematic uncertainties are the same as those used in combined coupling measurements with the current 7-8 TeV data [8, 21].

The scaling of the couplings with mass is probed in Sec. 3. The rate measurements are used to derive expected limits on model parameters in five representative classes of models: Higgs boson compositeness in Sec. 4, an additional electroweak singlet in Sec. 5, an additional electroweak doublet (two-Higgs-doublet model) in Sec. 6, a simplified Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) in Sec. 7, and a Higgs portal to dark matter in Sec. 8. These models modify the couplings of the Higgs boson to fermions and vector bosons by functions of the parameters of the BSM theory. In all cases, it is assumed that the modifications of the couplings do not change the Higgs boson production or decay kinematics appreciably, so that the expected rate of any given process can be obtained through a simple rescaling of the SM couplings. Current and future direct searches for additional Higgs bosons and other new phenomena would provide additional constraints on these models, but are not used in the current analysis.

## 2 Input Channels

The luminosity of the HL-LHC would provide substantially improved statistical precision for already established channels and allow rare Higgs boson production and decay modes to be studied. The following decay channels have been included as described in Ref. [18], with each being split into categories sensitive to different production modes:

* \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) in the inclusive, 0-jet, 1-jet, and 2-jet final states, the last with a vector-boson fusion (VBF) selection, as well as 1- and 2-lepton selections with other criteria to separate the \(Wh\), \(Zh\), and \(t\bar{t}h\) production modes [16, 22]
* \(h\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) separated into categories sensitive to ggF, VBF, \(Zh/Wh\), and \(t\bar{t}h\) production [22]
* \(h\to WW^{*}\to\ell\nu\,\ell\nu\) in the 0-jet, 1-jet, and 2-jet final states, the last with a VBF selection [22]
* \(h\to Z\gamma,Z\to\ell\ell\) in inclusive and 2-jet (VBF) final states [15]
* \(h\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\) in the 2-jet final state with a VBF selection [22]
* \(h\to\mu\mu\) in inclusive and \(t\bar{t}h\) final states [22]
* \(h\to b\bar{b}\) with one-lepton and two-lepton selections to identify \(Wh\) and \(Zh\) production respectively [17]

In each channel, the trigger and the photon and lepton requirements are adjusted to keep misidentification rates at an acceptable level in the high-luminosity environment. For the VBF jet selection, the cuts are tightened to reduce the expected fake rate induced by pileup [19].

Differential measurements of Higgs production, for example of the Higgs boson transverse momentum and rapidity [23, 24], are not included here and will further decrease the uncertainties in the coupling measurements. The \(tth\) process is expected to be measured in additional decay channels to those studied here, such as \(h\to b\bar{b}\). These and other improvements are expected to further improve the Higgs coupling precision attained in the future.

## 3 Mass Scaling of Couplings

The expected rate measurements in different channels are used to determine the sensitivity to the mass scaling of the Higgs boson couplings to other particles. The Higgs boson mass is assumed to be \(m_{h}=125.0\) GeV. The couplings are parametrized using scale factors denoted \(\kappa_{i}\), which are defined as the ratios between the couplings and their corresponding SM values. The expected precision of the scale factors for the couplings of the Higgs boson to the \(Z\) boson, \(W\) boson, top quark, bottom quark, \(\tau\) lepton, and muon are given in Model 6 of Table 1.

The coupling scale factors to different species of fermions and vector bosons, respectively, are expressed in terms of a mass scaling parameter \(\epsilon\) and a "vacuum expectation value" parameter \(M\)[25]:

\[\begin{array}{rcl}\kappa_{f,i}=&v\frac{m_{f,i}^{\epsilon}}{M^{1+\epsilon}}\\ \kappa_{V,j}=&v\frac{m_{V,j}^{\epsilon}}{M^{1+\epsilon\epsilon}},\end{array} \tag{1}\]

where \(v\approx 246\) GeV is the vacuum expectation value in the SM, \(m_{f,i}\) denotes the mass of each fermion species (indexed \(i\)), and \(m_{V,j}\) denotes each vector boson mass (indexed \(j\)). The mass scaling of the couplings, and the vacuum expectation value, of the SM are recovered with parameter values \(\epsilon=0\) and \(M=v\), which produce \(\kappa_{f,i}=\kappa_{V,j}=1\).

The production and decay rates are modified from their SM expectations accordingly. For example, assuming the narrow-width approximation [26, 27], the rate for the process \(gg\to h\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\) relative to the SM prediction can be parametrized [28] as:

\[\mu=\ \ \ \frac{\sigma\times\text{BR}}{(\sigma\times\text{BR})_{\text{SM}}}= \ \ \frac{\kappa_{g}^{2}\kappa_{Z}^{2}}{\kappa_{h}^{2}}. \tag{2}\]

Here \(\kappa_{g}\) is the scale factor for the loop-induced coupling to the gluon through the top and bottom quarks, where both the top and bottom couplings are scaled by \(\kappa_{f}\), and \(\kappa_{Z}\) is the coupling scale factor for the \(Z\) boson. The scale factor for the total width of the Higgs boson, \(\kappa_{h}^{2}\), is calculated as a squared effective coupling scale factor. It is defined as the sum of squared coupling scale factors for all decay modes, \(\kappa_{i}^{2}\), each weighted by the corresponding SM branching ratio:

\[\kappa_{h}^{2} = \sum_{\begin{subarray}{c}jj=\text{WW, ZZ, }b\bar{b},\ \tau^{+}\tau^{+},\\ \gamma_{i},\text{ZY, }\text{gg, }\text{gt},\text{ }\text{ct},\text{ }\text{c}\bar{c},\text{ s}\bar{s},\text{ }\mu^{+}\mu^{+}\end{subarray}}\]

Figure 1: Two-dimensional expected confidence intervals as a function of the mass scaling factor, \(\epsilon\), and the vacuum expectation value parameter, \(M\). The 95% CL (\(2\sigma\)) regions are shown assuming a SM Higgs boson. They are indicated for 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, with and without inclusion of theory uncertainties. The SM expectation is indicated as +.

where \(\sigma^{ij}_{\rm ggh}\), \(\Gamma^{ij}_{\gamma\gamma}\), \(\Gamma^{ij}_{Z_{\gamma}}\) and \(\Gamma^{\rm SM}_{ff}\) are theoretically predicted [28]. It is assumed that there are no new production and decay modes beyond those in the SM. Production or decays through loops are resolved in terms of the contributing particles in the loops, assuming only contributions from SM particles. For example, the \(W\) boson provides the dominant contribution, followed by the top quark, to the \(h\to\gamma\gamma\) decay, such that the effective coupling scale factor \(\kappa_{\gamma}\) is given by:

\[\kappa_{\gamma}^{2}(\kappa_{\rm b},\kappa_{\rm t},\kappa_{\rm t}, \kappa_{\rm W}) = \frac{\sum_{i,j}\kappa_{i}\kappa_{j}\cdot\Gamma^{ij}_{\gamma\gamma}} {\sum_{i,j}\Gamma^{ij}_{\gamma\gamma}} \tag{3}\]

where the negative interference between the \(W\) and top loops, as well as the contributions from other charged particles in the loops, are accounted for. Similarly, for the loop-induced \(h\to Z\gamma\) and \(\rm gg\to h\) processes the effective coupling scale factors are given by:

\[\kappa_{(Z\gamma)}^{2}(\kappa_{\rm b},\kappa_{\rm t},\kappa_{\rm t },\kappa_{\rm W}) = \frac{\sum_{i,j}\kappa_{i}\kappa_{j}\cdot\Gamma^{ij}_{Z\gamma}}{ \sum_{i,j}\Gamma^{ij}_{Z\gamma}} \tag{4}\]

\[\kappa_{\rm g}^{2}(\kappa_{\rm b},\kappa_{\rm t}) = \frac{\kappa_{\rm t}^{2}\cdot\sigma^{\rm tt}_{\rm ggh}+\kappa_{\rm b }^{2}\cdot\sigma^{\rm bb}_{\rm ggh}+\kappa_{\rm t}\kappa_{\rm b}\cdot\sigma^{ \rm tb}_{\rm ggh}}{\sigma^{\rm tt}_{\rm ggh}+\sigma^{\rm bb}_{\rm ggh}+\sigma^ {\rm tb}_{\rm ggh}} \tag{5}\]

Combined fits to the expected rates are performed with the mass scaling factor \(\epsilon\) and the vacuum expectation value parameter \(M\) as the two parameters of interest. Figure 1 shows the expected two-dimensional likelihood as a function of \(\epsilon\) and \(M\). The predicted values for a SM Higgs boson are \(\epsilon=0\), such that the couplings to fermions and vector bosons would be consistent with a linear and quadratic mass dependence respectively, and \(M=v\approx 246\) GeV.

With 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data and without the inclusion of theoretical uncertainties, the 2-dimensional region of parameter space outside of approximately \(|\epsilon|<0.04\) is expected to be excluded at 95% CL. The corresponding expected compatible region decreases by about a factor of 2 to about \(|\epsilon|<0.02\) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The relative improvement from 300 to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) is similar if theory uncertainties are included.

Meanwhile the 2-dimensional parameter region with values of \(M\) more than 15 GeV different from \(v\approx 246\) GeV are expected to be excluded at 95% CL with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) if no theory uncertainties are included, and with the width of the compatible region expected to shrink by about a factor of 1.5 to about 10 GeV with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\). The relative improvement with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) compared to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) is lower if all systematic uncertainties are included. The correlation between the \(\epsilon\) and \(M\) uncertainties with all systematic uncertainties is different from the case without including the theory uncertainties. This is due to the different relative impact of the theory uncertainties on different channels.

## 4 Minimal Composite Higgs Model

Minimal Composite Higgs Models (MCHM) [29, 30, 31] represent a possible explanation for the scalar naturalness problem, wherein the Higgs boson is a composite, pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson rather than an elementary particle. In such cases, the Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons and fermions are modified with respect to their SM expectations as a function of the Higgs boson compositeness scale,\(f\). Corrections due to new heavy resonances such as vector-like quarks [32] are assumed to be subdominant. Production or decays through loops are resolved in terms of the contributing particles in the loops, assuming only contributions from SM particles. It is assumed that there are no new production and decay modes beyond those in the SM.

In the MCHM4 model [29], the ratio of the predicted couplings to their SM expectations can be written in the particularly simple form:

\[\kappa=\kappa_{V}=\kappa_{F}=\sqrt{1-\xi}, \tag{6}\]

where \(\xi=v^{2}/f^{2}\) is a scaling parameter such that the SM is recovered in the limit \(\xi\to 0\), namely \(f\to\infty\). The combined signal strength, \(\mu_{h}\), and equivalent coupling scale factor, \(\kappa=\sqrt{\mu_{h}}\), expected using the combination of all channels considered are listed in Model 1 of Table 1. The expected measurements are interpreted in the MCHM4 scenario by rescaling the rates in different production and decay modes as functions of the couplings \(\kappa=\kappa_{V}=\kappa_{F}\), assuming the same production and decay modes as in the SM. The couplings are in turn expressed as functions of \(\xi\) using Eq. 6.

The SM Higgs boson corresponds to \(\xi=0\). Assuming the SM Higgs boson, the scaling parameter is expected to be measured as \(\xi=1-\mu_{h}=0.000\pm 0.085\) (0.065) using 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) (3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) of data. With 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data and with (without) including theory uncertainties, the expected 95% CL upper limit is \(\xi<0.16\) (0.092), corresponding to a Higgs boson compositeness scale of \(f>620\) GeV (810 GeV). The limits with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are \(\xi<0.12\) (0.063) and \(f>710\) GeV (980 GeV). The results are limited by the theoretical uncertainties on the Higgs production rates through gluon fusion and vector boson fusion [18].

Similarly, in the MCHM5 model [30, 31] the expected rates are expressed in terms of \(\xi\) by rewriting the couplings as:

\[\kappa_{V}=\sqrt{1-\xi}\] \[\kappa_{F}=\frac{1-2\xi}{\sqrt{1-\xi}}. \tag{7}\]

The expected measurements of \(\kappa_{V}\) and \(\kappa_{F}\) are given in Model 2 of Table 1. As with the MCHM4 model, in the MCHM5 model the SM Higgs boson corresponding to \(\xi=0\). Assuming the SM Higgs boson, the composite Higgs boson scaling parameter is expected to be measured as \(\xi=0.000\pm 0.057\) (0.033) for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) (3000 fb\({}^{-1}\)) of data. With 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data and with (without) including theory uncertainties, the expected 95% CL upper limit is \(\xi<0.10\) (0.067), corresponding to a Higgs boson compositeness scale of \(f>\)780 GeV (950 GeV). The limits with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) are \(\xi<0.060\) (0.039) and \(f>\)1.0 TeV (1.2 TeV). Figure 2 shows the expected two-dimensional likelihood for vector boson (\(\kappa_{V}\)) and fermion (\(\kappa_{F}\)) coupling measurements in the (\(\kappa_{V},\kappa_{F}\)) plane, overlaid with predictions as parametric functions of \(\xi\) for the MCHM4 and MCHM5 models. A secondary minimum in the likelihood at \(\kappa_{F}<0\) is rejected at more than 95% CL.

Table 2 summarizes the expected 95% CL lower limit on the Higgs boson compositeness scale with 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV in the MCHM4 and MCHM5 models.

## 5 Additional Electroweak Singlet

The simplest extension to the SM Higgs sector involves the addition of one scalar EW singlet field [28, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38] to the doublet Higgs field of the SM. This is realized, for example, in the Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) [39, 40, 41, 42]. Both fields acquire non-zero vacuum expectation values. Spontaneous symmetry breaking leads to mixing between the singlet state and the surviving

\end{table}

Figure 2: Expected two-dimensional likelihood contours in the \((\kappa_{V},\kappa_{F})\) coupling plane, where \(-2\ln\Lambda=6.0\) corresponds approximately to 95% CL (\(2\sigma\)). The coupling predictions in the MCHM4 and MCHM5 models are shown as parametric functions of the Higgs boson compositeness parameter \(\xi=v^{2}/f^{2}\). The two-dimensional likelihood contours are shown for reference and should not be used to estimate the exclusion for the single parameter \(\xi\).

state of the doublet field, resulting in two CP-even Higgs bosons, where \(h\) (\(H\)) denotes the lighter (heavier) of the pair. The two Higgs bosons, \(h\) and \(H\), are assumed to be non-degenerate. They couple to fermions and vector bosons in a similar way as the SM Higgs boson, but each with a strength reduced by a common scale factor, denoted as \(\kappa\) for \(h\) and \(\kappa^{\prime}\) for \(H\). The constraint of unitarity implies that:

\[\kappa^{2}+{\kappa^{\prime}}^{2}=1. \tag{8}\]

The lighter Higgs boson \(h\) is assumed to be the Higgs boson with mass \(m_{h}\sim 125\) GeV that has been observed. Its production and decay modes are assumed to be identical to those of the SM Higgs boson, with only SM particles contributing to loop-induced production or decay. In this model, its production and decay rates are modified according to:

\[\begin{array}{lll}\sigma_{h}&=&\kappa^{2}\times\sigma_{h,\text{SM}}\\ \Gamma_{h}&=&\kappa^{2}\times\Gamma_{h,\text{SM}}\\ \text{BR}_{h,i}&=&\text{BR}_{h,\text{SM},i},\end{array} \tag{9}\]

where \(\sigma\) denotes the production cross section, \(\Gamma\) denotes the total decay width, BR denotes the branching ratio, and \(i\) indexes the different decay modes.

For the heavier Higgs boson \(H\), new decay modes such as \(H\to hh\) are possible if they are kinematically accessible. In this case, the production and decay rates of the \(H\) boson are modified with respect to those of a SM Higgs boson with equal mass by the branching ratio of all new decay modes, \(\text{BR}_{H,\text{new}}\), as:

\[\begin{array}{lll}\sigma_{H}&=&{\kappa^{\prime}}^{2}\times\sigma_{H,\text{ SM}}\\ \Gamma_{H}&=&\frac{{\kappa^{\prime}}^{2}}{1-\text{BR}_{H,\text{new}}}\times \Gamma_{H,\text{SM}}\\ \text{BR}_{H,i}&=&(1-\text{BR}_{H,\text{new}})\times\text{BR}_{H,\text{SM},i}. \end{array} \tag{10}\]

Here \(\sigma_{H,\text{SM}}\), \(\Gamma_{H,\text{SM}}\), and \(\text{BR}_{H,\text{SM},i}\) denote the cross section, total width, and branching ratio for a given decay mode (indexed \(i\)) predicted for a SM Higgs boson with mass \(m_{H}\).

Consequently the overall signal strength, namely the ratio of production and decay rates in the measured channels relative to the expectations for a SM Higgs boson with corresponding mass, is given by:

\[\begin{array}{lll}\mu_{h}&=&\frac{\sigma_{h}\times\text{BR}_{h}}{(\sigma_{h} \times\text{BR}_{h})_{\text{SM}}}&=&\kappa^{2}\\ \\ \mu_{H}&=&\frac{\sigma_{H}\times\text{BR}_{H}}{(\sigma_{H}\times\text{BR}_{H}) _{\text{SM}}}&=&\kappa^{\prime 2}\left(1-\text{BR}_{H,\text{new}}\right) \end{array} \tag{11}\]

for \(h\) and \(H\) respectively, assuming the narrow-width approximation.

Combining Eqs. 8 and 11, the squared coupling of the heavy Higgs boson can be expressed in terms of the signal strength of the light Higgs boson as:

\[{\kappa^{\prime}}^{2}=1-\mu_{h}. \tag{12}\]

The expected signal strength precision of the light Higgs boson, measured using the combination of all channels considered, is given in Model 1 of Table 1. The squared coupling of the heavy Higgs boson is expected to be constrained via \({\kappa^{\prime}}^{2}=1-\mu_{h}\), yielding an expected 95% CL upper limit on \({\kappa^{\prime}}^{2}\). From Eqs. 11, this corresponds to the maximum signal strength for contamination of a heavy Higgsboson into the light Higgs boson signal. Figure 3 shows the expected limits in the \((\mu_{H},\text{BR}_{H,\text{new}})\) plane of the heavy Higgs boson. Expected contours of the scale factor for the total width, \(\Gamma_{H}/\Gamma_{H,\text{SM}}\), and \(\kappa^{\prime\,2}\), based on Eqs. 10 and 11, are also illustrated.

As given in Model 1 of Table 1[18], the expected precision on \(\kappa\) improves from about 4.2% (2.4%) with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 3.2% (1.7%) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV with (without) the inclusion of theory uncertainties in the coupling measurements. This improvement is driven by the high-precision measurements in the \(h\to\gamma\gamma\), \(h\to ZZ^{*}\to 4\ell\), and \(h\to WW^{*}\to\ell\nu\,\ell\nu\) channels. As for the MCHM4 model in Sec. 4, the results are limited by the theoretical uncertainties on the gluon fusion and vector boson fusion rates [18]. It corresponds to an improvement on the 95% CL upper limit on the coupling to the heavy Higgs boson, \(\kappa^{\prime\,2}=1-\kappa^{2}\), from 0.17 (0.10) with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) to 0.13 (0.06) with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) as indicated in Table 3. These results are independent of the mass and BR\({}_{H,\text{new}}\) of the heavy Higgs boson.

Figure 3: Expected upper limits at 95% CL on the squared coupling, \(\kappa^{\prime\,2}\), of a heavy Higgs boson arising through an additional EW singlet, shown in the \((\mu_{H},\text{BR}_{H,\text{new}})\) plane. The light shaded and hashed regions indicate the expected exclusions. Contours of the scale factor for the total width, \(\Gamma_{H}/\Gamma_{H,\text{SM}}\), and \(\kappa^{\prime\,2}\), of the heavy Higgs boson are also illustrated based on Eqs. 10 and 11.

Two Higgs Doublet Model

Another simple extension of the SM Higgs sector is a class of models termed "Two-Higgs-Doublet Models" (2HDMs) [28, 43, 44, 45], in which the SM Higgs sector is extended by an additional doublet. A concrete example of this model is realized in the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model since supersymmetry requires a second Higgs doublet, one coupling only to up-type quarks and the other only to down-type quarks and charged leptons.

2HDMs predict the existence of five Higgs bosons: two neutral CP-even bosons \(h\) and \(H\), one neutral CP-odd boson \(A\), and two charged bosons \(H^{\pm}\). The most general 2HDMs predict CP-violating Higgs boson couplings as well as tree-level flavor changing neutral currents. Since the latter are strongly constrained by existing data, the models considered have additional requirements imposed, such as the Glashow-Weinberg condition [46, 47], in order to evade existing experimental bounds.

Both Higgs doublets acquire vacuum expectation values, \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) respectively. Their ratio is denoted by \(\tan\beta\equiv v_{2}/v_{1}\), and they satisfy \(v_{1}^{2}+v_{2}^{2}=v^{2}\approx(246\ \mathrm{GeV})^{2}\). The Higgs sector of the 2HDM model can be described by six parameters: four Higgs boson masses (\(m_{h}\), \(m_{H}\), \(m_{A}\), and \(m_{H^{\pm}}\)), \(\tan\beta\), and the mixing angle \(\alpha\) of the two neutral, CP-even Higgs states. Gauge invariance fixes the couplings of the two neutral, CP-even Higgs bosons to vector bosons relative to their SM values to be:

\[g_{hVV}^{\mathrm{2HDM}}/g_{hVV}^{\mathrm{SM}} = \sin(\beta-\alpha) \tag{13}\] \[g_{HVV}^{\mathrm{2HDM}}/g_{HVV}^{\mathrm{SM}} = \cos(\beta-\alpha)\.\]

Here \(V=W,Z\) and \(g_{hVV,HVV}^{\mathrm{SM}}\) denote the SM Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons.

The Glashow-Weinberg condition is satisfied by four types of 2HDMs [45]:

* Type I: One Higgs doublet couples to vector bosons, while the other couples to fermions. The first doublet is "fermiophobic" in the limit of no mixing.
* Type II: This is an "MSSM-like" model, in which one Higgs doublet couples to up-type quarks and the other to down-type quarks and charged leptons.
* Type III: This is a "lepton-specific" model, where the Higgs bosons have the same couplings to quarks as in the Type I model and to charged leptons as in Type II.
* Type IV: This is a "flipped" model, where the Higgs bosons have the same couplings to quarks as in the Type II model and to charged leptons as in Type I.

The couplings of the light Higgs boson \(h\) to vector bosons and fermions in each of the four types of 2HDMs, expressed as ratios relative to the Higgs boson couplings in the SM, are summarized in Table 4[48]. The coupling scale factors are denoted \(\kappa_{V}\) for the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons, \(\kappa_{u}\) for up-type quarks, \(\kappa_{d}\) for down-type quarks, and \(\kappa_{l}\) for charged leptons.

The Higgs boson rate measurements in different production and decay modes are interpreted in each of these four types of 2HDMs assuming that the observed new particle with mass \(m_{h}\sim 125\ \mathrm{GeV}\) is the light CP-even neutral Higgs boson \(h\). This is done by rescaling the production and decay rates as functions of the couplings \(\kappa_{V}\), \(\kappa_{u}\), \(\kappa_{d}\), and \(\kappa_{l}\). The expected measurements of these couplings, which assume the same production and decay modes as in the SM, are given in Models 2-5 of Table 1. These couplings are in turn expressed as a function of the underlying parameters, the two angles \(\beta\) and \(\alpha\), using the relations shown in Table 4. Here it is also assumed that the decay modes are the same as those for the SM Higgs boson.

The coupling-rescaled predictions agree with those obtained using the SUSHI [49] and 2HDMC [50] programs, which calculate Higgs boson production and decay rates respectively in two-Higgs-doublet models. The rescaled gluon fusion rate agrees with the SUSHI prediction to better than a percent, and the rescaled decay rates show a similar level of agreement. The cross section for \(bbh\) associated production is calculated using SUSHI and included as a correction that scales with the square of the Yukawa coupling to the \(b\)-quark, under the assumption that it produces differential distributions that are the same as those in gluon fusion. The correction is a small fraction of the total production rate for the regions of parameter space where the data would be compatible with the SM at 95% CL.

Figure 4 shows the regions of the \((\cos(\beta-\alpha),\tan\beta)\) plane that are expected to be excluded at 95% CL or greater assuming the SM Higgs sector. The expected exclusions are shown for 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) at \(\sqrt{s}\)=14 TeV, with and without the inclusion of theory uncertainties, and for each of the four types of 2HDMs. The expected exclusion regions in \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\) depend on the particular functional dependence of the couplings on \(\beta\) and \(\alpha\), which are different for each of the four types of 2HDMs as shown in Table 4. The SM-like alignment limit is at \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)=0\). The range 0.1\(\leq\tan\beta\leq\)10 is shown, but the compatible region extends to larger and smaller \(\tan\beta\) values, but with a correspondingly narrower range of \(\cos(\beta-\alpha)\).

## 7 Simplified MSSM

Supersymmetry [51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59] provides a means to solve the hierarchy problem by introducing superpartners of the corresponding SM particles. Many supersymmetric models also provide a candidate for a dark matter particle.

In the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model [60, 61, 62, 63, 64], the mass mixing matrix for the neutral, CP-even Higgs bosons is:

\[\mathcal{M}_{S}^{2}=(m_{Z}^{2}+\delta_{1})\begin{bmatrix}\cos^{2}(\beta)&- \cos(\beta)\sin(\beta)\\ -\cos(\beta)\sin(\beta)&\sin^{2}(\beta)\end{bmatrix}+m_{A}^{2}\begin{bmatrix} \sin^{2}(\beta)&-\cos(\beta)\sin(\beta)\\ -\cos(\beta)\sin(\beta)&\cos^{2}(\beta)\end{bmatrix}+\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\ 0&\frac{\delta}{\sin^{2}(\beta)}\end{bmatrix} \tag{14}\]

where \(\delta_{1}\) and \(\delta\) are radiative corrections involving primarily top quarks and stops. The couplings in a simplified MSSM model can be obtained from this mass mixing matrix as follows [65, 66].

The trace of the mass mixing matrix is taken and evaluated at the light Higgs boson mass of \(m_{h}=125.0\) GeV, allowing the \(\delta_{1}\) and \(\delta\) corrections to be determined as a function of \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\). Neglecting the sub-leading correction \(\delta_{1}\), then by substituting for \(\delta\) the mass mixing matrix is fully determined by \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\). This matrix is diagonalized to find the eigenvectors, and in particular those components of the eigenvector corresponding to the light Higgs boson, \(s_{u}\) and \(s_{d}\). This allows the Higgs boson couplings to vector bosons (\(\kappa_{V}\)), up-type fermions (\(\kappa_{u}\)), and down-type fermions (\(\kappa_{d}\)), as ratios to the

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c} Coupling scale factor & Type I & Type II & Type III & Type IV \\ \hline \(\kappa_{V}\) & \(\sin(\beta-\alpha)\) & \(\sin(\beta-\alpha)\) & \(\sin(\beta-\alpha)\) & \(\sin(\beta-\alpha)\) \\ \(\kappa_{u}\) & \(\cos(\alpha)/\sin(\beta)\) & \(\cos(\alpha)/\sin(\beta)\) & \(\cos(\alpha)/\sin(\beta)\) & \(\cos(\alpha)/\sin(\beta)\) \\ \(\kappa_{d}\) & \(\cos(\alpha)/\sin(\beta)\) & \(-\sin(\alpha)/\cos(\beta)\) & \(\cos(\alpha)/\sin(\beta)\) & \(-\sin(\alpha)/\cos(\beta)\) \\ \(\kappa_{l}\) & \(\cos(\alpha)/\sin(\beta)\) & \(-\sin(\alpha)/\cos(\beta)\) & \(-\sin(\alpha)/\cos(\beta)\) & \(\cos(\alpha)/\sin(\beta)\) \\ \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Couplings of the light Higgs boson \(h\) to weak vector bosons (\(\kappa_{V}\)), up-type quarks (\(\kappa_{u}\)), down-type quarks (\(\kappa_{d}\)), and charged leptons (\(\kappa_{l}\)), expressed as ratios to the corresponding SM predictions in 2HDMs of various types.

Figure 4: Regions of the \((\cos(\beta-\alpha),\ \tan\beta)\) plane of four types of 2HDMs expected to be excluded by fits to the measured rates of Higgs boson production and decays. The confidence intervals account for a possible relative sign between different couplings. The expected likelihood contours where \(-2\ln\Lambda=6.0\), corresponding approximately to 95% CL (\(2\sigma\)), are indicated assuming the SM Higgs sector. The light shaded and hashed regions indicate the expected exclusions.

corresponding SM expectations, to be determined as functions of \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\) only:

\[\begin{split}\kappa_{V}&=\frac{s_{d}(m_{A},\tan\beta)+ \tan\beta\ s_{u}(m_{A},\tan\beta)}{\sqrt{1+\tan^{2}\beta}}\\ \kappa_{u}&=s_{u}(m_{A},\tan\beta)\frac{\sqrt{1+ \tan^{2}\beta}}{\tan\beta}\\ \kappa_{d}&=s_{d}(m_{A},\tan\beta)\sqrt{1+\tan^{2} \beta},\end{split} \tag{15}\]

where the functions \(s_{u}\) and \(s_{d}\) are given by:

\[\begin{split} s_{u}&=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+ \left(\frac{m_{A}^{2}+m_{A}^{2}}{m_{Z}^{2}+m_{A}^{2}}\tan^{2}\beta-m_{h}^{2}(1+ \tan^{2}\beta)\right)^{2}}}\\ s_{d}&=\frac{\left(m_{A}^{2}+m_{Z}^{2}\right)\tan \beta}{m_{Z}^{2}+m_{A}^{2}\tan^{2}\beta-m_{h}^{2}(1+\tan^{2}\beta)}\ s_{u}. \end{split} \tag{16}\]

To test this model, the expected production and decay rates are expressed in terms of the corresponding couplings. The observed new particle with mass \(m_{h}\sim 125\) GeV is assumed to be the light CP-even neutral Higgs boson \(h\). Model 3 of Table 1 lists the expected precision for the \(\kappa_{V}\), \(\kappa_{u}\), and \(\kappa_{d}\) couplings to be measured assuming identical production and decay modes to the SM. The couplings are in turn cast in terms of \(m_{A}\) and \(\tan\beta\) using Eq. 15. A correction is applied for \(bbh\) associated production as a function of the \(b\)-quark Yukawa coupling as described in Sec. 6. Loop corrections from stops in gluon fusion production and diphoton decays are expected to be small - less than about 5% for \(m_{\rm stop}>500\) GeV [65] - and are neglected. Additional corrections in the MSSM that would break the universality of down-type fermion couplings, such that for example \(\kappa_{b}\neq\kappa_{\tau}\), are generally sub-dominant effects [66] and are not included.

The expected two-dimensional likelihood scan in the \((m_{A},\tan\beta)\) plane for this simplified MSSM model is shown in Fig. 5. The expected best-fit value, assuming the SM, is generally consistent with the SM decoupling limit at large \(m_{A}\). With 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, the expected lower limit at 95% CL on the CP-odd Higgs boson mass is \(m_{A}>390\) GeV (490 GeV) for \(2\leq\tan\beta\leq 10\) with (without) the inclusion of theory uncertainties, with the limit increasing to larger masses for \(\tan\beta<2\). With 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data, the expected limit is \(m_{A}>480\) GeV (640 GeV). Only the range 0\(\leq\tan\beta\leq\)10 is shown, but the expected compatibility region extends to larger \(\tan\beta\) values.

The results reported here pertain to the simplified MSSM model studied and are not fully general. This model serves as a useful benchmark, particularly if no direct observation of supersymmetry is made. The MSSM includes other possibilities such as Higgs boson decays to supersymmetric particles, decays of heavy Higgs bosons to lighter ones [67], and effects from light supersymmetric particles [68] which are not investigated here.

## 8 Higgs Portal to Dark Matter

Many "Higgs portal" models [69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74] introduce an additional weakly-interacting massive particle (WIMP) as a dark matter candidate. It is assumed to interact very weakly with the SM particles, except for the Higgs boson. In this study, the coupling of the Higgs boson to the WIMP is taken to be a free parameter.

The expected upper limit on the branching ratio of the Higgs boson to invisible final states, BRi, is derived using the combination of rate measurements. The couplings of the Higgs boson to massive particles other than the WIMP are assumed to be equal to the SM predictions, allowing the corresponding partial decay widths and invisible decay width to be inferred. Effective couplings to gluons, \(\kappa_{g}\), photons, \(\kappa_{\gamma}\), and \(Z\)-photon, \(\kappa_{Z\gamma}\), are introduced to absorb the possible contributions of new particles through loops. The Higgs boson production modes are assumed to be the same as those in the SM.

The ratio of the total width of the Higgs boson to the SM expectation, \(\Gamma_{h}/\Gamma_{h,\rm SM}\), is parametrized by \(\kappa_{h}^{2}\) such that:

\[\begin{array}{c}\kappa_{h}^{2}=\Gamma_{h}/\Gamma_{h,\rm SM}=\sum\limits_{j} \kappa_{j}^{2}\rm BR_{j}/(1-\rm BR_{i})\\ \\ \sum\limits_{j}\kappa_{j}^{2}\rm BR_{j}=0.085\,\kappa_{g}^{2}+0.0023\,\kappa_{ \gamma}^{2}+0.0016\,\kappa_{Z\gamma}^{2}+0.91,\end{array} \tag{17}\]

where the branching ratios of a Higgs boson with \(m_{h}=125\) GeV to gluons, photons, and \(Z\gamma\) are 0.085, 0.0023, and 0.0016 respectively, and 0.91 is the sum of the branching ratios of the Higgs boson to massive SM particles [28]. Thus the production and decay rates of all channels are fit with functions of \(\kappa_{g}\), \(\kappa_{\gamma}\), \(\kappa_{Z\gamma}\), and \(\rm BR_{i}\). The gluon, photon, and \(Z\)-photon couplings are treated as nuisance parameters.

With 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data and with (without) the inclusion of theory uncertainties, the expected 95% CL upper limit on the branching ratio of the Higgs boson to invisible final states is \(\rm BR_{i}<0.22\) (0.19). With 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), the expected limit decreases to \(\rm BR_{i}<0.13\) (0.09). The expected measurements for the [\(\kappa_{g}\), \(\kappa_{\gamma}\), \(\kappa_{Z\gamma}\), \(\rm BR_{i}\)] parametrization used are listed in Model 7 of Table 1.

To compare with direct searches for dark matter, the expected upper limit on \(\rm BR_{i}\) is translated into constraints on the coupling of the WIMP to the Higgs boson as a function of its mass [71]. It is assumed that the WIMP mass is less than half the Higgs boson mass and that the resulting Higgs boson decays to WIMP pairs account entirely for \(\rm BR_{i}\). These assumptions produce conservative limits as any additional contributions to \(\rm BR_{i}\) from other new phenomena would produce more stringent results. The partial

Figure 5: Regions of the (\(m_{A},\ \tan\beta\)) plane expected to be excluded in a simplified MSSM model via fits to the measured rates of Higgs boson production and decays. The likelihood contours where \(-2\ln\Lambda=6.0\), corresponding approximately to 95% CL (2\(\sigma\)), are indicated assuming the SM Higgs sector. The light shaded and hashed regions indicate the expected exclusions, respectively. The SM decoupling limit is \(m_{A}\to\infty\).

width for Higgs boson decays to a pair of dark matter particles depends on the spin of the dark matter particle. It is given for scalar, Majorana fermion, or vector dark matter candidates (where the Majorana fermion is motivated by neutralinos in supersymmetry) as:

\[\begin{array}{lll}\text{scalar}\;S\;:&\Gamma^{\text{inv}}(h\to SS)&=& \lambda_{hSS}^{2}\,\frac{v^{2}\beta_{S}}{128\pi m_{h}}\\ \text{fermion}\;f\;:&\Gamma^{\text{inv}}(h\to ff)&=&\frac{ \lambda_{hff}^{2}\,v^{2}\beta_{J}^{3}m_{h}}{64\pi}\\ \text{vector}\;V\;:&\Gamma^{\text{inv}}(h\to VV)&=& \lambda_{hVV}^{2}\frac{v^{2}\beta_{V}m_{h}^{3}}{512\pi m_{V}^{4}} \left(1-4\frac{m_{V}^{2}}{m_{h}^{2}}+12\frac{m_{V}^{4}}{m_{h}^{4}}\right). \end{array} \tag{18}\]

Here \(\lambda_{hSS}\), \(\lambda_{hff}/\Lambda\), and \(\lambda_{hVV}\) are the couplings of the Higgs boson to dark matter particles of corresponding spin, \(v\approx 246\) GeV denotes the vacuum expectation value of the Higgs boson, and \(\beta_{\chi}=\sqrt{1-4m_{\chi}^{2}/m_{h}^{2}}\) is a kinematic factor associated with the two-body \(h\to\chi\chi\) decay. These equations are used to deduce the coupling of the Higgs boson to the WIMP for each of the three possible WIMP spins.

The coupling is then re-parametrized in terms of the cross section for scattering between the WIMP and nucleons via Higgs boson exchange, \(\sigma_{\chi-N}\)[71]:

\[\begin{array}{lll}\text{scalar}\;S\;:&\sigma_{S-N}=\lambda_{hSS}^{2}\,\frac {m_{N}^{4}f_{N}^{2}}{16\pi m_{h}^{4}(m_{S}+m_{N})^{2}}\\ \text{fermion}\;f\;:&\sigma_{f-N}=\frac{\lambda_{hff}^{2}}{\Lambda^{2}}\frac {m_{N}^{4}f_{N}^{2}m_{f}^{2}}{4\pi m_{h}^{4}(m_{f}+m_{N})^{2}}\\ \text{vector}\;V\;:&\sigma_{V-N}=\lambda_{hVV}^{2}\frac{m_{N}^{4}f_{N}^{2}}{16 \pi m_{h}^{4}(m_{V}+m_{N})^{2}},\end{array} \tag{19}\]

where \(m_{N}\sim 0.94\) GeV is the nucleon mass, and \(f_{N}=0.33^{+0.30}_{-0.07}\) is the form factor associated with the Higgs-nucleon coupling, computed using lattice QCD [71].

Expected upper limits at 95% CL on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section \(\sigma_{\chi-N}\) are derived as a function of the WIMP mass \(m_{\chi}\) (\(\chi=S,\;V\), or \(f\)). The results expected with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV including all systematic uncertainties are shown in Fig. 6. The hashed bands indicate the uncertainty resulting from the systematic variation of the form factor \(f_{N}\). They are compared with limits from direct searches for dark matter [75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82] at the confidence levels indicated. The ATLAS expected limits are considerably more stringent at low mass and degrade as \(m_{\chi}\) approaches \(m_{h}/2\) as expected from kinematics. They are shown for \(m_{\chi}\geq 1\) GeV, but extend to smaller WIMP masses than this value. The exclusions are proportional to the expected limits on BR\({}_{i}\) (see Eqns. 18-19), so they improve by approximately a factor of 2 with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) compared to 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) if the theory uncertainties are unchanged. The inclusion of theory uncertainties in the coupling measurements do not have a large impact on the relative improvement.

## 9 Conclusions

The sensitivity has been estimated for an indirect search for new physics using Higgs boson coupling measurements from the combination of multiple production and decay channels (\(h\to\gamma\gamma\),Figure 6: ATLAS expected upper limit at 95% CL on the WIMP-nucleon scattering cross section in a Higgs portal model as a function of the mass of the dark matter particle, shown separately for a scalar, Majorana fermion, or vector boson WIMP, with 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and including all systematic uncertainties. The hashed bands indicate the uncertainty resulting from the form factor \(f_{N}\). Excluded and allowed regions from direct detection experiments at the confidence levels indicated are also shown [75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82]. These are spin-independent results obtained directly from searches for nuclei recoils from elastic scattering of WIMPs, rather than being inferred indirectly through Higgs boson exchange in the Higgs portal model.

\(4\ell\), \(h\to WW^{*}\to\ell\nu\ell\nu\), \(h\to\tau\tau\), \(h\to b\bar{b}\), \(h\to\mu\mu\), and \(h\to Z\gamma\)). Projections are derived for 300 and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of \(pp\) collision data at \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV expected to be collected by the ATLAS experiment, assuming the data follows the SM expectation. The expected precision on the mass scaling of the couplings is estimated. Expected constraints on various models of physics beyond the Standard Model are determined. Expected limits are derived for minimal Higgs compositeness models, an additional electroweak singlet, two-Higgs-doublet models, a simplified MSSM, and a Higgs portal to dark matter. In every case, substantial improvements in sensitivity would be gained with a high-luminosity upgrade to the LHC to collect up to 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The inclusion of additional channels, as well as future improvements in the understanding of experimental and theoretical systematic uncertainties on the coupling measurements, would provide additional potential for sensitivity gains at the High-Luminosity LHC.
