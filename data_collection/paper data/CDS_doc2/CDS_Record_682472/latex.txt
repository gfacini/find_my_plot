ABSTRACT

The two photon decay channel is the most clear and promising way to detect a Higgs at LHC in the mass window \(90<\mbox{m}_{\mbox{H}}{}^{\circ}<140\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\). As the Higgs mass is narrow in this range, the observation of this channel relies heavily on the performance of the electromagnetic calorimeter. A full simulation study has been performed with the liquid Argon ATLAS calorimeter. The simulation includes different contributions such as: sampling term, electronic and pile-up noise, constant term and angular measurement of the two photon opening angle. The level of the irreducible background such as prompt diphoton production and reducible backgrounds such as photon-jet and jet-jet with leading \(\pi^{\circ}\) have been estimated, taking into account the rejection capability of the calorimeter. Finally the discovery potential of \(\mbox{H}^{\circ}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) in ATLAS has been computed.

Interest of the Higgs to two photon decay channel and production rate

### Interest of the \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\)

The study of the nature of the Electroweak (EW) symmetry breaking mechanism is the primary goal of the future LHC proton-proton collider. The discovery of the Higgs boson would be the last major test of the standard model (SM).

The limit on the Higgs mass, from the four experiments at LEP I, is 65.2 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)[3]. A direct search at LEP II will be possible up to 95 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) and slightly lower, \(\sim 90\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\), in the case of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson \(\PH\) of the minimal supersymetric model (MSSM) [4]. A search at TeVatron is limited due to the lack of luminosity. Recent fits of EW theory to the most recent data collected in running experiments are consistent with a Higgs mass of \(70^{+111}_{-45}\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\), and \(103^{+161}_{-68}\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) if one excludes measurements of \(\PH\) and \(\PH\), that deviate from SM predictions [5]. These values support an intermediate Higgs mass hypothesis. The precision on these fits will improve by the LHC running time : \(\Delta\PH\sim 40\) MeV/c\({}^{2}\) (LEP II and TeVatron), \(\Delta\PH\sim 5\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) (TeVatron).

The LHC will operate at a maximum energy of 14 TeV in the mass of center with a luminosity of \(10^{34}\,\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s}^{-1}\), leading to an integrated luminosity per year of \(10^{5}\,\mathrm{pb}^{-1}\). This will offer the opportunity to explore the complete allowed spectrum for the Higgs mass up to \(\sim 1\) TeV/c\({}^{2}\).

In the mass window \(80<\PH<150\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\), the channel \(\PH\to\bbbar\) is favoured by its branching ratio, but due to the large jet background at LHC, the search for the Higgs in this mode is extremely difficult. In this context the search for the Higgs decaying in two photons is the most clear and promising way to detect the Higgs in this mass range. Moreover, this overlaps quite well LEP II domain. Above 130 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), the four leptons final decay mode at LHC will be competitive.

### Production rate

The cross-sections (\(\sigma\)) and the kinematics of signal and backgrounds are generated with PYTHIA 5.7 and JETSET 7.4. The branching ratio (Br) of \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) is of the order of \(10^{-3}\). The \(\sigma\times\mathrm{Br}\) is plotted in Fig. 1 as a function of the Higgs mass. In one year at high luminosity (100 fb\({}^{-1}\)) around 4000 events are expected [6].

The following study has been performed with and without including higher order QCD corrections (K-factors). These corrections increase the signal cross-section by a factor of 1.5 to 1.7 [7], but are not yet fully available for all backgrounds contributions.

For the Higgs sector of MSSM, the search for the lightest Higgs boson \(\PH\), in the decay mode \(\PH\to\gamma\gamma\) at LHC and above 90 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), appears as the natural complement of a search at LEP II. The MSSM predicts a maximum value for \(\PH\) mass of 150 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), including radiative corrections. The analysis remains the same as in the case of the SM, but the rate for the signal is significantly reduced by up to a factor of 10. In Fig. 1 mass isolines for \(\PH\) and corresponding \(\sigma\times\mathrm{Br}\) isolines for \(\rm h^{\circ}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\), are given in the usual plane (\(\rm m_{A^{\circ}}\),\(\rm tan(\beta)\)), with same conditions as quoted in reference [4]. The equivalent SM rate for \(\rm h^{\circ}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) is only attained at high \(\rm A^{\circ}\) masses. As a consequence, this channel requires a large LHC integrated luminosity in order to explore the region \(\rm m_{A^{\circ}}<200-300~{}GeV/c^{2}~{}and~{}tan(\beta)>4\).

In both cases, SM or MSSM, the natural Higgs width is very narrow : \(\sim 10-20~{}MeV/c^{2}\), well below the detector resolution. In order to separate a signal from the background, an excellent mass resolution (\(\Delta\rm m_{\gamma\gamma}\)) for photon pairs is mandatory. This decay mode is taken as a benchmark signal for LHC calorimetry.

## 2 Backgrounds rejection

The search for a \(\rm H^{\circ}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) signal at LHC has to treat two types of backgrounds : a reducible one, mainly due to jets that fake \(\gamma\)'s in calorimeters and an irreducible one, due to direct photon pair production. These backgrounds are predicted to be well above the signal before selection by around 8 orders of magnitude. The high efficiency required to reject the backgrounds puts strong constraints on ATLAS subdetectors. The main part of background reduction is based on the identification of isolated \(\gamma\)'s of high transverse energy.

It is of prime importance to keep in mind that LHC will give access to energies 10 times higher than the ones we explore today. As a consequence the background levels have to be evaluated with safety factors incorporated.

### Reducible backgrounds

The reducible background comes from jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet events which simulate a photon pair. The amount of this background is \(2\times 10^{6}\) and \(8\times 10^{2}\) times the \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum (cuts for \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum are included at this level and the pseudo photon pair is required to be in range \(70<\mbox{m}_{\gamma\gamma}<170\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\)). The rejection of this background is based on the use of calorimeters in a stand-alone mode. A full simulation, with GEANT 3.21, of 10\({}^{6}\) jets and of dedicated samples of \(\pi^{\circ}\) and \(\gamma\)'s, in the ATLAS detector, has been performed. The rejection of these backgrounds relies heavily on the longitudinal segmentation of the ATLAS EM CALO and on its lateral granularity [8]. The different behaviour of jets and \(\gamma\)'s in the electromagnetic calorimeter (EM CALO) is used. A cut on the activity in the hadronic calorimeter behind the EM CALO selected cluster is also applied. An integrated preshower in EM CALO with a fine granularity (strips of \(\sim 4\) mm at a radius of 1.5 m) is used to identify the \(\pi^{\circ}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) whose clusters are unresolved. More details can be found in these proceedings[9].

In Fig. 2 the relative amount of this background compared to the \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum is given after the shower shape analysis with the calorimeters (dashed lines). The major part of the background is already removed at this stage. The prompt isolated \(\pi^{\circ}\)'s dominate the remaining reducible background sample. The effect of the \(\pi^{\circ}/\gamma\) identification (ID) can be seen in Fig. 2 (solid lines). The integrated preshower gives a rejection factor of more than 3 for \(\pi^{\circ}\)'s of \(\mbox{E}_{\mbox{T}}=50\) GeV (\(>4\) at 25 GeV). The resulting value for the rejection of jets is : \(\mbox{R}_{\mbox{jet}}\sim 3600\) for \(\mbox{P}_{\mbox{T}}=20\) GeV and \(\mbox{R}_{\mbox{jet}}\sim 7500\) for \(\mbox{P}_{\mbox{T}}=40\) GeV. The efficiency for the \(\gamma\)'s of the \(\mbox{H}^{\circ}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) signal due to this ID is fixed at 80 %. The \(\gamma\)-jet background dominates the sample of the reducible background at the end. Finally, the reducible background is reduced so that : \((jet-jet+\gamma-jet)<20\%\times\gamma\gamma_{continuum}\). This safety factor of 5 is necessary due to limited knowledge of jet production and the limited power of prediction of the

simulation at this level of accuracy (final detector design, unknown material effects, physics of the generator simulating interactions of particles through the detector, etc).

At the \(\mathrm{Z^{\circ}}\) mass, the \(\mathrm{Z^{\circ}}\rightarrow\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\) rate is \(2.5\times 10^{4}\) more abundant than the \(\mathrm{H^{\circ}}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\). To remove this background, a high efficiency for the ATLAS tracker to associate a charged track with a cluster in the EM CALO is mandatory, especially at high luminosity. It has been demonstrated that a rejection factor for electrons of 450 is achievable [10]. This means that the visible rate for \(\mathrm{Z^{\circ}}\rightarrow\mathrm{e^{+}e^{-}}\) can be reduced to a level of 20 % compared to the \(\mathrm{H^{\circ}}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) rate at the \(\mathrm{Z^{\circ}}\) mass, at a price of a lower relative reconstruction efficiency (\(\varepsilon_{\mathrm{H^{\circ}}}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\sim 75\%\)).

### Irreducible backgrounds

After rejection of the reducible background, the irreducible background dominates. The \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum has a cross section \(\frac{\mathrm{d}_{\sigma_{\gamma\gamma}}}{\mathrm{dm}_{\gamma\gamma}}\sim 5 \to 0.5\) (\(\mathrm{pb/GeV/c^{2}}\)) in the range \(70<\mathrm{m}_{\gamma\gamma}<150\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\), equivalent to \(10\to 100\) times the rate of the signal. Three main processes contribute to the \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum (Fig. 3). By requiring \(\mathrm{P_{T}^{1}}>40\)GeV/c, \(\mathrm{P_{T}^{2}}>25\)GeV/c and by only selecting central \(\gamma\)'s, \(|\eta_{1,2}|<2.5\), the continuum can be reduced by a factor of 10. Above \(|\eta_{1,2}|=2.5\), the \(\gamma\gamma\) background strongly dominates. So that it is not necessary to equip the ATLAS EM CALO with a fine granularity integrated preshower beyond this limit. This limit also corresponds to the end of the tracking system. The relative efficiency of this selection to the signal is around 50%. After these cuts, the contribution from the box is equivalent to the one from the Born.

The full NLO QCD calculation to the \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum must be done at order \(\mathrm{o(\alpha_{s}^{3}\alpha_{QED}^{2})}\) due to the box diagram, but for the moment this is not available and this seems to be very difficult.

The third process contributing to \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum is the quark bremsstrahlung. This is not fully irreducible as the softer \(\gamma\) is produced in the close vicinity of the jet coming from the fragmentation of the radiating parton. By requiring that there

is no jet with \(\mathrm{P_{T}}>15\) GeV in a cone \(\Delta R=0.7\) around the direction of the \(\gamma\)'s1, an additional factor 3 is obtained. After this isolation cut the quark bremsstrahlung contribution is around 50 % of the Born+ box contribution.

Footnote 1: \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\)

## 3 Signal reconstruction : mass resolution

The \(\Delta\mathrm{m_{\gamma\gamma}}\) resolution is given by the following formula :

\[\frac{\Delta\mathrm{m_{\gamma\gamma}}}{\mathrm{m_{\gamma\gamma}}}=\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{\Delta\mathrm{E_{1}}}{\mathrm{E_{1}}}\oplus\frac{\Delta\mathrm{E_{ 2}}}{\mathrm{E_{2}}}\oplus\frac{\Delta\theta_{\gamma\gamma}}{\mathtt{tan}\left( \theta_{\gamma\gamma}/2\right)}\right) \tag{1}\]

The required precision in measuring the photon energies and the two photon opening angle puts strong constraints on the ATLAS EM calorimetry. The EM CALO has been optimized with a full simulation of the ATLAS detector[8], including in particular a precise description of the LArg EM CALO with the accordion geometry of the absorbers. This simulation is in good agreement with the data obtained in test beam, with the RD3 2 meter prototype[11].

### Energy resolution

The energy resolution, for single \(\gamma\)'s of \(\mathrm{E_{T}}=50\) GeV, is displayed in Fig. 4, as a function of the calorimeter pseudo-rapidity. It is parametrized as : \(\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus\frac{b}{E}\oplus c\), where a is the stochastic term, b the contribution of electronic and pile-up noise and c is the constant term.

#### 3.1.1 Stochastic term

This contribution varies from 8.5 %\(\mathrm{GeV^{1/2}}\) at \(\eta=0\) (90\({}^{\circ}\) from the beam axis) to 11 %\(\mathrm{GeV^{1/2}}\) at the transition between the barrel and the endcaps, and is typically 10 %\(\mathrm{GeV^{1/2}}\) in the endcaps. The energy of unconverted \(\gamma\)'s is reconstructed in an equivalent cluster size \(\eta\times\phi=3\times 5\) cells of the second sampling (granularity : \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=.025\times.0245\)). This cluster size was found to be an optimal compromise between intrinsic resolution and sensitivity to pile-up and electronic noises, which increases with larger clusters areas.

The converted \(\gamma\)'s are tagged in the tracker. As the e+e- pair opens in \(\phi\), due to the 2 Tesla solenoidal magnetic field, a \(3\times 7\) cluster size is used to reconstruct the energy. The presampler is used to correct for the energy lost in the superconducting coil and in the cryostat walls located in front of the EM CALO. The fraction of \(\mathrm{H^{\circ}}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events with at least one converted \(\gamma\) is 18%.

#### 3.1.2 Constant term

Due to the high energy of the \(\gamma\)'s from Higgs decay, this contribution must be kept below 1 %, with the goal of 0.7 % over a very large number of channels (190, 000). A constant term of 0.7 % has been achieved over 150 towers of the 2 meters prototype in the RD3 test beam [11]. This is equivalent to 20 % of one ATLAS EM supermodule (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=1.4\times.4\)). In ATLAS, a value of 0.4 % is expected in areas of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=2\times.4\) (mechanics + electronic). It has been estimated that five days at \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) should be enough to intercalibrate these areas with Z\({}^{\circ}\rightarrow\) e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) events to an accuracy level of 0.4 %, leading to a total constant term of 0.6 %. To be conservative in the simulation 0.7 % is taken.

#### 3.1.3 Electronic and pileup noise

The pileup contribution is due to 23 events of minimum biased which are produced on average at each bunch crossing, every 25 ns, at high luminosity. This includes the LHC bunch structure (20 % of bunches are empty). A proton inelastic cross section of 70 mb is assumed. A full simulation of the response of the ATLAS EM CALO to pileup events has been performed [12]. The \(CR-RC^{2}\) bipolar shaping response to the triangular signal in LArg has been taken into account. The electronic noise is extracted from recent experimental measurements [13].

It has been demonstrated that, after shaping, the pileup noise sensitivity is equivalent to 1.5 times the pileup noise from one bunch crossing. Fig. 4 shows that at the optimum shaping time response to signal the electronic and pileup noise is around 500 MeV in transverse energy at high luminosity. This is the worst case as a \(3\times 7\) cluster is used (adapted to converted \(\gamma\)'s).

Figure 4: contributions to energy resolution (left). Pileup and electronic noise as a function of peaking time response to signal (right).

### Direction measurement and \(\gamma\gamma\) angle reconstruction.

At high luminosity, due to the superimposed minimum biased events, the longitudinal vertex position is ambiguous. The vertex diamond size around the geometrical center of the detector is : \(\Delta z\times\Delta x\times\Delta y=5.3~{}cm~{}\times(15~{}\mu m)^{2}\).

Techniques to determine the vertex position based on the recognition of \(\mbox{H}^{\circ}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events exist [14]. The \(\mbox{H}^{\circ}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) events have typically a multiplicity of charged tracks 30% higher than the minimum biased events, moreover these tracks have higher \(\mbox{P}_{\mbox{T}}\). Nevertheless the knowledge of pileup events is restricted, and a method, using the EM CALO in stand-alone, has been developped to measure the longitudinal vertex position. This method relies on the lateral and longitudinal segmentation of the calorimeter.

By calculating the lateral and longitudinal centroids of the shower in sampling 1 and samplings 2 and 3, the slope of the shower can be computed and its intersection with the beam axis is determined. In Fig. 5 the resolution on the z vertex reconstruction is displayed in the case of single \(\gamma\)'s. This corresponds to a resolution on the photon azimutal angle \(\theta\) of \(\Delta\theta\simeq 50~{}\mbox{mrad}/\sqrt{E}\) (geometric effects dominate in the endcap).

By combining the two photon measurements, the longitudinal vertex is found with a precision better than 2 cm. At low luminosity, this accuracy is estimated to be sufficient to identify the tracks coming from the \(\mbox{H}^{\circ}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) vertex. When a \(\gamma\) converts in the tracker, the position of conversion is used to increase the lever arm for pointing, leading to a better vertex reconstruction.

Figure 5: resolution of the z vertex reconstruction versus rapidity for single \(\gamma\)’s (left). Mass resolution for the signal (right).

### Mass peak resolution

In Fig. 5, the mass spectrum of the signal is displayed after a full simulation of the detector response for a generated mass of 100 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) at high luminosity. The resolution is 1.24 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) and a fit over the whole mass window gives 1.26 GeV/c\({}^{2}\). The distribution is nicely Gaussian : 82 % of the distribution is contained in \(\pm 1.4\sigma\) around 100 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), when the expectation is 83.8%.

Table 1 give the details of the contributions to the mass resolution. As expected the sampling term dominates the resolution. At low luminosity both the better knowledge of the vertex position and the smaller contribution of pileup allow to improve the resolution by 20%. For events with at least one converted \(\gamma\), at high luminosity, a fit at \(\pm 2\sigma\) gives a mass resolution equal to the resolution of the inclusive sample of events. A fit over the whole window gives 1.4 GeV/c\({}^{2}\). The tails are due to early conversions in the tracker. Finally if the 0.7% constant term is modified to 0.5% (1.%), the resolution becomes 1.19 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) (1.35 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)).

## 4 Discovery potential

Let us assume that an excess of events in the mass distribution m\({}_{\gamma\gamma}\), will be considered as a discovery, if it is larger than a fluctuation of the background by more than 5 standard deviations (\(S/\sqrt{B}>5\)).

For a mass of 100 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), the total efficiency of the signal is 24% : 53% from kinematics and acceptance cuts, 81% per \(\gamma\) for the \(\gamma\)/jet ID, 87% for fiducial cuts (mainly the transition between barrel and endcap), and 80.7% for an optimized mass bin (high lumi. : 3.44 GeV/c\({}^{2}\), low lumi. : 2.74 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)). The details of the numbers of signal and background events in the mass bin are given in table 2. The statistical significance is displayed as a function of the Higgs mass in Fig. 6. It turns out that the Higgs boson can be discovered already at 100 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) in the 2 photondecay channel, for one year of ATLAS running at the LHC high luminosity. An overlap with LEP II at 80 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\) requires an integrated luminosity of \(3.10^{5}\mathrm{pb^{-1}}\).

In Fig. 6, the statistical significance is also presented taking into account the K-factor. An arbitrary factor of 1.5 is applied to the box contribution. At 100 \(\mathrm{GeV/c^{2}}\), the \(\sigma\).Br increases to 68 fb (instead of 47.4 fb). The significance is now 6.5 in one year at high luminosity and 4.2 in 3 years at low luminosity. As previously mentioned, the \(\mathrm{K_{bgd}}\) is not fully calculated, but, as long as its value remains lower

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{||c||c||} \hline \hline signal events in mass bin & 1100 \\ \hline \(\gamma\gamma\) background & 45980 \\ jet-jet background & 1800 \\ jet-\(\gamma\) background & 5400 \\ \(\mathrm{Z\to e^{+}e^{-}}\) background & - \\ \hline \hline \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{B}}\) for \(10^{5}\mathrm{pb^{-1}}\) & **4.8** \\ LHC years for \(5\sigma\) & **1.09** \\ \hline \hline \(\mathrm{S/\sqrt{B}}\) for \(3.10^{4}\mathrm{pb^{-1}}\) & **3.1** \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

than \(K^{2}_{\rm sig}\). (\(2.3\to 2.9\)), its effect can be kept under control.

In the case of the \(h^{\circ}\to\gamma\gamma\) search in MSSM, Fig. 6 shows that the full luminosity is required to cover the SUSY Higgs sector plane with a reasonable complementarity to LEP II [15]. The remaining hole at \(m_{\rm A}^{\circ}\sim 100-175\)\({\rm GeV}/{\rm c}^{2}\) and \(tan(\beta)>4\) will be filled using others channels such as \(A^{\circ}\to\tau\tau\).

## 5 Conclusions and perspectives

It has been demonstrated that the ATLAS detector has a good discovery potential for the \(H^{\circ}\to\gamma\gamma\). The full simulation of the ATLAS detector response to the Higgs decaying in two photons has been performed in the most difficult conditions expected at LHC. The complete background rejection capability has been studied.

Some work is still under way to a better estimation and optimisation of the \(H^{\circ}\to\gamma\gamma\) discovery potential. A full simulation of \(10^{7}\) jets with the latest design of all subdetectors is planned. The electronic front-end has been choosen to be warm preamplifier outside of the cryostat, and the electronic noise value is more precisely known. For this reason, the cluster sizes will be reoptimized : \(3\times 3\) for unconverted \(\gamma\)'s, and \(3\times 5\) for converted \(\gamma\)'s (better total energy resolution, easier \(\gamma\)-JET 1D). The study of the conversion identification with the tracker at high luminosity is in progress. For the \(\gamma\gamma\) continuum, a complete NLO calculation for Born and bremsstrahlung background will be soon available [16]. Bremsstrahlung events have been fully simulated in order to tune the isolation criteria. An up to date study of backgrounds and signal in the associated production looking for a photon pair with a lepton of high transverse energy, or with jets of high energy, is also in progress.
