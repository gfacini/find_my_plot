**Abstract**

Recently, the Physics Simulation group of ATLAS reviewed scenarios for supersymmetric (SUSY) particle searches at the LHC [1]. SUSY was studied in the framework of the minimal supergravity (SUGRA) model through a study of inclusive and exclusive signatures which would lead to:

\(\bullet\) the discovery of SUSY,

\(\bullet\) measurements of SUSY particle masses, and

\(\bullet\) the determination of the parameters of the theoretical model.

This paper presents a study of the inclusive and exclusive signatures for SUSY events produced at the so-called SUGRA _point 1_ and _point 2_, characterised by the same values of the fundamental parameters: m\({}_{0}\) = 400 GeV, m\({}_{1/2}\) = 400 GeV, A = 0, sign\((\mu)~{}=~{}+1\) and two different values of \(\tan\beta\): \(\tan\beta\) = 2 and \(\tan\beta\) = 10 respectively. In particular, a large signal from decays of the lightest Higgs boson, h, can be extracted cleanly above the background from Standard Model and other SUSY processes. Several methods for extracting measurements of the squark and gluino masses are also described, as well as the precision which can be achieved with these measurements as a function of the integrated luminosity.

Introduction

Since many years, the search for supersymmetric (SUSY) particles has been at the forefront of theoretical studies [2]. Despite the lack of any evidence for SUSY to-date, detailed scenarios for SUSY searches have been developed for future pp and e\({}^{+}\)e\({}^{-}\) machines [3].

In high energy hadron colliders, the general impression from these scenarios was until recently that:

1) discovery of the most abundantly produced SUSY particles (\(\tilde{\rm q}\) and \(\tilde{\rm g}\)) above the Standard Model (SM) background would be straightforward in semi-inclusive channels;

2) complete reconstruction of exclusive final states would be extremely difficult (in the case most often studied of R-parity conservation), due to the complicated cascade decays of the parent \(\tilde{\rm q}\) or \(\tilde{\rm g}\), to the large combinatorial backgrounds from other SUSY decays, and to the escaping pair of lightest supersymmetric particles (LSP), assumed in the vast majority of cases to be the lightest neutralino \(\chi^{0}_{1}\);

3) discovery of many of the weakly interacting SUSY particles would be very difficult because of the lower production rates and of the large combinatorial backgrounds from other SUSY decays.

The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM), which was the basis of most of the studies, is very poorly constrained and, within this model, only very limited studies of SUSY at the LHC can be performed. Examples of such studies can be found in the ATLAS Technical Proposal [4], e.g. in the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}+\) multi-jet and same-sign dilepton semi-inclusive channels. None of these studies, however, gave any insight into the potential of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC in terms of measuring SUSY particle masses and determining the model parameters.

These severe limitations of the MSSM are largely overcome [1] in super-gravity (SUGRA) models [5]. In the minimal SUGRA model, five parameters defined at the grand unification scale determine the complete mass spectrum at the electroweak scale, once the renormalisation group equations have been solved. The use of such a model has allowed for the first time a study of the precision measurement capabilities of ATLAS in the SUSY domain. Other reports describing the studies done in this context can be found in [6] and [7].

This note presents a first study using the SUGRA model for the so-called points 1 and 2, which correspond to the same values of the parameters:

\[\mbox{\bf(}\ {\rm m}_{0}\,\ {\rm m}_{1/2}\,\ {\rm A}\,\ {\rm sign}\,(\mu)\ { \rm)}\ =\ (400,400,\ \ 0,+1),\]

but to two different values of \(\tan\beta\), respectively \(\tan\beta=2\) and \(\tan\beta=10\). Most of the results reported here will be specific to point 1, but point 2 corresponds to a very similar spectrum of SUSY particles and decays, and only its most significant differences with respect to point 1 will be presented here.

Point 1 corresponds to a relatively heavy spectrum of SUSY particles with, in particular, squark and gluino masses close to 1000 GeV. The production cross sections are therefore rather small, typically a few pb. This point in parameter space is outside the reach of Tevatron and LEP2. The Higgs boson masses are \(\mathrm{m_{h}}\sim 95\GeV\) and \(\mathrm{m_{H,A,H^{\pm}}}\sim 1050\GeV\). One of the most characteristic features of SUSY particle production for this choice of parameters is the large production of h-bosons through cascade decays of \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}}\) and \(\mathrm{\tilde{g}}\) involving \(\mathrm{\chi^{0}_{2}\to\mathrm{\chi^{0}_{1}h}}\) decays. The resulting \(\mathrm{h\to b\overline{b}}\) decays and the enhanced decay branching ratios of gluinos to heavy-flavour quarks and squarks lead to a large multiplicity of b-jets in the final state.

This last feature, coupled to the more standard features of large \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{\mathrm{miss}}}\) from escaping \(\mathrm{\chi^{0}_{1}}\) and of very hard central jets, are sufficient, despite the rather small production cross-sections, to reduce the SM background well below the semi-inclusive SUSY signal. SUSY decay modes involving leptons are rather rare and were not studied in the context of this report.

This note is organised as follows: Section 2 describes the methods and assumptions used for event generation and for the simulation of the detector performance. Section 3 describes the main features of the SUSY sample which can be extracted using simple kinematic cuts and Section 4 discusses the main features of the relevant SM backgrounds. Section 5 presents some of the possible inclusive selections for SUSY events at point 1. Section 6 describes many of the exclusive experimental observables, which were used to extract measurements of the masses of the light squarks, of the gluino, of the h-boson and of the lightest stop and sbottom quarks. Section 7 summarises the results, but the implications of the experimental measurements on constraining the parameters of the SUGRA model are discussed in a separate note [1, 8].

Event simulation

### Event generation

For the purpose of recent SUSY studies, recent versions of two existing Monte Carlo generators, ISAJET 7.22 [5] and SPYTHIA 2.08 [9] were combined and compared [10]. This event generation package calculates the SUSY particle masses at the electroweak scale using the ISAJET SUGRA renormalisation group equation (RGE) evolution and the Higgs boson masses including 2-loop radiative corrections (code from [11]). The branching ratio calculations and the event generation itself are performed by either of the original Monte Carlo programs.

These modified versions of ISAJET 7.22 and SPYTHIA 2.08 yield good agreement in general for the branching ratios, as shown in Table 3 of Section 3, except the stop-sbottom sector, where the different theoretical assumptions used by both programs result in substantial differences in some cases. For the studies reported in this note, the decay branching ratios from SPYTHIA were used.

A weak point of both event generators, which should not be forgotten, arises from the pure phase-space treatment of SUSY particle decays and from not accounting for spin correlations, neither at production nor for decays. These approximations might turn out to be insufficiently accurate for some of the detailed exclusive analyses presented here.

### Simulation of detector performance

The generated events (SUSY signal and SM background) were run through a fast simulation of the ATLAS detector in the following way:

\(\bullet\) the events were first processed through the fast simulation package ATLFAST [12], which reconstructs jets and isolated leptons and photons with the energy resolution expected in ATLAS. Jets are reconstructed by default for \(\rm p_{T}>15\) GeV (before rescaling to the original parton energy) and \(|\eta|<5.0\), and isolated leptons are reconstructed for \(\rm p_{T}>6\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Hadronic jets are labelled as true c-jets or b-jets if they are within the b-tagging acceptance of the Inner Detector, \(|\eta|<2.5\), and if they are associated to a parent c-quark or b-quark;

\(\bullet\) the overall ATLAS b-tagging performance is emulated in a crude manner by randomly tagging true b-jets as such with a probability of 60 % (resp. 50%) at low (resp. high) luminosity, by randomly mis-tagging true c-jets as b-jets with a probability of 10 %, and by randomly mis-tagging all other jets as b-jets with a probability of 1%;

\(\bullet\) jet energies are re-scaled on average to the original parton energies using the \(\rm p_{T}\)-dependent scaling factors described in [12], as determined separately for b-jets and non-b-jets. After this procedure has been applied, the peak positions for the invariant mass distributions for \(\rm b\overline{b}\) pairs from \(\rm h\to b\overline{b}\) decays and jj pairs from \(\rm W\to jj\) decays are at the correct values within \(\pm\) 1%;\(\bullet\) if necessary, a lepton veto is applied, requiring that no isolated lepton (electron or muon) with \(\rm p_{T}>10\) GeV and \(\rm|\eta|\,<\,2.5\) is reconstructed in the event;

\(\bullet\) if necessary, a jet veto is applied, requiring no additional jet with \(\rm p_{T}\,>\,\,15\) GeV (resp. 40 GeV) within \(\rm|\eta|\,<\,5.0\) at low (resp. high) luminosity. Pile-up effects at high luminosity are included as an additional efficiency factor, \(\rm e^{\rm pile-up}\,=80\) %, applied to signal events for which the jet veto was requested. Although this value is in rough agreement with detailed studies of the calorimeter performance [13], the efficiency of these rather tight jet-veto cuts needs more study to understand possible systematic effects due to imprecise knowledge of initial and final state radiation and, more generally, of higher order QCD corrections;

\(\bullet\) finally, in some rare cases, a \(\tau\)-lepton veto is applied to events for which a hadronic jet from \(\tau\)-decay was reconstructed with \(\rm p_{T}^{\tau}\,>\,15\) GeV and \(\rm|\eta^{\tau}|\,<2.5\).

The version of ATLFAST used for the work reported here did not yet allow to account for the degradation of the jet energy resolution at high luminosity due to pile-up effects. After rescaling of the jet energies, \(\rm W\rightarrow\,jj\) and \(\rm t\rightarrow\,jjb\) decays are reconstructed as peaks centred around \(\rm m_{W}\) and \(\rm m_{t}\) and the mass windows used were \(\pm\,15\) GeV and \(\pm\,30\) GeV respectively. These mass windows are consistent with the expected mass resolutions at low luminosity, e. g. \(\rm\sigma_{m_{jj}}\,=\,(8.9\pm 0.6)\) GeV for \(\rm W\rightarrow\,jj\) decays with \(\rm<p_{T}^{W}>\,\,\,\sim\,\,120\) GeV at low luminosity, but not with those expected at high luminosity (\(\rm\sigma_{m_{jj}}\,=\,12.4\,\,\pm\,\,0.5\) GeV). Therefore, the results quoted in this note for searches for hadronic jet resonances at high luminosity should be considered over-optimistic.

### Estimates of SUSY particles masses

In the study of exclusive SUSY particles decays, many kinematic distributions display a certain sensitivity to the masses of the relevant SUSY particles. In the absence of detailed fitting procedures, a crude but reasonably accurate estimate of the sensitivity of the relevant distributions to the mass of a given SUSY particle was obtained in the following way:

\(\bullet\) all parameters of the model were frozen except the mass of the SUSY particle under consideration. In particular, all rates and branching ratios were kept at the same value;

\(\bullet\) the statistical sensitivity of the shape of the kinematic distribution under study to the mass of the SUSY particle under consideration was then extracted using a Kolmogorov test [14];

\(\bullet\) the most relevant systematic uncertainties arising from the detector performance and the incomplete knowledge of the theoretical model were evaluated in a similar way;

\(\bullet\) in most cases, the mass of the LSP, \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\), was assumed to be known. Wherever relevant, the uncertainty due to the unknown value of \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\) was included in the final systematic error or estimated, assuming that an iterative treatment of the experimental data would allow to constrain \(\mbox{m}_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\) to a level where its contribution to the overall experimental error would be small;

The following assumptions were used throughout these studies wherever systematic effects were estimated:

\(\bullet\) the absolute energy scale will be known to better than 0.1 % for muons and electrons, and to better than 1 % for hadronic jets;

\(\bullet\) the systematic uncertainty on cross-section measurements (e. g. in the case of semi-inclusive signatures involving 4 b-jets) was taken to be \(\pm\) 15 % at low luminosity and \(\pm\) 8% at high luminosity, assuming that larger data samples would lead to some reduction of the theoretical uncertainties on production cross-sections.

## 3 Characteristic features of SUSY events

### Mass spectrum and dominant decay modes

For the SUGRA parameter choices of points 1 and 2, the SUSY particles are rather heavy, as shown in Tables 1 and 2, with masses ranging from \(\mbox{m}_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\sim 170\) GeV for the LSP, to \(\mbox{m}_{\chi^{\pm}_{1}}\sim\ 325\) GeV for the lightest chargino, to \(\sim\ 500\) GeV for left-handed sleptons, and to \(\sim\,1000\) GeV for the first two families of squarks and the gluino. The main differences between points 1 and 2, in the SUSY sector are for the squarks of the third family, \(\mbox{m}_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\sim 850\) GeV (resp.\(\sim 870\) GeV) and \(\mbox{m}_{\tilde{t}_{1}}\sim 640\) GeV (resp.\(\sim 710\) GeV) and for the heavier chargino, \(\mbox{m}_{\chi^{\pm}_{2}}\sim 760\) GeV (resp. \(\sim 530\) GeV) for point 1 (resp. point 2).

The other main difference between points 1 and 2, arising from the different values of \(\tan\beta\), \(\tan\beta\ =\ 2.0\) and 10.0 respectively, is in the Higgs sector: \(\mbox{m}_{\rm h}\sim 95\) GeV (resp. 115 GeV) for point 1 (resp. point 2). The other Higgs boson masses are all degenerate and very large, \(\sim 1050\) GeV for point 1 and \(\sim 740\) GeV for point 2, and therefore most likely not observable above the background at the LHC [15].

The gluino is slightly heavier than the squarks and this determines the main features of the SUSY particle decays shown in Tables 3 and 4 respectively. The gluinos decay mostly to squark-quark pairs, with a large fraction of \(\sim\,60\) % of decays into heavy flavours, \(\tilde{t}_{1}\)t and \(\tilde{b}_{1}\)b. The squarks are forbidden to decay strongly by kinematics, and therefore decay weakly to quarks and charginos/neutralinos. In particular, the right-handed squarks decay almost always to \(\chi^{0}_{1}\)q without any intermediate steps in the decay chain, thus preserving the typical signature of the very first SUSY models, i.e. events with few jets and large \(\mbox{E}_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\).

The lightest squark is \(\tilde{t}_{1}\), which decays to top-neutralino or bottom-chargino, with, however, branching ratios which are very different between ISAJET and SPYTHIA, as mentioned in section 2. For the studies reported here, the values from SPYTHIA were used, in particular for \(\tilde{t}_{1}\to\chi^{0}_{1}\)t decays.

For points 1 and 2, the hadronic decay modes of the charginos and neutralinos are dominant, in particular the channel \(\chi^{0}_{2}\to\chi^{0}_{1}\)h is open whereas the channel \(\chi^{0}_{2}\to\chi^{0}_{1}\tilde{\ell}\)

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:10]

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:11]

The \(\rm p_{T}\)-spectra of squarks and gluinos are quite hard, with average values around 500 GeV. The same is true for \(\chi^{0}_{2}\) and \(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\) produced most often in the first step of the squark/gluino decay chain, whereas the \(\rm p_{T}\)-spectrum of the h-boson produced at the end of the decay chain is significantly softer, with an average value around 200 GeV. Approximately 20 000 h \(\rightarrow\)\(\rm b\overline{b}\) decays are expected for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

The heavy SM particles, \(\rm t\), W and Z are also produced at various stages of the SUSY particle cascade decays. Top quarks are mostly produced in pairs, through \(\rm\tilde{g}\) cascade decays, with an average \(\rm p_{T}\) of \(\sim 300\) GeV. Approximately 15 000 \(\rm t\overline{t}\) pairs are expected for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

Pair production of W-bosons (\(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\) pairs, \(\rm t\overline{t}\rightarrow\rm WbWb\)) is almost as abundant as single production and the average \(\rm p_{T}\) of W-bosons is around 200 GeV. The production of Z-bosons is almost a factor 100 smaller than that of W-bosons for point 1.

Finally, Fig. 5 shows the expected multiplicities and \(\rm p_{T}\)-distributions of reconstructed jets, hard central jets, true b-jets and isolated leptons for SUSY events with \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}200\) GeV in the final state. Whereas the jet multiplicity peaks around five for all jets with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}15\) GeV and \(\left|\eta\right|~{}<~{}5.0\), the multiplicity of hard central jets with \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}100\) GeV and \(\left|\eta\right|~{}<~{}2.0\) is reduced to about 2.5.

The multiplicity of true b-jets is also large and the \(\rm p_{T}\)-spectrum of true b-jets is much harder than that of inclusive jets (this is to a large extent an effect due to the different \(\eta\) cuts applied). A significant source of true b-jets, in addition to \(\rm h\rightarrow\rm b\overline{b}\) decays, arises from \(\rm\tilde{b}\), \(\rm\tilde{t}\) and \(\rm\tilde{g}\) decays.

Isolated leptons, as already mentioned, arise predominantly from semi-leptonic W-decays and are observed in about 20% of the events.

Standard Model backgrounds

The SM background to the inclusive SUSY sample with \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}>200\) GeV, discussed in the previous Section for points 1 and 2, is a mixture of events containing high-\(\mathrm{p_{T}}\) neutrinos, either from \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production or from W/Z-boson production with associated jets. These SM background events can be divided into five categories, for which the production cross-sections and numbers of generated events are shown in Table 7 for generation cuts, which were optimised to efficiently provide unbiased samples of events with \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}>200\) GeV2. These events were generated using PYTHIA 5.7 including initial- and final-state radiation and hadronisation, and the detector performance was simulated using the ATLFAST package, as for the SUSY signal. Figures 6 to 10 show the multiplicities and \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)-distributions of reconstructed jets, b-jets (before applying the b-tagging procedure) and isolated leptons for the five categories of SM background with \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}>200\) GeV:

Footnote 2: As discussed in Sections 5 and 6, the final analyses all require \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}>300\) GeV or more.

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) production with, most often, at least one semi-leptonic W-boson decay leading to large \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}\). A large fraction of these events, of \(\sim~{}60\%\), therefore contains isolated electrons or muons, which can be used to reject them further if needed. The remainder correspond mostly to \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) decays and to \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) decays for which the lepton is outside the detector acceptance or non-isolated (in the case of electrons at least). The jet multiplicity in these \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events is quite high, around six on average, as shown in Fig. 6, but the expected number of events with at least two hard central jets is only \(\sim~{}30~{}000\) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), significantly lower than that expected for SUSY events in the case of points 1 and 2;

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{Z}+\)jet production with \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\nu\nu\) (Fig. 7) or \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) (Fig. 8) decays. The jet multiplicities in these events are much lower than for \(\mathrm{t\overline{t}}\) events and the peak around \(\mathrm{p_{T}}=200\) GeV in the \(\mathrm{p_{T}}\)-distributions is just a reflection of the cut requiring \(\mathrm{E_{T}^{miss}}>200\) GeV. Approximately 40 000 (resp. 4 000) events from \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\nu\nu\) (resp. \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\tau\tau\)) with two hard central jets are expected for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The expected rate of \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\nu\nu\) events with at least two true b-jets, mostly originating from gluon splitting, is about 5 000 events for the same integrated luminosity, much lower than that expected from SUSY events at points 1 and 2. The contribution from \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\tau\tau\) events can be further reduced, if necessary, using a lepton veto and a \(\tau\)-veto;

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{W}+\)jet production with \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\tau\nu\) (Fig. 9) or \(\mathrm{W}\rightarrow\ell\nu\) (Fig. 10). Approximately 50 000 events of each type with two hard central jets are expected for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). This rate can be further reduced using a lepton veto and/or a \(\tau\)-veto.

In summary, the SM backgrounds will most often be easy to handle when studying detailed SUSY signatures. The backgrounds from \(\mathrm{Z}+\)jet and \(\mathrm{W}+\)jet processes estimated using PYTHIA are underestimated by a factor of about two with respect to exact matrix element calculations [16], but in most analyses presented in this note the SM backgrounds are reduced to a negligible level after the final selection cuts.

Finally, instrumental backgrounds from mismeasured QCD multi-jet events have been shown to be negligible for the \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) cuts used in this note [4]. In particular, the exclusive analyses discussed in Section 6 all contain a cut \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\,>\,\,300\) GeV.

Inclusive selection

The main role of the inclusive analysis presented here is to clearly demonstrate that the presence of SUSY events and their main features will be easy to establish in the case of point 1, even after the first year of LHC operation. Table 8 shows, in terms of expected observable cross-sections, the evolution of the SUSY signal and of the five categories of SM background discussed in Section 4, after requiring \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}300\) GeV, as a function of possible additional cuts on jet, b-jet and lepton activity.

The very inclusive cut, \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}300\) GeV, retains about 63% of the SUSY events and the SM background is only about a factor of 3-5 larger than the signal at this stage (it is important to remember that PYTHIA usually underestimates the rates for W/Z + jet production).

The signal-to-background ratio is significantly improved by requiring two additional hard central jets (selection A), and, possibly, a lepton veto (selection B), but the SM background remains at the same level as the SUSY signal.

\end{table}
Table 8: _Expected cross-sections for the SUSY signal and the SM backgrounds for different semi-inclusive selection cuts after requiring \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}~{}>~{}300\) GeV. The low-luminosity b-tagging performance is assumed (see Section 2)._The use of the main characteristic feature of point 1, its abundant rate of final states containing two or more b-jets, yields much improved signal-to-background ratios, and, in particular, the requirement of two high-p\({}_{\rm T}\) b-jets, two hard central jets and a lepton veto (selection D) would lead to an expected rate of 2000 signal events with a SM background of \(\sim 15\%\), dominated by \(\rm\bar{t}\bar{t}\) events, for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), corresponding possibly to the first year of operation at the LHC. As shown in Section 6, a significant fraction of these SUSY events contain a bb pair from h-boson decay, the obervation of which would already significantly constrain the SUSY model.

### Inclusive \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) spectra

As will be shown in Section 6, the knowledge of the LSP mass, \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\), is an important asset for the extraction of SUSY particle masses from the experimental observables. The LSP always appears at the end of the decay chain of any SUSY particle, and, therefore, its mass always influences to some extent the kinematic distributions which can be reconstructed for a specific exclusive channel.

The inclusive \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) spectrum was therefore examined to evaluate whether its shape could yield any constraint on \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\).

Fig. 11 shows the differential and integrated \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) distributions for SUSY events with \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}>100\) GeV, for three values of \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\), the default value for point 1, \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}=168\) GeV, and two other values, \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}=268\) GeV3 and \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}=0\).

Footnote 3: In this case the values of \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{2}}\) and \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\) were also increased by 100 GeV to preserve the possibility of \(\chi^{0}_{2}\to\chi^{0}_{1}\)h decays and more generally the decay kinematics of point 1.

These plots do not show any convincing correlation between the shape of the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution and the value of \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\). This is illustrated more quantitatively by the numbers in Table 9, which clearly show that systematic uncertainties on the experimental measurements are very likely to obscure any small sensitivity of the distributions to \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\). It was also checked that stricter inclusive cuts, such as those described in Table 8, do not increase the sensitivity of the \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) distribution to \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\).

### Final states containing four b-jets

As shown in Section 3, points 1 and 2 are characterised in particular by an enhanced fraction of final states containing many b-jets.

Whereas the final states containing two b-jets are dominated by \(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) decays from \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{L}}\) cascade decays, the final states containing higher multiplicities of b-jets, in particular those containing four b-jets, are dominated by gluino cascade decays into heavy-flavour squarks and quarks:

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{g}}\to\mathrm{\tilde{t}_{1}t}\to\chi_{2}^{0} \mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\to(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b} })\mathrm{t}\mathrm{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\)

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{g}}\to\mathrm{\tilde{b}_{1}b}\to\chi_{2}^{0} \mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\to(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b} })\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\chi_{1}^{0}\)

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{L}\tilde{g}}\to\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{L}\tilde{q}_{L}q}\to\chi_{2}^{0} \chi_{2}^{0}\mathrm{q}\mathrm{q}\to(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{ b}})(\mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}})\mathrm{q}\mathrm{q}\chi_{1}^{0}\chi_{1}^{0}\)

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{L}\tilde{g}}\to\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{L}\tilde{t}_{1}t}\to\chi_{2}^{0} \mathrm{q}\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\to( \mathrm{h}\to\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}})\mathrm{q}\chi_{1}^{0}\overline {\mathrm{t}}\mathrm{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}}\)

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{\tilde{g}\tilde{g}}\to\mathrm{\tilde{t}_{1}t}\mathrm{\tilde{t}_{1}t}\to \mathrm{t}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{t}\mathrm{\tilde{t}t}\mathrm{\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{0}} \chi_{1}^{0}\)

The rate of events containing four b-jets will therefore provide some sensitivity to the gluino mass. In order to minimise systematic uncertainties, the ratio of this rate to that of events containing exactly two b-jets was studied as a function of \(\mathrm{m_{\tilde{g}}}\).

The number of events containing four (or more) b-jets, \(\rm N_{4b}\), was obtained by requiring:

\(\bullet\)\(\rm E_{T}^{miss}>\) 300 GeV;

\(\bullet\) a lepton-veto;

\(\bullet\) at least four tagged b-jets with \(\rm p_{T}^{b-jet}>\) 50 GeV.

The number of events containing exactly two b-jets, \(\rm N_{2b}\), was obtained by requiring:

\(\bullet\)\(\rm E_{T}^{miss}>\) 300 GeV;

\(\bullet\) a lepton-veto;

\(\bullet\) only two tagged b-jets with \(\rm p_{T}^{b-jet}>\) 50 GeV;

\(\bullet\)\(\rm\Delta R_{b\bar{b}}<\) 2.0;

\(\bullet\)\(\rm m_{bb}=m_{h}\pm\) 25 GeV;

\(\bullet\) at least two additional hard central jets, with \(\rm p_{T}^{jet}>\) 100 GeV and \(|\eta|<\) 2.0.

The tighter cuts used to define the two-b-jet sample make sure that the SM background to both samples is quite small, \(\sim\ 6\) % for \(\rm N_{2b}\) (as discussed in Section 6.2) and negligible for \(\rm N_{4b}\).

Tables 10 and 11 show, for \(\rm N_{4b}\) and \(\rm N_{2b}\) respectively, how the production cross-sections for the different SUSY processes and the rates of events passing the selection cuts described above vary with the gluino mass. These numbers were obtained by varying \(\rm m_{\tilde{g}}\) between 960 GeV and 1200 GeV, while the squark masses remained fixed at the values of point 1 (see Table 1). As \(\rm m_{\tilde{g}}\) increases, \(\rm N_{4b}\) decreases rapidly from 690 to 200, whereas \(\rm N_{2b}\) decreases much less, from 1335 to 965. As can be seen from Tables 10 and 11, this difference is due to the much larger contribution of events containing squark pairs, with an approximately constant rate, for \(\rm N_{2b}\) than for \(\rm N_{4b}\).

Table 12 shows the variation of the \(\rm N_{4b}/N_{2b}\) ratio as a function of \(\rm m_{\tilde{g}}\) for low- and high-luminosity operation4. The ratio \(\rm N_{4b}/N_{2b}\) can be measured to a statistical accuracy of 8% (resp. 2%) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (resp. \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)). The statistical uncertainties are much smaller than the assumed systematic uncertainties of 15% (resp. 8%) at low (resp. high) luminosity, due to the uncertainties on the production cross-sections, on the acceptances of the selection cuts and on the b-tagging efficiency (see Section 2.3).

Footnote 4: The main difference from low- to high-luminosity operation is a reduction of \(\rm N_{4b}/N_{2b}\) by a factor of \(\sim 0.7\) due to the lower b-tagging efficiency assumed at high luminosity.

From the numbers shown in Table 12, one can therefore conclude that this method would provide an estimate of the gluino mass with an accuracy of \(\pm 40\) GeV (resp. \(\pm 25\) GeV) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (resp. \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)). This measurement of \(\rm m_{\tilde{g}}\) will be combined with that obtained in the exclusive channel, \(\rm\tilde{g}\rightarrow\tilde{t}_{1}t\rightarrow\rm t\bar{t}\chi_{1}^{0}\), discussed in Section 6.3.

## 6 Exclusive selection

### Dijet events from \(\mathbf{\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{q}_{R}}\) production

As discussed in Section 3, one of the classical signatures for SUSY production is the observation of an excess of final states with large \(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and two hard central jets, which arise predominantly from \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{q}_{R}}\) production (\(\sigma\sim 400\) fb) and to a lesser extent from \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}}\) production in association with \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{L}}\) or \(\mathrm{\tilde{g}}\). At points 1 and 2, the \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}\to q\chi^{0}_{1}}\) decay corresponds to 99% of the \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}}\) decay branching ratio, and therefore this channel is not difficult to extract clearly from the other possible SUSY processes and decays. However, as discussed in Section 5, the SM background, which arises predominantly from \(\mathrm{Z}+\)jet production with \(\mathrm{Z}\to\nu\nu\) decay, is not easy to reduce to a negligible level.

The following cuts, tighter than the inclusive cuts quoted in Section 5, were therefore applied to extract the signal:

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>\) 400 GeV;

\(\bullet\) two hard central jets : \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}>\) 100 GeV, \(|\eta|<\) 2.0;

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{j}\mathrm{l}}+\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{j} 2}>\) 500 GeV;

\(\bullet\)\(\Delta\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{j}\mathrm{l}}>1\);

\(\bullet\) a lepton-veto;

\(\bullet\) a jet veto, i.e. no additional jet with \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}>\) 15 GeV (resp. 40 GeV) and \(|\eta|<\) 5.0 at low (resp. high) luminosity;

The above cuts correspond to the first column of Table 13 (resp. Table 14), which shows the contributions from the various SUSY and SM background processes to the total sample of events accepted by these cuts for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (resp. \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)).

The largest contribution from SUSY events to the background to \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{q}_{R}}\to\mathrm{qq}\chi^{0}_{1}\chi^{0}_{1}\) final states arises from single \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}}\) production (\(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{q}_{L}}\) and \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{g}}\)). For these background events, however, the shape of the \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\) spectrum turns out to be very similar to that of the pure \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{q}_{R}}\to\mathrm{qq}\chi^{0}_{1}\chi^{0}_{1}\) signal, since one of the jets is always from \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}}\) decay and the tight jet veto applied tends to select \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{L}}\) and \(\mathrm{\tilde{g}}\) decays with one hard central jet. For the study presented here, events from single \(\mathrm{\tilde{q}_{R}}\) production were therefore included in the signal, and Tables 13 and 14 show clearly that the remaining combinatorial background from SUSY processes is very small.

The SM background is still quite large at this stage, however, since it amounts to \(\sim\) 50% of the SUSY signal, with the two largest contributions arising from \(\mathrm{Z}+\)jet production with \(\mathrm{Z}\to\nu\nu\) decay and \(\mathrm{W}+\)jet production with \(\mathrm{W}\to\tau\nu\) decay. Further cuts were therefore applied, as shown in Tables 13 and 14, to reduce even more these two sources of SM background:

\(\bullet\) a \(\tau\)-lepton veto, which reduces the \(\mathrm{W}\to\tau\nu\) background by a factor two with negligible loss of signal (third column in Tables 13 and 14);

\(\bullet\) a tighter threshold on the two central jets, \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}>\) 200 GeV.

This last cut preserves more than 85% of the SUSY signal and rejects the SM background by a further factor two (fourth column of Tables 13 and 14), thus improving the signal-to-background ratio from \(2:1\) (resp. \(1.5:1\)) to about \(4.2:1\) (resp. \(2.9:1\)) at low (resp. high) luminosity.

It should be noted that a rather clean signal can be extracted in this difficult channel only by requiring quite severe jet veto cuts over the full calorimeter acceptance, \(|\eta\,|<5.0\), and with jet \(\rm p_{T}\)-thresholds set at the lowest possible values compatible with the assumed machine luminosity, \(\rm p_{T}~{}>~{}15\) GeV (resp. \(40\) GeV) at low (resp. high) luminosity.

As quoted in Section 2.2, the pile-up was not simulated explicitly, but it was included as an additional signal efficiency of \(80\%\), in rough agreement with detailed studies done for other processes in the calorimeter performance TDR [13].

At low luminosity, the jet-veto efficiency was found to be:

\(\bullet\) 32% for \(\rm\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{q}_{R}\) signal events;

\(\bullet\) 7% for other SUSY events;

\(\bullet\) 13% for \(\rm Z\to\nu\nu\) events;

\(\bullet\) 9% for \(\rm W\to\tau\nu\) events.

At high luminosity, where the \(\rm p_{T}\)-threshold was raised to \(40\) GeV, the jet veto efficiencies are higher:

\(\bullet\) 42% for \(\rm\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{q}_{R}\) signal events (including the \(20\%\) loss due to pile-up);

\(\bullet\) 11% for other SUSY events;

\(\bullet\) 28% for \(\rm Z\to\nu\nu\) events;

\(\bullet\) 21% for \(\rm W\to\tau\nu\) events.

Tables 15 and 16 show, respectively for low- and high-luminosity operation, the dependence of the SUSY signal and the dominant SM background sources on the \(\eta\)-coverage used to apply the jet veto. The signal-to-background ratio appears to depend only very weakly on the \(\eta\)-coverage used, and the rates are increased by a factor \(\sim 1.5\) (resp. 1.25) when going from a jet-veto applied over \(|\eta|~{}<~{}5.0\) to one applied over \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.0\) at low (resp. high) luminosity. The results quoted in this Section can therefore be considered as relatively stable with respect to the final optimal choice of jet-veto cuts.

Fig. 21 shows that, whereas the shape of the \(\rm p_{T}^{jet}\) distribution does not change very fast if \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{i}}\) decreases from 168 GeV to 0, it does change significantly if \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{i}}\) is increased to 268 GeV. As discussed in a separate note [8], the value of \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{i}}\) will be constrained to \(\pm\) 10 GeV (resp. \(\pm\) 4 GeV) within the SUGRA model, based on all the measurements presented in this note. These uncertainties on \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{i}}\) were assumed in Table 17;

\(\bullet\) the theoretical uncertainties on SUSY production, such as higher-order corrections and initial-state radiation (ISR). Fig. 22 shows that the \(\rm p_{T}^{jet}\) distribution is only very weakly sensitive to the presence or not of QCD initial-state radiation. This is not surprising since, as shown in Fig. 22, the \(\rm p_{T}\) distribution of the parent \(\rm\tilde{q}_{R}\) is very hard and therefore only marginally affected by higher-order QCD effects.

In conclusion, if the uncertainties in Table 17 are all added in quadrature, the \(\rm\tilde{q}_{R}\) mass at points 1 and 2 can be determined to an accuracy of \(\pm\)40 GeV (resp. \(\pm\)15 GeV) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (resp. \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)).

Events containing \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\rightarrow\chi^{0}_{2}{\rm q}\rightarrow{\rm h}\chi^{0}_{1}{ \rm q}\) decays

This cascade decay offers the cleanest exclusive sample of SUSY events for points 1 and 2. The reconstruction of \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) decays provides an accurate measurement of \({\rm m}_{\rm h}\), with a signal sample free of the large backgrounds from SM processes which occur for the electroweak \({\rm W}\)h production with \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) studied in [18]. Based on this clean sample of \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) decays, a partial reconstruction of the \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\rightarrow\chi^{0}_{2}{\rm q}\rightarrow{\rm h}\chi^{0}_ {1}{\rm q}\) decay chain can be performed, and, in particular, the invariant mass of the \({\rm j}\)bb system is quite sensitive to the value of \({\rm m}_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}}\). Finally, the \({\rm p}_{\rm T}\) distribution of the second hard jet selected in the event is sensitive to the value of \({\rm m}_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}}\) or \({\rm m}_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm R}}\).

#### 6.2.1 Reconstruction of \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) decays

As shown in section 3, about 20% of SUSY events contain at least one \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) decay in the final state. The vast majority of these events, \(\sim\) 90%, contain only one \({\rm h}\)-boson with an average \({\rm p}_{\rm T}\) of about 200 GeV. The following cuts were applied to extract a clean \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) signal above the SUSY combinatorial background and the SM background:

\(\bullet\)\({\rm E}_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}>300\) GeV (or 200 GeV in some cases);

\(\bullet\) two tagged \({\rm b}\)-jets with \({\rm p}_{\rm T}^{\rm b-jet}\ >\ 50\) GeV;

\(\bullet\) no additional \({\rm b}\)-jet with \({\rm p}_{\rm T}^{\rm b-jet}\ >\ 50\) GeV (or \({\rm p}_{\rm T}^{\rm b-jet}\ >\ 15\) GeV in some cases);

\(\bullet\)\(\Delta{\rm R}_{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}<2\) (this cut suppresses \(t\overline{\rm t}\) background);

\(\bullet\) a lepton-veto (also against \(t\overline{\rm t}\) background);

\(\bullet\) two additional \({\rm jets}\) with \({\rm p}_{\rm T}^{\rm jet}>100\) GeV and one of them at least within \(|\eta|\ <\ 2.0\).

Fig. 23 shows for these selection criteria, labelled as final cuts in Table 18 once an additional cut \({\rm m}_{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\ =\ {\rm m}_{\rm h}\ \pm 25\) GeV has been applied, the reconstructed distributions of \({\rm m}_{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) for the SM background, the total SUSY+SM background and for the summed \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) signal and background. As can be seen from Fig. 23 and Table 18, the SM background can be reduced well below 10% of the \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) signal in the mass bin, \({\rm m}_{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\ =\ {\rm m}_{\rm h}\ \pm 25\) GeV, after recalibration of the \({\rm b}\)-jet energies. With the final selection cuts, the SUSY combinatorial background can be reduced to less than 20% of the \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) signal.

Table 18 shows that the overall efficiency of the final selection cuts is about 20% with respect to the same cuts applied at parton level. These numbers are in rough agreement with those of the previous studies of \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) reconstruction reported in [17].

At high luminosity, the degradation of the \({\rm b}\)-tagging efficiency and pile-up effects reduce, the expected rates of \({\rm h}\rightarrow{\rm b}\overline{\rm b}\) decays, as shown in Table 19.

The \(\rm p_{T}\) distribution of the reconstructed \(\rm h\to b\bar{b}\) decays, \(\rm p_{T}^{b\bar{b}}\), displays some sensitivity to the mass of the parent \(\chi_{2}^{0}\), but also to the \(\rm\tilde{q}_{L}\) parent of the \(\rm\chi_{2}^{0}\). Fig. 24 shows the expected \(\rm p_{T}^{b\bar{b}}\) distributions for two values of \(\rm m_{\chi_{2}^{0}}\), \(\rm m_{\chi_{2}^{0}}=325\) GeV (default value for point 1) and \(\rm m_{\chi_{2}^{0}}=425\) GeV. Assuming \(\rm m_{\tilde{q}_{L}}\) is known (see Section 6.2.2), the mass of \(\chi_{2}^{0}\) can be measured to an overall accuracy of \(\pm\) 22 GeV (resp. \(\pm\) 9 GeV) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (resp. \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)), as shown in Table 20.

#### 6.2.2 Measurement of the \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\) mass

The SUSY signal sample selected in Section 6.2.1 contains a mixture of two processes:

\(\bullet\) about 70% of the events are \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm R}\to{\rm q}{\rm h}\chi^{0}_{1}{\rm q} \chi^{0}_{1}\to{\rm j}{\rm j}{\rm b}\bar{\rm b}+{\rm E}^{\rm miss}_{\rm T}\) with two b-jets from the \({\rm h}\to{\rm b}\bar{\rm b}\) decay, two hard jets and large \({\rm E}^{\rm miss}_{\rm T}\);

\(\bullet\) about 30% of the events are \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\to{\rm q}\chi^{0}_{2}{\rm q}\chi^{ \pm}_{1}\to{\rm q}{\rm h}\chi^{0}_{1}{\rm q}{\rm W}\chi^{0}_{1}\to{\rm j}{\rm j }{\rm b}\bar{\rm b}+{\rm E}^{\rm miss}_{\rm T}\) final states with two b-jets from \({\rm h}\to{\rm b}\bar{\rm b}\) decay, two hard jets, large \({\rm E}^{\rm miss}_{\rm T}\) and most often a \({\rm W}\to\ell\nu\) decay with a final-state lepton escaping the acceptance of the detector.

As shown in Tables 19 and 21, the SM background is very small and the total number of events expected is 1235 (resp. 8080) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\)\({\rm pb}^{-1}\) (resp. \(3\cdot 10^{5}\)\({\rm pb}^{-1}\)). The requirement of a veto on additional jets considerably decreases the available statistics but provides a pure \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm R}\) sample. As suggested in [6], the invariant mass of the jbb system corresponding to the \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\to\chi^{0}_{2}{\rm q}\to\chi^{0}_{1}{\rm h}q\to\chi^{0}_ {1}{\rm b}{\rm b}{\rm j}\) cascade decay is quite sensitive to the values of \({\rm m}_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}}\), \({\rm m}_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\) and \({\rm m}_{\chi^{0}_{2}}\). Since the events selected by the cuts described in Section 6.2.1 contain two hard jets in addition to the two b-jets from \({\rm h}\to{\rm b}\bar{\rm b}\) decay, two jbb mass combinations can be calculated per event. Fig. 25 shows this distribution with two entries per event (bottom) and also that of \({\rm m}^{\rm min}_{\rm jbb}\), the smaller mass of the two possible combinations (top). The distributions in Fig. 25 both display a rapidly decreasing edge around \({\rm m}_{\rm jbb}=750\) GeV, particularly so for \({\rm m}^{\rm min}_{\rm jbb}\): the position of this edge is a complex function of \({\rm m}_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}}\), \({\rm m}_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\) and \({\rm m}_{\chi^{0}_{2}}\), as explained in [6].

Figs. 26, 27 and 28 show the evolution of the shape of \({\rm m}^{\rm min}_{\rm jbb}\) as a function of the choice of \({\rm m}_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}}\), \({\rm m}_{\chi^{0}_{1}}\) and \({\rm m}_{\chi^{0}_{2}}\) respectively. Table 22 shows the contributions to the various uncertainties on the measurement of \({\rm m}_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}}\) from the \({\rm m}_{\rm jbb}\) distribution for integrated luminosities of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\)\({\rm pb}^{-1}\) and \(3\cdot 10^{5}\)\({\rm pb}^{-1}\). Whereas the statistical uncertainties on \({\rm m}_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}}\) are small and improve from \(\pm\) 15 GeV to \(\pm\) 5 GeV as the integrated luminosity increases, the total error on \({\rm m}_{\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}}\) only improves from \(\pm\) 30 GeV to \(\pm\) 15 GeV.

### Search for \(t\overline{t}\) pairs in SUSY events

The observation of a clean excess of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs above the SM background in a sample of SUSY events can be considered as a first step in the study of \(\tilde{t}_{1}\) decays and also of \(\tilde{g}\rightarrow\tilde{t}_{1}t\) decays. In fact, several cascade decay chains lead to such an excess of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs:

\(\bullet\)\(\tilde{g}\rightarrow\tilde{t}_{1}t\rightarrow\)\(t\overline{t}\chi^{0}_{1}\)

\(\bullet\)\(\tilde{g}\rightarrow\tilde{t}_{1}t\rightarrow\)\(t\overline{t}\chi^{0}_{2}\)

#### 6.3.1 Extraction of \(t\overline{t}\) signal in SUSY events

To select as large as possible a sample of \(t\overline{t}\) pairs in the SUSY sample for point 1, a pair of hadronically decaying top quarks, accompanied by large \(E_{T}^{miss}\) was required using the following procedure:

1) Initial selection criteria were applied to reject as throughly as possible the SM \(t\overline{t}\) background:

\(\bullet\)\(E_{T}^{miss}>\) 300 GeV;

\(\bullet\) a lepton veto and a \(\tau\)-veto;

\(\bullet\) two tagged b-jets with \(p_{T}^{b-jet}\ >\ 30\) GeV;

\(\bullet\) no additional b-jet with \(p_{T}^{b-jet}\ >\ 30\) GeV;

\(\bullet\) at least four additional central jets (\(p_{T}^{jet}>30\) GeV, \(|\eta^{jet}|<\) 3.0).

2) A reconstruction algorithm was then applied to the selected events:

\(\bullet\) all possible \(jj\) combinations (excluding those containing one or two tagged b-jets) are examined and the distribution of \(m_{ij}\) for the selected events is shown in Fig. 32. All jj combinations such that \(m_{ij}=m_{W}\pm 15\) GeV are retained. As shown in Fig. 32, the side-bands around \(m_{W}\) are also considered to estimate the combinatorial background;

\(\bullet\) for each accepted jj combination, consider each of the two possible jj combinations;

\(\bullet\) for a pair of jj combinations compute

\(\chi^{2}=(m_{ijb}^{1}-m_{t})^{2}+(m_{ijb}^{2}-m_{t})^{2}\);

\(\bullet\) select the pair of jj combinations which minimises the above \(\chi^{2}\);

\(\bullet\) for the jj combinations chosen, rescale their 4-momenta to impose the constraint \(m_{ij}\ =\ m_{W}\);

\(\bullet\) finally, compute \(m_{ijb}\) for each of the top-quark candidates.

If both jj combinations satisfy the cut \(m_{ijb}=m_{top}\pm 30\) GeV, the event is accepted for further analysis. Table 24 shows the efficiency of this reconstruction procedure for various SUSY processes and for the SM \(t\overline{t}\) background, starting from the selection cuts described above. The lowest efficiencies are observed for the SUSY processes not containing any top quark in the cascade decay chain and for the SM \(t\overline{t}\) background. This is not surprising since none of the SM \(t\overline{t}\) pairs selected by the above cuts can correspond to a pair of purely hadronic top-quark decays, due tothe very large \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\) required in the event. Most of the remaining SM \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events were found to be \(\rm W\to\tau\nu\) decays with additional jets faking the top-quark reconstruction. After applying a \(\tau\)-lepton veto, only 25% of these \(\rm W\to\tau\nu\) decays from \(\rm t\overline{t}\) production are retained.

One should also note that the overall efficiency of the kinematic reconstruction of a top-quark pair is only 3-5%, due to the complexity of the final state and to the large combinatorial backgrounds which are present for points 1 and 2. For normal \(\rm t\overline{t}\) events, with few extra jets, this reconstruction efficiency was checked and found to be higher, i.e. approximately 30

Fig. 32 shows a clean signal for \(\rm W\to jj\) decays, which is selected and associated to all possible b-jets in the events, as described above. The resulting invariant mass distributions for all valid \(\rm jj\) combinations are shown in Fig. 33. Whereas the SM background displays only very few events with \(\rm m_{jjb}\;=\;m_{top}\), the SUSY events obviously do present a clear signal for \(\rm t\to jjb\) decays with large \(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\). The peak in Fig.33 is well centred around \(\rm m_{top}\) and the side-bands of Fig. 32, corresponding to \(\rm m_{jj}\;=\;50\pm 15\) GeV and \(\rm m_{jj}\;=\;110\pm 15\) GeV, reproduce quite accurately the shape and magnitude of the SUSY combinatorial background to the SUSY \(\rm t\overline{t}\) signal.

Fig. 34 shows the \(\rm jj\) invariant-mass peak after background subtraction, both for the SUSY events and the small amount of residual SM background. For an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), approximately 400 SUSY events with a reconstructed \(\rm t\overline{t}\) pair (\(\rm m_{jjb}\;=\;(175\pm 30)\) GeV for both \(\rm jj\) combinations) are expected above about 40 events from the SM \(\rm t\overline{t}\) background. The more inclusive number of single-top decays is approximately 825 in total.

This sample of reconstructed top-quark pairs can then be used to:

\(\bullet\) partially reconstruct \(\rm\tilde{g}\to\tilde{t}_{1}t\) decays to estimate \(\rm m_{\tilde{g}}\);

\(\bullet\) select \(\tilde{t}_{1}\tilde{t}_{1}\) production to estimate \(\rm m_{\tilde{t}_{1}}\).

It should not be forgotten that the rates quoted above correspond to the more optimistic SPYTHIA values for the \(\tilde{t}_{1}\) decay branching ratios (see Table 3), and would be reduced by a factor of \(\sim 2\) if ISA JET were to be used instead.

3.2 Partial reconstruction of the \(\tilde{\rm g}\to\tilde{\rm t}_{1}t\to\chi^{0}_{1}t\bar{t}\) cascade decay

For this decay chain, the distribution of \({\rm m_{t\bar{t}}}\), for events with a reconstructed pair of top quarks and large \({\rm E_{T}^{miss}}\), is sensitive to the gluino mass (assuming a fixed value for \({\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}}\)) but quite insensitive to the value of the \(\tilde{\rm t}_{1}\) mass.

It is therefore desirable to select the \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm R}\tilde{\rm g}\) process, which has a production cross-section of 0.65 pb, to obtain as clean as possible a sample of \(\tilde{\rm t}\bar{\rm t}\) pairs from gluino decay. In fact, all processes (\(\tilde{\rm g}\tilde{\rm g}\), \(\tilde{\rm q}_{\rm L}\tilde{\rm g}\)) which result in one \(\tilde{\rm g}\to\tilde{\rm t}_{1}t\to\chi^{0}_{1}t\bar{\rm t}\) cascade decay and which do not produce any other top quark, can be considered as a signal for the measurement of \({\rm m_{\tilde{\rm g}}}\). The main background to these events arises from fake top-quark pairs reconstructed in events containing b-quarks and \(\chi^{\pm}_{1}\to\chi^{0}_{1}W\) decays, as, for example, \(\tilde{\rm g}\to\tilde{\rm b}_{1}b\to\chi^{0}_{1}Wtb\).

To reduce this SUSY combinatorial background, the events selected and reconstructed as described in Section 6.3.1 were required in addition to contain at least one additional hard central jet with \({\rm p_{T}^{jet}}>300\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.0\). Also, both jjb combinations were constrained to \({\rm m_{jjb}}={\rm m_{top}}\). As shown in Table 25, only 170 signal events containing one \(\tilde{\rm g}\to\tilde{\rm t}_{1}t\to\chi^{0}_{1}t\bar{\rm t}\) cascade decay and 100 background events (predominantly from other SUSY processes ) are expected after these cuts for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). Fig. 35 shows the variation of the shape of the \({\rm m_{t\bar{t}}}\) distribution as a function of \({\rm m_{\tilde{\rm g}}}\) for the larger integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). About 80% of the background to the signal is from single gluino production or gluino pair production, and, as for the signal, the rate of this background will be sensitive to \({\rm m_{\tilde{\rm g}}}\).

Table 26 summarises the sensitivity of the \({\rm m_{t\bar{t}}}\) distribution to \({\rm m_{\tilde{\rm g}}}\) and combines the measurement described here to that of Section 5.2, which uses the ratio \({\rm N_{4b}}/{\rm N_{2b}}\). In summary, the gluino mass can be measured to \(\pm\) 25 GeV (resp. \(\pm\) 12 GeV) for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\) (resp. \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)). This result assumes that \({\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{1}}}\) is known from other constraints to an accuracy of \(\sim~{}\pm\) 20 GeV.

#### 6.3.3 Partial reconstruction of \(\tilde{\mathrm{t}}_{1}\tilde{\mathrm{t}}_{1}\) decays

The extraction of \(\tilde{\mathrm{t}}_{1}\tilde{\mathrm{t}}_{1}\) pair production appears to be the only method to obtain a direct estimate of the \(\tilde{\mathrm{t}}_{1}\) mass. This process has a production cross-section of only 130 fb, and leads to \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\chi^{0}_{1}\chi^{0}_{1}\) final states in about 50% of the cases. After applying the selection cuts described in Section 6.3.1 to reconstruct the \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) pair in the final state, less than 100 events are expected for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

This channel will therefore only be observable at high luminosity. In addition, tight jet veto cuts are requested to reduce the much larger SUSY combinatorial background. After requiring therefore that no additional jet with \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\;>\;100\) GeV and \(|\eta|\;<\;3.0\) and at most one additional jet with \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet}}\;>\;50\) GeV and \(|\eta|\;<\;3.0\) be reconstructed, and that both b-jets have \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{b-jet}}\;>\;50\) GeV, a signal-to-background of about 2:1 can be achieved, but with a very low rate of 56 signal events above the background from SM \(\mathrm{t}\overline{\mathrm{t}}\) production, for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

Figure 36: _Reconstructed distribution of \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{top}}\) for the top quark with higher \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\), for the summed signal+background (solid histogram) and the SUSY+SM background (hatched histogram) as a function of the \(\tilde{\mathrm{t}}_{1}\) mass, \(\mathrm{m}_{\tilde{\mathrm{t}}_{1}}\) = 650 GeV (top), 750 GeV (middle) and 850 GeV (bottom), for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)._Fig. 36 shows the \(\rm p_{T}\) distribution of the top quark with the higher \(\rm p_{T}\) as a function of \(\rm m_{\tilde{t}_{1}}\). Even for a very high integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), a sensitivity of at best \(\pm\) 100 GeV on \(\rm m_{\tilde{t}_{1}}\) can be expected based on the \(\tilde{t}_{1}\tilde{t}_{1}\) sample discussed here.

### Search for \(\rm\tilde{g}\to\tilde{b}_{1}b\) decays

This Section describes the study of the \(\rm\tilde{g}\to\tilde{b}_{1}b\to\chi^{0}_{2}b\bar{b}\to(h\to b\bar{b})b\bar{b}\) decay chain, in an attempt to extract the \(\rm\tilde{b}_{1}\) mass. As usual, the cleanest signature would be obtained for the \(\rm\tilde{q}_{R}\tilde{g}\) process, but other more complex topologies containing the same \(\rm\tilde{g}\) cascade decay would also contribute to the signal. Since the branching ratios, \(\rm\tilde{g}\to\tilde{b}_{1}b\) and \(\rm\tilde{b}_{1}\to\chi^{0}_{2}b\) are only \(\sim 20\%\), the final states with four b-jets will only correspond to about 3% of the produced gluinos.

The following cuts were applied to select these events:

\(\rm\bullet\)\(\rm E_{T}^{miss}>300\) GeV;

\(\rm\bullet\) a lepton-veto;

\(\rm\bullet\) four tagged b-jets with \(\rm p_{T}^{b\to jet}>30\) GeV;

\(\rm\bullet\) one reconstructed \(\rm h\to b\bar{b}\) decay, as described in Section 6.1;

\(\rm\bullet\) one of the two b-jets not used for \(\rm h\to b\bar{b}\) with \(\rm p_{T}^{b\to jet}>200\) GeV;

\(\rm\bullet\) the same jet veto as in Section 6.3.3.

As in the \(\rm\tilde{t}_{1}\tilde{t}_{1}\) case, this channel has to be studied at high luminosity but the signal rates could be increased somewhat by relaxing the b-tagging cuts at high luminosity in order to preserve \(\rm\epsilon_{b}=60\%\). Since four b-jets are required in the final state, the background from mis-tagged jets should be very small. In these conditions, 130 signal events are expected above a background of 150 events from other SUSY processes, for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\).

The \(\rm b\bar{b}\) pair from h-boson decay can be combined to either of the other two b-jets to compute an invariant mass \(\rm m_{bbb}\), as shown in Fig. 37 for three values of \(\rm m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\). Fig. 38 displays the distributions of the larger and the smaller of these invariant mass combinations, \(\rm m_{bbb}^{max}\) and \(\rm m_{bbb}^{min}\), as a function of \(\rm m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\) and clearly shows that the difference between the two (on an event by event basis) is quite sensitive to \(\rm m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\). Fig. 39 shows how this difference, \(\rm m_{bbb}^{max}-m_{bbb}^{min}\), varies with \(\rm m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\).

In fact, the distributions of Fig. 38 are sensitive to \(\rm m_{\tilde{g}}-m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\)and \(\rm m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}-m_{\chi^{0}_{2}}\) and, as \(\rm m_{\tilde{g}}-m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\), increases from 50 to 350 GeV and \(\rm m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}-m_{\chi^{0}_{2}}\) decreases from 625 to 325 GeV, the \(\rm m_{bbb}^{max}\) and \(\rm m_{bbb}^{min}\) distributions come closer together and the \(\rm m_{bbb}^{max}-m_{bbb}^{min}\) distribution of Fig. 39 comes closer and closer to 0.

Since \(\rm m_{\tilde{g}}\) and \(\rm m_{\chi^{0}_{2}}\) will be determined to a good accuracy from the exclusive decays studied in the previous Sections, the value of \(\rm m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\) can be determined with an overall accuracy of \(\pm\) 15 GeV for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\), as illustrated in Table 27.

Figure 37: _Reconstructed distributions of \(\rm m_{bbb}\) for signal+background events (solid histogram) and for the SUSY background (hatched histogram) and for each bbb combination (two entries per event) as a function of the \(\tilde{\rm b}_{1}\) mass, \(\rm m_{\tilde{b}_{1}}\) = 850 GeV (top), 750 GeV (middle) and 650 GeV (bottom), for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{5}\) pb\({}^{-1}\)._

The reconstruction of \(\mathrm{h}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) decays in SUSY events has been demonstrated in Section 6.2.1. Most of these decays come from \(\chi^{0}_{2}\rightarrow\mathrm{h}\chi^{0}_{1}\) decays. However, one should note that, over a wide range of model parameters, there may be competing \(\chi^{0}_{2}\rightarrow\mathrm{Z}\chi^{0}_{1}\) decays, where the \(\mathrm{Z}\) also decays into two \(\mathrm{b}\)-jets with similar kinematics. The relative ratio of \(\chi^{0}_{2}\) decays into \(\mathrm{h}\) and \(\mathrm{Z}\) bosons depends on the parameters of the model and varies in particular with the sign of \(\mu\) and \(\tan\beta\). A measurement of the ratio of these decay branching ratios would thus help to constrain these parameters of the SUSY model.

If the \(\mathrm{h}\) mass is close to the \(\mathrm{Z}\) mass, it will be difficult to distinguish if the peak in the \(\mathrm{m}_{\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}}\) distribution comes only from \(\mathrm{h}\) decays or if there is a contribution from \(\mathrm{Z}\) decays. However the \(\mathrm{Z}\) can be identified in its leptonic decays and the \(\mathrm{Z}\) rate can be measured by counting the number of \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-},\mathrm{e}^{+}\mathrm{e}^{-}\) events in selected SUSY events.

The branching ratios with the different signs of \(\mu\) are given in Table 28 for points 1 and 2, with the other SUGRA parameters fixed. From the rapid variation of the \(\chi^{0}_{2}\rightarrow\mathrm{Z}\chi^{0}_{1}\) branching ratio as a function of \(\tan\beta\) and \(\mathrm{sign}(\mu)\), it is clear that a measurement of the ratio of the two branching ratios will provide good sensitivity to these parameters of the model.

A first study of such a measurement has been performed in the case of point 2 where both branching ratios are large and yield sufficient statistics to obtain good sensitivity for an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\) pb\({}^{-1}\). The rates of events containing \(\mathrm{h},\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) decays or \(\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\ell\ell\) decays were estimated in the following way:

1) The number, \(\mathrm{N}_{\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}}\), of signal events containing a \(\mathrm{h},\mathrm{Z}\rightarrow\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) decay was determined by subtracting the background under the peak obtained for the reconstructed invariant mass of \(\mathrm{b}\overline{\mathrm{b}}\) pairs, as shown in the upper plot of Fig. 40 for both values of \(\mathrm{sign}(\mu)\). The events were required to have:

\(\bullet\)\(\mathrm{E}_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\ >\ 300\) GeV;

\(\bullet\) at least two jets, not tagged as \(\mathrm{b}\)-jets, with \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\ >\ 100\) GeV;

\(\bullet\) two tagged \(\mathrm{b}\)-jets with \(\mathrm{p}_{\mathrm{T}}\ >\ 100\)GeV;

\(\bullet\)\(\bullet\)\(\Delta\)R\({}_{\rm b5}\)\(<\) 1.0.

2) The number, N\({}_{\ell\ell}\), of signal events containing a Z \(\rightarrow\ell\ell\) decay was determined by counting the signal in the reconstructed invariant mass of lepton pairs (electrons or muons), as shown in the lower part of Fig. 40 for both values of sign (\(\mu\)). The events were required to have:

\(\bullet\)\(\rm E_{T}^{miss}\ >\ 300\ GeV\);

\(\bullet\) at least two jets, not tagged as b-jets, with \(\rm p_{T}\ >\ 100GeV\);

\(\bullet\) two leptons of opposite sign and same flavour with \(\rm p_{T}\ >\ 10\ GeV\);

Figure 40: _For an integrated luminosity of \(3\cdot 10^{4}\)\(\rm pb^{-1}\) and for the model parameters of point 2 (\(\rm m_{h}\) = 115 GeV) with \(\mu\ >\ 0\) (left) and \(\mu\ <\ 0\) (right), distributions of the reconstructed invariant mass of \(\rm b\overline{b}\) pairs (top) and lepton pairs (bottom) for events passing the cuts described in the text._

Despite the significant mass difference between the Z-boson and h-boson, the signals from \(\mathrm{h\to b\overline{b}}\) and \(\mathrm{Z\to b\overline{b}}\) decays cannot be distinguished in the \(\mathrm{m_{b\overline{b}}}\) mass peak of Fig. 40, where about 90% of the events are from \(\mathrm{h\to b\overline{b}}\) decay. The ratio \(\mathrm{N_{b\overline{b}}/N_{\ell\ell}}\) can be expressed as:

\[\frac{N_{b\overline{b}}}{N_{\ell\ell}}=\frac{\epsilon_{b}^{2}\cdot(f_{h}\cdot BR (\mathrm{h\to b\overline{b}})\cdot\eta_{h\to b\overline{b}}+f_{z}\cdot BR(Z \to b\overline{b})\cdot\eta_{Z\to b\overline{b}})}{\epsilon_{\ell}^{2}\cdot(f_{ Z}\cdot BR(Z\to\ell\ell)\cdot\eta_{Z\to\ell\ell})}; \tag{1}\]

where \(\mathrm{f_{h}}\) and \(\mathrm{f_{Z}}\) are the branching ratio for \(\chi_{2}^{0}\rightarrow\mathrm{h}\chi_{1}^{0}\) and \(\chi_{2}^{0}\rightarrow\mathrm{Z}\chi_{1}^{0}\) respectively, \(\epsilon_{b}\) and \(\epsilon_{\ell}\) are the combined reconstruction and identification efficiencies for b-jets and leptons respectively, and \(\eta_{\mathrm{h\to b\overline{b}}}\), \(\eta_{\mathrm{Z\to b\overline{b}}}\), \(\eta_{\mathrm{Z\to\ell\ell}}\) are the respective acceptances of the selection cuts applied. These acceptances are very similar owing to the choice of cuts and the not so large mass difference \(\mathrm{m_{h}}\)\(-\mathrm{m_{Z}}\), and the ratio \(\mathrm{f_{Z}/f_{h}}\) can be extracted approximately as:

\[\frac{f_{Z}}{f_{h}}=\frac{N_{\ell\ell}\ \epsilon_{b}^{2}\ \cdot BR(\mathrm{h \to b\overline{b}})}{N_{b\overline{b}}\cdot\epsilon_{\ell}^{2}\cdot BR(Z \rightarrow\ell\ell)-N_{\ell\ell}\cdot\epsilon_{b}^{2}\cdot BR(Z\to b \overline{b})}. \tag{2}\]

The ratio of the number of reconstructed \(\mathrm{Z^{0}\rightarrow\ell\ell}\) in Fig. 40 for \(\mu<0\) and \(\mu>0\) is smaller than expected from the branching ratios in Table 28. This is because there is also a source of \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) production in the decay \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{\pm}\rightarrow\tilde{\chi}_{1}^{\pm}\)\(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\), which has a branching ratio of 31%. The \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{\pm}\) come from decays of squarks with a branching ratio of 1-4% depending on squark flavour for \(\mu<0\) and 2-5% for \(\mu>0\). Therefore, there is a larger fraction of \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{\pm}\) events in the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) peak for \(\mu>0\). The fractions of \(\tilde{\chi}_{2}^{\pm}\) decays in the \(\mathrm{Z^{0}}\) peak are roughly 35% for \(\mu>0\) and 10 % for \(\mu<0\). There is also a difference in cut efficiencies for the the two signs of \(\mu\) due to a small changes of the masses of gluinos and squarks. These mass changes reduce the production of \(\tilde{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{R}}\) for \(\mu<0\). For \(\mu>0\), the production of \(\tilde{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{L}}\tilde{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{R}}\) and \(\tilde{\mathrm{g}}\tilde{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{R}}\) is larger by 8% and the production of \(\tilde{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{L}}\tilde{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{L}}\) and \(\tilde{\mathrm{g}}\tilde{\mathrm{q}}_{\mathrm{L}}\) is lower by 8% than for Conclusions

The studies reported in this note clearly demonstrate that, for the values of the SUGRA model parameters of points 1 and 2, SUSY particles will be discovered by ATLAS in a variety of semi-inclusive channels with a very modest integrated luminosity of \(10^{4}\)pb\({}^{-1}\). In addition, a number of more exclusive channels can be clearly separated from the various backgrounds, thus yielding important constraints on many of the SUSY particle masses and ultimately on the model parameters.

A summary of the measurements of SUSY particle masses is presented in Table 29 for point 1 as a function of the integrated luminosity. As discussed in the previous Sections, the uncertainties in Table 29 include both the statistical and the systematic errors. In particular, the value of m\({}_{\chi^{a}_{1}}\) has been assumed to be constrained by an overall fit to the model parameters which is not described here.

Table 29 shows that the squark and gluino sector will be well constrained by the experimental measurements. The h-boson mass is assumed to be measured accurately at high luminosity through h \(\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decays. The heavier charginos, neutralinos and Higgs bosons, as well as the sleptons, will be very hard to discover at point 1 and 2 due to their large masses and low production rates.

Finally, Table 30 shows the results of a global fit of the experimental constraints provided by Table 29 to the fundamental parameters of the SUGRA model. The details of the fitting procedure can be found in [8]. The measurements summarised in Table 29 are sufficient to highly constrain all the model parameters except for m\({}_{0}\) (a feature characteristic of point 1) and A (a feature common to all points in parameter space, as explained in [8]).

In conclusion, the characteristic features of point 1 would allow a sufficiently broad and accurate set of measurements of SUSY particle masses to constrain the parameters of any SUSY model, provided the number of such parameters remains limited.
