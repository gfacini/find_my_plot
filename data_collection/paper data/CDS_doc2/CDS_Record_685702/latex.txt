The goal of the present analysis is:

* to study the impact of the crack between the hadronic end-cap calorimeter (HEC) and the forward integrated calorimeter (FCAL);
* to compare two different options for this transition region.

## 1 Description of design options

Two options are considered:

* option A -- a variant of the version implemented in DICE presently: the HEC-FCAL boundary is quasi-projective, the FCAL has three longitudinal cylindrical sections with radii 44.4, 48.4 and 52.7 cm. The distribution of the material for this option is shown in fig.1. A narrow crack (width about 0.1 in rapidity \(\eta\)) at \(\eta=\)3.1 is clearly visible.
* the FCAL (and HEC) has a cylindrical shape with all the three sections having the same radius
	- 40.7 cm. In addition, the FCAL is moved by 26.5 cm closer to the interaction point. The advantage of this option is a reduction of costs due to the smaller size of the hadronic tungsten sections. The outer edge of the backplane of the first (e.m.) FCAL section is at \(\eta=\)3.2. The e.m. end-cap calorimeter (ENDE) covers the region up to \(\eta=\)3.2 and the region \(\eta>\)3.2 is covered by the e.m. FCAL calorimeter at full depth. The distribution of material for this option is shown in fig.2. A noticeably wider crack is visible in the region \(\eta\)=3.1 to \(\eta\)=3.4.

The structure of the gap between the HEC and the FCAL is identical for both options: 10mm of liquid argon (LAr) + 6 mm of aluminium + 5 mm LAr.

There is one important difference between the geometry presently used in DICE and the geometry used in this study: the liquid argon in front of the FCAL supporting cylinder is replaced by air. In fig.3 the distributions of dead material at z\(<\)480.5cm for both options are shown. z=480.5cm is the position of the FCAL front end for option A. A large amount of dead material is in the region 3.3\(<\eta<\)3.6 due to the front flange and inner wall of the cryostat. The amount of dead material in front of the FCAL would increase up to 1.5\(\lambda\), if the LAr would be kept. This would lead to large energy losses (upto 10% of the jet energy) and would spoil strongly the FCAL energy resolution. Therefore a LAr excluder is required by all means.

## 2 Simulation and analysis procedure

The DICE95 (with the FLUKA code for the hadronic shower simulation) has been used to simulate the jet response. The study has been done at \(\eta=\)2.5 and 4.0 and in the region 3.0\(<\eta<\)3.5 in steps of \(\Delta\eta=\) 0.1. At each \(\eta\) value about two hundred single jet events have been simulated with energy \(E_{j\,jet}=\) 500 GeV.

At each \(\eta\) value the energy response distribution is fitted by a Gaussian distribution in the interval \(E_{0}\pm 3\sigma\), where \(E_{0}\) is the fitted position of the peak and \(\sigma\) is the corresponding fitted width.

For each of the calorimeter sections calibaration parameter \(\alpha_{j}\) has been obtained minimizing the following functional

\[F=\sum_{i=1}^{N}(\sum_{j}\alpha_{j}\cdot E_{ij}-E_{j\,jet})^{2},\]

where N is the number of events, \(\alpha_{j}\) is the calibration parameter of the section j and \(E_{ij}\) is the energy deposited in the section j in the event i. Only events with \(E_{0}-3\sigma<E_{jet}^{meas}<E_{0}+3\sigma\), are used in this procedure. The following calibration parameters have been obtained for the different sections of the calorimeters:

\begin{tabular}{l r r r r} ENDE(\(\eta=2.5\)) & 1.06 & 1.04 & 1.18 \\ HEC (\(\eta=2.5\)) & 28.8 & 29.7 & 34.8 & 36.8 \\ FCAL(\(\eta=4.0\)) & 92.9 & 133.5 & 138.5 \\ \end{tabular}

## 3 Results

Table 1 shows the sharing of the jet energy between the individual calorimeters at different \(\eta\) of the incident jet. At \(\eta\)=3.1 and \(\eta\)=3.2 (and \(\eta\)=3.3 for the option B) there is a strong sharing of energy between the individual calorimeters and, therefore, sizable energy losses are possible in this \(\eta\)-region due to the crack.

The calibration parameters obtained at \(\eta=\)2.5 for the ENDE and HEC and at \(\eta=\)4.0 for the FCAL have been used in the interval 3.0\(<\eta<\)3.5. The measured energy is below 500 GeV, because of the energy losses in the crack and in the dead material in front of the FCAL. The lost energy \(E_{lost}\) and its r.m.s. are shown in fig.4 and table 2. For the option A the maximal energy loss is observed at \(\eta=\)3.1. For the option B the energy loss is noticeably larger than for the option A at \(\eta=\)3.2,3.3. But in both cases the maximal energy loss does not exceed 30 GeV, i.e. 6% of \(E_{jet}\). This corresponds to a contribution to measured missing transverse energy \(E_{t}^{miss}\) of less than 3 GeV. This is rather small value in comparison to the usual \(E_{t}^{miss}\) cut applied, which is typically 150 GeV or more.

In addition, these energy losses can be taken into account if the calibration parameters are determined for each \(\eta\)-bin in this transition region separatly.

To reconstruct the jet energy, the energy response within a jet cone of \(R_{jet}=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\varphi^{2}}\) is summed. Here \(\Delta\eta\) and \(\Delta\varphi\) is the distance of an individual calorimeter cell relative to the jet axis in the \(\eta,\varphi\)-space. The energy deposited outside of this cone also can be taken into account applying a recalibration.

In the following jet cones of \(R_{jet}=\)0.7, 0.5 and 0.3 have been used. The calibration parameters have been obtained at each \(\eta\)-point separately and for each \(R_{jet}\). The mean measured energy is restored by this procedure, but the fluctuations in the lost energy worsen the resolution \(\sigma(E_{jet})\) substantially. The dependence of \(\sigma(E_{jet})\) on \(\eta\) is shown in fig.5.

Fig. 5a corresponds to the case with no jet cone cut applied, as relevant for the measurement of \(E_{t}^{miss}\) and \(p_{t}^{miss}\). The comparison between the two options shows that the energy resolution for option B is somewhat worse than the corresponding resolutionfor option A at \(\eta=\)3.2,3.3. But after integration over whole \(\eta\)-range and taking into account the pile-up spoiling effect, the difference in \(\sigma(p_{t}^{miss})\) for the two options probably will be hardly found.

To distinguish a jet in the calorimeter or to estimate its energy in this \(\eta\)-region one has to apply stringent cut on \(R_{jet}\) because of a strong pile-up contribution. As can be seen in figs.5b-d the difference between the two options at \(\eta=\)3.2,3.3
