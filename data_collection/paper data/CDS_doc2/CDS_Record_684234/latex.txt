**Determination of SCT Wheel Positions**

**Stephen Haywood (RAL)**

**Abstract**

In this note, I document the proposed final values of the SCT Endcap Wheel positions. In the interest of ensuring this note is written, I have focused on explaining the optimisation process and the results, rather than on a lot of comparisons and history.

## 1 History

There have been many attempts in the last five or so years to define the positions of the SCT detectors. Hopefully this process has converged now.

1. The penultimate round of optimisations was performed by Allan Clark, Tim Jones and Alan Poppleton [1].
2. As a result of the need for an "insertable" Pixel detector, it was necessary to remove 13 mm off the inner SCT Endcap detectors (W12).
3. In the December 2000 SCT Week [2], I showed that the reduction to W12 was tolerable, although not desirable.
4. In this meeting, it was shown that there were some benefits in changing the layout: moving the first W12 detectors (inner ring) from Wheel 1 to Wheel 2.
5. There was a lengthy discussion as to the advantages and disadvantages of this layout change. The decisions are documented in [3].
6. Nobu Uno showed how things might be improved by increasing the width of the W12 detectors. It was felt that there was not enough time to pursue these ideas, especially because the detector orders had been submitted.
7. Since December, there have been further small optimisations corresponding to: 1. The possibility to move the SCT Endcap envelope to lower \(|\mathrm{z}|\) by 3 mm due to routing of Pixel Barrel service along Pixel support barrel. 2. The possibility to move the 1st SCT Wheel to lower \(|\mathrm{z}|\) by an additional 3 mm (a total of 6 mm). 3. The optimisation of the position of Wheel 9 to accommodate its Patch Panel. This has resulted in rotating the Wheel about a vertical axis to allow the Modules to be placed at higher \(|\mathrm{z}|\).

The layout where the 1st ring of W12 detectors is placed on Wheel 1 is labelled as the "**Old Layout**"; where the 1st ring is placed on Wheel 2 is labelled as the "**New Layout**". To make comparisons meaningful, in all studies I have performed, the Old Layout was considered with reduced W12 detectors and was subsequently re-optimised.

### Reasons for Going to New Layout

1. Small improvement (0.4%) in coverage for 4 SCT space points. This is important for * LVL2 Trigger. * Pattern Recognition. * Track Quality cuts.
2. Avoidance of a clash between the Pixel Barrel-Endcap gap and SCT holes (0.6% improvement).
3. More room for complicated engineering associated with fixing SCT Inner Thermal Enclosure to front Wing.
4. Reduced services for Wheel 1 resulting from 2 not 3 rings of modules. This facilitates the design of the Patch Panel for Wheel 1, which has to fit in the relatively narrow space between Wheel 1 and Wheel 2.

The significance of the first two points is not overwhelming. The last two points were considered more important. While it was probable that a work-round could have been found for the Engineering constraints, the Engineering work was greatly facilitated by the layout changes.

Additional benefits which we subsequently identified are:

1. Wheels 1 and 7 are now identical (may reduce number of sets of tooling).
2. Because the Wheels are chained in a more natural way (i.e. Wheel 5 rather than Wheel 6 continues the \(\eta\)-coverage of Wheel 1 - see Section 3.1), the stereo layers of the 9 Wheels now go: u,v,u,v,u,v,u rather than u,v,u,v,v,u,u,v,v.

### Disadvantages of Going to New Layout

The big disadvantage is that the maximum \(|\eta|\) extent of SCT Barrel 1 and SCT Wheel 1 is similar. This means that the Wheels which continue the coverage of these two layers (Wheel 4 and Wheel 5) must be placed close together in \(|\mathrm{z}|\). The consequences of this are:

1. Less uniform spacing between SCT hits for tracks crossing Wheel 4 and Wheel 5. This goes against the belief that a more uniform spacing of measurements is best for Pattern Recognition.
2. Jumps in the maximal radial coverage of the SCT. This affects the track parameter resolution provided by the Precision Tracker.

The significance of Point 1 is hard to establish because it requires extensive studies and it is not trivial to understand the criteria which determine the success of the PR. The radial separation between hits will affect the ease of correct association. If one looks at the maximal radial separation between hits in the SCTfor the two layouts, there is variation with \(|\eta|\) due to the discrete nature of the disks. This is more uniform for the Old Layout, but it is swings and roundabouts and the net differences is probably small. The radial separation between the Pixels and the SCT shows a much smaller variation as a function of \(|\eta|\). For these reasons, it is not clear that the PR in the Precision Tracker should be any worse for the New Layout. What might be slightly harder is the association of Precision Tracker track-segments to hits in the TRT due to an increased extrapolation distance; but it is difficult to imagine that this will be a big effect.

Point 2 is easier to study. Szymon Gadomski has written a note [4] comparing the Old and New Layouts, looking at \(\sigma(1/p_{\mathrm{T}})\), \(\sigma(\phi_{0})\) and \(\sigma(\mathrm{d}_{0})\) both with and without the TRT. The results are that the differences are very small, and totally insignificant when the TRT is included. I studied the resolutions with finer separation in \(|\eta|\) and, in the absence of the TRT, saw that the oscillations in resolution are somewhat bigger for the New Layout, but integrated over bigger bins, the difference is small. Since the TRT provides a very significant contribution to the \(1/p_{\mathrm{T}}\) resolution (reduces it by factor 2 - see Fig 4.9 of ID TDR), it may be inappropriate to focus too much on the Precision Tracker alone.

## 2 This Work

### Work for Old Layout

The work reported in [1] relied heavily on a program written by Alan Poppleton. This sought to

1. Ensure optimal SCT coverage: goal \(\geq\)4 hits for \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\).
2. Uniform and optimal track parameter resolutions.

Alan's program incorporated a detailed description of all SCT detectors:

1. Bond Gaps (Endcap)
2. Castellation in z (Barrel) and \(\phi\) (Endcap)
3. Stereo twists
4. Tilt (Barrel)
5. Trapezoid detectors (Endcap)
6. \(\phi\)-offsets (Endcap)1 Footnote 1: These offsets were proposed at the time of the ID TDR to avoid gaps and lumps of material (cooling blocks etc) lining up. These offsets were never incorporated in the Engineering designs. This situation was resolved by a modified proposal for rotating rings of modules on Wheels [5].

The above allowed a distinction between single-strip hits and space-points. In addition, a variation of the beam-spot was considered.

### Work for New Layout

I decided to write a new program to study the layout, because * Alan's program was complicated and not intended for others to use (not a criticism!), hence there was a danger of overlooking some details, leading to mistakes.
* There was a danger of my being overwhelmed by the details.
* I wanted to add new features and checks.

As an initial cross-check, I compared results from Alan and my programs and found perfect agreement. Of all the details in Alan's program listed above (a-f), I only included the description of the Bond Gaps (a). I added

1. An updated description of the Pixels.
2. A description of detector inefficiencies - note used extensively.

### Sources of Detector Dimensions

* Information on Wheel positions and separation between active silicon rings either side of a Wheel (\(\pm\)14.2 mm) from Jason Tarrant.
* Information of Silicon detectors from a note by Tim Jones [6].
* Information on SCT Barrels from Vishal Francis (RAL).
* Information on Pixel layout from Dario Barberis.
* \(\sigma_{\rm vertex}=56\) mm.

I assumed cylindrical symmetry. Barrels were treated as complete cylinders with no holes (no gaps between modules) placed at their nominal radii. Wheels were treated as being made of rings whose radii were determined by the radii of the \(\phi\)-detectors at their centre line. The rings were located in z at the average of the positions for the \(\phi\) and u/v detectors and averaged over the \(\phi\)-castellation.

### Layouts

The layouts which are considered in this note are:

**Original**: The original layout before the reduction of W12 detectors by 13 mm and the subsequent changes.
**Old**: The Old Layout - 1st ring of W12 detectors on Wheel 1.

W12 detectors have been reduced and layout re-optimised by hand.
**New**: The New Layout - 1st ring of W12 detectors on Wheel 2.

W12 detectors have been reduced and layout re-optimised by hand.

Status at time of December 2000 SCT Week.
**Optimised**: New Layout, with Wheel 1 moved to lower \(|\)z\(|\) by 6 mm and optimised by program in July 2001.

The Optimised Layout (see Figure 2-1) corresponds to the **Final** layout of this note.

### Optimisation

The criterion I used to optimise the layout was to look at the efficiency associated with \(\geq\)4 SCT hits. Due to the simplifications in the description of the detectors positions, my calculations can only be considered accurate to \(\sim\)1 mm in R and z. This would seem adequate, bearing in mind other effects.

To determine the Wheel positions, I considered tracks coming from z \(=+2\,\sigma_{\rm vertex}\) - the configuration most sensitive to the gaps/overlaps between the "planes". The "rules" I used were:

1. Move Wheel 1 to lowest \(|z|\) - to minimise Barrel-Endcap gap, which is biggest gap in SCT.
2. Move Wheel 9 to highest \(|z|\) - to maximise \(|\eta|\) coverage.

Figure 2.1: **Final Layout**: upper (lower) picture shows rays from z = 0 (+2 \(\sigma\)) at intervals of \(\Delta\eta\) = 0.1. Bond gaps are just visible.

Since the Pixels define the upper limit of the \(|\eta|\) coverage of the Precision Tracker for tracks from z = +2 \(\sigma_{\rm vertex}\), there is no point forcing each of the last 4 SCT Wheels to go to the highest \(|\eta|\). Consequently, I have chosen to

1. Fix the maximal \(|\eta|\) of the last 4 Wheels to be the same.
2. Equalise the \(\Delta\eta\) gaps/overlaps between associated "planes"1 by moving the unconstrained Wheels.

Footnote 1: I include Barrels in the description “planes”.

Finally, to increase the separation between Wheels 1 and 2 and Wheels 4 and 5, I have chosen to

1. Move Wheel 2 (Wheel 4) as far from Wheel 1 (Wheel 5) as is possible, but still consistent with no gaps being introduced for tracks from z = +2 \(\sigma_{\rm vertex}\).

## 3 Results

### Eta Coverage of Final Layout

Figure 3-1 shows the \(|\eta|\) coverage of the SCT by "layer" as seen by tracks coming from z = +2 \(\sigma\). This picture has been used to optimise the layout. As tracks fall off one "plane", they are picked up by a subsequent one at higher \(|\eta|\). These form 4 layers, corresponding to the 4 "hits" specified in the SCT design:

**Layer 1**: Barrel 1, Wheel 1, Wheel 5, Wheel 9
**Layer 2**: Barrel 2, Wheel 2, Wheel 6
**Layer 3**: Barrel 3, Wheel 3, Wheel 7
**Layer 4**: Barrel 4, Wheel 4, Wheel 8

Figure 3-1 treats the SCT Barrels and Wheels as being "**solid**" - ignoring gaps between rings and bond gaps.

### Efficiency Definition

I define a "**hit**" corresponding to the point where a track crosses a detector "plane". The distinction between \(\phi\) and u/v strips is ignored. Extra hits arising from overlapping modules or rings within a given "plane" are ignored - their inclusion would give a false impression of the coverage.

The figure of merit which I have used for the optimisation is the **efficiency for \(\geq\)4 SCT hits** (in practice, I quote the inefficiency, namely one minus the efficiency).

The **inefficiency** is evaluated for tracks averaged with a Gaussian profile in z and for \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\). This gives a feel for the net SCT efficiency loss arising from the Endcap. As the SCT Barrels are treated as perfect cylinders (no modular construction), they do not contribute to the inefficiencies.

Figure 3-1: \(|\eta|\) coverage of SCT Barrels and Wheels by “layer” as seen by tracks from z = +2 \(\sigma\) (most pessimistic scenario). Barrels 1 to 4 are labelled by -3 to 0. Smaller (green) vertical bars indicate overlaps; larger (red) vertical bars indicate gaps. The “Barrels and Wheels are “solid” - gaps between rings and bond gaps are ignored. Thicker horizontal lines represent detectors which are constrained in \(|\eta|\).

The numbers included on the plots give the inefficiency integrated over \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\). i) is for “solid” Wheels; ii) and iii) include effect of gaps between rings and bond gaps; iv) and v) include Pixel hits.

### Observations

**Effect of 3% detector inefficiency**

This results in inefficiencies of the order of 4 layers \(\times\) 3% = 12%. This is much bigger than the losses due to all of the gaps. Further, these detector inefficiencies may correspond to single channel losses and hence may be much more tedious to handle than straightforward geometrical losses.

**Gaps between rings**

In most cases, the gaps between rings are negligible since the requirement that all rings are at the same radii means that if the gaps at one end are arranged to be small, at the other end, there will be significant overlaps of the order of 10 mm. This is shown in Figure 3-5.

**Optimisation**

This was done with reference to holes in \(|\eta|\) associated with the "solid" wheels. The effects of the bond gaps increased the inefficiencies by more than a factor of two - this is probably unavoidable, since some pairs of gaps inevitably will line up for certain combinations of (z\({}_{0}\),\(\eta\)).

**Wheel 9**

Wheel 9 can be moved by several cm without a huge effect on the efficiencies. This is because the wheel d\(\eta\)/dz varies quite slowly with z at large \(|z|\), but also I suspect because there are still gaps between Wheel 5 and Wheel 9 and so the loss at high \(|\eta|\) is compensated by gains elsewhere - this argument will only hold for motion of a few cm. While the result of changes to most of the disks by a few mm is small, changes by a few cm do result in significant losses. This is shown in Figure 3-6

**Maximum \(|\eta|\) reach**

Even with Wheel 9 shifted to lower \(|z|\), there is 4-hit SCT coverage up to \(\eta\) = 2.52 (2.48) for tracks from z = 0 (+2\(\sigma\)). The coverage provided by the Pixel system for z = +2\(\sigma\) extends up to \(\eta\) = 2.44 (2.37) for 3 (2) Pixel hits (at least, for the geometry which was appropriate at the start of this work).

Table 3-1: Inefficiencies (%) for different layouts.

Figure 3-5: Overlaps between rings as seen by tracks coming from various vertex positions (z = –2\(\sigma\),0,+2\(\sigma\)). Because not all rings are present, the overlaps between inner and middle (middle and outer) are not actually present for Wheels 1,7,8,9 (9). Therefore, the only real hole in the above is in Wheel 1 between the middle and outer rings for z = +2\(\sigma\).

Figure 3.6: The left-hand plot shows how the inefficiency for getting various numbers of hits varies as a function of the position of Wheel 9, which is given by \(z=2722\) mm - \(\Delta z\). The value used in the Optimised Layout is \(\Delta z=-11\) mm. For each value of \(\Delta z\), the layout was optimised. The 4-hit efficiencies are not so sensitive to moderate changes of \(\Delta z\), since losses at \(\eta=2.5\) are compensated by closing holes at lower \(\eta\) values. The 3-hit efficiency is more sensitive to \(\Delta z\), since any movement of Wheel 9 to lower \(z\) causes losses at \(\eta=2.5\), while there are few holes at lower \(\eta\) values. The right-hand plot shows the maximum \(\eta\) value covered by the SCT as seen from \(z=+2\sigma\).

## 4 Conclusions

An effort is underway to re-examine the ID performance. This is being done using the "New Layout" as described in Section 2.4 - this is fairly close to the subsequent layouts. Szymon Gadomski [4] estimated that the impact parameter resolution has degraded by 15-20% from the ID TDR layout. However, this is predominantly due to the changing the Pixel layout (especially the B-layer) and the beam-pipe. If the performance is considered to be unsatisfactory, it will be difficult to isolate the changes arising from the SCT changes. However, it seems to me that differences resulting from different plausible SCT layouts will be small compared those coming from the Pixel changes.

The "final" Wheel positions (centres of CF wheels) are proposed in Table 4.1. While numbers are quoted to a tenth of 1 mm, they should not be considered to be precise (nor critical) at the level of 1 mm.

While it is inevitable that there will be some holes seen by some tracks with particular (z\({}_{0}\),n), I believe the layout proposed here provides satisfactory coverage and is not too sensitive to small perturbation to the Wheel positions at the mm level.
