**Abstract**

In the theoretical framework of the Left-Right Symmetric Model and the See-Saw mechanism, we report on the discovery potential for a new neutral \(Z^{\prime}\) gauge boson decaying into two right-handed Majorana neutrinos (\(N_{l}\)'s) at the future LHC. The \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) signals have been simulated in the ATLAS detector, and the observability contours in the \((m_{Z^{\prime}},m_{N_{e}})\) plane are presented.

Introduction

Despite its remarkable agreement with the current data, the Standard Model [1] cannot be considered as a complete theory. For instance, parity violation in the weak interactions is introduced by hand and neutrinos are massless, despite the fact that they are elementary matter particles. However, in accordance with experimental data in the field of atmospheric neutrino oscillations [2], there is growing evidence that neutrinos should have very small masses. New data in unexplored sectors are thus needed for a better understanding of the neutrino mass issue.

The Left-Right Symmetric Model [3] is an alternative theory which restores the parity symmetry at high energy by extending the \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes U(1)_{Y}\) gauge group of the Standard Model to \(SU(2)_{L}\otimes SU(2)_{R}\otimes U(1)_{B-L}\) and by introducing three new heavy gauge bosons : \(W_{R}^{+}\), \(W_{R}^{-}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\). Furthermore, if neutrinos are Majorana particles, then the Left-Right Symmetric Model, together with the See-Saw mechanism [4], may provide an explanation for the lightness of the three left-handed neutrinos (\(\nu_{l}\)'s) by introducing three heavy right-handed neutrinos (\(N_{l}\)'s).

Direct searches for the production of \(W_{R}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) at the Tevatron lead to the following limits for the masses of the Left-Right Symmetric Model gauge bosons :

* \(m_{Z^{\prime}}>\) 630 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)[5].
* \(m_{W_{R}}\;>\;720\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) if the right-handed neutrinos are light or \(m_{W_{R}}\;>\;640\) GeV/c\({}^{2}\) if the right-handed neutrinos are heavy (but still lighter than 410 GeV/c\({}^{2}\)) [6].

The best indirect limits on the \(W_{R}\) mass come from :

* the searches for neutrinoless double beta decays, which could possibly be induced by the exchange of \(W_{R}\) and \(N_{e}\)[7] : \[m_{W_{R}}\geq 1.1\ {\rm TeV/c^{2}}\times\left(\frac{m_{N}}{1\ {\rm TeV/c^{2}}}\right)^{-\frac{1}{4}}\]
* the analysis of the contribution of the right-handed currents to the \(K_{L}^{0}\)-\(K_{S}^{0}\) mass difference [8] : \[m_{W_{R}}\geq 1.6\ {\rm TeV/c^{2}}\]

A theoretical analysis of the vacuum stability performed in [9] indicates that the right-handed Majorana neutrinos are lighter than the \(W_{R}\) boson. Also, in some supersymmetric extensions of the LRSM, a theoretical upper limit of a few TeV/c\({}^{2}\) for the mass of the new right-handed charged boson was derived in [10].

A detailed study of \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\), which is the most promising channel at LHC, was reported in references [11, 12]. It was concluded that, after three years of LHC running at high luminosity, the right-handed Majorana neutrinos can be discovered together with the \(W_{R}\) boson, if \(m_{N_{e}}\) and \(m_{W_{R}}\) remain smaller than 4 and 6 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) respectively.

Various physics processes involving a new neutral \(Z^{\prime}\) boson were already studied in reference [13], in a more general theoretical framework than the Left-Right Symmetric Model. It was shown that the most promising channels for the discovery of \(Z^{\prime}\) at LHC are \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to e^{+}e^{-}\) and \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) (despite its larger cross section, \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to q\bar{q}\) suffers from a huge QCD background).

In the theoretical framework of the Left-Right Symmetric Model, the production of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson and its decay into two right-handed Majorana neutrinos were already discussed in reference [14]. In this note, we present an updated study of the observability of the \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) process at LHC.

In Section 2, the main characteristics of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson and the right-handed Majorana neutrinos are presented, within the theoretical framework of the Left-Right Symmetric Model. In Section 3, the results of a sensitivity study for \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) at LHC and in the ATLAS detector are discussed, and we draw conclusions in Section 4.

## 2 Main characteristics of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson and of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos

In this section, we present the main properties of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson in the theoretical framework of the Left-Right Symmetric Model. Knowing its couplings to the fermions, one can then calculate the various branching ratios of \(Z^{\prime}\), which is essential for a correct estimation of the production cross section for \(Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\). The main characteristics of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos are also presented here.

### Decays of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson

In the manifest Left-Right Symmetric Model (for which the right-handed fermions have exactly the same CKM matrix and coupling constant as the left-handed fermions), the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson has the following vector and axial couplings :

\[g_{V}^{f}=\frac{+2}{\sqrt{cos2\theta_{W}}}(I_{3R}cos^{2}\theta_{ W}+(I_{3L}-2Q)sin^{2}\theta_{W})\] \[g_{A}^{f}=\frac{-2}{\sqrt{cos2\theta_{W}}}(I_{3R}cos^{2}\theta_{ W}-I_{3L}sin^{2}\theta_{W})\]

If \(\sqrt{\eta_{f}}=\frac{m_{f}}{m_{Z^{\prime}}}\), each partial width of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson is given by :

\[\Gamma(Z^{\prime}\to f\bar{f})=N_{C}\,\frac{g^{2}m_{Z^{\prime}}}{192 \pi cos^{2}\theta_{W}}\,\sqrt{1-4\eta_{f}}\,\left({g_{V}^{f}}^{2}(1+2\eta_{f}) +{g_{A}^{f}}^{2}(1-4\eta_{f})\right)\]

where \(N_{C}\) is a colour factor (3 for quarks and 1 for leptons).

However, note that this equation is only valid if \(f\) is a Dirac fermion. If neutrinos are Majorana particles, then the couplings between the fermions and the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson become proportional to \(2g_{A}\gamma_{5}\) instead of \(g_{V}-g_{A}\gamma_{5}\)[15].

Since the two Majorana neutrinos in the final state are identical particles, the partial widths \(\Gamma(Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\nu_{l}\nu_{l})\) and \(\Gamma(Z^{\prime}\to N_{l}N_{l})\) become :

\[\Gamma(Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\nu_{l}\nu_{l})=\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{g^{2}m_{Z^{ \prime}}}{192\pi cos^{2}\theta_{W}}\,4g_{A}^{\nu\,2}\]

\[\Gamma(Z^{\prime}\to N_{l}N_{l})=\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{g^{2}m_{Z^{ \prime}}}{192\pi cos^{2}\theta_{W}}\,4g_{A}^{N\,2}\,(1-4\eta_{N})^{\frac{3}{2}}\]

Note that \(g_{A}^{\nu}/g_{A}^{N}=tan^{2}\theta_{W}\simeq 0.3\) : \(\Gamma(Z^{\prime}\rightarrow\nu_{l}\nu_{l})\) is thus much smaller than \(\Gamma(Z^{\prime}\to N_{l}N_{l})\).

The default version of the PYTHIA 6.136 [16] event generator has been modified in order to include these couplings for the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson. The possible decay products of \(Z^{\prime}\) are a \(q\bar{q}\) pair, a \(l^{+}l^{-}\) pair, a \(\nu_{l}\nu_{l}\) pair, and a \(N_{l}N_{l}\) pair if \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\geq 2m_{N_{l}}\) (we assume that the \(Z-Z^{\prime}\) mixing angle vanishes : \(Z^{\prime}\) does not decay into \(W^{+}W^{-}\)). Figure 1 shows how the branching ratios of the various \(Z^{\prime}\) decay modes depend on the mass of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos (we assume that \(m_{N_{e}}=m_{N_{\mu}}=m_{N_{\tau}}\)).

### Decays of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos

If the mixing between \(W_{L}\) and \(W_{R}\) is negligible, and if the right-handed Majorana neutrinos are lighter than the \(W_{R}\) boson, then \(N_{l}\), when produced, immediately decays into a charged lepton \(l^{\pm}\) and an off-shell \(W_{R}^{*}\), which leads to the production of either a \(q_{i}\bar{q}_{j}\) pair or a \(l^{\prime}N_{l^{\prime}}\) pair, if \(m_{N_{l^{\prime}}}<m_{N_{l}}\). Note that, since \(N_{l}\) is a Majorana particle, it decays either into a negatively charged lepton \(l^{-}\) or into a positively charged lepton \(l^{+}\).

\[{\rm Br}(N_{l}\to l^{+}...)={\rm Br}(N_{l}\to l^{-}...)=50\%.\]

Figure 1: Branching ratios of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson decay channels when \(m_{N_{e}}=m_{N_{\mu}}=m_{N_{\tau}}\).

The \(N_{l}\to l^{\pm}l^{\prime\mp}N_{l^{\prime}}\) decays are minor processes, and they can thus be neglected in the following. This is easily done by assuming that \(m_{N_{e}}=m_{N_{\mu}}=m_{N_{\tau}}\), which also allows restriction of the number of additional parameters.

The default version of PYTHIA 6.136 has been modified in order to include the right-handed Majorana neutrinos with all their decay modes.

## 3 Observability of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson and of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos in ATLAS

The expected performance of the ATLAS detector are described in reference [17]. Starting from the output of PYTHIA, the ATLFAST 1.57 program [18] was used for fast detector simulation, with the same parametrization as in reference [11].

### Cross section for \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) at LHC

With the appropriate couplings for the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson, and with the right-handed Majorana neutrinos included in the PYTHIA 6.136 event generator, it becomes possible to calculate the total production cross section for \(Z^{\prime}\) at LHC. For this purpose, the CTEQ2L parton distribution functions [19] are used, and no K-factors are included. Knowing how the branching ratios of the various decay modes of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson depend on the mass of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos (with \(m_{N_{e}}=m_{N_{\mu}}=m_{N_{\tau}}\)), we can compute the cross section for \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) as a function of \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\) and the ratio \(r_{Z}=m_{N}/m_{Z^{\prime}}\), as it is shown in Figure 2.

Figure 2: Production cross section for the \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{l}N_{l}\) process at LHC. The three right-handed Majorana neutrinos have the same mass.

### Reconstruction of \(Z^{\prime}\) and \(N_{e}\) in ATLAS

The number of isolated electrons and hadronic jets which are reconstructed by the ATLFAST simulation code are displayed in Table 1, for \(m_{Z^{\prime}}=3\)\({\rm TeV/c}^{2}\) and for various values of \(r_{Z}=m_{N}/m_{Z^{\prime}}\).

For the low values of \(r_{Z}\), the number of isolated electrons is generally smaller than two, because the kinetic energy of \(N_{e}\) is so large that it is difficult to separate its decay products in the detector. The number of reconstructed jets is generally higher than four, because of the remnants of the \(pp\) collision, and because of the final state radiation of gluons in the decay cascades of the right-handed Majorana neutrinos.

If \(N_{e}\) is heavy enough, the final states to look for consist of two isolated electrons and at least four hadronic jets.

In order to reduce the effect of the final state radiation of gluons, we merge the additional hadronic jets with some of the four jets with highest \(E_{T}\), on condition that they are found inside a cone of a given radius \(\Delta R_{max}\) around one of these four leading jets. Two competitive effects must be considered here. If the cone radius is too small, then some hadronic jets coming from the final state radiation may be left apart. If the cone radius is too large, then some hadronic jets which do not come from the \(N_{e}\) decay cascade may

\end{table}
Table 1: Number of isolated electrons and number of hadronic jets in the final state for the \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) process. To be isolated, an electron with \(p_{T}>5\)\({\rm GeV/c}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) must be separated by \(\Delta R>0.4\) from any other cluster, and the difference between the transverse energy collected in a cone of radius \(\Delta R=0.2\) around the electron and the transverse energy of the original electron in the PYTHIA output should not exceed 10 GeV.

be merged as well. The optimal value for \(\Delta R_{max}\) was found to be 1.0, and we thus apply the following correction before reconstructing \(N_{e}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) :

\[\left(\begin{array}{c}\vec{p}_{j_{k}}\\ E_{j_{k}}\end{array}\right)_{corr}\ =\ \left(\begin{array}{c}\vec{p}_{j_{k}}\\ E_{j_{k}}\end{array}\right)+\sum_{n\geq 4}\left(\begin{array}{c}\vec{p}_{j_{n}} \\ E_{j_{n}}\end{array}\right)_{\Delta R(j_{nk})\leq 1.0}\]

where \(\Delta R(j_{nk})=\mbox{Min}\left(\sqrt{(\eta_{j_{n}}-\eta_{j_{k}})^{2}+(\phi_ {j_{n}}-\phi_{j_{k}})^{2}}\right)\) with \(k\) = 1, 2, 3 or 4.

Then, the assignment of the two isolated electrons and the four hadronic jets to their correct \(N_{e}N_{e}\) pair is done by choosing the \((e_{1}j_{a}j_{b}\,,e_{2}j_{c}j_{d})\) combination which minimizes \(\delta m(abcd)=|m(e_{1}j_{a}j_{b})-m(e_{2}j_{c}j_{d})|\).

As for the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson, it is easily reconstructed by calculating the invariant mass of the two electrons and the four jets.

Reduction of the background processes and estimation of the discovery potential for \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\)

All processes with two isolated electrons and at least four jets in the final state are potential sources of background. We distinguish between the processes coming from the Standard Model (referred to as background A) and the processes coming from the Left-Right Symmetric Model (referred to as background B) :

* background A : \(pp\to\left\{\begin{array}{c}W^{+}W^{-},\ ZW^{\pm},\ ZZ\\ t\bar{t}\to W^{+}W^{-}b\bar{b}\\ Z/\gamma^{*}\end{array}\right\}+\mbox{jets}\to ee+\mbox{jets}+...\)
* background B : \(pp\to\left\{\begin{array}{c}W_{R}\to eN_{e},\ \tau N_{\tau}\\ Z^{\prime}\to e^{+}e^{-},\ \tau^{+}\tau^{-},\ N_{\tau}N_{\tau},\ t\bar{t} \end{array}\right\}+\mbox{jets}\to ee+\mbox{jets}+...\)

In a first step, a cut at 200 GeV/c\({}^{2}\) on the invariant mass of the \((ee)\) system and a cut at 100 GeV on the transverse energies of the two jets with highest \(E_{T}\) are applied to suppress the background A without lowering too much the signal statistics. In a second step, a cut at 100 GeV is also applied on the transverse energies of \(j_{3}\) and \(j_{4}\), but only if it improves the ratio \(S/\sqrt{B}\). It is generally the case, except for the low values of \(r_{Z}\). When \(N_{e}\) is much lighter than \(Z^{\prime}\), the decay products of the right-handed Majorana neutrino are sometimes so close that the two quarks coming from the \(N_{e}\) decay can form a single jet. In such a case, \(j_{3}\) and \(j_{4}\) do not directly come from \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) and their transverse energy is thus rather small. As for the background A, the smaller \(m(e_{1}j_{a}j_{b})/m(e_{2}e_{1}j_{a}j_{b}j_{c}j_{d})\) and \(m(e_{2}j_{c}j_{d})/m(e_{2}e_{1}j_{a}j_{b}j_{c}j_{d})\), the smaller the average values of \(E_{T}(j_{3})\) and \(E_{T}(j_{4})\). As a result, for the low values of \(r_{Z}\), one is likely to suppress quite some signal without significantly lowering the background A when applying a cut at 100 GeV on the transverse energies of \(j_{3}\) and \(j_{4}\).

Among all processes of background B, \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\) is the one which has by far the largest cross section. In the manifest Left-Right Symmetric Model, one has :

\[m_{Z^{\prime}}=\sqrt{2\frac{cos^{2}\theta_{W}}{cos2\theta_{W}}}m_{W_{R}}\simeq 1.7\,m_{W_{R}}\]Therefore, the cross section for \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\) depends on the mass of the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson, and it is between one and two orders of magnitude higher than the cross section for \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\).

The \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\) process is usually easily suppressed by requiring that the two selected \((e_{1}j_{a}j_{b})\) and \((e_{2}j_{c}j_{d})\) combinations have very close invariant masses, except when the two electrons coming from \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\) have similar energies, which mainly occurs when \(r_{Z}\) is close 0.3-0.4 : in such a case, they can fake a \(N_{e}N_{e}\) pair when associated with four jets. In order to reduce the background B, we thus require that :

* \(0.8\,m_{N_{e}}\leq m_{inv}(e_{1}j_{a}j_{b})\leq 1.1\,m_{N_{e}}\)
* \(0.8\,m_{N_{e}}\leq m_{inv}(e_{2}j_{c}j_{d})\leq 1.1\,m_{N_{e}}\)
* \((0.9-0.2r_{Z})\,m_{Z^{\prime}}\leq m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{a}j_{b}j_{c}j_{d})\leq 1.1\,m_{Z^{\prime}}\)

For the calculation of the ratio \(S/\sqrt{B}\), the signal \(S\) and the background \(B\) are integrated over these mass windows. Here, we assume that \(m_{W_{R}}\) and \(m_{N_{e}}\) were already derived from the study of \(pp\to W_{R}\to eN_{e}\), and that \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\) was already derived from the study of \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to l^{+}l^{-}\).

When necessary (i.e. if it improves the ratio \(S/\sqrt{B}\)), we also require that :

\[m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\leq 0.9\,m_{W_{R}}\ \mbox{or}\ m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1 }j_{2})\geq 1.1\,m_{W_{R}}\]

Shown on Figure 3 are the reconstructed mass spectra for the two selected \((e_{1}j_{a}j_{b})\) and \((e_{2}j_{c}j_{d})\) combinations, as well as for the \((e_{1}e_{2}j_{a}j_{b}j_{c}j_{d})\) system, for both the signal (with \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\) = 3 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) and \(m_{N_{e}}\) = 1 TeV/c\({}^{2}\)) and the background.

Figure 3: Reconstruction of \(N_{e}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\) in the ATLAS detector when \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\) = 3 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) and \(m_{N_{e}}\) = 1 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) (an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) was considered). The expected background events are shown with dashed lines.

Here, with the cuts on \(m_{inv}(e_{1}e_{2}j_{1}j_{2})\) and on the transverse energies of \(j_{3}\) and \(j_{4}\), one obtains \(S=116\) (which corresponds to an overall efficiency of 18.5% for the signal) and \(B=135\) (with 19 events coming from the Standard Model background processes, and a rejection efficiency of 99.90% for the Left-Right Symmetric Model background processes). Therefore, one has \(S/\sqrt{B}\simeq 10\) : it is enough to validate the observation of \(N_{e}\) and \(Z^{\prime}\), but it does not allow an accurate measurement of their masses.

To further enhance the sensitivity for the low values of \(r_{Z}\), one should search for final states consisting of two high-\(p_{T}\) hadronic jets having a large electromagnetic component and matching a high-\(p_{T}\) track in the inner detector. In order to simulate such a situation with the ATLFAST code, we first search for two electrons with \(p_{T}>100\) GeV/c at the generator level and, for each of them, we look for the closest hadronic jet in the ATLFAST output. Then, we combine the two selected jets, demanding that their transverse energies be greater than 1 TeV, in order to reconstruct the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson. None of the background A events survive these cuts. As for the background B, the invariant mass of the two jets with a large electromagnetic component is usually very close to \(m_{W_{R}}\) so it does not significantly affect the sensitivity for \(Z^{\prime}\).

For a discovery, one must have \(S\geq 10\) and the signal must exceed 5 statistical fluctuations of the physics background (i.e. \(S/\sqrt{B}\geq 5\)) in the selected mass window. With 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity, the discovery potential associated to the final states with two jets having a large electromagnetic component is shown in open circles in Figure 4, while the discovery potential corresponding to the final states with two isolated electrons and four hadronic jets is shown in full circles. If one has \(r_{Z}>0.1\), then the \(pp\to Z^{\prime}\to N_{e}N_{e}\) process may be observed at the 5\(\sigma\) confidence level, if the masses of \(Z^{\prime}\) and \(N_{e}\) are smaller than 4.3 and 1.2 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) respectively. For the lower values of \(r_{Z}\), the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson can be observed up to masses of about 5 TeV/c\({}^{2}\).

Summary and conclusions

In this note, we have reported on the discovery potential of a new neutral \(Z^{\prime}\) gauge boson decaying into two right-handed Majorana neutrinos, as predicted by the Left-Right Symmetric Model and the See-Saw mechanism. For an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), \(N_{e}\) could be observed together with the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson in the ATLAS detector, if \(m_{N_{e}}\) and \(m_{Z^{\prime}}\) are smaller than 1.2 and 4.3 TeV/c\({}^{2}\) respectively, provided that the right-handed Majorana neutrino is heavy enough to allow good separation of its decay products in the detector. These limits have been derived in the theoretical framework of the manifest Left-Right Symmetric Model, where there is no mixing between the left-handed and right-handed gauge bosons, and where the right-handed fermions have exactly the same CKM matrix and coupling constant as the left-handed fermions. Also, we have shown that the expected event rate for this process at LHC is not high enough for an accurate measurement of the masses of these new particles. Nevertheless, if the \(Z^{\prime}\) boson can be produced on-shell by the next-generation \(l^{+}l^{-}\) colliders, it is likely that precision measurements will become possible for this process.
