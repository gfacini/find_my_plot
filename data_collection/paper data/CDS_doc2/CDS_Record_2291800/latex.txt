**ATLAS Insertable B-Layer readout chip**

The ATLAS Collaboration

The ATLAS Insertable B-Layer is the innermost pixel barrel layer of the ATLAS detector installed in 2014. During the first year of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in 2015, an unusual increase was observed in the low voltage currents of the readout chips. This increase was found to be due to radiation damage to the chips. The dependence of the current on the total ionising dose and temperature has been studied using X-ray and proton beam sources, and will be presented in this note together with its possible parametrisation and operation guidelines for the detector.

## 1 Introduction

The ATLAS detector [1] is a general-purpose detector at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, which was designed to be sensitive to a wide range of physics signatures, to fully exploit the physics potential of the LHC collider at a nominal luminosity of \(1\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\).

The Insertable B-Layer (IBL) [2] is the innermost layer of the ATLAS pixel detector [3], consisting of 14 carbon fibre staves each 2 cm wide and 64 cm long. The staves are tilted by 14 \({}^{\circ}\) in \(\phi^{1}\), surrounding the beam-pipe at a mean radius of 33 mm, covering a psuedorapidity range of approximately \(\pm\) 3. Each stave has an integrated CO\({}_{2}\) cooling pipe, and is equipped with 32 FE-I4 readout chips [4] bump bonded to silicon sensors.

The FE-I4 chip is manufactured in 130 nm CMOS technology with a pixel size of 50 \(\mu\)m (\(r\)-\(\phi\)) \(\times\) 250 \(\mu\)m (\(z\)), organised in a matrix of 80 x 336 pixels. Each pixel contains an independent, free-running amplification stage with adjustable shaping, followed by a discriminator with an independently adjustable threshold. The FE-I4 chip keeps track of the time-over-threshold (ToT) of each discriminator with 4-bit resolution, counted using an external 40 MHz clock. The FE-I4 chip operates by feeding a common power supply to analog signal amplifiers and digital signal-process circuits. The IBL records the combined low-voltage (LV) currents of four FE-I4 chips, referred to as a module group.

The IBL detector was designed to be operational up to the integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\). This corresponds to a TID in the order of 100 Mrad. The detector components are qualified to work up to 250 Mrad. The IBL received a TID of 1.4 Mrad in 2015. During the first year of the IBL operation in 2015, a significant increase was observed in the LV currents of the FE-I4 chips, and detuning of the threshold and ToT parameters was observed.

This note reports on radiation induced effects in FE-I4 chips observed during studies using X-ray and proton irradiation sources for various temperatures and radiation intensities, and on the parametrisation of the current flow change in the FE-I4 chip. Based on these results, an operation guideline of the IBL detector is presented.

## 2 Observation during 2015 collision run

During the operation of the IBL detector in the 2015 \(pp\) collision run at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, the initial LV currents of the FE-I4 chips were around 1.6-1.7 A per module group. This changed in the middle of September 2015 when the integrated luminosity rapidly increased; the LV currents then started to rise (see Figure 1), increasing by as much as 0.2 A in a single LHC fill. The increase in LV currents is greater at higher instantaneous luminosities, as shown in Figure 2, where the increase of LV currents are normalised per picobarn of delivered luminosity.

To protect the IBL detector from damage due to the increasing LV currents, the LV currents were limited to 2.8 A per module group, while the whole detector was switched off during one LHC fill due to safety concerns regarding the voltage transients on the supply services.

The increase in LV currents caused an increase in IBL module temperatures; this change in the thermo-mechanical condition of the IBL detector resulted in the change of the IBL distortion, and a clear relation between the module temperature and the distortion was observed [5].

In addition, the calibration of the FE-I4 chips for both the analog discriminator threshold and the target ToT were observed to drift rapidly, despite frequent updates of the calibration. An example of threshold and ToT drifts is shown in Figure 3.

Figure 1: An example of the low-voltage current drift of an IBL module group (four FE-I4 chips) from the middle of September until the beginning of November 2015. There are two levels of the current depending on the configuration of the front-end modules: STANDBY (lower level, not for data taking) and READY (higher level, for data taking). There are two long power-off periods on October 5–6 and November 3–4, plus a short power-off on October 3 and November 1.

Figure 2: LV currents increase per inverse picobarn of delivered luminosity as a function of the instantaneous luminosity in the LHC fill 4569 (02/11/15). Greater instantaneous luminosities clearly result in greater increases of LV currents.

## 3 Irradiation and electrical tests on the FE-I4 chips

### TID effects in NMOS transistors

The increase of the LV currents and the detuning of the threshold and ToT parameters of the FE-I4 chip were traced back to the generation of a leakage current in NMOS transistors induced by radiation. Each FE-I4 chip contains 80 million transistors. Out of those, 78 million are part of the digital circuitry, causing the current increase to be more prominent in the digital current than in the analog current. It has to be noted, that only 50% of the transistors in the digital part are NMOS transistors while the other half are PMOS transistors. However, the current increase described in the following is not present in PMOS transistors and therefore only the NMOS transistors will be described in more detail. A schematic of an NMOS transistor is presented in Figure 4.

As explained in Ref. [7], there are two main radiation damage mechanisms in NMOS transistors. The first mechanism is the trapping of radiation induced positive charges in the shallow trench isolation (STI) oxide at the edge of the transistor. Their accumulation creates an electric field that opens a source-drain channel, allowing a leakage current to flow through. The formation of this channel is presented in Figure 5. In PMOS transistors this channel is closed due to the fact that the radiation induced charges that get trapped in the STI are always positive.

The second mechanism is slower and involves the formation of trapping centres in the silicon-silicon oxide interface, which mainly traps negative charges. This process reduces the electric field induced by the charges trapped in the STI, reducing the leakage current. Annealing of the positive oxide charges can happen through thermal emission, causing holes to leave the silicon oxide. This process results in permanent annealing. A reversible annealing, however, can appear through electron compensation induced

Figure 3: The evolution of the mean and RMS of the measured threshold (a) and time-over-threshold (ToT) (b) over all pixels in the IBL detector as a function of the integrated luminosity and the corresponding total ionising dose (TID), as measured in calibration scans. The threshold was tuned to 2500 electrons and the ToT to 10 BC (one BC = 25 ns) for 16 k electrons. Radiation effects caused the measured quantities to drift as integrated luminosity increased, but short periods of annealing and regular re-tunings brought the mean values back to the tuning point. The detector was regularly retuned, and each marker type corresponds to a single tuning of the detector [6].

by tunneling of an electron from the Si substrate. The electron has the ability to tunnel back and therefore this effect is not permanent. Both effects are dependent on temperature and the applied electric field. The interface traps will not be significantly annealed for the temperatures the chips will be exposed to during operation [9]. When an NMOS transistor is irradiated, the radiation damage is initially dominated by STI trapping, increasing the leakage current. As the TID increases, the interface trapping increases and starts to compete with the STI trapping and thus the LV current reaches its peak value between 1\(\,\)Mrad and 3\(\,\)Mrad; at higher TID the interface trapping dominates and the LV current decreases towards the pre-irradiated value. This effect was found to be dose rate and temperature dependent, and it is referred to as the rebound effect [7]. The parametrisation of the radiation induced leakage current increase of NMOS transistors is described by a parasitic transistor along the STI in Ref. [8].

### Measurements of single FE-I4 chips exposed to X-ray and proton radiation

To quantify the effects described above in the FE-I4 chip operation mode, several irradiations and electrical tests were performed using X-ray [10, 11] sources. Measurements under different temperature and dose rate conditions have been performed, to quantify the dependence of TID effects on dose rate and temperature.

The purpose of first irradiation tests was to verify the rebound effect in the FE-I4 LV current at a given temperature and dose rate. Figure 6(a) shows how the LV current increases for a FE-I4 chip in data taking

mode as a function of the TID; the temperature of the chip was \(15\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\) and the dose rate \(120\,\mathrm{krad}\,\mathrm{h}^{-1}\). The LV current reaches its peak value at about \(1\,\mathrm{Mrad}\), while at higher TID the current decreases to a value close to the pre-irradiated value. A second FE-I4 was irradiated and showed that maximum values of LV current are achieved if a dose is delivered in a single irradiation. Figure 6(b) shows the increase of the current consumption of a single FE-I4 chip in data taking mode as a function of the TID; the temperature of the chip was \(38\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\) and the dose rate \(120\,\mathrm{krad}\,\mathrm{h}^{-1}\). After reaching the maximum of each peak the chip was annealed for several hours resulting in the observed partial recovery.

To quantify how proton irradiation affects LV current increase, a set of measurements were taken while irradiating the sample with a \(18\,\mathrm{M}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}\) proton beam [13]. Figure 7 shows the increase of LV current while the FE-I4 chip was irradiated. Two different irradiations were performed at room temperature, with two different dose rates: \(3\,\mathrm{Mrad}\,\mathrm{h}^{-1}\) (for the first peak shown in Figure 7) and \(4\,\mathrm{Mrad}\,\mathrm{h}^{-1}\) (for the second and third peaks shown in Figure 7). The measurements were performed in two steps with a week in between, during which the FE-I4 chip was powered off and left to anneal at room temperature.

In order to monitor the effect of the irradiation while the FE-I4 chip was powered off, during the second irradiation the FE-I4 chip was switched off for half an hour keeping the beam on. As in the case of LHC IBL irradiation, we observe the complete annealing during the irradiation in the beam with LV off. As seen the LV current reaches the maximum value at around \(1\,\mathrm{Mrad}\) and proves that at a given temperature and dose rate, the LV current measurements without annealing give the boundary current that the chip will always approach after annealing periods and re-irradiation. In case (as in Figure 7) the dose rate is increased for the re-irradiation, the LV current of the second and third peaks exceeds the boundary trend given from the measurements without annealing.

To quantify the influence of the temperature and the dose rate on the LV current, measurements have been

Figure 6: (a) LV current increase of a single FE-I4 chip in data taking mode, as a function of the total ionising dose (TID) [12]; the temperature of the chip was \(15\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\) and the dose rate \(120\,\mathrm{krad}\,\mathrm{h}^{-1}\). The LV current reaches its peak value at around \(1\,\mathrm{Mrad}\), while at higher TID the current decreases to a value close to the pre-irradiated value. (b) LV current increase of a single FE-I4 chip in data taking mode, as a function of the total ionising dose (TID) [12]. The temperature of the chip was \(38\,\mathrm{\SIUnitSymbolCelsius}\) and the dose rate \(120\,\mathrm{krad}\,\mathrm{h}^{-1}\). After reaching the maximum of each peak, the chip was annealed for several hours, resulting in the observed partial recovery. The fit performed on the first set of data (first peak) has been carried out by using the current parametrisation described in Section 4.

performed where one of those variables has been fixed and the other one altered. Figure 8(a) shows the result of three measurements, carried out on three different unirradiated FE-I4 chips. The dose rate was set to \(120\,\mathrm{krad\,h^{-1}}\) and the temperatures were \(38^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\), \(15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) and \(-15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\). Before irradiation the LV currents of the three FE-I4 chips were \(400\,\mathrm{mA}\) (at \(38^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\)), \(360\,\mathrm{mA}\) (at \(15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\)) and \(380\,\mathrm{mA}\) (at \(-15^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\)); the plot shows only the increase of the LV currents. For the measurement shown in Figure 8(b) the temperature was kept at \(+15\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) while the dose rate was varied; the plot compares two different dose rates.

The previous measurements showed that: i) at a given dose rate, a higher temperature of the FE-I4 chip results in a lower maximum LV current increase; ii) at a given temperature, a higher dose rate results in a higher maximum LV current increase.

To mimic the expected change of LV currents in the FE-I4 chips between operation in 2015 and 2016, two consecutive measurements, separated by a several hour annealing phase, have been performed where the temperature was raised by \(+20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) and the dose rate was raised by a factor of 3.5. The result is shown in Figure 9(a). Since the second peak is lower than the first one, the expected LV currents increase for the FE-I4 chips should also be lower than in 2015, even given the expected higher luminosity.

A two-step measurement at \(10\,\mathrm{krad\,h^{-1}}\) has been performed at a temperature of \(5^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) to investigate if this temperature is safe for operation. The maximum LV current increase was of the order of \(250\,\mathrm{mA}\), which gives a LV current increase of \(1\,\mathrm{A}\) per module group. The LV currents had an initial value of \(1.4\,\mathrm{A}\) and a safety limit of \(2.8\,\mathrm{A}\), thus a \(1\,\mathrm{A}\) increase is within the allowed range. In addition, the FE-I4 chips in the IBL detector have already been irradiated and annealed, thus the peak LV current increase would be below the maxminum value, as in Figure 9(b). This figure shows a reduced LV current peak after 4 hours of annealing.

Since sensor performance is generally better at lower temperatures, irradiation and electrical tests were also performed at a temperature of \(0\,^{\circ}\mathrm{C}\) to investigate the feasibility of operation at colder temperatures.

Figure 7: LV current in a single FE-I4 chip during proton irradiation as a function of the total ionising dose delivered to the FE-I4 chip. The LV current is shown for the analog and digital part of the FE-I4 chip, the sum of the two is also reported and is labeled as total current in the plot. The LV current was monitored both during the irradiation and for about an hour afterward, showing an annealing effect. The FE-I4 chip was at room temperature and the dose rate was \(3\,\mathrm{Mrad\,h^{-1}}\) for the first irradiation and \(4\,\mathrm{Mrad\,h^{-1}}\) for the following campaign. The measurement was made in two steps, separated by one week in which the FE-I4 chip was not powered and left at room temperature. During the second irradiation, the FE-I4 chip was switched off for half an hour while the irradiation continued. In this measurement, the FE-I4 chip was irradiated with a \(18\,\mathrm{MeV}\) proton beam [13].

In addition the effect of multiple annealing steps on peak LV current was investigated. At this temperature, the first two consecutive peaks of the LV current increase exceeded the maximum current allowed for a safe detector operation. Therefore, it was decided to set 5\({}^{\circ}\)C as minimum temperature for a safe and successful data taking.

(a) Lab measurements carried out at 38\({}^{\circ}\)C (in blue), at 15\({}^{\circ}\)C (in black) and at \(-\)15\({}^{\circ}\)C (in red) with a dose rate of 120\(\,\)krad\(\,\)h\({}^{-1}\). The LV current of a single FE-I4 chip before irradiation was 400\(\,\)mA (at 38\({}^{\circ}\)C), 360\(\,\)mA (at 15\({}^{\circ}\)C) and 380\(\,\)mA (at \(-\)15\({}^{\circ}\)C).

The LV current of the single FE-I4 chip before irradiation was 380\(\,\)mA (420\(\,\)krad\(\,\)h\({}^{-1}\)) and 360\(\,\)mA (120\(\,\)krad\(\,\)h\({}^{-1}\)).

The LV current of a single FE-I4 chip before irradiation was 380\(\,\)mA (first step) and 550\(\,\)mA (second step). (b) The dose was applied in two consecutive irradiations. The temperature of the chip was kept at 5\({}^{\circ}\)C and the dose rate was 10\(\,\)krad\(\,\)h\({}^{-1}\). There was a 4 hour annealing period between irradiation campaigns, with the chip being powered off but the beam remaining on, resulting in the observed recovery. The LV current of the single FE-I4 chip before irradiation was 376\(\,\)mA.

## 4 Leakage current parametrisation

From the measurement results and previous publications about the LV current increase in NMOS transistors it can be concluded that the LV current increase is the result of the sum of the LV current increase inside the transistors of the front-end chip. A detailed derivation of the formulas discussed in this Section can be found in Ref. [8]. The origin of this LV current increase is the parasitic transistors along the shallow trench isolation. To describe their behaviour one can use the transfer characteristics of a parasitic transistor, where the LV current is zero as long as the gate Voltage \(V_{\text{G}}\) is smaller than the threshold voltage \(V_{\text{thr}}\). If the gate to source voltage is bigger than the threshold voltage, the drain current \(I_{\text{D}}\) in saturation mode can be described as:

\[I_{\text{D}}\approx K^{\prime}\cdot(V_{\text{G}}-V_{\text{thr}})^{2} \tag{1}\]

The main change of the leakage current in NMOS transistors is driven by the number of oxide charges \(N_{\text{ox}}\) accumulated in the \(SiO_{2}\) and the number of interface traps \(N_{\text{if}}\) activated at the \(Si-SiO_{2}\) interface. For p-type silicon the oxide charges increase the leakage current whereas the interface traps lead to a decrease of the leakage current. Therefore the gate voltage of the parasitic transistors can be described by the effective number of charges \(N_{\text{eff}}\) and the threshold voltage by the threshold number of charges \(N_{\text{thr}}\).

The effective number of charges \(N_{\text{eff}}\) is derived from 4 and 5:

\[N_{\text{eff}}=N_{ox}-N_{if} \tag{2}\]

Based on this the leakage current can be described as:

\[I_{\text{leak}}=I_{leak}^{0}+K\cdot(N_{\text{eff}}-N_{\text{thr}})^{2} \tag{3}\]

The number of positive charges \(N_{\text{ox}}\) defines the electrical field caused by the space charges in the silicon oxide. This number increases linearly with TID and decreases exponentially with time due to diffusion. The trend can be described as:

\[N_{\text{ox}}(t)=k_{\text{ox}}D\cdot\tau_{ox}\cdot\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{ox }}}\right) \tag{4}\]

The negative charges get activated by the accumulated positive charges. The number of interface traps \(N_{\text{if}}\) is a function of time in dependence of TID and can be described as:

\[N_{\text{if}}\left(t\right)=k_{if}D\cdot\tau_{if}\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{if }}}\right) \tag{5}\]

The trend of oxide charges and interface traps is shown in Figure 10.

For the resulting leakage current of the front-end chip one has to sum up the current consumption before irradiation with current increase:

\[I_{leak}=I_{leak}^{0}+K\cdot\left[k_{ox}D\cdot\tau_{ox}\cdot\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{ \tau_{ox}}}\right)-k_{if}D\cdot\tau_{if}\cdot\left(1-e^{-\frac{t}{\tau_{if}}} \right)-N_{thr}\right]^{2} \tag{6}\]

With these assumptions the formula was fitted to the data resulting in the plot shown in Figure 10. In a second attempt, the formulas were used to predict the maximum current increase in several consecutive measurements. Therefore it is assumed that a fit to the first peak gives a boundary current which following irradiation steps will not exceed. The result of this fit is shown in Figure 6(b).

After confirming that the parametrisation describes the data well, the fit was performed for other measurements resulting in the values shown in Table 2. Some of the parameters are given by the measurement conditions, notably as temperature \(T\), dose rate \(D\) and the current before irradiation \(I_{leak}^{0}\).

The model includes several free parameters, which leads to partially non-conclusive results when fitting them and yields errors in the same order of magnitude as the values themself. These results will be improved with more statistics, which will allow to fix several of the free parameters.

So far the data indicate that the number of trapped holes \(k_{ox}\) that is generated per dose unit is lower for lower temperatures. This behaviour can be explained by the hypothesis that the generated number of holes is temperature-independent but the probability for recombination of the electron-hole pairs is higher at lower temperatures. This would lead to a lower number of holes at low temperatures.

The threshold number \(N_{thr}\) increases with decreasing temperature at a fixed dose rate. To verify the influence of the dose rate on this value, more measurements at different dose rates and constant temperatures are needed.

The lifetime \(\tau\) of the oxide charges and interface traps can not be quantified with the data accumulated so far. To decrease the number of free parameters, a fixed value for the lifetime independent of the temperature needs to be defined, which can be achieved with pulsed irradiation measurements.

In summary it can be said that the first attempt of parameterising the current data works within reasonable

Figure 10: Number of interface traps (black line) and number of positive charges in the oxide (green line) as a function of time in arbitrary units.

limits. The number of free parameters will be decreased with increasing statistics and dedicated measurements to define the behaviour of those parameters. This will give the possibility to use the model to predict the maximum current at a given dose rate and temperature.

## 5 Detector operation guideline

Following observations from the first year of \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV in 2015 and after careful considerations, the safety limit for the IBL LV currents was raised from 2.8 A to 3 A for module groups of four chips, allowing a current consumption of 750 mA per chip. Since the average current consumption for a single FE-I4 chip is about 400 mA before irradiation, the current increase due to TID effects cannot

be larger than 350 mA per chip.

Since the first set of measurements performed at high dose rates showed that a higher temperature results in a lower current increase, the IBL operation temperature was raised from \(-\) 10\({}^{\circ}\)C to \(+\) 15\({}^{\circ}\)C. In addition, the digital supply voltage (\(V_{D}\)) was lowered from 1.2 V to 1 V in order to decrease the LV currents. The analog supply voltage (\(V_{A}\)) was not lowered since it would affect the amplifiers' gain and discriminator thresholds and thus require dedicated calibration procedures. With this configuration the increase of the current per module was only 150 mA after the dose of 0.9 Mrad. Given the results of the irradiation tests, it was decided to lower the IBL temperature to 5\({}^{\circ}\)C in order to avoid a negativ impact of the warm temperatures on the sensors which would result in an increase of their depletion voltage later on.

Thanks to dedicated measurements at 5 \({}^{\circ}\)C and at a dose rate comparable to the LHC in 2016 (10 krad h\({}^{-1}\)), it was proven that the current increase is around 250 mA per chip, below the safety limit of 350 mA per chip. Therefore operating the IBL detector at 5 \({}^{\circ}\)C is safe with respect to the expected luminosity in 2016, and the temperature of the IBL cooling system was lowered to a set point of 5 \({}^{\circ}\)C. The digital supply voltage \(V_{D}\) was raised from 1 V to 1.2 V after an accumulated dose of \(\sim\)5 Mrad, to reduce the number of chip single event upset (SEU) and readout errors at high rates. As the measurements show, this change occurred beyond the high peak region for the current consumption.

An overview of the mean LV currents as a function of integrated luminosity and TID during stable beam is shown in Figure 11. The values of LV currents are averaged for all modules across 100 luminosity blocks (where a luminosity block is the time period corresponding to one minute of data taking). The changes in digital supply voltage (\(V_{D}\)) and the temperature (\(T_{Set}\)) are highlighted. In addition, since the shift of the tuning parameters can be seen even at low dose rates and warmer temperatures, regular retuning was performed.

Changes in digital voltage (\(V_{D}\)) are highlighted. The set temperatures (\(T_{Set}\)) of the modules correspond to actual module temperatures of about \(-\)5\({}^{\circ}\)C, 20\({}^{\circ}\)C and 10\({}^{\circ}\)C [14].

## 6 Conclusion

The ATLAS IBL detector was installed into the ATLAS experiment in 2014 and has been in operation since 2015. During the first year of IBL operation, an increase of the low-voltage currents of the FE-I4 chips leading to operational issues and the drifting of tuning parameters were traced back to the generation of radiation induced current in NMOS transistors. Dedicated lab-test measurements of irradiated FE-I4 chips showed that the increase of the leakage currents reaches a peak value between 1 Mrad and 3 Mrad; the current decreases again at high radiation doses to a value close to the pre-irradiated value. Our studies demonstrate that optimum IBL operating conditions with high data taking efficiency can be maintained by continuous tuning of both temperature and digital supply voltage, even away from nominal settings.
