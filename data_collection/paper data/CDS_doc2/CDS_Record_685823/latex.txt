**ATLAS Internal Note**

**GEN-NO-009**

**16 September 1994**

## 1 Preamble

The ATLAS Organization shall be guided by the following principles:

* democracy;
* separation of policy-making and executive powers;
* minimal formal organization;
* limited terms of office.

## 2 Plenary Meeting

The Plenary Meeting is the forum of the all-hands discussion. All major ATLAS decisions concerning

* physics objectives and results;
* hardware and software design;
* organizational matters

must be discussed in the Plenary Meeting and, if appropriate, in its subordinate Working Group Meetings.

## 3 Collaboration Board

The Collaboration Board is the policy- and decision-making body of the ATLAS Collaboration.

Typical tasks of the Collaboration Board will be:

* decisions on the global detector design;* policy matters (guidelines for the interaction with the LHC Committee and the CERN Management, publications, presentations etc.);
* financial and human resources;
* elections;
* ATLAS organization;
* ATLAS membership.

Members of the Collaboration Board are:

* in general one representative per institution; however, institutions may have, at their discretion, up to two representatives;
* members of the Executive Board (_ex officio_).

Each participating institution has one and only one vote.

Decisions require a 2/3 majority of the institutions represented during the vote. A quorum of 50% (including procurations) is required. Voting representatives can carry not more than 2 procurations in addition to their own vote.

In case a 2/3 majority cannot be obtained another vote has to be arranged for a later date with the aim of obtaining a 2/3 majority at that time. If this majority still cannot be obtained a further vote with a relative majority (abstentions not counted) will decide.

Elections will follow the subsequent procedure:

1. A candidate is elected in the first round if he or she obtains the absolute majority of the represented institutions. If no candidate obtains this absolute majority, those with the two highest numbers of votes will be retained for a second round.
2. In case of a second round, the candidate with the relative majority (abstentions not counted) is elected.

Re-elections, however, need a 2/3 majority.

The vote for elections and re-elections is secret and made by ballot.

The Collaboration Board can decide to terminate a person's assignment at any time and to request new elections.

The chairperson of the Collaboration Board is elected _ad personam_ by the Collaboration Board. The chairperson shall not represent any country, institution, or activity within ATLAS. The term of office is two years, and is not renewable. After the first year of office, a deputy is elected who will become the chairperson's successor. After the end of the chairperson's term of office, the chairperson will serve for yet another year as deputy.

The chairperson may nominate an advisory group, the members of which will be elected by the Collaboration Board upon proposal of the chairperson for the duration of the chairperson's term.

## 4 Spokesperson(s)

ATLAS will normally have one spokesperson. However, the Collaboration Board can also decide, with a 2/3 majority, to elect two spokespersons.

The spokesperson(s) are responsible to the Collaboration Board for the execution of the ATLAS project.

The spokesperson(s) are elected _ad personam_ by the Collaboration Board, after nomination of candidates by, and due consultation with, the Collaboration. The spokesperson(s) represent the Collaboration to the LHC Committee, to the CERN Management, and to the outside.

The term of office is three years, renewable with a 2/3 majority.

The spokesperson(s) may nominate one or two deputies, who will be elected by the Collaboration Board for the duration of the term of office of the spokesperson(s). The responsibilities of the deputy spokesperson(s) have to be clearly defined.

The spokesperson(s) and their deputies shall not represent any country, institution, or activity within ATLAS.

## 5 Executive Board

The Executive Board directs the execution of the ATLAS project, in line with policies set by the Collaboration Board. The Executive Board brings together the coordinators responsible for the design, construction, and operation of ATLAS within the available resources, with a view to the overall performance of the experiment.

Typical tasks will be:* review of schedules;
* setting and review of milestones;
* review of financial and human resources;
* coordination between the subdetector work programmes;
* coordination of test beam activities;
* coordination of hardware and software.

The detailed composition of the Executive Board will be adapted to the current needs of the experiment. Its composition, as well as the description of the specific tasks for the Executive Board members, are given in a separate document which is subject to approval by the Collaboration Board.

The Executive Board is chaired by the spokesperson(s). The technical coordinator serves as deputy chairperson.

The members of the Executive Board are elected for a period of office of two years, renewable with a 2/3 majority.

The technical coordinator will typically deal with

* integration issues of the subdetectors;
* safety;
* ATLAS infrastructure at CERN;
* surface and experimental areas, services;
* installation;
* machine interface;
* test beams.

The technical coordinator chairs regular technical coordination meetings.

The resource coordinator is a member of the Executive Board. He or she oversees the resource planning of the ATLAS project, and will typically deal with

* budget planning;
* manpower planning;* Memoranda of Understanding;
* Common Fund.
