Introduction

A big challenge for the electron identification at LHC is the suppression of the overwhelming QCD jet background. The ratio between the differential cross sections \(\frac{d\sigma}{dP_{T}}\) between jets and single isolated electrons is in the order of \(10^{5}\). In general, quarks and gluons fragment into several hadrons, leading to broad energy distributions in the calorimeter, which can easily be distinguished from the narrow clusters produced by electrons. However with a certain probability, which is in the order of \(10^{-3}\), a jet fragments into a single charged or neutral hadron which carries nearly the total jet energy. Whereas the neutral hadrons (mainly \(\pi^{0}\)'s) can only be further rejected by the central tracking system the calorimeter can still provide additional rejection power against charged hadrons (mainly \(\pi^{\pm}\)).

A detailed investigation and understanding of the e/\(\pi\) separation in the calorimeter is therefore needed, in particluar to specify the requirements of the central tracking system. If the combined rejection against QCD jets (resulting from fragmentation and e/\(\pi\) separation) is not enough to bring the fake electron rate to an acceptable level, additional rejection must and can only be obtained from additional particle identification in the tracking detector.

In the present note a study of the e/\(\pi\) separation problem under real LHC conditions is presented for a full liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeter with a fine longitudinal and transverse granularity. In Section 2 the details of the simulation are briefly described. The various variables used for the e/\(\pi\) separation are discussed in Section 3. These variables are then combined by using a statistical discriminant method. The method itself as well as the results obtained are presented in Section 4.

## 2 Description of the Simulation

### Geometry Setup

The description of the calorimeter geometry has been implemented in the SLUG/GEANT framework. In the same framework the version B of the central tracking system of ATLAS as presented in the Letter of Intent [1] is described. At central rapidity (\(\eta=0\).) the total amount of material in the tracking system corresponds to 0.25% of a radiation length (\(X_{0}\)). It is followed by the coil and the cryostat, for which in total a material corresponding to 1.0 \(X_{0}\) is assumed.

The electromagnetic calorimeter is assumed to be a lead LAr sampling calorimeter with a total thickness corresponding to 27 \(X_{0}\). In the longitudinal direction the calorimeter is subdivided into 7 compartments (EC1-EC7) of which the first four have a thickness corresponding to 1.2 \(X_{0}\) each, followed by two large compartments in the middle of the electromagnetic calorimeter and a last one (2.4 \(X_{0}\)) at the end of the calorimeter (see Fig.1). In the transverse direction a cell granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.02\times 0.02\) is assumed. The internal structure of the calorimeter is assumed to be the same as proposed for the TGT design [2]. The electromagnetic calorimeter is followed by a hadronic iron LAr sampling calorimeter with a transverse granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.02\times 0.02\). In the longitudinal direction a fine segmentation in steps of one interaction length (\(\lambda_{int}\)) is assumed. The only material considered between the two calorimeters is a plate of aluminium with a thickness of 2 cm.

### Simulated Data Samples

For the present study electron samples at energies of 12, 20, 40 and 100 GeV have been simulated. A simple cluster algorithm is used to reconstruct the electron energies. The algorithm maximizes the energy in a window of \(5\times 5\) cells, however only the energy in the core of \(3\times 3\) cells is used for the energy measurement. Only those clusters with an energy above 10 GeV are kept for the analysis. This is motivated by the requirement that electrons above this energy should be identified and measured under LHC conditions. The reconstructed energy distributions are shown in Fig.2. The tails on the low energy side are due to large bremsstrahlung losses in the central tracking detector.

Large samples of charged pions have been simulated with energies of 20, 40 and 100 GeV. The distribution of the total energy, given by a weighted sum of the electromagnetic and the hadronic energy, is shown for the 40 GeV sample in Fig.3a. Starting point for the e/\(\pi\) separation is however not the total but the corresponding electromagnetic energy as

Figure 2: _Reconstructed electron energy distributions_measured in a volume of \(3\times 3\) cells times 27 \(X_{0}\). Therefore the same cluster algorithm as decribed above has been applied to the electromagnetic energy deposits of the charged pions. The reconstructed electromagnetic cluster energies are shown for the 40 GeV pion sample in Fig.3b. The requirement of a minimal energy of 10 GeV leads already to a significant rejection of charged pions, especially at low pion energies. The corresponding rejection factors are shown in Fig.4 as a function of the pion energy.

### Pile-up Contributions

In order to take pile-up contributions into account, minimum bias events, generated with the PYTHIA Monte Carlo generator [3], have been superimposed onto the electron and pion energy depositions. A luminosity of 1.7 \(10^{34}\)\(cm^{-2}sec^{-1}\) and an integration time of 45

Figure 3: _Reconstructed energy distributions for 40 GeV pions; a) total energy, b) electromagnetic energy_

ns have been assumed, leading on average to a superposition of 46 events. Some relevant distributions, like the total amount of pile-up energy collected in \(20\times 20\) and \(3\times 3\) cells in the electromagnetic calorimeter and in \(20\times 20\) cells in the hadronic calorimeter, are shown in Fig.5 for central rapidity (\(\eta=0\).). The mean values of the energy contributions deposited in the various compartments are listed in Tab.1.

\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline compartment & \(X_{0}\) & mean energy (GeV) & mean energy (GeV) \\  & \(\lambda_{int}\) & 20 x 20 cells & 3 x 3 cells \\ \hline el. magn. total & 26.8 & 3.383 & 0.066 \\ \hline el. magn.

### Electronic Noise

Estimates of the electronic noise of an electromagnetic TGT calorimeter have been presented in Ref.[4]. Values based on these calculations are used in the present simulation. They are listed in Tab.2 for the individual readout channels (ROC) in each compartment. The total electronic noise in the electron volume of \(3\times 3\) cells times \(27X_{0}\) is estimated to \(\sim\)175 MeV.

For a hadronic liquid argon calorimeter the noise has been estimated to be at the level of \(\sim 2\) GeV for a volume of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi\times\Delta\lambda_{int}=0.3\times 0.3\times 4.0\)[5]. From this number the noise for the volume of the electron cluster can be calculated to be \(\sim 200\) MeV per interaction length for \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.06\times 0.06\). The distributions of the total noise (electronic noise + pile-up noise) are shown in Fig.6 for \(1\times 1\) and \(3\times 3\) cells in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter. In depth it has been integrated over 27 \(X_{0}\) (total electromagnetic) and \(3\lambda_{int}\). The resulting distributions have a Gaussian component from the electronic noise and tails resulting from large pile-up contributions.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|} \hline compartment & \(X_{0}\) & electronic noise \\  & & / ROC (MeV) \\ \hline el. magn. EC1 & 1.2 & 5.2 \\ el. magn. EC2 & 1.2 & 5.2 \\ el. magn. EC3 & 1.2 & 18.6 \\ el. magn. EC4 & 1.2 & 18.6 \\ el. magn. EC5 & 9.8 & 33.0 \\ el. magn. EC6 & 9.8 & 33.0 \\ el. magn.

### Procedure to extract the Rejection Factors

For all variables which will be used for the e/\(\pi\) separation the following procedure has been applied to extract the rejection factors against single pions as a function of energy. From the electron samples at the various energies cutoff values are defined for which 98% of the events are kept. It should be noted that the events in the radiative tail (outside of the Gaussian region) have been ignored for the determination of these cutoff values. As an example the cutoff values are shown in Fig.7 for the hadronic leakage energies together with an appropriate parametrization. This parametrization is then used to determine for each pion from its deposited electromagnetic energy in a 3 \(\times\) 3 matrix the energy dependent cutoff value. This guarantees that the pions with a certain electromagnetic energy deposition are directly compared to electrons of the corresponding energy.

Figure 7: _Hadronic leakage cutoff values as a function of energy for electron efficiencies of 97 and 98 %_Variables for e/\(\pi\) Separation

The straightforward way to identify electrons is to exploit the characteristic differences in the hadronic energy fraction, in the longitudinal and transverse shower shapes, as well as in fraction of the energy deposited in the first longitudinal segment, which can be considered as a preshower detector. The distributions of these quantities for electrons and pions will be compared in the following.

### Leakage into the Hadronic Calorimeter

A cut on the leakage in the hadron calorimeter represents a powerful tool to reject all those pions which start showering very late. However, using this variable is somewhat critical at LHC since it is sensitive to pile-up and electronic noise. This can be seen in Fig.8, where the energy deposited by 40 GeV electrons in the first three interaction lengths in the hadron calorimeter is shown for different areas of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi\).

The dominant Gaussian component from the electronic noise can be suppressed by applying a 3\(\sigma\)-cut; this is equivalent to ignoring all cells with an energy below \(\sim\)350 MeV. If this procedure is applied, the energy distributions shown in Fig.9 are obtained, which are quantitatively in agreement with the ones obtained if electronic noise is ignored. Non-zero energy contributions result mainly from large pile-up contributions; in addition there are a few outliers resulting from fluctuations in the electronic noise. If the same cut procedure is applied to the pion sample, the distributions shown in Fig.10 are obtained (note the large number of events in overflow). Especially for small \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi\) areas, also pion events are found which have zero leakage energy above the threshold and which are therefore indistinguishable from genuine electrons. Obviously the fraction of these events becomes smaller if the \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi\) summation area is increased. The presence of noise and pile-up calls therefore for an optimization of the size of the summation area in the hadronic calorimeter.

Figure 8: _Hadronic leakage energies for 40 GeV electrons, including pile-up and electronic noise_

Figure 10: _Hadronic leakage energies for 40 GeV pions after a 3\(\sigma\) cut, including pile-up and electronic noise_

Figure 9: _Hadronic leakage energies for 40 GeV electrons after a 3\(\sigma\) cut, including pile-up and electronic noise_

In Fig.11 the obtained rejection factors against 40 GeV pions are shown for a constant electron efficiency of 98% as a function of the area. Four different scenarios are compared: curve a) represents the situation where pile-up and electronic noise are not considered. The rejection is increasing with increasing size of the area. For curve b) pile-up energies are included. In this case a shallow maximum is found for an area around \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=\)0.30 \(\times\) 0.30. For curve c) both pile-up and electronic noise are included and no noise suppression cut is applied. Compared to situation b) the rejection drops by more than a factor of two. Most of this can however be gained back by applying the 3\(\sigma\)-cut (curve d). In the last case the largest values for the rejections are found for a small area corresponding to \(9\times 9\) cells; however the dependence on the size of the area is found to be rather weak.

The individual rejection factors of the hadronic leakage cut are shown in Fig.12 as a function of the pion energy for a veto area of \(9\times 9\) cells. As expected, the rejection is increasing with increasing pion energy due to the better separation between the leakage energies from electrons and pions. The rejection is found to vary between \(\sim 2.5\) at 20 GeV and 85 at 100 GeV.

An interesting question is to what extend the cut on the hadronic leakage can be replaced by a cut on the energy deposited in the last electromagnetic compartment (2.4 \(X_{0}\) at the back of the electromagnetic calorimeter). Such a procedure might be necessary if due to large amounts of material between the electromagnetic and the hadronic calorimeter small leakage energies cannot be measured reliably in the hadronic calorimeter (case of a so called "ATLAS hybrid solution"). The results for the pion rejection by using the compartment EC7 are shown as well in Fig.12. The answer to the question raised above depends on the energy of the pions. For low pion energies the last electromagnetic compartment can take

Figure 11: _Combined rejection factors (had. leakage + cluster requirement) against pions of 40 GeV as a function of the veto area in the hadronic calorimeter_

the role of a "veto counter" and a comparable rejection is achieved. Due to the larger overlap between the electron and pion signal in this last electromagnetic compartment the rejection obtained is however smaller for pions with high energies. However a definite conclusion can only be drawn after the leakage cut has been combined with the other cuts in the game (see Sect. 4.6).

### Transverse Shower Shape

A second important variable for the discrimination between electrons and pions is the transverse shower shape. For electrons the transverse energy distribution is narrow and most of the energy is already contained in in \(3\times 3\) cell matrix corresponding to an area of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.06\times 0.06\). This is confirmed by the distributions shown in Fig.13a, where the ratio between the energies measured in \(5\times 5\) cells over the energy measured in \(3\times 3\) cells is shown for 40 GeV electrons, with and without (shaded histogram) pile-up contributions. Due to the relatively small area these contributions can be kept well under control and lead only to a small broadening of the distribution. The discriminative power of this variable is illustrated in Fig.13b, where the distribution for 40 GeV electrons is compared to the one obtained for 40 GeV pions (shaded histogram).

For the determination of the rejection factors against charged pions, upper values for the energy ratio are fixed in such a way, that the efficiency for keeping electrons is 98%. The rejection found against charged pions is shown in Fig.14 as a function of the pion energy. After this cut on the transverse shower shape is applied only very little can still be gained from other variables exploiting the transverse energy distribution. Cuts on the transverse shower radius, energy ratios between larger cell matrices or cuts on the energy distribution in the core of the electron cluster (four leading cells) are highly correlated to the \(\mathrm{E}(5\times 5)/\mathrm{E}(3\times 3)\) cut and do not lead to a significant increase of the rejection.

Figure 12: _Rejection factors against charged pions for different had. leakage cuts._

An interesting question, which can also be addressed here is the question by how much the \(e/\pi\) separation would be degraded, if the requirements on the transverse granularity of the calorimeter were relaxed. A first evaluation can be done by using the energy ratio \(\mathrm{E}(7\times 7)/\mathrm{E}(5\times 5)\) instead of \(\mathrm{E}(5\times 5)/\mathrm{E}(3\times 3)\) for the \(e/\pi\) separation. This would correspond to a situation where the granularity is increased from \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.02\times 0.02\) to \(0.03\times 0.03\) and still \(3\times 3\) cells are used for the energy measurement of electrons. The distribution of the energy ratio is shown in Fig.15 again for electrons and pions of 40 GeV. The effects of the larger pile-up contributions are visible and they lead to a worse separation between electrons and pions. The results obtained for the pion rejection are represented by the dotted line in Fig.14. Compared to the previous situation the rejection is decreased by a factor which varies between 1.5 and 2.0 over the energy range considered.

### Energy in the First Electromagnetic Layer

Another important role in the e/\(\pi\) separation is taken by the first compartment in the electromagnetic calorimeter. It can be used to measure the early onset of the shower. This function can also be decoupled from the calorimeter and can be taken by an independent preshower detector. Figure 16a shows the energy fraction deposited in the first compartment by 40 GeV electrons both with and without the additional pile-up contributions. Due to the small thickness of the first compartment the effect of the additional pile-up energy is only very small. As can be seen from Fig.16b, pions deposit in general a much smaller fraction of their electromagnetic energy in this first layer (shaded histogram). Only in the case of early interactions (in the calorimeter or in the material in front) their energy deposition is well above that from a minimum ionizing particle.

Applying again the procedure as described above, of fixing cutoff values such that electrons are kept with an efficiency of 98% independently of their energy, leads to the rejection factors against pions as shown in Fig.17. The rejection factors are found to be in the order of 2.5, relatively independet of the pion energy. If the preshower cut is combined with the previous cuts (leakage, transverse shower shape) the additional rejection is found to be at \(\sim\)1.7 for 40 GeV pions.

For the design of the layout of the longitudinal structure of the calorimeter it is important to study whether the rejection depends on the thickness of this 'preshower' detector.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:19]

### Longitudinal Shower Shape

In addition to the first layer also the other longitudinal compartments contain useful information for the e/\(\pi\) separation. The energy fractions observed in the various layers are shown for 40 GeV electrons and pions (shaded histograms) in Fig.18. It should be noted that the various distributions are strongly correlated. These correlations are removed in Fig.19 where the same distributions are shown after a cut has been applied on the energy depostion in the first layer. From these distributions it is clear, that discriminative power is still contained in the energy information of layers two, five and six. The energies deposited in the layers three and four are strongly correlated to the energy deposited in layer two. Layer two is particularly important, since in conjunction with layer one it contains information about the slope of the early shower. This is confirmed by the distributions shown in Fig.20, where the ratios of energies deposited in consecutive layers are shown. As expected, significant differences between electrons and pions are found in the energy ratio of the first two compartments as well as in the ratio between the two big blocks in the middle of the calorimeter.

Applying cuts on the ratios EC2/EC1, EC3/EC2 and EC6/EC5 leads to the rejection factors shown in Fig.21. The rejection is found to be in the order of 4-5 and it is found to be only slowly varying with the pion energy.

Statistical Discriminant Analysis

An important question is how the information contained in the different variables can be combined in an optimal way to achieve the best \(\mathrm{e}/\pi\) separation. A simple concatenation of one-dimensional cuts is probably not satisfactory, since the correlation between the variables have to be taken into account in a proper way. A solution to the problem is provided by statistical discriminant methods [6] of which the Fisher algorithm will be described in the following and will be applied to the problem of \(\mathrm{e}/\pi\) separation.

### Fisher's Discriminant Function

Given is the problem that an individual observation of \(n\) variables, which can be represented by a vector \(\vec{x}\), must be assigned to one of the two populations, denoted by \(P_{1}\) and \(P_{2}\). Fisher has suggested to use a linear combination of the observables

\[y=\vec{\lambda}\ \ \vec{x}\]

and to choose the coefficients \(\vec{\lambda}\) so that the ratio of the difference of the means of the linear combination in the two groups to its variance is maximized [7]. If the mean value of the observations in the two groups are given by \(\vec{\mu_{1}}\) and \(\vec{\mu_{2}}\) and the covariance matrix is given by C, this corresponds to maximizing the function

\[\Phi(\vec{\lambda}) = \frac{(\vec{\lambda}\ \vec{\mu_{1}}-\vec{\lambda}\ \vec{\mu_{2}})^{2}}{\vec{\lambda}^{4}\ C\ \vec{\lambda}}\]

Differentiating \(\Phi\) with respect to \(\vec{\lambda}\) and requiring \(d\Phi/d\lambda=0\) leads to:

\[\vec{\lambda} \sim C^{-1}(\vec{\mu_{1}}-\vec{\mu_{2}})\]

Since \(\vec{\lambda}\) will be used only to separate the two populations, the proportionality factor is not important and \(\vec{\lambda}\) can be multiplied by any constant.

This method has a few attractive features:

* a \(n\)-dimensional problem is reduced to a one-dimensional one; the only variable left in the game is the y-variable.
* all n observables can be used at the same time; the method assigns weights to the individual observables, which are proportional to their separation power. This implies both that the signifcant observables can be extracted and the non-significant ones can be discarded to reduce the dimensionality of the problem.
* the correlations between the variables are taken into account.
* no training or tuning is required

However, also a warning has to be expressed. The method is known to work well if the individual distributions of the variables are Gaussian and if the covariance matrices between the variables in the two populations are not too different. It can be shown, that for the case of Gaussian distributions and identical covariance matrices the method cannot be outranged.

### Application to the Problem of e/\(\pi\) Separation

For the e/\(\pi\) separation problem one must be particularly concerned about the last statement. A priori some of the most distinctive distributions, like for example the hadronic leakage energy and the energy deposited in the first layer, have non-Gaussian shapes. The problem can however be overcome, if a priori cuts are introduced and the Fisher algorithm is applied to the remaining event samples. If one asks for example that

* \(E_{had}\)\(<2.0\) GeV (max. hadronic leakage energy)
* \(EC1/E(3\times 3)>0.150\) GeV (min. energy in the first layer)

the bulk of the pion events is rejected. The remaining events show electron like shape and are hard to reject by simple one-dimensional cuts. Due to the fact that their energy distributions are similar to the ones of the electrons also the covariance matrices of the remaining pions and of the electrons are similar. The distributions of some variables for the remaining pions and for electrons of 40 GeV are shown in Figs.22 and 23. The pion events are always represented by the shaded entries.

Figure 22: _Distribution of transverse shower shape variables and energy isolation; electrons and remaining pion events (shaded entries) of 40 GeV_Figure 23: _Distribution of longitudinal shower shape variables; electrons and remaining pion events (shaded entries) of 40 GeV_

It should be noted, that by applying the two cuts listed above, electrons of 40 GeV are kept with an efficiency of about 97% and pions of 40 GeV are rejected by a factor of \(\sim\)50. The Fisher algorithm is applied to the remaining event samples by using the following variables:

\begin{tabular}{l l} hadronic leakage (after cut): & \(E_{had}(9\mathrm{x}9)\) \\ transverse shower shape: & E\((5\times 5)\) / E\((3\times 3)\) \\  & E\((7\times 7)\) / E\((3\times 3)\) \\  & cluster radius \\ preshower energy: & EC1/E(3x3) \\ longitudinal shower shape: & EC2 / EC1 \\  & EC3 / EC2 \\  & EC4 / EC3 \\  & EC5 / EC4 \\  & EC6 / EC5 \\ energy isolation: & E\((9\times 9)\) - E\((5\times 5)\) \\ \end{tabular}

After the algorithm is applied the \(y\)-distributions presented in Fig.24 are obtained for the events in the two populations. Despite the similarities in the individual variables a respectable difference in the combined variable \(y\) is found. The weighting factors assigned to the individual varibles are listed in Tab.4.

A few remarks need to be made:

* the weights for the hadronic leakage and the preshower energy are small, since cuts have been applied to these variables beforehand and the remaining distributions show no significant difference.
* Most of the discriminative power is contained in the transverse variables, of which the ratio between the energy measured in the \(5\times 5\) and \(3\times 3\) matrix is found to be the most important one.
* the transverse energy sharing is found to be more important for the \(\mathrm{e}/\pi\) separation than the longitudinal one.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l l|c|} \hline variable & & separation power \\ \hline \hline hadronic leakage (after cut): & \(E_{had}\)(9x9) & 0.08 \\ \hline transverse shower shape: & E(\(5\times 5\)) / E(\(3\times 3\)) & 1.85 \\  & E(\(7\times 7\)) / E(\(3\times 3\)) & 0.28 \\  & cluster radius & 0.16 \\ \hline preshower energy: & EC1 / E(3x3) & 0.02 \\ \hline longitudinal shower shape: & EC2 / EC1 & 0.18 \\  & EC3 / EC2 & 0.13 \\  & EC4 / EC3 & 0.06 \\  & EC5 / EC4 & 0.05 \\  & EC6 / EC5 & 0.18 \\ \hline energy isolation & E(\(9\times 9\)) - E(\(5\times 5\)) & 0.30 \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

### Results

The results on e/\(\pi\) separation are presented in Fig.25, where the rejection factors against charged pions are shown as a function of the pion energy for different electron efficiencies. Electronic noise and pile-up noise are included as described previously. As expected, the e/\(\pi\) separation power increases with increasing energy. For an electron efficiency of 90% it is found to vary between \(\sim\)80 at 20 GeV and \(\sim\)1300 at 100 GeV.

It should be noted, that the rejection factors obtained in the discriminant analysis are for the same electron efficiency about 30% higher than the ones obtained by applying a concatenation of one-dimensional cuts.

### Characteristics of the Remaining Events

The distribution of the electromagnetic energies of the remaining, not rejected pion events are shown in Fig.26. Most of them have electromagnetic \(3\times 3\) energies close to the incident pion energy. There exists however a tail in which events are found which have only a relatively low electromagnetic \(3\times 3\) energy. A detailed investigation has shown, that in these events the electromagnetic core is accompanied by a halo of soft charged hadrons, which spreads out in a large volume around the core of the cluster. In addition they show only very little energy in the hadron calorimeter. If the electromagnetic energy is summed over a large area of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\varphi=0.4\times 0.4\), the original pion beam energy is obtained.

There is an elegant way to reject those events by combining the calorimeter information with the information of the central tracking detector. One has to require that the energy measured in the core of the cluster (\(3\times 3\) matrix) is consistent with the momentum measured in the tracking detector (p/E matching). Such a cut will be applied in any case in the global electron identification and therefore no additional loss of efficiency has to be taken into account.

### Results after p/E Matching

Applying the p/E constraint leads to a significant improvement of the e/\(\pi\) separation, especially at low energies. The results obtained for the pion rejection are presented in Fig.27 for an electron efficiency of 90%. In the energy range considered it is found to vary between \(\sim\)200 at 20 GeV and \(\sim\)1300 at 100 GeV.

### Dependence on the Hadronic Leakage Cut

A study of the dependence of the global rejection factors on the hadronic leakage cut has been performed. As already mentioned earlier, detector scenarios can be imagined, in which one cannot rely on a measurement of small energies behind the electromagnetic cluster in a hadronic calorimeter. The e/\(\pi\) separation has been studied for four different scenarios:

* hadronic leakage cut used in the standard way as described above
* no hadronic leakage cut applied at all
* leakage cut of 10 GeV applied; in this case small energy deposits are ignored, however events with leakage energies above 10 GeV are rejected
* the energy measured in the last electromagnetic compartment EC7 is used instead of the hadronic energy

The results for the pion rejection are presented in Tab.5. If no leakage cut is applied at all, the pion rejection drops by a factor ranging between 1.2 at 20 GeV and 1.8 at 100 GeV. Part of this can be recovered if events with more than 10 GeV behind the electromagnetic cluster are rejected. In this case the loss of rejection is also at the high energies at the level of 20%. At low energies, where this cut is obviously not effective, rejection power can be gained back by using the energy deposited in the last electromagnetic layer.

To conclude: If the hadronic calorimeter cannot be used to measure small energy deposits behind the electromagnetic cluster, the loss in pion rejection power can be kept below 20% over the total energy range considered, provided it is possible to detect large hadronic energy deposits (E \(>\) 10 GeV) and to have access to the energy deposited in the last few radiation lengths of the electromagnetic calorimeter.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline pion energy & pion rejection & pion rejection & pion rejection & pion rejection \\  & standard cut & no had. cut & 10 GeV cut & EC7 cut \\ \hline
20 GeV & 81. \(\pm\) 10. & 65. & 65. & 70. \\
40 GeV & 215. \(\pm\) 32. & 165. & 174. & 180. \\
100 GeV & 1330. \(\pm\) 205. & 741. & 1110. & 805. \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Table 5: Pion rejection as a function of energy for different types of leakage cutsSummary

A Monte Carlo study of the e/\(\pi\) separation under LHC conditions in the energy range between 20 and 100 GeV has been performed. For an electron efficiency around 90 % pion rejection factors between 200 and 1300 can be achieved. At high energies the rejection of pions is straigthforward and from a combination of the various shower shape variables the large rejection factors can be easily obtained. In order to achieve the rejection quoted above at low energies, it is however necessary to require in addition to the calorimetric selection the p/E constraint. This constraint is essential in order to reject pion showers, which are characterized by an electromagnetic core surrounded by a halo of soft hadrons, which cannot be distiguished from hadrons from minimum bias pile-up.

The present study has shown, that the hadronic leakage, the energy in the first electromagnetic layer, and the transverse energy sharing are the essential variables for the e/\(\pi\) separation. In addition, a fine longitudinal segmentation improves the separation power, since information on the slope of the early shower development is available. If the hadronic calorimeter cannot be used to measure small energy deposits behind the electromagnetic cluster, a fine segment at the back of the electromagnetic calorimeter can take over the role of the hadronic compartments and the loss of rejection power can be partially recovered.

Concerning the global electron identification at LHC, the combined rejection from the calorimeter and from the p/E constraint seems to be adequat to bring the background from jets faking electrons at the same level or even below the level of genuine isolated electrons. This rejection seems to be sufficient for most of the physics processes of interest at LHC and no additional particle identification in the central tracking detector is needed. It may however be essential for a clean measurement of an inclusive electron spectrum down to low values of transverse momentum.

Finally one should keep in mind, that the present study relies heavily on the detailed simulations of electromagnetic and hadronic showers in the calorimeter and that it is especially sensitive to the tails of the distributions. Therefore, in addition to the quoted statistical errors, the estimated rejection factors could have large systematic uncertainties.
