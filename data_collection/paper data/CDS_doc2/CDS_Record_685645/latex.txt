In the present ATLAS baseline design [1] the Accordion electromagnetic calorimeter is preceeded, both in the Barrel and in the End Cap region, by a fine grain LAr preshower detector [2] installed inside the same cryostat.

The first beam tests with small scale prototypes have demonstrated that this configuration, which has been proposed and developped by the RD3 Collaboration, provides accurate measurements of the energy and direction of electrons and photons and allows for particle identification (mainly \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation with contribution also to the charged hadron rejection) at the level required at the LHC [3, 4, 5]. A "2m" calorimeter prototype with part of a medium scale preshower are presently being tested with beam.

The solution recently adopted by the GEM experiment [6] at the SSC is an interesting alternative to a preshower detector: in this approach it is the first compartment of the electromagnetic calorimeter that, thanks to a fine \(\eta\)-segmentation in strips a few mm wide, acts also as preshower.

Given the obvious advantage of this design, where two detectors are combined in one with potential benefits on the cost, on the mechanics etc., we have investigated whether a calorimeter "a la GEM" in the ATLAS detector can satisfy the main physics requirements of a dedicated preshower.

This note reports the results of this study. Section 1 describes the GEM electromagnetic calorimeter while the main features of our simulation are given in Section 2. Section 3 to 5 discuss the physics performance of a calorimeter a la GEM: energy measurement, \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation capability, angular resolution. Finally Section 6 and 7 are devoted to future work and to the conclusions.

All the results will be presented in a comparative way with the performance of the RD3 preshower and calorimeter as obtained both from simulation and from test beam data.

## 1 The GEM electromagnetic calorimeter

The GEM electromagnetic calorimeter (Fig. 1, [6]) is a lead-liquid krypton sandwich with Accordion shaped absorber and readout electrodes and is installed at about 1m from the interaction centre.

It is segmented longitudinally in three compartments. The last two samplings have a standard calorimetric granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.027\times 0.027\), while in the first sampling the \(\eta\) granularity is six times better, the readout electrodes being segmented in strips of pitch 4.7mm. Since the GEM detector has no preshower, the role of this finely segmented first compartment is to provide adequate \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation. To keep the number of channels of the first sampling as in the second and third segment, in the other view (\(\phi\)) each strip covers six standard calorimeter cells and extends over 17cm in azimuth.

Another important task of the preshower, the recovery of the energy lost by electrons and photons in the dead material upstream of the calorimeter, is achieved in this case by means of the so called "massless gap" (see Section 3.1): in the first 3.5cm of the calorimeter the lead of the converter plates is replaced with light material (G10), thus giving rise to a region consisting almost only of active medium. This region is read out together with the first sampling.

This solution, which is well suited to the Accordion mechanics where the kapton readout boards extend in \(\eta\) and therefore can be in principle segmented in this direction as finely as wished, provides, at essentially fixed cost since the number of channels is kept constant, a calorimeter which is also a preshower. However it has to be demonstrated that the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection needed in ATLAS can be achieved with only one granular view (\(\eta\)) and that the presence of long strips in the other direction (\(\phi\)) does not seriously deteriorate the energy reconstruction and the electron identification. For instance, a simulation of this calorimeter done by the GEM Collaboration gave a \(\pi^{0}\) rejection of less than 3 for \(p_{T}>40\) GeV (Fig. 15),which is not at the level required in ATLAS where a rejection of \(\geq 3\) is wished over the whole range relevant for the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) search (25\(<p_{T}<\)75 GeV) [7]. Therefore one of the aims of this work was to understand whether with a "modified" calorimeter a la GEM, with better (but still reasonable) granularity and adequate thickness of the first sampling, a \(\pi^{0}\) rejection of \(\geq\)3 can be achieved.

## 2 The simulation

To study the performance of a calorimeter a la GEM in the ATLAS detector the following sets of events were generated:

* \(\gamma\)'s and \(\pi^{0}\)'s at \(\eta\)=0 with \(p_{T}=25,50,75\) GeV and at \(\eta\)=2.1 with \(p_{T}\)=50 GeV to study the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection in the Barrel and in the End Cap over the interesting \(p_{T}\) range for the \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) search. The \(\gamma\) samples were also used to determine the angular resolution of the calorimeter.

electrons of 10 and 50 GeV at \(\eta\)=0 and \(\eta\)=1 to study the energy resolution and in particular the energy recovery with a massless gap.

Particles were generated at \(z=0\) with a vertex spread of 5.6cm, as expected at the LHC, and at the calorimeter front face covered a spot of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.025\times 0.1\) around the nominal direction of generation.

For this first study no inner detector and no magnetic field were simulated and the inner cavity was filled with air up to the cryostat. Cryostat and coil were described with the standard ATLAS datacards as in [7]. In particular in the Barrel region they extended over 22cm starting at a radius of 115cm.

The preshower and the extra (tapered) material were removed and the calorimeter placed just behind the cryostat inner wall after 4cm of inactive LAr needed for the front-end electronics and for cables. The resulting distance of the calorimeter from the interaction centre was 140cm (366cm) at \(\eta\)=0 (\(\eta\)=2.1) and the amount of dead material in front of it about 1.3 \(X_{0}\).

### Calorimeter a la GEM

The electromagnetic calorimeter was simulated with the correct absorber and gap thickness as in the Accordion but with flat plates. This is not an extreme simplification because we were interested to study the detector behaviour in \(\eta\) while the Accordion structure is in \(\phi\).

The calorimeter had a total depth of about 26 \(X_{0}\) and at the front face started with 2cm of massless gap optimized as described in Section 3.1

The generation granularity was 1mm in \(\eta\) and 3.5cm (0.025) in \(\phi\) and the cells were fully pointing toward the interaction centre. Hits were recorded every radiation length to allow a study of the detector performance as a function of the thickness of the three samplings.

In the analysis \(\eta\) strips were grouped in the second sampling to obtain the standard granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.025\times 0.025\) (Fig 2). In the third sampling the segmentation in \(\eta\) should be two times coarser [7]; however in this simulation we halved the granularity in \(\phi\) instead of \(\eta\), which is more appropriate in this calorimeter for reasons that will become clear in Section 5.

In the first compartment different \(\eta\) granularities, typically between 1mm and 6mm, were studied. In order to keep the number of channels of this first sampling at an acceptable level, in the other direction (\(\phi\)) four standard calorimeter cells were grouped together in the same readout channel (\(\Delta\phi\)=0.1, Fig. 2). The choice of a coarser azimuthal segmentation than in the GEM calorimeter, where \(\Delta\phi=6\times 0.027=0.16\), was motivated by two reasons. Previous studies [4] demonstrated that with preshower strips longer than about 10cm in one of the two directions the photon identification would suffer the contribution of the pile-up noise. Furthermore the latter would seriously deteriorate also the energy resolution of low \(p_{T}\) electrons (\(\leq\)20 GeV), in particular in the End Cap region and for particles hitting near the \(\phi\) boundary between two strips, as discussed in Section 3.2.

### ATLAS preshower and calorimeter

The performance of a calorimeter a la GEM was studied in parallel with the ATLAS calorimeter and preshower, which were simulated as in [7].

The calorimeter had a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.025\times 0.025\), both in the Barrel and in the End Cap 1, and was longitudinally segmented in three compartments of thickness \(3\times 8X_{0}\).

The Barrel preshower consisted of 2 \(X_{0}\) of passive material (in part provided by the cryostat-coil system, in part by some tapered lead) followed by 1cm of active LAr, by another 1 \(X_{0}\) of lead and by a second 1cm thick LAr layer. The two active regions were divided in pointing strips (non tilted) of granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.1\times 0.002(0.002\times 0.1)\) in the first (second) layer.

In the End Cap, for reasons that will be explained in Section 4.2, the passive material was concentrated in only one block of 3.6 \(X_{0}\) (at \(\eta\)=2.1) located in front of two 1cm thick LAr layers. The granularity of the finer view (\(\phi\) in the first layer, \(\eta\) in the second one) was varied between 0.002 (1.8mm at \(\eta\)=2.1) and 0.004 (3.6mm at \(\eta\)=2.1), while in the coarser view the segmentation was 0.1.

### Electronic noise

In the first sampling of a calorimeter a la GEM, the readout electronics would be the same as in the rest of the calorimeter [8], that is either GaAs/Si cold preamplifiers or the warm "0T" scheme, the latter being the best candidate for the End Cap region. This because this first compartment would be thicker than a separate preshower detector (as we will see in Section 4), therefore would contain a larger part of the shower and therefore need a calorimeter electronics, more demanding in terms for instance of dynamic range. Furthermore, due to the larger density of channels in this first sampling (see Section 4), the power dissipated by the preamplifiers should be at least a factor of two smaller than in the other two segments of the calorimeter, that is \(\leq\)20 mW.

The electronic noise used in the simulation to smear the energy content of each cell was obtained from the values measured in various beam tests of Accordion prototypes or in the laboratory, suitably scaled for the capacitance of the calorimeter cell. For the channels of the first sampling this value was increased by 20% to take into account the effect of the above mentioned reduction in dissipated power.

The resulting figures are

\(\sim\) 18 MeV/strip\(\simeq\) 0.2 mip 1st sampling

\(\sim\) 80 MeV/cell 2nd sampling

\(\sim\) 90 MeV/cell 3rd sampling

The first case is for a typical granularity of 3mm in \(\eta\) and 0.1 in \(\phi\) and for a 6 \(X_{0}\) thick first compartment, which results in a cell capacitance of about 150 pF, i.e. about 25% of a standard Accordion cell.

For the ATLAS calorimeter a noise of 70 MeV/cell, 70 MeV/cell and 90 MeV/cell in the three compartments respectively was extrapolated from test beam measurements, while for the preshower we used the value of 0.2 mip/strip expected from the various electronic schemes presently under development [2].

### Pile-up

Since the pile-up effects on the detector performance are in principle not negligible in a high luminosity environment such as the LHC, some effort was devoted to perform a detailed and "realistic" simulation.

Due to the small dimensions of the preshower or calorimeter strips, the correlation between adjacent channels is important and it is not correct to simply use some kind of parametrization of the pile-up energy distribution to smear the physics signal in a given cell.

Therefore minimum bias events were generated with Phythia 5.5 tuned as in [9]. All particles were then traced in a full simulation of the ATLAS apparatus (the inner detector and the magnetic field were included in this case) and electrons and photons were showered in the calorimeter and in the preshower down to an energy of 100 KeV.

An inelastic cross section of 80 mb was assumed. However, since the average charged particle multiplicity per unit of pseudorapidity given by Phythia is too low [10] (4 particles, while an extrapolation of CDF data to \(\sqrt{s}=16\) TeV would give about 6.4), the cross section was multiplied by a factor 1.6 to compensate for this difference.

The number of soft collisions per bunch crossing was decided according to a Poisson distribution with a mean value of

\[<N_{MB}>=L\sigma T\]

which, for a luminosity \(L=1.7\times 10^{34}\)cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and a bunch spacing \(T=15\) ns, gives an average of 33 events per crossing.

The events belonging to a same bunch crossing were then summed and suitably weighted by using a parametrization of the detector (preshower or calorimeter) signal at the output of the bipolar shaper (Fig. 3). The latter has a lenght related to the drift time \(t_{drift}\) of the ionization electrons in the LAr (400 ns for the 2mm gap of the calorimeter and 200 ns for the 1mm gap of the preshower) and a peaking time (\(t_{p}\)) of the response to the detector triangular signal of 40ns in the calorimeter and 75ns (40ns) in the Barrel (End Cap) preshower. In any case results obtained with a given signal waveform \(w(t)\) can be simply extended to a different pulse shape by applying the Campbell's theorem

\[\frac{\sigma^{2}(w_{1})}{\sigma^{2}(w_{2})}=\frac{\int w_{1}^{2}(t)dt}{\int w_ {2}^{2}(t)dt}\]

in which \(\sigma^{2}\) is the pile-up variance.

The final "pile-up" event consisted in average of \(N_{MB}\cdot t_{drift}/T\simeq\)900 soft interactions 2 and was added cell by cell to the generated \(\gamma\) or \(\pi^{0}\) event.

Footnote 2: For a given luminosity this number is indipendent of the bunch spacing.

An example of pile-up energy deposited in a cell of granularity \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.002\times 0.1\) in the first sampling of a calorimeter a la GEM is shown in Fig. 4, while Table 1 summarizes the

## 3 Energy measurement

In this section we discuss some effects which can potentially deteriorate the energy measurement in a calorimeter a la GEM with respect to the ATLAS preshower and calorimeter: the energy lost in the dead material upstream of the calorimeter, the higher contribution of the pile-up noise due to the long strips in the first sampling, the effect of the dead space between adjacent strips, the variation of the energy response as a function of the particle impact point across the Accordion waves.

### Energy recovery

The inactive material in front of the Accordion, which varies from about 1 \(X_{0}\) at \(\eta\)=0 to 2.5 \(X_{0}\) at the two ends of the Barrel and is mainly due to the cryostat and coil, deteriorates the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter. In the ATLAS detector this deterioration can be avoided by measuring the signal released by electrons and photons in the two active layers of the preshower, as demonstrated by test beam results (see Fig.9 in [3]).

Without a dedicated preshower detector, as in the GEM experiment, the energy lost upstream of the calorimeter can still be recovered by placing a layer of only active medium without absorber, therefore called "massless gap", in the first part of the calorimeter just behind the cryostat wall: in fact the energy deposited in this active region is strongly correlated to the energy lost in the immediately preceeding dead material.

* A mass gap can be easily integrated in the Accordion mechanics by simply replacing the first few centimetres of lead in the absorber plates with lighter material (like plastics or G10). Furthermore its thickness is independent of the rapidity because the actual depth traversed by particles at non normal incidence scales in the same way as the upstream dead material.

The appropriate massless gap thickness can be determined by optimizing the energy resolution for electrons and photons. Since the fraction of the particle energy lost in the upstream dead material is higher at low energy, 10 GeV electrons generated at two rapidities (\(\eta\)=0, \(\eta\) = 1) were used for this study. In each compartment of the calorimeter the energy was reconstructed in a cluster of \(3\times 3\) cells around the tower with the highest signal and the massless gap was assumed to be read together with the first sampling. The electronic and pile-up noise were not included in the simulation for this study.

The resulting energy resolution as a function of the mass:'s gap thickness is shown in Fig. 5. At \(\eta\)=1, where there are about 2 \(X_{0}\) of dead material in f:.t of the calorimeter, the positive effect of the massless gap is clearly visible: the resolution improves from about \(13.4\%/\sqrt{E}\) with no massless gap to \(11\%/\sqrt{E}\) at the optimal massless gap thickness (2cm). At \(\eta\)=0, where the dead material is only 1 \(X_{0}\), the trend is less pronounced but still a minimum is visible around 2cm. A similar result was obtained at 50 G:\(\sqrt{}\).

Fig. 6 shows the energy spectra reconstructed in the calorimeter for 10 GeV electrons at \(\eta\)=1 in three different cases. The resolution of 3.2% in the ideal case of no cryostat in front of the calorimeter deteriorates to 4.2% whit a realistic cryostat and no massless gap and is recovered to 3.5% when a 2cm massless gap is inserted (the errors on this numbers are negligible). Therefore the sampling term of the energy resolution increases by 10%. However, since at 10 GeV the electronic and pile-up noise contribution is as high as the sampling term (i.e. about 3%) the overall deterioration of the resolution is negligible.

The study described in this section is only a first estimate of the effect of a massless gap. Further work is needed to determine for instance its dependence on the shower energy.

### Pile-up and electronic noise contribution

In the Accordion calorimeter an electromagnetic shower is usually reconstructed in a region of 3\(\times\)3 towers. The electronic and pile-up noise levels in this area are given in Table 2.

In the first sampling of a calorimeter a la GEM, where the strips extend over four conventional cells in \(\phi\), an area corresponding to 3\(\times\)4 standard cells in \(\eta\times\phi\) would be needed for particles hitting the central part of a strip (indicated as case A in Table 2), and a region two times larger for showers near the strip boundary in \(\phi\) (case B).

It can be seen that the electronic noise, which scales as the square root of the number of channels, is similar for the two detectors (for the calorimeter a la GEM a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi=0.002\times 0.1\) has been used).

Concerning the pile-up, in case A it is essentially unchanged, because the cluster size is only slightly larger than the standard nonet, while in case B it is higher by about 60%. This translates in a deterioration of the overall energy resolution by about 8% (25%) for \(p_{T}\)=10 GeV at \(\eta\)=0 (\(\eta\)=2.1). However these numbers are somewhat pessimistic because the better segmentation in \(\eta\) would probably allow to reduce the cluster size in this direction.

### Effect of the dead regions between strips

The Accordion segmentation in \(\eta\) is achieved by etching cells of the wished size on the readout kapton circuits. In the prototypes built so far adjacent cells are separated by 1mm of dead space.

Although it would be technically possible to reduce this inactive region to 0.5mm, in a calorimeter a la GEM, in which the cell size in the first sampling is decreased from a few centimetres to a few millimetres, this dead space becomes a relevent part of the acceptance.

For this preliminary study the dead regions were not included in the simulation. However we could estimate at the first order the effect of a 0.5mm wide inactive space between adjacent strips by giving half weight to the energy in one "generation" strip (1mm wide) out of the three or four grouped together in the same readout strip.

The results showed that, after weighting the energy in the first compartment of the calorimeter by a factor corresponding to the ratio of the total to the active area, the sampling term of the energy resolution increases by (6\(\pm\)2)%.

This effect, which should be further studied with a simulation including also the electric field map, can probably be reduced by slightly tilting the strips from their pointing direction toward the interaction centre. In fact we have checked that for electrons generated with no vertex spread the deterioration of the sampling term is a factor of two higher.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|r|r|r|} \hline Setup & Electronic noise & Pile–up rms & Pile–up rms \\  & & (\(\eta\) = 0) & (\(\eta\) = 2.1) \\ \hline ATLAS calorimeter (\(3\times 3\)) & 370 & 160 & 570 \\ \hline Calorimeter a la GEM (case A) & 340 & 170 & 630 \\ (case B) & 360 & 250 & 1000 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: **Estimated pile–up and electronic noise contribution to an electromagnetic cluster (MeV)**We also observed that if the dead space is increased to 1mm the worsening of the resolution, even after suitable energy weighting, becomes unacceptably high (35%).

### Correction of the Accordion modulation

It is known that the Accordion geometry induces a modulation of the energy response as a function of the particle impact point in \(\phi\)[8]. This modulation, which has an amplitude contained within \(\pm 1\%\), can easily be corrected for, so that the calorimeter constant term can be locally kept as low as 0.2% also with a geometry fully pointing toward the interaction centre [11]. The response correction as a function of the particle position is done by using the shower barycentre provided by the calorimeter itself, namely the centre of gravity reconstructed in the first sampling which allows for the highest space accuracy.

In a calorimeter a la GEM, due to the coarse \(\phi\) granularity of the first compartment, one would use the shower position in the second sampling for the energy correction. The effect of this was estimated by looking at the test beam data collected with the "2m" prototype. At the highest energy point (300 GeV), where the contribution to the resolution from the constant term is higher and therefore the correction of the modulation more critical, no change of the electron energy resolution was observed within errors when using the barycentre in the second sampling rather than in the first one.

## 4 \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation

The rejection of energetic \(\pi^{0}\)'s faking single photons would be the main task of a dedicated preshower detector at the LHC. The most demanding physics channel in this respect is a possible \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay in the mass range 80-140 GeV: to keep the residual jet-jet and \(\gamma\)-jet background to this channel safely below the irreducible QCD \(\gamma\gamma\) background, a \(\pi^{0}\) rejection of at least 3 is needed in the range \(25\!<\!p_{T}<75\) GeV after all the cuts in the calorimeter [7].

In this section we discuss the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation capability of the first sampling of a calorimeter a la GEM and how this sampling has been optimized, in terms of granularity and thickness, to achieve the best performance with an acceptable number of channels.

Examples of shower profiles in \(\eta\) for 50 GeV photons and \(\pi^{0}\)'s at :0 are shown in Fig. 7 and 8 respectively. In this case the granularity is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq\)0.002(\(\sim\)3mm)\(\times\)0.1 and the thickness of the first calorimeter sampling 6 \(X_{0}\). The total signal has a broad distribution with mean 60 mip (1mip\(\simeq\)100 MeV) and the average shower width is 1.7mm for \(\gamma\)'s and 2.8mm for \(\pi^{0}\)'s. At this energy and rapidity the minimum radial distance between the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay is 7.5mm.

To distinguish single from double photons a few simple shape variables were used in the \(\eta\) view of the first compartment:

* the shower "profile" defined as: \[\rho_{\eta}=\frac{E_{1}+E_{2}}{\Sigma_{i}E_{i}}\]

\(E_{1}\) is the energy in the most energetic strip of the first compartment, \(E_{2}\) the energy in the nearby strip with more signal and the sum is performed over \(\pm n\) strips around the most energetic one, where \(n\) spans a region of about 2cm, i.e. half a standard calorimeter cell. Fig. 9 shows the variable profile for 50 GeV photons and \(\pi^{0}\)'s at \(\eta\)=0: the narrow photon showers, which are essentially contained in 2-3 strips (see Fig. 7), have higher values of \(\rho_{0}\) than the overlapping photons from a \(\pi^{0}\) decay.
* the shower width defined as the second order momentum of the energy distribution: \[w_{\eta}=\left(\frac{\Sigma_{i}(x_{i}-\overline{x})^{2}E_{i}}{\Sigma_{i}E_{i}} \right)^{1/2}\] where \(\overline{x}\) is the shower barycentre in \(\eta\), \(x_{i}\) and \(E_{i}\) the position and energy of the \(i\)-th strip and the sum is done over all strips, on the left and right side of the most energetic one, down to a strip energy of \(E_{stop}\)=0.1\(\cdot\)\(E_{1}\). The distribution of this variable for photons and \(\pi^{0}\)'s is shown in Fig. 10.
* the shower isolation: a second cluster, defined as a local maximum plus the two adjacent strips, is looked for in a region of about 4cm and its energy (Fig. 11) required to be typically less than 3 mip.

The set of cuts was optimized after adding the pile-up.

### \(\pi^{0}\) rejection in the Barrel

The \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation power of the two options was studied, in the Barrel, only at \(\eta\)=0. In principle the results obtained in this case should not vary at different rapidities within the Barrel region because at fixed \(p_{T}\) the smaller angle between the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay is exactly compensated by the larger distance of the calorimeter from the interaction centre. However the increase of the traversed dead material in front of the calorimeter for non normal incidence could broaden the photon shower and therefore deteriorate the identification. This point is still to be studied.

#### 4.1.1 Rejection versus thickness of the first sampling

Fig. 12 shows the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection at 50 GeV and \(\eta\)=0 as a function of the thickness of the first sampling of a calorimeter a la GEM. These results were obtained with a combination of cuts on the shape variables described in the previous section and correspond to an efficiency of 90% on single photons. The granularity in this case is \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.002\times 0.1\), that is the same strip size as in the two views of the ATLAS preshower.

The rejection improves with increasing thickness of the first compartment because the showers of the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay are more developped and therefore better recognized. A plateau is reached at about 6 \(X_{0}\): here the rejection is about 3.3, i.e. at the level required in ATLAS.

Also shown in Fig. 12 is the rejection obtained with the ATLAS preshower and calorimeter. Shape variables similar to those described in the previous section were used in the preshower, this time in both views. Furthermore in this case it is possible to exploit also the calorimeter information in combination with the preshower and looking at the matching of the shower positions in the two detectors: this variable is particularly useful to reject those events in which one of the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay did not convert in the preshower, or produced a small signal, because in this case the shower barycentre in the preshower, which is that of the converted photon, will not in general match the barycentre in the calorimeter, which is instead due to both photons (Fig. 13). This method, which can only be used in the \(\phi\) view where the position of the interaction vertex will be known with a precision of a few tens of \(\mu m\), improves by typically 30% the rejection which would be obtained with only a shape analysis in the preshower and cannot of course be used in a calorimeter a la GEM due to the lack of \(\phi\) granularity in the first sampling. The rejection of about 2.8 given by our simulation for the ATLAS case is about 15% lower than the result obtained with the test beam data [3]; this is due in part to the effect of the pile-up noise and in part to the better granularity (\(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\simeq 0.019\times 0.019\)) of the calorimeter prototype built for the test which enhanced the effect of the \(\phi\)-match method described above.

With regard to pile-up it is interesting to notice 'that it does not affect the rejection in a calorimeter a la GEM because in the plateau region the first sampling is thick enough that the showers are well developped and give large signals. For this same reason, however, the effect of the vertex spread is quite important because a photon non directional with the pointing strip axis will in general cross more than one strip and therefore produce a broader shower; the resulting loss in \(\pi^{0}\) rejection for fixed 90% photon efficiency is about 10%. The opposite occurs in the ATLAS preshower because the active layers are thin (1cm of LAr) and because they see the very beginning of the shower.

It could be surprising that, for a given granularity, a detector with only one fine view can work at the level, or even better, than a detector with two views. A few considerations are needed on this point. Fig. 12 shows that for the same detector thickness (3 \(X_{0}\)) the ATLAS preshower, with two views, gives a 40% better rejection than a calorimeter a la GEM. It can also be seen that the amount of material is quite critical because it affects both, the development of the two showers from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay and the signal fluctuations. 50 GeV photons release in average 6 GeV in the first 6 \(X_{0}\) of a calorimeter a la GEM and only 0.5 (1.5) GeV in the first (second) layer of the ATLAS preshower. On the other hand it is not possible to add one more radiation length in front of the preshower, which would improve the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection by 30%, because the energy resolution would start deteriorating at low energy as indicated by test beam results [3]. Moreover in a calorimeter a la GEM the absorber is finely sampled with active LAr at a frequency typical of a calorimeter with advantage in the reduction of the shower fluctuations, while in the ATLAS preshower the 3 \(X_{0}\) of passive material are sandwiched only with two active layers.

In conclusion the first compartment of a calorimeter with strips in ATLAS should have a thickness of 6 \(X_{0}\): this is the best compromise between adequate \(\pi^{0}\) rejection and the need of keeping the region with essentially no \(\phi\) granularity as thin as possible.

#### 4.1.2 Rejection versus granularity

After fixing the thickness of the first calorimeter compartment at 6 \(X_{0}\) we looked to the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation as a function of the \(\eta\) granularity. In \(\phi\) the granularity was fixed at \(\Delta\phi\)=0.1, which gives a strip length of 14cm: a coarser segmentation would deteriorate the detector performance as explained in Section 2.1 and 3.2.

Fig. 14 shows that the rejection deteriorates slowly with decreasing \(\eta\) granularity and remains acceptable up to \(\Delta\eta\)=4mm (0.0028). It can also be seen that in the first compartment of the Barrel calorimeter 2-3 times more channels than in the present design would be needed, that is at most 90000 more channels instead of the 200000 of a separate preshower detector (the latter however would be probably equipped with cheaper electronics).

In Fig. 14 is also plotted the point corresponding to a granularity \(\Delta\eta=0.0045\) (6mm), which is the segmentation chosen for the GEM calorimeter. As anticipated in Section 1 this granularity does not provide the needed rejection. The latter decreases by about 15% when the thickness of the first sampling is reduced from 6 \(X_{0}\) to 3 \(X_{0}\) as in the GEM calorimeter. As a cross-checkthis result is compared in Fig. 15 to the results of a simulation of the GEM calorimeter from reference [6]: these numbers include also the contribution to the rejection from an analysis of the shower shape in the second and third sampling of the calorimeter. We estimated this contribution to be small at 50 GeV (20%) and included it in our point.

#### 4.1.3 Rejection versus \(p_{T}\)

Good \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation is required down to about 25 GeV since in the search for a possible \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) signal this would probably be the \(p_{T}\) cut on the softest photon [7].

Fig. 16 shows the rejection as a function of \(p_{T}\) for the two "preshower" options considered here. For the calorimeter a la GEM a granularity of 3mm and a first sampling thickness of 6 \(X_{0}\) were assumed. As expected the rejection get worse with increasing \(p_{T}\) because the minimum radial distance between the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay decreases from 15mm at 25 GeV to 5mm at 75 GeV. However the improvement at low \(p_{T}\) is quite modest because the shower signal is small and therefore the fluctuations are higher especially in the relatively thin standard preshower. It can be seen that an optimized calorimeter a la GEM provides the needed rejection over the whole interesting \(p_{T}\) range, while the result obtained with the ATLAS preshower and calorimeter is slightly worse. However in Section 4.3 it will be shown that when more sophisticated methods, like a neural network, are used, the rejection is similar for the two options and well above 3.

When comparing Fig. 16 to Fig. 15 a different trend as a function of \(p_{T}\) is observed. If at 50 GeV the rejection with the calorimeter optimized in this simulation is clearly higher than with tre granularity and thickness of the GEM calorimeter, at low \(p_{T}\) the opposite occurs. This is due to the fact that, as mentioned above, in the GEM simulation also the second and third sampling of the calorimeter are used and at low energy, where the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay are at a distance of 1cm or more, the improvement is large especially thanks to the use of the \(\phi\) view. This further contribution to the rejection was not considered in this simulation because in principle it should not be included in the needed factor of 3 as explained at the beginning of Section 4.

#### 4.1.4 Further remarks

The effect of the dead space between strips on the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) discrimination with a calorimeter a la GEM was estimated with the method described in Section 3.3. Also in this case this effect is negligible, within the errors, if the separation region is 0.5mm wide, while with 1mm the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection decreases by 10% for a fixed photon efficiency of 90%.

In the first sampling of a calorimeter a la GEM the core of a photon shower is contained in typically three \(\eta\) strips (Fig. 7) and in most cases in only one strip in \(\phi\). Therefore in the analysis described above we have always used only one \(\phi\) strip, the most energetic one, when building the shape variables for the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation.

However since the generated spot extended over a calorimeter region of \(\Delta\phi\)=0.1, that is fully covered one \(\phi\) strip, one could think that for events hitting near the \(\phi\) boundary between adjacent strips, two strips in \(\phi\) should be considered. This would allow also to reject those configurations in which the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay hits two nearby \(\phi\) strips. However it was found that the \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation is not improved when a larger cluster in \(\phi\) is used because the increase in the number of rejected \(\pi^{0}\)'s is somewhat compensated by the reduced photon efficiency due to the higher contribution of the pile-up.

In conclusion the simulation shows that a cluster consisting of only one \(\phi\) strip is fully adequate for all kinematic configurations.

### \(\pi^{0}\) rejection in the End Cap

The \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation in the End Cap was studied at \(\eta\)=2.1 and for \(p_{T}\)=50 GeV. At this rapidity and transverse momentum the particle energy is about 200 GeV, the average shower size 1mm (it was 1.7mm at \(\eta\)=0 for the same \(p_{T}\)) and the minimum distance of the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay is 4.5mm at the calorimeter front face (it was 7.5mm at \(\eta\)=0 for the same \(p_{T}\)).

Fig. 17 shows the \(\pi^{0}\) rejection as a function of the strip granularity for the two options. The thickness of the first sampling of the calorimeter a la GEM was fixed at 6 \(X_{0}\) since a study similar to the one described for the Barrel showed that also in the End Cap this is the depth at which a plateau in the rejection is reached. It can be seen that for this detector the rejection in the End Cap is the same as in the Barrel for the same granularity, i.e. about 3. This is not surprising because already when commenting Fig. 16 it was pointed out that the rejection deteriorates slowly with energy, that is with decreasing separation of the two photons, because the smaller distance is compensated by the narrower shower size and by its higher energy. In particular the two photons from 75 GeV \(\pi^{0}\)'s produced at \(\eta\)=0 have the same separation at the calorimeter front face as those from 200 GeV \(\pi^{0}\)'s generated at \(\eta\)=0 and actually they are rejected at the same level for the same granularity.

The needed rejection of 3 is achieved with a strip size of 3mm in \(\eta\). With this granularity and with a segmentation of \(\Delta\phi\)=0.1 (strip lenght of \(\sim\) 9cm) over the region \(1.4<|\eta|<2.3\) the number of channels in the first sampling of the End Cap would be doubled with respect to the present calorimeter design, i.e. about 21000 more channels would be needed in total for the two End Cap. This has to be compared with the 80000 channels in the standard ATLAS End Cap preshower for approximately the same granularity and coverage.

Fig. 17 shows also that, unlike in a detector a la GEM, the performance of the ATLAS preshower and calorimeter is much better in the End Cap than in the Barrel, since a rejection of more than four is achieved for a 3mm strip size. This can be attributed to the fact that, as explained in Section 4.1.1, this setup was somewhat penalized by the small amount of material and the low shower signal in the active part of the preshower. In the End Cap at \(\eta\)=2.1 the particle energy is four times higher for the same \(p_{T}\). Furthermore with put more passive material (3.6 \(X_{0}\)) in front of both views (see Section 2.2) since at these energies there is no problem of degradation of the resolution. In these conditions the advantage of a detector with two useful views is clearly visible. Even larger is the rejection achieved with this setup for \(p_{T}\)=25 GeV (particle energy 100 GeV) thanks to a minimum distance of 1cm between the two photons from the \(\pi^{0}\) decay.

### \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation with a neural network

Artificial neural networks :NN) have already been applied to the problem discriminating between photons and neutral pions, for instance by ALEPH [12] with the :romagnet : calorimeter, and more recently by the RD33 Collaboration, which used the information from layers of strips located inside the TGT calorimeter [13].

A neural network has also been used in this study with a twofold aim: on the one side we wanted to explore the potential of the ANN technique with respect to the conventional analysis described in the previous sections; on the other side, an ANN allows to compare in an automatic and optimized way the performance of the two different "preshower" options.

## 5 Angular resolution

An accurate determination of the photon direction will be extremely important at the LHC: in particular in the search for a possible \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay an angular resolution of better than 100mrad/\(\sqrt{E}\) will be needed for a precise measurement of the Higgs mass [7].

Since the \(z\) position of the interaction vertex will not be known with enough precision, in the ATLAS baseline detector the determination of the photon direction in \(\eta\) will rely upon the information from the calorimeter and the preshower. Test beam results have shown that an angular resolution of better than 7 mrad above 40 GeV can be achieved by combining a calorimeter and a preshower measurement of the shower barycentre [3].

In a calorimeter a la GEM the first sampling with strips reconstructs the shower position in \(\eta\) with high accuracy (\(\sim\)200 \(\mu\)m at 50 GeV). The second point can be provided either by the second sampling, or by the third one, or by the two together.

To determine the angular resolution of this detector the photon samples generated around \(\eta\)=0 at 25, 50 and 75 GeV were used. The thickness of the first compartment was fixed at 6 \(X_{0}\) as explained in Section 4 and a granularity of \(\Delta\eta\times\Delta\phi\)=0.002(\(\simeq\)3mm)\(\times\)0.1 was chosen. The elctronic and pile-up noise were included in the simulation as described in Section 2.3 and 2.4

In the first compartment the shower barycentre was reconstructed by using three \(\eta\) strips (the most energetic one and its two neighbours): this small region allows for the best space resolution since it includes only the shower core and is therefore less subjected to the fluctuations in the tails. In the second sampling a cluster of \(3\times 3\) cells was used. In the third compartment, where for good angular measurement the \(\eta\) segmentation was kept at 0.025 as in the second sampling, the \(\phi\) granularity is twice coarser: therefore a region of \(3\times 2\) cells in \(\eta\times\phi\) was chosen to reduce the noise effect.

Fig. 20 shows the angular resolution for 50 GeV photons as a function of the thickness of the second compartment (the noise was suitably scaled) and for different combinations of the positions measured in the three segments. It can be seen that the accuracy of the measurement obtained by using the first and the third sampling, which is a priori favoured by to the long lever arm, deteriorates rapidly with increasing thickness of the second compartment due to the decrease of the amount of energy deposited in the last section and to the high electronic noise. On the other hand the first and second sampling give a resolution which improves with the thickness of the second compartment and reaches a plateau of about 10 mrad when essentially all the shower energy is contained in the first two segments. Finally the resolution obtained by using the first segment and the rest of the calorimeter does not depend on the position of the frontier between the second and third sampling as expected. Similar trends were observed at 25 and 75 GeV.

A few conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, the resolution of 10 mrad achieved at 50 GeV is well below the limit of 100 mrad/\(\sqrt{E}\) mentioned at the beginning of this section. Second, the measurement of the photon direction does not put any constraint on the thickness of the second/third sampling of the calorimeter, which can therefore be determined on the basis of other physics requirements such as for instance the \(e/\pi\) separation. Third the angular resolution of a calorimeter a la GEM is worse than the resolution obtained with the RD3 preshower and calorimeter 3, as shown by Fig. 20. The difference can be in large part explained by the longer lever arm (15cm compared to 11cm) available in the second case where two separate detectors are used.

Footnote 3: The test beam results were suitably scaled to take into account the difference in granularity between the ATLAS calorimeter and the RD3 prototype.

Similar comments apply to the other energy points (Fig. 21).

A final remark. The angular resolution obtained by the GEM Collaboration from a simulation of their detector is about 39 mrad/\(\sqrt{E}\)[6], which is at the level of the resolution provided by the RD3 preshower and calorimeter. This result is better than in our simulation because due to both the use of liquid krypton and the slower shaping time, the electronic noise in the calorimeter is about four times smaller than in the ATLAS Accordion. Therefore the angular measurement can be done with the first and third sampling, which provides a lever arm of more than 20cm.

## 6 Open questions

The results discussed in the previous sections show that a calorimeter a la GEM can provide a \(\pi^{0}\) rejection and angular resolution at the level needed at the LHC: these features are particularly useful in the search for a \(H\rightarrow\gamma\gamma\) decay. There are however other physics requirements and channels for which such a detector could be disfavoured with respect to the ATLAS baseline preshower and calorimeter:

* Electron reconstruction. The electromagnetic cluster in the calorimeter is the starting point for the electron reconstruction in ATLAS because it defines roads in which the charged track is looked for in the inner detector. In particular an accurate measurement of the shower position in \(\phi\) is needed in case of radiating electrons to determine the point in which the Bremsstrahlung photon was emitted. As already pointed out, in a calorimeter a la GEM only the second compartment can be used for the reconstruction of the shower barycentre in \(\phi\) and therefore the space resolution in this direction is worse than in the standard Accordion. At 50 GeV the deterioration was evaluated to be at the level of 15%.
* \(e/\pi\) separation. The rejection of charged hadrons can be deteriorated in a calorimeter a la GEM for two reasons. First adequate granularity is needed in the electromagnetic calorimeter to recognize the usually broader showers produced by \(\pi^{\pm}\). The coarse \(\phi\) segmentation of the first sampling of a calorimeter with strips will not certainly help in this respect. Furthermore a useful tool in the \(e/\pi\) discrimination is the different signal produced by these particles in traversing a small amount of material, as in a dedicated preshower detector. For instance the probability that 10 GeV electrons give a signal larger than 3 mip in the first (second) layer of the RD3 preshower is 98% (100%) [3]. Test beam data show that, after a set of calorimetric cuts, the preshower provides an additional charged hadron rejection of about 2 in the energy range 20 to 60 GeV [5].
* Electron identification. The coarse \(\phi\) granularity of the first sampling could reduce the rejection of the jet background (\(\pi^{0}\) overlapped to a charged track, etc.) and deteriorate the efficiency of the electron identification, for instance for electrons close to jets (B-physics). On the other hand the very fine \(\eta\) granularity in the first sampling can enhance both the background rejection and the electron efficiency.
* Energy resolution.

The results discussed in Section 3 indicate that the accuracy of the energy measurement in a calorimeter a la GEM can be kept at an acceptable level. However these results require confirmation from a more detailed simulation of the detector including for instance the Accordion structure, the dead spaces, the description of the electric field and the charge collection mechanism.

All these points are presently under study.

## 7 Conclusions

The potential of a LAr electromagnetic calorimeter with \(\eta\) strips in the first sampling, possible alternative to a dedicated preshower detector, has been studied within ATLAS.

The simulation, which included the main known effects as the contribution of the electronic and pile-up noise as well as the vertex spread, demonstrated that important requirements such as good energy and angular measurement and \(\gamma/\pi^{0}\) separation capability are satisfied at the level required for operation at the LHC.

This study also pointed out that the first sampling of the calorimeter should have a thickness of 6 \(X_{0}\) and an \(\eta\) granularity of 3-4mm in the Barrel and 3mm in the End Cap. This would increase the total number of channels by 60000-70000 units (Barrel and End Cap together) with respect to the standard Accordion, but the absence of a separate preshower with its 260000 channels would clearly simplify the overall detector layout. Finally the separation region between adjacent strips in \(\eta\) should not exceed 0.5mm.

Work is presently going on to determine the cost of this solution and to further investigate the implications on the physics, especially with respect to the electron identification. If also these studies will produce positive results, we think that this option would deserve a test with beam.
