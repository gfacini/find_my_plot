**Abstract**

A set of cuts is proposed for the \(D_{s}{\rightarrow}\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\pi\) trigger at the Event Filter level derived from offline analysis. The rate obtained with this set of cuts varies between 0.26% and 0.41% of the \(pp\rightarrow\mu(p_{T}>6\ {\rm GeV},\ |\eta|<2.4)X\) rate at low luminosity, depending on the actual values of the cuts. Further rate reduction is possible by increasing the muon \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold. The effect of changing the muon \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold on the number of signal events is also evaluated.

Introduction

In this note an estimation of the rate at the Event Filter (EF) level for the \(D_{s}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\pi\) channel is presented.

A muon trigger with a transverse momentum, \(p_{\rm T}\), threshold of 6 GeV and pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.4\) initiates the \(B\)-selection at the level-1 trigger (LVL1). The muon is confirmed at the level-2 trigger (LVL2) using information from Muon Spectrometer and Inner Detector (ID). The nominal output rate (referred to as \(\mu 6X\) rate) from this LVL2 RoI-guided muon trigger is 9 kHz [1] for a luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) (referred to as 'low luminosity'). Newer studies [2] suggest, however, that a significant discrimination between prompt muons from \(b\) decays and those from \(\pi/K\) meson decays can be achieved. This would reduce the trigger rate from \(\pi/K\) decays by a factor of 3, resulting in a \(\mu 6X\) rate of 5 kHz at the LVL2 trigger.

At the LVL2 trigger, specific channels of interest are selected (\(e.g.\), \(B^{0}_{d}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\), \(J/\psi\)\(\rightarrow\)\(e^{+}e^{-}\), \(D_{s}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\pi\)). The LVL2 trigger uses dedicated online algorithms to reconstruct tracks in the ID. Details about the LVL2 selection can be found in Ref. [3].

At the EF level, a further decrease of the rate is obtained by introducing additional cuts similar to those used in the offline analysis or derived from them. It is expected that the reconstruction of the tracks at the EF level will be based on offline algorithms. Earlier studies [4] gave a \(D_{s}\) trigger rate of 0.45% of the \(\mu 6X\) rate. However, those studies introduced some cuts which are not used offline and are dependent on the \(B^{0}_{s}\) momentum spectrum.

## 2 Data sample

This analysis uses a sample of 9073 \(\bar{b}b\rightarrow\mu 6X\) events1 with pile-up at low luminosity. The analysis program is derived from the offline \(B^{0}_{s}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(D^{-}_{s}\)\(\pi^{+}\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(D^{-}_{s}\)\(a^{+}_{1}\) reconstruction program used for \(B^{0}_{s}\) oscillation studies [1].

The event sample was generated using the ATGENB package based on PYTHIA 5.7, passed through the ATLAS simulation program DICE (ID only) and reconstructed using an algorithm based on the Kalman filter implemented in the xKalman package from the ATLAS reconstruction program ATRECON.

## 3 Event Filter cuts

In Table 1, possible EF cuts and the percentage of reconstructed \(D_{s}\) events which remain after applying the relevant cut, are given. For comparison, the corresponding offline cuts are also shown.

Tracks with \(p_{\rm T}>0.5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) are selected. Pairs of oppositely-charged tracks with \(p_{\rm T}>1.5\) GeV and kaon mass assigned are used to reconstruct the \(\phi\) meson. Those pairs with invariant mass satisfying \(|M_{KK}-M_{\phi}|<14\) MeV (\(\approx 4\,\sigma_{\phi}^{\rm offline}\)) are selected as \(\phi\) candidates. Applying the kinematic cuts \(\Delta\theta_{KK}<20^{\circ}\) and \(\Delta\varphi_{KK}<20^{\circ}\) on the angles between the two tracks is not effective in combination with the \(\phi\) mass cut, therefore they are not included in the proposed set of cuts (see Section 4). A third track out of the remaining ones with \(p_{\rm T}>1.5\) GeV and pion mass assigned is added to the \(\phi\) candidate. Track combinations with invariant mass satisfying \(|M_{KK\pi}-M_{D_{s}}|\;<\;56\) MeV (\(\approx 4\,\sigma_{D_{s}}^{\rm offline}\)) are selected as \(D_{s}\) candidates. These cuts are similar to those applied at LVL2 trigger [3].

Further cuts not used in the LVL2 trigger are then imposed. The probability of the two-track vertex fit for \(\phi\) and three-track vertex fit for \(D_{s}\) should be greater than 0.5%. The transverse distance between the decay point of \(\phi\) and the primary vertex, \(d_{xy}^{\phi}\), and the similar one for \(D_{s}\), \(d_{xy}^{D_{s}}\), is required to be greater than 200 \(\mu\)m. Offline no direct cut on the transverse distance is imposed, but the corresponding one for \(B_{s}^{0}\) can be calculated from the proper time cut and the cut on the reconstructed transverse momentum:

\[t_{B_{s}}=\frac{M_{B_{s}}}{cp_{T}}\,d_{xy}^{B_{s}}\;>\;0.4\;{\rm ps}\quad{\rm and }\quad p_{T}>10\;{\rm GeV}\quad\Rightarrow\quad d_{xy}^{B_{s}}>223.3\;\mu{\rm m}\]

For \(B_{s}\) with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV, the \(D_{s}\) travels, in the laboratory system, forward with respect to the primary vertex, therefore one can use the derived \(d_{xy}\) cut for \(D_{s}\) and \(\phi\).

These cuts reduce the rate to 0.41% of the \(\mu 6X\) rate. If one tightens the \(\phi\) and \(D_{s}\) mass cuts to \(3\,\sigma^{\rm offline}\), the rate becomes 0.26% of the \(\mu 6X\) rate.

## 4 Proposed set of EF cuts

Based on the results from Section 3, the following set of cuts is proposed for the \(D_{s}\) selection at the EF level:

* Track quality cuts: \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\), \(\;p_{T}^{\rm track}>1.5\) GeV
* \(\phi\) vertex fit quality: probability \(>0.5\%\) (\(\chi^{2}/{\rm ndf}\approx 8/1\))
* \(\phi\) mass cut: \(|M_{KK}-M_{\phi}|<10\) MeV
* \(\phi\) transverse distance cut: \(d_{xy}^{\phi}>200\;\mu\)m
* \(D_{s}\) vertex fit quality: probability \(>0.5\%\) (\(\chi^{2}/{\rm ndf}\approx 13/3\))
* \(D_{s}\) mass cuts: \(|M_{KK\pi}-M_{D_{s}}|<43\) MeV
* \(D_{s}\) transverse distance cut: \(d_{xy}^{D_{s}}>200\;\mu\)m

These cuts select 0.26% of the \(\mu 6X\) events, giving a \(D_{s}\) EF rate of 24 Hz for a \(\mu 6X\) rate of 9 kHz, or 13 Hz for 5 kHz. The _EF-offline efficiency_ is 100%, because this set of EF cuts is a loose subset of the offline cuts.

The following comments are relevant to the results of this note:

* The results are based on offline code and perfect detector calibration and alignment. Different algorithms and resolutions at EF level could change the rates and reduce the efficiency of the selection.
* The Physics TDR geometry is used. If subsequent changes degrade the detector performance, the efficiency gained using the quoted values for the cuts will be lower or, if the mass cuts are kept at 3 \(\sigma\) of the new mass distributions, the rate will increase.
* The absolute numbers are functions of \(B\)-physics cross-sections.

## 5 Effect of increasing the muon \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold

Table 2 shows the effect of increasing the muon \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold on the \(D_{s}\) EF rate obtained with the proposed set of cuts from Section 4. The EF rate is given for both values of the LVL2 RoI-guided muon trigger rate (9 kHz and 5 kHz).

In Table 3 the numbers of reconstructed \(B^{0}_{s}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(B^{0}_{s}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) events are given for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), corresponding to one year of running at low luminosity. More details on the \(B^{0}_{s}\) reconstruction can be found in Ref. [1]. The signal efficiency given in the table is defined as the ratio between the number of \(B^{0}_{s}\) events expected to be reconstructed after all cuts in the offline analysis to the number of produced \(B^{0}_{s}\) events with \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) greater than the muon \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold and \(|\eta|<2.5\). The number of \(B^{0}_{s}\) events expected to be reconstructed is already corrected for the muon reconstruction efficiency and the LVL2 efficiency.

Fig. 1 shows the reduction of the \(D_{s}\) EF rate and of the number of reconstructed signal events as a function of the muon \(p_{\rm T}\) threshold; 100% corresponds to \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) = 6 GeV.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \(p_{T}^{\mu}\) & Percentage & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Rate [Hz]} \\ \([\)GeV\(]\) & \([\%]\) & 9 kHz & 5 kHz \\ \hline
6.0 & 0.26 & 23.4 & 13.0 \\
6.5 & 0.25 & 22.5 & 12.5 \\
7.0 & 0.23 & 20.7 & 11.5 \\
8.0 & 0.18 & 16.2 & 9.0 \\
9.0 & 0.14 & 12.6 & 7.0 \\
10.0 & 0.13 & 11.7 & 6.5 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

Raising the threshold from 6 GeV to 10 GeV decreases the \(D_{s}\) EF rate by a factor of two, whereas the number of reconstructed signal events drops to one third of the original number, degrading the physics potential.

## 6 Conclusions

A new set of EF cuts for the \(D_{s}\) trigger is proposed. The obtained rate is 0.26% of the initial \(\mu 6X\) rate, leading to a \(D_{s}\) EF rate of 24 Hz for a LVL2 RoI-guided muon trigger rate of 9 kHz (13 Hz for 5 kHz). The increase of the \(p_{T}\) threshold for the trigger muon degrades the ATLAS potential for the measurement of \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations. To reduce the \(D_{s}\) EF rate it is therefore preferable to tighten the \(D_{s}\) and \(\phi\) mass cuts to \(3\,\sigma\) as proposed in this note instead of keeping the mass cuts at \(4\,\sigma\) and increasing the muon \(p_{T}\) threshold.
