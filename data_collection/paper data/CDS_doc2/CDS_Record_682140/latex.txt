### Impact parameter resolution

The choice of the three different impact parameter resolutions used in this note was preceded by a period of studies of the performance of the precision layers of the new ATLAS inner detector. In particular the influence of the resolutions of these layers and of the position of the innermost one was studied. Figure 1 shows the dependence of the asymptotic impact parameter resolution, obtained for high \(p_{\perp}\) tracks, on the radius of the innermost tracking layer. This was simulated for a precision tracker consisting of five layers, with the resolutions shown in Table 1.

The dependence of the resolution on the radius of the innermost layer is quite steep, and it is therefore important to position this layer as close as possible to the interaction point. The resolution of this first \(R\varphi\) measurement is also very important. The overall impact parameter resolution also depends on the presence of the outermost layer, since the accuracy of the angular measurement also matters.

As can be seen in fig. 1, for a 10 cm radius innermost layer. one could reach 27 \(\mu\)m impact parameter resolution, with somewhat conservative assumptions on the resolution per point (20 \(\mu\)m). By taking a better value (which is however still realistic, as the experience from existing LEP experiments shows), namely 10 \(\mu\)m, one could reach 14 \(\mu\)m impact parameter resolution. If we are forced to go to \(R\) = 20 cm with the first measured point on the track, then an impact parameter resolution of the order of 50 \(\mu\)m should still be easy to obtain. Probably no impact parameter based \(b\)-tagging can be done for radii of the innermost layer larger than 30 cm (e.g. at very high luminosities).

The observations listed above lead to the choice of the three impact parameter resolutions used in the following:

\(\bullet\) an 'optimistic' asymptotic resolution of 14 \(\mu\)m, corresponding to a 10 \(\mu\)m precision point at a radius of 10 cm;

\(\bullet\) a'standard' asymptotic resolution of 27 \(\mu\)m, corresponding to a 20 \(\mu\)m precision point at a radius of 10 cm, which agrees with that used in previous studies [1];

\(\bullet\) a 'pessimistic' asymptotic resolution of 49 \(\mu\)m, corresponding to a 20 \(\mu\)m precision point at a radius of 20 cm.

For transverse momenta below \(\sim\) 10 GeV, multiple scattering significantly affects the impact parameter resolution, \(\sigma_{ip}\), which can be parametrized as follows:

\[\sigma_{ip}^{2}=A^{2}+\left(\frac{B}{P_{\perp}}\right)^{2},\]

where \(B\) represents the multiple scattering contribution. This component depends on \(\eta\) (or the polar angle \(\theta\)). For the cylindrical barrel layers the properparametrization is \(B_{\varepsilon}/\sqrt{\sin\theta}\), while for the larger rapidity disks, it is \(B_{\delta}/\sqrt{\cos\theta}\). We assume here that the transition from cylinders to disks takes place at \(|\eta|\) = 1.5. The following parametrization is therefore finally used, for the impact parameter resolution:

\[\sigma_{ip}^{2}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}A_{\varepsilon}^{2}+\left(\frac{B_{ \varepsilon}}{P_{\perp}}\right)^{2}\frac{1}{\sin\theta}&\mbox{ if }|\eta|<1.5\\ A_{\delta}^{2}+\left(\frac{B_{\delta}}{P_{\perp}}\right)^{2}\frac{1}{\cos \theta}&\mbox{ if }1.5<|\eta|<2.5\end{array}\right.\]

It is assumed rather arbitrarily, in the absence of a final and fully optimised design, that the average radius of the first measurement in the disk geometry (\(|\eta|>1.5\)) is 5 cm larger than in the cylindrical geometry. This leads to a difference between \(A_{\varepsilon}\) and \(A_{\delta}\) as well as between \(B_{\varepsilon}\) and \(B_{\delta}\). The full set of parameters used is shown in Table 2.

The multiple scattering term is the same for the 'optimistic' and'standard' resolutions, because they correspond to the same radial position of the first layer (\(R\) = 10 cm). The dependence of all three impact parameter resolutions on momentum, for tracks at \(\eta\) = 0, is shown in fig. 2. As expected, multiple scattering dominates the impact parameter resolution for \(p_{\perp}\) < 10 GeV. The amount of material (in radiation lengths) assumed was 0.3% for the beam pipe and, more importantly, 1% for each of the first two layers. The other layers correspond to 2% each, but the amount of material, as well as it's position, are less crucial at larger radii.

Figure 3 shows the impact parameter dependence upon \(\eta\) for \(p_{\perp}\) = 100, 10 and 5 GeV. At 100 GeV multiple scattering is negligible and the resolution term 'A' dominates. There is no dependence on \(\eta\) except for a step corresponding to the transition from cylinders to disks. The transition, apart from saving detector area, avoids the deterioration of the resolution as \(\eta\) increases, which would happen for lower values of \(p_{\perp}\). This deterioration is especially rapid for \(|\eta|\) > 2.0. It is probably academic anyway to consider cylinders extending that far, even for small radii.

### Rejection against \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\)

We now turn to a study of the rejection of impact parameter cuts against the dominant non-reducible backgrounds to a possible signal from \(H\to ZZ^{*}\to llll\) decays, as suggested in [2]. These are the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) backgrounds, which are the dominant ones even after strict isolation cuts [3]. In order to study realistically how much further they can be reduced, we used the impact parameter measurement, which was simulated using the resolution which varies with track momentum and polar angle, as described above.

The normalized quantity,

\[f\ =\ d\ /\ \sigma_{ip}(p_{\perp},\theta),\]

where \(d\) is the measured impact parameter value, has been used for each track in the simulations described below. In fact we have to deal with a variable number of lepton tracks, since a total number of up to four leptons may be measured in the vertex detector acceptance. This number may in general be smaller than four,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Resolution & \(A_{e}\) & \(A_{d}\) & \(B_{e}\) & \(B_{d}\) \\ \hline Optimistic & 14.0 & 24.0 & 240.0 & 345.0 \\ Standard & 27.0 & 40.0 & 240.0 & 345.0 \\ Pessimistic & 49.0 & 75.0 & 450.0 & 555.0 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline \(\eta\)-coverage of the vertex detector & Average number of leptons seen. \\ \hline
1.0 & 2.3 \\

\end{table}
Table 3: _Average number of leptons seen in vertex detector as a function of it’s \(\eta\)-coverage for intermediate mass Higgs signal events with four leptons passing the selection cuts described above._because the vertex detector \(\eta\)-coverage may be more restricted than the ATLAS lepton acceptance, assumed to be over \(|\eta|<2.5\). We have therefore defined a single parameter \(x\), which was used to separate signal and background events. The following definitions of \(x\) were used:

\[x = \sum_{i=1}^{4}f_{i} \tag{1}\] \[x = \sum_{i=1}^{4}f_{i}^{2}\] (2) \[x = \max\left(f_{i}:i=1,4\right) \tag{3}\]

No big difference in performance was observed, but the third definition turned out to be the best of the above, and was used in the following. The distribution of \(x\), for \(H\to llll\) and \(t\bar{t}\to llll\) events, is shown in fig. 4 for a'standard' impact parameter resolution. It is clear that one can choose a cut that will lead to a good rejection of background while conserving almost all the signal. The distribution for the Higgs signal shows no non-Gaussian tails, because no pattern recognition simulation was performed in this study. No particular difficulties are expected however, because only high \(P_{\perp}\) isolated tracks are involved.

The background rejection has been calculated for two sets of analysis cuts used for the intermediate mass Higgs search. In both cases a pair of leptons with \(P_{\perp}>20\) GeV was required, with invariant mass within \(\pm\) 6 GeV from the \(Z\) mass. The mass of the second lepton pair was required to be above 12 GeV. Figures 5 and 6 show the rejection against \(Zb\bar{b}\) and \(t\bar{t}\) as a function of the vertex detector \(\eta\)-coverage, for a signal efficiency of 85%. For the second lepton pair the lepton \(P_{\perp}\) cut was 10 GeV (fig. 5) and 7 GeV (fig. 6). For lower momenta the impact parameter resolution deteriorates, and this worsens the background rejection. At the same time however the proportion of leptons from cascade decays increases, and the rejection of these is larger, since they are expected to result in larger observed impact parameters. These two effects roughly compensate for the \(t\bar{t}\) background. For \(Zb\bar{b}\) events, cascade decays are not included in the simulation, because they were shown to be rejected efficiently by the 12 GeV mass cut on the second lepton pair. The \(Zb\bar{b}\) rejection is therefore worse for \(P_{\perp}>7\) GeV than for \(P_{\perp}>10\) GeV. The leptons are always expected to be measured over \(|\eta|~{}<~{}2.5\). The average number of leptons seen in the vertex detector per Higgs decay is shown in Table 3 as a function of the \(\eta\)-coverage of the vertex detector.

The final rejection depends strongly both on the impact parameter resolution and on the \(\eta\)-coverage of the vertex detector. For a modest \(\eta\)-coverage of \(\pm 1.5\), a rejection of \(\sim 4\) can be easily achieved. With an \(\eta\)-coverage extended to \(\pm\) 2.0, we obtain rejections of 6 ('standard') and 8 ('optimistic') against the background with a signal efficiency of 85%.

## 2 Update on \(t\overline{t}\) background from cascade decays

### Acceptance with new top quark fragmentation

In a previous note [4], it was shown that a significant fraction of the \(t\overline{t}\) background comes from cascade decays: indeed the \(t\overline{t}\) background increases by a factor \(\thicksim 3\) after the cuts decribed in the LoI with respect to the original estimates, where the \(W\) and \(b\) were forced into leptons. At the same time it was noticed that the fragmentation function used for the b-quark from top decay was incorrect [5], and a new corrected sample of \(t\overline{t}\to llll\) events was generated by R. Hawkings, including leptons from cascade decays. Given the \(t\overline{t}\) production cross-section of 3300 pb, this sample corresponds to almost 11% of an LHC year at \(10^{34}\ cm^{-2}s^{-1}\).

For events passing the LoI cuts, fig. 7 shows the distribution of lepton parents, for three different cuts on the lepton \(P_{\perp}\). In Table 4 are summarised the numbers of events containing or not leptons from cascade decays after the LoI cuts.

As before with the old fragmentation, the total \(t\overline{t}\) background is larger by roughly a factor 3 than the direct \(t\overline{t}\) background. Surprisingly this factor increases very slowly when the \(P_{\perp}\) cut on the leptons decreases. We note here that events with more than four leptons passing the selection cuts were rejected. This cut reduces the Higgs signal by 2.6% (\(P_{\perp}>10\) GeV) to 4.7% (\(P_{\perp}>5\) GeV), but rejects 17.4% (\(P_{\perp}>10\) GeV) to 32.7% (\(P_{\perp}>5\) GeV) of the \(t\overline{t}\) background.

### Rejection of isolation cuts against leptons from cascade decays

To take into account the effect of cascade decays, the rates for \(t\overline{t}\to llll\) events after acceptance and isolation cuts were conservatively multiplied by a factor three until now. This meant that the same rejection factor for isolation cuts was assumed for leptons from b-quark decays and for those from cascade decays. In the followingwe show that this factor was pessimistic, since the leptons from cascade decays are less isolated than those from direct b-quark decay. Table 5 shows the rejections at particle level of isolation cuts per lepton of given origin and for the three lepton \(P_{\perp}\)-cuts quoted above (the isolation cuts were applied after the kinematic cuts). The criterion used for the isolation cut is that a lepton is kept if no charged particle of \(P_{\perp}>2\) GeV is present within a cone of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\) = 0.15 around the lepton track. For leptons from u and d quarks, a lower limit was computed since no event (or only one event) survived these isolation cuts.

As expected the rejection of the isolation cuts decreases as the \(P_{\perp}\)-lepton cut decreases, and is much better for light quarks and c quarks. The ratio of the rejections for leptons from c-quarks and b-quarks is \(\sim\) 8 and not very sensitive to the value of the \(P_{\perp}\)-cut. The leptons from b-decays in direct \(t\overline{t}\) events (where the four leptons come directly from the \(WWb\overline{b}\) final state) are less well isolated than those from b-decays in cascade \(t\overline{t}\) events. The isolation has essentially no effect on leptons from \(\tau\) or \(W\) decays, as expected in the absence of pile-up.

### Composition of residual background after isolation cuts

In order to estimate the residual \(t\overline{t}\) background to the Higgs signal, the kinematic and isolation cuts were combined. Table 6 shows for the three different \(P_{\perp}\)-cuts, the rejections per event and the expected rates of surviving events, for direct decays and cascade decays. The ratios for total to direct \(t\overline{t}\) rates, shown previously in Table 4, have been recomputed after isolation cuts. The rates between brackets were obtained using isolation cuts within a larger cone of \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}=0.20\).

From Table 4 it can be seen that the \(t\overline{t}\) background from cascade decays is about twice as large as the direct \(t\overline{t}\) background. But, as shown in Table 6, the rejection of the isolation cuts is about 8 to 10 times better for cascade decays, so that the final overall \(t\overline{t}\) background is only 25% to 33% greater than the direct one. The

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(P_{\perp}\) cut & u and d & c & b (dir. \(t\overline{t}\)) & b (casc. \(t\overline{t}\)) & \(\tau\) & W \\ \hline \hline 5 GeV & \(>29\) & \(30\pm 5\) & \(3.2\pm 0.2\) & \(5.7\pm 0.4\) & \(1.63\pm 0.08\) & \(1.05\pm 0.01\) \\ \hline \hline
7 GeV & \(>47\) & \(50\pm 14\) & \(3.7\pm 0.2\) & \(6.7\pm 0.6\) & \(1.70\pm 0.10\) & \(1.05\pm 0.01\) \\ \hline
10 GeV & \(>125\) & \(57\pm 21\) & \(5.5\pm 0.5\) & \(11.1\pm 1.5\) & \(1.70\pm 0.12\) & \(1.05\pm 0.01\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: _Isolation cut rejection factors per lepton from \(t\overline{t}\to\) llll decays, as a function of the origin of the lepton (see text for definition of direct and cascade \(t\overline{t}\) events._conclusion is therefore that the rates quoted in [3] for the overall \(t\overline{t}\) background were too conservative and overestimated by a factor \(\sim 2.4\).

It may be interesting for further simulations to identify clearlywhere the residual \(t\overline{t}\) background from cascade decays comes from. Table 7 classifies the events observed after all cuts in terms of the origin of the lepton which does not come directly from W or b-quark decay.

Although care was taken to apply rather conservative tracking isolation cuts only, final conclusions on the exact level of non-reducible backgrounds to the intermediate mass Higgs signal, after kinematic and isolation cuts, will be reached only when full GEANT simulations of the signal and background events will have been performed and analysed.

## 3 Estimates of signal and total background rates

In this last Section, the overall prospects for intermediate mass Higgs to 4-lepton searches are reviewed in light of the most recent studies discussed above.

### Monte-Carlo samples

The Monte-Carlo samples used for the signal were generated with PYTHIA 5.6, with only Higgs decays into four electrons, which is the most difficult case for isolation studies [6]. Samples of about 2700 events are available in GENZ format on tapes LH0129 to LH0135 for Higgs masses of 120 to 180 GeV in steps of 10 GeV.

A sample of irreducible background from \(q\overline{q}\to ZZ^{\star}\to eeee\) has been generated using PYTHIA 5.6, including the photon propagator, with generation level cuts of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline  & \(P_{\perp}>5\) GeV & \(P_{\perp}>7\) GeV & \(P_{\perp}>10\) GeV \\ \hline Rejection (dir. \(t\overline{t}\)) & \(9.1\pm 1.3\) & \(10.9\pm 1.8\) & \(20.1\pm 5.9\) \\ \hline Rejection (casc. \(t\overline{t}\)) & \(63.3\pm 16.2\) & \(85.1\pm 29.9\) & \(212\pm 149\) \\ \hline Residual bgd (dir. \(t\overline{t}\)) & \(420\pm 60(210\pm 40)\) & \(290\pm 50(160\pm 40)\) & \(100\pm 30(60\pm 20)\) \\ \hline Residual bgd (casc. \(t\overline{t}\)) & \(140\pm 40(60\pm 20)\) & \(75\pm 25(30\pm 20)\) & \(20\pm 13(<20)\) \\ \hline Total \(t\overline{t}\) / Direct \(t\overline{t}\) & \(1.33\pm 0.09\) & \(1.26\pm 0.10\) & \(1.22\pm 0.17\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The 4-lepton background from \(t\overline{t}\) decays was generated using PYTHIA 5.6, without forcing top decays [4], and using the more correct fragmentation scheme described in [5]. The top quark mass chosen was 140 GeV and all events containing at least four leptons (electrons or muons), with \(P_{\perp}>5\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.6\), the invariant mass of one lepton pair within \(\pm\) 15 GeV of the Z mass, and with signs and flavours consistent with originating from the decay of a ZZ pair. A total of about 9000 events were written out to tape (LH1060 and LH1069), corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 1.07 10\({}^{4}\)\(pb^{-1}\).

Finally the background from \(Zb\overline{b}\) events was first generated using an exact matrix element calculation for \(gg\to Zb\overline{b}\)[8], which accounts for about 90% of \(Zb\overline{b}\) final states at LHC. Events of this type can also be produced using initial state parton showering with PYTHIA or ISAJET, but it has been shown that the softer b-quark spectrum is not well reproduced by this approach and that the background from this process would thus be underestimated [9]. Approximately 18000 events of this type were generated and then interfaced to PYTHIA 5.6 to produce the proper b-quark fragmentation and the underlying event. Data from LEP strongly suggest that one should use a Peterson fragmentation [10] for the b-quarks, with a choice of \(\epsilon_{b}=-0.006\pm 0.002\)[11]. The systematics on the background rate estimates due to the uncertainty on \(\epsilon_{b}\) were estimated using these 18000 \(Zb\overline{b}\) events with \(Z\to ee\), fragmented with \(\epsilon_{b}=-0.006\) (tapes LH0098-99), \(\epsilon_{b}=-0.004\) (tapes LH0100-101) and \(\epsilon_{b}=-0.008\) (tapes LH0102-103).

\end{table}
Table 7: _Identification of the events from cascade decays after isolation and acceptance cuts._

### Signal and background rates versus lepton \(P_{\perp}\)-threshold

All these Monte-Carlo samples have been analysed with the same cuts as in the LoI: \(\bullet\) at least four leptons are found within \(|\eta|<2.5\) and with \(P_{\perp}>10\), 7 or 5 GeV: \(\bullet\) the charges and flavours of these leptons are consistent with ZZ decay; \(\bullet\) at least one lepton pair (of proper flavour and charge) has an invariant mass within \(\pm\) 6 GeV of the Z mass; \(\bullet\) the other lepton pair has an invariant mass larger than 12 GeV.

As in the LoI, the rates are computed including an efficiency factor of 0.90\({}^{4}\) for reconstruction of the four leptons and of 0.90 for events with at least one lepton in a detector crack (barrel-endcap crack for the electromagnetic calorimetry or muon system blind spots). An additional efficiency factor of 0.95 has been included in the signal rates to take into account the effect of a \(\pm 2\sigma\) cut on the 4-lepton invariant mass around the Higgs mass. The background rates are evaluated over the same mass interval, which is around 8 GeV.

Table 8 shows the expected signal and background rates for the chosen lepton \(P_{\perp}\)-thresholds of 10,7 and 5 GeV respectively and for an integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}\)\(pb^{-1}\), before any isolation cuts are applied to the leptons (these numbers are therefore somewhat academic since the electron calorimeter trigger will necessarily imply some isolation). The quoted errors reflect the Monte-Carlo sample statistics only. Not surprisingly, the expected signal rates increase substantially for Higgs masses below 130 GeV, when the lepton \(P_{\perp}\)-threshold is decreased from 10 GeV to 5 GeV. Unfortunately the background rates increase much faster and the overall significance is worse for the lower \(P_{\perp}\)-threshold. This faster background increase is illustrated in figs. 8, 9, 10, which show the distribution of the fraction of events with \(P_{\perp}>10\) GeV with respect to those with \(P_{\perp}>5\) GeV as a function of the 4-lepton invariant mass for the \(t\bar{t}\), \(Zb\bar{b}\) and \(ZZ^{*}\) backgrounds respectively.

### Signal and background rates versus lepton \(\eta\)-coverage

This study was performed to evaluate the impact of the ATLAS staging scenario on the intermediate mass Higgs search. Table 9 shows the signal and background rates as in Table 8, for an overall lepton \(\eta\)-coverage reduced to \(|\eta|<1.4\).

Table 9 shows that the losses due to such a staging scenario are quite large. The relative acceptance of the staged \(\eta\)-coverage with respect to the full one does vary somewhat as a function of the physics process and of the lepton \(P_{\perp}\)-threshold, as is summarised below:

* \(t\bar{t}\) 0.47 \(\pm\) 0.02 (\(P_{\perp}>10\) GeV) to 0.42 \(\pm\) 0.02 (\(P_{\perp}>5\) GeV)
* \(Zb\bar{b}\) 0.34 \(\pm\) 0.04 (\(P_{\perp}>10\) GeV) to 0.26 \(\pm\) 0.02 (\(P_{\perp}>5\) GeV)

### Effect of impact parameter and lepton isolation cuts

In this final Section we consider two cases:

\(\bullet\) a) a total integrated luminosity of \(2~{}\times~{}10^{4}~{}pb^{-1}\), corresponding to two years of running at a luminosity of \(10^{33}~{}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). Impact parameter cuts with the rejections quoted in Section 1 against the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) backgrounds and with an efficiency of 85% for the Higgs signal and irreducible \(ZZ^{\star}\) background are applied. Lepton isolation cuts are also applied to further reject the reducible backgrounds. The rejection of such cuts was evaluated realistically for the direct \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) backgrounds, as discussed in [6]. In the absence of pile-up, rejections of 30 against direct \(t\bar{t}\) and of 15 against \(Zb\bar{b}\) can be achieved with an efficiency of 85% for the Higgs signal and the irreducible \(ZZ^{\star}\) background. Events with leptons from cascade \(t\bar{t}\) decays are assumed to be rejected by a factor of 240, as discussed in Section 2.

\(\bullet\) b) a total integrated luminosity of \(10^{5}~{}pb^{-1}\), corresponding to one year of running at a luminosity of \(10^{34}~{}cm^{-2}s^{-1}\). In this case we assume that no rejection can be obtained from impact parameter cuts and that the efficiency of the lepton isolation cuts is reduced to 50%, due to pile-up effects in both the calorimeter and the tracking detectors, as discussed in [6].

Tables 10 (case a) and 11 (case b) show the expected signal and background rates for the three different lepton \(P_{\perp}\)-thresholds. A comparison between these two Tables clearly shows the benefit in detector performance of low luminosity running. This benefit is twofold: impact parameter cuts are possible and the lepton isolation cuts are more efficient. As a result the backgrounds from \(t\bar{t}\) and \(Zb\bar{b}\) can be reduced to less than 20% of the irreducible \(ZZ^{\star}\) background, which is not the case at high luminosity. A reduction of the lepton \(P_{\perp}\)-threshold is only beneficial at low luminosity and for Higgs masses around 130 GeV. At larger Higgs masses the increase in signal rate is marginal and offset by the faster increase in background rates.

Even though the significances in Table 10 are above 5 for all Higgs masses larger than 130 GeV, they should not be taken literally, since the signal rates are too low,
