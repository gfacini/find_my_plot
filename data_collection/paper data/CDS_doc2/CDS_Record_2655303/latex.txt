## 1 Introduction

The LHC provides a unique opportunity to study the scattering of massive vector bosons (VBS). Such scattering is a crucial probe of electroweak symmetry breaking [1; 2; 3]. In the Standard Model, the exchange of a Higgs boson ensures unitarity for this process. Many beyond-the-Standard Model (BSM) theories predict enhancements in the VBS rate [4; 5].

The production of same-sign \(W\)-bosons in association with two jets (\(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\)) is of special interest. For this process, with appropriate fiducial cuts on the dijet invariant mass and the rapidity separation between the jets, it is possible to identify a kinematic region where electroweak production, which includes VBS diagrams (\(\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{6})\) at leading order), dominates over strong production (\(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{s}^{2}\alpha^{4})\) at leading order). Observation of \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) electroweak production has been reported by the CMS collaboration [6] and by the ATLAS collaboration [7] using data recorded at a center-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV.

As the ATLAS and CMS experiments accumulate more data, the precision of such VBS measurements will improve. The ability to use these data to constrain BSM theories will depend on having reliable theoretical predictions with well understood systematic uncertainties. The consistency of predicted cross sections and kinematic distributions has been studied for the case of \(W^{+}W^{+}jj\) production where one \(W\) boson decays to an electron and the other to a muon in Ref. [8] both at leading order (LO) and next-to-leading order (NLO). This study was performed using a fiducial selection where weak production dominates and where the same values for the Standard Model input parameters are used for all the calculations. It concluded that for fixed-order calculations of the fiducial cross section, the different calculations and approximations agree to better than 1% at LO and 3% at NLO. Fiducial cross sections after matching these calculations to parton showers agree to about 7%, but much larger differences are observed in some differential distributions.

This note extends the work of Ref. [8] in three ways. First, it adds an additional generator (Sherpa[9]) and additional generator configurations to the comparisons. Second, it provides predictions for the fiducial cross section and for kinematic distributions using the fiducial cuts corresponding to recently presented ATLAS results [7]. Finally, in addition to presenting predictions for the process \(pp\to\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}e^{+}\nu_{e}jj\), it extends the phase space to the full process \(pp\to\ell^{\pm}\nu_{\ell}\ell^{\prime\pm}\nu_{\ell^{\prime}}jj\) (where \(\ell\) and \(\ell^{\prime}\) are either an electron or muon and where \(\nu_{\ell}\) and \(\nu_{\ell^{\prime}}\) represent either a neutrino or anti-neutrino, as appropriate).

## 2 Generators and Generator Configurations

Examples of tree-level diagrams that contribute to electroweak same-sign \(WW\) production are shown in Figure 1. These diagrams can be classified as VBS (which are sensitive to the quartic gauge coupling), t-channel (where the inital and final quarks are connected by a continuous fermion line)1, s-channel decay chain (where initial quark and antiquark legs annihilate) and tri-boson (where the two final state jets are produced from a virtual vector boson). The sum of the s-channel decay chain and tri-boson diagrams are henceforce called s-channel production.

Footnote 1: u-channel diagrams have the same quark content as the t-channel, but with crossed quark lines

Hard scattering cross sections for electroweak \(pp\to\ell^{\pm}\nu_{\ell}\ell^{\prime\pm}\nu_{\ell^{\prime}}jj\) production at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV are calculated using three Monte Carlo generators: MadGraph5_aMC@NLO[10], Powheg-Box[11; 12; 13; 14], and Sherpa. For MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Powheg-Box, samples are generated both using Pythia 8(PY8) [15] and using Herwig 7 (H7) [16; 17; 18] for the parton shower, hadronisation and simulation of underling event. Sherpa uses its own model to simulate these effects.

The configurations used in the predictions are:

* **MadGraph5_aMC@NLO** (henceforth MG5_aMC) samples are generated both for LO and NLO configurations using MG5_aMC version 2.6.2 and the PDF set NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118 [19]. The Electroweak coupling is renormalised in the \(G_{\mu}\) scheme using the commands set complex_mass_scheme import model loop_qcd_qcd_Gmu All particle masses and \(G_{F}\) are kept at the values given in the default parameter card provided with the MG5_aMC code distribution: \(G_{F}=1.166390\times 10^{-05}\) GeV\({}^{-2}\), \(m_{t}=173.3\) GeV, \(m_{W}=80.41900\) GeV, \(m_{Z}=91.188000\) GeV and \(m_{h}=125.0\) GeV. The \(W\) and Higgs boson decay widths are calculated at NLO accuracy to be \(\Gamma_{W}=2.092910\) GeV and \(\Gamma_{H}=4.074680\times 10^{-3}\) GeV. These values of \(G_{F}\), \(m_{Z}\) and \(m_{W}\) differ from those used in Ref. [8]. The strong coupling constant is specified to be \(\alpha_{S}(m_{Z})=0.118\). The factorization and renormalization scale are chosen to use the same functional form as in Ref. [8], \(\mu_{\mathrm{ F}}=\mu_{\mathrm{ R}}=\sqrt{p_{\mathrm{ T}}^{\mathrm{ jet1}}\,\,p_{\mathrm{ T}}^{\mathrm{ jet2}}}\) (where \(p_{\mathrm{ T}}^{\mathrm{ jet1}}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{ T}}^{\mathrm{ jet2}}\) are values of the transverse momentum of the leading and subleading jets respectively). LO samples are generated using the commands of the form generate p p > e+ ve mu+ vm jj QCD=0

Figure 1: Examples of tree level diagrams that contribute to electroweak \(pp\to\ell^{\pm}\nu_{\ell}\ell^{\pm}\nu_{\ell}jj\) production. These contributions are classified as (a) VBS, (b) t-channel, (c) s-channel decay chain and (d) tri-boson. The combined contributions of the s-channel decay and tri-boson diagrams are together referred to as s-channel production. These drawings were produced using MG5_aMC.

NLO samples are produced using the commands of the form generate p p > W+ W+ jj QCD=0 [QCD] where the \(W\) bosons are decayed using MadSpin [20]. Because MadSpin uses a LO calculation of the partial and total \(W\) decay widths, the resulting total and differential cross sections are rescaled by a constant factor that accounts for the difference between the LO (2.04872 GeV) and NLO (2.092910 GeV) widths. Cross sections corrected in this manner are labeled, "\(\Gamma_{\text{resc}}\)." Matching to parton showers uses the MC@NLO method [21] using FKS subtraction [22]. Samples showered with Pythia 8 (MG5_aMC+PY8) use Pythia version 8.235 and the A14 set of tunable parameters [23]. Pythia 8 with its default settings produces samples with too much radiation in the central region of rapidity for VBS processes. This tendency can be mitigated by using a new dipole-recoil scheme [24], where only one final-state parton takes the recoil of an emission, rather than the default \(p_{\text{T}}\)-ordered shower for ISR emissions, where the recoil of an ISR emission is taken by the whole final state. The effects of changing the recoil scheme are studied for LO samples. The dipole-recoil scheme is not compatible with the MG5_aMC matching scheme (although it is compatible with Powheg matching). Hence that option is not used in the NLO case for MG5_aMC. Samples showered with Herwig 7 use Herwig version 7.1.3 [18] with the H7.1-Default hadronisation and underlying event tunes [17]. Both the angular ordered and dipole shower models are studied for the LO samples. Only the angular ordered shower is compatible with MG5_aMC matching scheme.
* **Powheg-Box** version 2 is used to produce electroweak events at NLO QCD [14] using the process specified as POWHEG-BOX/VBF_Wp_Wp) [25]. Events are generated at the matrix-element level using PDF set NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118 and are stored as LHE files that serve as input to the shower model. The Powheg-Box base revision used to produce the integrations and LHE events is r3208 and the process-specific revision is r3178. The sample is inclusive in regard to the leptonic decay flavors from the W bosons. The process does not include non-\(WW\) contributions that would produce the same final state (eg, s-channel production). The renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to the nominal \(W\) boson mass. The withdamp and bornzerodamp flags are set in Powheg-Box to ensure that any singularity in the integrated phase-space is handled properly. These LHE events are showered both with Pythia 8 and with Herwig 7. Samples showered with Pythia 8 (Powheg +PY8) use Pythia version 8.235 and the AZNLO tune [26]. Samples are produced both with the global and the dipole-recoil schemes. Samples showered with Herwig 7 use version 7.1.3 with the H7.1-Default underlying event tunes. Both the angular ordered and dipole shower models are studied.
* **Shera** samples are simulated with the Sherpa version 2.2.2 event generator. Matrix elements contain all diagrams with six electroweak vertices. They are calculated for up to 1 additional parton at LO using Comix [27] and merged with the Sherpa parton shower [28] according to the CKKW ME+PS@LO prescription [29]. The NNPDF30_nnlo_as_0118 PDF set is used in conjunction with dedicated parton shower tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. The EW coupling is renormalised in the \(G_{\mu}\) scheme with \(G_{F}=1.166397\times 10^{-5}\) GeV\({}^{-2}\). The factorization and renormalization scales are set dynamically to the diboson invariant mass. Shera VBS samples suffer from a non-optimal setting of the color flow setup for the parton shower on top of VBS-like scattering processes, leading to an excess of central emissions from the parton shower [30]. The same-sign Sherpa_CKKW sample includes one additional jet in the matrix element, thus correcting for the shape effects of this shower mismodelling, but leading to significantly reduced predicted cross sections due to the large suppression from spuriously large Sudakov factors

To facilitate comparison with other generators, LO samples with no additional partons are also generated. The effect of the scale choice on the cross section is studied using two dynamic choices of scale, diboson invariant mass and \(\sqrt{p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet1}}\ p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jet2}}}\).

A summary of the generator configurations used for these studies is provided in Table 1.

## 3 Definition of Fiducial Regions

Events are required to contain two leptons (electrons or muons) of the same electric charge and at least two jets. Dressed leptons are used; the momenta of all photons found within a radius \(\Delta R=0.1\) of the lepton are added to the lepton momentum. Leptons originating from \(\tau\) decays are excluded. Jets are reconstructed by clustering stable particles excluding neutrinos and prompt leptons using the infrared- and collinear-safe anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [31] with radius parameter \(R=0.4\) using the FastJet package [32].

Cross sections and kinematic distributions are studied for two choices of fiducial region. The first fiducial region corresponds to that used in Ref. [8]. Cross sections for the process \(pp\to\mu^{+}\nu_{\mu}e^{+}\nu_{e}jj\) are calculated

## 4 Fiducial Cross Sections

Table 2 presents the fiducial cross sections for the different generator configurations using the fiducial region defined in Ref. [8]. For the NLO calculations, scale and PDF uncertainties are also provided. These uncertainties are usually small under changes of configuration of the parton shower model and therefore are only provided for one configuration of each NLO generator. Scale uncertainties are obtained from the maximum deviation of the nine-point scale variation (varying \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) independently by a factor of 2 in

each direction). PDF uncertainties are obtained using the 101 members of the NNPDF30_nlo_as_0118 PDF set combined using the software provided with the LHAPDF library version 6.1.5 [33].

Cross sections calculated using MG5_aMC and Powheg agree to about 3% with those calculated in Ref. [8]. The NLO MG5_aMC cross section is about 10% higher than LO MG5_aMC. The difference in fiducial cross sections calculated using the two NLO calculations (MG5_aMC and Powheg) is about 10%, larger than the approximately \(\pm\)2% uncertainty obtained by combining statistical, scale and PDF uncertainties. One possible source of the observed difference between Powheg and MG5_aMC is the absence of the s-channel diagram in the Powheg configuration. Changes in the choice of shower model for a given hard scattering calculation (e.g. differences between Pythia 8, Herwig 7 and differences between dipole and angular ordered shower) are at most of order 5%.

Sherpa_CKKW predicts a cross section that is 65% of the MG5_aMC cross section. The source of this discrepancy was discussed in Section 2. Sherpa_LO-0 and Sherpa_LO-1 predict rates that are 83% and 89% of the MG5_aMC rate respectively, indicating that the non-optimal color flow setup has a smaller effect on the LO configurations than for the CKKW merged case.

Table 3 shows similar results for the fiducial region used by ATLAS. Comparisons among generator configurations exhibit similar patterns to the previous table. All MG5_aMC and Powheg configurations agree to better than 10% while Sherpa_CKKW predicts a cross section that is 62% of MG5_aMC.

## 5 Kinematic Distributions for Samples Used in ATLAS Analyses

Although the performance of a wide variety of generator setups have been studied at generator level, only two electroweak same-sign \(WW\) samples have been processed through the ATLAS detector simulation. These are Sherpa_CKKW and Powheg +PY8. The observation of \(W^{\pm}W^{\pm}jj\) electroweak production reported in Ref. [7] was based on studies performed using these samples. In Figure 2 kinematic distributions for these generator configurations are compared to those obtained from MG5_aMC_NLO+H7 for the ATLAS fiducial region defined in Section 3. Differences in the shape of the dijet invariant mass distribution between the two samples is as large as 30% at the lowest and highest values of \(m_{jj}\). These samples differ from MG5_aMC_NLO+H7 by up to about 20% and bracket the MG5_aMC prediction. Powheg and MG5_aMC are in good agreement in the low \(m_{jj}\) region, although Powheg produces a slightly harder spectrum at high \(m_{jj}\) All three generators predict similar distributions of dilepton invariant mass. Sherpa predicts a slightly narrower distibution of \(\Delta y_{jj}\), with a difference of up to 20% in cross section close to the \(\Delta y_{jj}>2.0\) fiducial cut. The Zeppenfeld variable for the third jet [34]:

\[z_{3} = \frac{y^{\mathrm{jet}3}-\frac{1}{2}\left(y^{\mathrm{jet}1}+y^{ \mathrm{jet}2}\right)}{\left|\left(y^{\mathrm{jet}1}-y^{\mathrm{jet}2}\right) \right|}\]

is sensitive to the rapidity distribution of additional radiation, with small values of \(z_{3}\) corresponding to events where the third jet is central and large values corresponding to events where the third jet is found at large rapidity. The distribution of \(z_{3}\) peaks at about 0.55 for all three generators, although Sherpa and Powheg favor slightly lower values of \(z_{3}\) than MG5_aMC. Significant differences in jet multiplicity appear only for the case of at least 4 jets in the event, a region dominated by the configuration of the parton shower model.

Ratios are calculated with respect to MG5_aMC_NLO+H7. The yellow band corresponds to the quadratic sum of the statistical, PDF and scale uncertainties.

## 6 Kinematic Distributions for Different Shower Configurations

The effect of the choice of shower model on the predicted kinematic distributions for Powheg and for MG5_aMC are studied. Differential cross sections for the ATLAS fiducial region are shown in Figures 3 through 7. These same distributions for the fiducial region defined in Ref. [8] are shown in Appendix A. Separate plots are provided for LO and NLO configurations. In all cases, the ratio of the differential cross section to that obtained with MG5_aMC_NLO+H7, \(\Gamma_{\mathrm{resc}}\) is displayed.

Figure 3 shows the invariant mass of the two leading jets in the event. LO calculations are somewhat softer than NLO. A comparison of NLO configurations shows that Powheg exhibits a slightly harder spectrum than MG5_aMC, leading to differences in cross section of up to 20% at high invariant mass. Effects due to the choice of shower model are small.

Figure 4 shows the invariant mass of the dilepton pair. The shape of this variable is insensitive to the choice of generator and shower model both for LO and NLO configurations.

Figure 5 presents the Zeppenfeld variable for the third-hardest jet. Only events where there is a third jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV are included in the distribution. This distribution shows significant differences among configurations. Both LO and NLO MG5_aMC+PY8 with the default Pythia 8 shower exhibit an excess of jets at low values of \(z_{3}\). For LO MG5_aMC, using the dipole-recoil option restores agreement with Powheg and with MG5_aMC+H7. Powheg distributions of \(z_{3}\) are peaked slightly lower than for MG5_aMC+H7. Differences between the LO and NLO MG5_aMC+H7 configurations are small.

Figure 6 shows the rapidity difference between the two leading jets. Differences in the shape of these distributions between Powheg and MG5_aMC are small, with some discrepancies appearing for \(\Delta y_{jj}\) above 6. At small \(\Delta y_{jj}\), differences of order 10% are observed.

Figure 7 shows the jet multiplicity distribution for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\) GeV. Significant differences between configurations are observed. Because the LO (NLO) matrix element calculation includes only events with two (up to three) jets, predictions for higher jet multiplicities depend on the choice of shower model and the values of showering and hadronisation parameters. Such differences in jet multiplicity are therefore expected.

## 7 Conclusions

Predictions for electroweak scattering for same sign \(W\) boson pairs have been studied for three matrix element calculations, MG5_aMC, Powheg and Sherpa. The MG5_aMC and Powheg calculations have been matched to parton showers using both Pythia 8 and Herwig 7. Predictions for the fiducial cross section calculated with Powheg and with MG5_aMC agree to within about 10%. Differences in differential distributions of kinematic observables are larger. Modeling of the amount of additional radiation in these events is especially sensitive to details of the showering model, with large differences observed in the Zeppenfeld variable. These conclusions are consistent with those obtained in Ref. [8].

## Appendix A:

Kinematic Distributions for Different Shower Configurations, Ref. [8] Fiducial Region

This appendix presents kinematic distributions analogous to those in Sections 5 and 6 but using the same fiducial cuts as in Ref. [8]. Figure 8 shows the normalized differential distributions for the Sherpa_CKKW and Powheg +PY8 samples, together with the ratio of their predictions to those obtained with MG5_aMC_NLO+H7. Figures 9 through 13 show the differential distributions for different LO configurations of MG5_aMC and NLO configurations of MG5_aMC and Powheg-Box with Pythia 8 and Herwig 7 for the kinematic variables \(m_{jj}\), \(m_{\ell\ell}\), \(z_{3}\), \(\Delta y_{jj}\) and jet multiplicity. Differences in the predictions for the different configurations exhibit similar patterns to those observed using the ATLAS fiducial requirements.
