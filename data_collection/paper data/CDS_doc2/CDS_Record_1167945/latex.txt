In the initial phase of the LHC operation at low luminosity several Standard Model physics analyses will be performed in order to validate the ATLAS detector and trigger system. The \(B^{+}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(J/\psi K^{+}\) channel can be observed with the first ATLAS data at LHC and can be used for detector performance studies. This channel will provide a reference in the search for rare \(B\) decays. It will also be used to estimate the systematic uncertainties and efficiencies of flavor tagging algorithms, needed for \(CP\) violation measurements. The prospects to measure the \(B^{+}\) mass, its total and differential production cross sections and lifetime with the first ATLAS data, are described in this note.

Introduction

The expected large hadronic cross-section for \(b\)-quark production and the high luminosity at the LHC leads to copious \(b\)-quark production, with the presence of a \(b\bar{b}\) pair in about one percent of the collisions. Quantitatively, the expected inclusive production cross-section for \(pp\to b\bar{b}+X\) at LHC is estimated to be \(\sigma_{b\bar{b}}\approx 500\)\(\mu\)b leading to more than \(10^{5}\)\(b\bar{b}\) pairs per second at the LHC design luminosity of \({\cal L}\approx 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). However, the extrapolation of the \(b\bar{b}\) cross-section measurement from the Tevatron energy of 1.8-1.96 TeV [1, 2] to the LHC energy of 14 TeV suffers from large uncertainties. The theoretical predictions are based on NLO QCD calculations with uncertainties smaller than 20 % [3] in the kinematical region of the LHC, originating mainly from scale uncertainties [4], as well as uncertainties due to the parton density functions and the \(b\)-fragmentation.

A precise measurement of the \(b\bar{b}\) inclusive cross-section at the LHC can be used to constrain these theoretical uncertainties. In addition, the large production rate allows for exclusive cross-section measurements shortly after the LHC start up, which have different systematic uncertainties and model dependencies (fragmentation models) from the inclusive ones. Furthermore, the \(b\bar{b}\) represents the largest physics background for many processes, therefore its measurement is a prerequisite to any discovery.

In this note the exclusive channel \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) is studied extensively and the procedure to measure the differential and total cross-sections with the first 10 pb\({}^{-1}\) is presented, with event selection based on the identification of the \(J/\psi\) decay to two muons.

The exclusive \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) decay can be measured during the initial luminosity phase of the LHC, because of the clear event topology and rather large branching ratio. It can serve as a reference channel for rare B decay searches, whose total and differential cross-sections will be measured relative to its cross-section, thus allowing the cancelation of common systematic uncertainties. Furthermore, it can be used to estimate the systematic uncertainties and efficiencies of flavour tagging algorithms, which are needed for CP violation measurements. Finally, the relatively large statistics for this decay allow for initial detector performance studies. In particular, the precise measurement of the well-known mass and lifetime [5] can be used for inner detector calibration and alignment studies.

In Section 2 of the note the Monte Carlo data sets used for this study are described. In Section 3 the \(J/\psi\) selection procedure is presented. The \(B^{+}\)\(\to\)\(J/\psi K^{+}\) mass, cross-section and lifetime measurements can be found in Section 4. The expected statistics during the early LHC luminosity phase are discussed in Section 5 together with estimates of the systematic uncertainties.

All the following studies have been done for luminosity of \({\cal L}=10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). However, since pile-up does not play any role at this luminosity, it is straightforward to rescale the results of these studies to \({\cal L}=10^{31}\) cm\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), in case this will be the luminosity at startup.

## 2 Monte Carlo Samples

All Monte Carlo (MC) data sets used for the studies presented in this note have been produced using Pythia-6.4[6] without overlaying pileup events.

At the generator level, the ATLAS specific Pythia implementation for \(B\)-physics which provides an interface to Pythia-6[7] was used. The study of the \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) channel is done using the inclusive

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|c|c|} \hline Process & \(N_{\rm gen}\) & \({\cal L}\) [pb\({}^{-1}\)] & \(N_{\rm gen}(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+})\) \\ \hline \hline \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi(\mu 6\mu 4)+X\) & 145 500 & 13.2 & 7 072 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Monte Carlo data set used for the \(B^{+}\) study. The \(N_{\rm gen}(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+})\) events are the ones contained in the whole generated sample.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:3]

* All possible di-muons with \(p_{T,1}\geq 3.0\) GeV and \(p_{T,2}\geq 6.0\) GeV are formed;
* The tracks of each muon pair are then fitted to a common vertex;
* From the vertices found, only the ones with \(\chi^{2}/{\rm ndf}<10\) are retained;
* To select \(J/\psi\) mesons originating from the decay of a \(B^{+}\), a cut on the proper decay length, \(\lambda>0.1\) mm, is imposed to reduce combinatorial background from prompt \(J/\psi\). If this cut is not imposed, the algorithm identifies all possible combinations consistent with \(J/\psi\) decaying to muons in the event;
* \(J/\psi\) candidates inside a mass window of 120 MeV around \(m_{J/\psi}\) are retained.

The efficiency for all previously mentioned cuts is presented in Table 2, where the efficiency after each cut is computed with respect to the previous.

Given that the sample used does not contain any prompt \(J/\psi\), the effect of the cut on the proper decay length \(\lambda\) in the table indicates the loss in signal events. As it is explained in the following section, this cut is not applied for the lifetime measurement. The \(J/\psi\) reconstruction efficiency is also given for the case of no cut on the \(J/\psi\) proper decay length \(\lambda\).

The \(J/\psi\) invariant mass distribution without a cut on \(\lambda\) is shown in Figure 1. The shape can be described by a Gaussian with exponential tails. The \(J/\psi\) mass and its resolution, obtained from a Gaussian fit, is 3098 MeV and 57.4 MeV respectively.

In order to study the effect of misalignment, displaced magnetic field and incorrect material map on the \(J/\psi\) observed mass position and resolution, a systematic study using different ATLAS geometry configurations was performed, with different combinations of possible misalignments of the calorimeter and the muon spectrometer, as well as a displaced magnetic field map and distorted material in the inner detector and the calorimeter. These studies were performed using a dedicated \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) dataset. It was found that the width of the \(J/\psi\) mass fit \(\sigma(m_{J/\psi})\) is rather stable, varying between 51 and 59 MeV.

The trigger efficiency is about 99 % and was computed from the \(J/\psi\) candidates that have at least one muon with \(p_{T}>6\) GeV in the trigger. This is expected, since at the generation level it is required that both muons from the \(J/\psi\) have \(p_{T}>6\) GeV and \(p_{T}>4\) GeV.

## 4 Analysis of the \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) Channel

The analysis that follows for the selection of \(B^{+}\) events can equally well be applied for the charge conjugate state. Negligible direct \(CP\) violation is expected in the \(B^{\pm}\to J/\psi K^{\pm}\) because for \(b\to c+\bar{c}s\) transitions the standard model predicts that the leading and higher order diagrams are characterized by the same weak phase. A measurement of the asymmetry is given in [11]. The main source of asymmetry

is the different interaction probabilities for \(K^{+}\) and \(K^{-}\) with the detector material. Other non-CP-violating sources of asymmetry are expected to lead to a lepton energy asymmetry and estimated to be negligible [12].

### Event selection

The \(B^{+}\) mesons are reconstructed from a \(J/\psi\) and a \(K^{+}\) candidate. The \(J/\psi\) selection is described in Section 3 and the \(K^{+}\) candidates are identified using information from the inner detector. Specifically, the procedure comprises the following steps:

* The original collection of tracks is scanned once again (excluding those already denoted as muons) and those with \(p_{T}>1.5\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.7\) are retained;
* From this collection, the tracks with positive charge and inconsistent with coming from the primary vertex at one standard deviation level (\(|d_{0}|/\sigma_{d_{b}}>1\), where \(d_{0}\) is the impact parameter of the track) are considered to be \(K^{+}\) candidates;
* The \(\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) pair considered to be originating from the \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) decay and the \(K^{+}\) candidate are fitted to a common vertex. The vector defined by the sum of the \(J/\psi\) and \(K^{+}\) momentum vectors is required to point to the primary vertex, and the two muon tracks are constrained to \(m_{J/\psi}\);
* Only combinations with vertex \(\chi^{2}/{\rm ndf}<6\), \(p_{T}(\mu)>5\) GeV and \(\lambda>0.1\) mm are retained;
* In case that more than two \(B^{+}\) candidates were found in the same event, the one with the smallest vertex \(\chi^{2}/{\rm ndf}\) is accepted.

### Mass fit

The \(B^{+}\) mass determination has been performed using the sample of \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi X\) decays. The \(B^{+}\) invariant mass distribution \(m(K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) of the candidates fulfilling all cuts is presented in Fig. 2. In the same figure the signal and background events can be seen separately, where the distinction between them is made using the Monte Carlo truth information. The fit to the mass distribution is done by using the

Figure 1: \(J/\psi\) invariant mass distribution with a Gaussian fit superimposed.

maximum-likelihood method, where the probability density function is a Gaussian for the signal region and a linear function for the background:

\[L = \alpha f_{\rm sig}+(1-\alpha)f_{\rm bkg}\] \[f_{\rm sig} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\sigma}e^{-\frac{1}{2}(\frac{m_{i}-m}{\sigma} )^{2}}\;, \tag{4}\] \[f_{\rm bkg} = b(m_{i}-\frac{w}{2})+\frac{1}{w}\;,\]

where \(\alpha\) is the fraction of signal events in the fitted region, \(m\) the \(B^{+}\) mass, \(b\) is the slope of the background distribution and \(w\) defines the range of the fit. The mass range of the fit is taken from 5.15 \(\,\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) to 5.8 \(\,\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). This is done in order to reduce contributions from partially reconstructed \(B\) meson decays that populate the left side of Fig. 2. The background at the right of the mass peak originates from misidentified \(\pi^{+}\) from \(B^{+}\to J/\psi\pi^{+}\) decays.

The result of the \(B^{+}\) mass fit is: \(M(B^{+})=(5279.3\pm 1.1)\)\(\,\mathrm{\,Me\kern-1.0ptV}\) with a width of \(\sigma(B^{+})=(42.2\pm 1.3)\)\(\,\mathrm{\,Me\kern-1.0ptV}\). The relative errors scaled properly for an integrated luminosity of \(\,10\)\(\mathrm{\,pb}^{-1}\)\(\,\) are about 0.02% and 3.5% respectively. The corresponding fit is presented in Fig. 3. The slight shoulder to the left of the mass distribution is due to the background shape.

### Differential and total production cross-section

The feasibility of the measurement of the \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) total and differential production cross-sections at LHC, with the first 10 \(\mathrm{\,pb}^{-1}\), is explored in this section. The dataset used is the \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi X\) and the reconstructed \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) candidates were selected based on the event selection described in Section 4.1. The \(B^{+}\) mass fit method described previously was then used to extract the efficiencies in bins of \(p_{T}\)\(\,\) as well as the total efficiency.

The differential cross-section \(\mathrm{d}\sigma/\mathrm{d}\,p_{T}\) can be obtained from:

\[\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma(B^{+})}{\mathrm{d}\,p_{T}}=\frac{N_{\rm sig}}{\Delta p _{T}\cdot\mathcal{L}\cdot\mathcal{A}\cdot\mathrm{BR}} \tag{5}\]

where \(N_{\rm sig}\) is the number of reconstructed \(B^{+}\) mesons obtained from the mass fit. The size of the \(p_{T}\) bin is denoted with \(\Delta p_{T}\). Furthermore, \(\mathcal{L}\) is the total luminosity and \(\mathcal{A}\) the overall efficiency. The

Figure 2: Invariant mass \(M(K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\) distribution with the \(B^{+}\) mass peak for signal (red) and combinatorial \(b\bar{b}\) -background (blue).

branching ratio BR is the product of the world average [5] branching ratios of \({\rm BR}(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+})=(10.0\pm 1.0)\times 10^{-4}\) and \({\rm BR}(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-})=(5.88\pm 0.10)\times 10^{-2}\). The invariant mass spectra of the \(B^{+}\) candidates are fitted in each \(p_{T}\) range using an extended unbinned maximum likelihood fit. The probability density function is a Gaussian for the signal and a linear function for the background region:

\[L=\frac{N_{\rm sig}}{N_{\rm total}}\cdot f_{\rm sig}+\frac{N_{\rm total}-N_{\rm sig }}{N_{\rm total}}\cdot f_{\rm bkg} \tag{6}\]

where \(f_{\rm sig}\) and \(f_{\rm bkg}\) are the fit functions as described in Equation 4. For this fit, the \(B^{+}\) mass has been fixed to the value obtained from the mass fit in the previous Section 4.2, \(m=5279.3\)\(\rm\ MeV\). The results for the overall efficiencies and the mass widths of the fits, for the individual \(p_{T}\) bins, are summarized in Table 3. The mass fits in the various \(p_{T}\) regions are presented in Figure 4 whereas the fit over the full \(p_{T}\) range is shown in Fig. 3.

To measure the \(B^{+}\) total cross-section a similar procedure to the one used for the calculation of the differential cross-section is followed, but in this case all \(B^{+}\) with \(p_{T}>10\) GeV are used to calculate the total efficiency \(\cal A\). The \(B^{+}\) mass distribution is shown in Fig. 3. The results of the total efficiency and the mass width from the fit, for the \(B^{+}\) total cross-section measurement, are presented in Table 4.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|} \hline \multicolumn{2}{|c|}{total cross-section} \\ \hline \hline \(\cal A\) [\%] & 29.8\(\pm\)0.8 \\ \hline \(\sigma(B^{+})\) [\(\rm\ MeV\)] & 42.2\(\pm\)1.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}

### Lifetime measurement

The measurement of the lifetime \(\tau\) of the selected \(B^{+}\) candidates is a sensitive tool to confirm the beauty contents in a sample, in particular the number of the reconstructed \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) decays obtained in the \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi X\) dataset. The proper decay time is defined as \(t=\lambda/c\). For this analysis, no cut on the proper decay length \(\lambda\) (Equation 2) of the \(J/\psi\) candidate or the \(B^{+}\) candidate should be applied.

The proper decay time distribution in the signal region \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) can be parametrised as a convolution of an exponential function with a Gaussian resolution function, while the background distribution parametrisation consists of two different exponential functions, where each is convoluted with a Gaussian resolution function. In the \(b\bar{b}\to J/\psi X\) no additional zero lifetime events are expected because there are no prompt \(J/\psi\) produced. In the realistic case, where zero lifetime events will be present, an extra Gaussian centered at zero is needed in order to properly describe those events. With the model used here, the Gaussian resolution functions depend on the reconstructed uncertainties on an event-by-event basis. In addition, it is assumed, that the distribution of the uncertainties per event are different for the signal and the corresponding background probability density functions (pdf) [13]. The use of conditional pdfs was required in order to take into account the proper decay time error per event. The exponential part of the lifetime distribution has the usual form:

\[F_{t}(t)=e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}, \tag{7}\]where \(t\) is the proper decay time and \(\tau\) is the lifetime. Accordingly, the convoluted function is then

\[F_{c}(t)=e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}\otimes G(t,\mu,s\cdot\sigma_{i}), \tag{8}\]

where \(\mu\) is the mean value of the Gaussian resolution function which parametrises the average bias in each proper decay time measurement. The scale factor of the error is \(s\) and \(\sigma_{i}\) is the per event proper decay time error. The conditional pdf on the per event uncertainty is then:

\[F_{t}(t)=F_{c}(t|\sigma_{i})\cdot P(\sigma_{i}), \tag{9}\]

where \(P(\sigma_{i})\) is the distribution of the proper decay time error. The distribution of the proper decay time uncertainty is approximated by a superposition of Gaussian functions. In order to separate between the signal and the background, the proper decay time pdf is multiplied with the \(B^{+}\) mass pdf, described in Section 4.2. A two-dimensional fit to the \(B^{+}\) proper decay time and \(B^{+}\) mass is then performed.

The results of the lifetime fit are presented in Table 5 and shown in Figure 5. The background can be best described with the two lifetime components (\(\tau_{1}\) and \(\tau_{2}\)) which are also shown in Table 5. For the events in the mass region of the signal within \(M(B^{+})\in[5.15,5.8]\) GeV the proper decay time found from the decay length is compared to the generated \(B^{+}\) lifetime. The result of the comparison is shown in Fig. 5. The differences are well centered at zero with a Gaussian distribution and sigma 0.088 ps. It should be noted that the resolution as well as its \(\sigma\) in \(\eta\) bins of 0.25 is found to be independent of \(\eta\).

## 5 Statistical and Systematic Uncertainties

From the analysis presented above, the expected number of reconstructed \(B^{+}\) candidates amounts to 160 per pb\({}^{-1}\). This implies that sufficient statistics can be collected for a reliable cross-section measurement, after just a few months of data taking at the initial low luminosity phase of the LHC. This scenario is valid

Figure 5: \(B^{+}\) lifetime fit (left) with the signal (dashed red) and the background (dashed black) contributions shown separately and \(B^{+}\) lifetime resolution (right).

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l||c|} \hline Signal lifetime \(\tau\)\([\mathrm{ps}]\) & 1.637\(\pm\)0.036 \\ \hline \hline BG lifetime \(\tau_{1}\)\([\mathrm{ps}]\) & 1.320\(\pm\)0.24 \\ \hline BG lifetime \(\tau_{2}\)\([\mathrm{ps}]\) & 0.370\(\pm\)0.067 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 5: Results for the lifetime fit.

for a luminosity less than \(\mathcal{L}=10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), since the analysis was performed without pileup events and contains no special trigger requirements or prescaling other than a single muon with \(p_{T}^{\mu}>6\) GeV at level-1.

For the measurements presented in this note the main sources of systematic uncertainties are the same. The uncertainty from the luminosity in the initial phase is estimated to be 10 % and will be reduced to about 6.5 % after 0.3 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The uncertainty from the PDF's is estimated to be 3 %, while the scale uncertainty of the NLO calculations is about 5 %. Finally, the uncertainty originating from the muon identification is about 3 %. Assuming Gaussian distributions for the above mentioned uncertainties, the total systematic uncertainty of the signal varies from 9.2 % to 12 % and is dominated by the uncertainty in the luminosity.

Given that a statistical precision of \(\mathcal{O}(1\) %) will be reached with an integrated luminosity of 0.1 fb\({}^{-1}\), the contribution of the systematics will dominate the uncertainties of the first measurements. This is the case even for the differential cross-section measurement. Although the statistics in each \(p_{T}\) bin is limited, the total uncertainty is dominated by the systematic uncertainties in the branching ratio of the \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\) and in the luminosity, which are of the same order. For the exclusive cross-section measurement in the \(B^{+}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(J/\psi K^{+}\) channel, the relative uncertainties of the differential and total cross-sections are given in Table 6. Therein, the first row of the table contains the quadratic sum of the statistical uncertainty corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 0.01 fb\({}^{-1}\) and the uncertainty in the efficiency. The latter is based on the statistics of the Monte Carlo dataset used. The second row is calculated by adding in quadrature the above uncertainty to the systematic uncertainty of the luminosity and the branching ratio for every \(p_{T}\) bin.

For the high statistics \(p_{T}\) bins as well as for the total cross-section, the total relative uncertainty is dominated by systematic errors, originating mainly from the uncertainty in the luminosity, which is assumed to be 10 % for the initial phase, and the 10 % uncertainty in the branching ratio of \(B^{+}\to J/\psi K^{+}\). The effect of the assumed background shape on the measurements is estimated to be less than 1 %. Finally, the precision of the lifetime measurement, for the same integrated luminosity is 2.5 %, where no systematic effects are taken into account.

## 6 Summary and Conclusions

In this note, the \(B^{+}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(J/\psi K^{+}\) channel using an inclusive \(b\bar{b}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(J/\psi(\mu 6\mu 4)X\) dataset has been studied by developing the \(J/\psi\) selection methods and understanding their efficiencies. A method for measuring the \(B^{+}\) mass using a likelihood fit, in order to separate signal and background, is established. The \(B^{+}\) selection efficiency \(\mathcal{A}\), both in \(p_{T}\) bins and in the whole \(p_{T}\) region, needed for the calculation of the differential and total cross-sections from real data, is extracted with fit methods similar to those used in the \(B^{+}\) mass measurement case. Finally a likelihood fit, which takes into account the per-event primary vertex error, is performed for the measurement of the \(B^{+}\) lifetime.

The total \(B^{+}\)\(\rightarrow\)\(J/\psi K^{+}\) production cross-section can be measured with a statistical precision better than 5% with the first 10pb\({}^{-1}\) of data. The differential cross-section with precision of the order of 10%.

With the same statistics, adequate detector performance studies can be realised using the \(B^{+}\) mass and lifetime measurements.
