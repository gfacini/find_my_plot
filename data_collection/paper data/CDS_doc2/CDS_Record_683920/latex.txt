###### Abstract

This note describes the measurements taken in the Gamma Irradiation Facility (GIF) in the X5 test beam area at CERN to investigate the temperature dependence of the MDT drift gas (Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) - 90:10). Spectra were taken with an Americium-241 source during the aging studies. We analysed the effects of temperature changes on the pulse height spectrum.

## 1 Introduction

Performance deterioration of the MDT chambers during long-term LHC operation is a serious concern. This aging is due to changes in the cathode and anode surfaces, which directly affect the tube lifetime. Pollutants introduced by inadequate cleaning of the construction elements can accelerate the aging significantly. In order to evaluate this effect before the start of production a number of tubes are irradiated in the X5 GIF facility at CERN which houses a 740 GBq \({}^{137}\)Cs source, and pulse height spectra are taken at regular intervals. As the experimental zone is close to a large door, the temperature strongly varies in relative short time lapses. This translates into pulse height variations which affect the precision of the aging measurements but can also be exploited to directly study the temperature dependence of the pulse height.

## 2 Experimental setup

Six tubes of 150 cm length were installed in the X5 test beam area at CERN. They were placed in a vertical position on an aluminium support frame at a distance of 1 m in front of a \({}^{137}\)Cs source. Electronic cards for high voltage power supply were soldered on the bottom side of each tube. Preamplifier hybrids were mounted on the readout cards which were soldered to the other side. The shapers were implemented on an electronic module which was placed outside the area. A Faraday cage mounted on each tube end minimized noise and pick-up. The signals were digitized by a standard ADC module, and the gate was generated by the signal itself.

In order to accumulate the charge per unit wire length specified for the aging procedure (see [1]) in a reasonably short time, a 740 GBq \({}^{137}\)Cs source with a Pb absorber was used. Lead filters can be chosen to adjust the actual gamma rate. The source gives a rather flat spectrum up to 660 keV with peaks at 660 keV and at around 80 keV. Reference spectra for testing the tube performance were taken with a 37 MBq \({}^{241}\)Am source with a Molybdenum foil in front of it.

The gas mixture was Ar/CO\({}_{2}\) - 90:10 at 3 bar absolute pressure flowing at ten times the rate foreseen for ATLAS. The HV power supply was 3.4 kV during \({}^{137}\)Cs irradiation whichcorresponds to a gas gain of 6\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\), while it was 3 kV during spectra acquisition (gas gain 1.2\(\times\)10\({}^{4}\)).

## 3 Aging studies

Deterioration of the performance of the MDT yields a significant decrease of the signal. For a given reference spectrum this leads to a downward shift and deformation of the pulse height distribution.

### Reference spectra

The reference spectra are taken with the \({}^{241}\)Am source with a Mo foil. The spectra (see figure [1]) are calibrated using the expected peak positions at 17 keV (which arises from Molybdenum fluorescence X-rays) and 60 keV. In each histogram, the position of the two peaks and of the pedestal (which is the first peak in the spectrum) are determined by fitting them with a Gaussian function. For a cross check, spectra are acquired without the foil. The 17 keV peak does not show in these spectra, as expected. To determine the aging of the drift tubes it is necessary to take spectra at regular time intervals and to determine the relative change.

### Measurements

In order to measure the peak position as function of temperature one tube has been chosen. The spectra were taken using the \({}^{241}\)Am source with Mo foil during one morning exploiting the daily thermal excursion as varying environmental conditions.

In the first cycle of measurements the temperature was monitored by a digital thermometer of sensitivity \(\pm 0.1^{\circ}\) C placed at the entrance of the experimental area while in the second cycle the thermometer was placed onto the support near the tubes. Therefore the two data sets must be analysed separately. We have determined the peak position of the 60 keV peak as described in Section 3.1. By plotting \(\log\left[A(T)/A(T_{0})\right]\) against \(\log\left[T/T_{0}\right]\) and performing a linear fit we were able to derive a value for the Diethorn parameter \(\Delta V\). Taking into account a systematic error of \(\pm 3\) channels due to fluctuations of the fitted ADC pedestal we obtain \(\Delta V=(35\pm 2)\) V in the first case (thermometer near entrance) and \(\Delta V=(39\pm 1)\) V in the second (thermometer near tubes). As a cross check, the same analysis is done with the 17 keV peak yielding compatible values. Figure [2] displays the results.

## 5 Conclusions

The extracted Diethorn parameter \(\Delta\)V agrees well with the one determined from the high voltage dependence [2], and the small difference between the values obtained by two different methods gives us further confidence that the dependence of the MDT gas gain on external parameters is well understood. To reduce the remaining systematics it would be desirable to repeat these simple measurements with a direct measurement of the gas

temperature. For the operation of the ATLAS chambers, however, the present results are more consequential.
