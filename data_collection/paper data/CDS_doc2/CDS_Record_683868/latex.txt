In beam tests several algorithms to reconstruct the energy of pions were tried. In this study two of them: the _Sampling_-dependent weighting technique and the _H1_ based approach were tuned to determine the jet energy in the ATLAS calorimeters. The reported results were obtained analysing the full simulated back to back di-jet events produced by quarks having an energy, \(E_{0}\), equal to 20, 50, 200 and 1000 \(GeV\) and \(|\eta|\) equal to 0.3. The calorimeter cell electronic noise and the digital filter in the electromagnetic calorimeter response were simulated. For the moment, pile-up effects were not taken into account. The _H1_ method produced better results. The non-linearity effects are smaller than 2%. For a cone size \(\Delta R=0.7\), the fractional energy resolution obtained is given by \(\sigma\big{/}E=51.5\%\big{/}\sqrt{E}\ \oplus 1.54\%\).

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

For each quark energy, the values of the \(L\) calibration constants, \(a_{l}\)'s, correspond to the minimum of the width of the total reconstructed energy. They were obtained minimising the quantity:

\[\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left(E_{rec}^{k}-E_{kin}^{k}\right)^{2}+\alpha\sum_{k=1}^{K}\left( E_{rec}^{k}-E_{kin}^{k}\right)\qquad(2)\]

with respect to the \(a_{l}\)'s and the Lagrange parameter \(\alpha\) in order to constraint the mean value of \(E_{rec}^{k}\) to reproduce \(\left\langle E_{kin}^{k}\right\rangle\).

_Step 2_

Since in the real experiment the energy of the particles associated to a jet is unknown the \(a_{l}\)'s, obtained in step 1, were expressed as smooth functions of \(E_{kin}^{k}\):

\[a_{I}=g_{I}\left(b_{I}^{n};E_{kin}^{k}\right)\qquad n=1,...,N\;\;.\qquad(3)\]

The parameters \(b_{n}\)'s were got fitting equations (3) to the \(a_{l}\)'s values obtained assuming \(E_{kin}^{k}\) known and the following iteration procedure was applied:

1. a starting value for the reconstructed energy was defined. The results are not critical to this value and in the analysis \(E_{start}^{k}=\sum E_{cell}\) was used;
2. the parameters \(a_{l}\)'s were determined using equations (3) and the new reconstructed energy using equation (1);
3. the weights were re-computed using the energy reconstructed in (b);
4. the procedure was iterated until the change in the reconstructed energy is smaller than 1 \(MeV\); typically less than ten iterations are needed.

With the aim to have a minimum number of parameters, two calibration strategies were applied to the simulated data: the _Sampling_ method and the _H1_ method [4].

**The _Sampling_ method**

In the _Sampling_ method, the reconstructed energy of the jet \(k\), \(E_{rec}^{k}\), was expressed as a linear combination of the energies deposited in the longitudinal calorimeter samplings \(i\), \(E_{i}^{k}\), see table 2:

\[E_{rec}^{k}=a_{1}E_{1}^{k}+a_{11}E_{11}^{k}+a_{12}E_{12}^{k}+a_{10}E_{10}^{k} \;\;.\qquad(4)\]

The energy deposited in the cryostat, \(E_{10}^{k}\), was parameterised according to:\[E_{10}^{k}=\sqrt{E_{4}^{k}\times E_{5}^{k}}\ \.\ \ \ \ \ \ (5)\]

The values of the parameters obtained minimising the equation (2) in the case of \(\Delta R=0.7\) are reported in table 3. The fractional energy resolutions, calculated as the width of the distribution \(E_{rec}^{k}-E_{kin}^{k}\) divided by the mean value of the reconstructed energy, are reported in table 4. These values, and the others that will follow, were obtained fitting a gaussian function all over the full variable domain.

As one can see in table 4, the results do not improve significantly using an eight-parameter function:

\[E_{rec}^{k}=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{7}a_{i}E_{i}^{k}+a_{10}E_{10}^{k}\.\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (6)\]

This result is due to the fact that, as shown in table 5, the values of the weighting parameters for the three samplings of the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeter are close. The errors in tables 3 and 5 are the RMS values of 5 independent determinations of the \(a_{i}\)'s obtained by breaking the data samples at each energy in five separate sets of equal statistics and solving the minimisation equation for each set. Similar results were found using \(\Delta R=0.4\).

**Description of the \(H\!I\) method**

The \(H\!I\) method is based on the study of the energy deposited by the jet particles in the individual cells of the calorimeters. As an example, figure 1 shows the cell energy distributions in the case of \(E_{0}=200\)\(GeV\) and \(\Delta R=0.7\). In the case of the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, the response of the cells with a small signal is corrected upwards to equalise their response to those of cells with larger (typically electromagnetic) deposited energy. The expression of the reconstructed energy contains 5 parameters:

\[E_{rec}^{\,k}=E_{1}^{\,k}+\sum_{i=11}^{12}\,\sum_{j}\left[f_{i}\times E_{cell} \left(j\right)\stackrel{{ k}}{{i}}\right]+a_{10}E_{10}^{\,k} \tag{7}\]

with:

\[f_{i}=a^{1}{}_{i}+\frac{a^{2}{}_{i}}{\left|E_{cell}\left(j\right)\stackrel{{ k}}{{i}}\right|}, \tag{8}\]

where \(i\) is the sampling of the cell \(j\) and \(E_{10}^{\,k}\) is defined in equation (5).

Figure 1: Energy deposited by particles produced by 200 \(GeV\) quarks in the cells a) of the presampler, b), c), d) of the electromagnetic calorimeter samplings, and e), f) and g) of the hadronic calorimeter samplings. The cone radius is \(\Delta R=0.7\).

How equation (7) was obtained is described in the following. We first divided each distribution of the energies deposited in the cells of the presampler, of the electromagnetic calorimeter samplings and of the hadronic calorimeter samplings in 10 bins of equal statistics (\(j=1\),..., 10). The function used to parameterise the energy response was:

\[E_{rec}^{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{7}\sum_{j=1}^{10}\left[a_{i}^{j}\times E_{i,j}^{k} \right]+a_{10}E_{10}^{k}\]

where \(E_{i,j}^{k}\) is the sum of the cell energies lying in the bin \(j\).

Figures 2-5 show the values of the quantities \(\left\{a_{i}^{j},j=1,...,10\right\}\) obtained in the minimisation of equation (2) using \(\Delta R=0.7\) for \(E_{0}\) equal to 20, 50, 200 and 1000 \(GeV\) respectively. Similar distributions were obtained in the case of \(\Delta R=0.4\). The errors are the RMS values of 5 independent determinations of the parameters obtained by breaking the data samples at each energy in five separate sets of equal statistics and solving the minimisation equation for each set.

### Parameterisation B

The solid lines in figures 2-5 represent the results obtained fitting the function (8) to the data. The good \(\chi^{2}\) value suggested the use of the parameterisation:

\[E_{rec}^{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{7}\sum_{j}\left[f_{i}\times E_{cell}\left(j\right)_{i} ^{k}\right]+a_{10}E_{10}^{k}. \tag{9}\]

The values of the parameters obtained minimising equation (2) are summarised in table 6 in the case of \(\Delta R=0.7\). The corresponding shapes are superimposed to the data of figures 2-5 (dashed lines). One can see that there is a good agreement between the values obtained in the fit and in the minimisation of equation (2). Similar results were obtained in the case of \(\Delta R=0.4\).

### Parameterisation C

Table 6 shows that many of the parameters are compatible inside the errors and in particular those of samplings belonging to the same calorimeter. We decided then to group them together and the expression of the corrected energy became:

\[E_{rec}^{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{10}\left[a_{1}^{j}\,E_{1,j}^{k}+a_{11}^{j}\,E_{11,j}^{ k}+a_{12}^{j}\,E_{12,j}^{k}\right]+a_{10}E_{10}^{k}\.\]

Figures 6-9 show the values of the quantities \(a_{i}^{j}\), \(i\)=1, 11,12 obtained in the minimisation, for \(E_{0}\) equal to 20, 50, 200 and 1000 \(GeV\) respectively. The value of the cone radius is \(\Delta R=0.7\).

### Resolution results

The energy resolutions obtained using the parameterisations \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), and \(D\) in the minimisation of equation (2) are reported in table 9 for \(\Delta R=0.4\) and in table 10 for \(\Delta R=0.7\). Reducing the number of parameters from 71 to 5, the resolutions grow worse, at maximum, of 13%.

### Parameterisation with the beam energy of the \(a_{l}\)'s

In the second step of the procedure, the parameters \(a_{l}\)'s, obtained using the value of the energy of the particles associated to the jet with the parameterisations (4) and (7), were expressed as smooth parametric functions of \(E_{kin}^{\,k}\). In tables 11-14, we report these functions

**Results about resolution and linearity**

The _H1_ method produced better results than the _Sampling_ one. The jet fractional energy resolutions are reported in table 15. Using the _Sampling_ method, the iteration procedure allowed to get slightly better results essentially at \(E_{0}=20\)_GeV_, compared to the case in which the knowledge of \(E_{kin}^{k}\) was used. In the case of the _H1_ method, we found a slightly worsening of the resolutions except for the point at \(E_{0}=20\)_GeV_ and \(\Delta R=0.4\). Enlarging the cone size does not improve significantly the energy resolution due to the increase of the electronic noise, except for the low energy 20_GeV_ point. The non-linearity effects produced by the method are summarised in table 16. The normalised response is given by \(\mu=\left\langle E^{k}\middle/E_{kin}^{k}\right\rangle\). The values are less than 3% and 2% using the _Sampling_ and the _H1_ method respectively. The results could be improved by taking into account the correlation's existing between the \(a_{l}\)' when one parameterises them as a function of the energy.

The energy resolution values, shown in figure 10, were parameterised according to:

\[\frac{\Delta E}{E}=\frac{a}{\sqrt{E}}\oplus b. \tag{11}\]

Table 17 summarises the parameter values obtained in the fits with the \(\chi^{2}\) probabilities for the two cone sizes and the two calibration methods. The corresponding shapes are superimposed to the data in figure 14. The bad \(\chi^{2}\) values in the case of the _Sampling_ method come from the \(E_{o}=20\)\(GeV\) point. A more accurate analysis is necessary to understand this result. The data do not support the existence of a noise term \(\propto 1/E\) in the resolution parameterisation.

#### 4.2.2 Jets at high \(\mathbf{p_{T}}\)

Jets available in ATLAS for in-situ calibration of the barrel region will have energies up to about 500 \(GeV\). It will be then necessary to extrapolate the calibration to higher energies. To do that we applied the weighting technique discussed in the previous sections.

The parameters \(b_{n}\)'s describing the energy dependence of the calibration coefficients, equation (3), were obtained fitting the functions of tables 11-14 to the \(a_{l}\)'s values obtained for \(E_{0}\) equal to 20, 50 and 200 \(GeV\). The 1000 \(GeV\) jets were then reconstructed using these functions. The \(H1\) method with \(\Delta R=0.7\) gave a fractional energy resolution of \(\left(2.2\pm 0.1\right)\%\) and a non-linearity of \(\left(2.9\pm 0.1\right)\%\). These values are very close to those reported in tables 15 and 16 obtained using the four jet energy points in the determination of the \(b_{n}\)'s.

In summary, we have seen that the jet energy can be determined without prior knowledge of the particle energy of the jet by using simple smooth functions to describe the energy dependence of the calibration coefficients. A total of seven parameters are used for the _H1_ method and six (five) for the _Sampling_ method and \(\Delta R=0.4\) (\(\Delta R=0.7\)). Essentially the same performances for the energy resolution are obtained, as when the coefficients are fitted at each energy points. The _H1_ method produced better results both in the resolution and residual non-linearity. The study confirms the performances of the ATLAS calorimeters obtained in the test beams with pions [5-8].
