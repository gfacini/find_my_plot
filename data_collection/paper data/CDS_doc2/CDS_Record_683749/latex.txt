[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:1]

In order to maximize the sensitivity of the EMMI, both the sinusoidal current amplitude and frequency have to be as large as possible.

The amplitude is limited however to approximately 100 mA if the wire temperature should not rise by more than 10 degrees2.

Footnote 2: Measurements on the wire temperature rise were performed with a 1 m long MDT in still air. The temperature was measured at thermal equilibrium.

The sinusoidal current circulating on the wire induces currents in the tube but these systematic effects were found to be negligeable for frequencies lower than 500 Hz3.

## 3 The coils and the preamplifier

The sensors used are multi-winding air-coils. Assuming \(i_{0}\) = 75 mA, \(\nu\) = 235 Hz, rectangular coils (single winding) of size 10 x 2 cm\({}^{2}\) positioned at an average distance of 3.5 cm from the wire, the expected signal given by equation (3) is

\[\Delta{\cal E}=79.3\ \mathrm{pV/winding/\mu m}\ \mathrm{of\ wire\ offset\ from\ endoplasmic\ center}. \tag{4}\]

This signal is very small, but increases linearly with the number of windings per coils. However, the preamplifier noise figure limits the maximum signal-to-noise ratio that can be reached. The first preamplifier stage uses the very low noise instrumentation amplifier INA 103 from Burr-Brown, that provides the best noise performance for source resistances of the order of 200 ohms. With a 330 \(\mu\)m copper wire on a \(10\times 2\,\mathrm{cm}^{2}\) plexiglass core, this value is reached with 1600 windings, giving a signal of 127 nV/\(\mu\)m.

The preamplifier first stage provides a \(\times 1000\) gain. It is followed by a filter with a passband of 170 to 1700 Hz and by a 50 Hz notch. A x8 gain amplifier, a filter equivalent to the previous one and a 100 Hz notch complete the amplification box.

The total gain at the working frequency5 (235 Hz) is 69.75 dB.

Footnote 5: The working frequency was choosed to be lower than 500 Hz and not a multiple of 50 Hz.

## 4 Signal extraction

In order to measure the \(\Delta{\cal F}\) (phase and amplitude) a lock-in amplifier has been used. This technique allows the extraction of a signal from a large background when there is fixed phase relation between the unknown signal and the modulating oscillator.

The measurement time depends on the signal-to-noise ratio, and for the system described in this memo is below one second per point.

## 5 Test setup

The prototype of the EMMI is shown in figure 2. Two air coils were positioned on the two sides of the tube at an average distance of 3.5 cm from the wire, 5 cm away from the endplug.

The tube was held in place by means of two diamagnetic V's mounted on two micrometric slides, used to position it symmetrically between the coils.

The wire was connected to a function generator [2] providing the 235 Hz sinusoidal modulation via a 50 ohm resistor. The signal available at the resistor ends was used to monitor the current circulating on the MDT wire.

The differential output from the coils was preamplified and sent to a quadrature lock-in amplifier [3] providing a measurement of both signal amplitude and phase.

## 6 Measurements and results

The EMMI was tested using 30 cm long MDT's especially built with the wire displaced from the endplug center by fixed quantities, from 5 \(\mu\)m up to 100 \(\mu\)m, and parallel to the tube axis (with some exceptions, see below).

Each tube had eight 3 mm diameter holes at both ends, one every 45\({}^{\circ}\), a few centimeters away from the endplug. These holes allow an independent measurement of the wire position by means of a microscope5.

Footnote 5: The microscope has a single point resolution of the order of one micron.

The correlation between microscope and EMMI measurements is shown in figures 3 and 4. Different kind of tubes were measured:

Standard tubes;

Plastic tubes;

Standard tubes with tilted wires6;

Footnote 6: In these tubes, the wire forms an angle with respect to the tube axis up to half a mrad.

Footnote 7: These last tubes were obtained by partially immersing the tube in a 10% solution of sodium hydroxide. Each tube was closed at both ends to preserve the inner surface. In addition half of the surface - the part above the solution level - was covered with a silicon-based vacuum grease, to protect it from corrosive vapors. Corrosion rates of \(\sim 60\)\(\mu\)m/h were obtained. Tubes with thickness variations as large as 100 \(\mu\)m were built.

Standard tubes with azimuthal thickness variations8.

Footnote 8: The microscope has a single point resolution of the order of one micron.

The displacement of the points from the fit gives a measure of the system resolution, found to be approximately 2 \(\mu\)m. There is no apparent difference in behaviour between the different kind of tubes, suggesting that the wire position measurement is independent on tube effects.

Conclusions

A system able to measure the wire position inside an MDT drift tube with respect to the endplug outer surface has been built and found to be able to reconstruct wire offsets with an accuracy of 2 \(\mu\)m.

A measurement time of less than 1 second per point permits a full MDT check (both ends) in a time scale of the order of a minute.

More detailed studies on the electromagnetic micrometer will be presented in [1].
