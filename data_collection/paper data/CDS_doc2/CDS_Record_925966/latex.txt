## 1 Introduction

The Tile calorimeter (Tilecal) [1] is a hadronic calorimeter in the ATLAS detector. Due to its fast response and good granularity, Tilecal also contributes to the first level trigger (LVL-1) with the analog signal.

The Trigger Summing Board, a high-performance active analog adder, is part of the Tilecal front-end electronics and provides the trigger tower signal for the LVL-1 trigger system in ATLAS. The low-gain signal from the 3-in-1 card enters the adder board, which provides two kinds of fast analog signal: trigger tower sum (total energy in the \(\eta\times\phi=0.1\times 0.1\) bins) for the calorimeter trigger and muon output (amplified signal from individual PMTs of the last radial sampling) to assist in tagging muons.

This paper describes the last modification on the adder board implemented to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the muon output and shows the adder board performance during several testbeam periods. In the next section, the adder board modification is described. Section 3 discusses the results obtained from beam tests performed at CERN and some conclusions are derived in Section 4.

## 2 Production Adder Board

The summing system provides two differential output signals, both capable to drive 50 \(\Omega\) loads, as required for signal transmission from the calorimeter up toup to six input signals (sum output) and forms the trigger tower signal. The other output provides the signal from the third sampling layer of the calorimeter (muon output), which is used for triggering muons.

The adder input channels are matched to 50 \(\Omega\). Input signals are furnished by the photomultiplier tubes (PMT) after signal shaping that is performed by the 3-in-1 cards [2].

The principle used in the adder design is to convert the input voltage signals into currents through transconductance amplifiers, add these currents and provide the required driving capability through a differential output stage. The signal path is kept fully differential within the trigger summing system to minimize sensitivity to induced common-mode noise.

The block diagram of the circuit can be seen in Figure 1. The input wide-band transconductance amplifiers (WTA) match the input impedances and preventing inter-channel crosstalk. They are implemented by fast commercial differential transconductance amplifiers, which provide an output current proportional to the input voltage. The differential output currents of each channel are summed at nodes A and B and converted to voltage by means of the resistors. The output stage is implemented as a classical instrumentation amplifier [3], driving differentially the LVL-1 signal output. The muon signal is produced through identical but independent input and output stages, so that the signal from the third sampling layer of the calorimeter can also drive a 50 \(\Omega\) load.

The adder board design can be seen in more detail in Ref. [4]. In this paper we will focus on the last modification which improves the muon output signal-to-noise ratio.

Figure 1: The block diagram of the trigger summing system.

The adder design approach enables a change of the muon gain without affecting the sum output, as the muon signal path has independent input and output stages. To increase this gain, the design was modified as shown in Figure 2, setting \(Z_{\mathrm{T}}=15\ \Omega\) in the input stage and \(R_{2}=243\ \Omega\) in the output stage, instead of \(Z_{\mathrm{T}}=243\ \Omega\) and \(R_{2}=1\ \mathrm{k}\Omega\). The muon output voltage gain \(V_{\mathrm{OUT}}\) is inversely proportional to \(Z_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(R_{2}\) as can be seen in Eq. (1), where \(K\) is the parameter of the transconductance amplifier MAX435 [5]. The calibration of the muon output was set to 280 mV/pC to keep the circuit bandwidth around 8 MHz. It is important to stress that the increase in gain is followed by a decrease of bandwidth, therefore, the circuit's integrated noise also decreases (considering white noise) and the signal noise ratio of the muon output can be improved.

\[\frac{V_{\mathrm{OUT}}}{V_{\mathrm{IN}}}\approx K\times\frac{2\times 68\ \Omega}{Z_{\mathrm{T}}}\times\left(\frac{2\times 1000 \ \Omega}{R_{2}}+1\right) \tag{1}\]

The adder board schematics of the production boards can be seen in Figure 3.

## 3 Testbeam Performance

The analog signal was tested in several testbeam periods (2001 - 2003) using different adder boards and several readout techniques.

In 2001, the older adder boards were used and the signal was read using charge integrating ADC units. The details of the setup as well as the performance results are given in Ref. [4].

Since 2002, the improved adder boards have been implemented into the Tilecal electronics drawers. At the same time, the readout chain was improved taking into account the experience gained in previous testbeam periods [4]. The readout was organized as follows:

Figure 2: Muon output simplified schematics with the new values for \(Z_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(R_{2}\).

Figure 3: Production adder board schematic.

* Trigger cables delivered the differential output signal to the control room. Three cable types (differing in the length, impedance, shielding etc) were tested.
* The differential signal was transformed to a unipolar one exclusively by a special custom-made passive transformer (gain \(1/\sqrt{2}\)). The transformer showed better performance (in terms of signal-to-noise ratio) than the active receiver in previous testbeam periods.
* Finally the signal was sampled each 25 ns using the special fast ADC. This allows pulse shape reconstruction, which in turn enables a more sophisticated data treatment.

In order to further improve the signal-to-noise ratio in the muon output, the HV settings policy changed in the short cells of the last radial compartment, the so-called D-sampling3. The gain in these cells is set 20% higher to improve the signal-to-noise ratio for muons in the analog output (see also Ref. [4]). Note that the muon signal from these cells is much smaller compared to that from extended barrel D-cells because of different muon path lengths in these cells. Two factors contribute:

Footnote 3: The short cells consist of only two tiles (10, 11) in the radial direction. The cells concerned are all barrel module D-cells and D-4 in extended barrel modules. See e.g. Ref. [1] for the cell layout.

* different radial size of the D-sampling in barrel and extended barrel (almost a factor of 2)
* track length for projective particles increases with the pseudo-rapidity (another factor of 1.5 between \(\eta=0.35\) and \(\eta=1.05\))

### Data Treatment

As already mentioned, the readout technique enables the reconstruction of the analog adder pulse shape directly from the testbeam data. Since signals from the PMT pass through the 3-in-1 card shaper circuit, signals exhibit the same width (FWHM) on the output. Therefore, the total charge is proportional to the resulting signal amplitude and one can in turn apply the pulse shape fit on individual events to determine the energy [6, 7].

#### 3.1.1 Adder Pulse Shapes

Since the pulse shapes differ for different event sources [8], the procedure was applied separately for beam triggers, charge injection (CIS) and laser triggers.

The pulse shape reconstruction for CIS triggers is rather straightforward - the phase of the charge injection with respect to 40 MHz clock is known for every event and the phase is varied during the special CIS runs. Thus, one gets the pulse shape by superimposing individual samples (spaced by 25 ns) of each event taking into account the phase for the given event. On the other hand, the CIS triggers involve a small leakage pulse [8] that does not scale with applied charge and has to be carefully determined from empty CIS events.

Since the timing of the adder tower sum inputs is optimized for physics events in projective geometry [9], the output CIS pulse shape depends on the actual CIS timing settings4. Therefore, the CIS pulse shapes were determined only for the muon output. It turns out that the pulse shapes slightly depend on the cable used5 as demonstrated in Fig. 4. Whereas the pulse shapes for LAr and Tilecal new cables coincide (FWHM = 75 ns) as expected, the old cables (used in previous testbeams and in 2002) exhibit narrower pulse shapes (FWHM = 64 ns).

Footnote 4: The CIS timing can be set for groups of 6 channels, but these groups are different from inputs in the respective trigger tower sum.

Footnote 5: The old cables (50 m long, attenuation 35%, impedance 120 \(\Omega\)) were used in previous testbeams and in 2002. The other two kinds of cables were manufactured by Nexans (70 m long, impedance approximately 100 \(\Omega\)): the LAr cable (attenuation 40%) used in 2002 and the new Tilecal cables (attenuation 35%) used during the 2003 testbeams.

The pulse shapes for physics and laser events were determined in a very similar way. The only difference is that beam particles and laser events arrive to the calorimeter with a random phase, that has to be determined. The time as reconstructed from the digitized data has been used for this purpose. Whereas the laser pulse shape coincides with that of CIS (muon output only), the physics pulse shapes are approximately by 10% wider. A comparison of the new cable pulse shapes is given in Fig. 5. The FWHMs are 80 ns (muon output, physics triggers), 75 ns (muon output, CIS) and 69 ns (tower sum, physics triggers). It should be noted that similar differences between the individual pulse shapes are observed in the digital readout system [8].

For each kind of trigger, the analog pulse shapes were determined for several

channels. The channel-to-channel variations are negligible and thus unique pulse shapes are used for all channels.

The reconstructed pulse shapes are also compared to those acquired using a digital oscilloscope. Although the scope data were taken later during the commissioning phase in the ATLAS underground area, the read-out chain was very similar to that used in the beam tests. The comparison for the muon output total CIS pulse shape is shown in Fig. 6. The difference in shape between this total CIS pulse shape and those shown in Fig. 4 is due to the underlying leakage pulse in Fig. 6. Note that the scope data come from one channel and only few triggers were accumulated, that's why one can still see small periodic structure6 on the tail of the CIS pulse. The pulse shapes coincide very well.

Footnote 6: This structure is most probably due to the external 40 MHz noise.

#### 3.1.2 Fit Method

Once the pulse shapes are determined, the signal parameters (phase, pedestal, amplitude) are obtained by applying the respective pulse shape fit to individual 25 ns samples for each event. Two examples are shown in Fig. 7.

All results given in the Sections 3.2 and 3.3 have been obtained using the above mentioned fit method that reconstructs the original pulse shape and thus allows for precise determination of the phase and the amplitude.

### Results for the Adder Tower Sum

Several features have been studied for the adder tower sum signal - calibration, energy linearity and resolution and finally also the timing issue has been investigated.

The tower sum calibration has been studied with high energy pion beams

Figure 5: The comparison of tower sum (physics only) and muon output pulse shapes as measured with the new trigger cables made by Nexans.

Figure 6: The comparison of the pulse shape reconstructed from testbeam data (open circles) and acquired using the digital oscilloscope (dotted line). The plot shows the total CIS pulse in the adder muon output for an injected charge of 2 pC. The CIS signal includes an underlaying leakage pulse associated with the capacitance of the switch, in addition to the charge on the 5 pF capacitor.

Figure 7: Examples of two pulse shape fits to individual events demonstrating the fit method performance: a tower sum physics event (left plot) and a muon output CIS event (right plot). The dashed line on the right plot shows the underlying leakage pulse (note that the applied charge is only 1.3 pC). The fit parameters are the phase (\(P1\)), pedestal (\(P2\)) and amplitude (\(P3\)).

(180 GeV). The calibration constants are obtained as slopes of the amplitude vs. the digitized signal over the whole pion signal spectrum in the calorimeter. This procedure is repeated for 33 tower sum channels, the results are shown in Fig. 8 (2003 testbeam periods).

Taking into account the signal attenuation in the cables used in 2003 testbeams, the transformer gain and the independently measured fast ADC calibration, one can determine the original gain of the adder tower sum circuit:

\[G(\mathrm{tower})=0.95\ \mathrm{counts/pC}\times\frac{1}{0.65}\times\sqrt{2} \times 4.9\ \mathrm{mV/count}=10.1\ \mathrm{mV/pC} \tag{2}\]

This is in perfect agreement with the designed and laboratory-measured gain [4].

Although the analog calorimeter signal is used only for fast energy estimates, the linearity of the energy measurement is important e.g. for good missing \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) estimates at the LVL-1. The linearity of the tower sum signal has been investigated with respect to the digitized energy. Results from several beam energies have been superimposed in this study, thus exploring the range up to almost 300 GeV. The results are shown in Fig. 9 for two different tower sum signals. The linearity is better than 1% for energies above 65 GeV. Larger fluctuations at very small energies (below 10 GeV) may indicate still unresolved issues of the fit method for very small signals. On the other hand, the effect does not exceed 5%.

Another issue is the energy resolution. Since the analog signal is noisier, one expects an additional noise term contributes to the standard calorimetry resolution as determined with the digitized signal. In order to evaluate this additional noise term, the difference of the analog (\(E(\mathrm{analog})\)) and digitized (\(E(\mathrm{digi})\)) signal from PMTs belonging to the given tower is used. The fractional

resolution (Gaussian sigma of \(E({\rm analog})-E({\rm digi})\) over \(E({\rm digi})\)) is displayed on Fig. 10 as a function of digitized energy.

The spread of \(E({\rm analog})-E({\rm digi})\) is not fully energy independent, which could be caused e.g. by the fact that the sum of individual digitized energies is almost always represented by a mixture of high and low-gain signals from the respective PMTs, whereas the analog sum is built of low-gain signals only. Possible small differences in the individual low-gain calibration (corrected with CIS for digitized signal, but not for the analog sum) may also cause such effect. Anyway, the energy resolution in the analog system is better than an additional constant term of 1% (to be added in quadrature to the standard energy resolution) for high energies. It should also be noted that the spread of the analog signal for empty (pedestal) events amounts to approximately 0.5 GeV, which corresponds very well to the spread found at very low energies.

Since the trigger tower sum is formed as a sum of 4 - 6 PMTs from different radial compartments, the timing of the individual inputs represents another important issue. As already mentioned above, the timing is optimized for particles in projective geometry. Therefore, the signals from individual PMTs should arrive to the adder input within few ns. This feature is checked using particles penetrating different depths in the calorimeter7, where the main signal contribution comes from different PMTs [10]. Electrons of 100 GeV deposit most of their energy in the first radial compartment, while showers of 180 GeV pions are longer and thus the signal contribution from the second compartment is important. The timing of the total signal is mostly determined by the PMTs with the largest signal.

Figure 9: The linearity of the tower sum signal for 2 different adders: \(\eta=-0.25\) (left plot) and \(\eta=-0.35\) (right plot). All values are within \(\pm 5\%\), the linearity is better than 1% above 65 GeV.

The mean time \(\Delta T\) between the moment when a particle crosses the test-beam trigger scintillator (S3) and the peak of the adder tower sum signal is shown in Fig. 11 as a function of \(\eta\). The reconstructed time exhibits a RMS spread of 1 ns for each pseudo-rapidity point. The results show a good time alignment in all towers - the differences in reconstructed time between the two types of beams are smaller than 0.5 ns in all cases, RMS being 0.2 ns. The differences in \(\Delta T\) between individual towers don't represent any problem, since compensating delays will be added in the LVL-1 pre-processor unit.

### Results for the Adder Muon Output

The role of the muon output signal is to assist in muon tagging. The important features are therefore the calibration and the signal-to-noise ratio \(S/N\) (the amplitude of the most probable muon signal over the noise RMS). The better \(S/N\), the better the efficiency of muon tagging.

The calibration has been investigated with both physics and CIS events. For the physics events, the individual calibration constants are obtained in the same way as those for the adder tower sum. These constants are the slopes of the amplitude vs. the digitized signal over the whole muon signal spectrum, using either projective beam or 90 deg beams. For the CIS events, the slope of the reconstructed amplitude vs. the applied charge8 is considered as the calibration constant. About 30 channels were calibrated using this procedure during several testbeam periods in 2003, the results are shown in Fig. 12.

Footnote 8: This is equivalent to using the digitized signal after applying the CIS calibration in the digitized readout channels.

Naively one would expect the physics and CIS calibration constants to be identical. This is not the case, but they are highly correlated as demonstrated in Fig. 13 (their ratio for individual channels amounts to mean value of 1.07 with a

RMS 1%). The difference is due to the different pulse shapes (see Section 3.1.1). Let us suppose a signal of the total charge \(Q\) occurs at the input of the readout system (either coming from a photomultiplier or injected using CIS). The value of Q is determined by fitting the expected pulse shape of the signal to the set of samples spaced at 25 ns intervals (see also Section 3.1.2 and Fig. 7). If the amplitude from the fit is \(A\), the reconstructed charge reads

\[Q=k\,A\int p(t)\,\mathrm{d}t \tag{3}\]

where \(p(t)\) stands for the normalized pulse shape and \(k\) is a parameter characterizing the electronics. The adder muon output calibration constants \(C\) are evaluated as

\[C=\frac{A_{\mathrm{a}}\ [\,\mathrm{counts}\,]}{Q_{\mathrm{d}}\ [\,\mathrm{pC}\,]} \tag{4}\]

both for physics and CIS events9, subscripts a,d denote analog and digital signal respectively. Thus, using the Eqs. (3) and (4) one can express the ratio of the calibration constants \(C(\mathrm{physics})/C(\mathrm{CIS})\) as

Footnote 9: For CIS events, \(p(t)\) is considered as the pure CIS pulse shape, i.e. leakage pulse is already subtracted.

\[\frac{C(\mathrm{physics})}{C(\mathrm{CIS})}=\left(\frac{\int p_{\mathrm{d}}(t )\,\mathrm{d}t}{\int p_{\mathrm{a}}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t}\right)(\mathrm{physics}) \times\left(\frac{\int p_{\mathrm{a}}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t}{\int p_{\mathrm{d}}(t )\,\mathrm{d}t}\right)(\mathrm{CIS})=1.05 \tag{5}\]

This is very close to the 7% difference found between the two sets of calibration constants (see Fig. 12 and text above).

Taking into account the calibration obtained with physics events and the readout chain parameters (see also Eq. (2)), the average gain of the adder muon output amounts to

\[G(\mathrm{muon})=26.6\ \mathrm{counts/pC}\times\frac{1}{0.65}\times\sqrt{2} \times 4.9\ \mathrm{mV/count}=284\ \mathrm{mV/pC} \tag{6}\]

Figure 13: The correlation of the adder muon output calibration constants obtained with physics and CIS events.

This value matches very well the laboratory-measured gain (see Section 2).

The signal-to-noise ratio describes the ability of tagging an isolated muon above the pedestal. The ratio has been measured with the high-energy muon beams as a function of \(\eta\). The results are shown in Fig. 14. The values correspond to the sum of two adder muon outputs seeing the same cell.

The values in the extended barrel are larger than in the barrel range due to bigger cells in radial direction and longer muon track-length at larger \(\eta\). However, \(S/N\) drops at \(\eta=1.35\) because muons leave the side of the calorimeter and only partially cross the D-cell. Smaller \(S/N\) value at \(\eta=1.15\) is due to the fact that muons at this angle cross two D-cells (D-5 and D-6), but only that with higher signal is considered here for consistency (i.e. sum of 2 PMTs only as done for other cases).

The signal-to-noise ratio \(S/N=2.84\) at \(\eta=0.15\) translates to efficiency \(\sim 89\%\) with 90% of noise rejection or efficiency \(\sim 83\%\) with 95% of noise rejection. Here the noise \(N\) arises only from the electronics. False tags from calorimeter signals associated with hadrons are neglected.

When considering only a single muon output (i.e. 1 PMT of the two reading the given cell), \(S/N\) decreases by the factor \(\sqrt{2}\). The efficiency of muon tagging is then \(\sim 76\%\) (\(\eta=0.15\)) with 90% noise rejection (eff. \(\sim 68\%\) with 95% of noise rejection). The typical noise RMS in a single muon output corresponds to 0.15 GeV.

The improvement of the adder muon output performance with respect to its previous version (see Section 2) can be demonstrated by comparing the efficiency of tagging isolated muons vs. remaining fraction of noise for the given pseudo-rapidity. Such dependence is shown in Fig. 15, where the final performance is compared to the best case (in terms of readout settings) achieved in older testbeams, when the previous adder board version was used. The improvement manifests itself especially for small pseudorapidities - the efficiency

for \(\eta=0.15\) (final setup) is even better than that for \(\eta=0.20\) with the older version (in the right plot, one should consider only the squares, since they correspond to the final HV settings policy). Also note that the final performance shown in Fig. 15 corresponds to an "average" case (in the final setup, several modules have been analyzed and that with the average performance is chosen here).

It should be noted that the demonstrated improvement is limited by the fact that the adder board circuit deals with the low-gain signal only. Better performance could be obtained if a high-gain signal would be used for the muon output, but this would require substantial changes in other electronics components as well.

## 4 Conclusions

In this note, the adder board performance was fully characterized with test-beam data and with different readout setups. The results show the complete agreement with the designed specifications.

The main results obtained from the testbeam measurements for the trigger output are summarized here: 10.1 mV/pC calibration, non-linearity smaller than 1% for energies above 65 GeV and the time alignment for physics better than 1 ns. For the muon output, the main results are: 284 mV/pC mean calibration factor and signal-to-noise ratio \(S/N>2.8\) for all pseudorapidities.

The muon output gain modification together with the new readout setup and the increased PMT gain improved the signal-to-noise ratio and hence the efficiency of isolated muon tagging as can be seen from the comparison with the previous results.

Figure 15: The comparison of the final adder board performance (left plot) and the previous version used in 2001 beam tests [4] (right plot). When comparing the results, one should consider only the full and open squares in the right plot, since they correspond to the final HV settings.
