**CABLES TRANSMISSION OF FAST PULSES FOR:**

**THE LEVEL 1 CALORIMETER-TRIGger IN ATLAS.**

**TRIGger LVL1 "Tower Builder".**

**An important part of the level 1 trigger is the sum of the energies in neighbouring cells to build "tower signals". On the front-end board, the analogue signals of the cells are summed by groups of 8 in each shaper and sent by short coaxial cables to cards which contain linear mixers.**

**A linear mixer (1 trigger tower signal) is the sum of 7 groups of 8 cells each (4 groups from the front sampling, 2 from the middle, and 1 from the back) in the barrel. The schematic of the linear mixer is given in figure 1.**

**One programmable delay line per group of 8 cells can compensate differences in delay between the front, middle and back parts of the calorimeter, both for cable length and propagation time of the particles.**

**An amplifier with a sin@ gain converts the output of the linear mixer, (proportional to deposited energy) to a voltage proportional to transverse energy. This amplifier can also compensate for the attenuation of the signal in the coaxial cable going to the FADC in the counting room. The linear mixers are located near the front-end cards, in the same crate (figure 2).**

**Fig 2**

In the barrel there are 1792 trigger towers, and for one end-cap there are 640 trigger towers. We propose that each analog sum of each "trigger tower" is sent via a 50 / 70 m coaxial cable to a 8 bits FADC in front of the level 1 trigger system. We have chosen a small coaxial cable ( KX3 type ) 2.8 mm in diameter, 50 \(\Omega\) impedance, with low loss.

For the barrel, half the level 1 trigger cables will exit the calorimeter region at each end, forming a cable bundle of 90 mm diametre; for one end-cap the corresponding cable bundle is 75 mm diameter.

The delay for 70 m of coaxial cable is 365 nsec ( 5.2 ns/m measured ). Figure 3 shows the attenuations of a signal similar to a calorimeter one, for different lengths of cables, and the increase of the full with half maximum ( FWHM ).

**Fig 3**

The pulse shape degradation resulting of lossy cables generate long tails to the pulses which may be removed using passive filters. We have studied, theoretically and experimentally the transmission of pulses and the filters for different cables and to obtain a good solution in the case of the level 1 trigger.

Compensation of cable using passive filters.

STEP FUNCTION RESPONSE OF A CABLE.

All physically realizable cables have losses, which change whith frequency. In our case, for transmission of pulses of level 1 trigger, skin effect losses in the cables predominate.

The step function response of a cable is given by:

\[\mathbf{E_{out}=E_{in}\left(1\ -\ \mathrm{erf}\ \frac{bl}{\sqrt{2(t-\tau)}}\right)}\]

( F. Kirsten and R. Wallace, Laurence Radiation Laboratory, Berkeley TID-24681, 1958).

Where:

Eout = Voltage at distance 1 from input, at time t.

Ein = Amplitude of step of voltage applied to input at t=0.

I = Distance from input.

b = Constant for the particular cable.

erf = Error function.

T = Transit time of cable defined as the value of t at which the voltage at 1 first begins to change.

A normalized curve of Eout/Ein is shown in fig.4, and to is the value 0-50% rise time, of t-T at which Eout/Ein = 1/2.

Also when fast pulse like the level 1 trigger pulses are transmitted through 70 m of coaxial cable, it is necessary to correct the distortion resulting in slow rise time of the cable.

We describe a simple method, with passive filters, which compensates lossy cables and insures correct signal transmission. The technique is based on the principle of signal shortening obtained by "pole zero compensation",a complete calculation is given in the thesis of Gisele Martin LAL-RT 87-10.
