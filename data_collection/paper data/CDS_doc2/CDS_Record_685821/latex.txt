**RECOMMENDATION ON THE TRIGger SCHEME FROM THE MUON REVIEW PANEL**

**B. AUBERT, G. BATTISTONI, B. DOLOGSHEIN, C. GUYOT, W. WITZELING**

All the components needed for the muon detection system are closely connected, however, the Muon Review Panel had to work separately on the two different aspects, muon tracking and muon triggering.

Physics requirements

The triggering on leptons is of greatest importance for the discovery potential of the ATLAS detector and does not need to be explained here. In order to cover the wide field of physics processes, the level 1 trigger system should allow to identify and trigger on muons from very low (6 GeV/c, for B physics) to the high \(\rm p_{t}\) range (40 GeV/c for heavy boson search) with a sharp and tuneable threshold.

The trigger must work with high reliability up to the highest luminosity and should provide a certain redundancy as to offer sufficient safety margins with respect to background, it should give some flexibility to adapt to unexpected situations (e.g. vetoing certain areas of the detector).

In addition the trigger must provide an unambiguous bunch crossing identification. Because of the large geometrical dimensions, special care must be taken to assure synchronisation between the different areas of the detector.

Finally, the trigger system should not significantly deteriorate the performance of the precision tracking chambers (through the addition of material of dedicated trigger chambers).

### Stand alone versus integrated scheme

On several occasions (e.g. November 1993 ATLAS week) the various aspects of a trigger scheme using separate trigger chambers were discussed with respect to a trigger scheme deriving the signals from the tracking detectors themselves. The main points of consideration there are the precision in the bunch crossing identification and the rate and occupancy level in the different parts of the detector. In addition the second co-ordinate is required which could be easily derived from a dedicated trigger system. Considerable effort would be required to derive the second co-ordinate from the precision chambers. The separation in time between two bunch crossings is 25ns, a trigger scheme able to work with a much shorter time resolution will allow gating thereby reducing the background rates significantly.

The concept of a dedicated trigger system with two stations (in the middle and the outer layer), as described in the Muon Note 042 would meet the physics requirements and provides sufficient robustness against background.

### The PANEL RECOMMENTS THE USE OF A DEDICATED TRIGger DETECTOR.

### Present situation

Several detectors have been presented to the Review Panel: Resistive plate chambers (RPC), thin gap chambers (TGC) and straw tubes. The Panel considered the characteristics of the proposed technologies, their performance, price and their impact on the precision tracking.

In addition, for the very forward region (\(\eta\) = 2.3 - 2.5) Interpolating Cathode Strip Chambers have been proposed (Muon Note 038).

In the following some of the features of the RPC and TGC are recalled, more details can be found in the Muon Note 042 and previous notes.

* Properties of the RPC.

The resistive plate chamber are rather easy to build on an industrial scale and considerable experience has been gained in this respect. The weak point is the rate capability. Since last year, a lot of work has been performed on low gas amplification which shows that RPCs can be used up to the kHz regime. The sensitivity of the chamber to the low energy neutrons and photons has been demonstrated to be below 10-2. The cost of the detector mechanics has been evaluated to be of about 330CHF/m\({}^{2}\). The appropriate electronics needs still to be implemented.

* Properties of the TGC.

The thin gap chamber is presently in use at the OPAL detector at LEP. Since then more tests have been performed on the rate capability of this detector. In short, albeit the rise time of the TGC is slower than the one of the RPC (10ns compared to 1.5ns), the rate capability is two orders of magnitude higher. In addition, TGCs provide a better space resolution. This turns out to be a very useful feature in the regions where the magnetic field is expected to be highly non-uniform (for instance, in the transition region from the barrel to the endcap). In those cases trigger windows much narrower than in the barrel are required. The cost of the detector mechanics is about 530CHF/m\({}^{2}\). The performance of the TGC is not deteriorated by heavy radiation exposure which allows to use this technology in a very hot environment.

* Interference with the precision measurement. Even if we don't know today the real performance of the tracking system, the amount of material which is added by the trigger chambers to the muon spectrometer is of concern. Preliminary design concepts show an amount of 0.112 Xo of extra material, giving a contribution of 1% in dp/p at \(\eta\) =0. The impact of this additional material has been studied by Monte Carlo on the very sensitive channel of Higgs decaying into four muons. For a mass window of +-2 sigma the significance of the ratio signal/background is reduced by 2%.

The muon trigger community proposed recently a concept using the RPC for the barrel region and the TGC for the forward region. A detailed description of this scheme can be found in the Muon Note 042 and its addendum. Although initially, like for the tracking system, the Panel did not favour the mixing of different technologies, considering the rate capabilities, the price and other factors, it came to the conclusion that the proposed combination of the RPC and TPC technology is a good compromise.

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATION

The Muon Review Panel expresses satisfaction about the amount of work performed by the muon community in the area of trigger chambers in order to define the operating conditions in the ATLAS environment.

The Panel considers as very positive the fact that the concerned institutes have been able to work closely together on radiation and rate aspects. The community dedicated to the muon trigger (11 laboratories, so far) seems strong enough.

The Panel considers that the proposed trigger scheme fulfils the physics requirements and the break up of technologies is well motivated by optimisation of rate capability, trigger window, radiation hardness and cost efficiency.

The Panel considers that the R&D is not yet completed. For instance the design of the front end electronic must be finalised. Also the amount of material, the gas mixture and the operating conditions have still to be optimised. The layout in the barrel part and especially in the end cap part has to be worked out in more detail and the integration of the trigger detector into the whole muon system has to be better understood. The possible use of Cathode Strip Chambers in the very forward region should be studied in more detail.

## 11 In conclusion

THE MUON REVIEW PANEL RECOMMENTS TO THE ATLAS COLLABORATION TO ENDORSE THE PROPOSAL PRESENTED IN THE NOTE MUON-NO-042 AND ITS ADDENDUM AS THE BASELINE DESIGN.
