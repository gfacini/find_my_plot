###### Abstract

This note summarises a simulated analysis of Higgs boson production and decay into \(b\)-quarks in association with a vector boson at the ATLAS detector at the high-luminosity LHC with proton-proton collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=14\TeV\). The vector bosons are reconstructed from final states including at least one electron or muon: \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) or \(W\to\ell\nu\). The analysis uses generator-level Monte Carlo samples to which efficiency and resolution smearing functions are applied to reproduce the expected resolution of the upgraded ATLAS detector for the expected amount of pile-up due to multiple overlapping proton-proton collisions. The expected significance for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) using an average pile-up of \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=60\) is \(3.9\sigma\) for the combined \(ZH(\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}b\bar{b})\) and \(WH(\to\ell\nu b\bar{b})\) channels, yielding an expected error on the signal strength of about 25%. For 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) using an average pile-up of \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=140\) the expected significance is \(8.8\sigma\), and the error on the signal strength is expected to be about 15%.

Introduction

The recent discovery of a particle with a mass of \(m\sim 125\) GeV by the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC [1, 2] in the search for the Higgs boson [3, 4, 5] has been followed with further evidence that particle is compatible with Standard Model Higgs boson [6, 7]. A key prediction of the Standard Model (SM) is that the Higgs boson should couple to all fundamental fermions in proportion to their mass. The largest branching ratio of the SM Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV is predicted to \(b\)-quarks: \(H\to b\bar{b}\), with a branching ratio of 58% [8].

At the LHC, the largest Higgs boson production cross section is through gluon-gluon fusion: \(gg\to H\)[8]. However the search for \(gg\to H\to b\bar{b}\) suffers from a huge background from direct \(b\)-quark production and therefore it is very difficult to trigger on this channel. For this reason, searches for \(H\to b\bar{b}\) are performed in modes where the Higgs boson is produced in association with a vector boson, or top quark-anti-quark pair (\(t\bar{t}\)). In particular subsequent decays to final states containing at least one electron or muon are essential to reduce the overwhelming multijet background. This also allows triggers that rely only on identifying a single high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) electron or muon to be employed.

Throughout this note the use of the term _Higgs boson_ refers to the Standard Model Higgs boson, \(\ell\) refers to electrons and muons \(\{e,\mu\}\) and \(V\) refers to a vector boson \(\{W,Z\}\). The _two-lepton channel_ refers to the final state with two charged leptons due to \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) and _one-lepton channel_ refers to the final state due to one charged lepton, primarily due to \(W\to\ell\nu\). The average number of proton-proton collisions per bunch crossing, or _pile-up_, is denoted by \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\mathrm{pu}}\).

The study presented in this note investigates the sensitivity to Higgs boson production (\(m_{H}=125\) GeV) in association with a \(W\) or \(Z\) boson, where the Higgs boson decays as \(H\to b\bar{b}\), the \(Z\) decays as \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) and \(W\) decays as \(W\to\ell\nu\) at the high-luminosity running of the ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC). Sensitivities are obtained for integrated luminosities of \(300\)  fb\({}^{-1}\) and \(3000\) fb\({}^{-1}\), collision energy of \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV and pile-up of \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\mathrm{pu}}=60\) and \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\mathrm{pu}}=140\) respectively.

The analysis uses particle-level simulation. The response of the upgraded ATLAS detector to the final state particles is parameterised and applied to the output of the Monte Carlo generators. The parameterised response of the detectors expected at high-luminosity LHC conditions is obtained from studies of ATLAS full simulation events samples [9, 10]. All requirements on the final state objects are applied on the parameterised properties.

The analysis follows the general event selection strategy used for the analysis of \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV collision data as presented in Ref. [11], which is referred to in this note as the _benchmark analysis_; the main difference with respect to the benchmark analysis is the higher requirement on \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of reconstructed jets. The resulting distributions of the invariant mass of two \(b\)-tagged jets from signal and background samples and estimations of systematic effects are used as input to a binned likelihood fit which is used to evaluate the significance and expected error on Higgs boson production with \(m_{H}=125\) GeV.

The expected significance is also quoted for different scenarios with reduced estimates of the systematic uncertainties. Since the publication of Ref. [11] several improved analysis techniques have been made available: improvements in the jet calibration and \(b\)-tagging techniques, and the wide use of multivariate analysis, can affect the sensitivity of the analysis. These improvements have not been directly applied to this analysis, however Section 10 presents what the effect of these improvements for high luminosity running might be. Scenarios with no signal theory uncertainty are also presented in Section 10.

It may also be possible to observe \(H\to b\bar{b}\) production in association with \(Z\to\nu\bar{\nu}\) at HL-LHC for high values of missing transverse momentum with the use of new Level 1 topological triggers [12],but a careful investigation of the high luminosity prospects in this channel is beyond the scope of this note.

Further improvements to the sensitivity of \(VH,H\to b\bar{b}\) production at HL-LHC may be achieved by applying jet substructure techniques to analyse very high-\(p_{\text{T}}\) jets, see for example Ref. [13]. However studies of this are beyond the scope of this analysis due, in part, to the lack of an appropriate parameterisation which can be used to extrapolate the performance to the high-luminosity environment.

## 2 Signal and Background Samples

In the Standard Model, \(VH\) production is dominated by quark-initiated processes; \(ZH\) production also has significant contributions from gluon-initiated processes [14, 15]. Monte Carlo events for the \(qq\to WH\) and \(qq\to ZH\) signal are generated using the Pythia8 generator [16] with the CTEQ6L1 [17] parton distribution functions (PDFs) and the AU2 tune for parton showering and hadronisation [18]. \(gg\to ZH\) events were generated using POWHEG [19, 20]; parton showering was performed by Pythia8 with the CT10 [21] PDFs and the AU2 tune. The total production cross sections and associated uncertainties computed at next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in QCD and with next-to-leading order (NLO) electroweak corrections are taken from Refs [22, 23, 24, 15, 25]. Additional NLO corrections are applied to \(qq\) initiated processes as a function of the transverse momentum of the vector boson [11, 26]. Samples were generated using a Higgs mass of 125 GeV. The Higgs boson is set to decay into two \(b\)-quarks. \(W\)-bosons decay as \(W\to e\nu_{e}\), \(W\to\mu\nu_{\mu}\), \(W\to\tau\nu_{\tau}\) and \(Z\)-bosons decay as \(Z\to e^{+}e^{-}\), \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(Z\to\tau^{+}\tau^{-}\).

The main background processes are \(t\bar{t}\) and diboson production for both \(WH\) and \(ZH\), single-top quark production and \(W\)+jets for \(WH\) and \(Z\)+jets for \(ZH\). The Monte Carlo generators and central values of the cross section for the signal and background processes are listed in Table 1.

The \(V\)+jets background is categorised according to the flavour of the two leading jets selected to recon

struct the di-\(b\)-jet mass. The jet flavour tagging procedure is described in Section 3.

Background due to QCD multijet production is estimated from the known multijet background in \(\sqrt{s}\) = 8 \(\mathrm{TeV}\) data [11]. The multijet background is scaled by the increase in gluon-gluon parton luminosity between 8 and 14 \(\mathrm{TeV}\), which corresponds to a factor of \(\sim 2.3\). In the two-lepton channel, the multijet background is considered negligible.

## 3 Object Selections and Event Reconstruction

The analysis presented in this note follows the selection criteria used by the benchmark analysis, but with a harder requirement on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the jets. A further source of background is pile-up. In collision data, pile-up results in the presence of additional reconstructed jets and causes additional energy to be present inside jets originating from the hard-scattering collision. No additional interactions from pile-up are included in the output of the Monte Carlo generators, but the effects of pile-up on the selected physics objects are included in the efficiency and resolution parameterisations. In experimental running conditions pile-up jets can be rejected by requiring a high threshold on the momentum of reconstructed jets. Such a cut is implemented in this analysis.

To increase the sensitivity of the search the analysis is performed in bins; bins are defined using the momentum of the vector boson, \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\), the exclusive number of \(b\)-jet tags and the exclusive number of total jets as given in Table 2. The signal region, consisting of the bins with exactly two \(b\)-jets, has 18 bins: eight for the one-lepton channel and ten for the two-lepton channel.

Identification and reconstruction efficiencies as well as response functions (referred to as smearing functions) of physics objects given for the expected detector and object performance for benchmark high luminosity scenarios are applied to Monte Carlo generator quantities. The efficiencies and smearing functions used in this analysis are summarised below and are taken from studies presented in Refs [9] and [10].

Particle jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{\mathrm{t}}\) algorithm [33], using a distance parameter of \(R=\sqrt{\phi^{2}+\eta^{2}}=0.4\)1. The flavour of the jets is classified using hadrons in a \(R=0.4\) cone around the jet axis: if a \(b\)-hadron is found, the jet is labeled as a \(b\)-jet, if no \(b\)-hadron is found but a \(c\)-hadron the jet is labeled as a \(c\)-jet

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline  & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) bins \\ \hline \hline Bin 1 & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}<90\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\) \\ Bin 2 & \(90\)\(\mathrm{GeV}<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}<120\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\) \\ Bin 3 & \(120\)\(\mathrm{GeV}<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}<160\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\) \\ Bin 4 & \(160\)\(\mathrm{GeV}<p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}<200\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\) \\ Bin 5 & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}>200\)\(\mathrm{GeV}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular} 
\begin{tabular}{c c} \hline \hline Exclusive number \\ of \(b\)-jets \\ \hline \hline
0 & \(2\) \\
1 & \(3\) \\
2 & \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Definition of the bins used in the analysis. The one-lepton analysis uses only \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) bins 2 - 5; bin 1 is not used to avoid the large multijet contamination.

otherwise the jet is labeled as a light jet. The \(b\)-tagging, \(c\) and light jet mis-tag efficiencies parameterisations are those corresponding to the MV1 tagger [10]. The parameterisations are those for a working point with average \(b\)-jet efficiency of 70% in a semi-leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) sample.

The very high pile-up environment introduces challenges to jet reconstruction and calibration including degradation of the jet energy resolution due to the addition of an energy offset. The energy of the particle jets is smeared using an \(\eta\)- and \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\mathrm{pu}}\)-dependent correction derived from fully simulated di-jet Monte Carlo samples [10]. For a central jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=60\GeV\) at \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\mathrm{pu}}=140\) the relative jet energy resolution contribution due to pile-up is \(\sim 32\%\).

In experimental running conditions it is likely a _track-jet confirmation_ requirement will be applied to suppress background from pile-up. Track-jet confirmation requires jets to be reconstructed close to a track originating from the primary vertex. The efficiency of this requirement is emulated in this analysis and is parameterized as 75% for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}<25\GeV\), 85% for jets with \(25\GeV<p_{\mathrm{T}}<35\GeV\) and 95% for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>35\GeV\)[10].

Two categories of electrons and muons are defined, denoted in increasing order of purity as _loose_ and _tight_. Loose electrons and muons are required to have transverse energy \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>10\GeV\) and must fall within the acceptance of the appropriate detector: \(|\eta|<2.47\) for electrons and \(|\eta|<2.7\) for muons. Tight leptons are required to have \(E_{\mathrm{T}}>25\GeV\) with \(|\eta|<2.47\) for electrons and \(|\eta|<2.5\) for muons. Additionally both loose and tight leptons must pass isolation requirements to reject jets. A track isolation requirement is defined using the sum of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all charged particles in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.4\) around the lepton direction over the lepton-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and a calorimeter isolation requirements is defined using the sum of \(E_{\mathrm{T}}\) of all particles in a cone of \(\Delta R=0.3\) around the lepton direction over the lepton-\(E_{\mathrm{T}}\). For loose leptons the track isolation must be \(<10\%\). For tight leptons the track isolation must be \(<4\%\) and the calorimeter isolation must be \(<7\%\).

The probability of a jet being misidentified as an electron is also considered in this analysis: an \(\eta\)-dependent efficiency of up to 11% for a jet to be misidentified as a loose electron and up to 0.48% for a jet to be misidentified as a tight electron is used [9, 10].

Missing transverse momentum, \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\), is calculated from the vector sum of particles in the detector acceptance region and smeared by a parameterized resolution function, derived from samples of \(Z^{\prime}\to t\bar{t}\) production with a full detector simulation, as described in Ref. [9].

## 4 Event Selection

The event selection requirements are summarised in Tables 3 and 4.

Events are required to pass a parameterized trigger requirement of a single electron or muon trigger, as detailed in Ref. [10]. The single electron trigger requires one electron with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>18\GeV\) within \(|\eta|<2.5\) and has an efficiency of 88%. The single muon trigger requires one muon with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\GeV\) with an efficiency of 64% for muons with \(|\eta|<1.0\) and 86% for muons with \(1.0<|\eta|<2.4\).

Events are required to have at least two jets with \(|\eta|<2.5\), with a minimum \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) requirement of 60 GeV on the leading (highest-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) jet and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>40\GeV\) on the sub-leading jet, plus requirements on the \(\Delta R\) between the two jets, as detailed in Table 4. For the final selection both leading jets are required to be \(b\)-tagged. The four-momenta of the two leading jets is used to reconstruct the di-jet invariant mass. A maximum of one additional jet in the event with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>30\GeV\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\) is allowed.

In the one-lepton channel events must be consistent with the presence of a \(W\to\ell\nu\) decay. The transverse mass, \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\), is defined from the transverse momenta and the azimuthal angles of the charged lepton (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}\) and \(\phi^{\ell}\)) and missing transverse momentum (\(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and \(\phi^{\mathrm{miss}}\)): \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}=\sqrt{2\,p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\ell}E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}} (1-\cos(\phi^{\ell}-\phi^{\mathrm{miss}}))}\). The event must contain one tight lepton and no additional loose leptons and pass requirements on \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) and the transverse mass, \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{W}\) as given in Table 4.

In the two-lepton channel events must be consistent with the presence of a \(Z\to\ell\ell\) decay: two loose leptons are required with an invariant mass consistent with a \(Z\)-boson. In addition, the missing transverse energy is required to be \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}<60\) GeV.

## 5 Validation with \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV samples

The analysis framework employed in this note was validated extensively by applying the analysis to the particle-level information of the Monte Carlo samples generated for the \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV benchmark analysis. The Monte Carlo samples are listed in Ref. [11] and have been extensively studied and validated against collision data. The motivation for the validation was to understand the object definitions, event selection, the applied corrections, the fit model presented in Section 8 as well as any discrepancies between the approach applied in this note (particle-level simulation and parameterised detector response) and the full simulation analysis.

Cuts as in Tables 3 and 4 are applied, but with a lower \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut on the jets of 45 GeV on the leading jet and 20 GeV on the sub-leading jet, as done in the benchmark analysis. In addition, the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) cut of the extra jet veto is lowered to 20 GeV.

The smearing functions applied to the \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV samples [9, 10] have been derived assuming different pile-up conditions and an upgraded ATLAS detector, and therefore are not directly applicable to the benchmark analysis samples.

The following summarises the parameterisation of the smearing and efficiency functions applied to the

\(\sqrt{s}=8\) \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) Monte Carlo samples. Where the functions depend on the pile-up, \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\mathrm{pu}}=~{}20\) has been used.

* Single lepton trigger efficiencies were taken from \(\sqrt{s}=8\) \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) studies in Refs. [34] (electron) and [35] (muon). The values used for the reconstruction and identification efficiencies are as for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) as these efficiencies were derived assuming the current 2012 performance.
* The same \(\eta\)- and \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\mathrm{pu}}\)-dependent jet energy resolution parameterisation as used for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) samples. For a central jet with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=60\) at \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\mathrm{pu}}=20\) the relative jet energy resolution contribution due to pile-up is \(\sim 25\%\).
* A track-jet confirmation efficiency of between 90% for tracks of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}=25\) \(\mathrm{\GeV}\) up to 95% for tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of 50 \(\mathrm{\GeV}\) or above [36].
* New \(b-\)tagging efficiency maps were derived from \(\sqrt{s}=8\) \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) data and applied.
* The missing transverse energy resolution parameterisation given in Ref. [10] is used, since it incorporates a parameterisation with continuous \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\mathrm{pu}}\). The missing transverse energy resolution degrades with increasing \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\mathrm{pu}}\).

Figures 1 and 2 show the resulting distribution of the invariant di-\(b\)-jet mass (\(m_{bb}\)) for the \(\sqrt{s}=8\) \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) Monte Carlo generator plus smearing quantities, compared to the results from full simulation of the same samples and the data (taken from the benchmark analysis).

The number of selected muons agrees reasonably well within uncertainties between the smeared particle level and the full simulation analysis. However more low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) electrons (\(\sim 20\%\)) are selected in the particle level analysis than in the full simulation analysis. Differences in the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distributions are also observed: the parameterisation appears to over-smear the \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) distribution when compared to the full simulation by approximately 5%. These differences are propagated to the \(m_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{V}}\) and \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{V}}\) distributions, and have a greater impact in the one-lepton channel. The presence of pile-up jets in the full simulation analysis is another source of discrepancy. Due to the additional pile-up jets, more events in the full simulation analysis (especially for the \(t\bar{t}\) background) are rejected compared to the smeared particle level analysis when the events are categorised in the 2 and 3-jet bins.

The analysis method is also validated by performing the fit to the \(\sqrt{s}=8\) \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) samples, as described in Section 8, with the results given in Table 5. The differences in event yields and kinematics discussed above have a minor impact once the one-lepton and two-lepton channels are combined, and the expected significance and \(\hat{\mu}\) errors are compatible with the benchmark analysis to better than 5%.

\begin{tabular}{c c c c} \hline \hline Sample & \multicolumn{2}{c}{significance of \(\hat{\mu}=1\)} & error on \(\hat{\mu}\) \\ \hline \hline \(\sqrt{s}=8\) \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) validation & One-lepton & 0.84 & \(+1.28~{}-1.19\) \\  & Two-lepton & 0.75 & \(+1.49~{}-1.32\) \\  & One+Two-lepton & 1.14 & \(+0.90~{}-0.83\) \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}

Analysis

Tables 6 and 8 presents the event yields for signal and background for an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), assuming the appropriate smearing and efficiency functions for pile-up of \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=60\). Tables 7 and 9 show the event yields for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\), assuming the appropriate smearing and efficiency functions for pile-up of \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=140\).

Figures 3, 4, 5 and 6 show the di-\(b\)-jet mass distributions for all the signal regions defined in Section 4 for \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeVand an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) (with \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=60\)) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) (\(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=140\)) after applying the selection criteria in Tables 3 and 4.

## 7 Systematic Uncertainties

The study of systematic uncertainties follows closely the strategy used in the benchmark analysis. Only those systematic uncertainties with a non negligible impact in the benchmark analysis are used to build the simplified model of systematic uncertainties used for this analysis. Systematic uncertainties affect the normalisation of the signal or background samples and/or the shapes of the di-\(b\)-jet mass distribution. Each systematic uncertainty is considered as a nuisance parameter in the statistical treatment.

### Experimental Uncertainties

In this analysis only experimental systematic uncertainties on lepton identification, on the jet energy calibration (or jet energy scale, JES), on the resolution of the missing transverse energy and the \(b\)-tagging efficiencies are considered. Other experimental uncertainties were found to have a negligible impact on the analysis.

An uncertainty of \(\pm 1\%\) is used on the identification efficiencies of the electrons and muons.

The default uncertainties on the JES are taken from studies with \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV collision data. These uncertainties are scaled in their \(p_{\rm T}\) range by a factor of 14 TeV/8 TeV\(=1.75\) for the HL-LHC running to approximate what can be expected at higher energy. The uncertainties are \(p_{\rm T}\)- and \(\eta\)-dependent and vary between \(\sim 5\%\) for \(p_{\rm T}=20\) GeV jets in the central region of the detector to \(\sim 2\%\) for jets with \(p_{\rm T}=1\) TeV. The largest component of JES uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in the quark and gluon flavour composition of jets.

The high statistics samples of identified \(b\)-jets which will be obtained at HL-LHC running can be used to vastly reduce the JES uncertainty. Therefore the signal expectation has been calculated using two different JES uncertainty scenarios: one where the uncertainty is 0.1 times the default uncertainty and the other where the uncertainty is 0.05 times the default uncertainty.

A systematic uncertainty associated to the \(E_{\rm T}^{\rm miss}\) parameterisation used in this analysis is applied. Three sources of uncertainties are considered: variations due to different samples (variation of \(\pm 5\%\)), the possible variation of the pile-up noise thresholds (included as a fixed \(\pm 5\) GeV uncertainty) and from calibration of energy clusters not associated to any reconstructed object [9]. These three sources are considered to be uncorrelated.

\(b\)-tagging uncertainties correspond to those used in the benchmark analysis [11]: the \(b\)-tagging efficiency for \(b\)-, \(c\)- and light-jets is measured from \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV data in dedicated samples.

\(b\)-jets. The mis-tag uncertainty is modelled by a single nuisance parameter. In order to simplify the fit model used in this note, only the dominant systematic uncertainty components of the flavour-tagging uncertainties are considered.

In addition a luminosity uncertainty of \(\pm 2.8\%\) is used, as obtained from analysis of special runs with beam-separation scans performed in November 2012 [37]. It is applied to all the backgrounds estimated from simulation.

### Background Only Uncertainties

Systematics related to the background modelling are due to the overall normalisation of the cross sections, the relative normalisation of the backgrounds in the analysis bins (of exclusive jet multiplicities and of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\)) and on the shape of the \(m_{bb}\) distributions. The systematic uncertainties affecting the normalisations were taken from the benchmark analysis. These are considered to be a good estimate as the analysis presented in this note follows the \(\sqrt{s}=8\)\(\mathrm{Te\kern-1.0ptV}\) collision data analysis very closely. Besides the normalisation, only a few of the dominant overall uncertainties were kept, in order to simplify the fitting model. A summary of the allowed variations of the backgrounds is given in Table 10.

### Signal Only Uncertainties

The uncertainties on the inclusive cross sections include those on the renormalisation and factorisation scales (\(0.5-1.5\%\) for \(qq\) and \(50\%\) for \(gg\) induced processes) and on the PDFs (\(3.8\%\) for \(qq\) and \(17\%\) for \(gg\) induced processes) [22]. These two uncertainties are treated as correlated for \(qq\) initial states and decorrelated for \(gg\to ZH\). The relative uncertainty on the Higgs boson branching ratio to \(b\bar{b}\) is \(3.3\%\) for \(m_{H}=125\)\(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\)[38].

As described in Section 2 a NLO electroweak correction is applied to the \(qq\) generated \(WH\) and \(ZH\) signals as a function of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\). The uncertainty on these corrections is \(2\%\), except in the highest \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) interval where it reaches \(2.5\%\) in the \(WH\) channel [11]. It is taken as correlated across \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) intervals and channels. Uncertainties on the signal acceptance due to variations of scale and PDF of the order of \(3\)-\(5\%\) are also applied for different jet multiplicity bins. These uncertainties are treated as correlated for \(qq\) initial states and decorrelated for \(gg\to ZH\)[11].

## 8 Fit Model

The statistical analysis uses a binned likelihood function, \(\mathcal{L}(\mu,\theta)\), constructed as the product of Poisson probability terms. A signal strength parameter, \(\mu\), multiplies the expected SM Higgs boson production cross section. The impact of systematic uncertainties (see Section 7) on the signal and background expectations is described by nuisance parameters, \(\theta\), which are parameterised by Gaussian or log-normal priors. The expected numbers of signal and background events in each bin are functions of \(\theta\). The test statistic \(q_{\mu}\) is then constructed according to the profile likelihood ratio:

\[q_{\mu}=-2\ln\left(\frac{(\mathcal{L}(\mu,\hat{\bar{\theta}}_{\mu})}{ \mathcal{L}(\hat{\mu},\hat{\theta})}\right)\, \tag{1}\]

where \(\hat{\mu}\) and \(\hat{\theta}\) are the parameters that maximise the likelihood (with the constraint \(0\leq\hat{\mu}\leq\mu\)), and \(\hat{\bar{\theta}}_{\mu}\) are the nuisance parameter values that maximise the likelihood for a given \(\mu\). This test statistic is used to obtain the median experimental sensitivity of the search using an _Asimov dataset_ as defined in Ref. [39] and for exclusion intervals derived with the CLs method, defined in Ref. [40].

The inputs to the Asimov dataset are the \(m_{bb}\) distributions in the 18 two-\(b\)-tag signal bins (see Table 2): ten bins for the two-lepton analysis and eight bins for the one-lepton analysis. The normalisations of the different backgrounds are constrained within their uncertainties as described in Section 7.

## 9 Systematic Uncertainties Scenarios

Since the publication of the benchmark analysis, improved analysis techniques and better understanding of the systematic uncertainties can be expected. These result in smaller uncertainties and hence an improved sensitivity.

In this section, several different scenarios of reduced systematic uncertainties, and improved analysis techniques, are introduced. In Section 10 they are used to estimate improvements in sensitivity to the Higgs boson signal strength, \(\hat{\mu}\).

### Reduced Systematic Uncertainties

For the reduction in systematic uncertainties, the following two main scenarios are considered (each one of them with and without signal theory uncertainties):

1. 10% of the JES uncertainty
2. 5% of the JES uncertainty

Note that the JES uncertainty has been observed to have little impact on the two-lepton channel thanks to the lower yields of \(t\bar{t}\) background. The expected performance for this channel is assumed to be the same for both scenarios.

\begin{tabular}{l l|c c c|c} \hline \hline  & & \multicolumn{2}{c}{Normalisation} & \multicolumn{1}{c}{Shape} \\  & Background & Cross section & 2-jet to 3-jet ratio & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) & \(m_{bb}\) \\ \hline Diboson & \(WZ\), \(WW\) and \(ZZ\) & \(\pm 10\)\% & - & - & - \\ Multijet & & \(\pm 10\)\% & - & - & - \\ Single-top & \(t\)-channel & \(\pm 4\)\% & \(\pm 9\)\% & - & Y \\ Single-top & \(s\)-channel & \(\pm 4\)\% & \(\pm 9\)\% & - & Y \\ Single-top & \(Wt\)-production & \(\pm 7\)\% & \(\pm 15\)\% & - & Y \\ \(V\)+jets & \(V\) + \(bb\) production & \(\pm 30\)\% & \(\pm 20\)\% & Y & Y \\ \(V\)+jets & \(V\) + \(cc\) production & \(\pm 30\)\% & \(\pm 10\)\% & Y & Y \\ \(V\)+jets & \(V\)+light production & \(\pm 10\)\% & \(\pm 10\)\% & Y & Y \\ \(t\bar{t}\) & & \(\pm 10\)\% & \(\pm 5\)\% & Y & Y \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 10: A summary of the systematic uncertainties considered on the background samples. The table shows the normalisation uncertainty on each of the backgrounds, between the analysis bins, and whether a shape uncertainty on \(m_{bb}\) is considered. For example, on the \(t\bar{t}\) background, the central value of the cross section has an uncertainty of \(\pm 10\)%, in addition the ratio of the number of events in the 2-jet bin versus the 3-jet bin is allowed to vary by up to 5% more than predicted by the Monte Carlo samples, and similarly the numbers of events in successive \(p_{\mathrm{T}}^{V}\) is allowed to vary. Finally the shape of the \(m_{bb}\) distribution used in the fit can vary within certain limits.

### Improved analysis techniques

Further improvements in the sensitivity can be achieved by using multivariate analysis techniques to select events, a jet calibration with better resolution as would be the case for instance using the Global Sequential calibration [41, 42], and new \(b\)-tagging approaches with improved efficiency such as splitting the events into several categories with different \(b\)-flavour purities.

In the following, a final scenario taking into account an approximate estimate of the impact of such improvements is presented, assuming uncertainty reduction factors based on preliminary studies carried out during Run-I analyses.

Moreover, at the HL-LHC a reduction in some systematic uncertainties is expected due to the large amount of data that will have been collected and analysed. An additional improvement can be obtained by including the \(ZH\to\nu\bar{\nu}b\bar{b}\) final state in the analysis, but a careful investigation of the high luminosity prospects in this channel is beyond the scope of this note.

## 10 Results

The profile likelihood fit with an Asimov dataset with Higgs boson signal strength \(\mu=1\) - corresponding to Higgs boson production at the rate predicted by the Standard Model - is performed for the Higgs boson hypothesis with \(m_{H}=125\) GeV.

For the \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV samples with 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) with \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=60\) and 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) with \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=140\), the expected signal sensitivity for \(m_{H}=125\) GeVas well as the precision on the signal strength measurement for \(VH,H\to b\bar{b}\) are shown in Tables 11 and 12. The main systematic uncertainties for the combined analysis for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) with \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=60\) correspond to the jet energy scale systematic and the modelling of the \(t\bar{t}\) and \(W+bb\) backgrounds, while for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) with \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=140\) they correspond to theory signal uncertainties (PDF and signal acceptance due to variations of scale) and \(t\bar{t}\) modelling.

Tables 13 and 14 show the final sensitivity results after scaling to include the perspective of a more performant updated \(b\)-tagging strategy and jet calibration and the introduction of a multivariate event selection in the analysis, as described in Section 9.2.

In this context and considering scenario I, with an integrated luminosity of 300 fb\({}^{-1}\), the \(VH(H\to bb)\) production may be observed with an expected significance of 3.9\(\sigma\) and the uncertainty on \(\hat{\mu}\) is expected

## 11 Conclusion

A study of Higgs boson production in association with leptonically decaying \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons using parameterised functions to model the behaviour of the upgraded ATLAS detector at the high-luminosity LHC with \(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV has been performed.

Following the analysis strategy described in Ref. [11], and using only the decay modes of the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons leading to a high energy electron or muon in the final state, we obtain expected sensitivities to observe the Standard Model Higgs boson production with \(m_{H}=125\) GeV of \(2.6\sigma\) and to measure the signal strength with a precision of \(\Delta\hat{\mu}=\begin{subarray}{c}{}^{+0.39}_{-0.38}\end{subarray}\) for 300 fb\({}^{-1}\) for a pile-up of \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=60\) and of \(5.9\sigma\), \(\Delta\hat{\mu}=\pm 0.19\) for 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\) for a pile-up of \(\langle\mu\rangle_{\rm pu}=140\).

Extrapolating the expected improvements to our understanding of systematic errors and of already demonstrated improvements due to \(b\)-tagging and the use of a multivariate selection, the significance will be
