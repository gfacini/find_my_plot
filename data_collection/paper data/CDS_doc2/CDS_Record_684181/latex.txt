## 1 Introduction

Recently [1] some results have been shown about the spread of the maximum drift time in a sample of MDT tubes with a serial gas distribution. The difference in drift velocity has been attributed to the amount of water vapour in the MDT gas, in a quantity which depends on the position of the tube along the gas flow path.

This effect, if not corrected, has unpleasant consequences. The definition of a common r(t) relation for all the MDTs in the same spatial region becomes impossible and, therefore, the autocalibration procedure is compromised. In order to have the same fraction of water vapour everywhere, it has also been suggested to design the gas flow scheme, such that all the tubes are in parallel with respect to the gas distribution.

In this note, we describe the measurement of the maximum drift time in the Calypso chamber, using data taken in the H8 test beam during the summer 1996.

## 2 Set-up

Calypso [2] consists of two separate multilayers, in the following called Calypso 1 and Calypso 2. Each multilayer is made of three layers of staggered tubes, of 1.5 cm radius and 260 cm total length, for a total of 96 tubes for each chamber. The gas mixture was Ar (91%), N2 (4%), CH4In the following, the tubes are numbered from 1 to 9, according to their position in the chain. If the water vapour comes mainly from the jumpers or from a bad gas tightness at the jumper-endplug connection, the maximum drift time of a given tube should exhibit a linear dependence on its position number, as observed in [1].

## 3 Method of analysis

The maximum drift time has been evaluated with two independent methods.

a) In the first method, for each individual tube the time distribution of the hits has been fitted with an appropriate function :

\[N(t)=P_{{}_{1}}+\frac{P_{{}_{2}}+P_{{}_{3}}\cdot\exp(-t\ /\ P_{{}_{4}})}{ \left[1+\exp(\frac{P_{{}_{5}}-t\ }{A})\right]\cdot\left[1+\exp(\frac{t\ -P_{{}_{6}}}{B})\right]} \tag{1}\]

where _N(t)_ is the number of hits in each drift time interval. The parameters _P1_..._P6_ are fitted for each tube. _P1_ represents the constant uncorrelated background, _P2, P3_ and _P4_ describe the non-uniform top of the distribution, and finally _P5_ and _P6_ fit the minimum and maximum drift time. \(A\) and \(B\) are fixed in all the fits and describe the shape of the rise and the fall of the distribution. We notice that _P4_ and the ratio _P3/P2_ are essentially the same, within the errors, for all the tubes and could be held constant in the fit without substantial differences in the results.The maximum drift time of a tube is defined as :

\[\Delta t=P_{{}_{6}}-P_{{}_{5}} \tag{2}\]

Note that the value of \(\Delta t\) and its error are independent from \(t_{{}_{0}}\). Fig. 1 shows a typical time spectrum, with the fit superimposed, after subtracting the tube \(t_{{}_{0}}\) (for the method, see [2]). Fig. 2 shows the values of \(\Delta t\), as a function of the tube position number. The statistical errors are given by the fit. The points suggest a systematic discrepancy between Calipso 1 and Calypso 2, possibly due to the different TDC clock. However, no dependence on the position number up to a fraction of nanosecond is apparent.

b) In the second method, the maximum drift time is measured with the help of another tube, in the following called the auxiliary tube, in the same multilayer along the track path. For tubes belonging to the first and third layer, the auxiliary tube is the one in the middle layer, while for tubes in the middle layer we use the tube which follows along the track. Since this method requires that all the tubes along the track are fully efficient, we have restricted the analysis to Calypso 2.

The time window is chosen far from \(t_{0}\), to avoid the pathological region of small efficiency near the wall of the selected tube, but at values small enough to keep the effect under study at a reasonable size. In this way, the measured time \(\Delta t^{\prime}\) does not correspond to the maximum time, but rather it is the time associated to a drift path \(d\), such that

\[d\equiv\mbox{radius}-r(t=35+45\mbox{nsec})\,. \tag{10}\]

However, the difference between the values of \(\Delta t^{\prime}\) for two tubes is equivalent to the difference between the maximum drift times. Fig. 3 shows some typical time distributions, together with their fits. Fig. 4, analogous to fig. 2, shows the times \(\Delta t^{\prime}\) correspond to different tube position numbers. The errors are computed by summing in quadrature the statistical uncertainties of the fit of fig.3 and of \(t_{0}\). Also in this case, no dependence on the tube position is observed. By comparing Fig.2 and 4, we notice that the two methods, even if essentially independent, give similar results for Calypso 2.

## 4 Conclusion

No effect dependent on the tube position along the gas path is visible up to a fraction of nanosecond.
