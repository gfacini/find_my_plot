###### Abstract

The capabilities of measuring \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations in proton-proton interactions with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider are evaluated. \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates in the \(D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) decay modes from semileptonic exclusive events are simulated and reconstructed using a detailed detector description and the ATLAS software chain. For the measurement of the oscillation frequency a \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity limit of 29.6 ps\({}^{-1}\) and a five standard deviation measurement limit of 20.5 ps\({}^{-1}\) are derived from unbinned maximum likelihood amplitude fits for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\). The initial flavour of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson is tagged exclusively with opposite-side leptons. Trigger strategies are proposed for scenarios of different instantaneous luminosities in order to maximise the signal channel trigger efficiencies.

Introduction

As tests of the Standard Model the CP-violation parameter \(\sin(2\,\beta)\) will be measured with high precision (at the percent level) as well as properties of the \(B_{s}^{0}\)-meson system, like the mass difference of the two mass eigenstates \(\Delta m_{s}\), the lifetime difference \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}/\Gamma_{s}\) and the weak mixing phase \(\phi_{s}\) induced by CP-violation, with \(\phi_{s}\approx 2\,\lambda^{2}\,\eta\) in the Wolfenstein parametrisation. The different masses of the CP-eigenstates \(B_{s}^{L}\) (CP-even) and \(B_{s}^{H}\) (CP-odd) give rise to \(B_{s}\) mixing. The observed \(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) particles are linear combinations of these eigenstates, where transitions are allowed due to non-conservation of flavour in weak-current interactions and will occur with a frequency proportional to \(\Delta m_{s}\). \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations have been observed at the Fermilab Tevatron collider by the CDF collaboration [1] measuring a value of \(\Delta m_{s}=(17.77\pm 0.10\,(\mathrm{stat})\pm 0.07\,(\mathrm{sys}))\,\mathrm{ ps}^{-1}\) and D0 collaboration [2] reporting a two-sided bound on the \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillation frequency with a range of \(17\,\mathrm{ ps}^{-1}<\Delta m_{s}<21\) ps\({}^{-1}\). Both results are consistent with Standard Model expectations [3]. In ATLAS, the \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement is an important baseline for the B-physics program and an essential ingredient for a precise determination of the phase \(\phi_{s}\). CP-violation in \(B_{s}^{0}\)-\(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) mixing is a prime candidate for the discovery of non-standard-model physics. For the channel \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\), which has a clean experimental signature, a very small CP-violating asymmetry is predicted in the Standard Model. The measurement of any sizeable effect of the weak-interaction-induced phase \(\phi_{s}\) in the CKM matrix, which lies above the predicted value, would indicate that processes beyond the Standard Model are involved. Furthermore, the determination of important parameters in the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson system will be valuable input for flavour dynamics in the Standard Model and its extensions.

In this note an estimation of the sensitivity to measure the \(B_{s}^{0}\)-\(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) oscillation frequency with the ATLAS detector is presented. The signal channels considered are the hadronic decay channels \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) with \(D_{s}^{-}\to\phi\pi^{-}\) followed by \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\). In the case of \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) the \(a_{1}^{+}\) decays as \(a_{1}^{+}\to\rho\,\pi^{+}\) with \(\rho\to\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\). Including the sub-decay \(D_{s}^{-}\to K^{*0}K^{-}\)[4] would increase the event statistics by about 30%. However, for these sub-channels, which require an additional trigger signature, the increase of the overall trigger rate would be unacceptable. Detailed information of the signal and the exclusive background channels is given in Section 2. The high event rate at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) imposes very selective requirements onto the B-physics trigger strategies, reducing the rate by about six orders of magnitude for recording events. Since an initial "low-luminosity" running period is scheduled with a luminosity starting at \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and rising to \(2\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), followed later on by the design luminosity of the LHC of \(10^{34}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), the B-trigger must be flexible enough to cope with the increasing luminosity conditions. The overall B-trigger strategy as well as the different strategies dealing with the luminosity scenarios in the initial running periods are discussed in Section 3. An important part of the mixing measurement is to identify the flavour at production, i.e., whether the observed \(B_{s}\) meson initially contained a \(b\) or a \(\bar{b}\) quark. A detailed description of an opposite-side lepton flavour tag and of the various sources of the wrong tag fractions is given in Section 4. The selection of \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates with kinematic cuts as well as mass resolutions of the \(B_{s}^{0}\), are explained and shown in Section 5. A luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and no pileup is considered for the detailed analysis of signal and background channels. Strategies for lower and higher luminosities are also discussed in the same section. The results of the signal-candidate selection are used as input to a toy Monte Carlo simulation generating a sample of \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates, which is used for the amplitude fit method [5] to obtain the \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement limits. The construction of the likelihood function, the Monte Carlo sample and the extraction of the \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity are discussed in Section 6.

## 2 Simulated Data Samples

Simulated \(b\)-quark pairs are generated using Pythia[6], with the \(\bar{b}\)-quark required to decay to one of the specified signal channels. The \(b\)-quark decays semileptonically producing a muon with \(p_{T}>6\)within \(|\eta|<2.5\). Details on generation, simulation and reconstruction of the simulated data samples are given in the introduction of the B-chapter [7].

In addition to the simulated signal samples \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\pi^{-})\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\pi^{-})a_{1}^{+}\), corresponding exclusive background channels that give an irreducible contribution to the selected \(B_{s}^{0}\) signal were investigated. Two \(B_{d}^{0}\) decay channels, \(B_{d}^{0}\to D^{-}\pi^{+}/a_{1}^{+}\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{+}\pi^{-}/a_{1}^{-}\), and one \(B_{s}^{0}\) channel, \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{*-}\pi^{+}/a_{1}^{+}\), were simulated for both hadronic decay channels. The dedicated trigger studies described in Section 3 require additional samples, such as the inclusive background channels \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 6X\), \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 4X\) and \(c\bar{c}\to\mu 4X\) containing semileptonic \(b\) or \(c\) decays requiring one muon with a generated \(p_{T}>4\) GeV (or 6 GeV) and further decay products (\(X\)). Also, one particular signal sample (as a choice \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\)) requiring one muon with a generated \(p_{T}>4\) GeV (identified by \((\mu 4)\)) is used for the trigger studies. A sample of minimum bias events is used for the determination of overall trigger rates. See Table 1 for the number of events generated and the cross-sections calculated from the values given by Pythia and the appropriate branching ratios [8]. Errors on the cross-sections include statistical errors and contributions from the uncertainties on the branching ratios.

Effects of pileup and \(B\)-meson mixing were not included in the simulation of any of the samples.

## 3 Trigger Strategies

The trigger strategy used for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channels is to identify the \(D_{s}^{\pm}\) decaying to \(\phi(\to K^{+}K^{-})\)\(\pi\), which is common to both decay channels. At level one (LVL1) a muon is required to enrich the content of the triggered data sample with B-events. The high level trigger (HLT) is split into level two (LVL2) and Event Filter (EF). A search for a \(D_{s}^{\pm}\) is performed following one of two strategies. The first method, the FullScan approach, performs reconstruction of tracks within the entire Inner Detector. It is an efficient method, but time consuming and its feasibility depends on the background event rate. The second method performs track reconstruction in a limited volume of the Inner Detector only, which is defined by a low-\(p_{T}\) jet region of interest (RoI) identified at LVL1. This RoI-based method

is faster but there is a loss in efficiency due to the requirement of a LVL1 jet RoI in the event and the geometrical restriction to the RoI.

The increase of the luminosity after LHC startup affects the trigger in two ways: the trigger rates for the jet and muon trigger will increase, seeding the HLT \(D_{s}^{\pm}\) algorithm more frequently, and combinatorial background from pileup affects the performance of the selection algorithm. Therefore, trigger menus corresponding to different LHC luminosities are discussed in Sections 3.4 to 3.6.

The trigger efficiencies are presented for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel. Results for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel are expected to be similar within a few percent (see Section 3.2).

### LVL1 Trigger Selection

The ATLAS hardware allows three LVL1 low-\(p_{T}\) muon trigger thresholds to be defined at once, which can only be adjusted between runs by reconfiguring the lookup tables implemented in the muon trigger firmware. In order to study more than three thresholds we investigated the two available, pre-defined menus (named A and B) with respect to the low-\(p_{T}\) muon trigger thresholds2).

Footnote 2): All presented trigger thresholds are meant to be inclusive, i.e. to include all events fulfilling a trigger signature with a \(p_{T}\) threshold equal to or higher than the indicated one.

The three implemented low-\(p_{T}\) thresholds for trigger menu A are: 0 GeV3) (named MU00), 5 GeV (MU05) and 6 GeV (MU06). For trigger menu B, the three low-\(p_{T}\) thresholds are 6 GeV (MU06), 8 GeV (MU08), and 10 GeV (MU10). Figure 1 shows the efficiencies of the low-\(p_{T}\) LVL1 muon trigger signatures as a function of the true \(p_{T}\) of the muon with the highest \(p_{T}\) in the event.

Footnote 3): This requires a coincidence between the muon chambers without an actual threshold applied. Due to the detector geometry this corresponds to an effective transverse momentum threshold of about 4 GeV.

The LVL1 trigger efficiency depends strongly on the threshold chosen for the transverse momentum of the muon as shown in Table 2. Note that there is a discrepancy between the MU06 efficiencies from both trigger menus, which will be taken as a systematic uncertainty of the current implementation. Although these dedicated trigger studies have been performed with the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) sample, the LVL1 efficiencies for \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}(\mu 6)\) have been checked and agree well with those in Table 2.

The input to the LVL1 calorimeter trigger is a set of \(\sim\)7 200 trigger towers with granularity \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta\approx 0.1\times 0.1\) formed by the analogue summation of calorimeter cells. There are separate sets of

Figure 1: Muon trigger efficiency as a function of the true \(p_{T}\) of the muon with the highest \(p_{T}\) in the event for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}(\mu 4)\) for (a) trigger menu A and (b) trigger menu B.

trigger towers for the EM and hadronic calorimeters. The LVL1 jet algorithm employed here uses a cluster of \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta\) of approximately \(0.4\times 0.4\) (corresponding to 4\(\times\)4 trigger towers). The projections of the vectors of the energy depositions onto the plane perpendicular to the beam axis (transverse energy, \(E_{T}\)) are summed over both the electromagnetic and the hadronic layers. The jet algorithm moves the cluster template in steps of 0.2 across the \(\phi\times\eta\) plane. An RoI is produced if the \(4\times 4\) cluster is a local \(E_{T}\) maximum (as defined in [10]) and the cluster \(E_{T}\) sum is greater than the required threshold. The jet RoI is usable if the average number of RoIs per event (RoI multiplicity, see Fig. 2 and Table 3) is small, ideally about 1-2. Clearly, a compromise is required as an increased threshold will reduce the multiplicity, but will also give a reduced efficiency for finding the \(B\) jet in an event.

For a transverse energy threshold of 4 GeV, which is implemented to initiate the LVL2 \(D_{s}^{\pm}\) trigger in trigger menus A and B, the jet trigger has an acceptance of \((98.36\pm 0.06)\,\%\) based on all events in the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) sample.

### LVL2 Trigger Selection

The first step of LVL2 is to confirm the LVL1 muon trigger decision using more precise muon momentum measurement. Secondly, information from Inner Detector and muon chambers are combined to give a further improvement in the momentum measurement.

\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Menu & Threshold & \multicolumn{5}{c|}{Efficiency [\%]} \\ \cline{3-6}  & & \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) & \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) & \(bb\to\mu 4X\) & \(bb\to\mu 6X\) & \(c\bar{c}\to\mu 4X\) \\  & & \((\mu 4)\) & \((\mu 6)\) & & & \\ \hline \hline  & MU00 & \(75.65\pm 0.19\) & \(86.77\pm 0.15\) & \(71.74\pm 0.14\) & \(86.60\pm 0.07\) & \(70.42\pm 0.22\) \\ A & MU05 & \(68.41\pm 0.21\) & \(82.60\pm 0.17\) & \(63.51\pm 0.15\) & \(81.91\pm 0.08\) & \(62.05\pm 0.23\) \\  & MU06 & \(58.93\pm 0.22\) & \(81.90\pm 0.17\) & \(52.28\pm 0.16\) & \(81.00\pm 0.08\) & \(50.44\pm 0.24\) \\ \hline  & MU06 & \(61.15\pm 0.22\) & \(83.83\pm 0.16\) & — & — & — \\ B & MU08 & \(44.78\pm 0.22\) & \(77.64\pm 0.19\) & — & — & — \\  & MU10 & \(34.89\pm 0.21\) & \(65.47\pm 0.21\) & — & — & — \\ \hline \end{tabular}

The first three lines refer to trigger menu A [9], while the last three lines refer to trigger menu B.

Table 3: Mean and root mean square of the RoI multiplicity distributions (Figure 2) for the background samples as a function of the jet RoI transverse energy (\(E_{T}\)) threshold [9]. Only RoIs with \(\eta<2.4\) have been taken into account. A strong anticorrelation between the \(E_{T}\) threshold and the mean RoI multiplicity is observed.

Figure 2: RoI multiplicity distributions for the background samples (a) for \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 4X\), (b) for \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 6X\) and (c) for \(c\bar{c}\to\mu 4X\) as a function of the jet RoI energy threshold [9]. Only RoIs with \(\eta<2.4\) have been taken into account. This corresponds to the requirement that the RoI is to be contained within the solid angle covered by the Inner Detector.

As described above, the LVL2 tracking can be run in either FullScan or RoI-guided modes. In both cases, the same algorithm (named DsPhiPi) is used to combine the reconstructed tracks and search first for a \(\phi\) and then for a \(D_{s}^{\pm}\). In the RoI-guided approach tracks are reconstructed in a region \(\Delta\phi\times\Delta\eta=1.5\times 1.5\) around all jet RoIs with \(E_{T}\) above a certain programmable threshold [11]. A \(p_{T}\) cut of 1.4 GeV is applied to all reconstructed tracks.

Opposite sign track pairs are considered as a \(\phi\) candidate if they pass the following cuts: \(|\Delta z|<3\) mm, where \(z\) is the distance along the beam line of the track's point of closest approach to the centre of the detector, \(|\Delta\phi|<0.2\) and \(|\Delta\eta|<0.2\).

The tracks are combined using a \(K\) mass hypothesis and a cut around the \(\phi\) mass \(m_{\phi}(\text{PDG})=1019.46\) MeV [8] is applied. Track pairs passing the cut are then combined with all other tracks assuming a \(\pi\) mass for the third track. An event is selected if the mass of the track triplet is close to the \(D_{s}^{\pm}\) mass \(m_{D_{s}}(\text{PDG})=1968.2\) MeV. The mass cuts used are 1005 \(\text{\,MeV}<m_{KK}<1035\)\(\text{\,MeV}\) for the \(\phi\) candidates and 1908 \(\text{\,MeV}<m_{KK\pi}<2028\)\(\text{\,MeV}\) for the \(D_{s}\) candidates.

The LVL2 track fit masses are shown in Figure 3 and Table 4 for the RoI-guided approach and FullScan. The standard deviations obtained from the Gaussian fits show that the mass cuts used correspond to 3.0 standard deviations for the \(\phi\) mass distribution and 2.8 standard deviations for the \(D_{s}^{\pm}\) mass distribution [9]. The results for the RoI-based approach and those for FullScan agree well.

The acceptances of possible trigger strategies up to LVL2 are given in Table 5 for the signal samples and in Table 6 for the background datasets. The LVL2 trigger rates for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel are expected to be lower by a few percent since the average \(p_{T}\) of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates and consequently the average \(p_{T}\) of the \(D_{s}\) candidates is smaller for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel than for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel due to different track selections (see Fig. 5 and Section 5.1).

### Event Filter Selection

The muon confirmation at the Event Filter (EF) employs a muon track reconstruction algorithm using muon detector data only, similar to the algorithm used for offline reconstruction.

The EF \(D_{s}^{\pm}\) selection is very similar to that at LVL2. The track reconstruction can be performed in

Table 5: Acceptances of LVL2 (RoI and FullScan, FS) for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) sample for trigger menus A and B.

FullScan or RoI-guided modes, which share a common EF signature. The search for \(\phi\) and \(D_{s}^{\pm}\) particles currently uses the same mass cuts as at LVL2, even though better mass resolutions are expected for the EF than for LVL2. In the future the mass cuts might be tightened and additional selection cuts will be added as discussed in section 3.5. EF output rates, which are only available for the minimum bias sample, are discussed in the following subsections.

### Trigger Strategies for Early Running

At the lowest luminosities (\(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and \(10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)), the trigger selection needs to be as efficient as possible, which means running a loose trigger. To estimate rates and perform timing studies a trigger menu with a different set of muon thresholds [12] is applied to the minimum bias sample. Table 7 shows the expected trigger rates for muons at LVL1 and after confirmation at LVL2. The output rates of the DsPhiPi trigger at LVL2 and the EF are given in Table 8 for \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). For a luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) and higher, the rates are expected to increase because of event pile-up and cavern background events.

In addition to the overall allowed output rate, the time constraints of the HLT system are limiting the DsPhiPi trigger. The maximum allowed average computing times are 40 ms at LVL2 and 1 s at the EF. Most of the time is taken in the tracking algorithms as can be seen in Table 9 which shows the average CPU time used by the tracking and hypothesis algorithms at LVL2 and EF.

Table 10 summarises the LVL2 efficiencies and the expected numbers for \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}(\mu 4)\) events before and after the application of event selection cuts in the analysis as well as the estimated LVL2 and EF trigger rates for different luminosity scenarios and different trigger choices. The L2 and EF output rates shown in this table are deduced from the rate information given in Tables 7 and 8. The LVL2 muon trigger efficiency estimates presented in Table 10 are based on the LVL2 results obtained with the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}(\mu 4)\) sample shown in Table 5.

At \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), once the improvements discussed in Section 3.5 have been applied to the EF algorithms, it should be possible to run the FullScan-based trigger at the LVL1 4 GeV muon rate and to remain within the constraints given by available trigger resources. As the luminosity is increased to \(10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), we will need to raise the muon threshold for the FullScan-based trigger or to move to a

Rol-based trigger. However, the muon threshold should be kept as low as possible in order to achieve the highest possible trigger efficiency and to allow for as many \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) events as possible to pass. Compared to earlier publications like [13] the \(b\bar{b}\) cross-section as shown in [7] is at the upper limit of what is expected and therefore the muon rates are likely to be overestimated.

### Trigger Strategies for Running at \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\)

At \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) the trigger needs to remain as efficient as possible while operating within the constraints of the trigger system's resources. The EF output rate is expected to be about 10-20 Hz for \(B\)-physics.

The muon rates expected at LVL1 and LVL2 for different thresholds and luminosities are included in Table 7. The LVL2 muon rates are the input rates for the LVL2 tracking algorithms. Using the information on jet RoI multiplicities from Figure 2 and Table 3, the computing times from Table 9 and the muon rates in Table 7, trigger strategies are determined for different luminosities.

For a luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), a LVL1 trigger muon in combination with the RoI-based \(D_{s}\) trigger will be used. It is planned to use thresholds of 6 GeV for the trigger muon and 5 GeV for the jet RoI trigger. It is clear from Table 8 that in order to run such a trigger the LVL2 and EF selections will have to be tightened. This may be achieved by introducing vertex fitting and by reconstructing the \(B_{s}^{0}\) at the EF level.

Preliminary studies at LVL2 show that a requirement for a vertex fit to the 3 tracks of the \(D_{s}\) candidate can achieve a factor 2 rate reduction for a drop in efficiency from 38% to 32%. This estimate is applied to cells marked by \({}^{\#}\) and \({}^{\dagger}\) in Table 10. Also, it might be an option to further reduce the rate by tightening

the acceptance windows for \(m_{\phi}\) and \(m_{D_{s}}\) on LVL2, but the resulting rate reduction and the expected signal efficiency loss will need to be studied.

A considerable rate reduction at the EF level may be achieved by reconstructing the \(B^{0}_{s}\). A preliminary study using offline selection cuts (see Section 5.1), which have been relaxed to simulate wider mass window and vertexing requirements for the reconstructed particles, has been performed with the \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 4X\) and \(c\bar{c}\to\mu 4X\) samples. The resulting rate reduction factor, estimated to be approximately 60, is applied to cells marked by \({}^{\ddagger}\) in Table 10. According to this study, the overall trigger and reconstruction efficiency for the \(B^{0}_{s}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) signal events will be reduced by about 55%. Although these estimates will need to be confirmed by an implementation of a simplified \(B^{0}_{s}\) reconstruction at the EF level, reasonable EF output rates are expected to be achievable.

The numbers of expected \(B^{0}_{s}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}(\mu 4)\) events for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data for a luminosity of \(10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) are given in Table 10. It will be necessary to establish a muon trigger threshold as low as possible to maximise the signal event yield.

### Trigger Strategies for Higher Luminosities

As luminosity increases, it is necessary to stay within the limits of the LVL2 trigger processing times and allowable output rates. As Table 10 shows, this will require increasing the muon threshold to 8 GeV or 10 GeV and to add additional trigger elements in the EF as discussed at the end of Section 3.5. Another

Rates set in _italics_ are estimates based on the interpolated and extrapolated rates given in Table 7. LVL2 output rates marked by \({}^{\dagger}\) are downscaled by a factor two, the estimated rate reduction for a \(D_{s}\) vertex requirement at LVL2. For EF output rates marked by \({}^{\ddagger}\), an estimated rate reduction factor of 60 accounting for EF \(B^{0}_{s}\) reconstruction is applied. (See section 3.5 for details.) The results in the columns “LVL2 eff.” and \(N_{LVL2\ output}^{B^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}}\) (without and with selection cuts applied) are based on the \(B^{0}_{s}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}(\mu 4)\) Monte Carlo data sample. Numbers marked by \({}^{\#}\) are corrected for the estimated efficiency loss by a \(D_{s}\) vertex requirement at LVL2. The integrated luminosities and expected event numbers correspond to one year running at the given instantaneous luminosity (\(10^{7}\) seconds).

option, however a less efficient one, is to prescale the 6 GeV rate before running the track reconstruction.

## 4 Flavour Tagging

The measurement of \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations needs the knowledge of the flavour of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson at production time and at decay time in order to classify events as mixed or not mixed. The tagging algorithm tries to determine the flavour at production time, whereas the decay particles of the signal \(B_{s}^{0}\) determine the flavour at decay time. In this analysis soft muon tagging (see B-physics chapter of [4]) is used and the general application on the simulated data samples is shown in Section 4.2 without applying trigger conditions or any selection cut. Tagging results specific for the hadronic channels under investigation including trigger and selection cuts for \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates are given in Section 5.3.

### Soft Muon Tagging

In proton-proton collisions \(b\) quarks are produced in pairs leaving the signal \(B_{s}^{0}\) and the opposite side \(b\) hadron with the opposite flavour. In the case of a semileptonic decay as shown in Fig. 4, the charge of the produced lepton is correlated with the flavour of the signal \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson at production time. The charge of the muon with the highest reconstructed \(p_{T}\) is used for the determination of the flavour. Because of the muon trigger, in hadronic \(B_{s}^{0}\) decay channels soft muon tagging has a high tagging efficiency \(\epsilon_{tag}=N_{tag}/N_{all}\) limited by the muon reconstruction efficiency. Details on the aspects of muon reconstruction and identification in ATLAS can be found in [14].

The dilution factor is defined as \(D_{tag}=\frac{N_{c}-N_{w}}{N_{c}+N_{w}}\) where \(N_{c}\) is the number of events correctly tagged and \(N_{w}\) is the number of events with a wrong tag. These wrong tags arise from mixing of the tagging \(b\) hadron, muons from decays \(b\to c\to\mu\), additional \(c\) pairs and various particles decaying into muons. The wrong tag fraction \(\omega=N_{w}/(N_{c}+N_{w})\) is the ratio of wrongly tagged events to all tagged events. As the generation of the simulated data does not include \(B\) meson oscillations, mixing of the tagging side hadron is introduced artificially using the integrated mixing probabilities \(\chi_{d}\) and \(\chi_{s}\)[8]:

\[\chi_{d}=\frac{\Gamma(B_{d}^{0}\to\bar{B_{d}^{0}}\to\mu^{+}X)}{\Gamma(B_{d}^{ 0}\to\mu^{\pm}X)}=0.188\pm 0.003\qquad\chi_{s}=\frac{\Gamma(B_{s}^{0}\to\bar{B_{s}^{0}} \to\mu^{+}X)}{\Gamma(B_{s}^{0}\to\mu^{\pm}X)}=0.499\,24\pm 0.000\,03\]

### Application to Signal Samples

In Fig. 5 the transverse momentum of the signal \(B_{s}^{0}\) mesons is compared for the two \(B_{s}^{0}\) decay channels, the vertical lines show the mean values of the two distributions. This difference arises from the different kinematical configuration due to the condition on all charged final state particles \(p_{T}>0.5\) GeV at Monte Carlo generation. As \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) has a total number of six final state particles, the mean transverse

Figure 4: In the case of a signal \(B_{s}^{0}\), the associated opposite side \(b\) hadron decaying semileptonically produces a negatively charged lepton.

momentum of the signal \(B_{s}^{0}\) is higher compared to \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) with a total number of four final state particles. The difference in the \(B_{s}^{0}\) transverse momentum spectrum is also expected at offline reconstruction level due to the different \(p_{T}\) selection cuts for the \(\pi\) and the \(a_{1}\) combinations (see Section 5.1). This leads in the case of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) sample to an overall wrong tag fraction of \(\omega=20.29\pm 0.14\) % and in the case of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel to a wrong tag fraction \(\omega=21.05\pm 0.11\) %, which is higher compared to the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel (see all events in Table 11 in Section 5.3).

In Fig. 6 the wrong tag fractions and the sources of these wrong tags are compared for both \(B_{s}^{0}\) decays channels. The wrong tag fraction is shown as a function of the tagging muon's transverse momentum \(p_{T}(\mu)\), in Fig. 6(a) for \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and in Fig. 6(b) for \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\). In the regime \(p_{T}(\mu)<11\) GeV the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) wrong tag fraction is higher. As mentioned above this difference arises from the different track selections of the two decay channels. In both channels the two main sources of wrong tags are mixing of neutral \(B\) mesons on the tagging side and muons from cascade decays \(b\to c\to\mu\). As the overall wrong tag fraction is decreasing with the muon \(p_{T}\), also the part with a wrong tag due to the cascade \(b\to c\to\mu\) is decreasing at the same rate. A further source of mistags are additional \(c\bar{c}\)-pairs. The wrong tag fraction of this part stays about constant with increasing \(p_{T}(\mu)\). A small part of the wrong tag fraction originates from \(J/\psi\), \(\phi\), \(\rho\), \(\eta\) or \(\tau\) particles decaying into muons. Additional sources like muons from kaons and pions or hadrons misidentified as muons can be neglected [12].

A \(b\bar{b}\) pair produced in proton proton collisions has a transverse momentum equal to zero at first order. Going through fragmentation and hadronisation, the \(p_{T}\) of the signal \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson and the opposite side \(b\) hadron are still correlated, and therefore a muon coming from a semileptonic decay of the \(b\) hadron also is correlated with the signal \(B_{s}^{0}\). Hence a muon from a cascade \(b\to c\to\mu\) is more likely to pass the LVL1 muon trigger when \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson has a higher \(p_{T}\), leading to the increase in wrong tag fraction with \(p_{T}(B_{s}^{0})\). This behaviour is shown in the Fig. 6(c) and 6(d).

Figure 6: Wrong tag fraction as functions of tagging muons transverse momentum \(p_{T}(\mu)\) in (a) and (b) and wrong tag fractions as functions of signal Monte Carlos \(B_{s}^{0}\) transverse momentum \(p_{T}(B_{s}^{0})\) in (c) and (d). The wrong tag fraction is shown with mixing of the tagging side \(b\) hadron and without mixing. Without mixing, the different sources of wrong tags are shown. The main contribution is coming from \(b\to c\to\mu\) followed by additional \(c\) pairs. Additional sources shown are muons coming from \(J/\psi\), \(\phi\), \(\rho\), \(\eta\) and \(\tau\).

### Systematic Uncertainties of Soft Muon Tagging

The calibration of the soft muon tagger will be done with events from the exclusive decay channel \(B^{+}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})K^{+}\). The high branching ratio and the simple event topology allows the measurement of this channel during the initial luminosity phase at the LHC. Without mixing on the signal side, these events can be used to estimate the systematic uncertainties of soft muon tagging.

For an integrated luminosity of 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) 160 000 events of the decay channel \(B^{+}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})K^{+}\) are expected [15] at ATLAS. About 13.5 % events are estimated to have an additional third muon for flavour tagging. Requiring a minimum transverse momentum of 6  GeV for this additional muon, the number of events will be reduced by a factor of three. Assuming that the wrong tag fraction in this channel behaves like in the hadronic \(B_{s}^{0}\) decay channels, the expected statistical error of the wrong tag fraction would be of the order of 0.1 % for 1 fb\({}^{-1}\) integrated luminosity.

## 5 Event Selection

For the following analysis selecting \(B_{s}\) candidates the default trigger choices are to require MU06 and JT04 trigger elements at LVL1 and to perform a search for the \(D_{s}\to\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\pi\) decay within a jet RoI at LVL2. Resulting event numbers and plots are given for 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) unless indicated otherwise.

### Signal Event Reconstruction

For the reconstruction of the \(B_{s}\) vertex only tracks with a pseudo-rapidity \(|\eta|<2.5\) are used proceeding via the following steps. The \(\phi\) decay vertex is first reconstructed by considering all pairs of oppositely-charged tracks with \(p_{T}>1.5\) GeV for both tracks. Kinematic cuts on the angles between the two tracks, \(\Delta\varphi_{KK}<10^{\circ}\) and \(\Delta\theta_{KK}<10^{\circ}\), are imposed, where \(\varphi\) denotes the azimuthal angle and \(\theta\) the polar angle. The two-track vertex is then fitted assigning the kaon mass to both tracks. Combinations passing a fit-probability cut [16] of 1% (\(\simeq\chi^{2}\)/dof = 7/1) with the invariant mass within three standard deviations of the nominal \(\phi\) mass are selected as \(\phi\) candidates. The plots in Fig. 7 show the invariant mass distribution for all \(m_{KK}\) combinations overlaid with the \(\phi\) candidates matching a generated \(\phi\) from the signal decay (grey filled area) fitted with a single Gaussian function. For the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel the mass resolution is \(\sigma_{\phi}=(4.30\pm 0.03)\) MeV and for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel \(\sigma_{\phi}=(4.28\pm 0.03)\) MeV. This mass window for accepted \(\phi\) candidates is shown by the vertical lines. No trigger selections are applied for the mass plots shown in Fig. 7 to Fig. 9.

From the remaining tracks, a third track with \(p_{T}>1.5\) GeV is added to all accepted \(\phi\) candidates. The pion mass is assigned to the third track and a three-track vertex is fitted. Three-track vertex candidates which have a fit probability greater than 1% (\(\simeq\chi^{2}\)/dof = 12/3) and an invariant mass within three standard deviations of the nominal \(D_{s}\) mass are selected as \(D_{s}\) candidates. The plots in Fig. 8 show the invariant mass distribution for all \(m_{KK\pi}\) combinations overlaid with the \(D_{s}\) candidates matching a generated \(D_{s}\) from the signal decay (grey filled area) fitted with a single Gaussian function. For the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel the mass resolution is \(\sigma_{D_{s}}=17.81\pm 0.13\) MeV and for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel \(\sigma_{D_{s}}=17.92\pm 0.13\) MeV. The \(3\sigma_{D_{s}}\) mass range for accepted \(D_{s}\) candidates is shown by the vertical lines.

For the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel a search is performed for \(a_{1}^{\pm}\) candidates using three-particle combinations of charged tracks for events with a reconstructed \(D_{s}\) meson. In a first step \(\rho^{0}\) mesons are reconstructed from all combinations of two tracks with opposite charges and with \(p_{T}>0.5\) GeV, each particle in the combination being assigned a pion mass. A kinematic cut \(\Delta R_{\pi\pi}=\sqrt{\Delta\phi_{\pi\pi}^{2}+\Delta\eta_{\pi\pi}^{2}}<0.650\) is used to reduce the combinatorial background. The two selected tracks are then fitted as originating from the same vertex; from the combinations passing a fit probability cut of 1% (\(\simeq\chi^{2}\)/dof = 7/1), those with an invariant mass within 400 MeV of the nominal \(\rho^{0}\) mass are selected as \(\rho^{0}\) candidates. Next a third track with \(p_{T}>0.5\) GeV from the remaining charged tracks is added to the \(\rho^{0}\) candidate, assuming thepion hypothesis for the extra track. A kinematic cut \(\Delta R_{\rho\pi}<0.585\) is applied. The three tracks are fitted to a common vertex without any mass constraints. Combinations with a fit probability greater than 1% (\(\simeq\chi^{2}/\)dof = 12/3) and with an invariant mass within 325 MeV of the nominal \(a_{1}\) mass are selected as \(a_{1}^{\pm}\) candidates.

The \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates are reconstructed combining the \(D_{s}^{\pm}\) candidates with \(a_{1}^{\pm}\) candidates with opposite charge and different tracks. A six-track vertex fit is performed with mass constraints for the tracks from \(\phi\) and \(D_{s}\); due to the large \(a_{1}\) natural width the three tracks from the \(a_{1}\) are not constrained to the \(a_{1}\) mass. The total momentum of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) vertex is required to point to the primary vertex and the momentum of the \(D_{s}\) vertex to the \(B_{s}^{0}\) vertex. Only six-track combinations with a vertex fit probability greater than 1% (\(\simeq\chi^{2}/\)dof = 27/12) are considered as \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates.

For the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel for each reconstructed \(D_{s}\) meson a fourth track from the remaining tracks in the event is added. This track is required to have opposite charge with respect to the pion track from the \(D_{s}\) and \(p_{T}>1\) GeV. The four-track decay vertex is fitted including \(\phi\) and \(D_{s}\) mass constraints, and requiring that the total momentum of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) vertex points to the primary vertex and the momentum of \(D_{s}\) vertex points to the \(B_{s}^{0}\) vertex. In order to be selected as \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates, the four-track combinations are required to have a vertex fit probability greater than 1% (\(\simeq\chi^{2}/\)dof = 20/8).

For both channels, \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\), the signed separation between the reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) vertex and the primary vertex is required to be positive (the momentum should not point backward to the parent vertex). To improve the purity of the sample, further cuts are imposed: the proper decay time of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) has to be greater than 0.4 ps, the \(B_{s}^{0}\) impact parameter (shortest distance of the reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) trajectory from the primary vertex in the transverse plane to the reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) decay vertex) is required to be smaller than 55 \(\mu\)m and \(p_{T}\) of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) must be larger than 10 GeV. The plot in Fig. 9(a) shows the invariant mass distribution for all \(m_{KK\pi\pi}\)\(B_{s}\) candidates matching a generated \(B_{s}\) from the signal decay for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel fitted with a single Gaussian function and giving a mass resolution of \(\sigma_{B_{s}}=52.80\pm 0.68\) MeV. For the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel Fig. 9(b) shows the invariant mass distribution for all \(m_{KK\pi\pi\pi\pi}\)\(B_{s}\) candidates matching a generated \(B_{s}\) and giving a mass resolution of \(\sigma_{B_{s}}=40.82\pm 0.53\) MeV. The difference in the \(B_{s}^{0}\) mass resolutions is caused by the \(p_{T}\) spectrum of the \(\pi\) in the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) decay being harder than the \(p_{T}\) spectra of the three pions in the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) decay, as the pion momentum resolution is worse for higher \(p_{T}\). A final mass cut of two standard deviations on the \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates is applied for further analysis (see vertical lines in Fig. 9). For some events more than one \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidate is reconstructed and in that case the candidate with the lowest \(\chi^{2}/\)dof from the vertex fit is selected for further analysis.

No relevant effects induced by the trigger selections on fit variables of the mass plots or the kinematic distributions of the \(B_{s}\) candidates are found (discussed in Section 6.3). All differences are within the fit errors.

### Background Channels

Two main sources of background are considered: irreducible background coming from a decay channel that closely mimics the \(B_{s}^{0}\) signal and combinatorial background coming from random combination of tracks.

#### 5.2.1 Exclusive Background Channels

The exclusive samples listed in Table 1 are used as irreducible background sources. See Table 12 in Section 6 for the numbers of reconstructed candidates after applying the same selection cuts as for the signal samples. The histograms in Fig. 10 show the invariant mass spectrum of reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel respectively (no trigger selection cut applied). The different contributions are scaled with the cross-section given in Table 1.

Figure 8: Reconstructed mass \(m_{KK\pi}\) for all combinations within the signal sample (black line) and \(KK\pi\) candidates corresponding to a \(D_{s}\) particle from the signal decay in the Monte Carlo truth information (grey filled). The standard deviation obtained from a fit within two standard deviations of a Gaussian function (dashed) to the distribution defines the three standard deviation cut range (vertical dashed). No trigger conditions are applied.

Figure 7: Reconstructed mass \(m_{KK}\) for all combinations within the signal sample (black line) and \(KK\) candidates corresponding to a \(\phi\) particle from the signal decay in the Monte Carlo truth information (grey filled). The standard deviation obtained from a fit within two standard deviations of a Gaussian function (dashed) to the distribution defines the three standard deviation cut range (vertical dashed). No trigger conditions are applied.

Figure 10: \(m_{KK\pi\pi}\) (a) and \(m_{KK\pi\pi\pi\pi}\) (b) reconstructed mass for signal and background channels. In (b) the upper limit for the branching fraction of the channel \(B_{d}\to D_{s}a_{1}\) is used.

Figure 9: \(m_{KK\pi\pi}\) (a) and \(m_{KK\pi\pi\pi\pi}\) (b) reconstructed mass and fit of a Gaussian function to the distribution. Each \(KK\pi\pi\) (\(KK\pi\pi\pi\pi\pi\)) candidate displayed corresponds to a \(B_{s}\) particle in the Monte Carlo truth information. The two standard deviation cut range is shown by the vertical dashed lines. No trigger chain applied.

In the case of \(B_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{+}a_{1}^{-}\), there is no measurement of the branching fraction available. The current upper limit is therefore used as a conservative estimate. The similarity to the \(B_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{+}\pi^{-}\) channel indicates that the \(B_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{+}a_{1}^{-}\) cross section could be in the same order as the one of the \(B_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{+}\pi^{-}\) channel and therefore the \(B_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{+}a_{1}^{-}\) contribution in Fig. 10 (b) could be much smaller.

The \(B_{s}\to D_{s}^{*}\pi\) and \(B_{s}\to D_{s}^{*}a_{1}\) channels are treated as a background source, since the momentum and hence the lifetime estimation for this decay is flawed due to the missing photon from the decay of the \(D_{s}^{*}\).

#### 5.2.2 Combinatorial Background

The limited statistics of the combinatorial background samples (e.g. 242 150 events for \(b\bar{b}\to\mu 6X\)) do not allow us to give a reasonable estimate for the signal to background ratio. This ratio as well as kinematic properties of the combinatorial background, like the shape of the proper time distribution will be studied once early data are available.

### Tagging Results

Soft muon tagging is applied on all available simulated data of the two hadronic signal channels \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\). Table 11 shows the number of events, the tagging efficiency and the wrong tag fractions. The tagging efficiency corresponds to the fraction of events where muon candidates have been successfully reconstructed. The events with at least one muon are separated into events with a good tag and events with a wrong tag resulting in a wrong tag fraction.

Comparing the results for all simulated events between the two signal channels, the difference in the wrong tag fraction is of the order 1 % due to the different kinematical topology. As the RoI trigger applies a \(p_{T}\) cut of 1.4 \(\,\mathrm{\,Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) on all reconstructed tracks, low \(p_{T}\)\(B_{s}^{0}\) mesons are rejected leading to an increased wrong tag fraction for the triggered events (see Fig. 6(c) and 6(d)). After event reconstruction overall wrong tag fractions of \(\omega=22.30^{+0.56}_{-0.55}\) % for the channel \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(\omega=23.31^{+0.56}_{-0.55}\) % for the channel \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) are observed. Effects of mixing are included as described in Section 4.1.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline Process & Type of & Number of & Tagging & Wrong Tag \\  & Events & Events & Efficiency [\%] & Fraction [\%] \\ \hline \hline \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) & all events & 88450 & \(96.08\pm 0.07\) & \(20.29\pm 0.14\) \\  & triggered & 21613 & \(98.77\pm 0.07\) & \(22.96\pm 0.29\) \\  & reconstructed & 5687 & \(98.79^{+0.14}_{-0.15}\) & \(22.30^{+0.56}_{-0.55}\) \\ \hline \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) & all events & 98450 & \(95.93\pm 0.06\) & \(21.05\pm 0.13\) \\  & triggered & 27118 & \(98.55\pm 0.07\) & \(23.91\pm 0.26\) \\  & reconstructed & 5757 & \(98.47^{+0.16}_{-0.17}\) & \(23.31^{+0.56}_{-0.55}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 11: Tagging efficiencies and wrong tag fractions for the signal channels \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) are shown for three different stages: all simulated events, all triggered events passing the LVL1 muon trigger and the LVL2 RoI trigger, and finally the numbers for the reconstructed events. The errors are statistical only.

Determination of \(\Delta m_{s}\)

### Methods for the Determination of \(\Delta m_{s}\) and its Measurement Limits

For the determination of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillation frequency the maximum likelihood method is used. The likelihood \({\cal L}\) is a function of the proper time \(t\) and the mixing state \(\mu\), parametrised by \(\Delta m_{s}\) and \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\), applied to five classes of events simultaneously: mixed and unmixed \(B_{s}^{0}\), mixed and unmixed \(B_{d}^{0}\), and background with lifetime but no mixing. The \(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\) classes have characteristic wrong tag fractions \(\omega\), which are determined on event-by-event basis as described previously. By maximising the likelihood \({\cal L}\) for a given event sample one can then extract the model parameters.

For obtaining the \(5\,\sigma\) discovery and \(95\%\) exclusion measurement limits on \(\Delta m_{s}\) the amplitude fit method is used because the maximum likelihood method was found to have some disadvantages in that case [5]. The estimation of the maximum value of \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurable with the ATLAS detector is using \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates from the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) hadronic channels. The numbers of reconstructed events after applying the trigger selection (L1_MU06 and LVL2 RoI) and the \(B_{s}^{0}\) selection cuts as well as the expected numbers for an integrated luminosity of \(10\)\({\rm fb}^{-1}\)are given in Table 12 for all signal and background channels. The effective cross-sections for the various processes can be found in Table 1. Significant background comes from the \(\bar{B}_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}/a_{1}^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{*-}\pi^{+}/a_{1}^{+}\) channels, and from the combinatorial background. Due to limited sample size the estimation of the combinatorial background is very approximate.

The relative fractions of the signal and the background contributions will be determined by a fit of mass shape templates to the reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) mass distribution employing a wider mass window than used here for the final extraction of \(\Delta m_{s}\), similar to the method used by CDF [1]. The mass shape templates will be determined from Monte Carlo mass distributions of the individual channels. Uncertainties in the knowledge of the shapes will be taken into account as part of the systematical uncertainty.

### Construction of the Likelihood Function

The probability density to observe an initial \(B_{j}^{0}\) meson (\(j=d,\,s\)) decaying at time \(t_{0}\) after its creation as a \(\bar{B}_{j}^{0}\) meson is given by

\[p_{j}(t_{0},\,\mu_{0})\,=\,\frac{\Gamma_{j}^{2}-\left(\Delta\Gamma_{j}/2 \right)^{2}}{2\Gamma_{j}}\;{\rm e}^{-\Gamma_{j}t_{0}}\left(\cosh\frac{\Delta \Gamma_{j}\,t_{0}}{2}+\mu_{0}\cos(\Delta m_{j}t_{0})\right) \tag{1}\]

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|} \hline Process & Simulated & Rec. & Rec. events \\  & events & events & for \(10\)\({\rm fb}^{-1}\) \\ \hline \hline \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) & \(88\,450\) & \(5\,687\) & \(6\,657\) \\ \(B_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{+}\pi^{-}\) & \(43\,000\) & \(1\,814\) & \(99\) \\ \(B_{d}^{0}\to D^{-}\pi^{+}\) & \(41\,000\) & \(23\) & \(35\) \\ \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{*-}\pi^{+}\) & \(40\,500\) & \(495\) & \(1\,116\) \\ \hline \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) & \(98\,450\) & \(5\,757\) & \(3\,368\) \\ \(B_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{+}a_{1}^{-}\) & \(50\,000\) & \(1\,385\) & \(<2\,454\) \\ \(B_{d}^{0}\to D^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) & \(50\,000\) & \(49\) & \(36\) \\ \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{*-}a_{1}^{+}\) & \(100\,000\) & \(870\) & \(1\,052\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 12: Signal and background samples used for the study of \(B_{s}^{0}\)-\(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) oscillations and number of events as obtained from the analysis as well as expected numbers for an integrated luminosity of \(10\)\({\rm fb}^{-1}\).

where \(\Delta\Gamma_{j}=\Gamma_{\rm H}^{j}-\Gamma_{\rm L}^{j}\), \(\Gamma_{j}=(\Gamma_{\rm H}^{j}+\Gamma_{\rm L}^{j})/2\) and \(\mu_{0}=-1\).

For the unmixed case (an initial \(B_{j}^{0}\) meson decaying as a \(B_{j}^{0}\) meson at time \(t_{0}\)), the probability density is obtained by setting \(\mu_{0}=+1\) in Eq. 1. Here the small effects of CP violation are neglected. Unlike \(\Delta\Gamma_{d}\), which can be safely set to zero, the width difference \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\) in the \(B_{s}^{0}\)-\(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) system could be as much as 20% of the total width [17].

However, the above probability is modified by experimental effects. The probability as a function of \(\mu_{0}\) and the reconstructed proper time \(t\) is obtained as the convolution of \(p_{j}(t_{0},\,\mu_{0})\) with the proper time resolution \({\rm Res}_{j}(t\,|\,t_{0})\):

\[q_{j}(t,\mu_{0})=\frac{1}{N}\int_{0}^{\infty}p_{j}(t_{0},\mu_{0})\;{\rm Res}_{ j}(t\mid t_{0})\;{\rm d}t_{0} \tag{2}\]

with the normalisation factor

\[N=\int_{t_{\rm min}}^{\infty}(\int_{0}^{\infty}p_{j}(t^{\prime},\mu_{0})\;{\rm Res }_{j}(t\mid t^{\prime})\;{\rm d}t^{\prime})\;{\rm d}t\;. \tag{3}\]

Here \(t_{\rm min}\) = 0.4 ps is the cut on the \(B_{s}^{0}\) reconstructed proper decay time. Plots in Fig. 11 show the proper time resolutions, which are parametrised with the sum of two Gaussian functions around the same mean value. The widths from the fit are \(\sigma_{1}\) = (68.4\(\pm\)3.3) fs for the core fraction of 53.2% and \(\sigma_{2}\) = (157.2\(\pm\)5.7) fs for the rest of the tail part of the distribution for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel. The values for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel are \(\sigma_{1}\) = (72.5\(\pm\)4.3) fs for the core fraction of (58.0\(\pm\)6.8) % and \(\sigma_{2}\) = (144.7\(\pm\)7.3) fs for the tail part.

Assuming a fraction \(\omega_{j}\) of wrong tags occurring at production and/or decay, the probability becomes

\[\tilde{q}_{j}(t,\mu)=(1-\omega_{j})q_{j}(t,\mu)+\omega_{j}q_{j}(t,-\mu) \tag{4}\]

where \(\mu_{0}\) has been replaced by \(\mu\) in order to indicate that now we are talking about the experimental observation of same or opposite flavour tags. For each signal channel, the background is composed of oscillating \(B_{d}^{0}\) mesons, with probability given by Eq. 4, and of non-oscillating combinatorial background, with probability given by Eq. 5, which results from Eq. 1 and Eq. 4 by setting \(\Delta m=0\) and \(\Delta\Gamma=0\) :

\[{\rm p_{cb}}(t,\mu)=\;\frac{\Gamma_{\rm cb}}{2}\;{\rm e}^{-\Gamma_{\rm cb}t} \left[1+\mu\;(1-2\omega_{\rm cb})\right] \tag{5}\]

For a fraction \(f_{kj}\) of the \(j\) component (\(j=s,\,d,\) and combinatorial background cb) in the total sample of type \(k\), one obtains the probability density function

\[{\rm pdf}_{k}(t,\mu)=\sum_{j=s,d,{\rm cb}}f_{kj}\tilde{q}_{j}(t,\mu)\;. \tag{6}\]

The index \(k=1\) denotes the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel and \(k=2\) the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channel. The likelihood of the total event sample is written as

\[{\cal L}(\Delta m_{s},\Delta\Gamma_{s})=\prod_{k=1}^{N_{\rm cb}}\sum_{i=1}^{N_ {\rm ev}^{k}}{\rm pdf}_{k}(t_{i},\mu_{i}) \tag{7}\]

where \(N_{\rm ev}^{k}\) is the total number of events of type \(k\), and \(N_{\rm ch}=2\). Each pdf\({}_{k}\) is properly normalised to unity.

Figure 12 shows how the experimental effects, as parametrised in Eqs. 2, 4, and 6, modify the distribution of the proper time \(t\) of a Monte Carlo data sample.

Figure 12: A sequence of plots showing how a true \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillation signal with \(\Delta m_{s}^{\rm gen}\) = 17.77 ps\({}^{-1}\) (a) is diluted first by the effect of a finite proper time resolution (b) and then by adding background events and including the effect of wrong tags (c). The plots contain samples of events equivalent to 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) of integrated luminosity. They were generated using the Monte Carlo method described in Section 6.3. Only the case of mixed events is shown. For illustration a \(\chi^{2}\)-fit of the function \(C\exp(-t/\tau)(1-D\cos(\Delta m_{s}t))\) is overlaid to the solid histogram in (c), where \(D\) can be interpreted as the combined dilution factor: \(D\approx 0.1\) here. Note that this is different from the unbinned maximum likelihood fit to the total event sample of mixed and unmixed events which is actually used to derive results in this study. The dashed histogram in (c) describes the contribution from all background sources.

far from the true value. A five standard deviation measurement limit is defined as the value of \(\Delta m_{s}\) for which \(1/\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}=5\), and a sensitivity at 95% C.L. as the value of \(\Delta m_{s}\) for which \(1/\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}=1.645\). Limits are computed with the statistical uncertainty \(\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}^{\mathrm{stat}}\). A detailed investigation on the systematic uncertainties \(\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}^{\mathrm{syst}}\), which affects the measurement of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillation, is presented in [18].

### Extraction of the \(\Delta m_{s}\) Sensitivity

For the nominal set of parameters (as defined in the previous sections), \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}=0\) and an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), the amplitude \(\pm 1\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}^{\mathrm{stat}}\) is plotted as a function of \(\Delta m_{s}\) in Fig. 17(a). The 95% C.L. sensitivity to measure \(\Delta m_{s}\) is found to be 29.6 ps\({}^{-1}\). This value is given by the intersection of the dashed line, corresponding to 1.645 \(\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}^{\mathrm{stat}}\), with the horizontal line at \(\mathcal{A}=1\).

From Fig. 17(b), which shows the significance of the measurement \(S(\Delta m_{s})=1/\sigma_{\mathcal{A}}\) as a function of \(\Delta m_{s}\), the 5\(\sigma\) measurement limit is found to 20.5 ps\({}^{-1}\).

The dependence of the \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement limits on the integrated luminosity is shown in Fig. 18(a), with the numerical values given in Table 13.

The dependence of the \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement limits on \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}/\Gamma_{s}\) is determined for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\), other parameters having their nominal value. The \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}/\Gamma_{s}\) is used as a fixed parameter in the amplitude fit method. As shown in Fig. 18(b) no sizeable effect is seen up to \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}/\Gamma_{s}\sim 30\%\).

### Extraction of the \(\Delta m_{s}\) Measurement Precision

Whereas the \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement limits are obtained by using the amplitude method (see previous section), in case of the presence of an oscillation signal in the data the value of the oscillation frequency \(\Delta m_{s}\) and its precision are determined by minimising the likelihood (given by Eq. 7) with respect to \(\Delta m_{s}\). In this fit \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\) is fixed to 0, because a study has shown that the systematic uncertainties resulting from varying \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}/\Gamma_{s}\) in the range 0 to 0.2 (suggested by the present uncertainty) are practically negligible.

An example of the likelihood function is given in Fig. 19(a), in which the \(\Delta m_{s}^{\mathrm{gen}}\) in the Monte Carlo sample has been set to the value measured by CDF for illustration. From this type of graphs the precision

### Discussion of Results

In this note it is shown that with an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) ATLAS is able to verify the CDF measurement of \(\Delta m_{s}=(17.77\pm 0.10\,({\rm stat})\pm 0.07\,({\rm sys}))\,{\rm ps}^{-1}\) at the five standard deviation level. For these parameters the statistical error on \(\Delta m_{s}\) is calculated to be about 0.065 ps\({}^{-1}\).

In a preceding study [18] it was found that over a wide range of values for \(\Delta m_{s}\) and integrated luminosity the systematic uncertainty on the measured value of \(\Delta m_{s}\) was smaller by at least a factor of 10 compared to the statistical uncertainty. The list of contributions to that systematic error estimation included the wrong tag fraction with a relative error of 5% compared to 2.5% found in this study. For the reasons mentioned above, the evaluation of systematic effects has not been repeated here. The study of the effect of varying \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\) (as explained in the previous section) is new, but the contribution to the systematic uncertainty is also very small.

Systematic uncertainties on the overall trigger efficiencies mainly effect the statistics available for the analysis. However, an important systematic effect for the \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement would be introduced in case different trigger efficiencies for positively and negatively charged muons are observed. In order to constrain this effect, dimuon events from a calibration channel like \(B^{+}\to J/\psi\,K^{+}\) with \(J/\psi\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) which are triggered by a single muon trigger could be used.

Clearly LHCb can measure \(\Delta m_{s}\) more precisely than ATLAS (\(\sigma_{\rm stat}(\Delta m_{s})\sim 0.01\) ps\({}^{-1}\) with 2 fb\({}^{-1}\) of data [19]), but the \(\Delta m_{s}\) measurement with ATLAS is needed for the simultaneous fit of all parameters of the weak sector of the \(B^{0}_{s}\)-\(\bar{B}^{0}_{s}\) system (weak mixing phase \(\phi_{s}\), \(\Delta m_{s}\), \(\Gamma_{s}\) and \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\)). This will be performed by

## 7 Summary and Conclusions

We have studied the capabilities of the ATLAS detector to measure \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations in \(pp\) collisions at 14 TeV using the purely hadronic decay channels \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\pi^{-})\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}(\phi\pi^{-})a_{1}^{+}\). For an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) a \(\Delta m_{s}\) sensitivity limit of 29.6 ps\({}^{-1}\) and a five standard deviation measurement limit of 20.5 ps\({}^{-1}\) is obtained from a likelihood fit employing the amplitude fit method. This result depends only weakly on the lifetime difference \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\). The trigger is based on a single muon trigger with adjustable muon \(p_{T}\) thresholds between 4 and 10 GeV on all trigger levels and an active search for \(D_{s}\to\phi\pi\) decays by the High Level Trigger. For \(10^{31}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) we will be able to afford a muon trigger with the loosest \(p_{T}\) threshold combined with a FullScan \(D_{s}\to\phi\pi\) search. For \(10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\), we will need to increase the muon \(p_{T}\) threshold to 6 GeV and possibly employ the RoI-based LVL2 trigger. In both cases, the trigger rates can be kept at an acceptable level. For higher luminosities, we need to implement additional constraints in the HLT in order to reduce the event output rates further.

The offline event reconstruction searches for the hadronic decay of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) and requires a muon with a minimum \(p_{T}\) of 6 GeV for each event. While the flavour of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) at decay time is determined from the charge of the \(D_{s}\) particle, the identification of the initial \(B_{s}^{0}\) flavour at production time is extracted from the charge of the soft muon in the event, taking effects of \(B_{s}^{0}\) mixing into account. An overall tagging efficiency of \(98.8\pm 0.2\%\) and \(98.5\pm 0.2\%\) as well as average wrong tag fractions of \(22.3\pm 0.6\%\) and \(23.3\pm 0.6\%\) for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channels, respectively, are obtained.

About 100 000 Monte Carlo events of each sample have been produced without \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations. Monte Carlo events for several exclusive \(B_{s}^{0}\) and \(B_{d}^{0}\) background channels as well as for inclusive background like \(b\bar{b}\to\mu X\) and \(c\bar{c}\to\mu X\) have been used. The hadronic decay of the signal side \(B_{s}^{0}\) is reconstructed constraining the masses of intermediate particles in the decay chain. A \(B_{s}^{0}\) mass resolution of \(52.8\pm 0.7\) MeV and \(40.8\pm 0.5\) MeV is obtained and after the application of all analysis cuts, 6657 and 3 368 events are expected for an integrated luminosity of 10 fb\({}^{-1}\) for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) decay channels, respectively. We have considered several exclusive background channels, contributing to the background inside the \(B_{s}^{0}\) mass window. The \(B_{d}^{0}\to D^{-}\pi^{+}/a_{1}^{+}\) channels hardly contribute (percent level of the signal), but the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{+-}\pi^{+}/a_{1}^{+}\) make a considerable contribution of about 16% (\(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\)) and 31% (\(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\)). While the \(B_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) channel is expected to contribute with about 1.5% relative to the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) signal, we can only estimate the \(B_{d}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) contribution to be less than about 70% of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) signal, given that this decay channel has not yet been observed.

In future, the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}/a_{1}^{+}\) channels may be considered signal rather than background. An estimate of the combinatorial background is severely limited by the available Monte Carlo event statistics. We plan to use early data to obtain a realistic estimate. For an integrated luminosity of 100 pb\({}^{-1}\) at \(10^{32}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) we only expect about 90 events in the \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}\pi^{+}\) and \(B_{s}^{0}\to D_{s}^{-}a_{1}^{+}\) channels, while the \(B^{+}\to J/\psi(\mu\mu)K^{+}\) decay channel, which has a large branching ratio, may be used to calibrate the soft muon tagging with early data. On LVL2 the processing time for the \(D_{s}\to\phi\pi\) trigger may be reduced by restricting the track reconstruction to Regions of Interest (RoI), seeded by a LVL1 jet energy trigger. This typically leads to a reduction of the trigger efficiency by a few percent. At an instantaneous luminosity of \(2\cdot 10^{33}\) cm\({}^{-2}\)s\({}^{-1}\) several options will be considered to achieve acceptable Event Filter output rates. Besides further constraining the mass windows of the \(D_{s}\to\phi\pi\) trigger, other improvements are obtained by checking for a good reconstruction quality of the \(D_{s}\) vertex or the implementation of a trigger element in the Event Filter which searches for the full \(B_{s}^{0}\) decay chain. However, there is an uncertainty of a factor two in the overall \(b\bar{b}\) cross-section at the centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV and therefore the trigger rates may vary.

Due to the achieved sensitivity limit to measure the \(B_{s}^{0}\) oscillations we expect to be able to verify the CDF measurement of \(\Delta m_{s}=17.77\pm 0.10\,(\mathrm{stat})\pm 0.07\,(\mathrm{sys})\) ps\({}^{-1}\) at the five standard deviation level with a statistical error on \(\Delta m_{s}\) of about 0.065 ps\({}^{-1}\). This will provide a reasonable precision which allows us to combine the measurement described in this note with the analysis of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) channel [20] in a simultaneous fit for all parameters of the weak sector of the \(B_{s}^{0}\)-\(\bar{B}_{s}^{0}\) system.
