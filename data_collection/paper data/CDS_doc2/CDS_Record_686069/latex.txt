In this note, we describe the lead thickness measurements that have been performed on the lead plates to be used for the construction of a model and for the 1995 barrel electromagnetic calorimeter prototype. We give the analysis results and discuss some criteria to accept or reject a plate.

Introduction

It is well known that the knowledge of the thickness of the lead used to build the absorbers is a key point to achieve the resolutions ATLAS needs for its electromagnetic calorimetry. Indeed, a variation of only 10 microns in lead thickness induces a change of about 1% in the resolution of the calorimeter, so that this thickness has to be monitored carefully.

## 2 Choice of measurement technique

There are several possible techniques to measure the thickness of a lead plate. The simplest one is to simply weigh the plate and, knowing the dimensions and the density of the plate, one can easily extract the thickness. This operation is very easy to perform, but it gives of course only access to the average thickness. In addition, it requires the dimensions of the plates to be known with high precision.

An other method is to use a laser beam that gets reflected with a small angle on the plate surface (see figure 1). This technique is conceptually simple, but there are several practical difficulties :

* The displacement of the beam source must be perfectly parallel to the plate.
* One may not only measure the plate thickness itself, but one is sensitive to gaps between the plate and the table that carries it. (see figure 2). These difficulties lead to seek for a method that could present the same advantages with possibly less difficulties.

We have chosen to measure the lead thickness using ultrasonic control for several reasons :

* It is easy to implement, since the apparatus used is small. This will be a big advantage when the controls will have to be done during manufacturing.
* An advantage that the laser method already had is that one needs only access to one face of the plate. This makes the implementation of ultrasonic control in an automated measuring machine easy in a later stage.
* It is possible to study local deformations of the plates, in addition to the average thickness.

The apparatus we have used sends 15 MHz waves through the plate to measure, and measures the time between two successive echoes. This time is then divided by the sound velocity to yield the measurement. This means that the measurement makes use of the sound velocity, that has to be known from some other measurement. The simplest way to know this velocity is to make use of a reference piece of known thickness, made of the same material than the one that has to be measured, to measure the time between two echoes for the reference piece, and divide the reference thickness by the time. This is the way our apparatus worked.

However, a single shot measurement alone is not very precise, since the measured times are always small (of the order of one microsecond). To overcome this limitation, the apparatus takes several measurements of the propagation time and averages them. According to the manufacturer, this allows it to reach a resolution of \(\simeq 3\) microns on one measurement. However, these performances are attained in a relatively favourable case, i.e. with iron, for which the attenuation is lower than in lead and for which it is easy to get a very good surface quality.

## 3 The measurements

The plates we had to measure are divided in three different subsets:

* 55 small trapezoidal plates, of nominal thickness 1.2 mm.
* 55 big trapezoidal plates, of nominal thickness 1.8 mm.
* 320 square plates, 160 of thickness 1.2 mm and 160 of thickness 1.8 mm.

### Transducer positioning

To position the transducer, we have used either a plastic sheet where holes had been done at the positions where the measurements would have to be done, either a metallic ruler.

To operate properly, ultrasonic sensors need to be mechanically connected to the plate whose thickness has to be measured. This connection can not be directly achieved if the surface is grainy, which is always the case at the scale of a few microns. One has to use a liquid that acts as a mechanical transducer between the sensor and the plates. Commonly used liquids are alcohol and water. We have chosen to use alcohol because it does not leave deposits on the lead plates and can be used to clean up the plates. Demineralized water would have been a possible choice as well.

### High-resolution survey and step size

In each of these subsets, we have chosen one plate that has been used to make a high-resolution survey. The reason for this survey is to find the characteristic size of the deformation of the plates, to find which step to use later for the real control itself. To do this high-resolution survey, the step between two successive measurement points was chosen to be 2.0 cm. Since the transducer was contained in a cylindrical support of about 1.5 cm diameter, it would have been difficult to position precisely by hand to points separated by less than the cylinder diameter itself. This fact sets a lower limit on the attainable resolution of the survey. Furthermore, we are not interested in the observation of local variations on a scale of less than a few centimeters. This implies that a positioning precision of a few millimeters is largely enough. The maps we got are given in figure 5 to 8. If we project the maps on two axes 1, we get the profiles of figures 9 to 12. From these figures, we see that the typical size of the structures we can see on the plates is of the order of \(\simeq 20\) to 30 cm. From that we can conclude that we will be able to see these structures if we sample the plates with a step of 10 to 15 cm 2. Practically, the step was fixed to 15 cm. This enables us to see any structure with size greater than \(\simeq 30\) cm. From the size of the structures we have seen on the maps (figures 5 to 8), this value may seem a bit high, but it has chosen to keep the number of measurements to a reasonable value, given that the data had to be taken by hand. In the future, this limitation will be easily removed since the measurement process will be automated.

## 4 Intrinsic resolution of the apparatus

To determine the intrinsic resolution of the apparatus, we have used four different methods :

* Measurement of the same points on a reference plate.
* Double measurement of some points on each plate.
* Comparison between a palmer and the ultrasonic sensor for one point on each plate.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:6]

If we assume that the palmer is perfect and has an infinite resolution, the r.m.s. of the distribution of the differences between the palmer and the ultrasonic sensor is a measurement of the resolution of the sensor. In practice, since the palmer is not perfect, we overestimate slightly the resolution. Figure 18 gives this distribution for the various plate series. We can summarize the results in table 2.

## 5 Calibration

The ultrasonic sensor does not directly measure the thickness, since it measures in fact the time sound waves need to travel through the plate. To convert this propagation time to a distance, one needs to know the sound waves velocity. This number is not easy to determine precisely. The apparatus we have used implements the following scheme :

One measures first a plate with precisely known thickness. This yields a result that is in general not correct. If this is the case, one tells the apparatus which thickness it should have found. The apparatus deduces from that the sound waves velocity and uses this value for later measurements.

To study the calibration, we did first an approximate calibration, setting the sound waves velocity to 2.226 km/s. We did that by measuring one plate at one point with the palmer and calibrated the apparatus using this value. Next we did not change at all the calibration from plate to plate but took for each of the plates one measurement with the palmer and one measurement with the ultrasonic sensor.

Next we have to correct the approximate calibration, i.e. we have to find a number \(c\) so that :

\[d_{\texttt{calib.}}=c\times d_{\texttt{before caib.}}\]

The way to get the constant \(c\) is to take the average of the ratio \(\frac{d_{\texttt{polarmer}}}{d_{\texttt{before caib.}}}\). The distribution of this variable is plotted figure 16.

### Calibration error

Each time we measure a plate, we get an estimation of the calibration constant by computing the ratio \(d_{\texttt{palmer}}/d_{\texttt{before caib.}}\). This estimation of the calibration constant has some distribution that happens to look more or less gaussian3 (see figure 16). From this distribution we can easily deduce the uncertainty on the calibration constant. For now we simply take this uncertainty to be the r.m.s. \(\sigma\) of the distributions of figure 16. However, it is clear that this is a strong overestimation of this uncertainty : if we assume that each entry in figures 16 is a measurement of the calibration constant, and if the distribution is gaussian, for \(n\) measurements of the calibration constant the error on it is not \(\sigma\) but obviously \(\sigma/\sqrt{n}\).

## 6 Recapitulation of the results on the resolution

We should first notice that the intrinsic resolution and the resolution on the calibration should not be combined blindly ; We would like here to give our interpretation of these numbers.

The intrinsic resolution is the only one that makes sense if one wants simply to compare two measurements done in the same conditions (same kind of plates), i.e. if one wants to build a map of the thickness of a plate.

If one does not only want to know the deviations of the plate thickness from a planar plate, but one wants to know at the same time the absolute thickness of the plates, then in addition to the intrinsic resolution one has to take into account the uncertainty due to the calibration constant. Since the measurement of the calibration constant and the measurement of the thickness are not correlated4, both resolution have simply to be added in quadrature.

Footnote 4: The calibration constant is not determined with the same points as the ones used to actually measure the plates.

We summarize in table 4 the intrinsic and total resolutions. We see in this table that the intrinsic and total resolutions are below 10 microns, which was the goal.

## 7 Study of the long-range thickness variations

On nearly any of the plates, one clearly notices (relatively) short-range thickness variations. One may ask wether there are or not long-range thickness variations, that may be due for example to irregularities in the functioning of the rolling machine. To do this study, we have assumed that the plates had been delivered in the same order they had been rolled. We have taken the maps of each plate, projected them on the rolling axis and have put all the projected maps in the right order next to each other, to make a map of the lead plate as it came out from the rolling machine, before cutting and machining. This gives us the plot of figure 21 and 22. Clearly one sees a periodical structure with a size of about 150 cm. Since this period does not correspond with a multiple of the length of the plates that have been measured5, it is unlikely to be due to the measurement process itself, but it may be due to the rolling itself. In addition to these oscillations, one distinguishes some long-range variations, especially on figure 22, where there is a big decrease of thickness followed by an increase slightly over the average value before the big decrease. This could correspond to a stop of the rolling machine followed by some slight changes in the functioning of the machine.

Footnote 5: The square plates have been measured in bunches of three : each 2m plate is cut into three consecutive square plates.

## 8 Some quality criteria to accept a plate.

The measurements we have performed can be used to evaluate the quality of each plate and wether it is appropriate or not to use it for the construction of the calorimeter. The question that remains to be answered is : on which criterion will one take such a decision? From our measurements, several indicators can be built :

* The average thickness.
* The r.m.s. of the measurements for each plates. This one can be used to get a feeling of the deviations from planarity.
* The difference between the highest and the lowest measurements. This one measures the aplanarity too.

For each series, the average thickness computed from our measurements is plotted figure 23. The distributions look fairly gaussian. The 1.2 mm plates are systematically thinner than the theoretical value of 1.2 mm, whereas the 1.8 mm plates are slightly to thick. The r.m.s. of gaussians fitted to each of the distributions is about 5 microns for 1.2 mm plates, and about 10 microns for 1.8 mm plates. If one accepts to use only plates that lie within 5 microns around the mean of the distribution, one has to reject \(\simeq 30\%\) of the 1.2 mm plates, and \(\simeq 60\%\) of the 1.8 mm plates. This is of course unpracticable, and the plates will have to be paired.

In figure 24, we plot the average thickness of each plate as a function of the r.m.s. of the measurements on the same plate. There is clearly no correlation between these two variables. This means that the r.m.s. conveys some information that is independent of the information conveyed by the average. Here again, there are some plates that are clearly outliers, and a cut on the r.m.s. will have to be defined.

The difference between the highest and the lowest measurement does not bring any additional information, because it turns out to be strongly correlated to the r.m.s. (figure 25).

Given these quality estimators, the cuts must be given by physics consideration. To achieve this task, it is needed to do some simulation of the effects of the variations of the plate thickness (of the kind we have observed) on the performance of the calorimeter. This is the natural way to exploit our measurement s, from a physics point of view.

## 9 Future prospects

The plates have been measured by hand for now. In the construction phase, this will be unreasonable, because the number of points to measure will be of the order of 500 000, so a measurement machine using the same ultrasonic technique will be built. This will bring several improvements :

* It will speed up the whole process somewhat. By hand, the time needed to take one point is roughly five seconds, so that a 2m square plate can be measured within 375 seconds. This is already small compared to the time needed for other operations, but automation may reduce further this time.
* It will allow to take more measurements on each plate, if needed. Increasing the number of points will no longer increase the workload on a human operator and will be very easy to do.
* The calibration constant will be determined in a much more systematic and precise way : with a machine it is easy to measure with a palmer and with the ultrasonic sensor exactly the same point, whereas by hand the relative positioning of the palmer and of the ultrasonic sensor is always somewhat approximate.
* The intrinsic resolution will be better too, because all the measurements will be taken in more similar conditions than by hand : mechanical pressure on the sensor, amount of coupling liquid between the sensor and the plate...

In the future, the information we got from the measurements we have done now could be used by the manufacturer that produces them to improve the planarity of its product. For example, it would be a good point to find a way to reduce the amplitude of the long-range oscillations we have seen.
