## 1 Introduction

The particles dominating the occupancies of the muon tracking and triggering systems are mainly decay muons from primary hadrons and hadronic shower leakage from the calorimeter system ("punch-through"). We have calculated these punch-through and decay contributions and the main features of our strategy and preliminary results are described in detail in the Note [1]. The rates of muons and charged hadrons coming from the calorimeter also were presented in the ATLAS LoI [2].

The analysis performed for the LoI was based on the limited statistics of single positive pion showers generated at a fixed calorimeter thickness of 12 \(\lambda\). As for the punch-through calculations, this leads to the uncertainties which are determined by our knowledge of the hadron fragmentation function (the probability to find a secondary particle with some fraction of the momentum of the incident hadron after the absorber) and were estimated to be one order of magnitude.

Here we improve the calculation by increasing the statistics and including \(\lambda\)- and momentum dependence. The Note describes the parameterization of the momentum and \(\lambda\)-dependencies of the key values to estimate the punch-through contribution to the muon system occupancy.

## 2 Hadron fragmentation function

To study \(p_{h}-\) and \(\lambda\)-dependencies of relevant parameters responsible for calculation of the ATLAS muon system occupancy we have performed a full SLUG/GEANT(version 3.14) simulation of the single pion showers at different initial pion momenta from 5 \(GeV/c\) up to 500 \(GeV/c\). The showers were developed at \(\eta=0\) inside the LAr TGT electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters and tail-catcher. TGT calorimeter sampling is described inthe ATLAS LoI and in the DRDC Proposal [3]. The total thickness of the calorimeters was 8.5 \(\lambda\) (\(\lambda\) = 20.8 \(cm\)) with the inner and outer radii of 140 \(cm\) and 317 \(cm\), respectively. To obtain the \(\lambda\) - dependence the tail-catcher was "instrumented": thin (1 \(mm\)) scintillator planes were placed inside the tail-catcher after each 0.5 \(\lambda\)-layer of stainless steel.

The GEANT "hits-banks" were filled with the information on the coordinates and momentum values of muons, charged hadrons, \(\gamma\)-quanta and neutrons with low kinetic energy thresholds 1. Total numbers of generated showers are presented in Table 1.

Footnote 1: The kinetic energy thresholds for secondary particles produced in the shower were 300 \(keV\) for \(\gamma\), 1 \(MeV\) for \(e^{\pm}/n\) and 10 \(MeV\) for \(\mu^{\pm}\) / \(h^{\pm}\). These values are closed to the standard ones in Monte-Carlo generation and allow us to compare results with other calculations.

To generate these 532.500 showers a total of 940 CPU days (CERN units) of CSF farm were used.

1) **Punch-through probability.** Fig. 1 shows the values of punch-through probability obtained for different pion momenta and for different absorption lengths. The results are presented for two samples of GEANT data. One sample (lower probability values) corresponds to the events when only muons and charged hadrons were "registered" by scintillator planes. For another sample of data (higher probabilities) electrons and positrons were also treated as a "triggering" particles. For our analysis we have selected events with at least one muon or charged hadron registered. Thus, the distributions we have fitted were normalized by the number of events which were satisfied this requirement at different absorber thickness. The parameterization of the punch-through probability proposed by F.Lacava in the Note [4] is represented by curves. This parameterization is based on experimental data. The disagreement between two samples and F.Lacava predictions is seen only for pions of low momenta. As it was shown in [1] the punch-through probability values for low momentum hadrons are very sensitive for the selection criteria which have been used (type of particles, signal threshold, etc.).

Thus, when using F.Lacava's formulas to calculate punch-through probability the \(\lambda\)-dependence will be reproduced quite satisfactorily and only for hadron momenta \(p_{h}\leq 10\)\(GeV/c\) should uncertainties of a factor of 2\(\div\)3 be taken into account.

2) **Parameterization of the fragmentation function.** A sample of experimental data on the momentum spectrum of escaping muons is relatively poor. In Lab E neutrino experiment (unpublished, see [5]) and E-379 Fermilab experiment [6] a weak dependence of the hadron fragmentation function, \(D_{h\to\mu}(z)\), on primary hadron momenta and on the total absorption length was demonstrated. Also it was shown that the shape of the function can be described satisfactorily by sum of two exponentials so, that the normalization

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline \(p_{\tau+}(GeV/c)\) & 5 & 10 & 20 & 40 & 100 & 300 & 500 \\ \hline \(N_{tot}^{event}\) & 300K & 80K & 80K & 40K & 20K & 8K & 4.5K \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Statistics of single pion showers generated at different pion momenta and \(\eta\) = 0.

constraint has to be satisfied :

\[D_{\mu}(z)=a_{1}e^{-b_{1}z}+a_{2}e^{-b_{2}z}, \tag{1}\]

\[\int_{0}^{1}D(z)dz=<n_{\mu}> \tag{2}\]

Thus, using \(D(z)\) we can predict multiplicity and momentum spectrum of muons caused by the hadronic shower of the known momenta hadron at the given thickness of the absorber.

The distributions of muons as a function of the fraction of initial pion momenta, \(z=p_{\mu}/p_{h}\), were fitted by sum of two exponentials with four free parameters. This sample of values was analysed to be parametrized in terms of initial pion momentum and \(\lambda\)'s. The features of the analysis and the detailed form of the parameterization are described in the Appendix.

Fig. 2 represents the comparison of the GEANT results on the pion fragmentation function with the calculations (Eq. 1) using the parameterizations of the exponential terms and arguments. The comparison is presented for different pion momenta (10, 40 and \(300GeV/c\)) and total absorption lengths (9, 11 and 13\(\lambda\)). The results of the calculation are shown by solid lines. A satisfactory agreement allows us to implement the obtained parameterization in the fast Monte - Carlo Generator in order to obtain the contribution of the punch-through muons to the ATLAS muon system occupancy.

## 3 Results of the fast Monte-Carlo for the muon rates

As it was done in [1] to deal with minimum bias events, we have used ISAJET to generate a sample of two-jet events with the lower limit on \(P_{T}^{jet}\) chosen to give a cross section equal to the minimum bias inelastic cross section (see ISAJET 6.34 Manual). So, we used 3.8 \(GeV/c\) - cut for the jet transverse momentum value which resulted in \(\sigma\)=79\(mb\) closed to the prediction of PYTHIA for minimum bias event cross section (80 \(mb\)).

We also used a simple tracking procedure in 2 \(T\) magnetic field for secondary hadrons produced in the vertex at the center of the detector. The geometrical scheme of the absorber is presented in Fig. 3. The muon production from the following hadrons was considered:

\[\pi^{\pm},\ \ \pi^{0},\ \ K^{\pm},\ \ K^{0}_{S,L},\ \ p,\ \ \overline{p},\ \ n,\ \ \overline{n},\ \ \Lambda^{0},\ \ \overline{\Lambda^{0}}.\]

To calculate the rates of muons produced in the hadron decays two-particle kinematics as well as branching ratios were taken into account and it was assumed that the muon maintains direction of the parent hadron flow (i.e. zero value of magnetic field inside the homogeneous calorimeter was considered). The momentum of the muon was decreased by the value of \(E_{loss}=0.22\ GeV/c\) multiplied by the hadron potential range inside the absorber, \(L_{abs}\) (in \(\lambda\)'s). The value of \(E_{loss}\) was determined from GEANT simulation. It was applied to the analysis of the decay muon momentum spectrum.

The input parameters for the punch-through calculations were the hadron momentum value and its \(L_{abs}\). The momenta of muons produced by the hadron were calculated as \(p_{\mu}=z\cdot p_{h}\) ( the values of z were taken randomly from the uniform distribution in the interval of \((0\div 1)\)). They were stored in the histogram with weight \(w_{\mu}=(1-P_{decay})\cdot P_{ punch}\cdot D_{\mu}(z)\)where \(P_{decay}\) is the calculated probability of the hadron decay inside the inner cavity of the absorber (calorimeter), \(P_{punch}\) is the punch-through probability [4] and \(D_{\mu}(z)\) is the hadron fragmentation function. The coordinates of the muons were calculated using straightline continuations of the hadron trajectories inside the absorber and the pion fragmentation function was used for any type of hadron. As for the last simplification, it was observed in [6] that muon yields from showers initiated by kaons, protons and neutrons can be obtained by correcting results for pions. It amounts to a 3% decrease in the total muon yield as compared to the case where the contributions from all the secondaries were taken equal to that of pions.

Fig. 4 shows the calculation of the muon rates from hadron decays (which are dominant) and hadron punch-through. In comparison with the results presented in the ATLAS LoI (dashed histograms) we have approximately the same values of decay muon rates at different rapidities. The small difference is being due to a change in the value of \(E_{loss}\). As for the punch-through contribution, the change is caused by the different parameterization of the hadron fragmentation function and is discussed below. In general, the rates in the barrel region are lower by factor of 7 and by factor of 7 higher in the end-caps. That is less than one order of magnitude uncertainties level as it was estimated for the previous parameterization and presented in the LoI. Fig. 5 reproduces total muon rates when different \(p_{T}\)-cuts are applied. New parameterization did not change the results for \(p_{T}\)-cuts higher then 5 \(GeV/c\).

Fig. 6 reproduces the result of the calculations for different thickness of the absorber in the barrel region (7\(\lambda\), 9\(\lambda\), 12\(\lambda\) and 15\(\lambda\)) and in the end-caps (9\(\lambda\), 11\(\lambda\), 14\(\lambda\) and 17\(\lambda\)). For these calculations the dimensions of the inner cavity (\(R_{in}\)=140 \(cm\), \(Z_{in}\)=345 \(cm\)) as well as \(\lambda_{abs}=27.2\)\(cm\) were fixed and the outer dimensions of the calorimeter were different ( \(R_{out}=330_{7\lambda},384_{9\lambda},466_{12\lambda}\) and 547\({}_{15\lambda}\) cm, \(Z_{out}=589_{9\lambda},644_{11\lambda},725_{14\lambda}\) and 807\({}_{17\lambda}\) cm). In order to illustrate \(\lambda\)-dependence of muon rates and compare results for a different configurations of the absorber than with those obtained for the "standard" variant ( 12 \(\lambda\) / 14 \(\lambda\) ) the geometrical factor ( \(\sim 1/R\) ) was taken into account. Thus, Fig. 7 demonstrates \(\lambda\)-dependence of muon rates for fixed outer dimensions of the calorimeter in the barrel region (\(\eta=0\)) and in the end-caps (\(\eta=2.5\)).

It is seen that the muon rates in the end-caps region decreased by the factor of 5 when the total absorbson thickness was changed from 9 \(\lambda\) to 17 \(\lambda\). In the barrel region the rates reduction is about factor of 16 for \(L_{abs}\) changing from 7 \(\lambda\) to 15 \(\lambda\). But one has to take in mind that the hadronic component of the hadron shower leakages may dominate at high rapidity values (\(\eta\sim\) 3) [11].

## 4 Direct comparison with GEANT simulation for jets

It is interesting to compare our calculations with full GEANT simulation when we have information about the hadrons emitted from the vertex with known momentum value and know the result of the hadron showering hitting the muon system.

The same particles were used as for full GEANT simulation and for the parameterization with the same routines used in the fast Monte - Carlo program. The type and momentum of every hadron were considered as input values to calculate a sample of coordinates and momentum values of the muons leaving the calorimeter. For the same events

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:5]

muon coordinates which were used to calculate the value of "geometrical" rapidity. A similar comparison for (1 \(\div\) 3) \(TeV\) jets is shown in Fig. 9 and it indicates a growing contribution from the hadron punchthrough. The parameterization underestimates the yield of muons by the factor of 4 which is caused by the systematics in the shape of the fragmentation function for high momentum hadron at low thickness of the absorber (see Appendix for more details). Right columns of the Table 2 show the number of muons "registered" in GEANT by the muon system and the corresponding values calculated using the parameterization. It is seen a satisfactory agreement on multiplicity of muons produced by the jets of different energies at various rapidities.

## 5 Uncertainties of the calculations

As for the muon rates calculations, there are a few sources of uncertainties which manifest themselves in different ways for punch-through and decay muons. These are described here and the numerical results are given as a function of \(\eta\) in Fig. 14.

\(\bullet\)**Tracking.** The assumption that muons maintain the direction of the parent hadron flow is applicable for the punch-through calculations. But it may come to some overestimation of decay muon rates in the barrel region as we have not generated the coordinates of the decay point but in reality the muons having a lower momenta are shifted by \(2T\) magnetic field to the end-caps. Nevertheless, the comparison with GEANT simulations for jets shows that in general the tracking procedure used reproduced a sample of the hits coordinates (see Fig. 8 - 9).

\(\bullet\)**Absorber geometry is simplified in order to have a homogeneous medium with the same value of \(\lambda_{abs}\) for different \(\eta\). In comparison with the real geometry this is resulted in a deviations which in principle can be taken into account in the fast Monte-Carlo program. But to obtain correct value of \(\lambda\) one has to perform a detailed simulation of the absorber. In fact, when changing \(\lambda\) we are changing the threshould for the low momentum decay muons to be considered. Another problem is the usage of the same average value of the decay muon energy losses for various \(\eta\) and \(p_{\mu}\). However, for the absorber of (12\(\div\)14) \(\lambda\) thickness we have not seen a significant difference in the decay muon rates using 0.195 and 0.220 \(GeV/c\) as a reduction factor for the initial value of the decay muon momenta (\(\triangle p_{\mu}\) / 1 \(\lambda\)).

As for the punch-through calculations, Fig. 7 shows that the uncertainties due to changing \(\lambda\) are not significant and can be obtained accurately when comparing with the real absorber geometry. In the previous Note [1] we have investigated the influence of 10-\(cm\) gap (inside the calorimeter) on the muon production by ( 10 \(\div\) 20 ) GeV/c pions and we have observed no increasing of punch-through probability.

\(\bullet\)**Systematics in \(D_{\mu}(x)\) is an important uncertainty in the calculation of the punch-through contribution, and it has to be estimated for different regions of the hadron momentum spectrum as well as \(\eta\)'s.

Using the previous parameterization of the hadron fragmentation function [1] we had a spike at the low momentum part of muon spectrum. The reason was that because of the lack of statistics we have fitted sum of GEANT generation results for different hadron momenta and at fixed absorption thickness of 12 \(\lambda\). In the present analysis more details were taken into account and resulting muon spectra are reproduced in Fig. 10 for both parameterizations. The absence of the spike is an additional argument to confirm the validity of the calculations.

One of the ways to check the parameterization (Eq.1) is to calculate average muon multiplicity (Eq. 2) for different pion momenta and various \(L_{abs}\). Fig. 11 represents results of GEANT simulation for the muon average multiplicity dependence on the absorption length for different pion momenta. Increasing of \(<n_{\mu}>/P_{punch}\) with \(L_{abs}\) is explained by the "triggering" condition (we have selected events with at least one muon or hadron to be observed) and also by the effective absorption of the hadronic component of the pion showers.

It is seen from Fig. 11 that using the parameters of the hadron fragmentation function one can reproduce average muon multiplicities quite well through hadron momenta of 100 \(GeV/c\). This range of momenta covers 99.99% of hadrons produced in minimum bias events. For higher hadron momenta we underestimate yield of muons by (20 \(\div\) 30)% at \(L_{abs}<\) 10 \(\lambda\) and also we may be mistaken with the parameterization at \(L_{abs}>\) 14 \(\lambda\) (near \(\eta\sim\) 1.0 \(\div\) 1.2).

Unfortunately, we have not found experimental data on the hadron fragmentation function at similar values of the total absorption thickness2. Therefore, the uncertainties of one order of magnitude for muon rates from the hadron punch-through may still be maintained at the region of high \(L_{abs}\) as well as of highest hadron momenta. Fig. 12 shows the comparison of the obtained parameterization with the data of the Lab E neutrino experiment ( 26 \(\lambda\) ) and E-379 Fermilab experiment ( 18.5 \(\lambda\) ) taken from the paper [5]. The data were normalized to the number of the incident hadrons. Therefore, we have multiplied the result of our calculations by the factor equal to the punch-through probability value. Total absorption length value of 26 \(\lambda\) is far from the validity interval of the obtained parameterization and a straightforward usage of the \(\lambda\)- and \(p_{h}\)- dependencies results in an overestimation of the fragmentation function values. That is why to reproduce the sample of the Lab E experiment results the restriction value of \(L_{abs}=\) 21 \(\lambda\) for \(D(z)\) calculations was selected.

Footnote 2: The results of R&D5 on the muon momentum spectra at similar thickness of the absorber will be available soon [7]. As for the punch - through probability, the parameterization by F.Lacava reproduces R&D5-data [8] well enough.

\(\bullet\)**The Monte - Carlo event generator was also varied to estimate corresponding uncertainties. So, the minimum bias events were generated using PYTHIA ( with \(MSEL=1\) option ) including both high - \(p_{T}\) processes of \(QCD\) and low - \(p_{T}\) production without single and double diffractive and elastic scattering. An agreement with the characteristics of minimum bias events presented in Aachen [9] for different Monte - Carlo generators was obtained. The details of the PYTHIA usage for calculations of muon rates from different sources will be published soon in [10].

The same routines to calculate contribution of hadron decays and punch-through were used with PYTHIA. Fig. 13 reproduces the ISAJET and PYTHIA results for total muon rates in the minimum bias events. It is seen that PYTHIA systematically overestimates (or ISAJET underestimates) the rates by the factor of 3 in the barrel region and by the factor of (1.5 \(\div\) 2) in the end-caps. The systematics in the disagreement between two models are caused by the difference in the hadron momentum spectra produced in ISAJET and PYTHIA \(pp\) - collisions. In general, a sample of minimum bias events in PYTHIAhas slightly higher hadron multiplicity as well as hadron ( transverse ) momenta [9].

**Summary of the uncertainties estimation.**

Due to higher statistics and detailed parameterization of the hadron fragmentation function the uncertainties of these calculations we estimated to be significantly lower then those presented in the previous Note [1] and ATLAS LoI. To illustrate this statement the results of sufficiently different calculations of the background from minimum bias events are presented in Fig. 13 by closed circles. This calculations were performed by A. Ferrari [11] from I.N.F.N. (Milano) using full GEANT simulation with FLUKA for hadron shower development and DTUJET for the event generation. The results of the quite different approaches are in a good agreement.

In general, the uncertainties of the muon rates calculations can be divided into two main groups. The first one is selection of Monte-Carlo generator (it is dominant) and the second one is a combination of the following: disadvantages of the tracking, absorber simplifications, and \(D(z)\)-parameterization. A summary of the uncertainties in the rate calculations is presented in Fig. 14. Monte - Carlo generator, tracking and absorber simplifications are important for both punch-through and decay muon rates calculations. For the hadron punch-through one also has to take into account the systematics in the hadron fragmentation function.

To estimate the uncertainty level we have used the difference of the results presented as in Fig. 8 and Fig. 13 relative to our "standard" calculations.

Direct comparison with GEANT simulations gives us the uncertainty value caused by the calculation method used (see Fig. 14(a)). For decay and punch-through muon rates these uncertainties are of a 30% level (at \(\eta\sim 0\)) decreasing with growing \(\eta\).

Total muon rates obtained with PYTHIA and ISAJET are compared in Fig. 14(b) using the factor "( PYTHIA - ISAJET ) / ISAJET " for different rapidity intervals. The magnitude of the factor indicates the uncertainties of the muon rates calculations due to the usage of different Monte - Carlo generators. One sees in Fig. 13 the same systematics for both punch-through and decay muon rates. This uncertainties are less than factor 3 in the barrel region and they are (30 \(\div\) 50)% in the end-caps.

Fig. 14(c) shows the uncertainties in \(\lambda\)-dependence of the parameterization used for the punch-through calculations in minimum bias events. The estimation was done comparing muon rates obtained with our "standard" cut ( 14 \(\lambda\) ) and without any cut on the value of \(L_{abs}\) for the calculations of the hadron fragmentation function.

It is seen that the sources mentioned may result in some overestimation of the muon rates. Finally, Fig. 14(d-e) reproduces by dashed lines the total level of uncertainties for muon rates calculations versus our "standard" fast Monte -Carlo program version results (solid lines) for different rapidity values. We have combined the fits presented in Fig. 14(a-c) by solid lines to calculate total systematics. With the new parameterization we reached about ten times higher accuracy but the uncertainties caused by Monte -Carlo generator usage is dominant in the entire rapidity region.

## 6 Conclusions

The calculations based on the detailed study of hadron fragmentation function confirm the results on muon background in minimum bias events presented in the ATLAS LoI.

We are in agreement with the results obtained by a significantly different approach (full GEANT/FLUKA/DTUJET simulations) and also with another Monte - Carlo generator (PYTHIA). Using the parameterization we have described the results of the GEANT simulations for \(d-\) and \(g-\)jets of different energies emitted at various rapidity values.

However, some uncertainties may be avoided to increase the validity of the obtained parameterization. This is concerned mainly the highest values of hadron momenta. To made the parameterization more valid as well as universal we have to generate hadronic showers for the total absorption length till to 20 \(\lambda\) and also for \(p_{h}\sim(1\div 3)\ TeV/c\). Of course, it has to be done with the statistics which is about ten times greater than that was used in the present analysis.

The investigations may result also in the parameterization of the momentum spectra of charged as well as neutral hadrons outgoing the calorimeter. It looks to be possible to apply the program which is developed to describe the space distributions of hits caused by hadronic shower leakage.

Thus, the fast Monte - Carlo program based on ISAJET or PYTHIA generation and on the parameterization of the hadron fragmentation function with a simple tracking procedure is applicable as for the selection of the muon system setup parameters and for more realistic modelling of different reactions as well as triggering study.

## Appendix

A sample of parameters of the two-exponential fit used to describe the muon distributions on fraction of the initial pion momenta was analysed. The lack of statistics does not permit the multidimensional fit of the parameters to be performed as significant fluctuations of their \(p_{h}-\) and \(\lambda-\)dependencies were found and also correct formulas as well as initial values of the parameters have to be determined before. To avoid the problems we used the following method: **1)** constrain \(\int_{0}^{1}D(z)dz=<n_{\mu}>=a_{1}/b_{1}+a_{2}/b_{2}\) and determine \(p_{h}\)-dependence of \(b_{1}\) allowing \(a_{1},b_{1}\) and \(b_{2}\) to vary; **2)** fix \(p_{h}\)-dependence of \(b_{1}\) as determined in 1), and refit allowing \(b_{2}\) and \(a_{1}\) to vary; **3)** fix \(p_{h}\)-dependence of \(b_{2}\) as determined in 2), and fit \(a_{1}\) as function of \(p_{h}\) and \(L_{abs}/\lambda\).

We have not found a \(\lambda\) - dependence of the slope values for different pion momenta (except the first points at \(\sim 8.5\)\(\lambda\) which were not used) and they can be parametrized in terms of \(\ln p_{\pi^{+}}\). This form of the argument was taken because of a large scale of the initial pion momenta values. Momentum dependence of the \(b_{1}\)- and \(b_{2}\)-values is presented in Fig. 15. The slope values are well reproduced by the following expressions (solid lines):

\[b_{1,2}=p_{0}+e^{p_{1}} \tag{3}\]

with the parameters :

\[p_{0}=2.63,\ \ p_{1}=-1.361+1.324\cdot\ln p_{\pi^{+}}\]

for \(b_{1}\) (dominant contribution), and

\[p_{0}=3.486,\ \ p_{1}=-4.55+1.454\cdot\ln p_{\pi^{+}}\]

for \(b_{2}\) (the "tail").

The results of GEANT simulations for the muon average multiplicity shown in Fig. 11 indicate in particular the contribution of low momentum muons exiting the first few layers of scintillator planes and which are absorbed later by a few \(0.5\)\(\lambda\) - layers of stainless steel. The low momenta muons may be produced in the \(\sim 0.5\)\(cm\) - gap between the outer surface of the calorimeter and tail-catcher via the hadron decays in the hadronic shower leakage outgoing the calorimeter.

In the present analysis we neglected these effects and to obtain the parameterization of the factor \(a_{1}\), an exponential form of the \(\lambda\) - dependence was applied :

\[a_{1}=exp(p_{1}+p_{2}\cdot(\frac{L_{abs}}{\lambda}))+p_{3} \tag{4}\]

with the following parameters as the functions of \(\ln p_{\pi^{+}}\):

\[p_{1}=-2.398-1.313\cdot\ln p_{\pi^{+}},\]

\[p_{2}=0.199-0.141\cdot\ln p_{\pi^{+}},\]

\Factor \(a_{2}\) was obtained via (Eq. 2) using calculated values of \(b_{1},b_{2},a_{1}\) and muon average multiplicity. It also was parametrized as an exponential (Eq. 4) with parameters

\[p_{1}=-8.337+0.6226\cdot\ln p_{\pi^{+}},\] \[p_{2}=0.931-0.29\cdot\ln p_{\pi^{+}}+0.036\cdot\ln^{2}p_{\pi^{+}},\] \[p_{3}=0.\]

The final results for the parameterization of the hadron fragmentation function are presented in Fig. 2 by solid lines. The parameterization reproduces GEANT simulation for the momentum spectrum of the muons produced by the hadronic showers at various momenta of primary pions and at the different depths of the calorimeter. The input parameters of the calculations are hadron momentum and its potential range inside the absorber. This allows one to take advantage of \(D(z)\) values as the muon weights when filling the corresponding histograms.

However, one has to take into account the validity interval of the obtained parameterization. It is certainly applicable for hadron momenta of ( 5 \(\div\) 500 ) \(GeV/c\) and in the range of the total absorption length \(L_{abs}=\) ( 8 \(\div\) 14 ) \(\lambda\).
