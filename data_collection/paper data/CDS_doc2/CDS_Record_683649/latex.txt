We studied a possibility of a single tube measurements by X-ray with same setup, which was used for test of 4x8 drift tube prototype/1/. Seven tubes from series of ones constructed for the prototype were measured. End plugs of a tested tube were put in pair of precise prismatic or balls supports ( fig.1(a,b) ) placed at right side of the prototype attributes of which were used as a detector of X-ray ( beam 2 ). The tested tube could be rotated in the supports around its axis. We should like remember that end plugs are precise elements of drift tube. Outer diameter of the end plug is 30.100\(\pm\)0.002(RMS)mm.

## 2 Measurement of wire eccentricity

If wire in a tube is displaced with respect to rotation center of the tube then measured coordinate of the wire will oscillate:

\(X_{meas}\)=p1+p2\(\cdot\varphi\)+p3\(\cdot\)cos(\(\varphi\)+p4) (1)

With taking into account X-ray beam angle ( \(\alpha\) is an angle between X-ray beam and ruler ) parameter p1 gives coordinate of the rotation center X,=p1/sin(\(\alpha\)). Amplitude and phase of oscillation wave in expression (1) give wire displacement from the rotation center R\({}_{wire}\)=p3/sin(\(\alpha\)) and \(\varphi_{wire}\)=p4, where R\({}_{wire}\) and \(\varphi_{wire}\) are wire displacement in a polar system of coordinates attached to end plug of tube.

Sometimes we performed measurements without waiting for an establishing of temperature equilibrium of X-ray setup. In order to describe a temperature drift of beam position a term p2\(\cdot\varphi\) was introduced in expression (1). Time of measurement a wire coordinate is about the same for each \(\varphi\) and the term means linear drift of beam position with time.

Measured wire coordinate as a function of the rotation angle is presented in fig.2seven tubes. Tube number indicated in each histogram is one in production series.

Range of \(\varphi\) corresponds to 1 or 2 turns. Curve is fit by mentioned above function (1). Temporal drift due to temperature variation is well seen for tube 12 and 3, where 2 turns measurement results are presented. The results given in fig.2 were measured with the balls rotation support. Comparison of wire eccentricity measurement with prismatic supports and balls ones is shown in fig.3 for tubes 2,12 and 34. Wire eccentricity radius is about the same for both supports, but there is difference in the oscillation phase about of 30-40\({}^{\circ}\). It is seen that balls supports are better, \(\chi^{2}\) is 2-10 times less for these supports as compare to prismatic ones. All further results will be given for the balls supports.

Radius of wire displacement from the center ( R\({}_{wire}\) ) and angle of displacement ( \(\varphi_{wire}\) ) with respect to coordinate frame attached to high voltage end plug are presented in table 1. The same results are shown in fig.4, where asterisks indicate wire position. Boxes are error ranges. There is large eccentricity of wire in the 1st tube which was caused by an imperfection of production tools. The imperfection was removed after the 1st tube manufacturing. Without the 1st tube we have follow mean wire eccentricity: X\({}_{wire}\)=6.3\(\pm\)6.2\(\mu\)m, Y\({}_{wire}\)=6.7\(\pm\)4.4\(\mu\)m, R\({}_{wire}\)=10.2\(\pm\)3.4\(\mu\)m and \(\varphi_{wire}\)=1.25\(\pm\)0.74 radian. Indicated errors are RMS of distributions.

The described above procedure of wire eccentricity measurement is precise but require about 1 or 1.5 hour because of for each angle the coordinate range about 0.2mm must be scanned and wire shadow must be measured. We tested also more simplified approach. It is based on measurement of counting rate versus \(\varphi\) at some fixed position of X-ray beam near wire. For eccentrical wire distance between X-ray beam and the wire will dependent on \(\varphi\) hence we shall detect different counting rate ( \(N_{wire}/N_{X-ray}\) ) in detecting tube. ('Unfortunately parameterization of is quite complex and dependent of the beam position with respect to wire eccentricity cycle:

\[N_{wire}/N_{X-ray}\]

=p1+p2\cdot exp(-0.5((p3\pm r)/p4)^{2}), (2)

where r=p5\(\cdot\)(1-cos(x+p6)+sin(x+p6)/tg\(\alpha\)) or r=p5\(\cdot\)(cos(x+p6)+sin(x+p6)/tg\(\alpha\)). Choice of r as well as sign before r in (2) will dependent on the beam position with respect to wire.

Parameters p1,p2,p4 describe wire shadow in counting rate ( for example, see fig.2-6 in ref.1 ). They are known and can be well bounded. Parameters p5 and p6 define wire eccentricity R\({}_{wire}\)=p5, \(\varphi_{wire}\)=p6. In fig.5 and 6 dependences N\({}_{wire}\)=f(\(\varphi\)) are presented for two tubes and for several positions of the X-ray beam with respect to rotation center where curves are fits with expression (2). The procedure of the measurements is fast ( about 10-15 minutes ). It gives radius of wire eccentricity with precession about of 5\(\mu\)m, but it is impossible to find wire phase without knowledge of X-ray beam position ("up" or "down") with respect to wire.

## 3 Wall measurements

When X-ray beam touches a wall of tube sharp decreasing of counting rate in detecting tube is seen ( see fig.13(c) in ref.1 ). Half maximum of the step was taken as a measured position of tube wall outer surface. Similar to wire measurements we measured wall coordinate as a function of the rotation angle. For each rotation angle two wall positions ( marked as "down" and "up" in fig.1c ) are measured. Dependences of tube wall coordinate versus rotation angle are shown in fig.7 for down ( squares ) and up ( asterisks ) beam position. Fit curves in the figure correspond to function 1 with taking into account the beam angle. Up and down measurements of a tube wall are well correlated. Oscillation is also well seen. Its amplitude gives tube wall eccentricity from 40 to 64\(\mu\)m ( Table 2 ).

Difference of up and down wall coordinate gives outer tube diameter. Outer tube diameter (D\({}_{outer}\)-30000)\(\mu\)m versus rotation angle is shown in fig.8. Full line indicates mean value. Curve is a fit with function describing elliptical shape. There is well seen ellipticity for tubes 2,3,7,13. Results an usual mechanical micrometer measurements for tube 2 ( squares ) also shown. Micrometer measurements confirmed ellipticity of the tube but it is seen that mechanical micrometer deforms tube. It can explain difference about 33\(\mu\)m between mechanical measurement and X-ray one. Tube wall ellipticity parameters are given in table 3 where the ellipticity means half of difference between maximal and minimal outer tube diameters.

Conclusion

Performed studies show that X-ray tomography is a power tool for a single tube measurements. Wire and wall eccentricity as well as wall ellipticity can be measured with several microns precision. Disadvantage is a duration of the measurements up to 1.5-2 hours per tube.
