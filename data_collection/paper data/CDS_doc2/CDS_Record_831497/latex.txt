This note describes the beamline instrumentation, such as scintillators, beamchambers and Cherenkov detectors, and extra detectors, used in the 2004 combined testbeam of the ATLAS detector. The readout of these detectors via two VME crates, and the setup of the trigger logic and the timing are described. The DAQ system is briefly described.

Introduction

In the summer and autumn of 2004 the combined ATLAS testbeam took place at CERN using the H8 beamline. This was the first time all the detectors in ATLAS were tested together, and many of the systems was final production versions. The Level 1 trigger, combining signals from the calorimeter and muon system has also been tested during the testbeam.

The different detectors in ATLAS are from the beam pipe and out; the Inner Detector (ID), the Liquid Argon calorimeter (LAr), the Tile Hadronic calorimeter, and the Muon Spectrometer. The ATLAS detector is described in detail elsewhere [1], and only a short review will be given here. The ID is the tracking detector in ATLAS and is contained inside a 2 T solenoid which provides an axial magnetic field. The ID consists of three subsystems. Closest to the interaction point is the silicon pixel vertex detector with a very high granularity. Then there are silicon strip detectors, and finally straw drift tubes interleaved with transition radiators. A barrel cryostat around the inner detector cavity contains the barrel electromagnetic calorimeter and the solenoidal coil which supplies a uniform field to the inner tracking volume. This coil is placed in front of the e.m. calorimeter. The e.m calorimeter is a Lead-Liquid Argon sampling calorimeter with hermetic accordion geometry, and with an integrated preshower detector, a presampler layer immediately behind the cryostat wall for energy recovery. The end-cap hadronic calorimeters also use Liquid Argon technology, with copper absorber plates. The end-cap cryostat's house the e.m., hadronic and forward calorimeters (Copper/tungsten-Liquid Argon sampling). The barrel hadronic calorimeter is an iron-scintillating tile sampling calorimeter, where the tiles are placed perpendicular to the colliding beams. The Muon Spectrometer uses air-core toroids. Eight superconducting coils with warm voussoirs are used in the barrel region complemented with superconducting end-cap toroids in the forward regions. The ATLAS trigger scheme is a three-level trigger and data-acquisition system. The first-level trigger signatures are: high-PT muons, electrons, photons, jets and large missing transverse energy. For low-luminosity operation of LHC, a low-PT muon signature will be used in addition. At levels two and three, more complex signatures will be used to select the events to be retained for analysis.

The testbeam table setup, which can be seen in figure 1, resembled the geometry and setup of the full ATLAS detector as much as technically possible.

In this combined testbeam a full barrel slice of the ATLAS experiment was tested. The inner detector was represented by three layers of six pixel modules, and four layers of two SCT modules each, which were situated inside a magnetic field, and by two wedges of the barrel TRT placed just after the magnet. The e.m. LAr calorimeter prototype module was housed inside a cryostat filled with liquid Argon. For the hadron Tile calorimeter three barrel, and three Extended Barrel (EB) modules were used. All of the Tile modules except the barrel module at the bottom were production modules. When running with extended barrel modules, a small extra e.m. calorimeter was placed in front of the EB modules, to extend the coverage. A couple of meters behind the table a part of the barrel Muon Spectrometer, a Monitored Drift Tube (MDT) BOS chamber, was placed, and four more barrel MDT stations (seven chambers) were placed further downstream. One end-cap Cathode Strip Chamber (CSC), six end-cap MDT chambers at three stations, one end-cap Thin Gap Chamber (TGC)triplet, and two TGC doublets were also placed further downstream. There was also a muon trigger consisting of two 10x10 cm scintillators, two trigger stations of barrel Resistive Plate Counters (RPC), and two magnets installed.

This was the first testbeam with the participation of all the sub-detectors, which will give a unique opportunity to evaluate the full potential of ATLAS. A level one trigger "a la ATLAS" and the DAQ system was also tested in realistic conditions. Many of these systems were also final "production" versions. The main purposes and motivations are summarized below:

* Integrate the DAQ system, level 1 trigger in the 25 ns runs, and the detectors, this can be seen as a pre-commissioning.
* Combined reconstruction of muons, electrons and pions using the information from the Inner Detector, the combined Calorimetry and the Muon Spectrometer.
* Test of the reconstruction and simulation software, tuning of the Monte Carlo to the testbeam data.
* Classical studies as;
* Energy and position resolutions, efficiencies and noise.

Figure 1: Schematic of the testbeam table setup. The beam particles first hit the pixel and SCT modules, and then continue towards the TRT, Calorimeters, and Muon modules. In the coordinate system used, the beam travels in the positive \(x\) direction, \(y\) points upwards, and \(z\) points out of the paper, which also is the positive eta direction. The table containing the calorimeters could be translated and rotated to simulate that the particles came from the interaction point at different eta.

* ID: Global system performance and data handling, pixel spatial resolution, and efficiency vs beam intensity.
* Calorimeters: energy calibration and sharing, e/h measurements, linearity and uniformity versus energy and eta, shower containment and profiles, studies of energy losses in passive material (cryostat walls), and jet reconstruction.
* Muon Spectrometer: General stability and uniformity studies of MDT chambers. Test of the barrel and end-cap trigger and alignment systems. Muon momentum measurements in the end-cap stand.

## 2 The beamline

The H8 beamline provides hadrons, electrons or muons with energies from 1 up to 350 GeV for the combined ATLAS testbeam. The H8 beam is created by extracting a up to 400 GeV/\(c\) proton beam from the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) towards the North Area, where the beam is directed onto the T4 primary target. Typical intensities of this primary beam are a few \(10^{12}\) protons per burst. The spill lengths at 400 GeV/\(c\) are 4.8 s and there is a spill every 16.8 s. In the North Area there are 4 beamlines, two from the T4 target (H6,H8), and two from the T2 target (H2,H4). From the primary T4 target (Beryllium, up to 300 mm) the secondary beam will have energies from 10 to 350 GeV/\(c\). A secondary filter target, 8 or 16 mm of lead or 1000 mm Polyethylene, plus an absorber, air or lead, can be placed in the beam to produce tertiary beam of "pure" electrons (lead plus air) or pions (Polyethylene plus lead). The beam can also be diverted onto an additional secondary target (T48) further downstream, close to the experiment, to provide energies from 1 to 9 GeV/\(c\).

The beamline consists of a number of magnets, quadrapole and dipoles, for focusing and bending the particles and select the right momentum by controlling the magnet currents. Then there are also a number of collimator's where the opening can be controlled. The targets, magnets, collimator's and other beam related controls as door access, security, and taxes to stop the beam, are controlled via a terminal in the control room. Information on the North area, and the H8 beamline can be found on the SL Website [2].

## 3 Beamline instrumentation

The beamline instrumentation used by the combined testbeam consists of scintillators, beamchambers, and Cherenkov detectors. These detectors are used for the trigger, to get the beam position and quality, and for particle ID. The beamline instrumentation can be seen in figure 2, including the last beam magnets. The distances between the beam instrumentation and detectors are shown in table 1.

### Cherenkov Counters

There are three 1 m long Cherenkov counters along the H8 beamline [3]. The first one is furthest upstream and named CHRV1. The two others are placed just upstream of the last bend of the Very Low Energy (VLE) beamline, one on the straight beam line in case of higher momenta, \(>\) 10 GeV/\(c\), and the other one is placed on the deviated path for the 

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Beam element & \(x\) position & Beam element & \(x\) position \\ \hline VLE target & -45219 & S2 & -7558, -7558, NA \\ \hline CHRV1 & -114294 & S3 & -7523, -7523, NA \\ \hline CHRV2,HE & -18677 & BC2 & -4813, -7590, NA \\ \hline CHRV2,VLE & -20677 & Pixel box & 146 \\ \hline SMV & -17677 & SCT & 512 \\ \hline BC-2 & -19862 (\(z\sim 511\)) & TRT1 & 1152 \\ \hline BC-1 & -13685 & LAr & 3768 (\(\eta=0\)) \\ \hline BC0 & -12540 & SC & 4568 \\ \hline BC1 & -9190 & TileCal & 4598 (\(\eta=0\)) \\ \hline S1 & -8843 & MuonWall & 7394 \\ \hline SMH & 8083, NA, NA & SMT & 20669 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: The distances are givenin mm, \(x(=y=z)0\), is at the front surface of the ID magnet. The position is given at the start of the Cherenkov’s. For the detectors it is as follows: front wall of Pixel box, geometrical center of the SCT box, center of the cylindrical arc of the TRT, start of LAr module, and start of the TileCal modules. Some of the Beamline instruments was in different position and is divided into three periods; Period1 from 2 August until 22 September, Period2 from 22 September until 3 November, and Period3 from 3 November until 15 of November. NA = Not Available in that run period. SMV is only used during VLE runs. * = values during the period when all three ID sub-detectors were present(10/9-11/10).

VLE mode, in both cases called CHRV2,(HE or VLE). The Cherenkov counters are used to identify the particle species.

The Cherenkov counters are filled with a gas, and when a charged particle travels trough the gas it will produce a wake of polarized molecules along its path. When the molecules depolarize they emit radiation in all directions. If the particle travels faster than the speed of light in the media the emitted radiation will become coherent in a certain direction(forward) and results in a significant amount of light produced. This effect will give rise to circular wave fronts. Figure 3 shows a simplified picture of the Cherenkov counters.

If \(v>c/n\) the angle, \(\theta_{c}\), between the emitted photons and the particle is given by:

\[cos\theta_{c}=1/n\beta \tag{1}\]

where \(n\) it the refractive index of the gas which is dependent on the gas pressure. The number of photons \(N\) emitted over a length L is approximately:

\[N=ALsin^{2}\theta_{c} \tag{2}\]

with \(A\) depending on quantum efficiencies, inefficiencies of the optical system, etc. Typical values of \(A\) are around 100 (\(A=100\) is the theoretical value for CHRV1 filled with Helium). These Cherenkov counters operate as threshold counters, thus only provide a signal whenever the velocity is above the threshold. For a given momentum the pressure in the gas can be set so the threshold velocity is only reached for particles below a certain mass, see figure 4.

The particle separation possible for Helium and Nitrogen g

Figure 3: The particles enters from the right into the gas medium, and if their velocity is above the threshold they will radiate photons. The number of photons per travelled length is given by the gas composition and its pressure, and the angle between the photons and the particle will be small. The photons will travel trough the medium to the end where a thin spherical mirror will reflect the photons down trough a plexiglas towards a PMT which will register the photons.

### Beamchambers

There are five beam chambers used to define the beam profile, these are designated BC-2 to BC2. BC-2 is placed on the low energy beamline just after the second Cherenkov chamber. BC-1 is placed after the last dipole magnet and BC0 is placed before the two quadrapole magnets. BC1 is placed after the last quadrapole magnet, and BC2 is placed after S2/S3.

The beamchamber type which is used is the Delay Wire Chamber (DWC), developed at the Beam instrumentation group at CERN. It works like any other Multi Wire Proportional Chamber. It is composed of two sandwic, each consisting of three planes, two cathode

Figure 4: The topmost figure shows the threshold pressure as a function of the beam momentum for Helium gas, and the lower figure for Nitrogen gas. The dotted line indicates the minimum and maximum pressure possible in the counters, 20 mbar and 3 bar, respectively.

planes surrounding an anode wire-plane. The cathode planes are built up by 55 wires each, with 2 mm spacing, which are perpendicular to the 28 wires, with 4 mm spacing, in the anode plane. A particle passing trough the chamber will ionize the gas and create free electrons and positive gas atoms. The high voltage between the anodes and cathodes will then accelerate the electrons toward the anode wires, where a multiplying avalanche takes place. At the same time an image current is induced in the cathode wires. The specialty of the DWC is that the position information is not taken from the anode wires but from the cathode wires where individual wires are connected to a tapped delay line. The signal from the cathode wires builds up two waves in the delay line, traveling in each direction. The waves are the integral sum of the different cathode wires according to the delay per tap of the delay line.

The anode signal is used as a common start and by measuring the time delay between the arrival of the waves at the two ends of the delay line the impact point of the particle can be determined. The time difference is measured by a Time to Digital Converter (TDC), and the space resolution is about ten times better than the wire spacing, about 200 \(\mu\)m. See figure 5 for a schematic of the readout of a chamber.

To get the full two dimensional position the cathode planes in the two sandwiches are orthogonal to each other.

### Scintillators

Starting upstreams, the first scintillator is placed just downstream of CHRV2(HE), on the high energy line, when running in VLE mode. In the VLE mode a secondary target is inserted in the beamline before the exit to the VLE path, and a beam dump is inserted after this exit to stop particles not bent into the VLE path. This scintillator, named Muon Veto (SMV), will tag unwanted muons coming from the straight high energy line. The dimensions of this scintillator is 81x34x2 cm\({}^{3}\), for the height, width, and thickness, respectively.

S0 is placed on the VLE line just after BC-2 and CHRV2(VLE), and is used for checking the beam intensity and quality, and also for the Time-Of-Flight (TOF), when running in VLE mode. The dimensions of S0 is 10x10x0.6 cm\({}^{3}\).

The S1 scintillator is placed just after BC1 and the last beamline magnet, and is used for checking the beam intensity and quality, and for the main trigger. The dimensions of S1 is 10x10x0.6 cm\({}^{3}\).

S2 and S3 are placed about halfway between BC1 and BC2, and are used for checking

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|} \hline Particles & Helium gas & Nitrogen gas \\ \hline \(\pi\)/e separation & up to 50 GeV & impossible \\ \hline \(\pi\)/K separation & up to 180 GeV & up to 100 GeV \\ \hline \(\pi\)/p separation & up to 250 GeV & up to 200 GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: The numbers are for theoretical efficiencies above 50% for the lighter particle at threshold pressure for the heavier particle. In case of nitrogen gas, the momentum range is usually limited by the pressure, whereas in the case of helium gas the limit is rather the drop in efficiency (except for \(\pi\)/e separation). Normal running conditions involve pressures of 20 mbar up to 3 bar.

the beam intensity and quality, and for the main trigger. These scintillators were both equipped with two PMT's.(In the very early running, in the combined calorimetry period, other scintillators were used for S2 and S3, which only had one PMT per scintillator.) The dimensions of S2 and S3 are 5.0x5.0x1.0 cm\({}^{3}\).

The Muon Halo (SMH) is placed just before S2 and S3, and is used for tagging halo muons and other particles. The dimensions of the SMH is 30x32x1.5 cm\({}^{3}\), with a hole of diameter 3.4 cm centered on the beam.

The Muon Tag (SMT) is placed further downstream after the first beamdump, and can be used as a muon trigger or as muon tag. The dimensions of the SMT is 40x40x2.0 cm\({}^{3}\).

During runs the individual rate of these scintillators are shown on a scaler, together with the main trigger rate, usually \(S1*S2*S3\), level 1 accept and level 1 reject. This makes it possible to check out the trigger rate, beam quality, the content of muons in the beam, and the number of halo particles.

#### 3.3.1 Tof

To supplement the Cherenkov counters at very low energy a Time Of Flight (TOF) measurement will be used this year to try to improve the particle identification. The S0 and S2/S3 scintillators and a fast TDC (Caen V775N) will be used for the TOF. The full scale range of the TDC is set to 140 ns with a least significant bit of 35 ps, i.e. the maximum time between a start and a stop signal and the time resolution, respectively. The length

Figure 5: The travelling wave is built up by adding the single inputs from the delay line.

between the two scintillators is approximately 10 meters. The particle separation depends on the momentum, mass, and the flight length. The flight time is given by:

\[t=\frac{L}{c}\times\sqrt{1+\frac{m^{2}c^{2}}{p^{2}}} \tag{3}\]

At a length of 10 m, the time difference between the different particles at energies below 5 GeV is given in Table 3.

As can be seen in Table 3 the time difference between the particles decrease rapidly with increasing energy and thus also the possible particle separation capability. The time resolution has not been measured, and depends on the speed of the scintillators and PMT's, the electronics (discriminators and Fan-in/Fan-out's), and on the TDC resolution. At energies below 4 GeV and with the expected time resolution it will most likely be possible to separate electrons, pions, and muons from kaons and protons. At 1 GeV there is a theoretical chance of separating electrons, pions, and muons, and at 5 GeV it is still possible to separate protons from all other particles.

## 4 Extra detectors - Cryostat Scintillator and Muon Wall

In order to study the effect of early showering and energy loss in the material in front of the hadronic calorimeter (the cryostat), and to be able to tag pions that do not shower before the Tile Calorimeter, a scintillator will be placed between the cryostat and the Tile modules. For studying the longitudinal leakage of hadronic showers scintillators are also placed behind the Tile modules.

The Cryostat scintillator (SC) is 2.0 cm thick and covers an area centered on the beam spot of 44 cm in width and almost all three modules in height (missing the last 5-10 cm of the topmost module due to space constraints, each module has an arch-length of 22 cm). This coverage is large enough to contain the majority of the particles from pions, for all energies, that starts to shower in the material upstreams. Maximal eta coverage is about 0.9.

The Muon Wall, placed about 1.5 m after the Tile modules, consists of 12 scintillators covering an area of about 120x80 cm\({}^{2}\). The Muon Wall is movable by a motor that can be remotely controlled and is also kept centered on the beam spot. Maximal eta position of the center of the Muon Wall is 0.45. The setup and performance of the Muon Wall in 1998 and 1999 Tile testbeams is found in this note [4].

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline P [GeV] & e/\(\mu\) & e/\(\pi\) & e/K & e/p & \(\mu/\pi\) & \(\mu/\)K & \(\mu/\)p & \(\pi/\)K & \(\pi/\)p & k/p \\ \hline
1 & 0.18 & 0.32 & 3.84 & 12.4 & 0.14 & 3.65 & 12.2 & 3.52 & 12.1 & 8.53 \\ \hline
2 & 0.05 & 0.08 & 1.00 & 3.48 & 0.04 & 0.95 & 3.44 & 0.92 & 3.40 & 2.48 \\ \hline
3 & 0.02 & 0.04 & 0.45 & 1.59 & 0.02 & 0.43 & 1.57 & 0.41 & 1.56 & 1.14 \\ \hline
4 & 0.01 & 0.02 & 0.25 & 0.90 & 0.01 & 0.24 & 0.89 & 0.23 & 0.88 & 0.65 \\ \hline
5 & 0.007 & 0.01 & 0.16 & 0.59 & 0.005 & 0.15 & 0.57 & 0.15 & 0.57 & 0.42 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: The time difference between the flight time of particles at a given energy, calculated for a flight length of 10 m. The time is given in ns.

For hadrons at high energies longitudinal leakage might occur. The Muon Wall can be used to tag these events. By selecting events with signal in the Muon Wall one can suppress the low energy tail of the reconstructed pions. The signals in the Muon Wall and the Tile samples can also be used to study different ways to recover the lost energy and reconstruct the true particle energy, and improve the energy resolution.

## 5 Trigger, readout and DAQ

At the testbeam the main beam trigger consists of scintillators S1, S2 and S3. The other scintillators, SMH, SMV and SMT, can also be used in the trigger logic. The Scintillator signals are sent via fast (4 ns/m) cables to a rack in one of the control rooms where the trigger logic is constructed. The signals are here split, using Fan-in/Fan-out's, and sent to the VME common (or beam) crate where the data acquisition hardware, ADC's and TDC's, etc..., is situated.

The trigger logic is constructed using NIM logic, so the signals from the scintillators are discriminated to give standard -0.7 V, NIM pulses, with appropriate widths. The signals will not arrive at the same time due to different cable lengths and position in the beamline. To time them together the signals are delayed using delay boxes (shielded cables of different lengths). The beam trigger is then constructed using coincidence, Fan-in/Fan-out, and timer units.

A beam particle which gives a signal in all the trigger scintillators will give rise to a Master trigger, and a Level 1 Accept (L1A), if there is no busy signal. A busy signal means that some segment of the data readout is busy, for example a detector ROD, or a ADC/TDC in the common crate. A busy signal will give a Level 1 Reject (L1R). The Master trigger will start the common crate TDC's, common start mode, and open up a gate for reading out the ADC's. All the scintillator signals are read out by an ADC, and the Up, Down, Left and Right signals from all the five beamchambers are read out by TDC's, and the scintillators used for the TOF are read out by a fast TDC. During data taking, between the spills (about 10 s), calibration triggers, as well as pedestals and CIS, can be taken.

When a L1A occurs all the detector elements have to be read out. This is done by TTCVi signals to the detector ROD's via a Local Trigger Processor (LTP), which gets a L1A from the emulated Central Trigger Processor (CTP), except when running in 25 ns mode. When running in 25 ns mode, the trigger resembles the real ATLAS trigger, with trigger towers in the hadron calorimeter, and also the muon trigger. Then the beam trigger is not used. Figure 6 gives a schematic overview of the trigger logic.

The common crate contains two ADC's, LeCroy lrs1182 (12 bits), three TDC's, one CAEN V775 (12 bits), and two LeCroy 1176 (16 bits). All beamline instrumentation are acquired here. The Muon Wall, the cryostat scintillator, the small extra e.m.calorimeter (Phantom), and the Laser/LED calibration are aquired by five ADC's (LeCroy's lrs1182) on the auxiliary (or Tile) crate, which also aquired the signals from the six drawers of the hadron calorimeter. During the EB run period the three extended barrel modules were aquired instead of the three barrel modules at \(\eta<0\). Both crates are equipped with single board computers to handle the trigger and readout.

The data from the common and auxiliary crate are readout by a Read Out Driver (ROD) emulator. While the drawers of the hadron calorimeter are read out by a ROD via optical cables, which is also the case for the other detectors.

From there the data is sent via Gigabit Ethernet to the Read Out System (ROS), which are PC's. The data is sent to the Event Filter (EF) machine via a SubFarm Input (SFI), where the detector fragments are put together to an event. The EF also does the offline triggering. The data is then sent to data storage via a SubFarm Output (SFO) machine, see figure 7. The readout off all the detectors are controlled by a common Data Flow Manager (DFM). The data could be monitored at different levels in the DAQ system by a special monitoring system running on a dedicated monitoring PC. Information on the monitoring program for the 2004 Tile standalone testbeam can be found in this paper [6].

The data from the beam instrumentation and extra detectors are saved in a raw binary format. For every event there is a header, then the data is divided into ROD fragments. For the common crate the data are divided into segments each representing an ADC or a TDC, each identified by a number, a board id, and then data words representing the channel numbers. The data format of the common crate and the auxiliary crate is found in the the end of this paper. Each segment has the following data format:

* word0: total number of words in the segment including this word
* word1: board identifier
* word2: data words (not all the channels are always present.)

## 6 Calibration and tests

### Scintillator tests

Scintillators utilize the ionization and excitation coming from the charged particles as they interact with the scintillating material to generate optical photons, which in turn are detected using Photo Multiplier Tubes (PMT's). A charged particle traversing a scintillator leaves behind a trail of excited molecules. Certain types of molecules will release a small fraction (3%) of this energy as optical photons. These initial photons are wave-shifted using fluors to shift light to a more convenient wavelength. Without fluors in the scintillator material the created photons from the ionization would be re-absorbed very quickly, which would give a very short attenuation length (10\({}^{-8}\) m).

The photons are usually reflected to the end (or ends) of the scintillator where PMT's are situated. The photons hit the PMT's photocathode and liberate electrons which are focused by an electric field to the first dynode. For most PMT's a negative voltage is applied to the photocathode. The anode is usually held at ground potential. The voltage between the anode and the cathode is subdivided by a chain of resistors to the other dynodes. The electrons are then accelerated from the first to the second dynode where more electrons are liberated, and so on. Normally there are about 8 to 15 dynodes with a voltage difference of about 100-150 V between each dynode.

To check the integrity of the scintillators and PMT efficiencies a testbench was built up. The easiest way to test a scintillator and its pm tube is by using other scintillators and setup a coincidence trigger, using for example cosmic radiation or a radioactive sample. The

Figure 7: The DAQ system at the testbeam.

cosmic radiation which consists of mostly hard radiation, muons, but also of softer particles as electrons and photons was used for the coincidence measurements. The total flux of this radiation is well known, and is about 110 \(m^{-2}s^{-1}sr^{-1}\) for the vertical flux and falls of as \(cos^{2}(\theta)\), where \(\theta\) is the angle from the vertical position.

Before testing the efficiency a High Voltage(HV) scan was done to select the right HV working point for the PMT. This can be done without using any coincidence, only cosmic radiation is needed. The signal from the PMT was discriminated, the threshold level was set to -30 mV, and then sent directly to a scaler. Starting at a "low" voltage, the rate of cosmic radiation was measured during a fixed time, which was dependent on the size of the scintillator to get enough statistics. The voltage was then increased in step, and the measurement repeated. This will give a curve as seen in figure 8, and the working point was taken in the middle of the "plateau".

At low voltage most signals from the PMT's will not reach threshold level. As the voltage is increased the rate will increase until the "plateau" is reached where the rate will flatten out, the proportional region. At higher voltages the PMT the rate will increase very fast due to that noise (like electronic noise, electrons ejected thermionically from the photocathode material, etc.) will be amplified enough to reach the threshold level, and the amplitude will no longer be proportional to the number of photons reaching the PMT. The rate at the working point was compared to the calculated expected rate from cosmic radiation. A too high rate could mean that the threshold was set too low giving a lot of noise or that there was a light-leak somewhere that had to be found and fixed.

Two coincidence scintillators (CS1 and CS2) were used to set up the testbench. CS1 is a small scintillator which could be moved about on top of the much larger scintillator to be tested. The size of CS1 is 3x3 cm\({}^{2}\) and for CS2 the SMH or SMV was used with a fixed distance between them. The scintillator (TS) to be tested was placed in between. The signals from the scintillators are first sent trough a discriminator to convert the PMT signals to NIM logic. The signals from CS1, CS2 and TS are then sent to an AND logic module

Figure 8: HV scan of the Muon Tag and Muon Halo scintillators, which also were used as CS2. The working points for both scintillators was set to 1850 V.

(CS1 and CS2 to one gate, and CS1, CS2 and TS to another). The signals from the two AND gates are then sent to a scaler, see figure 9.

The efficiency of TS is then given by:

\[\mathit{Eff}=\frac{CS1\times CS2}{CS1\times CS2\times TS} \tag{4}\]

The efficiencies of the scintillators were measured at different positions, length hs from the PMT's, to assure that there were no drastic change in efficiency due to attenuation problems. Table 4 shows the HV working points and efficiencies of the tested scintillators. S2 and S3 were completely new scintillators and PMT's, and S0 and S1 were fixed beamline scintillators which were tested with beam particles to be working properly.

### Beamchamber readout and calibration

There are seven outputs from each beam chamber, four cathode signals, Left, Right, Up, and Down, and three calibration inputs. The cathode signals are discriminated to NIM outputs and sent to a TDC in the common crate. The TDC uses a common start signal which is the main trigger signal. For an event the four time delays, from the four stop signals, Left, Right, Up, and Down, will be measured by the TDC. The absolute position of

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Scintillator & HV working point [V] & Min efficiency [\%] & Distance to the PMT [m] \\ \hline SMV & 1850 & 94.2 & 0.7 \\ \hline SMH & 1850 & 97.7 & 0.2 \\ \hline SC & 1700 & 99.9 & 0.7 \\ \hline SMT & 1850 & 99.1 & 0.3 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

the particle can then be calculated from the following formula:

X-position = (timeRight-timeLeft) \(\times\) horizontalSlope + horizontalOffset

Y-position = (timeUp-timeDown) \(\times\) verticalSlope + verticalOffset

The absolute position is indicated in millimeter's from the centre, the times are in nanoseconds, the slope is approximately 0.2 mm/ns, and the offset should be close to zero for a well placed chamber. The slope is given by the delay line, whereas the constant offset is determined by the propagation delay in cables and the properties of the chamber electronics. To know the slope and the offset with precision for a given set-up, a calibration is needed [5]

The beamchambers were calibrated using a test signal from a pulse generator. The test signal simulates a spill of particles at the same position in the beam chamber. The test pulse had a triangular shape with a rise time of 10 ns, a flat top of 20 ns, and a fall time of 60 ns. The amplitude was 40 mV in 50 ohms and a frequency of 10 kHz. Three series of data acquisitions with the TDC was taken for each beamchamber, while exciting the chamber at: \(-\)30 mm, the centre, and \(+\)30 mm, see figure 10. The active area of the chambers are 100x100 mm\({}^{2}\).

The values from the best linear fit to the test pulses give the offset and the slope, which can be inserted into the formula above. The results of the calibration measurements of all

the beam chambers can be seen in table 5.
