## 1 Introduction

The successful completion of Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Run 2 has provided the ATLAS experiment with an unprecedented amount of data (around \(140\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)) of \(pp\) collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV. Being the heaviest known elementary particle of the Standard Model (SM), the top quark has a large coupling to the SM Higgs boson and is predicted to have large couplings to hypothetical new particles in many models beyond the SM (BSM). In that respect, rare processes involving the top quark are particularly relevant to study. Some of these processes, which were previously considered as negligible backgrounds in searches for new physics or were themselves the subject of searches, now have been or can be measured. Irrespective of whether these rare processes are a signal or a background to an analysis, the evaluation of their modelling uncertainties is a relevant topic in order to exploit the full potential of LHC data. Already now some of the current experimental results are limited by these theoretical modelling uncertainties. This note documents modelling studies for five processes: \(t\bar{t}W\), \(t\bar{t}Z/\gamma^{*}\), \(t\bar{t}H\), \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) and \(tWZ\). Several studies have been carried out to improve ATLAS Monte Carlo (MC) simulations of these processes, including higher order effects both in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and electroweak (EW) using next-to-leading-order (NLO) inclusive and multileg merged setups. For most of these processes, next-to-next-to-leading-order (NNLO) in QCD predictions are not expected for several years and so it is important to extract the most out of the current technology. Different MC event generators and configurations have been compared and the studies are documented in this note. The content of each section follows the same structure: description of the configurations of the MC samples, inclusive cross-section predictions and differential predictions.

## 2 Modelling of the \(t\bar{t}W\) process

The production of top quark pairs in association with \(W\) bosons (\(t\bar{t}W\) process) can lead to final states that contain same-sign charged leptons and multi-lepton final states, making it a background in BSM searches and measurements of rare SM processes (such as \(t\bar{t}H\) and \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) production). Furthermore, this process is also very interesting due to its rich phenomenological applications. The presence of the \(W\) boson polarises the incoming quark-line and in turn the outgoing \(t\bar{t}\) pair [1]. Top quark charge asymmetry and polarisation in \(t\bar{t}W\) production can additionally offer a useful handle to explore new physics effects [2]. Additionally, the \(t\bar{t}Wj\) process (with \(tW\ \to\ tW\) scattering diagrams) is sensitive to non-standard top-\(Z\) couplings, which are currently weakly constrained [3].

\(t\bar{t}W\) production rates have been measured at the LHC, either as inclusive cross-sections [4; 5] or normalisation factors [6; 7; 8; 9], and several measurements yield values larger than the SM predictions [10]. These enhanced rates motivate further study of this process.

It is very challenging to model \(t\bar{t}W\) process from the theoretical point of view. Higher order effects, both in the QCD strong coupling constant \(\alpha_{S}\) and EW coupling constant \(\alpha\), are very important for \(t\bar{t}W\) production.

The complete-NLO \(t\bar{t}W\) cross-section can be decomposed into the following contributions:

\[\begin{split}\sigma_{QCD+EW}^{NLO}=\sigma_{QCD}^{NLO}&+ \delta\sigma_{EW}\\ \sigma_{QCD}^{NLO}&=\underbrace{\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S }^{2}\alpha)}_{\text{LO QCD}}+\underbrace{\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S}^{3}\alpha)}_{ \text{NLO QCD}}\\ \delta\sigma_{EW}&=\underbrace{\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S }^{2}\alpha^{2})}_{\text{NLO EW}}+\underbrace{\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{3})+ \mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S}\alpha^{3})}_{\text{tree-level EW}}+\underbrace{\mathcal{ O}(\alpha^{4})}_{\text{negligible}}\end{split} \tag{1}\]

Figure 1 shows example Feynman diagrams for these QCD and EW contributions. At leading-order (LO) only \(q\bar{q}\) channels are present. The gluon-induced (\(qg\) and \(gg\)) channels appear at higher perturbative orders and give sizeable contributions to the cross-section (\(\sim 50\%\)). Note that the \(gg\) channel starts contributing only at NNLO QCD for \(t\bar{t}W\) production1. The non-vanishing EW corrections include three types of terms: "NLO EW" corrections (\(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S}^{2}\alpha^{2})\)), "tree-level EW" contributions (\(\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{3})+\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S}\alpha^{3})\)) and other negligible contributions. While the \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S}\alpha^{3})\) term is a subleading \(\mathcal{O}(0.1\%)\) electroweak contribution for many processes, it is not as negligible for \(t\bar{t}W\) production \(\mathcal{O}(10\%)\) due to the \(tW\to\ tW\) scattering contributions (see the three diagrams in the bottom right part of Fig. 1), as reported in Refs. [11; 3; 3].

Footnote 1: However, it is important to mention that it is included in the real emission diagrams from the \(t\bar{t}W\) +1\(j\)@NLO matrix elements.

The cross-section for \(t\bar{t}W\) production has been computed to NLO QCD+EW accuracy (up to \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S}^{3}\alpha)\) and \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S}^{2}\alpha^{2})\)) [12] using a fixed scale \(\mu=(2m_{\text{top}}+m_{\text{W}})/2\) and documented in the CERN Yellow Report 4 [10]: \(\sigma(t\bar{t}W)\) = 600.8\({}^{+13\%}_{-12\%}\) fb, where the uncertainties are from variations of renormalisation and factorisation scales (\(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\)), parton distribution function (PDF) and \(\alpha_{S}\). The top quark and the electroweak vector boson are treated as stable particles in the narrow-width approximation. Major efforts have been undertaken to improve this calculation. As already mentioned, complete-NLO corrections (including also the tree-level EW terms) [11; 1] have been computed. Furthermore, soft gluon resummation up to next-to-next-to-leading logarithm (NNLL) in perturbative QCD [13; 14; 15] and including EW contributions has become available. In one of those studies [15], a more conservative estimate of the theoretical uncertainty (\({}^{+26\%}_{-16\%}\)) derived considering alternative choices for the scale functional form to compute the envelope is suggested. Recently,complete top quark off-shell effects and the NLO QCD corrections to top quark decays for fully leptonic decay modes [16] have been derived and these effects have been found to be rather small (less than 5%).

In this section, several developments aimed to improve ATLAS \(t\bar{t}W\) MC simulations by including QCD effects using NLO merged configurations and the tree-level EW contributions have been documented.

### \(t\bar{t}W\) QCD production: NLO inclusive and multileg merged setups

Two different MC event generators have been studied for \(t\bar{t}W\) production. A first set of MC samples is generated using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.6.7 [17] (referred to as MG5_aMC in the tables and plots of this note) using a five-flavour scheme and two different configurations: one with NLO inclusive matrix-elements and MC@NLO [18] matching to the parton shower (referred to as "NLOinc"), and one with NLO multileg merging using the FxFx algorithm [19] (referred to as "FxFx") using NLO-accurate matrix elements for up to one additional jet and LO-accurate matrix elements for up to two additional jets (\(t\bar{t}W\) +0,1\(j\)@NLO +2\(j\)@LO). The inclusive configuration makes use of a dynamical functional form of \(H_{T}/2\) for the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales in the matrix elements (ME) and for the shower starting scale \(\mu_{\rm sh}\) (also referred to as resummation scale), where

\[H_{T}=\sum_{i}m_{T,i}=\sum_{i}\sqrt{m_{i}^{2}+p_{T,i}^{2}}\,, \tag{2}\]

and where \(i\) runs over all outgoing partons from the ME calculation. The multileg configuration makes use of complex functional forms for the \(\mu_{R}\), \(\mu_{F}\) and \(\mu_{\rm sh}\) scales which are chosen dynamically and depend on the kinematics of the event after the merging of the core process with the additional partons following the FxFx merging prescription2[19, 20, 21]. In both samples, the decay of the top quarks (and its decay product \(W\) boson) and of the associated \(W\) boson is performed at LO with MadSpin[22, 23], preserving spin-correlations and polarization effects. The top quark mass is set to \(m_{\rm top}=172.5\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) and the \(W\) boson mass to \(m_{\rm W}=80.399\,\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\). The Pythia 8.244 [24] MC event generator is used for the parton showering (PS), hadronization and underlying event using the A14 set of tuned parameters [25]. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons are simulated using the EvtGen v.1.7.0 [26]. The PDFs used are NNPDF3.0NLO [27] and NNPDF2.3LO [28] for the ME and PS respectively.

Footnote 2: They depend on the phase-space configuration and are related to the clustering scales of the additional partons and on the core process.

Within the multileg configurations, there are two additional parameters. The merging scale parameter (\(\mu_{Q}\)) is used in the matching of a matrix element with the parton shower. It sets a threshold to determine what part of the phase-space is filled by the parton shower or the matrix element generator. In other words, additional partons beyond ME-level accuracy and below the merging scale threshold are described by the parton shower. The other parameter is the minimum jet \(p_{\rm T}\) (ptj) of the additional parton in the ME generation. The \(\mu_{Q}\) and ptj values are set to 30 GeV and 8 GeV respectively.

Table 1 summarizes these setups and shows their respective cross-sections. Several interesting observations can be extracted from MadGraph5_aMC@NLO predictions. Higher jet multiplicities that enter at \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S}^{4}\alpha)\) in the multileg samples (\(t\bar{t}W\) +1\(j\)@NLO matrix element) enhance the cross-section by about 10%. As pointed out before, another increase of the same order is obtained due to the tree-level EW contributions.

Another MC event generator has also been studied for \(t\bar{t}W\) QCD production: the Sherpa 2.2.8 [29] generator using NLO-accurate matrix elements for up to one additional jet and LO-accurate matrix elements for up to two additional jets in the strong coupling constant (\(t\bar{t}W\)\(+0,1j@\)NLO\(+2j@\)LO, same as FxFx sample). The additional parton emissions are matched and merged with the Sherpa parton shower based on Catani-Seymour dipole factorisation [30; 31] using the MEPS@NLO prescription [32; 33; 34; 20]. The virtual QCD correction for matrix elements at NLO accuracy are provided by the OpenLoops 2 library [35; 36; 37; 38]. Samples are generated using the NNPDF3.0NNLO set [27], along with the dedicated set of tuned parton-shower parameters developed by the Sherpa authors. The \(\mu_{R}\), \(\mu_{F}\) and \(\mu_{sh}\) scales used for the core process are set to \(H_{T}/2\) and the CKKW merging scale is set to 30 GeV. Multijet merging at NLO accuracy in the electroweak coupling is based on the NLO EW\({}_{\rm virt}\) approach [39; 40; 41]. The calculation is performed in the \(G_{\mu}\) scheme, ensuring an optimal description of pure EW interactions at the EW scale. The EW contributions included in this sample can be accessed via multiple event weights. The scale variations in this sample are coherently varied in both the ME and in the PS.

In order to evaluate the importance of missing higher order corrections, the dependence of the cross-section on the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales in the ME has been studied for three different functional forms: two dynamical scales, an arithmetic mean \(\mu_{a,0}=H_{T}/2=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}m_{T,i}\) (nominal scale used and default in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO event generator for NLO inclusive configurations) and a geometric mean \(\mu_{g,0}=\sqrt{m_{T,t}\cdot\ m_{T,\bar{t}}\cdot\ m_{T,\bar{W}}}\), and a fixed scale \(\mu_{m,0}=(2m_{\rm top}+m_{\rm W})/2\). This dependence is shown on the left plot of Figure 2 for the NLO inclusive configuration, by keeping \(\mu=\mu_{R}=\mu_{F}\) and varying it by a factor four around the nominal \(\mu_{0}\) value for each functional form. In each point, \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) are independently varied by a factor of two around the central value using 7-point variations. For reference, the latest ATLAS \(t\bar{t}W\) measurement [5] is also shown. A few interesting observations can be derived from this plot. Higher cross-sections are obtained for a fixed scale, which was the choice for the calculation in Ref. [10], and for a geometric mean dynamical scale. The obtained cross-sections for \(\mu_{m,0}\) (\(612.4^{+11.4\%}_{-0.7\%}\) fb) and \(\mu_{g,0}\) (\(617.1^{+11.6\%}_{-10.8\%}\) fb) are very similar to the ones obtained for the FxFx sample (\(614.2^{+11.8\%}_{-12.6\%}\) fb). The \(t\bar{t}W\) NLO inclusive cross-section shows a strong dependence on the scale choice with a \(20-30\%\) increase in the predicted cross-section value when comparing the \(\mu_{0}/4\) point with the nominal value \(\mu_{0}\) for all three functional forms. A wider central scale range to compute the envelope (beyond the conventional range \(0.5\leq\mu_{R}/\mu_{0},\mu_{F}/\mu_{0}\leq 2\), with 7-point variations) is considered in order to assess the uncertainties due to

Table 1: A summary of the \(t\bar{t}W\) samples studied in this note. The matrix element generator, parton shower generator and tuned parameters and the corresponding PDF sets used are given. Additional information regarding the matching and merging scheme used by the ME+PS setup is provided. The MG5_aMC tree-level EW contribution (\(\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{3})+\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S}\alpha^{3})\)) is also reported and is discussed in the next section. For MG5_aMC, the perturbative scale uncertainties (\(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\)) in the ME using 7-point variations (obtained by varying up and down by a factor of two independently and coherently) are quoted. For Sherpa 2.2.8, the same procedure is applied but scale uncertainties include variations in both the ME and the PS. The PDF uncertainties are below 2%.

missing higher orders, obtaining \(\pm(10-12)\%\), \(\pm(25-30)\%\) and \(\pm(30-50)\%\) when varying the scales up and down by a factor 2, 4 and 8 respectively.

For the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 FxFx sample, different values of the merging scale and the minimum jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the additional parton have been scanned following the recommendation of the authors to use values such that \(2\times\tt{ptj}\leq\mu_{Q}\)[19]. A small dependence (below 5%) of the cross-section on these parameters is observed, as can be seen on the right plot of Figure 2 and in Table 2. The effect of the merging scale on the cross-section indicates that opening the phase-space to the soft collinear emissions of the parton shower yields to slightly higher cross-section values.

For all the plots shown in the note, the top quarks and associated bosons are defined at parton-level, while jets at particle-level. The jets are reconstructed with the anti-\(k_{t}\)[42] algorithm with \(R=0.4\), using all stable particles, excluding prompt leptons and prompt neutrinos. Those jets which are ghost-matched [43] to a \(B\)-hadron with \(p_{T}\) larger than 5 GeV are referred to as \(b\)-jets. For the kinematic distributions shown in this section, events are required to have a \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}q\bar{q}l\nu\) semileptonic decay and a leptonic decay of the associated \(W\) boson \(W\to l\nu\), being the two charged leptons of the same sign3. The final state is expected to have two same sign leptons and at least four jets, two of them originating from \(b\) quarks. Kinematic cuts are applied to the jets and \(b\)-jets: to have \(p_{T}(j)>25\) GeV and to be in the central pseudo-rapidity region (\(|\eta(j)|<2.5\)). The leptons are required to originate from the decay of the \(W\) bosons and no fiducial requirements are applied.

Footnote 3: This requirement is applied at parton level using MC record, but no explicit event selection in terms of number of leptons, jets or \(b\)-jets is required

Figure 2: \(t\bar{t}W\) cross-sections at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV obtained with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8. (Left) For the NLO inclusive samples, the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales in the ME are varied by factors of \(1/4\), \(1/2\), \(2\) and \(4\) with respect to their respective nominal values (\(\mu_{0}\)) for all functional forms: \(\mu_{m}\) (blue), \(\mu_{g}\) (red), \(\mu_{a}\) (green). (Right) Merging scale and \(\tt{ptj}\) variations for the FxFx sample compared to the NLO inclusive sample with \(\mu_{a}=H_{T}/2\). The latest ATLAS measurement of the \(t\bar{t}W\) inclusive cross-section is also shown for reference in the cyan band. The error bars of each of the predicted cross-sections represent the scale uncertainty estimated by varying the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales in the ME within the conventional range \(0.5\leq\mu_{R}/\mu_{0}\), \(\mu_{F}/\mu_{0}\leq 2\) using 7-point variations.

The effect of \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scale variations in the ME on the shape of some kinematic variables has also been studied. Figure 3 shows some kinematic variables for the NLO inclusive samples with \(\mu_{a}=H_{T}/2\) and \(\mu_{a}=H_{T}/8\), and the nominal FxFx multileg sample. The distributions are normalised to their respective cross-sections. There are visible differences in the shapes of the distributions when comparing the \(t\bar{t}W\) NLO inclusive with \(\mu_{a}=H_{T}/2\) and the other setups. A higher jet multiplicity is observed in the multileg sample with a larger than 20% increase for events with \(N_{\rm jets}\geq~{}6\). Harder leading jet and \(t\bar{t}\) system \(p_{\rm T}\) distributions are also predicted by the multileg setup, as well as a different angular azimuthal separation between the two top quarks. Similarly to what is seen in Figure 2 (left), the dependence on the scale choice in the ME is large in the NLO inclusive samples. In addition, the NLO inclusive sample with \(\mu_{a}=H_{T}/8\) shows a good agreement with the multileg sample. Therefore, selecting lower values of the central scale in the ME for NLO inclusive configurations, at least for the scale values compared here, also mimics the behaviour of the higher accuracy FxFx sample.

Figure 4 presents the jet multiplicity and the leading jet \(p_{\rm T}\) for different values of \(\mu_{Q}\) in FxFx multileg samples. The choice of the value of the \(\mu_{Q}\) parameter is rather small for these kinematic variables.

Figure 5 shows comparisons of two NLO multileg samples generated with different MC event generators: MadGraph5_aMC@NLO interfaced to Pythia 8 and Sherpa 2.2.8. The uncertainty band in these plots represents an estimate of the missing higher order uncertainties obtained from variations of the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) perturbative scales in the ME and propagated in a correlated way to the PS (\(\mu_{R,F}^{\rm ME}=\mu_{R,F}^{\rm PS}\))4. The distribution for the multiplicity of jets is slightly different, well within scale uncertainties. A smaller \(b\)-jet multiplicity and softer leading jet spectrum is seen for the FxFx samples with respect to the Sherpa sample. The spectrum of the sixth jet in the event, which corresponds to the second additional jet and enters at LO accuracy in these MC samples, is compatible within uncertainties. This Sherpa sample has also been compared with previous versions (Sherpa 2.2.1) and the shapes of the distributions are found to be very similar.

Footnote 4: In the case of MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 sample, the scales in the PS are changed by varying “SpaceShower:renormMultFac” and “TimeShower:renormMultFac” settings in Pythia 8.

For Sherpa, the red shaded band includes scale variations both in ME and PS.

### \(t\bar{t}W\) EW production

Contributions from \(t\bar{t}W\) EW production have been recently calculated and found to increase the total \(t\bar{t}W\) cross-section by about 10% [1; 11], more than naively expected. This is caused by the appearance of \(tW\to tW\) scattering diagrams, as those on the bottom right of Figure 1. Using the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO event generator, a separate sample has been simulated to account for these tree-level EW contributions5 and its cross-section is found to be \(\sigma=49.1^{+19.1\%}_{-14.8\%}\)(scale) \(\pm 1.2\%\)(PDF) fb (see Table 1). Note the large uncertainty associated to the scale choice. In a similar way to the studies presented before for \(t\bar{t}W\) QCD production, the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales in the ME have been varied for a fixed (\(\mu_{m}\)) and a dynamical (\(\mu_{a}\)) functional form, as shown in Figure 6. The cross-section predictions show a strong dependence on the scale choice and higher values are obtained when using a fixed scale. In comparison to the nominal value of these scales, moving to a lower scale increases the cross-section by 40%. A 10% increase in the cross-section is seen throughout the whole range with respect to the NLO QCD inclusive samples described in Section 2.1. It can be noted that by using a lower scale such as \(\mu_{m,0}/4\) and adding the EW contribution, the total predicted cross-section agrees well with the latest experimental measurement.

Footnote 5: The command used in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO is “p p \(>\) tt\(\sim\) w QCD=0 QED=3 [QCD]” and includes \(\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{3})+\mathcal{O}(\alpha_{S}\alpha^{3})\) terms. The \(\mu_{R}\), \(\mu_{F}\) and \(\mu_{\rm sh}\) scales are set to \(H_{T}/2\) and the ME are interfaced to Pythia 8 with A14 tune. The PDF sets used are NNPDF3.0NLO [27] and NNPDF2.3LO [28] for the ME and PS respectively.

Figure 7 shows the effect of the tree-level EW contributions on top of the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO NLO QCD inclusive sample for some kinematic distributions. For these plots similar selection requirements as those described in the previous section are used, except for the jets pseudo-rapidity. The jets in the forward region (\(2.5<|\eta(j)|<4.5\)) are referred to as forward jets. The observables shown are the jet multiplicity and leading jet \(p_{\rm T}\) (separately for central and forward jets), the pseudo-rapidity of the most forward jet and \(|\Delta\eta|\) of the di-jet pair with maximum invariant mass. The EW contributions have a 20% effect for events with \(N_{\rm central~{}jets}\geq~{}6\), in the multiplicity of forward jets and in the high pseudo-rapidity region. This can be understood since the additional jet produced in the \(tW\rightarrow~{}tW\) scattering (the final state \(q^{\prime}\) in the three bottom right Feynman diagrams of Figure 1) is expected to be in the forward region. This shows that inclusive scaling factors are not sufficient and EW contribution should be included in the simulations explicitly where possible.

Figure 8 shows similar distributions using Sherpa 2.2.8 MC generator, so the tree-level EW contributions are applied on top of the MEPS@NLO QCD predictions. In this case, the cross-section increase due to the tree-level EW terms is about 5%. Compared to the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO distributions, the EW contributions are also visible in the forward region but the effect on the jet multiplicity is slightly different. Overall, the addition of this contribution does not change the kinematic distributions outside of the perturbative scale uncertainties shown (which include variations in the ME and in the PS).

Figure 6: (Left) \(t\bar{t}W\) cross-sections at \(\sqrt{s}\) = 13 TeV obtained with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 for two different functional forms. The tree-level EW (\(O(\alpha^{3}+\alpha_{S}\alpha^{3})\)) contribution is added on top of the NLO QCD (\(O(\alpha_{S}^{2}\alpha+\alpha_{S}^{3}\alpha)\)) one where indicated. The \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales in the ME are varied by factors of \(1/4\), \(1/2\), \(2\) and \(4\) with respect to their respective nominal values (\(\mu_{0}\)) for the two functional forms. (Right) Same scale variations but only comparing the tree-level EW cross-section predictions. The error bars of each of the predicted cross-sections represent the scale uncertainty estimated by varying the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales in the ME within the conventional range \(0.5\leq\mu_{R}/\mu_{0},\mu_{F}/\mu_{0}\leq 2\) using 7-point variations.

Events are required to have a \(t\bar{t}\) pair semileptonic decay and a leptonic \(W\) boson decay, producing two charged leptons of the same sign.

## 3 Modelling of the \(t\bar{t}Z\)/\(\gamma^{*}\) process

The \(t\bar{t}Z\) production process provides direct access to the neutral coupling of the top quark to massive gauge bosons. In addition, it could be sensitive to new physics effects in the EW symmetry breaking mechanism which could be probed, for instance, in the context of Effective Field Theory (EFT) [44]. Furthermore, it is an important background for BSM searches with invisible final states. The \(t\bar{t}Z\) inclusive cross-section measurements have now reached a precision of 8% and first differential measurements have recently become available using LHC Run 2 data [45, 46].

In the ATLAS MC samples, the \(Z/\gamma^{*}\) leptonic decays are calculated within the matrix elements (\(t\bar{t}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\)) and include spin-correlations and off-shell \(Z\) boson effects (with \(m_{\ell^{+}\ell^{-}}>5\,\mathrm{GeV}\)). Two different MadGraph5_aMC@NLO configurations using a five-flavour scheme are studied at NLO in \(\sigma_{S}\): one with NLO inclusive matrix-elements with MC@NLO matching, and one with multileg merging using FxFx with up to one additional parton at NLO6. The inclusive configuration uses a dynamical functional form for the central \(\mu_{R}\), \(\mu_{F}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{sh}}\) scales set to \(H_{T}/2\), while the multileg configuration makes use of a complex functional form already described in Section 2.1.

Footnote 6: Since \(t\bar{t}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}+1j\)@NLO matrix-elements are included, \(t\bar{t}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}+2j\) has LO accuracy. However, unlike for \(t\bar{t}W\) process, the \(+2j\)@LO is not added explicitly as a separate process within the merging.

The decay of the top quarks (and its decay product \(W\) boson) is performed at LO with MadSpin. The Pythia 8.244 MC event generator is used for the parton showering, hadronisation and underlying event using the A14 tune. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons are simulated using the EvtGen v.1.7.0. The PDFs used are NNPDF3.0NLO and NNPDF2.3LO for the ME and PS respectively, and a five-flavour scheme is used.

In addition, samples of \(t\bar{t}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) have been simulated with the Sherpa 2.2.1 event generator using also two configurations: NLO inclusive and NLO multileg with up to one additional parton at NLO, as done for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO. The PDFs used for both the ME and PS is NNPDF3.0NNLO, and a five-flavour scheme is used. The core \(\mu_{R}\), \(\mu_{F}\) and \(\mu_{\mathrm{sh}}\) scales are also set to \(\mu=H_{T}/2\).

Table 3 summarizes the configurations of the four \(t\bar{t}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) samples. Similarly to what was seen for \(t\bar{t}W\) production, higher jet multiplicities included in the \(t\bar{t}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}+1j\)@NLO matrix element enhance its cross-section by about 8%.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline \hline ME & Parton & ME PDF & Tune & Matching/Merging & Cross-section (fb) \\  & Shower & PS PDF & & & \\ \hline MG5\_aMC v2.6.7 & & & & MC@NLO & \(110.6^{+9.6\%}_{-11.0\%}\)(scale) \\ @NLO inc. & Pythia & NNPDF3.0NLO & & A14 & \begin{tabular}{c} FxFx Merging \\ \(\mu_{Q}=30\) GeV \\ \end{tabular} & \(118.9^{+5.1\%}_{-10.0\%}\)(scale) \\ \hline Sherpa 2.2.1 & & & & MC@NLO & \(120.4^{+8.0\%}_{-9.2\%}\)(scale) \\ @NLO inc. & Sherpa & NNPDF3.0NNLO & Author’s & & \\ \hline Sherpa 2.2.1 & 2.2.1 & NNPDF3.0NNLO & Tune &

\end{table}
Table 3: A summary of \(t\bar{t}\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) samples studied in this note. The PDF uncertainties are below 2%.

The theoretical reference cross-section for \(t\bar{t}Z\) process (including all \(Z\) boson decay modes) is \(\sigma(t\bar{t}Z)\) = \(880^{+10\%}_{-12\%}\,\mathrm{fb}\) where the uncertainties are from QCD scale variations, PDF and \(\sigma_{S}\). This is based on the calculation documented in the Yellow Report 4 [10] (based on Ref. [12]), which predicts \(\sigma(t\bar{t}Z)\) = \(839.6^{+10\%}_{-12\%}\,\mathrm{fb}\) and includes NLO QCD+EW corrections, plus a small correction to account for off-shell effects. More recently, new calculations have become available: complete-NLO predictions [47] and NNLL in the strong coupling [15, 48]. These effects are found to be rather small for \(t\bar{t}Z\) process.

Figure 9 compares the distributions of some observables for the different configurations for \(t\bar{t}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). Events are required to have a \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}q\bar{q}l\nu\) semileptonic decay and a leptonic \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) boson decay. The final state is expected to have three charged leptons and at least four jets, two of them originating from \(b\) quarks. The selection cuts for jets are \(p_{T}(j)>25\) and \(|\eta(j)|<2.5\). The distributions are normalised to their respective cross-sections.

There are clear differences between the inclusive and multileg samples. The latter show higher jet multiplicity (about 40% for events with \(N_{\mathrm{jets}}>~{}6\)), as well as harder jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions. This effect can be seen for the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the leading jet and of the fifth jet in the event, which corresponds to the first additional jet and enters at NLO (LO) in these multileg (inclusive) MC samples. This Sherpa sample has also been compared with previous versions (Sherpa 2.2.1) and the shapes of the distributions are found to be very similar. Overall, both multileg samples show good agreement between them. On the other hand, larger differences are seen among the two inclusive samples where a slightly higher jet multiplicity and harder leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) (within the scale uncertainties) are predicted by Sherpa with respect to MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8. For the rest of the shown observables (azimuthal distance between the two leptons from the \(Z\) boson, mass of the \(t\bar{t}Z\) system and \(Z\) boson \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)), all configurations studied are in good agreement.

All distributions are normalised to their respective cross-sections and the following selection cuts are applied: \(t\bar{t}\to\) semileptonic and \(Z\to\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\). The bottom panels show the ratio with respect to the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO inclusive sample. The vertical error lines represent the statistical errors and the shaded band represents the scale uncertainty estimated by varying the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales in the ME within the conventional range \(0.5\leq\mu_{R}/\mu_{0}\), \(\mu_{F}/\mu_{0}\leq 2\) using 7-point variations.

[MISSING_PAGE_FAIL:18]

7, respectively. For the four MC samples, the decays of bottom and charm hadrons are simulated using EvtGen v.1.6.0 (for Powheg samples) or v.1.7.0 (for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO samples). Comparing the cross-sections predicted by the two MadGraph5_aMC@NLO samples, one can see that higher jet multiplicities included in the \(t\bar{t}H\)+1\(j\bar{\varrho}\)NLO matrix element enhance the \(t\bar{t}H\) cross-section by about 9%. Similarly to the effect discussed in Section 2.1, higher cross-sections are obtained when using a geometric dynamical scale as is the case of these Powheg samples.

The current cross-section reference used by ATLAS is calculated at NLO QCD and NLO EW accuracy using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO [12, 68, 69], as reported in the Yellow Report 4 [10]. The predicted value is \(507^{+7\%}_{-10\%}\) fb, where the uncertainties are from variations of renormalisation and factorisation scales and PDF, as well as \(\alpha_{\mathrm{S}}\) variations. Recently, new calculations including complete-NLO predictions [47] and NNLL in QCD [70, 71] have become available. The NLO QCD off-shell and non-resonant corrections are also available for particular decay channels [72, 73]. These effects lead to minor changes in the theoretical precision of the predicted \(t\bar{t}H\) cross-section.

Figure 10 compares the distributions of some observables for the different configurations. Events are required to have a \(t\bar{t}\to b\bar{b}q\bar{q}l\nu\) semileptonic decay and with the Higgs boson decaying into a pair of \(b\) quarks (\(H\to\ b\bar{b}\)), since this is the dominant Higgs boson decay mode. The final state topology is expected to have one lepton and at least six jets, four of them originating from \(b\) quarks. The selection cuts for jets are \(p_{T}(j)>25\) GeV and \(|\eta(j)|<2.5\). The distributions are normalised to their respective cross-sections.

A higher jet multiplicity, as well as a smaller azimuthal separation between the top and anti-top quarks, is observed for the Powheg and MadGraph5_aMC@NLO FxFx NLO merged samples with respect to MadGraph5_aMC@NLO inclusive. In addition, significant differences between the two Powheg and the two MadGraph5_aMC@NLO samples are seen for the leading jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(H_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{jets}}\) (the scalar sum of the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the jets) distributions. Powheg predicts harder jets, which might be due to the different functional form used of the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales in the ME. Regarding the Higgs-related variables, the distribution of the Higgs transverse momentum, an observable used for the simplified template cross-section measurements, shows a mild dependence on the choice of the event generators for the hard-scattering and for the showering, hadronisation and underlying event. The \(\Delta R\) between the \(b\bar{b}\) pair coming from the Higgs boson decay shows quite good agreement between the four samples. To summmarie, the effect of the PS choice on the studied observables is significantly smaller than the difference between the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO and Powheg setups.

All distributions are normalised to their respective cross-sections. The \(t\bar{t}\rightarrow\) semileptonic and \(H\to b\bar{b}\) decay modes are required leading to a final state that is expected to have one lepton and at least six jets. The bottom panels show the ratio with respect to the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO inclusive sample. The vertical error lines represent the statistical errors and the shaded band represents the scale uncertainty estimated by varying the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales in the ME within the conventional range \(0.5\leq\mu_{R}/\mu_{0},\mu_{F}/\mu_{0}\leq 2\) using 7-point variations.

## 5 Modelling of the \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) process

The production of four top quarks (\(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\)) is one of the most spectacular signatures that can be produced at the LHC. It is a very energetic process (4 \(m_{\rm top}\sim 700\) GeV). Although it has not been observed yet, there is experimental evidence for this process [9]. It offers an indirect way to access the top Yukawa coupling and is sensitive to new physics [74].

Three MC samples for \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) production at NLO have been generated, as summarised in Table 5.

The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) samples are generated at NLO in QCD with a renormalisation and factorisation scales defined as \(H_{T}/4\), while the shower starting scale is set to \(H_{T}/2\). The PDF set used for the ME is NNPDF3.0NLO. The top quarks are decayed at LO using MadSpin to preserve spin-correlations. The sample is interfaced to the Pythia 8.230 parton shower using the A14 set of tuned parameters and NNPDF2.3LO PDF set. The decays of bottom and charm hadrons are simulated using EvtGen v.1.6.0. An alternative MadGraph5_aMC@NLO sample has also been simulated using Herwig 7.0.4 for the showering and hadronisation, with the H7UE set of tuned parameters and the MMHT2014LO PDF set.

Furthermore, another \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) sample has been generated at NLO accuracy in QCD with the Sherpa 2.2.8 generator using Amegic and Comix [29] libraries, while OpenLoops 2 library [35, 36, 37, 38] provides the external loop-amplitudes. The PDF set used for the matrix element calculation is NNPDF3.0NNLO with a dedicated PS tuning developed by the Sherpa authors. As for the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO samples, the \(\mu_{R}\) and \(\mu_{F}\) scales are set to \(H_{T}/4\), while the shower starting scale is defined as \(H_{T}/2\).

The \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) cross-section is currently known at complete-NLO accuracy (including EW corrections) using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO framework and is calculated as \(11.97^{+18\%}_{-21\%}\,\mathrm{fb}\)[11], where the uncertainties are estimated by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scales in the range \(0.5\leq\mu_{R}/\mu_{0}\), \(\mu_{F}/\mu_{0}\leq 2\) using 7-point variations.

Figure 11 shows comparisons between the three different configurations, including the impact of varying the factorisation and renormalisation scales for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 and Sherpa samples in the range \(0.5\leq\mu_{R}/\mu_{0}\), \(\mu_{F}/\mu_{0}\leq 2\) using 3-point envelope. No specific top quark decay mode is selected, but some selection cuts are applied to the objects: the \(p_{\rm T}\) of jets and leptons is required to be greater than 25 GeV, \(|\eta|<\)2.47 (2.4) for electrons (muons) and \(|\eta|<\)2.5 for jets.

The two MadGraph5_aMC@NLO samples predict similar jet multiplicities, while the Sherpa sample has a good agreement with them at low jet multiplicity, but it shows higher jet multiplicity in the high jet multiplicity

region. The jet momenta distributions are different between all generators. The MadGraph5_aMC@NLO sample interfaced with Herwig 7 predicts softer jets compared to Pythia 8, while Sherpa predicts harder jets compared to the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO samples. For the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 sample, the uncertainty due to different choices of factorisation and renormalisation variations is relatively small in the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions, but it is significantly larger in the jet multiplicity distributions. For the Sherpa sample, while the uncertainty associated to the scale variations is low for the jet multiplicity, it becomes larger (of the order of 20%) for the jet \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions, in particular for the \(H_{T}\) distribution. The \(b\)-jet multiplicity is in very good agreement among all the three generators up to four \(b\)-jets (the ones from the top decay), while it shows differences of up to 40% in the \(b\)-jet region produced by the parton showers. The transverse \(b\)-jet momenta seem quite similar for the three configurations.

The distributions are normalized to their corresponding cross-section. The lower ratio is calculated with respect to the MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 NLO distribution. The uncertainties shown reflect the finite sample statistics (solid lines) and the effect of the different choices of factorisation and renormalisation scales (shaded bands).

## 6 Modelling of the \(tWZ\) process

In this section, the production of a top quark in association with a \(W\) and a \(Z\) boson (\(tWZ\)) is studied with MC generators at NLO in QCD. So far, there are no experimental results for this process, but it enters as a background for various measurements and searches for new physics and is also of interest for EFT interpretations [75].

The matrix element calculation is performed with MadGraph5_aMC@NLO using the five flavour scheme with massless \(b\) quarks. The renormalisation and factorisation scales are set to 172.5 GeV, and the shower starting scale is set to \(H_{T}/2\). The top quark and the \(W\) and \(Z\) bosons produced in association with it are required to be on shell and the decays of these particles are simulated with MadSpin. The \(Z\) boson mass is set to \(m_{Z}=91.1876\,\text{GeV}\) and it is required to decay into a charged lepton pair, while both leptonic and hadronic decay modes are allowed for the \(W\) bosons (both for the \(W\) boson from the top quark decay and the one produced in association with the top quark). The parton showering and fragmentation is performed using Pythia 8.235 with the A14 tune, and the decays of bottom and charm hadrons are simulated using EvtGen v.1.6.0. The PDFs used are NNPDF3.0NLO and NNPDF2.3LO for the ME and PS respectively.

In Figure 12 a couple of example diagrams for \(tWZ\) production are shown, namely a leading order diagram and a similar diagram with an additional gluon emission. At NLO in QCD, Feynman diagrams with an additional emission of a \(b\) quark are also generated, as seen in Figure 13. Some of these diagrams contain a top quark propagator. In the case where it is kinematically allowed for the top quark propagator to be resonant, there will be overlaps with other processes that involve top quark pair production. Diagrams with a resonant top quark propagator that give rise to an on-shell \(W\) boson and \(b\) quark are circled in blue in Fig. 13. Such diagrams overlap with \(t\bar{t}Z\) production when one takes into account the subsequent \(t\to Wb\) decay of the top quarks. Diagrams with a top quark propagator that give rise to an on-shell \(W\) boson, \(Z\) boson and a \(b\) quark are circled in red. Such diagrams would overlap with \(t\bar{t}\) followed by the three-body decay of one of the top quarks \(t\to WbZ\). As the masses of the \(W\) boson, the \(Z\) boson and the \(b\) quark (the latter is massless in the simulation) add up to a couple of GeV below the top quark mass, such top quark propagators can in principle be resonant, but the phase space for such diagrams with the top quark on-shell is very limited.

As in the case of \(tW\) production at NLO, where there is a priori an overlap with \(t\bar{t}\) production, an overlap removal scheme needs to be employed to \(tWZ\) in order to avoid the double counting of Feynman diagrams with \(t\bar{t}Z\). The methods employed here are diagram removal without quantum interference, denoted DR1 [76], and diagram removal with interference, denoted DR2 [77]. The main points of the DR1 and DR2 methods are summarised in the equations below, and a more extensive account of the DR2 method is given in Ref. [77].

Figure 12: Two examples of Feynman diagrams for \(tWZ\) production are shown here: one leading order diagram (left) and one at next-to-leading order in QCD that has the additional emission of a gluon.

\[\mathcal{A}_{tot} = \mathcal{A}_{1r}+\mathcal{A}_{2r}, \tag{4}\] \[|\mathcal{A}|^{2}_{tot} = |\mathcal{A}_{1r}|^{2}+2\mathcal{A}_{1r}\mathcal{A}^{*}{}_{2r}+| \mathcal{A}_{2r}|^{2},\] (5) \[|\mathcal{A}|^{2}_{DR1} = |\mathcal{A}_{1r}|^{2}\] (6) \[|\mathcal{A}|^{2}_{DR2} = |\mathcal{A}_{1r}|^{2}+2\mathcal{A}_{1r}\mathcal{A}^{*}{}_{2r} \tag{7}\]

The Feynman amplitude for the \(tWZ\) process prior to diagram removal, \(\mathcal{A}_{tot}\), can be split into the singly resonant diagrams with only one on-shell top quark, denoted with 1r in eq.( 4) and those with an additional top quark propagator that can be on-shell, denoted with 2r for doubly resonant. The singly resonant diagrams do not overlap with other processes, while the doubly resonant diagrams do. The production cross-section is proportional to the amplitude squared (eq. 5), which includes an interference term between the singly resonant and doubly resonant parts. With diagram removal 1 (eq. 6) only the singly-resonant part is kept, while with diagram removal 2 the term representing the interference between singly and doubly resonant diagrams is also included.

The application of the diagram removal methods to the \(tWZ\) process was first described in Ref. [64]. There, both diagrams containing \(t\to Wb\) propagators and those with \(t\to WbZ\) were considered for the diagram removal procedures ("maximal removal"). Since then, the application of the methods has been revised, as suggested in Ref. [78]. Only diagrams with a top quark propagator \(t\to Wb\) (circled in blue in Figure 13) are now considered in the diagram removal procedures ("minimal removal"). The ambiguity of which diagrams to consider for diagram removal is specific to the \(tWZ\) process, because the masses of the \(W\) boson, the \(Z\) boson and the \(b\) quark are near the threshold for a top quark resonance. The change in approach has

Figure 13: At NLO in QCD, some of the Feynman diagrams for \(tWZ\) production will contain an additional \(b\) quark in the final state. Such diagrams may contain a resonant top quark propagator in addition to the required resonant top quark. Top quark propagators that give rise to \(W\)+\(b\) only are circled in blue. Top quark propagators that give rise to \(W\)+\(b\)+\(Z\) are circled in red. Diagrams of the type that have a blue circle are considered for ”minimal” diagram removal.

implications for both the DR1 and DR2 predictions, as fewer diagrams are now removed from the prediction (for DR1) or have the doubly-resonant term, contributing to the calculation of interference, removed (for DR2). On the level of the total cross-section this change has a larger effect on the DR2 prediction, which increases, resulting in a smaller difference between DR1 and DR2. With the previous "maximal removal" procedure the difference in inclusive cross-section between the DR1 and DR2 predictions was above 20%, while with the "minimal removal" procedure used throughout this document the corresponding difference is below 10%. The cross-sections multiplied by the branching ratio for \(Z\to\ell^{+}\ell^{-}\) as computed with the two methods, are given in Table 6. The difference in prediction between DR1 and DR2 can give an estimate of the (destructive) quantum interference with \(t\bar{t}Z\). The diagram removal methods are now applied to both the matrix elements that are computed by MadGraph5_aMC@NLO as well as to those that are regenerated by MadSpin to have a consistent description of the spin correlations.

Figure 14 shows the jet multiplicity and the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum of the leading jet for jets with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) for events with exactly three muons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) and no electrons fulfilling these cuts in the final state. This selection is expected to result in at least three jets, at least one of which originates from a \(b\) quark. The difference between the DR1 and DR2 predictions is visible for events with high jet multiplicity and with high \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) jets. A topology with a higher jet multiplicity is characteristic for \(t\bar{t}Z\), so a larger destructive interference is expected in this region.

The top two rows of Figure 15 show distributions for the top quark, the \(W\) boson and the \(Z\) boson from the hard scattering, generated withMadGraph5_aMC@NLO. The \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the three particles as well as the scalar sum of their transverse momenta, denoted \(\bar{H}_{T}\), is shown. The bottom left plot shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) spectrum of the \(W\) boson from decay of the above-mentioned top quark, which is simulated with MadSpin. The bottom right plot shows the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of muons, which originate from the decays of other particles (electrons show a similar spectrum). In general, the difference between DR1 and DR2 increases at higher momenta. In particular, a large difference is seen at high momenta of the \(W\) boson that is produced in association with the top quark (the middle right plot). Such a trend was also seen for the \(tW\) and \(tWH\) processes in Ref. [77].

The muons and the jets are required to have \(p_{\rm T}>\)25 GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\). The uncertainties shown reflect the finite sample statistics (solid lines) and the shaded bands represent the scale uncertainty, using the choice of scales that gives the largest total shift in the 7-point variation.

## 7 Conclusions

The modelling of five rare top processes (\(t\bar{t}W\), \(t\bar{t}Z/\gamma^{*}\), \(t\bar{t}H\), \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) and \(tWZ\)) has been studied in this note. Several MC event generators for the matrix elements (MadGraph5_aMC@NLO, Powheg and Sherpa) and different PS and hadronisation models (Pythia 8, Herwig 7 or Sherpa) have been compared for each physics process. NLO multileg configurations have been studied for \(t\bar{t}W\), \(t\bar{t}Z/\gamma^{*}\) and \(t\bar{t}H\) processes. The impact of renormalization and factorization scale variations in some selected observables is presented and discussed. These studies will allow to improve ATLAS MC simulations and potentially reduce the systematic theoretical modelling uncertainties, which are already a limiting factor in many experimental LHC results.

For \(t\bar{t}W\) production, both NLO inclusive and multileg merged (up to 1 jet at NLO and 2 jets at LO) configurations have been studied for two different MC event generators: MadGraph5_aMC@NLO interfaced to Pythia 8 and Sherpa 2.2.8. Comparing these event generators with the same accuracy, no significant differences have been observed. The largest difference is seen for the multiplicity of \(b\)-jets. This can be partially attributed to the different treatment in the decays of bottom and charm hadrons. EvtGen has not been used for the Sherpa samples. Detailed studies varying the functional form of the renormalisation (\(\mu_{R}\)) and factorisation (\(\mu_{F}\)) scales have also been performed and a strong dependence of the cross-section with the scale choice has been seen for the NLO inclusive samples. Using a multileg configuration, higher jet multiplicity and harder jets are seen with respect to the NLO inclusive one. In addition, rare electroweak production mechanisms (referred to as "tree-level \(t\bar{t}W\) EW" production) have been studied. An overall increase of 10% (5%) in the \(t\bar{t}W\) cross-section is observed for MadGraph5_aMC@NLO (Sherpa 2.2.8), being enhanced in some regions of the kinematic distributions. It is interesting to notice that the predicted cross section calculated using the lower scale combined with the EW contribution agrees better with the latest experimental measurements. Though challenging, theoretical predictions including NNLO calculations for this process are desirable.

For \(t\bar{t}Z/\gamma^{*}\) production, MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 and Sherpa 2.2.1 MC samples with NLO inclusive and multileg (up to 1 jet at NLO) accuracies have been compared. As expected, the impact of NLO multileg is seen in the jet multiplicity and jets \(p_{T}\) spectrum. Overall, the two MC event generators agree quite well.

In the case of \(t\bar{t}H\) process, three configurations with NLO inclusive accuracy using MadGraph5_aMC@NLO or Powheg interfaced to Pythia 8 or Herwig 7 are compared. In addition, a MadGraph5_aMC@NLO +Pythia 8 FxFx sample (with up 1 jet at NLO and 2 jets at LO) is also studied. The latter as well as the Powheg samples show higher jet multiplicity and harder jets than the inclusive MadGraph5_aMC@NLO one. The Higgs \(p_{T}\) distribution, being used in the recent \(t\bar{t}H\) simplified template cross-sections measurements, shows a mild dependence for these event generators.

For \(t\bar{t}t\bar{t}\) process, three NLO inclusive samples have been compared using Sherpa 2.2.8 or MadGraph5_aMC@NLO interfaced to Pythia 8 and Herwig 7. Sherpa 2.2.8 predicts an overall higher jet multiplicity and harder jet momenta. In addition, there is a significant difference on the radiation of additional \(b\)-jets between all the generators.

Finally, two different prescriptions (DR1 and DR2) to deal with the interference of \(tWZ\) process with \(t\bar{t}Z\) production at NLO have been explored. The difference in the predicted total cross sections is below 10%. The difference between the two prescriptions is visible for events with high jet multiplicity and with high \(p_{T}\) jets, which is the topology of \(t\bar{t}Z\) process.
