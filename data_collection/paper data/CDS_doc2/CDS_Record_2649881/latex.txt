## 1 Introduction

New phenomena beyond the predictions of the Standard Model (SM) may alter a \(CP\)-symmetry violation (\(CPV\)) in \(b\)-hadron decays. \(CPV\) in \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) occurs due to interference between direct decay and \(B_{s}^{0}\) mixing. The oscillation frequency of \(B_{s}^{0}\) mixing is characterized by the mass difference \(\Delta m_{s}\) of the heavy (\(B_{H}\)) and light (\(B_{L}\)) mass eigenstates. Other physical quantities involved in \(B_{s}^{0}\) mixing are the decay width \(\Gamma_{s}=(\Gamma_{L}+\Gamma_{H})/2\) and the width difference \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}=\Gamma_{L}-\Gamma_{H}\), where \(\Gamma_{L}\) and \(\Gamma_{H}\) are the decay widths of the \(B_{L}\) and \(B_{H}\) states. The \(CPV\) phase \(\phi_{s}\) is induced by the weak phase difference between the \(B_{s}^{0}\) mixing and the \(b\to c\overline{c}s\) decay amplitudes. In the SM \(\phi_{s}\) is small and can be related to CKM quark mixing matrix elements via the relation \(\phi_{s}\simeq-2\beta_{s}\), with \(\beta_{s}=arg[-(V_{ts}V_{tb}^{*})/(V_{cs}V_{cb}^{*})]\). Assuming no BSM contributions a value of \(-2\beta_{s}=-0.0370\pm 0.0006\) rad can be predicted by combining beauty and kaon physics observables, see [1]. The value of \(\phi_{s}\) is potentially expected to be sensitive to the physics phenomena Beyond SM (BSM), hence the experimental measurement of the \(CPV\) phase \(\phi_{s}\) is a viable probe of BSM effects in Heavy Flavours.

Currently all LHC \(\phi_{s}\) measurements are consistent with the SM, see Figure 1. The combined Run 1 LHC value is \(\phi_{s}=-0.021\pm 0.031\) rad, taken from [2, 3]. As reported in that publication, the most precise LHCb result is obtained from the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) channel, with some improvements deriving from the combination with additional channels. It is clear that the SM precision in predicting \(\phi_{s}\) is still much better than the current experimental reach. Some improvements are expected from Run 2 and Run 3, however the search for New Physics will flourish with the HL-LHC upgrade.

ATLAS measured in Run 1 [4] the phase \(\phi_{s}\) and the corresponding width difference \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\) as:

\[\phi_{s}=-0.090\pm 0.078\ (\text{stat})\pm 0.041\ (\text{syst}) \ \ \text{rad}\] \[\Delta\Gamma_{s}= 0.085\pm 0.011\ (\text{stat})\pm 0.007\ (\text{syst}) \ \ \text{ps}^{-1}.\]

This document presents an estimate of the precision that ATLAS could achieve on \(\phi_{s}\) using the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) decay, during HL-LHC. ATLAS is a general purpose detector with central geometry, exploiting the full

luminosity provided by the LHC to record, among others, a large amount of \(J/\psi\) decays, leading to similarly large exclusive \(B\to J/\psi X\) decay samples. In addition to the much higher number of events which will be available in comparison to the current set-up, ATLAS' impact on the \(\phi_{s}\) measurement will be significantly affected by the upgrade foreseen for its inner detector.

The document is structuted as follows: the assumptions made in the extrapolations are explained in Section 2, followed by the description of the simulation, reconstruction and the selection of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) decay candidates in Section 3 and 4, and the resulting event yields in Section 5. The performance study of the upgraded detector for the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) events in the high pile-up environment of HL-LHC is presented in Section 6. All characteristics are brought together in the Section 7 to provide an estimate of the precision for \(\phi_{s}\) achievable with HL-LHC. The method used to estimate the \(\phi_{s}\) precision is described in Section 7. Notes about the evolution of the systematics are summarized in Section 8. Finally, conclusions are given in Section 9.

## 2 Assumptions of the extrapolations

The experimental result on \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) is based on a simultaneous fit to the signal candidates time-dependent angular distribution. Without performing a complete analysis, the relative improvement in the \(\phi_{s}\) precision can be projected from several key factors: the extrapolated number of signal and background events, the B-flavour tagging performance and the \(B_{s}^{0}\) proper decay time resolution, all combined as described in Section 7.

The number of signal events and the signal fractions are estimated using real Run 2 data collected during 2015 and 2016, as described in Section 5. Three trigger scenarios are considered, all based on di-muon trigger targeting the \(J/\psi\to\mu\mu\) decay. In the most optimistic case, the individual muon trigger transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\))1 thresholds are kept at at 6, corresponding to lowest unprescaled Run 2 \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) trigger. An intermediate scenario requires in addition one of the muons to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) above 10. In the conservative case, only events with both muons of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) above 10 are collected. The three scenarios are hereafter denoted as \(\mu\)6\(\mu\)6, \(\mu\)10\(\mu\)6 and \(\mu\)10\(\mu\)10. The choice of the scenarios is based on considerations discussed in the ATLAS Phase II TDAQ TDR [5] in Section 2.10. The study here ignores possible inefficiency for close-by muons described in Section 3.2.2 of the TDAQ TDR, as this is likely to be addressed by future developments of the ATLAS upgrade triggers. In this paper, the trigger thresholds are emulated with corresponding offline-reconstruction cuts on the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the muons, since more accurate simulations of the trigger selections are not yet available. Trigger muon momentum smearing relative to offline reconstruction could introduce additional effects.

Footnote 1: ATLAS uses a right-handed coordinate system with its origin at the nominal interaction point (IP) in the centre of the detector and the \(z\)-axis along the beam pipe. The \(x\)-axis points from the IP to the centre of the LHC ring, and the \(y\)-axis points upward. Cylindrical coordinates (\(r,\Phi\)) are used in the transverse plane, \(\Phi\) being the azimuthal angle around the \(z\)-axis. The pseudorapidity is defined in terms of the polar angle \(\theta\) as \(\eta=-\ln\tan(\theta/2)\).

The knowledge of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson flavour at the time of production (or decay) dramatically increases sensitivity of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) analysis. In the current ATLAS analyses, opposite-side taggers have been developed, relying on reconstruction and flavour identification of the other \(b\) hadron in the same event. Each tagging is characterized by its efficiency and purity (see Section 7). The tagging performance at HL-LHC is assumed to be similar or better than in Run 1 data, since in the future Runs new tagging algorithms (e.g. same-side flavour taggers) are expected to be developed.

Finally, the precision on \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates proper decay time is an important ingredient to the analysis. For the HL-LHC extrapolations this is extracted from the simulation of signal events. The resulting improvement will be demonstrated in Section 6.

## 3 Simulation samples

The projected \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) performance during the HL-LHC phase is based on signal samples simulated with the upgraded ATLAS detector layout. During the HL-LHC installation (Phase-II upgrade) the ATLAS detector systems will undergo several improvements and replacements. B-physics measurements are most effected by the replacement of the tracking system by a full-silicon detectors based tracker, ITk [6]. The pixel detector layer closest to the beam pipe is expected to consist of sensing elements of size 50 \(\upmu\)m\(\times\)50 \(\upmu\)m and will have 39 mm radius.

The simulated samples include pile-up of 200 events, expected to be reached at the maximum HL-LHC instantaneous luminosity of \(7\times 10^{34}\) cm\({}^{2}\)s\({}^{-1}\). The extrapolations in this paper assume a total integrated luminosity of 3000 fb\({}^{-1}\).

ATLAS Run 1 and Run 2 MC simulations of \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) decays are used when comparing performance with the HL-LHC set-up. In Run 2, the ATLAS tracking system was upgraded by installation of an additional layer of Pixel detectors closest to the beam pipe, and significantly improving the secondary vertex resolution [7; 8]. With ITk, the resolution is expected to further improve, as described in Section 6.

## 4 Event selection

In order to be included in the analysis, reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) MC events are required to contain at least one pair of oppositely charged muon candidates, reconstructed using information from the Muon Spectrometer (MS) and the Inner Detector (ID) [9]. In this analysis the muon parameters and kinematics are taken from the ID measurement alone, as the MS does not improve the precision in the momentum regime of this analysis. The pairs of tracks associated to muons are fitted to a common vertex and accepted in the analysis if the vertex fit results in \(\chi^{2}/\mathrm{d.o.f.}<10\). The invariant mass of the muon pair is calculated from the track parameters after the vertex fit. The \(J/\psi\) candidates are required to have a reconstructed mass within a window, that was selected to retain 99.8% of the \(J/\psi\) candidates identified in the fits.

The \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\) candidates are reconstructed from all pairs of oppositely charged tracks with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>1\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\) that are not identified as muons and the invariant mass of the track pairs (using a Kaon mass hypothesis) falls within the interval \(1.0085\) GeV \(<m(K^{+}K^{-})<1.0305\) GeV. \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\) candidates result from fitting the tracks for each combination of \(J/\psi\rightarrow\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\) and \(\phi\to K^{+}K^{-}\) to a common vertex. The fit is further constrained by fixing the invariant mass calculated from the two muon tracks to the world average \(J/\psi\) mass [2]. These quadruplets of tracks are accepted for further analysis if the vertex fit has a \(\chi^{2}/\mathrm{d.o.f.}<3\) and the invariant mass of the candidate \(K^{+}K^{-}\) pair falls within the interval \(1.0085\) GeV \(<m(K^{+}K^{-})<1.0305\) GeV. \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidates used in the fit are collected within a mass range of \(5.15\) GeV \(<m(B_{s}^{0})<5.65\) GeV.

The decay time of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson is calculated as:

\[t=\frac{L_{xy}\ m_{B}}{c\ p_{\mathrm{T}}(B)} \tag{1}\]where \(p_{\rm T}(B)\) is the reconstructed transverse momentum of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson candidate and \(m_{B}\) denotes the mass of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson, taken from Ref. [2]. The transverse decay length, \(L_{xy}\), is the displacement in the transverse plane of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson decay vertex with respect to the primary vertex, projected onto the direction of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) transverse momentum. The events are simulated with the number of pile-up proton-proton interactions ranging between 190-210, corresponding to the HL-LHC conditions. The average number of reconstructed primary vertices is \(N_{\rm PV}\sim 97\). The primary vertex originating the \(B_{s}^{0}\) candidate needs to be identified. The variable used is the impact parameter \(a_{0}\), which is calculated as the distance between the line extrapolated from the reconstructed \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson vertex in the direction of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) momentum, and each reconstructed primary vertex candidate. The chosen primary vertex is the one with the smallest \(a_{0}\). The primary vertex position is then recalculated after removing any tracks used in the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson candidate to avoid biasing \(L_{xy}\). In order to ascertain if the primary vertex selection procedure degrades the resolution the proper decay time of \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson, the difference between true and the reconstructed proper decay times \(\Delta_{t}^{\rm MC-reco}=t_{\rm MC}-t_{\rm reconstructed}\) has been studied as a function of the number of reconstructed primary vertices. The RMS of the \(\Delta_{t}^{\rm MC-reco}\) values for each \(N_{\rm PV}\) value are shown in Figure 2 (left), with the corresponding mean distribution reported on the Figure 2 (right). From these distributions it has been concluded that increasing levels of pile-up do not significantly bias or degrade resolution of the measurement of the proper time.

## 5 Event yields

The number of signal (\(N_{\rm sig}\)) and background events are extrapolated from real ATLAS data. In order to use as close as possible data taking conditions, the extrapolations are performed from preliminary Run 2 data: 36.2 fb\({}^{-1}\) collected during 2015 and 2016 \(pp\) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV, from Ref. [8]. The relative trigger efficiency in the trigger scenarios is determined from HL-LHC simulations. The level of background events is estimated from the Run 2 data signal fraction in events passing the three trigger conditions. The increase of \(b\bar{b}\) production cross-section from 13 TeV to 14 TeV centre of mass energy is neglected. Similarly, to be conservative, the offline reconstruction efficiency of the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})\phi(K^{+}K^{-})\) decay is assumed to be the same as in Run 2.

Run 1 (ID), Run 2 (IBL) and upgrade HL-LHC MC simulations are included for a comparison. All these samples use 6 GeV muon \(p_{\rm T}\) cuts.

The resulting number of expected signal events \(N_{\rm sig}\) and the signal fractions \(f_{\rm sig}\) are shown in the Table 1 together with the results obtained in Section 7.

## 6 ATLAS Upgrade performance

The precision of the \(CPV\) phase \(\phi_{s}\) strongly depends on the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson proper decay time uncertainty. The upgraded ATLAS tracking system is expected to improve tracking and vertexing precision, as documented in the Pixel TDR [6]. These improvements are propagated to the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson reconstruction, using the dedicated HL-LHC \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) signal MC samples. The proper decay time resolution2 as a function of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson transverse momentum is extracted from HL-LHC simulations and compared in Figure 3 (left) with the Run 1 and Run 2 simulated detector performances. The ITk is expected to improve the proper decay time resolution by 21% and 39%, compared to Run 2 and Run 1 ATLAS tracking systems (with and without IBL). Stability of the resolution in the HL-LHC pile-up conditions (\(\langle\mu\rangle=200\)) is demonstrated in the Figure 2 (left), showing the resolution as a function of the number of reconstructed primary vertices. The results shown in Figure 3 update previous studies from Ref. [6] with updated simulations of the detector geometry and more realistic material descriptions.

Footnote 2: The ATLAS \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) analyses use per-candidate reconstructed proper decay time resolutions, where uncertainties on the track parameters are propagated to the proper decay time calculation. The presented proper decay time resolution is thus defined as the RMS of the multi-Gaussian distribution constructed from Gaussians with \(\sigma\) equal to the per-candidate errors. Since the errors on the track parameters do not fully describe the real track resolution, the per-candidate errors are further corrected by a global scale-factor \(S_{t}\). \(S_{t}\) is extracted from the comparison of the per-candidate resolution and the MC-truth based resolution.

With the ITk is also expected to improve the \(B_{s}^{0}\) invariant mass resolution by 30%. The effect of this improvement on the \(\phi_{s}\) precision is not trivial and is neglected in this paper.

Figure 3: Dependence of the proper decay time resolution of the \(B_{s}^{0}\) meson of the signal \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) decay on \(B_{s}^{0}\)\(p_{\rm T}\). Per-candidate resolutions corrected for scale-factors are shown, comparing the performance in Run 1 (ID), Run 2 (IBL) and upgrade HL-LHC MC simulations. All samples use 6 \(\mathrm{Ge\kern-1.0ptV}\) muon \(p_{\rm T}\) cuts.

## 7 Extraction of \(\phi_{s}\) and \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\) precision method and results

The main parameters driving the \(\phi_{s}\) precision can be extracted from the events simulated and reconstructed in the HL-LHC ATLAS set-up as described in Ref. [6]. Following the estimation procedure detailed in [10], the expected precision on \(\phi_{s}\) can be estimated from the \(B_{s}^{0}\to J/\psi\phi\) probability density function in the space of decay angles and time [4]. The estimate presented here integrates over the angular variables and assumes the world average value \(\phi_{s}=-0.021\pm 0.031\) rad [3], approximating \(\cos(\phi_{s})=1\) and \(\sin(\phi_{s})=\phi_{s}\). Assuming also \(\Gamma_{H}\approx\Gamma_{L}\approx\Gamma_{s}\), the following relationships hold:

\[\delta_{\phi_{s}}^{\rm stat}\sim\left[\sqrt{TP}\cdot D_{\rm bck}\cdot D_{\rm time }\cdot\sqrt{N_{\rm sig}}\right]^{-1} \tag{2}\]

\[TP =\epsilon\cdot(1-2W)^{2} \tag{3}\] \[D_{\rm bck} =\frac{N_{\rm sig}}{N_{\rm sig}+N_{\rm bck}}=f_{\rm sig}\] (4) \[D_{\rm time} =\exp\big{[}-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{t}\Delta m_{s})^{2}\big{]} \tag{5}\]

where \(TP\) and \(D_{\rm bck}\) account for the flavour tagging power and the signal purity, respectively. \(\epsilon\) denotes the tagging efficiency, \(W\) the wrong tag fraction, \(N_{\rm sig}\) and \(N_{\rm bck}\) the numbers of signal and background events and \(f_{\rm sig}\) the signal fraction. The factor \(D_{\rm time}\) accounts for dilution effects due to proper time resolution as a convolution of the time dependent part of the decay amplitude: \(\exp(-\Gamma_{s}\tau)\cdot\sin(\Delta m_{s}\tau)\) with a Gaussian function of width \(\sigma_{t}\) (the proper decay time measurement resolution); \(\Delta m_{s}=17.757\pm 0.021\) ps\({}^{-1}\) is the mass difference between the heavy and light \(B_{s}^{0}\) mass states.

The predicted \(\delta_{\phi_{s}}^{\rm stat}\) values are calculated relative to the value measured using 2012 data, published in [4].

\[\delta_{\phi_{s}}^{\rm stat}=\delta_{\phi_{s}}^{\rm stat}(12)\cdot\frac{\sqrt{ TP(12)}\cdot f_{\rm sig}(12)\cdot\exp\big{[}-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{t}(12) \Delta m_{s})^{2}\big{]}\cdot\sqrt{N_{\rm sig}(12)}}{\sqrt{TP}\cdot f_{\rm sig }\cdot\exp\big{[}-\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_{t}\Delta m_{s})^{2}\big{]}\cdot\sqrt{N_ {\rm sig}}} \tag{6}\]

While \(f_{\rm sig}\) has been verified to not depend appreciably on pile-up, it is in principle dependent on the centre of mass energy (since this affects the particles multiplicity per hard scatter and hence e.g. the primary vertex detection efficiency and accuracy). However this extrapolation is small when going from 13 TeV to 14 TeV and it is neglected. The prediction method has been validated using 2011 data, for which the predicted \(\delta_{\phi_{s}}^{\rm stat}\) (see Table 1), is consistent with the measurement, published in [11]. HL-LHC extrapolations are reported in Table 1 for the three different trigger muon thresholds: 6 GeV-6 GeV, 6 GeV-10 GeV and 10 GeV-10 GeV. Table 1 includes also the predicted precision on the measurement of \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\), which scales proportionally to \((\sqrt{N_{\rm sig}})^{-1}\).

Since the performance of the flavour tagging methods is highly dependent on the environment, which can not yet be precisely extracted from current upgrade simulation and reconstruction tools (and must be typically calibrated on the data itself), and also the potential for development of further tagging algorithms, such as same-side tagging (not included in Run-1 measurements), the precision on \(\phi_{s}\), \(\delta_{\phi_{s}}^{\rm stat}\), is presented in the Figure 4 for a broad range of \(TP\) values for each of the trigger threshold scenarios considered. The lower \(TP\) bound is given conservatively by muon tagger only performance in the HL-LHC simulation. The upper bound considers the potential increased \(TP\) in comparison to Run 1 value due to inclusion of same-side tagging methods, which have not been included in Run 1. For the results in Table 1, and the contours of Figure 4, the nominal value of the \(TP\), taken from Run 1, is assumed.

## 8 Systematic uncertainties

All the significant sources of systematic uncertainties considered in the Run 1 result can be potentially improved with the higher statistics of data collected at the HL-LHC:

* Fit model systematic uncertainties rely on the constraints of the background PDF coming from the signal sidebands in data and hence will be better constrained as signal statistics increases.
* The uncertainty due to flavour tagging is similarly data-driven, since the flavour tagger is calibrated on \(B^{\pm}\) candidates in data.
* Detector acceptance uncertainty is determined by MC statistics as well as data-MC comparison, which will improve with larger data and MC samples.

\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c c c} \hline \hline Period & \(L_{\text{int}}\) [fb\({}^{-1}\)] & \(N_{\text{sig}}\) & \(f_{\text{sig}}\) & Tag Power [\%] & \(\sigma(\tau)\) [ps] & \(\delta^{\text{stat}}_{\phi_{s}}\) [rad] & \(\delta^{\text{stat}}_{\Delta\Gamma_{s}}\) [ps\({}^{-1}\)] \\  & & & & & & measured & measured \\  & & & & & & (extrapolated) & (extrapolated) \\ \hline

\end{table}

* Detector alignment systematic uncertainties are determined from data-driven alignment techniques, thus possible improving with larger calibration samples and improved techniques.
* Systematic uncertainties due to peaking backgrounds (e.g. \(B^{0}_{d}\) and \(\Lambda_{b}\) decays) are driven by these modes' branching ratio uncertainties and are thus expected to improve with HL-LHC data collected by ATLAS and other experiments.

A realistic estimate of the overall systematics uncertainty can be thus made by scaling most of the systematics from the measurement at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV with the inverse square root of the ratio of the integrated luminosities. The MC-statistics dependent systematic uncertainties are assumed to be negligible. In a conservative approach, the detector alignment systematic uncertainties are kept at the value of the Run 1 analysis, yielding \(\delta^{\rm syst}_{\phi_{s}}\approx 0.006\) rad and \(\delta^{\rm syst}_{\Delta\Gamma_{s}}\approx 0.0005\) ps\({}^{-1}\). However, a preliminary method [12] of correcting for radial bias in the alignment has been developed for Run 2 and has the potential to reduce the detector alignment systematic by factor of \(\sim 4\times\). Considering this improvement the total systematic errors yields \(\delta^{\rm syst}_{\phi_{s}}\approx 0.003\) rad and \(\delta^{\rm syst}_{\Delta\Gamma_{s}}\approx 0.0005\) ps\({}^{-1}\). The \(B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\phi\) analysis is thus expected to be limited mainly by the statistical precision.

Figure 5 shows the extrapolated ATLAS precision (combining statistical and systematic uncertainties) overlaid with the present precision on \(\phi_{s}\) and \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\). Since the correlation between \(\phi_{s}\) and \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\) in ATLAS Run 1 result has found to be smaller than 10%, the extrapolated contours of ATLAS HL-LHC are made with zero correlation.

## 9 Conclusions

The precision of the measurement of the \(CP\)-violating phase \(\phi_{s}\) in the \(B^{0}_{s}\to J/\psi\phi\) decay at the upgraded ATLAS detector at High-Luminosity LHC is presented. The projections account for the most relevant improvements to the detector performance, particularly in relation to the \(B^{0}_{s}\) meson proper decay time resolution. The size of the signal sample will strongly depend on the trigger thresholds. Three trigger scenarios are considered, providing optimistic (Run-2 like), intermediate and conservative estimates. The High-Luminosity LHC statistical precision on \(\phi_{s}\) is expected to improve relative to the ATLAS Run 1

result by a factor ranging between 9\(\times\) to 20\(\times\) depending on the trigger scenario. Similarly, the improvement in the statistical precision on \(\Delta\Gamma_{s}\) is ranging between 4\(\times\) to 10\(\times\). The measurement remains dominated by the statistical precision. In the most optimistic trigger scenario, the total uncertainty on \(\phi_{s}\) will be 8\(\times\) larger than the current theoretical uncertainty and 7\(\times\) smaller than the predicted \(\phi_{s}\) value from the Standard Model.
