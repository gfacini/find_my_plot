###### Abstract

We have studied the possible decay channels in which the fourth family quarks will be observed in ATLAS detector. We have also discussed the topological event properties which can be used to identify the signals of the heavy fourth generation up and down quarks in the experiment.

[MISSING_PAGE_EMPTY:2]

In this study, we have considered two sets of mass values : \(M_{u_{4}}\approx M_{d_{4}}=320\) GeV and \(M_{u_{4}}\approx M_{d_{4}}=640\) GeV. Table 1 lists the two body and three body decay widths of \(d_{4}\) quark for these masses, where \(\mid V_{d_{4}u_{4}}\mid\approx 1\) and \(\Delta M=1\) GeV. The matrix element \(\mid V_{d_{4}t}\mid\) is taken to be 0.0057 or 0.0017 for \(M_{d_{4}}=320\) GeV, 640 GeV respectively [3, 4]. Hence, we can state that the total decay width of the fourth family down quark will be dominated by the two body decay mode.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c||c|} \hline  & & \\  & \(\Gamma(d_{4}\to t\ W)\) & \(\Gamma(d_{4}\to u_{4}\ l\nu)\) \\ \hline \(M_{d_{4}}\) & & \(\Delta M=1\) GeV \\ \hline
320 GeV & \(1.22\times 10^{-5}\) GeV & \(2.90\times 10^{-13}\) GeV \\ \hline
640 GeV & \(2.12\times 10^{-5}\) GeV & \(2.92\times 10^{-13}\) GeV \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Event generation and selection cuts

The results presented here for the pair-production of the fourth family quarks are based on the LHC (\(\sqrt{s}=14\) TeV) integrated luminosity being \(\int Ldt=10^{5}\ pb^{-1}\). The \(pp\) collisions at LHC are simulated using the PYTHIA [5] event generation package integrated with ATLFAST [6], fast detector simulation software for the ATLAS detector. In ATLFAST the following tasks are performed:

* jet reconstruction in the hadronic and electromagnetic calorimeters,
* selection of isolated leptons and photons,
* missing transverse momentum reconstruction,
* parametrization of the detector response.

The jet reconstruction is based on depositing the energy of undecayed particles into idealized segmented calorimeter which covers the full azimutal angle around the beam axis and pseudorapidity interval \(|\eta|\leq 5\). The cells of size \(\Delta\eta\) x \(\Delta\phi=0.1\) x 0.1 and \(\Delta\eta\) x \(\Delta\phi=0.2\) x 0.2 are chosen for barrel ( \(|\eta|\leq 2.5\) ) and forward regions (\(3\leq|\eta|\leq 5\)) respectively. Particle energies are smeared with energy resolution of the calorimeter, namely \(\sigma_{h}=(0.5\) x \(\sqrt{E})\)\(\oplus\) 0.03 GeV for hadrons and \(\sigma_{e/\gamma}=(0.1\) x \(\sqrt{E})\)\(\oplus\) 0.03 GeV for electrons and photons. In each cell, the particle energies are summed. Starting from highest transverse energy \(E_{t}\), the transverse energy of nearest cells within a cone of size \(\Delta R=\sqrt{\Delta\eta^{2}+\Delta\phi^{2}}\leq 0.4\) are added. If this sum is greater than a threshold of 15 GeV then all particles within this cone are identified as forming a jet. The reconstructed b-jets are accepted if they satisfy the following cuts:

* b-jet pseudorapidity \(|\eta_{b_{jet}}|\leq\) 2.5,
* transverse momentum of b-quark after final state radiation \(p_{t}\geq\) 5 GeV,
* distance between b-quark and b-jet axis \(\Delta R\leq\) 0.2.

For the ATLAS detector, the expected b-tagging efficiency is about 60%. In addition, c-quark jets will be mistagged as b-jets with probability of about 10% and mistagging of light-quark jets as b-jets is about 1%. We randomly tagged all jets accordingly. Events with an isolated lepton are selected using the cuts:

* maximum transverse energy deposition in cells in a cone \(\Delta R\leq\) 0.2 around the lepton of \(E_{T}\leq 10\) GeV,
* distance from any jet \(\Delta R\geq\) 0.4,
* transverse momentum of lepton \(p_{t}\geq\) 5 GeV,
* pseudorapidity of lepton \(|\eta_{lepton}|\leq\) 2.5,
* missing transverse momentum \(p_{t}\geq 20\) GeV.

Fourth family up quarks

### Single lepton decay channel

The observability of the signal

\[pp\to u_{4}\,\overline{u}_{4}\to b\overline{b}\ W^{+}W^{-} \tag{2}\]

with one \(W\) decaying leptonically and the related background processes

\[pp \rightarrow t\overline{t}\to l\nu+2b_{jet}+2j \tag{3}\] \[pp \rightarrow W^{\pm}+4j\to l\nu+4j\] (4) \[pp \rightarrow WW+2j\] (5) \[pp \rightarrow ZZ+2j \tag{6}\]

were studied in an earlier analysis [7]. In the final state \(u_{4}\,\overline{u}_{4}\to l^{\pm}+2j+2b_{jet}+p_{t}\), the lepton originating from W-boson decay will be clearly separated from any jet. Hence isolated lepton trigger will yield a high rejection efficiency for background processes. In addition to the selection cuts, to reduce the background, we have required \(p_{t}\geq 250\) GeV for b-jets, \(p_{t}\geq 50\) GeV for leptons. The number of jets was also restricted to two b-jets plus two light quark jets.

A dijet mass cut \(M_{jj}=M_{W}\,\pm\,25\) GeV was used to enhance the \(u_{4}\) quark signal relative to background. Figure 2a) and 2b) show the reconstructed invariant mass distributions of \(jjb\) system for background and signal processes. In both figures a clear excess around the \(u_{4}\) quark mass is observed and the statistical significance of the signal above background is quite large. In Table 2, the signal to background ratios (\(\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}\)) are presented for \(u_{4}\) quark masses 320 and 640 GeV together with the contributions from different backgrounds corresponding to one year of high luminosity. In the last column, we present the results for \(M_{u_{4}}=780\) GeV which we quote as the discovery limit corresponding to \(\frac{S}{\sqrt{B}}\,=5\).

### All-jets decay channel

When a pair of \(u_{4}\,\overline{u}_{4}\) is produced in (2), approximately 45% of the final states will be observed as events where both \(W\)'s decay hadronically:

\[u_{4}\,\overline{u}_{4}\,\to 2b_{jets}+4j\qquad. \tag{7}\]

In order to study this decay mode, events having six or more reconstructed jets and no isolated leptons were selected. We have applied a correction to recalibrate the transverse moment a of jets [6]. After implementing the b-tagging efficiency and the accepted mistagging percentages for the ATLAS detector, minimum two b-jets, both for the signal and background processes, were required. Table 3 summarizes the large samples of signal and background events generated, before and after applying the selection cuts described above.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline Process & Events Generated & Final Sample \\ \hline \(u_{4}\,\overline{u}_{4}\,\to 2b_{jet}+4j\) & \(2.0\times\,10^{6}\) & \(6.8\times 10^{5}\) \\ \hline \(W+nj\,ets\) & \(10^{8}\) & \(10^{4}\) \\ \hline \(QCD\,mu\,l\,ij\,ets\) & \(2.0\times\,10^{8}\) & \(3.9\times 10^{4}\) \\ \hline \(t\overline{t}\,\to 2b_{jet}+4j\) & \(10^{7}\) & \(1.4\times 10^{6}\) \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 3: Simulation statistics.

The QCD multijet events generated in parton - parton collisions are the major source of background for this process. The estimated total cross section for QCD multijets at the LHC is about 5.5 \(\mu b\). The application of event selection cuts significantly decreases the contribution of \(QCD\,multijets\) and \(W+njets\).

In Figure 3 above, the di-jet invariant mass distributions for all possible hadronic jet pairs, for signal and backgrounds are plotted. When two light quark jets satisfy the constraint \(|M_{jj}-M_{W}|<15\) GeV, the invariant mass of three jet system \(M_{jjb}\) is formed with all b-tagged jets. Figure 4 shows these distributions of \(jjb\) systems for all processes.

\end{table}

Figure 5: \(H_{t}\) distributions for different processes.

To enhance the signal of the heavy quarks in all-jets decay mode, a kinematical variable \(H_{t}\), describing the sum of the transverse energies of jets, is considered. \(H_{t}\) is defined as:

\[H_{t}=\sum_{j}\,(E_{t})_{j}\qquad, \tag{8}\]

where \((E_{t})_{j}\) is the transverse energy of the \(j^{th}\) jet in the event. The \(H_{t}\) distributions given in Figure 5 are clearly different for signal and backgrounds. Therefore a cut on this variable will be efficient in rejecting most of the background and increasing the \(S/B\) ratio. Figure 6 shows the reconstructed invariant mass distributions of the \(jjb\) system for events passing the cut \(H_{t}>500\) GeV. It is observed that the cut on \(H_{t}\) futher decrease the major background due to QCD multijets and improve the \(S/B\) ratio by about a factor 3.

The number of events surviving the \(H_{t}>500\) GeV cut for one year of data taking at high luminosity are tabulated in the Table 5 below. The quoted 5 \(\sigma\) significance for \(M_{u_{4}}=640\) GeV may change due to the statistical uncertainty of the QCD background.

Fourth family down quarks

The studies of a fourth generation down-type quark with charge \(-1/3\) have been reported by different authors [8]-[11] at SSC and CLIC. They have considered the most promising event signatures for extracting the signal of this heavy quark from the background.

We have analyzed the pair production of the fourth family down quarks at LHC through the single lepton decay channel

\[pp\to d_{4}\,\overline{d}_{4}\to t\ \overline{t}\ W^{+}W^{-}\to W^{+}b\ W^{-}\overline{b}\ W^{+}W^{-} \tag{9}\]

where one \(W\) decays leptonically and the others decay hadronically. A single lepton with a high \(p_{t}\) together with missing transverse momentum due to the undetected neutrino will give a clean trigger for these events. The topology of the final state for this process implies the successful reconstruction of \(W\) and \(t\) quark masses. The major background for this signal process is \(t\overline{t}\) pair production with additional jets from initial and final state radiations

\[pp\to t\overline{t}\to W^{+}\,W^{-}\ b\ \overline{b}+jets\qquad. \tag{10}\]

The other backgrounds such as \(WW+jets\) and \(W+jets\) do not contribute significantly.

We have generated \(9.3\cdot 10^{7}\,t\overline{t}\) events, \(5\cdot 10^{5}\) signal events for \(M_{d_{4}}=640\) GeV and \(1.2\cdot 10^{6}\) signal events for \(M_{d_{4}}=320\) GeV. The following selection criteria have been applied both to signal and background events:

* Total number of jets (including the two b-tagged jets ) = 8,
* Number of leptons with transverse momentum \(p_{t_{\rm l}}>5\) GeV = 1,
* Missing transverse momentum \(p\!\!\!/_{t}\)\(>20\) GeV,
* Transverse momenta of light jets \(p_{t}>15\) GeV.

Due to jet energy miscalibration, one needs to introduce a calibration factor \(k_{jet}=(p_{t})_{\texttt{parton}}/(p_{t})_{jet}\) as a function of \(p_{t}\) of jets [6]. We have parametrized this factor as

\[1.0922\;+\;2.4356\cdot e^{-0.066\,163\cdot(p_{t})_{jet}} \tag{11}\]

for b-jets and

\[1.0510\;+\;1.3806\cdot e^{-0.067389\cdot(p_{t})_{jet}} \tag{12}\]

for light quark jets and corrected all transverse momenta using these empirical functions. Mistagging percentages and b-tagging efficiency were applied afterwards.

To reconstruct the \(W\) bosons masses, all possible dijet pairs were considered. The distribution of their invariant mass \(M_{jj}\) is shown in Figure 7 for background and signal processes. A peak from the signal \(W\to jj\) is clearly visible at \(M_{jj}=M_{W}\) for both processes but the peak in dijet mass distribution for \(t\overline{t}\) production is broader than the same for \(d_{4}\vec{d}_{4}\) signal events. Only \(jj\) combinations with \(M_{jj}=M_{W}\pm 15\) GeV are retained for further analysis.

Figure 7: The invariant mass distribution of dijets for \(M_{d_{4}}=640\) GeV

For each \(W\to jj\), invariant masses of all possible \(jjb\) combinations are formed and plotted in Figure 8. The peak of the distribution is centered near \(M_{t}=175\) GeV. Only \(jjb\) combinations having invariant mass values constrained by \(|M_{jjb}-M_{t}|<15\) GeV were used in calculating the mass of \(d_{4}\) quark.

Figure 9 exhibits the invariant mass distribution of four light quark jets with a b-jet for all possible combinations. A clean signal for the hadronic decay \(d_{4}\to W\ t\to jjjjb\) is seen near the mass \(M_{d_{4}}\approx 640\) GeV. Estimated rates for signal and background events at LHC with integrated luminosity \(10^{5}\ pb^{-1}\) are given in Table 6. The statistical significance \(S/\sqrt{B}\) of the signal is also indicated.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|} \hline \(M_{d_{4}}\) & S & B & \(S/\sqrt{B}\) \\ \hline \hline
64 0 GeV & 3065 & 3781 & \(\approx\) 50 \\ \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

On the other hand, if the fourth family down quark mass is 320 GeV, the signal will not be as distinguishable from background as in the case of 640 GeV. For comparison, we present the dijet invariant mass distributions for \(t\overline{t}\) and \(d_{4}\,\overline{d}_{4}\) productions at \(M_{d_{4}}=320\) GeV in Figure 10. The \(M_{jjb}\) distributions shown in Figure 11 and the invariant mass distributions for the \(4\,jb\) system plotted in Figure 12 are also very similar for the signal and the background.

Figure 11: The invariant mass distribution of \(jjb\) for \(M_{d_{i}}=320\) GeV

Figure 10: The invariant mass distribution of dijets for \(M_{d_{i}}=320\) GeV

We would like to point out that the indication for the presence of the signal with \(M_{d_{4}}\) = 320 GeV, will be the absolute cross-section of events with 8 jets which is expected to be doubly enchanced by \(d_{4}\) quarks with respect to \(t\overline{t}\) production. In future, we plan to study other possibilities to enhance the signal at 320 GeV.

Conclusions

If the Standard Model fourth family quarks with the predicted masses in the range of 300 - 700 GeV exist, they will clearly manifest themselves at the LHC. We conclude that, it will be possible to observe the signal from \(u_{4}\) and \(d_{4}\) quarks up to masses of 700 GeV.
