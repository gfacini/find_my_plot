## 1 Introduction

Measurements of top-quark properties play an important role in testing the Standard Model (SM) and its possible extensions. Studies of the production and kinematic properties of a top-quark pair (\(t\bar{t}\)) in association with a photon (\(t\bar{t}\gamma\)) probe the \(t\gamma\) electroweak coupling. For instance, deviations in the transverse momentum (\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)) spectrum of the photon from the SM prediction could point to new physics through anomalous dipole moments of the top quark [1; 2; 3]. A precision measurement of the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) production cross-section could effectively constrain some of the Wilson coefficients in top-quark effective field theories [4]. Furthermore, differential distributions of photon production in \(t\bar{t}\) events can provide insight on the \(t\bar{t}\) production mechanism, in particular about the \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation and the production charge asymmetry [5].

Evidence for the production of \(t\bar{t}\) in association with an energetic, isolated photon was found in proton-antiproton (\(p\bar{p}\)) collisions at the Tevatron collider at a centre-of-mass energy of \(\sqrt{s}=1.96\) TeV by the CDF Collaboration [6]. Observation of the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) process was reported by the ATLAS Collaboration in proton-proton (\(pp\)) collisions at \(\sqrt{s}=7\) TeV [7]. Both the ATLAS and CMS Collaborations measured the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) cross-section at \(\sqrt{s}=8\) TeV [8; 9]. In the ATLAS measurement, the differential cross-sections with respect to the transverse momentum \(p_{T}\) and absolute pseudorapidity \(|\eta|\) of the photon were reported. In the CMS measurement, the ratio of the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) fiducial cross-section to the \(t\bar{t}\) total cross-section was measured. The ATLAS Collaboration also measured the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) cross-section at \(\sqrt{s}=13\) TeV [10].

The study in this note is performed using the same framework and strategy as in the 13 TeV ATLAS measurement. This note investigates the precision of the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) measurement that can be achieved at the High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) [11], using simulated data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV, which is expected to be collected by the upgraded ATLAS detector during the full run of the HL-LHC. To cope with the harsh environment at the HL-LHC, the current ATLAS detector will be upgraded significantly [12; 13]: e.g. the inner tracker is being completely rebuilt and the TRT is removed in favor of an all-new all-silicon tracker.

The study is performed in final states with one or two leptons (electron or muon). The photon can originate not only from a top quark, but also from its charged decay products, including a charged fermion (quark or lepton) from the decay of the \(W\)-boson. In addition, it can be radiated from a charged incoming parton. In the study, no attempt is made to separate these different sources of photons, but an event selection is applied to suppress those radiated from top-quark decay products. The expected uncertainties are studied for the measurements of the fiducial cross-section and differential cross-sections, normalised to unity, for several typical observables.

## 2 Simulated event samples

Particle-level samples are generated at a centre-of-mass energy of 14 TeV without detector simulation. Leptons, photons, jets and missing transverse energy in the samples are smeared [14] to simulate the effect of object reconstruction and identification efficiencies as well as their momentum or energy resolutions in the upgraded ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC. Comparing with the current ATLAS detector, improvements are expected for the upgraded ATLAS detector: e.g. stronger fake electron suppression can be achieved for the same electron identification efficiency and the muon momentum resolution will be significantlyimproved. In the smearing, a pile-up condition corresponding to an average interaction per bunch-crossing of 200 is used.

The \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) signal sample is simulated as a \(2\to 7\) process for the semileptonic and dileptonic decay channels of the \(t\bar{t}\) system at leading order (LO) by MadGraph5_aMC@NLO v2.33 [15] (denoted as MG5_aMC in the following) interfaced with Pythia v8.212 [16], using the A14 tune [17] and the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set [18]. The photon can be radiated from an initial charged parton, an intermediate top quark, or any of the charged final state particles. The top-quark mass, top-quark decay width, \(W\)-boson decay width, and fine structure constant are set to 172.5 GeV, 1.320 GeV, 2.085 GeV, and 1/137, respectively. The five-flavour scheme is used where all the quark masses are set to zero, except for the top quark. Renormalisation and factorisation scales are set dynamically, corresponding to half the sum of transverse energies over all the particles generated from the matrix element, where the transverse energy of a particle of mass \(m\) is defined as \(E_{T}=\sqrt{m^{2}+p_{\mathrm{T}}^{2}}\). The photon is requested to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>15\) GeV and \(|\eta|<5\). At least one lepton with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>15\) GeV is required, with all the leptons satisfying \(|\eta|<5\). The \(\Delta R^{1}\) between the photon and any of the charged particles among the seven final-state particles must be greater than 0.2. The resulting total cross-section of the process defined in this way is calculated to be 5.43 pb. Next-to-leading order (NLO) \(k\)-factors used in the 13 TeV \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) measurement are applied to correct the fiducial cross-sections and acceptances to NLO.

The \(t\bar{t}\) sample [19], where at least one of the top quarks decays leptonically, is generated with PowhegBox v2 [20] using the NNPDF3.0NLO PDF set [21], and interfaced with Pythia v8.210 using the A14 tune and the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set. The \(h_{\mathrm{damp}}\) parameter, which controls the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the first additional emission beyond Born level in Powheg-Box, is set to 1.5 times the top-quark mass. The \(t\bar{t}\) sample is normalised to the next-to-next-to-leading-order cross-section plus next-to-next-to-leading-logarithm corrections (NNLO+NNLL) [22], where the NNLL corrections correspond to resummation of soft gluon contributions. The \(tW\) sample [19] is produced with Powheg-Box v1 using the CT10NLO PDF set [23], interfaced with Pythia v6.428 using the Perugia 2012 tune [24] and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set [18]. The \(t\)-channel single top sample is produced with Powheg-Box using the NNPDF2.3NLO PDF set, interfaced with Pythia v8.210 using the A14 tune and the NNPDF3.3LO PDF set. The production of \(W\)+jets is simulated with MG5_aMC v2.3.2 using the NNPDF3.0NLO PDF set, interfaced with Pythia v8.210 using the A14 tune and the NNPDF2.3LO PDF set. The production of \(Z\)+jets is simulated with Powheg-Box, interfaced with Pythia v8.210 using the AZNLO tune [25] and the CTEQ6L1 PDF set. The diboson (\(WW\), \(WZ\) and \(ZZ\)) samples [26; 27] are generated using Sherpa v2.2, using the NNPDF3.0NNLO PDF set. Different parton multiplicities are used for different production mechanisms of the diboson samples and with different precisions. For all these samples, the photon radiation is handled by the corresponding parton shower. The EvtGen program [28] is used to simulate the decay of bottom and charm hadrons, except for the Sherpa samples. A summary of all the simulation samples generated for this study is given in Table 1. In the table, the cross-sections of each simulation sample are given, for some of which higher order \(k\)-factors are applied on top of the cross-sections predicted by the generators.

The \(t\bar{t}\) sample also contains \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) events as the parton shower will add photon radiation to the \(t\bar{t}\) events. To avoid the overlap between the \(t\bar{t}\) and the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) samples, events in the \(t\bar{t}\) sample are removed if they have a photon passing the prompt photon selection as defined in Section 3.

The fake lepton background contribution is estimated from the data-driven background estimate in the 13 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) analysis, scaled up by a factor of 83, the ratio of integrated luminosities between the 13 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) (36 \(\mathrm{fb}^{-1}\)) and the HL-LHC data samples. The extrapolation does not take into account the increase of the cross-section of the underlying physical processes which contribute to the fake-lepton background, due to the increase in centre-of-mass energy from 13 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) to 14 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\). However, the conservative systematics assigned to this background in Section 8 cover the possible difference. Moreover, this background is only a small background to the single-lepton channel.

The size of the simulated \(Z\gamma\) sample (which is taken from the \(Z\)+jets sample by requiring the presence of a prompt photon) is insufficient to determine the background in the dilepton channel after the full event selection. As this background is expected to be dominant in the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels, the estimate from the 13 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) analysis is extrapolated to HL-LHC by scaling it up by a factor of 83, multiplied by a further factor of 1.08 to account for the increase in \(Z\gamma\) cross section from 13 to 14 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\). The 13 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) estimate is based on a \(Z\gamma\) MC sample, which is simulated with Sherpa v2.2.2. The possible change in shape of the distributions of the observables to be unfolded, when increasing the centre-of-mass energy from 13 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) to 14 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\), is checked using the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) samples and found to be negligible.

Due to the increased pile-up activity at the HL-LHC, more stringent isolation criteria are necessary to suppress jets being misidentified as photons and consequently the combined photon reconstruction and identification efficiency is expected to be smaller than in the 13 \(\mathrm{\TeV}\) analysis by around 30% for low-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) photons, while they are similar for high-\(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) photons [14]. This difference is taken into account in the extrapolation.

## 3 Object selection

Object and event selection closely follow Ref. [10].

Electron candidates are required to have a smeared \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\)\(\mathrm{\GeV}\) and an absolute pseudorapidity \(|\eta|<2.47\), excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcap (\(|\eta|\notin[1.37,1.52]\)). The parametrised "Medium" identification criteria is applied. Muon candidates are required to have a smeared \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\)\(\mathrm{\GeV}\) and \(|\eta|<2.5\). The parametrised "Tight" identification criteria is applied. In order to apply the parameterisations, the leptons are required not to come from hadron decay. The potential increase in event yield by taking advantage of the improved \(|\eta|\) acceptance of the upgraded ATLAS detector was studied, by accepting identified electrons and muons out to \(|\eta|<4\). This leads to a percent level gain in the signal yield, which is however accompanied by a similar increase in background.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c} \hline \hline Sample & Cross-section & Generator & Parton shower & \(k\)-factor \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) & 5.43 pb (LO) & MG5\_aMC & Pythia8 & NLO, 1.30 (1.44) \\ \hline \(t\bar{t}\) & 470 pb (NLO) & POWHEG & Pythia8 & NNLO+NNLL, 1.14 \\ \hline \(tW\) & 80.5 pb (NLO) & POWHEG & Pythia6 & - \\ \hline \(t\)-channel single top & 67.5 pb (NLO) & POWHEG & Pythia8 & - \\ \hline \(W\)+jets & 65200 pb (LO) & MC5\_aMC & Pythia8 & - \\ \hline \(Z\)+jets & 4120 pb (NLO) & POWHEG & Pythia8 & - \\ \hline \(WW/WZ/ZZ\) & 363 pb & Sherpa & - \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 1: Summary of the simulation samples generated for this study. The \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) sample has different \(k\)-factors applied to the single-lepton (1.30) and dilepton (1.44) fiducial regions.

Photon candidates must have a smeared \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta_{\mathrm{cluster}}|<2.37\), excluding the transition region between the barrel and endcap. The "Tight" identification criteria is applied. The photon is required not to be from hadron decay. Both electrons and jets can be misidentified as photons, leading to electron-fake photons and hadronic-fake photons, respectively. The functions used to parametrise the fake rates are summarised in Table 2. Moreover, a set of \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)-dependent weights is applied to hadronic-fake photons to scale their contribution down to a similar level as in the 13 TeV analysis.

Jets are reconstructed using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm [29] with a distance parameter of \(R=0.4\) from stable final state particles after the parton shower. They are required to have a smeared \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). Jets from pile-up are added randomly to the event with a certain probability. Jets containing \(b\)-hadrons (\(b\)-jets) are identified with a ghost-matching procedure [30] and are assigned \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)- and \(\eta\)-dependent weights to reproduce a 70% \(b\)-tagging efficiency. A simple overlap removal procedure is applied: jets which are within a \(\Delta R<0.4\) cone of a lepton or photon are removed.

The missing transverse momentum \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is computed from all neutrinos.

Table 2 summarises the above object selection.

## 4 Event selection

Events are categorised into the \(e\)+jets or \(\mu\)+jets channel if their final state contains exactly one electron or one muon selected as above, and the two channels are referred to together as the single-lepton channel. Events containing exactly two electrons or two muons, or one electron and one muon, all of which must pass the above selection and be of opposite charge, are categorised into the \(ee\) or \(\mu\mu\) or \(e\mu\) channel, and the three channels are referred to as the dilepton channel. The lepton \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) thresholds of 25 GeV are high enough that the events can be efficiently triggered using single-lepton triggers.

The selected events must have at least four (two) jets in the single-lepton (dilepton) channel, at least one of which is \(b\)-tagged, and exactly one photon. A \(Z\)-boson veto is applied in the single electron channel by excluding events with invariant mass of the system of the electron and the photon around the \(Z\)-boson mass,

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c} \hline \hline Object & Selection \\ \hline Prompt photon & not from hadron decay \\  & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.37\), excluding transition region \\ \hline \multirow{3}{*}{Fake photon} & hadronic fake (\(j\rightarrow\gamma\)) rate parametrised with Crystal-Ball or sigmoid (pile-up jet) \\  & electron fake (\(e\rightarrow\gamma\)) rate 2\% (5\%) in barrel (endcap) \\  & same \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\)/\(\eta\) as prompt photon \\ \hline Prompt Electron & not from hadron decay \\  & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.47\), excluding transition region \\ \hline Prompt Muon & not from hadron decay \\  & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\ \hline Jet & \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV, \(|\eta|<2.5\) \\  & removed, if \(\Delta R<0.4\) wrt. lepton/photon \\ \hline \(b\)-jet & 70\% efficiency \\ \hline \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) & non-interacting particles \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 2: Summary of the object selection.

i.e. by requiring \(|m(e,\gamma)-m(Z)|>5\), where \(m(Z)=91.188\). In the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) same-flavour dilepton channels, events are excluded if the dilepton invariant mass or the invariant mass of the system of the two leptons and the photon is between 85 and 95, and \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) is required to be larger than 30. The dilepton invariant mass is required to be higher than 15 to suppress low-mass Drell-Yan events. It is experimentally difficult to separate \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) events where the photon is radiated from a top quark (i.e. those sensitive to the top-photon coupling) from other sources of photons in a \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) event. But it is possible to suppress photons radiated from particles other than top quarks. To suppress photons radiated from the lepton(s) of top quark leptonic decay(s), the \(\Delta R\) between the selected photon and lepton(s) must be greater than 1.0. This cut could be tightened in the HL-LHC analysis to increase its suppression power while still retaining a reasonable number of signal events. The event selection is summarised in Table 3.

After the event selection, there are four types of backgrounds to the selected \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) candidates, three of which are events with a misidentified object. Events with the selected photon being a misidentified jet or a non-prompt photon from hadron decays are referred to as hadronic-fake background and events with the selected photon being a misidentified electron are referred to as electron-fake background. Events with the selected lepton being a misidentified jet or non-prompt lepton from heavy-flavour decays are referred to as fake-lepton background. Finally, events with a prompt photon (excluding the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) signal) are referred to as prompt-photon background. Contributions from electron-fake and fake-lepton backgrounds to the dilepton channel were found to be very small in the 13 analysis and are neglected here.

## 5 Event yields and distributions

The expected event yields of signal and backgrounds after event selection in each channel are summarised in Table 4. Statistical uncertainties due to the size of the simulation samples are shown. The differences between the \(e\)+jets and \(\mu\)+jets channels and between the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels are due to the different reconstruction and identification efficiencies for electrons and muons.

The photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) distributions after event selection are shown in Figure 1 for all the channels. The error band represents the total statistical uncertainty due to the limited size of the samples.

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c} \hline \hline Channel & \(e\)+jets & \(\mu\)+jets & \(ee\) & \(\mu\mu\) & \(e\mu\) \\ \hline n(\(\ell\)) & 1 \(e\) & 1 \(\mu\) & 2 \(e\), OS & 2 \(\mu\), OS & 1 \(e\) + 1 \(\mu\), OS \\ \hline \multicolumn{4}{c}{} & \multicolumn{4}{c}{m(\(\ell,\ell\)) \(>\) 15 \\ \hline n(\(\gamma\))} & \multicolumn{4}{c}{1 \(\gamma\)} \\ \hline n(jet) & \(\geq\) 4 jets & \multicolumn{4}{c}{\(\geq\) 2 jets} \\ \hline n(\(b\)-jet) & \multicolumn{4}{c}{\(\geq\) 1 \(b\)-jet} \\ \hline m(e,\(\gamma\)) veto & \(|m(e,\gamma)-m(Z)|>5\) & \multicolumn{4}{c}{-} \\ \hline m(\(\ell,\ell\)) veto & - & \(m(\ell,\ell)\notin\)[85,95] & - \\ \hline m(\(\ell,\ell,\gamma\)) veto & - & \(m(\ell,\ell,\gamma)\notin\)[85,95] & - \\ \hline \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}\) & - & \(E_{\mathrm{T}}^{\mathrm{miss}}>30\) & - \\ \hline \(\Delta R(\gamma,\ell)\) & \multicolumn{4}{c}{\(\Delta R(\gamma,\ell)>1.0\)} \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}

## 6 Fiducial region

The fiducial region of the analysis is defined at particle level in a way that mimics the event selection in Section 4. Leptons (electron or muon, including those from \(\tau\) decay) must have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\), and must not originate from hadron decays. Photons not from hadron decays and in a cone of radius R=0.1 around a lepton are added to the lepton before the lepton selection. Photons are required to have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>20\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.37\), and must not originate from hadron decays or be within \(\Delta R\)=0.1 of a lepton. The photon isolation computed from the ratio of the scalar sum of all charged stable particles' \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) around the photon over its transverse momentum must be smaller than 0.1. Jets are clustered using the anti-\(k_{t}\) algorithm with \(R=0.4\), using all final state particles excluding non-interacting particles and muons that are not from hadron decay. Jets must have \(p_{\mathrm{T}}>25\) GeV and \(|\eta|<2.5\). A ghost matching method is used to determine the flavour of the jets, with those matched to \(b\)-hadrons tagged as \(b\)-jets. A simple overlap removal is performed: jets within \(\Delta R<0.4\) of a selected lepton or photon are removed. For events in the single-lepton (dilepton) channel, exactly one photon and exactly one lepton (two leptons) are required. At least four (two) jets are required with at least one of them being \(b\)-tagged. Events are rejected if there is any lepton and photon pair satisfying \(\Delta R(\gamma,\ell)<1.0\).

## 7 Normalised differential cross-section

In addition to the measurement of the absolute cross-section in the fiducial region defined above, normalised differential cross-section measurements are studied in this note. These measurements focus on the shape of the observables, while the overall rate is given by the absolute fiducial cross-section measurement.

The differential cross-section is given by

\[\frac{d\sigma}{dX_{k}}=\frac{1}{L_{\mathrm{int}}\cdot\Delta X_{k}}\cdot\frac{ 1}{\epsilon_{k}}\cdot\sum_{j}M_{jk}^{-1}\cdot(N_{j}^{\mathrm{obs}}-N_{j}^{b}) \cdot(1-f_{\mathrm{out},j})\;. \tag{1}\]

The indices \(j\) and \(k\) indicate the bin of the observable at detector and particle levels, respectively. The \(X_{k}\) and \(\Delta X_{k}\) are the observable and bin width of bin \(k\). The \(L_{\mathrm{int}}\) is the integrated luminosity. The \(N_{j}^{\mathrm{obs}}\) and \(N_{j}^{b}\) are the number of observed events and the number of estimated background events in bin \(j\) at detector level, respectively. The efficiency \(\epsilon_{k}\) is the fraction of signal events generated at particle level in bin \(k\) of the fiducial region that are reconstructed and selected at detector level and have the objects, that are used to define the observable to be unfolded, matched between reconstruction and particle-levels with \(\Delta R<0.1\)

\begin{table}
\begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c|c|c} \hline \hline Process & Signal & Hadronic fake & Electron fake & Prompt photon & Fake lepton \\ \hline \(e\)+jets & 281100 \(\pm\) 690 & 66500 \(\pm\) 2000 & 50500 \(\pm\) 2000 & 66300 \(\pm\) 4200 & 17200 \(\pm\) 2400 \\ \hline \(\mu\)+jets & 376530 \(\pm\) 800 & 91300 \(\pm\) 4200 & 65000 \(\pm\) 2300 & 104000 \(\pm\) 11000 & 3300 \(\pm\) 1400 \\ \hline \(ee\) & 13950 \(\pm\) 160 & 1070 \(\pm\) 160 & - & 2090 \(\pm\) 430 & - \\ \hline \(e\mu\) & 39960 \(\pm\) 270 & 3010 \(\pm\) 240 & - & 530 \(\pm\) 340 & - \\ \hline \(\mu\mu\) & 21240 \(\pm\) 200 & 1550 \(\pm\) 160 & - & 4700 \(\pm\) 1100 & - \\ \hline \hline \end{tabular}
\end{table}
Table 4: Event yields of signal and background processes after the event selection. Statistical uncertainties due to the size of the samples are shown.

The migration matrix \(M_{kj}\) expresses the probability for an event in bin \(k\) at particle level to end up in bin \(j\) at detector level, calculated from events passing both the fiducial region selection and the event selection, as well as the above matching procedure. The outside-migration fraction \(f_{\text{out},j}\) is the fraction of signal events generated outside the fiducial region, but reconstructed and selected in bin \(j\) at detector level or events failing the above matching. The normalised differential cross-section is calculated as

\[\frac{d\sigma^{\text{norm}}}{dX_{k}}=\frac{1}{\sum_{k}d\sigma/dX_{k}}\frac{d \sigma}{dX_{k}}\,, \tag{2}\]

where the sum is over all the bins of the observable.

The chosen observables to unfold are the photon \(p_{\text{T}}\) and \(|\eta|\), and the \(\Delta R\) between the photon and the closest lepton for both single-lepton and dilepton channels, and the \(\Delta\phi\) and \(|\Delta\eta|\) between the two leptons for the dilepton channel. The kinematic properties of the photon are sensitive to the \(t\gamma\) coupling, while the dilepton \(\Delta\phi\) is sensitive to the \(t\bar{t}\) spin correlation.

The signal sample is used to determine \(\epsilon_{k}\), \(f_{\text{out},j}\) and \(M_{kj}\), which are shown in Figure 2 for the photon \(p_{\text{T}}\) in the single-lepton channel. These efficiencies and migration matrices are quite similar to those in the 13 TeV analysis [31].

The inversion of the migration matrix \(M_{kj}\) is performed using the iterative Bayesian method [32] implemented in the RooUnfold package [33]. The method relies on the Bayesian probability formula to invert the migration matrix, starting from a given prior of the particle-level distribution, and iteratively updating it with the posterior distribution. The binning choices for the unfolded distributions and the choice of three iterations for the unfolding are the same as in the 13 TeV analysis, except for the photon \(p_{\text{T}}\), which has two additional bins of [300,500] GeV and [500,1000] GeV.

## 8 Systematic uncertainties

The systematic uncertainties are extrapolated from the 13 TeV analysis [10]. For simplicity, only the most important sources of systematic uncertainty are considered, that contribute 90% of the total systematic uncertainty in the 13 TeV analysis. Uncertainties related to theoretical predictions, including event generators, are reduced by a factor of two compared to those used in the 13 TeV analysis to account for anticipated advancements in theoretical predictions and tools. The relative experimental uncertainties are in general kept at the same level as in the 13 TeV analysis.

For the systematic uncertainty of the modelling of the signal efficiency, the uncertainty of parton shower derived from a comparison between Pythia 8 and Herwig 7 [34] is considered and reduced by a factor of two, giving 1% for both the single-lepton and dilepton channels. For the \(t\bar{t}\) modelling systematics, which affects the estimation of hadronic-fake background and the shape of electron-fake background, the uncertainties of initial-/final-state radiation (ISR/FSR) and the choice of event generator are considered. The former is derived from a comparison between the nominal \(t\bar{t}\) sample and alternative ones with enhanced or suppressed ISR/FSR. The latter is derived from a comparison between Powheg-Box + Pythia and Sherpa. Both uncertainties are reduced by factors of two, giving 13% (14%) and 4% (5%) for the single-lepton (dilepton) channel, respectively.

The uncertainty of the hadronic-fake background estimation in the 13 TeV analysis is composed of the \(t\bar{t}\) modelling uncertainty and the statistical uncertainties of the relevant control regions which will become negligible at the HL-LHC. For the electron-fake background systematics, the statistical uncertainty of the data-driven method used to estimate the background is ignored and the remaining uncertainty is 9%, which is from the choice of the templates used to do side-band fit in the method. For the fake-lepton background systematics, the uncertainty is taken to be the same as the 13 TeV analysis, giving 50%. In the 13 TeV analysis, the normalisation of the \(W\gamma\) background was constrained with a relative precision of 13% using a template fit method, and this uncertainty is applied to the \(W\gamma\) normalisation for the HL-LHC analysis. For the uncertainty of \(Z\gamma\) background in the dilepton channel, 30% was assigned for QCD scale variation by varying the renormalisation and factorisation scale factors up and down by a factor or two independently and simultaneously in the 13 TeV analysis, which is reduced by half to 15% at the HL-LHC. For each of the prompt-photon backgrounds, except for the \(W\gamma\) in the single-lepton channel, an additional 50% normalisation uncertainty was assigned in the 13 TeV analysis, which is reduced by half to 25% at the HL-LHC.

Experimental sources of uncertainty include the largest and second largest components of the jet energy scale (JES) uncertainty, which are called "JES NP 1" (NP means nuisance parameter) and "JES Rho Topology", and amount to 2% and 1% (1% and 1%), respectively in the single-lepton (dilepton) channel. The "JES Rho Topology" represents the uncertainty of a parameter "Rho", which is to quantify the transverse pile-up energy density of the event and used to subtract pile-up energy from the \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) of the jet. The uncertainties of the event selection efficiency or normalisation for all the simulated processes due to the uncertainties of the integrated luminosity, photon efficiency and pile-up are 1%, 1% and 2%, respectively. Among these uncertainties, the JES Rho Topology uncertainty is reduced by half based on the latest studies with respect to the 13 TeV analysis, while the others stay the same. The pile-up uncertainty has been increased by a factor of two with respect to the 13 TeV analysis to account for the significantly increased pile-up effect at the HL-LHC.

Simulation statistical uncertainties on the generated signal and background samples are expected to be negligible, assuming sufficiently large samples can be generated.

Table 5 summarises these uncertainties. For simplicity, the single-lepton channel systematics are applied to both the \(e\)+jets and \(\mu\)+jets channels and the dilepton channel systematics to the \(ee\), \(e\mu\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels.

In the differential cross-section measurement, in addition to the normalisation uncertainties considered above, shape effects are considered for the uncertainties of the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) and \(t\bar{t}\) modelling and of the QCD scale choice of the \(W\gamma\) (\(Z\gamma\)) modelling in the single-lepton (dilepton) channel. These uncertainties are reduced by factors of two in the same way as for the fiducial measurement. The shape effect of the experimental uncertainties are also considered, except for the uncertainty of integrated luminosity which only affects the normalisation. The background and experimental uncertainties are evaluated by varying the input distributions, unfolding them with corrections based on the nominal signal sample, and comparing the resulting unfolded distributions to the nominal one. The systematic uncertainty due to signal modelling is evaluated by varying the signal corrections, with which the nominal input distributions are unfolded, and comparing the resulting unfolded distributions to the nominal one.

## 9 Results

The expected precision of the fiducial cross-section measurement is studied by fitting an Asimov dataset to a likelihood function built in the fiducial region, which is the product of a single Poisson describing the total number of observed events and a group of Gaussians constraining the nuisance parameters used to parametrise each systematic uncertainty. The resulting total relative uncertainty of the signal strength, which is defined as the fitted number of signal over the predicted one, together with its decomposition into statistical and systematic uncertainties, are shown for each channel in Table 6 and compared with the

corresponding results in the 13 TeV analysis, which are derived from fitting the output of a neural network using data. These numbers are also illustrated in Figure 3. The statistical uncertainties at the HL-LHC are in general below 1% and are much smaller than in the 13 TeV analysis, especially for the dilepton channels. The systematic uncertainties at the HL-LHC are also reduced, as a result of the reduction of the theoretical uncertainties by a factor of two. The fiducial measurement in the \(e\mu\) channel has the smallest uncertainty of 3%. The \(\mu\mu\) channel is less precise than the \(ee\) channel due to the larger background contamination from \(Z\gamma\) events.

The contributions of different systematic uncertainties to the total uncertainty on the signal strength are summarised in Table 7. In the single-lepton channels, the uncertainties of \(t\bar{t}\) ISR/FSR modelling, pile-up, JES and \(W\gamma\) background estimation are the leading sources. If the lepton is an electron, the uncertainty of fake-lepton background estimation is also important. In the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels, the uncertainties of \(Z\gamma\) background estimation and pile-up are the dominant systematics, In the \(e\mu\) channel, the pile-up uncertainty is the most important uncertainty.

Figure 3: The relative statistical/systematic/total uncertainties of the measured fiducial cross-section in each channel for the HL-LHC and the 13 TeV analysis.

In the region of photon \(p_{\rm T}\) > 500 GeV, the statistical/systematic uncertainties are 3.7%/7.4% and 11.5%/3.4% for the single-lepton and \(e\mu\) channels, respectively. The statistical uncertainty of the \(e\mu\) channel is large and one might consider combining it with the \(ee\) and \(e\mu\) channels. But it is found that combining these dilepton channels doesn't help to reduce the total uncertainty, due to the large \(Z\gamma\) background and its large associated uncertainty in the \(ee\) and \(\mu\mu\) channels. Table 8 gives more details about these uncertainties.

The differential cross-sections are unfolded using an Asimov dataset. The \(e\)+jets and \(\mu\)+jets channels are combined into the single-lepton channel. The \(e\mu\) channel is unfolded by itself without combining with the \(ee\) or \(\mu\mu\) channel, since the latter two channels bring significantly more background contamination, making the results of the combined dilepton channels worse in most cases. The resulting uncertainties are shown in Figure 4 and 5 for the single-lepton and \(e\mu\) channels, respectively. Statistical uncertainties are in general below 1% (2%) for the single-lepton (\(e\mu\)) channel, except for the high-\(p_{\rm T}\) bins: e.g. for photons above 500 GeV, the statistical uncertainty reaches 4% (12%). Systematic uncertainties are in general below 5% for both channels, with the background modelling uncertainties being the leading systematic uncertainty. The measurement in the single-lepton channel is mainly limited by systematic uncertainties, while that of the \(e\mu\) channel by both statistical and systematical uncertainties. Overall, a 5% precision can be achieved for the differential measurement, except for the dilepton channel with a photon of \(p_{\rm T}\) larger than 500 GeV.

## 10 Conclusion

The expected precision of fiducial and differential cross-section measurements of top-quark pair production in association with a photon are studied in the leptonic \(t\bar{t}\) final states, using a simulated dataset corresponding to 3 ab\({}^{-1}\) of 14 TeV \(pp\) collision data that is expected to be collected by the upgraded ATLAS detector at the HL-LHC. The differential cross-sections, normalised to unity, are measured as a function of the photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) and \(|\eta|\), and the \(\Delta R\) between the photon and the closest lepton for both channels, and the \(|\Delta\eta|\) and \(\Delta\phi\) between the two leptons for the dilepton channel. The best precision is achieved in the \(e\mu\) channel with a 3% uncertainty for the measurement of fiducial cross-section with a photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) threshold at 20 GeV. The single-lepton channel provides the most precise measurement with an 8% uncertainty for photons with \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) above 500 GeV. The expected uncertainties of differential cross-section measurements are in general below 5%.

## Appendix A EFT Interpretation

The expected uncertainties of fiducial and differential cross-section measurements can be translated into expected limits of the Wilson coefficients of operators relevant to \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) production in a top-quark effective field theory (EFT) [4]. The EFT operators \(\mathcal{O}_{LB}\), \(\mathcal{O}_{tG}\), and \(\mathcal{O}_{tW}\) in Ref. [4] are relevant to \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) production. Their coefficients are denoted as \(C_{tB}/\Lambda^{2}\), \(C_{tG}/\Lambda^{2}\), and \(C_{tW}/\Lambda^{2}\), where \(\Lambda=1\) TeV is the cutoff of the EFT. Their contributions to the \(t\bar{t}\gamma\) production cross-section can be denoted as

\[\sigma=\sigma_{SM}+\sum_{i}(C_{i}\cdot\sigma_{1,i}+C_{i}^{2}\cdot\sigma_{2,i})\,, \tag{3}\]

where \(\sigma_{SM}\) is the SM contribution, \(\sigma_{1,i}\) is the contribution from the interference between the SM and the EFT operator \(i\), \(\sigma_{2,i}\) is the contribution purely from the EFT operator \(i\), and the parameter \(\Lambda\) has been absorbed into the definitions of \(\sigma_{1,i}\) and \(\sigma_{2,i}\). By fitting the above cross-section, either inclusively or differentially, in the fiducial region to a pseudo-observed cross-section set to the SM prediction together with its expected uncertainties at the HL-LHC, expected limits can be determined for the coefficients of the operators.

The unfolded absolute differential cross-section as a function of photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) with its expected uncertainties as shown in Figure 7 is fitted to Equation 3 in each photon \(p_{\mathrm{T}}\) bin with the coefficients of the three EFT operators being free, applying the method in Ref. [35]. A Bayesian probability distribution is derived as a function of the three coefficients. The three dimensional posterior probability distribution is then marginalised to one dimensional distributions for each of the operators to derive the corresponding confidence interval. The resulting smallest 95% interval are summarised in Table 9 for each of the coefficients and for fitting the single-lepton and \(e\mu\) channels, respectively. To convert from the notations used in Ref. [4] to those of Ref. [36], the limits for the operator \(\mathcal{O}_{tB}\), \(\mathcal{O}_{tG}\), and \(\mathcal{O}_{tW}\) have been multiplied by \(y_{t}g_{Y}\), \(y_{t}g_{s}\), and \(y_{t}g_{w}\), respectively, where \(y_{t}\) is the top quark Yukawa coupling of 0.993, and \(g_{Y}\), \(g_{w}\), and \(g_{s}\) are the coupling strengths of the SM gauge group of \(U_{Y}(1)\), \(SU(2)\), and \(SU(3)\), taking the values of 0.357, 1.221, and 0.652 at the scale of \(Z\) boson mass, respectively. The limits are expected to be significantly tightened compared to their current experimental values and the single-lepton and \(e\mu\) channels have roughly equal sensitivity.
